</div>'Older'<p>Ranma landed in the front yard of the Tendou household, and shifted the catatonic Kaoru a bit so she could knock on the door. "Geez, why'd you have to go and pass out like that? Hope it ain't anything serious..." Her attention was drawn, as she heard the door front door open. Trying not to look too damning, Ranma shifted Kaoru to a more upright position, "Uh, hi."<p>Kasumi's greeting smile suddenly dropped into more than passable expression of Nabiki's neutral one, the one she wore when she was extremely upset and angry. Ranma immidiately went on the defensive at the glare she gave the redhead down over her nose, "I didn't do anything to him, honest!"<p>Kasumi didn't say anything, choosing to step out of the house, and retrieve her son from the girl. Ranma presumed she could easily handle his weight, and found her assessment valid. Still, Kasumi's silence was beginning to unnerve her, "I hope he's okay."<p>Kasumi stopped, just before closing the door, "I'm sure he's fine. It's best you run along to my sister's now. I'm sure she misses you."<p>The way she said it, and the cold tone of voice pushed Ranma right out of defensive, and right into anxiously hostile, "What's that supposed to mean?"<p>Kasumi just finished closing the door, "Good bye, Ranma. Kaoru has a lot of his own problems to deal with, without you complicating them. Ranma stood there for several moments, even after the door closed.<p>_<p>Ranma arrived home, still puzzling over the reason for Kasumi's response. Ranma himself knew how happy Nabiki and he were together, and he knew that Nabiki had talked to her eldest sister about the extent of their relationship. If they had talked to one another, Kasumi would have learned exactly how deep it was between them. He couldn't understand why she had such an attitude towards him, or why she seemed so condemning of it. If he recalled correctly, when they first met, Kasumi was relieved that the engagement was passed onto her sister, not angry in any way.<p>Of course, he realized, like he and Nabiki, Kasumi didn't actually expect it to go anywhere. She probably thought of it as nothing more than a joke, until it got out of hand. That told Ranma exactly how much Kasumi knew her sister. Exactly how much love and support was passed between them? Kasumi seemed embittered; giving the world a false front of content and cheer, while inside she held contempt and pessimism. Ranma had to wonder what it was that made her as she was. He was aware of her divorce, but he didn't know the details. Presumably, it was the event that left her a bitter woman.<p>Ranma didn't remember the name of Nabiki's youngest sister, and knew little of her exept for that brief visit she had made when he had just arrived with his father, himself. She seemed to find the whole incident humorous, and took it with good stride. It was obvious she was joking about Nabiki's luck, though it was a bit callous of her to laugh about it. Ranma understood she meant no harm by it, since looking back, he could even find humor in the whole affair. The youngest of Nabiki's sisters didn't seem to have the emotional baggage of Kasumi, which he was sure was due to her sons and husband. Even not knowing the woman all that well, Ranma had to be happy for her.<p>Nabiki seemed a bit more settled. An independant woman proud of her life and accomplishments... until Ranma truly got to know her. Nabiki enjoyed her life, but she was lying to herself when she said she was satisfied and content. She wanted someone to share things with, she wanted someone to experience with her the things she had; from her climb to her position in her career, to the glorious sights throughout Europe, to the simultaniously violatile and soothing coctail of emotions that embodied the concept of love. She lived for her moments, but would admit that she would give it all up for that single person that could bring that true sensation of contentment to her.<p>Unfortunately, her past left her wary of the sacrifices such yearnings demanded of her, making it difficult to even trust a man in such a way, if at all. It wasn't as if she hated men, or was even remotely intolerant of them, it was just that she outwardly decided that their companionship was unneseccary. Within, deep enough, she knew it was a lie, and because of Ranma, she could now fully admit it to herself.<p>Ranma entered the house, and closed the door quietly. As he began to remove his shoes, he looked up to announce his presence. "Where have you been, Ranma?" The pigtailed boy jumped, before turning to look next to him, and found Nabiki leaning against the wall with her arms folded over her chest, and her eyes closed. It looked to him as if she were trying to hold in her exasperation, and he already could guess as to what it was from.<p>"Kasumi called?" Ranma asked, not even bothering to answer her question.<p>Nabiki let out a sigh, before opening her eyes, "She asked me if I would keep you away from Kaoru." Ranma looked away, not able to meet Nabiki's disappointed and pleading expression, causing Nabiki to sigh once again, almost groaning in fustration, "Ranma, why are you going to fight me on this?"<p>"It's something I haveta do, alright?" Ranma returned, still not looking at Nabiki.<p>"Exactly 'why' do you have to do this?" Nabiki enquired, "You're not doing anyone any good, right now."<p>"Look, it's a matter of honor, alright?" Ranma returned, finally giving her a straight answer.<p>Nabiki didn't seem impressed, "Ranma, you take this honor thing wayyyy too seriously. It's good to have a sense of it, but it's overcoming propriety right now."<p>"There isn't much I have more than my honor," Ranma replied, heatedly, "If I just simply give that up, what type of guy would I be?"<p>"Ranma..."<p>"You like to compare me to my Pops, right?" Ranma continued, "Well, the thing that separates me from him is I believe in keeping my honor at all costs. Sure he has his own idea of honor, but he would give it up when things just got to thick for him."<p>"So, if it meant losing everything... and everyone... you cared about, it was worth it to keep your honor intact?" Nabiki asked, keeping tight control over her incensed attitude.<p>Ranma stopped himself from immidiately replying, "It's not like that."<p>"Wrong, Ranma," Nabiki retorted, "It's because of that, things happen that you don't want to happen."<p>"I ain't gonna let something happen," Ranma attempted to placate, hoping Nabiki would relent and trust him on it.<p>"I know you'll try, Ranma," Nabiki replied in a softer voice, "but sometimes that isn't going to be enough. Why do you have to see Kaoru so much anyhow?"<p>"I... promised to train him for our rematch," Ranma said, quietly.<p>Nabiki heard him, and cradled her head in her hand, "Ranma... exactly what in the world possessed you to agree to all..." Nabiki rolled her eyes, "Oh yeah, that misplaced and overexaggurated sense of honor you have."<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed, "Just because I care about the art still, doesn't give you any right-"<p>"Any right, Ranma? It's my school, too!" Nabiki cut him off, "Ranma, you're going by some abysmally archaic ideals here."<p>Ranma snorted, realizing that Nabiki wouldn't understand, "Whatever."<p>As he walked by, Nabiki spoke again, "Ranma... I'm afraid I am going to have to forbid you from seeing my nephew... at least until I get things cleared up with Kasumi."<p>Ranma frose, "What?" If Ranma didn't know better, he would believe Nabiki was attempting to use his own honor against him.<p>"You heard me, Saotome," Nabiki stated, firmly, "You are not to go anywhere near Kaoru for the time being. I'm sorry, but this is for the best of everyone." As her voice lightened up for her apology, Nabiki's expression changed to one of sympathy. She didn't want to do this to him, but things were a bit delicate, and having him stomp on eggshells like he was would not help matters.<p>Ranma turned to Nabiki, and allowed her for the first time to see what betrayal looked like on his face. "Why are you doing this, Nabiki?"<p>"Because I... because I have to, Ranma," the middle aged woman replied, barely able to keep herself from reacting to Ranma's hurt.<p>"I don't see how you suddenly trying to be my mother is something you have to do," Ranma lashed out, becoming angrier at the situation.<p>Nabiki twitched from the sting of Ranma's comment, but gave no other reaction, "If that's what is necessary, so be it."<p>"So, you're just gonna forbid me from training him like I promised?" Ranma asked.<p>"Yes, Ranma, I am forbidding you," Nabiki replied, soundly, "Do we understand each other?"<p>Ranma turned away, "Crystal." As he headed upstairs, Nabiki knew that it would be best to keep an eye out for him.<p>_<p>Soun felt more relaxed and content than he had in years. His constant worries over two of his three daughters had kept him in a tangient cloud of tension for as long as he could remember. This sabbatical he had taken with his old training partner had relieved him greatly of his everyday worries.<p>He did wonder how Nabiki had been getting along with Ranma. His middle daughter was sensible, and did well with the younger generations, so he sincerely doubted that she lost her temper towards the young Saotome. If he were to wager, he may just come home to find his dear girl considering ways to have her own children, after being with one so long.<p>The Tendou Patriarch couldn't believe it, it has already been two and a half months since they had left, and the time had breezed by considerably. He had shown remarkable recovery over his own waning martial skills, thanks to the constant sparring sessions with Genma, and he was sure he stood a little taller than he had before he left. He didn't consider himself pathetic in any means... perhaps he could have shown a little more backbone in a great deal of cases, and he could have settled with his daughters without varying hystronics and 'poor me' schemes... alright, maybe he did appear a little dismal, but if anything, he was more than willing to show his hidden strength when it was necessary.<p>"Tendou, I have to admit, you look like a whole new man!" Genma proclaimed, slapping his old friend on the back. Soun didn't buckle under the hefty pat, and grinned at his companion.<p>"Did it appear that much as I had fallen that far?"<p>"Well..." Genma began, scratching the back of his head nervously, "I have to admit... you were pretty pathetic, the way you cowered before your daughters..."<p>"I didn't see you fairing any better with your son, Saotome," Soun retorted in good humor, "But I suppose it's time I stop treating my daughters like I had. They are fully grown women, and been such for years. They do not need their father's melodrama."<p>"An act?" Genma enquired, sceptically.<p>Soun chuckled, "How else do you get your children to pay attention to their dear old man?"<p>"Well, I just usually call Ranma a girl... but I think that may no longer be the best thing to do," Mr. Saotome replied, sheepishly. He may be a boor of a man, but he wasn't completely indifferent to his own son's plights. It was just that he wasn't sure how to help him with them, and preferred to have Ranmawork them out for himself.<p>"Saotome..." Soun started again, becoming solumn, "How do you think our children are fairing together?"<p>"Why, my boy probably has had his way in the sack with her by now!" Genma bolstered heartily, before noticing Soun's unamused expression, "I mean... I'm sure they're getting along fine."<p>Tendou nodded, standing up from where he had been kneeling in the dense semi-tropical foliage, "As much as I have enjoyed our respite, perhaps it is time to return."<p>Genma frowned, "But... we still have three more weeks!"<p>Soun had to laugh, "Do not fret, my young colleague. There is much we shall still do between here and home."<p>_<p>"Japanese, girl," Cologne commanded, barely managing to control her own temper.<p>"No, Great Grandmother," Shampoo retorted in her native tongue, defiantly, "I will speak with my born language, so that there will be no misunderstandings on this matter."<p>"Fine then, child," Cologne almost seethed at her heir's impudence, "It is apparent you truly do not understand the implications of this situation."<p>"You do not understand the matter at hand, Elder. I simply cannot come between the two of them. There would be nothing between me and a man pining over his true love. Do you expect him to simply forget about Nabiki? We both know the truth on that!"<p>"So you will simply give up? That is not the Couragious Woman's way. Do you understand the ridicule you'll recieve for this? Ancesters, child, I've already practically lied to the family heads in our villiage. They're expecting you to return with a new addition to our family. They're probably expecting a child by next year!" Cologne scowled, and turned away from her Great Granddaughter, "This will not due."<p>"If you have any prodigious ideas or plans that would not leave me in a loveless and unhappy marriage, I humbly await them, Elder." Shampoo bowed low, and even if it was respectuflly, it seemed more a mockery to the old woman.<p>"You dearly try my patience, child. It would be advised you remember your place."<p>Shampoo almost ignored the warning, "I apologise if I sound presumptuous, as that was not my intention. I only request your guidance on this matter, for I cannot forsee any other avenue." Shampoo waited silently, staring at Cologne's back. Finally, after several moment, the young Amazon spoke again, "You were bluffing, weren't you?"<p>"What are you talking about?" Cologne retorted, sounding rather unconvincing, if even a little defeated.<p>"What you told Nabiki at the hotel, you have no true course of action, do you? You and I both know there is nothing of leverage we could issue, nothing that we have that can pry them apart successfully."<p>"There are ways, it may take a bit of time to ponder upon them, but-"<p>"What ways? We could drug Ranma, but what long term effect would that have? We could bribe him, but both he and Nabiki are comfortable with his curse. There is NOTHING we have that will prove effective..."<p>Shampoo dropped to one knee, pulling out her dagger from where she had hidden it upon her, and slid it towards Cologne while keeping her head bowed, "Honored Elder, I am at my lowest before you, unarmed. I can only request you hear my plea, and understand we have lost this fight."<p>"I am not ready to lose you, child," Cologne finally said after a potent silence. Her voice was now weak and almost broken, yet with a twinge of fine hope.<p>Shampoo gave a weak smile, "You would not lose me. Father had found many options outside our villiage, and I have two friends who would be more than willing to assist me in finding my own future."<p>"You selfish... and what becomes of your family?" Cologne once again found her fire, "Do you think so highly of yourself that those back home matter so little?<p>Shampoo had no answer for that, which allowed Cologne to continue, "Your aunts and uncles would suffer ostricization, all because their neice refused to follow or established laws. Because their blood instead chose cowardice than fight. Because you decided to suffer romantic notions than adhere to your duty to your family and heritage."<p>Cologne turned away once again, "To ban you would not be enough... it would be as if you never existed."<p>That shook Shampoo harder than she had ever thought it would. She intellectually knew she could be completely shunned by her family for her decision, but this... and to hear it from one she had respected for her whole life...<p>Unable to hold the tears back, Shampoo rose, and quickly strode from the kitchen, and the presence of Cologne; determined not to show this one last act of weakness within the old woman's presence.<p>Cologne didn't turn around. She knew the state her Great Granddaughter left in. She wished, oh ancestors she wished, that it didn't have to come to this. She wished she could turn back, and comfort her blood, telling her that everything would be alright, but it would be a lie.<p>Shampoo was right, and Cologne wasn't blind. To break apart Ranma and Nabiki would be like rendering a single soul in two.<p>Shampoo walked out into the dining area, looking around frantically. The only option was the exit. She was sure once she walked out those doors, her past life would be left within, forever unable to be reclaimed. Suddenly the door that lead out the Cat Cafe seemed dark and looming, radiating hopelessness and despair. It taunted her with little options, and its glass door presented her with a nation that wore fake smiles, while being only mildly tolerable of foreigners, particularly Asian foreigners.<p>Almost like a presence radiated from it, beginning to overwhelm Shampoo. She suddenly demanded of herself why she had to care so much for both Nabiki and Ranma, two people who had meant nothing to her not too long ago. She demanded to know why she insisted on chasing Ranma across an ocean, she demanded to know why she chose to invoke a law that was even considered archaic to her own people, and she finally insisted on knowing why she chose to battle the obviously innocent redheaded outsider, who had done nothing more than prove her naivity, an ignorance that could have easily been overlooked, and had her work off her debt instead.<p>It was all her fault, Shampoo concluded, and what awaited her outside those doors was simply penance.<p>Just before she collapsed, with tears that had been futily restrained finally breaking from their willed imprisonment, a pair of strong, masculine hands grabbed her arms, arresting her decent. Shampoo sobbed, before turning and embracing the chest of a man who had been a stranger to her much of her life, to her regret.<p>Ku Shui returned his daughter's embrace, heartbroken. He overheard the conversation, and knew the ultimatum made. He then looked down at his broken, despairing daughter, and knew what her decision was. Barely holding back his own anguish, Shampoo's father provided all his soul towards comforting his only child.<p>Cologne still remained where she stood, her ears capturing Shampoo's muffled and ragged sobs as if they were right next to her. This was the hardest decision she could make, but Cologne had no alternative. Too many more would suffer for this ordeal if a decisive action wasn't made soon. Cologne had to wonder, was it truly worth it, to sacrifice her own blood?<p>In a rare fit, Cologne slammed her staff through one of the counters, before hobbiling wearily upstairs.<p>_<p>Nabiki cradled her head between her forearms, as her elbows were propped upon the surface of her desk. It had been a horrible week for her, ever since she and Ranma had that confrontation. Even if she made her demands clear, she knew they weren't being heeded. Ranma wasn't coming home until late, and whenever she enquired, he would simply say he had things that needed to be taken care of.<p>Far from a practice liar, she didn't even need a keen sense of suspicion to realise he wasn't being truthful. The problem was that Nabiki just didn't want to have another fight with him. Ever since she forbid him from coming in contact with Kaoru, it was as if their whole relationship had shifted back two steps; Ranma was no longer open with her as much anymore, while Nabiki herself was hesitant to approach any of the higher levels of intimacy they had already reached.<p>There was a gap between them when they sat together on the couch. Breakfast was spent at separate times, or when they weren't, the silence between them was almost thick and deafening. When Ranma would attemmpt to strike up the conversation, Nabiki blamed her lack of attention to the caffine of her coffee not kicking in soon enough. She hadn't initiated one herself, yet. Their smiles towards one another were tentative, but only vaguely reassuring, and neither voiced their hearts to the other. Nabiki decided that she just couldn't let this go on, and decided that she and Ranma would talk about things that night when she returned home.<p>Then again, much could be said for the period of cooling down between them. She didn't think it was anything truly major. She had almost twenty years of larger concerns, from being considered in downsizing, to major traffic violations (which, she insisted was still not her fault); such a trivial spat over just keeping a distance from her nephew seemed rather trite. Unfortunately, Ranma hadn't had her lifetime experience, and didn't see her point of view. Nonetheless, things would probably deteriorate if she kept her own distance from Ranma, and she was now firm in her belief that he was the best thing that could happen to her.<p>She had another problem to consider. Shampoo had been greatly withdrawn for the last few days. Nabiki had thought nothing of it, until she came back home with several of her own personal items she chose to keep at the Cat Cafe. The middle aged woman had once attempted to talk to Shampoo, and upon reaching the door to her guest's room, heard the quiet sobbing from behind the door. Any concern Nabiki had multiplied greatly, as she carefully opened the door, hoping she could provide any support towards the young girl. As soon as the door was fully opened, Nabiki was met with an empty room, and and open window.<p>It didn't take genius to conclude that Shampoo was avoiding her, because a decision was made on the bizarre love triangle between the three of them. Alright, wasn't much of a 'love' triangle, but things were definitely complicated between her, the pigtailed young man, and the Amazon. The only question left was wether it was in or out of Nabiki's favor.<p>Rubbing the back of her neck, Nabiki used her free hand to page her secretary, "Yuko, any word on today's two-thirty?"<p>"[As a matter of fact, they called a couple of minutes ago. They had a family emergency, and regret not being able to make it today.]"<p>Nabiki bit back a sigh of relief. She wasn't really interested in having to put up her usual front for her clients, even if she was more than capable of doing so. Today, she just felt... tired of it.<p>"[Ms. Tendou... are you alright?]"<p>The question caught her off-guard, almost jolting her to attention, "Pardon?"<p>"[You just sounded rather...]"<p>Nabiki understood that her secretary trailed off in an effort not to offend her boss, "It's alright, Yuko. I'm just a bit tired, is all. Since I'm not going to be seeing anyone today, I think I'll leave early. You can too if you like."<p>"[Understood, please relax for the rest of the day,]"<p>Nabiki heard the click that signaled the conference was closed. Did she really sound that bad off? The stress was probably a bit more than she realized. Deciding it was just too early for a beer, Nabiki decided that a nice coffee shop and a new book would sooth her well enough to face whatever trials awaited her back home.<p>_<p>Ranma knealt down next to Kaoru, as the boy wheezed, attempting to get his breath back, "Hey, easy there, you're just gonna choke yourself."<p>Kaoru nodded, and attempted to concentrate on regulating his breathing. He was definitely impressed with the redheaded girl's level of skill, and figured she was as fast, if not faster, than Ranma was. He didn't believe that she was as able as the pigtailed boy in martial arts, even if she adimantly stated she could hold her own with him. Not only that, he just couldn't bring himself to hit her! He knew he would be damned a thousand times in the deepest of Hells if he were to lay even an agressive finger on the earth-bound goddess; the mortal deity whose very steps made the ground sacred.<p>Then she hit him.<p>Hard.<p>And then told him to get up.<p>Her cold, irritated voice, and the way she said she wouldn't bother with a loser, and how she said she would simply sit by and enjoy the show as Ranma casually throttled him managed to break the slight stigma of radiant, beauteus perfection he had imagined her before. Now, he quite well understood that she could be a real bitch when she wanted to be.<p>Kaoru idly wondered if his father's courtship of his mother went in a similar fashion. He loved his mother deeply, but she could be hard to deal with at times. Maybe it's true what they say, you marry your mothers.<p>Ranma was somewhat impressed with Kaoru's progress, as they sparred in Furinkan High's training hall. The younger boy had yet to even come close to touching her, but she was now beginning to have to work on evading him, instead of it being a casual exercise. She had figured what was probably the problem. Where 'Ranma's training methods were based on his father's 'fustrate him till he got better' approach, 'Rachael's' took a decidedly different approach, which was 'belittle him, while fustrating him till he got better' method. The results were conclusive.<p>Ranma took a chance to briefly glance at the clock, before deciding to call a stop to the session. That entailed suddenly sweeping Kaoru's feet from under him, grabbing him in mid-air horizontally, and then continuing her rotating motion from the foot sweep to heft him away. Kaoru slid across the floor, before slamming into the wall, "Done for tonight?"<p>Ranma nodded, "Yeah, you've made some pretty good progress, but ya got a long way to go before you beat me... beat Ranma."<p>Kaoru let out a mirthless chuckle, "Beat him? I know just as well as you do that I don't have a chance. I can't delude myself that far."<p>Ranma blinked at the defeatest tone, and sat next to the boy's prone body, "Yeah, well... you ain't with an attitude like that." Ranma frowned, when she recieved no responce, "Kaoru?"<p>Sighing, the young Ono brought himself to sitting, and leaned against the wall, "Honestly, do you truly think I could do more than even make him blink? The guy's practically a god in martial arts!"<p>Ranma shifted back from that one, rather shocked, "Y-you..." quickly, she got her bearings back, and attempted to play it off, "Come on, so the guy is really good, but he isn't some divine spirit or something."<p>"Easy for you to say, you're practically there with him!" Kaoru retorted, as his depression started to become evident. "You know? Maybe we're just wasting our time. I apologise."<p>Ranma definitely felt uneasy now, never actually realising how much the other boy respected him. He was just too used to the spectrum that ranged from contempt to wariness, but not respect. Looking down at her lap, the redheaded girl began to consider Kaoru's feelings. All those comments designed to motivate, the way he flippantly dodged through Kaoru's best attacks, and expecting him to simply push himself further... even the congradulations afterwards seemed to be cast in a very poor light now.<p>Ranma now understood, truly understood why the other boy was depressed. Ranma himself had to fight for his father's respect in the art, and fight hard; that's what made him grow to what he was now. Kaoru greatly wished to even come close to Ranma's ability, only to simply be snubbed for his attempts. Kaoru wasn't Ranma, and he shouldn't expect the young Ono to excel like him.<p>"Hey," Ranma whispered in a subdued voice, "I think I got a bit more time, how about we go over a few more things before I take off?"<p>Kaoru paused, looking over at 'Rachael' with a puzzled expression. She had been insistant on leaving on the mark every day, and that they weren't to tell either Kasumi or Nabiki what was going on. Kaoru suspected the imposed curfew was to not attract Nabiki's suspicion; as he remembered when he was younger, his aunt had an uncanny way of drawing the truth out of people. "But... won't Aunt Nabiki...?"<p>Ranma smiled at Kaoru, almost causing the young man's glasses to fog up again, before he forcably recalled the beating she issued him. "I think she'll understand, when I explain things to her," Rachael replied, before bringing herself to standing again.<p>_<p>Nabiki stood in her home, the only one present. It wasn't all that surprising that Ranma hadn't returned yet, and presumed Shampoo was helping at her Great Grandmother's restaurant. Stretching a bit as her muscles began to settle from the day, Nabiki began to consider things to keep her occupied until one or the other returned. Each conversation she was intending to have was going to take a lot out of her, so it may be best to continue relaxing before showtime.<p>Walking into her home office, Nabiki logged into her email account, forgetting to check it at work. Her broadband connection didn't leave her much time to wait, and her mailbox was rather empty, causing her to smile wryly and contemplate how unloved she was.<p>She turned around in her swivel chair, activating the replay on her answering machine. One message, and she wasn't particularly expecting any.<p>"[I bid you greetings, Ms. Tendou...]"<p>Nabiki started a bit, even more surprised to hear the voice of Shampoo's father through the recording. Leaning forward, she prepared to listen intently to the message.<p>"[I apologise to have missed you, yet it is fortunate you employ one of these devices. I have urgency of meeting you as soon as it may be possible. It concerns my daughter.]"<p>Nabiki's concern grew deeper, fearing that Shampoo may have done something drastic. She calmed her thoughts down, belittling herself for jumping to conclusions. The message further allieved her fears.<p>"[She is well, at least physically, yet I concern myself with her spirit. Please, if it would be possile for you to return my reply, I would greatly feel in appreciation. I humbly thank you for your time.]"<p>Nabiki groaned slightly, as the message ended without a phone number. She checked the caller id, finding it there, and dialed it on her cellphone instead of her home phone.<p>_<p>Shampoo's trek back to Nabiki's home was slow, and her only companion on it being her grief. She never officially told her Elder what her decision was, but she knew, just as her Great Grandmother knew, that Shampoo had already decided.<p>For once, you become selfless, and it becomes your undoing,' Shampoo thought to herself in dark humor. She amended herself, knowing that wasn't the truth. It was nearly a lifetime of selfish acts: belittling Mousse, to ritually beating on a poor girl from a neighboring village, to chasing an innocent foreigner throughout China and beyond; they added up to justify her predicerment. Even so, she felt it unfair, yet knew there was no other to blame.<p>She looked up at the sky, finding the somewhat swift moving clouds overhead, overtaking what light was cast into the afternoon sky. Rain; if it rained now, it would perfectly compliment her mood.<p>Those pedestrians who had heard her, turned to look curiously at the lavender haired girl, as a mirthless chuckle escaped her for a brief period. They did not know her, and generally had no concern for her and her problems, but the broken sound of her emission drew a mild curiousness towards it. Then it was dismissed, as she was not part of their own problems, and they had other issue to contend with.<p>Shampoo thought about it. She was the most promising warrior in her village. Because of her single-minded determination, and rigerous dicipline under her Elder, she had gained a great reputation for herself, and the family of Xian, as well as a respect from peers, youngers, and elders. Soon, she would be throwing it all away, and for what, some childish boy and foreign woman she had only met recently?<p>Yes, she was giving it up for them, and she would do so with little regret. Nabiki and Ranma, she felt close to in a way she felt to no one else. She... she loved them both, they were the family she had not ever truly experienced. Nabiki was an elder sister, mother, and best friend, while Ranma was much as she expected a brother to be like.<p>True, she had family at ho... in the Neichiizu village, but they were estranged. When she saw them, they would compliment her on her progress as a warrior, and boast of how proud she made her family and ancestors, yet they never enquired on her wellbeing. They never showed any concern for any of her feelings, believing she was as content as they were. In part it was true, since she never let on to anything else. Her family also never interested themselves in any of her trivial matters, like her hobbies, her particular school interests, even if she was simply having a bad day. To them, she was simply an icon, a representative of her family like an ornamental sword, gladly talked about and bragged over. The only ones of her family that did not treat her such was her father and her Great-Grandmother, as the former was never available, but consistantly sent his love in trinkets and recipes he had created, and the latter always expected more from her, yet was proud of how far she had come.<p>It was different with Nabiki and Ranma. Nabiki seemed to simply make time whenever Shampoo had a concern, almost promptly dropping what she was in the midst of just to give Shampoo her undivided attention. It felt... comforting to know she was more important than simply her status, and she had no idea how much she would miss it if she made the decision that was required of her laws. Ranma often seemed indifferent to her, but she could sense the subtle concerns he would afford her, and the few times they did talk when the conversation didn't drift to the relationship between him and Nabiki, he could provide some rather refreshing insight on things. He could sometimes simplify her point of view, making a situation seem not as dire, like the contempt foreigners recieved from the natives of the land occationally, even in this day and age. His simple reply to that was they were jerks. Crude, and hardly informative, but to hear it from him just made her feel better.<p>The decision was more than just for the happiness of Nabiki and Ranma, she was choosing the sampling of an emotionally more fulfilling life over her old one. At that, she could at least feel more optomistic.<p>_<p>Nabiki sat down across from the Chinese native, looking around from the booth he had selected they sit at. Ku Shui had selected a restaurant away from the Cat Cafe within walking distance, citing to his grandmother that he had some things to take care of. Unquestioned, he was able to meet with Nabiki, hopefully without intervention.<p>Without greeting, Nabiki cut to the chase, "About Shampoo?"<p>Ku Shui nodded to himself, relieved to hear the slight distress in the woman's voice. "It gladdens me to hear your worry for my daughter."<p>Nabiki waved the waiter off, signalling for a minute or two, "I haven't really seen her much in the last few days, and when I have, she's been moping about. Of course I'm concerned about her."<p>Shampoo's father leaned back in his booth seat, "Yes, her current brooding is the reason I requested your audience..." taking a slightly heavier breath than usual, Ku Shui's cheer dropped, "She... has come to a difficult moment, and her life will become far more difficult because of circumstance."<p>"What circumstances are you..." Nabiki leaned back, putting two and two together "So... I suppose you know about me and Ranma, then?"<p>"She didn't tell me, but I made my own conclusions," Ku Shui replied, "I understand your secrecy regarding your relationship. I have personally found often that people may not share such liberal views."<p>"I was one of them," Nabiki admitted, to the both of them, "But... I guess it cannot always be helped who you become attached to."<p>Ku Shui smiled faintly, "No... perhaps you cannot."<p>Folding her hands on the table between them, Nabiki came back to the subject, "I presume you've got a request of me?"<p>Nodding, the man's face became solumn, "I have not been the greatest of a father for her, but I do wish her wellbeing. What she has decided will force us to alienate her from our family." Before Nabiki could demand why he would even consider going along with such an asinine ordeal, Ku Shui forstalled her, "I would simply take her with me, but my daughter would not want to burden me in such a way. She would shortly seek her own path, if only to keep me from suffering her fate for helping her. I would not care, because she is my daughter, but she would, because she is my daughter."<p>Nabiki surmised what he meant, "You know your daughter well, that is true. She's one of the most caring people I've ever come to meet."<p>"Not as well as I wished to have," Ku Shui stated, sadly. "I plead to you, I do not want my daughter's struggles to be unbearable. She was raised to be a leader of our village, and the world beyond is vastly different..." Ku Shui grabbed onto Nabiki's hands, "I would rest well at night, knowing that she had the support of one such as you."<p>Nabiki gapped, before closing her mouth, and looking down at their linked hands. She could feel the blush on her face from the contact, and the man's passionate plea, "I'll, I'll do what I can for her. I give my word that she'll always have me, whenever she needs help."<p>Ku Shui closed his eyes, bowed his head, and grew a broad smile, "My extreme gratitude to you. Your beauty is only matched by your generosity and wisdom."<p>Feeling her heart flip-flop at the compliment, Nabiki jerked her hands away abruptly, "Th-that... it's the least I can do. I really do care for her."<p>"I see you do." the Chinese man laid his hands flat on the table, "You remind me of my late wife. Surely she would find you in approval, as much as I."<p>"W-wait... time out!" Nabiki suddenly demanded, "You know about me and Ranma, that we're together!"<p>"I...ah... forgive me, I had forgotten myself," Ku Shui replied, extremely apologetic.<p>The middle aged woman blinked, before a dawning came to her, "So... that's why Cologne had called you here..."<p>"Pardon?"<p>Nabiki smirked to herself, "Your grandmother's playing a bigger hand than she has. I think... if circumstances were different, we might have found an interest in each other."<p>"I am afraid I don't follow..." Ku Shui stated, genuinely confused.<p>"What better way to break someone up, than by showing the party their options."<p>Ku Shui tilted his head, just before he finally understood, "Yes... that would be a scheme becoming of my Grandmother... I apologise for my forwardness, and I shall... discuss this with my Elder."<p>"You do that," Nabiki stated, feeling lighter in her triumph, "It's probably best we wait to finish this conversation at a later time." Standing up, she nodded her head in bow to the man, before leaning over, and kissing him on the cheek, "But if circumstance were different..."<p>Ku Shui agreed, and let the matter rest at that.<p>_<p>Ranma returned, much later than before, and anticipating Nabiki's questioning. Even if he hadn't noticed the car out front, he was still a bit nervous about it. "Uh, I'm home!"<p>"Hello, Ranma."<p>Blinking, Ranma went into the kitchen, where he found Shampoo sitting at the dining table apparently working on schoolwork. Noticing her puzzled and distracted expression, Ranma approached the table cautiously, "Sup?"<p>"Improving my Japanese. Would do it when not busy at the restuarant."<p>"Oh," Ranma said, heading over to the refrigerator to get something to drink, "Well, I can't say I'm much help, but if you need a hand, I got nothing better to do."<p>Shampoo looked at Ranma, forcing a smile on her face, "Thank you. It would be appreciated."<p>"So, uh, why aren't you working tonight?" Ranma enquired, sitting at the table next to her with two glasses of milk.<p>Shampoo's smile fell, "I no longer work there, or will not in the coming future."<p>"You quitt'n?" Ranma asked, handing her a glass, before starting his own drink.<p>Shampoo put down her pen and gave Ranma her full attention, "Ranma, I and you have much to discuss."<p>"This isn't about that marriage thing, is it?" Ranma equired, guardedly, "Because I can tell ya it ain't happening."<p>"On that, we both agree," Shampoo said, silently, "and I have declared so to my Elder."<p>"Oh," Ranma replied, becoming even more uncomfortable, "Sounds like something serious happened."<p>Shampoo didn't answer that, instead going back to her studying, "Tell me, Ranma, what is it you plan to do in life?"<p>"What is it with you girls and that question?" Ranma asked, "I dunno, I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it."<p>"I once had my life planned out, I knew what I would do in the future," Shampoo stated, contemplating. "What careers would I have available to me, if I were to stay in Japan?"<p>"Uh... I dunno," Ranma considered, not catching the direction of the conversation, "I guess if you get your Japanese up well, a translator, maybe some kinda public service maybe..." Ranma snapped his fingers, "Hey, you're a good martial artist, there has to be hundreds of jobs you can do!"<p>"Have you considered them for yourself?" Shampoo enquired in an arched tone.<p>"N-not really, but I ain't worried," Ranma replied, nonchilantly.<p>"Could you suggest some?"<p>"Uh... Nabiki's sister is in movies... hey, and you could like... be a bodyguard! Especially for foreign businessmen!"<p>"Hmm, bodyguard... I suppose I could," Shampoo mused.<p>"See? There would be more than a few things you can do!" Ranma said, triumphantly.<p>"What happened to the hundreds of things?" Shampoo enquired, jokingly but lacking the jovial tone.<p>"Well... you know..."<p>"Ranma, promise me, okay?"<p>"Promise you what?" Ranma asked, thrown off by the sudden demand.<p>Shampoo smiled wistfully, "That you will make Nabiki happy, for the rest of your days."<p>At the mention of his relationship, Ranma became resolute, "There is nothing else I would try harder for."<p>Almost unoticably, Shampoo nodded, closing her eyes, "Is good. She is very lucky to have you."<p>"I'll say, an old woman like her getting a young stud like me. She hit the jackpot."<p>Shampoo noted Ranma's attempt at levity, "I underestimated you, Ranma. I once thought you to be a useless boy, who sole purpose was irritance and impudence."<p>"Hey!"<p>Shampoo laid a hand on his arm, immidiately silencing him, "I admit to being wrong. You have a great heart, and I am proud that I have come to know you."<p>"I... I guess I'm glad to know you too, Shampoo. Especially since you haven't tried to kill me or anything. You're actually pretty nice and a good pal when not homicidal."<p>Shampoo chose to take his words as a compliment, "You are the first male outside my relatives that I have given true respect to. Only my father has recieved the level I have warrented you."<p>"You're father's a pretty good guy," Ranma agreed, staring at Shampoo's face.<p>"I trust you will care for Nabiki with all your capability, because you just could not do less." Shampoo's smile quirked a bit, before it was exchanged with a serious frown, "I know, no matter what, that I have made the right decision."<p>"D-decision?" Ranma whispered, realizing that the girl was uncomfortably within his personal space.<p>"Yes, my decision," Shampoo repeated, "I have done nothing in vain, because I know that two I care about will be rewarded by my sacrifice. Because you are truthful, I can continue with my life, peacefully. Thank you."<p>Ranma didn't so much hear her last words, than feel them against his lips. Without realizing it, he was leaning back into Shampoo gently. The contact between their lips was soft; a pleasurable sweetness that was savored like a subtle breeze that carried the gentle, lucious scents of flowers from a meadow. However, as sweet as the kiss was, the ones he recieved from Nabiki's lips were all infinitely sweeter. Without even a moment's pondering, he already knew whose lips he preferred to taste.<p>Not quite hesitatingly, Ranma withdrew, watching Shampoo's eyes open lazily, and then hearing the front door slam. Both of them jolted at the loud bang, before Ranma's eyes widened, along with Shampoo's.<p>"SHIT!"
