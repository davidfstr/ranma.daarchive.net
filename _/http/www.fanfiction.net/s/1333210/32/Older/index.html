</div>'Older'<p>Soun smiled, as he and Genma approached the gates to his ancestral home; his final daughter had found that one. Far be it from him to argue her decision on who it was, perhaps Ranma was a bit on the young side, but he could truly see he made her happy. If anything mattered most to her it was his daughters' happiness. His youngest found it, and continues to hold onto it with great ferver, while his eldest unfortunately let it go, replacing it with irrational fear, but as long as they found contentment, he was satisfied. Of course, if things did turn to the worse between Nabiki and her newfound fiance`...<p>"Kasumi, I see you made it home well," Soun greeted, as he entered into the kithen, not even realizing that he had entered his old home until now. The Tendou patriarch hadn't even realized that Genma had headed for the baths, having managed to have his curse ignited from an unfortunate incident on the way home.<p>He found Kasumi standing over the oven, staring down at it with a scrutenizing expression. There was nothing in preparation for dinner, which was a sign that Kasumi was extremely stressed. He knew full well what his eldest and youngest daughters were up to; they far from approved of their sister's relationship, not that Soun could truly blame them. But, one thing he believed was that Nabiki was, if anything, capable on her own. She had been hurt deeply once, but she would know better now. If anything, Nabiki would ensure the sincerity of the boy she claimed to love.<p>"Do not trouble yourself, Kasumi, I think this calls for celebration, you break out the sake, I'll make a call to have dinner delivered!" Soun insisted, knowing Kasumi wouldn't be in the mood to cook, "Oh, and if you would have Kaoru and Akane prepare, I'll contend with Little Sie. I trust he's in front of the television, as usual?"<p>"Akane's not here, she went for a walk," Kasumi replied, almost automatically.<p>Soun's cavalier attitude dropped abruptly. He didn't like the way Kasumi had said that. He full well knew of his youngest daughter's greatest flaw; her hot headed temper, a flaw he had worked hard to rid her of through training in her college years, but never fully succeeded. Kasumi and Akane obviously didn't like the turn out of earlier, and knowing Akane, she wouldn't simply accept things the way they are. Also knowing Akane, she wasn't the most capable of simply talking things through.<p>Genma walked downstairs with his bath supplies, just in time to see Soun rush by him, "[Why the hurry, Tendou?]" the panda's sign read.<p>"Saotome, if you do not wish the mourn the passing of your son, hurry, for time is of the essence!" Soun urgently and gravely stated, as he swung the door open.<p>_<p>"Ah... hi," Ranma greeted in a rather meek tone, as he was held up by his haunch like a scolded puppy dog. The rather irate blue glowing woman glared at him sideways, not quite feeling the jovial countenance that Ranma was direly failing to purvey.<p>"Let's talk," Akane stated in a calm voice, as she calmly tossed him across the street.<p>Nabiki stepped out through her shattered front door, just in time to see Ranma deftly somersault rightside up, landing in a crouch, "Akane, STOP!"<p>The youngest Tendou daughter ignored her sister, as she strode across the street, unphased by the ease of Ranma's recovery, "You probably think you've gotten away with it, don't you? You have my sister and my Father wrapped around your little finger, while you think me and Kasumi are being held in check..."<p>Ranma went into stance, eyeing the woman with concern. He was pretty sure she wasn't intending to throw him all that hard, but the momentum made it seriously difficult for him to recover. He wasn't entirely sure how strong she was, but if recalled, this one was supposed to be the martial artist sister, and that isn't something to take lightly, after seeing Nabiki at work, "What the heck you talking about?"<p>Akane stopped a few yards away, and narrowed her eyes at Ranma. After several moments of silence, she fought back a growl, and continued forward at a faster pace, "Fine, play stupid, while I explain things."<p>"Damn it, Akane! Stop this! NOW!"<p>Akane turned her head to her sister this time, making Nabiki pause at the glimmer of contempt and pity hed in her youngest sister's eyes. "Sorry Nabiki, but you don't have a say in this right now." Akane turned fully to Nabiki, "Kasumi failed to relay exactly how desperately lovesick and lonely you were. You really had fallen low, Nabiki."<p>Nabiki's own eyes ignited, as she pursed her lips at her sister's barb. Slowly, the middle Tendou sister started towards her sister, intending to settle this one way or another.<p>"Nabiki, it's okay."<p>The woman paused, and looked at her fiance` with an expession of surprise and questioning. Ranma smiled at her, and then turned to her sister, "I don't know where you get off calling your sister all that, but if you can't be happy that she's happy with me, then I think it's you that doesn't have any say in this." Ranma once again looked over at Nabiki, his own face letting her know that he has things under control. Nabiki knew Ranma didn't have any idea what he was getting into, but already understood that she loved him enough to place her faith in him. Lowering her head, Nabiki meekly took several steps backwards.<p>At the acknowledgement of his request, Ranma concentrated on the woman opposing them.<p>Akane didn't miss the trade, and snorted in contempt, "Honestly, the two of you act like your so-called 'relationship' is going to work. I'm almost sick at the stupidity the two of you are displaying."<p>"Hey, it ain't your call if we got a chance or not, and even if we don't, it won't stop us." Ranma folded his arms, "And if you don't like it, well, you can just get lost."<p>Nabiki winced; now, things would be getting ugly.<p>"You... little jerk," Akane growled, darting after Ranma. The pigtailed young man easily tracked her, and nearly feigned a yawn for effect, as he effortlessly bent out of the way of the right haymaker aimed for his face. His confident smirk dropped, when he felt her other hand brushing against his knee as he was leaning backwards, and find the back of his knees. He barely felt her using any force, as she suddenly swept him upside down, and traced her right hand from the back of his head, to his shoulderblades, to the small of his back, before it turned into a stiff palm.<p>Ranma was sent flying down the street inverted, before he landed flat on his stomach, bouncing once. "Okay, that hurt a bit," Ranma mumbled to himself, before kicking back onto his feet.<p>He found Akane coldly striding towards him, "You seem to be confused about the situation," Akane stated in a conversational manner, "This is my sister you're leading around, and right now, I'm a litle concerned about her well-being. That concern is being brought about by a snot-nosed punk that thinks he's in the right because he can get an old... older woman to do whatever he wants." Akane cracked her knuckles menacingly, "Why don't you just take your worthless father, and find some other poor deluded woman to mooch off of."<p>"Heh," Ranma started, wiping his hand under his cheek to check for blood, "Funny how highly you seem to think of your sister..." Ranma stood tall, "No."<p>Akane's mouth twitched, realizing the boy before her just wasn't going to listen to her reasoning, "Then I'll have to move you myself." With that, Akane rushed at Ranma.<p>The pigtailed young man stood his ground, concentrating on conserving his movements, and settling for parrying her attacks as efficiently as possible. At the same time, he kept his center of gravity low, and watched out for any forced shifts in his balance, "Hmph, so much for you, trying to beat on guys half your age."<p>"Consider this CORPRAL PUNISHMENT!" Akane suddenly shouted, stepping into Ranma, and suddenly lifting him up into the air, regardless of his defense. Quickly, Ranma grabbed Akane's wrists, and locked his legs around her waist, arresting her leverage against him, "LEGGO, YOU LITTLE PERVERT!"<p>"You let go first!" Ranma retorted, struggling to remove her hands from his shirt. Already irate, Akane exerted force for the first time in their confrontation, tearing Ranma off of her, and sending him rolling away.<p>"When I say OFF, I mean GET OFF!"<p>Quickly recovering, Ranma didn't take a stance, "I don't wanna fight you, alright?"<p>"You don't have to, just get out of my sister's life, and I'll happily let you go with the best regards," Akane retorted, moving forward.<p>"Damn it, won't you listen to me?"<p>"NO, you better listen to ME, you little brat! You waltz in on my sister's life and take advantage of her. You get her to believe the idiot notion that she's in love with you... Damn it, she's acting like she's willing to do ANYTHING for you!"<p>Akane was seething now, as she stalked towards Ranma, flexing and unflexing her hands, "I'll be damned before I see this happen to her again. Unlike you, I DO love Nabiki, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to see that he doesn't get used again by bastards like you and Saito."<p>Ranma's face became solumn, "If there was one thing I would never do, is whatever this Saito guy I keep hearing about did to her. There's nothing I would like more than to beat the crap outta that jerk for hurting the best woman I have ever known, but what happened then was then, I'm with Nabiki now." Ranma swatted his hand wide in an vehemant gesture, "And I'll do whatever it takes to make her happy! She's mine, and if you think you're gonna stay in our way, I'll, I'll..." Ranma took another brief glance towards Nabiki; he could see her trembling. Unsure if it was from the fact that two of her loved ones were fighting about her, fear of one of them being hurt, or Ranma's intense words, he continued, "You ain't taking Nabiki from me."<p>This time, Akane didn't stop the low rumble that built in her throat, reverberating through her whole body. This punk, this uppety little whelp, he was persistant on destroying her sister completely. And Nabiki, suprisingly accepting of all this, would stand by blindly and let herself be destroyed in a obviously go nowhere relationship that will accumilate in taking her job, he social life... her whole livelihood from her, while in the end, she'll end up alone.<p>Shutting her eyes quickly, forcing the small amounts of moisture to splash away in minute particles, Akane let go of her full outrage...<p>_<p>Genma hid his nervousness decently enough, though much of his restraint came from his denial, "Come on Tendou, it wouldn't be that bad."<p>Soun looked over at his old friend and training partner, still dripping wet from the steaming hot kettle he pilfered on their trek across the Tokyo rooftops. It was hard to accurately convey the danger Genma's son was in. Sure he could believe Ranma was a more than capable martial artist; Genma trained him, after all.<p>But Akane, even if she was headstrong in her own studys during he youth, she had developed a deep respect for the arts, while managing to situate herself in a veritable hotbed of martial arts for a good portion of her life. She had met and trained with many of the greatest martial artists around, practiced with many famous instructors, and researched many different forms for both her careers. According to Thomas, Akane also trained dilligently, finding her love in the art which paralleled even her father's. Even when he despaired over her earlier training, Soun was proud of the martial artist Akane turned out to be, even soon to be succeeding him as the master of the Tendou branch of Anything Goes. Unfortunately, she still had that impetuous, impulsive temper that made her pretty dangerous when it wasn't in check.<p>Even as he attempted to explain it to Genma, it failed to relay his urgency. The stout man would have to see the problem up front to realize it's full danger...<p>"Perhaps that will convince you?" Soun suggested, pointing to the blue glow up ahead a couple of kilometers, their destination.<p>Genma blinked, and gulped deeply.<p>_<p>"Anything else, Dad?" Kaoru enquired, not really wanting to return home just yet. Ever since Happosai arrived again, his mother's been acting extremely peculiar. Granted, it may have been because of the presence of the old letch, but from the way she had become withdrawn, the way she had started smoking even more, and the way she seemed almost absentminded, he was pretty sure it had more to it than simply having the elderly pervert raid her underwear drawer.<p>He would probably ask about it, sooner or later, he was concerned for her, after all. But still, to see her like that was more than a little unsettling; perhaps he should tell his father about it. "Dad, I have to talk to you about Mom. She's... Dad?"<p>Kaoru then realized his father hadn't responded to his first question. Even when the older Ono was occupied, he still always managed some sort of reply. Puzzled, Koaru looked towards his father, who was staring off into space with a surprised expression, "Dad, something wrong?"<p>Tofu had nearly dropped the container of supplies he was carrying, when he felt a faint but familiar surge off in the distance. The last time he had the sensation was when Akane nearly beat Saito to..<p>"Kaoru, close up the clinic for me, then head towards Nabiki's with some extra medical supplies and some bracers. I'm grabbing the small emergency medical kit," Tofu commanded urgently, quickly retrieving a white briefcase from one of the cabinets.<p>His abrupt departure left Kaoru blinking, "I wonder what that's all about..."<p>Tofu was immidiately upon the rooftops, attempting to cover several kilometers as fast as possible. There was no mistaking it, Akane was back in town. Tofu had to smile wryly; he was rather hurt she didn't stop by to at least say 'hello'.<p>_<p>"Aiyaah," Shampoo whispered, looking up from doing the dishes.<p>Cologne hobbled next to her great granddaughter, "Indeed, I felt it too. There is someone truly powerful, and angry out there, and it is within the proximity of your sister's abode. Come Shampoo, we must make haste to investigate and offer assistance."<p>"There is trouble about?" Ku Shui enquired, coming up from the cellar.<p>"I'm afraid there isn't time to explain, finish preparing the shop in our absence, for the situation may be dire."<p>Ku Shui didn't question his grandmother, knowing it wasn't the best idea to do so when she was intensely serious.<p>_<p>Long day, then again, they all just seemed to be long now.<p>Ukyo sighed, as she tried to unwind with a magazine and some soft rock in the background, but as usual, it was failing. She didn't think anything of the consequences at the time, nor did she really consider how serious Kaoru had been about Ranma's girlform. No, the young chef understood, it was the way she had used him, someone who had considered her a friend, to get back at someone who had also thought she was a friend. Ranma was surprisingly forgiving, which irked Ukyo to no end. Where did he get off being holier-than-thou, anyways? She sure as hell didn't look at him as the mature type, just someone with a mature fetish.<p>Ukyo groaned, as she tossed the magazine next to her on the bed, and folded her hands behind her head as she lay there. Ranma had proven the more adult in things. Ukyo hadn't even cared how petty her actions were, just savored the small tang of vindication she was syphoning from the whole ordeal. Now, with two friends lost, she realized how poisonous that morsel of satisfaction was.<p>Her reverie was interrupted by the air growing thick with a prickling sensation, much like a lightning storm on the horizon. Having nothing better to do, the young chef got up, and looked out her window, finding nothing but a star laden sky before her. She opened it, and levered herself to the rooftop for a better inspection. Turning in a circle, she didn't see any visible storms about, but her vision was halted towards a spot where the light pollution seemed a bit thicker than elsewhere, and with a slightly blue hue to it.<p>Unsure of what it was, Ukyo decided to drop back into her room to retrieve her battle spatula and bondileer, before moving to investigate. Whatever it was, she may prove helpful, and gods knew she could use the karma points right now...<p>_<p>"Eh, sir? You might wanna come see this..."<p>The vetran police officer sat up from his desk, relaxing a bit before he continued with the loads of paperwork he had to currently contend with. "What's so important that-"<p>He didn't finish, as he saw a small portion of the skyline glowing a faint blue over the low buildings. He grimace, recalling this similar sight from almost a decade... give or take a few years... ago.<p>"I'll get right on having someone check it out."<p>"Ah... no... whoever it was probably deserves it anyways," the senior officer responded. "Send someone over, but it's not a priority. In fact... take your time about it," Yup, Nabiki Tendou was a great woman who had done a lot of good for the community. Whomever her sister was beating the crap out of probably deserved ten times worse.<p>_<p>Akane seethed as she glared at the pigtailed young man. The battle aura was mainly for show, though it did provide a great deal of intimidation to everyone who's encountered it. That and her skill in the art had gained her the commanded respect she enjoyed in her chosen career. Why, she's managed to cowl even the most stringent and difficult actors.<p>And yet, the little punk before her didn't even flinch.<p>Akane's eye twitched at that, "Now, I'm done asking you nicely. You're going to leave my sister alone, or else." Ranma merely shook his head, maintaining his stance.<p>Akane's face changed from cooly passive, to determinantly grim, "Then I will forcably separate you from her."<p>This time, Ranma met Akane half way, not yeilding her the advantage of her own timing to attack. Akane had no intention of permanently harming Ranma in any fashion, but was wholly intending on incapacitating him long enough for her to drum some sense into her sister. For that reason, she limited herself to merely breaking the boy in half.<p>Ranma was fully focused now, unwilling to let the woman gain a firm handle on him, quickly adapting to whatever she threw at him, and improvising counters on the fly; delving from martial arts he didn't even actually have any more experience than seeing in passing somewhere. It wasn't anything like training with his father, or the many matches (and fights) he had been in. She seemed to move from potential joint lock to potential momentum throw to potential limb trap and back; any one of them Ranma was more than positive would leave at least three months to recover from, once the affected limb ws realigned properly. He worked frantically, ensuring that he fustrated her efforts with the utmost caution. He refrained from counter-attacking, praying she gave up so he couldn't make matters worse by either of them managing to do harm to the other. He full well knew, though, that he couldn't keep it up forever.<p>It briefly occured to Ranma that such a consideration never would have crossed his mind in the past. He knew that he was actually *concerned* for Nabiki's sister, even if she was currently trying to beat the crap out of him. She was concerned for their mutual love, and Ranma could appreciate her worry. If he ever found this Saito guy...<p>His restraint was testament to the affect Nabiki had on him. Where once a brash, easily impulsive, and more than impudent boy had been, fought a young man who understood to consider the consequences of things, who had known now how to contend with many more social situations than he had originally even considered, and now knew the urge not to dissappoint someone so close to him that knowing any slight from her could be emotionally crippling.<p>Because of Nabiki, Ranma was more than man enough to withstand the current trial.<p>_<p>Nabiki stood with a passive expression, as she watched the battle before her. Inside, she was anything but what was reflected on the exterior, as she fought the urge to bite her own nails in worry. She merely settled for slightly grinding her teeth, as her fingernails dug into her palm under her folded arms. So intensely has she been concentrated on the fight, she barely noticed her father and Genma landing on each side of her.<p>"Nabiki!" Soun called out, as he landed next to his daughter. Before them, he saw Ranma barely managing to hold his own against his enraged youngest; admirably hindering her efforts, but not making any offensive of his own, "I'll put a stop to this..."<p>A hand shot out, the arm attached to it stopping across his chest, barring him from moving to interfere. Soun followed the arm back to Nabiki, "What is the meaning of this?"<p>"No, Daddy," Nabiki said, simply. She knew full well that Akane wouldn't be satisfied if someone intervined, and it would most likely start over again. It was up to Ranma to convince her, somehow, of his sincerity. She didn't like how he remained on the defensive, she didn't like the way her sister was rapidly growing angrier each moment, but she felt if there was any time she had to show her faith in the man she loved, it would be now.<p>From just two simple words, Soun understood the complexity that was subtly conveyed within them. With a solumn nod, he stepped back, settling to watch the fight with nearly the same expression his middle daughter had. Genma pushed his glasses further up his nose, knowing in his own way that it would be best not to interfere. It may have been confused with cowardness by those who new him in a more negative light, but first and foremost he was a Father, and second a martial artist. It was a battle his son was determined to fight, and Genma knew full well that his assistance would be far from appreciated.<p>From a nearby rooftop, Ukyo looked down at the intense fighting, flipping a throwing spatula between her fingers as she considered making her presence known in Ranma's favor. She knew Kaoru was right about him, and maybe it was a way to redeem herself, but...<p>Turning quickly and holding her small weapon at ready, Ukyo found a humble looking man with glasses and a white briefcase land near her. "Seems I arrived before anything serious happened," the man stated with some relief, as he looked over the rooftop. "Friend of Ranma's?" He adjusted his glasses, whispering to himself under his breath, "Yup, that's Akane alright. Guess she has some problems with Nabiki's current interest..."<p>"Um, you could say that, I guess," Ukyo replied, before looking back at the fight.<p>"Tofu Ono, and you are?"<p>Ukyo looked at the man, wondering how he could be so calm and cavalier when there was a woman glowing with the biggest battle aura she had ever seen, making an attempt to turn Ranma into a complex pretzel shape, "U-Ukyo Kuonji."<p>Tofu's eyebrows raised, "Ah, the ladyfriend of my son's. He's quite pleased with your company, even if it isn't in the romantic sense."<p>"Ono... you're Kaoru's father," Ukyo replied without much emotion, "I know your son, at least."<p>"Hmm," Tofu responded, deciding to get the story at another time, given the situation before them.<p>"Should we help Ranma?"<p>Tofu looked over to where he saw Soun, Nabiki, and Genma watching, but not making a move, "I... don't know. But at the first sign that things are getting grave, I have a credo to maintain."<p>"That seems the rational choice, doctor."<p>Both Ukyo and Tofu turned to find an elderly woman and Shampoo standing behind them. "When...?"<p>The old woman gave an amused smile, "Just now, though I would berate you two for not being more aware of your surroundings." Cologne walked to the edge of the roof, and nodded, "That woman is indeed powerful, yet angry."<p>"She is strong with the dark side."<p>The other three blinked, and turned to look at the lavender haired young lady.<p>Shampoo merely shrugged. "You think I only watch Disney movies, Great Grandmother?"<p>_<p>"DAMN IT, CUT IT OUT!" Akane demanded, finally at her last nerve.<p>"I ain't the problem here, lady," Ranma retorted, "I don't want to deal with this, and you're not even willing to listen to your own sister!"<p>Akane scoffed, "If my idiot sister hadn't lost her damn mind and let her underused, deprived hormones go muteny on her common sense WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS, YOU LITTLE JERK!"<p>"WHAT?" Ranma shouted, shocked at the comment, unwittingly allowing Akane the opening she needed. Locking onto his forearm, she twisted, forcing his back towards her. She then grabbed him by the beltline of his pants, and hurled him overhead. Ranma bounced on his neck against the street almost fifteen yards away, before rolling to his feet.<p>He gave Akane an unamused glare, as he gingely checked the roadrash that was now along the back of his shoulders. That was stupid of him to react like that, and giving her the opportunity. He was sure he would hear about it from his Pop, who he had noticed watching the battle. The way Nabiki was striding angrily towards him, he could guess that she was already prepared to let him have it. It was obvious Akane was good, and Nabiki would probably be angry that he seemed not to be taking her sister seriously.<p>Narowing her eyes, Nabiki kneeled next to Ranma, "Quit messing around, and just kick her ass, Ranma."<p>The pigtailed young blinked, and grinned; he thought the hormone comment was a bit harsh, too.<p>"YOU'RE ENCOURAGING HIM?" Akane shouted incredulously.<p>Happosai had to grin, as he watched Nabiki back away from Ranma, glaring at Akane the whole time. Ranma came back to standing, cracking his neck and popping his knuckles.<p>"About damned time he started participating in this fight," the elderly martial artist commented with some mirth, after exhaling a ring of smoke. "Wouldn't you say, m'boy?"<p>"GET... OFF!"<p>Happosai snorted, and bopped his perch on the head with his pipe, "Best respect your elders, you little puke. Does it hurt once in a while to provide us old folk with a place to rest our weary bones?"<p>The bandanna clad boy growled from under Happosai, "Listen old man, if you don't get off me, so help me..."<p>"You ain't gonna do nothing but relax a bit," the ancient pervert retorted, "This isn't your problem anyways. Best sit back... or lay down... and enjoy the main bout! Even if Ranma's got about as much a chance as a snowball down under if Akane gets serious, this should be one hell of a fight!"<p>"But I need to stop that jerk from beating on helpless old women!" the struggnling boy insisted, knowing that every moment that passed, Ranma committed unspeakable acts against the woman mentioned; that enemy of women!<p>Happosai rolled his eyes, "Did it look like the boy was beating on anyone?"<p>Ryoga paused. Actually, it looked like Ranma was working pretty damn hard not to get hit himself. "The jerk! He's trying to wear her out so he could do greater harm to her! I, Ryoga Hibiki will-"<p>"-Just shut up," Happosai said, stuffing a pair of panties into Ryoga's mouth; pair he had pilfered from a lingerie shop, clean ones. "You butt into this, and I'll be the fourth to make you regret it."<p>Ryoga fumed, but finally relented, "What's this about, anyways?"<p>"That woman you were about to intervine on behalf of was doing the same thing you were about to, stick her nose into something that wasn't any of her business. That's what's going on."<p>Ryoga didn't comment on the obvious misrepresentation of the facts; it was most assuradly Ranma's fault, but the old man currently had the advantage, so all the fanged boy could do was sit and watch.<p>_<p>"Ready for round two?" Ranma enquired, as his expression grew cocky. He didn't want to hurt the woman, and decided he wouldn't do anything further than necessary, but even as his fiancee's sister, no one had the right to make such judgments on Nabiki.<p>Akane settled for glaring at Nabiki, "Call off your dog, before I go one step further than neutering him."<p>"You started this, Sis, I think Ranma's going to finish it," Nabiki responded coldly, but simply.<p>"You've got a lot of misplaced faith in him," Akane replied, in an exapserated tone, "We'll talk about this later."<p>"Yes, we most assuradly will," Nabiki confirmed, never wavering her own glare, and folding her arms.<p>"Hey, can we get this over with, it's getting kinda late," Ranma interjected. His bravado was a pretty good front for the confidence he didn't quite feel. Akane was definitely good, maybe as good as his father when pulling out all the stops, if not better. Then again, his Pop had gotten a bit lazy nowadays. Regardless, he knew it was an uphill battle. The only thing he had to his advantage was Nabiki's blessing, and for him, that was more than enough not to back down from this fight.<p>Akane looked around, noticing the audience they had garnered, including a few neighborhood residents attempting to identify the commotion. Her own father didn't seem very approving of what was going on, displaying for the first time in recent memory his displeased expression when he felt a student had fallen well out of line. Genma was stoic, though from his countenance he was extremely tense. Tofu she saw on a nearby rooftop next to two girls and an elderly lady. Upon finding his expression, she noticed him slowly shaking his head.<p>Great, they were all on his side. Tofu should know better, after all, he was the one that had to perscribe the sedatives to Nabiki over six years ago. Her own father she knew was a lost cause, not even bothering to see past his delusions of his asinine dream of uniting the schools. The others had no business in this.<p>Swearing under her breath, she also knew she couldn't just back down from this. She knew her point was just, and even if Nabiki didn't appreciate it now, Akane was only looking out for her best interests. This whole situation was potentially more devistating than when the last time some arrogant bastard abused her trust and love. This time, no matter what, Akane wouldn't settle for it.<p>"Fine, if you wish to end this, it's a challenge." Akane stated with a deceptive calm, "If you win, you two do whatever the hell you want, I'll wash my hands clean of the whole damn thing. Upon my victory, you leave, and I don't want to hear about you coming near her again, or so help me in whatever religion you believe in, I'll make you pay dearly."<p>At the challenge, both Genma and Soun looked at each other nervously. Happosai paused in smoking his pipe, almost dropping it. Fortunately, it was within his right to nullify the challenge, but he chose on his own honor not to interfere. Of course, being the hopeless romantic he was, the ancient martial artist was willing to make the sacrifice of honor for love. unfortunately, from what he knew about Ranma now, he would most likely honor the pact. "This is a fight you just can't lose, m'boy, better take this to heart."<p>Ryoga blanched at what he now understood what was going on. He hadn't known that Ranma... and Ms. Tendou, that they were together like girlfriend and boyfriend. It wasn't that he was disgusted, it was that he comprehended the stakes. Ranma wasn't his favorite person in the world, and getting broken up with a girlfriend isn't the worst thing Ryoga could easily wish upon his pigtailed nemesis, but he just could no longer find his anger for the martial artist he has spent a great deal of recent time obsessing against.<p>Cologne looked over at her Great Granddaughter, finding a pensive expression on her face. She heard Shampoo quietly praying to their ancestors to provide Ranma with the ability to win this match. Cologne wished she could have the same faith her heir was practicing, but she still held her own hope. To have her own plans that she felt had been more benevolent to all foiled, only to have such an impulsive and rightious woman succeed would not set well with the Matriarch of the Xian clan.<p>Ukyo felt for Ranma at the moment. What was being issued in the challenge was not something even she could condone. She had her own qualms against him, but Ranma seemed sincere in how deeply he felt for the woman. When she had realized this, Ukyo couldn't help but feel a pang of jealously and hurt. Now, it was ironic, that she would not wish the loss she experienced at such a young age upon the same person that brouht it about on her, and she was standing witness to that very event possibly unfolding.<p>Tofu had hoped, at that moment Akane found his gaze, that she would take his silent plea to relent. Sadly, he knew well enough what was going on, and that Akane now felt trapped in the situation. She was still much that headstrong teenager that thought she could right all the wrongs in the world with her martial arts ability. In reality she never realized that she simply thought the ends justified the means.<p>Nabiki was now having trouble focusing on the two fighters, as the well of tears could not be witheld. She was trembling before, but now she was much more visibly shaking; shivering with a gripping fear that threatened to break her of the fragile faith she held. She desperately to interceed, to fight alongside Ranma, to assure the battle would be won. Instead, her resilient belief in the man she loved kept her at bay. She let this go too far, and it was going farther still, and she had no control over the velocity of things. Within her the young teenager from her highschool years was outraged that she had no handle on the situation, that she too freely gave over the reigns. Uncrossing her arms, she then clasped her hands over her chest, "Ranma, please... don't do this to me..."<p>To everyone's dismay, Ranma nodded, and took a firm, bold stance.<p>At the acknowledgement, Akane also nodded, "Then come at me, with your full ability."<p>Both Ranma and Akane met almost directly midway, flying into tempest of motion and limbs. Ranma moved with a speed and ferocity of a demon with the most dire of missions, while Akane moved with a controlled power and refined grace of one who had practiced the art for decades. Ranma was a storm, a hurricane seeking to pummel what lay in his path. Akane was the ocean; swaying crests and roaring waves that saught to swallow and consume whatever prey was foolish enough to challenge her. He would either pound her until she became as limp as a ragdoll, or she would crush him like an aluminum bubble deep within the darkest watery depths.<p>Ranma's right fist sailed past Akane's head, and the woman was forced to sway further when it collapsed into an elbow. She slipped her right hand into the crook of his elbow, and grabbed onto his right shoulder with her left hand.<p>Ranma countered her attempt.<p>After managing to free himself, Ranma dropped into a single handed stand on his left hand, kicking up with his right foot towards Akane's jaw. after just barely pulling her face away, Akane shifted forward with a left palm thrust to his exposed ribs. Ranma spun on his hand, parrying the strike away, as he went into the splits, spinning once like a helichopter propeller. The counter attack proved futile, as Akane simply stepped in to arrest his momentum, catching one of his outstretched legs under her left armpit. She then brought her right leg, placing it behind Ranma's planted hand.<p>Once again Ranma countered her attempt.<p>Akane was forced to roll forward when Ranma used his strength over her leverage by falling backwards, and tossing her while she was still secure onto his leg. Before she had recovered to full standing, Ranma performed a backhandspring to his feet, and leapt into the air with a tight vertical spin. Akane leapt away just in time to avoid the knee Ranma drove into the street, leaving a nasty pothole for the city ordinance to rectify later.<p>After the missed attempt, Ranma leapt into the air to narrow Akane's chances of a secure counter attack. Akane followed him into the air, causing the two to become interlocked in an airborne battle. The pigtailed martial artist forced Akane lower to give himself the advantage, and lashed out with a heavy kick to her exposed chest.<p>Akane smirked, as Ranma fell for the feinted opening, as she twisted slightly, absorbing some of the blow enough to add to her own pivoting momentum, while grasping onto Ranma's ankle.<p>Ranma countered yet again.<p>Akane shook her wrist, wincing slightly at the awkward way it had been twisted, but not proving anything remotely devestating. She had to admit, she was impressed. The boy seemed to just come up with counter upon counter on the fly, even when she had him dead to rights. It was also becoming extremely grating, even when her own admiration at his talent had been growing. She didn't have time to think long, as Ranma now took the offensive; once again pitting kineticly potent kempo against purposely flowing jiu-jitsu.<p>Where hope had been a small flicker, now was an awesome flame. All spectators who observed the heated battle found the sky darkening to reveal the twinkle of the stars above. Akane's battle aura was dwindling. The longer the fight went on, the faster it began to die down; the more respect Ranma garnered from Akane, the larger the seed of doubt grew that she was in the right.<p>It was more than just sheer talent that kept Ranma from becoming mangled limbs, Akane recognized the sheer dedication he must have had to the art. She recalled the vehemance of his pledge to Nabiki, which sang of the same perserverance that he held his own against her with. Could he possibly be the one that her sister needed?<p>Akane firmly attepted to squash those thoughts down. Ranma was a boy, a mere child who thought he was grown. Nabiki needed a man to love her, not someone else's kid to raise.<p>She stopped Ranma's sidekick cold, and stepped past it with a double palm trust aimed for his chest. This time, it was Ranma's turn to smirk, as he kept his left leg up past her head, and hopped onto Akane's forward knee, landing on it with his right. He twisted out of the way of her attacking hands, simultaniously dropping his left heel down across Akane's right temple. As it connected, a crimson aura warred with Akane's progressively faltering violet one.<p>A break in the fight, as Akane's head snapped to the side from the impact, and she staggered. She snapped her head towards Ranma, staring at him incredulously. There was no way he could have simply managed that much force with no leverage.<p>Ranma's smirk grew feral; he scored first blood. The shaken expression on Akane's face was more than enough for him to realize he had the advantage.<p>"That... hurt," Akane growled, switching to striking blows instead of her grappling and trapping attempts.<p>Ranma's expression didn't falter, as he deftly parried the initial attacks. Finally, he was forced to guard one directly, and winced as he nearly felt his guard buckle; the woman had some SERIOUS brute strength. With his guard nearly faltering once, Ranma quickly backed away, guiding and flowing around Akane's attacks almost desperately.<p>Cologne frowned, "She's no longer witholding her ability."<p>Shampoo gasped, as she saw Ranma being forced on a steady retreat. If only he knew the Heavenly Ascending Dragon, the fight would have been won by now.<p>Soun's eyes narrowed at the sudden loss of restraint from his prized student. He had believed he broke her of such a habit, but sadly, it was once again showing in the fore. He also was aware his own master was nearby, probably watching the fight. If that were the case, Akane would have a great deal to answer for.<p>Nabiki continued to stare, until she could no longer handle it. Ripping her gaze away from the fight, she now could realize the painful throb in her chest.<p>Ranma decided it was all or nothing. He couldn't continue this defensive, or she will eventually get lucky. Suddenly, Ranma crossed his arms, and then with a loud shout, he thrust his hands towards Akane's forearms, opening her guard. If he missed, she would have free reign, and the fight was easily over.<p>Akane's eyes went wide at the suicide move that left her now totally vunerable. Quickly, she ceased any visible displays of her power, and pulled it in to diminish the punishment she was about to receive.<p>Ranma's scream never died, as he pounded into Akane's body with lightning fast punches that seemed to come from all about. Cologne chuckled, deciding the first thing she would teach Ranma was the Imperial Chestnuts in open flame technique. With such speed already displayed, it would be intriguing to see his fullest potential.<p>Akane's body danced with the blows, some from her attempts to absorb as much as possible, the rest from the sheer force being rained upon her. The onslaught ended, as Ranma's shout reached a fever pitch, when he followed up his yeti punch with a deep uppercut so powerful that it carried him into the air spinning.<p>The woman's head whipped back hard enough to guarentee whiplash in any other being, while Ranma somersaulted once in the air backwards to recover. As he landed, his own jaw was met with a very pissed off Akane's ax kick.<p>After all that, she was still standing.<p>"Unbelievable," Ukyo muttered, shocked the woman was more than willing to continue the fight.<p>"That took a lot out of her, Akane's probably fighting on sheer will now," Tofu explained, though he wasn't any less surpised to find his former sister-in-law still on her feet. He was pretty sure Ranma would have laid him out for possibly a day with how powerful those blows looked.<p>Ranma buffered the impact by jacknifing into a back handspring kick that caught Akane in her bosom. Turning with the momentum, the furious woman came down with a haymaker towards her opponent. Ranma desperately stepped close, catching her swinging forearm against his back, proving to be a mistake. As he moved to counter, Akane wrapped her arm around his neck, and thrust the side of her hip against him. Twisting, she attempted a hip toss that would have enough force to break Ranma's pelvis.<p>The pigtailed martial artist countered, as he twisted in her grasp, planted his right foot against her leg, and kicked into her gut with his left foot.<p>Akane felt her air leave her, as she sailed back. She caught herself on her shoulder blades, and kicked back to standing, just as Ranma caught himself on his hands, and flipped onto his feet. Not requiring any signal, they rushed at each other for what would most likely be the final trade-off.<p>"Why? WHY ARE YOU SO DAMN PERSISTANT?" Akane demanded.<p>"I've told you a THOUSAND times already, you refuse to believe it!" Ranma retorted, refusing to give in, "I. LOVE. NABIKI! GET IT THROUGH THAT THICK, OVERMUSCLED, GORRILLA SKULL OF YOURS!"<p>Akane didn't even hear the insult, as she literally felt the impact of Ranma's statement. Even in the heat of battle it was unmistakeable. Ranma did love Nabiki with a love that refused to crumble. No matter what the trial, no matter what was thrown at them.<p>He loved her.<p>Akane closed her eyes, as she knew Ranma's final punch was closing in on her. The darkness of behind her eyelids, a scene filled it. Akane, desperately hugging Nabiki, as they both cried. Beyond them, lay a kitchen drawer, the knives that had been the contents spilled about. The phone rang; a call from her then boss who had been demanding her wherabouts. He was the only one that had been calling, as her friends finally ceased in their futile efforts.<p>Ranma's punch wasn't even intercepted, as he reeled back from Akane's battle aura springing back to life in full force.<p>"YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT LOVE? DO YOU THINK THIS IS ALL THAT DAMN SIMPLE?" Akane roared, suddenly on the offensive without even bothering with a defense, "THAT EVERYTHING WILL JUST BE FINE AND PEACHY, BOY? YOU DON'T KNOW *ANYTHING* ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS! NABIKI'S HAD HER LIFE TORN DOWN ONCE ALREADY, AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT TO HER AGAIN! YOU THINK THE PEOPLE SHE WORKS WITH WILL UNDERSTAND? YOU KNOW THE DAMAGE YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT?"<p>Ranma danced around the attacks, finding them uncomfortably close, as he attacked every opening Akane left. She was feeling them, but she was refusing to stop. Gritting his teeth, he refused to stop until she did.<p>'SHE HAS A JOB, PEOPLE WHO RESPECT HER... SHE HAS A WHOLE DAMN *LIFE* YOU'RE INSISTANT ON INTERRUPTING, AND SHE'S MORE THAN WILLING TO GIVE IT ALL UP FOR YOU! SHE'LL LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND FOR YOU WITHOUT ANY CONCERN FOR HERSELF. DAMN IT, DON'T YOU GET IT...?"<p>Ramna saw the blaring opening to the face Akane left. He knew she was now worn; the fight taking its toll on the both of them. He reared back, ready to make this punch count.<p>"...YOU'RE RUINING HER!" Akane punctuated her exclamation by letting her fist soar towards Ranma, as her whole aura seemed to focus around it. Ranma's punch connected first, but it paled in the force that Akane delivered into him.<p>The pigtailed martial artist flew away like a missile, before a car managed to arrest his flight. The impact of Ranma's body caused it to turn over, resting upside down.<p>Akane's battle aura winked out, as soon as she realized what she had done. There was nothing pulled on that punch, and even as resilient as Ranma was, that could have very well taken his head off. Anger was replaced with shock, which was giving into an unsettling fear, "Oh... no..."<p>Her blood ran colder still, as she saw Tofu, the brunette girl, and the old woman quickly leap down from the roof, and rush to check on the unmoving pigtailed boy. The tenseness of the situation grew, as she heard an almost gutteral growl from behind her, and turned as it became a roar.<p>A roar from Nabiki.<p>Akane just barely managed to get up a defense before her sister laid into her with a ferocity she never expected from the middle Tendou sister. 'Exactly WHEN did Nabiki get so strong?' Akane thought to herself, 'hmm, purple aura, Happosai's recharge technique. She still has that nasty habit of feinting twice. Whoa, that would have hurt if that connected...'<p>Finally, Akane intercepted one of Nabiki's attacks, and flipped her over while holding the arm barred. She was rather glad that her sister was in a blind rage, because in Akane's current condition, she would have been in trouble. "Calm down."<p>"STOP THIS, STOP RIGHT THIS INSTANT!" Soun commanded, darkly striding towards his daughters, "This has gone far enough!"<p>"No, Dad, you let this go TOO far!" Akane retorted, struggling to inhibit her still struggling sister, "All this because of your damned fantasies. Are you that far gone to sell your own daughter off like that?"<p>"Get off of it, Akane, he had nothing to do with how I feel."<p>Akane blinked, and looked down at her sister, "What's it matter? It all started because he set you up, and ensured he left you holding the bag when he took off. You know he insisted that me and Kasumi made sure Ranma stayed with you?"<p>"Let go, Akane," Nabiki commanded, firmly. Akane hesitantly relenquished her arm bar, allowing her sister to rotate her shoulder. "You think I hadn't already figured that out?" The middle Tendou daughter stood up, turning towards Ranma. Before she rushed off to check on him, she turned back to her sister, "If he's hurt Akane, I would never be able to forgive you."<p>"Nabiki, this has gone on long enough. He's going to be your destruction."<p>"I don't care," Nabiki growled, "He is the best thing that has ever happened to me. If you're so set on taking away something that has truly made me happy... then I would rather not know you anymore."<p>"You're disowning your own sister..." Akane asked in a neutral tone, "See? You're already losing it. and it's just going to get worse from here. What will do you do? Quit your job because your clients don't approve of your relationship? Live as a recluse from society in general?"<p>"She's right, Nabiki."<p>Soun, Genma, Nabiki, and Akane's head snapped towards the pigtailed young man, who was barely managing to stand on his own accord. "Ranma?" Nabiki gasped, surprised to see him standing, and at what he just admitted. Akane double-blinked, feeling both relieved and shocked to find Ranma alright, and that he admitted that she was right.<p>"You've done so much for me already, Nabiki," Ranma continued, struggling slightly in his steps.<p>"No she isn't Ranma," Nabiki insisted thrown off by what Ranmam was saying, "She's jealous.. or.. or she doesn't understand!"<p>Ranma sighed, and limped closer, "But I do understand, Nabiki. I love you, I really do, but it's been something I've... I've actually been thinking about."<p>"Ranma! What... why?"<p>"It's just that you've bent over backwards for me, and I get the feeling you would do anything I would ask. I may not be the most experienced guy with women, but I'm pretty sure that's not healthy."<p>"That's because I know you won't take advantage of me, Ranma!" Nabiki was beginnin to sound desperate, "Don't do this to me!"<p>"I'm..." Ranma faltered, before looking down at Akane, who looked back with curiosity and expectancy. The pigtailed martial artist then looked around, finding his friends, aquaintances and family standing about him, silently waiting for him. With a deep breath, he did continue, "I'm taking over your life, and I don't know what that's going to do to the both of us in the long run. That... that scares me, more than anything else."<p>"Ranma, Ranma listen to me, I don't care, alright? If you asked me to sell everything I have... You want to keep training, I'll come with you, we can train together! Whatever you want, Ranma, just please... please don't..."<p>Ranma finally made it to Nabiki, half falling into her for support, "Nabiki, I'm not abandoning you, but... maybe I'm not ready to... you know..." Ranma offered a slight smirk, slightly colored by his own physical and emotional hurt, "... be an adult like you."<p>"Damn it, Ranma! That's NOT what I want from you! I don't NEED you to change!" Nabiki's tears held Ranma's gaze, as he felt his will beginning to falter, "I need you..."<p>Ranma's smirk faltered, as he closed his eyes, "I'm... I'm not leaving you... I just gotta think about things, alright?"<p>"No..." Nabiki whispered. She heard what he had said, but she couldn't bring herself to believe it.<p>"I... I gotta go." With that, the pigtailed boy used all the strength he could muster, and broke from Nabiki, taking to the rooftops.<p>Everyone remained as they were in shock, before they thought to take off after him. Everyone's gaze turned to Nabiki, who stared after Ranma's departure, her back turned to them all. "Nabiki?" Akane hesitatingly spoke, unsure of where she now stood.<p>Nabiki turned to Akane with a look that made the youngest sister gasp. The expression on Nabiki's face wasn't of anger, or grief; no hostility or despair. She simply looked at Akane with a face that no longer met the extreme emotions everyone was capable of. To Akane, Soun, Happosai, and Tofu, it was worse than the powerful depression that Nabiki wore all those years ago. To Shampoo and Cologne, it was worse than the excrutiating expressiong of betrayal she had given them at one time. To Ukyo it was worse than the cold expression of outrage she had seen in her reflection when she remembered the abandonment of a childhood friend. To Ryoga it was worse than the outrage he felt towards one he considered a rival.<p>It was the expression of someone who had accepted her fate, and knew she could no longer change what happened to her. An expression of someone who merely existed, a body with purpose, and not a soul.<p>It was the expression of someone who had finally been completely, and undeniably defeated.<p>Without any of her confidence, panache; without any personality she had ever displayed, Nabiki stepped past them all, walking towards her house.<p>_<p>Nabiki entered, absently closing and locking the door behind herself. She was on autopilot; without a will of her own to do anything but the routine. It was late, she would have to work in the morning, and she felt tired, just tired of it all. She didn't even realize she had changed into her pajammas and set her alarm, before she lay on top of her covers, staring up towards the ceiling.<p>She didn't even notice Shampoo come to stand in the doorway of her room; the darkness shadowing her heavily worried expression.<p>_<p>Soun couldn't remember having to do this since his daughters were teenagers. He fought to control his anger, barely managing to retain his pesence of mind to simply yell at his youngest and eldest daughters as if they were preadolecents, and found it a difficult battle. Instead of starting what he had to say, he continued to battle with himself.<p>Genma had his back towards the whole group, looking out the back door to the night sky. This indeed was a great mess, and possibly an impossible one to rectify. Curse his son for being so misguided by that overblown sense of honor of his. If anything, he would have thought Ranma to deny any defeat, coming back for a rematch. Unfortunately, things seemed so... so crumbled.<p>For the umpteenth time since they returned to the Tendou home, he considered joining Cologne, Ukyo, Ryoga, and Kaoru in their seach for Ranma, but knew himself how futile it was. Even with the elder's experience, if Ranma wanted to hide, he would stay hidden. Every time Ranma had hidden from Genma in the past, it took extensive bribes to lure him out. This time, he had nothing to offer that would be appealing in this situation.<p>Tofu leaned against the wall, favoring his ex-wife with a subtle glare. She failed to meet his eyes, explaining to him her guilt in the whole ordeal. He was very dissappointed in her, moreso than he had ever been. Even during the divorce process, he hadn't felt the hurt and lack of faith in her that he did now.<p>Happosai had made his appearance, but immidiately invoked his status to retain order. He was just as livid as the other men, outraged by such interferance in something he had taken a hand in solidifying. Kasumi he knew was out of his reach, and somewhat even expected her meddling to this point, he had only wished he could have fully prevented it. Akane, there he was greatly dissappointed. She used her senority over Ranma, as well as attempted to bully him into submission. No student of his school he would allow that from, and if Soun didn't enforce doctrine, he would.<p>Finally, Soun felt himself calm enough to speak, "At this moment, I have never been so disgraced and disappointed by my own daughters. your pettiness and meddling caused our own sister her happiness. And for what... what reason did you feel this necessary?"<p>Akane and Kasumi briefly glanced at each other. This wasn't the man they had grown accustomed to contending with over two decades. Akane decided to speak first, "We did what was necessary, because we knew nothing good was going to come of any of this."<p>"Well, your interferance proved to be just as malicious as if it were purposeful," Soun nearly seethed, "Did you see your sister? You realized how much you hurt her? Her and that poor young lad? Thanks to you two, nobody knows what's to become of them, THAT is not good news, indeed!"<p>"Damn it, Dad, if you hadn't set this whole thing up in the first place-"<p>"DO NOT RAISE YOUR VOICE AT ME!"<p>Akane shot back into her seat, shaken. For the first time since her highschool years, she had seen her father angry, and as a dominant figure.<p>After seeing his daughter firmly placated, the Tendou Patriarch continued, "I don't care what your concerns were, these affairs were not yours to take part in. Even if it was a doomed relationship, they would discover that for themselves! Nabiki does not require your vigilence over her."<p>"Father, after what has happened to her in the past, do you truly expect us to sit idly by, and let her go to ruins again?"<p>"She is ruined, Kasumi, because of your interventions," Tofu stated, drawing everyone's attention.<p>Kasumi frowned sharply, "And I take it you're now a professional on judging these things?"<p>Ono's eyes narrowed from behind his glasses, "What are you implying, Kasumi. I never liked it when you beat around the bush."<p>"Silence! There will be no bickering!" Soun intervined, before glancing at his eldest, "And do not fault Tofu for your failed marriage. I unfortunately had to stand by, as you allowed your own insecurities and fears obliterate the relationship between the two of you. Has your heart soured that far that you do not comprehend... that you cannot understand the love between two people, regardless of their differences?"<p>Kasumi looked down at the tea table, knowing it best not to say any more.<p>"If indeed Nabiki and Ranma found their differences unable to be settled, they both are strong enough to contend with what would need to be done. They did not want, nor need your help. Ranma is an outstanding young man, and Nabiki is more than capable now of handling her own. If-" Soun paused, looking towards where he heard the front door opening. "Ranma?"<p>"Hello..." an American accented voice replied, "We have arrived as fast as possible. I hope I have arrived in time."<p>"Thomas?" Akane breathed, feeling a good amount of fear grip her.<p>It was indeed her husband who stepped through the threshold of the tearoom, along with her two sons. At the sight, Akane's eyes went wide, realizing how much more trouble she was about to be in. Mr. Morningbreeze noted his wife's reaction, and knew he was about to recieve bad news.<p>"Thomas," Soun greeted with a nod, "I'm sorry we're not meeting on more pleasant circumstances. If you could, I request your presence in the training hall for a few moments to brief you on things. Tofu, if you would take Steven and Bruce upstairs?" With hesitant nod, Thomas allowed Soun to pass him, before turning to follow. Immidiately Akane shot to standing, intent to follow.<p>"Remain where you are, Akane, this conversation you will not be a part of." Soun commanded, not even turning around.<p>Akane's head whipped about the room, finding only one sympthetic expession, "But..."<p>"You WILL not question me, young la... STUDENT!"<p>Akane knew full well that her father had her firmly under his thumb. Akane had given too much of her life to the art, and he just implied that any further argument would make her dedication for naught. With tears welling in her eyes, Akane sat down slowly.<p>"Now, please follow me," Soun requested. Thomas gave one last look back to Akane, before he did so.<p>"What's going on?" Steven asked his uncle in a nervous, unsettled tone, as he was lead upstairs.<p>"Your grandfather just needs to have a talk with your father, that's all," Tofu replied, trying to sound confident, "You know? I bet your flight was pretty interesting, why don't you tell me about it?<p>"it was awesome! I saw a whale!"<p>"No you didn't! We were too high!"<p>"Did too!"<p>Tofu had a ghost of a smile, as he allowed his nephews to bicker while he lead them away.<p>_<p>The door to Nabiki's office had been closed the whole day, leaving Charles curious. He knew full well he was swamped enough with his own workload, and he wouldn't be able to contend well with any retaliation his boss would heap on him for prying into her business, but he missed the charming woman.<p>Wiping his usual sly grin from his expression, and replacing it with his 'official business' one, the Frenchman twisted the knob of the door, finding it unlocked. "Dear Nabiki, I am having issues with the copier again, I was... mon deau..."<p>Nabiki looked up from the paperwork she was reviewing, "You would need to tell that to the maintance. I wouldn't know what needs to be done."<p>"Nabiki..." Charles mumbled, surprised at the woman before him. To most, nothing seemed to have changed about her. Her appearance was its usual immaculence, with a soft color and propriety, and she didn't seem to look physically ill in the least. But Charles was one who enjoyed examing people, even reaching the point to what those versed in the arts of personal combat would regard as 'reading ki'.<p>What he saw immidiately in Nabiki, was not the subdued warmth and cavalier countenance that made her instantly liked by any who met her. She wasn't cold, impersonal, or in any way indifferent. She was just... so not her; so not her in the way that the sun without its glowing radiance was not the sun at all, that a rose without petals was not a rose at all.<p>"Is there something else?" Nabiki enquired, interested in returning to her work.<p>"What... something has happened, what is it?" Charles enquired, not even attempting to beat around the bush in his usual manner. He closed the door to prying ears, wanting only himself to be confidant to what ails befell a friend of his.<p>Nabiki simply stared at him for several moments, before returning to the document in her hand, "Personal issues, nothing to be worried about."<p>"I... don't believe that the case..." The French native quickly moved to the chair across the desk from Nabiki, "Please, I am not interested in gossip, you're very person right now is disconcerting."<p>He waited, understanding he was being ignored, "I will get the answer to my inqueries, I do not wish to go beyond you for them."<p>Nabiki looked up again, and looked down to set the document on her desk, "If you want. Ranma and I have parted ways." Nabiki laced her fingers together on the desk, "Couples are known to break up. I'm sorry if this doesn't prove to be anything profound in revelations."<p>Charles's eyes narrowed slightly. She was being truthful, but she was attempting to downplay the affect it had on her. She hadn't even bothered to fight him in the least over the info; if there was one thing he understood about his boss, was that she enjoyed haggling and negotiating over trivial things. To so quickly yeild to his questioning was too much unlike her. "What brought this about?"<p>"Circumstances that couldn't be overlooked," Nabiki replied, her eyes flashing slightly with emotion, before she quickly squashed it down.<p>"This happened recently? Yesterday?"<p>Nabiki nodded, before picking up her document, and looking over towards the laptop on her desk, "Last night, in fact. Now if you'll excuse me..."<p>Charles reached over, and took the paperwork from Nabiki, "How about we talk? I can handle this for you later."<p>Nabiki favored him with a subdued, irritated expression, "I wasn't requesting you to."<p>"This is a great deal more than a simple breakup," Charles stated, continuing on regardless of any protests she would make, "Was it his age that provided the issues?"<p>"They had their hand in things, but no, they weren't the deciding factor." Nabiki responded, simply.<p>"Then what is it that you believe was the issue?" Charles asked carefully. This was a most direct question, and treading on dangerous grond.<p>"Ranma made a decision, from the looks of it, it doesn't include me in his future."<p>Charles pursed his lips, feeling a faint sense of anger towards the young man who would do such a thing to such a cherishable woman. He reigned his emotions in, understanding he did not know the full story, "And this decision was...?"<p>Again, he was met with silence, before it was broken by the sounds of Nabiki's fingertips striking against the keyboard of her computer. Taking a deep breath and sighing, Charles spoke again, "Nabiki, please do not fight me on this."<p>"I'm not interested in fighting with you," Nabiki retorted, almost sharply. She looked down at her desk, pulling away from it to slump into the back of her chair, "I'm not interested in fighting with anyone... anymore."<p>Watching the facade of normalicy fall from Nabiki at her admittance was like watching a satin cover fall from a ruined statue; a once-masterpiece marred cruelly and viciously. His heart wept, as he simply could only nod, and take his leave.<p>After Charle's departure, Nabiki quietly retrieved the papers Charles left at the edge of her desk, and continued working.<p>_<p>Ukyo landed on the designated building, being the first to arrive. Gritting her teeth, she hoped it didn't seem like her contribution to the search for Ranma was lacking, but it just seemed so futile. They've been searching for him since last night; Ukyo herself even skipping her classes, and keeping her restaurant closed to offer her assistance. Personally, she was positive Ranma wasn't even near the area anymore.<p>He ran away, she knew it, and she was even feeling sorry for him for what he had been going through! Now, she didn't simply sympathize with Nabiki, she understood intimately what she was going through; they were in the same boat, cast away by the same person they thought they could love.<p>At that thought, the young chef wished she did find him, only to continue with her path for vengence, this time compounded with the desire for Nabiki's retribution. How DARE he? How DARE he leave that poor woman, promising her his return so she would wait for him, only to finally realize one day that he would not return. Ranma hadn't changed, not in the least, and she was a fool for trusting in him a second time.<p>"kuonji, I need not ask that your search was fruitful?" an elderly voice enquired from behind.<p>The young chef jumped, "Elder Cologne, I... never mind... No, and I doubt any of us ever will, he's good at running away, learned that from his miserable jackass of a father, I'm sure."<p>"You judge him harshly, though I understand that you have a history with him," Cologne replied, "I trust that his intentions are truly pure, if misguided."<p>"Oh, I'm sure he probably rationalized it to himself just fine. That still doesn't excuse him at all."<p>"Ranma is immature as males are," Shampoo interjected, landing by her elder, "but he do love Nabiki. He does not want to hurt her, even if he does not realize what he do."<p>"Yeah, I'm sure that makes it all right, doesn't it?" Ukyo retorted. "Well, that 'history' you guessed at, it ended with Ranma and his old man abandoning me at the side of the road, after stealing my father's cart that was to be my dowery. Excuse me because of my 'history' with him, but I seem to be finding that history has a tendicy to repeat itself."<p>Shampoo looked down nervously at her great Grandmother, as the elder digested the information, "I won't pretend to condone such actions, but I won't pass judgement unless I have understood more than one side of the story. Hopefully young Ono, Hibiki, and Nodoka will arrive soon, so that we may discuss the next course of action."<p>"I'm here, and I didn't find a hair of him," Kaoru answered, moments later. He gave a brief glance towards Ukyo, who looked back at him with a hopeful expression. It fell, when he quickly turned away.<p>"Do not fault yourself, none of us had found a clear trail to his wearabouts," Cologne consoled before sighing, "He would make it difficult, would he not?"<p>"Well, the jerk always had a way of screwing things up for everyone, I'm not surprised."<p>"Tht doesn't sound very manly of him, but I trust this is a misunderstanding."<p>"I see that you managed to arrive without much labor. Mrs. Saotome I take it was invaluable for her assistance?" Cologne greeted the two latecomers that arrived through the roof exit of the building.<p>"I apologise for our late arrival, but this young man claimed to also be in the search for my son, so I brought him along with me, though he has quite an issue with aimlessly meandering." Ryoga chuckled nevously, but did not make a reply.<p>"You were abrupt in our contact, though it is a pleasure to meet you in person," Cologne stated, having only recognised the woman by her voice.<p>"Yes, that it is, though it is distressing we could not meet under less dire circumstances. Could someone please explain to me these happenings?"<p>"But I-" Ryoga started.<p>"Without raising their voice, and condemning my son to the foulest punishments concieved in the Hells?" Nodoka interrupted.<p>Ukyo looked at the others, finding them hesitant to speak. "Well, I'm not sure what all Ryoga told you, but I'm pretty sure a good portion of it's true. Ranma abandoned Nabiki, and we've been looking for him ever since."<p>"Ranma have no choice in leaving Nabiki," Shampoo quickly interjected, glaring at the brunette girl, "It was on his honor that he must."<p>"Indeed, yet the boy was foolish to follow through with such an absurd demand."<p>"I don't get it, though." Kaoru spoke up, "I can't say I know what's all going on, but why didn't Ranma just demand a rematch? Quite frankly, Grandfather always insisted that a practitioner of Anything Goes never gives up, even if they're beaten to a bloody mass of involintary muscle control... that would be the reason I tend to avoid fighting." Kaoru scratched the back of his head, laughing nervously.<p>"Yes, I am aware of that edict, as well," Nodoka sighed, "My husband always boasted that he never lost a fight, merely postponed his victories. If they find the battle lost, they must continue for another battle until either their opponent refuses, which then automatically forfeits them the win, or they have bested their opponent. They tend to be dreadfully pigheaded about it."<p>"Then, if it is demanded Ranma issue the challenge again, why did he not do so?" Shampoo asked, nervously.<p>Cologne, Kaoru, Ukyo, Ryoga, Shampoo, and Nodoka looked at each other, as realization set in.<p>"THAT CAD!" Ryoga shouted, suddenly brandishing his umbrella, "FOR SUCH AN AFFRONT, I WILL MAKE HIM SUFFER A THOUSAND FOLD!"<p>Nodoka instinctively clutched her right hand into a fist, even knowing the Saotome honor blade wasn't in hand. It was disheartening, as she had thought better of her son. She well knew that her husband would have drummed that fact into their son first and foremost, so it wasn't simply overlooking the option. Ranma just didn't do it, and that demanded answers as to why.<p>"I knew it, I KNEW the jackass was going to do this!" Ukyo proclaimed, finding her outrage completely validated.<p>"Aiyah... it is not true..." Shampoo whispered, "There is something we do not understand."<p>"Yes, I refuse to believe this implication. There is a great deal we have yet to unveil," Cologne spoke, hoping to curb a lynch mob before it started. Shaking her head, she turned from the group, "None the less, I can presume that Nabiki came to the same conclusion. Perhaps it would be best if I went to check up on her."<p>"Yes, Great Grandmother, Nabiki is... not well I think."<p>"Perhaps I should make a visit?" Nodoka enquired, feeling ashamed for her son's actions.<p>"Allow me to guage her, first. It would be best if we kept the damage to minimal." the Amazon Matriarch answered, "If you'll excuse me... it may be a good idea if the rest of you continue this search. Ryoga, please stay with Kaoru." With that, Cologne leapt from the building.<p>_<p>Nabiki turned off her house alarm, before opening the door. She didn't even know why she had turned it on, now. She once had the reason, but it has been a while since it was validated. She considered what she was going to do to relax after work, but nothing seemed to have her interest. Even the hobbies she indulged in prior to Ranma's arrival appealed to her. She had shared them with him, and now they just seemed as if they were something they did together, instead of her own leasurely past times.<p>She calmly removed her shoes, before turning around, and jumped in startlement. "Welcome home, dear," Cologne greeted, smiling widely.<p>To her surprise, Nabiki merely nodded, before walking past the old woman. A bit irritated that she went through the trouble of bypassing Nabiki's home security for such a mild reaction, Cologned followed. "I wanted to see how you are faring."<p>"I'm fine," Nabiki replied, too casully for Cologne's liking. The Matriarch of the Xian family could see what her heir was talking about; Nabiki wasn't as well as she pretended to be. It was as if her spirit was dulled, and her soul was quelled. The impact Ranma's departure left on her was scarring, and would forever remain tender if it wasn't tended to.<p>"I thought I would suggest a training trip," Cologne stated, abruptly. Nabiki blinked, and turned from entering the kitchen to look at the old woman. Seeing she had her honorary daughter's attention, the Amazon elder continued, "Quite frankly, the way you were so easily handled by your sister was appauling for even the most inexperienced of Amazon warriors. Fortunately she is your blood reletive, lest there had been... complications at your rather efficient defeat."<p>Nabiki didn't answer, choosing instead to enter the kitchen. She wasn't particularly hungry, or thirsty, it was just something for her to do in there.<p>"May I take your silence as an affirmative?" Cologne enquired, not allowing the silence to draw on.<p>"I'm afraid I have other business that would conflict with an extended trip. I've already missed enough days at work," Nabiki finally answered, pouring herself a glass of wine that she had opened. She didn't even pay attention to which one it was. Had she, she would have probably baulked... if she had the capability to reach the shock extreme enough for the action.<p>Cologne wasn't so sure of letting Nabiki drink, but noted the woman taking sips from her glass in a way that was obvious none of it actually entered her mouth. "May I ask what else is on your mind? Us old ladies tend to enjoy the gossip of the younger generations."<p>"I was considering dropping my clients. It wasn't necessary for me to take any on, anyhow." Nabiki answered, easily.<p>"That would certainly diminish your workload, I presume?" Nabiki nodded, setting her glass of warm wine on the counter. "I can guess that would leave a great deal of time for you."<p>"I'll probably end up taking more administrative work from my associates, so they can concentrate on their clientelle. That would probably make some of them more productive."<p>"I see," Cologne responded, not even imagining what the younger woman was talking about.<p>"Elder, I'm afraid at the risk of being inhospitable, I must cut your visit short. There is some work I probably need to do before I turn in tonight."<p>"But it is still early, yet."<p>"I would like to get to bed at a decent time tonight."<p>Cologne frowned at the dismissive, absent tone Nabiki responded in, but decided not to push the matter now. "I understand, Shampoo should be returning later on tonight. Perhaps you'll allow her to keep you company?"<p>"She's still welcomed to stay."<p>Cologne sighed, "Then, I will make my departure. Be well, dear."<p>Nabiki nodded slightly, not even turning to watch the elderly woman leave. After hearing the front door close, she took her glass, and went into the living room. she sat down just to the side of the visible divide that bisected her repaired couch; crossing her legs and holding her drink upon her knee.<p>It was now quiet, silence that she didn't miss. She wasn't waiting for anyone to return home for her during the end of this day, nor did she have the notion of picking a movie that would be mutually accepted by her and another party; a film they could both unwind to, and talk with one another during.<p>She was alone again.<p>At this, she couldn't find the tears to cry, though the throb in her chest was unbearable. Her expression was remarkably stoic, considering the pain she felt that refused to go numb. She supposed she should be shouting, bawling like a wreck of a woman, crumbling into some pale shadow of the woman she was... but it just didn't seem possible for her. The man she loved left her, and the friends she retained were associated with him. She exhaled, attempting to drum up some extreme emotion, but the attempt failed.<p>She considered that if Cologne stayed, it would be healthy for her to talk about, it, but the old woman was long gone. Nabiki decided she could wait for Shampoo.<p>Just as she was about to try for another sip of her wine, the cell phone on her night stand rang. "Hello?" Her voice formal and businesslike, far from a comforting greeting.<p>"[Nabiki?]"<p>The voice at the other end produced a mild reaction from the middle Tendou sister, "Jesse?"<p>"[long time no speak, huh?]"<p>Finally, Nabiki produced a faint whisper of a smile, "Yes, it has. Where are you?"<p>"[I'm... back in the U.S. I've been staying with Darwin since I got here...]" Nabiki paused; if she recalled, that was the name of Jesse's... second ex-husband. "[We're... trying to get to know one another again. I'm sorry about slapping you... but you did deserve it... a bit.]"<p>"Yeah, I did at that, I guess."<p>"[I think I recieved the worse of that. Ended up soaking my hand for days. Forgot how durable you martial artist types were supposed to be.]"<p>"Nabiki barked a sharp laugh, finally providing the crack in her composure. With what had escaped, the fissure opened, before the dam was obliterated.<p>_<p>Jesse stood in her morning robe, and looked out from the balcony of her ex-husband's two story home; indulging in the early dawn's beauty; staring towards the east, where the Japanese claimed their domain. She almost chuckled, before realizing that Nabiki was not laughing. Pulling the phone away from her ear and examining it for a sec, she pulled it back to her mouth, "Nabiki? Girl, what's the matter?"<p>"[He left me... Ranma left me...]" The voice on the other end said, finally managing to speak for a moment.<p>_<p>Shampoo entered the house quietly, unsure what to expect. Her Great Grandmother informed her of the way Nabiki was acting, which threw the young Amazon's concerns into overdrive. How did you deal with someone who would give no opening for help? Nabiki wasn't just defeated by the whole ordeal, she had completely submitted. Such a relent destructive to the soul; crushing the heart in ways it was nearly impossible to heal. Even domesticated animals were made to reach that point, for to reach it made one an automation; a machine only capable of assigned purposes.<p>Shampoo could not let the woman she had accepted as a clan sister to be so broken. There had to be a way to resurge her spirit. Maybe she should be continuing her hunt for Ranma, restlessly hunt him down as she had before. And when she finally found him, beat him until he himself relented, in word or in body. She agreed with her Great Grandmother, that how the situation looked was most likely not the case. As damning as the things Ranma had done in the past, Shampoo knew he wasn't callous enough to go to such lengths.<p>The young Amazon then discovered the faintly audible sobs that she knew originated from her hostess, causing both fright and relief in he being. Fright, for she feared to see the full extent of the pain Nabiki was in, and relief that she had apparently had a spark of fire left in her. If she was capable of expressing her emotions, she could be recovered.<p>Concern overriding her worries, Shampoo rushed to the living room, finding Nabiki in the middle of the floor, on her knees, holding he cellphone to her ear. "Nabiki?" Shampoo asked, tepidly.<p>The middle aged woman turned to look at the girl, before looking to the phone against her face, "I... I have to go..."<p>Ignoring the urgent replies of the person on the other end, Nabiki hung up.<p>_<p>"Nabiki, NABIKI!" Jesse shouted, before growling in fustration. Things were a mess back there, and damn it all if she weren't stuck so far away.<p>"Mmm, what was that shouting all about?"<p>The African American woman turned, to find an Afrian American man in grey sweats standing behind her. He brushed his short cut hair in an attempt to massage his cranium, before looking at her expectantly.<p>Jesse looked down at the phone, and sighed, "It's... my friend in Japan, Nabiki. I think she's in pretty bad shape."<p>"Oh," he said, before coming to lean on the banister of the balcony next to Jesse, "is she going to be okay?"<p>"I... I don't know," Jesse said, knowing Nabiki's relationship history. Fortunately, she also knew that Nabiki wouldn't go as far as she did before, but Jesse didn't know what Nabiki may do instead.<p>At the faintness of her voice, and the heavily laden concern, Darwin looked to the sky, "Do you... would you like to go see her again? Make sure she's Okay? I'll help pay for your ticket... if you need it."<p>Jesse also looked towards the sky; the sun now peeking halfway from the horizon. Her silence held for almost a minute, before she responded.<p>"No..." Jesse responded, "No, there are some people there who will help her out. I'll keep in touch by phone." Jesse wanted to take her ex-husband up on his offer, but now knew better against it. He may understand, but it was still a risk to the relationship she really wanted to try with him again. It was selfish, sure, but even Nabiki would insist upon this instance.<p>Darwin looked at Jesse for the longest time, frowning slightly. Finally, he leaned off the rail, "Why don't you try to call her again, sounded like you two got disconnected. I'll go make us breakfast." As he walked into the house, he announced back, "Don't worry about the phone bill, my service is cheap."<p>"Thanks," Jesse whispered. She knew well enough what he said was a lie. He never needed to call anyone long distance, so he opted for the cheaper local plan that left exorbitant long distance charges. She would pretend that she didn't realize that, before attempting to call again.<p>_<p>Shampoo hastefully made it to Nabiki's side, dropping to he knees and giving the older woman a hug, "Are do you fare?"<p>Nabiki switched her phone off, before setting it down, "Like shit, really.<p>"[It is good you have your humor again, sister,}" Shampoo replied, switching to he native language.<p>"{I don't understand anything anymore,}" Nabiki stated, fighting the urge to sob.<p>"{Listen, I was able to find him once, I will not let him escape me again,]" Shampoo vowed, deciding that she would bring Ranma back, regardless of his own wishes. "{I will make him realize that his actions are in great error.]"<p>Nabiki shook her head, "{No, it's not Ranma's fault.}"<p>"{What? Do not seek to blame yourself for this! You-}"<p>"No, not me... not just me," Nabiki interjected, switching back to Japanese, "We all failed him, each one of us, in our own ways."<p>"I do not understand," Shampoo admitted, awaiting an explination.<p>Nabiki sniffled, wiping her face with the back of her hand, "I just could have accepted it sooner, I could have stopped Akane at any time... there're so many things I could have done, but I had to be selfish. I just had to have Ranma prove my sister wrong, when he didn't have anything to prove to me, or anyone else. We were all too busy trying to make things work, that we refused to acknowledge any of the problems we knew would come up."<p>"That is an excuse," Shampoo argued, firmly, "We do not know what the future will present before us. If a thing happens, it will be dealt with in time."<p>"And we'll just live happily ever after, hmm?" Nabiki enquired, looking sideways at Shampoo, "That's where everyone messed up. We decided that this would be an easy ending. We were all just ready to close the book on the story. Me and Ranma are together, he's a man among men, the schools are joined, and anyone who doesn't like it is omitted from the tale." Nabiki shook her head, "Sorry, but my sisters refuse to simply be ignored."<p>"It is not their say, nor do they dictate events that concern your existance. They-"<p>"It's not even just that, Shampoo. The reason I'm not mad at Ranma, the reason I understand he left..."<p>Nabiki pulled herself from Shampoo's embrace, and stood, "...he left, because he made a promise to never hurt me, in any way."<p>"But he did hurt you." Shampoo argued, not understanding her clan sister's logic.<p>Nabiki gave Shampoo a sad, whistful smile, "He thinks I'm better off without him. I guess men like to think that a lot." Nabiki looked around the now dark room, the sun's rays vanished from any available windows, "It's simple, simple enough for Ranma to figure it out first; he stays with me, I risk losing it all. He leaves..."<p>"Then you simply lose him," Shampoo finished. The young Amazon stood up, shaking her head. She decided to once again switch to her native language, in order to express her point as clearly as possible, "{That is not a warrior's way of thinking. To give up on a gambit for an absolute that is still a failure is a disgrace to the persons I know you and Ranma to be.}"<p>"I'm not a warrior, Shampoo," Nabiki answered, tiredly.<p>"{Yes, you are,}" Shampoo stated adimantly, "{You have the spirit of one, you wear the scars of one emotionally, as one seasoned in battle wears them physically. You have taken blows that would topple anyone an iota less resilient, and still you had moved to commit to the fight. You even fought me for Ranma, unwilling to simply let him go, even if you said it out loud that you no longer cared for him, your determination spoke truthfully.}"<p>The lavender haired young woman stood to meet Nabiki's gaze, her eyes never wavering from the chocolate irises that stood against red-tinged whitness, "{Why you choose now to let him go, I do not understand, and I will never be able to do so. Will you simply admit defeat at such a small battle with such an obvious victory in your grasp, or will you strive for your 'Happily ever after'?}"<p>"{It's far from an easy victory.}"<p>"{I didn't say it was easy, just an obvious one. Obvious that you two share the same goals; to make one another happy to the best of your ability, even if it means hurting yourselves in the process.}"<p>Shampoo turned, and headed for the stairs, "{Nothing of a worthy cause should ever be easy. Cheap victories are ones easily overturned. Did you expect this to be easy? Please, be well, Sister.}"<p>"{No, no I did not,}" Nabiki said quietly, mainly for an audience of herself.<p>_<p>Three days since Ranma had dissappeared, three days without even a word from him. Nabiki thought perhaps this was a sign that he was coming back; she had thought him better than to simply vanish, never to return, without even giving her a final good bye, but she wondered if he was just as afraid of the prospect of having to give their last farewells to one another as she was.<p>For the last few days, she had went on with life. Everything that had been routine before Ranma came returned to routine. Unfortunately, she hadn't yet had the heart to take back up her former leisurely activities, for there was no appeal to them; she no longer felt that slight anticipation of unwinding after work with a succulent drink and an old movie, the desire for the warm ambiance and acoustic music of her favorite nightly hangout, the temptation of an aimless drive around the Tokyo highways. None of it gained her interest any longer.<p>She had began taking more work home with her, in order to fill some of the past time she had now gained. Almost immidiately, the difference in workload at the office was noticeable, along with the curt and almost clipped meetings she now held with her clientelle. Very little personal exchange was given with them, and what minute amount that had been discussed was one sided.<p>Nabiki was drained. It wasn't the same as the hollow, painful void that would not allow her to comprehend her own emotions that she had gained upon watching Ranma make his escape; it was like a large hole in the container that was her heart had allowed all the sanguine to seep from it, only to be filled with the minimal necessary until the rupture was repaired. Sadly, she herself didn't think it ever would be, not without it being Ranma who mended it.<p>She shifted through the papers she had brought home with herself, sitting at her computer desk, uninterested in the world around her. Only the inoften sound of the doorbell ringing capturing her attention. She was aware that Shampoo had not yet returned home, and went to answer the door herself, only mildly curious as to who was visiting.<p>"Hello," Nabiki greeted without much cheer, as she opened the door, and her expression didn't change, when she found who was there, "I was wondering when you would probably come to give me a pep talk."<p>"Greetings Nabiki," Soun returned, "I won't patronize you by enquiring how you're faring."<p>"Actually, I'm doing better than you probably assumed," the middle Tendou daughter answered, stepping aside for her father's entrance.<p>Soun wasn't sure how to take such news, deciding to pretend oblivious to the underlying problem, "Then I am relieved, although from the last I had seen you, I couldn't be so assured."<p>Nabiki led her father into the living room, "I was hit pretty hard by it, but life goes on. It wasn't as if things weren't inevitable, even if we did decide to try at one point."<p>"Do you believe it's so simple?" the Tendou Patriarch enquired, "There was no denial in the fact you loved him, and he loved you. Nothing could be more tragic than if one of you were to have perished."<p>"Like when Mom died?" Nabiki returned, looking out the nearest window, "We had thought it had really did a number on you... how long have you been acting?"<p>Soun would have smiled in slyness, but it did not do for the current situation, "I apologise. I have had my reasons, I assure you."<p>"And those are?"<p>Soun sighed, before sitting on the couch. He noted the sewn slash through the middle of it, but thought to enquire about it later, "When your mother died, I did... despair... for a time. But time does mend all wounds, even if scars are left in their stead."<p>"But that was not what I asked, Daddy."<p>"Well," Nabiki's father interlaced his fingers together, hunching over in his seat, "You girls were the only things I truly believed I had left. All of you have grown up, and have done me proud; managing very successful carreers, or raising a family, I could not have asked much more of any of you, exept to have each and every one of you girls' happiness completed. I fretted, yet, that you girls would soon grow distant from your dear old father, and I admit to a great deal of guile in order to regain your attention from time to time..."<p>"Like every time you felt the need to revise your will?" Nabiki asked.<p>"Well..." Soun started, a bit nervous, "On that..."<p>"Or when you started visiting the hospital every week, and informmed us you thought you were dying?"<p>"I guess that was a bit irresponsible of me, but believe me when-"<p>"Or when you sold the house and property?" Nabiki's voice took on a sharp tone.<p>"Ah... heh... the broker was a friend of mine... there was no danger in-"<p>"It took me almost a month to get that deed back!"<p>"It was in safe keeping, though I appreciate the effort you-"<p>"Didn't you think I had anything better to do than simply contend with your attention deficiet crisises?" Nabiki demanded, whirling on her father, "And this time, you pretend to engage me to someone, simply because you couldn't simply be bothered TO DROP BY MY NEIGHBORHOOD?"<p>Soun would have been happy for the sudden vigor his daughter was displaying, if it weren't directed towards him in such a hostile manner, "Nabiki, I couldn't imagine the current repercussions at the time; there is no limit to the amount of sorrow I feel at this outcome. Your sisters were thoroughly repremanded, I assure you, yet I sincerely do not believe I have done enough to atone."<p>"You're DAMNED right! I loved him, I thought I found someone who I could trust completely. you engaged me to the one who I ended up caring the most for of anyone, and then that's RIPPED away from me... and for what reason?" Nabiki's face was beginning to scrunch up from the pain in her heart, as her eyes welled with tears, "...so my father could say 'hi' to his daughters, and then go sightseeing gods know WHERE in the world!"<p>Nabiki turned away, brushing the left side of her hair to behind her ear, "Ranma... I understand what he did, because he's doing what he thinks is right. But you betraying me like this... Daddy... how could you?"<p>"Oh, Nabiki," Soun almost moaned, realizing the extent of his folly. Silently, he stood up, and approached his offspring cautiously from behind. He enveloped her in a hug, lending the distraught woman the strength only a father could instill on his daughter. Nabiki trembled a bit, before settling into the embrace, receiving it like a daughter who needed the support only a father could give.<p>Kissing her on the head, Soun spoke, "I admit to my selfishness, that I was blind to your own plights. Curse me as being such an irresponsible parent, but do not think any less of me. No matter what, I do put you girls before myself, and if I didn't expect such an outcome between you and Ranma, I give my full blessings. I only wish for your happiness."<p>"Well, it's a bit late for that, isn't it?" Nabiki responded, "Ranma's gone."<p>"He shall not remain absent forever, the two of you I can see are greater than this travesty orchestrated by your sisters. Do not give up or despair, just believe that if he is truly doing what his heart leads him to believe as best, his path will return to us... to you."<p>"I would like to believe that, Daddy, I really would... but I don't know if I have much more investment in faith." Nabiki pulled away, and went to stand by her DVD collection, absently scanning it with her eyes, "For what its worth, I'm not mad at you, or Ranma, or even at Akane and Kasumi. I can't even say I'm mad at anything anymore, just hurt."<p>The middle Tendou sister turned to her father with a subtly yearning expression, tinted with an undertone of sadness, and highlighted with a light huing of wistfulness, "Ranma... was the best thing that happened to me, and I thank him for the time we did have together, even if it was short. I can wish him well, but I know I'll never find anyone beyond him again." Nabiki chuckled slightly; the false mirth broken by her sadness, as it chocked through the sanguine expression, "I'm sorry, Daddy, but in finding ultimate happiness, I think I've failed in the fact that it didn't last."<p>"I would be lying if I believed you girls could be happy forever," Soun replied, "But you did find it, even if it was fleeting. The question is, do you still desire it? Also, are you willing to perhaps be a little selfish of your own?"<p>"I don't know, Daddy, I just don't know." Nabiki whispered. Instead she favored her father with an unreadable expression that confirmed nor defied the questions asked of her.<p>Her expression was uneadable to anyone but her father. With a slight nod, he turned, and left, having little more he could say or offer at that moment.<p>_<p>On the fourth day, Ukyo was assured that Ranma was not returning. Just like he had those ten year ago, he abandoned his obligations, never having any intentions of honoring them. The difference she noted was that he decided to leave his worthless father behind. She didn't blame him, since the old man was nothing but hindering baggage, but it still didn't speak lightly of the pigtailed martial artist.<p>The young chef scoffed, as she finished the preparations for the current dish of okonomiyaki, and flipped it onto the plate of one of the few remaining customers she had. She had a suspicion that her mood for the last couple of weeks had something to do with her dwindling business; the whole mess with Ranma just turned the downslide even sharper. Just as well, she had been considering closing up shop, anyhow, regardless of how expensive and costly an action would be. She... no longer had friends in Nerima, and the income of her livelihood barely trickled in enough for her to get by. By her estimates, she may fall too far in the red in just a couple of months. True, she could simply just liven herself up, but she didn't feel the obligation to.<p>If she did leave, she had no intentions of chasing after Ranma. In a strange way, she already felt vindicated, for even if she didn't get her revenge, Ranma's reputation was already tarnished to his friends and family; he was now most likely a castout, a blacksheep like she was to her family. He now should know how she felt, and in that, she was satisfied.<p>Because of the relationship they shared, Ukyo wasn't interested in returning home to her family. Granted, they would begrudingly accept her back, but she knew what she would have in store for her, which made the prospect less than appealing. She idly wondered how the competition was up north, while distastefully considering the colder climate.<p>She looked up, and accepted the payment for the meal she had just offered. The man had finished rather quickly, she noted, he must have noticed her scowling again. Looking through the empty restaurant, Ukyo sighed. This just wasn't going to do. Even if she wanted to leave, she needed to build up enough revenue to do so. With a sigh, she began to clean her grill, as she has been exessively, just as she heard the door chime again.<p>With her mind made up to improve her circumstance, Ukyo managed a convincing smile, "Welcome to Ukyo's, Sugar, why don't you take a seat and... Ms. Tendou?"<p>"Ukyo," Nabiki greeted, taking a seat at the bar.<p>"Um, well, um... what brings you here?" the young chef asked, finding her to be the second to last person she would see in a long time, next to Ranma.<p>Nabiki managed a wry smile that didn't touch her eyes, "Ranma used to tell me how great your cooking was, and I was in the neighborhood."<p>"Why don't you just tell me you came to talk?" Ukyo responded, leaning at the edge of the grill, just shy of touching it, "We both know that's what you're interested in, not in my cooking ability."<p>"It is obvious, isn't it?" the middle aged woman replied, "But I think I will give your food a try, just to settle my own curiosity."<p>Ukyo shrugged, deciding to oblige Nabiki, and poured the batter on the grill, "What'll it be?"<p>"Um... surprise me."<p>"One surprise, on it's way," Ukyo turned from the grill sec to gather ingredients, "Good to see you're doing better than the last time I saw you."<p>"I look better, doesn't necessarily mean that I am better," Nabiki replied.<p>"I guess you have a point there, Sug... Ms. Tendou."<p>"Ukyo, I'm not mad at Ranma... and neither should you be."<p>Ukyo almost cut her hand off, slicing vegetables, "What?"<p>"Ranma took off for a reason, one he thought was a good reason, it may not be the best of reasons, but he did it with the best of intentions."<p>"The best of intentions when it comes to saving his hide..." Ukyo retorted, "I can't believe you're still fawning over that jerk. Even a woman at your age can do MUCH, MUCH better than him!"<p>"Gee, thanks," Nabiki responded, dryly, "but I didn't think you would undestand that. You know the day Ranma and Kaoru found out about what you were doing between them?" From the way Ukyo's back stiffened, Nabiki guessed she did. With a sharp glare towards the younger woman's back, the middle aged woman continued, "Ranma even asked me not to do anything about it, but I think I just can't let it slide that easily, since it affected both him and my nephew."<p>"Don't even pretend you're innocent, Ms. Tendou," Ukyo returned, sharply, "It WAS Ranma that told Kaoru about the curse, after all, not you."<p>"Probably because it was his decision," Nabiki stated, though not completely hiding her guilt. She pushed it away, in order to continue, "You, on the other hand perpetuated the whole situation. They were both upset that someone they had considered a good friend would do that to either of them... do you know how Ranma was, that night, when he came home?"<p>Ukyo shook her head, though she recalled from the state he was in when he left, he was pretty bad off.<p>"Ukyo, even if he hadn't seen you in a while, Ranma loved you like a best friend. That's sadly not saying much, since considering how few friends he's probably had. Kaoru, Shampoo, Ku Shui Tofu, Cologne... me... we're all friends he's just made within the last three months. I think Ryoga has only known Ranma for little more than a year. You... go pretty far back with him, and that meant a LOT to him, still means a lot to him. Do you have truly any idea how much you had possibly hurt him?"<p>"Does he know how much he hurt me? I've lost TEN YEARS of my life because of that uncaring jerk and his father! And when I finally find him, you know what he does? He acts like nothing ever happened! You're asking me if I knew how he felt? He didn't even CARE how I felt!"<p>Nabiki closed her eyes, and shook her head, "Bull. I know it, but I don't think you even cared to consider it."<p>Ukyo scoffed, and served Nabiki her okonomiyaki, "Then, 'oh-wise-one', why don't you enlighten me? Oh, and that *was* a crack about your age."<p>"I got in contact with your father."<p>At that, Ukyo's eyes went wide.<p>"I was surprised to hear that he had barely heard from you within the last six years. Did you know he even filed a missing persons report on you a while back? You're still under age, you know?"<p>"That... that's none of your business!"<p>"This whole revenge kick, living as a guy, and making Ranma's life miserable had nothing to do with your family honor, did it?" Nabiki's face hardened at the silence, "DID IT?"<p>"HE STOLE MY DOWERY!"<p>"Your father got it back, three days later," Nabiki countered, "It was empty, but he got it back. The insurance he had on it even covered the lost food, and then some. I was surprised to find this out, when I had contacted Mr. Kuonji in order to compensate for loss. He was still ticked at Genma, though I don't blame him for that, but everything else... I have a feeling that him and the rest of your family have nothing to do with."<p>"I.. I..."<p>Nabiki took a bite of the food, nodding in satisfaction. She swallowed, before speaking again, "That got me to thinking, though it didn't take me long to come to a conclusion. Truthfully, the only thing that kept me from just acknowledging it was that I was blinded by my own interests in Ranma... you really did want more from him, didn't you?"<p>Ukyo's eyes narrowed, "What more would I want from that obnoxious jackass?"<p>"His attention, that's why you chased him for ten years. His approval, he was a training martial artist, so you trained just to be able to compete with him. His love... which you then found out you couldn't get that, then you settled for being petty."<p>"You think it's that simple?"<p>"I think so," Nabiki replied, "This whole thing started... because you were jealous. You didn't have a chance with him, so you settled for making him miserable. Well, congradulations in your successful effort."<p>"IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT!" Ukyo proclaimed, finding the theory the other woman proposed more than a little hurtful.<p>Nabiki shrugged, "it might not be, but until you can prove it, that's the most likely scenario. Can I get a carry out container?"<p>"What? Oh..." Ukyo reached under the counter, and pulled out a cardboard container, handing to Nabiki, "Sounds like you already have your mind made up, Ms. Tendou, so how am I supposed to prove it?"<p>"How about forgiving him, and moving on?"<p>"What makes you think I haven't already done all that?"<p>"I don't see any evidence to prove that you have," Nabiki stated, factually, "You know? Kaoru does miss his friend."<p>"Well, if he can track down Ranma-"<p>"I mean you, Ukyo," Nabiki interjected, "and, truth be told, he's a pretty good guy, you know, for a girl to get to know better."<p>"What?"<p>Nabiki stood up, and pulled out her wallet. Ukyo merely shook her head, and held her hand up. Not against turning down a free meal, Nabiki shrugged, and put her wallet away, "Just a suggestion. I mean, you could do worse than a future doctor, you know?"<p>Ukyo rolled her eyes, "Being a bit presumptuous, aren't you?"<p>Nabiki gave Ukyo a genuine smirk, "Well, I only said it was a suggestion. But Ukyo... Ranma isn't the only thing in life, no matter how we wanted him to be the only thing in our lives... take care." With that, Nabiki left.<p>_<p>One week.<p>Sunday rolled around, with not a word from Ranma. Nabiki still couldn't help but hurt at his absence, or his lack of contact, but after her talk with Ukyo, she understood how to move past it.<p>This time, the loss wasn't like the overwhelming tide of betrayal, despair, and abuse that she held at one time, but a sad, wistful, and sorrowful pang of emptiness that didn't consume, but reminded her of what she had recently discovered and had slipped away from her. This time, the pain wasn't devestating, but almost sweet in its sensation.<p>It was funny, though Ranma was decades her younger, it felt as if she had grown up because of him. She knew love now; not simply endearment, security, want, or even lust, but love for someone who was oh so more than a friend, a compatriot, and a lover. Ranma was everything she needed, and far exceeding what she could ever expect. In the week of contemplation and reverie, Nabiki had lost the weary facade of one who had been through too much; a shell that had consumed the confident, easy going person she once was. Now, a new strength was left in its stead; a quiet confidence from experience rather than nonchilance, a reserve that contradicted her comfortable indulgence, a grace that replaced her casual languishness, and a culture that stood in place of her past lavishness. Ranma most assuradly did not leave her a broken woman who would have to struggle to rebuild herself, he had in fact showed her a path in his own sacrifice. With Ranma's selflessness, he ensured that Nabiki grew as a person.<p>The irony of it all, Ranma even proved her wrong... dead wrong...<p>_<p>_<p>"Ranma... what we have, I... it's not love. At least not yet."<p>"Then what would you call it?"<p>"Like I said Ranma, I know we do care a great deal for each other, but there are a few things that need to be added to the equation."<p>"Yeah...?"<p>Ranma, what... do you need me? I mean, do you honestly feel that your life now won't stray far from mine?"<p>"Uh... yes?"<p>"Ranma, thank you, but I think we've got a long way to go, before we both can really believe that."<p>_<p>_<p>If there was one lesson Ranma managed to instill upon her, it was that love wasn't reliant on one another's dependance. The strength he had shown her, she added to her own, and the strength she had, and had gained, she returned to him. Even with such an exchange, she thought wryly, that she didn't necessarily need him, but she wanted him back so dearly that she ached.<p>She loved him, there was no escaping that, but she was still an individual. Someone who had a life before Ranma, and can continue to have a life without him. Ranma was an individual who could go on with or without her.<p>What they had together, would never be lost.<p>_<p>"Come in," Doctor Tofu called out, already expecting the visitor that entered the examination room he was prepping. He turned to acknowledge her presence, and couldn't help but smile. "My, you're obviously doing better."<p>Nabiki nodded subtly, favoring the doctor with a subdued, but still warm smile, "I am, thank you."<p>Tofu now didn't relish the question he was about to ask, but he knew it was prudent for him to do so, before anything else, "Then... I take it you've gotten over Ranma?"<p>Sitting in one of the chairs left in the small medical room, Nabiki closed her eyes, and shook her head, "I don't think I'll ever simply get over him, Tofu. I miss him."<p>With a deep breath and sigh, the doctor nodded in satisfaction. "You've changed."<p>"Things are a bit different in perspective, that's all," Nabiki responded, crossing her legs.<p>"I guess you can figure out the reason I asked for your presence this morning," Tofu enquired, moving things along.<p>"Same thing people have been wanting to talk to me about all week," Nabiki responded, almost casually, yet reserved, "Ranma."<p>"You know the reasons he left, right?" Tofu enquired, "It wasn't because of Akane, you realize?"<p>The middle aged woman tilted her head slightly, "How would you know?" Inside, she squelched the anger that was attempting to grow from her suspicion, but her mood still soured.<p>Assured that it was now best to get to the point, Tofu reached into his gi, and handed Nabiki a folded letter. Blinking in surprise, she accepted it, unfolding it almost unbearingly slow, even for her own liking.<p>'Hi, Nabiki'<p>The middle aged woman looked up at Tofu, who only stared back at her with his most professional expression, "Don't worry, what's in that letter stays between us three." Nabiki went back to reading, almost elated at the first contact Ranma had made with her in days.<p>'I hope you're doing okay. I<p>didn't mean to run out on you like<p>that, no, I guess I did, but not<p>like you're thinking, if you're<p>thinking I did it to hurt you or<p>something...'<p>"No, Ranma, I didn't think you did it to hurt me," Nabiki whispered, breaking into a ghost of a smile reminiscent of her old self.<p>'I just wanted to say, that<p>what I did was the hardest thing<p>I ever had to do, but I really<p>had to do it. Don't get me wrong,<p>it wasn't your fault, I just<p>couldn't stand hurting you any<p>more than I figured out I was.'<p>'Your sister was right<p>about some things, but she didn't<p>need to tell me anything. I<p>hate telling you this, I really<p>do, but I think we need some<p>time apart, to think about<p>things. Both of us got too deep<p>in things without thinking<p>about them first. I hope this<p>doesn't sound like I'm breaking<p>up with you, because that isn't<p>it at all. I love you, I really<p>do, Nabiki, and just thinking<p>that I MIGHT do something to<p>hurt you makes me crazy.'<p>'I'm not leaving you, you<p>got that? I'm coming back, no<p>matter what your sisters say,<p>or anyone thinks. I've been<p>talking with a few people,<p>and...'<p>Nabiki looked up at her former brother-in-law with a questioning glance. Tofu had helped Ranma write the letter, and could presume what Nabiki was silently enquiring about. He nodded in confirmation, then gestured for her to finish reading.<p>'I had a lot to sort<p>out. I think the biggest thing<p>I was worried about, was<p>leaving you alone. The doc<p>gave me an idea, and... I'm<p>not against it. I hope you<p>don't freak out or nothing,<p>and he said you would<p>understand it, so I guess<p>what happens next is up<p>to you.'<p>'I promise I won't<p>be gone long, and I'll be<p>keeping in touch with you.<p>Please don't tell my Pops,<p>because the vacation I had<p>from him still wasn't long<p>enough. So, I guess I'll<p>see you around. No I won't,<p>well, whatever. I love you,<p>Nabiki, I guess that's the<p>best way to finish this up.'<p>'P.S. I needed some<p>inspiration, as the Doc put<p>it, and I didn't feel<p>comfortable with anything<p>else. So, I hope you're not<p>angry, and if you are, don't<p>take it out on Happosai or<p>Shampoo, okay? Ask the Doc,<p>he knows what to do next.'<p>"So... 'Doc'," Nabiki asked, as wryly as she could manage, even with her eyes tearing up and her voice threatening to crack, "Ranma says you know what to do next?"<p>Tofu grinned a bit nervously, and pulled out a manilla envelope, handing it to Nabiki. Just as Ranma had instructed him, he placed himself near the closest exit, in case he needed to make a quick escape, just as Ranma warned him that if he looked at the envelope's contents, the pigtailed martial artist wouldn't be happy about it, either. Recalling the fight between Ranma and Akane, Tofu decided ignorance was the healthiest course.<p>Nabiki upended the envelope, finding photos almost ready to fall from it. Carefully, she removed them, and flipped them over. Her curious expression turned into a frown, and deepened at each image she looked at. One of her changing into her pajammas. One with her sleeping on the covers; the nights temperature making it unbearable to remain under them, or within her pajamma bottoms. An image of Nabiki answering a question about bras for Shampoo. The peculiar camera angle allowing Nabiki to estimate the camera was being held just out of her sight. Happosai giving a 'victory' symbol with his fingers, as he took a picture of himself as Nabiki walked across her room in order to get to her underwear drawer. A picture of Nabiki shaving in the shower...<p>Tofu understood the prudence of Ranma's warning, as he edged towards the door, making a step the deeper crimson Nabiki's face grew. Finally, when it seemed like she was about to burst, Tofu bolted.<p>"THAT JERK BETTER HAVE KEPT DUPLICATES!"<p>Tofu groaned, realizing he was now going to have to replace the pair of glasses he broke between the floor and his face.<p>_<p>_<p>Epilogue<p>_<p>_<p>Ranma huffed, looking around the neighborhood. He didn't think he would be gone this long, but he knew that it would all be worth it in just a few moments. His backpack shifted slightly; it's gruesome wieght barely providing any exertion to him, considering his training.<p>The sun was blocked by heavy overcast that threatened to erupt into a downpour at any moment, in turn igniting his curse, and he felt more than a little weary from his trek. Still, he felt that the day couldn't be any finer than any day of his twenty-one years of life.<p>Before he realized it, he arrived. The imported glossy off-white Audi A8 sat in the driveway, announcing the residents were most likely home. Nervously, Ranma walked up to the door, and rang the doorbell. He fiddled with his hands, almost over-axiously anticipating the answering of the door.<p>He nearly jumped, as the door was thrust open. He blinked, before adjusting his line of sight, to find a little girl looking up at him expectantly. He smiled at her adorable slate gray eyes, and shoulder cropped hair, not imagining a more beautiful lookin child. "Hey, squirt."<p>After a few moments, the girl broke into a smile, before a voice behind her interrupted the two of them. "Jessica, I keep telling you about answering the door, let Momm-..."<p>Ranma couldn't help it, she still made him breathless. Behind those deep mohogany irises, he drank in the warming emotions that came with her realization; those delicious, vibrant, enriching emotions that he couldn't help but wrap himself in like the most comfortable, secure blanket he had ever known.<p>Ceasing with the fiddling of his hands, and leaving the wedding band alone, Ranma smiled, as Nabiki smiled back.<p>Fin.<p>_<p>_<p>WFROSE: YES! FINISHED! I HAVE FINALLY CONQUERED THIS INSANELY LONG AND IRRITATING BEAST OF A STORY, AND I CAN GET ON WITH MY LIFE!<p>Ah... I mean, the ending's swell and all... but what about me?<p>WFROSE: What about you?<p>Not to seem ungrateful for once not making me an ass or anything...<p>Yeah, you did make him rather out of character.<p>Hush, you. I mean, it was all about Nabiki.<p>So the chapter was perfect, what are you trying to complain about Ranma-kun?<p>Well, it still isn't complete until Ranma-honey gets his point of view, you know, Sugar?<p>WFROSE: Tai-food, yes, I'm definitely in the mood for Tai-<p>THE HELL YOU'RE LEAVING THIS ROOM!<p>Even if you made me an unreasonable psychobitch from hell...<p>WFROSE: Well, I thought you would get tired of always being a two-dimensional backdrop that constantly utters 'oh my' at necessary intervals. I wanted to make you more interesting...<p>Oh my, I guess I'll simply go with your idea, Ukyo. Could you hand me a cattle-prod, please? and Froze...<p>WFROSE: Um, that's pronounced 'WFROSE'.<p>I think all of us would...<p>::ZACKT::<p>...appreciate if you gave poor Ranma his say.<p>You got that right, sugar. We won't have another 'Akane the Suicidal' fiasco...<p>Hey, these things are pretty nifty...<p>Jerk, these aren't toys...<p>WFROSE: Ah... I guess fooding up can wait?<p>::all nods::
