</div>'Older'<p>Nabiki had forgiven Shampoo, but she would be damned to forget, or suspect. The middle aged woman didn't completely believe Shampoo's story, just the fact that the young Amazon was sincere in her apology. Shampoo was trying to keep the status of things vague, just in case she had been backed into a thick brick wall by her own laws and customs. Though Nabiki did sympathize with her, empathy was lacking. Though Nabiki prayed it wouldn't coe, if at the moment Shampoo made a move on Ranma, a genuine one, Nabiki would let Shampoo know that on no certain grounds that the two of them were enemies.<p>Nabiki was loathe to think such, but she decided it wasn't worth taking things for granted. She may have put a great deal of trust in the young Chinese native she cared to consider a friend, but prudence demanded her vigilance. As well as that, though she seriously doubted any wavering on Ranma's part of whom he remained interested in, Nabiki felt it best to reaffirm her position.<p>Nabiki approached Ranma and Happosai's room, and found the Grand Master of her martial arts school, happily ironing his booty from the previous evening, "Granpa, mind if I talk with you a bit?"<p>"You needed something, Nabiki dear?" the old master replied. Nabiki had forgone the speech over the new additions to his collection, and enqired his time, which immidiately tipped him off that she had a rather important request to make.<p>Nabiki suspected that the conversation would head directly to the point, she lost some of her perpetual good natured cheer, replacing it with a bit of seriousness, "I know you've been intentionally keeping Shampoo and Cologne out of me and Ranma's hair."<p>"Am I that transparent?" Happosai asked, not sounding at all as if he was impressed or concerned by Nabiki's accusation, and continued to concentrate on completing his work on the additions to his silky darling collection.<p>Nabiki smirked, "Well, I know for a fact Ranma has no idea, and I only can guess Cologne has a hint of an idea, while Shampoo probably finds thinking when it comes to you difficult through her all consuming rage."<p>"And you were able to deduuce this by...?"<p>Happosai was just favoring Nabiki with small talk, allowing her to gather her wits to ask what she needed to, "I've known you since I was a little girl, since before Daddy and Genma Saotome attempted to bury you alive. I think I can be credited with knowing a few things about you and how you work."<p>"I suppose," Happosai replied, still remaining undaunted.<p>Nabiki settled onto the floor in lotus position, and started again, before one article caught Nabiki's attention, enticing her to pick it up, albeit gingerly between her index and forefinger, while studying it with a speclative expression.<p>"You can have that one if you want. Happosai stated, pulling another pair of panties from the pile in the middle of the floor.<p>Nabiki's nose twisted up in distain, "No thank you, I have no interest in wearing another woman's undergarments..."<p>"They've never been worn before," Happosai countered, gently smoothing out the wrinkles in the pink and yellow pair that currently harvested the majority of his concentration.<p>Nabiki groaned, realizing what was implied; it wasn't any better if it was stolen from a store or another woman, but still, "Happosai..."<p>"Feh," Happosai snorted. He knew this conversation had to come at some point during their tradeoff, "I doubt the fools around here could even suspect to point fingers here. Now, you had something to ask?"<p>Nabiki's smile returned, a hule one, "I... Ranma won't have school tomorrow,so I was considering taking him out tonight."<p>"And you want it to just be the two of you, huh?" Now, Happosai stopped working on his hobby, giving Nabiki his full attention.<p>The knowing smirk on Happosai's face was confirmation enough that he was following along, though Nabiki continued to explain, "I have a feeling more than a couple of people might miss us, if you know what I mean."<p>"You know that it's rather cruel of you to sick your ol' Granpa on Shampoo, right?"<p>Nabiki smiled a little more, "Please, be gentle with her."<p>Happosai had to cackle at that, "Nabiki dear, your sister Akane may have the skills over you, but you're the one that took most to my teachings!"<p>"I suspect that was *supposed* to be a compliment," the middle aged woman replied, not sure how to take the comparison.<p>Happosai went back to his personally therapeutic work, "It's about time you really started to treat the boy like something special."<p>"Ranma is special to me," Nabiki said in her most serious tone, though the teeniest bit subdued. The expression in her eyes dulled, yet sparkled, as if she found both humility and contentment in her adimant statement.<p>Happosai paused from ironing for a few moments to study Nabiki, before beginning his work again, "Does he know that?" He picked up the panties he was working on, and meticulously expected them, "and more important, do *you* really understand that?"<p>"Happosai, I-"<p>"What happened to 'Granpa'?" Happosai enquired.<p>Nabiki sighed at the interruption, "Granpa, I'm hardly some little lovesick teenager who-"<p>"That's not what I'm asking, Nabiki."<p>The dead seriousness in her master's voice put her off for a moment; she had almost missed it since he chose to continue working on the pile next to them. With a deep breath, Nabiki started again, "Yes... yes he mean a lot to me, probably too much more than he should for his welfare. Maybe it was inevitable, this probably happened because I'm a miserable, lonely woman who never realized how isolated I'd been from my emotions!"<p>"Being a little hard on yourself, don't you think?"<p>Nabiki stood up, and walked to the window, "No... I don't know. It was funny, Before I even met Ranma, I didn't think anything of this." Nabiki shrugged, "i was happy with everything I had; a successful job, good friends, a good though estranged family... then this boy comes around, acting like a little jerk and getting on all my last nerves, while still being the sweetest thing. Now that I think about it, it does sound like I was a little more than desperate."<p>Happosai grumbled, ceasing in his tasks once again, "More like foolish."<p>"What?"<p>"Nabiki dear, if you really care for the little punk, you're going to have to look at him more than some 'snot-nosed little puke who managed to get lucky with an older woman'."<p>Nabiki wanted to argue against it, since she far from agreed with the ancient martial artist's theory on her perspective of Ranma, but decided to hear him out, "Is that so?"<p>"You keep treating him like some undeserving kid, he treats you like a dainty old woman, neither of you guys consider yourself equals, do you?"<p>"Well, we're not exactly 'peers' here," Nabiki said, sardonically.<p>"That aint my point, child. If he's old enough for you to have feeling for other than matronly, then he's more than your equals. Try thinking about that instead of how young his is, it'll do the both of you a bit of good."<p>"You make it sound so easy," Nabiki challenged, irritated that he seemed to be taking her feelings on the matter rather condesindingly.<p>"I've been practicing the art all my life, girl," Happosai countered, "I was learned to perfectly read body language of my opponents by the time I was around thirty. Same can be said about emotions. There's only so many ways a person can move, Nabiki. And at the moment, there's only two directions you and Ranma can go with this, up..." Happosai pointed into the air, "or down," he pointed to the ground.<p>"Well, then what about Ranma? You're saying he has the same problem?" Nabiki asked, still unnamused with Happosai's assessment, but nonetheless intrigued.<p>"Heh, he's a little easier to pinpoint. Boy's head over heels in love with you, that much is obvious," the eldery pervert proclaimed, "Problem is he gots some weird idea that if he even glances at you the wrong way, he's gonna break you."<p>"This isn't just about when you asked us to spar the other day, is it?" Nabiki asked, figuring that it had something to do with things.<p>"That's just part of it. The boy's afraid of you, and not for his physical welfare, either. Almost like he's been trying so damned hard for you to notice him, and now that you do, he thinks the slightest wrong move is going to destroy things between you."<p>"As much as he likes to tease me, I hardly think that's accurate." Nabiki countered, finding a hole in Happosai's rational.<p>"Feh, knowing that idiot Genma, Ranma's probably got it instilled that direct insults don't have a lasting affect on people. I'm pretty sure you figured it out by now, too. You've always been a bright girl."<p>Nabiki sighed in resignation, "So, then what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to improve this supposed perilous situation between me and Ranma?"<p>Happosai smirked, "You still have that box under your bed..."<p>"NO... I mean... I sincerly doubt he's ready for that," Nabiki stated quickly, before thinking to herself, "Or if I am, really."<p>Happosai's grin got deeper, almost as if he had heard Nabiki's afterthought, "All you gotta do, is just show the boy a good time tonight. Don't be afraid to do anything any normal couple wouldn't mind doing with one another. I'm hardly an expert psychologist, but I can tell you it will probably work better than any formal treatment you were probably thinking of lavishing him with."<p>Happosai returned to his ironing, "If you're planning on making the miserable snot a part of your world, you may as well show him what it's all about. Don't worry about Shampoo or the old ghoul's interferance."<p>With a subdued smile and nod, Nabiki walked over to Happosai, bent down, and kissed him on the cheek, "You know, Granpa, even if you're a letcherous, infuriating, pain in the ass, you're a pretty sweet guy."<p>"Feh," Happosai countered, "There's no need for all that, when a simple hug to your bosom would be more than enough gratitude!"<p>They both moved before Nabiki even fully realized what Happosai had said, and was already sidestepping and backfisting the old pervert through the window, and out over several houses. Blinking, Nabiki took a moment to realize what she did, before groaning in irritation, "Damn it, not the window!"<p>_<p>Ranma nervously entered, a bit disturbed by the way Shampoo had nearly attached herself to his side since she had intercepted him on the rooftops. He wondered exactly how she knew he wasn't going to take the bus from school this time, since she didn't even go to the same school he did.<p>"We're home," Ranma announced, before being taken aback slightly; home... that sounded about right, didn't it?<p>"SWEETO!"<p>Any nervousness Ranma felt mangified, as he heard the old letch's favored battlecry. Before the pigtailed boy could give any exclamation himself, he immidiately went into defensive, expecting a splash of water from any direction, followed by the all too familiar, yet very unwelcome sensation to his cursed form's torso.<p>As fortune would have it, the indignant female cry came from beside him.<p>Ranma just barely managed to duck Shampoo's flailing arms, as she began to frantically shake herself, before attempting to pry the old pervert from her chest. Ranma prepared himself for assistance, before he felt a hand on his shoulder. "Huh, Nabiki?"<p>The woman in question watched Shampoo hysterically run through the house with an apologetic expression on her face, before turning her serious expression towards the young man, "Ranma, do you mind if we go to your room for a talk?"<p>"Uh, but what about..." Ranma simply pointed to the bloodlusting Amazon carrying two foot long daggers, swinging almost indescriminately at Happosai.<p>The ancient martial artist cackled, as he rubbed the bra he had appropriated from Shampoo against his cheek, "My, lacy! So unlike you Shampoo dear! You trying to impress someone, perhaps?" Shampoo simply answered with a left swing, spinning into a right backhanded swing, followed by a rising right ax kick.<p>"Shampoo can take care of herself," Nabiki replied to Ranma's inquiery.<p>"I was more concerned about the furniture damage," Ranma stated in a dry tone.<p>Nabiki seemed to have missed his wry humor, "I'll just replace anything that's damaged, can we please go to your room? I really would like to talk to you in private."<p>The slight urgency and seriousness in Nabiki's voice left Ranma a little guarded, but he complied, and led the older woman to the room he and Happosai shared. Ranma turned around, just in time to see Nabiki close the door gently.<p>"Sup?" Ranma asked casually, before noticing something *very* peculiar. Nabiki was clutching her elbows rather tightly with her hands, and seeming to study the room. The whole time, it was almost like she was trying not to look directly at him.<p>"You and Happosai keep it pretty spartan in here," Nabiki finally commented after several moments.<p>Ranma shrugged, not really seeing where this was leading. Nabiki had been in there many times before, and she never mentioned it, "Yah, well I don't really need a lot of stuff, you know?"<p>"If you want, I could, well, have a bed ordered for you... how about a TV up here?"<p>Ranma blinked slowly, "I'm... fine with what I have, but thanks for the offer."<p>"How come you, you don't hang any posters up or anything. Maybe some martial arts ones or something."<p>Ranma frowned, but only slightly, "I didn't think you came up here to discuss decour."<p>Nabiki smiled slightly, "I guess not, huh?"<p>It was then that Ranma figured it out, rather shocked at the revelation; Nabiki was actually *nervous*! That thought was enough to set off distress alarms, "Nabiki, is something wrong?"<p>"No... no, nothing's wrong," Nabiki replied, before taking a deep breath, "I just wanted to ask you something important."<p>"Well, shoot, it isn't like I'll say no... uh... depending, I mean."<p>"No, I don't think you would say no, Ranma," Nabiki replied, almost whispering to herself, before almost seeming to take the effort to focus only on the pigtailed boy, "Ranma, I kind of... planned a special night for the two of us. I was wondering if you would like to join me out and about tonight?"<p>Ranma double blinked, "Sure, is that all?"<p>Nabiki quickly experienced relief, followed by a slight irritation, "What do you mean, 'is that all'?"<p>"The way you were fidgeting, I figured you were going to ask me how I felt about Shampoo or something."<p>Nabiki was surprised at Ranma speculation, "And..."<p>Ranma rolled his eyes and sighed, as if he was tired of the issue in the first place. Instead of answering verbally, he stepped up to Nabiki, wrapped his arms around her ribs, and leaned forward for a kiss. Nabiki had to close her eyes, and almost moaned into the sensation of Ranma's lips against hers; he was definitely getting better with coming up with the correct replies.<p>Ranma smirked as he pulled away, still seeing Nabiki's eyes closed; oh yeah, he was a man among men, alright. "We kissed plenty of times, you asked me to go on vacation with you, and you get nervous over asking me out on a date?"<p>Nabiki would have found that same observation obsurd, but for some reason, this felt much more... more... urgent, like there was a lot more riding on the line tonight. "I guess," Nabiki replied in wry humor, "Sorry to have you going like that. Though, you do realize that *I'm* paying for everything? I'm the one taking you out, understand?"<p>"Huh?" Ranma replied, not quite understanding where she was coming from.<p>"What I'm saying, Ranma-hon, is I don't want to hear any complaints the whole night, or anytime after about my lavishing wealth on you."<p>Ranma's smirk became a bit more subdued, "Ah, I told you you don't need to spend a lot of money on me or anything, I'm-"<p>"But I WANT to, Ranma," Nabiki interjected, pressing herself against the pigtailed boy, while rubbing her thigh against the outside of his leg. To his credit, Ranma didn't stagger backwards, though the motion did unnerve him somewhat. The middle-aged woman smiled at his reaction, "What good is having well off, if you have no reason to spend it?"<p>"Well, there are other reasons you can use it for," Ranma attempted to counter, while knowing the admittantly smarter older woman would blow through his defense.<p>"Ranma Saotome, *YOU'RE* the best reason I have," Nabiki stated adimantly. Ranma couldn't reply, as he was too concentrated on repeating to himself that men don't go weak in the knees. It was becoming a losing battle as he continued to stare at Nabiki's firm and serious expression.<p>Nabiki finally broke away from her embrace with Ranma, and walked to the window, looking out into the darkening and dwindling day, "I... I think there are a lot of things I want to discuss with you, some very serious things, Ranma. Things that we should probably get out in the open before any further decisions between us can be made."<p>"Uh, this *is* just a date, right?" Ranma enquired, wondering why Nabiki was being so serious about this.<p>Nabiki brushed the hair on the left side of her face, imagining a few strands out of place. For several, quiet but intense moments, Ranma began to admire Nabiki's posture in front of the window, as she looked out into the coming night. He could almost imagine some wind catching her clothes, blowing her thin fabriced pants and longsleeved blouse, while dancing through her perfectly cut hair. It was almost amazing to him, how she could look so desireable, so beautiful without even trying.<p>"Yes... just a date," Nabiki replied, breaking Ranma out of his spell. With a subdued smile, Nabiki turned back to Ranma, "We can leave in a couple of hours, I'll let you get ready, then. Meet me down the street at the bus stop at seven. Wear something nice, but comfortable." With that, Nabiki walked by him, kissing the boy on the cheek before she left the room.<p>Still somewhat in a daze, Ranma walked to his closet, opened the door, and snapped back to reality. Inside of it was packed with clothing Nabiki and Shampoo had picked out for him during their vacation. This had been the first time since they had loaded everything in, that he realized exactly how much the got him.<p>With a groan of fustration, he took a dress shirt out, looking at it on the hanger, "Great, so what am I gonna wear?"<p>_<p>Nabiki stood, wearing a formal, yet almost business-like dark earthen brown suit with skirt. As far as she could recall, it would be the first time Ranma had seen her in a skirt, and hoped the affect would be surprising for him. The previous bus had left by about ten minutes prior, leaving no one but her present. Checking her watch, Ranma had two minutes; she doubted she would be stood up, but the wait still made her more than a little flustered.<p>Almost too quiet for her hearing, Ranma landed behind her, "Hey, been wait'n long?"<p>Nabiki still jumped, "Ranma! Did you... did you...?"<p>"Did I what?" Ranma equired, staring owlishly at Nabiki, when she turned around to him, startled. He took in her outfit, and managed to smile, awkwardly, "Ah... you look nice."<p>Nabiki had no such comments, as her own tongue wasn't up to it's usual facilitations. Ranma was wearing the black Ralph Lauren Polo shirt she had picked out for him, more as a bad pun than anything, and completed it with stone grey dress pants, and black suede shoes and black socks. She would have said something about the black cloth bracers he was wearing, but they seemed almost appropriate on  hair actually seemed behaved, brushed back neatly, while he still kept his pigtail. He had already explained the necessity of it to her, but she still would have liked to see it out in a ponytail.<p>It wasn't so much the outfit that gave Nabiki pause, but seeing Ranma in a different ensemble than he usually wore. Unlike the dragon hensley shirt, this outfit gave Ranma a more domesticated look, while being powerfully sensible and mature. Exactly the type of outfit she would have expected a man she was interested in to be wearing.<p>"Um..." Ranma broke Nabiki's reverie, while fidgeting, "this look alright to you?"<p>"Y-yes, you look great, Ranma," Nabiki responded, gathering her usual confidence once more, "So, are you ready for a night on the town?"<p>"Heh, you bet... but why aren't we taking your car? I saw it back in the driveway."<p>"I would rather not tonight," Nabiki replied, her reasons being she didn't want to tip Shampoo off, lest it did manage to get back to her Great-Grandmother. "We should be fine with the Subways tonight."<p>"So we're waiting for the bus?" Ranma asked, knowing they were in for a little wait if they were.<p>Nabiki smirked impishly, pointing to the sneakers on her feet, "I have my heels in my bag here," she then pointed to the large purse she was carrying, "We both can get to the subway faster than the bus would, anyways."<p>"Uh, well," Ranma was sure he could, at least. It was then that Nabiki leapt onto the bus stop shelter, and then leaped onto a nearby building. Ranma stared after her, before smirking, and joined her.<p>_<p>Ranma had no problem keeping up with Nabiki, yet he allowed her the lead instead of catching up next to her. It was a pleasant surprise, though he suspected she was capable of it, he had pretty much thought it was a bit below her. Yet, there she was, only a few meters away, in an attractive brown skirt that came to stop just above her knees, and women's sports jacket that spoke of her inner confidence and femeninity. The white tennis shoes stood out, but they weren't permenant for the attire, while what completed her outfit were the nearly matching brown pantihose that lead up to...<p>Nabiki looked back, as she heard Ranma yelp. She saw him, pulling himself up from a ledge he should have leapt from. stopping, Nabiki headed back, "Ranma, you okay?"<p>"Ah... just got distracted," The pigtailed young man replied with an awkward smile. With a flourish, he launched himself from the wall of the ledge he was hanging against, back-flipping to land before Nabiki.<p>Nabiki smirked, "Well, if you're done screwing around, we have a ways to go, and then the rest of the way by subway. We don't want to diturb too many people with our chenanigans, plus it's a bit difficult to do this with skyscrapers in the way."<p>"I bet we can do it," Ranma challenged confidently.<p>"But.. .we're not," Nabiki replied firmly, but with a mirthful smile, "Let's get going, shall we?"<p>Ranma ran alongside Nabiki this time, dividing his attention between keeping his footing, and watching Nabiki. She was certainly concentrating on the task at hand, and he could see her breathing was slightly heavier, even if she was trying to hide it. Hesitatingly, Ranma focused on their traveling, lest he once again find himself in a foolish position.<p>Nabiki spotted the office building she was looking for as her landmark, before turning to Ranma, "This way." With that, she leapt down to street level into an alley, rebounding off the two side walls until she was at the ground. She quickly strode into the open walkway, before turning in the direction of their destination. She went ahead and started walking, just as Ranma caught up with her.<p>With a pleasant smile, she motioned him to the underground entrance to the subway, and only fifteen minutes later, were they both heading deeper into Tokyo via underground. "Nabiki..."<p>"Hm?" the older woman turned to look at him expectantly, though it was obvious she was a bit distracted.<p>"Ah... you're okay with this... I mean being out with someone... my age, right?"<p>Nabiki chuckled, and ruffled Ranma's hair, before kissing him on the cheek affectionately. Ranma's eyes widened, before he quickly scanned the train compartment, expecting to have to defend Nabiki's actions. Further to his surprise, he was met with disinterest, or with others, smiles. He wasn't a fool to believe that his relationship with Nabiki was commonplace, so he was more than a little confused at the reactions.<p>Nabiki stiffled another set of chuckles, before leaning over to whisper in Ranma's ear, "Ranma-hon, to them, it's nothing more than a young man showing his 'old woman' a night on the town, alright?" Ranma was still a bit fuzzed on things, but silently nodded, while smoothing his hair back in place.<p>"Here's our stop," Nabiki announced, just as the train announcer stated it.<p>_<p>Nabiki pointed to their destination, "Well, that's our first stop tonight, I'm pretty sure you'll find it to your satisfaction."<p>Ranma followed Nabiki's finger, before he froze, "Uh... there?"<p>"Yes, there," Nabiki stated, " They just opened up here not too long ago, and thought it would be a good place for the both of us to check out. I hope you're hungry, Ranma-hon." Holding her arm out, Nabiki looked at Ranma expectantly, "So, shall we?"<p>Ranma dumbly nodded, as he hooked his arm into Nabiki, and allowed her to pull him into 'Fogo de Chao'. He wasn't sure what to expect, but from the large assortment of meats they had rotating on skewers in the front window, he had a sneaking suspicion he would be more than happy with the restaurant selection.<p>Shortly, they were seated at a booth that had been secluded in one of the corners. It was by Nabiki's request, as it would allow them to sit next to each other without too many peculiar glances. The waiter had come by and explained how things worked, and the purpose of the circular markers were for.<p>"Uh... explain that again?"<p>"Thank you," Nabiki interjected, dismissing the waiter, before turning to Ranma, "Just leave the red side up until you're full."<p>"Oh," with that, Ranma turned the red side up.<p>"Rack of lamb, sir?"<p>"EYAH!" Ranma nearly jumped from the booth at the seemingly sudden appearance of a man in what looked like a swashbuckler's outfit, sans the fancy pirates hat, sword, and gloves. He hadn't even seen him approach.<p>"I'll be back, Ranma, I' going to start with the salad bar." Nabiki got up from the booth, and approached the two large and exorbantly lavish salad bars in the center of the restaurant. While Ranma was distracted, she thought it would be a good time to get her thoughts together. What she wanted to talk about wasn't going to be simple, and potentially could make or break any relationship at the very height of times. Not that Nabiki was nervous or anything, oh no, not at all.<p>Fifteen minutes later, she returned from the salad bar with only a few leaves of lettuce.<p>"More Chicken wrapped in bacon, sir?"<p>"Would you like some prime rib?"<p>"Here is some more roasted pork,sir."<p>"I have the steak you requested."<p>Ranma looked at the four waiters standing over him, before nodding happily; he didn't know what a 'goucho' was, but he liked the way they cooked! The waiters parted to allow Nabiki to sit back down, while Ranma continued to devour his meal at a somewhat sensible rate; no reason to throw it down his throat, since his father wasn't around, and it did his tastebuds justice to savor the juicy meats.<p>"I trust you're enjoying yourself?" Nabiki enquired, internally attempting to steel herself.<p>"I haveta admit, you couldn't have picked it better, Nabiki, thanks!"<p>"Here, use some of my wine to wash it down," Nabiki offered, handing him her still full wineglass. Ranma looked at it, a bit puzzled that Nabiki was offering, before accepting it, and only taking a few sips. He then chased it down with half of his glass of water.<p>"Ranma, can I ask you something?"<p>"Uh, you said you had something you wanted to talk about, right?" Ranma asked, just as a waiter came up and was about to offer him more meat<p>Nabiki turned Ranma's circular card face down so the brown was face up instead of the red, and shook her head politely to the waiter. Once he was gone, the middle aged woman gave Ranma her most serious look, "Ranma, what do you think you're going to be doing with your life? Do you plan on going to school or anything like that?"<p>Ranma flinched, not really expecting this conversation to come up, "Well, I dunno, really. I kinda always used to... well, wonder about becoming an action movie star or something when I was younger. Nowadays I never really thought about it, I guess."<p>Nabiki internally sighed. Like many kids today, it was rather unfortunate that they lacked any long-term goals. "Well, keep in mind my younger Sis is in the picture biz in the United States, so that option can be open to you if you like."<p>"Hmm, movies, dunno though," Ranma replied, taking another bite of his food.<p>Nabiki grabbed a fork, and stole a piece from Ranma's plate, earning a slightly indignant squawk from Ranma, but nothing further. "Anything else you can think of? There has to be something."<p>"Ah, not really," Ranma thought about it, not coming up with any other ideas.<p>"How about a martial arts instructor? Ever thought about that?"<p>Ranma's mouth turned south at the suggestion, but only slightly, "Na, never thought myself really to be a teacher or something. Could be Pop's teaching methods that soured me offa the idea."<p>"I can understand that," Nabiki retorted a bit sourly herself, "I guess that's something we may have to explore at a later time."<p>"Alright," Ranma replied, before reaching to flip his marker back over to let the feast begin again.<p>Nabiki's hand stopped his, that wasn't what she really wanted to ask him. "Ranma..." Looking back at her, Ranma was taken aback by the determined, yet vunerable expression Nabiki was wearing.<p>"Ranma," Nabiki began again, "Where do you see 'us'... in a few years?"<p>"Huh?" Ranma replied, the question throwing him completely for a loop.<p>"Five... ten, fifteen years down the line even," Nabiki began to explain, looking to the other patrons of the restuarant, being cater to by the ever diligent waiters, "What do you see in your future?"<p>"Uh... I dunno?" Ranma replied, a bit lost at the signifigance of the question.<p>Nabiki turned back to him with a hard glare that stated she wouldn't tolerate any such non-answers, "Ranma, this is important, I want you to answer this completely." Nabiki slumped back in her seat, attempting to allow some of her tension to deflate, "I'm asking this, because... because I want... I want..."<p>Nabiki folded her hands together over the top of the table, bowing her head with her eyes closed, "...commitment. I want to know that you're actually planning on staying around longer than a year or so, or when another girl catches your eye."<p>"There ain't going to be any other-"<p>"Yes. There. Will." Nabiki cut him off with such venom in her voice he almost chocked on the response she gave. Nabiki calmed down a bit, before continuing. "Ranma, I know you love me, but I'm also a bit more... experienced on these things." She favored him with a light smile, "But just because you find other women beautiful, doesn't mean you won't love me any less."<p>"O...kay." Ranma replied, silently glad she approved that he would be looking at other girls. It wasn't his fault that Shampoo was pretty attractive, after all.<p>"But I'm going to ask you again, and I want a straight answer, what do you see for us in the future? Do you even think we could last that long?"<p>With an exaggerated sigh, Ranma leaned over to kiss Nabiki, only to have her hand firmly pressed against his sternum, arresting his motion forward. "No bullshit this time, Ranma."<p>The pigtailed boy nearly baulked at her cold, almost angry glare, and didn't even realize, as usual, himself becoming defensive. His greatest flaw kicked in, as he began to spout the most unthinking, careless things he could.<p>"Heck! I don't know, okay? Maybe we'll be teaching the art together in your family dojo, maybe I will be some big movie star like Jet Li or Bruce Lee or Toshiro Mifune, when you ask your sister to help us out! We could probably have some kids that know both our schools and I'll end up teaching them. You asking me to predict the future or something? Because the only thing I know is that there's probably not going to be one without you in it! I mean with my old man demanding that I only practice martial arts, and we both know how loopy my Mom is, I doubt they've given it much more thought than I have! You're the only one who's even mentioned anything about it, and you don't seem any certain of the answer than I do! So how about we wait until we get to that five, ten, or fifteen year mark before deciding these things? The fact of the matter is, I *AIN'T* going anywhere without you, nor can I say I wanna, alright?" Ranma didn't even notice till after he was finished with his rant that Nabiki was in tears. "Wait! I didn't mean-"<p>Nabiki gave him a smile from glossy eyes and tear steaking cheeks that could only come from the deepest of the heart, stopping any reply the pigtailed boy could make cold. "Yes you did, Ranma... yes you did."<p>Nabiki reached across them both, and flipped Ranma's card over for him, "Enjoy yourself. I'm going to go freshen up for a second." With that, Nabiki quickly and urgently made her way to the bathroom. After her departure, Ranma was once again swarmed by attentive waiters. Unfortunately, he realized he also didn't have much of an appetite any more.<p>_<p>Ranma was growing extremely nervous, the longer Nabiki stayed quiet. Ever since they left the restaurant, Nabiki hadn't given him more than nods of confirmation or shakes of her head in negative. He knew he screwed up with his outburst back during dinner, but she was making it difficult for him to put it right. He was loathe to hurt her feelings again in any way, and her unnerving silence was eating away at him. "Are you sure you're okay?"<p>Nabiki nodded once again, not saying anything verbally. She had barely been able to look at Ranma for an extended period of time, instead choosing to seem as if she were simply navigating the both of them to their next destination. Truth be told, Nabiki couldn't trust herself to say anything. Even looking at Ranma was proving disruptive to her composure. It had taken her a great deal of time to get herself back in order before returning to Ranma at the restaurant, and that composure was proving to be extremely fragile.<p>She knew Ranma was becoming extremely agitated, and she dearly wanted to verbally console him. Instead, after his last question, and her nod of reply, she braved a smile of appreciation towards him, before placing her hand in the small of his back, and rubbing it slightly. She felt him relax under her hand, but knew he wasn't completely convinced. Their next destination, by the time they arrived, she hoped that she would have calmed down enough to explain herself, and possibly move things further.<p>"So, uh, where we heading?" Ranma enquired, hoping the question would get her to at least say something. Once again, Nabiki remained silent, but pointed into the distance towards one of the taller skyscrapers. It didn't clarify things any, which only helped to add to his fustration. With a sigh of resignation, Ranma decided to simply quietly follow Nabiki.<p>_<p>Ranma looked around, wondering why Nabiki brought him to a beer brewery. Granted, they were just on the skywalk; below them off to the side some sort of exibit. Ranma disregarded it, and obediently followed Nabiki into the towering building over them. She lead them both to an elevator, and patiently waited until one arrived. After allowing the exiting couple by, they both took the elevator up, both finding the low hum of the elevator almost as maddening as the silence between them. Nabiki stepped herself closer to Ranma, leaning against him; even if she wasn't quite ready to speak, she would at least give him comfort.<p>The elevator doors opened, and Nabiki took Ranma's hand, leading him out into the hall. Ranma still remained puzzled about the whole thing, but found his confusion pushed to the side at the view presented to him, when they both walked outside. Below them lay Tokyo, covered in a layer of lights that contrasted with the blanket of night. The sight was almost spellbinding, as Ranma quietly walked to the railing, looking over the city.<p>"Beautiful, isn't it?"<p>Ranma's slight trance was broken, as he nearly gave himself whiplash to turn to look at Nabiki. The middle aged woman stared wistfully out into the city, leaning against the rail. "I haven't been up here in a while, mainly because it loses something when you're not with someone up here."<p>"Oh," was all Ranma could say, inside doing somersaults at the fact that Nabiki was actually speaking to him again.<p>"Ranma... is there anything you want me to tell you?" Nabiki asked, almost too quietly.<p>Ranma looked around, finding only three other people on the roof with them of the Yesibu Sapporo corporate Tower. Their attention was elsewhere, and Ranma decided that he and Nabiki had enough privacy to themselves, "Ask you what?"<p>"You're not the first guy I've felt so strongly about, Ranma," Nabiki replied, still looking outward, "If we... if we both really want this to work, I think you should know everything."<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed. He recalled asking her about it once, and found the idea of Nabiki even being with someone else before him both hurt and angered him. Intellectually, he knew it was something neither of them could help, as if their own relationship had been something expected, but, well, the very idea still brought out his possessive urges.<p>She was willing to tell him everything. She was going to reveal her romantic past to Ranma, and explain to him who had come before him. His curiousity peaked heavily at her offer.<p>"No," Ranma replied, "What do I care if you were seeing some other jerk a while back?"<p>"Ranma..." Nabiki trailed off, looking towards the pigtailed boy.<p>Ranma favored her with a soft, comforting smile, "Well, he had to be a jerk to give up someone like you. I don't need to know what happened in ancient history, since I have you now."<p>Savoring the radiant glow Ranma's words infused in her, Nabiki turned fully towards him, and wrapped him in a hug, "Ranma, I'm s-sorry about tonight. I p-planned on everything being perfect between us, but... there's j-just too much that I... that I..."<p>Ranma returned the embrace, kissing Nabiki's trembling cheek, as she rested her head against his  his firm body against hers managed to somewhat abate her budding sobs, but the tears would not cease. "I'll say this once, and that's the last we're going to talk about it," Ranma stated, hugging Nabiki tighter, "I know you got history, and it's just something I haveta accept. Knowing it or not isn't gonna make a difference over the fact that I love you. Having some old boyfriend that I know nothing about isn't going to make me change my feelings on the matter. So no, I don't wanna know, because I don't care." Ranma smirked for her, even she couldn't see his face, "Besides, it was perfect the moment we went to that 'Fogo Te Chyao' place."<p>Nabiki began to tremble again, bringing Ranma's anxiety up once more. Before he could ask what the problem was now, pretty sure this time he didn't say anything that really should have set her off, Nabiki spoke with a voice tainted with sobs, and colored with humor. "You know," she started, pulling away slightly so Ranma could see her face, "Just over two months ago, I remember a cocky kid who used to stumble onto the wrong things to say at any given moment, and irritate the Hell out of me."<p>"Hey!" Ranma shouted, before Nabiki quickly place a finger against his lips. After gaining the pigtailed boy's silence, she began to lean in, closing her eyes to seal the agreement between them. Just before their lips could meet, Nabiki whispered the words that were ment for Ranma only, carried to his ears, by the wind that softly blew around them, before carrying them and dissipating each syllable over the Tokyo skyline.<p>"I love you, Ranma."<p>_<p>Nabiki and Ranma sat not in the balcony of Nabiki's favorite hideway, but among the crowd at the foot of the band playing soft rock. The acoustics were better there, even with the din of the audience around them. They had decided to wrap up their outing where Nabiki decided her first 'date' with Ranma was at. Since she hadn't eaten much at the restuarant, she needed at least a small bite to eat to replenish some of her energy. She had further plans for Ranma that night, if he was interested. They wouldn't be returning back home until morning... if not later.<p>Nabiki looked around, observing the other couples around her. She dearly wished she could indulge like they were; openly drinking in one another's love like a fine brand of wine far more savory than anything else, like the scent of a flower more delicious than whatever else encountered. Unfortunately, the reality of her relationship intervined.<p>She and Ranma were not like the other couples. She was a middle-aged woman with a successful career, and something of a public image that was actually rather known in the attic bar she and Ranma were in. Ranma was barely a highschool student. She purposely sat on the opposite side of the round table, ensuring to favor him with reassuring smiles that abated his questioning looks.<p>Ranma was right, even with her reservations, the night had been perfect, almost a fairytale the way it turned out. She wasn't one to believe in ideal scenarios, but there wasn't anything she realized she would change.<p>"It's been a while since I've last seen you around."<p>Nabiki looked past Ranma, to see a familiar blonde man pulling up a seat next to the pigtailed boy. "Ms. Tendou, was it not?"<p>"Who's he?" Ranma asked, surprisingly only curiosity in his voice, and no defensiveness.<p>"Um... if you'll forgive me, Mr...?"<p>The Astralian smiled, "Cromwell, Steven Cromwell." Mr. Cromwell turned to Ranma, offering his hand to shake, "And who might this guy be? You're much too young to have a son his age! Your nephew?"<p>"A little more than that," Nabiki commented wryly, "And you flatter me."<p>"Ranma Saotome," Ranma decided to introduce himself, taking the man's hand in a firm grip. Ranma wasn't jealous, since he now positively knew where Nabiki's heart lay, but that didn't mean he wasn't above intimidating the heavily outclassed competition.<p>"Whoa, some grip you got there, mate!" Steven said with a light chuckle, "Maybe you can help me with a question or two. The young lady here, Who is she seeing?"<p>Ranma's mouth almost went off, before the *look* Nabiki gave him cut off his initial response. Unfortunately, his mouth was opened, and the man next to him was now expecting a response. "Ah... n-no, I guess."<p>Nabiki blinked, and fought the urge to groan heavily, instead settling for a deep sigh. "Really now?"<p>"I'm once again flattered by your interest, but I'm afraid, as attractive as you most assuradly are, that I'm not all that available." At the mention of the other man's attractiveness, Ranma's breath caught, but he refrained from any response.<p>"Maybe I can change that, if you would allow me to buy you a drink?"<p>"If you hadn't figured it out, she's telling you to back off..."<p>Both Nabiki and Steven turned to Ranma, surprised at his sudden change of attitude. Steven quickly recovered, and addressed the pigtailed boy, "Protective of her, that shows good respect for your elders."<p>"And you'll kindly respect *her*, and go look for some other chick of the moment to act all suave with!"<p>"Ranma, I think it's time to leave," Nabiki quickly announced, coming to stand, and walking over to Ranma. She grabbed his shoulder, eliciting him to stand.<p>"Hey, mate, I didn't mean any harm there!
