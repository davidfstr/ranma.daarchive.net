</div>'Older'<p>Ranma sat on the roof, looking down to the small dew encrested back yard, currently occupied by Nabiki Tendou, as she moved through her morning katas. This time of day was the longest he was now able to see the woman for the last three days, since it was heavily apparent she was avoiding him.<p>Though a bit... uncivilized in some areas, Ranma wasn't stupid. It wasn't like he was oblivious to the rather personal nature of the questions, and truth be told, they would never have occured to him before, since he... of course... had no real interest in the 'old woman'. Unfortunately, since waking up to find her sleeping next to him that morning, an idle notion popped into his head about how comfortable she was with him there, like she never would have given a second thought about it.<p>Of course, during the day, as it popped back into his head off and on... well, he didn't *think* he was obsessing over it, but it was kind of starting to irritate him. As old as she was, he knew full well that she was experienced, but it still bothered him, a little bit, a minor annoyance of a thought that refused to disperse. He was pretty positive she wasn't a virgin, yet the idea of her already being with someone else...<p>"Stupid old woman, not like I really care or not," Ranma mumbled to himself, as he shifted to make himself more comfortable. She was starting her third kata, the one he presumed she did to maintain flexibility, which meant the bus had left about twenty minutes ago. She had two more katas to go before he would have to hightail it for school.<p>Really, it wasn't any of his business. So what if one of her old boyfriends showed up one day out of the blue, or she was seeing one at the moment that he didn't know about? It wasn't like this stupid idea of an engagement was worth anything to either of them, so it shouldn't matter to him how many guys Nabiki obviously *thought* she would always be with, only to get dumped to the side by the jerks.<p>"Lousy, stupid old woman," Ranma grumbled, shifting once again as she kicked into the side splits, holding it for three seconds, before moving on.<p>"Well, Sonny-boy, for a woman over twice your age, she still cuts a mean shape, eh?"<p>"Whatever, who cares about that angry old hagggguuuh!" Ranma jumped, seeing the mummified remains that he had met the previous week.<p>"Hello, boy," Cologne replied, giving the pigtailed boy her mos pleasant smile.<p>Ranma fought down the shudders, before responding, "What the heck are you doing up here? You wanna break a hip or something?"<p>"My Great-Granddaughter was correct," Cologne muttered to herself in Chinese, yet allowed her irritation to be visible in her tone.<p>"Damn it! Why does everyone keep speaking different languages around me?" Ranma grumbled, once again turning to watch Nabiki who was still unaware of his presence.<p>Cologne rapped Ranma with her staff just hard enough to be noticed... for several hours to come. "And why isn't it that you aren't at school? I believe it should be starting soon, and you got quite a distance to cover. If I'm not mistaken, the transit to the vicinity had already departed for the hour."<p>"I got plenty of time," Ranma replied, absently, while he continued to watch Nabiki.<p>"Hmph, I suppose you're spry enough to make it there with time enough, but I would rather you refrain from such."<p>"What's it to you?" Ranma enquired, though without much interest in the answer.<p>Cologne snorted, "Passing such habits to my Great-Granddaughter would be 'what's it to me'."<p>"Whatever."<p>Cologne hopped to the edge to get a better vantage point of Nabiki training, "Speaking of whom, where is Shampoo? She should be up by now, and there are some things I wish to discuss with her, as well as Nabiki Tendou."<p>Ranma shrugged, and didn't catch the narrow-eyed glare Cologne gave him, "Don't really keep up with her. She minds her own business, I mind mine, alright?"<p>"I see," Cologne replied, "Perhaps if you were to get to know my Great-Granddaughter, you would learn to appreciate her presence more. She is a rather attractive young lady, after all."<p>"If you disregard the fact that she'd been head-hunting me since I first met her, she is kind of cute," Ranma replied in a flippant tone that proved he wasn't much considering the conversation.<p>"I guess that would be something of a stigma between you, but not one that cannot be overcome," Cologne mused. "I suggest you head for your classes now, Sonny-boy. I'm going to have to break Ms. Tendou's regimen for some other business." With that, Cologne hopped from the roof, causing Ranma to baulk at the old woman attracting attention to their direction, and speed off.<p>Nabiki continued her workout, despite the rather powerful sensation of being watched again. She had gotten used to it for the most part, as she was pretty sure many of her neighbors, specifically the guys, often watched her practice. It's been a bit stronger lately, and she had presumed that she simply picked up another spectator. She didn't concern herself with it, since it was rather flattering, and she doubted any of them would be brave enough to approach her. Actually, that was sincerly a mixed blessing, she realized from time to time.<p>Nabiki dropped into a forward horse stance, leaning forward so her weight was more on her front right leg. She then held her arms out straight at her sides, like the wings of a bird, and twisted her torso side to side as wide as possible to stretch her sides.<p>She didn't stop, as Cologne landed in front of her, and observed her. "Khon Lon, Good morning."<p>"Good morning, dear," Cologne replied, "Interesting, so your style comprises of a little Northen White Crane as well?"<p>"It's just something I added to one of Daddy's katas. His form didn't work the sides enough. A girl's gotta keep her waist in check, after all." Instead of holding her arms out like wings, Nabiki started swinging them, as if in an exaddurated walk, keeping them straight and twisting the palms up whenever the arm swung to the front of her. "What can I do for you?"<p>"Well, I would speak with you on the status of Shampoo's schooling predicerment, as well as other things. I have some words to discuss with my Great Grandchild as well."<p>Nabiki nodded, and ceased her exercise, before motioning Cologne over to the patio furniture. "You didn't need to stop on my account, dearie," Cologne commented, "It seemed as if you would be quite capable of continuing our conversation, despite your exertion."<p>"Maybe, but it's not like I can't pick up later on," Nabiki replied, sitting in one of the thinly cusioned chairs, crossing her legs, and grabbing a towel to pat down the miniscule amounts of perspiration she was forming.<p>The Amazon Matriarch sat in the seat across from Nabiki, "You assume my visit would be curt? How unsociable of you, Ms. Tendou." Cologne gave a light smile to show she was jesting.<p>Nabiki returned it, "I'm just not going into work today. I have a few errands I'll be running around for, and they don't need me today."<p>"I see. And on the school's petition for hosting Shampoo?"<p>Nabiki shook her head, "Haven't heard a word on it, and it may be a while before I do, I'm afraid."<p>Cologne sighed, "Why must such matters of Buerocracy be dragged on so? It's important for youthful minds to progress their education, is it not?"<p>"I'm pretty sure there are quite a bit of red tape that they must go through, before we get results," Nabiki replied, "How's the restaurant coming?"<p>"Oh, it's coming along nicely, it's just a matter of time now. Perhaps you will have the honor of being my first customer?"<p>"Sounds good to me. You want me to go get Shampoo? She should be out of the bath by now."<p>"Oh, there's one thing before I talk with her. I was curious about your other ward, Ranma Saotome?" Colgone kept her face from showing how much she was trying to guage Nabiki's reaction.<p>Nabiki looked down at the plexi-glass patio table, "What about him?"<p>"I was just curious on his well-being, that's all," the Amazon Matriarch replied, shrugging.<p>"He's fine, but I haven't seen much of him lately," Nabiki answered, doing well to hold her terse tone in check.<p>"Well, as long as the two of you are getting along nicely," Cologne commented with a small, almost pleased smile, "If we could, I would like to see Shampoo now. I hope she hasn't been too much of a hassle for you? I once again thank you for hosting her for these few days."<p>Nabiki nodded, "I'll go get her, then."<p>Shortly after Nabiki walked inside, Shampoo exited in a rather timid posture, "Great-Grandmother?"<p>Cologne stared sternly at her heir, "Correct your posture, Shampoo. Carry yourself like an Amazon warrior." After Shampoo complied, Cologne continued in Mandarin, "It doesn't seem as if you've had much progress with Son-in-law..."<p>Shampoo winced, knowing that full well that her Great-Grandmother was onto her.<p>_<p>Nabiki was pretty sure the topic of conversation was on Shampoo's progress with Ranma, so she didn't have any interest in listening in. She found it humorously ironic on the lack thereof, while the fact that she was subtly trying to push Ranma onto her, until she could be lucky enough to locate their fathers, and get the whole sordid mess straightened out.<p>Pushing the slight pang of remourse to the side, Nabiki thought of how cute of a couple her two houseguests would make. Maybe if she stapled Ranma's mouth shut, he would then grow on Shampoo? Nabiki chuckled to herself, as she went to prepare for her lunch meeting with her eldest sister.<p>By the time she wrapped everything up and was ready to go, she decided that it would probably be best to invite Shampoo along. She didn't want to leave the girl in the house alone, and she had yet to introduce the Amazon to any of her family, in case they decided to visit, and make for an ackward situation.<p>Nabiki walked out back to find Shampoo with her head bowed, as her Great-Grandmother continued to admonish her. At her arrival, Cologne ceased, and favored Nabiki with a smile, "So, you'll be heading out now, Ms. Tendou?"<p>Nabiki nodded, pretending she hadn't known what they were talking about during her absence, "I wanted to ask if Shampoo wanted to come along. At least show her around a bit more."<p>"That would be a gracious gesture," Cologne replied, "But I'm afraid I'll need my Great-Granddaughter for today. I'll be needing some assistance with some more... strenuous renovations."<p>From the way Shampoo winced, Nabiki presumed that this was part of a punishment. "Alright, I didn't want to leave Shampoo here bored, that's all."<p>"Understandable," Cologne replied, "Well, best be off, so that you may take your leave. I shall speak with you later, Nabiki Tendou. Come, Shampoo, there is much that needs to be done." With that, the elder leapt to the rooftop, followed by her heir. Within an instant, they both disappeared from sight.<p>Nabiki scrunched her nose up, before emitting an impish smirk. She locked the back door, and backed out into her back yard. Bracing down, she let out a kai, as she leapt. With a couple of feet to spare, she landed on the rooftop in a crouch. She turned back to look down at the height, easily brushing aside the slight sense of vertigo. That wasn't something she had done since her early twenties, it was actually pretty invigorating.<p>She walked off the front of the roof, landing gracefully as possible, but wincing slightly at the impact; she may not have forgotten how to leap, but it may take a little while longer to properly recall landing...<p>_<p>"Hello, Nabiki... something happen to you leg?"<p>"Hi Kasumi," Nabiki returned, as she entered her old home while attempting to hide her slight limp, "Just a little childish indulgence, that's all. I'll be okay."<p>"If you say so," the elder sister replied, leading the other inside, "I'll get some ointment for your ankle, that's where the problem is, right?"<p>Nabiki nodded, as she went into the tea room, and sat down. Kasumi hadn't lost her touch, as there were two cups, a kettle of tea, a few sandwiches, and some cookies already waiting for them.<p>It wasn't long before Kasumi returned with a jar in hand, "It's a good thing father hadn't changed anything around. It was still where I used to keep it."<p>Kasumi handed the jar to Nabiki, who graciously accepted it, but put it aside, "I'll use it later."<p>Kasumi rolled her eyes, "Nabiki, your ankle's going to get worse, just humor me and do it now?"<p>"Can't it wait till after tea?"<p>"It'll still be here when you're done. Here, I'll do it for you, come on."<p>Nabiki sighed, as Kasumi moved to sit beside her sister, and was gingerly handed the wounded foot. The elder sister opened the jar of oitnment, and delicately applied it to Nabiki's ankle. "So, how's your week been, Kasumi?" Nabiki asked, starting up the conversation.<p>"Oh, nothing new. Had Kaoru check back on my apartment a few times, we haven't been burglarized yet."<p>Nabiki frowned at the joke, "Sis, I don't know why you're so insistant on living there if it's that bad..."<p>Kasumi favored Nabiki with a light smile, "It's not, I just enjoy teasing people about it. How about you? Is your torrid love affair with Ranma coming along?"<p>"No," Nabiki replied, dryly, "And you're not funny, Kasumi."<p>Kasumi shrugged, patting the top of Nabiki's foot, "All done, let me go wash my hands, and I'll be back." Kasumi got up, and went to the kitchen.<p>Nabiki stared at her ankle in distain, "This isn't going to stain my pantyhose, is it?"<p>"Oh, shut up. A pair of pantyhose is better than a bill from the hospital," Kasumi replied, returning shortly while drying her hands with a dishtowel.<p>"But these are my favorite pair!" Nabiki mock-whined, before smirking.<p>"Anything else going on in your life you'd like to tell you elder sister?"<p>Nabiki shrugged, "Not much, I... oh yeah, I picked up another houseguest. Get this, she's from some backwater tribe in China, the 'Couragious Women' or 'Chinese Amazons' they like to be called."<p>Kasumi nodded, as she poured the tea, "That must be the girl Kaoru was talking about earlier. He's been upset about her since a few days ago. Although, he was under the impression that she was Japanese... and of a bit more... unorthodox persuasion?"<p>"Huh? Shampoo has- OH! OOOH!"<p>Kasumi blinked, "Shampoo?" She thought she understood why Nabiki was laughing; it was a rather humorously unusual name.<p>"Th-that was R-Ranma... hee hee!" Nabiki chortled, "I th-think my nephew's interested in a c-certain redhead..."<p>Kasumi's face slowly went blank, as Nabiki started laughing again. "My son's in love with another boy," she stated in a soft, incredulous voice.<p>Nabiki waived it off, "Oh, he'll get over it. It's just a little crush..."<p>"A little crush like the one I got married over?" Kasumi enquired, raising an eyebrow.<p>Nabiki stopped laughing, "*Ahem*... I see your point."<p>"Thank you," Kasumi replied, curtly, as she took a sip from her tea.<p>Nabiki had been fooled for a moment, before she noticed the corner of Kasumi's mouth twitching, "Sisssssss?"<p>Kasumi smiled against her cup, "Oh, Tofu's going to looooooove this!" Both had a good laugh for about a minute, before settling down. "How did you manage to house a Chinese Amazon?"<p>"She was chasing Ranma," Nabiki said, factually, before she took a bite from one of the finger sandwiches.<p>"Oh, I think this complicates your engagement," Kasumi replied with an oblivious and straight face.<p>Nabiki nearly spit out her tea, about ready to bark a denial, before she caught the hidden smirk on her sister's face, "Geez, I still can't tell if you're being serious when you do that."<p>"It's a gift," Kasumi replied, easily.<p>"Anyways, she was actually chasing Ranma to kill him because of their laws..."<p>"So, you're dating a criminal, then? How rebellious of you!"<p>"Cut it out," Nabiki replied in her growing irritation, "Ranma defeated her in battle, and they have some law saying that Shampoo has to kill her because of it."<p>"Oh my, things have certainly been interesting for you, it sounds like."<p>Nabiki shook her head, silently chuckling, "Oh, you don't know the half of it..."<p>_<p>"And then, he had the gall to ask me about my sex life!" Nabiki stated, hiding her laughter behind her hand.<p>Kasumi laughed along with her sister, hoping Nabiki wouldn't notice how fake it was. It started out humorous, but began to go downhill from there. It wasn't that the stories weren't funny in their own right, just that they were taking a bit too much of a... problmatic nature.<p>Nabiki had referred to her first houseguest as Ranma-hon... no less than five times. The last time she recalled Nabiki calling any guy that was years ago. "Well, it's certainly been exciting for you, hasn't it?" Kasumi replied, withholding her concern.<p>"Wait," Nabiki interjected, wanting to finish her story, "That's when I decided that the rest of the day would be best if I got dru-"<p>"Oh my, I didn't realize the time..." Kasumi interrupted, catching Nabiki off guard.<p>"I've only been here about half an hour."<p>"Sorry, Nabiki," Kasumi apologised, "but I just recalled there were some things I needed to do. I hope you understand."<p>Nabiki nodded, more than slightly suspicious, "Sure, Sis. I had some grocerie shopping to do." Kasumi lead her sister to the door, and gave their goodbyes. Once Nabiki disappeared through the gate, Kasumi rushed back inside, and picked up the phone.<p>"Hello, um, good afternoon... er... it's the middle of the night there? Sorry, I had forgotten. Yes, put Akane on the phone, please... it's very important..."<p>_<p>Thomas handed the phone to his extremely irritated wife, who was swearing as to why someone was calling at that time of morning, "It's your sister, don't take this out on me!"<p>_<p>Ranma felt like being a little lazy, and decided to use the bus fair Nabiki gave him for actually riding the bus. He wondered when she would stop avoiding him for any periods less than a couple of minutes in each other's company. If he had known she was going to act like this, he would have kept his mouth shut.<p>"Looks like something's bothering you."<p>Ranma looked up to see a long haired boy standing over him, and looked outside. During his grousing, he hadn't realized they already passed two stops. "Yeah, kinda in trouble with someone."<p>"Sounds like something to talk about, care to get it off your chest?"<p>"Ah, no offense, and all... but I don't even know you," Ranma replied, sheepishly. He blinked, noticing the unusual weapon strapped to the other boy's back.<p>"That makes me a neutral party," the boy replied, "Mind if I sit down, don't like standing on the bus if I can avoid it."<p>"Be my guest," Ranma replied, scooting over to allow room.<p>"Ukyo Kuonji."<p>Ranma blinked, "Huh?"<p>"Now I'm not a stranger anymore, huh?" Ukyo replied, favoring Ranma with an effimate smirk.<p>"Uky... Uk..." It was then that Ranma remembered where he had seen such a unique weapon, "Ucchan?"<p>The other boy's face went blank, "No one's called me that since..." Slowly, the surprised expression went furious, as Ukyo reached to the large spatcula on his back...<p>_<p>Thomas sighed, wishing Kasumi could have waited a few more hours. There was a ten hour difference between them, she really should have taken that into consideration. He had business to attend during the mornings, while Akane herself had a choreography sketch to start. He needed his beauty sleep, she needed her cranky nap (not that he would ever say that out loud to her). She didn't need to hear about their sister at three A.M., and he certainly didn't need to be holding his wife in a tight bearhug, keeping her legs from touching the ground so that she couldn't gain leverage as she thrashed, swore, and growled... at three twenty-two A.M.<p>"Akane, let's calm down, okay?" Thomas attempted to suggest in his most soothing tone. A tone that was opposing to-<p>"LEMME GO! I GOT A LITTLE PERVERT TO KILL!"<p>"But you can't go kill anyone," Thomas replied, straining even harder to restrain his wife, "You have work in the morning, remember?"<p>"I'LL CALL IN LATE, DAMN IT!"<p>She meant it, too.<p>Thomas sighed, readjusting his hold as Akane worked to break his grasp. Fortunately, she wasn't thinking clearly, because he was pretty sure she would have snapped his arms off to get free if she was... well, at least severely dislocate them. "Why don't we discuss this peacefully? Would you like that?"<p>Akane visibly calmed down, "Thomas, at the moment, there's nothing more I would like to do THAN DISMEMBER THAT LITTLE BRAT THAT'S USING MY SISTER AS HIS SUGARMOMMA!"<p>Fortunately, Akane's husband hadn't dropped his guard, and managed to keep hold of Akane when she renewed her thrashing. "I'm guessing this is about Ranma, then?"<p>Right when Akane paused, the Native American took advantage, drove them both onto the bed, and while pinning her under him, quickly reached under the bed for the nylon rope they kept there for whenever Akane was 'in a weird mood', and tied her up, just like he had been taught for cattle, during his teen years helping on his uncle's ranch.<p>Coughing to hide his slightly ragged breath, and shaking the strain from his arms, Thomas sat on the edge of the bed, next to Akane's head, "Okay, now that we've settled down a bit..." he pointedly ignored the gutteral growl his wife was emitting, while she stared British greatswords at him, "...what did Kasumi tell you that got you so riled up?"<p>"Thomas, dear, if you *really* loved me, you would untie me RIGHT THIS MOMENT!"<p>"Come on, Akane, tell me a bedtime story," Thomas replied, becoming more amused with his wife's uncapped temper. Yeah, he used to also enjoy poking rattlesnakes with sticks when he was ten.<p>Akane snorted, before turning her eyes away, "Nabiki's in love with Ranma."<p>Thomas blinked, "Say that again?"<p>"Look, Nabiki fallen for Ranma, I have to go smack some sense into her and then destroy the little pervert!" Akane explained, as if it were the most logical sense in the world.<p>"Hold on, time out," Thomas called out, forming a 'T' with his hands, "How did she figure this out?"<p>"Kasumi said that all Nabiki wanted to talk about really was Ranma!"<p>Thomas shrugged, "So? She doesn't have an eventful life of her own."<p>Akane missed the hidden barb, as she seethed, before speaking again, "They slept together, too."<p>Thomas began to nod, and paused half way. Taking a deep breath, he turned away, "Oboy..."<p>"Now do you see why I must get back to Japan, and mutilate the little hormonal troll?" Akane replied, now calm.<p>Thomas decided it would be best not to laugh; nylon wasn't nearly as strong as a full-blown Akane mad-on, "You thought it was funny, the two of them together, when we were back at your Father's..."<p>"Well, yeah," Akane replied, shrugging in her bonds, "it was 'ha ha' funny then. Now it's funny in the sense that it's midly disturbing and unethical."<p>Thomas winced slightly, "Well, Nabiki wasn't always the most-"<p>"I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT THAT JERK RANMA'S DOING TO MY SISTER!" Akane shouted. Just then, their bedroom door opened.<p>"Mom, why are you..." Steven stopped short, as his eyes went wide, before slamming the door. "Ew!"<p>The Native American gave his wife a wry grin, "That's the second one of our children we've traumitized. Want to have another so we can unhinge him, too?"<p>"I'm quickly losing my patience, I can't feel my fingers, I'm tired, and did I mention I'm getting REALLY IRKED?"<p>"You said you were losing patience," Thomas clarified, oblivious to the open minefield he was currently tapdancing on, "Nabiki's a grown woman, she's capable of making her own decisions, and living with the consequences. She doesn't need you going over there, half cocked, trying to 'salvage' her dignity for her, alright?"<p>Akane sighed, "I guess you're right... untie me now?"<p>Thomas didn't buy it, "No."<p>"'No'? WHY NOT?"<p>Thomas shrugged, "Because I like you this way."<p>Akane glared even fiercer than before, "I can still bite you!"<p>"I'll gag you," Thomas replied, sliding back into bed.<p>"I'll make you a lonely man for weeks to come!" Akane threatened.<p>"This is well worth the price of absenance," Thomas replied, turning off the nightlamp, "Good night."<p>In the dark, Akane blinked, "Thomas? Thomas! This isn't funny! Let me go!"<p>"Zzzzzzzsnirkt..."<p>"WE BOTH KNOW DAMN WELL YOU DON'T SNORE!"<p>_<p>Nabiki shifted the armful of groceries she was carrying, as she unlocked the door to her house. She was still a bit puzzled as to what in the world had gotten into Kasumi, suspecting her eldest sister was going senile or something. At that notion, Nabiki frowned; she was starting to think like Nodoka.<p>A the thought of the infuriating woman, Nabiki braced herself, fully expecting Ranma's mother to be standing at the other side of the door. She felt both relief and a slight tinge of dejection, when it wasn't the case.<p>"I'm home!" Nabiki announced, just in case she wasn't waiting at the door, but was in the house nonetheless. She shrugged, when nobody replied, and walked in. She set the first bag of groceries on the step at the doorway, before going back out to her car and retrieving another bag.<p>Nobody was in the house, not even Ranma. While she was out, Nabiki decided that enough was enough, and that she needed to let Ranma off the hook. Addmittadly, she was acting a bit childish about a couple of nights ago, and let a bad day overblow the situation. Not that she didn't have a very good reason to be dramatically ticked, but she was mature enough to know when to let it go.<p>Speak of the little devil. Just as Nabiki went for the third bag of groceries, she found Ranma, laughing like he was having the time of his life with some other guy Nabiki hadn't seen before. With a wry smile, Nabiki leaned against her car, at least this one wasn't trying to kill Ranma...<p>Ranma noticed Nabiki, perched against her white BMW, "Oh, hey Nabiki."<p>"Hey to you, Ranma," Nabiki gave Ranma's friend a smile in greeting, "You going to introduce me?"<p>"Oh! Ukyo, meet Nabiki Tendou, a... um... family friend."<p>"That's one way of putting it," Nabiki commented, before leaning off of her vehicle and bowing.<p>"Ukyo Kuonji," Ranma introduced, "Buddy of mine from way back."<p>"Oh, old girlfriend?" Nabiki enquired. Ukyo's eyebrows rose to the hairline, before he began to pat himself down to ensure certain bindings were in place, and that the pants hid the hips properly.<p>Ranma baulked, "Hey! Ukyo's a guy!"<p>Nabiki blinked, before looking at Ukyo again, who smiled back nervously. "Nope, just a tomboy, from what I see."<p>"How?" Ukyo asked, thinking her attire was perfectly concealing of her true gender.<p>"Whaddya mean 'how'?" Ranma demanded, incredulously. He paused a moment, as realization overcame him. "Ukyo... you didn't... I mean, an operation! I coulda told you of a place that-"<p>Nabiki quickly went to cover Ranma's mouth, but pulled her hand back, as a large spatula collided with Ranma's head. Nabiki shook her head, while Ukyo reholstered her spatula. "Before you say something stupid-"<p>"Jusenkyo?"<p>Ukyo blinked at the question, "What?"<p>"Hot water turns you back into a guy, right?"<p>Nabiki covered her face, while the brunette scrunched her face up in confusion. Shaking the dumfounding accusation off, Ukyo continued, "Before you say something *else* stupid, I have always been one hundred percent woman!"<p>"Since when?"<p>Nabiki wanted to take a peek at Ranma's confused expression, but decided that it would probably hurt his feelings when she burst out laughing at it. Instead, she sighed, as she turned back to the house, "This sounds like it's going to be another long story. Come on in, you two."<p>_<p>Nabiki sat patiently, sipping her tea, while Ranma glared. Across the table from both of them... well, slightly off to the left, and under the table, lay Ukyo, rolling around the ground in hysterics.<p>Nabiki remained non-plussed, "I tried to warn you."<p>Ranma turned from glaring at Ukyo to Nabiki, "She was bound to find out, sooner or later."<p>Nabiki took another sip, looking over the rim of her cup at Ukyo's proximity in slight irritation, "Well, it's a moot issue, now."<p>Ranma slicked back the water that was still in her hair, before returning to scowl at her once best friend, "It's not that funny, you know? I'd appreciate it if you would stop."<p>Ukyo couldn't help it, for the irony of it all was delicious, but even that wasn't what iced the cake for her. Ranma's curse was funny, yes, but she was more intrigued by it than humored. What she found absolutely hilarious, was that she had discovered the identity of Kaoru's red-headed love.<p>While Ukyo continued to laugh, Nabiki noticed from a scrying glance the hurt on Ranma's face. Mentally sighing, Nabiki reached over, and put a hand on the redhead's shoulder, "Ranma, go ahead and go to the bathroom and take a quick shower. I'll keep Ukyo company, okay?"<p>With a hesitant nod, Ranma left the dining room. Once she heard the bathroom door close, Nabiki set her cup down, and walked around the table to where Ukyo was currently trying to fight down the last of her giggles. Favoring the brunette with a cool, unamused look, Nabiki squatted down next to the girl. "Look, Ranma's not exactly thrilled about his curse, so you can be a little more sympathetic about it."<p>That brought Ukyo's laughter short, changing her mirth to anger, "Sympathetic? If you knew what he's put me through in the first place, you wouldn't be acting so high-and-mighty!"<p>"Oh, what did he do to you when you were both what... seven?" Nabiki enquired, arching her eyebrow, "He pull your hair?"<p>"Him and his bum of a Pop left abandoned me on the side of the road after taking my dowery!" Ukyo retorted, heatedly, "Because of that, I had to spend the rest of my life as a guy!"<p>Nabiki's other eyebrow elevated to the height of the first one, "Dowery?"<p>"His and my Dad decided that we should get engaged, but instead of honoring it, they ran off with my Dad's food cart that was to be my dowery, and left me in the dust!"<p>Nabiki closed her eyes, and rubbed her temples, "Swell... Genma Saotome is definitely one of a kind." She opened her eyes, staring intensely at Ukyo, "First of all, only a few weeks ago, Genma abandoned Ranma to my care, and not out of anyone's consent. Secondly, Ranma never forced you to live as a guy. Where did you get the stupid notion, anyhow?"<p>"I had to live as a guy, because my honor demanded it!"<p>"Your parents forced you to do this?" Nabiki enquired, pulling herself up to the chair that Ukyo had been occupying earlier.<p>Ukyo remained silent, but fumed and stared at Nabiki, for a few moments, "Because of Ranma and his miserable excuse for a Dad, my honor-"<p>"That wasn't what I asked," Nabiki interjected, already seeing her suspicions being confirmed, "Did your parents insist on this?"<p>"It's about my honor!" Ukyo repeated, bringing herself to knealing.<p>"In other words, you decided this all on your own," Nabiki replied with a slightly distainful glance.<p>Ukyo pursed her lips, feeling herself become angrier, "What else could I do? What type of guy would marry a girl who's dowery was stolen?"<p>Nabiki easily replied, "A guy that really does love the girl, regardless of what she has to offer, perhaps?"<p>Ukyo fell completely silent at that, not knowing how to respond.<p>The older woman's expression softened, before she stood up, and reached a hand down to help the girl up, "Kuonji, I can't apologise personally for what you say Ranma did to you, and I won't apologise for Genma, since I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be sorry for it, even if he were confronted with it. But, it's obvious Ranma sees you still as a friend, and from the looks of things, I don't think he gets many of them."<p>Ukyo begrudgingly took Nabiki's hand, and came to standing, "Is that supposed to make me fell better for losing the last nine years of my life?"<p>"That, you can only blame yourself for, Kuonji," Nabiki replied with a stern tone, "and what you just did to Ranma probably upset him as much as his father leaving him in the middle of the night did."<p>"And that's supposed to make *me* feel guilty how?" Ukyo asked, folding her arms.<p>"I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, just letting you know that you're in the same boat with Ranma."<p>"Look, I'm willing to try to be friends with Ranma again, okay?" the chef replied, curtly, "but I'm not just going to forget what he played a part in what happened to me. You may think that he's not at fault, but if he really did care, I wouldn't have had to hunt for him for all this time!"<p>Nabiki gave an exaddurated sigh, "I guess that's all I can ask, but don't treat his curse like a joke, alright?"<p>"Fine," Ukyo responded, "Tell Ranma I had to go, I've been out long enough as it is."<p>"Sure," Nabiki replied, though unsure if she was leaving because of their conversation, or the reason she gave was truthful, "I'll walk you ot the door."<p>Ukyo shook her head, "I can show myself out." Nabiki continued sitting at the table, listening to the door close behind Ukyo. She had thought she may have found someone that wasn't after Ranma's hide that knew him, but unfortunately, her hopes were denied. If every one of Ranma's former aquaintances were animostic towards him now, she could only guess how lonely a life he's probably lived.<p>_<p>Ukyo walked down the street that was just in front of her new restaurant, thinking over earlier that day. When realization had hit her that she was sitting next to on that bus, she didn' even bother to refrain from her fury... that was until one of the other pedestrians accidentally bumped into her.<p>The bus was too crowded for her to even consider starting a fight with Ranma right then and there, but she was more than ready to let him know that he was number one on her hitlist that existed exclusively of one man. Of course, the jerk would act like nothing had happened since the last they parted, remeniscing about old times. Eventually, even Ukyo had to recollect some of those times with fondness... the inconsiderate jerk! She was supposed to be getting revenge on him, not sharing memories!<p>Of course, that woman he was staying with forced her to at least try to let bygones be bygones, and Ukyo agreed. Of course, at the time it was to shut Nabiki up, but now that she considered it, she could had just left before it got to that point.<p>"Great, now I can't beat up the jackass for ruining my life," Ukyo grumbled, now honor-bound not to pound Ranma flat.<p>"Ukyo? Something wrong?"<p>Kuonji looked up from her glowering at the ground, to find Kaoru standing at the door to her restaurant, waiting for her. She had completely forgot they were supposed to be working on the interior again today, and she wondered just how long he had been sitting out there, waiting for her.<p>"Oh, sorry, Sugar, something had come up," Ukyo apologised, "You... didn't wait for me the whole time, did you?"<p>Kaoru smiled nervously, "Um, actually, I got her kind of late the first time, and I came back here just a few minutes ago. So no harm done, really."<p>Ukyo smiled, and nodded, before unlocking the door, "Well, we got a couple of hours to get something done, you up to it?"<p>Kaoru nodded, following Kuonji in, "I don't have anything better to do, although... I kind of wanted to get some more of your advice on... you know who..."<p>Ukyo's eyes widened, remembering Ranma's curse, and Kaoru's infatuation. She had to turn away from the younger boy in order to hide the devious smirk on her face. If she couldn't harm a hair on Ranma's head, she could still get her revenge through other means. And the best thing about it, was no harm would come out of it, other than a certain pigtailed childhood friend's embarrassment.<p>_<p>Ranma had heard the whole conversation between Nabiki and Ukyo, having instead of actually going to shower, ran the shower tap, and closed the door gently enough not to be detected. Once again, another aspect of his life his father ruined for him. If it weren't for the fact that he cared for his old man, he would have suggested that Genma never come back. Actually, he probably still would, just not as vehemantly.<p>He watched Nabiki lazed about on the couch, just listening to some acoustic guitar music that even had him mellowing a great deal. That was probably a good thing, as he was starting to go to his wits end as to how to make it up to Ukyo for what he unwittingly was an accomplice in.<p>"Ranma, come and sit down for a minute," Nabiki called out, without even turning around to acknowledge his presence.<p>Ranma complied, sitting at the far end of the couch while Nabiki occupied the near middle, just aside from the seam in the cushioning where it had been recently repaired, "Sup?"<p>"Ranma, you think of Ukyo as one of your best friends, right?" Nabiki enquired, keeping her eyes closed, as her head was lolled back.<p>"She is my best friend," Ranma replied, quietly.<p>Nabiki opened her eyes, and looked towards the pigtailed boy. He wasn't looking at her, instead studying his lap with a meloncholy expression, so she allowed the sympathy to cross her face. She presumed he didn't know how Ukyo really felt about him, and that if he ever found out, he would be completely crushed.<p>She scooted over, and patted his leg, causing him to jump slightly, "Ranma, I'm glad you found an old friend like Ukyo, but I just want you to realize that a relationship can change between two people, over time."<p>Ranma didn't speak, just nodded.<p>"I just want you to remember, that if things don't go the way you expect them to, you at least have me, Shampoo, and Ryoga to start with. And I have a sneaking suspicion Kaoru has an interest meeting you again, too."<p>Realizing that Nabiki was attempting to console him in preparation for a heavy blow that he had already recieved, Ranma gave her faint smile, "Thanks, I appreciate it."<p>Nabiki reached over, and hugged him with her closest arm for a brief moment, "Don't mention it, just wanted you to know that things can always work out for the best."<p>_<p>Kasumi appreciated her son visiting for the night, but she was becoming a bit irritated at his wistfulness; he was currently acting just as bad as his father, when she finally began dating him so many years ago.<p>She let her four-year old son Sie work in his coloring book alone, as she went to sit next to her eldest son. Kaoru looked up, somewhat surprised by the sudden attention his mother was giving him, "Uh, something a matter, Mom?"<p>Kasumi stared at her son, before nodding to herself; it was time to nip this little love problem Kaoru was having in the bud before it could cause some serious problems down the line. Grabbing her startled son by the shoulders, she gave him her most serious expression, "Kaoru, I just want you to know, that whatever happens, whatever you decide about your life, I love you, and you're my son. The only thing I would want, is for you to be happy, understood?"<p>Kaoru blinked, puzzled, "Ah... s-sure... Mom... thanks..."<p>Kasumi gave Kaoru a big smile, which was actually an attempt to hide how much she wanted to laugh.
