</div>'Older'<p>The sun had risen almost an hour ago, but hadn't reached the sleeping couple until that moment. The rays that managed to become bright enough to be noticed caressed Nabiki's face, bringing her to stir.<p>She moaned in distain, not wanting to wake up just yet, as her momentarily tensed muscles along her shoulderblades relaxed against Ranma's chest in her unoconcious agitation. Her head lalled into his neck, bringing the top of her crown to rub against his chin, bringing him slightly out of his slumber.<p>His hands gripped a bit more against Nabiki's stomach, as he started to come to. The pigtailed boy attempted to sit up, before realizing that something was holding him down. A person... Nabiki. He craned his head to look at her slightly flinching expression, caused to do so by his movements and the warming sun. He wasn't sure how many hours ago it had been since he had been able to sample the flavor of Nabiki's lips, inhale the subdued aroma of her breath that was intermingled with her rasberry shampoo and almost absent perfume. Eyelids covered those glorious irises he felt great desire to simply delve into, while a nose almost too perfect on her presented for an adorably kissable potrusion. The slight crows feet that had settled on the corners of her eyes didn't even begin to detract from her gentle, relaxed beauty; the signature of her age only served to enhance her into a timely, mature loveliness that Ranma couldn't help but appreciate and savor now.<p>Ranma's awakening further stimulated Nabiki, causing her eyes to flutter open, even if in protest. Any sounds or comments of irritation were stopped, as her vision focused on the the head that happened to be beside hers. She turned, and found Ranma unusally observative expression displayed before her.<p>She smiled a smile of one who had felt true contentment, "Good morning."<p>Ranma had been taken back by the smile, before returning with one of his own, "Good morning." It had been the first word he had been allowed to say since last night. When Nabiki had gently pinned him to the wall, giving him a demanding kiss that was filled with every prayer, every ounce of feeling, and every emotional need within her, he would have been struck dumb and unable to utter anything remotely sensible.<p>The kiss, he was completely absorbed in it like an inescapable undertow in an ocean, and felt no desire to end it. Unfortunately, the necessity to breath had overwhelmed Ranma, as he had completely forgotten to do so during the intimite contact. When he finally managed to break his lips away from hers to inhale, He felt the need to say something, anything.<p>That need was denied, as Nabiki silently pleaded with him not to say anything, not one word. Ranma complied, and allowed himself to be lead back to the couch. The older woman was too afraid to hear whatever Ranma would have said at that moment. Fearing that it wasn't a reality, fearing that he then didn't feel the same way she had thought, fearing the three words of emotional commitment that could be given and expressed almost too cheaply. All she simply wanted from him, was for him to provide her with that missing sense of security she had longed for, even secretly without concious realization, as she simply laid in his arms.<p>The entire night, they remained laid upon the couch, gently entwined in each other's embrace, moving not an iota, floating in warm waters on gentle crests of their emotions. To Nabiki, it was more than euphoric and greater than heartwrenching at the same time. Her need had grown beyond what she had even anticipted, making her carnal want for Ranma nearly unbearable. Yet, she would not go further, because she didn't sincerely think he was ready for that. Not only that, she knew she was far from ready for that, too.<p>Admitting her feelings was just one step, a profound step, but one step nonetheless. That level of intimacy on the other hand, that total surrender of herself, would carry a great deal of power over the two of them. Crestfallen at her own decision, she felt the need for caution and prudence against it. Her sensibilities still held a tenatious grip, reminding her of how youthful Ranma was. Granted, many boys his age and younger had already gained some experience, but she felt obligated to do this at Ranma's pace. She hoped such a decision wouldn't leave her too far fustrated in the end.<p>Her own hands drew down onto Ranma's overlapping them in a light grip. Shifting slightly to get more comfortable, Nabiki lifted her chin to favor Ranma with a light peck. Ranma accepted, still all too new to the situation, yet finding himself easily becoming comfortable with it. As he hesitatingly pulled away, he began to look around the living room, "What time is it?"<p>Nabiki groaned at the question, "Who cares, Ranma?"<p>"Well, since there was *one* person who had to bring up my playing hookie for a day..." Ranma retorted. This time, his goading had lost something, and had it replaced entirely with another aspect. Before, Ranma's comments of the like tended to border between sincere and unmalicious humor, leaving one too confused to how they should take it, and grating on their composure. Now, it was told with a tone that stated it required a punchline, instead of a scathing remark.<p>"Well," Nabiki mock-mused, bringing her finger to her lips in thought, "As long as you're playing hookie with me today, I don't see much of a problem for the time being."<p>Ranma's wry smirk turned back into a small smile, before changing into a serious one, "Nabiki... I know I love you and all-"<p>"No," Nabiki softly interjected, as her expression changed to a somber one. The three words, they had to come up at some time. "Ranma, I care deeply for you, and I guess it's the same as you feel, but don't confuse it."<p>"What do you mean?" Ranma enquired with a tone laden with a tiny bit of hostility. He did not like the vunerable feeling that Nabiki had suddenly instilled within him.<p>Nabiki sighed, knowing that this explanation may not be taken easily. "Ranma... what we have, I... it's not love. At least not yet."<p>"Then what would you call it?" Ranma relaxed, but only a bit. He still demanded a full explantion, though.<p>Nabiki knew this wasn't love, because she had felt this before. There was the sensation of euphoria, as well as a contentment, but it lacked... something. "Like I said Ranma, I know we do care a great deal for each other, but there are a few things that need to be added to the equation."<p>"Yeah...?"<p>"Ranma," Nabiki began in a solumn tone, "What... do you need me? I mean, do you honestly feel that your life now won't stray far from mine?" Nabiki asked the question, bearing herself to the brunt of whatever blow Ranma may deliver in his answer. If anything, she could at least cherish the one night Ranma comforted her.<p>"Uh..." Ranma thought on it, almost too strongly, "Yes?"<p>Nabiki felt the lack of assured commitment in his response, and a shock of hurt because of it. She knew well enough not to take it to heart, but he had provided her with the crux of the matter. "Ranma, thank you, but I think we've got a long way to go, before we both can really believe that."<p>Ranma faltered, knowing full well his reply didn't sound all that convincing. More than anything, he was confused over the situation. He thought he knew his own feelings, but for him to sound so unsure, and Nabiki's words possibly held truth in them.<p>"More than anything, I would like to say it is, but it just wouldn't be true. You know? I don't even really know for sure what true love is, myself. But I know this isn't it, it's just too easy to believe it is." Nabiki finished, giving him a sorrowful expression, "But, if it's any consolence, there's no one I feel closer to than you right now."<p>Ranma remained silent, not sure of how to accept the situation. Just thinking on it was confounding him. After several minutes, Ranma needed an escape to think on things, "I gotta get to school."<p>"No... Ranma... could we please," Nabiki relaxed her head onto his chest, and almost purred, "We really don't have anywhere too important to be, right now."<p>Not that it wouldn't have taken much, but Ranma relented.<p>_<p>Shampoo wore a shell-shocked expression as she stared at the closed door. She did not want to leave her room.<p>Last night, she and her elder had an extensive talk over things. Shampoo no longer could forestall events, especially after her argument with the woman who was graciously allowing her to stay in her home. And, if Nabiki wasn't willing, the Amazon may as well give into her own fate.<p>Coming in late last night and finding Nabiki and Ranma were occupied with each other, totally threw her for a loop. It was a bittersweet sensation to see the two of them actually together, but now, she was unfortunately commited to her path.<p>Her path, would undoubtedly lead to a great deal of pain for everyone involved, and under that realization, the young Amazon had to curse her Great Grandmother for her insistance. This, like much in life, would be a trial that Shampoo had to face, but saw no favorable avenue. As a potential matriarch, Shampoo found her first test in integrety; as a friend, it would be a test of loyalty.<p>_<p>Ranma felt the soft wash of energy pour from the base of his skull and travel along the network of muscles in his arm, to finally extend beyond his fist in an imaginary golden glow. He recovered to rest position, and took a deep breath. As he wrapped up his internal chi building exercises, he knelt, and turned to watch Nabiki within her own exercises.<p>The pigtailed boy allowed his confusion to show when he realized she was too rapt in her own practice to notice him at the moment. It wasn't love? He would be the last to say he had much experience in these things, but on this, he wasn't all too sure if he could simply believe Nabiki. How could it not be? It was unlike anything he had ever felt before, and a feeling he most certainly didn't want to be without again.<p>Just watching her move, just seeing her there before him was filling him with sensations that made him feel ever more powerful, ever more confident, ever so much more successful than he had ever been. Even with his accomplishments in the art, the simple knowledge that she, the woman in his view that moved with a grace and finesse that few ever hoped to accomplish, returned his feelings with the same vigor he harbored. She was charming in ways that transcended age to him, she was compassionate to a capacity he dearly yearned to revel in, she was passionate to a degree that elevated his own emotions, she was beautiful in ways he couldn't even find comparison.<p>These were feelings he couldn't help but label under the explicit and definitive tag of 'love'. I couldn't imagine himself feeling any stronger than he did now, and to even attempt to comprehend more potent emotions baffled him. Love was the ultimate accumilation of the most positive emotions, bringing about either good or ill; this must be love, that's all there was to it.<p>But, why did he hesitate at Nabiki's prior question? For that matter what did she mean by him having to 'need' her? Ranma had grown autonomous throughout his life; with Genma as a father, as well meaning as the man attempted to be the majority of the time, he had to learn to survive on his own, he had to grow his own independence. Just because he was capable of existing away from Nabiki if necessary, how did that diminish anything?<p>To him, it didn't, but Nabiki seemed resolved in her belief, and saddened by it. As much as it begalled him to consider it, as old as she was, she most likely had the experience in the area. Even so, Ranma resolved that he *would* have her realize that he loved her.<p>"Finished already, Ranma?"<p>The pigtailed boy blinked, not even realizing that she had ceased her own morning training, and was looking back at him with a mixture of wry humor, curiousness, and concern. Ranma became slightly flustered, and came to standing, "Ah, it's not that, I just had things on my mind, you know?"<p>Nabiki gave him a small smile, before replying in a subdued tone, "Yes, I guess there are a lot of things we need to discuss. We better sit down, first."<p>Ranma nodded, as they moved over to the patio furniture. Nabiki chose to sit in a chair, as Ranma stood before her, gently fidgeting with his hands, and somewhat dreading where the conversation could lead. Nabiki turned to look over the fence and the houses beyond her backyard, as if waiting for something to intervine in some small, desperate hope.<p>"Ranma," Nabiki began, after several long moments, finally turning to the pigtailed boy, "What do you want to do, now?"<p>Understandably, Ranma was confused by the question, "Huh?"<p>Taking a deep breath, Nabiki drummed up more courage to continue, "Ranma, don't think things are going to be all that easy for us. I... I have no idea what's going to come next any more than you do right now, and if you forgive me for saying this, any relationship between us isn't exactly going to be something either of us could brag about."<p>Ranma nodded, following so far, "I understand that, but what does that mean?"<p>The question wasn't contradicary, regardless of how it sounded. "I'm not sure what your idea of romance is, Ranma, but I... I would have to ask if you... would keep it between us... for the time being."<p>Ranma understood the prudence, but that didn't make it any less painful to accept. Closing his eyes and ceasing the fiddling with his fingers, Ranma answered, "Sure."<p>Nabiki felt just as hurt in making her request, but could easily forsee the consequences if they were to become too open about things. Not that she believed it was any of their damn business, but it simply wouldn't pay to do so. At Ranma's down crested expression, Nabiki shifted her eyes down in regret, and then stood. Ranma watched her, as she stepped into him, and wrapped her arms around his waist.<p>"Ranma, listen to me. It isn't like I'm ashamed of you or anything. You may just be the best thing that ever happened to me, in fact." With that, she pulled him into a warm hug, almost standing on her toes to rest her head on his shoulder, "I'll admit it now, I've been a pretty lonely woman, and not from any lack of attention, either. With you, I don't feel like I've just got myself now, and I want you to realize that you have me, too. First and foremost, we're friends before we're partners of any sort, Ranma. Before we go any father with *us*, you're going to acknowledge that, too."<p>Ranma blinked, and looked at Nabiki's serious expression, "But, I..."<p>"Are we still friends, Ranma?"<p>Closing his mouth, Ranma allowed a faint smile to cross his lips, before nodding.<p>Nabiki smiled at him, "Good. Of course, that doesn't mean we aren't MORE than friends, right?"<p>At that, Ranma chuckled, "Maybe if one of us made up her mind?"<p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow, internally attempting to decide if that was simply Ranma's humor, or a dejected barb disguised as such. Quickly deciding that she was being paranoid, Nabiki kissed him lightly on the lips. "Hey, Mr. Saotome, I've firmly got my mind made up about you."<p>"You do?" Nabiki backed away, patting Ranma on the ribs before walking towards the back door, leaving Ranma standing there, waiting for an answer. "Hey! Wait a sec!"<p>Nabiki had already removed her shoes and was heading for her room. At Ranma demand, she paused and looked over her shoulder, "Ranma, I'm going to go take a much needed shower. So unless you intend to join me, the conversation will have to wait for a few minutes." There wasn't even a suggestive lilt, but Nabiki's question was far from innocent.<p>Ranma blinked, before becoming flushed. He shifted his eyes to the ground, and began to scratch the back of his head, "Ah, i-if that's okay with you. I mean I can change into a girl or something, I mean I like you and all but I don't want to make you... you know feel uncomfortable or anything.<p>"I'm not the one who seems uncomfortable with the idea," Nabiki thought to herself. Outwardly sighing, Nabiki patted Ranma on the cheek, "Give me a few minutes, okay?"<p>"Alright," Ranma complied, visibly relaxing. He didn't notice the way the twinkle in Nabiki's eye diminished just slightly, as she attempted to hide her slight fustration.<p>As Nabiki entered her room, Ranma went into the living room and sat on the couch. It wasn't the first time he considered it, but domesticality was a lot more boring than when he used to travel all the time. There was so much more that had to be done, plus his father never allowed him to become lax on his training. But there was one thing, as long as he was around Nabiki, being bored was infinitely too small a price to pay for the pleasure he had now.<p>Suffering until her return, Ranma chose to meditate for the time being, until her return. Without opening his eyes, he caught the light wiff of her shampoo and bodywash, and wondered how he had never noticed it's pleasantness before.<p>"See? That didn't take long at all, did it Ranma-hon?" Nabiki enquired, dressed in a tasteful sweat set, "So, what do we do now?"<p>Ranma remained confused at the question that Nabiki proposed earlier, and didn't care to ponder on it for the time being, "Didn't you ask me that already?"<p>Staring at the pigtailed boy with a slightly confused expression, it took a minute or so before it dawned on Nabiki what he meant. Picking up one of the pillows from the couch, she threw it at him, "No, you jerk, I mean for today. It's not like either of us can really go out, since we're supposed to be other places right now."<p>"It's not like anyone's gonna catch us, and if they do, what would they care?"<p>"That's besides the point, Ranma," Nabiki chided, "Besides which, I'm not really in the mood to go out anywhere. Want to watch a few movies?"<p>"That your answer to anything? Watch a movie?"<p>Nabiki smirked, heading to the DVD stand, "Ranma-hon, you're now dating a woman in her mid-thirties, don't expect any daring ideas... at least just yet."<p>Ranma blinked, and put his finger to his chin in thought, "Thirty-seven is consider 'mid thirties'?"<p>Ranma chuckled, as he faded back from another thrown pillow. Irritated at her miss, Nabiki restarted her trek for her DVD collection, "I haven't run out of pillows just yet, Ranma, so I'd advise you to keep your mouth shut."<p>"Whatever you say, old woman," Ranma replied, still laughing.<p>"Jerk," Nabiki mumbled half-heartedly.<p>_<p>Shampoo opened the front door, almost cautiously, and decided against announcing her presence. With care, she closed the door, attempting not to make a sound. Nabiki's car was still out front, and though she had already presumed Ranma wasn't going to school since he had already been late, she wasn't quite expecting Nabiki to be home, also.<p>Nonetheless, she didn't really want to confront either of them at the moment. Things were about to get extremely awkward between the three of them, and she wanted to limit her contact with them until she was fully prepared for what was going to be done.<p>The young Amazon once again cursed herself for her blindness. She was wholly convinced that Nabiki had no intention of bothering with Ranma. Even if she was denying her feelings, she made her stance known. Of course, the heart would never allow itself to be denied, as the events of last night had proven.<p>The way things were standing now, Nabiki would most likely be seriously considering Ranma as her suiter, which meant it ran completely in conflict with Shampoo's own obligation. Shampoo had decided that Ranma would at least make a proper trophy husband, something to present around the village, before allowing him to his own devices. She imagined he would simply continue his training, which was all fine for her, so he wouldn't put up too much of a fuss about things after it was all said an done. The Amazons had great resources of Martial Arts knowledge from the world over; Mayan battle techniques to modern day military special forces styles. Ranma most assuradly wouldn't run through their whole archive in his lifetime, even if he ended up living as long as her own Great Grandmother or the ancient village demon.<p>Their marraige would be probably at the most superficial. There would be no dishonor if there was mutual consent of maintaining an open marraige, as long as they produced a child between them. Shampoo wasn't emotionally interested in Ranma, but she had to admit that she wouldn't have minded a few romps with him. Other than that, her village was filled with plenty of girls who would find him highly interesting, as long as he didn't open his mouth and say something.<p>All in all, the spirit of her laws would be satiated, and she would be off the hook. The ancesters had a twisted sense of humor, it seemed.<p>Shampoo could hear the TV going, and knew they both were probably in the living room. She was already in the house, so leaving would be asinine, not to mention it would probably attract unneeded questions if they noticed her arrival and departure.<p>As casually as she could manage Shampoo strode into the living area, on her way upstairs. Nabiki immidiately noticed her presence, and quickly sat up from Ranma's lap, "Shampoo, we didn't hear you come in!"<p>"Sorry, have lots of things on mind," Shampoo replied noncomittaly, "Tired now. I am going to take nap."<p>Nabiki looked at Shampoo with a concerned expression, "You okay? There's a bug going around, and I'm guessing you're not all that entirely used to the climate here."<p>"No sick. I rarely get sick, but thank you for concern." Shampoo gave a weak smile to punctuate her statement, "We shall talk later."<p>Nabiki and Ranma watched Shampoo as she trudged upstairs, not looking back. Once they were sure she was out of hearing, Nabiki turned her worried expression to Ranma, "I wonder what's wrong with her?"<p>Ranma could only shrug, "No clue, she didn't seem her usual bubble-headed self, so obviously something's upsetting her."<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes, "Can't you say anything nice about her?"<p>"Hey! I'm just as concerned about her as you are, but it's not like we can do anything about it."<p>Nabiki sat up on the couch completely, wary of having Shampoo find them in such an intimate position again, "That's not what I asked, Ranma."<p>_<p>Shampoo closed the door, silently, and sighed. The flood doors were obviously open now, of course, it wouldn't have taken her current witnessing of their private displays of affection to confirm it. As much as she wanted to stall, time was out. If a declaration wasn't made by the time her Great Grandmother came around, Cologne WOULD intervine, and no one would be happy.<p>Why did things have to get so complicated? Shampoo recalled not much more than a month ago, her task was to avenge herself upon an impudent redhead before she had gotten too far. Of course, said redhead proved to have the survival instincts of the staunchest of cowards, and drew Shampoo's trek all they way to Japan. Once she arrived in such a dismal country, she met Nabiki; someone much like her ilk, who hadn't even been born within the confines of her home village, proving that such women existed in the outside world. Much more, Nabiki also proved that they didn't necesarrily have to be warriors, either.<p>Shampoo had to admit she was a little star-struck. Nabiki was strong, independant on her own, not even needing the support of clan sisters. Once she got to know the woman as a friend, the idealism had worn off, but the admiration still continued. Unfortunately, as a friend, she also got to witness Nabiki's flaws. She may be a strong woman, but she was weak with the heart. She hadn't gotten all the details from Jesse, but something horrible had happened to her, and Shampoo didn't care to pry out of respect.<p>To anyone standing on the outside paying attention, Nabiki had a great deal of interest in Ranma, and it seemed the boy shared that interest. Of course, such a limited, backwater, ridged society would put stipulations on who you could love; such an asinine taboo, for a woman still able of childbirth to not a allow herself to be infatuated with a male capable of providing her of her wishes.<p>Eventually, even Shampoo lost the urge to fight the woman. She was stubborn as any proud warrioress, and was not hesitant in proving so. Now, thanks to Shampoo's submittal to what Nabiki THOUGHT was the truth...<p>Shampoo gulped at the unpleasant sensations at her chest. She didn't want to hurt Nabiki or Ranma, but there wasn't much in options. The uncomfortable sensations grew, as she thought about the whole ordeal, grew until they became strangely arousing. Unable to cope with the sensation, Shampoo put her hand to her chest, hoping they would cease...<p>_<p>"AAAAAIIIIIYYYYYAAAAAA!"<p>At Shampoo's scream, Nabiki's eyes went wide, before the scrunched up, and she flopped her head against the back of the couch. Ranma stared incredulously, as Nabiki then commenced to bang the back of her head against the backrest repeatedly.<p>"Ah... Nabiki? Sup?"<p>"Nononononononononononononono..." was all the reply he recieved, as Nabiki was lost in her mantra. Before Ranma could demand what was wrong with her, he heard Shampoo stomping down the stairs, and turned to see the girl... aiming a crossbow in their general direction.<p>"WHOA!" Ranma tackled Nabiki to the ground, as the furious Amazon let an arrow rip. Ranma sat up, keeping a still despairing Nabiki under him, "WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU?"<p>Shampoo paid him no attention, as she loaded another arrow, and seemed to be tracking something. Ranma followed her sight, seeing a black blur buzz around the room. The pigtailed martial artist saw Shampoo's eyes narrow, as she unleashed another arrow.<p>The meaty 'thong' sounded, as it imbedded into the wall, just barely missing the speeding object of her irritation. The sound of the arrow also brought Nabiki out of her stupor, as she attempted to sit up, but found Ranma's thighs pinning her to the ground around her waist. From her position, she was able to see Shampoo on the stairs, tracking who she well knew to be, attempting to get a clear shot.<p>Nabiki tracked Shampoo's aim, before nearly going hysterical, "SHAMPOO! NO! NOT AT THE TV!"<p>Unfortunately, Shampoo was more interested in impaling something than even considering what Nabiki was screaming about. Even with her abundant anger, Shampoo had enough sense of mind to exhale slowly, just as her fingers gently relenquished hold on the base of the arrow.<p>Ranma and Nabiki watched, as the arrow seemed to go in slow motion, before it came to immidiate rest... right between a stubby index and forefinger.<p>"Hey, watch it there, sweetie!" Chided the ancient midget that was hanging from the front of Nabiki's large television, as his other hand was holding the shaft of the arrow with the point less than a centimeter from the screen, "This TV's one of the best reasons to hang out at Dear Nabiki's!"<p>"Hu... Who are you?" Ranma enquired, mildly impressed that the old man managed to stop the arrow with barely any consideration.<p>Nabiki was the one to answer for Ranma. Only one thing could make a girl scream like Shampoo did. One thing she had hoped would never show itself around her for a long... long time. Preferably when she was old and gray herself.<p>"Happosai," Nabiki moaned, feeling the mother of all headaches coming on.<p>_<p>"Happosai?" Ranma repeated, relaxing once the danger had seemed to subside. Nabiki had confisctated Shampoo's bow, insisting that she would return it to her Great Grandmother when she had the opportunity.<p>Nabiki continued to rub her temples, sure that a migrane was coming into affect, before she turned a tired glare over to the miniscule man sitting in a chair with a booster seat. After sighing resignedly, the older woman gestured over to him. "Ranma, allow me the... pleasure of introduction you to Grandmaster Happosai. The master and founder of our school."<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow at Nabiki, "Anything Goes is around three hundred years old... at least that's what Pops says, and that's one thing he won't lie about is our school."<p>"HA! Three hundred and fourteen years and still goin' strong! Why, the reason I'm so fit and virile is the same as how Nabiki-dear manages to keep her gorgeous looks!" the old man crowed, taking a break from nursing on a bottle of Nabiki's stock, "Say, Nabiki-dear, this is good stuff, as usual for your tastes!"<p>Nabiki gave him a lopsided smirk, flattered by backhanded compliment "Well, that bottle I had saved, just for you."<p>"Heh, I can tell, blends in well with the asenic. How'd you get it in here without popping the cork, anyhow?"<p>"Hypodermic needle," Nabiki answered, factually, before both her and Happosai began to chuckle.<p>Shampoo looked between them, confused, "Arsenic have no taste..."<p>"Did I just miss something, here?" Ranma added, just as confused as the Amazon.<p>"Little running joke," Nabiki answered, calming down a bit, "Daddy was always trying to make attempts on Granpa, here. Always said it was for the safety of his little girls."<p>"Pah, not like you girls needed any saving from me!" Happosai proclaimed.<p>"Touch me, and I take away your TV privileges indefinitely," Nabiki stated, still rubbing her temples.<p>Happosai blinked, and relaxed; to Shampoo and Ranma, it looked only as if the old man was settling in his seat, not abstaining from a pounce. "Ah... heh, I guess you still hadn't lost your touch, huh, Nabiki-dear?"<p>"Nope, Grandfather, you most assuradly taught me well."<p>"Wait a minute, what's this about your Pops try'n to kill the Grandmaster of our school?" Ranma enquired. He wasn't all that much for tradition, but he did know a little respect. He was pretty sure trying to off the guy (though he was pretty sure Nabiki was only pulling his leg on the 'founder' part) was displaying a good lack of it.<p>"No blame Nabiki father," Shampoo commented, under her breath. The only thing that was keeping her hand still was the fact that Nabiki threatened to tie the young girl down to a chair if she didn't behave. Shampoo would normally have scoffed at the idea, but the idea of being helpless even momentarily near the letcherous demon was enough to quell her.<p>"Soun ol-boy was a bit high strung, wasn't he?" Happosai mused, "Not that he ever had a chance of succeeding!"<p>"But... um, why?" Ranma enquired, still in the dark. "HEY! WHADDYA DO THAT FOR?"<p>Shampoo continued to look away from Ranma, as she retracted her upended glass of water. She was unable to see how Ranma's eyes went suddenly wide, as panic began to settle over the redhead.<p>Nabiki glared at the Amazon, temporarily ignoring the screaming redhead that was running back and forth, "Didn't I tell you to behave?"<p>Shampoo shrugged, and buffed her nails against her sleeves, "One minute, then Ranma too, too understand and shut up."<p>Ranma ran back to the table, grabbing one of the empty chairs, and held it up in preparation of pounding an unsightly blemish on her chest off. Nabiki quickly stood up, jerked the chair from girl's hands, and glared down at her. Ranma returned Nabiki's glare with an irked expression, before pointing to the sizable lump fastened to her chest.<p>"Okay, Happosai, that's enough," Nabiki commanded rather tiredly, as she effortlessly plucked the short man from Ranma's chest.<p>"Well, how about that? Hadn't seen a Jusenkyo curse in years!"<p>"And you managed to get a pretty good tactile experience of one, at that," Nabiki quipped, setting Happosai in the chair next to her.<p>"Youuuuuu," Ranma seethed, ready to pounce on the little man. Not that Ranma really cared all that much for modesty, but the experience left her feeling more than a little outraged, and quite more than a little unsanitary.<p>"Sit down, Ranma."<p>"But... he..."<p>"Just... sit down, alright?" Nabiki pleaded with an almost helpless expression. Ranma grumbled, but complied, making sure to keep an eye on Happosai, and pulling her chair as far away from the table as possible without leaving the room.<p>"Happosai," Nabiki started, trying to gain her wits again, "Not that it's a... pleasure to have your company with us again, but you should be..." Nabiki made the calculations, "In Jamaica right now."<p>"Yeah... funny thing about that trip you girls got me for my birthday," Happosai responded, scratching the back of his head, nervously, "Expect your money back on it, soon."<p>"I don't want my money back, I want you go-," Nabiki quickly recovered, "The money isn't important, I was rather hoping you would still be enjoying yourself. I mean even as long as you lived, you probably don't have many years left in you."<p>"Well, you see, it appears I'm no longer welcome on that island," Happosai replied, chagrinned, "And I thought Jamaicans were supposed to be nice fellows..."<p>"Then why didn't you just head back to the United States?" Nabiki asked, attempting to remain non-plussed.<p>"You know it's actually pretty darn easy to get on the FBI's most wanted list there?" Happosai answered, making a subtle allusion.<p>"Canada?" Nabiki asked, her voice becoming somewhat strained.<p>"Funny story, about that. Hadn't even been there yet, either! Woulda liked to have seen it!"<p>"Well, there's still Europe!" Nabiki quickly supplied in a chipper voice bordering on hysterical, "There are a few places I can personally suggest visiting! England alone-"<p>"I was going to have to skip Europe, actually... I kind of got into a real mess back in '42 there. Truthfully, you would think they would forget that sort of thing..."<p>"Austrailia's a nice... VAST country to explore!" Nabiki hastefully suggested, beginning to sweat a little. This fact didn't seem to go unnoticed by Ranma.<p>"Hey, Nabiki, you feeling okay?"<p>"Ah..." Happosai smiled, weakly.<p>"Th-there has to be SOMEWHERE you can go!" Nabiki sputtered, desperate to send Happosai anywhere else but within two or three thousand kilometers of herself. As pleasant as it actually was to see the old pervert in a strictly remeniscing sense, he had more than overstayed his welcome for enough lifetimes with her.<p>Happosai's smile grew, "There's no place like home, you know that, Nabiki-dear?"<p>Nabiki slammed her head into the table, and groaned half out of pain, half out of misery. At the moment, she really, REALLY wished she had put cyanide into that bottle of wine.<p>Ranma quickly approached Nabiki, and put her hand on the small of the older woman's back, "Yo, Nabiki. Nabiki?"<p>Nabiki only responded with several non-intelligable comments. Of course, anyone with an imagination would be rather sure of what she had said.<p>"Whelp, now that that's settled, who wants to watch this movie I picked up?" Happosai enquired, reaching into his outfit, and pulling out a DVD, "ah... whoops... that one I got for you, Nabiki-dear..." Happosai tossed it onto the table, causing it to slide into her arm. Nabiki refrained from raising her head in curiosity.<p>The cover had assuradly caught Shampoo's attention, {Texas Rodeo Beefshow...}. Texas seems like an interesting place..." Nabiki didn't look up, as she deftly plucked the DVD from Shampoo's fingers, and hid it under herself.<p>So far, in less than a day, she's been completely humbled, shocked, despairing, and most recently humiliated. If she ran, she could make it to her room before anything else could happen.<p>"Hello! I apologise for letting myself in, but everyone seemed preoccupied."<p>"YOWSA! It's an old ghoul!"<p>"Interesting, it's a decrepid moron," Cologne responded in kind, before deciding to ignore the presence of the quickly identifiable idiot. "I trust today has been an eventful day for all involved?" She cast a meaningful glance to Shampoo, who cowled, sheepishly.<p>"Yes, yes it has, actually," Nabiki quipped, before bringing herself to stand, "If you don't mind, I think I will retire early tonight."<p>"But it's only three," Ranma supplied.<p>"It's late enough."<p>"Yes, it has become rather late for things, hasn't it?" Cologne added, which Shampoo understood plainly where the comment was directed to.<p>With a deep breath, Shampoo gave the departing Nabiki an apologetic smile, "Sorry, Nabiki?"<p>"For what?" Nabiki responded, unfortunately not following her intuition that told her just to keep walking. She turned around, just in time to see Shampoo lock lips with Ranma, in female form, no less.<p>"To you, I devote myself, beloved" Shampoo vowed, though not with any sincere emotion."<p>"Hmph, I guess that would have to do," the Amazon Matriarch sighed.<p>Yes, this would most assuradly make the day perfect. And with that, Nabiki closed her eyes, and allowed darkness to envelope her.
