</div>'Older'<p>Ranma stared at the two boxes of chocolates laying on his floor. For the last hour, they have been the only things that have occupied his mind. He had gotten them two days ago, and thought it was a reletively simple ordeal; just give them to Nabiki, and be done with it. It wasn't like they were chocolate on White Day or something, it didn't mean anything but a simple thanks. He could at least hand her the box she had already paid for, but then again that would raise too many questions he was sure he couldn't come up with plausable answers to.<p>Ranma glowered at the box of confectioneries, he should have just considered a simple handshake before he traveled all over Japan and shelled out money.<p>At the time, it sounded like a great idea. Nabiki was always harking on how cherry cordials were the kami's gift to the sugartooth to the point where he suspected there was a shrine presenting such in her bedroom.<p>"She's gonna read too much into this, I just know she is," Ranma replied, placing his chin in his hand.<p>"Read into what, Ranma?"<p>"ACK!"<p>_<p>Nabiki blinked at the other side of the door at Ranma's startled shout, and then blushed; it wasn't hard for her to figure out what a young teenage boy would be spending an hour in his room doing. "Ah... I'm not interrupting anything... am I?" Nabiki winced, and thought silently to herself, "Oh, that was a good one Nabiki Tendou..."<p>"Ah... n-no," Ranma's voice sounded from the other side of the door, as the sound of fabric being rustled followed his voice, "just gimme a sec, alright?"<p>"I... um, I can come... er... if you need a little more time... I MEAN if you need your privacy... let me just shut up now..."<p>"What Nabiki do in front of Ranma door?" Shampoo enquired, standing at the top of the staircase.<p>The older woman jumped, extremely startled by the Amazon's sudden appearance. "NOTHING! I was just leaving, really!" Nabiki quickly replied, bracing herself against the door.<p>"Shampoo out there?" Ranma's voice called out, he thought that even if her advise got him into the situation, she may have an idea or two to rectify it.<p>"What Ranma want?" Shampoo replied with the faintest hint of curiosity.<p>Nabiki baulked. The fact that Ranma was in there... doing something private, and she was at his door would not look too good on observation, "Why don't you wait till he finishes his business before you talk to him?"<p>"It's alright Nabiki, I'm finished," Ranma replied with a slight tone of relief. Nabiki turned to look back at the door, feeling guilty for interrupting him; poor guy.<p>"Let's give you some time first. You know the air outside is pretty fresh, why don't you open up a window?"<p>Shampoo blinked. "What you talk about?" Ranma mirrored her question in tangent from the other side. Nabiki almost groaned, wondering exactly how dense two teenagers could be at a hint, not that she really wanted Shampoo to realize what she was implying, of course.<p>Forgetting the question, Shampoo approached the door, "You talk to me, yes, Ranma?"<p>"You can talk later! I need to speak to you for a second, Shampoo!" Nabiki quickly interjected, just as the door swung in, causing her to lose the surface her back was braced against. "Hiiii!"<p>"Whoa, you okay, Nabiki?" Ranma enquired, holding the older woman by the waist before she had fully collapsed backwards onto the ground.<p>Nabiki blinked, and felt her cheeks burning, just as Shampoo stepped through the threshold. Instinctually, her hands clasped over Ranma's arms, not to remove them, but to ensure they didn't let go... suddenly let go... and drop her. That didn't explain the blush forming, though.<p>"Nabiki?"<p>"OH! Um, I'm fine, I'm fine!" the middle aged woman replied, quickly pulling herself back upright, almost regretfully, "Just stumbled, that's all."<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow, before favoring Nabiki with a hooded gaze, "That's what you get for leaning against the door. Any reason you were blocking Shampoo?"<p>Before Nabiki could speak, she noted the absense of any embarrassing oders. Either her imagination flew off with her, or Ranma could clean up pretty quickly. "Ranma,what were you doing in here?"<p>"N-nutt'n," Ranma said, evasively, as he shifted nervously. Nabiki decided that she should best let the whole thing slide.<p>"I wanted to ask you something, but I'll let you and Shampoo talk," Nabiki changed the subject, heading out the room, "Oh, and take your time." The last comment was said with a playful wink, just before the woman dashed from the door.<p>Ranma rolled his eyes, "She's still trying to fix us up, isn't she?"<p>"She no very hiding of fact, yes?" Shampoo replied, staring after Nabiki with a half-lidded stare.<p>"Like you're one to talk," Ranma accused, glaring at Shampoo.<p>"What Ranma problem?" Shampoo snapped; not even a minute and he was already getting on her nerves.<p>"What the Hell am I supposed to do with this?" Ranma enquired heatedly, as he lifted his bedmat to display two boxes of cherry cordials he had stashed when Nabiki was at his door.<p>Shampoo blink, blinked a second time, and then leaned over to pat Ranma on the head a couple of times. "Back at village, I be nice to too, too special children, is true!"<p>"Oh, cut the crap!" Ranma replied, slapping her hand away, "You know I can't give this to Nabiki without her getting weird ideas!"<p>Shampoo tilted her head, "What weird ideas?"<p>"Y-you know, the ones you girls usually get when a guy gives you stuff."<p>Shampoo stared, before she realized what Ranma was trying to imply, "Is idea, yes?"<p>"NO! THAT IS NOT THE IDEA!" Ranma shouted.<p>"Everything okay up there?" Nabiki called up, sounding concerned.<p>"Sorry, Nabiki," Ranma replied, before turning back to Shampoo, "Why in the world do I want Nabiki fawning all over me?"<p>Shampoo shook her head, deciding she just didn't understand the boy in front of her, "You is pervert boy, is true?"<p>"I ain't a pervert!" Ranma nearly growled, "That's the whole point!"<p>Shampoo ignored the added commentary, "So, you no like other boys?"<p>"NO I DON'T LIKE OTHER BOYS!"<p>"That's good to hear," Nabiki's voice called up.<p>Ranma glared out his door, but chose not to comment, "Shampoo, she's already all over me, I don't need to encourage her further!"<p>"And you is too, too full of youself." Shampoo turned away, folding her arms, "You ask Shampoo for advise, I give. You choose follow Shampoo advise, and then is thinking no finish what you started. Shampoo cannot help coward! Is no Amazon way!"<p>Ranma's mood darkened even further, "I'm not a coward..."<p>"Shampoo know two reasons why Ranma is!" To emphesize her point, she lifted the bedding, and pointed to two thin boxes hidden underneath it.<p>"That has nothing to do with me being-"<p>"You afraid what Nabiki think, when Ranma no have reason to be afraid. If no be coward, Shampoo no understand Japanese."<p>"That's right, you DON'T understand Japanese!" Ranma retorted, jumping on the opening, "Check this, Nabiki's a friend ONLY! I'm not dating any girl right now, much less one that's older than my own mother!"<p>"Then Japanese is stupid," Shampoo countered, "No make sense you ignore feeling for Nabiki because you is no same age!"<p>"But I DON'T have feelings for her!" Ranma argued, vehemantly. "You're presuming just because we're nice to each other that we should be a couple! That's not the way things work, no matter how much you seem to want them to!"<p>"Ranma know even know if have feelings for Nabiki, because keep running away when given oppor... opp-, when given chance! You is like Mousse! He think Shampoo give him time of day, that I is loving with him. He think he in love with Shampoo, because he scared of what truly Shampoo feel for him!"<p>Shampoo pointed at Ranma, accusingly, "You is no different, but instead of trying to make Nabiki love you, you push Nabiki away, act if she no look at you, and you no look at her when thinking she no see. Shampoo see, stupid boy! Get stupid grin sometime, too! If Ranma is REAL mans, Ranma talk to Nabiki, find out how she feel!"<p>Ranma blinked, "Who's Mousse?"<p>Shampoo closed her eyes, and produced her bonbori. After a seconds thought, she put them away, turned on her heel, and started out the room, "Shampoo give up, you is too, too hopeless."<p>"Whoever this Mousse guy is..." Ranma started in a calm voice, "Don't you think you're doing the same thing with me and Nabiki that he's trying to do with you and him?"<p>"Is different," Shampoo replied, coldly. She wasn't happy to be compared with Mousse, "I know I no is in love Mousse."<p>"And that's the difference," Ranma replied distainfully, "You know how you feel about the jerk..." Ranma turned to look down at his bedding, which had too recognizable lumps under it, "But you have no idea how I'm feeling."<p>Shampoo left the room, but spoke from the hall, "Ranma no know how he feel, either."<p>Ranma shook his head, deciding Shampoo just had brain damage. Out of options for the moment, Ranma went downstairs, deciding to head for the backyard for some practice. Nabiki was sitting on the couch, but for once, not watching TV, playing a videogame, or listening to music.<p>"Ah, Nabiki, you had something to talk to me about?" Ranma enquired, remembering her previous stop to his room.<p>"Don't worry about it, Ranma," Nabiki replied in a lazy tone, as she attempted to sink herself further into the comfort of her favorite couch.<p>"Um, you sure?" Ranma replied, curious as to what she wanted.<p>"Yes, Ranma," Nabiki replied in a slightly agitated tone.<p>"Alright, then," Ranma shrugged, and headed for the back door. He paused, going rigid, and after a few moments, broke into a faster stride for the door.<p>"It's not like you have any feelings for me," Nabiki whispered under her breath, not catching the way Ranma abruptly had come to a stop.<p>_<p>Ranma had only been practicing for an hour, before he quit. It wasn't from any lack of vitality or that he had even accomplished anything, he simply didn't have his heart in it, and as his father often told him, if your mind, heart, and spirit were not part of training, you may as well throw in the towel. Ranma was far from considering quitting the art, but for this instance, he decided that it wasn't worth the wasted effort.<p>This time, it wasn't simply some unidentifiable problem with Nabiki that he would have to dig for the proper course of action, it was point blank in front of him in bold print. Because of that, Ranma couldn't simply ignore the situation, and honor as a man demanded he rectify the situation.<p>He knew what he meant, but he was certain that his host took his statement out of context. He wasn't head over heels in love with her, as Shampoo accused. Nabiki was a friend, one of the closest he had ever had, but that didn't change the fact that he wasn't... romantically inclined towards her. Nonetheless, he could assume the worst from how she's acted in the past; and it wasn't something he really wanted to go through again.<p>Upsetting Nabiki, quite frankly, made him feel like a heel, even if he were in the right or wrong, wether it was unintentional or not. How to fix the problem? Apologise. At the thought, pride warred with his concern; he hadn't done anything genuinely wrong, and it was Nabiki's fault for reading too much into what he had said. But, Ranma recalled something his father had said to him, one of the many lessons of life that his father tried to impart to his son. Granted, the majority of those lessons tended to be severely wrong, but current evidense was giving too much support to this simple fact; when it comes to women, it's *always* your fault.<p>"Nabiki, you jerk," Ranma mumbled, before looking up and ensuring that no one had heard him. Sighing in resignation, the pigtailed martial artist went back into the house. "Hey, Nabiki?"<p>No reply. Ranma hadn't heard her car at any time, so didn't think she had gone anywhere. A brief search through the living room and dining room didn't turn up her whereabouts, prompting him to call out once more. Still, he went unanswered, in turn enticing him to continue searching. Her bedroom door was closed, and he brought his hand up to knock, stopping just as he heard noise from another room attached to the downstairs hall.<p>Nabiki's home office, that's where he found her, pouring her concentration over a thin stack of papers. After a moment's pause, Ranma decided that he wouldn't get a moment's peace of mind until he had resolution, "Hey, Nabiki?"<p>The woman looked up from behind thin wire framed reading glasses. Once she noted Ranma's presence, she removed them, and glanced at him with oblivious expectancy, "Yes, Ranma?"<p>For a few moments, Ranma fought with what he wanted to say, "I just wanted to say that... I don't have all that many friends, and you've been pretty nice about this whole thing with me staying here and all when you really didn't have to, you know?"<p>Nabiki blinked, before nodding, putting her glasses back on, and starting through the document she already had in hand, "It's the least I can do, Ranma."<p>"But you still didn't have to do it," Ranma replied, finding his rebuke coming easily, "I mean, even though you say we're... friends, this has been a bit out of the way for you, don't you think?"<p>"Well, I was pretty obligated, thanks to the mess our fathers left us in," Nabiki commented, switching to the next paper, after sticking the one she had been reading into a manilla folder.<p>Ranma shirked back at the reply, "'Obligated'?"<p>With a sigh, Nabiki looked up at the pigtailed young man, "Ranma, I have quite a bit of work I need to get done for tomorrow, okay?"<p>Not sure if his subtle inquiry was intentionally dodged or not, Ranma nodded slightly, "I'm getting pretty hungry now. I'll go make us some dinner, then."<p>"Don't bother, Shampoo was going to be bringing a few things that her great-grandmother wants us to try to get our opinions on," the older woman stated, "If you feel the need to do so, get something to snack on until she gets back."<p>"..., alright," Ranma replied. Instead of getting something to curtail his appetite, he headed upstairs to his room. The previous conversation left Ranma feeling extremely unsettled. He was anticipating her acting evasive and being more than slightly irritable. Instead, she seemed almost... indifferent.<p>He found her reaction more than diconcerting, since he wasn't sure how he stood with her. She was obviously mad about what she had overheard him say, right? So why wasn't she pointadly ignoring him, expressing extreme irritation at his presence, and in short, giving him enough attitude to make his own life Hell?<p>Maybe she wasn't as upset as he presumed she would be. He always thought her previous reactions to his imagined slights were a bit over the top; perhaps she had realized that it wasn't practical or proper to go off the deepend.<p>"Heh, it's about time she realized that," Ranma said to himself without much mirth. Having nothing else to do, Ranma pulled out a book from his schoolpack, and decided that if he was going to waste time, may as well do it schoolwork.<p>_<p>Shampoo hadn't heard her Great-grandmother say anything more to her than bark instructions; retrieve this for her, stir this, keep an eye on that, and the like. From the tone being used for said directions, the young Amazon could easily tell that she had reached the end of her stall period. Cologne was terse, and had barely turned her glance to her heir. What glimpses Shampoo had recieved, she could not decipher how irritated the matriarch was from her expression.<p>Ever since she had left Nabiki's in order to assist her great-grandmother for the evening, she had felt the tension mounting up. It was obviously intended by her elder relative, to be certain, and it would continue until Cologne felt the moment was proper, and Shampoo had suffered enough to be sincere in her answers. Well, Shampoo was taught by the very same woman to be able to withstand pressure of any sort. If she was going to crack her great-granddaughter's will, it wouldn't be without extreme effort.<p>Cologne had to admit, the stoic and slightly oblivious expression Shampoo wore was holding pretty well. Alas, the elder Amazon was growing impatient. For a month, Shampoo had not accomplished any of her obligational tasks. The first one, to kill the redheaded outsider, was not really one Cologne wanted, since she didn't truly feel her great-granddaughter was ready for such a lofty responsibility. Even if their laws demanded it, the deed was not one that could be so flippantly accomplished. Unfortunately, Shampoo was far too brash at the time of the challenge to consider consequences of her pride and actions.<p>The second one, to marry the boy named Ranma, was much more preferred to the former option. It technically wasn't what their laws demanded, but it provided a loophole that would not cause a waste in such great potential she found in her own blood heir and the heir to the Saotome school of Martial Arts. The grand act of vengence would put Shampoo on emotionally unstable ground, which in turn would reflect in her performance and training, while Ranma would simply be lost as the final branch of that particular sect of the Saotome line.<p>She was well aware that Shampoo was stalling in her current task, just as Cologne was. The matriarch had enough ground to justify her lengthy stay away from the village; it wasn't exactly like she was essential, after all. But, eventually they would inquire as to why she felt the need to stay abroad. Cologne wasn't about to lie about the situation, since it wasn't nearly as dire as Shampoo probably believed it to be, but it was serious enough to warrent punishment.<p>"How goes things with you and son-in-law?" Cologne asked, finally bringing the underlying reason for Shampoo's presence to the fore.<p>"Ranma, he is a hard boy to contend with," Shampoo replied, evasively.<p>"Japanese, Shampoo," Cologne chided sternly, "and that is not what I asked."<p>"I..." Shampoo didn't face her elder, "I no know what do with Ranma. He confuse Shampoo."<p>Cologne almost wanted to laugh, "Nonsense. Even for Japanese, the boy is rather easy to anticipate. Give him attention, and he'll direct his towards you. i'm well aware you know this, Shampoo, so I ask again, what is your progress with the boy?"<p>Wincing at being cornered, Shampoo replied, "Shampoo... I no get far."<p>"Shampoo," Cologne started, sighing, "I don't believe the task is too much for you, so that leads me to believe you're directly going against my commandment."<p>"Is complicated, everything too, too complicated," Shampoo attempted to argue, hoping that her response would at least temporarily quell her elder.<p>"If things have become that problmatic, then perhaps it is time I intervined?"<p>"Is no necessary, Great-grandmother," Shampoo replied, quickly.<p>Cologne rolled her eyes, Shampoo was far from clever about these things, and was well too prone to panic, "If you feel that to be the case. Although I give this warning, I can't stay my hand for too much longer."<p>Shampoo bowed, attempting to hide her nervousness, "Understand, Great-grandmother."<p>Cologne smiled, "Good then. Please take these dishes with you back to Ms. Tendou's. Hers and Ranma's opinions would be most valued."<p>_<p>"The values of the stocks are at a seventeen percent gain at the moment, and our analysts do not forsee a decline in the near future, with the projects being invested in currently are essential ones, even holding strong support by both the Japanese and Korean goverments. Don't expect this value to continue throughout the rest of the fiscal year, and I advise that you continue your level of investment until we actually do see it begin to cool off, at least."<p>"That is... promising," Mr. Isawo replied, not all that interested in hearing what he had already known. He tended to keep tabs on the market, and at many times was able to supply Nabiki with information she may not have gotten for a couple of days following, "Ms. Tendou, as usual, everything is proceeding as they should be. Each time I visit, you most assuradly reaffirm my decision of approaching you for my financial reorganizing."<p>"Glad to be of help," Nabiki replied, still looking over the reports, before glancing up, indifferently, "Would you like me to continue?"<p>"Oh, I don't think it would be necessary," the man replied, standing up from his seat at the other side of the desk. "If I recall, I originally selected this day for our appointments because I would be the only one you had to contend with."<p>"You said that you preferred it that way, so I would be sole focused on your affairs," Nabiki reminded, recalling her irritation at the lack of confidence Mr. Isawo had shown in her back then. The man wasn't used to contending with women handling such major personal affairs. At the time, Nabiki had thought, with no small satisfaction, that if a woman had handled his money for him, he wouldn't require her assistance.<p>Mr. Isawo chuckled, "I guess that is correct, my apologies for my past impudence. I also would like to enquire if I am still your sole appointment on this day?"<p>"Yes, you are," Nabiki replied, somewhat curious to the enquiry. She mainly handled her new clientelle to the staff she had under her, only taking on a new case when she lost one of her older clients.<p>"I see, I would suspect that makes getting any other work you have today done, am I correct?" the fifty-year old man questioned, as he surrupticiously walked around the desk.<p>"Actually, I'll probably sit in the office twidling my thumbs in the off-chance one of my clients call, or one of my employees need an inquiry answered," Nabiki replied, all while wiping any trace of emotion from her face, and becoming more guarded.<p>Mr. Isawo nodded, "Then your presence is not largely required for the rest of the day?" He was now standing on the same side of the desk that Nabiki was sitting at, while seeming to focus his attention out the window behind her.<p>Nabiki watched his hand come to rest on the back of her chair, and shifted slightly away from it, "No, I wouldn't think so."<p>"Then perhaps you would allow me to take you out for lunch? My way of showing my appreciation for all that you've assisted me with in the past few years."<p>Nabiki turned back to her desk, and put Mr. Isawo's reports into the folder she had out, "That won't be necessary, Mr. Isawo, although I appreciate your offer."<p>If Nabiki's client didn't know the woman better, he would have sworn she just grew... colder, "Please, Ms. Tendou, allow this humbled man a way to express his gratitude. I believe I would be rather lost without the help you've provided."<p>No...thank you," Nabiki replied, still not looking towards him as she put the folder into her desk. Her reply was sharp, and brooked no argument.<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Isawo had resolved that today he would make his approach on the woman. He found her remarkable and intriguing; someone he would like to know more personally. "I apologise if I seemed a bit persistant. Would you allow me to keep you company for a little while?"<p>"I had believed you decided to end this appointment," Nabiki replied, finally looking at the man with an expression of indifference.<p>Mr. Isawo shirked at the glance, "Is... is there something wrong, Ms. Tendou?"<p>"Mr. Isawo," Nabiki began, folding her hands in front of her, "As flattered as I am, I'm afraid that anything beyond business and passing familiarity would be a compromise on my job. I would rather have you as a client and a possibly more than a passing aquaintance than approach the notion of a relationship, as I'm currently... 'not on the market'."<p>Frank and curt; Mr. Isawo was rather startled by that. He mentally reviewed everything they had said, and didn't find any fault with himself, "I see, then I apologise."<p>"Don't worry about it too much," Nabiki replied, standing up, and walking to the door, "My reasons for my decisions are in no relation to you. It wasn't anything you said or did." Nabiki opened it, signalling that it was time for her client to leave.<p>"Ah, then I hope you are able to resolve these troubling issues you're currently preoccupied with," the man replied, giving Nabiki a nod for a bow. "I will see you the same time, next week."<p>"And as usual, I'll have everything prepaired," Nabiki replied, bowing back. She watched her client walk down the hall to the elevator, before closing her door, and walking back to her desk.<p>_<p>"Ranma, you're spacing out again."<p>"Oh, what were you saying?" the pigtailed martial artist replied, glancing towards the boy next to him.<p>"Man, the only time I see you awake much is at lunch, and now you're off in space during this time!" Ranma's classmate commented, "What's up?"<p>"Ah, it's nothing, just thinking about things."<p>"Well, let me give you something else to think about. See that girl over there? The one with the copper highlights?"<p>Ranma glanced in the general direction the other boy was motioning to, before returning to his food, "What about her?"<p>"You *do* realize she's been trying to get your attention for the last few days, right?"<p>Ranma shrugged, "She's asked me about a few things. Guessed she was interested in studying martial arts."<p>"Man, you're not really that dense, are you? She's probably practically asked you to teach her!"<p>"She has, actually."<p>"Oh... you said no, didn't you?"<p>"Not really the teaching type," Ranma responded, before taking a bite of his noon meal.<p>"Man, what's with you? I mean, that's like the third girl I've known to approach you, and you turned her down flat!"<p>Ranma sighed, realizing the conversation wasn't going to be dropped. Worse yet, several other boys and a few girls had begun to listen in, "She's, um, not my type."<p>"Man, she's ANY hetero-guy's type!" Another boy stated, subtly implying Ranma's preference.<p>"What's the deal Saotome? You're pickier than most girls I know! I swear you must become one or something!" Ranma's classmate blinked, as the pigtailed martial artist began to choke. Helpfully, a couple of girls quickly came to the assist, gently patting him on the back, while a third opted to attempt the Heimlech maneuver in a none too subtle attempt to get her arms around him.<p>"I'm alright, I'm alright," Ranma consoled, waving the two girls off, "Just something down the wrong pipe."<p>"What the heck is wrong with Yumi, though?" the first classmate Ranma had been conversing with enquired, "At least give a reason!"<p>"Ah, she's alright, I guess," Ranma commented, careful about taking another bite, "It's just the way she gushes over things, and acts like everythings just so adorable. I dunno, seems like she just needs to grow up a bit."<p>"Ranma, if she grew up anymore, she would be having some severe back problems."<p>"She ain't the only one that needs to grow up," Ranma retorted, before taking a drink from his can of peach juice, while glaring sideways at the other boy. He finished his gulp, and set the can down, "Think about anything else than a girl's figure?"<p>"Ranma, it's the first thing most normal guys notice!" Ranma's classmate replied, rolling his eyes.<p>"Well, I think it's sweet!" A girl standing across from where Ranma was sitting commented, as she reached over to clasp his hand, "It's nice to know that there are guys in the world like you... Ranma." Her thoughts were that not only was Ranma the greatest hunk to come under the tender age of sixteen, he was a chivelrous and considerate hunk as well.<p>Since these were her thoughts, they weren't on the half-full can of peach juice sitting at the edge of the desk.<p>Everyone that had been sitting around Ranma blinked, and blinked again, before the incredulous and surreal episode that just took place before them registered. As one, they all then turned to look up at the ceiling to find Ranma clinging to it tightly, while staring down wide-eyed at the spilled soda.<p>"Whoa," one boy commented, "no matter how many times I see him do that..."<p>"Yeah, what reflexes!"<p>_<p>Nabiki sat in her office,at her desk, keeping her hands folded together under her chin. It wasn't the first time she had felt bored at work, and would far be the last. The difference, this time, was the great sense of disinterest towards pretty much anything she currently felt. Nothing she felt like indulging in, nothing she could think of that would provide even a slight amount of entertainment, nothing to help alleviate the haze of meloncholy that came with it all.<p>Taking a deep breath and exhaling, she turned to look outside to find it amidst a light drizzle. Though the rain wasn't anywhere near torrentuous, the dark gray clouds helped to further sether mood.<p>Nabiki wondered if Ranma made it around safely without having to deal with his curse, but forcefully dismissed the thought by turning herself from the scene, and looking up at the clock. The boy could take care of himself, he obviously didn't need her concern. Let someone else worry about him, like his mother. Of course, she realized, Nodoka didn't know of his curse, so a slight of rain wouldn't concern her about her manly son.<p>Turning sideways in her swivel base chair so that her legs were against her desk rather than under it, Nabiki looked sideways out the window. It was getting a bit heavier, what a surprise. As her luck would have it, she had forgotten her umbrella at home. hopefully it would let up, what with her wearing a light blouse with her light blue lingerie. Well, why should she care if gave a few perverts a slight show? It wasn't as if there was going to be any guy in her life to defend her honor, and it wasn't like she couldn't do it herself. Then again, her clothing most likely wouldn't leave much tothe imagination if properly drenched... the rain just got even heavier, oh joy.<p>She cursed her stupidity for not checking the weather report before picking her outfit; her attire would just practically be challenging the deities and tempting fate. Well, she lost that challenge. Maybe she could ask one of the staff to borrow theirs? Of course, she already knew of a couple of guys in the office who would jump at the chance. Even if she didn't ask them, they would find out, and be persistant in their offer.<p>Rubbing her forehead while crossing her legs, Nabiki decided that she really didn't want to deal with those morons right now. Sometimes men were like little children, trying to impress everyone that caught their interest with their new toys, the neat stunts and tricks they can do, and how much of a nice boy they can be. Unfortunately, the thing that separates men from children was the lack of innocense.<p>Human nature, and it didn't just fall upon the masculine side of the species. Everyone wanted something for their efforts, even if they weren't truthful to themselves about it. If one just waited long enough, you would find the bare, disturbing reality behind someone's kind smile, their sweet words, and their endearing attentiveness.<p>It was a lot less painful if everything is clarified before things became too personal.<p>_<p>Ranma used to love the rain. When he was on the road, it provided for great cooling after a heavy workout. It was the type of heavy weather he least minded training in, in contrast to a beating sun or abundant snow.<p>Now... even with his curse, he didn't hate it, but he no longer was able to enjoy it as he did before. Well, it wasn't that 'she' couldn't enjoy it, at least, but it also wasn't like Ranma was ever in the mood to be a girl.<p>Most times, of course, there wasn't much of a choice, Ranma realized wryly, as she brushed a few strands of red hair that had plastered to her face. If she had known, she would have taken the bus instead of trying to get home as fast as possible.<p>There wasn't much she could do about it now, and home... Nabiki's house was just in the distance. Without much ground to cover, Ranma was quickly inside, shedding her wet clothes before stepping onto Nabiki's carpeting. Normally, she wouldn't have bothered, but Ranma knew his host took pride in her home, and it wasn't fair to her if she waterlogged the rug.<p>wearing only her boxers, Ranma made it upstairs to her room, and closed the door. putting her wet clothes on the windowstill, the redhead turned to find her bedroll still laid out for some reason. It didn't take her long recall why that was so.<p>Last night, Ranma hadn't even slept in her bed, since she didn't want to remove the two boxes that were hidden under it. Granted, there were other hiding places for them, but Ranma didn't want to risk it.<p>Nabiki should be home, soon. Ranma considered the fact that she was apparently upset with him, and they would make a nice goodwill gift to accompany an apology, as well as thanks. More than likely, she wouldn't read further than what he was crediting the gifts for.<p>Ranma had to admit, though, that she didn't like having Nabiki upset at her, or over anything, period. The pigtailed girl sincerely wanted to be nice to her, since things just seemed a lot better when she was happier. Maybe it was just a bit of selfishness on Ranma's behalf, it did seem a lot like she was just buttering her host up.<p>Ranma blinked at the sudden mental image, "Wha... where did that come from?" Ranma shook her head; she'd been hanging around the perverts at school far too often.<p>Ranma's head perked up at the sound of the front door opening; Nabiki was home early, which meant she probably got bored at work again. She had to admire the woman to be able to do that.<p>"Yo, Nabiki?" Ranma walked to the top of the stairway, waiting for Nabiki to pass by under it.<p>She did so, and only lifted her head slightly to glance up, "Ranma, why are you running around my house, nude?"<p>The redhead blinked, and looked down at herself, "Ah, I'm wearing my boxers."<p>Nabiki sighed, "Ranma, go put some clothes on, and we'll talk about whatever you like, okay?"<p>Ranma had actually wanted to take a nice bath before putting on a new set of clothes, but went to her room to do so, anyhow. "How was your day at work?"<p>"It was work," Nabiki replied, not caring to elaborate.<p>"Um... okay... ah..." Ranma ran into a roadblock in the conversation. Instead of trying to consider something else to talk about, Ranma watched Nabiki while descending the stairs. Ranma could still hear the rain outside, and Nabiki was drenched. She didn't seem aware of the fact, or didn't care, as she tiredly flopped herself onto the couch, and rolled her head back against the back.<p>Ranma shivered at her shuddering sigh, but braved approaching her host, "Bad day, huh?"<p>"I don't really feel like talking about it, alright, Ranma?" Nabiki replied, keeping her eyes closed.<p>Ranma observed Nabiki, leaning over the back of the couch. There was still glistening drops coating her face from the unyeilding rain outside, appearing like sweat and tears upon her fair complextion. A drop splashed from where her bangs were not plastered to her face, landing against her forehead and running down in a slow trek past the subtle swell of her cheek, and down her chin. Ranma just managed to catch herself, just as the redhead's hand was moving to wipe the wetness from the older woman's face.<p>Ranma retracted her hand almost hesitatingly, and looked away, "Nabiki..."<p>"What... is it, Ranma?" the woman replied in a terse voice that held a subtle message that she didn't want to be bothered.<p>At the tone, Ranma felt a bit of shame, "I know I haven't been the best of guests, and I'm sorry 'bout it."<p>"Don't worry about it, Ranma."<p>Regardless of Nabiki's dismissal, Ranma continued. "Just listen, alright? I'm... I'm sorry." The redhead paused, and looked at Nabiki. The older woman kept her eyes closed, but was not interrupting or ignoring the girl.<p>At the silent urge to continue, Ranma did so, "I've never had a friend that... well... did so much, just because it was the right thing to do. it's like you don't do anything for yourself." Ranma took a deep breath, "I didn't mean to upset ya, you know? I say a lot of things in the heat of the moment, but I don't mean them. I don't think I could say anything bad about you, and really mean much from it."<p>By now, Nabiki had opened her eyes, paying rapt attention to the girl, "Ranma...?"<p>"I've... I guess I can be pretty obnoxious when I'm not paying attention, huh?" The redhead asked with a little mirth, "It's just that I always thought that other than the art, life was about getting what was necessary. At least that's what I gathered from Pop. There aren't many people like you around, and I just felt I should say than... hold onna sec..."<p>Nabiki raised her eyebrows, as Ranma suddenly rushed upstairs, returning later with identical pairs of boxes that were very familiar to her. "I just wanted to say, thanks, Nabiki."<p>Nabiki's eyebrows climbed, as she accepted the boxes. For several moments, all she could do was stare at them, before turning a questioning look to Ranma.<p>"Well, I kinda realized I'm the reason for why you're upset, and you don't deserve to be because of something stupid I said, okay? Ah..." Ranma scratched the back of her head, nervously, before turning away, "So, you ain't gonna be mop'n all over the place again, are ya?"<p>"Ranma, I..." Nabiki paused, as she looked back to the chocolates, and then once again to Ranma, "Ranma, thank you. I needed that."<p>Before Ranma got any redder, she replied nonchilantly, before quickly heading upstairs, "It's not a big deal, so don't go overblowing it..."<p>Nabiki stared at the gifts in her hands, listening to the other girl depart. To her, it was a bigger deal than she even wanted to realize.
