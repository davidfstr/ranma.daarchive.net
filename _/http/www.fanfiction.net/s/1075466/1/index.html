</div><p>Disclaimer:  If I owned Ranma I'd been drinking Martini's in the Bahamas, but since I don't I'm stuck up in  the cold, cold Great White North and now on to the Fic.</p><p><u>The Dark  Side of Life</u></p><p>By Bustin</p><p><u>Part 1:  Fall from Grace</u></p><p>Ranma needed it and she needed it now, her body  was aching and the chills were setting in. She felt like the cravings were  going to kill her if she didn't get it soon. Her hands trembled as she heated  the spoon and used the needle to mix the powder until it dissolved into the  water. With as much skill as she could muster, she drew the solution into the  needle.</p><p>Using a piece of cord, she tied off her left  arm, exposing the vain. With a well practiced move she stuck the needle into  the vain and pushed its contents in. A few seconds later the wonderful,  euphoric feeling she needed flowed through her body.</p><p>Slowly she lowered herself down onto her futon  as the good feelings flowed through her body. When she was high her problems no  longer mattered. She didn't care that she had slipped through the cracks of  society and her life had become a living hell. All that mattered was the  heroin.</p><p>As she lay there revelling in her euphoria, the  door to her room flew open and in walked vaguely human shaped image. In her  drug induced fog, she tried to focus in on the image. She gave a goofy smile as  she recognized who it was, Heero her boss.</p><p>Heero sighed and ran a hand through his heavily  greased hair. "Ranma are you too doped up to see a customer or can you handle  it?" he asked forcefully as he scowled down at his stoned up girl.</p><p>Ranma sat up, the goofy grin never leaving her  face. "I c-can handle it Heero, send him in."</p><p>Heero smiled and cupped Ranma's face in his  hand, staring into her seductive blue eyes. "Good, I knew I could count on you,  reliable Ranma. Make sure you show him a good time, he's a good friend and a  good customer."</p><p>"Sure Heero, I'll rock his world," replied a  giggling Ranma.</p><p>"Good I'll send him," said Heero as he headed  towards the door. "Oh and Ranma, if he's not happy, you won't get your next  dose."</p><p>Ranma's colour drained from her face. "I'll do  a good job Heero, I swear!" cried a panicked and fearful Ranma.</p><p>"Good girl, I know you will," replied a  satisfied looking Heero as he left Ranma's room, her reply exactly what he  wanted to hear.</p><p>Ranma could hear voices in the hall, probably  Heero and his friend discussing prices. Her high helped relieve some of the  anxiety she felt over Heero's threat and she adjusted her lingerie and touched  up on her makeup as she waited for the john to come in.</p><p>She didn't have to wait long as a tall,  expensively dressed gaijin with blond hair; probably an American entered the  room. He eyed her body hungrily as he walked towards her.</p><p>"My, my, Heero said you were beautiful, I'm  glad he wasn't exaggerating," stated the gaijin as he moved down beside her.  Slowly he ran his hand across her body, giving her breasts a gentle feel,  enticing a soft moan from Ranma.</p><p>"Let's skip the formalities shall we and get  down to business," softly whispered the gaijin as one of his hands unclasped  Ranma's bra, while the other made its way towards her panties.</p><p>Ranma pressed her body against his and brought  her mouth to his. The kiss was long and deep, with their tongues intertwined.  Slowly she moved her hands to his body and began to pull off his clothing.</p><p>As they progressed, Ranma experienced a moment  of clarity and her mind wandered back to happier times, when she had everything  she ever wanted. She remembered the good times, the bad times, but mostly she  remembered the day she lost everything and the weeks that followed.</p><p>Three years  ago</p><p>It had only been a week since she  had lost everything, and Ranma was in a state of total depression. Her battle with  Herb for the Open Water kettle at Mt. Horaisan had ended in a devastating defeat. Sure  she had defeated herb using the reverse Hiryu Shoten Ha, but she lost where it  really counted. When Ryoga had tossed the kettle to her, the unthinkable  happened; Herb intercepted the kettle with a powerful ki blast, disintegrating  it. Rage had clouded Ranma's vision and she defeated Herb soundly. Afterwards  she collapsed from the shock and realization that she would remain a girl  forever.</p><p>Ryoga and Mousse brought the despondent redhead  back to the Tendo family home. It was a sombre journey and her return home was  not the happy homecoming all had expected when her family heard the unfortunate  news.</p><p>Soun had been a bundle of inconsolable tears  after he heard the news that Ranma was stuck and the schools would never be joined.  Her father hadn't been much better, disappearing soon after her arrival,  leaving her to suffer alone when she needed him the most. Kasumi had tried to  be helpful, trying to cheer her up with the positive points of being female,  but all it accomplished was to depress her further. Nabiki gave no comments or  showed any reaction to the news; instead she only displayed her Ice Queen mask  and stood by silently. Akane's reaction hurt Ranma more then all the others  combined. She wasn't mad, or sad, heartbroken or even disappointed; she just  looked at Ranma with pity, no love, no loss, just pity and that nearly  destroyed Ranma.</p><p>And that brought Ranma to where she was now,  sitting in the dojo depressed and without an ounce of hope, her life was over. She  could never be a true martial artist or the man she wanted to be, but most of  all she could never be Akane's husband and lover. All she was now was a waste  of a human being with no purpose and no hope.</p><p>Nabiki looked in on Ranma as she passed the  dojo on her way to the furo. The sight that lay before her was pretty pathetic;  Ranma curled up on the floor, her eyes red and puffy from a weeks worth of  weeping, clothes and hair dishevelled, she looked awful. Nabiki sighed and  silently cursed herself as she felt her heart strings being pulled at the sight  of a devastated and defeated Ranma. Quietly she entered the dojo and walked  over to Ranma and gave her a gentle tap.</p><p>Slowly Ranma looked up to see who the intruder  was that disturbed her solitary misery. She frowned as she saw who it was. "What  do you want Nabiki?" snapped a bitter Ranma.</p><p>Nabiki took a step back from the venomous Ranma  and tried to calm the angry girl. "Easy Ranma, I just came to talk."</p><p>Ranma's anger deflated quickly. "I'm sorry  Nabiki, it's just…" her voice trailed off as she slumped to the floor, sobbing  quietly as went.</p><p>Uncharacteristically Nabiki sat down and  wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and held her, all the while cursing  herself for giving into her feelings. Nabiki held her for what felt like hours,  until the sobbing girl finally calmed down.</p><p>Sniffing and wiping her tears Ranma sat up, but  her head still hung low. "Thanks Nabiki, I really needed that," said a quiet  Ranma.</p><p>"Don't worry about it, consider it a freebie Ranma."</p><p>"Thanks again Nabiki," replied Ranma, her mood  slightly improved.</p><p>"You know Ranma I had a reason for coming to  talk to you."</p><p>Ranma lifted her head and looked at Nabiki suspiciously.  "What was it?" asked Ranma with some suspicion in her voice.</p><p>"Nothing sinister I promise you," reassured  Nabiki. "I just feel that you need to spend some time away from your problems,  to try to enjoy your life again, even for just a little while."</p><p>"How the hell can I do that Nabiki, when I've  lost everything that's important to me?" cried out Ranma, the tears welling up  in her eyes again.</p><p>"Settle down Ranma, hear me out," urged Nabiki.  Ranma calmed down and sat in rapt attention as Nabiki continued. "There's a  party tonight at the house of a business partner in Juban, her name's Maya and  she's throws a decent party. I'm not going but you could go in my place."</p><p>"Me go to a party, are you nuts?" cried a  disbelieving Ranma.</p><p>"Sure why not, for one night you could just  forget all your worries and enjoy yourself again with a bunch of people who  just want to have fun too. It would do you a world of good to just feel happy  again, so how about it?"</p><p>Ranma sat there in silence and pondered over what  Nabiki had said. Nabiki did make a good point and she had to admit that feeling  good again would be nice. Ranma looked up at Nabiki, her eyes puffy and red but  no longer crying. "Ok I'll go," quietly answered Ranma.</p><p>Nabiki smiled at Ranma's answer. "Good choice  Ranma, you won't regret this. Now come with me." Before Ranma could react,  Nabiki pulled the smaller girl to her feet and dragged her out of the dojo.</p><p>"Where are we going?" asked a confused and  slightly nervous Ranma.</p><p>"To the furo, you can't go to the party looking  like that but don't worry having a bath is just the start," answered a  strangely sincere Nabiki.</p><p>Ranma couldn't help but feel nervous as Nabiki  pulled her into the furo. "What have I gotten myself into?" were last thoughts  as Nabiki closed the door behind them.</p><p>Ranma found Maya's place in Juban easily;  Nabiki's directions were dead on. The place surprised Ranma, it was nicer then she  had expected, whatever Maya's business was she sure was successful.</p><p>As she waited for someone to answer the door,  she shifted her feet nervously as she thought about her appearance. Nabiki had  really done a number on her, when she first looked in the mirror after Nabiki  had finished with the makeover; she was floored at how stunning she looked and  if the looks she got from the men on the train were any indication they thought  so as well. But still her appearance made her uncomfortable.</p><p>The clothes that Nabiki made her wear were too  racy for her liking, like the underwear; being black, silky and provocative it looked  like it belonged on a lingerie model not her. She even had to wear silk  stockings and a garter. Her dress was no better; it was black, made of silk,  too low up top, too high down low and it was too tight all, and the makeup, it  felt like she was wearing a mask. The worst was the high heals that Nabiki  forced on her .They had six inches high and held the distinction of being the  most uncomfortable things she had ever worn. She didn't know why she had let  Nabiki to convince her to wear this stuff. It only made her feel weird.</p><p>"How can women stand these shoes?" thought Ranma  as she tried to wiggle her toes. "Man this was bad idea, I should go home."</p><p>Before she could turn around and make a break  for it, the front door opened. Immediately she was assaulted by a loud wave of  a techno beat and greeted by tall, well dressed young women.</p><p>"Ah, you must be Ranma; Nabiki described you to  a tea. I must say you certainly are a lot prettier then Nabiki described you."</p><p>Ranma face turned red at the compliment, she  wasn't sure how to take it. "Thanks I guess."</p><p>"Well, come on in, the party's not getting any  younger," continued Maya as she ushered Ranma in. The inside of the Maya's  place was even more impressive then the outside and was packed with party goers  dancing, drinking and generally having a good time.</p><p>"I have a few house rules, one don't go in the  master bedroom, only personal guests are allowed in there and two if your going  to have sex, wait your turn and do it in a guest bedroom, I hate it when people  make it on the floor," continued Maya, "Oh by the way, Nabiki said your rather  inexperienced so use these," said Maya as she handed Ranma a package. "Nabiki  said to tell you, No Accidents."</p><p>Ranma's face drained of colour as she realized  what they were, condoms. Her voice caught in her throat as she tried to speak.</p><p>"Well try to have fun Ranma, see you around,"  said Maya as she joined the rest of the party goers, leaving a mortified Ranma  behind.</p><p>"Oh man,  I think I'm way over my head, what am I going to do?" thought Ranma.</p><p>While Ranma stood there in silence, wondering  what to do with the condoms she held, her arm was grabbed and she found herself  in the embrace of some guy. He was big, built like an ox, and his breath  smelled like booze. "Hey I see you came prepared, why don't the two of us go  find some place private and use a couple of those?"</p><p>Ranma was just about to pound the creep when  suddenly the guy was pulled away from her and violently thrown to the floor.  Her 'rescuer' looked down at the creep and made his intentions perfectly clear,  "Get out Kenada or I'll kick the shit out of ya."</p><p>The creep didn't stick around. He took off  before anyone else could do or say anything to him.</p><p>Ranma looked up at her rescuer, an above  averaged looking guy dressed in the latest fashions, a sly smile, greased back  hair and eyes so brown they almost looked black. She was slightly pissed at him  for daring to interfere in her business. "Look guy, thanks for …"</p><p>"Names Heero," interrupted her 'rescuer'.</p><p>"Ok, Heero thanks for helping but …"</p><p>"No need to thank me, I always enjoy helping  out pretty girls," interrupted Heero again. "How about you thank me by dancing  with me for a few songs?"</p><p>"But, but…" Ranma tried to protest but she was  quickly whisked into a dance.</p><p>Ranma hated to admit it, but once  she started to dance she felt a little better. It was kind of fun even if it  was some greasy haired stranger, although he wasn't all that bad. In fact after  awhile she didn't even mind when she and Heero danced together during a slow  song. "Nabiki was right, this is exactly what I needed," thought Ranma.</p><p>After a couple hours of dancing,  Ranma's feet really hurt and she decided she needed a break and collapsed onto  a chair as far away as the dancing as possible. Heero wasn't far behind, almost  acting like Ranma's shadow, sitting down right beside her.</p><p>It wasn't long before he was  barraging her with questions. "So what brings you to the party?"</p><p>Ranma thought about not answering  that question at first, but he had been such a nice guy that she felt almost  compelled to tell him something. "A friend suggested I come, it's supposed to  help we get out of my funk."</p><p>"Has it helped any?" asked a sincere  sounding Heero.</p><p>"I guess a little, but not a whole  lot," answered Ranma, feeling the weight of her depression once again.</p><p>"Maybe I could help you Ranma, all  you have to do is trust me," said a smiling Heero.</p><p>In the back of Ranma's mind alarm  bells were going off, but her current state of mind muted their ringing. "What  do you have in mind?" asked a now curious Ranma.</p><p>"I have something I guarantee will  make you feel better, but you have too come with me to someplace private. I  can't help you in front of all these people."</p><p>Ranma took a step away from Heero,  her face red and full of anger. "There's NO way I'm gonna sleep with you!" she  hissed.</p><p>"No, no Ranma, this doesn't involve  sex at all, in fact some people I've helped say its even better, a miracle cure  for all the hurt in the world but if you're too chicken to come with me, then  so be it," replied Heero casually.</p><p>Ranma's face twisted with repressed  rage when Heero suggested she was 'too chicken' to come with him. "Ranma  Saotome is no coward!" thought Ranma, "Lead on Heero, I'm no chicken."</p><p>"Good, now follow me," replied a  still smiling Heero as he led her into an unoccupied guestroom.</p><p>Ranma sat on the floor of the  guestroom as Heero fiddled with a brief case he had retrieved from somewhere.  'Where's this miracle cure he was talking about?' pondered Ranma.</p><p>She watched as he pulled out what  looked to be a pipe, kind of like Happosai's from the brief and filled it with something  from a little baggy. Ranma shifted nervously, wondering if she should of  trusted Heero as much as she had.</p><p>A few minuets later he brought the  pipe over and handed it to her. "Now Ranma, put the pipe in your mouth, and  when I light it, breath deeply, okay?"</p><p>Ranma hesitated; this whole  situation didn't feel right at all.</p><p>"Are you scarred Ranma, don't worry  its not going to hurt you."</p><p>At Heero's prodding Ranma brought  the pipe to her mouth and inhaled deeply as Heero instructed. There was no way  she was going to be a coward.</p><p>She coughed a little as she inhaled  the smoke. She didn't feel anything; she knew he was full shit.</p><p>As if sensing her thoughts, Heero  encouraged her to keep smoking.</p><p>After ten minuets, Ranma began to  feel weird. She felt really, really good, an intense feeling, a rush of euphoria  engulfed her whole body. She couldn't remember the last time she felt this  good, in fact she didn't even think she ever felt this good. It was the best  feeling she had ever had. She felt warm all over and the feelings of pleasure  that flowed throughout her body seemed to melt away all of her negative emotion  and cloud her thinking.</p><p>"You like it?" asked a strangely  smug Heero.</p><p>"Oh yea, it's great," replied a  spaced out Ranma.</p><p>"How would you like to keep the pipe  then, I could also give a few free samples for you to try, how would you like  that?" asked Heero, putting a few little baggies of powder into Ranma's hands.</p><p>"That'd be great," replied Ranma not  really paying attention as she took another drag on the pipe.</p><p>"Good, very good, Why don't you take  my number too Ranma, so you can get in touch if you need me, okay?" suggested,  more like ordered Heero as he wrote his number on slip of paper and placed it  in Ranma's hands as well.</p><p>"Sure Heero," replied Ranma as she  slowly sunk to the floor, her body feeling heavier and heavier.</p><p>"Good, I'll see you around Ranma and  don't forget the free samples," Heero reminded as he confidently slicked back  his greased hair and left the room, leaving a high Ranma alone in the room.</p><p>Ranma lay on the floor, basking in the  good feelings of the comfortable glow, until she became too drowsy and fell  asleep, clutching the pipe to her chest. She had started down the pass less  taken, a journey that would leave her world and those who she had cared about  forever changed.</p><p>Heero left the party with a  satisfied grin on his face; he knew he could always count on Maya. Her parties  were always a great source of fresh income, from the hipsters and wannabes  wanting to try the latest thing, to the down and out that were always so easy  to hook when they were vulnerable. All he had to do was give her a discount and  he could hit up on any of the guests he wanted too and tonight's catch was  certainly worth the half off he gave Maya. That Ranma was definitely a prize  catch and now all he had to do was real her in.</p><p>With a spring in his step, he made  his way to his car; a brand new Honda Coupe parked a few houses down from Maya's,  where he was greeted by a familiar face, Kenada.</p><p>"Hey Heero, how'd it go man?" asked  Kenada, casually leaning against Heero's car, holding a half smoked joint.</p><p>"Went like a charm my man, you  picked a great one and your act was dead on. She spent the whole evening with  me and trusted me enough to smoke some junk I gave her when she didn't even  know what it was, man I tell you Kenada she'll be hooked in a week. Gimmie a  toke, man."</p><p>"That's great man, when she's desperate I want  to fuck her first, I want to see if that red hair of hers is natural," replied  Kenada as he handed Heero the joint.</p><p>"You and me both man, but I got to  tell ya if you want to fuck her first it'll cost ya Kenada," stated Heero  before he took a drag.</p><p>"Bull shit, I found her so I should  have a free go," countered Kenada.</p><p>"Well, will cross that hurdle when  we get too it. Let's say we go get some tail, not fucking her when she was  stoned out of her mind has given me a case of blue balls."</p><p>"I hear ya man, lets fuck that new  girl ya got, the one from Juban."</p><p>"You mean Ami, Kenada?" asked Heero  while passing back the joint.</p><p>"Yea that's the one, lets go before  she starts her shift, I like um better when their clean."</p><p>"Sure but clean is gonna cost ya," joked  Heero as he opened the car door and climbed in.</p><p>"Shut the fuck up and drive you  cheap bastard," laughed Kenada as he got in the passenger seat.</p><p>"Sure thing man, let the night  begin!" yelled Heero, putting the car into gear and screeching off into the  night.</p><p>Ranma left shortly after she woke  up, a cheerful smile never leaving her face and the gifts from Heero safely  tucked away in a purse that Maya had loaned her. She thought it was strange to  carry the stuff hidden in a purse instead of just carrying it out but she had reluctantly  agreed to use the purse on Maya's insistence. She was also confused as to why  she had to keep the stuff Heero gave her a secret from her family, but Maya had  been very persistent on that one, saying that Nabiki and the others wouldn't  understand and would probably take the stuff away.  Well if keeping a harmless little secret from  them was the price she had to pay, so be it. What Nabiki and the others didn't  know wouldn't hurt them.</p><p>Ranma arrived home and went straight  to the dinning room, hoping to find some breakfast. Upon entering the dinning  room, she found Kasumi humming away as she cleaned up the breakfast mess.</p><p>"Why hello Ranma-chan, you look happy  this morning, did you had a good time with your friends?" inquired Kasumi, her  cheerful smile further brightening Ranma's mood.</p><p>"Sure did Kasumi-chan, I had more  fun last night then I ever thought possible," answered," replied Ranma, beaming  with confidence and happiness that Kasumi hadn't seen in awhile.</p><p>"Any  breakfast left Kasumi?" asked Ranma as she kneeled down at the dinner table,  her stomach rumbling, making itself known again.</p><p>"Why yes Ranma, with your Father gone…"  Kasumi's voice trailed off when she saw the look of pain on Ranma's face at the  mention of her father. "Oh my, I'm sorry Ranma, I wasn't thinking."</p><p>"Don't be, It's not your fault, it's my idiot  fathers, but I'm not gonna let <i>him</i>  get to me," strongly spoke Ranma, her face full of determination. Ranma's  features softened as her thoughts turned away from her father and back to her  stomach. "How about that breakfast, K-chan?"</p><p>"It's going to be a few minuets Ranma-chan; I  have to reheat it for you. Why don't you go up and see Nabiki-chan, she  mentioned that she wanted to talk to you."</p><p>"Sure thing Kasumi," replied Ranma.</p><p>Kasumi smiled as she watched the redhead almost  skip out of the dinning room. "It's so nice seeing her happy again, Nabiki's  advice seems to have helped the poor girl," thought Kasumi, her smile never  fading. "Maybe now she can start excepting who she now is and start living  again."</p><p>Nabiki lay on her bed, reading one of her  favourite pastimes, paperback romance novels. Sure she was a heartless, cold  mercenary in her business and public life, a necessity to feed her family but  she wasn't at heart. Her mother raised her to be a kind and loving person, but  like Kasumi, who sacrificed her own dreams to take up the mother mantel when  their mother died, she sacrificed her heart and to take up the mercenary mantel  to save her family. Her family came first, even at the cost of her own  wellbeing.</p><p>Nabiki turned the page and smiled in  anticipation as she got to a good part. The love scenes made up for her lack of  a love life. Slowly she made her way down the page, nearing closer to the  naughty bits and finding herself getting more then a little hot.</p><p>Nabiki looked up, the mood ruined as she heard  two loud knocks on the door. Tossing her book down in disgust, she stormed to  her door. "If this isn't important people will pay!" thought Nabiki angrily as  she opened the door.</p><p>Before her stood a happy looking Ranma, a  surprising sight after the emotional distress the girl had gone through in the  recent past. Her anger subsided, replaced by a satisfied smile. It looked like  her plan to help Ranma had worked. "Ranma you look great, come on in and tell  me all about the party."</p><p>Ranma sat in her room, now private  because of her no good father bailing on her, but she'd make the best of her  new found privacy. Talking with Nabiki had been fun; her opinion on the  mercenary girl had drastically improved. She now considered her a friend,  although Nabiki did threaten that if Ranma told anyone that she helped her out,  she would make Ranma pay through the nose, not an idle threat. As for the  party, Ranma told Nabiki about most of it, only omitting the parts Maya  suggested.</p><p>Ranma had her breakfast shortly  after talking to Nabiki. Kasumi had once again out done herself and Ranma  appreciated every bite. Ranma had been hoping to run into Akane, but she had  left gone to school drama club audition earlier that morning, and that brought  Ranma to where she was now, alone in her room with time on her hands.</p><p>Without a second thought she had  retrieved the stuff Heero had given her from the purse and prepared the pipe  like she had seen Heero the night before. Using a lighter she had borrowed from  Mr. Tendo, he needed to quit smoking anyways; she lit the pipe and inhaled  deeply, waiting for the stuff to take effect.</p><p>She sighed as she felt the rush she  was beginning to love hit her. It felt as good as it did the night before.  Ranma wished she felt like this all the time.</p><p>It had been a week since the party  and Ranma had used up the rest of stuff Heero had given her. The last dose she  had taken didn't produce the good feelings as strongly and soon after they  ended the bad feeling began. Her body was racked with chills and aches that she  felt to the core. She wanted, no needed the stuff that Heero gave her or she  felt she would die. Desperately she searched the purse for Heero's number; he  must have more of the stuff. A shaky sigh of relief escaped her lips as she  found the number.</p><p>She rushed to the phone; thankful the  rest of the household had gone out for the evening and wouldn't see her like  this. Her hands shaking, she dialled the number as best as she could and held  her breath when it started ringing.</p><p>"Hello?" it was Heero and she was  ecstatic.</p><p>"Heero, I <i>need</i> more of that stuff," her voice full of desperation.</p><p>"Ah Ranma, I was wondering when  you'd call," his voice full of smugness and satisfaction. "Meet me at the Juban  train station parking lot, bring cash or will work something out, either way  you'll get your stuff," continued Heero.</p><p>"Ok, ok I'll bring the money, just  make sure you have that stuff for me!" cried a desperate Ranma. Slamming the  phone down, she raced to her room and ran straight to her closet. As quickly as  she could she pried open a loose floorboard and reached in and pulled out a wad  of cash, money she was saving to buy Akane's birthday present. All she cared  about was getting the stuff.</p><p>The train ride took forever; every  moment hurt her to the core. The cravings just got worse and worse. Every  moment was agony. Her heart jumped as the train pulled into Juban station.</p><p>She ran as fast as her legs could  carry her to the parking lot, desperately searching for Heero.</p><p>"Ranma, over here!" it was Heero, he  was calling to her, he had the stuff, and he was her saviour.</p><p>Her hands were shaking as she neared  him; she needed the stuff so badly.</p><p>He was smiling smugly as he ran a  hand through his hair. "You need it don't you, I can tell, I've seen the  desperation for another fix enough times and you need it bad."</p><p>"Yea, give it to me please," pleaded  Ranma.</p><p>"You know what you've been using  Ranma?" asked Heero, his smile seeming to get smugger. "Of course you don't  your too naïve, aren't you?" mocked Heero, moving closer to the shaking girl.  "You've been using heroin, a drug, and you're hooked," said Heero as he gently cupped  Ranma's face. "How much you want?"</p><p>"As, as much as I can," answered  Ranma, realizing she'd been set up, but too desperate for a fix to care. She  handed him her wad of bills.</p><p>Heero flipped through them, briefly  counting them. "You got about 83000 Yen here, your savings?" he said matter of  fact.</p><p>"Yea it was for a present, how much  can I get?" bagged Ranma her need overpowering her spirit.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist he tossed  her two baggies. "Enjoy, oh and Ranma, don't hesitate to call, I'll get you as  much as you need and if you can't pay we can work something out," casually said  Heero as he climbed into his car and left her with the goods.</p><p>Ranma didn't care what he said or  how he had duped her; all that mattered was her stuff… no heroin and the need  it satisfied. Quickly she made her way to a secluded area, a drainage canal at  the end of parking lot. As the shaking and chills became worse, she felt as if  her body was about to die.</p><p>Ranma inhaled deeply on her pipe,  silently urging the heroin to work quickly. Her wait for the drug to kick in  was agonizingly slow, but she sighed in relief as the rush finally hit her. Her  body began to feel good again. With her mission accomplished for now she decide  to head home, all the while basking in the warm grow she felt throughout her  body.</p><p>"Kasumi, I'm home!" called out Akane  as she tossed her school bag in the corner. "Did Ranma come home yet?"</p><p>"I'm afraid not Akane-chan, I  haven't seen her since she left for school this morning," called out Kasumi  from the kitchen. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>"No reason sis, I just wanted to  talk with her," lied Akane. The truth was she was very worried about Ranma.</p><p>The petite girl had been acting strange, very  strange over the last few weeks. Ranma had been to a party, Nabiki's idea and  although she was sceptical at first about her sister's reasons, the party  seemed to do the girl a load of good. When they had talked a few days later  Ranma seemed to have accepted her now permanent gender and the two of them  resolved many of the issues between them and now considered each other sisters.  Things seemed to be going great.</p><p>But then Ranma began to act erratic, leaving  for hours without telling anyone, she was skipping school almost on a daily  basis now and she had almost completely stopped practicing the art, her  greatest love. It didn't make any sense; Ranma just wasn't acting like Ranma  anymore.</p><p>Ranma wasn't the only thing Akane was worried  about though. Things had been going missing all over the house, money,  keepsakes and more troubling jewellery, her mother's jewellery. What was left  was hidden in her room. Her fear was that Mr. Saotome or perhaps Happosai were  secretly stealing their belongings to satisfy their greed. She may have been a  martial artist and no matter how it pained her to admit it, she wasn't near their  level and she needed Ranma to deal with her two suspects before the rest of her  mothers jewellery went missing, if she could get Ranma to stop acting funny and  back practicing the art. She'd have to talk with Ranma later when she got back.</p><p>Akane walked to her room, only stopping to grab  a snack from the kitchen. As she neared the door the sound of someone rummaging  around could be heard from within. Akane smiled and flung open the door.</p><p>"Ah ha, caught in the…" her voice trailed off  as the shock of what she saw before her sunk in. Ranma was rummaging through  her belongings, holding some of her mother's jewellery in her hands. Her heart  shattered, how could someone she cared about so much break her trust?</p><p>Ranma stood there staring at Akane; her face  had gone white when she realized she'd been caught red handed. She didn't want  to steal from her family, but her need was too great. The look of complete and  utter betrayal on Akane's face devastated her to the core.</p><p>"Akane I can explain, I…"</p><p>"Get out," Akane's voice was low and her eyes  full of cold hatred.</p><p>"Akane let me explain," pleaded Ranma.  "Please?"</p><p>"Get out and never come back," Akane's voice  increasing in intensity and anger.</p><p>"Please Akane please," begged Ranma, her eyes  pleading for forgiveness.</p><p>"OUT, OUT, OUT!" screamed Akane, collapsing to  the floor in tears as Ranma fled from her room. Akane sobbed harder when she  heard Ranma flee the house and Kasumi's calls for Ranma to come back.</p><p>Ranma did the only thing she could, she ran,  she ran as fast as she could, she had to get away and she couldn't face her  family again. She fled the house and didn't stop running until she could run no  more. She could never go back; her shame was too great to bear.</p><p>Too make things worse, the cravings she tried  to feed through the sale of the stolen goods were coming back tenfold. She  needed her heroin now and there was only one person she could turn too to get  it, Heero. He told her they could work something out and right now she was too  upset and craving it too badly to care what sort of deal they came up with.</p><p>She made it to a payphone and franticly made a  call to Heero, the now familiar aches and chills coursing through her body. She  waited and waited. Each ring an agonizing eternity.</p><p>"Yo?" it was Heero, her saviour.</p><p>"Heero it's me, Ra-Ranma," her voice stuttering  on her anxiety. "I need it badly."</p><p>"Ok, meet me at the usual place and bring the  cash," replied Heero, sounding almost board.</p><p>"That's a problem Heero."</p><p>"Oh, is it Ranma," his voice now full of  curiosity. "Are you saying you can't pay?" enquired Heero; he sounded like he  had won a prize. "Perhaps we can work something out; I'll pick you up at our  usual spot."</p><p>Ranma felt a great sense of relief. "Thank you,  thank you, thank you," she cried.</p><p>"Oh don't thank me, thank you, I'll meet you at  the station," replied Heero as he hung up the phone. Heero leaned back in his  chair and put his feet on his desk. "Hook line and sinker," he thought as he  reached for the phone, "Kenada's gonna love this."</p><p>Heero's anticipation grew as Kenada's phone  rang.</p><p>"Hello?" answered a groggy Kenada.</p><p>"Man get your ass over here, I'm getting Ranma  and you can break her in first."</p><p>"You shiting me?" asked a surprised, but now  alert Kenada.</p><p>"No way man, I'm picking her up in a few, she's  so hooked and desperate that she'll agree too anything for another fix of junk,"  explained Heero, his voice full of unsuppressed glee.</p><p>"I'm on my way," replied Kenada.</p><p>Heero hung up the phone and slicked back his  greased hair. Tonight was going to be a night to remember.</p><p>Ranma was miserable, the train ride  over took forever and she just felt worse and worse time went on. Now that she  was in Juban, Heero would give her what she needed and then nothing would  matter.</p><p>Heero was waiting in their usual  meeting place, looking more confident and smug then usual. Ranma nearly fell  over herself running too him.</p><p>"Into the car Ranma and you'll get  what you want," spoke a confident Heero.</p><p>Ranma silently obeyed without hesitation,  her need outweighing her common sense.</p><p>"Here's the deal Ranma, you work for  me and do as I say and you'll get all the heroin you want. I think that's  pretty fair, don't you Ranma?"  asked a  smiling Heero as he drove off.</p><p>What else could she do? It was the  only choice she had. "Ok I'll do what it takes," quietly answered Ranma. "I  need some now Heero, please give me some!" she pleaded.</p><p>"Sure, here you go," replied Heero,  pulling out a loaded syringe and tossing it to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma looked at Heero with confusion  and all Heero could do was laugh. "Don't worry girl it's heroin, just inject it  into a vain in your arm and you'll get the high you need."</p><p>Ranma uncapped the syringe and  flexed her arm to make the vain visible. Slowly she pushed the needle into her  arm and injected the contents. A few seconds later she felt the rush of  euphoria she needed. It was more intense and quicker then ever before and it  felt great, she was in heaven.</p><p>Heero watched as Ranma sighed in  pleasure and relaxed in her seat, her tension melting away. "Ranma your gonna  live and work at my place now, the other girls will help show you the ropes later,  but tonight your going to have your first customer, understand?"</p><p>Ranma just nodded at everything Heero  said, not caring what he said. All that mattered was the heroin.</p><p>Heero  looked at his newest girl with immense satisfaction. She was so hooked that  she'd do anything he said. He was gonna make a killing with this girl.</p><p>Kenada watched in anticipation from Heero's  office as Heero led the obviously stoned girl out of the car and into his place.  She didn't have a room yet so Heero would bring her here for her first night.  Kenada couldn't wait to fuck her; he'd been waiting for this day for weeks and  he was going to enjoy every minuet.</p><p>Kenada reclined in Heero's chair, thinking of  all the stuff he was gonna do to the girl all night long.</p><p>He turned his attention to the door as he heard  it opening. In walked Heero, his arms draped around Ranma, who seemed nervous  despite the heroin. She gasped when she saw who was waiting for her, the creep  from the party.</p><p>"She's all ready for you to take her for a test  drive, Kenada," joked Heero as he gave Ranma a little push in Kenada's  direction. "Enjoy yourself man and remember, this freebee is a one-shot deal,"  called out Heero as he left the room, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Kenada smiled gleefully as he walked up to the  girl and gave her a once-over while slowly moving his hands over her body,  enjoying every feeling he got. She was one hot woman, maybe one of the hottest  he'd ever seen.</p><p>Ranma fidgeted nervously as the creep's hands  moved across her body. Slowly she was led over to a coach by Kenada, fearing  what was going to come next.</p><p>"Don't be scared kid, you might even like it,"  reassured Kenada as he undid his pants.</p><p>Ranma's eyes went wide and her face turned  pale, Kenada was good and ready to start the fun, <i>very ready</i>. Kenada wrapped his arms around Ranma, pressed his body  roughly against hers and pushed her to the coach. "Let's have some fun," his  voice full of lust and desire.</p><p>All Ranma could do was nod and submit as Kenada  began pulling off her clothes. She needed her heroin too badly to risk  upsetting Heero by resisting now; she was already in too deep.</p><p>Ranma cried out as Kenada took the one and only  thing that was truly hers and the last thing she had to offer. It wasn't a cry  in pain or at the sight of her own blood on the  inside of her legs, no it was because she felt  the last of her honour slip away and the final realization that she could never  go back home, that she was no longer a martial artist, that she was nothing.</p><p>End part 1</p><p>Author's  Notes: This is my first work of fanfiction.
