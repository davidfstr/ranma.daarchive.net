</div>"Heh, that was easy." Standing proudly over the prone form<br/>of his opponent, Saotome Ranma let one of his trademark<br/>smirks form on his face. Said opponent's dark shawl and<br/>black cloak was slightly singed at the fringes, with tendrils of<br/>smoke wafting out of sleeve ends. The battle had been<br/>surprisingly short… actually, the guy just fell over half-way<br/>during the fight and crumpled onto the ground without a word.<br/>Now that Ranma thought about it, the strange guy didn't really<br/>talk all that much anyway; all he said was that he was called<br/>Shi, and the next second, he pulled out a wicked-looking<br/>scythe and started swinging. Of course, a minute after that,<br/>Shi was quite busy twitching and curling into a fetal position<br/>by the walkway in the park, which to the pigtailed martial<br/>artist counted as giving up the match. Needless to say, the fact<br/>that this Shi person had brushed aside his ki-blast like a fly<br/>and wove through the chestnut fist while bending over to<br/>polish his shoes with a black cloth was momentarily forgotten<br/>to Ranma as he continued to smirk.<p>Saotome, however, wasn't so completely engrossed in his self-<br/>congratulation that his recent opponent's spasms and moans<br/>didn't begin to bother him after a while. He crouched down<br/>and tapped Shi on the shoulder. "Hey, you okay?"<p>The man called Shi replied with a series of wheezing coughs<br/>and retching sounds, but managed to reach into the depth of<br/>his seemingly fathomless cloak and pull out a golden, rod-<br/>shaped object. Attached to one end was a post-it note, with<br/>the name "Saotome Ranma" written on it in a scratchy hand.<p>"For me?" Ranma pointed to himself with a finger and<br/>queried with a look of utter clueless-ness.<p>At this, the figure uttered a curse between clenched teeth, and<br/>spoke sarcastically through the shawl. "No, you idiot, it's for<br/>Tendo Akane!"<p>A minute later, Ranma walked away from the park, leaving<br/>behind the now curiously silent figure and the large bump<br/>sprouting on his forehead.<p>x x x<p>"Um, Akane, this is for you." Said Ranma back at the dojo<br/>while scratching the back of his head. After a moment, he<br/>added. "Some guy named Shi dropped it."<p>Flipping off the TV, which had just now been airing yet<br/>another rerun episode of Sailor Moon, Akane yawned and<br/>stretched and straightened up from the couch. "Oh." She oh-<br/>ed after sparing an uninterested glance at the shiny, knobby<br/>object in Ranma's hand. "That's nice... but why would<br/>someone give me a stir-fry carrot? Oh well, I guess we can<br/>have it for tonight."<p>Resisting the sudden shivers traveling down his spine, Ranma<br/>pointed out helpfully. "Uh, Akane, that's a tree branch, not a<br/>carrot."<p>Akane nodded absently, not having heard a word he said.<br/>"Yeah, I guess this will have to do. I was cooking a snack for<br/>you and left it on the dining table when Yuka called me on the<br/>phone. But," she frowned before continuing, "the food was<br/>gone when I came back downstairs. Kasumi said some guy in<br/>black showed up looking for you while I was talking with<br/>Yuka in my room, and she treated him to the snacks on the<br/>table, thinking they were the chocolate munch-balls she<br/>brought back from the candy store yesterday."<p>"Oh." This time, Ranma oh-ed. In the background, there<br/>suddenly was a strange noise, not unlike the torturous creaks<br/>of rusty gears that started to grind after years of neglect and<br/>poor maintenance.<p>"Don't worry though," the shorthaired girl said happily.<br/>"Now that I've got something to use, I can cook dinner."<p>"Er, wait. What were you making before anyway?" The<br/>question was asked partly in hope that it would distract Akane<br/>enough so she won't remember to make good on her word of<br/>making dinner, and partly out of a morbid sense of curiosity.<p>"Chunky beef stew, why?"<p>"…" Ranma began to edge away, noting that it was a very<br/>good time to make an exit and preferably leave the house<br/>altogether for an extended training trip.<p>Narrowing her eyes, Akane reached the same conclusion.<br/>"You're not thinking of running away again, are you?"<p>"No, why?" The rightfully accused grew a huge sweat-drop<br/>on the back of his head as he stammered.<p>"Because I'm getting tired of having you slip out on my<br/>cooking, Ranma." Akane sighed in exasperation, gently<br/>pushing him into a chair. "So, I've decided that I'll tie you<br/>into a chair and force-feed you from now on if I catch you<br/>trying to run."<p>x x x<p>"Open wide, Ranma!" In her oil-stained and sooty apron,<br/>Akane announced cheerfully as she wielded the sauteed tree-<br/>branch like a naginata and waved it in front of Ranma's wide,<br/>panicking eyes.<p>"But I haven't tried to run away yet, Aka-mmph!"<br/>Unfortunately, his protest was muffled by the piece of wood<br/>shoved into his mouth.<p>"Well," Akane explained a little too sweetly, "think of this as<br/>a preventative measure. I'm so glad Nabiki-neesan suggested<br/>it to me, don't you agree? Ranma?"<p>By now, of course, Ranma's face had turned a few shades<br/>beyond purple. His vision dimmed, and through his ears he<br/>heard the ebbing rush of the ocean that was his pulse. With<br/>his remaining strength he managed to utter the first, and likely<br/>last words that came to his mind.<p>"Uncute tomboy…"<p>Ukulele Studios<br/>Proudly Presents<p>Side Project Omega:<p>D I V I N E<br/>R A N M A D I E S<p>A Ranma ½ crossover fan-fiction.<p>"Mama, what's hell like?"<p>"Well," a gentle voice paused in reminiscence, then replied<br/>honestly. "He's a hunk."<p>"He?"<p>"Yup. He's your father, actually."<p>"…Dad?"<p>PROLOGUE: Desperately Seeking Ranma.<p>-1-<br/>The seed that blossomed into the fateful incident had been<br/>planted one month ago, almost exactly to the day. In<br/>retrospect, Mizuno Ami cursed herself for being stupid enough<br/>to get dragged into the whole mess. But… Rei was a good<br/>friend, so she guessed she had to help her out when the fire<br/>priestess was in a jam. It's just – well, who would've thought<br/>the girl was such a crazy fan for Ranma ½ manga?<p>About three weeks into the new semester, Rei's school<br/>implemented a mandatory computer literacy course for all<br/>students. Poor Rei, being traditional and a bit thick on the<br/>fingers, couldn't type to save her life and was therefore<br/>singled out as the most technologically challenged of the class.<br/>In fact, the little incident where she took half an hour to find<br/>the power button of her monitor on the first day of class<br/>spread like wildfire around the campus, much to Rei's irk and<br/>mortification. Of course, it wasn't her fault; who needed a<br/>screen or a remote control when you can watch TV through<br/>the sacred fire? Not that many of the senshi knew Rei spent<br/>half her fire viewing sessions homing in on soap opera signals<br/>after her grandfather discovered the religion channel and had<br/>been hogging the only television set in the shrine twenty four-<br/>seven.<p>So, to make a painfully long story short, the raven-haired<br/>priestess came to Ami one afternoon soon after and asked for<br/>an introduction into the world of computers. It was a slow and<br/>often frustrating start, but sheer stubbornness alone willed Rei<br/>to continue. And, within two weeks, the inevitable happened.<p>Rei discovered the internet. And, to Ami's horror, the chat<br/>rooms as well…<p>x x x<p>MIZU has joined the channel.<br/>RANMA88 wb, Mizu.<br/>MIZU *sigh* it's not like I'm here by choice, you know?<br/>RANMA88 ehehe, gomen.<br/>MIZU so, did you get all the commands down?<br/>MIZU for that matter, why do we have to meet in #Ranma?<br/>RANMA88 yeah, I think everything's good now, thx.<br/>RANMA88 I can probably get on without help from now on.<br/>RANMA88 Btw, Mizu, you just missed out something good.<br/>MIZU Oh? What is it?<br/>RANMA88 It's a conspiracy theory that ppl's come up here.<br/>MIZU Conspiracy?<br/>RANMA88 Yeah, the ppl here have been quoting the series<br/>like the Bible. They're saying Takahashi originally<br/>wrote Ranma during a fit of divine inspiration… in<br/>fact, they say that Takahashi coded the secrets to go<br/>to another world inside her manga, most likely in the<br/>names of the protagonists themselves.<br/>MIZU Haa?<br/>RANMA88 I know, freaky, don't you think?<br/>!RANMA 88 *winks* at MIZU.<br/>MIZU I think you need a break, that's what I think. You've<br/>been reading Foucault's Pendulum again at three-<br/>thirty in the morning, haven't you?<br/>RANMA88 How did you guess?<br/>MIZU Honestly! I lent the book to you because I thought<br/>you'd be interested in learning about other religions,<br/>not for this!<br/>RANMA88 No, really, listen to this. There's really a<br/>connection here. See, it's all about names. Ranma's<br/>dual sex gender prompts us to interpret his name in<br/>parts. "Ran", which means "chaos", and "ma",<br/>which means "horse" in Chinese. But, it can also<br/>mean "mother", or in a more general sense, "parent".<br/>And of course, Genma is Ranma's father, and the<br/>first character of his name means "mystery". So, it<br/>does make sense, considering the old notion that<br/>chaos rose from the unexplainable, the mystery.<br/>MIZU …I'm speechless.<br/>RANMA88 Wait, that's not all. It's been a consensus in the<br/>manga readers that Happosai is actually Genma's<br/>grandfather, and if we are to trace Ranma's lineage<br/>by name association, clearly you would think that the<br/>connection breaks there because his name didn't end<br/>with a "-ma", right? Wrong! When he's first<br/>introduced in volume 7, his forthcoming was foretold<br/>by bad omens associated with the signs of demonic<br/>presence. The fact that Happosai later proved that he<br/>could summon demons makes him more of a yoma<br/>than a human. So, we can conclude he was using a<br/>false human name after all.<br/>MIZU *sweatdrop* er, so… what was his real name, in your<br/>opinion?<br/>RANMA88 Why, the clues are all there! Since we see<br/>Happosai as a yoma, we can safely assume that he<br/>would yell out his own true name when he attacked<br/>his victims, all of which turned out to be women's<br/>underwear. And what did he say? "Hotcha"?<br/>"Sweeto"?<br/>MIZU If I remember correctly, I think he said "Akane" the<br/>first time. You mean Happosai's real name is<br/>actually Akane?<br/>RANMA88 …er, no. What I was getting to was that those<br/>translations could also be translated differently.<br/>Instead of "hotcha" or "sweeto", his words could<br/>have as well meant something like, "Yo, Mama!"<br/>Which fits perfectly, don't you see? Since he's a<br/>representation of demonic forces, his true name must<br/>therefore be "Yomama"!<br/>MIZU …I'm positive I'm not hearing this right.<br/>RANMA88 The only thing now is to figure out the one<br/>missing link – Genma's father, and Happosai's child.<br/>It's possible that this whole riddle hinges on his<br/>name, especially when he's not mentioned anywhere<br/>in the manga! It's almost as if he's been hidden<br/>deliberately, so that no one would figure out how to<br/>gain access to Takahashi-san's world.<br/>MIZU Um, Rei?<br/>RANMA88 Yeah?<br/>MIZU Quit IRC. Now.<br/>RANMA88 Okay, okay!<br/>RANMA88 has left the channel.<br/>MIZU Seriously…<br/>RANMA88 has joined the channel.<br/>RANMA88 Oh yeah, I forgot.<br/>MIZU What now?<br/>RANMA88 Call me RANMA88 when I'm in here.<br/>RANMA88 has left the channel.<br/>MIZU …<br/>!MIZU slaps RANMA88 around with a large trout.<br/>RANMA88 is nowhere to be found.<br/>MIZU AHHHHH!<br/>MIZU has left the channel.<p>-2-<br/>If one thing Ami could count on her fiery-tempered friend the<br/>most, it's tenacity. Two days after the chat room session, Ami<br/>received a call from Rei. "It's Taoma."<p>"Huh?"<p>"The missing link, Ami! Taoma is the name of Genma's<br/>dad!" Rei exclaimed excitedly.<p>Ami cringed. "Oh, not that again!"<p>"You see," Rei went on despite the uncustomary loud protests<br/>on the other side of the phone, "The Chinese mysteries<br/>originated from Taoism, which means "the way." And, Tao<br/>had its roots in the spiritual forces of nature, which in ancient<br/>times were more often than not malevolent, which means they<br/>were yoma – and there's the link to Happosai! See, it all<br/>connects together!"<p>Realizing any further protest was useless, Ami switched to a<br/>different tactic and decided to play along. "Okay, Rei. Let's<br/>suppose you're right, and there's really something into this<br/>whole other-world thing – which I still think is completely<br/>nonsense – how does figuring out the associations of names of<br/>Ranma's lineage help you?"<p>Rei paused for a moment. "That's what I'm still working on,"<br/>she admitted after a while. "What I believe is that Tao, or "the<br/>way", has been hidden by Takahashi symbolically. The only<br/>connection I've got is that since all the major characters<br/>inevitably show up in Nerima, Taoma must come to Nerima as<br/>well. Actually, he might have been hiding somewhere inside<br/>Nerima the whole time… wait! I've got it!"<p>"Don't tell me you think Nerima is actually a symbolic<br/>representation of Taoma now, or I'm hanging up." Ami<br/>deadpanned.<p>"No, no, I mean I think the mystery of Taoma may be literally<br/>hiding inside Nerima, as in the word itself. Maybe as a part of<br/>the letter combination."<p>"You're really stretching it, Rei."<p>Lost in her own thoughts, Rei asked suddenly. "Um, Ami,<br/>can you get the Mercury computer up?"<p>"What for?"<p>"Can you do an acronym search for Nerima? Something<br/>might come up."<p>"…no."<p>"Please?" Rei whined.<p>"Absolutely not. This is ridiculous. I'm going to bed, Rei."<br/>And Ami hung up.<p>x x x<p>"All right," Ami called back a few days afterwards. "I've got<br/>a name. Marie N., short for Marie Noman."<p>"I knew I could count on you, Ami." Rei smiled gratefully<br/>over the phone as she chewed the information over silently for<br/>a few minutes. "Noman… Noman… Wait a second, this is a<br/>girl?"<p>Ami raised an eyebrow on the other end. "I don't know many<br/>guys who'd call themselves "Marie", Rei."<p>"That's weird… how can he be a girl?"<p>"I dunno." Having become quite fed up over her friend's<br/>strange obsessions over the last few weeks, Ami added with<br/>more than a trace of sarcasm, "Blame her parents? Why don't<br/>you just give up, Rei? There's no way this Marie person is<br/>your Taoma."<p>The sarcasm was completely lost to Rei, who was deep in her<br/>own thoughts. "No, there's gotta be something I'm<br/>missing…" Suddenly, her tone grew excited. "Wait, I got it…<br/>Why, that's perfect! You know what this means, right?"<p>"No," Ami intoned dreadfully.<p>"This means that the theory of the mirror world has been<br/>confirmed! Remember how the Ranma gang used the Nanban<br/>mirror to travel to different times and places? It follows that<br/>Taoma, who must have somehow left the Ranma world and<br/>traveled to ours, becomes a mirror copy of himself… and how<br/>else to do that other than to be transformed into the opposite,<br/>mirroring sex? And, what a more perfect name to give<br/>himself than "Noman", after he found out the price of coming<br/>here? Ami, you're a genius."<p>"God knows why I'm doing this for you," The blue-haired girl<br/>exhaled deeply. "And, for your information, perhaps he just<br/>had a sex operation after he came here, for whatever reasons.<br/>Provided that indeed this Taoma person existed, and he indeed<br/>came to our world through some unknown magical means and<br/>lived under a pseudonym."<p>Rei was momentarily stunned. "Um," she drawled out, "I<br/>guess… that's a possibility too." She managed in a distasteful<br/>tone. "It's a good way to hide your identity, at least."<p>"So," Ami asked, "now that we got this name, are you<br/>satisfied?"<p>"…Let's contact her."<p>"WHAT?"<p>"Does she have an email?"<p>Ami was close to seething now. This was getting way too<br/>much. "Yes, but I won't do it!"<p>"Pretty please?" Rei whined again.<p>"Absolutely not!"<p>-3-<br/>Five days, three hours and forty-seven minutes later, Rei<br/>received another call from the resourceful senshi of Mercury.<br/>This time, she noted, Ami actually sounded happy – a fact that<br/>was quite strange to the fire priestess. In fact, she could tell<br/>Ami was trying hard not to giggle out loud. "I got a email<br/>response from Marie earlier today. But," she paused,<br/>suppressing a laugh, "I'm not sure you want the message."<p>"Of course I want it! I'll be the first one to prove that<br/>Ranma's world actually exists!" Rei exclaimed. Then,<br/>calming herself down from her sudden euphoria, she asked.<br/>"What did you write to her? And, more importantly, what did<br/>she say?"<p>"Well," Clearing her throat, Ami replied, "I told her about this<br/>nonsense conspiracy of yours, and that you believe she's the<br/>one link that can provide you with clues to gain access into the<br/>Ranma world, that you're desperately seeking an answer, or at<br/>least some hint."<p>"And…?"<p>"She returned with five words of advice." With as much<br/>solemnity as she could muster in such a short time, Ami<br/>announced, "Marie said, and I quote, 'You must be officially<br/>nuts.'" Then, unable to hold out any longer, Ami started<br/>laughing.<p>"H-How dare…" Rei sputtered indignantly, but was quickly<br/>cut off by Ami.<p>"Rei!" She continued to giggle as she went on, "It's your fault<br/>anyway. I mean, if I didn't know better, I'd say as much<br/>under the circumstances." Finally, after getting her breathing<br/>back under control, Ami queried. "So you're finally giving up<br/>on this ludicrous theory?"<p>"No," Rei replied immediately. "If this Marie won't<br/>cooperate, I'll just find another way to crack this puzzle."<p>Ami was incredulous. "For god's sake, Rei! Can't you get it<br/>through your head that there was no puzzle to begin with?<br/>There's no mystical Ranma world hiding inside Takahashi<br/>Rumiko's manga, and there's no such person as "Taoma" who<br/>escaped from the alternate world to ours!" Without as much of<br/>a pause, Ami added, "Listen to the girl! She called you<br/>officially nuts – do you know what the official word for "nuts"<br/>is, Rei? It's lunatic! You're going to go mad if this goes on<br/>any longer."<p>The raven-haired senshi, who had endured the entirety of her<br/>friend's tirade, finally asked in a quiet voice after a bit of<br/>silence. "What did you say?"<p>"Um, that is, I mean…" Suddenly aware that her words might<br/>have hurt Rei, Ami was at a loss of words. "I mean, I didn't<br/>mean what I meant…"<p>"No, Ami, I'm serious." Rei interrupted. "What did you<br/>say?"<p>In a meek voice, Ami drawled out. "Um… I called you a<br/>lunatic." Then, she added, "I'm sorry, Rei."<p>"Hold on, lemme think." Rei cut her friend off once more.<br/>"Lunatic… lunatic… luna… lu – that must be it! Ami, you<br/>cracked the message! It's the moon!"<p>"I went a bit far, really, I didn't mean… huh?" The blue-<br/>haired girl paused in her hasty apology in total confusion.<p>"It's the moon!" Rei repeated. "How clever… The original<br/>way is hidden, but there's a different route! Marie gave us a<br/>hint on how to look for the alternate way: Look for the moon!"<p>"Oh. My. God." Ami gritted her teeth in frustration. "I don't<br/>believe this." Then, after a short pause, she sighed in a tired<br/>voice. "Does this mean you want to go to the moon now?"<p>Rei didn't answer for a while. At last, with a strange glint in<br/>her eyes, the priestess said, "No. Not to the moon. This<br/>Marie, whoever she is, knows about us. She wants us to go to<br/>Usagi."<p>-4-<br/>"Wait, wait!" Ami called to the fire senshi as she was dragged<br/>through the local neighborhoods in Juuban by the wrist later<br/>that afternoon. "Hold on, Rei!"<p>Her plea was ignored. "C'mon, let's go! I've got a feeling<br/>that we're on the right track."<p>Still being forced at a half-run pace, Ami countered, "But Rei,<br/>think about it! You're over-interpreting the message again.<br/>How in the world can she know that the senshi contacted her?<br/>And what reason does she have to want us to go to Usagi for<br/>clues?"<p>Much to her relief, Rei slowed down. "I don't know, Ami.<br/>But, I'm going to find out. Things may have become more<br/>serious than I thought, if our identities are compromised. That<br/>just means there's even more reason to hurry!"<p>"…Wait!"<p>The two started running again.<p>x x x<p>Usagi turned out to be couching on the sofa in the living room,<br/>apparently engrossed in some sort of magazine when they<br/>found her. "Hey guys. What's up?" She said cheerfully<br/>without raising her head.<p>"Usagi," Rei asked. "Has anything strange happened lately?<br/>Like, has any stranger approached you?"<p>"Not really," Usagi, now totally baffled, did raise her head to<br/>look at them this time. "And how come both of you looked so<br/>flushed?"<p>Ami, still too out of breath to reply, just shot Rei a mildly<br/>annoyed glance.<p>Rei managed to look apologetic. "Um, well," she started, but<br/>seemed to fumble for words to continue. "We're just being<br/>careful, that's all. I thought someone might have figured out<br/>our senshi identities."<p>The moon princess was surprised for a moment, but quickly<br/>recovered. "Naah," she said, her attention span in the<br/>conversation lost once more, "you're probably just<br/>overreacting."<p>From her side, Rei could feel Ami giving her an "I-told-you-<br/>so" look. For once she kept her temper in check and did not<br/>choose to take offense on the "overreacting" bit, Rei asked<br/>again. "So you've never heard of someone called "Marie<br/>Noman", Usagi?"<p>With her head buried in the magazine, Usagi mumbled<br/>something in reply.<p>"Usagi…Usagi? Are you listening to me?" By now,<br/>however, the raven-haired girl could feel her patience<br/>beginning to wear thin. Noticing that her princess was still too<br/>absorbed in the magazine to answer, Rei's curiosity got the<br/>better of her. "Just what are you reading, anyway?" She<br/>asked casually.<p>This got a reply. "Oh, it's an updated restaurant guide in<br/>Tokyo that I found in the mailbox today. I don't know where<br/>it came from though… whoever sent it to me forgot to put<br/>down his address."<p>Go figure, Ami thought and smiled for the first time since she<br/>arrived at the Tsukino residence. Always count on Usagi to<br/>be… well, Usagi. The only book that could get her interested<br/>is either comics or restaurant guides.<p>Expecting Rei to blow up any minute now over how, as usual,<br/>their leader chose to pay more attention to food than to her<br/>friends, she did not count on Rei saying something in an<br/>excited tone. "Wait," the fire senshi said to Usagi. "Turn<br/>back to the last page."<p>"Huh? Um, okay." Usagi did as she was asked. "Um," she<br/>asked after a while, noticing how quiet her friend had<br/>suddenly become, "Rei? Are you okay?"<p>Finding her interest piqued, Ami walked over to the duo and<br/>leaned over the sofa to see what had gotten Rei so interested<br/>all of a sudden. Perhaps, after all, Rei finally gave up on her<br/>silly theories, Ami thought to herself.<p>What greeted her eyes instead was the photo of a newly<br/>opened French restaurant taken at night. "La Voie Nouvelle"<br/>– the new way, the advertisement printed. Not far off in the<br/>background, Ami could see the silhouette figure of the Tokyo<br/>Tower drawn out in little dots of light at evening, and to the<br/>right shone a beautiful full moon, the radiance cascading down<br/>the Tower in all her mysterious splendor.<p>-5-<br/>"Remind me again why we're here up on top of the Tokyo<br/>Tower at ten o'clock in the evening on a school night?" Sailor<br/>Mercury asked Sailor Mars. "And why are we here in Sailor<br/>forms?"<p>Mars replied. "Well, you did agree that this may be a possible<br/>new threat worth investigating into, no matter how small a<br/>chance it may be. And you saw the advertisement yourself.<br/>It's as good as confirmed that our theory was correct so far. I<br/>mean, remember that the Saotomes and the Tendos were<br/>supposed to be joined in family, right? "Tendo" just happened<br/>to mean the way of heaven, and what with Marie telling us to<br/>look for the moon, what more logical conclusion can you draw<br/>than the fact that we should go to the top of the Tokyo Tower,<br/>a building that is symbolically as close to heaven – and<br/>therefore the moon – as possible?"<p>"We could always climb Fuji-san, Mars."<p>"…" The senshi of fire said.<p>"For that matter, now that we're here, what do we do? If we<br/>can really go to another world through the top of the Tokyo<br/>Tower, don't you think there may be some special magical<br/>incantation that we have to know?"<p>"Er, no." Mars admitted. "I thought it's going to be like that<br/>news report a while back, where three girls on a school trip to<br/>the top of the Tower just disappeared suddenly in broad<br/>daylight."<p>The blue-haired put a hand to her forehead and groaned.<br/>"You're talking about Magic Knight Rayearth, and that's a<br/>manga series, not news!"<p>"Oh." Mars oh-ed lamely. "Maybe," she suggested in a<br/>momentary spark of inspiration, "we can find the hint through<br/>the word "Saotome"… after all, it's the only one base left we<br/>haven't covered."<p>Mercury thought about that for all of three seconds. "Don't.<br/>Even. Go. There." She said in a low, dangerous voice. "If<br/>you're going to suggest something crazy, like how we should<br/>go to the side of the Tower that's closest to the moon and bend<br/>over the railing to emulate the gesture of girls plucking rice in<br/>a field, which is what "Saotome" literally means, and which<br/>you can probably find some hare-brained connection to how<br/>this gesture ties to the moon because we're in effect going to<br/>stick our butts out in the air and "moon" everyone else, I<br/>swear I'm going to leave right this minute."<p>x x x<p>"I can't believe I got talked into doing this," Sailor Mercury<br/>gritted her teeth and said to Sailor Mars, bending over the rails<br/>on the eastern edge of the top of the Tokyo Tower in a gesture<br/>not unlike a girl plucking rice in a field. "Do you have any<br/>idea how embarrassing this is?"<p>Mars, in a similar position, shot back. "Well, you did suggest<br/>it."<p>"I only meant it as a joke, not to actually do it!" The senshi of<br/>water protested. "Seriously though," she continued after a<br/>pause, momentarily giving in to her friend's adamant beliefs,<br/>"have you given any consideration as to what would happen if<br/>we really found ourselves in the Ranma world? I mean, how<br/>are we going to get back home?"<p>"Um, I haven't thought about it."<p>"For that matter, with your theory of the mirroring effect on<br/>the worlds, we could both end up as men over there, you<br/>know." Mercury added as an afterthought.<p>"…" Realizing this herself for the first time, Mars turned to<br/>stare at her companion with bulging eyes. "Um, now that I<br/>really stop to think about this whole thing, maybe this isn't a<br/>good idea after all."<p>"Should've thought of it sooner." Ami said. Or she thought<br/>she did. She only realized that she didn't say it in fact right<br/>about the same time Mars did, which was when someone took<br/>the ridiculously inviting opportunity they presented and<br/>booted the two over the edge of the railings.<p>x x x<p>As she remembered during the forced, if short, flight down the<br/>Tokyo Tower, the seed that blossomed into the fateful incident<br/>had been planted one month ago, almost exactly to the day.<br/>Again, in retrospect, Mizuno Ami cursed herself for being<br/>stupid enough to get dragged into the whole mess. Everything<br/>did make sense now, she realized. There really was some<br/>clever plan involved, it's just that she couldn't see it until now.<br/>Some new enemy must have found out about their identities,<br/>and tricked Rei into thinking that there was some cosmic plan<br/>hidden and coded in her favorite manga. Rei, being her<br/>stubborn self, was led around the nose her whole time. Right<br/>about now, this unknown enemy would turn their targets to the<br/>other senshi, and the two of them would never live to warn<br/>their fellows about the danger.<p>Before darkness took over her, Ami's last thought was how<br/>humiliating it had been, to literally have their butts kicked<br/>over the edge of the Tokyo Tower by an enemy they didn't<br/>even see and falling to their deaths.<p>[END PROLOGUE]
