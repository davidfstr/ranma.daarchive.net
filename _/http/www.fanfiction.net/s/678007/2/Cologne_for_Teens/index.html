</div>A Ranma 1 / 2 Alternate Histories Company Presents:<p>Cologne for Teens<p>By: Felix Webster ( Felix Warstar )<p>Disclaimer: All original Ranma ½ Characters and Back story is the<br/>1993 copyright of Rumiko Takahashi/Shogakukan, Inc. and is a<br/>trademark of Viz Communications, Inc. This is written for fun and not<br/>for any profit so please don't sue as I'm a poor writer who one day<br/>hopes to write something original and become a so called professional<br/>writer. . . this just practice.<p>Note: Not for the KotF out there as it is a R+C fic.<p>Chapter 2<p>[Draft copy]<p>- Choices, Decisions and Cologne -<p>Soun was once again crying and overreacting all around the<br/>livingroom as he did when any family crisis occurred, "Oh my little<br/>girl is a little girl again!"<p>"Please calm down Father, it's not so bad after all. I think it's<br/>nice having her so young again," Kasumi smiled from behind her cup of<br/>tea.<p>"Nice! NICE! How would you like to be suddenly too young to even<br/>be in High-school!" Akane screamed bolting up right from her place<br/>at the table. Kasumi had found her one of her old overalls that they<br/>hadn't given away but it showed a lot of wear in area like the knees.<p>"Calm down Akane," Nabiki put a hand on the young girl's shoulder<br/>and pushed Akane back down until she sat down again. "Look on the<br/>bright side, at least Daddy can't push you into marrying Ranma for a<br/>few years."<p>"A FEW YEARS!" Akane bolted up again and looked in a panic. "I<br/>thought you said you could get more mushrooms next year?"<p>"Yes I did, but who knows what might go wrong then. You also just<br/>might want to grow up again by that time too," Nabiki replied calmly<br/>not bothering tho try to get Akane to sit this time. "Just think, no<br/>Kuno, no Kadachi. . . and no Hentai Horde."<p>"No Kuno or Kodachi?" Akane looked very confused.<p>"Kuno either won't recognize you or if he does can't actually try<br/>anything with you anymore or he'll goto jail," Nabiki gave the girl<br/>an evil grin. "People may ignore a cad trying to push himself on a<br/>girl around his own age but they wouldn't ignore him trying that with<br/>a kid."<p>"Kodachi I don't believe will be interested in such a younger Ranma<br/>as it would not look good to her peers," Kasumi added still sipping<br/>tea.<p>"What about the engagement!" Soun cried out grabbing two fistfuls<br/>of hair. "How are they to marry now!"<p>"It's only a two year difference in age Daddy," Nabiki rolled her<br/>eyes at her Father's antics. "They can still be engaged they just<br/>can't marry for a while."<p>"Yes, it gives them the time they have needed to know each other<br/>without the added pressure you keep pushing on them," Kasumi stated<br/>calmly still holding the quiet charm she always tried for.<p>- - - -<p>"I can't believe the old Master would do this!" Genma bellowed with<br/>the sound echoing off the recently rebuilt Dojo walls as he looked at<br/>his now teenage wife and younger son.<p>"It's not hard to believe dear. That old. . man is a freak who<br/>enjoys causing trouble in other's lives," Nodoka replied in a nasty<br/>tone with her arms crossed.<p>"You know I can't do anything about him! He's the old Master!" Genma<br/>said defensively looking at the missing ceiling instead of his wife.<br/>"Anyhow what were those mushrooms doing back in the first place?"<p>"I told ya, me and Nabiki came up with a plan ta get Shampoo off my<br/>back," Ranma replied just as defensively. "How was I ta know Nabiki<br/>picked up more then we needed?"<p>"You were planning on making Shampoo a child again? If you wanted to<br/>leave your girlfriend there are better ways," Nodoka gave her son an<br/>annoyed look.<p>"It wasn't for Shampoo! It was for the old Ghoul!" Ranma protested<br/>quickly.<p>"And this is Nabiki we are talking about, of course she's going to<br/>pick more then needed 'cause they could make her rich," Genma added<br/>his view of Ranma's mistake then grabbed his head as he realized<br/>another problem. "What are we going to do about the engagement! With<br/>Ranma thirteen and Akane even younger how are they going to marry!"<p>"That can be solved in a year according to Nabiki dear, but my<br/>problem can't be!" Nodoka stated calmly but her agitation of the<br/>situation was starting to show. "She said the biggest the mushrooms<br/>got before dying was twenty centimetres, so the most they could make<br/>would be twenty years old."<p>"But Mom. . . ya get the have all the years ya spent without us back<br/>again," Ranma said surprising himself that there was a benefit to<br/>this.<p>"That. . that would be nice dear, but even at age twenty how do I<br/>explain the fact I have a teenage son?" Nodoka asked her son then<br/>turned on her husband jumping up and shouting in his face. "And I<br/>might not want to spend them with this BEAR OF A MAN!"<p>"Most woman would kill for this chance to have their youth back. .<br/>." Genma stated as he started moving away quickly then realized a<br/>mistake in his choice of words.<p>"You're right dear, a death should be required for such a boon as<br/>this," Nodoka agreed in a low growling voice as she started to pull<br/>the katana out.<p>"Yeah, but Happosai isn't here for that right now," Ranma said<br/>trying to get the focus off of his Father as it wasn't Genma's fault<br/>this time. "And it wouldn't have happened if I coulda found ya ta<br/>warn ya about the one he left in our room for ya first."<p>"Ranma. . what makes you think it was meant for me?" Nodoka asked<br/>cocking an eyebrow at her son after glaring at her husband and<br/>sheathing the blade. "Happosai knows me better than to expect me to<br/>eat a mysterious bowl of rice left in a place like a bedroom. If<br/>anything it was meant for you or your Father, and Happosai would<br/>never waste something like that on your Father."<p>"So. It. Was. Meant. For. Me!" Ranma said as his anger grew. It<br/>had been alright if this had been an accident and he had saved his<br/>Mother from one attempt by the old Freak, but that it was the<br/>intention of his to make Ranma like this made Ranma feel very stupid<br/>that he fell for it so easily. Ranma didn't like feeling stupid, it<br/>made him mad. . . Akane's level of mad.<p>"Yes dear I believe so. Now how are we going to explain this to the<br/>school? Ranma and Akane have to start in just over a week," Nodoka<br/>asked ignoring the dark red energy starting to flow off of her son.<p>- - - -<p>"Great-Grandmother! Great-Grandmother!" Shampoo called out as she<br/>ran into the front of the Nekohanten.<p>"In the kitchen child," responded a young woman's voice from the<br/>said place.<p>Shampoo ran into the kitchen but stopped in shock seeing only Mousse<br/>and a very familiar looking Amazon girl wearing one of Shampoo's<br/>Chinese pantsuits that was too small for the girl, "Where Great-<br/>Grandmother!"<p>"I'm right here child," the younger girl stated calmly. "I hope you<br/>don't might me borrowing your white pantsuit as it's one you rarely<br/>wear."<p>"Who you?" Shampoo asked confused not fully understanding why the<br/>lavender haired girl answered for her Great-Grandmother.<p>"Shampoo, child, I am Ku Lon your Great-Grandmother and Elder,"<br/>Cologne replied starting to get annoyed as she approached the older<br/>looking girl. "I have had my physical age reduced by magic today."<p>"HI YA! Not Great-Grandmother too!" Shampoo exclaimed loudly with<br/>fear in her eyes.<p>"What do you me 'not me too'? Explain yourself child," Cologne moved<br/>to the girl and gave her a serious look.<p>"Shampoo was going to see Airen but. .but he and angry girl are very<br/>young now!. . . like you," Shampoo replied quickly.<p>"Stay here child, I have to see to this!" Cologne ordered as she<br/>left the restaurant quickly.<p>"Great-Grandmother no fit in Shampoo's clothes," Shampoo said in<br/>disbelief as she watched the girl leave blinking several times.<p>"She isn't as well built as you are my love," Mousse replied to the<br/>cooking pot to the left of Shampoo.<p>"Shut up Mousse!" Shampoo put his head into the same pot before<br/>walking out the kitchen nose in the air.<p>"What?" Mousse asked in confusion as he pulled his face out of the<br/>pot. "She's only thirteen and your near seventeen, of course your<br/>better built!"<p>"MOUSSE!" Shampoo screamed for the other room in anger. "SHUT<br/>UP!"<p>- - - -<p>Everyone was sitting around the low dinner table again trying to<br/>make the decisions that had to be made now that several people in the<br/>house were now effected in a serious manner. Kasumi has put out fresh<br/>tea for everyone and was waiting for some more hot water as Ranma-<br/>chan had a fight with her Father which ended with her in the pond yet<br/>again.<p>"So it's decided then, Ranma and Akane stay engaged. The wedding<br/>will happen either when this is solved or they are old enough again<br/>to make it legal," Nodoka explained what the main discussion was<br/>about. She gave a Nabiki nasty look when she mentioned age.<p>"What about school?" Akane asked fretting as she had the most to<br/>lose in this way. "How am I going to go this year looking like a kid?"<p>"We'll deal with the school tomorrow as it was too late to contact<br/>anyone tonight," Nabiki replied looking unhappy. "But I can guess<br/>what palm tree head will do."<p>"So can I," Ranma-chan agreed looking very depressed as she sat<br/>there in a shirt large enough to wear as a short dress. Even at<br/>thirteen she was big breasted but that wasn't saying there was a lot<br/>there, just more then the average thirteen year old. She looked over<br/>at her Mother and new her problem with her chest came from that side<br/>of the family. Her Mother said she had to grow into her breasts and<br/>it looked like she had to again.<p>"Sorry to interrupt," a young woman's voice said from the yard as a<br/>young teenager about Ranma-chan's height came to the sliding doors on<br/>the porch wearing a white Chinese pantsuit with blue edging and<br/>designs. "Shampoo told me that there was a problem."<p>"Hey Cologne," Ranma-chan said with a sad smile. "Ya ain't the only<br/>one who ate a mushroom today."<p>"I can see that," Cologne replied taking the red-head's greeting as<br/>an invitation to come in. "Mrs. Saotome I see you got the better of<br/>the choices."<p>"Please call me Nodoka, the least I'm reminded that I'm married<br/>right now the better," Nodoka smiled at Cologne after glaring at<br/>Genma.<p>"I see the mushroom has done you well," Nabiki smirk slightly at the<br/>sight of her handiwork, the only one she had a hand in. "You look<br/>almost like when you did when we went through that mirror. . . just<br/>smaller and not as busty."<p>"I had a growth spurt when I was seventeen," Cologne replied giving<br/>Nabiki a nasty look. "I was a little touchy about my height until<br/>then."<p>"Won't mention it again," Nabiki sipped her tea not wanting Cologne<br/>as an enemy at the moment.<p>"I think this would be best left to the women, Tendo," Genma got up<br/>nervously as he didn't want to be around Cologne when talk about the<br/>old Master started.<p>"I believe it would," Soun agreed as he stood up himself and both<br/>left the room quickly.<p>"So, what happened?" Cologne asked the group after finishing her<br/>withering gaze at the two cowards retreating forms.<p>"Happosai," Akane replied through gritted teeth.<p>"That explains everything," Cologne gave the child a sad smile.<p>- - - -<p>So, I will accompany you to the school tomorrow to deal with this. I<br/>have to enroll as it is and Furinkin is doing all the local schools<br/>enrollments this term," Cologne said as she sat next to Ranma-chan on<br/>the other side from Akane sipping the tea Kasumi gave her. "It is<br/>either enrollment or dealing with the new truancy officers that<br/>Principal Kuno has hired every time I wish to go out during the day."<p>"You'll be a great help if Pineapple brain tries anything crazy,"<br/>Ranma-chan agreed, she was a little annoyed that the hot water for<br/>her change was use to refill the tea instead of on her but she wasn't<br/>going to complain tonight. . . it would too dangerous with all the<br/>angry women in the room to demand to be male again.<p>"Then I think we should go shopping right after as the clothes we<br/>have will not do," Cologne pulled at the loose white top of the<br/>pantsuit she borrowed.<p>"We're a little strapped for cash right now, we have to rebuild the<br/>Dojo yet again," Nabiki pointed to the direction of where the<br/>roofless outer building was giving Akane an annoyed look.<p>"I said I was sorry!" Akane shot to her feet.<p>"Sorry isn't money, sorry isn't a new Dojo," Nabiki replied in a<br/>snarl.<p>Akane tried to say something, she then tried to shout something but<br/>all that came out were a couple of tears. She bolted out of the room<br/>crying a full stream. When Ranma-chan tried to follow Kasumi grabbed<br/>her arm to drop her, "Let her cry herself out. She's needed this for<br/>a long time to help drain the frustration away."<p>"Lucky her," Ranma-chan said under her breath as she sat down again.<br/>Ranma-chan knew Kasumi was talking about more frustration then just<br/>the situation with the mushrooms.<p>"Money for the new wardrobes isn't a problem, I'll help to that<br/>end," Cologne offered getting back to the matters at hand.<p>"You shouldn't trouble yourself," Nodoka replied with polite smile.<p>"The trouble is mine though," Cologne smiled back, but the smile<br/>held a lot of tension in it. "The mushrooms were brought here for my<br/>benefit. . . and I should have killed Happosai years ago so he's<br/>somewhat my fault too."<p>"Hey I won't pass up a new wardrobe," Nabiki grinned. "I have to<br/>think about college next year after all."<p>"I'll cover for only those affected by the mushrooms," Cologne<br/>clarified giving Nabiki a nasty grin, "and for Kasumi Tendo since she<br/>could use a new wardrobe more then most."<p>"Hey!" Nabiki exclaimed in a pout to which she received a stuck out<br/>tongue from Cologne. "Maybe I won't be as much help tomorrow then."<p>"As you wish," Cologne grinned. "You've been more then enough help<br/>already. . . hasn't she, Airen?"<p>"Yeah she has. . . NOW WAIT A MINUTE!" Ranma-chan nearly jumped<br/>twenty feet when she realized what was said. "I AIN'T YOUR AIREN!"<p>"I'm just kidding," Cologne chuckled, then added quietly to herself.<br/>"For the time being."<p>"Don't do that!" Ranma-chan sat down eyeing Cologne carefully as<br/>others at the table started chuckling too taking it as the joke<br/>Cologne claimed it to be.<p>"Why does it bother you so much?" Cologne asked suddenly looking<br/>very confused.<p>"It means I have no choice in things! I want to make my own choices<br/>for a change! But I've never been given the chance!" Ranma-chan<br/>glared at her Father's empty position at the table. "Trainin' that<br/>causes me ta go nuts! Leavin' friends behind when I didn't havta<br/>'cause no one explained what the choices meant! And then there are<br/>the Fiances I'm not told about until the last possible moment!"<p>"Heck even when given a choice between girls here it's taken away<br/>from me by the girls themselves!" Ranma-chan turned his glare towards<br/>Nabiki as she couldn't bring herself to glare at Kasumi, but only<br/>just barely not able.<p>" then! I d.'t want it like that either!" Akane's voice<br/>came from behind the group cracking and sniffling from the hard<br/>crying she had been doing. As Ranma-chan turned all she saw was the<br/>retreating form of Akane who ran back up stairs crying again.<p>"Great, the famous Saotome mouth strikes again," Ranma-chan muttered<br/>under her breath with her head down.<p>"You were bound to say it sooner or later child, at least this way<br/>she can cry it all out in one day," Cologne patted Ranma-chan on the<br/>back. "Although her reaction is rather alien to her. . ."<p>"Mother always told us that big girls didn't cry. . . I think the<br/>change has caused a problem with that idea," Kasumi explained calmly<br/>as she poured Cologne more tea.<p>"And since she isn't a big girl anymore she doesn't have to stop the<br/>tears," Cologne finished nodding.<p>"And it is about time too as she has been focussing her sadness into<br/>her temper for too long," Kasumi looked grim about the past.<p>"What? So no more malleting?" Ranma-chan asked looking between the<br/>group at the table and the exit towards upstairs.<p>"You almost sound disappointed," Nabiki smirked.<p>"No, I'd say my son is trying to decide which hurts more, Akane<br/>malleting him or seeing her in tears," Nodoka replied but Ranma-chan<br/>ignored both of them.<p>"Well I'll let you deal with this as I should get back and explain<br/>things to my Great-Granddaughter before she does something rash,"<br/>Cologne stood then kissed the top of Ranma-chan's head before running<br/>out the door to the yard as everyone but Nodoka dropped from shock.<br/>"They're too much fun."<p>"Oh how manly, Ranma has picked up another girlfriend," Nokoda<br/>stated trying to hide her giggling behind her tea cup.<p>- - - -<p>Cologne ran into the Nekohanten in a panic as there was thick black<br/>smoke coming from every window. The first thing she found was a tied<br/>up duck in the main restaurant room trying desperately to get loose.<br/>She snapped the chain holding Mousse and carried him into the kitchen<br/>area where the smoke was thickest, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING CHILD!"<p>"Shampoo find cure for Airen! No want child for husband!" Shampoo<br/>said between coughs. She was standing next to a large ancient tome<br/>opened on the table and a big cooking pot with the thick smoke coming<br/>out in rope like black tendrils.<p>"That book will not find you a cure, unless you are trying to make<br/>Ranma die of old age!" Cologne stated firmly as she put a lid on the<br/>pot and closed the tome. "And thirteen is not a kid!"<p>"But. . but. . ." Shampoo tried to argue but a glare from Cologne<br/>stopped her.<p>"Something else you should know, All the 'Kisses' you've given have<br/>been annulled completely," Cologne said in a low angry tone. "I'd<br/>send you home right now but you still need a husband so you don't<br/>shame the tribe or this family any worse than you have."<p>"But. . but what about Shampoo and Ranma!" Shampoo asked in panic<br/>mode.<p>"If you still want Ranma you'll have to try to get him the same way<br/>the rest of us has to now," Cologne replied still annoyed as she<br/>started to clean up the mess. "Of course he is too young for you now."<p>"You mean get Ranma's Father to engage Shampoo to Ranma?" Shampoo<br/>blinked several times. "Already tried that but Ranma's Mother stop<br/>idea."<p>Cologne face faulted then started to swear heavily as she finished<br/>the clean up. "Get Mousse changed back, we have to deal with the<br/>dinner crowd soon."<p>- - - -<p>Author's Notes: This is just the draft copy as someone is proofing<br/>it as I write this, I'm puting it out for those to enjoy while the<br/>edited version is being worked on.
