</div>A Ranma 1 / 2 Alternate Histories Company Presents:<p>Cologne for Teens<p>By Felix Webster ( Felix Warstar )<br/>[felix_]<p>Disclaimer: All original Ranma ½ Characters and Back story Copyright<br/>Rumiko Takahashi. This is written for fun and not for any profit so<br/>please don't sue as I'm a poor writer who one day hopes to write<br/>something original and become a so-called professional writer. . .<br/>this is just practice.<p>Chapter 5<p>- Other's First Day -<p>Akane was not happy to see the school gates as she, Ranma, and<br/>Cologne approached the grounds. She was so small and weak compared to<br/>what she was before, not that she was so large to begin with, and it<br/>made her nervous. She was technically a year younger than everyone<br/>else in her class and her growth spurt hadn't originally started<br/>until she was thirteen last time.<p>As they passed through the gates she quickly informed her travelling<br/>companions that she had to find her own classroom before she walked<br/>off in a different direction. She knew this school's layout fairly<br/>well so it wasn't hard to get there in little time. She walked in and<br/>immediately looked to the front blackboard knowing that in the first<br/>year the seating was set for the first term as the younger students<br/>weren't use to high school yet. Her desk was farther to the back then<br/>she ever really liked, the bad students usually tried hiding in the<br/>back as they were often ignored there. Looking for the corresponding<br/>desk she saw a group people gathered in the area, and another girl<br/>already sitting in her desk.<p>Walking up to the group a little nervously, as the others were all<br/>boys who looked too old for the first year, Akane stopped in front of<br/>her desk and stated to the girl who was blatantly ignoring her,<br/>"Excuse me but the board says that this is my desk."<p>"Bug off little girl," the girl waved off Akane without even looking<br/>at her causing the several of the boys to try not to laugh and<br/>Akane's anger to start to rise.<p>The oldest, and strongest looking, boy looked at her for a moment<br/>straight faced not seemingly joining his friends attempts not to<br/>laugh then turned his attention back to the group.<p>"I don't know where your desk is but it's not this one," Akane<br/>stated firmly as she narrowed her eyes at the brown haired girl's<br/>head.<p>"Listen, baby cunt, this is now my desk so find another!" the girl<br/>turned and glared threateningly at Akane barely causing her short<br/>spiky hair move.<p>Akane was taken slightly back by the language from the other girl<br/>but it made her anger rise farther and stand with her fists clenched<br/>at her sides. The girl looked at the site and gave a short laugh as<br/>she mockingly rubbed her eyes with her own fists, "Awww, baby cunt<br/>gonna cry."<p>The girl barely had time to reacted as she noticed a fist coming<br/>straight for her face but she nothing to really worry about as it was<br/>easily caught by the oldest boy. The boy grabbed the hand as if it<br/>was so very slow then wrenched Akane's arm up behind her back,<br/>"Little girls should know better then to throw tantrums."<p>"Let go of me!" Akane shouted louder then she planned to as the boy<br/>made sure her arm really hurt, and was basically useless at the<br/>moment.<p>"What are we going to do with the baby cunt?" the girl smirked<br/>evilly as she ran her hand over Akane's cheeks causing Akane to<br/>flinch back at the perverted action.<p>"Guri we both know what happens to little girls who are bad don't<br/>we," the boy replied not giving any emotion with his face although it<br/>was clearly in his voice. Giving Akane's arm another sharp twist he<br/>made her lean over the desk using her other arm to try to stop him<br/>forcing her completely on the desk.<p>"Bad girls get spanked!" Guri answered loudly with a broad evil<br/>smile as she whipped her hand up and laid it down with all her might<br/>on Akane's exposed panty clad ass causing a loud smack to echo<br/>throughout the classroom.<p>Akane tried to force herself up and scream something at the girl<br/>when another boy repeated what the girl, Guri, had done causing Akane<br/>to let out a burst of air in shock and do what came naturally, "Stop<br/>it!"<p>"Not until you have learned your lesson baby cunt," Guri replied as<br/>she brought her face in front of the somewhat prone Akane and smiled<br/>at the her stroking Akane's face again as another boy continued the<br/>spanking. "You don't mess with us. . . not unless you like to be<br/>spanked in front all your other classmates."<p>Akane's anger flared to it's highest levels as the girl accused her<br/>of being some kind of pervert. How dare such a bitch like this girl<br/>get off calling her a pervert! Akane started to glow red with anger<br/>then focussed it into her strength to finally pull away from the<br/>older boy before he could have his, and the final, chance at her<br/>backside. Standing upright quickly she turned the energy out like<br/>Ryoga had taught her to and focussed it at the girl making a ball of<br/>pure anger streak out and hit Guri full force. The girl went flying<br/>into the far wall and then slumped down to lay unconscious on the<br/>floor, two of the boys went to check on the her.<p>"What did you do to her!" the older boy demanded finally showing<br/>emotion on his face as he grabbed Akane's up raise hand. Akane felt<br/>the grip on her wrist again then spun around being prepared this time<br/>and threw a punch at the boy's face. The boy seemed surprise by the<br/>attack and it hit him in the right eye before he could stop it. Being<br/>unprepared for the contact with a fist from an unusually strong small<br/>girl the boy went flying to the other side of the room but he had<br/>enough sense left to flip back onto his feet before landing. The boy<br/>spun and prepared to get into a real fight with the girl but the<br/>teacher finally walked in and put a stop to that by simply asking<br/>what was going on. After a few minutes of trying to explain that<br/>nothing happened, and one of the boys getting Guri to the school<br/>nurse, they all were in their proper desks and the teacher started<br/>the class.<p>- - - -<p>Nodoka wasn't so sure about going to school again. She may look and<br/>like she was sixteen again, including her oversized bust she would<br/>have to grow back into again, but she was an adult woman. . . with a<br/>son who should be this age. But as she knew she would have to live<br/>with this for a time, and if there was anything she did well it was<br/>to strive and survive. If only they would have allowed her to bring<br/>her sword. . .<p>"Now Auntie there is a few things I need to warn you about. . ."<br/>Nabiki started cautiously but gave the girl a small evil smile as<br/>she, the young Nodoka, and Shampoo walked towards the school.<p>"Nabiki, dear, I told you to call me Nodoka for the time being.<br/>Calling me Auntie will just confuse people," Nodoka softly scolded as<br/>she straightened her school jumper.<p>"I still say you should go with the truth on this," Nabiki smirked.<br/>"Trust me, no one at Furinkin would blink twice at Ranma's mother<br/>having become a teenager again and being forced by Principal Kuno to<br/>attend classes."<p>"Mercenary girl right, Furinkin people crazy," Shampoo huffed as she<br/>walked behind the two a bit as she was not at all happy about being<br/>in the horrible looking jumper like the others.<p>"People at Furinkin as pretty sane compared to some people I know,"<br/>Nabiki countered snidely then gritted her teeth and added, "It would<br/>help if learned some better Japanese while you're in class, my name<br/>is Nabiki not 'Mercenary girl'."<p>Shampoo stuck her tongue out at the older girl.<p>"The only real problem I can see is that you look a lot like Ranma's<br/>girl form. . . with slightly less red hair and no pigtail," Nabiki<br/>got back to her original conversation ignoring Shampoo.<p>"Just remember the story, I'm Ranma's younger sister," Nodoka<br/>frowned as she didn't like the dishonesty but she didn't want to<br/>embarrass the family name too much with the truth.<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes but continued on without much more comment<br/>about the subject.<p>- - - -<p>The trio of girls approached the school gates and Nabiki stopped<br/>then and frowned about something and putting her hand out to halt the<br/>other two.<p>"Why Mercen. . . Why Nabiki stop Shampoo?" Shampoo looked crossly at<br/>the hand on her breast it was obvious that it was an accident. . .<br/>but Shampoo could never really be sure about that with Nabiki.<p>"Yes, why are suddenly looking so worried?" Nodoka asked looking<br/>concerned.<p>"Look at the gates," Nabiki replied as she pointed at the boy who<br/>was obviously waiting for someone as he wasn't staring out to the<br/>streets and not moving to get into the school yard.<p>"Hi Ya! That stick boy!" Shampoo exclaimed as she realized what the<br/>problem was and looked at Nodoka with concern. "Not good, Mother-in-<br/>law no know how to fight!"<p>"Shampoo!" Nodoka scolded loudly. "First, I am not you Mother-in-<br/>law! Akane is engaged to Ranma. Second, even though I am not on my<br/>husband's level of skill I am not defenceless! Genma did his best to<br/>teach me to at least defend myself."<p>"So you are good with that sword you're always carrying around?"<br/>Nabiki raised an eyebrow seeming to be impressed. Shampoo seemed<br/>happy about the news too.<p>"No, I know nothing of how to use that sword except which end to<br/>hold," Nodoka replied mater of factually.<p>Both girls suddenly dropped in shock then Nabiki asked as she<br/>started to get up, "Then why do you always carry it!"<p>"It scares Genma," Nodoka smirked evilly. "He doesn't know that I'm<br/>unskilled with it."<p>Shampoo and Nabiki gave each other confused and then Shampoo leaned<br/>over to whisper into Nabiki's ear, "Shampoo think something not<br/>right, Panda-man know enough to read skill with sword so how Nodoka<br/>fool him?"<p>Nabiki shrugged and vowed to confront the man when she could about<br/>that very matter.<p>"Now, if it is the Kuno boy you are worried about then I suggest we<br/>deal with him quickly or we will be late for class," Nodoka stated<br/>then started to walk towards the gates again. Shampoo and Nabiki<br/>shrugged and moved to catch up with the other girl.<p>Kuno was waiting for signs of Akane Tendo, any sign of Akane Tendo.<br/>He had read the resister and was related to see that the name of that<br/>accursed Ranma Saotome was missing from the list but he had little<br/>time to be happy as he couldn't find his beloved's name either. It<br/>had to be a mistake! After almost an hour of waiting, he got there<br/>very early, he spied someone who could clear things up. Preparing his<br/>wallet he imposed himself in the path of Nabiki Tendo and her two<br/>travelling companions, "Nabiki Tendo, I wish to know what heinous<br/>event has caused my beloved, Akane Tendo, to be missing from the<br/>school register and my noble presence?"<p>Nabiki cringed as both girls gave her hard looks, "Kuno baby,<br/>couldn't we talk about this later?"<p>"Nabiki Tendo I will not be brushed off! Truth be known I was made<br/>happy by the absence of that black sorcerer, Saotome, but. . but the<br/>lack of my sweet Akane's name is unacceptable!" Kuno ranted in near<br/>anger.<p>"My so. . brother is not a black sorcerer!" Nodoka corrected in<br/>anger, she nearly slipped but she couldn't allow this lout to say<br/>such things.<p>Kuno looked at the girl and blinked then blinked again until it<br/>finally clicked as to who was with Nabiki, "Pigtailed girl? I. . I<br/>did not recognize you as I rarely have seen you in a dress. . . have<br/>you changed your hair? It seems a little less fiery and lacks it's.<br/>. . pigtail."<p>"I am not you 'Pigtailed girl'! I am Ranma's moth. . sister, Nodoka<br/>Saotome, and I will thank you not to dishonour my family's name with<br/>such baseless accusations!" Nodoka's eyes flared at the boy, he wore<br/>the clothes of a samurai but obviously lacked honour, and people<br/>wondered why the old system started to break down.<p>"I. . I meant no dis. . I apologise but that peasant, Ranma Saotome,<br/>has wronged me and the noble house of Kuno too many times for me not<br/>to say his name with his crimes attached," Kuno started out a little<br/>confused as the girl looked so much like his Pigtailed goddess but<br/>the voice was a touch more. . . a touch more mature, and the way she<br/>acted was more. . . dignified. He remembered running into a couple of<br/>girls that looked like his two beloveds who were too young the other<br/>day and now again he was faced with another.<p>"Ranma is NOT a peasant! The Saotome family is a noble house!"<br/>Nodoka was in Kuno's face and very very angry. Nabiki gave the girl<br/>who was her aunt a little shocked glance as even she didn't know<br/>that. . . although it did explain the fact that there was a Saotome<br/>family katana.<p>"Surely you jest? I've met the vile boy's father and there is nae<br/>anything noble about the man," Kuno backed up slightly, shocked that<br/>the girl would confront him so. . . maybe his handsome visage had<br/>enchanted another.<p>"The Saotome name comes from my. . my mother's side of the family!"<br/>Nodoka really really wanted the family sword at the moment but then<br/>noticed that Kuno was carrying a well used bokken and she was glad<br/>she didn't have it, she might end up on her young tush if he had any<br/>skill with the wooden blade. "Genma was a Ronin that I. . Mother<br/>married to annoy her parents. Ranma is the heir to the family."<p>"I. . I see," Kuno said as she started to process what he was told.<br/>He may be a little thick headed, and blind to most things, but he<br/>wasn't the idiot everyone thought he was, after all he was in the top<br/>of his class. . . without cheating or paying off the teachers. "I<br/>will have to think about this. . ."<p>Nodoka looked proud of herself as she and the other girls moved<br/>around Kuno and started to walk into the schoolyard. Nabiki was about<br/>to ask her aunt about what was said about noble houses when Kuno<br/>interrupted them again, "Wait, I have another question of you."<p>Nodoka sighed with her head down before turning to face him again,<br/>"What is it now? We have to get to class."<p>"I find myself now very confused. I know you are not my red-haired<br/>pigtailed goddess, even though you are the very split image of her,"<br/>Kuno started with a very odd frown on his face looking like he was<br/>trying to work things out for a change. "If you are Ranma Saotome's<br/>sister. . . then what relation is she to him?"<p>"A girl about my height with fiery red hair and wears her hair and<br/>clothes like my so. . brother?" Nodoka tried to clarify and received<br/>a nod from Kuno. "That IS Ranma."<p>"Nay. I don't understand what you mean," Kuno replied as confused as<br/>he sounded. "She has at times called herself Ranma. . . and Nabiki<br/>Tendo once said that they are of one mind and one body. . but that<br/>was due to his dark control of the girl!"<p>"Have you not seen his. . our father change into a panda? Or the<br/>Chinese boy change into a duck?" Nodoka asked through gritted teeth.<br/>"Those are results of a curse gained in China, and Ranma is<br/>unfortunately cursed as well. . . to become a girl against his<br/>wishes."<p>"A curse. . ." Kuno repeated dumbstruck as Nodoka spun on her heals<br/>and walked away.<p>"I doubt that worked, we've been trying to tell him that for a year<br/>now," Nabiki smirked at the bizarre reaction from Kuno.<p>"No you haven't," Nodoka stated sounding angry again. "You have been<br/>purposely misleading that boy to make a profit off my son. . brother.<br/>You have gone out of your way to make Ranma's life a living hell in<br/>the past year."<p>"Mother-in. . . Nodoka tell truth," Shampoo agreed correcting<br/>herself when Nodoka frowned at the girl.<p>Nabiki stopped in shock, she had only done what was necessary to<br/>make sure the household survived.<p>- - - -<p>The classes went relatively smoothly for Nodoka as she was a year<br/>behind were Ranma should have been and her fellow students were in<br/>Junior High the year before. She did realize that she would have to<br/>readjust herself to the girls her now current age as she was lost in<br/>the several conversations she tried joining around her.<p>Shampoo's classes weren't as smooth. Her classmates knew her.<p>Most were surprised that she was going to the school at all, and the<br/>only ones brave enough to talk to her just wanted to know where Ranma<br/>and Akane were. Sayuri and Yuka wouldn't let up on her, both<br/>believing Shampoo had done something fowl with Akane regardless of<br/>Shampoo's protests.<p>Nabiki's day started off bad. She couldn't find anything to lay bets<br/>on, or at least nothing anyone would bother betting on. She spent<br/>most of the morning suffering the glares from Kuno, who sat behind<br/>her this year, because their stupid Home room teacher wanted to<br/>'jive' things up this year. She had watched Kuno confront Ranma's old<br/>friends as they had come through the gates, he didn't seem to like<br/>what the answers to the questions he asked but he let them go<br/>unharmed. Kuno had also stopped Akane's friends with what she<br/>expected were the same questions, and he seemed to get nearly the<br/>same answers.<p>It was during the break before the class before lunch that Kuno no<br/>longer held his tongue.<p>"Nabiki Tendo. . . is it true?" Kuno asked neither sounding angry<br/>nor crazed as he put a thousand yen note on Nabiki's shoulder.<p>Nabiki took the offered yen but didn't turn around, "You had better<br/>explain what you want to know is true or not so I can answer the<br/>question properly."<p>"That may have been a big part of the problem before. . ." Kuno<br/>sounded very depressed. . . and very sane.<p>That did cause Nabiki to turn around and raise an eyebrow at the<br/>Kendoist, "You're not yourself today, what gives?"<p>"I'm not sure I know what you mean," Kuno said calmly never breaking<br/>his stare into Nabiki's eyes. "What I want to know is. . . is it true<br/>that my 'Pigtailed girl' is only a cursed form of Ranma Saotome?"<p>Nabiki didn't want to give up on finding out what had changed the<br/>clueless to the clued but Kuno had finally asked his question and he<br/>had paid for an answer. She sighed before looking back at him, "Sorry<br/>Kuno, the answer is yes. It's not something he's comfortable with<br/>either."<p>Kuno's expression never changed but something died in his eyes, only<br/>to spark again with something new. Nabiki too another large yen note<br/>as he asked a slightly unexpected question, "His younger sister. . .<br/>Nodoka I believe is her name, is she currently attached in any way?<br/>Did her family engage her like they did her brother?"<p>"She isn't attached. . . although she just broke off a long standing<br/>relationship," Nabiki replied noting he gave her enough yen for two<br/>questions. "She has no outstanding engagements that I know of. . .<br/>but knowing her *Father* there might be one or two that haven't shown<br/>up yet."<p>"She isn't similarly cursed as the Pigtailed. . as Ranma is?" Kuno<br/>passed another yen note.<p>Nabiki took this one almost reluctantly before replying, "She<br/>doesn't have a curse. . . but she has been effected by magic<br/>recently. I don't think you have a chance there Kuno baby."<p>Nothing continued between the two for several minutes before Nabiki<br/>finally realized something and felt stupid that it took her so long.<br/>Turning around she put a concerned face on, "I noticed you haven't<br/>asked where either Ranma or Akane is since this morning when Nodoka<br/>distracted you. . . something wrong?"<p>"Akane Tendo. . ." Kuno started looking like he was about to return<br/>to his old self but then his eyes cleared. "I was only looking for<br/>her to. . to apologize. I know she held no affection for me and I<br/>kept pushing without seeing it. I suspect that since both she and<br/>Saotome are missing that they are off celebrating a wedding. . . or<br/>celebrating avoiding another wedding attempt by their fathers."<p>Nabiki had to fight off a burst of laughter before giving the story<br/>that was worked out, "Ranma went back to China to find a cure for his<br/>curse and Daddy wouldn't let him go without taking Akane with him. .<br/>. to keep the girls off him. They convinced both Daddy and Uncle<br/>Saotome not to force them to marry before they left."<p>"I see," Kuno said calmly as the next teacher came into the room and<br/>made it difficult to continue the discussion.<p>- - - -<p>"I'm telling you that Kuno's got a thing for you," Nabiki repeated<br/>to Nodoka as she sat down in the school cafeteria, a place neither<br/>Akane nor Ranma really like as it was too confining to fight in. "And<br/>he doesn't take 'no' well."<p>"Stick boy not understand no at all," Shampoo added with a frown<br/>directed at the food she had bought out of curiosity about what the<br/>school served.<p>"I'm sure you are both exaggerating. . . but Ranma, and Akane,<br/>warned me about him. I don't plan to lead him on," Nodoka said calmly<br/>as she opened her bento instead of getting any of the school food.<p>"You don't have to, he'll lead himself on," Nabiki warned then<br/>frowned as she spotted the person in question walk into the<br/>cafeteria. "Although he's been acting a little more like a normal<br/>person today. . . and that is strange for him."<p>"Nabiki Tendo, Xain Pu of the Joketsuzoku tribe, I would like to<br/>talk to Miss Saotome alone for a few minutes," Kuno stated as she<br/>came to the table. He didn't have his normal level of arrogance in<br/>voice and Nabiki really really wanted to know why.<p>Nabiki gave Nodoka a questioning look then motioned to Shampoo when<br/>Nodoka nodded, "We'll be nearby if you need us."<p>Shampoo picked up her tray and followed Nabiki to another table,<br/>"Did not know Stick boy knew Shampoo's name. . ."<p>"And he said it right, including where you come from. I really need<br/>to know how," Nabiki's eyes furrowed as she started eating.<p>"What do you want to talk about Kuno-sempai?" Nodoka asked finally<br/>acknowledging the older boy.<p>Kuno sat down across from the girl that looked so much like the girl<br/>he cared for and set himself for what he had to say. Straightening he<br/>looked at Nodoka in all seriousness, "First I should apologize to<br/>your family, if your brother were here I would do it to him directly.<br/>It seems that everyone I have talked to seems to know about the<br/>curse, and his dislike of it, and I accused him of things that he had<br/>no control over."<p>"That's very noble of you Kuno-sempai," Nodoka said slightly<br/>shocked. "To tell the truth I was warned about you and your<br/>obsessions. . . especially since I look so much like my so. . brother<br/>when he is in his cursed form, but I don't see what they are talking<br/>about."<p>"You were not lied to Miss Saotome. . . I have until late suffered<br/>from a. . a curse of my own, a family curse that I have seen fit to<br/>finally deal with," Kuno looked unhappy about what he was explaining.<br/>"I'll never be completely free of it. . but it is manageable if I<br/>work at it."<p>"But to other matters, your brother's curse form struck a cord in me<br/>that I still feel. . . and your so close visage. . ." Kuno dropped<br/>his head for a moment and rubbed his forehead before looking<br/>apologetically at Nodoka again. "I am sorry again, I am making a fool<br/>of myself in front of you again. What I wish to offer is my<br/>friendship, and then latter if matters permit maybe more."<p>Nodoka was very shocked at this, it was a very tactful way to start<br/>a relationship and it was coming from someone who made Genma seem<br/>enlightened in matters regarding women, "That's. . that's very kind<br/>of you Kuno-sempai, but I'll need time to think about things."<p>"I guess that is the best I can hope for at this time," Kuno stood<br/>and gave the girl a small bow before walking off.<p>Nabiki and Shampoo moved back quickly having watched Kuno leave<br/>under his own power. Shampoo gave Nodoka an uncomfortable look,<br/>"Mother-in. . Nodoka have Stick boy bad."<p>"I haven't seen him this rational since. . ." Nabiki started then<br/>threw her hands over her mouth when she remembered his last rational<br/>moments.<p>"What is it dear? Since when?" Nodoka asked with the patience of a<br/>parent after giving Shampoo a nasty glare.<p>"It was during our first year here. Kuno got hurt badly during a<br/>kendo match and had an. . episode in the hospital. The doctors gave<br/>him some medicine and he acted very sane for several days before it<br/>wore off," Nabiki explained looking very sad. "He was very charming<br/>at the time. . . He just wouldn't take the damn medicine afterwards,<br/>no matter how much he was asked too. He just couldn't accept he had a<br/>problem. . ."<p>"So he's been slipped the medicine again?" Nodoka didn't sound too<br/>happy about the idea. "It'll mean he will flip back to his old self<br/>soon and he'll be as bad as I was warned he was. . . but with a<br/>fixation on me. . ."<p>"I don't think anyone slipped it to him. He had a medical order<br/>issued after the last time that no drugs were to be used again, he<br/>claimed he wanted nothing but herbal remedies," Nabiki replied then<br/>seemed to think about something. After a moment she gave the group<br/>and annoyed look and simply said, "Sasuke!"<p>"Yes, Miss Nabiki?" came a reply that caused Shampoo and Nodoka to<br/>jump slightly. Nabiki simply turned and looked at the small man. "Of<br/>what can I do for you?"<p>"You can explain the 'new' Kuno," Nabiki requested severely crossing<br/>her arms, "and don't try to hide behind it being family business, I<br/>have a few photos you don't what your master seeing."<p>Sasuke narrowed his eyes at the girl but chose to reply not sounding<br/>worried about the threat, "Master Kuno has chosen to start taking the<br/>medicine of his own free will."<p>"Why?" Nabiki's eyes widened, Kuno wasn't like that as it meant that<br/>he wasn't perfect in his own eyes.<p>"Master Kuno started taking the medicine after Mistress Kodachi was<br/>arrested during the break for attacking a fellow classmate," Sasuke<br/>sat down on the table after jumping up easily. "It was the only way<br/>she would agree to take her own prescribed medicine that she was<br/>ordered to by the courts.<p>"Kodachi was arrested? I didn't know. . ." Nabiki couldn't believe<br/>she had missed something so big. . . especially since it pertained to<br/>her family.<p>"Psycho girl go jail? Shampoo not know either," Shampoo blinked then<br/>smirked. "She no problem now."<p>"Mistress Kodachi is not in jail! As long as she takes her<br/>medication she is allowed to stay at home," Sasuke corrected<br/>forcibly. "Although it has left her as not much more then a zombie<br/>when she is even awake. . ."<p>"That is unfortunate to hear, she was such a. . . a spirited girl<br/>when I met her," Nodoka said trying to find the best word for things.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma, Akane, Nodoka, and Nabiki sat around the dinning table having<br/>gotten home a bit earlier and changed into regular clothing. The most<br/>that they could find in the house was some trays of snacks and a note<br/>saying to come to the Nekohanten for dinner later from Kasumi.<p>"I can't believe Kuno was so controlled," Akane said as she finished<br/>her little bun. "He wasn't like that a week ago."<p>"No but he was a little more controlled at the time," Ranma replied<br/>thankful that Kasumi had left individual trays and his had a lot more<br/>on it. "Last time he found a younger me he went overboard but a week<br/>ago he didn't get that bad."<p>"I guess," Akane grudgingly agreed.<p>"He offered me friendship until I was ready to date him," Nodoka bit<br/>into her meat bun with a bit of wonder as things seemed to taste<br/>better to her at this age.<p>"You're not seriously thinking. . .!" Ranma exclaimed in wide eyed<br/>panic but he was cut off by his mother.<p>"Ranma Kuno. . . has an odd ring to it," Nabiki joked and couldn't<br/>stop herself from laughing all the way to the ground at the nasty<br/>glare she received.<p>"Ranma could not take the Kuno name as he is the only heir to the<br/>Saotome clan," Nodoka corrected trying not to smirk at the boggled<br/>look she received.<p>"Great! Have your little fun, I'm going to go practice," Ranma<br/>stated as he suddenly bolted up and stormed out in anger.<p>"What caused that?" Nodoka asked bewildered as she watched her son<br/>leave.<p>"He's had a problem since Kuno declared his love for the 'Pigtailed<br/>girl'," Nabiki explained as she calmed herself down. "I think it hurt<br/>his manhood that the first person to tell him they loved him was<br/>another guy."<p>"I see," Nodoka said quietly as she continued to look at the walkway<br/>that lead to the Dojo.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma finished his ninth kata still not calm. He hated Kuno, not in<br/>the holding a grudge 'prepare to die' way, but in the way that made<br/>him never to want to be willingly around the guy. Now the bastard was<br/>hitting on his now young mother. . . and there was nothing he could<br/>really do about it. He was too young to show up as himself so Kuno<br/>knew his advances on Ranma's 'sister' wasn't welcomed.<p>"I see something's on your mind, what to talk about it?" Cologne<br/>cocked her head to one side at the boy as she stood in the doorway to<br/>the Dojo.<p>"It's Kuno," Ranma said in distaste as he set up to do another kata.<p>"I heard. Shampoo was quite vocal about it when she got to the<br/>restaurant. It seems as if the boy has finally gotten help for one of<br/>his problems," Cologne walked up beside Ranma and slowly started<br/>copying his moves.<p>"Yeah right! Then why make a pass at my mother!" Ranma stopped<br/>with his fists clenched at his sides.<p>"She looks like you, and you look incredible in either sex," Cologne<br/>gave him a small smile then she turned a little more serious. "He's<br/>just doing what a regular boy his age would do. . . and he was very<br/>tactful from what I hear, and that says a lot."<p>"Yeah, I know. . . but I can't even tell him what I think of it!"<br/>Ranma replied in anger as he pointed out his younger features. "He<br/>isn't going to believe this, and if he did he'd just start causing<br/>trouble that neither me or Akane need at the new school."<p>"Give the boy a chance, he might surprise both of us," Cologne<br/>stopped her own version of the kata Ranma was doing. "You could<br/>always phone him, your voice hasn't changed all that much."<p>"Call him. . ." Ranma said in a distant sort of way then grinned. "I<br/>can keep my distance and still keep track of him. . . and let him<br/>know it."<p>Cologne was slightly shocked when Ranma suddenly bolted out of the<br/>Dojo then shook it off as she should have expected it, "He really<br/>needs to learn patience."<p>"Oh well," Cologne shrugged and walked towards the living room to<br/>gather up the girls to head to Nekohanten for dinner.
