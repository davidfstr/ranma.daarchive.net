This is written<br/>for fun and not for any profit so please don't sue as I'm a poor<br/>writer who one day hopes to write something original and become a so<br/>called professional writer. . . this just practice.<p>Note: Not for the KotF out there as it is a R+C fic.<p>Chapter 3<p>[Draft Copy]<p>- Shopping for Teens -<p>"I can't believe it!" Ranma yelled in frustation as he walked away<br/>from the school with the group of girls. "It's like the universe was<br/>expectin' this!"<p>"I should not have gone," Nodoka said shaking her lowered head in<br/>disbelief as she reached the school gates.<p>"You shouldn't have gone! I'm stuck back in Junior High School!"<br/>Akane nearly screamed as she stormed past. "Unlike Ranma I have good<br/>grades! You'd think that a person with her problem would have<br/>understood! But noooo, she had to agree with Palm tree head!"<p>"Maybe because you acted like a two year old when you lost your<br/>temper at her," Nabiki replied daring Akane to answer that with a<br/>look. Akane kept her mouth shut.<p>"Hey, none of us were expecting Miss Hinako to be the new Principal<br/>of the Junior High School," Nabiki reminded the group. "I had planned<br/>on dealing with Principal Kuno not the Paedophile's Dream She Beast<br/>From Hell. The only one who came out ahead was Cologne!"<p>"I was simply enrolling," Cologne replied trying to look innocent.<br/>"At least you'll have a familiar face with you in class with you<br/>Ranma."<p>"But I'm a grade lower then Ranma!" Akane protested in anger.<p>"I was trying for at least first year in Furinkin," Ranma grumbled.<p>"Maybe if your grades had been better they might have agreed,"<br/>Nodoka scolded as they started on their way down the nearby street.<p>"Well we'll get ta see if ya can do better Mom," Ranma replied<br/>almost venomously. "Or should I say Sis?"<p>"I was embarrassed at the idea of what people would think of me<br/>knowing I had a teenage son at only sixteen," Nodoka blushed<br/>nervously.<p>"What, Besides the fact that it's impossible regardless what those<br/>sick perverts like to draw?" Nabiki smirked.<p>"And what should I have told them?" Nodoka asked sarcastically. "The<br/>truth?"<p>"Yes," Nabiki replied seriously as they entered the market area.<br/>"Miss Hinako was trained by Happosai after all."<p>"That explains a lot," Cologne said with her own smirk.<p>"Look at it this way people, you all are going to be the top of your<br/>classes without any effort. You'll get to kick back for awhile and<br/>have fun while other students struggle to keep up," Nabiki almost<br/>looked envious. "Heck even Ranma will do great this year since it's<br/>stuff he actually knows!"<p>"You mean more excuses for him to sleep in class," Kasumi corrected<br/>as she lead Akane along with an arm around her shoulder comforting<br/>her from Nabiki's earlier jibs.<p>"I don't sleep in class out of choice! People keep waking me up all<br/>night long, then Pop always wants to train early!" Ranma protested.<p>"I believe clothes was next on the agenda," Cologne changed the<br/>subject as they stopped outside a nice women's store.<p>- - - -<p>"Well it does look nice on you Akane, but. . . do you really want a<br/>foreign girl's picture on your clothes?' Nodoka asked a little<br/>concerned sitting at the table near the change booths where parents<br/>could have tea while their children tried on clothes.<p>"It's Nadia! She's a cool acrobatic fighting girl," Akane beemed as<br/>she looked at the shirt in the mirror with the matching skirt. "I've<br/>wanted stuff with her on it since I saw her. . . I was just too<br/>embarrassed to wear it 'cause it was kid stuff."<p>"And now you're a kid," Nabiki smirked evily at Akane's hurt face.<br/>She was feelin a little vindictive at the moment since it turned out<br/>Cologne hadn't been joking about buying for everyone but her. She<br/>almost felt bad about the comment seeing her little sister start to<br/>screw up her face to start crying. Almost, but not quite.<p>"Nabiki, act your age," Nodoka scolded giving the girl a nasty look.<p>A few minutes later as Akane was trying on another outfit Cologne<br/>dragged Ranma-chan to the other girls. Ranma-chan was less then happy<br/>to be anywhere near a woman's clothing store and Cologne wasn't<br/>making things any better.<p>"My, that looks. . . less then manly," Nodoka said looking at her<br/>son. . daughter over. "But it is nice."<p>Ranma-chan looked down at her outfit out of reflex even though she<br/>knew what she looked like already. The soft blue overalls were cut in<br/>what the saleslady called capri style so they only came down to mid<br/>calf. A soft red, almost pink, t-shirt with the character for wild on<br/>it in black that was a little tight but obviously cut for her chest<br/>size was tucked into the overalls. The soft kung-fu shoes she had on<br/>were the same shade of red as the shirt, the colour bothered her a<br/>bit but liked the knowledge that she could get other colours then<br/>just black. . . even if she had to buy them in a woman's store. She'd<br/>seen a deep blue and a fiery red set that both would look great with<br/>her silks.<p>"Ranma only needs a little nudge from time to time, he has great<br/>fashion sense for a man," Cologne smiled showing off her twin set in<br/>the reverse order of colours with the character for fun on her shirt.<p>"When she isn't trying too hard to look like a stereo type," Akane<br/>added as she came out of the change booth wearing jeans that came<br/>only to the knees and a baseball t-shirt of the Tigers. "Then she<br/>looks either like a tramp or like Azusa."<p>"That wasn't my idea," Ranma-chan complained fingering her pony-tail<br/>as Cologne also talked her into untying her pig-tail. She looked very<br/>nervous.<p>"She's just worried that you are going to demand her head for<br/>wearing any outfit a normal girl would choose," Cologne explained to<br/>Nodoka as she sat down at the small tea table and poured herself a<br/>cup.<p>"I declared Ranma manly months ago. I could hardly do otherwise what<br/>with all his girlfriends," Nodoka replied with a smirk. "But I guess<br/>I should find her a nice boy to increase the chances of<br/>grandchildren. That Hibiki boy seemed nice. . ."<p>"I am not dating Ryouga!" Ranma-chan looked shocked.<p>"At least not again, right Ranma?" Akane said with an evil smirk.<p>"That's right! Not again. . . That's not what I meant!" Ranma-chan<br/>agreed then realized the trap she tripped into a little too late as<br/>the other started giggling.<p>"Uhm. . . I don't think this fits right Ms. Cologne. . ." Kasumi<br/>said nevouslyas she walked up behind Ranma-chan causing everyone but<br/>Cologne to gasp. Ranma-chan turned and her eyes widened in shock,<br/>Kasumi was wearing a soft cream and jade edged Chinese pantsuit that<br/>proved she hadn't neglected her figure in the past few years.<p>"It fits perfectly," Cologne waved Kasumi's concern off while<br/>sipping her tea and trying not to smile. "And it is a requirement for<br/>your new posistion at the Nekohanten."<p>"And just what is that position?" Nabiki cocked an eyebrow as she<br/>hadn't heard word one about this.<p>"She'll be running the restaurant while I'm in school," Cologne<br/>replied smiling. "I neither trust Shampoo nor Mr. Parttime to work<br/>effectively together while I'm away so I need a level head there."<p>"And she can use the money to pay for College afterwards," Nodoka<br/>added showing she had a part in this.<p>"And of course to help out the household too Aunty," Kasumi smiled<br/>then looked at the pantsuit again. "But are you truly sure this isn't<br/>improper?"<p>"It'll draw crowds," Cologne chuckled then looked at Ranma-chan.<br/>"There's always an after school position open for you too Ranma."<p>"Not after last time," Ranma-chan cringed.<p>"That was to teach you a lesson," Cologne smirked then shook her<br/>head slightly. "A much oft ignored lesson unfortunately."<p>"Hey! I learned the Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken!" Ranma-chan protested.<p>"The lesson was not to mess with a Chinese Amazon Elder," Cologne<br/>corrected. "How was I to know that this boy had the heart of an<br/>Amazon woman?"<p>"Hey! I'm a guy!" Ranma-chan protested again louder.<p>"How about a little louder next time, Ranma, I don't think the<br/>people in the next store heard you that time," Nabiki said<br/>sarcastically as she rolled her eyes.<p>"I'm sure Cologne meant that as a compliment dear," Nodoka smiled<br/>comfortingly. "Even if it is an odd one."<p>"It was," Cologne confirmed. "If I thought anything but the best<br/>about you and your skills I would never have taught you Amazon<br/>secrets."<p>"Um. . thanks, but I'm still a guy," Ranma-chan replied trying to<br/>ignore the clothes she was wearing at the moment. The others started<br/>laughing for a few minutes.<p>- - - -<p>"I can't believe we bought so much!" Akane stated as she held up her<br/>six bags of clothes.<p>"Oh yeah rub it in why don't you," Nabiki nearly snarled then smiled<br/>evilly. "I can't believe how much of a clothes horse Ranma is."<p>"Hey! I had to buy for two forms," Ranma complained trying to keep<br/>all twelve bags balanced. "Not that I wanted too! Cologne just<br/>wouldn't buy me guy clothes with me getting girl clothes first."<p>"But you looked so cute in that outfit that we just had to get you<br/>some more," Nodoka smiled carrying her own bags. "How do you expect<br/>to attract a boy without the proper clothes?"<p>"The same way she always does, by flaunting her body barely<br/>dressed," Akane replied evilly as she skipped down the street towards<br/>home then stopped when she realized what she was doing and started to<br/>walk normally.<p>"I DON'T WANT TO ATTRACT ANY BOYS!" Ranma-chan screamed drawing<br/>the attention of others on the streets.<p>"No, of course not dear," Nodoka agreed in a parental patronizing<br/>tone then leaned close to Kasumi and Cologne. "They tend to be that<br/>way at her age."<p>"Some just don't seem to be able to grow out of it," Kasumi nodded<br/>slightly towards Akane.<p>"Oh! I forgot something! I'll catch up with you back at home,"<br/>Nodoka said suddenly before turning and walking back the way they had<br/>come disappearing quickly.<p>"Excuse me, Kasumi Tendo, I do not mean to intrude on you and your<br/>friends," Kuno said as he approached the group after spying both<br/>Kasumi and Nabiki. At first he thought he had also seen his two<br/>loves, Akane and the pig-tailed goddess, but as he came closer he<br/>realized these two were too young to be them. . . maybe younger<br/>Cousins of his loves destined to be as lovely one day. "But would you<br/>happen to know. . ."<p>"Oh look it's Kuno-baby," Nabiki said sarcastically crossing her<br/>arms as Ranma-chan and Akane cringed.<p>"I was not speaking to you Nabiki Tendo, I was asking your sweet<br/>sister where my two loves are as I was told that they travelled with<br/>her today," Kuno stated arrogantly.<p>Kasumi was glad she wasn't wearing the Chinese pantsuit with this. .<br/>person around, all they needed was him chasing another member of the<br/>household. Smiling she gave a blank look before replying, "I really<br/>don't know. . . I haven't seen 'your two loves' since yesterday. I<br/>think they went with Ranma looking for a special mushroom. Yes, I'm<br/>sure you won't see them again until they find the mushroom they are<br/>looking for."<p>"Alas no! The evil fiend is again trying to weave his spell of<br/>enslavement over my loves! This mushroom must be some fiendish<br/>ingredient to a potion of domination to subvert my goddesses from<br/>their true love!" Kuno ranted beseeching heaven no less then three<br/>times with motions. Grasping Kasumi's hands he pleaded, "Oh sweet<br/>woman I beseech you, tell me wher they travel so I can save them from<br/>Ranma's evil?"<p>"I think I heard something about Brazil," Ranma-chan offered with an<br/>innocent look. "Or was it Siberia?"<p>"Oh thank you cherub of loveliness! Were you older you'd rival my<br/>pig-tailed goddess in beauty!" Kuno quickly grasped Ranma-chan's<br/>hands and kissed her forehead. . . then went flying when Ranma-chan<br/>kicked him into near orbit.<p>"Damn! Not as strong as I use to be!" Ranma-chan cursed as she<br/>watched Kuno's trajectory.<p>"Watch you language dear, that wasn't very lady like," Nodoka<br/>scolded as she rejoined the group and watched Kuno hit the descending<br/>point of his arc.<p>"I ain't a lady!" Ranma-chan protested out of reflex.<p>"You needn't have worried, Ranma can attract boys even without the<br/>extra help," Kasumi commented to Nodoka causing some giggling.<p>"The only thing that can't attract Kuno is Nabiki," Ranma-chan<br/>stated in annoyance.<p>"Hey! I don't want him either!" Nabiki turned in shock only to<br/>receive an extended tongue from Ranma-chan cauding the giggling to<br/>turn to laughter.<p>- - - -<p>Author's Notes: This is just the draft copy as someone is proofing<br/>it as I write this, I'm puting it out for those to enjoy while the<br/>edited version is being worked on.
