</div>A Ranma 1 / 2 Alternate Histories Company Presents:<p>Cologne for Teens<p>By Felix Webster ( Felix Warstar )<br/>[felix_]<p>Disclaimer: All original Ranma ½ Characters and Back story Copyright<br/>Rumiko Takahashi. This is written for fun and not for any profit so<br/>please don't sue as I'm a poor writer who one day hopes to write<br/>something original and become a so-called professional writer. . .<br/>this is just practice.<p>Chapter 4<p>- School for the Mentally Insane -<p>"Kasumi? Have you seen my scarf?" Akane asked almost in a panic as<br/>she ran into the livingroom wearing the black and white sailor school<br/>uniform with the green edging that looked a little short on her.<p>"I was just sewing your name into it," Kasumi smiled as she handed<br/>the white and green scarf to Akane who flipped it over to read 'Akane<br/>Tendo of the Tendo School of Anything Goes Martial Arts' with the<br/>address and phone number stitched in a very nice lettering.<p>"Thanks Kasumi," Akane hugged her older sister then took her seat at<br/>the table to start eating. She looked around confused, "Where's<br/>everyone else?"<p>- - - -<p>"Are you absolutely sure about this?" Genma asked his young wife as<br/>they sat in the Dojo. He was thankful they had gotten the roof<br/>finished during the week as it was lightly raining outside. . . now<br/>they just had to deal with the leaks.<p>"I am positive," Nodoka replied as she signed her name to the papers<br/>in front of her. "I do not need the added problems of being a married<br/>High School student, at least not to someone old enough to be my own<br/>Father. . . it wouldn't look proper."<p>"But. . . this could lead to complications," Genma protested looking<br/>very concerned at his wife who was wearing the standard Furinkin<br/>jumper.<p>"Do not worry yourself, you will not be taken off the Saotome family<br/>register as you have helped produce a male heir for my line," Nodoka<br/>reassured the large man. "This is just until I have either found a<br/>way to undo this or have finished high school again. . . as long as<br/>it is still agreeable to remarry at that time."<p>"I still don't know about all this," Genma said as he looked at the<br/>divorce papers that Nodoka passed him. "What about Ranma?"<p>"Ranma is an adult, regardless of his current age, and it may even<br/>ease some of his worries as he as I no longer can take your head,"<br/>Nodoka said with a small smile. "You are free of all debts, pledges,<br/>and obligations to me with this. . . save the obligation of family."<p>"Yes, but that is a lifetime debt all have to suffer unless they<br/>Ronin themselves," Genma said sadly thinking about his own past as he<br/>started signing the papers.<p>"Will you ever tell Ranma about that?" Nodoka asked raising an<br/>eyebrow.<p>"Do I have to leave?" Genma asked ignoring the question indicating<br/>the Dojo and House.<p>"It is Soun's home, but it would be for the best. I do not want any<br/>interruptions as I train Ranma in my 'Saotome' family style," Nodoka<br/>almost looked sad about asking him to go. "But you and Soun have to<br/>get started on the Saotome family home as it is which should take<br/>months to finish. . . and it might do Soun good to get out of this<br/>area for a time."<p>"He needs a woman," Genma said firmly as he handed back the papers<br/>back. "It's been too long."<p>"Then take him looking for one," Nodoka knew he meant a woman more<br/>then for a night as Genma may be crude but he held a few things<br/>sacred. She put the papers into her satchel and stood dusting herself<br/>off trying to hide the unhappiness in her eyes with a look of<br/>sternness and being proper. She turned and walked to the Dojo<br/>entrance before adding, "You are also no longer bound by 'that'<br/>pledge either."<p>- - - -<p>"Why do I have ta wear a uniform? It won't fit if I change inta<br/>girl!" Ranma complained pulling the black jacket out slightly in<br/>disgust. He really hated the fact it had short black pants and a<br/>white scarf with green edging around the neck of the black shirt then<br/>the fact he had to wear one. . . he was too old for short pants!<p>"If I have to wear a uniform then you have to wear one, it is only<br/>proper," Nodoka replied sternly even though she just wanted to sigh<br/>in defeat. "You could always go as a girl in Akane's spare sailor<br/>suit instead."<p>"No. . . this uniform's. . okay I guess. I'll just try ta work with<br/>it when I change," Ranma said almost in a panic.<p>"Ranma, please remember to speak properly, I'm finding your lack of<br/>verbal skills to be very embarrassing," Nodoka scolded as she started<br/>eating her breakfast ignoring Akane sticking her tongue out at her<br/>son in response to his cringe. "Cologne will be here in a minute to<br/>walk with you to the school so get your satchel."<p>"You don't want to be late on the first day," Akane stuck her tongue<br/>out at Ranma again.<p>"Ya. . you might want to hurry too as the Junior High is farther<br/>away then Furinkin," Ranma replied between bites quirking a smile.<p>"Damn! I forgot!" Akane bolted upright and ran for the door with her<br/>bag.<p>"She forgot you and her go to the same school?" Kasumi asked<br/>watching her little sister leave at blinding speed.<p>"She's just lucky Miss Hinako decided she was twelve and not eleven<br/>so she didn't have to go to the Elementary school instead," Ranma<br/>said calmly as he concentrated on his words. Standing up he put his<br/>rice bowl down and grabbed his satchel, "I guess we should go too."<p>Cologne watched bemused as the young Akane Tendo ran past with a<br/>quick 'Hi Cologne, Bye Cologne!' without pausing in her high speed<br/>running. The girl was in a mad rush to get to the school and Cologne<br/>wasn't about to stop her. Walking towards the Tendo gate she smirked<br/>at the uncomfortable Shampoo walking with her, she pulled at the<br/>Furinkin jumper in disgust, "It was you own fault when you hit that<br/>Truancy Officer when he asked you which school you were going too."<p>"Shampoo is not Japanese! Shampoo finished with school in village!"<br/>Shampoo stated in anger.<p>"And the local school council doesn't recognize that education,"<br/>Cologne reminded trying not to laugh at the purple haired girl. "And<br/>I would not expect less from a council headed by Principal Kuno and<br/>Miss. . Principal Hinako, neither is mentally all there."<p>"At least Shampoo is not in class with angry girl!" Shampoo smirked<br/>as she remembered the younger Akane heading in the other direction.<p>As they reached the Tendo Gate they were met by Ranma, Nodoka, and<br/>Nabiki. Cologne smiled at the group as Nabiki waved at them, "I see<br/>Akane is eager to start her classes today."<p>Ranma had to stop and blink a few times as the sight of the young<br/>Cologne in the black and white school sailor suit left him speechless<br/>for a minute. Cologne started to get slightly nervous that something<br/>was off and looked down at herself, "What? Am I wearing it wrong?"<p>"I think that's Ranma's way of saying you look cute," Nabiki replied<br/>with a smirk.<p>"With your hair done up in those two buns you look like you have<br/>short hair," Nodoka smiled as she put a hand through her own short<br/>auburn hair. "Ranma has always liked short hair on women. . . ever<br/>since he was a little baby."<p>"Really?" Cologne raised an eyebrow as Ranma blushed. "I'll have to<br/>remember that, but why did Akane leave already? I thought we were<br/>walking together?"<p>"Ranma reminded her that the Junior High was farther away and Akane<br/>must have forgot that you and Ranma are going to the same school,"<br/>Nabiki explained with an evil little smile.<p>"Ranma is learning some bad manners in this house," Nodoka stated<br/>with a frown.<p>"At least he's learning," Nabiki shrugged the started towards the<br/>High School. "Come on Aun. . Nodoka-chan I want to get to school<br/>early, I have things to. . . set up for the day."<p>"Shampoo walk with you too as Shampoo stuck going to school too,"<br/>Shampoo replied quickly as she moved over to Nabiki trying not to<br/>shudder at the sight of a younger Ranma.<p>"Have a good day at school you two," Nodoka offered as she ran to<br/>catch up with Nabiki and Shampoo and then walked off with the pair<br/>down the street.<p>"Why is it that people forget how old you truly are if you look<br/>younger?" Ranma asked referring to Shampoo's reaction to him confused.<p>"I don't know her problem with this, Ranma, but she has also been<br/>told that you weren't hers anymore and isn't taking it well," Cologne<br/>replied and she turned and started to walk towards the Junior High.<br/>"I guess we should catch up with Akane. Over land or by roof?"<p>"Roof of course!" Ranma shouted as he leapt onto the first house in<br/>the right direction, quickly followed by Cologne.<p>They found Akane a few minutes later stopped by a pole looking<br/>around confused. Landing behind her Ranma cocked his head to one side<br/>and tried looking concerned, "Got lost?"<p>"Ranma!" Akane jumped nearly out of her skin and landed in a<br/>defensive stance. She relaxed when Cologne hopped down beside Ranma.<br/>Akane blushed from embarrassment as she replied, "I can't believe I<br/>forgot the way."<p>"You also forgot we go to the same school," Cologne added with<br/>smile. "Come on, I know the way as I figured one of us should."<p>Ranma, Cologne, and Akane continued on, soon met by other students<br/>going to the same school. Reaching the school Akane parted company to<br/>find to her own class as Ranma and Cologne headed up a floor to<br/>theirs.<p>"What the heck is up with Akane? She's been like that all week<br/>around me," Ranma asked as he picked a desk in the middle of the row<br/>next to the window. It was early enough that both Ranma and Cologne<br/>had the pick of just about any desk they wanted. "Every time she<br/>thinks we're alone she gets scared and defensive."<p>"I'm not sure, but she is younger than you now. . . maybe she was<br/>just scared at that age of anyone older trying to take advantage of<br/>her because she was too weak?" Cologne replied with a shrug as she<br/>sat down in the desk beside Ranma's and marked it on the blackboard<br/>by throwing the chalk sitting on the desk at the right spot on the<br/>chart.<p>"Oh, you what a challenge huh?" Ranma smirked as he grabbed all the<br/>pieces from the desk nearby and started throwing piece after piece at<br/>the blackboard leaving a crude set of characters saying 'Ra n ma'. He<br/>turned and gave Cologne a smug look and offered her the chalk he<br/>hadn't used.<p>Cologne raised an eyebrow as she took the chalk and started throwing<br/>the pieces herself. When she was done her spot had a nice design that<br/>read 'Ku Lon', "Penmanship counts as two points."<p>Those who had already come into the room stared in disbelief at the<br/>display of skill, and the two who did it laughing their heads off<br/>about it. There was only two things a person did with Martial<br/>Artists, either avoid them like death himself or befriend them<br/>quickly. . . in Nerima avoiding was the best policy.<p>"That was fun," Cologne said coming back from gathering up the chalk<br/>they had thrown and handing them to Ranma.<p>"Yes it was. You! What's your name?" Ranma pointed to a short boy<br/>with glasses who had just taken the first desk in Ranma's row.<p>"Me! Eep! It's. . It's Jin. . ." the boy looked nervous like a deer<br/>caught in the headlights knowing it was about to die now.<p>"Don't move," Ranma smirked as he started throwing the chalk around<br/>the boy's head to mark the name on the proper position on the board<br/>looking only a little neater then last time, "Obstacles count as<br/>double points."<p>Cologne laughed as she took the horde of chalk again and looked at<br/>the black-haired girl who sat down on her other side who said 'Mai'<br/>in surprise, she started throwing the pieces so that they would<br/>bounce off the side blackboard before hitting the right stop then<br/>bounce back to Cologne, "Style also counts as double points."<p>Ranma was about to stand up to get some more chalk as the horde was<br/>getting overused when he was handed a new pile from a smiling brunet<br/>girl who promptly sat down in front of him and said, "Yuri"<p>By the time the Homeroom teacher came into the room the chalk was<br/>flying everywhere and bouncing back to two students who kept chucking<br/>out new pieces around the room. The front blackboard had every<br/>students name on it with their last names added and the side<br/>blackboard had a small map of the Nerima district with a marked<br/>location showing where the Nekohanten was compared to the school.<br/>Cologne's were neatly styled with a flare for design and Ranma's<br/>showed great improvement to almost the level of Cologne's first few<br/>tries.<p>"What's going on here!" the teacher shouted causing Ranma to miss<br/>a returning piece which Cologne had to catch before it hit anyone<br/>else.<p>"It was incredible Miss Kuno! They were writing all our names on the<br/>board!" replied a short boy seated on the far side of Ranma and<br/>Cologne as he ran up to the tall raven-haired woman.<p>"Kuno!" both Ranma and Cologne exclaimed in shock then realized<br/>the woman looked simular to Kodachi, just older and a much more<br/>conservative taste in clothing. Both dropped their heads in<br/>depression, "We're doomed!"<p>"I told you before, Hiro, that my name is Miss Ingawara now and not<br/>Kuno," the woman stated sternly as she put her briefcase on the front<br/>podium and straightened her black suit jacket over her medium length<br/>black skirt. "I have nothing to do with that insane family!"<p>"You two!" Miss Ingawara said as she moved between the two rows and<br/>looked sternly at Ranma and Cologne causing them to look slightly<br/>nervous. She pointed at the board behind her without turning, "Who<br/>has that atrocious handwriting?"<p>Ranma raised his hand slowly and Cologne stuck her tongue out at<br/>him. Miss Ingawara narrowed her eyes slightly but smile evilly, "Miss<br/>Ku Lon it'll be your responsibility to improve Mister Saotome's<br/>handwriting by the end of the term to a level I find befitting a High<br/>school student. You aren't in Elementary any more Mister Saotome and<br/>it's time you learned that."<p>Cologne was about to argue with the teacher about the extra duties<br/>but one look at Ranma's wide-eyed attempt to not laugh made it<br/>impossible as she had to fight laughing too.<p>"And the two of you will stay after school and clean up this chalk<br/>mess that is all over the room," Miss Ingawara finished as she opened<br/>up her lesson book and prepared to start class.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma leaned back in his chair during the short break between<br/>classes and looked up at the ceiling with a content smile, "That was<br/>really fun. I wonder why me and Akane never have fun like that?"<p>"Probably because she'd take it as just one of your ways to show you<br/>had superior skill and then take it as a serious challenge. She<br/>wouldn't have realized you were just playing," Cologne replied also<br/>smiling. "That girl has got to lighten up or she'll end up like<br/>Hibiki, hating others for her own faults."<p>"Hey! It's not all her fault! I tend to take challenges a bit too<br/>seriously, but she doesn't seem to understand that I also do Martial<br/>Arts for fun too," Ranma stated doing a rare thing and pointing out<br/>one of his own faults.<p>"You know the reason," Cologne gave Ranma a look and Ranma nodded<br/>slightly with a touch of sadness on his face. "I take it teaching her<br/>finally hasn't worked out?"<p>"She ain't got the control she needs for the chi training that Ryoga<br/>taught her! And the Soul of Ice training was a total bust. . . I'm<br/>not even going to try teaching her the full 'Hiryu Shoten Ha' as<br/>she'd just hurt herself. She needs to step back two stages and learn<br/>things right but she won't let herself see that she needs to learn<br/>the basics again," Ranma explained in frustration. "If she keeps this<br/>up she's gonna kill herself and take others with her!"<p>"Maybe I should look into training her in the Amazon Wu Shu? That<br/>way she could be forced to relearn the basics as she is learning a<br/>new style," Cologne offered with a small smile.<p>"Sounds like a plan," Ranma agreed as the next teacher came into the<br/>room and the class started again.<p>- - - -<p>"You guys are like. . . totally cool!" the short boy with glasses<br/>from the front of Ranma's row said as he came up to Ranma's desk<br/>during the longer class break.<p>"It was pretty impressive. . . are you two Martial Artists?" asked<br/>the brunet girl that sat in front of Ranma with a large smile. "I<br/>heard you talking about training before."<p>Jin and Yuri, right?" Cologne asked the two and received nods. "Both<br/>myself and Ranma are masters of our respective styles. . . so yes we<br/>are Martial Artists."<p>Ranma gave Cologne an odd look at that as technically she was the<br/>grandmaster of her style but decided not to make an issue about it.<p>"My brother, Hiroshi, is always talking about all the wild Martial<br/>stuff he sees at Furinkin," Yuri said with a small frown. "He's<br/>always talking about his friend Ranma."<p>"Is he?" Ranma replied a little impressed as Cologne started giggling.<p>"Yeah, he talks about how Ranma can leap buildings and can move so<br/>fast that you can't see it. I think it sounds too much like an anime<br/>character to be real," Yuri continued rolling her eyes at the<br/>thought. "Me, I just want to make the Martial Arts Rhythmic<br/>Gymnastics team this year."<p>"You know that style don't you Ranma?" Cologne asked and started<br/>giggling again as he glared at her.<p>"You know Martial Rhythmic Gymnastics? Isn't it a girl's sport?" Jin<br/>asked confused.<p>"It's a Martial style and learning it regardless of who it was<br/>designed for will only improve one's skill," Cologne replied sagely.<p>"So you know it too?" Yuri asked smiling as she started to think<br/>they might be able to a big help getting her on the team.<p>"Ah. . . no," cologne admitted looking a little embarrassed causing<br/>Ranma to laugh.<p>"Maybe if we both joined the team we could learn it together?" Yuri<br/>offered with another smile, but not as broadly this time.<p>"Well. . . I don't think. . ." Cologne started to try to back out of<br/>it but Ranma cut her off to tease her.<p>"Why not? You said it was worth knowing, and you don't know it,"<br/>Ranma smirked.<p>"Maybe we could bring 'Ranko' too, just to make the team even<br/>stronger? She is after all the only competitor to beat that Kuno girl<br/>last year," Cologne suggested evilly.<p>"You know the red-haired girl who beat Kodachi Kuno! She goes to<br/>this school!" Yuri was almost jumping up and down in her chair out<br/>of excitement.<p>"Technically she goes to this school, but you'll rarely see her,"<br/>Cologne replied giving Ranma a smirk. "Usually only on rainy days,<br/>she likes rain a lot."<p>"Ranko? Hiroshi talks about her too. . . she's supposed to be like<br/>Ranma's sister or something. . . Hiroshi was never really clear about<br/>that," Yuri looked confused, then it dawned on her. "Wait! Your name<br/>is Ranma Saotome too! Are you related to the Ranma that Hiroshi<br/>knows?"<p>"Sorta. . . Ranma is a very common name in the Saotome family as of<br/>late," Ranma sighed depressed. Cologne had to suppress a laugh as she<br/>thought about all the other Ranmas. The fake Ranma hunting Genma, the<br/>two mirror copies of Ranma who ran off to be with each other, and the<br/>child Ranma. . . well that one didn't really count as he was just the<br/>real Ranma, only even younger then Ranma was right now.<p>"Wow," Yuri beamed at the two then smiled at Cologne. "Are you a<br/>member of the Saotome family too?"<p>"No. . . not as of yet," Cologne replied and smirked at the wide-<br/>eyed look of shock at her. "I'm a Chinese Amazon, I'm sure your<br/>brother has mentioned them to you as well."<p>"Chinese Amazon. . . ah, um, yeah he has. . ." Yuri tried not<br/>looking at Cologne.<p>"I take it that none of what he said was good?" Cologne lifted an<br/>eyebrow at the girl.<p>"I think Hiroshi's only exposure to Amazons is Shampoo and Mousse,"<br/>Ranma gave Cologne a sad smile. "Not exactly a glowing example after<br/>all."<p>"You exposure to our people has been much more then that, does it<br/>leave you with a simular opinion?" Cologne asked almost looking hurt.<p>"Nah, I rarely hold a grudge with anyone, and I tend to not judge a<br/>group of people on a few examples," Ranma shrugged as he balanced his<br/>pencil on the tip of his finger by it's point.<p>"How very enlightened of you. If more people were like that this<br/>world would be in less problems," Cologne smirked as she was being a<br/>little sarcastic. Taking two pencils out she winked at him as she<br/>balanced them on her first two fingers on her primary hand.<p>Jin gave Yuri a small nudge and whispered to her with a smile, "I<br/>think they're at it again."<p>Yuri simply nodded back as Ranma balanced another pencil on the same<br/>hand then put his eraser on it's corner to balance on the first<br/>pencil.<p>By the time the next teacher came in the pair were balancing a<br/>pencil on each finger with something on top of each, small things<br/>like erasers to larger things like pencil cases. The teacher cleared<br/>his throat as Jin and Yuri were trying to place a pencil on each<br/>Martial Artist's nose causing them to drop the pencils and<br/>accidentally bump both Ranma and Cologne's other pencils to start<br/>them to fall. In a burst of speed all the falling articles were<br/>caught and given back to their owners before anything could hit the<br/>floor.<p>The teacher simply shook his head slightly as he started his lesson,<br/>it was Nerima after all and Martial Artists were to be expected.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma sat down on a long flat stone that was set under a large tree<br/>as he pulled out his bento. He had looked forward to Kasumi's lunch<br/>since breakfast, when he got hungry again, and now he could finally<br/>eat it.<p>"Enjoying that?" Cologne asked as she sat down with him pulling a<br/>larger bento out of her bag and offered it to Ranma. "Want another<br/>one?"<p>Ranma cracked open Kasumi's lunch as he eyed the offered bento from<br/>Cologne suspiciously.<p>"Don't worry it's not drugged," Cologne rolled her eyes at the boy.<br/>"Shampoo made a mistake trying to do that to you that time. I promise<br/>I won't try to add *special* ingredients to anything I give you, will<br/>that make you feel better?"<p>Ranma reluctantly took the still offered bento and looked slightly<br/>embarrassed about his doubt of Cologne, besides a few jokes about<br/>their relationship all Cologne had done so far was trying to be a<br/>friend and she didn't deserve that kind of suspicion from him. . .<br/>then again she made Nabiki look like an amateur in manipulation.<p>"Wow, they even sit together at lunch, they must be going out!" Jin<br/>joked as he walked up to the pair with Yuri at his side. Yuri frowned<br/>at Jin at the comment but had to admit that she might not have a<br/>chance at snagging Ranma as it seemed Cologne had already done it,<br/>and she wanted Cologne as a friend.<p>"We're not going out," Ranma replied from behind the bento he was<br/>finishing before starting in the larger one.<p>Yuri shook her head slightly trying not to giggle as Cologne rolled<br/>her eyes at Ranma's statement, after all boys were usually the last<br/>to know they had a girlfriend, "Jin lay off them, can't you see they<br/>want their relationship to be quiet."<p>"Then they shouldn't be so obvious about it," Jin countered as he<br/>sat on another stone that faced the pair.<p>"We're not going out," Ranma replied again sounding a little more<br/>annoyed as he continued to eat the great food Cologne had made. "I'm<br/>already engaged."<p>"WHAT!" Jin and Yuri exclaimed in shock as Cologne slapped her<br/>forehead then looked to the heavens quietly asking 'why?'.<p>Jin and Yuri were about to start into asking all sorts of questions<br/>about this when someone interrupted them.<p>"Ranma! There you are!" a small girl with short blue-black hair<br/>called out as she ran up to the group looking very very unhappy.<p>"What's wrong Akane?" Ranma stood looking concerned placing his<br/>bento down carefully as he scanned the area around Akane incase what<br/>ever was bothering her was following her. What he caught was several<br/>kids wearing the uniform cut that Akane's age group wore trying to<br/>stand nonchalant while keeping an eye on Akane as she came up to<br/>Ranma. The girl of the group looked very bruised and the stronger of<br/>the boys was sporting a nasty shiner.<p>"It's been a horrible day!" Akane complained in an angry huff as she<br/>stopped in front of Ranma and looked up into his eyes.<p>"What happened?" Ranma asked again slightly more coldly as he kept<br/>the group in his field of vision.<p>"Pervert boys!. . . and a pervert girl," Akane huffed again but<br/>realized that Ranma was watching something over her shoulder,<br/>lowering her voice she asked, "Are they back there?"<p>"Three boys, all of which look like they have been held back a year<br/>or two, and a blonde girl that looks like a punching bag?" Cologne<br/>asked as she described the group Ranma was watching. "That black eye<br/>on the biggest boy was an accident wasn't it?"<p>"He wasn't who I was trying to hit," Akane admitted with a frown.<br/>"But he had it coming! He and that bitch spanked me!"<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed at that as Jin, Yuri, and even Cologne's eyes<br/>widened at what Akane stated. Before anyone could say anything else<br/>Ranma disappeared and Cologne groaned as he was just playing knight<br/>in shining armour again.<p>The boy with the shiner knew something was wrong when he lost track<br/>of the older boy the little crybaby was talking to. He didn't have to<br/>wait long for what he expected to happen. The older boy seemed to<br/>simple appear in front of him and the area got a lot colder. Kentro<br/>crossed his arms unconcerned by the action as the rest of his friends<br/>jumped back in shock, "Was that supposed to be impressive?"<p>"Leave Akane Tendo alone," Ranma stated in a very cold and dangerous<br/>tone not caring that the boy didn't react, after what he and Cologne<br/>had seen in the boy he wasn't expecting any reaction anyways.<p>"And if I don't?" Kentro smirked as he gathered his energy expecting<br/>a fight.<p>"I've read your skill level and you might be a good fight but I've<br/>taken better down more then a few pegs," Ranma stood with out<br/>reacting to the boy's focussing.<p>"Big words, care to back those words up?" Kentro shot a foot at were<br/>Ranma was just standing obviously missing as Ranma was standing a<br/>foot to the right.<p>"Not bad, but way too slow kid," Ranma gave an amused smirk at the<br/>flare in the boy's eyes. Ranma continued to move to the right faster<br/>then Kentro could bring his attacks to bear on him and came to the<br/>center of what he planned. Now he would have gone easier on the boy<br/>except that what he saw as a skill close to his father's in a boy<br/>several years younger then himself, and that the boy was obviously<br/>honourless to pick on a smaller girl. "HIRYU SHOTEN HA!"<p>Kentro was caught by surprise as the tornado sprung to life around<br/>him and Ranma suddenly. Without being prepared for it he was swept up<br/>into the howling winds and bounced from one edge to another only to<br/>fall to the ground barely conscious when Ranma stopped the move.<br/>Trying to lift himself on one working arm he looked up at the cold<br/>eye's of the older boy who simple said, "Leave Akane Tendo alone."<p>Ranma walked back to the group without looking back, know full well<br/>the boy had fallen unconscious when he left. He was still disturbed<br/>that the boy had the kind of skill that made it necessary to pull out<br/>the big moves just to scare him. . . it was something to look into<br/>later.<p>"Ranma. . .?" Akane asked looking concerned between him and the<br/>group of bullies.<p>"If they bother you again come to me right away," Ranma replied with<br/>a small frown. "You can't deal with that one guy. . . not yet<br/>anyways, but you will be able to soon."<p>"I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY. . ." Akane started to scream in protest,<br/>forgetting she had come to Ranma for help in the first place, but she<br/>was cut off.<p>"You can deal with all of them but that last boy," Cologne said in<br/>all seriousness. "Ranma wouldn't have used such a deadly technique if<br/>he didn't have too and you know it. That boy has more skill then he<br/>should."<p>"Mind explaining that?" Ranma asked as he sat down and picked up the<br/>bento Cologne gave him again.<p>"He has the skills of a master. . . but he lacks the discipline<br/>required to learn those moves," Cologne looked slightly confused but<br/>continued. "He tried to hit you with moves his body isn't ready to<br/>use yet. . . simular to the position I'm in with such a young body. I<br/>can't do many of the moves I use to as I'm not conditioned in body<br/>enough anymore."<p>"Could he have found the 'mushrooms' too?" Akane asked as she sat<br/>next to Ranma. "Or some other way of becoming younger?"<p>"No, he's his right age," Ranma replied glancing at the group again.<br/>"He was fighting like he knew the moves but not how to really use<br/>them yet."<p>"Excuse us. . . but what are you guys talking about?" Jin butted in<br/>reminding the three that he and Yuri were still there. They had been<br/>stunned by what they had just seen as no one they had ever met could<br/>do anything like that. For Yuri it was proof to everything her older<br/>brother had been telling her over the last year.<p>Ranma rolled his eyes to the heavens and silently cursed himself for<br/>forgetting about the two, "Sorry, we're. . um, we really can't. . ."<p>"Yuri, when you get home ask your brother if the Ranma Saotome and<br/>Akane Tendo he knows were at Furinkin today," Cologne instructed<br/>calmly as both Ranma and Akane looked at her strange. "Tomorrow we'll<br/>explain if you promise not to tell anyone."<p>"Um, okay I guess," Yuri replied confused. Actually she sorta knew<br/>the Akane Tendo that Hiroshi went to class with as she once took her<br/>class on a tour as part of a extra curricular assignment. . . come to<br/>think about it this Akane Tendo looked like that one's younger<br/>sister, had to be a Cousin. Turning to look at the younger girl Yuri<br/>smiled, "So. . . are you Ranma's fiance?"<p>"It's our parents idea!" Akane and Ranma both exclaimed out of<br/>reflex and started laughing when they realized that they did it again.<p>"Actually the engagement has been postponed for a while so I'm not<br/>technically his fiancé right now," Akane explained to two very<br/>confused people.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma was still very annoyed about the lunch fight when the three of<br/>them were heading home after school. He had enjoyed the day up till<br/>then, he liked having a person to play with the Art with without the<br/>petty reactions he usually got. Cologne was a pure shock as she<br/>seemed so much more nicer at this age then when she was the 'old<br/>ghoul' and it made Ranma want to smile despite the problem that the<br/>other boy posed.<p>"You can't keep using moves like that on him. . . you might do him<br/>permanent harm," Cologne said from beside him shaking her head<br/>slightly. "He may have the skill but it isn't his somehow."<p>"Maybe it's some kind of possession?" Akane asked from Ranma's other<br/>side as she looked across to Cologne.<p>"Could be. . . but it doesn't feel right for that," Cologne nodded<br/>back showing Akane had a reasonable idea. "We'll have to look into<br/>that."<p>"This is taking too long!" Ranma said suddenly taking both girls by<br/>surprise. Taking Akane into his arms he jumped to the nearest raised<br/>wall then onto a roof. "I'm hungry!"<p>"Ranma!" Akane protested and struggled until she realized she was<br/>high above the ground then she closed her mouth and held on tightly,<br/>even though she knew Ranma would never drop her she felt very scared<br/>at the moment.<p>Cologne sighed then jumped after the boy with a smirk, "I suggest<br/>the Nekohanten as Kasumi is there and not at the Dojo."<p>"Oh yeah that's right, Thanks for reminding me!" Ranma called out as<br/>he quickly changed course.<p>After a few minutes Ranma came to a stop in front of the restaurant<br/>and put Akane down on her feet then was assaulted by Akane as she<br/>pounded on his chest repeatedly, "Idiot! Why couldn't you have warned<br/>me first!"<p>"Where's the fun in that?" Ranma asked Akane with his lopsided smile<br/>as Cologne hopped down beside them.<p>"Oh calm down Chil. . Akane-chan if was just for fun," Cologne<br/>rolled her eyes at the younger girl at her normal actions.<p>"Nah, Akane's not really mad at me, if she was I'd be malleted by<br/>now," Ranma replied back still smiling. "She's just frustrated that<br/>she could join in on her own."<p>"Well you've never tried to teach me how!" Akane stepped back,<br/>turned away, and crossed her arms in annoyance.<p>"Then you don't have to worry, we'll be covering that when I start<br/>training you," Cologne stated offhandedly trying not the smirk as she<br/>walked into the restaurant.<p>"Train me?" Akane asked in confusion as Ranma walked past her and<br/>entered the restaurant as well.<p>- - - -<p>Author's Notes: There is Chapter 4. I was trying to show that even<br/>though it's been his whole life that Ranma can have fun with the Art.<br/>Too much of the Manga and Anime shows him striving to get better to<br/>beat someone and not having a lot of fun with it. Akane is going to<br/>be a little off for awhile as she isn't comfortable being so young.<br/>What actually happened in Akane's class will be covered in the next<br/>chapter along with Nodoka's, Shampoo's, and Kasumi's day.<p>For the record there is someone helping to edit this. . . I just<br/>haven't heard back from him for the first three chapters. I'll update<br/>them when he does.<p>Hope you are enjoying this.<p>Felix
