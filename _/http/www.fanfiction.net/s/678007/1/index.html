</div>A Ranma 1 / 2 Alternate Histories Company Presents:<p>Cologne for Teens<p>By Felix Webster ( Felix Warstar )<br/>[felix_]<p>Disclaimer: All original Ranma 1/2 Characters and Back story<br/>Copyright Rumiko Takahashi. This is written for fun and not for any<br/>profit so please don't sue as I'm a poor writer who one day hopes to<br/>write something original and become a so called professional writer.<br/>. . this is just practice.<p>Chapter 1<p>- Magic Mushrooms. . .Again -<p>"Well, that was unexpected. . ." the young girl stated as she tried<br/>to readjust her short robes. The Blue robes barely covered all that<br/>was needed as it was never meant to be worn by someone as tall as the<br/>girl with the purple-blue hair was now.<p>"It worked?" Ranma asked as he stood with his back towards the girl<br/>trying to be a gentleman about this.<p>"Yes. . I would say it did," the girl replied as she looked down on<br/>her young body amazed. "And you say this is permanent?"<p>"According to Ryouga you have to either eat another mushroom at the<br/>right length or grow up again," Ranma said calmly even though he was<br/>nervous. "Can I turn around yet?"<p>"Of course, you didn't have to turn around in the first place,"<br/>Cologne chuckled softly. "I doubt you'll be calling me old ghoul any<br/>time soon."<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow at the younger girl standing across form him<br/>as if the robe fit properly, "Nah, I guess I have ta call you kid now."<p>"Oww," Ranma rubbed his head slightly as he grinned. "Haven't lose<br/>any skill though."<p>"Yes and no, I'll have to train this body to prepare it for the more<br/>advanced techniques I know but it's in good shape," Cologne said<br/>smiling but she also looked confused. "Why so young?"<p>"It's not that young, only thirteen centimeters long," Ranma<br/>replied. "Nabiki felt that if we made ya any older you'd might try ta<br/>marry me like Shampoo is."<p>"The Tendo girl has made a small mistake then," Cologne's smile got<br/>larger. "I'm old enough to do the 'Kiss of Marriage' regardless of<br/>being in a thirteen year old body."<p>"Well then I ain't going to fight you then," Ranma stated smugly.<p>"But Child, you have beat me several times already," Cologne replied<br/>trying not to laugh at the boy's face dropping and his sudden need to<br/>reassure himself of where the door was.<p>"Ya ain't serious!" Ranma exclaimed as he started to inch back<br/>towards the door.<br/>"Calm yourself Ranma. I'm not going to push that issue right now,"<br/>Cologne said seriously. "I'm a little surprised you offered this to<br/>me though."<p>"You remember the conditions," Ranma narrowed his eyes slightly.<p>"Yes yes, I remember," Cologne replied almost in annoyance. "Making<br/>a deal with that Tendo girl is like making a deal with. . ."<p>"You are ta release Shampoo from the 'Kiss of Marriage' and both<br/>'Kisses of Death' and ta stop attackin' Akane," Ranma reminded the<br/>girl cutting her off.<p>"I'll inform Shampoo of it when she gets back. I surprised that you<br/>didn't demand that we go back to China too," Cologne walked over to a<br/>restaurant mirror to truly look over her body.<p>"You going back ta China was a given, but I wouldn't push a decision<br/>on ya like that," Ranma looked away as Cologne lifted up the robe to<br/>check her new chest out.<p>Cologne chuckled to herself as she watched Ranma in the reflection,<br/>for a part-time girl he was oftly shy of other girl's bodies even if<br/>he wasn't about his own, "Very kind of you, but you know that just<br/>because I tell Shampoo that the 'Kiss' is nullified does not mean she<br/>will stop."<p>"Yeah, I know. How'd Nabiki put it? Shampoo will have ta do it the<br/>regular way now," Ranma said as he thought hard on the former<br/>conversation. "It's part of the contract."<p>"Yes it was. Shampoo will have to try to get you to date her like<br/>any other girl," Cologne agreed as she tried straightening the robe<br/>again. "To that end she will probably have to go to the school as a<br/>student now."<p>"Oh great," Ranma cringed.<p>"If you will excuse me Ranma, I have to see about getting proper<br/>clothes," Cologne turned towards him and gave him an evil smirk as<br/>she lifted up the front of the robe showing him how short it was again.<p>"Yeah, great," Ranma replied almost in a panic as he quickly left<br/>the restaurant.<p>Cologne chuckled to herself as she removed the robe completely and<br/>walked up the stairs to raid her Great-Granddaughter's closet until<br/>she could get her own, "I always said that if I was three hundred<br/>years younger. . ."<p>- - - -<p>"Soooo, how'd it go Ranma?" Nabiki asked as soon as Ranma ran into<br/>the house. She smirked at the panicked look that Ranma currently held<br/>on his face.<p>"Shampoo is of the hook for those 'Kisses'," Ranma replied quickly<br/>but didn't seem happy. "But we might have a new problem. . ."<p>"We?" Nabiki leaned against the wall crossing her arms looking<br/>unimpressed with the boy.<p>"You were wrong about the age thing. It don't matter what age she<br/>looks ta Amazon law just how old she really is," Ranma explained as<br/>he caught his breath after realizing no one had followed him.<br/>"So. . . Cologne gave you the Kiss of Marriage?" Nabiki asked wide<br/>eyed in disbelief. This could really complicate her current plans and<br/>she went through too much to find those damn mushrooms again.<p>"No, not at this time, but she reminded me that I've beaten her a<br/>couple of times and she could if she wanted to," Ranma didn't cringe<br/>at that like Nabiki expected him to.<p>"And they aren't leaving are they?" Nabiki asked although she<br/>expected that they wouldn't, it was a hope but she hadn't put much<br/>faith into it.<p>"No," Ranma replied with a slight frown.<p>"Who's not leaving?" Akane asked as she came in from the back yard.<p>"It's not important Sis," Nabiki waved off Akane as she turned and<br/>headed for her room.<p>"Ranma, did Nabiki rope you into another one of her schemes? How<br/>much do you owe her this time?" Akane asked as her anger started to<br/>rise because she was basically being ignored.<p>"I don't owe her anything, she owes the Saotome family and she's<br/>trying ta repay that debt," Ranma said coldly as he turned to walk up<br/>to his room to get his work clothes. "I've got ta go help with the<br/>Dojo tonight."<p>Akane watched stunned by Ranma's coldness to her then looked at the<br/>destroyed Dojo and both Fathers working on rebuilding it. It had just<br/>been repaired from the wedding fiasco and then she made the mistake<br/>of asking Ryouga to teach her how to do the chi ball attack. She<br/>found her focus but it wasn't a good thing, it was anger and it was<br/>uncontrollable. If Ranma hadn't been nearby she would have died when<br/>the roof collapsed from the walls being blown out. He had done the<br/>one thing he had never done before to her that day, he slapped her.<br/>The slap was to knock some sense into her for being stupid enough to<br/>try to develop a chi blast inside. She should have known better after<br/>seeing so many of them but she didn't believe she had enough chi to<br/>make more then a small ball more harmless then anything else. . she<br/>unfortunately tapped into her anger and frustration because it was<br/>taking so long to learn.<p>Akane was shook out of her thoughts about the past by a shout from<br/>up stairs.<p>"NABIKI!"<p>"Ranma?" Akane bolted up the stairs as fast as she could and nearly<br/>dropped at the sight in front of her. Ranma stood in the hall wearing<br/>only his favorite red Chinese shirt, the pants to the set had fallen<br/>off because they didn't fit anymore, glaring at her older sister<br/>holding out an empty bowl of rice. Nabiki was looking as shocked as<br/>Akane was at seeing a yet again younger Ranma.<p>"Why Nabiki? Why'd ya do it ta me?" Ranma asked looking panicked and<br/>betrayed at the same time.<p>"I. . I didn't," Nabiki replied wide eyed at the younger boy. "I<br/>only got four mushrooms, I gave one to a friend to research, and the<br/>other two were locked away!"<p>"Then how did this happen!" Ranma pointed out to younger body.<br/>Although it wasn't too much younger then he was normally it was<br/>enough to cause problems.<br/>"How DID it happen?" Akane asked confused. "And what's with the<br/>mushrooms being back again? Did Ryouga find some more?"<p>"I was hungry and there was a bowl of rice with a mushroom and<br/>several pickled carrots on it in my room. . I thought it was Pop's,"<br/>Ranma said feeling a little stupid.<p>"Why are there mushrooms here again!" Akane asked again getting<br/>angry at being ignored, a small glow started around she clenched her<br/>fists.<p>"AKANE! SOUL OF ICE! NOW!" Ranma yelled at her glaring sternly,<br/>Akane stepped back in shock and the glow went away immediately.<p>"Sorry. . ." Akane replied shame faced as she calmed down. Akane<br/>hadn't even come close to learning the technique that Ranma decided<br/>to teach her after she developed her chi ball but being told to use<br/>it meant she was getting dangerously close to losing it and possibly<br/>hurting someone.<p>"I'll check on the ones I have here and I'll call my friend about<br/>hers," Nabiki offered as she ducked back into her room for a moment,<br/>she came back out pale. "My safe has been rifled through and the<br/>mushrooms are gone!"<p>"But who would want to do that?" Akane asked as she followed Nabiki<br/>and Ranma downstairs to the phone.<p>"Someone that wanted either me, Pop, or my Mother thirteen years<br/>old," Ranma replied as Nabiki dialed her friend.<p>After a moment of Nabiki talking to the person doing research she<br/>turned to the other two, "The one I gave to her has been stolen too."<p>"So we either have to find the ones stolen or get some more," Akane<br/>said as if it wasn't a problem.<p>"I took the only ones that were there and the man that lived near<br/>them said no more would grow for about a year," Nabiki looked very<br/>unhappy then a little scared. "And the person who stole them has two<br/>more. . and is willing to use them."<p>"Only person I can think of is Happosai," Ranma said in an angry<br/>tone. "He'd love ta see my Mother as a teenager again."<p>"Or have a few more years with you stuck living here before being<br/>able to go off to College," Nabiki added.<p>"Nah, he'd hate ta lose the chest I have as a girl and I should be<br/>smaller now I'm younger," Ranma replied in disgust. "It has to be my<br/>Mother that was the target."<p>"So we have to stop him from getting your Mother to eat one of those<br/>two mushrooms," Nabiki stated then turned back to her room. "I've got<br/>to make an inventory of what else he took and then I'll meet you two<br/>downstairs to start looking for him."<p>"I'll go warn Mother," Ranma agreed as he hopped over the stairs<br/>railing.<p>"I. . I guess I should warn Dad and Kasumi," Akane said to the empty<br/>hallway as she started down the stairs.<p>"Oh Sweeto! Akane my dear how fortunate I've run into you!" a<br/>scratchy voice exclaimed from behind her as she walked into the<br/>living room. Turning to give the little pervert a piece of her mind<br/>she almost gagged on the mushroom going into her mouth before<br/>swallowing it. Happosai didn't bother sticking around to see the<br/>change as he could hear others coming, "See ya Akane!"<p>Akane tried to support herself as she tried to get her breathing<br/>back to normal when Ranma caught her as she misjudged the distance to<br/>the door frame.<p>"Careful Akane, Ya gotta take a moment to readjust to the size<br/>difference," Ranma said calmly as he helped the now younger girl to<br/>the couch, he was an old pro at this after all.<p>"Why? Why'd he chose me to do this to?" Akane asked in disbelief<br/>shock as she sat down.<p>"Don't know, have ta ask him after I beat his little head in. . if<br/>he can still talk," Ranma said in anger as he glared out the patio<br/>door.<p>"Ranma! Akane! What happened!" Nabiki asked as she came down the<br/>stairs quickly.<p>"He got Akane with one of the other mushrooms," Ranma said still<br/>angry.<p>"I. . I can see that," Nabiki replied as she took in Akane's new<br/>look. . or she should say an old look come back. "Akane. . you look<br/>about. . I would guess twelve."<p>"WHAT! I thought the mushroom where grown for thirteen!" Akane<br/>jumped up in panic and tried to get a look at herself.<p>"Um. . we weren't sure what age we were gonna offer to Cologne,"<br/>Ranma said nervously. "Two were thirteen centimeters, one was eleven<br/>centimeters, and one was sixteen centimeters. . just incase something<br/>like this happened"<p>"I gave the sixteen one to my friend to see if she could grow it,<br/>fungus tends to be able to do that," Nabiki added as she watched<br/>Akane suddenly click in one the list.<p>"I'M ELEVEN AGAIN!" Akane screamed then sat down on the verge of<br/>crying. "Why? Why. . ?"<p>"If we get the other one back you can have it. You'll be sixteen<br/>again and not a kid," Ranma said as he sat quietly.<p>"But what about you? You need it too!" Akane spun on Ranma.<p>"I can wait the year for the next mushrooms to grow. . you shouldn't<br/>have to," Ranma replied softly not looking at Akane.<p>"It's a moot point until we get that mushroom back," Nabiki stated<br/>quickly as she saw a look of defiance in her sister's eyes.<p>"I'm afraid that that isn't going to happen," a young woman's voice<br/>said from the entrance area.<p>"M. Mom?" Ranma bolted upright staring at the older teen girl with<br/>the auburn hair wearing a kimono.<br/>"Yes Ranma, I had a small encounter with the old Master on the way<br/>back from shopping," Nodoka replied as she walked into the room. "I<br/>see I wasn't the only victim of his actions."<p>- - - -<p>Author's Notes: Just a weird idea that a friend suggested the other<br/>night. I needed to write something fresh to get my juices flowing for<br/>RTVS chapter 10 and Robin 1 / 2 chapter 4 (chapter 3 is with a pre<br/>reader at the time of this piece.<p>The concept was Cologne becoming younger and a R+C fic. I didn't<br/>want there not to be conflict with this so Akane is younger and still<br/>holds a claim to Ranma but this is not for KotF out there. And of<br/>course a subplot is how does Genma and Nodoka deal with her becoming<br/>younger (only old enough to be thirteen year old Ranma's older sister<br/>and not his Mother).<p>This will only get worked on occasionally as other stories are more<br/>important at the moment.<p>+ If you haven't noticed I'm not so good at titles. . .
