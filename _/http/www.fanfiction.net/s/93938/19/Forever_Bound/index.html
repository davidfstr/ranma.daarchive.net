</div>Forever Bound<br/>Chapter 18, The Father, The Mohter, and The Child<p>Author's Notes: Okay, big battle scene in this one. It will pretty much try and wrap up my story, but there will probably be about 2 or 3 chapters left, plus an epliogue(I just feel if you got a prologe, you have to have an epilogue too). Oh and to Siobhan who wants to know who Shou Yung is, go back and read chapter 10. And about my pre-reader...it's not that my pre-reader is bad at proof reading, it's just that I currently...um...don't have a pre-reader *blushes*. I need a couple people to proof-read for me. I can't pay you, but at least you get to read the story before everyone else. Oh yeah, from now on, each chapter of all my stories are gonna end with a song. I'm gonna go back and find some chapters to add songs to. I'll start with Scarlet Phoenix, Blue Dragon Chapters for the songs. Send all comments and criticism to silverflame_.<p>Disclaimers: Rumiko Takahashi owns Ranma 1/2. Oh! My Goddess belongs to whoever they belong to. Not me.<p>Akane slowly gained counciousness and found at her upmost annoyance, that she was tied to a chair. She opened her eyes fully and looked around to see herself in Kasumi's room. Suddenly, she remembered what happened before she left the councious world and she felt panic rise in her. Akane felt her breath quicken and she started to hypervenilate, she started to twist and pull on the tight ropes binding her hands. Obviously, whoever tied it knew how strong she was. *Ranko has Bell...Ranko has Bell...who's Ranko? She's...she's...who is she? Ranma's girl form was named Ranko...no, it's not Ranma-chan...it's...it's...the fire girl in my dream! The one that looks like...Grenada? Who is that?...* At that Akane gave a grumble from her frustration.<p>Kasumi entered the room holding a warm white towel and said sweetly, "Hello, Akane. You really shouldn't twist and pull on those ropes, it will harm your skin and create bruises. Now sit still do I can wash your face."<br/>Akane started to breathe harder as she felt the room darken again. She closed her eyes, took one large breath and opened them again before she said extra sweetly trying desperatly not to scream, "Kasumi, oneechan, can you please untie me?"<p>Kasumi just kneeled down and wiped Akane's face as she said sweetly, "Oh, I can't do that, Akane dear."<br/>"And why not?" Akane gritted out.<br/>"Because Ranma, father, and Tofu told me not to," Kasumi said obliviously. *Okay, if she listened to them and it's not her idea, maybe I can trick her. Sorry oneechan...*<br/>Akane thought.<br/>"Kasumi, oneechan dearest, you know your my favorite sister, right? I would never want you to disobey daddy and everyone, but I just want to get out so that I can go buy the soy sauce. Did you know we are out of soy sauce, Kasumi?" Akane asked sweetly.<p>"But, oh Akane dearest, I do know I am you favorite sister. I am not disobeying daddy, Akane, I want you tied here so you can't cause trouble. Oh yeah, one more thing, Akane, I'm sweet, not stupid," Kasumi said calmly and sweetly in a motherly tone not once even blinking. She could have been discussing the weather. *Okay so maybe, oneechan, isn't so easy to manipulate...* Akane would have felt guilty for thinking so low of her sister...if it was a different situation.<br/>"Dammit, Kasumi, LET ME GO!" Akane yelled for the first time at the closest thing to a mother as she grew up. Kasumi seemed unfazed, but before she could say anything, Akane heard someone at the door.<p>"Sorry, no can do, Akane," Ranma said coldly, his face behind the shadows. Akane shivered involuntarily at the coldness illuminating from him and reaching her. Kasumi got up, gave Akane a warm smile as if she just didn't yell at her and left. Ranma stepped from the shadows and Akane saw such fury in him she actually would have felt fear...if she wasn't so angry herself.<p>"LET ME GO, Ranma!" she screamed.<br/>"Can't. This for your own good," Ranma said cooly, though his fury was expertly controlled under a mask of calm.<br/>"She's my daughter, Ranma! I have to save her!" Akane tried to reason.<br/>"No, you don't have to do, anything. I'll save her."<br/>"What gives you the right to-"<br/>"Frankly, Akane, I don't think your in a position to argue with me," Ranma pointed out. Akane gave a growl of frustration and started banging loudly on the chair.<p>"Now, I would love to stay and chat with you, Akane, but I have a blond beauty to save. Don't get jealous, now." *He's joking at a time like this! Why, that insolent, pathetic, lazy jerk!* Akane thought, but soon she decided to share her opinions with Ranma.<br/>Ranma left the room, locking it as he left. Behind him, he could still hear the string of curses Akane shot at him and the things in which she referred him to. He wasn't upset at her, in fact that was what he was trying to do. As long as she was angry, she won't have time to start thinking and fear what Ranko will do to Belldandy. She, also won't have time to think on what *he* will do to Ranko.<p>Akane heard Ranma's footsteps ceased down the hall as she quieted. Akane used all her strength and pushed backwards staright into Kasumi's dresser. A picture frame fell onto the floor and shattered ans Akane moved her feet so that she pulled a large piece near her foot. She, then proceeded to use her feet to take off her right shoe and sock. Akane used her toes to pick up the glass. She flinched at the pain and she saw the blood, but that did not matter. She bent her knee so that it placed the glass in her lap. Akane bent her head down and picked up the glass in her mouth. The next part was going to be difficult, but she managed to let the glass slide down her right arm and caught it before it fell...right into her hands.<p>Akane started to cut at the rope, her face moist with concentration and perspiration until she manged to free both her arms and legs. Before Akane jumped out the 2-story window, however, she said, "I'm tough, Ranma, not stupid."<p>Ranma stood in front of the Yarshi cave, according to the villagers at the bottom of the mountain. He swallowed his fury once more and tried not let the sweet thought of choking Ranko thrill him. As he entered the dark cave, Ranma placed out his hand and a blue fire appeared in mid-air on top of it. Strangely, the small fire lit the whole room and Ranma saw that the cave continued on long. He gave a steady sigh and thought *Calm, keep the calm*<p>After walking on what seemed an eternity Ranma leaned back agaisnt a wall and sat down, putting his head into his hands. Suddenly, the pig-tailed boy's acute senses heard silent footsteps behind him. Ranma leaped and stretched himself across the ceiling of the cave. He saw a figure approach and jumped down to catch the person by the arm only to see a pair of chaclate brown eyes staring angrily at him. Anger and fear filled him at once.<p>"Akane, you idiot, what are you doing here?" he whispereed angrily.<br/>"Saving my daughter," Akane heatedly retorted.<br/>Ranma started to pull at Akane's arm, "Come on, your going home." Before Akane could pull her hand away or protest, they both heard a voice, "Tell her she can't leave, Ranma darling. I warned her not to come, she did anyways. You don't have to feel guilty for her mistake." Neither of them said a word, but the air seemed to practically scream one word, "Ranko."<p>They both followed the voice to a large lit room with chrystal walls. Ranko stood there smiling confidently. Akane started to glow a deep red and started to run towards Ranko until she saw the red-haired girl tighten her hand around Belldandy's neck. Akane backed down beside Ranma, no longer glowering, now that all the blood had drained from her face. The room began to spin for her and she felt a nausenous in her stomach, but Akane refused to faint.<p>Ranma fixed his gaze on Ranko and said coldly as the walls near him began to ice over, "Let her go, now, Ranko, if you still want to leave here one piece."<br/>"Why should I let this little bastard go?" Ranko started to pull back on Belldandy's hair eliciting a cry from the already tear faced child. At that moment, Akane's dizziness was gone and she saw only red and one target and motive. She rushed towards Ranko aimlessly, but the other girl just extended her free hand and fire ropes shot from her hand, sticking Akane's arms, legs, and waist to the wall. Akane struggled, but she was held tight there.<p>Ranko turned towards Ranma and said disgustedly, "See, her? How could you even look at that slut without being disgusted at how pathtic she is Ranma?"<br/>Ranma gave Ranko a scathing look, "The only person I am disgusted with is you, Ranko." Ranma's reply was so calm, Ranko started to panic. In the time she spent with the martial artist she knew when he was most dangerous...when he appeared harmless, and spoke only in coldness. She had to get a rise out of him and fast.<p>"So, Ranma, how does it feel having your love deny you your own daughter?" she sneered. Ranma appeared confused, "What are you talking about?" *Ah, so he doesn't know...*<br/>"Why, Ranma, I'm surprised Akane didn't tell you Belldandy here was your daughter?" Ranko acted shockeed. Ranma's face ashened as he remembered who Belldandy remindeed him of, she reminded him of...Larchlarn...of his past self. Suddenly, Ranma knew exactly what Mu Tsu must have felt like. He turned his gaze toward Akane, hoping she would...deny it? Confirm it? Right now, the shock was still too much for him. Akane wasn't looking at him, however, but at the lady holding her daughter at death's point a, her eyes pleading her.<p>"You lie!" Ranma yelled at Ranko.<br/>"Sorry, my dear Ranma, but I don't. She is yours, no denying it. Guess your little Akane wasn't so truthful, after all," Ranko said.<p>Belldandy looked blearily through hot-stinging tears at Ranma and then towards her mother. "Mommy," she whispered, but nobody heard her, but she knew Akane did, she knew Akane heard. Then the mean red lady holding her delicate neck painfully said something and Belldandy found herself disbelieving. *Uncle Ranma is my dad?*<p>Bell-chan, Bell-chan<br/>*Oneechan?* Belldandy asked in her head.<br/>Yes, Bell-chan<br/>*Oneechan, save me, please!* the little girl begged.<br/>I am sorry, Bell-chan. They have already punished me for going back without permission. I can't return now the voice said regretfully.<br/>*Are you going to let Mommy die, oneechan*<br/>I can't come, Bell-chan, it's not possible, but you can save Mommy...and your newly discovered daddy Urd said.<br/>*How?* Belldandy wondered.<br/>In the words of Luke Skywalker, Let the force be with you Urd tried to joke.<br/>*Luke Skywalker didn't say that, oneechan, the other guy did. Now, stop playing around. This is serious, how am I going to save them* Belldandy said.<br/>Just trust yourself. Your innocent, not stupid and with that Urd's voice was gone.<p>Belldandy turned her attention back to the present world and saw that Ranko was screaming hysterically now and her grip on Belldandy's neck was tighter. Belldandy took one look at Akane on the wall, then Ranma standing rigid in the same place, afraid if he moveed to hurt Ranko, she would kill Belldandy.<p>Belldandy looked back inside her and she remembered something distant...<br/>######Memory#######<br/>It was just energy. Hot, blazing energy, a star, even that was there. It had no place to go, no thoughts, just that it was. And what it was was a star. Only energy. It was a new energy, the others with it were gone, to wherever. It wasn't lost, it just traveled. The energy star. Bright, blazing, violet. Suddenly, someone reached out and grabbed it. It wasn't a hand that grabbed it, it was just there...a stronger energy. The star fought and fought, but stopped after the stronger energy soothed it with something beyond description. The stronger energy stopped when the star was in rest and somehow the star understood what the stronger energy said though the words were not there. *Sleep, well, little star, no more travels for you anymore. You are very lucky to be the one chosen for them. Do not worry, they will protect and love you* And with that the star knew nothing more but that it was pushed towards a blinding light...<br/>######End Of Memory######<p>Belldandy looked back at Akane and Ranma,*...they will protect and love you...*<br/>She smiled softly, and she started to glow a goldish violet, strangely similar to the star. Akane's and Ranma's blue and red energy spiraled towards her and she burned so hot, Ranko let her go. Belldandy turned her small form towards Ranko, outstretched her tiny hand and blasted Ranko square across the chest.<p>A blind man could know that Ranko was injured, severly.<br/>Belldandy turned towards Ranma and she said shyly, "Hi, Daddy."<br/>Ranma grinned weakly, "You're not going to say "'Now you die"' like Keichii, are you?"<p>Belldandy ran into Ranma's arms needing the comfort she always wanted in a father. Ranma hugged her back and they turned towards a stumbling Akane trying to get up off of the floor. She looked up to see Belldandy run and hugged her. Akane picked her daughter up and gave her a large tightening hug. She finally saw Belldandy look elsewhere and looked there to see Ranma give her a huge smile.<br/>"Boy, Akane, guess you forgot to mention I had a daughter?" Ranma asked dryly.<br/>So, like the first time that Ranma met Belldandy, Akane slumped over and left the councious world.<p>Author's Notes: Check out the other chapters, cuz I added songs to some of them.<p>
