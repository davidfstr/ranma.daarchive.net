</div>Forever Bound<br/>Chapter 20, Farewell To Our Yesterdays<p>Author's Notes: Okay, okay the title is a little cliché, so sue me. No! Wait! Don't sue me, I meant it metaphorically (did I spell that right?). Anyways, this is the last chapter, *wahhhhhhh* It was wonderful, really. Oh yeah, you have to read the epilogue too, okay? Thank you, Thank you. Send all comments and criticism to silverflame_.<p>Disclaimers: Rumiko Takahashi owns Ranma 1/2 and Ah!My Goddess belongs to whoever they belong to, not me.<p>"Mommy?" Belldandy asked fearfully at Akane.<br/>Akane looked nervous and hugged Belldandy closer to her as she said to everyone around the room, "Um, I guess I should have mentioned that I'm...um...Marshidi."<br/>"Yes, you should have," Nabiki stated dryly.<br/>"So, let me get this straight, in a past life, Ranma was a Water God and Akane was a desert blossom sprite. They got married and gave birth to a goddess, Urd, right? Now, Belldandy is a goddess of the present?" Ukyo asked.<p>"Yes," was all Oappa said and all that she needed to say.<br/>It took Tifa to ask the question everyone feared, "So what now?"<br/>A voice spoke then and everyone turned to see Urd in her full form standing in the doorway, "What happens now is Belldandy goes with me to the god plane and takes on her position as a goddess."<br/>Akane's eyes teared up for she knew it was meant to be this way yet she could not help asking, "Why?"<p>Urd seemed regretful but she said, "I'm sorry, mom, but I can not changeit. If I don't take Belldandy up to the God plane now, she will disappear in an hour."<br/>Ranma finally spoke, "Will she come back?"<br/>Urd saw the hopeful spark in his eyes and everyone else's' so it pained her to say, "No, she must grant wishes as her duty until she becomes a goddess 1st class and only then can she return to the mortal realm at her own discretion. Yet, by the time that that happens, I believe none of you will still be alive."<p>"Oneechan, I don't want to go, please don't make me go," Belldandy cried, but Urd just smiled grimly. Belldandy searched her sister's eyes for any indication that her words were lies, but found none.<br/>Belldandy hugged Akane around the neck and kissed her on the cheek as she<br/>whispered, "Good-bye, Mommy, I will come back, I promise." She, then let go of Akane and ran to hug Ranma as she said, "Bye-bye d-daddy." As Belldandy ran to hug everyone and say her good-byes Akane cried in Ranma's shoulder.<p>When Belldandy reached Keichii, she gave him a large glomp that could have<br/>provided great competition to his mother's old one. When she moved to let him go, he held on tight and whispered in her hair as he cried, "Don't go, Bell-chan, p-please. I won't be mean to you no more, I promise. I won't call you tomboy, or uncute, or-"<br/>Belldandy silenced him with her tiny hand over his mouth, a sad look in her eyes as if she understood a pain a child should never experience.<br/>"Don't, Keichii-chan. Just say that you'll miss me and will never forget<br/>me, ever," she whispered.<p>"I won't ever forget you, Bell-chan, not ever," the little boy promised.<br/>Belldandy smiled, "Suki da, Keichii-chan." Keichii looked at her wonderingly, for he did not understand.<br/>"I l-like you to, Bell-chan," he said innocently as Belldandy laughed and said, "You don't understand yet, Keichii-chan...I shouldn't either, but I do...and you will. One day. Bye, Keichii-chan." Keichii gave her one last hug before releasing her reluctantly with a pained expression on his face. The men in the room looked at Keichii's face and they understood his<br/>pain, from Ranma to Dr. Tofu even, each losing a true love before. From the lost of love because of honor...<p>#####Ranma's flashback##########<br/>The small ship left the shore of Japan as Ranma leaned over the railing as far as he could without falling over. He was going to China. China, that word held no meaning to him, nothing special or unique. Not home...not Japan. China. New country, new home, new family, new friends, new life...old love. He felt guilty, he shouldn't be living on the past, he<br/>should just cut the strings that tied him to Japan and he has,...all except one. *Dammit!* he cursed silently. He shouldn't be like this, it shouldn't hurt this much, too many shouldn'ts'. Ranma knew Shampoo was in the cabin downstairs, probably celebrating her Amazon victory and at that moment he hated her with a vengence. At least the hate was better then the pain. At that moment anything was better then the pain in his heart, the loneliness in his soul, the hopeless depression. With a quick turn, Ranma marched off of the top deck of the ship. *Good-bye Japan, good-bye Nerima, good-bye Tendo dojo, good-bye everyone...good-bye Akane...*<br/>#####End of Flashback###########<br/>To the lost of love because of self-deception...<p>#####Kuno's flashback###########<br/>Kuno stood in front of the schoolyard searching for a certain shorthaired beauty. Today was his graduation and he couldn't be more proud of himself. Now, all he needed was her approval, sure she always treated him indifferently before, but she had to accept him now. She probably denied him in the past only because she lived in the same house with the evil Saotome, but he was gone now, she must love him now. For once, the Blue Thunder of<br/>Furinken High actually doubted himself. A cold fear ran through him when he didn't see her, he had to tell her today, he just HAD to. After all, he spent all those nights and days building up the courage for just this moment. Suddenly, Kuno saw her there with her family, a sad expression on her beautiful face. He felt the fear drift away and courage flow through his veins at the sight of her.<p>Kuno had knew, just KNEW, a few weeks before that he loved her. The other<br/>girl never stood a chance and he knew this when the other girl left. He knew he was just infatuated with the other girl's beauty, but she never really stood a chance. Kuno approached his loved one and smiled confidently.<p>"Hello, Kuno," she said sadly and Kuno felt his heart drop, he knew<br/>something was wrong.<br/>"What is wrong, my fair Queen?" he asked as he kissed her hand.<br/>She took her hand away, "Kuno, stop it! I have to tell you something. I'm not going to be here this summer, or the next. I am leaving in 2 days for Europe. I was accepted to a very good school there and I received an intern job there that pays well and will offer me great opportunities."<br/>"You are leaving me?" he asked in a strained voice. For once, the girl said two words that she actually meant, "I'm sorry." Kuno looked into her beautiful eyes and felt for the first time, true disappointment and loneliness. Her name ran through his mind and it's magical sound soothed his pain...Nabiki...<br/>######End of Flashback######<br/>To lost love because of no self-control...<p>#####Dr. Tofu's flashback###########<br/>Dr. Tofu looked up from his work as Ranma entered his clinic(flew into it was more like it). He gave a sigh at the bruised Ranma-chan and asked, "What happened this time, Ranma?"<br/>Ranma-chan gave an annoyed scowl, "How am I supposed to know why tomboys do the things they do?"<br/>Dr. Tofu sighed and started to bandage Ranma-chan's petite face. Ranma-chan peered at  from her long lashes and asked curiously, "What's the matter, Tofu-sensei? You're not your usual optimistic self."<p>Dr. Tofu gave a sigh and walked to his desk to pull out an envelope that he gave to Ranma.<br/>"Here, give this to Kasumi, it will explain everything," he told Ranma. Ranma-chan nodded and left the clinic, not noticing the small suitcase behind 's desk. What Kasumi read was, in shaky handwriting:<p>Dear Kasumi,<br/>I am sorry for my past behavior towards you. It is just that I love you. I know I cannot control myself around you so I am going to Canada to accept a special therapy they have there for situations such as mines'. I know I can not expect you to wait for me...but can you at least try...for Betty-chan?<br/>Your doctor,<br/>Ono Tofu<br/>######End of Flashback#######<br/>The lost of love because of jealousy...<p>######Shiro's flashback########<br/>Shiro laughed as he entered the Ucchan with Ukyo. It was empty as Ukyo turned on the lights and said, "I'll be back in a sec with the pictures. Don't steal anything!" With that she ran up the back stairs of the restaurant.<br/>"Oh I don't know, there's nothing valuable to steal here, anyways!" Shiro yelled jokingly back.<p>When Ukyo returned, she had in her hands a bunch of boxes and photo albums.<br/>She laid them on the table in front of Shiro. He picked up an album and a photo accidentally fell out. Before Ukyo could realize what photo it was and pick it up, Shiro had already snatched it. Shiro studied the picture. It was one of Ukyo smiling blissfully as she held onto the arm of a muscled guy with a pigtail. He turned the photo over and in Ukyo's handwriting were the words: "Ran-chan and Ucchan 2gether, 4ever" in a heart.<p>"What's this?" Shiro asked suspiciously as he held the photo before Ukyo.<br/>Ukyo started exclaiming, "I-I don't know how it got there, I thought I threw all his photos out. I swear it, Shi-chan!"<br/>"And exactly who is this 'Ran-chan'? Huh, Ucchan?" Shiro accused harshly.<br/>Ukyo started getting angry, "He was a friend of mine."<br/>"Oh really, and I guess you sleep with all your friends Ucchan?" Shiro yelled, not really thinking of what he was saying.<p>"What? What in the world are you saying? I never slept with Ran-chan! What do you take me for, Shiro? Sure, I admit it, I was infatuated with Ranma for some time, but that was all it was!" Ukyo yelled back, tears stinging in her eyes.<br/>"Ranma? Isn't that Akane's fiancée, Ukyo? What, you couldn't get someone for yourself, so you had to get your best friend's fiancé? From what I heard, he left her, right? Did he get tired of you and leave you too, Ukyo?" He didn't realize what he said until it was too late. Ukyo stared at him, incredulous, as tears ran down her cheeks. She ran and gave him a mighty shove out of the Ucchan, locking it behind him.<br/>#######End of flashback#######<br/>Lost love because of denial...<p>######Ryoga's flashback########<br/>P-chan looked up at Akane's face as she laid in her bed. "Ranma is such a jerk, P-chan..." *She doesn't love him, she says he's a jerk...*<br/>"Why can't he ever be nice to me...?" *She doesn't love him, he is too mean to her...*<br/>"For once, I just wish he wouldn't let those girls hang all over him..." *She doesn't love him, she's not jealous, she's just annoyed...*<br/>"I wish he would just say he...never mind...night P-chan." *She doesn't love him, she doesn't want him to say anything...*<p>When he was sure Akane was asleep, P-chan ran out of her room repeating over and over in his mind *She doesn't love him...* as if he said it enough, it would be true. P-chan wandered aimlessly for hours until he found himself on the doorstep of a familiar house. He scratched at the door and a beautiful green-haired girl opened the door, but instead of smiling brightly like every time she saw the familiar pig, Akari just picked him up. Akari carried him to the bathroom and turned on a hot bath. laid down his backpack and left the room.<p>Minutes later when Ryoga exited the bathroom, he smiled weakly at Akari, but she just stared at him blankly.<br/>"Hello, Akari," he said.<br/>"Hello, 'P-CHAN," she answered stiffly as Ryoga tensed.<br/>"Y-you know?" he choked out. Akari turned her face towards him and although she had tears in her eyes, determination was also there.<p>"I know, Ryoga. Akane doesn't know, does she? No, don't say anything, I won't tell her," she said as she saw he was about to protest.<br/>"I don't want to know why you did it. I don't want to hear your excuses. Just stop being P-chan," Akari stated.<br/>Ryoga started to argue, "But I-I can't leave Akane, she-"<br/>Akari stood up and said as she pushed Ryoga out the door, "Fine then, Ryoga, I accept that. You never were able to make decisions. You blame Ranma for stringing along Akane, well, what about you stringing me along and expecting me to be there when Akane won't accept you. I won't, Ryoga. So, don't come back to me until you make a permanent decision.<p>With that, she closed the door and Ryoga thought sadly, *She loves me...*<br/>######End of flashback#######<br/>All these men had known the loss of true love and the pain of it, yet they were all allowed a second chance and they got their love back...all but one. Mousse stared wistfully at his son's face and in a brief moment he felt the familiar pang he always felt in the past when Shampoo had insulted or rejected him. The pain was gone, then, replaced by a breathtaking image of a beautiful violet-haired Amazon declaring her love for him under the dim lighting of the Nekohanten.<p>"Now, mom, you have to get married to dad as soon as possible," Urd said.<br/>"Why?" Akane asked curiously.<br/>smiled softly, "Remember, Akane, there are supposed to be three goddesses. You need to give birth to one more daughter before you give birth to any sons."<p>Urd picked up Belldandy and after one last wave they disappeared. Yet, no one had noticed that for once in 7 years, the Nerima crew was back together again, the spirits of Shampoo and Cologne in the room. Uh oh, Nerima is about to be in the top 10 dangerous cities in the world again.<p>Epilogue, 10 years and Ah! My Goddess...<p>Keichii sighed as he listened to Akane, Tifa, Ukyo, Kasumi, Akari, Nodoka and even Nabiki motherly lecture him over the phone on his tendency to get into trouble. Over the years he lived with Mousse and Tifa along with his brothers Condi and Shoner, but he was raised by the Nerima crew. He had 6 mothers (Akane, Tifa, Ukyo, Kasumi, Nodoka, and Nabiki), and 7 fathers (Ranma, Ryoga, Mousse, Soun, Genma, Shiro and ) and a bunch of brothers and sisters. He loved his family dearly and wouldn't change them for the universe, but sometimes they could be so annoying.<p>"Okay, mommy 'kane, mommy Tifa, mommy Ucchan, mommy Kas', mommy 'kari, mommy Nodo', and mommy 'biki. I really have to...uh...go study. Bye!" and he hung up before they could protest.<p>After he hung up, Keichii decided to order a pizza, but dialed the wrong number and had someone tell him he dialed the Goddess Relief Office, whatever that was. Keichii felt tired and worn-out so he decided on a bath. He entered the furo and sighed as he leaned back, but suddenly a magnificent girl climbed out of the wall. He stared in wonder at her, his mouth open. Three triangles adorned her forehead and around her eyes. She had luxurious, long blonde-brown hair and milky green innocent eyes that were so familiar, Keichii jerked back. He jumped out of the furo and grabbed a towel, wrapping it around himself.<p>"W-who are you?" he asked. Okay, maybe it was a little cliché, but how many times does a teenage guy have a beautiful enter the bathroom while he was bathing. Especially, if she entered through the wall.<br/>The goddess smiled beautifully, "I am a goddess, 2nd class. I am here to grant you a wish." *She has to be lying...* Keichii thought.<br/>"I am not permitted to lie and during this conversation, I can read your mind," the goddess said surprising Keichii.<p>"So, I can wish to blow up the world," Keichii asked dubiously.<br/>The Goddess sighed, "Yes, but we prefer not to grant those wishes."<br/>*What to wish for, what to wish for...* Keichii wondered. He could wish to be wealthy, to be famous, to have everything that he ever desires. Suddenly, an image of a laughing, cute, blonde, green-eyed girl appeared in his mind and Keichii's heart wrenched as he knew what he wanted to wish for.<p>"I wish...I wish that my best friend, Belldandy, will come back to me and never leave again," he said. Strangely, the Goddess's eyes glimmered with tears as she whispered, "Oh Keichii-chan..." The triangles on her face glowed and a light surrounded the room. When the light was gone, Keichii looked around the room to see the Goddess still there, the triangles on her face gone.<p>"Why wasn't my wish granted? Where is Bell-chan?" Keichii asked as disappointment ate at him again.<br/>The Goddess stood up and said happily, "Right here, Keichii-chan. The uncute tomboy is right here." With that Keichii remembered why her eyes had effected him so much. He ran to hug her tightly.<br/>"Guess your stuck with me, Keichii-chan," Belldandy said joyfully.<br/>"That's not so bad," Keichii whispered as they hugged again.<br/>THE END<br/>P.S: Oh yeah...and they lived happily ever after.<p>Author's Notes: Wahhhhhhhh! It's done. After so long, I can't believe I<br/>actually finished it. In the words of all those pop-artists after they won<br/>an award, "...Thanx to all my readers...I couldn't have done it without ya.<br/>Love ya, good-bye...buckle your seatbelts, and drive safely."<p>
