</div>Forever Bound<br/>Chapter 9, The Scarlet Rose and Lilac Lily.<p>Author's Notes: Okay, folks I am just going to warn you this chapter is going to include a lot of WAFF(I hope). It also has a little bit of action, but I'm going to attempt WAFF so let's keep our fingers crossed and hope I can do it. Do not asked me why I included a song in here, I just did for the story. You can skip the song and memory part if you want, but don't skip the whole story. Though, I would suggest you read the song and memories part cuz if your careful you might catch one small subtle detail that suggests the answer to a question most of you are wondering. All comments and criticism to silverflame_.<p>Disclaimers: I do not own Ranma 1/2, Rumiko Takahashi does. The song This I promise you is owned by NSYNC and co.<p>Akane bowed with the rest of the cast after the production of The Princess Bride. The crowd stood up and roared on as they did every time before. Akane smiled widely and her smile seemed to reach to everyone in the Auditorium, she really did enjoy acting and lived for these moments. Akane started looking around the Auditorium anxiously *Where is he...?* she thought worridly, but she would never admit it. After all, she haven't even met the guy, yet, for all she knew he could be some sort of arrogant stuck-up jerk. Yet, something inside her told her otherwise...after all if a guy is romantic enough to throw yellow perfect roses at her every play, he couldn't be that bad. Akane mentally slapped herself *Get a grip, girl, just because he's a little romantic doesn't mean anything...*<p>After the large curtains closed Akane let her shoulders droop, she *was* disappointed that he didn't come. Michiko, a midnight-black haired short girl ran up besides Akane.<br/>"Awww, Akane did your  not come today," she laughed jokingly.<br/>"Hush, and leave me alone Michi, I don't care if some wierd pervert doesn't come, in fact I'm happy that he didn't. Hmph!" Akane said proudly. Michiko sighed, she knew Akane was disappointed, but too proud to admit it.<p>"Oh, don't fret over some guy, Akane, tell you what, we'll go out to this dance club I know with our friends tonight and have ourselves good time, k?" Michiko said reassuringly.<br/>"No, thanx, Michi, I have a lot of lines to learn before our next play," Akane gave her a weak smile. Michiko looked doubtful at her.<br/>"Are you sure-?"<br/>"Positive, now hurry up and leave before you be late," laughed Akane as she lightly pushed Michiko towards the back door. Michiko gave Akane a last smile before grabbing her bag and running through the door.<p>Akane sighed heavily and walked towards her changing room, the one with the wooden stallion on the front.<p>Akane pulled her bookbag over her shoulder as she finished wiping off the last of the stage make-up. A single long-stemmed white rose fell from her pack with a note attached to it. Akane smiled at the rose and read the note: The yellow rose stood for friendship and I believe I have gained that already. Now, I hand you the white rose which symbolises the pure soul and heart you have. Akane's eyes sparkeled filled with mirth. She took the rose and note and put it back into her backpack gently.<p>Ranma sat in the almost empty Auditorium watching the stagehands take down the scene and clean up the stage. He briefly wondered what was taking Akane so long as his eyes slowly closed and his head fell onto his right arm. Akane walked out into the Auditorium and spotted Ranma. She ran over to him and she thought *He looks so cute and adorable like that...* her thoughts jerked back at who she was thinking that about *No! This is Ranma, he's like Ryo-chan, like Ucchan,...a friend...forgive and forget, forgive and forget, forgive and forget, forget...forget...I can't...* Akane broke off her thoughts and she hit Ranma on the back of his head.<p>"Wake up, baka, sheesh, I tell you to wait for me for a few minutes and you go and fall asleep," Akane grumbled though her voice was cheerful.<br/>"What? What? I fell asleep?...er...sorry Akane," chuckled Ranma sheepishly.<p>"Anyways, just come on I have a lot of lines to learn before the next play," Akane said as she pulled Ranma up by his arm and dragged him towards the door. Akane's arm would have done serious damage to a normal man, but this was Ranma Saotome. Ranma's grin spread from ear to ear as he felt a tingling warm, yet sizzling sensation where Akane put her arm around his.<p>Ranma looked over at Akane, the wind blowing hard against her face as her blue wispy hair tried to wrap itself around her face. Her face was flushed and a light pink from the wind and her eyes looked out on her side of the car(the place where the window should be, if Ranma had not tooken off the hood of the car). Her eyes sparkeled, but she stared absently as if her whole concentration was on someone pass the horizon. Ranma felt an all too familiar ache and felt that the girl was here, but the heart was not, and couldn't help thinking as if he had lost her again. *Unreachable, yet so near...* both Ranma and Akane thought. Ranma looked back onto the road and tried to clear his mind. His thoughts at that moments were on Akane and they were beyond "friendly".<p>"Um, Akane..." spoke Ranma hesitently trying anything to break the calm yet unnerving silence. Akane turned her deep gaze at Ranma and she asked faintly as if she was in a dream, "Ranma can you take me somewhere?" Ranma looked surprised at her request, but obliged. Akane told him where it was and he drove on wondering what she wanted.<p>Ranma stopped the car by a hillside just as Akane instructed. Akane opened the car door and started to get out as Ranma asked, "You want me to come to, Akane?" Akane just looked at him a moment intently before responding, "Sure, if you want." Ranma turned the car engine off and got out with Akane. Ranma just followed and looked at Akane's back as she continued on, knowing perfectly well where she was going. When Akane walked pass over a small hill Ranma ran after her.<p>After Ranma ran to the top of the hill he saw Akane sit silently hugging her knees beside a crystal glimmering lake. Suddenly, Ranma remembered.<br/>#######Flashback########<br/>Ranma ran over a small hill and sighed *What would that tomboy do here?*. Their fathers had made them go to some party as a couple and he had to admit that Akane did look beautiful in her white dress *Not that she doesn't look beautiful all the time...* Ranma's subcouncious whispered. Ranma steadily ignored it as always. The party went fine, in fact Ranma didn't even know why he was here chasing after her. After the party, Akane just ran off saying she had to think and now he was looking for her. At reaching the top of the hill Ranma gasped at the sight below him.<p>Akane sat next to a large glimmering her dress sprawled around her. Ranma walked silently next to her, his hand still holding the tulip he picked on the otherside of the hill.<br/>Akane looked up into Ranma's eyes and he felt a smile dawn onto his face at her brown eyes. Akane stood up next to him and acting on impulse Ranma slowly offered the tulip to the delicate flower before him, holding the tulip between him and Akane. Akane took the flower from his hand and what was supposed to be only a brush across the hands became the two of them holding hands, her small one wrapped around his which was wrapped around the tulip. They stared at each others, two sides opposing, yet attracting, the tulip their bridge and connection.<p>Suddenly, Ranma heard growling behind him and turned to see very angry, Martial Artists on the hill. His eyes wide Ranma dodged some weapons thrown at him, but a bonbori bounced off his head and knocked him into the crystal clear lake, triggering his curse.<br/>#######End of Flashback############<br/>Ranma stopped his thoughts right there, hoping to stop the pain from erupting in him. It came anyways. Ranma walked next to Akane and sat down looking towards the lake also and suddenly found the infinity of the lake over the horizon soothe his pained soul. *So that's why she comes here...*<br/>Akane spoke up silently letting her musical voice join with the breathtaking atmosphere, "It's nice here isn't it? It sort of makes you forget for awhile everything that's happening around you and allows you to come into your own perfect world where no one's allowed in here." Akane brushed her hand across her heart.<p>"Then, for now, let's just keep everyone out and stay in our world," Ranma barely murmured softly, barely audible, but Akane heard him. Maybe if they weren't here she would have been surprised at his touching words, but the rolling hills and bright moonlight reflecting over the infinite lake brought out any major emotions from her...all except one.<br/>"Yeah, Ranma, just me and you," Akane sighed softly as she straightened, then bended her her knees so they aligned to her left making her more comftorble. Ranma put his right arm around Akane's shoulders as if it was the most natural thing in the world and Akane leaned in closer to him as she laid her head on his shoulder.<p>Neither one thinking, just acting out on their emotions, watching the moonlight. A warm blue hue surrounded the two friends, lovers, enemies, fiancees, whatever, it didn't matter what they were to each other then. They both just knew the person beside them and enjoyed the moment. Exhausted from the chases, from the fights, from the emotional turmoil, and surpressed longing, the two relaxed, asleep and finally restful in spirit.<p>So, like in the old movies, where two old lovers meet again under the starlight, a soft romantic song plays in the background. The song wasn't there, and the music didn't play, but both Ranma and Akane heard the song deep in their hearts and they remembered:<br/>#######Song and memories(flashbacks)######<br/>When the visions around, you bring tears to your eyes,<br/>Akane looks behind the tree she's leaning on to see Ranma happily munching on Ukyo's okonomiyaki and as she turns her head back tears mist her eyes<p>And all that surround you, are secrets and lies,<br/>Ranma pounding on Akane's door telling her to let him in after Cologne and Shampoo's visit. After awhile he leans back against the door and slumps down, bending his knees and putting his head in-betweent the square his arms formed around his knees<p>I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope,<br/>Ranma talking to Akane after she realizes Dr. Tofu didn't love her<p>Keeping your faith when it's gone,<br/>Akane squeezes Ranma's hand at the walk home from Ryukenzawa<p>The one you should call was standing here all along,<br/>Akane stared out at all her admirers at the Chrismas party all trying to attract her attention, she looked passed them to the right seeing Ranma leaning in the doorway smiling at her<p>And I will take you in my arms and hold you right where you belong,<br/>Ranma carrying Akane as the fiancees and rivals chased after them<p>Til the day my life is through, this I promise you...this I promise you,<br/>Akane smiled up looking at Ranma's tear-stained face looking down at her with surprise, shock, and...love?<p>I've loved you forever in lifetimes before,<br/>An old man with dark-black red hair crys over the death of his wife and he lays down next to her dying too.<p>And I promise you never will you hurt anymore,<br/>Ranma runs back to the Tendo dojo after too many insults on his manhood by Tarou and Happosai. He sees Akane waiting at the gate with a kettle in her hands<p>I give you my word, I give you my heart,<br/>Akane stared wide-eyed as Ranma held onto her, even after the Mikado and Azusa's final attack which if he kept holding on would hurt him...bad, but if he lets go she would get hurt<p>This is a battle we've won,<br/>Ranma and Akane walking side-by-side, Soun and Genma's battered form behind them<p>And with this vow, forever has now begun,<br/>Ranma stood akwardly next to Akane stammering trying to say something. He finally stops and says she's cute and runs off<p>Just close your eyes each loving day,<br/>Akane and Ranma close their eyes as they lean forward for a kiss<p>And know this feeling won't go away,<br/>Akane beats up and kicks a dummy across the ground pretending it was Ranma. After awhile she walks over and picks up the dummy, hugging it tight<p>Til the day my life is through, this I promise you...this I promise you,<br/>Ranma feeling down after Happosai took his strength away and Akane sits next to him telling him that to her his strength doesn't matter<p>Over and over I fall, when I hear you call,<br/>Ranma notices how cute Akane looks as she gets ready to hit a softball. The softball heads toward him and knocks him down.<p>Without you in my life, baby, I just wouldn't be living at all,<br/>Ranma runs into the woods yelling after he hears Akane tell Sinnosuke she could love him<p>And I will take you in my arms, and hold you right where you belong,<br/>Ranma and Akane in Akane's bed. The blanket falls off and we notice Akane is only wearing Ranma's red shirt while Ranma wears nothing at all<p>Til the day my life is through, this I promise you, baby,<br/>Ranma leaving the Tendo dojo as he looks towards Akane's window and see her there. They both whisper a single word and Ranma runs off<p>Just close your eyes, each lovin day,<br/>Akane lays asleep in her large bed hugging a photo<p>And know this feeling won't go away,<br/>Ranma lies on the floor of a his small room of a hut, Shampoo sleeping in a different room across from his. Ranma stares at the ceiling, Akane's face in his mind.<p>Every word I say is true, this I promise you,<br/>Akane smiling after she leaves the stage. She enters her changing room, takes an old letter from her backpack and hugs it to her chest as she cries<p>This I promise you,<br/>Ranma grabs a laughing Keichii from behind and puts him on his shoulder<p>I promise you,<br/>Akane tucks Belldandy into bed as she whispers good-night<br/>########End of Song and Memories########<br/>Ranma looks down at Akane and at the same moment she looked up. They could feel and practically see the tension sizzle between them. *Maybe just once...* Akane thought. *It wouldn't hurt...no it would, but it doesn't matter...* Ranma thought. The edged closer together slowly closing the gap.<p>Suddenly, the shrill cry of Akane's phone broke the peace and euphoria dragging them harshly back to reality...a reality without each other. Ranma turned his head away as Akane picked up the phone.<br/>"Hello, yes who is it? What? He's here? Why didn't you tell me? He did? Yeah, I asked him if he wanted to come along with me when I came to Nerima, but he refused. He did? Why do I have to get him though? Fine, I missed him anyways. Okay, okay, bye." Ranma looked curiously as Akane finished talking *Him?*.<p>"Who was that?" questioned Ranma suspiciosly.<br/>"Oh that was afriend of mine, Audrey, she told me my agent came to Nerima. Can you drive me to the hotel to get him?" Akane asked hopefully, obviously very glad to see whoever *he* was. Ranma felt a little green demon rear it's ugly head and he pushed it down saying cheerfully as he stood up, "Sure, come on." Akane smiled even wider and got up following Ranma. The two walked away from the lake, not forgetting what they had shared back there.<p>Ranma stopped the car in front of a large fancy hotel in Tokyo. He watched Akane get out and looked around until she spotted a man with jet-black hair cut into a short stylish fashion. The man's dark eyes sparkeled joyously at seeing Akane and Ranma saw a dark brown haired woman behind him. The woman was mildly short with yellow highlights in her hair. Ranma could easily tell she was a foreigner. Two little boys, twins, stood next to her fidgeting until they saw Akane. Ranma noted how the woman's and two boys eyes twinkled excitedly at seeing Akane.<br/>Yet, this would all seem normal and if you were a Martial Artist named Ranma Saotome, normal wasn't in your vocabulary...but shock was. Akane ran to hug the group as the man and woman yelled, "Akane!" The two boys yelled, "Auntie 'kane!" and Akane yelled joyously back to all of them, "Mousse! Tifa! Con Di and I Xion Er! I'm so glad you guys came!"<p>Ranma stared dumbfounded as Akane and the group hugged. He wasn't that all surprised at seeing Mousse, he was going to go look for him anyways, but the woman and children surprised him. *Mu Tsu has a wife...he has children...oh, the Amazons are soooo going to kill me...* he thought as he knocked his head on the steering wheel.<p>Author's Notes: What do ya think? Now, I have aquestion for ya, when Ranma had the first flashback in this chapter, what do you think I was trying to refer to that actually showed that actually was shown in the Ranma 1/2 series? C'mon guess. At least try!<p>
