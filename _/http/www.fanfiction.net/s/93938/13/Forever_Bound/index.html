</div>Forever Bound<br/>Chapter 12, Why we do what we do...<p>Author's Notes: Haha! Okay a lot of you took for granted in the last chapter that Ranko meant Ranma's girl half. There's more then one person who has the name Ranko you know. Leave an open mind, Ranko doesn't nessacary mean Ranma's girl half. Also, in the sidestory Chapter 11(b), it held a lot of question that will be answered in my future chapters. I am so sorry it took me so long to post. School has been...hectic lately. All comments and criticism to silverflame_.<p>Disclaimers: I don't own Ranma 1/2, Rumiko Takahashi does. Tell me if you still care belongs to Monica.<p>(Tendo Home, Living Room)<br/>Akane sat on the couch hugging Belldandy's sleeping form close to her as Ranma watched her. Ukyo, Shiro, Ryoko, and Tenchi had already gone back to Ucchan's and Ryoga and Akira left to go back home also. Genma and Nodoka went home and Nabiki and Kuno drove off, Nabiki wanting to find out what happened to Ranma the past 2 years. Soun lay asleep upstairs in his room nad Kasumi had stayed with Dr. Tofu at the clinic.<p>After awhile Akane looked up, her brown eyes staring sadly at Ranma. "Why didn't you tell me? Shan Pu, she didn't deserve that."<br/>Ranma sighed, "I know."<br/>Akane looked at Ranma trying to figure out an idea that was still foggy in her mind.<br/>Ranma looked up, his eyes staring blankly at Akanes'.<br/>"I know you want to ask it Akane, so go ahead. Don't hide behind those eyes of yours anymore, ask what you want," Ranma whispered his words filled with hurt.<br/>Akane looked at Ranma, wondering if she should ask. If she even wanted to know. *Why can't I just let it go...* Akane wondered *...what if...why am I putting myself in more pain...?* Akane breathed out a long sigh and whispered hesitently, "Did you ever love Shan Pu?"<p>Ranma's eyes misted over, a memory playing itself over and over in his mind. Ranm saw Shampoo cooking dinner, Shampoo laughing, Shampoo smiling.<br/>"Yeah, I did...and I still do," Ranma whispered. *Just not the way you think though, Akane...* Ranma thought *Then tell her that!* his mind screamed back at him. Ranma didn't know why, but strangely he didn't tell Akane this, knowing fully well what she would think. Maybe it was because he wanted her to hurt as much as he had over the years...that is she would hurt...if she still cared.<p>Akane sucked in her breath, her heart squeezing powerfully. Knowing the truth Akane couldn't help, but feel that dark void calling to her again. *Why'd he have to say this? Couldn't he have lied?* cried Akane's heart *...but would I be happier knowing I stayed with a man that gave his heart to someone else.*<p>"Did you ever love me like you loved Shampoo?" Akane questioned fearfully wondering to herself if she wanted to answer to be yes or no.<br/>"No," stated Ranma plaintedly. He saw Akane's face flinch and he felt his heart twist. *She hurt you, hurt her back* his mind kept telling him, but yet why was revenge so painful?<p>"Never?" Akane asked grasping at her only hope , her only weapon against the darkness.<br/>"Maybe, once, but it changed somehow, I'm sorry," Ranma said his voice not one bit sincere for he would never be sorry for...<br/>Akane knew the only way to keep the void away was the ice, so she called onto it. Akane froze her emotions, freezing all pain, all depression...all hope.<br/>She stood up and held Belldandy's small body close to hers tightly.<br/>"Thank you, Ranma. I'm really happy that you found something so precious and not have the person break your heart. At least you knew that the one you loved left not of her own choice. You'll find someone again, Ranma, I know. Someone like you can't live alone, the kami plan it. I know you'll find someone you'll love just as much or more then you love Shan Pu and you'll love her with all your heart until the day you die. That's the way you are Ranma, you don't keep many things, but if someone does manage there way into your heart and soul, you'll never let them go. I know," Akane said stiffly holding back the hot tears she felt in the back of her eyes.<p>Ranma felt rage boil in his veins giving him energy over the pain. How dare she? First she goes and steal his heart, hurting him with her every insult, her every hit! When they finally come to show there feelings for each other and he had to leave, she had the nerve to keep his heart...not that he wanted it back. Then, he has to go day after agonizing day without her, without his soul, without his heart, her face forever etched in his mind. To forever long for her and feel his heart breaking everytime he remembered her face. She always crept back into his mind, where she had no buisness being! She had tempted him with chances of love and happiness and he had actually believed her! To think that she had done something others failed to even imagine doing and doing it without even trying! That was what had really upset him before, that she had managed to get him to love her without even trying and others had failed it when they were so much better. Shan Pu had the body that a greek goddess would be jealous of and a strong mind that could have won any man over, *kamis* she even crawled naked in bed with him!<p>Then there was Ucchan. Here was a cute girl with her own resteraunt and had the mind of an understanding friend that guys usually only find among themselves, but she added a strange femenity to it that proved she could make anyone a perfect wife. There were the girls that didn't actively chase after him, but he could have won over if he wanted. Kasumi, who would make a great mother and wife, a radiant example of the perfect female. Nabiki, who though manipulative had a great body and a sharp mind that would make sure that her husband never became poor. Kadachi...ug...well she had her good qualities...she was a gardener and a gymnastic...and she was rich! All this and not counting the endless girls that had fallen in love with him and he went and had fallen in love with a girl that hurt him over and over gain.<p>Why did he love Akane? Ranma sometimes wondered late at night. The answer he came up with was a blank. He could list the reasons why he could love another girl and yet when it came to Akane, he was full of reasons and yet not a single one. He loved her smile, he loved her mind, he loved her heart, everything...but when he asked himself a strong plausible reasonable answer... it came up again. However, whenever was love reasonable?<p>Now, now she had the...the...gall to accuse him of this! She, who hurt him more and more by just being near and yet unreachable. Like a temptress slowly weaving her spell over the unsuspecting prince. Well he's had enough!<p>"Oh, don't point the accusing finger Akane and try to blame the guilt on me. Were you really that faithful, Akane, huh? How do you expect me to keep myself loyal to you when you had lain back and given yourself to someone else! So, was Belldandy born in wedlock, Akane? Was she? Did her father even bothered to stay? He probably left you, huh Akane? Probably abandoned you when you needed him most and broke your heart in the process, right? Well, stop blaming and hurting others Akane for your own mistakes! Get over it, he left you, stop trying to hurt others!" yelled Ranma. Belldandy woken up in Akane's arms and Akane held her daughter close as the uncontrollable tears streamed down her face like a waterfall washing all her hurt in every drop.<p>Akane slapped Ranma across the face leaving a dark red mark and a broken lip only slightly bleeding, but the pain seared deep through Ranma.<br/>"NEVER, EVER say anything like that again! I loved Belldandy's father and will never regret loving him. So, are you happy now, Ranma, knowing that I had given my heart to a man and had him leaving me? I regret many things Ranma, but don't you EVER EVEN THINK of making me feel guilty for having Belldandy, because you will fail! You thought I meant to hurt you, Ranma, when I said that. I wanted to wish you a good luck in finding your love, but I guess your too much of a bastard to understand that! Gosh Ranma, get over yourself, not everything is about YOU! You know what I would tell Belldandy's father if I saw him now? I would tell him to GO TO HELL!" Akane screamed hysterically before ran crying out of the house, Belldandy's scard form clutched close to her.<p>Ranma stood there awed. *Why did I do that? Why'd I say that,... I had control before, but why...* he thought before he saw something at the corner of his eye that sent the anger flaring through him again. On the small coffee table sat a candle, a light candle nothing out of the ordinary, dancing in the moonlight. Ranma knew better however, few could catch the intricate pattern that the candle danced. Ranma gave a menacing growl and ran from the room.<p>Ranma ran to the dark park and stood next to the lake. Trees loomed around him, the shadows waiting patiently. Ranma ran and stood next to the lake as he put his right arm out. A small speck of fire floated in front of him. Ranma threw the fire to the ground and a large wave from the lake splashed onto the fire.<br/>"Appear yourself before me, Ranko, and leave me no choice. Fire lost water, again and again, rasha, ashar," chanted Ranma.<br/>A beautiful, short, long red-haired girl appeared behind Ranma, rubbing her body against his and covering his eyes with her small hands. The girl could pass for innocent if not for the devilish glint in her amber eyes.<p>The girl gave a giggle. "Come now, is that any way to treat your wife Ranma?" the girl whispered in his ear. Ranma spun around angrily, out of her grasp and the girl pouted.<br/>"I told you before, Ranko, that just because you tied my pinky finger and your pinky finger together when we were asleep does not make you my wife. I told you not to follow me, Ranko, I thought you understood. I don't want you near me," Ranma growled.<p>Ranko's pout turned into a scowl, "No, Ranma, I don't understand. You love me, we're supposed to be together. It's destiny."<br/>"I don't want you near me, Ranko. I don't want you using your fire to manipulate me or Akane's feelings again or I will break the magic right then and there and we all know what that mean, don't we?" said Ranma menacingly.<p>"Ranma, I didn't manipulate your feelings, I just exaggerated it to a larger scale. She did hurt you, Ranma, your not supposed to be with her. Open up you memories, Ranma and listen," Ranko said sweetly as she held out her hands and a large red ball grew shooting towards Ranma.<p>Ranma shook his head, "Don't you even dare try that memory trick again, Ranko!" Yet, it was already too late for the red light enveloped Ranma and Ranko opened his memories...to her adavantage.<br/>######Memory, 1500 years before#######<br/>Lachalarn walked down the large elaborate hallway, his blond pig-tail wving behind him, a life of it's own. Larchlarn's shoes clicked on the marble cloud floors and his lightening sword sat on his back. Larchlarn stopped to look out one of the large windows to the beautiful garden below. Flowers, plants, animals, magic, potions, all sorts of things grew in this garden of his. Larchlarn looked more carefully at the window seeing his reflection, his dewy green eyes staring back at him. Suddenly, Larchlarn felt small hands cover his eyes and a giggle from behind. *Grenada...* he thought.<p>"Guess who?" the bubbly voice giggled.<br/>"Oh I don't know, Darcredi? Aphrodite? Salenity?" Larchlarn asked in an innocent tone.<br/>Grenada turned her fiancee around and pouted at him. "No, just your fiancee Grenada." Larchlarn looked at his fiancee, she was very beautiful, anybody could see this. Her amber eyes and striking red hair marked her right as the Fire Princess. Larchlarn guessed he had loved his fiancee, who couldn't, she was beautiful, intelligent, funny, everything a man could want. Larchlarn scoffed at all the Earth poets, those that claimed all the things that love was. *Love, hah! Love, soulmates, a deep understanding, an utter dependency on another being. This does not exist for no one is a fool enough to let such a thing happen to them. This is love, I have a beautiful fiancee, what more is there to want? Drowning in someone's eyes, contentment in their precense, staying with someone forever, what rubbish these imbeciles talk of* Larchlarn thought as he gazed at his fiancee.<p>"That's good enough for now," Larchlarn whispered as Grenada giggled again. Larchlarn sometimes wished the girl would stop pretending that everything he said was so funny, but if she wanted to pretend, so be it.<p>"What are you doing?" asked Grenada lazily as she reveled in his embrace.<br/>"Just thinking," Larchlarn simply said. He did not say anything more and she didn't ask, not that he would tell her. He didn't need to care what she thought and she didn't need to care about what he thought.<br/>"Oh,...Larchlarn are you happy here?" Grenada asked wearily, an urgency for his answer in her tone.<br/>"Of course, my dear, this palace is lovely," Larchlarn said.<p>Grenada twisted around to face him, "No, what I mean is, will you stay here, forever. Father and Mother wants you to, you know. You won't have a home anywhere else, but here."<br/>Larchlarn looked down at Grenada and said, "I'm sorry Grenada. This palace is wonderful, my whole life was here, I'll miss it, but I want to go...I have to go. I can't stay here, nothing can hold me...anywhere. I'll miss you Grenada, I will, but you can't hold me back. Don't feel bad, no one can hold me back. I'll be leaving in the forthnight."<p>Grenada looked sadly at him, he was always like this, "Will you come back? We still have to get married you know."<br/>Larchlarn smiled, " I don't know if I'll come back, but if I marry anyone, it'll be you, okay?" Grenada smiled, coming from Larchlarn that was good enough.<p>A servant wearing a blood-red dress appeared before them.<br/>"Excuse me, Lady Grenada, the King wishes to speak to you," the girl said.<br/>Grenada smiled one last time at Larchlarn before disappearing.<p>Larchlarn looked out of the window back at the garden, only this time he saw the silhoutte of a cape and hood. The cape wasn't red, but a deep violet...that meant the person was either a guest or an intruder...and Larchalrn didn't hear the palace was going to have any guests.<p>Larchlarn diappeared in a flash of blue and reappeared in the garden next to the shadowy figure. Larchlarn grabbed the person's elbow and turned them to face him.<br/>"Who are you?" Larchlarn demanded. The person's hood fell off and Larchlarn gasped. There stood a flushed magnificent angel. Her dark blue hair framing her face and what struck Larchlarn the most was the large beautiful deep yet light brown eyes that stared up at him. Those eyes seemed to mesmerize him, tempting him to drown. The world fell apart and all that was left were those eyes...so brown...so rich. The girl breathed and the cold hair froze her warm breath. The hot breath appeared between them and Larchlarn drank it in, as he started to feel light-headed. *She's so beautiful...no, Grenada is beautiful...she's...she's radiant, breathtaking, magnificant, angelic, cute...kawaii...*<p>The girl breathed out and said softly, "My name is Marshidi." That was what she said before flipping Larchlarn onto his bottom.<br/>#######End of Memory########<br/>Ranko stopped suddenly. She hadn't meant to show him *that* much, she couldn't let him remember *her*. Ranko had only meant to show him the vision between them, but now...it was too late. Ranko looked at the sarene expression on Ranma's face suddenly turn pained as he yelled out, "No! Shidi! Don't go!" Yes it was too late.<br/>The red light faded and Ranma looked accusingly at Ranko, "What did you do to me, you witch!"<br/>Ranko swallowed the lump in her throat, "I made you remember. Too bad that you remembered too much though."<p>Ranma just shook his head vehemently and whispered before he bounded away, "Just stay away from me and Akane."<br/>Ranko shook her head sadly and said, "Sorry, Ranma, no can do. You'll see me again, but until then, au revoir my love."<p>Akane sat on the swing, her tears streaming silently down her face as she watched Belldandy play on the playground. Akane heard someone besides her and she turned to her left to see a girl had sat on the swing beside her. The girl was pretty, Akane noted, with her dark glossy black hair, almost green and those deep violet eyes. *Yup, a perfect Ranma-can-be-fiancee candidate* Akane noted grimly and shook her head. *What am I thinking, I'm not this bitter...*<p>"You okay?" the girl asked, "You look kinda sad. Guy trouble?"<br/>Akane laughed dryly at how right the girl was, "Yeah, though you can't really say guy trouble. Probably, Guy-turned-girl trouble." At the girl's thoroughly confused glance, Akane burst out laughing, more out of the need to then the actual joke.<br/>"Don't ask," Akane said.<br/>The girl raised one eyebrow, "In this case, don't worry, I won't. So you okay?"<p>"Yeah, I'll get over it," *I hope...*<br/>"So what's your name? Mine's Akane," Akane said.<br/>"Mine's Grenada, but just call me Da-chan, I hate formalities," Grenada said as she smiled. Akane giggled.<br/>"Yeah I hate formailities, just call me Akane," Akane said.<br/>Grenada just smiled sweetly. Maybe it was the trick of the light, but if Akane bothered to look, she would have seen a glint of fire in Grenada's eyes.<p>Tell me, if you still care<br/>Tell me, if you still care<br/>Let me know<br/>Have you started to lose your love for me<br/>And if so<br/>Will you still continue to be on my side<br/>Tell me, if you still care<br/>About me (Tell me that you care)<br/>Tell me, if you still care<br/>About me<br/>Must we both, go on being confused<br/>And placing blame<br/>My heart knows, that you're my number one<br/>Do you feel the same way too<br/>Tell me, if you still care<br/>About me (Tell me)<br/>Tell me, if you still care (Will you still care for me baby)<br/>Oh yes<br/>Yes, I know, that I still love you<br/>You're forever on my mind<br/>And it's so hard to let go, what I feel for you<br/>You blow my mind<br/>But you captured all my love with your sweetness<br/>And you gave it to me baby, from your heart<br/>Oh, so if we really care for each other<br/>Then tell me baby, why are we apart, yeah<br/>Tell me, if you still care (That you still care)<br/>About me (About me)<br/>Tell me (I wanna know) if you still care<br/>Do you feel the same way too (Do you feel the same way baby, for me)<br/>Tell me, if you still care (Will you hold me and will you kiss me)<br/>About me (Can you tell me)<br/>Tell me, if you still care (Will you hold me and will you kiss me baby)<br/>(Can you tell me) Do you feel the same way too<br/>Tell me, if you still care<br/>Listen to my heart beat<br/>When you hold me, when you kiss me<br/>(If you still care) Can you tell me<p>Author's Notes: Plaese don't be mad it took me so long to get this posted. I tried, but then I had some problems in my school and then one thing led to another and I haven't really got to writing yet. I hope my fans are still reading even after the sidestory.<p>
