</div>Forever Bound<br/>Chapter 11, Explanations and Decisions<p>Author's Notes: Okay here's the next chapter which will explain the last chapter. Now some of you may find the explanation I had on why Keichii was Mousse's son may be a little weak, but what can I say? I rather find my explanation resonable. Remember all comments and criticism to silverflame_.<p>Disclaimers: I don't own Ranma 1/2, Rumiko Takahashi does.<p>Ranma heard his son's words and held him back before he could strike an awed Mousse. He stared quizzically down at his son and so did everyone else. Keichii understood his father's reaction and replied stiffly, "The Honored Elders have told me that father Mu Tsu had abandoned my mother. They had told me that if you fail to retrieve him back to the village, that it is my duty to give him the punishment he deserves. It is the only way to gain back the honor I have lost for being born out of wedlock."<p>Ranma scowled at his son. "Cay Xi, I have told you before that you lose no honor from being born out of wedlock. I have also told you that you should not listen to everything the Honored Elders have told you if you do not believe it is right. Can you honestly tell me that you find it right to kill your blood father? Would Shan Pu be proud of her son if he did?" Ranma questioned.<p>Cay Xi looked definite for a moment before he collapsed in his father's arms. What really stung Mousse was that the one Cay Xi was hugging for support from was Ranma, not himself.<br/>"I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry that I can not be the strong warrior that the Elders expect of me. I just can't kill him...I just can't..." Keichii cried bitterly in Ranma's shoulder as Ranma soothed him.<p>Akane looked at Ranma and said awed, "...but you said he was your son when I asked you-" She said no more as Ranma looked at her with a determined glare, "Cay Xi is my son. I am his father. That fact does not change even if I was not his blood father. I was the one that watched him grow, that taught him, that disciplined him. Shan Pu was his mother and Mu Tsu was his father...but I am his dad. Never forget that Akane."<p>"How?" whispered Mousse softly not quite grasping the thought yet. Ranma gave a long sigh and said, "Everyone take a seat, this may take awhile." Everyone looked at him before seating themselves somewhere in the small room.<p>Ranma began, "Okay, I will relate to you what Shan Pu had told me just before she died. Two days after the failed wedding Shan Pu began to seriously doubt her feelings for me so she drank a potion that she had found in Kol One's drawer. Three hours after she drank it she sought out Mu Tsu here and led him back to the Nekohanten and...um...slept with him." At that everyone once again turned their quiet expression at a red-faced Mousse.<p>Ranma continued on, "The next morning after it happened however...<br/>######Flashback, Nekohanten#######<br/>Mousse woke up drowsily and smiled as he noticed he was in Shan Pu's bed. It had happened...Shan Pu had loved him. He heard noise downstairs and ran quickly downstairs. Once there he saw Shampoo sweeping the Nekohanten angrily while she muttered incoherantly.<p>"Um...Shan Pu?" Mousse asked slowly. Shampoo suddenly looked at him then, a fiery expression on her face.<br/>"What stupid duck boy want now?" she yelled irratedly. Mousse flinched, his insides quaking at the thought that yesterday didn't happen.<br/>"About last night..." he said softly. Shampoo's expression turned from furious to a deathly cold calm.<p>Shampoo continued sweeping and said nonchalantly, "That nothing. Nothing happen, duck boy understand? Shan Pu miss airen, Shan Pu find replacement. Mean nothing." Mousse stood there stunned as he practically saw his heart break in front of him and he screamed, "Nothing? Nothing? How can you say that Shan Pu after-" He didn't get to finish for Shampoo had already threw the broom at him passing inches from his face before hitting the wall with a thud.<p>"Stupid duck boy no understand? Shan Pu say it nothing. Shan Pu say over and over again, but Mu Tsu too too stupid to understand. Shan Pu no love you. Shan Pu love only airen, Shan Pu marry Ranma," Shampoo yelled back and whispered softly as she bowed her head, "Shan Pu must marry Ranma." Yet, Mousse did not hear her heartfelt words for he had already ran from the Nekohanten.<p>Tears stung Mousse's face as he ran along the rooftops. *Have to get away...away...away..from her...from him...away...* Mousse had no idea what force carried him to such a place, but he did not question it for it provided an answer to his problems and pain. So silently, Mousse walked into the Tokyo National Airport.<br/>########End of Flashback#########<br/>"...after that Mu Tsu didn't come back, but little did he expect three months later..."<br/>#######Flashback, Nekohanten#####<br/>Shan Pu ran urgently into the Nekohanten yelling at all the customers to leave and that their meal was free. After all she had more urgent things to deal with then a days lost profit. Shampoo ran next to her Cologne who was sitting by the register at the time.<p>"Hiba-chan! Hiba-chan, something bad happen, Shan Pu pregnant!" Shampoo exclaimed. Cologne shook her head.<br/>"I know," she said. Shampoo looked terror striken at her great-grandmother.<br/>"And I'm guessing the child is not son-in-laws'," stated Cologne.<p>Shampoo shook her head, "How?"<br/>Cologne bounded and pulled Shampoo's shirt so that Shampoo bended down and their noses were only inches away.<br/>"I know everything, granddaughter," Cologne cracked before she hopped away.<br/>"The child is Mu Tsu's. I see it in the baby's aura. It is a faint lilac and grey. The exact color to yours and Mu Tsus'. Ah! I see you are afraid. I will not ask how it happened, but you do know that the village will not allow you back with a fatherless child, correct?" Shampoo nodded lifelessly.<p>"I have thought this for awhile and we will tell son-in-law that it is his child," Cologne said matter-of-factly.<br/>Shampoo shook her, "But, Ranma has not-" Cologne cut her off, "We'll just tell him that we gave him some passion spice and he did do *that* with you. It was just that the aftermath of the spice was when that he awoke he forgot. We did not bother to tell him since we did not have proof and he would not have believed us. Then, we found out you were pregnant and we had the proof we wanted. To salvage his honor, son-in-law will marry you."<p>Shampoo's look turned incredulous, "They will know we lied."<br/>"No they will not, not if we could prove the child was Ranma's," before Shampoo could get to asking how, Cologne pulled a small bottle from her pocket filled with a brown clear liquid.<br/>"I have put some of son-in-laws blood into this. When you drink this potion it will alternate the child's aura color, it will change the grey of Mu Tsu's to a rich blue which is Ranma's aura. If we could get Dr. Tofu to read the child's aura, he will convince the others that the child does indeed belong to you and Ranma. Now, this will only last 2 weeks so we must leave before then. Drink now, child," Cologne urged as she handed Shampoo the bottle.<p>Shampoo held the bottle to her lips and hesitated, "But, it not right. Shan Pu know Ranma love pervert girl. It not right."<br/>Cologne gave a dry laugh, "Do you gain a sense of morality now, child, after all the things you have done in the pass. If your sense of morality could stress to ruin his wedding and even appear before him naked numerous times, can you not do this?"<br/>Shampoo looked indignant for a second, "Shan Pu know what Shan Pu do before not right, Shan Pu understand now. Shan Pu no try to excuse actions. Just know this not right."<br/>"Would you rather have the village shun you, for I can not protect you on this point? Do you wish to wander aimlessly forever in a country where people don't understand you? Would you not rather be home? This is your decision Shan Pu, do what is right and live a miserable life hating your child for bringing it upon you or do what is best and be able to come home at last. Be a true and proud Amazon for once, Shan Pu, and make the right decision," cried Cologne.<p>"Shan Pu be Amazon, be strong...Shan Pu sorry Ranma," Shampoo whispered before she drank the bottle.<br/>Cologne smiled, "Good, great-granddaughter, now we must have a visit with son-in-law."<br/>#########End of Flashback#######<br/>"...and after that, they made the inevitable visit to the Tendo Training Hall..." Ranma said as everyone except Mousse, Tifa, and the children shuddered.<br/>"What visit?" asked Mousse.<br/>"Well..."<br/>########Flashback, Tendo Living Room######<br/>Cologne and Shampoo burst into the living room of the Tendo home. Genma and Soun sat playing shogi as Ranma and Akane sat watching t.v. and Nabiki sat calculating her months profits and few losses. Everyone looked at the two Amazons as Kasumi walked into the room.<p>"What do'ya want Shampoo?" Ranma asked amazed that the Amazon had not glomped onto him yet.<br/>"Airen come home with Shan Pu to China now. Shan Pu pregnant," Shan Pu said.<br/>Ranma shout up straight from his chair at the accusing glares he recieved. "Hey, waita minute, Shampoo. You can't be pregnant, and if you are it ain't mine, cuz I didn't...um...didn't um...didn't..." at this he blushed.<br/>"Didn't what, Ranma?" Nabiki growled.<p>"I didn't sleep wit' her ok?" Ranma yelled then blushed.<br/>"Ah, you wouldn't remember son-in-law. How could you? Some time ago, I had fed you passion spice and as you irrevelantly put it, you did 'sleep' with Shan Pu, but had just forgotten. We decided not to tell you because you would not have believed us," Cologne said resonably. Ranma started laughing.<p>"Is that the best you can come up with? Ha! If I had slept with Shampoo you would have way been on my case about it," Ranma laughed.<br/>"We have proof son-in-law. Call that doctor you all know. He can read auras and the child's aura will certainly tell him that the baby is yours'," Cologne smiled.<br/>Ranma smiled confidently, "There's no reason to-" He was cut short by a Akane, however, "Kasumi, call Dr. Tofu, tell him to come right over."<p>Ranma turned his questioning gaze at Akane, "You don't think that I would...would you, Akane?" Akane looked blankly at Ranma. "We'll see," was all she said.<p>Dr. Tofu arrived and the situation was explained to him. Dr. Tofu looked at Shampoo intently as she fidgeted. After awhile he gasped and turned his ashen face towards Ranma.<br/>"Ranma, the child is yours," he said.<br/>"What?" can be heard from Ranma and others. All except Akane who sat stiffly looking straight ahead.<br/>"Surely, this can't be true?" screamed Ranma. Dr. Tofu just nodded his head pityingly.<br/>"See, son-in-law, now you must marry Shan Pu or be an honorless fool and let her be abandoned from the Amazons," Cologne pointed out.<br/>Ranma looked aghast a moment before saying softly as if accepting his death, " I will marry Shampoo..." A gasp was heard sharply from Akane who though still looking forward had tears in her eyes.<p>"Excuse me..." Akane whispered before running up the steps and closing her bedroom door. Ranma ran after Akae and screams and pounding was heard from Ranma begging Akane to let him in. After awhile it quieted and all that was heard was the sobs Soun.<br/>"Tell, son-in-law that we will expect him to end and meet all of his...erm...arrangments by the end of the week and should be at the Nekohanten ready for leave to China," said Cologne as she practically dragged Shampoo from the Tendo home.<br/>########End of Flashback########<br/>Tears had entered many eyes after having the painful memory brought again. Yet Ranma continued on after he had cleared the lump in his throat, "...so I moved to China with Shampoo the following week and spent 5 years at Joketsuzoku before Shan Pu got bitten by a snake in training and died. She told me this before she died..."<br/>#######Flashback, Joketsuzoku village, inside a hut######<br/>Shampoo held onto Ranma's hand after telling him everything.<br/>"I'm very sorry, Ran Mae. Maybe I have failed and had maid the wrong choice. I knew I made a foolish decision, I know that now. Sometimes I wonder if. If I didn't take the potion. If I didn't sleep with Mu Tsu. If I didn't lie. Would we be any happier? I don't know how I could have made things better, but I know I could have. I know, Ran Mae, I know you still love her. Go to her after I die, Ran Mae, be happy again, at least in death I shall know I have owned up to some of my mistakes," Shampoo spoke softly in perfect chinese.<p>Ranma spoke again also in chinese, "I can't Shan Pu. Not anymore, don't feel guilty, if it was meant to be nothing could have broken it."<br/>At that Shampoo swiped Ranma's arm though weakly, "Do not be sturpid, Ran Mae. Do you know what you are giving up? It is meant to be and it's not broken..yet, but you are breaking it. I did not live with you for 5 years without knowing a thing or two about you."<p>Ranma laughed softly, "So you know me, huh?"<br/>Shan Pu sniffed, " A stranger could know you. Your like a book...if you ever bother to open up. Yet, the only one you've willingly opened up to and love was her."<br/>"Your not jealous?" Ranma asked already knowing the answer.<br/>"If it was someone else, Ran Mae, maybe, after all I am your wife, though you forget, but not from her. I may be a warrior, Ran Mae, but I know when you have already lost. I may have won the battle, but in the end, I lost the war," Shan Pu smiled knowingly.<p>"Do you regret spending these 5 years with me Ran Mae?" Shan Pu asked.<br/>"I regret a lot of things Shan Pu. I regret losing my friends. I regret losing my family. I regret being lied to. I regret going to Jusynko. I regret ever leaving with my father. The thing I most regret, though, is not having her with me, and for ever leaving her,...I regret that every moment of my life. But no, Shan Pu, I do not regret spending time with you and Cay Xi these past 5 years," Ranma sighed as Shampoo smiled softly.<p>"The stars are so beautiful Ran Mae, so bright..." Shan Pu said to Ranma. Ranma looked confused, what was she talking about, it was daytime and she could not possibly see the sky with the hut roof blocking the way.<br/>"What are you talking about Shan Pu?" Ranma asked worridly gripping on her hand tighter.<br/>"So beautiful...Ran Mae, promise me you'll keep caring for Cay Xi. Promise me you'll raise him to become a warrior. And promise me that you'll let him meet his real father one day," Shan Pu asked urgently though weakly.<p>"I promise, to all three," whispered Ranma as he looked at Shan Pu's peaceful face.<br/>Suddenly Shampoo's eyes started to close and she said in Japenese, "Shampoo always love Mousse. Shampoo always love her duck boy. Wo ai ni, Mu Tsu. Shampoo love you." Then, Ranma watched as Shampoo closed her eyes completely and her body gew limp.<br/>"I'm sure he knows," Ranma whispered softly in her ear. Outside an unnatural wind carried a lilac and a duck feather into Cay Xi's small hands.<br/>######End of Flasback#########<br/>Mousse wiped a tear from his eyes as so did many others who weren't already crying, all the bitterness that wasn't already gone fro the Amazon was swept away with Ranma's story.<br/>"Before I left though, the Amazons made me find Mu Tsu and bring him back for his punishment within two years," Ranma said.<br/>"You didn't arrive at Nerima until over two months ago. What happened during these 2 years?" questioned Nabiki suspiciously.<p>Ranma fidgeted in his chair, "Things I'd rather not talk about,"<br/>Nabiki made it a point to find out what happened later.<br/>"What was the potion that Shampoo drank?" asked Dr. Tofu.<br/>"The one that made her sleep with Mu Tsu?" Ranma asked as Dr. Tofu nodded.<br/>Ranma looked stright at Mousse, "Way of True Love."<p>Mousse smiled a bittersweet smile. He held his arms out to Keichii and everyone waited at Keichii's response. Before Keichii walked over to Mousse however Belldandy shot up from bed.<br/>"No! You can't kill Mommy!" yelled Belldandy as everyone directed their attention at the small girl.<br/>Akane held her daughter to her chest and soothed her, "It's just a nightmare, Bell. Now who wants to kill me?"<br/>Belldandy sobbed in her mother's shoulder, "The lady with the red hair, Mommy. The lady with the red hair with fire that wants to kill you."<p>Everyone was too stunned looking at Belldandy to notice Ranma turn pale and mutter one single word, "Ranko..."<p>Author's Notes: I hate cliffhangers, so why do I do them?<p>
