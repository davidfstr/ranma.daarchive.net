</div>Forever Bound<br/>Chapter 10, Son of the Amazons<p>Author's Notes: Yay! I've posted! Okay this chapter is going to bring out a HUGE secret. Well not that big, but big enough. Some of you might have guessed it already, but I'm pretty sure someone would be surprised. Okay, just read this chapter.<p>Disclaimers: I don't own Ranma 1/2, Rumiko Takahashi does.<p>Mousse, Tifa, Con Di and Xion Er climbed into the back seat of Ranma's car while Akane sat in the front seat. Mousse sent a quizzical look at Akane indicating his unasked question of why their driver was banging his head on the steering wheel muttering "I'm dead...I'm dead...I'm dead..." Akane looked at Ranma and asked surprised as she touched his arm, "Ranma...what are you doing?"<p>Ranma turned his head to look at her before turning it back towards Mousse and his family and gave them a sheepish smile.<br/>"Um...hi Mu Tsu...long time no see," he said as he chuckled nervously. Mousse stared at the Ranma awestricken and gave a surprised shreek, "RANMA!"<br/>Ranma cringed at the shout and whispered, "Yeah, it's me."<br/>Mousse's vistage suddenly turned dark and fiery was read clerly in his eyes along with a little...joy? "Where's Shan Pu? And Kol One? Did they come with you?" he asked.<p>For some unknown reason to Mousse, Ranma's face contorted in pain as if he had been struck. Suddenly anger took his place and yelled, "Why don't you tell me since you were the one that left her!" That brought everyone's attention towards Ranma and Mousse asked, "What?"<p>Ranma shook his head sadly as if he didn't even meant to say that. *I can't tell him now...he has his own family...I guess I'll face the Amazons on my own...* Ranma thought.<br/>"Mu Tsu, can we talk after we come back to the Tendo dojo?" Ranma asked as Mousse slowly nodded. Ranma nodded also and drove off.<p>Mousse sat next to his wife on the couch as his twin sons Con Di and Xion Er ran around playing with Keichii and Belldandy. Ranma sat across from him, Akane next to Ranma.<br/>"Ranma,-" Mousse began, but Ranma held up his hand to stop him from continuing.<br/>Ranma rubbed his hand to his head as if trying to prevent a headache from arriving. "Mu Tsu, before you say anything. Answer me if Tifa is your wife and Con Di and Xion Er really your children?" Ranma asked.<p>"Yes, but why-" Mousse began before he was once again interrupted only this time by a loud noise outside. Kasumi ran into the house as Genma, Soun, and the 4 kids ran out of the house to see who caused the commotion.<br/>"Ranma-kun, there is a nice lady here to see you. She's outside." Kasumi said sweetly as Mousse, Tifa, and Akane stared curiously at Ranma's suddenly tense form.<p>Ranma ran out of the house onto the front porch and everyone followed. What they saw there surprised them to no end. A green-haired scantily clad woman stood proud in front of the Tendo frontyard, a light green aura surrounding her. Genma and Soun held the 4 children to the side afraid. Ranma stood in front of the woman tense and ready as Mousse, Kasumi, Tifa and Akane stood behind him a good distance away. Everyone could see the dangerous dark blue aura surrounding Ranma.<p>"What are you doing here, Shou Yung?" Ranma growled out.<br/>The woman narrowed her eyes at Ranma and said as if pronouncing a proclamation, "You have failed to find Mu Tsu and bring him back with Cay Xi within the two year limit, Ran Mae. I am here, by word of the honored Elders, to take Kol One's heir home."<br/>Ranma said also as if he recited a proclamation, "I have found Mu Tsu, Shou Yung..." Ranma pointed to Mousse, "...but Mu Tsu has his own family now. He has a wife and two sons, he can not afford to gain another son. So I ask the Elders once again to allow me to keep Cay Xi and teach him the ways of the modern world."<p>Shou Yung growled menacingly and shouted, "Never! Cay Xi was born and Amazon and he shall die an Amazon. The Honored Elders will be disappointed to know Mu Tsu has married such a weakling, but that was unavoided and expected of him. You may do as you wish Ran Mae for the Amazon's claim on you is broken, we will miss you and hope that you come to the Amazons aid if the tribe needed help. Cay Xi, however, I am expected to take back to the tribe, you may come if you want, we will be happy to have you, but do not hold onto Kol One's heir, or your death will be certain!"<br/>Everyone around Ranma gasped at this woman's dangerous no-questioning tone, but Belldandy ran from Genma's arm to stand in front of the woman.<br/>"Bell, no!" Akane yelled but Belldandy held no heed to her mother's words.<p>"No! You will not take Keichii away!" Belldandy said definitly before Shou Yung blasted a green chi blast at the small girl. Belldandy's eyes held fear, but she did not move from where she stood for it was too late. The blast hit Belldandy square in the chest and she flew towards a nearby tree slumping on it and coughing up blood as she laid uncouncious. Akane ran to her daughter's side and hugged her close as she stared eyes filled with hatred towards the woman, her blue aura flaring. Ranma saw this, but before he could stop her Akane had already ran towards the woman, her mind only on hurting the person that had hurt Belldandy.<p>The woman looked bored at Akane and another green blast came fom her and blasted Akane uncouncious and spitting blood next to Belldandy. Ranma stared at Akane's flying form and turned his hate-filled eyes toward Shou Yung. A red dragon emitted dangerously from his outstretched hands and raced towards Shou Yung. Shou Yung dared not move for there was no dodging this attack. The chi dragon passed it's way through Shou Yung and she felt as if fire burned her insides to ashes. When the dragon dispassitated, Shou Yung fell back blood shooting from her mouth.<p>"Do you think the Elders would be proud that you had attacked a helpless female child, Shou Yung?" yelled Ranma.<br/>"Agh...no...agh...but they will...agh...be proud that I...agh...did any means possible to gain back Kol One's heir," Shou Yung coughed.<br/>"Kol One's heir, Kol One's heir, do you not care who you hurt to gain Kol One's heir?" asked Ranma incredulously.<br/>"Yes,...but it is not a matter of what I think, but of what is best for the tribe...and my life is for the tribe," Shou Yung whispered before bounding off.<p>Ranma stared at her disappearing form a minute contemplating if he should follow her until he heard a moan behind him. Ranma ran next to Akane and picked her up in his arms as he bounded off onto the rooftops heading towards Dr. Tofu's clinic.<br/>Mousse stared after him a minute before picking up Belldandy and carrying her after Ranma.<p>Ranma ran into the clinic obviously forgetting what a door was and creating a new hole in the clinic's wall. Dr. Tofu ran from his office where he was researching to see Ranma holding a bloody Akane in his arms.<br/>"Ranma, wha-?" Dr. Tofu said before Mousse ran into the clinic holding a bloody Belldandy.<p>Dr. Tofu gestured toward Ranma and Mousse to lay Akane and Belldandy side-by-side on the small clinic bed.<br/>"What happened?" Dr. Tofu asked as he tended to Akane and Belldandy checking them for any serious wounds.<br/>Seeing that Ranma wasn't going to say anything as he sat beside Akane Mousse spoke up, "I don't know, but this Amazon I knew, Shou Yung came looking for Ranma saying something about wanting to take someone named Cay Xi back with the Amazons. She also said something about Ranma failing to find me." Dr. Tofu could tell that Mousse was more confused about this whole situation then he was so he kept back his other questions.<p>"Are they going to be okay, Tofu Sensei?" Ranma asked softly. He knew he was beyond worried for Akane, that was natural, but deep in his gut he was also terrified that something would happen to Belldandy. As if it was pure human instinct that he was afraid for Belldandy also. *Why...?* he wondered. After all Belldandy was Akane's and some other man's daughter. Why should he care for her at all, but something in the deep corner of his heart and soul told him otherwise. Ranma didn't know why, but he came to love the spunky little daughter of Akane's and something kept nagging at him ever since he first saw her. As if there was something about her that his already scrambled mind refused to process.<p>Dr. Tofu looked at Ranma intently for a minute as if he was trying to figure out a puzzle and said slowly, "Yes, Akane is fine, she's strong...but I have to do a bloodtest on Belldandy to see if that chi blast didn't do any harm or disturbance towards her chi." Ranma just nodded absently as he continued to hold onto Akane's hand. Dr. Tofu took a little blood from Belldandy and put it on a rack filled with blood-tubes that read: DNA test.<p>"Why isn't she awake yet?" Ranma asked accusingly.<br/>"Akane and Belldandy lost some blood and their body is recuperating to gain back it's lost energy although they will be in a weak state when they wake up," Dr. Tofu explained.<br/>Ranma just continued looking worridly at Akane and sometimes at Belldandy *Wake up...please Akane...wake up...If I ever see you again, Shou Yung... you better hope that I have enough pity not to tear your body apart...*<p>Soon, Kasumi, Tifa, Genma, Soun, Nadoka, Ukyo, Shiro, Ryoga, Akira, Ryoko, Keichii, Con Di, Xion Er, Nabiki, and Kuno arrived. Obviously, Genma and Soun told everyone what happened. Ranma paid them no heed.<br/>"Who's Cay Xi?" Mousse asked.<br/>Everyone looked at the little black haired rat-tailed little boy beside Belldandy's sleeping form. Mousse looked at the little boy and tried to understand the obvious answer his heart tried to tell him. His mind kept the wall between him and the revelation strong and high however.<p>"I'm sorry, Bell-chan. I didn't know that Shou Yung would be angry at me," the little boy whispered guiltly as everyone tried convincing him it wasn't his fault.<br/>Soon, Akane stirred and groggily got up. Ranma's face glowed with joy and hope as he looked at her.<br/>"Akane, you okay?" he asked. Akane just looked at him a moment before her face contorted in fear. "Belldandy?" she whispered frightened until she saw the sleeping form of her daughter next to her.<p>"Now, can you tell us what the heck happened?" Mousse said angrily at Ranma.<br/>Ranma looked nervously at Akane before turning a blank stare to Mousse and everyone.<br/>Ranma took Keichii and held him gently in front of himself as he said, "Everyone, I would like you to meet, Cay Xi, Kol One's heir, Shan Pu's child, and...Mu Tsu's son."<br/>"What?" everyone screamed including an awestruck Mousse who just had his wall broken and the secret revealed to him. Mousse then turned his attention away from everyone but the little boy in front of him. Keichii looked questioningly at Ranma and saw his dad's eyes glowed warmly as he nodded in the affirmative.<p>Keichii turned his shy gaze towards Mousse's outright staring one and he puffed his chest proudly.<br/>"Hello, father Mu Tsu. Now you die," Keichii said tonelessly as if he repeated someone else's words.<p>Author's Notes: How's that for a cliffhanger. Don't worry, I'm not mean, the next chapter should come out easily. All comments and criticism to silverflame_.<p>
