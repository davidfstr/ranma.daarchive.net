</div>Forever Bound<br/>Chapter 14, For What Truths We Hold Dear<p>Author's Notes: Okay, next chapter. This one will just clarify what some of you already know before or after reading the sidestory to Chapter 11. It may just make some of you out there hate Ranko more, but don't worry, the girl has a heart, it's just not in the right place, its'all. Oh yeah, just to clarify things a little bit, after the everyone foragev him, Ranma and Keichii moved back in with the  send all comments and criticism to silverflame_.<p>Disclaimers: I do not own Ranma 1/2, Rumiko Takahashi does. Little Women is a novel by Louisa May Alcott. {Amazing novel} Ah! My Goddess! was created by whoever made them.<p>Akane groaned at the unmerciless glare of the bright hospital lights. She suddenly felt the scorching of her skins on her arms and legs. Akane sat up slowly to ease the pain and saw Ranma beside her bed asleep with that content look on his face so rarely there. Akane really didn't want to wake him up and decided to just allow him to rest awhile, that is until she saw the door creak open a little. Akane looked up to see Belldandy's small form walk in holding a glass of water in her hands. Belldandy smiled when she noticed her mother had woken up, she walked quietly over, put the glass of water on the table and went to sit on the bed next to her mother.<p>"Hey sweety," Akane said, her voice still dry, "what happened?"<br/>Belldandy seemed to think about this for a moment as if trying to decide whether or not she should tell her mother and decided on the former, "There was a fire in your room, Mommy. The police people said that it had something to do with that plug...thingy...um..."<br/>"Power outlet," Akane suggested.<br/>Belldandy smiled, her confusion gone, "Yeah! Grampa, Auntie 'sumie, and everyone else don't think it's that though. It's cause the fire only burned in your room and it should have...k-k-k-..."<br/>"Killed me?" Akane put in quietly.<p>Belldandy nodded and said quietly, "Yeah, they said that for as long as the fire burned, it shoulda killed you already, but it didn't, sorta like someone controlled it." Belldandy hugged Akane tighter and she looked down and scowled at Ranma.<br/>"Uncie Ranma know something though. He was really mad, but he won't tell us anything and it's not fair. Make him tell who did it Mommy," Belldandy whined helplessly.<p>Akane just shook her head and said into her daughter's honey hair, "Bell, I need a talk with Ranma. Can you do Mommy a favor and go get Mommy some ice for her throat?"<br/>Belldandy just nodded and bounded off the bed as Akane sighed and pushed Ranma awake.<p>"Huh? Akane? Akane? Oh, hey, you're awake, you o.k?" Ranma asked for once waking up from a light sleep.<br/>Akane scowled at him and said more harsh then she meant, "Before I answer any of your questions, Ranma Saotome, mind telling me exactly why a fire just happened to burn only in my room and yet after all this time, I am still alive?" Ranma laughed nervously and scratched the back of his head as he said in his old form of speech, "Heh...heh...I don't know what'chu talkin' 'bout, Akane. The cops just said it was an outlet problem that's all, see? Nothing to worry your pretty little head over." Ranma flinched at his unconvincing speech and especially at the "...pretty little head...". *Man, that has got to be the most stupidest thing I have ever heard, oh she won't wowwy her pweety witty hwead at all* his mind mocked him. *Shut up! I was desperate for ideas...wait I'm arguing with my brain, I have got to solve this problem before I go visit Kodachi*<p>Akane narrowed her eyes at Ranma and said sarcastically, "Oh I won't worry my pretty little head at all, Ranma. After all, I have a wonderful, macho, egotistical, knight in shining armour to do it for me!"<br/>Ranma just thanked whoever was up there for the wonderful change in subject(although it could have been better, but hey, beggers can't be choosers), "Oh you wouldn't need a knight in shinning armour at all Akane. After all, being uncute and an over-masculine tomboy does have it's advantages."<p>Akane tried to keep her smile down at the old-time teasing and said, "Great coming from a perverted jerk who couldn't keep his hands off anything on two legs!"<br/>Ranma laughed, "Oh really, don't be a hyprocrite Akane, last I remembered you couldn't keep your hands off of me!" Akane abruptly stopped laughing and Ranma did too once he realized what he said. Ranma clamped his hands tightly over his mouth. Akane bit hard onto her lip drawing up a slight of blood on her dry lips, her eyes once again steamed with tears. That seemed to happen a lot lately now, her heart breaking and her eyes burning from tears.<p>Ranma noticed Akane's slumped form and whispered, "Oh, Akane, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that, it just slipped out."<br/>Akane turned her round, captivating brown eyes at Ranma and he felt the guilt killing him from inside. Guilt, that was a funny thing, he seemed to feel that more around Akane. Guilt, and anger, and disappointment...though all of that was better then the pain which ironically, he felt most of all.<br/>"You seem to be doing that a lot nowadays, Ranma," Akane whispered sadly.<br/>Ranma blinked for a second afraid that those breathtaking eyes of her did more then just captivate...but saw through him as he always feared.<p>"What?" squeaked Ranma which would have sounded funny on the Martial Artist if not for the current situation.<br/>Akane gave him a smile, albeit an empty one, "Apologizing."<br/>"You don't want me to say I'm sorry?" asked Ranma increduously since that was what most people asked of him, but he stedfastly refused of them.<br/>Akane shook her head and said, "No, I don't want you to do anything that you would have to apologize for."<p>Ranma stayed silent, so did Akane. After awhile to break the although not uncomftorble, still unfamiliar silence Akane said more cheerfully, "Man, I'm bored. Is there anything to do?"<br/>Ranma fidgeted and pulled out a thick book, "Nabiki said that to have t.v in your room would simply be too expensive to waste on only a few days here so she bought you this gaijin book instead."<br/>Akane looked at the thick book, she knew how to read American, over 6 years in France and around the world perfected that. The book read: Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The book obviously wasn't about Martial Arts since the front cover had the picture of 4 girls on the front, in front of a fire.<p>"This isn't about Martial Arts, is it?" Akane asked Ranma simply.<br/>Ranma fidgeted, "No..."<br/>"And it has nothing to do with acting, does it?" asked Akane.<br/>Ranma started moving around in his chair uncomftorably, "No..."<br/>"And it deals with nothing in any similarity towards motherhood, sisterhood, daughterhood, demons, god-like entities, amazons, curses, or anything of the sort? It probably doesn't even take place in Japan," Akane smiled enjoying this more and more.<p>Ranma sighed, "Listen, Akane, I have no idea whatsoever why Nabiki would get you a boring book like that, but right now, it's your only entertainment so enjoy it."<br/>Akane laughed, "Oh and here I was enjoying your ignorance and stupidity so much more." Ranma scowled darkly at Akane causing Akane to click her teeth and sigh, "Aw, come on, Ranma, it was a joke, I was only kidding. Don't take everything so serious."<br/>Ranma burst out laughing causing Akane to ask why.<p>"Oh, it was just that I never thought you would say it to me instead of the other way around," Ranma choked out. Akane scowled playfully at him and said, "Get out of here before I hit you for opening your oversized mouth. After all, I have to start reading this...um...er...book Nabiki gave me or she might charge me for wasting her money. Ranma left the room laughing as Akane settled down to begin the novel Nabiki gave her.<p>(Outside Akane's room, Moments after Belldandy left)<br/>Belldandy stood outside the hospital room door ready to head to the nurse's office down the hall for some ice when she felt something deep inside her. Belldandy tried ignoring the feeling and keep going until she heard someone whisper to her behind the door to her left. Belldandy walked into the room only to have the door close behind her. Inside stood a beautiful red-haired lady.<p>"Hello, Belldandy, is it?" the lady drolled out. Now, Belldandy wasn't a child that was easily frightened considering her background and family history, but after all she was only a 6-year old child and this lady could have frightened a living anaconda out of it's scales if she wanted.<br/>"M-my Mommy said not to talk to wierd looking people that I don't know," Belldandy managed to get out without much of a stammer.<p>Ranko grabbed Belldandy's small shoulders to keep her from going out the door, her long red nails digging slightly into the child's back. "Oh, your Mommy told you not to talk to wierd people, huh, brat? Guess what, your Mommy is a whore and a liar so I wouldn't believe everything that Mommy said if I were you!" Ranko sneered. Now, Ranko should have stopped when she was ahead for she had the child frightened...right until she insulted her mother.<p>Belldandy tried unsuccessfully to get out of Ranko's grip to fail and so she settled by kicking Ranko in the stomach, hard and yell, "Don't you say that! Your more mean then my Mommy is and Mommy isn't a whore or a liar so shut up! Mommy dresses more dec-dece- more nicer then you, so there!"<br/>Ranko swore loudly, but didn't let Belldandy go and she turned her furious firery gaze at the small girl. Belldandy screamed as the whole room seemed to erupt into fire.<p>"So, brat, if your precious honorable mother is so *nice* then who is your father? Ever ask her? What did she say? Your probably a bastard like your little friend, Keichii, only at least his parents loved each other!" Ranko yelled. Belldandy felt the tears running down her cheek, but like many members of her family she chose to ignore them. *My father? He was...he is...Mommy said...she just said he was...gone...* Belldandy thought as she cried.<br/>Suddenly, the fire was gone and Belldandy opened her eyes to see a nice tall bronze, platinum-hair, beautiful lady stand in front of Ranko.<p>The lady spoke, "Let her go, Ranko."<br/>Ranko sneered, "Oh and your going to stop me, Urd? Ha! I am just having my justice and you only being a goddess, 3rd class, you can't really stop me now can you?"<br/>Urd smiled, "Ah, I remember that little...um...thrift we had because of that...human...but this is far more important and I won't lose."<br/>"You can't stop me, I am only killing another human," Ranko sneered confidently.<p>"Ah! How quick you memory forgets, Ranko, my dear. That is my sister you hold so close and wish to kill so badly...let me refresh your memory for you..." And so, Ranko remembered what she had forgotten.<br/>########Memory, 1500 years before#######<br/>Marshidi pushed, breathing hard. Larchlarn held onto Marshidi's hand trying his best to comfort his wife and at the same time prevent his hand from breaking.<br/>"Breathe, honey, just breathe," Larchlarn said with extra breathing for emphasis.<br/>"Don't you dare tell me to breathe, you did this to me!" Marshidi yelled as a silver bolt flashed from her hands to hit an iron, crystal, magic, unbreakable wall...it turned the wall to dust. Larchlarn gulped, hoping his wife's next target would not be him.<p>"Breathe, only one more time," the woman "doctor" said soothingly.<br/>Marshidi gave one final scream and her dark blue hair turned platinum silver and her skin turned a dark bronze along with her eyes that transformed from it's captivating brown to a sultry silverish hazel, showing her true from as a desert blossom sprite. Marshidi would have prefered giving birth to her first child in her human form, but she wasn't complaining. A baby's cry was heard and the "doctor" handed the baby girl to Marshidi to hold.<p>Marshidi stared deeply into the baby's beautiful eyes and whispered with Larchlarn standing next to her, "Hello, Urd, this is your life and I'm your mommy. Welcome."<br/>#######End of Memory#######<p>######Memory, 1500 years before#########<br/>Urd ran through the woods, her platinum hair flying wildly over her bronze skin and animal-skin short skirt and top. Urd ran shouting into her father's arms and laughed as Larchlarn tickled her. Larchlarn carried his daughter towards the cave and next to the fire his wife built. Marshidi sat by the fire smiling wistfully.<p>Urd jumped from her father's arms and ran smack into her mother who fell back laughing.<br/>"Why hello, Urddy," Marshidi laughed as Urd scowled.<br/>Urd growled, "I don't know why you and daddy keep callin' me that that."<br/>Larchlarn joined in Marshidi's laughter, "Well, how are we supposed to make a nickname out of Urd?"<p>Urd just turned her cute scowl at her father who broke into another peal of laughter. Marshidi finally got up and held her young daughter to her arms saying softly, "Urd, do you want a sister?" The little child's eyebrows knit in confusion, "What's a sister?"<p>Marshidi said softly, "Well she's sort of like a related best friend. You'll get in fights, but you'll have someone to help me take care of. You'll be someone's big sister and they'll look up to you."<br/>Urd smiled, "I want a sister, Mommy, where is it?"<br/>Akane smiled, "She is right here, sweety, in my stomach. Just like you were once." Urd just smiled brighter and took her small hand to touch her mother's growing stomach, "Sister, hurry up and come out, you don't want to keep me waiting, do you?"<br/>########End of Flashback##########<br/>Ranko got out of her daze to see Urd stand there stiffly, cold hatred in her eyes. Urd finally spoke, "You had ruined my life once *Auntie Grenada*. You took my family from me, my parents, my sister. Why didn't you just kill me along with them, Ranko, so that I could be born again with them instead of having to live alone for 1500 years? Do you hate me that much Ranko?" Urd was screaming by the time she finished, something she rarely ever do.<p>Ranko stood her ground though a knawing guilt chewed at her at what her past life had done. Too bad it made her love Ranma in this life though...too too bad.<br/>"Sorry, my dear Urd. I'm going to kill this poor excuse of a goddess here and now," Ranko said cooly.<br/>Urd just shook her head, "No, your not." Suddenly, a portal opened from under Ranko and sucked her in leaving a momentary peace. Belldandy stared wide-eyed at the lady in front of her.<p>"Hi, Belldandy," Urd said hesitently.<br/>Belldandy smiled a brilliant smile at the lady, "Thanks for saving me, though I could have done it myself." Urd just laughed.<br/>Belldandy suddenly got her mind working again and one thing she noticed was, "Urd, if your my sister, right?" Urd nodded, "...and your a goddess..." Urd nodded again, "...then wouldn't your father be..." Urd smiled and said, "I was refering to our birth father and mother."<p>Belldandy just shook her head at the confusion. "Are you going now, Urd oneechan?" Urd grinned at the affactionate tone and words, but said sadly, "I have to..."<br/>"Can I tell, Mommy about you?" Belldandy asked. "No, you must not tell anyone about me!" Urd said urgently. Belldandy nodded.<p>Before Urd could disappear however Belldandy asked, "Urd, who's our birthfather?" Urd just laughed and disappeared and the wind whispered in Belldandy's ear, "Ask Mommy..."<p>So Belldandy left the small hospital broom closet that day knwoing more then any child should know. If any child had been threatened and nearly killed by a fire goddess, they would have fainted. If any child learned that she had a sister who was a goddess, they would have been disbelieving. If any child found out that she was a goddess, they would have bragged it to the whole world. Then, again Belldandy wasn't any child so she walked from that broom closet that day with nothing more to tell then that she had gotten lost inside that closet. This was Nerima, after all, what did you expect? A child going to get ice for her mother and nothing interesting happening. Ha! Not a chance! Especially if that child is Ranma Saotome's daughter. Oops, guess I shouldn't have told you that.<p>Author's Notes: Was that unexpected or what?<p>
