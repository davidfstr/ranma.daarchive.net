</div><p><b>The Fire  Sutra  - A Ranma 1/2 Fanfic  </b>By Ashoka Roque<br/>Book 3 of "Ashoro's Ranma Sutras"</p><p>Warnings and disclaimers - see Chapter One.</p><p>C &amp; C  appreciated</p><p><b>Chapter  Five: Midnight Conference</b></p><p>Kasumi  outdid all expectations for dinner that evening. It was a feast of noodles,  rice and perfectly prepared tilapia, bought special and fresh from the market  that morning. Even better, a roast duck, served with delicately slivered  almonds.</p><p>"I just  knew you girls would win!" Kasumi beamed, as she watched the crew devour  her cooking appreciatively.</p><p>Though a  heart-felt celebration, everyone agreed to turn in early.  Ti Xiu was the first to extend his  apologies, leaving shortly after dinner on another mysterious errand. Before  too long, most of the Tendo household was in bed, the majority of them sleeping  after a day of good games and good food.</p><p>There were a  few exceptions, of course.  Ranma got  out of bed as soon as he was sure his father was fast asleep, and made his way  down to the kitchen.</p><p><i>I need to do  something about Ryouga,</i> he  thought, as he moved silently down the stairs, <i>and at this point, I can only  think of one thing that might resolve this. </i> Gliding towards Kasumi's cutting board, he picked up the large  knife used to decapitate and carve the evening's duck.  He then silently headed out the door, moving  towards Ryouga's tent.</p><p><i>Oh, no!</i> thought Akane.  Returning from the washroom, she had felt more than heard Ranma's  movements towards the kitchen.  Thinking  this would be the perfect time for a serious, private discussion, she had  followed him down the stairs, only to see him pick up the knife and move to the  door.</p><p><i>I have to  stop him, but I need a plan, and fast!</i>  Rushing as quietly and as  quickly as she could, Akane went to the one person who could help.</p><p>"Nabiki!  Nabiki!" Akane whispered loudly in her sister's ear.</p><p>"Uh..  Akane.. what is it?" Nabiki rolled over, sleepily.</p><p>"Ranma's  heading out to Ryouga-kun's tent with a knife.   I overheard them arguing about me today.  I think baka Ranma is going to kill Ryouga-kun!"</p><p>Nabii opened  one eye, lazily. "Uh...Akane-chan.   I think it is <b>highly</b> unlikely that Ranma-kun is going to kill  Ryouga-kun."</p><p>"Then  why is Ranma sneaking out to Ryouga-kun's tent in the middle of the  night?"</p><p>Nabiki sat  up, a look of resignation on her sleepy face. "You really aren't going to  believe anything you don't see with your own eyes, are you? C'mon. Let's go  down and sort this mess out."</p><p>Outside,  Ranma quietly approached Ryouga's tent. The lost boy had lit a small fire in a  ring of stones in front of his portable home, perhaps to dispel some of the night  chill. Ranma slowly lifted the tent flap, and crouched down to crawl inside.</p><p>"Still  awake, Ryouga-kun?"</p><p>"Of  course," said Ryouga, his voice betraying him.  He had obviously dozed off, only to awaken at Ranma's entry.  "Just keeping the bedroll warm for you."</p><p>"Ryouga,  I think we need to talk."</p><p>"I'm  listening."</p><p>Ranma sat on  the bedroll next to his friend. "I know that...our relationship...is a new  experience, for both of us."</p><p>"Go  on," said Ryouga, tilting his head slightly as he listened.</p><p>"And I  know that you have not always had a good reason to trust me in the past, so  maybe I deserved some of your comments today."</p><p>Ryouga sat  silently.</p><p>"Anyway,"  continued Ranma, "I don't know how to convince you that you have no reason  to be jealous - of Mu Suu, or Daisuke, or Akane, or anybody.  I could only think of one way to show  you."  Ranma pulled out the large  kitchen knife from his waistband.</p><p>"Ranma!"  said Ryouga, sitting up straight, "What are you talking about?"</p><p>Turning the  knife over handle first, and grabbing it by the blade, Ranma held it out  towards his koibito. "Ryouga, I want you to cut off my pigtail with this  knife."</p><p>Ryouga sat,  stunned, then shook his head, "No way - you've been growing that for  years. It's a sign of your dedication to your training. Besides, why would you  want me to do that?"</p><p>"Because  it's my fault we fought, and you had to get your hair cut off."</p><p>Ryouga ran  his hand over his head self-consciously, taking in the bristly feeling.  "What does that have to do with  anything?"</p><p>"Because  I need to be responsible for what I do. Ti-sensei made me realize that my  training won't be complete until I've learned to consider how my actions affect  other people. It's like a duty, but one that can offer freedom as well as  responsibility. And because I can't think of any other way to prove to you that  I want only you. It's just a symbol, but I really mean it."</p><p>Ryouga  reluctantly took the knife as Ranma bowed his head.  He placed the flat of the blade against the back of his friend's  neck, the sharp edge resting just at the hairline. Ryouga felt Ranma's  shoulders tense<i>.  I know this won't  hurt,</i> thought Ranma, <i>So why do I feel so anxious? It's only hair, after  all. It's nothing compared to the heart of someone special.</i></p><p>Ryouga  prepared to cut, the muscles in his arms flexing slightly. "I can't do  it."</p><p>Ranam raised  his eyebrows, trying to look up at Ryouga without moving his neck. "Just  do it! Ti-sensi would call it equaling our karmic debt."</p><p>"I  don't care," said Ryouga, tossing the knife out the door of the tent, then  bending to grasp Ranma in his arms. "I don't care about my hair, either. I  just pretend I do because I know it bothers you. I'm no better than Xian Pu  making cat noises to get to you. I just want to know you'll really be there for  me - that you won't run off with someone else - that I won't be alone  again."</p><p>Ranma looked  his partner in the eyes, seeing the pain just barely visible in their depths.  "Please, please believe me.  I  won't leave you alone, or lost, ever." Ranma gently pressed his lips against  Ryouga's mouth, then pushed the other boy back down against the bedroll.  Fumbling hands quickly loosened clothing, then the same hands began to explore  the bare flesh underneath.</p><p>Outside the  tent, two Tendo daughters were crouched in the bushes.  They had heard every word through the thin  nylon walls.</p><p>"See,"  said Nabiki, yawning. "I told you he wasn't going to stick that knife into  Ryouga. Something else, perhaps..."</p><p>"Oh,  just shut up, Nabiki!" hissed Akane, feeling relieved, embarrassed and  puzzled all at the same time. And was that even a hint of jealousy gnawing at  the edge of her mind?  <i>How could I  have been so totally wrong? Why didn't I see this?  What *else* have I been missing? And how could this happen - they  have such strong feelings for each other! </i>Akane blushed in the darkness. <i>And  that strikes just a little too close to home. I don't even know why I have the  feelings I sometimes have.  </i>Akane  remembered walking arm-in-arm with Ukyo that afternoon, and the little smudge  of dirt on the very tip of her friend's nose. <i>Why are these things happening  to us? Why can't we just like each other, and satisfy our family duty?</i></p><p>Akane stared  into the fire, burning gently in front of Ryouga's tent.  <i>I guess Ti Sensi was right, as  usual.  I can ask why that fire is  burning, or I can just accept that it is. Do I really worry too much, and let  my questions be a barrier, and an excuse to not do anything?</i></p><p>"Akane-chan,"  said Nabiki, placing her hand on her sister's shoulder. "Let's go  inside."  Her voice was uncharacteristically  gentle. "I may have an idea, if you want to listen."</p><p>"Nabiki-chan, I think I would like  that."</p><p>As they  walked back to the house, neither girl mentioned money changing hands.</p><p>Quite a bit later,  Ranma and Ryouga crept into the Tendo kitchen. The last couple of hours had  been taxing enough to put a dent in Kasumi's giant supper, so a quick snack of  leftover duck was sounding pretty good. As Ranma opened the refrigerator door,  the icebox light raced across the dark kitchen to illuminate Akane and Nabiki,  sitting side-by-side at the table.</p><p>"About  time you showed up," said Akane, calmly sipped a cup of tea. "I  thought we were going to be here all night."</p><p>Both boys  froze in the beam of light, like two woodland animals who had foolishly chosen  to cross the road in front of a speeding semi truck.</p><p>"Ranma-san,  please, sit down," said Akane, gesturing with her hand. "The leftover  duck is here, as well as some warm tea. Ryouga-san, I was hoping you would join  us as well. Sit, please."</p><p>"Uh,  gee, Akane," said Ranma, raising his right hand to scratch the back of his  head, "We were just finishing some late night training, and I thought  Ryouga-kun might like a snack before turning in."</p><p>"Yes!"  agreed Ryouga, nodding his head emphatically, "This is indeed what we are  doing, Akane-san."</p><p>"Ranma-san,  Ryouga-san, it's late," said Akane, a little wearily. "Please sit  down so we can talk and get to bed.  My  advisor needs her beauty sleep."</p><p>Nabiki  opened her droopy eyes a little wider. "That wasn't called for,  Akane-chan."  Akane ignored her, as  she lit a couple of candles. A soft glow spread over the table.</p><p>"Boy,  Akane," said Ranma, sitting down reluctantly, sweat-drops forming on the  back of his head, "Why the formality? You're so business-like..."</p><p>"Because,  Ranma-sama," said Nabiki, more fully alert, "we are going to talk  business. Acting <i>in loco parentis</i> in place of our dear, departed mother,  I am revising this wedding agreement. Akane-chan felt this was better than  involving our father, given the circumstances. As this arranged marriage is  primarily economically motivated, it falls within my family duties."</p><p>Akane nodded  quietly, sipping her tea.</p><p>"I am  going to ask you some questions, Ranam-sama," continued Nabiki in a  serious tone, "and I want some answers."</p><p>Ranma  gulped. It was very rare for him to encounter a rational, respectable adult.  Even if this was just Tendo Nabiki, she was actually a very real surrogate  mother for Akane in this situation. In the face of this development, centuries  of cultural conditioning gave him little choice.</p><p>"Ah...okay,  Nabiki-san. I will answer if I can."</p><p>"Domo.  First, you need to know that Akane and I are fully aware of the nature of your  late-night 'training' with Ryouga-sama."</p><p>Both boys'  faces turned red in the dim candlelight, and Ryouga opened his mouth in  protest, only to be stopped by Nabiki's raised hand.</p><p>"AND...if  I may continue...we are actually quite happy for both of you."</p><p>Ranma sat in  shock.  Of all the reactions, this was  the last one he would have predicted.</p><p>"Akane  in particular feels that you two jerks deserve each other," continued  Nabiki, ignoring Ranma's frozen stare, "and I couldn't agree more.  However, you do realize this complicates the original marriage plans?  Do both of you feel you have the potential  for a permanent relationship?"</p><p>Ranma was  still speechless, so it was Ryouga who answered Nabiki.  "I, Hibiki Ryouga, never intend to  leave Ranma-kun's side." He reached under the table to covertly squeeze  Ranma's hand.</p><p>"Noble,"  said Nabiki, nodding her head in agreement. "I am counting on your full  cooperation, Ryouga-sama."</p><p>"Because,"  said Akane, setting her teacup gently on the table, "we will be getting  married, Ranma-san."  Nabiki had  laid the whole plan out for her as they waited for Ranma to sneak back into the  house.  Though somewhat unorthodox,  Nabiki's solution elegantly echoed some of Ti-sensei's advice from the Fire  Sutra.  Rather than worrying about why  they were in the situation they were in, Akane saw Nabiki's plan as thoughtful  and oddly compassionate.  And it didn't  hurt that it might help resolve some of the complications she foresaw in her  own life.</p><p>"And  it's a package deal, boys," continued Nabiki. "TWO talented martial  artists tied to this dojo will ensure the Tendo family's security into the next  generation, making me happy. You two stay together, making you happy.  Ranma-sama and Akane-chan get married, satisfying the family honor and making  our fathers happy. This has the added benefit of sheltering the two of you from  any negative fallout from your relationship. Everyone is discrete, and  business-like."</p><p>"But,"  protested Ranma, "What if Akane-chan falls in love someday? She would be  tied to me..."</p><p>Nabiki  turned to her sister with a knowing smile. "Akane-chan has assured me that  this arrangement is entirely to her liking, fully realizing the public  commitment the wedding will carry.  She  has stated that, even if she does fall in love, she will do nothing to shame  the honor of this family or cause her spouse to lose face." Nabiki now  turned her gaze to Ranma, setting steel in her voice. "I trust you will do  the same, Ranma-sama."</p><p>"But  does Ryouga-san agree?" asked Akane, as all eyes turned to Hibiki, bandana  tied loosely around his centimeter-long crew cut.</p><p>"Ryo-chan,"  said Ranma, "Don't think of this as taking me away from you.  It's actually a duty that frees us to be  together."</p><p>The  atmosphere around the table was tense for the next few moments.  The golden glow of the candles flickered  across the faces of the four young people, for once all equally intent and  serious. "I don't suppose I have much of a choice," responded Ryouga,  sullenly.</p><p>"Splendid,"  declared Nabiki, getting up from the table. "We can iron out the details over  the next few days. Now, I do need my sleep.   I was up late last night, too. Which reminds me..." Nabiki reached  behind her back, then slid a plain manila envelope across the table.  "Consider this an early wedding present."</p><p>"What  is it?" asked Ranma, picking up the envelope and undoing the string that  held it closed.</p><p>"Just  pictures of last night's 'training' session.   I've had an ultra-low-light telephoto lens for my Nikon since I was ten  years old.  I have some connections in  Hong Kong who could have translated those snaps into quite a bundle, but since  you're both joining the family, I guess I need to look for another way to pay  for Christmas this year."</p><p>"I TOLD  you we should have stayed inside the tent!" howled Ryouga, grabbing  several pictures from Ranma's hand.</p><p>"But it  was so cramped in there..." protested Ranma, indignantly.</p><p>"My,  Ryouga-kun," commented Akane, peering over Ranma's shoulder at one of the  incriminating photographs, "That's quite the tight little butt. All that  walking around aimlessly sure has done wonders for your physique."</p><p>"Which  reminds me," said Nabiki, yawning as she and her sister left the two  blushing boys behind in the kitchen and made their way up to bed, "I  really must start working out if I'm going to fit into that bridesmaid  dress..."</p><p><i>Epilogue</i></p><p>As events  were unfolding that night at the Tendo dojo, seated around a similar table and  drinking similar cups of tea, Ti Xiu was concluding a long discussion with Xian  Pu's great-grandmother, Kho Lohn,  The  two elders had a relaxed manner with each other - one that indicated life-long  acquaintance and mutual respect.</p><p>"So,  Ti, you say someone has been gathering chuang flower from the mountains?"</p><p>"Yes,  Kho," said Ti Xiu, raising his cup to his lips for another sip of  tea.  "And in large numbers.  One whole valley was almost stripped  clean."</p><p>Kho Lohn  shook her aged head in bewilderment. "Who in the world would be foolish  enough to do such a thing?"</p><p>"Foolish  is the key word, of course," replied Ti Xiu. "And the last report I  received from Nepal indicates they are being shipped to Japan - we're just not  sure where."</p><p>"Do  these people know how dangerous those flowers are?" Kho Lohn stood up from  the table and began to walk around the kitchen, agitated. "An incident  could make the Aum Shinrikyo tragedy in Tokyo look like a walk in the  park."</p><p>"That's  why I need to do two things as soon as humanly possible," replied Ti Xiu.  "I need to find where those flowers are going, and I need to identify the  antidote.  That's why I came to  you."</p><p>"Well,"  said Kho Lohn, "There is an antidote.   It's a plant extract, but the plant only grows on Mindanao."</p><p>"Then  I'm off to Mindanao in the morning - I'll be able to get there faster than you  could. The monastery's resources will help me secure the antidote, and get it  here quickly. May I impose on you to review my notes. Perhaps you can figure  out what anyone could possibly be planning to do with chuang flower."</p><p>"Certainly,  Father Ti," said Kho Lohn. "We can exchange notes in the morning  before you leave."</p><p>"May  Buddha smile," replied Ti Xiu, thankfully. "And I probably should  have a chat with you about the young people around here before I  leave."  The two elders walked out  of the kitchen slowly, heads held together conspiratorially.  "If there was ever a group that needed  the sage advice and guidance of their elders..."</p><p>END</p><p>This Ranam  Fanfic series will continues in "The Lotus Sutra"</p><p>C &amp; C  appreciated</p>
