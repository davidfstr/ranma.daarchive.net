</div><p><b>The Fire  Sutra  - A Ranma 1/2 Fanfic<br/></b>By Ashoka Roque<br/>Book 3 of "Ashoro's Ranma Sutras"</p><p>Warnings: PG for adult humor and situations. Yaoi pairing  (Ranma/Ryouga) : If anyone is offended by the stereotyped characterizations in  the softball game, my apologies.  It's  meant to be light-hearted, not social commentary. I have good friends who play  softball, and it made them laugh, so it passed the test in my book.</p><p>Disclaimer: The "Ranma 1/2" characters belong to  Takahashi Rumiko. I have put them in situations that diverge from the original  storyline, but with no intent of compromising the integrity of her work. I make  no profit from this story.  The  character of Ti Xiu is my own creation.</p><p>C &amp; C  appreciated</p><p><b>Chapter  One:  Morning Dilemmas</b></p><p>It was a fall morning at the Tendo family  dojo.  The house was gradually filling  up with the sounds of its sleepy inhabitants slowly beginning yet another day  in the world.  Feet shuffled towards the  washroom, pans clattered in the kitchen, and voices began muttering drowsy  morning greetings.</p><p>Tendo  Nabiki, middle of the three Tendo daughters, noticed an envelope sitting near  the front door as she checked for her father's morning paper. It appeared to be  a letter that had somehow escaped notice the afternoon before.  Picking it up, she examined it closely,  noticing the Nepalese postmark and precise calligraphy address to "Young  Mistress Tendo Akane." It was evidently written by Ti Xiu, the little  Buddhist monk who had spent quite a bit of time at the dojo during a recent  visit to Nerima.</p><p>"Akane-chan!"  yelled Nabiki, adding her voice to the morning symphony, "There's a letter  here for you!"</p><p>Akane  carefully opened her letter over the breakfast table, before the other family  members arrived.</p><p><i>My child -<br/>I recently received the beautiful  wedding invitation from your father and Genma-san...</i></p><p>Akane  growled under her breath.  It was almost  like her father and Genma were the ones getting married, the way the two of  them were gushing over the wedding plans!   She didn't recall being consulted about the wedding invitations, but  realized after they had been sent that there was very little she could do about  it.</p><p><i>Forgive me if I am not able to attend your blessed day. Perhaps,  when we next meet,<br/>you and Ranma-kun will allow me  to say a few words over you.  I know, I know,<br/>Christian weddings are the fashion in Japan these days, and they certainly have  a<br/>romantic quality that a simple Buddhist  blessing lacks.  But I hope you will  indulge<br/>a foolish  old man.</i></p><p>Akane's eyes  glistened and pulsed, threatening to tear. How could Ti-sensei doubt that she  or Ranma would want his blessing, too? Not that she intended on going through with  a wedding of any kind in the near future, of course.</p><p><i>Would that I could be there to speak with you in person. This,  too, is the<br/>prerogative of old people when  young  people are married - the dispensation<br/>of unsolicited advice. I would share  with you some words from the teaching<br/>sometimes called the "Fire  Sutra".</i></p><p><i>The Buddha, when he was on this earth, had  many devoted followers.  One<br/>day he was approached by a man with a specific demand. "Teacher, you have<br/>taught us much - but there is so much  more you have not taught us.  Why are<br/>we here? Who is the Creator of the  Universe? How old is the world, and so on.<br/>Until you answer these questions, I cannot follow you any longer, no matter<br/>how truthful your teachings are."</i></p><p><i>To this the Buddha replied, "Foolish child.  You are like a man inside a burning<br/>house, who refuses to leave until he knows why the house is burning, how long<br/>it has been burning, if the fire was  set deliberately, and so on.  I have  tried to<br/>teach you the way out of your house  afire with suffering and misconception. If<br/>you have followed me, you know the truth of my words.  You must look to yourself<br/>to determine why it is you refuse to  accept them."</i></p><p><i>Akane-chan, at times knowing why things are is less important than  dealing with<br/>them as they exist, in a spirit of  compassion and mindfulness. If we let our<br/>questions become a barrier  to growing  and loving, we only do injury to<br/>ourselves and others.</i></p><p><i>May the face of the Tagathata Buddha smile on you always, my  child.</i></p><p>The letter  was signed with Ti Xiu's chop, inked in gold.</p><p>Akane would  have been surprised to learn that as she was reading, the author of her letter  was actually much closer than his monastery in Nepal.</p><p>The sound of  clattering pans and running water filled the kitchen of the "Cat  Café" as two young people began preparing the restaurant for another busy  day.  One of the room's occupants was a  tall young man. He wore glasses with lenses so thick they were almost  prismatic, and was occupied chopping a large white daikon radish. Beside the  stove stood a young girl bringing a large pot of water to boil. Her flowing  blue hair was done up in two crowning pigtails.</p><p>The calm of  their morning routine was broken when a flash of brown and black swooped  underneath the short noren curtain that hung above the restaurant door.  <i>"What is this?"</i> asked the  girl, speaking Chinese. A large, stately eagle hovered to a halt above the  kitchen's butcher-block counter.</p><p>With a flip  of his wrist, the young man reversed his grip on the cutting knife, and turned  in preparation to throw. <i>"Stand back, Xian Pu!" </i>he cried, also  in Chinese.</p><p><i>"Wait a  minute, Muu Su. He's not threatening us."</i> Nevertheless, Xian Pu also assumed the  alert stance of a martial artist preparing for the attack.</p><p>Far from  threatening, the eagle seemed to be ignoring the pair in general.  Waddling slightly, he walked across the  counter towards the stove, and with a small hop landed in the large pot of  steaming water. As water poured down the side of the vessel the fire underneath  hissed briefly, then sputtered and died.   Almost instantaneously, a small, elderly man flew out of the pot to land  on his feet before the two astonished young people.  He was balding, and his sole items of clothing were a pair of  gold-wired glasses and a Buddhist rosary made of cherry wood.</p><p>Gasping in  astonishment, the pair immediately threw themselves to the ground, faces to the  floor, with arms outstretched in a ritual posture of respect.</p><p><i>"Lord  of Serenity!"</i> both  intoned, <i>"How may we serve?"</i></p><p><i>"You  can start by getting up from the floor,"</i> replied the older man, a slightly exasperated tone in his voice. <i>"While  your respect for tradition warms my heart, one needs to recognize the realities  of the here-and-now. I abandoned all feudal titles many years ago."</i></p><p>The girl,  then the boy, looked up from the floor and reluctantly stood.  Ti Xiu looked at them a moment. <i>My, these  two as well,</i> he thought. <i>Might as well start calling this town Jusenkyo  west.</i></p><p><i>"Xian Pu,  child. How you have grown since I saw you last.  Also you, Muu Su, my dear son.   I was just in Nerima, but had no idea you were living here. I have come  to speak with your grandmother. Where might I find her?"</i></p><p><i>"She is  not here, Lord,"</i>  replied the girl, bowing her head slightly. <i>"She went to the country to  gather medicinal herbs.  We expect her  back in a day or two."</i></p><p><i>"Well,  one must wait if that is the case.  And  please, address me as Father Ti - that is sufficiently respectful."</i></p><p><i>"Yes,  Father Ti,"</i>  repeated the boy and the girl, in unison.</p><p><i>"Now,  my children, I would be most grateful if you could get me some clothes.  A saffron-colored robe would be particularly  nice..."</i></p><p>Ryouga awoke  late that morning.  The autumn sun cast  a deceptively warm glow through the orange nylon of his dome tent, which was  pitched in a convenient spot behind the Tendo garden.  The young martial artist stretched his stiff body slowly as he  prepared to get out of his sleeping bag.   <i>Damn, I'm accustomed to being sore after a workout, but this is  getting to be ridiculous. Ranma-kun and I need to have a serious discussion  about these late nights.</i> Ever since their return from that evening at  Tofu-sensei's mountain cabin, Ryouga had entertained nightly visits from Ranma  after the rest of the Tendo household was fast asleep.  A blush of pink unfolded across Ryouga's  face at the memory of last night's activities. Ranma seemed to have developed  an almost insatiable physical need for Ryouga.</p><p>At first it  was flattering, and reassuring.  Ryouga  had feared that he would be alone and lost again if Ranma's feelings for him  were a temporary situation. And after taking the drastic step of revealing his  inner feelings - something almost totally out of character - Ryouga worried  about his own reaction if the situation turned out for the worst.  Happily, none of his fears had come to pass.</p><p><i>Still</i>, thought Ryouga, shaking his head  silently as he rolled up his sleeping bag, <i>Who would have guessed that Ranma-kun  would be such a sex maniac? And I can't even tell him to take a cold shower...</i></p><p>As Ryouga  marched stiffly to the Tendo kitchen, hoping that perhaps Kasumi would pity him  with a bowl of leftover breakfast rice, Ranma and Akane were halfway to morning  classes at Furinkan High. Akane was carrying her books under one arm while  Ranma nonchalantly strolled beside her, balancing on the top of the fence that  ran along the sidewalk.</p><p>"Well,  Ranma-kun," said Akane, with a smile, "you certainly seem to be in a  good mood this morning!"</p><p>Ranma smiled  in reply. "Yep, I guess I am. But you aren't acting your normal loud  self.  What was in Ti-sensei's  letter?  Not bad news, I hope."</p><p>"Oh, no  - just the usual.  Some advice for the  soon-to-be-married."</p><p>"Whoa,"  said Ranma, shaking his head, "Don't tell me he got one of those crazy  invitations, too?"</p><p>"Yes,  of course he did. You know our fathers wouldn't miss an opportunity to show off  a foreign guest."  Irritation with  their meddling parents seeped into Akane's voice, darkening it slightly.  "What are we going to do with those  two, Ranma-kun, and this whole wedding mess?"</p><p>"You  worry too much. Things will work out, one way or another.  They always seem to."  Ranma did a small cartwheel along the top of  the fence, deftly catching his book bag when it threatened to fly off of his  shoulder.</p><p><i>My, he <b>is</b>  in a good mood,  </i>thought Akane. Suddenly, a horrible idea  rooted in her mind. <i>Oh, no - he isn't actually looking forward to our  wedding, is he?</i> It seemed inconceivable that Ranma might have finally  decided that he wanted to get married. Yet, his ridiculously happy behavior as  the date of their forced wedding loomed closer had to signify something.</p><p>This thought  made Akane even more irritated. <i>It's not as if I don't want Ranma to be  happy,</i>  she protested to  herself.  <i>He certainly deserves to  be, especially after the wretched childhood his father forced him to lead.</i>  But marriage between them had been their fathers' idea from the start. While  Akane had gradually grown to care for Ranma, it wasn't a romantic feeling.  Perhaps one would best describe it as a  desire to protect Ranma from his own massive stupidity.</p><p><i>If Ranma  isn't careful, he <b>will</b> end up married - but not to me. No, he'll end up  with a manipulative minx like Xian Pu, or worse yet, Kuno Kodachi.  And after all the effort I've made to  protect him, fighting those women and their miserable schemes!</i> Hearing Kodachi's awful, cackling laugh  echo in her head, Akane visibly shivered.</p><p>"Uhm,  you alright, Akane?" asked Ranma, looking over his shoulder. "It's  kinda chilly this morning. You wanna wear my jacket?"</p><p>"Oh,  no, that's okay..." Akane said.  <i>Oh,  no, that's bad!</i> she thought.  <i>He's  being way too considerate for Ranma.  He  really is acting like someone in love. But I don't love him in that way. Oh,  baka Ranma! Baka, baka Ranma! </i></p><p>Afternoon  activities at Furinkan that day centered on the upcoming girl's softball game  with the visiting American team, "Sapho Sluggers."  Tendo Akane (shortstop), Kuonji Ukyo (star  hitter) and Higurashi Yuri (pitcher) watched as the American team arrived at  the field for a pre-game tour of Furinkan.</p><p>"Principle  Kuno is looking surprisingly normal," observed Akane. The headmaster of  Furinkan High had donned a red, white and blue Hawai'ian shirt for the special  occasion, and appeared to be behaving very professionally, for a change.</p><p>"I  guess it's because he restricted himself to only three colors," cracked  Ukyo, causing all three girls to giggle.</p><p>"Well,"  said Yuri, edging her teammates forward, "Let's get a closer look at  tomorrow's competition."</p><p>The American  team had brought most of their equipment along, presumably to store it  overnight in the visiting team locker room.   All the girls wore souvenir baseball hats, a gift from the Nerima  Chamber of Commerce.  Each hat sported  American and Japanese flags, and had the girl's name stitched on the front.</p><p>"Hmm..."  said Ukyo, assessing their rivals.   "I don't like the looks of that one - 'Rosie' I guess." Ukyo  nodded her head in the direction of a stocky, dark-haired woman.</p><p>"Yeah,  she's a bruiser," replied Yuri. "Probably a big hitter.  How about the skinny one - 'Ellen'."</p><p>"She  looks like a pitcher to me," said Akane.</p><p>"Are  you sure?" asked Ukyo, squinting her eyes slightly. "I thought she  looked like a catcher."</p><p>"And  how about that one hanging on her?" observed Yuri. "Her hat says  'Anne.'  Is she human?"  The girl in question was a waify platinum  blond, with what looked to be two small antennae growing out of the top of her  head, poking up through holes in her hat.</p><p>While the  Japanese girls pondered this, several of the Americans began to unload  equipment from the bus. While most of the girls had standard canvas duffels,  three of the girls, 'Melissa', 'Tracey' and 'kd' carried objects that looked to  be suspiciously similar to guitar cases.</p><p>"Does  America have Yakuza?" asked Yuri, slightly anxiously.</p><p>"They're  called Mafia," replied Ukyo, "but they could never have gotten guns  in past customs."</p><p>While this was  somewhat reassuring, the three girls couldn't help but wonder what *was* in  those cases.</p><p>"Well,"  concluded Akane, as the three began walking back to class, "Whatever  happens tomorrow, it sure won't be boring."</p><p>The Fire  Sutra continues in Chapter Two: Indiscretions</p><p>C &amp; C  appreciated</p>
