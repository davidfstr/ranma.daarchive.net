</div><p><b>The Fire  Sutra  - A Ranma 1/2 Fanfic </b>By Ashoka Roque<br/>Book 3 of "Ashoro's Ranma Sutras"</p><p>Warnings and disclaimers; See Chapter One</p><p>C &amp; C  appreciated</p><p><b>Chapter Two:  Indiscretions</b></p><p>The shadow  of the gingko tree in the Tendo courtyard lengthened as the autumn day drew to  a close.  Its shade slowly stretched to  tickle the green boots of a certain bandana-wearing martial artist, who had  adopted a pose of threatening intent.</p><p>"Prepare  to die, Saotome Ranma!" screamed Ryouga, rather convincingly.</p><p>"Give  it up, Ryouga," replied Ranma, eyes flashing, "You'll never defeat  me!"</p><p>Both boys  began to spar vigorously.  The other  residents of the Tendo compound looked up briefly from their evening  activities. Then, with a shrug, Genma-panda continued to munch his bamboo,  Kasumi returned to preparing dinner, and Soan resumed reading his evening  paper. It was just another battle between the rivals, nothing out of the  ordinary.</p><p>But one  member of the Tendo clan felt something *was* different about this fight.  While not an expert in martial arts, she was  particularly observant - especially for a Tendo. Ti Xiu had aptly characterized  the Tendo's as "unable to see obvious facts about themselves and those  close to them." More precisely, the small monk has said this curse  effected -most- of the Tendo family.   That evening, one daughter in particular noted a visible difference in  the boys' scuffle.  An obvious  hesitation to put too much weight behind their punches. Unusual eye contact. A  close grab that lasted just a fraction too long before the pair broke away.</p><p><i>Hmmm, just  what happened between those two on their trip?</i> mused Nabiki. <i>And is there any way I  can make something out of it?</i></p><p><i>Well, after  a long day, I could certainly use a bath!</i> thought Akane.  <i>It  can't help but improve my mood.</i></p><p>Akane walked  into the bathroom after first calling out a warning.  She did not need to be confronted by a naked Ranma, Ryouga, Genma  or father tonight! With a small pleased sigh upon discovering that the room was  free, she hung her favorite bathrobe up by the door, and sat down on the bath  chair to clean up.</p><p><i>Honestly, my  hair certainly needs attention,</i> Akane admonished herself.   Placing the shampoo ring on her head to keep the thick foam off of the  rest of her body, she vigorously massaged the lavender-scented shampoo into her  scalp, enjoying how this simple act released some of the tension between her  temples.</p><p>After  rinsing and removing the shampoo ring, Akane didn't bunch up her hair in a  towel on top of her head.  Instead, she  shook it out gently and got into the tub for a long soak.</p><p>Akane's hair  hung lower when it was wet. She enjoyed the warm, moist feeling of it lying  softly across the back of her neck.   While she preferred her short haircut, moments like this made her recall  what it had been like to have long, flowing curls cascade gently down to her  shoulders.  Akane sighed, just a little  bit wistfully.</p><p>"Pensive  today, aren't we?" came Nabiki's voice from the washroom door. "Do  you mind having me as company?"</p><p>"Of  course not," answered Akane, with a small smile. "I'm just in a  little mood today."</p><p>Nabiki hung  her bathrobe by the door. "I would think you'd be excited, with the big  game tomorrow," she said, as she sat on the bath chair, stuck the  still-damp ring on her own head and began to shampoo her hair.</p><p>"Well,  this stupid wedding business is starting to get to me.  Did you see those awful invitations?"</p><p>"Akane-chan,"  said Nabiki, looking up from under her shampoo hat,  "Those 'awful' invitations cost 30,000 yen. You should be  glad I was able to add it to Dad's loan."</p><p>Despite  being up to her chest in deliciously warm water, Akane's insides grew slightly  chill. <i>Why does it always come down to money, with her?  She doesn't seem to care about anything  else.</i></p><p>But Nabiki  was concerned for her sister. Talk of the upcoming wedding reminded her about  Ranma and Ryouga, and her recent discovery. After a little mental exercise, and  some further observations over dinner, she had a pretty good idea of what was  up between the two of them.  <i>They had  better learn to be a little more discrete,</i> thought Nabiki, quietly shaking  her head<i>. Not than anyone else around here is likely to notice, but the rest  of the world isn't so naive.</i>  While  this recent revelation wasn't particularly a shock, Ranma was an area where  Akane was especially shortsighted. And if Akane might be hurt, this was an  occasion when potentially useful information just couldn't be held back.</p><p>Nabiki  finished rinsing her hair, and got into the tub next to her sister. "You  know, Akane-chan," began Nabiki, turning slightly towards her sister,  "There's something about Ranma I need to tell you."</p><p>"Really?"  replied Akane, suspiciously,  "And  I suppose it will only cost me 5000 yen. You must think I'm stupid. No thanks,  Nabiki-chan."</p><p>Nabiki's jaw  locked. Subtle veins of red shot across the top of her chest and up her neck. <i>Why  do I even bother? </i>she thought. Nabiki was often the only Tendo who clearly  saw through to the heart of the family's problems. As a small child, she had  tried to help by sharing her insights. Father needed to remarry, but he ignored  Nabiki's gentle reassurance.  Kasumi  obviously needed a life outside of the kitchen, but Nabiki only encountered a  blank stare when she tried to talk about Dr. Tofu's obvious affection.  The child Nabiki had often cried at night -  bitter, frustrated tears over her family's naivete. Eventually Nabiki hardened,  and developed a flippant way of responding to every situation. And she simply  stopped trying to help her family members in any way other than the one they  accepted.</p><p>Tendo Kasumi  assumed the motherly role of nurturing domestic spirit when Soan's wife had  died. And everyone showered Kasumi with love and affection in return. Nabiki,  on the other hand, had taken up the Japanese mother's traditional role as  custodian of the family finances. She devoted her time to keeping the Tendo  family's leaky economic boat afloat just a little bit longer, even when it  meant doing something ethically questionable. But her success only resulted in  everyone viewing her as manipulative, greedy and opportunistic. And Nabiki  gradually grew to perceive all her relationships as a financial calculation -  what was the cost, and what was the profit? And though she loved her family,  she couldn't help but feel superior when they were acting self-delusional. As a  result, she sometimes seemed devoid of normal human emotions like compassion  and affection.</p><p>Nabiki  realized all of this about herself, of course, but Akane's words still  hurt.</p><p>"Why  don't you just go to hell, Akane?" Nabiki quietly replied, her voice  shaking slightly. Slowly getting up out of the tub, she wrapped a towel around  her head, put on her bathrobe, and left the room in silence.</p><p>"Wait,  Nabiki-chan, I'm sorry!" cried Akane, belatedly.  Nabiki did not return, and Akane finished her soak in a miserable  mood.</p><p>The day of  the big game, the entire Tendo-Saotome clan descended on the ball field behind  Furnikan early enough to get good seats.</p><p>Genma and  Soan both made sure that Kasumi packed enough refreshments for a full  afternoon. Nabiki, Ranma and Ryouga rounded out the sextet.  The group settled on a bleacher bench that  offered the best view of shortstop position, so that they could cheer Akane.  Ranma and Ryouga watched both teams warming  up on the field. Yuri was throwing practice pitches to Akane, while Ukyo was  warming up by swinging three large spatulas stacked together.</p><p><i>Hmm,</i> though Ranma, <i>I thought she only had  one of those.</i>  Ranma's musing was  interrupted by a familiar shout.</p><p>"Hey,  Ranam-kun!"</p><p>Ranam looked  over to see two of his classmates, Hiroshi and Daisuke, walking towards where  he, Ryouga and the others were sitting.   Both boys wore the Furinkan school uniform - the standard white shirt  and gray-blue Nehru jacket. The pair settled in on the bench behind Ryouga and  Ranma.</p><p>"Sorry,  Ranma-kun, but we can't stay here too long," said Hiroshi.</p><p>"Yep,"  declared Daisuke, "We have to go down to the field and take some action  photos for the school paper."</p><p>Both boys  leaned forward, to rest their arms familiarly on Ranma's shoulders.  "You're the lucky one, Ranma-kun,"  said Hiroshi, almost breathing heavily into Ranma's right ear. "You live  under the same roof with the beautiful Tendo girls."</p><p>"Yeah,"  added Daisuke, almost breathing heavily in Ranma's left ear. "All we can  do is dream. Too bad most of those American girls are so...overly  athletic."</p><p>Both boys  momentarily wrestled Ranma backwards, pinning him against the bleacher seat  between them.</p><p>"Don't  you ever forget..." began Hiroshi.</p><p>"...how  lucky you are, Ranma-kun!" finished Daisuke.</p><p>Having  established their point, the pair released Ranma and made their way down from  the bleachers.</p><p>During this  incident, Ryouga's eyes had developed a slightly feral slant. "Well, well,  Ranma-kun.  It sure looks like those two  are pretty touchy-feely with you."</p><p>Ranma looked  around nervously, making sure no one was paying attention to their  conversation.  "Ryouga, it's  nothing," he whispered. "They always act like that."</p><p>"Ah, so  - they always hang on you. Well, that's certainly reassuring."</p><p><i>Damn,</i> thought Ranma, <i>Who would have guessed  that Ryouga would be so possessive?</i></p><p>"You  know," said Ranma, attempting to diffuse the situation, "You are  especially <i>kawaii</i> when you're jealous."</p><p>"Hmmph..."  sniffed Ryouga, eyes softening slightly, "I suppose I can postpone your  death for a little while longer, then."</p><p>As it grew  closer to gametime, the stands filled up with locals eagerly anticipating the  day's event.  Eventually, the P.A.  system squealed.</p><p><i>Welcome,  everyone, to this exhibition girl's<br/>softball game between the Furinkan Tsunami...</i></p><p>At this  point, applause broke out in the stands.   The announcer waited for a respectful moment, before continuing.</p><p><i> ...and the American team, the Sapho Sluggers!</i></p><p>Polite applause  this time, except from the small cheering section behind the American dugout,  which immediately broke out chanting, "U...S...A..!, U...S...A..!,  U...S...A..!" very loudly and enthusiastically.</p><p><i>"Our  distinguished referee,"</i> continued the announcer, when the noisy yankees had finally quit  cheering, <i>"is none other than Yoko Haruko, former president of the  International Girl's Martial Arts Softball Federation. She will oversee today's  match - a full seven innings played under Martial Arts Softball rules!"</i></p><p>This  announcement resulted in some murmurs from the Furinkan fans and team  members.  None of them had ever heard of  Martial Arts Softball. "Don't worry, girls!" said Yuri, reassuringly,  "If it's martial arts, Akane and Ukyo can handle it, right?"</p><p>"Right!"  affirmed Ukyo and Akane, voices united.</p><p>Up in the  stands, a few latecomers were straggling into the remaining open seats.  "Move away from Airen, Pig-Boy!"</p><p>Ryouga and  Ranma looked up to see Xian Pu and Muu Su.   As Ryouga moved over, Xian Pu grabbed Ranma in a rib-crushing hug.  Ranma's face grew red as he gasped for air. But this momentary irritation was  quickly overshadowed by the pleasant surprise of seeing the third member of the  trio.</p><p>"Ti-sensei!"  cried Ryouga.</p><p>"My  boys, how good to see you!" Ti Xiu said, with his subtle smile.  The little monk quickly explained that he  had returned unexpectedly to Nerima on an errand for his monastery. "But  it appears I will need to wait a few days before I can finish my business here.  Before I could visit the dojo, I happened to run into Xian Pu and Muu Su, who  are old friends from back home."</p><p>"I  thought you lived in Nepal?" said Ryouga, puzzled.</p><p>"Stupid  Chinese government," snapped Xian Pu, eyes flashing. "They tell  Father Ti and other monks leave China."</p><p>"Yes,"  agreed Mu Suu, "It was a highly unpopular decision."</p><p>"Things  are as they are," replied Ti Xiu, "but the government of Nepal has  been quite gracious."</p><p>"Okay!"  declared Xian Pu, releasing Ranma and standing up.  "Muu Su and I go now! Make lots money selling food to chubby  Americans!" With that, she proceeded to make her way down the bleachers.</p><p>"Wait  for me, my dearest darling!" cried Muu Su, hurrying after his beloved.</p><p><i>Poor Muu Su,</i> thought Ranma, watching the boy leave. <i> I know what it's like - to want someone you  can't have. Well, at least I have Ryouga now. </i>Ranma gave Muu Su what he  hoped was an encouraging wave as he chased after Xian Pu.</p><p>Ryouga,  noticing Ranma's attention, assumed the worst. <i>Why is Ranma such a flirt? I,  Hibiki Ryouga, will not tolerate this type of philandering behavior in my  potential life partner!</i></p><p>"He is  very nice looking, isn't he?" said Ryouga, under his breath.</p><p>"Uh,  what, Ryouga-kun?" asked Ranma, turning his head to look at his partner.</p><p>"Oh, I  was just saying," continued Ryouga, in a normal tone of voice, "That  Muu Su is quite a fine looking fellow. Especially that long, flowing  hair."</p><p>Ranma  winced. Ryouga's formerly long hair was only now starting to grow back from the  crew-cut he had suffered as the result of a fight between the two of them. And  Ryouga knew how guilty Ranma felt about it, too.</p><p>"Ah,  so," agreed Soan. "Long hair is the pride of a great martial  artist." This comment resulted in loud protestations from the cue-ball  headed Genma.</p><p><i>Boy, I might  have him now,</i> reflected  Ranma, <i>But how am I going to deal with him now that I got him?</i></p><p>The Fire  Sutra continues in Chapter Three: THIS is Shounen Ai?</p><p>C &amp; C  appreciated</p>
