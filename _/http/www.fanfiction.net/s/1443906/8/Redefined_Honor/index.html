</div>Redefined Honor<p>I have to thank every one who commented on this piece they will be able to immediately see that I tried to include criticism were I could. WSRaptor was invaluable for making this as good as it is and I emphasize the difference an editor can make to the reading of a story.<p>Thanks Man<p>Ch 8: Shifting the balance of power<p>Ranma assumed a horse stance, trying unsuccessfully to recreate the feeling that led up to his successful Ki attack. He could feel his Ki flowing through his body in amounts that surprised even him. Ranma slowly siphoned some of the excess Ki off and concentrated it into his shoulders, elbows and forearms as if he were preparing for a Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken. Concentrating further, he gathered it into his clasped palms forming a visible ball of living energy. Panting with effort, he attempted to throw his balled Ki to finish the attack. Ranma grunted with frustration, as the glowing ball of energy just seemed to pop and dissipate as images of his most recent fight flooded his thoughts and interrupted his concentration.<p>He had been astonished at the speed and fighting skill that Cologne had displayed when she had pulled all the stops. She was much faster and more skilled than he had thought possible and yet the shadow had matched her. Their unknown assailant had been out for blood and had seemingly matched her effortlessly. It amazed him that he had faired as well as he had against it and it was a testament to the training he had undergone that he had.<p>Ranma moaned in irritation as he replayed the fight in his head. Even being that much faster than him, he still should have faired better against a weapons user. Every weapons user he had ever encountered always fell back on set patterns and that had allowed him to ultimately win the match. That practice had reinforced his belief in the limited usefulness of weapons in a fight. He had been unable to find any pattern in his latest fight with the shadow though, despite its weapons use. It had used a style that was unlike anything he had ever seen before. If the situation hadn't been so dire, Ranma would have been ecstatic at the thought of learning new techniques or a new style. The thing was, however, the thought of being hunted down and killed by these things didn't really appeal to him.<p>Ranma knew that it was too much to hope for that the shadow had been alone. Someone had to have done the forecasting that it had mentioned which, in turn, meant that more highly skilled warriors would be after him. His only hope was to master the Ki move he had used towards the end of the fight. That move had at least slowed the shade down long enough for Ryoko to take it down.<p>Even then, he would need to conquer what he felt was a whole new level to his art. He knew that if he worked hard enough, that level could provide him with a string of lethal techniques. He flinched at that thought and looked at his hands, imaging the blood that could stain them in the future. It was frightening to think that they were already stained with blood, even if indirectly. If more warriors followed the other, then more blood would flow. The only thing he could hope for was that it would not be his or that of his friends.<p>He needed to master that move quickly and he didn't have time to slack in his other training either. Ranma had no doubt that Ryoga had managed to run straight into whatever search party Nabiki had organized. Heck, with his luck Ryoga had recognized where they were camping and had told them all where he was by now. He knew it was just a mater of time before they arrived. He vowed to himself that he would have mastered that move by the time they arrived along with some serious thought on the creation of more.<p>Thinking about the others and the problems that they would inevitably bring with them, Ranma couldn't help but think about Ryoko and the Amazons. He had been pleasantly surprised by the fact that Ryoko had been just as keen on training and martial arts as he. What was even more pleasant was the fact that for the first time in a long while he had met someone who would spar with him and not cause him any trouble. He had been equally surprised when the Amazons had shown up and had also offered him the same deal.<p>Over the course of his training trip both the Amazons and Ryoko had helped enormously with his training and he in turn had proven himself a worthy sparing partner. They had all set such a harsh pace that he had not even thought to ask what his companions planned to do after the trip was over. However, with the approach of his acquaintances from Nerima and the arrival of his mum he could almost feel that ending approaching.<p>Despite the harsh pace he had set as they traveled the length of Japan training, he had given some thought to the solving his problems. Therefore, when they arrived, he would put the plan he had developed into place. He found it slightly fitting that he would solve his problems in a place where he had not only touched the next level of his training, but also discovered a little bit about the family he never knew.<p>The success of his plan all depended, though, on how sincere the Amazons were and how Nabiki reacted. With the way his life had been going lately, he would solve his current problems only to have them replaced with larger more complicated ones. Once again assuming a horse stance and concentrating on his Ki, Ranma resumed his training.<p>*****<p>Sitting back and relaxing as much as she could under the watchful eye of Ryoko, Nodoka considered her son. After finally finding him, she had not expected such an apathetic reaction. Sure, from what she had heard from Soun's middle daughter his life had been a little rough but surely that would be even less reason to greet her so. Even the slight misunderstanding they had upon first meeting almost sounded commonplace in his life and no one had been hurt so that couldn't have been the reason for his cool reception.<p>For the moment his companions worried her more than his reaction to her announcement though. She knew better than anyone except perhaps her father what her son's future held and she wanted smooth over any future hurdles before they happened and garner as much support as she could. After all, traditionally it was the mother of the heir that held the most influence in any future harem and she could not maintain that role without a medium of support. It was not hard to misplace the over protectiveness Ryoko felt towards her son anymore than the discreet longing in Shampoos eyes.<p>Without that support, she would not have the authority inside the future harem of her son to do what needed to be done nor the required influence over Ranma. After all, she only had his best interests at heart.<p>"Ryoko?" she smiled pleasantly trying to create repour, "How did you meet my son?" Nodoka ignored the not so subtle signs of interest displayed by the other two women. She had assumed that having traveled together they at least would have been familiar with Ryoko.<p>"That is something that will remain between the two of us," Ryoko announced, firmly rebuffing Nodoka's attempt at conversation. "I'm sure you would be far more interested in how he met the Amazons than me anyway," Ryoko tossed negligibly as she floated further from the group.<p>Nodoka's smile became strained, "I've already heard that particular tale child. I assure you, I would find yours much more interesting."<p>"Look lady," Ryoko yawned absently looking at Nodoka with disdain "I don't much care and you obviously don't know as much as you think if that's what you're interested in."<p>Her smile dipped a little as she wondered at the arrogance of the young woman in front of her. Imagine, lecturing her on her own son! She opened her mouth to say as much when two loud explosions rocked the clearing. Nodoka jerked her head and stared in the direction that the explosion had come from completely missing the fact that Ryoko had disappeared from the clearing.<p>"Sounds like Ranma finally mastered that technique," Cologne cackled from where she rested before lapsing into a series of throaty coughs.<p>"Will Ranma by alright Grandmother?" Shampoo asked worriedly from her side.<p>"Ask him yourself Grand daughter," Cologne gestured to Ranma as he limped out of the trees that surrounded the clearing.<p>Nodoka watched as Shampoo stared at her limping son while he tried to brush off Ryoko's offer of help "Aya, Ranma you ok?"<p>Ranma grinned at Shampoo, "Never better Shampoo. Thanks for asking." His grin turned to a worried frown, "How are you feeling? You both had me worried in that last fight." His gaze took in both Amazons. "I'm afraid that we're about to receive visitors from Nerima and I don't want anyone getting hurt, especially if they haven't completely recovered from yesterday."<p>Nodoka watched her son's exchange with the Amazon girl, once again feeling left out even with what Nabiki had told her. She really had missed out on his best years. Still, she was with him now and she would have a very long time to catch up in the future. Besides, if the search party from Nerima was going to catch up to them soon, she couldn't help but feel that she wouldn't remain ignorant for long. Which reminded her, "Son, my father really wants to meet you. It is very important," Nodoka had been able to sense her father's urgency when she talked to him earlier even if she hadn't been told the cause.<p>Besides she was sure after hearing what little the others had known of her son's life, he would not take kindly to being forced into a role he knew nothing about. If she were to keep any ties with her son as his mother, it would be best for any news to come from her father. "I can't pretend that I can just walk back into your life after so long but please…son, I have missed you these past 10 years."<p>She watched, as her sons face seemed to contort in an expression of emotional pain causing her to fear that it was too late, that her husband had caused too much damage. However, he just smiled before answering, "I would like that mum. You and grandpa will be surprised. For now we need to prepare for some visitors."<p>Turning to address the young teal haired woman that kept hovering protectively around him, Ranma quietly whispered a request that she could barely hear. "Ryoko, you have heard a lot of my past and I don't want you to hurt anyone too badly, even if they attack me." Nodoka nodded at the precaution. She had seen how protectively the young girl was of her son and that energy blade that she could somehow produce looked deadly. Despite the warning, she didn't much like the pleased smirk Ryoko seemed to reply with. She had no doubts that her son would have been able to handle anyone who attacked him more gently, but then maybe that was the point.<p>After seeing Ryoko's feral grin, Nodoka was a little worried for anyone who would dare cross Ranma. However, her thoughts were derailed as one of the people traveling with Nabiki, Kuno if she remembered correctly, descended from the treetops with a live blade. "So, it's true! The foul sorcerer Saotome has enchanted my sultry amazon princess and has begun to enslave more women into his harem!" Kuno's announcement seemed to echo through the trees almost drowning out the arrival of the others. "I will not allow it! I, Tatewaki Kuno, the blue thunder, will free them along with the pig tailed girl!"<p>"Ryoga was right! You weren't training at all, but stealing away with other girls! You pervert!" Akane raged obviously looking around for something to hit Ranma with. Nodoka had to wonder, though, why she didn't just use that mallet that she carried around with her.<p>"Saotome, do you know how long I've been trudging through the wilderness looking for you? You owe me big time and I plan to collect!" menaced Nabiki. She had heard of Akane's part in her son's messed up life as well as Nabiki's.<p>"Ran-chan! How could you even think of replacing me? Aren't I your cute fiancée?" Ukyo almost whined.<p>Nodoka just watched the unfolding drama with interest. Ranma's training in martial arts had been exceptional, but from what she had heard his people skills were abysmal. It was something she needed to work on quickly if she was to prepare her son for the rigors of ruling. For the moment, though, she just watched. Hearing what he was like with people was one thing, seeing was another.<p>She was pulled from her thoughts by the sword wielding samurai wacko "Yes, the vengeance of heaven is slow, but sure! I will free all the women you have bewitched from your dark magic so they will be free to date with me! Have at thee!" The crazed kendoist then charged Ranma with the intent to impale him. However, before the situation could degenerate further, a large yellow ball of energy slammed into Kuno diverting his course from Ranma and causing him to crash limply to the ground with his katana singed and his body smoking. He managed to gasp out "I fight on..." before he collapsed.<p>"Hello Ukyo, Akane. Nabiki, you're just in time..." Ranma smiled at the middle Tendo graciously before looking around at the group that crowded the clearing and completely ignoring Kuno's smoking body except for checking that he was still breathing. "If you'll all sit down and join us, I'll explain what I've been up to." Following his own advice he dragged one of the larger fallen branches that bordered the clearing and took a seat.<p>"Not quite foul sorcerer! No demon summoned from even the lowest depths of hell could stop the mighty Kuno and his righteous blade. Have at thee!" he lunged with his still singed blade and smoking hair only to be met by a smirking Ryoko with a crackling bar of yellow energy.<p>"So you fancy yourself a swordsmen, Kuno? I've only been defeated once in my demon days and it wasn't by a Kuno." Nodoka watched as Ryoko seemed to take great joy out of thoroughly overwhelming the wannabe samurai and beating him to a pulp. Only Ranma's request seemed to restrain her from doing anything permanent. Again, the measured display seemed to put the crowd from Nerima on edge.<p>Everyone seemed to look fearfully at the teal haired woman at Ranma's side, the woman who seemed to have enjoyed blasting and later beating Kuno into oblivion. No one seemed inclined to take him up on his offer to take a seat as they were still taken aback by the almost casual way Kuno had been dealt with and the massive change in Ranma's personality. After all, a few weeks ago he would not have condoned such a beating or been so calm about the thought of facing them.<p>"For too long my apparent indecisiveness has been causing everyone problems. It was one of the reasons I decided to go on this training trip." Ukyo shifted nervously from where she stood while Akane just glared angrily at Ryoko and the Amazons. Ranma just continued, ignoring the fact that they apparently weren't paying attention to what he was saying. "I have come to a decision which will end this now."<p>"I knew you would choose your cute fiancée, Ran-chan!" Ukyo cried smiling cutely at Ranma, suddenly giving him all her attention.<p>"I always knew you were a pervert Ranma!" Akane screamed hefting the log conveniently placed at her feet.<p>"Whatever you had planned Ranma you better do it soon," Cologne announced from where she sat. She was obviously finding amusement in the unfolding drama.<p>Nodoka just watched as the situation started unraveling before siding up to Nabiki well back from the commotion, "Why exactly did you bring them all here Nabiki?"<p>"Initially because they paid me auntie..." started Nabiki as she stared at Ranma trying to defuse the situation. If the second Tendo daughter felt any distress from confronting Nodoka after their last encounter, she showed no sign. She also showed no guilt at the way she treated Ranma over the past year.<p>"And now?"<p>"Ever since I found that note, I've been intrigued. Ranma seems to have changed so much since we all last saw him and…"<p>The whirring of a blade filled the air interrupting their conversation followed by a large thunk of something solid hitting the ground. Nodoka refocused on the confusion towards the center of the clearing. It seemed something had come to a head. She saw a stunned looking Akane with half a log in her hand as Ryoko stood menacingly in front of Ranma with her sword held defensively.<p>"I guess you didn't all read the note I left telling everybody that things would be different when they saw me next so please sit down and I'll tell you what I've decided." This time Nodoka and Nabiki followed the others in sitting down to listen to what Ranma had to say. They all seemed a little unnerved by the grinning woman that had control of so much power and enjoyed taking apart Kuno. Nodoka casually passed her gaze over the unconscious boy to judge his condition and was quite surprised seeing that he wasn't nearly as injured as she suspected. She looked at her son with a great deal more respect than she had previously. He had staged that wonderfully. It seemed that with some tutoring, she could make him into a great leader and ruler.<p>"So tell us what wonderful solution you dreamed up that can solve all your problems," Nabiki commented wryly waiting for Ranma's decision. It was clear that despite the note and evidence so far Nabiki didn't have much respect for her son's intelligence.<p>Ranma just grinned at Nabiki as if to say 'you'll like this one.' "It's quite simple. I will be canceling my engagements to both Ukyo and Akane."<p>"But...what about my dowry Ran-chan?" shouted Ukyo angrily as she tightened her grip on her battle spatula. A quick glance at Ryoko had her quickly releasing it just as quickly however. "You can't just throw away that responsibility or the ten years of my life I spent tracking you down!"<p>"What about the Chinese hussy?" gritted out Akane. Her eyebrows seemed to twitch and her hands curled as if she were getting ready to strike out at something or someone.<p>"Ukyo, your dowry and the ten years on the road is something I need to talk with you about in private," Ranma said firmly. "Go back to Nerima Ukyo. We will talk soon, I promise."<p>"Ran-chan..." Nodoka watched as Ukyo took a step towards Ranma before nodding and turning away despondently after taking another look at Ryoko.<p>"Go with her Akane and take Nabiki with you. I'm sure she'd appreciate it." Nodoka shook her head disappointingly as Akane lashed out with her mallet. She lacked even the basic control that Ukyo held over her emotions. She held her breath along with Nabiki as she waited for a massacre similar to what happened to Kuno.<p>Ranma, it seemed, had overcome his reluctance to strike women on his training trip. She watched her son lash out quickly disabling the youngest Tendo and rendering her unconscious. "Take them away Nabiki," he said glancing at Kuno and Akane. "While the engagements have been dealt with, there are other issues that need to be cleared up in Nerima. First, though, I'm going to see the rest of my family." Nodoka watched as Nabiki shot a grateful look at Ranma as she dragged Akane and Kuno after Ukyo. She suspected that Nabiki understood what it had taken her son to hit her sister and respected his restraint.<p>Taking a closer look at Ranma, she begun to comprehend that the encounter with his friends from Nerima had taken a higher toll than she realized. He seemed to be breathing and sweating heavily as if he had just run a marathon. "Son," she started only halting when looked at her with eyes that showed just how emotionally drained he was. After seeing the chaos that seemed to follow him, she could understand how he must be feeling. How he had managed it for so long, she would never know.<p>No matter how much she would like to have the emotional torture end for her son, she knew that her father would have none of it and so she would make the best of it for herself and Ranma.<p>Ranma just nodded tiredly and responded to her unasked question, "Let me tell you what you've missed out on for the last ten years. You can let your father know to expect us sometime tomorrow then." Nodoka looked on in surprise and then exchanged a worried expression with the Amazons as Ranma started to laugh softly at first and then louder with an edge of insanity about it. Ryoko just seemed to hover as close to Ranma as she could as they all gathered around to here Ranma tell the full story of his life.<p>*****<p>President Clarke stared at the dull grey concrete walls that surrounded him. He couldn't believe that through his years of budget scrutiny and greater senate transparency that the military had been able to skim enough money to build such a large underground complex. He was told that the huge underground compound that he had been whisked away to along with the military elite and planners was self-sufficient. It was perfectly capable of holding out indefinitely despite the impressive size of a small town.<p>He had little time to explore though before he was bundled into a meeting with the very elite, which had brought him here. Opposite him sat 4 star and 3 star Generals and even some Admirals. If it hadn't been for his time in the forces, he would have been quite intimidated which was probably why they had done it.<p>"Let me get this straight gentlemen. You want me to give you unquestioned control over homeland defence." Bob just shook his head. These fools actually thought he would just hand over the keys to the military might of the world's only super power. The president's position of Commander-in-Chief was created to balance the power of the generals. He would not willingly upset that balance. "I suppose you want my authority to let you use our arsenal of nukes at your discretion as well?"<p>"I know it is difficult for you Mr. President, considering your military experience but it would be best for you to allow us to run the war," interceded a four star general.<p>Bob thought over what he had seen of the compound so far. Something so big couldn't have been constructed over the course of his presidency alone but probably over many. Then, there was the speed in which he had been evacuated. The aliens had hardly touched down and he was already securely stashed away in this over grown bunker. Things had happened too conveniently for his tastes.<p>"That general, I still haven't decided. If you would answer a few questions for me first, it would put my mind at ease." Bob sat back in his chair and organised his thoughts. Among the people pressuring him to relinquish his rights as Commander-in-Chief were some very senior and very experienced men. It wasn't enough to just deny them. He had to win them over or at least gain their respect.<p>"Tell me about this place. When it was built? What's its purpose?"<p>He watched the men squirm a little before one of the more senior 4 star Generals answered him. It seemed he was on to something. "Just after world war II, it had become obvious to the world that we had emerged a superpower. The military minds of the day conceived a plan that would cement our superiority further on the world stage and so this complex was built as a dedicated lab for the development of various technologies. Over the course of the cold war, the risk of Soviet infiltration made it necessary to hide the lab and so we hid it."<p>"How could you hide something like this?" Bob demanded. "Hundreds of people must have known about it."<p>Once again the General shifted uncomfortable, "It was much smaller back then. The compound was only expanded in order to make the community self-sufficient. Still you're right Mr. President. Records were destroyed and people were assassinated. This place disappeared in the 1960's."<p>Bob watched as everyone seemed to fidget as if they were uncomfortable. They should be if he was reading between the lines correctly. After all, JFK was assassinated in 1963. "Since then, this place has been dedicated to computer, weapons and space research. As you can see, we are actively fortifying this place so that it can become our base of operations as soon as you give us the go ahead."<p>"So that's how you were able to respond so quickly to this threat general?" the elderly general's worried frown and slight nod told Bob all he needed to know. The man was concerned that he had given away too much information.<p>"How long were you aware of extraterrestrials on earth general and who else knew?" Bob demanded in a tone he would have used to chew out his own men back when he was actively leading missions. "Exactly how long have you been aware of the possibility of a code blue invasion?" he yelled into the commotion he had stirred up among the men he was facing down. Strangely the Admirals were quiet, choosing to stay out of this particular power struggle. The silence of the Admirals made him hope that he could still gain enough support to retain control over the precarious situation he had found himself in.<p>"Enough!" shouted a relatively young general quickly calming the commotion he had caused before addressing him. "It seems we have underestimated you a little sir." Bob looked at the general in surprise. He would have expected someone more senior to be in charge.<p>"It was about the same time that we started construction on this compound that we were approached by someone claiming to be a member of the Jurian Royal family. He told us that Earth had been part of Jurian territory for hundreds of years, but until our technology advanced a little more they would respect our sovereignty."<p>"Of course we scoffed at the very idea of being a colonial back water to a galactic empire but he was… persuasive. Since then, we have been even more focused on security because even with his assurances we have had our own experiences that would cause us to worry. We recently received a communication that the Jurian Empire had been invaded with overwhelming force and we have seen the result."<p>"So, we must become out of necessity more involved with events outside of our own backyard." Bob sat back exhaling loudly. It was even worse than he had imagined. Damn he hated politics sometimes. "Keep me in the loop at all times and I will give you your authority. However, I wish to retain the power of veto in all operations."<p>The room of men nodded before filling out. Only the young general remained. "It would be good for moral if you became active in your military role once again. We have the technology to repair the damage to your leg and God help us, we need all the help and fighting experience we can get."<p>Bob just nodded in thought as the young general left the room. He had many things to think about.<p>*****<p>Ayeka walked into her father's throne room. It was unusual for her to be summoned by her father. Usually, he left her to her own devices, trusting that she knew her role well enough that he didn't need to interfere. Even if he was her father, he was also the emperor though so maybe he had something specific in mind.<p>"What is it father?" she asked before noticing that they were not alone. Stepping away from the shadows, an elderly man with thick grey hair and matching moustache approached her. "Daughter, this war is rapidly spiraling out of control despite the short respite the enemy has given us. Our factories are churning out ships at ever increasing rates and our scientists are developing more powerful weapons making the ships increasingly more powerful."<p>"I have decided to place the newly built ships under a separate banner. Their only responsibility would be to protect our borders from external threats. This will free up the galaxy police for peace keeping which has been neglected since the start of the war. I'm putting the Jurian defence armada under your command."<p>"Father," she objected, "W-what do I know of commanding a military fleet?"<p>"That's what Eishi is for. He has the experience and the expertise to build a fierce war engine, but you will be in charge so learn what you can as quickly as you can. Do you understand me?"<p>Ayeka looked at the older man before nodding uncertainly towards her father and turning to leave. "Ayeka, fleet personnel will be directly funded by the emperor and the council."<p>She almost stumbled in comprehension. Her father was creating a middle class. With the continuation of the war, the overwhelming military might of the nobles was being stripped away. As the war progressed, it was foreseeable that the might of the galaxy police and the fleet created to fight invaders would equal the might of the nobles. Provided they won this war, such a change in the balance of power would be disastrous. By creating a middle class, direct dependence on the noble class such a political shifts in power could be limited, while maintaining at least a moderate advantage for the noble class..<p>"Lets get started Eishi," she commanded "The sooner we have our fleet shoring up our defences, the better. We have people to train and hierarchies to construct." Her father had placed a large responsibility on her shoulders, but she thought he had made a very wise and forward thinking decision.<p>*****<p>Ryoga strode somewhere, struggling with his overly large pack. Frankly, it had been a guess that he had been lost in Hokkaido when he had encountered Ranma and he hoped that it had been correct. While he was glad that he had been granted the opportunity to let Akane know what Ranma was up to, he was as depressed as hell that he had gotten lost before getting the chance to give Ranma his much deserved pounding.<p>It didn't seem fair that Ranma always seemed to get everything he wanted, never once failing to rub Ryoga's nose in it. Why? He was twice the man Ranma was and yet he was constantly out done by Ranma. Why?<p>Ryoga stopped, letting his depression rage and seethe and thought about a certain technique he had learnt while lost looking for Ranma. Allowing his depression to peak he cupped his hands and let out a roar...<p>Shishi Höködan!<p>If anyone had been looking, they would have seen a sickly green ball of plasma rise up into the sky from miles away. Ryoga just smiled grimly. He would get his revenge!<p>A/N – Ok keep in mind he has been with Ryoko and the Amazons for some time. Cologne in particular would not put up with poor language skills, how often is she reprimanding Shampoo "Speak Japanese girl".
