</div><p>Redefined Honor</p><p>Book 1 Ch 12: The Eclipse of Homo Sapiens</p><p>Nabiki looked nervously up at the young teal haired warrior as the self admitted pirate glided several inches off then ground towering several heads above her. What was Ranma thinking sending Ryoko along to accompany her, he knew she worked best alone. Getting the inhabitants of Nerima to trust her was going to be hard enough with the current uncertainty and danger over shadowing everyone, her ice queen reputation wouldn't make things easier either.</p><p>Still with events as they were and the armed mob he had so recently taken care of she knew better than to argue. When their survival tied so closely to Ranma's skills and protection it was better follow his lead. Besides if there was anyone not related to them that she could trust to protect her family, deep down she knew it was probably him. After all this time he was almost family anyway.</p><p>Nabiki glanced nervously at Ryoko once again, even going so far as to open her mouth to ask about Ranma's plans before she clamped it shut. Why had he sent her along, from what she had deduced from the brief outline of events that Cologne had described to them before Ranma had interrupted, Shampoo or perhaps the old ghoul herself would have been a better choice for protection. There was no question in her mind that either would have suited her better, she still had visions of Ryoko's pleased grin as she ruthlessly took down Kuno in the forested clearing when they had finally caught up with Ranma earlier.</p><p>That image chilled her, at least she had some experience with Ranma and his fiancées allowing her to catalogue them. She had long established how best to deal with them, extort money and information from them or generally bend them to her will. Ryoko could be capable of anything and for Ranma to trust the pirate with her safety and the safety of the refugees Nabiki knew that the flying girl was in Ranma's league where skill and power were concerned.</p><p>There had to be a reason that Ranma sent Ryoko rather than a fiancé or another martial artist Nabiki was familiar with. If another armed mob descended upon them she was sure from what she had seen Cologne, Shampoo and maybe at a pinch even Ukyo could have guarded her just as well. As for convincing survivors that she offered a safe haven for them and their family, security against the collapsing of the old order, someone recognizable would definitely have done a better job.</p><p>The people of Nerima might not like the amazons, or the destruction caused by the chaos surrounding Ranma but they would have respected his strength. Why Ryoko? Was she giving Ranma too much credit? Before he had left she would not even be thinking along these lines but it was very clear to her that he had grown up and started to use the street smart intelligence that for too long he had suppressed. Not to mention his willingness to use his martial arts, she would never have imagined he could have been capable of that before he left. The sounds of the melee and the sickening echo's of the massacre echoed in her head reminding her that even with modern weaponry these martial artists stood a world apart. If the aliens were worse – she shuddered to think.</p><p>"I know what your thinking Nabiki," Ryoko drawled smirking art her from her elevated position. Nabiki only barely managed to restrain a frightened flinch, imagining what such a powerful fighter could do to her if they wanted to.</p><p>"Do tell," Nabiki's tone was cool but she didn't think she was fooling the teal haired pirate. Only the scuffling sound of the crowd of refugees that had been persuaded to join and currently trailed them prevented her from shivering in fright. Without Ranma to restrain her Nabiki didn't know what Ryoko was even capable of.</p><p>"You're wondering if Ranma has sent me to get rid of someone who has been such a problem to him, someone who caused him so much pain and discomfort for a significant amount of time." Ryoko's voice didn't carry to the people shuffling behind them, it was for her ears alone.</p><p>"Not at all," Nabiki forced a calculated grin to her face. "Ranma would never do anything to hurt anyone, and sending someone out to kill even an enemy isn't honorable. Even I know how much Ranma holds to his honor." 'A fine argument before this whole mess began' she thought but now she really didn't know what to expect. Ranma had changed so much it was frightening and she had no idea what he planned.</p><p>"You would be very surprised how much he has redefined his honor Nabiki. For too long he has let himself be manipulated by it. He has changed," Ryoko's pleased grin swam closer causing Nabiki to step back allowing the colomn of refugees to catch up. That expression was the same one she wore as she was brutally quelling the Kuno samurai.</p><p>"Nabiki is it true, is Ranma really back." Nabiki stifled a sigh of relief as a student, or at least a previous student since Furinkan had long been destroyed, caught up with them causing Ryoko to retreat from their exchange. Bunzo was a relatively new student to Furinkan and so had only witnessed a couple of Ranma's challenge fights before Ranma had disappeared for more training. Seeing those challenge fights and being brought up to date on Ranma's achievements had quickly let Bunzo form a view that Ranma could solve the world's problems. Certainly he had been told so many tales of Ranma's achievements that even had she told him some stories of his not so godly times she knew he wouldn't listen.</p><p>To someone who hadn't lived in Nerima all there lives she could see how Bunzo could have so quickly become enamored with the martial artist. "It is true Bunzo, he arrived just in time to repel an attack on the dojo."</p><p>Unlike Ryoko's earlier words her's were over heard by the crowed. Not that it mattered since they had almost reached the dojo anyway, 'Ranma can explain his plan to them all when they arrived' she thought cattily. She didn't like being left in the dark, "I thought you said that the Tendo dojo was safe, so why are only now finding out that it suffers attacks like the rest of the city? How is that safer than anywhere else?"</p><p>Nabiki glanced at Ryoko for help, she knew Ranma was good but even she had reservations about how he would manage against a threat which the armies of the west with all their technology and budgetary might hadn't been able to stop. It was obvious that the pirate next to her held some if not all the answers but she seemed unwilling to share them. "It is common sense that we are more secure together than scattered all over Tokyo." Nabiki commented wryly over her shoulder.</p><p>"Besides Ranma Saotome is back," shouted Bunzo amid cheering from a group of boys clustered to the back of the crowd. "And he never loses," Nabiki sniffed in amusement. While that was technically true she could recount stories of when he had lost matches even if he had come back to eventually win.</p><p>It had surprised her that in all the destruction and death some of the students of Furinkan had started to look to Ranma for safety. Certainly he had always stood up for the students against Principle Kuno and his son on school grounds but how could they imagine Ranma could save them from this. Even if he could match the aliens where nations had failed what could one martial artist do rebuild the world.</p><p>'No', Nabiki thought as the entrance to the dojo came into view, while she didn't share their faith in Ranma alone saving them she wouldn't refute the relevance of their opinion. After all they needed something to hold onto, something that couldn't so easily be shattered as their life had been. Ranma provided a rock of reality for them in the dangerously shifting sands of society, when they could be shot by bandits at anytime believing that someone earthly held the strength to save them was all that kept them going. The government couldn't save them and the American military bases had been over run from what she had heard so why not Ranma?</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"So," Nodoka sat calmly on the tatami with her Katana across her knees, in front of her sat Kasumi, Akane, Ukyo and Shampoo. Kasumi was staring at her hands as if still holding the child that Ranma had brought in earlier while Akane was looking blankly at the wall, not aware of anything. Ryoga's violent outburst had fractured a belief that Akane had held unshakable. Shampoo sat proud as if her status as a warrior was enough and Ukyo was obviously ready to curry favor for Ranma's hand.</p><p>She had tried to garner support from her sons many fiancée's while he was training, so that she could guide him to her wishes. Even going so far as to try and subtly manipulate him directly, the fate of the empire was to great to be left to a inexperience teenage boy. So far she had been unsuccessful. Yosho had made it adamantly clear that Ranma's return to Jurai was vital for the survival of the empire.</p><p>In the early stages of the war her father had kept her informed of the progress of the enemy and the frequent losses of ships and territory suffered by her people. Since he had been cut off from Jurai he had become more desperate in his entreaties for her to do something about Ranma's stubbornness. Now that she had reached the Tendo dojo it was time to act. Past time to act, if the empire wasn't in so much trouble she might have continued her subtle political struggle for power but as it was that time had long past.</p><p>"What are your plans for my son? As his mother I don't want to see him hurt from a prolonged struggle for his affections." Over emphasizing her concern for her son only managed to firmly tie her to Ranma in their eyes as she had hoped. She knew they all hoped to marry her son and so dealing with his mother they hoped would give them the advantage in the contest for his heart. Nodoka just hoped that they didn't find out about the polygamous tradition of his station before she had firmed her grip over the girls. They would become the most powerful women in the empire when her son assumed the throne and that power wasn't to be sneezed at or the influence over it she would gain as their mother in law.</p><p>Suon's recent death and Colognes momentary absents could only aid her cause here. While she cared for her son and was saddened by Suon's death and momentarily interested in Mousse, her sons other rival, she wouldn't let it distract her from her task. Billions of lives hung in the balance. And Dealing with children should be childs play to her – still she would have to go slowly.</p><p>"Auntie," Ukyo's voice was sweet as she bowed showing proper respect for a husband's mother- presumptuous. "We are all engaged to marry Ranma. His father has already accepted my dowry and..."</p><p>Nodoka cut her off at the mention of Genma and his past activities, he could have ruined everything with his careless behavior. Certainly he had come very close to permanently damaging her son, no disabled emperor had every ruled Jurai or ever would. There political system would not allow it.</p><p>"My husband's behavior has no bearing on this discussion." She growled a little thinking of Genma – he had best not return. "I am familiar with your situation Ukyo," Nodoka started gently "but you must realize that there are other claimants for my sons hand as well. Claimants that are as strong or stronger than your own. Shampoo offers an alliance with the Amazon village with all the knowledge and power that entails. Kasumi's father made the ultimate sacrifice only wishing for the union of both his schools."</p><p>She noticed Shampoo sat proudly, her expression fierce. Truly she would make an excellent match for her son. She had to consider the future however and it would only be aided if his Jurai blood was strengthened in an heir, only someone as powerful as her son or more so would ever be able to rule. Sasami would provide a good match for her son and she had heard some great things said about her. Besides she had heard that she was just young enough not to have formed strong opinions about anything yet while her sister would no doubt have spent too long ruling and have become set in her ways. No wife Ranma chose would be allowed to contest her own power. She would have to arrange a meeting when they returned to Jurai. Still she had no doubt that her son would choose one if not all of the girls in this room if he had the option and so any relationship she could nurture would only be to her benefit.</p><p>"Ukyo," she slowly raised the girl up from where she still bowed "be assured that I have no objection to your suitability. Any choice is ultimately my son's decision to make but I will welcome you as a daughter in law regardless of his decision."</p><p>Ukyo brightened visibly with a spaced out grin on her face, Nodoka could only imagine how she had interpreted what she had said. An ally for life that girl, as long as she remained besotted by her son. Now the other three and then perhaps she could use them to maneuver her son back to his rightful throne.</p><p>"Shampoo of the Joketsuzoku please…" she gestured for Shampoo to tell her about her son and what she planned for him. Shampoo was clearly as besotted as Ukyo though not as blinded by love.</p><p>"Ranma is great warrior who is already married to me by our laws." Shampoo's fierce expression bored into her own, challenging her authority. Her relation to the matriarch had no doubt taught her about power and when it came to Ranma Nodoka could see that not much would cause her to back down. Still Nodoka's authority could not be questioned and the Amazon matriarch was not here. "Shampoo, the world is a very big place with too many laws. If and when Ranma recognizes those laws…" she let her eyes harden. Her expressions was as soft and friendly as ever but her eyes shone with age, experience and authority forcing the girl to back down. The young Joketsuzoku wouldn't be able to match that for many years. Shampoo would make an excellent addition to her sons harem as long as she bowed to her authority.</p><p>Glancing between the tendo sisters she judged that Akane would not be able to react in any intelligent way until she had sorted through whatever had upset her so much. It was strange as far as she knew Ryoga was always trying to kill her son so what was the problem, what had forced Akane to such a mood – it was obvious Ryoga lacked the power to kill her son.</p><p>"Kasumi will you speak for your sister's in regard to the engagement?" As the oldest living member of her family she held authority anyway. From what she had heard of Ranma's stay in the household it was best she dealt with Kasumi with Nabiki absent.</p><p>Before Kasumi could gather her thoughts enough to reply Akane interrupted in a lost voice "Would Ryoga really have killed Ranma aunty? How could he do something like that?"</p><p>"Akane, Ryoga is…" Nodoka struggled for words as tears started streaming unnoticed down the lost martial artist's face. It was clear that Akane's world had been drastically changed and that Ryoga's actions had deeply upset and betrayed her but without full knowledge of the situation she was at a loss for how to proceed.</p><p>It was Kasumi however that came to her rescue moving over to wordlessly comfort her sister. No words were necessary; Ryoga's actions and rage had been all the explanation she needed. The death of her father only worsened the uncontrolled emotions that ravaged her psychic, it was a situation that needed to be monitored but she would have her answer from Kasumi regarding her son.</p><p>"It has always been our fathers wish that one of us marry Ranma to unite the schools, originally Akane was chosen to fulfill that role. As he lay dying," Kasumi hiccupped at that trying to regain control over the grief she felt over her father's death, a grief that was made worse by the violent manner in which he was killed.</p><p>"As he lay dying he saw how unhappy Akane was being engaged to Ranma and so he once again widened the agreement to all three of us." Kasumi paused again silently stroking Akane's heir gently calming her younger sister in the same way she had for many years after her mother death. "I can't speak for Nabiki but I realized something earlier, I don't want to die without the opportunity of having children. Starting a family with a man that I loved, whether that turns out to be Ranma or someone else I couldn't say at this moment. But only because I haven't had a chance to really talk to my sister's old fiancé."</p><p>Nodoka sighed in satisfaction at Kasumi's answer, children were very important in the role she would have Ranma assume as soon as possible. If it turned out that Kasumi married Ranma it didn't look like she would have a problem in that area. Akane didn't look like the material she would want to marry her son, or to share in the rule of Jurai. She had withheld judgment before meeting Akane since all the stories she heard about Akane were full of conflict some were complementary and some were not. Now after meeting her it was clear that the third sister had missed out in both brains and maturity.</p><p>"Waaaagghhhh!" the half scream half giggle of the young child Ranma had brought home traveled through the floor from where he was looking after her causing Kasumi to jerk almost displacing Akane before calmly moving her younger sister aside and almost charging downstairs.</p><p>Nadoko shook her head at the young woman's antics as the other fiance's followed her obviously judging the interview with Ranma's mother to be over. It was clear that Kasumi was taken with the child and she could only look forward to her becoming as besotted with her manly son as both Akane and Ukyo were. Ryoko was still a mystery but the self-confessed criminal would never be a serious power broker within the Jurain Empire apart from whatever relationship she held with Ranma. She would have to see what she could do about that.</p><p>Standing up, her thoughts filled with her son, his fiance's and finally possible consequences of his arrival in Jurai, Nadoko followed the young women down stairs.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma slowly glided through a medium level Kata upon the lawns in front of the Tendo Dojo. He didn't want to be within the dojo for what he was doing because he wanted plenty of room and the walls and roof of even as large a dojo as the Tendo Dojo he found constricting. The form of the Kata was something he didn't even have to think about anymore as he slid from stance to stance, young Nanashi in his arms.</p><p>The constant flow and ebb of his Ki flows were as familiar to him as any other part of his body. Following each flow carefully as he took his kata to the air he noticed thick tendrils of power slowly entwining and merging with his Ki. It was these flows, which were causing him so much trouble. When the tendrils of power fully merged with his Ki his attacks were enhanced enormously but whatever it was hadn't finished merging leaving some of his attacks underpowered or over powered with the tendrils at different stages of merging throughout his body. He had no way of telling how much he needed to moderate his attacks in the middle of a fight since the rate at which the power had merged with his Ki altered the strength of his attacks, he would continue having this problem until the unfamiliar power finished merging with his own.</p><p>What was it though he wondered mentally tugging at one of the bright blue threads filling himself with a sense of power and well being as the thread disintegrated and spread evenly throughout his aura. Was it natural? Certainly it didn't feel foreign to his body or evil. Whatever it was felt like it belonged and had been denied the opportunity of merging completely for a long time. Following a hunch he took control of his Ki and forced it to speed up its merging, if nothing else he could then regain control over his attacks and techniques. It was something he needed quickly if her was off to fight the alien invaders.</p><p>Finishing the kata and unconsciously starting another, Ranma monitored his Ki and the strange power mingling together before turning his attention to two other problems he had noticed when scanning his body. Nanashi hadn't even stirred throughout his kata's from where she was sleeping nestled against Ranma's chest, just another challenge to occupy himself with while he considered the two pathways that seemed to have connected themselves to the strange power that was mingling itself with his ki.</p><p>Following one with a carefully constructed Ki probe so as to make sure nothing could backfire and harm him, he was surprised when he struck the Ki of a living being. Or at least he thought it was living since it wasn't anything he was familiar with. Probing deeper he was suddenly struck with a mental image of Ryoko's pet Ryo-okhi eating a carrot. Slightly startled he allowed his probe to crumble and jolted Nanashi awake though not enough to upset her, he continued his kata with a curse promising to ask Ryoko about her pet and why it had linked to him.</p><p>Feeling slightly more confident Ranma rebuilt his ki probe and started to follow the other pathway. Anyone externally attached to his aura had the power to alter behavior and even thoughts if they were powerful enough. He doubted Ryo-okhi had the power or the will to do something like that and he didn't think he had been unduly influenced over the last few months but he had to be sure.</p><p>Frowning at the length of the link he speed up a little, his cautious check no longer so cautious. The pathway had a feeling about it, a feeling of growing strength, the longer it sat there the stronger tie he would have attached to him, Ranma didn't like being tied to anything. His Ki probe once a deft feather was now a thrown brick as he investigated the second connection.</p><p>As suddenly as an image of Ryo-okhi eating a carrot filled his head a feeling of dread flooded his aura. The image of a serpentine western dragon filled his mind causing him to cringe desperately trying to repel the overwhelming dread that filled him. With a roar and a spray of fire the image fled his mind along with the feeling of dread.</p><p>"Waaaagghhhh!" the half scream half giggle of Nanashi broke Ranma out of his shock long enough to realize he had loosened his grip on the child and was about to drop her. Re-firming his grip on the girl child he resumed his interrupted kata with a shake. He didn't know what that other link led to but it made talking to Ryoko much more important. That and finishing the merging of the two powers currently separated within his own aura, focusing on that task he didn't even notice the glittering shimmer that coated him as he lashed out gracefully in an intricate kata of anything goes nor the awe filled faces of the spectators.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Bob Clark watched in detached silence as the last active troops filed into the great concrete bunker that he had called home since the start of the invasion, no one remained surface side – only the dead remained. All wore grieving faces and slouched shoulders that told of low morale. It would be his job to lift the morale of these very troops so that any plan they came up with would not be messed up by lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>"General, how can there be so few troops?" It wasn't really a question that needed answering since they had both heard the testimony of Second Lieutenant Curtis. Still he hoped for some news which he could use to bolster the marole of the troops.</p><p>"Mr president, I think we got off lucky don't you. We are still receiving reports that entire cities are disappearing from the surface of the earth. Not just in America but on all contanents of the world. Thank god for their arrogance since the geospacial statillites are still usefull in tracking the mongrals."</p><p>"Is it arrogance General, I'd say it was well placed confidence. For all our might and technology we managed to kill one, maybe two and that with a sixty percent casualty rate amoung our combat troops, the price on equipment was higher."</p><p>"If you would jus…" the General started in a familiar entreaty to use nuclear weopons. It would probably kill the bastards but then there was no guarentee and he wasn't about to destroy the planet to save it. They had proven to be tough bastards.</p><p>"And then what, say we drop one on each one of those bastards. There are those that say so many nukes going of similtaneously would drastically effect weather paterns, radiation patterns and maybe even tear the ozone layer. Would be satisfied living generations in bunkers like this one, and when they send reinforcements?"</p><p>The General just knodded with a tight smile as if he wasn't serously considering such an action anyway. "It is clear we need to do something, your reports indicate that the main starport is being completed faster than you expected. Then there are the other space ports, reinforcements maybe something we need to fear sooner rather than later."</p><p>"That's correct Mr. President, there has been rumors of UFO sightings above Tokyo, Japan but that hasn't been confirmed. Satilite information is being processed but it is doubtful that anything will be found. If they are willing to leave them in orbit it is clear they think that the satilites will not provide any stategic advantage." Debreifings from the General were always dry and without emotion, if he hadn't known better he would have thought the alien invasion and the eminent distruction of Homo sapiens were a hoax.</p><p>"No doubt you have been working on a secret weapon incase this happened. I know you military types and it is clear from all of this," he gestured at the surrounding concrete structure and other evidence of technology. "That you have always had a plan B, don't tell me that your focus groups never considered the fact that our first encounter with aliens might be hostile. If it was hostile Nukes might not be practice."</p><p>If the General was concerned with Bob's glare he didn't show it, in fact he looked thoughtful. To think he might have kept the knowledge of a weapon that could save humanity a secret while troops and civilians – all his responsibility, died. Bob was starting to dislike his own military, "what is it General."</p><p>"It could make matters more desperate Mr. President, and even if we win it may have similar social consequences as the use of nuclear weapons." That caused Bob Clark to reconsider his first impulse, to go ahead regardless of the consequences. If the General had kept quite all this time and kept quite while some soldiers under his own command died then he probably had given this serious consideration. Now it was his tern to give it full consideration since it ultimately was his decision.</p><p>"Show me," he commandeered still a little annoyed that the general had withheld such important information. When would they learn that he was in charge, "no more secrets?" The general just tilted his head and lead him to an elevator, one that wasn't on the tour. It seemed to go forever, 'how deep does this complex go' he wondered.</p><p>What could this weapon be and how could it cause as great repercussions as fifty 100-kiloton simultaneous nukes worldwide? Then there was the Generals use of 'social consequences,' why had he used that phrase. Knowing the General it was exactly what he had meant to say and held deeper meanings than he could guess.</p><p>The unexpected jolting of the elevator coming to a stop shook the president out of his reverie. Finally he was about to get some answers from the general and perhaps a viewing on what could possibly be more dangerous to humans than the consequences of nuking the alien mongrels.</p><p>Looking eagerly through the slowly opening reinforced steel doors of the elevator Bob sighed in frustration as a guarded booth blocked his view. Walking through the security check with the General he nodded at the soldiers in acknowledgement. His interest lay in the clean room that lay beyond the security check. A large room flooded with illuminating white light filled with large cylindrical tanks of liquid which housed half grown or half eaten humanoid bodies. It was hard to tell which from where he was standing.</p><p>Normally he would have been quick to condemn such scientific study purely on moral ground but the circumstances were extreme. "Your contaminating my lab, quickly come over here." An anxious voice beckoned from a door over to the side of the large room. Bob hadn't even noticed that he had started to approach the tanks for a better look. Following the scientists instructions Bob found himself filled with questions, how was what filled these tanks more dangerous than nuclear warheads.</p><p>"It is an honor Mr. President," the head scientist started. "My name Aloysius and this is my life's work on Homo Vanguard."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"There hasn't been any new communications from the system princess," Ayeka suppressed a worried frown. At the very least Jurai would have broadcast her fleet the result of the battle unless… No she wouldn't think of the alternative. She had only taken half of the fleet with her to Cyon. It was almost impossible to imagine that the invaders could have so easily destroyed them along with Jurai. After all her father was there to command the defense of her home and he commanded the most powerful warship in the empire.</p><p>"We are approaching Jurai now princess," her crew were holding up well despite the possibility they could be walking into a trap. If the invaders had indeed caught her father unaware and destroyed the fleet they could be laying in wait even now. No, must believe that they were in time to save her father and the empire.</p><p>"Fleet assume defensive formation omega. Squad three, be ready to punch through and link up with any surviving defenses. If we are to win this battle we must link up with the remaining forces and rout the invaders between us. We Jurains will not fall so easily." Ayeka gave what she hoped was an inspirational battle cry as jurai came into veiw. "For the glory of Jurai!"</p><p>It was a cry she heard immediately picked up over the comm's by not only her own half of the fleet but also the straggling, pitifully small force that stood between the massive invader fleet and their sweeping destructive beams. Quickly going through all the tactics she thought would be appropriate she made her move. "Squad three follow me, we must meat up with my father. For Squad one, two and four sweep them before you. We will crush this threat here and now."</p><p>Like the well disciplined team she had trained with in the simulator, all soldiers followed her orders without question. They knew of course that there would be casualties but their home and their empire was threatened and they would die to defend it. And perhaps, Tsunami willing they and their empire would survive this day.</p><p>Squad three formed a wedge around her ship and drove deep into the enemies lines. Only the flanking and courageous attacks of the rest of her fleet prevented squad three from being surrounded and destroyed in turn. Silently she counted the ships as they fell, marking there sacrifice but today was not the time to grieve, not when the empire lay on the brink of destruction.</p><p>Just as her fleet and fellow officers were inspired by her steady leadership and the way the tide of battle was flowing the scattered survivors rallied behind her father's great ship. Fighting with renewed vigor, the aggressor's line started to crumble and the enemy ships started to fall in ever greater numbers with fewer casualties.</p><p>With a great roar of triumph over the comm's Squad three linked up with the few remaining survivors, all damaged but their morale remained high due to her timely arrival. "Father!" she shouted as if her could hear her across the vacuum of space "Why can I not see any council motifs, surely they didn't fall so early in the battle." Her voice was laced with triumph and euphoria as the combined fleet of ships turned the battle into a rout.</p><p>"The traitors fled Ayeka just as the tide turned against us, let it be known across Jurai that the Council and their ilk betrayed the Empire leaving the jewel of Jurai to be destroyed in the wake of these unknown and powerfull enemy. Cowards all, let them not share shelter in what remains off our territory."</p><p>Together father and daughter united to save Jurai from the first serious incursion by the enemy. For them and Jurai nothing would be the same again.</p><p>A/N – I am looking for suggestions to book 1 since this finishes it. Aside from suggestions about a title overall comments about the story since now book 1 is finished I will go through and tidy the lot up. All 12 chapters.</p><p>Teal Thanatos suggested keeping Honor Redefined as the book one title and naming book two as Honor Exemplified. Let me know what your ideas are.</p>
