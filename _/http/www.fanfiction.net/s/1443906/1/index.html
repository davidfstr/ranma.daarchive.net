</div>Honor Redefined<p>I would like to thank my beta reader Jesanae Tekani I hope you can all tell the difference. I sometimes thing that beta readers have it harder than authors.<p>Ch1:<p>Untitled<p>Ranma lay back on the tiled rooftop of the Tendo dojo, gazing at the stars as he had done so often in the past. It was a welcome break from the insanity that his life had become. His fiancées rarely bothered him up here, Suon and his old man were usually drunk by this hour and Happosai was always out stealing panties. Time spent up here gave him time to reflect on the direction that his life was taking, and try to find solutions to the mess he found himself in since arriving in Nerima.<p>When he had first arrived in Nerima, it was with some dejection. He and his father had just received their respective curses, and his father, instead of being sympathetic about his curse and helping him look for a cure, just dragged him to some dojo in Tokyo, continuing their seemingly endless training trip.<p>'If it had just been the curse,' Ranma almost groaned, 'I probably would have been able to adapt, given time.' And he had, in a way; despite his father telling him almost all his life that women were stupid and weak, a view that he hadn't been able to refute on his training trip from lack of experience, he had revised his opinion since his arrival in Nerima. There were, he decided, different degrees of weakness.<p>When he turned into a girl, he certainly didn't feel week. Sure, he lost some of his physical strength, but for what he lost in strength he gained in speed-and in some of the fights he had been in, it had been that speed that had been the deciding factor. The curse, he decided, made him a more versatile and adaptable fighter. In fact, if it were just turning into a girl when splashed with cold water, he wouldn't have minded it too much.<p>It was the other part of the curse, the part that caused people to constantly splash him at the most embarrassing times, the part that had Kuno chasing him as a girl and trying to kill him as a guy, and that part that meant he was always having to be on guard against an unexpected splashing and a quick grope by Happosai. No one else was game to risk his ire after seeing him trash Kuno on a daily basis.<p>It wasn't the curse, though, that had him coming up to this very rooftop so frequently. His life had always been strange, and in hindsight the curse was probably always going to have happened to him, a natural progression of chaos. No, what had Ranma coming up to the rooftop thinking and reflecting so often was the state of his honor and integrity.<p>He was honor bound to marry at least three women, to carry on the family school and repay all of the monies stolen by his father to fund their training trip. Ranma wasn't even sure what else he was required to do for the sake of his family's honor; he didn't even know if he had any family other than his father. Certainly his father had avoided any mention of his mother or any possible siblings and or cousins, so, perhaps rightly, Ranma assumed that not only was he the heir to his family's school of martial arts, but the heir to whatever family he had left.<p>Throughout his stay in Nerima he had tried to act as befitted his station as family heir. He had tried to act with honor and integrity, and that was exactly his problem. Somehow he was constantly being manipulated, and when he came up here to think on his actions he didn't always like what he saw. Ranma saw his father, Suon Tendo, his fiancées and rivals manipulating him through his honor; and he saw Cologne, Nabiki and Kasumi manipulating him through his integrity. Once they had started his problems had seemed to spiral out of control, making it easier for them to manipulate him.<p>Staring up at the stars, it seemed so easy to see through their manipulations, and yet he knew that come tomorrow, he would continue to act without thinking things through, continue to make it so easy to be manipulated and continue in the rut that his life had become. 'Damn it, old man, you knew exactly what you were doing when you raised me like that.' It was like, after having been taught how to punch and training his body to be able to instinctually punch that way for ten years, being told that it was in fact the wrong way. Every time he got into a fight he would instinctually use the wrong technique, and that would possibly lose him the fight.<p>That was exactly what seemed to be happening here. At nights he would review the day's events and curse his instinctual foot-in-mouth comments, but he didn't seem to be able to change it, at least not quickly enough. Events in Nerima seemed to ensure it, since whenever things seemed to calm down enough for him to work on changing things, something always interrupted. What he needed was time away from his Nerima and his father. Time away would also be a boon for his martial arts; it had been too long since he had been able to just let loose and push his limits.<p>Despite knowing this, he doubted he would leave-he liked the attention too much, another thing to curse Genma for. He had had so little human contact over the years that he was just enjoying being around people, even if most of his 'friends' wanted to kill him. He was also a little wary about leaving alone; he had always had his father with him, and while he knew that he would be better able to survive without him, it was the unknown that held him back.<p>Ranma sighed again as he refocused on the night sky. It took the light from those stars anywhere from tens of thousands of years to millions of years to reach him here on the rooftop of the Tendo's dojo. Maybe it was knowing that which made it so easy to put his own life in perspective, though he did at times wonder what it would be like having such a unique perspective. It would make things seem so much easier, less intense, viewing things from such a distance. Knowing his luck, if he ever did find out what it was like, then his current problems would be replaced with worse problems, making his current ones seem easier.<p>*****<p>Washu, or Little Washu as she preferred to be known, was currently working in her huge laboratory which, although it was big enough to cover the surfaces of five whole planets, was situated beneath the stairs of the Masaki home. Actually, it was only the door that led to the laboratory that was stationed beneath the stairs. Washu's laboratory was located inside a pocket dimension created by the self-styled greatest scientific mind in the galaxy.<p>No one would dispute the claim, though; minutes spent with the sharp-witted genius would do a lot to convince anyone. Currently she was working on improving the designs of one of her latest creations, the part-mineral, part-organic life form which had established itself as one of the most powerful spaceships in the fleet.<p>When the emperor and his wives had visited, his second wife Funaho had requested that she build them for the sake of galactic security. Seeing the potential for misuse, she had declined, instead assuring Funaho that she would not make any more.<p>She would keep that promise until such time as she was released from it, however that didn't prevent her from exploring possibilities. After all, the greatest scientific genius had to do something to occupy her, and dabbling in intellectual curiosity never hurt anyone.<p>-Bleep-bleep- Washu cursed; one of the sensors that she used to spy on the Masaki home had just gone offline. She shrugged. "Probably Mihoshi's bungling. No one else on this backward planet can so much as detect them, but somehow she accidentally destroys them. I'll fix it later-just a few strands to go and I'll have spliced myself the perfect life form."<p>It didn't bother Washu that every time she had invented something she declared it perfect. In her mind, everything she created was perfect, but her creations couldn't possibly stay perfect. Events were always changing and life would become incredibly boring if nothing she made ever required perfecting to fit current events.<p>As Washu once again lost herself in her work, forgetting the sensor that went off line, something important was taking place. It was an event that would change the fate of the Jurian Empire, and by the time she remembered, it would be too late-far too late.<p>*****<p>Tenchi watched in disbelief as his blood pooled out from where he had slumped after the fight with the …thing. Although it was humanoid in shape, he had enough experience with Washu to safely say that not everything that was humanoid was human. The fact that it looked and fought more like a shadow was a dead giveaway. He had managed to hit it once during the fight, and he had expected his Jurian sword to slice it in two like everything else he had hit with it.<p>That had not happened. It was almost as if his sword had been blunted. The shock of seeing the tenchi-ken so ineffective was enough to make him pause. Seeing what he had previously thought as almost an unbeatable weapon stopped with such ease was enough for him to become distracted in the fight. That distraction was all that was needed for his apponent, his killer to be able to slice a hole in his torso the size of watermelon. He had lost. Tenchi couldn't believe it; he had beaten Kagato and with the help of the girls, and Dr. Clay as well.<p>He had been extremely confident that he would be able to handle any threat that came his way. After all, if by any chance his impressive skills with the Tenchi-ken and the light hawk wings failed him, there was always a super-powered space pirate, a princess of Jurai and her guardians, and the greatest scientific mind in the galaxy-and if by any chance *they* all failed, there was Tsunami.<p>Tenchi felt he had reason to feel confident. Now, though, it was all he could do to ignore the pain. He had lost; somehow, he had been ambushed and either the others had been unable to come to his aid, or were unaware of his situation as he fought for his life.<p>It had been all up to him and he had lost, possibly opening up the way for the attacker to proceed to attack the household. He had failed in his quest to protect the girls-he had failed.<p>Tenchi's last hope was that someone would find him in time to give him one last chance at life. No one did.<p>*****<p>Azusa stared sadly at the holographic image of the Milky Way. The image was an awesome sight, detailing around 400 billion stars, along with thousands of clusters and nebulae. The model was too small for him too make out each individual detail, but he knew that they were there.<p>He watched as the six galactic arms that made up the spiral galaxy slowly rotated around the relatively large, bulbous formation that made up the Galactic Center. It was truly inspiring knowing that the Jurian empire stretched from the tip of the Cygnus arm, on the very edge of the spiral galaxy, to a spot well into the Orion arm.<p>Azusa, despite being the emperor to such a huge empire, couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the vastness of space. Sure, his empire spanned over thirty thousand light years, but the Milky Way alone stretched over one hundred thousand light years, and the galaxy in which they had made their home was only one out of many. Originally his family and those of the other three royal families had fled from a neighboring galaxy to make their own here in the milky way.<p>It was a testament to their strength and determination that there empire, which had started of so small. Had flourished and after ten thousand years spanned the stars to what it was today. He had received some troubling news though and in an attempt to reflect on what could well turn into a major incident Asuza had been drawn to the model, which was housed inside his palace on Jurai. Word was that one of colonial worlds on the edge of the empire had been bombed to oblivion. Normally the galaxy police would have dealt with such a matter; after all, it was in their jurisdiction.<p>The colony in question was the latest of a series of pushes by colonists settling further and further away from the central authority of Jurai. While this had the advantage of a greater level of self-government, it also held the threat of a lesser presence of galactic law enforcement. This made them a favorite target for space pirates and other terrorist activities.<p>It wasn't always space pirates or terrorists that provided a threat to new colonies, however, but also space itself. The galaxy was not always the safe place that his government led people to believe. Meteorites, gas clouds, super-sonic dust clouds, and intense bursts of radiation caused by supernovae had wiped out their fair number of colonies before and would continue to do so. A colony was very vulnerable to those kinds of threats early in its lifetime, at least until a fair amount of technology could be built, anyway.<p>He and the rest of the galaxy police had assumed that the latest colony located on the far edges of the Cygnus arm had been a victim of such an event. It wasn't until the galaxy police and a team of scientists descended upon the former colony that they had discovered that it had been, in fact, bombed.<p>What really had him and the council worried was what else they had found in their investigation. A large concentration of Tau neutrinos was evident above the planet. Such a large concentration, so long after the destruction of the colony, suggested an enormous concentration at the time of the colony's demise.<p>The scientists who discovered the presence of the neutrinos also speculated that they had been produced, rather than naturally occurring. The implications of that supposition were staggering; the news that someone was going around bombing colonies would shake the foundations of the empire.<p>Worse, news that they had a hold of some technology that wasn't known to law enforcement would spark fear. After all people felt secure knowing that the government had the biggest guns with which to protect its civilians with. If it was discovered that the galaxy police hadn't even been aware that it was occurring, then people's faith in him to protect them would start to falter, being that he was ultimately responsible for such a calamity.<p>What made it worse, though, was that the council was using this very opportunity to increase their power and standing, at the expense of putting forward a united front with him to reassure the people, or at least the people that were allowed to know such things.<p>Azusa almost growled when the door burst open, interrupting his brooding; he quickly cut off any objections at the sight of Misaki running into the room. "Waaahhhh, it's terrible!" she cried as she dove into his embrace. He shook his head as she started mumbling incoherently against his chest; he loved his first wife dearly, but sometimes she found the most inopportune times to require comforting.<p>When his second wife Funaho walked in, he knew something was wrong. Misaki interrupted him all the time-it was the way she was, and he loved her for it. Funaho only interrupted him when it was important; she had a great political mind and was invaluable for smoothing over squabbles between the galaxy police, academy and the council. That wasn't to say that he didn't love his second wife, just that she was very different from Misaki.<p>"Azusa, we must recall Yosho and the princesses from Earth."<p>"But, dear," he almost whined over the top of Misaki's head, "I've already tried to persuade them. Yosho is adamant and the girls won't leave Tenchi. Besides," he continued in a gruffer tone, "you know as well as I do that the education they are receiving on earth will benefit them greatly when it becomes their turn to rule. The risk with the latest attack on one of our colonies doesn't change my mind about that."<p>"Azusa, Tenchi has been assassinated. I doubt the girls will object to returning now and the council demands an heir. Between the bombing and the assassination we have a plot, one that stretches the length of the empire and that we cannot ignore."<p>Azusa sighed and once again glanced at the scaled down model of the Milky Way. "Very well. Recall them and increase the alertness of the guards; until the threat has passed, it will indeed be safer on Jurai."<p>*****<p>A/N  -For the Tenchi universe I have only seen the OAV's, so that is what I'll be following. The other universes are a little different.<p>- for information on the Milky Way, an excellent source is .org/~<p>- for those non-physicists, information on neutrinos is found at ./~
