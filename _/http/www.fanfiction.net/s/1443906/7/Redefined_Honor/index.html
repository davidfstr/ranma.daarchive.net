</div>Honour Redefined<p>WSRaptor really did a number on this one.<p>Thanks man, I'll keep writing as long as people keep reading.<p>Aleh - Jurai is invaded and on its way to being destroyed and Tenchi is dead, how can I maintain continuity from the series after that happened. I believe that is why its called a divergence.<p>To everyone - All through Ranma ½, it was a common theme that everyone jumped to conclusions about Ranma. That's the point when it came to assuming that Ranma did something, its not that they weren't smart just that when it came to Ramna the NWC was all to ready to jump to the wrong conclusion.<p>Ch7: When shit hits the fan<p>The early morning sun reflected off the silverish blade that was being wielded by the shadow hypnotically. Not that Ranma noticed this, he was too busy trying to avoid the lethal edge that was trying its best to cut him to notice the deadly beauty of it.<p>From the first moments of the fight, the heavily sweating Ranma knew that he was in trouble. Not only was his opponent very fast but it was also wielding an extremely sharp sword with deadly intent.<p>Since the shadowy figure had first lunged at him, he had lost track of Ryoko. He could not afford even a moment's distraction. Ranma was also unsure how badly Shampoo and Cologne were hurt, but he wouldn't be doing anybody any good if he was distracted and killed now. Ryoko was good but having fought her he doubted she could have held up as long as even he could and besides he couldn't stand the thought of anyone fighting his fights for him. It was obvious that this blade wielding shadow was after him.<p>Why was this figure out to kill him? Sure, plenty of people had wanted to humiliate, beat him up, or even seriously maim him but to his knowledge no one had seriously wanted to kill him. Ranma cursed as he was further unbalanced from avoiding a lethal series of strikes. If this fight were to continue this way, he would be in even more trouble than he was now.<p>He could detect no usable aura being emitted from his opponent. That ruled out the use of the Hiryu Shoten Ha. Heck, even the frequent and draining use of Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken had failed to gain him any advantages. Ranma was becoming increasingly desperate and fearful for his friends' life as well as his own.<p>There had to be something that he could use to alter the course of this fight. Ranma Saotome never lost when it counted and it most definitely counted now. His training had put him in good stead for this fight by boosting his stamina and speed enormously, but it wasn't enough. He was still losing...badly.<p>Ranma back flipped over a crater, putting some distance between him and the dancing shadow. After he had stepped on a loose rock, he had to momentarily regain his balance before he was once again fighting for his life. The answer, he felt, lay not in the physical training he had done, but in his chi and aura training. The understanding of self that was so important for a master of the art.<p>Letting himself smirk confidently, Ranma loosened his hold on his aura. If he could achieve that new level he had felt himself approaching lately, then the fight was as good as over. Already he was actively using his battle aura to strengthen his ki paths, but it wasn't enough. What he needed was something decisive.<p>Grinning like a madman, Ranma once again leapt away from his foe. He needed a little time to set this up and if he took too long, then this shadowy figure would no doubt take his blade to the wounded. Using the trees that were still standing around the clearing as springboards, Ranma bounced around the figure. Besides providing him the time he needed there was also the chance that he could disorientate his opponent.<p>Using his battle aura internally, he could monetarily boost his speed, strength and stamina. He had seen Happosai, Cologne and more recently Ryoko do things he had previously thought impossible manipulating their chi externally. Until recently though he hadn't been able to invest the time required to develop or at least adapt some of his own techniques.<p>Over the last two weeks of training he had been unsuccessful in his attempts. It required more effort than he had thought, but today he felt that this was what was needed to win. Today, he would have to develop his first technique if he were to win this fight. Ranma shied away from thinking about what else might be required to win instead he concentrated on surviving this fight for his sake and the sake his friends.<p>Keeping a careful eye on the shadow in the increasingly illuminated clearing Ranma started gathering his aura in a solid blue ball, then with a cry of effort he thrust the ball towards the middle of the clearing. Immediately launching himself closely behind his released ball of chi he watched as the shade seemed to flicker upon its impact. Not giving it any time to recover from the impact he attacked in with renewed vigour.<p>He didn't take long to realise his mistake though. Ranma felt exhausted, barely able to continue the fight as he dodged and weaved with a greater desperation. Ranma cursed as he stumbled over one of the many small craters that dotted the clearing. He just hoped that he had slowed it down enough for Ryoko to be able to finish it off. Looking up as the shadow brought its gleaming blade to bear Ranma waited for the end. Ranma doubted that his screaming muscles would respond fast enough to avoid the shade's final thrust.<p>He was very surprised when a glowing yellow shaft of light seemed to pierce the chest of the figure. He barely rolled out of the way of the falling blade, dropped as the shadows grip loosened. The shadow seemed to dissipate in the sunlight, leaving only his blade as evidence that he was ever there. Ryoko gave him a sad smile before stumbling away crying. He was sure he heard something about Tenchi amongst her sobbing, but was too relieved at being alive to mind. He was also preoccupied by the thought of his part in the death of a fellow martial artist.<p>Ignoring his screaming muscles, he got up to check on the amazons. Ranma could deal with wounded martial artists, but a girl grieving for the death of a loved one was still outside of his experience.<p>*****<p>Nodoka strode through the greenery of Hokkaido, following up on the rumours of a group of martial artists. Certainly the sound of a distant and ferocious battle ahead had vindicated the rumours she had heard. The question was whether her son was a part of that group. Certainly, he may have joined up temporally with other skilled martial artists as part of his training.<p>Stepping into a clearing, she immediately drew her sword as she tried to take in what lay before her. Nodoka stared at the crater pitted clearing and the sobbing girl in the corner. Her eyes narrowed as they brushed past a beaten and bloody body of an elderly woman and what looked to be her unconscious granddaughter being accosted by a healthy looking young man.<p>Drawing what seemed to be an obvious conclusion from the beaten elder, the unconscious girl and the young woman sobbing in the corner of the isolated and scarred clearing she charged in shouting, "Get away from her you animal!" The young man whirled around obviously startled that someone had interrupted his evil actions. Despite being surprised, he expertly avoided a slashing by her finely honed katana.<p>Allowing him to draw her away from the unconscious bodies of the young woman and her grandmother she continued to press him. His obvious exhaustion just confirmed her interpretation of events. "Just my luck another crazy chick after my blood," she heard him mumble between dodging her strikes which she found to be annoyingly ineffective.<p>Still, she felt that it was just a matter of time before she broke his defenses. He was obviously not at his fighting peak. Nodoka smiled grimly as she heard her sword rip through the sleeve of his shirt. Monsters such as this had no right to exist.<p>As she pressed the youth in front of her with her sword skills she did not see the young woman stop crying and produce a glowing sword of energy. So she remained ignorant of the very real and deadly threat from that direction. Nodoka by this stage was too wrapped up by her own sense of righteousness to even believe that there was a threat from any other direction but the one she was facing. The youth that she was fighting had noticed though and quickly decided that any misunderstandings needed to be cleared up before someone else was killed that day.<p>It surprised her then that she was so easily disarmed moments after she had scored such a close hit effectively reversing the fortunes of those fighting. The move that he had used to disarm her somehow reminded her of something but before she could think on such matters the youth interrupted her by saying, "Now perhaps you could explain why you attacked me?"<p>Nodoka glanced between the young man and her family katana judging her chances of regaining her weapon. "Lady, I will not hesitate to render you unconscious if you go for that sword without first explaining yourself." He sounded sure of himself despite the large tear in his sleeve. Recalling the speed and accuracy he had used to disarm her, even with his obvious exhaustion, she could understand why he was so sure of himself.<p>Growling in frustration, she turned to face the young man feeling much more insecure without her sword by her side. "I saw what you were trying to do to that young lady..." she said gesturing towards the unconscious purple haired girl "...and I can only guess what you did to that poor girl." Nodoka glanced poignantly towards where the sobbing girl to had sat on one side of the damaged clearing. She just blinked when she saw the girl no longer crying but instead armed and facing her with obviously hostile intent.<p>She was again taken by surprised when the black haired, pigtailed youth just turned and walked away towards a fallen tree. "What's with it with people jumping to conclusions and attacking without understanding the situation?" he asked himself disgustedly as he started rummaging through a pile of fallen branches to the side of the clearing.<p>"Sit and I will explain," the youth commanded pointing towards a tree stump. The stump was not too far from where he was searching for something amongst the rubble but it was further away from her family blade. "Collect your katana if you must but do not attack me again or I will not go so easy on you."<p>Grumbling, she did what she was instructed to do. She felt safer with her sword in her hand even though she had been so easily defeated with it by the young man in front of her. Still, she had achieved what she had set out to do. He had stopped accosting the poor girl though by know she was questioning what she had really seen. "Ryoko she's not likely to attack me again," as he addressed the girl she relaxed considerably returning to her slumped position in the corner.<p>"We are all traveling martial artists," he started. "We'd been training for a little over two weeks when we were attacked by a very formidable challenger. Even though we had superior numbers we only just barely drove him off. Even you can see the damage we took." The young man gestured towards his companions, "I was just checking to see how seriously they were hurt, that's all."<p>The pigtailed grunted as he pulled a large pack from underneath some solid looking branches. He proceeded to pull bandages and other first aid items from what must have been one of his emergency kit.<p>"Now please tell me who you are and WHY YOU ATTACKED ME!" Nodoka blinked and felt her previous insecurities return. She had attacked him with little or no warning and he had still defeated her effortlessly. This was not someone she wanted as an enemy. "I thought..." she started. He deserved an apology for her misjudgment and an explanation wouldn't go amiss either.<p>He was obviously just caring for his friends and companions. It must have been a fearsome fight judging from the mess they had made of the clearing. Nodoka watched as he started patching up the purple haired girls without embarrassment.<p>"I have to apologise. I jumped to conclusions. Please let me help you with that." While she didn't expect instant forgiveness, she didn't expect her help to be rebuffed either and besides judging from the youth's level of skill he didn't have to worry about her attacking him anytime soon.<p>"Fine. If you could start a fire and boil some water," the youth grunted. "These wounds will heal better if they are cleaned. You will find everything you'll need in the pack over there," he said nodding towards the pack he had recovered the bandages from.<p>Nodoka nodded and started to make herself useful. Introductions could wait she decided until after the injured martial artists were cared for. By then, she hoped that she would have figured out that disarming move the boy had used.<p>*****<p>Cologne sat up with a start and almost wished she hadn't. Every joint in her aged body was shrieking and her muscles still felt overstretched. But she wasn't dead which meant that someone had dealt with whatever it was that had attacked their campsite. Cologne shook her head in disgust to think that 3000 years of Amazon martial experience had been so easily overcome. It boggled the mind.<p>"Your awake elder," a familiar male voice commented as she suppressed a shudder. If son-in-law had dealt with it he would never let her live it down. "Shampoo is still out of it but should make a full recovery." Looking around she could see herself and her granddaughter propped up against a tree stump in front of a blazing fire. The bubbling pot reminded her just how much energy that fight had taken out of her. Beside them were Ranma, a sleeping Ryoko and a red haired lady who bore a remarkable resemblance to son-in-law's girl side.<p>"That's good to know Ranma but would you mind telling me what happened and who she is," she managed to croak out. She wouldn't tell anyone but at that moment she was glad for the support the stump provided.<p>"Not much to tell really. Me and Ryoko double teamed it." Ranma answered modestly without really revealing anything about the fight. "This lady here showed up after and offered to help. You've all been out of it most of the day. When everyone's up there will be time for introductions." Cologne looked up at the setting sun. 'Try all day son-in-law' she thought acidly. She hadn't been defeated this badly since she was a young warrior. She had been too comfortable. She had been relying too much on the superiority of her Amazonian techniques and her own vast experience. As soon as she healed she needed to do some training of her own.<p>Ranma started dishing out extra large servings of the stew from the pot. He laughed as Shampoo stirred. "Shampoo must have a stomach like mine to time that so closely," he commented.<p>Shampoo just blinked as she accepted the bowl. "What Ranma doing and who she?" she asked as she began to practically inhale her meal.<p>"Someone whose better at cooking than I am," he replied as he started to devour his own serving.<p>"Your last name wouldn't happen to be Saotome would it?" demanded the red haired lady to Ranma's right.<p>"Could we wait until after the meal for you to challenge me?" asked Ranma tiredly while serving himself another bowl from the pot. "I can't really offer you whatever Genma promised you either."<p>The red headed woman made a move towards Ranma announcing, "Ranma, I'm your mother." Before she could get much closer however an angry yellow bar of energy blocked her.<p>"Earlier today you tried to kill him. I suggest you watch your actions"" Ryoko, the Teal haired brawler had jumped to Ranma's defense. Ranma just continued eating showing neither shock or worry over the woman's outburst or at Ryoko coming to his defense. Cologne guessed that recent events really had desensitized him from strange happenings. One thing she knew though, life with son-in-law was definitely going to get stranger.<p>*****<p>Azusa watched the Vengeance as it drifted out of the space docks of Rukuubi. He had to admire the sleek design of The Vengeance despite her monstrous size. She was the first of a whole line of star ships that he hoped would put the current conflict on a more even footing.<p>What marked the Vengeance as unique though wasn't its monstrous size or its unusually sleek design but its fire power. The weapons and shields on this beauty were based on the experimental designs, which had been demonstrated to him earlier that week by his scientific advisors. At his behest both the scientist and the engineers had been working non-stop until she had been finished. Now he was he was glad he had insisted so strenuously. She would boost the moral of the Jurian fleet, which had sunk dangerously low.<p>Azusa just hoped that the Vengeance lived up to expectations and gave a much-needed break to both of his daughters. They had lived up to their positions these past weeks but they were still children. Neither Ayeka nor Sasami deserved to have their childhood stolen by war, yet it was already too late for that.<p>He knew that the death of Tenchi had scarred them both terribly and the demands of state when they had returned had not helped. Like him though they were both worried about Yosho and the inaction at the front. Ships that crossed the invisible line that had once marked the boundary between the core of his empire and the colony worlds did not return. Equally, no new incursions into the core were evident.<p>So why was he so worried? He had his military advisors telling him that they could only be building up for a final assault upon Jurai but he suspected that something much more sinister was going on. The not knowing frustrated him.<p>Still if it was just a build up, the invading ships would find what it meant to take on a fully woken Jurian empire. His industrial worlds were finally working at full potential with drones scouring for minerals in the many asteroid belts that abounded the galaxy. Before long, he would have whole armadas of ships that matched the Vengeance in capabilities. He had his scientists working frantically with his liaison from the industrial sector so what was he missing?<p>It was something obvious but the answer eluded him. As his empire ground out on a war footing he couldn't help but suspect that something more would be needed to win this war than just technological advantage or strength of arms.<p>But what?<p>*****<p>Bob Clarke smiled at the cameras as he bounced an infant on his knee. This was what won elections. The emotional scenes and catch cries that appealed to the American pop culture of the day. He didn't like to demean his fellow countrymen but the average American didn't really have the attention span to differentiate between policies, particularly when they were so similar.<p>Bob tried not to wrinkle his nose as he smilingly passed the young child to one of the nurses. One of the hazards of nursing young children he guessed. He had been in the Special Forces and had led missions all over the world against terror cells. How, he wondered had he ended up here?<p>Even as he silently asked himself that question a twitch in his knee answered him. That particular wound had ended his career in the forces and started his career in politics. Being disillusioned by what he saw as career politicians fumbling foreign policy in an increasingly hostile environment he had decided to act.<p>Acquiring a political advisor and pushing his military credentials, showing off his war wound his popularity soared. In fact it soared so much that he had been elected, a major win for the Republican Party. He had so far avoided any scandals that so often marked presidents first terms foiling any re-election plans they might have had and so far his own re-election campaign seemed to be going smoothly. Mingling with the crowd of parents and childcare workers Bob made small talk, enhancing his image as a man of the people. It wasn't something that came naturally to him though. Making small talk with the average American was a skill that he had to acquire. It was a skill that a life in the military had not prepared him for.<p>The rumble of military helicopters distracted him from the conversation he was having with a group of his constituents. It had been years but he could still pick up the difference between standard military issue and commercial class 'copters, SH-2 Seasprite's unless he missed his guess.<p>Bob tilted his head to the side ignoring the cameras. There was more than one, maybe as many as 10 and they were coming in low and fast. It wasn't a sound that he had heard for years, but it wasn't one that he could easily forget.<p>He started to walk in the direction of the nearest open field. It was where they would most likely land in preparation for whatever operation they had planned. The media all turned towards the impressive site of a fleet of helicopters zeroing in on their position as they came into site over the skyline. Something big must have happened for such an operation to be launched.<p>Bob watched expressionlessly as the helicopters landed in formation and spewed armoured troops. He had seen it all before. His eyes followed the leaders of the assault group as they approached him and saluted. "Mr. President sir, we have a code blue invasion on home soil. You need to come with us sir." He had not been out of the military long enough to forget what a code blue invasion was. Nodding, he approached the nearest Seasprite ignoring the surrounding troops as they enclosed around him and loaded into the surrounding vehicles.<p>The camera's continued rolling as the president left with the fleet of helicopters and the small army of men. All those present thought that what they had just witnessed was front line news. Something that would be reported on worldwide.<p>They were wrong.<p>*****<p>Nabiki sat facing the group of martial artists that had joined her in search of Ranma. They were all getting frustrated which didn't provide the safest place for Nabiki to be. "Ranma said that he would return to Nerima when he had finished training. With the luck were having finding him, he'll return before we do." Nabiki addressed the crowd calmly ignoring her gnawing conscience whenever she thought of Nodoka's reaction to her story.<p>Nodoka didn't attack her, she wasn't accused of everything and no punishment seemed to be forthcoming from the woman on Ranma's behalf. In fact, Nodoka had seemed calm and relaxed when she had left in search of Ranma herself. Only the fact that Genma had also disappeared had hinted that Nodoka had not taken it as well as she had appeared to.<p>"How dare that IDIOT hide from us," growled out Akane as she rapidly lost control of her anger.<p>"Small wonder he didn't leave sooner honey, having to see you every day." Ukyo just sniped from out of reach of Akane's infamous mallet.<p>"Akane!" the party turned in surprise as Ryoga stumbled onto their camping site. "I found Ranma. He was cheating on you with other women." Ryoga was gasping as if he had run from wherever he had found Ranma.<p>"So where did you find him Ryoga?" Nabiki asked before Akane could charge of in another tantrum. It had already happened a number of times through their search.<p>"It had to be Hokkaido," he gasped out just before he collapsed from exhaustion. "He should still be there if we hurry."
