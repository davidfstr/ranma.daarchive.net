</div>Insertion<p>Part 41<p>The Sub-Zero Program<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma found himself standing in the Cat Café. The building was shut down, all the doors were closed and it had a sort of dark ambience about it.<p>"What the hell is this?" he muttered as he frowned at Cologne.<p>The old woman was sitting patiently at one of the tables in the middle of the room. "I see you received my note."<p>"You mean this?" asked Ranma as he held up the note. "Something about settling this little engagement?"<p>"Yes, in a way," said the old woman as she nodded. "I have an offer that even you cannot refuse."<p>"Oh?" asked Ranma as he arched his eyebrow and sat down across from her. "I suppose it must be good, considering you closed the place for this."<p>"Indeed," said Cologne.<p>"Well, let's get down to it then," said the boy as he smiled at her for a moment.<p>"Very well. I am willing to offer you an entire tribe of women," said Cologne.<p>Ranma blinked. "Pardon?"<p>"That child of yours, she is more powerful than any child of that age should be. I believe it is because you are her father."<p>Ranma nodded at this, unsure of what to say.<p>"I am prepared to allow something that has never been allowed a male. Every woman in the tribe will be yours," she said with a smirk growing on her face.<p>"Oh?" he said with a smirk of his own forming.<p>"Indeed, you will not be asked to work, the rest of your life will be luxury. All that we ask, is that you supply the next generation of Amazon women," said the old woman calmly.<p>Ranma didn't speak, but leaned back in his chair for a moment.<p>"I'm not sure if you know this, but because of Jusenkyo, you can only sire female children," she said with a short nod.<p>"I figured," he snorted casually. "No big loss there I suppose."<p>That statement caught Cologne off guard. She regained her composure quickly and nodded. "Indeed, that makes you all the more valuable to us."<p>"Well, it is an interesting offer, but no," said Ranma as he looked at her.<p>Cologne blinked. "No?"<p>"Yeah. No," he said with a shrug.<p>"You're refusing me?"<p>"Ha! How stupid do you think I am?" snorted Ranma.<p>"I beg your pardon?" said Cologne in disbelief.<p>"I'm no fool. You expect me to turn into some sort of lazy baby machine. When the daughters I give you grow old enough, and or I grow fat and weak enough, you'll use them to put me in my place. Ha! You're the fool, I've no intention of living in some barn, growing fat and old while you shove a woman in on me every few days or so."<p>Cologne frowned; he was surprisingly accurate in his accusations.<p>"Please don't insult me. It goes against everything your tribe stands for to serve some man that way. I wouldn't do it based on principal alone. Besides, I'm a Saiyan Warrior, what makes you think I'd want such a laid back and easy life?" He leaned foreword and stared at her fearlessly.<p>"You don't know what you're passing up," she said calmly.<p>"I know exactly what I'm passing up," he replied.<p>"Saiyan Warrior? I don't know of this term. Tell me what sort of clan is this?"<p>Ranma grinned and sat back again. "What would you say, if I told you that I wasn't human?"<p>Cologne stared at him for a moment in silence. Everything seemed to make sense in her mind now. "What are you?"<p>"I'm an alien," he said as he stood up and uncoiled his tail from around his waist. "Neat huh?"<p>"This is..."<p>"Yeah. I know. I like you old woman, so I think I'll trust you with this," he said as he gave her an amused look. "Cross me, and your tribe won't live to regret it."<p>"You overestimate your power boy," snapped Cologne.<p>"Please, I could destroy this whole planet if I wanted to," he replied. "I've done it before."<p>"What?" gasped Cologne as she stared at him.<p>"It's not something I'm planning on doing again. It's caused me all sorts of trouble," he snorted and shrugged his shoulders.<p>Cologne looked him straight in his eyes, there was no lie hidden in them. Only an icy cold confidence stared back at her. "What is it that you want?"<p>"Nothing. Like I said, despite your rather comical attempts to trap me, I rather like you. I'm a powerful ally."<p>Cologne nodded slowly. "I see."<p>"I wouldn't live in the shadow of any woman, and I don't expect my daughters to live in the shadow of any man," he continued. "Not that there are any who could force them too."<p>"What are you suggesting then?" asked Cologne carefully.<p>"Well, Shampoo is a very nice girl, but I'm afraid I'm spoken for. My daughters wouldn't be of any use to you either. Neither of them would enjoy life in a quiet Chinese village much. I suggest you and I form a sort of friendly relationship."<p>Cologne nodded at this.<p>"There are a lot of nasty things in China, people who wouldn't like your little village much," he said calmly. "If you drop this whole engagement thing. I'll make sure your tribe continues to exist for another three thousand years."<p>Cologne frowned for a moment. "How can you do this?"<p>"I already almost control this country, it's only a matter of time before the world follows," he said with a small snort. "I also have a lot of important friends, and some very powerful allies."<p>Cologne snorted. "You control this country? That seems a bit arrogant my boy."<p>"Everyone knows that the Men in Black is the best security money can buy. The best way to protect your secrets. All of your most important secrets." Ranma grinned at her again, it was a slightly disturbing smile at that.<p>"What do you mean?" she said as she looked at him for a moment.<p>"I'm the owner of the most powerful security force in Japan," he said with a shrug. "I've been using it to gather information, establish relationships, poke things my way."<p>Cologne nodded at this. "I see. You're cleverer than I thought. Perhaps a bit too clever."<p>"Perhaps," he admitted. "I'll admit that I'm not doing this on my own. I've got a few partners, but they all answer to me."<p>"I begin to see why you refused my offer," said the old woman.<p>"I'd have refused it regardless. I'm not someone's breeding stock," he said with a wry looking grin. He seemed almost playful at the moment.<p>"You claim that you can ensure my tribe's survival?" she said as she smirked at him. "We've been doing it for three thousand years."<p>"And you're on the brink of extinction," said Ranma. "Your methods are outdated, your weapons obsolete. Your people are fading away."<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes at this.<p>Ranma ignored her and continued. "Your tribe's survival depends on people not noticing you. Your bribes and arranged marriages will only protect you so much. If the wrong person notices your little mountain paradise..."<p>"What would you know?" she snapped.<p>"I've been watching you, and your tribe for some time now," he said calmly.<p>"Spying on us?" snapped Cologne.<p>"You think I'm the only one?" he replied calmly.<p>Cologne sat down and stopped talking. "Who?"<p>"The Chinese Government," replied the boy with a shrug. "As of yet, there's been no real advantage to removing you. Your countries growing population will quickly change that. In a few years time, you could become a threat. Possibly influencing the greater population. Your tribe's reclusive attitude is the only reason you're still around."<p>Cologne hung her head and said nothing for a long moment. "You say you can stop this?"<p>"I could probably do it by force if I had to, but I'd rather not. You're safe enough for a few years. By that time, I'll be able to do it with more subtlety."<p>"I see. Assuming you don't get yourself killed," she replied.<p>"I doubt that. My daughter came back through time to see me," he replied calmly.<p>"You spoke of another?" said Cologne as she looked up at him again.<p>"Yes, her name is Ryoko," said the boy with a shrug. "She's the result of a trip to the past I took about a week ago."<p>"So, she is..."<p>"An adult," said Ranma with a short nod.<p>Cologne closed her eyes and sat in silence once again for a long moment. She made a small growling noise and looked at Ranma again. "Very well. I shall nullify the Kiss of Marriage."<p>Ranma smirked and turned towards the door. "I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got places to be."<p>"So it seems," said Cologne as she sat in the dark after he left and lit her pipe. "Most interesting."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Belldandy, I've found something weird," said Skuld as she glanced up from the computer screen and looked at her older sister.<p>The older Goddess was cleaning the room, dusting cheerfully. She paused and looked at her little sister for a moment. "What is it Skuld?"<p>"I've never seen this program before. It's almost like a bug, but the system says it belongs here," she said as she moved over so Belldandy could see.<p>"What is it?" asked the older goddess as she peered at the screen. "Oh my! How odd."<p>The screen had several lines of code on it. "Sub-zero initiated. Target Located: Midigard. Initializing system for program parameters."<p>"What is this?" asked Skuld.<p>"I've never seen that program before," said Belldandy. "We'll have to ask Urd about it when she returns."<p>+++++++++++<p>"Stupid Keiichi," grumbled Urd as she walked down the sidewalk with a plastic bag on her arm. She had just returned from the store and now had two large bottles of sake. The glass clinked together loudly as she walked. "He knows I have to have something like this around, but he never buys enough."<p>She paused in the middle of the street as an explosion rocked the entire block. Several men in dark suits ran screaming out of the remains of a small store. Their clothes were on fire, and they screamed as they fell to the ground and rolled around on the pavement.<p>"My store!" cried the shopkeeper as he looked on in horror from just outside.<p>A figure dressed in a dark trench coat stood next to him, grinning from ear to ear. He had a bald green head with a mouth much too large to be human. "Well. Look at the bright side. At least you don't have to pay them for protection anymore." The green headed thing lowered a bazooka from his shoulder and tossed it aside casually. He turned towards the Yakuza who were still trying to put out the flames by rolling around. "Oh! Fire, fire!" he cried. "Quick! Someone put the fire out!" He vanished into thin air.<p>A moment later, a fire truck rounded the corner, the sirens blaring loudly as it barreled down the street and ran over all of the burning men. "Oops. Little too much gas," commented the thing as it reversed and rolled over them again. The thing then jumped out of the truck, wearing a fireman's uniform. He turned on the hose and turned it towards the bodies of the men, putting out the flames and blowing them around on the street from the high pressure.<p>Urd growled and backed away. "Loki!"<p>The thing paused and turned towards her, the mad looking grin still present on its face. "Well, there's a face I haven't seen in a while." The features on the thing's face changed, appearing to almost stretch out into another head. It looked at the goddess and walked up to her. "Hello Urd."<p>"Get back," she said as she frowned at it.<p>"Or you'll what? Destroy me? Maybe break this mask, and release me from my prison?" sneered the god as he looked at her.<p>"I can't lift your punishment, and you know it," she spat.<p>"If you could, I'd have tricked you into doing it by now. Tell me, how are things?"<p>"None of your damn business," snapped Urd as she turned away.<p>"Oh. Come now. Don't be that way! It's not often I get to speak with another of my kind. It's lonely down here on Midigard all by myself."<p>"What do you want?" she snapped.<p>"Nothing important. I'm just waiting for the big show to start," sneered the thing as it leered at her.<p>Urd paused, adjusting her bag on her arm. "What show?"<p>"Oh! You don't know yet?" he said with an amused chuckle.<p>"Spit it out creep," she snapped.<p>"Okay, fine. Someone has activated the Sub-Zero program," said the god merrily.<p>"What?" gasped Urd in shock.<p>"The only way to stop it, is to destroy what's causing it," said the thing cheerfully. "I know what it is, but it wouldn't be any fun to tell you."<p>"Where?" snapped Urd.<p>"Why, on Midigard of course," said Loki.<p>"That's not possible!" said the Goddess. "You're lying!"<p>"Why would I do that? Especially when the truth is so much fun!" said Loki as he faded back into the mask's face again. He laughed madly and vanished.<p>Urd dropped her bag, completely forgetting about it as she rushed towards a nearby electronics store. Not caring who saw her, she dove into one of the televisions.<p>"Wow. When you said you'd be completely immersed in the picture you meant it," said one of the customers who stood next to a dumbfounded salesman.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma frowned as he stood on the steps of the Masaki Shrine. Chibi-Usa stood beside him and looked around.<p>"Well, here we are," said the boy.<p>"I know this place," said Chibi-Usa as she kicked at one of the stones that made up the path to the shrine. "This is where..." Her eyes lit up suddenly and she jumped into the air.<p>"What's with you?" said Ranma as he glared at her for a moment.<p>He watched as the girl rushed down the stairway towards the Masaki home.<p>"Hey! Wait up you little brat!" snapped Ranma.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ryoko was having a nice nap. Was being the operative word. "Who the heck?" she snorted as she looked at the small pink haired child attached to her neck.<p>"Ryoko! Big sister!" cried the girl happily.<p>"Who's this Ryoko?" muttered Tenchi as he looked down at the scene. Ryoko had been sleeping on that spot on the porch the last time he had come by.<p>"Hey! Cut that out! Who the heck are you?" snapped Ryoko as she tried to dislodge the child.<p>Chibi-Usa smirked as she felt her older sister grab her arm. She twisted and threw her over her shoulder and into the ground. "Ha!"<p>Ryoko was laid out flat on the ground, face down. She lifted her head up and narrowed her eyes. "I'm gonna kick your butt kid."<p>"Ryoko! She's just a little girl!" snapped Tenchi as he kneeled down next to the girl. "Hello. Who are you? Are you lost?"<p>"Lost? Why would I be lost? I came to visit my big sister!" said Chibi-Usa happily.<p>"Huh?" said the boy as he looked at her. "Are you another of Ayeka's relatives?"<p>"That old bat? No way! I'm Ryoko's little sister!" said the girl as she crossed her arms and frowned at her.<p>"Just for that, I'll forgive you kid," said Ryoko as she stood up and dusted herself off. "That doesn't explain why you think you're my sister. I don't have any sisters."<p>"Yes, you do," said Ranma as he walked up to the group and smirked. "This is Chibi-Usa. She's your half sister."<p>"Huh?" said Ryoko as she looked at him. "You mean...this is your kid?"<p>"Don't look so surprised. I told you about this," said Ranma as he glanced at her.<p>"Washuu is kind of in her lab right now," said Tenchi.<p>"That's okay. I didn't come to see her," said Ranma as he shrugged his shoulders.<p>"Yeah! We're here to help!" said Chibi-Usa as she raised her arm into the air.<p>"Help?" said Tenchi and Ryoko in unison.<p>"That's right Ryoko. Transform now," said Ranma as he turned and smiled at her. It wasn't a nice smile.<p>"What do you mean transform?" she said as she snorted at him.<p>Ranma's aura came to life around him as he transformed and glared at her for a moment. "If you don't transform, this is going to hurt a lot more."<p>Ryoko backed away from him. "Wait a minute! What do you think you're doing?"<p>Chibi-Usa transformed as well, a much more cheerful looking grin on her face.<p>"Wait! What's going on here?" stammered Tenchi.<p>"You should leave now," said Ranma as he looked at the boy.<p>"You're not going to hurt her are you?" gasped the boy as he looked at the pair for a moment. "I won't let you!"<p>"Ha! These two can't hurt me!" snapped Ryoko.<p>"She will not be...permanently damaged," said Ranma as he looked at Tenchi.<p>"Now wait a minute!" cried Tenchi.<p>Ryoko jumped into the air and flew back as the pair jumped towards her. "Whoa! What do you think you're..."<p>Ranma caught her across her jaw and frowned a little more. "Transform. It doesn't hurt as much if you do."<p>Tenchi moved out into the yard, Tenchi-ken was in his grip. "Stop it right now! You're hurting her!" he cried.<p>"Boy!" said Yosho as he appeared behind his grandson. "Let it go."<p>"But...they're killing her!" cried Tenchi as he looked up and saw the pair beating Ryoko relentlessly.<p>"Ryoko will be fine," said the old man calmly. "She no longer has her gems, and she must learn to defend herself again."<p>"But..." said the boy.<p>"Tenchi, when she fought against Kagato the second time. She was more powerful than he was," said the old man calmly.<p>"What?" stammered the boy as he tried to tear his eyes away from the beating.<p>"Do you know why she lost?" said the old man as he looked on as well.<p>"No," said Tenchi carefully.<p>"It is because despite all her power, she is still unable to control it. So long she has fought with those gems of hers, that her defense was broken completely."<p>"But this is..." stammered Tenchi.<p>"He is her father, I will not dispute his training methods, even if I do not agree with them completely. This is only the first lesson, I do not imagine that it will be this bad the next time," said Yosho.<p>"You knew about this?" gasped Tenchi.<p>Yosho nodded. "He called ahead, and asked that I not interfere, or allow any of you to get in the way," said the old man with a small nod.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ryoko fell to the ground in a heap. She slowly pushed herself up with her arms and glared at the pair who floated over her.<p>"Transform," said Ranma.<p>"What's the matter sis?" asked Chibi-Usa with a slightly worried frown.<p>Ryoko lowered her head and grunted in pain and frustration as she rose to her feet. "I don't know how."<p>"Well, you'll learn then," said Ranma as he landed and detransformed. "You're going to need it someday."<p>Ryoko glared at him and lunged foreword. He sidestepped the clumsy attack and kneed her in her stomach. "If you want to beat me, you won't do it without transforming. You've got power, the fact that you can still fly tells me that much."<p>The woman fell to her knees, clutching her stomach. "Bastard."<p>"You think you hate me?" he said coldly.<p>"I'll get you for this," she spat.<p>"Hmm. I think you'll appreciate what I'm doing the next time you're in a real fight," he said calmly.<p>"What would you know?" she spat.<p>"Washuu could have supplied you with more gems," said Ranma with a smirk on his face. "I asked her not to, and she agreed."<p>"What? That witch! I'll..."<p>"You'll learn how to unlock your real power, if you still want them after that. I'm sure she'll agree," said Ranma calmly.<p>"Why are you doing this," said Ryoko as she staggered back to her feet.<p>"You're my daughter, I'm not going to take anything but the best from you. I wasn't there to raise you, mostly because I had to return here, to my own time."<p>"Yeah, thanks loads, Pop," she spat.<p>"I didn't even know about you until I saw you transform when we were fighting Kagato. Washuu never said anything."<p>Ryoko looked at him for a moment. "What difference does that make?"<p>"I'm here now," he said with a shrug. "I'm not about to have a weak daughter."<p>"I'll show you weak!" snapped the woman angrily.<p>"Spore," said Ranma as he turned towards his younger daughter.<p>"Don't call me that!" snapped Chibi-Usa as she glared at him. "You ape!"<p>"Shut up and show her how weak she is," said Ranma with a snort.<p>"What?" muttered Ryoko.<p>"Don't do anything. I want you to relax, and feel what she does. Reach out with your feelings, your energy."<p>Ryoko stepped back and watched them for a moment.<p>The little girl exploded with power, her aura forming around her as her energy increased again.<p>"What is this? I feel something!" muttered Ryoko in shock.<p>"That's her power level you're feeling. With practice, you'll be able to identify people with it. It's distinctive with everyone. I'm still learning about that myself."<p>"What's the big deal? Her hair has changed," snorted Ryoko. She was slowly regaining her strength, but didn't feel ready to attack again.<p>"No?" asked Ranma with another smirk. "Power down, Spore."<p>Chibi-Usa growled, but complied. Her hair changed to pink again and she looked at Ryoko.<p>The woman gasped. She felt the power fade significantly. "What is this?"<p>"So, you do feel it," said Ranma with an amused looking grin. "Well, that's something I suppose."<p>"I..." Ryoko didn't know what that was, but she wanted it.<p>"When you fought Kagato, your emotions released your hidden potential. Now we have to draw it out," said Ranma as he smirked at her. "I'm going to train you, and bring it foreword."<p>Ryoko growled at this, but didn't say a word. She hung her head and turned away.<p>"I thought as much," said Ranma with a snort.<p>"What do you mean?" she snapped angrily.<p>"You want it don't you?" he said with a chuckle.<p>"I don't want anything from you!" she retorted.<p>"Don't lie. I can see it in your eyes. If you're still unsure, we could go ask Washuu. She's connected to you, and she won't lie."<p>Ryoko blushed and turned her back to them. "Do what you want. It's not like I could stop you."<p>"He's right you know," said Washuu as she walked up to them. Her holographic computer was in front of her and she appeared to be looking towards the sky.<p>"What are you doing out here?" asked Ranma.<p>"I've been reading something unusual," said Washuu. "It's been moving towards Earth ever since we got back."<p>"Oh?" asked Ranma.<p>"It's very small," she replied as she continued to type. "I haven't been able to get a decent reading though."<p>"That's odd," commented Ranma.<p>"Very," agreed Washuu. "We should find out what it is shortly."<p>Ranma blinked and looked up. His eyes went wide and he gasped. "What the heck is that? I can feel it!"<p>"Feel?" asked Washuu.<p>Chibi-Usa was looking up at the sky with a frown on her face. "So. It's time is it?"<p>"Time for what?" said Ranma as he looked at her and frowned.<p>"You'll see," she replied calmly.<p>"In any case, I think that's enough for today," said Ranma as he frowned at them. "I'll come back tomorrow, I've got another student and I'll try to bring her by with me next time."<p>Almost in answer to that, Hotaru floated out of the sky and landed next to them. She glanced around and frowned. After a moment she turned towards Ranma and spoke. "Something is coming."<p>"What are you doing here, Saturn?" said the boy as he glanced at her.<p>"I feel something, I thought it would be best to tell you about it," she replied.<p>"Great," grumbled Ranma.<p>"It's going to land..." Washuu looked at her screen and pointed off into the distance. "Somewhere that way. About twenty kilometers away."<p>Ranma frowned and nodded. "We'd better go see what it is."<p>Ryoko looked around in confusion. "What's going on?"<p>"You stay here, we'll handle this," said Ranma as he glanced at her. He, Chibi-Usa, and Hotaru rose into the air.<p>"The hell!" snapped Ryoko as she rose into the air after the trio.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>The citizens of Tokyo moved about their day obliviously. Someone screamed and pointed into the sky. A round spaceship floated over the city, moving towards the ground in the middle of a park. The masses fled in terror as the thing came down.<p>The ramp of the ship came down, and three figures slowly walked down it calmly. Two of them towered over the citizens, while the third appeared to be slightly smaller than an average human. They were still hidden by the steam cloud that the exhaust ports on the sides were emitting.<p>"So...this is Earth is it?" said the small one with a chuckle.<p>"It should fetch a good price," said one of the larger ones.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"We've located the landing point," said Jadeite as he looked up from his place at the console inside the MIB headquarters.<p>Akane walked up and frowned. "What is it?"<p>"The ship's makeup is unknown. We don't have anything on record like it," said Nephrite.<p>"Can we get a visual?" asked Kunzite as he moved up beside Akane.<p>"No, something is jamming us," snorted Jadeite in irritation.<p>"Well, we should go say hello. Where is Ranma?" said Akane with her frown deepening.<p>"There'll be no covering this one up," snorted Nephrite from across the room. He was working on one of the consoles. "The damn thing landed in the middle of Tokyo Park."<p>"Great," snorted Akane. "We locate Ranma?"<p>"It seems he's already on his way," said Jadeite as he looked up at her. "He says 'stay out of the way'."<p>"What? Who does he think he is?" snapped Akane.<p>"He didn't say don't go, just to stay out of his way. I for one don't feel like arguing with him," said Jadeite. "He usually knows what he's talking about in a situation like this."<p>+++++++++++<p>Urd stared at the screen in shock. Skuld and Belldandy stood behind her with worried looks on their faces. "No! It's too late!"<p>"What's going on?" muttered Skuld. "What is that?"<p>"It's a program created by father. When a race becomes hostile, or threatens life in the universe, this kicks in to destroy it. A life form like that has shown up here," said Urd as she sighed and hung her head.<p>"What can we do?" asked Belldandy with a worried frown.<p>"Nothing, there's nothing we can do. We can't stop it," said Urd. "We aren't allowed to do anything. It's a safety program."<p>"That doesn't sound so bad," said Skuld hopefully.<p>"No it doesn't, but the program... it won't stop until its killed every living thing on this planet," said Urd sadly.<p>"Oh! Oh no!" gasped Belldandy. "What about Keiichi!"<p>"There's nothing we can do," said Urd.<p>"Why?" gasped Skuld. "Why would father create something like that?"<p>"It's a safety protocol. It's designed to protect the rest of the Universe," said Urd. "Normally it sits dormant on a planet somewhere. I'm not sure about the exact location. Occasionally, it will be summoned to destroy a planet that's particularly dangerous."<p>"That's horrible!" gasped Belldandy.<p>"But why is it here?" growled Urd. "There's no way it should be on Midigard! Is something wrong with it?"<p>"We have to find out! Maybe we can stop it!" cried Belldandy.<p>"It's here, it's already too late. Once it arrives, it destroys everything. Even if whatever it's after is destroyed or leaves," said Urd as she glanced at them with a deep sadness in her eyes.<p>"No!" gasped Belldandy.<p>"There's got to be a way!" cried Skuld.<p>"I only wish there was," said Urd. "Loki said he knew what brought it here, but it won't do us any good to find out."<p>"Loki!" gasped Belldandy.<p>"Yeah. I ran into him today, he's still stuck inside that mask," said Urd absently.<p>"If anyone knows a way to stop a protocol program, it would be him," said Skuld.<p>"You know he won't help us," said Urd with a frown on her face.<p>"We've just got to try!" cried Belldandy.<p>Urd sighed and nodded. "What's the harm in trying? I'll see if I can locate him."<p>+++++++++++++++<p>The trio of aliens stood in the middle of Tokyo looking around.<p>The tall one frowned as he glanced at the fleeing human population. "Humans, how incredibly typical. It's almost a shame they have such a nice planet. Don't you think so Frieza?"<p>The smaller one smirked, he was now sitting inside a floating transport of some kind, his thick tail hanging out the side. "I suppose we'll just have to take it off of their hands then."<p>"You don't need me for such a pitiful planet," snorted the other one. He was only slightly smaller than the eldest one. "Father, do I have to be here?"<p>"Now Kooler, you know we agreed to do this together. It's so rare that we do things as a family these days," said the largest one with an amused smirk on his face.<p>"Shall we get started then? I'd like to get this over with," snorted Kooler in disgust. "Humans are so weak. It shouldn't take us more than an hour or two to clear off the whole planet."<p>"We need to keep it mostly intact," said Frieza calmly. "Let's make a day of it."<p>"That's the spirit," said King Cold as he smiled at his youngest son.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>
