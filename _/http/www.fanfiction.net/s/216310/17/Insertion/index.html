</div>Insertion<p>Part 17<p>Mousse's new bag?<p>+++++++++++++<p>It was evening out over the Pacific Ocean. Mousse stared out<br/>across the sea as he stood on the bow of the ship that carried him<br/>back to his beloved Shampoo. "I have got to America to perfect my<br/>techniques in hidden weapons. Soon, I shall free you my love!" he said<br/>with tears of determination in his eyes. "Just you wait Ranma Saotome,<br/>I'll have my revenge for all that humiliation soon enough."<p>His thoughts wandered back to the man who had taught him his new<br/>skills. "You must have style as well as flare, it is almost as<br/>important as winning. Understand this young grasshopper, and you shall<br/>overcome all. The stars shine brightly for you my son, go out and make<br/>them believe!"<p>He smirked at the speech and brushed his hair out of his face as<br/>he watched the sunrise. Large gems sparkled from the rings that now<br/>adorned his fingers.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Meanwhile, back in Japan...<p>"Ready?" said Jadeite as he and the other generals stepped back<br/>into combat stances.<p>"Just a moment," said a new voice.<p>Ranma arched his eyebrow as Setsuna stepped out of a porthole and<br/>glared at the two groups for a moment.<p>"Hi honey," he said cheerfully.<p>"You! But...you died!" exclaimed Minako in shock.<p>"Not quite," said Tsuki with a smirk on her face. The rest of the<br/>senshi turned to look at her for a moment and then back to Pluto<br/>again.<p>Setsuna frowned at Ranma and turned to face the senshi for a<br/>moment. "You are not ready."<p>"What?" said Usagi dumbly.<p>"Mistress Pluto!" gasped Tsuki.<p>Ranma noticed her back was turned and walked up behind her, he<br/>reached out and found his hand blocked by an invisible field of<br/>energy. The kick me sign he had intended to place on her back stuck in<br/>mid air for a moment before a surge of power incinerated it.<p>Setsuna ignored him and continued to address the Senshi. "If you<br/>were to fight them now, you would be destroyed."<p>"Aw, come on. Can't they have just a little bit of peril?" said<br/>Ranma with a mock frown on his face.<p>"No," growled Setsuna angrily as she turned her head slightly.<p>"They can take us! I'm sure of it," insisted Ranma.<p>"No they can't," said Setsuna coldly.<p>"But, we weren't even gonna kill em. Just rough em up a bit, you<br/>know..."<p>Setsuna rolled her eyes and turned back towards the senshi again.<br/>"You will withdraw for the moment."<p>"But..." started Usagi, her eyes suddenly went wide as she noticed<br/>Ranma holding up a sign with the words 'Frigid Bitch' written on it<br/>just behind her.<p>Minako choked and almost fell forward.<p>Setsuna turned to glare at him, and he quickly put it behind his<br/>back. All four of the generals were stifling giggles.<p>"As I said, you are not ready. No arguments," insisted Pluto.<p>Ranma's new sign had the words: 'She blows goats. I have proof!'<p>"Um..." said Ami as she pointed at him.<p>"You must trust me, it's far too soon," said Pluto as she didn't<br/>quite understand what the girl was indicating.<p>"But he's..."<p>'Pluto has a dog shaped birthmark just inside her right thigh!'<br/>was the new sign.<p>"Hey! How does he know about..." muttered Tsuki in shocked horror.<br/>She quickly fell silent as she noticed the rest of the group looking<br/>at her.<p>"What are you all looking at? Go home," said Pluto firmly.<p>'Jello fetish! Jello fetish! I've got pictures!'<p>"But you should really..." said Ami with a heavy blush forming on<br/>her cheeks.<p>"I won't say it again, this barrier won't hold them off for long,"<br/>said Pluto calmly.<p>The generals were trying their best not to laugh; all of them<br/>suddenly fell silent as Setsuna turned towards them again. Ranma was<br/>whistling with the sign hidden behind his back.<p>"As for you. Give me those signs," said Pluto with a scowl on her<br/>face.<p>Ranma blinked and swallowed. "Um...heh..." He handed them too her<br/>and she raised the time staff into the air.<p>"Dead Scream."<p>All four generals were blasted back by the force of the attack;<br/>Ranma took it directly and was thrown about thirty yards into the<br/>street. A forcefield of some kind erected around his body and he was<br/>protected from the brunt of the blast. "Ouch."<p>"You won't be laughing for very long. Go tell your mistress that I<br/>won't allow her to succeed," snapped Pluto sharply.<p>"Huh?" muttered Ranma in confusion. "What mistress?"<p>"You think I don't know you're working for Beryl and Metallia?"<br/>said the woman as she narrowed her eyes at the group.<p>"Naw, they quit that job. They work for me now!" said Ranma<br/>cheerfully as he waved the comment off.<p>"The passage of thousands of years, and infinite darkness in your<br/>soul, and you still act like a child Genaku. You disgust me," said<br/>Pluto coldly.<p>"Can't we just kick Endimyon's child molesting ass? Come on, give<br/>us something!" said Ranma as he dusted off his jacket sleeves and<br/>pouted at her.<p>"Hey! I heard that!" said Tuxedo Mask as he whirled around and<br/>growled at the group.<p>"What are you gonna do about it you weenie?" said Ranma as he<br/>stuck his tongue out at the man.<p>Mamoru growled and started to step forward.<p>"Hmmm, lets see. Credits to yen conversion...five hundred...plus<br/>interest...you owe me...Sixty Billion Yen," said Zocite as he worked<br/>on his calculator and glanced up at the man for a moment.<p>"What? That's outrageous!" snapped Tuxedo Mask.<p>"Well, you have accrued thousands of years worth of interest after<br/>all," replied the general with a small shrug. "If you can't pay it,<br/>I'm sure we can find another way for you to work it off." He gave the<br/>man a dark smile and crossed his arms over his chest.<p>Usagi appeared at his side and pulled at his arm. "Come on! Just<br/>forget about them for now!"<p>"That can be arranged," commented Ranma with a rough sounding<br/>snort.<p>"You stay away from them," snapped Pluto angrily.<p>"Or you'll what?" said Ranma coldly.<p>"I am the Senshi of Time! I could erase your very existence!" she<br/>said angrily.<p>"They why haven't you?" said Ranma with a smirk forming on his<br/>face.<p>The woman growled at him and clenched her fists.<p>"Come now Setsuna, you know better than to try and bluff me," said<br/>the boy casually. "You're as helpless against me as they are. I've got<br/>other things to worry about. Besides, I know who they are and where<br/>they live. I could have eliminated them anytime I felt like it."<p>"Then why haven't you?" countered Pluto coldly.<p>"Where would be the fun in that?" said Ranma with a small chuckle.<p>She turned away from him and entered the porthole. "Tsuki. We are<br/>leaving!"<p>"R-right!" said the girl as she jumped from her hiding place<br/>behind a nearby car and followed her mistress.<p>A moment later, the barrier fell.<p>"To the bar!" announced Ranma cheerfully as he started to walk<br/>away.<p>The four generals looked at one another and shrugged their<br/>shoulders.<p>"You know, being reborn hasn't changed him much," commented<br/>Jadeite.<p>+++++++++++<p>The next morning, before the sun had risen over the horizon, Ranma<br/>sat up and scratched his head as something hit him in the face. He<br/>mumbled to himself as he lifted the offending object into his hands<br/>and flipped it over a few times. It was an envelope.<p>"Huh? Wazzis?" He opened it and squinted as he read the note<br/>inside out loud. "Ranma Saotome, I Mousse, formally challenge you to a<br/>duel tomorrow evening. Be at the gates of Furinkan High at eight o'<br/>clock in the evening."<p>Ranma muttered to himself for a moment and lay his head back down<br/>as he went back to sleep.<p>+++++++++++<p>"You don't suppose Tsuki is..." said Rei with a blush forming on<br/>her face. She and the other inner senshi were all sitting around a<br/>table in a fast food restaurant.<p>"She could be...I mean... she knew about that birthmark," said<br/>Minako with a cheerful smile. "But then...how did that guy know about<br/>it?"<p>"Past life?" ventured Makoto.<p>"Could be, maybe Pluto and Tsuki were...you know...changed by the<br/>rebirth?" said Ami nervously.<p>"Could be," said Rei calmly. "I'm more interested in how he knows<br/>about it. That could be dangerous! How do we know we can trust Pluto?"<p>"Tsuki, she always was a little, you know...odd..." muttered Ami<br/>nervously.<p>"Well, if she is..." muttered Usagi with an uncomfortable frown.<p>"Hi guys!" said Tsuki as she appeared with a tray of food in her<br/>grasp. She sat down and the girls moved away from her a little.<br/>"What?" she said in confusion.<p>"Um...nothing," muttered Makoto.<p>"Hey, you want some of my fries Usagi. I'm not going to eat them<br/>all," said the girl with a cheerful smile as she turned towards the<br/>blond.<p>"Um, no thanks," said the girl as she moved a little further away.<p>Rei leaned her head forward a bit and watched the girl in silence.<br/>"Mistress Pluto?" she wondered silently. "Could it really be that..."<p>"Are you feeling all right Usagi?" said Tsuki as she put her hand<br/>on the girl's forehead. "I've never known you to turn down free food."<br/>She blinked and noticed Rei had turned an interesting shade of red.<br/>"What's with her?"<p>Minako elbowed Rei in her ribs and laughed. "It's nothing really."<p>"Okay," said the girl obliviously as she started to eat. "So, what<br/>are you planning to do about those evil guys?"<p>Luna popped her head out of Usagi's bag. "I think it would be wise<br/>to follow Pluto's advice for the time being. That one boy has beaten<br/>us three times already. There isn't much we can do against all five of<br/>them at once."<p>"Still, it seems a bit odd for us to just sit around and do<br/>nothing," muttered Usagi. "What did this guy do anyway?"<p>"He was a terrible man," said Artemis as he popped his head out as<br/>well. "Probably one of the most evil beings in the universe. He turned<br/>the oceans of Venus into gelatin once. He was also the only thing in<br/>the galaxy that wasn't afraid of the Senshi of Saturn's power."<p>"Gelatin?" said Makoto in confusion.<p>"Yes," agreed Luna. "This was before he turned to Beryl's side. He<br/>destroyed Pluto's moon, and destroyed many great monuments. Most of<br/>them as some sort of practical joke."<p>"What do you mean?" said Usagi nervously.<p>"Well, there used to be a statue of Venus in the courtyard of the<br/>royal palace on her planet. One day, he decided it would be funny to<br/>carve away the clothing so that the statue was nude," said Luna.<p>Venus blushed and stared at the cat in disbelief. "He...what?"<p>"Don't forget the time he blew up most of Mercury during the<br/>Sailor Sol experiment," added Artemis.<p>"How awful," said Tsuki as she scrunched her face up in disgust.<p>"Um, yeah," muttered Usagi uncomfortably.<p>"Oh stop that!" snapped Luna. "Some of you used to swing that way<br/>back then you know."<p>Usagi, Makoto, and Ami all turned pale at this announcement.<br/>"What?"<p>"Really? Who?" said Minako as she leaned forward and smirked.<p>Rei simply sat silently and pretended not to be interested.<p>"We don't remember," said Artemis with a small shrug.<p>"Imagine that," commented Minako flatly.<p>"What are you guys talking about?" muttered Tsuki in confusion.<p>"Oh, don't worry about it. It's nothing," said Usagi cheerfully.<p>"Kay," said the girl as she shrugged the comment off and went back<br/>to her food.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma stood just outside the gates of Furinkan High with a scowl<br/>on his face. In his hand was a letter of challenge that he had<br/>received yesterday evening. It was evening, but a small crowd of<br/>students had come to watch the fight. The boy chucked to himself when<br/>he saw the look on Nabiki's face after he had told her that he had<br/>already sold the information about the fight. She was there, running<br/>the betting pools, so it wasn't a complete loss to her.<p>"Where is the jerk though?" he muttered to himself as he looked<br/>down at the note.<p>"So, you decided to appear?" said a familiar voice from nowhere.<p>"Mousse, you dip. Where the hell are you?"<p>The challenger ignored him and continued to speak. "Heh, I almost<br/>went home to China to train you know. I realized that martial arts<br/>wouldn't be enough to beat you though."<p>"Quit foolin around. I got school tomorrow," snorted Ranma<br/>irritably as he glanced around for the boy.<p>"You won't be in any condition to attend school after I'm through<br/>with you," said Mousse's voice from the shadows. "You see, I went to<br/>the magic capitol of the world and improved my skills a hundred fold.<br/>Now, you'll never defeat me."<p>"Great. Heard it all before, now come on out so I can kick your<br/>butt. I'm tired," snarled Ranma.<p>As if in answer to that, two sparkling pyrotechnics appeared on<br/>either side of the gates of Furinkan. Ranma blinked and turned to see<br/>that someone was standing with his back to him and his arms spread<br/>wide. Music began too play in the background from somewhere and the<br/>strange figure was suddenly bathed in light from a spotlight.<p>Ranma almost choked at what he saw.<p>Mousse looked completely different. A pair of outdated sunglasses<br/>rested on the bridge of his nose, and his hair was now sticking<br/>straight out in front of his head in a long set of bangs that<br/>protruded four feet from his forehead. He was wearing a white jumpsuit<br/>with a small cape, the entire outfit was covered in rhinestones. He<br/>spun around to face Ranma and curled his lip. "Yer goin down,<br/>Saotome."<p>"Good lord!" said Ranma in shock. "What the hell happened too<br/>you?"<p>"The king lives on!" cried Mousse as he pointed his finger into<br/>the air.<p>"It's Moussvis?" stammered the shocked martial artist as he<br/>staggered back from the scene.<p>The small group of spectators who had gathered had yet to react.<p>"Prepare to die!" said the Chinese boy as he swaggered forward.<br/>Every once and a while, he'd stop in an unusual pose before moving<br/>towards his opponent again.<p>"Look you weenie," started Ranma as he cracked his knuckles.<p>Mousse rushed forward suddenly, slamming a kick into Ranma's gut.<br/>"Hoo! Ha!"<p>The ponytailed boy bent forward in surprise. "What the?"<p>"Come on!" said Mousse angrily.<p>"The capitol of magic?" muttered one of the students dumbly.<p>"Las Vegas," confirmed Nabiki with a small nod. "At least it was<br/>interesting, even if it would be a rather short fight."<p>"That does it!" cried Ranma angrily as his aura began to burn<br/>around him. "The 'King' dies again tonight!"<p>Mousse never stood a chance, amidst the cries of pain an<br/>occasional "Hey! Watch the hair man!" would be uttered.<p>Finally, it stopped. Mousse was laid out across the pavement.<br/>Ranma snorted and turned away from him.<p>"You may have won the battle, but my baby will come too me. I've<br/>got more style than I know what to do with!" said Mousse from the<br/>ground. "No woman can resist The King. Not even my darlin Shampoo!"<p>"Good luck then," said Ranma as he waved his hand without looking<br/>back. The martial artist was already on his way home.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Well, that was pointless," commented Ranma bitterly. "Aren't you<br/>two done yet?"<p>Carrot and Dan were still laughing. Ranma was starting to grow<br/>irritated because it was causing his eyes to water.<p>"Whatever," grumbled Ranma as he continued to walk towards the<br/>dojo.<p>"I thought it was a very nice outfit," commented Pissant. "You two<br/>should really be more polite."<p>Their trek home was interrupted by a familiar voice.<p>"Ranma."<p>++++++++++<p>All of them stopped dead in their tracks and turned to face<br/>Nabiki.<p>"Huh?" said the boy dumbly as he turned to face her. "What's up?"<p>"I'm getting tired of you getting in my way," she said coldly as<br/>she stepped out in front of him with her arms crossed over her chest.<p>"Huh?" said the boy in obviously feigned ignorance. "What do you<br/>mean?"<p>"It was cute at first, but it's starting to cut into my profits. I<br/>can't accept that," she said firmly. She had a yellow envelope in her<br/>grasp and handed it to him.<p>He took it from her and smiled as he looked at the contents. It<br/>was photos of the two of them making out. "Hey! I remember this!" he<br/>said cheerfully.<p>"I'm willing to make them disappear, if you'll stop bothering my<br/>business," said the girl with a smirk forming on her face.<p>"Huh? What are you talkin about? Can I get some copies of these?"<br/>said the boy cheerfully.<p>"If my father finds out about these..." she said in a warning<br/>tone.<p>"He'll be ecstatic. You don't think he really cares which one of<br/>you I marry do you?"<p>Nabiki blinked and looked at him for a moment. "You cheated on my<br/>sister! He'll..."<p>"Simply switch the engagement. After all, our destined love must<br/>have been much more exciting since we had to hide it away. Besides,<br/>Akane and I have an agreement about the whole marriage thing. Neither<br/>one of us is actually taking this engagement seriously."<p>Nabiki was almost in shock. This had worked in her favor every<br/>time she had tried it before. Even the toughest of boys caved in to<br/>her demands once she presented evidence like this to them. Many<br/>fearing what their parents would say, while others fearing their<br/>girlfriends.<p>"Come on, don't look so surprised. I'm actually a little<br/>disappointed that you didn't think this through a little better. It<br/>isn't like you at all," said Ranma as he shoved the photos back into<br/>her chest.<p>Nabiki growled and looked down at the ground in disgust. He was<br/>right, she let her temper get the better of her. That had caused a<br/>laps in judgement, she screwed up, and he came out on top yet again.<br/>She glared at his back for a moment and her frown deepened. "Wait a<br/>minute." She rushed up and grabbed him by his shoulder.<p>"What? Did you have something else?"<p>It was also a real turn on.<p>Ranma froze as the girl grabbed his head roughly and kissed him.<br/>She broke the kiss and stepped back for a moment.<p>"Hey! Wait a minute, look Nabiki..." started the boy nervously.<p>"Oh shut up. I don't want to go out with you," she snorted. "I'm<br/>sure as hell never going to marry you. So what is the problem?"<p>The boy blinked and looked at her for a moment. "Problem? What<br/>problem?"<p>"Good," she replied as she shoved him in his chest and into some<br/>bushes. He fell back and vanished from sight. "Men," she muttered as<br/>she rolled her eyes and went after him.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Wow," said Dan as they sat on the porch the next day.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"I feel so violated!" cried Pissant.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"Who coulda known?" muttered Carrot. "I told you we should have<br/>picked her."<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"I agree with you," said Dan as he rubbed at their back for a<br/>moment. It was still sore.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"She definitely wasn't an amateur, that's saying a lot for someone<br/>her age," commented Carrot.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"We need to talk to someone, we've been raped!" whined Pissant.<p>"Raped? I was enjoying myself," commented Dan.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"Me too," agreed Carrot. "I don't see a problem."<p>"But, we took away her purity! Now we have to..."<p>"Nabiki Tendo was anything but pure," snorted Dan casually.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"Hey, by the way Ranma. Now we might have gotten Nabiki pregnant,<br/>just for future reference," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Hey, it's mom," said Ranma as he looked up and saw his mother<br/>standing in the doorway.<p>"Hello," she said with a small bow of greeting.<p>"Auntie Saotome!" said Akane happily.<p>"It's good to see you dear," said the woman cheerfully. "Is my<br/>husband here?"<p>"Naw, he's still too scared to show his butt around here when you<br/>come over," said Ranma cheerfully. "I think it had something to do<br/>with the 'fur coat' incident."<p>"Oh dear. It seems he's escaped me again," said the woman sweetly<br/>as she sat down next to Ranma. "I look so good in black and white<br/>too."<p>"You'll catch him," said Ranma with an encouraging smile.<p>"I hope so," she agreed cheerfully.<p>The Tendos all looked pretty uncomfortable with the conversation.<br/>It was far from abnormal when the pair had gotten together in recent<br/>times.<p>The family had gotten along well at one point. Ranko made her<br/>appointed visits when the woman showed up, and Genma got more and more<br/>frustrated. Finally, he announced that they were going to take a trip<br/>to Jusenkyo, and destroy the curse once and for all.<p>Naturally, Nodoka had taken offence to this. She'd grown rather<br/>fond of her 'daughter' and forbade it. After all, in her mind, it was<br/>the same thing as murder.<p>Genma loudly voiced his own ignorant opinion of women in general,<br/>and the effect the demon girl was having on their son. The cherry on<br/>top of it had been his announcement that the girl had to be destroyed,<br/>for the sake of the family of course.<p>Things went downhill from there. Ranma couldn't have been happier.<p>That bothered the Tendos more than anything else did; Ranma didn't<br/>even look slightly uncomfortable as his mother pulled out a cookbook<br/>from China. It was an older book, and detailed several ways to prepare<br/>panda for human consumption.<p>Fortunately for them, Nodoka returned home soon enough and left<br/>Ranma with them once again.<p>"Boy! What do you think you're doing?" snapped Genma. "You've got<br/>to tell your mother the truth at once!"<p>"Why? So we can both be under the knife instead of just you?" said<br/>the boy calmly as he sipped at his tea.<p>"Don't be stupid boy, we'll..."<p>"This is your mess old man. I'm perfectly safe as things are now,<br/>you would be too if you had kept your mouth shut. If I say anything<br/>now, especially after playing 'Ranko' for so long, she'd kill the both<br/>of us."<p>"That's not the point!" snapped Genma.<p>"Really? I didn't think you had one," said Ranma lazily. "Pretty<br/>darn selfish of you to try and drag me along with you to the grave I'd<br/>say."<p>"Really Saotome, he's right," commented Soun. "How can the schools<br/>be united if you're both dead?"<p>"Tendo?" muttered Genma in shock.<p>"I'm sorry to be so harsh, Saotome. He is correct though, it is<br/>better if only you die, and thus our schools will be united and<br/>continue on. Besides, I'm sure you can work this out with your wife.<br/>It'll just take a little time."<p>"I dunno, she seems really attached to that barbecue recipe Mr.<br/>Tendo," commented Ranma.<p>Genma began to cry, and Soun tried his best to comfort his friend.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Beryl stood before the dark cloud and bowed deeply.<p>"So, the generals have escaped us have they?"<p>Beryl growled, her anger flashing in her eyes, she dared not look<br/>up at Metallia though.<p>"We'll just have to destroy them," said the dark cloud coldly.<p>"As you wish, but it is difficult to gather energy with only<br/>myself. Your awakening will take more time I'm afraid."<p>"No," said Metallia coldly. "I have another way."<p>Beryl finally dared to look up. "What?"<p>Four dark shadows seemed to melt from the evil energy surrounding<br/>her. They remained still and hidden in the darkness.<p>"Who?"<p>"Youma Lords," said Metallia. "More powerful than those foolish<br/>men who betrayed you."<p>"I thank you," said Beryl as she bowed even deeper to the thing.<p>"Do not fail me again, or I shall replace you next time."<p>"I... understand," said Beryl.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: School, yet again!<p>
