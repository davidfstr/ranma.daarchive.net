</div>Insertion<p>Episode 92<p>The voyage home.<p>The forces of light and darkness are in the final stages of preparation for the final battle.<p>The evil Ranma awaits the awakening of Saffron with his daughter in Jusendo while the Phoenix people cower in the jungle below the mountain. His dark plans coming closer to completion as the Armada draws near.<p>Trunks and Gohan lead the Men in Black out of Joketzuko. Keiichi has remained behind leaving the village under the protection of the Goddesses, and the Amazon women. The remains of the group move on, hoping to hide in the southwestern portion of the continent for a time.<p>The true 'Ranma', who is currently using the name Trunks, has finished the Senshi's training and is preparing to leave Jurai and return to Earth. The Emperor, who is indebted to the boy and his friends for saving Jurai, has allowed three Juraian battle cruisers to accompany them. These ships will be under the command of Prince Tenchi, who's victory over Cerio resulted in a formal engagement with the Princess Ayeka. During this time, in a desperate attempt to ensure the boy's happiness would continue to suffer, Yosho and Trunks both came to an agreement between their families, engaging Ryoko to the unfortunate boy.<p>The pair had a most excellent time when they sat the boy down alone with them and explained it all, in painful detail, with serious frowns on their faces. Neither one bothered to inform him that he could have more than one wife. The best part was doing it together and watching the boy's head whip back and forth as he stared at them both in helpless horror as they explained the heavy burden of honor the agreements both had attached to them.<p>After all, when this mess was over they didn't want things to get boring did they?...<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks smirked as he slipped on his shades and adjusted his tie. The old uniform kind of felt good. He'd had one tailored for himself during their stay on Jurai. "I guess we should be leaving soon then?"<p>Tenchi was sitting on a small pillow on the floor with his head hanging low. He had a horrified expression on his face. His grandfather was sitting sternly on his other side.<p>"But, I can't...if I marry one of them...then..." The poor boy was at an absolute loss. "Wait!" He looked up at the two men with a frightened expression. "How am I supposed to do this?"<p>"I dunno," replied Trunks with a small shrug as Yosho quietly dodged the question by standing behind the boy. "Kill one of em maybe?" Unlike Yosho, he could actually claim to not know about Juraian marriage customs later on.<p>The boy just stared at him blankly. The kid smirked at him as he glanced over his shoulder. "How you figure this out is your problem." He turned away from the large mirror on the wall and turned towards the door. "You two should probably start packing. We'll be leaving in a few hours."<p>"So soon?" said Yosho in surprise, it was more to keep the conversation going than anything else. He had to make sure the boy had enough time to forget about asking him anything.<p>"Heh. I think I can handle that asshole no problem." The boy seemed to actually be drawing power from his own arrogance at the moment. The still youthful Juraian seemed a bit put off by that for a moment as he glanced at Tenchi. He was somewhat relieved to see the boy's face was doubtful.<p>"I don't know about no problem. This was an awful lot of training for a single opponent."<p>"Indeed it was," agreed Yosho calmly. "You'd best be ready for the storm ahead. This battle will be unlike any you've fought before my boy. To be in command of a force as powerful as a Juraian battle cruiser is no small task. I have watched your actions in the recent events, and I know you are ready."<p>Tenchi sat in silence for a long moment. "Command?"<p>"Yes," replied his Grandfather as he stood to his feet and held out his hand. "Come boy. We have a lot to discuss and little time."<p>Tenchi nodded with a serious looking frown on his face. The pair walked out of the room and passed by Trunks in the hallway. The boy was leaning out a window with a cigarette in his fingers and watching the natural beauty it seemed.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Man. This is gonna be so cool!" said Carrot cheerfully. "We've got an army of anime heroes at our disposal. He's got two monsters and a few crummy Sailor Moon villains. Hotaru will probably keep Chibi Usa for herself and we won't really have to bother with it at all!"<p>"I'm lookin forward to the space battle myself," said Dan as he puffed the cigarette. "Lots of explosions, high speed, countless enemies buzzing around us."<p>"Well, Piloting is fun," agreed Ranma. "I think I'm gonna go with Carrot on this one. I just want to pound that guy's face in with my bare hands."<p>"How could you be looking forward to this mess?" cried Pissant.<p>"Maybe we'll get laid again in the commotion?" muttered Carrot with a heavy sigh. "It's been quite a while."<p>"Probably be a year or two before we get laid, we still got some serious growing to do before any babes will pay attention to us," said Dan as he shrugged.<p>"Right," whined Carrot.<p>"Hello," said a cheerful voice from beside him.<p>Trunks jumped back in surprised shock as Washuu simply stood there leaning towards him with a huge grin on her face. "What?" he muttered after he got his cool back and put the cigarette between his lips again.<p>"Smoking is bad for you," said the woman cheerfully.<p>"So am I."<p>"Oh. I see."<p>"Did you want something, or are you just bothering me because you're bored?" He smirked at her and she slapped him across his face.<p>"Now what?"<p>"What's wrong with you all of a sudden?" grumbled the woman irritably.<p>"I'm frustrated with my own age," he said simply. "Besides, sometimes I'm just cranky."<p>"Hotaru says it's a bit more often than sometimes, but I've noticed that."<p>"I suppose you would notice a lot of odd things about me," he replied with a small shrug.<p>"Frustrated with your own age?" she asked him in confusion.<p>"I'm used to looking a bit older than this. It's kind of annoying really. I've got to go through a lot of stupid things again."<p>"Oh. I get it. First dates and all that?"<p>"I don't think this body has even finished puberty yet."<p>"Oh my," muttered the woman as she stared at him for a long moment.<p>"I'm not really worried about it. I'm a saiyan, so it'll be relatively short and painless. It's just, I kind of miss certain things ya know?"<p>"Actually, I know exactly what you mean. I'd offer to help, but I doubt you'd be able to perform for a year or two anyway."<p>"Yeah. Thanks loads," he grumbled sourly.<p>"I could accelerate your aging process a bit, sort of a kick in the pants, but it would still take a month or two to kick in. I'd need another week here as well."<p>The boy simply chuckled. "No thanks. Maybe I'll take you up on that later, but for now I'll just wait it out. I want to beat his ass as a little kid."<p>"Men," grumbled the scientist as she rolled her eyes and turned away from him.<p>The boy just grunted at her with a smirk on his face.<p>Washuu simply shrugged and walked away. There were still things she didn't understand in the universe, and that boy was one of them.<p>Trunks simply hung limply over the edge of the window and stared down at the ground far below him. "This sucks. Why do we have to be so damn prideful? We'd have an advantage if we did it. Well, I don't care about our image all right?"<p>"Um, who are you talking to sir?" Minako walked up behind the boy but he didn't bother to move.<p>"I'm talking to myself because I'm in a bad mood."<p>"Oh." She seemed even more confused and stepped back slightly. "Why?"<p>"Because I need to get laid. If you aren't going to help me with that then please go away." The boy had yet to budge and Minako blushed as she stared at him in disbelief. He couldn't have been older than eight by the look of him.<p>"I need our departure time. I'm coordinating our schedule."<p>Carrot finally glanced over his shoulder and noticed she was holding a clipboard. "Jeezus. What the hell did I do to them?" he grumbled as he went back to hanging. "Whenever you finish packing. How's that?"<p>"Make that this evening. The Emperor wishes to invite the senshi, and their friends to another formal gathering this evening."<p>"Blow it out your..." snarled Trunks as he whirled around to growl at the offender. He backed off considerably when he realized it was Azusa himself. "Oh. Hi. We kind of need to leave soon. Our planet is quite possibly demolished already. It'd be nice if we could manage to salvage what's left. Ranma Saotome is more than enough to do it before the starships arrive."<p>The senshi glanced around at each other for a moment. All of them had serious frowns on their faces.<p>Azusa merely nodded. "Yes. I know. This is a very important party. I'd like to introduce you to a few people actually. Those familiar with rebuilding a planet should the need arise. If it is destroyed, I imagine you'd die anyway. Should you be victorious, connections like these could lessen the blow considerably. I have gathered that what you face at home is even more powerful than what you faced here."<p>The boy only nodded once.<p>"I'm also giving you a bit of a leg up. Though you do not yet have control of your planet. I imagine it will be a relatively simple matter for you when it ends, should you win. In any case, the Juraian government recognizes the planet as under the rule of the Senshi. You have the full support of the nation, and it's allies I assure you."<p>"I wouldn't place any bets on that, but it sounds like it just might be worth our time," said Nabiki as she walked up behind the pair. "I was wondering what was taking you so long."<p>"Sorry Ma'am," replied Minako nervously as she handed the clipboard over.<p>"Great. You all owe me again for this one," growled Trunks as he glared at Nabiki and Minako.<p>Nabiki just smirked. "I know."<p>"This had better be everything you say it is, or a reasonable facsimile.<p>I'm already sure you're lying."<p>The man shrugged his shoulders. "The Kingdom ruled by Serenity was powerful and a great ally. We owe a lot to her people."<p>"Yeah. So this is a political thing for us, because we saved your collective asses?"<p>"If you wish to look at it that way. I prefer to think of it as extending our friendly relations to the next ten thousand years."<p>"It doesn't hurt that it's the home planet of the boy who might someday become emperor himself."<p>"What?" snarled Azusa as he flared his nostrils and stood up firmly.<p>"Don't give me that. You knew Tenchi would cream Cerio. Don't play dumb with me old man."<p>"It's polite to ignore it," commented Nabiki.<p>"I'm a real nice guy really, but I'm not polite."<p>"I'd noticed that," growled Azusa as he adjusted his garments and calmed considerably.<p>Trunks grinned at him and wagged his tail. "I'm right aren't I?"<p>The Emperor merely turned away and walked off.<p>"Aw, spoilsport."<p>"You are the only person I know with enough balls to tease an Emperor," said Nabiki as she arched her eyebrow at him and turned away. Minako followed behind her to what was probably a meeting.<p>One of the things that annoyed Carrot the most was organization. He hated people who were too organized. He didn't even really know why, he just did.<p>"This is really starting to piss me off. We need to find some action so they'll stop being so West Point. A little wear and tear does a soldier a lot of good."<p>"He's got a point. They're still green," agreed Dan.<p>"Green? Are you insane?" cried Pissant. "After all we did to them you think they're still green?"<p>"Well, Ami isn't..." agreed Carrot begrudgingly. "After torturing someone to death and carrying out a few executions I'm sure she's pretty much as changed as she's going to be. I don't recall any of the others actually killing anyone yet though.""<p>Dan merely growled as he made them look towards the sunset dramatically. "At the moment they realize that all of it was real, it will all change again. We need something to wake them up before we get there."<p>"Great. How 'bout we ask Washuu?" said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"Yeah," agreed Ranma. "Besides, I'm starting to rethink this whole going back as a kid thing."<p>"Quit being such a wimp," grumbled Carrot.<p>"I think this is a bad idea," muttered Pissant.<p>"Yes, we know. That's why no one asked you," replied Carrot.<p>"Jerk," grumbled the voice pathetically.<p>"Yeah," agreed Dan. "Still, he's got a point."<p>"Thanks... Hey!"<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma smiled as the flaming wings blasted out of the sides of the mountain. Chibi Usa looked surprised as their foothold crumbled beneath them. Her father simply floated where he had always been and stared at the creature that climbed out of the mountain. It was mostly human in appearance, save for the clawed appendages and gigantic wings.<p>"He's more powerful than predicted," grumbled Chibi Usa.<p>"Yes I know," replied her father calmly. He uncrossed his arms and floated forward.<p>Saffron was glaring at him angrily as he hovered just outside the wall of flame that made up the giant bird that was still surrounding him.<p>"Hello, Saffron."<p>"You'll suffer for what you did," growled the god angrily.<p>"I think not. I doubt I'll even need to transform to beat you."<p>"You're a fool then," chuckled the phoenix.<p>"Quit playing with him. Just transform and be done with it." Chibi Usa appeared behind her father with her back against his.<p>"Stay out of my way," said her father coldly. She vanished and left the pair alone. "Don't go too far though. I want you here when I'm finished."<p>Saffron ignored her. As arrogant as she seemed, it would be child's play to lure her out later on. "You still think you can win? Don't you even realize what you're dealing with?"<p>"Yes. Someone I can cause an infinite amount of pain. I'll show you that immortality is a curse if you cross me Saffron. I'm sure that once I give you a good enough beating you'll step in line."<p>The phoenix blasted back and pushed both his palms forward. A massive ball of flames about the size of a home erupted at the thing floating in front of him.<p>Ranma merely smiled as he backhanded the projectile into the top of a nearby mountaintop. It exploded in a spectacular display that took nearly a third of the mountain off the top. "Pathetic. I was hoping for better."<p>Saffron was merely staring at him in shock. "What?"<p>"Don't you get it yet? You don't have enough power to even scratch me."<p>The god was enraged. "I'll show you power!" The giant flaming bird that surrounded him cried out, as its skin seemed to burst to life. Saffron himself could barely be seen within the creature as it flared a thousand times hotter than before.<p>Ranma merely floated back a few feet and grinned. "It's an improvement, a small one, but I suppose I can't be picky. It's not like there are a lot of easily captured and enslaved demigods on this worthless rock."<p>The angry phoenix could stand no more. With a cry of rage that shook the earth itself he rushed forward and dove towards his opponent. The giant creature opened its beak and cried out as it tried to swallow him into the flames.<p>Ranma merely put up his fist. The flames of the bird's head shattered and parted as they encountered an invisible shield. By the time the god realized what was happening, his face was planted in the man's fist.<p>Ranma shook his hand off as he watched the creature stagger back under the force of the blow. "Hurts don't it?" He shook his head and put his hand on the thing's shoulder. "You see, you really can't win kid. I'm afraid it's time to just give up. I really don't want to hurt you, just enslave your people and force them to pilot the starships."<p>"What?" muttered the god dumbly as he looked up at his opponent. He was still shaking off the last punch.<p>"Face it. You're a bit of a puss, and I'll beat the shit out of you if you keep going. Might even beat you to death a few times. Just give up. Besides, even if you manage to drive me off. My starships will blast you and your people to atoms once they arrive anyway. You might live, but it will be awfully lonely after I've wiped all life on the planet out."<p>"Monster!" growled the god as he rose to his feet and glared at him.<p>"Heh. I'm so much more than that." An aura of gold surrounded the boy and his body almost doubled in size. He simply stared forward with his cold blue eyes and smiled.<p>Saffron was on his knees as he stared at the beast before him in awe. "No."<p>"I could destroy this entire planet in a single blast. Fortunately for you, I prefer to do things the fun way. I'll destroy this rock when I'm through playing with it."<p>"I won't!" snapped the god as he punched Ranma in the face.<p>The golden beast simply turned his head. His twisted leer never even twitched. "I'll just have to break you then."<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>"We've been by that bush," grumbled Trunks.<p>"Quit saying that. We have not," replied Gohan as he frowned at his companion. Both of them were leading the hikers through the jungle. Akane and her friends were keeping up admirably just behind them.<p>"You know, it's very scenic," commented Zoicite as he brushed a lizard off his shoulder casually.<p>"I still think we'd be better off in a vehicle. There's got to be something we can get our hands on," grumbled Akane irritably.<p>"I'm certainly not enjoying this trip," growled Jadeite.<p>Nephrite merely snorted. "Genaku was cunning and brutish. I imagine his counterpart is no different. We're probably running right where he wants us."<p>"He was honorable at least," commented Kunzite.<p>"So now what?" said Akane as the two boys argued over a map just ahead of them. They had stopped and were pointing at various points.<p>"What the hell is going on?" growled Kunzite as he glared at the pair angrily. "Have they gotten us lost?"<p>"They made us dump the GPS stuff so we couldn't be tracked," said Akane as she turned towards Jadeite and frowned.<p>"I know," he replied with a sigh.<p>The girl adjusted the sleeves on her jacket. Climate control clothing was nice. They'd probably make a fortune when it was released on the market the next year, if they lived that long. "You two idiots had better not have gotten us lost." She was standing right between them when she said this. "Why am I standing in the middle of a jungle still? What on earth possessed you to bring us right to where he was going? I thought you were from the future!"<p>"We are," replied Gohan with a confused looking frown.<p>"Where are we?"<p>"Here!" replied the boys in unison as they pointed at two different places on the map.<p>"Give me that," she snarled as she snatched it from them. "We're going to have to climb and get a look at the terrain. If we want to figure out where we are I think." They were in a valley with mountains on either side of them and couldn't see very far in any direction. She glared at them over her shoulder and narrowed her eyes. "I don't like this at all. Anyone could surprise us in this place."<p>"What's up?" asked Zoicite as he jogged towards her. The others followed quickly behind her.<p>"We need to get a look around the area. I don't think these two idiots knows how to read one of these maps."<p>"And you do?" asked Jadeite.<p>"No. You guys do though, right?"<p>"Yes. All of us can," said Kunzite with a small shrug. "We were generals after all."<p>"Maps were different back then though. I've had to work with a few of these while we were working for Beryl though," said Zoicite as he stepped ahead of the others and held out his hand.<p>"Good," she replied as she handed it over. "I'm going to go and sit down while you take care of this then."<p>The men looked at the map in their hands and folded it open. It was large enough that they could all see it easily. He turned his head and narrowed his eyes at the boys. "This map doesn't cover a very wide area. It reads more like directions. Our path is marked clearly. It ends..."<p>"It's the one we were given. Sorry." Trunks shrugged his shoulders and placed the folded up map back into his shirt. "I figure they'd know where we were going." He smirked at the looks on the men's faces as he turned down the path again. It had taken them a moment to realize it was gone. "Sorry about that, but I'm afraid I can't let you have this map again." He shifted his eyes towards Gohan. "You should be more careful."<p>"I didn't see you standing up to her about this," replied the boy as he started off again. "It's this way. I know where I'm going, you're just being paranoid."<p>"Did you see where it stopped?" asked Akane as she moved back with her group. They hung back considerably."<p>"A place called Jusendo. It was easy to spot because it was written in by hand. It's very close to Jusenkyo," replied Jadeite calmly. "It looks like a long route as well. We shouldn't need to look around. I think they were just humoring your impatience by handing it over. They both know where they're going."<p>"Gohan knows anyway, I'm not sure about the other one. He seems to think we're lost." Nephrite glanced at the two saiyans. They were waiting patiently for the others to start walking again.<p>"Well, at least we know where we're going in general. How long of a trip?"<p>"Two weeks at most," said Jadeite. "Why haven't they started walking?"<p>Akane blinked. The two boys were looking quite pleased with themselves as they discussed their surroundings. It now appeared that they both realized where they were exactly. "Something is up," she said to the others.<p>"Huh?" was the general's unanimous reply.<p>"We made better time than I'd thought," said Gohan as he walked up behind the men with a wide grin on his face. "We're here already. I wasn't expecting to find it until tomorrow actually. That's why we were a little confused about where we were."<p>"We've arrived?" said Zoicite as he glanced around. "Arrived where?"<p>"You'd better be kidding," growled Akane as she rolled up her sleeves.<p>"Not where we're standing. It's passed the next hill," said Trunks as he frowned seriously and smacked Gohan on the back of his head. "Quit stalling and let's get going. We've still got to set up camp before nightfall."<p>The group walked over the small hill into even more dense foliage.<p>"We're going to be staying here for a while. There's a town nearby where we can get food and fill our needs so to speak. For right now, we're going to lay low until help arrives." Gohan tossed his traveling pack to the ground and looked back at the group. He had just stepped out of the jungle and into what appeared to be a small field at first glance.<p>"You have got to be kidding me," muttered Kunzite as he stepped out of the jungle and into the ruins of an ancient Chinese village.<p>There were dozens of small huts centered on the remains of a much larger structure. At one point there was quite a few other buildings, but most of them were nothing but broken walls now.<p>"What is this place?" asked Akane.<p>"Dead," replied Kunzite as he kicked over the last remains of a small piece of wall. "This village has been abandoned."<p>"That's right. We're going to hide out here until help arrives."<p>"They'll track us down before then," replied Jadeite as he frowned at the pair.<p>"Ranma won't come here," replied Gohan as he glanced back at them as he started taking things out of his traveling pack. "Don't think we won't be busy though."<p>"Why?" asked Akane as she looked around. "What's so special about this dump?"<p>"Because he won't be able to track us. This is a dead zone."<p>"What?" muttered the girl in confusion.<p>The generals seemed to relax quite a bit more as they started unpacking their things. "Dead Zones are areas on a planet where energy signatures are contained. Unless he's inside the field he won't be able to find us. It's a good place to hide, but nothing lives long inside the field."<p>"So it isn't safe?" muttered the girl fearfully.<p>"Sure it is. It's a natural phenomenon. Nothing grows well in these areas because energy doesn't go in or out. Most of the animals and people just leave for more fertile land. Otherwise they starve. A small village like this one can do just that without too much trouble."<p>"We're just inside the edge of one. There's a village about ten miles away where we can get supplies. It's probably the relatives of the people who lived here," said Trunks as he walked up to them. "It extends about a hundred miles to the west through this valley." He pointed and the group turned to face it. Nothing but dead trees and dirt could be seen on the other side of the clearing.<p>"My god," muttered Akane as she stared at it.<p>"Impressive isn't it?" said Zoicite as he chuckled. "A desert in the middle of a jungle."<p>"It doesn't look natural," grumbled the girl a little sourly.<p>"The universe is full of strange things," replied Jadeite as he sat down on a rock and relaxed for a moment.<p>Kunzite patted his shoulder and motioned for him to stand. "Come on. We can look at the scenery after we set up camp."<p>"Pick a hut," said Gohan as he walked into one of the more intact structures.<p>"I have a feeling this isn't going to be a very interesting wait."<p>"It'll be a chance to learn more about our two new friends," said Akane as she nodded towards the two Saiyans. "There's an awful lot they haven't explained to us."<p>"Given time I imagine they'll slip up a bit. If we combine our efforts, we may piece together something useful without having either of them realize it," said Kunzite calmly.<p>"Apparently we've got nothing but time," said Jadeite as he finally walked into the abandoned village.<p>"Wonder how long this place has been abandoned?" commented Akane as she followed the rest of the group as they followed their companion's example.<p>"Probably a hundred years or so," replied Zoicite as he turned his head to look at her. "If you really want to know the exact date you'll have to wait until we get our equipment back." All of them were armed, the boat they had taken to China was meant to function as a moving miniature base of operations. They were forced to abandon it once they hit land. Ranma knew about the boat. It had to be scuttled once they reached their destination to try and keep him from using the guidance systems inside to find them. All of the on board electronics were destroyed by them before that. They carried a lot of firepower in the black backpacks hanging from their shoulders even though it looked as if they were carrying nothing more than side arms with another rifle style weapon strapped to the side of the pack.<p>The girl sighed as she looked up at a hut that looked like it would suit her needs. "I don't even know why I believe them at all." She did though, and the confusion it caused was frustrating. She eyed a particular slab of wall near to where she was. At least she had something to take out her frustrations on later.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Look at them, aren't they beautiful," Kuroi stood up from his chair and looked at the massive screen in front of him. The starships were floating far, far away still, but they grew ever closer to him. "Soon they'll be ours."<p>"Yes," agreed Tochi as she smiled down at him as she stepped up behind him. "What of Ranma's progress?"<p>"I do not trust these phoenix people he speaks of." The boy didn't look much like it bothered him either. "Be watchful. They will not be commanding the starships, but if they turn on us they will be troublesome. How many are there anyway?"<p>"Around nine hundred."<p>"Half of them will be in fighters," added the boy calmly. "I don't like this. Youma are too costly to manufacture, we'll only have a few hundred by then. Keeping them in command positions is our only option. All those successful energy gathering operations of yours are paying off now though."<p>"We have little choice," replied Tochi as she brushed her golden locks out of her face and continued to stare into the monitor. "Besides, once we destroy the senshi and that boy."<p>"Don't forget, our man may still lose. I have a feeling that the other one isn't just sitting around up there. He's training as well."<p>"That's why you haven't stopped our friend?" she asked coyly.<p>"Yes. I may regret it before this is over."<p>"I have a feeling he won't be much trouble for us," she said calmly.<p>"He's not trustworthy."<p>"He is strong though, the perfect stock for our race to become even stronger."<p>The boy chuckled. "Oh. I see. Don't get your hopes up. If he's weak enough when the battle is over, I intend to kill him myself, regardless of who wins. If it's too much trouble to bother with at the time I'll allow you to keep him for a little while before we dispose of him."<p>The woman frowned at him. "Well. I hope the battle goes well then."<p>"It should pose no problem," replied the child calmly.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma had Saffron by his throat. The birdman was making gurgling noises through his shattered neck as his eyes bulged and stared forward in terror. "Really Saffron. I expected much more. You're not really a god you know, just a pathetic excuse for an immortal. If you were a god I'd probably have half of heaven storming this place by this point."<p>The god's arms flailed to life again as the nerve connections reestablished themselves. He gripped at the thing's arms even though doing so caused blisters to appear on his fingers and hands.<p>"Do you think they heard you down below when you begged me for mercy, pleaded for me to finally kill you? I have good news boy, your suffering is over, for now." He tossed the body on the ground in a heap after he broke his neck yet again. "You're getting low on power. I don't think you'll be able to keep reviving yourself any longer. Tell your people, I am their new god."<p>Saffron was barely able to breathe. He simply wheezed on the ground in a broken heap that slowly started to reform itself. His eyes gave everything away. He simply had no fight left in him.<p>"Good boy," said the saiyan as he turned his eyes towards his approaching daughter.<p>"I see you over did it."<p>"It will take him longer to forget this way. If he remains alive he'll grow stronger and start thinking he can take me. I'll probably have to remind him this way periodically actually. If it becomes too much trouble I'll just destroy him. Any who resist his command to surrender are to be executed immediately. Hunt them down and destroy them. Now go."<p>She growled at him as she turned towards the two birdmen that she had forced to come with her. They were cowering in fear with their eyes locked on their former god.<p>"You heard him. Follow his commands or die a horrible and painful death. Try to run away and I'll hunt you both down."<p>The pair nodded and spread their wings. They rose into the air and quickly flapped away. The woman had captured them and dragged them both there forcibly when she'd found them cowering in the forest below.<p>"Kuroi. I have them," said Ranma into his watch as he ignored her.<p>The boy's calm voice replied from a small earpiece. "Excellent. Take them to their village and I'll have a team there shortly. They need to be trained."<p>"I've got the list of jobs. I'll have them separated by the time you arrive."<p>"How many do we have?"<p>"My estimation is around nine hundred men."<p>"What of women and children?"<p>"That isn't wise. If we treat them too badly they'll fight much harder against us. Revolt would be bothersome at this point, best save that sort of thing for later, when they've outlived their usefulness. They need to be treated as well as we can treat them within our timeframe."<p>"What?"<p>"We're giving them galaxy class starships and fighters. You figure out the rest."<p>"Heh. Point taken."<p>"Once I get some information I'll find a way to make them a little more comfortable than they were under Saffron. If we play our cards right we'll get him with us instead of merely using him as a puppet to show off our power."<p>"Explain," stated Kuroi.<p>"Give them privileges over the humans. Make them think they are a ruling class. They'll help us keep them under control. Eventually they'll try to be rid of us, once they grow arrogant enough to think they might be stronger. I've given us a few years tonight at least I think."<p>"Heh. I like this," said the boy calmly.<p>"I thought you might," replied Ranma coldly. "I've got business to attend."<p>"I'm watching you."<p>"I know," he replied as he looked up at the sky and grinned.<p>"Those two cowards should have found their friends by now," said Chibi Usa as she walked up behind her father and smirked.<p>"Go with them to spread the spirit so they get the point. Don't kill any if you don't have too. We need them alive, and in relatively good condition. We're about to turn all of them into a ruling class."<p>"What for?" snorted the woman irritably.<p>"Having numbers is always a plus," he replied calmly. "If we treat them correctly, we'll have their loyalty. Fear is strong for motivation, but for loyalty you must satisfy their most basic desires."<p>The woman frowned as she glared at him. "What? We have to feed them?"<p>"Fool. How can someone so stupid really be my daughter?" he grumbled to himself. "I said desires, not needs. Give them power over something that's too pathetic for you to notice. Rule them firmly, but let them play all they want with the humans. They'll keep the population that remains after this well under control. After all, everyone desires power. We rule them, and through them the planet."<p>"A noble class?"<p>"Now you're getting the point."<p>"How quaint," she growled as she glared at the jungle below them.<p>"Nice is for another day though. Today we show them what suffering is, and then we'll forgive them for having such a weak god and allow them to follow us. I don't want a single one to escape alive. I also want enough left of any you have too kill so they can be identified by the others and counted. I'd like to have the exact number when I see you again." Deep down inside him, he felt a little proud of the grin he received in reply to that as she floated into the sky. "Too bad she's so stupid."<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks wasn't really in all that good a mood. He'd gotten suckered into the party he was sitting at. He didn't need connections with Sailor Moon around. She could fix all the stupid damage to the planet anyway. He knew that of course, but Azusa seemed to want the girls to meet some of his friends for some reason.<p>There were quite a few familiar faces in the crowd, as well as a few he hadn't seen before. It was quite crowded in the ballroom and he simply floated above the mess in a corner. He was casually gazing through the faces and keeping an eye on things in general. Mostly because he was so bored.<p>The Senshi were actually hanging around with Azusa and talking with some of the dignitaries from the planet. He was introducing them to various people by calling them over and letting the girls watch whoever it was kiss his ass. Nabiki wasn't with them though, and that struck him as odd. She was standing off in a shady looking corner and appeared to be doing the same thing he was really.<p>Tenchi was stuck between Ryoko and Ayeka. The pair was not speaking to each other and glared at each other angrily despite the boy between them. Trunks grinned at him and waved. The boy hung his head down even lower.<p>"He'll get over it," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"I'm kinda feelin sorry for him," said Ranma nervously.<p>"Do you want to go over there and tell Ryoko that she's not engaged to him anymore?" queried Dan.<p>"NO!" was the original occupant's immediate reply.<p>"Too late to do anything about it. Might as well enjoy the show," said Carrot as he turned their attention towards the Senshi again. Nabiki wasn't with them, which struck him as odd.<p>His grin widened as he realized who she was speaking with. She was standing in one of the more shady corners. People the Emperor would rather no one knew about. People who had grown powerful and rich enough to warrant invitations too attend important parties.<p>"Underground connections. Hope she can handle it," commented Dan.<p>"I think she can. If not, we're around," replied Carrot. "If you want useful information at a school you ask the bad kids. Might cost you a bit and you can't always trust them. I imagine she sees this as the same thing."<p>"The senshi won't stand for turning a blind eye towards that kind of people," pointed out Ranma.<p>"I think she knows that," replied Carrot calmly. "She's either going to talk with them about under the table type deals, or threaten them."<p>"Wonder which it'll be?" asked Ranma.<p>Nabiki pulled a blaster from her side and jumped out of the corner leaving two dead Juraians in her wake. She smiled calmly as she twirled the weapon around her finger and placed it back inside its holster. The crowd had stopped and she was the focus of attention. None of the guards had moved and she simply held up a small cube as she stepped up to the emperor and handed it too him.<p>He accepted it and smiled at her. "I take it my suspicions were true?"<p>"Ten million credits for an Emperor? The emperor of Jurai no less, cheap bastards," replied Nabiki. She was already surrounded by the senshi once again.<p>Azusa merely nodded his head towards the doors and two guards merely nodded and stepped outside. "I thank you for your assistance in this unpleasant matter."<p>The group of girls merely nodded and turned to look at the shocked crowd.<p>Azusa cleared his throat. "Ah, Prime Minister. Come and meet our new friends."<p>An elderly Juraian dressed in a rather colorful looking set of robes swallowed hard and walked forward.<p>Trunks snorted. "That jerk. I bet he set this whole thing up just so we'd do that for him."<p>"Actually, your friend discovered evidence of it earlier today."<p>The boy turned upside down and floated just next to Funaho's head. She was standing just below him and smiling cheerfully. "I've never seen him take a liking to anyone so quickly. I'm quite surprised in you."<p>"Guess we just grow on people like fungus or something," he replied as he continued to watch the crowd beside her. "Who was it? Mercury?"<p>"Actually I believe it was Saturn."<p>"Hotaru? You're lucky she didn't take out a few buildings trying to stop it herself."<p>"I beg your pardon, but I do have some tact. Unlike certain unnamed little boys." The girl frowned up at him with her hands on her hips. She was dressed in a purple gown and had even gone so far as to put on a little makeup.<p>"Hey Hotaru," he said as he waved at her. "You've been busy today?"<p>"Not really. I stumbled across these idiots plotting something in a hallway. They asked me if we were mercenaries for hire. They aren't here. The messes are just representatives sent by them to speak with our leader. I informed him she was the one I took orders from."<p>"Oh. I get it," grumbled Trunks. "Stupid criminals are common throughout the universe I suppose." He noted that both bodies were being carried out of the room and any fluids were being cleaned up professionally. Within two minutes the area was full of partygoers once again.<p>"Cerio isn't happy with Tenchi I see," said Hotaru.<p>The noble was standing against the wall near to where the prince was sitting. He had a deep frown on his face and was dressed in what looked like a powder blue jumpsuit. There was a short cape and the pants appeared to be bell-bottoms.<p>"What the hell is wrong with that guy?"<p>"He did lose a lot of credibility, not to mention..." started Hotaru.<p>"No. I mean his clothes! Will you look at the guy?"<p>"What's wrong with them?" asked Funaho.<p>"He looks like a complete fag! I've know gay people who'd be ashamed to dress like that!"<p>Funaho frowned at him slightly. "It's a cultural barrier I suppose. Here, such fashion is considered quite attractive."<p>"I know that. It's just creepy that's all."<p>Hotaru looked somewhat confused. "You think gay people are creepy?"<p>"All right. That's a hole with no bottom that I'm not climbing into. I like gay people fine. I just don't understand it." He glared at both women and they seemed to shrug it off.<p>"Since when are you so politically correct anyway? You've eaten people's internal organs with me before."<p>Funaho's eyes went wide as she stared at the two children in shock. "What?"<p>"That was thousands of years ago! Stop brining that up!" snapped the girl angrily.<p>"All right fine. We really do have to leave tonight. We've got to find some kind of mess to get into to get a few practice runs with before we get to Earth."<p>The girl frowned at him irritably. "I've got a few good possibilities plotted into our course. It'll add two weeks to our trip if we don't find anything. Several hostile races have planets under their control not to far from Earth."<p>"Whatever."<p>"My but you're a strange group of children," muttered Funaho.<p>"Yeah. Tenchi's one of us too. Scary huh?" said the boy as he grinned at her. He raised his arms up and pretended to reach for her with a vacant look in his eyes. "One of us! One of us! One of us!"<p>She giggled behind her hand and blushed slightly.<p>Trunks finally flipped over and floated as if he was sitting on the floor. He put his hand up to his forehead and faltered for a moment in the air. "Whoa. Head rush."<p>Hotaru merely sighed and looked away in shame. "My master is an idiot."<p>"Cerio has been glaring at Tenchi for almost three hours now. What's with him?"<p>"Tenchi's victory has changed the course of his carefully planned life."<p>"I'm starting to think Tenchi might be the end of it," replied the boy calmly. "I'm still not sure if he's stupid enough to try and beat him again. Does he have a ship?"<p>"His family commands a small fleet," replied the woman calmly.<p>Trunks's eyes lit up and he turned to glance down at Hotaru. "Neat. You might not have to alter our course after all!"<p>"What? Do you have any idea how long it took me to calculate all that and put it in the damn computer for that outdated piece of junk?"<p>"Please! George might hear you!" cried Trunks as he picked up the man's head. He was on the ground long since passed out from drinking.<p>"At least he's a quiet drunk," snorted Hotaru.<p>"He's got to loosen up a bit. All this stress can't be good for him," said Trunks as he promptly let the man fall back to the floor.<p>Funaho was a bit surprised. She hadn't even noticed that the boy was floating right over him. "Oh my. I'll have someone take him too his room." She waved to one of the guards and he rushed to her side and bent to his knees. "Take him to his room and make sure he is comfortable."<p>"Take his clothes and burn them please. I've been trying to talk him out of that outfit for months now. I think he's gone a little crazy. Maybe getting rid of it while he's out will help? Oh, and if you don't mind, could you just drop him off at the ship? His things are already onboard. I don't think he used his room."<p>"Crazy?" grumbled Hotaru. "Gee you think?"<p>Trunks looked at Funaho again and grinned. "Only a little. He's harmless, really."<p>"I don't recall ever seeing him before," commented the woman as she peered at him for a moment.<p>"Had to get a six pack into him and drag him here. He's been on that stupid ship of his the whole time."<p>"Oh. He pilots your ship?" she asked him.<p>"Yeah. I'm gonna hand the keys over to him when this is over. It's his ship really, we're just sort of borrowing it."<p>The woman wisely decided that it was best not to ask.<p>Trunks turned his head towards Hotaru. "Why didn't you get Washuu to calculate our... Say, where is Washuu anyway?"<p>Hotaru blushed and turned away from him. "She said not to bother her tonight. She wanted to go one more time."<p>"Eew. I don't see Yosho around either."<p>"He'd better show up to say goodbye to his mother," growled Funaho.<p>Azusa glanced over at her and frowned slightly.<p>"Sorry. I'm afraid I should be going now. I really shouldn't have been away from his side at all."<p>"Too bad. I hate formalities, they just get in the way of everything interesting," replied trunks.<p>"Possibly, but they too have their place in the world." With that said she left Hotaru and Trunks standing alone.<p>"Wanna go find Yosho?" asked the boy.<p>"Not really no. I think I'll get some sleep actually. I'll see you when you get to the ship."<p>The boy nodded and continued to search the crowd as she walked away. "I guess it's up to me then."<p>Trunks merely grinned as he noticed Cerio's little corner was growing interesting.<p>An attractive young girl with long white hair draped across her shoulder walked up to him. She was a little younger than he was, but not by more than a year or so. Her clothing was a sort of pale blue dress that hugged her curves. She leaned against the wall and Trunks fiddled with his watch and pulled a wire out of the side that he placed inside his ear. He pointed his wrist at the scene and grinned.<p>"Who is he?"<p>"Some low life upstart from a backwater planet. I'll take care of him." Cerio frowned at her for a moment and looked back towards Tenchi again.<p>"Brother dear, the thought maddens you doesn't it?"<p>"Something I cannot have? My own destiny swept away by a commoner? No sister, the thought never crossed my mind."<p>"He is of Prince Yosho's line. Hardly a commoner."<p>"Who are you kidding? He's never even been to Jurai before."<p>"I know. I'm finding him appealing. Ayeka is beyond my reach, but the other one. I think I can be rid of her, and maybe take her place at his side. The wife of an emperor."<p>"You know I will give you that honor," replied Cerio coldly.<p>"I believe that other boy has everyone questioning your sexual preferences, brother. Why would you want anything from me then? You want her for obvious reasons."<p>Cerio growled angrily. "I shall make you pay for that." He hid his face behind his fan and stared her down from the other side. She copied his movement almost exactly.<p>"You'll try. Really brother dear, you have no idea how long I've waited for an opportunity like this one. Soon, you'll be bowing to me."<p>"I'm afraid I'm taking care of that this evening. Sorry sister, but your position remains unchanged." He then cackled rather girlishly and went back to glaring at Tenchi.<p>Trunks lost interest in the conversation at that point. "Sounds fun. Tenchi's got his own version of the Kuno family now. Maybe we should get some of that drowned girl water for him when we get back?"<p>"Real funny," grumbled Ranma irritably.<p>"We'll file it away for later, in case things get too boring. We don't want to piss everyone off just before the big fight."<p>"Weren't we going to look for someone?" asked Pissant.<p>"We got plenty of time. This party will go for at least two more hours. We'll just head straight for the ship when it's over," replied Dan.<p>"We should go soon though. I want to get everything loaded ahead of time. We can have the palace servants take care of it while we look for him," added Carrot.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Hello mother." Yosho appeared to be standing alone in a darkened hallway. He was looking up at the moonlight in front of a window. Windows like it lined the wall giving the room its only light. He had been on his way to board his ship when he decided to stop and admire the moon for old time's sake.<p>"My son," said Funaho as she stepped out of the shadows and into the light with him.<p>"I hope the boy is ready for this."<p>"I think he is more than ready. Which brings me to the point."<p>The man stiffened up and turned to face the woman.<p>"I hear you're living an awfully lonely life on that planet down there. Not even calling your mother on occasion."<p>Yosho appeared to be petrified with terror. He was hoping to avoid this confrontation before he left.<p>"Why you've been there for who knows how long and all you have to show for it is one measly grandson? I hope he fairs better with his wives than you did with yours."<p>"What!" cried the man in shock.<p>"Haven't you mourned long enough? One grandson isn't enough."<p>"Mother! I won't be..."<p>"You have abandoned us Yosho, do not let the rest of our line do the same. You know I cannot bear another child."<p>The man turned his gaze away from her and up to the moonlight. "I do not think I can break Tenchi's ties with Jurai, if he is to wed Ayeka."<p>"And if something happens to him?" she replied coldly. "You know of the rift these outsiders have caused."<p>"Yes. The fact that it is even there, after all they have done for Jurai, is exactly why I left. I feel I have doomed my Grandson to spend the rest of his life facing it in my stead."<p>It was his mother's turn to look into the moonlight.<p>"If there are any other children in my future, they will live as their people live."<p>"So what's keeping you then?" she replied cheerfully.<p>Yosho sighed heavily. "Mother...I don't want to talk about this right now."<p>"When the hell are we going to talk about it then?" she snapped as her features hardened once again. "Don't even think about not calling me for this long ever again. I might decide to visit for a while if you don't call."<p>The man paled. "A while?"<p>"Find a girlfriend," she growled at him. "I don't care what you have to do. Stop sitting around pretending to be old! You'll die when you die, don't sit around and wait for it."<p>"Wait a minute. How do you know about all this?" he muttered as he stared at the woman.<p>"I had a little talk with Tenchi this morning. He was more than happy to talk with me, what with you telling him about his engagements and all. Really Yosho, you didn't tell him he would have to marry two women?"<p>"You didn't..." he gasped.<p>"No. Don't be silly. I had planned on keeping my eye on things for a while myself. I might decide to inform him though..."<p>"My god. All parents are evil," said Yosho dumbly.<p>"After all the shit you put me through when you were little? You're damn right!"<p>"I guess you're right," replied the old man as he scratched the back of his head and grinned at her.<p>She turned to look up at the moonlight for a moment and smirked. "Stop changing the subject. Why aren't you dating?"<p>No answer came.<p>She turned and looked at the empty hallway. A small vein popped out of her forehead.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"What?" Trunks had a large grin on his face as he hung by his shoulders from Yosho's desperate grip. The party was winding down and he was trying to find a place where he could horn in and get the girls to their ships without causing too much commotion. The senshi were pretty much attached to Azusa at the moment, everyone else was already boarded and ready to go.<p>"We have to get out of here. Right now." The man had horrible fear in his eyes.<p>"Sure. What's wrong?"<p>"My mother," replied the man fearfully.<p>Trunks looked over his shoulder and caught a glimpse of the glare the woman was giving the room as she quietly walked in the door on the opposite side of the room. "Right. Ladies! Time to go!"<p>Azusa blinked as the girls calmly stepped away from his side. "Thank you for the party Your Highness, but we have to go now." Ami bowed and followed her companions towards Trunks.<p>"What's going on here?"<p>"Guards. I am not through speaking with my son," snapped Funaho as she pointed at Yosho.<p>Azusa decided he would sit on his throne and watch the end of the party suddenly.<p>"So that's how it is eh?" muttered Trunks as he watched this happen.<p>"All right! We get to fight our way out!" said Trunks cheerfully. He glanced at the looks the senshi got on their faces as they immediately went into combat mode.<p>"Try not to kill anyone. We're diplomats remember?" snapped Nabiki at the girls.<p>"Are you insane? My mother is pissed!" snapped Yosho as he turned towards the doors and rushed out of the room.<p>"I don't care about the others. Let them go, and bring me my son," snapped the woman as the glared at the guards.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"They're using the alarms for this?" muttered Trunks with a small frown as the hallways began flashing with red lights. Word was apparently already around the palace as a large group of guards stood in front of the group. There were about thirty of them and all of them looked ready to face them bravely.<p>Yosho was the first one to charge them. He had another sword and hacked one of the guard's weapon in half. All of them were armed with wooden staffs.<p>"Please," said Trunks as he spread his arms and walked just in front of the senshi. "Yosho, you can stop now."<p>The man was still cutting his opponent's weapons in half and had not yet realized they were not resisting him any longer. All of the men were staring towards the bright multicolored light behind him. He hung his head and walked back towards them. "Can we just go? I'd rather not get caught."<p>The senshi were standing just behind Trunks with a magically charged weapon in each of their hands. All of them were armed with two forty five-millimeter handguns except Rei. She had what appeared to be a giant flaming rocket launcher resting on her shoulder. The weapons were glowing with the color of each girl's power. Nabiki was standing beside them calmly with her arm raised in the air ready to order them to fire.<p>"Put em away girls," said Trunks over his shoulder.<p>"Show off," grumbled Minako.<p>They all holstered their weapons and they strolled through the mass of stunned guards. Rei's weapon simply dissipated out of existence as she lowered her arms.<p>A few moments they were jogging through the landing pad. The girls broke off from the group and headed for their fighters.<p>Yosho and Carrot jogged on board the Mikon Taka where Hotaru was standing in the ramp waiting for them. "Nice of you guys to show up."<p>"Call the others and tell them to take off now. Yosho has to get off planet as soon as possible."<p>"What's going on?"<p>"Ignore Juraian blockades and checkpoints. Take off." He turned her towards the cockpit and pushed her forward while he turned towards Yosho. "Once we get away from the palace we're home free."<p>The man merely nodded and staggered after him into the ship.<p>"Aren't three Juraian cruisers going with us?" asked Washuu as she popped her head into the conversation.<p>"Ahhh! What the hell?" cried Trunks as he noticed her. He calmed immediately. "You're coming with us?"<p>"All of the equipment for monitoring the starships has been fitted into this starship. I'm going to have to teach you how to use it."<p>"This is George's ship. I'm giving it back when we're done?"<p>The man glanced back at him from the cockpit and blinked. He was dressed in a blue jumpsuit of Juraian design. "Really?"<p>"Yeah. It's the least I can do right? Besides, I've got other ways to get around planned for later." He grinned at her as she faltered for a moment.<p>"Oh. I suppose I can remove it then."<p>"Let him keep it. I'm sure you'll want to improve on this by then anyway."<p>"You're right," she said cheerfully. "After all, I can run the entire ship from here. It's also got an advanced diagnostics program in it. Quite useful."<p>George staggered back to the cockpit in a slight daze. Everyone but Carrot was glad they burned the outfit in the end. Carrot thought the look matched what was left of his sanity. Even if it was a little gross.<p>"Wow, that's information that might be useful later," said Trunks to no one as he smiled. His teeth actually sparkled as he winked at no one in particular.<p>"Come on. We're going to the cockpit." The boy waved his hand.<p>"Who are you talking too?" asked Washuu.<p>"Readers," replied the boy as he glanced at her.<p>"What?" said the woman dumbly.<p>"Can I talk to the readers?" asked George.<p>Trunks laughed at him. "No. Don't be silly. Only me and Hotaru get to talk to the readers."<p>"I am so not going there," said Hotaru as she frowned at him George was piloting the ship and the floor lurched slightly as it lifted off. Artificial gravity kicked in a moment later and they continued with what they were doing.<p>He waved her off and continued towards the cockpit.<p>Everyone was looking at Hotaru.<p>"What? I don't know what the hell he was talking about okay?" she snapped.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks found himself sitting next to George at the communications console just behind the pilot's seat. "Ladies. How are things going?"<p>The lead fighter was jet black and had its wings loaded down with missiles of different makes and designs. The other five fighters were the same color as the uniform of the Senshi that piloted it. Sailor Moon's ship was colored military gray at her own request. They were hot rod looking monstrosities with shining colored chrome coats. The rear of each was fitted with massive engines with several jets. The noses ended in large dual barreled laser cannons. The weaponry on each ship varied under the wings. Everything from continuous fire lasers to light or medium sized missiles.<p>"Neat," said Carrot cheerfully as he watched them pass by and take positions just in front of them.<p>"I'm picking up a transmission," said Carrot. "Things check out over there girls?"<p>"We're fine," said Nabiki calmly.<p>"Takin the other call then," he said as he flipped the switch.<p>"YOSHO!" screamed the angry voice on the other end.<p>"Ouch," muttered the boy as he pulled the headphones off. "He ain't keen on talking right now lady."<p>"Put him on."<p>"Nah. I think I just won't bother to tell him you called. G'bye."<p>"I'll charge you with kidnapping! Bring back my son! Don't make me come after you?"<p>"Heh. What the hell crawled up your ass all of a sudden lady? I haven't known him very long, but I doubt if Azusa will bite. Your will versus the fate of a planet and screwing over the people who just saved yours? Besides, he's not dumb enough to attack us."<p>"We shall see. I command a fleet of my own."<p>"What the hell did you do to your mother?" snapped Trunks into the passenger cabin angrily.<p>"I didn't call for seven hundred years," he cried from his hiding place under the table.<p>"Holy shit. She'll kill us all," said Trunks dumbly. "We gotta get out of here!"<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome frowned as he glanced over his shoulder and found Tochi standing behind him. He was standing on a rooftop looking down at the wreckage of the village. Around twenty of the bird people had to be destroyed, before they took control of the village. Quite a few were seriously injured when they tried to run, and he had medical teams from his base flying in to care for them. He needed them in good condition. There was already a team setting up the training area just outside the village.<p>"What?"<p>"It's time. Come with me," she said simply as she turned away and floated into the air.<p>He grinned darkly and floated up after her.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Four hours later Ranma was standing in a large room filled with glass tubes. Inside each one was a small crystal that were growing into what appeared to be humans. The ones close to where the pair was standing at the front of the room were the most developed.<p>"Not very original," commented Tochi. "Still, it is your first one, it's always a special moment."<p>"Yes. I suppose that it is," he replied simply as a wet looking man in a black suit and tie stepped out of the only drained tube right in front of them. He calmly put on a pair of shades and said nothing as he simply looked at them both. His features offered no expression at all. His hair was short and black, slicked back and greasy looking. His features were nothing more than a permanent frown.<p>"Agent Smith, how very nice to meet you."<p>"Yes sir," replied the thing stonily.<p>"Agent Smith?" asked the woman in confusion.<p>"Yes. Why do you think I chose this particular design? Easy to manufacture, intelligent, strong, and fast. He's basically and upgraded human clone with no free will and has the magical ability of a standard Youma. Plus, he'll blend in with the humans easily until he's provoked."<p>"What happens then?" she asked him as she ran her fingers down the creature's chest.<p>"If you're thinking transformation forget it. His intelligence is his real asset. He's also strong and fast enough to handle almost anything his line of work can throw at him. Plus, he's more than willing to die to complete an objective. I got the idea from a movie actually."<p>"A movie?" said the blonde as she wrapped her arms around his chest from behind him.<p>"Yes. These will be commanding the starships and running sensitive areas. Two months is not enough time to allow these creatures too much power. I intend to hold their leaders onboard the starships to help ensure the fighters don't turn."<p>"Are you sure that will be enough?"<p>"Does it matter?" he replied calmly. "I for one don't intend to go anywhere near those starships until the planet is well under our control."<p>Smith continued to stare as Tochi put her chin on his shoulder. He hadn't even tried to speak since his introduction.<p>"What are you going to do with him?"<p>The boy merely snorted as he narrowed his eyes at the thing. "I'll have ten more of him by tomorrow, with seventy five total by the end of the week. The rest will take a bit longer. I'll probably go through a few of him, but I think I'll use him to help contain the mess my daughter left in China. I want those phoenix people to get used to taking orders from him as well. Plus he'll be able to keep those fools hiding in China out of our hair while we operate there. He can sense their energy and is drawn to it."<p>"You mean?"<p>"He's not finished growing yet Tochi. All of this, is just one Youma. Impressive ne?"<p>"I thought you growing some Youma for yourself was a bit odd."<p>"Impressed?"<p>"Very. No wonder it took you so long to create just one. Kuroi was even starting to think you were having trouble with our instructions, or gave up."<p>"I'm not sure if this will make him more comfortable with our plan, or just make him more paranoid."<p>She kissed him on the neck playfully and said nothing. She wasn't really sure which of them would win when it came down too it. It would be very interesting to find out if nothing else.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"What's going on? Why are they turning toward us?" asked Nabiki sharply. As she glared at the tiny screen on her console that showed Trunks grinning at her. Everyone in their group had on a headset and was listening in. The Senshi actually had theirs built into the helmets they wore. Trunks also had the original communications equipment for the ship turned on as well and had an open line to Jurai. Yosho was standing just behind him with his arms folded over his chest.<p>"We may have to shoot our way into deep space. Hold on, I'm working on it," replied the boy.<p>"Azusa? Hello?" he called into the microphone on his ear as he switched channels again.<p>Within seconds the Emperor was glaring at him angrily. "What is the meaning of this?"<p>"Your wife has gone insane and is trying to make us come back. I'm not really sure what made her snap, but I think it was something Yosho said."<p>"I am aware of that," he growled impatiently. "Hurry up and bring him back. She'll calm down in a few days or so."<p>"Sorry my friend. Order your ships away or I'm gonna go through em," he replied calmly.<p>"What?" growled the man.<p>"You really don't want me and my lady friends to blow up your nice shiny and expensive starships do you?"<p>Tenchi's head popped up on the console in front of George. "When did we put a video screen here?" Muttered the man as he flipped one of the switches. Tenchi's head appeared and he looked quite worried. "What's going on? Grandpa, Are you all right?"<p>"I'm fine boy. Are you on course?"<p>"Yes. We left right after you did. I'll be there in a moment. The captain of your ship decided to follow once we got word that you were off planet." replied the boy.<p>"Yes. I've been looking forward to meeting you again," interrupted the Juraian man behind Tenchi. "Hello Yosho."<p>"Yosho, I have your grandson," replied Azusa. "Those ships will return on my command."<p>"My orders haven't changed yet. I'm still under the personal control of the Emperor himself. Even the empress can't order me about at the moment. As much as I'd like to see you again old friend, I'm afraid I must follow his command."<p>"I understand. Tenchi, do not worry yourself if you are forced to remain behind."<p>"I won't stay behind long if we do turn back," said the boy firmly. "In fact, I have no intention of going back even if the Emperor orders it."<p>"It is not your choice boy," replied Azusa calmly.<p>"Well don't tell him about anything while we're gone then!" snapped Trunks irritably. He'd grown tired of the family bickering. At least Ayeka had enough sense to ignore it, she'd probably prefer to stay on Jurai. Ryoko wouldn't care either way as long as Tenchi was there. He paused and thought about it. She'd want to leave as well, just to keep Ayeka on level ground.<p>He hadn't heard from any other ships yet and the large starships that had appeared in front of him seemed to be simply waiting for them to come into range. He switched to the senshi for a moment again and put Azusa on hold. "Lock and load ladies. We're getting kind of close." He quickly flipped back to find the man glaring at the screen angrily.<p>The ships outside the cockpit shifted and folded, making themselves even sleeker looking as the turrets elongated and shifted. The other weapons systems came to life as well, moving up into ready to fire positions on the wings if they needed too.<p>"I demand that you desist!" roared the man angrily.<p>"Call your ships off Azusa, if anyone starts firing at me I'm going to leave an awful mess behind up here."<p>Tenchi and the captain looked rather nervous.<p>"What?" muttered the Juraian man dumbly from behind the boy.<p>"I will do nothing. My wife has ordered you stopped, and she will deal with these matters herself." The transmission ended.<p>"Man. He's whipped so bad," said Trunks as he adjusted the frequency once again. "Well ladies. Looks like we get our first taste of real combat a little early."<p>"I am nothing of the kind!" snapped Azusa's voice angrily. "Those ships belong to my wife. I do not have the power to order them away. I can only ask her and I am not going anywhere near her right now."<p>"Oops, forgot about the audio!" said the boy cheerfully. It was quite obviously a lie.<p>"What?" stammered Nabiki dumbly. All of their weapons were armed and the girls gave a collective gasp. Ami merely stared forward calmly and seemed too ignore everything.<p>"Are you insane?" cried Minako. "We can't... I mean..."<p>"We just saved their entire planet and his mother is going to kill us if we don't get away. How grateful do you think they are now, huh?"<p>"Not nearly as grateful as they'd be if you'd just left him behind," snorted Nabiki angrily.<p>"I don't think she'd kill you," corrected Yosho. "I imagine she'd probably want to torture you a bit though. Just you personally, Trunks."<p>The boy glared back at the doorway again. "You stay out of this!<p>"What the hell are we doing? Just take him back!" snapped Minako.<p>"No," said Usagi softly.<p>Everyone went silent and turned their attention towards her.<p>"This is his fight too. You heard him, Earth is his home."<p>"Thank you," replied Yosho.<p>"Wow. We sure talked a lot," said Trunks as he turned towards the window of the cockpit. "Scoot over man, I'm driving for this."<p>George fumbled out of the way as the boy planted himself in his seat. He shifted over to the co-pilot's seat and buckled himself in very securely. "I suggest you do the same," he said to Yosho.<p>"Freighter, this is Captain..." The transmission was ended rather abruptly.<p>"I'll take this call captain. Hello boy." Cerio was looking at them smugly from behind a fan.<p>"Hiya!" said Trunks.<p>"I am taking Prince Yosho back to Jurai. Prepare to be boarded."<p>"If you try, we're gonna blow up your ship," replied the boy calmly.<p>"Ship? Don't be foolish. I command three Juraian battle cruisers, and three wings of fighters. Surrender or be subdued. Even if my fighters are unable to support you, the Queen's fleet is sitting in front of you. There can be no escape for you this time."<p>Trunks snorted and pointed at the intercom. "Subdued? Get a load of this jerk girls. Would you please remove this asshole from my presence?"<p>"Gladly," replied Nabiki.<p>"Are you sure we should be doing this?" muttered George nervously.<p>"They're gonna blow up your ship if you don't do it," replied Trunks.<p>"There is no other choice!" agreed Yosho with a serious frown on his face.<p>"Cut it out. This is all your fault you know," said Trunks as he frowned at the man. "Not that I'm not enjoying it."<p>Yosho sighed and nodded his head. "I see."<p>"We'll be there in a moment Grandpa!" cried Tenchi angrily.<p>"No boy. You continue your course. We'll catch up. I do not think the captain or crew will be very cooperative about facing their own fleet.<p>"You're right. I couldn't ask that of them. I wasn't thinking," replied the boy somberly.<p>The captain looked incredibly relieved at hearing this. "I'm ending the transmission and cutting off communications. I'll find out what happened when I return." The man was obviously not pleased, but seemed to have some grasp of the situation.<p>"We should take him back to avoid this confrontation," warned Washuu.<p>"Bah," replied the boy as he waved his hand at her.<p>"It will damage the relationship you just formed if you embarrass the planet this way," warned the scientist.<p>"She's right," said Hotaru as she poked her head into the conversation as well.<p>"It's getting a little crowded in here. You should be manning the guns. The senshi don't need Jurai, I'd just as soon have them cut ties with this place before they pick up any of its bad habits. At least until Tenchi takes over and cleans things up. With all the training I have him it shouldn't be a problem. I'm not keen on staying myself, we need to get back and the red tape involved with something like this will keep us here for a long time if we wait for them to let us leave anyway."<p>"A wise decision," said Yosho calmly.<p>"You shut up. You're calling your mother when we get back."<p>"You can't..." snorted Yosho as he frowned at the boy.<p>"You wanna bet?" he replied calmly. "I've got five little soldiers I'm sure would be more than glad to help me do it too."<p>The man walked out of the cockpit followed by the others. Hotaru and Yosho manned the guns while Washuu took her place at her station. "Three Juraian battle cruisers? I don't think those ships are Tenchi and the others."<p>"What are our chances?" called back Trunks. He had turned on several screens and was looking at the faces of Nabiki and the Senshi on six small screens.<p>"Are you kidding?" snorted Washuu. "Those shields are nothing to scoff at, but our weaponry should penetrate no problem. After all, each girl's power is the battery for the weapons systems. The ship itself works as an amplifier actually. Only Nabiki's ship has a separate power source for the weapons systems."<p>"Cool," said Trunks as he grinned at her image.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>There were four large cruisers in front of them and three behind them. It was one hell of a tight spot. Dots began to appear out of the giant ship's belly as the fighters launched.<p>"They're trying to subdue this ship. I've got a feeling destroying yours is optional, especially once we start returning fire. Our mission is to escape ladies, other than Cerio and his ships I'd rather avoid casualties if we can avoid it. Fighters are fair game though." He began to flip switches on his console and set both his hands on the controls. Warning lights flashed on the console and he glanced over at George.<p>The man was simply sitting there, petrified with horror at the coming onslaught of ships.<p>"Here they come," said Nabiki as she steeled herself. Trunks dove down into a roll and the fighters veered off in two groups to the right or left. Ami and Rei went left after Nabiki, while Usagi led the others in the opposite direction.<p>All of the fighters dove after Trunks.<p>"We could just leave him you know. He'll probably think of a way out of this himself," commented Rei.<p>"No one gets left behind. Not even him. Don't forget the others on board," replied Nabiki.<p>"I know, just thought I'd bring it up," she kicked in her after burners and spun around a hundred and eighty degrees in an instant. The other ships performed the same maneuver and lost the few fighters who had been launched to tail them. The larger ships were closing in all around them and were spreading out to surround them.<p>"We need to keep a door open," said Nabiki. "Girls, figure out which ship has that pink haired idiot on it and keep him from getting into position."<p>A laser bolt streaked towards Nabiki's ship and she rolled away. "That one," she growled as she caused a target indicator to appear on all of their screens. "He's been listening I think."<p>"Gee you think so Ma'am?" snorted Minako.<p>"You just volunteered for that mission, I want Hino on your wing. The rest of us will keep the Mikon Taka covered. Let's go to work."<p>"That's enough," said Yosho firmly over the intercom. "I shall return home. I did not think she would take this so far."<p>"What? Aw, man!" cried Trunks.<p>Everyone else breathed a sigh of relief as the fighters broke off suddenly.<p>Trunks halted and jumped out of the seat to go give Yosho a piece of his mind. He paused as he realized the position he was in at the moment. That jerk had ruined a perfectly good space battle.<p>He jumped up and began working at the console.<p>"What are you doing!" cried George in horror.<p>"Your orders sir?" said Minako as she appeared on screen. None of the Senshi had stopped and herself and Rei were both still charging Cerio's ship.<p>"Stop. I guess I can't make criminals out of you. It's his decision in the end," replied the boy simply as he continued to work at the console. The ships stopped charging and turned towards his position. "By the way ladies, see you when we get there." He promptly shoved a few levers forward and the stars began to streak across the sky.<p>"Stop them!" cried one of the desperate commanders of the starships.<p>It was too late though the ship was long gone.<p>"Prince Yosho has escaped!" verified another transmission.<p>"Impossible!" cried Cerio angrily.<p>"That asshole left us!" snapped Minako.<p>"Actually, they were only sent to retrieve Yosho," pointed out Nabiki. "We should go before their orders change. The six ships blasted out of the ring of command ships in an instant. Trunks had transmitted the information into their ships just before he made the jump.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Yosho was staring at the boy in horror. "What are you doing? I surrendered!"<p>"You aren't in command of this ship. I am," replied the young Saiyan as he kicked his feet on top of the table and stretched out. "We need to slow down a bit. Cerio has a trap waiting for Tenchi, so we need to double back and meet up with them. I don't want the girls to get to Earth before they kill something. I'm still not certain how some of them will react to it at first. They might not care, but I'm not willing to bet on it. I'm pretty sure it will bother Minako and Usagi at least a little bit once they realize what they've done. Ami's about as lethal as she's going to be. Rei and Makoto probably won't mind much."<p>"I'm not entirely comfortable with that," commented Washuu.<p>"He is right, we can't have one of them freeze up with emotion in the heat of battle. It's best to get into a small skirmish first. I've got a feeling that we'll be diving right into things when we arrive," said Hotaru calmly.<p>"I suppose you're right," replied the scientist as she continued to work at her console. "The Senshi's ships will power down when they catch up to us. We'll have to wait a few minutes for them to arrive."<p>"Do not blow this off boy..." growled Yosho.<p>"Don't you get it? You're off the hook. I kidnapped you. I didn't tell you I was calculating this jump when things got quiet for a reason."<p>"What?" stammered the man dumbly.<p>Trunks pointed at a small lens near the front of the cabin. It was poking out of the wall.<p>"Washuu is sending this to Jurai. It's encrypted, so the ships around the planet won't pick it up. I'm sure it will find it's way into your father's hands in a day or so though."<p>The woman waved at him cheerfully.<p>"That doesn't excuse the abuse of my honor!" snapped the man angrily.<p>"You'll forgive me in an hour or so when you realize I'm right," replied the boy with a small shrug. "Sit and think about it for a while. Tenchi should be following the coordinates we originally set, so he'll be easy enough to catch in about an hour or two."<p>"What was this about a trap?" asked Yosho.<p>"That idiot prince wants to pick a fight with Tenchi. I imagine he'll attack his convoy and target his ship specifically. Wants to be rid of him to get his 'destiny' back or whatever. I'm sure we'll have plenty of fun blowing him up for it. How are the girls doing anyway?"<p>Washuu smirked at him. "Playing cards, sleeping, going over battle data. I think Nabiki is still a little miffed at Cerio for shooting at her. It was the only shot fired in the whole skirmish."<p>"Man. How annoying," grumbled Trunks. "I kinda wish we could go back, but I suppose they'll all be gone by then anyway."<p>Yosho sighed and hung his head. "How did I get into such an odd position."<p>"You didn't call your mother for seven hundred years, that's how. Honestly man, what's wrong with you?"<p>Hotaru narrowed her eyes at the man and he stepped away from her.<p>"Anyway. Here are the girls. Give them our new coordinates and rendezvous with Tenchi. Look for good ambush spots along our planned route and change our route through them. I want to catch him with his pants down. I leaked our travel plans just before we left."<p>"What?" muttered Hotaru.<p>"I 'accidentally' included our full route when I transmitted our course to the senshi. All the Juraians probably picked it up. This short escape jump was hidden in the transmission."<p>Yosho glared at Washuu. "You did this?"<p>"Well. I had a little help, but what you don't know won't hurt you," replied the boy simply.<p>Washuu simply blushed and sank a little deeper into her chair as she purposely rotated it away from Yosho.<p>"I give up. Tell me when we meet my grandson. I'm going to sleep until I get my own ship."<p>"You wanna go back to Jurai then it's your call," said Trunks with a small shrug. "I don't have time for delays like that. Sorry."<p>The man glanced back at him and nodded with a slightly thoughtful frown. "I suppose I understand then. I will remain, it is already too late to do anything about it now."<p>"I'm sure your grandson will be happy to hear that. He'll feel better knowing you're with him to help," said Hotaru as she leaned against the wall and closed her eyes.<p>The young saiyan boy merely hopped to his feet and walked back towards the cockpit. "If I don't get to blow up something soon I'm gonna go nuts," he muttered under his breath.<p>"Little warmonger," growled Hotaru without much heat in her voice.<p>"Yeah. Like you're not looking forward to putting your fist into Chibi Usa's skull," he replied simply as he rounded the corner and left them sitting there.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Ah, the action begins again finally; Akane and friends 'Enter The Matrix' so to speak, and Cerio does something really stupid, and pays for it! Next time on Insertion! ^_^
