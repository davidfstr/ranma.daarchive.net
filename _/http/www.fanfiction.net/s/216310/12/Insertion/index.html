</div>Insertion<p>Part 12<p>Ranma's new friends.<p>++++++++++++++<p>It was an average day for Ranma Saotome, one week after his battle<br/>with the Senshi; he'd managed to avoid any other altercations thus<br/>far. He was walking through the streets on the outer edge of Nerima,<br/>simply enjoying the day. His clothing was what had become normal for<br/>him over the past few weeks, black slacks, shined shoes, and a button<br/>up Chinese shirt. He was also wearing his shades and whistling to<br/>himself as he walked. He seemed quiet, and calm, but in reality there<br/>was a heated discussion going on inside his head.<p>"Let me get this straight, you think we should just die?" muttered<br/>Ranma angrily.<p>"If it means we don't have to hurt anyone, then yes," snapped the<br/>new voice.<p>"The hell we will! You can't stop all of us!" snarled Dan<br/>irritably. "We'll fight whether you like it or not!"<p>"Look Pissant, we're going to survive," commented Carrot.<p>"Yeah, quit your whining, or I'll kick your ass again, Pissant,"<br/>agreed Dan.<p>"I still don't think that's a very good name," grumbled the voice<br/>irritably.<p>"It suits you. Hey, babe," said Carrot as he turned their head to<br/>watch a particularly attractive passer by.<p>"Pervert," grumbled Ranma irritably.<p>The woman turned her head and smiled at them as she noticed their<br/>gaze. Carrot gave her a small salute as he continued on his way. "Lay<br/>off Boy Scout, she doesn't mind us looking."<p>"What did you call me?" snapped Ranma angrily.<p>"Shut up, both of you," grumbled Dan.<p>"Yes, being a Boy Scout is an honorable tradition dating back..."<p>Carrot slapped them.<p>"Thanks," commented Dan.<p>"Would you just stop talkin already?" snapped Ranma at Pissant.<p>"Welcome," commented Carrot as he continued to stroll down the<br/>street. He paused and looked around for a moment. "What's this?"<p>There was a rather nasty looking group of children huddled around<br/>what appeared to be a vicious beating.<p>"Freak!" cried one of the little boys. He paused when he noticed<br/>the shadow standing over him. Ranma Saotome was cracking his knuckles,<br/>and glaring down at all of them.<p>"What the hell do you little shits think you're doing?"<p>That caught the attention of the entire group. They all looked up<br/>at him for a moment.<p>"Mind your own business! This little freak of nature..." said one<br/>of the boy's angrily as he raised his fist to strike the child huddled<br/>on the ground.<p>Ranma simply lifted him up by his shirt. "That little freak of<br/>nature what?" he asked coldly.<p>The remaining children scattered like roaches.<p>"You had better have a really good explanation for this punk,"<br/>said Ranma.<p>"I...I..." stammered the boy in terror.<p>Ranma looked down at the child who was still lying in a protective<br/>ball. "You all right kid? Hey kid..." He gently shook her arm, and she<br/>shuddered for a moment, pulling herself into her protective ball a<br/>little tighter. "Oh man." He picked her up and held her gently in one<br/>arm, she was pretty badly bruised, and had a little blood coming from<br/>the corner of her mouth.<p>"Hey! I know this girl!" he muttered under his breath. "Hotaru?"<p>The kid in his other hand was shaking visibly, and clutching at<br/>his arm in a desperate attempt to escape.<p>Ranma turned to look at him and frowned. "Where do you live kid?"<p>++++++++++<p>"Who are you? What are you doing with my son?" gasped the woman<br/>who met him at the door of the child's home.<p>"My name is Ranma Saotome, and I thought I'd show you what your<br/>son was doing to this little girl," he replied as he looked down at<br/>the girl who was sleeping soundly in his arms.<p>"What?" gasped the woman in shock as she stared down at Hotaru in<br/>horror. "You're saying that..."<p>"I found him beating on her with about six other kids about two<br/>blocks from here," he replied calmly.<p>"I should call the police, you can't..." started the angry mother.<p>"If you do, I'll make sure her family presses charges against your<br/>son," replied the boy calmly. "I'd like to keep the police out of this<br/>at the moment. If I see this again, I'm taking him in myself." He<br/>turned away from her, leaving her standing in the doorway with her jaw<br/>hanging open.<p>As he walked away, she heard a loud smack, and the familiar<br/>wailing of a young child. He grinned to himself as he carried Hotaru<br/>to a park bench and set her down next to him.<p>After a few moments, she woke up and gasped as she looked around.<p>"You feelin all right?" he asked her.<p>She blinked and looked up at him in terror. "Who...?"<p>"Relax, I'm not gonna hurt ya. Why were those kids beating you<br/>up?" he asked with a small smile.<p>"It's...nothing..." she muttered quietly.<p>"Yeah, those healing powers of yours must be pretty scary to<br/>someone who's never seen stuff like that before," said Ranma with a<br/>small chuckle.<p>The girl looked up at him, her eyes wide in shock. "What? You<br/>mean...you know...about...?"<p>"I know a lot of stuff," replied the boy with a shrug. "You'll<br/>make a really good doctor one day. If that's what you want to do with<br/>your life."<p>"I..." It was becoming painfully obvious that she was very shy.<p>"I'll tell you a secret, I've got a special power too," he said as<br/>he gave her a small wink.<p>"R...really?" she muttered as she looked up at him.<p>"Yeah, it's not as neat as yours though," he commented as he<br/>looked up at the trees for a moment.<p>"Do people beat you up because of it too?" she asked quietly.<p>"Naw, I'm too strong for em to beat," he replied with another<br/>wink. "Come on, I'll walk you home."<p>She moved away from him, slightly nervous.<p>"Can you walk okay?" he said gently.<p>"Yeah," muttered the girl as she jumped off the bench and almost<br/>fell over. She staggered back to her feet, and appeared to be fine<br/>after that.<p>++++++++++<p>"Who are you?" asked Hotaru's father as he stared at the boy.<br/>"Hotaru! What happened? Who...?" He fell down to his knees and pulled<br/>her into a hug.<p>"A bunch of punks a few blocks from here. She's lucky I ran into<br/>her," said the boy with a small grin.<p>"Those boys again? It's never been this bad before..." said the<br/>man with a frown on his face.<p>"Have you considered putting her in a self defense class? I<br/>noticed a dojo nearby that teaches Karate." asked Ranma with a small<br/>frown.<p>"I would, but she's so young. I'm afraid she's not very healthy<br/>either, she's a very fragile child," said the man as he hung his head.<br/>"I must thank you."<p>"Fragile huh? Aikido would be good," said Ranma as he appeared to<br/>ignore the man's thanks and peered down at the little girl. She was<br/>hiding behind his leg.<p>"Pardon?" said her father dumbly.<p>"I live at a dojo in Nerima, I'm gonna inherit it someday<br/>supposedly. My name is Ranma Saotome, and I'm the heir to the Anything<br/>Goes School of Martial Arts. The style itself isn't very good for<br/>someone like her, it requires a lot of strength and energy. However,<br/>I've mastered several softer styles, ones that don't require a lot of<br/>effort, but are very effective."<p>"You mean..." muttered the man as he looked down at her.<p>Ranma smiled at him. "I could do it for free. It would only take<br/>about an hour, maybe three or four times a week to teach her a little<br/>self defense."<p>"Excuse me, it's a nice offer, but I don't want my child turning<br/>into one of those bullies," said the man nervously.<p>"Naw. I wouldn't worry about that much. The styles I have in mind<br/>aren't very useful for offense. Mainly defensive stuff really,<br/>blocking punches, redirecting attacks, things like that."<p>"It's very kind of you, but..."<p>"I hate to sound pushy, but I want to do it. Especially after what<br/>I saw. This is a once in a lifetime offer, unless your born into it,<br/>free martial arts is unheard of. If you're doubting my credentials, I<br/>could bring some references by later."<p>The man blinked at him, and then looked down at his daughter<br/>again. She was still blushing, and hiding behind his leg. "All right,<br/>bring some references by, and we'll talk."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Why did we do that?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"Hotaru is probably the most powerful of the Senshi. We've got<br/>quite a while before she becomes Sailor Saturn, but if we have her as<br/>an ally rather than trying to kill us..." said Carrot with a small<br/>chuckle.<p>"What's this about references?" asked Dan.<p>"Remember when Ranma told us about those dojo he trained at while<br/>he was still in Japan?"<p>"Yeah?" asked Ranma. "What about em?"<p>"Those are our references. We're gonna go around and visit a few<br/>of em tonight," said Carrot calmly.<p>"I think this is so sweet, but we should really be teaching her<br/>how to talk her way out of..."<p>The trio smacked themselves, causing Pissant to become silent<br/>again.<p>++++++++++++<p>Three days later...<p>"Yeah, that's it," said Ranma as he smiled at the young girl.<br/>"You're getting it!"<p>"It's hard," muttered Hotaru as she looked at her hands. She was a<br/>very spoiled child, and didn't like doing much if she didn't have to.<p>"It takes a long time to learn it right, but it gets easier the<br/>more you do it," said Ranma cheerfully as he knelt down beside her.<br/>"You'll feel better, and you won't be so tired so often."<p>"So. I'll be normal one day?" asked the girl.<p>"I can't promise you that you'll grow as strong as other kids<br/>will, but you'll be able to stop people from hurting you. One day, if<br/>you practice enough, no one will be able to hurt you, not even me."<p>"Why would you do that?" asked the girl fearfully.<p>"I wouldn't. But someday, I won't be able to, even if I did want<br/>to."<p>"Oh. Okay Saotome-sensei," said the girl with a small sigh.<p>"Ready to try again?" he asked gently.<p>"I guess so..." she grumbled.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Well, that was fun," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"God, what a brat," muttered Dan irritably.<p>"She's just not used to this sort of thing. You saw her room, I<br/>thought my brain was going to explode. I've never seen that much pink<br/>before," muttered Carrot with a small frown.<p>"I thought her room was pretty," commented Pissant.<p>"Speaking of which, we should start practicing more ourselves,"<br/>commented Ranma.<p>Dan nodded in agreement. "He's right, we're good at dodging thanks<br/>to our job, but we're going to need some new attacks."<p>"Some sort of chi blast?" asked Carrot.<p>"Yeah, right. Like it's just that easy!" snorted Ranma angrily.<p>"Well...maybe it is?" asked Dan with a small shrug.<p>"Have we ever tried?" agreed Carrot.<p>"Well...no..." said Ranma dumbly.<p>+++++++++++<p>A short time later, they were standing in the middle of the park.<br/>It was getting late, and the area was mostly deserted.<p>"All right, here's the way we do it," said Carrot as he made them<br/>face a tree.<p>"You know what you're doing?" asked Ranma dumbly.<p>"I know the basic idea," replied Carrot with a small frown. "It's<br/>the weight of the emotion. Find the emotion you feel the most of, and<br/>use that. We've got to work on focusing it."<p>"Right," chimed the other three voices cheerfully.<p>"How do we do that?" said Ranma with a smug looking grin crossing<br/>his face.<p>"According to what I've read, we focus it in our abdomen, here."<br/>He poked them in the stomach, and closed his eyes. "Then we will it<br/>into a ball by forcing it out of our hands. It's some sort of<br/>willpower, and mind focus thing."<p>All four of them concentrated at the same time.<p>A tiny ball of light formed in their hands, it grew very slowly,<br/>until it was about the size of a golf ball. It swirled different<br/>colors, blue, red, white, and yellow.<p>"Whoa!" gasped Ranma in wonder as he stared at it. He lost his<br/>concentration, and all the yellow faded out of the ball.<p>"Ranma! We're losing it!" said Carrot as the ball faded away.<p>"We should try that again," commented Dan as he looked at their<br/>hands for a moment.<p>"Right, but what now? I mean, it was just sitting there."<p>"Push it away with your mind, kinda throw it at something<br/>mentally," said Carrot.<p>"Right," said the other three.<p>After a moment, another ball of light formed in their hands. They<br/>willed it forward, and something completely unexpected happened.<br/>Rather than shooting the tiny ball of energy away, it erupted into a<br/>huge beam of light, almost as big as they were tall.<p>"WHOA!" cried Carrot as he and the others cut the beam off and<br/>stared forward dumbly. "What the hell?"<p>The tree had taken the brunt of the blast, and was unharmed.<p>"It looked cool, but didn't do much," said Dan irritably. "In<br/>fact, I don't think it did anything."<p>"What's that?" asked Carrot as he walked them over to the tree and<br/>looked down. On the side of the trunk, where the blast had struck, a<br/>small sprout was quickly growing into a tiny branch. It was fast<br/>enough to be visible. "Cool. What emotions were you guys using?"<p>"Confidence," said Ranma.<p>"Anger, what else?" snored Dan.<p>"I was using sarcasm," commented Carrot.<p>"That's an emotion?" asked Ranma.<p>"I guess so, it worked," replied Carrot with a small shrug.<p>"I think it was my fault," said Pissant sheepishly.<p>"Huh? Howzat?" muttered Dan. "What the hell were you using?"<p>"Peace and love," said the girlish voice cheerfully.<p>"Well, that would explain it. All right, let's try this again,<br/>without Pissant," grumbled Carrot.<p>"No! We'll hurt the baby tree!" cried Pissant.<p>Dan smacked them again.<p>"Stop that! I don't want too kill the little tree branch on it's<br/>birthday!" whined the voice.<p>"Fine! Damn it, we'll just use another tree," grumbled Carrot.<p>"Mmmmmm..." Pissant seemed like he'd start crying.<p>"A dead one! Are you happy now?" snapped Carrot irritably.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Moukou Takabishi!" cried the trio in unison as they incinerated a<br/>dead stump, and a large area of the ground behind it. The blast struck<br/>the ground, and blasted a huge hole in the ground in a massive<br/>explosion.<p>"C...c...cool..." said Dan.<p>"Wow," agreed Ranma.<p>"It's too big," said Carrot with a small frown.<p>The beam had been a little smaller without the four of them, but<br/>the results were much closer to what they had desired.<p>"Whatever," grumbled Dan irritably.<p>"I think it works like the Kaio Ken. It gets stronger when we all<br/>do it," said Carrot with a small frown.<p>"Makes sense, I mean, we weigh about four hundred pounds, and our<br/>attacks get stronger when we do them together," agreed Ranma.<p>"We weigh how much?" gasped Pissant in horror.<p>"We figured it out a while back, our weight is the same as the<br/>three of our original body weight's combined," said Dan.<p>"Wait a minute, there's four of us now. How much does he make us<br/>weigh?" asked Carrot as he thought about it for a moment.<p>"It's like we're four separate people, jammed together somehow.<br/>It's really weird. We haven't discussed it much, but do you guys<br/>realize that it's like we're, I dunno...roommates?"<p>"That is weird," agreed Dan. "We can sleep at different times,<br/>when one of us gets knocked out, the others don't. We can even combine<br/>our strength to attack things, or attack separately. This is a weird<br/>situation."<p>"That could mean that we might be able to separate ourselves one<br/>day, if we find the right way to do it," said Carrot with a grin<br/>forming on his face.<p>"Yeah? Well let's start lookin!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Like we haven't been?" snapped Dan irritably. "This is nice and<br/>all, but we've got to get home soon. We've got school tomorrow, and<br/>then work, and now martial arts lessons."<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Once again, about half way to the Dojo, a familiar old friend<br/>stopped Ranma.<p>"So, at last I find you Genaku McTome!"<p>He looked up and frowned. Nephrite was hovering in the air over<br/>his head, and smiling at him.<p>"Hey, how's it goin Nephrite?" he asked casually.<p>"I've come for your life," snarled the man angrily as he stared<br/>down at him.<p>"Huh? What for?" muttered Ranma as he looked up at him.<p>"I'll never forgive you for what you've done," he snapped.<p>"Come on, don't be like that buddy, it isn't like you to hold a<br/>grudge," said Ranma as he crossed his arms and frowned at the man.<p>"I am not your buddy!" snapped Nephrite angrily.<p>"So, you want to fight?" snapped Ranma with a frown on his face.<p>"I want to destroy you!" snarled the evil general angrily.<p>"Okay, but how about this. If I win, you forget about this stupid<br/>thing, and make up nice like."<p>Nephrite paused and frowned at him. "What?"<p>"Come on. I don't wanna spend all my time fighting you too. I've<br/>got enough problems with those stupid Senshi," he said as he looked up<br/>at the general for a moment.<p>"You needn't worry about that," snapped the man coldly. "After<br/>tonight, you'll never fight again!"<p>"So, is it a bet then?" said Ranma with a smirk on his face.<p>"Always one for games," replied Nephrite with a chuckle. "Very<br/>well. I should warn you though, my power has been increased a hundred<br/>fold by Queen Beryl. You do not stand a chance."<p>"Great!" said the boy cheerfully as he took up a combat stance.<p>"What?" gasped Nephrite in shock. Genaku wasn't much of a fighter<br/>without his sword in the past, he was strong, and a good brawler, but<br/>seeing him take up a martial arts stance was a little odd to him. He<br/>snorted and waved it off. "Go my minion! Destroy him!"<p>Ranma blinked, and a large dog like creature appeared in front of<br/>him. It was pitch black, and had several horns protruding from its<br/>head. The thing bared its teeth at him and growled.<p>The boy blinked, and picked up a nearby stick. He began to<br/>whistle, and shook the twig in the air. "Here boy! Wanna fetch the<br/>stick?"<p>The thing cocked its head and looked at him for a moment. It's<br/>long whip like tail moving violently from side to side.<p>"Go get it boy!" cried Ranma as he tossed the twig away and into<br/>the darkness.<p>"What the hell are you doing? Destroy him I said!" cried Nephrite<br/>angrily.<p>"Aww, isn't that cute?" commented Ranma as the thing gave chase<br/>and went after the stick excitedly. He glanced up at Nephrite and<br/>grinned. "You done yet?"<p>"Die!" snarled the general as he raised his hand and at him with a<br/>dark energy. It slammed into the ground where he had been and<br/>exploded. "What?" gasped the general when he realized that he had<br/>missed.<p>"Surprise!" said Ranma as he appeared behind him and punched him<br/>in the back of his head.<p>Nephrite was thrown forward, and clutched at his head painfully as<br/>he floated in the air. "How?"<p>Ranma was in front of his face again. "Give up yet?"<p>"Die!" cried Nephrite as he shot another blast of dark energy at<br/>him at point blank range. He saw the boy's aura flare before he<br/>vanished again, dodging the attack. "How can this be? He wasn't this<br/>fast in the past!"<p>"I've learned a few new tricks. Wanna see my latest one?" said<br/>Ranma as he appeared in the air beside him with his hand held out.<br/>There was a small ball of light in his palm, pointing directly at<br/>Nephrite's head. "Or do you want to stop this before one of us gets<br/>hurt?"<p>"What?" snarled the man angrily. "I will not lose!" He tried to<br/>turn and strike before his opponent could release the attack.<p>Ranma snorted, and blasted him in the head. The general was<br/>knocked out of the air, and was now lying on the ground.<p>"That was only at about one third strength Nephrite. Come on,<br/>can't we be pals again? The others still like me."<p>Nephrite tried to jump to his feet, but the boy put his foot on<br/>top of his neck and applied a little pressure.<p>"Please?"<p>He growled under his breath, and shifted his eyes away. "You're<br/>stronger than I remember you."<p>"Well, I've got my old memories, and this new life too," replied<br/>the boy as he stepped back and offered his hand. "I think I'll just<br/>sit back and watch this time. I don't care to get involved."<p>"You'll have to pick sides soon enough," said Nephrite coldly.<p>"I'll probably go with whoever is winning at the time then,"<br/>replied the boy with a small shrug. "Nothing for you to worry about. I<br/>figure I've got plenty of time."<p>"Not as much as you think," growled Nephrite coldly.<p>"Maybe, but I like where I'm at now. I don't want to work for<br/>Beryl, she doesn't like me much anyway," said the boy with another<br/>indifferent shrug.<p>"Heh. I imagine that she still remembers that time you filled her<br/>palace water supply with 'Lime Jello'."<p>"Yeah. She had to take a bath in that stuff for like a week. It<br/>took months for her skin to turn white again," replied Genaku with a<br/>small chuckle.<p>"Heh. Unlike me, she does hold a grudge," said Nephrite with a<br/>small frown.<p>"Whaddaya mean? It's been millennia since that happened!" said<br/>Ranma with a small frown. "It wore off eventually."<p>"It was my wedding night! I had to spend three days of my<br/>honeymoon waiting for it to wear off!"<p>"Sorry. I didn't mean for you to get that upset," said the boy<br/>with a small apologetic grin. "C'mon. You know I didn't mean any<br/>harm."<p>"I suppose," muttered the man as he turned away from him.<p>"We're supposed to get together again in a couple of days. You<br/>gonna be there this time?"<p>"You promise not to use a star cruiser as our ride home this<br/>time?" said Nephrite with a small frown.<p>"I would if I could, but..." said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"I suppose there isn't much you can do now," said the general with<br/>a small frown. "I suppose I could attend."<p>"Great. See ya then," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"I suppose so," muttered Nephrite as he faded into the shadows.<p>Ranma paused as the giant dog youma appeared next to him, it was<br/>wagging its tail excitedly and had the stick in its mouth.<p>Nephrite appeared again. "Come on!" he snapped at the dog thing.<p>It whined and followed him into the vortex.<p>Ranma shrugged and continued to walk away.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>"Your mind is just as important as your body Hotaru," said Ranma<br/>sagely as he sat across from the girl in her backyard.<p>"Yeah, but meditating is boring," she groused.<p>"Not if you think about what you're supposed to. You can't just<br/>sit quietly, there's more to it than that. You've just got to learn to<br/>focus."<p>"How do I do that?" asked the girl in confusion.<p>"Okay, we'll start with something easy. I want you to think about<br/>your favorite thing in the world."<p>"Huh?" said the girl in surprise.<p>"Go ahead, try it," he said cheerfully.<p>"Okay. How about...my teddy!"<p>"That could work, anything you want," he replied with a small<br/>shrug.<p>She sat with a grin on her face as she visualized the stuffed<br/>bear.<p>"How do you feel?" he asked her.<p>"Fine," she said as her train of thought was interrupted. She<br/>frowned a bit at the question.<p>"No, about the bear. How does thinking about it make you feel?"<br/>said Ranma patiently.<p>"Oh. It makes me feel warm, and safe," she said cheerfully.<p>"Okay. Think about that feeling," he said with a grin forming on<br/>his face.<p>Hotaru did, she felt the warmth growing through her entire body.<p>"Good, think about everything that feeling does to you. How it<br/>makes your body feel, every little thing that feeling does to every<br/>part of your body."<p>"Wow," she said cheerfully as she did. "I never knew it did so<br/>much!"<p>Ranma smiled, and waited as she sat across from him in wonder.<br/>"Well, you're meditating now."<p>She blinked, the feeling fading away from her body in an instant.<br/>"I was?"<p>"Yup," he replied cheerfully.<p>"That's all there is?" she said in confusion.<p>"No, there's more, but that's the basics. You should practice<br/>that, and after you're really good at it. You'll be able to move on to<br/>other things."<p>"Like what?" she said in confusion.<p>"Oh, like being able to tell where other people are with your eyes<br/>closed, sensing danger, knowing about every part of your body, making<br/>it so pain goes away, lots of things," he said with a small shrug.<p>"I can make stuff stop hurting?" she said in wonder.<p>"After a while, yes, to some extent," he replied cheerfully. "If<br/>you get really good, someday you'll be able to do things like this."<br/>He held out his palm, and a small white ball formed there.<p>"Wow!" she gasped. "Is that your special power that you told me<br/>about?"<p>"No, this is something else," he said cheerfully.<p>"Can I touch it?" she said as she reached forward.<p>"Sure, this one is made of peace and love," he said as he put his<br/>hand down to her. "It can't hurt you."<p>"You can make ones that hurt people too?" she said with a small<br/>frown.<p>"Well, you can, but you don't have too," he said with a shrug.<br/>"It's up to you."<p>"Oh," she said with a small nod.<p>"Will you teach me how?" she said tentatively.<p>"Sure, if you practice your meditation every day. I suppose you<br/>could learn in a year or two," he said with a small shrug.<p>"I can't wait!" she said cheerfully as she put her hand through<br/>the ball of light. "Wow. I don't feel tired at all."<p>Ranma smirked at her. "This one kind of works like your power<br/>does," he said cheerfully. "It can sort of heal things, make things<br/>grow, and basically makes you feel stronger."<p>"So, can you do that all the time?" she asked.<p>"If I want, but being tired is good for you. If I just healed you<br/>all the time, you'd never get any stronger."<p>"Oh," she said in slight disappointment.<p>"Don't worry Hotaru, it's a lot of work, but it's worth it," he<br/>said cheerfully.<p>"Yeah. Thanks Saotome-sensei," she said with a grin.<p>"Now, let's go over that kata once more," he said to her.<p>"Okay," she grumbled as she stood up and began.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>
