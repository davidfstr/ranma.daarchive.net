</div>My name is Ranma, and I am insane.<p>Near as I can figure it, the year is somewhere around 10,000 BC.<br/>I'm stuck on an interstellar spaceship, probably waiting to die.<p>It all started with that damn spring. Jusenkyo, the training<br/>ground of cursed springs. It awoke something, something dark.<p>It got into my head and it went bad, now I've got three idiots<br/>living in there besides me. Then, they took over my life.<p>We started a secret organization to protect the earth, fought with<br/>Youma and Senshi alike. Doing pretty good too. Then the Senshi got us<br/>back.<br/>Big time.<p>"You know Ranma, I'm starting to regret letting you watch that<br/>movie," said Carrot flatly.<p>"Yeah," agreed Dan.<p>"Well I'm bored, can't we train or something?" muttered Ranma in<br/>retort.<p>Carrot looked around; they were barely able to stand inside the<br/>ship, much less anything else.<p>"Oh, right," muttered the boy irritably.<p>"All right, what's the sit-rep?" said Dan with a small sigh.<p>"Well, we're in the past, looks like the Silver Millenium," said<br/>Carrot. "We appear to be in the middle of some sort of conflict. Which<br/>is good."<p>"Good?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"Sure. You know how these things go. Soon we'll be up to our ass<br/>in explosions and fights," said Carrot.<p>"I'm game for that," commented Dan.<p>"If I'm reading this right, we'll have all kinds of little side<br/>adventures. Probably get shot at a lot, have to rescue the princess a<br/>few times, and then end up in a massive space battle against a huge<br/>starship that threatens to destroy an entire planet."<p>"That doesn't sound very fun," said Pissant nervously.<p>"Don't worry, you'll get into it," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"You forget who you're talking to," said Dan.<p>"Oh. Right," muttered Carrot.<p>"Ouch!" they all cried at once as something hit them on the side<br/>of their head.<p>++++++++++<p>"I said hand me that wrench!" snapped Hanna angrily as she stuck<br/>her head out of the small trap door in the floor below them.<p>"Sorry," grumbled Ranma as he reached out with his hand and the<br/>correct tool floated into his grasp. "Here."<p>The woman was too busy to notice this as she was currently working<br/>on a part of the ship's engine. "Tell me what happened again?"<p>"This ship wasn't designed to jump that suddenly. We knocked out<br/>the warp driver when you almost got me killed!" snapped the woman<br/>bitterly.<p>"Oh, you really should get a regulator for that," said Ranma as he<br/>peered down at the mess of wires below.<p>"Not all of us can afford things like that!" snapped the woman.<p>"You should relax more," commented the boy with a small frown as<br/>he looked at her angry face.<p>"Are you out of your mind? I've got an intergalactic princess on<br/>my ship! I'm being hunted by every military in the system! I'm just a<br/>working girl trying to make ends meet! I shouldn't have to deal with<br/>this crap!"<p>"Let me get this straight. You're on what's probably the biggest<br/>adventure of your life, rescuing a princess no less, and you're<br/>bitching because of your lousy job?" said Ranma flatly.<p>"I like my crappy job damn it!" snapped the woman as she glared up<br/>at him. "I was happy, content! Until you came along and made me one of<br/>the most wanted criminals in the Universe!"<p>"Um, you guys should come up here," said Serena as she stuck her<br/>head around the corner for a moment.<p>"Huh?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"Now what the hell is it?" snarled Hanna angrily.<p>++++++++++<p>The pair walked into the cockpit and frowned at what they saw.<p>"Bloody hell," muttered Hanna.<p>"Hey, that's a battle cruiser, a big one too," said Ranma as he<br/>saw the large ship bearing down on them.<p>"What are all those little things?" said Usagi as she noticed<br/>several smaller objects coming out of the hull of the ship. They<br/>looked like little gray triangles.<p>"Fighters," said Ranma calmly as he sat down at the console.<p>"We're gonna die!" said Hanna desperately.<p>"You're almost done fixing that right?" asked Ranma as he looked<br/>back at her for a moment.<p>"No!" she snapped.<p>"Better get moving then," he replied with a shrug.<p>"Gahhh! What the hell are you planning?" said the woman as she<br/>grabbed the back of his shirt.<p>"I'm betting they won't ask any questions either, at least not<br/>until they blow this ship apart first."<p>"That's not good right?" muttered Serena nervously.<p>"No it isn't," replied Hanna with a defeated look on her face.<p>"Here they come," said Ranma as he turned on the ship's engines<br/>and shot forward into the first formation of fighters. They broke<br/>apart, firing lasers at them as they moved by. They were almost<br/>triangular in shape, but with a flat nose. They were also somewhat<br/>wedge-shaped.<p>Ranma spun the ship on its axis and put the engines on full. "Sit<br/>down and strap in."<p>Serena did so without question, a cheerful smile on her face as<br/>she buckled herself in.<p>"Don't look like you're having so much fun. You're gonna piss the<br/>captain off," he said without looking back at her.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Hanna worked desperately as the ship lurched violently around.<br/>Occasionally it would shake from a blast from some of the lasers fired<br/>by the fighters outside; it was remarkably rare though.<p>Tears flowed down her face as she worked. "My life is over, I'm<br/>gonna be a criminal forever!" Another explosion sounded outside,<br/>signaling the demise of yet another of the Imperial fighters.<br/>"Wahhhhhh!"<p>The ship jolted again and she jerked her head up just in time to<br/>miss a toolbox falling on her. She blinked and looked around for a<br/>moment. "That wasn't a laser blast. Something hit us!"<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"What the hell is going on up here?" snapped Hanna as she rushed<br/>into the cockpit.<p>"Asteroids," replied Ranma calmly as he pointed at the floating<br/>field of rocks outside. The star fighters were still buzzing about and<br/>shooting at them, but were much harder pressed to keep up. They were<br/>still on the outer edge of the field, and the large starship was<br/>closing in on them.<p>"We're...doomed. They've got us cornered now," said the woman as<br/>she hung her head in defeat.<p>"I wouldn't say that," said Ranma calmly as he turned the ship.<p>"What the hell are you doing you crazy son of a bitch!" screamed<br/>the woman as she clutched the back of his chair.<p>"Going in," said the boy calmly.<p>"Wait. Did you just say that we're flying into an asteroid field?"<br/>said Serena as she turned to look at him.<p>Ranma just nodded as he piloted through several of the larger<br/>stones.<p>"She's right! You are nuts!"<p>"Well, they'd be crazy to follow us," he replied.<p>+++++++++++<p>"What the hell are they doing?" said the captain on the bridge of<br/>the battle cruiser.<p>"Sir...they're going into the asteroid field!" said one of the men<br/>below him at one of the workstations.<p>"Those crazy sons of bitches! They've got the princess on that<br/>ship! Go after them! Stop them!" cried the captain. "Get me a readout<br/>of the makeup of that field!"<p>One of the men was already doing it. "Sir, that field is mostly<br/>iron and...carantium."<p>"What?" said the captain in shock. "Tell those pilots no firing! I<br/>want those weapons locked!"<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma was whistling to himself as he turned the ship and narrowly<br/>missed being crushed by two large asteroids that collided, crushing<br/>one of the fighters behind him. He wasn't paying much attention to<br/>what he was doing, because he was looking at a readout on the screen<br/>in front of him. "Hey, this is a carantium field. Neat."<p>"What?" said Hanna as she turned to look at him. Her face had gone<br/>completely white.<p>Serenity was siting quietly next to them. She had an iron grip on<br/>the dashboard and was simply staring foreword in terror at the chaos<br/>outside.<p>Hanna opened her mouth to speak and almost passed out as the<br/>surface of one of the asteroids passed no more than a foot above them.<br/>One of the fighters tried to follow and was destroyed by a protrusion<br/>from the stone.<p>Serena spoke up suddenly. "I'm almost afraid to ask, but what's<br/>carantium?"<p>"High explosives," replied Ranma casually. "Heh. I knew all those<br/>hours of 'Wing Commander' would pay off one day." He turned to look at<br/>the pair for a moment and smiled cheerfully. "I'm gonna move closer to<br/>one of the big ones."<p>"Closer?" stammered Hanna. She finally slumped to the ground.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Your Highness! We have cornered the ship, but they have entered a<br/>large asteroid field, and we dare not go after them..."<p>Serenity's holographic image narrowed its eyes at the man and she<br/>scowled. "I want that ship Captain, not excuses."<p>"Yes, Your Highness," he muttered nervously. "They must have been<br/>destroyed by now though. There isn't much we can do..."<p>"They are alive Captain. I know my daughter has not died yet.<br/>Bring her back to me."<p>The transmission ended, leaving the unfortunate man standing there<br/>alone. He swallowed and turned back to the entrance to the bridge.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Where am I?" muttered Hanna as she looked around at where she was<br/>lying.<p>"Bout time you woke up," snorted Ranma calmly. He was sitting on<br/>the counter in the living area of the ship. It was a small room with<br/>about four beds lining the walls, and a small table. There was also a<br/>kitchen area about four feet wide on one wall.<p>"We're alive?" gasped Hanna in shock.<p>"Yeah. You never told me you had Anti-matter missiles," he said<br/>with a lopsided grin.<p>"What?" she stammered dumbly.<p>"I found 'em earlier. You had them hidden under one of the secret<br/>panels along the floor. I thought you weren't a smuggler?"<p>"I'm not, but I go through deep space sometimes. They're illegal,<br/>but Pirates tend to leave you alone if they know you've got them." The<br/>woman blushed and turned away from him for a moment. "Where are we<br/>anyway?"<p>"Inside one of the bigger asteroids," said Ranma with a small<br/>shrug. "I think your warp driver is a little more than burnt out. We<br/>need a new one. Let's see if we can find a disturbingly convenient<br/>place nearby where we can get it fixed." He motioned for her to follow<br/>and walked over to a computer screen at the table.<p>Hanna blinked and nodded as she stood up and walked over next to<br/>him.<p>"Hey! Lando!" said Ranma cheerfully as he pointed at a spot on the<br/>screen and grinned.<p>"It's just the name of a comet," she replied flatly.<p>"I know, it's sort of a private joke," he replied with a small<br/>shrug.<p>"Where are we anyway?" she muttered angrily.<p>"Well, our jump brought us to the outer rim of the Solar System,"<br/>said Ranma with a small shrug. "We're in the orbital ring of Pluto,<br/>but the planet is on the other side of the solar system right now."<p>"Are there any space stations near here?" she muttered as she<br/>typed a few buttons on the keyboard and frowned suddenly. "Yes.<br/>Karin."<p>"Station?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"No, he's the name of this guy I know," she said with a small<br/>blush on her face. "He's on this station, it's a sort of resort near<br/>Uranus's orbit. We should be able to make it."<p>"Told ya," said Ranma as he looked at Serena and smirked.<p>"How did you know that?" muttered the girl as she handed him a few<br/>bills. "Are you some kind of psychic or something?"<p>"Nope. Seeing the future is hard. Always in motion is the future,"<br/>replied Ranma with a cheerful smirk. He turned towards Hanna next.<br/>"Can we trust this guy?"<p>"No, he's a jerk, and a pervert, but he is an old friend. He<br/>should help us out," said Hanna with a small frown. "He's also our<br/>only option."<p>"Well, I guess we should go then," said Ranma with a small nod.<br/>"We'll wait here a few hours and see what we can do with it until<br/>then. They should stop searching after a while, thinking we were<br/>destroyed or escaped."<p>++++++++++<p>"It has been too long my Queen, they must have been destroyed by<br/>now. We can find no trace of them," said the Captain nervously as he<br/>looked at the image of the Queen again.<p>"No. They are alive still," she replied calmly.<p>"Then they have escaped. They could have been lucky enough to get<br/>through the other side of the Asteroid field and warped away. We'd<br/>have no way of knowing."<p>"Very well, Captain," replied the woman coldly. The transmission<br/>ended again and the man breathed a sigh of relief. He had halfway<br/>expected her to order him to send his ship into the field with the<br/>fighters.<p>"Sir! We've found them!" cried one of the crew as he walked onto<br/>the bridge.<p>"What?" gasped the man in shock.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Shit!" cried Ranma angrily as he flew through the increasingly<br/>dense field of stone. Hanna was beside him, sitting uselessly at the<br/>co-pilot's station.<p>"Where did you learn to fly like this?" she muttered with a little<br/>jealousy in her voice. Three fighters had been destroyed behind them.<p>"I had a long time to learn," replied Ranma calmly as he dove<br/>downward along the surface of a particularly large asteroid. He<br/>pointed forward and smirked. "There! It's starting to clear up!" He<br/>pushed the engines to full once again and shot ahead of the swarm of<br/>fighters behind him. Many of the pilots were quite skilled, and had<br/>managed to make it through the field with them.<p>"They're still after us!" cried Serena nervously.<p>"Not for long they aren't," said Ranma as he suddenly stopped the<br/>ship and spun it around on its axis.<p>"What are you doing?" muttered Hanna as she looked at him for a<br/>moment.<p>"This!" cried Ranma as he flipped the safety cover off of one of<br/>the buttons and jammed it down. A missile blasted from the front of<br/>the ship. As it streaked away he spun the ship around again and shot<br/>forward as fast as it would go.<p>"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!" cried Hanna and Usagi as they realized<br/>what he had just done. There was a bright explosion behind them, it<br/>missed all the small fighters and went into the field.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"What the hell is he shootin at?" commented one of the men as he<br/>watched the missile go by. That was when he realized that the shot had<br/>gone directly to where it was intended.<p>++++++++++++++<p>The captain of the battle cruiser looked on in horror as the light<br/>slowly engulfed the entire asteroid field. "No..." He turned towards<br/>the crew and started screaming. "Evasive maneuvers! Evasive<br/>maneuvers!"<p>The entire ship was rocked and thrown violently as the explosion<br/>finally reached them. After a long moment the shaking stopped and the<br/>bridge hands slowly staggered to their feet.<p>"Damage report," muttered the captain.<p>"Sir. We aren't going anywhere for a while," said one of the men<br/>as he looked at the screen.<p>"What?" said the man angrily.<p>The man stepped away from his station and allowed the Captain to<br/>move in. The engines and a small portion of the rear end of the ship<br/>on the readout was now covered in red. "What's that?"<p>"That's the part of our ship that isn't there anymore, sir."<p>+++++++++++<p>"Man, that was so cool," said Ranma happily as they moved away<br/>from the scene at high speed. The blast had narrowly missed them and<br/>he was laughing and cheering as they rocketed away. After a moment he<br/>paused and turned to look at the pair beside him.<p>Hanna was frozen with tears streaming down her face. "I'll<br/>never...my life is over! I'm doomed to be on the run forever!"<p>"Are we...still alive?" muttered Serena as she began to feel her<br/>body as if to check.<p>"Man, you guys gotta lighten up a bit. So, where is this place<br/>anyway?" He turned towards the woman and smirked.<p>++++++++++++<p>Deep in space, a small ship floated aimlessly. Inside, Sailor<br/>Jupiter sat against the pilot's seat with her arms crossed in front of<br/>her chest and her eyes closed. The screen in front of her suddenly<br/>came to life, bathing her face in green light. She opened her eyes and<br/>frowned at what she saw. "So, that's where you went," she commented.<br/>"Give me a readout of any spaceports near that area."<p>It was a short list. Jupiter smiled and uncrossed her arms.<p>+++++++++++<p>"They wouldn't have shot at us if you didn't insult them!"<br/>screamed Hanna angrily as she stepped out of her ship with Ranma and<br/>Serena. The pair were both wearing long brown cloaks that hid their<br/>identities.<p>Ranma looked at her and blinked. One of the patrol ships that had<br/>escorted them to their landing port flew by overhead. It had two round<br/>engine ports, and a long nose that stuck out in front of them. The<br/>cockpit was at the base of the nose, nestled in-between the two engine<br/>ports. "Look at it. Tell me that doesn't look like a giant..."<p>"Greetings," said a tall and rather bishonen looking man who<br/>strolled up to them. He had guards on either side of him, they were<br/>armed with rifles and wore black body armor. The man himself had long<br/>blonde hair and a pastel colored purple shirt with a long cape on his<br/>shoulders. "Welcome to my humble place of business."<p>Ranma's face suddenly became very serious as he stared at the man<br/>for a moment.<p>"Hi Karin," said Hanna with a small sigh. "I need some help here.<br/>My warp driver is out."<p>"Of course," said the man cheerfully. "Seeing as we're old<br/>friends, I'll only charge you half the usual rate."<p>"Huh?" said the woman in surprise.<p>"Not good," commented Ranma coolly.<p>"What do you mean?" said Serena in confusion.<p>"The way she reacted to him saying that? He's up to something,"<br/>replied the boy calmly. "Stay close to me, don't wander off."<p>The princess blushed and immediately latched onto his arm.<p>"Not that close," he said as he looked at her for a moment. "I<br/>might need to use that arm."<p>She smiled sheepishly and let him go. "Well, at least it's<br/>something."<p>"What's up?" said Hanna as she stepped back with them as Kairin<br/>led them through the bustling halls of the spaceport.<p>"He's up to something. I can smell it," said Ranma coolly.<p>"He's always up to something. That's why we broke up," said the<br/>woman with a sour frown. "He's probably just thinking I came crawling<br/>back to him or something."<p>"No, it's more than that," replied the boy calmly.<p>"What are you? Some kind of psychic?" she grumbled angrily.<p>"I don't need to be to see that man is up to something," groused<br/>Ranma irritably.<p>"Well, he's fixing the ship. So don't complain," she commented as<br/>she turned to look at him for a moment.<p>"Are you sure?" said Ranma flatly.<p>"There's men working on it now. See for yourself," said Hanna as<br/>she pointed out one of the windows they were moving by. Sure enough,<br/>there were several men moving about the ship with equipment.<p>"Ah, here we are. I thought you might like a bit of refreshment<br/>while you waited," said the man cheerfully.<p>The doors opened and a man dressed in a long black cape stood up<br/>on the other end of a long table. He had short spiky brown hair, and a<br/>long scar running at an angle across his face. "We would be honored if<br/>you would join us," he commented.<p>Ranma merely smirked and nodded his head. "See, told ya."<p>"Valdis!" gasped Serena in horror as she recognized the man.<p>Hanna growled and turned towards Kairin. "You! You set us up!"<p>"They arrived before you did," replied the man with a small shrug.<br/>"I had no choice."<p>"You've been looking for us?" asked Ranma as he watched the black<br/>clad man for a moment.<p>"That fool Serenity sent a description of your ship out across the<br/>entire galaxy," said the man coldly. "We've been keeping an eye out<br/>for you since then. Luckily, we stumbled across you on your way here.<br/>After hearing about what you did to that Imperial Battle Cruiser, we<br/>thought it might wiser to set up an ambush here."<p>Several guards appeared outside the doors to the room and they<br/>closed, leaving them trapped inside with the two men.<p>"What do you get out of this?" snapped Hanna as she looked at<br/>Karin.<p>"Why it's fairly simple. My business is undisturbed by this little<br/>war, and I get to keep your ship."<p>"Bastard," she growled.<p>Ranma raised his hand and she grew silent.<p>Valdis smirked and looked at Serena for a moment. "I've heard<br/>quite a bit about you my friend. You took out a group of our best<br/>assassins, and have been leading the Imperial forces around by their<br/>tail ever since you saved the young princess."<p>"Then you know it isn't wise to be sitting in the same room with<br/>me this way. It might hurt," replied Ranma coolly.<p>"Hmmm, that's not important any longer," said the man with a small<br/>shrug. He raised a small blaster from under the table and fired two<br/>shots.<p>Ranma's hand shot up and the two bolts struck his hand harmlessly.<br/>The blaster flew out of Valdis's hand and landed in Ranma's.<p>"What?" gasped the man in shock.<p>Ranma was merely smirking at him, after a moment, he dropped the<br/>blaster onto the ground and jumped up from his seat holding his hand.<br/>"Damn! That really hurt!"<p>Hanna had the weapon in her hand a moment later and trained it on<br/>Karin.<p>"Now, darling. You know I would never do anything to hurt you! I<br/>was going to have you stay here, as part of the deal!" he cried.<p>Hanna narrowed her eyes and shot him in his face.<p>Valdis was now very nervous, he edged back in his chair slowly.<p>Ranma raised his hand and the chair moved back up against the<br/>table, trapping the man where he was. "You know, you've got no idea<br/>what you're dealing with do you?"<p>He shook his head violently as he stared at the man in horror.<p>"What should I do with you now? You wouldn't have lasted long<br/>against the Imperial army anyway. This is pathetic. You should have<br/>had armed guards in the room with you. It was stupid to bring us in<br/>here alone."<p>"You'll never get out of here alive," said the man as he narrowed<br/>his eyes at them. "My guards have this place surrounded. Surrender<br/>now, or..."<p>"Surrender?" said Ranma with a small smirk forming again. "Why<br/>would we do that? I mean, we've got the perfect hostage."<p>"No!" muttered the man as he began to shake visibly. He looked<br/>down at himself as he wet his pants and stared at the trio with<br/>pleading eyes.<p>"This is the great Lord Valdis?" muttered Serenity in disgust.<p>"I hope not," muttered Ranma irritably.<p>"You'd be correct then," said a voice from a speaker within the<br/>room. "This pathetic fool is nothing more than a double. A face for<br/>the masses to see."<p>"You must be Valdis," said Ranma as he looked around.<p>"Yes, I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you," said<br/>the voice casually.<p>"Name's Ranma," replied the boy.<p>"Well, I'm certainly impressed. Guards, kill them all."<p>The door opened and a mass of black armored men trained their guns<br/>into the room.<p>"Well shit," muttered Ranma as he looked at them.<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>
