</div>Insertion<p>Part 6<p>Who is Captain Destructo?<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma stood over Kuno's fallen form with a smirk on his face. "You<br/>got it today?"<p>"I have not forgotten your ill gotten payment," snorted the boy on<br/>the ground. He reached into his robes, and pulled out a wad of money.<p>Ranma took it cheerfully and stuffed it into his own pocket.<br/>"Well, here you go, the only copy of yesterday's humiliating defeat.<br/>Today's defeat will be on sale tomorrow, for the low price of only ten<br/>thousand yen!" He handed Kuno a videotape and walked off calmly.<p>Nabiki watched the scene silently from a few yards away. She had a<br/>small frown on her face as he conducted his business and left the boy<br/>sitting on the ground. "This is cutting into my own business," she<br/>snorted angrily. "I've got to do something about this."<p>Ranma went on obliviously about his day, not caring or seeming to<br/>notice any of the angry looks the male student body was giving him. He<br/>heard the hateful whispers behind his back of course, and knew that<br/>they were all too cowardly and weak to hurt him. It was starting to<br/>bug him though.<p>And thus, things went as such for several days.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Ranma, do you want to make out?"<p>Ranma blinked and looked up from the manga he had been reading in<br/>mild surprise. He turned his head and saw Nabiki sitting beside him.<br/>She was staring at the television with a bored expression on her face.<p>"Wha?" said the boy dumbly.<p>"Everyone's gone, and I'm bored," said Nabiki casually.<p>"Okay," said the boy with a shrug. "But what's the catch?"<p>"What? I'm just bored," said Nabiki as she turned towards him and<br/>shrugged her shoulders.<p>"There's always a catch," said Ranma as he glared at her in angry<br/>disbelief for a moment. "Especially with you."<p>"Look, I don't want to marry you, and it's obvious that you've<br/>already seen me naked. You took those pictures of me in the bath. So<br/>why not? I'm just bored."<p>Ranma blinked again and stood up. "Sure, whatever."<p>Nabiki pulled him down next to her, and wrapped her arms around<br/>his neck.<p>++++++++++++<p>An hour later...<p>Ranma Saotome, sat on the back porch of the Tendo home once again.<br/>He was looking rather indifferent, and scratching the inside of his<br/>ear with his pinky lazily. Inside his head was quite active though.<p>"Man, I haven't done that in years," said Dan cheerfully.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"Yeah, sure brings back memories," agreed Carrot.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"I wonder what she's up to though?" ventured Carrot lazily as he<br/>lay them back against the floor.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"I dunno, gotta be somethin," said Dan with a sagely looking nod.<br/>"She probably got pictures or something."<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"Hmmm, could be, that would be dangerous for her though," said<br/>Carrot calmly. "It's got to be something else."<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>"Well, we'll figure it out soon enough," said Dan with a small<br/>sigh.<p>"..." said Ranma.<p>++++++++++<p>Meanwhile, Nabiki Tendo sat on her bed. A small smirk on her lips<br/>as she looked at the roll of film in her palm for a moment. It had<br/>definitely been more fun than she had anticipated. Not just because<br/>she'd finally gotten her claws into him, but also because the boy had<br/>experience. It was painfully obvious he knew what he was doing. It<br/>gave her a warm and fuzzy sensation just thinking about what he'd done<br/>to her, just with his hands.<p>She idly rubbed the dark mark that was now present on her shoulder<br/>as she thought about it more and more. The boy was almost too<br/>experienced, it didn't sit well with her. It was more than being<br/>familiar with a female body, like say his curse would do to him. He<br/>knew exactly what he was doing, she was expecting to have to coax him<br/>a bit, move him around and such. Instead, she found herself sitting<br/>back and enjoying the ride.<p>She pulled the film up in front of her face for a moment too look<br/>at it and frowned deeply. "Who are you?"<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Boy! We've got to talk," said Genma as he sat across from his son<br/>at the table.<p>"Huh? Oh, hey pop," said Ranma as he turned to look at his father.<p>"I need to speak with my son, not you," said Genma coldly as he<br/>noticed the gleam in the boy's eye.<p>"Ranma's kind of out of it right now. He hasn't talked in like two<br/>hours," said the boy calmly with a shrug. "We haven't been able to<br/>snap him out of it yet."<p>"Why?" said Genma.<p>"That's none of your business, its private guy stuff," said the<br/>boy with a smirk.<p>"This is serious," snorted Genma as he glared at the boy.<p>"Genma, do you really think we're stupid enough to get Ranma<br/>killed?" said the boy calmly as he eyed the man with a harsh looking<br/>smile.<p>"I'm not sure," said the man honestly.<p>"Point taken," admitted the boy with a small nod. "However, I<br/>assure you that you and your son are quite safe from Nodoka. She<br/>thinks the curse is a separate entity. I suggest you keep up this<br/>illusion, a new personality of your own perhaps?"<p>"What?" said Genma as his eyes went wide. He wasn't sure what to<br/>say.<p>"We lied to your wife. She thinks that Ranma's girl side is<br/>someone he saved from a cursed spring. Quite a manly act to suffer for<br/>her sake," said the boy with an odd looking smirk. "She's still quite<br/>angry with you, seeing as how you ducked away from her out of fear of<br/>the seppuku pledge. That'll pass with time."<p>"Why are you telling me this?" asked Genma as he narrowed his eyes<br/>at the boy.<p>"Because Nodoka is coming here tomorrow, and I think you've sweat<br/>enough for now," said the boy with a small chuckle.<p>"About that Kuonji girl," said Genma.<p>"You don't have the right or the authority to engage all three of<br/>us to anyone," said Carrot firmly. "We'll decide who we marry, without<br/>your help."<p>"Boy! I'm..."<p>"You're not my father, you're Ranma's father. I am not Ranma<br/>Saotome, to put it bluntly, he's been outvoted. We're a collective<br/>group, Genma, we have our own way of doing things. Most of us don't<br/>care about your family's honor, or your stupid customs."<p>"What? Boy! You should learn to respect your elders!" snapped<br/>Genma as he stood up and slammed his palms on the table. He leaned in,<br/>glaring the boy directly in his eyes.<p>He simply returned the stare calmly, not intimidated in the least<br/>by the overweight man glaring at him. "You're only older than I am by<br/>about ten years old man."<p>Genma sat down, staring at the man dumbly. "What?"<p>"One of us is twenty-two, and the other twenty-eight. We don't<br/>like you Genma, but you're convenient for the moment. The instant I<br/>think you're a danger to us, I'll get rid of you without a second<br/>thought. Ranma is the only thing keeping us from eliminating you."<p>"Eliminating?" said Genma with a frown. "Boy, you need to learn<br/>your own limits!" He puffed out his chest as he said this, daring the<br/>boy to take him on.<p>"You need to learn to extend your memory a bit," said the boy<br/>coldly.<p>Genma Saotome froze as a familiar click sounded from underneath<br/>the table. He looked down and saw Ranma still sitting calmly, with<br/>both hands under the table. "What?"<p>"Calm down and behave yourself. Ranma still cares about you, and I<br/>don't want to upset him," said the boy with a small chuckle.<p>Genma did so, but continued to glare angrily at the boy across<br/>from him.<p>"Good boy," said the boy calmly.<p>Genma relaxed somewhat as the familiar click sounded again, and<br/>his son's body put both hands back on the table.<p>"What are you up to demon?" snarled Genma coldly.<p>"Me? Nothing much, I just wanted to let you know where we stood.<br/>You can continue on your way, blissfully trying to snare your son in<br/>Akane Tendo's subtle web of feminine wiles if you like. But we aren't<br/>marrying her, we don't like her much I'm afraid."<p>"What's wrong with her?" snarled Genma bitterly.<p>"She's an insanely jealous and overly violent thug, that's what."<p>Genma growled and turned his head away. "She seems nice enough to<br/>me."<p>"That's because we leave her alone," said Ranma with a small<br/>smirk. "Now, where were we? Oh yes, Nodoka will be here tomorrow<br/>afternoon. I suggest you stay home for it. She's been calmed down<br/>considerably, and shouldn't do anything rash. Well, not to me anyway."<p>Genma swallowed and rubbed at his throat absently as the boy stood<br/>up and walked away.<p>"Genma," said the boy calmly.<p>"What do you want?" snarled the man.<p>"We aren't marrying Kuonji either, just so you know. We've got<br/>much bigger plans."<p>"Care to share them with me?" said the man sarcastically.<p>"Not yet," said the boy with a chuckle as he walked up the stairs.<p>++++++++++++<p>"What just happened?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"You're finally awake?" said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"Damn, it's about time," said Dan.<p>"Auuugggh! You idiots got Nabiki pregnant!" cried Ranma in terror.<p>Dan and Carrot burst into laughter.<p>"What the hell is so damn funny!" snapped Ranma bitterly.<p>"You dolt! It takes more than a little necking and groping to get<br/>someone pregnant!" said Dan as he continued to laugh.<p>"Ranma, he's right. Relax would you?" said Carrot.<p>"Where the heck are we?" muttered Ranma as he looked around and<br/>noticed they were standing on the roof of a home somewhere in Nerima.<br/>They were dressed in the black coat and hat they had obtained the<br/>other day at the incident with Sailor Venus.<p>"We thought we'd go check out that arcade. We're gonna start<br/>hanging around in places where we can get information."<p>"Why?" snorted Ranma irritably. "I don't like no stupid games."<p>"God, don't be such an ass Ranma. It'll be fun, and people are<br/>more likely to tell you things if they know you," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully. "We need money anyway, we're goin to a bar or two while<br/>we're at it."<p>"What? Kuno isn't enough, and we've got to pick a street fight<br/>now?" said Ranma.<p>"You got that right, we're gonna need to get in contact with a<br/>local Yakuza," said Dan.<p>"What on earth for?" said Ranma as his disgust became very clear.<p>"Ammo, and re-supply," said Dan casually.<p>"We ain't even shot that thing yet!" snorted Ranma angrily.<p>"We're about too, check your six," said Dan as he began to grin.<p>Ranma turned his head and his face fell. "Oh shit."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"I knew it! It is him!" said Minako as she followed close behind<br/>the dark figure jumping through the rooftops of Nerima. The boy turned<br/>his head and saw her. "Damn! I've been spotted!"<p>"So, go after him! He can't get away!" said Artemis from the other<br/>end of the communications watch that she wore. She saw him duck into<br/>an alleyway near a large warehouse.<p>+++++++++<p>Ranma jumped down and landed in the center of a dirty looking<br/>alley. Garbage lined the walls, and steam rose from a grate in the<br/>ground that led to a storm drain. He glanced around quickly and saw a<br/>door that was chained shut. It led to the inside of a large warehouse.<br/>He turned and saw Minako land just behind him. Without thinking, he<br/>rammed into the door with his shoulder and ducked away to the inside.<p>"Got him!" cried Minako as she followed him inside. She paused and<br/>stared at her surroundings for a moment. The inside was huge, large<br/>stacks of wooden boxes rose up to two hundred feet in the air, and the<br/>whole thing was almost pitch black. "Shit."<p>"What is it?" said Artemis in alarm.<p>"This place is huge, dark, and spooky, that's what. Our man is<br/>wearing black too," she slowly walked into the room and glanced around<br/>nervously. She never even noticed the shadow rush by behind her,<br/>closing the door quietly.<p>She walked around aimlessly for a moment, shuddering at the chill<br/>in the air, and the familiar squeak of the various rodents that made<br/>the building a home. Finally she came to what appeared to be the<br/>center of the building. From there, two complex mazes of boxes<br/>stretched off to the other side of the building, one on each side of<br/>her.<p>"Hello," said a voice from above her.<p>She almost screamed in fear as she looked up and saw him sitting<br/>on the boxes just over her head.<p>"Calm down," he said as he watched her like a hawk from his perch.<br/>"I'm not going to attack you."<p>"You're not?" said the girl nervously.<p>"No. Why are you after me?" he said calmly as he looked down at<br/>her.<p>"You're one of the enemy," she said firmly as her backbone began<br/>to grow a bit more.<p>"Am I? Who is the enemy? What do they want?" said the boy in an<br/>amused tone.<p>"I...don't know," admitted Minako quietly.<p>"Really? So, you're sure I'm one of them?" said the boy<br/>cheerfully. He leaned in to stare down at her, resting his arm across<br/>his knee as he did so.<p>Minako froze as she saw the flash of silver in his hand. The boy<br/>was carrying a gun, her eyes froze on the weapon and she stepped back,<br/>all her built up courage vanished in an instant.<p>"If I wanted to use this, you never would have even heard the<br/>shot," said Ranma calmly. "We're going to sit her and talk, and you're<br/>going to tell me exactly why you want to kill me. I believe I deserve<br/>an explanation at the very least."<p>"Because you are the most violent and chaotic creature on the<br/>entire planet!" said a familiar voice. "Dead Scream!"<p>Minako stared in shock as the boxes where the boy had been<br/>standing shattered into a thousand pieces, showering the room in<br/>debris.<p>"Don't worry about the gun, your Senshi powers will protect you<br/>from the bullets," said the woman who walked up behind Minako. She<br/>smirked at her and brushed a hand through her long green hair idly.<br/>"He doesn't stand a chance against us."<p>"Who are you?" said Minako in shock as she stepped away from the<br/>newcomer.<p>"I am the Senshi of Pluto," said the woman calmly. "I'm afraid you<br/>won't see much of me in the future, but this is too important for me<br/>to leave to you alone."<p>"That's good to know, Pluto. I don't have to worry about<br/>accidentally killing you then do I?" said Ranma from the shadows just<br/>behind them.<p>"What?" gasped Setsuna as she whirled around. Minako was thrown<br/>off her feet and landed roughly on the ground, sprawled out painfully.<br/>The Senshi of Pluto noticed a flash of light that was followed by a<br/>loud bang. "No! Venus! Are you all right?"<p>"Ouch," muttered the blonde as she stood up slowly. She was<br/>rubbing a spot on her shoulder and looking at it in a sort of shocked<br/>wonder. "That hurt!"<p>"Seems you weren't lying. I wonder if you could take a shot from<br/>this distance though?" Ranma melted from the shadows, directly beside<br/>Pluto as he touched her temple with the barrel of the gun. There was<br/>another in his other hand, trained on Minako. Both weapons were silver<br/>plated 45. semi automatic handguns.<p>"Try it and find out," snarled Pluto bitterly. "I should have<br/>known you'd join Beryl to save your worthless hide Genaku."<p>"Join Beryl? Don't be stupid," said the boy calmly. He spun the<br/>gun around in his hand and brought the butt down against her temple,<br/>sending her to the ground out cold.<p>"No!" screamed Minako in horror as she started forward.<p>Ranma pointed both barrels at her and stopped her cold. She stood<br/>glaring at him angrily for a moment. "She's fine, I'm not going to<br/>kill you."<p>"Too bad!" snarled Venus as she thrust her hands forward, blasting<br/>a wave of light energy at him. Ranma ducked and rolled away, barely<br/>avoiding the blast as he vanished into the shadows once again.<p>Minako rushed up to Pluto's side, lifting her up into her arms for<br/>a moment. "Are you all right?"<p>The Senshi of Time woke up and fluttered her eyes for a moment.<br/>"Yes." She slowly stood up and glanced around the room cautiously.<br/>"Where is he?"<p>"I don't know, he vanished again," said Minako nervously as she<br/>glanced around.<p>Pluto narrowed her eyes and stared into the darkness. "We have to<br/>find him and destroy him. He's dangerous."<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma was standing with his back against a metal support beam,<br/>looking into the darkness. "Shit! What the hell did you two assholes<br/>get us into?"<p>"Shut up! This isn't going very well, Carrot," said Dan tensely.<p>"No shit, We've gotta get out of here," said the boy in<br/>frustration. "I can't believe Pluto is trying to kill us!"<p>"Scratch one fiancee," said Dan morbidly as he slowed their<br/>breathing down a bit.<p>"Right, next thing is getting out of here alive," said Carrot as<br/>he nodded in agreement. "Where's the door?"<p>"Other side of the room," said Dan as he turned their head towards<br/>the exit. "That way."<p>"Shit, they're standing between us and the exit," said Carrot.<p>"We could go over them," said Ranma as he looked up at the stacks<br/>of boxes.<p>"That'd cut down the amount of room we have to maneuver in,"<br/>warned Carrot as he saw what the boy was planning.<p>"It's our best chance to escape unnoticed though," said Dan as he<br/>put the two weapons into the holsters that hung at the small of their<br/>back.<p>"Right, come on. Quietly," said Ranma as he stepped forward and<br/>jumped into the air.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Pluto scanned the area cautiously, with Minako at her back at the<br/>ready. "Where is he?"<p>Venus was shaking, completely terrified. Setsuna realized that the<br/>situation they found themselves in wasn't good. Ranma shouldn't have<br/>much that could really hurt them in his arsenal though. "Relax, we're<br/>not vulnerable. The Power of your transformation will stop most life<br/>threatening injuries. A bullet won't do much to hurt us, unless it's<br/>magically charged."<p>"Can he do that?" muttered Minako nervously.<p>"I don't think so," lied Pluto. "That doesn't mean it doesn't hurt<br/>though, don't get shot."<p>"Right, I remember," muttered Minako with a slightly more<br/>confident tone.<p>Pluto froze and whirled around on her heels. "Up there! Dead<br/>Scream!"<p>"Venus Crescent Beam!"<p>"Shit," muttered the shadow as it turned to look down at them,<br/>just before the boxes under his feet exploded, sending him flying into<br/>the air. Ranma put his arms up and rolled as he arced towards the<br/>ground and hit the floor rolling.<p>He stood up and rushed away as another pair of magical attacks<br/>slammed into the area where he had landed. The blast caught him and he<br/>was lifted into the air and pushed away from the center of<br/>destruction. A large hole was now present in the wall of the building,<br/>and dust filled the entire room.<p>Ranma was growling angrily as he stood with his back against<br/>another set of boxes, just out of the senshi's line of sight. "That<br/>does it."<p>"Come out and give up. I promise I'll make it quick," said Setsuna<br/>with a confident smirk on her face.<p>"Come on Setsuna, you're so cute when you're angry. You may have<br/>tossed me around a bit, but I'm not hurt."<p>"Still an Asshole," growled the Senshi of Time under her breath.<p>++++++++++++<p>Dan put a pair of shades on his face and grinned, it was not a<br/>nice smile. Carrot and Ranma both looked around in surprise as techno<br/>music began to play inside their head.<p>"What the?" muttered Ranma nervously.<p>"Um, Dan? What are you doing?" said Carrot with an equal amount of<br/>uncertainty.<p>"Getting us the hell out of here," said the boy as he stepped<br/>around the corner and pulled the two weapons from behind his back<br/>again.<p>"How many times have you seen 'The Matrix' anyway?" grumbled<br/>Carrot irritably as everything began to make sense.<p>"I owned it," replied Dan with his smirk widening.<p>"What the hell are you guys talkin about?" muttered Ranma in<br/>confusion.<p>++++++++++++<p>"There he is!" snarled Setsuna as she saw his figure through the<br/>cloud of dust. He was simply standing with his hands out at his sides,<br/>holding the handguns at the ready.<p>"Right!" agreed Minako as she narrowed her eyes.<p>Dan moved silently and quickly, charging directly for them. He<br/>raised his hands, and began to fire the guns. Both Senshi were thrown<br/>back as the bullets slammed into their chests. He continued to run by,<br/>kicking off a few boxes to sail over their heads as he moved towards<br/>the door again.<p>"We could have just taken that hole you know," said Ranma<br/>irritably.<p>"Not without giving them payback!" snarled Dan inside his head as<br/>they continued to run towards the door, all while firing the gun's<br/>behind them to keep the Senshi at bay.<p>Setsuna was on her feet the instant he was over their heads. She<br/>spun around dodging a few more bullets. "Dead Scream!" she cried as<br/>she blasted another hole in the wall, barely missing Ranma as he<br/>ducked aside and was thrown into another group of boxes by the shock<br/>wave of the blast.<p>Minako slowly picked up her head and watched as a small object<br/>fell out of the boy's hand and rolled over to several large drums that<br/>were covered by a tarp.<p>Ranma rolled over and blinked painfully. He was glancing around in<br/>a slight daze for a moment. All the while, Setsuna was preparing<br/>another blast.<p>"I have you!" she cried triumphantly.<p>The boy was looking at his hand at the time rather blankly. He<br/>took off the sunglasses and stared at her in horror. Setsuna smiled,<br/>until she realized that he wasn't looking at her at all, but just<br/>behind her.<p>"No!" screamed the woman as she turned her head and saw the red<br/>labels on the barrels, and the small grenade that rested just beside<br/>them. The next moment was nothing more than a burning pain that<br/>swallowed her up completely.<p>Minako shrieked in terror as the wall of fire rushed up to her,<br/>she managed to stand up and started to run desperately away, explosion<br/>after explosion sounded behind her and she stumbled as the ground<br/>shook beneath her. The last thing she remembered was the wall of fire<br/>rushing up her legs.<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma was having problems of his own, he had landed near the<br/>doorway, and ran outside as the flames rushed up to him. The instant<br/>he was out the door, he rolled away as a jet of fire blasted out after<br/>him. He staggered to his feet as the flames quickly consumed the<br/>alley, jumping up to avoid the blast and rushing out into the street.<br/>He continued to run away, moving across the street as the building<br/>burned. He turned once he reached the other side and stared in horror<br/>at the destruction.<p>The warehouse exploded, sending flaming shrapnel in every<br/>direction. The boom sent a shock wave out that shattered windows for<br/>blocks. He shielded his face and staggered back from the force, his<br/>ears ringing as the boom died down. Finally, he stepped back and<br/>dusted himself off as the building now burned silently, sending a<br/>shower of fiery debris raining down on the street.<p>"Whoa! That was cool!" exclaimed Dan.<p>"Let's get out of here!" said Carrot as he turned and jumped onto<br/>a nearby rooftop. "We'd best not be around when the emergency vehicles<br/>show up." The sirens were already audible in the distance.<p>"Wow," said Ranma dumbly as he took another glance back at the<br/>burning remains of their battlefield.<p>"Oh my god! We killed Pluto!" said Carrot as he stared with Ranma.<p>"So much for that engagement," commented Dan.<p>"Right," muttered Ranma, he hadn't been able to say much else thus<br/>far. He felt an overwhelming sense of dread fill him, as if something<br/>had been torn out of his heart. "What have I done?" he gasped.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Inside the warehouse, a pile of debris slowly rose from the floor.<br/>Two cold blue eyes became visible as the pile of hot ash burned across<br/>her body. Tears streamed down her face, her uniform was charred and<br/>burnt to shreds. Her hair was actually burning in some places, and<br/>several cuts were visible where her skin was visible. She was covered<br/>in a thick layer of ash and shuddered for a moment as she looked<br/>around. She raised her hands into the air and screamed painfully.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"What is it?" said Dr. Who as he looked at the odd contraption he<br/>had been handed. He was standing inside a cave of some kind, on what<br/>was clearly some distant planet in another dimension.<p>"A molecular disrupter," said the small old man who stood in front<br/>of him. He was bald, and appeared to have been painted purple. He wore<br/>a long robe, made from a green sparkly fabric. "That fiend spent time<br/>on the surface of Jupiter, you won't be able to harm him with anything<br/>less."<p>"It seems like a bit much," said the Dr. coldly as he accepted the<br/>strange contraption. It looked like an oversized blaster, and it was<br/>blowing bubbles out of a large tube that protruded from the top.<p>"Quickly! He's coming!" said a beautiful looking female companion<br/>who cowered in terror.<p>Dr. Who got a stern look on his face as he walked towards the<br/>tunnel that led into the room. He readied the blaster and waited.<p>"Mr. Where!" said an odd looking mushroom man in terror. His body<br/>looked oddly like it was made out of rubber.<p>"Who!" roared a voice from down the cavern. "Because of you! I<br/>really have seen hell!"<p>"You're the one who was driving when we went there!" retorted the<br/>Doctor as he glared at the figure that stood opposite him now.<p>Ryoga Hibiki glared angrily at his nemesis, a small R was now<br/>present on his forehead. He pointed his umbrella at the man and<br/>smirked. "You're no match for me Who. I grow tired of these cheesy<br/>effects, everyone here sound so ridiculous!"<p>"Well, your accent sounds faked!" retorted the doctor bitterly.<p>"How dare you!" snarled Mr. Where as he stalked forward, his feet<br/>left craters in the ground as he walked, crushing the rock where he<br/>passed easily.<p>"Now!" said the purple man desperately.<p>"You never told me how it works!" snapped Dr. Who as he fumbled<br/>with the mechanism for a moment.<p>"Press the button on the side! It will scatter his molecules<br/>across the dimensions!" said the purple man.<p>"Oh no!" said the mushroom man as he hid his face away.<p>The female led swooned, and reached for Dr. Who desperately. "No!<br/>Look out!"<p>Ryoga, who was still almost ten feet away, and moving rather<br/>sluggishly, blinked and stared at her for a moment. Unfortunately, Dr.<br/>Who found the button at that moment, and a multicolored light erupted<br/>from the barrel.<p>"No! I won't be beaten by such a cheesy looking effect!" said<br/>Ryoga in horror as he slowly faded away.<p>"It's over," said Dr. Who as he tossed the machine on the ground<br/>carelessly. "I've finally defeated, Mr. Where."<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: A familiar visitor?<p>Hee hee. I'm evil.<p>
