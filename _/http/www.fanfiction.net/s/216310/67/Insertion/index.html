</div>Insertion<p>Part 67<p>Visiting Nerima<p>+++++++++++<p>It was mid afternoon in Japan, the sun was<br/>high in the air and slowly descending towards the<br/>horizon.<p>They had attempted their new technique earlier<br/>that morning and had kept it up for about four<br/>hours. They stayed in the home and things were<br/>relatively quiet, other than a small scuffle about<br/>what to watch on television that is.<p>Now, Carrot stood in the street staring at Dan<br/>and Xianfu just after they finished their<br/>separation. "Well, we should get going. I'd say<br/>we've got anywhere from three to four hours before<br/>this breaks down on us."<p>"Right, stay out of trouble," said Dan with a<br/>snort as he turned away and started walking.<p>"I suppose I'll see you when you get back<br/>then," said Xianfu as she turned away.<p>Ranma growled at her, but didn't say anything.<br/>Carrot turned them around and started walking.<br/>"Easy there buddy, we've got other concerns<br/>today."<p>They were all in different forms. Carrot and<br/>Ranma were in their original sixteen-year-old<br/>form, Dan was in their older adult form, and<br/>Xianfu had taken the guise of Yohiko.<p>"Right," grumbled the original owner of their<br/>body hatefully. "We'll get her later."<p>"One way or another," agreed Carrot as he<br/>strolled down the street. "So where are we going?"<p>"Well, Xianfu is moving into Nerima, who the<br/>hell knows where Dan wandered off too, so I guess<br/>we'll go this way," replied Carrot as he pointed<br/>towards their destination.<p>"I thought we weren't supposed to fight,"<br/>muttered Ranma dumbly.<p>"We should be all right," said Carrot as they<br/>started towards Nerima.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"So...ummm..." said Pissant as they stepped<br/>into a bar and sat down at a stool. "What are we<br/>doing today?"<p>Dan snorted and glanced up at the bartender.<br/>"Getting drunk."<p>"Oh, why?" asked the voice with a slightly<br/>nervous tone.<p>"Because I deserve it, and we're gonna need it<br/>to kill the pain once those idiots get together<br/>again."<p>"Oh."<p>The bartender walked over to them and smiled.<p>Dan returned the smirk. "Gimme a beer."<p>++++++++++++<p>Xianfu smiled and sighed with contentment as<br/>she walked through the streets in silence. It was<br/>a wonderful feeling to just walk, no constant<br/>babbling, no arguments, nothing. Just the sweet<br/>sound of silence.<p>After a moment she found herself in the middle<br/>of a small shopping center and sat down at a table<br/>just outside a cafe.<p>"Good morning," said the handsome waiter as he<br/>walked up to her with a notepad in his hand.<p>"Yes it is isn't it?" she replied with a<br/>smirk. The man's gaze was lustful and she crossed<br/>her legs with expert care as she noticed his gaze<br/>wandering slightly.<p>He seemed to snap out of his stupor and opened<br/>his mouth to speak.<p>She interrupted him and tossed the menu aside.<br/>"Bring me some green tea."<p>"Of course," he said nervously.<p>She watched him leave with a smirk on her<br/>face, eyeing his rear as he walked away. With a<br/>heavy sigh she turned away and frowned. "I suppose<br/>I can behave myself for today."<p>++++++++++<p>"Aiya! Airen!" cried Shampoo cheerfully as she<br/>jumped towards her beloved.<p>Carrot sighed and sidestepped the glomp,<br/>barely managing to avoid it. "Damn, gotta remember<br/>we're not as strong of as fast this way."<p>The young Amazon girl was undaunted as she<br/>turned to face them again. "You come to see<br/>Shampoo?"<p>"Not really no, but you're here," replied the<br/>young looking pigtailed boy somewhat pleasantly.<br/>"How ya been?"<p>"Ranma not come visit Shampoo for long time!<br/>Been almost week!" said the girl with a cute<br/>looking frown.<p>"I don't come here to visit you Shampoo, I'm<br/>just checking up on things in general," replied<br/>the boy casually.<p>"Ranma being unkind to wife!" snapped the<br/>girl.<p>"You're not my wife, and I do come to see you<br/>and the ghoul while I'm here," replied the boy<br/>flatly.<p>The girl nodded and started walking along side<br/>him. "Ranma stay long time today?"<p>"Only a few hours," replied the boy calmly.<br/>"I'm working on something today."<p>"Oh?" said the girl cheerfully. "What is<br/>working on?"<p>"New technique," said Ranma calmly as he<br/>continued towards the Cat Cafe.<p>"Well, at any rate..." said the boy as he<br/>glanced around. "Where is Mousse, he should be<br/>trying to kill me by now."<p>"Mousse very busy today," said the girl<br/>cheerfully. She giggled and bounced towards the<br/>restaurant.<p>Ranma followed them inside and sat down at one<br/>of the tables. Cologne bounced over to him and<br/>stopped cold.<p>"Son in law?"<p>Ranma blinked at this and stared at her.<br/>"Huh?"<p>"You have returned from China? Are you<br/>visiting, or has something happened between<br/>yourself and the Musk Prince?" said the old woman<br/>as she sat down beside him. "It was unwise for you<br/>to return here. The others are not pleased with<br/>you."<p>"What the heck are you talkin about you old<br/>bat?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"Don't try to fool me boy, I can read your<br/>aura," said the old woman as she eyed him<br/>playfully.<p>"Actually, I'm not sure what you mean..." the<br/>boy's voice trailed off as a realization came over<br/>him. "Oh. That."<p>Cologne arched her eyebrow and remained<br/>silent.<p>"You've got the wrong Ranma," said the boy<br/>with a chuckle. "I'm working on a new technique,<br/>so my aura is different than usual."<p>"A technique that changes your aura?" said the<br/>woman doubtfully. "It must be a very powerful<br/>technique, your ki is much lower than..."<p>"I'm down by a two thirds," said the boy with<br/>a shrug.<p>"Oh?" said the woman as she relaxed a little.<p>"I suppose there's no harm in telling you," he<br/>said calmly. "It's called the Multiform Technique.<br/>There's three of me running around town today."<p>Cologne almost fell out of her chair. "What?"<p>"I managed to split myself into three separate<br/>bodies," said the boy calmly.<p>"That isn't possible," said Cologne<br/>doubtfully.<p>"Really? It wasn't very difficult," said the<br/>boy with a shrug.<p>Cologne found herself chuckling despite<br/>herself. "Ah, if it were anyone else, I wouldn't<br/>believe it. I can see now that your aura is<br/>slightly different now. That could have been done<br/>since the boy left for China all those months<br/>ago."<p>"Naw, it's just me," replied the boy<br/>cheerfully.<p>"If there are three of you, then perhaps we<br/>can work something out with my Shampoo..." started<br/>the woman as she set tea out for him and herself.<p>"Ha! Always manipulating?" he said cheerfully.<br/>"Well, I still wouldn't do it, but I'm afraid it<br/>wouldn't work out even if I did."<p>"Oh?" asked the old woman as she frowned<br/>slightly.<p>"The technique only lasts about three or four<br/>hours, and we aren't sure if there's some sort of<br/>range effect or not," replied Ranma as he chuckled<br/>slightly.<p>"Most interesting, the weakness?" asked the<br/>woman as she eyed him carefully.<p>"It's a side effect. Each of us is weaker than<br/>the original by how many copies we make of<br/>ourselves. Three is the most I can do at the<br/>moment."<p>"Ah, I see," replied the woman as she nodded.<br/>"So tell me, what brings you to Nerima? Shouldn't<br/>you be working?"<p>"Took the day off to test out the technique.<br/>There's still some things I'm not sure of," he<br/>replied with a shrug.<p>"Oh?" she prodded.<p>"Well, the exact amount of time I can do it<br/>for one, the range, we're trying that out now, and<br/>how many times I can do it in one day."<p>"I see," said the crone with a short nod. "You<br/>will be staying around today?"<p>"For a few hours, until this wears off<br/>anyway," said the boy with a small shrug. "You<br/>still haven't told Shampoo? I'm getting tired of<br/>playing Airen for her."<p>"She isn't ready. I've tried to keep her<br/>distanced from you, keeping her too busy to go<br/>looking for you in Juban. I do appreciate what<br/>you're doing."<p>"Well, I suppose it's not hurting anything,"<br/>replied Ranma with another shrug. "Still, you need<br/>to work this out."<p>Cologne sighed and nodded. "Believe me, I<br/>understand."<p>"I'm surprised she hasn't found out on her own<br/>though. Kuonji isn't happy with Saotome, and those<br/>Tendo girls probably would have told her by now<br/>I'd think."<p>"It was easy enough to buy silence from them,"<br/>replied Cologne with a small smirk. "Kuonji was<br/>the simplest, keeping her revenge private was all<br/>I needed. Nabiki Tendo, she requires nothing more<br/>than a small donation. Akane has never liked<br/>Shampoo, but seems to respect her enough to keep<br/>silent at my request. The two idiots, they need<br/>only the knowledge that their plans for reunion<br/>are exclusive to Akane Tendo. The Kuno family does<br/>not speak with Shampoo, she tends to avoid them.<br/>Mousse is an idiot, and he doesn't know thanks to<br/>you. As for the Hibiki boy, his little habit of<br/>making his bed with the Tendo girl..."<p>"I think I get the picture. These fools are<br/>too easy to manipulate, they all have glaring<br/>weaknesses."<p>"You are correct," agreed Cologne.<p>"Is he still on about that Shinnosuke boy?"<br/>asked Ranma with a slight chuckle.<p>"Yes, it maddens him to no end," commented<br/>Cologne merrily. "Young Akane has been keeping in<br/>regular contact with him through letters, she<br/>plans to visit soon. I do not think she will<br/>return from that valley when she does go."<p>Ranma nodded and smirked. "Hibiki's still<br/>losing, despite everything?"<p>"He doesn't seem to understand it," said the<br/>woman. "With Ranma out of the picture, he thought<br/>his love was secure. Poor creature."<p>"Poor creature indeed, you can't imagine my<br/>surprise when I heard him bellowing 'Shinnosuke!<br/>This is all your fault!' Heh."<p>"I have been getting a strange feeling<br/>Saotome, that you had something to do with that?"<br/>asked Cologne as her eyes twinkled in amusement.<p>"Who? Me?" replied the boy with a knowing grin<br/>on his face. "What makes you say that?"<p>"What indeed?" she said as she turned her head<br/>away from him.<p>"It wasn't too much of a problem really, I<br/>just had to fight a dragon, save his worthless<br/>behind, and tattoo 'write Akane a letter today' on<br/>the back of his hand." He sighed and hung his<br/>head. "I just wish I'd done it as a man. I think<br/>Akane still has a crush on her teacher."<p>"Yes, she is a very confused young woman,"<br/>said the hag in amusement.<p>"Irritatingly so," agreed Ranma flatly.<p>"So what are your plans for the rest of the<br/>day?" asked Cologne as she stood up.<p>"I was planning on wandering around town a<br/>little. I'm really just waiting for my time to be<br/>up."<p>"I see, well, good luck then," said the old<br/>woman as she smiled at him and hopped away.<p>"Yeah, thanks," muttered Ranma as he stood up<br/>and headed for the door.<p>Shampoo appeared out of the kitchen. "Airen,<br/>you is leaving?"<p>"Yeah. Afraid so, I got some stuff to do<br/>today," he replied as he glanced back at her.<p>"Shampoo come too then!" squealed the girl.<p>"Sorry Shampoo, I'm just visiting a few<br/>people, I'll stop by again if I have time later,<br/>but no promises."<p>The girl frowned and pouted. "Ranma not being<br/>very good husband."<p>"Whatever, It's personal business Shampoo.<br/>Don't worry so much," he said with a small sigh as<br/>he walked out of the building.<p>++++++++++<p>Carrot and Ranma found themselves standing<br/>outside the Ucchan a short time later.<p>"I'm hungry," said Ranma as he looked up at<br/>the store sign.<p>"Well, if you are I am," replied Carrot as he<br/>shrugged and walked into the front door.<p>"You! How dare you show your face here! Die!"<br/>screamed Ukyo.<p>"You know, this was kinda funny the first ten<br/>times it happened Ukyo," said the pigtailed boy<br/>who found himself standing in the act of dodging<br/>several small spatulas that were now stuck in the<br/>wall.<p>The girl behind the counter blushed and<br/>relaxed suddenly. "Oh, it's you."<p>"Yeah, me," said the boy a little sourly.<br/>"I'll have the usual."<p>Ukyo nodded and began to prepare his meal<br/>silently.<p>"How are things?" asked Ranma as he leaned<br/>against the counter.<p>"Well enough, you haven't been by in a while,"<br/>said the girl with a somewhat cheerful expression<br/>on her face. It didn't look forced in the<br/>slightest.<p>"Yeah, I've been busy. My daughter's falling<br/>behind in her schoolwork, and my brother is still<br/>living with me. That useless leech."<p>"Must run in the family," commented the girl<br/>as she put the boy's plate in front of him.<p>"Something like that, I think that gene<br/>skipped me or something," he said flatly.<p>"Whatever," muttered the girl irritably.<p>"Hey, stop comparing me to him. It's annoying<br/>enough as it is," said the boy as he narrowed his<br/>eyes at her.<p>Ukyo blinked and turned to look at him.<br/>"Brother?"<p>"Yeah, I've got a brother," replied Ranma<br/>calmly as he ate.<p>"Ranma doesn't have a brother," said the girl<br/>in disbelief.<p>"And I'm not Ranma," replied the pigtailed boy<br/>as he smirked at her.<p>"Who is a useless leech?" said a familiar<br/>voice from behind Ranma. He found himself face<br/>down on the counter with a wooden staff in the<br/>back of his head.<p>"Who the heck are you?" muttered Ukyo as she<br/>stared at the newcomer.<p>"I am Xellos," replied the man cheerfully.<br/>"I'm this fools brother. He doesn't appreciate me<br/>though, obviously." He pulled up a chair and sat<br/>down next to Ranma.<p>"What the hell are you doing here?" snorted<br/>the pigtailed boy irritably.<p>"Just checking up on you and your friends. One<br/>of them is babe watching in a shopping center, the<br/>other is getting rather drunk in a bar near our<br/>home. Neither one is my idea of an ideal day."<p>"Figures," muttered the boy flatly.<p>Ukyo froze and stared at the men for a moment.<br/>"I guess I can see it, kinda."<p>"Creepy isn't it?" asked Xellos.<p>"Everyone keeps saying that, but we don't look<br/>anything alike," grumbled Ranma irritably.<p>"I guess it's that willing personality we seem<br/>to have," said Xellos cheerfully.<p>"Right," muttered Ukyo.<p>"In any case, I should probably drop by to see<br/>the Tendo family," said the pigtailed boy with a<br/>heavy sigh.<p>"So they can try to force you into marriage?"<p>Ranma glared at Xellos and sighed. "They<br/>aren't that bad."<p>"Whatever," muttered Ukyo as she looked away<br/>from the pair.<p>"So how goes the quest for my dear other<br/>self?" said Ranma as he cheered up suddenly.<p>"I've almost got enough saved up," grumbled<br/>Ukyo. "I'll get that bastard yet."<p>"Well, you do that," said the pigtailed boy as<br/>he stood up and started towards the door.<p>"See you around," said Ukyo as he exited.<p>He gave her an acknowledging wave over his<br/>shoulder and continued on his way without a word.<p>"Aren't you going?" asked Ukyo as she noticed<br/>that Xellos had not moved.<p>"So those two idiots can try to marry me off?<br/>No thanks, I'd rather they never found out that<br/>he's got a brother."<p>Ukyo shook her head and chuckled despite<br/>herself. "Well, what can I get you then?"<p>++++++++++++<p>"Boy!"<p>"Son!"<p>"Oh my!"<p>"Great."<p>"You! Die!"<p>The Tendo family, plus one Saotome, greeted<br/>him in their usual fashion.<p>Ranma ducked under the attacking Akane and<br/>sent her sprawling across the floor with an<br/>extended leg. He smiled at Kasumi, and jumped over<br/>Genma and Soun, only to land in front of Nabiki.<p>"You know, I almost think you scripted this<br/>stuff," muttered the girl as she smirked at him.<p>"Seems that way at times, I wish they'd stop<br/>this. It's annoying."<p>Ranma turned to face Genma and Soun. "Hiya old<br/>guys."<p>"Boy! It's time you lived up to your<br/>responsibility!" cried Genma.<p>"Yes, my poor Akane is so upset!" agreed Soun.<p>Ranma looked over to where the youngest was<br/>standing and smiled at her. "Hey Akane, how's<br/>Shinnosuke doin?"<p>The girl blinked in surprise and suddenly<br/>blushed heavily. "How would I know?"<p>"I dunno, he's been writing you right?" said<br/>the boy as he looked at her in mock confusion.<p>"Oh yes!" said Kasumi cheerfully. "In fact,<br/>she received a letter from her little friend only<br/>yesterday!"<p>"Good," said Ranma cheerfully. "I imagine not<br/>much has changed in that little part of Japan."<p>"Not really," grumbled Akane as she turned<br/>away in embarrassment.<p>"Good," said the boy as he sat down on the<br/>floor in front of Soun and Genma. "So how's it<br/>hangin old guys?"<p>"Boy, your family needs you!" snapped Genma as<br/>he stood tall in front of him and tried his best<br/>to be intimidating.<p>"This again?" grumbled the boy as he frowned<br/>suddenly. "Man, don't you two ever give up? You'd<br/>think me or Akane had some sort of inheritance or<br/>something the way you've been going at this."<p>Both men fell silent and looked at one<br/>another.<p>"Of course not boy! What would make you think<br/>that?" snapped Genma.<p>"Because I had one, my evil clone killed you<br/>after you tried to steal it from him. Too bad, he<br/>rather liked you from what I understand."<p>The men looked at one another for a moment and<br/>fell silent again.<p>"Did you say evil clone?" asked Nabiki in<br/>shock.<p>"Yeah, he was a real asshole. We killed him<br/>eventually, but he caused all sorts of trouble,"<br/>said the boy lazily as he picked at his ear.<p>"Um. Ranma doesn't really have an evil clone<br/>does he?" asked Akane nervously.<p>"Huh? I don't think this one does. Well, he<br/>could, but only if his mother turned into a<br/>megalomanaical witch over the past ten years or<br/>so. He killed her too as I understand it. I don't<br/>know all the details, I was busy being dead for<br/>most of that time."<p>"Dead?" muttered Kasumi.<p>"Yeah, it kinda sucked. I was in hell, then I<br/>went to heaven. It's a long and involved story<br/>that I really don't like getting into unless I<br/>have too."<p>Kasumi blinked and looked at her sisters<br/>before sitting down in front of him. "Did you get<br/>to meet Kamisama?"<p>"Huh? Well, yeah. I was dead after all. I met<br/>Hild too, she wasn't all that bad really," replied<br/>the boy.<p>"You have got to be kidding me," muttered<br/>Nabiki.<p>"So skeptical? Even after everything you've<br/>seen over the past year or so?" replied the boy<br/>with an amused looking chuckle.<p>"Who's Hild?" said Akane dumbly.<p>"She's the Queen of Hell," said the boy<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Oh my!" gasped Kasumi with a scandalized<br/>looking frown.<p>"Kamisama wasn't near as impressive looking as<br/>she was really. It was kind of a let down," said<br/>Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"What was he like?" asked Kasumi hopefully.<br/>She was absolutely enthralled.<p>"Hmm? Oh, he was nice enough. He's got a<br/>really weird sense of humor. I even found out he's<br/>got a boss," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Wait a minute," said Nabiki. "Let me get this<br/>straight. Kamisama, has a boss?" The look on her<br/>face told him she didn't believe a single word of<br/>it.<p>"Yeah, L-sama. Lord of Chaos or something.<br/>It's a really big god that pretty much makes up<br/>the entire universe," said the boy cheerfully.<br/>"It's the really big one, even the demons are<br/>under that thing."<p>"Oh my! But, you said it was a god," muttered<br/>Kasumi nervously.<p>"Well, not really. It's more<br/>like...hmmm...more like an all-powerful being that<br/>controls both evil and good. It's sort of both."<p>"Ranma, you're so full of crap your eyes are<br/>turning brown," said Nabiki.<p>Outside, thunder rumbled ominously.<p>Everyone in the room became quiet.<p>"Okay, how many people in this room have been<br/>dead before?" said Ranma as he raised his hand. He<br/>looked around and saw no one else with their hand<br/>in the air. "Okay then."<p>"That doesn't sound very nice," muttered<br/>Kasumi as she fretted about it for a moment.<p>"Huh? Don't worry so much Kasumi. Kami's a<br/>great guy. You've got nothing to worry about.<br/>You'd probably like L-sama if you met it."<p>"It?" grumbled Nabiki crossly. "It's not a boy<br/>or a girl?"<p>"Actually, I think it's a little of both.<br/>Mostly male though," replied the boy with a shrug.<p>"You're just being a jerk and showing off!"<br/>snapped Akane.<p>"Why else would I come over here?" replied the<br/>boy as he looked at her as if she'd grown a second<br/>head.<p>"You..." started the girl hatefully.<p>"What? Calm down and relax. I'm just having a<br/>little fun, besides, I'm not lying."<p>"Do you really think L-sama would like me?"<br/>said Kasumi as she looked at the boy.<p>"Yeah. I'm sure of it," said Ranma cheerfully.<br/>"At any rate, those two sure have been quiet." The<br/>boy suddenly realized that Soun and Genma hadn't<br/>spoken yet, they were merely sitting in place and<br/>staring at him.<p>Finally, Genma spoke up. "That's enough of<br/>this nonsense boy!"<p>"My son in law is crazy! Waaahhhh!" cried<br/>Soun.<p>Ranma sighed and stood up. "Idiots."<p>"Show your father some respect boy!" said<br/>Genma as he charged.<p>Ranma put his palm against the man's chest and<br/>casually flipped him aside, sending him into the<br/>koi pond. "I really wish he'd stop making me do<br/>that every time I come over."<p>"So did you just come over here to bother us?"<br/>asked Nabiki.<p>"Huh? Naw. I haven't seen Happosai around<br/>lately," said the boy as he looked up at the room.<br/>"This is the third time I've been by, and I<br/>haven't seen so much as panty lying around the<br/>floor in this place.<p>"Well, he's avoiding you still," replied<br/>Nabiki.<p>"Still? Man, it's been almost a month now!"<p>"Well, you did sneak in and turn his head into<br/>a 'Chia Pet'," said Akane without much heat in her<br/>voice.<p>"And then there was that time you replaced his<br/>panty collection with used men's boxers and jock<br/>straps," pointed out Nabiki.<p>"Yeah, it was disturbingly easy to find<br/>volunteers for that one," replied the boy with a<br/>shudder.<p>"Don't forget the time he covered all his<br/>panties in itching powder," said Kasumi<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Yeah, his head was beet red for almost two<br/>weeks from all the scratching," said Akane as she<br/>seemed to be getting into the spirit of things.<p>"Well, he did keep trying to activate my<br/>curse. I just couldn't get it through his skull<br/>that water didn't work anymore." The boy shrugged<br/>and turned towards the door. "Oh well. See you<br/>around, I just dropped by while I was running a<br/>few errands in town."<p>"Yeah, see ya," muttered Nabiki as the boy<br/>walked out the door.<p>Akane sat down at the table and sighed again.<br/>She'd been in a rotten mood over the past few days<br/>or so.<p>"What is it?" asked Nabiki.<p>"Nothing. I'm starting to get worried about<br/>Miss Hibiki. She's missed two days now," said the<br/>girl with a slightly frustrated frown.<p>"I'm sure she's fine. She'll probably be in<br/>tomorrow. I heard there's some sort of little bug<br/>going around that side of town," said Nabiki as<br/>she turned away and looked in the direction Ranma<br/>had walked off in.<p>"Yeah, she's such a great teacher though. I<br/>miss her, the substitute just isn't the same,"<br/>said Akane a little too emotionally.<p>"I'm really starting to wonder..." muttered<br/>the older girl to herself as she watched her<br/>sister stare out into space for a moment.<p>"Did you say something?" asked Kasumi.<p>"Huh? No. Just thinking out loud," replied<br/>Nabiki as she walked towards her room.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Carrot walked into a park, looking for a<br/>deserted area. It didn't take long for him to find<br/>a nice quiet corner.<p>He sighed and sat down, looking up at the sky<br/>as he felt the last of the ki holding his body<br/>together fading away. "Well, that was interesting<br/>if nothing else."<p>"Wonder where we'll end up? With Dan or<br/>Xianfu?" asked Ranma.<p>"Who knows?" said Carrot with a shrug of his<br/>shoulders.<p>"It'd be nice if we did," grumbled Ranma.<p>"Well, that's how things are," replied Carrot.<p>"Yeah," agreed the boy halfheartedly.<p>"Ranma!" cried Ryoga Hibiki as he appeared in<br/>front of them. "I've found you at last! For what<br/>you've done to Akane, prepare to die!"<p>"Hiya Ryoga," said the pigtailed boy as he sat<br/>up and frowned at the lost boy.<p>"Hiya? Is that all you've got to say to me?"<br/>snarled Ryoga.<p>"I'm not Ranma," said Carrot flatly.<p>"What? How stupid do you think I am? You<br/>abandoned Akane!"<p>"You're obviously stupid enough to forget<br/>about me," said Ranma calmly as he stood up and<br/>dusted his pants off. "Besides, Shinnosuke is<br/>Akane's boyfriend, not you."<p>Ryoga glared at him. "What?"<p>"You heard me," replied Ranma casually.<p>"That bastard is not Akane's boyfriend!"<br/>snarled Ryoga hatefully.<p>"Well, in any case, it's none of my business<br/>either way," said Ranma as he frowned at the boy.<p>"Where am I?" asked Ryoga with a distasteful<br/>snort.<p>"A park near the dojo in Nerima," said Ranma<br/>as he cheered up a little.<p>"So, I'm near to Akane?" asked the boy<br/>hopefully.<p>"I'd take you there myself, but I'm waiting<br/>for something," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Waiting?" said Ryoga in confusion.<p>"Yeah, this body should start do vanish in a<br/>minute or two," said the pigtailed boy as he<br/>looked at his hands expectantly.<p>"WHAT?" muttered Ryoga dumbly.<p>"I'm testing out a new technique," said Ranma.<br/>"Don't worry, it's just a side effect. I'll be<br/>fine."<p>"Oh," muttered the lost boy dumbly.<p>"Yeah, whatever."<p>"So, which direction is the Tendo Dojo then?"<br/>asked Ryoga.<p>"The direction you just came from," lied<br/>Ranma.<p>Ryoga nodded and started walking directly<br/>towards it.<p>"Hey, lucky him," said Carrot cheerfully. He<br/>glanced down at his hand and noticed his fingers<br/>were becoming transparent. "Hey. It's showtime. We<br/>got about...four hours and five minutes in."<p>Ranma nodded and they drained the last of<br/>their ki.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>They found themselves sitting in a small cafe,<br/>staring obsessively at someone's rear.<p>"Gah!" cried Carrot in shock as he quickly<br/>jerked their head away.<p>"Hey! I was watching that!" said Xianfu<br/>irritably.<p>"Obviously," grumbled Ranma.<p>"Hey guys," said Dan as he appeared as well.<br/>"We might not want to stand up for a minute or<br/>two."<p>"Huh?" said Carrot as he ignored the advice<br/>and immediately stumbled over their chair. "What<br/>the hell?"<p>"We got a little carried away," muttered Dan<br/>sheepishly.<p>"What the hell did you do to us?" cried Ranma<br/>in shock.<p>"We're drunk," said Carrot irritably. "Sit<br/>down again for a minute. We've got a lot of added<br/>mass now, it shouldn't last long."<p>"So, how was your day?" asked Xianfu.<p>"Fine," said Carrot with a shrug. "We spent<br/>the day in Nerima."<p>"I thought you said no fighting," snorted Dan.<p>"We didn't get into one all day," said Ranma.<p>"Good," said Xianfu coldly.<p>"How about you guys?" asked Carrot.<p>"Huh? We spent all day in a bar," said Dan<br/>cheerfully.<p>"I spent most of my day wandering around this<br/>area," said Xianfu.<p>"Well, I suppose we should go home then," said<br/>Carrot as he stood them up. The were a little<br/>light headed, but the group of them was able to<br/>keep them somewhat coordinated despite their<br/>drunken state.<p>++++++++++++++<p>The arrived home about an hour later and<br/>looked down at Usagi irritably. "What?"<p>"You've been gone all day?" she asked her<br/>mother with a frown on her face.<p>"Yeah? What of it?" snorted Yohiko.<p>The girl sighed and watched as her mother<br/>slowly lowered herself into an armchair. "I'm not<br/>moving from this spot for a very long time Usagi.<br/>Please don't bother me."<p>The girl shrugged and walked into the hallway.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Your performance was less than admirable,"<br/>said Yotsuya as he glared at Yusaku. They were<br/>sitting in the remains of his room. The boy still<br/>had a somewhat dazed look about him.<p>"Shut up, you're just mad she wouldn't let you<br/>watch," said the boy as he glared at the man.<p>"That has nothing to do with my objective<br/>opinion," said the man as he turned away.<p>"So Godai finally got lucky," said Itchinose<br/>as she took a drag off of her cigarette and looked<br/>at the remains of the wall for a moment.<p>"I dunno if I'd call that lucky," commented<br/>Akemi.<p>"She seemed pretty upset," said Itchinose.<p>Both women glared at Yusaku for a moment.<p>"Hey! I didn't, I mean, she came...I um...It's<br/>not like that! She made me do it!" cried the boy.<p>Usagi appeared in the doorway and sighed at<br/>the hole. "Well, I'm not sure what to say."<p>"Usagi!" cried the man as he fell at her feet.<br/>"Is she still angry? Tell her I'm sorry!"<p>"I'm not really sure. She hasn't said anything<br/>about it," said the girl with a shrug. "She was<br/>pretty upset though."<p>"Damn!" muttered the boy as he looked away<br/>from her. "I've got to do something! Help me! I'll<br/>do anything!"<p>Usagi sighed and sat down. "Look, I heard<br/>about what happened from Yotsuya, I'm not mad at<br/>you. I don't think she's too angry with you<br/>either. She seems more upset with herself about<br/>it. But..."<p>"But?" muttered Yusaku in horror.<p>"I'm not sure if there's anything you can do.<br/>I've never seen her this upset about something,"<br/>said the girl with a small sigh. "I think you blew<br/>it Yusaku, sorry."<p>"Nooooo!" cried the boy in horror. He fell<br/>face first into the floor and did not move.<p>"He took that remarkably well," commented<br/>Akemi.<p>"Indeed," agreed Itchinose as she took another<br/>drag off of her cigarette.<p>Usagi sat down and sighed.<p>"Now, on to this mysterious Xellos," said<br/>Yotsuya.<p>Everyone turned to look at Usagi.<p>"What? How many times do I gotta tell you?<br/>Don't look at me that way! I can't ruin his fun<br/>like that, he'll be angry if I do. You don't want<br/>him angry at you."<p>"Why not?" asked Akemi with a slightly worried<br/>looking frown.<p>"He gets this really disgustingly cute look on<br/>his face. It's so pathetic it's horrible! Then<br/>he'll start doing things. Like one time, I got him<br/>mad, so he froze all my panties, and then put them<br/>back in my drawer right before I woke up. Then<br/>later, he filled my shampoo bottle with shaving<br/>cream. After that, he made curry flavored waffles<br/>for breakfast..."<p>"How diabolical," said Yotsuya in horror.<p>"Yeah, tell me about it. You're just gonna<br/>have to figure him out on your own," agreed the<br/>girl.<p>+++++++++++<p>Carrot and the others sat around in the<br/>bedroom calmly. They were all looking at one<br/>another. Dan and Pissant were wearing a black<br/>leather jacket and shades, while Carrot and Ranma<br/>looked exactly the same, but without the jacket or<br/>shades. Xianfu was the only one currently in<br/>female form and she glared at her companions.<p>"So, roughly twice a day fully charged," said<br/>Carrot calmly.<p>"This is the third time," said Dan calmly.<p>"We probably only got about two hour's worth<br/>in this one," said Ranma calmly. "Besides, we<br/>don't need to be doin this stuff all the time."<p>"What?" said Xianfu angrily.<p>"He's right, we're weak afterwards. We're just<br/>testing the limits. I suggest we keep it down to<br/>maybe once a day, and we don't have to go for all<br/>four hours either. Think of it as sort of<br/>borrowing the car from mom or dad. Go out, get<br/>what you need, and come back." Carrot smirked at<br/>the looks on the other's faces.<p>Dan sighed and shrugged his shoulders.<br/>"Whatever. I can live with that."<p>"Well, I was hoping for a little more than<br/>that," grumbled Xianfu irritably. "But..."<p>"Well you can stop complaining right now<br/>bitch!" snarled Ranma as he jumped up and glared<br/>at her hatefully.<p>Dan arched his eyebrow at this and snorted.<p>"The hell! Look you jerk..." snapped the woman<br/>in retort.<p>"This is all your fault! Just cause you whine<br/>and..."<p>"Asshole! Do you have any idea what I was<br/>going through?" snarled Xianfu as she stuck her<br/>face into the pigtailed man's. Their foreheads<br/>touched together as they glared at each other.<p>"Brother," muttered Dan irritably.<p>"Yes I do thanks to you bitch! I ought to kill<br/>you for that!" snapped Ranma hatefully.<p>"Just try it!" snarled Xianfu.<p>"You're on!" retorted Ranma as he shoved her<br/>back and tackled her onto the floor.<p>Dan stood up and paused suddenly as he saw<br/>Usagi standing in the doorway watching the scene<br/>in shock.<p>He looked at the ground and then back at the<br/>girl again.<p>"Asshole!"<p>"Bitch!"<p>"Hey kid," he said as he walked up next to her<br/>and leaned against the wall.<p>"Mom!" cried the girl in alarm as the shock<br/>finally wore off.<p>"Don't worry about those two, they're always<br/>like this," said Dan calmly.<p>"Always? Who are you?" said Usagi as she<br/>backed away from him and looked at the fight with<br/>an uncertain frown. "Mom!" she started forward to<br/>help her mother but found a restraining hand on<br/>her shoulder.<p>"She'll be angry if you butt in on her fight<br/>kid," said Dan calmly.<p>Usagi blinked and looked up at him again. "Who<br/>are you?" She looked somewhat frightened.<p>Xellos walked into the room and smiled warmly.<br/>"Ah, just like old times eh, Dan?"<p>"Yeah, I suppose so," said the man at Usagi's<br/>side with a sly looking grin on his face.<p>Carrot and Xianfu were clutching at each<br/>other's throats and rolling around on the ground<br/>while kicking at each other. It wasn't even close<br/>to a martial arts match. "Uncle Xellos? You know<br/>these people?"<p>"Of course, they trained under my father with<br/>your mother to learn Martial arts. Carrot and<br/>Yohiko are old...friends..." said the man<br/>cheerfully. He looked somewhat uncertain at that<br/>last part.<p>"He's trying to kill her!" cried Usagi as she<br/>pointed at them and froze. A deep blush covered<br/>her face as she noticed they were no longer trying<br/>to kill each other, but were locked in a rather<br/>passionate, if somewhat violent, looking embrace.<br/>"Oh my!"<p>"Heh, come on kid," said Dan as he pulled her<br/>and Xellos out of the room and left the pair<br/>alone.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Usagi blinked as she looked at the man and<br/>frowned. "You trained with my mother in martial<br/>arts?"<p>"That's right," said Dan with a small nod. He<br/>smirked to himself at the irony, it wasn't really<br/>a lie.<p>"So, how come you never visited?" asked the<br/>girl as she frowned at them.<p>"What? You saw what Carrot and Yohiko are<br/>like," said Dan. "She was married, and she'd given<br/>up the art too. We'd heard she'd picked it up<br/>again and decided to stop by and see her."<p>"How did you know?" asked Usagi.<p>"I told them," said Xellos as he sipped at a<br/>small cup of tea.<p>"Oh," replied the girl as she frowned and<br/>turned her head slightly at some of the noises<br/>that were coming out of the room. She was blushing<br/>quite badly when she turned back.<p>"Man, I been hangin around Carrot too long,"<br/>thought Dan to himself.<p>"I'm surprised you were able to think all that<br/>up so quickly," agreed Pissant.<p>"Shaddap," grumbled Dan in his mind.<p>"Well, I think it's time we got some sleep,"<br/>said Xellos as he stood up and pat Usagi on the<br/>shoulder. "We've got things to do."<p>The girl nodded and stood up to go to her<br/>room.<p>Dan sighed and relaxed as he sat back in his<br/>chair.<p>++++++++++++<p>Xellos smiled at Usagi and looked at the wall<br/>next to them as it began to shake rather<br/>violently. "Um, perhaps it would be best if you<br/>went out for a while. We both know you aren't<br/>getting any sleep with...ahem...all this going on<br/>around here."<p>The girl blushed deeply and grinned at him.<br/>"Yeah. Thanks Uncle Xellos."<p>"Come back in a few hours or so," said the man<br/>as he walked out and left her alone.<p>Usagi nodded and stepped out of her window as<br/>her clothes transformed.<p>++++++++++++<p>A short time later she found herself jumping<br/>across rooftops with a huge grin on her face. "I'm<br/>gonna have to meet this Carrot later. If Mom likes<br/>him this much, he might be just what I need to get<br/>her over Dad!"<p>She landed in the middle of a small abandoned<br/>lot and blinked in surprise. A small tent was set<br/>up, with a familiar figure sitting in front of it<br/>with a pot of water boiling in front of him. He<br/>poured the water into his cup of ramen and set it<br/>down to cook.<p>"Ryoga?" she said out loud.<p>The boy jumped to his feet and blinked in<br/>surprise. "Sailor Moon?"<p>"Hey, it is you," she said as she walked over<br/>to him and smiled. "You know, this is the first<br/>time we've met when something wasn't trying to<br/>kill me."<p>"Um, yeah," replied the boy.<p>"What are you doing out here?" she asked him<br/>as she noticed his tent.<p>"My house is pretty far away from here," he<br/>muttered under his breath as he looked at the<br/>tent. "It's just easier this way."<p>"Oh," said the girl as she looked at his<br/>campsite and smiled. "Nice tent."<p>Ryoga blushed and quickly covered his crotch<br/>as he sat back down again and leaned over the<br/>fire. "Um, sit down if you'd like," he muttered<br/>nervously.<p>Usagi did, right next to him as opposed to<br/>opposite the fire where he had indicated. Ryoga<br/>was sweating bullets.<p>"Are you hungry? I made some...um..." he<br/>turned his head and noticed her staring directly<br/>at him.<p>"No thanks, I already ate," said the girl as<br/>she smiled at him. She turned her head up at the<br/>sky and leaned back in her seat. This put her<br/>breasts at Ryoga's eye level, and he found himself<br/>unable to move. "It sure is pretty out here," she<br/>commented while looking up at the stars.<p>"Yeah, um...pretty..." he muttered as he<br/>finally managed to tear his eyes away from her<br/>chest and look at his cup of noodles. He blinked<br/>as he saw a spot of red appear on his hand. "No!<br/>Not now!" His mind screamed as he desperately<br/>plugged his nose with a tissue he pulled from his<br/>pocket.<p>"Are you all right?" said Usagi as she moved<br/>in front of him and forced him to tilt his head<br/>back. Not before he managed to get an eyeful of<br/>her skintight uniform as she practically shoved it<br/>into his face without realizing it.<p>"I just feel a little light headed," he<br/>muttered pathetically.<p>"Oh my! You should lie down!" said the girl as<br/>she grabbed the blanket he had set out and forced<br/>him to lay on top of it.<p>"Are you hurt? What happened?" said the girl<br/>with a worried look in her face as she took his<br/>hand away from his nose and applied pressure to<br/>the wound.<p>"It's nothing, just..." he muttered weakly.<br/>"My god! I'm gonna pass out again," he said as he<br/>tried to sit up and move away from him.<p>In his flailing, he accidentally grabbed her<br/>chest and froze with his hand there as he realized<br/>what he'd done. "I...I'm sorry! I didn't mean<br/>too...I mean...I..."<p>Usagi looked slightly irritated for a moment<br/>and gently grabbed his hand. She sighed and shook<br/>her head. "You're not doing it right."<p>Ryoga went white as a sheet as she pressed his<br/>hand against her chest and slowly leaned forward<br/>to kiss him.<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA! I am so sick and evil!<br/>Heh. Anyway, this is going towards something, so<br/>don't worry... Next time: Vahn's Revenge!<p>
