</div>A long, long time ago, in a galaxy not very far away...<p>Insertion<p>Episode 22<p>A New Hope<p>It is a time of great tension. The Moon Kingdom is in a power<br/>struggle against an evil faction from a nearby solar system known as<br/>the Intergalactic Federation. Diplomatic missions have not gone well,<br/>and war seems eminent.<p>The evil Galactic Forces of Dark Valdis are converging for battle,<br/>in order to strike against the Moon Kingdom. Spies have brought vital<br/>information back to Queen Serenity in the hope of stopping the<br/>invasion before it becomes a conflict that destroys the fragile peace<br/>of the System. Along with unconfirmed reports of a super-weapon that<br/>could sway the balance of power.<p>Mindful of spies within her own empire, the Queen sends her own<br/>daughter, the Princess Serena with a message to the Galactic Imperial<br/>Fleet, lead by Admiral Jadeite.<p>The young princess was intercepted by enemy forces on her way to<br/>her transport on Earth, and now flees for her very life. Escaping to<br/>the surface of the planet, she is now chased by the evil forces of the<br/>Intergalactic Federation...<p>+++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome stood looking up at the sky. He'd been in this new<br/>place for almost two weeks now and had yet to meet a single soul. He<br/>was in a desolate place, surrounded by desert on all sides. Still,<br/>there was enough to sustain him. He stared down at the spiral he had<br/>drawn on the ground and frowned.<p>He was dressed in a black pair of pants, and had a white button up<br/>shirt on with the sleeves rolled up. They had developed a dark tan<br/>since arriving in the new place as well.<p>"You're sure about this?" muttered Dan as he looked at it.<p>"Well, I think we've got that 'Soul of Ice' thing down. The spiral<br/>is the only other part we need to learn," replied Carrot with a small<br/>shrug. "Unfortunately, without a sparring partner..."<p>"Right," agreed Ranma.<p>"We don't even know where we are, and you're worried about this<br/>stupid technique?" said Pissant.<p>"If we find a way back, we need to be ready," replied Ranma.<p>"We need to toughen up too, we aren't fast enough to get this to<br/>work easily," said Carrot with a small frown. "He's faster than us,<br/>and we're going to take a few hits at least."<p>"He's right," said Dan.<p>"What's that noise?" commented Ranma as he forced them to look at<br/>the horizon. A cloud of dust could be seen moving towards them in the<br/>distance. It was too small to be a sandstorm though, and several<br/>sparkles could be seen reflecting off the surface of some metal.<p>"Some kind of car?" said Carrot as he raised their hand to shield<br/>his eyes.<p>A whining hum became more audible as the things approached. It was<br/>obvious there were several of them. They were all moving at high<br/>speed.<p>"Visitors," said Dan with a small frown.<p>Their forms became clearer as they closed in at high speed. There<br/>was one large vehicle, and seven smaller ones. They were all hovering<br/>above the sand and blasting forward.<p>"It's a chase," said Carrot as he noted energy bolts being fired<br/>at the larger craft. "What the hell?"<p>"Get ready," said Ranma.<p>"That big one isn't returning fire, I don't think it's armed,"<br/>commented Dan.<p>"Pirates?" asked Carrot.<p>"Could be," said Dan.<p>"Oh no. This is very bad," whined Pissant.<p>The smaller vehicles were like bikes with jet engines attached to<br/>them. The larger ship looked somewhat like a boat with a flat bottom.<br/>They were blowing huge clouds of dust up.<p>"What do we do?" asked Ranma with a slight tensing in his voice.<p>"Hopefully they won't notice us," said Dan.<p>Carrot had pulled something off of their belt and was holding it<br/>ready. It was a long rod made of metal, they had it on them when they<br/>were transported, but didn't get the chance to use it in the battle<br/>before.<p>"They're heading right for us," said Ranma as the things moved<br/>closer. They blasted by him, blowing up a cloud of sand in their path<br/>as they roared through the area loudly.<p>"Shit!" cried Dan angrily as they shielded their face. They spun<br/>around to watch the group move off.<p>"Two of them are circling back," said Carrot as he noticed two of<br/>the bike like hovercraft break off of the main group and turn back<br/>towards him.<p>A four-foot long blade of red light shot from the metal rod and he<br/>readied himself in a kendo stance.<p>"Here they come!" said Ranma.<p>The men were dressed in black uniforms of some kind. The bikes had<br/>long front ends with foils attached to the tips for steering. They<br/>also had a laser mounted just below the foils. One of the bikes fired,<br/>and Ranma moved the blade at impossible speeds, blocking the shots<br/>with the blade and sending them ricocheting away. The two vehicles<br/>passed him on either side, blowing up a gust of wind that knocked him<br/>off of his feet.<p>The boy rolled back onto his feet as they circled around for<br/>another pass.<p>"Get close to that one," snapped Carrot as he edged them closer to<br/>where one of the bikes would pass.<p>"What? Are you crazy?" snapped Ranma.<p>"Do it!" agreed Dan.<p>The bikes passed by again, shooting another volley of laser blasts<br/>at him. The blade worked in a blur once again, preventing any of the<br/>shots from striking. As the one nearest to them moved by, the other<br/>side of the weapon came to life, creating a double bladed weapon.<br/>There was a spray of blood as the man fell in half. His bike continued<br/>on with his lower half, and slowed quickly before crashing into the<br/>sand a short distance away.<p>The remaining bike turned around again for another pass, it slowed<br/>to a stop though a good distance away from them. It fired off a few<br/>shots, and Ranma simply ignored them. They hit the ground around him<br/>kicking up sand. He simply stared the man down coldly.<p>"I'm going to try something," said Carrot with a frown forming on<br/>his face.<p>"What?" muttered Ranma.<p>Carrot simply smirked as he reached out with his chi. "If I can<br/>make a chi ball, I think I can do this too."<p>"What are you doing?" muttered Dan as he felt the power doing<br/>something.<p>"No! Stop it!" cried Pissant as he suddenly realized what was<br/>going on.<p>The biker was lifted up off of his bike by an unseen force. He<br/>grabbed at his neck desperately and kicked his feet as he slowly<br/>choked in mid air.<p>"Whoa!" muttered Ranma in shock.<p>Carrot gave a grunt of effort, and the man's head popped off of<br/>his shoulders. He blinked as the body slumped to the ground. "Oops,<br/>too much..."<p>"No kidding," said Dan in awe. "Man, that was cool."<p>"Yeah, I'm tired though. That was much harder than I'd thought,"<br/>said Carrot weakly.<p>Ranma ignored them and turned to look off in the distance at the<br/>slowly fading dust cloud. He turned back towards the bike and frowned.<p>"What the hell are you thinking about?" said Dan.<p>"We're goin after em," said Ranma as he started to jog towards the<br/>vehicle.<p>"What? No way! Do you have any idea how to pilot this thing?"<br/>snapped Dan.<p>"Yeah. I used to have one," said Ranma calmly as he straddled the<br/>hover bike and started to flip switches.<p>"Oh," said Dan dumbly.<p>"At least we know there's people here," said Carrot cheerfully. "I<br/>get the feeling this is about to get even more interesting though."<p>"You enjoy things like this too much," said Pissant.<p>They shot forward like a bullet, leaving the dead men where they<br/>lay.<p>++++++++++++<p>The howl of the bikers behind them was all they could hear.<br/>"Princess! Stay low!" cried one of the three men around her.<p>"AAAAAAHHHHHH!" screamed the girl desperately as she ducked below<br/>another bolt of light. One of the men fell off the side clutching at<br/>his chest. "NO!"<p>"What are we going to do? All the bodyguards are dead!" cried one<br/>of the men desperately as he looked at his only remaining companion.<p>"We've got to get away!" snapped the other man desperately as<br/>small explosions rocked the ship as more laser fire hit it. Luckily,<br/>the ship was made to take a bit of punishment, and the weapons they<br/>were using where relatively low level.<p>"What the hell?" said the pilot as he looked on the horizon.<p>"What is it?"<p>"Up ahead, I see some canyons! Maybe we can lose them in those<br/>rocks!" cried the man.<p>"Go then!"<p>"Do something!" cried the princess as she cowered on the floor of<br/>the ship.<p>"Don't worry princess, we'll get a...AAAAAAA!" another of the ships<br/>crew fell away, leaving only the pilot.<p>"We're not gonna make it!" cried the man desperately as he looked<br/>over his shoulder.<p>Another shot struck the ship, and it lurched forward suddenly,<br/>impacting on the ground and flipping over itself several times as it<br/>tore itself apart along the ground.<p>The princess had been thrown out early and was lying face first on<br/>the ground. The pilot hadn't been so lucky, the ship exploded in a<br/>ball of fire a short distance away as she looked on in horror. The<br/>bike gang buzzed past her and she staggered to her feet. "I've got to<br/>get out of here!" She turned and ran towards the rock formations<br/>nearby, hoping for some cover. The bikes had turned around already,<br/>and the first few bolts of laser fire exploded around her. They closed<br/>in towards her, one in particular bearing down on her directly. "No!"<br/>she gasped as she realized that they had no intention of taking her<br/>alive.<p>The bikes buzzed by her again and she fell to the ground from the<br/>force of their passing. She looked up and gasped as she saw the one<br/>that had been heading towards her spinning out of control before he<br/>slammed into a pillar of stone and exploded. She gasped as she saw the<br/>steering foils lying in the sand in front of her, cut off neatly. A<br/>shadow loomed over her and she looked up.<p>A boy of about sixteen years old was sitting on one of the bikes<br/>with his hand extended down. He was wearing strange glasses with a<br/>tint too them much to dark for her to see his eyes.<p>"Who?" she muttered.<p>"Come with me if you want to live," said the boy with a stony<br/>expression on his face.<p>She took his hand and he pulled her up behind him. "Hold on."<p>"Who are you?" she muttered.<p>"Talk later, run now," he replied as he noticed the bike gang<br/>moving towards him. He opened up the engine and blasted forward into<br/>the canyon.<p>The princess squealed in fright as they passed over and through<br/>the narrow passageways of the canyon at top speed. Ranma's expression<br/>was cold as he stared forward without looking back.<p>The bike gang had followed and showed their skill by keeping close<br/>behind him. Occasionally they would be sprayed with stones as a<br/>careless blast exploded nearby.<p>"Hold on tight," said Ranma.<p>"Huh?" muttered the girl in confusion.<p>The boy made a sharp turn off the side of a cliff and kicked the<br/>rear of the bike out, turning it sideways in mid air. The vehicle<br/>shifted and landed directly next to the opposite wall, barely managing<br/>not to slam into the side of the smaller crack they had just dove<br/>into.<p>Two of the bikers managed to duplicate the maneuver. The other two<br/>slammed into the wall and exploded in a ball of flames.<p>After a moment, the canyon widened suddenly into an open field,<br/>there were a few rock formations scattered around, creating natural<br/>bridges and tunnels.<p>Ranma frowned as he noticed a particularly small portion of stone.<br/>It was a small pillar with a hoop at the top; it was just large<br/>enough. "Duck."<p>"Huh?" muttered the princess as she looked at him for a moment and<br/>then turned her eyes forward. "No! You're crazyyyyyyy!" she screamed<br/>as they blasted through the loop.<p>One of the others made it through; kicking on his air brakes to<br/>slow his decent he turned and followed them as they moved back into<br/>the narrow passageways again. The other was nothing more than a<br/>flaming pile of debris.<p>Ranma growled as the man pulled up beside him, he reached out for<br/>the princess and grabbed her hair. The girl squealed in pain and fear<br/>as the man tried to lift her out of her seat.<p>There was a snapping noise followed by a distinctive hiss. The man<br/>looked from the girl and back down to his chest. He was still holding<br/>on to her hair and she stared back at him as he finally noticed the<br/>blade of red light that was sticking through his chest.<p>He released the princess and Ranma turned the bike off to the<br/>side.<p>The other merely screamed as he tried to correct his own steering.<br/>It was too late, and he exploded as his vehicle slammed into the wall<br/>of the canyon.<p>Ranma slowed and looked back for a moment as he realized that all<br/>the attackers were beaten.<p>"WOOOOOW! That was so cool!" exclaimed the young princess<br/>excitedly.<p>Ranma turned to look at her and did a double take. "Usagi?"<p>"Rabbit? Where?" said the princess as she looked around.<p>"Never mind, we're leaving," he said as he brought the bike to<br/>life again and drove them away.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"So, um. Who are you?" said the young blond girl as she looked up<br/>at her mysterious savior. They were sitting around a small campfire as<br/>the sun set in the distance.<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome. Who the hell are you?" said the boy as he<br/>looked at her.<p>"You mean...you don't know?" said the girl dumbly.<p>The boy shook his head for a moment and grinned at her.<p>"I am the Princess Serenity! Heir to the throne, ruler of the<br/>Galaxy, Future leader of its armies, and soon to be leader of the<br/>Senshi. My friends call me Princess Serena, but you're a commoner, so<br/>Your Highness will have to do."<p>"Hey. I got news for you Serena. You're leading two things right<br/>now. Jack and Shit, and Jack left town," said the boy sourly.<p>"Huh?" said the girl as she stared at him for a moment. This was<br/>not how dashing heroes were supposed to act.<p>"Look, I've got to find some place to dump you off so you can get<br/>back to wherever it is you belong. Got any ideas?"<p>"I can't go back! I have to go to Mercury!" said the princess.<p>"Right. I'll just fly us there with this bike," replied Ranma<br/>flatly.<p>"But, you've got to help me! I mean..."<p>"Look. I'll just take you back, and you can use that royalty stuff<br/>to get yourself a ride to wherever you're supposed to go. How's that?"<br/>said the boy cheerfully.<p>Serena was perplexed. This guy wasn't being very romantic at all.<br/>Things like this just didn't work this way, there was a certain way<br/>these things had to be played. He was screwing it up.<p>"I think I saw a sign for a town a few miles away. We can make it<br/>there tomorrow," he said as he looked out at the horizon. "Then I can<br/>dump you off with the authorities, and go on my own way. I've got<br/>things to do."<p>"Aha! He's already on a quest!" said Serena as she smirked to<br/>herself. "Are you trying to find someone or something?"<p>"Huh? Naw. I've got to train," said the boy cheerfully.<p>"Train?" muttered Usagi dumbly.<p>"Yeah. I've got a lot to learn before I can go back to where I<br/>belong. Then I can kick that guy's ass!" said Ranma as he clenched his<br/>fists. "I'd better beat up that little brat while I'm at it. That<br/>witch, how dare she do that to me!"<p>Serena blinked, the boy was laughing to himself. He almost looked,<br/>well, evil. "Are you all right?"<p>"Huh? Oh, I'm fine," he replied as he sat down. "I'm goin to<br/>sleep. Goodnight." He pulled his blanket over his body and rolled away<br/>from her. Within moments he was snoring loudly.<p>Serena simply stared at him, it was the most horrible sound she'd<br/>ever heard. "This is my prince charming?" She thought back to the<br/>young Endimyon. "Well, he is a flake...but he doesn't seem all that<br/>bad right now." She sighed and lay on the ground. "I guess I'd better<br/>sleep too."<p>++++++++++++++<p>"What?" Serenity gasped in shock as one of the Senshi bowed before<br/>her.<p>"The princess never arrived at her destination. We found the<br/>bodies of her bodyguards and some unknown men. There wasn't much<br/>left," said Jupiter as she stared at the ground.<p>"My daughter?" said the queen as she stood up with her hand held<br/>over her mouth.<p>"Not found. Possibly kidnapped, or ..."<p>"Find her! Bring her back to me at once!" snapped the queen.<p>"Of course," said the woman as she looked up at her queen with a<br/>frown burned onto her face.<p>Serenity turned towards one of her attendants. "Contact Pluto, I<br/>want to know everything she knows about this."<p>"Don't bother," said Setsuna as she walked into the room and<br/>stared at them for a moment.<p>"You said nothing of this," said Jupiter coldly as she glared at<br/>the girl.<p>"I knew nothing of this. Something clouds the stream of time,<br/>something is not right. I cannot see what it is though," replied the<br/>Senshi of Time calmly.<p>"So?" said Serenity.<p>"So, I cannot see your daughter's possible fates, it is dark to<br/>me," replied the woman coldly. "I will inform you if I learn more, do<br/>not summon me until then. I cannot be distracted this way."<p>Serenity nodded and turned towards Jupiter. "Find her, bring her<br/>back to me, at any cost."<p>"As you wish," said Jupiter as she bowed to the woman deeply.<p>"What is this place?" muttered Serena in disgust as she held her<br/>nose and stared at the dusty buildings below them.<p>"Tal Shitar. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and<br/>villainy," replied Ranma flatly.<p>"Oh," muttered the girl in surprise. "What are we doing here?"<p>"Well, we're going to need a ship to take us to the moon," replied<br/>the boy with a smirk.<p>"The moon?" said the girl dumbly.<p>"I'm not turning you over to anyone here. Any other town would<br/>take us three days to reach. The moon is a four hour trip for most<br/>ships, maybe seven if we can get on a barge for cheap enough."<p>"So, it's the fastest way do dump me off?" muttered Serena<br/>irritably.<p>"Hey. You've got it," said the boy with an oblivious smile.<p>++++++++++++<p>"What's your business here?" said a rough looking guard at one of<br/>the gates that entered the spaceport. Ranma was sitting on his bike<br/>with Serena behind him. She was wearing a heavy brown cloak to hide<br/>identity.<p>Ranma waved his hand in front of the man's face and smirked.<br/>"These aren't the droids you're looking for."<p>"What? What the hell are you talking about kid?" snorted the man<br/>angrily.<p>"It's nothing, private joke," said the boy with a small chuckle.<br/>"We're looking for transport to the moon. You know of a place where we<br/>can find it?"<p>"There's a commercial liner in the next town. Three days away,"<br/>said the man flatly.<p>"I'm in a bit of a hurry. I'd rather not pay commercial fare<br/>either," replied the boy with a small shrug.<p>"Try that place," said the guard as he pointed out a small dirty<br/>looking bar.<p>"Right," said the boy calmly as he pulled away.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"You're selling the bike?" said Serena dumbly as she watched him<br/>take the money from a group of teens.<p>"That's right, it's worth the price of a trip to the moon at<br/>least," said the boy with a shrug. "Probably three or four trips<br/>honestly."<p>"Oh."<p>"Well, let's go find ourselves a ride then,"<p>+++++++++++++<p>"What's your business here?" said the rough looking guard as he<br/>looked down at his clipboard as someone else drove up to his gate in a<br/>land speeder.<p>"That's none of your concern," said the icy voice in reply.<p>"Huh?" said the guard as he looked up. He sputtered in shock for a<br/>moment and bowed his head. "Forgive me!"<p>Jupiter nodded as he opened the gate and stared foreword. "This is<br/>the closest spaceport, and the most likely place where they'd try to<br/>take her off planet." Her thoughts were cut off as she glanced around<br/>and noticed the large number of bars. There were probably hundreds of<br/>smugglers and shifty traders. Any of them would be willing to<br/>transport the kidnapped princess for the right price.<p>++++++++++++<p>"So, you're looking for passage to the moon?" said the green<br/>haired woman who sat across from them. She looked to be in her early<br/>twenties and had hair that fell down to the middle of her back. She<br/>was very pretty, except for the eye patch that covered her eye. She<br/>was wearing a white shirt and tight black pants with a blaster at her<br/>side.<p>"That's right. We'd like something quiet," said the boy with a<br/>smirk.<p>"Well, that's the trick isn't it? It's going to cost you something<br/>extra," said the woman coldly.<p>"Sure," said the boy with a small shrug. "But how much extra?"<p>"5,000," said the woman as she sat back in her chair.<p>"I'll hire you for 4,000," said the boy calmly. "I know I can find<br/>someone here who will gladly do it for 3."<p>The woman smirked at him, "Deal. My name is Hanna."<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome, and this is Serena," replied the boy calmly.<br/>"When are you leaving?"<p>"Well, we should be ready any time now. It's a cargo ship, I run<br/>interplanetary freight mostly. Exotic foods, things like that."<p>"Huh?" muttered Serena. "I thought you were a smuggler or<br/>something."<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed the woman as she threw back her head and gave a<br/>rough snort. "Sorry Honey. I'm legit, taking passengers isn't illegal<br/>you know."<p>"Oh, sorry," replied the girl with an embarrassed blush.<p>"Sorry to disappoint honey, but how many corn fields do you see on<br/>Mars?"<p>"None of course," replied the girl.<p>"But they eat corn don't they?"<p>"Um, yes..."<p>"Well, how do you think it gets there. There's a few smugglers<br/>here, but this is mostly a shipping port." The woman pat her on the<br/>back and smiled gently. "You got to quit readin all those fantasy<br/>programs kid. I'm in dock three. Meet me there in a few minutes and<br/>I'll be ready."<p>"Right," said Ranma. "Serena, you go with her. I'm gonna go buy<br/>some supplies. We'll have a bit of traveling to do once we reach the<br/>moon too."<p>"Huh?" said the girl in surprise.<p>"We aren't going to land at the palace. The spaceport is on the<br/>other side of the moon," said Ranma calmly. "It'll probably take us<br/>two days to reach it when we get there."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"This is it?" said Serena as she looked at the large craft in<br/>front of her.<p>"Not very impressive?" said the woman with her eyebrow arched.<p>"Well, I don't really know what I was expecting," admitted the<br/>girl.<p>"It's a fast ship," replied the woman with a small shrug. "She may<br/>not look like much, but she's got it where it counts."<p>"Right. Is it safe?" muttered Serena flatly.<p>"I'm still here aren't I?" replied the woman with a slightly<br/>annoyed frown.<p>"Oh, I guess so then," replied the princess cheerfully.<p>++++++++++++<p>"I'm getting traces of her DNA, fairly new," muttered Jupiter as<br/>she scanned the space port with a binocular shaped scanning device.<br/>"She's still here."<p>Ranma walked out of a nearby store with a bag over his shoulder<br/>and blinked. There was a large area of clearance around the woman, and<br/>she was easily recognizable. "Jupiter?" he muttered dumbly.<p>She looked at him with a strange device of some kind and slowly<br/>lowered them. The smile on her face was not nice at all. "So, you have<br/>her then."<p>"Hey! This is great!" said the boy cheerfully as he started to<br/>walk up to her.<p>She jumped forward, an arc of energy forming in her hands as she<br/>dove towards him. "Where is the princess!"<p>"What the?" he gasped as he jumped back.<p>"You will pay for your insolence," she said as she slowly stood up<br/>and glared at him. In her hand was a war hammer made out of<br/>lightening.<p>"Hey! Hold on a minute!" he sputtered as he backed away from her.<br/>"I'm trying to..."<p>"Die! I don't need you to find her!" she snarled as she charged<br/>forward.<p>Ranma moved before she could react. A blade of red light met her<br/>weapon and she gasped in surprise.<p>"Cool off!" snapped the boy as he shoved forward with his hand. He<br/>didn't even touch her and she was thrown back into a bucket of water.<p>The senshi of Jupiter screamed in pain as the liquid reacted to<br/>her powers.<p>Ranma cursed under his breath and dashed towards the spaceport.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Well, a girl has to defend herself right?" said Hanna as she<br/>hugged the large barrels of the lasers on the underside of her ship.<p>"I guess so, but why so big?" she said.<p>"Honey, these aren't for shooting people ya know. This is for<br/>other ships."<p>"Oh," said the girl with a small frown. Naturally she had seen<br/>warships, but this seemed like a little much for a ship as small as<br/>this one.<p>Ranma burst through a doorway and rushed up to them.<p>"Huh?" muttered Hanna.<p>"Go! Now!" cried the boy as he rushed up to them.<p>"What the?" muttered the woman dumbly.<p>He rushed by and pulled them both into the ship bodily.<p>"What the hell are you doing?" snapped the woman as she jerked her<br/>arm away from him.<p>"We've got to get the hell out of here! Right now!" said the boy<br/>as he stared at her.<p>"Why should I?" snapped the woman in retort.<p>"Hey! It's...Jupiter?" Serena's face went from pleased to<br/>uncertain in a matter of seconds. "What is she doing?"<p>"Trying to kill me!" snapped Ranma angrily.<p>The Senshi was walking through the crowd of people shocking anyone<br/>who moved in her way with a field of energy around herself. She looked<br/>up at the ship that her target had disappeared into and scowled even<br/>deeper. "You won't escape."<p>Ranma swallowed as he read her lips. "The Jupiter I know sure as<br/>hell isn't this strong!" he thought.<p>"What the hell have you gotten me into!" snapped Hanna in shocked<br/>horror.<p>"Go!" snapped Ranma angrily as he took the seat next to her. She<br/>worked furiously at the switches and started the engines.<p>"Shields are up!" said Ranma, "Weapons on line." His panic<br/>suddenly turned into a cool smile.<p>"What the hell are you...NO!" cried Hanna.<p>Ranma turned the laser turrets and fired a few blasts into the<br/>doorway where Jupiter was approaching from. It shattered and crumbled<br/>down, blocking the senshi's path.<p>"My career is over!" cried the woman as they lifted off. "I'll<br/>never run freight again! Waaaaahhhh!"<p>"This is so cool," said Serena cheerfully. She removed her hood<br/>and leaned over the shoulders of both pilots.<p>"Um, is that who I think it is?" said Hanna as she noticed the<br/>girl's face and hair finally.<p>"Yup," replied Ranma.<p>The doorway he had blocked off shattered back open suddenly.<br/>Jupiter was standing with the hammer in her hands and glaring<br/>hatefully at the ship as it lifted off. "No you don't!" she screamed<br/>as she raised her hand. A bolt of power came down from the sky,<br/>narrowly missing the ship as it blasted upwards.<p>She glared at them as they flew away and frowned. The hammer in<br/>her hand vanished and she turned to walk back to her own ship.<p>++++++++++++<p>"I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!" cried Hanna as they finally broke<br/>through the atmosphere of the planet.<p>"Relax would you? We got a way," said Ranma calmly.<p>"What the hell is that?" said Hanna as she noticed something<br/>really large approaching them. It was between them and the moon.<p>"It's a battle cruiser, a little one," replied Ranma calmly as he<br/>began to work some of the controls on the ship. "I'm bringing the<br/>shields up to the front."<p>"We've got to get the hell out of here!" said Hanna desperately.<p>"Why? Hail them, I'm sure they'll be more reasonable than Jupiter<br/>was," said Ranma calmly.<p>"Um, okay..." the woman reached for the communication controls.<br/>She was stopped when the ship suddenly jolted.<p>"What the hell are they trying to do?" muttered Ranma as he saw<br/>another volley of laser fire blast towards them. "They're trying to<br/>kill us!"<p>"Um, we should probably run away," said Serena nervously.<p>"Can't you tell them to stop or something?" said Hanna as she<br/>stared at the princess.<p>"Oh. Oh yeah," said Serena with a thoughtful look on her face.<br/>"I'll just tell them to stop..."<p>"We just lost communications," said Ranma with a sour frown.<p>"What?" cried the two women.<p>"Oops, there goes the shield," said the boy as he watched the<br/>power readout drop. "We're doomed."<p>"Fuck this!" screamed Hanna as she pulled a set of levers on the<br/>console.<p>"What was that?" said Serena dumbly. A split second later, she was<br/>thrown off of her feet and slammed into the back wall of the cabin.<p>Ranma smirked as the stars outside the cabin suddenly became lines<br/>of white light. "Well, this is certainly interesting."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"What happened?" said the young Endimyon as he stood on the bridge<br/>of the cruiser and glared at the captain.<p>"A warp drive in a ship that small?" muttered the man in shock.<br/>"That's..."<p>"It's an interplanetary freighter. Of course it has a warp drive,"<br/>said the young prince flatly.<p>The captain sputtered in shock. "We used standard practice for a<br/>ship that size, incapacitate the shields and take out the engines."<p>"The only problem is, you're used to dealing with small class<br/>fighters," commented the boy calmly. "Now Serenity is who knows where.<br/>If you don't find my fiancee, I'm going to have your command taken<br/>away Captain."<p>"Yes my lord!" said the man as he jerked his arm up in a salute.<p>"Don't worry Serena. I'm coming," said the boy to himself as he<br/>ignored the man and looked out over the stars.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>
