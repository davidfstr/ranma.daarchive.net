</div>Insertion<p>Part 43<p>Ready to Rumble.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Ranma looked up and blinked as Akane glared at him angrily. She wiped some sweat off of her brow from the light practice she had just completed and tapped her foot on the floor in irritation.<p>"Yes it's today!" she snapped at the bewildered looking boy.<p>"Dang, been so busy I forgot," he muttered as he frowned at her. She was dressed in a leotard with a pair of gymnastics clubs in her hands.<p>"It figures," snapped the girl as she turned away from him and stomped up the stairs. "I'm going to get ready now. You're coming with me!"<p>"Aw man. Do I have to?" he grumbled irritably.<p>"Yup," said Chibi-Usa cheerfully as she smiled at him from her place at the table.<p>"If I have to go, so do you," snapped Ranma as he walked outside and floated into the air.<p>"What? No fair!" cried the girl. "Hey! Where do you think you're going ape?"<p>"Don't worry about it, go with Akane. I promise I'll be there in time for the match. It doesn't start until three right?"<p>The little girl frowned at him, but nodded her head. If there was one thing that her father had never done to her, it was lie. He had about three hours till it started so he had time before he had to be at St. Hebereke.<p>++++++++++++<p>A short time later...<p>Ranma spun around, slashing at Tenchi with his lightsaber. He had a feral look in his eyes as he hacked at the boy relentlessly.<p>"Stop it! What are you doing?" cried Tenchi as he was backed away forcibly, barely able to keep Tenchi-ken in the path of the red blade. "Hey!"<p>Ranma performed a sweeping attack with the sword, forcing Tenchi to jump up. Halfway through the move, he turned it into an upward strike aimed at the boy's crotch. Tenchi managed to block it as he flipped back and gasped as he paused to check himself. "Good, still there."<p>"Are you finished yet?" snarled Ranma.<p>"Tenchi!" cried Ryoko as she struggled against the invisible field of energy that held her in place. She growled in frustration and tried to escape even harder. "You leave him alone you bastard!"<p>Ranma paused and smirked at her. "When I'm finished with him, you're next."<p>"What?" cried the boy fearfully.<p>"Defend yourself boy!" snarled Ranma as a dark power seemed to surge through his body. His eyes seemed to darken as well as he snarled and performed a complicated attack pattern that drove Tenchi back even further, forcing him up to the edge of a nearby cliff.<p>Tenchi staggered to keep his balance as a few stones fell off the ledge behind him. "Whoa! No way!" he muttered to himself as he prepared for the next attack.<p>Ranma came in low and fast, slashing at the boy's feet and taking out a portion of the ground where he stood. The attack turned Ranma's back to him, and he glanced over his shoulder to see Tenchi descending from above with the sword over his head.<p>"I've got you!" cried the boy. He landed and froze as another blade shot from the other end of the weapon, pointing directly at his nose. He edged back slightly as Ranma stood up and the blade the tip of Tenchi's nose.<p>"You just died," said Ranma calmly as he turned around and kept the weapon pointed at the boy, both sides were ignited now. "You have to expect the unexpected. I see what you mean, he's very green."<p>"Huh?" muttered Tenchi as the boy shut down the weapon and smirked at him.<p>Ryoko blinked in surprise as the energy holding her suddenly came to a stop.<p>Yosho appeared from a nearby grove of trees, his hands on Ayeka's shoulders. The princess looked quite upset at the moment and was glaring at Ranma hatefully. The old man nodded sagely and sighed. "Indeed, he's done well so far, but his lack of experience in a real battle definitely shows."<p>"Yes. He has trouble committing to his blows," agreed Ranma. "One cannot face a real opponent without total commitment. Regardless of whether one is attacking, or being attacked."<p>"Very true," said Yosho.<p>"What the heck is going on here?" snapped Ryoko as she glared at the pair.<p>"I asked your father to help me test Tenchi's ability, so that I might see what area's he needs to be trained in," commented Yosho. "He still needs much work."<p>"You mean...this was some sort of test?" muttered Ayeka. She had tried to stop the battle, but Yosho had managed to intercept her before anyone else noticed she was there.<p>"Indeed," said Yosho.<p>"He's not my dad!" snapped Ryoko.<p>"You wound me," commented Ranma as he gave her a dry looking stare.<p>"Deal with it kid!" retorted the woman.<p>"Now Ryoko, that's no way to talk to your father," said Washuu playfully as she walked out into the clearing.<p>"What the heck do you want?" snapped Ryoko as she glared at her.<p>"I came out to see him," said Washuu as she looked at Ranma and smiled.<p>"Well. I can see you haven't given her gems back. Thank you," he said cheerfully as he bowed to her politely.<p>"It was no trouble. I just created a field around her that'll prevent her from creating any more of her own for a while either. At least until she figures out that transformation," said the redhead as she smirked to herself.<p>"And a time after that as well. Just knowing how to do it isn't enough, I want to be sure she can use it," said Ranma with a small frown.<p>"Done," said Washuu cheerfully. "However, she'll never be as strong as your other daughter. Not in that respect at least."<p>"I thought as much," said Ranma with a small nod. "Chibi-Usa will be born after I've acquired my tail."<p>"Yes. I did some checking, your genetic makeup has definitely changed somehow. It's very subtle, almost to the point where I couldn't tell, but it is there."<p>"Hmmm," muttered Ranma as he closed his eyes and nodded. "So...Chibi-Usa and I are the only true Saiyans then. Barring any other children from the future of course."<p>"That's right," said Washuu calmly. "In fact, I think it's very likely that the Saiyan race has been recreated through you."<p>"Oh? What makes you think that?" asked Ranma.<p>"It's still a hunch, I'll get back to you on that one," said Washuu as she smirked at him.<p>"All right, no big hurry," said Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"So, he's like some sort of great warrior thing now?" muttered Ryoko in confusion.<p>"Humph. Wars do not make one great," commented Ranma.<p>"A true warrior is one who strives for peace, using his sword only to find a greater inner peace," commented Yosho.<p>"Zen through the mastery of the sword," said Ranma with a smirk forming on his face.<p>"Something like that, yes," said Yosho as he coughed into his hand.<p>"This from a man who gallantly rushed away from his throne in favor of fighting a space pirate?" said the pigtailed boy with a small chuckle.<p>"Well..." commented Yosho with a blush on his face.<p>"Hey. You're one to talk. I seem to recall you enjoying yourself quite a bit during that space battle..." said Washuu.<p>"Yes. I suppose I did," said Ranma honestly. "I never claimed to be great. I'm just the best there is at what I do, nothing great about that."<p>"Hmmm," said Yosho with a smirk forming on his face. "There is always someone better."<p>"All meet their own demons in their own ways," replied Ranma. "Such is the way of Bushido."<p>"Ah," said the old man cheerfully.<p>"Argh! Stop that! You're making my brain hurt!" cried Ryoko as she moved between them and grabbed them both by their collars.<p>Sasami walked out and paused as she noticed Ranma standing in the middle of the crowd. "Oh. Hello again!"<p>"Well, hello Sasami," said Ranma as he knelt down beside her.<p>"Are you staying for lunch?" asked the girl as she looked at the others expectantly. "It's almost ready."<p>"No he isn't," snapped Ryoko.<p>"Ryoko! Don't be rude!" snapped Tenchi. He turned towards Ranma. "You're welcome to stay of course..."<p>"No, I'd love to, but I've got somewhere to be tonight. Ryoko is coming with me in fact," said the boy as he smiled at her.<p>"Huh?" muttered the woman as she uncrossed her arms and stared at him.<p>"I'm not going to have time to train you before then, and I've got to be at Hotaru's afterward. So you're coming with me today," said Ranma as he glared at her.<p>"Why should I?" snapped Ryoko.<p>Washuu peered at the woman for a minute and slapped her fist in her palm. "You know. She's about due for a checkup..."<p>"Okay. I'll go," said Ryoko as she turned to look at him.<p>"Well, I'd hate to take you away. I mean, getting a checkup is important..." said Ranma.<p>"I'm going with you. Quit joking around!" snapped Ryoko desperately.<p>"I suppose I could talk her into doing the checkup later..." said Ranma with a small sigh.<p>"You realize that I hate you," said Ryoko as she glared at Washuu.<p>"What? I'm just concerned about my daughter's health and wellbeing!" cried Washuu dramatically. "Come here and give your momma a hug!"<p>"Can we go now?" muttered Ryoko as she moved behind Ranma.<p>"Well, we've still got about two hours..." started the boy.<p>"Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!" laughed Ayeka. "So, the monster woman can't even hug her own mother?"<p>"You stay out of this!" snapped Ryoko.<p>"Well, it's so obvious. Look how she treats her own family Tenchi! She'll become cold and unloving to her husband!" said the princess as she leaned on the boy's shoulder.<p>"Hey. Don't be like that..." started Tenchi as he looked at her.<p>"It's true!" insisted Ayeka dramatically.<p>"Say Princess. You look a little pale yourself. When was the last time you went to the doctor for a checkup?" said Washuu as she peered at the girl for a moment and snapped a rubber glove onto her hand.<p>Ayeka froze and stared at her in horror. "Why...I just went last week of course! I feel perfectly fine! No problems here!" She backed away, laughing nervously.<p>Tenchi didn't say a word, and merely stood in silence.<p>"Are you sure? Earth doctor's technology could never find half of the Jurian diseases that could practically infest this planet..." Washuu looked up at the sky and tapped her chin thoughtfully. "I think it's best if we do some tests...just to be safe..."<p>"I ummm...eep." Ayeka was off like a shot, rushing down the shrine stairs. "I've just remembered that I'd forgotten something at the house!" she cried.<p>"That's okay. I'll meet her there," said Washuu as she opened one of her dimensional doors and stepped through.<p>"Well. I guess we can go now. Akane will be pretty upset if I'm late," said Ranma as he started walking.<p>"Um...right," said Ryoko nervously.<p>++++++++++<p>Akane frowned as she exited the dressing room that the school had prepared for the visiting team. Jadeite, Nephrite, Kunzite, and Zocite were all standing in front of her with smirks on their faces.<p>"Ack! What the heck are you doing here?" she cried in surprise.<p>"Well, we're here to keep an eye on things," said Jadeite as he stepped foreword and put his hand on her shoulder. "Plus, you didn't really think we'd miss this do you?"<p>Akane frowned as she looked around at the group for a moment. "Who's watching the headquarters?"<p>"The world can survive without us for a few hours," said Kunzite with a small snort. "We aren't going to miss this."<p>"Besides, you look good in a leotard," said Kunzite cheerfully.<p>Zocite promptly elbowed him in his ribs and frowned at him.<p>Akane sighed and hung her head. "Jerks."<p>"Akane Tendo," said a familiar voice.<p>"Oh no," muttered the girl weakly as she turned to see Tatewaki Kuno standing in the hallway.<p>The boy looked close to tears. "It is true, you are as beautiful as I imagined you to be in a leotard!"<p>She narrowed her eyes at him and growled. "What do you want?"<p>"It drives me to madness!" cried Kuno as he rushed foreword towards her. His charge was stopped cold as he found a rapier like blade pointed at his throat. "What is this? Who would dare keep me from my love?"<p>"You know this boy Akane?" said Jadeite coldly as he poked Kuno in his throat a little with the blade.<p>As tempting as it was, she nodded her head slowly. "I can handle this."<p>Jadeite smirked at her as the other men surrounded Kuno with dark looking smiles on their faces. "No need for that. You need to be ready for that match, let us deal with him for now."<p>Akane frowned, but nodded her head as she walked back to the changing room again.<p>"Honorless curs! How dare you keep her away from her true love! Fear not Akane Tendo! I shall be with you posthaste!"<p>Jadeite ignored the ranting and frowned at him. "Who are you? How do you know Akane Tendo?"<p>Kuno blinked as he realized that the men were all wearing black suit and tie uniforms that he recognized. "You are the security..." he mumbled dumbly.<p>"That's right," said Kunzite as he moved Jadeite aside gently. "Who are you?"<p>"I am Tatewaki Kuno! Undefeated Kendo Champion, and Blue Thunder of Furinkan High!" said the boy proudly. "I am also the most beloved secret desire of Akane Tendo. Let me pass, so that I might be with her at last. Surely she pines away, longing for my embrace!"<p>"She has to get ready for her match," said Kunzite calmly. "You can't see her at the moment. Leave, before we throw you out."<p>"I must give her these roses of affection and encouragement personally, and a warning," said Kuno as he held out a bouquet of red roses.<p>"A warning?" muttered Zocite as he frowned at the boy. "What warning?"<p>"My sister," said Kuno with a small frown as he glared at them. "She is dangerous. I have little doubt that she will try something...deceptive...in the match."<p>The former generals all looked at one another for a moment.<p>"We'll deliver your flowers, and your message," said Jadeite as he took the flowers from the boy's hand. "No visitors are allowed before the match."<p>"What? Surely you would allow me to..."<p>"No exceptions," said Jadeite as he glanced back over his shoulder to see his three companions barring the way.<p>++++++++++<p>"Is he gone?" muttered Akane as she opened the door to let Jadeite in.<p>"Yes," said the man with a small smirk. "He left fairly quietly once he realized we were security."<p>"Too bad," grumbled Akane as she sat down in one of the chairs in the room.<p>"These came for you," said Jadeite as he held forth two bouquets of flowers, one red and one black. "One from the boy, the other a gift from your opponent."<p>"Black?" muttered Akane as she took them. "That seems like a threat."<p>"I wouldn't know," said Jadeite as he smirked at her.<p>"Yes you would, I've seen her file, and so have you," replied Akane as she looked at him. "She's been fairly quiet considering."<p>"You're right. I believe Ranma had a talk with her," said the man as he nodded.<p>"What?" gasped Akane angrily.<p>"Don't get upset, he'd never ask anyone to throw a fight. You should know that by now," said the man as he scowled at her.<p>Akane calmed visibly. "Still. I don't need his help."<p>"Perhaps not," agreed Jadeite calmly. "Kodachi Kuno isn't above assassination. If she had trouble eliminating you that way, it is very possible she would have found a more permanent way of dealing with you."<p>Akane stared at him. "What?"<p>"Don't look at me that way. It's true she's never done it before now, but I've known enough assassins in my time to know the type. It wouldn't take much to send her down that path."<p>"How many assassins could you have known?" snorted Akane in disbelief.<p>"I had several hundred working for me at one point," said Jadeite calmly. "They make good spies, among other things."<p>Akane turned away from him. "I still don't know how Ranma met all of you. He's never said anything."<p>Jadeite smirked at her for a moment. "It's fairly simple really. We used to work together, under the rule of Queen Serenity in the Silver Millenium, some ten thousand years ago. All of us were quite close, brothers almost."<p>"That past life thing I've heard you mention before?" said Akane with a slightly understanding in her voice.<p>"Yes. Although, Genaku, or Ranma as you know him, was the only one of us who was actually reborn. The rest of us were slaves under the rule of Queen Beryl." Jadeite growled at this and stared at his fist for a moment. "He found a way to free us, and now she's got some new help."<p>"Those Youma Lords?" said Akane as things started to fall in place.<p>Jadeite nodded silently. He turned towards the door too leave her alone and paused, turning for a moment. "Don't go out there with such heavy things on your mind. It's better to think of things like this later."<p>"Right," said the girl as she looked at the roses in her arms. A hand reached down and grabbed them, pulling them out of her arms forcefully. "EEEK!"<p>The door burst open and Kunzite rushed in with Zocite. Jadeite was right behind them with Nephrite moving in behind him.<p>"I thought I taught you idiots about rushing into a room all at once," said Ranma as he glared at them for a moment. "You're easy targets, especially for a trap like this one."<p>He tossed the roses at their feet and they exploded in a cloud of gas. The four men backed into the hallway, coughing violently and slowly falling to the ground.<p>Akane stood watching the scene in shock. Ranma was holding up his palm and creating just enough wind to keep the gas on the opposite side of the room.<p>"What? What was that?" muttered Akane as she looked at the fallen men for a moment.<p>"Just some sleeping gas, Kodachi put it into those flowers," said Ranma with a smirk on his face.<p>"What's that smell?" asked Chibi-Usa as she strolled into the room with a bag hanging from her shoulder. "I got em Pop."<p>"Good, toss them in the corner," said Ranma as he glanced at her for a moment.<p>Akane smacked him across his face.<p>"Ouch! What the hell did you do that for?" he cried as he looked at her dumbly.<p>"You pervert! I could have been getting changed!" she snapped.<p>"So?" he said with a flat stare.<p>Akane hit him over the head with one of the chairs in the room. "Pervert!"<p>"This is why I didn't want to marry you. What's the big deal? There's nothing you've got that I don't have," said Ranma as he removed some of the broken pieces of chair from his hair.<p>"Huh?" snapped Akane, her face softened, and then turned into anger again. "What do you mean? I'm not good enough for you?"<p>"Don't put words in my mouth, and stop hitting me," he replied flatly as he caught her punch casually. "You've got a fight coming up."<p>Akane growled and turned away from him. "I was starting to think you weren't going to show up."<p>"Yeah Pop, I've been following that Kodachi chick around like ya told me. She's boring!" snapped Chibi-Usa.<p>"Whatever," grumbled Ranma as he started to root through the gym bag that the girl had brought with her.<p>"What is that?" asked Akane as she peered over his shoulder.<p>"Kodachi's supply bag," said Ranma as he tossed a spare leotard over his shoulder.<p>"You...you...you..." Akane was practically shaking.<p>Ranma smacked her lightly on the cheek and smiled at her. "Get your mind out of the gutter." He pulled out a pair of gymnastics clubs and flipped the hidden switch on the side. Spikes shot out from the top of the club and Akane gasped and staggered back. "She was going to use these in that match. I took her bag, and replaced it with one with normal tools inside it just like yours."<p>Akane nodded and frowned. "She was going to cheat."<p>"Yup," snorted Ranma casually. "I think I'll hide these inside the Kuno mansion, Tatewaki's room would seem like a good place."<p>"What?" said Akane as she turned to look at him again.<p>"I can't just leave them here. What if someone stumbles across her bag in your room?" said Ranma calmly. "I won't be gone long. Chibi-Usa, Watch your older sister, I don't want her sneaking off to avoid training later."<p>"Ryoko?" said Chibi-Usa as she blinked and looked around. "Where is my big sister anyway?" She turned to look at Ranma, but he was already gone. "Damn."<p>+++++++++++<p>Ryoko wandered through the crowd and frowned as she found a vendor at last. It was a small booth in the back of the auditorium. Unfortunately, he was only selling soda. "Damn. What's a girl got to do to find some sake around here?"<p>The vendor looked at her and blinked. "This is a high school. We can't sell alcohol here."<p>"What? No alcohol?" said the woman in horror. She scowled angrily and turned away. "That's it, I'm out of here."<p>"Where do you think you're going?" said Chibi-Usa as she frowned at her older sister.<p>"Hey kid, I'm goin to find a drink," said Ryoko cheerfully.<p>"Pop said to keep you here, so you're not goin anywhere!" said the little girl as she smirked at the woman.<p>"Ha! Like hell!" snorted Ryoko as she walked by the child. She paused though when she felt the energy in the room start to rise. "Damn. That transformation!" She slowly turned to see Chibi-Usa hadn't yet attempted it, but she was ready at a moment's notice.<p>"You know, I can stop you," said the little girl as she frowned at her.<p>"You and that damned transformation, you wouldn't stand a chance against me if not for that!" snapped Ryoko as she glared at the little girl.<p>Chibi-Usa smiled. "Wanna find out?"<p>"Huh?" said Ryoko dumbly.<p>"There's a ring right there," said Chibi-Usa. "No powers, how bout it? If you want, we won't even fly."<p>Ryoko grinned and cracked her knuckles. "You got a deal."<p>"Come on then," said the little girl as she strolled down towards the ring.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ryoko and Chibi-Usa stood in the middle of the ring. Murmurs of confusion moved through the crowd as they looked on in confusion.<p>Several of the men standing around the ring began to howl angrily at them.<p>"Get out of here!" cried the student referee as she walked up to them. "You can't use this ring!"<p>"Get lost," snorted Ryoko as she shoved the girl and sent her into the ropes. "I won't say it again. Me and the kid have something to settle."<p>"I'd listen to her if I were you," commented Chibi-Usa coldly. "Ready?"<p>"Anytime brat," snorted Ryoko.<p>Chibi-Usa took up a stance after giving a short quick bow. Ryoko did the same, she suddenly realized that she was about to beat up a little girl in front of a large crowd of people. If Tenchi ever heard about this... "Hey. Wait a minute, we can't do this here!"<p>"Too late to back out now!" cried Chibi-Usa as she jumped into the air and kicked Ryoko dead in her face.<p>"Ouch! You little brat!" cried the woman angrily.<p>"Ha! You're too slow and old!" snapped the little girl as she landed lightly in front of her opponent. "Come on!" She moved her arms quickly, in a complicated pattern of blocks and strikes. Finally she settled back and extended one of her arms forward with the other held behind her head.<p>"I'm gonna kick your ass for that kid!" snapped Ryoko as she charged forward and began to punch at the little girl. She halfway expected the girl to run and dodge, but instead Chibi-Usa stood her ground and blocked every strike.<p>"You couldn't kick my ass if I let you!" snapped Chibi-Usa as she lashed out and punched Ryoko in her stomach. The woman was bent forward violently and a spray of spit escaped her mouth as she lost her breath. The little girl wasn't finished yet though, she flipped up sideways, lashing out in a curving kick that twisted her completely around in the air and smashed into Ryoko's jaw.<p>"Damn! She's so strong!" growled Ryoko as she staggered back and closed her eyes from the force of the blow. "How can a kid like that be so..."<p>"You old bat. You're thinking I'm some little girl aren't you? I'm not a little girl, I'm a little Saiyan. That's more than enough to kick your sorry, flabby butt!"<p>"Hey! My butt is not flabby!" snapped Ryoko. "I'll have you know I'm the best looking woman you'll ever lay eyes on!"<p>"Being pretty doesn't say anything for your fighting skills. I'm cuter than you, and stronger!" cried Chibi-Usa triumphantly as she made a victory sign with her fingers and posed proudly.<p>"Wow! That's my girl!" cried Usagi as she jumped up and down excitedly on the ringside. Ranma was beside her with a scowl on his face.<p>Chibi-Usa paused and looked at her. "Mom? What the heck are you doing here?"<p>Ryoko smirked. "I've got you!"<p>"Huh?" muttered the little girl as she turned and saw a fist connect with her face. She skid across the canvas on her rear, clutching her nose painfully.<p>"Oub! By doze!"<p>"Ha!" snapped Ryoko as she rushed foreword and kicked the girl in her gut.<p>"Dat hurbs do old bad!" snapped Chibi-Usa as she released her bleeding nose and grabbed the woman's leg after she had been kicked in the gut. She tackled Ryoko to the ground, forcing her onto her back.<p>"Ouch! What the heck are you doing you little brat!" cried Ryoko angrily.<p>The child jumped up onto her chest, straddling her just in front of her breasts. "I hab oo!"<p>Ryoko's eyes went wide as she realized that the brat had her arms pinned down. There was nothing she could do as she was beaten in her face repeatedly.<p>Chibi-Usa paused and glared at her. "Gib ub det?"<p>Ryoko glared at her. "Never!" She reached up with her legs and grabbed the little girl around her head with her thighs.<p>"Ub-oh," muttered the girl as she realized what had happened.<p>Ryoko promptly slammed her headfirst into the canvas.<p>"No! Stop that!" cried Usagi. Ranma was holding her back forcibly, preventing her from rushing into the ring.<p>"Let it be," he said firmly.<p>"How can you say that?" gasped Usagi. "That woman is..."<p>"Chibi-Usa is taking it easy on her," said Ranma flatly. "Her older sister won't hurt her."<p>"Older sister?" said Usagi dumbly as she looked up at Ryoko.<p>"You mean...?"<p>"No, she's not yours," said Ranma calmly.<p>"You cheated on me!" cried Usagi as she hit him over the head with a nearby folding chair.<p>"We aren't seeing each other," said Ranma as he glared at her. "I can't cheat on you, if we aren't dating."<p>"But...she's from the future too right?" muttered the blonde as she stared up at Ryoko uncomfortably.<p>"No. Ryoko is from the past," said Ranma. "She's the child of myself and Washuu."<p>"You mean, you and that redhead...?" said Usagi as she looked at him.<p>"Actually, I think Ryoko is more of a clone than an actual child. She just used both of our DNA to make her as I recall."<p>Usagi looked very relieved.<p>Ranma was sweating bullets, praying she wouldn't think of asking how she got his DNA in the first place. Those chairs really hurt.<p>About this point, Ryoko was laid out across the mat as Chibi-Usa nailed her in the jaw with another jumping kick. She struggled to get up, but failed and slumped against the mat on her back.<p>"Damn!" growled Ryoko as she saw Chibi-Usa descending from above.<p>"That's enough!" cried Ranma as he appeared in her line of sight and grabbed the smaller girl from her decent effortlessly, snagging the back of her shirt.<p>"Hey!" cried Chibi-Usa as she glared at him.<p>"You've won," said Ranma as he set her down and offered his hand to Ryoko.<p>She took it and was painfully pulled back to her feet. "Damn...have I really gotten that weak?"<p>"Weak! I oughta..." snarled Chibi-Usa angrily.<p>The crowd was going nuts, cheering as the match ended. Ranma looked around and smirked. "Well, that's enough you two. I have no idea what possessed you to do this though."<p>"You told me to keep her here," replied Chibi-Usa with a shrug.<p>"It would have been easier if you had transformed," snorted Ranma.<p>"This was more fun," said the girl as she looked up at him and grinned, a steady stream of blood running down the bottom of her mouth.<p>"Eek! You're bleeding!" cried Usagi as she pulled the girl aside and practically shoved a handkerchief up her nose.<p>"Aw mom, it's no big deal! It doesn't even hurt!" said Chibi-Usa with a frown on her face as she allowed the woman to force her head back.<p>"Well you're getting your clothes all dirty!" snapped the blonde.<p>"Oh," said the little girl with a small sigh.<p>"She's pretty strong," said Ryoko as she looked down at the pair.<p>Usagi gave her a dirty look and turned back to her child again. She frowned at the little girl and got a weary look in her eyes. "This is my child?" she muttered to herself sadly. She wiped the child's face with a clean portion of the handkerchief. The bleeding had stopped easily enough, and she looked very cheerful, despite the bruises that marred her face.<p>"Hey! Quit scratchin my face with that thing!" sputtered the little girl in embarrassment.<p>Usagi looked up at Ranma and then back to her. "No. You're his child."<p>"Hey! What the heck are you talkin about!" snapped Ranma as he looked down at the blonde in confusion. "You ain't dumpin her off on me!"<p>"She already did," said Chibi-Usa as she stuck her tongue out at him.<p>"Stop it both of you!" snapped Usagi. "I won't have you acting like this! Look at her! She looks terrible!" She shoved the girl towards Ranma gently.<p>"She's all right," said Ranma as he looked at her and smirked.<p>"All right! She's got a black eye!" snapped Usagi.<p>"You call that a black eye? I had worse than that," snorted Ranma. "She's fine, bruises and such are a part of being a martial artist."<p>Usagi slapped him again.<p>"Hey! Quit it! She's not hurt!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Wow. I've never seen them fight like this before," said Chibi-Usa in a sort of horrified wonder.<p>"Huh?" said Ryoko as he looked down at the girl.<p>"Come on, stop it!" said the little girl as she stood between them. "You two never act this way!"<p>Ranma was giving Usagi a rather lazy stare. "Sure, whatever."<p>"I'm sorry," muttered Usagi as she looked down at the girl. "It's just that..."<p>"I know what it is, you feel sorry for her," snorted Ranma as he looked away from her purposefully.<p>"That's right. How could we allow her to live this way?" said Usagi quietly. "Is the future so bad that I have to have a daughter like this one?"<p>"Hey! Getting stronger doesn't always feel good, but I've never been sorry I did it!" snapped Chibi-Usa angrily as she glared at her mother angrily.<p>"What?" said the blonde dumbly.<p>"She doesn't want your pity, and she doesn't need it," said Ranma as he glanced back over his shoulder at her before walking away.<p>"But..." stammered Usagi.<p>"There's no trouble in the future," said Chibi-Usa cheerfully. "If there was, me and Pop would go destroy it for sure!" The little girl flexed her arm and grinned proudly.<p>"I see," said Usagi as she looked down at her and sighed.<p>The lights went out in the auditorium as the events began.<p>++++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo stepped out into the arena, glancing passively back and forth across the crowd as she strolled through the students as she made her way towards the ring. The four former generals stood around her and escorted her to her place.<p>She saw Ranma sitting at the ringside, he nodded to her and she jumped up into the ring, landing on the mat lightly with her hands in the air.<p>The referee introduced her to the crowd as this happened and a spotlight appeared on her from above. "From Furinkan High School! Akane Tendo!"<p>+++++++++++<p>Kodachi glared foreword angrily as she prepared to make her entrance. "When I discover who misplaced my bag, I shall destroy them!" she snarled angrily as she sat on the platform that would lower her into the ring from above. "Do you have the bomb ready?" she snapped as she stared at the girl who was responsible for the pyrotechnics of her entrance.<p>"There won't be one," said Jadeite as he waved at her with his hand on the girl's shoulder. "You're going to play fairly like we suggested. Need I remind you exactly what is riding on this match for you? You don't even have to win to stay ahead."<p>Kodachi stared at him, hatred filling her soul as she growled angrily.<p>"Behave yourself. Your feeble attempts at cheating despite our warnings are wearing his patience thin."<p>"Cheating?" snapped Kodachi. "I was merely fighting in all fairness, before the match!"<p>"Fighting in all fairness before the match, is against the rules Kodachi Kuno," said Jadeite calmly.<p>"What?" snapped Kodach indignantly. "There is no mention of this in the rules!"<p>"We could take this up with the panel of judges below if you would like it," said Jadeite with a cold looking smile.<p>Kodachi opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off as the man nodded towards the crowd below.<p>"You're on."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo stared at the girl who landed in front of him and scowled. "Ah, you must be Kodachi."<p>"Indeed, and you are Akane Tendo?" said the girl hautily.<p>"You're about to find out what it's like to fight a real martial artist," said Akane.<p>"Tacchi?" said Kodachi in confusion.<p>"No! Me damn it!" snapped Akane as she jerked her thumb at herself.<p>"How quaint," said the girl lazily as she twirled her ribbon skillfully in the air.<p>Akane grabbed hers and actually managed to spin her ribbon in a square pattern in the air. Unfortunately, she was trying to move it in a circle. "Stupid thing!" growled Akane.<p>Kodachi smirked. "Most impressive. It seems you have more skill than I've given you credit for!"<p>Akane blinked and snapped her wrist, snapping the ribbon at Kodachi like a whip.<p>"Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho!" laughed Kodachi as she blocked it by creating a spiral pattern in front of her, thus shielding the attack effectively. "Good, but not good enough!"<p>Akane snapped her ribbon back and tossed it over the edge of the ring. Kodachi blinked in surprise at the act, but jumped in shock when a small rubber ball rolled up from behind Akane. The girl snapped her leg back and kicked it like a soccer ball, knocking Kodachi's ribbon away and over the edge of the ring as well.<p>"Got ya!" cried Akane with a smug looking smirk.<p>"You'll pay for that!" snarled Kodachi as she took two clubs from her corner and prepared herself.<p>Akane took the rope and twirled it around her body skillfully for a moment. She paused as she grabbed the rope with her foot and stopped its momentum. "Come on!"<p>++++++++++++<p>"What's going on?" asked Usagi as she looked at Ranma in confusion. Ryoko and Chibi-Usa were sitting beside him in folding chairs just beside the ring.<p>"They both suck, that's what's happening," replied Ranma with a sour frown.<p>"Huh?" said Chibi-Usa dumbly. "I thought this chick was supposed to be some kind of champion!"<p>"She is, but she's cheated for so long, that she's forgotten how to use the real techniques," replied Ranma with a shrug.<p>+++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo growled, her arms tied to her sides with the rope she had once hoped to use as a weapon. Now she merely kicked a small rubber ball into her opponent's face repeatedly, doing nothing more than irritating her.<p>"Stop that you trollop!" snapped Kodachi angrily as she jabbed at Akane with one of the clubs again. She had no idea why the technique wasn't working, it always worked when you stabbed your opponents with the spiked clubs!<p>"I'll kill you!" snapped Akane as she kicked the ball into the girl's face again.<p>"Take this then! Razor Hoop!" called Kodachi as she threw a hoola-hoop at the girl, and beaned her in the forehead with it.<p>"Ouch!" snapped Akane as she crossed her eyes. Her arms were unable to rub the sore spot on her forehead because of the rope that tied them there. "Damn you!"<p>"Curses!" snapped Kodachi as she resorted to her own rubber ball.<p>The scene that followed was comical at best. Akane struggling to untangle herself from her rope, while kicking her ball into Kodachi's head and catching it when it came back with her stomach and legs like some sort of soccer practice dummy.<p>The two of them were standing in the middle of the ring, kicking their balls into each other's faces.<p>The entire auditorium was completely silent, unable to speak from sheer shock.<p>Finally, after about three minutes, Akane ducked away from Kodachi's ball, and grabbed one of her clubs with her foot.<p>Kodachi backed away, blocking the strike with her own club. The pair spun around and spun their weapons in a wide arc, locking them together.<p>"You can't run from me Kodachi!" snarled Akane.<p>"I don't need to run!" snapped the girl in retort.<p>They broke apart and Kodachi was sent staggering back to the edge of the arena.<p>With a fierce battle cry, Akane slammed the weapon into Kodachi's gut, breaking the ropes and sending her flying out of the ring.<p>"Fool! A ring out is an impossibility for me!" snapped Kodachi as she pulled out a whistle and blew it loudly.<p>Akane felt the ring shudder as if trying to move, but then jumped in shock as a crackling sound followed by painful girlish screaming sounded from somewhere below her. "What's that smell?" she muttered as she realized that she smelled...pork?<p>Ranma calmly lowered the remote in his hand as Kodachi landed at his feet. "Ouch. I bet that hurt."<p>"What happened?" muttered Kodachi dumbly.<p>"You lost," said Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"Impossible! What happened to..."<p>Ranma walked over and lifted the skirt that covered the edge of the ring. He then held up the remote and showed her the entire gymnastics team from her school smoking painfully under the mat. Electrocuted by the copper wire that was strung across all the handholds they could have used to move the ring. "I told you about cheating. Oh well. You lost, I suppose I can let you off." He shrugged and turned towards Akane. "Good job."<p>She smirked at him and laughed. "I did it."<p>"Right," he said cheerfully.<p>The crowd was cheering excitedly at the upset.<p>Near the back of the room, Tatewaki Kuno stood up and nodded his head. "So. It appears Akane Tendo has more skill than I had once thought. She defeated even the deception of my sister."<p>++++++++++++<p>"So, that girl did pretty well," said Ryoko with a short nod as she looked up at the sky.<p>Ranma nodded and muttered to himself as he walked through the streets with his two daughters.<p>"Where the heck are we going anyway? This isn't the way back to the shrine," said Ryoko as she glanced around.<p>"This is the way to Hotaru's house," said Chibi-Usa cheerfully.<p>"Huh? That chick we met the other day? When those aliens showed up?" said Ryoko in confusion.<p>"That's right," confirmed Ranma.<p>"Why the heck would we be going there?" said Ryoko dumbly. She paused and hung her head. "Oh no."<p>Hotaru rounded the corner and met them. "So, you're here."<p>"Hiya," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Can she transform yet?" asked the little girl as she eyed Ryoko for a moment.<p>"Naw, still having trouble," said Ranma as he looked at her.<p>"Isn't one fight enough?" whined Ryoko.<p>"Too bad, this wouldn't hurt her as much if she learned how," commented Hotaru as the aura of energy surrounded her body.<p>"That's what I keep telling her," said Ranma with a shrug.<p>++++++++++++<p>Urd stood upright and stared up into the sky for a moment. "You feel that?" she asked.<p>Belldandy walked up beside her, laundry still hanging from her arms as she moved away from the clothesline. "It's them again."<p>"All of them together this time," said Urd with a short nod of agreement.<p>"What should we do?" asked Belldandy.<p>"What choice do we have?" asked Urd as she turned and looked at her sister with a frown on her face.<p>"Right," said Belldandy with a heavy sigh.<p>Both of them moved towards the home, Belldandy going to one of the mirrors, and Urd moving towards the television.<p>++++++++++<p>Meanwhile...<p>"Such power!" said Beryl as she glared into her crystal ball, a cold smile on her lips as she eyed the golden haired warrior within the mist inside. "Soon, he'll be mine...forever!"<p>++++++++++++<p>Tatewaki Kuno stood in the middle of his room, deep in meditation. He frowned at his discomfort, unable to understand why he felt this way.<p>"What is this feeling that wells up in my neither regions?" he muttered to himself. He stood and the pain left him. "Most unusual." He paused and looked down at his futon, his brow furrowing in confusion.<p>There was a confusing looking lump in the middle of the mat where he had been sitting.<p>"Perhaps this is the source of my discomfort?" He lifted the sheet up and blinked when he saw a duffel bag in the middle of his sleeping mat. He lifted it up and inspected its contents. "What are these strange devices? I have seen them before!"<p>He paused and realized that someone else was in his room.<p>"So, dear brother. It seems you have betrayed me," said Kodachi as she eyed him coldly as she walked through his door.<p>Tatewaki simply looked up at her and blinked. "Huh?"<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: The Evil Ranma!<p>
