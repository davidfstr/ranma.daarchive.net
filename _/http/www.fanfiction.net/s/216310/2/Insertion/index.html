</div>Insertion<p>Part 2<p>The Fiancee Factor.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma sat with his father and the Tendos in his male form several<br/>minutes later. All the girls were looking at him oddly, and a silence<br/>hung in the air around them. Ranma didn't notice, as he was busy with<br/>a conversation inside his own head.<p>"Okay, one of these girls is going to be our fiancee for a while<br/>at least. We need to decide which one it's going to be," said Carrot.<p>"What? I ain't going to marry no stupid girls!" snapped Ranma<br/>angrily.<p>"What were you planning on marrying then?" muttered Dan with a<br/>small frown.<p>"Right, now that it's settled. Who do we pick?" agreed Carrot.<p>"I ain't pickin nobody!" snapped Ranma in retort. "And that ain't<br/>what I meant and you know it!"<p>"Whatever," snorted Dan irritably. "Can we just get this over<br/>with?"<p>"Okay, I say we pick Nabiki," said Carrot.<p>"Huh? No way!" snapped Ranma.<p>"You be quiet unless you've got something useful to say," replied<br/>Dan.<p>"You won't be happy no matter what we say, and he's right, we have<br/>to pick somebody. Regardless of whether we intend to marry them. I for<br/>one don't want to get stuck with Akane," said Carrot in agreement.<p>"I don't have ta do nuthin!" snapped Ranma indignantly.<p>"Right, we'll just do it for ya," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>Ranma growled, and considered punching himself in the face for a<br/>moment to teach them both a lesson. He then remembered that he was<br/>surrounded by other people, and managed to control himself.<p>"Why Nabiki?" asked Dan.<p>"Come on. Akane's going to beat the crap out of us and get in our<br/>way," said Carrot with another frown.<p>"What's wrong with Akane? She seems nice enough," said Ranma, then<br/>he remembered something else the voice had mentioned. "Hey! I can take<br/>that slow chick anytime!"<p>"You'll find out what's wrong with her soon enough," said Dan with<br/>a small chuckle.<p>"Anyway, Nabiki's got a better body. I mean look at those things,<br/>Akane can't compare!" said Carrot sagely.<p>"Kasumi is older, and more developed," pointed out Dan.<p>"Yeah, but Nabiki is more likely to put out," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Hey! What's that supposed to mean?" snapped Ranma in shock.<p>"If you have to ask, you'll never know," deadpanned Carrot.<p>"I like having money to spare," countered Dan. "Kasumi is more<br/>likely to leave us alone."<p>"Yeah, but we get sent to Tofu's a lot in the beginning. I'd<br/>rather not get on his bad side," said Carrot with a little thought.<p>"Good point," agreed Dan. "I don't intend to ever set foot in the<br/>place if I can help it though."<p>"Wanna take that chance?" countered Carrot.<p>"Not really, no," said Dan with a small sigh.<p>"What the hell are you two talking about?" snapped Ranma<br/>irritably. "What's going on?"<p>"We're deciding our future," replied Carrot as if the boy should<br/>already know.<p>"What? Hey! This is my life you jerks!"<p>"And ours," pointed out Dan.<p>"That ain't my fault! You two can't just decide stuff for me!"<br/>snapped Ranma angrily.<p>"Hey, we're stuck here. We aren't deciding for you, we're deciding<br/>for us," said Carrot calmly.<p>"It's my body!" snarled Ranma.<p>"And you've been outvoted," said Dan.<p>+++++++++<p>"Mr. Saotome, why is Ranma choking himself?" said Kasumi sweetly<br/>as she interrupted the man's explanation.<p>"Huh? Oh that. It's nothing to worry about," said the man<br/>cheerfully.<p>The other Tendo's simply watched in shocked silence as Ranma<br/>rolled around on the ground, punching and kicking himself as hard as<br/>he could. He even blocked several strikes to his own groin during the<br/>battle.<p>Not caring about the odd connection this boy had with the redhead<br/>they had seen earlier that hadn't been explained yet. Nabiki quickly<br/>rushed to Akane's side. "Oh, he want's Akane."<p>"Definitely," agreed Kasumi.<p>"What? Why would he?" stammered the girl in shock as she looked at<br/>the boy in horror.<p>"Well, you are the cute one sis!" said Nabiki.<p>"Oh yes, all the boys at school like you. I'm sure he'll pick you<br/>anyway. We're just too plain looking!" agreed Kasumi.<p>Nabiki growled and flashed a quick glance at her sister, but did<br/>not argue.<p>"Hey! That's right! He must be a pervert! Just like all the<br/>others!" said Akane with a snarl as she began to apply pressure to her<br/>grip on the table, cracking the area around her fingers.<p>By this time, Ranma had himself pinned up against the wall and was<br/>trying to pull his own hand away from his throat. Soun stood up next<br/>to the boy and pat him on the shoulder, ignoring the strangeness of<br/>the situation for a moment.<p>"Well, congratulations son! Meet your new fiancee!" said the man<br/>as he waved his arm towards Akane.<p>"Huh?" muttered the boy as he looked at her blankly. "Hey! I<br/>didn't pick nobody!"<p>"Too bad, you should have been quicker," said Nabiki as she<br/>wandered away.<p>"Oh my! I have to start dinner!" gasped Kasumi as she also left<br/>the scene very quickly.<p>"Damn! This is all your fault, Ranma!" muttered Ranma under his<br/>breath quietly. No one seemed to notice this, and he sat back down.<p>"Well, now that we have this settled. Perhaps we should explain<br/>this to Akane now, Saotome?"<p>"Right," muttered Genma as he pushed his glasses up his nose.<p>"What's to explain? I'm not marrying him!" snapped Akane as she<br/>crossed her arms and turned away from them.<p>"Fine by me," muttered Ranma as he scratched his ear absently. His<br/>interest in the situation seemed to have vanished completely.<p>"They just need some time to get used to the idea," said Soun.<br/>"However, we never did get to tell them about the curse."<p>"It doesn't matter I suppose," said Genma with a small nod.<br/>"They'll find out sooner or later."<p>"Curse? What curse?" said Akane as she spun around and glared at<br/>them like they had suddenly sprouted palm trees from the top of their<br/>heads.<p>"Well, this curse," said Genma as he attempted to pick his son up<br/>and throw him over his shoulder, only to have the boy land in the yard<br/>just short of the koi. "Have you gained weight son?" he gasped as he<br/>looked at the boy for a moment.<p>"Hey! You callin me fat old man?" snapped Ranma as he succeeded in<br/>throwing his father into the koi, changing him into a panda.<p>"What the?" snapped Akane in shock. "You turn into a panda?"<p>"No, I don't. I turn into a girl," said Ranma as he sighed and sat<br/>down. "We've already met, Akane."<p>The girl blinked and stared at him for a moment.<br/>"You...you...you're that girl?"<p>"Yup! Ain't it cool!" said the boy cheerfully. His cocky grin<br/>changed to a rather innocent looking smile.<p>"That...you...you...YOU PERVERT!" she picked up the table and<br/>attempted to slam it down on top of him.<p>He nimbly jumped aside and looked at her in shock. "Hey! What the<br/>heck are you doin?"<p>"I can't believe you! You looked at my body you letch!" snarled<br/>the angry girl as she prepared to swing again. She blinked as he<br/>seemed to appear directly in front of her face, after vanishing from<br/>where he had been, and poked her nose lightly.<p>"Hey, you walked in on me lady," he replied.<p>"It's different when a girl sees a boy!" she retorted shakily as<br/>she jumped back, dropping the table in the process.<p>By this time, Soun and Genma were celebrating the union of the<br/>schools nearby. They each had a bottle of sake in their hands, and<br/>were waving around fans with tears of joy in their eyes.<p>"Not really. I tried to tell you earlier, but you just didn't get<br/>it," said the boy as he sat down. "Besides, what's the big deal?"<p>"What's the big deal! You pervert!" she snapped.<p>"Do you honestly think I get something out of that? I've got<br/>everything you've got," said Ranma calmly as he ignored her ranting.<br/>"Don't get mad at me because you screwed up lady. I told you I wasn't<br/>really a girl in the dojo, and I'm not the one who engaged us. This<br/>isn't my fault anymore than it is yours. I say, we take this out on<br/>the people who are really responsible."<p>Genma and Soun looked up from their drinking with complete shock<br/>on their faces.<p>Akane looked at the boy for a moment. He was glaring at his father<br/>with an odd smirk on his face, and cracking his knuckles absently.<p>"Now boy..." muttered Genma as he backed away.<p>"Come now Akane! You know I only want what's best for my little<br/>girl!" muttered Soun as he went completely pale; tears began to flow<br/>from his eyes as well.<p>Akane looked back and fourth from her father to Ranma. Unable to<br/>decide what to do. Finally, she picked up the table again, and turned<br/>towards Genma and Soun.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Well, that was fun!" said Carrot merrily as he sat down on the<br/>porch later that evening. Both of the parents were inside, nursing<br/>their injuries and lying on futons in their respective rooms.<p>"I agree," said Dan. He found himself wishing there were more<br/>explosions involved though. He really missed China.<p>"It wasn't that bad, at least after that Akane chick stopped<br/>trying to kill us," agreed Ranma with a small sigh.<p>"Don't worry Ranma, we're going to find a way out of this mess.<br/>There's lots of women much cuter than Akane in the world!" said<br/>Carrot.<p>"I've got an idea...it may help get Akane off our backs," said Dan<br/>with a small chuckle. "It's obvious she doesn't like boys, and has an<br/>ego bigger than the three of ours combined. She probably thinks we<br/>planned all this to get in her pants or something."<p>"Really?" said Ranma with a hopeful smile.<p>"Hey! You thought of something?" said Carrot in surprise.<p>"Shut up!" snapped Dan as he punched himself in the jaw.<p>"Ouch! I was just kiddin!" grumbled Carrot irritably as he rubbed<br/>at their face gingerly.<p>"Anyway, we'll tell Akane that there's someone else, and we can't<br/>marry her. That way, she'll pretty much leave us alone," said Dan.<p>"Is she about five seven, with long purple hair?" muttered Carrot<br/>cheerfully.<p>"I ain't marrying that psycho chick!" said Ranma in a panic.<p>"I like her, but I ain't marrying her. We've all seen how they<br/>treat men in that village, and I agree that it ain't for us," said Dan<br/>with a small frown.<p>"Ah ha! Ukyo! You're an Ukyo junkie!" said Carrot happily as he<br/>smacked is palm.<p>"Ucchan? You guys are sick! I knew it!" screamed Ranma in terror.<p>"We are not you dope! Ukyo Kuonji is a girl nimrod!" snapped<br/>Carrot.<p>"He ain't! I'd know if my best friend was a girl!" retorted Ranma.<p>"Carrot is right, Ukyo is a girl. She's a bit of a tomboy, but<br/>still a girl," said Dan calmly.<p>"It ain't true!" snapped Ranma indignantly.<p>"Look, if Ukyo is a boy, I promise we won't try anything. Okay?"<br/>said Carrot with a small sigh.<p>"Right! You're damn right you won't!" replied Ranma irritably.<p>"Still, the 'someone else' plan should work. Akane's anything but<br/>attached to us. We'll explain things to her tomorrow. I'm sure we can<br/>pull it off. Especially since Genma already spent the dowry," said<br/>Carrot cheerfully.<p>"Should be easy enough," agreed Dan.<p>"You promised!" warned Ranma.<p>"And we intend to keep our promise too," said Carrot with a sly<br/>grin forming on his face. He, of course, had no intentions of marrying<br/>Ukyo Kuonji, but it would make a good cover for a while with Akane;<br/>possibly curbing her insane jealousy a bit.<p>+++++++++<p>"Oh my! He's so animated," said Kasumi as she sat at the table and<br/>watched Ranma mutter to himself outside.<p>"What a weirdo," said Nabiki from beside her. "He just sits there,<br/>making faces."<p>"I guess he's the quiet contemplative type? He should be good for<br/>Akane," said Kasumi cheerfully.<p>"I think he's nuts, and we should get rid of him as fast as we<br/>can. Getting married to a loon is the last thing Akane needs."<p>"Nabiki! That's not very nice!" chastised Kasumi.<p>"It's true though, and we have to help her! For the good of the<br/>family, Kasumi!"<p>"I suppose you're right," said the older girl as Ranma began to<br/>laugh maniacally to himself. "But don't be to hard on him, Nabiki."<p>"Right, I'll only do what I have too," said the younger girl with<br/>a small sigh, as she hung her head guiltily. She hated it when Kasumi<br/>made her promise things like that too her. Still, she could work<br/>around it easily enough. After all, what would be 'enough' wasn't<br/>quite clear.<p>++++++++++++<p>"School?" asked Ranma as he sat with his father the next morning.<p>Genma sat across from Ranma with a huge black eye and his arm in a<br/>sling. "That's right boy. We are going to be staying a while."<p>"I guess it's been a while since I've been to school," said Ranma<br/>with a small shrug.<p>"It's the same school Akane and I go to! See you there!" said<br/>Nabiki cheerfully as she ran towards the door.<p>Akane stood up. "Hey! Wait up! I'll go with you!"<p>Nabiki paused and looked back at Ranma for a moment. "He can't do<br/>that much damage just walking to school, and Akane can take care of<br/>herself," she thought to herself. "Sorry, he's your fiancee, you<br/>should walk him to school."<p>Akane glared at the boy for a moment. He merely stood and walked<br/>past her towards the door.<p>"Well, are you coming?" he said without looking back at her.<p>Akane held her breath for a moment, puffing out her cheeks in<br/>frustration. "Jerk!"<p>+++++++++++<p>"When we get to school, we don't know each other!" said Akane<br/>angrily as she looked up at the boy walking along the fence lazily.<p>"When we get to school, I'm an old friend of your family, and<br/>nothing more," said Ranma as he looked down at her coolly.<p>"I don't want you following me around! Got it?" she snapped in<br/>retort.<p>"Hey! Why would I..." started Ranma, but his expression quickly<br/>changed again. "Look, we've got to talk, right now." He hopped down<br/>next to her and gently grabbed her wrist. The girl stopped and whirled<br/>around to glare at him. She paused and glanced over her shoulder as a<br/>splash of water hit the ground behind her. An old woman was emptying<br/>out her bath water from a pail, with a ladle.<p>"Don't touch me!" snapped the girl as she pulled her hand away.<p>"I've got no intention of marrying you, Akane. It isn't because<br/>you don't like me, or I just want to disobey my own father either,"<br/>said Ranma calmly as he leaned against the wall with a rather casual<br/>air about him.<p>"What are you talking about?" muttered Akane uncomfortably.<p>"There's someone else," said Ranma coolly.<p>"And you still came to my house and..." seethed Akane.<p>"Shut up and listen," said Ranma with a dead calm that bothered<br/>her slightly. Akane fell silent and looked at the ground for a moment.<p>"When I was six, my stupid old man engaged me to someone else. He<br/>took the dowry and ran off without her, never intending to honor the<br/>agreement in favor of this one. Ukyo was my best friend, and my dad<br/>thought that I thought she was a boy, and that I didn't know about the<br/>engagement." Ranma paused for a moment and looked at the girl in<br/>silence. Akane was simply glaring at him, not saying a word. "Now, our<br/>parents are going to try to make us do this no matter what, but Ukyo<br/>has lost her dowry already, my father wasted it. That makes her<br/>engagement more valid than this one as far as I'm concerned, no matter<br/>which one was first. So, you're going to calm the hell down, and stop<br/>being such a little bitch, right now."<p>"What?" snapped Akane in shock.<p>"I didn't ask to get dragged here you know. I like this less than<br/>you do, but if Pop finds out I know about this other engagement, he<br/>might do something stupid. So we're just going to keep our mouths<br/>shut, and play along. Got it?" said the boy as calmly as ever.<p>Akane growled and clenched her fists tightly and snorted in<br/>disgust at the boy in front of her. "Fine."<p>"Good," said Ranma cheerfully. "Let's go to school then!"<p>"You know, Pop was following us," said Ranma inside their head.<p>Carrot blinked and chuckled to himself. "So he was, I forgot."<p>"Did you?" said Dan with a wry smile crossing their face for a<br/>moment.<p>"That's a secret," said Carrot cheerfully. They continued to walk<br/>behind the strangely silent Akane, allowing her to lead them to the<br/>school.<p>++++++++++++<p>Genma frowned as he backed into the shadows again. "The boy<br/>knows!" The phrase worked over and over in his mind. "This isn't good,<br/>I've got to think of a way out of this. Ranma must marry Akane, he<br/>just has too! With the agreement with Soun, we'll get the dojo! The<br/>Saotome name cannot be soiled like this, there must be a way!" As he<br/>thought this to himself, he was absently rubbing the front of his neck<br/>nervously. "I'll deal with the boy later, when we're alone..." he<br/>decided after a moment.<p>++++++++++<p>"Hate boys! Hate boys! Hate boys! HATE BOYS!" screamed Akane as<br/>her morning tradition began.<p>Ranma blinked and started walking forward with his hands in his<br/>pockets lazily. "Oh yeah," he said out loud, as if he'd just<br/>remembered something. Akane met the hoards of boys attacking her and<br/>he followed just behind her, stepping over fallen bodies, and ducking<br/>under the occasional thrown ones.<p>Finally, they were all defeated leaving her and Ranma about<br/>halfway to the doors of the school. The ponytailed boy was standing in<br/>the middle of the one time crowd, and looking around idly. He didn't<br/>seem particularly concerned with this new development. Finally, he<br/>stepped forward, just in time to catch a flying rose from the air.<p>"What the?" he muttered in confusion. He turned and handed the<br/>rose to Akane. "Here, this is probably yours."<p>"You there! How dare you give a rose of love to Akane Tendo?"<br/>said a new voice from behind a nearby tree.<p>"What are you so worried about? It wasn't intended for me, and<br/>she's the only other person standing right now. At least, I hope it<br/>wasn't for me," said Ranma calmly as he turned to face the boy who had<br/>stepped from behind the trunk.<p>"True, it was intended for my love, the tigress Akane Tendo," said<br/>the boy with a frown as he glared at Ranma.<p>"Well, you should be more careful, that could have hurt someone<br/>the way you threw it," said Ranma as he started walking away.<p>"Fool! Did I give you my leave!" snapped Kuno as he stepped<br/>towards the strange boy.<p>"Did I ask permission to leave?" said Ranma coolly.<p>"It is obvious you do not know who it is that you are dealing<br/>with!" snapped Kuno arrogantly. "The sound of my voice..."<p>"Shut up. I know exactly who you are. You're the regional Kendo<br/>Champion, Tatewaki Kuno, the self proclaimed 'Shooting Star'. Don't<br/>speak to me like I'm your servant," Ranma continued to walk away,<br/>leaving Kuno with his mouth hanging open.<p>"That wasn't much fun Carrot," muttered Dan from inside the boy's<br/>head.<p>"Wait for it," said Carrot as he slowed their pace slightly.<p>"Hold," said Kuno as his jaw hardened. He looked towards Akane for<br/>a moment. "Forgive me my love, but we shall spar in but a moment. I<br/>must first lay this dog low. I must, in my wisdom, show him where his<br/>place upon these hallowed grounds is." Kuno raised his weapon and<br/>rushed towards Ranma, who was now standing still, and glancing over<br/>his shoulder with a smile on his face.<p>"How bad do we want to hurt him?" said Carrot as the boy<br/>approached.<p>"As much as we can, let's just kill him and be done with it,"<br/>snorted Dan.<p>"No! Just knock him out or something!" retorted Ranma.<p>"Cur! I shall smite thee for thy insolence!" roared Kuno as he<br/>swung the blade down.<p>Ranma merely struck out with his hand, catching Kuno in the<br/>throat. The kendoist stood still for a moment, with the blade halfway<br/>swung. He made a small gurgling noise and fell flat on his back,<br/>gasping for breath desperately.<p>"Damn it!" snapped Ranma irritably. "Why did you do that?"<p>"Hey, he had a weapon!" retorted Carrot. "I can't jump around like<br/>you can remember? We've only been training with you and your father<br/>for a couple of months!"<p>"You should have let me handle this then!" cried Ranma.<p>"There was no time for delegation," snorted Dan. "You're lucky it<br/>wasn't me, I would have used our grenade."<p>"That reminds me! Why are we still carrying that around? We don't<br/>even need it here!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Because I don't go anywhere without something on me. I can't<br/>openly carry a gun around in Japan, and this is easier to hide!"<br/>grumbled Dan.<p>"Calm down, both of you. You're ruining our dramatic exit," said<br/>Carrot as he turned them away from the fallen Kuno.<p>"Well, at least the day can't get any worse," muttered Ranma<br/>angrily.<p>"Heh, you ain't seen nothing yet," chuckled Carrot.<p>++++++++++++<p>Pluto frowned as she looked at the empty bottle on her table.<br/>She'd run out again. The pain in her head was throbbing, irritating<br/>her more and more with each passing moment.<p>"Damn, I've got to go," she grumbled as she stood up and grabbed a<br/>coat. "Damn prescription."<p>Unfortunately for Pluto, there were no pharmacies on the entire<br/>planet. Which meant that it's guardian had to go elsewhere to get her<br/>medications. "Back to Earth again," muttered the Senshi.<p>Luckily, Venus had been awakened now. She should be able to handle<br/>things for the moment without her, for a short time anyway. Setsuna<br/>smirked as she teleported away; she always did enjoy getting out a<br/>bit. Who knew, maybe this trip, something interesting would happen?<p>+++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>NEXT TIME: Hallway Horrors, Setsuna's pills, and "What the heck is<br/>Dragonball Z"?<p>
