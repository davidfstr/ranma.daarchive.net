</div>Insertion<p>Part 70<p>Vahn's Revenge, Final.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Pardon?" asked Yohiko as she sat with Xellos<br/>at the table and blinked.<p>"I said, Vahn is still alive, and he's causing<br/>trouble," replied the man simply.<p>The woman looked thoughtful for a moment and<br/>frowned. "Vahn?"<p>"Yes, I believe you blew him up," replied the<br/>mage casually. "During that party, with the<br/>terrorists?"<p>"Oh! Oh yeah," said the woman cheerfully.<br/>"Neat. I suppose he wants..."<p>"Yes, Revenge," replied Xellos with a slight<br/>frown. "A rather nasty character that one."<p>"Yeah, I didn't really meet him before. I<br/>believe it was a trap I set that got him."<p>"Something like that," said the mage with a<br/>small shrug. "He's the only one besides your<br/>friend Olif that survived."<p>"Hmmm. I guess so, but...I halfway expected to<br/>see Olif before that guy, he didn't have any arms<br/>or legs."<p>Xellos sighed and shook his head. "Olif is<br/>living rather quietly, cowering in the corner of<br/>his cell and muttering gibberish in a mental<br/>institution."<p>"Oh," said the woman as she sipped at the cup<br/>of tea that rested in her palms. "Well, I imagine<br/>I'll have to oblige him then."<p>"Quite," said Xellos calmly as he stared at<br/>her for a moment.<p>"Well, I suppose I should look for him tonight<br/>then," replied the woman with a small shrug.<p>"Well, it's Saturday, get some sleep first,"<br/>said the man cheerfully.<p>"Where is Usagi?" said the woman as she<br/>glanced around the room.<p>"She's over with Godai, participating in the<br/>meeting of tenants there."<p>"What for?"<p>"Mostly so they can grill her about who I am<br/>in relation to you," said the man with a smirk on<br/>his face.<p>"You mean they still haven't figured that<br/>out?" said the woman with a slightly surprised<br/>frown on her face.<p>"No," replied the man as he lifted the<br/>newspaper up and started reading.<p>"Boy, I'd think they'd have figured it out by<br/>now," said the woman with a small shrug.<p>"I'm good at keeping secrets," said the mage<br/>with a slightly evil smirk forming on his face.<p>"I suppose so," replied the woman. "Still,<br/>everyone else says they can see it in us. I don't<br/>get it myself, but..."<p>"Who knows?" replied Xellos with a small<br/>shrug.<p>Yohiko smirked as she picked up a letter that<br/>was sitting on the table. "Akane's getting married<br/>next month. She invited me and my family along.<br/>Want to go?"<p>"Why not?" replied the man with a small shrug.<p>"Behave yourself. I kinda like her, despite<br/>everything," replied the woman with a smirk on her<br/>face.<p>"Oh, very well then," muttered Xellos.<p>"I mean it. I know you."<p>"Right, right, I promise, Mazoku's honor," said<br/>the man with a slightly disgusted frown on his<br/>face.<p>"What honor?" said the woman with her smirk<br/>widening.<p>"Har, har," said Xellos.<p>++++++++++++<p>Usagi sat in the room with the others, only<br/>half-listening to the debate about whether her<br/>Uncle was Yohiko's lover or not. A few of the<br/>guesses were close, but they never quite got it<br/>right. A cousin was as close as they came.<p>She didn't particularly care. Her mind was<br/>working on a more serious dilemma. That thing she<br/>had fought two nights ago. Well, when she wasn't<br/>distracted by thoughts of what had happened<br/>afterwards.<p>A slight blush crossed the girl's face as she<br/>thought about it and she noticed everyone was<br/>staring at her.<p>"What?" said the girl in confusion.<p>"You mean...he's really that big?" said Akemi<br/>dumbly.<p>"That explains a lot," muttered Itchinose as<br/>her cigarette hung from her lip in what appeared<br/>to be awe.<p>"What are you talking about?" said the girl as<br/>she looked at them.<p>Yotsuya was standing in front of a chalkboard<br/>with a somewhat surprised looking frown on his<br/>face. "Indeed. It seems my calculations were<br/>correct."<p>The girl blanched when she saw that the words<br/>Xellos's Penis size were written on the board with<br/>a question mark behind it.<p>"So that's why she puts up with him,"<br/>commented Akemi.<p>"Nooooo!" cried Godai as he stood up and<br/>flopped to the ground in horror.<p>"When I asked you, I didn't think you knew,"<br/>commented Yotsuya.<p>"What? I wouldn't know that! I was thinking<br/>about something else! I wasn't even paying<br/>attention!" cried the girl in defense.<p>"She hides her shame so well," said Yotsuya.<p>"Musta seen him coming out of the bath or<br/>something," agreed Akemi.<p>"Even if I did! I wouldn't be looking at<br/>that!" snapped the girl. "Gross!"<p>"Your mother is not married. There is no shame<br/>in assessing an unattached man," said Yotsuya<br/>calmly.<p>"You jerks!" cried the girl.<p>"It isn't true!" muttered Godai pathetically.<p>Usagi stood up and crossed her arms over her<br/>chest. "I'm leaving! You can figure this out on<br/>your own!" She turned away and slammed the door<br/>behind her.<p>"Her embarrassment reveals the truth," said<br/>Yotsuya as he looked at the sobbing form of<br/>Yusaku.<p>Akemi had her arm around him and was<br/>comforting him as best she could. She also<br/>appeared to be enjoying it a little too much.<p>"Don't touch that!" cried the boy as he jumped<br/>up suddenly.<p>"Sorry," she said sheepishly as she wiggled<br/>her fingers and smirked.<p>"If I was single again," said Itchinose with a<br/>slightly wistful sigh.<p>"Stop saying things like that you perverts!"<br/>cried the boy in horror.<p>"Hey, it's not our fault you got cute all of a<br/>sudden," said Akemi as she blew a puff of smoke<br/>into the air.<p>Godai hung his head and sat down again to<br/>sulk. "Just, leave me alone."<p>++++++++++++<p>Usagi started to open her door and paused as<br/>the voice of Yohiko and her Uncle stopped her.<p>"Right, right, Mazoku's honor," said the man<br/>cheerfully.<p>"What honor?" replied her mother.<p>"Har, har," said her Uncle flatly.<p>"Mazoku?" muttered the girl under her breath<br/>with a slightly surprised frown. "What...some kind<br/>of monster?" She stepped back and sucked in a<br/>quick breath as her mother opened the door.<p>"Hello Usagi, I thought you were talking with<br/>the band of idiots today," said the woman<br/>cheerfully.<p>The girl paused. "I umm..."<p>Xellos sighed. "How much did you hear child?"<br/>he said with a weary looking frown on his face.<p>"Nothing! I didn't hear anything about a<br/>Mazoku!" cried the girl fearfully.<p>Yohiko blinked. "What?" She turned her head to<br/>look at Xellos for a moment and frowned. "Come on<br/>in, might as well get this over with."<p>The girl nervously complied, ready to jump<br/>away at a moment's notice.<p>"That's just a title dear," said Xellos.<p>"He's right," said Yohiko. "Xellos is..."<p>"I've already told her I'm a sorcerer,"<br/>supplied the man calmly. "It's no big deal."<p>Usagi relaxed. "So, that's some kind<br/>of...sorcerer thing?"<p>"Something like that," said Xellos with a<br/>small chuckle. "More like a school, it's closer to<br/>say you're born into it."<p>"So, mother is..."<p>"No dear," said the woman with a small sigh.<br/>It was true, she was as human as Usagi at the<br/>moment.<p>"Um, I'm not..."<p>"No," said Yohiko with a small chuckle. "Don't<br/>worry. It's part of the reason he's the way he<br/>is."<p>"Kind of hard to explain to someone who's not<br/>informed," said Xellos. "At least not without<br/>scaring the hell out of them," he thought<br/>privately.<p>"Oh," said the girl as she took it on face<br/>value. "Well, I guess so."<p>"Right dear, don't think too hard about it,"<br/>said Yohiko cheerfully.<p>+++++++++++<p>Usagi stood on the roof of her home and<br/>glanced around as she jumped down into the street,<br/>the transformation taking place as she landed. She<br/>smiled and dashed off into the darkness, not<br/>realizing that another figure did much the same<br/>thing on the other side of the home.<p>She didn't get very far before she paused and<br/>noticed someone waiting for her in the street.<p>"Ryoga?"<p>"Hello Sailor Moon," said the boy as he nodded<br/>at her.<p>"What are you doing here?" she asked in<br/>confusion.<p>The boy blushed, he'd been trying to find his<br/>way to the Tendo Dojo. He had to say goodbye to<br/>Akane at least. After the last meeting with Usagi,<br/>he realized that he would never be with his first<br/>love. So, he'd moved on. He hadn't yet told her<br/>about his family curse, and floundered over it for<br/>a moment. "I knew you'd be going out again, after<br/>that thing." He steeled himself as her expression<br/>told him he was right.<p>"I have too," she said as she turned her gaze<br/>away from him. "No one else is going to beat him."<p>"I'm going with you," said the boy as he<br/>started walking towards her.<p>She frowned at this. "It's dangerous."<p>"That's why I'm going," he replied calmly.<p>"I don't want you to get hurt," she insisted.<p>"And I don't want you to get hurt either, who<br/>knows what would have happened if I hadn't shown<br/>up when I did."<p>The girl nodded as she realized he wasn't<br/>going to leave her alone. "All right." A grin<br/>formed on her face as she grabbed his arm and<br/>started to pull him along. "We'll celebrate after<br/>we beat him!"<p>"What?" said the boy as his entire body turned<br/>beet red.<p>"It isn't at that mansion anymore," said the<br/>girl. "I went back a few days ago, but it was<br/>cleared out. Police were everywhere."<p>"I see," said Ryoga. "So where are we going?"<p>"Back to that mansion," said Usagi firmly.<p>"Huh? But you said..."<p>"They might have left a clue about where they<br/>went behind. I couldn't get in last time because<br/>of the police."<p>"Oh," said the boy dumbly.<p>++++++++++++<p>They arrived within an hour and stood staring<br/>at the doorway. There were no longer any police,<br/>but the scene was taped off. There were boards<br/>nailed up on the windows of the entrance, but the<br/>rest of the home was untouched.<p>The pair walked inside calmly. The door had<br/>been locked, but Usagi's costume was easily able<br/>to mimic the key by filling in the lock like a<br/>sort of liquid.<p>"So, what are we looking for?" asked Ryoga.<p>"Anything. Maybe we should split up?" said the<br/>girl as she glanced back at her companion.<p>"I don't think that would be a very good<br/>idea," said the boy nervously.<p>"You're not scared are you?" she quipped.<p>"No! But..."<p>"All right, you can stay with me then!" said<br/>the girl as she latched onto his arm.<p>"This isn't a date you know," he said weakly.<p>"Well, it's as close as we've come to one,"<br/>said the girl cheerfully as she pulled him into<br/>the middle of the lobby.<p>"How quaint," said a voice from the shadows.<br/>The lights came on and the pair stood there in<br/>shock. Usagi released Ryoga's arm and frowned at<br/>the figure that stood at the top of the stairs.<p>Tanaka smirked at the pair. He was wearing a<br/>long cape with armored shoulder pads over a light<br/>purple uniform. A broadsword hung at his side and<br/>his hair was now fluffed into a style that hung<br/>into his face from his bangs. "Welcome back. I<br/>suspected you might return here. The police<br/>presence kept me from setting my trap until now."<br/>He pointed at the girl and laughed.<p>"Um...are you wearing lipstick?" said Usagi as<br/>she seemed to peer at him for a moment.<p>"Why, yes," replied the man calmly. "I am<br/>wearing lipstick."<p>"Why?" muttered Ryoga in confusion.<p>"Because, I am an evil bishonen villain!"<p>"Oh," replied the pair.<p>"Vahn! Welcome our guests!" snarled the man as<br/>he drew his sword and pointed it at them<br/>dramatically. After a second or two, he let the<br/>tip touch the floor and gasped. "This thing is<br/>heavy!"<p>"It's that thing!" said Ryoga as the<br/>mechanical beast appeared in the room from the<br/>basement again.<p>"Ah, they have returned. I didn't come here to<br/>play your games Tanaka. I want the other one, not<br/>this puny being!"<p>Usagi blinked. "Other?"<p>"The Shadow," said the thing hatefully. "He is<br/>my true enemy, you are nothing to me, and I will<br/>destroy you to satisfy my obligation. I will have<br/>my real revenge soon enough!"<p>The girl's ribbons started to elongate from<br/>her back and float in the air again. "Ryoga, get<br/>out of the way, you won't do me any good out<br/>here."<p>"Right, I'll wait for an opportunity to<br/>strike," he said with frustration clear in his<br/>voice. "I shouldn't have come. I caught him by<br/>surprise before, I'll just get in the way against<br/>that thing!"<p>Usagi was already moving forward with grim<br/>determination in her eyes. "You're going down this<br/>time!"<p>"You cannot win," said the thing coldly as its<br/>claws began to work in anticipation.<p>Ryoga glanced down nervously as he started to<br/>walk towards the man standing at the top of the<br/>stairs. His gaze was cold, and Vahn ignored him.<p>"So, she sends her sidekick to die at my<br/>hands?" said Tanaka coldly.<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" snarled<br/>Ryoga as he clenched his fists at his side. "I'm<br/>not her sidekick!"<p>"No matter, we all know that only Sailor Moon<br/>has the power to vanquish me! Your attempts will<br/>be laughably pathetic!"<p>"Is that so?" snarled Ryoga as he stood off<br/>against the man.<p>"Yes, It's inevitable. If she manages to<br/>defeat Vahn, we will have a dramatic battle on the<br/>roof of this building. In the moonlight, we will<br/>face each other in honorable combat, with only one<br/>of us surviving."<p>"You read too much manga," said Ryoga coldly<br/>as he took up a combat stance.<p>"Martial arts?" said the man in amusement as<br/>he put his sword on his shoulder pad and chuckled.<br/>"You fool, I'm a bishonen villain. It's my very<br/>nature to be deceptive and cowardly."<p>"What?" said the boy in confusion.<p>"Lucky for me, it's an interpretive art form,"<br/>said the man as he took a handgun from his belt<br/>and promptly shot Ryoga.<p>The lost boy's eyes went wide, he had moved,<br/>but not soon enough. "I..." he said as he slumped<br/>down against the stair rail and clung to it for a<br/>moment. His left arm hung uselessly at his side.<br/>"You bastard. I'll."<p>"You'll die," said Tanaka coldly.<p>Usagi's attention had vanished from Vahn at<br/>the sound of the shot. She gasped in horror and<br/>looked up at the scene. "No! Ryoga!" she screamed<br/>angrily.<p>Vahn simply stood there for a moment, but<br/>started to move towards her to stop her.<p>Another voice entered the room and everyone<br/>went silent.<p>"Pathetic, you're nothing more than a<br/>charlatan," said an evilly smooth tone from one of<br/>the upstairs rooms as the door opened. "I'd like<br/>to see how you'll do against a real bishonen<br/>villain."<p>"What?" gasped Tanaka. He spun around and took<br/>a step back.<p>Jadeite was standing there with a rapier in<br/>his hand and a cool smile on his face. "I was<br/>going to just let this little drama play out, but<br/>you're a disgrace. I won't have you besmirching<br/>such a title with such a pathetic display."<p>Vahn stopped moving and spoke to Usagi. "We<br/>will not be interrupted. Your friend will live, if<br/>you manage to survive me again."<p>The girl glanced at Ryoga. He was on his feet,<br/>and didn't appear to be too badly hurt. He now had<br/>one of his bandannas tied to the wound on his<br/>shoulder and simply watched the pair in front of<br/>him.<p>The girl turned to face the cyborg and<br/>frowned.<p>++++++++++++<p>Tanaka snarled as he hefted his sword and<br/>pointed it at the man. "You say I'm not good<br/>enough to be a bishonen villain? How dare you!"<p>"You're too short," said the notably taller<br/>Jadeite calmly as he stepped forward.<p>"I'll kill you!" snarled the man as he charged<br/>and swung his sword clumsily.<p>Jadeite merely raised his hand and a pillar of<br/>dark magic engulfed the man.<p>A charred looking skeleton slumped onto the<br/>ground when the light faded. "Heh. Pathetic." He<br/>narrowed his eyes and turned towards Vahn. "Now,<br/>as for you..."<p>"My, it certainly is noisy in here tonight,"<br/>said a cold voice from the darkness. Everyone<br/>turned to see a tall dark blob of darkness walk<br/>through the front door of the home. the shadows<br/>melted away from the thing, revealing a tall man<br/>with a pair of handguns held at the ready. His<br/>eyes were amused more than anything else.<p>"You!" cried Vahn as he swat Usagi aside. The<br/>girl had a few tendrils of ribbon wrapped around<br/>him, but hadn't really started fighting yet.<p>The girl hit the wall roughly and rubbed at<br/>her head in irritation.<p>The Shadow paused and looked at the thing for<br/>a moment, not even bothering to take stock of the<br/>situation around him otherwise. "Vahn?"<p>"At last! I shall have my revenge!" roared the<br/>thing as it raised its claws into the air in<br/>triumph.<p>Everyone paused when The Shadow suddenly fell<br/>to his knees.<p>Vahn chuckled, his nemesis was paralyzed with<br/>fear, to shocked to fight. "I hope you'll give me<br/>a better fight than this."<p>The Shadow ignored him. "A...A...A Su...A<br/>Suuu...A Suup...A Super Villain?" He jumped up to<br/>his feet and raised his arms in triumph. "Thank<br/>you!"<p>Everyone simply stared at him for a moment.<p>"What?" said Usagi dumbly. "Hey! He's my Super<br/>villain!" cried the girl irritably. "I was just<br/>gonna kick his ass!"<p>The Shadow paused again, realizing that there<br/>were others in the room with him. "Wha?"<p>Usagi blinked as she fell under the<br/>intimidating figure's gaze. "USAGI? What the hell<br/>are you doing here?"<p>"Um...I know you?" said the girl in confusion.<p>"Oh, You are in so much trouble when you get<br/>home young lady!" said the Shadow as he rushed up<br/>to her and grabbed her ear, twisting it painfully.<p>"What? Let me go you freak! Wait! Home! You're<br/>going to tell my mother about this!"<p>"Your mother?" said the figure dumbly. "You'd<br/>better get your behind back home right now!" he<br/>snapped. "You and I are going to have a long<br/>discussion about this when I get back young lady!"<p>"What the hell? Who are you?" cried Usagi as<br/>she tried to escape the figure's grip on her ear.<br/>Tears of pain were starting to well up in her<br/>eyes.<p>"You let her go!" screamed Ryoga as he dove<br/>towards the figure in an offensive stance.<p>"Ryoga? What are you doing here?" cried The<br/>Shadow as he finally noticed the boy.<p>"Huh?" said the boy dumbly as he found himself<br/>grabbed by his ear. "You two are in on this<br/>together?"<p>"What?" said Usagi in shock.<p>"What kind of trouble have you been getting<br/>your cousin into mister?" snapped the angry man as<br/>he jerked Ryoga's head from side to side<br/>violently.<p>"Cousin?" said the pair in unison as they<br/>suddenly froze and looked at the man in shock.<p>Vahn wasn't sure what to do, he simply stared<br/>at the scene. "I...um..."<p>"Hold your horses! I'll get to you when I deal<br/>with this!" said the Shadow impatiently.<p>"But I..." said Usagi in horror. "He is not my<br/>cousin! He's my boyfriend!"<p>"Um! Yeah!" said the boy lamely.<p>"Usagi Hibiki, what the hell are you talking<br/>about?" snapped The Shadow.<p>Ryoga froze and looked at the girl. "Your name<br/>is Hibiki?" he muttered as he almost passed out.<p>"Um yeah...don't tell me..." said the girl<br/>quietly.<p>"Ryoga Hibiki," confirmed the boy. He seemed<br/>to be on the verge of tears.<p>"WAAAAAAHHHHHH! I'll never have sex again!"<br/>cried the girl as she burst into tears.<p>The Shadow froze and released both teens.<br/>"What?" Slowly, his head turned to look at the<br/>boy, a cold fire burning in the back of his eyes.<p>"She made me do it!" cried Ryoga in horror.<p>The Shadow growled, it was an inhuman sound.<br/>The two handguns appeared in his grip again and he<br/>leveled them on the unfortunate boy.<p>"Oh shit," said Ryoga lamely. He turned and<br/>started running.<p>The Shadow moved after him, firing shots that<br/>barely missed the boy. His skills clouded by an<br/>intense anger. "Die! Die! How dare you! My little<br/>girl! You perverted bastard! Just you wait until I<br/>get my hands on you!"<p>Vahn had yet to move. He simply watched the<br/>scene, unable to do anything. "What the hell is<br/>this?" he muttered to himself.<p>"Little bastard! I'll see how well you can get<br/>to know your cousin without it!"<p>"AAAAAAHHHHHHH!" cried Ryoga fearfully as he<br/>was chased back and fourth through the room.<p>Usagi chased after the man, her ribbons<br/>clinging to him desperately as she tried to stop<br/>him without much success. "No! Don't hurt him!"<p>Jadeite blinked and turned away, intent on<br/>leaving quietly.<p>A pair of bullet holes stopped his escape and<br/>he slowly turned around.<p>The shadow was glaring at him from below,<br/>pausing his chase of the lost boy for a moment.<br/>"Where the hell do you think you're going?"<p>"I was just leaving," said the man lamely.<p>"You stay put Nephrite! We're going to have a<br/>long talk about this, and why the hell you're<br/>here!"<p>The man hung his head and sat down on the<br/>floor. "Man."<p>"Noo! Don't hurt him!" screamed Usagi as she<br/>latched onto the man's back, trying to hold him<br/>back more than ever. "Stop it! Stop trying to kill<br/>him, and leave my super villains alone!"<p>"All right, that does it," snapped the<br/>intimidating figure as his form slowly melted<br/>away.<p>Usagi froze, absolute terror suddenly<br/>appearing on her face as she realized who she was<br/>holding in her grip. The ribbons fell away,<br/>seeming to almost be sheepish as they slumped off<br/>of the woman.<p>"Young lady, you'd better get your ass home,<br/>right now."<p>"Mom?" cried the girl as she simply fell to<br/>her knees. "No way!"<p>"Mom?" muttered Vahn. The whirring of<br/>machinery coming to life filled the room and a<br/>rage built up inside him. "A woman? A woman did<br/>this to me? I was beaten by a woman?"<p>Yohiko finally seemed to remember he was there<br/>and cursed under her breath. "Get lost Usagi, I'll<br/>handle this. He's an old friend of mine, and you<br/>and I are going to talk about this later."<p>The girl stumbled back, not even trying to<br/>argue.<p>"Auntie Yohiko?" said Ryoga as he poked his<br/>head around a corner. He shook for a moment, and<br/>then passed out cold.<p>"Nephrite, get them out of here and take them<br/>home. You'd better be there when I get back."<p>The man stood up from his seat and frowned.<br/>"Fine. Ya jerk."<p>Vahn's chest had slid open, revealing a<br/>compartment inside with a round red object inside.<br/>Yohiko growled as a black liquid seemed to form<br/>around her body, changing her form.<p>"Die! I'll kill you and your whole family!<br/>Revenge is mine!" he screamed as a small missile<br/>blasted from his chest. It took Yohiko dead center<br/>and threw her through a wall. There was an<br/>explosion on the other side, and the building<br/>started to burn.<p>"Mother! No!" screamed Usagi as she started to<br/>move.<p>Jadeite appeared behind her and grabbed her.<br/>"She's fine! That's not enough to kill her," he<br/>said sharply as he pulled her away without too<br/>much trouble. He grabbed Ryoga around his neck and<br/>the boy made no move to stop him. They all<br/>vanished in a flash of light.<p>Vahn growled as he saw this. "No! They have<br/>escaped!" He turned towards the smoldering hole<br/>and chuckled. "No matter, I shall send your family<br/>to meet you in hell soon enough."<p>There was a familiar sound from inside the<br/>hole, barely audible over the flames.<p>Vahn's sensors picked it up and he frowned.<br/>"What?"<p>It was the rhythmic sound of machinery moving,<br/>and the soft thump of footsteps.<p>"Freeze, creep," said a mechanical sounding<br/>voice.<p>Vahn stepped back in shock, not believing what<br/>he was seeing before him. A small armored man was<br/>walking out of the hole. "What is this?"<p>"You're under arrest," said the thing calmly.<br/>Its arm moved mechanically to its side, and a<br/>compartment opened out of its leg. A huge firearm<br/>appeared and moved into its grip.<p>"Is this some sort of joke?" snarled Vahn<br/>angrily as it raised its arm and began to fire at<br/>the thing.<p>The armored figure calmly walked forward,<br/>jerking only slightly as the occasional stray<br/>bullet struck it in the chest. "You're going<br/>down," it said in an emotionless monotone as it<br/>began to fire at Vahn.<p>Both of the machines were doing little damage<br/>to each other, they simply circled, firing at one<br/>another and doing nothing more than make sparks<br/>fly off each other's bodies.<p>Vahn quickly tired of this and charged<br/>forward. His claws opened wide and he dove for the<br/>thing.<p>"Big mistake," said the thing coldly.<p>"Eh?" muttered Vahn as he found his claws met<br/>with the thing's fists. They stood pushing on each<br/>other. Vahn chuckled as he pushed the thing back,<br/>easily sliding it slowly across the floor. "It<br/>seems you're weaker than I am. I'll tear you<br/>apart!"<p>"You'll try," said the thing calmly. "I'm<br/>afraid I can't allow that though.<p>"What?" said Vahn as he realized something was<br/>wrong. The thing didn't have the silver shine to<br/>it any longer. Instead it had turned jet black,<br/>the blackness was slowly moving up his arms and<br/>the robotic figure melted away to reveal the<br/>woman's face. "Heh. Fool."<p>"What are you doing?" cried Vahn as the<br/>darkness covered his chest.<p>"Too bad I've got other places to be tonight,<br/>I'd love to stay and play with you for a while,<br/>but I've got family business.<p>Vahn desperately tried to escape, he thrashed<br/>violently, but the woman's grip was iron solid.<br/>"No! It can't be!"<p>Yohiko chuckled as the darkness slowly started<br/>to seep into the cracks and seams of the robot,<br/>prying them apart slowly and moving through the<br/>innards of the monster. "Where are you?"<p>"No! This is impossible!" screamed Vahn in<br/>horror as he began to feel something sliding<br/>across what was left of his chest. he was deep<br/>inside the monstrosity, invulnerable to any<br/>attack.<p>"Ah, there you are," said Yohiko. "Goodbye."<p>Vahn went silent as a sharp pain exploded<br/>across his chest, the pressure that had started to<br/>build inside his armor had crushed him inside the<br/>beast. The machine went silent.<p>Yohiko chuckled and removed the last traces of<br/>the costume from inside Vahn's shell. "Well, that<br/>was quick."<p>"What's that noise?" asked Pissant.<p>"What noise?" asked Carrot.<p>"That beeping?" muttered Xainfu in confusion.<p>"Beeping?" muttered Dan. "Oh shit."<p>The entire building exploded in a spectacular<br/>ball of flame.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"Who are you really?" snarled Usagi angrily.<p>Jadeite was sitting across from Xellos with a<br/>frown on his face. "My real name is Nephrite. I'm<br/>an old friend of your...mother."<p>"What's going on here?" screamed the girl in<br/>frustration. "What happened to my mom?"<p>Xellos didn't look very comfortable. "She<br/>found her?"<p>"Yeah, we're screwed too," said Nephrite as he<br/>faded into Phibrizo.<p>"What the? What's going on? Who the hell is<br/>this kid?" screamed Usagi. "What happened to<br/>Jadeite?"<p>"Actually, my name is Jadeite, he's Nephrite,"<br/>said her Uncle with a small nervous chuckle.<p>"Huh?" cried the girl in frustration.<p>"I was training you," said Nephrite with a<br/>small shrug. "I was playing evil villain and<br/>keeping an eye on you."<p>"You kidnapped people to train me?" screamed<br/>the girl in anger.<p>"No, I just sort of showed up at the end and<br/>started giving orders. They were usually in so<br/>much chaos that they listened to me without<br/>question. I haven't really done anything," said<br/>the boy with a small shrug.<p>Ryoga stood next to the table with a horrified<br/>look on his face. "Could someone please tell me<br/>what's going on? Sailor Moon isn't really Auntie<br/>Yohiko's daughter is she?"<p>"Well, her mother's name is Yohiko..." said<br/>Xellos.<p>"This sucks," grumbled Usagi.<p>"How dare you! You raped me! My own cousin!"<br/>cried Ryoga in anguish.<p>"Shut the hell up! You should have told me you<br/>were a Hibiki!" cried the girl.<p>"Now, now. Wait, did you say rape?" Xellos<br/>paused and looked at the girl. "Oh, you didn't."<p>Nephrite seemed to catch on and looked at<br/>them. "You slept with your cousin?"<p>"Yes! No! I mean...We didn't know!" said Usagi<br/>as she hung her head.<p>"Man, no wonder Yohiko was so pissed," said<br/>Nephrite.<p>Both of them knew of this some time ago, but<br/>playing stupid now would make it easier to<br/>convince Yohiko that they were ignorant later. If<br/>she was as angry as Nephrite had said, it could<br/>possibly save their lives.<p>"Why isn't she here yet?" cried Usagi<br/>fearfully.<p>"Huh? Don't worry, Vahn's not strong enough to<br/>hurt her. Her costume is much more powerful than<br/>yours," said Xellos with a small smirk.<p>The girl nodded and watched the door. "I hope<br/>you're right."<p>"Staying there would have just put us in the<br/>way," commented Nephrite.<p>"In any case, there isn't much we can do now<br/>besides wait anyway," agreed Xellos.<p>"What's going on?" muttered Ryoga fearfully.<p>"We're waiting for Usagi's mother to get home<br/>to kill you, and hopefully we'll be able to talk<br/>our way out of it ourselves. I'd let you go, but<br/>I'm hoping she'll blow off enough steam to leave<br/>us alone after she's through with you," said<br/>Xellos.<p>"Yeah. Sorry, you understand right?" agreed<br/>Nephrite.<p>"What? Kill me?" cried the boy in shock.<p>"Don't worry Ryoga, I don't think it'll go<br/>that far..." said Usagi with a weak smile.<p>The door opened and slammed into the wall.<br/>Yohiko stood there with an aura burning around her<br/>as she glared into the room. "Now..."<p>++++++++++++<p>Nephrite, Jadeite, and Usagi all sat at the<br/>table in silence. None of them daring to speak.<br/>Ryoga was a broken pile of unconscious blood on<br/>the floor behind the intimidating woman.<p>"You're all going to tell me a story, a story<br/>about Sailor Moon, and why you thought it would be<br/>a good idea to keep it from me that my daughter<br/>was running around the streets at night, alone."<p>"She wasn't alone," grumbled Nephrite. "I was<br/>usually following her. Most of the time."<p>"Oh?" said Yohiko as she looked back at Ryoga.<p>"I had no idea! I swear!" cried the boy<br/>fearfully. "She must have done it after I left<br/>her! I was just training her! Xellos asked me to<br/>do it!"<p>The priest glared at Nephrite. "You little..."<p>"Oh, he did?" said Yohiko darkly.<p>"I didn't have any say in the matter. They<br/>were orders from further up," he said as he turned<br/>his head away. "I'd find a nice kidnapping or<br/>something, set her towards it. Gutless here would<br/>play villain while he kept her safe while she<br/>learned. After that was over our job was done and<br/>we assumed she was just coming home."<p>"Assumed? You?" said Yohiko with a frown on<br/>her face.<p>"All right. I'll admit I knew something was<br/>going on. I was trying to be nice and give the<br/>girl some privacy. I figured there was maybe a<br/>Mamoru running around, and she was meeting up with<br/>him."<p>"Privacy?" snorted Yohiko as her aura burned a<br/>little brighter.<p>"I'm a lot of things, and a voyeur isn't one<br/>of them," replied Xellos with a hurt look. "I<br/>don't spy on Carrot and Yohiko either. It's a<br/>family courtesy."<p>"So, you knew my daughter was running around<br/>with some strange boy, a boy who happens to be her<br/>cousin, and you said nothing?"<p>"Parenting isn't my job," said Xellos coldly.<br/>"It's my nature to be deceptive."<p>Yohiko sighed and stood up. She walked over to<br/>the kitchen and poured herself a cup of sake.<br/>After that, she poured another cup and walked back<br/>to the table with the bottle as well. She set it<br/>down at the table and put one of the cups in front<br/>of her daughter.<p>"Huh?" said Usagi dumbly.<p>"So, you want to play super hero do you?" said<br/>the woman with a smirk on her face.<p>"Well..." said the girl nervously as she<br/>looked away.<p>"Fine, I'm taking over your training as of<br/>now," she said calmly. She turned and glared at<br/>the pair opposite her. "Understood?"<p>Both men nodded.<p>"The only reason you two aren't dead, is<br/>because I know you're not here for this. It's<br/>something else, I'm not stupid enough to believe<br/>that you were sent here just because it was<br/>amusing either. They're up to something."<p>"Well, if you've already figured that out..."<br/>said Xellos with a slightly nervous laugh.<p>"You're moving out, right now," said Yohiko as<br/>she glared at him. "I'd better not see you again<br/>for at least a week. After that, maybe."<p>"Right," said Xellos as he hung his head.<p>"We can't just throw him into the street! He's<br/>helped me at least! I can't..."<p>"He's just moving in with Nephrite, that's<br/>all," said Yohiko with a small chuckle.<p>Usagi blinked and looked at the pair. They<br/>were already walking out the door. "Sorry, gotta<br/>go, bye!" said Xellos quickly as he rushed away.<p>"Traitors! How dare you leave me alone to face<br/>this!" cried the girl.<p>"Now as for you, your training starts tomorrow<br/>night," said Yohiko calmly.<p>"Man, I've got a feeling this is going to<br/>hurt," muttered the girl dejectedly.<p>"You have no idea," agreed Yohiko with an evil<br/>smirk. "As for tonight, you and I are getting<br/>drunk. I think you deserve it after what this<br/>pervert pulled." She glanced over her shoulder at<br/>Ryoga. The boy probably wouldn't wake up for a<br/>while, and when he did, he wouldn't be happy.<p>Usagi blushed and looked away. "I told you it<br/>was my fault. You didn't have to hurt him."<p>"That's the only reason he's still alive,"<br/>said Yohiko coldly. She smiled and pat the girl on<br/>her back. "Come on, you've got a broken heart, and<br/>I've got a gallon of ice-cream. Drink up."<p>The girl looked up at her mother and then<br/>downed the cup in front of her in a swift motion.<br/>She took a moment to catch her breath after that<br/>and almost gagged.<p>"Don't worry, it gets easier. Don't think I'm<br/>gonna let you get away with this later on either.<br/>You're still not old enough."<p>The girl nodded as her mother poured her<br/>another cup. "Okay."<p>"I suppose I should do something with him,"<br/>grumbled Yohiko as she looked at Ryoga for a<br/>moment. She sighed and lifted him onto her<br/>shoulder. She calmly walked across the room and<br/>opened the window before tossing him out.<p>"Mother!" cried Usagi in shock.<p>"He's fine. I was nice enough to open the<br/>window first," replied the woman with a shrug.<p>Usagi sighed and glanced at the window<br/>nervously before gulping down another shot. "Oh<br/>man. This sucks," she muttered to herself.<p>"Most things do dear," said Yohiko cheerfully<br/>as she joined her daughter and poured herself<br/>another glass as well.<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>No, not the end of this world arc just yet.<br/>One more story arc to go! Then I'll move on to the<br/>final world of Insertion.<p>
