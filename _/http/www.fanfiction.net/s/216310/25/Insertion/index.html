</div>Insertion<p>Part 24<p>Ranma Saotome and The Temple of Doom.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Shit!"<p>Ranma blinked as he walked with Hanna and Serena towards the<br/>temple the villagers had directed them to. They were walking in a<br/>relatively barren area along the edge of a steep cliff. There was<br/>nothing but small weeds and dirt for miles ahead of them. The evil<br/>looking temple loomed over them on a mountaintop in the distance.<br/>"What's up?"<p>Hanna was on her hands and knees, peering down a small hole in the<br/>ground. "I dropped my keys!"<p>"Huh?" said Serena dumbly.<p>"They fell down this hole," grumbled the woman as she peered down<br/>the crack in the earth at her feet.<p>"Reach down and get them," said Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"I can't see them...this is really deep too!" said the woman in<br/>frustration.<p>"We can't get back on the ship without them can we?" said Ranma<br/>with a scowl forming on his face.<p>"No," replied Hanna flatly.<p>"Great," muttered the boy as he sat down in the dirt for a moment.<br/>"I guess we dig."<p>"Where's that cave go?" asked Serena as she noticed a man sized<br/>hole in the ground about a hundred yards away.<p>"I dunno," said Ranma with a small shrug. "Let's find out. I'd<br/>hate to dig all the way down there just to find out we could have<br/>walked to them."<p>"That doesn't seem like such a good idea," muttered Hanna.<p>"So stay here then," replied Ranma with a small shrug as he stood<br/>up and started walking.<p>"I'll go with you," said Serena cheerfully.<p>"Come on then," said Ranma as he waved her towards him.<p>"Fine! I will stay here then!" snapped Hanna irritably as she sat<br/>down in the dust with her arms crossed over her chest.<p>++++++++++++<p>Just inside the cavern, Ranma pulled a flashlight off of his belt<br/>and flicked it on. "Stay close, we don't know what's in here."<p>"We don't?" muttered Serena nervously as she clung onto his back.<p>"No, we don't," said Ranma as he pushed her away a little. There<br/>was a wall of cobwebs ahead of them, and he brushed them aside and<br/>paused. "You know, this is the wrong movie."<p>Inside the cavern was an ancient and crumbling ruin of some kind.<br/>Statues were crumbling away with time, and roots and cobwebs hung from<br/>the ceiling overhead.<p>"What?" asked the girl in confusion.<p>"It's nothing," he replied calmly as he continued forward. "Look,<br/>maybe you should just wait outside. This place looks like it might<br/>have a few traps set up in it, and I'm not sure if they still work or<br/>not."<p>"No way! It's creepy out there!" said Serena as she backed away a<br/>little.<p>"And you don't think it's creepier in here? There's nothing<br/>outside but dirt," said Ranma as he turned to look at her in surprise.<p>"Well, you're not out there..." said the princess with a small<br/>blush forming on her cheeks. "And then there's that really weird<br/>looking building on the mountain..."<p>"Right, come on then, and don't touch anything unless I say," he<br/>said with a small defeated sigh.<p>+++++++++++<p>Outside, Hanna pulled a small box from her traveling bag. "I'm<br/>hungry she muttered as she started to open it. She paused when she<br/>felt something brush up against her leg. Slowly, she turned her eyes<br/>down and screamed in terror at the huge insect that was beginning to<br/>crawl up her leg. She tossed the box into the air and jumped back,<br/>firing several shots with her blaster and vaporizing the insect, along<br/>with about a foot of the ground around it.<p>After a moment, she paused and looked down at where she had<br/>dropped her lunch. "Shit!" She peered down the hole once again and<br/>groaned in frustration. "This just isn't my day."<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma and Serena found themselves walking down a narrow hallway<br/>with several small windows along one wall, they were very high up, and<br/>shone down on the hallway giving a small amount of light to the room.<p>"Wait!" said Ranma as he pushed Serena back against the wall,<br/>preventing her from moving foreword.<p>"What is it?" she muttered fearfully.<p>"Stay out of the light."<p>"Okay," muttered the girl with a confused looking frown.<p>Ranma stuck out his hand into one of the light beams and...nothing<br/>happened. He pulled his hand back and sighed with relief. "False<br/>alarm."<p>"Okay," replied Serena as she walked along behind him cheerfully.<p>They reached the end of the hall without incident and Ranma turned<br/>towards the hallway again. "I could have sworn..."<p>Several walls of spears poked out of the wall along their path,<br/>just in front of the light beams.<p>"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" cried Serena in alarm as she jumped onto<br/>his side and clung to him.<p>"Oh, I guess this place is kinda old," said the boy with a small<br/>shrug as he continued foreword.<p>+++++++++++<p>A moment later, they found themselves looking at a small<br/>bottomless pit.<p>"How are we gonna get across this?" muttered the princess.<p>"Huh?" Ranma lifted her up into his arms and hopped across easily.<br/>"That's how."<p>"Oh," said the girl with a heavy blush on her face as he put her<br/>down. "Are we coming out this way too?" she asked hopefully.<p>"Probably," he replied with a small shrug.<p>They walked into the next room and paused. There was a small<br/>golden statue, a box, and a set of keys all sitting on a pedestal in<br/>the middle of the room.<p>"Well, that was easy," said Serena as she started foreword.<p>"That's what scares me," said Ranma as he shoved her into the wall<br/>again.<p>"Could you stop that?" said the princess with a small frown on her<br/>face.<p>Ranma looked at her and picked up a large broken piece of wood<br/>from the ground nearby. He placed it on one of the diamond shaped<br/>tiles that lined the floor and pressed down slowly. It gave way, and a<br/>split second later a small dart was embedded into the wood.<p>"On second thought, do that whenever you feel like it," amended<br/>the girl.<p>"Right," replied Ranma with a small smirk. "I'm going to get those<br/>keys, you wait here."<p>Just as he started to step forward, a terrifying sound met his<br/>ears. It ran chills up his spine and he backed away from the room.<p>"Niyou."<p>The sound was repeated several times as about a dozen cats started<br/>to walk out onto the floor fearlessly.<p>"Is something wrong?" asked the princess.<p>"Cats...why'd it have to be...cats?" muttered Ranma as he edged<br/>back towards the door. He turned towards Serena and smiled weakly.<br/>"Look, you're gonna have to go get those keys."<p>"Me?" said the girl in shock.<p>"I have this little problem with those things out there ya see,"<br/>said the boy nervously as he pointed towards the cats.<p>"You mean those kitties?" muttered Serena in wonder.<p>"Shut up and go get the keys!" snapped the boy as he glared at her<br/>for a moment.<p>"But...I'll get stuck by those darts," she replied nervously.<p>"Look, just don't step on any of the tiles shaped like that. The<br/>other ones are all safe," said Ranma as he pointed at one of the<br/>diamond shaped stones.<p>"Oh. I guess I could..." said the girl nervously. She took a<br/>tentative step forward and started on her way. After several moments,<br/>she was standing in front of the pedestal.<p>She picked up the keys and looked at the statue for a moment. It<br/>was a golden cat with jewels for eyes. "Pretty!" she exclaimed.<p>"Don't touch that!" warned Ranma.<p>Serena looked back at him and shrugged her shoulders as she put<br/>the keys into her pocket. Then she saw the box. "What's this?" She<br/>lifted it up into her hands and opened it.<p>Ranma winced, but managed to keep silent as she picked it up.<br/>After a moment, nothing happened and he breathed a sigh of relief.<br/>"So? What is it?"<p>"I dunno. Food," she replied as she showed the open box to him.<br/>"What should I do?"<p>Ranma looked at the contents and shrugged. "Leave the statue, take<br/>the cannolli."<p>"Okay," she replied as she whirled around to head back.<p>Ranma's jaw dropped as her hair flew in a wide arc, and knocked<br/>the statue off of the pedestal. It shattered on the ground, revealing<br/>it to be nothing more than cheap ceramics.<p>"Oopsie," said Serena as she looked at what she had done.<p>A low rumbling filled the room and Ranma cursed under his breath.<br/>"Run you idiot!"<p>"Huh?" muttered Serena as she looked up and saw the wall beginning<br/>to collapse behind her. "EEEEEKKK!" she cried as she tore across the<br/>floor.<p>Darts whizzed by as she rushed back towards Ranma. Occasionally,<br/>an angry sounding yowl would sound as the projectiles struck one of<br/>the animals.<p>Serena finally made it and rushed into Ranma's arms. "I did it!"<br/>she cried.<p>"Yes! Ten points!" cried Ranma as he raised his arm into the air.<p>"Huh?" muttered the girl in confusion. She turned to see all<br/>twelve of the cats were lying on the ground with darts stuck in them.<br/>"Oopsie," she repeated.<p>"Come on!" cried the boy as he pulled her along behind her as the<br/>temple started to crumble around them.<p>They rushed into the next room and Serena looked up at Ranma<br/>again. He picked her up into his arms again and she hugged his neck<br/>tightly. Once he landed on the other side she refused to let go and he<br/>continued to run forward as the wall threatened to close them into the<br/>room. He moved into the next area of the temple and looked back. "I<br/>think we missed something."<p>"Why are you stopping?" cried the princess as she kicked her feet<br/>in alarm.<p>"Oh. Right," said the boy as he started forward again, rushing<br/>through the hall of spears again. Once on the other side he paused and<br/>looked back over his shoulder. "Three, two, one..." All the spears<br/>shot out from the wall again.<p>The temple seemed to have calmed now, and Ranma put the girl down.<br/>"We should be all right from here. No, wait... there's something<br/>else..."<p>"What is it?" she muttered nervously.<p>Another rumbling started and the pair looked back to see an<br/>oversized smoothed down boulder rolling down on them from the ceiling.<p>"That," said Ranma as he grabbed her hand and started to pull.<br/>They rushed through the hall as the huge stone bore down on them,<br/>making it to the entrance just ahead of it.<p>"I don't want to dieeeeeeeee!" cried Serena as Ranma lifted her<br/>into his arms and jumped out of the exit.<p>++++++++++++<p>Hanna blinked as she stared down the hole. There was a lot of<br/>muffled noise coming from down there and she struggled to hear what<br/>was happening. "What the hell are those two idiots doing down there?"<br/>She suddenly paused and blushed. "It couldn't be! He wouldn't! She<br/>wouldn't!" She put her face up against the hole, and...promptly got a<br/>face full of dust as a huge geyser of it shot up from the hole.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Well, that was pointless," said Ranma as he sat up from where he<br/>had landed. Serena was lying across his lap, a look of fear still<br/>etched onto her features.<p>The girl seemed to come to life all at once, latching onto his<br/>neck and bursting into tears. "You! You saved me!"<p>"Hey! Cut that out," snapped the boy as he pulled her away. "Let's<br/>just go. All right."<p>+++++++++++<p>"Well, here we are. Now what?" said Hanna as she looked at the<br/>pair.<p>"We could go up to the palace...or we could take that suspicious<br/>looking cave over there. The one with the keep out sign, and the<br/>painful screaming and whip cracking coming out of it," said Ranma as<br/>he laid out their choices.<p>"What are we gonna do? Go up and ask them if they have an evil<br/>cult living under their palace?" said Hanna snidely.<p>++++++++++<p>"Hiya!" said Ranma cheerfully as he adjusted the gray ball cap on his<br/>head and smiled at the man who answered the door.<p>"Who are you? Do you have an appointment?" said the stuffy looking<br/>man in a turban.<p>"No. We're exterminators," said Ranma cheerfully. "We got a call<br/>about an evil child stealing cult in your basement."<p>"Pardon?" said the man in confusion.<p>"Yeah. You gotta take care of these infestations fast, or they<br/>rise up and make the villages miserable. So, where's the door to the<br/>basement?" Ranma walked in with the two girls directly behind him.<p>"Um...this way?" said the confused looking man as he led them into<br/>the home.<p>"I can't believe this worked," muttered Hanna dumbly.<p>++++++++++++<p>"This is the basement," said the man as he crossed his arms and<br/>glared at them. "We don't have any evil cults as you can plainly see.<br/>Now I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave."<p>They looked around and saw nothing more than a wine cellar.<p>Ranma looked at the man and paused. "This is the palace of the<br/>Thugee isn't it?"<p>"No," replied the man with a small sigh. "That place is on the<br/>bottom of the mountain. You take a right at the cave at the base. They<br/>keep taking the road sign down. This is historical Al'shira. No one<br/>lives here, and I'm a tour guide."<p>"Oh," said Ranma dumbly. "Well, sorry to bother you then."<p>"Quite," replied the man in irritation.<p>Ranma conked him on the head and sent him into the dust. He fell<br/>on his face out cold.<p>"Why did you do that?" asked Hanna.<p>"He might be in league with the evil cult. I don't want him<br/>warning them that we're coming."<p>"Oh," said Serenity.<p>"Come on," said Ranma as he walked towards the stairs.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma looked up at the imposing temple that was carved into the<br/>side of the mountain. There was about a dozen guard milling about the<br/>front with blasters at their sides. "Well, let's go," he said as he<br/>pulled the large shotgun like weapon off of his back.<p>"Wait! What the hell are you doing? You're just going to walk up<br/>there and start shooting?" snapped Hanna as she grabbed him by his arm<br/>and stopped him.<p>"Well...yeah kinda," he said as he looked at her. "That was my<br/>plan anyway."<p>"But...we'll die," said Serenity nervously. She was holding a<br/>weapon much to large for her and scuffed her feet in the dirt.<p>"Come on, these are lousy minions. They never shoot good," said<br/>Ranma cheerfully as he cocked the weapon.<p>The group paused as the guards began to toss glass bottles into<br/>the air and shoot them. Not one of them missed.<p>Ranma looked at the two women and shrugged. "Okay. New plan."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"This is your plan? Go in the back way and start shooting?"<br/>grumbled Hanna as she hid behind the cover of a few boulders with<br/>Ranma and Serenity.<p>"Yeah. Catch em by surprise," he said cheerfully. "I'm gonna scout<br/>ahead, you two wait here."<p>++++++++++++<p>A short time later, he turned a corner stealthily and blinked as<br/>he found himself standing on a set of railroad tracks. "Huh?" he<br/>muttered dumbly as a small light formed a short distance ahead of him.<p>A small mining cart was speeding towards him. The occupant was<br/>screaming madly in terror as he rocketed towards the boy.<p>Ranma blinked once, and fired his weapon at the base of the<br/>vehicle. It flipped over several times in the air before crashing down<br/>into the ground rather loudly. He winced and looked around, after a<br/>moment nothing happened and he breathed a sigh of relief. He walked<br/>over and kicked the former occupant of the cart, he had been flipped<br/>out when the boy had first stopped it.<p>It obviously wasn't human. It jumped up, two huge floppy ears on<br/>its head moving erratically as it looked around nervously. The thing<br/>had a duckbill and leathery skin. "Ohhhhh..."<p>"What the?" muttered Ranma as he lowered his weapon and stared at<br/>it for a moment.<p>"You! Yousa saving me! I berry berry grateful! Mine being Jar..."<p>Ranma screamed and ignited his lightsaber, hacking the thing in half<br/>where it stood. "No freaking way!"<p>Hanna and Serena rushed up behind him. "What was that noise?" said<br/>Hanna.<p>"You killed it!" cried Serena as she looked at the thing's remains.<p>"Had to be done," said Ranma calmly as he closed the saber and<br/>hooked it back onto his belt.<p>"Didn't seem very hostile to me," muttered Hanna.<p>"Trust me," said Ranma as he looked at them. "It -had- to be<br/>done."<p>The pair shrugged their shoulders and started walking after him as<br/>he moved off.<p>"I thought I told you two to stay put," he muttered as he looked<br/>back at them for a moment.<p>"Well there were all these guards, and you weren't there, so I..."<br/>started Serena.<p>"Never mind, just come on," said Ranma as he moved into one of the<br/>caves.<p>++++++++++++<p>"What is this?" said Serena as she looked down off the edge of the<br/>small cliff into a large open room filled with men in loincloths<br/>bowing to a huge skull like shrine.<p>"Some kind of ritual I guess. Either that, or a mass tanning booth<br/>of some kind," replied the boy as he pointed at the lava pit between<br/>the worshipers and the shrine.<p>"I like that first one," said Serena.<p>"I think so too," agreed the boy cheerfully.<p>"Ugh, you'd think with all this mining, they could afford some<br/>decent clothes," said Hanna in disgust.<p>A huge squealing animal was brought onto the shrine by about four<br/>men. They pulled it over to a large metal harness of some kind and<br/>latched it in.<p>While this was going on, three other men walked into the room with<br/>small stones in their grasp. They were smooth, and had crescent moon<br/>symbols on the front of them. They began to glow as they came closer<br/>to one another.<p>"What are those?" said Hanna.<p>"I've heard of stones like those. When they're brought together,<br/>the diamonds inside them are said to glow," said Ranma with a small<br/>nod.<p>"Diamonds?" muttered Hanna as she looked back at him.<p>"I heard it was crystals actually," said Serena.<p>"Something like that," replied the boy with a small shrug.<p>"Don't get me all excited like that!" cried Hanna angrily.<p>A man dressed in a long dark cape, with a scary looking horned<br/>skull hat on walked onto the shrine. He raised his hands into the air<br/>and glared out at the crowd before him for a long moment. "Our task is<br/>complete! Rejoice!"<p>He ceremoniously walked over to the animal in the cage and took<br/>out a small bowl of something. He dipped a small brush into the<br/>substance and began to paint the animal with strange, messy, swooping<br/>motions. "Praise be to she who will deliver us into prosperity!"<p>The cage was turned sideways, and the animal began to squeal<br/>loudly as a pit opened up underneath it. Two large men lowered the<br/>animal down slowly into the heated lava below. The stopped when the<br/>squeals stopped and locked the chains where they were hanging. The<br/>animal was several hundred feet above the surface of the heated lava.<p>A great cry of triumph roared from the worshipers in the crowd.<br/>They jumped up and started dancing excitedly. Several long poles were<br/>brought out, and the men began to dance excitedly.<p>"What the hell?" said Ranma in confusion.<p>"Some sort of sick ritual?" muttered Hanna.<p>"No, it's a..."<p>"Luau, for the managers of the project," said a voice from behind<br/>them.<p>Ranma turned and fired a single shot. A large man in a turban<br/>jumped back and raised his hands in alarm. He had been standing behind<br/>them watching the scene purposefully.<p>"The one for the security force is next week. The workers had<br/>theirs last night!" muttered the man fearfully.<p>"Who are you? What's going on here?" snapped Serena as she stepped<br/>foreword.<p>"Princess Serenity!" cried the man fearfully. "I had no idea you<br/>were here to visit! Please forgive me!" The man bowed deeply to them<br/>and Ranma lowered his weapon.<p>"What the hell?" he grumbled as he watched the man prostrate<br/>himself in front of them.<p>++++++++++++<p>"They told you that we were an evil cult who stole their sacred<br/>stone, and enslaved their children?" muttered the well-dressed man who<br/>sat across from them at an elegant looking table in a dinning hall.<p>"Well, yeah," said Ranma flatly. "We just came to check things<br/>out, and that's when we found your little party."<p>"Well. I'm very disappointed then. We contracted their children to<br/>work in the mines. They sold them to us, along with their sacred<br/>stones. It wasn't our fault they wasted the money."<p>"You contracted the children?" said Hanna in disgust.<p>"The tunnels we use are very small, the children are well fed and<br/>rested. We are not a slave force after all. Their quality of life here<br/>is better than the village they came from. They were all returning at<br/>the end of the week anyway. We only wanted them for a month or so, we<br/>needed the extra hands, and none of the adults were willing to work<br/>here. All of them sent their children instead."<p>"An entire village of Genma Saotome," muttered Ranma in shock.<p>"Who?" said Hanna as she turned to look at him.<p>"It's nothing," he replied. He then turned back towards the man<br/>again. "What are you digging for anyway."<p>"We found what we were looking for actually. The three sacred<br/>stones are an ancient power that was sealed away millennia ago, by one<br/>of the distant relatives of the young princess and the queen. Serenity<br/>wanted us to find them for her, when the three stones are broken, and<br/>the crystals inside brought together, they form a powerful magic<br/>crystal."<p>"The Silver Imperium Crystal," said Ranma with a small nod.<p>"Yes, I see you've heard the legend," said the man with a cheerful<br/>smile.<p>"Of it yes, I've never actually heard the whole story though,"<br/>replied Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"The whole story is a family secret," explained Serenity<br/>cheerfully. "No one knows it but the queen and princess of the moon."<p>"To protect the location of the crystals. General Nephrite will be<br/>here in about a week to retrieve the crystal, and return it to the<br/>queen," said the man cheerfully. "I must say, it was a surprise to<br/>find you visiting us."<p>"Yeah, well, we've got to get back soon. Places to be and all<br/>that, we've got a bit of work to do before we take off though."<p>"I'll arrange for a transport for you," said the man cheerfully.<p>"That'd be nice," said Hanna. "It was a long walk."<p>"By the way...Why didn't we just take the landspeeder?" muttered<br/>Serena as she suddenly seemed to think about it.<p>"Ummm..." said Ranma as he tried to think of a reason.<p>"ARRRGGGHHH!" cried Hanna as she hit her head on the table in<br/>frustration.<p>"I must say. I've heard rumors that the princess was missing. I'm<br/>greatly relieved that they aren't true," said the man as he smiled at<br/>the young girl for a moment.<p>"Heh. Well, thanks," said Serena nervously with a blush forming on<br/>her face.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Ready?" said Hanna as she sat back in the cockpit of the ship and<br/>started the engines.<p>"Let's just get out of this place," said Ranma with a heavy sigh.<p>"Where to next?" said Serena cheerfully.<p>"Well, you said you were going to Mercury right?" said Ranma with<br/>a small sigh.<p>"Yup!" replied the girl cheerfully.<p>"I guess we might as well head that way. They won't be expecting<br/>us there." Ranma pointed at the spot on the star chart and smirked.<br/>"We'll just drop you off there, you can do your little mission, and<br/>that'll be the end of that."<p>"Right," muttered Hanna as she pulled back the controls. The ship<br/>jumped into light speed and threw them all back into their seats<br/>suddenly.<p>"Hey. I just thought of something," muttered Ranma dumbly.<p>"What's that?" grumbled Hanna.<p>"We could have just left her with that guy, Nephrite would have<br/>given her a ride home, and...AAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!" He hit his<br/>head on the control panel in frustration.<p>Serena merely smiled blissfully.<p>"You asshole! Why didn't you say so sooner!" cried Hanna.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Senshi, we don't need their scum," commented one of the<br/>commanders on board the flagship of the imperial fleet. He paused and<br/>looked up to see a shorthaired blonde woman glaring down at him. The<br/>pathetic man swallowed and scurried away.<p>Queen Serenity paced in front of the short-skirted warriors. Seven<br/>of the nine women were present. "Jupiter alone has been unsuccessful.<br/>I want you to find my daughter and bring her back, alive."<p>Neptune turned and looked at her for a moment.<p>"No disintegration," said the queen firmly as she paused in front<br/>of Uranus.<p>"As you wish," replied the woman icily.<p>"The senshi who is successful will be rewarded once they return<br/>quite handsomely. I want my daughter back, I don't care what you have<br/>to do to get her back to me alive and unharmed."<p>"What of the threat from the Federation?" asked Mars as she looked<br/>at the woman.<p>"I have someone working on that as we speak. Nephrite is currently<br/>on a mission for me that will ensure our victory. He will return at<br/>the end of the week."<p>Mercury nodded at this and looked over at Venus for a moment.<p>"Now go, and don't come back without my daughter," said the Queen<br/>as she turned away from them.<p>"Bitch," muttered Mars under her breath as she followed her fellow<br/>Senshi out of the room.<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>
