</div>Insertion<p>Part 66<p>The price of womanhood.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome, the Lord of Nightmares and<br/>ruler of the entire universe stared down into the<br/>pool in front of him and chuckled as he watched<br/>the scene play out before him.<p>"You know they hate us," said Ranma flatly.<p>"Yeah, we'll get over it," said Carrot calmly.<p>"I don't mind," said Xianfu with a small<br/>shrug.<p>"You're just happy because you finally got<br/>your way," said Dan calmly.<p>"Maybe we should stop letting Carrot do so<br/>much," whimpered Pissant.<p>"Hey, you know my plans always work out<br/>towards something," said Carrot irritably. "As<br/>much as I'd enjoy doing this for no reason, I do<br/>have a master plan."<p>"Yeah, a master plan to see how much you can<br/>get away with," snorted Ranma.<p>"Look, It'll work out, I promise. Besides, she<br/>did it on her own. I just made sure she had the<br/>opportunity. That's all," said Carrot defensively.<p>"You probably enjoyed it too," said Dan as he<br/>narrowed his eyes.<p>"She was the only one awake," said Carrot<br/>irritably.<p>"He's right," admitted Ranma. "He was kind<br/>enough to make sure we didn't wake up." He didn't<br/>sound too happy with what had happened himself<br/>though.<p>"What is the point of this?" snorted Dan.<p>"Well, I want them to do something in<br/>particular, and I'm hoping this will be enough to<br/>put the idea in our head," said Carrot with a<br/>shrug.<p>"Idea?" muttered Ranma.<p>"I knew it, you pervert," snorted Xianfu.<p>"Not that idea you bitch!" snapped Carrot.<br/>"Jeez, I'm not like that!"<p>"What idea are you talking about?" asked<br/>Ranma.<p>"Honey, I..." Hotaru walked into the room and<br/>looked down at the pool for a moment. She blinked<br/>and looked up at her husband for a moment. "What<br/>the hell are you doing?"<p>"Nothing dear, It's all part of our..." They<br/>backed away suddenly as the woman got a fierce<br/>look in her eyes.<p>"What the hell did you do to them?" snarled<br/>Hotaru.<p>"Wait! It's important, I needed them too..."<p>"You had some fantasy, and you couldn't tell<br/>me about it? Is that it? I can see why you<br/>wouldn't...but..."<p>"No! It's not like that!" cried the god<br/>fearfully. "Look, they weren't even awake! It was<br/>just her, honest!"<p>"Her?" Hotaru looked at them for a moment.<br/>"Xianfu?"<p>"Yeah, I mean," the god calmed slightly.<p>"Hey, it's been almost a thousand years," said<br/>the feminine voice with a small shrug. "I got<br/>needs too ya know."<p>"I thought you'd been hanging around Zocite<br/>and Kunzite a bit much lately," said Hotaru as she<br/>narrowed her eyes.<p>"What? Stop that! We don't have those kinds<br/>of desires!" cried the god in defense of himself.<p>"Wait a minute! What do you mean a thousand<br/>years?" said Dan as he realized what the woman had<br/>said.<p>"Well, I was in heaven for a while. I got<br/>drunk at a party, and Thor thought I was pretty<br/>cute. So one thing led to another and..."<p>"We don't need to know any more," said Carrot<br/>as he turned towards Hotaru.<p>The woman was simply staring at them with a<br/>blank looking expression on her face. "Well, those<br/>springs of yours still work. I suppose if it would<br/>make you happy..." She blushed and got a slightly<br/>disgusted look on her face.<p>"You'd do that?" muttered Xianfu in wonder.<p>"NO! Hell no!" screamed the others all at<br/>once.<p>"The whole point of this was to avoid things<br/>like that! Jeez, wasn't that enough?" said Carrot.<p>"What? After a thousand years of nothing, you<br/>think once is going to be enough?" said Xianfu<br/>flatly.<p>"Well, err..." muttered Ranma.<p>"She's got a point," said Pissant.<p>"Who's side are you on?" growled Dan angrily.<br/>"Hey! I bet you were awake for that!"<p>"I was not!" cried the voice angrily.<p>Hotaru wasn't sure if she should be angry with<br/>them for being perverts, or sympathetic with them.<br/>She sighed and turned away. "Look, when you get<br/>this sexual frustration out of your system, I'll<br/>come back."<p>"Wait!" cried Carrot as he stumbled over the<br/>pool and fell face first on the floor.<p>The door closed in their faces as their wife<br/>left them alone.<p>"Great, it's all your fault everyone thinks<br/>we're gay," said Carrot angrily.<p>Xianfu shrugged. "You can't fault me for not<br/>being gay."<p>"The hell we can't," snapped Dan. "If you<br/>were, our lives would be much easier."<p>"He's got a point," admitted Ranma.<p>"Well I'm not, deal with it," she said curtly<br/>in reply.<p>"Shouldn't we be making sure we don't kill<br/>anybody?" said Pissant quietly.<p>"Oh, right," said Carrot.<p>++++++++++++<p>Yusaku woke up from a wonderful dream. The sun<br/>was warm in his face and he felt so refreshed.<br/>Everything about the morning seemed so right, and<br/>now. He turned his head slightly and his face<br/>fell.<p>Yohiko was looking at him.<p>Yohiko wasn't speaking.<p>Yohiko...did not look happy at all.<p>"Um. Did we...?" he ventured quietly.<p>++++++++++<p>"NO! NO! NO! NO!" muttered Ranma in a mantra<br/>as his brain completely shut down.<p>Dan hadn't spoken yet, well, not if you call<br/>an animalistic growl not speaking.<p>Carrot was simply too stunned to move. He had<br/>managed to pull the sheets over their body and<br/>move up against the wall.<p>Xainfu was feeling quite satisfied with<br/>herself. "Take that," she said merrily.<p>Pissant did the dumbest thing he possibly<br/>could, he spoke what was on his mind out loud.<p>"Why does our mouth taste funny?"<p>+++++++++++<p>Yusaku was feeling a sort of fearful joy at<br/>that moment. It seemed his dream had become a<br/>reality. If that was true though, why was he<br/>feeling the overwhelming sense of dread? Why was<br/>every muscle in his body screaming for him to run<br/>away as fast as he could and not look back. Why,<br/>was Yohiko glowing?<p>"SHI SHI HOUKOU DAN!"<p>+++++++++++<p>Usagi blinked as an explosion rocked her out<br/>of bed. She hit the ground headfirst and sat<br/>upright immediately. "Huh? What the hell?" She<br/>quickly stood up and rushed out of her room.<br/>Xellos was sitting at the table drinking coffee<br/>and she gasped as she saw sunlight outside. "I<br/>slept in?" she muttered under her breath. "This<br/>has got to be a dream, mom would never..."<p>"Your mother isn't home," said Xellos calmly.<p>"She's not?" said the girl in wonder. "Where<br/>is she?"<p>"I think that's her screaming in the hallway<br/>now," said the man as he calmly sipped at his<br/>drink and continued to read the paper.<p>Yohiko blinked as she opened the door and saw<br/>her mother rush by in the nude, with only a sheet<br/>covering her body. She was screaming bloody murder<br/>and turned into the bathroom.<p>"Um...Mom?" said the girl tentatively as she<br/>walked over. She stepped back as the sound of<br/>someone becoming violently sick suddenly came from<br/>one of the toilets.<p>She turned stepped out of the room and noticed<br/>Yusaku's door looked like it had been ripped out<br/>of the wall. She wasn't sure what to make of that<br/>and walked back into the bathroom again. She<br/>blushed when she saw her mother kneeling over one<br/>of the toilets.<p>"Mom?" she muttered as she stepped closer.<p>"It isn't true, it can't be," said her mother<br/>in a sort of mad mumble. She was repeating it to<br/>herself over and over.<p>"Mother, are you all right?" she asked as she<br/>put her hand on the woman's shoulder. The woman<br/>jumped suddenly and pushed herself against the<br/>wall as she jerked away.<p>"Mom? Is Yusaku dead?" said the girl quietly.<p>"God I hope so," said the woman with a fearful<br/>look in her eyes.<p>Usagi nodded and turned away. She walked out<br/>into the hallway and noticed everyone looking at<br/>her from their doorways. "You'll all pretend<br/>nothing happened if you know what's good for you,"<br/>she called out to everyone.<p>The doors quickly shut and the hallway became<br/>empty.<p>Usagi sighed and walked into the man's room.<br/>She looked around for a moment and surveyed the<br/>damage. The wall to the outside was completely<br/>gone, nothing more than a smoking hole. Yusaku was<br/>not inside the room, but she could see him<br/>sticking his legs out of a hole in the ground<br/>about twenty yards away from the building. He was<br/>naked, and occasionally one of his legs would<br/>twitch.<p>"Oh my," she said under her breath as she<br/>frowned. "Mom? What on earth did you do?" Her mind<br/>went back to the Bakusai Tenketsu, but this was<br/>far beyond that level of destruction. It had to be<br/>something else, something she hadn't seen yet. She<br/>idly wondered just how powerful her mother really<br/>was. With a small sigh she jumped down into the<br/>yard from the hole and wandered over to Yusaku's<br/>twitching form.<p>"Hey, Godai, you alive?" she asked as she<br/>poked him in the leg with her finger.<p>He moaned painfully and she pulled him out of<br/>the hole. With a slight blush she tossed a towel<br/>she had grabbed from his room over his more<br/>personal areas and kneeled down next to him.<br/>"Listen, I know you like her, but whatever you did<br/>to mom, you'd better not do it again. She's real<br/>upset." She frowned deeply and growled at him as<br/>he lay there smoking. "Jerk, I'm sure not gonna<br/>help you get any more dates. That's for sure."<p>He moaned painfully, unable to respond to<br/>that.<p>Usagi sighed and picked him up carefully. She<br/>was hoping it wasn't what she thought it was, if<br/>it was, she'd help her mother kill him. Still, she<br/>didn't know everything yet, and Uncle Xellos<br/>always told her it was bad to act without knowing<br/>as much as you could. No matter how upset you<br/>were.<p>She came through the doorway and found her<br/>uncle watching her with an unreadable expression<br/>on his face.<p>"So, what do you think happened?" she asked<br/>him.<p>"Not much, they probably had sex," he replied<br/>with a small shrug. "She seems to be taking it<br/>well."<p>Usagi blinked and looked towards the bathroom<br/>again. She could still hear her mother retching<br/>violently. "She is?"<p>"Well, the building is still here," replied<br/>the man with a small shrug. "In any case, it would<br/>be a bad idea to bring him into your apartment.<br/>We'd best put him back into his own room until she<br/>calms down a bit."<p>Usagi sighed and nodded her head. "Mom<br/>probably got drunk."<p>"Most likely, that young lad isn't stupid<br/>enough to initiate something like that on his<br/>own," said Xellos with a short nod. His knowing<br/>grin widened a little as she carried Yusaku<br/>through the broken remains of his door. "Well,<br/>isn't this interesting?"<p>++++++++++++<p>Several hours later...<p>++++++++++++<p>Yohiko staggered through the streets of Tokyo<br/>with a numb look on her face. After she'd finished<br/>throwing up in the bathroom, she'd walked out,<br/>reverted to her male form, and simply walked in<br/>silence.<p>The sun had set a short time earlier and she<br/>continued to walk. "We missed work today," said<br/>Carrot as he looked up at the sky.<p>"We'll handle that later, that idiot principal<br/>won't pose much of a problem," commented Dan.<p>The pair were strangely calm, there was a<br/>boiling rage somewhere in the back of their<br/>consciousness though. The had no idea when Ranma<br/>was going to make his presence known again and<br/>release that anger.<p>"Where are we going?" asked Xianfu.<p>"Shut the hell up," snapped Carrot bitterly.<p>"Still haven't forgiven me?" she asked coldly.<br/>The situation seemed almost amusing to her.<p>"I wouldn't be worried about us, when Ranma<br/>finally snaps out of his little quiet time, he's<br/>going to do something we'll all probably regret,"<br/>replied Carrot calmly. "We aren't going to stop<br/>him either."<p>"You claim to be angry," snorted the woman<br/>hatefully.<p>"Ha. Claim my ass lady, we're all pissed,"<br/>snorted Carrot.<p>"You seem calm enough," said the woman.<p>"That's because I'm still planning what I'm<br/>going to do with you," said the voice as a sudden<br/>chill fell over them.<p>"What can you do?" she snapped. "You have no<br/>right to be angry."<p>"No right, you..." snarled Dan as his own<br/>temper surged up. "How dare you..."<p>"How dare I what? Do the exact same thing<br/>you've been doing to me since we all<br/>became...this...whatever we are?" she snapped.<br/>"Now you know how I feel!"<p>"Lady, you have no idea what you've just<br/>fucked with," said Dan coldly.<p>"I think I do," she replied calmly. "Where the<br/>hell are we anyway?" She paused as she looked up<br/>at the building in front of them. There was a<br/>vicious smirk on their face as they stared up into<br/>the windows of a small mansion. The windows in the<br/>building all had a red glow to them. "You<br/>wouldn't!" she gasped in horror.<p>"He Dan, feel like asserting our manhood?"<br/>said Carrot with a small chuckle.<p>"You know it," said the man as their smile<br/>grew sinister.<p>"Help me stop them!" snapped Xianfu angrily as<br/>she struggled with their body.<p>Pissant said nothing and remained hidden away.<p>Ranma's consciousness surfaced suddenly and<br/>the woman gasped.<p>"Let's go," he said to the other two men.<br/>Waves of anger and rage were pouring from his<br/>spirit.<p>"Oh god no," muttered the woman in horror.<p>+++++++++++<p>They entered the building and smirked at the<br/>woman who approached them and took their coat.<p>"Welcome," she said seductively.<p>"Hello," he replied coldly. His smirk fell a<br/>bit as she saw her shrink back ever so slightly.<br/>The anger that they were putting off was making<br/>the half-dressed women around them uncomfortable.<br/>None of them understood why, but he managed to<br/>quell it quite a bit and he could feel them relax.<p>"What is your desire?" she asked him with a<br/>smirk on her face as she led him towards the group<br/>of girls sitting off to the side.<p>He snorted and handed her a large roll of<br/>money. "I'm going to be here a while tonight."<p>"Think you can handle it?" said the woman as<br/>she snorted in amusement. She'd seen men come in<br/>like this before, all of them were quickly<br/>humbled.<p>"You four," said Dan as he pointed at a<br/>particularly attractive group of females that were<br/>sitting together.<p>They looked at one another and smiled wickedly<br/>as they stood up and moved towards the handsome<br/>man who stood waiting for them. As they moved<br/>around him and grabbed his arms he turned his head<br/>and smirked at the woman who had greeted him.<br/>"Later."<p>She wasn't sure if he was naming her as a<br/>potential target, or saying goodnight. She blinked<br/>and shook her head as the girls led him up the<br/>stairs to one of the rooms.<p>+++++++++++++<p>The three of them stood up and dressed<br/>themselves as they stood over the exhausted<br/>prostitutes that lay across the bed they had used<br/>for most of the night. Their gaze was cold and<br/>firm as they willed their clothing back into a<br/>neat and pressed appearance. It shifted<br/>accordingly and they started towards the door with<br/>a snort.<p>"Heh, they weren't expecting that," said<br/>Carrot calmly as he glanced back at them.<p>"Having the three of us here does have it's<br/>advantages at times," agreed Dan with a short nod.<p>There was a soft whimpering in the back of<br/>their head and they all pushed it out of their<br/>minds.<p>As they walked down the stairs and smirked at<br/>the surprised gasp of the woman who had greeted<br/>them, they stopped and grabbed another girl by her<br/>arm and turned her around. "Hello."<p>Kung stared them in the face with a sort of<br/>dull looking fear. She was dressed as a prostitute<br/>and forced a smile on her face. "This one is<br/>interesting."<p>"Y-yes," stammered the woman in disbelief. The<br/>four girls he had chosen were all experienced,<br/>very experienced. They should have accompanied him<br/>out of the room at the very least. He looked as<br/>fresh as when he'd entered, not even his clothes<br/>were disheveled.<p>"Well, are you going to show me to a room, or<br/>stand there with your mouth open?" said the man as<br/>he grinned at her.<p>"R-right," muttered Kung as she led him<br/>towards the stairs with a carefully concealed<br/>panic on her face. "Shit. Someone would have to<br/>pick me," she thought angrily. Her eyes darted in<br/>the direction she was moving when he'd stopped<br/>her. A small wooden door that supposedly led to<br/>the basement of the building. "What should I do<br/>with this idiot?"<p>She opened the door and led him into the room.<br/>Without a word he closed the door behind them.<br/>Kung whirled around with her leg extended into a<br/>kick aimed for his head. She was hoping for a<br/>quick knock out, but spied a nearby metal<br/>candlestick just in case.<p>Her expression changed to one of fear as she<br/>stared at the man in front of her in horror. He<br/>was standing with her ankle in his hand and<br/>looking at it in annoyance.<p>"Tell me why you're here Miss Kung," he said<br/>calmly.<p>"You know me?" said the woman as she backed<br/>away from him.<p>"I grow tired of saving you Kung, every time I<br/>see you, someone is trying to kill you. You're<br/>either very stupid, or there's something people<br/>don't like about you," said the man as he crossed<br/>his arms in front of his chest.<p>"Who?" she muttered as she backed away. "You!"<br/>Her eyes went wide as she saw his eyes, two<br/>metallic silver orbs stared her down coldly with a<br/>familiar intensity. She pulled a camera from out<br/>of a small handbag she had at her side and took a<br/>picture.<p>"Of course, it could be both," said the man as<br/>he narrowed his eyes at her in irritation.<p>"I've got you now! I know who you really are!"<p>"And I know who you really are, what will you<br/>do if I tell the people down there about you and<br/>your occupation?" he replied calmly.<p>"I might escape," she said as she moved<br/>towards the candlestick.<p>"I'd thought of that," he replied with a<br/>shrug.<p>"This is the biggest story of my life, I've<br/>got a picture of the real you. I can't just give<br/>that up!" she said angrily. "You understand, I've<br/>got to think about my career."<p>"What makes you think I'm stupid enough to<br/>show you the real me Kung?" asked the mirror image<br/>of her that appeared in front of her where the man<br/>had once stood.<p>She gasped and stepped back. "What the? What<br/>the hell are you?"<p>"I'm the Shadow, and I always know," he<br/>replied calmly as he narrowed his eyes at her.<br/>"You're here, stupidly enough, to report on the<br/>illegal operations below this building. However,<br/>you only know about the counterfeiting."<p>"Only?" she muttered dumbly.<p>"You didn't know about the drug lab in the sub<br/>basement, and the fact that you would have been<br/>killed if you had wandered down there dressed that<br/>way. The prostitutes don't work there, and they<br/>aren't allowed near that door. You were making<br/>that Madam down there suspicious."<p>"How do you know?" she muttered halfheartedly.<p>They smirked as Xellos's image faded from<br/>sight. He closed the laptop computer that was<br/>resting in front of them and winked as he finally<br/>vanished.<p>"Do I really have to answer that Miss Kung?"<br/>he said with a smirk on his face.<p>"So these pictures of you are useless," she<br/>muttered irritably as she looked at her camera.<p>He held a roll of film in front of her and<br/>smirked. "I'd still rather people didn't know<br/>about this. I may need to use this alias again one<br/>day."<p>"When did?" she muttered in shock as she<br/>lowered the camera.<p>"In any case, I should make it easily enough,"<br/>said the Shadow as he raised his arm and inspected<br/>the new tattoo that had appeared there. It was<br/>from a local Yakuza faction. "I suggest you leave,<br/>it's going to be rather noisy."<p>"Only if you promise me an interview," she<br/>said calmly.<p>"No," he said calmly as he strolled by.<p>"How about a date then?" she pressed. "Come<br/>on, give me something!"<p>The man paused and looked at her for a moment.<br/>"I imagine it would be virtually the same thing."<p>She blushed and turned away. "So?"<p>"I'll think about it," he replied with a sort<br/>of casual smirk.<p>"Asshole!" she snapped as she stomped her foot<br/>on the ground. He had already left the room.<p>She cussed and walked down the stairs. There<br/>were a few customers mulling about the area with<br/>women on their arms. With a small sigh, she walked<br/>up the Madam and coughed into her hand.<p>The woman turned to face her and frowned. "Who<br/>are you? You're not..."<p>"I suggest you get your girls out of the<br/>building," said Kung calmly.<p>"Why is that?" asked the woman.<p>"Things are about to get messy," said Kung as<br/>she started towards the door. "For someone who<br/>relies on shadows and stealth, he sure is messy."<br/>she thought to herself as she walked into the<br/>street.<p>The woman blinked and looked around at the<br/>women who were now staring at her in confusion.<br/>Her mind went back to the young man who had<br/>entered the building and taken four of her girls<br/>upstairs. She hadn't noticed the tattoo on his<br/>arm, but he had made it past the door unmolested.<br/>She didn't recognize him from anyone else in the<br/>organization..."<p>Finally it hit her and her eyes went wide.<br/>"Oyabun knows!" She whirled around and faced the<br/>girls. "Get everyone out of the rooms now!"<p>++++++++++++++<p>Carrot smirked as they walked up to the<br/>doorway and opened it with a casual arrogance<br/>about them. No one tried to stop them. He did<br/>notice the armed man sitting behind a small corner<br/>that couldn't be seen until you were at the<br/>doorway. He turned and smirked at him as he opened<br/>the door with a sort of cruel ease.<p>The man did nothing, he acted just like any<br/>other of the Oyabun's men would have, and he had<br/>seen the familiar markings on his arm for a<br/>moment. "Dey's all jerks," he muttered under his<br/>breath before returning to his lazy half napping<br/>state again.<p>++++++++++++++<p>The man sitting behind the that sat in front<br/>of the printing press stood up. He looked to be in<br/>his early twenties, and had a good build about<br/>him. He was obviously someone who had moved up<br/>from being muscle for someone smarter. "Who?"<p>"I was sent to check up on things," said the<br/>man who stood before him with a sort of cold ease<br/>about him. His hands were locked behind his back,<br/>and he was dressed in neat looking silk clothes.<p>"Check on what?" asked the man.<p>"Your books, they seemed a bit off recently.<br/>I'm here to check on them, clear up the mistake if<br/>there was one," said the man calmly as he strolled<br/>forward and smirked at him.<p>The man nodded and pulled out a thick looking<br/>paper. "We're putting out the bills required,<br/>we're not making any more than that either. I've<br/>got invoices for all the paper delivered, and the<br/>ink. It's more trouble than it's worth to try to<br/>get my hands on that grade of paper. It'd cost<br/>more than I'd print with it anyway."<p>Ranma leaned over the man's desk and looked at<br/>the pages for a moment. He saw the man's eyes dart<br/>down at his tattoo for a moment and smirked as he<br/>stood up. "Where are the other books, Jiro?"<p>"Other books?" asked the man calmly.<p>"Yes, the books for..." Ranma's foot slammed<br/>into the ground suddenly and the man jumped back.<br/>A hole crumbled away down into the room below them<br/>revealing another room. Several men were working<br/>below at what looked like some sort of chemistry<br/>lab. They were coughing from the dust and<br/>muttering in confusion. "That," finished Ranma as<br/>he pointed down the hole.<p>"Oh shit," muttered the man as he sat back<br/>down and looked at the man standing over him in<br/>horror.<p>"Jiro, the Oyabun doesn't know," said Ranma<br/>calmly as his smirk widened slightly.<p>The man relaxed a great deal and wiped the<br/>sweat from his brow. "Oh kami...you scared the..."<br/>His voice trailed off as he saw something new<br/>standing in front of him.<p>It was a huge man in a black cape. A red scarf<br/>covered his face and a wide brimmed hat rested on<br/>top of his head. "The Oyabun doesn't ever have to<br/>find out about this either. If you turn yourself<br/>over to the police, confess what you've done and<br/>rat your friends out. Or I'll personally deliver<br/>the message to the Oyabun about what you've been<br/>doing. I'll tell him that you endangered his most<br/>successful printing operation because you got<br/>greedy and made a drug lab beneath it. I'll tell<br/>him that I would have ignored it if it wasn't for<br/>the drug lab. Do you want me to tell him that,<br/>Jiro?"<p>The man was staring at the figure in front of<br/>him in terror and shook his head from side to side<br/>violently. "Prison sucks, Jiro, but think of what<br/>the Oyabun will do if he finds out about this.<br/>What will he do to you? What will he do to your<br/>family? What will he do, to torture you before he<br/>kills you?"<p>Jiro was pulling desperately at the handgun in the<br/>drawer now, but it seemed like it was super glued<br/>to the bottom of it. He screamed as he struggled<br/>to budge it.<p>The Shadow chuckled and leaned forward. "Are<br/>you having trouble Jiro? Maybe I can help you."<p>His ears filled with the sound of wood tearing<br/>itself apart as the gun was ripped from his hands<br/>by an unseen force. The thing standing over him<br/>chuckled as it stood upright with his gun in it's<br/>hand.<p>"Now, I suggest you leave, and tell the police<br/>about what you and your friends below have been<br/>doing, before I get impatient," said the thing<br/>coldly.<p>The man screamed and started running as he<br/>stumbled up the stairs.<p>The shadow turned and smirked as he saw a<br/>group of armed men climbing through a trap door in<br/>the floor. They were glaring at him angrily, and<br/>had apparently overheard the conversation he had<br/>just had with their boss. Most of them had a<br/>firearm of some sort in their hands.<p>The Shadow faced them and they all paused<br/>suddenly. He was holding only a lighter in his<br/>hand. They looked at each other in confusion and<br/>started to train their weapons on the man. His<br/>appearance changed suddenly, it was as if he had<br/>suddenly been covered in some sort of liquid<br/>metal. Then the lighter fell from his fingers and<br/>into the lab below.<p>++++++++++++<p>Kung blinked in surprise as a man came out of<br/>the building screaming in terror. He paused only<br/>long enough to turn and continued in a mad search<br/>for the nearest police officer. The whores stood<br/>around her as they watched the building in silence<br/>from across the street. Police sirens started<br/>sounding in the distance and they began to<br/>disperse.<p>"That was relatively painless," muttered Kung<br/>with a small shrug.<p>The madam stood next to her and sighed. "That<br/>was a good job too."<p>They were both knocked off of their feet as<br/>the building exploded in a spectacular ball of<br/>flames.<p>"Whoa!" cried Kung in awe as she shielded her<br/>face from the heat as best she could.<p>Both women managed to stagger to their feet<br/>after a moment and watched as the building burned.<br/>It started to collapse into itself as the flames<br/>reached higher and higher. They both watched in a<br/>sort of horrified awe as a figure walked from the<br/>flames. he seemed to reflect the light as if<br/>covered in a sort of metallic armor. It slowly<br/>melted away, revealing a huge man dressed in<br/>black. He looked at them for a moment and then<br/>jumped away, vanishing onto the rooftops and into<br/>the shadows.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Jadeite cursed as he jumped down and dodged<br/>the umbrella that passed over his head from the<br/>rooftop. He landed in the alleyway and chuckled to<br/>himself as he found himself cornered.<p>"You won't get away!" cried Sailor Moon as she<br/>appeared at the front of the alley.<p>"We have you!" snarled Ryoga as he landed just<br/>in front of her.<p>"Fools, haven't you learned you can't trap me<br/>by now?" snarled Jadeite as he vanished in another<br/>flash of light.<p>"Damn! How does he do that?" snarled Ryoga as<br/>he stood upright and stared at the spot where the<br/>boy had vanished.<p>"You...saved me again," said Usagi as she<br/>turned to face him with a gentle smile on her<br/>face.<p>"Yeah, I guess," he muttered as he turned away<br/>from her.<p>The girl frowned slightly at his reaction and<br/>sighed. "Do...I bother you Ryoga?"<p>"Huh? No! That's not it at all! I mean..." he<br/>blushed and stepped back a little. "It's just<br/>that..."<p>"What? You can tell me!" said the girl as she<br/>moved towards him.<p>"It's nothing. I should get going," said the<br/>boy as he started walking towards the dead end.<p>"Wouldn't going out this way be easier than<br/>climbing high enough to jump onto the roof again?"<br/>asked Usagi in confusion.<p>"Huh?" Ryoga blushed as he realized she was<br/>right. He struggled for a moment and came up with<br/>an explanation. "I forgot my umbrella up there."<p>"Wait here!" she said with a grin forming on<br/>her face as she jumped up and stopped suddenly as<br/>her ribbons grabbed the walls on either side. The<br/>started to move like the arms of a giant spider<br/>and she climbed the rest of the way up. After a<br/>moment of glancing around, she spotted her target<br/>and rushed over, picking it up into her arms.<p>Ryoga blinked as she came back down and handed<br/>it to her. "Thanks."<p>"You should thank me," she said as she leaned<br/>in and smirked at him. She puckered her lips and<br/>closed her eyes.<p>Ryoga froze and stared at her dumbly. "I<br/>can't! I mean...Akane...Akari...I...Forgive me!"<br/>Finally he closed his eyes and leaned forward,<br/>meeting the girl's lips.<p>Sailor Moon pushed into him, clutching his<br/>shoulders and forcing him to be more aggressive.<br/>She broke the kiss and smiled at him again. "It's<br/>cute that you're so shy, but you don't have to<br/>be."<p>He staggered back and turned away from her. "I<br/>should go."<p>"So should I," she admitted with a slight<br/>disappointment in her voice.<p>"Goodbye," the muttered in unison. They<br/>blushed and turned away from one another before<br/>going their separate ways.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ryoga found himself brooding again, he'd been<br/>doing a lot of that since he met Sailor Moon. He<br/>always seemed to just stumble across her at just<br/>the right time. Right when she needed help. "Damn,<br/>I've never been able to find someone this much.<br/>Not that I've been looking..." He frowned, he knew<br/>he'd actually started seeking her out lately.<br/>"This is strange, I think I love her. Akari and<br/>Akane, but...Damn. He growled and turned his head<br/>in disgust with himself. "I'm such a bastard, I'm<br/>no better than Ranma, or Kuno. How could a girl<br/>like that care about a guy who's a pig anyway?"<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma lay in his bed staring at the ceiling.<br/>Occasionally, they'd wipe another tear off their<br/>face as Xianfu's crying continued. She hadn't said<br/>much since they'd entered the whorehouse. There<br/>was no other expression on the face though.<p>They were in relative silence, until it was<br/>finally broken by Pissant. "Maybe we went too<br/>far..."<p>"No!" was the unanimous reply from all three<br/>of the others.<p>"But..." muttered the gentle voice guiltily.<p>"If she tries something like that again, the<br/>next time I'm gonna find me one of those bondage<br/>holes, and we'll keep going every night for a<br/>week!"<p>"We almost killed Yusaku," said Pissant in<br/>irritation.<p>"He deserved it," snorted Ranma angrily.<p>"I don't like him much, but I'm not so sure of<br/>that," said Carrot begrudgingly.<p>"What do ya mean?" snorted Dan.<p>"We've known he's had the hots for us for some<br/>time now. Horny the happy here might have used<br/>that. I won't kill him for it unless he tries to<br/>do it again. I sure as hell ain't apologizing for<br/>what we already did either."<p>"That seems unlike you," muttered Pissant.<p>"Even I can't be a bastard all the time, that<br/>takes all of us," said Carrot with a small snort.<p>"Yeah. I hate us more and more every day,"<br/>agreed Dan.<p>"We can't go on like this, we've got to think<br/>of something," said Pissant. "It isn't fair to<br/>her."<p>There was a pause in Xianfu's sniffling, and<br/>complete silence.<p>"There ain't much we can do," said Dan. "I<br/>ain't willin to give up women, and I ain't willin<br/>to compromise on fuckin men. It sucks to be her,<br/>but there are more of us guys in here."<p>"He's right. As much as it sucks, this is a<br/>case where the needs of the many outweigh the<br/>needs of the few," agreed Carrot.<p>"What do we do then?" asked Pissant. "I wish<br/>there was a way too..."<p>Carrot shushed him suddenly as they sat up in<br/>bed with an unusual expression on their faces. "I<br/>can't believe I never thought of this before."<p>"What's up?" asked Dan in confusion.<br/>"I think I may have at least a partial<br/>solution to our problem," said Carrot. "I'm not<br/>sure if it'll work though, but there's no reason<br/>not to try."<p>"I'm listenin," said Ranma as he made them<br/>frown in thought.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"So, what do we do?" asked Dan as he stood in<br/>the middle of the empty lot in front of them. It<br/>was late at night and the ground they'd chosen was<br/>surrounded by a fence on every side. There was a<br/>little grass, and a few small piles of junk, but<br/>it was mostly clear.<p>"This isn't going to be easy, but it just<br/>might work," said Carrot as he spread their feet<br/>apart and pulled their fists up at their sides.<p>They began to glow with power, and a strained<br/>look appeared on their faces. Slowly, the glow<br/>died down as their concentration deepened.<p>"Keep it going," said Carrot to them all.<p>"I don't feel anything," said Ranma in<br/>frustration.<p>"How many times can we do something the first<br/>time we try?" asked Xianfu.<p>"Not very often," he admitted with anger clear<br/>in his voice.<p>"Dang," said Dan irritably. "We should try<br/>again tomorrow."<p>"Well, it worked this time," said Pissant<br/>lazily.<p>"Huh?" said everyone dumbly.<p>"You idiots don't even realize you're not<br/>talking to each other inside our head anymore do<br/>you?"<p>Everyone opened their eyes and saw two other<br/>Yohiko Hibiki's staring back at them.<p>"It worked?" muttered Ranma dumbly.<p>"Yeah," said Dan as he looked at the other two<br/>in a sort of awe.<p>"We're free?" said Xianfu in a sort of amazed<br/>shock.<p>"Don't get ahead of yourself. We don't know<br/>how long this lasts," said Carrot firmly.<p>"Where did you learn this technique?" said<br/>Ranma as he tried to think back.<p>"Dragon Ball," replied Carrot.<p>"Dragon Ball?" muttered Dan dumbly.<p>"Well, every other technique we've tried from<br/>that show has worked so far," replied Carrot with<br/>a shrug.<p>"Wait. Why are there only three of us?" asked<br/>Xianfu in confusion as she glanced around.<p>Dan snorted as he shifted to a male body.<br/>"I've got Pissboy right now. He said something<br/>about not being strong enough to handle his own<br/>body. He's the only one of us who can't move the<br/>body on his own, so it makes sense I guess."<p>Carrot shifted to a male body as well before<br/>he spoke. "Right, and Ranma and I are permanently<br/>joined, because of what Hild did to us to make us<br/>a hellspawn, and a demon," said Carrot with a<br/>shrug. "We couldn't separate if we wanted to."<p>"Huh?" said the Xianfu in confusion.<p>"Didn't you notice that Ranma and I always act<br/>as a pair? I get hungry, so does he, we sleep on<br/>the same schedule. Things like that, Ranma and I<br/>are closer to one being than two, because of Hild.<br/>We figured it out a while back, that's part of how<br/>we were able to distance ourselves from you while<br/>we were gathering power to become the Lord of<br/>Nightmares."<p>"Right, back when you had Xellos running<br/>around on Earth stealing the crystal and raising<br/>Metallia," said Dan as he remembered it.<p>"Yeah, something like that," said Carrot.<p>"You realize what this means? Even if it only<br/>lasts a few hours or so, we can..." started Xianfu<br/>with a joyous look on her face.<p>"Finally get some payback," said Dan with a<br/>smirk on his face.<p>"I was thinking the same thing," agreed<br/>Carrot.<p>Xianfu blinked and looked at the other two for<br/>a moment. "Huh?"<p>"Xianfu! Dan! Prepare to die!" screamed Carrot<br/>as he dove for them.<p>"Fat chance loser boy!" snarled Dan as he met<br/>the charge head on.<p>Xianfu was trapped in the middle.<br/>"YAAAAAAAAAAAH! You bastards! I'll kill you both<br/>for this!" She screamed as she managed to regain<br/>her footing after they both slammed into her sides<br/>at full force.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Dan was looking up at the stars, they had been<br/>at it for the past two and a half hours now. For<br/>the past half-hour or so, he was simply lying on<br/>his back looking at the sky.<p>Xianfu and Carrot were still making quite a<br/>bit of noise as they struggled with one another in<br/>the dirt a short distance away.<p>"Mr. Dan...Ummm...why did we stop?" asked<br/>Pissant.<p>"Because I got tired of beating on them for a<br/>little while," replied Dan angrily.<p>"Not because she hit us in our..." said the<br/>voice fearfully.<p>"Well, that too. She's pretty strong,"<br/>muttered Dan painfully as he put his hand on his<br/>crotch and felt it throb in pain for a moment.<p>"Maybe we should get some ice? I mean, Carrot,<br/>Ranma, and Xianfu are still fighting..." said the<br/>voice nervously.<p>"Those three stopped fighting a half hour<br/>ago," said Dan irritably. "I'd leave, but I'm<br/>afraid to stand up."<p>"They did? Then what's that noise?" said<br/>Pissant obliviously.<p>"Somethin we're better off not lookin at,"<br/>said Dan as he purposely turned his head in the<br/>other direction.<p>Pissant blushed badly and gasped. "Oh my!"<p>"Hey, it's been what? Two thousand years or<br/>somethin like that for her? Did ya think that one<br/>time would be enough?" snorted Dan irritably.<p>The noise to his right stopped suddenly and he<br/>waited a minute or two before turning his head and<br/>looking at the pair as they both remained sprawled<br/>out on the ground growling at each other<br/>painfully.<p>"Bitch," grumbled Carrot.<p>"Dick," snarled Xianfu.<p>"You two finished yet?" said Dan irritably.<p>"Shut up!" the cried as they sat up.<p>"I hate you," muttered Carrot angrily as he<br/>narrowed his eyes at Xianfu as she casually pinned<br/>her hair behind her bed messily.<p>Her arm shot out in a right hook that slammed<br/>across his jaw and she went back to fixing her<br/>hair. "Tough."<p>"Can we go home now?" said Dan flatly as he<br/>slowly stood up.<p>Xianfu smirked as she noticed he was a little<br/>bowlegged still.<p>"Laugh it up bitch," snarled Dan.<p>"Well, damn," said Carrot as he looked down at<br/>his hand. It was starting to fade away as his<br/>exhaustion finally caught up with him.<p>"What's it been?" said Dan as he noticed the<br/>same thing.<p>"About two and a half hours," said Xianfu as<br/>she turned away from them.<p>"Well, we were using up a lot of energy<br/>fighting as well, we could probably go three or<br/>four if we weren't doing that. Plus we need to<br/>figure out a range we can go as well." said Carrot<br/>as he calmly allowed his body to dissipate. The<br/>world went gray, and then refocused from another<br/>perspective.<p>"Everybody here?" asked Ranma.<p>There was a collective muttering from within<br/>them and they stood up painfully. They promptly<br/>collapsed onto the ground again.<p>"I wasn't hurt this bad!" muttered Dan in<br/>pain.<p>"Our injuries are compounded," grumbled Xianfu<br/>as she gasped for breath.<p>"Man, that was really stupid," muttered<br/>Carrot.<p>"Are we going to miss work again?" whined<br/>Pissant.<p>"Yes," said everyone else hatefully.<p>"We need to test this out tomorrow. For god's<br/>sake, no fighting!" snapped Carrot. "We need to<br/>know our limits before we can screw around like<br/>this again."<p>"Yeah, no fuckin either," said Dan with a<br/>small snort. "That goes fer all of us."<p>"Fine," agreed the others.<p>"We'll separate right away, and start walking.<br/>I'd like to know if this has some sort of distance<br/>range as well," added Carrot.<p>"After that, we'll stay home and see how long<br/>it takes after we use this up for us to be able to<br/>do it again," said Ranma.<p>"That's a good idea too," agreed Carrot.<p>"Even if we can only do it for three hours a<br/>day," said Xianfu cheerfully. "This will solve<br/>everything!"<p>"Yeah right," muttered Carrot lamely. "Since<br/>when have our problems been this easy to fix?"<p>"Still," said the woman cheerfully.<p>"Maybe we can make it last longer with<br/>practice?" said Ranma.<p>"Maybe, but I don't think we'll ever be able<br/>to hold it more than a few hours at most. I don't<br/>think we'd let us do it for more than that,"<br/>warned Carrot. "Don't get your hopes up."<p>They struggled to their feet, and started<br/>walking back towards their home again. For the<br/>first time in days, their spirit was somewhat high<br/>on the whole.<p>Carrot and Ranma were having a conversation of<br/>their own though.<p>"Why didn't you let me?" snarled Ranma.<p>"You saw what happened when we went back to<br/>normal," said Carrot calmly. "I was being careful<br/>and it paid off."<p>"So I can't kill her?" asked Ranma angrily.<p>"No," said Carrot firmly. "It could kill us<br/>all if you do, and we'd just end up back together<br/>when we died. Don't forget that."<p>"So, I'll bet we can do this as long as we<br/>like after that," said Ranma.<p>"No. You're wrong. One of the reasons I wanted<br/>to try this, besides the obvious of course, is<br/>that we'd only let ourselves do it here, if we<br/>couldn't do it as L-sama."<p>"Can't do? I thought we were all powerful or<br/>something?" said Ranma.<p>"Maybe we are, as a collective," said Carrot.<br/>"We don't know what could happen if we separated.<br/>It could be really messy to the universe as a<br/>whole. Or maybe we do know what would happen,"<br/>said Carrot, "and that's why we won't."<p>Ranma growled under his breath and sighed.<br/>"So, I can't ever kill her."<p>"Not unless you're willing to give everything<br/>else up on this world," said Carrot with a shrug.<br/>"Besides, she wasn't all that bad after..."<p>"So," muttered Ranma in embarrassment.<p>"We'll worry about it later," replied Carrot<br/>with a shrug.<p>"Yeah, later," grumbled Ranma lamely.<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Return To Nerima!<p>
