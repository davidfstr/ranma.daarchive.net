</div>Insertion<p>Part 4<p>Dream a little dream...<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome stared in horror at the man he used to be. Both Dan<br/>and Carrot stood behind him, stifling giggles as they watched the<br/>scene in amusement.<p>"Aye! I've come to meet me bride!" said Genaku rather loudly as he<br/>walked through the hallways of the palace. He was followed by a large<br/>group of guards, who did not even attempt to stop him. Most of them<br/>had worried looks on their faces as they moved after him.<p>"Everyone is scared of this guy," commented Carrot as he followed<br/>the crowd with his two companions.<p>"I like him," said Dan cheerfully.<p>"You would!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Shhh, something's happening," said Carrot with a grin forming on<br/>his face.<p>Setsuna appeared around a corner, scowling at Genaku coolly. "What<br/>are you doing here?"<p>"Eh? Ye dunna know?" snorted the man with mild surprise on his<br/>face.<p>"I am not omnipotent, you blowhard," snorted the Senshi of Pluto.<p>"Humph, I figured you ta be buttin in on everyone's business, the<br/>way ye always do," replied Genaku with an unimpressed look on his<br/>face.<p>"I am the defender of the future," said the woman calmly.<p>"Ha! Manipulator is more like it! I've no respect for ye woman! I<br/>do not cower before any force, like these weak fools," snorted Genaku<br/>arrogantly. "Humanity survived long before ye ever got yer little<br/>claws on that magic, and he will continue ta do so without yer help."<p>"Perhaps, but I can ensure the peace that we have achieved will<br/>come again, even after it is lost."<p>"But you canna stop us from losin it can ye?"<p>Pluto's eyebrow twitched, but she did not reply.<p>"Har! I knew ye was jest blowin steam out yer arse!" snorted the<br/>man roughly as he continued to walk towards the throne room.<p>"You still haven't told me where you're going," said Pluto, her<br/>voice as cold as ice.<p>"Nor do I intend ta," said the man as he rounded a corner.<p>Pluto clenched her fist and glared at him, seething in anger.<br/>"Don't just stand there you dolts, go after him!" she snarled at the<br/>dumbfounded guards.<p>Genaku had been a thorn in her side for as long as she could<br/>remember, and probably would be for some time to come. After all, he<br/>was as immortal as she was. She just wished the morons would finish<br/>their stupid 'game' so they would finally lose their immortality. Some<br/>of them were almost as bad as Genaku, but he was probably the worst of<br/>them. Even the ones, who sided with the dark powers, still didn't get<br/>under her skin the way he could.<p>"I'll deal with that moron later," she snorted as she turned and<br/>went back about her business. "I wonder what the queen has summoned me<br/>for? I suppose I shall find out soon enough. Probably something<br/>stupid, like when the princess's first pimple will be again." Serenity<br/>was a great ruler, and a wise and strong person, but some things she<br/>couldn't quite grasp. Like the fact that the time gate was not<br/>intended for small and personal events. Such as how old her daughter<br/>will be when she has her first period. Setsuna had never seen anyone<br/>turn that red in her life, after her mother had asked that question in<br/>front of the whole court, the princess had almost passed out. It<br/>probably would have been better if she had really.<p>+++++++++<p>"I like this guy!" said Carrot as he watched Genaku ignore the<br/>pleading of a minor court official.<p>The unfortunate man was begging him to hurry to the throne room,<br/>in order to have his audience with the Queen. After all, she was<br/>waiting for him.<p>Genaku looked up at him for a moment, and grunted. He had decided<br/>to raid the kitchen, and was sitting at a table with a huge leg of<br/>meat in his hands, along with a large mug of some obviously alcoholic<br/>beverage of some kind. Carrot and Dan would have guessed it was Ale or<br/>Beer. It appeared to be a swirling green and purple though.<p>"Go away little man, before I become angry with ye!" he snorted<br/>and continued to tear into the meat.<p>"I thought I might find you in here," said a familiar voice from<br/>behind both of them.<p>"Uh-oh," said both Genaku and the old man in unison.<p>"Ducking my summons in favor of food again?" said Serenity as she<br/>sat down next to the pair with a mischievous looking sparkle in her<br/>eyes.<p>"Well, I can't come ta meet ye on an empty stomach yer highness.<br/>Yer beauty alone gives me butterflies. You know how those things upset<br/>my delicate constitution..."<p>"This from a man who is reported to have taken out a man's heart<br/>and eaten it whole?" said Serenity with an arched eyebrow.<p>"Well, that report was exaggerated a wee bit, Highness," muttered<br/>the man in embarrassment.<p>"Oh really?" said the queen as she leaned in towards him.<p>"Aye, 'twas too big ta fit in me mouth whole. I had ta take a few<br/>bites first," said the man cheerfully.<p>"Oh," said Serenity blankly. She had been expecting him to deny<br/>the affair, and hadn't really believed the report when she had heard<br/>it.<p>"So, ye have arranged a meeting with my future bride today?" he<br/>asked timidly.<p>"Yes," said the Queen as she stood up and motioned for him to<br/>follow.<p>The pair walked through the hallway together silently. After a<br/>moment, they entered the throne room. Setsuna was sitting in a chair<br/>off to the side looking rather bored, and strangely upset. Genaku<br/>caught something about not believing that something was happening to<br/>her.<p>Then she paused and stared at him.<p>"What? Her?" said Genaku with a rough snort.<p>"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!" screamed Pluto. "You...you can't do this to me!"<br/>she pleaded as she fell on her knees in front of the queen.<p>"Oh! How nice, you already know each other?"<p>"He blew up my moon!" snarled Pluto as she stood up and jabbed her<br/>finger at him.<p>"It was jest a teeny thing though..." he muttered.<p>"It was the only one I had!" snapped the Senshi bitterly.<p>"I jest got a wee bit excited, 'twas all," muttered the man as he<br/>blushed.<p>"What did I do? Why am I being punished?" said Pluto as she fell<br/>to her knees in front of the queen again. "I swear I'll never do it<br/>again!"<p>"Punished? You two seem like you might be good together, that's<br/>all," said Serenity sweetly.<p>"Good?" muttered Genaku under his breath.<p>"No! We'd be terrible! I hate him! Look! I've even been trying to<br/>kill him in secret for the last hundred years!" Pluto brought out a<br/>large stack of rather elaborate looking diagrams, charts, and<br/>blueprints. All of them seemed to involve sabotage, or somehow<br/>beheading someone and making it look like an accident of some kind.<p>"Har! I knew it!" said Genaku proudly. He looked rather pleased<br/>with himself. "Too many accidents over the last few years!"<p>"Oh, I'm sure you'll get along fine," said Serenity as she turned<br/>and walked towards her throne. "The wedding will be in two weeks."<p>The now engaged pair simply looked at her, unable to do or say<br/>anything.<p>+++++++++<p>"This is all your fault!" snarled Pluto as she stormed down the<br/>hall with Genaku at her side.<p>"My fault?" he said in disgust. "Twasn't! I had nuthin ta do with<br/>this plot against me!"<p>"Against you? She's doing this to punish me!" snarled Pluto in<br/>retort.<p>"Look," said Genaku with a frown. "We both know why she's doing<br/>this ta us. She loves weddings, and will do anything ta have one.<br/>There's no way we're gettin out o' this."<p>"You're right," said Pluto as she slumped down against the wall.<br/>"We'll go through with this, and then go on as we always have. I never<br/>had any plans to get married anyway."<p>"Aye, I know," said Genaku as he turned away.<p>"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" snarled Pluto.<p>"Isn't it obvious? A frigid bitch such as yerself could never net<br/>her claws inta a decent man anyway," said the man coolly.<p>"I'll have you know I could have any man in the solar system if I<br/>wanted him!" she snarled. "I know I'm beautiful!"<p>"Ya look like you've been standing too close ta Sol, you half<br/>baked ninny."<p>"It's an exotic tan you nimrod! I get plenty of compliments!"<br/>snapped Pluto in retort.<p>"Whatever, but you're forgetting one thing, pet," said Genaku as<br/>he turned away from her.<p>"I never forget anything," said Pluto bitterly as she glared at<br/>him.<p>"Oh, then ya do remember?" said the man with a small chuckle.<p>"Remember what?" said Pluto with her head turned aside.<p>"That the only thing Serenity loves more than weddings, is<br/>babies," said the man as he continued to walk away, chuckling to<br/>himself.<p>Setsuna stood in the hallway, completely pale, with her jaw<br/>hanging down. She staggered for a moment and leaned against the wall<br/>again, her eyes wide with horror.<p>Genaku was right; Serenity would expect her to produce, or else.<br/>The queen would know that both of them were genetically compatible.<br/>Children were just a matter of time, especially considering the<br/>technology Mercury had. They had drugs that would make her fertile<br/>periods predictable, to within five minutes.<p>+++++++++<p>Genaku walked out of the palace and paused as a long scream echoed<br/>through the hallways for a moment. Flocks of birds scattered into the<br/>air from within the palace walls.<p>He turned back towards the large transport that would take him<br/>back to the Silver Star, the flagship of the queen's fleet.<p>"General! Are you ready to leave sir?" said one of the men beside<br/>the docking ramp.<p>"Aye," said Genaku with a small chuckle as he passed by him and<br/>returned the man's salute.<p>++++++++<p>A freezing cold splash of water ended the dream quite suddenly.<p>All parties suddenly sat upright at one time and looked at Genma<br/>Saotome as he stood over them with an empty bucket.<p>"Ye fat furball! I'll tear out ye hide and use it ta cover the<br/>hole in me wall I get from putting yer head through it!" snarled Ranma<br/>as he jumped up and slammed the man out the window and into the koi<br/>pond.<p>Ranma froze in shocked horror and put his hands over his mouth.<p>"Ha-ha! That was classic!" said Carrot as he shook the water out<br/>of their hair and chuckled merrily.<p>"I had no idea you were so cultured, Saotome," agreed Dan<br/>cheerfully.<p>"You two jerks shut the hell up!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Come on, we've got to get ready for school," muttered Carrot as<br/>he walked them towards their closet.<p>++++++++++<p>Nabiki watched lazily as Genma fell out of the sky and landed in<br/>the koi pond. "Yet another normal morning," she commented as the panda<br/>sat up, looking confused.<p>"Son?" said the sign it held up, as it looked up at the window of<br/>the bedroom it had been thrown from.<p>"Here I come Pop! Get ready!" said Ranma as he leapt from the<br/>window.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Pardon me good sir, but where might I find a place called<br/>Furinkan High School?"<p>"Pardon?" said the man walking down the middle of a rather<br/>deserted and worn looking road in the countryside of Japan.<p>"I'm looking for this place you see. I've gotten rather lost,"<br/>said the stuffy looking teenager who stood in front of the downtrodden<br/>looking peasant.<p>The man looked at the map of Tokyo in the boy's hands and frowned.<br/>"This is Tokyo, that's five hundred miles north o' here."<p>"Oh! Oh my! Bother," muttered the boy as he walked off, in exactly<br/>the wrong direction.<p>"No! That way!" said the man angrily. "That way!"<p>"It's this way then?" said Ryoga as he turned at a ninety-degree<br/>angle, still moving in the wrong direction.<p>+++++++++<p>Ranma was in the middle of a rather deep problem.<p>"Tell me why it is I must give to you?" snapped Kuno angrily.<p>"Oh man, this part," muttered Ranma under his breath as he rolled<br/>his eyes. "What do you mean, Kuno?" The boy said it as if he was<br/>reading lines off a cue card.<p>"Quoth Nabiki Tendo, 'If you wish to give your gift to the<br/>pigtailed girl, give to Ranma Saotome."<p>"She doesn't like you Kuno," said Ranma flatly.<p>"Lies! What sort of woman would not be attracted to such manly<br/>continence as myself?"<p>"A lesbian?" offered Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"I shall not allow you to spread such lies about my pigtailed<br/>goddess!" roared the kendoist angrily.<p>"All right! Jeeze! She thinks you're too stuffy, she doesn't like<br/>handsome rich types," said Ranma calmly.<p>"So, my money and power frighten the young flower of my heart?"<br/>said Kuno with his eyes growing wide.<p>"Yeah! That's it exactl..." Ranma was cut off by a splash of cold<br/>water from the bushes.<p>"Oh! How I have pined to see you again!" said Kuno as he grabbed<br/>the currently female teen in a rough hug. "My ponytailed goddess!"<p>"Look you jerk! Leeme alone!" snapped the ponytailed girl as she<br/>glared at him angrily from his grip.<p>"Come! We shall leave these hallowed halls of learning, so that we<br/>might date together!" said Kuno as he ignored her protests.<p>"Look, Kuno..." said the girl with a seething anger in her voice.<p>Nabiki appeared from behind the bushes with a teakettle. "Oh<br/>Ranma, what am I going to do with you!" she said merrily as she<br/>poured it over the girl's head, changing her back into a man in Kuno's<br/>arms.<p>"What have you done with the ponytailed goddess?" snarled Kuno<br/>angrily as he looked at Ranma.<p>"We're going to have to explain this to him," said Nabiki in<br/>disbelief. "Look Kuno babe, her body, her s..." she was cut off as<br/>Ranma put his hand over her mouth.<p>"I don't need your help, thanks," he said with a small wink. He<br/>grabbed Kuno by his collar and began to drag him away.<p>"Unhand me knave!" roared the boy.<p>"Shut up, I'm going to tell you all about the 'ponytailed girl',"<br/>said Ranma calmly.<p>Nabiki narrowed her eyes and watched him take the boy away to a<br/>quiet<br/>corner of the school grounds.<p>++++++++++<p>"What is the meaning of this?" ranted Kuno as he struggled against<br/>the ropes that tied him to a tree trunk. "Release me at once!"<p>"Just relax, I'm going to explain everything to you now, this is<br/>just to make sure you behave, and pay attention," said Ranma<br/>cheerfully. The boy put down a bucket of water, and a teakettle on<br/>either side of himself and reached into his pocket.<p>"What is this?" said Kuno as the boy attached something to the<br/>ropes. It had a long string tied to it that led into Ranma's hand.<p>"A hand grenade," said Ranma calmly as he sat down.<p>"What?" muttered Kuno as he suddenly went very still.<p>"Good, I've got your attention," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"This will not go unpunished," snarled Kuno as he nervously eyed<br/>the explosive that hung in front of his chest.<p>"Calm down Kuno, no amount of 'prowess' will save your sorry ass<br/>if I pull that pin," said Ranma with a small wave of his hand. "This<br/>is for your own good. Just pay attention and listen, and I won't have<br/>to hurt you."<p>"I see," said Kuno with an unusual calm.<p>"All right, now watch very closely." Ranma poured a little of the<br/>water over his head and shifted forms.<p>"Ponytailed girl!" said Kuno in shock.<p>"Yup! Now watch again, don't blink now," said the girl with a<br/>small wink. She used the kettle next, shifting back to male form.<p>"What sorcery is this?" gasped Kuno as he struggled against the<br/>ropes. "Return the ponytailed goddess to me at once!"<p>"Ah, ah, ah!" said Ranma as he waved his finger and tugged on the<br/>string lightly.<p>Kuno froze and fell silent again.<p>"Good, I'm glad you remembered."<p>"Explain," said Kuno as he turned his head away.<p>"Fine! It all started when I was training in China..."<p>++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo stood in terror stricken silence as she watched Ranma<br/>play with the string attached to Kuno's chest. He had an almost casual<br/>air about him. "Where the hell did he get that?" she gasped after a<br/>moment. She was afraid to move out of her cover, the bushes kept her<br/>well hidden, but she now felt she was far too close to the scene. The<br/>camera she had brought sat unused in her grip, for fear of alerting<br/>the insane Ranma of her presence. She simply sat, and watched.<p>++++++++<p>"So, you fell into this cursed spring, and forced the soul of the<br/>lovely ponytailed girl into your black heart?" snarled Kuno angrily.<p>"No Kuno, she doesn't have a soul," said Ranma. It was clear that<br/>he was growing tired of explaining this to him.<p>"No, soul?" said the boy in a sort of horrified wonder.<p>"Kuno, we aren't two different people, both the ponytailed girl,<br/>and myself are the same. There is no difference," said Ranma with a<br/>heavy sigh. "Get it?"<p>"So you use base sorcery to fool me, so that you can breech my<br/>defenses and fell me while I am weak?" snarled Kuno.<p>"God! Are you that stupid? I'm trying to help you!" said Ranma<br/>flatly.<p>"What do you mean? How does this assist me?" growled Kuno as he<br/>lowered his eyes to the grenade.<p>"Because, I can't have you chasing me around telling me that you<br/>love me, get it? What would everyone think? A man of your noble<br/>stature, chasing around a man? It wouldn't be right!"<p>"You speak the truth," admitted Kuno quietly. It was clear he<br/>didn't like the idea.<p>"Good, you're getting it now. I'm not gay, so I don't want you<br/>chasing after me. Plus, if anyone found out about my curse, your clan<br/>would be dishonored. So if you understand, it benefits us both," said<br/>Ranma with a friendly smile on his face.<p>"This does not excuse you from forcing yourself upon Akane Tendo!"<br/>said Kuno as he glared at the boy angrily.<p>"Fine, fine," said Ranma as he waved the comment off and removed<br/>the grenade, much to the protest of one of the voices within his head.<p>"So, you admit that your actions are cowardly?" snorted Kuno.<p>"Look, you can have Akane Tendo, I don't love her," said Ranma<br/>calmly.<p>"Yet you still?" snarled Kuno as he attempted to jump up again.<p>"Do I have to use the grenade again?" said Ranma flatly. The same<br/>voice cried out triumphantly inside his head.<p>"That will not be necessary," grumbled Kuno as he turned his head<br/>away.<p>"Look, the engagement to Akane isn't my idea. If you've got a<br/>problem with it, go talk to Soun Tendo and Genma Saotome. They're the<br/>ones who arranged everything. My hands are tied," said Ranma flatly.<p>"You claim that you have no feelings for Akane Tendo?" said Kuno<br/>as he glared at the boy.<p>"She's a nice girl, but not my type. My dream woman has long green<br/>hair, and red eyes..." Ranma sighed wistfully as two of the three<br/>voices inside his head pictured Setsuna.<p>Kuno frowned and realized that Ranma looked ridiculously like a<br/>love stricken schoolgirl at the moment. "Surely a lie! No man can<br/>resist the allure of Akane Tendo's feminine wiles!"<p>"Are you sure we're talking about the same Akane?" muttered Ranma<br/>as he looked at Kuno dumbly.<p>"Silence! Release me at once! I shall smite you for having such<br/>thoughts about my beloved!"<p>"Fine, I guess that was a bit too much to hope for," muttered<br/>Ranma as he knocked Kuno upside his head and untied the ropes. The<br/>kendoist slumped to the ground unconscious. "It'll be kinda fun<br/>beating on him every day I suppose." He stood up and smirked at a<br/>patch of bushes off to the side. "You can come out now."<p>Nabiki froze, she swallowed and looked around, desperately hoping<br/>there was someone else hiding in the bushes.<p>"Look, I know you're in there Nabiki. Relax, I'm not gonna hurt<br/>ya," said the boy calmly as he walked over and stood directly in front<br/>of her.<p>Nabiki stood up and glared at Ranma angrily. "What did you do to<br/>him?"<p>"Huh? He's fine, relax would ya?" said Ranma with a small chuckle.<br/>"This is just something I picked up in China. Nothing to worry about,<br/>I wouldn't waste it that way anyway. They're pretty expensive." He<br/>tossed the grenade in his hand once, and then slipped it into his<br/>sleeve.<p>"And illegal," said Nabiki with a small cold frown.<p>"So is loan sharking, racketeering, and selling pornographic<br/>photos of your sister without her knowledge," said Ranma with a small<br/>chuckle as he showed her several snapshots of Akane working out in<br/>the dojo. He tossed them on the ground casually at her feet.<p>"Those are hardly pornographic," said Nabiki coolly.<p>"Yeah, Kuno's too stupid to risk selling the good photos too.<br/>You're very selective about who you will give those pics too. I've<br/>seen a few of em hidden inside the palms of some of the boys around<br/>campus, or tucked inside the back of a locker or two." Ranma casually<br/>flicked his ponytail over his shoulder and smirked. "I'm kinda partial<br/>to the 'Akane in the bath' series myself. It's a wonder no one ever<br/>took pictures like that of you...oops!" Ranma put his hand to his<br/>cheek and looked at the ground for a moment.<p>Nabiki looked at the ground as well, hidden within the photos of<br/>Akane, was a single picture of her washing off on the stool in the<br/>bathroom. "No way!" she gasped.<p>"Yeah, it'd be a real shame if these got around the school<br/>somehow," said Ranma as he walked off and left her standing with the<br/>unconscious Kuno, and the photos. He paused about ten feet away and<br/>looked over his shoulder again. "I wonder what she would do, if she<br/>ever found out about those pictures? Hmm, an interesting dilemma.<br/>Don't worry, I don't mind the ones of me you've been selling, but I<br/>expect a cut of the money. Word around school puts em at around five<br/>thousand yen apiece. I'll expect a payment of ten percent, by<br/>tomorrow. Bye!"<p>Nabiki had never felt so violated, she wanted to destroy him, she<br/>wanted to scream, she wanted to cry, she wanted...to marry him. She<br/>smiled to herself and picked up the pictures carefully. "And here I<br/>thought you'd be some boring jock. Very interesting Ranma Saotome,<br/>very interesting indeed."<p>+++++++++++<p>"I told you those photos would pay off in the end," said Carrot.<p>Ranma was still sulking. The whole episode didn't sit well with<br/>him, he hated the way things were going. "It isn't right! This isn't<br/>the way a martial artist should act!"<p>"Well, I'm no martial artist, not by choice anyway," snorted Dan<br/>irritably. "I still say we should have killed him."<p>"We can't slack off in our training, we've got a whole mess of<br/>shit coming down on us soon," said Carrot with a sort of wistful calm<br/>about him. "We need him, and his stupid battles to keep us sharp. I<br/>just wanted him to quit hitting on us."<p>"This is dishonorable!" continued Ranma with a bitter trembling in<br/>his voice.<p>"Shut up! Damn you honor boy! I'm sick of your whining! What would<br/>you know about honor? Do you realize what kind of man your father is?<br/>I bet he's the one who taught you about honor, right? Do as I say, and<br/>not as I do or something?" said Carrot sharply.<p>"This isn't right," said Ranma firmly.<p>"Fine, you worry about right, I'll worry about what's best for<br/>us," said Carrot as he calmed again. "Ranma, you've got to quit<br/>sulking around so much. I'm the brains of this operation, Dan is the<br/>muscle when we need it, and you're, well, you're our skill. We all<br/>need each other for this to work out."<p>"He's right, we've got to work out a compromise, or we'll end up<br/>getting ourself killed," agreed Dan.<p>"And before you even think it, Akane isn't a compromise," said<br/>Carrot sharply.<p>"Hey! I don't like that uncute tomboy!" replied Ranma.<p>"Good, keep it that way," said Dan coolly. "Neither of us likes<br/>her either."<p>"Ranma, have you ever just tried having fun with this? I mean,<br/>you're taking this so seriously. Relax, enjoy having us around, we're<br/>going to be here whether you're happy with it or not."<p>"I'd rather die," snapped Ranma coldly.<p>"Fine, you might get your wish," said Carrot with a shrug. "You'll<br/>lose your mind if you keep fighting us. Come on, we're not all that<br/>bad."<p>"Shut up," snorted Ranma bitterly.<p>"Let's go home, I don't feel like school today," said Dan as he<br/>turned them towards the gates.<p>++++++++++<p>Setsuna looked into the Time Gate and frowned, an image was<br/>becoming clear at last. Slowly, a shadowy figure appeared in the<br/>mirror. It was only a silhouette, but it was enough. She smiled and<br/>her headache almost vanished completely.<p>"Oh, this is too perfect," she said with a small chuckle, a<br/>chuckle that slowly built into full blown laughter.<p>The image before her revealed the source of the chaos at last.<br/>Ranma Saotome was looking at her coldly, with two ghostly figures on<br/>either side of him.<p>"I had thought you'd been killed, but apparently I was wrong.<br/>Genaku McTome, you've changed sides it seems. Now that you oppose the<br/>queen's will, I can destroy you at last."<p>Soon, Artemis would receive a call from his anonymous benefactor<br/>again. This time, the target would be clear at last.<p>The Senshi of Pluto had not been so happy in over a thousand<br/>years.<p>++++++++++<p>"Furinkan High School..." muttered Ryoga as he stood directly in<br/>front of his destination. His face was buried inside a road map of<br/>Tokyo. "Where is the blasted place?"<p>One of the students nearby overheard him and was about to speak.<br/>Ryoga turned away at the last moment though. "Oh! A telephone box!<br/>I'll call information!"<p>The student watched in shock as the boy walked into a bright red<br/>phone<br/>booth that had appeared next to the wall of Furinkan. He managed to<br/>catch a glimpse of another confused looking gajin inside the booth,<br/>just before the whole thing vanished.<p>"Um, never mind," said the boy as he wandered off. Swearing never<br/>to<br/>leave his house again, or make another phone call for as long as he<br/>lived.<p>++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Venus Attacks! The way to Nabiki's heart...<p>
