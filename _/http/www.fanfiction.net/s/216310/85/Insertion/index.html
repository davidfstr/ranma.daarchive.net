</div>Insertion<p>Part 85<p>It's the end of Jurai as we know<br/>it...[and I feel fine.]<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Majin Buu?" said Tenchi in<br/>confusion as he stared at Trunks for a<br/>moment.<p>The boy merely nodded as the group<br/>glared at the pink thing in front of<br/>them for a moment.<p>"What's the big deal?" grumbled<br/>Ryoko irritably as she tensed.<p>"What indeed?" asked Buu calmly.<br/>"Are you ready?"<p>Trunks smirked. "You're not Buu.<br/>You're just a pathetic fanboy copying<br/>something he saw on Television. I'm not<br/>worried at all."<p>"Well, I'd like to think of myself<br/>as more of a tribute, but if you<br/>insist," replied the pink thing<br/>cheerfully.<p>Trunks nodded at Ryoko and Hotaru.<p>"His power level has risen,"<br/>commented Hotaru as she glanced at<br/>Trunks.<p>"I'd noticed that," replied the boy<br/>with a smirk. "We shouldn't have too<br/>much trouble with this loser though."<p>Buu snorted and frowned at them. He<br/>raised his palm over his head and a pink<br/>light formed there. The group tensed as<br/>thousands of tiny tendrils of energy<br/>shot from his palm and into the air,<br/>creating an umbrella of destruction that<br/>rained down around them. "We'll see<br/>about that won't we?"<p>"Damn!" cried Ryoko as she realized<br/>that there was too much for even them to<br/>dodge coming down on them.<p>Trunks merely smirked and crossed<br/>his arms. "Well, I'm glad we've found a<br/>use for you after all."<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>"No!" gasped Ayeka as the screen in<br/>front of them was blocked out by a<br/>bright pink light that was visible from<br/>orbit. It spread out across the surface<br/>of the planet, and the ground became a<br/>bright orange in color.<p>"And so Jurai falls," said Azusa<br/>calmly as he hung his head.<p>"All things come to an end, but<br/>Jurai's time has not yet come," said<br/>Yosho.<p>"Eh?" said the Emperor as he glanced<br/>up at him.<p>"Watch," said Washuu with a smirk<br/>forming on her face.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Pluto stared into the gates of time.<br/>Horror was clear on her face as she<br/>simply stared into the image that<br/>assaulted her. The newly repaired staff<br/>in her hand wavered as she almost lost<br/>her grip on it. "No! How could this have<br/>happened?"<p>The Earth was ravaged, destruction<br/>and anarchy was all she could see. The<br/>last vestiges of humanity clinging to<br/>life by a thread and it was growing<br/>frayed. Soon the thread would break, and<br/>darkness would lord over the universe<br/>for an untold amount of time. The senshi<br/>were alive, if you could call it that.<br/>Usagi's imprisonment, the death of her<br/>friends, and the struggles of their<br/>children played out before her in<br/>flashing images. It was a battle that<br/>could not be won. Chibi-Usa's eventual<br/>betrayal, everything that she loved and<br/>fought for, all gone in a few short<br/>years. It was all beginning now, and<br/>there was nothing she could do to stop<br/>it. Her power was far to low for her to<br/>oppose this force; she would be<br/>destroyed by it in the end, leaving her<br/>daughter to fight on in her place. If<br/>she survived long enough to be found<br/>after floating in space for twenty<br/>years.<p>"What happened? Where did we go<br/>wrong?" She growled angrily as she<br/>realized it all at once. "I was right<br/>about him all along. I should have<br/>destroyed him...I should have..." She<br/>fell to her knees and sobbed. Time went<br/>on before her eyes, more suffering and<br/>pain. She couldn't bear to watch any<br/>longer. "What can I do?"<p>The gates of time shimmered for the<br/>briefest of moments; an image came<br/>before her that she did not see long<br/>enough to focus through her tears.<p>Someone stepped through the gate and<br/>stood over her. She slowly pulled her<br/>head up to stare at the newcomer with<br/>tear filled eyes.<p>"Don't cry Puu, it's not as bad as<br/>it seems," said an unfamiliar voice.<p>"Who?" she muttered in confusion.<p>The figure turned away from her his<br/>back facing her as he walked towards the<br/>door to the chamber. "Let's go.<br/>Shouldn't take us too long to get there<br/>from here. A day at most."<p>"Right," commented another voice as<br/>someone else stepped through the gates<br/>of time and smirked at her.<p>"Who are you?" she demanded as she<br/>rose to her feet. Her grief and the<br/>feeling of helplessness melted away,<br/>having dulled her reaction up to this<br/>point.<p>"Me? Just a friend. Sorry we don't<br/>have time to explain, but we've got work<br/>to do," said the first boy as he smirked<br/>at her from over his shoulder.<p>Pluto blinked at this. The pair was<br/>in their mid-teens, and the both of them<br/>were walking about as if they owned the<br/>place. She felt a spike of anger flow<br/>through her body and leveled the staff<br/>in her hands at them. "You two will<br/>return at once!"<p>The second boy spoke, brushing his<br/>long bangs out of his face with an idle<br/>gesture. He had brown hair that was tied<br/>into a ponytail that went to the middle<br/>of his back. His companion had short cut<br/>black hair that was spiked up slightly.<br/>"How much worse can it get lady?"<p>With that, the pair walked out and<br/>left her standing alone. She blinked and<br/>rushed out the door glancing around the<br/>hall in search of them. The pair was<br/>gone. "AAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHH!" She screamed<br/>in frustration and began to run through<br/>the halls, searching for them.<br/>"Bastards! I'll get them for this!" She<br/>fell down to her knees as a sharp pain<br/>stabbed into her forehead. "What?<br/>Again?" she muttered angrily as she<br/>slowly rose to her feet after a moment.<br/>"Damn it! I am the senshi of time! How<br/>can I be surprised so much in such a<br/>short amount of time?" she snarled<br/>angrily.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Tochi snarled as she reared back her<br/>head and backed through the doorway to<br/>the concert hall. A crystal gorged on<br/>power rested in her clawed hands as her<br/>claws ripped up the carpet in her wake.<br/>"Soon, our plan will be realized!" she<br/>growled through her inhuman face as she<br/>glared at the group standing in front of<br/>her.<p>Akane Tendo was breathing hard,<br/>leaning against one of the seats with a<br/>silver rifle of some kind in her hands.<br/>She was winded and beaten, but alive.<br/>Stones protruded from the ground, spikes<br/>of rock with people impaled on them<br/>littered the room in the aftermath of<br/>the battle. "We did it."<p>Ranma frowned as his transformation<br/>powered down, his golden hair settling<br/>back into black as he stared at the<br/>doorway with an unreadable expression on<br/>his face. "Yes, we did."<p>Jadeite and Kunzite were sitting off<br/>to the corner, nursing a few small<br/>wounds as the calm after the battle<br/>settled in. They were all scratched up,<br/>but none of them was in any danger of<br/>dying.<p>"This one is worse than the one<br/>before it," grumbled Kunzite angrily.<br/>"We always manage to drive it off, but<br/>are we really winning?"<p>"I know we are," said Ranma with an<br/>odd-looking smirk forming on his face.<p>"Doesn't seem that clear to me,"<br/>commented Kunzite irritably.<p>Ranma chuckled. "Of course you're<br/>losing," he thought to himself. "I am<br/>not though, nor are my allies." He<br/>turned away and walked out of the room,<br/>leaving them sitting there to tend to<br/>their own wounds.<p>"Where are you going?" asked Akane.<p>"I've got business to take care of,<br/>I'll meet you back at the headquarters."<p>Jadeite glanced at Kunzite and<br/>frowned. "Something's up with him."<p>"I know," said Kunzite irritably.<p>"He's been doing this a lot lately,"<br/>said Akane with a rough sounding snort<br/>as she plopped herself against the wall<br/>next to them. The rifle was slung across<br/>her shoulder carelessly and she scowled.<br/>"It's bothering the hell out of me."<p>"No kidding," grumbled Kunzite. "We<br/>should keep this to ourselves at the<br/>moment though."<p>"Nephrite suspects as well," said<br/>Jadeite.<p>"Zocite has expressed suspicions<br/>with me also," agreed Kunzite. "We have<br/>to do something about this."<p>"What? He's all that's keeping us<br/>alive right now," said Jadeite with his<br/>frown deepening. "Without him, we are<br/>helpless against them."<p>"The senshi are still gone," said<br/>Akane with her head hung low. "So is my<br/>sister."<p>"He seems confident that we're<br/>winning. I wish I could share that<br/>sentiment," said Jadeite as he stood up.<br/>"We should go, it won't be long before<br/>the police arrive. They can clean this<br/>mess up."<p>Akane sighed and nodded as she<br/>allowed herself to be helped to her<br/>feet. Kunzite did the same and they<br/>walked out of the building together.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>"How long are you going to keep this<br/>up?" said Tochi as she landed beside<br/>Ranma. The pair was standing on top of a<br/>rooftop overlooking Shinjuku. It was<br/>silent and a cold wind blew through the<br/>air.<p>"Heh. It amuses me. Let me enjoy my<br/>game."<p>"It's dangerous," said Tochi.<p>"These fools will never become<br/>strong enough to defeat us, anyone with<br/>that ability is on Jurai. Ekitai is<br/>doing away with them as we speak.<br/>There's nothing to worry about," replied<br/>the pigtailed boy calmly. "Everything is<br/>going according to my plan."<p>"You sound doubtful of that," said<br/>Tochi as she placed her hand on his<br/>shoulder.<p>Ranma growled as he looked up at the<br/>sky. "It should be me out there doing<br/>this. I should kill them myself.<br/>Ekitai..."<p>"He is superior to you in power,"<br/>said Tochi calmly as she smirked a<br/>little.<p>"He will fail. They will return<br/>stronger than ever," replied Ranma<br/>coldly.<p>"You worry too much," said Tochi as<br/>she squeezed his shoulder a little.<p>"We should have sent me with him, or<br/>Chibi-Usa..."<p>"To do what?"<p>"Make sure everything goes smoothly!<br/>Kuroi should have taken care of this<br/>himself. They are the biggest danger to<br/>our plans!" snapped Ranma as she jerked<br/>away from her grip. "Knowing that fool<br/>is out there, failing miserably is<br/>eating me alive."<p>"Ekitai is the second strongest of<br/>our kind. Only Kuroi surpasses him, you<br/>should relax," commented the Youma as<br/>she smirked at his reaction a little.<p>"That's why he should have gone!<br/>Ekitai will not return to us!"<p>"Then, we'll just have to blow them<br/>out of the sky, and leave them to the<br/>void when they try to return," said<br/>Tochi as she moved closer to his side.<p>"Heh, you make it sound so easy,"<br/>replied the boy as he glanced at her for<br/>a moment.<p>"Who says it isn't?" asked Tochi as<br/>she leaned in and kissed him on the<br/>cheek.<p>Ranma snorted and wiped the side of<br/>his face with the back of his hand.<br/>"That doesn't mean I'm not going to take<br/>precautions. Does Kuroi have what I<br/>need?"<p>"The room is as you asked for."<p>"Good, get me the spore. We're going<br/>now then," said Ranma calmly.<p>"What about your game?" asked Tochi<br/>with a surprised blink.<p>"Do what you want with them. I will<br/>not fail," said Ranma angrily as he<br/>clenched his fist at his side.<p>"Very well," said the woman with her<br/>grin growing inhuman. Her teeth<br/>protruded over her lips and she<br/>chuckled.<p>"Heh. For a moment, I almost found<br/>you attractive," he said in reaction to<br/>this.<p>"Would you have done anything about<br/>it?" she said playfully. "All this<br/>training, it's making you boring. It's<br/>all you do these days."<p>"I'll be interesting enough once<br/>those fools on Jurai are dealt with,"<br/>said Ranma coldly.<p>"We'll see then," she replied as she<br/>turned away. She pulled out a small<br/>round object that looked somewhat like a<br/>compact. "Spore."<p>Chibi-Usa's face appeared on the<br/>tiny screen inside of the communicator.<br/>"I've told you about that."<p>"Your father wants you," said Tochi.<p>"About what?" snorted the woman on<br/>the other side.<p>"Well, for one thing, you should<br/>still be a child. It's dangerous to go<br/>around like that at the moment," said<br/>Tochi with a slightly amused frown.<p>"That's my business," replied the<br/>Black Lady coldly. "What does that old<br/>fool want?"<p>"What do you think?" snorted Tochi.<p>"Again? He is too paranoid! I'm<br/>proof enough of the outcome of this,"<br/>said Chibi-Usa coldly.<p>Ranma snatched the device from Tochi<br/>and glared at the screen for a moment.<br/>"Humor me then. I might decide that<br/>you're usefulness is at an end after<br/>you've ensured my future you know."<p>Chibi-Usa growled at this and glared<br/>at him. "I'll be there."<p>"Good, because if I decided that you<br/>were boring, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't<br/>be too worried about losing you. Make<br/>sure an old man has a little bit of a<br/>challenge in his daughter." He closed<br/>the communication down and snorted.<p>"Offspring should be dealt with<br/>harshly. It makes them stronger," said<br/>Tochi as she accepted the device from<br/>him as he shoved it into her palm.<p>Ranma glanced at her for a moment<br/>without a single word, and flew into the<br/>sky leaving her there on the roof.<p>"Well, played," said Tochi. "Exactly<br/>the kind of man I'd want for my own<br/>nest."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Tatewaki Kuno walked along the<br/>sidewalk in the middle of the night. He<br/>had a contemplative frown on his face as<br/>the sky grew more and more angry.<p>"Ranma Saotome," he muttered under<br/>his breath. The target of his hatred,<br/>the one who dared keep his one true love<br/>away from his arms by some unknown<br/>magic... hadn't been seen on the school<br/>grounds for weeks.<p>He cocked his head in irritation as<br/>he mulled over this. He had gone to the<br/>Tendo home a few times to face his<br/>rival. The coward was hardly ever there,<br/>running from his prowess no doubt. It<br/>was understandable, there were few who<br/>would not wet themselves at just the<br/>sight of his mighty sword.<p>Still, it was irritating. He wished<br/>to face the fool in battle, and prove to<br/>him that he was the best man to hold<br/>Akane Tendo's heart. Both to the coward<br/>Ranma, and to Akane herself. Surely she<br/>would rush into his arms after he<br/>defeated such an enemy. On the few<br/>occasions he did find him, he was held<br/>back from his full potential by unknown<br/>magic. Something was staying his hand,<br/>and preventing his strikes from<br/>connecting. Oddly enough, the strange<br/>magic had almost cost him his life<br/>several times. Surely is sheer prowess<br/>had stayed the curse from being<br/>completed.<p>Well, that and the young child who<br/>had become enamored with his purity and<br/>grace. She seemed to have tamed the<br/>savage lowborn fool enough to force him<br/>to stay his hand at the end of a battle.<br/>Something about 'needing him in the<br/>future or something'. No doubt an<br/>innocent wish to become his wife in the<br/>future. He would hate to break the young<br/>maiden's heart when he wed Akane Tendo,<br/>but it had to be done.<p>His musings were cut short when he<br/>heard something unusual. The hour was<br/>late and he was returning home from a<br/>full day of meditation, or rather,<br/>walking around in the hope of running<br/>into Ranma Saotome on the street.<p>Whatever it was, it was somewhat<br/>muffled. He was near to a small park in<br/>one of the residential areas. He was<br/>pretty sure he was still in Nerima, but<br/>not completely so. He'd been walking all<br/>day, and may have wandered into a nearby<br/>ward.<p>The sight that greeted him was<br/>definitely not what he was expecting.<p>It was a man with a green face wearing a<br/>trench coat. He was clutching his head<br/>as if in pain, and was making a rather<br/>painful sounding grunting noise. "What<br/>magic is..." His eyes went wide as the<br/>man started to pull his face off.<p>"GAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!" cried Hikaru<br/>Gosunkugi as he finally freed himself of<br/>the mask. His eyes were wide and horror<br/>filled as he tossed it to the ground at<br/>his feet. He glared at it in horror and<br/>gasped for breath. He put his hands up<br/>in front of his face, they were covered<br/>in blood.<p>He had just raided a local drug<br/>house. Not all that unusual in itself,<br/>but this time he had lost it completely.<br/>"My god. What have I done?" he muttered<br/>under his breath as tears filled his<br/>eyes. Images flooded his mind, not<br/>clouded as they usually were after such<br/>an episode. Images of his hands ripping<br/>out a man's spinal chord through his<br/>mouth. Images of himself shoving a<br/>plunger through a woman's head. Worst of<br/>all, an image of himself tearing of<br/>someone's head, and taking the time to<br/>shit down their neck. "It's getting<br/>worse!" he muttered to himself in<br/>horror. "I'm growing more and more<br/>violent! What's happening to me?"<p>Unfortunately, he didn't notice the<br/>silent figure standing nearby, watching<br/>him intently. A voice brought him out of<br/>his stupor.<p>"What magic is this?"<p>Hikaru Gosunkugi's head shot up and<br/>his eyes went wide. "Kuno?" he muttered<br/>as recognition set in. "I..."<p>Tatewaki Kuno knelt down beside him<br/>and stared at him for a moment. "I'm..."<br/>he stammered. It didn't take him long to<br/>realize that the boy was on his feet<br/>again a moment later. "What?"<p>The mask wasn't on the ground<br/>anymore, it was sitting in Kuno's hands<br/>as the boy stared at it.<p>"What? No! You can't! That..."<p>Kuno snorted and thwacked the boy<br/>over his head with the bokken in his<br/>hand and sent him to the ground in a<br/>heap. "Lowborn fool! You shall not stay<br/>me from my path! At last I have<br/>discovered a way to rid myself of the<br/>foul and cowardly sorcerer known as<br/>Ranma Saotome!" He blinked and seemed to<br/>realize what he was doing as he looked<br/>at the unconscious boy for a moment. He<br/>was basically robbing him. "I...No doubt<br/>he would see the need of my person of<br/>such magics, and gladly donate this to<br/>my cause!" He slipped the mask into his<br/>shirt and continued on his way.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Majin Buu smirked at the area around<br/>him, it was little more than a molten<br/>pit. He floated above the lava and<br/>chuckled to himself. "Well, I am<br/>impressed."<p>Trunks, Hotaru, Ryoko, and Tenchi<br/>were floating nearby. Tenchi had his<br/>hands in the air over their heads<br/>generating a shield of power to cover<br/>them. There was also a patch of ground<br/>just under them, unmolested by the<br/>assault.<p>Trunks snorted and floated forward.<br/>"Are we supposed to be impressed by<br/>that? Any one of us could do what you<br/>just did without much effort."<p>"The fun is just starting," chimed<br/>Buu cheerfully.<p>"That it is," said Trunks as he<br/>moved into a combat stance.<p>"We should help him," said Ryoko.<p>"He'll be angry if you try," said<br/>Hotaru calmly. "Just wait. He's testing<br/>the waters so to speak. This is for our<br/>benefit as much as his."<p>"What?" said Tenchi dumbly.<p>"Even if he doesn't manage to<br/>destroy him, we'll have some idea of how<br/>he fights, and what to expect. I suspect<br/>that our young friend already knows what<br/>he's up against."<p>Ryoko nodded silently at this and<br/>seemed to calm visibly.<p>"We shouldn't help then?" asked<br/>Tenchi.<p>"I didn't say that, just be ready,"<br/>replied Hotaru.<p>Trunks glanced back at them and<br/>Hotaru nodded to him. He focused his<br/>attention on Buu after that, not<br/>worrying that one of the others would<br/>try to rush him head on.<p>"Trying to take me on all alone?"<br/>said Buu with a small disgusted snort.<p>"Don't look so disappointed,"<br/>commented Trunks as he started to raise<br/>his power levels.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>"What's going on?" growled a stoic<br/>looking Juraian as he sat in the command<br/>chair of one of the warships that<br/>circled above the planet in wait.<p>"I'm not certain sir!" said one of<br/>the officers. "They appear to still be<br/>talking."<p>"How did they survive that blast?"<br/>said the Captain as he glanced at the<br/>man.<p>"I'm not certain sir. The ship that<br/>rescued the Emperor has not yet reached<br/>the fleet, but it is definitely off the<br/>surface."<p>Trunks could be seen on the screen<br/>from an overhead view that looked to be<br/>about twenty feet above the fight. A<br/>field of power started to form around<br/>his body that was visible on the screen.<p>"Energy reading sir!" exclaimed one<br/>of the men.<p>"I can see that!" snapped the<br/>Captain. "What about that thing?"<p>"Still nothing sir, we're not<br/>getting a reading from it at all," said<br/>the man as he glanced at his console.<br/>His eyes went wide and he stood up from<br/>his seat. "Impossible."<p>"Eh?" said the Captain as he glanced<br/>at him.<p>"Sir! That man is generating enough<br/>power..."<p>"What is it! Spit it out!" snapped<br/>the Captain impatiently.<p>"He's generating enough power to run<br/>this ship for six months," said the man<br/>as he looked up at his Captain.<p>"Pardon?" asked the man with a<br/>disbelieving snort.<p>Unfortunately for the poor man,<br/>Trunks achieved his Super Saiyan form at<br/>that very moment.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Well, that is impressive. I'm sure<br/>Takibi was outclassed." Buu chuckled to<br/>himself as he eyed the golden warrior in<br/>front of him for a moment.<p>"Match boy never saw this form,"<br/>said Trunks confidently. "I'm a real<br/>Super Saiyan now."<p>"Bah!" snorted Buu as he waited<br/>patiently.<p>Trunks snorted and blasted forward<br/>in a blaze of light. Buu smirked as the<br/>boy slammed into him fist first at full<br/>force.<p>The boy gasped as he felt the blow<br/>connect. Buu was shot back and Trunks<br/>pressed the advantage, chasing his<br/>target down and overtaking it easily. He<br/>seemed to appear behind it and kicked it<br/>upwards, repeating the process as he<br/>shot skyward and moved in front of the<br/>pink thing once again. He kicked it<br/>downward and paused.<p>For the briefest of moments he had<br/>seen Buu's face before he was sent<br/>careening towards the lava below. The<br/>thing was grinning at him. "What the?"<p>Buu never hit the ground. He stopped<br/>his decent and folded his arms over his<br/>chest. "My, how interesting this is."<p>"What?" gasped Tenchi.<p>"No way!" growled Ryoko angrily, her<br/>aura started to burn.<p>Hotaru merely frowned at it and<br/>narrowed her eyes. "Interesting."<p>"Not ready to join us yet?" asked<br/>Buu as he turned to look at her for a<br/>moment.<p>"We'll see," said Hotaru calmly as<br/>she held her position.<p>Trunks floated nearby and watched<br/>the pink thing for a moment as it seemed<br/>to ignore him. "What's going on? I know<br/>there's no way he's that strong! He had<br/>to feel it at least!" His mind searched<br/>for an explanation and he growled in<br/>frustration.<p>"Ready to try again?" asked Buu<br/>calmly.<p>"Ka-me-ha-me-HA!" snapped Trunks as<br/>he thrust his hands forward. A beam of<br/>power shot towards Buu and the thing<br/>merely smiled at him malevolently.<br/>Trunks simply stood there with his mouth<br/>hanging open as the beam seemed to pass<br/>right through the center of the thing's<br/>chest. "No way!"<p>"Your power is pathetic," said Buu<br/>coldly.<p>"I'm not getting anything from him!"<br/>thought Trunks in frustration. "Not even<br/>a glimmer of power! Is he an illusion?"<br/>He grit his teeth in frustration. "Is<br/>that it? He's not real?"<p>"Trying to figure this out?" asked<br/>Buu calmly.<p>Trunks looked at his hands, he had<br/>felt himself connect, he knew that he<br/>had felt his fists hit something solid.<br/>"This is some kind of trick. I know it,"<br/>he growled angrily.<p>"Hmmm, where have I heard that<br/>before?" said Buu playfully.<p>Trunks blushed despite himself. "I'm<br/>really starting to hate Dragon Ball," he<br/>grumbled under his breath. He blasted<br/>forward and attacked Buu again, raining<br/>blows into the thing and feeling every<br/>one of them connect solidly. He jumped<br/>back and growled as the thing stood<br/>there smirking at him and seemingly<br/>unharmed despite everything he had<br/>thrown at it. "Damn!"<p>"Ha! You're a weak and pathetic<br/>fighter! I haven't even felt a single<br/>blow! I'm growing tired of this!" Buu<br/>grinned at him and pointed with his<br/>finger in a mocking gesture.<p>"What am I missing here?" growled<br/>Trunks.<p>"If you haven't figured it out yet,<br/>too bad. Playtime is over. I've got a<br/>job to do, and when I'm finished, the<br/>entire Universe is mine for the taking!"<p>Trunks tensed himself and crouched<br/>slightly as he prepared.<p>"I'm getting kind of hungry," said<br/>Buu as he glanced over at the group that<br/>was watching the battle. "How about<br/>you?"<p>Trunks growled.<p>"I know, I'll make you a cookie!"<p>He pointed his finger at Ryoko and<br/>grinned.<p>"What?" said the woman dumbly.<p>A strange transparent energy formed<br/>around her body, distorting the air<br/>slightly. Ryoko screamed painfully and<br/>jerked suddenly with her eyes wide with<br/>fear and pain. She fell forward and<br/>gasped as it stopped suddenly and she<br/>almost fell into the boiling lake of<br/>lava below them. Tenchi managed to catch<br/>her and hold her in the air.<p>Trunks had attacked Buu in the<br/>middle of his assault. The thing was<br/>glaring at him irritably. "Hmm, takes a<br/>long time to work if you're still<br/>strong. I guess I'll have to wear you<br/>out a bit if I want to eat."<p>The boy moved back into a combat<br/>stance and stared at it hatefully.<br/>"Bring it on."<p>"As you wish!" said Buu as it<br/>charged for the first time, in the one<br/>on one battle, it was on the assault.<p>Trunks reeled as blow after blow<br/>slammed into his body. The thing was too<br/>fast for him to follow, it was almost as<br/>if it was punching through his blocks.<br/>He cried out in pain and struggled to<br/>stay aloft despite the battle. "Damn<br/>it!"<p>Buu chuckled as he kicked his<br/>opponent across the sky. Trunks sailed<br/>back through the air and actually<br/>cleared the huge lava crater that Buu's<br/>first assault had caused. He slammed<br/>into the ground and dug a long rift into<br/>the soil. Finally he stopped and looked<br/>up at the sky painfully. "Ouch."<p>"Did that hurt? Don't worry, it will<br/>be over soon," said Buu as he floated<br/>just overhead with a smirk on his face.<p>"Damn," growled Trunks as he rose to<br/>his feet. "I'm gonna have to go all<br/>out!"<p>"Eh?" said Buu dumbly.<p>Trunks screamed as his aura blasted<br/>outward again. His hair and body grew<br/>slightly larger and his eyes became an<br/>ever-deeper shade of blue. "I was hoping<br/>to save this form for Ranma, but I<br/>suppose I really should try it out<br/>first."<p>Buu sneered. "It won't matter how<br/>strong you become, you'll never defeat<br/>me," said the thing calmly.<p>Trunks shot into the sky again,<br/>attacking full force. Buu returned every<br/>blow he was given with an unnatural<br/>skill that Trunks knew he shouldn't<br/>have.<p>"Growing tired yet?" said Buu<br/>playfully.<p>Trunks snarled in frustration and<br/>anger. "This isn't possible!" Buu<br/>actually felt harder now, he couldn't<br/>figure out what was wrong.<p>"Get out of my way weakling," said<br/>the pink thing calmly as he kicked<br/>Trunks across his face with a spinning<br/>blow.<p>The boy sailed through the air once<br/>again and landed hard on the ground. His<br/>impact shot up a huge cloud of dust that<br/>enveloped almost a full square mile of<br/>the planet's surface. Buu chuckled and<br/>waited patiently for his opponent to<br/>return.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"This shouldn't be!" said Washuu as<br/>she stared at the scene that played in<br/>front of them.<p>"No! Get away!" gasped Ayeka. "We<br/>have to contact them! Tell them to run!"<p>Yosho looked at her for a moment and<br/>frowned. "Even if we could, I doubt they<br/>would listen."<p>Nabiki glanced back at him and then<br/>looked at the screen. "That thing isn't<br/>that skilled."<p>"What?" muttered Usagi as she looked<br/>at the girl next to her in shock. She<br/>had been silent for the entire fight up<br/>to this point.<p>"Something is wrong, Ranma should be<br/>wiping the floor with that thing," said<br/>Nabiki calmly. "I don't think it's that<br/>strong."<p>"You noticed that as well?" asked<br/>Yosho calmly as he continued to stare at<br/>the screen. "I do not believe that this<br/>creature is as strong as it is<br/>pretending to be. I can only hope that<br/>they find an answer soon."<p>"What?" muttered Rei dumbly.<p>"Not that powerful?" gasped Azusa.<p>Washuu glanced at Ami and the girl<br/>nodded.<p>"It seems that this thing, is not as<br/>powerful as it claims. The reason you<br/>failed Azusa, is because you were trying<br/>to fight off the power of your own<br/>planet."<p>"What?" gasped the Emperor in shock.<p>"Yes, I agree," said Ami. "I believe<br/>that this enemy has its strength in<br/>deception, not power. It doesn't matter<br/>how hard Trunks punches it, it will not<br/>be defeated that way."<p>Washuu blinked at this. "I was<br/>referring to the fact that it's powering<br/>itself with Jurai itself."<p>"Really?" said Ami in confusion.<br/>"That makes it even more dangerous<br/>then."<p>"Then why did Lord Tenchi's<br/>shield..." muttered Ayeka.<p>"Because Tenchi is using the power<br/>within himself, and not the power of<br/>Tsunami," replied Yosho calmly.<p>"What?" gasped Ayeka.<p>"Tsunami can be copied," replied<br/>Washuu. "However, even if I were to<br/>clone you, there would still be subtle<br/>differences between the real you, and<br/>the clone you."<p>"You mean...Lord Tenchi?"<p>"It's because he's half human,"<br/>replied Washuu.<p>Everyone looked at her for a moment.<p>"Something about human blood causes<br/>an odd mutation when mixed with certain<br/>species. It enables them to become<br/>stronger than the original species. It's<br/>one of the great mysteries of the<br/>universe. They are a relatively weak<br/>species on their own, but combined with<br/>the right genes..." She turned and<br/>smirked at Azusa. "Of course, that was<br/>no accident, was it?"<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Still not enough," growled Trunks<br/>painfully as he waited for the cloud of<br/>dust around him to clear away a bit. He<br/>was coughing violently as he said this<br/>and tried to breath in the dust.<p>"Shit! What the hell am I gonna do<br/>now?" he thought as he glared at the<br/>ground. "I'm at my maximum and I can't<br/>even scratch him! My beam passed through<br/>him like he wasn't even there!"<p>He glanced up and saw the pink thing<br/>floating on the other side of the slowly<br/>fading haze above him. "More power?<br/>Maybe if I get strong enough..." His<br/>eyes turned to where his friends were<br/>standing. They wouldn't move to attack<br/>unless he said too, or died. He knew<br/>that as they were now, they wouldn't<br/>stand a chance.<p>"This is it. All my power, a single<br/>strike!" he floated into the air slowly,<br/>facing off against Buu.<p>"Back again are you? Haven't you<br/>given up yet?"<p>"Rrrrrrrr..." was the only reply the<br/>thing got.<p>Buu opened his mouth slightly and<br/>stared at the Saiyan for a moment as it<br/>started to glow again. "This again?<br/>Really..."<p>"You won't be laughing when I'm<br/>through with you," growled Trunks.<p>Buu shifted his stance and watched<br/>the boy warily. "What? What's he doing?"<br/>Without thinking he dashed forward in an<br/>attack.<p>Trunks dodged by shooting backwards<br/>suddenly and stopping about two hundred<br/>yards away. His aura grew brighter and<br/>he looked down at the ground. He started<br/>to descend as his aura continued to<br/>glow. Occasionally Buu would take<br/>another halfhearted swipe at him and<br/>he'd move out of the way. He always<br/>faced the thing though and it grew more<br/>and more confused.<p>"What are you doing? " snarled Buu.<p>Trunks smirked as he glanced down at<br/>his friends. They looked to be just as<br/>confused as Buu was. He appeared to be<br/>doing nothing more than taunting the<br/>thing with his battle aura raised.<br/>"It's time," he said quietly as he eyed<br/>the pink thing that was starting to grow<br/>more impatient by the moment.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"What's he doing?" muttered Ryoko in<br/>confusion. "He's charging for something,<br/>but I don't see..."<p>"Too much power!" gasped Tenchi.<p>Hotaru was as silent as ever as she<br/>watched the battle. "What is he doing?<br/>All that power?" She glanced back at<br/>Tenchi and Ryoko. "Get ready to fight."<p>"What?" said the boy in shock.<p>"If this doesn't work, Trunks will<br/>be unable to continue," said Hotaru<br/>calmly.<p>Tenchi glared at the boy as he put<br/>his hands together. "No! What's he<br/>doing! He's gonna blow up the whole<br/>planet!"<p>"What?" gasped Ryoko. That was when<br/>she realized that Tenchi was right. "You<br/>crazy bastard! Stop that!" She started<br/>to float up to stop him, but Hotaru<br/>managed to catch her ankle and slammed<br/>her into the ground. "Are you nuts?<br/>We're gonna die!"<p>"Watch," said Hotaru as she nodded.<p>Trunks's face contorted into a mask<br/>of rage, and he dropped down slightly in<br/>the air. "Final Flash!" he cried aloud<br/>as the energy beam rocketed from his<br/>hands towards Buu.<p>The thing's eyes went wide as it saw<br/>the power shooting towards it. The<br/>golden energy seemed to slam into its<br/>body all at once.<p>Trunks hit the ground hard, he<br/>bounced and lay there still. Balls of<br/>pink goo splattered across the ground<br/>messily all around the area where Buu<br/>had been destroyed.<p>Hotaru narrowed her eyes as she<br/>watched the beam continue to sail into<br/>the sky. It vanished from sight and she<br/>grimaced as several smaller secondary<br/>explosions could be seen in space. "You<br/>dope. All the Juraians are above us!"<p>Trunks was out cold though and heard<br/>nothing.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>"GAAAAAAHHHHHH! That idiot!" cried<br/>Ayeka as she watched the beam sail out<br/>into space a few miles in the distance.<br/>No less than four cruisers had been<br/>destroyed in its passing.<p>"A small price to pay, for the<br/>safety of our planet," said Azusa with a<br/>heavy sigh. "It seems we are in the debt<br/>of that boy."<p>Yosho nodded. "So it would seem."<p>Washuu heaved a sigh of relief and<br/>sat down. "Well, I'm glad that's over<br/>with."<p>"It's over?" asked Usagi with a wide<br/>smile growing on her face.<p>Makoto laughed and grabbed Rei in a<br/>rather rough hug. The others inside the<br/>ship quickly followed, even Nabiki pat<br/>Usagi on the back with a smile on her<br/>face. It was easy to tell everyone was<br/>relieved to say the least.<p>Everyone that is, but Ami Mizuno.<p>Ami Mizuno was sitting down with her<br/>laptop on her knees. Her eyes were wide<br/>and she simply stared at the screen in<br/>front of her in what could have been<br/>horror. A screen that showed Majin Buu<br/>with a huge grin on his face, exploding,<br/>while the beam was still ten feet in<br/>front of him.<p>She raised her head and spoke three<br/>words that silenced everyone with a<br/>surprising quietness. "It's not over."<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...
