</div>Insertion<p>Part 86<p>The Mysterious Youths...<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks lay on the ground unmoving, and the remains of Buu were<br/>scattered across the ground. It was deathly silent and nothing could<br/>be heard, not even the wind.<p>"It's over?" muttered Trunks as he looked at the fallen pink blobs<br/>of liquid on the ground and frowned.<p>Hotaru frowned slightly and looked at the boy for a moment. "I<br/>still feel a strong power, he's still alive."<p>Tenchi gasped and looked at her for a moment. "What?"<p>"Be prepared, Trunks can't help us right now," said the girl as<br/>she gave her master a sidelong glance for a moment.<p>Almost in response to that, the small pink blobs began to quiver<br/>on the ground violently.<p>"Shit!" snapped Ryoko. "It didn't kill him?" She had no illusions<br/>about their power, Trunks was the strongest of all of them. Still,<br/>their combined might be able to let them fight the thing.<p>Tenchi's frown deepened as he watched the pink substance slide<br/>together. "Damn."<p>"Can we stop it?" asked Ryoko as she watched it begin to form<br/>together. She blasted one of the pink blobs with a bolt of ki,<br/>transforming as she did so. There was a huge explosion and the pink<br/>blob emerged from the smoke on the other side unscathed. "Damn!"<p>Hotaru and Tenchi tried a similar tactic, but had the same<br/>results. The blobs were seemingly immune from their power somehow.<br/>"This isn't working!" growled the senshi irritably.<p>"Heh, pathetic," said Buu as his body neared completion. "You're<br/>no match for me fools."<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Akane sat at her desk with a scowl on her face as she glared at<br/>the screen in front of her. Things hadn't been going well for them<br/>lately. "What's wrong with Ranma? Why are we driving back the Youma<br/>Lords so easily? Why haven't we seen many of the weaker Youma?" Her<br/>face scrunched up in irritation. They had run into a few of the lesser<br/>monsters, but lately the things were alone. When they encountered the<br/>Youma Lords, it was as if they were operating independently of the<br/>other monsters. The lesser creatures were gathering energy, while the<br/>Youma Lords seemed more intent on making a big mess and causing<br/>casualties. "This doesn't add up."<p>"Thinking again?" asked Nephrite as he strolled into the room and<br/>sat on the edge of her desk.<p>Akane glanced up at him and her frown deepened. "A lot of what's<br/>going on isn't adding up," she replied carefully.<p>"We'd noticed that too, I think Ranma knows more than he's letting<br/>on, but he isn't talking."<p>The girl sighed at this, but nodded her head. "You're right.<br/>Ranma's been keeping to himself lately. He doesn't even go to school."<p>"Speaking of which..." said Nephrite playfully.<p>"Yeah, I know. I should get going," replied the girl with a<br/>slightly tired sigh.<p>"Right," agreed the man with a somewhat cheerful smirk.<p>Akane closed down her computer and stood up to go to the<br/>transporter room. It was still early in the morning, and she hadn't<br/>gotten more than an hour's worth of sleep in the past few days.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>"My baby!" cried Soun as Akane walked into the door and found<br/>herself tackled by her father in a rough hug.<p>"DAAAAADDDD!" muttered the girl in embarrassment.<p>"Oh! You're home Akane!" exclaimed Nabiki.<p>Genma snorted at her. "Where is that worthless son of mine?"<p>"I haven't seen him since last night," replied the girl as she<br/>gave him an unreadable gaze.<p>Genma nodded at this, his interest was minimal at the moment.<br/>"What about your sister?"<p>Akane shook her head. "Still no sign of her."<p>Soun hung his head, he had brightened up slightly at the mention<br/>of it, but it faded in an instant at Akane's answer.<p>The girl frowned at him a little. "Don't worry Dad, we'll find<br/>him."<p>Soun nodded silently and shuffled back to the table.<p>Kasumi fretted worriedly and gave her little sister somewhat<br/>nervous glances. "Akane, are you sure you can..."<p>"I trust these people more than anyone," she replied as she gave<br/>her sister a very slightly irritated glance. "One way or another, we<br/>will find her."<p>"All right," said the older girl as she turned away. Akane<br/>wouldn't talk about her job, or the people there at all. She defended<br/>their trust with an unwavering consistency though. Truth be told, she<br/>was somewhat envious of her sister for having people she thought she<br/>could trust that much. It also worried her slightly that she did trust<br/>these people as much as she did.<p>"The boy is slacking off," growled Genma as he looked at the dojo.<br/>It hadn't been used by anyone in a very long time.<p>Akane frowned at this, but ignored the man. He seemed somewhat<br/>irritable when speaking about his son, but that was normal anyway.<br/>Ranma seemed to have left him alone and gone off to live his own life,<br/>and Nodoka hadn't been around either. She was trying to kill him<br/>before, not it seemed like she had forgotten he existed at all. She<br/>hadn't seen her 'Auntie' for some time now. Genma was miserable<br/>without any contact from his family, and Ranma hadn't actually been to<br/>the dojo in almost a week.<p>"Poor guy," she muttered as she turned to go to her room, she<br/>could worry about it later, as it was now, she had to get ready for<br/>school.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Today's the day?" asked one of the two teens that stood outside<br/>the dojo. He had spiky black hair and a serious frown on his face as<br/>he glared at the door.<p>"That's right," agreed his companion. He was a boy of about the<br/>same age, his face was a cold and seemingly indifferent, and his long<br/>brown bangs hid his face from view. "It all starts today."<p>"We rest while we can then, we don't know when the next time we'll<br/>be able too after he finds out about us," replied the shorthaired boy.<p>His companion nodded silently.<p>"What are you two talking about? Who are you?" growled Pluto as<br/>she appeared behind them with a cold frown on her face. "What are you<br/>doing here?"<p>"You'll see," said the shorthaired boy as he smirked at her.<br/>"Later Puu!" He seemed to vanish into thin air.<p>The longhaired boy watched her for a moment with a smirk on his<br/>face. "Don't you have somewhere else to be Pluto?"<p>The woman scowled at him angrily. "I..."<p>"She's waiting for you, stop being a chicken and go see your<br/>daughter," replied the boy as he vanished as well.<p>The woman stared at the space they had once occupied and gave a<br/>frustrated snort. "What do they know...I..." She hung her head in<br/>shame. "I can't face her yet..."<p>"That's too bad, mother," said a calm voice from behind her.<p>Pluto slowly turned and gasped. Tsuki was standing behind her with<br/>the coldest frown she'd ever seen on the girl's face. "Tsuki..."<p>"Mother," replied the girl icily.<p>"What?" muttered Pluto as she stared at the girl's dress. She was<br/>wearing her senshi uniform and had a familiar object in her grip.<p>"Pluto!" said Pluto as she stepped back.<p>"That's right. You're going to retire soon," replied the girl in<br/>front of her calmly. "And you're going to leave those two alone."<p>"What?" gasped the elder Pluto in shock.<p>"In any case, they are right. You can't avoid me forever, Mother,"<br/>the younger Pluto gave her an unreadable smirk.<p>"I...I can't face her yet! She..."<p>"I've already heard all your excuses about this," replied Tsuki<br/>calmly as she turned away.<p>"What are you doing here? Our responsibility..." said the elder<br/>Pluto as she stepped forward.<p>"Responsibility be damned!" snarled Tsuki. "I will not... I<br/>cannot allow that future!"<p>"But..."<p>"Are you any better?" replied Tsuki calmly.<p>Pluto stared at her for a moment, with her jaw hanging down. "Well<br/>I..."<p>Tsuki snorted. "Crystal Tokyo indeed..."<p>"I'll have you know that..."<p>"I've heard all your excuses for that mess," said Tsuki as she<br/>smirked at her.<p>"Mess?" cried Setsuna in shock. "I'll have you know, young lady,<br/>that I..."<p>"Look where your 'Crystal Tokyo' has gotten you now," said Tsuki<br/>calmly.<p>Setsuna had no reply to that.<p>"Mother, go home. There's little you or I can do now. Just...go<br/>home." The younger Pluto started to walk away and turned to smile at<br/>her. "Remember what I've said. You won't see me again."<p>Setsuna nodded slowly and stepped back.<p>"Stay out of the way, this is beyond even you," said Tsuki as she<br/>vanished into a porthole that lead into the time stream.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Tsuki bowed deeply before a great throne and leveled her gaze on<br/>the woman sitting in front of her. "Yes my Queen."<p>"Good," replied the woman calmly. She leaned forward and smiled at<br/>Tsuki in an almost motherly way. Her long pink hair flowed down to the<br/>floor and cascaded down the stairs that lead up to the seat slightly.<br/>"So, we have ensured our future?"<p>"That's up to them," replied Tsuki calmly. "I cannot interfere any<br/>more than I have."<p>"Very well, I have faith in those two," replied the woman calmly.<br/>Her gaze turned to the window that led outside. The sky was a deep<br/>red, and the city below was shrouded in shadow from the dawn.<p>Tsuki made a small snort as she watched Chibi-Usa stand and walk<br/>towards the door. Her tail was coiled around her waist and she had a<br/>slightly vicious air to her smirk. She fingered the crystal that<br/>rested inside her brooch idly and left her in the throne room alone.<br/>"I think I'll go see if Ryo-chan want's to play."<p>Tsuki stood up after she left, that woman still bothered her.<br/>Still, at least she had a position to hold after all this time. With a<br/>heavy sigh she hung her head and opened another porthole. Pluto was<br/>long gone, but the time gates had been rebuilt at least. Now residing<br/>on Phobos, one of the two artificial satellites created in the Silver<br/>Millenium in order to restore the lunar balance after Diamos was<br/>destroyed by Genaku all those years ago.<p>"Bastard," thought Tsuki irritably as she remembered the man<br/>responsible for the destruction of the planet. Ranma Saotome would get<br/>what was coming to him, unfortunately, she had nothing to do with it.<br/>It was still somewhat comforting to think about it though.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Hotaru glared at the thing in front of her as it giggled madly and<br/>cocked its head at her. "Well, are you just going to stand there? I<br/>might get bored and decide to just blow up the planet."<p>Tenchi growled angrily at this and stepped back.<p>"Ryoko, it's time," said Hotaru calmly.<p>The woman blinked at her and didn't seem to understand for a<br/>moment.<p>"Get ready," said Hotaru as she walked up beside the woman.<p>Buu frowned and stepped back. Hotaru's power was actually<br/>dropping? Something wasn't right. The other woman's power was rising,<br/>but Hotaru was far superior. "What are you doing?" it grumbled to<br/>itself.<p>Tenchi moved in front of them and put his hands up, the Wings of<br/>the Light Hawk came to life and he frowned at the thing for a moment.<p>"You're going to fight me? Don't be absurd!" guffawed Buu.<p>"No, my job is to keep you away, I'm not strong enough to fight<br/>you," said the boy simply. He shook his head from side to side slowly.<p>"What?" muttered Buu in confusion.<p>Hotaru and Ryoko were standing next to each other in a ready pose.<br/>Buu blinked when they started to dance. "What the hell? Have they gone<br/>insane?" He grunted as he was forced to shield his eyes as a bright<br/>flash of light filled his vision. "Argh!"<p>What emerged from the flash was definitely something different.<br/>"Fusion dance?" he muttered as he stared at the woman before him.<p>"Heh. That's right monster," said the dual voice of the figure<br/>floating in front of him. She had a thick mane of spiky dark blue<br/>hair, a long slender body, and a pair of violet eyes. Her smirk was<br/>cold, and her face looked very youthful despite her figure. "I am<br/>Ryokaru, and you're dead meat." She pointed at the thing with a brash<br/>confidence in her tone.<p>"Heh," chuckled Buu. "It doesn't matter how strong you become.<br/>You'll never beat me!"<p>Ryokaru screamed as she flexed her arms at her sides and powered<br/>up. Within a few seconds time she had golden hair and deep blue eyes,<br/>not a new trick really. However, she paused for a moment and smirked<br/>at Buu. "Let's push it a bit further shall we?"<p>"Hurry up. I can't do this all day," grumbled Tenchi.<p>Ryokaru snorted at this, but nodded. "You're no fun Tenchi-chan."<p>The boy flushed at the name but remained focused on his shield.<p>Buu knew better than to try and break through the Wings of the<br/>Light hawk. He simply watched and waited.<p>Ryokaru grunted in effort and screamed again as her power rose<br/>even further. "Haaaaa!" She had grown larger, more muscular, and her<br/>hair was slightly larger and had more pronounced spikes in it. "Level<br/>two!" she said as she glared at Buu.<p>"Are you finished yet?" said Buu and Tenchi at the same time.<p>Tenchi blushed and Buu frowned at him. "I know where this is going<br/>you know. Just go to level three so we can start!"<p>"Three?" said Ryokaru in confusion. "You mean there's a -third-<br/>level!" Her eyes were wide as she stared at the thing in front of<br/>her for a moment.<p>Buu worked his jaw open and closed dumbly. "You mean...you didn't<br/>know?"<p>"Great! I think I'll try!" said the woman cheerfully as she mulled<br/>over it for a moment. "I mean, I didn't think I could get much better<br/>than this, but now that you mention it, I do have a bit more room."<p>Buu slapped himself on the forehead.<p>Ryokaru grunted in effort, her hair pushed further and further<br/>down her back, finally stopping just above her feet. She had grown<br/>even larger and the golden power around her seemed to be almost too<br/>bright to look at. When it died down, her eyebrows were gone and she<br/>had an even more arrogant looking smirk on her face.<p>Tenchi gasped in shock as the Wings of the Light Hawk shattered as<br/>he was thrown forward and landed at Buu's feet. He scrambled away as<br/>quickly as he could, aware of the surging wave of power that poured<br/>off the figure behind him. "No way!" he stammered.<p>Buu was too busy staring at the thing in front of him to care<br/>about Tenchi. "This is...great!"<p>Even Ryokaru had to pause at that.<p>"A real fight at last! Come on!" said Buu as he charged forward.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane walked into the gates of Furinkan High in her school<br/>uniform. It was quiet and relatively normal for the most part. The<br/>level of excitement had dropped dramatically since Ranma had stopped<br/>attending. She had briefly considered halting her education until the<br/>threat had passed, but the pigtailed boy had insisted that she<br/>continue. She supposed he was right, but she had been forced to cut<br/>several times due to an attack. Luckily, her memory eraser made that a<br/>little easier to deal with.<p>She glanced around the grounds for a moment, not really paying<br/>much attention. When she reached the tree where Kuno usually emerged,<br/>she paused and sighed. "Another day."<p>"Akane Tendo," said a familiar voice from behind the trunk.<p>"Kuno, good morning," she said lazily.<p>"Today is the day I prove my love to you at last, by defeating you<br/>in honorable combat." The boy stepped from behind the trunk and smiled<br/>at her.<p>Akane sighed, she didn't care much for Kuno, but the battle with<br/>him in the morning was actually beneficial to her. Her skills were<br/>kept sharp, no doubt saving her more than once on the job. "Come on<br/>then, let's get started." She smirked to herself as she prepared<br/>herself. She knew that Kuno was no longer able to hold back against<br/>her. Her skill had grown too much over the past few months. Battling<br/>Youma will do that to a person, especially without the benefit of<br/>magic to help her. She almost wished Kuno was strong enough to take a<br/>few blasts, then she might have been able to use this as target<br/>practice as well.<p>"Today, shall truly be our final battle," said Kuno as he narrowed<br/>his eyes at the girl. His wooden sword was held ready and he gave her<br/>a smile that was a little more vicious than normal.<p>"Yeah, I wish," she grumbled under her breath.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Two boys stood outside the gates watching the scene. The<br/>longhaired boy turned to his companion and smirked. "So, this is where<br/>it all begins?"<p>"Right, get ready," replied the spiky haired youth.<p>"I've been ready for this for a long time," replied his companion.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Akane avoided a quick strike from the older boy with his wooden<br/>blade, it was getting easier and easier to beat him. The girl casually<br/>sidestepped a blow from above and planted her fist in his gut, sending<br/>the older boy doubling over in pain. Kuno fell to his knees and gasped<br/>for breath.<p>"Humph, you're not even worth my time these days Kuno," said the<br/>girl as she snorted and started to walk away.<p>"Hold! The battle is not yet finished my love!" said Kuno as he<br/>staggered to his feet and smiled at her weakly.<p>Akane frowned, the boy wasn't usually smiling after a blow like<br/>that. Something was up, and she was getting a chill down her spine.<p>"Your skills grow ever stronger my love, almost equal to mine!"<br/>exalted the boy with tears in his eyes. "Truly a match by the gods<br/>themselves! Today is the day that I prove my love and allow you to<br/>date me at last!" Kuno reached into his shirt.<p>Akane gasped at the sight of the wooden mask the boy pulled from<br/>inside his robes. A memory trickled into her mind, she had seen the<br/>mask before, and the result of its power. "How did he...?"<p>Before she could react, Kuno had placed the mask on his face. It<br/>seemed to liquefy as it absorbed his head and began to turn green.<br/>After a moment, thunder rumbled in the sky above and dark clouds<br/>appeared out of nowhere.<p>"Kuno! Where did you get that!" demanded Akane angrily.<p>"No!" cried Gosunkugi as he staggered out of the nearby bushes<br/>with a panicked looking face. "Kuno! You don't know what you're<br/>doing!" Akane spared him a passing glance but quickly focused her<br/>attention on the Kendoist.<p>The figure that had once been Tatewaki Kuno laughed; it was a<br/>horrible sound. "I, the Mighty Blue Thunder of Furinkan High, shall<br/>defeat you at last! Then we shall be joined as one!" His face was<br/>sharper than the familiar figure that had worn it before. Kuno had<br/>become more muscular and a wild fire burned in his eyes, a lust a<br/>thousand times greater than Akane had known before.<p>"Oh shit," she muttered as she stepped back.<p>Kuno dove forward, his sword lashed out at her and she jumped<br/>away. The speed was incredible, Kuno shattered the ground, creating a<br/>huge crack in the earth where she had once stood. "Fear not Akane<br/>Tendo! We shall be wed this very day!"<p>The girl staggered back and kicked at the thing, her foot impacted<br/>on his chest and she was thrown to the ground by the force of her own<br/>strike. Kuno hadn't even felt it.<p>"A love tap," said Kuno as tears began to form in his eyes. He<br/>reached for her as she lay on the ground. "Come my darling! Let us..."<p>Akane screamed as the thing puckered up its lips as it held her<br/>down with one arm on her shoulder. "What are you doing! Get away!"<p>If Kuno heard her, he didn't react. He forced his lips onto hers<br/>as she struggled.<p>Akane couldn't move, she struggled and tried to throw him off, but<br/>it was as if he was rooted to the ground. He pressed his body down<br/>against hers as he kissed her. "At last, I have conquered my tigress!"<br/>he lamented as he broke the kiss. "I have accepted her innocent kiss!<br/>Now, I shall make her mine forever!"<p>The student body looked on in horror at the scene. Akane was<br/>struggling harder than ever, but couldn't muster the strength to<br/>remove the boy from on top of her. No one moved, whether it was out of<br/>fear or disbelief no one could really say. Finally, one of the girls<br/>stepped forward.<p>"No! What is he doing?" A ripping sound seemed to fill the air as<br/>Akane's shirt started too rip off.<p>The girl went very still suddenly, the right side of her bra<br/>exposed suddenly as the green headed monster tore though the top of<br/>her uniform with a quick tug.<p>Akane froze, her struggling ceased quite suddenly.<p>Kuno had tears of joy in his eyes as he looked at her. "Oh! You<br/>accept me!"<p>"Get off me," said the girl firmly. There was a flash of light<br/>from between their bodies. A spray of red showered the air behind<br/>Kuno's back and the boy blinked at her. He sat up slightly, still<br/>pinning her to the ground, surprise clear on his features.<p>Akane managed to free her arms and was now holding a chrome-plated<br/>weapon against his chin. A look of complete rage was clear on her<br/>features. "Bastard."<p>"It seems there is a spell keeping your heart from expressing its<br/>true feelings! I know a way to break this spell," said Kuno as he<br/>grinned at her. His crotch pressed up against hers.<p>Akane's eyes narrowed as she felt his arousal, she pulled the<br/>trigger on the weapon and Kuno's head went flying away. It landed<br/>against a nearby tree.<p>Akane gasped as the body remained still, keeping her against the<br/>ground. The head rolled upright on its own and frowned at her.<br/>"Forgive me Akane Tendo, the spell must be broken."<p>"No!" screamed the girl as she renewed her struggles as Kuno<br/>started to grab what was left of her clothing.<p>The student body would not approach the scene. Fear and horror<br/>were now the only reactions. The scene before them would be the stuff<br/>of nightmares for years to come.<p>"I think that's about enough of that, Loki," said a calm voice<br/>from the gates.<p>"Eh?" said Kuno's head as it turned to glare at the boy who stood<br/>glaring at him.<p>The body froze as it tugged on Akane's bra and she gasped as she<br/>turned to look at the stranger.<p>"Who the hell are you?" said Kuno's head.<p>The boy had short spiky black hair and a smirk on his face. "My<br/>name? I don't give it to just anyone..."<p>"Stuff it Gohan! We don't have time for this!" said the other boy<br/>as he walked up to his companion's side.<p>"Why you!" snarled the boy angrily.<p>"Rice? That guy's name is Rice?" muttered one of the nearby<br/>students in confusion.<p>"Damn it Trunks!" snapped Gohan irritably as he seemed to forget<br/>about the scene in front of him for a moment.<p>"Bastard! How dare you call me that!" snapped Trunks angrily.<p>Kuno rolled his eyes and forced his body to continue what it was<br/>doing.<p>The two boys snapped out of their stupor and glared at the thing<br/>hatefully.<p>"Let's kick his ass," said Gohan.<p>"We're going to have a long talk about this later," growled Trunks<br/>irritably.<p>"Damn right we are!" agreed Gohan.<p>Akane never knew what hit her after that was said, but she knew<br/>Kuno wasn't on top of her anymore. She blinked and staggered to her<br/>feet, holding her uniform closed with one arm and gripping the weapon<br/>in her hand with the other. "Who the hell are you?" she grumbled as<br/>she stared at the pair for a moment, daring to take her attention away<br/>from Kuno for a moment.<p>"We'll discuss this later, right now, we've got bigger problems,"<br/>said Trunks as he frowned at Kuno's prone body. The boy was standing<br/>right next to Akane with a scowl on his face.<p>The thing had found its head again and was glaring at the pair.<br/>Its body was now undamaged and power seemed to burn around it.<p>"He's too strong," growled Akane. "We're going to need help."<p>"Nah, we got it covered," said Trunks as he smirked at her.<p>Gohan appeared at his side and smacked him in the back of his<br/>head. "Have you forgotten who you're talking too? Quit flirting and<br/>kill the monster."<p>"Flirting?" muttered Akane dumbly.<p>"Right," muttered Trunks in embarrassment.<p>"Face the wrath of the Blue Thunder of Furninkan High!" roared<br/>Kuno as he charged.<p>"Not today Loki!" snapped Gohan as he met the charge head on.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Tenchi stared at the thing above them and watched the fight.<br/>Ryokaru was fighting Buu full force. Her blows rained down on the<br/>creature and it seemed to be something of a standoff.<p>"Get him!" he growled as he waited patiently. Buu still had a<br/>stupid grin on his face, while Ryokaru's face was much more serious.<p>"Damn! No matter how hard she hits him, it doesn't seem to hurt<br/>him!" grumbled Tenchi. "What's going on? He doesn't feel that strong!"<br/>The boy's mind worked on the problem. "I'm missing something! I know<br/>it, but what?"<p>Ryokaru spun into a kick that slammed into Buu's head, sending him<br/>spinning away in the air. The thing slammed into the surface of the<br/>planet, seeming to conform and flatten against the ground for a moment<br/>before bouncing back. "Heh. Pathetic. You can't hurt me."<p>"Damn!" growled the woman as she glared at it. Her eyes flicked<br/>towards Tenchi for a second. He was a good distance away, and Buu<br/>couldn't hurt him as long as he was being distracted. The boy's Light<br/>Hawk Wings should easily block anything sent towards the boy. However,<br/>she also knew that he couldn't really help her.<p>"Have you figured it out yet? You're running out of time," said<br/>Buu calmly as he smirked at her.<p>"Damn," growled Ryokaru. The monster was right, she had about five<br/>minutes of fusion left. "I've got to do something! After this fails,<br/>we're all screwed!"<p>Buu formed a ball of pink light in his hand and grinned at her.<br/>"It's over." He paused as he noticed the light in his hand flicker<br/>slightly. It was a weak energy. "But...the planet's power is..." His<br/>eyes went wide as he realized that the power he was using was<br/>concentrated on a single point now. "Impossible!"<p>"RYOKARU! GET OUT OF THERE! SPIRIT BOMB!" cried a voice from above<br/>them.<p>"WHAT?" cried Buu in shock as he turned his head towards the sky.<br/>Hidden in the sun a figure floated smiling at him. A ki ball the size<br/>of a starship floated above his head. "Damn it!"<p>Trunks laughed as he launched his attack. The sphere of ki<br/>rocketed towards Buu and slammed into the ground with explosive force.<br/>The creature screamed in agony as it writhed within the light.<p>"HA!" chuckled Trunks as he concentrated the attack on a single<br/>point. "We may not be able to hurt you with a punch, but I sure as<br/>hell can evaporate you Buu!"<p>"What?" said Ryokaru as she paused and watched the scene from a<br/>short distance away. The Spirit Bomb turned a bright red color and the<br/>thing's screams grew weaker from inside. "How did?"<p>Tenchi was watching her and smiling slightly. "It's working!"<p>Trunks finally unleashed the attack and it exploded outwards.<br/>Sending shockwaves away from the surface of the planet in every<br/>direction.<p>Ryoko, Tenchi, and Trunks struggled against the energy as it<br/>blasted outwards. Sending a ring of power blasting away from the<br/>planet's surface and into space. When it all cleared, they were lying<br/>on the ground in the dust.<p>Trunks staggered to his feet first and smirked. "It worked!"<p>"What the hell?" grumbled Ryoko as she stood up next, Hotaru was<br/>beside her clutching her head.<p>"Oooh, what happened?" muttered the younger girl.<p>"You didn't really think I was stupid enough to use all my power<br/>at once do you?" replied Trunks calmly as he glanced at the trio.<p>"But you..." stammered Tenchi.<p>"I used most of my energy for that blast, but I held back a<br/>little. I needed Buu to think I wasn't a threat, that attack takes a<br/>very long time to charge."<p>"But, we blasted him before, your attack didn't even hurt him!"<br/>said Ryoko dumbly. "He just fixed himself and..."<p>"My attack never hit him, none of the blasts we used did," replied<br/>Trunks as he shook his head. "The reason we couldn't hurt Buu is<br/>simple, he was never solid."<p>"What?" said Hotaru. She blinked and looked at her fist for a<br/>moment. "But, I felt my fist connect."<p>"It's pretty simple. You were moving so fast that his body felt<br/>solid when you hit it. We were trying to beat a puddle of water to<br/>death. If we had used a slow attack, we would have passed right<br/>through him."<p>"Like the blasts?" asked Tenchi.<p>"Sort of, he was just making holes in himself for them to pass<br/>through. The Spirit Bomb was too big for him to do that. It took me<br/>the longest time to figure that out. I noticed the ripples in his body<br/>when he was fighting Ryokaru. From the front end you couldn't see it,<br/>but if you looked at his back, he was always spattering everywhere."<p>"Come to think of it, she was always between me and him, for the<br/>whole fight!" commented Tenchi.<p>"Right," said Trunks as he smirked at them. "I bided my time and<br/>played dead for a few minutes. Once Buu started to ignore me, I went<br/>into the sky and started collecting power for the Spirit Bomb. I had<br/>to stop whenever he tried to use a Ki blast, so he wouldn't notice me<br/>using his power source. Once I had finished, it was too late for him<br/>to do anything about it."<p>"So, what happened to him?" asked Tenchi. "I don't see anything<br/>left."<p>"He evaporated, not even he can recover from that. It took an<br/>enormous amount of power for him to recover from just blowing himself<br/>into little pieces."<p>"So, we did it?" asked Tenchi in shock.<p>"Yeah, we did. Hang around me a bit more, and you'll get used to<br/>it," said Trunks as he winked at the boy and started walking away.<p>Hotaru sighed with relief and started after him.<p>"Where the heck are we going?" asked Ryoko as she glanced up at<br/>the sky and saw the flaming trails of the populace of the planet<br/>returning into the atmosphere.<p>"Where else? We gotta go back and meet everyone," said Trunks as<br/>he smirked at her. "We've still got a lot of work to do, Jurai is safe<br/>now, so we can get back on schedule."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Kuno roared in anger as he found his arms held back by the<br/>mysterious figure. The boy was smiling at him as he pushed against the<br/>monster's arms.<p>"Fool! You cannot defeat me!" snapped the angry boy.<p>"Heh, you've already lost," said Gohan with his smirk widening. He<br/>felt his arms being pushed back by the sheer power of the god within<br/>the mask, but he wasn't really trying to overpower him.<p>Trunks appeared behind Kuno and dug his fingers into the back of<br/>the mask. "Show's over!"<p>"What? No!" screamed the thing as it struggled to free itself from<br/>Gohan's grip. It was too late though, Trunks ripped the thing open and<br/>pried it away from Kuno's face.<p>Within a few seconds, the Kendoist was lying on the ground gasping<br/>for breath. The mask was shoved into a small leather pouch on the<br/>longhaired boy's belt.<p>"You dare!" snarled Kuno as he rose to his feet.<p>Gohan promptly decked him. The boy flew through the air and passed<br/>through the wall of the school with a loud crash. "Jerk! How dare he<br/>try something like that in front of everyone!"<p>"It was the mask Gohan, the mask," said Trunks with a small sigh.<p>The student body was giving them a wide berth as they strolled<br/>back over to Akane.<p>"Undressing that Ghoul in front of me? I won't forgive him!" said<br/>Gohan in disgust.<p>Akane stepped forward with a shocked expression on her face.<br/>"Trunks? Gohan? Who...who are you?"<p>The pair turned to look at her and blinked.<p>"Um, hello Akane Sensei," said Trunks sheepishly.<p>"Hey Ghoul!" said Gohan cheerfully.<p>Trunks smacked the boy in the back of his head.<p>"Sensei?" muttered Akane as she stared at him.<p>"Yeah, we got a lot to explain and not much time. We need to meet<br/>with the others, before Ranma finds out we're here," said Gohan with a<br/>serious looking frown on his face.<p>"Right," agreed Trunks.<p>"Others?" muttered Akane with a suspicious frown.<p>"We're from the future," said Gohan as he frowned at her. "We've<br/>been sent back in time to make sure you stay alive."<p>Akane blinked at this and stared at them. "Say what?"<p>"Well, that and I need to kick that old man's ass for naming me<br/>Trunks. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a date with a name<br/>like this?"<p>"Hey, I'm not much worse off than you are," grumbled Gohan. "What<br/>kind of idiot names you after a meal?" The two boys grinned at each<br/>other and cracked their knuckles.<p>"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA! Revenge at last!" they cried in unison.<p>Akane just stared at them.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...
