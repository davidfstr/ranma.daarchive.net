</div>Insertion<p>Part 1<p>How the whole mess started...<p>+++++++++<p>Forward.<p>This idea came to me after reading, Messed Up, Nuke Em Till They<br/>Glow, and thinking about another fanfic idea I had a while back. I<br/>always wanted to write something that was completely off the wall<br/>insane. I still think Nuke Em Till They Glow, is probably the funniest<br/>piece of fanfiction I've ever read in my life, but that's just me.<br/>Anyway, you'll catch on to this one pretty quickly, and it's probably<br/>the most original Self Insertion Parody you'll see for a long time to<br/>come.<p>+++++++++++<p>A familiar scene, Jusenkyo, in the Bayankala mountain range of<br/>China. Ranma Saotome trading blows with his father over the quiet<br/>pools of water, atop bamboo chutes that jut from the small ponds.<p>Two fanfic writers, typing the exact same opening, to two<br/>different stories. They moved in tandem, their hands working on the<br/>keys in perfect unison, even though neither of them knows who the<br/>other is. Things like this happen on occasion, it is rare indeed. The<br/>chances are similar to those of a monkey writing out the complete<br/>works of Shakespeare.<p>Few people realize it, but almost all works of fiction are self-<br/>insertions on some level. Whether it is a wish for a better world, or<br/>a craving for a life of adventure that the author will never have, is<br/>uncertain. It is possible that it is just the venting of frustrations,<br/>played out upon someone who cannot retaliate in any way, no one person<br/>has the same motivation.<p>On some level, a small portion of the author's soul is taken and<br/>placed into the story, perhaps becoming a reality in some distant<br/>universe. The mechanics of such things is uncertain, however, this<br/>time, something different happened.<p>Whether the Kami of said universe had an unusual sense of humor, or<br/>was unaware that these two tales were completely different is, and<br/>shall always be, a mystery. The Kami have a way of blowing off<br/>mistakes of that kind as some sort of grand scheme.<p>In any case, all that mattered was the fact that it happened. As<br/>Ranma fell into the pool that would change his destiny forever, two<br/>souls attempted to merge with his own, in order to exact the changes<br/>that would carry their tales.<p>Inside Ranma's head, a sound echoed for a moment. It was almost<br/>like the sound of two coconuts colliding together on some astral<br/>level. How the astral coconuts had arrived at their destination is<br/>uncertain as well. Whether they were carried by two astral swallows<br/>could remain in debate for eons to come, as well as whether said<br/>swallows were of the African variety, or the European kind. Such<br/>things are best left to philosophers anyway.<p>As Ranma broke the surface of the water, gasping for air, said two<br/>coconuts were rubbing their foreheads and cursing under their breath.<br/>It was quite a confusing scene for all involved.<p>The young Saotome was unaware of these proceedings thus far, and<br/>promptly screamed as she glanced down at the new additions to her<br/>chest. Thus, the chase began. Seeking vengeance for the blunder, Ranma<br/>began to tear across the Chinese wilderness after his, now her,<br/>father.<p>As she left the land surrounding the springs, chasing her father<br/>up the side of a mountain path, a voice suddenly cried out from within<br/>her.<p>"HOLD IT!"<p>Ranma felt her body stop cold, and blinked in shocked surprise.<br/>"Who?"<p>"What the hell is going on here!" cried a different voice from<br/>within his head.<p>"I'm going to kill my pop! That's what!" answered Ranma out loud,<br/>not yet realizing that there was a voice speaking to her from inside<br/>her head.<p>"Who the heck are you?" said another voice from her head.<p>"Ranma Saotome," replied the redhead dumbly as she started to<br/>glance around in search of the pair. "Where the heck are you? Come out<br/>so I can see you!" she demanded.<p>"I know who you are!" snapped the second voice at her. "I was<br/>talking to the other guy inside our head."<p>Ranma blinked, not quite certain what to say or do.<p>"Who the heck are you?" said the first voice indignantly.<p>"I asked first!" snapped the second voice angrily.<p>"I've gone nuts! Snapped!" muttered Ranma as she fell to her knees<br/>clutching her head. Her eyes wide with terror as she rocked back and<br/>fourth. Finally she stood up and turned towards where her father had<br/>run off too. "Pop! This is all your fault! I'm gonna kill you!"<p>"Stop!" cried one of the voices, and her body suddenly became<br/>still.<p>"Yeah! We aren't going anywhere until we get this mess figured<br/>out!" said the other voice in agreement.<p>"Fine, I'll start then. My name is Dan Hibiki," said the first<br/>voice.<p>"It is?" said the second voice. He started to laugh out loud,<br/>almost causing Ranma to fall over. She had no idea what it was she<br/>found so funny.<p>"Shut up! It's not my fault!" snapped Dan angrily.<p>"I guess not, man, your parents are cruel. Naming you after the<br/>worst street fighter ever," said the second voice as it slowly calmed<br/>to the occasional chuckle.<p>"I was born before that!" retorted the angry Dan bitterly.<p>"Whatever, people call me Carrot," said the second voice with a<br/>shrug.<p>Ranma felt her shoulders move and blinked in surprise. "Um, could<br/>you stop that?"<p>"Not sure how," said Carrot with another shrug. "I think we're<br/>stuck like this for a while."<p>"We?" muttered Ranma in shock.<p>"Yup, there's three of us in here now," said Carrot after a<br/>moment's thought. "At least I think there's three of us, if there is<br/>someone else, they ain't said nuthin."<p>"Was this because of that spring?" muttered Ranma as her eyes went<br/>wide with shock again.<p>"Could be," ventured Carrot lazily. "Come on, we'd best get back.<br/>I think the guide might have some hot water back at his hut."<p>"What good will that do us?" snapped Ranma angrily.<p>"It's the cure for the curse," said Dan with a slight annoyance in<br/>his voice. "We'll turn back into a guy again, and then make panda<br/>steaks."<p>"Right," agreed Carrot cheerfully.<p>"You seem to be taking this well," commented Dan with a small<br/>frown.<p>Ranma's entire body was shaking, a cold fear gripped her heart as<br/>she stood up and started to slowly walk away. Hoping the voices would<br/>remain in the clearing, and this would all just be some sort of bad<br/>joke.<p>Unfortunately, that's not the way things worked. The pair<br/>continued to talk as she walked.<p>"It's this way," said Carrot as he forced Ranma to turn her body<br/>and moved in a different direction.<p>"No! This way!" the redhead's body twisted towards another path.<p>"No! We passed those trees over there, remember?" said Carrot as<br/>he pointed towards a small grove.<p>"Damn it! I know where I'm going!" muttered Dan angrily.<p>"Come on! Try to get along will ya? We don't know how long we're<br/>stuck like this!" pleaded Carrot. "We've got to try and be good<br/>roomies. Okay?"<p>"Roomies?" muttered Ranma in horror.<p>"Fine! We'll go your way! Don't come crying to me when we end up<br/>in India!" snapped Dan.<p>"Great!" said Carrot cheerfully. "So, how ya doin, Ranma?"<p>That did it. "How am I doing? I'm a friggin girl! I'm hearing two<br/>different voices inside my head, and I ain't walkin nowhere, but<br/>somehow I am! How the hell do you think I'm doin!"<p>"Jeez, calm down. There's no need to blow a gasket," said Carrot<br/>lazily.<p>"Calm down? CALM DOWN? Are you nuts?" snapped Ranma.<p>"Well, I guess I am a little, but that's beside the point," said<br/>Carrot with another small shrug. "Look, getting upset won't help<br/>anything, let's just go back to the Guide's house, and get some hot<br/>water. We'll be a man again at least."<p>"Right," agreed Dan.<p>"You mean...I don't have to stay a girl?" muttered Ranma in<br/>surprise, a great relief flooded her body suddenly.<p>"Ooh, that tingled," commented Carrot.<p>"Shut up!" snapped Dan.<p>"Who the heck are you?" said Ranma as she walked along, a little<br/>bit calmer than before.<p>"We already told you," said Carrot.<p>"I know that! How the heck did you get inside my head?" snapped<br/>Ranma angrily.<p>"I dunno," said Carrot.<p>"Beats the hell outta me," agreed Dan.<p>Ranma found herself trying to shrug her arms, and cross them at<br/>the same time.<p>"I'm just glad this girl thing is only temporary," muttered Ranma.<br/>If she was lucky, the voices would leave with the girl body.<p>"Actually, it's kinda permanent," muttered Carrot with a small<br/>chuckle.<p>"What?" said Ranma as she suddenly stopped in the middle of the<br/>path.<p>"Hot water changes us into a guy, cold water turns us into a girl.<br/>It's pretty simple really," said Carrot cheerfully. "Come on, how bad<br/>could it be?"<p>"I'm a guy!" snapped Ranma, desperately wishing she could beat the<br/>crap out of this guy.<p>"Will both of you just shut the hell up?" snapped Dan.<p>"Calm down will ya? All this arguing isn't going to get us<br/>anywhere," replied Carrot. "Look, being a girl has advantages. We can<br/>look at all the naked girls we want, without being called perverts. We<br/>can get free food, cause we're cute. We can do all sorts of things<br/>guys don't get to do, because it isn't macho. Like eat those girly<br/>ice-cream things, and play with dolls."<p>"You play with dolls?" muttered Ranma in disgusted shock.<p>"Huh? No! Of course not! But we could if we wanted too, and it<br/>wouldn't look weird. It was just an example."<p>"Yeah right," grumbled Dan with a smirk on his face.<p>"Let's not get snippy. I'm assuming that we both already know all<br/>about Ranma, but what about the two of us?" said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"What do you mean you know about me?" snapped the pigtailed girl<br/>angrily.<p>"You're the star of a manga back where we came from, that is, if<br/>Dan is from the same place I am," said Carrot lazily.<p>"Right," confirmed Dan with another frown.<p>"Man, what a grouch," muttered Carrot to himself, although, all of<br/>them heard him.<p>"You shut up you!" cried Dan as he punched himself in the face.<p>"Hey! Cut that out!" cried Ranma as she rubbed her nose.<p>"Ouch! You jerk!" snapped Carrot as he retaliated by twisting his<br/>own breast.<p>"So! You want to play rough do you?" retorted Dan angrily as he<br/>punched himself in the gut.<p>Genma Saotome, having realized that he wasn't being chased<br/>anymore, walked in on an unusual scene. His son, now turned daughter,<br/>was beating the living daylights out of herself, and cursing at<br/>herself as well. He paused and watched the scene for a moment, before<br/>turning away and holding a sign with the words, "I don't want to<br/>know," printed on it. He shuffled away through the brush quietly.<p>++++++++++<p>Half an hour later, Ranma was laid out on the ground, covered in<br/>bruises. "Are you two jerks done yet?" she muttered angrily. One of<br/>her hands was still weakly slapping her across her face, while the<br/>other had a weak grip on her neck, and was trying it's best to<br/>strangle her.<p>"Die!" cried Dan bitterly.<p>"Feel my fists of death!" muttered Carrot.<p>"That's enough!" snapped Ranma as she jumped to her feet. She<br/>paused and realized that she didn't feel tired at all. Her arms were<br/>moving like she was completely drained though, as they attempted to<br/>continue the battle. She was feeling quite sore despite the energy she<br/>still had.<p>"I'm done now," muttered Dan.<p>"That's enough," agreed Carrot.<p>"So, which one of you knows martial arts?" said Ranma calmly.<p>"Huh? I've got my second dan in kenpo," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"I don't know any," said Dan.<p>"Yeah, but you're a fighter," commented Ranma as she started<br/>walking again.<p>"I guess," grumbled Dan. "I prefer to have a good weapon in my<br/>hand to be honest."<p>"Like a sword?" asked Ranma. He seemed like the type who might<br/>know Kendo or something.<p>"No, like a 357 magnum," said Dan with a snort. "I was a cop, a<br/>part of the SWAT team in Denver."<p>"Where's Denver?" muttered Ranma in confusion.<p>"America, I'm from Jacksonville myself, in Florida," commented<br/>Carrot lazily.<p>"Let me get this straight. I've got two gaijin Assholes inside my<br/>head?" snapped Ranma in disgust.<p>"Yup, that's about the size of it," commented Carrot lazily. "Hey,<br/>I wanna blow something up."<p>"Shut up!" snapped Dan.<p>"Sorry, I've always wanted to say that," replied Carrot with a<br/>grin.<p>"We're here," commented Ranma as she noticed the Guide's hut up<br/>ahead.<p>"We'll end up in India, huh?" deadpanned Carrot with a smug<br/>looking grin.<p>"I'd kill you, but I'm too tired," snapped Dan.<p>"Come on, let's go all right?" muttered Ranma.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Ranma! Just you wait! I'll make you pay for running out on our<br/>duel!" cried Ryoga Hibiki as he staggered through the forest. He had<br/>made it safely past the cliff that overlooked Jusenkyo, and was now<br/>moving towards Europe.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Well?" said Ranma as he looked at his father in disgust.<p>"Boy, I don't know what you're talking about," said Genma from the<br/>ground. He looked like he had been beaten quite nicely.<p>"You stupid jerk! I turn into a girl, and I've got two voices<br/>talking to me inside my head! This is all your fault old man!"<p>"Sirs! I never hear of this happening before!" cried the Guide in<br/>concern.<p>"How often do people get cursed here?" snapped Ranma in a<br/>completely different tone as he turned to look at the man for a<br/>moment.<p>The guide stepped back and thought about it. "It not happen in<br/>many years. Maybe that why I not hear about it before?" he muttered<br/>sheepishly.<p>"Well, that's something I guess. Where is the spring of drowned<br/>man?" said Ranma again, with his tone changing again.<p>The guide blinked and looked at him in shock. "Sirs, no one ever<br/>ask that before after being cursed. You is first."<p>"Hey. Why didn't I think of that?" muttered Ranma with a blank<br/>look on his face.<p>"I so sorry to say, no can cure curse yet. Magic still very<br/>unstable, is dangerous. Must wait for many months before curse can be<br/>cured."<p>"Damn," muttered Ranma as his tone changed again.<p>He suddenly became cheerful again, "Oh well!" He put his hands on<br/>top of his head, and strolled away lazily.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Tendo, bringing Ranma from China. Saotome."<p>Soun Tendo sat at the table, with his daughters looking at him as<br/>if he had three heads.<p>A sound came from the front door, it was opened, and someone<br/>entered the home.<p>"Ooh! That must be Ranma!" cried Nabiki as she jumped to her feet.<p>"Saotome! My friend! I've been waiting!" cried Soun as he followed<br/>her into the hall. Akane and Kasumi were directly behind him. The two<br/>girls found themselves almost run over as Soun and Nabiki came running<br/>back into the room.<p>A giant Panda walked in, with a young girl directly in front of<br/>it.<p>"You wouldn't be?" ventured Soun.<p>The girl smiled at him cutely, pulling her hands up to her face<br/>and shaking her head from side to side. "Hi! I'm Ranma Saotome! Tee<br/>hee!"<p>Every Tendo in the room fell over.<p>Nabiki was the first to recover, she glared at her father for a<br/>moment. "Ranma is a girl."<p>"I can see that!" snapped Soun.<p>"A rather cute girl," continued Nabiki as she poked at the girl's<br/>breast.<p>"Ooh! Don't stop!" cried the redhead as she pulled the girl's hand<br/>by her wrist and forced her to grab the breast she had been poking.<p>Nabiki pulled her hand away in disgust and glared at the girl. She<br/>paused though, there was something in her eyes that bothered her<br/>slightly. They almost shined with a dangerous intelligence, and seemed<br/>to be flashing with anger. "There's more to her than this airhead,"<br/>she thought to herself for a moment.<p>Soun looked at the homoerotic display for a moment, and passed out<br/>on the ground.<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma was sitting at the table with the Tendos, seeming to beam<br/>with pride as the panda glared at her angrily. None of the Tendos<br/>noticed this, as they were focused on Soun's prone form on the ground<br/>just beside the table. He had a cold cloth sitting across his<br/>forehead, and tears in his eyes.<p>"This is all your fault daddy!" said Nabiki.<p>"Well I assumed that my friend Saotome's son was a boy!" snapped<br/>the man in retort.<p>"Hey! Aren't you going to cop another feel?" said Ranma as she<br/>turned her head towards Nabiki and grabbed the girl's hand, pulling it<br/>to her chest again.<p>"Stop that!" cried Nabiki as she pulled her hand away and blushed.<p>The girl's expression became serious all of a sudden. "Fine."<p>"Who the heck are you?" said Akane as she eyed the girl nervously.<p>"I thought we covered this," said the redhead as she flicked her<br/>ponytail over her shoulder and smiled. "I'm Ranma Saotome. You want to<br/>be friends? Don't worry, I'm just pulling your sister's chain for<br/>poking my chest earlier. I'm not really gay, well, not in a literal<br/>sense anyway."<p>Akane wasn't certain what to make of that comment, finally, she<br/>smiled at the girl weakly. "Um, sure..."<p>+++++++++++<p>A few moments later, the pair were out in the dojo.<p>"So, I hear you practice kenpo?"<p>"Yup," said Ranma lazily.<p>Akane was unnerved a bit by how quickly the girl's expressions<br/>changed. She seemed to almost be feeling three things at one time. She<br/>pushed the thought aside and smiled warmly. "Well, let's have a match<br/>then!"<p>The redhead's smile widened slightly. "All right. I like to punch<br/>stuff."<p>"Huh?" muttered Akane in shock.<p>"Well, I like other things too, like kicking things, and<br/>explosions..."<p>"Um, right," said Akane as she took up a ready stance.<p>+++++++++<p>"You're up Ranma," said Carrot cheerfully inside the redhead's<br/>brain.<p>"Try not to insult her," agreed Dan with a small scowl.<p>"Shut up! Are you sure we can get out of this engagement thing?"<br/>said Ranma nervously.<p>"Nope," said Dan flatly.<p>"Not a clue," chimed Carrot cheerfully.<p>"Well, I still think we should have stayed in China. That Shampoo<br/>was a babe!" said Dan.<p>"Are you nuts? She was tryin to kill us!" replied Ranma.<p>"Only at first," commented Dan. "Besides, I've got other plans."<p>"Hey, lets beat the crap out of her!" said Carrot merrily.<p>"What? No way!" cried Ranma.<p>"I say we crush her like a bug," agreed Dan.<p>++++++++<p>Outside the brain, the fight had already started.<p>"What's wrong? Attack me!" cried Akane as she spun into a kick.<p>"Huh?" muttered Ranma as her expression changed suddenly. "If you<br/>say so..."<p>Akane was flat on her back a half second later. The redhead had<br/>her arm extended still and was looking down at her absently. "Ouch.<br/>What the hell just happened?" Akane was feeling sore spots in at least<br/>six different places.<p>"Are you all right? I didn't hit you too hard did I?" said the<br/>redhead as she knelt down beside her.<p>"No, you're pretty good," commented Akane as she sat up and shook<br/>her head. She couldn't even remember what had happened to her.<p>"Pretty good?" said Ranma with an amused look in her eyes.<p>"Okay, you're really good," amended Akane with a smile forming on<br/>her lips. "I'm just glad you're not a boy."<p>"Who the hell said I wasn't?" said Ranma with a cheerful smile.<p>"Ha ha," said Akane as she stood up finally and dusted off her<br/>dogi.<p>"Hmm, well, I'm definitely more of a tomboy than you are," said<br/>Ranma with a small wink. "I'm more of a man than you realize."<p>Akane blinked at the statement, and was about to say something.<br/>That was when Kasumi decided to make her entrance though.<p>++++++++++++<p>A short time later, Kasumi had shown Ranma to her room, and then<br/>the bathroom. The ponytailed girl sat down on the stool and scrubbed<br/>herself off for a moment idly.<p>"So? Now what?" said Dan gruffly.<p>"Well, we should go out as a man I guess..." muttered Carrot<br/>almost bitterly.<p>"I guess so, Pop is gonna tell them about it sooner or later,"<br/>agreed Ranma. "I really wish you'd stop doing that when we're a girl<br/>Carrot. You know it bugs the hell out of me!"<p>"Well, I think it's fun. You've got to loosen up some man, you're<br/>too uptight. Nothing compared to Captain Destructo here, but still..."<p>"Those sound like fighting words to me!" snarled Dan.<p>Ranma looked at her arm in terror as a fist began to form.<p>"Now, now, we both know Akane Tendo is going to walk through that<br/>door in the nude any moment now. So let's not get into a fight with<br/>ourselves again. It's obvious that she already thinks we're a little<br/>crazy."<p>"Is she wrong?" deadpanned Ranma.<p>"Probably not," agreed Carrot as he dumped the cold water over her<br/>head.<p>"I say we blow out of here. I've got no interest in this stupid<br/>engagement," snorted Dan.<p>"We'll miss all the fun if we do," commented Carrot lazily as<br/>Ranma shook the water out of her hair and shivered for a moment.<p>"Well, I still say we should have stayed in China!" insisted Dan.<p>"You're just mad you had to leave all that stuff behind,"<br/>commented Carrot lazily.<p>"Stupid Japanese gun laws!" grumbled Dan bitterly.<p>"Hey! We wouldn't have left in such a hurry if not for you!"<br/>snapped Ranma angrily.<p>"They were trying to kill us first!" snapped Dan.<p>"Whatever," said Ranma as he stood up and started to reach for a<br/>towel.<p>At that moment, the door slid open, revealing a nude Akane. "Hi!"<p>"Man, you were right about that peeping stuff," thought Ranma as<br/>he desperately attempted to keep his eyes inside their sockets as he<br/>stared for a moment. Luckily, Akane didn't seem to notice as she sat<br/>down and started to scrub herself off.<p>"Hey, not bad," commented Carrot.<p>"I've seen better," grumbled Dan.<p>"Are you done already?" said Akane with a slightly surprised look<br/>as Ranma started towards the door.<p>"Um, yeah," muttered the redhead as she walked past the girl, and<br/>pulled her towel up around her body.<p>"Let's see what'll happen next," said Dan.<p>"She'll find out, call us a pervert, and then try to brain us with<br/>a table or something," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"She seems nice to me," said Ranma obliviously.<p>"I got a hundred yen that says you're wrong," commented Carrot.<p>"You're on!" snorted Ranma.<p>"Will you two cut that out? How can you make a bet, the yen<br/>belongs to all of us remember?" snapped Dan.<p>"Oh yeah," muttered Ranma.<p>"Spoilsport," said Carrot.<p>"Ranma! Why are you still a girl?" cried Genma as he rushed up to<br/>his son.<p>"Huh? Are you kidding, Pop?" said the redhead irritably.<p>"What do you mean?" snapped Genma.<p>"Akane's in there. You don't want me to scare her half to death do<br/>you?" said the girl as she wandered over to the table and sat down.<p>"Man, I wish I'd thought of that sooner! I'll bet her expression<br/>would have been great!" thought Carrot bitterly.<p>++++++++++++<p>Meanwhile...<p>Sailor Pluto frowned, something was wrong. A force of chaos like<br/>no other had appeared suddenly. She had been unable to pinpoint it,<br/>and it frustrated her to no end. The senshi weren't scheduled to<br/>awaken for some time yet in this universe, not that she realized that<br/>it was different from the others. Beryl shouldn't awaken for many<br/>years either, but this seemed even worse than her.<p>Whatever it was, it was crazy, violent, and chaotic. It had to be<br/>evil, there was nothing good that combined all three of those<br/>qualities. She scowled and glared into the Time Gate, searching for<br/>the source of the disturbance. "Where are you?"<p>She whirled around, turning away from the Time Gate, her scowl<br/>growing with each step she took. A small capsule on the planet earth,<br/>waited patiently for it's awakening. "It looks like I'll have to put<br/>my plans into motion sooner than expected." She sighed, the unexpected<br/>should never happen to her, it just wasn't right. Plus, she was<br/>starting to get a headache, there is nothing Sailor Pluto hates more<br/>than a headache.<p>Soon, Minako would be receiving a visitor, and the events would be<br/>set into motion.<p>She finally did what was needed, and sat down on a nearby table,<br/>pulling a bottle of pills from a desk. She shook it and frowned as she<br/>dumped the last two pills in her palm. "Damn, gotta get this<br/>prescription refilled again."<p>++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>This will grow more twisted as time goes on, the SM tie in was a<br/>last minute addition. Mostly because I realized I've never written one<br/>of those kinds of fics before. This change was also inspired by my<br/>rereading NETTG recently.<p>Updates on this one will be as with The Joy of Fatherhood.<br/>Approximately whenever I feel like it, or about once a month.<p>As per usual on a project like this, continuation depends on<br/>feedback.<p>
