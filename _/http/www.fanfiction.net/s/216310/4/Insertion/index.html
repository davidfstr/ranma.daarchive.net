</div>Insertion<p>Part 4<p>The Great Pigtailed Goddess.<p>++++++++++<p>Akane screamed in frustration as Ranma hopped around her easily.<br/>He had a smug looking grin on his face as he jumped around through the<br/>air, side stepping and skipping past her best strikes.<p>"Come on! Fight me!" she snarled as she spun into a kick. This<br/>time, he grabbed it out of the air almost casually and snorted. "What<br/>do you think you're doing? You said you'd spar with me you jerk! How<br/>can I work out my frustration if you won't hit back?"<p>"Well, when you're good enough to hit me, I'll hit you back," he<br/>replied calmly.<p>Akane stared at him, anger building up inside her for a moment.<br/>"You jerk!"<p>"What? You can't hit me back, so it isn't very fair to just pound<br/>on you," replied the boy as calmly as ever.<p>"Are you saying I'm not good enough to spar with you?"<p>"Have you managed to hit me yet?" retorted the boy calmly.<p>"I'll kill you!" snarled Akane as she charged him.<p>"If you could do that, I'd be more than happy to spar with you,"<br/>said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"That's enough boy!" said Genma as he walked into the dojo. Both<br/>combatants paused and looked at the man for a moment.<p>Ranma pulled his sleeve up and looked at the watch on his wrist<br/>for a moment. "Hey, you're right! It's time for Dragonball Z!" He<br/>walked out past his father and headed straight for the TV.<p>"Um, that's not exactly what I meant boy," muttered Genma. He did<br/>not bar his son's path though.<p>"Mr. Saotome?" said Akane in confusion.<p>Genma sighed, "I feel I owe it to the boy to allow him a half-hour<br/>a day for such things."<p>"You mean you just don't want him to punch you through the wall<br/>again," said Nabiki as she passed by the open door.<p>"Humph! Who do you think taught him how to do that?" snorted Genma<br/>indignantly as he puffed out his chest.<p>"Whatever," grumbled Akane in irritation as she walked past him.<br/>"I'm takin a bath."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Somewhere in the mountains of Japan...(?)<p>"What do you want?" said the figure high above.<p>"Where is Ranma Saotome?" said Ryoga as he looked up at the figure<br/>who was gazing down on him.<p>"What?" said the man high on the top of the wall.<p>"I said, I'm looking for Ranma Saotome," repeated Ryoga.<p>"Huh? No thanks, you see, we already got one of those," said the<br/>man on the wall.<p>"I beg your pardon?" said Ryoga in shock.<p>"Heh. I told him we already got one!" said the man at the top of<br/>the wall to two other men crouched down beside him, out of sight.<p>"Look, I dunno what your talking about, I'm looking for a man<br/>named Ranma Saotome..." said Ryoga irritably from far below them.<p>"Look! A swallow!" said the man who was now speaking in a rather<br/>outrageous French accent. He promptly dropped a coconut down off the<br/>wall. It landed on Ryoga's head and split open.<p>"That hurt you know!" cried Ryoga prissily as he dabbed the milk<br/>off of his face with a handkerchief.<p>"I don't want to talk to you no more! You wiper of other peoples<br/>bottoms! Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of<br/>elderberries!" cried the Frenchman angrily. "Now go away! Or I shall<br/>taunt you a second time!"<p>"What's he on about?" grumbled Ryoga irritably as he glared up at<br/>the annoying man.<p>"Excuse us," said a voice from beside him. Ryoga turned and saw a<br/>group of men dressed up in armor. The one in the lead spoke to him.<br/>"Have you seen a grail around here? You see, we're looking for one..."<p>"Nope, sorry old chap. You wouldn't happen to know of a man called<br/>Ranma Saotome would you?" replied the lost boy as he put up his<br/>umbrella to deflect the various farm animals that were now raining<br/>down on him from above.<p>"No, sorry," replied the man sympathetically.<p>"Excuse me, but...why is it raining farm animals?" said another<br/>one of the knights as he looked up.<p>"I'm not sure. This chap here is quite insane. Going on about how<br/>he's already got one," said Ryoga with a small shrug.<p>"Oh? Really?" said the lead knight as he glanced upwards<br/>nervously. Several chickens fluttered down to the ground around him as<br/>he did so.<p>"Quite," agreed Ryoga.<p>"He's already got a what?" asked one of the other knights.<p>"I'm not sure," said Ryoga. "Look, sorry to bother you. I really<br/>must be going now. I think I've somehow wandered into France again."<p>"Really? Why?" said the lead knight.<p>"Well, that man up there, sounds French," said Ryoga with another<br/>quick glance.<p>"But this is England. What's he doing here?" asked one of the<br/>knights.<p>"I'm not quite sure," said Ryoga honestly. "He's quite rude<br/>though, I don't suppose it's any of my business anyway. I'm Japanese<br/>after all."<p>"Oh, quite right," agreed the knights cheerfully.<p>"Well, I'm off then. Good luck with your grail," said Ryoga<br/>stiffly as he wandered away.<p>"Yes, and good luck with your...Ranma," said the lead knight.<p>"What a nice fellow," commented one of the other knights.<p>"Oh yes, quite nice indeed," agreed another one of them.<p>A dark shadow formed overhead, and the knights looked up, only to<br/>see a huge bovine descending upon them.<p>"Jesus Christ!"<p>+++++++++++++<p>"So?" said Ranma lazily as he sat back at his desk with his arms<br/>folded over his head. Classes were just about to start for the day,<br/>and Ranma wanted to relax a bit before hand. The trio in his head had<br/>worked out a system of sorts. They took shifts, with each subject,<br/>deciding who would pay attention to what was a little difficult, but<br/>it worked out nicely for them in the end. At the moment, their<br/>relaxation was being tampered with, by one irate Akane Tendo.<p>"This is serious! Kuno's written a formal letter of challenge!"<br/>snapped Akane as she handed him the note.<p>"What's so serious about it? I can take that loser," replied Ranma<br/>calmly. "Look, it's only Kuno."<p>"Yes, the boy who was the best fighter at school other than me,<br/>before you came along!" snapped Akane.<p>"Yeah, and you can't even hit me," replied Ranma calmly. "Besides,<br/>it's -before- I came along. He couldn't find his ass with both hands<br/>and a flashlight, much less a clue. That moron doesn't stand a chance<br/>against me."<p>Akane attempted to punch him, but her hand was easily caught and<br/>shoved aside. "Jerk!"<p>"Quit it! You're going to hurt somebody," replied the ponytailed<br/>boy as he deflected a few more cheap shots.<p>Akane growled at him again, but calmed slightly. "I still say<br/>you're taking this too lightly."<p>"Relax would ya?" snorted Ranma. "I got it covered."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome stood glaring at the boy in front of her. They were<br/>both in the center of a large athletic field. The sun was setting in<br/>the distance.<p>"Where is Ranma Saotome?" said Kuno as he glanced around. "Bah!<br/>The coward has not answered my challenge! I knew it would be so! No<br/>doubt he fears my prowess with the sword!"<p>+++++++++<p>"Now what?" snorted Dan lazily. He seemed somewhat amused at the<br/>situation.<p>"How was I supposed to know about the sprinkler system?" said<br/>Carrot. "I'd almost think Kuno told us to meet us here at that time on<br/>purpose. He's not smart enough for that though."<p>"How dare he say that about me!" snapped Ranma as he tried to rush<br/>Kuno and pound him. He was held back by the others. "Lemmy go! Leemy<br/>at 'em!"<p>"Look, he doesn't know that we're Ranma, got it? Leave this to<br/>me," said Carrot with a wry looking grin<p>Ranma paused and frowned. "What are you planning?"<p>"Let's use the grenade!" said Dan excitedly.<p>"No! I think I can talk us out of this, without making us look<br/>bad," said Ranma coolly. "Shut up and let me do all the talking."<p>+++++++<p>"Ranma Saotome isn't afraid of you," said the strange redheaded<br/>girl who stood before Kuno. She paused and noted that a small crowd<br/>from the school had shown up as well.<p>"Who might you be?" said Kuno as he raised his eyebrow slightly.<p>"Ranma Saotome," replied the girl smugly.<p>"It is not you that I seek," said the boy stoically.<p>"Yeah, I know," said the girl with a small shrug. She was grinning<br/>at him and regarding him in almost the same manner of Nabiki. "Look,<br/>Kuno-chan, we gotta talk."<p>"You will address me as Kuno-sempai!" snorted the boy irritably.<p>"Yeah, whatever. Ranma isn't going to fight you," said the girl as<br/>she almost swaggered over to his side and put her hand on his<br/>shoulder. "It's pretty simple really."<p>"What? So it is true! The coward!" snapped Kuno as he clenched his<br/>fist in front of him.<p>"No, Ranma Saotome isn't a coward. He just doesn't like beating up<br/>weaklings, see?" said the girl with her grin growing a little wider.<p>"Weaklings?" roared Kuno as he looked down at her.<p>"Yeah, he beat you so easily earlier today, that there's no point<br/>in fighting you again! See, there's no way you could have improved<br/>enough to fight him in just a couple of days. You'll have to train for<br/>months." said the girl calmly. She was looking at the back of her hand<br/>absently, while leaning off of his shoulder.<p>"Lies! The villain seeks to taint my honor with such vicious<br/>lies!" snapped Kuno.<p>"Bullshit, I was there, he beat the crap out of you," said the<br/>redhead calmly. "Nobody here believes you when you say that he didn't.<br/>We all saw it with our own eyes."<p>"Then it was no doubt an illusion, cast by the foul sorcerer Ranma<br/>Saotome," said Kuno with a slight frown.<p>"Well honey, I hate to say it, but even if he did, it was still<br/>fair. Anything goes in a street fight, including magic," said the girl<br/>as calmly as ever.<p>"Such base trickery," said Kuno in a rather ignorant display.<br/>"Fear not young maiden, I shall lay low this villain on the morrow!"<p>"Look you ass," said Ranma as she pulled the boy into a headlock<br/>and cut off his ranting. "Ranma Saotome is not going to fight you. Got<br/>it? And you're not going to fight him? See?"<p>"I must..." said Kuno through a few gasps.<p>"No," said Ranma as she walked into a tree, with his head. "You're<br/>too weak to fight Ranma again, he might hurt you."<p>"I am not weak!" insisted Kuno. "The Blue Thunder of Furinkan High<br/>is the mightiest warrior that the world has seen for..."<p>The rant was cut off again as Ranma walked him into a statue this<br/>time. "Nope, not buyin it," she insisted cheerfully.<p>"Unhand me woman!" snapped Kuno as she continued to lead him<br/>around the schoolyard.<p>"Make me you weenie," said Ranma as she walked into the building<br/>this time. The group of students were staring in shocked horror, or<br/>laughing so hard they were rolling around on the ground as the tiny<br/>redhead dragged the 'Blue Thunder' around like he was a doll.<p>"Wench! I shall not allow this humiliation to continue!" there was<br/>more to that, but he was cut off by another tree.<p>"Well, I'm just showing you how weak you are. I'm just a cute<br/>little girl, and I'm beating the crap out of you without even trying,"<br/>said Ranma cheerfully. "Ranma Saotome, is much stronger than I am!"<p>"But, did you not say that you were, Ranma Saotome?" muttered Kuno<br/>with a slight slur.<p>"Well, yeah. But that's beside the point. Now, are you going to<br/>fight Ranma again?" The girl sat down, forcing him to the ground<br/>behind him, and began to rub his head rather roughly in one spot.<p>"Never! I shall never submit!" cried Kuno as he struggled on the<br/>ground.<p>"Are you sure?" said Ranma as she continued her assault.<p>"You're noogie attack shall never fell the Blue Thunder!" roared<br/>Kuno. Lightening crashed in the distance somewhere.<p>Ranma paused and looked over her shoulder at the sound, but<br/>shrugged after a moment and continued to rub his head. "If you don't<br/>say something soon, you're hair is going to catch fire. Then you'll be<br/>bald."<p>Kuno's eyes went wide at this announcement. "I cannot become bald!<br/>I will never allow that!"<p>"Well, you'd better promise to leave Ranma alone then," said the<br/>girl with a huge smile on her face as she looked him dead in the eyes.<p>Kuno froze, something in his eyes glazed over as he stared into<br/>the deep pools of blue that seemed to cut into his soul. "I shall..."<br/>he muttered dreamily, not even noticing the smoke that was beginning<br/>to rise off the top of his head.<p>Ranma glared at him, and stopped her rubbing. "You shall what?"<p>"I shall...not challenge Ranma Saotome on the morrow..." he<br/>muttered. "And..."<p>Ranma blinked at this. "And? And what?"<p>"I would date with you!" screamed Kuno as he jerked forward,<br/>sweeping her into his arms. He promptly fell forward, landing with his<br/>head in her lap.<p>"Ouch!" said Ranma cutely as she shoved him off and rubbed at her<br/>backside. "I burnt my fingers, hurt my behind, and cracked a nail!"<br/>she groused as she looked at her hand again for a moment, and then<br/>kicked the fallen Kuno in irritation before standing up.<p>"Perhaps you should consider a diet, my young pigtailed goddess?"<br/>said Kuno from his place on the ground.<p>"You ass! I don't have an ounce of fat on my body!" she screamed<br/>as she turned and stomped on the back of his head repeatedly.<p>Nabiki Tendo, stood nearby with a camera in her hand. The gods had<br/>truly been kind to her today indeed. A barely held back fit of<br/>laughter surfaced slightly, appearing as girlish giggles as she filmed<br/>the entire event, immortalizing it forever.<p>Ranma walked over to her, cheerfully as usual. "Hiya, Nabiki-<br/>chan!"<p>The Tendo girl frowned slightly. Ranma seemed to be more...cute,<br/>when in his female form. "What is it?"<p>"I was just wonderin, what Kuno might do to keep those photos from<br/>being released?" she said cheerfully.<p>Nabiki raised her eyebrow, she had already thought of that of<br/>course. Ranma coming up with that idea, surprised her more than a<br/>little. The girl walked past her and jumped up into the branches of<br/>one of the trees. She came back down with her hands behind her back<br/>and grinned. "What did you just do?"<p>"Just got my camera!" said Ranma as she pulled a small video<br/>recorder from behind her. "I'm betting whatever it is he'll do to keep<br/>those pictures a secret, he'll even more to keep the video hidden!<br/>After all, those pictures don't have all the embarrassing dialogue!<br/>Tee hee!" The redhead skipped away, leaving Nabiki standing in shocked<br/>silence.<p>The Tendo girl stood still as a wind blew by, carrying a few<br/>leaves with it as it rushed across the field. "I don't believe<br/>this..." she said finally.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Ah, Setsuna! Back to see me already?" said Tofu as he looked up<br/>at the woman in front of him from behind his desk.<p>"I need my prescription filled again," said the woman with a<br/>completely drained look about her.<p>"My God! Setsuna! What happened to you?" said the doctor in shock.<p>"My work related headaches have gotten worse, plus I've found a<br/>few disturbing things out about someone from my past. This is not my<br/>day Tofu."<p>"I can see that, normally I wouldn't, but you're a special case I<br/>suppose," said the man as he opened a cabinet behind him and rummaged<br/>around for a moment. "You might want to consider going to a pharmacy<br/>for something a bit stronger. That prescription I wrote you allows for<br/>it."<p>"Thank you doctor," said the woman as she walked out the door.<p>+++++++++++<p>About halfway down the street she paused. A young redhead was<br/>standing in front of her, staring with the biggest, cutest, most<br/>saccharine filled eyes she'd ever seen. That was saying something,<br/>considering how long she'd been around.<p>"Setsuna-samma!" said the girl cutely.<p>"Do I...know you?" stammered the woman as she backed away,<br/>completely powerless under the force of her cuteness.<p>"I...I...I love you!" said the redhead. "I've been admiring you<br/>from afar for so long!" Her face became completely red, and she pulled<br/>her hands up to her face and shook her head from side to side almost<br/>violently. "Oh no! I've said it!"<p>Setsuna's eye twitched, a slight blush crept onto her face as she<br/>looked at the girl in horror. "What?"<p>The girl seemed to calm slightly, and started to play with the<br/>ground with her toes. "I wanted to know if you'd go...on a date with<br/>me...um, if it's not too much trouble..."<p>Setsuna calmed a little more. "Look..."<p>Ranma's eyes went wide again, paralyzing Setsuna with her cuteness<br/>again. "It's because I'm a girl isn't it?"<p>"No, but..." stammered the woman as she attempted to find a way<br/>out of the situation.<p>"Then why!" said the girl as she moved right up to her face,<br/>their lips almost touching. "Tell me!"<p>"I uhh...I...I've got a fiancee!" said Pluto desperately.<p>Ranma's eyebrow creased slightly. "I don't believe you."<p>"No really! His name is Ranma! I was just on my way to see him!"<br/>said the woman as she backed away. "Gotta go! See ya!" She turned and<br/>ran down the street desperately.<p>+++++++++++<p>"!" Ranma was still<br/>screaming.<p>"You can stop now, he's done," said Dan irritably.<p>"Well, phooey," said Carrot as he watched Setsuna vanish down the<br/>street. "I was kinda hopin that would work."<p>"You mean... YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX AS A GIRL?" cried Ranma<br/>desperately.<p>"Only with another girl, relax, Ranma," said Carrot as he waved<br/>off the ranting.<p>"You think that makes it any better!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Well, yeah. Kinda," said Carrot in reply.<p>"I agree with Carrot," said Dan.<p>"You guys are sick!" screamed Ranma.<p>"Calm down. So what if we are? At least we know how to have a good<br/>time," said Carrot calmly. "That, and we now know that Setsuna is<br/>really Ranma's fiancee. Thanks to my undercover work."<p>"Under the covers work is more like it," snorted Dan.<p>"Great," muttered the pigtailed boy dejectedly. "What is that now?<br/>Three?"<p>"Well, four if you count that carryout girl. She might not show up<br/>though, we aren't sure," said Dan.<p>"Look, we've got this all worked out now. I say we stick with<br/>Setsuna! She's the hottest one of all!" said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"She's too old!" snapped Ranma irritably.<p>"She's the Senshi of time, she's whatever age she wants to be,"<br/>said Carrot in retort. "She'll always be that old."<p>"Well, I don't care who we marry. I just want to use my grenade<br/>soon," said Dan.<p>"What's wrong with Ak...um...some other girl?" said Ranma.<p>"On second thought, I agree with Carrot," said Dan. "We aren't<br/>marrying any violent tomboys."<p>"Well, that rules out most of Ranma's other fiancee's. I'm not<br/>becoming an Amazon male either, so that leaves us with Setsuna!" said<br/>Carrot happily. "Now, how to ask her out...without dying?"<p>+++++++++++<p>"Um, excuse me," said the young blonde woman as she looked down at<br/>the man in front of her. She had come to stop an attempted mugging,<br/>but found herself witnessing a rather impressive display of skill<br/>instead. "Um..Hi! I'm Sailor V...do you need any help?"<p>There were several men sprawled out across the ground unconscious,<br/>with him standing in the middle with an umbrella over his shoulder. On<br/>his head was a bolo hat, and he was dressed in a dark colored suit,<br/>with a long trench coat. The only unusual thing, was the yellow and<br/>black handkerchief that poked out of his jacket pocket. "Ah! Good day<br/>young lady! Oh my!" He paused and looked at her.<p>Venus smiled, no doubt she was smitten by her beauty. Plus, he<br/>didn't look that much older! Maybe she could...<p>"You really should dress warmer than that! You'll catch a dreadful<br/>cold!" exclaimed the boy. "By the look of you, I'd say you attend a<br/>private school near here. Tell me, could you point me in the direction<br/>of Furinkan High? I'm looking for a fellow named Ranma Saotome. I've<br/>gotten quite lost you see."<p>Venus jumped down, blinking in surprise. "Well, I haven't been<br/>around here long...wait a minute! You think this is a school uniform?"<p>"Isn't it? I'll admit it is rather short..." said Ryoga as he<br/>looked her over for a moment.<p>"I'm the champion of justice! Sailor V!" snapped the girl<br/>irritably.<p>"Oh, quite nice, quite nice indeed," said Ryoga as he unfolded his<br/>map again.<p>Venus rolled her eyes and looked at the map. "Um, this is a road<br/>map of Idaho."<p>"Really?" said Ryoga in surprise. "That would explain why I passed<br/>Boise a few hours ago! I had no idea Idaho was so close to Japan!"<p>Venus glanced up at him. His face was completely serious. "Right.<br/>Look, I'll be going now. Sorry I couldn't help you."<p>"Quite all right! Quite all right indeed!" said Ryoga with a good-<br/>natured chuckle as he waved her off. After she was gone, he paused and<br/>pulled the handkerchief from his pocket, dabbing it gently along the<br/>bottom of his nose. "Such an outfit! She'll catch cold if she isn't<br/>more careful," he muttered as he wandered away, and tilted his head<br/>back while pressing the cloth against his nostrils.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Hey, where are we?" said Carrot as he looked around. He paused as<br/>he found he could see himself, if only a little transparent. He was<br/>dressed much the same as the man across from him. "Who?"<p>"Carrot?" said the man with a surprised look on his face.<p>"Dan?" said Carrot as he recognized his voice.<p>"Where's Ranma? What's going on?" said Dan.<p>"Ranma's behind you," said Carrot as he nodded over to the<br/>ponytailed boy.<p>Ranma was standing, and simply staring off into space. "So, you<br/>two are the voices inside my head?"<p>"Um, yeah. What's going on?" said Carrot. He noticed that only<br/>himself and Dan were transparent.<p>"Die!" screamed Ranma as he attacked them. The ponytailed boy<br/>blinked as he passed through them and landed on his face.<p>"I've been wanting to do this for a long time!" snarled Dan as he<br/>sprung at Carrot, only to have his fist pass through him as well.<p>"I think I get it, we're dreaming," said Carrot with a chuckle as<br/>he watched the two idiots continue to try and fight each other, and<br/>him.<p>The pair paused and glanced around. "What makes you think that?"<br/>said Dan in a deadpan voice.<p>"I dunno, only the fact that we're looking at the Silver Millenium<br/>right now."<p>The trio turned and looked around, only to find themselves<br/>surrounded by a palace of some kind. Carrot smirked and crossed his<br/>arms over his chest. "Pay attention Ranma, you're about to remember<br/>some of your past life."<p>"Huh?" stammered the ponytailed boy in shock.<p>A figure walked down the hallway with a huge frown on his face. He<br/>had long red hair and an extremely muscular body, his chest bare, save<br/>a single red sash that was draped over one of his shoulders. A<br/>broadsword hung from his hip as well, and he was trailed by a long<br/>flowing dark green cape. His features revealed a familiar face to all<br/>present.<p>"Hey!" exclaimed Ranma in shock. "Why the heck am I wearin a<br/>skirt?"<p>"I've come ta see the Queen, as requested by her majesty," said<br/>the past Ranma with a thick accent. "Tell her the Wild Pony of the<br/>Highlands has come, ta meet his future bride. Tell her Genaku McTome<br/>is here."<p>Dan and Carrot were rolling on the ground with laughter.<p>"Y-yessir!" said the guard who was standing by the door with a<br/>terror stricken face. He stumbled across his own feet as he rushed in<br/>to inform the queen.<p>++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Now, there's no way in hell you were expecting that!<br/>BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!<p>Next time: Dream a little dream!<p>
