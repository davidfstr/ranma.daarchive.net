</div>Insertion<p>Part 19<p>Flames of Defeat!<p>+++++++++++++<p>Mousse strolled into the Cat Cafe and stopped cold in the doorway.<p>Shampoo and Cologne both paused and looked at him as he posed and<br/>curled his lip. "Hey big momma, The King, has returned."<p>Cologne was frozen in shock as the boy walked up to an equally<br/>surprised Shampoo. "Hey, baby. Wanna go somewhere and get to know each<br/>other?" He grabbed her shoulder as he said this.<p>"Mousse?" said the girl dumbly.<p>The boy was looking at his reflection in a painting and combing<br/>his hair. "Man I'm pretty. So how about it babe?"<p>Cologne snapped to life suddenly. She charged forward and poked<br/>Mousse with her staff. "Hateful being! What do you think you're<br/>doing?"<p>The boy stood up and ran a comb through his hair again. "Hey!<br/>Watch the hair!"<p>"Mousse, I'll ask you once more...what are you doing?" said the<br/>woman carefully.<p>"I'm gonna defeat Ranma Saotome, and win the heart of this pretty<br/>lady!" said Mousse. He then posed again and pointed at her. "Hoo ha!"<p>"Shampoo, turn away from Mousse," said Cologne with a heavy sigh.<p>The girl did so, and Mousse arched his eyebrow. "Huh?"<p>Cologne turned her back on him as well. "You have learned<br/>forbidden techniques Mousse. I hear by cast you out of the village<br/>forever."<p>"Duh?" muttered Mousse as his jaw dropped.<p>"You must leave now," said the old woman firmly.<p>"But...I...I'll forget about the stupid techniques!" cried the boy<br/>in desperation. "You can't do this to me! Please! I'll never wear big<br/>jewelry or sequence again!"<p>"It is too late Mousse, the fact that you hold any knowledge at<br/>all of these techniques is enough. The King is the eternal enemy of<br/>our tribe. The chaos he wrought upon us when he came to China is still<br/>remembered as out darkest hour."<p>"The King?" stammered Mousse in horror.<p>"Yes, he used his charms to overpower the entire village. Anyone<br/>under the age of twenty was helpless against him. For a male to hold<br/>that much power over a woman, it is too dangerous. You are now cast<br/>out forever Mousse, never lay eyes on Shampoo again."<p>"But...I...NOOOOOOOO!" cried the boy as he rushed out the door<br/>and into the street clutching his head.<p>"Aiya! Poor Mousse," said Shampoo as she turned back around.<p>"Perhaps it is for the best child. He is dead to us now, you are<br/>to treat him as nothing more than a ghost from this day forward."<p>The young amazon nodded her head and started to go back to her<br/>work again. She was moving a little slower now though, and seemed<br/>preoccupied.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome sat at the table in the Tendo home. That in itself<br/>wasn't unusual, the fact that Nabiki was sitting next to him, watching<br/>him carefully was.<p>He paused and glanced at her for a moment. "What?"<p>"Nothing," she said with a small frown on her face.<p>"You've been acting weird," he muttered.<p>"So have you," she replied calmly. "Since the day you came here."<p>"So what? I'm an unusual guy," he replied with a small shrug as he<br/>stood up and walked up to his room and left her there.<p>"A little to unusual," she muttered as she watched him go.<p>+++++++++++<p>"What?" Pluto looked up at Serenity and scowled.<p>"I said, you're neglecting your wifely duties," said the Queen<br/>with a serious looking frown.<p>"I haven't! I've appeared with that oaf at every state dinner<br/>and..." she started as she pointed at the man.<p>He was calmly eating a large leg of meat at a nearby table and<br/>ignoring the situation.<p>"But you haven't produced any children," said the Queen with a<br/>sour frown. "You need an heir."<p>"I'm immortal! What would I need with..." started the woman.<p>"If something should happen to you, then we will need a<br/>replacement," said Serenity with a cool smirk.<p>"You! You put her up to this didn't you?" snarled Pluto as she<br/>turned towards Genaku.<p>"What makes ya think I desire a child?" he replied with a small<br/>shrug. "I've no use for this union. My opinion isn't relevant though."<p>"He is correct, this is a matter of diplomacy as much as anything<br/>else," said Serenity calmly. "Pluto will need an ambassador one day,<br/>those scientist you've been sending aren't cutting it."<p>"But...how can I...I won't let that thing touch me!" snarled Pluto<br/>as she pointed towards Genaku again.<p>The man blinked and snorted in reply. He then continued to eat.<p>"That is a part of your duty as a wife," insisted Serenity.<p>Pluto stared at Genaku in horror. He was still eating like the<br/>barbarian he was. He was a far cry from attractive, brutish, large,<br/>and covered in scars from his many battles. He was far from fat, but<br/>bulky to ridiculous levels, to say nothing of his wild red hair and<br/>beard. As far as Pluto was concerned, he was as close to a cave man as<br/>you could get without actually being one.<p>As if to prove the point, the man gave a loud belch and resumed<br/>his eating, pausing a moment later to lift half his rear up and let<br/>out another, more repulsive emission.<p>Pluto felt her entire face turn red and a sick look crossed her<br/>face. "You must be joking."<p>"I am not. There is nothing wrong with Genaku, the Senshi of<br/>Saturn seems to like him," replied Serenity.<p>"So let her have him! I will not, and cannot be the mother of his<br/>child. Even if you threaten me with death!"<p>Serenity sighed and rested her head in her palm. This wasn't going<br/>as well as she had hoped. She had thought that they were secretly<br/>involved, and just couldn't produce. In fact, she expected embarrassed<br/>sputtering and avoidance of the topic from the both of them.<p>Genaku stood up from the table and wiped his mouth off with his<br/>arm before letting loose another loud belch. "In any case, 'tis a moot<br/>point," he said with a small chuckle.<p>"What do you mean?" said Serenity coolly.<p>"'Tis simple your highness. Like all the others involved with the<br/>game, I am sterile. No heir will ever be produced from me loins."<p>Serenity blinked and stared at him. "You never told me that."<p>"You did na ask," he replied with a small shrug. "I must give you<br/>mah leave. Inspections and all that."<p>Serenity merely sat on her throne and watched him go. Pluto looked<br/>up at her and held her breath. Her face began to turn blue as she<br/>fumed angrily. "That...that...BASTARD!"<p>++++++++++++<p>"Interesting," said Carrot as they seemed to jerk back to reality<br/>suddenly.<p>"Whoa. Pluto was pissed," commented Ranma.<p>"What a horrible man!" said Pissant.<p>"We seemed to be enjoying that though," commented Dan.<p>"In any case, this goes a long way towards explaining why Pluto<br/>hates us," agreed Carrot.<p>"Really? Doesn't seem any worse than anything else Ranma did to<br/>her," pointed out Dan.<p>"Hey! It wasn't me!" snapped the pigtailed boy in retort.<p>"Yeah, it was," said Carrot calmly.<p>"Come on, let's go to the office. Nabiki is starting to creep me<br/>out," said Dan as he looked over and saw the girl watching their room<br/>with a pair of binoculars from the bushes.<p>"Wonder what she's on about?" muttered Carrot.<p>"Maybe she likes us?" said Pissant cheerfully.<p>"Well, there was the other night, but she doesn't seem to be<br/>acting like she does," commented Carrot with a small frown.<p>"She seems suspicious of something," pointed out Dan.<p>"About what though? There's a lot of things she may have stumbled<br/>onto," pointed out Carrot.<p>"We'll deal with it when it comes up," said Dan with a small sigh.<br/>He closed the curtain in their room and smirked at her before he did<br/>so.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Damn, that bastard," grumbled Nabiki as she stood up from her<br/>hiding spot and lowered the binoculars. The boy had looked directly at<br/>her as he shut the curtains. "I know he's up to something, but what?"<p>+++++++++++<p>"Hey Akane," said Ranma as he strolled by her office and noticed<br/>her leaning back in her chair with a book in her hands. "What's up?"<p>"Three more sightings of that Okii Atama character," she said<br/>calmly.<p>Ranma nodded, manage to find him again.<p>"We stopped trying, he's too fast. Usually gone by the time we get<br/>there too," replied the girl with a small shrug.<p>"Right, any reports in lately?" he picked up one of the tabloid<br/>newspapers on her desk and frowned. "Fire that heals the soul?"<p>"You read those things?" she muttered in disgust.<p>"Best investigative reporting on the planet," replied the boy<br/>calmly. "We should look into this. Seems some sort of spiritual healer<br/>is healing injuries with magical power."<p>"What's wrong with that?" said the girl with a small frown.<p>"Once healed, the cured are reported as being weak for several<br/>days. As if drained by something."<p>"You saw that too did you?" commented Jadeite as he walked into<br/>the room.<p>"Yeah. Actually helping people, while stealing their energy. A<br/>brilliant way to disguise an energy gathering operation."<p>"Kinda wish I'd thought of it," muttered the general with a small<br/>frown.<p>"Not something your average youma would think of either," said<br/>Ranma with a small frown.<p>"You're right about that," said Jadeite with a small frown. "We've<br/>been replaced it seems."<p>"By who, or what?" said Ranma as he narrowed his eyes.<p>"That guy apparently," said Jadeite as he pointed at a photograph<br/>of a young man in his twenties. He was thin and gangly, with a shock<br/>of red hair. The man was dressed in a suit and tie, and was putting<br/>his hand on the forehead of an unfortunate man in a wheelchair. This<br/>was taking place in front of a small crowd of worshipers.<p>"This is an American practice, faith healers," said Ranma.<p>"Seems harmless," said Akane as she glanced up at the two.<p>"Come on Akane," said Ranma as he motioned for her to follow.<p>"Huh? Where are we going?" muttered the girl in confusion as she<br/>went after him.<p>"Juban," replied the boy with a smirk on his face. "I think I need<br/>to have my soul healed."<p>Nephrite met them in the hallway and held out a belt buckle to<br/>Ranma. "Here, it's fixed. It might be good for one or two attacks from<br/>Pluto, but not more than that. The other Senshi aren't using magic<br/>strong enough to get through though."<p>"That's good to know," replied the boy with a small nod.<p>++++++++++++<p>"And with only a small donation, you too can help us spread the<br/>word of Jesus across the entire world! His healing power fills my<br/>soul, and I feel revived!"<p>"Praise Jesus!" cried a few members of the large crowd inside the<br/>auditorium. Several worshipers passed out in fevers of devotion, or so<br/>they thought.<p>The young reverend smirked to himself as he saw the crystal flame<br/>on top of the large ornamented cross that hung from the wall behind<br/>him suddenly flare with more energy. It was subtle, and looked like<br/>nothing more than a fancy light bulb.<p>"Tonight, we will honor our lord and savior once again! With your<br/>help, we can truly serve him as his loyal servants!" He strolled<br/>across the stage dramatically waving his arms about.<p>The worshipers raised their hands into the air and broke into song<br/>suddenly as the organ player nearby began to play.<p>"I want you to touch the screen if you're watching at home. Feel<br/>that weakening in your knees? That's the power of the lord descending<br/>upon you! He strengthens your souls! Can you feel it!" He raised his<br/>hand and pointed it out while bowing his head and closing his eyes.<p>In the back of the room, Ranma Saotome smirked to himself. "Very<br/>clever."<p>"Wow, he's good," commented Akane in awe.<p>"Very good," agreed Ranma. "We've got to stop him."<p>"What? But..." Akane looked around, it was a far cry from the<br/>traditional religions of Japan, but didn't seem to be hurting anyone.<br/>In fact, earlier he had actually healed three people. The injuries<br/>were genuine too, this was more than a mere scam.<p>"He's a Youma," said Ranma calmly.<p>"Don't be stupid! He's helped those people. You saw them," said<br/>the girl with a scowl on her face.<p>"A perfect cover, the energy to do that is nothing compared to the<br/>energy he's gathered in that crystal up there," said the boy as he<br/>nodded towards the cross.<p>"So, we attack them?" said Akane as she noticed the crystal.<p>"On national television? With a crowd full of people? Don't be<br/>silly. We should wait until the show is over," said the boy as he<br/>moved towards the door.<p>+++++++++++<p>Outside the pair waited in a small cafe near to the large<br/>auditorium. Ranma had a newspaper in his hands and was glaring at one<br/>story in particular.<p>"Is something wrong?" asked Akane.<p>"Yes," replied the boy as he lay the pages down on the table.<p>"Mysterious disappearances in Juban! Police baffled! Six young<br/>girls have vanished!"<p>"You don't think that has anything to do with..." gasped Akane.<p>"Most likely," confirmed the boy with a small frown.<p>++++++++++<p>"Reverend, my mother is very sick..." said the young girl who<br/>stood in front of a small dressing room. "I was hoping you could<br/>maybe..." She was pretty, somewhere between sixteen and seventeen<br/>years old, with long green hair. Her dress was modest, but it was<br/>clear it hid a very nice figure.<p>"What is it child?" said the young man as he turned away from his<br/>dresser and looked at her for a moment with a strange smile on his<br/>face. "Tell me your name."<p>"Miaka..." said the girl shyly. A blush crossed her face as the<br/>man looked at her gently and grabbed her shoulder. He pulled her<br/>inside the room and closed the door.<p>"Shameful," muttered one of the women who worked on the spectacle.<p>"He has the power of the lord in him," said another of the women.<p>"Still. I don't understand how he could fall to such base<br/>temptation," said the woman as she turned away from the scene.<p>"He's just a man, everyone has a weakness," replied the other<br/>woman as she followed her companion.<p>+++++++++<p>Inside the dressing room the man sat across from the girl and<br/>watched her hungrily. "Tell me child. What is it you want?"<p>"My mother, she's sick. She's been in the hospital, and can't come<br/>here. She watches your show, and I've seen you heal people. Could<br/>you..." The girl was very nervous, but the man's gentle tone seemed to<br/>calm her.<p>"Of course I could my child," said the man as he brushed her face.<br/>"However, there is a price to pay."<p>"What?" she muttered as she looked up at him fearfully.<p>"The power inside me, it hungers for things. Certain beastly<br/>desires, it is required for my healing touch to continue. If you would<br/>help me feed this desire, I could help your mother." He smiled at her<br/>for a moment, moving her hair out of her face.<p>She jumped up in shock and stepped away from him. "But...you are a<br/>man of the lord! I couldn't..."<p>"I am a servant of the one who will one day rule this world," said<br/>the man with a small nod. "However, I require such things in order to<br/>continue my service to the almighty."<p>The girl looked up at him fearfully and nodded her head. He turned<br/>his back on her and she slowly started to remove her shirt, pulling it<br/>off of her shoulder slowly. She swallowed and closed her eyes, tears<br/>forming there. "Forgive me mother..."<p>The red-haired man merely stared forward at the wall, his grin no<br/>longer human. It was wide, and almost split his face in half. Sharp<br/>teeth lined his jaws and he flicked off the light in the room before<br/>turning around to face the girl again. "Don't worry. It only hurts for<br/>a moment."<p>"What?" said the fear filled voice.<p>Outside the dressing room, no one heard the screams, the building<br/>now vacated completely.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"We're going in," said Ranma calmly as he stood in front of the<br/>doors.<p>"All right," muttered Akane nervously as she stood behind him.<p>+++++++++<p>The building was completely silent as they strolled through the<br/>rows of seats. Not a single soul was left inside the entire building.<p>"Stay close," said Ranma calmly as he strolled up onto the stage<br/>and glanced around. It was dark, but a few windows still let in light<br/>from outside.<p>"Right," said Akane firmly. The nervous edge was gone from her<br/>voice now. She glanced around and looked up at the crystal. "It's not<br/>glowing anymore."<p>"He's probably got the energy with him, if he's even still here.<br/>He may have returned to the Negaverse to deliver it." He strolled<br/>behind one of the curtains and into a hallway that led into the<br/>backstage area of the building.<p>"What's this?" said Akane as she looked at a few rows of doors.<p>"Dressing rooms," replied the boy with a small frown.<p>"Should we check them out?" said Akane as she reached for one of<br/>the door handles.<p>"Yup," said Ranma as he turned towards one of them and reared his<br/>leg back. He paused when something caught his attention. "What is<br/>that?"<p>"Huh?" said Akane as she looked at where he was staring.<p>"A puddle?" she walked over and knelt down beside it. "This looks<br/>like..." Her eyes grew wide as she staggered back in horror.<p>"Blood," said Ranma as he narrowed his eyes and turned towards the<br/>door it was coming from.<p>Akane drew the tiny weapon from her coat and pointed it at the<br/>door. Ranma glanced at her and nodded before kicking it in.<p>A figure slowly stood up and turned to face them. "The service is<br/>over."<p>"We aren't here to pray," replied Ranma calmly. "We're here to put<br/>a stop to this operation youma."<p>"Oh? Well, if it isn't the new Genaku! I've so wanted to meet<br/>you," said the shadowy figure as he stepped towards the door and<br/>paused as he noticed the weapons that were trained on him.<p>"Well, I'm glad to give you the pleasure. Come on out and we'll<br/>talk," said Ranma with a slight tensing in his voice.<p>The light came on inside the room and a blood-soaked man with red<br/>hair stood grinning at them evilly. The remains of a young girl were<br/>sprawled out across the ground, her chest was open and most of her<br/>innards were gone.<p>Akane stepped back and lowered her weapon in shocked horror. She<br/>wanted to scream, but the panic was so much that she couldn't.<p>The man had tears in his eyes as he looked at them sadly. "I have<br/>sinned!"<p>"Shit!" barked Ranma as he shot a single blast into the thing's<br/>chest and jumped away. He grabbed Akane by her arm and pulled her down<br/>the hall towards the auditorium.<p>"Ouch," muttered the man as he stood up and noticed the large hole<br/>in the front of his suit. His chest was unharmed though and he<br/>chuckled as he stood up.<p>Ranma spun around to face the Youma once he reached the stage, a<br/>dark scowl on his face as he prepared to fight. "Akane, stay back for<br/>now. If you get a clear shot, take it, but don't get between us no<br/>matter what happens."<p>"Right," said the girl as she moved into the seating area and took<br/>cover.<p>The red-haired youma walked out calmly and glared at Ranma for a<br/>moment. "Well, now what?"<p>"Who are you? I don't recognize you," said the boy coldly.<p>"I am called Takibi," said the youma. "You are Genaku McTome are<br/>you not?"<p>"I was," said Ranma with a smirk forming on his face. "I go by<br/>Ranma these days."<p>"Well, Ranma. Are you prepared to die?" said the thing as it<br/>narrowed its eyes at him.<p>"Not today," replied the boy as a glow began to form around his<br/>body.<p>The Youma lord merely smirked, his entire body burst into flames.<br/>"Come then, let's see if you can escape my power."<p>Ranma charged forward faster than Akane could see. He appeared<br/>behind the thing and punched it in the center of its back. Or it<br/>appeared that way, Ranma's fist passed right through the thing and he<br/>stopped with a shocked look on his face.<p>"What the hell?"<p>"Got ya," replied the Youma from behind him. Ranma was kicked<br/>away, the flames dissipating as they came into contact with his<br/>protective shield.<p>Ranma staggered to his feet and wavered for a moment.<br/>"He's...strong..."<p>Akane jumped up from behind her seat and leveled her weapon at the<br/>thing. Without bothering to speak, she screamed and fired the tiny<br/>weapon.<p>The Youma was taken by surprise and flew into the air, the<br/>remainder of his shirt flew apart as he sailed through the back wall<br/>of the auditorium.<p>Unfortunately, Akane was also lifted off of her feet and thrown<br/>back into the seats. She landed roughly, and passed out as her head<br/>hit the arm of one of the chairs.<p>Ranma rushed forward to press the momentary advantage, blasting<br/>into the thing as it staggered out of the hole in the wall and<br/>clutched its forehead. "HAAA!"<p>The youma was forced back, its arms becoming a blur as it blocked<br/>every strike with relative ease. "You'll have to do better than that.<br/>I have the power of the almighty on my side."<p>"Right, the almighty Metallia?" commented Ranma with a dark frown.<p>"You are a sharp one," replied the youma coolly.<p>"Let's see your almighty bitch deal with this! Kaio Ken special!<br/>Katsutenshin Amaguriken!"<p>The youma gasped in shock as visible shockwaves became apparent in<br/>the air around the boy's hands. He barely had time to notice it as his<br/>entire body exploded with pain suddenly. He was thrown into a wall<br/>again and it crumbled around him.<p>Ranma fell to his knees breathing roughly. His knuckles were<br/>bleeding and his hands were badly bruised. "Take...that..." he gasped.<p>"Raaaahhhhh!" cried the Youma as he stood up and wiped his chin.<br/>"That really hurt!" he snarled angrily.<p>"It was supposed to hurt," replied Ranma as he narrowed his eyes<br/>at the thing. He knew he was in trouble, there was no way he could<br/>pull off that attack again. The thing wasn't all that badly damaged<br/>either, other than a few bruises and a busted lip, it seemed fine. "No<br/>fair! When I come up with a new attack, you're supposed to be<br/>defeated!"<p>The youma lord stood up, his hair billowing about as the flames<br/>surrounding his body suddenly flared up. "You'll die for that!"<p>"No!" gasped Ranma as a ball of fire formed in the thing's palms.<br/>He started to move away, but it was to fast. He screamed in agony as<br/>his shield gave out and his entire body was engulfed in flames. He<br/>jumped off the edge of the stage and rolled around on the ground for a<br/>moment.<p>"Impressive, no one has ever survived that attack before," said<br/>the Youma Lord as he looked down and saw that Ranma was relatively<br/>unharmed. He looked a little scorched, but even his suit was still<br/>mostly intact.<p>Ranma opened his eyes, an angry scowl on his face as he looked up<br/>at the youma. "Hello?" he muttered out loud. "Damn, everyone's out but<br/>me..."<p>"Who are you talking too?" asked the youma with a slight smirk on<br/>his face.<p>"No one, don't worry about it. We're going to do this my way now,"<br/>replied the boy as he looked up at the youma and smirked. He reached<br/>behind his back and pulled out two sleek looking firearms.<p>The youma blinked and cocked his head. "You should know those<br/>things can't kill me."<p>"Killing you isn't the plan. I'm gonna beat the shit out of you<br/>with em," replied Ranma as he leveled one of the weapons on the thing<br/>and shot it in the chest. The youma was lifted off his feet and sent<br/>sprawling across the ground.<p>"Damn you!" it cried as it started to get up.<p>Ranma jumped back onto the stage and fired another shot, forcing<br/>the thing to lie on its back again.<p>"What are you trying to do?" snarled the thing as it tried to get<br/>up again.<p>Ranma smirked, and fired a shot into the thing's crotch.<p>It sat upright with its eyes growing wide suddenly.<p>"Bye bye," said the boy as he fired a shot at point blank rage in<br/>its face. The youma was sent sliding across the stage and slammed into<br/>a wall with its head. The stone cracked, but held this time. Ranma<br/>walked up calmly as the thing groaned and rolled over onto its back.<p>"You realize I'm going to destroy you for this," snarled the<br/>thing.<p>Ranma said nothing, but started to fire off shots one after<br/>another into the thing as it lay on the ground. It screamed in pain<br/>with each blast, but they still did nothing more than pound a few<br/>bruises into place.<p>Finally Ranma stopped firing and looked down at the thing for a<br/>moment.<p>"Out of ammo?" snarled the thing as it started to rise.<p>"No. This is pointless though, I'm not going to beat you today. I<br/>can stop your little operation though," said the boy with a small<br/>shrug as he replaced his weapons.<p>"How are you going to do that?" snapped the red-haired youma as it<br/>finally stood up and leaned against the wall.<p>"I already have," replied the boy as he jumped off the stage and<br/>started running up the aisle. He paused long enough to pick up Akane's<br/>unconscious form, and then bolted for the doors at a full sprint.<p>"What?" muttered the youma as he staggered towards them. His head<br/>was clouded though and he fumbled to his knees. When he bent forward<br/>to stand up again, his eyes caught a small silver object on the<br/>ground. "What? That's a..." Then everything went red.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Ranma?" muttered Akane as she sat up and saw the boy staring at a<br/>large vacant lot with what looked like tears in his eyes.<p>"That was so cool," muttered Ranma as he clenched his fist in<br/>front of his face.<p>"Huh?" muttered the girl as she looked around. She was sitting on<br/>a park bench just outside of the auditorium. Or rather, where the<br/>auditorium used to be.<p>"It's gone!" gasped the girl as her eyes went wide.<p>"Shhh! Anti matter explosion," replied the boy as he put his<br/>finger over her lips. "Vaporizes any matter it comes in contact with.<br/>No debris, no mess, and easily contained."<p>"How are we going to explain this?" stammered Akane as she looked<br/>up at the vacant lot again.<p>"Hey! What happened to that building?" said Ranma as he walked<br/>over to a nearby yakitori vendor.<p>"Huh? Oh, that. It was demolished last week," replied the man with<br/>a small shrug. "Musta been old or something."<p>Ranma turned to face her and pulled his neuralizer out of his<br/>front pocket a little to show it to her.<p>"Oh," she muttered flatly. "Can we go home now?"<p>"Not much else we can do here," replied the boy with a small<br/>shrug.<p>Akane was strangely silent as they walked towards someplace where<br/>they could teleport away without being seen. "What the hell have I<br/>gotten myself into?" She pulled the Noisy Cricket out of her pocket<br/>and looked at it for a moment. "Can I really handle this?"<p>Ranma put on his shades as they rounded the corner and moved into<br/>an alleyway. He seemed to be having the time of his life. "Ready?"<p>"I think I am," she said with a small nod.<p>Ranma blinked, not realizing that she was answering a completely<br/>different question.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Mousse meets Okii Atama, and gets himself a job?
