</div>Insertion<p>Part 68<p>Vahn's Revenge Part one.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Usagi Hibiki sat in front of her mother with a<br/>grin on her face as she ate breakfast. The woman<br/>was frowning at her and looking thoughtful. The<br/>morning lesson had gone off without a hitch,<br/>Yusaku included. It had been that way for several<br/>days now. Though no one spoke of the incident that<br/>had occurred two weeks before.<p>"What are you so happy about?" grumbled the<br/>woman irritably.<p>"Nothing," said the girl cheerfully.<p>"Right," muttered Yohiko as she turned her<br/>head away.<p>Inside the woman's mind, the group was<br/>speculating what had occurred.<p>"You know, she's been real happy for the past<br/>week or so," commented Dan.<p>"She's probably overjoyed that I'm getting<br/>laid," grumbled Xianfu.<p>"Yeah, you don't seem to share the mood," said<br/>Carrot.<p>"Maybe if I was enjoying it I might," said the<br/>woman in retort.<p>"Yeah, but you keep coming back," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully.<p>"You're convenient. Four hours a day isn't<br/>enough to find a boyfriend and start a<br/>relationship on my own."<p>"Yusaku would be happy to oblige," commented<br/>Dan.<p>"You stay out of this!" snapped Xianfu.<p>"Whatever," muttered Ranma angrily.<p>Pissant kept silent, not wanting to anger his<br/>fellow 'roommates' unnecessarily.<p>"I think it's just that I'm a better lay,"<br/>commented Carrot indifferently.<p>"Yeah, that does help," said Xianfu with the<br/>same indifference.<p>"Well, at any rate, she's acting like you<br/>should be. I wonder who the lucky guy is?" said<br/>Dan.<p>"Don't even joke about that!" snapped Xianfu<br/>in shock.<p>"It's too easy," said Dan with an amused<br/>chuckle.<p>Ranma arched their eyebrows slightly as they<br/>turned to look at their daughter again. "You know,<br/>that kinda makes sense."<p>"What?" muttered Xianfu in horror. "No! She<br/>wouldn't?"<p>"Hey, don't forget who her mother is. We<br/>modeled her after the real one," commented Carrot<br/>with a frown on their face.<p>"..."<p>"It's time to go to work," said Pissant hoping<br/>to end the discussion.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Miss Hibiki!" said a familiar voice as Yohiko<br/>entered the school grounds. The woman winced as<br/>she turned to see a very cheerful Akane Tendo<br/>rushing up to them.<p>"Good morning, Akane," she said with a false<br/>cheerfulness on her face.<p>"I'm glad to see you're well," said the girl<br/>as she bowed to her.<p>"Well, anyone can catch a little flu now and<br/>then," said the woman as she returned the<br/>formality with a much lighter bow.<p>"Yes, it was terrible while you were gone,"<br/>said the girl sourly. "That substitute just wasn't<br/>the same."<p>"You're bordering on brown nosing, Akane,"<br/>replied the woman with a playful smirk.<p>The girl blushed and laughed slightly at the<br/>jab. "Sorry."<p>"Don't worry about it," replied Yohiko as she<br/>strolled towards the building. "Aren't you here a<br/>little early today?"<p>"Yes, I'm...not going to class today," replied<br/>the girl with a blush on her face. "I'm<br/>transferring out of Furinkan. I'll miss this<br/>place, and I'll really miss you. I hate to leave,<br/>but..."<p>Yohiko blinked dumbly. "Pardon?"<p>"I'm moving in with my fiancee," said the girl<br/>a little sadly. "My father doesn't know yet."<p>"Fiancee?" said the woman as her face suddenly<br/>became serious. "I thought that..."<p>"No, not him," said the girl with a sudden<br/>pain flashing on her face. "You know him, it's<br/>Shinnosuke. We're old friends from when I was very<br/>young. We've been keeping in contact through<br/>letters, and..."<p>The older woman blinked and smiled at her.<br/>"So, he asked you to marry him?"<p>"Yes, a month ago. I just recently accepted,"<br/>said the girl as she turned away from her.<p>Yohiko smirked and laughed gently. "I'm<br/>surprised he remembered."<p>"Really?" said the girl as her face fell.<p>"Well, I suppose I shouldn't be, I did tattoo<br/>it on the back of his hand after all," she<br/>amended.<p>Akane smiled. "Yes, thank you."<p>"Well, when will you be leaving?"<p>"I'm going to pack now," replied the girl.<p>"Well, good luck to you then," said the woman.<p>"Miss Yohiko?" asked Akane as she turned to<br/>face the woman.<p>"Yes Akane?"<p>"You never did tell me why you were there. At<br/>Ryuugenzawa I mean."<p>The older woman's face fell and she blinked.<br/>"Oh that." She scratched the back of her head and<br/>laughed nervously. "I'm afraid it's quite simple.<br/>I saw you leaving and I was bored, so I followed<br/>you."<p>Akane blinked. "Huh?"<p>"There really isn't much to do outside of this<br/>town you know," said the woman with a shrug.<p>"You followed me all the way there?" gasped<br/>the girl as she stared at her. "That's like..."<p>"Yes, well...I didn't come across anything<br/>more interesting while I was after you," she said<br/>as she chuckled.<p>"Oh," replied Akane with a small shrug. She<br/>grabbed the woman around her waist and hugged her.<br/>"I'll really miss you, Miss Yohiko."<p>"It won't be the same without you here dear,"<br/>replied the woman with a short nod. "It'll be a<br/>lot more peaceful," she thought to herself.<p>"Yes," said Akane as she let go and stepped<br/>back with a blush on her face as she realized that<br/>the woman's breasts almost completely enveloped<br/>her head.<p>"Send me an invitation to the wedding all<br/>right? I'll try to make it. It would be nice to<br/>see the boy again, he was very nice, if a little<br/>absent minded."<p>"I promise I will!" said the teary eyed girl<br/>as she turned and dashed away suddenly.<p>"That was unusual," commented Yohiko as she<br/>noted the abruptness of the girl's exit.<p>Yohiko smirked to herself and stopped walking<br/>towards the building. She turned and noticed that<br/>the students were starting to file in. "Hmmm..."<p>++++++++++++<p>"Why are you standing here?"<p>Tatewaki Kuno turned to look at the woman who<br/>had asked him the question and nodded his<br/>greeting. "Ah, my beloved..."<p>She punched him in the gut and stopped the<br/>speech rather quickly. "Just answer the question."<p>"I await my love, Akane Tendo, so that we<br/>might spar this day. I must prove my love..." He<br/>was cut off as she leveled a glare at him. "Off<br/>school grounds of course."<p>"Of course," she said with a smirk forming on<br/>her lips. "Sorry to tell you, Akane Tendo isn't<br/>coming to school anymore."<p>"So, she has sought the path of an honorable<br/>housewife to prepare for her life with myself! Oh,<br/>I knew it must be so. She pines away for me in her<br/>bridal training!"<p>"You know, you're not that far off the mark,<br/>but no. She isn't at home pining for you. She<br/>decided to move in with her fiancee."<p>Kuno froze. "Pardon?"<p>"She went to live with her fiancee," replied<br/>Yohiko calmly.<p>"So! The cur, Saotome, has decided to return<br/>at last? I shall destroy him..."<p>"Actually, it isn't Ranma. I believe the boy's<br/>name is...Shinnosuke. I think that's right."<br/>Yohiko pondered for a moment. "He lives in some<br/>legendary valley or something, no big deal. She<br/>left this morning."<p>"What?" roared the boy. "I shall not allow<br/>it!"<p>"There really isn't anything you can do about<br/>it," said the woman cheerfully. She was enjoying<br/>this a little too much. "She's already gone, and<br/>she seemed quite happy with her decision."<p>"Base lies!" snarled Kuno.<p>The woman put him into a rather painful<br/>headlock. "Are you calling me a liar?"<p>Kuno started to sweat nervously. "No, you must<br/>have been fooled by the foul sorcerer's illusion!"<p>"Oh, well then," she said as she released him.<br/>"I suppose I can accept that."<p>"I must go and save her from..."<p>"Well, you don't know where she is," said<br/>Yohiko cheerfully.<p>Kuno stopped moving and looked at her. "What?"<p>"You don't know where she is," repeated the<br/>woman.<p>By this point, students who were absorbing the<br/>information for spreading within the student<br/>population surrounded them.<p>"Tell me! I must save her..."<p>"My! Tatewaki, you aren't planning to skip<br/>school today are you? You don't look sick to me.<br/>I'm sure your father would be delighted to hear<br/>that!"<p>"Indeed, he understands the concept of Honor<br/>on some level then..."<p>"I understand he just bought a new set of<br/>barber's sheers and is just itching to try them<br/>out!" said the woman happily.<p>Kuno froze and went as white as a sheet.<br/>"Perhaps, I shall wait until later to rescue my<br/>love. It would not do for such a noble person as<br/>myself to fall behind in his studies."<p>"Quite," replied Yohiko.<p>The boy staggered towards his first class in a<br/>rather pathetic display.<p>"Next," said Yohiko to herself as she noticed<br/>Shampoo and Ukyo approaching.<p>"Hello girls," said the woman as she walked up<br/>to them.<p>"Miss Yohiko?" said Ukyo dumbly. It was very<br/>unusual to see her outside of the room this late<br/>in the morning. Especially since Ranma had left<br/>them.<p>"It's nice to see you today," said the woman<br/>as she grinned at the pair.<p>"What is teacher wanting?" said Shampoo as she<br/>looked up at her. She was wearing her usual<br/>Chinese clothes, but had a school bag slung over<br/>her shoulder. Enrolling in Furinkan was one of<br/>Cologne's ploys to keep the girl occupied and away<br/>from her 'Airen'.<p>"Well, I thought you might want to know that<br/>Akane is leaving," said the woman.<p>"Huh?" muttered Ukyo.<p>"Yes, she's moving in with her new fiancee."<p>"Shampoo not care," said the girl sourly.<p>"I knew that Old Man Tendo was a jerk. He's<br/>gotten her engaged again?" snapped Ukyo angrily.<p>"Actually, he doesn't know yet. She stopped by<br/>to say goodbye before she left and told me,"<br/>replied Yohiko cheerfully. "His name is<br/>Shinnosuke. He's a very nice boy, I met him once.<br/>I think she'll be happy with him."<p>"Is good," said Shampoo with a shrug.<p>"I guess," muttered Ukyo. She had no real<br/>anger for the girl, and even considered her<br/>somewhat of a friend. The information had a plus<br/>side as well. Akane was out of her way in her<br/>revenge on Ranma.<p>"It seems the troupe is drifting apart," said<br/>Yohiko with a wistful smile on her face as she<br/>watched them leave.<p>++++++++++++<p>"You're late, Miss Tendo," said Yohiko as she<br/>sat behind her desk and remained looking down at<br/>the book in her hands.<p>Nabiki handed her a note from the office and<br/>shrugged. "I had some personal business to take<br/>care of at home."<p>"Yes, Akane told me she was leaving today.<br/>Take your seat," said the woman as she pointed at<br/>the desk. "I think everyone in the school knows<br/>about it by now."<p>Nabiki's jaw dropped like a rock. "Huh?"<p>"I told them. What are you gonna do about it?"<br/>said the woman's confident smirk as she eyed the<br/>girl for a moment. "Are you just going to stand<br/>there?"<p>Nabiki hung her head and slowly stalked<br/>towards her desk. She was out of the loan<br/>sharking, gambling, and photo business. Selling<br/>information wasn't illegal though, and she had<br/>continued that part of her business despite the<br/>fall of her blackmailer.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"You had no right," seethed Nabiki as she<br/>glared at the woman during the lunch break.<p>"Oh? Didn't I?" said Yohiko calmly as she<br/>watched the girl coolly. They were standing in the<br/>hall, opposing one another.<p>"Akane was my sister," said Nabiki in<br/>frustration.<p>"Really? What do you think Kuno would have<br/>done when you told him?"<p>"What does it matter?" snapped the girl as she<br/>turned her head away.<p>"You'll notice that he's still here, whether<br/>or not that lasts all day is still in question,<br/>but he is still here."<p>Nabiki blinked. "What?"<p>"He'd have gone charging off after her. You<br/>would have worded telling Shampoo and Ukyo<br/>differently, making them think that Akane was with<br/>Ranma," continued the woman as she turned her head<br/>away from her in a mocking gesture. "Sending both<br/>of them after her as well."<p>Nabiki looked at the floor. "It's none of your<br/>business."<p>"Akane is something of a friend, at least to<br/>Miss Yohiko," replied the woman with a shrug.<p>"She hates you," snapped Nabiki.<p>"The real me, yes," agreed the woman. "I find<br/>myself liking her a little anyway. Strange girl,<br/>hot tempered, even a little violent. Still, she<br/>has a good heart, if not a good head on her<br/>shoulders."<p>Nabiki growled.<p>"You don't have the right to ruin this for<br/>her. She finally has the chance to be happy, and<br/>escape from this place. Something I've noticed<br/>you're longing to do."<p>Nabiki's frowned deepened.<p>"Akane got out first, and you're jealous.<br/>Don't try to pass this off as something for the<br/>family, or protecting her. Shinnosuke is<br/>honorable, and a good man. He will make her happy<br/>I believe."<p>"What do you mean jealous?" snapped Nabiki.<p>"You're as much of a brat as she is at times,<br/>Nabiki," said the woman as her features lightened.<br/>"You're throwing a tantrum because she left you<br/>behind to move on with her life, instead of the<br/>other way around."<p>"I like Nerima fine," said the girl angrily.<p>"Really? Then why are all the colleges you're<br/>trying for happen to be as far away from here as<br/>you can manage?"<p>Nabiki froze and stared at her.<p>"I've been keeping an eye on you, and your<br/>academics. It is my job Nabiki. You show a lot of<br/>promise, and you'll succeed I think, probably<br/>quite easily. However, don't drag down your<br/>sister's one chance at happiness now. You'll<br/>regret it later."<p>The girl turned away from her, angrily at<br/>first as she stormed away. Her hurried walk slowed<br/>to a snails pace as she moved away and mulled over<br/>the problem silently.<p>Yohiko smirked and strolled towards the<br/>teacher's lounge for her lunch.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"You goin to da date wit da big..."<p>The door to the lounge exploded as Kochou Kuno<br/>flew from the room. Yohiko strolled out and dusted<br/>off her hands as she turned towards her next class<br/>as the bell rang. "Give it up you loser."<p>The rest of the day was uneventful.<p>+++++++++++<p>Usagi frowned as she glared daggers into the<br/>back of Jadeite's head. He was three feet in front<br/>of her, sitting at his desk with a smirk on his<br/>face as he ignored the lesson and seemed to<br/>daydream.<p>"Nothing, I can't do anything!" she growled<br/>mentally. School had become one long frustration.<br/>Her work was suffering because of it and she knew<br/>it. "If only I could get that bastard, I could go<br/>back to normal again!" She frowned at the thought.<br/>Perhaps normal wasn't a good word for it, she'd at<br/>least be able to study again.<p>The boy glanced back at her over his shoulder<br/>and smirked. It had frightened her the first time<br/>he'd done that. She was wondering if he'd<br/>discovered her secret. However, as much as she<br/>watched him, she'd realized he did that to pretty<br/>much all the girls.<p>Most of them pined for him, asked him out,<br/>practically threw themselves at him. She wondered<br/>if they would if they really knew. "Well, Mitsuki<br/>probably would, but not the others," she thought<br/>to herself a little nervously as she took a glance<br/>towards the quiet looking girl in the front row.<p>Who knows what the school would think if they<br/>knew the teacher's pet kept a leather bodice and<br/>crotchless vinyl panties in her gym bag. She was<br/>thankful that the deodorant the girl had asked her<br/>to fetch for her in the locker room one day wasn't<br/>any deeper than that. She didn't want to know what<br/>was under those.<p>The bell rang and the students stood up to go<br/>to lunch.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Isn't he dreamy?" said one of the girls in<br/>the group she ate lunch with.<p>Usagi frowned and glared at Jadeite on the<br/>opposite side of the field. "No. I think he's a<br/>jerk."<p>The two girls on either side of her looked at<br/>her as if she'd grown a second head.<p>"What?" gasped the one on her right.<p>"You can't be serious! He's always so polite,<br/>so dashing! He treats all the girls so, so..."<p>"Romantically!" finished the other as the<br/>first girl struggled to find the right word.<p>"That's just a front. He's a monster," growled<br/>Usagi.<p>"You sound like you know something," said the<br/>one on her right with a seriously worried gasp.<p>"It's nothing. I can just tell, he's hiding<br/>something, and it isn't good," said the girl as<br/>she continued to glare at the boy.<p>"You're just being paranoid," said the other<br/>girl.<p>"I only wish I was," she thought to herself.<br/>"I don't like him, besides, I've got..." she cut<br/>herself off abruptly.<p>Both girls squealed as they jumped in front of<br/>her. "Tell us! You've met someone haven't you!<br/>Details! Details!" They both said this in a rather<br/>disturbing unison.<p>Usagi blushed badly and turned her head away.<br/>"His name is Ryoga, he doesn't go here."<p>"What's he like?" cried one of the girls.<p>"Just Ryoga?" said the other one in confusion.<p>Usagi blinked and stared at the second girl.<br/>"You know, I don't think I ever asked him what his<br/>family name was."<p>"You mean you don't know?" said the pair at<br/>the same time again.<p>"No," muttered Usagi in a sort of surprise.<br/>"He's always been so mysterious..."<p>"A mysterious and handsome man? Wai!" cried<br/>one of the girls.<p>"That sounds so romantic!" agreed the other.<p>"Yeah, I suppose it is," said Usagi.<p>"Where does he live? Can we meet him?" asked<br/>the pair.<p>"I don't know. We just sort of keep bumping<br/>into one another," said Usagi as she blushed<br/>again.<p>"Um, you're dating right?" said the first one<br/>as she looked at her friend oddly.<p>"Yeah! Of course we are!" said Usagi crossly.<p>"You don't know where he lives?" said the<br/>other one dumbly.<p>"It...never came up," said the pigtailed girl<br/>lamely.<p>"Usa-chan! I can't believe you!" said one of<br/>the girls in a scandalized tone. "Secret<br/>rendezvous!"<p>"Yeah, kinda," commented the girl to herself.<br/>She seemed to realize all at once that Ryoga had<br/>no idea who she really was. He'd only known her as<br/>Sailor Moon, he'd never even seen the real her.<br/>Not that there was much difference, only her hair<br/>color and outfit changed really. "I should do<br/>something about that...but not yet." Doubt started<br/>to form in her mind.<p>"What if Ryoga only likes blondes? What if<br/>he's some sort of bum? I've never seen his house!<br/>What if..." She sighed and hung her head.<p>"Hello," said a familiar voice.<p>Usagi and her friends looked up to see Jadeite<br/>standing over them with his confident smirk on his<br/>face.<p>"What is it?" said Usagi coldly. Her heart was<br/>racing. "Does he know?" screamed her mind. Her<br/>clothes shifted slightly against her skin, ready<br/>to spring to action in defense of her friends.<p>Jadeite ignored the two girls on either side<br/>of her and stared directly at Usagi. "Have...we<br/>met somewhere before? I keep thinking we have, and<br/>it's been bugging me for a while now. I can't<br/>place you."<p>"No," said the girl firmly as she glared up at<br/>him, her eyes challenging him to try something.<p>"Are you certain? I'm pretty sure. I can't<br/>figure it out though," he said as he continued to<br/>look down at her a little harder than before.<p>"I don't think so," she insisted calmly. A war<br/>was going on between their eyes.<p>"Hmmm. Maybe I've just seen you walking around<br/>town before," he said with a shrug as he turned<br/>away and left them.<p>Usagi continued to glare at him as he moved<br/>away.<p>"Sorry to bother you then," he said as he<br/>waved at them with his back turned as he walked.<p>"Did...he just hit on Usagi?" muttered one of<br/>the girls dumbly.<p>"Waaaahhh! I wish he'd done that to me! He<br/>would pick the one girl who doesn't like him!"<br/>cried the other.<p>Usagi merely looked down at the half empty<br/>bento in her lap and growled. "Damn! Does he know?<br/>Is he just toying with me? Is it that he suspects<br/>and he's trying to figure it out? Or is it just<br/>that he really thinks I'm someone he's just seen<br/>before?" She sighed and slowly started eating<br/>again, knowing the questions would go unanswered<br/>for some time to come.<p>++++++++++++<p>Jadeite turned around a corner to a deserted<br/>area of the school grounds and smirked at the<br/>figure who stood before him. "Hello Jadeite."<p>"You're toying with her," said Xellos calmly.<p>"So what?" he snorted casually as he leaned<br/>against the wall and crossed his arms over his<br/>chest.<p>"You're treading on dangerous waters," said<br/>Xellos with a slight anger in his eyes.<p>"Are you afraid you might get blamed for<br/>this?"<p>"I'm not worried about this one, they don't<br/>know how much of my power I've retained in this<br/>world. They aren't a danger to me here."<p>"It still isn't wise to cross them too much,"<br/>said Jadeite with a small chuckle. "I'll do my<br/>job, don't worry."<p>"Me? Worry about you? You can get yourself<br/>destroyed on this world for all I care. We both<br/>know not much will come of a death here for any of<br/>us."<p>"Hurt her, and L-sama could be angry. That's<br/>unwise," said Xellos. "There are certain things we<br/>can't do, and you know it."<p>"What? You're worried about that? Ha!" said<br/>Jadeite calmly. "I'm just pulling her chain a<br/>little. I remember what I'm supposed to do here.<br/>She's nothing more than an irritation. It's hard<br/>to work around her that way."<p>"Heh. I've been keeping up my end, it's almost<br/>time," said Xellos. "Just don't screw up yours."<p>"Right," said Jadeite casually. "You worry too<br/>much. I'll make sure the brat is there. We still<br/>have a little time before things come to a head."<p>"Don't get careless and let her kill you in<br/>that body. They need to be apart from the<br/>beginning. Your current activity is secondary to<br/>that, don't forget it," replied Xellos.<p>"I'm..."<p>"Seriously limited, unlike me. You need to<br/>watch yourself, don't get cocky or careless. That<br/>child is quite capable of killing you under the<br/>right circumstances. I'm not telling you to stop<br/>playing your little game, but don't get stupid. We<br/>have other objectives."<p>"Right," grumbled Jadeite as he turned away.<br/>"Just don't forget that I'm not your servant<br/>Jadeite."<p>"I'll try to remember that," said Xellos as he<br/>vanished into the shadows.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Oh, Tamahome! No! You can't..."<p>"Sir!" cried a voice as the door behind Tanaka<br/>opened suddenly. He jerked upright and quickly hid<br/>what was in his hands under the desk. His back was<br/>facing the door and he frowned deeply.<p>"You didn't see anything did you?" he snapped<br/>angrily.<p>"No sir! I didn't see you reading your shojo<br/>manga again sir!" said the man firmly.<p>"Good. What is it?" snapped Tanaka as he<br/>turned and looked at the man behind him.<p>"They're here sir!" said the large man as he<br/>stepped aside.<p>"Good!" said the small Japanese man as he<br/>stood up and dusted off his jacket lapel. He was<br/>wearing a dark blue business suit. His tie was<br/>perfectly in place and he stood up from the small<br/>cluttered desk. "Is everything ready?"<p>"Yes sir, everything is set," said the man<br/>calmly as he motioned with his arm for the man to<br/>move by him.<p>"Excellent," replied Tanaka coldly as he<br/>stepped out into the large warehouse.<p>Inside were hundreds of machine parts, motors<br/>and various other car parts were stacked high into<br/>the air within the almost pitch black room.<p>Standing in the center of the room, were<br/>several men who were also dressed in suits. They<br/>were grouped together defensively, with some of<br/>the men carrying briefcases.<p>Tanaka smirked as he noticed the older man<br/>standing in the middle of the men. He was dressed<br/>in what appeared to be samurai clothing. A sword<br/>hung from his side and a scowl was on his aged<br/>face.<p>"Tanaka, what is this?" said the old man<br/>angrily. "We've got business to discuss, and I<br/>don't like waiting."<p>"I apologize," said Tanaka with a small bow.<br/>The only other man in the room was his own<br/>bodyguard; the man who had fetched him.<p>"Well, we should get this over with," snorted<br/>the old man.<p>"Yes, I agree," said Tanaka as he pulled a<br/>pair of glasses out of his pocket and put them on<br/>his face casually.<p>"Your boss must relinquish control of the<br/>southern pier to me by midnight on Friday of next<br/>week," stated the old man calmly. "Those are my<br/>terms, no negotiations. I hold control of the<br/>surrounding area, and will take it by force if<br/>need be."<p>"So you say," said Tanaka calmly.<p>"What is this?" snapped the man as his scowl<br/>deepened.<p>"My employer does not agree with that<br/>assessment," said the small man with a serious<br/>expression on his face. "We will hold the property<br/>quite easily."<p>"Bah," snorted the old man in disgust. "You<br/>overestimate your resources, and underestimate my<br/>own. Tell that fool that he is as stupid as he<br/>ever was! Where is he! I was supposed to meet him<br/>here. I didn't come all this way just to look at<br/>your disgusting face!"<p>Tanaka smirked and shook his head. "He's not<br/>here. I don't think you'll be taking that property<br/>if you never give the order."<p>The old man stepped back in shock. "What is<br/>this?"<p>"A trap," said Tanaka as a huge stack of<br/>engines fell in front of him, creating a huge<br/>burst of noise and hiding him and his bodyguard<br/>from view.<p>"What? You said the building was clear!"<br/>snapped the old man as he turned to look at his<br/>men.<p>"There's no one in here but us!" cried the man<br/>next to him as he showed the old man a thermal<br/>readout on the small laptop computer at his side.<p>A low humming noise suddenly started in front<br/>of them. Something like a pressurized thump hit<br/>the ground, and then the noise repeated. It<br/>sounded like mechanical footsteps.<p>"You are mistaken," said a new voice from the<br/>shadows. It was a heavily accented gaijin voice.<p>"Who is there?" cried the old man angrily as<br/>he raised his arm into the air.<p>The briefcases the men around him were<br/>carrying were opened within a split second, all of<br/>them were now armed with small automatic weapons.<p>"You were supposed to come unarmed," said the<br/>voice coldly.<p>"Yes, a trap for my old rival, it seems we<br/>think alike," said the old man with a chuckle.<p>"Not really, my employer was smart enough not<br/>to come," said Tanaka's voice from a speaker<br/>system somewhere in the room.<p>"A fitting deception. It seems we have a<br/>standoff. We'll be leaving now," said the old man<br/>calmly as he turned to walk away.<p>The sound of automatic gunfire exploded from<br/>the shadows and one of his bodyguards' head<br/>exploded in a spray of red.<p>"There!" cried the others as they fired in the<br/>direction the shot had come from. Bullets filled<br/>the air, ricocheting off of metal as they vanished<br/>into the shadows.<p>"You missed," said the old man as he started<br/>walking away again.<p>"No, I hit exactly what I was aiming for,"<br/>said the gajin's voice.<p>"What?" said the old man in disbelief.<p>The strange mechanical sound started again,<br/>much faster this time as it moved closer, still<br/>cloaked in shadows.<p>The men saw something moving towards them, a<br/>huge mass of shadows and darkness. They fired on<br/>it, but it didn't even stop its momentum as it<br/>charged forward.<p>The last thing the old man saw was a huge<br/>metal claw reaching for his face.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Heh, our trap was better," said Tanaka as he<br/>watched the scene play out before him. The muffled<br/>sounds of desperate gunfire halted suddenly as a<br/>large caliber weapon came to life and decimated<br/>the small band of Yakuza.<p>"Yes sir," said his assistant calmly.<p>"Vahn, are you finished yet?" he asked over<br/>the intercom.<p>"They are dead," said the calm voice icily.<p>"I can see that," replied Tanaka.<p>"Good, I grow tired of this though," said the<br/>voice.<p>"Patience. You'll get your revenge," said<br/>Tanaka coldly. "Your life belongs to us though.<br/>Don't forget that. We gave you everything, and you<br/>were dead when we found you."<p>"I was alive," replied the voice. "Now I am<br/>dead."<p>"You might as well have been dead," snorted<br/>Tanaka without much interest. "This 'Shadow' will<br/>show up sooner or later. When he interferes with<br/>our operations again, you can have him. We don't<br/>need you tearing around Tokyo looking for him. As<br/>strong as you are, it won't take long for the JSDF<br/>to destroy you. You can't hide easily as you are."<p>"I understand," said the voice.<p>"See that you don't forget that," said Tanaka.<br/>"We can protect you from that, you're quite useful<br/>to us."<p>"I can hide, but I will not forget my debt,"<br/>said Vahn. "I will fulfill my end. I will destroy<br/>the Shadow, and finally avenge myself and my<br/>brothers."<p>"Yes, do that," said Tanaka in a patronizing<br/>tone. "Until then, you remain patient."<p>"I do not like being patient," snapped Vahn.<p>"Well, I could shut you down, and put someone<br/>else inside that thing. It would be quite painful,<br/>but I'm sure we could find a more willing<br/>volunteer..."<p>"No. I will wait...for now."<p>"Good boy."<p>++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Jadeite Strikes!<p>
