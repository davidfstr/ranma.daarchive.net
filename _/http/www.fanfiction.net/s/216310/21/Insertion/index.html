</div>Insertion<p>Part 21<p>The best made plans...<p>+++++++++++++<p>"What are you doing?" muttered the golden haired youma as she<br/>walked up to her dark haired companion.<p>"Ah, Tochi. Are you well?" said the young boy as he turned to face<br/>her. He was sitting in front of a mirror with an image of deep space<br/>fading in and out of the glass.<p>"Incredibly bored. Takibi is having all the fun," replied the<br/>woman irritably.<p>"Hmm, you'll like this then," replied the boy.<p>"What is it?" she said as she leaned forward, resting her chest on<br/>top of his head.<p>"Did you ever wonder what happened to the imperial fleet? I mean,<br/>it wasn't destroyed, Serenity didn't have the chance to call it in to<br/>defend against that idiot Beryl's forces. Where did it go?"<p>"What?" said the woman as she stood up and looked at him.<p>"The answer is quite simple really, she sealed it away with the<br/>Senshi. Those seals are weakening, and now...ahhhh..." The boy's dark<br/>grin widened as the image suddenly became clear. There was a<br/>distortion in space, a blue swirl of power. In an instant it was over,<br/>and several large starships appeared out of nowhere.<p>"That's it?" she muttered.<p>The boy frowned at her and snorted. "Don't be silly. I couldn't<br/>pull them all through, besides, how many do you think we need? Those<br/>are Destroyer and Galaxy class starships."<p>They looked like nothing more than seven gray slivers in an<br/>endless sea of stars. She smiled and nodded at him. "I see."<p>"The thing is, it's going to be about six months before they<br/>arrive here," said the boy calmly. "We're going to play along with the<br/>senile queen until then. Understand?"<p>She nodded and kissed him on the cheek. "You are a genius, Kuroi."<p>"Where is Ekitai?" said the boy as he frowned at her and glanced<br/>around.<p>"Oh, he's off doing who knows what," said the woman. "You know<br/>him."<p>"Yes, he's powerful, second only to me. However, he's too easily<br/>distracted. That makes him our weakest link."<p>As if on cue a short pink thing walked into the room grinning<br/>madly at the other two. It laughed and glared at them with its wild<br/>black eyes. A sort of tentacle like dorsal stuck up on top of its head<br/>and it jumped up and down excitedly.<p>"Really Ekitai," said the woman with a bored expression on her<br/>face.<p>The thing's face became serious suddenly. "The humans have become<br/>quite imaginative. I like this thing they call 'Anime'."<p>"You're supposed to be watching Takebi," said Kuroi flatly.<br/>"Making sure that temper of his doesn't make him do something stupid."<p>"Ha! I'm watching him right now," replied Ekitai flatly. He tossed<br/>a small piece of candy on the floor and shot a stream of liquid onto<br/>it from his palm. It grew into Takebi after a few seconds and the fire<br/>Youma sputtered angrily. "See," commented Ekitai.<p>"How dare you!" snarled Takebi as he whirled around to face his<br/>tormentor. Flames danced across his body and he glared at him<br/>hatefully.<p>The pink thing's body began to expand as well, and soon a tall and<br/>fit looking man dressed in blue appeared. He smirked coldly and<br/>crossed his arms over his chest, pushing aside his long blue hair as<br/>he did so. "What are you going to do?"<p>The red haired youma growled under his breath, but backed down.<p>"Ha! Your failure hasn't been forgotten," snapped Ekitai<br/>arrogantly.<p>"I didn't fail. My mission was completed successfully," retorted<br/>the angry man bitterly.<p>"It's a moot point, now you've got to figure something else out,"<br/>said the female youma lazily. "It's not that big of a deal really.<br/>Those weapons aren't of any real use against us."<p>"They hurt," snapped Takebi bitterly.<p>"He does have the potential to harm us," said Kuroi calmly as he<br/>turned to face them. "That is not acceptable. He must be eliminated;<br/>Takebi should be well enough to do it now. Have him take Genaku out,<br/>and get those Senshi while you're at it. They'll make good practice.<br/>Don't be an idiot, and don't try it when they are together."<p>"The senshi hate him as much as we do," pointed out Tochi.<p>"They will work together if properly motivated I think," replied<br/>the boy calmly. "That is something we don't want. As Beryl has taught<br/>us, they are resourceful if nothing else. Dealing with them all at<br/>once isn't advised. Our best bet is to make sure they stay at odds,<br/>and ensure that they fight each other as much as us."<p>"And how do we do that?" asked Takebi.<p>"We don't have to, they're doing it themselves at the moment. I'll<br/>keep an eye on things though."<p>"Right," said the three other Youma.<p>"In six months time, it won't matter anyway," said the boy coldly.<br/>"The entire planet will simply be cleansed in a hail of fire from the<br/>heavens."<p>"Then we can wake up Metallia?" said Tochi cheerfully.<p>"Why bother?" replied Kuroi flatly. "The planet will be ours, what<br/>do we need Metallia for? She'll simply put us back where she got us. I<br/>like being out here, and I'm not going back."<p>The three other youma blinked in surprise. None of them said a<br/>word in argument though.<p>+++++++++++<p>Soun and Genma were staring at Happosai in horror. Behind the<br/>shriveled old man, Ranma stood with her arms crossed over her chest.<br/>She was grinning as she watched the expressions on the two men's<br/>faces.<p>"M-master!" cried Soun.<p>Genma stumbled back; pouring a glass of water over his head before<br/>the old man could notice him.<p>"Thank goodness you're safe!" cried Soun as he pulled the man into<br/>a tight embrace. After a moment, he attacked the old man while he was<br/>still in his grip.<p>A second later, Happosai stood on top of the beaten Soun smoking<br/>his pipe lazily.<p>"This is funny and all, but don't you have something to do here?"<br/>said Ranma calmly.<p>"Yes! Of course!" exclaimed the old man as he looked up at Soun<br/>for a moment. "You come over here too, Saotome. I've got something to<br/>tell the both of you!" snapped the old man angrily.<p>"I'm just a cute panda!" said Genma's sign.<p>"He knows about Jusenkyo pop," replied Ranma calmly as she leaned<br/>against the wall.<p>"Traitor!" said the next sign.<p>"Get your fat butts over here!" snapped Happosai at the two men.<br/>"Relax, I'm not here for revenge."<p>The two men seemed to calm at that announcement, and cowered<br/>before the old man for a moment, bowing deeply. "What is it Master?"<br/>whined Soun.<p>"I've come to train my true heir to the Anything Goes School,"<br/>said the old man as he gave a sagely looking nod.<p>Ranma stood behind the men, blocking their retreat. She grabbed<br/>them by their shoulders and held them in place.<p>"What are you doing, Son?" said Soun.<p>"Get out of the way boy!" said the panicked Genma's sign.<p>"I don't think so," replied the redhead with a slight shake of her<br/>head. "I want to ask you something first old man."<p>"What is it?" said Genma's next sign.<p>"Is this really...the great and terrible master? The one you've<br/>been shaking in terror of for as long as I can remember? The horrible<br/>demon thing that tormented you for all those years?"<p>"Yes! Now move!" snapped Soun desperately.<p>"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!" Ranma fell over on the floor clutching<br/>his stomach. "You're scared of this little wrinkled twerp?"<p>Happosai glared at the boy for a moment. "What did you call me?"<p>"You've really got these two idiots terrified of you, you know<br/>that old man?" said the redhead with a small giggle.<p>"And they should be!" snapped Happosai as he glared at them.<br/>"However, they won't be my heir. I need someone younger, and<br/>gullible...er...smarter."<p>"Hmmm?" said the redhead with a slight smirk forming on her face.<p>Soun and Genma were both breathing sighs of relief at that<br/>announcement.<p>"Hey Ranma. Who's this?" said Akane as she walked down the stairs<br/>behind them.<p>"Huh?" said the girl as she turned to look up at her.<p>"Who?" muttered Happosai as he turned to see Akane Tendo. "You<br/>must be...Akane..."<p>"Yeah. Who are you?" said the girl cheerfully as she paused about<br/>halfway down the steps. She was dressed in one of her black suits<br/>again and looked like she was about to go out somewhere.<p>"Akane!" cried the old man as he jumped forward with his arms<br/>spread wide.<p>The girl's eyes went wide as she jumped back and reached into her<br/>coat.<p>Ranma jumped back away from the pair. "No! Don't!"<p>A loud explosion echoed through the home and Ranma stared at the<br/>smoking hole in the ground dumbly. Akane had been thrown back to near<br/>the top of the stairs and slowly staggered back to her feet.<p>Soun and Genma were merely staring at the scene in shock. Neither<br/>of them could speak.<p>"You...killed him," muttered Ranma as he looked at the large hole<br/>in the floor and stared up at her for a moment.<p>"What was that thing? Was it a youma?" sputtered the girl.<p>Ranma blinked and looked up at her for a moment. "Um, yeah..." She<br/>turned towards their parents and frowned for a moment as they merely<br/>stared dumbly.<p>"Shit, there goes that plan out the window," muttered the boy as<br/>he looked at the hole for a moment.<p>"Master?" mumbled Soun.<p>"Akane?" said Genma as he looked at the girl for a moment.<p>Ranma reached into her shirt and took out his neuralizer. He put<br/>on his shades and Akane did the same. He flashed the two men and<br/>nodded towards the girl. She put the weapon back in her coat and<br/>frowned.<p>"Jeez Akane, you didn't have to punch him so hard," said Ranma as<br/>she looked directly at the two men.<p>"Um...sorry..." said the girl with a heavy blush on her face.<p>"Akane...you killed the master?" said Soun as he slowly stood to<br/>his feet and walked towards her.<p>Genma took a moment longer to snap out of his daze and shook his<br/>head.<p>"Master?" muttered the girl in horror. "You mean...that wasn't<br/>a..."<p>"Oh! You've made your father very proud Akane!" cried Soun as he<br/>rushed up and grabbed her in a tight embrace.<p>"What?" said the girl.<p>"You've freed us from that demon's torment! Oh! To have you as my<br/>future daughter in law!" said Genma with tears in his eyes. "It makes<br/>me so proud!"<p>"Ranma, what's going on?" muttered the girl as she shook her<br/>father off.<p>"Nothing, you just killed a demon is all," replied the redhead<br/>with a slightly faked smile. It was a small white lie, but enough to<br/>calm her down a bit.<p>"Indeed!" agreed Soun.<p>Ranma was in a slight state of shock. His plan had been ruined.<br/>Now she had to think of another way to beat convince Cologne to teach<br/>him the technique. She paused and looked up at Akane for a moment.<br/>"I'm gonna go change."<p>++++++++++++<p>Several moments later Ranma was walking down the street with a<br/>frown on his face.<p>"That wasn't a demon was it?" asked Ranma.<p>"No. Losing Happosai isn't that big of a loss, believe me,"<br/>replied Carrot. "He was evil, and a real pervert."<p>"We should have done something. He didn't deserve to die!" cried<br/>Pissant.<p>"Yeah, he did," said Dan calmly. "We're not going to tell Akane<br/>what she did, she'd break down. We do need to do something so that it<br/>doesn't happen again."<p>"We'll worry about that later. Right now, we've got to find a way<br/>to get that ghoul to train us."<p>"We could just tell her what we need," said Dan.<p>"That would compromise too much," commented Carrot.<p>"Why?" muttered Pissant in confusion.<p>"What? We just walk in and tell her we want to kill some fire<br/>monster? Get real," commented Ranma.<p>They paused in the middle of the sidewalk and blinked. "You know.<br/>I never thought of that. It's not a bad idea," said Carrot dumbly.<p>"What?" said Ranma in confusion.<p>"We don't need to give her the particulars of the situation,"<br/>explained Carrot. "Just tell her that some fire demon is trying to<br/>kill us, and we weren't able to kill it with what we knew. She still<br/>wants us to marry Shampoo, so that would be enough to make her help<br/>us. It would be a shame if we were to die."<p>"Let's go to the Cat Cafe then," said Dan as he started moving<br/>foreword again.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo was in a state of shock. She was stepping out of her<br/>room when she saw her little sister blow away some shriveled up little<br/>troll. As soon as it had occurred, she had jumped back into her room<br/>before anyone noticed and watched the scene play out from a crack in<br/>her doorway.<p>Now, she simply sat with her back against her door staring at the<br/>wall. "What the hell was that?" she mumbled to herself.<p>Ranma, it had to be. But what though? She wasn't sure she wanted<br/>to know all that much anymore. The two had started talking about<br/>demons, and then did something to her father that made them forget<br/>what they had just seen. "I've got a feeling I'm in over my head on<br/>this one."<p>Still, it involved her sister. Plus there was the thing that drove<br/>her, the little voice in the back of her mind that just had to know.<br/>"I'm going to get to the bottom of this." She swore it silently to<br/>herself, taking care not to finish the statement with: "If it's the<br/>last thing I ever do."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma was walked up to the Cat Cafe and looked up at the sign.<br/>"Well, we're here."<p>"Not much of a place for your end, but that's also fitting in a<br/>way," said a voice from the rooftops.<p>Ranma looked up and growled. "Takibi?"<p>"Yes. I thought it would be wise to finish you off," replied the<br/>youma arrogantly as he stared down at the boy and smiled. He was<br/>standing on the edge of the roof.<p>"Didn't have enough last time?" snapped the boy as he moved into a<br/>combat stance.<p>"I intend to pay you back for every blow," replied the thing<br/>coldly as his body burst into flames.<p>"We're not wearing the shield," said Ranma to himself. "We're in<br/>deep shit."<p>Takibi jumped down onto the street. Even the hardened residents of<br/>Nerima knew enough to vacate the streets. Soon Ranma was standing<br/>alone with the thing.<p>"We're not strong enough to beat him yet. We've got to get away,"<br/>he thought as he spread his feet a little and grit his teeth.<p>"Die," said Takibi as he charged forward.<p>Ranma was thrown back by a burning right hook and landed in a pile<br/>of garbage. He rolled away from a jet of flames from the thing's hands<br/>and pulled out his weapons.<p>"Not this time," said Takibi coldly as he shot a concentrated beam<br/>of heat that struck the weapons.<p>Ranma screamed in pain as he was forced to drop them and backed<br/>away.<p>Takibi smirked as he melted them where they lay on the pavement.<br/>Within moments there was nothing more than a glowing red spot on a<br/>boiling puddle of concrete. "Now. You will not escape me."<p>"Shit!" muttered Ranma as he backed away slowly.<p>Takibi vanished and appeared behind him, thrusting his elbow into<br/>the boy's back. Ranma lashed out with a quick kick that merely bounced<br/>off of the youma harmlessly.<p>"Not so much bite this time," said the thing coldly.<p>Ranma rolled across the ground, putting out the flames on his back<br/>before he jumped back to his feet. "I'm not so easily killed."<p>"That's why I'm going to enjoy this so much," replied the youma.<p>Ranma rushed forward punching and kicking at the thing at top<br/>speed. His Kaio Ken attack barely allowing him to even stay close.<p>Takibi chuckled as he dodged and blocked strikes, causing the<br/>boy's clothes to burn as he attacked.<p>Ranma ignored the flames and jumped back. "Eat this! Moukou<br/>Takabishi!" A beam of energy shot from his hands and the youma<br/>vanished. The wall of a nearby shop was destroyed.<p>"Damn! He's too fast!" snarled Ranma as he spun around just in<br/>time to catch a punch aimed at his face.<p>"You're nothing. This isn't even sporting anymore. I think I'll<br/>just kill you and be done with it," said the Youma coldly.<p>"Katsutenshin Amaguriken Special!" cried Ranma as he launched his<br/>strongest attack at the thing.<p>Takibi was thrown into a wall and screamed in rage. "Damn you!<br/>That hurts!" he snarled as he jumped up again. He paused and looked<br/>around for a moment. The boy was gone. "I see..."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma staggered against a wall in a nearby alleyway and gasped for<br/>breath. He was beaten and burned. It wouldn't take long for Takibi to<br/>find him if he started looking. He glanced down at his watch and<br/>frowned, it was charred and broken. "Shit. We've got to keep moving<br/>and hope he doesn't look for us."<p>"I wouldn't worry about that," said a new voice.<p>Ranma turned to glare at the newcomer. "You!"<p>Tsuki stepped out of the shadows and smirked at him. "You're hurt?<br/>Too bad."<p>"What the hell do you want?" he snapped at her angrily.<p>"Nothing much, I'm just going to finish you off. You're a threat<br/>to the future. I can't allow that," replied the girl coldly.<p>Ranma stared at her. "You think you're strong enough to kill me<br/>alone?"<p>"Normally no. I just got lucky and watched you fight with that<br/>monster back there. I never expected to actually find you today."<p>The boy growled at her and staggered. "Damn."<p>"You barely have the strength to stand up, much less fight me off.<br/>Lucky break for me."<p>"Do you really have what it takes to take someone's life?" replied<br/>the boy coldly as he glared at her.<p>She smirked and pulled a long sword from some magical pocket in<br/>space. It was huge, the blade was about five feet long and at least<br/>three inches wide at the base. It was also glowing with a red energy<br/>of some kind. "Let's find out."<p>Ranma fell onto his back as he tried to step back and stumbled<br/>over a bag of garbage. He glared at her, staring her directly in the<br/>eyes.<p>She smiled as she pointed the sword at his neck and slowly moved<br/>forward.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"It can't end like this!" snapped Carrot angrily.<p>"We've got to do something!" said Dan desperately.<p>"We can barely move," said Ranma tensely.<p>"Pissant. You're the only one not hurt, can you get us out of<br/>here?" said Carrot desperately.<p>"Huh?" muttered the voice.<p>"Do something you idiot! You weren't fighting that thing with us!<br/>You can still move!"<p>"I won't hurt her," said the voice calmly.<p>"Then don't! Just get us the hell out of here!" snapped Dan.<p>"I can't move the body like you three can," replied the voice<br/>calmly.<p>"Shit!" said Carrot as the blade touched their throat. "Can you<br/>use that chi of yours to heal us? Maybe we can escape!"<p>Tsuki had frozen, her face growing very serious as she stared them<br/>directly in the eyes.<p>"Maybe..." said the voice nervously.<p>"We promise we won't hurt her! Just get us the hell out of here!"<br/>snapped Dan.<p>Pissant went silent, and a warm energy began to form around them.<p>++++++++++++<p>"He hurt Mistress Pluto," said Tsuki to herself as she stared into<br/>the eyes of Ranma Saotome. She could see the mixed emotions of anger,<br/>fear, and anxiety in them. "He's beaten my friends, tormented them,<br/>and even threatens the future." She poked the sword a little further<br/>down, forcing him to lower himself all the way to the ground. A small<br/>trickle of blood ran down his neck.<p>She looked deep into his eyes, not noticing the white glow forming<br/>around his body.<p>"I can't do it."<p>"Huh?" said the boy dumbly.<p>"I can't kill you..." she said with a frown forming on her face.<br/>"I don't know why."<p>The boy breathed a sigh of relief and the glow slowly faded from<br/>around him. She didn't appear to notice this. He laid his head back<br/>against the pavement and seemed to relax a bit.<p>"That doesn't mean I can't get rid of you," she said with a smirk<br/>forming on her face.<p>"What?" said the boy dumbly as he looked up at her face again.<p>"I call upon the power of Pluto, as a defender of the time gate. I<br/>banish you into the past, too far to harm the events leading into the<br/>future of our world. I'll send you back a few hundred years or so,<br/>that should be enough."<p>A staff shaped like a key appeared in her hand and she smiled at<br/>him coldly.<p>"Shit!" said the boy as the white glow formed around his body once<br/>again.<p>With a flash of light, he was gone. Nothing but a few small wisps<br/>of vapor gave any indication that he was ever there.<p>Tsuki frowned and looked at the staff for a moment. "It seemed<br/>stronger than it should have been."<p>+++++++++++<p>On a nearby rooftop, Takibi smirked to himself as he watched the<br/>scene play out. The young senshi vanished onto the shadows leaving him<br/>alone.<p>"It looks like she did my work for me. Those generals are no<br/>threat to me," he chuckled as he turned away. "With only those<br/>pathetic senshi and the generals in our way, victory is assured. Heh."<p>There was a small burst of flames, and he vanished as well.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Let me get this straight chap. I've got to get you a shrubbery<br/>before you'll let me pass?" said Ryoga as he arched his eyebrow and<br/>stared at the tall knights who stood in front of him. He was in a<br/>forest somewhere and really had no idea about the location.<p>"Nee!" cried the knights before the largest one.<p>"That is correct," said the head knight.<p>"No," replied the boy darkly as he narrowed his eyes at them.<p>"Oh come on. Please?"<p>"I'm going through these woods, and you can't stop me," he said<br/>coldly as he started walking.<p>"I shall say 'nee' to you again!" warned the knight.<p>"Blow it out your arse," replied the boy as he walked through the<br/>middle of the knights. They parted and let him through.<p>"Well, that wasn't very nice," said the large knight with a frown<br/>on his face.<p>"Nee!" cried his cohorts in agreement.<p>Ryoga calmly went on his way, a deep frown on his face as he<br/>walked. "Just you wait Ranma. I'll find you soon enough."<p>He walked into a swirling vortex of some kind that had appeared in<br/>front of him, not even seeming to notice as he did so.<p>"Well, can't say I didn't warn him," commented the knight with a<br/>shrug as he watched this.<p>"Nee!" agreed the others. The vortex closed after they had spoken<br/>the word and left them alone in the forest.<p>"Ooh! A traveling salesman!" cried the large knight as he noticed<br/>another victim walking through the woods towards them. "Places<br/>everyone!"<p>+++++++++++<p>Next Time: Trapped in the past!<p>
