</div>Insertion<p>Part 74<p>Dan vs. Nerima<p>+++++++++++++++<p>It was a cold morning; Dan stood overlooking<br/>the rooftops of Nerima with Kiima, a cold looking<br/>smirk on his face as he glared out at the burg.<br/>"Heh. So you want that map do you?"<p>"Yes," she replied calmly, a blanket wrapped<br/>around her shoulders.<p>"No problem, it won't be easy though," said<br/>Dan calmly. "I'll get it done. So relax."<p>She nodded and frowned slightly. "You're<br/>different than the others."<p>"Maybe," replied Dan with a chuckle. He turned<br/>to look at her and smirked. "See you later."<p>The woman nodded and looked uncomfortable<br/>again, she clutched the blanket a little tighter<br/>and looked away.<p>Dan jumped off the chimney and spread his<br/>wings. He soared off into the sky, leaving her<br/>sitting there with a frown on her face.<p>++++++++++++<p>In the air, a familiar voice piped up in Dan's<br/>mind.<p>"Was it right for us to do that to Mom?"<br/>whimpered Pissant.<p>"She's not our mother," replied Dan calmly.<p>"I know, but it still seems so...wrong,"<br/>muttered Pissant.<p>"Maybe it was, but I've got a feeling she<br/>won't be complaining much when we get back with<br/>that map," snorted Dan.<p>"The others will probably know what happened<br/>to us," replied Pissant. "Carrot will I think."<p>"You're right," agreed Dan. "That is, if they<br/>even realize we were gone at all. I doubt Xellos<br/>and Phibrizzo will let them in on it."<p>"What are we gonna do?" asked Pissant with a<br/>worried sounding tone.<p>"Kick Carrot's ass if he gets in the way, it<br/>won't take him long to figure this out, even if he<br/>doesn't know. We need to get to Plum."<p>"You're not going to attack Carrot are you?"<br/>whimpered the voice.<p>"Naw, he'll probably attack me, if not, we'll<br/>get our chance later. Heh." Dan narrowed his eyes<br/>and floated down towards the ground. "I'm debating<br/>whether or not we should even bother hiding."<p>"It would make things easier if they don't<br/>know," said Pissant.<p>"It's late, they'll know we've been gone,<br/>Carrot will suspect if nothing else."<p>"Still, we should try," grumbled Pissant.<p>"Your wussiness is starting to piss me off,"<br/>snorted Dan. "We're going to fight them sooner or<br/>later."<p>"Maybe not," muttered Pissant.<p>"Right, you keep thinkin that, I'm goin to get<br/>that map, don't get in the way," snorted Dan as he<br/>started walking towards the apartment. It was only<br/>a few blocks away, and he wanted some time to<br/>think before he got there.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Welcome back," said Carrot as Xellos appeared<br/>with the others at his side. They walked into the<br/>room and looked around.<p>Yohiko was wearing a bathrobe with a cup of<br/>coffee in her hands. "Morning."<p>Usagi walked out of the kitchen with some<br/>toast hanging from her mouth and smiled.<br/>"Gmrning."<p>"Well, we're back," said Phibrizzo. "How's it<br/>goin pop?"<p>Carrot snorted at this and nodded his head at<br/>the boy. "I thought you'd be here earlier than<br/>this."<p>"Where's Dan?" asked Xellos.<p>"You know where he is, and I'm worried about<br/>it," said Carrot as he frowned slightly.<p>Plum was sitting at the table looking around<br/>in confusion. "What?"<p>"One of us is missing?" asked Ryoga with a<br/>frown. "Why aren't you looking for him?"<p>"Because I already have a pretty good idea<br/>what happened to him," said Carrot with a small<br/>sigh.<p>Yusaku had a huge dumb looking grin on his<br/>face as he sat down. He didn't care what was going<br/>on, as long as he was back from that place the<br/>sorcerers had kept him for all those hours. He<br/>looked like he needed sleep, but it could wait a<br/>little longer.<p>"What happened to Dan?" asked Usagi in<br/>confusion. She sat down next to her new 'half-<br/>brother' and looked at him for a moment before<br/>turning back to the problem at hand.<p>"He probably got caught when he went out last<br/>night. I'm betting that chick brainwashed him, and<br/>he's working for them now," replied Carrot with a<br/>small sigh.<p>"What?" said Yohiko in shock.<p>"No big deal, he's probably having the time of<br/>his life. He needs to blow off some steam anyway,"<br/>said Carrot with a shrug.<p>"What?" replied most of the room dumbly.<p>"Those bird people have these egg things that<br/>take over people's minds and stuff. No big thing,"<br/>said Carrot calmly. "He's workin for Kiima."<p>"So, we have to fight Dan now?" asked Yohiko<br/>with a small snort.<p>"You don't sound very upset about that,"<br/>commented Xellos.<p>"None of us like each other much," replied<br/>Carrot as he shrugged. "I'd rather it was me, but<br/>I suppose Dan deserves to get himself a chick now<br/>and then too."<p>"Funny you should put it that way," commented<br/>Yohiko with a small frown.<p>"Yeah, no pun intended," said Carrot as he<br/>smiled at her.<p>"This is strange," said Plum as she frowned at<br/>the situation.<p>"I've seen worse," replied Usagi as she leaned<br/>her head on her palm and lost interest.<p>"Yeah, you get used to this sort of thing if<br/>you're around them a lot," said Phibrizzo<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Oh," said Plum as she shook her head. "Still,<br/>what we do now?"<p>"Well, Kiima will probably send Dan to get<br/>that map. I suppose we should try and stop him,"<br/>said Carrot with a small shrug.<p>"You don't sound very sure of that," commented<br/>Yohiko flatly.<p>"Well, sooner or later, we'll end up in China.<br/>L-sama isn't likely to let us off this easy," said<br/>Carrot as he sighed and turned to look at her.<br/>"You know how it is."<p>"Who's L-sama?" asked Usagi.<p>"God," said Carrot calmly.<p>"Yeah, him," agreed Yohiko.<p>Everyone in the room blinked and stared at<br/>them.<p>Xellos spoke up next. "Well, now that it's out<br/>of the way. What are you going to do now?"<p>"Ignore you, you're not going to help us<br/>anyway," said Carrot. "At least, not directly.<br/>Neither one of you idiots wants to get your hands<br/>dirty I'll bet."<p>"So cruel!" cried Phibrizzo in mock insult.<p>"Still, he's correct. We can't interfere. Not<br/>directly anyway," agreed Xellos. "We've got other<br/>concerns, remember?"<p>"Right," said Phibrizzo cheerfully.<p>"You're not planning on telling us what those<br/>concerns are?" said Yohiko.<p>"Nope," said Xellos cheerfully.<p>"So, these two are useless," said Carrot with<br/>a sigh.<p>"What are they talking about?" muttered Usagi<br/>as she looked at the adults for a moment and<br/>frowned.<p>"It's a secret," said Yohiko before Xellos<br/>could open his mouth to respond.<p>The Mazoku frowned and crossed his arms.<br/>"You're no fun."<p>The woman smirked and looked at Yusaku. "You<br/>go home and get some sleep before you pass out in<br/>that chair. We'll come and get you later on, if we<br/>need your help."<p>The man nodded his head and stood up, slowly<br/>walking towards the door.<p>Plum sighed and rested her head in her palms.<br/>"So, we wait for this Dan person now?"<p>"Basically. There isn't much else we can do,"<br/>replied Carrot.<p>"Can I go outside?" grumbled Usagi.<p>"No, put your wings away and just be patient,<br/>you'll be sick of them by the end of the week,<br/>believe me," replied Yohiko calmly.<p>Carrot smirked at this and turned his head<br/>towards Plum. "Give me that map will ya?"<p>The girl looked up at him and frowned. "What<br/>for?"<p>"Would you rather have Dan attack you to get<br/>it, or me? He's going to head right for you,<br/>unless he knows someone else has it," said Carrot<br/>as he smirked at her. "I'll take Usagi outside,<br/>we'll get some training in, she can break in her<br/>wings, and Dan will have something besides our<br/>apartment to blow up. I'd like to get our deposit<br/>back ya know."<p>Yohiko turned her head towards the shattered<br/>window and frowned. "What's left of it anyway."<p>"Right, you get the idea then," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Carrot smirked as he stood off against Usagi<br/>in a small open lot near the home. "Well, your<br/>mother has been training you has she?"<p>"That's right," said the girl with a slightly<br/>nervous frown.<p>"Relax, I'll go easy on you. This is more to<br/>get you accustomed to your wings than anything<br/>else."<p>The girl blinked at this and smiled. "Really?"<p>"Right, you're going to be using them a lot in<br/>the near future I think, we've got to fight off an<br/>entire race of bird people after all," said the<br/>boy as he grinned at her.<p>"Sounds like fun!" she said cheerfully.<p>"Doesn't it though?" replied Carrot as he<br/>spread his feet apart and sprouted his wings. They<br/>flapped once before settling back in a folded<br/>position. "Go ahead, we'll probably get<br/>interrupted soon, but hey."<p>The girl nodded and sprouted her wings as<br/>well, flapping them and pulling herself off the<br/>ground. Carrot smirked and followed after her.<p>Usagi wobbled a bit, but soon found a<br/>comfortable rhythm and managed to hover about a<br/>hundred feet in the air. Carrot did the same and<br/>the pair faced off. Usagi took up a combat stance<br/>and frowned.<p>"What the hell are you doing?" asked Carrot as<br/>he smirked at her.<p>"What? I'm getting ready for you!" said the<br/>girl in confusion.<p>"You're acting like we're on the ground,<br/>you're wide open from above and below," said<br/>Carrot. "You can't think that your opponent is<br/>going to come right at you in the air." To<br/>demonstrate this point he swooped at her, curving<br/>and weaving in the air, almost coming down on top<br/>of her as he lashed out with a kick. "You can't<br/>defend a circle anymore Usagi. You've got to think<br/>in terms of a sphere. An enemy can attack from any<br/>position now, above, below. You don't have a plane<br/>like the ground, or limits like walls, to work<br/>with."<p>The girl took the hit, it was light and didn't<br/>hurt at all, but she saw his point. "So...what do<br/>I do?"<p>Carrot chuckled and stared at her for a<br/>moment. "Defend yourself, the only real way to<br/>learn, is by doing."<p>The girl's eyes went wide as he attacked, she<br/>desperately tried to block his strikes and counter<br/>them, but it was a losing battle. Luckily, he was<br/>being rather gentle with her, and she only<br/>received a few bruises from the assault.<p>Finally, he stopped and smirked at her. "Good<br/>job kid. Better than I thought, you've picked this<br/>up rather quickly."<p>Usagi was gasping and flying in a circle<br/>around him. She was trying to catch her breath,<br/>and doing a rather poor job of it as she gasped<br/>and swallowed repeatedly.<p>"You're not as fast as you could be,<br/>Katsutenshin Amaguriken is it?"<p>The girl nodded at this as she continued to<br/>circle him.<p>"Hmmm, you have been practicing it seems," he<br/>said with a smirk on his face. "Not bad for a<br/>newbie, kid."<p>The girl frowned at this and managed to start<br/>hovering again. "Hey! I..."<p>"Come on, we should land before Dan gets too<br/>impatient," said Carrot as he winked at her and<br/>started to dive downward.<p>He hit the ground lightly, and smirked as<br/>Usagi slammed into the dirt face first. She lay<br/>there for a moment looking dazed.<p>"Ouchie!"<p>"You've got to learn how to land kid," said<br/>Carrot calmly. He glanced around and sighed. "Come<br/>on Dan. I don't have all day."<p>"Teaching the kid a few tricks?" asked Dan as<br/>he stepped out from behind a wall and chuckled.<br/>"Never expected to find you out in the open."<p>"Have fun last night?" asked Carrot<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Loads," replied Dan.<p>"What was she like?" asked Carrot cheerfully.<p>Dan frowned at this and snorted. "None of your<br/>business."<p>"Hey! Don't be like that! I told you what<br/>Yohiko was like when you asked. Come on, be a<br/>pal!" said Carrot as he leaned on Dan's shoulder<br/>and smirked.<p>"What? Well, I guess so..." grumbled the man.<br/>"Never mind about that. You know why I'm here!"<p>"If you tell me, I'll give you the map," said<br/>Carrot as he grinned at the man. He held it out to<br/>the man and Dan simply looked at it.<p>"I...ummm..." said Dan as he looked at Carrot.<br/>"Heh. Okay."<p>"Great. Don't worry about her, she's still out<br/>cold from her landing. I guess I'm gonna have to<br/>teach her about that before China."<p>Dan shook his head and sighed. "I suppose so.<br/>Just keep her out of my way will ya?"<p>"No problem, we'll get our chance to fight<br/>soon enough," agreed Carrot. "Come on, I'll buy<br/>you a drink. You can tell me all about her." He<br/>pointed at a small cafe that was near to the site<br/>and started walking.<p>Dan shrugged and walked after him with his<br/>hands in his pockets.<p>After a moment the pair were sitting across<br/>from each other at one of the tables.<p>"Claws?" asked Carrot with a slight shudder.<p>"Yeah, my back is still sore. Man, don't they<br/>have something besides these girly tea things<br/>here?" He frowned at the menu and sighed. "Anyway,<br/>she does the cutest thing with her wings when<br/>she's embarrassed..."<p>"KAHH! What the hell are you doing?" screamed<br/>a familiar voice.<p>Dan and Carrot looked up to see Kiima floating<br/>above the ground, glaring at them both. "Huh?"<p>"Hey Hon! I'll have that map in a few<br/>minutes!" said Dan cheerfully.<p>"You're having tea with him?" snapped Kiima<br/>angrily. "What the hell are you two talking<br/>about!"<p>Carrot blinked. "Women. I told him about my<br/>girlfriend, it's only fair."<p>Kiima's face was a mask of rage as she landed<br/>next to Dan and slammed her fist into the back of<br/>his skull.<p>"Ouch!" muttered the man. "Come on! Don't be<br/>angry!"<p>Carrot shrugged, "Will you two quit hiding and<br/>just come out?"<p>Masara and Koruma both appeared with huge<br/>blushes on their faces. "You don't really make<br/>that noise do you Captain? I mean...he's<br/>never...ummm..." They both looked at Dan.<p>"What of it?" snorted the man as he glared at<br/>them.<p>"But, he's your pet landling!" cried Masara.<br/>"Captain! You didn't!"<p>"Who are you callin a landling?" snorted Dan<br/>irritably as his wings sprouted again. "Look you<br/>stupid punks..."<p>"Now, now! Calm down!" said Carrot as he put<br/>up his hands. "Come on Kiima, don't be mad. He<br/>really likes you!"<p>"You'd better have that map, Dan," snarled the<br/>woman.<p>"Actually, I told him I'd give it to him if he<br/>told me about you. We're pals, it's nothing to<br/>worry about. Don't be angry," said Carrot.<p>"What?" muttered Kiima as she looked at the<br/>man.<p>"Well, he did tell me about his girl..." said<br/>Dan sheepishly. "I mean, it's not like I was<br/>saying this out of the blue or anything."<p>"I wouldn't call her my 'girl' either," said<br/>Carrot with a small frown.<p>"Well you snore!" snapped Kiima.<p>"Yeah, tell me about it," agreed Carrot with a<br/>frown on his face.<p>"Hey!" snapped Dan.<p>Masara and Koruma had gone pale as they glared<br/>at the two men.<p>"We're roommates! It's not like that you<br/>perverts!" snapped Carrot as he glared at them.<p>"She makes these little whistling bird noises<br/>in her sleep," whispered Dan.<p>"How cute!" said Carrot cheerfully.<p>Kiima was beet red, she wasn't sure what was<br/>going on, or how she should react to this. "I'll<br/>kill them both!" she announced finally.<p>"If it'll make you feel any better, I'll let<br/>you tell me embarrassing things about him too,"<br/>offered Carrot.<p>"Yeah," agreed Masara and Koruma.<p>"You two! Get lost! This is a private matter!"<br/>snarled Kiima.<p>"Great, now she's mad at me!" said Dan<br/>irritably. "You did tell me to do whatever it<br/>takes to get the map, and this is what it takes."<p>Kiima blinked at this. "What?"<p>"Oh yeah, here ya go buddy. Ya know we're<br/>gonna be following you, I kinda have to lie about<br/>how you got this from me." Carrot winked at the<br/>man and handed him the map as he pat his shoulder.<p>"Oh, right. Thanks," said Dan cheerfully.<br/>"Here ya go hon, mission accomplished."<p>Kiima accepted it and simply stared at the<br/>pair for a moment, unsure of what to say or do.<br/>"I...Enough of this! Dan, come with me! We'll<br/>return home at last!"<p>"Right," agreed the man cheerfully. "See ya<br/>around, Carrot."<p>"Later man, we'll have to beat the hell outa<br/>each other next time!"<p>"Right, I look forward to it!"<p>Masara and Koruma rushed out after their<br/>master. "Wait! Captain! Wait for us!"<p>"Bye!" said Carrot as he waved at them as they<br/>vanished into the sky.<p>He sighed and walked over to where Usagi was<br/>sitting on the ground in the middle of the<br/>abandoned lot. She had a scowl on her face, and<br/>there were several craters on the ground now.<p>"Hey. Did you get it yet?" asked Carrot.<p>The girl looked at him and blinked, tears<br/>started to form in her eyes. "I can't land!"<p>"Oh, relax, it just takes a bit of practice.<br/>My first landing wasn't that great either. Carrot<br/>cocked his head and remembered the fight with<br/>Valdis during the Silver Millenium. "Really hurt<br/>too."<p>"Really?" said the girl with tears in her<br/>eyes.<p>"Yeah," said the boy cheerfully. "Come on, we<br/>should get back now. I'm sure your mother is<br/>worried, or something like that."<p>"Huh? What about that map?" asked the girl in<br/>confusion.<p>"Oh, yeah. Dan already showed up. You missed<br/>it. I lost the map, and he ran off with that bird<br/>chick. We gotta follow them to China now."<p>"WHAT!" cried Usagi.<p>"No big deal," said the boy as he shrugged.<br/>"Come on, we should go back. We gotta start packin<br/>and stuff."<p>"Oh man!" grumbled the girl as she hung her<br/>head and sighed.<p>"Cheer up! You get to go see China! It'll be<br/>an adventure and all," said Carrot as he grabbed<br/>her shoulder. "You'll love it there, it's very<br/>pretty."<p>"Oh, that's nice...I guess," muttered Usagi as<br/>she seemed to think about it for a moment.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"You lost map!" Plum grabbed the boy by<br/>his collar and shook him.<p>"Quit it! We'll just have to go get it, that's<br/>all," muttered Carrot irritably.<p>Plum released him and fell to the ground with<br/>a saddened look on her face. "Great. Is just<br/>great."<p>"We have to go to China?" said Ryoga with a<br/>frown on his face.<p>"Yeah, you're coming along too lost boy,"<br/>snorted Carrot. "We'll bring Usagi, Yohiko,<br/>myself, Ryoga, and Plum."<p>"What about Yusaku?" replied Usagi in<br/>confusion.<p>"What about him?" asked Carrot with a shrug.<br/>"He's not far enough along in his training to be<br/>of any real use. He'll just slow us down as he is<br/>now."<p>"He's right," agreed Yohiko reluctantly.<p>"What about these two idiots?" asked Usagi as<br/>she jerked her thumb back at Xellos and Phibrizzo.<p>"They'll be there getting under our skin<br/>whether we take them ourselves or not. I'd rather<br/>force them to make their own way there."<p>"Ouch," commented Xellos cheerfully.<p>"My family hates me it seems," agreed<br/>Phibrizzo.<p>"You'll get over it," commented Carrot.<p>"How can you be so mean to your own son!"<br/>cried Usagi in shock.<p>"Yes, tell us father?" said Phibrizzo<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Well, I don't treat my daughter much better,<br/>what are you complaining about anyway?" snorted<br/>Carrot as he looked at the boy.<p>"I'm not complaining, just agreeing with her,"<br/>said the boy cheerfully.<p>Usagi blinked. "Daughter?"<p>"Oops, not supposed to let that slip was I?"<br/>said Carrot cheerfully as he looked at Yohiko.<p>The woman stared at him blankly for a moment,<br/>after a few seconds it started to sink in. "You<br/>wouldn't."<p>"Already done," said Xellos with a small<br/>shrug. "What's the big deal, you've already got<br/>one love child. What's one more?"<p>"You've got a daughter too? What kind of<br/>pervert are you?" snapped Usagi angrily.<p>"Yeah, you," replied Carrot calmly as he<br/>scratched his ear and turned to look at her half<br/>way.<p>Usagi froze and stared at him for a moment.<br/>"What?"<p>Yohiko was looking at something on the floor<br/>that she suddenly found rather interesting.<p>"Well, isn't this interesting?" commented<br/>Xellos as he smirked at the pair.<p>"My father is dead!" snapped Usagi angrily as<br/>she stood up.<p>"No, your Dad is dead, your father is rather<br/>enjoying himself right now," said Xellos as he<br/>pointed at Carrot.<p>"What?" muttered the girl in confusion. She<br/>stared at her mother, not quite understanding what<br/>was going on still.<p>"Usagi, Keiichi wasn't your father...I just<br/>married him after you were..."<p>"I wasn't around, so she took the next best<br/>thing," finished Carrot calmly.<p>"Not around!" cried Usagi in shock.<p>"Why do you think I stayed away for so long?"<br/>snorted the man irritably. "Come back and find out<br/>some loser wimp married your wife, and was raising<br/>the daughter you never knew about as if she was<br/>his own? I was pissed."<p>Yohiko growled, "Why are you doing this to<br/>her?"<p>"Easier in the long run," said Carrot calmly.<br/>"Especially if we're stuck this way."<p>Usagi was simply looking at him with tears in<br/>her eyes.<p>"She is my daughter you know. I'm not lying to<br/>her," said Carrot calmly.<p>"Sometimes I hate the fact that she's more<br/>yours than mine," replied the woman as she turned<br/>her head away and refused to look at the girl.<br/>Carrot had based the girl after the male portion<br/>of them's real daughter, one she had no part of.<p>Usagi fell to her knees and stared at her<br/>mother for a moment. "It...it's true?"<p>The woman nodded slowly, not sure what else to<br/>say.<p>Plum and the two sorcerers hung back with<br/>Ryoga.<p>"What's going on here?" asked the lost boy.<p>"I'm not sure," replied Plum.<p>"Shhhh!" said Xellos as he munched on some<br/>popcorn with Phibrizzo next to him.<p>"Wow, this is like one of those soap opera<br/>things," said the boy.<p>"So, she is your sister?" asked Plum in<br/>confusion.<p>"Well, not really...but..." said Phibrizzo.<p>"Actually, she is your sister," said Xellos.<p>The boy looked at him and blinked. "Huh?"<p>"You should have known better than to open<br/>your mouth that way around them. It's how I got<br/>stuck here in the first place," said the man as he<br/>smirked at his companion.<p>"You mean?" muttered the boy dumbly.<p>"Uh huh," said Xellos cheerfully.<p>"Oh man, I bet they think this is hilarious,"<br/>grumbled Phibrizzo irritably.<p>"Of course they do," said Xellos cheerfully.<p>"Who is they?" asked Plum.<p>"It's complicated," said Xellos.<p>"Oh," muttered Ryoga as he looked at the<br/>ground in frustration. "So, you're my cousin too?"<p>"Apparently," said Phibrizzo with a small<br/>sigh.<p>"Well, we've all got a big day tomorrow. We're<br/>going to China," said Carrot as he jumped up out<br/>of his chair and smirked at them all. "This<br/>emotional family stuff can wait until later."<p>"What? You asshole!" cried Yohiko as she<br/>slammed her chair over the man's head.<p>"Ouch," grumbled Carrot.<p>"Daddy!" cried Usagi as she burst into tears<br/>and rushed into his chest.<p>"Hey! I said wait until..." He sighed and<br/>backed away. The girl was attached to his waist<br/>rather firmly. He sighed and slumped down into the<br/>recliner in front of the television. "All right,<br/>fine."<p>Yohiko snorted angrily, ready to pound him in<br/>the dirt again. She paused when she saw her<br/>daughter curling up in the man's lap, and the<br/>strange expression that flashed on his face for a<br/>moment. She wasn't quite sure what it was, but<br/>decided to leave them alone for the time being.<p>"So, we'll see you tomorrow then?" asked<br/>Xellos cheerfully.<p>"Ryoga, you stay here tonight," said Yohiko as<br/>she turned to look at the boy. "Plum can stay in<br/>Usagi's room."<p>"Right," said the boy as he looked at the<br/>woman for a moment and turned back to watching<br/>Usagi for a moment. "Is she?"<p>"She's fine," said Yohiko. "Don't worry about<br/>her."<p>Ryoga nodded and simply remained seated where<br/>he was.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"So, we go back to China?" said Dan as he<br/>looked out over the ocean with Kiima at his side.<br/>His head had several large lumps on it, and his<br/>face was covered in tiny scratches.<p>"Maybe next time you'll keep your mouth shut,"<br/>snorted the woman irritably.<p>"Hey, it was a one time thing," said Dan as he<br/>looked at her and sighed.<p>"So, what are we going to do with him<br/>Captain?" asked Masara.<p>"Yeah?" agreed Koruma.<p>"Take him with us of course," said Kiima.<p>Dan snorted as they looked at him warily.<br/>"How? I mean, he's too big to carry."<p>"I can fly to you half wits," snorted Dan as<br/>he promptly thwacked the pair with his wings.<br/>"These work fine."<p>"How dare you attack...!" started Masara.<p>"Leave him alone," snarled Kiima.<p>"Thanks," said Dan with a smirk on his face.<p>"He's one of our kind," responded Kiima<br/>flatly.<p>"I don't think he is," muttered Masara.<p>"He's got wings, that's enough," replied<br/>Kiima. "At any rate, it's none of your concern. He<br/>won't betray me, his loyalty is unquestioned."<p>"She's right about that," agreed Koruma.<p>"He's acting funny," snorted Masara. "I've<br/>never seen anyone..."<p>"I'm a special case, besides, I like being<br/>around. You'll have to beat me to get rid of me.<br/>Think you two losers can handle that?" Dan eyed<br/>them both coldly, and the pair backed off<br/>slightly. "Good."<p>"Quit squabbling and let's go!" snorted Kiima<br/>as she rose into the air.<p>Dan nodded and followed after her. "Come on<br/>losers, see if you can keep up."<p>The two birdmen growled and followed after<br/>him.<p>"Is that a challenge?" snapped Masara.<p>"Sounded like one to me!" agreed Koruma.<p>"Last one to China was a rotten egg!" replied<br/>Dan as he sped forward.<p>"No fair! You've got a head start!" snapped<br/>Masara.<p>++++++++++++<p>It was early morning and Carrot smirked as he<br/>followed the others to wards the train station.<br/>They were going to take the rail to the docks<br/>where Plum's boat was waiting for them.<p>"Hey, Just a minute," he said as he paused in<br/>the middle of the street. He turned away from them<br/>and jogged towards a familiar building.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ukyo blinked as a familiar face poked his head<br/>into the restaurant. "Huh?"<p>"Hey, Ucchan. We're going to China. Want a<br/>ride?" asked Carrot.<p>The girl stared at him for a moment, not sure<br/>what to say. "I uhhh..."<p>"If you're coming, hurry up. There's people<br/>waiting on me," said the boy cheerfully.<p>"Wha?" stammered Ukyo as she looked at him for<br/>a moment. "Um...okay. I gotta get my stuff and..."<p>"Great. We'll just stop and have breakfast<br/>while you pack. Don't forget anything."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Plum waved the group on board the small craft<br/>cheerfully. "Come on! The weather is just right<br/>for sailing!"<p>Ukyo stood on the dock looking at the boat<br/>that would carry them all to China. "Not much to<br/>look at is it?"<p>"I've seen worse, should do though," said<br/>Carrot with a shrug.<p>Usagi blinked. "It's kinda small."<p>"Beats swimming. That's how I had to get there<br/>last time," replied Carrot with a shrug.<p>"Yes," agreed Yohiko.<p>"You bet! Especially in such cold water.<br/>Brrr!" said Plum.<p>"You guys be careful. This thing is just wood,<br/>and I don't want to end up carrying anyone," said<br/>Carrot as he looked at the martial artist gathered<br/>on board.<p>"Why are you going to China anyway Ryoga?"<br/>asked Ukyo as she glared at the boy for a moment.<p>"I'm going to help my family," replied the boy<br/>as he looked at her in confusion.<p>"So, you're not going after Ranma?" she<br/>prodded.<p>"Stop that Ukyo, he's not going to bother<br/>Ranma," replied Yohiko. "My nephew is going to<br/>fulfill a family obligation."<p>The girl nodded and sighed. "So, this is your<br/>daughter?"<p>Usagi smiled at the girl. "Hiya! I'm Usagi<br/>Hibiki! You're one of my mother's students?"<p>"I hear you're not doing to well in school,"<br/>said Ukyo.<p>Usagi stopped speaking and simply froze. "I<br/>uhhh. Heh..."<p>"Oh, that's right," said Carrot as he put his<br/>pack on the ground. "I brought your school books<br/>with us. I figure you could use them. It's a long<br/>trip."<p>Usagi stared at the man for a long time.<br/>"You're kidding?"<p>"Nope, get to work," replied Carrot.<p>"Why are there two of you?" asked Ukyo as she<br/>looked at Carrot and Yohiko. It was obviously not<br/>the first time she'd asked that, and she was<br/>clearly suspicious.<p>"Long story, and it's complicated," said the<br/>boy with a small shrug.<p>"Plus, it's a secret," said Yohiko as she<br/>nodded towards Usagi and frowned.<p>"You'll explain this to me later though?"<br/>insisted the girl.<p>"If we get time, yes. Not with so many ears<br/>around," said Carrot as he frowned at her.<p>"Right," said the girl as she turned her head<br/>away and looked out over the ocean.<p>"This is going to be a long trip," said Ryoga<br/>with a small sigh.<p>"You have no idea," grumbled Usagi as she<br/>passed by him with an armload of books and tears<br/>in her eyes.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: China!
