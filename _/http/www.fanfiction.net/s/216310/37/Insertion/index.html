</div>Insertion<p>Part 37<p>An old friend<p>Ranma frowned as he stared at the remains of the wall beside him. "Hi Shampoo." He was walking towards the business district with his daughter beside him.<p>"Who the hell is this?" asked Chibi-Usa as she looked at the Amazon girl for a moment.<p>"Shampoo," said the Amazon as she peered at the girl intently. "Who you is?"<p>"My daughter, from the future," replied Ranma with a small shrug.<p>Shampoo blinked and looked up at him. "Is Shampoo's daughter?"<p>"Nope," replied the boy as he looked at her.<p>"Then not really daughter from future," said the girl with a small shrug. "Ranma come to take Shampoo to date?"<p>"No, we're meeting her mother," said Ranma as he nodded towards the little girl beside him.<p>"So, Airen go to date with other girl?" said Shampoo as she glared at the boy for a moment.<p>"It's none of your business if I do," he replied calmly.<p>"Shampoo stop you!" said the girl as she pulled out her bonbori.<p>"I can beat your great grandmother, what makes you think you could stop me?" he asked her as he arched his eyebrow at her.<p>Shampoo paused and stepped back. "Shampoo..."<p>"Well?" asked Ranma as he smirked at her and crossed his arms.<p>"Shampoo, has the son in law come to take you on a date?" said a familiar voice. Cologne hopped up to the pair and smiled at the boy for a moment.<p>"No. I'm taking my daughter to meet her mother," replied the boy calmly.<p>"Daughter?" asked the old woman as she peered at him for a moment. She turned her head to notice the little girl standing beside him. "This child is a little old to be yours my boy."<p>"She came back in time, from the future," he said with a shrug.<p>"Mom and Pop sent me back to stay with them when they were younger for a while," said the little pink haired girl as she looked at the mummy on a stick. "Man, you're ugly."<p>Cologne stared at the girl for a moment and then narrowed her eyes at the boy. "I see. Tell me, do you really think suck a simplistic ploy will derail us from catching you my boy?"<p>"No. I think you're stupid enough to try anyway," he said as she looked at her for a moment. "Can I go now?"<p>"Why don't you take Shampoo along?" asked Cologne. "I'm sure she'd like to meet her competition."<p>"Huh? Don't you mean kill her obstacle?" said the boy as he raised his eyebrow at the old woman. "She can come if she wants, but I'm not even dating her mother right now."<p>"Oh?" asked Cologne.<p>"Yeah, apparently it's something that happens in the future," he said with a small shrug. "I don't know what I see in that brainless, clumsy, Meatball head."<p>"Stop that!" snapped Chibi-Usa as she kicked him in his shins. "Even if it is true!"<p>"Ouch! You little brat!" snapped Ranma as he punched her in the top of her head.<p>"Ape!" snapped Chibi-Usa.<p>Cologne and Shampoo watched in stupefied shock as the pair started to fight in the street. Ranma was fighting with a little girl and apparently not pulling any punches as he hit her across her jaw and sent her crashing through a wall.<p>"What have you done boy?" snapped Cologne in horror.<p>He looked at her and blinked. "Huh? Don't worry, she can take it," he replied.<p>"How you do this to little girl!" snapped Shampoo in disgust. She was looked at the hole in the wall and started to move towards it to check on the girl.<p>"I wouldn't get to close if I were you," warned Ranma.<p>"Boy, it seems obvious that you're more dangerous than I had thought!" snapped Cologne. It was people like him who had forced the creation of Joketzuko.<p>"You stupid fucking ape! I'll kill you!" cried the little girl's voice from the other side of the wall.<p>Cologne paused and turned her head.<p>"You might want to move now," said Ranma as he smirked at Cologne.<p>"What?" snapped the old woman as she looked at him.<p>Shampoo peered through the collapsed wall for a moment. "Is all right?"<p>The young Amazon was thrown back by a powerful force of energy that exploded from the other side of the wall, crumbling it in an instant.<p>"What is this?" gasped Cologne as she saw the little girl floating in the air with an aura of energy surrounding her. The girl's hair was now gold, and she had a vicious looking snarl on her face.<p>"So, you think you can take me old man?" snapped Super Chibi-Usa as she grinned wildly and floated down to the ground in front of the shocked Amazon women.<p>Ranma smirked and spread his feet apart. "I told you to move old woman," he said as he glanced at Cologne for a moment.<p>The old woman hopped back several feet and stared at him. "There's no possible way!"<p>Ranma's power exploded, the golden energy swallowed his body and his hair changed as well. His body almost doubled in size from sheer muscle mass and he floated above the ground for a moment before landing as well as his own aura died down. "Ready for a little training kid?"<p>"Anytime you slow bastard!" snarled Chibi-Usa.<p>"Shampoo!" gasped Cologne as she moved up to her Great Granddaughter's side.<p>"Aiya! What this is?" said the girl in shock.<p>Chibi-Usa raised her hand and smirked. "Pink Sugar Heart Attack!"<p>Ranma blinked, "What the hell kinda stupid attack is..." He was cut off as dozens of six foot heart blades erupted from the ground beneath him with the points facing up, forcing him into the air. They tore up the pavement and vanished after the attack had been completed. "That was a nasty trick," he commented to himself.<p>"Come on old man! I don't have all day!" snarled the little girl as she slammed her fist into his gut hundreds of times.<p>"Ouch!" snapped the boy as he managed to catch her with a right hook across her jaw.<p>Cologne and Shampoo watched the battle in awe, or rather Cologne did. Shampoo couldn't even see the fight.<p>"This isn't possible!" snapped Cologne under her breath to herself. "His power...there's no way it's even...four times?"<p>"What happen? Where Airen go?" gasped Shampoo. She screeched in shock when one of the walls nearby exploded into a shower of debris. Ranma sat up from the rubble and glared up at the sky.<p>"You little brat! I'll get you for that!" he snapped.<p>"Anytime old man!" said Chibi-Usa from the air above them. She was making a face at her father by crossing her eyes, pulling at the corners of her mouth, and sticking her tongue out at him.<p>Ranma appeared in front of her and punched her dead in the face before she could stop making the face. "If you make faces like that, one day it will get stuck that way."<p>"Oth! I bid my dongue!" said the little girl as she held her mouth in pain. "Athhole!"<p>Ranma was laughing his ass off. "Serves you right!"<p>Chibi-Usa appeared in front of him and kneed him in the groin.<p>Ranma's eyes went wide and he curled into a fetal position. He coughed a few times and looked at the little girl who was smirking at him with her arms crossed. "Keep it up, and you'll never be born," he whispered harshly.<p>"Dang, he's right," she said with a frown as she suddenly realized that she could no longer hit him there, at least, not as hard as she just had.<p>Ranma's eyes narrowed and he waved his hand. A ball of chi rocketed from his palm and struck the little girl dead in her chest, driving her into the ground below.<p>Chibi-Usa climbed out of the hole and dusted herself off. "Dang, stupid old man..."<p>Cologne and Shampoo simply looked on, unable to move or speak.<p>"You two are still here?" said Chibi-Usa as she looked at them for a moment.<p>"How is doing this?" said Shampoo.<p>"It's hereditary," replied the girl with a small shrug. "Sorry, but I gotta kick my dad's ass now."<p>Cologne nodded very slowly as the girl blasted back into the sky.<p>A new voice rang out across the empty street. "Stop it right now!"<p>Ranma and Chibi-Usa froze, still locked in combat. "Uh-oh," they said in unison.<p>Everyone present turned to see Usagi glaring up at them from the street. "What do you think you're doing?"<p>"Kicking his sorry ass!" said Chibi-Usa sharply.<p>Ranma elbowed her in the gut and flashed her a quick glare. "Um. We were just training a little..."<p>"Yeah! That's right!" agreed the little girl with a guilty look on her face.<p>"Training?" muttered Cologne.<p>"Aiya!" exclaimed Shampoo.<p>"You call this training!" snapped Usagi as she pointed out the damage the pair had done.<p>"Well, kinda. We didn't make that hole," Ranma pointed out Shampoo's entrance and grinned. "That one is hers." He pointed towards the Amazon and grinned.<p>"Look at her! She's a mess!" cried Usagi as she fell to her knees in front of the little girl and grabbed her by her shoulders. "Why does she had blood coming out of her mouth?" exclaimed the girl in horror.<p>"I bit my tongue," said the little girl with a shrug. "It was an accident."<p>Usagi looked slightly relieved at this, but still glared at Ranma.<p>"Oh come on! I wasn't gonna hurt her! We were just sparring," he said as he glared at her.<p>"Sparring?" said Cologne dumbly.<p>"Now she's all dirty!" snapped Usagi.<p>Ranma's brain wracked, he had to think of something. "Um...the path of a true martial artist, is fraught with peril?"<p>"What the heck is that supposed to mean?" snapped Usagi.<p>"Is wife from future?" asked Shampoo as she looked at Usagi for a moment.<p>"Huh?" said Usagi as she looked up at the girl. "Ummm..."<p>"Yeah, so?" snorted Ranma.<p>"You told them?" gasped Usagi.<p>"These people are okay, relax. Besides, they don't know everything anyway," he said with a shrug. "Just that Chibi-Usa is my daughter from the future, and now that you're gonna be the mom."<p>"Great Grandmother?" asked Shampoo as she looked at the old woman for a moment.<p>Cologne looked thoughtful for a moment, and closed her eyes. She then nodded. "Do what you have to."<p>"Right!" said the girl with a firm look crossing her face. "Shampoo kill!"<p>Ranma looked at her with a sort of lazy frown. "If you do, I might be angry."<p>Cologne sighed, "Very well, Shampoo, stop."<p>The girl complied reluctantly.<p>Usagi merely watched the scene with an uncertain and confused look on her face. "Kill?"<p>"Obstacle is for killing," said Shampoo.<p>"Then I might decide your whole tribe is an obstacle," said Ranma as he looked at the two Amazons for a moment.<p>"What?" said Cologne.<p>"You heard me," he answered.<p>Usagi looked up at him and blushed as he stared the two women down. His aura died down suddenly and his hair turned black again. Chibi-Usa detransformed as well, growing slightly smaller, but not nearly as much as Ranma had.<p>"Come Shampoo. It's time we left," said the old woman as she hopped away.<p>"Okay," muttered the girl nervously.<p>"Man, that was pointless," snorted Ranma as he watched them go.<p>"Well, you don't look quite so dirty now," muttered Usagi as she looked the girl over again. It was too bad the dust the girl had accumulated on her clothes was easily visible on her black bodysuit. "I suppose he'll have to get you some new clothes."<p>"He?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"You got her dirty! Besides, you're rich! Take care of your daughter!" snapped the girl in retort.<p>"Yeah, suffer old man!" said the little girl as she stuck her tongue out at him again.<p>"I oughta..." he grumbled as he glared at her.<p>"You'll behave yourself!" snapped Usagi.<p>Ranma frowned at her, but didn't say anymore. "How's your boyfriend doing?"<p>"He's fine," she said curtly as she glared at him.<p>"Good, I hope you two keep getting along," he said as he looked at the little girl for a moment.<p>"Hey! What's that supposed to mean?" snapped Chibi-Usa as she glared at him.<p>"Nothing. Look, can we just do this?" he said grumpily as he started walking down the sidewalk.<p>"I guess so," said Usagi as she started walking with the pair. She noticed that the little girl was moving along beside him rather closely. "What's she doing?" she wondered to herself. She looked like she was deliberately avoiding touching him though, trying to look tough. It looked kind of funny on a girl her age.<p>She walked along side Ranma, and noticed that Chibi-Usa moved away from her to the other side of him.<p>Ranma noticed it as well. "What's with you?" he asked her out loud.<p>Usagi blinked and looked at him. She'd been wondering that, but didn't want to say anything to her.<p>"Mom'll probably try to hold my hand or something," snorted the little girl. "She's always doing stuff like that, telling me to be careful, making me hold her hand, always making guards follow me around when I'm out. It's stupid."<p>"Guards?" said Usagi in confusion.<p>"Yeah, guards," said the little girl as she glared at her mother for a moment. "I can take care of myself! I don't need no stupid guard! I can beat any of the Senshi! Cept maybe Saturn, and that's cause pop trained her!"<p>"You fight with Saturn?" asked Usagi as she looked at the little girl for a moment.<p>"Yeah! Me and her are like, best friends and stuff. We fight all the time!"<p>"Why do you fight with your friends?" gasped Usagi.<p>"Cause it's fun," replied the little girl cheerfully.<p>"What about you and Rei?" said Ranma as he looked at Usagi for a moment.<p>"That's...different..." she muttered with a small, embarrassed frown.<p>"Well, I guess I'll let you two alone for now," said Ranma as he shrugged his shoulders. He handed Usagi a thick roll of bills. "Have fun. Bring her back by the Dojo when you're done. I might not be there, but you can leave her. There's always someone there who can keep an eye on her. I got some work to do away from the house."<p>"Okay," said Usagi as she watched him wander away. "Wait!"<p>"Huh?" he said as he turned back to face her again.<p>"What's this for?" she said in confusion.<p>"Buy her some new clothes, take her to eat," he said with a shrug. "Keep the change."<p>"Oh," she said as she looked at it dumbly. The notes were in ten thousand-yen bills. "Wait!" she cried as he turned away again.<p>"Yeah?" he said with a slightly annoyed frown.<p>"Did you mean what you said back there? About, you know, hurting those people?"<p>"Well, I might have gotten angry," he said with a shrug. "Course, I might have decided I wanted a tuna sandwich too."<p>Usagi blinked. "What's that supposed to mean?"<p>"I dunno," he replied as he continued walking away.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma frowned as he looked down at the innards of the ship from the maintenance hatch with a bowl of food in his hands. "What the hell? Aw man I knew I forgot something..." he grumbled. He put down the bowl, closed the instruction book, and sighed as he walked off the ship.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma stood in the doorway of the Misaki shrine and glanced around. "Hello? Hey, old timer! You in here?" There was no answer, and he frowned. "Great."<p>"Well, I guess I've got to go ask Nephrite then," he muttered. He turned and was about to turn on his communications watch when something stopped him.<p>"Hold it right there!"<p>"Huh?" he said as he turned to see a tall blonde woman with a firearm pointed at him. She had a serious looking scowl on her face as she steadied herself.<p>"Most wanted first class criminal Ranma! You are under arrest!"<p>"Arrest?" he muttered dumbly. "What for?...hey! What do you mean 'Most wanted first class criminal'?"<p>"Wow," said Ryoko as she stepped out from behind the woman and whistled. "I knew I liked this guy for a reason."<p>Ayeka entered the room as well. "So, a Sith lord," she said to herself as she eyed the boy cautiously.<p>"Wha?" muttered Ranma, he now looked more confused than ever. "Look. I just wanted to ask old man Masaki something. If this is a bad time, I can come back later."<p>"I said hold it right there! I, Detective First Class Mihoshi, hereby arrest you in the name of the Galaxy Police!"<p>"Mihoshi huh? What am I under arrest for?"<p>"For the destruction of a planet in the Color system!" said the woman firmly.<p>Ranma blinked and looked at her for a moment. "Wait. You mean...that wasn't an inter-dimensional porthole?"<p>Mihoshi shook her head. "No, it wasn't."<p>"Well then, first of all, Galaxy Police has no jurisdiction here. Secondly, I was acting in defense of this planet, there was an invading army threatening my planet. Thirdly, I was under psychic attack, which negates all pretence of rational thought according to intergalactic law. And finally, you can't arrest me until you read me my rights."<p>Mihoshi blinked. She looked towards Ryoko and her eyes began to tear up. "I can't read you your rights. She...she...she broke my...WAAAAAAHHHHHHH!"<p>Ryoko merely smiled cheerfully at this and said nothing.<p>Yosho walked into the room with Tenchi and glanced around. "Hello. Oh, I see we have a visitor!"<p>"Hiya!" said Ranma as he waved at the old man.<p>"Well, what do you need my boy?" asked the old man as he walked between the teens.<p>"Well, I was making lunch inside my ship, while I was fixing it. I was hoping to borrow some soy sauce."<p>Everyone blinked.<p>"Of course, I'll get you some," replied Yosho as he wandered away.<p>"Thanks!" said Ranma.<p>"You're a Sith," said Ayeka as she glared at the boy for a moment.<p>"I am not!" he countered. "I am not a Jedi, you can't blame me for some stupid club some guys formed because I did something ten thousand years ago!"<p>Tenchi blinked. "Ten thousand years? You're that old?"<p>Ranma sighed. "No, time travel," he replied.<p>Tenchi seemed to relax a bit at this, but still looked nervous.<p>"Here you go," said Yosho as he entered the room and handed Ranma a bottle of Soy sauce.<p>"Thanks I'll bring the bottle back," replied the boy.<p>"No need," insisted Yosho.<p>"Thanks," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Wait! You say you have a ship!" said Mihoshi as she rushed up to him and grabbed him by his shoulders.<p>"Yeah," he answered.<p>"Could you...take me back home then?"<p>"What? So you can arrest me?" he replied.<p>"Well, it would be my duty of course," she replied.<p>"Oh. No then," he said as he turned away again.<p>"But..." she whined.<p>"Look, get those charges dropped, and then maybe I can take you home. Otherwise, I'm not leaving this rock for a while."<p>"See ya," said Ranma as he walked outside again.<p>"What a weird guy," said Ranma.<p>"I kind of like him," said Ryoko with a small shrug.<p>"You would," snorted Ayeka.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma finished his lunch and sat in the pilot's seat of the Mikon Taka. "Well, now or never." He began flipping switches, and the ship came to life. With a grin on his face, he turned on the engines and the ship rose into the air. "All right!"<p>"Where should we go?" asked Carrot.<p>"I dunno, it's fixed now. We could go to the moon, or maybe see how some of the other planets look after what happened after the Silver Millenium," said Ranma.<p>"I've got a better idea," said Carrot.<p>"Huh?" asked Ranma and Dan dumbly.<p>"There's been something bothering me ever since we got back. I wanna go check it out," said Carrot with an evil looking smirk.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma burst through the large double doors and glanced around. There was a trail of fallen security guards behind him.<p>"Sir! I couldn't stop him!" cried the butler who followed the boy into the room nervously. "The security force...it's..."<p>"Hiya!" said Ranma as he sat down at the desk of the man who was staring at him in horror. "I've come to talk with you about a few things."<p>"You!" cried George Lucas in horror.<p>"Yeah, I'd like to talk with you about a few of your movies. You know, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. About where you got the plots for those films from. I'm kind of curious..."<p>George screamed in terror and backed against the wall of the room, shaking visibly. "Get away!"<p>"Oh would you relax. I'm not gonna hurt you. Your guards just said I couldn't come in, and I'm really curious about how you managed to come so close to what I really did when I was in the past. It's been bugging me ever since I came back."<p>"He's come back! Come back to ruin my life again!" cried George in terror.<p>Ranma paused, there was something undeniably familiar about that terrified and hateful stare. "Wait a minute..."<p>"Get away from me!" cried George as he stumbled away from Ranma.<p>"Hanna?" muttered Ranma in shock. "Is that you?"<p>"God help me!" muttered George. "Why did you come back? Did you seek me out to torment me again demon!"<p>"Hey. Relax would you? I'm not going to do anything," said Ranma as he frowned at the cowering man.<p>"You're not?" muttered George.<p>"You were reborn as a guy?" said Ranma with a slightly sick look on his face. "Too bad, you weren't all that bad looking before."<p>"What do you want?" snapped George hatefully.<p>"Well, I was curious how you knew about all that stuff, to make your movies from. I guess I know now. This is weird," said Ranma. "You made me into Indiana Jones, and Luke Skywalker. I'm kinda flattered really."<p>"Actually, you were Belloque, and Darth Maul," snapped George bitterly.<p>Ranma sighed. "Right. I've got your old ship with me. You want to see it again?"<p>"My...ship?" muttered George.<p>"You know. Mikon Taka?" said the boy cheerfully.<p>"It's here? You mean...after all this time...I'm not crazy?" muttered George in shock.<p>"Naw," said Ranma. "Look. I've still got that mechanical arm." Ranma opened up the bottom of his forearm and showed the man the innards of his prosthetic limb.<p>"Of course! I was never crazy!" exclaimed George. "You're here? You're really here!"<p>"Yeah," said Ranma.<p>"This is great!" cried George. "Now I can kill you!"<p>"Huh?" said Ranma as he blinked.<p>George how had a rifle in his hands and was pointing it at him.<p>"Uh-oh," grumbled Ranma.<p>"This is for ruining my career!" cried George angrily as he fired at the boy. "This is for freezing me!" he fired again and Ranma dodged frantically.<p>"Hey! Stop that!" cried the boy.<p>"All this time! I thought I was nuts!" snarled George. "This is for all those years of therapy!"<p>"This guy really is nuts!" snapped Ranma as he dove through the window and flew back away from the building a little ways.<p>George jumped out after him, the office was only on the first floor of his mansion.<p>"Are you finished yet?" snapped Ranma.<p>George fired one more shot and blinked. "Out of ammo...I guess I am done then..."<p>"Great," muttered Ranma as he landed on the ground.<p>George's eyes went wide as he saw the Miko Taka sitting in his yard. "My old ship!"<p>"Yeah. Neat huh?" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"It does exist!" he muttered.<p>"Honey! I have to show my wife!" cried George as he jumped back into the window and tried to find his family. "Honey! Bring the kids, you have too..."<p>Ranma began to sweat nervously.<p>"Augh! What have you done!" cried the man as he saw his family lying passed out on the living room floor.<p>"Well, your wife thought I was some kind of mass murderer or something. She saw me beating up those guards you have around her. I only knocked her out cause she was protecting her family, but... she tried to bite me. I over reacted and accidentally caught your family in the blast. Don't worry, they aren't hurt. They'll wake up in an hour or so good as new."<p>George fell to his knees and looked down at them dumbly. "I..."<p>"Um. I'll just be going now," said Ranma as he quickly vacated the room.<p>George Lucas screamed in rage. It could be heard for miles around. Moments later, the Mikon Taka sailed through the air, on it's way back to Japan.<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Ranma vs. Ah!MG<p>
