</div>Insertion<p>Part 83<p>A year, and a day.<p>++++++++++++<p>Trunks, as he had dubbed himself,<br/>was slowly coming to a horrifying<br/>realization. Something far worse than<br/>even he had imagined had taken place. He<br/>was trapped in a room with Mihoshi, for<br/>an entire year. He thought he was taking<br/>it rather well.<p>"<br/>AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"<p>"Are you finished yet?" grumbled<br/>Hotaru as she frowned at her 'master'.<br/>"We should be training."<p>"Really? Why?" asked the bubbly<br/>blonde girl cheerfully as she smiled at<br/>her two companions.<p>"You're not supposed to be here,"<br/>said Hotaru as she frowned at her for a<br/>moment and turned back towards Trunks<br/>again. "I suppose you'll just have to<br/>wait over there." She pointed at the<br/>living area and sighed. "We have work to<br/>do."<p>Mihoshi shrugged at this and looked<br/>at Trunks. "Is he going to be all right?<br/>It sure is heavy in here though."<p>Trunks stopped screaming and looked<br/>at her for a moment. "Wait a minute!" He<br/>jumped to his feet and ran over to a<br/>small control pad that was on one of the<br/>walls in the living area. "A hundred<br/>times..." He blinked and looked over at<br/>Mihoshi for a moment and scowled. "What<br/>the hell?"<p>"What? Is something wrong?" said the<br/>blonde with a somewhat frightened<br/>looking frown. "I didn't break anything<br/>did I?"<p>"No, but...this room is set at a<br/>hundred times the gravity of Earth,"<br/>said the boy as he walked over to her<br/>and stopped. Looking her up and down he<br/>poked her leg. "How is she standing?"<p>"A hundred times?" said Hotaru as<br/>she looked down at herself. "Are you<br/>sure?"<p>"Yeah," replied Trunks calmly.<br/>"We're...well...come to think of it, I<br/>don't feel that heavy." He looked back<br/>at the pad again and sighed. "Oh, it's<br/>not turned on." He flicked the switch<br/>and immediately fell face first on the<br/>ground. Hotaru did much the same, but<br/>her fall was a little more controlled.<p>"Damn it!" she growled as she<br/>struggled to rise to her feet. With a<br/>grunt of effort she managed to squat,<br/>and noticed Trunks doing the same.<p>Mihoshi was standing there looking<br/>at them. "Are you two all right?"<p>Trunks and Hotaru blinked and stared<br/>at her as she walked over to the boy and<br/>leaned down to look him in the eyes.<p>"Okay, now this is getting weird,"<br/>he said as he turned towards Hotaru and<br/>grimaced.<p>"You could have killed her," growled<br/>Hotaru.<p>"What do you think I was trying to<br/>do?" he snorted irritably. "Well, maybe<br/>I was just hoping to keep her in once<br/>place for a while when we trained, but<br/>still."<p>Mihoshi was currently looking at a<br/>scale off in the corner. She was<br/>standing on it and peering down at the<br/>readout. "Waaaaahhh! I've gotten fat!"<p>"I don't believe this!" said Trunks<br/>in shock.<p>"You said we should ignore her,"<br/>said Hotaru calmly. "We've got our own<br/>problems to worry about. She transformed<br/>and Trunks glared at her.<p>"No, stop it right now," he snapped.<br/>"We aren't going to do it that way.<p>Hotaru had managed to straighten up<br/>and stared at him in confusion as she<br/>powered down and found herself leaning<br/>forward again in a low squat. "What do<br/>you mean?"<p>"We're going to transform like<br/>proper Saiyans," said Trunks with a low<br/>growling in his voice.<p>Mihoshi stood upright and blinked.<br/>"What?"<p>"Proper? What's wrong with doing it<br/>this way?" said Hotaru as she<br/>transformed again.<p>"I think we'll get more power, if we<br/>do it right," said Trunks calmly. "Even<br/>if we don't, we'll be stronger because<br/>of our training, and I think it'll lift<br/>some of the limits doing it the right<br/>way. Like being able to keep the<br/>transformation for extended periods of<br/>time."<p>Hotaru nodded at this and powered<br/>down again. "How do we do it?"<p>Mihoshi walked between them and<br/>stared at them both. She was oddly<br/>silent.<p>"What do you want? We're busy!"<br/>snapped Trunks.<p>The woman immediately burst into<br/>tears and grabbed them both around their<br/>necks. "WAAAAAAAAHHHHHH! I was so<br/>alone!"<p>Trunks and Hotaru gasped in complete<br/>and total shock as the woman's hair<br/>suddenly went jet black.<p>"No fucking way," said Trunks in a<br/>short of harsh whisper.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"What is this place?" muttered Usagi<br/>as she glanced around at her<br/>surroundings nervously. For the inside<br/>of a tree, it looked awfully high tech.<br/>The walls appeared to be metal until you<br/>got a very close look at them.<p>"Wow," muttered Ami with a little<br/>awe in her voice.<p>"Who is that guy? He's cute," said<br/>Minako as she eyed Yosho.<p>Makoto's head snapped around at her<br/>and she sighed. "I dunno, but he reminds<br/>me of my old sempai."<p>"Sure he does," grumbled Rei as she<br/>moved between them. "Where did that old<br/>man go?"<p>"Who cares!" gasped Minako as she<br/>moved up to the man's side and grabbed<br/>his arm. "Hi! I'm Minako!"<p>"I know," said the man with a<br/>slightly amused chuckle.<p>"Who are you? Are you a friend of<br/>Tenchi's? He seems to know you," said<br/>Makoto as she took up the position on<br/>his other side.<p>Yosho wasn't sure what to make of<br/>this. "I suppose you could say that."<p>"Grandpa really!" said Tenchi as he<br/>noticed the girls.<p>"Now Tenchi, I'm not as old as you<br/>thought I was," replied Yosho<br/>cheerfully. He smiled at the two young<br/>girls on his arms and continued to lead<br/>them through the halls. "It's been some<br/>time since I've seen this place. Perhaps<br/>I could give you a tour later, I know<br/>these halls very well."<p>The boy turned his head away and<br/>looked very uncomfortable.<p>"What do you think you two are<br/>doing?" snapped Ayeka as she took notice<br/>of the situation.<p>"Er...trying to get a date?" replied<br/>Minako as she stared at the girl.<p>"Get your hands off my brother!" she<br/>snapped as she shooed her away<br/>irritably.<p>Yosho chuckled and took the girl's<br/>arm. "Now Ayeka. These are our guests,<br/>we should treat them as such."<p>"What? Really brother!" snapped<br/>Ayeka. "You're old enough to be their<br/>great grandfather many times over!"<p>"Right, and you're not old enough to<br/>be Tenchi's grandma?" snorted Ryoko as<br/>she stuck her head in and leered at the<br/>princess.<p>"Who are you too talk you old bat!"<br/>snapped Ayeka in retort. She had a heavy<br/>blush on her face now though.<p>"Well, we're almost there," said<br/>Yosho as he glanced up at the towering<br/>ceiling of the great hall that led to<br/>the throne. To his surprise, the Emperor<br/>was standing in the hall waiting for<br/>them.<p>"You've got a lot of nerve coming<br/>here Yosho," he said coldly.<p>The man stood upright and frowned at<br/>him. "I have come, because of a great<br/>need."<p>"I'm sure you'll tell me all about<br/>it," commented the Emperor with a slight<br/>sneer. "However, it isn't the time for<br/>such things yet. Please, introduce me to<br/>these...people."<p>"Very well, this is Usagi, daughter<br/>of Queen Serenity of the Moon Kingdom,<br/>reborn on Earth once again, these girls<br/>are her protectors. They are the Senshi,<br/>reborn once again."<p>"Moon Kingdom?" snorted the man.<br/>"There had better be more to this than<br/>these girls Yosho."<p>"I'm afraid there is," replied Yosho<br/>calmly. "A great evil has descended upon<br/>Earth."<p>"What nonsense," snorted the Emperor<br/>as he started to turn away.<p>Luna jumped forward, Usagi almost<br/>cried out to her, but stopped suddenly<br/>when she spoke.<p>"It is not nonsense! I have seen<br/>this evil with my own eyes, and I wish I<br/>had never done so!"<p>The Emperor of Jurai simply stood<br/>there with his jaw hanging down as he<br/>stared down at Luna. After several<br/>moments, he finally spoke. "A...Moon<br/>Cat?" His eyes slowly moved to the group<br/>of girls standing nervously around the<br/>small creature. "So...it's true is it?<br/>Serenity succeeded. We had long ago<br/>given up hope of that."<p>The senshi all looked at one another<br/>and then back at the huge man who was<br/>now looming over them. "I'm not going to<br/>lie and say I'm glad to see you, but<br/>that colony was pretty much a failure<br/>anyway. Most of the inhabitants don't<br/>even remember their roots to this<br/>planet." He turned away from them and<br/>sighed deeply. "We will speak of this<br/>later, Yosho, you will take them to the<br/>guest quarters, and get a room for<br/>yourself there as well. We will speak of<br/>this tomorrow. I'm sure you're all<br/>tired."<p>Yosho nodded and turned towards the<br/>group. "Well, that went better than I<br/>thought it would."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Trunks growled as he stared at<br/>Mihoshi in more than pure irritation.<br/>This was positively impossible. "You<br/>don't know how to fight?"<p>"Fight? Well, I took self defense<br/>when I joined the Galaxy Police of<br/>course, but I..."<p>"How then?" muttered Hotaru as she<br/>stared at the woman's blonde hair. She<br/>had transformed again and was smiling at<br/>them cheerfully. It was almost as if she<br/>was having a tea party. Well, that was<br/>pretty much what they were doing<br/>actually.<p>"I'm not sure, when I was little, I<br/>found out my mom and dad died. I got<br/>really sad, and I changed somehow.<br/>Auntie said I looked really pretty with<br/>blonde hair, so I stayed that way."<p>"Auntie?" said Trunks in confusion.<p>"Yeah, she died a long time ago. We<br/>got some sort of message one day, the<br/>place we were from blew up. I found out<br/>later that Class A criminal Frieza had<br/>destroyed it. So I vowed I would become<br/>the best Galaxy Police detective ever,<br/>and bring him to justice!"<p>"Well, Frieza is dead," said Trunks<br/>with a slight smirk on his face. "He<br/>died trying to destroy Earth."<p>"Really?" said Mihoshi dumbly.<p>"Yeah, it was a while back<br/>actually," said Trunks as he scratched<br/>his chin.<p>"It was only about three weeks ago,"<br/>said Hotaru as she glanced at him for a<br/>moment. "I've been meaning to ask you.<br/>What is that ridiculous thing on the top<br/>of your head?"<p>Trunks blinked and looked up at his<br/>halo. Well, he tried to, but it moved<br/>out of his line of sight with the top of<br/>his head. "It's a halo, I got it when I<br/>came back from the dead. It's<br/>irritating, but it doesn't seem to get<br/>in the way or anything."<p>"Dead?" said Hotaru as she stared at<br/>him for a moment.<p>"Yeah, that was one messy episode,<br/>I'll tell you about it later, but only<br/>after we end this mess we're in now."<p>"Right," said Hotaru with a small<br/>sigh.<p>"What happened to your tail?" asked<br/>Trunks as he looked towards Mihoshi<br/>again. She looked slightly confused, but<br/>snapped out of it.<p>"Oh! That! Auntie had it removed,<br/>that's all," she said as she waved her<br/>hand.<p>"Great, so now what?" asked Hotaru.<p>"Now, we train," said Trunks with a<br/>small shrug. He glanced at Mihoshi and<br/>sighed. "You stay here. I'm afraid I<br/>don't have the time or patience to try<br/>and train you too." That was an<br/>understatement if he'd ever uttered one.<p>"She might be able to help us," said<br/>Hotaru as she glanced at him.<p>"Hotaru, you don't know Mihoshi very<br/>well, and trust me when I say, you don't<br/>want to even imagine what that would be<br/>like," replied the boy as he stood up<br/>and started to walk towards the void.<p>Mihoshi watched Hotaru follow with a<br/>cheerful smile on her face. This was<br/>turning out to be such a nice dream.<p>++++++++++++<p>George was standing on the Mikon Taka's<br/>roof, going over some minor repairs. He<br/>was still dressed in his spandex, and<br/>supervising several Juraian technicians.<p>Some of them wondered why they were<br/>bothering with something this old,<br/>others were wondering how the hell<br/>someone managed to get an unlicensed<br/>phase repulsor cannon onto such an old<br/>ship, a few of them even wondered how<br/>someone managed to rig the drive system<br/>to travel at over light speed travel.<br/>Every one of them was trying their best<br/>not to think about why the man was<br/>wearing a tight fitting female spandex<br/>uniform from about ten thousand years<br/>ago.<p>+++++++++++<p>"The pain of loss, you can use it to<br/>fuel the transformation," said Trunks as<br/>he looked at his student calmly and<br/>circled around her as she stared into<br/>the void.<p>"Pain of loss?" she muttered as she<br/>stared at the ground.<p>Trunks merely nodded and frowned.<br/>"It's difficult for me. I can't think of<br/>anything I've lost that will be enough.<br/>You however...you've got something you<br/>can use. Something fresh in your mind."<p>The girl's face contorted slightly<br/>and she gasped. "No...please..."<p>"You must," he replied<br/>emotionlessly.<p>"I...I can't," muttered the voice<br/>that obviously belonged to Hotaru.<p>"Do you want revenge?" he asked her<br/>coldly.<p>"Yes." The reply was instantaneous.<p>"Then you must transform, Chibi-Usa<br/>is stronger than the both of us, even<br/>with our transformations. We've got to<br/>match her, and go beyond that. This is<br/>the only way."<p>"I'm...not ready," said Saturn's<br/>steely calm as she clenched her fist<br/>against her chest and frowned.<p>Trunks nodded at this, he trusted<br/>her judgement. "All right, but we've<br/>still got a lot of work to do." He<br/>charged at her and attacked.<p>+++++++++++<p>A few days later, Mihoshi watched<br/>the pair battle from the safety of the<br/>living area of the room. She sighed and<br/>looked around in confusion. "This sure<br/>is a long dream."<p>She sat for almost an hour on the<br/>steps that led into the void, staring<br/>aimlessly. There weren't even any clouds<br/>to look for pictures in, or any chores<br/>to do. Well, there was dinner, but that<br/>would have to wait a few more hours.<br/>Oddly enough, it still got dark at<br/>night, even in the nothingness.<p>Finally, after hours of<br/>contemplation, she figured out exactly<br/>what was wrong. "I'm cold." She stood up<br/>and looked at the two specks in the<br/>distance. Occasionally, a flash of light<br/>could be seen, but they mostly ignored<br/>her. She was starting to get lonely<br/>really, but they did listen to how her<br/>day went at dinner. She'd tell them<br/>about how she cleaned, and cooked, and<br/>daydreamed as they ate. Their grunts of<br/>irritation seen as agreement as she<br/>rambled<p>Abruptly her bubble headed train of<br/>thought stopped again and she remembered<br/>that she was cold. "Hmmm. Do we have any<br/>extra blankets, or a heater or<br/>something?" she muttered as she glanced<br/>around. Finally her eyes fell on<br/>something in the wall, next to the<br/>strange door she couldn't open. "Hey! A<br/>thermostat!"<p>Immediately she walked over and<br/>started to press buttons. "Let's see,<br/>how do I work this thing?" The readout<br/>changed suddenly, adding an extra zero<br/>to the digital one hundred. "No, that'll<br/>be too hot..." she muttered. Before she<br/>could try to correct her mistake, she<br/>slammed onto the ground.<p>"Ouchie!"<p>Two tiny cursing voices could be<br/>heard in the distance.<p>++++++++++<p>"Master. Let's kill her," said<br/>Hotaru as she struggled to push herself<br/>off the ground.<p>"If we do, Tenchi might be upset,<br/>we're probably going to need his help,"<br/>grunted Trunks in the same position.<br/>Their clothes were torn and scorch marks<br/>could be seen along the ground, the only<br/>indication that there was a level plain<br/>that separated the sky from the ground.<p>"I can't take this!" growled Hotaru<br/>irritably.<p>"Screw it! When we make it back,<br/>she's dead!" growled Trunks as his head<br/>hit the ground again.<p>"Thank you master!" cried Hotaru.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>A week later...<p>"Huff, huff...We made it!" cried<br/>Trunks triumphantly as he stumbled onto<br/>the stairs of the living area and fell<br/>face first onto the ground.<p>"Food!" cried Hotaru with tears in<br/>her eyes.<p>"Oh! There you are!" cried Mihoshi<br/>as she cheerfully bounced over to where<br/>they were and squatted down beside them.<br/>"I don't know why, but everything got<br/>really heavy the other day. It's been<br/>very hard to clean up around here!<br/>Sorry, but your dinner got cold, it's in<br/>the refrigerator if you want it. I kept<br/>trying to turn up that thermostat, but I<br/>think it's broken. It's not any warmer."<p>Trunks's eyes wandered over to the<br/>readout on the wall and he almost<br/>choked. "FIVE THOUSAND! YOU'VE GOT THE<br/>GRAVITY UP TO FIVE THOUSAND! YOU<br/>BUBBLEHEADED IDIOT! THAT'S NOT A<br/>THERMOSTAT!"<p>"Huh? It isn't?" said the blonde<br/>obliviously. She appeared to be moving<br/>about without much trouble.<p>"I'd kill her now, but I'm<br/>starving," grumbled Hotaru.<p>"Right, food first, killing later,"<br/>muttered Trunks as he struggled to his<br/>feet and walked over to the<br/>refrigerator.<p>After that, they immediately fell<br/>asleep. Thus saving Mihoshi from a<br/>rather painful death.<p>++++++++++++<p>Trunks glared into the mirror that<br/>night and frowned. "You warped my halo!"<br/>he muttered as he glanced irritably back<br/>at Mihoshi. She was sleeping, and his<br/>golden ring was now looked somewhat like<br/>a golden 'U' from the side. He had just<br/>woken up, and they were moving around<br/>without too much trouble now. Mihoshi<br/>had gradually turned the gravity up over<br/>the course of the week. He had forbid<br/>her to touch it again, but the damage<br/>was already done. It was the maximum<br/>setting anyway. "Now we have to keep it<br/>like this," he grumbled irritably as he<br/>tried to pick up a glass of tea, only to<br/>have the liquid promptly fall through<br/>the bottom of the glass and into his<br/>lap. "I hate her, I hate her so much,"<br/>he muttered to himself as he sat there<br/>and stared at the wet spot on his lap<br/>for a moment. They had to be careful<br/>even pouring liquids now. Hotaru had<br/>found that out the other day. She had<br/>tried to pour herself a cup of tea, only<br/>to have it break not only the bottom of<br/>the cup, but also the table and a good<br/>portion of the floor.<p>Naturally, he'd played it off as<br/>good training, but it still got on his<br/>nerves. The woman was downright<br/>insufferable. The only think keeping her<br/>alive was the fact that he wasn't sure<br/>how the Juraians would react to him<br/>killing her. He really didn't need to<br/>fight his way off the planet. One screw<br/>up like that was enough.<p>"What else can go wrong?"<p>Mihoshi walked up to him with a<br/>cheerful smile on her face as she sat<br/>down at the table. "I didn't feel like<br/>cooking tonight, I hope you understand."<br/>She looked somewhat sleepy and had just<br/>returned from doing something. He hadn't<br/>even seen her get up in his musings.<p>He stared at the boxes sitting in<br/>front of them and blinked. "What's<br/>this."<p>"I ordered a Pizza," she said<br/>cheerfully.<p>"We don't have a phone," said Trunks<br/>as he turned to look at her.<p>"Oh, I know. This is carry out,"<br/>said the blonde cheerfully.<p>His eyes turned to look at the<br/>impossible. The boxes sitting on the<br/>table. "What the fuck? That's<br/>impossible!"<p>"What do you mean?" said Mihoshi<br/>dumbly. "It's kind of funny, but Washuu<br/>said the same thing when I saw her."<p>Trunks hit his head on the table. It<br/>went right through it, and it was rather<br/>painful. "I'm not even going to ask how<br/>you did this."<p>"Silly, I just went to that little<br/>place outside the palace. Ayeka told me<br/>about it. They make good Pizza she<br/>said," replied the blonde as she smiled<br/>at him.<p>"Washuu huh?" said Trunks as he<br/>stared at her.<p>"Yes, she was angry, but she's<br/>always like that. I think she was in her<br/>lab, but I'm not sure..."<p>Trunks sighed and opened the box.<br/>Sure enough, there was a steaming hot<br/>pie sitting inside. "Whatever."<p>"Where is Hotaru?" asked Mihoshi as<br/>she glanced around.<p>"Huh? Oh, she went off by herself<br/>for a little while," said the boy as he<br/>took a slice and started eating. "She'll<br/>be back in a while."<p>"I'd hate for her food to get cold,"<br/>said Mihoshi with a worried looking<br/>frown.<p>"I guess, I'll go get her in a<br/>minute," said the boy with a shrug. His<br/>face scrunched up slightly and he looked<br/>at Mihoshi. "You got any relatives named<br/>Hibiki?"<p>"No. Why?" asked Mihoshi after a<br/>moment of thought.<p>"It's nothing," said Trunks as he<br/>brushed it off.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Hotaru glared into the nothing, her<br/>heart racing as she strained against her<br/>feelings and the pent up rage inside her<br/>heart. "I feel it!" screamed the<br/>youngest voice in her mind in triumph.<br/>"Almost..."<p>Nine and Saturn were silent,<br/>allowing the young girl to come into the<br/>power as best they could. They were<br/>currently feeling the changes that were<br/>struggling to come forward in their<br/>body. "Almost..."<p>"What is this power?" muttered Nine<br/>in a sort of awed whisper.<p>"Quiet," snapped Saturn. It was<br/>almost an aside, and obviously she<br/>hadn't been paying attention. Hotaru had<br/>her complete attention.<p>The golden power formed around them,<br/>changes coming faster and faster. They<br/>could feel their hair rising away from<br/>their scalp slowly. It flashed with gold<br/>for a moment as they struggled to keep<br/>the power from escaping their grasp yet<br/>again.<p>Hotaru screamed, a final surge of<br/>effort, the last of her mental strength<br/>pulling at the new power. All then knew<br/>after that, was an explosion of light.<p>"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"<p>Gasping they stared down at<br/>themselves. Their body was noticeably<br/>bulkier, more-so than their previous<br/>transformation had done to them. "I feel<br/>it, it is different," muttered Hotaru to<br/>herself as she stared down at their<br/>body. They were a Super Saiyan.<p>"Such power!" muttered Mistress Nine<br/>in awe. "It's mine..."<p>"Don't get ahead of yourself," said<br/>Saturn coldly.<p>"No...it's..." Hotaru lost it, the<br/>power faded and she grit her teeth in<br/>frustration. "It's gone."<p>They turned their heads and noticed<br/>something. Trunks was standing a short<br/>distance away, clapping his hands. "Well<br/>done."<p>"M-master," said the girl as she<br/>blushed slightly. "I didn't see you."<p>"I'm just glad I didn't miss that,"<br/>said Trunks with a small shrug.<p>"I couldn't hold it," grumbled the<br/>girl as she frowned again.<br/>"It's...difficult."<p>"I know, we'll work on it some more<br/>later. Hopefully, I'll be able to figure<br/>out how you did it a little better by<br/>observing," he said with a small sigh.<p>Hotaru nodded at this and turned her<br/>head away. She had always respected him,<br/>but somehow he seemed to have lost some<br/>of it somehow. She wasn't sure why, or<br/>how. For some reason, Hotaru didn't care<br/>if he approved or not. It was almost<br/>resentment, but not quite that bad.<p>"Come on, Mihoshi had pizza for us,"<br/>said Trunks as he smirked at her for a<br/>moment. He could see it. She was<br/>confused, angry, and something was gone<br/>in her eyes now. "You hate me?"<p>Hotaru blinked. "What? No master,<br/>I..."<p>"I see," he said with a chuckle.<br/>"Hotaru, I'm sorry I made you do that.<br/>Maybe one day you'll forgive me, maybe<br/>not."<p>"What? What is it?" said the girl as<br/>she looked at him.<p>"Maybe it's that I'm younger than<br/>you now? Maybe it's being stuck in a<br/>room with me for a year? Or maybe, it's<br/>that I forced you to use your father's<br/>death to gain the power you have now?"<br/>He noticed her flinch slightly on the<br/>last one and his smirk fell. "That's it<br/>is it?"<p>The girl flashed a glare at him and<br/>he sighed. "I'm sorry Hotaru, but we<br/>have to be ready." He turned away and<br/>started walking back.<p>"Pizza?" muttered the girl to<br/>herself as she forced the thoughts out<br/>of her head.<p>"Yeah. Don't ask," said Trunks as he<br/>glanced back at her again.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Two weeks later...<p>It was amazing, the feeling he had<br/>just had was beyond anything he'd ever<br/>experienced. Well, not really. Becoming<br/>the ruler of the Universe will jade you<br/>a little. It was still more than he was<br/>expecting. The power faded just as<br/>quickly as it had come and he fell to<br/>his knees. Gasping for breath he took<br/>Hotaru's extended arm and allowed her to<br/>help him to his feet. "I've got it."<br/>He'd just had his first real Super<br/>Saiyan transformation. "Man, what a<br/>rush."<p>"Isn't it though?" asked Hotaru with<br/>a somewhat playful tone. She'd changed<br/>quite a bit over the past two weeks. She<br/>hadn't heard the word 'master' since the<br/>day she had transformed. It seemed she<br/>believed herself to be the superior one<br/>here, or at least on equal footing.<p>Trunks smirked at this as he stared<br/>her down for a moment, challenging her<br/>gaze coolly. "I'll have to correct that<br/>after I get the hang of this."<p>"What?" said the girl as she blinked<br/>at him.<p>"It's nothing, just thinking out<br/>loud," he replied as he glanced away.<br/>"It's about time to eat. We should get<br/>back."<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Mihoshi wasn't a terrible cook, but<br/>she wasn't a good one either.<br/>Occasionally, she would disappear for a<br/>minute or two and come back with take<br/>out of one sort or another. Neither<br/>Trunks nor Hotaru questioned this,<br/>although they did try to find a way to<br/>seal her out while she was gone. Any<br/>attempts were unsuccessful, and she<br/>always returned. Neither of them had<br/>ever seen her come or go. It was damned<br/>irritating. The pair were fearful that<br/>they'd have to eat her cooking all the<br/>time if they told her that it was<br/>impossible to escape the room.<p>If she got it in her head that she<br/>really was trapped, she might lose the<br/>odd ability to leave. Trunks was in<br/>favor of the theory of a reality bending<br/>stupidity field. Hotaru was thinking<br/>more along the lines of dumb luck along<br/>with a teleportation ability. In any<br/>case, neither said anything to Mihoshi.<br/>After all, she might get stuck outside<br/>if someone on that end explained it to<br/>her. It was an off chance, but the pair<br/>was hoping.<p>As it was, things remained pretty<br/>much the same. They were nearing the<br/>halfway mark on their training, and the<br/>year would be over.<p>"We need to start practicing in the<br/>air again," said Trunks as he glanced at<br/>Hotaru. "We've got the transformation<br/>down now."<p>Hotaru nodded, secure in the<br/>knowledge that she had it down a week<br/>earlier. "So I get to kick your butt in<br/>the air now?"<p>Trunks smirked at this. "You can<br/>try, I'm going to stop holding back<br/>now."<p>Hotaru's smile flickered for the<br/>faintest of moments. Trunks pretended<br/>not to notice as best he could. His grin<br/>widened a bit despite his efforts.<p>"Fly?" asked Mihoshi.<p>"Yeah, fly," said Trunks lazily.<p>"You have a ship?" she muttered in<br/>confusion as she glanced around.<p>"No, we don't need a ship to fly,"<br/>said Hotaru with a slightly irritated<br/>frown.<p>"Um, an anti-gravity pack?"<p>"No?"<p>"Really bouncy shoes?" asked<br/>Mihoshi.<p>"No. We take our energy, and push<br/>ourselves into the air," said Trunks.<p>"Really? That seems hard," said<br/>Mihoshi with a small frown.<p>"Not really. We just take it, make<br/>it into a little ball like this," said<br/>Trunks as he smiled and formed a chi<br/>ball into his hand. "But instead of<br/>doing it in our hands, we do it in<br/>here." He pointed at his stomach and<br/>grinned. "Then you just will it to move<br/>you. Pretty simple really."<p>"Oh," said the woman obliviously.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Trunks was supremely annoyed, not<br/>because Hotaru was actually doing better<br/>than he'd thought. He was still beating<br/>her rather soundly. This irritated her,<br/>but it was slight. Not by the fact that<br/>it was hard to tell how far from the<br/>ground they were. They had several<br/>landing accidents because of this.<br/>Certainly not by the fact that it was<br/>difficult for either of them to hold the<br/>transformation for more than about two<br/>hours. They still had almost four years<br/>worth of training to go through still if<br/>they needed it that badly. No, Trunks<br/>was annoyed, by Mihoshi.<p>"Wheeeeeeeeeee!" cried the blonde as<br/>she twisted between himself and Hotaru<br/>cheerfully. She was fluttering around<br/>like a sparrow, flapping her arms in a<br/>ridiculous manner and giggling as she<br/>flew around the room.<p>The most annoying thing of all, was<br/>the fact that he'd told her how to do<br/>it, and he'd told her how to do it not<br/>even an hour ago.<p>"Damn."<p>"You just had to open your damn<br/>mouth didn't you?" growled Hotaru<br/>irritably as she glared at him.<p>"I didn't think she'd really figure<br/>it out all right?" he snapped angrily.<p>"Hee hee! This is so much fun!"<br/>cried Mihoshi as she flipped around them<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Stop that!" cried Hotaru as the<br/>woman spun circles around her and<br/>twisted higher and higher into the air.<p>"Don't you think this is great? It's<br/>the best dream ever!" cried Mihoshi as<br/>she maneuvered up beside them and<br/>continued to flap her arms.<p>"You don't have to do that!" snapped<br/>Trunks as he grabbed the offending<br/>appendages and held them down firmly.<p>"Oh? Really? Good, I was getting<br/>tired," said Mihoshi cheerfully.<p>Hotaru slammed her foot right into<br/>his jaw and growled at him. "Idiot! Why<br/>did you tell her that?"<p>"This sucks more and more, every<br/>day," growled Trunks from the ground.<p>Mihoshi giggled at the scene and<br/>merrily went about flying around them<br/>like an annoying fly. Hotaru started to<br/>try her best to play flyswatter, but the<br/>woman was irritatingly hard to hit with<br/>her random fluttering. "Hold still damn<br/>you! Just die!" cried the enraged girl.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Three Months Later...<p>"What's this?" muttered Hotaru as<br/>she glared at the machine in front of<br/>her.<p>"Practice," said Trunks as he turned<br/>it on.<p>"It's a video game," said Hotaru.<p>"I know, we have to practice<br/>dancing," said Trunks calmly as he<br/>stepped back from the machine and<br/>sighed. "If we screw up the fusion<br/>dance, it makes us weaker instead of<br/>stronger. We have to make sure we're in<br/>perfect harmony when we do it. It was<br/>blind luck that we got it right last<br/>time."<p>The machine cheerfully barked at<br/>them, startling Hotaru slightly. "Are<br/>you ready! It's time to dance!"<p>"We should get this over with,"<br/>grumbled Trunks as he sighed and started<br/>messing around with the menus. He<br/>pointed to the pad that extended from<br/>the bottom of the machine and Hotaru<br/>nodded and stepped up onto it with him.<p>With a sick looking grimace, Trunks<br/>pushed started the game.<p>"Ai-yai-yai, I'm your little<br/>butterfly, red, black, and green, like<br/>the colors in the sky..."<p>Hotaru blinked and looked at him.<p>"Yeah, I know, but I couldn't think<br/>of a better idea," he said with a small<br/>shrug.<p>"Dance Dance Revolution?" muttered<br/>the girl as she read the title out loud.<p>"Come on, I wanna get this over<br/>with," said Trunks with a small sigh.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Mihoshi was addicted, it was all<br/>they could do to keep her away from the<br/>damn machine. Hotaru had tried to<br/>destroy it, but it merely got stuck on<br/>one song.<p>The bubbly blonde had become<br/>protective of the game now, she wouldn't<br/>let them near it. She was surprisingly<br/>successful in steering any attempts to<br/>destroy it away. Thus, "I'm a Little<br/>Butterfly, now echoed through eternity<br/>of the room."<p>"Damn," growled Hotaru as she glared<br/>at the machine in the distance.<p>"Damn that woman and her stupid dumb<br/>luck!" growled Trunks angrily at her<br/>side. They had tried everything, even<br/>blasting it from a distance with huge<br/>chi blasts. Everything had been<br/>deflected, repelled, or otherwise<br/>thwarted by nothing more than sheer<br/>stupid luck.<p>Once a sudden growth of ice had<br/>stopped it. Hotaru and Trunks had spent<br/>the better part of an hour trying to<br/>fight their way through it without<br/>becoming encased. Another time, a flash<br/>flood had saved the now raged and barely<br/>operable machine, washing away the<br/>ground based chi attack and sending it<br/>into a portion of the living area. Yet<br/>another attempt at merely using brute<br/>force had actually been thwarted by<br/>Mihoshi. The woman actually managed to<br/>grab them both in a pleading hug, a hug<br/>that took them an hour and a half to<br/>break free from.<p>"This is stupid!" snapped Hotaru.<p>"I know, but we've tried everything<br/>else," growled Trunks.<p>"Fine, ready?"<p>"Not even Mihoshi can stop us if<br/>we're fused!" agreed Trunks.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Um, who are you?" muttered Mihoshi<br/>as she stared at the red-haired child in<br/>front of her.<p>The child was unfortunately about<br/>four feet wide, with pudgy cheeks and no<br/>neck. "Shut up."<p>"Are you lost little girl...well, I<br/>suppose you're not really little then<br/>are you? Can I help you find your mommy?<br/>There aren't a lot of people here, so it<br/>shouldn't be too hard."<p>"Shut up." growled Fat Turtaru.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Wow grandma, you must really be<br/>hungry. I mean, you're all skin and<br/>bones!" said Mihoshi as she spoon fed<br/>the old woman sitting in front of her.<p>"Slt urp," said the skinny, flimsy<br/>looking old Turtaru through her spoonful<br/>of force fed applesauce.<p>"You shouldn't be wandering around<br/>like this! I'm sure your family is<br/>worried about you! Of course, I said the<br/>same thing to that little girl who<br/>stopped by earlier today. I hope she's<br/>all right! I mean, I told her 'don't you<br/>wander off now!' and she just up and<br/>disappeared on me! I do hope she made it<br/>home all right. I mean..."<p>Old Turtaru growled hatefully at the<br/>woman and tried her best to block out<br/>the song that still echoed across the<br/>empty space in the room. She twitched<br/>slightly, her neck going into an<br/>unexplainable spasm.<p>"Oh, you like this song too? It's my<br/>favorite! There were a lot of other<br/>one's too, but this one is the best.<br/>It's too bad it only plays this one now,<br/>I'm not sure why..."<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"It's over, I'm finished, I'm just<br/>going to lay here and die," said Trunks<br/>as he looked at Hotaru. The both of them<br/>were merely lying on their backs,<br/>listening to the music drift across the<br/>void. "She's...defeated us."<p>"I can't concentrate! We can't fuse<br/>while that racket is..." muttered Hotaru<br/>lamely. "Beaten by that woman...I'll<br/>never live this down!"<p>"If you don't tell, I won't," said<br/>Trunks weakly. "Who am I kidding? We're<br/>going to die here!"<p>There was a loud crash, followed by<br/>an explosion, and then...silence.<p>"What?" muttered Trunks as he sat<br/>upright suddenly. "What was that?"<p>Hotaru cocked her head on the<br/>ground, not daring to move. She was<br/>hoping in vain that she had somehow gone<br/>deaf. Then she realized that she'd heard<br/>Trunks speaking to her.<br/>"It's...stopped?"<p>Mihoshi's high pitched voice started<br/>wailing in sorrow.<p>"It's the most beautiful sound I've<br/>ever heard!" cried Trunks in triumph.<p>Mihoshi walked by them a short time<br/>later, carrying her beloved game in her<br/>arms like a child. "It...it's...it's<br/>broken! WAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!"<p>The seemingly indestructible<br/>machine, had finally succumbed to the<br/>intense gravity of the room, and<br/>Mihoshi's bodyweight as she played yet<br/>another game on the machine. She had<br/>somehow put her foot right through it,<br/>and destroyed the power source. At long<br/>last, the nightmare was over.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Trutaru sweat as she lowered her<br/>hands and stared at the wall of ice that<br/>had now completely shattered away into<br/>thousands of broken and melting shards.<p>"We've got it," she said with a grin<br/>of triumph on her face as she clenched<br/>her fist and smirked. "At last."<p>In an instant, the transformation<br/>ended. Hotaru and Trunks stood next to<br/>one another and gasped for a moment as<br/>they readjusted to their own bodies.<p>"Still only half an hour," muttered<br/>Hotaru.<p>"I don't think there's a way to<br/>extend it," said Trunks as he nodded at<br/>her.<p>"So, what now?" said the girl as she<br/>stood upright and frowned. "Wanna spar<br/>again?"<p>"I would, but..." Trunks smirked at<br/>her and stared forward. "Our time is up.<br/>We need to get ready to go back."<p>The girl turned to look at him and<br/>smiled slightly. "It's over?"<p>"It'll be one year, in about an hour<br/>and half," said Trunks with a small nod.<p>"I lost track of time around the<br/>time..."<p>"Don't say it! We will never speak<br/>of that horrible machine again," said<br/>Trunks curtly.<p>Hotaru nodded in agreement.<p>++++++++++++<p>Mihoshi sighed and looked around at<br/>her surroundings. "You know, this is the<br/>longest dream I've ever had."<p>The door that she'd never been able<br/>to unlock suddenly opened behind her and<br/>she blinked. "Hey..." Curiosity set in<br/>and she stood up and walked over to it.<br/>"I wonder where this goes?"<p>"Outside, we're leaving," said<br/>Trunks calmly as he stepped up behind<br/>her and put his foot in the doorway<br/>before she could close it behind her. It<br/>nearly broke his foot and he cursed<br/>under his breath after it happened, but<br/>it was preferable to staying in the room<br/>for another year.<p>"That was close," muttered Hotaru as<br/>she stepped outside.<p>Trunks was the last to leave, he<br/>stepped out and glanced around. They<br/>were standing on the launch pad again,<br/>with the Mikon Taka looming overhead.<br/>George was standing on top, ordering<br/>around workers in his tights.<p>"Come on! We haven't got all day!"<br/>he cried irritably as he started welding<br/>something on the roof.<p>"I'm surprise they have parts for<br/>this sort of thing here," commented<br/>Trunks as he noticed the workers.<p>"Well, they don't use space trees to<br/>travel around on planet," said Washuu as<br/>she walked up next to them.<p>Trunks whirled around and grabbed<br/>her collar roughly, pulling her up to<br/>face him. He growled angrily and stared<br/>her dead in the eyes. "YOU!"<p>"What's the problem?" muttered<br/>Washuu nervously.<p>"You did this!"<p>"What do you mean?" muttered Washuu<br/>as she smiled at him, the sweat on her<br/>brow was not a good sign in her favor.<p>"Washuu, you owe me more than you'll<br/>ever know," he growled angrily.<p>"Owe you? What do you mean owe you?<br/>She got out! I still haven't figured out<br/>how she was able to break into my own<br/>time chamber! I should have<br/>increased..." Washuu realized that she<br/>had said exactly the wrong thing. "I<br/>mean, we haven't seen her all day. We<br/>were getting worried!"<p>"I just spent an entire year, locked<br/>in a room with Mihoshi," said Trunks<br/>angrily as he touched her nose against<br/>his own. "Now, if you ever do anything<br/>like that to me again. I will kill you."<p>The redhead nodded very slowly. "I<br/>umm..."<p>"Don't say anything!" he snapped at<br/>her as he dropped her to the ground.<br/>"Just don't speak! You owe me Washuu,<br/>you owe me big. Just remember that."<p>She nodded sheepishly and backed<br/>away slightly as Hotaru walked by and<br/>gave her the evil eye.<p>"Heh. Oops," she said as she stood<br/>up and dusted herself off.<p>++++++++++++<p>Trunks was drunk. It was a great<br/>feeling to be free at last, finally out<br/>and away from the horrors of the time<br/>chamber. He was feeling quite satisfied<br/>with himself and downed another pint of<br/>Juraian Beer. He thought it was rather<br/>odd that the entire planet only had one<br/>label, but it wasn't a bad label either.<p>Idly he reached out with his hand,<br/>and another bottle floated into his<br/>grasp. He burped casually and flicked<br/>the cap off with his thumb in a quick<br/>motion. It flipped into the air and<br/>landed in a glass with several others.<br/>Oddly enough, he had a rather large area<br/>of clearance around him.<p>He looked around and noticed several<br/>of the Juraians were watching him rather<br/>closely. His clothes were rather ragged,<br/>but he had good money, and as far as he<br/>knew, there was now drinking laws on the<br/>planet. Something to do with the alcohol<br/>having non addictive qualities due to<br/>the 'Water of Life' or something. It was<br/>a memory of Genaku's from the Silver<br/>Millenium anyway.<p>Hotaru had gone off on her own,<br/>looking for peace and quiet. They would<br/>spend a day outside the chamber, and<br/>then return with Ryoko with them. This<br/>time, the blonde terror would not be<br/>with them.<p>As it was, they had a lot of work to<br/>do once they entered. Ryoko would have<br/>to be taught how to access her power as<br/>well. She had at least started, but<br/>didn't quite have a handle on it yet.<p>Then came the part he was dreading<br/>the most. Training with the Senshi,<br/>luckily he had something different in<br/>mind for them. That was still in the<br/>planning stages anyway. Washuu said it<br/>would be at least three days before they<br/>were ready for that anyway.<p>He grinned to himself as he<br/>staggered to his feet, not noticing the<br/>cloaked figures following close behind<br/>him.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"What do you think?" asked one of<br/>the men who followed behind Trunks with<br/>his hood pulled down over his head.<p>One of the others nodded slowly,<br/>pulling his own hood back to reveal a<br/>rather young looking man with short cut<br/>hair. "We must inform the master."<p>"Perhaps it would be best to just<br/>bring him to the master," said the<br/>third member of the group. He pulled his<br/>hood away to reveal dark skin and a bald<br/>head. "He just fell asleep in the<br/>street."<p>The others nodded in agreement and<br/>shuffled over to where Trunks was lying<br/>on the ground.<p>++++++++++=<p>He woke up several minutes later<br/>after being shoved onto his feet rather<br/>gently. His finger was sore and there<br/>was some muttering going on around him.<br/>Something to do with 'Midi-chlorians' or<br/>something like that. "Wha? Where?"<p>"Ahhh, this is the one? Seeks<br/>training he does?" said an irritatingly<br/>familiar voice.<p>"Yoda?" muttered Trunks as his<br/>vision cleared slightly.<p>"Yes," said the tiny green man in<br/>front of him. He was wrinkled and old,<br/>with long ears.<p>"What the hell is this? Where am I?"<br/>he muttered.<p>"Tested he shall be," said Yoda with<br/>a grave muttering noise following the<br/>statement.<p>Trunks realized that he was in some<br/>sort of room, surrounded by men in dark<br/>shadowy cloaks and hoods. All of them<br/>had their hoods off and were sitting in<br/>a rather relaxed manner. Behind them a<br/>large panoramic window revealed the<br/>surface of Jurai.<p>"I thought the Jedi council was on<br/>Coruscant."<p>"Hmmm, lucky you are, that<br/>vacationing at summer home we are," said<br/>Yoda gravely.<p>"Whatever," muttered Trunks in<br/>annoyance. This was starting to become a<br/>major buzz-kill.<p>"Begin the trials we shall," said<br/>Yoda.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Hotaru poked her head into Ryoko's<br/>room and frowned. The woman was pouting<br/>angrily, and muttering something about<br/>'sharing rooms is inappropriate my ass',<br/>and 'Tenchi wouldn't mind if I...'. All<br/>at once Ryoko noticed her and scowled<br/>openly. "What?"<p>"Have you seen Trunks around lately?<br/>I can't find him," she said with a<br/>little amusement in her tone.<p>"What the heck do I care about that<br/>brat for? Go find your boyfriend<br/>yourself," she snapped irritably as she<br/>phased through one of the walls.<p>Hotaru clicked her tongue and shook<br/>her head. "I'll have to remember that<br/>one when it's time to train you Ryoko."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"How feel you?"<p>"Huh? I dunno, about ninety-eight<br/>degrees, soft, smooth texture, kinda<br/>oily," said Trunks as he rubbed on his<br/>arm for a moment.<p>"Oily?" said Yoda in a sort of<br/>muttering fashion. It was as if he<br/>understood some greater meaning in that<br/>statement.<p>"Yeah, I kinda need a bath," said<br/>Trunks with a small shrug.<p>"Hmmm..." said Yoda as he peered at<br/>the boy.<p>The boy peered right back, his eyes<br/>slightly bloodshot. He almost fell as he<br/>leaned forward to peer the old alien<br/>right in the eyes and staggered for a<br/>moment before regaining his footing and<br/>continuing to stare.<p>"Hmmm. I sense much beer in this<br/>one," said Yoda wisely.<p>+++++++++++++<p>A short time later...<p>"Cup," said Trunks as he rolled his<br/>eyes.<p>The bald man was looking at some<br/>sort of electronic screen that randomly<br/>flashed pictures. It would stop, and<br/>Trunks would have to tell him what it<br/>was. He had gotten them all right up to<br/>this point. It was unnerving all of<br/>those present a little.<p>The man shifted in his seat and<br/>looked at the boy uncomfortably. "This<br/>one?"<p>"I dunno, you moved," replied<br/>Trunks.<p>"I moved?" said the man as he stared<br/>at the boy in confusion.<p>"Yeah, I can't see the reflection of<br/>the screen in the window behind you<br/>anymore," replied the boy with a shrug.<br/>"What did you think I was doing?" He<br/>stared at the man.<p>"I ummm..." he coughed into his hand<br/>and shifted in his seat again.<p>"Oh, it's a speeder! Are we done<br/>now?" said Trunks cheerfully. "I'm gonna<br/>have a mega-hangover later. I kinda<br/>wanna get to bed before it starts."<p>"The boy is gifted," said the bald<br/>man to Yoda.<p>"Hmmm. Indeed," said Yoda. "Clouded<br/>his future is though..."<p>"So what?" grumbled Trunks<br/>indignantly.<p>"So, can he be trained?" asked one<br/>of the other jedi.<p>"Trained? By you losers?" said<br/>Trunks as he looked around. He burst<br/>into laughter and started rolling on the<br/>floor.<p>The jedi were absolutely perplexed.<p>"Hmmm?" said Yoda as his ears perked<br/>up.<p>"Jeez, what kind of jerk do you<br/>think I am? I go back in time and kill<br/>some idiot in oversized armor with a<br/>magic crystal, and you dolts start some<br/>sort of fan club. You expect me to join?<br/>Ha! I've got more power in my pinky than<br/>the whole lot of you combined!"<p>One of the jedi jumped out of his<br/>seat. "What? He speaks of..."<p>"Yes, the legend," said Yoda<br/>ominously. "Mocks us he does."<p>"What are you gonna do about it?"<br/>snorted Trunks as a small opening in his<br/>arm appeared. A thin metal rod appeared<br/>in his grasp and he frowned at the men<br/>surrounding him. "I'll kick your ass old<br/>man!"<p>The jedi were on their feet with<br/>their weapons drawn in an instant. No<br/>one had ignited their blades yet though.<p>"Jedi, how pathetic," snorted Trunks<br/>as he glanced around.<p>"A Sith?" cried the young Jedi who<br/>had helped bring him.<p>"Don't be stupid. I wouldn't waste<br/>my time with one of those losers<br/>either," snorted Trunks indignantly.<p>"The Force is strong with this one<br/>master, be cautious," said the young<br/>jedi to Yoda.<p>"Hmmm, see that I can," said the old<br/>man carefully.<p>"Bah, the force my ass," snorted<br/>Trunks. "I'm no jedi, and I never will<br/>be. I'm a Saiyan Warrior, the strongest<br/>in the Universe! You're not even a warm<br/>up!"<p>The Jedi gasped, blades came to life<br/>all around Trunks, but he stood calmly<br/>as if nothing had happened.<p>Yoda held up a clawed hand and<br/>narrowed his eyes at the boy. "Speaks<br/>the truth he does."<p>"About what?" said the bald one with<br/>a hint of panic in his voice.<p>"Stronger than all of us he is not,<br/>but a Saiyan he is," replied Yoda<br/>coolly. "Many years it has been, since<br/>one of your kind have I seen."<p>"Yeah, we had a little problem a<br/>while back, but we got better. Besides,<br/>I'm not an ordinary Saiyan. I'm a Super<br/>Saiyan, you can't see my real power old<br/>man. At least, not yet."<p>Yoda narrowed his eyes at some of<br/>the angrier looking Jedi. "A lie, that<br/>was not. From this one, no deceit do I<br/>sense."<p>"He could be blocking it out," said<br/>the bald Jedi.<p>"Come and find out," challenged<br/>Trunks playfully. He beckoned with his<br/>hand and waited. No one took his<br/>challenge. Finally, he slumped down and<br/>sat on the floor. "Man, you old farts<br/>are no fun at all. You're just standing<br/>there."<p>"I am wondering, who you are?" said<br/>Yoda calmly.<p>"I wasn't expecting the bloody Jedi<br/>Inquisition," grumbled Trunks.<p>"Nobody expects the Jedi<br/>Inquisition!" snapped the young jedi.<p>"Hmmm, I sense anger," commented<br/>Yoda. "The Dark Side has two chief<br/>weapons, fear leads to anger, anger<br/>leads to...The Dark Side has three chief<br/>weapons, fear leads to anger, anger<br/>leads to hate, hate leads to...the dark<br/>side has four, four chief weapons, fear<br/>leads to anger, anger leads to hate,<br/>hate leads to suffering!" said Yoda<br/>wisely.<p>"Yeah, great. Can I go now? I mean,<br/>it's obvious you guys don't want to<br/>fight and all...this is pretty boring,"<br/>commented Trunks.<p>"One more question do I have," said<br/>Yoda calmly.<p>"What is it old man?" snorted<br/>Trunks.<p>"I am wondering, why you are here?"<br/>said the old Jedi calmly.<p>"Hmmm? I'm going to save the Earth<br/>of course, but first I gotta train a<br/>little, and I'm afraid none of you old<br/>geezers would do me any good in that.<br/>I'm just too far beyond you."<p>"Arrogant he is," commented Yoda. He<br/>frowned suddenly and looked thoughtful.<br/>"Five, five chief weapons of the Dark<br/>Side! Arrogance leads to..."<p>"Oh shut up," snorted the bald jedi<br/>irritably.<p>Yoda looked slightly miffed for a<br/>moment before becoming serious. Once he<br/>was sure Trunks was out of earshot he<br/>sighed heavily. "So, he is indeed the<br/>one."<p>"It would seem that way," said the<br/>bald jedi with a short nod.<p>"What should we do?" asked one of<br/>the jedi sitting near the end of the<br/>room.<p>"Nothing...but watch closely we<br/>should," said Yoda calmly.<p>"Is he as powerful as he claims?"<br/>asked the young jedi.<p>"Indeed," said Yoda with a short<br/>nod. "Explains much it does, on why so<br/>much about Valdis was found, nothing<br/>about the founder."<p>"If he's a Saiyan..." said one of<br/>the angrier looking Jedi.<p>"A Saiyan he is, but more than that<br/>he is also," said Yoda. "Smart he is,<br/>dangerous, but not evil." He nodded to<br/>himself and sighed again.<p>"What should we do?" insisted the<br/>young jedi.<p>"Nothing, can we do," said Yoda with<br/>a small shrug. He pulled out a small<br/>pipe and lit it before relaxing<br/>slightly. With a small sigh he exhaled<br/>some of the smoke and closed his eyes.<br/>"His own destiny he must find, clouded<br/>his future is..."<p>The bald jedi nodded. "Only because<br/>he controls his destiny more than most."<p>Yoda opened his eyes and chuckled,<br/>it was a wheezing sort of sound. "Ooh!<br/>Saw that to did you? Yes, dangerous he<br/>is, but also...hope he represents, to<br/>himself, and others."<p>The young jedi looked frustrated at<br/>this, but turned to look at the hallway<br/>where Trunks had gone. "I don't<br/>understand master."<p>"Perhaps, one day, you will," said<br/>the bald jedi calmly.<p>"I bet you don't either," snorted<br/>the young jedi in irritation.<p>The bald jedi frowned at him. "I<br/>do."<p>"Oh yeah? Explain it then!" snorted<br/>the young jedi.<p>"You must find your own answers,"<br/>replied the bald man with a small smirk<br/>on his face.<p>"You're only saying that cause you<br/>don't know," snorted the young jedi.<p>The man's smirk fell again and he<br/>shook his head. The young jedi snorted<br/>and walked out of the room calmly with a<br/>smirk of his own this time.<p>"Right he was," said Yoda quietly.<p>"Nobody asked you," growled the bald<br/>man.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Ryoko's training!
