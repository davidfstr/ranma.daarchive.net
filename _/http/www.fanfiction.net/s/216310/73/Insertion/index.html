</div>Insertion<p>Part 73<p>Jusenkyo's Secret!<p>+++++++++++++<p>Usagi stared at her cousin and her mother in a<br/>sort of happy wonder. They were getting along so<br/>well, it was almost scary.<p>Of course, the fact that Carrot, Dan, Yusaku,<br/>Xellos, and the man everyone now knew as Nephrite<br/>were now in the room with their new guest didn't<br/>hurt either.<p>"What's up with this?" asked Dan irritably.<p>"Yeah, I'm sure of it! I hadn't even thought<br/>about it until now," agreed Carrot as they all<br/>looked at Nephrite.<p>The man was simply looking at them in<br/>confusion. He appeared to be no more than twelve<br/>years old as he was now. He also had a sort of<br/>innocent smile on his face.<p>"Well..." said Xellos cheerfully.<p>"You shut up, we aren't asking you," snorted<br/>Carrot.<p>The man wisely kept his mouth shut and sat<br/>back in his chair after this.<p>"Why the hell are you Phibrizzo anyway? You<br/>were Gaav when we left," said Carrot irritably.<p>"What they is talking about?" asked Plum as<br/>she leaned in towards Usagi.<p>The older girl looked down at her and<br/>shrugged. "Got me, must be some more backwards<br/>sorcerer stuff."<p>"Sorcerer?" muttered Plum dumbly.<p>"Yeah, something like that. Don't worry, he's<br/>my uncle, and they're both okay guys," whispered<br/>the girl cheerfully.<p>Nephrite finally got around to answering.<br/>"Well, It's like this. We found out about this<br/>'Slayers' thing. Naturally, Zocite and Kunzite<br/>didn't like the idea of one of them betraying the<br/>other and becoming rouge. I offered to switch<br/>around with him, and you agreed. That's all."<p>"Oh, well, you idiots do realize that that's<br/>just a manga right?" asked Dan with a small frown.<p>"We didn't want to take any chances with you<br/>around," snorted Xellos calmly. He was looking<br/>directly at Carrot as he said this.<p>"Oh, right," said Carrot with a small shrug. "On<br/>to other business!"<p>"Why am I here? What's going on? What's all<br/>this stuff about Phibritso and stuff?" muttered<br/>Yusaku in confusion. "Someone please explain<br/>what's going on!"<p>The smaller Mazoku chuckled. "Well, for<br/>starters, Phibrizzo is my name."<p>"Oh, Who are you?" asked Yusaku.<p>"I'm Yohiko's love child with Carrot!"<br/>announced the boy proudly.<p>Everyone fell face first onto the table.<p>"WHAT!" screamed Yohiko. "You little..."<p>"I have a brother?" gasped Usagi.<p>"Does that make him my cousin?" asked Ryoga<br/>fearfully.<p>"Don't worry, not much danger of you sleeping<br/>with this one," replied Dan.<p>"I thought we were gonna keep this a secret!<br/>You weren't supposed to say anything!" snapped<br/>Carrot as he grabbed Phibrizzo by his collar and<br/>shook him. His face was a mask of fake anger.<p>"It's not true!" screamed Yohiko.<p>"Say it isn't so!" wailed Yusaku.<p>Xellos chuckled as he felt the shift in<br/>reality fade again. He wondered just how long it<br/>would be until L-sama stopped laughing after he<br/>told them that Phibrizzo really was their love<br/>child now.<p>"I'll kill him!" screamed Yohiko as she<br/>attempted to dive across the table and grab the<br/>boy's neck.<p>"Calm down," said Carrot as he held her back.<p>"WAAAAHHH! Rejected by my own mother! Oh the<br/>shame!" cried Nephrite cheerfully. He was really<br/>trying not to smile, but it was more than he could<br/>handle.<p>"Everyone BE QUIET!" screamed Plum at the top<br/>of her lungs.<p>The whole room turned to look at her.<p>The girl slammed her palm down on the table<br/>and an old looking sheet of paper was slapped<br/>across the surface. She sighed and looked at them<br/>all for a moment. "I brought this map with me. Dad<br/>always called it, "Jusenkyo's secret". If this map<br/>falls into their hands, then the Spring of Drowned<br/>Man, The spring of Drowned Girl, all the springs<br/>at Jusenkyo will dry up!"<p>"WHAT?" cried Ryoga in horror.<p>"Tough luck kid," said Carrot as he pat the<br/>boy on his back and smiled at him.<p>"We've gotta do something!" cried Ryoga.<p>"What the heck is Jusenkyo?" asked Usagi<br/>lamely.<p>"The Training Ground of Cursed Springs," said<br/>Yohiko calmly.<p>"Yes, very tragic story!" agreed Plum.<p>"So, you're that old guide's runt?" snorted<br/>Dan indifferently. "Didn't figure him for the<br/>marrying type."<p>"In any case, this is interesting. Problem is,<br/>I don't see any reason not to just give this map<br/>to them," said Carrot with a small shrug.<p>Plum blinked. "What you is saying? No more<br/>cure for Jusenkyo curses anymore!"<p>"Well, Ryoga is keeping his as punishment for<br/>what he did to Usagi," said Carrot calmly.<p>The boy froze up and made a choking sound.<p>"Other than that, I say we make a deal. A few<br/>flasks of Jusenkyo's drowned girl and man springs<br/>in exchange for the map. After that, no more<br/>curses. You won't need a cure."<p>"No more job for family either!" snapped Plum.<p>"You'll just have to find other work. As it<br/>is, you're living off the suffering of others,"<br/>said Yohiko with a small snort. "Besides, what<br/>about all those Jusenkyo Springs Mail Order<br/>Products?"<p>Plum frowned and clutched the map to her<br/>chest.<p>"What's all this about curses?" muttered<br/>Yusaku dumbly.<p>"Don't worry about it, Ryoga is the only one<br/>here with a problem," replied Carrot with a small<br/>shrug. "In any case, these Phoenix people are<br/>mostly harmless right? Other than being extremely<br/>territorial that is."<p>"No," replied Xellos calmly. "It's much worse<br/>than that."<p>Everyone looked at him in surprise. "There<br/>hasn't been a Phoenix King in a thousand years. If<br/>Lord Saffron completes his transformation, things<br/>will go very badly for the people in that area. It<br/>will seriously cripple China, and possibly go as<br/>far as engulfing the entire world in a war. A war<br/>against someone who is very nearly immortal, and<br/>immune to any weapon that uses heat to destroy."<p>Carrot narrowed his eyes at this. "What do you<br/>mean?"<p>"Nukes won't kill him," supplied Dan calmly.<br/>"Radiation might though, just not the blast<br/>itself."<p>"There's more to a nuclear explosion than heat<br/>ya know," grumbled Carrot.<p>"Still, there is a high probability that he<br/>will survive unharmed, and possibly not be<br/>effected by the radiation fall out that would<br/>occur either," said Xellos with a sort of dark<br/>foreboding in his tone.<p>"So what? Now we just go and cream the bastard<br/>then right? He's just a kid now," snorted Carrot.<p>"Allow me," said Xellos cheerfully. He waved<br/>his hand and an image appeared in front of them on<br/>the table. It was little more than old looking<br/>drawings depicting his story, but Yusaku almost<br/>fell out of his chair when he saw it.<p>"The Bayankala Mountain Range, in the Quinghai<br/>region of China. To the south of Mount Kensei,<br/>which holds Jusenkyo, stands Mount Phoenix. At the<br/>summit of Mount Phoenix, is a poll as cursed as<br/>the pools of Jusenkyo are cursed." Xellos smirked<br/>at the bored expression on the three adult's faces<br/>and showed them images of these places. "According<br/>to the ancient lore, the pool at the summit of<br/>Mount Phoenix was cursed, when one of the many<br/>birds surrounding the peak fell in and drowned."<p>"Hence, the bird people that live there," said<br/>Carrot with a small nod. "The three of us have<br/>heard all this before."<p>"We have?" asked Yohiko.<p>"Well, Dan and I have at any rate," commented<br/>Carrot with a shrug. "No big thing."<p>"What is talking? You know why they're trying<br/>to destroy Jusenkyo?" asked Plum in confusion.<p>"Yeah, they want to raise some Phoenix God<br/>named Saffron. It has something to do with that,"<br/>said Carrot calmly.<p>"How...do you know all this?" asked Usagi in<br/>confusion.<p>"Various adventures in the past, I've been to<br/>Jusenkyo myself actually," replied Yohiko. "It's<br/>nothing to worry about."<p>"Oh, okay," said Usagi in confusion.<p>Yusaku was simply staring at the scene. He had<br/>no clue about any of this. He jumped to his feet<br/>and frowned. "You there! Come on out!"<p>Carrot turned and chuckled at the trio that<br/>now stood in the window. "Well, what have we<br/>here?"<p>Dan turned as well and blinked. "Whoa, what a<br/>babe!"<p>"Yeah, you said it," agreed Carrot as they<br/>both stared at the winged woman who had entered<br/>with her two male lackeys at her side.<p>"Um? What?" asked Usagi as she turned to stare<br/>at them. "I guess she is kinda pretty..."<p>"What? I'm not good enough?" snarled Yohiko as<br/>she put Carrot into a headlock.<p>"What? You don't like me anyway!" snapped the<br/>man in retort.<p>"You bastard! How dare you cheat on my auntie<br/>right in front of her!" cried Ryoga angrily.<p>"We have to actually be dating for me to cheat<br/>on her! We just fooled around a bit!" cried<br/>Carrot.<p>"Enemy to all women!" screamed Yusaku angrily<br/>as he stood beside Ryoga and started to stalk<br/>towards Carrot.<p>"I...um..." said the bird woman dumbly. "Um,<br/>hello..."<p>"What should we do?" asked Usagi as she pulled<br/>on Dan's sleeve.<p>"Do what you want, I'm gonna check out the<br/>babe," said Dan as he pointed at the newcomers.<p>Kiima was starting go grow red with anger.<br/>"What the hell is this?"<p>"Please! Stop fighting! We must defeat evil<br/>monsters! Save Jusenkyo remember?"<p>"Sure," said Carrot as he jumped over Ryoga<br/>and Yusaku and kicked them both in the back of<br/>their heads. The pair slammed into the wall and<br/>slumped down. Neither one of them was out though,<br/>they simply sat there rubbing their foreheads in<br/>irritation. "Anything if I get to see more of her.<br/>Bet she can fight too, my kinda woman!"<p>"Shut up!" screamed Kiima.<p>"Won't work, she already did that," said<br/>Carrot as he pointed at Plum. Both he and Dan were<br/>standing on either side of her, with her two<br/>lackeys easily kicked out of the way.<p>"What?" she muttered in confusion. "Why are<br/>you? Enough of this! Give me that..."<p>"Great move, now she's mad at us," grumbled<br/>Dan.<p>"Hey, ain't like you had a better idea,"<br/>snorted Carrot irritably.<p>"Enough!" snapped Kiima as she slapped them<br/>both.<p>The men blinked at her and then looked at each<br/>other.<p>Finally, Dan sighed and turned around. "Okay,<br/>everyone turn around and pay attention while the<br/>pretty bird lady tells us who she is and threatens<br/>us!"<p>Everyone immediately did so.<p>Kiima blinked at this. "Um...thank you."<p>"Sure thing," said Dan as he winked at her and<br/>stepped aside with Carrot so that she could pose<br/>with her lackeys. They were somewhat woozy, but<br/>quickly recovered.<p>"I am Captain Kiima of Mount Phoenix!"<br/>announced the woman.<p>"I'm Koruma," said the dark skinned boy next<br/>to her.<p>"The name is Masara," finished the lighter<br/>skinned boy. His hair was a spiky mess as well. He<br/>also had a bow and arrows strapped onto his<br/>shoulder.<p>Kiima and Koruma both had swords on their<br/>belts as well. Both boys were wearing expensive<br/>looking silk clothes with mostly ornamental<br/>looking armor. Kiima had little more than an<br/>armored leotard on.<p>Kiima turned and looked at several owls<br/>fluttering around just outside and smirked.<br/>"Thanks for guiding us, return home with our<br/>blessing."<p>Ryoga chuckled as he cracked his knuckles.<br/>"Never would have guessed that you'd come here.<br/>Makes our lives easier."<p>"Pipe down! I'm tryin to make a good<br/>impression!" snapped Dan as he belted the boy<br/>across his head.<p>"Don't bother, you know we're gonna have to<br/>fight her," snorted Carrot. "Real shame though,"<br/>he added with a sigh.<p>"Pigs!" snapped Yohiko.<p>Usagi was standing there with her arms crossed<br/>in front of her chest and a scowl on her face. She<br/>nodded in agreement with her mother. Plum was<br/>standing in the back of the room with Xellos and<br/>Phibrizzo.<p>"You are great sorcerers right? You should do<br/>something!" said the girl nervously.<p>"Oh dear me no!" exclaimed Xellos.<p>"Yeah, we could get hurt," agreed Phibrizzo<br/>cheerfully.<p>"What?" muttered the girl in confusion.<p>Yusaku wasn't taking this whole mess very<br/>well, he simply stood against the wall and stared<br/>at the bird people dumbly. "Man, what a night! No<br/>more of that curry flavored Ramen before bed. Not<br/>ever again!"<p>"Kukuku. Your bravado is quite entertaining to<br/>behold. It would seem that you're not going to<br/>just hand over the Jusenkyo map peacefully."<p>"Well, I might be persuaded..." said Carrot<br/>with a somewhat lecherous looking grin forming on<br/>his face.<p>"Damn! Wish I'd thought of that," grumbled<br/>Dan.<p>Kiima narrowed her eyes at this and smirked.<br/>"So, no agreement can be reached then."<p>"Well that's disappointing, you didn't even<br/>try to negotiate," said Carrot with a small frown.<br/>"I'd like to think a handsome guy like me would<br/>have some kinda chance. Right Dan?"<p>"Yeah," agreed Carrot's mirror image as he<br/>looked down at himself. The only difference<br/>between them was the Dan's shades and the leather<br/>jacket that hung from his shoulders.<p>"Oh, you are soooo dead," growled Yohiko<br/>irritably.<p>"Seems you're already spoken for," said Kiima<br/>as she and her lackeys started to spread out a<br/>bit. "Besides, I'd never soil myself on a mere<br/>landling, no matter how handsome his exterior.<p>Carrot chuckled at this opening and simply<br/>crossed his arms, ignoring her defensive posture.<br/>"Who are you callin a landling?"<p>"What?" muttered Kiima in shock. The trio of<br/>adults all had odd-looking grins on their faces.<br/>The room was suddenly filled as they all grew a<br/>huge pair of bat-like wings from nothing.<p>"What is this?" gasped Kiima in shock. She<br/>backed away and almost fell over her companions.<p>"You've just walked into a trap Lady Kiima,"<br/>said Carrot calmly as he frowned at her. "Too bad,<br/>you really are a babe too."<p>Whap!<p>"OUCH! What the hell is wrong with you?" cried<br/>Carrot as he turned his head just in time to see<br/>Yohiko pulling her wing back with a satisfied<br/>looking smirk on her face.<p>Usagi was drooling on the floor.<br/>"Coooooooooollllll!" Her eyes were wide and she<br/>had an incredibly huge grin on her face.<p>Yusaku was clutching the wall fearfully.<p>Xellos, Ryoga, Plum, and Nephrite were all<br/>simply watching the scene from the back of the<br/>room. They had decided that it would be best to<br/>stand away from the mess.<p>"Maybe we should leave?" asked Plum.<p>"Good idea," agreed Ryoga.<p>"I suppose we should, this could get messy,"<br/>agreed Xellos. He twirled his staff and they<br/>vanished from the room.<p>"The map!" cried Kiima.<p>"I can't believe they left me here!" cried<br/>Yusaku as he stared at the empty spot where the<br/>others had been. "Man."<p>A hand reached out of the plaster and pulled<br/>him inside the wall, leaving only a liquid like<br/>ripple in his wake.<p>Usagi was still kneeling on the floor and now<br/>appeared somewhat thoughtful. "Hmmm..." She closed<br/>her eyes and stood up. Wings like those the others<br/>had were now sprouting from her back, they were a<br/>little smaller, but proportionately around the<br/>same size. "Wow! This is so cool!"<p>Kiima's wings shot straight up, shattering the<br/>ceiling above her. She crossed her arms and<br/>chuckled. "Fools! Thousand Wings of the Seabird<br/>Attack!"<p>Carrot simply folded his wings in front of<br/>himself, creating a sort of cocoon of darkness<br/>around himself.<p>Dan and Yohiko quickly followed his example,<br/>this combined wall blocked Usagi.<p>Kiima smiled in satisfaction, but it quickly<br/>fell away when the wings opened up and revealed<br/>that the group had not even been slightly injured.<br/>"What?"<p>"Surprised?" asked Carrot as he eyed her for a<br/>moment.<p>"Again then!" she snarled. "Thousand..."<p>"Dark Wind!" cried Carrot as he formed a ball<br/>of chi energy in his palms and pointed it at her.<br/>Before she could complete her attack, his wings<br/>swooped down and released a huge burst of wind.<br/>The ball of power in his hand shot forward,<br/>carried by the force of his winds, and increased<br/>them a hundred times.<p>Kiima screamed in pain as the superheated air<br/>slammed into her and shot her through the open<br/>window.<p>"What magic is this?" cried Masara in shock.<p>"Captain Kiima has been defeated? What do we<br/>do now?" said Koruma.<p>"Running would seem to be the best option,"<br/>said Carrot with a small chuckle. "You won't find<br/>that map at the moment, Plum has it and he's run<br/>off with my friend Xellos. Looking for her tonight<br/>would prove fruitless."<p>"Defeated? Have some faith in your Captain!"<br/>snapped Kiima as she appeared in the room and<br/>conked the pair on their heads. She turned her<br/>head towards Carrot and frowned. "And you, that<br/>hurt. You'll pay. Mark my words, we'll meet<br/>again!"<p>"God I hope so," muttered Carrot and Dan in<br/>unison.<p>"Koruma! Masara! To the skies!" snapped Kiima.<p>"Yes, Captain!" cried the pair as they<br/>followed her.<p>"Well, that's over for now. Dang, didn't get a<br/>phone number or anything," grumbled Carrot. "I<br/>must be losing my touch."<p>"Yeah, how depressing," agreed Dan with a<br/>small sigh.<p>"You idiots!" screamed Yohiko. "Think outside<br/>your own pants for once!"<p>"Hey, it's never let me down before," replied<br/>Carrot with a shrug.<p>"If it don't make you drunk, have breasts, or<br/>explode, I ain't interested," replied Dan as he<br/>mirrored Carrot's reaction.<p>"Um, Mom...now what?" asked Usagi in<br/>confusion.<p>"Well, you're going to put those wings away<br/>and go to sleep, I'm going to beat the hell out of<br/>these two, and in the morning, Xellos and Nephrite<br/>will bring Yusaku, your cousin, and Plum back."<p>"But, I wanna try them out!" whined the girl<br/>as she flapped them experimentally.<p>"You'll get plenty of chances later. I don't<br/>want you running around with those bird people<br/>flying about. Just go to sleep."<p>"Yes, Ma'am," grumbled the girl dejectedly.<p>"Right," said Yohiko as she sighed.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Meanwhile, in the Quinghai region of China, at<br/>Mount Phoenix...<p>"Hey old man! Isn't my bath ready yet?"<p>The old birdman knelt before the empty pool<br/>and sighed. "My lord, please be patient for just a<br/>little bit longer. Soon Kiima and her soldiers<br/>will come back with the secrets of Jusenkyo."<p>"Damn it! They're too slow!" snapped Saffron<br/>as he tossed his bath pail into the empty tub.<p>The old man started to shake in fear as a huge<br/>crack appeared in the base. "Yes Lord Saffron! You<br/>have every right to be angry! So I have created<br/>this, in order to ease your suffering." He pulled<br/>what looked like a chalk board eraser from behind<br/>his back and began to tap at it, sending a cloud<br/>of aromatic powder into the air. "See? Smells just<br/>like a bath house!"<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Where are we again?" asked Ryoga as he<br/>glanced around at the glowing walls of brimstone<br/>and flowing magma that surrounded them.<p>"Huh? Just my lab," said Xellos. "It's sort of<br/>a wizards workshop, no big deal really. Don't<br/>worry, you're all protected by my magic here."<p>"Is warm," said Plum nervously.<p>"Ah, it's nice to be home for a while,"<br/>commented Phibrizzo.<p>"Isn't it though?" agreed Xellos.<p>"Sure is scary for a lab," said Yusaku.<p>"Yes, I suppose it is. Sometimes I just have<br/>to have a little room though to try something out.<br/>I suppose it can't be helped."<p>Ryoga sighed again and sat down. "I think I've<br/>been here before." He paused and pointed at the<br/>wall. "Hey! It's still there! This is where I<br/>carved my name in the wall."<p>Xellos blinked and looked at the spot. "Hmm.<br/>So it is. How did you managed to get all the way<br/>down to the thirteenth level though?"<p>"Well, Hells not the same place it used to be<br/>I suppose," commented Phibrizzo.<p>"I guess you're right," agreed Xellos with a<br/>small sigh.<p>"What's that noise?" asked Yusaku as a sort of<br/>wailing floated across the wind.<p>"Huh? Oh that. Just the tortured souls,<br/>nothing to worry about. They're quite a ways away.<br/>I sort of staked this place out for myself. You<br/>can only hear them if they get really loud some<br/>nights. Don't wander off anyone, just try to catch<br/>a little sleep. We've got to go back tomorrow."<p>"Tomorrow?" muttered Yusaku in shock. "We've<br/>got to stay here tonight? Where the hell are we?"<p>"Funny you should mention that..." said<br/>Phibrizzo cheerfully.<p>"Neat!" cried Plum cheerfully as she ran her<br/>hand through the molten magma unharmed by the<br/>flames. She played with it cheerfully and started<br/>to make cute little castles and statues with as if<br/>it was sand on the beach. She didn't even notice<br/>the fact that her clothes had little holes burning<br/>in them now from the splattering. She looked up at<br/>Xellos and smiled. "Can I go swimming?"<p>"Well, okay, but take off your clothes or<br/>they'll burn off and you'll be naked anyway."<p>The girl nodded cheerfully and started<br/>stripping.<p>"This isn't happening to me!" muttered Yusaku<br/>as he clutched the side of his head and started<br/>rocking back and fourth.<p>"Don't be such a weenie, it's only for a few<br/>hours. Teleporting us all took a lot out of me,"<br/>snorted Xellos as he sat back and closed his eyes<br/>to rest.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Dan frowned as he walked down the street with<br/>a bottle in his hand. Naturally, Yohiko's attempt<br/>to beat up Carrot and ended as it always did. The<br/>pair were going at it like sex starved rabbits in<br/>a wool sock. He sighed and took a swig of his beer<br/>as he continued walking through the cool night<br/>air.<p>"Man, why do they gotta make so much damn<br/>noise?" he muttered irritably. He paused when a<br/>mess of arrows landed all around him on the<br/>ground. He blinked and looked around himself<br/>calmly, they had all missed, but not by much.<br/>"Shit." He turned his head and saw Koruma jumping<br/>towards him. The boy was in his human form, and<br/>was lobbing some sort of white things at him.<p>His eyes went wide as he realized what they<br/>were. "Oh man! Shit!" They slammed into his body,<br/>several small eggs that cracked on impact. Before<br/>he could even react he found himself wrapped up in<br/>the tiny fibers that flowed from inside the eggs.<br/>"Well isn't this just fuckin great!"<p>Masara appeared beside his companion and<br/>chuckled. "Ha. Got him."<p>+++++++++++<p>Kiima sat on top of the chimney where they had<br/>created a base of operations. Tiny birds flocked<br/>around her and she spoke to one that was resting<br/>on her hand.<p>"My messenger, report this to Mount Phoenix.<br/>"By the end of the night, the map will be ours!"<p>+++++++++++++++<p>A few hours later, near morning...<p>Kiima caressed the giant egg that had engulfed<br/>Dan and kept her wings wrapped around it to<br/>protect it from the cold night air.<p>Finally, it cracked and she smiled to herself.<br/>She chuckled softly as the arm burst from inside<br/>the egg and smirked.<p>She gasped in shock as two jet black wings<br/>shot out from inside, they were feathered this<br/>time. Like those of an eagle, the egg exploded<br/>outward and the man inside stood up with a smirk<br/>on his face. His eyes cast down to the ground.<br/>"Heh."<p>The bird woman simply stared up at her new<br/>hatchling in shock, unable to speak or move. "What<br/>the?" she managed after a moment.<p>Dan looked at her. His intense gaze locking<br/>with her slightly frightened one. "Hello."<p>Kiima smirked as she stood up and regained her<br/>composure. "I am your mother now. You are my<br/>child, and you will do as I say."<p>Dan smile grew slightly as he watched her<br/>carefully. "Lady, you're much too young to be my<br/>mother."<p>Kiima gasped in shock and stepped back. "It<br/>failed? Wha? How?"<p>The man grabbed her by her shoulders and<br/>leaned her down deeply. "Heh. Gimme some sugar<br/>baby."<p>Kiima's eyes went wide as the man planted his<br/>lips onto hers. She wasn't quite sure what to make<br/>of it. She relaxed slightly as he pulled her back<br/>up to her feet.<p>She staggered for a moment with a huge blush<br/>on her face as he turned away from her and looked<br/>out over the city. "What?"<p>"So, I take it you wanted something from me?<br/>You wouldn't go to all that trouble for nuthin<br/>pretty lady."<p>Kiima smirked at him. "Well, isn't this<br/>interesting."<p>"I want that map, do whatever it takes to get<br/>it," said Kiima as she smirked at him.<p>The man turned his head to look at her again.<br/>He cocked his eyebrow and chuckled. "Groovy." He<br/>stood upright and looked down at the city. "Well,<br/>tough luck Carrot. I get the babe this time. All<br/>that, and I finally get to do what I've always<br/>wanted to. Get ready you bastard." He opened his<br/>wings wide and smirked back at Kiima again.<p>She backed away from him with a slightly<br/>frightened frown on her face. "Tell you what. I'll<br/>call you Mom like you wanted, if you tell me I'm<br/>your Daddy."<p>The woman blinked in confusion, not quite sure<br/>what to make of this.<p>"Looks like I'm gonna have ta show ya," he<br/>replied with another chuckle.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Damn birds," the old man looked out the<br/>window of his apartment and shook his fist at the<br/>sky. The industrial chimney could be seen from his<br/>window and he frowned. "They never used to be this<br/>loud!"<p>"Come to bed and forget about the stupid<br/>birds!" snapped the old woman from the large futon<br/>in the middle of the floor.<p>"I can't! All that racket in the middle of the<br/>night?" snapped the man angrily. "I'm gonna make<br/>some calls tomorrow and see about putting in<br/>another formal complaint!"<p>"You do that, for now come to bed! You're<br/>keeping me up with all this muttering!"<p>"Bah!" cried the man as he waved his hand and<br/>turned away from the window. He just missed seeing<br/>the giant pair of wings appear there, and then the<br/>silhouette of a naked woman arching her back in a<br/>cry of passion before vanishing back down into the<br/>large nest again.<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>It gets better! Next Time: Dan Vs. Nerima.<p>
