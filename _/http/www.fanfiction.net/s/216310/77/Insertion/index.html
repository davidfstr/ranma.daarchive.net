</div>Insertion<p>Part 77<p>The Hot Springs Devil!<p>+++++++++++++<p>Mount Phoenix<p>"You've retrieved the map?" asked<br/>the aged looking birdman who stood<br/>before Kiima, Dan, and her two wards.<p>"Yes," replied Kiima.<p>Dan was standing behind them with<br/>his arms crossed, while the other three<br/>bowed deeply in front of the throne. It<br/>was covered by silken veils that hid the<br/>emperor from view.<p>"It reveals the hidden source of the<br/>springs?" asked the old man.<p>"As you can see," replied Kiima as<br/>she held the page up to him. "We shall<br/>fly to the indicated area immediately.<br/>Soon, the cursed springs will be no more<br/>than a memory."<p>"Good, good," said the old man.<p>"But before you leave Captain Kiima.<br/>His highness grants you an audience. No<br/>doubt he will wish to praise you for<br/>your success."<p>Kiima blinked in surprise at this<br/>announcement.<p>"Lord Saffron will address us?" said<br/>Koruma.<p>"But, he's not here," said Dan as he<br/>looked at them all for a moment.<p>Kiima finally noticed his posture<br/>and blushed. "Why aren't you bowing<br/>fool?"<p>"Bowing to what?" said Dan as he<br/>looked at her.<p>"Lord Saffron! Please forgive him,<br/>he..."<p>Dan snorted and jumped over her<br/>head, landing beside the throne. He<br/>pulled on the rope opening the shades<br/>before anyone could react. "Look, not<br/>here. See?"<p>Everyone blinked as they found<br/>themselves staring at an odd looking<br/>statue. It was a clown with a drum in<br/>his lap.<p>"Forgive me, liege, but...I never<br/>imagined that the heir to the throne of<br/>Phoenix Mountain... would look exactly<br/>like one of those statues that you find<br/>outside a restaurant," said Koruma<br/>dumbly.<p>"This is one of those statues that<br/>you find outside a restaurant," said<br/>Kiima as she stared at it.<p>"AAAAAUUUUUGGGGGHHHH! His highness<br/>has run off again!" cried the old man.<p>"So, should we go to this place on<br/>the map...or..." said Dan as he looked<br/>at Kiima for a moment.<p>"No fool! We have to find Lord<br/>Saffron!" growled the woman.<p>"Oh," said Dan with a small shrug.<br/>"Okay."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Are we there yet?" grumbled Usagi.<p>"Bweeee!" cried Ryoga from the top<br/>of her head.<p>She sighed and looked at her<br/>parents. "Are you sure this is my<br/>cousin?"<p>"Yes dear," said Yohiko with a small<br/>sigh.<p>"But...it's a pig," said the girl in<br/>irritation as she plucked the animal off<br/>the top of her head and held it at arms<br/>length.<p>"Yeah? So? I know a guy who turns<br/>into a duck," said Carrot with a small<br/>shrug.<p>"Oh," grumbled Usagi as she put<br/>Ryoga back onto her head.<p>The animal snorted and clung on<br/>again.<p>"Are you sure?" repeated Usagi.<p>"How long is she going to be like<br/>this?" asked Plum as she looked at Ukyo.<p>"Well, I'm used to this sort of<br/>thing. Ryoga's curse is new to me<br/>though," said the chef with a small<br/>shrug.<p>"Still, Curses of Jusenkyo very<br/>tragic," said the girl.<p>"Well, I'm not so sure the pig<br/>doesn't deserve it," responded Ukyo with<br/>another shrug.<p>Ryoga squealed at her angrily.<p>"We're getting close, it's just past<br/>that seventh mountain!" said Plum as she<br/>pointed in the right direction.<p>"Good," said Yohiko.<p>Ryoga squealed excitedly on top of<br/>his cousin's head. "Ouch! Quit it!"<br/>cried the girl.<p>"Hey, a hot spring," said Carrot as<br/>he smiled to himself. "Maybe we should<br/>stop. Ryoga won't be much good to us as<br/>he is now."<p>"All right!" cried Usagi happily.<p>Carrot and Yohiko smirked at each<br/>other as the youths rushed off towards<br/>the entrance.<p>Herb landed beside them and looked<br/>at them both. "Hey, there's a hot spring<br/>up ahead... Oh."<p>"The point of scouting ahead, is to<br/>tell us before we get there," said<br/>Carrot.<p>"I'm not used to this role,"<br/>grumbled Herb as she blushed slightly.<p>"The kids are too green for that<br/>kind of work," said Yohiko. "Carrot and<br/>I did it earlier, and it's your turn."<p>Plum was standing in the middle of<br/>the road, looking at a large crack in<br/>the ground. "Uh oh," said the girl with<br/>a slight frown.<p>"What?" asked Carrot as he walked up<br/>next to her.<p>"Big crack in ground is never a good<br/>sign," replied the girl as she looked up<br/>at him.<p>"Oh yes. I forgot to say, the<br/>springs appear to have been attacked,"<br/>said Herb.<p>"Great, he sucks at this too, we<br/>might as well have sent Usagi," grumbled<br/>Yohiko.<p>"Well, we'd best go get the kids.<br/>Come on Herb," said Carrot as he pulled<br/>the girl along behind him.<p>"Unhand me! My legs work fine!"<br/>snapped Herb irritably.<p>"Fine, fine. Let's just go. Those<br/>idiot girls probably took Ryoga with<br/>them," said the boy with a small sigh.<p>"I'll try to get him to you before<br/>he passes out from blood loss," muttered<br/>Yohiko as she sighed and started<br/>walking.<p>Plum found herself standing alone as<br/>the group separated. She turned her head<br/>and saw a footlocker on the side of the<br/>road. It shifted, and a man fell out<br/>onto the ground looking rather beaten.<p>"Aiya!" She rushed over to his side.<br/>"What happened here Mr. Employee-type<br/>person?"<p>"D-devil! The Hot Springs Devil<br/>attacked!" muttered the man as he passed<br/>out.<p>"Hot Springs Devil? What in the...?"<br/>muttered the girl to herself.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Ahhhhh," was the collective sigh<br/>from the group of girls as they sat in<br/>the water.<p>Yohiko walked up to Usagi and pulled<br/>the pig off of her head. He was clinging<br/>to her for dear life, and wasn't moving.<br/>"You forgot your cousin," she said with<br/>a small smirk.<p>"What? Ryoga you pervert!" screamed<br/>Ukyo as she covered herself up suddenly.<p>"The poor jerk is out cold, guess we<br/>were too much for him to handle," said<br/>Yohiko cheerfully.<p>Plum walked up nervously and poked<br/>her fingers together. "Um, it's not safe<br/>here."<p>Usagi and Ukyo looked around for a<br/>moment and blinked.<p>"You know, she might be right,"<br/>commented Usagi.<p>Several women were floating around<br/>in the water out cold.<p>"Yeah, I guess so," agreed Ukyo.<p>Yohiko shrugged and unceremoniously<br/>tossed Ryoga over her shoulder. He<br/>sailed over the wall and into the men's<br/>side. "Don't worry about it kid. Hop<br/>in," she said to Plum as she started<br/>removing the girl's clothes along with<br/>her own.<p>The little girl blushed and sat down<br/>in the water. "Shouldn't we be ready for<br/>an attack?"<p>"Nah, let the guys worry about it,"<br/>said the woman as she winked at her.<br/>"Besides, how long do you think a<br/>pervert would last with this group?"<p>"She's got a point," said Ukyo<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Oh, okay," said Plum.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Wonder how long until we're<br/>attacked?" asked Carrot as Ryoga came up<br/>from under the water and gasped.<p>"I...saw..." muttered the lost boy<br/>with his eyes wide.<p>"Yeah, I'm sure you'll treasure the<br/>memory always," grumbled Carrot.<p>"Tell me about it," said Herb as he<br/>moved over to Ryoga's side.<p>"Oh, forget about it. It was just<br/>Ukyo," said Carrot as he rolled his<br/>eyes.<p>"Yes, but I had no idea those<br/>bindings she wore...were that tight!"<br/>said Ryoga as he looked at Carrot with<br/>tears in his eyes.<p>"Found a new love?" snorted Carrot.<p>"I doubt if they can compare to my<br/>wife," said Herb with a serious looking<br/>nod. "Still, I am curious."<p>"What wife?" snapped Ryoga as he was<br/>shaken out of his stupor.<p>"Don't start that again," grumbled<br/>Carrot.<p>"If you want to see them so badly,<br/>go take a look. They're just over the<br/>wall," said Carrot as he pointed it out<br/>to Herb.<p>"Do you think they'd mind?" asked<br/>Herb with a blush on his face.<p>"Of course they would. The danger<br/>element is what makes it fun," said<br/>Carrot cheerfully.<p>"You sound like that old man!"<br/>snapped Ryoga.<p>"I wasn't the one singing the<br/>praises of Ukyo Kuonji's breasts a<br/>minute ago," snorted the man as he<br/>closed his eyes and sat back against a<br/>rock.<p>"I was not! I was just surprised<br/>that's all!" cried the boy defensively.<br/>"And I don't love her!"<p>"Wonder if Akari is that stacked?"<br/>muttered Carrot to himself.<p>"Hey!" snapped Ryoga.<p>"What? You don't wonder?" replied<br/>the man as he arched his eyebrow at the<br/>boy.<p>"That's not the point! Don't talk<br/>about my girlfriend that way!" snapped<br/>Ryoga.<p>"You know...Yohiko married into the<br/>Hibiki clan as I recall. That would mean<br/>Usagi, isn't really your cousin," said<br/>Carrot as he looked thoughtful for a<br/>moment.<p>"I...what?" Ryoga stared at him for<br/>a moment.<p>"Enough of this. I must know!" cried<br/>Herb as he was suddenly overcome with<br/>chargin. He waded over to the wall with<br/>a determined frown on his face and<br/>started to scale it.<p>"Sheesh, and Yohiko calls me a<br/>pervert," muttered Carrot to himself.<p>"Hey! Usagi is over there!" cried<br/>Ryoga.<p>"Do you wish to join me then?" asked<br/>Herb as he stared at Ryoga for a moment.<p>"I...No! Stop that you pervert!"<p>"What is this word? I keep hearing<br/>it? What does pervert mean?" asked Herb.<br/>"My queen calls me that all the time. It<br/>puzzles me."<p>Ryoga blinked at him again. "What?"<p>+++++++++++++<p>"What's all that shouting?" muttered<br/>Plum.<p>"The idiots don't realize we can<br/>hear them, that's all," said Yohiko with<br/>a small frown.<p>Usagi was blushing and staring at<br/>the wall, while Ukyo had a few spatulas<br/>ready to lob at anyone who dared peer<br/>over the wall.<p>"I don't believe this!" cried Ukyo<br/>angrily.<p>"Hey. What's that?" asked Plum as<br/>she stared at the water.<p>"Huh?" replied the other women as<br/>they turned towards what she was<br/>pointing at.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"Lord Saffron! Where are you?"<br/>thought Kiima as she flew along the<br/>ground with her three companions. "He<br/>shouldn't have gone below! Not in his<br/>current state!"<p>"What are you on about?" grumbled<br/>Dan as he frowned at her.<p>"Our lord is missing!" she snapped.<p>"Don't get mad at me, I never even<br/>met the guy. Calm down, I'm sure he'll<br/>be back before us."<p>"I hope you're right," said Koruma.<p>"Lord Saffron could be in danger<br/>though!" cried Masara.<p>"I doubt it," muttered Dan<br/>irritably.<p>+++++++++++++<p>The girl's side was staring at a<br/>huge shadow in the water. "What the?"<br/>grumbled Yohiko. "What is that?" She<br/>peered at the shadow for a moment and a<br/>metallic sounding ring filled the air.<p>"Something is happening!" cried<br/>Ukyo.<p>The water around the blasted upward,<br/>and a few of the rocks in the spring<br/>suddenly exploded around them. They all<br/>dodged around the falling stones.<p>Plum was clinging to Usagi when it<br/>all settled down, and they were all<br/>looking at a huge red thing shrouded in<br/>the steam. "Aiya! What this is?"<p>"It's huge!" cried Ukyo as she threw<br/>several spatulas at it.<p>The thing unceremoniously hissed at<br/>them and deflated into little more than<br/>a spot on the water.<p>Yohiko walked up to it and frowned.<br/>"It's... a pool toy."<p>She turned around suddenly as a ring<br/>flew out of the air towards her. "What?"<br/>she managed to catch it between her<br/>hands and was thrown back by the force<br/>of its motion. She was pushed halfway<br/>across the springs and slammed into a<br/>boulder. It shattered under the force of<br/>her impact and the ring continued to fly<br/>away.<p>"Mom!" cried Usagi.<p>"Miss Yohiko!" called the others.<p>"What the?" muttered the woman as<br/>she shook her head.<p>The ring continued it's path into<br/>the air, and stopped at the top of a<br/>staff that poked out from behind the<br/>rocks nearby.<p>"Who?" muttered Usagi dumbly.<p>A small boy appeared before them, he<br/>had black hair with orange highlights.<br/>His clothes were unusual, expensive<br/>looking silk garments with a cape, and a<br/>plate of armor over his chest. He held<br/>an odd looking staff in his hand with a<br/>ring on the top of it.<p>"Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Fools! Those who<br/>dare try and use these hot springs<br/>without my expressly given consent, are<br/>not long for this world!"<p>"What the?" grumbled Yohiko.<p>The girls were all staring at him,<br/>looking rather dumbstruck at the haughty<br/>looking child.<p>Finally, Usagi spoke up.<br/>"EEEEEEEEEKKKKK! A PERVERT!"<p>The rest of the girls, Yohiko<br/>included, promptly screamed and dove a<br/>little deeper into the water. A moment<br/>later, Usagi and Yohiko stood up,<br/>dressed in bathing suits.<p>"I wish I had one of those,"<br/>grumbled Ukyo.<p>Plum nodded in agreement, her face<br/>completely red. "That jerk! He same age!<br/>What doing thing like this?"<p>"Good question," grumbled Ukyo.<p>"There's that word again," commented<br/>Herb as he peered over the wall.<p>"We heard screaming!" called Ryoga<br/>from beside him.<p>Carrot was wisely absent.<p>Huge boulders were ripped up from<br/>the springs, and flung towards anything<br/>male.<p>The boy laughed at this as the ring<br/>flew from the top of his staff and<br/>shattered the stone. Ryoga and Herb were<br/>sent back behind the wall, with boulders<br/>in their faces. "Fool! You underestimate<br/>the power of the Kinjakan!"<p>"Is Hot Springs Devil!" cried Plum<br/>in shock.<p>The boy fell face first onto the<br/>ground as Yohiko planted her fist into<br/>the back of his head. She had come up<br/>behind him after throwing the boulder.<p>"So this is him huh?" muttered<br/>Yohiko.<p>"Yes, apparently he's been trashing<br/>the area for the past two or three<br/>days," said Plum as she finished<br/>dressing herself with Ukyo.<p>Carrot walked up behind them and<br/>picked up the boy's staff. "Bothersome<br/>little runt isn't he?"<p>"What are you doing over here?"<br/>cried Ukyo angrily.<p>"Oh shut up. I waited until you were<br/>all dressed," replied the man with a<br/>casual snort. "Besides, all of you are<br/>too young to interest me anyway, and<br/>I've seen her naked before." He jerked<br/>his thumb at Yohiko.<p>The woman growled and blushed at<br/>this, but didn't press it. "Who is this<br/>little bastard?"<p>Carrot looked over at the wall for a<br/>moment. "The Hot Springs Devil."<p>"I know that!" snarled Yohiko.<p>Carrot thought about it for a moment<br/>and sighed. "Never heard of him before."<p>"You know something, I'm not stupid,<br/>Carrot," replied the woman.<p>"Maybe I do, but I've got my own<br/>reasons for not saying anything," he<br/>responded coolly.<p>"Right," grumbled Yohiko irritably.<p>"Kill me! I would rather die than<br/>endure this humiliation!" snarled the<br/>boy as he struggled against the ropes<br/>they had used to bind him.<p>"Okay," said Carrot as he started<br/>towards him.<p>"He's just a kid!" cried Usagi.<p>"What?" muttered the boy as he<br/>looked up at them.<p>"He asked for it though," said the<br/>man as he stared at the dumbfound boy.<p>"You! I'll get you for this!"<br/>snarled the boy.<p>"Not if you're dead you won't," said<br/>Carrot.<p>"We don't have time for this Carrot,<br/>quit screwing around," said Yohiko.<p>"Remember that you told me that<br/>later," he responded. His face wasn't<br/>visible to them and they couldn't read<br/>anything from his voice.<p>"Whatever, can we go now? We need to<br/>get to Mount Phoenix," said Yohiko.<br/>"We've wasted too much time as it is."<p>"Wait a second! You're going to<br/>Mount Phoenix?" said the boy.<p>Carrot smirked. "What of it?"<p>"If we use the Kinjakan, I can get<br/>us there by this evening," said the boy<br/>calmly.<p>"It will take two more days," said<br/>Plum as she looked up at Yohiko.<p>"I think we should take his way,"<br/>said Usagi.<p>"Come on, let's go collect the<br/>boys," said Yohiko.<p>"Do we have to?" grumbled Ukyo.<p>"Yes, we'll probably need them,"<br/>said Plum.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>The boy rode atop his staff, the<br/>ring was moving along the ground and he<br/>was going at an incredible rate of<br/>speed.<p>"Whoa. He's fast," said Usagi as she<br/>struggled to keep up.<p>"You're just slacking off, that's<br/>all," said Carrot as he carried Plum on<br/>his shoulders.<p>Ryoga was being dragged along the<br/>ground by Herb. "Slow down you jerk!"<p>"You're not hurt, quit complaining,"<br/>snorted the Dragon-man as he glanced<br/>back at him.<p>"Damn you! I'll get you for this<br/>Herb!" cried the lost boy angrily as he<br/>was hit in the face by another rock.<br/>Herb was correct though, he wasn't even<br/>feeling it.<p>"Hey! I can see it! It's Phoenix<br/>Mountain!" cried Plum.<p>"Finally," grumbled Ukyo as Yohiko<br/>dropped her wrist. She had been pulling<br/>her along as well.<p>The boy smirked as he stopped next<br/>to a doorway on the mountainside. "This<br/>is the entrance to the inner halls."<p>"Yeah, thanks kid. You've been a big<br/>help. I'll see you later," said Carrot.<p>"I'm surprised you were able to keep<br/>up," admitted Saffron as he looked at<br/>the Kinjakan for a moment.<p>"Bye Mr. Devil, you weren't so bad<br/>after all," said Usagi.<p>"The brat bothers me," grumbled Herb<br/>as he glanced back at the boy.<p>"We shouldn't trust him," agreed<br/>Yohiko.<p>"You're right, he's going to show us<br/>the way," said Carrot.<p>"What?" muttered the boy dumbly.<p>"Come on kid, we're not stupid<br/>enough to leave you out here alone,"<br/>said Carrot with a chuckle.<p>The boy growled at this and stepped<br/>back. "I won't."<p>Carrot leaned his head in next to<br/>the boy. "Come on Saffron, lead the way<br/>to the map, or I'll tell the Musk King<br/>here who you are. Think you can take him<br/>now?"<p>The boy's eyes went wide and he<br/>gasped. "You...knew?"<p>"I'm looking for someone, and I'll<br/>bet I'll find him when I find that map,"<br/>said Carrot quietly. "We've got a score<br/>to settle. I'll worry about you later."<p>Saffron growled and nodded slowly.<p>Yohiko blinked and stared at Carrot.<br/>"What did you tell him?"<p>The rest of the group was waiting<br/>for an answer as well.<p>"I threatened to tell his parents<br/>what he was doing at those springs if he<br/>didn't take us where we wanted to go.<br/>The little runt is a Phoenix native."<p>Saffron looked back at Carrot for a<br/>moment and growled. "You'd better keep<br/>quiet about this."<p>"Lead the way then, and no tricks,"<br/>said the man as he smirked at him.<p>Everyone took that as proof of what<br/>they had been told. Yohiko was still a<br/>bit skeptical though.<p>"I trust you about as much as I<br/>trust Xellos," she grumbled.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Hot springs you say?" asked the old<br/>man as he stood in Lord Saffron's<br/>bedchambers. They were preparing for the<br/>boy's return.<p>"Yes, I think this Hot Springs Devil<br/>the landlings are talking about is him,"<br/>said Dan with a small nod.<p>"I'm forced to agree," said Kiima<br/>with a small nod.<p>"Well, Kiima did well in picking you<br/>up," said the old man cheerfully.<p>"Who says she picked me?" replied<br/>Dan casually.<p>Kiima looked at him for a moment and<br/>frowned. "Still, if he is instinctively<br/>seeking out Hot Springs. It could only<br/>mean one thing."<p>"Yes, the transformation is at<br/>hand," agreed the old man. "We must get<br/>control of the source of Jusenkyo now."<p>"That's good to know," said a<br/>familiar voice from behind them.<p>The trio turned around to face the<br/>doorway. "What?"<p>"Hey Dan, I've come for my map,"<br/>said Carrot as he stood at the head of<br/>the group. They were standing in the<br/>doorway glaring at them. A trail of<br/>fallen guards in their wake. The<br/>entrance to Saffron's bedchamber was a<br/>long bridge that stretched across a two-<br/>thousand-foot drop.<p>"It is comforting to know that I am<br/>not too late," said Herb as he crossed<br/>his arms and chuckled.<p>"That was enjoyable," said Saffron<br/>as he glanced down at one of the fallen<br/>guards. He'd almost started giving<br/>orders to kill the others, but they'd<br/>started beating on his men rather<br/>easily. He'd decided to join in, rather<br/>than risk discovery just yet. "Too bad.<br/>Kiima, destroy them."<p>"What?" said Herb as he spun around<br/>to stare at the boy.<p>"Yes my Lord!" screamed the woman as<br/>she charged.<p>"Heh," said Carrot as he stepped<br/>back.<p>"Not so fast," said Dan as he<br/>appeared in front of him.<p>"Not yet Dan," replied Carrot<br/>coolly. "I'm saving you for later. How<br/>about that map?"<p>Dan chuckled and tossed a rolled up<br/>scroll from inside his shirt at the man.<br/>"Here."<p>"What are you doing?" cried Kiima.<p>"Relax, that's just a copy. We still<br/>have the real one," he whispered to her<br/>carefully.<p>It was obvious that Carrot had heard<br/>him, but the others were occupied by a<br/>new wave of guards.<p>"So, I can destroy Saffron easily<br/>now," said Herb with a cold smile on his<br/>lips.<p>"Arrogant landling," snarled Kiima.<p>"Really Kiima, insulting a King that<br/>way," said Carrot.<p>"Hello Herb," said Dan as he turned<br/>to face the man.<p>"It's Lord Herb!" cried the old man<br/>in shock. "No! It's too soon!"<p>"Thousand Wings of the Seabird<br/>attack!" cried Kiima in shock as she<br/>jumped back away from the man.<p>Herb dodged easily around the<br/>strikes and chuckled. "Die!" He raised<br/>his hand, and a bolt of power shot<br/>towards Saffron. The boy's eyes went<br/>wide with fear.<p>Dan appeared in front of him with<br/>his wings spread wide. He snarled and<br/>backhanded the ball of power away. "Not<br/>so fast!"<p>Carrot stood by and did nothing. He<br/>chuckled and watched as Dan scooped up<br/>the boy and tossed him to Kiima.<p>"Get to Jusendo, I'll hold them<br/>off," he snarled.<p>The woman nodded, and jumped off the<br/>bridge and into the air.<p>"No!" snarled Herb as he started to<br/>give chase. A strong blow to his chest<br/>sent him sprawling back into the others.<p>Ukyo managed to catch him and<br/>staggered back slightly. The guards were<br/>now all defeated and they turned to look<br/>at Dan for a moment as he floated just<br/>above them on the bridge.<p>"Think you can take all of us Dan?"<br/>asked Yohiko.<p>"Ah, the things I do for love,"<br/>replied the man as he chuckled. He<br/>reached into his shirt and pulled out a<br/>small remote.<p>"What the?" muttered Carrot as he<br/>uncrossed his arms. "Everybody jump!<br/>Now!"<p>The bridge exploded in a huge ball<br/>of flames as Dan pressed the button on<br/>the small remote. The explosive charges<br/>he'd set up went off all at once,<br/>shattering it completely.<p>"What have you done!" cried the old<br/>man in shock.<p>"I'm not strong enough to fight them<br/>all, take all the men you can, and get<br/>ready for them at Jusendo. We've got to<br/>hurry." He dove down after the debris of<br/>the bridge and chuckled at what he<br/>found.<p>Carrot, Usagi, and Yohiko were<br/>carrying Plum, Ryoga, and Ukyo. Herb was<br/>descending under his own power, but he<br/>couldn't hold himself up much longer. He<br/>was now following after them in a<br/>controlled fall.<p>"Come to finish us off?" snarled<br/>Yohiko as she clutched Ukyo a little<br/>tighter.<p>"Please," snorted Dan in disgust.<br/>"I'll be waiting for you at Jusendo<br/>Carrot, don't disappoint me."<p>"Count on it," said Carrot coldly.<br/>"Come on, we're wasting time by staying<br/>here." He dove towards the ground and<br/>was followed by the others.<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Jusendo!
