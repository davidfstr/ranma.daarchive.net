</div>Insertion<p>Part 8<p>Assault on Diamos<p>+++++++++++<p>Darkness, it was all that surrounded her as she glared into the<br/>shadows. Only the pale light of the tube of green liquid gave any<br/>indication that the entire room was not a black void of nothing.<br/>Several machines could be seen nearby, lit by the pale glow.<p>Pluto floated inside the tube; her body curled up in a fetal<br/>position. Her eyes simply stared forward as she waited for her body to<br/>heal, a process that would take considerable time. Her arm was nothing<br/>more than a stump, and part of her right leg was missing, almost the<br/>entire length of her body was covered in burn scars from the massive<br/>blast that had consumed her. A dark rage boiled in her heart, hatred,<br/>anger. She knew all these things.<p>Yet there was something more, a painful loss. Something long<br/>forgotten in the streams of time. The mere thought that he could hurt<br/>her at all was alien too her. Genaku was always a thorn at her side,<br/>an irritation that was to be disposed of. However, he had never once<br/>raised his hand against her.<p>Now things had changed, somewhere deep in her heart, she thought<br/>that maybe he hadn't fallen to the darkness. Perhaps he managed to<br/>escape that fate, he was always strong. Beryl was too much though,<br/>there was no way he could have survived, or been reborn without her.<br/>Now, all that hope had been crushed, as tiny as it was to begin with.<p>As it had always been, they were opposed. Now it was more than<br/>words and ideals, now, she had to destroy him.<p>That was when she saw the two eyes staring back at her from<br/>outside the tank. She simply stared at them, an expression of any kind<br/>simply too painful to make.<p>"You were defeated," said the voice from outside. Her body was<br/>hidden by the darkness.<p>Pluto felt shame, shame that the other had to see her this way.<br/>Slowly, painfully, she nodded once.<p>"That isn't acceptable," said the voice calmly.<p>Pluto felt her heart jump, she was unable to move. If she could,<br/>she would have been banging against the glass of her healing tank, and<br/>screaming for her not to interfere. There was nothing she could do,<br/>she would not survive more than a few moments outside her self made<br/>prison at the moment.<p>+++++++++++<p>"What the hell did you do, Ranma?" said Carrot in irritation as he<br/>sat down on the roof of the Tendo home. "This is more than a passing<br/>annoyance."<p>"I didn't do nuthin!" said Ranma in retort.<p>"Carrot is right," agreed Dan coolly. "This isn't some minor<br/>irritation we're dealing with. Those two were trying to kill us."<p>"Yeah, but why?" said Carrot as he painfully tried to think of<br/>some reason for the woman's discomfort.<p>"Well? Tell us brain boy," said Dan grumpily.<p>"I haven't got a clue damn it! Why don't you ask Ranma? It was his<br/>stupid past life!" snorted Carrot.<p>"I told you! I didn't do nuthin!" snapped Ranma irritably.<p>"Look, if it wasn't us. It had to be Genaku, it's the only<br/>explanation for this. We need to figure out what he did, and maybe<br/>we'll be able to get out of this mess," said Dan.<p>"We'll work it out later, it isn't save for us to hang around here<br/>at night," said Carrot with a small sigh.<p>"Huh?" said Ranma.<p>"The senshi have ways of finding us, we need to be gone at night,"<br/>said Carrot.<p>"This isn't good, maybe we should get the old man and take off on<br/>a training trip for a few years?" said Dan.<p>"Genma might has well have cemented his ass in front of that Shogi<br/>table, he's not going anywhere without a fight," said Carrot.<p>"Wait a minute? We're running from some stupid girls?" said Ranma<br/>angrily. "I don't run from nobody!"<p>"That's why you're an idiot. I know when we're outclassed. We hit<br/>those girls with bullets, and it didn't take them down. I imagine that<br/>explosion did little more than piss them off," said Carrot with<br/>another nod.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"My hair!" cried Minako as she stared at her reflection in the<br/>mirror sadly. "When I find that bastard...I'll..." she clenched her<br/>fists in frustration and glared at the reflective surface with hatred<br/>in her eyes. "Look what he did to my beautiful skin! I'm all red!"<p>"You've got to calm down," pleaded Artemis as he hopped up on the<br/>dresser.<p>"Calm down? Calm down? Look at my complexion! I look like a<br/>lobster!" screamed the girl as she threw her hands into the air.<p>Artemis backed away nervously from the ranting. "Please! We have<br/>to think of something! We can't just attack him head on, he's too<br/>strong for you by yourself!"<p>Minako hung her head and sighed, "You're right, but what can I<br/>do?"<p>"That's what we need a plan for," said Artemis calmly.<p>"Any word about that other senshi?" said Minako as she suddenly<br/>became serious. She had a sort of sad look in her eyes.<p>"The authorities didn't find anything according to the papers. If<br/>they did, they aren't saying anything. You weren't hurt, maybe she got<br/>away too?"<p>"Not hurt?" said Minako with a slight growl. "Look! I had to cut<br/>my luxurious hair! It only goes to the middle of my back now!"<br/>screamed the girl as she stood up and pointed at the bottom of her<br/>long blonde locks. The base was cut even now, and ended just above the<br/>small of her back.<p>"Heh, you could awaken the other senshi," said a new voice.<p>Artemis and Minako whirled around and saw a strange figure<br/>standing in the window, staring at them.<p>It was a girl about her own age. She had long violet hair that was<br/>tied up in a ponytail, her violet eyes were locked on the pair in a<br/>cold stare. Her clothes weren't unusual, a yellow turtleneck sweater,<br/>and a pleated skirt.<p>"Who are you?" said Minako in shock.<p>"I am Tsuki," replied the girl calmly as she leaned against the<br/>windowsill.<p>"What do you want? What's this about other senshi?"<p>"There are five inner senshi. One for each planet except for Earth<br/>of course, and one for the moon."<p>"That's nine," said Artemis coolly as he walked up to the window.<p>"The outer senshi are not of concern to you," said the girl<br/>calmly. "You only need to find Moon, Mars, Mercury, and Jupiter."<p>"Who are you? What's your connection to this?" said Artemis as he<br/>narrowed his eyes at the girl and moved behind Minako's legs.<p>"That's my business. Just go to Juban, and follow the rabbit,"<br/>said the girl coldly as she jumped away and left them.<p>"Wait!" cried Minako as she rushed up to the window. Predictably,<br/>the girl was gone. "Damn."<p>Of course, neither her nor Artemis bothered to look down, where<br/>Tsuki was laying face down on the ground. She groaned painfully and<br/>did not move. After a moment Minako turned away from the window, and<br/>Tsuki picked up her head. "Damn. I forgot that was the second floor.<br/>Ite..." She slowly stood up and staggered into the streets.<p>++++++++++<p>Ryoga blinked and looked at the skinny looking bridge and then<br/>back to the old man again. "But, I don't want to cross the bridge of<br/>death. I'm trying to get to Nerima."<p>"Just answer the questions," said the old man.<p>"We want to cross the bridge of death though!" said the group of<br/>British knights that stood directly behind him.<p>One of the nights stepped forward. "Ask your questions."<p>"What is your name?"<p>"Lancelot, knight of the round table!"<p>"What is your quest?"<p>"To find the Holy Grail!"<p>"What is your favorite color?"<p>"Blue."<p>"All right, off you go then," said the old man.<p>Ryoga hung his head. "I might as well," he sighed.<p>"What is your name?" said the old man ominously.<p>"Ryoga Hibiki."<p>"What is your quest?"<p>"To find Ranma Saotome, and finally defeat him!"<p>"What is the value of Pi?"<p>Ryoga blinked, and looked at the old man's leer for a moment. "To<br/>what decimal?"<p>"Huh? I don't know that!" said the old man. He was promptly flung<br/>into the gorge by some unseen force, and was never heard from again.<p>"How do you know these things?" said one of the knights to him.<p>Ryoga stared at him for a moment. "I'm Asian, everyone knows we're<br/>good at math."<p>"Oh, quite right," agreed the other knights as they moved across<br/>the bridge just in front of him. He stood aside and waited for them to<br/>pass.<p>Ryoga stood and waited for them to pass and then stepped onto the<br/>bridge. He frowned as it creaked under his weight. "Oh, right.<br/>Jupiter," he muttered calmly. The boards under his feet gave way, and<br/>he plummeted into the pit below.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Her name is Minako, she's about five-four. She's got long blonde<br/>hair and blue eyes. She's also a bit boy crazy too," said Ranma as he<br/>looked at the group of teens.<p>"Buddy, we're all lookin for that chick," said one of the boys<br/>with a rough snort.<p>The boys around him chuckled in crude agreement and then turned<br/>back to their game.<p>"What are we doing here?" said Ranma to himself as he turned away<br/>from the group, or rather the others in his head.<p>"Trying to nip this in the butt, that's what," he told himself in<br/>reply.<p>A group of girls walked by, giving him a wide area of clearance as<br/>he passed. He was wearing his coat and hat again, and had a pair of<br/>shades covering his eyes.<p>+++++++++<p>"All right, hold it," said Ranma as he stopped their body and<br/>moved over to a quiet corner of the room. They were inside the arcade,<br/>asking around for any information on Minako they could get.<p>"What's up?" said Carrot in confusion.<p>"What's going on here? We're looking for trouble," said Ranma<br/>angrily.<p>"We're trying to avoid it. As much as Dan would enjoy it, I'm sure<br/>the two of us don't want to end up running around shooting up half of<br/>Tokyo."<p>"Right," agreed Ranma.<p>"We're going to find Minako, and try to explain things. Maybe we<br/>can still talk our way out of this," said Carrot calmly.<p>"Not after we blew up Pluto we can't," said Dan calmly.<p>"Hey I had to do it! We didn't have a choice!" said Ranma<br/>defensively. "Besides, it wasn't the planet, it was one of the moons!"<p>"I don't think he's talking about the fight earlier," commented<br/>Carrot.<p>"Anyway, we need to find her soon, before she gets the others on<br/>us," said Carrot calmly. "There are nine senshi, we've only met two,<br/>and some of them are stronger than the pair we fought. Believe me<br/>Ranma, we don't want to fight these chicks."<p>"Right," muttered Ranma irritably. "That doesn't explain why<br/>everyone is avoiding us."<p>"Oh that, they think we're with the Yakuza, that's why," said Dan<br/>calmly.<p>"What?" said Ranma in shock.<p>"Enough about that, you remember something don't you?" said Carrot<br/>with a sly looking grin crossing their face for a moment.<p>"No," said Ranma pointedly.<p>"We're going to find out sooner or later," said Dan with a small<br/>sigh. "It's best not to worry about that now though."<p>"Why is that?" asked Carrot.<p>"Because we're about to get a visit from an old friend," said Dan<br/>with a small chuckle.<p>++++++++++++++<p>The wall of the arcade crashed in suddenly, revealing a familiar<br/>looking girl with a bonbori held out in front of her. "You! Is Captain<br/>Destructo! Where Ranma?"<p>"Ack!" said Ranma in shocked surprise. "Shampoo, what are you<br/>doing here?"<p>"Come to find girl, and kill!" said the Amazon bitterly.<p>"You know I won't allow that," said Ranma coolly as he stared her<br/>down for a moment.<p>"Why? Girl is Destructo airen?" said Shampoo with a smirk forming<br/>on her face.<p>"Not really," said the boy with a small shrug.<p>"Husband very bad run away, Shampoo," said the girl as she glared<br/>at him for a moment. "His wives in village very angry."<p>That got the attention of the crowd of dumbstruck onlookers. One<br/>of the boys perked up suddenly and turned towards the black clad teen.<br/>"Wives?"<p>"Heh, your laws don't apply to me. I thought I made that clear<br/>when we left," said Ranma coolly as he stared her down for a long<br/>moment. "I'll never be a second class citizen."<p>"Showing such disrespect. I can't forgive that," said a new voice<br/>from the hole Shampoo had made her entrance through. A handsome<br/>looking Chinese boy stepped through, but placed a thick looking pair<br/>of glasses on his face as he entered. "For forcing Shampoo into your<br/>arms, and ignoring the laws of the Amazons, you must be punished."<p>Ranma smirked at the boy. "Hello Mousse."<p>"It's been a while," said the boy in reply with a small nod of his<br/>head. "You won't escape this time."<p>"Escape? I've never been afraid of you two losers," said Ranma<br/>with a cruel sounding chuckle. "Besides, Shampoo came into my arms<br/>willingly as I recall."<p>"What?" said Mousse in shock. He turned towards the girl and<br/>started to blubber. "Shampoo! You didn't!"<p>The girl looked at Ranma for a moment with a rather blank<br/>expression. She knew it wasn't true, but... "Is Shampoo husband." She<br/>shrugged her shoulders and turned back to Ranma again. "You come home<br/>to China with wife now."<p>"Heh, make me," said Ranma with another chuckle.<p>"If that way Destructo want it," said the girl as she grinned and<br/>prepared herself.<p>Mousse charged in front of her. "Enemy to all women!" Various<br/>blades shot from his arms and into the crowd. Those who weren't smart<br/>enough to leave before this, now quickly vacated.<p>Ranma smirked and sidestepped most of the attacks. "Come on then."<p>"Stupid Mousse!" cried Shampoo as she backed away from the battle.<p>Ranma spun around as Mousse sailed over his head, drawing the two<br/>silver weapons from behind his back. "Think you can take me sword<br/>boy?"<p>"I will not be defeated!" cried Mousse as several more weapons<br/>shot from his sleeves.<p>"Never bring a knife to a gunfight!" snapped Ranma as he ducked<br/>under the strikes and fired two clean shots.<p>Mousse froze, he slumped down against one of the video games and<br/>shuddered, shock evident in his eyes. Two holes appeared on either<br/>side of his head, and his glasses fell away from his face from where<br/>they had broken on the edges of the frames.<p>"Next time, I won't aim to miss," said Ranma as he twirled the<br/>weapons around on his fingers as he replaced them in their holsters.<br/>He ducked quickly, and the sound of metal being unsheathed filled the<br/>silence that had suddenly appeared in the room. Shampoo froze with her<br/>bonbori held over her head just behind him. The blade of a rather<br/>large knife was pointed at the nape of her neck. "Ah, ah, ah!" said<br/>Ranma as he wagged his finger at her playfully.<p>The Amazon girl growled and slowly lowered her weapons.<p>"I suggest you give up on me, there are forces at work that you<br/>can't hope to beat," said Ranma as he stepped away from the pair. "And<br/>I don't mean me." He calmly walked through the new entrance to the<br/>arcade that the two Chinese had made when they entered and vanished<br/>into the shadows.<p>Both of the teens looked out the window at the flashing blue<br/>lights that quickly approached.<p>"Mousse," snapped Shampoo as she left the room.<p>The boy shook his head and tucked what remained of his glasses<br/>into his shirt.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"Are you sure this is wise with Shampoo running around?" said Dan.<p>"Of course, I'd rather deal with her than those cops," said Carrot<br/>as he dumped a bucket of water over their head.<p>"Great! What the hell are those two doing here?" snapped Ranma<br/>angrily.<p>The whole group froze when they felt something poke at their back.<p>++++++++++<p>"Well, I had no idea we were looking for the same person, son in<br/>law," chuckled Cologne as she hopped back away from the redhead nimbly<br/>as the young girl spun around to face her. "Quite a fine specimen,"<br/>commented the old woman as she poked her again.<p>"Who are you?" said Ranma coolly as she backed away.<p>"Me? No one in particular, we'll meet again. By then you'll be<br/>begging me to marry Shampoo," said the old woman as she hopped up onto<br/>the rooftops and vanished into the night.<p>++++++++++<p>"Who was that?" said Ranma angrily.<p>"Cologne, Shampoo's great grandmother," said Carrot.<p>"Shit," grumbled Dan irritably.<p>"Well, now the fun really starts," said Carrot with a small<br/>chuckle. "Come on, let's go back."<p>"Right," said Ranma with a sigh.<p>They walked calmly into the growing crowd in front of the arcade<br/>and blended in, vanishing.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Sir, Diamos, they're everywhere," said a small man dressed in a<br/>military uniform. He stood in front of the gigantic kilt clad general<br/>with a look of fear in his eyes.<p>"Aye, I can see that lad," said Genaku as he looked at the display<br/>screen in front of him. They were standing on the deck of a large<br/>destroyer class ship. "Admiral Jadeite?"<p>A man in a gray uniform frowned from a nearby chair and leaned in<br/>slightly. "Has the gate been compromised?"<p>On a the huge screen a pair of small planetoids appeared on the<br/>screen. One a lush green moon, slightly smaller than the tiny white<br/>planet that it orbited.<p>"We believe so, sir," said the reporting officer.<p>"Not good," said Genaku as his scowl deepened.<p>"How many civilians?" said the Admiral with a slight smirk forming<br/>on his face.<p>"Diamos has no civilians living on it," replied Genaku with a<br/>chuckle. "'Tis a military moon, like Pluto. Only a few dignitaries an<br/>scientist are permitted on these planets. The Gates of Time and Space<br/>are too dangerous ta allow a population."<p>"Admiral Jadeite?" said one of the techs as he looked at the man<br/>for a moment.<p>"Prepare the cannons for a planetary razing," said Jadeite calmly.<p>"Aye," agreed Genaku. "Prepare mah men, we're gonna unleash hell<br/>itself." He turned and walked towards the lift.<p>"I'll see you when you return, general," said Jadeite with a<br/>slight nod.<p>"Aye, that ye will," said Genaku as he continued to stroll away.<p>++++++++++<p>"The Gate of Space is ours," said one of the soldiers as he knelt<br/>before his master. "The last of the defenses have fallen." The man was<br/>dressed in a black uniform, with a bright yellow fist insignia on the<br/>right breast.<p>"Excellent," said the armor-clad man who nodded to the man. He was<br/>wearing black European style armor, including the helmet that covered<br/>his head completely. A large black broadsword was in his grasp, and he<br/>casually sliced a prisoner that was held beside him by two more black<br/>clad soldiers. "Soon the Moon will fall, and the entire galaxy will be<br/>ours."<p>"The fleet overhead is preparing their cannons to fire," said one<br/>of the nearby men.<p>"Who is in command of the invading force?" said the armor-clad man<br/>calmly. "The defense shields will hold out as long as we need them<br/>too."<p>"General Genaku," said the man calmly with a smirk on his face.<p>"Excellent, aim all of the planetary defenses at Pluto," said the<br/>commander with a small chuckle. "He will bow to us before he lets us<br/>destroy the Senshi of Pluto and her planet."<p>++++++++++++<p>"Genaku, the planetary defenses are changing their target. They've<br/>targeted Pluto directly." Jadeite frowned deeply as he looked at the<br/>calm face of his old friend staring back at him.<p>"Eh? So what?" snorted the man casually.<p>"Pluto's defenses cannot hold out against an attack like that, it<br/>will be destroyed."<p>"And he thinks he can persuade me not ta attack because of this?"<br/>said Genaku with a small snort. "Mah Marines can take down that<br/>fortress before they can destroy it. I assure ya, now proceed with the<br/>plan."<p>"But the Senshi of Pluto is still..."<p>"Very well aware of what's about ta happen. She is the Senshi of<br/>Time, ain't she?" said Genaku coldly. "Admiral, fire the cannons to<br/>clear our path for entry."<p>"Yah here that men? All of Pluto is depending on us to win this<br/>battle! What have ya got ta say about that?" he roared over his<br/>shoulder.<p>A roar of battle cries echoed throughout the ship, Jadeite could<br/>see the crowd behind Genaku raising their weapons into the air<br/>enthusiastically. He chuckled and turned towards the gunnery officer.<br/>"Fire at will Commander."<p>++++++++++++<p>"What the hell is he doing?" snapped Pluto as she stared into the<br/>screen.<p>"This can't be!" said the scientist who stood next to her. "The<br/>Time Gate told us that he'd bow, and then the Martian forces would<br/>push them back! We'd have it all back within a month's time!"<p>"Genaku!" snarled Pluto angrily. Her mind worked as she attempted<br/>to find some sort of reason. The Time Gate showed how to manipulate<br/>events, but Genaku somehow had the ability to change things to his own<br/>will. "How does he do this?" she snarled.<p>"We could be destroyed!" cried another scientist.<p>"Put me through to that moron!" snarled Pluto.<p>"He's cut off communications from us," said another of the men in<br/>the room as he turned away from the console he was working at.<p>"What?" said Pluto.<p>"All we're getting is this," said the man as he moved aside to<br/>show her the screen.<p>Pluto felt her blood run cold as she saw the screen staring back<br/>at her. It was a picture of Genaku's butt, mooning her. She put her<br/>hand to her head as an intense pain formed there, and screamed in<br/>rage.<p>+++++++++++<p>The sky overhead was alight with flashes as the barrage from the<br/>fleet slammed into the shields that surrounded the small planetoid.<br/>Around twenty huge troop carriers maneuvered to the ground, unmolested<br/>by any attack. They landed in a swarm, great tan hulls that looked<br/>like pregnant aircraft, each holding hundreds of troops within.<p>The armor-clad soldier stood in front of rows and rows of his men<br/>as the military drop ships landed in front of him. All of them were<br/>standing at attention, like some sort of massive military parade. The<br/>commander chuckled and cried out to the lead ship, which was no more<br/>than twenty feet in front of them.<p>"Genaku! I have come to accept your surrender! Give up now, and<br/>Pluto and its Senshi will be spared. Perhaps your men would like to<br/>survive as well!" A roar of laughter erupted from the masses of<br/>soldiers behind him. "There is no one here to help you, and you have<br/>but five thousand men. I have twice that number, the battle is lost!"<p>The door of the lead ship opened. Genaku calmly strolled out and<br/>stood in front of the opposing army, his sword sheathed at his side.<p>"So, you accept my terms?" said the Commander calmly as he stepped<br/>forward.<p>"Who are ye?" snapped Genaku.<p>"I am Yumato, New General of Light, and soon to be ruler of all<br/>the galaxy," said the armor-clad man proudly.<p>"The only thing ye'll be rulin is hell!" roared Genaku as he<br/>raised his sword into the air and charged forward.<p>"What?" said Yumato in shock. His men stood in dumb surprise for a<br/>moment, scrambling to raise their weapons as men poured out of the<br/>ships behind Genaku, charging forward. They were firing into the rows<br/>of black clad soldiers as soon as their feet hit the surface of the<br/>planet, some before then.<p>Yumato raised his sword and staggered back as Genaku slammed into<br/>him, hacking down. The armor-clad man was almost forced to his knees<br/>from the blow, and had to move his weapon madly in order to block the<br/>mad slashing of the General. "You're crazy!"<p>"Pluto won't be destroyed, if ya cannot give the order ta destroy<br/>it!" roared Genaku as he continued to hack and forced the man back.<br/>His swings were wide, and many of the black clad soldiers fell around<br/>him as he pushed the armor-clad warrior further back.<p>The forces of the Moon Kingdom were dressed in bulkily clad tan<br/>uniforms, shoulder pads and rifles were present on most of them as<br/>they continued to rush into the crowd. The initial barrage had sent<br/>the black clad warriors into a state of disarray. The first two rows<br/>of soldiers had fallen before they had even reached their front lines.<p>Now, the Interplanetary Marine forces were fighting in close<br/>combat, against two to one odds. Several of the Marines slowly<br/>approached near the back of their ranks. They lifted large tube like<br/>cannons onto their shoulders and began to fire into the air.<p>Balls of flaming energy soared into the air, and came down in the<br/>back of the ranks, exploding and taking out dozens of the soldiers<br/>with each blast. It also slowed the retreat of the enemy.<p>Genaku was standing in the middle of the enemy soldier's ranks,<br/>fighting with their commander, and none of the black clad men had even<br/>tried to fire at him. The whole mass of men was in a panic,<br/>desperately trying to hold back the forces pushing into them.<p>"Ha!" snarled Genaku as he slashed down, cutting a huge chunk of<br/>metal off the man's shoulder.<p>"Damn you! Kill him you idiots!" snarled the man as he performed<br/>an upward slash that blocked a strike and forced the general to step<br/>back.<p>Finally, one of the men seemed to snap out of his stupor and<br/>turned with a blaster in his hand. He fired at Genaku, who merely<br/>jumped back. One of the black clad soldiers fell on the other side of<br/>the clearing the men were giving.<p>Genaku stabbed back with his sword without looking back, the<br/>strike cut deep into the man's chest, and he started after the enemy<br/>commander. The man had run away as soon as Genaku was forced to stop<br/>attacking him.<p>His own forces seemed to surround him all at once, easily cutting<br/>the larger forces into sections as they fired their way through them.<p>"Sir!" said one of the men who kneeled into a firing position next<br/>to him.<p>"Did ya see which way that coward went?" said the general calmly<br/>as he used the hilt of his blade to slam into one of the enemy's face.<br/>The man dropped like a rock and did not move.<p>"East sir, we're tracking him now. He's heading into one of the<br/>buildings with a few of his men.<p>"The planetary defense controls," said Genaku with a small nod.<p>"Where is the place?" he said calmly.<p>"Over there," said the Marine as he pointed at a large set of<br/>buildings.<p>"Where are the pounders?" said Genaku with a smirk forming on his<br/>face.<p>"Still taking up the rear," said the soldier as he fired a few<br/>more shots into the quickly retreating crowd of black clad soldiers.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Sir!" said the officer in charge as Genaku approached the row of<br/>men armed with the long tube-like weapons.<p>"See those buildings?" said Genaku as he pointed at them.<p>"Yes sir," said the man with a grin forming on his face.<p>"Aye, ye know what ta do," said the red-haired general as he<br/>strolled back to the battle.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Yumato stood in shocked silence as he stared at the smoking<br/>remains of the building in front of him. "No! It can't be!" He turned<br/>and growled angrily at the swarm of tan uniforms on the battlefield a<br/>few hundred yards away. The black uniforms no longer swallowed them<br/>up. "He blew up the command center!"<p>"What are we going to do!" said one of the nearby men in panic.<p>Yumato hacked him in two in a fit of frustrated anger. "We're<br/>going to destroy him!"<p>"How do ye plan to do that?" said a familiar voice. The small<br/>group of soldiers turned to see the intimidating and blood-soaked form<br/>of Genaku staring down at them from the top of a hill.<p>"Kill him!" snarled Yumato bitterly.<p>The men raised their rifles up and aimed at Genaku. Yumato headed<br/>towards a nearby building that was still mostly intact.<p>Genaku moved unlike anything the men had ever seen. He dodged<br/>around their shots easily, hacking into them and quickly tearing<br/>through the men.<p>Finally, three of them remained and stared at the man in horror.<br/>He looked like some sort of blood soaked god of death. They dropped<br/>their rifles and took off screaming in terror.<p>"Feh, cowards," snorted the man casually. He followed Yumato into<br/>the building. Inside he found a long hallway with a row of lights<br/>overhead and no doors.<p>"The fighting is over sir," said a voice from the small metal<br/>insignia on the scarf that ran across his shoulder.<p>"Already?" snorted Genaku in what seemed to be disappointment.<p>"The reinforcements are arriving from the south. We didn't even<br/>need them," said the voice on the other side of the line with a small<br/>chuckle.<p>"Reinforcements?" said the black clad figure that stepped out into<br/>the middle of the hall.<p>"Aye, I also brought ten thousand men with me," said Genaku as he<br/>stared the man down for a moment. "Unfortunately, yer men were no<br/>match fer five of mine. So they didn't get to join in. I had planned<br/>to flank ye."<p>Yumato staggered back. "That's not possible! We never detected..."<p>"Mercury has some amazing technology ya know, best in the entire<br/>solar system. 'Tis a wonder they never came up with a way to hide from<br/>the detection systems of a planet, is it not?" said Genaku with a<br/>small chuckle.<p>"You're too late, I've opened a gateway to my home world. The Gate<br/>of Space will soon dump a million men onto this planet, and they will<br/>crush you and your forces. You've lost general." Yumato pointed at the<br/>man with his sword.<p>Genaku narrowed his eyes at the man. His helmet hid his face, and<br/>he could not detect fear in his voice.<p>"I'll just have ta make sure ya never get ta enjoy yer victory<br/>then," he said as he raised his sword.<p>Yumato stepped back as the enraged general charged, hacking at<br/>him. They exchanged blows in the middle of the hallway and backed<br/>slowly into the main chamber that was at the end.<p>Genaku frowned when he saw the large gateway, a glowing blue light<br/>had formed in its center. The man wasn't lying. He grunted with effort<br/>and hacked a huge gash into the man's side, cutting through the armor<br/>like it wasn't there.<p>Yumato cried out in pain and fell down to his knees. Blood poured<br/>through the open wound and pooled on the floor around him.<p>"Do ya feel it?" said Genaku as he stared down at her. "The<br/>boiling in your blood?"<p>"I will destroy you!" snarled the man as he jumped to his feet and<br/>stabbed at Genaku.<p>The man took a slash from blade in his belly and slammed the hilt<br/>of his own sword into the armored man's helmet. It flew off of<br/>Yumato's face and clattered across the ground.<p>"Damn you," snapped a very different voice as the man stood up and<br/>glared at Genaku harshly.<p>"A woman," said the general in shock.<p>"I will be Empress of the Galaxy!" she snarled as she raised her<br/>sword again. Behind her, the shadowy figure of her reinforcements<br/>began to slowly materialize in the light of the Space Gate.<p>"Yer wound is gone," noted Genaku calmly.<p>"I cannot die!" she snarled as she charged forward while slashing<br/>wildly.<p>Genaku calmly slammed her in the face with the hilt of his blade<br/>again sending her sprawling out on the floor again. "Hurts more<br/>without armor, eh?" He said with a small chuckle.<p>"I cannot lose!" she gasped as she looked up at him hatefully,<br/>unable to move from the pain.<p>"Ya already have," said Genaku calmly. "There can be only one."<p>"What?" said the woman as her eyes went wide. The man had is sword<br/>raised over his head.<p>The last thing she saw was the blade descending down on her.<p>Genaku screamed as energy crackled across the room. Screens<br/>shattered and lights exploded as the woman's energy escaped her body<br/>all at once. He was lifted off the ground by the force of the power<br/>and was then thrown back down to the ground. He fell too his knees,<br/>gasping for breath as the energy slowly and painfully died down around<br/>him.<p>Slowly, he staggered to his feet and looked up at the Space Gate.<br/>The first group of men was slowly walking through, glancing at his<br/>surroundings. Genaku readied his sword, and narrowed his eyes as<br/>dozens more came through behind the man. They saw him lying over the<br/>dead body of their commander, and began to raise their weapons.<p>"Shit," he as he touched the communications device on his<br/>shoulder. "Back to the drop ships, evacuate the planet."<p>"Sir?" said a questioning voice on the other side.<p>"Do it," said Genaku sharply. The first shot passed by him<br/>harmlessly, and was quickly followed by others as still more men<br/>appeared in the room.<p>His sword began to grow red as a magical power began to form<br/>inside the metal. "I'm afraid I'm gonna to ask ya to return home. Ya<br/>weren't invited!" He slashed down with the blade, sending a wide arc<br/>of energy slamming into the gate.<p>The frame shook for a moment, and then cracked. Finally, the<br/>entire doorway shattered. The black clad men stood in shocked horror<br/>as they stared at the remains of the doorway for a moment. Then, the<br/>blue light that was once contained inside began to expand slowly.<p>Genaku turned and started running out the hallway towards the<br/>door.<p>++++++++++++<p>Jadeite stared out into space, watching the growing light form on<br/>the surface of the planet. It slowly grew larger and larger, engulfing<br/>the surface as it slowly spread. The drop ships could be seen<br/>approaching the fleet at high speed and were being let back inside the<br/>bays.<p>"Genaku, what have you done?" he said in horrified shock.<p>Red lines began to spider web along the surface of the planet, slowly<br/>spreading across it. "Load those ships now! Get us the hell out of<br/>here!" he screamed onto the bridge. "Hurry it up! Do it now! As soon<br/>as the ships are loaded!"<p>+++++++++++++<p>In the silence of space, the shattering explosion sent shock waves<br/>across the emptiness. Diamos shattered and was blown to oblivion in an<br/>instant as the ships moved away across the sea of stars.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Pluto stared at the screen in horror as the moon exploded. Rage<br/>slowly built up inside her. She lifted her hands into the air and<br/>screamed.<p>++++++++++<p>"Ya said yourself that the Space Gate did not have its own Senshi,<br/>and was a liability. It had no defense against attacks other than the<br/>planetary defense. Now, it tis no longer a liability," said Genaku as<br/>he stood before Serenity.<p>"He destroyed the Space Gate, and you rewarded him for it!"<br/>snarled Pluto bitterly.<p>"He prevented an invasion, and saved countless lives," said the<br/>queen calmly. "The Space Gate also had no practical value. It was an<br/>open doorway for us to conquer with, and had no defensive value. Now<br/>the temptation will be gone for future rulers."<p>Pluto's jaw dropped, her entire face turned completely red as rage<br/>boiled up inside her.<p>Serenity gave a slight smile. "I realize that your duties have<br/>been<br/>cut in half, and I'm sure you can find ways to fill your time." Her<br/>smile spoke in volumes.<p>Pluto went from an angry red, to a pale white in an instant.<br/>"What?"<p>"Maybe it's time you started looking for a husband?" wondered the<br/>Queen out loud.<p>Pluto knew what that meant, "Find a husband, or I'll do it for<br/>you."<p>Genaku chuckled and shook his head. "I give ya my leave," he said with a<br/>low bow as he strolled out of the room.<p>+++++++++<p>TBC...<p>BTW. In case your interested, this was written to the Gladiator<br/>soundtrack. The battle in the beginning of the movie.<br/>Everyone kept asking me what Genaku did to get Pluto so pissed,<br/>well, this is part of it, and now you know. Next time, the Amazons.<p>
