</div>Insertion<p>Part 78<p>Jusendo<p>+++++++++<p>Carrot stood with his companions<br/>with his arms crossed in front of his<br/>chest and a smirk on his face. "Well,<br/>there it is." They were hiding behind a<br/>large set of boulders, looking up at the<br/>mountain in front of them.<p>"Jusendo," growled Herb as he<br/>lowered his head slightly. "Saffron will<br/>be inside."<p>"Yes, and so will Dan," agreed<br/>Carrot.<p>"Why would he do such a terrible<br/>thing? I thought he was your friend,"<br/>said Usagi as she looked at her parents<br/>for a moment.<p>"Dan was hardly a friend, but in any<br/>case, he's doing this over a woman,"<br/>replied Carrot.<p>"I thought you said something about<br/>brainwashing eggs," snorted Yohiko<br/>irritably.<p>"I did, but if you remember, Dan has<br/>a safeguard against something like that.<br/>He's on his own, and Kiima doesn't<br/>control him," replied Carrot calmly.<p>"Are you sure?" asked Plum in<br/>confusion.<p>"Yeah, I don't think he'd be acting<br/>the way he was if he'd been caught by<br/>one of those eggs," said Carrot.<p>"He's dangerous," said Yohiko as she<br/>turned to look at the others for a<br/>moment. Focusing more on Usagi than<br/>anyone else.<p>"He won't hurt her, or us. Not yet<br/>anyway," said Carrot. "He's mine, and<br/>he's waiting for me. I doubt if he'll<br/>seriously try to stop us, he wants this<br/>fight as bad as I do."<p>"Waiting on you?" asked Herb.<p>Carrot nodded. "That doesn't mean<br/>he's not dangerous, possibly more than<br/>Saffron even. I'm sure I can win, but<br/>he's got some nasty surprises waiting<br/>for us I'm sure."<p>"He's been hanging around you too<br/>long," said Yohiko with a rough snort.<p>"You're absolutely right," said<br/>Xellos as he appeared next to them.<p>"Hey Pop," said Phibrizzo<br/>cheerfully.<p>"I was starting to wonder when you<br/>two would show up," commented Carrot as<br/>he turned to face the pair.<p>"You again?" asked Ukyo.<p>Ryoga frowned, but didn't move from<br/>his place behind Plum.<p>"Yes, us again," said Xellos<br/>cheerfully. "In any case, they're<br/>waiting on you inside. It won't be easy<br/>to get where you're going."<p>"I know, Dan is smarter than I<br/>usually give him credit for, plus I'm<br/>not sure how he operates on his own.<br/>I've got a pretty good feeling that<br/>there won't be much of Jusendo left<br/>after we're through with it." Carrot<br/>scowled and turned to face the others.<br/>"He's mine, don't try to fight him. You<br/>worry about getting me in there, I'll<br/>handle Dan and Saffron."<p>Yohiko frowned at this. "Both of<br/>them?"<p>"Fool, you'll get yourself killed!"<br/>snapped Herb.<p>"Maybe so," agreed Carrot as he<br/>nodded in agreement.<p>Yohiko frowned at this and stared at<br/>him. "That's the whole idea isn't it?"<p>"What? Dying?" said Carrot with a<br/>small chuckle. "Don't be absurd. I<br/>already know how to beat Saffron. Dan is<br/>too much for anyone but me to handle.<br/>I'm your only choice."<p>"What do you mean?" snapped Herb<br/>angrily. "Defeating Saffron on your own?<br/>Don't be absurd!"<p>"Actually, I agree with him. He's<br/>the only one who should face Saffron.<br/>Dan however...is another matter<br/>entirely." Xellos turned to face Carrot<br/>again and chuckled. "If you fight Dan,<br/>you won't be in any condition for<br/>Saffron. The same goes for if you take<br/>on the God first. Either way, if you try<br/>to do everything, you'll die. Face it,<br/>you can't protect them this time<br/>Carrot."<p>The man stared at Xellos and scowled<br/>angrily. His jaw went hard and he<br/>growled irritably.<p>"Protect us?" asked Yohiko as she<br/>stared at Xellos for a moment.<p>"Yes, protect you. Especially you,<br/>Miss Yohiko," replied Phibrizzo as he<br/>smirked at her.<p>"Heh. I wonder how much he knows?"<br/>replied Xellos calmly.<p>"She can take care of herself,"<br/>snapped Carrot as he turned away<br/>angrily.<p>"Yes she can, but that's not what<br/>you're worried about is it?" asked<br/>Xellos as his maddening grin challenged<br/>Carrot's angry frown.<p>"Shut your hole Xellos," growled the<br/>man.<p>"What is he talking about?" said<br/>Usagi in confusion. "Dad?"<p>"It's nothing," grumbled Carrot as<br/>he turned away.<p>Yohiko was standing in silence<br/>staring at Carrot with an unreadable<br/>expression on her face. Finally she<br/>snorted and turned away. "I don't need<br/>your help. I can take any one of you!<br/>You know that!"<p>Carrot didn't look at her and<br/>growled under his breath. "It's not you<br/>I'm worried about Yohiko, it's them."<p>"We knew what we were getting into<br/>when we came here," said Herb firmly. "I<br/>for one do not appreciate being treated<br/>as a weak fool."<p>"Think what you want, Saffron is<br/>mine," said Carrot as he returned Herb's<br/>glare. "You can have him, but only if we<br/>find him before he transforms.<br/>Understood?" His voice was commanding<br/>and firm.<p>Herb frowned at this and grit his<br/>teeth in irritation. "You..."<p>"Give me your word, or I'll make<br/>sure you can't get in my way Herb. If<br/>he's transformed, you back off and let<br/>me handle it."<p>It was a clear-cut threat. Herb<br/>looked at Ryoga and Ukyo, both of them<br/>were in shock and appeared to back him<br/>up rather than Carrot. "It is my duty to<br/>face him."<p>"Even if it means you'd have to<br/>leave your Queen in charge of your<br/>people? Do you really trust Ranma that<br/>much?" asked Xellos calmly as he stepped<br/>between them.<p>"He is my mate!" snarled Herb in<br/>defiance.<p>"She is inexperienced as a ruler,<br/>and her temper will get the best of her.<br/>Do you really think she will obey you if<br/>you die? Or will she try to avenge your<br/>death, possibly dragging her people to<br/>their doom along with her?" said<br/>Phibrizzo coolly as he smirked at Herb<br/>and stood beside Xellos. "She'll follow<br/>her heart, and that is exactly what it<br/>will tell her to do."<p>Herb stood firmly glaring at them.<br/>"Very well. You have my word." He bowed<br/>his head and turned away.<p>Ukyo was silent and stood back with<br/>Ryoga and Plum. None of the teens knew<br/>what was happening. Usagi was next to<br/>her mother and didn't know what to think<br/>or do.<p>"Good, don't forget it," said Carrot<br/>as he stood up and stepped out into the<br/>open. "Xellos, are you just here to play<br/>referee, or are you going to be useful<br/>for once?"<p>Plum rushed over and grabbed the leg<br/>of Carrot's pants. "We don't know which<br/>entrance it is! We could be killed!"<p>"I know that, but Xellos knows the<br/>right entrance," said Carrot as he<br/>turned his gaze towards the pair of<br/>Mazoku.<p>"Very well, I suppose I can help<br/>this time," said Xellos with a small<br/>sigh. "Don't expect much more from me<br/>though."<p>"Right," said Carrot with a smug<br/>looking grin on his face. "Now, to the<br/>plan."<p>"What plan?" asked Yohiko irritably.<p>"What? Charge in and beat them up,<br/>right?" asked Usagi dumbly.<p>"No, you're going to handle Kiima<br/>Usagi. Don't kill her though, Dan won't<br/>be any easier to deal with if we piss<br/>him off that way. Just keep her out of<br/>the way."<p>"Me?" asked Yohiko with a frown on<br/>her face.<p>"You and Herb are both going to keep<br/>Dan busy while I deal with Saffron,"<br/>replied Carrot coolly.<p>"What about us?" snorted Ukyo<br/>irritably.<p>"You and Ryoga are going to take<br/>care of any guards we find on the way,<br/>you're here to clear the way. Stay out<br/>of the big fights, they're beyond your<br/>power levels."<p>"What am I doing?" muttered Plum.<p>"You're going home, when we find<br/>your father, we'll send him after you.<br/>You'll just get in the way at this<br/>point. We can't waste time protecting<br/>you. Sorry."<p>Plum actually looked relieved.<br/>"Okay, come back to Jusenkyo when<br/>finished then."<p>"Don't worry kid, we won't leave you<br/>hanging," said Ryoga cheerfully.<p>"Why should we do what you tell us<br/>too?" snorted Yohiko.<p>"Because it's a good plan actually,"<br/>replied Xellos with a small shrug.<p>"Who asked you!" snapped the woman<br/>angrily.<p>"Saffron is mine if he's not<br/>transformed," said Herb coldly. "Don't<br/>forget that."<p>"Fine, have it your way," replied<br/>Carrot. "In any case, no matter what<br/>happens, Ryoga stays with Ukyo. Keep him<br/>from getting lost. He won't do us any<br/>good if he wanders off in the fight."<p>The chef nodded firmly and turned to<br/>glare at the boy irritably.<p>"I have to fight the bird lady?"<br/>muttered Usagi fearfully.<p>"She's no match for you if you<br/>remember your training," replied Carrot<br/>calmly. "Besides, I just want you to<br/>make sure she stays out of the way more<br/>than anything else. Don't forget, you<br/>can't let her die. Dan will not be<br/>pleased if she's dead, and I'm not sure<br/>if any of us can survive that maniac if<br/>he becomes suicidal."<p>"You underestimate my power,"<br/>growled Herb.<p>"Whatever," growled Yohiko.<p>"Enough of this!" growled Herb.<p>"Stop bickering and shut up. We<br/>don't have time for arguments," said<br/>Carrot.<p>"I can handle Dan on my own if I<br/>need too! I don't need his help!" said<br/>Yohiko irritably.<p>"Come on, let's just go," growled<br/>Carrot as he started walking towards the<br/>entrance. "Which one is it anyway?"<p>Xellos chuckled and merely pointed<br/>at a door with the words 'Employees<br/>Only' written on it.<p>"Oh. Right," said Carrot with a<br/>small shrug.<p>+++++++++++<p>The caverns and passageways of<br/>Jusendo were quiet, and empty. Darkness<br/>surrounded them, and the sound of<br/>dripping water could occasionally be<br/>heard as the group entered the mountain<br/>through the doorway.<p>Herb frowned slightly and closed his<br/>eyes with his palm held in front of him.<br/>"I shall light our way." A ball of<br/>energy appeared in his hand and the room<br/>lit up. "Come."<p>"Stop showing off," said Carrot as<br/>he smacked the man in the back of his<br/>head as he passed by. He turned on a<br/>flashlight he'd pulled from his backpack<br/>and pulled something off of the bottom,<br/>turning it into a small electric<br/>lantern.<p>"You didn't tell me you had one of<br/>those," grumbled Herb irritably as he<br/>followed and dissipated the ki ball.<p>"Sure is quiet," commented Usagi.<p>"Yeah, too quiet," agreed Carrot as<br/>he narrowed his eyes and led the group<br/>through the tunnel.<p>After several minutes of wandering<br/>in silence, the group came upon a deep<br/>cavern. It extended in either direction,<br/>but above and below them. Various<br/>tunnels and passageways were visible<br/>through holes in the wall, along with<br/>several natural bridges.<p>"There's no one here," commented<br/>Carrot irritably as he looked up and<br/>down. "We should have run into someone<br/>by now. Something is wrong."<p>"Perhaps they are all in the central<br/>chamber?" muttered Herb out loud.<p>"No, they would have guards<br/>patrolling, something. This isn't<br/>something they want interrupted,"<br/>replied Carrot with a frown on his face.<br/>"This isn't right. I've got a bad<br/>feeling about this."<p>"You said it," agreed Ryoga. Ukyo<br/>tugged on his arm and prevented him from<br/>stepping off the side of the natural<br/>bridge they were walking across.<p>"Well, we can only go forward," said<br/>Yohiko with a small shrug. Carrot was<br/>bothering her, she knew about his past<br/>life. He should know what they should<br/>expect in this place. He looked nervous<br/>and confused, that bothered her more<br/>than anything else.<p>Finally, the tunnel ended. They<br/>walked into a room and everyone but<br/>Carrot looked on in awe at the statues<br/>that loomed in the center of the room<br/>over a pool. A dragon and a phoenix,<br/>both with their mouths opened. The two<br/>great statues were joined at the base,<br/>forming a single pipe near the bottom of<br/>the cavern.<p>"This is it," said Carrot. "They<br/>should be here."<p>"We are here," said a familiar<br/>voice.<p>The group looked up at the ceiling<br/>and gasped. Hanging upside-down on the<br/>ceiling above them were no less than a<br/>hundred of the birdmen. All of them had<br/>automatic weapons in their hands pointed<br/>down at them.<p>"Hello Carrot," said Dan. He was in<br/>the center of the group and his wings<br/>spread wide as he flipped off with his<br/>comrades. They floated down around them,<br/>keeping the weapons trained on them.<p>"I should have expected something<br/>like this from you," said Carrot with a<br/>small sigh.<p>"Yeah, you should have," agreed Dan<br/>casually as he chuckled to himself.<p>"What the hell?" cried Ryoga.<p>"Damn," growled Herb as he realized<br/>there was no way even he could survive<br/>such an onslaught. He relaxed his stance<br/>and stood upright. "It seems you have<br/>us."<p>"Excellent," chuckled Kiima as she<br/>appeared out of the group and walked up<br/>next to Dan.<p>"Really, they should know better<br/>than to bring their fists to a<br/>gunfight," commented Dan.<p>Masara and Koruma stood beside their<br/>Captain, both holding their firearms<br/>lazily and carelessly.<p>"Kill them," said Kiima.<p>"No, I've got a better idea," said<br/>Dan.<p>The woman looked at him in shock.<p>"If they start firing their weapons<br/>now, they'll kill their comrades,"<br/>commented Carrot. "You've got us<br/>surrounded."<p>"He's right," said Dan. "However, I<br/>want him, and we can give Herb to<br/>Saffron as a gift after his<br/>transformation is complete. A fitting<br/>way to start his rule, by killing the<br/>Musk King himself."<p>"You're right," said Kiima with a<br/>sly looking grin on her face. "We'll<br/>detain them for now."<p>Dan smirked at her and looked at<br/>Carrot. "He stays here. Him and the<br/>little girl." He pointed to Usagi and<br/>then smirked with an evil looking grin.<p>"Why?"<p>"I've got some personal business to<br/>settle with this one," said Dan coldly.<p>"Very well. Do not let them escape,"<br/>said the woman with a slightly angry<br/>tone to her voice.<p>"Escape is not his plan," said Dan<br/>as he smirked at Carrot.<p>The man nodded and grabbed Usagi's<br/>shoulder. He pulled her up to his side<br/>and stepped over beside his<br/>doppelganger. Kiima started ordering her<br/>troops to move the others away.<p>"Well, you managed to take me by<br/>surprise. I'm impressed Dan," said<br/>Carrot as he smirked at his enemy<br/>coolly.<p>"I figured you would be, I'm<br/>surprised you wouldn't think I'd raid a<br/>nearby military base for weapons."<p>"Seems a bit risky," commented<br/>Carrot. "Loose many men?"<p>"Not one, it was just a supply<br/>building. I doubt if the Chinese<br/>Government even realizes these weapons<br/>are gone yet."<p>"What's going on?" asked Usagi<br/>nervously.<p>"I'm taking you to Saffron, you'll<br/>join him in his rebirth, and Carrot will<br/>face me in combat," said Dan with a cold<br/>looking frown on his face suddenly.<p>"You're making stupid villain<br/>mistakes, but you're doing it on purpose<br/>aren't you?" said Carrot.<p>"Eh?"<p>"Saving someone for the enjoyment of<br/>some super being, taking prisoners<br/>rather than killing us when you have the<br/>advantage, telling me about your plot,<br/>that sort of thing."<p>"That easy to read am I?" chuckled<br/>Dan. "I've got no interest in Saffron,<br/>and I'm perfectly happy with Kiima. I<br/>doubt that will change after you beat<br/>him. Still, I want to settle our score,<br/>and I think this is as good a place as<br/>any to do it."<p>"The bad guy always loses," replied<br/>Carrot.<p>"Who says I'm bad?" asked Dan. "I'm<br/>helping you."<p>"You call this help?" snarled Usagi.<p>"Yes, those guns won't kill either<br/>of us," said Carrot with a smirk on hi<br/>face. "Ryoga, Herb, and Ukyo are a<br/>different story. He's conveniently<br/>getting them out of our hair. Very<br/>thoughtful."<p>"Thanks," said Dan with another<br/>chuckle. "In any case, Yohiko doesn't<br/>need to be getting in our way either.<br/>She might do something stupid, like stop<br/>us before it's over, just to save her<br/>own hide."<p>Carrot nodded.<p>"What are you talking about?"<br/>grumbled Usagi.<p>"It's nothing," replied Carrot.<p>"We're here," said Dan as he pointed<br/>to the pool in front of them. It was<br/>empty still, but Saffron was standing in<br/>the center of it with a smirk on his<br/>face.<p>"What's going on?" grumbled Usagi.<p>"You're being fed to Saffron, as<br/>nourishment for his transformation,"<br/>replied Dan as he stared down at her.<br/>"Don't worry, it only hurts for the<br/>first hour or so."<p>"WHAT!" cried the girl in shock.<p>"You know I can't let you do this<br/>Dan," replied Carrot calmly.<p>"I'm counting on it," chuckled Dan<br/>quietly. "Up top, the staff is on the<br/>dragon's head. You know what to do.<br/>Don't let me down."<p>"Don't worry about that, you and<br/>Kiima make sure you raise him to be a<br/>little better behaved next time,"<br/>replied Carrot as he strolled out into a<br/>ring of guards.<p>"So, this one?" said Saffron as he<br/>looked at the frightened girl who was<br/>being led to him. "She should do fine."<p>"Wait for my signal," said Carrot to<br/>his daughter as she was pulled from his<br/>side. The girl's power dropped a bit and<br/>her clothing stopped it's subtle<br/>shifting.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"Where are they taking us?" asked<br/>Ukyo as she glared at the men<br/>surrounding her. Most of them had their<br/>weapons sitting lazily at their sides.<br/>Unfortunately, if they moved to attack,<br/>the others would react before they could<br/>take them all down. It was a no win<br/>situation.<p>Ten guards were moving them through<br/>a passageway towards where they would<br/>probably be held.<p>"Deeper into the mountain," said<br/>Yohiko with a sort of lazy calm in her<br/>tone. She didn't seem very worried.<br/>"What bothers me more, is that Carrot is<br/>alone with Dan, and my daughter."<p>"Why does that bother you?" asked<br/>Herb as he watched his captors<br/>cautiously. A few of them were rather<br/>lax, but there was enough of them alert<br/>that it kept him restrained.<p>"You don't know Carrot like I do,"<br/>said Yohiko. "He and Dan have been at<br/>each other's throats for as long as I've<br/>known them. They won't restrain from<br/>fighting long."<p>"Where does that leave us?" asked<br/>Ryoga.<p>"On our own," said Yohiko as she<br/>spun around and snagged one of the<br/>weapons. The cavern exploded with<br/>flashes of light and sound as she fired.<p>After several seconds of confusion,<br/>there was silence.<p>"You killed them!" cried Ryoga as he<br/>staggered to his feet. Yohiko was<br/>standing in the middle of the only<br/>remaining clean spot on the floor for as<br/>far as the light let them see. A lantern<br/>lay on the ground, half covered in a red<br/>splatter. Her wings were opened, and<br/>wrapped around the trio protectively<br/>behind her. She snorted and brushed a<br/>few bits of metal off her chest and<br/>pulled the weapon upright.<p>"You're damn right I did," she<br/>replied coldly. "Come on, grab one of<br/>those rifles."<p>"What?" said Herb dumbly.<p>"This isn't a martial arts fight,"<br/>she replied as she shoved one into his<br/>chest. Ukyo was looking at hers in<br/>confusion, she didn't need to be<br/>prompted to pick one up though.<p>Ryoga growled angrily. "I can't use<br/>this."<p>"Take it, or you'll die. Follow my<br/>lead, and do as I say and we'll make it<br/>out of here. We've got to find a way out<br/>of here."<p>"What about Carrot and Usagi?" said<br/>Ukyo as she frowned at the woman.<p>"They're like me, these weapons<br/>won't hurt them," replied Yohiko calmly.<br/>"Stay close to me, I should be able to<br/>protect you from bullets if I have too."<p>"What kind of martial artist..."<br/>grumbled Ryoga as he looked at the<br/>weapon dumbly.<p>"One who's just found himself in the<br/>middle of a war zone. Cock this back,<br/>point and shoot. Make sure your safety<br/>is off, like this, pull this down and<br/>load another clip like this." The woman<br/>demonstrated the simple operation of the<br/>weapons to them and frowned. "We're<br/>going outside for now. I think Dan and<br/>Carrot will join us shortly."<p>"What? Dan is still..."<p>"I know that, but neither of them is<br/>stupid enough to fight inside here.<br/>They'll bring the whole place down on<br/>top of them, and not even one of us can<br/>survive that."<p>Herb frowned and nodded. "How did<br/>you know how too..."<p>"Dan is an old training partner of<br/>mine, this is his preferred way of<br/>fighting," said the woman as she hefted<br/>her weapon onto her shoulder and started<br/>walking.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Hot water poured around Saffron from<br/>the Phoenix tap. He grinned and spread<br/>his arms wide. Fibers started to form<br/>around his body slowly and surround him.<br/>Unfortunately, Usagi was tied up at his<br/>feet. "You'll fuel my transformation<br/>girl. Soon I'll be complete!"<p>Kiima stood just outside the water<br/>with Dan at her side. Carrot watched<br/>calmly for a long moment. The bird<br/>people were backing away.<p>"Usagi, now," he said firmly as he<br/>grabbed one of the passing men by his<br/>shoulder. The birdman's eyes went wide<br/>with shock.<p>Dan turned to look at him and did<br/>nothing as the unfortunate man flew<br/>though the air and slammed into Saffron.<br/>The boy growled angrily as the man<br/>started to struggle against the fibers<br/>that snagged him. He didn't move though,<br/>and allowed it to happen. "Fine, I'll<br/>just destroy you later then."<p>The boy gasped in shock and was<br/>thrown into the water on his back. Usagi<br/>jumped to her feet, tearing free of the<br/>rope that bound her as her clothing<br/>suddenly became a mass of sharp spikes.<br/>She rolled away as the fiber reached for<br/>her and engulfed the unfortunate<br/>servant.<p>"No!" screamed Kiima as she started<br/>to move forward. Masara and Koruma were<br/>in too much shock to speak, after a<br/>moment they shook out of their stupor<br/>and turned their weapons on Carrot.<p>"No," said Dan as he knocked them<br/>away with a casual swat of his wings.<br/>The pair fell on their backs, firing<br/>blindly into the air as the screams of<br/>the trapped man started to grow quieter<br/>as the shell began to harden around<br/>Saffron's body.<p>Usagi was standing at the edge of<br/>the pool staring at it in horrified<br/>shock. "What? What just happened?"<p>Carrot chuckled. "Saffron has<br/>started his rebirth, now that all the<br/>Phoenix people have left, I can wait for<br/>him to hatch."<p>"What?" said his daughter in shock.<p>Kiima was staring at him with her<br/>jaw hanging down. "What is the meaning<br/>of this?"<p>"Heh. That fool Saffron, he doesn't<br/>realize who he's dealing with," replied<br/>Carrot calmly.<p>Dan merely stood in silence.<p>"What's going on?" cried Masara.<br/>"Captain! We have to leave!" The room<br/>was already uncomfortably hot. "We'll be<br/>burnt if we stay!"<p>Koruma pulled on his shoulder and<br/>forced him out of the cavern.<p>"Usagi, are you all right?" asked<br/>Carrot.<p>"What the hell took you so long?"<br/>cried the girl angrily. "I thought that<br/>thing was gonna..."<p>"I wouldn't have let that happen,"<br/>said Dan calmly.<p>Kiima hissed angrily and stared at<br/>Dan. "You tricked me!"<p>"Come on honey, don't be angry,"<br/>said the man as he frowned at her. "As<br/>much as I like you, I'm not going to<br/>feed my friend's daughter to the Phoenix<br/>King."<p>"What?" said Usagi dumbly.<p>She backed away slowly and stared at<br/>them. "What is going on here?"<p>"I'm going to fight Saffron," said<br/>Carrot as he stared at her. "Just not<br/>till he's finished. He's far to weak to<br/>face me now."<p>Dan chuckled at this and smirked.<br/>"Be my guest."<p>"You're a fool then, Saffron will<br/>destroy you!" snarled Kiima. She was<br/>starting to sweat, and Usagi was looking<br/>uncomfortable as well.<p>"We have to get you out of here<br/>Kiima. We'll talk about this later,"<br/>said Dan as he started to pull on her<br/>arm. "He's stupid enough to just stand<br/>there."<p>"He'll be killed!" growled the<br/>woman.<p>"Take Usagi with you," replied<br/>Carrot as he continued to stare at the<br/>egg. His wings were now spread wide<br/>behind his back and he had a cold<br/>looking smirk on his face. "I'm sure the<br/>others have escaped by now."<p>"I wouldn't doubt it," agreed Dan.<p>"What's going on?" asked Usagi as<br/>she stared at the adults in confusion.<p>"That's what I'd like to know!"<br/>cried Kiima angrily as she slapped Dan.<p>"I'm going to fight Saffron, we<br/>already told you," said Carrot calmly.<p>"You don't stand a chance against<br/>him!" snarled Kiima.<p>"Then what are you worried about?"<br/>replied Carrot. "Go on, get out of here.<br/>I'll be fine."<p>"Yeah, right," said Dan with a<br/>chuckle. He grabbed Usagi's arm roughly<br/>and pulled her.<p>"Leggo!" cried the girl as her<br/>costume started to form again.<p>"Go with him, he won't hurt you,"<br/>said Carrot as he continued to stare at<br/>the egg.<p>"But..." started the girl.<p>"You have a lot of explaining to<br/>do!" snarled Kiima as she pulled on<br/>Dan's ear and started to drag him off.<p>"Ouch! Hey!" said the man as he was<br/>pulled into the caverns.<p>Carrot smirked as the egg started to<br/>glow. He looked up at the dragon statue<br/>and then back at the egg and jumped into<br/>the air. Almost casually he landed on<br/>the dragon tap and stared at the staff<br/>in front of him for a long moment.<br/>Reaching out he took it in his hand,<br/>despite the heat from the pool below it<br/>was cold to the touch, and a comforting<br/>wave of cold power surged over his body.<br/>"Heh. I've got the Gekkaja. Now all I<br/>have to do is wait."<p>+++++++++++<p>"Where the hell are we?" oddly<br/>enough, it wasn't Ryoga uttering his<br/>trademark phrase. Yohiko glanced around<br/>the hallway in frustration as she turned<br/>another corner with the well-armed group<br/>of martial artists. Oddly enough, they<br/>had met with no opposition thus far.<p>"It's that pit!" cried Ryoga as he<br/>looked down below. Yohiko snorted as she<br/>did the same and stared into the abyss.<p>"We're going the right way then,<br/>come on. We're going to jump down," she<br/>turned to look at Herb and nodded at<br/>him.<p>The dragon man shook his head. "We<br/>have to go back and stop Saffron."<p>"It's too late," replied Yohiko as<br/>she pointed up.<p>The group gave a collective gasp as<br/>they noticed the birdmen flying above<br/>them. They started pouring out of the<br/>mountain's caverns, all moving up and<br/>away from the scene.<p>"Shit!" cried Ukyo as she aimed her<br/>weapon.<p>Yohiko put up her hand and stopped<br/>her. "No. They aren't bothering with<br/>us." She frowned and watched them ignore<br/>the group in favor of escaping with<br/>their lives. Turning slowly, she noticed<br/>a red glow starting to form in the<br/>hallway behind them. "We should follow<br/>their example, but I doubt if Herb will<br/>make it up there with his powers<br/>carrying one of you."<p>Ryoga and Ukyo stared at each other<br/>for a moment. "What about Usagi?"<p>"Carrot's taking care of that, I<br/>doubt if she'll be hurt," said the woman<br/>as she stared at Herb again. "We have to<br/>leave, there's no choice. We failed to<br/>stop Saffron's transformation. It's too<br/>late."<p>The Dragon man hung his head and<br/>growled. "Fine, we'll see what we can do<br/>from outside."<p>"Right," agreed Yohiko. "Be ready to<br/>fight, our objective is to escape this<br/>mountain. There may be some resistance<br/>outside still." She cocked her weapon<br/>and started forward.<p>"She's scary with that thing,"<br/>commented Ryoga nervously.<p>"Actually, I'd prefer a sidearm,"<br/>replied Yohiko as she turned to look at<br/>him and paused her forward motion. "I'm<br/>used to firing one, this is pretty new<br/>to me."<p>"Yes, but it's definitely more<br/>effective against a group."<p>Yohiko gasped and turned around<br/>fluidly, aiming her weapon ahead of her.<p>Dan was standing with Kiima and<br/>Usagi. "Hello."<p>"You!" growled Ukyo.<p>"Don't bother," snorted Dan. "That<br/>weapon isn't strong enough to hurt me."<p>Kiima looked at him for a moment and<br/>frowned. "We should kill them." She<br/>leveled her own weapon at the group. He<br/>stopped her by shoving the barrel down.<br/>"Don't bother, it's not time for that<br/>just yet."<p>"What? You'll do as I say!" snapped<br/>the woman angrily.<p>"You don't control me, and you never<br/>did," replied Dan calmly. "I chose to go<br/>with you Kiima, I like you. Still, this<br/>group is more trouble than it's worth.<br/>Saffron will deal with them after he<br/>fights Carrot, if he manages to survive<br/>at all."<p>Kiima whirled around and pointed the<br/>gun at his chest, her eyes wide with<br/>shock. "What? That's impossible you<br/>were..."<p>"Was I?" he asked her with a smug<br/>looking grin on his face. "Come on,<br/>don't be that way..." His smirk turned<br/>somewhat gentle and he chuckled. "You<br/>know I'll help you."<p>The woman's face contorted, conflict<br/>clear in her mind. "I..."<p>"Saffron and Carrot is out of my<br/>hands, isn't that right Xellos?"<p>The mage appeared out of the fiery<br/>depths of the cavern. It was growing<br/>uncomfortably warm now. "Yes Dan, I<br/>would have stopped you if you'd tried to<br/>kill him just yet. There's more riding<br/>on this than you realize."<p>"I doubt that, you've got plans for<br/>her. I've figured that much out," he<br/>replied as he motioned his weapon<br/>towards Yohiko. "What it is, I don't<br/>know just yet."<p>"No, not her. She's involved in it.<br/>We want the twins that are gestating<br/>inside her belly. Quite important<br/>really. More than any of you realize. I<br/>think Carrot knows though, but probably<br/>because it was his idea to begin with."<p>"Twins?" gasped Yohiko in shock. She<br/>dropped the weapon to the ground and<br/>stared at him.<p>"Yes, You and Carrot have conceived<br/>a new life, two of them in fact. You'll<br/>understand what I mean soon enough, but<br/>not just yet."<p>The woman stared at him for a long<br/>moment and then looked down at her<br/>belly. "I'm...going to be a mother? A<br/>real mother?"<p>"Hey!" cried Usagi irritably.<p>"Yes, in a manner of speaking,"<br/>replied Xellos calmly.<p>"What does that mean?" she snarled<br/>hatefully at him.<p>"You should leave now, it's time,"<br/>said the Mazoku as he looked up at the<br/>ceiling for a moment. "Oh, what the<br/>heck? Why not?" he said as he waved his<br/>hand. The group was standing in the<br/>forest outside the mountain within the<br/>blink of an eye.<p>"Xellos! Answer me!" snarled Yohiko<br/>as she whirled around angrily. The<br/>monster was gone. "Damn you!"<p>"I'm gonna have, brothers, or<br/>sisters?" asked Usagi dumbly as she<br/>stared at her mother for a moment.<p>The woman punched a nearby tree, and<br/>it fell to the ground after being<br/>uprooted by the force of the blow.<p>Kiima stared at her for a moment<br/>with her jaw hanging down. "What?"<p>"Put that away," said Dan as he took<br/>the weapon from her grip and tossed it<br/>into the forest. "We've got other<br/>concerns."<p>Usagi looked up at him and frowned.<br/>"What do you mean?"<p>"That," said Ukyo as she pointed to<br/>the summit of the mountain. Flames were<br/>erupting from the top of the mountain,<br/>and the sky was becoming dark with ashes<br/>and smoke.<p>"What the?" muttered Dan as he<br/>stared at it. "What's going on?"<p>"It's Saffron's transformation,"<br/>replied Kiima. "In about an hour, he<br/>will emerge, the Phoenix King has arisen<br/>again."<p>"Daddy!" cried Usagi fearfully.<p>"He's fine," replied Yohiko.<p>"No one can survive that!" snapped<br/>Kiima. "Our master is reborn, and we<br/>rule all!"<p>Herb growled and stared at her<br/>angrily. He was outmatched and he knew<br/>it. "All hope is gone. I must prepare to<br/>die."<p>"I doubt that," said Yohiko calmly.<br/>"Carrot knows what he's doing."<p>"I wouldn't be so sure of that,"<br/>replied Dan calmly as he looked away<br/>from the woman. He stared at the<br/>mountaintop and scowled. He remembered<br/>what Saffron's rebirth was like in the<br/>manga story, and this was nothing like<br/>it. He had always assumed that Saffron's<br/>form was completed, but he didn't have<br/>control of his power. It even said that<br/>in the story, now, he wasn't so sure.<br/>"There's no Super Saiyan transformation<br/>to help him this time either."<p>"What are you talking about?" asked<br/>Kiima.<p>"Nothing, it looks like we're going<br/>to win. It's a shame, I wanted to fight<br/>him myself."<p>The woman blinked at him and turned<br/>away. "Come on, we'll deal with these<br/>weaklings later."<p>"Right," agreed Dan as he smirked at<br/>the others. "I'll see you around."<p>Yohiko scowled at them and turned<br/>her back. She looked at her companions<br/>and sighed. "We'd best find a place to<br/>lay low until this is over. Carrot's on<br/>his own, we won't be able to help him.<br/>None of you is strong enough, and I have<br/>more than me to think about now."<p>Ryoga nodded in agreement. "If he's<br/>not dead already." He looked up at the<br/>mountain and scowled. "Good luck."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Fire, a torrent of flames surrounded<br/>him. He stood firmly against it, the<br/>Gekkaja firmly in his grasp as he stared<br/>at the glowing egg. It protected him<br/>from the heat, but it was growing<br/>uncomfortable. Without his clothing to<br/>protect him, he'd have been nothing but<br/>ash, and he knew it. "Something's not<br/>right." It was something of an<br/>understatement.<p>He opened his wings, it was all he<br/>really needed to do. The heat carried<br/>him up and through the new hole in the<br/>ceiling of the cavern. Within a few<br/>seconds he was floating high above Mt.<br/>Phoenix and staring down the glowing<br/>crater below him. The updraft was more<br/>than enough to hold him there. "What the<br/>hell did I do?"<p>"What's wrong? I thought you said<br/>you knew what you were doing?" said<br/>Ranma angrily.<p>"I thought I did. Without us, you<br/>would have fought Saffron's incomplete<br/>form. I always assumed the<br/>transformation was almost completed, and<br/>only lacked a little. It even said<br/>something along those lines. This is way<br/>different than I thought it'd be."<p>"So now what?" cried Ranma<br/>irritably. "What the hell did you do<br/>Carrot?"<p>"I just fucked up majorly Ranma, and<br/>now we've got to deal with it," replied<br/>the voice with a small sigh. "This isn't<br/>going to be as easy as I thought it<br/>would."<p>The mountain below them exploded,<br/>two gigantic wings of flame burst<br/>through the solid rock, and sent showers<br/>of stones in every direction.<p>"No shit," replied Ranma coolly.<p>"So, ready for a real fight Ranma?"<br/>said Carrot with a smirk forming on his<br/>face.<p>"You sound like you're enjoying<br/>this," replied Ranma irritably.<p>"Well, we're the devil after all,<br/>now we get to fight a real god," said<br/>Carrot as he chuckled a little. "I say<br/>we kick his ass."<p>"He just blew up a mountain by<br/>waking up," replied Ranma.<p>"So? He's a little cranky?" quipped<br/>Carrot. "Let's hope he's not a morning<br/>person."<p>"Right," grumbled Ranma.<p>"Get ready, it's coming," warned<br/>Carrot as he steeled himself.<p>A huge bird-like cry echoed through<br/>the valley. Saffron's gigantic fiery<br/>wings flapped once and a huge flaming<br/>bird rose from the center of the<br/>mountain. It had a five hundred-foot<br/>wingspan, and was easily as long. The<br/>bird seemed to be completely made out of<br/>flames as it rose into the air and moved<br/>up beside them.<p>Ranma and Carrot growled as<br/>something became clear in the center of<br/>the fire. A man was seemingly sleeping<br/>inside the thing, his own wings folded<br/>on his back and his hands in a<br/>meditative position in front of his<br/>chest. Slowly, he started to smile and<br/>opened his eyes. "Hello."<p>"Don't demons usually lose?"<br/>grumbled Ranma.<p>"Yeah, but oddly enough, we have<br/>right on our side this time," replied<br/>Carrot. He nodded at Saffron with his<br/>smirk never leaving his face. "It's<br/>about time you woke up. Did you have a<br/>nice nap?"<p>"I like you," said Saffron as the<br/>bird was sucked into his body in a few<br/>seconds time. He opened his own wings<br/>and stared at the figure floating in<br/>front of him. "It's a shame I have to<br/>kill you."<p>"Well, I wish I could say the same,<br/>but I'm going to enjoy tearing you<br/>apart."<p>"Even if you could, it wouldn't<br/>really hurt me," said Saffron with a<br/>small chuckle.<p>"Don't be so sure of that bird boy,<br/>it might not kill you, but it'll<br/>definitely hurt," replied Carrot.<p>"So you realize that I cannot be<br/>destroyed?" said Saffron. "Why bother<br/>fighting? It's futile."<p>"Killed? No, you can't be killed,<br/>but I can turn you back into that brat<br/>again if I work at it enough."<p>"Maybe so, but you do know what<br/>happened to the last one who did that?<br/>I'm still here, and he has been dead for<br/>some time."<p>"You're confident," replied Carrot<br/>with a small chuckle.<p>"You're weak," responded Saffron.<p>"Humph, I'm a lot of bad things,<br/>weak isn't one of them," snorted Carrot<br/>as he finally started to show annoyance.<br/>"Still, I'm sure we'll have loads of fun<br/>blowing up the area around here before<br/>you figure that out."<p>"Sounds like fun, shall we start?"<br/>said Saffron as he pointed his finger at<br/>his opposition.<p>Carrot took up a fighting stance and<br/>smirked. "Sure thing."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"They're going to fight?" muttered<br/>Usagi dumbly. "No! Daddy!"<p>"That idiot! He'll be incinerated!"<br/>snarled Herb.<p>"What's he holding?" grumbled Kiima.<p>"The Gekkaja," replied Dan casually.<br/>"Carrot probably knows what it is."<p>"What?" gasped the woman as she<br/>stared at him.<p>"My father's staff?" said Herb in<br/>shock.<p>"What the heck is that thing?"<br/>grumbled Ukyo.<p>"I'm not sure," admitted Yohiko.<p>"It's the counter to the Kinjakan, a<br/>cold weapon," replied Dan. "He can use<br/>it to protect himself from Saffron's<br/>power."<p>"Only to a limited extent," said<br/>Kiima. "It's power alone isn't enough.<br/>He could have used it to survive that<br/>inferno in the mountain though. It<br/>explains how he's still around."<p>Dan merely chuckled and looked back<br/>up at the sky again. "This should be<br/>very interesting at any rate."<p>++++++++++++++<p>The Musk Village...<p>Ranma Saotome stood looking out over<br/>his village with a scowl on his face.<br/>His eyes moved over to the horizon and a<br/>shiver ran down his spine. "Something is<br/>wrong."<p>A black cloud formed in the sky in<br/>the distance. His frown deepened and he<br/>turned to look at the village again.<br/>"Herb...I..." Finally, he hung his head<br/>and simply stood there. "Come back all<br/>right, ya stupid jerk."<p>+++++++++++<p>Carrot laughed, it was cold and<br/>cruel sounding. He floated in the air<br/>staring at his opponent fearlessly.<br/>"You're nothing but a bird that's caught<br/>himself on fire. I'll show you what real<br/>power is!"<p>Saffron snorted in disgust. "I<br/>didn't come here to trade insults with<br/>you."<p>"Oh?" The man blinked and looked his<br/>opponent up and down. Saffron was still<br/>clothed surprisingly enough. He was<br/>wearing the same clothes he'd<br/>transformed in, but they hung off of his<br/>body in rags. His frame was lithe, with<br/>very little muscle definition. His hair<br/>had grown longer, and his features<br/>sharpened, otherwise he looked much as<br/>he did as a child. With the exception of<br/>the huge wings that protruded from his<br/>back, and the claw like hands that now<br/>replaced his more human like appendages.<br/>"Well, what did you come here for then?"<br/>Carrot actually looked somewhat<br/>surprised.<p>"I came here to kill you," replied<br/>Saffron.<p>"Why?" said Carrot as he blinked<br/>again.<p>"What?" said Saffron as he stared at<br/>the man.<p>"I mean, I haven't really done<br/>anything to you," replied Carrot with a<br/>small shrug.<p>"You!" snarled Saffron angrily. "You<br/>humiliated me at the hot springs."<p>"Yeah, but we had fun beating up all<br/>those people," countered Carrot.<p>"Those were my people!" snapped the<br/>godling irritably.<p>"So?" retorted Carrot.<p>"I see your point," muttered Saffron<br/>as he seemed to think about it.<p>"Okay, but we should still fight,"<br/>replied Carrot cheerfully.<p>"What? You just said..."<p>"I said you didn't have any reason<br/>to attack me, I have plenty to attack<br/>you!" replied Carrot.<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"You're going to take over the<br/>world!"<p>"So?" snapped Saffron.<p>"Oh, right...good point..." agreed<br/>Carrot as he mulled over that for a<br/>moment. "What the hell!" he finally said<br/>as he shot forward and punched at the<br/>godling. "It'll be fun beating each<br/>other to death!"<p>"Ha! You can't lay a finger on me!"<br/>snarled Saffron as his aura blasted to<br/>life around him again. This time forming<br/>a huge ball of fire to protect himself<br/>from the assault.<p>Carrot held the staff in his hands<br/>forward. The half-moon shaped edge on<br/>the top pointed forward. It was much<br/>simpler in design than the Kinjakan.<p>Saffron's eyes went wide as he tried<br/>to twist out of the way as it penetrated<br/>his aura. Carrot shifted at the last<br/>moment and hooked his fist across the<br/>god's jaw. Saffron was thrown back<br/>several feet by the force of the blow<br/>and righted himself.<p>"Damn you! That hurt!" snarled the<br/>birdman angrily.<p>"That was just a tap!" countered<br/>Carrot as he smirked at Saffron and<br/>backed away from him. "You can't take a<br/>hit it seems, all that soft living is<br/>working against you!"<p>"I'll show you who can't take a<br/>hit!" screamed Saffron in rage. A huge<br/>ball of fire formed in his hands and he<br/>blasted it forward.<p>Carrot twisted in mid air, but it<br/>wasn't enough. The fireball exploded<br/>across his back and he screamed in pain<br/>as it burned around him. He faltered in<br/>flight, falling for a few hundred feet<br/>before he caught himself. "Damn. That<br/>sucked," he muttered to himself<br/>painfully as he slowly turned to face<br/>the god again. "I think I'm in more<br/>trouble than I thought. I won't be able<br/>to take many of those." He twirled the<br/>Gekkaja around in his palm and pointed<br/>it at Saffron in an offensive posture.<br/>"We're gonna have to take him down<br/>fast."<p>"Who are you talking to?" snorted<br/>Saffron.<p>Carrot ignored him and cupped his<br/>palms together at his side. "No one,<br/>Kamehameha!"<p>"Pathetic!" snarled Saffron as his<br/>shield of flames held strong against the<br/>attack. "You're too weak to beat me!"<p>"Who said that was supposed to<br/>hurt?" said Carrot from behind him.<p>Saffron gasped as he tried to turn.<br/>It was too late though, and a sharp pain<br/>exploded across his back. He felt<br/>himself tumbling to the ground below.<br/>"Damn!"<p>Carrot chuckled, his opponent had<br/>been so preoccupied by his chi blast,<br/>that he hadn't even taken it into<br/>account that he had gone elsewhere. He<br/>had used the blade on the Gekkaja to<br/>slice off his wings. "He's powerful, but<br/>an idiot. No tactics at all, We can use<br/>that."<p>Saffron growled as he landed on the<br/>ground and created a crater. The blow<br/>shattered his entire body, and he stared<br/>up at Ranma. He couldn't even scream at<br/>the moment despite the fact that his<br/>body was completely broken. He felt the<br/>bones reforming, and his wings coming<br/>back. "I'll burn him to dust! Along with<br/>anything else that gets in the way!"<p>"Ranma, remember what I told you<br/>about?" said Carrot as he glared down at<br/>the fallen god.<p>"Really tight, a Hiryuu Shoten Ha<br/>that will penetrate him?" asked the<br/>other voice.<p>"Right, we've got to be fast. He'll<br/>regenerate if we take too much time." He<br/>readied himself and drew his arm back.<p>Saffron was slowly rising to his<br/>feet when he felt something in the air<br/>above him. "What?" His eyes stared up<br/>and his jaw fell open. The super<br/>compressed tornado ripped through his<br/>chest and he screamed in agony. The fire<br/>around him burned brighter and he fell<br/>to his knees. "Damn!"<p>"Got him!" screamed Carrot in<br/>triumph. The dust cleared on the ground<br/>below and Saffron was simply kneeling on<br/>the ground clutching what was left of<br/>his chest. His face was contorted in<br/>pain as he tried to breathe without his<br/>lungs. "He's still there?"<p>Saffron glared up at him, the hole<br/>in his body closing visibly. He tried to<br/>speak, but no words escaped his lips.<br/>Finally, he roared in anger and pain,<br/>ripping his wings off of his back.<br/>Rearing his arms back he threw them at<br/>Carrot.<p>The martial artist dropped like a<br/>rock, his wings folding in front of him.<br/>"Damn!" The impact of the razor sharp<br/>weapons slammed into them and they<br/>slammed into the ground a moment later.<br/>Slowly, the black cocoon opened up,<br/>revealing a heavily breathing Carrot.<p>Saffron was able to speak again and<br/>he narrowed his eyes at his opponent.<br/>"You're as strong as you said you'd be.<br/>I'm impressed." His eyes were serious,<br/>and he scowled hatefully at the man.<p>"You're stronger than I'd thought<br/>too. I was certain that attack would<br/>destroy you."<p>"If I had less control, it might<br/>have," replied Saffron coolly.<p>"What the hell are we gonna do now?"<br/>said Carrot to himself as he stared at<br/>the ground for a moment. Saffron was<br/>still too badly injured to attack, but<br/>the shield of flames was enough to keep<br/>them back. The Gekkaja was starting to<br/>grow warm in his grip, telling him that<br/>it might not be a good idea to charge<br/>into it and rely on the staff to protect<br/>them. "We're in a shit load of trouble<br/>Ranma."<p>"I've got an idea."<p>Carrot blinked and simply nodded.<br/>"It's your show."<p>Saffron narrowed his eyes as his<br/>opponent's face changed suddenly. "You<br/>can't reach me, and I'm too hurt to<br/>attack just yet. It seems we have a<br/>stalemate at the moment. I will recover<br/>quickly though." His chest was almost<br/>healed as he said this. "Then, your life<br/>will end."<p>"Jusendo is a spring Saffron," said<br/>Carrot calmly as he lifted the staff in<br/>his hand over his head. "I'm betting I<br/>know your real weakness. Not the cold,<br/>but an environment where fire cannot<br/>survive!"<p>"What are you doing?" growled<br/>Saffron hatefully. The man was walking<br/>with his eyes just behind where he was<br/>standing.<p>"Bakusai Tenketsu!" screamed Carrot<br/>as he slammed the staff into the ground.<br/>He jumped back away from the explosion<br/>and smirked. A huge column of water<br/>exploded from the ground. "Found it on<br/>my first try!" cried Ranma as he<br/>smirked. He put out his hands and they<br/>started to glow. A shield of power<br/>formed over the water and Saffron's eyes<br/>went wide.<p>The water was redirected and blasted<br/>into the flaming barrier. It hissed<br/>angrily and Saffron tried to move, he<br/>couldn't move around very fast, and<br/>Ranma adjusted to keep it on him,<br/>stepping slightly around the hole.<p>Finally, the water broke through.<br/>Saffron screamed as his body was<br/>assaulted by the water. It was boiling<br/>hot, but it was enough. He put up his<br/>arms in defense and snarled angrily as<br/>best he could through the torrent.<p>He never saw Ranma dive into the<br/>water, holding the Gekkaja tightly in<br/>his grip. All he saw was the fist appear<br/>out of the water as the force of the<br/>geyser shot a blurry figure into him. It<br/>passed through the hole in his chest, or<br/>rather the small-unhealed portion.<p>Saffron's back exploded in a shower<br/>of gore, the winds of the Hiryuu Shoten<br/>Ha tearing through his back as if it<br/>wasn't there. The last thing the god<br/>remembered seeing was the smirk on the<br/>boy's face as he was shot back by the<br/>force of his own attack, overpowering<br/>the force of the geyser. Just before<br/>Carrot flew into the source of the<br/>torrent of water, the shield redirecting<br/>it dissipated, allowing it to shoot<br/>straight up again. "Hiryuu Shoten Ha<br/>revised! Expanding horizontal wave!"<p>The god screamed as the tight winds<br/>slowly moved outward, tearing his body<br/>to shreds as it did so, literally eating<br/>it's way inside out. Pieces of him flew<br/>in every direction, finally tossing his<br/>limbs and head away as they no longer<br/>had anything to hold them together.<p>Carrot and Ranma jumped forward into<br/>the geyser once again. They clung to the<br/>Gekkaja and used its power, creating a<br/>tower of ice that loomed in the valley.<p>From within the winds of the attack<br/>a light formed, and finally, it<br/>exploded. A huge sphere of flame shot in<br/>every direction, consuming hundreds of<br/>meters of land before it stopped and<br/>dissipated to nothing. When it was over,<br/>there was nothing but a small child<br/>lying in the middle of the battlefield.<br/>The child, and Carrot.<p>Slowly, the man rose to his feet and<br/>groaned. "Ranma, that really sucked.<br/>Don't ever do that again."<p>"Hey, we're alive aren't we?"<br/>responded the voice through his pain.<br/>"What the? What's that?"<p>"Saffron, we won," replied Carrot as<br/>he walked over and lifted the baby into<br/>his arms. It was crying softly, but<br/>stopped once it had contact with<br/>someone. He tossed the Gekkaja aside<br/>carelessly and chuckled. "So, it's<br/>over."<p>"What have you done?" cried a<br/>feminine voice from behind them.<p>Carrot turned and smirked as Kiima<br/>landed behind him. "I beat him, you can<br/>have him back now."<p>She fell to her knees and stared at<br/>Carrot in horror. "You...touched him!<br/>Fool!"<p>This caused Ranma to blink. "Huh?"<p>"He's bonded to you now!" replied<br/>the woman as she glared at him<br/>hatefully.<p>Carrot looked down at the laughing<br/>child and blinked. "What?"<p>"Without you, Saffron will die,"<br/>said Kiima as she stared at him with a<br/>saddened look forming on her face.<p>"What?" growled Dan as he stared at<br/>her.<p>"We can't...kill him," said Kiima as<br/>she stared at him.<p>"You can't?" said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"The hell I can't!" cried Dan<br/>angrily.<p>"That's enough," said Xellos as he<br/>appeared in front of Carrot and smirked.<br/>"You're not going to have your big fight<br/>now I'm afraid."<p>"It's over?" asked Ryoga.<p>"Finally!" agreed Usagi as she<br/>jumped up and down. Ryoga turned away<br/>from the display and blushed.<p>"You pervert, that's your cousin,"<br/>said Ukyo as she bopped him on the back<br/>of his head.<p>"She isn't!" snapped Ryoga angrily.<br/>"..." He stopped and looked at Yohiko<br/>for a moment. "Well, she is, but we<br/>aren't really related..."<p>"Huh?" said the Usagi as she looked<br/>at him.<p>"It's nothing. We should go back,<br/>Akari is probably worried..." he<br/>muttered to himself as he turned away<br/>from her.<p>"Um. Okay," said the girl as she<br/>looked at her mother.<p>Yohiko smiled lovingly at her lover<br/>as she walked up to Carrot and promptly<br/>kicked him square in the balls.<p>The man keeled over, but managed to<br/>hold on to the child in his arms.<p>"You asshole!" snarled the woman<br/>angrily. "I'm pregnant!"<p>"Oro?" said Carrot as he stared at<br/>her dumbly.<p>"I'll kill you!" she screamed.<p>"No! He cannot die!" cried Kiima.<p>Dan grabbed her arm and shook his<br/>head. "Just let it be."<p>Xellos smirked at her and turned his<br/>head slowly. He turned his back to her<br/>and chuckled. "I'm sorry Yohiko, but I'm<br/>afraid it's out of my hands."<p>"What?" said the woman as she turned<br/>to stare at him.<p>"You won't see me again after this,"<br/>said the mage calmly as he looked at<br/>her. "Phibrizzo, it's time."<p>"Right," said the boy as he appeared<br/>at Yohiko's side. He lashed out at her<br/>and a purple ball of power slammed into<br/>her body. She screamed in pain and fell<br/>forward, clutching her belly in agony.<br/>Blood began to seep through her fingers<br/>and she simply lay face first on the<br/>ground, in too much shock to even<br/>scream.<p>Xellos had his hand open, with his<br/>palm facing up. A small blue ball of<br/>power could be seen in his hand and he<br/>frowned. "I'm sorry, you won't be able<br/>to have any children here. In time, you<br/>will understand why." He faded away and<br/>Phibrizzo did the same, holding a small<br/>red energy ball in his own hand.<p>No one moved, all of them in too<br/>much shock to do anything. They simply<br/>stared at the scene in shock. Finally,<br/>Dan rushed forward. "No! What the hell<br/>did they do to her?"<p>Carrot merely stared at her, his<br/>entire body was numb and his jaw hung<br/>open. "What the?" He wasn't sure what he<br/>was feeling at the moment. Finally, he<br/>clutched Saffron to his chest and fell<br/>to his knees.<p>"Mother!" cried Usagi, it barely<br/>registered with him as he stared at the<br/>woman on the ground. Slowly she looked<br/>up at him, hatred clear in her eyes as<br/>she glared at him.<p>"You...I know it was you! It had to<br/>be you," she said coldly. Within a<br/>minute's time, she was on her feet,<br/>tears flowing from her eyes. "Damn you."<p>Carrot couldn't think of anything to<br/>say. She was probably right, however<br/>indirectly she meant it. He simply<br/>nodded his head and stood up as well. He<br/>looked her up and down and frowned<br/>again. She wasn't hurt. Whatever they<br/>had done to her, it was already gone.<br/>The only sign she was ever injured was<br/>the tear in the front of her dress along<br/>the belly, and the bloodstains that<br/>matted the cloth and her hands.<p>Finally, he stood up and started<br/>walking.<p>"Wait!" called Herb as he rushed<br/>after him. "Saffron!"<p>"Sorry Herb, I can't let you hurt<br/>him. I'm certainly not going to let<br/>these bastards corrupt him again," he<br/>turned to look at the Phoenix people and<br/>scowled at them. "You'll have your god<br/>back one day."<p>"No!" screamed Kiima.<p>"What are you doing?" cried Usagi.<p>"Take care of your mother kid, she's<br/>going to need it," said Carrot as he<br/>vanished from sight.<p>"Damn," grumbled Dan as he leveled a<br/>stare at the place where the man had<br/>disappeared. He knew it would be<br/>pointless to follow him. Convincing<br/>Kiima of that might take a little time,<br/>but he had all the time in the world.<p>It was over.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Xellos kneeled before L-sama and<br/>held the small energy ball in his hand<br/>up towards his master.<p>"You can take off that guise now<br/>Jadeite, you don't need it," said the<br/>supreme being as he chuckled to himself.<br/>It was obvious that some of him didn't<br/>completely agree with what he had been<br/>sent to do though.<p>"What do you mean?" asked the man as<br/>his true form appeared again.<p>"You don't have to pretend to be a<br/>Mazoku anymore. Phibrizzo has<br/>Shabranigdo in hell, and now Seiphied<br/>will join the heavens. The first of<br/>their kind."<p>"The gods will not like having their<br/>jobs taken over," replied Jadeite calmly<br/>as he nodded and peered at the fetus in<br/>his palm for a moment. It was almost<br/>reptilian.<p>"I'm simply going to remove them of<br/>their obligations to this world. It will<br/>take some time, the children have to<br/>grow, and become what they need to be<br/>for that to happen. They will remain in<br/>their stations in the new world, and the<br/>one I am about to recreate."<p>Jadeite nodded at this and looked at<br/>Seiphied again. "I see."<p>"I do wish she'd quit complaining<br/>though," grumbled L-sama. "You rotten<br/>bitch! This is what you get for making<br/>us sleep with a man!" It was almost as<br/>if he didn't realize he'd said that out<br/>loud. "Who the hell cares if it was<br/>funny! You got what you deserved!<br/>Besides, it's not like you don't get to<br/>raise them. It's just that you had to<br/>wait a while first..."<p>"I shall deliver him," said Jadeite<br/>with a small sigh. He turned away. L-<br/>sama was in the process of beating<br/>himself up again as he closed the door<br/>behind him.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>L-sama sighed as he finally managed<br/>to calm himself down. It had taken the<br/>better part of three days to do it. Now<br/>he could concentrate on other things.<br/>The world he had created would move on<br/>as it had. The parts of them living<br/>there would probably enjoy the rest of<br/>their stay there. Well, most of them at<br/>any rate. Now however, it was time to<br/>put a stop to their procrastination. It<br/>was time to fix the screw ups that had<br/>started the mess they called eternal<br/>life. Not that it would effect them<br/>much, but they would feel better after<br/>getting it done.<p>Another copy of them was lying on<br/>the table in front of them, just off to<br/>the pool that showed scenes of the<br/>Universe to them.<p>"All right, let's get this right<br/>this time," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"I bet you had all that planned from<br/>the beginning!" snarled Xianfu<br/>irritably.<p>"Let's not get into that," muttered<br/>Carrot as he narrowed his eyes and<br/>sighed. "In any case, we're not all<br/>going back this time."<p>"Huh?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"We're going back to fix things<br/>dolt, we need to have us pretty much the<br/>same as we were before," grumbled<br/>Carrot. "The bitch stays here."<p>"But, won't all the knowledge we've<br/>picked up..." started Pissant.<p>"You stay out of this!" snapped Dan<br/>angrily. "I see your point Carrot. She<br/>should stay here this time."<p>"Dolts," grumbled Xianfu irritably.<br/>"I don't want to go! After what you<br/>pulled the last time, you couldn't drag<br/>me!"<p>"Okay, then it's settled!" said<br/>Carrot cheerfully.<p>"What about Pissant? Can he stay<br/>behind too?" asked Dan hopefully.<p>"Yeah!" agreed Ranma.<p>"I thought you guys weren't going to<br/>change anything," said Xianfu as she<br/>narrowed their eyes. "That was the whole<br/>point of me not coming."<p>"Um...he was annoying too though,"<br/>said Carrot.<p>"I wanna see Usagi!" said the<br/>irritating voice firmly.<p>"Look you weenie, we've got<br/>enough..."<p>"I'm going and that's final! You<br/>guy's can't stop me anymore!" snapped<br/>the voice irritably.<p>"Yeah, but we have to kill people,<br/>and blow stuff up!" said Dan in a<br/>somewhat patronizing tone.<p>"Who the hell do you think is gonna<br/>stop you from blowing up too much?"<br/>retorted the voice. "We're supposed to<br/>be saving the planet, not messing it up<br/>again!"<p>Dan sighed, Ranma's eye was<br/>twitching, consequently so was everyone<br/>else's, and Carrot threw their arms into<br/>the air. "All right, fine."<p>"Wheee!" cried Pissant in triumph.<p>"Can we just get this over with?"<br/>grumbled Ranma.<p>"I guess so," replied Carrot.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome was lying dead in an<br/>alley. A large hole was burned into his<br/>chest and he was now simply lying in the<br/>middle of a drying pool of his own<br/>blood.<p>Without warning, his eyes snapped<br/>open and he gingerly touched his<br/>forehead as he groaned in pain. "We did<br/>it?"<p>Slowly, he rose to his feet and<br/>staggered. His hand went to his chest<br/>and he fingered the hole in his shirt,<br/>only to find unbroken skin.<p>A smile formed, it was not a<br/>pleasant sight to anyone who might have<br/>witnessed the resurrection. It was a<br/>smile that promised pain. "We did it."<p>"Go on Carrot, say it," said Dan<br/>with an evil sounding chuckle.<p>A light burst to life around their<br/>body, and their hair changed into a<br/>golden sheen. Ranma hovered above the<br/>ground and stared at his fist as he<br/>closed it in front of his face. "At<br/>last, I am the Prince of all Saiyans<br/>once again!"<p>Laughter echoed through the streets<br/>in the night.<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Well, here we go! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!
