</div>Before we begin, I'd like to clear something up. Dan and Carrot<br/>never get spoken lines. All dialogue with them is internal, meaning,<br/>inside Ranma's head. The outside world only sees Ranma Saotome, so<br/>that's what their dialogue to the outside world will be labeled as.<p>Before anyone suggests that I use a different punctuation system, such<br/>as "" for speech, [] for thoughts, ** for Chinese, and () for Pig<br/>Latin. I'd just like to point out that this method is bad grammar. I<br/>won't do it.<p>It's pretty obvious who's saying what most of the time, so a<br/>system like that isn't needed; and shouldn't be. If you have a doubt,<br/>look at the context of what's being said, and it should be clear. If<br/>it isn't, it probably isn't that important, or an ambiguous statement<br/>anyway.<p>Insertion<p>Part 3<p>Hallway Horrors.<p>+++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo was in a good mood. Tatewaki Kuno stood before her,<br/>with a bandage wrapped around his neck.<p>"What? Fiancee!" said the boy in shock.<p>"Uh huh, my dad and his dad decided. Akane's going to marry<br/>Ranma," said the girl cheerfully.<p>"Ranma Saotome!" cried the boy in anguish.<p>"Kuno! Go stand in the hall!" said the teacher.<p>Within thirty seconds, Kuno was racing down the hallway with a<br/>pair of buckets in his grasp. "I forbid it!"<p>++++++++++<p>"Well, it seems that our new student, Ranma Saotome, has recently<br/>returned from a visit to China. So lets all give him a warm Nihao<br/>welcome," said the teacher lazily as he read the file. "You can take<br/>that seat over there." He pointed out a random seat and the ponytailed<br/>boy sat down.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotme, was not happy. Not because of anything that was<br/>happening to him now, but because he had forgotten to be late to<br/>class. "So, we missed Kuno, big deal," said Dan lazily.<p>"What are you talking about?" grumbled Ranma.<p>"Nothing important. I doubt if we'll miss him. He'll come crashing<br/>through that door any minute now," commented Carrot lazily.<p>To the class, he looked rather board, and Akane was giving him<br/>nasty looks from her seat nearby. He yawned and looked over at the<br/>door for a moment.<p>"Three...two...one..." said Carrot calmly.<p>++++++++++<p>"I shall not allow it!" roared Kuno as he burst through the<br/>doorway.<p>"What the?" said Akane in shock.<p>"Nabiki told him," said Ranma as he glanced back at her lazily.<p>Akane blinked and glanced at him for a moment, before Kuno started<br/>his rant.<p>"I shall not allow this falsehood of an engagement to continue!<br/>Never! I shall not allow your engagement to Akane Tendo, Ranma<br/>Saotome!" screamed the boy at the top of his lungs.<p>Akane went pale, every student looked at the trio of students<br/>blankly.<p>"I don't need your permission, Kuno. There's nothing you can do,<br/>it's a matter of family honor, and none of your business. Unless you<br/>really want to fuck up Akane Tendo's giri, I suggest you forget about<br/>it."<p>"Giri?" muttered the boy as he stepped back in shock. "You would<br/>use her honor against her? Foul dog! How dare you keep her from her<br/>true love! The noble and righteous Tatewaki Kuno awaits her embrace<br/>with open arms!"<p>"Why is this my fault? I don't have any say in the matter. If you<br/>want to do something about the engagement, go talk to Soun Tendo. It<br/>was his idea," commented Ranma lazily as he stood up from his seat.<p>"Surely you cower in fear of my might, and seek to hide behind<br/>others! Manipulator! I shall free her from this unwanted engagement!"<br/>roared Kuno as he jumped towards the boy.<p>Akane was busy with the student body, who had now sprung to life<br/>and were bombarding the pair with questions. Ranma ignored it in favor<br/>of Kuno, while Akane stammered nervously and tried to convince them<br/>that it wasn't her idea.<p>++++++++++<p>"Let's use the grenade!" said Dan.<p>"I don't think that's a good idea, as cool as that'd be," grumbled<br/>Carrot as the boy charged them.<p>"We have to get out of here!" snapped Ranma as he took the<br/>initiative and bolted from the room.<p>Kuno cut the boy's desk in half and Ranma managed to make it out<br/>the door.<p>The teacher was still standing there, with his mouth hung open.<p>"Now what?" said Dan lazily as Ranma ran.<p>"I say we kick his ass again," offered Carrot.<p>"There's no room in here!" retorted Ranma.<p>"Eh, you're just being a wuss," countered Carrot.<p>"Let's blow him up!" cried Dan.<p>"Man, you really want to use that thing don't you," said Carrot.<p>"Hell yes!" snorted Dan.<p>"I said no! Do you want to get arrested?" snapped Ranma.<p>++++++++++<p>Kuno was still just behind them, waving the bokuten around<br/>angrily. "Hold still knave! Receive your punishment!"<p>Ranma stopped cold and turned to face the boy. "But...wouldn't<br/>that be stupid?"<p>"It is fitting that you do so to not exert me. After all, it is<br/>inevitable that I will be victorious!" said Kuno as he stood proudly<br/>and puffed out his chest.<p>"Not really, I beat you earlier pretty easy," continued Ranma as<br/>he looked thoughtful for a moment.<p>"I do not admit defeat!" snapped Kuno as he glared at the boy.<p>"That doesn't change the fact that you were beaten," pointed out<br/>Ranma. "Whether you admit it or not is irrelevant."<p>"Silence dog!" snapped Kuno as he slashed the blade again. Ranma<br/>nimbly sidestepped and put his foot out, tripping the kendoist.<p>Kuno was laid out across the floor, face first. He lifted his head<br/>up and glared at Ranma for a moment. "That hurt you know."<p>A crowd of students was rushing up just behind them. "Oooo! And<br/>the winner gets to go out with Akane!" exclaimed a girl near the<br/>front.<p>The girl in question was leading the mob, she took a quick glare<br/>back at them, but continued forward to where Ranma was standing over<br/>the fallen Kuno.<p>"It's over already?" said one of the boys in shock.<p>"Well, you saw what he did earlier," pointed out another boy.<p>Kuno sat up and looked at the crowd. "I am not defeated. 'Tis<br/>merely base trickery by the evil of Ranma Saotome."<p>"Evil?" said Ranma in mock confusion.<p>++++++++++<p>"Heh, that's us," snorted Carrot.<p>"Shut up!" snorted Ranma at him.<p>+++++++++<p>Outside Kuno was attacking them again. "Accept your fate! Be still<br/>knave!"<p>"Nope, nuthin doin," said Ranma in retort. He was cheerfully<br/>bouncing off the walls. His face became serious again suddenly. "This<br/>is no place to fight Kuno! Follow me!"<p>"That I shall!" replied the kendoist.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Not the window!" snapped Carrot as he halted the body suddenly.<p>"What the?" said Ranma out loud as he felt himself stop. He<br/>quickly twisted and moved down a flight of stairs.<p>"What did you do that for?" snapped Ranma angrily at Carrot.<p>"There's a pool outside that window. We would have gotten wet,"<br/>replied the voice as he rushed out onto the schoolyard.<p>"Oh," muttered Ranma angrily.<p>"But that would lead too..." started Dan.<p>"I know, but I'm not in the mood. I say we kick his ass soundly.<br/>So bad that he can't deny that we beat him down!" said Carrot<br/>cheerfully as he moved into a combat stance.<p>"Works for me," agreed Ranma.<p>"Can we use the..."<p>"No!" was the simultaneous reply.<p>"Dang."<p>+++++++++<p>At that moment, Kuno rushed out the doors. "Have at thee!"<p>"Okay! You asked for it!" said Ranma as cheerfully as ever. He<br/>charged the kendoist head on.<p>Kuno slashed and missed as Ranma danced around his strikes,<br/>punching and kicking at the older boy viciously. Kuno staggered back<br/>and grunted after a dozen or so strikes hit him.<p>"Hey. Does that hurt?" said Ranma as he hopped up and down<br/>unharmed nearby.<p>"Yes!" snapped Kuno irritably as he rubbed his jaw.<p>"Okay, I just wanted to make sure you knew you were being<br/>defeated," said Ranma with a merry looking grin.<p>"I do not admit defeat!" snapped Kuno.<p>"I thought we went over this earlier," muttered Ranma in mock<br/>confusion as he avoided more strikes from the kendoist.<p>"You cannot defeat me!" said Kuno as his bokuten suddenly became a<br/>blur of motion in front of him.<p>"Sure I can!" said Ranma as he jumped up and back from the<br/>strikes. The blows shredded his clothes a little, but did no real<br/>damage. Behind him, a statue crumbled to dust.<p>Kuno finally faltered in his attack, and Ranma winked at him.<br/>Then, the ponytailed boy rushed forward, slamming his fist into his<br/>gut. "The mighty blue thunder has never felt defeat!" roared the<br/>kendoist as he pulled back and prepared to strike again.<p>"Really? Well," elbow, "this," punch, "is," kick, "what,"<br/>uppercut, "defeat," knee, "feels," bitch slap, "like."<p>Kuno fell to his knees, leaning against his bokuten. "I fight on!"<p>Ranma punched him dead in the face, sending him sprawling across<br/>the ground on his back. He was still awake, but could obviously not<br/>move. "So now you know," said the boy cheerfully as he looked down at<br/>his fallen opponent.<p>"I feel nothing!" announced Kuno.<p>"That's because your nerves are in shock," commented Ranma lazily<br/>as he walked back towards the school. The crowd that had followed them<br/>parted in his wake. "It'll hurt later."<p>++++++++++<p>Carrot was happy. "That was fun!"<p>Ranma was feeling pretty good too. "I guess, it was better than<br/>that schoolwork stuff."<p>Dan was disappointed. "Why couldn't we use my grenade?"<p>Akane was angry. "That stupid jerk! Why'd he have to go and tell<br/>the whole school?"<p>Yuka, Akane's friend, was jealous. "Man, Akane got such a cute<br/>boyfriend."<p>Sayuri, Akane's other friend, was happy for her. "I know! She's so<br/>lucky! I'm glad she finally found someone!"<p>Hiroshi and Daisuke, Ranma's soon to be friends, were thinking<br/>perverted thoughts in unison. "I wonder if he's ever seen her...Hell!<br/>They've probably... I'll bet they've even..."<p>Every other male in the room, was depressed. "Akane! We shall<br/>never forget you! Our first true love!"<p>Kuno was in pain, "Perhaps the young Saotome has fought me to a<br/>draw? Such an even match of skills..."<p>Nabiki was counting her money, and wishing she had more. Luckily,<br/>Kuno would see to that many times during the day.<p>The janitor was crying. "Stupid martial artist! This was supposed<br/>to be an easy job!"<p>The teacher had still not moved from his initial shock, and simply<br/>stood in the front of the room staring at the far wall.<p>The security guard sat at his desk, sleeping soundly. "Ah-cha-cha-<br/>cha..."<p>The vice-principal was crying, powerless to do anything about the<br/>mess.<p>Thus, all was right with the world.<p>But then, why did Sailor Pluto still have a headache?<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma walked home from school with a rather lazy stroll. Akane had<br/>gone on ahead of him, in favor of her friends. She vainly hoped to<br/>convince them that her fiancee was in name only. They of course<br/>insisted on asking embarrassing questions. Like, "How does he kiss?"<br/>and the like.<p>The day had been rather bland after the incident with Kuno. Carrot<br/>and Dan kept him occupied through most of the day. Basically<br/>conversing inside his head while the teacher droned on about some<br/>impact or something or other, that is, after he finally recovered.<br/>None of the three was paying attention anyway, so it didn't matter.<p>They passed by a rather attractive looking girl as they walked<br/>towards the Tendo home. A girl with long green hair, dressed in a<br/>business suit.<p>Ranma paused with a blank look on his face as she strolled by,<br/>rubbing her temples lightly.<p>"Hey! Look, it's Sailor Pluto," quipped the boy with a cheerful<br/>smile.<p>Setsuna froze in mid stride, slowly turning towards the boy who<br/>was grinning at her dumbly.<p>Ranma obliviously continued. "You're kinda cute. Can I buy you a<br/>cup of tea or something?"<p>"Who are you?" snapped Setsuna angrily. Her fists balled up and<br/>she stepped back away from him.<p>The boy blinked and looked around. Finding no one else standing<br/>nearby, he answered her. "Ranma Saotome."<p>"What do you know about Pluto?" she snarled angrily.<p>"Ninth planet in the solar system, really cold, really small, and<br/>really far away," said the boy obliviously.<p>"That's not what I meant," snapped the girl as she rubbed at her<br/>temple again, not even realizing what she was doing.<p>Ranma blinked, looking her up and down for a moment. "Huh? What<br/>the heck are you talking about?"<p>"You called me Sailor Pluto. Why?" said the woman as her frown<br/>deepened even more.<p>"Cause you kinda look like her. Sorry, I didn't know it was a soft<br/>spot," said the boy as he backed away from her with his hands put up.<br/>"I didn't mean anything by it."<p>"How would you know what Sailor Pluto looks like?" said Setsuna as<br/>she relaxed a little.<p>"Um, cause I've seen her before?" ventured Ranma nervously.<p>+++++++++<p>"You've seen Sailor Moon before right, Ranma?" said Carrot<br/>nervously.<p>"Who hasn't?" muttered Dan. "If he's a Japanese national, he's at<br/>least heard of it."<p>"Huh? Sailor what?" replied Ranma dumbly.<p>"Oh boy," said Carrot nervously.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Where would you have seen Sailor Pluto before?" said Setsuna in a<br/>very dangerous tone.<p>"Wait. You mean...you really are Sailor Pluto?" said Ranma as he<br/>backed away from her with a little sweat forming on his brow.<p>"You've got some explaining to do," said the woman sharply.<p>"Think fast genius! She's gonna kill us!" snapped Dan.<p>++++++++++<p>"Oh man," muttered Carrot as he desperately tried to think of a<br/>way out. "I've got it!"<p>"Got what? What's going on? Who is this chick? And why do I feel<br/>like Carrot just screwed up?" cried Ranma in frustration.<p>"Probably because he did," said Dan with a small frown.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma looked at the woman and gave her a nervous grin. "Look, I've<br/>been having these really weird dreams lately. I'm in some sort of<br/>kingdom, and I recognized you. I didn't think they meant anything!<br/>Honest!"<p>Pluto frowned even deeper than before. "That shouldn't be<br/>possible. Only the senshi, and a few other key members of the Moon<br/>Kingdom were reborn," she thought to herself. "I don't recognize you."<p>"Huh? What do you mean? We were engaged or something!" snapped<br/>Ranma.<p>+++++++++++<p>Carrot and Dan fell silent, both of them not wanting to say<br/>anything as Ranma blurted out something that surprised the both of<br/>them.<p>"We were?" said Carrot after a moment.<p>"Huh? I dunno," said Ranma in confusion. He was starting to wonder<br/>why he had said that himself.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Pluto continued to glare at him for a moment. "Tim?" she said out<br/>loud. "No wait, that's not right...what was the name...oh yes.<br/>Genaku." She did not sound like she liked the name very much.<p>++++++++++<p>"Not good. She doesn't look happy," commented Dan. "Can I use the<br/>grenade now?"<p>"That might be a good idea," said Carrot nervously.<p>"Shut up! She ain't done nuthin yet!" snapped Ranma as he watched<br/>her carefully.<p>++++++++<p>Setsuna glared at the boy for a moment, and then whirled around.<br/>"I don't know you."<p>All three boys involved quickly relaxed.<p>The girl walked away calmly, leaving them behind. Naturally, she<br/>had other things to do, and it wasn't like the engagement still held.<br/>It was till death do they part, after all. Genaku had most certainly<br/>died.<p>"Man, what crawled up her ass?" muttered Ranma as he watched her<br/>go.<p>"I dunno, but I think it would be a good idea too leave her alone<br/>if we see her again," commented Carrot.<p>"Don't be such a wuss," snorted Dan.<p>"Yeah!" agreed Ranma.<p>"You two shut up! I don't know about you morons, but I don't want<br/>to be on the receiving end of a Dead Scream!" snapped Carrot<br/>defensively.<p>"So, now what?" muttered Ranma as he started walking again.<p>"We gotta do something to Nabiki, just to make sure she doesn't<br/>try anymore stupid shit with us," said Carrot coolly.<p>"I can handle that," said Dan lazily.<p>"I didn't mean kill her!" snapped Carrot.<p>"Oh. Well, tell me if you change your mind," said Dan with a<br/>shrug.<p>"Will do," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma was sitting in front of the TV a half-hour later. He had a<br/>huge grin on his face as he did so, and merrily hummed along with the<br/>theme to the show.<p>"What are you doing?" asked Nabiki.<p>"Watchin TV," said Ranma happily.<p>"I can see that. What is that anyway?" said the girl as she sat<br/>down next to him and sipped at a can of soda lazily.<p>"Dragonball Z!" chimed Ranma.<p>"You're an anime fan?" said the girl with a raised eyebrow.<p>"Yup, this stuff is a luxury for me," said the boy as he kept his<br/>eyes glued to the screen.<p>"I guess it would be if he spent all that time on the road," said<br/>Kasumi as she walked into the room and sat down with a cup of tea in<br/>her hands.<p>"Boy! You don't have time to waste watching this rubbish!"<br/>exclaimed Genma as he walked into the room. He walked over and<br/>attempted to lift the boy up.<p>Ranma, Dan, and Carrot all reacted in the same way. The trio<br/>punched the man at the same time.<p>Genma Saotome flew into the air, and out into the yard. He slammed<br/>into the wall and slumped down. "It can wait...until the show is over<br/>I suppose."<p>Ranma was too busy looking at his hand in confusion. "What the<br/>heck was that?" the three voices thought in unison.<p>After a moment, they shrugged it off and sat back down.<p>"Wasn't that overdoing it a bit?" commented Nabiki as she sipped<br/>at her drink again.<p>"No one messes with a man and his Anime," replied Ranma as he<br/>nodded sagely.<p>++++++++++<p>Tatewaki Kuno sat in his room, deep in meditation. "I was almost<br/>defeated this day. Thankfully, my superior skill allowed me to escape<br/>such humiliation. Thus, I must think of a way to lay this sorcerer<br/>low."<p>And he puzzled, and puzzed, till his puzzler was sore. Then Kuno<br/>had an idea. Tatewaki Kuno, got a wonderful, awful, idea. "I know just<br/>what to do!" Kuno laughed in his throat. "I'll make a quick Santy<br/>Claus hat and a coat!" Kuno paused. Perhaps that would not be of much<br/>help after all. He continued to think.<p>+++++++++++<p>Deep in the mountains of Japan, inside a small village nestled in<br/>a tiny valley, a young boy rode through the forest on his mighty<br/>steed. Which consisted of him hopping around while banging two coconut<br/>halves together. Quite an odd sight indeed.<p>He paused, rearing back as he did so. "Whoa! Easy now!"<p>The boy frowned as he glanced around. "Oh bother, this isn't it<br/>either."<p>"Who the heck are you?" said a voice from nearby. There was a<br/>small group of locals looking at him oddly.<p>"Hello! Jolly good weather we're having isn't it?" said the boy as<br/>he pulled a jet-black European style umbrella from across his back and<br/>put it up over his head. "Jolly good indeed!"<p>One of the locals blinked and stared at him for a moment. "No,<br/>it's raining."<p>"Quite," said the boy with a cheery looking grin.<p>"You lost or somethin?" asked the man.<p>"What? Me, lost? Don't be...Actually...well, yes. I am," said the<br/>boy as he put his nose up slightly.<p>"Stupid tourists," muttered a few of the crowd as they wandered<br/>away.<p>The boy handed over a map, and pointed to a location. "I'm looking<br/>for a chap named Ranma Saotome, I believe he is in a place called<br/>Furinkan High."<p>"You're nuts, this is Tokyo! You're on the wrong island!"<p>"Oh! Oh my! Terribly sorry to bother you then," said the boy as he<br/>wandered away.<p>"Funny, he doesn't look like a gajin," commented one of the<br/>remaining villagers.<p>"Must be American," snorted the lead villager as he wandered back<br/>to whatever it was he was doing.<p>"Prepare yourself Ranma Saotome! I shall at last defeat you! No<br/>one does something so rude to Ryoga Hibiki and escapes his wrath!"<br/>said the boy as he rode his mighty steed deeper into the mountains.<p>++++++++++++++<p>I know what you're thinking. WTF? Heh, there's reasons for<br/>everything people.<p>Next time: Kuno's revenge, ponytailed loves, and Gentlemen's<br/>honor.<p>Heh.<p>
