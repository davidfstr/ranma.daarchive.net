</div>Insertion<p>Part 10<p>Fun at the beach.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma strolled down the street, dressed in a black Chinese shirt<br/>and a pair of black slacks. A pair of Rayban shades hid her eyes from<br/>view as she walked along. Her stroll was lazy and purposeful as she<br/>moved through the crowd of commuters.<p>"Ah summer," she said as she looked up at the sky and smirked,<br/>taking her shades off.<p>"What's with you?" muttered Akane as she walked up behind her and<br/>grumbled.<p>"I look good, I feel good, and this is a beautiful day," replied<br/>the redhead with a confident smirk.<p>"You don't look that good," snorted Akane irritably.<p>Ranma merely turned her grin towards her and put her sunglasses on<br/>again. "Yeah. I do."<p>Akane simply stared at the girl in shock as she continued to walk<br/>along the street. She crossed her arms and turned her nose into the<br/>air when she noticed the gaze of several young men train on the girl<br/>as she walked by. Ranma almost seemed to be dancing as she strolled<br/>down the street. The redhead paused in front of the Cat Cafe and<br/>smirked as she saw the sign hanging there.<p>"Moved to the beach for the summer. Management." There was a small<br/>map with the location of the new location on it.<p>"Looks like I'm taking a trip," said Ranma with a small chuckle.<br/>She spun around on her heels and walked away, Akane rushing up behind<br/>her with a confused frown on her face. The redhead paused and looked<br/>at her companion. She turned her head and looked up and down the<br/>street for a moment, noticing the hungry looking gazes of the young<br/>men, and a few of the older ones. "This won't do at all."<p>Akane blinked. "Huh?"<p>++++++++++++<p>Akane blushed as she stepped out of the store and looked down at<br/>herself. "What the hell is this?"<p>"You've got too loosen up a bit," said the redhead casually as she<br/>pat the girl on her back.<p>Akane was dressed in black, a tight fitting sleeveless black shirt<br/>with a turtleneck and slacks similar to her fiancee. Both of them were<br/>wearing polished black shoes with flat soles. "I can't wear this."<p>"It's all about attitude," said Ranma as he placed a pair of<br/>shades on her nose and smiled. "Follow my lead, you'll get it."<p>"But...Look you pervert," snapped the girl irritably.<p>"Hey, we went over this already. I've got someone already, and you<br/>ain't her. Relax, and enjoy yourself. You're too uptight right now.<br/>Calm down."<p>Ranma turned her back too her and glanced back at her. "Keep a<br/>straight face, relax when you walk, and remember. We're damn sexy."<p>Akane sighed and hung her head. "Look..." The redhead was already<br/>walking away.<p>"Hey! Wait up!" grumbled the girl as she followed.<p>It only took about ten feet, Akane found herself moving a little<br/>smoother as she strolled silently through the crowd behind Ranma, a<br/>little to the right of her.<p>After a moment, she realized what she was doing and paused,<br/>blushing badly. "What am I doing!"<p>"Huh?" muttered Ranma as she glanced back at her. "What's up?"<p>"It's nothing," said Akane as she steeled herself. "I could get to<br/>like this," she thought in confusion as she started walking again.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma walked into the Tendo home, and removed her shades in almost<br/>perfect unison with Akane as the strolled through the door.<p>Kasumi walked out to greet them and paused at the kitchen door.<br/>"Oh my!"<p>Nabiki turned the corner, she was sipping a drink and stared at<br/>the pair for a moment in silence.<p>"Hi," said Ranma as she strolled past her with Akane just behind<br/>her.<p>Nabiki promptly spit her drink across the hall and stared openly,<br/>her jaw hanging open. "Akane?"<p>The girl blushed, and hung her head as she realized that she was<br/>the one they were staring at. Her father was frozen, his newspaper<br/>hanging limply from his grasp. "Um. Hi. What do you think? Is it me?"<p>Nabiki seemed to snap out of her stupor in an instant. "Wow! I<br/>never knew you had it in you!" She pat her sister on the back and<br/>walked away cheerfully.<p>Akane blinked and looked down at herself again. "I guess so."<p>"Hey Pop," said Ranma as she looked over at her father. "What's<br/>goin on?"<p>"What are you doing boy?" said Genma as he stood up and glared at<br/>him.<p>"Goin to the beach," said the girl with a small shrug. "I gotta go<br/>get that pill from that old woman."<p>Soun shook his head, the surprise of his daughter's new look<br/>wearing off in an instant. "Pardon?"<p>"That ghoul moved her shop to the beach, I gotta go after her,"<br/>said the redhead with a small shrug.<p>"To the beach then!" announced Soun as he stood up with a fan in<br/>his hands.<p>"For Ranma's sake!" agreed Genma.<p>Nabiki threw her hand up into the air happily. "Yay!"<p>"How nice!" commented Kasumi.<p>++++++++++++<p>Several hours later, Akane stood next to her fiancee with a scowl<br/>on her face. "What the hell?"<p>The pair had just walked out of the changing booths, and Ranma was<br/>dressed in a very skimpily looking black bikini.<p>"What is it?" asked the redhead.<p>"What the hell are you wearing?" gasped Akane as she staggered<br/>back.<p>"Looks good, ne?" said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"But...you're..."<p>"I'm proud of how good I look, you should be too," snorted Ranma<br/>as he noticed her rather conservative one piece.<p>"What's that supposed to mean?" snapped Akane.<p>"Well, you've definitely got the body for clothes like this," said<br/>Ranma as she looked her up and down. "You're just too shy, or too<br/>nervous to wear them. I don't get why though."<p>"Cause I'm not easy! You perverted jerk!" snapped Akane.<p>"What? You think I am? I'm not easy Akane, I'm impossible," said<br/>Ranma as she put her shades on and grinned.<p>The girl blinked and stared at her dumbly. "Huh?"<p>"You've got to learn how to use this kind of thing to your<br/>advantage," replied the redhead as she scanned the beach for a moment.<br/>"Hmmm. Gotta find that ghoul." She grabbed one of the passing boys by<br/>his shoulder, it wasn't hard since an entire group of them had moved<br/>in for a closer look, they were trying too look casual about it, as if<br/>they weren't looking at all. "Hey, I'm looking for a place called the<br/>Cat Cafe," she said coldly.<p>The boy could feel her gaze on him through the shades, and she<br/>looked like she might hurt him. Not that he would have minded much if<br/>she did. He blushed badly and stammered. "Uh, it's about a half mile<br/>down the beach." He pointed over his shoulder with his thumb in the<br/>direction they had come from.<p>The girl merely nodded at him and let him go. She paused and<br/>looked towards Akane for a moment. "You coming?"<p>The girl blinked and turned to face her. "Huh? I guess."<p>About a quarter of a mile later, the pair walked through the sand.<p>Ranma looked rather cool and collected, while Akane glanced around<br/>nervously.<p>"I don't see anything yet," said Akane.<p>"We've got a little more walking to do first," replied Ranma as<br/>she continued to move forward.<p>A rather bulky looking man walked up between them and put his arms<br/>on their shoulders. "Hey, you two ladies look lost." He was obviously<br/>a body builder of some kind, and his smile was a devious looking grin.<p>"I know where I'm going, let's go Akane," replied the redhead as<br/>she shoved his hand away from her in disgust.<p>The black haired girl nodded and followed after her.<p>"Hey, come on! Maybe I can help you?" insisted the man as he<br/>jogged up to the pair. "I'm sure I could help you find a good time."<br/>He flexed his arm.<p>"Go away, we aren't interested," replied Ranma coldly. She had to<br/>put a restraining hand on Akane's shoulder. "Calm down, subtlety," she<br/>whispered to her.<p>Akane gave the man an evil looking glare, but complied.<p>"At least let me buy you a drink or something, come on," insisted<br/>the man. He was giving a thumbs up to a group of men who were watching<br/>the scene.<p>"If you don't leave now, I'm going to hurt you," said Ranma<br/>without turning to face him.<p>"And how is a pretty little thing like you going to do that?" said<br/>the man with a confident chuckle.<p>Akane got a rather satisfied look on her face as she slowly turned<br/>to look at him.<p>Ranma nodded too her and they both slammed their knees into his<br/>crotch at the same time.<p>The man said nothing, and fell too his knees in pain. Ranma merely<br/>smirked as she pushed her hand against his forehead and sent him down<br/>all the way.<p>"See, that was much more satisfying than just beating him, wasn't<br/>it?"<p>Akane looked up at her, not saying a word in reply. She smiled a<br/>little though.<p>"Here," said Ranma as she handed her the sunglasses she had bought<br/>for her earlier. "I figured you might want these."<p>Akane took them, and put them over her eyes. The pair strolled<br/>away from the scene, leaving a large group of cheering girls behind<br/>them.<p>+++++++++++<p>Cologne hopped back to the small stand where their business was<br/>based for the duration of the summer. She had an empty delivery box on<br/>her cane, and smiled cheerfully.<p>She paused when she found Mousse sprawled out across the ground.<br/>Ranma was leaning against the wall calmly, her foot planted on his<br/>back firmly.<p>"Son in law, I wasn't expecting to find you here," said the old<br/>woman calmly.<p>Ranma smirked and removed her sunglasses. "You didn't tell me you<br/>were moving, Boss."<p>"I thought you might enjoy a small break," said Cologne<br/>cheerfully. "What brings you here?"<p>"I figured you might need a little help, carrying around that pill<br/>all the time must be a terrible strain on your neck," said the redhead<br/>calmly.<p>"How kind of you," said Cologne cheerfully. "Come with me then."<p>"Hey Akane, looks like this might be interesting," said Ranma<br/>coolly.<p>The black-haired girl stood up from where she had been sitting on<br/>the beach nearby, watching the pair converse.<p>"And who might this be?" said Cologne as she looked the girl up<br/>and down.<p>"Just a friend of mine, nothing to worry about," said Ranma in<br/>reply.<p>Cologne nodded. "I see."<p>++++++++++++<p>"It's a race! It's a war!" cried the announcer excitedly as he<br/>attempted to draw a crowd.<p>"Martial arts melon splitting?" said Akane as she stared at the<br/>sign hanging over the event.<p>"Looks easy," snorted Ranma calmly. She was leaning against one of<br/>the signposts and looked rather bored.<p>"The contestants run while trying to split each other's<br/>watermelons. The first to reach the finish line with his melon intact<br/>wins!" explained the announcer.<p>The crowd around him began to disperse.<p>"And the prize for the winner is... Miss Shampoo!"<p>The Amazon girl stood on a podium with the pill hanging from her<br/>grasp. Every male in the crowd suddenly had his full attention on the<br/>prize.<p>"An interesting little game," commented Ranma.<p>"Indeed, if you want to win, you have to play," said Cologne.<p>Akane turned to see her family had been attracted by the<br/>commotion.<p>Ranma was currently still leaning against the pole, her gaze<br/>hidden by her sunglasses. Shampoo was staring her down angrily.<p>"Shampoo make sure you no win," said the Chinese girl.<p>The redhead merely snorted and stood upright. "Sounds like fun."<p>++++++++++<p>On your marks! Get set! Go!" cried the announcer as he started the<br/>race.<p>Ranma immediately dispatched her competition, slicing through<br/>everyone else's melons in an few seconds. She snorted and casually<br/>tossed aside the boken she had been given. "Easy."<p>Cologne dove from the sky, slamming her cane into the ground and<br/>forcing Ranma to move aside.<p>"So, you decided too play too then?" said the redhead as she<br/>cracked her knuckles.<p>"Don't get me wrong, I was just remembering the times I had<br/>playing on the beach as a child," said Cologne cheerfully.<p>Their battle was interrupted as Soun and Genma charged in. Genma<br/>was currently a panda, and they both converged on Ranma, trying to<br/>shatter her melon.<p>The redhead dodged and spun around to face them. "Humph. Stay out<br/>of this."<p>"What do you think you're doing?" snapped Soun.<p>"We came for that pill, and I'm going to get it," said Ranma<br/>calmly.<p>"How dare you try and win that girl!" said the panda's sign.<p>"I can't marry her if I'm stuck a girl, can I?" said Ranma with a<br/>confident smirk.<p>Cologne watched carefully as the trio faced off.<p>"Shampoo, no let girl win race! Kill!" snapped the Amazon as she<br/>jumped over the pair's heads and landed in front of Ranma. She sliced<br/>at the redhead with her own boken and missed by a hair's length as the<br/>girl sidestepped.<p>Ranma chuckled and put her foot through the girl's melon as she<br/>passed. "Looks like you're out."<p>"The prize has entered the fight! And has already been<br/>disqualified!" exclaimed the announcer.<p>Shampoo glared up at him angrily, her face covered in sand from<br/>her landing. He gulped nervously and turned his attention back towards<br/>the race. "The old woman, the young girl, the older man, and the panda<br/>are all that remain!"<p>"Make your choice!" said Soun as he and Genma shoved Shampoo and<br/>Akane in front of the redhead.<p>Ranma looked at the both of them, and merely stepped back.<p>Genma and Soun suddenly realized something was wrong, as the two<br/>girls in front of them began to glow.<p>"Saotome?"<p>"Growf?"<p>Ranma shrugged her shoulders and casually walked by the group as<br/>the two idiots were pounded by the two angry girls. She had her melon<br/>hefted onto her shoulder and calmly moved towards the finish line.<p>Cologne dove from above yet again and landed in front of him. "I'm<br/>afraid I can't let you win that easily. I won't let you pass until you<br/>promise to choose Shampoo."<p>Ranma merely smirked at her and nodded her head.<p>+++++++++++<p>"We're going to try that new technique out," said Carrot as they<br/>stared at the old woman.<p>"What?" said Ranma dumbly. "Isn't that a bit much?"<p>"No, not with this old hag," said Dan calmly. "You want me to<br/>wait?"<p>"For now, we may need that extra kick," commented Carrot. "You<br/>lead Ranma, this is your department."<p>"Right," said the boy in reply. "This is hard to do though. How<br/>are we going to manage?"<p>"Time the moves, we'll use our own heartbeat as a beat counter.<br/>It'll be a lot easier if we do it that way, it's just like we<br/>practiced it," said Carrot.<p>++++++++++<p>Cologne and Ranma clashed as the redhead charged forward. The old<br/>woman easily blocking the girl's strikes with her cane.<p>"You're a hundred years too young to keep up with me!" cackled the<br/>old woman merrily.<p>"I ain't even started yet!" cried Ranma as he thrust his arm<br/>forward.<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes and jumped up, leaving an opening to her<br/>melon. She launched her cane forward intending to take his out at the<br/>same time.<p>She missed.<p>"What? How?" snapped the old crone as she stared at the girl in<br/>shock. The strike should have been much too fast for her to dodge.<p>Ranma was smiling just beyond her reach. "Surprised?"<p>"Very. Who could have known you were good enough to split my<br/>melon?"<p>Ranma narrowed her eyes and held her melon behind her back. "Looks<br/>like I win then."<p>"Hardly, you've still got to get by me," snapped the old woman<br/>with a small unhappy looking glare.<p>"Easy enough," said Ranma with a small smirk on her face.<p>"If you win, I shall give you the Phoenix Pill, and if I win, you<br/>return too China with my Shampoo. How does that sound to you?"<p>The redhead smirked, she had been expecting this. "You got a<br/>deal."<p>Cologne charged forward, intent on putting a quick end to the<br/>fight now.<p>Ranma merely smirked, and a soft glow formed around her body.<br/>"Kaio ken!"<p>Cologne gasped as the redhead blasted forward. "What is this?" She<br/>found herself slammed into the ground as the redhead kicked her in the<br/>back after vanishing from sight and reappearing in front of her. She<br/>staggered back to her feet and turned to see the girl standing just in<br/>front of the finish line, the glow still throbbing around her body.<br/>"What? How?"<p>"Come on ghoul, I'll give you another shot," said the redhead with<br/>a confident smirk.<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes and dashed forward, surrounding Ranma as<br/>she spun around her with the Splitting Cat Hairs technique. The<br/>redhead merely stood in the middle calmly, while Cologne threw sand up<br/>at her from every direction.<p>Instead of attacking one of the images as Cologne had expected,<br/>Ranma jumped straight up into the air. "She's more foolish than I<br/>thought, that strike must have been a fluke." She stopped and waited<br/>for the girl to come down.<p>Ranma smiled as she saw the old woman stop, and the glow formed<br/>around her body again. "Kaio ken!" she vanished in mid-air and<br/>appeared behind Cologne, kicking her like a football into the air.<br/>Instead of stopping, she vanished again and appeared behind the ghoul<br/>as she landed, connecting with a punch to the old woman's gut.<p>"Impossible! No one can be this fast!" muttered Cologne as she was<br/>thrown into the air again, and came down against the girl's knee. The<br/>attack stopped, and she staggered to her feet. She glared at the<br/>finish line again, and saw the girl standing on the other side. "How?<br/>What technique is this? I've never seen anything like it!"<p>"Heh, that's a secret," replied Ranma as she winked at the old<br/>woman. "You owe me a pill."<p>"Very well," agreed the old woman reluctantly. She nodded towards<br/>Shampoo.<p>"Great Grandmother?" gasped the girl in shock.<p>"Give it too her Shampoo, I gave her my word of honor," snapped<br/>the old woman angrily.<p>The girl glared at Ranma hatefully and tossed the pill to her. She<br/>caught it and smirked as she opened the box and popped it into her<br/>mouth. "One more thing ghoul, that attack..."<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes and stared at her. "Yes?"<p>"That was only at half strength," said Ranma as she turned away<br/>from the old woman and walked over to her dumbstruck family.<p>"What?" gasped Cologne. "That's not possible!" She was not<br/>referring to the girl's comment, but rather the strange energy she had<br/>felt in the air during the battle. She was going over it in her mind<br/>over and over. If it wasn't some sort of illusion, the redhead's chi<br/>was doubling in spurts, each time she attacked with the Kaio ken.<br/>"Doubling your own fighting power in an instant? That isn't possible!"<br/>She turned towards her Great Granddaughter and motioned for her to<br/>follow. "We're leaving."<p>++++++++++++++<p>"That was cool!" exclaimed Akane as she stared at the redhead in<br/>awe.<p>"Most impressive," agreed Nabiki with a slight nod.<p>"Oh my! I hope that old woman wasn't hurt too badly," muttered<br/>Kasumi.<p>"Don't worry, she's fine," said Ranma as she waved the comment off<br/>and looked at her father and Soun.<p>"Boy! How dare you develop a secret technique without telling me!"<br/>said the panda's sign.<p>"If I told you, it wouldn't be a secret technique would it?"<br/>replied the girl with a rough snort.<p>"He's got a point, Saotome," commented Soun.<p>"How could you?" said the panda's sign as he looked towards his<br/>old friend.<p>"Can you show me how to do that?" asked Akane.<p>"No, sorry. You have to have something special inside you for it<br/>to work. I've never met anyone else with it besides me," said Ranma<br/>with a slight smirk.<p>"You don't think I'm good enough? Is that it?" snapped the girl<br/>irritably.<p>"You couldn't learn it if you were as good as I am," replied the<br/>redhead with a small shrug. "It's got to do with my curse."<p>Genma turned and stared at the boy for a moment, as if he suddenly<br/>realized something. "So, that's it? Is it?" said the sign as he<br/>narrowed his eyes at the girl.<p>"You've got it, Pop," replied the girl calmly.<p>Akane looked disappointed, but seemed to accept that answer.<p>"Come on, let's go home. I'm sick of being a girl," said Ranma as<br/>she started towards the changing room and flipped her shades on again.<p>The silence on the beach was suddenly shattered, as screams began<br/>to sound from a short distance away.<p>"Huh?" muttered Ranma as she turned to face the disturbance.<p>"What's going on?" asked Akane out loud.<p>A gigantic beach ball with arms and legs was tearing down the<br/>beach, smashing things.<p>"What the hell is that?" said Ranma dumbly. He paused when he saw<br/>a familiar figure running down the beach away from the thing. Turning<br/>towards his family he frowned. "Go home. I've got to go talk with<br/>someone."<p>"What?" gasped Akane in shock. "You aren't going to try and fight<br/>that thing are you? I'll help!"<p>"Do I look that stupid?" said the boy angrily. "The Sailor Senshi<br/>just got there." He pointed down the beach. Sure enough, the five<br/>girls were fighting with the monster already.<p>"I just saw a guy I know running away, go on without me. I wanna<br/>catch up with him. I'll be back later."<p>++++++++++++<p>Jadeite rushed through the crowd with an angry scowl on his face.<br/>"Damn! Those stupid senshi! How cold they have found out about my<br/>operation! Stealing energy with those evil seashells was a perfect<br/>plan!"<p>He gasped for breath and paused as he ran into a young boy who<br/>moved in front of him. "Out of my way!"<p>"Hey. Is that yours Jadeite?" said Ranma. He was once again in his<br/>male form, and dressed in his Chinese clothes again. He pointed at the<br/>gigantic youma and frowned.<p>"Huh? How do you know..." sputtered the dark general dumbly.<p>"Come on, you recognize your old friend Genaku don't you?" said<br/>Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Huh?" muttered the evil general dumbly.<p>"It's been a while. How've you been?"<p>"Genaku? What are you doing here? How? I mean, you're..." Jadeite<br/>seemed to realize something and snarled at the man. "So! You've been<br/>reborn to oppose us as well!"<p>"Oppose you? Why would I do that? Those crazy chicks are trying<br/>too kill me too," snapped Ranma irritably as he smacked the man in the<br/>back of his head.<p>"What?" said the general dumbly.<p>"I ain't figured it out yet, they don't like me for some reason<br/>though," said Ranma with a small shrug.<p>Jadeite blinked. "So, we share a common enemy?"<p>"Seems like it. Man, look at em! They can't even defeat a giant<br/>inflatable ball?"<p>"Diamos comes to mind," said Jadeite calmly.<p>"Serenity forgave me for that," said Ranma angrily.<p>"There was also that incident involving the polar caps of the<br/>moon, and five billion gallons of instant Ramen."<p>"Hey! It ended that famine didn't it?" said Ranma sourly.<p>"Or the time you sent that gigantic shipment of exploding<br/>marshmallows to the Senshi of Mars?"<p>"I helped clean it up," grumbled Ranma with his arms crossed over<br/>his chest.<p>"By showering the entire planet in chocolate bars and gramcrackers?"<br/>pointed out Jadeite.<p>"Hey, Serenity and her daughter were happy with it," said the boy<br/>with a small shrug.<p>"Or the time you poured a hundred billion pounds of powdered<br/>gelatin into the oceans of Venus?"<p>"Okay! I get the point!" snapped Ranma irritably.<p>"So, why don't you join us? We could use a man like you," said<br/>Jadeite calmly.<p>"Naw, think I'll stay neutral this time," said the boy with a<br/>small shrug.<p>"It's a shame. I would have enjoyed working with you again," said<br/>Jadeite with a small shrug. "What are you doing here anyway?"<p>"I dunno. I'm just getting my memories back recently. So, how have<br/>you been?"<p>"Fine I guess," muttered Jadeite.<p>"Hey, I'll buy you a drink," said Ranma as he motioned for the<br/>evil general to follow.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"All our attacks are bouncing off if it!" cried Venus as a few<br/>more of her crescent beams bounced off the plastic surface of the<br/>monster.<p>"What can we do?" said Mercury desperately.<p>"I'm not sure!" said Mars. "Don't just stand there you airhead! Do<br/>something! You're the stupid leader!"<p>"Wahhhh! I hate the beach!" cried Usagi as she dashed away from<br/>another blast of sand.<p>The creature was scooping up tons of it and blasting it at them<br/>with some sort of air nozzle. It would then puff itself up again and<br/>renew the assault.<p>"What is this thing made of asbestos?" snapped Mars as her flame<br/>attack bounced off of its back.<p>"It's flame retarded!" exclaimed Venus.<p>"Looks like you ladies could use some help," said Tsuki as she<br/>strolled up behind them with a confident looking smile on her face.<p>"So do something! You klutz!" snapped Mars.<p>"I am not a klutz!" snapped Tsuki as she glared at the girl and<br/>stomped her feet. Her foot hit a nearby beach chair, and knocked it<br/>over. The chair hit a nearby umbrella, and created a chain reaction,<br/>as the giant umbrella hit yet another one, and another one. Several of<br/>them were lined up along the beach, and they fell like dominos. The<br/>final one, ripped a gash in the side of the youma's skin, and it<br/>promptly screamed as it deflated into nothing.<p>"See," said Mars as she pointed at her.<p>"I'll have you know I meant to do that!" snapped Tsuki irritably<br/>as a long staff appeared in her hand. She vanished into a porthole<br/>that opened into the air behind her and left them alone.<p>"She sure is mysterious," commented Usagi.<p>"The only thing mysterious about her is the fact that she's a<br/>bigger klutz than you," said Rei.<p>"Gee, thanks Rei!" The girl paused as the statement sunk in a<br/>little more. "Hey! What's that supposed to mean!"<p>"Calm down!" said Makoto as she attempted to halt the argument.<p>"She's right, our real enemy has escaped," said Ami as she stared<br/>down the beach.<p>"He'll show up again," said Minako coldly.<p>"Unfortunately, you're right," said Luna as she walked up to them<br/>with Artemis at her side.<p>"Yeah! We'll get him next time!" exclaimed Usagi.<p>Minako sighed and shook her head. "This guy seems different from<br/>that other enemy."<p>"The man who killed that other senshi?" asked Ami nervously.<p>"Right," said the girl with a small frown. "Compared to him, this<br/>was nothing."<p>"You're scaring me!" exclaimed Usagi nervously.<p>"Some fearless leader," grumbled Rei as she turned away from the<br/>scene. "Come on, before the cops show up."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Jadeite and Ranma were rolling with laughter as they sat at the<br/>bar.<p>"I remember that now! I used about twenty five million gallons of<br/>yellow dye, and an interplanetary water cannon!" said Ranma as he<br/>pounded his fist on the counter of the small bar they had found<br/>themselves in.<p>Jadeite had tears flowing down his face as he chuckled.<br/>"It..it...it took her three years to clean it up. You're name was<br/>written across the equator of Pluto for three...three years!"<p>"Oh. I'm starting to realize why they want to kill me," said Ranma<br/>as he wiped his own eyes. He tossed some money on the counter and pat<br/>Jadeite on his back. "It was nice talking with you again, but I've got<br/>to get home. My family will kill me if I'm gone for too long."<p>"Beryl, she'll know about you," said Jadeite as he calmed down<br/>suddenly.<p>"So what? Tell her, that blowhard. I'm of no use to her, and she's<br/>got better things to do than hunt me down," said Ranma with a slight<br/>smirk.<p>"Nephrite might not be so kind," said Jadeite with a slight smirk.<br/>"I've got my own missions to complete, and I personally won't be<br/>bothered with hunting you down. But him..."<p>"He's still mad about that?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"Pissed," confirmed Jadeite calmly.<p>"It was just a little novocaine," said the boy with a small frown.<p>"It was his wedding night," pointed out Jadeite.<p>"Oh, right..." muttered the boy as he hung his head. "Well, look<br/>me up sometime. I'm sure I can handle that moron anyway."<p>"Suit yourself," replied Jadeite with a small shrug. "I'll see you<br/>around."<p>"Right," said Ranma with a small nod as he left the bar.<p>+++++++++<p>TBC...<p>
