</div>Insertion<p>Part 84<p>Attack on Jurai!<p>++++++++++++++<p>Trunks smirked as he held Ryoko by<br/>her neck in a headlock and pulled her<br/>behind him forcibly.<p>"You little runt!" cried the<br/>irritated woman as she was dragged along<br/>with Tenchi following behind her with a<br/>frown on his face.<p>"Ryoko!" muttered the boy<br/>uncomfortably.<p>"She'll be fine, we've got to show<br/>her how to use her power so she can kick<br/>her old man's ass when we get back<br/>though," said Trunks cheerfully as he<br/>continued on his way.<p>A Juraian guard followed behind<br/>Tenchi, none of them looked quite sure<br/>what to do. "Lord Tenchi, should we..."<p>Trunks smirked at them for a moment,<br/>pausing long enough for Ryoko to beat on<br/>his head a few times. "If you don't want<br/>them to get hurt, I wouldn't suggest<br/>that Tenchi," he replied calmly. "You've<br/>already seen what a Super Saiyan can do.<br/>Imagine what one with enough training to<br/>use all that power might be able to do<br/>to these men. The transformation Ryoko<br/>used against Kagato is nothing compared<br/>to what I can do myself either."<p>The boy went slightly pale and<br/>looked at the guards. "It's fine, she'll<br/>only be gone a day anyway."<p>Trunks smirked as the door opened in<br/>front of him. He smirked as the woman<br/>tried to phase out of his grasp, or<br/>teleport away desperately. Her power had<br/>been sealed away, as he had requested<br/>though. Washuu still hadn't undone the<br/>'declawing' as Trunks had affectionately<br/>dubbed it. "Well, come on then."<p>Hotaru was waiting just inside and<br/>turned as he pulled the woman in. Trunks<br/>blinked for a moment and cocked his<br/>head. "Hey, I just realized that there's<br/>only three of us."<p>"What of it?" muttered Hotaru<br/>irritably.<p>Trunks shrugged and reached back<br/>with his arm just outside the door.<br/>Panicked cries arose from those just<br/>outside as he tossed Tenchi Masaki on<br/>the ground and closed the door in their<br/>faces. "There, now we've all got a<br/>sparing partner."<p>Tenchi blinked and looked up at the<br/>boy dumbly from his back. "Wha?"<p>"Tenchi?" muttered Ryoko. She had<br/>calmed considerably when she noticed the<br/>boy sitting rather dumbly on the ground<br/>in front of her. She tried to crane her<br/>neck from under Trunks's elbow. It was<br/>quite uncomfortable for her, but she had<br/>managed.<p>"Yeah, we're gonna need someone<br/>pretty close to your power level for you<br/>to train with," replied Trunks<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Close to her power level?" said<br/>Tenchi dumbly. He stared at Trunks for a<br/>moment, apparently he had no illusions<br/>about how good his skills were in<br/>comparison to Ryoko's.<p>"You're the one who beat Kagato<br/>aren't you?" snorted Trunks.<p>Tenchi blushed slightly and turned<br/>his head away. "Well...I..."<p>"That Juraian power of yours isn't<br/>anything to scoff at. Although I admit<br/>you're a little under powered as far as<br/>Hotaru and I are concerned. At least we<br/>aren't stuck with that horrible demon<br/>this time."<p>"Demon!" cried Tenchi in panic.<p>"Relax, she's still outside," said<br/>Hotaru with a rough snort.<p>"Yeah, I don't think she'll bother<br/>us," agreed Trunks. "I sent her on a<br/>little errand for us, should take her<br/>all day on that end!" He smiled<br/>cheerfully and released Ryoko's head.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Meanwhile...<p>"Are you sure? They said they really<br/>wanted to have some for dinner<br/>tonight..." Mihoshi looked like she was<br/>about to cry, and the Jurian shopkeeper<br/>was panicking.<p>"I'm sure! I've never heard of it!<br/>Honest! Are you sure you're saying it<br/>right? We've got a lot of food with<br/>weird names here..."<p>"Yes I'm sure! Okonomiyaki! You've<br/>got to have some! It says you've got<br/>every food in the entire galaxy here,<br/>and I've been looking for hours!"<p>"I don't think there is such a<br/>thing," grumbled the man as he turned<br/>away on another fruitless search of the<br/>store. He knew there was no such food,<br/>or rather, he thought he knew. Trunks<br/>had asked Washuu before sending her off<br/>to find it. Earth was the only place in<br/>the galaxy that you could find the food.<p>"I promise, that I, Detective First<br/>Class Mihoshi, shall find you an<br/>Okonomiyaki for dinner tonight!" cried<br/>Mihoshi as her eyes burned with<br/>determination. She just had to find a<br/>store on Jurai, or one of the nearby<br/>moons that sold it...<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>"I am so out of here," grumbled the<br/>Ryoko as she headed for the door.<p>"You sure about that?" said Trunks<br/>playfully. "I mean, a day in here, last<br/>a whole year. A whole year alone with<br/>Tenchi doesn't sound that bad does it?"<p>Ryoko froze and slowly turned to<br/>look at the boy. "What?"<p>Tenchi struggled to his feet,<br/>realizing that he was having difficulty<br/>with it. "Hey, what the...?"<p>"Oh, that," said Trunks cheerfully<br/>as he waved his arm around. "This is the<br/>room of Time and Space! In here, a day<br/>lasts a whole year, temperatures<br/>fluctuate wildly, and I can control the<br/>gravity. The default setting is two<br/>times that of Earth. That's what you're<br/>feeling right now."<p>The boy blinked as he felt his arms<br/>hang down at his sides like they were<br/>weighted down. His whole body felt<br/>somewhat sluggish. He wasn't having much<br/>trouble moving around though, due to his<br/>grandfather's training.<p>Ryoko snorted in disgust and turned<br/>away. "Big deal," she muttered<br/>irritably.<p>"Oh, the fun's just started. We'll<br/>be increasing the gravity a little each<br/>day, starting tomorrow. For today, you<br/>can relax and get used to this place."<br/>He smiled at them all and flexed his<br/>arms. "Hotaru and I spent all day in<br/>here the other day. We're going off for<br/>a while; you two behave yourselves.<br/>We've got to spar a bit, and get used to<br/>the new gravity level. It's a bit low<br/>for us."<p>Hotaru narrowed her eyes and nodded.<br/>She floated off the ground and flew off<br/>into the vast nothing. Trunks followed<br/>behind her with a rather cheerful<br/>looking grin on her face.<p>Tenchi looked over at Ryoko<br/>nervously. "So...now what?"<p>The woman blinked and suddenly<br/>realized her situation. "Tenchi...we're<br/>all alone..." She skipped over to his<br/>side and smiled at him. "I'm sure we can<br/>think of something..."<p>"Ryoko!" cried the boy with a huge<br/>blush on his face. "Come on, stop it!<br/>This is serious! I can't spend an entire<br/>year in here with you!"<p>"Why not?" said Ryoko with a small<br/>pout on her face.<p>"Because! Grandpa is going to talk<br/>with the Emperor about those Senshi<br/>today!"<p>"I'm sure he can handle it," said<br/>Ryoko with a little seriousness in her<br/>tone.<p>"I told him I'd come along,"<br/>grumbled the boy with a small sigh.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Hotaru frowned as she punched at<br/>Trunks and dodged a kick meant for her<br/>head with practiced ease. The boy seemed<br/>to be only half paying attention to her,<br/>which irritated her slightly, while at<br/>the same time, humbled her a bit more<br/>about where she stood in comparison to<br/>him.<p>"Why did you bring that boy along?"<br/>she said as she flew back and stared at<br/>him for a moment.<p>"Huh?" said Trunks as he blinked at<br/>her. "Oh, you mean Tenchi?"<p>"Yes," said Hotaru as she powered<br/>down and floated opposite him.<p>"I think he needs the training for<br/>one, his grandfather is an excellent<br/>teacher, but we can show him a whole new<br/>level of his own power. He'll be forced<br/>to use it in order to survive this<br/>place. Five thousand times the Earth's<br/>gravity is no small thing to a Jurian."<p>"So, you're doing this for his<br/>benefit?" she muttered under her breath.<p>"And my own, he'll be more useful if<br/>he can fight well," said Trunks with a<br/>slight agreeing nod. "Plus, I also did<br/>it to placate Ryoko a bit. Tenchi will<br/>help keep her in line once he falls in<br/>with our training. Plus, I want her to<br/>get a bit closer to him. She wants it<br/>pretty badly, and this is a good way to<br/>do it."<p>"Any other reasons?"<p>"He'll appreciate it, and he'll<br/>respect me as his sensei. That's a good<br/>start towards a relationship with Jurai,<br/>especially if he takes up his place as<br/>Emperor one day. If not, it never hurts<br/>to have another friend you can count<br/>on."<p>This caught Hotaru by surprise and<br/>she stared at him for a moment. "So,<br/>you're building a relationship?"<p>"Possibly political, possibly just a<br/>friend, either way, I can't lose." He<br/>smirked at her and turned his head<br/>towards the living area. "Plus, my<br/>daughter really has her heart set on<br/>him. I want to give her an open chance,<br/>she won't have much time to fool around,<br/>despite what she's thinking I'm sure.<br/>However, training with someone the way<br/>they will, will build a relationship<br/>that even Ayeka can't compete with."<p>"Playing matchmaker? That doesn't<br/>seem like you," said Hotaru with a small<br/>sigh.<p>"I agree, but call it sentiment if<br/>you like," he replied with a small<br/>shrug. "She'll respect his skill more<br/>after this as well. She won't feel the<br/>need to protect him as much as she seems<br/>to now. Kagato seems to slip her mind,<br/>but an entire year of training along<br/>side him will probably change that."<p>"What of Ryoko's transformation?"<br/>said Hotaru carefully.<p>"Pardon?" said Trunks as he looked<br/>at her. Her tail was swishing about<br/>behind her somewhat violently.<p>"Ah, saw through me that quickly did<br/>you?" he chuckled. "Yes, I'd like to see<br/>if the effect is the same. I doubt if<br/>it'd affect Tenchi though, just a hunch<br/>on my part."<p>"We'll have to raise her power<br/>levels first," said Hotaru. "It won't<br/>work as she is now, if what you told me<br/>is true."<p>"I know. We'll work on getting her<br/>near your power, and then try the fusion<br/>dance. Maybe it will change her, maybe<br/>not. I'm not sure. She's got my DNA in<br/>her, so there's a good chance she'll<br/>change like you did."<p>"Three of us, as able and true Super<br/>Saiyans will catch them by surprise,"<br/>said Hotaru with a small chuckle.<p>"That's my plan," said Trunks as he<br/>smirked at her. "Ready to start again?"<p>"Anytime," said Hotaru as she<br/>grinned back.<p>"Never expected you to answer that<br/>Nine," replied Trunks casually.<p>The woman's eyes narrowed slightly<br/>as her smirk changed to a frown. "I'm<br/>not strong enough to destroy you yet,<br/>boy. However, I think you're actually<br/>planning on changing that."<p>"You'll never catch up to me,"<br/>snorted Trunks. "Hotaru's Super Saiyan<br/>transformation makes you all stronger,<br/>but you still lack the spirit or will to<br/>beat me, and you'll never get them as<br/>you are now."<p>Nine snorted in disgust and glared<br/>at him. "We'll see," she replied<br/>snidely. "Hotaru's soul darkens a bit<br/>more every day. Soon she'll be mine, and<br/>Saturn won't be able to stop us."<p>This caught Trunks off guard a<br/>little and he narrowed his eyes at her.<br/>"Vengeance?"<p>"Perhaps. She doesn't respect you as<br/>she used to boy. I had thought she had<br/>her heart set on you at one point."<p>"Maybe she did, and it doesn't<br/>concern me much now. I've got more<br/>important things to worry about, and so<br/>do you three. I doubt if Hotaru will<br/>fall enough for you to take over though.<br/>You're dreaming if you think she's like<br/>that."<p>"And you're fooling yourself to<br/>think otherwise," replied Nine<br/>hatefully.<p>"That's enough," replied one of<br/>Hotaru's other personalities. Trunks<br/>couldn't tell which it was. There was a<br/>slight anger in her eyes, and he<br/>couldn't tell if it was directed at him<br/>or Mistress Nine.<p>Trunks sighed and relaxed his<br/>stance. "You'd best be careful Hotaru.<br/>She may be right, Chibi-Usa isn't worth<br/>it. Believe me, she's definitely not<br/>worth it."<p>"I'll decide that," growled Hotaru.<p>"That transformation makes your body<br/>stronger Hotaru. It increases your<br/>power, but you must remember that<br/>Mistress Nine becomes just as strong.<br/>Don't think it will protect you from<br/>her, stay on guard."<p>The seriousness in his tone caused<br/>the girl's anger to abate somewhat and<br/>she simply stared at him for a long<br/>moment.<p>"He is right you know, not even I<br/>can fight you both off, if it comes to<br/>that. I would rather see us destroyed,<br/>and I have the power to do just that,"<br/>said Saturn calmly. "Tread carefully<br/>Hotaru."<p>The girl's face seemed angry and<br/>confused at the same time, she wasn't<br/>sure what to say or do at that moment.<br/>"All right. I understand."<p>"Revenge is nice Hotaru, but it<br/>won't fill the void he left behind. Even<br/>when she's gone, he won't be back. I'll<br/>help you destroy her, but don't think<br/>for a moment that it's worth losing<br/>yourself over." Trunks smiled at her<br/>gently and turned away. "Come on, we'd<br/>better go save Tenchi before my daughter<br/>rapes him or something."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"So, what do you want from me<br/>exactly?" muttered Azusa as he glared<br/>down at Yosho and frowned deeply.<p>"Just a place to train for a few<br/>months. Ayeka has already seen to<br/>everything else we'll need while we're<br/>here," said the man as he stared up at<br/>his father in defiance.<p>"You disappoint me Yosho," said<br/>Azusa with a small tired sigh.<p>"Maybe I do, but the fact remains<br/>that my home is under siege. I cannot<br/>turn my back on it now. I will not<br/>remain, no matter what you say now. We<br/>can discuss that at a later time. This<br/>is not the time for such things."<p>"I'll decide that while you're under<br/>my roof," growled Azusa coldly.<p>"Should we be here?" whispered<br/>Makoto to Usagi nervously. The Senshi<br/>were all standing behind Yosho as he<br/>argued with his father.<p>"I'm not sure, but I'm afraid to<br/>leave right now," replied the girl as<br/>she frowned at the pair in front of her.<p>"I'm inclined to agree with Usagi,"<br/>said Ami as she looked at the pair for a<br/>moment. "We don't want to insult them.<br/>This isn't Japan, this might not be rude<br/>here."<p>"Or it might be, and they just don't<br/>care," replied Rei as she watched the<br/>pair continue to battle verbally.<p>"I saw what Ayeka has acquisitioned.<br/>Metal, enough to build a starship with.<br/>Very expensive and rare metal, along<br/>with several other questionable<br/>materials. Care to explain this Yosho?"<p>"I'm not sure, perhaps she is<br/>building a ship?" replied Yosho calmly.<br/>"I didn't inquire."<p>"It seems odd that she would do<br/>that," commented Azusa irritably. "Is<br/>she not happy with..."<p>"I don't believe she is building it<br/>for herself," said Yosho calmly. "Queen<br/>Serenity's fleet has been unsealed<br/>according to a reliable source. It<br/>wasn't these girls who did it. They do<br/>not yet have the knowledge to do so. I<br/>believe that is why the boy brought us<br/>here."<p>"What?" said Usagi as she turned to<br/>stare at Yosho in shock.<p>The man turned to look at her and<br/>frowned. "Washuu confirmed it after<br/>Trunks told her about it. She thought it<br/>would be a good idea to inform me. They<br/>are roughly three months away from your<br/>planet, according to your time."<p>"The fleet?" muttered Ami as a<br/>distant memory began to form in her<br/>mind. "Oh! Oh no!" she fell to the<br/>ground clutching her head.<p>"What's wrong?" cried Minako as she<br/>knelt down beside her friend.<p>"That fleet..." muttered Ami in<br/>horror.<p>Usagi stared at her blankly. "You<br/>mean...space ships?"<p>"No Usagi. Warships," replied Ami as<br/>she struggled to her feet with Rei and<br/>Minako supporting her. "Warships with<br/>enough firepower to wipe all life off of<br/>the face of the planet. There wouldn't<br/>be any way to defend against it, not<br/>even we could stop it."<p>This caused a moment of dead silence<br/>among the group.<p>"I would not send my fleet against<br/>such a force, not to save a single<br/>planet. The loss of life would be too<br/>great, and we would not be able to stop<br/>them from destroying the planet anyway."<br/>Azusa was firm and cold in his words.<p>Usagi nodded in understanding<br/>though. "I wouldn't ask you too."<p>"Where is the boy?" said Azusa as he<br/>stared at Yosho for a moment.<p>"Tenchi has been missing for some<br/>time now. I'm surprised at the boy, he's<br/>never acted like this before. Ryoko has<br/>not been seen for some time either, I<br/>suspect they are together." Yosho looked<br/>absolutely ashamed at his words and<br/>growled under his breath.<p>Before the Emperor could gloat about<br/>it, Ayeka burst into the room with tears<br/>in her eyes. "Tenchi's been kidnapped!"<p>Everyone turned to stare at her for<br/>a long moment as she simply stood there<br/>panting in the doorway. Her face was<br/>contorted with tears and worry.<p>"What?" said Yosho as he blinked at<br/>her for a moment.<p>"Tenchi, he's been taken away! By<br/>that horrible little boy!" cried the<br/>princess.<p>Washuu walked in behind her calmly.<br/>"Now, now, it's not that bad."<p>"Explain at once!" snapped Yosho<br/>before the Emperor could command the<br/>same thing. Azusa settled in his chair<br/>with a frustrated frown as he glared at<br/>the man for a moment.<p>"Well, he'll only be gone for a<br/>day..." said Washuu as she backed away<br/>slightly. "It's not as bad as it seems."<p>"That monster woman kidnapped my<br/>Tenchi!"<p>Azusa perked his eyebrow at this,<br/>and the princess quieted down quite<br/>suddenly.<p>"He sort of, went into the room I<br/>built for Trunks. They'll come back<br/>tomorrow some time. Around the same time<br/>they went in. It's not a big deal. I<br/>mean..." Washuu seemed to be skirting<br/>around something, most of them could<br/>tell this.<p>"Well, go and get him!" snapped<br/>Ayeka angrily.<p>"I kind of can't," said Washuu<br/>sheepishly. "Once the door is closed,<br/>you can't open it until the day is over.<br/>It's for the safety of the time field<br/>really. It would disrupt everything<br/>around it if we opened it now, and<br/>possibly cause some real damage."<p>"So shut it down," said Rei calmly.<br/>She suddenly wished she hadn't spoken<br/>when everyone looked at her.<p>"I can't," muttered Washuu. "I<br/>didn't have time to build anything more<br/>than the basic features. By the time I<br/>fixed a way to reopen the door without<br/>causing any damage, they'd be out<br/>anyway."<p>"Why would this room, disrupt the<br/>'Time Field'?" said Azusa as he narrowed<br/>his eyes at the woman.<p>"Because it was designed to make a<br/>day last an entire year," replied Washuu<br/>proudly. "It was really a rather<br/>ingenious invention actually. I wish I<br/>had thought of it myself! Trunks asked<br/>me to build it for him on the way here,<br/>it wasn't too difficult, but it was time<br/>consuming. I spent almost the whole trip<br/>on it..." She trailed off when she<br/>realized that no one looked very happy<br/>with her. "What's the problem? He'll<br/>only be gone a day."<p>"An entire year with that monster<br/>woman!" cried Ayeka in horror. She<br/>almost passed out from the sheer shock.<p>"Tenchi..." muttered Yosho with a<br/>small sigh. "How did he end up...?"<p>"I'm not entirely sure, someone must<br/>have closed the door before he left. He<br/>probably went to see Ryoko off or<br/>something," said Washuu with a small<br/>shrug. "Once the door is closed, there's<br/>no way in or out." She withered under<br/>the slightly irritated glares from Ayeka<br/>and the Emperor. Yosho seemed somewhat<br/>calm, and the Senshi didn't appear to<br/>care either way really. "I probably<br/>shouldn't mention the gravity settings,"<br/>she thought to herself with a little<br/>sweat forming on her brow.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Meanwhile, just outside the<br/>atmosphere of the planet...<p>"So, this is Jurai," said the dark<br/>figure as his small round space-pod<br/>stopped in space. It opened up, and a<br/>tiny figure emerged from inside, barely<br/>visible against the light the huge<br/>planet reflected into space. It was just<br/>ahead of the defensive field that<br/>protected Jurai from attack. The shield<br/>would repel a large hostile fleet of<br/>ships, but a single ship with the right<br/>pilot could probably make it through.<br/>Unfortunately, he wasn't that good of a<br/>pilot. Fortunately, he didn't really<br/>need a ship.<p>His tail whipped back and fourth<br/>violently as he smirked at the green<br/>surface of the sphere below him. His<br/>pale and purple skin twitching slightly<br/>as he narrowed his eyes at the jewel of<br/>a planet below. "Now is where I start<br/>having a little fun. Ranma Saotome is<br/>nothing but a little boy, and these<br/>Jurians sound like they might be strong<br/>enough to be a little fun almost. Heh,<br/>I'm going to enjoy this."<p>His power flared and alarms started<br/>to sound inside the satellites that<br/>orbited the planet, keeping the field in<br/>place. Kooler chuckled as he raised his<br/>palm at the nearest one and formed a<br/>small black energy ball in his palm.<br/>"Let's get started, shall we?"<p>The tiny black ball shot forward,<br/>slamming into the side of the satellite.<br/>It exploded in a spectacular ball of<br/>flames that flared just long enough for<br/>the oxygen inside the small machine to<br/>be eaten away. His eyes flicked sideways<br/>and he noticed a larger space station<br/>like base a short distance away. He<br/>smirked and flew towards it. "Ah, my<br/>first kill."<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Alarms sounded all around the<br/>building. Nabiki Tendo stood in the<br/>hallway watching men run around her<br/>towards the halls that lead outside the<br/>palace. "What's going on?" she muttered<br/>to herself as she strolled around.<p>One of the men moved up to her side<br/>and was shortly joined by another. Both<br/>were wearing armor and had a pair of<br/>wooden poles in their grasp. "Miss, I'm<br/>afraid we're going to have to ask you to<br/>return to your quarters."<p>"But...I'm supposed to wait here<br/>for..."<p>"The meeting is about to end I'm<br/>afraid," said the other guard. "Some<br/>fool is attacking the planet. The<br/>Emperor is going to have to cut it<br/>short, it shouldn't take long, but for<br/>your own safety you need to be in your<br/>room. Your friends will join you<br/>shortly."<p>"Attacking the planet?" muttered<br/>Nabiki in confusion.<p>"Yes, it's been over seven hundred<br/>years since someone was fool enough to<br/>try something like this," said one of<br/>the guards with a light smirk. "Don't<br/>worry, there's a reason for that. They<br/>won't pose a problem."<p>Nabiki found herself nodding as she<br/>started walking away. She frowned deeply<br/>as she strolled back towards the<br/>quarters they had been given and glanced<br/>around at the diminishing wave of<br/>soldiers that had seemed to fill the<br/>hall only moments before. After a<br/>moment, she realized that she was alone.<br/>The halls had been quite busy up till<br/>the time the alarm sounded, and now she<br/>was pretty much alone.<p>A soldier ran by her with a panicked<br/>look on his face as he pulled his<br/>armored shoulder pads on as he rushed by<br/>her, obviously late. After a moment of<br/>walking towards her room, she shifted<br/>her direction and turned down another<br/>familiar hallway.<p>She emerged from the palace and onto<br/>the launch pad where the Mikon Taka was<br/>sitting still. She sighed in relief and<br/>walked up to the ship. It was easy to<br/>distinguish the new parts on the ship<br/>with the old ones. Repairs had either<br/>been cut short by the attack, or they<br/>had already been completed. As she<br/>suspected, the ramp was down, and George<br/>was fiddling with something on the<br/>underside of the ship.<p>"George," she called out to him as<br/>she walked up.<p>The man turned to look at her and<br/>frowned. "Eh? Oh, it's you. What do you<br/>want?" He didn't seem upset with her and<br/>dusted off his hands on his spandex<br/>pants.<p>Nabiki gave an involuntary shudder<br/>at his appearance and quickly pushed it<br/>aside for the moment. "Something is<br/>going on. Have you heard anything?"<p>"Not really," replied the man with a<br/>small shrug. "We finished all the major<br/>repairs on the ship last night. I've<br/>been making a few adjustments to occupy<br/>my time though."<p>"That's good to hear," said Nabiki<br/>as she glanced up at the hull above her<br/>head for a moment. "What kind of<br/>communications equipment do you have on<br/>this thing?"<p>"Most of the standard stuff, plus a<br/>few extras. Why?" He smirked at her and<br/>snorted before she could answer. "You<br/>want to find out what's going on?"<p>Nabiki smiled and nodded. "I've got<br/>a bad feeling about this. I heard<br/>someone is attacking the planet."<p>"Jurai? What kind of idiot would<br/>attack Jurai?" said George dumbly.<p>"That's what I'd like to find out,"<br/>said Nabiki.<p>"It's probably already over,"<br/>snorted George as he motioned for her to<br/>follow.<p>Nabiki nodded and walked onto the<br/>ship after him. "Maybe, but if it's<br/>really that stupid to attack this<br/>place...why would someone do it? Unless<br/>they knew that they could."<p>George looked back at her and<br/>nodded. "Actually, I was thinking the<br/>same thing."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Azusa stood up from his throne,<br/>glaring down at the guard kneeling in<br/>front of him in a rage. "WHAT!"<p>"Someone is attacking the planet!"<br/>said the guard fearfully.<p>"Impossible! What kind of idiots<br/>would do such a thing?" he snarled.<p>"We don't know sir, we haven't<br/>gotten a visual confirmation yet!"<br/>replied the man.<p>"Why not?" snarled Azusa. "How can<br/>we not find a fleet of ships right under<br/>our noses!"<p>"It's not a fleet, Your Highness!<br/>It's a single person!" said the man as<br/>he glanced up at the emperor. "We've<br/>caught glimpses of him on our thermal<br/>radar, but no video confirmation for<br/>identification."<p>Azusa went silent. "A single ship?"<p>"No, a single man, Your Highness!"<p>"You're telling me someone is<br/>attacking Jurai from space, with his<br/>bare hands?" said Azusa in disbelief.<p>Yosho frowned deeply. "Who could do<br/>such a thing?"<p>"Even Ryoko had to use Ryo-Ohki,"<br/>said Washuu with a small frown of her<br/>own.<p>"This is preposterous! Impossible!"<p>Usagi stepped forward and frowned.<br/>"You don't think...they came here<br/>because of us do you?"<p>Yosho shook his head. "I doubt it.<br/>Jurai has many enemies."<p>The guard kneeling before the emperor<br/>put his hand against his ear and gasped<br/>in horror. "Sir, the intruder has broken<br/>through the defense shield, he's heading<br/>towards the surface of the planet! Under<br/>his own power!"<p>"Who could do such a thing?"<br/>snapped Azusa angrily. An image appeared<br/>on the wall beside him and he went pale.<br/>"Kooler! It's...the damn Cold family!<br/>They've betrayed us?"<p>"Betrayed?" said Yosho with a small<br/>frown on his face.<p>Azusa ignored him and stared at the<br/>screen in a rage. "Those back stabbing<br/>lizards! How dare they presume they can<br/>destroy us!"<p>"What is that thing?" said Usagi in<br/>horror. A memory of her own tickled the<br/>back of her mind. It wasn't one from her<br/>past life either.<p>"The Cold family are a group of<br/>mercenaries, the depopulate planets and<br/>sell them off as real estate. It's<br/>earned them a rather nasty reputation,<br/>and also made them some of the most<br/>wanted criminals in the galaxy," replied<br/>Yosho calmly. "Disgusting pirates, but<br/>very powerful warriors."<p>"I'll put a stop to this," growled<br/>Azusa angrily. "Those idiots aren't<br/>stupid enough to try and oppose us. I<br/>don't see how this could have happened!"<p>Yosho narrowed his eyes at the man<br/>for a moment and turned away. "I see."<p>Azusa frowned at him and stormed by<br/>the group gathered in front of him<br/>through the doors of the throne room. "I<br/>doubt that Yosho."<p>"Ashikara, the Jewel of the Juraian<br/>Empire. Second only to Jurai itself in<br/>beauty. I had often wondered, why such a<br/>planet with so much beauty, had no<br/>inhabitants. When I was a boy, we had a<br/>palace built there, so that the royal<br/>family could enjoy the summers there."<p>"What are you talking about?"<br/>muttered Usagi dumbly.<p>"He wouldn't," muttered Washuu as<br/>she stared at Yosho.<p>"There was a time, I would have<br/>agreed with you," said the man calmly as<br/>he turned to stare at her. "Now do you<br/>understand why I would not remain here?<br/>Why I had no wish for Tenchi to know of<br/>his true heritage? I admit, even I never<br/>truly suspected he was capable of this.<br/>Still, I often wondered."<p>Rei seemed to be the first one to<br/>understand what they were talking about.<br/>"Oh...oh no..."<p>"Come, we will go back to our rooms<br/>for now. The sooner we are away from<br/>this place, the better," said Yosho with<br/>a disgusted sounding snort.<p>"Brother..." muttered Ayeka softly.<br/>It seemed she was truly hurt by his<br/>words, but she dared not say anything<br/>else to him as he walked by him.<p>"You knew about this?" said Makoto<br/>as she walked up to the girl and stared<br/>at her with a barely disguised anger.<p>"No. I had no idea, but..."<p>"You suspected as well?" asked Ami<br/>with a small understanding nod.<p>"Never anything like this," she said<br/>as she shook her head for a moment.<br/>"Relocation maybe, but the Cold family?<br/>Oh father, how could you?"<p>"And relocation is any better?"<br/>grumbled Washuu under her breath as she<br/>walked away. The practice of relocation<br/>was expensive; inhabitants rarely did so<br/>on their own, and were often moved to a<br/>place where the atmosphere would sustain<br/>them. Little else was considered, such<br/>as food, or environments that<br/>complimented the species, or even the<br/>amount of space needed for the size of a<br/>population. After all, if they could<br/>breathe, what else did they need?<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks smiled as he floated past<br/>Ryoko's defenses easily. "Not bad."<p>"You little punk! I'll make you pay<br/>for locking me up in this prison!" she<br/>snarled angrily as she continued to<br/>attack.<p>"Heh, you're dreaming if you think<br/>you can even come close to beating me<br/>like that," snorted the boy as he caught<br/>her wrist and stopped her attack cold.<br/>She whirled around and connected with a<br/>kick. He made no move to stop her and<br/>smirked as the attack had no effect,<br/>aside from really hurting Ryoko.<p>"Augh! Damn it!" she cried in anger.<p>"Heh, transform, and you'll at least<br/>have the strength to hurt me. You've<br/>done it before, it shouldn't be that<br/>difficult for you now." Trunks frowned<br/>as he glared at her for a moment and<br/>noticed the frustration on her face.<p>"Why should I bother? Once I get my<br/>gems back..."<p>"You'll ignore those under powered<br/>rocks, because when I'm through, you<br/>won't need them," replied Trunks as his<br/>maddening grin widened suddenly. "Come<br/>on Ryoko, you can do it."<p>"What good was it? Kagato still beat<br/>me!" she snarled.<p>"You're still on about that? You<br/>couldn't use the power you'd gained<br/>fool! You were vastly superior to him in<br/>strength and power. I'm still not sure<br/>how he was able to match that speed<br/>though..." He looked thoughtful for a<br/>moment and noticed the woman was glaring<br/>at him.<p>"How would you know anything about<br/>that?" she snarled.<p>"I read about it," he lied.<p>Ryoko growled at that and turned her<br/>head away. "Well, you read wrong. Kagato<br/>was very powerful."<p>"Kagato had a base power of around<br/>fifteen hundred on his own, Shouja is<br/>what made him dangerous. Your first<br/>transformation was twenty five hundred<br/>easy." He blinked as she stared at him<br/>again. "In my future, Washuu developed a<br/>rating system for power levels based on<br/>a numerical ranking system. She used<br/>that battle as one of her test<br/>theories." Another lie, impossible to<br/>disprove or verify. This future thing<br/>was fun!<p>"Was I really stronger?" she<br/>muttered under her breath.<p>Trunks chuckled at this reaction and<br/>put up his fists. "Why don't you<br/>transform again and find out?"<p>"Maybe I will then!" snarled Ryoko<br/>as she attacked again.<p>Trunks frowned slightly from behind<br/>his fists as he reacted to her attack.<br/>"She's still not there yet! Damn."<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Fire surrounded him, the pained<br/>screams of the dying floated in the air<br/>as he hovered above the burning surface<br/>of the planet. His arms were spread wide<br/>in an almost euphoric joy. "Ah, the<br/>feeling is so wonderful! So much to<br/>kill! So little time!"<p>The burned wreckage of a Juraian<br/>cruiser slowly crumbled into the ground<br/>behind him, a huge cloud of smoke<br/>billowing into the sky as it crashed<br/>into an area of the city. Thousands<br/>would die in the resulting explosion.<br/>"Where are you! I know you're here, I<br/>know you know I'm here! Come out and<br/>play little one! When I'm through with<br/>you, my fun can really begin!"<p>"Kooler! Enough of this!" snarled an<br/>angry sounding voice just below him.<p>The alien looked down at the man<br/>below him, a cold smirk forming on his<br/>face as he returned the intense glare<br/>with a cool and casual glance. "Oh, and<br/>who might you be?"<p>"What are you doing fool? How dare<br/>you attack us? I'll see you and your<br/>whole retched family destroyed for<br/>this!"<p>"You must be the Emperor of Jurai!<br/>I'll admit, I'm impressed." Kooler<br/>chuckled as he floated down in front of<br/>the man.<p>Azusa had his sword drawn, the blade<br/>of light hummed with power as he snarled<br/>at the thing in front of him angrily.<br/>"You! How dare you! Pathetic worm, you<br/>can't even begin to stand up to the<br/>power of Jurai!"<p>Kooler snorted as he narrowed his<br/>eyes and returned the glare this time.<br/>"You? Beat me? I think not Juraian<br/>Emperor. I am the ultimate power in the<br/>universe. You're too reliant on this<br/>planet. Perhaps I should just destroy it<br/>and cut off your power source?"<p>"Not even you have the power to do<br/>that," snorted Azusa in what appeared to<br/>be amusement.<p>"Really?" snorted Kooler as his<br/>smirk widened. "I suppose I shouldn't be<br/>able to touch you either then? Hmmm. I<br/>wonder..." He formed a tiny pinprick of<br/>black light on his fingertip and looked<br/>at it for a moment. "Come Emperor of<br/>Jurai, let's test your power then."<p>"You dare?" snarled Azusa angrily.<br/>"Very well! I'll destroy you!" He closed<br/>his eyes and began to focus his power on<br/>his blade. A visible shield of energy<br/>formed around his body as he prepared to<br/>attack.<p>Kooler snorted and flicked his<br/>finger forward lightly. After a moment,<br/>nothing appeared to have happened.<p>Azusa's face had turned into a mask<br/>of anger though, he snarled hatefully at<br/>the thing in front of him and a group of<br/>men started to swarm around them like<br/>bees. "Get back! All of you!" snarled<br/>Azusa as sweat began to form on is brow.<br/>He appeared to be white as a sheet now.<br/>A single line of blood formed on his<br/>cheek that started to run down his face.<br/>"Impossible!"<p>"What's the matter? Not feeling so<br/>invincible anymore?" chuckled Kooler in<br/>amusement. "That shield of yours is<br/>impressive, I'll admit it. However, it's<br/>no match for my power." He glanced<br/>around. "The Juraian army? How nice of<br/>you to gather them all in one place for<br/>me! I'm so glad I don't have to hunt<br/>them all down." He reared back his head<br/>and started to laugh as he raised his<br/>palm over his head and formed a huge<br/>ball of darkness there.<p>Azusa's eyes went wide and he gasped<br/>in horror. "No!"<p>A huge explosion of dark energy<br/>could be seen from orbit, it engulfed a<br/>huge portion of the surface of the<br/>planet, leaving behind a large brown<br/>area of dirt and death.<p>Kooler chuckled as he floated down<br/>towards the base of the crater. The<br/>palace could be seen in the distance,<br/>just outside the destruction. It went on<br/>as far as the eye could see in every<br/>other direction. Nothing stood now, no<br/>trees, no life, nothing.<p>The alien paused as he stared down<br/>into the dust, and saw movement below<br/>him. He grinned and landed next to the<br/>broken and bleeding form of the Emperor.<br/>"Well, that certainly is impressive<br/>Emperor of Jurai."<p>"Monster!" growled Azusa weakly as<br/>he rolled onto his back and stared at<br/>the thing hatefully.<p>Kooler placed one of his feet on the<br/>man's chest and leaned in, pinning him<br/>to the ground. "I should really kill<br/>you. It would be rather stupid of me to<br/>let you live. However, I think I'll<br/>enjoy leaving you alone on a dead planet<br/>after I destroy everything!"<p>"Why?" muttered Azusa. "We have<br/>always supported your family? Why have<br/>you betrayed us?"<p>"Betrayed? I don't recall ever<br/>having an alliance with you Azusa. We<br/>were to disgusting and vile for such a<br/>relationship. Something to be used when<br/>it was convenient as I recall. Now,<br/>well, let's just say I've come to find<br/>someone. After I'm through with him,<br/>I'll worry about killing the rest of<br/>your pathetic planet."<p>Azusa gasped for breath under the<br/>weight of the thing's foot. Kooler's<br/>grin widened as he narrowed his eyes at<br/>the man for a moment. "You don't even<br/>realize what's going on do you? It's<br/>pathetically simple, but just beyond<br/>your grasp."<p>The Emperor growled angrily at this<br/>and turned his head aside. He had<br/>several broken bones, and couldn't even<br/>crawl away. To put it simply, he was<br/>helpless. "You won't destroy this<br/>planet, it will destroy you before that<br/>happens."<p>"If you mean Tsunami, and I<br/>certainly hope you're referring to<br/>something more interesting, then you<br/>should know that I am more powerful than<br/>that pathetic starship could ever be<br/>offensively. The wings of the Light Hawk<br/>cannot protect the planet from something<br/>that is already on it."<p>Azusa knew he was right, the Light<br/>Hawk wings could do little more than<br/>protect a single place for a short time.<br/>They were invulnerable, but took an<br/>enormous amount of power to call. Even<br/>if they used them offensively, Kooler<br/>was far too small and agile for there to<br/>be much hope of harming him with the<br/>blast.<p>"We'll destroy the planet then, and<br/>take you with it," snarled Azusa<br/>angrily.<p>"Even Frieza could survive the<br/>destruction of a planet, do you honestly<br/>think I couldn't as well? Stop simpering<br/>you pathetic wretch, you're beaten. Once<br/>I have what I want, I'll see about<br/>tormenting your people for a while<br/>before moving on. After all, there's<br/>nothing you can do to stop me."<p>Kooler floated into the air, a<br/>confident smirk chiseled into his<br/>features as he floated off in search of<br/>his target. "Now, where is Ranma<br/>Saotome?"<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks glared forward with his<br/>student pushing herself to the limits,<br/>her hair still the same color as it was<br/>before, but now with slightly red roots.<br/>"Damn it!" cried Ryoko in frustration.<p>"Remember that feeling! Ryoko,<br/>you're getting stronger, but you're not<br/>going to be able to keep up if you don't<br/>get this! Remember when you thought<br/>Tenchi died! You have to unlock the<br/>secret!" growled the boy as he landed<br/>and prepared for her next assault.<p>Ryoko's eyes went wide as she hung<br/>in the air. "Tenchi...No! I don't want<br/>to remember that!" she growled<br/>defiantly.<p>Trunks narrowed his eyes at her and<br/>felt something shift in the air. "Come<br/>on...you can do it!" he muttered to<br/>himself as he lowered his guard and<br/>started to move back.<p>"I'll do it without that horrible<br/>memory! I'll never lose my Tenchi<br/>again!" she cried into the sky. Her eyes<br/>became a deep cobalt blue and she turned<br/>her gaze towards Trunks. She glared at<br/>him hatefully and snarled. "Never. I'll<br/>never let that happen again! Do you hear<br/>me?"<p>The boy smiled in reply, his aura<br/>flaring to life in an instant, changing<br/>his hair and blasting outward. "I hear<br/>you Ryoko, now...are you ready for some<br/>real training?"<p>The woman blinked at this and stared<br/>at him. "What?" she muttered it somewhat<br/>dumbly.<p>"Come on, now that this is over<br/>with, we can really get started," said<br/>Trunks as he put up his fists and<br/>floated towards her.<p>Ryoko looked at her hands and<br/>gasped, a golden field of power seemed<br/>to surge across her skin, barely<br/>contained within her. "This is..."<p>"Pay attention! We've got work to<br/>do!" snarled Trunks as he charged<br/>forward.<p>Ryoko glanced up at him and shot<br/>forward like a bullet. "I'll show you!"<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>"What should we do?" asked Nabiki as<br/>she watched George as he stared at the<br/>communications panel on the dash of the<br/>Mikon Taka.<p>"Run," replied the man calmly.<p>"You know anything about this<br/>'Kooler'?" she inquired.<p>"Yes, it's a faded memory, but the<br/>Cold family was around even in the<br/>Silver Millenium. They're nasty pirates,<br/>and we shouldn't be anywhere near them.<br/>He could destroy this whole planet<br/>pretty easily." He glanced at her and<br/>noticed her frown.<p>"You know, Ranma used to watch a lot<br/>of Dragon Ball Z. This is unnerving,"<br/>she commented idly to herself. "We<br/>should go get the others."<p>"It would be better to just leave,<br/>Kooler could get fed up and destroy this<br/>place any time he felt like it. The<br/>Juraians are already evacuating." He<br/>nodded towards another screen, thousands<br/>of small dots filled the image, showing<br/>the ships leaving planet.<p>"Leave them behind?" she asked with<br/>a sort of thoughtful frown on her face.<p>"I'm just giving you our options, I<br/>was never one for giving orders," he<br/>replied calmly.<p>"I thought you were some big time<br/>movie producer," she snorted as she<br/>leveled a small glare at him.<p>"This is nothing like making a<br/>movie," he replied calmly.<p>Nabiki nodded and turned towards the<br/>exit. "We should go get the others." She<br/>didn't walk outside though and simply<br/>stared at the ramp.<p>"They know about this, I'm sure," he<br/>replied calmly. "We'll wait as long as<br/>we can, if things get too hot, we'll<br/>take off."<p>Nabiki glanced back at him and then<br/>to the door again. "I guess you're<br/>right." She turned back inside and sat<br/>down at the table to wait.<p>Artemis jumped up onto the seat next<br/>to her and she jumped. "What are you<br/>doing here?" inquired the cat.<p>"I could ask the same of you!" she<br/>snapped in shock.<p>"I don't like Jurai. The nobles here<br/>have a nasty habit of keeping large,<br/>stupid, dog like pets," replied the<br/>animal calmly.<p>Nabiki calmed somewhat and frowned<br/>at him. "You know what's going on?"<p>The animal nodded. "I overheard."<p>"I'm surprised you haven't run off<br/>after your friends," she said to him<br/>with a slight frown.<p>"You're no better. Besides, I have<br/>faith in them," he said with a serious<br/>looking nod. "The Senshi are stronger<br/>than you think."<p>Nabiki snorted at this. "From what<br/>I've heard, Ranma was handing them their<br/>behinds."<p>Artemis shook his head and sighed.<br/>"I know, but they always came through.<br/>It's only a matter of time, and time is<br/>on our side."<p>"Pluto?" asked Nabiki. She'd heard a<br/>lot of stories over the course of the<br/>voyage.<p>"Yes. Although I didn't mean it<br/>quite that literally."<p>The girl slumped down slightly and<br/>stared at the door. "I hope they come<br/>back soon, this is making me nervous."<p>"I hope the same thing, Luna isn't<br/>fool enough to let them try and take on<br/>one of the Cold family," replied the<br/>cat. "Don't worry."<p>Nabiki didn't feel that comforted by<br/>those words.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks chuckled as Ryoko blasted at<br/>him with a beam of power, he dove out of<br/>the way and spun around, tossing a small<br/>ball of ki at her that exploded on<br/>impact. Ryoko was ready for attack again<br/>after uncrossing her arms from the<br/>block.<p>"Not bad kid," she snorted<br/>irritably.<p>Trunks nodded and floated down<br/>towards the ground. "I could say the<br/>same of you, you're ready."<p>"Ready? We can..." she glanced<br/>towards the doorway.<p>"So, you realized something was<br/>going on outside did you?" he asked as<br/>his smirk fell slightly. "There isn't<br/>anything we can do until our time here<br/>is over. You'll just have to wait I'm<br/>afraid."<p>"I thought you said..." she snapped.<p>"You're ready for the next phase of<br/>your training, tomorrow, you'll go with<br/>Hotaru, and I'll take Tenchi for his own<br/>training. There's more to that<br/>transformation than you realize."<p>Ryoko growled, but nodded. "What<br/>more can there be?"<p>"Heh, you're only at the first<br/>level, I haven't even been using half my<br/>power up to this point Ryoko. You're<br/>about to break through, but there's<br/>something else we need you to learn. A<br/>trump card if you will." His eyes<br/>sparkled with a mischief that promised<br/>her pain.<p>"I don't like that look," she<br/>replied irritably.<p>"Heh, it won't hurt much, not this<br/>time," he snorted as he nodded towards<br/>the area where Hotaru and Tenchi were<br/>training. "In about a month, we'll start<br/>training together, it shouldn't take you<br/>long to learn this."<p>That caught the woman by surprise<br/>and she frowned. "So what are we going<br/>to do?"<p>"I guess we can go watch Tenchi<br/>train for a while. You haven't been able<br/>to spend much time groping him over the<br/>past few months."<p>"Why you!" snarled Ryoko.<p>"You'll keep quiet, and stay away<br/>from him until Hotaru is done with him,"<br/>said Trunks with a frown that told her<br/>of how serious he was. "Tenchi is<br/>training just as hard as you are, and I<br/>don't want you being stupid and trying<br/>to save him. Got me?"<p>"Save him from what?" growled Ryoko.<p>"Come on, follow me and you'll see,"<br/>he replied calmly.<p>The pair flew at top speed for about<br/>five minutes and stopped suddenly. Ryoko<br/>frowned as she glanced around and saw<br/>two tiny specks below them. "Is that?"<p>Trunks nodded and smirked. Ryoko's<br/>eyes were wide with something similar to<br/>shock. "What? What's this power? I knew<br/>it was here...but..."<p>"Jurai has impressed me more than I<br/>had anticipated, Tenchi is coming along<br/>nicely," replied the boy as he nodded at<br/>her surprise. "He still won't beat<br/>myself or Hotaru, but he'll give you a<br/>run for your money."<p>Ryoko nodded at this and started to<br/>float a little lower. Trunks watched her<br/>closely, but she stopped after coming to<br/>a comfortable distance and merely<br/>watched. He heard her growl at what she<br/>saw, but she still remained away from<br/>the battle below.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>"Haaaaaaaa!" cried Tenchi as he<br/>jumped into the air and shifted his<br/>weight to counter Hotaru's punch. The<br/>girl smirked as she flipped backwards<br/>and kicked him in his chest. The boy<br/>flew to the ground and something<br/>shimmered for a moment. He was dressed<br/>in his Juraian armor, but it was haggard<br/>and worn looking.<p>"Not bad, but you're still not fast<br/>enough," she said calmly as she landed<br/>lightly and formed a ball of power in<br/>her hands. "You've got to be quicker on<br/>the release."<p>Tenchi narrowed his eyes and stood<br/>up. "You're right."<p>"You've been pretty agreeable since<br/>we came here boy," said Hotaru as she<br/>smirked at him.<p>"You're not old enough to call me<br/>boy," he replied calmly.<p>"I'm older than you think!" she<br/>snapped as she blasted him with the wave<br/>of power that had been forming in her<br/>palm.<p>The boy stood calmly, in a relaxed<br/>position as the wave simply passed<br/>around him, leaving him unharmed. His<br/>face was calm, but firm. He was<br/>completely focused on his training, a<br/>sight those who knew him rarely saw. His<br/>grandfather was the only one besides<br/>Hotaru who knew this face intimately.<br/>"Good shot."<p>"I thought so too," she replied with<br/>a small chuckle as the energy<br/>boomeranged around behind his back and<br/>slammed into him. He didn't react in<br/>time and was thrown across the ground in<br/>the explosion.<p>"You're not paying attention," she<br/>chided calmly. Saturn's icy mask<br/>appeared to scold him, Hotaru seemed to<br/>actually be enjoying herself, and Nine<br/>was completely absent for the training.<br/>Trunks knew it was mostly because she<br/>thought of it as a waste of time, time<br/>they could be spending bettering<br/>themselves.<p>"That's enough," said Trunks as he<br/>landed in between the pair.<p>"Tenchi!" cried Ryoko as she flew<br/>into him, not bothering to power down.<p>The boy spun around in a defensive<br/>stance, but relaxed before she dove onto<br/>his neck and hung from him. "Hello<br/>Ryoko," he said with a small sigh.<p>"I wasn't expecting you today," said<br/>Hotaru as she smirked at Trunks for a<br/>moment.<p>"I know, Ryoko's ready for the next<br/>level," replied Trunks calmly. He nodded<br/>at Tenchi and then glanced back at<br/>Hotaru.<p>"He's doing better than we<br/>expected," she replied with a small<br/>chuckle. "The power is second nature to<br/>him now, I doubt he realizes it."<br/>Neither of the students heard this, as<br/>Tenchi was busily pushing off Ryoko's<br/>advances. He was doing surprisingly<br/>well, despite her newfound power. "The<br/>Wings of the Light Hawk are giving him a<br/>bit of trouble still. He's still got a<br/>rather short reaction time."<p>Trunks nodded at this and looked him<br/>up and down. The boy was well muscled<br/>now, it was easy to see with his<br/>tattered armor. "Heh. Those two still<br/>think we're at five hundred?"<p>"Neither of them suspect," replied<br/>Hotaru.<p>"We're running out of room to move<br/>the gravity up. Another month and we'll<br/>be working at full power again."<p>Hotaru nodded at this and looked<br/>over at Ryoko. "The dance?"<p>"Yes, she's as far as she'll go as<br/>she is now. She's pushing on the second<br/>transformation. I'm worried her body<br/>won't be able to take it."<p>"If she doesn't react the same?"<br/>inquired Hotaru.<p>"She will," said Trunks without a<br/>hint of worry in his voice.<p>"Are you certain?" asked Hotaru.<p>"Yes, I checked on it," he said as<br/>he glanced at her.<p>"Washuu?" asked Hotaru with a small<br/>amount of curiosity in her voice.<p>"No, her aura matches yours closely.<br/>She's already started," he replied<br/>calmly. "I'm not sure why, but I've got<br/>an idea who had a hand in it."<p>Hotaru assumed he meant Washuu and<br/>didn't press the matter any further.<p>"So, three of our kind?" asked<br/>Hotaru.<p>"Yes. Tenchi and the Juraians, I'm<br/>still working on that, but I don't think<br/>they should be there. This planet is<br/>going to need a lot of work after this<br/>training is over. I'm going to ask them<br/>to remain for a while."<p>Hotaru frowned at this. "So. You<br/>noticed as well?"<p>Trunks merely nodded.<p>"You realize that you're depriving<br/>us of some very valuable and battle<br/>worthy allies," she said as she turned<br/>her head away.<p>"This is personal, for the both of<br/>us," he said as he turned away and<br/>started to float in the air. "Come on,<br/>we should get back and eat."<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Yosho frowned as he strolled through<br/>the halls of the palace with a<br/>determined frown on his face.<p>"No! You can't!" cried Ayeka as she<br/>followed after him with the senshi<br/>trailing behind her.<p>"Ayeka, this is not the first time I<br/>have gone off in defense of this planet<br/>against such an evil," said Yosho.<p>"Look what happened last time!" she<br/>snapped.<p>"What? He found happiness?" said<br/>Usagi dumbly.<p>"No! He vanished for hundreds of<br/>years!" snapped Ayeka. She quickly<br/>turned back to her brother. "Don't do<br/>this! Father is..."<p>"Probably dead," replied Yosho<br/>calmly.<p>"That means you're the Emperor now!<br/>You can't go..."<p>"Ayeka!" snapped Yosho firmly as he<br/>turned to face her. "I have no desire to<br/>be the Emperor of an asteroid field. I<br/>will go and face Kooler, and you will<br/>take these girls and leave."<p>"What?" said Rei as she stared at<br/>him.<p>"No way! We're fighting too!" agreed<br/>Makoto.<p>"Um...we are?" said Usagi as she<br/>stared at her friends for a moment.<p>"Usagi, we can't just let this<br/>happen to these people," said Ami<br/>quietly.<p>"No, your hearts are admirable, but<br/>you are not strong enough to help me. If<br/>you come, I will be forced to protect<br/>you. I cannot afford that." He turned<br/>away from them, trying his best not too<br/>look back.<p>"No! You can't do this alone!" said<br/>Minako in horror.<p>"That's enough!" snapped Luna<br/>suddenly. Everyone looked at her. "We<br/>have a mission of our own. Trunks can't<br/>help us at the moment, so we need to<br/>stay alive!""<p>"Luna! How could you?" cried Usagi.<p>"No! I'm not about to let you run<br/>off to fight one of the Cold family!<br/>You'll be destroyed! The youma you've<br/>been fighting are nothing to one of<br/>those monsters!"<p>This caused the girls to become<br/>silent.<p>"She is right," agreed Yosho calmly.<br/>"I am sorry, but this is my planet, and<br/>my responsibility. I must fight." He<br/>turned and walked on alone.<p>"Are we just going to stand here?"<br/>cried Makoto as Ayeka started to sob.<br/>The princess didn't attempt to follow<br/>anymore though.<p>"Yes, we are," said Luna.<p>"We should...go back to the ship,"<br/>said Ami numbly. It was clear that she<br/>was as upset as the rest of the senshi.<p>"You're right!" agreed Usagi<br/>suddenly. "We'll get there much faster<br/>if we use the ship!"<p>The girls started walking towards<br/>the dock. Luna skittered after them<br/>calling to them as best she could. "No!<br/>Don't! Come back here!"<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Um. What is this?" asked Ryoko as<br/>Hotaru stood in the final pose of the<br/>fusion dance.<p>"This is our next mission," replied<br/>Saturn's icy cool demeanor.<p>"Dance lessons? Is this some kind of<br/>joke?" muttered Ryoko angrily. She was<br/>about to fly away when Hotaru appeared<br/>in front of her.<p>"No. This training looks stupid, I<br/>know that, but it will boost our power.<br/>It will make us almost twice as strong,<br/>possibly three times as much."<p>"What? That's crazy!" snapped Ryoko.<p>"It is the truth, I have experienced<br/>the fusion myself. It is no joke,"<br/>replied Hotaru calmly. "It works."<p>"So? What do we need this power<br/>boost for?"<p>"Ranma will also know of this technique,<br/>and Chibi-Usa is more than willing to<br/>accommodate him I'll wager," replied<br/>Hotaru calmly. "We will begin now."<p>Ryoko growled irritably, but made no<br/>move to leave.<p>The girl nodded at her student's<br/>compliance and spoke again. "We must<br/>learn this correctly. If we do not get<br/>it right, it will make us weaker instead<br/>of stronger. That is not acceptable."<p>Ryoko blinked at this and stared at<br/>her. "Um...okay..."<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>"So, Tenchi, how ya been?" asked<br/>Trunks as he backhanded the boy in his<br/>face.<p>"What?" muttered Tenchi as he<br/>staggered back and blinked.<p>"How's it been going? Enjoying the<br/>training?" asked Trunks as he continued<br/>to attack, oblivious to his opponent's<br/>beating almost.<p>"Fine I guess," muttered Tenchi<br/>after he took a blow to the gut. He<br/>hadn't summoned the Wings of the Light<br/>Hawk, as per Trunks's instructions.<br/>"What is this training anyway?"<p>"This is banter class," said Trunks<br/>cheerfully as he shoved Tenchi face<br/>first into the ground.<p>"Banter?" muttered the boy as he<br/>staggered to his feet and took a kick in<br/>his face.<p>"Yes, you have to be able to have<br/>dramatic dialogue while getting the shit<br/>kicked out of you," said Trunks with a<br/>sagely nod. "It's very important. You've<br/>got to be able to create meaningful<br/>dialogue and shit talking in the midst<br/>of battle. It makes them more epic."<p>"Okay," muttered the suitably beaten<br/>Tenchi with a slight slur in his voice.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Yosho frowned as he stood in the<br/>crater that remained of a portion of one<br/>of Jurai's major cities. "Kooler," he<br/>said icily as he stared the thing down.<br/>It was floating overhead and smirking at<br/>him.<p>"Ah, you must be Yosho," said the<br/>thing calmly. "Welcome to hell."<p>"Humph, I've come to destroy you<br/>monster," snorted the man as a sword<br/>came to life in his hands. The Tenchi-<br/>ken.<p>"What? You think a mere key will be<br/>enough to defeat me?" snorted the thing<br/>in disgust. "Your power is nowhere near<br/>my own. You've come to join your Emperor<br/>in death."<p>Azusa was lying on the ground<br/>nearby, crawling towards them with an<br/>angry looking frown on his face. His<br/>power was gone, and there was nothing he<br/>could do but stare hatefully on the<br/>ground. "Monster! I won't..."<p>"You'll do nothing but watch me<br/>destroy everything," said Kooler in what<br/>appeared to be amusement for a moment.<br/>"Weak fools."<p>"What do you want here?" asked<br/>Yosho.<p>"Ranma Saotome," replied Kooler.<p>"He is on Earth," said Yosho as he<br/>readied himself.<p>"Oh? The boy didn't tell you did he?<br/>I wonder how he convinced you to come<br/>here? It's no concern of mine, I suppose<br/>you wouldn't really know. He's quite<br/>wily."<p>"What are you talking about?"<br/>snarled Yosho.<p>"Maybe you'll figure it out if you<br/>live long enough," said Kooler calmly as<br/>he landed on the ground between the<br/>fallen Emperor and Yosho. "Somehow I<br/>doubt that. Tell me Azusa...should I<br/>kill him slowly? Make you watch him<br/>die?"<p>Yosho growled and continued to wait<br/>for the attack. He had no illusions<br/>about attacking first. His only strategy<br/>was staying alive long enough to find an<br/>opening.<p>"I think I will," said Kooler as his<br/>smile widened. He rushed forward, there<br/>was nothing Yosho could do to defend<br/>himself.<p>The man was thrown into the air by<br/>the first blow. The attacks kept him<br/>suspended hundreds of feet above the<br/>ground, far to fast for him to defend<br/>himself against. He tried, fighting<br/>valiantly by swinging his sword despite<br/>the blows. His energy shield seemed<br/>completely useless.<p>Yosho paused and landed on the<br/>ground with a dull thud. He rose to his<br/>feet and glared at the thing standing<br/>over him.<p>"Still able to move? I'm impressed.<br/>This could be more fun than I had<br/>thought," said Kooler with a small<br/>chuckle.<p>"My shield?" muttered Yosho as he<br/>realized that he had been using it.<br/>"He's going through it as if it wasn't<br/>there? No!" He glanced up again and<br/>allowed the shield to fail. "He's<br/>draining the power from it! How?"<p>"Figured that out did you?" said<br/>Kooler as he narrowed his eyes. "No<br/>matter, not even you can fight the full<br/>power of your own planet Yosho!" Kooler<br/>raised his arms and a soft glow began to<br/>form around his body.<p>Yosho gasped in horror as he saw the<br/>plant life in the distance become brown<br/>instantaneously. "What? This<br/>is...impossible!"<p>"Heh. You're no match for me, give<br/>up and die now. I'm through playing with<br/>you, you're not amusing anymore," said<br/>Kooler with his smirk widening. "One<br/>blow, and you'll be gone forever!" A<br/>black ball of power formed on his finger<br/>and his eyes went wild.<p>There was an explosion, and<br/>everything went white. Yosho collapsed<br/>on the ground as his strength gave out.<br/>"What happened?"<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Well, this is it," said Trunks as<br/>he smiled at the trio standing in front<br/>of him. "We're halfway done."<p>Ryoko watched him irritably, her<br/>hair gold and the tail that hung from<br/>the back of her skirt now wagged<br/>irritably. "What is it this time you<br/>loon?" she snapped angrily.<p>"Today, you're going to start<br/>training with Tenchi," replied Trunks.<br/>"Hotaru and I are going to train as<br/>well. This trip wasn't just for you<br/>two."<p>Ryoko nodded and looked at Tenchi.<br/>"Tenchi! Isn't this great! We get<br/>too..."<p>"You get to train," interrupted<br/>Trunks. "I'll be watching you. If you<br/>aren't training, and seriously, I'll<br/>pair us up again. That means no holding<br/>back." His frown silenced Ryoko, and<br/>Tenchi looked slightly relieved. "What<br/>you do on your off time at night is your<br/>own business though," said the boy with<br/>a playful wink at Ryoko. "You're on the<br/>honor system, but don't think for a<br/>moment Hotaru and I don't know exactly<br/>what you're doing."<p>Ryoko snorted and turned her head<br/>away from the pair. "Yes dad," she<br/>muttered in disgust.<p>Trunks blinked at this and shook his<br/>head.<p>"She knows?" whispered Hotaru.<p>"She was being sarcastic," said<br/>Trunks in reply.<p>"Oh," said the girl as she blinked<br/>at him and turned away. "Well, we should<br/>go."<p>"Yeah," agreed Trunks as he moved<br/>after her.<p>Ryoko turned to Tenchi and smiled.<br/>"So?"<p>The boy blushed. "I guess we should<br/>get started."<p>Ryoko nodded and sighed. "I wonder<br/>why they did this?"<p>"I think it's so we can get some<br/>practice in, fighting different<br/>opponents then we're used too..."<br/>ventured Tenchi.<p>Ryoko shrugged and jumped at him.<br/>"Who cares! You're mine!" She spread her<br/>arms wide and grinned devilishly.<p>She blinked at the blade that<br/>appeared between herself and the boy.<br/>"Sorry Ryoko, but we're here to train,<br/>remember?"<p>This caught her off guard and she<br/>faltered in mid air. Tenchi tensed his<br/>body and charged at her. "Get ready<br/>Ryoko!"<p>"Tenchi?" muttered the woman in<br/>confusion as she backed away. Slowly,<br/>her face contorted into a grin. "We can<br/>play again! Just like when we first<br/>met!"<p>"I might enjoy the game more this<br/>time," replied the boy with a slight<br/>confidence in his tone that she'd never<br/>heard before.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>"AAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!"<br/>cried Kooler as he reeled from a shot<br/>from behind. "What the?" He spun and<br/>glared at the offender with a rage in<br/>his eyes.<p>"A class criminal Kooler! You're<br/>under arrest!" cried Mihoshi as she<br/>leveled her firearm at the alien.<p>"What the?" said Kooler dumbly.<br/>"She...?"<p>"In the name of the Galaxy Police,<br/>and the Emperor of Jurai, I'm placing<br/>you under arrest! Please keep your hands<br/>in the air and..."<p>"You little imp! How dare you attack<br/>me!" snarled Kooler as he stared at her<br/>in shock. His eyes fell on the pistol in<br/>her grip and he frowned. "There's no way<br/>that should have hurt me this much!" His<br/>back was still slightly irritated by the<br/>shot.<p>Mihoshi leveled the weapon on him<br/>and fired again. A huge beam of power<br/>shot from the nozzle and he shifted to<br/>avoid it easily. "That's not..." he<br/>muttered to himself.<p>"Don't move!" snapped Mihoshi with a<br/>firm frown on her face. Beside her was a<br/>small take out box that lay at her feet.<p>"I'll just destroy you!" snapped<br/>Kooler as he charged up another bolt of<br/>power and fired it at her. Mihoshi<br/>shrieked and jumped aside, the blast<br/>missed.<p>"What?" muttered Kooler dumbly.<br/>Another shot took him in the side and he<br/>grunted in irritated pain. It was little<br/>more than an annoyance. He spun and<br/>found Mihoshi standing there with the<br/>weapon trained on him. "This is insane!"<br/>he snarled as he started firing blast<br/>after blast at her.<p>Mihoshi seemed to always be just out<br/>of reach, and started to fly around him<br/>under her own power. Kooler thought<br/>nothing of it and continued his attack,<br/>becoming more and more frustrated in his<br/>attempts.<p>"Hold still damn you!" he snarled as<br/>he blasted ball after ball of power at<br/>her, they always seemed just out of<br/>reach as she fluttered around.<p>"There's no way she can be this fast<br/>with such a miniscule power level!"<br/>thought Kooler angrily as he continued<br/>his assault.<p>Mihoshi was doing amazingly well<br/>against the creature, but blinked when<br/>she pulled the trigger on her weapon<br/>again. It gave a dry click and she<br/>paused long enough to look at it. "Uh<br/>oh."<p>"What?" said Kooler as he stared at<br/>her for a moment in surprise. "Out of<br/>ammo?" He thought about it for a moment,<br/>it seemed impossible. Especially since<br/>she was using her own ki energy to fire<br/>the blast at him, and not the weapon.<br/>She wasn't nearly out of power yet.<br/>After a moment, he shrugged and charged<br/>another ball of energy to fling at her.<p>Mihoshi continued to dodge, seeming<br/>more and more frightened with each shot.<br/>She fumbled around aimlessly, which only<br/>served to irritate Kooler more.<p>Finally, one of the balls of power<br/>seemed to hit home. It exploded, leaving<br/>nothing more than a slightly cooked<br/>ozone smell in its wake. "Ha! Take that<br/>you irritating little insect!"<p>"Whew! That was close!" said Mihoshi<br/>from directly behind him.<p>"Impossible!" cried Kooler as he<br/>whirled around and stared at her in<br/>shock. "There's no way you're this<br/>fast!"<p>"Fast?" muttered Mihoshi as she<br/>stared at him fearfully.<p>"Take this then!" cried Kooler as he<br/>lunged for her, only to have her vanish<br/>from in front of his fist and appear<br/>behind him. The woman blinked and was<br/>still in the act of flinching.<p>"So, you can teleport can you?" said<br/>Kooler with a small chuckle as he<br/>realized what was happening.<p>"Um? I can? Can I?" said Mihoshi in<br/>genuine confusion.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>On the Mikon Taka Washuu was beating<br/>her head against the wall in<br/>frustration. "Of course! That explains<br/>it! Damn it! How could I be so stupid!"<p>"Um... is something wrong with her?"<br/>asked Usagi.<p>"Just let it be," said Nabiki. She<br/>was with the senshi in the lounge area<br/>of the ship, watching the battle on a<br/>small screen that hung from the ceiling<br/>just above the table. It was being<br/>broadcast by the Juraian news media,<br/>probably taken from satellites in orbit,<br/>giving that all the views were from<br/>above. Apparently they also had the<br/>technology to get speech from orbit as<br/>well. The idea of that made Nabiki<br/>somewhat uncomfortable.<p>"Ready?" asked George as he walked<br/>back with them and frowned. "We're<br/>leaving. We should be in orbit within<br/>the hour."<p>Usagi gave him an unreadable stare<br/>and nodded.<p>"Maybe Mihoshi will die?" said<br/>Washuu as she stopped beating on her<br/>head and thought about that for a<br/>moment. She didn't seem very upset to<br/>anyone else, but it was hard to tell.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks, Tenchi, Hotaru, and Ryoko<br/>all smirked as they walked up to the<br/>door of the room. With an audible click,<br/>they simply looked on as it slowly<br/>opened up for them. "Well, it's time,"<br/>said Trunks as he stepped outside.<p>The others followed after him, and<br/>they found themselves standing alone.<br/>The palace was dead, silence that was<br/>not even broken by a chirping bird.<p>"It's too quiet," commented Ryoko.<p>"Shall we go and see who our<br/>mysterious visitor is after he kills<br/>Mihoshi?" asked Trunks.<p>"No, Trunks," said Hotaru with a<br/>small sigh.<p>"Damn," grumbled the boy as he<br/>kicked a small stone off the edge of the<br/>platform. "Come on then, let's get<br/>going. Don't want to keep them waiting."<p>"Looks like we don't have to worry<br/>about that anyway," said Hotaru as she<br/>stared off into the distance.<p>Tenchi frowned at this, but nodded.<br/>"I feel it too."<p>"Good, we should get going then,"<br/>commented Trunks as he floated into the<br/>sky. The others followed after him.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Mihoshi was in bad shape, Kooler was<br/>fast. It hadn't taken long for him to<br/>start figuring her out once he realized<br/>what was happening. Yosho was lying on<br/>the ground near to Azusa, both of them<br/>were down for the count. She didn't<br/>realize it, but her power was fading<br/>fast.<p>"Trying to run away again?" said<br/>Kooler as he chuckled and caught her<br/>after she avoided another punch. She had<br/>teleported behind him, only to find a<br/>kick waiting for her. With a grunt of<br/>pain, her hair went black and she<br/>slammed into the ground. Tears flowed<br/>from her eyes, and she was beaten pretty<br/>badly now.<p>"You...won't get away...with this,"<br/>she gasped painfully.<p>"Who's going to stop me? You?"<br/>chuckled Kooler as he floated<br/>malevolently above her. "Just die this<br/>time." He started to charge another ball<br/>of power in his hands above his head. "I<br/>think I'll just be rid of the three of<br/>you. You've given me too much trouble to<br/>take any chances!"<p>Once again, an explosion slammed him<br/>out of the attack. This time, it was<br/>large enough to send him flying through<br/>the air and into the ground nearby.<p>Mihoshi's vision blurred for a<br/>moment. She squinted and managed to make<br/>out a ship floating overhead. A familiar<br/>voice floated over to where she was<br/>lying. "Hurry up! That won't keep him<br/>occupied for long! We've got to go!"<p>"George?" she muttered painfully as<br/>she felt hands on her body, helping her<br/>to her feet.<p>"Hurry!" said Usagi as she moved<br/>along side Makoto to carry her onto the<br/>waiting ship. It hadn't even landed, but<br/>merely hovered above the ground with the<br/>ramp down. Azusa and Yosho received the<br/>same treatment, being carried onto the<br/>ship by the Senshi.<p>Once onboard, they door quickly<br/>closed and the ship blasted into the<br/>air.<p>George chuckled to himself as he<br/>flew into the sea of stars above Jurai.<br/>"See, less than an hour." He tapped the<br/>clock on the control panel and smirked<br/>at Usagi.<p>Nabiki heaved a heavy sigh of relief<br/>and slumped down. Her back was against<br/>the wall and she had been sweating<br/>bullets. "I'm surprised that worked."<p>"Those missiles are powerful,"<br/>commented Washuu. "It's why they're<br/>illegal."<p>George glanced back at her and<br/>laughed nervously. "Well, a girl has to<br/>protect herself from pirates right?"<p>"Girl?" said Minako dumbly.<p>"Sorry, I used to be one," muttered<br/>the man as he went red. "You know...last<br/>time."<p>"Oh," said the girl as she pretended<br/>to understand.<p>Washuu rolled her eyes at this, but<br/>said nothing. "We should go now."<p>"What about Trunks and the others?"<br/>asked Usagi.<p>"We can't leave Tenchi behind!"<br/>cried Ayeka fearfully.<p>"Destroy it...the planet is dead<br/>anyway," muttered Azusa. "Maybe we'll<br/>take that bastard with it."<p>Yosho was recovering a little as<br/>well. "There may be nothing else we can<br/>do..." He looked angry and frustrated.<br/>No one could tell if it was because of<br/>his failure, or the destruction of the<br/>planet.<p>"No, we should wait first," said<br/>Washuu.<p>"Who are you to..." started Azusa.<p>The woman's glare silenced any<br/>further protests. She continued<br/>uninterrupted. "Tenchi, Trunks, and<br/>Hotaru are all fine. They just emerged<br/>from the room."<p>"Great! We'll just go back and pick<br/>them up!" said Usagi cheerfully.<p>"I'm afraid that's not possible. We<br/>won't be able to do that again. Kooler<br/>will destroy us before we get the<br/>chance, we only caught him off guard,"<br/>said Washuu.<p>"But, he'll never get to the palace<br/>before us!" cried Ami.<p>"True, but they aren't at the<br/>palace. They just landed right in front<br/>of Kooler's location. They're going to<br/>fight him," said Washuu with a small<br/>sigh. "There's nothing we can do for<br/>them but pray."<p>"No! Tenchi and that monster!"<br/>cried Ayeka right before she passed out<br/>cold.<p>"She took that rather well,"<br/>commented Artemis.<p>Luna promptly thwacked him with her<br/>paw.<p>"What's that?" asked Minako as she<br/>looked at the box in Usagi's lap.<p>"I dunno, it was on the ground where<br/>we found Mihoshi," replied the girl with<br/>a small shrug. She opened it and<br/>blinked. "Hey. This looks like<br/>Okonomiyaki!"<p>"What? That's impossible..." said<br/>Washuu as she walked over and stared<br/>into the box. "Never mind. I forgot who<br/>I was talking about here." She glanced<br/>over at the sleeping woman. Her hair was<br/>still black and she looked rather<br/>peaceful really. "Let's just watch this.<br/>I'm sure none of you want to miss it."<p>With that, everyone's attention<br/>turned to the small screen that hung<br/>from the ceiling.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Kooler growled as he stared at the<br/>sky, briefly considering going after<br/>those who had dared attack him. He<br/>paused though when something caught his<br/>eye. On top of a rather large stone,<br/>looking down on him, was a small boy of<br/>about eight years old.<p>"Ah. You must be Kooler."<p>"Ranma Saotome?" said Kooler as he<br/>smiled and waged his tail in irritation.<p>"My name is Trunks...and you're<br/>about to find out what it's like to<br/>fight a real Super Saiyan, and I don't<br/>mean Ranma." The boy smirked at the<br/>expression the alien gave him.<p>"Somehow, I doubt that," replied<br/>Kooler as he glanced around. He was<br/>surrounded. "Well, this looks<br/>interesting. None of you can match my<br/>power though."<p>Trunks chuckled at this. "You ain't<br/>seen our real power yet."<p>"What the hell is this thing?" said<br/>Ryoko.<p>"I'm not sure," said Hotaru as she<br/>narrowed her eyes at it.<p>"This is it?" asked Tenchi as he<br/>glared at the monster that would do such<br/>a horrible thing.<p>"Yeah, this is Kooler," snorted<br/>Trunks. "Never expected to see your ass<br/>again," he commented at the thing.<p>"That, is not Kooler," replied<br/>Hotaru before the thing answered. "He<br/>was my opponent, and this thing's power<br/>is completely different. I'd say it's<br/>more likely that he's..."<p>The thing gave a small chuckle, and<br/>its skin seemed to liquefy, melting away<br/>until its body was reformed into<br/>something else. "Yes, I am Ekitai." It<br/>spoke as the body reformed into a new<br/>figure. He was skinny, a gangly looking<br/>man with spiky blue hair that went<br/>straight up into the air. It was tied up<br/>by a thick blue bandanna, and his skin<br/>was pale and his eyes a bright,<br/>unnatural looking blue. He chuckled at<br/>them and eyed them all for a moment. His<br/>clothing was nothing but a pair of dark<br/>blue kung-fu pants and a light blue<br/>vest. "Well, I've found what I'm looking<br/>for at any rate. We're going to play a<br/>game, and the prize is this planet."<p>Trunks frowned at this and growled.<br/>"Youma Lord..."<p>"He is strong," commented Hotaru.<p>"You're going down buster!" snarled<br/>Ryoko.<p>Tenchi merely nodded in silent<br/>agreement.<p>"I think we'll just kill you and be<br/>done with it," said Trunks calmly.<p>"Why bother with that?" snorted the<br/>Youma with a small shrug. "This'll be<br/>more fun. You see, I discovered this<br/>wonderful thing you call manga. I've<br/>grown rather obsessed. Saiyans huh?" He<br/>chuckled as he got a dark look in his<br/>eyes. "I've got just the thing for<br/>that." His body liquefied again and<br/>reformed.<p>Trunks gasped at the thing that<br/>stood before him. It laughed insanely<br/>and cocked its head. It had black eyes<br/>and pink skin, its body was muscular and<br/>short. Instead of hair, a pink dorsal<br/>like protrusion flopped lazily behind<br/>its head.<p>"Oh shit," muttered Trunks. "Majin<br/>Buu!" He dropped back into a defensive<br/>stance, and everyone around him noticed<br/>the reaction with a bit of worry. "Get<br/>ready guys, this is going to suck."<p>Buu laughed, whether it was at what<br/>the saiyan boy had said or not; they'd<br/>never know.<p>TBC...<p>You hate me, I know this. Heh. ^_^
