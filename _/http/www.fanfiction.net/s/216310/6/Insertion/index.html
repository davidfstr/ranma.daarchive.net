</div>Insertion<p>Part 5<p>Venus Attacks!<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome was walking home from school. Nothing unusual about<br/>that, accept for the fact that the school day had just begun. They had<br/>just walked away from their rather interesting talk with Tatewaki<br/>Kuno, and had decided to do a bit of exploring.<p>"Where are we?" grumbled Ranma as he glanced around himself.<p>"I dunno," replied Carrot cheerfully.<p>"We're still in Nerima," replied Dan casually.<p>"Oh," said Ranma with a small sigh.<p>"Hey, an arcade," commented Carrot as he looked at a nearby<br/>building.<p>"Wanna go in?" asked Dan.<p>"No," said Ranma flatly.<p>"He's right, we don't have much money on us at the moment," agreed<br/>Carrot. "I'll have to remember it's here though."<p>"You're right, places like this are a good source of information,"<br/>agreed Dan. "We'd do well to remember any bars we pass too."<p>Carrot nodded their head in agreement.<p>"Information?" said Ranma in confusion.<p>"You'd be surprised how useful having some can be," said Dan<br/>casually as they looked around at the crowds of people wandering by<br/>around them.<p>A voice called out behind them, followed by a whistle. "Hey! Stop<br/>right there!"<p>Ranma paused and turned around; a police officer was approaching<br/>them from behind.<p>"Shit," muttered Carrot.<p>"Wasn't expecting this," agreed Dan calmly.<p>"Now what?" cried Ranma nervously.<p>"Relax, let me handle this," said Carrot calmly as the man<br/>approached them.<p>"What are you going to do?" said Ranma nervously.<p>"Relax, we don't need to hurt him. Just a little creative truth<br/>telling," said Carrot with a small chuckle.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Why aren't you in school?" snapped the officer as he grabbed<br/>Ranma by his shoulder.<p>"Huh?" said Ranma innocently as he looked up at the man. "Hello!"<p>"Answer the question!" snapped the officer.<p>"I just returned to Japan a few days ago," said Ranma with a<br/>shrug. "I haven't even been home yet."<p>"What?" said the officer dumbly.<p>"I've just returned from a training trip, in China," said the boy<br/>as he looked at the man for a moment. "I'll be in school tomorrow."<p>"What's your name kid?" snorted the officer.<p>"Ranma Saotome," replied the boy cheerfully.<p>"Come with me," said the man as he looked at the boy for a moment<br/>and frowned. Ranma merely nodded and followed.<p>"Where do you live kid?" said the officer as he turned to face the<br/>boy.<p>"I'm not sure, I haven't been home in ten years," said Ranma with<br/>a small shrug.<p>"Don't get smart with me kid," said the officer.<p>"I'm not being smart. I've been on a voyage of training with my<br/>father for the last ten years," replied the boy with a shrug.<p>"Where is he at?" said the man with his frown deepening.<p>"I'm not sure, I went off to do a bit of exploring. I'll meet him<br/>later today," said Ranma calmly.<p>"Saotome huh?" muttered the officer as he opened the door of his<br/>squad car and pulled out the radio. "What's your mother's name then?"<p>Ranma smirked; this was going better than he had thought. He had<br/>expected the officer to release him after he told his story. "Nodoka."<p>+++++++++++<p>"What's he doing?" said Ranma nervously as they watched the<br/>officer for a moment.<p>"Checking up on us," said Carrot with a small shrug. "It'll only<br/>take a minute."<p>"We shouldn't have lied," said Ranma sternly.<p>"We didn't lie, nothing we told him was a lie," said Carrot<br/>calmly. "We just withheld information from him."<p>"We know where Genma is," commented Dan.<p>"No we don't. We know where he probably is; he and Soun could have<br/>gone out for a drink or something. There's no way to know for sure,"<br/>said Carrot with a small chuckle.<p>++++++++<p>The officer looked at his radio with a frown on his face. The<br/>office had put him through to the Saotome home, and he had expected an<br/>angry mother. Instead, he found a woman frantically asking him strange<br/>questions.<p>"My son is here?" gasped the woman desperately. Hope was clearly<br/>straining her voice.<p>"Yes Ma'am, I've got him standing next to my car right now," said<br/>the officer.<p>"What's he look like? Is he manly?" cried the woman.<p>"Um, I guess so," muttered the officer as he looked up at the boy.<br/>The kid was still standing there, grinning at him like an idiot.<br/>"Look, I'm calling because..."<p>"Ranma? He's finally come home?" said the voice in shock. "Where<br/>are you? Where is he?" cried the frantic woman.<p>"Um...I...Ma'am, he isn't a runaway is he?" muttered the officer<br/>in shock.<p>"His father isn't with him?" said Nodoka with a sudden tensing in<br/>her voice.<p>"Um, no ma'am. Your son said he was meeting with him later..."<br/>stammered the officer. It appeared as though the kid wasn't lying.<p>"Where is he!" cried the woman desperately.<p>"Look, I'll bring him to you. Just give me your address again and<br/>I'll..."<p>"My son is coming home?" said the voice on the other end of the<br/>line.<p>"Yes ma'am, I'll bring him over if you'd like," said the officer<br/>nervously. He heard the sound of something hitting the ground on the<br/>other end of the line, and the line went dead. "Ma'am? Um, hello?" He<br/>turned back towards Ranma. "Get in the car kid."<p>+++++++++++<p>"I've got a mother?" said Ranma as he sat in the back of the car<br/>as they rode towards the Saotome home.<p>"Apparently," muttered Dan lazily.<p>"We've got to let him know about the contract, before he does<br/>something stupid," said Carrot.<p>"Right," grumbled Dan.<p>"What contract? What are you talking about?" said Ranma dumbly.<p>"Well, your father did something really stupid just before you<br/>left," said Carrot sheepishly.<p>"What?" said Ranma with a sudden fear growing in his gut.<p>"Why are you so surprised?" commented Dan.<p>"He's right Ranma," agreed Carrot.<p>"What the hell did that old man do now?" growled Ranma.<p>"Calm down, and we'll tell you. That cop is looking at us funny,"<br/>said Carrot. "It was just before you left on your training trip. Don't<br/>worry, I've got a way out of it for us. We'll seem manlier than ever<br/>before I'm through with her."<p>++++++++++<p>The police officer stood at the door of the Saotome home and<br/>opened it. "Hello? Miss?"<p>"RANMA!" cried a voice from inside, it was quickly followed by the<br/>sound of feet pounding against the floor. Before the officer could<br/>even blink, Nodoka Saotome shot out the door like a bullet, quickly<br/>shoving him aside and taking the boy standing behind him into her<br/>arms.<p>"Gak!" cried Ranma as the woman lifted him off his feet and<br/>crushed him painfully.<p>"My son!" wailed Nodoka.<p>"Huhhhh..." groaned Ranma painfully.<p>The woman put him down and bowed deeply to the officer. "Thank you<br/>sir! You have brought my son home to me!"<p>"Um, it's no problem ma'am," muttered the man as he stood up and<br/>backed away from her. "I'll just let you two alone now. Just make sure<br/>he's in school tomorrow, all right?"<p>Nodoka nodded her head almost violently. "Thank you again!" She<br/>bowed to him deeply once again and he gave a short bow in return<br/>before walking away. Ranma smirked as he noticed the man was shaking<br/>slightly.<p>Nodoka turned towards the boy and smiled. "Is it really you my<br/>son? I'm not dreaming?"<p>"Um, yeah. It's really me mom," said Ranma as he scratched the<br/>back of his head.<p>"Please! Come inside!" she led him into the home and smiled.<p>"Mother?" said Ranma in a hoarse voice quietly as he followed.<p>++++++++++<p>Nodoka was staring at her son in shock for a moment. "You rescued<br/>a young girl from a cursed spring?"<p>"Yeah, it wouldn't be so bad, but there's a catch to it," said<br/>Ranma calmly as he looked at the glass of water she had brought him.<p>"Are you feeling well my son?" said Nodoka as she put her hand<br/>across his forehead.<p>Ranma moved her hand gently away and poured the water over his<br/>head. "You must be Mrs. Saotome! It's nice to meet you! Tee hee!"<br/>Ranma bowed to her mother deeply. "I'm Ranko! Wow! You've got a nice<br/>house! It sure is neat! I like your son! He's so nice, and really<br/>cute! He's got a nice butt...um, I'm sorry. Don't you think his butt<br/>is nice though? I've wanted to meet you for so long! Are you really<br/>Ranma's mother? Wow, that's really nice. I didn't know his mother was<br/>still alive. Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say something like that."<p>Nodoka was simply staring at the overexcited redhead in front of<br/>her. After a moment, her eyes rolled into the back of her head, and<br/>she fell to the ground in a heap.<p>"That went well," commented Ranma as she looked down at the woman<br/>for a moment.<p>Inside their collective head, Ranma Saotome was still screaming<br/>painfully.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Oh, I had the strangest dream," muttered Nodoka as she slowly<br/>woke up. "What would my son think? Having such an odd dream about him.<br/>He looked quite handsome though, I hope he looks as such in reality."<br/>She paused and looked around for a moment. She wasn't in bed, but<br/>rather was laid out on the floor, with a cold rag placed across her<br/>forehead.<p>"Hello Mom," said the boy who was sitting next to her.<p>"It wasn't a dream!" she gasped.<p>"Um, no. Sorry about Ranko, she gets...excited easily," said Ranma<br/>with a slightly nervous twitch on his face.<p>"Hey!" said one of the voices inside his head indignantly.<p>"You mean?" stammered the woman.<p>"Yeah, I'm still cursed," said Ranma sheepishly.<p>"Is there no cure for this horrible curse?" said Nodoka quietly.<p>Ranma's features changed slightly. "Short of killing her, none<br/>that I know of."<p>"So, you must suffer for the sake of this young girl?" said Nodoka<br/>with a small nod. "Manly indeed," she muttered quietly.<p>"Seems like it," agreed Ranma.<p>Nodoka took him into her arms again, squeezing him tightly. "Oh!<br/>My son!"<p>Ranma hugged her back, the two other voices inside his head looked<br/>on silently, and patiently now.<p>"Where is your father? When are you moving back in with me again?<br/>I've missed you so!" said the woman as she finally released him.<p>"Pop is at the Tendo's place, we've been staying with them for a<br/>while," said Ranma calmly.<p>"So, you know of the engagement?" said Nodoka cheerfully.<p>"Um yeah," said Ranma sheepishly.<p>"Look, Mom. Pop doesn't know I'm here," said Ranma as his features<br/>changed slightly again.<p>"Pardon?" said the woman.<p>"Pop is afraid to come back, he thinks that Ranko is a breach of<br/>that contract you made. I don't agree with him, but..."<p>"I see," said Nodoka with a small frown. "You know of that do<br/>you?"<p>Ranma nodded in reply. "I'd like to let him know that we've met.<br/>That moron got cursed too, he turns into a giant panda."<p>"A... Panda?" muttered Nodoka.<p>"Yeah, it's really weird. I think he wants us to stay at the<br/>Tendo's for a while too," said Ranma as he looked away from her for a<br/>moment.<p>"I see...because of the engagement?"<p>Ranma merely nodded. "I'll come visit of course. I know where you<br/>are now."<p>"As shall I," agreed Nodoka as tears welled up in her eyes for a<br/>moment.<p>"Great. I've got to go now," said Ranma as he stood up and walked<br/>over to the door. He paused by the door and turned towards a small<br/>table with a telephone on it. He quickly scratched down a number and<br/>an address. "Here's the number and address to the Tendo's house. Give<br/>me a day or two to let Pop know that we've met. He still thinks you're<br/>going to kill him."<p>Nodoka frowned at this, and nodded her head. "I still might," she<br/>muttered under her breath. "Worthless coward."<p>"I'll come back and see you soon," said Ranma as he walked out the<br/>door.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma was on his way back to the dojo. He had wandered around a<br/>bit after the meeting with his mother. Dan and Carrot were silent for<br/>most of this time, allowing Ranma some time to think.<p>"Well, we're almost back," said Carrot finally as he looked over<br/>at a familiar street sign.<p>"Right," agreed Dan.<p>"You two sure have been quiet," said Ranma.<p>"You've got a lot to think about," said Carrot with a small shrug.<p>Ranma punched himself dead in the face. "Don't ever do that to me<br/>again!"<p>"Ouch! What the?" stammered Carrot.<p>"Hey! That hurt!" growled Dan.<p>"My mother thinks I've got a girl inside me you ass!" snarled<br/>Ranma.<p>"Look, if I hadn't done that, you'd be sitting in her back yard<br/>with a knife on your belly! Don't be so ungrateful!" snapped Carrot as<br/>he punched himself in the gut.<p>"Why couldn't you act like a normal girl?" snapped Ranma as he<br/>pulled at his own hair.<p>"That was more fun! That's why!" snarled Carrot viciously as he<br/>put himself in a headlock and began to shove himself into a telephone<br/>pole.<p>Dan swept his own feet out from underneath him. They all landed<br/>face first on the concrete. "You idiots leave me out of this!"<p>"Not till he apologizes, and promises not to do that again!"<br/>snapped Ranma as he rolled over onto his back, and began to hit the<br/>back of his head against the telephone poll.<p>"Fat chance, Pigtailed Girl!" snarled Carrot as he started to<br/>choke himself.<p>++++++++++<p>On the street, the young boy beating the hell out of himself was<br/>given a wide berth by all the passers by, who merely ignored the scene<br/>otherwise.<p>A little girl pointed down at the boy and shrieked. "Mommy! What's<br/>he doing?"<p>The woman holding her hand turned the girl's head away and said<br/>nothing.<p>The beating abruptly stopped when a voice called out over the<br/>crowd. "Hold villain! At last the hand of justice has found you!"<p>"Huh?" muttered all three voices inside Ranma at one time. They<br/>all looked up and saw a young girl standing on top of a wall. She was<br/>wearing a sailor fuku, and had a strange looking mask over her face.<br/>The girl's long blonde hair billowed in the wind dramatically, and she<br/>jabbed a finger at them.<p>"The defender of love and justice has found you at last demon!<br/>Prepare to be punished by Sailor V!"<p>"Hey, it's the senshi of Venus," commented Ranma dumbly from the<br/>ground as he looked at the girl in shock for a moment.<p>A small white cat that was standing at the girl's feet gasped in<br/>shock, and quickly jumped down to the ground in front of them.<p>"Cat..." stammered Ranma.<p>"You know more than I expected," said Venus as she narrowed her<br/>eyes at him. "You really are one of the enemy, aren't you?"<p>"Huh? Enemy?" said the boy dumbly, his gaze was still locked<br/>fearfully on the feline that was standing in front of him.<p>"Destroy it quickly V! This thing is dangerous!" said Artemis.<p>"Talking cat..." muttered Ranma fearfully. He then blinked and<br/>looked up at Venus. "Destroy?"<p>"Take this!" screamed the girl as she jumped down and kicked him<br/>dead in the face.<p>Ranma skid across the pavement, and landed headfirst in a wall.<br/>"Ouch! Why that dirty little..." He shook his head and saw Venus<br/>standing over him, her face was an angry looking scowl. He paused and<br/>snorted for a moment, staring at her legs from his prone position on<br/>the ground. "Wow. Those go all the way up."<p>Venus blinked and looked down at where he was staring. "Pervert!"<br/>She kicked him again, pushing him into the wall harder, and creating a<br/>crater.<p>Ranma grunted in pain and slumped forward for a moment. "If you<br/>hadn't been standing right in front of me, I wouldn't have been<br/>looking there!"<p>"Venus! You have to destroy it!" cried Artemis from just behind<br/>her.<p>The only voice that had been silent thus far in the battle,<br/>suddenly made a sound. "Niyau!"<p>"What?" gasped the senshi as she looked at the strange position<br/>the boy had taken up. He was sitting on his hind legs, with one hand<br/>on the ground, and the other curled up in a cat-like paw beside his<br/>face.<p>"Heh, you've unlocked the Nekoken," said Ranma with a dangerous<br/>and feral looking gleam in his eyes. He bolted into the air, easily<br/>clearing Venus's head and landed just behind her.<p>"All right, come on!" snarled Ranma as he stepped back slightly.<p>"What?" muttered Venus as the boy waved his hand. She was suddenly<br/>thrown back into the wall. Hundreds of sharp blows slammed into her<br/>body as she created a crater of her own.<p>"Such power!" commented Armetis in horror.<p>The blonde girl looked down at her fuku, several tears had<br/>appeared inside the fabric, and her skirt was in tatters. She growled<br/>angrily and glared at the boy for a moment, he was still sitting<br/>quietly opposite her. An occasional catlike growl escaped his lips as<br/>he gazed at her calmly. Despite his calmness, something feral burned<br/>in the back of his eyes.<p>"Looks like I'm gonna have to go all out," muttered Venus.<p>"Come on Minako, calm down. I don't want to fight you, you're<br/>kinda cute," said Ranma with a slight chuckle.<p>"He knows?" gasped Artemis in shock.<p>"No way!" said Venus as she stepped back for a moment.<p>"Let's play nice," said Ranma as he seemed to force himself to<br/>stand up.<p>Venus narrowed her eyes at him. "Monster."<p>"Hey! I am not a monster," snapped the boy irritably.<p>"Take this! Venus Crescent Beam!" snarled the girl as she lashed<br/>out at him with her attack. The arc of energy rushed towards Ranma far<br/>to fast for him to dodge.<p>The boy slashed upwards with his hand, but the Nekoken did nothing<br/>to the blast, and he was caught in the chest and thrown back, clear<br/>across the street. He slammed into a nearby clothing store window, and<br/>blew through the glass, landing painfully on the floor in a shower of<br/>debris. A few racks of clothing fell on top of him and customers<br/>scattered like roaches away from the scene.<p>Venus was also thrown into the wall again, the Nekoken had not<br/>stopped her attack, but hers hadn't stopped it either. She landed<br/>inside the crater from her first impact, and the wall cracked even<br/>more.<p>"Hurry up Sailor V!" cried Artemis as he scurried towards the<br/>shattered window.<p>"Easy for you to say," muttered the girl as she staggered to her<br/>feet again. She jogged over and peered inside, Ranma was gone.<p>No one noticed the figure wearing a black fedora, sunglasses, and a<br/>long black trench coat walk out of the restroom and out into the<br/>street. A familiar looking red pigtail flopped about just over the<br/>coat's collar as she walked away.<p>A few frightened onlookers pointed Venus towards the bathroom. She<br/>rushed inside, and found an open window. "Damn!" she screamed as she<br/>climbed through it. Artemis met her in the alleyway behind the store.<p>"He's gone! Vanished!" cried the cat.<p>+++++++++<p>Carrot frowned deeply. Ranma was awake again, thanks to the cold<br/>water. "I guess Cat's really don't like getting wet, eh Ranma?"<p>"Shut up," said Ranma in retort.<p>"That was not good. The two of us were barely able to stay in<br/>control," muttered Dan angrily. "Sailor Venus could be a problem. Why<br/>does she think we're a demon?"<p>"I don't know, but we've got to think of a way to change her<br/>mind," said Carrot coolly.<p>"I say we just get rid of her, this could quickly become annoying,<br/>especially if the other senshi join in it with her," said Dan with a<br/>slight growl.<p>"Hey! I ain't killin nobody!" snapped Ranma defensively.<p>"I'm afraid Ranma's right, Dan. We can't kill her," said Carrot<br/>firmly.<p>"You two are pansies," snorted Dan irritably.<p>"I for one don't want to go toe to toe against Beryl and her<br/>minions," said Carrot firmly. "Especially not alone, which is what<br/>will happen if we kill the senshi. To say nothing of the stuff that<br/>comes after Beryl."<p>"What's a Beryl?" muttered Ranma in confusion.<p>"Big, mean, and very powerful. Not something we want to fight<br/>Ranma, if we can help it that is."<p>"We've got to defend ourselves though," said Dan firmly. "I<br/>promise we won't kill her."<p>"Oh, I get it," said Carrot with a small smirk. "You want to bring<br/>them out again."<p>Dan nodded, a predatory grin appearing on his face. "Captain<br/>Destructo returns again."<p>"Who?" said Ranma in confusion. "You never did explain why we<br/>called ourselves that before."<p>"That was what they called me when I was working for the Denver<br/>Police Department," said Dan with a small chuckle. "Things had this<br/>weird tendency to explode around me."<p>"Sounds like one of those cheesy nineteen thirties sci-fi serial<br/>shows," commented Carrot.<p>"That's right, the guy who started calling me that was a fan of<br/>those things. It sort of just stuck."<p>"Well, we'll need to be careful from now on then," said Carrot<br/>firmly. "Don't forget, no matter what, we can't kill the senshi. Our<br/>objective is to convince her we aren't a youma, which has happened<br/>somehow."<p>"Right," agreed Dan with a smirk forming on his face. If Ranma<br/>could see the look he had at that moment, he definitely wouldn't have<br/>liked it one bit.<p>++++++++++<p>An hour later, Ranma was sitting in his father in his room.<p>"You what?" said Genma in shock.<p>"Mom found me!" cried Ranma desperately. The look of complete fear<br/>was quite convincing. "I couldn't get away...she saw...EVERYTHING!"<p>"Do you have any idea what you've done boy!" cried Genma in<br/>terror.<p>"We're doomed Pop!" cried the pigtailed boy desperately.<p>"Come on! We're getting out of here!" said Genma as he stood up<br/>and grabbed his traveling pack.<p>"No!" said Ranma dramatically.<p>"What?" said Genma with fear in his eyes.<p>"I shall face my fate...as a man!" said Ranma firmly. A look of<br/>determination burned in his eyes.<p>"Son! Don't talk crazy! We can still be cured! It's not too late!"<br/>cried Genma desperately.<p>"No, I will not run away from my destiny old man," said Ranma with<br/>righteous tears in his eyes. "You can run if you want. I will not be a<br/>coward! I shall die with honor!"<p>"Boy! Are you out of your mind!" cried Genma as he took his son<br/>by his collar.<p>"No, I am not," said Ranma firmly as he pushed the man's hands<br/>away and walked out of the room.<p>Genma stood and stared at the doorway, completely numb with<br/>terror. He could barely move, and his legs felt like they were made of<br/>jelly. "What have you done boy?" He fell down and sobbed into his<br/>hands.<p>+++++++++++<p>Nabiki raised her eyebrow as Ranma's firm looking face changed to<br/>a cheerful smile the instant he walked out of his room. He strolled by<br/>her, whistling a tune to himself with his hands in his pockets as he<br/>walked down the stairs. He turned and spared her a small wink as he<br/>passed and chuckled to himself.<p>"What was that about?" she wondered out loud.<p>++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Captain Destructo?<p>
