</div>Insertion<p>Part 15<p>New things...<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma sat in front of a small computer screen in his room. It was<br/>a laptop, and looked relatively normal. The display gave away<br/>something more though, it was showing some very advanced plans to some<br/>kind of electronic device.<p>"You mean, I can make one?" said Ranma in shock as he stared at it<br/>in awe.<p>"Yes," replied the computer with some onscreen text. It had a<br/>voice option, but Ranma had turned it off to prevent others from<br/>overhearing.<p>"Oh man, this is so cool! Can you, I dunno, put out some<br/>simplified instructions?" he said as he leaned forward and smirked.<br/>After a moment, his face fell. "Oh boy. This is simplified?"<p>++++++++++<p>Akane sat up from where she was lying with a manga in her hands.<br/>She blinked and looked down at the watch Ranma had given her in<br/>surprise as it gave a small beep. "The Alarm?" she wondered out loud<br/>as she pushed the button he had told her too when it happened.<p>"Hey! Akane," said Ranma's voice.<p>She jumped in surprise. "What the?" she gasped in shock.<p>"What? You sound surprised," said the boy with a small chuckle.<p>"I thought you were kidding!" said the girl in shock.<p>"Yeah, well now you know better," replied the boy in an amused<br/>tone.<p>"Right..." she muttered to herself. She wondered how much of the<br/>rest of what he had told her was more than a joke. Surely the whole<br/>mess about having to maybe fight off monsters and senshi was. After<br/>all, those were just tabloid stories...right?<p>"Anyway, I'm goin over to see the guys. I got some stuff I want to<br/>go over with them," said the boy casually.<p>"Should I come?" she asked nervously. The men were far from ugly,<br/>but also made her slightly nervous for some reason she couldn't<br/>explain.<p>"If you want, but this is technical stuff. I don't really want to<br/>go myself, it's gonna be pretty boring," he said with a small sigh.<br/>"Just wanted to test out the watch, and let you know I was going."<p>"Right, I'll stay here then," said the girl with a small sigh.<p>"Okay, back later."<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"You want me to make some of these?" said Nephrite with a smirk on<br/>his face.<p>"You're the techno geek," said Ranma with a shrug.<p>The man frowned at this and simply sat down. "I hate it when you<br/>call me that, but I am rather bored."<p>"How long?" asked Ranma with a smirk on his face.<p>"With the equipment we stole? Probably about an hour for one,"<br/>replied the man with a small shrug of his shoulders.<p>"Great. I want to have a couple for myself and Akane tonight<br/>then," said the boy cheerfully. "You can make em for the others<br/>whenever you feel like it, but we're going to need them."<p>"Oh? What exactly is it?" said Nephrite as he peered at the screen<br/>for a moment.<p>"Memory erasers," said Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"I've never heard of anything like that," replied the man with a<br/>frown.<p>"I asked the computer a few questions," replied Ranma with a small<br/>shrug. "Is this possible? How could I do it if it is? Can I make it<br/>compact, say the size of a pen? You get the idea."<p>"Right," commented Nephrite as he tapped a few keys on his own<br/>keyboard. "I take it these are for adjusting the length of the memory<br/>you want to erase?" He pointed out several dials along the length of<br/>the pen like object.<p>"Basically," said the boy with a small shrug. "I'm more worried<br/>about parts than anything else," said Ranma with a small frown.<p>"There's actually nothing too advanced in these things, not by<br/>Mercury standards anyway," replied Nephrite with a small shrug. "It's<br/>probably just a case of the need for things like this never coming<br/>up."<p>"What's with these two piles?" asked Ranma as he noticed that the<br/>large dump of equipment was now arranged in two separate areas. They<br/>had managed to swipe more than two hundred different objects.<p>"One side is for equipment of kinds," said Nephrite as he pointed<br/>at the larger pile. "This is weapons."<p>"Cool," said Ranma cheerfully. He lifted a couple of gun shaped<br/>objects in his hands and hefted them. "What are these again?" He<br/>fumbled for the memory for a moment and frowned.<p>"Plasma guns," replied Nephrite calmly.<p>"They don't feel like metal," commented the boy with a frown.<p>"They aren't, they were designed to avoid detection. There's<br/>nothing in this time that can spot them as far as I know," said the<br/>man with a small shrug.<p>"Great, I'll take these then," said Ranma as he put them into his<br/>belt and covered them with his shirt.<p>"Good," said Nephrite with a small nod as he began to set up his<br/>tools.<p>"Say...this isn't what I think it is...is it?" muttered Ranma as he<br/>eyed four long round objects that were lined up together. He lifted<br/>one up in his hand, and pushed a button on the side. It emitted a<br/>small snap and a blade of light burst from the top. "No way."<p>"Like that do you?" said Nephrite with a small chuckle.<p>Ranma turned it off and put it back down, noticing a particularly<br/>long one. "Heh. This one is better. It'll fit in with my new way of<br/>fighting better." There was a double snapping sound as the blades on<br/>either end came to life, creating a bladed staff of light.<p>"Oh yes, the martial arts thing," said Nephrite coolly as he<br/>started to work.<p>"Yup," commented Ranma as he picked up a few clips and hooked them<br/>onto his belt. "Where are the others?"<p>"The bar down the street," said Nephrite. "I was there, but it's<br/>pretty boring tonight."<p>"Right," said Ranma cheerfully. "I know you don't want me around<br/>while you're working, so I'll go hang out for a few hours then."<p>"When I'm done, I'll leave them on the table for you. I'm getting<br/>kind of tired actually. I'm interested enough to stay up and see how<br/>this comes out though." Nephrite chuckled a bit and hunched over to<br/>really begin.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma was walking home cheerfully, his hands in his pockets as he<br/>strolled down the street. His sunglasses were rather unusual looking<br/>for as late as it was getting.<p>"Aiya! Destructo!" cried a familiar voice. "Shampoo find you at<br/>last!" The Amazon rushed up to grab the boy, and he turned to face her<br/>with a smirk on his face.<p>"Hey, look at this for a second would you?" he asked calmly as he<br/>held up what appeared to be a large silver pen. It flipped up and she<br/>noticed a small red set of crystals on the top half.<p>The girl paused in mid glomp and blinked. "What is talking?"<p>There was a flash of red light, and the pigtailed boy waved his<br/>hand in front of her face for a moment before smiling. "Heh. You<br/>passed a guy on the street who kind of looked like me, it wasn't<br/>really me though, and you just went back to what you were doing." He<br/>turned away and started walking again, leaving her standing there<br/>dumbly.<p>Shampoo blinked and seemed to jump awake suddenly. "Aiya. Almost<br/>thought was Airen..." she muttered as she continued on her way.<p>Ranma chuckled to himself as he heard her. The rather unpleasant<br/>gleam in his eyes was hidden away by his shades.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"A what?" muttered Akane in shock.<p>"A memory eraser. Look, it works like this." The boy pulled his<br/>own out and opened her door, causing Nabiki too fall into the room<br/>with a glass in her hand.<p>"I um...was thirsty..." muttered the girl.<p>"Sunglasses," said Ranma calmly.<p>Akane put hers on, and looked at him for a moment in confusion.<p>Ranma flashed the light in Nabiki's face causing her to go blank.<p>"Nabiki, you just overheard us talking about...losing our<br/>virginity to each other, without any strings attached."<p>"What!" cried Akane angrily.<p>"Akane! Don't you dare! I mean...um...I was just passing by...and<br/>I heard...you wouldn't would you?" gasped the girl as she clutched her<br/>sister's shoulders.<p>The girl simply stared at her in horror.<p>Ranma was behind her back, pointing at his memory eraser with a<br/>grin on his face.<p>The young girl nodded, and pointed it at her sister. Another flash<br/>of light later the girl was standing dumbly in front of her.<p>"You didn't hear anything interesting at all, and fell through the<br/>door when you tried to stand up and tripped," said Akane with a dark<br/>frown on her face. She turned her head towards Ranma and stuck her<br/>tongue out at him. "Pervert!"<p>"Hiya Nabiki, any in particular reason you came in here?" said the<br/>boy cheerfully as he turned to look at the girl.<p>She had a huge blush on her face and turned away. "I just tripped,<br/>that's all. Sorry." She shuffled away and left them alone.<p>"Where did you get this?" said the girl as she stared at the<br/>strange object in awe.<p>"It's actually called a Neuralizer. Nephrite made it for me, he's<br/>good at stuff like that," replied the boy with a shrug.<p>"Oh," said the girl as she sat down on her bed. "So, what time do<br/>we leave?"<p>"About two hours," said Ranma cheerfully. "The party only lasts<br/>about two hours, it's some private invitation thing. We should be just<br/>for show this time. Museum security will take over after it's over."<p>"Oh, okay," said the girl with a small shrug. "I'll be ready<br/>then."<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"This is it?" muttered Akane as she stared at the mask for a<br/>moment. It was in the lobby of the museum, and was encased in glass on<br/>a pedestal.<p>"Yeah," muttered Ranma uncomfortably.<p>"Something wrong?" asked the girl as she turned to face him.<p>"It's nothing, I've just seen something like this before. It was<br/>bad news," replied the boy calmly.<p>"What? Is it cursed or something?" asked the girl with a small<br/>snort.<p>Ranma merely nodded silently as he peered at it. It was simple<br/>enough, a flat face made out of wood, with a strip of metal running<br/>from the forehead to the tip of the nose.<p>"Don't tell me you believe in stuff like that," said the girl with<br/>a small chuckle.<p>"Go get me a glass of water, and I'll show you," said Ranma<br/>calmly.<p>Akane blinked and turned to look at the thing for a moment. "I<br/>never thought of it that way."<p>"Well, nothing should happen we can't handle during the party. You<br/>kind of have to wear it for it to do anything to you as I recall."<p>The pair turned towards the doors as they were opened and guests<br/>started to enter. They took their positions and prepared for a long<br/>boring stay.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"I don't believe it!" said Carrot excitedly. "This is so cool!"<p>"What? It's just some stupid mask," grumbled Ranma.<p>"What's the big deal?" grumbled Dan.<p>"It's the Mask. The Mask."<p>"So?" snorted Ranma.<p>"You don't understand, this thing is really cursed. It turns<br/>people into a sort of invincible demon thing, but it isn't really<br/>evil. It bases what it does to you on your deepest desires. Some<br/>people would become a superhero, others would become a sort of<br/>monster. It's pretty cool, but I don't think it would be good to have<br/>it running around."<p>"I think you've read too many comics," snorted Dan irritably.<p>"I think it's kind of pretty," said Pissant.<p>"That cruddy old thing?" snorted Dan.<p>"Well, in an oldish kinda way," said the voice sheepishly.<p>"I wonder what it would do to us?" said Ranma.<p>"We'd probably short it out or something, there's too many of us,"<br/>said Carrot with a small chuckle.<p>"Anyway, things are looking good so far," said Dan as he peered at<br/>the crowd. "Not near as many as that diamond."<p>"Well, who want's to play charades?" asked Carrot.<p>"You dope, we can't see each other!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Twenty questions?" offered Pissant.<p>"How about the quiet game?" said Dan irritably.<p>"Hey! That sounds fun!" cheered Pissant.<p>"What the heck is that?" muttered Ranma.<p>"We see who can shut up for the longest. First one to talk loses,"<br/>said Dan.<p>Carrot said nothing, and resisted the urge to hang their head in<br/>shame as Ranma and Pissant instantly agreed to the game.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma and Akane walked out of the museum, the job completed.<p>"Well, that's that," said the girl with as she walked down to the<br/>taxi waiting for them below.<p>"Somehow, I doubt it," said Ranma with a frown on his face. He<br/>looked back at the doors and started after her.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"Ranma! How dare you take my little girl on such a dangerous job!"<br/>cried Soun angrily as he appeared in front of the boy.<p>Ranma frowned and picked up the man's keys from a small table by<br/>the door. He reached over and put them into his pocket.<p>"What are you doing son?" snapped Soun angrily.<p>The boy then raised his neuralizer and flashed the man in his<br/>face. "You were looking for your keys to go somewhere, but can't find<br/>them."<p>"Are you sure that's okay?" said Akane as she stepped by her<br/>father.<p>"Relax," said Ranma as he strolled up to his room.<p>After a moment, Soun was moving through the home, muttering about<br/>not being able to find something.<p>"Daddy? What are you doing?" said Nabiki as she walked down the<br/>stairs to find him rummaging through a pile of magazines.<p>"Looking for my keys, I can't find them," said the man irritably.<p>"What do you need them for?" she said as she arched her eyebrow<br/>slightly.<p>"I was going to go somewhere...but..."<p>"Go somewhere?" she said as she looked up at the clock. It was<br/>after midnight.<p>"If only I could remember where I was going!" said Soun angrily as<br/>he continued his search.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>"Stop right there!" cried one of the security guards. The dark<br/>clad figure was standing over the broken remains of the glass case<br/>used to house the mask. It was firmly in his grip, and he spun around.<p>"Shit! I didn't expect them to be so fast!" grumbled the man as he<br/>rushed towards the front doors. They were locked, but also made of<br/>glass. He burst into the street and started running. Unfortunately, he<br/>never saw the truck that was speeding down the road. "Huh?" It was all<br/>he managed to get out before it slammed into him.<p>The mask sailed from his dead hand, and into a nearby drainage<br/>ditch. It floated away, bobbing up and down in the water as it went.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>"He's been like this all night?" muttered Akane as she stared at<br/>her father in shock. Soun was scouring the floor under the table, in<br/>search of his elusive keys. His eyes were bloodshot, and tears were<br/>running down his face. The entire living room was destroyed by his mad<br/>search.<p>Ranma stood just behind her. "I never thought he'd take it this<br/>far," he grumbled irritably.<p>"This is your fault!" snapped the girl as she spun around to face<br/>him.<p>"Calm down! I'm sorry!" he said with a small frown. "Look, it's<br/>not like he's got a job to go to, or classes to teach. He can go to<br/>sleep anytime he needs too. I didn't mean for this too happen, but<br/>getting mad about it won't fix anything. We'll just have to be more<br/>careful in the future."<p>Akane stomped away from him and he sighed. "Great."<p>Soun sat down at the table, running his hands through his hair in<br/>frustration.<p>"Um, hi," said Ranma as he sat down next to him. Kasumi was<br/>setting out breakfast, and Nabiki was simply staring at her father in<br/>fascination.<p>"Good morning Ranma. Tell me, have you seen my keys?"<p>"They aren't in the dojo either, Tendo," said Genma as he walked<br/>back into the room and frowned. "I've got no idea where they might<br/>be."<p>Ranma began to sweat nervously as Akane gave him an angry glare.<br/>"Um? Mr. Tendo? Did you check your pocket? I do that sometimes with<br/>stuff."<p>Soun blinked at him and then frowned. "What are you saying? I'm<br/>not that absent..." He reached into his pocket and came up with the<br/>missing keys.<p>Everyone stared at him for a moment, and he hung his head for a<br/>moment, and then lifted his head into the air and screamed before he<br/>passed out.<p>"He took that rather well," said Kasumi sweetly.<p>Ranma was looking rather uncomfortable under Akane's harsh glare.<br/>"Sorry," he muttered again.<p>"Don't be, he'd have kept looking for those keys for days. This<br/>isn't the first time this has happened," commented Nabiki as she<br/>started to eat.<p>Everyone looked at her, the three Tendo sisters looked rather<br/>embarrassed. Ranma and Genma merely looked confused.<p>"I guess it wasn't as bad as I'd thought," said Ranma with a shrug<br/>as he started to eat as well.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>"Give us your lunch money punk!" screamed one of the trio of<br/>masked boys standing around Hikaru Gosunkugi.<p>"But, then I won't be able to buy lunch!" whined the boy<br/>pathetically.<p>"So you're hungry are you?" said one of the masked boys<br/>arrogantly.<p>"Well, not at the moment," said Hikaru as he scratched the back of<br/>his head nervously.<p>"Well then, you can eat my shoe!" cried another one of the boys as<br/>he kicked the rather pathetic boy in his gut.<p>"No! Don't hit me again! You can have it! I probably won't get<br/>hungry anyway!"<p>"Too late for that! I think you need a drink to go with that!"<br/>snapped the lead gang member.<p>"Huh?" muttered Hikaru dumbly as he found himself lifted into the<br/>air by the trio. They tossed him over the fence, and into the drainage<br/>ditch, laughing crudely as he floundered about in the water.<p>Hikaru stumbled back to his feet, finding himself knee deep in<br/>water. He clenched his fists and cried. He tried to stop, but it was<br/>just too much. He smirked a bit as he looked down at his school bag.<br/>"At least I've still got my lunch money." He paused as something<br/>struck him on the leg. A quick glance down revealed a small wooden<br/>mask. It was floating against his leg, staying in place as the water<br/>flowed on behind him. "What the?" He lifted it up and shook some of<br/>the water off, peering at it in confusion. "What's this? Some old<br/>mask?"<p>He was about to toss it over his shoulder, when something stopped him.<br/>Not certain why, he put the mask into his bag, and started to climb<br/>out of the ditch.<p>++++++++++<p>A short time later, a bit further down the road.<p>"Hey little girl, goin to school?"<p>"Y-yes..."<p>"Did daddy give you any lunch money?"<p>"A little...why?"<p>"I think you should give it to us."<p>"But..."<p>"Come on, be a good little girl and give us you're money."<p>"What the heck is she doin?"<p>"Look kid. You'd better give it up, or else my friends and I are<br/>gonna have to get mean. We're nice guy's see..." The mask wearing<br/>bully made the mistake of grabbing Hotaru by her collar.<p>"Let go," she said quietly as she put her arm between his and<br/>snagged his wrist. With a simple twist, he was pulled down to the<br/>ground and held firmly in place.<p>"Haw! Getting beat up by a little shrimp!" cried another of the<br/>bullies. He poked at her with his finger.<p>Hotaru wasted no time, she released her first victim and snagged<br/>him before he could react, pulling down with her hand, and tapping his<br/>wrist, dislocating the finger.<p>"Ouch! You little shit!" screamed the boy angrily.<p>"Get her you idiots!" snapped the lead gang member.<p>The trio rushed forward on full assault.<p>Hotaru merely stepped back, her hand flew out and she snagged one<br/>of the outstretched punches, redirecting the momentum so that it<br/>slammed into one of his friends.<p>"Little..." That was as far as he got. Hotaru snagged his wrist<br/>and spun around fluidly, twisting her own weight and flipping him over<br/>almost casually. There was a snapping sound as the boy's wrist broke,<br/>causing him to scream in pain.<p>The first boy was back on his feet, he pulled a knife out and<br/>glared at her. "Now I'm gonna have to cut ya ta teach ya a lesson!"<p>Hotaru narrowed her eyes as he dove for her. She shifted back,<br/>extending her leg out into his solar plexus, and grabbed his arm. In a<br/>single fluid motion, she cause him to stab his own leg and rolled<br/>under him as he fell.<p>The trio was lying on the ground, groaning in pain as she strolled<br/>away towards her school calmly. Her face was a mask of complete ice as<br/>she left them there. After a moment, she seemed to snap out of it and<br/>gasped for breath.<p>"Saotome-sensei was right. I'm going to have to work harder, I'm<br/>really tired," she moved over to a small set of stairs on an apartment<br/>building and sat down for a moment to catch her breath.<p>++++++++++++<p>On a distant world, far away from the Earth...<p>"Where the hell am I?" snarled Ryoga as he continued to walk<br/>through the wilderness.<p>A hissing noise caught his attention, and he turned to glare at<br/>the things that were following him.<p>"Don't you ever give up?" he snarled.<p>The things hissed at him, there were about a dozen of them. They<br/>were eight feet tall, with black skin and no eyes. One of them opened<br/>its jaws, revealing another set inside that slid outward<br/>threateningly.<p>Ryoga snorted and put up his fists. "I don't have all day you<br/>know."<p>The things charged him in a swarm, and he screamed in rage as he<br/>met them.<p>A moment later, a loud chorus of screeching noises sounded, and<br/>the things scurried away in terror. Ryoga was standing unharmed and<br/>glaring at them as they ran.<p>"Don't come back this time!" he called after them as he shook his<br/>fist in the air. "Stupid things, like giant ants or something." He<br/>continued on his way, trying to find his way into Nerima once again.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Senshi vs. MIB?<p>
