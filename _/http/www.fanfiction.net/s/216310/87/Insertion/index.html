</div>Insertion<p>Part 87<p>Victory on Jurai.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Trunks smirked as he walked slowly across the paved surface of the<br/>Jurai spaceport's landing area. Starships roared as they landed around<br/>the group as they casually strolled through the midst of the massive<br/>gusts of wind that the engines kicked up. The palace was nearby,<br/>rising over the horizon a short distance away, eating up much of the<br/>view of the planet's surface. A forest of giant trees surrounded the<br/>airfield, dwarfed by the giant tree that housed the Juraian Royal<br/>Family.<p>"I hate this sort of thing," commented Trunks as he snorted in<br/>undisguised annoyance.<p>"Huh?" said Tenchi as he looked at the boy at his side in<br/>confusion.<p>"Hey!" said Ryoko as she waved to the large crowd forming on the<br/>other side of the field. Thousands of Juraians had gathered on the<br/>opposite side of the airfield.<p>Hotaru frowned slightly. "What is this?"<p>"A welcome for the heroes," said Trunks with a small frown.<p>"Heroes?" muttered Tenchi dumbly.<p>"Well, we did just save the planet," said Ryoko as she grabbed him<br/>around his neck.<p>"Cut it out Ryoko! Not in front of all these people!" cried the<br/>boy in embarrassment.<p>"Come on, the others should be getting back soon, if they aren't<br/>there already," said Trunks as he started moving forward a little<br/>faster.<p>"We could just fly there," said Hotaru as she smirked at him.<p>"Bah, I bet he loves this stuff really," said Ryoko as she smirked<br/>at the girl for a moment.<p>"Man, there's so many of them," said Tenchi nervously.<p>As they entered the crowd a wave of cheers sounded all around<br/>them, the crowd seemed to swarm around them. They continued moving as<br/>if they weren't there, ignoring the cries of joy around them.<p>A media crew pushed through the crowd and Trunks paused for a<br/>moment. The others looked at him in confusion. It was a blonde woman<br/>in a professional looking spandex outfit. Trunks wasn't sure why it<br/>looked professional, but it did. There was a cameraman with her, with<br/>his face hidden behind the lenses of whatever passed for video media<br/>on Jurai.<p>"We are here live with the heroes who have single handedly saved<br/>the entire planet from destruction at the hands of the evil monster!"<p>"Who are you?" said the little boy as he peered at her for a<br/>moment.<p>"Not now kid," said the woman as she glanced down at the boy.<p>Trunks blinked at this. "Huh?"<p>"Can we see them yet?" asked the woman as she looked at her<br/>cameraman.<p>"Hey," said Trunks as he poked her with his finger.<p>The woman was thrown down on the ground hard, almost taking<br/>several members of the crowd with her.<p>"Oops," said the boy as he looked at his finger in confusion.<br/>"Guess I don't know my own strength, sorry lady."<p>The crowd backed away from him slightly.<p>"Hey! Careful!" said Tenchi.<p>"It's them!" cried the woman as she jumped to her feet.<p>"Um, yeah," said Ryoko lamely.<p>"The mystery saviors of Jurai at last!" said the woman a little<br/>too dramatically.<p>Trunks frowned at this. "Mystery? You mean, you haven't heard of<br/>us?"<p>"Um...no," said the woman as she stared at him.<p>"I'm the great martial arts master Trunks, Prince of the Sayajin,<br/>this is Crowned Prince Tenchi Masaki, visiting from Earth. He's the<br/>son of First Prince of Jurai Yosho in case you didn't know. This is<br/>Hotaru, or Sailor Saturn, Senshi of Death and Rebirth, reborn from the<br/>Silver Millenium. She's supposed to bring about the end of some world<br/>or something according to prophecy, but I think it's another planet.<br/>You probably don't have to worry. Oh, and this is Space Pirate Ryoko,<br/>bane of Jurai, scourge of the Universe, and all around nasty person.<br/>She got better though."<p>"Heh heh," said Ryoko as she stared at the boy for a moment.<p>The crowd was staring at him dumbly; a dead silence filled the<br/>air.<p>"What?" said the boy.<p>The woman was merely standing there with her jaw hanging open as<br/>she stared at him. She turned towards her cameraman and spoke to him.<br/>"Are we sure these are the right people?"<p>The man looked at her and shrugged.<p>Trunks frowned at her and crossed his arms. "Excuse me, but I've<br/>got to get to the palace, the Emperor is probably expecting us."<p>Tenchi thought he was going to die of embarrassment.<p>Hotaru was trying not to giggle and look intimidating.<p>Ryoko was standing in the middle of a large crowd of Juraians,<br/>hoping they wouldn't riot now that her identity was revealed. She had<br/>made quite a mess last time she was on the planet.<p>"Come on you losers, I'm tired of this," said Trunks as he floated<br/>into the air.<p>The others flew after him, leaving the crowd behind.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Washuu smirked as she walked off the ramp of the starship and<br/>glanced around. "Well, it seems we're not the first ones back."<p>An envoy of Juraians was waiting for the Emperor to emerge. Ami<br/>and Minako helped him down the ramp, by holding his arms over their<br/>shoulders. Yosho walked down the ramp under his own power, if not a<br/>little slowly. Mihoshi stumbled out a little dumbly, her hair still<br/>black and a somewhat dazed stare; more than normal that is. The rest<br/>of the senshi quickly followed, with Nabiki behind them.<p>"Bah," grumbled George as he peeked out of the ship for a moment.<br/>He turned back inside and ignored the scene outside for the moment.<p>"For god's sake! Someone get him some men's clothes!" said Nabiki<br/>as she glared at some of the guards kneeling before the group.<p>They looked up at her in confusion for a moment.<p>"You heard the girl," grumbled Azusa as he shifted onto the arms<br/>of a pair of high-ranking officers. "Take me to my room."<p>Yosho glanced at Nabiki for a moment and frowned.<p>"You noticed too?" asked the woman as she smirked at him for a<br/>moment.<p>"Eh?" said the man as he glanced at her.<p>"During the battle, she called him 'Ranma'."<p>"Yes..." said the man as his frown deepened somewhat. "I do not<br/>believe anyone else noticed it."<p>"That could be problematic," said Washuu.<p>"Yes, if she were to reveal it..."<p>"He would lose some of their trust, that's not a good idea at this<br/>point," said the redhead as she glanced at the girl for a moment.<br/>"I'll have to speak with him about this later."<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Inside the office of the Men in Black, a meeting was taking place.<br/>Ranma Saotome was not present, but a new pair of faces stared at the<br/>group calmly.<p>"So, why are we here?" said Jadeite as he glared at the pair of<br/>teens standing with Akane.<p>"They know about us," said Akane calmly as she glanced back at the<br/>pair over her shoulder for a moment.<p>"That's easily fixed," said Kunzite as he frowned at them.<p>"I'm not sure how much they know, or when the learned it," said<br/>Akane. "They aren't talking yet."<p>"We are here you know," said Gohan irritably.<p>"You said his name is...Gohan?" said Nephrite in confusion as he<br/>looked at the pair. .<p>"Shut up!" snapped the boy angrily.<p>"What the hell is this?" said Kunzite as he started to grow<br/>impatient.<p>"This is about your future," said Trunks as he frowned at them. He<br/>had a more serious tone to his voice and an almost permanent scowl.<br/>"We were sent back to keep you alive."<p>"Sent back?" said Jadeite as he narrowed his eyes at them.<p>"From the future, we were sent by Neo Queen Usagi the second,"<br/>said Gohan as he snorted at them. "You know her as Chibi-Usa."<p>That got their attention.<p>"What the hell are you going to do to keep us alive?" snorted<br/>Zocite.<p>"Ranma Saotome isn't who you think he is," said Trunks calmly.<br/>"There's something terribly wrong on Earth right now."<p>"You're being a little vague," said Zocite.<p>"We can only reveal enough to get you too believe us," said Trunks<br/>as he shook his head. "Time travel is dangerous enough as it is."<p>"This is..." grumbled Akane as she held her head.<p>"Ranma Saotome freed you from Beryl's power a few months ago,"<br/>said Gohan to the males. "He formed this organization to fight her,<br/>keep the senshi in check, and basically pick up where you left off<br/>during the Silver Millenium. However, you may notice that he's been<br/>acting a bit strangely lately."<p>The room was silent for a long moment. Zocite growled under his<br/>breath. "What would you know about that?"<p>"Ranma has fallen under Beryl's control," said Trunks with a rough<br/>snort.<p>"What?" said Jadeite as he jumped from his seat. The others did<br/>much the same without voicing it.<p>"It doesn't get better, in a few months time, he'll go insane, and<br/>kill most of the people in this room," said Trunks as he glared at<br/>Jadeite directly. His eyes turned towards Akane and softened somewhat.<br/>"All of you but Akane."<p>"What's with you man?" said Gohan as he waved his hand in front of<br/>his companion's face for a moment.<p>"It's nothing," grumbled Trunks as he looked away from her<br/>purposefully. "In any case, he manages to break Beryl's control."<p>"So it's not so bad," said Kunzite with a relieved sigh.<p>"No, it's worse. He doesn't break her control because he turns<br/>back, he grows stronger than her, and overpowers her will. He'll take<br/>over the entire planet, and bring an age of darkness with him," said<br/>Gohan. "He kills most of the human population of the planet, and<br/>basically renders the planet inhospitable. He was eventually defeated,<br/>and the planet was healed..."<p>The room was looking at the pair in shocked silence once again.<p>"This is nuts!" cried Zocite.<p>Akane turned to look at him for a moment. "Ranma has been acting<br/>strangely lately."<p>"Destroying the entire planet? What about his daughter?"<p>"Chibi-Usa is in on the whole thing," said Trunks as he smirked at<br/>the man. "She was sent back, much like we where. In order to keep<br/>things on track, and make sure they went the way they were supposed<br/>too."<p>"You want us to fight him?" snorted Nephrite. "We'll be wiped<br/>out."<p>"I know," said Gohan as he smirked at the man. "We aren't going to<br/>fight him. That's not our job."<p>"Why should we trust you?" asked Kunzite.<p>"Because if you don't, you'll all die rather horrible deaths in<br/>the near future," replied Trunks calmly. "We aren't asking you to<br/>fight him, you'd lose if you did anyway."<p>"So, what is the plan?" said Akane irritably.<p>"We're going to leave Japan," said Trunks.<p>"And go where?" asked Kunzite.<p>"China, I won't say more than that now," said Gohan as he smirked<br/>at them.<p>"What? This could be a Youma trick!" said Jadeite as he glared at<br/>the pair.<p>"You'd be dead already if it was, the Youma don't care about you,<br/>you're too weak to hurt them anyway," said Gohan with a small shrug.<p>"What's this too you anyway?" said Jadeite as he frowned at the<br/>pair. "What do you care about us?"<p>"We don't particularly," replied Gohan as he scratched at his ear.<br/>Trunks elbowed him in the ribs and growled.<p>"Ranma Saotome is our grandfather," said the longhaired boy as he<br/>unwrapped his tail from around his waist.<p>"..." said Akane as she stared at them.<p>"Look, we don't have much time, we have to leave now. Ranma<br/>probably has this place bugged," said Gohan as he frowned at them.<p>"So, this is an ultimatum?" said Jadeite with a small chuckle.<p>"Basically," said Trunks with a small shrug. "We can protect you,<br/>but we can't fight Ranma ourselves."<p>"Why not?" asked Kunzite as he frowned at the pair.<p>"Because if they killed him, they'd cease to exist," said a<br/>familiar voice from behind them.<p>"Actually, the old guy is training at the moment, we can't really<br/>fight him because he's stronger than us. I begged Mom to send us back<br/>a little sooner, but she insisted..." The boy hung his head slightly<br/>and sighed.<p>The group turned to see Sailor Pluto frowning at them all. She<br/>narrowed her eyes at them and scanned the room for a moment. "The time<br/>stream is a mess, there's no clear view of anything in the future.<br/>That says their story is probably true. They came through the time<br/>gates a few hours ago."<p>"Hey Puu!" said Gohan cheerfully.<p>Pluto glanced at him in confusion for a moment and turned back to<br/>the room. "We have no choice but to believe them."<p>"How did you find this place?" said Jadeite as he frowned at her.<p>"I followed them," said the woman as she nodded towards Gohan,<br/>Trunks, and Akane.<p>"The Senshi's interests are similar to ours, they wouldn't want us<br/>dead," said Akane. She glanced at Pluto again and back at the pair.<p>"Their story is becoming more credible," agreed Zocite.<p>"The Senshi are not on the planet at the moment," said Pluto as<br/>she glanced at the pair. "I shall meet you with my daughter in China,<br/>I have no choice but to place my trust in you at the moment."<p>"Boy, she sure is enthusiastic," said Jadeite as he frowned at<br/>her.<p>"Hey, ya think she likes me?" asked Gohan as he turned towards<br/>Trunks. "Gotta make a good impression..."<p>"Man, you're hopeless," grumbled the other teen as he rolled his<br/>eyes.<p>"You're no better with the ghoul!" retorted the boy as he punched<br/>his companion upside his head.<p>"Hey! That hurt!" snapped Trunks.<p>"Stop that!" snapped Akane.<p>"Yes sensei," replied the pair in unison, everyone else blinked as<br/>the pair bowed to her slightly, in what appeared to be a reflex<br/>action.<p>"Looks like we've got to believe them, I don't like this though,"<br/>said Jadeite as he frowned at them.<p>"Smells like a trap," snorted Kunzite.<p>"Man, you old guys sure are paranoid," grumbled Gohan.<p>"Old?" said Zocite as he stared at the pair for a moment.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma smiled as he stood over Chibi-Usa. He cracked his knuckles<br/>and turned away from her with a calm air about him. "Pathetic."<p>The saiyan girl growled as she pushed herself upright and growled<br/>at him. "You'll pay for that old man."<p>"Humph, I'm not even breaking a sweat anymore spore," said the man<br/>calmly as he turned his glare back onto her again. "You're rather<br/>pathetic now."<p>Chibi-Usa ground her teeth together in frustration, sparks of<br/>power flew off her body as she glared at him in a rage. "How? How did<br/>he get so strong? I could have wiped the floor with him a few weeks<br/>ago!" she thought angrily.<p>Ranma paused, as if deciding to stay a bit longer rather than<br/>simply walk off. "Do you really want to know?"<p>"Huh?" said the girl as she looked at him with a confused frown on<br/>her face.<p>"You're wondering why I'm so strong now, correct?" said the man as<br/>he glanced back at her again. "You've been ignoring my calls, and my<br/>orders to train harder. Now you see what it gets you. You've grown<br/>weak, satisfied with your current power. When my other self returns,<br/>he will be much stronger. You'd best be ready spore."<p>"What do you mean?" growled the girl angrily. Her form shifted<br/>into a woman's body and she staggered to her feet finally.<p>"Come, I'll show you," said Ranma as he started walking away<br/>again.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"What is this?" said Chibi-Usa as she stared at the gym like room<br/>she found herself standing in.<p>"Heh, I had Kuroi create it for me," said Ranma as he smirked at<br/>the scene. "We've been using energy gathered in our operations to<br/>power this subspace pocket. It's a dimension of my own design, I<br/>control every aspect of it. The Gravity, the temperature...you get the<br/>idea."<p>"This is where you've been for the past few weeks?" said the girl<br/>as she stared at him for a moment.<p>Ranma chuckled at this reaction. "Of course. We're going to have<br/>one hell of a fight when my other self returns. You're going to spend<br/>your time training with me in here from this point on."<p>Chibi-Usa growled at the order, but didn't argue.<p>"Humph, you'd best get used to this fast, because I'm not going to<br/>slow down just for you, you'll just have to catch up." He closed his<br/>eyes for a moment and the woman slammed into the ground, her legs<br/>giving way under her own weight.<p>"It's only five hundred times the planet's gravity at the moment,<br/>just a warm up for me. I suggest you get used to it quickly, because<br/>tomorrow I'm going to double it. Get to work." He turned away and left<br/>her lying on the ground, gasping for breath from the weight on her<br/>chest and the impact.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks smirked as he landed on the roof of the Mikon Taka and<br/>looked around. "Looks like we've been expected."<p>A group of rather nervous looking guards stood around staring at<br/>them.<p>"What?" said Ryoko as she landed beside him lightly.<p>"Come on, we've got to check on the others. We've got a schedule<br/>to keep," said Trunks with a small shrug.<p>"Schedule?" said Tenchi.<p>"Your training is complete, but the Senshi still have to be ready<br/>for the battles to come," said Hotaru with her icy calm tone.<p>"Okay," said Tenchi as he shrugged and jumped down into their<br/>escort.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>"Well, nice to meet you," said Trunks as he smirked at the<br/>Emperor.<p>Yosho arched his eyebrow as the boy walked up boldly to the center<br/>of the room and eyed Azusa coolly. He was sitting off to the side with<br/>the Senshi.<p>"Show some respect!" demanded one of the nobles near to the<br/>Emperor's side.<p>"Heh, I'm the most powerful being in this room," said the boy as<br/>he leveled a cold glare on the man. Wisely, the noble quickly took his<br/>seat. "If anyone demands respect, it's me," said the boy as he glanced<br/>around the room. There were numerous scandalized gasps and mutters at<br/>this, but no one voiced any protest. The boy had beaten something that<br/>had defeated even the Emperor of Jurai, not to mention the fact that<br/>the young prince was standing beside him. A boy with a command of the<br/>Wings of the Light Hawk like he had was nothing to be scoffed at.<p>"In any case, we owe you our gratitude," said Azusa through his<br/>teeth.<p>"Yeah, something like that. I trained Tenchi for ya, he's stronger<br/>than you are now. Hope you appreciate it." The boy jerked his thumb<br/>back at the teen behind him.<p>"Hey! Try to be a little polite sensei!" pleaded Tenchi nervously.<p>"Whatever," said Trunks as he rolled his eyes.<p>Ryoko was oddly silent, but seemed to be enjoying the scene.<p>Washuu stood up and walked over to him. "You haven't changed much<br/>over the years have you?"<p>The boy scratched the back of his head and grinned at her.<p>Everyone looked at him in confusion but didn't press the matter.<p>Azusa stood up and sighed deeply. "You could at least pretend to<br/>be respectful."<p>"Why?" said the boy with a shrug. "I've got work to do, then I can<br/>go back and kick Ranma's ass. After that, I'll be out of your hair for<br/>good most likely."<p>Azusa noticed Ryoko standing unusually close to Tenchi's side. His<br/>eyes fell on Ayeka, who was sitting nearby. She was wringing a<br/>handkerchief in her hands and twitching. She was trying, and failing<br/>to keep a dignified expression on her face. He sighed and shook his<br/>head. "There will be a feast tonight to commemorate this occasion. You<br/>are all invited of course, and to the ball afterwards."<p>Trunks grinned at this. "Great! Food!"<p>"Thank you, your highness," said Tenchi with a small bow of his<br/>head.<p>"Ball?" said Usagi as she blinked. She felt a small sense of dread<br/>at the mention of the word. An image of a giant red-haired man with a<br/>keg under his arm and a pair of panties on his head filled her mind<br/>for reasons she couldn't explain. A shiver ran down her spine, but she<br/>quickly pushed them aside. The man in the image was wearing a plaid<br/>skirt as well, it was somewhat unsettling.<p>"So, now what?" asked Ryoko.<p>"Well, we need sleep," announced Trunks as he started to walk out<br/>of the room without being dismissed. This sent another uproar of anger<br/>and frustration among the nobles. No one voiced this very loudly<br/>though, and Azusa seemed beyond caring.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Washuu smiled at Trunks as he lay on the sheets of the giant bed<br/>in the room the Juraians had supplied him. He was staring at the<br/>ceiling with a somewhat thoughtful frown on his face.<p>"Hello again," said the woman as she strolled up to him.<p>"Huh? Oh, hey," replied the boy as he picked his head up and<br/>blinked. "I wonder why they gave me such a huge bed? I'm not that<br/>big." He looked around at the massive mattress for a moment. "You<br/>could fit about fifty of me on this thing."<p>"Well, it is a palace," said the redhead as she smirked at him.<br/>She sat down on the edge of the bed and smiled at him.<p>The boy jumped up and bounced over too her side. "D'ya want<br/>somethin?"<p>"I need to speak with you..." said the redhead with a small sigh.<p>"Huh? About the project? Is there a problem?"<p>"No, everything is fine with that actually, couldn't be better to<br/>be honest. We're actually ahead of schedule. The special modifications<br/>on your room are almost finished as well. Should be done in a week's<br/>time."<p>"Great!" said the boy as he smirked at her.<p>"This is about that girl, the earthling..."<p>"What's up?" asked Trunks as he stared at Washuu. "What has she<br/>done now?"<p>"She hasn't done anything yet, but I think she knows who you<br/>really are," said the redhead as she stared at the wall for a moment.<br/>"I don't think she noticed, but she called you by name on the ship<br/>during the fight."<p>"Did she?" said Trunks as he flopped back on the sheets and spread<br/>his arms out. "That could be a problem, but I'm not really surprised."<p>"What should we do about it?"<p>"Nothing," said Trunks.<p>"If the Senshi find out..."<p>"It's easy to explain," replied the boy as he chuckled. "I just<br/>gave them something a bit more believable than the truth. No big<br/>deal."<p>"You could lose their trust," said Washuu carefully.<p>"That's the least of my worries, having the senshi like me isn't<br/>something I care about. They won't like me at all when I'm through<br/>with them, but they'll respect me." He smirked at her and winked.<p>"What about that girl?" said Washuu.<p>"I've got a special place for her," replied the boy as he grinned<br/>at Washuu. "If she's figured me out already, then she's smarter than I<br/>thought she was. Don't worry."<p>The woman nodded and stood up. "All right, I suppose I should just<br/>trust you this time."<p>"Yeah," said the boy as he smiled at her again.<p>"Oh, one more thing..." said Washuu as she turned around again.<p>"Huh?" said Trunks as he looked at her again.<p>"You're supposed to wear this to the ball, it's formal," said the<br/>woman as she held out a clothing bag to him.<p>"Eh?" said the boy as he blinked at the package. He opened it and<br/>stared inside for a moment. "Hell no."<p>"Wasn't my idea. I think Azusa is still a little miffed at being<br/>shown up earlier."<p>"Well he can blow it out his ass. I'm not wearing this thing." The<br/>boy pulled out a handful of purple feathers. He couldn't tell if they<br/>were attached to the collar or the waist on the thing. "There is no<br/>way in hell I'm going to wear this."<p>"Well, you've got about a day to figure something out. You've got<br/>to wear something, I mean those clothes you've got on won't work."<p>The boy looked down at himself. He was wearing an ill fitting pair<br/>of pants and a white muscle shirt. "I guess you're right..." He<br/>searched around in his pockets and came up with some Juraian currency.<p>"Where did you get that?" said Washuu as she stared at the rather<br/>impressive wad.<p>"Tenchi gave it too me. Ayeka gave him a huge bundle when they<br/>first showed up, and he didn't know what to do with it, so he gave it<br/>away. I don't have much use for it myself, but it was a nice gesture."<br/>The boy shrugged and fumbled about through the pile. "Feel like taking<br/>a trip?"<p>Washuu blinked and shrugged her shoulders.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ryoko opened the door to her room a few hours before the party.<br/>"Hey," she said as Trunks tossed a package into her chest and grinned.<p>"Huh?" said the woman as she stared at it.<p>"For the party tonight, Ryoko and Hotaru have one too.<p>The woman stared at it for a moment and said nothing. "Um,<br/>okay..."<p>The boy turned away and walked down the hall with a cheerful<br/>whistle.<p>Ryoko stared at it for a moment and went back into her room.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"Lord Tenchi..." said Ayeka as she walked into the boy's room and<br/>glanced around.<p>"Oh, hey Ayeka," said Tenchi cheerfully as he stepped aside from<br/>the door to let her inside. "What's up?"<p>"Well, I haven't seen you since you left the other day..." said<br/>the girl as she blushed slightly.<p>"Yeah, I've been pretty busy," said the boy with a cheerful nod.<br/>"Is there something I can do for you?"<p>"Well, I just wanted to see how you were doing," said the princess<br/>as she smiled at him.<p>"Oh, I'm fine. Don't worry," said the boy as he grinned at her.<p>"Have you been treated well?" she inquired.<p>"Huh? Everyone's been very nice, but I haven't really had time to<br/>notice to be honest, I've been training hard. This is the first time<br/>in a long while I've been able to relax really." He smiled at her<br/>warmly.<p>"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have allowed you to be taken away like<br/>that," said the girl with a small frown.<p>"Huh? Don't worry about it Ayeka, I didn't mind at all. I'm much<br/>stronger thanks to Trunks," said the boy cheerfully.<p>"But, being stuck alone with that monster woman for an entire<br/>year. It must have been very hard."<p>Tenchi blinked at this and looked at the ceiling. "Not really.<br/>Ryoko and I get along all right. We were training most of the time we<br/>were in there, Trunks and Hotaru didn't give us a lot of free time."<p>"That's a relief," said Ayeka with a small sigh.<p>"Huh? What do you mean?" asked Tenchi dumbly.<p>"Oh? It's nothing, I'll see you this evening?"<p>"Yeah," said the boy cheerfully.<p>"Save a dance for me Tenchi," said the girl as she bowed and<br/>turned away.<p>"Okay, I will," said the boy with a nervous grin.<p>The princess excused herself politely and walked out of the room.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Azusa sat on a throne on one end of the ballroom with his wives on<br/>either side of him. Funaho smiled at the nobles politely, and Misaki<br/>had a somewhat cheerful grin on her face. Both of the women were being<br/>polite to those that kneeled in front of the Emperor, but Azusa simply<br/>looked bored and intimidating.<p>The room was spacious and there was a long table that took up the<br/>entire edge of the room along the wall. There were chairs sitting<br/>around the tables, but no one was sitting yet. It was a social event<br/>so far and dignitaries conversed with each other in the middle of the<br/>room.<p>"They're late," grumbled Azusa irritably.<p>Yosho was standing nearby and frowned a little at this.<p>"I hope they're all right," commented Ayeka. "Perhaps we should<br/>send someone too..."<p>Usagi and her friends were grouped around the middle of the room<br/>in elaborate gowns. The colors matched their senshi uniforms and they<br/>had wide skirts and tight tops with low necklines. They appeared<br/>somewhat nervous and a little out of place, the occasional noble had<br/>to be dodged by a few of them as he made a pass.<p>Nabiki frowned at the girls as they stood around her. Her dress<br/>was cut much slimmer than the others' clothes, it revealed a bit more<br/>as well. It was dark red, with a slit that ran all the way up to her<br/>hips on the right side. "This is annoying."<p>"Disgusting old perverts aren't they?" commented Rei.<p>"I think someone grabbed my ass," said Makoto as she eyed a<br/>particular group of males that hovered nearby with a distasteful<br/>frown.<p>"You're not sure?" said Nabiki as she cocked her eyebrow at the<br/>girl.<p>Makoto blushed a little at this but remained silent.<p>"I haven't seen Washuu," said Usagi as she glanced around the<br/>room.<p>"She's over by Yosho," said Minako as she pointed at the prince<br/>and the redhead. They were standing side by side and conversing idly.<br/>"Maybe we should go over and talk to them?"<p>"I don't want to be too near the Emperor, I don't think he likes<br/>us much," said Rei as she frowned at the intimidating looking man. "I<br/>hate to admit it, but I'll feel better about being here when Trunks<br/>and Tenchi show up."<p>"Do you think they're coming?" asked Usagi.<p>"I hope so, Ayeka says they'll be here," replied Minako.<p>The great doors of the hall opened and four figures walked into<br/>the room calmly. "Heh, so, this is Jurai's idea of a party?" said<br/>Trunks as he glanced around the room.<p>Tenchi, Ryoko, and Hotaru were just behind them, they were all<br/>wearing bright orange tunics with a small white circle on the right<br/>chest. The pants were baggy and all of them had on a pair of high top<br/>boots with flat soles. The kanji for 'horse' was inside the circle<br/>with another larger one on the back with the same symbol in it.<p>Azusa eyed them all for a moment in confusion. They weren't<br/>wearing the clothes he'd sent too them. After a moment he frowned.<p>"Heh," said the young Trunks as he eyed the Emperor for a moment<br/>and then turned his gaze to survey the room.<p>Tenchi moved up beside him. "Why'd it get so quiet?"<p>"I dunno," said Ryoko as she stepped back slightly.<p>"Ah, it seems the guests of honor have arrived, so we may begin,"<br/>said Azusa as he stood up and grinned at them.<p>"Boy, I can already tell this party is gonna suck," muttered<br/>Trunks as he glanced around at the nobles.<p>"Heh, you expected better?" said Ryoko as she glanced down at him.<p>"Humph," snorted Hotaru. The boy should have known what to expect,<br/>he'd been too enough events like this as Genaku in the past. Or<br/>rather, he'd ruined enough events to be permanently banned from any<br/>and all balls by the queen herself. The girl suddenly tensed as she<br/>looked down at the boy and realized who he was. "Oh boy..."<p>Trunks smirked at her shocked expression. "Don't worry, I'll<br/>behave."<p>This seemed to alleviate her somewhat.<p>The boy strolled forward with his student's behind him.<p>"The clothes I sent you were not satisfactory?" said Azusa as the<br/>boy neared him.<p>"I felt it was appropriate for us to wear the uniform of my<br/>school," replied the boy calmly. "They are all my students, and they<br/>have earned the right to wear my symbol."<p>Azusa eyed Tenchi for a moment and said nothing. "Very well, shall<br/>we eat?"<p>"You know how to keep a Saiyan happy don't ya?" said the boy as he<br/>grinned at the man.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>The meal was quite boring, nobles exchanged idle chat in what was<br/>obviously just another excuse to get together and discuss political<br/>matters. The off world party sat next to the Emperor on his left side,<br/>with Misaki directly at his side.<p>Trunks ate like a true Saiyan, as did Ryoko, Hotaru restrained<br/>herself for appearance sake. Usagi was directly next to her and looked<br/>somewhat uncomfortable.<p>Yosho and Tenchi sat beside each other next to Funaho and Ayeka.<p>"So, what are your plans now?" asked Azusa as he frowned at Trunks<br/>for a moment.<p>"We'll continue training in a few days. Washuu needs a few more<br/>days to prepare for that, after that we'll leave and return home."<p>"To free your planet?" said the man with a small nod.<p>"Something like that," said the boy as he nodded seriously. "In<br/>any case, we appreciate the help."<p>Azusa snorted and shook his head for a moment. "I see. These<br/>girls?"<p>"I don't know. The Moon Kingdom's fate is up to them," replied the<br/>boy as he glanced at the Senshi for a moment. "They may choose to<br/>revive it, or they may decide to go another way. It's up to them.<br/>Either way though, you're going to lose your control of the Earth. Not<br/>that you had much to begin with anyway."<p>Azusa nodded at this. "It doesn't concern me. The planet was<br/>useless to us for the most part anyway."<p>Trunks nodded at this and smirked. "Not that you could do anything<br/>about it anyway."<p>The man's gaze widened a tiny bit at this.<p>"Heh, got ya!" said the boy as he chuckled and pointed at the man.<br/>"Yer fun to tease ya know that? Always so serious."<p>This caught the man off guard again and he growled under his<br/>breath.<p>"Quit teasing him," said Hotaru as she smacked him in the back of<br/>his head.<p>"Aw, come on! It's fun!"<p>"You're gonna make him mad idiot!" snapped the girl as she turned<br/>her head away from him. "Did you forget he's got an entire star fleet<br/>and an army?"<p>"Nah," said the boy. "I remembered."<p>The guests had stopped eating at this point and were moving into<br/>the middle of the room. A band was set up on one side of the room and<br/>they started to play music. It was soft at the moment and the Emperor<br/>strolled into the middle of the room to start the first dance with his<br/>two wives.<p>"Man, he's big enough to dance with both of them," commented<br/>Trunks as he watched the scene for a moment.<p>"Well, I suppose we should dance too," said Hotaru as she frowned<br/>slightly. "It would be impolite to not dance at least once."<p>"With who? I'm like two feet tall," said Trunks as he pointed at<br/>himself for a moment.<p>Everyone looked down at him for a moment.<p>"You guys dance, I'm gonna go find Nabiki. I gotta talk to her."<br/>The boy wandered into the crowd leaving the group alone.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>"What do you want?" said Nabiki as she glared down at the child in<br/>front of her coldly.<p>"Don't be so harsh, I've seen you naked before, that should count<br/>for something!" said the boy as he looked at her with his cutest<br/>expression.<p>The girl felt her stomach turn at the sight of it. "I'm assuming<br/>you've got a reason for bringing me out here?"<p>"Well, you know who I really am, thought we'd talk about that,"<br/>said the boy as he smirked at her.<p>Nabiki narrowed her eyes at him.<p>"You slipped up, Washuu and Yosho noticed you call me 'Ranma',"<br/>continued Trunks as he smiled at her. "I'm not surprised you figured<br/>it out, but I need to be sure you keep the secret for a while."<p>"Why should I?" said the girl irritably.<p>"Because I need them to trust me a bit for a little while," said<br/>the boy with a shrug.<p>"What do I get out of this if I keep your secret?" snorted the<br/>girl.<p>"Nothing," said Trunks calmly. "You also get nothing if you tell<br/>the others, so either you get nothing."<p>"I could probably gain something," replied the girl as she looked<br/>down at him again and smirked.<p>"You may be right," said the boy cheerfully. "You're a smart one,<br/>I like that."<p>Nabiki blinked at this, but remained silent.<p>"Heh, you'll come to regret that soon enough," said Trunks as he<br/>started walking back towards the hall again. The boy paused and looked<br/>somewhat surprised for a moment. "Hey, something is up..."<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>"I was planning on returning to Earth with Lord Tenchi Father,"<br/>said Ayeka as she looked at the Emperor for a moment.<p>"Eh?" said the man as he looked at his daughter for a moment.<p>"Oh boy," grumbled Ryoko from nearby.<p>"What's going on?" asked Tenchi.<p>"I'm not sure," said Washuu as she strolled up to his side.<p>The Emperor closed his eyes and frowned. "So, you will remain<br/>there?"<p>"Yes," said the girl with a somewhat nervous step back.<p>"If that is your wish," said the Emperor with a small nod.<p>"Oh, thank you for understanding father!" said Ayeka.<p>"Damn," grumbled Ryoko under her breath.<p>"Under one condition!" exclaimed the Emperor.<p>Yosho looked at the man from nearby; he had been talking with his<br/>mother and was glad for the distraction. She was questioning him on<br/>why he hadn't contacted her for the past few hundred years. "Eh?"<p>Funaho seemed to lose interest in the conversation at this point<br/>as well and looked at her husband with an unreadable gaze.<p>Azusa drew himself up. "If that boy can defeat the man I chose as<br/>your fiancee! I will grant your wish."<p>"Well, so much for that," said Ryoko with a small shrug. "Guess<br/>you're coming back with us huh princess?"<p>Ayeka looked at her for a moment with her jaw hanging down<br/>slightly. "Um..."<p>"What?" said Tenchi as he stared at the man for a moment.<br/>"But...I..."<p>A man strolled through the crowd and smirked at Tenchi. He was<br/>dressed in elaborate Juraian robes and had a smirk on his face. He had<br/>pink hair and a fan covered his face. "Well, I've been waiting for<br/>this moment. It seems you're a bit out of your league boy, best give<br/>up now."<p>"What the?" muttered Tenchi dumbly.<p>"Oops, I've forgotten to introduce myself. Princess Ayeka, you<br/>look just fabulous!"<p>Azusa coughed into his hand and interrupted the newcomer. "Listen<br/>and listen well! If that boy can defeat him, you can do whatever you<br/>like."<p>Trunks appeared out of the crowd with Nabiki at his side. "Hey,<br/>who's this gay guy?" he jerked his thumb at the pink haired man.<p>"What?" said the man as he stared at the boy.<p>"Well..." said Tenchi.<p>Sasami walked up next to Tenchi, having moved from Misaki's side.<br/>"I'm rooting for you Tenchi!"<p>"Lord Tenchi! You are willing to fight for us aren't you?" said<br/>Ayeka.<p>"Well...I..."<p>"Tenchi! Don't fight! You don't have to do this for them!" cried<br/>Ryoko as she shoved the princess aside.<p>Misaki shoved a page into the woman's face.<p>"Huh? What's that?" muttered Ryoko.<p>"This is a bill for you, for all those parts of Jurai you<br/>destroyed," said the woman cheerfully.<p>"Hey! She worked that off when she fought Buu!" said Trunks as he<br/>stared at the woman. "Besides, it's kinda gross getting married to<br/>your own great aunt."<p>Ayeka turned red. "What! Maybe on Earth, but..."<p>"What are you nuts? Tenchi is mostly human. Humans don't inbreed<br/>for a reason. Unlike Juraians, inbreeding can cause birth defects and<br/>mental problems. Humans are designed biologically to diversify, it's<br/>bad news to go against that," said the boy with a small nod.<p>"What?" muttered Ayeka.<p>"That shouldn't be a problem here my boy," said Yosho calmly.<p>"Eh?" said Trunks.<p>"You're right in your fears, but Juraians aren't wired that way.<br/>It won't pose any problems, if Tenchi chooses that path," agreed<br/>Washuu.<p>"Whatever, Tenchi, you've got to accept this challenge on behalf<br/>of the school though!" said Trunks firmly.<p>"Huh? But you just said..." stammered the boy in confusion.<p>"Bah! That doesn't matter! It's a matter of honor, you've got to<br/>uphold the school! You must accept any challenge!" said Trunks as he<br/>nodded to himself. "I just wanted to make sure you were fighting for<br/>the right reasons!"<p>"School?" muttered Yosho as he looked at the boy. He seemed to<br/>just notice what his grandson was wearing. "I see."<p>"Huh?" said Tenchi.<p>"Very well boy, if that is the path you have chosen," said the man<br/>as he nodded at the boy.<p>"Hey, wait a minute!" said Tenchi as he found himself shoved<br/>forward on several fronts towards the pink haired man. "All right,<br/>fine."<p>"Just take it easy on him Tenchi," said Ryoko cheerfully.<p>"No! If you hold back you'll be hurt!" cried Ayeka.<p>"Ryoko is right boy, best not make too much of a mess, try to keep<br/>it toned down," agreed Trunks.<p>The man laughed to himself. "Really, it's really a waste of time.<br/>It's rather one sided, he really has no chance. I must fulfill the<br/>wish of the Emperor. After all, he is my future father in law."<p>Tenchi stood off against the man with an uncertain frown on his<br/>face. "Oh man..."<p>"Kick his ass Tenchi!" cried Trunks cheerfully. "Do it, you'll<br/>enjoy it!"<p>"I'm not so sure about that," said the boy nervously.<p>"Say, how long do you think it's going to take Tenchi to defeat<br/>Cerio?" asked Misaki as she walked up to her husband.<p>The man grunted. "Just watch, Cerio is going to defeat Tenchi in<br/>less than a minute," grumbled Azusa.<p>"Heh. Cerio didn't fight Majin Buu with us old man, his power is<br/>nothing to Tenchi," said Trunks. "You forget, Yosho has been training<br/>him for most of his life as well. You're not really dumb enough to<br/>believe that he'll win are you?"<p>The Emperor glared at the boy, but Trunks ignored him and kept his<br/>eyes on the battle.<p>"Tenchi, put that sword away! You don't need it," called the boy<br/>as he smirked at the two combatants.<p>Tenchi looked at Tenchi-ken for a moment and put it into his<br/>robes. "If you say so."<p>Cerio chuckled at this. "You are a fool! Giving up so easily?"<p>The boy merely smirked at his opponent. "Ya know, this might<br/>actually be a little fun." Cerio was starting to get on his nerves.<p>"Give it to that bastard!" cried Ryoko as she raised her fist into<br/>the air.<p>"Hmm, ignorance is your weakness. You don't seem to understand<br/>that you are no match for me. I don't think you want to go through<br/>with this, it's simply for your own good. I don't want to humiliate<br/>you, you know?" said Cerio.<p>Tenchi was growing more and more irate.<p>"He's developed something of a temper," commented Washuu in<br/>surprise.<p>"Tenchi has trained hard for his skills, that idiot is belittling<br/>his power. I taught him that he should be proud of his skill, false<br/>humility says nothing for a warrior like him," said Trunks.<p>"Humility is an important aspect of the art," said Yosho in<br/>disgust.<p>"Confidence in your own abilities is more important, Tenchi knows<br/>he can win, and he knows when he has to fight. Unlike when you trained<br/>him, he's sure of himself and the outcome of the battle," replied<br/>Trunks. "It's the one fault I could find in the training you gave him.<br/>He didn't think he could really win against Kagato, it almost<br/>destroyed him."<p>Yosho stared at the boy for a long moment and turned back at<br/>Tenchi. "It seems we differ in our opinions."<p>Trunks merely nodded.<p>"You want to concede? A wise choice for a barbarian like you..."<br/>said Cerio.<p>"I don't think so," replied Tenchi calmly. He shifted his weight<br/>back and put up his fists. "I'm ready for you."<p>Cerio blinked at this. "Are you sure?"<p>Tenchi nodded.<p>"Very well, I suppose I'll have to hold back my true power, as to<br/>not humiliate you," said Cerio.<p>"If you do, you'll lose," replied Tenchi. An aura burst to life<br/>around him, blue flame that seemed to burn away his clothes. Within a<br/>moment he was wearing Juraian battle armor and had a cold frown on his<br/>face.<p>Cerio stepped back and stared at the boy. "What?"<p>"Should we start now?" asked Tenchi.<p>The man shrieked girlishly and backed away.<p>"Hey! You can't run from a challenge like that! Get back in<br/>there!" cried Trunks as she shoved the man back towards Tenchi as he<br/>tried to step into the crowd and tensed to run.<p>Cerio seemed to realize that everyone was watching him and<br/>frowned. "It seems, I cannot allow you to escape, though it pains my<br/>heart too..."<p>"Shut up and fight Kuno!" snapped Trunks.<p>Everyone looked at him for a moment.<p>"Sorry," muttered the boy sheepishly.<p>"Enough, fight!" said Azusa angrily.<p>Cerio swallowed and stepped forward. "I strike!"<p>Tenchi promptly decked him with a casual looking right hook.<p>Cerio flew across the room over the crowd and slammed into the<br/>wall. "No fair...I didn't...even get my weapon...ready..." he muttered<br/>as he slowly slid down the wall and onto the floor.<p>Tenchi looked at his fist for a moment and scratched the back of<br/>his head. "Oops. I guess that was too much."<p>The crowd was in a state of silent awe.<p>"Man, that was lame," grumbled Trunks.<p>"I had hoped it would last a bit longer," agreed Hotaru.<p>"Yay Tenchi!" cried Sasami.<p>Ayeka breathed a sigh of relief. She straightened herself up and<br/>turned towards the boy.<p>"Good shot Tenchi," said Ryoko with a smirk on her face as she and<br/>Tenchi put their fists together.<p>"Thanks," he replied calmly.<p>Ayeka shoved Ryoko aside and grabbed the boy around his neck. "Oh<br/>Tenchi! You saved me!"<p>The boy blinked in surprise and laughed nervously. "I did?"<p>"You've done the school proud boy!" cried Trunks as he clenched<br/>his fist tightly. He had tears of pride on his face.<p>"Idiot," grumbled Hotaru as she stared at him.<p>"Tenchi, what is this art you have learned?" thought Yosho to<br/>himself. He wasn't sure if he liked it or not.<p>"Well, it's been a gas, but we've got work to do tomorrow," said<br/>Trunks as he pat Azusa on his shoulder by floating up to the correct<br/>height. "The others can enjoy the party for a while, but Washuu and I<br/>need sleep."<p>The redhead nodded and turned towards the door. "I suppose you're<br/>right. Tomorrow I've got to return to the project."<p>"Great!" said Trunks cheerfully. "Should be ready in a few days<br/>then?"<p>The woman nodded. "I still need some more input from you, on<br/>exactly what you want."<p>"We'll talk about that in the morning. I could sleep like a rock<br/>right now," said the boy as he started towards the doors as well.<p>Azusa sighed and turned back to his throne, the music started<br/>playing again and everyone went back to the party.<p>Trunks looked over his shoulder and sighed. "Man, these Juraians<br/>sure throw crappy parties."<p>"Thanks for saving me," muttered Washuu from his side.<p>"Yeah, I don't think I could have taken much more," grumbled the<br/>boy.<p>"Quit trying to egg the Emperor into a fight," said Washuu as she<br/>looked at him for a moment.<p>"Aw, come on. It'd be fun!" exclaimed the boy pathetically as he<br/>hung his head.<p>"We need his help!" snapped Washuu. "If he decided he doesn't want<br/>us here, it will be difficult to finish the project. We only need a<br/>few more weeks."<p>Trunks sighed and nodded his head. "Fine."<p>"Come on, we should go," said the woman as she turned away. "We<br/>can find a real party."<p>"Yeah, maybe we can find a good bar or something..." muttered<br/>Trunks cheerfully. "Say, does this planet have nude entertainment?"<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Bwahahahahahahaaaa!" cried Washuu as she waved her fans and stood<br/>on the table. She had a wad of money in her hand and a muscular<br/>Juraian was dancing on the table.<p>Trunks was sitting quietly beside her, hanging his head and<br/>wishing it would all just go away. "This isn't exactly what I meant<br/>Washuu." He picked up his drink and downed it in a single gulp.<p>Another muscular and half-dressed Juraian brought him another one.<p>"Aw, come on! Loosen up!" exclaimed the woman.<p>"I think I'm going to leave now..." muttered Trunks as he stood<br/>up.<p>"The fun's just starting! There's a wet jock strap contest in a<br/>few minutes!" cried Washuu.<p>Trunks rushed out the door, knocking several of the men aside as<br/>he ran for his very sanity.<p>"I wonder what's with him? Oh well!" She turned back to the man<br/>dancing for her and grinned. "Do you want to be my new guinea pig?"<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...
