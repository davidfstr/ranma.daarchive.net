</div>Insertion<p>Part 14<p>The start of a business.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome stared at the growing patch of grass in the back of<br/>the Tendo home and frowned. "This is..." he muttered under his breath.<br/>"Maybe I could..."<p>"What are you doing?" asked Akane as she approached from behind<br/>him.<p>He glanced at her and smirked, taking his eyes away from the spot<br/>in the yard. "Nothing, just training."<p>"Oh," she said as she sat down on the back porch to watch.<p>He glanced at her and smirked. "You want a job?"<p>Akane paused, looking up at him dumbly. "Huh?"<p>"I'm going to turn this security thing into a business," said the<br/>boy with a slight shrug. "I'm thinking I'll need more than just me.<br/>I've got something in mind, and if it goes as planned..."<p>Akane looked at her hands for a moment, thinking it over. She<br/>didn't remain that way long, and nodded her head. "Sure."<p>"We've got this thing at the museum right?" asked the girl as she<br/>stood up and walked up to him.<p>"That's right, so we're already establishing a reputation," said<br/>the boy with a small nod. What he was planning could be bigger though,<br/>but there was no need to discuss it just yet.<p>++++++++++<p>A short time later, both Ranma and Akane were sitting at their<br/>desks in class.<p>"Wow! Akane, is that really you and Ranma?" said Sayuri as she<br/>shoved a newspaper in front of the girl's face.<p>"Yeah," said the girl with a smirk on her face as she looked at<br/>the photo that had been printed. It showed her and Ranma standing on<br/>either side of the gemstone.<p>"That must have been so cool! Getting to go to that fancy party!"<br/>exclaimed Yuka. "So romantic! And you got to see that diamond! It's<br/>huge!"<p>Akane frowned a little at that and shook her head. "It was pretty<br/>boring actually. We didn't get to do anything at the party really,<br/>mostly we just stood around that gem, and kept people back."<p>The girls' faces fell at this, but they remained cheerful. "So,<br/>how is that going anyway? You and Ranma are engaged?"<p>Akane looked over at him for a moment. "No, not at all. Our<br/>parents want it, but we just wouldn't work out. We decided that for<br/>ourselves a while ago."<p>"But, he's so handsome!" cried Sayuri.<p>"He's kind of a jerk. Deep down he's a nice guy though, pretty<br/>smart too," said Akane with a shrug.<p>"But, why not then?" muttered Yuka as she failed to understand.<p>"We just aren't compatible," replied Akane with a small shrug. The<br/>truth was, she was beginning to wonder why she didn't like him so much<br/>when he had first arrived. He'd made it clear that there was someone<br/>else he was in love with from the start, so she decided it was best<br/>not to think about it.<p>The rest of the day went on undisturbed.<p>++++++++++<p>Hotaru blocked several light strikes from her sensei and smiled.<br/>He was still tagging her lightly from time to time, but she was doing<br/>very well under his tutelage and she knew it.<p>"All right that's enough for now," said Ranma as he began to<br/>notice her growing a little too tired.<p>"Thank you Ranma-sensei!" said the girl cheerfully as she bowed to<br/>him.<p>Ranma smirked, it had taken a few weeks to get her to practice<br/>when he wasn't there, but she caught on after a while. He knelt down<br/>beside her and smiled. "Have you been practicing your meditation?"<p>"Un!" said the girl cheerfully with a quick nod.<p>"Okay, go ahead then," he said as he sat down across from her.<p>The girl did as she was instructed, and quickly fell into a<br/>meditative state. He raised his eyebrow at this; she was doing far<br/>better in that respect than he had expected.<p>Her father walked out and smiled at them with a mug of coffee in<br/>his hands. The girl had actually started looking forward to the<br/>lessons. She had grown calmer, and wasn't nearly as shy as she used to<br/>be. "I'm really glad I allowed this."<p>++++++++++++<p>"So? Mom is coming by this weekend?" said Ranma as they strolled<br/>towards the usual bar.<p>"Yeah, Ranko's going to have to make a few appearances," said<br/>Carrot with a small nod.<p>"Man," muttered Ranma grumpily. "I hate when we have to do that."<p>"Yeah well, live and learn. She seems to like her," said Dan with<br/>a small shrug.<p>"I'm just glad I don't have to be the one doing it," muttered<br/>Ranma dejectedly.<p>"I think we can bring Jadeite back," said Carrot suddenly.<p>"Huh?" said the other three voices inside his head.<p>"I said..." said Carrot.<p>"I heard you!" snapped Dan. "What the hell are you talking about?"<p>"We can bring him back, I'm sure of it. You heard what the others<br/>said, he's not really dead. Just sort of sealed away," said Carrot<br/>calmly.<p>"So? How the hell are we supposed to do that?" snapped Ranma. It<br/>was obvious that he was very interested to hear what the boy had to<br/>say though.<p>"When I said we, I actually meant Pissant," replied Carrot. He<br/>stopped them in the middle of the sidewalk and leaned against a fence<br/>that ran along beside it.<p>"Me?" muttered the voice timidly.<p>"That's right, alone you probably couldn't do it, but when we<br/>combine our chi like we did before. That white power actually seemed<br/>stronger," said Carrot calmly.<p>"How do we get to him?" asked Dan with a small frown.<p>"We see if we can get the others to bring us to him," replied<br/>Carrot calmly.<p>"That's crazy!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Is it? They seemed pretty upset about what happened to him to<br/>me," said Dan with a small frown forming on their face.<p>"I liked him, I'd be glad to help him if I can," said Pissant<br/>cheerfully.<p>"The question is, can we get the others to help us, and trust them<br/>enough not to turn on us?" said Dan seriously.<p>"I think that we can," said Carrot calmly.<p>"How is that?" muttered Dan.<p>"We ask them," replied Carrot.<p>"Just go up and ask?" said Ranma.<p>"Sure, why not? The worst that could happen is them saying no,"<br/>said Carrot. "Then we just forget about this."<p>"Okay," said Dan with a small shrug.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Well, if it isn't Genaku," said Kunzite as he noticed the boy<br/>walk into the bar.<p>Nephrite and Zocite both nodded a greeting at him.<p>The boy smirked and calmly walked up to them. "We need a booth<br/>today."<p>"What for?" asked Zocite as he looked at his companions for a<br/>moment.<p>"Because I've got something to discuss with you," said the boy<br/>calmly.<p>The trio looked at one another again, and followed him over to a<br/>dark corner of the bar.<p>"What are you up too?" asked Nephrite suspiciously.<p>Ranma sat down, and they followed. After a moment of silence, the<br/>boy spoke up.<p>"I'm only going to offer this once. If you say no, I won't bother<br/>with it again," said the boy calmly.<p>"We aren't going to leave Beryl," snapped Kunzite angrily. The<br/>others mirrored his angry expression.<p>"Good, cause that's not what I'm asking," said the boy with a<br/>small shrug.<p>"What is it then?" muttered Zocite with a slight blush on his<br/>face.<p>"I think I can bring Jadeite back," said the boy calmly.<p>"So?" snorted Kunzite. "Beryl will just kill him again."<p>"Not if he's here with me," said Ranma calmly.<p>Zocite started to laugh. "With you? Are you mad?"<p>"No, he can lay low with me for a while, until queen bitch calms<br/>down, or you win this little war you're planning."<p>Nephrite looked at him for a moment and frowned. "You're serious?"<p>"All I need to do is find a way to get to him, and get back here<br/>with him," said the boy calmly.<p>"Why would you do this?" asked Nephrite coldly.<p>Ranma merely grinned at him. "To tell the truth, I need his help."<p>"Pardon?" said Kunzite skeptically.<p>"Did Nephrite tell you of my last meeting with him?" asked the boy<br/>calmly.<p>The trio nodded, Nephrite had a small frown on his face as he did.<p>"Well, I'm going to start a security business. I like that kind of<br/>work," said the boy with a small smirk.<p>"So you need someone older to get things moving," said Kunzite.<p>"It'll be a lot easier if I have someone older," agreed Ranma.<p>"There's a motive I can understand," said Zocite cheerfully. He<br/>looked at his companions and shrugged his shoulders. "Why not?"<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma stepped out of the dark porthole and glanced around in<br/>confusion. "Where the heck are we?"<p>"It's a storage room, mostly old junk. Weapons mostly, a lot of<br/>Mercurian technology. Mostly useless to us, these things can't harm<br/>the senshi, and magic is more effective," commented Zocite as he<br/>appeared behind him.<p>"Where's Jadeite?" said Ranma as he frowned at them.<p>"He's in the throne room. Beryl should be gone, but I think it<br/>would be a better idea to make sure before we go waltzing in there<br/>with you," said Kunzite.<p>+++++++++++<p>Several moments later, Nephrite waved them into the throne room.<br/>Jadeites dried out husk was sitting inside a large crystal off to the<br/>side of the room.<p>"How do we get him out of there?" asked Ranma coolly.<p>"Easily enough, if he's revived he should simply come out on his<br/>own," said Kunzite with a shrug.<p>"Good," muttered Ranma as he walked up the crystal and put his<br/>hands up. "I hope this works."<p>The three generals stepped back in shock as a white light blasted<br/>out from his palms. After a moment Ranma cut off the beam of energy<br/>and stepped back from the crystal.<p>"What was that?" gasped Nephrite in shock.<p>"I'm not sure, I found it by accident a few weeks ago," said Ranma<br/>as he watched the crystal. A smile slowly formed on his face as the<br/>energy did exactly what he had expected. The dead form of Jadeite, was<br/>quickly being revived. He appeared to be simply sleeping now. After a<br/>few seconds, the man fell through the outside of the crystal and<br/>slumped down on the ground, groaning painfully.<p>"What happened to me? Where am I?" he gasped. His body spasmed,<br/>and he jerked violently forward. "What?"<p>Ranma stepped back in shock as something dark and evil looking<br/>slowly rose from his back, it seemed like a dark shadow almost. It<br/>screeched at him angrily, and he blasted it with a small ball of white<br/>light, dispersing it in an instant.<p>"What was that?" gasped Nephrite in horror.<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes and frowned. "I don't know. Help me get<br/>him out of here."<p>"If we open a porthole in here, Beryl will know about it," said<br/>Kunzite calmly. "We'd do better to take him back the way we came."<p>"Did it occur to you that she might ask where he went?" said<br/>Zocite with a small frown.<p>"Blame it on me. Tell her I lied to you and said I'd join,"<br/>replied Ranma calmly. "You brought me to see her, and I escaped."<p>"That's a little far fetched," snorted Kunzite irritably.<p>"Not really, the Senshi are trying to kill me after all," said<br/>Ranma with a small shrug. "We share a common enemy, so things will<br/>probably go a little smoother if you point that out to her."<p>"We'll be punished," said Kunzite sourly.<p>"Not very harshly," noted Nephrite.<p>"In Beryl's standards, that will be quite painful," said Zocite.<p>"Relax, we'll be laughing about this in a few weeks," said Ranma<br/>irritably. This was not the time for a mutiny.<p>Kunzite and Zocite frowned at this, but helped him lift Jadeite<br/>and carry him away.<p>+++++++++++<p>"How stable is this porthole?" asked Ranma as they stood around<br/>the exit to the Dark Kingdom.<p>"What do you mean?" snapped Nephrite angrily. It was him who had<br/>made it, and he looked like he took the comment personally.<p>"No. I mean, will it take any more energy to transport more?"<p>"Not really, the energy is in creating and closing the porthole.<br/>Maintaining it is easy," said the man with a frown on his face.<p>"Where am I?" muttered Jadeite dumbly.<p>Ranma shrugged his shoulders and shoved him into the porthole. He<br/>stumbled forward and fell into it.<p>"Help me," said Ranma as he began to toss various things through<br/>the hole. Anything that wasn't nailed down really.<p>"What are you doing?" said Nephrite dumbly.<p>"Taking some of this stuff. You said it's not useful to you. I bet<br/>I can find interesting ways of using it," said the boy as he smirked<br/>at them.<p>Kunzite and Zocite shrugged their shoulders and began to toss<br/>things into the vortex.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Several minutes later, the group walked out and found a large pile<br/>of objects on top of the fallen Jadeite.<p>"Oops," said Ranma sheepishly as he dug his friend out.<p>"Where am I?" muttered Jadeite numbly.<p>"Relax, I just woke you up from a rather nasty sleep. You'll be<br/>all right in a few hours," said the pigtailed boy cheerfully.<p>"What are you going to do with all of this junk?" snorted Zocite<br/>as he kicked at some of the equipment.<p>"Some of it I'm going to sell the patents too. Others I'll use in<br/>my new business," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Well, have fun," said Kunzite with a small shrug. He and the<br/>others turned towards the porthole.<p>"Wait. I haven't thanked you yet," said Ranma as he stood up from<br/>where he was kneeling and smirked at them evilly.<p>"Huh?" said Nephrite dumbly.<p>The trio turned and saw a small multi colored ball of light<br/>swirling around in his palms. They were standing right beside one<br/>another in a tight group.<p>"Moukou Takabishi!" cried Ranma as he blasted the energy forward.<p>The Dark Generals managed to scream just before it engulfed them.<br/>The blast died down, and the vortex vanished as it came in contact<br/>with the energy bolt. After the blast cleared, the three generals were<br/>lying on the ground in a heap. Three dark shadows were hovering in the<br/>air just over them.<p>Ranma smirked and repeated his attack at them. They vanished,<br/>leaving only a few wisps of dark power behind. "Gotya!"<p>++++++++++++<p>Jadeite jumped up in shock. A terrified look on his face as he<br/>gasped for breath suddenly. "Where?" He looked down at himself and<br/>noticed he was lying in a small cot in a mostly barren room.<p>"Welcome back Jadeite," said Genaku as he smirked at him. The boy<br/>was sitting on top of a dresser and eyeing him coldly.<p>"Where am I?" asked the general.<p>"It's a hotel room, the others are here too?" said the boy calmly<br/>as he jumped up. The man glanced around and noticed the other three<br/>still sleeping on futons along the floor beside him.<p>"What's happened to me?" he muttered as he held his head for a<br/>moment and groaned painfully.<p>"Nothing much, you've been working for Beryl for a while now, and<br/>when you failed, she sealed you up rather than revive you," said the<br/>boy with a small shrug. "You're going to stay on earth for a while<br/>now."<p>"Beryl?" muttered the man in shocked horror. "I couldn't<br/>have...how could I? No! It had to be a terrible dream!"<p>"Heh. I thought so," muttered the boy as he formed a ball of white<br/>light in his hand. "This is most interesting."<p>"What did you do?" muttered Jadeite as he looked at the boy for a<br/>moment.<p>"It seems I have the ability to break Beryl's hold over you. When<br/>the other's wake up, I'm going to offer them the same choice I'm about<br/>to give you. One, you go to the closet on the right, and back to her."<p>"And the other?" said the man as he glared at the boy.<p>"You pick the other closet, and stay here with me," said Ranma<br/>with a small shrug.<p>Jadeite stood up and looked down at himself. He wasn't wearing<br/>anything but a pair of boxers. "Wha?"<p>"Make your choice Jadeite," said Ranma with a slight smirk on his<br/>face.<p>Jadeite stood up and opened the closet. He paused and stared at<br/>the contents in shock. "You're kidding right?"<p>Ranma merely chuckled and shook his head for a moment.<p>"Wait in the room next door, the others will make their own<br/>choice," said Ranma as he nodded at the door that led between the two<br/>rooms.<p>Jadeite waited about an hour before Zocite and Kunzite came<br/>through. They were wearing the same thing he was.<p>Finally, ten minutes later Nephrite walked in with Ranma behind<br/>him. All five of them were dressed exactly the same.<p>Ranma smiled and put four silver cases down in front of them. They<br/>each took one.<p>"Well. It looks like we're going to be working together again.<br/>I've decided to choose my side now. I'm making my own. Beryl will be<br/>trying too kill us, and the Senshi are still our enemies. They will<br/>try to destroy us on sight if they can. Don't bother even trying to<br/>explain things too them at the moment. We'll work out something with<br/>them later," said Genaku with a small smirk.<p>"What is this?" said Nephrite as he leaned forward and stared at<br/>Ranma.<p>"This is my security force. We're going to become highly<br/>specialized security guards. An elite force so to speak," said the boy<br/>with a small shrug. "I rented out these rooms for about two months,<br/>they'll be our base of operations." He pointed out the pile of<br/>equipment they had lifted from the supply room.<p>"We took that much?" said Kunzite in shock.<p>"Yup," said the boy cheerfully.<p>"All this for a rent a cop company?" snorted Nephrite.<p>"No. That's just a front," said Ranma as he put on his shades and<br/>dusted off his suit jacket. "We're about to become the best kept<br/>secret in the universe."<p>The four men stared at him dumbly for a moment. "Huh?"<p>"We work in secret, we have no names, we don't exist," said Ranma<br/>coldly. "Welcome to the Men In Black gentlemen." He put a few packs of<br/>business cards on the table and smiled at them.<p>"What?" said Kunzite dumbly.<p>"We're going to become the defenders of Earth once again. The<br/>senshi are not enough. They can't keep up with all these attacks that<br/>are happening. Now that Beryl has lost her generals, things are going<br/>to take a turn for the worst. She'll have to use youma to collect<br/>energy. That's where we come in. We're protecting the Earth from the<br/>scum of the universe. Just like old times."<p>The three men blinked and looked at one another for a moment. They<br/>each opened the cases they had been given. Inside was a pair of<br/>sunglasses and a business card.<p>"N?" muttered Nephrite.<p>"Z," said Zocite with a small frown.<p>"I'll bet I'm J. Yup," said Jadeite as he glanced down at his own<br/>card and smirked.<p>"That would make me K," said Kunzite.<p>"Gee I wonder what you might be Genaku," deadpanned Jadeite.<p>"R actually," said the boy with a shrug. "I go by Ranma these<br/>days, you should start calling me that. People will think it's weird<br/>if you call me Genaku."<p>Ranma walked over too the door that led outside and opened it. He<br/>stuck his head out and moved back in again.<p>"Ranma? What's going on?" said Akane as she glanced around in<br/>confusion. She was dressed in her business suit again, and had an<br/>impatient frown on her face.<p>"Sorry. This took a bit longer than expected," said Ranma<br/>sheepishly as he scratched the back of his head. "Guys, meet agent A."<p>The four men simply waved dumbly. None of them was quite sure what<br/>to do now.<p>"Ranma?" asked the girl in confusion. "What is this?"<p>"You said you wanted a job right?" said the boy with a small<br/>chuckle. "Well, this is our first day."<p>He handed her a card and she glanced at it for a moment. "Men In<br/>Black?" She looked up at him and frowned. "Men?"<p>"It sounds better than People In Black, or Men In Black and a<br/>Woman," he said with a smirk. "It's catchy and easy to remember,<br/>that's all. Don't take it personally."<p>"Who are these guys?" said the girl irritably as she eyed the four<br/>men suspiciously.<p>"Very old friends of mine, don't worry," said Ranma cheerfully as<br/>he put his shades on and smirked.<p>"This is a bit much for security guards," commented Akane.<p>"We're expensive security guards," said Ranma with a shrug. "Don't<br/>worry, we're fully funded."<p>"Funded?" said Akane in confusion.<p>"Give her the speech," said Jadeite cheerfully.<p>"Yeah, tell her," agreed Nephrite with a small chuckle.<p>"Jerks," grumbled Ranma as he flashed them a sour frown.<p>+++++++++++<p>A few hours later, Ranma sat in front of the television once<br/>again. He had a scowl on his face as he stared at the screen.<p>"Men In Black?" grumbled Dan.<p>"Shut up! It was a good movie!" snapped Carrot.<p>"This wasn't one of your brighter moments Carrot," said Dan.<p>"Man, that was stupid," grumbled Ranma.<p>"Actually, I thought it was kind of nice," said Pissant.<p>"Whatever, it'll catch on," said Carrot irritably.<p>"We've decided to be against them both then?" said Dan with a<br/>small sigh.<p>"They're both trying to kill us, so why not?" snorted Carrot<br/>angrily.<p>"I don't want to fight with the Senshi," grumbled Ranma.<p>"We don't have much choice. They aren't exactly asking us about<br/>ourselves before they attack," snorted Carrot.<p>"I've got to admit, using the security agency as a front was a<br/>good idea," said Dan with a small sigh.<p>"What do you think Akane thinks of all this?" asked Carrot.<p>"We're still keeping a lot of secrets from her," said Dan with a<br/>small shrug. "We should continue to do so. Some of this is a little<br/>too far fetched."<p>"More far fetched than protecting the planet from a bunch of<br/>invading monsters? With four magically powered warriors, and a whole<br/>bunch of advanced technology that we managed to get our hands on<br/>somehow?" asked Carrot.<p>"Yes," said Dan calmly. "We'll let her in on more when she needs<br/>to know. It will probably never come up."<p>"Here's hoping," said Carrot with a heavy sigh.<p>+++++++++++<p>Akane was lying on her bed and staring at the card. It was a bit<br/>much, invading monsters and the Sailor Senshi? If it wasn't that weird<br/>boy who had walked into her life a few months ago, she'd never believe<br/>it. Still, it surprised her that he'd invited her into something like<br/>this at all. She wasn't nearly as good as he was at martial arts, and<br/>she'd felt more like a sidekick recently.<p>Still, she'd always wanted some sort of adventure in her life.<br/>Something real, where she could actually use her skills for something<br/>more meaningful than beating up hormone driven perverts at school.<p>She flipped over onto her back, looking at the card for a long<br/>time.<p>"I guess I'm in," she muttered with a sigh.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Setsuna stood up for the first time in weeks, the green goo that<br/>had once surrounded her entire body was now dripping from her naked<br/>form as she stepped out of the healing chamber at last. She had a cold<br/>scowl on her face as she grabbed a towel that had been set up for her<br/>and wrapped it around her body.<p>"Tsuki. Come here," she said quietly.<p>The girl was in front of her in an instant. "You called me?" She<br/>bowed her head slightly as she said this.<p>"Yes, you have done well, despite a few mishaps. I am proud of<br/>you, but you are not yet ready." Setsuna held out her hand, and the<br/>girl placed the Time Staff in her hand.<p>"That was harder than I'd thought it would be," grumbled the girl<br/>with a small frown.<p>"Like all things, it grows easier with time. You have plenty of<br/>time child," said the woman with a slight smirk on her face.<p>"Yes Mistress," muttered the girl as she perked up and sat down in<br/>one of the chairs in the room.<p>Pluto walked towards the time gates and frowned. The image of<br/>Crystal Tokyo was flickering. "This is not good. It seems I have a lot<br/>of work to do yet." She snarled and glared into the gates a little<br/>harder. "Genaku, I know it is him who is causing this. This time, I'll<br/>destroy him for sure. Nothing will stop me, and I will ensure the<br/>future of Crystal Tokyo at any cost."<p>Tsuki watched the scene calmly, a rather bored expression on her<br/>face. She used to think it was scary at first, but she soon learned<br/>that the woman was almost always like that when she watched the stream<br/>of time flow through the gates. The snarling angrily was a bit new<br/>though.<p>"Oh well," she said with a small shrug.<p>++++++++<p>Meanwhile, on yet another plane...<p>"Nephrite! Before me!" bellowed Beryl angrily. "Kunzite! Zocite!<br/>Where are you! If you do not appear before me, I shall destroy you<br/>all!" She seethed in anger as no response came.<p>"Where are those imbeciles?" she paused and noticed something off<br/>to the side of the throne room.<p>"Where is Jadeite?" she said coldly as she strolled over to the<br/>empty crystal.<p>Taped to the front of the crystal, was a small note.<p>"Dear Beryl, we quit. Signed, Your Generals."<p>She growled angrily and shook with rage. "This isn't possible!<br/>How? They shouldn't be able to break my will! It's not possible!"<p>That was when she noticed a small side note at the bottom of the<br/>page.<p>"Hiya! Borrowing your generals for a while! Genaku McTome!" There<br/>was a small face with its tongue sticking out at her drawn in the<br/>corner.<p>She lifted her hands in the air and screamed in rage.<p>++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: A new threat in Nerima?<p>Why you might ask?<p>I decided I liked having the genrals around, and I didn't want to<br/>kill them off. That's all really.<p>
