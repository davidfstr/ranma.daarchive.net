</div>Insertion<p>Part 18<p>Back to reality.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma smirked as he strolled into the schoolyard of Furinkan; it<br/>was a relatively normal day for the most part. The evening before was<br/>an interesting one, but things quickly reverted back to dull normality<br/>once he'd returned to the dojo.<p>"What are you so happy about?" said Akane as she noticed his grin.<p>"You'd probably get mad at me if you knew," he replied with a<br/>shrug.<p>The girl blinked and frowned at him. "What's that mean?"<p>"Secret," he replied as he continued walking.<p>"Hold villain!" said Kuno as he appeared from around his usual<br/>spot behind the large tree in the courtyard.<p>"Heya Kuno," said the boy casually as he raised his hand in<br/>greeting.<p>"Disgusting cur! I shall free Akane Tendo from your grasp at<br/>last!"<p>"Right, free her, got ya," said the boy as he continued to walk<br/>away.<p>"Stand and fight!" snarled Kuno as he watched the boy pass him.<p>"Naw, not today," said Ranma as he continued towards the doors.<p>"Very well coward! I see that you run away from my prowess!"<br/>called Kuno angrily.<p>"Yeah, run away, right," said the boy as he walked through the<br/>doors and left him standing in the schoolyard.<p>Akane watched the scene in confusion, not saying a single word.<br/>"Wait a minute, you mean...that's it?" she thought to herself.<p>"Akane Tendo! I would face you then!" said Kuno as he turned too<br/>look at her.<p>The girl looked at him and shrugged her shoulders. "Maybe later."<p>"What?" said Kuno dumbly.<p>"I don't feel like it," she said as she continued to walk away<br/>from him.<p>"I cannot permit this! How can I prove my love to you without<br/>honorable combat?" snapped the boy as he ran in front of her and took<br/>up a combat stance.<p>Akane looked up at him and noticed something. He looked like he<br/>was having a panic attack. "I dunno." She continued to walk past him<br/>towards the school, leaving him standing in his ready pose.<p>"But...but...I..." stuttered Kuno dumbly. A wind blew across the<br/>courtyard, blowing a small dust cloud up at his feet. "How...I<br/>must...Akane Tendo...I...my love...surely I must..."<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma glanced out the window about half way through his first<br/>period and sighed. "Man, how long is he going to stand there?" Kuno<br/>was still in the courtyard, standing dumbly in his combat pose and<br/>muttering to himself.<p>Akane was simply staring at the wall in front of her with a blush<br/>on her cheeks.<p>Ranma turned and noticed this. "What's wrong with you?"<p>"Mr. Saotome! Is there a problem?" snapped the teacher.<p>"Um, yeah. Akane and Kuno are acting weird," said the boy as he<br/>looked up at the man. "What's up Akane? You're actin funny today?"<p>The teacher stared at him for a moment, not expecting an answer.<br/>Students usually just looked embarrassed and muttered to themselves<br/>before becoming quiet.<p>Everyone in the room was looking at Akane now, and her blushed<br/>deepened.<p>"You mean...after all this time. All I had to do was just walk<br/>away from him?"<p>Ranma smirked and nodded his head. "Pretty much."<p>"But...All I had to do was walk away?" she cried in shock.<p>"Come on, don't take it so hard," said Ranma as he pat her<br/>shoulder.<p>"I can't believe this!" snapped the girl in frustration.<p>+++++++++++<p>Outside, Kuno finally seemed to understand what had happened to<br/>him. "Can it be? Akane Tendo has finally realized her love for me, and<br/>cannot bring herself to harm me any longer? Oh! Weep for joy Akane<br/>Tendo, for I am coming into your arms at last!" He rushed towards the<br/>building with his arms spread wide.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma noticed this and turned towards Akane, "Hey, you got<br/>incoming."<p>"Huh?" muttered the girl as she blinked at him.<p>"Akane Tendo! At last you have discovered your love!" cried Kuno<br/>as he burst into the room.<p>"I what?" she said in disgust.<p>"Why else could you not bring yourself to harm my noble personage?<br/>Truly you have discovered the deep feelings within the depths of your<br/>heart."<p>Akane was gripping her desk in frustration. "I'm going to hurt<br/>him."<p>"I've got a better idea," said Ranma with a smirk on his face.<p>Akane looked at him for a moment and he handed her a sheet of<br/>paper. "Read this when he grabs you."<p>The girl blinked and took it from him, by that time, Kuno had<br/>rushed up and took her into his arms. "At last we can finally share<br/>our love! Come, let us leave this place and date!"<p>"Um, excuse me..." said the Teacher.<p>Akane's eyes went wide as she looked at the page in her hand.<br/>"What? This is..." She felt Kuno squeeze her a little tighter, and his<br/>hand move a little lower. A dark smile formed on her lips as she<br/>seemed to catch on.<p>Kuno blinked as she slapped him across his face. "Wha?"<p>"EEEEEK! Pervert! Get your hands off me! Help! I'm being<br/>accosted!"<p>"But my love!" stammered the boy dumbly. This had never happened<br/>before. He released her and stepped back with a horrified look on his<br/>face.<p>"Sensei! He grabbed my...my...wahhhhhhh!" cried Akane as she<br/>pointed at the boy and burst into tears.<p>Every student in the room was staring at Kuno now. Shocked<br/>expressions on their faces.<p>"But, I merely wished to convey my feelings of..."<p>"What was that thing poking me?" screeched Akane as she rubbed at<br/>her stomach.<p>"I uhhh..." stuttered Kuno as he began to blush.<p>"Oh my god! I feel so violated! So dirty!" cried the girl as she<br/>burst into tears. "Wahhhh! I'll never be clean again!"<p>Kuno began to realize that there were other people in the room,<br/>half of them were female and glared at him hatefully.<p>Ranma was watching the scene in a kind of shock. He never knew the<br/>girl had it in her, it was complete improvisation now.<p>"Don't worry Akane, we won't let that pervert touch you again,"<br/>said one of the girls in the room as she knelt down beside Akane and<br/>tried to comfort her. Akane turned and cried into her shoulder.<p>The rest of the girls had begun to throw things at Kuno. "Get out<br/>of here you pervert!"<p>"But...I..."<p>"I'd run if I were you," said Ranma as he looked up at him for a<br/>moment.<p>Kuno's eyes rolled into his head and he passed out.<p>"Guess the shame was too much for him," commented Ranma as he<br/>stood up and kicked him lightly in the ribs.<p>"Mr. Saotome, would you be so kind as to take Mr. Kuno to the<br/>nurse's station," said the Teacher as he finally sat down and gave up.<p>The boy looked up at him and nodded. "Sure. Come on pervert,<br/>before you get yourself killed."<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma sat in the dojo a few hours later. He was simply standing<br/>with his aura burning around him in silence.<p>"What exactly are we doing?" said Ranma.<p>Carrot sighed and tried to explain it again. "Well, our Kaio Ken<br/>is nothing more than more than one of us attacking at once. Right?"<p>"Pretty much," said Dan grumpily.<p>"So, obviously something happens when we synchronize like that, I<br/>want to try and dig a little deeper. It's hard to do the Kaio Ken, our<br/>timing has to be perfect to get it to work."<p>"So you want to find an easier way," said Ranma with a small nod.<p>"Right, our powers combined are easily beating the Senshi as it<br/>is, but if we could find a way to do it in more than just quick<br/>spurts, we'd have a clear advantage. As it is now, we could screw up<br/>and take a few hits real easy."<p>"I won't be a part of this," snorted Pissant.<p>"Did I ask for your help?" said Carrot irritably.<p>"Well, no but..."<p>"Then shut up," said Dan.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Akane walked into the dojo and blinked when she saw Ranma standing<br/>in the middle of the room. "What are you doing?" She stepped back in<br/>slight surprise as she realized how large the aura surrounding him<br/>was.<p>He paused and looked at her for a moment. "Huh? Nothing, just<br/>trying to develop a new technique."<p>"Oh. How is it going?" she said cheerfully.<p>"Not very well, it's harder than I thought it'd be," he replied<br/>with a small shrug.<p>"Okay," she said as she walked over to another area of the room.<p>"We're going to the office today," said Ranma as he glanced at her<br/>as she started her kata.<p>"Huh? Now?"<p>"No, finish your work out and get dressed first, no real hurry,"<br/>he said as he walked out of the room.<p>She nodded and continued to train.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Hello Ranma," said Nabiki as she walked by him on his way back to<br/>the house.<p>"Hey, how ya doin?" he said cheerfully.<p>She narrowed her eyes at him as he passed. As much fun as he was<br/>to have around, her cash flow had been strained over the past few<br/>months. "I've got to do something about him." She continued on her<br/>way, scheming against him as she walked.<p>"Boy, I want to talk with you," said Genma as he noticed his son<br/>walking by.<p>"Huh? What's up?" replied Ranma as he sat down. He noticed that he<br/>was alone with the man.<p>"Where have you been going lately. I checked, and you aren't<br/>working for that old woman any longer."<p>"Naw, I got another job," said the boy with a small shrug.<p>"Oh?"<p>"Yeah, we're working for a security company now," said Ranma<br/>cheerfully. "Akane's doing it too."<p>"Really?" said Genma with a frown on his face. "You've been<br/>neglecting your training."<p>"I'm better than you'll ever be," replied Ranma calmly.<p>"What? You'd better learn your limits boy! I..." Genma was on his<br/>feet, and Ranma appeared behind him before he could move.<p>"You're blowing steam old man. I could destroy you without<br/>breaking a sweat. There's more to this than you realize. The four of<br/>us are more than you can handle."<p>"Four?" muttered Genma in surprise.<p>"That's right," said Ranma coldly. "Look, we've got our own life<br/>to lead, just sit around and be comfortable for a while. I'm none of<br/>your concern."<p>"What? Ranma has responsibilities! You can't just..."<p>"Can't I?" said the boy with his smirk growing wider. "Who's going<br/>to stop me? You?"<p>Genma growled and sat down again, Ranma followed suit and smirked<br/>at him again.<p>"Where is all this money you've been making going?" he said<br/>calmly. "I feel I have the right to know what my son has been doing."<p>"It's where you can't get your hands on it," replied the boy<br/>calmly. "In a bank account, that isn't in his name."<p>"What?" said Genma. "Do you really think I would..."<p>"No, I know you would," replied Ranma coolly. "An old friend of<br/>mine is helping us out. Trust me old man, this is well beyond your<br/>tiny little brain."<p>Genma growled at them for a moment. "You are shaming my family."<p>"And why not? You were doing such a good job before I came along,<br/>so I figured it wouldn't hurt to help out a bit. Excuse me, we have to<br/>go now." Ranma stood up and walked away.<p>++++++++++<p>"Ready?" asked Ranma as he put on his shades. He and Akane were<br/>both dressed in their suits.<p>"Sure, how far away is it?" she asked.<p>"On the other side of Tokyo," he replied with a shrug.<p>"How are we getting there?" she said with a slightly weary frown.<p>"Nephrite, bring us in would ya?" said Ranma as he pressed the<br/>button on the side of his watch.<p>"Sure thing boss," said the man from the other side.<p>"Huh?" said Akane.<p>++++++++++++<p>"AAAAAAAAAAAaaaa..." Akane gasped for breath as she finished<br/>screaming. Ranma calmly stepped off the teleporter and waved at the<br/>man behind the controls.<p>She stumbled after him with shock in her eyes. "What? What the<br/>hell was that? How did?"<p>"It's just a teleporter, Akane," said the boy as he took off his<br/>shades and glanced around. It looked like a real office now, most of<br/>the desks were made of glass and black wood, and several people could<br/>be seen moving through a few of them. The glass on the teleporter room<br/>was darkly tinted and they were in a restricted area of the complex<br/>though. There was a rather unusual lock on the door as well. "Get her<br/>cleared for the restricted area would you?"<p>"Right," said Nephrite cheerfully. "This way please."<p>"Wha? What the hell is this?" she muttered as he led her away.<p>"This is where you work," said the man with a small shrug. "Come<br/>on. You know Jadeite and Kuzite right?"<p>She nodded as the door opened and the two men stood in front of<br/>her.<p>"This place is looking pretty good," said Ranma with a smirk on<br/>his face as he watched the other half of the office bustle around.<p>"Yes, we hired a few dozen employees for the cover business.<br/>They're actually working out quite well. We're making money," said<br/>Zocite. "This is your office."<p>"Hey, nice," said Ranma cheerfully as he looked around. It was a<br/>large room with a desk like all the others. One of the Mercury<br/>computers was set up on the desk as well.<p>"I'll introduce you to the rest of the staff later. Come on," said<br/>the man as he led him into another room.<p>There was a large screen set up in the next room. It showed a map<br/>of Tokyo and various readouts. "Everything is stable at the moment,"<br/>said Kunzite as he entered with Akane at his side.<p>"Ranma, what the hell is this?" stammered the girl in shock.<p>"I already told you, Akane," he replied with a smirk on his face.<p>"That was a joke right?" she said nervously.<p>"I'm afraid not," he said cheerfully. "Come on. Try to pull<br/>yourself together."<p>She nodded and straightened herself up as she rubbed her arm.<br/>"That hurt."<p>"It's just a blood sample Akane. We need your DNA for the security<br/>in this area. You're cleared the same as me and the guys," said Ranma<br/>with a smirk on his face.<p>"Still," she muttered dejectedly.<p>Ranma turned towards Kunzite and smirked. "Put em up would you?"<p>The man nodded and turned towards the console. Five girls appeared<br/>in various screens along the sides of the map. Each of them was doing<br/>different things. A girl meditating in front of a flame, a girl eating<br/>a large meal with her family, a girl in the kitchen, a girl studying<br/>in her room quietly, and a girl flirting with a boy at a store in the<br/>mall.<p>"What? You're spying on these girls? You perverts!" snapped Akane.<p>"These are the Sailor Senshi, we're just keeping an eye on them<br/>for security reasons. We don't record them changing or anything like<br/>that. It's just so we know where they are," said Ranma as he glanced<br/>at her.<p>"The Senshi?" muttered Akane dumbly.<p>"Yeah," said Ranma cheerfully. "Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and<br/>Moon," he said as he pointed each one out to her. "They don't like us<br/>much."<p>"What? Why?" said Akane in shock.<p>"I'm still not sure about me, it has something to do with a past<br/>life I think. These gentlemen used to work for the source of those<br/>monsters they fight all the time. Now they work for me."<p>Akane said nothing as she stared at him in shock. "But..."<p>"Relax, we don't want to kill them, but we do have to fight them<br/>off on occasion," said Ranma with a light smile on his face. "It<br/>hasn't really been a problem so far."<p>"Oh," said Akane as she hung her head and turned towards him<br/>again. "Why are we doing this?"<p>"Simple. I've learned that I had a past life a few thousand years<br/>ago. I fought beside these men to defend the Earth. We just changed<br/>the image a bit, and picked up where we left off really."<p>"That's crazy!" said Akane. She looked around for a moment and<br/>hung her head. "Never mind."<p>"Right, come on. I'll show you the armory," said Ranma as he<br/>motioned for her to follow.<p>+++++++++++<p>"What is this place?" she muttered as she looked at the rows and<br/>rows of weapons lining the walls.<p>"Weapons, guns, things like that. We've got alternative methods of<br/>fighting the Senshi and Youma, you however..."<p>"Huh?" said the girl as she looked at him and blinked.<p>"I want you to start carrying this," he said as he handed her a<br/>tiny looking weapon from one of the walls.<p>"What the hell is this?" she snapped as she took the weapon<br/>between two fingers.<p>"Noisy Cricket. It's easy for you to hide," replied the boy with a<br/>small shrug. "Don't worry, none of these weapons can actually kill the<br/>senshi. They were actually designed that way."<p>"I feel like I'm gonna break this thing!" snorted Akane in<br/>disgust.<p>"Don't worry, you won't," replied the boy as he calmly walked<br/>away.<p>"There's a few rules you have to follow from now on," said Ranma<br/>as he handed her a small book. "No one knows you work for anything<br/>more than a security company. I mean no one, not Nabiki, not your<br/>father, not my father. Break the rules and lose your memory," said<br/>Ranma as he walked along. "You're a high ranking officer in the<br/>company, but you follow our orders. You don't have much experience in<br/>this sort of thing. I feel we could use you though."<p>Akane nodded as she pocketed the book. "You work in secret, we<br/>don't exist, you don't fire your weapon in view of the public,<br/>especially in your civilian identity. You get the idea, it's not that<br/>hard."<p>She nodded at this and he handed her a small silver case. "Wear<br/>these, and keep em with you from now on."<p>She popped the case open and looked at the sunglasses for a<br/>moment. "These are...sunglasses?"<p>Ranma took them from her. "More than that, they're highly durable,<br/>nearly impossible to break. This switch here activates the cloaking<br/>device. It hides your true identity, and scrambles all know forms of<br/>recording. The generic suits help with the technology, but the glasses<br/>alone should be enough in a pinch."<p>"Um, right," muttered the girl as she put them on.<p>"Turn on your glasses and put them on, they make us look older,"<br/>said Ranma calmly.<p>Akane did so and frowned as she noticed her reflection. She did<br/>look older, but more than just the maturity of her clothes. She looked<br/>about five years older.<p>"Time to go meet the employees," said Ranma as he opened a large<br/>metal door.<p>Akane looked around and gasped. The room was really nothing more<br/>than an office with about a dozen people wandering around the various<br/>cubicles. She hadn't noticed it before.<p>"Good morning, can I help you?" said the woman at the receptionist<br/>desk who turned to see them.<p>"Good morning. I'm agent R, and this is Agent A. We're just<br/>stopping by to check up on my company," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Hikaru Gosunkugi sniffled pathetically on is bed, a large shiner<br/>present on his eye. "Stupid bullies. Why can't they leave me alone?"<br/>He continued to sob into his pillow and sat up with an angry frown on<br/>his face. "I wish I could...teach them a lesson. I wish Akane would<br/>notice me, if I was going out with her I bet no one would bother me.<br/>Heck, I just wish I had friends." He rolled onto his back and sniffled<br/>again.<p>After a moment he seemed to remember something. He sat up and<br/>looked at his closet for a moment. "Wait a minute..."<p>The mask was sitting on the floor, just outside the door.<p>"I know I put that inside there," he muttered fearfully. He jumped<br/>up and walked over to it, lifting it into his hands. "What is this<br/>thing anyway? Is it alive...or..." His eyes caught the strange shining<br/>inside and he slowly lifted it towards his face. "What's the worst<br/>that could happen?" he muttered to himself.<p>++++++++++++<p>A skinny man with long red hair stood in front of Beryl's throne.<br/>He bowed to her slightly and smiled as he held up a crystal full of<br/>life energy. His clothes were bright red, but the uniform was the same<br/>as the generals before him. "I have brought more power for Metallia."<p>"Excellent," said Beryl coldly as she raised her hand. The crystal<br/>floated into her grasp and she smiled at the thing for a moment.<br/>"Continue your duty."<p>"When do we get to destroy the Senshi and those traitors? I'm<br/>getting impatient," said the blue clad general. He was more firmly<br/>built, with a shock of spiky blue hair on his head.<p>"Indeed, this game grows boring," agreed the blond woman who<br/>walked up behind him.<p>A small boy followed them in, he looked no older than seven. His<br/>clothes and hair were black. "They're right you know, we aren't short<br/>on energy any longer."<p>"I want to be overstocked," replied Beryl calmly. "Those brats<br/>grow more troublesome each time we encounter them, and the former<br/>generals are quite resourceful. If they have loosened my control from<br/>their minds, they will be much more cunning than the drones they ended<br/>up as."<p>"It sounds interesting," said the red general with a smirk on his<br/>face.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Report," said Pluto calmly as Tsuki walked into the room. She was<br/>sitting behind a desk with a large book in front of her.<p>"They don't seem to be interested in Genaku much. He's still too<br/>much for them to handle at the moment," replied the girl with a small<br/>shrug. "They seem to have accepted it."<p>"Good, we don't want them getting themselves killed," said Pluto<br/>with a short nod.<p>Tsuki furrowed her brow slightly as she sat down. "They also think<br/>that I'm gay."<p>"It cannot be helped," said Setsuna calmly.<p>"I never said I wasn't," replied the girl casually.<p>"That is not important to me child," said Setsuna as she stood up.<p>"You were right though, playing clumsy and acting like a ditz did<br/>make them trust me," said the girl with a smirk on her face.<p>"Who said you were playing?" retorted Pluto with a slight smirk.<p>"Okay. So? Even I'm not that clumsy," retorted Tsuki bitterly. "No<br/>one has that much luck, killing a youma by accident. It's ridiculous."<p>"You'll grow out of it, Serenity was much like both you and Usagi.<br/>She was a terrible klutz until she matured fully. Something to do with<br/>growth spurts."<p>"I feel bad about spying on them this way," said Tsuki with a<br/>small frown on her face.<p>"It is for their own good, and you aren't betraying them," replied<br/>Pluto calmly.<p>"I'm going to bed then," said Tsuki as she turned away. She<br/>promptly walked into the door. After a moment of lying on the ground,<br/>she stood up and sheepishly rubbed at her forehead. "Oops, forgot I<br/>closed that."<p>Pluto sighed and glanced up at her for a moment as she left the<br/>room. "At least, I hope she grows out of it." She put down the book<br/>she had been pretending to read and walked over to the time gate with<br/>a worried frown. The Negaverse had gone silent. She couldn't see<br/>anything pertaining to the future involving them. "This is not good,"<br/>she muttered under her breath. Far into the future, Crystal Tokyo<br/>still flickered in and out of existence, as if it was dangerously<br/>close to vanishing forever.<p>Once again, her headache was growing worse.<p>+++++++++++<p>Nephrite turned towards Ranma and frowned. He and Akane had just<br/>returned to the back rooms after looking the place over.<p>"What's up?" said the boy as he took off his shades.<p>"A strange energy from somewhere in Nerima," said Zocite as he<br/>pointed at the display screen. A small green light had appeared and<br/>was moving excitedly down the street.<p>"Can we get a visual?" said Ranma as he moved up next to the man.<p>"No, it's too fast to track," said Zocite.<p>Ranma glanced up and noticed that the green dot was bouncing<br/>wildly across the streets of Nerima. "A youma?"<p>"Doesn't fit the energy signature," said Kunzite as he pointed out<br/>the color. "It's green, unless Beryl found something new, it should be<br/>red for a youma."<p>"It's moving towards Juban though," said Nephrite with a sour<br/>frown.<p>"It's stopping!" said Kunzite as he saw the green dot freeze<br/>suddenly.<p>"Well, let's go say hi then," said Ranma with a smirk on his face.<p>"What's going on?" said Akane nervously.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Ranma appeared in the street with Akane beside him. "Should be in<br/>there," he said as he pointed at a small home.<p>"Give me your lunch money!" cried a booming voice as the door<br/>exploded outward. A rough looking boy in his early teens rushed out<br/>the door on his hands and knees, he appeared to have a book bag shoved<br/>up his ass.<p>"No! Please!" whimpered the boy.<p>The thing that followed him out was like something out of a<br/>cartoon. It had on a long black cape with a collar that rose above its<br/>head. The clothing was mostly black, and looked like something out of<br/>a fantasy novel. Leather boots and a loose shirt. It had a mallet over<br/>its head and glared down at the unfortunate boy with a wicked grin on<br/>its face. Its head was nothing but a gigantic green face with wild<br/>eyes.<p>"What the hell is that?" said Akane in shock.<p>Ranma just chuckled. "Remember that mask we were guarding in the<br/>museum?"<p>She turned her head and nodded silently.<p>"I told you it was cursed right? Well, you're looking at the curse<br/>right now."<p>The thing looked at the pair for a moment and blinked. "Who? Well,<br/>helloooo!" It rushed up to Akane and took her into its arms. "Mon ami!<br/>I feel the passion, we were meant to be together cheri!"<p>Akane promptly flipped the thing over her shoulder and laid it out<br/>across the pavement. She stepped back in shocked horror as its body<br/>flattened out across the pavement in an impossible manner.<p>Ranma calmly pulled his blaster from his jacket and pointed it at<br/>the thing. "Who are you?"<p>The thing pulled itself off the ground and shook its head until<br/>its body reformed. "Huh? Who am I? I'm..." It seemed to ponder the<br/>question for a moment. It seemed to have a thought and posed proudly,<br/>pointing its finger into the air. "I am! Okii Atama!"<p>"Big head?" muttered Akane lamely.<p>"That's nice," said Ranma as he shot the thing in the chest.<p>Okii Atama was thrown off of his feet and laid out across the<br/>ground.<p>"You saved me!" cried the boy who was clutching Ranma's leg with<br/>tears in his eyes. He looked down at him and kicked him off. The boy<br/>was sprawled out across the pavement. Ranma reached down and pulled<br/>the bag out of his ass with a quick jerk, causing the boy to scream in<br/>pain.<p>"You killed it!" said Akane in horror as she stared down at the<br/>thing.<p>"It's not dead," said Ranma calmly. He pulled his neuralizer out<br/>of his coat and looked at the thing's victim for a moment. He put on<br/>his shades and smiled at him. "Don't worry, you won't feel a thing?"<p>"What?" said the boy in horror. The light flashed, erasing his<br/>memory and leaving him sitting dumbly.<p>"You fell out of your window and landed on a rake in the back<br/>yard. That's how you injured yourself, now go inside and tell your<br/>parents so they can get you to a hospital before you bleed to death."<p>The boy nodded and started to crawl away, the pain too much for<br/>him to even stand properly.<p>"Now, back to you. Hand over that mask kid. I don't know who you<br/>are, but I can't have that thing running around causing trouble. I'm<br/>sure the rightful owners would like to have it back."<p>"He's not moving," said Akane nervously.<p>Ranma stepped forward and stomped on the thing's crotch. It sat up<br/>and screamed in pain, its eyes bugged out of its skull and its tongue<br/>rolled out across the pavement.<p>"Ouch! That hurt you know!" squeaked the thing in a high pitched<br/>voice.<p>"Give me that mask," said Ranma coldly.<p>The thing pulled its face off, revealing a skull underneath its<br/>skin. He handed his face over to Ranma and grinned. "Here you go."<p>"Funny," said the boy calmly as he handed it back. "You're making<br/>a mess out of the pavement though.<p>The thing looked down and noticed he was still bleeding all over<br/>the ground. "Oh my, that won't do at all." It spun around and appeared<br/>dressed in a janitor's uniform and began to mop up the street. "There,<br/>all clean!" The area on the ground now sparkled.<p>Ranma frowned and pointed his blaster at the thing's head. "Give<br/>me that mask, or I'll blow it off your face."<p>The thing suddenly became angry. "You think you can threaten me?"<p>Ranma narrowed his eyes and nodded.<p>"Um, Ranma..." muttered Akane as she backed away from the pair.<p>"Take this!" cried the thing as a dark power started to form in<br/>its hands. It crackled angrily between its palms and began to tear up<br/>sections of the street.<p>"What the?" muttered Ranma as he stepped back in shock.<p>"Devoid Matter Spell!" cried the thing as it thrust its hands<br/>forward.<p>Ranma tensed to jump away, but paused when he found himself<br/>standing in the middle of a shower of playing cards that was shooting<br/>from the thing's hands.<p>It paused and looked down at the spell for a moment. "Hmm, needs<br/>work." It laughed madly and bolted down the street.<p>Ranma growled and put his weapon back inside his coat as he<br/>watched it go. There was no way he could catch it at the speed it was<br/>moving.<p>"Where is it going?" he said into the watch.<p>"It's vanished," said Nephrite from the other end.<p>"Come on, we're going back," said Ranma as he turned towards Akane<br/>and frowned.<p>"Um, right," muttered the girl. "What the hell did I get myself<br/>into?" she said to herself as the light swallowed them up.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC... Next time: Attack of the Youma Lords!
