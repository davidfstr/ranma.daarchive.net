</div>Insertion<p>Part 9<p>Cologne's trick.<p>+++++++++++<p>"What's wrong?" said Kasumi as she looked down at Ranma for a<br/>moment in shock.<p>"The water! That old hag!" snarled the girl angrily. She was<br/>currently in the nude, and looking at the luke-warm furo hatefully.<p>"What the heck are you talking about?" said Akane as she strolled<br/>in with Nabiki.<p>"That old bat! She hit me with some shiatsu that makes my body<br/>overly sensitive! I can't change back into a boy!" said Ranma as she<br/>stood up and glared at the water.<p>"Old woman?" said Nabiki in confusion.<p>"What are you talking about, you idiot?" snapped Akane.<p>Ranma merely walked out of the bathroom, grabbing her clean<br/>clothes as she went.<br/>"I've got to go see someone. I don't know when I'll be back."<p>"That was weird," commented Nabiki as she watched him go.<p>"Oh my," muttered Kasumi.<p>"He's up to something, I can smell it," said Akane.<p>"You've been saying that since he got here," pointed out Nabiki.<p>"So?" muttered the girl in embarrassment.<p>"I'm going after him," said Nabiki as she rushed out of the room.<p>+++++++++++<p>"You don't mean my little 'Full Body Cat's Tongue' do you?"<br/>chuckled Cologne as she looked the angry Ranma in the face.<p>"Yeah, that one," replied the redhead.<p>"I could give you the cure, if you promise to come back with my<br/>Shampoo," said the old woman with a crafty looking chuckle.<p>"Or, I could trade it for her life," said Ranma casually as she<br/>leaned against the counter and looked at her fingernails for a moment.<p>"You couldn't," muttered Cologne.<p>"You know I could," replied the pigtailed girl lazily. "I'm<br/>willing to be reasonable. How about I work for it?"<p>"What's that?" said the old woman.<p>"I'm willing to work out some kind of agreement, or challenge.<br/>Something reasonable of course," said the pigtailed girl calmly. "You<br/>can take my offer, or I'll just make Shampoo disappear for a while."<p>"And how do you plan to do that?" said Cologne cautiously.<p>"That would be telling wouldn't it?" said the redhead with a<br/>smirk. "Come on, let's work something out."<p>"Very well," conceded the old woman after a moment of thought. Her<br/>smile had turned rather cheerful. "I just opened my business, and I am<br/>in need of a server to wait tables. If I should happen to drop this in<br/>the course of the day..." She held up a large ball attached to a<br/>necklace.<p>"What's that thing?" said Ranma as she looked at it.<p>"It is called the Phoenix Pill, and it is the cure for your<br/>condition," said Cologne cheerfully.<p>"You got a deal," said Ranma with a smirk on her face.<p>"Great Grandmother, Shampoo..." the young amazon walked out of the<br/>kitchen with a confused frown on her face. It quickly changed into a<br/>mask of anger as she noticed the girl standing with the old woman.<br/>"Ranma! I kill!"<p>"Huh? You mean, you didn't...?" The girl looked at Cologne for a<br/>moment and sighed as the old woman simply shook her head negative.<br/>"Great," said the girl with a smirk on her face as she dashed out of<br/>the room, with Shampoo in hot pursuit.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Well, now what?" said Carrot as he stepped out of the alleyway<br/>they had ducked into and watched the amazon girl fade into the<br/>distance.<p>"What the heck are we doing? Why don't we just take that stupid<br/>pill?" snapped Ranma angrily.<p>"I don't see any point in dragging this out," said Dan irritably.<p>"We're going to need this speed training, that's why," said Carrot<br/>calmly.<p>"Speed training?" muttered Ranma in confusion.<p>"That's right, taking that pill away from that old woman isn't<br/>going to be as easy as you think. Dan and I aren't going to help you<br/>either," said Carrot.<p>"What? You jerks!"<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" snarled Dan as he grabbed<br/>them by their neck and pushed them against the wall.<p>Carrot merely smirked. "If Ranma trains in the Chestnut Fist, then<br/>we'll all be much faster. We can take the pill from her working<br/>together, but if the body is trained, think about what we can do<br/>then."<p>"Chestnut Fist?" said Ranma in confusion.<p>"I think I get it," said Dan reluctantly as he released them from<br/>his grip.<p>"It's agreed then, we play along for a while, and then show this<br/>old bat what we're made of," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"Right," agreed the other two, although Ranma had no idea what he<br/>was agreeing too.<p>++++++++++++<p>Nabiki frowned as she saw Ranma nodding too himself like he did<br/>sometimes. Her eyebrow raised slightly when she saw him grab himself<br/>by the neck and push himself up against a nearby wall. It hadn't been<br/>hard to follow him after he left the restaurant and talked with that<br/>old woman. The Chinese girl left a rather messy trail behind her.<p>"Who the heck are these people? What do they have to do with<br/>Ranma?" she muttered under her breath. She had heard some of the<br/>conversation between Ranma and that old crone, and knew that the girl<br/>had gotten a part time job for some reason. "I can use that, I'm<br/>betting more than a few boys will pay good money to hear about a new<br/>restaurant with that kind of waitress." She chuckled and faded away.<p>+++++++++++<p>"You what?" said Cologne as she looked at the redhead in shock.<p>"I put these up," said Ranma cheerfully as she looked down at her<br/>new boss.<p>"Well, I never expected you to do something like that, son-in-<br/>law," said the old hag cheerfully as she handed her the next order.<br/>There was a small exchange of blows as she attempted to grab the<br/>bowls.<p>"If I'm gonna be here, and stuck like this, I might as well make<br/>some extra money," replied the girl as she walked away with several<br/>bowls now balanced on her head.<p>+++++++++++<p>Nabiki seethed as she looked at the walls of Furinkan. Hundreds of<br/>fliers were now stuck on the lockers. She now realized what Ranma had<br/>been doing when she came home so late that night. She'd been making<br/>copies. "That little witch! How dare she undermine me!"<p>She pulled one of them off the wall and stared at the<br/>advertisement hatefully. On the page, were a photo of Ranma in his<br/>girl form, and another snapshot of Shampoo he'd managed to take. The<br/>ad explained that the girls were real waitresses at the restaurant,<br/>and that they'd be happy to serve them as best they could. Implying a<br/>kind of service that she knew wasn't going to happen. Still, the idiot<br/>boys were standing around the places with the fliers on the walls,<br/>drooling like morons. She crumpled up the page and almost screamed in<br/>frustration. Now, not even Kuno would pay her for information about<br/>the place today. She had seen the moronic kendoist staring at one of<br/>the fliers with disgust on his face.<p>"The honorless cur, it disgusts me," he had commented as he turned<br/>away from the page.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"This is fun," deadpanned Ranma as she dodged another set of<br/>throwing knives and a crushing mace blow with bowls of hot soup<br/>balanced all across her arms.<p>"Well, it's good training," said Carrot lazily.<p>"It takes all three of us to navigate this mess, you just worry<br/>about that pill," snapped Dan as he casually sidestepped another<br/>volley of thrown weapons.<p>Shampoo and Mousse had both started to take any cheap shot they<br/>could get in while they worked. Cologne had ordered her to not chase<br/>the girl away during business hours, but leaving work each night had<br/>become a mad dash to escape the pair. It was no coincidence that the<br/>woman did not command them to stop attacking her. Fortunately, they<br/>were very careful about hitting customers, and only attempted to kill<br/>her when they had a clear shot.<p>Cologne hopped up to them and smiled after her deliveries were<br/>made. "Son in law, come with me for a moment."<p>++++++++++++<p>"I'd like to show you something," said the old woman as she<br/>started a fire and pulled out a bag of chestnuts from her robe.<p>"Huh?" muttered Ranma in confusion as she watched the old woman<br/>toss the bag into the fire.<p>"Watch closely," said Cologne. She then proceeded to reach in and<br/>pluck them out of the fire.<p>"Not bad," commented Ranma as her eyes narrowed.<p>"With this technique, taking the Phoenix Pill will be child's<br/>play," said the old woman cheerfully. She hopped away and left the<br/>redhead alone to her own devices for a while.<p>+++++++++++<p>"What is that idiot doing?" muttered Akane as she watched the girl<br/>sit out in the yard with a small campfire.<p>"She's been at it for a week now," commented Nabiki lazily.<p>"Is she still working at that restaurant?" asked Akane as she<br/>looked at her sister.<p>"Every night," said the girl with a nod. "We hardly ever see your<br/>fiancee."<p>"Good," snapped Akane.<p>Genma walked out and frowned at his son. "Boy! What do you think<br/>you're doing?"<p>"Training," was the reply as Ranma burned her hands yet again.<p>"This new job of yours is taking away from your skills! I won't<br/>allow it!" snapped Genma angrily.<p>Ranma looked down at the small, slightly burnt wristwatch she had<br/>started wearing. "Hey, it's time for Dragonball." She stood up and<br/>started towards the television.<p>"That's enough boy! You're going soft!" snapped Genma as he hefted<br/>the girl over his shoulder. Ranma twisted in midair and landed on her<br/>feet.<p>"Right, I think I showed you how soft I've been getting," snapped<br/>Ranma angrily as she charged the man.<p>"What?" muttered Genma in surprise.<p>Ranma had vanished, and then reappeared directly in front of him.<br/>Genma quickly snapped out of his stupor and attacked. Ranma was<br/>dancing around him as easily as if it was Akane fighting him. "What's<br/>the matter old man? Can't hit me?"<p>"Boy, you should learn some respect!" snapped Genma as he pushed<br/>himself a little harder, no longer holding back.<p>Ranma took a blow too the side of his head and staggered back for<br/>a moment. "Not bad old man."<p>"Huh?" muttered Genma in shock as he looked at his fist.<p>"Ha!" cried Ranma as he jumped up and kicked the man in his face.<br/>Genma was sent across the back yard by the force of the blow, and<br/>didn't stop until he slammed into the wall.<p>Ranma snorted and turned towards the TV.<p>+++++++++++<p>It was a rerun, but that didn't matter much because the boys were<br/>talking amongst themselves inside Ranma's head again.<p>"What just happened?" said Ranma. "Since when are we that good?"<p>"Easy, we've been training for six hours a night," said Carrot<br/>calmly. "Shampoo and Mousse spend all their time trying to kill us. We<br/>dodge that while balancing bowls, plus we attack that old ghoul every<br/>chance we get. What did you expect?"<p>"I never thought about it like that, I've just been focused on<br/>that pill," said Ranma dumbly.<p>"Great," muttered Dan. "So, now what?"<p>"Ranma hasn't learned the Chestnut Fist," said Carrot. "We keep<br/>doing this until he does."<p>"Makes sense," said Dan with an indifferent shrug.<p>"Man, I barely felt that punch," said Ranma as he looked back at<br/>his father, who was still sleeping against the wall outside.<p>"Well, we beat ourselves up on a regular basis," commented Carrot.<p>"You jerks deserved that beating! I said I wanted Thai!" snapped<br/>Dan defensively.<p>"We wanted Ramen," countered Ranma.<p>"Let's not start that again," said Carrot irritably. "Look, the<br/>fact is that this is good for us. So we keep doing it."<p>"Right," agreed the others.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Follow the rabbit? What the hell does that mean?" said Minako as<br/>she wandered through the streets of Juban.<p>Artemis was poking his head out of her purse, and watching the<br/>road. "It is a bit cryptic, all we've found so far are a few<br/>magicians. Bad ones at that."<p>"So, do we give up and go home now?" said Minako in a slightly<br/>whiny voice.<p>"I suppose there's nothing else we can do," agreed Artemis.<p>"Gahhh! I hate school!" said a rather loud girl from behind them.<p>"You should study for your tests more," commented a goofy looking<br/>boy that stood next to her.<p>"Shut up Umino! Don't you have a home?" snapped the blonde<br/>irritably. She had a rather unusual hairstyle.<p>"Don't be so mean Usagi, he didn't mean it," said the girl who was<br/>standing next to her.<p>"Of course I meant it! How do you expect to be successful without<br/>an education?" cried Umino.<p>"Marry a rich man?" said Usagi obliviously. "I suppose you're<br/>right Naru, I mean, I'm still young and all."<p>"I didn't mean you shouldn't study at all," said the girl.<p>Artemis and Minako looked at each other for a moment as the group<br/>walked by them.<p>"Usagi?" said the cat.<p>"You don't think?" said Minako.<p>"Let's go!" Artemis put his ears back and stared forward at the<br/>girl. "Don't let her get away!"<p>Just beside them, a shadowy figure watched the scene and chuckled<br/>to herself. "Right! Everything is going according to the plan!" She<br/>watched them vanish into the crowd and turned to melt into the<br/>shadows. The effect was ruined, as a loud clanging noise, followed by<br/>a crash filled the deserted alley. "Ouchies! Stupid fire escape<br/>ladder!" squealed Tsuki as she found herself sprawled out in a pile of<br/>garbage bags. She was rubbing her forehead and glaring at the<br/>offending object above her irritably. After a moment of grumbling to<br/>herself, she looked up at the sky with tears in her eyes. "Don't worry<br/>Pluto-sama! I won't fail, not like you did!"<p>++++++++++++<p>"Have you mastered that technique I showed you yet?" said Cologne<br/>as she jumped over the wall of the Tendo home and paused.<p>Ranma was smiling cheerfully, dressed in a yukata with the rest of<br/>the family. "Hie, boss!"<p>"What's going on here? I expected you to be in training," said<br/>Cologne as she hopped over to the girl's side.<p>"I'm takin a little time off today. We're going to the fair," said<br/>the redhead cheerfully. "Hey, I got the haunted house from seven to<br/>eight right?"<p>"That is correct," confirmed Cologne as she watched them wander<br/>towards the door.<p>"Kay, see ya then," said Ranma as she followed after them. "Hey!<br/>Wait up you jerks!"<p>"Most unusual," said Cologne to herself as she hopped away.<p>++++++++++<p>"Come on, be a man!" said Ranma as she looked down at the boy who<br/>was sitting next to her at one of the food booths at the fair. He was<br/>becoming violently sick. "Jeez, one little drink and you're done<br/>already?" She took another shot of Sake and left him with the bill.<p>Akane was watching the scene in shocked horror. "What are you<br/>doing?"<p>"Having a drink," said Ranma obliviously.<p>"With a boy?" snapped the girl angrily.<p>"Hey, he offered too buy me a drink," said the girl with a shrug.<br/>"I said yes."<p>"You pervert!" snapped Akane.<p>"If I am, it's none of your business is it?" replied the redhead<br/>calmly.<p>"But...I..." stammered Akane.<p>"Look, the kid thought he was being a badass when he offered too<br/>buy me a drink. Thought he'd impress me with how wild and rebellious<br/>he was. I taught him a lesson. It's amazing what these jerks will do<br/>to impress a pretty girl."<p>"What?" said Akane dumbly.<p>"Heh, that idiot thought he could match me drink for drink," said<br/>Ranma cheerfully.<p>"How many did you have?" said Akane as she looked back at the<br/>unfortunate boy. He was still getting sick.<p>"Well, I downed six at first, plus two more after he started doing<br/>that," said Ranma as he looked back at the scene for a moment. "That's<br/>eight."<p>"Well, I'm impressed Saotome," said Nabiki as she walked up to<br/>them. "Win a lot of bets that way?"<p>"I'd planned on starting. I've got a very high alcohol tolerance,"<br/>said the redhead casually. "I just had eight drinks, and all I feel<br/>right now is a little warm."<p>"Boy! Why didn't you tell me you discovered the Saotome Secret<br/>Drinking Technique?" said Genma as he slapped Ranma in the back of her<br/>head.<p>"Huh? We've got a family technique for that?" said the girl<br/>dumbly.<p>Genma looked up and saw the Tendos staring at him. "Um, no. Of<br/>course not boy, I was just joking."<p>"Saotome, I seem to recall an evening that led up to this glorious<br/>union between the schools..."<p>"Don't worry about it Tendo. I assure you I was just as drunk as<br/>you were," said Genma in what was an obvious lie.<p>"My poor departed wife nearly decapitated me for that! How could<br/>you Saotome!"<p>"Calm down Tendo, it worked out for the best in the end, didn't<br/>it?" comforted Genma as he pat the man on his back.<p>Ranma decided to slip away as the two men now had the angry<br/>attention of three teenage girls on them.<p>She walked near a fish catching booth and listened to the call of<br/>the man working there for a moment.<p>"Catch em all take em home for free!"<p>"Heh," she strolled over and sat down in front of the tank. "I'll<br/>take that challenge."<p>++++++++++<p>Soun and Genma were lying in the middle of the midway, beaten too<br/>within an inch of their lives when Akane walked up behind her and saw<br/>the prizes Ranma had won. She had several bags full of fish, and a<br/>large tank full of piranha.<p>"Where did you get those?" she asked dumbly.<p>"Huh? Oh, I won them playing that game over there," replied the<br/>redhead casually as she handed the tank over to the girl. "Here, hold<br/>this for a minute."<p>"You mean where that man is crying, and putting up a closed sign?"<p>"Yup, that's the one," said Ranma cheerfully. She was handing out<br/>the fish too a large group of children that was passing by. "There.<br/>I'd give those away, but they're dangerous." Said the redhead as she<br/>took the tank back. "See ya later, I've got to go work my shift at the<br/>haunted house now."<p>Akane merely waved and watched her go.<p>++++++++++++<p>Carrot smirked as he strolled up to Cologne. "Hiya, boss."<p>"Good, you're here," said the old woman as she glanced back at<br/>Shampoo for a moment. "Fifteen minutes early too."<p>"Yeah well," said the redhead with a shrug. She glanced at the<br/>Amazon girl and frowned for a moment. "It'll be hard to work with her<br/>and her boyfriend trying to kill me the whole time."<p>"They are not permitted to attack you at the moment," said Cologne<br/>cheerfully.<p>"I bet you thought I'd be a little more pressured to go with you<br/>with those two idiots trying to kill me huh?"<p>"My but you're perceptive," chuckled Cologne.<p>"I mastered that technique by the way," said Ranma as she held up<br/>her hand and dangled the pill's box in front of the woman's face.<p>"Gah! How?"<p>"Not bad huh?" said the redhead cheerfully. She popped open the<br/>box and took the candy drop from inside. "Hey, it's grape!" she said<br/>cheerfully as she walked over to where she would get her makeup and<br/>costume from. "Thanks for the candy drop."<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes at the girl. "He is perceptive. Even I<br/>would have assumed that it was the real pill."<p>+++++++++++<p>"Boy! What are you doing?" snapped Genma angrily as he saw Ranma<br/>standing in front of the haunted house in a kimono. She was holding a<br/>small lantern in front of her and announcing the presence of the<br/>attraction to the passing crowd.<p>"Attracting customers," said the girl obliviously. "And getting<br/>hit on a lot too," she added with a slight frown.<p>"Wow, you look good in a kimono, Saotome," said Nabiki as she<br/>strolled up with her sisters.<p>"What kind of man takes a job like this?" snapped Genma as he<br/>attempted too grab hi son. She sidestepped and he fell flat on his<br/>face.<p>"A man who's cursed to turn into a girl," said Ranma with a small<br/>shrug as she looked down at him. "You guys goin in?"<p>"Of course," said Nabiki cheerfully.<p>"It probably isn't scary anyway," muttered Akane.<p>"Oh my! I think I'll wait out here," said Kasumi nervously.<p>"Enjoy," said Ranma as she watched the two younger girls go into<br/>the building. Akane was dragging the crying Soun in by his collar.<p>"Really Tendo!" said her father as he walked just behind them.<p>Kasumi turned towards Ranma and frowned. "It doesn't bother you<br/>that you turn into a girl?"<p>"Huh?" Ranma blinked at her and then smiled. "Of course it does,<br/>but if you have to live with it, live with it well."<p>"I see. So you're making the best of the situation?" said the girl<br/>with an understanding smile.<p>"You've got it!" said the redhead as she winked at her.<p>++++++++++++<p>"I'm Sailor Moon?" said Usagi in shock as she looked down at<br/>herself in wonder.<p>Luna nodded her head. "That's right, defender of love and justice!<br/>The pretty sailor soldier! Sailor Moon!"<p>"So, I find you at last Sailor Moon."<p>Both Usagi and Luna turned and gasped as they saw Sailor V<br/>standing in the window, watching them both. A small white cat padded<br/>its way around her feet silently.<p>"Who?" muttered Usagi in confusion.<p>"Artemis?" gasped Luna in shock as she stared at the white cat.<p>++++++++++<p>"Bwahahahahaha! My master plan is going exactly as I had<br/>envisioned it!" said Tsuki as she stood on a rooftop nearby and<br/>pointed her finger up at the moon. "Soon, I shall awaken all the<br/>Senshi, and then we'll destroy the one who dared hurt my, Mistress<br/>Pluto!"<p>+++++++++++<p>Naru woke up in the dead of night and walked down the stairs. She<br/>rubbed her eyes sleepily and paused when she saw her mother in the<br/>middle of the room with a large sack of jewelry in her grasp.<p>"Mom? What's going on?"<p>The thing that looked like her mother slowly turned around, and<br/>glared at her.<p>++++++++++++<p>Pluto opened her eyes, she was still inside her healing tank, but<br/>her body was looking much better now. Unfortunately, she still had a<br/>long way to go before she could leave the protective liquid. "No!<br/>What's he doing here so early?" she thought as she stared into the<br/>darkness. "It's too soon! They shouldn't be here yet! What is<br/>happening?" Her mind turned the situation over and over. She could<br/>come up with only one answer. "Genaku." It had to be. He was the only<br/>one with enough chaos around him to manipulate events beyond the time<br/>gate's vision. She clenched her jaw, causing a new surge of pain<br/>through her body. He had to be destroyed, now more than ever.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time, a day at the beach, and more Genaku.<p>
