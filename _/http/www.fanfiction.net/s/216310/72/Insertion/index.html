</div>Insertion<p>Part 72<p>The beginning of something new<p>++++++++++<p>It was a quiet day in the Hibiki household.<br/>Usagi was doing her homework at the table, while<br/>her mother sat with Dan and Carrot in the living<br/>room. The three had separated only a few minutes<br/>before just outside. To Usagi, it seemed as if her<br/>mother had invited them over or something. It<br/>wasn't a new development at any rate.<p>Yohiko frowned at the two men as they stared<br/>at the television and stood up, moving to the back<br/>of the home and into her room.<p>Carrot smirked at this and followed shortly<br/>after.<p>Dan glanced around and sighed. "Oh well. Come<br/>on kid, you and I are going out," he said as he<br/>stood up and walked over to Usagi.<p>The girl looked up at him and blinked. "Huh?<br/>I've got to do this for..."<p>"It can wait, Carrot and your mother seem to<br/>have something to discuss in private," said the<br/>man with a rough sounding snort.<p>The girl blinked at this as she just missed<br/>grasping what he was telling her in a round about<br/>way. "Um, sure I guess. Where are we going?"<p>"I feel like a beer, but since you're coming,<br/>I guess I'll have to make do with ice-cream."<p>The girl smiled cheerfully at this and jumped<br/>up from her seat. "Great!"<p>"I just hope she doesn't eat as much as her<br/>namesake," grumbled Dan under his breath as he<br/>walked out the door after her.<p>The girl didn't appear to hear him and<br/>cheerfully rushed off in front of him. "Come on! I<br/>know a great place near here!"<p>"Yeah, yeah," muttered Dan irritably.<p>++++++++++++<p>Carrot shoved Xianfu against the wall and<br/>smirked as she stared at him. Neither of them was<br/>wearing a shirt at the moment and they simply<br/>stood for a moment as they were. Their eyes<br/>warring with each other for dominance.<p>Yohiko had her skirt hiked up around her<br/>waist, and one of her legs was wrapped around the<br/>man's waist.<p>He smirked a little more and rubbed his hand<br/>down her thigh, pushing her nylon stocking down a<br/>little. "So, here we are again."<p>The woman put her face up to his, their lips<br/>only a hair's width away from each other. "So it<br/>seems."<p>"You don't look like you're enjoying<br/>yourself," said Carrot with a small chuckle as he<br/>shoved her up against the wall. His chest pushed<br/>her breasts up against her body, sending<br/>sensations coursing through her. Her nipples<br/>hardened and she gave an almost mocking snort.<p>"You disgust me."<p>"I know," he replied calmly as he leaned in a<br/>little more, touching his cheek against hers.<br/>"Intoxicating isn't it?"<p>"What? You think I care about you? Is that<br/>it?" she snorted.<p>"Care? I wouldn't say that," he said as he<br/>breathed into her ear. The heat of his breath<br/>causing her to shudder as she clutched at his back<br/>a little tighter with her hands.<p>"Stop teasing me then," she said coldly.<p>"You've known me long enough to know that I<br/>enjoy teasing you," he said in a soft whisper.<p>"A little too much," she said as she pulled<br/>his head back a little with her hand.<p>"Sometimes," he replied. "Right now, you love<br/>it though."<p>"Do you hate me?" she asked calmly.<p>"No, I don't," said Carrot as he pulled at her<br/>pigtail, jerking her head back gently. "Ranma<br/>does."<p>"Does he? So, this is just you then?" she said<br/>with a cruel smile on her face.<p>"No, both of us seem to enjoy this pastime,"<br/>replied the man coolly.<p>"Both of you?" she said as she glared into his<br/>eyes. The hatred there causing an exhilarating<br/>tremor of fear to run down her spine.<p>"I never forgave you for what you did to us,<br/>but Ranma, has not accepted it. I doubt if he ever<br/>will."<p>"So, what do you think of me then? Is it love,<br/>something I can throw in your face?" she said<br/>coldly.<p>"No, you're a real bitch, but you are<br/>beautiful. I suppose that helps," said Carrot as<br/>he kissed her roughly. She responded by pushing<br/>back with as much force as he gave.<p>Carrot felt her tongue push gently between his<br/>lips, inviting him to open his mouth. He pulled<br/>back and chuckled.<p>"You don't get it at all do you?" he said to<br/>her.<p>She cocked her head in a slightly annoyed and<br/>confused fashion.<p>"Don't you understand woman? I am evil.<br/>Everything dark in this world is mine, my doing,<br/>my plan. I am the devil, and you, you are the<br/>goddess."<p>"Is that so?" she said with a small smirk of<br/>her own.<p>"You and Pissant represent the light, and<br/>myself and Ranma are the darkness. He's fallen<br/>from grace, not as innocent as he once was. I'm<br/>cold, calculating, and evil. The emotion he feels<br/>the most is anger and rage. We rule hell, and<br/>you..."<p>"I am what?"<p>"You're justice, Pissant is kindness and<br/>forgiveness," replied the man coldly. "You know<br/>it, and it drives you up the wall that you're so<br/>attracted to it." He whispered this into her ear<br/>and kissed her neck, moving slowly down towards<br/>her shoulder, stopping to suck softly with each<br/>subtle movement of his neck. "You love it, because<br/>you know it's wrong."<p>She muttered through her soft moans. "What<br/>does that make Dan?"<p>"Neutral. He's the deciding vote, the one who<br/>decides which of us will win, when it comes down<br/>to a decision."<p>"The middle ground?" she said as she pulled<br/>his head back and gently nipped at his chin. "Is<br/>that it?"<p>"You're not a fool," replied Carrot calmly as<br/>his hand caressed her breast softly. Their lips<br/>met again, this time he welcomed her tongue and<br/>responded with his own.<p>"What is it that you get out of this?" she<br/>asked coolly.<p>"My reasons are the same as yours, lover," he<br/>replied simply.<p>"Love has no place with us. Don't call me<br/>that," she said with a slightly angry snarl in her<br/>voice.<p>"Fair enough. You know, I'm the only thing<br/>stopping him from killing you now," said the man<br/>with a slight growl to his voice. "I almost want<br/>to set him loose on you."<p>"You won't though," she replied. "I know I'm<br/>safe in your arms."<p>"Are you?" he prodded as he kissed her cheek.<p>"Oh yes," she said passionately. "You could,<br/>but you won't. I don't think you ever will." She<br/>could feel the waves of negative emotion pouring<br/>from his soul. It sent a tingling sensation down<br/>her body as her danger sense kicked in, adrenaline<br/>coursed through her veins.<p>Carrot chuckled as he brushed the soft flesh<br/>of her neck with his hand, tracing her jawline<br/>slowly. "You're right."<p>"Why is that? Why won't you?"<p>"Because I enjoy this game as much as you do,"<br/>he replied simply.<p>He squeezed her breast again and slowly slid<br/>his hand down her belly.<p>She pressed herself up against the wall as he<br/>did this, aching for release. "Stop toying with<br/>me."<p>"I'll stop when I feel like stopping," he<br/>replied with a cruel smirk. Once again, he had won<br/>the battle of wills.<p>"So what does that make us? Enemies?" she<br/>snapped as she stared at him with an anger of her<br/>own.<p>"No, we're partners, and we always will be.<br/>Family, mate, soulmate, opposites. We are a part<br/>of a single being."<p>"And this is your way of jerking off?" she<br/>replied snidely.<p>"Everyone needs a little release, and Hotaru<br/>isn't here to play with us anymore," replied the<br/>boy in an equally condescending tone.<p>"So. Go ahead and vent then," she said as she<br/>shoved him back away from the wall and forced him<br/>down onto the bed, straddling him forcefully.<p>Carrot smirked as she pressed down his<br/>shoulders and stared him dead in the eyes,<br/>signaling that she hadn't yet given up the fight<br/>just yet. She leaned forward, brushing the tips of<br/>her nipples along his chest as she did so. "Do you<br/>want this body?"<p>"Is this a trick question?" he responded<br/>calmly, his smile never once leaving his lips<br/>throughout all this.<p>"I'm tired of playing, and I've got the<br/>advantage now. No more talking, understand?"<p>Carrot smirked as she locked her lips on his<br/>again and forced her tongue into his mouth,<br/>forcing her way through his teeth. His resistance<br/>was minimal though. She broke off and he simply<br/>chuckled.<p>"Why do you kiss me, if you hate me?" he<br/>asked.<p>She narrowed her eyes at this and smiled back.<br/>"Because it feels wrong. It's very satisfying."<p>"So you admit I'm right?" he responded.<p>"I never said you weren't," she said coolly.<br/>Her hand slid under the waist of his pants, and he<br/>arched his head back, finally submitting.<p>"Hmmm. Good boy," she said with a slight<br/>cooing in her tone.<p>"Never have been," he said through a small<br/>gasp.<p>"Well, that's what makes this so<br/>entertaining."<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Dan sighed as he watched the girl eat yet<br/>another bowl of ice cream. He'd only ordered one<br/>for himself, and he was still picking at the soupy<br/>remains.<p>"That was great!" said the girl cheerfully.<br/>"So, do you think they're done fucking yet?"<p>Dan almost fell face first on the table. "What<br/>the?"<p>"Oh come on! I'm not that stupid! I may just<br/>be a kid, but I'm not that young!" said the girl<br/>as she laughed at him.<p>"I know that, I was just surprised about how<br/>you put it," he said a little sourly as he glared<br/>at her for a moment.<p>"Well, they don't seem to like each other<br/>much," said Usagi. "It's weird really."<p>"I suppose so, they didn't used to be this<br/>bad," said Dan with a small shrug.<p>"Really?" said Usagi in surprise.<p>"No, before, she was just trying to kill us<br/>all the time," said the man with a small shrug.<p>"Oh," said the girl as she blinked at the<br/>comment. "This is better than that though, right?"<p>"Not really," said Dan with a small frown. "At<br/>least she leaves me alone these days."<p>"Why do you visit so often?" asked Usagi.<p>"Because Carrot is a horny bastard, and so is<br/>your mother," replied Dan with another shrug.<p>"Hey!" cried the girl.<p>"This from the girl who just told me that her<br/>mother was fucking some guy right now?" snorted<br/>the man in retort.<p>"Oh, well I guess you've got a point there,"<br/>grumbled the girl irritably.<p>"Yeah, pretty much," he responded with a<br/>slight frown. The voice in side his head was<br/>scolding him angrily about speaking in such a<br/>manner to such a young girl. He pinched his leg<br/>and it quieted down for the most part.<p>"What did you mean about 'namesake'?" asked<br/>the girl suddenly.<p>"Huh?" said Dan dumbly.<p>"You said something about a namesake when we<br/>left the house. Oh, yeah." The girl seemed to<br/>remember something and Dan felt a sharp pain on<br/>his leg.<p>"Ouch! Damn it!" he cried irritably. "What the<br/>hell?"<p>"What do you mean eat as much as my<br/>'namesake'? Are you callin me fat?"<p>"Actually, she was as skinny as a bean pole.<br/>Grew up to be quite a pretty lady," responded Dan.<br/>"She could pack away twice as much ice-cream as<br/>you just ate."<p>The girl blushed at this and muttered an<br/>apology. She looked up at him again and sighed.<br/>"Her name was Usagi?"<p>"Yeah. I'm not sure if your mother named her<br/>after you, or if she just liked the name. We all<br/>knew her, but Carrot and I knew her a lot longer<br/>than your mother did." The statement was full of<br/>half-truths, but Dan wasn't about to start<br/>explaining that they were the Supreme Being reborn<br/>in a human body...sort of.<p>Dan looked at his watch and sighed. "Come on.<br/>We should get back."<p>The girl sighed and nodded her head. "All<br/>right. Thanks Mr. Dan."<p>"Whatever," replied the man with a shrug. "I<br/>just wanted to get away from all that screaming<br/>for a while. It's no place for a girl your age to<br/>be either. Even if you have done it before<br/>yourself."<p>Usagi froze and stared at him. "Wha?"<p>"Thought I didn't know about that did you?"<p>"MOM TOLD YOU?"<p>"Naw, Carrot and I are in on the whole<br/>'Shadow' thing," replied the man with a shrug. "He<br/>thought it was funny as hell. Me, not so much."<p>The girl blushed and quietly followed the man<br/>as he went to pay the bill.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Carrot sat up staring at the wall. Xianfu was<br/>sleeping soundly beside him, her naked body<br/>covered in the sheets. He mulled silently and<br/>turned to look at her for a moment.<p>"You think we had something to do with this?"<br/>asked Ranma suddenly.<p>"With what we've been doing? The way we feel<br/>about her? No, I don't think so."<p>"But?" insisted Ranma.<p>"Right, but I also think we know about it, and<br/>we're using it somehow."<p>"How do you feel about her?" snorted Ranma.<p>"If you're wondering if I'm in love with her,<br/>no. I don't love her. I don't know what it is,<br/>it's similar, but not love," replied Carrot<br/>calmly.<p>"So you like her?"<p>"No more than you do, but it's different. I'm<br/>not as direct as you, you should know that by<br/>now," said Carrot with a small chuckle. "There is<br/>some feeling there. It's a bond, I'd almost say<br/>family. Not quite, more like I'm clinging to a<br/>part of myself that I don't like, but I can't let<br/>go."<p>Ranma nodded at this. "I understand."<p>"Same for you too huh?" said Carrot with a<br/>small snort of amusement.<p>"Shut up!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Stop it," said Carrot coolly. "You and I both<br/>know it's true. We're more connected to each other<br/>than the others are. There isn't much you can hide<br/>from me."<p>"Same here, don't forget it," snapped Ranma.<p>"Much as I hate to admit it, I do care. I<br/>don't want her to die, she deserves us more,"<br/>replied Carrot with a cold smile on his face.<br/>"She'll get what she deserves."<p>"Let me kill her," snarled Ranma.<p>"No," replied Carrot.<p>"You're going soft."<p>"You've just grown to hard, that's all."<p>"Going to hell will do that to a man," snapped<br/>Ranma.<p>"Didn't do it to me," retorted Carrot.<p>"You're different, you've changed too. Not for<br/>the better either," said Ranma.<p>"Maybe so, but we fit our roles as well," said<br/>Carrot with a somewhat broken grin on his face.<br/>"You've got to learn how to calm down. You're as<br/>bad as this Akane used to be sometimes."<p>"I..."<p>"We aren't in hell anymore Ranma," responded<br/>Carrot. "He's dead, we've righted the wrongs,<br/>we've won."<p>"..."<p>"Our real victory is yet to come, have<br/>patience. We've got all the time in the universe."<p>"Ya really mean that too," said Ranma. He<br/>chuckled at the realization and shook his head.<br/>"Tired yet?"<p>"Naw."<p>"Then why is she sleeping?"<p>Carrot looked down at Xianfu and brushed her<br/>hair out of her face with his fingers. She shifted<br/>and muttered to herself in her sleep. His hand<br/>paused over her neck for the briefest of moments,<br/>and he smirked.<p>He leaned in and kissed her, rolling onto her<br/>a little.<p>Slowly she opened her eyes and returned the<br/>kiss. Neither one of them said a word.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>It was morning. Carrot sat up and shielded<br/>their face from the rays of the sun. He squinted<br/>and groaned in irritation. "Damn. Why is morning<br/>so damn early?"<p>"Shut up," muttered Xianfu as she rolled over<br/>onto her side and pulled the covers a little<br/>tighter onto her body.<p>Carrot froze. Very slowly, he turned his head<br/>and looked at the small alarm clock that rested on<br/>the small table beside the bed. He gasped when he<br/>noticed the time. "Eight hours."<p>"What's going on?" grumbled Ranma irritably.<p>"Ranma, it's been eight hours. Something is<br/>wrong."<p>"Wha?" muttered the lazy voice.<p>"Dan? You in here?" said Carrot.<p>"Who are you talking too?" asked Xianfu as she<br/>sat up and slammed her pillow into their faces.<br/>She slumped back down and started to snore again.<p>Carrot narrowed his eyes at her and jerked the<br/>blankets away, tossing her roughly out of bed.<p>"What the hell? You bastard!" screamed the<br/>woman as she jumped to her feet. She paused and<br/>blinked at him for a moment. "Again? Isn't it a<br/>little early for this?"<p>He looked down at himself and his clothes<br/>melted into place, she did the same and frowned in<br/>confusion.<p>"Do you have Dan with you?" asked the man<br/>calmly.<p>"Huh?" she looked blank for a moment. "No.<br/>Didn't he leave already?"<p>"Shit," muttered Carrot. "We never went back<br/>last night."<p>"Huh?"<p>"Something is up. We're still separated," said<br/>Carrot as he frowned at her. "We never merged back<br/>last night."<p>"Maybe we did it in our sleep?" muttered the<br/>woman irritably.<p>"I don't think so, all of us at the same time<br/>is unlikely," said Carrot as he glanced around.<br/>"We should find Dan."<p>"Maybe he did it?" she muttered.<p>"That wouldn't have separated the three of<br/>us," said Carrot.<p>Xianfu frowned and opened the bedroom door.<br/>She walked out into the hall and frowned as she<br/>noticed the man sleeping with a bottle of alcohol<br/>in his hand at the table.<p>"Wake up idiot," she snapped.<p>"Hun? Whazzis?" he muttered as he sat upright<br/>and glanced around. "Hey. Took ya long enough. I<br/>fell asleep waitin on ya."<p>"Waiting on what?" asked Carrot.<p>"For this thing to run out? What time is it?<br/>How much we got left. I think my watch is busted,"<br/>said the man irritably.<p>"Shit," grumbled Xianfu.<p>"Well, this is just great," muttered Carrot.<p>"You're damn right it is, get out of my<br/>house," said Xianfu as she smirked at them evilly.<br/>"Both of you. You're not welcome here."<p>"Heh. Yohiko Hibiki lives here," replied<br/>Carrot as he shifted forms in front of her,<br/>becoming a mirror image. "Yohiko Hibiki, has my<br/>handwriting too. I'm also the one with all of our<br/>financial information."<p>The woman's face fell. "Shit."<p>"Huh?" said Dan dumbly.<p>"Well, looks like Yohiko Hibiki just got two<br/>more roommates until we figure this out," said<br/>Carrot.<p>"Maybe we just improved a little. It's only<br/>been eight hours," said Dan.<p>"No, doesn't feel right. This is something<br/>else. We should get ahold of Xellos."<p>"I'm afraid you're quite separate, at least<br/>temporarily. It will last quite a while though,"<br/>said the voice as Xellos appeared in the room with<br/>a smirk on his face.<p>"What caused this?" asked Carrot.<p>"This? Well, I'm not entirely sure..." said<br/>Xellos with a smirk on his face.<p>"Can it loon. I know you know exactly what's<br/>going on," snarled Xianfu.<p>"All right, you have me," said the man as he<br/>backed away from the three angry stares. "Some of<br/>it has to do with that little talk you had with<br/>Carrot last night."<p>Xianfu gasped. "What?"<p>"You've started to realize your places in the<br/>grand scheme of things, now it's time for that to<br/>develop a little bit."<p>Carrot frowned at him and shook his head.<br/>"That's not all though. Is it?"<p>"No, but the rest...is a secret."<p>"From us?"<p>"Only myself, and L-sama know the full<br/>details. Nephrite only knows what he needs too,"<br/>said the priest calmly. "I couldn't tell you if I<br/>wanted too. My hands are tied, not that I would if<br/>they weren't though."<p>"I'm betting this was your idea, whatever it<br/>is," said Dan as he glared at Carrot for a moment.<p>The man in question froze and simply stared at<br/>the wall, knowing better than to argue with that<br/>statement. "Heh." Both Dan and Xianfu were glaring<br/>at him.<p>"At any rate, I've said what I need to. See<br/>you later," the mazoku vanished from sight and the<br/>trio all sat down at the table.<p>"Not a bad deal," said Dan with a shrug. "I<br/>get some 'me' time."<p>"Who has Pissant?" asked Carrot as he glanced<br/>at the pair.<p>"He does, the whiner always goes with him,"<br/>said Xainfu as she pointed at Dan.<p>"Yeah, irritating bastard," grumbled the man<br/>sourly. "I can ignore him pretty good though. I<br/>got lots of practice."<p>"Yeah, whatever. "Well, I suppose we're free,<br/>for a while anyway."<p>"Vacation then?" asked Xianfu cheerfully.<p>"I doubt if that'll happen," grumbled Carrot.<p>"Yeah, I hate us," said Dan sourly.<p>"We aren't sure how long we have either,"<br/>pointed out Carrot.<p>"So, we'll work this out later," agreed<br/>Xianfu.<p>"Now what?" asked Dan.<p>"Well, I'm going to wake up my lazy good for<br/>nothing daughter," snorted Xianfu.<p>"Our daughter," replied Carrot calmly.<p>"Yeah, you do that," snorted Dan.<p>"We'll discuss that later," said Xianfu as she<br/>glared at Carrot.<p>"She was my idea, she's based on my real<br/>daughter, so I do have a legitimate claim here.<br/>Don't start getting pissy with me. You'll regret<br/>it, and you know better than to cross me on<br/>something like this," replied Carrot.<p>"What does this matter to you?" she said with<br/>a deep hatred lacing her voice.<p>"I like her, Ranma is attached to her, plus he<br/>wants to irritate you," said Carrot with a shrug.<p>"And you don't?" snorted Dan as he pretended<br/>to ignore the conversation.<p>"Well, I don't think it's a bad idea if that's<br/>what you're asking," replied Carrot cheerfully.<p>"Dick," snorted Xianfu as she turned away.<p>"And that's about all you're interested in<br/>from what I gather," retorted Carrot as he picked<br/>up a newspaper from the table with an indifferent<br/>look on his face.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Carrot sighed as he walked through the streets<br/>of Nerima with his hands in his pockets; or<br/>rather, her pockets. She'd decided to go out as<br/>Yohiko again whenever she was in this area of<br/>town.<p>She paused and stared at the empty building in<br/>front of her and her smirk fell. "What?"<p>The Cat Cafe was closed down.<p>"When did this happen?" said the woman in<br/>confusion as she stared at the note. It informed<br/>anyone interested enough to read it that the<br/>Amazon's had returned to China. "Whoa."<p>Carrot shrugged and turned away, moving down<br/>the street. It was somewhat unexpected, but not a<br/>complete surprise. Soon enough, the Ucchan would<br/>be closing down as well. Ridding the area of the<br/>last remnants of what Carrot and Dan knew as the<br/>'Nerima Wrecking Crew'.<p>"Well. Wanna stop and grab a bite?" asked<br/>Carrot as they looked towards the Ucchan.<p>"Sure, why not?" replied Ranma.<p>The plan was shattered as a young girl turned<br/>the corner in front of a small construction site<br/>down the street.<p>"What the hell?" muttered Ranma in shock.<p>"Hey! That's..." said Carrot dumbly.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Aiya! Is the end for me!" screamed the girl<br/>as she dashed away. A dark mass of black crows<br/>flew behind her, gaining ever closer as they<br/>threatened to overtake her.<p>She gasped as she felt someone grab ahold of<br/>her and swat the birds out of the air as she dove<br/>by them. The strange woman was flicking stones at<br/>them from a small pile at the edge of the<br/>construction site.<p>The bird's dispersed and revealed an angry<br/>looking birdman that glared at her savior angrily.<p>"Kah! Give me that girl!"<p>"Heh. Come get her," replied the woman<br/>confidently.<p>"Kah! You'll die then!"<p>Yohiko jumped back with the girl in her arms<br/>and dashed down the road.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Hmmm. Looks like it might rain again." Ryoga<br/>Hibiki was walking down the road with his umbrella<br/>held over his shoulder as he wandered aimlessly.<br/>His thoughts floated around the strange girl he<br/>had met recently. He'd seen her a few times, and<br/>she was almost as aggressive as Usagi had been, if<br/>not a little more. He wasn't entirely comfortable<br/>with her, especially with her weird pig obsession.<br/>That was for obvious reasons. However, he could<br/>feel his resolve weakening.<p>"Damn you Ryoga Hibiki! Why must you be so<br/>spineless when it comes to women?" he lamented<br/>angrily. He paused when he noticed a familiar<br/>figure running down the road towards him. "Auntie<br/>Yohiko?"<p>"Ryoga! Catch!" cried the woman as she tossed<br/>the girl to him.<p>He caught her without thinking and blinked in<br/>surprise as he looked down at the small Chinese<br/>girl in his arms. "Huh?"<p>"Aiya! I'm delicate!" cried the girl fearfully<br/>as she landed on him a little roughly.<p>Yohiko smirked as she turned to face off<br/>against the birdmen.<p>"Give us the girl landling!" snarled one of<br/>the pair of birdmen who now hovered in the air<br/>behind her.<p>She chuckled and glared at them icily. "Who<br/>are you calling a landling feather boy?"<p>The pair gasped in shock and almost fell out<br/>of the air.<p>Out of Yohiko Hibiki's back, were a huge pair of<br/>bat-like wings. They gave her a ten-foot wingspan<br/>as they spread out wide behind her.<p>"Auntie?" muttered Ryoga in shock.<p>"What is this?" cried one of the birdmen as he<br/>floated up a little higher.<p>"She's not a landling? What is she?" muttered<br/>his companion in confusion.<p>"I've never seen..." muttered the other<br/>birdman dumbly.<p>Yohiko rose into the sky, just as a light rain<br/>started to fall around them.<p>The birdmen crashed to the ground and glared<br/>at the woman, to their surprise she was now slowly<br/>descending towards them with huge flaps of her<br/>wings slowing her decent. The pair now appeared to<br/>be human, their wings gone, and their clawed feet<br/>and hands replaced with human limbs. "It seems<br/>you're the ones with the disadvantage now. How<br/>interesting."<p>"Damn you woman! If it wasn't for this rain,<br/>we'd have kicked your sorry ass!" snapped one of<br/>the two boys.<p>"I seriously doubt that," said Yohiko coldly.<br/>She swat them into the wall with one of her wings<br/>and they slumped to the ground. Ryoga and the<br/>little girl joined in beating them to the ground.<p>"You saved me!" cried the girl as she looked<br/>up at Yohiko and Ryoga. The woman was regarded<br/>with more than a little caution.<p>"Hmm. So, tell me what those flying rats from<br/>Phoenix Mountain were doing chasing you little<br/>girl?"<p>"You are their enemy?" asked the girl<br/>cautiously.<p>Yohiko laughed. "No, but I've heard of them.<br/>Don't worry child, my wings aren't real. My<br/>clothes have a spell on them." It was the easiest<br/>explanation and she shifted into a Chinese style<br/>dress to show the girl. "I've seen your face<br/>before. In a photo on the Jusenkyo guide's desk."<br/>Another lie, but it was the best way to explain<br/>her knowledge.<p>"You are Honored Guest!"<p>"At one time," said the woman with a small<br/>nod.<p>Ryoga gasped at this, his umbrella faltered in<br/>his grip for a moment, but he managed to catch it.<br/>"You mean? You too?"<p>Yohiko sighed. "Not really."<p>"Oh! I'm so glad," said the boy with a<br/>relieved sigh.<p>"Thank you for saving me. I am Plum," said<br/>the girl politely.<p>"No problem. You'll be safe with us. Come on<br/>and tell us about your little problem. Maybe we<br/>can help you," said Yohiko.<p>Ryoga frowned at this and looked at his aunt.<br/>"Huh?"<p>"Come with us, Ryoga," said the woman calmly.<p>"I..." muttered the boy lamely. He sighed and<br/>did as he was told, walking after his Aunt with<br/>his head hung. "I wish, I wish, I wish I had a<br/>spine..."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Next Time: Kiima! Wai! Wai! ^_^<p>
