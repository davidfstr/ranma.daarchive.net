</div>Ahem, before I begin this chapter of Insertion, I would like to<br/>point out that the last chapter of Insertion was in no way related to<br/>'Full Metal Jacket'. It was based on my own personal experience in<br/>Basic Combat Training on Ft. Knox, in Kentucky. I was in the military,<br/>I went through a lot of what the Senshi did during that chapter, and<br/>to be perfectly honest, it lost a lot of the comedy element it was<br/>intended to have because I made it a bit too real for it's own good.<p>In retrospect, I should have added a 'dark' tag to that chapter. I<br/>didn't realize how bad it was till I reread it.<p>I've gotten a lot of people telling me they didn't agree with it,<br/>and a lot more telling me that Full Metal Jacket wasn't a comedy.<br/>Which had absolutely noting to do with this, I say again. That was<br/>Marines Boot Camp anyway, the Senshi have been doing the Army version,<br/>which is called Basic Combat Training, but I digress.<p>I've also gotten a few reviews praising me for my realism, [a far<br/>cry from what one reviewer deemed 1970's training. I can understand<br/>that view given the side of training I showed honestly though.<br/>Military training doesn't change much with the times, they're just<br/>more careful about what they say and do as to not offend anyone, and<br/>they still get away with as much as they can.]<p>A lot of people don't realize exactly what Basic Combat Training<br/>is supposed to do. It's not an entrance exam for the armed forces,<br/>it's designed to break you down, destroy you completely, and then<br/>rebuild you from scratch as a soldier. It's harsh, it's physically<br/>and psychologically trying, and what the Senshi did to Usagi is far<br/>from impossible in such an environment, even for friends as close as<br/>the Senshi. Believe me, I saw it with my own eyes. Friendships, life<br/>long ones at that, were destroyed before even meeting the Drills.<br/>People who joined the service together were at each other's throats<br/>all the time while we were waiting to be assigned to a Unit. I'm<br/>talking about brothers in one case.<p>Now, the warning. This part of Insertion will be extremely violent.<br/>I'm going to write chapter 90 in such a way that you can skip this<br/>chapter if it bothers you that much. This part will be much more<br/>comedic than the last one, but not by much, and even then only after a<br/>short serious scene involving a rather bloody battle. It will get back<br/>to normal again after this, but with the response I got last time it<br/>seemed somewhat necessary to put this here.<p>By the way, I don't hate the Senshi, if I disliked them, I<br/>wouldn't write stories about them. It's the same thing with Nabiki<br/>really. I've been accused of disliking her cause I kill her so often.<br/>Truth is, it's just interesting to put them in this position, and<br/>Nabiki is the easiest character to get rid of in Ranma, well, her and<br/>Kasumi. I just don't feel like dealing with the fallout of killing<br/>Kasumi, so I haven't. That's not to say I won't in the future though.<p>Now, on with the fic...<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Insertion<p>Part 89<p>The Art of War.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Water splashed the side of the tiny vessel as the senshi stood<br/>inside the ship that would take them to their destination. They all<br/>had determined looking frowns on their faces. There were men around<br/>them on all sides as they moved ever closer to the target ahead. It<br/>loomed over the horizon, shrouded in mist.<p>The men surrounding them were all dressed the same as they were,<br/>army fatigues, and they were all silent. The realism of the situation<br/>didn't sit well with Nabiki Tendo as she looked at the fabricated<br/>soldiers for a time from her position at the back of the hold. The<br/>looked nervous, apprehensive, a few had crazed looks on their faces,<br/>there were even a few who looked slightly sick from the motion of the<br/>ship. As if to illustrate this point, one of them threw up, and sent<br/>his lunch splattering across the deck.<p>"Where are we going?" asked Rei pensively. She didn't like this at<br/>all, none of them did.<p>"Pipe down," said Nabiki as she stared forward. She and the pilot<br/>were the only ones who could see the beach in the distance. Flashes of<br/>light, smoke, and a few of the landing craft could be seen there<br/>already. The sound of battle had not yet reached them. "Dear god.<br/>Where are we going?" she thought to herself in horror.<p>Usagi was shaking like a leaf as she stared at the door in front<br/>of her. Those aboard could hear the first thump of artillery. It was<br/>still quiet yet, but was steadily growing louder and more dangerous<br/>sounding. She squeezed her eyes shut as the distinctive sound of<br/>automatic fire could be heard over the morning haze. A haze that<br/>smelled suspiciously like something burning.<p>"I can't do this..." she muttered to herself.<p>"Little late to go back now," commented one of the nervous men<br/>beside her with a somewhat cheerful smile. It faded the instant he<br/>turned his gaze away from her.<p>Minako glanced at the man for a moment, he was roguishly handsome.<br/>The kind of man she would have found herself talking too easily if she<br/>had been home. Unfortunately, she wasn't home.<p>"Get ready," commanded Nabiki as she strolled down the middle of<br/>the ranks of men and moved towards the door that would let them out of<br/>the troop transport. Her gaze was calm and cool, and her jaw was firm<br/>and tight. She simply stared forward as best she could. "Fix bayonets!<br/>Make sure your weapons are ready to fire as soon as your feet hit the<br/>ground!"<p>Those around her immediately followed her orders.<p>Makoto turned her head to see a Hispanic looking man holding a<br/>cross up to his forehead and saying a prayer to himself. "My god, what<br/>the hell are we doing?" she muttered fearfully as she clutched her<br/>weapon a bit tighter. She found she couldn't hear her own voice from<br/>the now deafening roar of the battle outside.<p>The door opened, and all hell broke loose.<p>Five men fell the instant the ramp was dropped. They slumped over<br/>dead as those behind them rushed forward over their corpses. Nabiki<br/>charged out first, running as fast as she could towards the beach. The<br/>water was only knee high where they had landed, but a quick and costly<br/>glance around would tell them that many others were not so lucky.<p>They rushed forward, towards the large buildings that loomed<br/>overhead. The machine gun fire roaring around them as they pushed<br/>through the fallen bodies of others who had not been so lucky. Mortar<br/>fire hit the ground around them, and the bunkers were seemingly<br/>impossible to reach on the uphill slope that started where the beach<br/>ended.<p>The bunkers were monstrosities of concrete and sandbags, dug into<br/>the high ground overhead, with a single long slit across the front for<br/>machine gun emplacements. Total blackness was all you could see inside<br/>the bunkers aside from the flash of a muzzle as those inside fired<br/>down on the invading force.<p>Minako fell to the ground as one of the explosions sent a mass of<br/>sand into the air around her. She gasped and clutched her weapon as<br/>she rolled onto her side and looked down the length of her body.<br/>Everything was still there. She shook her head and started to stagger<br/>too her feet. Ami was beside her and she put her hand on the girl's<br/>shoulder, trying to get her attention so they could move forward<br/>together.<p>She paused when she got no response and looked down from the back<br/>of her friend's head. She had been blown in half at her torso. The<br/>girl screamed in horror as she staggered to her feet and stepped back<br/>away from Ami's body. A dull thump that she felt more than heard hit<br/>her suddenly. With wide eyes she looked down at the growing red stain<br/>in the center of her chest and opened her mouth. Blood poured out from<br/>between her lips and she fell to her knees. She was kneeling on<br/>someone's arm, for reason's she didn't know, she looked down to see<br/>the man she'd seen speaking to Usagi lying dead there. Unable to<br/>speak, she fell forward into the sand face first. Then, there was<br/>darkness.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Usagi Tsukino found herself leaning against the edge of the beach,<br/>on a sand dune just before the incline that would lead them to the<br/>complex. There were several others beside her, but no one she knew. A<br/>man with a single gold bar on his helmet turned to look at her.<p>"You have any grenades?" he asked.<p>Usagi nodded once and looked him in the eyes. "Yes sir."<p>"Good, Peters here lost his on the way in. We're gonna need some<br/>power to get that bunker. All we've got are grenades; the units with<br/>RPGs got misrouted about a quarter of a mile down the beach. They're<br/>going to try to punch through the side. For now, we've got six<br/>grenades." He pointed towards the man lying next to him, apparently<br/>not realizing that the soldier had a hole in his forehead just yet.<p>"I've got three more sir," she replied nervously.<p>"Good, our radio is dead now," replied the man as he held up a<br/>smoking piece of equipment and showed it to her.<p>The girl found herself wondering why they had a radio like that at<br/>all. The equipment they had used during training was much more<br/>advanced.<p>"Lay down some cover fire, we're going to try and go around that<br/>way and get close enough to toss a few into the bunker!" said the man<br/>as he pointed towards a path that led up to the small fortress that<br/>was laying fire down on the beach.<p>Usagi nodded and handed him her grenades. She slowly edged herself<br/>up towards the top of the hill, flinching with each spray of sand that<br/>the bullets striking it caused. With a sudden burst of will, she<br/>lurched forward and started firing.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Rei and Makoto were pushing through the mass of bodies, and what<br/>was left of some of the living. They ignored the screams of pain from<br/>the mangled and torn remains of the artificial soldiers. It wasn't<br/>easy though; they looked far too real.<p>Neither one spoke as they wove through the battlefield. They<br/>simply pushed forward. Nabiki had been ahead of them, but she had been<br/>lost a long time ago. They were simply following those that could<br/>still run blindly through the smoke.<p>"We're almost there," said Makoto firmly as she steeled her gaze.<p>"Almost where? Where the hell are we..." Rei's angry retort was<br/>cut off as her throat exploded in a spray of red.<p>"Rei?" muttered Makoto in shock as she watched her friend gurgle<br/>and fall to her knees. The girl's eyes were wide with surprise as she<br/>died.<p>Makoto fell down beside her on her knees, shaking the girl's<br/>shoulders. "Rei! No!"<p>"She's gone! Get moving!" said a firm voice from behind her as she<br/>felt some unknown soldier force her to her feet and push her forward.<br/>She stumbled blindly into the smoke in front of him, never realizing<br/>who had moved her.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo was leaning against the edge of the beach with a<br/>frown on her face. She was glancing up towards the top of the small<br/>dune that shielded her and six men from the hail of fire from above.<br/>They couldn't sit there forever, and she knew it.<p>"What should we do Ma'am?" insisted one of the men beside her.<p>She glanced at him and then back towards the bunker again. "What<br/>the hell should we do?" she muttered under her breath. Everyone was<br/>looking to her for orders; she was the highest-ranking person in the<br/>small group of men. "Shit."<p>"What's our sitrep?" she asked one of the men behind the soldier<br/>that was pressuring her for instructions.<p>"We've got about two magazines each, and no explosives," replied<br/>the man stonily.<p>"So, we can't do much at the moment," she said with her frown<br/>deepening even more. "We need some way to get into that damn machine<br/>gun bunker."<p>"We can wait for someone with grenades to make it up the beach to<br/>us?" said one of the men near the back of the group hopefully.<p>"That might not happen," said the stone-faced man calmly.<p>Nabiki frowned as she glanced between the pair, they were both<br/>right. "We can't sit here, we've got to try something. No one is going<br/>to make it up the beach until these machine guns are taken out."<p>"Well, you command, we obey," replied the stone-faced man with his<br/>chilling calm.<p>Nabiki glanced over her shoulder and cursed. "We're screwed then.<br/>Come on, the only thing I can think of is laying down some cover fire<br/>with what little ammunition we've got, and hoping one of us can make<br/>it up there and unload a clip or two through that firing hole."<p>"Hey, if it don't work, maybe someone else will make it up the<br/>beach," quipped the stone faced soldier as he cocked his weapon.<p>"Right," replied one of the other men nervously.<p>Nabiki frowned; she pointed at two men in the back and stated her<br/>orders. "You two are going to try and rush it. Stay low, find cover<br/>where you can, and don't push your luck."<p>They looked at one another and swallowed hard. Both of them knew<br/>they would probably die within the next few minutes.<p>The girl found her teeth clenching ever tighter at the looks the<br/>pair was giving her. "We'll do all we can to cover you. Get ready to<br/>run."<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Silence, sweet blissful silence. She longed to hear the sound<br/>again. Smoke rose from almost every surface, small fires crackled,<br/>burning on the remains of the uniforms and soldiers. A few pitiful<br/>moans and cries of pain could still be heard along the beach. Medical<br/>teams rushed around her as she staggered through the sand. The water<br/>was red now, dark and murky, tainted with the blood of those who<br/>hadn't made it, and probably a good bit from those who had as well.<p>The battle was over, the occasional shot, or cry of the enemy<br/>could be heard from above. Those who had made it to the top were still<br/>cleaning out the bunkers. They had only needed to secure the beach<br/>this time, destroy the defenses of the compound, and according to the<br/>orders, another unit would come in behind them to push further inside.<p>Usagi Tsukino simply stared forward with dead eyes as she watched<br/>the waves lap against the sands. She had remained on the beach,<br/>shooting so those who had rushed forward could make their way to use<br/>the grenades. Only two out of ten had made it. Despite her best<br/>efforts, she wasn't able to save them all.<p>"Usagi," said a quiet voice from behind her.<p>"Yeah, what is it?" said the girl rudely. She wondered where it<br/>had come from.<p>"Have you seen any of the others?" asked Makoto as she walked up<br/>beside the girl.<p>"No," replied the blonde simply.<p>"Rei didn't make it," said the girl as she took of her helmet and<br/>let her hair hang down. It was matted down with sweat and blood, and<br/>covered in sand.<p>"Rei?" said Usagi quietly. "That's too bad." She looked sincere<br/>about her words.<p>"That's too bad? How can you say that? She was your friend!" said<br/>Makoto with a sudden anger in her voice.<p>"Maybe she was, once," replied Usagi. "I'm alone now. You're not<br/>my friends, you're my comrades, my fellow soldiers."<p>Makoto simply stared at her for a long moment.<p>"I've learned a lot, I'm not sure what use it will be, but I know<br/>things now I wish I had never learned," replied the blonde calmly.<p>"So, you won't forgive us?" said Makoto quietly.<p>"Do you want to be forgiven?" was the only reply.<p>The pair simply stood there, watching the water after that moment<br/>for a long time.<p>After what seemed like an eternity, a new voice came up from<br/>behind them. "So, you two made it?"<p>"Yes Ma'am," said Makoto as she turned towards Nabiki. She didn't<br/>bother to salute the girl.<p>Usagi merely turned her head to acknowledge that she had been<br/>spoken too.<p>"I found Ami and Minako about a half-hour ago," said Nabiki as she<br/>staggered over to their side. She had a bad limp and a red stained<br/>bandage over her right thigh.<p>"You should get that looked at," said Makoto as she noticed it.<p>"The medics are too busy right now, it's not that bad," said<br/>Nabiki with an obvious pain in her tone.<p>"They aren't real," said Usagi as she frowned at her.<p>"No, but now you know what war is really like," said Trunks as he<br/>walked up to them and looked at the beach for a long moment.<p>"You!" snarled Nabiki hatefully.<p>"Watch your tone lieutenant."<p>"Don't you dare lieutenant me! You bastard! Why the hell did you<br/>put us through this?" screamed Nabiki in rage. She almost fell over<br/>from her injured leg as she glared at him hatefully.<p>Trunks merely turned towards her with an unreadable frown on his<br/>face. "One of you three is going to rule the entire planet one day. I<br/>think that's more than enough reason to show you what a war looks and<br/>feels like. Out of all of you, any one will have enough power to<br/>create a battle a hundred times worse, and years longer than the one<br/>you took part in today. This is just one battle, imagine what an<br/>entire war could do to the world."<p>Usagi fell silent at this and stared at the sand. "I wish I never<br/>found out."<p>"We would never do something like this!" screamed Minako.<p>"You've already proven that you can betray her," said Nabiki, as<br/>she suddenly became very calm and stared directly at the girl.<p>This caught the brunette off guard and she stared at her superior<br/>in shock. "I..."<p>"You begin to see what I mean," said Trunks as he nodded calmly.<br/>"Willing to die for her, but put in the position I had you in, you'd<br/>just as soon be rid of her. Usagi Tsukino is Sailor Moon, and the<br/>Princess you were sworn to protect."<p>"She was no better," replied Makoto in shame as she turned towards<br/>Nabiki.<p>"I was never one of you until this happened," replied the girl<br/>calmly. "You weren't my friends, I didn't even know you."<p>"If you don't want me, I'll just leave," said Usagi as she turned<br/>towards the pair. They were arguing as if she wasn't there, and it<br/>finally got to her.<p>"I'm not giving you that option," interrupted Trunks. "You'll do<br/>as your told, follow your orders, and fulfill your duties."<p>"Duties? What duties?" snapped Makoto.<p>"If you can't even do it here, what makes you think you'll be able<br/>too out there?" he replied calmly. "Like her or not, it doesn't matter<br/>to me. You're on the same side in a war, and you're going to find a<br/>way to work together. No matter how many times it kills you. It's a<br/>luxury you don't have in the real world. You can't always choose your<br/>allies, or your enemies."<p>"Where are the others?" asked Nabiki as she turned away from the<br/>conversation.<p>"In hell," replied Trunks with a small shrug. "They'll be waiting<br/>for you when you get back to the base."<p>"Hell?" muttered Usagi dumbly.<p>"Yeah, hell. I've been there a few times. Not a nice place, and I<br/>don't want you thinking that dying is a way to get out of training.<br/>You die, you go to hell and watch the others until they die and join<br/>you, or the mission is completed. It also prevents one of the down<br/>sides to VR training, losing your fear of death. I know you'll be<br/>afraid to die now, because you know what could be waiting for you on<br/>the other side." He smirked at them and turned away, walking towards<br/>the compound. "There's a transport waiting for you a few hundred yards<br/>down the beach. You'll have to wait a few hours before they'll have<br/>enough room to load you up due to the wounded. I suggest you rest up<br/>and try to relax before then. Hotaru will brief you on the next<br/>operation in the morning."<p>The trio of survivors did exactly that.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Three of them lived?" asked Hotaru as Trunks walked up beside her<br/>at the base. The transport carrying the leftover senshi hadn't arrived<br/>just yet, but those who had died were all passed out in the billets.<p>"Yes, surprised me. I wasn't expecting any of them to survive<br/>that," said Trunks calmly as he nodded at her.<p>"Well, we should move on to the next phase then."<p>"I'm not entirely comfortable with what I just did," said Trunks<br/>as he turned to look at her.<p>"What? Why?" she replied in confusion.<p>"It's not just that whiny part of me either," continued the boy as<br/>if he hadn't heard her. "I think all of us were bothered by that on<br/>some level. It wasn't really part of the training, but I think it was<br/>an important lesson."<p>Hotaru stared at him for a long moment; he was smiling rather<br/>oddly. "We are teaching them to kill you know."<p>"Yeah, I know. The missions from here on out will be a bit<br/>different though. The rest of the training will involve small group<br/>operations. Espionage, tactics and stealth, that sort of thing. That<br/>was just bloody warfare, masses of men killing, not even completely<br/>sure why they were doing it."<p>"It's a hard lesson," agreed Hotaru.<p>"You could learn it yourself," replied Trunks calmly.<p>"Genaku taught me more than enough thank you," replied the girl as<br/>she narrowed her eyes at him. "He taught me what it meant to be the<br/>Senshi of Death, they feared me anyway, so I gave them a real reason<br/>to fear me."<p>"What about rebirth?" said Trunks as he smirked at her.<p>"That lesson, was for Hotaru to show me," replied the girl calmly.<p>Trunks nodded and turned away from her. "Put them back together<br/>when they return. We leave at first light for the extended training<br/>regimen. I'll have the compound set up by then."<p>"What's the target?" asked Hotaru.<p>"I'm thinking the threat of launching thermo nuclear devices into<br/>a few continents will be enough to spur them to action."<p>"Isn't that a bit much?" asked Hotaru dumbly.<p>"Hmmm. Maybe it is, but they need to learn, that sometimes you<br/>have to act, for the greater good."<p>"You want me to brief them?"<p>"Have Nabiki do it."<p>"Right."<p>++++++++++++++<p>"What's going on here?" growled the angry looking woman that stood<br/>on the landing platform of Jurai Palace. A group of confused guards<br/>stood around her as she glanced around in irritation. She had long<br/>blonde hair and a scowl on her face as she seemed to seek something<br/>out.<p>Another goddess landed beside her, her body almost not visible by<br/>the blinding light that reflected off her dress. "She should be here,<br/>they are all together."<p>A third figure appeared a scowl on his face as he glanced at the<br/>alarmed guards in disgust. "Tsunami? This is her doing? I am most<br/>displeased with this development."<p>Another woman appeared, her skin was light blue, with a mist<br/>rising off the surface of her body. "Why has my avatar come here?"<p>The third was a more familiar looking figure, Urd appeared too the<br/>group with a worried looking frown on her face. "No! We can't be<br/>here!"<p>"Your friendship with Tsunami will not protect her from our wrath.<br/>She has overstepped her bounds," growled the male god as he glared at<br/>her for a moment.<p>"But...Tsunami..." said Urd nervously. "You mean nobody told you?"<p>The other gods were in the midst of opening a porthole and ignored<br/>her. "I have found it!" cried the male god as he ripped open a hole in<br/>the new dimension.<p>One of the female goddesses growled under her breath as she<br/>steadied the flow of time. "Idiot! You should have looked before you<br/>opened that! Do you want to destroy the entire galaxy?"<p>"Hmmm, yes," replied another god who appeared beside the first. He<br/>was wearing armor and had an amused smirk on his face.<p>"Oh boy," muttered Urd as she followed after the others.<p>The group entered a strange room, it was dark, and rows of beds<br/>could be seen along the walls. It appeared to be the middle of the<br/>night.<p>"Tsunami! I know you are here! Come out and explain yourself!"<br/>cried the male god in a booming voice that carried across the room. He<br/>paused and blinked as he realized it didn't quite have the effect he<br/>had originally planned.<p>The gods heard movement in the shadows, none of them could see<br/>very well in the darkness. Several dry clicking sounds could be heard<br/>around them and they paused and froze quite still.<p>"What is this?" grumbled the male god dumbly.<p>They were surrounded by several girls with tired looking frowns on<br/>their faces, in the space of four seconds, they had been awakened, and<br/>surrounded the intruders.<p>"Who the hell are you?" growled a feminine voice from the shadows.<p>"Foolish mortals! I am..."<p>"Dead meat," said another female voice. The sound of gunfire<br/>filled the hallway and the gods knew no more.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!" laughed Trunks as he looked at the<br/>rather pathetic looking faces of the intruders who had entered his<br/>domain.<p>"Are we where I think we are?" muttered the blonde goddess<br/>nervously.<p>"Kinda, yeah," said Urd as she smiled at her weakly. "Hi boss."<p>"Well, I'd ask you why you're all here, but I'm not done laughing<br/>at you just yet," said Trunks cheerfully as he snickered at the rather<br/>sheepish looking group in front of him.<p>"What has happened! I demand to know!" screamed the angry male<br/>god. The armored god looked rather bored at the moment at his side and<br/>had yet to speak.<p>"I haven't seen Hild yet," he muttered under his breath.<p>"Well, I'm assuming you're all gods," said Trunks as he lounged on<br/>the high throne of hell and watched them for a moment.<p>"Demon! You cannot hold us here! We'll..."<p>"Can it Zeus! That's L-sama sitting there you moron!" snapped Urd.<p>Every single one of the gods fell silent at this.<p>"Well, technically, I'm just a little piece of him. I'm actually<br/>quite mortal at the moment."<p>"Her," corrected Mars as he stared at the Lord of All.<p>"You should know better," said Trunks as he blasted the god with a<br/>small bolt of chi. Mars stood there smoking with a rather painful<br/>looking expression on his face.<p>"If I might ask..." started the cold looking goddess.<p>"Um, Urd...?" asked Trunks as he didn't recognize her.<p>"This is Shiva, all of these gods are the patrons of the Senshi,"<br/>replied the goddess with a small sigh. "Myself, Skuld, and Belldandy<br/>are all patrons of Setsuna..."<p>"Ah, I get it now," said the boy as he jumped off of his seat and<br/>walked up to them. "Well, I suppose you should explain why you're<br/>here."<p>"We came for our patrons! They had vanished off this plane of<br/>existence. Jadeite told us that they had been sent too..." started<br/>Venus nervously.<p>"This must be his idea of a joke," commented Trunks lazily as he<br/>cut the woman off. "Ah well. You'll find you're quite mortal in here.<br/>Your powers have been sealed away by the same field that keeps the<br/>senshi in check. Sort of a training device, but I digress..."<p>The gods all blinked at this.<p>"At any rate, I suppose you're wondering what they're doing here?"<p>A collective nod came from all but Urd.<p>"Well, I'm training them. I take it you're aware of the current<br/>situation on Earth?"<p>"Of course, they are needed there..." started Zeus.<p>"Yadda yadda, they'd get their asses handed too them in about two<br/>seconds," replied Trunks calmly. "I'm training em right now. We'll go<br/>back, and I'll destroy that other me. Then you can have em back."<p>Once again, the gods looked confused.<p>"Training?" prodded Mars.<p>"Yeah, pretty standard human stuff at the moment. I wasn't<br/>planning on unlocking those senshi powers of theirs for a while yet.<br/>Maybe another month or so, then I'll let them have em back."<p>"What sort of training?" said Shiva with an icy calm about her.<p>"You're an Ice goddess? Thought you were some kinda multi armed<br/>blue chick," said Trunks as he peered at her for a moment.<p>She turned her head away and blushed for a moment as she formed<br/>her other arms.<p>"Right, anyway. It's been loads of laughs watching those girls<br/>train. I have to admit, there's been some personality changes, but<br/>it's not too bad..."<p>"Personality changes?" said Venus as she arched her eyebrow at<br/>this.<p>"You'll see," replied the boy with a small shrug.<p>"What about Crystal Tokyo, our ultimate goal?" said Amaterasu<br/>irritably as she glared at Mars in disgust for a moment. The war god<br/>had a huge grin on his face as he followed after Trunks as the boy led<br/>them through a hallway in hell.<p>"Oh, that? I may decide to let them have it, if they build it<br/>themselves," he replied calmly. "No way am I gonna let some stupid<br/>crystal do all the work for em though. Perfect world indeed, who asked<br/>me permission for that monstrosity?"<p>"Monstrosity?" muttered Venus dumbly.<p>Urd winced at this. It had been Belldandy's idea actually; the<br/>others with her just seemed to like it. She had no idea why Mars had<br/>agreed to it. The guy was just weird that way she supposed, who knew<br/>what was going on inside his head.<p>"Anyway, they've made me quite proud so far. Usagi's still a bit<br/>rough, but hey! She'll pull through, she's a tough kid."<p>Venus stared at the one of the walls they had passed; scenes of<br/>the girl's training were playing all around them. "What the hell did<br/>you do to them?"<p>"Well, I've killed them a lot. That was them that shot you by the<br/>way, just so you know. Quite impressive ne?" The boy looked quite<br/>pleased with himself. "Anyway, I'm gonna need a little help once I get<br/>back. That evil me is mine, but there's gonna be a lot more than that<br/>waiting for us. So I figured since I brought them along, I might as<br/>well make use of em. This'll help em later on. Although, Usagi is<br/>worrying me a bit, she seems kinda down lately."<p>"Only you could crush a girl's spirit that much," muttered<br/>Amaterasu dumbly as she stared at her own avatars training.<p>"Hmmm, she seemed to think that her powers derived from love,<br/>rather than just pure light. Wonder how they got that idea into their<br/>heads?" muttered Trunks as he gave Venus a passing glance.<p>"Heh, heh," said the goddess nervously as she looked at the ceiling.<p>"I've got a lot of work to do with them yet. They started training<br/>in the VR environment about two months ago. Another three months of<br/>that and I was going to start retraining them as the Sailor Senshi<br/>again. Kinda odd, having that name. They aren't Sailors, never were as<br/>I recall."<p>"Well, now that we know that, we should all leave. Belldandy needs<br/>my help actually, we kinda lost Keiichi. I was gonna go up to heaven<br/>to look for leads, when I ran into these idiots and tried to stop them<br/>from coming. So, if you'll just show us the way out..."<p>"Out?" said Trunks as he looked up at her and blinked. "What do<br/>you mean you -lost- Keiichi?"<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks sat in a boardroom style area of the room. It had a long<br/>table and three walls on all sides, with one leading out to the open.<br/>The gods were sitting around him and Urd had just explained that<br/>Keiichi had been kidnapped while at work.<p>The boy hung his head and rubbed at his temples in irritation.<br/>"Well, that's definitely not good. Still, I wasn't expecting a lot of<br/>help from the gods anyway. It's most likely L-sama will tell you to<br/>stay out of the way of this one. It's sort of a personal matter<br/>really."<p>Mars frowned at this, but the others seemed to nod. Trunks<br/>suspected it was because he didn't like the idea of missing out on all<br/>the fun. Not that he was all that involved in the first place, but it<br/>was probably the principal of the matter.<p>"At any rate, I thought I'd give you the rundown of what I've been<br/>doing with the Senshi. I've got lots of film clips, made them for my<br/>own personal amusement later on really, but it's nice to know that I'm<br/>prepared." He held up several disks. "This is really just a highlights<br/>reel more than anything else. I'll show you how they're doing now<br/>after we're through."<p>"What's going on here? What are you doing to them?" muttered Shiva<br/>icily. She didn't appear to have much of a personality.<p>"Watch and see," said the boy cheerfully.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Usagi Tsukino frowned as she stared at the doorway that barred<br/>their entrance into the compound. It was a huge bay door that was<br/>raised with the help of a motor inside the building. It was also about<br/>a foot off the ground. A light snow fell all around the group of girls<br/>as they stood together on a hilltop. The guards below could be seen<br/>milling about, but hadn't noticed them.<p>They ducked behind the hill together and stared at each other.<p>"What are we gonna do?" muttered Rei irritably.<p>"We don't have any weapons, we were ordered to procure them on<br/>site," said Ami with a slight frown on her face.<p>"Nabiki?" muttered Makoto as she turned towards their silent<br/>leader.<p>"Our best bet to find weapons is to get inside unnoticed. That<br/>won't be easy with all those guards."<p>Usagi nodded at this with a frown on her face. "How do we do<br/>that?"<p>"We'll have to move in as a group," said Nabiki with a small sigh.<br/>"We'll move ahead one at a time, while the others keep track of where<br/>the guards are and when it's safe to move."<p>"Great! Let's go then!" said Usagi cheerfully. She stood up and<br/>started moving forward, only to hear a dry click under her foot. "Aw<br/>shit."<p>The rest of the team's eyes went wide as a loud boom tore across<br/>the silence. There was a flash of light and a spray of red. Usagi's<br/>body fell to the ground, with her entire left side torn to little more<br/>than a bloody pulp.<p>"Mines!" cried Rei in alarm.<p>"No duh!" snapped Minako as she growled and searched the area<br/>around her in vain. The snow hid any traces of any of the deadly<br/>devices.<p>The girls all froze in place as the sound of around twenty dry<br/>clicks sounded from the forest around them.<p>"We've been spotted!" muttered Nabiki quietly.<p>The roar of gunfire filled the forest, tearing into the girl's<br/>bodies as they fell to the ground rather quickly after the shooting<br/>started.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>"Well, that went well," said Trunks as he looked at Nabiki with a<br/>smirk on his face.<p>The girl was glaring at him angrily. There was a one-hour minimum<br/>time limit on hell, once they died; they were there for at least an<br/>hour before they were brought back. "We did what we were ordered too."<p>"Actually, you never even cleared the first objective," said<br/>Trunks as he looked down at a report of the operation that was done up<br/>by Hotaru. She had free run of the area, and did nothing more than<br/>watch them. It was her job to report back to the boy about what had<br/>taken place, even though he didn't really need it. He could watch any<br/>area from his office, or play back things that had happened at his<br/>leisure.<p>"You set us up!" snapped Nabiki.<p>"Actually, the AI did. It will actually get smarter as you<br/>progress, and it's responsible for the defense of the compound."<p>"Nabiki blinked at this."<p>"It works just like a real squad would actually. It can't make<br/>mines magically appear they have to be set. You were the ones who<br/>decided to walk into the middle of it. Not to mention, you stood on a<br/>hilltop as if no one would be looking that way. You might as well have<br/>raised a flag."<p>The girl blushed slightly at this.<p>"In any case, you failed to even enter the compound. You'll try<br/>again tomorrow. Don't expect the defenses to be the same, the interior<br/>of the building will change with each failed mission as well. I expect<br/>you to keep that between us for now, let them figure it out on their<br/>own."<p>"Change?" muttered Nabiki dumbly.<p>"Of course, you don't expect me to send them through the exact<br/>same exercise every time do you?" said the boy as he looked at her and<br/>blinked. "Mission objectives will vary as well. You might be going up<br/>against a single squad one day, and an entire army the next."<p>Nabiki nodded at this and stood up to leave. "If there's nothing<br/>else?"<p>"Dismissed," replied the boy as he chuckled at the report in his<br/>hand.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"Great job Usagi," muttered Rei as she glared at the girl cleaning<br/>her weapon on the other side of the room. She didn't know why the girl<br/>was bothering anyway; it wasn't like they were allowed to take them<br/>along on a mission yet. "She got us all killed."<p>"Stupid mines," grumbled Minako as she rubbed at her leg. She had<br/>lost it just before she died due to stumbling over one of them in her<br/>attempt to find cover. It felt strange to still have it.<p>No one spoke of the place they had been sent afterwards. The hour<br/>in hell had a sort of odd silence about it between them.<p>"We can't blame her," said Minako calmly as she glared at Rei. "We<br/>were all careless that time."<p>"She's right," agreed Makoto.<p>Ami simply stared forward at the group from her own bunk. She<br/>looked over at Usagi and then back at the others.<p>Usagi noticed this and glanced up at them, before turning her head<br/>back down to the maintenance of her weapon.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>"What's the job today?" said Nabiki as she stared at Ranma. The<br/>Senshi were all standing in a row behind her at attention.<p>"Well, I thought I'd do something a little simpler this time.<br/>Seeing as how you can't even get into a building."<p>None of the girls even flinched.<p>"Today, you're going to find me..." the boy paused and watched<br/>them for a few seconds. "A shrubbery."<p>"A what?" said Nabiki as she narrowed her eyes at him.<p>"Nii!" cried Trunks as he whirled around to face her.<p>"A shrubbery. Right," said the girl as she sighed and turned to<br/>face the others. "You heard the man, let's go find a... shrubbery."<p>"Something nice!" said Trunks as they all piled into the back of a<br/>large green truck.<p>"Right," muttered Minako as she spared him a rather weary looking<br/>glance.<p>"And not too expensive!" called the boy as Nabiki started the<br/>engine.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"Where are we going?" muttered Minako as she jumped out of the<br/>back of the vehicle.<p>"Down there," said Nabiki as she looked down at the tiny village<br/>that had somehow appeared on the road through her binoculars.<p>"Seems quiet," said Ami calmly.<p>"That's what scares me," grumbled Nabiki. She turned to look at<br/>her troops, each of them was armed. He'd even allowed Rei to bring<br/>along a rocket launcher. She didn't like the look in the girl's eyes<br/>when she held it, but it was strapped across her back and largely<br/>forgotten at the moment.<p>"We should move in," said Makoto.<p>"Right, won't do us any good to stand here," agreed Usagi.<p>"Makoto, you've got point," said Nabiki as she glanced at the<br/>girl. "This is about as close as I want to drive."<p>The girls all nodded and readied their weapons for the hike to the<br/>village. It was at least two miles away at the moment though.<p>It didn't take long before they reached the edge of the village.<br/>They moved in, hugging close to walls and hiding behind barriers.<br/>Every obstacle in their path was a potential threat, and they kept<br/>their eyes on every door and window as they moved through what<br/>appeared to be a residential area.<p>They moved silently, using hand signals and quick glances to<br/>communicate. Everything was going smoothly, just like in training as<br/>they neared the business section of the small town.<p>It was a great deal more populated as they moved into the main street<br/>area. They had seen several people watching them off their porches in<br/>confusion, but they hadn't been attacked yet.<p>Finally, after getting a large number of confused glances as the<br/>pedestrians moved out of their way. Usagi stopped as Nabiki signaled<br/>her to move forward. "What the hell am I doing?"<p>Minako, who had been squatting down beside her blinked, "Huh?"<p>Usagi shouldered her weapon and stood up, walking out into the<br/>middle of the street. Everyone tensed up nervously as they watched<br/>this. Nabiki was cursing under her breath.<p>"Usagi! What the hell are you doing?" she hissed angrily at the<br/>girl.<p>"Shopping," replied the girl with a small shrug. She turned and<br/>looked up at a sign on one of the buildings, 'Roger's Shrubbery'. With<br/>a small sigh she strolled inside and left the rest of the senshi<br/>staring at her dumbly.<p>About ten minutes later she came out holding a shrub in her arms.<br/>"Okay. We can go back now." She turned and started walking down the<br/>street, noting that the others were still hiding behind cars and<br/>forcing people to give them a rather wide area of clearance.<p>"What the?" muttered Minako in shock.<p>"This seems too easy," said Ami as she narrowed her eyes and<br/>glanced around.<p>"Maybe that's just it?" said Makoto as she looked at her.<p>"You mean...there's no hostels here?" said the girl as she<br/>returned the brunette's stare with a sort of blank frown.<p>"I don't think so," said Nabiki as she appeared over them, walking<br/>out in the open. "He's just messing with our heads again."<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>"Great! You got it!" said Trunks as he accepted the plant from the<br/>girl. "Thanks."<p>"We've completed a mission?" said Makoto with a sort of proud<br/>smile on her face.<p>"That's right," said Nabiki as she looked at her and smirked. "I<br/>think that deserves something."<p>"You're right. I'll give you a little extra time off tonight,"<br/>said Trunks cheerfully. "Just don't expect it too much."<p>"Right," grumbled Minako.<p>"But first..." said Trunks with a wide grin on his face.<p>The girls all groaned.<p>"You must fetch me..." he paused to soak up their misery for a<br/>moment. "Another shrubbery!"<p>"What?" said Nabiki as she stared at him.<p>"Yes. We'll put one slightly higher than the other, so it forms a<br/>little path down the middle."<p>"We could have just gotten two while we were there the first<br/>time!" snapped Minako.<p>"This is how we do things in the military," snorted the boy as he<br/>frowned at her. "Plus, after you've done that, you must cut down the<br/>mightiest tree in that forest." He pointed at a nearby patch of woods.<br/>They were about to voice a protest when he spoke up again. "Wiiiittth,<br/>a herring!" He held up a small fish.<p>"We most certainly will not!" snapped Nabiki.<p>"Oh come on, please?" said Trunks as he grinned at her.<p>The girl blinked as if she suddenly realized this was some kind of<br/>joke she just didn't get.<p>"Ah well. Enjoy your time off ladies," said Trunks as he turned<br/>away from them. "Just be back and ready to go back to work by sunrise<br/>tomorrow. That means well rested, so be sure to get some sleep."<p>There was a resounding cheer from the group as they immediately<br/>rushed away.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>The next day, the girls all returned at a reasonable hour much to<br/>the boy's surprise. They had returned to the town and spent much of<br/>the day there, shopping, or eating. They actually had a paycheck,<br/>which surprised them when Nabiki informed them.<p>Trunks appeared at sunrise, just as promised. He had a grin on his<br/>face as he strolled into the room. "Welcome back ladies, time to go<br/>back to work."<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Usagi! On top of the tower!" screamed Nabiki as she kept her<br/>hands stuck on Minako's throat as blood oozed between her fingers. The<br/>girl's eyes were wide, and she had a desperate expression on her face<br/>as she tried to breathe. Nabiki's expression was frustrated and almost<br/>panicking. She kept herself under control though, and noticed the<br/>flash of a lens in the large tower about a hundred yards away from<br/>their position.<p>The blonde girl nodded grimly, knowing that Minako's fate was<br/>practically sealed. The girl would soon be suffering in that horrible<br/>place again. She raised her rifle up to bear and frowned deeply as she<br/>pressed the sight up against her eye.<p>Rei watched calmly from her position next to Ami against a<br/>shattered looking brick wall. Her face was frozen in a dead state; it<br/>took Ami a moment to realize that Rei wasn't watching at all. She<br/>wasn't there anymore.<p>"No!" muttered the girl in horror as she stared into her friend's<br/>dead eyes. "No! No! Don't leave me here Rei!" she muttered in horror.<br/>"Damn it...I...I can't..."<p>Usagi took the shot, it was clean and she saw the tiny silhouette<br/>fall away as the bullet struck home. "I got him!" she cried in<br/>triumph. Her cheer was short lived as her brain splattered across the<br/>ground a moment later from another sniper on a rooftop nearby.<p>Nabiki looked on, still clutching Minako's throat wound, despite<br/>the fact that the girl had already moved on. Ami was breaking down,<br/>and Makoto was pinned on the other side of the large open field in the<br/>center of the complex by a group of machine gun toting soldiers that<br/>were just out of sight of her position. "Shit. Shit! Shit!" she<br/>muttered as a hail of bullets tore up the ground around her.<p>She dove down beside Ami; the girl was crying and clutching her<br/>head in horrified fear. "Damn it! Snap out of it! You're all I've got<br/>right now!" Without bothering to do any more than that to check on the<br/>girl, she glanced at Rei to find out where the shot she had been hit<br/>with came from.<p>Nabiki gasped as she realized that the wound was on the front of<br/>the girl's chest. That wasn't good, considering that she was facing<br/>the same direction they were. "Crap."<p>A trail of smoke followed the rocket that blasted towards them.<br/>She never even saw who had fired it.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Makoto wanted to scream, she wanted to blast everything within a<br/>mile of her position with everything she had, unfortunately, she had<br/>nothing but an M-16, and two clips of ammunition. Her senshi powers<br/>had been gone for some time, and she had used all her grenades in<br/>earlier attempts to move from her current position.<p>"Damn. Where the hell is everyone else?" she muttered angrily.<br/>With a grunt of effort she hefted her weapon and fired it as one of<br/>the soldiers exposed himself slightly. She missed, but the fire<br/>pinning her down died down for a moment. "Shit. I think I'm all that's<br/>left!" she grumbled in frustration. "What the hell do I do now?"<p>Just as the words escaped her mouth her blood ran cold at the<br/>sound that rumbled from around the corner. She'd only heard it a few<br/>times during her training, but it was distinctive none the less.<br/>"Shit."<p>A huge tank rolled around the corner and stopped as it became<br/>fully visible. The turret slowly turned towards her and she tensed her<br/>body. "No way! I am not goin back to that place again!" She pulled<br/>herself to her feet in a sheer display of will and forced herself to<br/>run, despite the numbness in her legs. Bullets shattered the ground at<br/>her feet as she charged away, and a massive shower of dirt flew into<br/>the air from when the tank's shell blasted the area she had been lying<br/>on away.<p>She screamed and cursed as she dove back into the complex. The<br/>warm air hitting her skin and creating a maddening itch all across her<br/>skin as she continued to run forward. "Damn! Damn! Damn!" she screamed<br/>in frustration as the sounds of soldiers charging in behind her seemed<br/>to haunt her every step. She ducked behind a wall as a bullet cracked<br/>the concrete surface of the large warehouse style interior. There were<br/>a lot of boxes lying around, and the bodies of those they had killed<br/>in their entrance were still hidden away behind some of them.<p>She stopped cold as she found the hallway she and the others had<br/>entered through. "Oh no."<p>Ami had mined the hallway, to stop someone from sneaking in after<br/>them and taking them by surprise. She couldn't see the lasers, but she<br/>knew they were there, and could see some of the carefully hidden<br/>explosives if she looked hard enough. Not that she had time to find<br/>them. "What the hell?" she grumbled in frustration as she glanced<br/>around for some kind of escape. She could probably hide in the maze of<br/>boxes. The game of cat and mouse would end soon enough though, and she<br/>would be on the bad end of that deal.<p>She turned as the sound of the soldiers rushing after her grew<br/>ever closer. "Damn!" Makoto fell to her knees and started to sob,<br/>knowing that there was nothing she could do. That was when her eyes<br/>fell on the small grate in the wall. "What the?" She raised her weapon<br/>and fired into the thin metal that blocked the airshaft.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks smiled as Minako sat before him with a pensive looking<br/>frown on her face. She knew she was in trouble.<p>The boy shuffled some papers on his desk and sighed. "I really<br/>wish you idiots had figured out that you can run when you have too<br/>sooner. I was getting tired of sending you all to hell every time you<br/>went up there."<p>The girl blinked. She had her arm in a sling, and several nasty<br/>looking cuts. After the blast in the hallway took out a majority of<br/>her pursuers she didn't have much trouble picking the rest off after<br/>crawling through the shaft and into the next room before they reached<br/>it. She didn't dare continue forward, knowing she'd die if she did and<br/>came back with her head hung low. "What?"<p>"You're starting to think outside the rest of the group. I like<br/>that. Using that airshaft was a good idea. Every time you've gone up<br/>there, you've walked through the front door, shooting anything that<br/>moves to clear your way. You're the first one to come back alive, even<br/>though you didn't fulfill any of your mission objectives."<p>"I was outnumbered! I couldn't win!" she snapped.<p>"I suppose so," replied Trunks calmly. "It's a matter of stealth<br/>and tactics. You idiots are rushing that damn place like you're in the<br/>Marines or something."<p>Makoto simply stared at him in shock.<p>"There are some missions you won't be able to turn back from, no<br/>matter how bad it gets. Some of them you can retreat from if need be,<br/>or simply fall back to a safer position and try again later. I'm going<br/>to have a talk with Nabiki about her forward only tactics. It's<br/>admirable, but not really practical."<p>"If this is her fault, why is she leading us?" grumbled Makoto<br/>sourly.<p>"Because she's smarter than you, she just has to learn to apply<br/>these kinds of situations."<p>"By getting us all killed?" growled the girl angrily.<p>"At least you come back here," replied Trunks with a dark frown of<br/>his own. "That's a luxury you don't have outside this room."<p>"That place you send us might not be so bad after a while," she<br/>grumbled.<p>"Heh, the stronger you become, and the more used to it you get,<br/>the worse it will become," he replied calmly. "Don't forget that<br/>Makoto."<p>The girl swallowed and stared at him numbly for a moment.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>The others had returned once Makoto had set foot on the base.<br/>Trunks had debriefed them all with Makoto being the last of them. They<br/>had learned something new that day; the suffering ended once those who<br/>didn't die came back from a mission. It didn't matter whether the hour<br/>was up or not.<p>Trunks had also made it clear that it wouldn't be the case on all<br/>of the missions either. Some had to be completed, or failed completely<br/>for them to return. They weren't anywhere near that level just yet<br/>though.<p>Usagi was being rather silent as usual, keeping to herself and<br/>cleaning her gear.<p>Ami was the focus of the rest of the room though. She was a pale<br/>white, and held her knees while shivering in terror. She hadn't spoken<br/>since she had awoken from death.<p>"Ami? Are you all right?" muttered Rei as she moved up to the girl<br/>carefully.<p>Makoto was quickly by her side, staring fearfully at the girl. "Is<br/>she sick?"<p>"She's in shock!" cried Rei.<p>Hotaru frowned as she strolled into the room and looked at Ami for<br/>a moment, shoving the others aside and grasping the girl by her<br/>shoulders. "Something...is..."<p>Ami screamed; it was a painful wail as she simply looked up and<br/>cried out at the top of her voice.<p>Usagi jumped up from her place and rushed over to the scene, the<br/>others stepped back with shocked looks on their faces.<p>Everything had come down on the girl at once. Fear, anger,<br/>frustration, the faces of those she'd killed, and those she'd seen<br/>die. Her eyes rolled up and she slumped down onto the mattress<br/>unconscious.<p>No one had a clue what to do. Hotaru gave her a worried looking<br/>frown and stood up.<p>Usagi shook her head and walked away with tears flowing down her<br/>cheeks. "Oh Ami..."<p>"What do you care?" snapped Rei angrily.<p>Usagi simply looked at her with an unreadable expression on her<br/>face. "I may not like any of you anymore, but I will always care."<p>Rei reacted as if she had been physically slapped. Her jaw dropped<br/>and she stepped away from the girl. "Wha?"<p>Hotaru was kneeling at Ami's side with what looked like a small<br/>wrist mounted computer. She was frowning in confusion as she peered<br/>into it. "She seems fine. She's sleeping quite peacefully."<p>Makoto looked at the woman in confusion. "But...you saw what just<br/>happened to her! What the hell was that?"<p>"Don't tell me that was nothing!" cried Rei.<p>Usagi's face flashed with something none of the others could<br/>place, but it was dangerously familiar to them all. They all felt<br/>ashamed at the sight of it, but couldn't quite place why. "That sound,<br/>was the death of a soul. Ami will not be the same when she wakes up<br/>again. She will never be the same." The girl turned away and moved<br/>over to her bunk.<p>Trunks was standing in the back of the room unnoticed. He frowned<br/>deeply at what had just happened, and what Usagi said chilled him to<br/>the bone. "What did we just do to that girl?"<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ami Mizuno woke up the next morning. She sat upright and glanced<br/>around at everyone surrounding her. They were getting dressed and she<br/>stared at them all for a moment before standing up and moving to her<br/>locker.<p>"Oh! Ami!" gasped Makoto. "You shouldn't be up. You've got the day<br/>off today!"<p>The girl blinked at this. "Why? I am not injured or sick."<p>Makoto stared at her for a moment. "Well, you don't have to come<br/>today. You should just stay here and rest up."<p>"I see no reason for that," replied the girl as she opened her<br/>locker and started to shuffle around inside.<p>Nabiki watched her carefully from the other side of the room. She<br/>didn't interfere and watched the girl put on her gear. "Something is<br/>up."<p>Ami was the first one done, despite the fact that the others had<br/>all started before her. She walked outside and waited in her place for<br/>the others to form up to receive their orders for the day.<p>Nabiki strolled out of the building and frowned at them all.<br/>"Today is pretty normal. Our objective is to find a disk. It's encoded<br/>and we have to use the computers in the complex to decode it before it<br/>can be of any use to us. Intelligence tells us that the room we need<br/>to find is on the second floor. The disk is probably in the possession<br/>of this man." Nabiki pulled out a photo of an older looking soldier;<br/>he had a buzz cut and a gruff expression on his face. "He'll be<br/>commanding the men we'll be facing today."<p>There were muttered grumbles from within the group. Ami said<br/>nothing and simply watched.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>They were being driven to a point where they could proceed on<br/>foot. The entire squad of girls was huddled in the back of a green<br/>military transport truck. There was about a foot of snow outside, and<br/>the green cloth covering did little to protect them from the elements.<p>There was a large amount of silence within the group. Makoto would<br/>occasionally try to start small talk with Ami or Rei, but neither was<br/>receptive. It was a grim scene for all involved.<p>It was somewhat of a surprise to everyone when Ami stood up and<br/>walked over to Nabiki. Their attention was quickly elsewhere as the<br/>girl leveled a stare at Usagi that no one could read.<p>"Did you want something Mizuno?" grumbled Nabiki gruffly. She had<br/>a cup of coffee in her hands and a rather sour looking frown. She<br/>still wasn't a morning person, and the girls largely avoided her when<br/>it was as early as it was.<p>"Permission to speak, Ma am?"<p>This caught Nabiki off guard and she stared at the girl for a<br/>moment. "Um. Granted..."<p>"This mission requires stealth, we should eliminate Tsukino before<br/>we go in. She will endanger the mission."<p>"What?" muttered Nabiki in shock. "What do you mean eliminate?"<br/>growled Nabiki quietly.<p>Ami noticed that Rei had overheard her, but no one else could over<br/>the roar of the diesel engine. The black haired girl sucked in a quick<br/>breath and her eyes went wide. She didn't speak or move and waited<br/>silently for either one of them to continue.<p>"Tsukino is an excellent shot, but she is clumsy and loud. She<br/>will threaten the mission, and our lives. We should eliminate her<br/>before the mission begins. It will give us a much greater chance for<br/>success."<p>"You're not being very clear, Mizuno," grumbled Nabiki with a<br/>tense tone. "What do you mean 'eliminate'?"<p>"Forgive me, I thought my meaning was clear. I will shoot her,"<br/>replied Ami calmly.<p>Neither Rei nor Nabiki spoke for a moment. Rei wasn't sure if she<br/>thought it was a good idea, or if she was afraid that Nabiki actually<br/>seemed to be considering it.<p>"Mizuno, if you ever even suggest something like that to me again,<br/>I will..." Nabiki thought for a moment. What kind of leverage did she<br/>have over them really? "I will..." She couldn't think of anything more<br/>than a little extra exercise. Finally she turned her head away in<br/>shame. "Trunks will not be pleased to hear this. I'm sure he can find<br/>an interesting way of punishing you if you try it."<p>Ami merely nodded at this. "Understood." She stood up and returned<br/>to her seat. Rei stared at her with wide eyes and a horrified<br/>expression for a moment. The others were confused, but Ami merely sat<br/>back and closed her eyes to wait for the ride to finish.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Ami found herself in a storeroom with Usagi about five hours<br/>later. The soldiers inside were alert to the group's presence in the<br/>building, but didn't have any clear idea where they were exactly.<br/>Makoto and Minako were gone; Nabiki and Rei were on the lower level<br/>searching for the computer.<p>Ami stared through an air vent into a large warehouse like room<br/>below. It was clear of boxes and a group of soldiers were standing in<br/>front of the old soldier holding the disk.<p>"There is the target," said Ami calmly.<p>Usagi looked up at the girl. She was standing on top of several<br/>boxes to look inside the next room. "What?"<p>"I've found him," replied Ami calmly. "There are five others with<br/>him, he appears to be briefing them on something. Probably<br/>coordinating the search for us."<p>The blonde nodded seriously at this. "What can we do?"<p>Ami turned to look at her with a cold expression on her face. The<br/>only one she'd had since she'd woken up. "You will remain here and<br/>cover me through this vent. I will go and retrieve the disk. Take out<br/>the target first, and then eliminate the others with him. I will clean<br/>up what remains while I retrieve the disk."<p>"Then what?" muttered Usagi fearfully.<p>"Then we will contact Lieutenant Tendo, and wait until they find<br/>their objective. We will then take the disk to them for decoding."<p>Usagi nodded at this numbly and shivered. She clumsily mounted the<br/>boxes and climbed up to her firing position while Ami moved towards<br/>the door.<p>"Wait thirty seconds and begin. If he starts to move out of range,<br/>take the shot anyway. Don't miss."<p>The blonde nodded at this and swallowed. "A...all right."<p>Ami left her alone and moved into the hallway that connected the<br/>room to the warehouse. She moved along the wall and peered around the<br/>corner that would lead her into the room carefully. Finding no<br/>opposition, she slowly stalked forward with her weapon held ready.<br/>"Three, two, one..."<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Usagi looked into the sight of her rifle. It was a bolt action<br/>forty five millimeter sniper rifle. The crosshairs trembled as she<br/>placed them over the man's chest and slowed her breathing. A cold<br/>sweat formed on her forehead as she counted down. "Three, two, one..."<p>A crack echoed through the room. The man fell face first on the<br/>ground and a feminine scream filled the air as the men all hit the<br/>ground and pulled their own weapons to the ready.<p>"Daddy!" cried a voice. A girl of about ten rushed up from an area<br/>the girls couldn't see and ran to the man's body. One of the soldiers<br/>grabbed her around her waist and pulled her down with him as he<br/>scrambled for cover. The room was mostly empty, but there were a few<br/>boxes that could be used.<p>Usagi was frozen in horror. The little girl's face burned into her<br/>mind as she saw the tears flowing down her cheeks. "Oh no! What have I<br/>done?" she muttered to herself. She slowly lowered her weapon and<br/>simply looked at the scene for a moment. "What have I..."<p>"The air shaft!" cried one of the soldiers as he pointed towards<br/>her position.<p>She didn't even realize that she had done it. The only thing she<br/>remembered was pulling the rifle away from her face and staring at the<br/>smoking barrel for a moment. "I...I'm sorry..." She set herself again<br/>and waited for one of the men to reveal enough for a clean shot.<p>She didn't even take the time to realize that she had no tears in<br/>her eyes.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Ami stared forward as the second man fell. She could see two of<br/>the others, but it was painfully clear that she'd misjudged the number<br/>of people in the room. Her objective was down, and lying in the middle<br/>of the room face down. Simply rushing towards him would get her<br/>killed, and she knew it. With a small sigh she pulled her M-16 up to<br/>bear and switched it to burst fire.<p>The two men never knew what hit them, with a single squeeze of the<br/>trigger, she managed to them down. There was at least one more that<br/>she couldn't see. She glanced back behind her. She briefly wondered if<br/>she could trust Usagi that much.<p>She rushed forward towards the target.<p>Turning as she ran she found the fifth soldier. There were what<br/>appeared to be several civilians standing along the wall. One of them<br/>was a woman with tears in her eyes, and the others simply looked<br/>afraid. She brought her weapon up as the soldier started to react to<br/>her. He was still hidden from Usagi's line of fire. He was also<br/>holding a little girl in his arms.<p>Ami paused, she gasped as she noticed it and faltered on the<br/>trigger.<p>Unfortunately, the soldier didn't. She felt a painful force slam<br/>into her gut. It was the first time she had such a wound; it burned<br/>badly and almost knocked her off of her feet.<p>She grit her teeth and grunted in pain and anger. Bringing herself<br/>up to bear, she twisted and fired her weapon. The man fell to the<br/>ground and fired off a few more rounds as he died. The hit the ceiling<br/>as he slammed into the ground, the little girl was dead, but she had<br/>unwittingly shielded him from the bullets.<p>Ami frowned at this, and staggered forward as he groaned in pain.<br/>She stared at her for a moment down the barrel of her rifle. With a<br/>rough snort, she shot the man in his chest, silencing him completely.<p>The people along the wall gasped in shock and horror as she<br/>trained her weapon on them. The woman was screaming now, and had<br/>fallen to her knees. The girl was probably her daughter.<p>"This isn't real," muttered Ami to herself as she staggered over<br/>to the target. She kept the weapon trained on them the whole time and<br/>kneeled down to inspect him. It took about a second to search through<br/>his pockets and find the disk. Her arm was growing weary, and she<br/>could feel the blood flowing from her open wound. "Damn. I've almost<br/>finished!" she muttered as she struggled to keep herself from<br/>collapsing.<p>Finally, she struggled to her feet and slowly moved back across<br/>the room. She walked over to the wall and leaned against it just under<br/>the air grate where Usagi was still watching.<p>Ami found herself smirking despite it all; she could hear the<br/>girl's sobs from above her. She held up the disk and slid it between<br/>the grate. "Take it, finish this damn it."<p>"But...you're..."<p>"Already dead. Get the hell out of here. I'll see you when you get<br/>back," muttered the girl as she coughed and glared at the people as<br/>they cowered away from her. She was between them and the exit.<br/>"There'll be more in a few minutes. Get going!"<p>"I won't leave you!" cried Usagi. Ami couldn't see her, but oddly<br/>enough, she could imagine the look on her face.<p>"Don't make this for nothing," growled the girl as she stared at<br/>the teary eyed woman. She was still sobbing, and didn't look like she<br/>would recover any time soon. Those with her held her back forcefully,<br/>fearing what might happen if she ran to her daughter's body.<p>"You killed that girl..." muttered Usagi as her voice became<br/>clearer suddenly.<p>"Go, or I'll kill you as well," growled Ami weakly. She didn't<br/>even have the strength left to hold her weapon upright. She closed her<br/>eyes and listened. There was no sound; she wasn't sure if it was just<br/>the blood loss, or if Usagi had actually managed to leave that<br/>quietly. "Guess I'll never know..." she said calmly as her head<br/>drooped down.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Enough!" cried Urd as she stood up with tears in her eyes. "I've<br/>seen enough..."<p>The images stopped playing suddenly, pausing on that scene. The<br/>gods were sitting around the table with Trunks at the head. Each of<br/>their faces was lit up by a different colored light that shined up<br/>from the edge of the table in front of them. The boy had his hands<br/>folded in front of his face; he was wearing white gloves, and a pair<br/>of lightly tinted sunglasses. He smirked at them from behind his hands<br/>and said nothing.<p>"Not very pleasant is it?" said Venus quietly.<p>"No, it is not," said Amaterasu. She looked only slightly upset<br/>really.<p>Mars snorted and looked rather pleased. Shiva merely nodded her<br/>head and said nothing, and Zeus muttered to himself for a moment<br/>before looking at Trunks. "Did they complete the objective?"<p>The boy arched his eyebrow at this; he pushed his glasses up his<br/>nose as he started to speak. "No, but they came very close. Nabiki<br/>didn't manage to escape with the disk. They had it decoded, and she<br/>was almost out though."<p>"My avatar seems to be making progress rather well," noted Shiva.<p>"She was the most changed," agreed Trunks with an uncertain frown<br/>on his face. "I'd have to say Usagi would be second in that category."<p>"I do not know what to think about what you have done to Usagi,"<br/>said Amaterasu calmly.<p>"What have you done to them?" cried Venus in horror.<p>"Seems like he's preparing them for a war," commented Mars.<p>"Yes, I do not agree with some of this, but I admit it is rather<br/>effective," agreed Zeus.<p>"In any case, even if I win, they will still have to face Mistress<br/>Nine, possibly the Dark Moon Family although I doubt that one will<br/>come into play, and Galaxia," said Trunks with a serious looking nod.<br/>"I still have my doubts on whether or not they can take on Galaxia<br/>alone, but they'll have help if everything goes well."<p>The gods all looked at him for a moment and said nothing.<p>"At any rate, shall we go see how they are progressing now? What<br/>you just saw was a compilation of several weeks actually. They are<br/>much improved at this point. It's almost time."<p>"Almost time for what? I thought you said they had another six<br/>months!" cried Urd.<p>"Why, it's almost time for me to give them back their powers. I'm<br/>almost glad you guys came along actually." He grinned at them all<br/>widely. "I was planning on synthesizing them after I shut down the<br/>barriers that hold them in check. Yggdrasil is strong enough to enter<br/>this dimension on it's own, but your powers would have still been<br/>blocked. They probably would have lost their powers anyway because of<br/>that, but I didn't want them clinging to any residual power that might<br/>have been left behind." The boy steepled his fingers and glared down<br/>at all of them. "However, I think I'll wait a day or two for that.<br/>They'll need a bit of time to adjust to having them back as well."<p>Urd nodded at this and seemed slightly relieved. "Why train them<br/>like this then?"<p>"So they don't have to rely on their powers," replied Trunks.<br/>"Also, so they understand what real combat is. I couldn't train them<br/>as martial artists, because they just don't have the ability to meet<br/>the levels they'd need to in order to fight what they'll be against.<br/>This was the next best thing I could think of." The boy paused to<br/>smile at them all in a somewhat unfriendly fashion. "In any case, I'm<br/>sure you're eager to see the results. Shall we?"<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Rei frowned as she glared down between the grates at the scene<br/>below her. There were several dozen people tied up in the room, with<br/>about four guards posted among them. "Usagi, you in place yet?" she<br/>said quietly into the tiny microphone that curled down from her ear.<p>"Almost," replied the girl on the other end. Ami and Makoto aren't<br/>in position yet either.<p>"Ami?" muttered Rei. She almost gasped.<p>"We ran into some resistance," commented the girl coolly. "We're<br/>in position now though."<p>"Cut down the chatter ladies, I want radio silence. We may be<br/>scrambled, but that doesn't mean someone can't break in," said<br/>Nabiki's voice. "As for this operation, you may fire when ready<br/>ladies."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Various muffled screams erupted from the hostages as a pair of<br/>female soldiers burst down from the air vents above them. They were<br/>dangling from their feet by a thin chord of black rope and had a pair<br/>of sub machine guns in each hand.<p>The shocked guards didn't have time to react as they spun in the<br/>air and blasted everything that wasn't sitting. Unfortunately, that<br/>meant one or two of the hostages as well.<p>Three more of the female soldiers burst into the room from<br/>opposite sides and performed a clean sweep of the interior. The first<br/>two landed on the ground and quickly replaced their weapons with<br/>assault rifles after removing their masks to reveal long blonde hair<br/>that was tied up in a bun on each of them.<p>"Rei," said Ami as she pulled off her mask as well. The two<br/>blondes were forcing those near the wall to move back, shoving them<br/>aside almost carelessly.<p>The girl smirked and leveled a grenade launcher at one of the<br/>walls. "Instant exit, coming up." The room filled with shards of<br/>cement and a thick cloud of dust.<p>Outside, after the dust cleared, a huge half-track truck waited<br/>for them. Nabiki opened the door as the girls paused at the sight of<br/>the machineguns that were pointed at them. "It's all I could scavenge.<br/>Shut up and load them up! I want to be gone before they can react."<p>"Rei, did you disable their transportation?" said Ami coolly as<br/>she strolled by the girl.<p>"Huh? Oh yeah," said the girl as she waved off the comment.<br/>"Taking care of it now." She pulled out a small remote and pressed the<br/>single button on it after flicking a toggle switch on the side.<br/>"Done."<p>The confused looking hostages screamed in terror as the sound of<br/>an explosion a short distance away shook the building and caused a<br/>shower of dust to fall on them from above.<p>"Move it ladies!" snapped Nabiki sharply.<p>"She is correct, the mission is not yet completed," agreed Ami.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>That night, there was a large party going on at the tavern in the<br/>small town that Trunks had created for their off time.<p>"Hey Larry! Another round!" cried Makoto as she slapped Rei on the<br/>back and called to the bartender.<p>The man grinned at the call and began to fill up several mugs.<p>Ami was sitting quietly beside Usagi, neither one appeared all<br/>that interested in the other. The shorthaired girl had her eyes closed<br/>and was leaning back in her chair, simply listening to the sounds<br/>around her. The blonde was playing with a knife that was stuck into<br/>the table casually. She seemed happy, but distant.<p>"Well, hello ladies," said a voice that made the whole bar go<br/>silent.<p>"Sir!" barked the girls as they jumped to their feet and saluted<br/>Trunks.<p>The boy chuckled at this and strolled inside. "Relax, you're off<br/>for the night. I don't have anything new for ya." He sat down at the<br/>table they had for themselves and grinned. "I do have some news for<br/>ya."<p>"What's that?" said Nabiki a little sourly.<p>"Yes, tell us," said Usagi with a cheerful smile.<p>"It's not something bad either," grumbled Trunks as he looked away<br/>from them. "Jeez, even I give you good news sometimes."<p>"Yes, but not usually," commented Nabiki coolly.<p>"All right. Fine, here you go." The boy placed several familiar<br/>looking pens on the table, and a brooch.<p>"These are..." muttered Rei dumbly.<p>"Our transformation pens," said Minako in shock. A broad<br/>shouldered man was acting as her chair, and she had her hands around<br/>his neck. She had looked quite happy until Trunks had walked into the<br/>room.<p>He glanced at her for a moment and frowned. "Um, you do realize<br/>he's not real. Right?"<p>"Yeah? So?" said the girl as she blinked at him, her attention<br/>away from the pens on the table.<p>"What good do these do us?" muttered Rei.<p>Trunks almost slapped her. "Don't be stupid! You've got your<br/>powers back of course!"<p>Usagi simply stared at him for a moment. "What?"<p>"You can become Sailor Moon again starting tomorrow. The exercises<br/>will start being tailored for it actually. You'll need them."<p>"That's nice, but what good does that do me?" grumbled Nabiki<br/>sourly. She had no desire to become one of the senshi, but she did<br/>feel a slight dread creep up to her. She didn't want to be alone<br/>again."<p>"Oh, that. Well, it's pretty simple really. When was the last time<br/>you saw more than a little combat anyway? You're an officer and<br/>they're the grunts. Do your job like always."<p>Nabiki blinked at this. "What?"<p>"You've always been more of a supporting role in combat situations<br/>Nabiki. You give orders and plan things, they follow the orders.<br/>Nothing's changed; you've just got stronger weapons at your disposal<br/>so to speak. All I ever really do is give you objectives, how you meet<br/>them is your problem."<p>"Oh," said the girl as she realized what he had said was mostly<br/>true.<p>"Well, enjoy the rest of your evening off ladies," said the boy as<br/>he stood up and left them to their party.<p>Once he left the door he paused and glanced over his shoulder.<br/>"Wonder how long it'll take them too..."<p>A multicolored flash of light shined through the window for a few<br/>seconds. The boy smirked to himself and shook his head as he walked<br/>away. Various shouts of joy from the senshi could be heard from<br/>within.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>The next day...<p>"I am Sailor Moon! On behalf of the Moon! I shall punish you!"<p>"There they are!"<p>Boom.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>"What the hell were you thinking?" said Trunks lamely as he stared<br/>at the girls as they hung their heads in shame and looked at him<br/>rather pathetically.<p>"Well, it always worked before," muttered Minako.<p>Trunks slapped himself in the face in frustration. "All that<br/>training, and you blow your first outing with your powers because<br/>you're too stupid to remember that standing on rooftops and spouting<br/>poetry makes you a target?"<p>Ami frowned at that. The boy was right; she hadn't posed with the<br/>others, and had been too surprised to really react once Usagi started<br/>her usual routine. Nabiki had been the only one to survive that<br/>encounter, and she was still limping from the wound.<p>"Jeezus! You'd think people who have seen their own intestines<br/>before would know better than to pull crap like this!" cried Trunks as<br/>he glared at Usagi.<p>The girls all went slightly green at the mention of this. They had<br/>all been in that position at least once during the past several<br/>months. It was not a pleasant memory.<p>"At any rate, tomorrow you go back again!" snapped Trunks.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Usagi frowned as she glared at the thing standing over the town.<br/>She wasn't sure how long it had been since they started training with<br/>their powers, but things hadn't gotten any easier for them since that<br/>day.<p>At the moment, they were fighting what appeared to be a three<br/>hundred foot long giant lobster.<p>"Tsukino! Pay attention!" snapped Nabiki from her headset.<p>"Right!" muttered the girl as she focused her power into her<br/>palms. It was a ball of white light.<p>"How much longer?" growled Makoto as she moved up beside the girl.<br/>She was holding a bolt of lightning in her hand with a sour looking<br/>frown on her face. The electricity moved and writhed in her grip, but<br/>still retained a spear like shape despite it.<p>"It's too big, and that damn armor isn't denting," commented Rei<br/>from the headsets.<p>She was down on the ground directly in front of the creature. It<br/>lumbered forward. The girl jumped back to avoid one of its claws and<br/>growled in anger. "Mars Fire Cannon!" cried the girl as she dropped to<br/>one knee and positioned her arms as if she was firing a rocket<br/>launcher. Flames burst to life in her grip, taking the shape of a<br/>rather large version of such a weapon. With a resounding boom, a huge<br/>ball of flame shot from the barrel of the fire weapon and slammed into<br/>the thing's armored hide. It covered the monster completely, but did<br/>no real damage. The monster was slightly irritated by this, and<br/>continued to lumber after her.<p>"We are set," said Ami's voice. "Mars, do you almost have it in<br/>position?"<p>"Why do I have to be the bait!" cried the girl in frustration as<br/>she dodged again.<p>"Because, you're the only one who can irritate it enough to make<br/>it follow you," replied Nabiki calmly.<p>"Damn," grumbled the girl as she rushed across a bridge that ran<br/>across a rather large river. The monster followed after her as she<br/>pelted it with small fireballs, egging it on and keeping it angry<br/>enough to follow after her.<p>The bridge groaned under the weight of the monster as it crawled<br/>onto it, it crushed the concrete easily under its claws as it rumbled<br/>across and it was clear that the structure would not hold.<p>The other senshi were all standing on the other side of the river<br/>at this point, having moved together from wherever their hiding places<br/>had been before, waiting patiently. Finally, the monster was in<br/>position.<p>"It's all the way on the bridge. Go!" cried Nabiki. She wasn't<br/>with them at the moment, and was watching over from a small mobile<br/>command center.<p>Ami pressed a small detonating switch and the remains of the<br/>bridge exploded, sending the monster into the river with a mighty<br/>splash.<p>"Hino! Kino! Do it now!"<p>The pair nodded and jumped into the air.<p>"Jupiter Thunder Storm!"<p>"Mars Fire Cannon Barrage!"<p>Hundreds of fireballs and dozens of lighting bolts slammed into<br/>the water from the sky. The water glowed orange for a moment beneath<br/>the surface and started to boil instantly, then there was a red flash<br/>of light and a huge boom tore through the air, shattering every window<br/>in the small town in its wake. A huge cloud of steam rose into the<br/>air from the now dry riverbed.<p>Ami stared at it with a pair of goggles that allowed her to see<br/>through the thick cloud. She saw a giant dead youma at the bottom of<br/>the riverbed. "Mission complete."<p>"All right! Giant steamed lobster!" cried Makoto.<p>Usagi gave out a sigh of relief. Even if the tactic hadn't worked<br/>and killed it, they would have lured it away from the town at least.<br/>That would have made using their more destructive attacks much easier.<p>"That was too easy," muttered Nabiki with a small frown. They<br/>hadn't had to deal with something so large, clumsy, and stupid in a<br/>long time. Most of their enemies as of late had been intelligent<br/>beings, much smaller and more agile. She had to admit, they hadn't<br/>fought anything with that much resistance to damage before.<p>Trunks floated down from above and clapped his hands as he watched<br/>them for a moment. "Excellent. Very well done. Your patrons are quite<br/>impressed."<p>The senshi looked uncomfortable at the mention of the patrons.<br/>Trunks had told them about the gods who gave them their powers, and<br/>the idea didn't sit well with some of them. Others didn't really care,<br/>but it seemed to bother Usagi the most. She believed that it was her<br/>own power and will that allowed her to succeed before.<p>Trunks confirmed that belief, stating that she wouldn't have been<br/>able to access as much power as she had unless that was true. Still,<br/>the power had to come from somewhere. Why not gods? He wasn't sure why<br/>it bothered some of them, but it did slightly. Only Ami and Minako<br/>seemed indifferent to it.<p>The girls hadn't met any of the gods since they arrived. The gods<br/>themselves were looking at it as some sort of vacation really. They<br/>spent most of their time in a self-contained 'heaven' that the boy had<br/>made for them shortly after their arrival. They lent their powers, and<br/>watched the show for the most part.<p>"That seemed too easy," said Nabiki as she glared at the boy.<p>"Oh? Well, I thought I'd take it easy on you today," replied the<br/>boy as he smirked at them all. "Thought keeping you busy would be the<br/>best way to keep your mind off waiting."<p>"Waiting for what?" said Usagi dumbly.<p>As if on cue, a door opened from thin air behind him and he<br/>smirked at them all. "That of course."<p>The girls simply stared at the opening in their reality for a long<br/>time. None of them were able to speak at all really.<p>Nabiki finally managed. "It's...it's been?"<p>"A whole year," said Trunks as he nodded at them cheerfully.<br/>"You've all done rather well actually." He paused at the dumb looks he<br/>was getting from them. "What? You mean you -all- lost track of the<br/>time?" he said as he stared at them for a moment in shock.<p>"Well, we have been busy," said Usagi nervously.<p>"Oh, well, we can go now," said Trunks with a small shrug.<p>The boy didn't react fast enough and quickly found himself<br/>trampled under a large group of teenage girls. "Of all the<br/>ungrateful..." he muttered painfully.<p>"Well, that was interesting," commented Hotaru as she walked up to<br/>him and helped him up. "Fun's over again?"<p>"Yeah, shame it is. We've got one more day in this room. Won't be<br/>the same though." He sighed and smirked at the girl. "Did you tell the<br/>gods?"<p>"Yeah, that's them," she jerked her thumb over her shoulder at the<br/>group of immortals who were walking up to them.<p>"It's been fun," said Venus cheerfully.<p>"Yeah, right," grumbled Urd lamely. "It's bad enough I've been<br/>here this long! Who knows what might have happened to Keiichi since<br/>I've been gone!"<p>"He might have found some peace and quiet?" offered Trunks as he<br/>twisted his pinky into his ear for a moment.<p>"Gah! That's horrible! Um...I mean I should find him before<br/>Belldandy gets worried!" She rushed out the door and the other gods<br/>followed after her.<p>Mars hung back and smirked at Trunks. "So, I finally get to meet<br/>the New Lord of All? Not as impressive as I imagined."<p>The boy peered at him for a moment and shrugged. "I'm a lot more<br/>impressive when I'm all there ya know?"<p>"Lord of All?" said Hotaru dumbly.<p>"It's a long story, and you don't need to hear it," said Trunks<br/>with a heavy sigh. "It's just this title thing I picked up on a really<br/>weird adventure. Doesn't mean anything really."<p>"Indeed," commented Mars with a slight chuckle. "Not to this<br/>version of you anyway. I'll be seeing you."<p>"You'd best remember who you're teasing, Mars," snorted Trunks<br/>calmly. "The real me isn't nearly as forgiving as I am."<p>"Well, that made absolutely no sense. I've decided that I really<br/>don't want to know," commented Hotaru as she walked out the door with<br/>him.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Finally! It's done! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!<p>Still a bit darker than I intended with this part. It got better<br/>though. Next time: Free at last!
