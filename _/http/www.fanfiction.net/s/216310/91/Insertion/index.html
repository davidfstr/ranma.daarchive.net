</div>Insertion<p>Part 91<p>The fall.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks sighed as he stared at the progress the girls were<br/>making with their training units. The wall was lined with several<br/>pod-like simulators. They didn't move, mostly because they didn't<br/>need too. Rather than create a training environment that<br/>encompassed the whole room, the pods created the field instead.<br/>It was a measure to conserve the amount of power they needed to<br/>use.<p>Washuu was sitting at a long table with him and George.<br/>Various papers were strewn across the wood surface along with a<br/>large number of binders and folders. "So, they are doing well?"<br/>asked Washuu.<p>"Not as well as I'd like," commented Trunks.<p>George nodded sleepily. "Ami is doing well in the repairs and<br/>maintenance. Usagi couldn't figure out which end of the<br/>blowtorch to use."<p>"That's not unexpected, she's doing well though," said Trunks<br/>as he smiled at the pair. "All around, she's probably the best of<br/>them. The others seem to excel more on individual things."<p>"Tsukino?" said Washuu as she stared at him dumbly.<p>"That's right," said Trunks as he tossed a folder at her.<br/>"Her scores are never above average. The others all have higher<br/>scores at one area or another, but their all around scores are<br/>actually lower than hers. Only by a point or two though. She's<br/>also the best shot."<p>"Hmmm. I hadn't noticed this before now," commented Washuu as<br/>she furrowed her brow slightly. "You're right though."<p>"Yeah, it gets old after a while," said the boy as he looked<br/>down at a few more papers. "So, what's the program for today?"<p>"Just a Star Destroyer, and a full compliment of Tie<br/>fighters," said George with a small shrug.<p>Trunks nodded. "Toss in an asteroid field."<p>The man blinked, but nodded his head.<p>"Okay, what's for lunch?" said the boy cheerfully.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>To say that Keiichi Morisato was in pain would be a bit of an<br/>understatement. He was lying on a bed covered in bandages.<p>"You were supposed to watch him!" snapped Akane as she belted<br/>Trunks across his head as she stood over him with Gohan and<br/>Cologne.<p>"Those involved have been punished. Extra guard duty for a<br/>month or so is the best I could get," said Cologne irritably.<br/>"They didn't know that you were to remain untouched. Word had<br/>spread of your arrival, but not of the immunity."<p>Gohan frowned and nodded. "He's not hurt too badly. He'll be<br/>bruised a bit, and probably have a hard time moving around for a<br/>few days."<p>"Damn you old woman. I told you we should have let him in,"<br/>growled Trunks as he glared at Cologne.<p>The old woman snorted at this. "Some of our rules may be<br/>bent, but not broken. I don't care how special you are."<p>"Oh? And what of Ranma Saotome's kiss?" said Gohan with a<br/>sort of cheerful grin forming on his face.<p>"That became optional when it was discovered that he was not<br/>human," replied Cologne calmly.<p>Keiichi muttered painfully in his sleep.<p>"What's he doing?" said Trunks as he frowned at the boy.<p>"Bell..." whispered the boy.<p>"Oh shit," said Gohan as he quickly grabbed the boy by his<br/>shoulders and shook him.<p>"What's going on?" cried Akane.<p>"This isn't good," muttered Gohan as he realized what Trunks<br/>was doing.<p>"What do you mean?" snapped Cologne.<p>"This boy, he's staying with three goddesses right now,"<br/>growled Trunks as Keiichi opened his eyes slowly.<p>"He was trying to call to them in his sleep," commented<br/>Gohan.<p>"So?" muttered Akane.<p>"He probably didn't even know he was doing it," grumbled<br/>Trunks. "If he succeeded, we're about to have visitors."<p>"What do you mean?" Cologne did not look happy with this.<p>"We're about to have three pissed off goddesses land on our<br/>heads," said Gohan as he turned towards the door.<p>"What?" gasped Akane.<p>"What have you brought down on us now?" Cologne's mood<br/>wasn't getting any better.<p>"Relax, we're gonna take Keiichi outside of the village.<br/>Maybe if we give them what they want, and explain things, they'll<br/>help us," replied Trunks as he followed.<p>"You should have done that sooner then!" snapped Akane<br/>angrily as she followed after the pair.<p>"We didn't have time," replied Gohan calmly. "If Ranma<br/>figured out where we were, we wouldn't have stood much of a<br/>chance. He's a lot stronger than we are."<p>"What?" said Cologne as she froze in place. "If what you say<br/>is true..."<p>"Relax old lady, we've got help on the way," said Trunks<br/>calmly. "There is another one like us, he'll be the strongest of<br/>us all."<p>Cologne narrowed her eyes at the pair. "If you survive those<br/>Goddesses at all..."<p>"Heh. Let us worry about that," said Gohan with a smirk on<br/>his face.<p>Cologne was almost knocked off her feet by the sudden surge<br/>of power that blasted off the pair. The ground shook violently<br/>under the village, spilling amazons and their possessions to the<br/>ground all across the village. Her eyes went wide as she<br/>staggered back. "This is..."<p>"Heh. We're just getting started," said Gohan with a<br/>confident smirk on his face. His hair looked like it was threads<br/>of pure gold. Trunks looked much the same, both of them had grown<br/>larger and their hair was longer and had a more edged appearance<br/>to it.<p>"This is just our first transformation," agreed Trunks<br/>calmly.<p>"Showoffs," muttered Akane as she snorted. It was obvious she<br/>wasn't impressed.<p>Trunks blushed a bit at this.<p>"Don't be that way, the old bat is just jealous," said Gohan<br/>cheerfully as he pat his companion on his back.<p>Keiichi was lying on the ground looking confused. "Oh man.<br/>Now what?"<p>Trunks lifted him up and hefted him over his shoulder. "Come<br/>on."<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome stared off in the distance. He had a frown on<br/>his face as he floated over the forest and simply watched the sky<br/>in the distance.<p>"What was that?" growled Chibi Usa as she stopped directly by<br/>his side. Neither of them was transformed at the moment. Chibi<br/>Usa was in her 'Dark Lady' form again.<p>"A power, weak compared to us, but still unusually strong,"<br/>said the pigtailed boy as he narrowed his eyes in the distance.<br/>"Unfamiliar to me."<p>"So?" growled Chibi Usa.<p>"It could be dangerous, perhaps..." Ranma frowned.<p>"We have a mission," said the girl hatefully.<p>"I know, but this shouldn't be ignored," said her father as<br/>he glared at her. "There is something out there, too strong to be<br/>ignored."<p>"So what do you want to do? We need to complete this<br/>mission," said the woman irritably.<p>"I'll take care of the mission, you go and see what that<br/>was," said the boy calmly.<p>"What?" growled the girl irritably.<p>"Find that power, destroy it, I think I might know what it<br/>is," commented the pigtailed boy as he turned to look at her<br/>again. "I think whoever pulled Keiichi out of our grip is there.<br/>That power I felt could be those goddesses. Go, if I'm right kill<br/>Keiichi, take down whoever stole him from out grip. Do not fight<br/>the goddesses. The whole point of killing him is to get them out<br/>of our way. Don't give the other two a reason to hang around when<br/>we've finished."<p>Chibi Usa growled.<p>"Go!" snapped Ranma angrily.<p>The girl gave him a final glance and flew off in the<br/>direction he had pointed out.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Usagi Tsukino grit her teeth as she pitched back and rolled<br/>in her X-wing. Two of the Ties following her managed to duplicate<br/>the maneuver and shot after her at high speed. She blasted<br/>through the remains of Minako's starship with an angry looking<br/>frown on her face. "I can't shake them!"<p>"Hold on Tsukino," said a deadly calm voice from her com.<br/>"I'm coming towards you from the left."<p>Laser blast exploded all around her as she struggled and<br/>weaved through the void. Her entire left side was nothing more<br/>than the dull gray metal of the Star Destroyer's hull. "No! I<br/>don't wanna die!" cried the girl as she jerked back again. This<br/>time she flipped over in mid flight, finding herself pointing<br/>directly at the two fighters that had been chasing her. "Get out<br/>of my way!" She fired her lasers almost reflexively. The next<br/>thing she knew there was nothing but the bright orange of the<br/>explosion surrounding her cockpit, then the sea of stars on the<br/>other side once again. "I made it!" she cried in triumph.<p>"Tsukino," said Ami's monotone voice. "One has survived."<p>The blonde screeched in surprise as another starship screamed<br/>over the top of her own, no more than a foot of distance between<br/>them. Ami destroyed the stray fighter in a hail of laser fire and<br/>the pair was clear for a few seconds.<p>"Thanks Mizuno," muttered Usagi as she tried to catch her<br/>breath from the surprise.<p>"Pay attention. Another wave is approaching," was the only<br/>reply.<p>"Kino, why is that deflector shield still up?" said Nabiki's<br/>voice from the com.<p>"They are taking too long," said Ami.<p>"You worry about those fighters, I'll worry about the<br/>shields!" was Makoto's irritated reply. "There's a lot of guns on<br/>the surface, I can't get a clean run. We're handling it."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>One of the X-wing fighters went barreling through the hail of<br/>lasers as it charged forward. Rei screamed as she fired<br/>repeatedly at the gun emplacements. Occasionally, a small<br/>explosion could be seen in her wake, and the fire died down just<br/>a little. "Kino! I don't know how much longer I can do this!" she<br/>screamed as she evaded more fire skillfully.<p>"I'm on it!" cried the girl as her fighter blasted by Rei on<br/>her left side. "I'm making my run. Cover me!"<p>Rei nodded slowly and pulled up behind her. The pair shot<br/>directly towards the large dome deflectors on the top of the<br/>battleship. Fire surrounded them, but the emplacements that were<br/>left were not designed to cover that area of the battle cruiser.<br/>The dome exploded in a spectacular ball of flames.<p>"Got it!" cried Makoto triumphantly. One of the lasers tore<br/>through her ship and she was gone in another smaller explosion.<p>"No! Makoto!" cried Rei. "Damn it!" She steeled herself and<br/>frowned. "There's one more left, I'm going for it."<p>"You won't last without cover!" snapped Nabiki angrily. "Fall<br/>back! I'm sending Ami to support you!"<p>"Too late!" cried the girl as she shot across the surface of<br/>the Star Destroyer. No more than five feet above the surface she<br/>blasted ahead at full throttle. The ship rocked as the tail came<br/>into contact with the surface as she pulled up hard.<br/>"YAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!"<p>"What the hell are you doing?" cried Nabiki angrily as her<br/>ship passed over Hino's ship.<p>"I won't fail!" Her lasers came to life; the second dome of<br/>the ship blew into thousands of pieces as the girl blasted<br/>through it. Unfortunately, Rei's ship did not survive the<br/>explosion.<p>"Damn!" growled Nabiki angrily. "Tsukino, Mizuno, regroup and<br/>prepare for final attack run. Their shields are down."<p>The three ships pulled away from their positions, dodging<br/>dozens of Tie fighters as they moved a short distance away from<br/>the starship and formed up.<p>"Tsukino, you have the lead. Mizuno and I will cover you,"<br/>said Nabiki.<p>"Right," said the girl. Her voice wavered slightly and she<br/>swallowed. "Okay Usagi. You can do this!" Her gaze became hard<br/>and she stared forward.<p>The trio shot forward towards the front of the Star Destroyer<br/>and into the swarm of Ties once again.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>The doors to the pods opened and six girls stepped out. A few<br/>of them where a little more pale than the others. Only Ami and<br/>Usagi were steady as they moved away from the training modules.<p>"You are becoming more useful," commented Ami as she moved up<br/>beside Usagi.<p>The girl blinked and looked at her for a moment. "What?"<p>"Keep it up," said Ami as she continued to walk ahead of<br/>them.<p>Nabiki watched the exchange from the rear of the group. She<br/>had a tired looking frown on her face, but it broke slightly at<br/>the sight of the scene. "So, you're gaining respect from them<br/>again."<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Well, they're taking this rather well," commented Carrot as<br/>he watched the girls relax after training. The bunks they stayed<br/>in now were identical to the ones they had used in their previous<br/>training. He was watching them from a closed circuit television<br/>monitor.<p>"It's not near as bad as it was the first time." Dan actually<br/>sounded a little disappointed as he said this.<p>"Well, they are well trained now," said Ranma.<p>Pissant merely grumbled uncomfortably. "Why do we still send<br/>them to hell though?"<p>"Because I don't want them getting used to dying in those<br/>starships any more than I want them to get used to dying without<br/>them," was Carrot's reply.<p>"Yeah, quit complaining," agreed Dan.<p>Ranma sighed. "I think they're gonna take a shower again."<p>"Good. More fun for us then!" said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"This time, don't use that scented lotion damn it," grumbled<br/>Dan. "I hate it when we smell like apples."<p>"Wonder if Kino and Mizuno will wash each other's back<br/>again?" said Carrot cheerfully as he switched the camera to the<br/>shower room.<p>"Man, being ten sucks," commented Ranma as he put a large<br/>bottle of lotion on the table.<p>"None of that 'amaguriken' shit this time damn it. I wanna<br/>enjoy ourselves," said Carrot angrily.<p>"This is wrong on so many levels," whimpered Pissant.<p>"Well, we could hit up Washuu, but she'd have to be a little<br/>girl. It'd just be weird otherwise," said Carrot.<p>The group thought about it for a moment.<p>"Naaah."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma stared at the mountain before him with a grin on his<br/>face. "Wonder who I'll meet with first?" He chuckled as he landed<br/>in front of the mountain and glanced around. The entrance was in<br/>front of him, unguarded. "Mount Phoenix? How quaint, I was<br/>expecting something a bit bigger."<p>With an evil smirk on his face, he strolled inside.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks frowned as he waited patiently outside Joketzuko.<br/>Gohan's face was actually somewhat serious as they stood there in<br/>their super forms and watched the sky.<p>"Here it comes," said Trunks calmly.<p>The sky overhead began to grow dark, thunder rumbled in the<br/>distance.<p>"Sounds like they're pissed," commented Gohan without much<br/>humor in his tone.<p>The trio appeared above them just below the clouds. The two<br/>saiyans simply waited calmly as they descended.<p>"It's not going to help our case that he's all beat up,"<br/>pointed out Gohan.<p>"I know, just shut up will ya? I'm thinking," grumbled<br/>Trunks.<p>Belldandy was the first to land. "Keiichi!" she called as she<br/>glanced around.<p>Urd was the next to touch down. She looked around and frowned<br/>calmly. "I can sense him. He's nearby."<p>Skuld landed on her face almost. "Ouch." She quickly managed<br/>to stand and frowned at her sisters. "Are you sure he's here?"<p>"Yes. Once he called to us, I was able to break through<br/>whatever was hiding him from us," said Urd as she glanced down at<br/>the younger Goddess.<p>"Um. Hi," said Gohan as he stepped towards the trio.<p>The Goddesses noticed them all at once.<p>"Who are you? Why did you take Keiichi away?" snapped<br/>Belldandy angrily.<p>"You're gonna let us explain first? Great!" said Gohan<br/>cheerfully.<p>Trunks put his head into his hand. "Idiot."<p>This caught all the goddesses off guard. They simply stared<br/>at them for a moment. That was when Belldandy noticed Keiichi<br/>sitting behind the pair. "Keiichi!" She rushed forward and shoved<br/>them aside as she put her arms around his neck. "Are you hurt?"<p>"Um, kinda," said Gohan nervously. "That wasn't really our<br/>fault though..."<p>The goddess simply looked up at him. Keiichi was crying tears<br/>of joy, surely he was free of his torment now. "I was so scared!"<p>"What do you mean 'it wasn't our fault'?" growled Urd as an<br/>aura of power formed in her hands.<p>"Wait! We had to take him! He would have died if we didn't!"<br/>cried Gohan as he put his hands up.<p>"Explain," said Urd as she narrowed her eyes at the pair.<br/>Neither of them looked like they wanted to put up any resistance.<br/>It was kind of disappointing.<p>"Um, we're from the future. We were kinda sent back in time<br/>to make sure some bad stuff doesn't happen. Keeping him alive was<br/>part of that," said Trunks.<p>"Bull! I would have felt a temporal disturbance if..." Urd<br/>paused. "Wait a minute! There is a temporal disturbance!" She<br/>glared at the pair. "Well, back you go then!" She raised her<br/>hands into the air.<p>The pair quickly moved into a defensive stance. "You'll<br/>regret it if you do it!" cried Trunks.<p>"Can't have you here messing with time," reasoned Urd calmly<br/>as she continued to power up her spell. "This won't hurt a bit!"<p>"If you get rid of us now, Keiichi will die! The whole planet<br/>will suffer!" growled Trunks.<p>"Time travel? Must be a bug in the system," grumbled Skuld as<br/>she pulled out her debugger.<p>Belldandy moved between the two pairs and frowned. She had<br/>her arms spread out wide and faced the two saiyans. "What do you<br/>mean Keiichi will die?"<p>Both boys relaxed a bit and stared at her.<p>"Should I?" asked Gohan.<p>"No. I'll do it," replied Trunks. "In about a month, a large<br/>fleet of starships will come to Earth and wipe out most of the<br/>human population. If Keiichi dies, then you'll be gone too. That<br/>means you can't help us."<p>"We can't help you anyway. We can't become involved with this<br/>sort of thing. There are rules against that."<p>"You're right. You can't fight them, but you can protect,"<br/>said Trunks as he smiled at her. "Fighting is someone else's job.<br/>We were just sent back to make sure things go right in order to<br/>prevent the disaster. The one who will fight, is still on Jurai."<p>"You mean him?" muttered Urd as she stared at the boys. "I<br/>get it now. That's what he's training the senshi for."<p>"You didn't know?" muttered Gohan in surprise.<p>"I knew, but things are starting to fall into place a little<br/>more now. I'll bet this is Pluto's doing."<p>The saiyans blushed a little as they looked away.<p>"Why is Keiichi so important?" muttered Belldandy as she<br/>looked at the boy. "And why is he all beat up?"<p>It was Keiichi's turn to blush.<p>"If Keiichi dies, you have to go back to heaven with him. His<br/>wish was for you to be with him always. That means even in death,<br/>you'll be with him."<p>Belldandy gasped and her eyes went wide. "Oh!"<p>"This whole mess is starting to make sense," muttered Urd as<br/>she looked thoughtful for a moment.<p>"Maybe it is," said a new voice from above them.<p>Gohan and Trunks immediately jumped back in surprise.<p>Dark Lady floated overhead, a vicious smirk on her face as<br/>she glared down at the scene. "Well, look what I've found. A lost<br/>little boy, three goddesses, and two fighters who can't match my<br/>power even if they combined their strength."<p>"I wouldn't bet on that," growled Trunks angrily.<p>The woman floated down to the ground and smirked at them.<br/>"I've got to wonder, where two more Saiyans came from though. I<br/>thought there were only four of us left."<p>The duo tightened up their stances and growled.<p>"You weren't expecting me here, were you?" said the pink<br/>haired woman as she eyed them for a moment. "Thought you were<br/>safe in China?"<p>"What's going on?" asked Belldandy as she watched the<br/>standoff.<p>"Well, father will be very pleased to hear this, after he's<br/>finished with the Phoenix King."<p>"Damn," growled Gohan. "They know where we are."<p>"This isn't good," agreed Trunks.<p>"Ha! How long did you expect to hide from us here? We should<br/>have realized where you had gone right away."<p>"That won't do you any good," said Gohan as he steadied<br/>himself a little more. "We might not be able to beat you, but<br/>we're strong enough to escape. Even you can't fight three<br/>goddesses to get to Keiichi now."<p>"Maybe not," agreed Chibi Usa as she watched the three women<br/>stand protectively around Keiichi. "He'll get what's coming to<br/>him soon enough." She frowned as she glared at him. "Father would<br/>be so irritated with me if I killed three goddesses anyway." She<br/>snorted and turned her back on them. "We'll meet again soon<br/>enough. You can have him until then."<p>The two boys growled as she floated away lazily.<p>"This could be a problem," grumbled Urd.<p>"You have no idea," snorted Trunks as he turned to look at<br/>her.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma smiled at the group of armed guards that stood around<br/>him. He was calm and collected while the birdmen stood around him<br/>with spears and pikes held at the ready.<p>"You should not have come here," growled one of the guards<br/>coldly.<p>"Please, I don't have time to play with such weak beings.<br/>Tell me, where is the Emperor Saffron? I need to speak with him."<p>"What would you know about Saffron?" growled one of the<br/>winged guards irritably.<p>"I know where Jusendo is, and how to get inside," replied<br/>Ranma simply. "Now, move out of my way."<p>The guards did not budge, confusion was clear on their<br/>features.<p>"Do you want me to spell it out for you?" snorted Ranma as<br/>his patience grew thin.<p>"Go speak with the chancellor," said the head guard to one of<br/>his soldiers. "Tell him what you have heard and return quickly."<p>Ranma watched the man go and crossed his arms over his chest<br/>lazily. "I hate waiting."<p>"What do you want here?" growled the lead guard angrily.<p>"I want to revive Saffron," replied the boy as calmly as<br/>ever.<p>"Why? Do you know what that means for your kind landling?"<br/>snorted the man in reply.<p>"Yes. I know exactly what he means to my kind," replied Ranma<br/>darkly. "My reasons are my own. You shouldn't look a gift horse<br/>in the mouth."<p>The guard snorted and sat back to await the arrival of his<br/>subordinate. "Watch him closely."<p>There was a sound down the hallway. Ranma arched his eyebrow<br/>and frowned at the noise. "What?"<p>"We're under attack!" cried a desperate looking guard who<br/>rushed down the hallway.<p>Ranma snorted irritably. "Chibi-Usa."<p>The guards that surrounded him moved closer and pointed their<br/>weapons at him once again. "You know who's doing this?"<p>"Yes, she's my daughter, and a complete moron. We're supposed<br/>to get you as allies. What's she thinking?" He growled under his<br/>breath as he shoved the pair in front of him aside easily and<br/>strolled back into the mountain.<p>About a minute later he came upon and odd scene. His daughter<br/>was standing over a pile of broken birdmen with a scowl on her<br/>face. "Lowborn pigs. Get out of my way." She dusted off her hands<br/>and turned around. The angry boy standing in front of her with a<br/>scowl on his face gave her pause and she froze.<p>"We weren't supposed to attack them," said the boy coldly.<br/>"We need them, as allies for now."<p>The woman bowed her head and growled as she was admonished.<br/>"But..."<p>"If you've screwed this up, I'll take it out of your hide,"<br/>said the boy coldly. "Report."<p>The woman glared at him as she spoke, her fingers flexed as<br/>she struggled to hold her temper. "I couldn't get to Morisato. He<br/>was with two more of our kind that I don't recognize. They<br/>weren't strong enough to beat me, but the three goddesses were<br/>there as well. I could not destroy him."<p>The pigtailed boy nodded and frowned. "The goddesses have<br/>found him, that is not good. He will not be alone for some time<br/>then. A small crimp in our plans if nothing else. The goddesses<br/>cannot oppose us directly though, so it is not too much of a<br/>problem."<p>Chibi-Usa nodded slowly and her frown deepened. "What of the<br/>other two?"<p>Ranma smiled at her. "They'll have to be dealt with, but not<br/>before we find out who they are, and how they ended up here. We<br/>should be the last of our kind. What were their names? What did<br/>they look like?"<p>Chibi Usa frowned at her father and snorted. "They were<br/>pathetically weak, I think they have only achieved their first<br/>transformation. One had short black hair and the other had brown<br/>shoulder length hair. They had the same build as you...well,<br/>perhaps larger. They seemed older than you as well."<p>Ranma merely nodded. "This could be a problem."<p>"Where did they come from? Do you know? Where there other<br/>survivors?" asked the woman as she noticed the guards standing<br/>behind her father. She smirked at them for a moment and looked<br/>back at him.<p>"Probably the same place you came from, if only a little<br/>farther ahead. They need to be dealt with quickly. They will grow<br/>in power quickly if they are not destroyed. In a year or two,<br/>they will be quite a threat."<p>Chibi-Usa growled a response out to that. It wasn't a very<br/>nice one, but Ranma ignored her and turned towards the guards.<br/>"Where is this chancellor?"<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Trunks and Gohan found themselves standing in the middle of<br/>the village again with two more guests.<p>Cologne stared at the two women who had come back with the<br/>group so hard that the two saiyans were beginning to think that<br/>her eyes might fall out of her head.<p>"Goddesses you say?"<p>"That's right," said Trunks calmly.<p>"Are you certain?" muttered the old woman as she peered at<br/>them.<p>"Pretty sure," replied Gohan with a shrug.<p>"Um..." muttered Belldandy. "We aren't supposed to tell<br/>people about..."<p>"It would have been hard to hide anyway," said Gohan as he<br/>glanced at her. "Some of these people can sense stuff like that."<p>"Oh," mumbled Urd as she watched the women around her. They<br/>had a rather large crowd gathered around them by this point.<p>"Well, I guess you three can stay at the temple with Keiichi.<br/>He has to be guarded at all times. They won't attack him if<br/>you're around," said Gohan as he glanced over to them. "They'll<br/>be watching for the opportunity though. Don't let your guard<br/>down."<p>"Why not?" muttered Urd as she frowned at him.<p>"Getting the gods pissed at you is one thing, giving them a<br/>reason to come after you is something else entirely," replied<br/>Trunks as he leveled his gaze on Belldandy.<p>"I see," muttered the gentle goddess nervously.<p>Trunks noticed that there were only two goddesses standing<br/>there at this point and blinked. "Um...where's Skuld?"<p>There was a loud cracking sound from a fair distance behind<br/>them. Everyone turned to look in the direction it had come from.<p>"Shit," muttered Trunks.<p>"There goes the rest of our day," agreed Gohan with a heavy<br/>sigh.<p>Skuld was standing over the prone form of one of the village<br/>girls. She looked to be about the same age as Skuld physically.<br/>The goddess was holding her debugger over her shoulder and had a<br/>rather satisfied looking smirk on her face. "Take that you<br/>bully!"<p>Trunks covered his eyes with his hand.<p>Gohan smiled at him cheerfully. "Should you say something, or<br/>should I?"<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma smiled at the old birdman that appeared before him. He<br/>was escorted by a large squad of guards and had a scowl on his<br/>face as he glared at them.<p>"Hello, you must be the chancellor," said the boy as he<br/>nodded his head towards him.<p>"What do you want?"<p>"Saffron to return to full power, and an alliance," replied<br/>the boy calmly.<p>The old man snorted at this. "Why?"<p>"Because I will rule this planet," replied Ranma coldly. "Or<br/>I will destroy it."<p>The old man narrowed his eyes at the pair in front of him.<br/>The woman had been silent so far and merely glared at him. "Kill<br/>them."<p>Ranma just smiled. "Well, I suppose we'll just have to take<br/>Saffron by force then." The birdmen around him jumped back as the<br/>auras came to life around the pair.<p>"Kill as few as possible, we need their numbers," instructed<br/>Ranma.<p>Chibi-Usa just smiled.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Well, now what?"<p>Washuu looked slightly annoyed at Trunks as he sat up from<br/>lying on the floor. He looked quite bored really.<p>"Huh? What ya mean?" muttered the boy as he frowned at her.<p>"We've run out of training programs for the girls," replied<br/>the woman with a shrug.<p>Trunks stared at her, he didn't look like he was very sure<br/>what to do. "What do you mean we've run out?"<p>"The Senshi have completed their training," replied the woman<br/>calmly. "There's nothing left for them to do."<p>"Um, Star Wars?"<p>"All one hundred and thirty seven campaigns completed."<p>"Wing Commander?"<p>"Done."<p>"Um...Colony Wars?"<p>"Last week," replied Washuu.<p>"Decent?"<p>"Finished in about three days," replied the woman as she<br/>looked at the chart in her hand.<p>"Really?" said the boy dumbly.<p>"Every program you've supplied has been completed," replied<br/>the woman as she shrugged again.<p>Trunks scratched his head. "Um, how long will it take to<br/>create more?"<p>"I can do a few more for them within a few days," replied the<br/>woman as she shrugged. "Using the parameters from the other<br/>programs, we should be able to work something out."<p>Trunks nodded. "Load the program for the ships they'll be<br/>using once we leave and mix up the current training programs a<br/>bit."<p>Washuu glanced at him. "What?"<p>"The ships they'll be using when we go to war, the one's<br/>you've spent the last four years building," replied Trunks as he<br/>frowned at her. "They've had enough experience with the default<br/>ships. Just do some review stuff with the new system in place.<br/>That way they can get used to the control setup and abilities of<br/>their fighters."<p>"I see, I was wondering why we hadn't been training them in<br/>those ships," responded the woman as she glanced down at the<br/>chart in her hands.<p>Trunks shrugged. "Huh? That wouldn't have been much fun. This<br/>way they get experience with all sorts of styles and makes of<br/>starships. Never know when that might come in handy. Besides, I<br/>wanted them to get the basics down. Doing that sort of thing in<br/>the ships you built would be a little to easy for them."<p>Washuu stared at him for a moment. "Ah. I see." She turned<br/>away. "It shouldn't be too hard to throw these ships into the<br/>training system. I suppose we could increase the difficulty as<br/>well."<p>"Yeah, go ahead," replied the boy as he lay on his back<br/>again. "Wish I'd thought to bring Hotaru along. I wasn't<br/>expecting to have this much free time." With a heavy sigh he<br/>jumped to his feet and looked around. "Guess I should train some<br/>more." He walked over to a small console on the wall and began to<br/>tap a few of the buttons. Several moments later, large training<br/>weights appeared on his arms and legs. They were several thousand<br/>times heavier than they looked and he smiled as he felt his<br/>muscles strain under the weight. "This should work."<p>"These are heavy," muttered Pissant.<p>"So? That's the point, what are you complaining for?" snorted<br/>Ranma as he started to punch at the air.<p>"I'm not, it's just that..." Pissant was somewhat uncertain<br/>for a moment.<p>"Just spit it out!" snapped Dan as they felt their body rise<br/>into the air.<p>"What if we become too strong, and our muscles get really<br/>big?" said the whiny voice pathetically.<p>"What?" said Carrot as they paused their exercise.<p>"We could really hurt ourselves!" cried Pissant.<p>"I'm going to kill him!" said Dan as he started to charge up<br/>a ki ball in his hand and pointed it at his head.<p>"We'll die too," pointed out Ranma.<p>"Pissant, let me ask you something. Why did you think we were<br/>doing this in the first place!" snapped Carrot.<p>"That's not what I meant! What if we're watching the senshi<br/>shower again, and we grab it too hard or pull something?"<p>"..."<p>"Please let me kill him!" cried Dan.<p>"Focus on the training idiots!" snapped Ranma as he began to<br/>push their body harder.<p>"Ya know, as much as I hate to admit it, he's got a point.<br/>We're gonna have to be careful about stuff like that," said<br/>Carrot.<p>Dan screamed in rage as the blasted them in the head. "Just<br/>die!"<p>They fell to the ground and fell in a heap. The little boy's<br/>arms and legs moved at impossible speeds as he beat himself<br/>senseless.<p>They paused and looked up as a shadow fell over them. Trunks<br/>looked up and saw Ami Mizuno staring at them with a blank<br/>expression on her face.<p>"Um...Hi."<p>Ami didn't react much at all. "I was going to ask you for<br/>instructions on today's activities. Washuu says that we will not<br/>be using the training module for the day."<p>"Um, take today off?" said the embarrassed looking boy. He<br/>had a large black eye forming on his face and several bruises<br/>were becoming apparent.<p>"Very well," replied the girl.<p>"Where's Nabiki at?" asked Trunks as he sat up.<p>"She is still speaking with Washuu about the future training<br/>schedule. I was sent in her stead to ask for further<br/>instruction."<p>"Um, right." The boy nodded and stood up while dusting<br/>himself off. "Anything else you were wondering about?"<p>"Yes. What smells like apples?" Ami glanced around in<br/>confusion.<p>"It's nothing," replied the boy as he turned away from her.<p>"Very well. I shall return and tell the others that we are<br/>released from duty until tomorrow."<p>"You do that," said Trunks without looking at her.<p>Ami turned away and started walking. She paused when she<br/>heard the boy muttering to himself for a moment.<p>"I told you! Next time make sure it's unscented!"<p>She decided that it was best that she did not know. She<br/>continued back to the group to deliver the instructions she'd<br/>been given.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma smiled darkly as he stood over the cowering boy. "Well,<br/>what have we here? A little boy, with no power to speak of."<p>"Who are you? What do you want?" cried the boy fearfully as<br/>he backed against the wall. There was nothing he could do, his<br/>guards were defeated, and Kiima was lying on the ground out cold.<br/>Only the scary looking figure and the pink haired woman with a<br/>cruel looking grin on her face remained.<p>"I am Ranma Saotome, and I have come to make you an offer<br/>that you cannot refuse," replied the boy with his grin growing<br/>harder somehow. "I will make you a man, and give you more power<br/>than even you can imagine."<p>The boy stared at him with his jaw hanging down. "What?"<p>"There is a price for my kindness boy. In return, you and<br/>your people will become my servants. Together, we can rule this<br/>planet, conquer the galaxy itself. Will you join me?"<p>The pink haired woman growled angrily behind him, but didn't<br/>make a move to stop him.<p>"You'll make me into a man?" he muttered dumbly.<p>"That's just an expression. We're going to Jusendo, to awaken<br/>your real power. I know you begin to feel the desire even now,<br/>your body is already preparing for the transformation."<p>The boy shied away from his hand and frowned. "What?"<p>"You are beaten, it is useless to resist," said Ranma coldly.<p>Saffron slid along the wall away from the pair as best he<br/>could. There was nowhere for him to go. "There is no escape.<br/>Don't make me destroy you. Saffron, you do not yet realize your<br/>importance. You have only begun to discover your power! Join me<br/>and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we<br/>can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy!"<p>"I'll never join you!" cried the boy fearfully. His voice<br/>wavered as he shook with terror.<p>"If you only knew the power of the dark side!"<p>Chibi Usa smirked. She knew that her father had to omit a bit<br/>about this speech. It wasn't the first time she'd heard it from<br/>him.<p>"Dark side?" said the boy in confusion. "When I'm grown up,<br/>I'll have all the power I need!"<p>Ranma raised his palm and a ball of light formed between his<br/>fingers. He released the energy and Saffron cringed in terror.<br/>Slowly, the boy raised his head and looked up. In the wall of the<br/>mountain was a huge hole. The room he had been moved too when the<br/>attack started was in the center of the mountain. Saffron's eyes<br/>went wide as he realized he could see the sky outside at the end<br/>of the new tunnel.<p>"Come with me. It is the only way," said Ranma as he offered<br/>his hand once again.<p>Saffron looked down at his hands and turned towards the older<br/>boy. He growled to himself for a moment and reached out.<p>"Take me to Jusendo."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Kuroi, I don't like this," said Tochi as she frowned at the<br/>boy sitting behind a large desk. They were in what appeared to be<br/>a darkened office.<p>"Really?" asked the boy as he turned away from what he was<br/>doing to look at her.<p>"These Phoenix people bother me," growled the woman.<p>"I thought it was rather clever. Enslave an obscure race, and<br/>save us the trouble of gathering a large force of Youma for what<br/>we need."<p>"They could turn on us," said Tochi as she frowned at him.<p>"I doubt it. Ranma isn't stupid, he has plans to keep them in<br/>line," said the boy calmly. Transporting them will pose a bit of<br/>a problem, but it's not too bad. We've collected enough spare<br/>energy to manage."<p>Tochi nodded. "Still, I'd feel more comfortable using our own<br/>forces."<p>"I agree, but we do not have the time, nor the resources to<br/>deal with it at this point. Creating a force that large is bound<br/>to garner us unwanted attention as well."<p>"Beryl?" asked the female Youma.<p>"Metallia concerns me more," said the boy calmly. "Beryl is<br/>just an indirect way of telling her."<p>"We can't reveal our plans too soon?" asked the woman as she<br/>nodded.<p>"Yes, and this course of action is the safest way to<br/>accomplish that," said the boy as he turned back to the papers<br/>he'd been looking over.<p>"I see. Very well then." She nodded and turned towards the<br/>doors.<p>"Going somewhere?" asked Kuroi as he smirked at her.<p>"I'm going to make sure things are going our way," she<br/>responded calmly.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma frowned as he flew with Saffron under his arm. He<br/>paused and floated in mid air for a moment. "Something..."<p>"What is it?" snapped Chibi Usa impatiently.<p>"Mother." Ranma frowned and narrowed his eyes as a dark cloud<br/>formed in front of him.<p>Beryl floated with an angry looking frown on her face in<br/>front of the pair. She had just become visible to them and waited<br/>for them to approach.<p>"Hold him," said Ranma as he handed Saffron to his daughter.<p>The boy looked up at her nervously as she cradled him in her<br/>arms.<p>"What are you going to do?" said Chibi Usa as she glared at<br/>him.<p>"I'm going to go see what she wants," replied the boy calmly.<br/>He shot forward across the sky towards the dark woman.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>"There you are," said Beryl as she noticed her son appear in<br/>front of her.<p>"What do you want?" he asked calmly.<p>"You dare treat me with such disrespect?" she snarled<br/>hatefully.<p>"If you don't have anything useful to say..." started her<br/>son.<p>"Insolent boy! I created you so that you'd help me! You've<br/>been playing around long enough! Come with me, we have a world<br/>to..."<p>"Destroy? Conquer maybe? Please mother, I can handle that<br/>without your help."<p>Beryl's jaw dropped. "What?"<p>"I've been taking over the planet for months now, and getting<br/>ready for the battles to come for some time. You've been cooling<br/>your heels, gathering energy for whatever that thing is that you<br/>seem to like so much. All the while, I've been ignoring your<br/>foolish plots and concentrating on the big prize. Don't you feel<br/>foolish?"<p>The woman growled angrily as dark power began to form around<br/>her. "What?"<p>"Swearing your loyalty to something like that is foolish.<br/>She'll destroy you once your usefulness is over. I'm surprised<br/>she's put up with you as long as she has. From what I understand,<br/>the humans foiled your most recent plot. The police no less.<br/>Really mother, it shames me so to hear about things like that."<p>"So. You will not help me?" growled Beryl angrily.<p>"I'm doing what you've failed in," he replied simply. "To<br/>accept your help would be stupid. You've bungled your way through<br/>four generals, and your Youma Lords have stabbed you in the back.<br/>They're working with me, and we have no intention of conquering<br/>the planet, just to give it away to Metallia. She'll be dealt<br/>with soon enough."<p>"Betrayer!" snarled Beryl hatefully.<p>"Really mother! Who are you to talk?" said Ranma as his dark<br/>smile widened. "In any case, I may have found a use for you after<br/>all."<p>"What?" snapped the woman as she stared at him.<p>Ranma vanished from in front of her. "After all, we can't<br/>have you going back and telling Metallia about all this can we?"<p>Her head snapped around just in time to see a fist close in<br/>on her face. "No!"<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Saffron stood in the steaming pool and frowned at Ranma as he<br/>stood overhead. Beryl struggled in his grip, tightly bound and<br/>gagged. She growled angrily as he held her above the ground.<p>"What's she for?" snorted Chibi Usa irritably. "You should<br/>have killed her by now!"<p>"Saffron needs food to complete his transformation properly,"<br/>responded her father calmly. He looked down and noticed the<br/>threads beginning to form around the young boy in the pool. "Ah,<br/>here we go." With a casual toss the bound and gagged girl was<br/>thrown into the threads. The demigod quickly consumed her as he<br/>became encased in his egg. "Now, we need only wait."<p>The pink haired woman nodded once and frowned. Beryl's<br/>muffled screams only lasted a few minutes, and her gag kept the<br/>noise down considerably. "You should have taken off the gag."<p>Ranma nodded. "I know. I didn't think about it. Oh well, at<br/>least we got to watch."<p>The pair sat back and waited quietly. Saffron would not<br/>emerge for several hours and they had a bit of time. After about<br/>ten minutes Ranma stood up.<p>"Huh?" muttered his daughter.<p>"Come on, we might as well get some training in while we're<br/>here."<p>The girl nodded and followed him as he rose into the air. The<br/>mountain wall was easily blasted aside as the pair flew off into<br/>the air.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Setsuna frowned as she stood on top of a smaller mountain<br/>near to where Saffron was being reborn. "It's almost time."<p>Her daughter appeared at her side and nodded silently. "So<br/>now what?"<p>"There is much to do. I fear I don't have much time left."<p>Tsuki blinked at this. "Huh? What do you mean?"<p>Setsuna smiled at her daughter. "You'll understand soon<br/>enough. No matter how long you live, there will always be things<br/>left unfinished, and regrets that you will not have time to<br/>correct." She placed her hand on the girl's head as she said<br/>this.<p>"Mom, you're talkin funny."<p>"Come, we must act. There is little we can do here, but there<br/>are allies we have not awakened yet."<p>"The other Outer Senshi," said Tsuki as a realization became<br/>clear on her face.<p>"Yes," said Setsuna with a small nod. "Come."<p>"What good will they do us?" snorted Tsuki. "Why didn't we<br/>wake them up sooner? We could have used their help a long time<br/>ago!"<p>"Us? Who said they would do us any good now?" replied her<br/>mother cryptically.<p>Tsuki frowned at this and snorted. "Whatever. Can we just<br/>go?"<p>Setsuna sighed lightly and opened the porthole. She stepped<br/>in without a word and her daughter followed.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: The Awakening!
