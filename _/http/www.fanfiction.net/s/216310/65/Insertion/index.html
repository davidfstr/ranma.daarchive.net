</div>Insertion<p>Part 65<p>The trip<p>++++++++++++++<p>Six Months later...<p>+++++++++++<p>Usagi stood in the shadows of the warehouse.<br/>Tall stacks of wooden crates and various boxes<br/>stood around her creating vast hallways through<br/>the building. It was dark and foreboding, but that<br/>didn't bother her at all. She could see as if she<br/>was standing in the middle of a park at noon on a<br/>bright sunny day. Still, she felt a small pang of<br/>fear. Not from the shadows, but from the three<br/>large men who sat around a card table with<br/>automatic weapons strewn about them with a deck of<br/>cards.<p>There were three of them, all of them sitting<br/>with their full attention on their hand. It was<br/>almost comical to look at, the largest of them<br/>frowned as he looked at his companions for a<br/>moment and scowled. The other was a man of medium<br/>build, and a skinny looking man with slicked back<br/>hair. They looked bored if anything else.<p>She crept silently up to the shadows closest<br/>to them, their table was lit with a single desk<br/>lamp, it was small, but dangerously bright.<p>"Youse gots any threes?" asked the biggest one<br/>dumbly.<p>"Go fish," grumbled the skinny man. He was<br/>irritated that his large companion didn't have<br/>enough brainpower for poker.<p>Sitting off to the side in a corner was a<br/>young girl, she was tied to a chair and had a<br/>handkerchief tied around her mouth as a gag. Her<br/>face was stained from tears that she had stopped<br/>producing a few hours earlier. Now she simply sat<br/>in silence and watched the men play their game. A<br/>small rodent moved up to her leg and she let out a<br/>muffled scream as she tried to shy away from the<br/>creature.<p>The men looked over at her and chuckled, one<br/>of them threw a notebook that was on the card<br/>table at the rat and it scurried away from her.<br/>They promptly returned to their game again.<p>"What should I do?" said Usagi as she frowned<br/>and looked at the scene for a moment.<p>"Well? What are you thinking?" asked a<br/>familiar voice as a face appeared in the air in<br/>front of her. She gasped in surprise quietly and<br/>scowled.<p>"Don't do that to me!" she whispered to her<br/>uncle's head.<p>"Oh? Did I surprise you?" he said cheerfully.<p>"Yes! What is it?" she snapped.<p>"I'm just checking up on you," he replied as<br/>cheerfully as ever.<p>She knew from experience that no one but her<br/>could see or hear him at the moment. "There's<br/>three of them, they've got a girl hostage."<p>"Hmmm, that sounds like the Kagami<br/>kidnapping," said Xellos as he looked thoughtful<br/>for a moment.<p>"Great, so I should save her," said Usagi as<br/>she peered around the boxes she was hidden behind<br/>for a moment and narrowed her eyes at the men.<p>"Sounds like a plan," said Xellos. "Well,<br/>actually it sounds more like an objective than a<br/>plan really."<p>"How should I do this? They've got a hostage,"<br/>she muttered as she mulled over the problem for a<br/>moment.<p>"It would seem that the girl is your first<br/>priority," said Xellos as he smirked at her.<p>"Right," agreed Usagi as she sighed. "I guess<br/>I should go get her, and then beat them up."<p>"Good idea," said her uncle.<p>Usagi sighed and started to move back into the<br/>shadows again, it took her two minutes to make her<br/>way to the other side of the building. She had to<br/>avoid the large area that they were sitting in,<br/>moving along the tops of the walls made it a<br/>little easier.<p>Finally, she landed and moved up behind the<br/>hostage. She was sitting right behind her and<br/>watching, cloaked in the shadows for the moment.<br/>With a smirk forming on her face she reached out<br/>and pulled the girl into the darkness.<p>The men sitting around the table stood up and<br/>turned to see nothing but an empty space where<br/>their hostage had once been.<p>"Da girl!" cried one of the men in shock.<p>His companions quickly armed themselves and<br/>rushed over to the spot, only to find empty<br/>shadows. They turned on flashlights and peered<br/>into the darkness with them, finding nothing but<br/>boxes.<p>"Oh shit," muttered one of the men quietly.<p>"Find her!" cried the skinny man angrily.<p>The big dumb one frowned and looked around for<br/>a moment. He sighed and started walking.<p>++++++++++++<p>"MMMMMFFFF!" screamed the frightened girl as<br/>Usagi pulled her onto the top of the wall of boxes<br/>near to where she had been. Her hand was keeping<br/>the sound muffled and she grinned at her with her<br/>finger up to her lips.<p>The girl calmed immediately as she saw who was<br/>standing in front of her. It was a blonde girl<br/>with a mask over her face, she was wearing what<br/>appeared to be a very short fuku with a pair of<br/>knee high boots. Her eyes turned confused and she<br/>gasped as the stranger pulled her gag away. "Who<br/>are you?"<p>"Shhhh. You'll find out in a moment. Just wait<br/>here, I've got to take care of those guys," said<br/>Usagi cheerfully. "This could be my big break!"<br/>she thought privately. The kidnapping was a high<br/>profile crime recently.<p>"Wait! They have guns!" whispered the girl<br/>fearfully as she reached for her savior.<p>"So? I've got something better," said Usagi as<br/>she smirked and jumped down into the darkness.<p>++++++++++++<p>"They can't have gotten far," snarled the<br/>skinny man as he found himself standing in the<br/>middle of a crossroads of sorts within the<br/>towering boxes. His two companions stood behind<br/>him and glanced around nervously.<p>"What if it's the cops?" whimpered the big<br/>one.<p>"The cops would have just barged in," said the<br/>medium build man as he scowled at him.<p>"Right. Still..." said the skinny one. "We<br/>should split up."<p>The others were about to agree when they all<br/>paused.<p>A bright light was shining in front of them,<br/>and standing in the middle, seeming to be the<br/>source was a young blonde girl.<p>"Villains who dare defile the sanctity of<br/>family! Your actions are evil, and your hearts<br/>black! Now the defender of love and justice shall<br/>punish you on! Sailor Moon!" cried the girl<br/>triumphantly as she posed in front of them.<p>The three men stood dumbly watching the scene<br/>for a moment in a sort of shocked awe. "What the?"<br/>said the skinny one. He promptly raised his weapon<br/>up and opened fire.<p>Usagi screeched as she jumped up and avoided<br/>the fire. She rose ten feet into the air and<br/>scowled at them as she hung there for a moment,<br/>suspended by several small ribbons from her<br/>costume that had latched onto the walls.<p>"Neat trick," said the big one dumbly.<p>"You'll pay for that! No one shoots at Sailor<br/>Moon!" screamed the girl as the ribbons let go and<br/>she fell to the ground.<p>The men trained their weapons when she landed,<br/>but as soon as she did the ribbons lashed out with<br/>a blinding speed. They were all disarmed and<br/>wrapped up within seconds. Usagi smirked at them<br/>and lifted them up into the air as she walked up<br/>to them.<p>They all looked at her fearfully as she<br/>grinned. "Now, what should I do with you?"<p>"Let us go?" asked the big one hopefully.<p>"Nah, this is gonna hurt," said Usagi calmly<br/>as her grin widened. Rows of spikes started to<br/>form along the bottom part of her ribbons and<br/>slowly moved towards the men. "Don't worry, they<br/>won't kill you," she added cheerfully. "You just<br/>won't be as pretty as you were before."<p>The men started to scream in terror as the<br/>spikes moved closer, they stopped suddenly when<br/>the lights came on inside the warehouse. She was<br/>blinded for a split second and shielded her eyes<br/>with her forearms.<p>"Well, if it isn't Sailor Moon," said a<br/>dangerously familiar voice.<p>Usagi whirled around and her three captives<br/>were flung into the wooden boxes. They slumped<br/>down out cold and Usagi growled as she saw someone<br/>standing on a catwalk above her with the girl held<br/>forcefully at his side. In his hand was a small<br/>ball of light. He looked to be about fourteen<br/>years old, with short brown hair and handsome<br/>features.<p>"Jadeite! I should have known you were behind<br/>this!" screamed the girl hatefully.<p>"Alas, too little too late," said the boy as<br/>he smirked at her. "You've been quite the thorn in<br/>my side lately. I think it's time I got rid of<br/>you."<p>"What?" said Usagi as she stepped back. A<br/>familiar growl sounded from the boxes around her<br/>and she narrowed here eyes. "This again?"<p>"Well Sailor Moon, what will you do?" asked<br/>Jadeite calmly as he pulled the girl along the<br/>catwalk.<p>Usagi stepped back as a large pile of boxes<br/>slowly rose and shifted shape into a humanoid<br/>creature. "These stupid things! Haven't you<br/>figured out they don't work by now?" she cried in<br/>frustration.<p>"It may not be able to kill you, but it will<br/>keep you busy long enough for me to make my escape<br/>and take this girl with me," said Jadeite calmly.<p>"Damn!" cried Usagi as she jumped away as the<br/>thing's arm slammed into the ground where she had<br/>been standing. "I don't have time for this!"<p>The creature lumbered forward and she jumped<br/>up and onto the wall next to its head. She stuck<br/>there and thrust her arm out behind her. The<br/>ribbons from her costume came to life again, this<br/>time trapping the creature in them by surrounding<br/>it on both sides. It struggled for a moment and<br/>she jerked her arm back. The wall opposite her<br/>came down slamming into the thing and shattering<br/>it. She snorted in disgust and jumped up onto the<br/>catwalk after avoiding the crash below her.<p>Jadeite turned to face her with a scowl on his<br/>face as she stood with a firm frown on her face<br/>and dozens of ribbons floating around behind her<br/>like the plumes of a peacock crossed with an<br/>octopus.<p>He snorted and released the girl, tossing her<br/>to the ground in front of him. "That didn't take<br/>as long as I thought it would."<p>"You won't escape this time," said Sailor Moon<br/>firmly as she stepped forward.<p>Jadeite grabbed the girl by her hair and<br/>growled. "Can you save her and catch me at the<br/>same time?" he cried as he tossed her over the<br/>side.<p>Usagi jumped down after her without a second<br/>thought, her ribbons wrapped around the girl and<br/>stopped her decent cold. She frowned as she hit<br/>something suddenly and groaned painfully.<p>"Ha ha ha ha! You're as foolish as I thought!"<br/>called Jadeite as he threw a ball of light into<br/>the ground at his feet. "We'll meet again soon<br/>Sailor Moon! I'm sure of it!" He vanished into<br/>thin air leaving her alone with the girl.<p>"Sooner than you think," growled Usagi.<br/>Jadeite had tossed the girl on top of one of the<br/>walls of boxes. She wouldn't have been hurt in the<br/>fall at all, but Usagi had dove headfirst into<br/>them, and managed to keep her from hitting<br/>anything at all. She rolled onto her back and<br/>looked up at the girl who was tangled in the<br/>ribbons and stared at her fearfully. "Are you all<br/>right?"<p>The girl nodded almost violently as she stared<br/>down at her savior in shock. "I'm fine," she<br/>whimpered.<p>"Good, let's get out of here," said Usagi with<br/>a heavy sigh.<p>+++++++++++<p>Usagi frowned, she had a large pout on her<br/>lips as she scowled at the image in front of her.<br/>She had dropped the girl off near a police station<br/>after tying up the kidnappers. Now she was<br/>standing on a rooftop in the Juban area. "Why? Why<br/>did you make me do that?"<p>"Because you need to keep your identity a<br/>secret," replied Xellos with a heavy sigh.<p>"Not that secret! People should know Sailor<br/>Moon is fighting evil bravely! I can't believe you<br/>made me make that girl promise to keep me a<br/>secret!"<p>"Well, what's done is done. You aren't good<br/>enough to keep away from the newspapers just yet.<br/>You still need more training before you can..."<p>"Oh fine!" said the girl as she crossed her<br/>arms and pouted again.<p>"Jadeite again?" asked Xellos with an odd look<br/>on his face.<p>"Yes, he doesn't know that I'm Sailor Moon,"<br/>said Usagi as she sat on the rooftop. "He's in my<br/>class Xellos, I should be able to stop him!"<p>"Well, we don't have any proof to incriminate<br/>him, and you can't just attack him in school,"<br/>said the man calmly.<p>"Why not? He's a jerk!" cried Usagi angrily.<p>"You know why," replied Xellos calmly.<p>"You always seem bothered by that guy," said<br/>Usagi as she frowned at him. "You never act this<br/>way."<p>Xellos turned his eyes away from her and<br/>sighed again. "It's not something I can explain<br/>easily. When the time comes, I'll tell you. Right<br/>now, it's not important."<p>"You know something!" cried Usagi as she<br/>seemed to realize it all at once.<p>"Nothing that will help you against him,"<br/>replied Xellos calmly.<p>"Who is he? How do you know him?" she said<br/>forcefully.<p>"Now that...is a secret," replied her uncle as<br/>his transmission ended.<p>"You jerk!" cried Usagi angrily.<p>+++++++++++++<p>On the other side of town...<p>The Shadow put his smoking weapons back into<br/>their holsters and turned away from the scene. It<br/>was an alleyway somewhere in the city, all around<br/>the cowering young woman were men in black suits.<br/>All of them were slumped to the ground and out<br/>cold. His cloak billowed dramatically as he moved<br/>away.<p>"Wait!" cried the young Chinese woman that he<br/>had just saved. "Come on! Give me something!"<p>"Miss Kung, you should be more careful. I am<br/>growing tired of saving you," said the<br/>intimidating figure coolly as he turned his head<br/>to look at her again.<p>"You asshole! It's been six months since we<br/>met! We should be dating by now and you won't even<br/>give me an interview!" screamed the young<br/>reporter as she stood in the middle of a broken<br/>pile of Yakuza.<p>"You read too many comic books," said the man<br/>as he vanished into the shadows again.<p>"Shit," grumbled the woman as she turned away.<br/>It had been an undercover assignment, and she was<br/>doing well. Well, the Yakuza made her think that.<br/>It had recently discovered who she was, and were<br/>going to kill her. Luckily the Shadow had decided<br/>to bust up an illegal drug ring that night. "I<br/>sure have been seeing a lot of him lately," she<br/>said as she looked up at the sky for a moment.<p>All at once she gasped and put her glasses on.<br/>"That's it! He must work with me! He's got to be<br/>one of the men I work with!" She walked away at a<br/>hurried pace and moved towards the street to catch<br/>a cab.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Carrot, you were right," said Ranma<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Following this chick is fun!" agreed Dan.<p>"She's certainly interesting," agreed Xianfu<br/>with a small sigh. "She'd be dead by now without<br/>us."<p>"Yeah, it was just a hunch I had after we<br/>saved her the first time," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"Really? I had the same feeling," agreed<br/>Ranma.<p>"So now what?" asked Dan casually as their<br/>costume shifted to street clothes and they turned<br/>female again.<p>"Well, I'm hungry," said Carrot.<p>"Me too," agreed Ranma.<p>"We should be getting home soon," said Xianfu<br/>with a slightly frustrated tone.<p>"Yeah, after we eat though," said Ranma.<p>"He's right," agreed Carrot. "We can stop on<br/>the way."<p>"Chinese?" asked Dan.<p>"What about that Thai place?" offered Carrot.<p>"Too spicy before bed," said Xianfu.<p>"Okay," said Ranma. "There's that Okonomiyaki<br/>place."<p>"Naw, not as good as Ucchan's, she's spoiled<br/>us," said Dan.<p>"You jerks are going to make us fat!" snarled<br/>Xianfu.<p>"Lay off, we'll never get fat as active as we<br/>are," said Carrot.<p>"He's right you know," agreed Dan.<p>"She's just mad because all this running<br/>around made us put on a few pounds of muscle,"<br/>pointed out Ranma.<p>"Jeez," muttered Carrot. "Do you know how many<br/>women would kill to look like us?" He adjusted<br/>their breast to illustrate that point.<p>"Right," grumbled the woman lamely. "We'll<br/>just go to that take out place on the way home. I<br/>don't feel like going out of our way tonight."<p>"Fair enough, but no more complaining that<br/>we're getting fat!" said Carrot.<p>"Man, we ate Chinese last night!" complained<br/>Ranma.<p>They happily argued their way back to the<br/>restaurant, and then back home again.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Wake up," said Yohiko as she scowled at her<br/>daughter. "You should be getting up on your own by<br/>now."<p>A mass of disheveled pink hair rose from the<br/>bed and two tired looking eyes glared up at her.<br/>"Mom."<p>"Stop talking and wake up," replied the woman<br/>as she left the room.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Morning Yotsuya," said Yusaku as he noticed<br/>the man walking through the halls of the<br/>apartments.<p>"Ah, you seem more cheerful than ever young<br/>Godai," said the man as he nodded to him. "Tell<br/>me, what do you plan to do with your Saturday?"<p>"Well, class is over, so I'm not sure,"<br/>replied the man cheerfully. He was dressed in a<br/>dirty looking dogi and had a smirk on his face.<br/>"You?"<p>"I believe Mrs. Itchinose is planning a<br/>meeting to discover the identity of our mysterious<br/>new tenant," said the man with a small nod. "To be<br/>held in your room this very evening."<p>"What? My room?" said the man as he hung his<br/>head. "Just bring your own beer tonight. I've only<br/>got one left, and it's mine."<p>"Hmmm, it seems I am saddled with the task of<br/>putting out the word," said the man as he nodded.<br/>"Do you plan to buy more?"<p>"Not until I get paid again," said Yusaku with<br/>a frown on his face. "You guys are still on about<br/>that?"<p>"Pardon?"<p>"Xellos," clarified Yusaku.<p>"Oh. Yes, it is most distressing," said the<br/>man. "A man of that age living with two young<br/>maidens. Surely the implications are enough to<br/>make you wonder."<p>"Naw. Xellos is weird, Miss Yohiko doesn't<br/>seem to like him much either. I'm just wondering<br/>why she puts up with him."<p>"Yohiko likes me fine," replied Xellos as he<br/>put his head between them.<p>"Ah, We were just speaking of you," said<br/>Yotsuya.<p>"Hello," said Godai as his face became<br/>serious.<p>"Good morning," said Xellos cheerfully.<p>"Tell me, where is your destination this fine<br/>day?" asked Yotsuya cheerfully.<p>"Shopping, it's my turn to cook," said the man<br/>as he looked at them.<p>"You cook with two women in your home?" said<br/>Yotsuya in mock surprise.<p>"Well, living here is no reason to get out of<br/>practice. Besides, Yohiko dear does require it."<p>"Ah, the things we do for love," said Yotsuya.<p>"Something like that," said Xellos with a<br/>smirk on his face.<p>"There is a meeting in Godai's room this<br/>evening? Concerning myself?" asked Xellos<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Indeed," said Yotsuya.<p>"Well, good luck solving the mystery. Good day<br/>to you," said the strange man as he walked away.<p>"I often hear noises from the home in the<br/>evening, but they are difficult to make out. It<br/>could be that Miss Hibiki is not a 'screamer',"<br/>said Yotsuya with a frown on his face.<p>"Or it could be that one of them likes to<br/>watch TV or listen to the radio at night," said<br/>Yusaku calmly as they watched the man leave the<br/>hallway.<p>"Curses, his ambiguity drives me to madness,"<br/>said Yotsuya as calmly as ever. "It worsens the<br/>matter that both of the Hibiki women will say<br/>nothing of this mystery to any of us."<p>"Speaking of ambiguity, what do you do for a<br/>living anyway?" said Yusaku as another smirk<br/>formed on his face.<p>"If you will excuse me," replied the man as he<br/>turned towards his room.<p>"I thought so," muttered Yusaku under his<br/>breath. "Jeez, it's been months, you'd think<br/>they'd have figured it out by now."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Yohiko sighed as she stared down at the<br/>television and frowned. "Man, Saturday is boring."<p>"Boring? I could call up Mitaka," said Usagi<br/>hopefully.<p>"Gah! Stop that!" cried the woman as she<br/>turned to glare at her daughter. The girl was<br/>making a sandwich, rather skillfully at that. It<br/>was a massive undertaking that had many levels and<br/>complex structures built into it.<p>"Usagi, I know you have to eat more with how<br/>active you are, but..." said Yohiko as she stared<br/>at the thing in front of her daughter.<p>"Huh? What is it?" said the girl as she looked<br/>up at her mother.<p>"You do realize that you have to put that into<br/>your mouth at some point, right?" said the woman<br/>as she turned away.<p>Usagi blushed and saw that it was becoming<br/>almost as tall as her whole torso. "Oh, right."<br/>She put the top layer of bread on and hefted it<br/>over to the table.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Yusaku frowned as he looked around his room<br/>and tossed his shirt over to the small pile of<br/>dirty clothes in the corner. He popped his neck<br/>and sighed as he stripped off his pants and stood<br/>in the middle of the room for a moment. He<br/>stretched his arms and began to search through his<br/>dresser for a new set of clothes.<p>"What do you mean knock? This is Mr. Flunk<br/>out's room," said a familiar voice as his door<br/>opened.<p>He turned his head and simply stared at the<br/>two women standing there looking at him for a<br/>moment. "Heh. Um...do you mind..."<p>"Yes," said Akemi as her cigarette hit the<br/>floor.<p>Itchinose turned away slowly and pushed her<br/>out of the room, closing the door behind her.<p>Outside, the pair conversed amongst<br/>themselves.<p>"When the hell did -that- happen?" cried<br/>Akemi as she simply stared at the floor for a<br/>moment.<p>"Wow, that kid sure has changed," agreed<br/>Itchinose.<p>The pair looked at one another and rushed over<br/>to the door, sliding it open just enough to peer<br/>in.<p>It opened in their faces and Yusaku was<br/>staring down at them calmly. "Are you two finished<br/>yet?"<p>Akemi marched into his room and pushed him<br/>back, forcing him to sit down in the middle of the<br/>floor. "Just sit here a minute."<p>He complied with a confused looking frown on<br/>his face. "What is it?"<p>Akemi picked up his arm and felt it for a<br/>moment.<p>"Well?" asked Itchinose.<p>"Hard as a rock," said the woman as she<br/>narrowed her eyes at him and began to feel on his<br/>back, lifting the back of his shirt up in the<br/>process. "Look at this!"<p>"Most unusual," said the older woman as she<br/>looked thoughtful.<p>"What is it?" said Godai in confusion.<p>"Shut up. We're trying to figure out when the<br/>hell you became a babe!" said Akemi.<p>"Is there some sort of air release valve?"<br/>asked Itchinose as she felt along his side.<p>"What?" said Godai dumbly.<p>He stood up and walked over to the mirror that<br/>hung from his wall. He blinked and looked at<br/>himself for a moment. "Well, what did you think<br/>would happen? I mean, I've been working out every<br/>morning for the past six months."<p>"Working out?" said Akemi dumbly.<p>"I thought you were taking some sort of<br/>aerobics class with Miss Hibiki," said Itchinose<br/>in confusion.<p>"It was martial arts classes, and what do you<br/>think martial arts classes are?" he replied<br/>calmly.<p>"Oh," said the two women in unison.<p>"Hey Godai," said Yohiko as she walked into<br/>the room and looked around.<p>"Huh?" he replied as he turned to face her.<p>"Training trip, get your stuff," she said<br/>simply before she walked out of the room.<p>He blinked for a moment and looked at the two<br/>women sitting in his room. They stared at one<br/>another and then looked back at him.<p>"Training trip?" they asked each other.<p>Yusaku was packed within a minute and walking<br/>out the door.<p>"I wish I was nicer to him now," grumbled<br/>Akemi as he left them.<p>"Well what do you know? Yohiko is smarter than<br/>I thought, rather than looking for a babe, she<br/>went and made her own," said Itchinose dumbly.<p>"Training trip indeed," said Akemi flatly.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Mom, where are we going?" asked Usagi as she<br/>found herself being herded into a cab with Yusaku.<p>"The mountains," replied the woman calmly.<p>"The mountains?" asked Yusaku dumbly.<p>"That's right," said the woman as she put<br/>their traveling bags into the trunk.<p>"The mountains?" asked a familiar voice from<br/>beside her.<p>Yohiko turned and looked Shun Mitaka in the<br/>face. He was watching the scene in confusion.<p>"Yeah," she said as she closed the trunk.<p>"Mind if I tag along then?" he said<br/>cheerfully. "I could give you a ride for free at<br/>the very least."<p>Yusaku started banging his head against the<br/>back of the front seat of the car.<p>"This isn't a vacation Mitaka, this is a<br/>training trip," she replied calmly.<p>"Training?" he asked in confusion. "What for?"<p>"I've been teaching Yusaku and my daughter<br/>martial arts," she replied calmly.<p>"Oh? Is that so?" he said cheerfully. "I've<br/>been taking some lessons myself."<p>"Really?" asked Yusaku as he stuck his head<br/>out of the back of the car.<p>Mitaka seemed surprised that he would be<br/>interested in that at all. "Yes, my mother thought<br/>it would be a good idea to take some karate. I've<br/>been doing it off and on since I was a boy. I just<br/>recently started again. I've got my second dan."<p>Yusaku actually got an impressed look on his<br/>face as he sat back in his seat again.<p>"Well, this isn't the same thing," replied<br/>Yohiko calmly.<p>"I'll tell you what, just take me to my place,<br/>I'll pay for the ride there, and we can go in my<br/>car," he said as he grinned at Yusaku.<p>Yohiko looked at her two students and smirked.<br/>"All right."<p>++++++++++++<p>Yohiko sat behind the wheel of the car with a<br/>grin on her face singing merrily as she drove into<br/>the wilderness.<p>"I found out, long a go. It's a long way down<br/>the holiday road. Holiday ro-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-<br/>oh-oad, holiday roa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oad!"<p>Yusaku and Usagi sat in the back seat looking<br/>rather cheerful as Mitaka blinked in surprise.<br/>"You can drive a car?"<p>"Sure," she replied as she looked at him. "Why<br/>wouldn't I know how?"<p>"No reason, I just didn't expect it," he said<br/>with a small shrug.<p>"First I knew of it," said Usagi.<p>"Well, I was a lot more active before I got<br/>married," said the woman cheerfully.<p>"That's obvious," said Mitaka with a small<br/>smirk on his face.<p>"Where is this place anyway?" asked Yusaku.<p>"Not far now," said Yohiko as she hummed her<br/>song to herself a little.<p>After about an hour she parked the car in a<br/>somewhat deserted parking lot in the middle of a<br/>small camping area. There were a few other<br/>families vacationing as well, but it was mostly<br/>deserted. School wasn't out for the year yet and<br/>the season for such activity was still a few<br/>months away.<p>"It's very pretty here," said Mitaka as he<br/>grinned at Yohiko suavely.<p>"Well, we aren't going to have time to enjoy<br/>the scenery much, take it in while you can," said<br/>the woman with a serious looking frown. "We've got<br/>a long walk ahead of us, so get your stuff.<p>+++++++++<p>Mitaka was miserable, the trio in front of him<br/>were still as fresh as they had been four hours<br/>ago. Every part of his body was aching and he was<br/>getting short of breath.<p>"This looks good," said Yohiko as she glanced<br/>around. They were standing in the middle of a<br/>large flat area on the side of the mountain. It<br/>was mostly a huge dirt patch. They could see for<br/>quite a ways in almost every direction to the<br/>south. The north was blocked from view by the wall<br/>of rock a short distance from where they had<br/>stopped.<p>"So we should set up camp?" asked Mitaka as he<br/>sat down on one of the rocks.<p>"Yes, we'll rest a bit while we're doing that<br/>and get started. We've still got a whole day ahead<br/>of us," said Yohiko with a wry looking grin on her<br/>face. She looked Mitaka up and down and turned<br/>away with an almost bored expression.<p>+++++++++++<p>It had taken about a half-hour to set up the<br/>campsite, they had taken their time and then sat<br/>around for another half-hour to rest up.<p>Mitaka seemed much more cheerful after they<br/>had started and Yusaku and Usagi were sitting on<br/>the edge of the cliff looking out at the scenery.<p>"Well, it's time to get started," said Yohiko<br/>cheerfully as she stood up and stretched.<p>"What are we going to do today?" asked Usagi.<p>"Spar," said the woman as she looked at them.<p>"Spar?" said the pair in confusion. They<br/>looked at one another and then back at the woman<br/>again.<p>"That's right, we're here to test your<br/>fighting ability," said the woman as she grinned<br/>at them for a moment.<p>"But, you haven't taught us anything about<br/>fighting," pointed out Yusaku. "We've been doing<br/>the same thing for six months now. All those<br/>exercises and stuff. Running around, carrying<br/>things, digging up weeds, construction work."<p>"You already know how to fight," said the<br/>woman as she smirked at him.<p>Usagi was strangely silent and simply looked<br/>at Yusaku for a moment.<p>"What?" said the boy dumbly.<p>"The motions and techniques of all the work<br/>you have been doing are all the training you need.<br/>You have the tools and the knowledge, you just<br/>need to apply it."<p>Usagi nodded and cracked her knuckles.<p>Mitaka looked confused. "Okay. So we'll spar."<p>"You'll be facing Yusaku," she said as she<br/>looked at him.<p>"Are you sure? I mean, I've been doing this<br/>for a while now," he replied with a small frown.<p>"Yes, go easy on him, and you'll lose," she<br/>replied calmly as she turned towards Usagi.<br/>"You'll fight me."<p>"Okay," she replied with a small shrug.<p>"I guess that's for the best, I'm sure Yusaku<br/>wouldn't feel comfortable fighting her. She's too<br/>young," said Mitaka.<p>"Why not?" said the man as he looked at Mitaka<br/>for a moment in confusion.<p>"What?" replied Mitaka dumbly.<p>"She's been doing the exact same thing I have<br/>for the past six months," he said with a shrug.<p>"Well, I..." Mitaka noticed the women were<br/>giving him slightly disgusted frowns and he wisely<br/>kept his mouth shut.<p>"We'll get started, you boys go first," said<br/>Yohiko with a smirk forming on her face.<p>Mitaka nodded and stood opposite Yusaku, the<br/>pair bowed to each other and took up stances.<p>Yusaku looked slightly unsure of himself, but<br/>his stance was firm. It looked somewhat sloppy<br/>though, he was wide open and mostly undefended.<p>Mitaka frowned slightly at this and refrained<br/>from commenting. In the back of his mind he was<br/>happy to have this opportunity. He could put a<br/>little fear into Yusaku without making himself<br/>look bad. That would make his chances with Yohiko<br/>better than before. "Gotta be careful, I can't<br/>hurt him," he thought to himself.<p>"Begin," said Yohiko.<p>Mitaka rushed forward taking the offensive<br/>immediately, he wanted to end it quickly and<br/>humble his opponent. That would make him easier to<br/>deal with in the future.<p>Yusaku stepped back nimbly and bent his back<br/>slightly to avoid the punch. Mitaka spun into a<br/>kick and gasped as it met the man's forearm and<br/>stopped cold.<p>Yusaku blinked and hit him in the chest.<br/>Mitaka's eyes went wide as he flew off of his feet<br/>and was thrown back ten feet into a nearby tree.<br/>He hit it hard and slumped down to the ground with<br/>a dazed looking frown. "Ouch."<p>"Mitaka!" cried Yusaku in alarm as he rushed<br/>over to his side. "I'm sorry! I didn't think I hit<br/>you that hard!"<p>The man looked up at his opponent, he was<br/>still slightly dazed and laughed to himself.<br/>"Huh?" He could see honest sincerity in his face.<br/>"What hit me?"<p>"I though you said you've been doing this for<br/>a while," said Usagi as she fell to her knees<br/>beside him.<p>"He has been, this is why I didn't want him<br/>coming along," said Yohiko as she walked up and<br/>looked down at him. She smiled and extended her<br/>hand.<p>Mitaka took it and allowed himself to be<br/>pulled to his feet. He shook his head and cleared<br/>it.<p>"What do you mean?" said Yusaku dumbly.<p>"The Hibiki school of Martial arts isn't a<br/>normal art. It's much more difficult to learn, and<br/>the hardships you endure are much more rigorous<br/>than those of most other arts."<p>"What?" said Usagi in confusion.<p>"Mitaka isn't exactly an expert, he probably<br/>spends an hour a day, maybe two or three times a<br/>week in a class. We've been spending four hours a<br/>day, plus all the extra training I've been putting<br/>you through on the side. The repairs to the<br/>building, the yard work, I've been making you both<br/>do outside of class..."<p>"Three times a week," said the man groggily as<br/>he wavered on his feet for a moment.<p>"Admirable, but the Hibiki style requires that<br/>you live for the art. It's more than a past time,<br/>it's a way of life."<p>Usagi gasped as she noticed the smirk on her<br/>mother's face, it looked almost malevolent.<p>"Stay for the whole weekend, and I'll do more<br/>for you than an entire month in that class will,"<br/>said the woman as she slapped the man on his back.<p>"So, should we spar now?" said Usagi.<p>"There's no need. I just wanted Mitaka to know<br/>where he stood here, and let Yusaku in on his<br/>abilities. You are already confident enough," said<br/>the woman as she smirked at her daughter. "The<br/>real training for you two is on the other side of<br/>the mountain."<p>The pair looked at one another as Yohiko led<br/>Mitaka towards a nearby boulder to sit for a time.<p>+++++++++++<p>Yusaku and Usagi blinked as they looked at the<br/>contraption in front of them. It was a pair of<br/>harnesses hanging from the trees.<p>"What is this?" said Usagi dumbly.<p>"Your training," said Yohiko flatly. "We've<br/>only got three days before we have to return."<p>"Three?" said Yusaku and Usagi in confusion.<p>"Monday is a holiday," said the woman with a<br/>small shrug.<p>"It is?" said Usagi.<p>"Yes, some teacher planning day or something.<br/>I've already called in," she said as she looked at<br/>them and smirked.<p>"What's this for?" said Yusaku as he looked up<br/>at the harness. Mitaka was standing a short<br/>distance away, frowning at the scene.<p>"This," Yohiko turned and walked over to a<br/>nearby boulder. She tapped it gently with her<br/>finger and it exploded in a shower of stone and a<br/>cloud of dust. "The Bakusai Tenketsu. It took me a<br/>week to learn, and you have two and a half days to<br/>get it right. You'll remain in these until you<br/>do."<p>Usagi and Yusaku looked at one another and<br/>then back at their sensei again.<p>++++++++++++<p>Mitaka was watching the scene in a sort of<br/>shocked awe. Usagi and Yusaku were hanging from<br/>the trees while two large boulders slammed into<br/>them repeatedly. They had started only ten minutes<br/>before, and the pair had already been knocked out<br/>twice each. They quickly woke up and started the<br/>process again.<p>Yohiko turned towards him and smiled. "Don't<br/>worry, this is the intermediate class. You're not<br/>ready for this yet."<p>"Intermediate?" said Mitaka in shock. "What<br/>are the advanced classes like?" he asked<br/>fearfully.<p>"Do you really want to know?" she asked<br/>cheerfully.<p>"No, not really," he admitted with his head<br/>hung low.<p>"Well, shall we get started?"<p>"Started?" said the man weakly.<p>++++++++++++<p>Mitaka was a heap of dead muscle. He couldn't<br/>move, he could barely speak, and he simply wanted<br/>to lie in silence until the pain stopped.<p>"Feeling better?" asked Yohiko as she sat down<br/>next to him with two cups of tea in her hands.<p>"Not really," he replied as he tried to sit<br/>up.<p>"I'll just leave this here then," said the<br/>woman cheerfully as she set his cup down next to<br/>him.<p>He closed his eyes and ignored the pain as he<br/>forced himself to sit upright and pick up the tea.<br/>It felt like it weighed thirty pounds in his<br/>hands.<p>The sky was now a sea of stars above them and<br/>they sat together in silence for a long time. He<br/>had spent the entire day digging holes, walking<br/>along low branches, and carrying large rocks<br/>around. There was more involved as well. They had<br/>found a waterfall with a large pool and he had<br/>spent an hour swimming around with a small boulder<br/>strapped to his back.<p>"Are you trying to get rid of me?" he asked<br/>quietly.<p>"In a way, but you did very well. You<br/>complained a lot less than those two did the first<br/>time they had to do that," she replied quietly.<p>"They did?"<p>"They've been doing similar things to what you<br/>just did for the past seven months or so," she<br/>said as she smiled at him for a moment.<p>Mitaka sighed and looked down at his hands for<br/>a moment. "The funny thing is, I believe you."<p>"Not so confident anymore?" she asked him with<br/>a tiny amount of amusement in her voice.<p>"Nowhere near what I was before. This<br/>was...very humbling." He didn't mention what<br/>Yusaku had done to him, but it was clear that it<br/>was what he was referring too.<p>Yohiko smirked as she realized that he hadn't<br/>said anything about when she had admitted that she<br/>was trying to get rid of him.<p>"Well, you've only got two more days left,"<br/>she said with a small shrug.<p>"Do I?" he said as he smiled at her again.<br/>Even that small act was painful for him.<p>"If you want to continue after that, you can,"<br/>she said with a shrug.<p>"I'm not going to give up, no matter what<br/>happens. I haven't lost yet," he said without<br/>looking up at her. He gulped his tea down and lay<br/>back down, looking up at the stars for a moment<br/>before closing his eyes.<p>He didn't notice Yohiko giving a small growl<br/>as her tin cup bent slightly out of shape in her<br/>grip. "Oh well. He'll learn soon enough, one way<br/>or another."<p>++++++++++<p>Yusaku screamed as he saw the stone rushing<br/>towards him, his arm cocked back and he thrust his<br/>hand forward to strike. His arm exploded in pain<br/>as the stone shoved it back and slammed into his<br/>body once again.<p>Usagi was hanging upside-down nearby with a<br/>painful frown on her face. "I'm getting tired,"<br/>she muttered.<p>"She said we had to stay here until we learned<br/>this," replied Yusaku as he took up a similar<br/>position.<p>"She's not here to watch us right now," said<br/>Usagi with a slightly disgusted frown.<p>"We're on the honor system Usagi, you know we<br/>should keep working," he said firmly.<p>"I know, but this still sucks," said the girl<br/>distastefully as she pulled herself upright again.<p>Yusaku followed suit and the pair began<br/>working again.<p>++++++++++++<p>Two more days pass...<p>+++++++++++<p>Yohiko frowned as Mitaka coughed up a lung full of<br/>water and wheezed as he lay sprawled out on the<br/>edge of the small pond. The boulder was still<br/>strapped onto his back and made breathing even<br/>more difficult, but he ignored it in favor of not<br/>moving at all.<p>"Well, had enough?" she said as she knelt down<br/>beside him.<p>"Never!" he growled as he stood up and<br/>staggered. He started moving forward again with<br/>determination burning in his eyes.<p>Yohiko shrugged and followed after him. After<br/>a moment they jogged into a familiar clearing,<br/>Mitaka promptly collapsed as his muscles failed<br/>again and did not move.<p>The woman arched her eyebrow in surprise at<br/>the scene she found herself looking at.<p>Yusaku was hanging upside-down, out cold and<br/>snoring loudly. The remains of his boulder lay<br/>shattered on the ground and he had a stupid<br/>looking grin on his face as he drooled in his<br/>sleep.<p>Usagi was cursing to herself and pushing her<br/>boulder back and fourth, repeatedly slamming it<br/>into her body in a frustrated rage. "No fair! No<br/>fair! Not fucking fair!" she screeched with each<br/>new attempt.<p>"Well whaddaya know?" said Yohiko as she<br/>pulled at the knot that left the man hanging and<br/>sent him into the ground. He didn't appear to<br/>notice and continued to sleep.<p>"I never thought he'd get it this time," she<br/>said as she looked at him and grinned.<p>"Really?" asked Mitaka dumbly.<p>"Naw, took me a week to learn this," she<br/>replied cheerfully as she kicked her slumbering<br/>student onto his back. "I figured it'd take him at<br/>least two, and probably not until he learned to<br/>control his chi a little more first. I'm honestly<br/>impressed."<p>Usagi growled at her mother's assessment. "You<br/>mean you didn't expect us to learn this?"<p>"Not this time," she admitted.<p>"Damn you!" screamed the girl in a rage. "Just<br/>for that I'm gonna learn it anyway!" She went back<br/>to her task and started in earnest.<p>"You'll never get it if you're this worked<br/>up," said her mother flatly.<p>Usagi growled, but calmed down considerably.<p>"Clear your mind, it's the only way to see the<br/>breaking point," said the woman as she turned away<br/>and started to drag Yusaku away.<p>"Wait, you mean...that's what I've been doing<br/>wrong?" said the girl as she looked surprised. The<br/>boulder decked her again as she finished saying<br/>this.<p>"What? You didn't know?" said Yohiko as she<br/>arched her eyebrow slightly.<p>"How was I supposed to? You never told us!"<br/>screamed the girl angrily.<p>"Oh, sorry," said Yohiko as she dragged Yusaku<br/>away with Mitaka.<p>++++++++++++<p>"You didn't tell them?" asked Mitaka as he lay<br/>against a log and frowned at the woman.<p>"I didn't want them to get it this time," she<br/>replied as she looked over at Yusaku. She had<br/>decided to let him sleep, he had stayed away for<br/>almost three days trying to learn the technique.<p>"What?" said Mitaka in shock, he sat up<br/>abruptly and immediately regretted it. He fell<br/>back down to the ground in pain and relaxed.<p>"The whole point of the Bakusai Tenketsu isn't<br/>the technique itself, but the extra toughness the<br/>training gives you," said Yohiko with a smirk on<br/>her face. "The move is essentially useless, it<br/>only works on rocks. It's good for distraction and<br/>intimidation, but not much else."<p>Mitaka looked at her in a sort of horrified<br/>awe. "You mean? They did all this for nothing?"<p>"Heh. Mitaka, after Yusaku wakes up, there<br/>won't be anything you can do to hurt him. He'll<br/>shrug off your strongest attacks as if they were<br/>the strikes of a baby. That is the secret of the<br/>Bakusai Tenketsu. It has nothing to do with the<br/>technique itself."<p>The man looked at his rival, someone who he<br/>considered to be nothing more than a mere boy.<br/>"I'm glad our relationship is somewhat friendly<br/>then. I may be his rival, but I still consider him<br/>a friend."<p>"He's a good one, I suggest you keep it that<br/>way," said the woman with a small shrug.<p>Mitaka nodded and lay his head back down<br/>again.<p>"We'll be heading back soon, I suggest you<br/>rest until then," she said as she looked in the<br/>direction where her daughter was still training.<p>"Do I still have a chance?" he asked her<br/>almost jokingly.<p>"Neither one of you ever had one. I've been<br/>trying to tell you that for a while now," was the<br/>reply.<p>"We'll see, I won't give up," he said with a<br/>rough sounding snort as he passed out finally.<p>Yohiko sighed. "These idiot men are going to<br/>get themselves killed over this." She stood up and<br/>walked towards the clearing where Usagi was<br/>training.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"I said you've done enough. It's time to go,"<br/>said the woman as she looked up at her daughter's<br/>angry face.<p>"No! I'm not done yet!" screamed Usagi angrily<br/>as she shoved at the boulder again.<p>"Usagi, that's enough. I didn't really think<br/>you would get it this time. I'm not angry."<p>"There's no way I'm gonna let Yusaku show me<br/>up!" snarled the angry girl as she continued to<br/>beat herself senseless.<p>"Usagi..." muttered Yohiko as she jumped up<br/>and touched the point on the boulder, sending it<br/>into shards all around the clearing. "That's<br/>enough. Let it go for now. I promise I'll let you<br/>take as long as you want next time. We have to go<br/>home, you've got school tomorrow."<p>The girl hung her head and turned away in<br/>shame.<p>"Don't even start Usagi," growled her mother<br/>as she undid the knot and sent her to the ground<br/>in a heap. "You've still got plenty of time ahead<br/>of you to learn this."<p>The girl looked up at her mother and sighed.<br/>"I guess you're right. I wanted to be your best<br/>student though!"<p>"I'd rather have two of them," she replied.<br/>"You'll find that in time, there are some things<br/>he will do better, but some things you will do<br/>better as well. This is just one of the things he<br/>has improved in more."<p>The girl looked confused. "What do I do better<br/>in then?"<p>"If I told you, you would focus only on those<br/>things, and fall behind in others," replied the<br/>woman as she put her arm across the girl's<br/>shoulders.<p>"I guess you're right," said the girl with a<br/>heavy sigh.<p>"Of course I am, I'm your mother. I'm right<br/>even when I'm wrong child," replied the woman<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Mooom..." whined Usagi.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"So, Mitaka. You thinkin about joining us?"<br/>asked Yusaku as he leaned forward from the back<br/>seat of the car.<p>The man looked at him and smiled slightly.<br/>They were all on their way home from the trip and<br/>had a good hour left to go before they made it<br/>back. "I don't think so."<p>"Huh? Why not?" asked Usagi.<p>Yohiko was smiling to herself and ignoring<br/>them as she drove the car.<p>"Yeah. You did real good," said Yusaku.<p>"I learned a lot on this trip," said Mitaka as<br/>he closed his eyes and sat back in his seat. "If I<br/>stayed with you I'd only drag you two down for a<br/>long time."<p>"You sure?" said Usagi with an uncertain<br/>looking frown.<p>"He's right. If he joined us now, I'd end up<br/>neglecting a lot of your training just to get him<br/>up to speed with you," said Yohiko suddenly. "He<br/>can join if he likes, but I don't think he's ready<br/>just yet."<p>"I will be," said the man firmly. "I hate<br/>missing a chance like this. I'd love to spend my<br/>mornings with the woman I love, but I'd be hurting<br/>the both of you."<p>Yohiko ignored them again and continued to<br/>smile blissfully as she watched the road. Yusaku<br/>turned his head away with an unreadable look on<br/>his face. Usagi seemed pleased with this<br/>declaration. Mitaka noticed the lack of a reaction<br/>on Yohiko and turned away as well.<p>"Maybe I've already missed my chance?" thought<br/>Mitaka to himself.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Stay on the right side of the road," growled<br/>Dan as he forced a slight correction on Carrot as<br/>they drove the car.<p>"Sorry, I'm still gettin used to this place,"<br/>grumbled the boy quietly.<p>"We'll watch your back," said Ranma calmly.<br/>"Just keep drivin."<p>"Yusaku is doing better than I'd thought,"<br/>said Xianfu seriously.<p>"Indeed, I never thought he'd get that<br/>technique, I just wanted to watch them suffer,"<br/>said Carrot.<p>"Yeah, it sure was fun torturing loverboy over<br/>there all weekend," agreed Dan.<p>"Indeed, he's a bit of an ass, but a nice<br/>guy," said Xianfu as she made them glance over at<br/>Mitaka when he wasn't looking at them. They caught<br/>Usagi grinning at this out of the corner of their<br/>eye and ignored her for the time being.<p>"We should do something about miss matchmaker<br/>too. This is getting annoying," said Carrot<br/>flatly.<p>"Right, she gets all excited when we so much<br/>as speak to the clerk at the grocery store,"<br/>agreed Dan.<p>"What can we do?" asked Ranma.<p>"Not much short of killing her or responding<br/>to one of these men," said Xianfu.<p>"Why does it sound like you don't think that's<br/>a bad idea?" said Carrot distastefully.<p>"I am a woman," she said coldly.<p>"Well, yer outvoted," said Dan with a small<br/>growl. "If it comes to a choice of the two, we<br/>kill Usagi."<p>"Don't even joke about that!" cried Pissant<br/>and Xainfu at the same time.<p>"Really, you people shouldn't be so mean to<br/>our friends!" said Pissant.<p>"Who's being mean? We're giving them<br/>legitimate training," said Carrot.<p>"You don't have to enjoy it so much," said<br/>Pissant irritably.<p>"That's part of being a master," said Xianfu.<br/>"If any of you even suggest killing my daughter<br/>again..."<p>"Oh, she's your daughter all of a sudden? What<br/>about us?" snapped Carrot.<p>"You treat her like a plaything!" snapped the<br/>woman. "Myself and Ranma are the only ones who act<br/>like parents at all!"<p>"Look, we all know we all like the brat," said<br/>Dan.<p>"What about me?" said Pissant.<p>"You just complain, you don't do anything<br/>else. That's not being a parent," said Ranma<br/>flatly.<p>"That wasn't very nice," whimpered the voice.<p>"At any rate, we need to do something about<br/>both these idiots. It's obvious they're not going<br/>to leave us alone on their own. Yusaku ain't as<br/>bad as he used to be, but still," said Carrot<br/>flatly.<p>"Yeah, but what?" said Dan.<p>"I dunno, we'll figure something out,"<br/>muttered Ranma.<p>"What? I happen to think the attention is<br/>flattering," said Xianfu.<p>"Yeah, up to a point. These two idiots are<br/>obsessing. I know Yusaku's had other offers he's<br/>refused because of us. Mitaka as well. They need<br/>to get on with their lives without us."<p>Carrot caught them looking into the rear view<br/>mirror at the sleeping Yusaku and taking glances<br/>at Mitaka. "Stop that you perverted witch!"<p>"What's wrong with it? I'm a woman aren't I?"<br/>replied Xianfu.<p>"We ain't," countered Dan.<p>"You're being selfish," said Pissant.<p>"What? You're siding with her?" said Carrot<br/>flatly.<p>"No! But if she just want's to look it's okay.<br/>As long as we don't have too..." said the voice<br/>pathetically.<p>"I can't believe you pigs! After all you've<br/>made me do? What about Hotaru?" snapped Xianfu<br/>angrily.<p>"What about her? She ain't here, and we were<br/>married," said Dan flatly.<p>"Do you think I enjoyed having to be there<br/>for...that?" snapped the woman hatefully.<p>"Probably," said Carrot as he scratched their<br/>ear for a moment and continued to watch the road.<p>"Hey lady, we ain't screamers," said Dan with<br/>a small chuckle.<p>"Well, maybe I did a little, but it didn't<br/>feel right!" admitted the woman bitterly. "I'm a<br/>woman and I need a man!"<p>"Lady, we all have to agree on some things,<br/>and that's one of em. No men," countered Dan<br/>flatly.<p>"Pigs!" snapped Xianfu. She went silent and<br/>left them to themselves.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"So, how was the trip?" asked Xellos<br/>cheerfully as he sat and looked at Yohiko with a<br/>wry grin on his face.<p>"Could have been better," said the woman in<br/>reply.<p>"Oh?"<p>"We had a disagreement with ourselves," said<br/>Yohiko calmly.<p>"Well, it wasn't the first time I imagine,"<br/>said Xellos as he seemed to lose interest<br/>suddenly.<p>"Or the last," agreed Yohiko. "I'm goin to bed<br/>now, it's been a long day."<p>"See you in the morning," said Xellos<br/>cheerfully. She vanished into her room and left<br/>him alone. He narrowed his eyes and smirked to<br/>himself as he called up a small image in front of<br/>himself. "Usagi? Let's see what you're up to." He<br/>paused, for a moment he thought he heard a small<br/>giggle in the back of the home. The sound and<br/>whatever made it was gone now, and he returned to<br/>his entertainment.<p>His grin widened at what he saw and he leaned<br/>forward. "Oh, this is certainly interesting."<p>+++++++++++<p>Sailor Moon stood with a dangerous looking<br/>creature standing over her. She was in an alleyway<br/>and the large wolf monster loomed over her.<br/>Jadeite stood on a nearby rooftop laughing to<br/>himself. "Well, it seems I have you this time<br/>Sailor Moon!"<p>"I'll get you yet villain!" screamed Usagi<br/>angrily as she dodged another strike from the<br/>monster's claws. She was thrown into the wall as<br/>the creature used her distracted moment to<br/>backhand her.<p>She grunted from the impact and quickly moved<br/>to her feet. After a moment of surprise from the<br/>lack of pain, she jumped into action again. The<br/>creature dodged skillfully around her ribbons and<br/>kept her on her toes for almost two minutes.<p>After that time, she made a mistake and<br/>tripped over a small metal can in the alley. The<br/>monster lunged forward with its fangs bared.<p>"No!" cried the girl as she braced herself for<br/>the blow. It never came. There was a dull sounding<br/>thud and the ground under her feet vibrated for a<br/>moment. "Wha?"<p>"Are you all right Sailor Moon?" said a<br/>familiar voice.<p>"Ryoga?" she muttered dumbly as a familiar<br/>figure stood on top of a nearby dumpster with a<br/>scowl on his face.<p>"We need to stop meeting like this," he said<br/>as he looked down at her with a short nod. He<br/>turned his head up at Jadeite as he scowled at<br/>them. "You! How dare you attack a young girl with<br/>that thing!" He pointed at the dazed monster for<br/>a moment in anger. "I won't forgive you! Jadeite,<br/>prepare to die!"<p>Usagi snarled as she realized the creature was<br/>still surprised from the appearance of the<br/>umbrella that was now embedded into the pavement.<br/>Her grin went wild and her ribbons lashed out<br/>suddenly. This time, the ends of them had formed<br/>into very sharp looking barbed spikes. The monster<br/>howled in pain as they tore into its flesh and<br/>began to rip through its body. It vanished in a<br/>swirl of shadows. She rose to her feet and looked<br/>up to see Ryoga jumping towards her enemy. "No!<br/>Look out!"<p>"Pest!" snarled Jadeite as he threw a ball of<br/>light into the ground and vanished, leaving the<br/>lost boy alone on the rooftop.<p>"Damn, he got away!" snarled Ryoga as he<br/>jumped back down onto the street. He plucked his<br/>umbrella out of the pavement and looked at the<br/>young girl in front of him.<p>"I'm fine!" said Usagi as she blushed and<br/>stepped closer to him. "Thank you for saving me."<p>"You should be more careful, that man is<br/>dangerous," said Ryoga as he turned away from her.<p>"I have to stop him, no one else will do it,"<br/>said Usagi as she suddenly steeled herself.<p>"I understand. I had someone like that once."<br/>Ryoga turned to face her again. "Good luck."<p>Usagi pushed herself into his chest and they<br/>kissed for a moment. She closed her eyes and felt<br/>her lips suddenly become cold. She blinked and<br/>realized that he had vanished as mysteriously as<br/>he had appeared. The same as always. "Damn." She<br/>turned away and left the alley.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ryoga sat down on a rooftop a short time<br/>later. He was simply watching the moon in silence.<br/>"Damn. That girl...she..." He turned his head in<br/>disgust. "I've never had anyone treat me like she<br/>does. Not even Akane, or Akari..." He growled in<br/>frustration. "She'd never accept my<br/>curse...but...Damn." He shook his head in<br/>frustration and disgust with himself. "I can't<br/>keep doing this, Akane needs me, and Akari...why<br/>can't I just...Damn, Ranma...I'm starting to<br/>understand you now." He stood up and jumped away,<br/>vanishing into the streets. "Not that I'm going to<br/>forgive you for doing that to Akane though," he<br/>added as a final thought.<p>++++++++++++<p>Yusaku Godai lay on his back staring at the<br/>ceiling. It had been a long day, but he had<br/>finally succeeded in the end. His grin widened as<br/>he thought about how things had turned out. Even<br/>Yohiko hadn't expected him to do so well. "She<br/>must be very proud of me," he said to himself.<p>"Oh, I am, very proud. You're coming along<br/>much better than I had thought."<p>He sat upright and gasped in shock. He hadn't<br/>even heard his door open. She was standing in the<br/>doorway, closing it behind her.<p>"Miss Yohiko," stammered Yusaku dumbly.<p>"Shhh, you have to be quiet or you'll wake the<br/>others," she said calmly as she stepped forward.<br/>She was wearing a robe, and it was loosely tied.<br/>It was quite obvious that there wasn't anything<br/>under it.<p>He simply sat there and stared, unable to<br/>move.<p>"Yusaku, I need something from you," she said<br/>as she knelt down at his feet and looked into his<br/>eyes.<p>"Anything," he managed to mutter.<p>"Good boy," she replied as she stood up and<br/>removed her robe.<p>Yusaku almost passed out cold as she fell to<br/>her hands and knees and crawled over his body. She<br/>moved slowly until she was looking him dead in the<br/>face and smiled. He couldn't move at all and was<br/>shaking quite badly.<p>"Just a moment," she said to him. Her leg<br/>lashed out and knocked over his dresser, covering<br/>the hole in his wall. There was a tiny muttered<br/>curse from the other room. "Now, be a good boy and<br/>stay quiet. We have to be careful."<p>He nodded numbly as she slowly started to<br/>remove his clothes.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Morning, a quiet chirping of birds and an<br/>irritating beam of sunlight. That was all they<br/>knew at the moment.<p>"What's that smell?" muttered Carrot as he<br/>groggily woke up from his slumber. He turned his<br/>head and froze. "Oh shit."<p>A familiar face stared back at him with an odd<br/>looking grin. Yusaku was still sleeping, and had<br/>the blissful glow that all men have when they've<br/>just...<br/>"<br/><br/>HHHHHHHHHH!"<p>TBC...<p>BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAA!<p>Let's see how this one sits with ya! Heh.<p>
