</div>First off, a little Question and answer session.<p>Q: Where's the new part of Rain?<p>A: I haven't forgotten Rain, but the new chapter is coming slowly<br/>along. I'm working out a few details about what's going to happen over<br/>the last part of the story. When I get it all worked out, you'll see<br/>the rest of it. [Not Writers block, I'm just plotting it out<br/>carefully.]<p>Q: Why are you working on this then?<p>A: Cause I feel like it. Leeme alone.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Insertion<p>Part 16<p>Big Business<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome sat in front of two elderly men. They were inside a<br/>large office on the top floor of a skyscraper in Tokyo. He had a<br/>briefcase resting in his lap, and a smug looking grin on his face. One<br/>had a long gray beard, and an intimidating appearance about him. The<br/>other was twenty years younger and had a thick set of eyeglasses on,<br/>both were dressed in business suits. The man with the beard was<br/>sitting behind a large intimidating desk.<p>"Where did you get this?" said the two men as they both peered<br/>down at the large holographic image that was generated by a small<br/>machine in front of them. Basically, a television from the silver<br/>millenium, created by scientist from the planet thousands of years<br/>before.<p>"I confiscated it from some visitors from out of the country,"<br/>replied Ranma calmly.<p>"You stole it?" said the man with a frown on his face.<p>"Now that is a secret," replied the boy with a small wag of his finger.<br/>"However, the original owners will not be looking for it anytime soon."<p>One of the men looked uncomfortable with this and sat back in his<br/>chair. "How do you know this?"<p>"Because they have been dead for some time now," replied the boy<br/>with a small shrug.<p>"I suppose I could buy it from you," replied the other man with a<br/>sour looking frown as he stroked at his beard calmly. "I'll give you<br/>sixty million yen."<p>Ranma snorted in disgust. "Right. I give you that for a drop in<br/>the bucket? The patents involved with just the parts in that machine<br/>alone will ensure your business for decades. If you release them<br/>slowly, a piece at a time, you will quickly become the most powerful<br/>force in the technology industry. I'm not a fool."<p>The man with the glasses narrowed his eyes at the boy and frowned.<br/>"You claim to have murdered the original owner of this, and now you<br/>make demands? You should be so lucky I offered that much."<p>"I said he was dead. I never claimed that I killed him," replied<br/>the boy calmly. "How I got my hands on that is my business. I've got<br/>several offers from your competitors already. If you don't meet my<br/>demands, all of which were very nearly met by your competitors by the<br/>way, I will leave."<p>"And what are your demands?" snorted the old man bitterly.<p>"Fifteen percent of your stock, and twenty billion yen," replied<br/>Ranma coldly.<p>"Are you insane?" snapped the bearded man as he jumped out of his<br/>seat.<p>"No? Oh, I suppose I'll just sell this to the man who offered me<br/>ten percent, and nineteen billion yen. I hope your company can survive<br/>against someone who's putting out that kind of technology..."<p>The old man stared down at the device hatefully. It was no bigger<br/>than a CD player, the image looked real enough to touch, and the disks<br/>it played were no larger than a quarter. They were capable of holding<br/>information thousands of times greater than a DVD disk according to the boy.<br/>Those two patents alone could do more than make up the loss in capital in just<br/>one year. The power supply was unlike anything he had seen before<br/>either. It looked a bit like a fuse, but held a brightly glowing light<br/>inside<p>"I don't believe this..." he muttered under his breath.<p>"I'm not interested in taking over your company. I'll liquidate<br/>the stocks once I'm satisfied with the gains this technology will make<br/>over the next few years. I've got plans of my own, and can't be<br/>bothered with marketing this myself," said Ranma with a cold smile on<br/>his face. "So, I'm selling it to the highest bidder."<p>The old man chuckled to himself, nodding his head. "I like you.<br/>I'll match the other offer, plus tack on two percent to the stock.<br/>You've got a bright future ahead of you young man. I'd offer you a<br/>job, but you're to wealthy for that now."<p>"That's nice to know, but I'm not an idiot," said Ranma coolly.<br/>"Have your secretary send in the man who accompanied me."<p>The old man arched his brow at this and pressed a button on his<br/>desk. "Midori, send in the other gentleman please."<p>After a few moments Jadeite walked into the room. "You summoned<br/>me?" he commented with a slight smirk on his face.<p>"I'm still a minor, you'd have refused the stock options and<br/>probably the money as well. You'd have sited that the contract was<br/>invalid," said the boy with a small shrug.<p>"Everything will go in this man's name, just to ensure that you<br/>don't try and refuse payment later on," said Ranma with a small<br/>chuckle.<p>"The paperwork may take some time, a few days..." started the old<br/>man.<p>"You have one hour. I think I'll wait here," said the boy calmly<br/>as he crossed his arms. "Don't treat me like I'm some green moron, old<br/>man."<p>The younger man turned completely red in anger and clenched his<br/>fists. "How dare you?"<p>"Calm down," said the old man calmly. "This is too much for us to<br/>pass up. It's obvious that this technology isn't from this planet.<br/>There's too much for it to be some secret project from a competitor,<br/>or even something he stole from the military."<p>"You're smarter than you look old man," said Ranma calmly as he<br/>smiled at him.<p>Jadeite narrowed his eyes at them for a moment.<p>"Yes, and you are a fool. You realize that this room is always<br/>under surveillance? I have this entire conversation recorded in<br/>countless ways. More than enough to convict you of espionage,<br/>blackmail, and numerous other small crimes, possibly including<br/>murder." The old man gave them a passing smirk. "I think sixty million<br/>is a nice sum, don't you agree?" The old man looked up to his lackey,<br/>who was now grinning back at him.<p>"Fool," snorted Ranma calmly. "You don't think that's the only<br/>thing I confiscated do you?"<p>"I don't see how that can help you," said the old man coldly.<p>"I think it can, Jadeite," said Ranma coolly.<p>The former youma general pulled a sleek looking weapon from his<br/>coat. It looked like a handgun from some old sci-fi movie.<p>Both men froze where they stood.<p>"I wouldn't hit the panic alarm hidden under your desk either,"<br/>said Ranma. He pointed at the silver tie pin on his clothes. "That<br/>weapon is a rather nasty way to die. It vaporizes your entire body<br/>rather slowly. It leaves no bodies behind, and no projectile. Show him<br/>Jadeite."<p>The man merely nodded, and shot the computer that was sitting on<br/>the man's desk. A small ball of energy flashed from the weapon's<br/>barrel, and began to burn its way slowly across the plastic. Slowly,<br/>the computer vanished away, leaving only a few wisps of smoke behind.<p>The old man gasped in shock and horror.<p>"This tie pin, is a cloaking device. It prevents my voice from<br/>being recorded, and my picture from being taken clearly. I'm nothing<br/>but a bunch of white noise, and some weird looking blobs of black on<br/>any surveillance you might have."<p>"This is..." stammered the younger man as he moved between Jadeite<br/>and his boss.<p>"Calm down. I'm not threatening you. If you want us to leave, we<br/>will, but we're taking that with us. You just need to understand where<br/>you stand in respect to threatening me. You see, I can kill you<br/>without leaving a shred of evidence behind. I'm not interested in<br/>that, what I want is a business deal. If you aren't willing, I'll go<br/>somewhere else."<p>The old man looked at his companion and sighed. "Stand down. I<br/>shall...comply."<p>Ranma smiled cheerfully. "Good! I'm glad to hear that! Shall we<br/>start the paperwork?"<p>++++++++++<p>"Are you sure that was necessary?" grumbled Jadeite irritably.<p>"Calm down, it's not like we haven't done it six times today,"<br/>replied Ranma. "None of the other companies even remember that we<br/>were ever there."<p>"Fine, but still. Why my name?"<p>"Simple, we're going to divide the money and stocks up between the<br/>four of you," replied Ranma with a shrug as they walked down the<br/>street. "I want you in charge of the stocks though."<p>"What about you?" said the man with a small frown.<p>"I'm going to wait until I'm old enough to own property. This<br/>money isn't just to live comfortably you know. We're going to need a<br/>base of operations for one. Transportation would be nice too."<p>"Company cars?" muttered Jadeite.<p>"Right," said the boy calmly in reply.<p>"So? We don't have to worry about money then," said Jadeite with a<br/>small nod.<p>"Right, that was the point. Now we don't have to worry about<br/>finding jobs, we can build a client base and work only choice jobs.<br/>It'll make us look elite, we'll overcharge and pick our work. That'll<br/>free us up for other things, like our real mission."<p>"Why bother with the security thing at all then?" said Jadeite in<br/>confusion.<p>"Mostly too keep the Tendos and Genma from getting suspicious.<br/>We've got access to a lot of money. I'm still a minor, so having a<br/>bank account of my own is dangerous with that fat leech around. That's<br/>why I need you for this. The four of us are going to have a joint<br/>account."<p>"Right, I get it," said Jadeite calmly.<p>"The business is also a cover for the government," said Ranma with<br/>a smirk on his face. "We're going to pay taxes, get the licenses<br/>required, and everything else. We're even going to hire a few men to<br/>take care of jobs while we're doing the real work."<p>"How can I have a bank account? I don't exist," said Jadeite with<br/>a small frown.<p>"Nephrite already took care of that, he should have everything you<br/>need for identification ready by now. All that stuff is computerized<br/>now, and with the mercury computers..."<p>"Right, too easy I suppose," snorted the man.<p>"You've got it," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"So, where's this base?" asked Jadeite.<p>"There," said Ranma as he pointed at a skyscraper nearby. "We're<br/>going to rent out one floor. You guys are going to need housing too,<br/>that hotel isn't cutting it."<p>"Tell me about it," muttered Jadeite irritably.<p>"We can afford something a little better than normal folks," said<br/>Ranma cheerfully.<p>"You too?" asked Jadeite.<p>"No. I think I'll stay where I'm at until I finish school," said<br/>Ranma with a small smirk.<p>"We're going to set up the teleporter then?" said Jadeite<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Yup," said Ranma as he nodded in reply. "Come on, I'm hungry."<p>+++++++++++<p>Hikaru Gosunkugi sat in his room, staring at the wooden mask. It<br/>rested in his palm as he sat on his bed and simply looked into the<br/>eyes. "I don't know why I even kept this thing. It just makes me<br/>remember those guys." He snorted and tossed it onto the sheets as he<br/>laid back and spread out his body over the mattress.<p>"If only one of these spells would work," he grumbled as he looked<br/>over at the rows and rows of books that sat inside a small bookcase.<br/>All of them were useless, even the ones he recently acquired about<br/>voodoo. "Then I'd show em. I bet even Akane would notice me."<p>He frowned and rolled onto his side, staring at the wall<br/>hatefully. "This stinks."<p>That was when something caught his eye. The mask was now face down<br/>on his sheets, and a strange shimmering could be seen on the inside.<br/>He lifted it up in his hands and frowned as he looked at it.<p>"What is this? What's this thing made of?" He pulled it closer, to<br/>get a closer look at the strangely shining interior of the mask.<p>That was when it reached out and grabbed his face. He screamed and<br/>pulled at it desperately, but it clung on, moving onto his head more<br/>firmly. Flailing about desperately he fell off of his bed and rolled<br/>across the floor. His screams died down as he ripped it away and<br/>tossed it across the room. He sat on the floor, staring at it in<br/>horror. "What the hell?"<p>"Hikaru! Hikaru dear? Are you all right?" said his mother's voice<br/>from outside the door. She knocked quietly and tried the knob,<br/>naturally it was locked.<p>"I'm fine! Just a bad dream!" he called.<p>"Are you sure?" said his mother in a worried tone.<p>"Yeah, it's over now," he muttered more to himself than her.<p>"Okay. If you're sure," she said as she turned away and left him.<p>"What is that thing?" muttered the boy as he stood up and<br/>scrambled over to the other side of the bed, staring at it in horror.<br/>He stayed that way for a long time. Finally he mustered up enough<br/>courage to throw a shirt over the top of it. He then lifted it into<br/>his arms and tossed it into his closet, slamming the door shut. He<br/>leaned against it panting for breath for another long moment. "You can<br/>stay in there for a while, until I figure out how to get rid of you."<p>++++++++++<p>Hotaru smiled up at her sensei as she fought with him in the back<br/>yard. Naturally, he was going easy on her, but she still put up a good<br/>fight despite the difference in size and power. It was nothing more<br/>than light sparring to him, but a full blown workout for the little<br/>girl.<p>Ranma smirked as he tossed a few new things at her in the mix of<br/>blows. She countered them without missing a beat and he jumped away.<br/>"Very good."<p>"Thank you Saotome-sensei," said the girl with a polite bow.<p>He walked up to her and she jumped into the attack again, her face<br/>growing ice cold. "Haaaa!"<p>"What the?" muttered Ranma as he backed away from the assault. "I<br/>didn't teach her this!"<p>"You bastard!" she said coldly. "What do you think you're doing<br/>here?"<p>"Hotaru?" muttered the boy dumbly.<p>Ranma countered a quick strike to his groin and jumped away with<br/>his eyes growing wide in surprise. "No! Saturn! What's she doing up?"<p>Carrot and Dan both voiced surprise at this. Ranma pushed them<br/>away and jumped down into the yard. "Saturn."<p>"Genaku," she replied with her cold smile growing a bit larger.<p>"Well, it has been a while," said the boy with a small nod.<p>"Of course it has, we've been dead for a while," retorted the girl<br/>calmly.<p>"So, you're waking up are you? You shouldn't just yet," said Ranma<br/>with a smirk on his face. "Beryl isn't even dead yet."<p>"You've been hanging around the senshi of Pluto too much," she<br/>replied curtly.<p>Ranma chuckled at this and shook his head. "Well, I suppose I<br/>have. Not much choice in the matter actually."<p>"I'm not fully merged with this girl yet," said Saturn with a<br/>small frown. "I shouldn't be talking to you, according to her anyway."<p>"Well, we both know what I think of her predictions," said Ranma<br/>with another chuckle. "So, how've you been?"<p>"This world is pleasant enough," replied the girl with a small<br/>shrug. "How is my favorite Uncle doing?"<p>"Oh? I'm your favorite? I always thought you liked Jadeite. He was<br/>the one who took care of you when you were on Earth. Reading you<br/>stories, putting you to bed, keeping you out of the older senshi's<br/>hair..."<p>"True, but the only time I had any real fun was when I was with<br/>you," said the girl with her cold smile growing a bit more.<p>"Aye, I remember that," said Ranma with a cold glare of his own.<br/>"Good times those were."<p>"You taught me the value of a good fight, and how to enjoy the<br/>looks on our enemy's faces when we ate their comrade's hearts."<p>"Well, 'twas only that one time..." muttered Ranma with a slight<br/>blush. "Serenity gave me a right nasty tongue lashing for that<br/>episode..."<p>"Not that it stopped you," said the little girl with a small<br/>chuckle. She paused and stared at him for a moment. "We have eaves<br/>droppers?"<p>"Aye, three of the bastards. Livin inside me head they are. Can't<br/>figure out how the bloody hell they got in. Oh well, they're bright<br/>lads. One after me own heart, one too smart for me own good, and the<br/>other..."<p>"The other?" asked Saturn with her eyebrow arched slightly.<p>"I'd just as soon be rid o him," snorted the man calmly.<p>"Hey, you ain't the only one not happy with this arrangement you<br/>know," said Ranma to himself.<p>"Well, you seem to be quite the little community," said Hotaru<br/>calmly as she turned around for a moment.<p>"Just think of us as his annoying room mates," said Ranma with an<br/>unusual smirk on his face.<p>"Do you have any idea who I am boy?" said Saturn as she turned to<br/>glare at him.<p>"Yeah. Senshi of Saturn, bringer of silence and all that. Big<br/>whoop," said Ranma as he raised his hands into the air in a sarcastic<br/>gesture.<p>"I could destroy you with a thought," she snarled.<p>"Not without killing your old friend too," commented the boy as<br/>his face changed into a hard frown. "I doubt if you'll destroy an<br/>entire planet just to kill me. You'll find hitting us with anything<br/>less more difficult than you think."<p>"Heh, no fear at all," said Saturn as her face suddenly became a<br/>bright smile. "I like this one, or is it two of you?"<p>"Pissant hasn't said much," said Ranma casually. "This is an<br/>interesting development though. Planning on joining your girlfriends?"<p>"Hardly. Those twits are letting Pluto lead them around as if she<br/>had a leash on them. I won't be a part of that, I am beyond her scope<br/>of influence."<p>"That's good to hear. I'd offer to let you work with us, but daddy<br/>wouldn't like that much," said Ranma with a smirk forming on his face.<br/>"Maybe later, but for now. I think you should go back to playing<br/>little girl."<p>"I'm not playing. The girl Hotaru, has not realized that I exist<br/>yet. Think of me as a split personality of sorts. I'm the memory<br/>stored away in the back of her mind. I don't know what woke me up, but<br/>I shouldn't be like this. I should have gradually merged with her over<br/>time, never realizing my own consciousness."<p>"I can think of a few reasons, and they're all my fault," said<br/>Ranma with a small nod.<p>"Oh?" said the girl with a slightly questioning frown.<p>"Contact with that chi ball could have done it, or even just the<br/>training itself. You using your powers before Mistress Nine tried to<br/>take over your body could have done it as well."<p>"Using my powers?" said the girl as she arched her eyebrow yet<br/>again.<p>"Yeah. Three boys found dead on your route to school about two<br/>days ago. Broken hand, dislocated finger, and a knife wound to the<br/>leg. None of the wounds were fatal, but they died somehow anyway. I<br/>believe their hearts exploded."<p>"I though it best that the child didn't know about that," said<br/>Saturn with a small nod.<p>"Good idea," said Ranma with a smirk on his face. "Taking them out<br/>was a good idea too, they probably would have tried again for revenge.<br/>They seemed like the type."<p>"I thought it was best to eliminate them, just in case. I couldn't<br/>be sure if I could have surfaced again. It was better not to risk it,"<br/>agreed the girl with a small nod.<p>"I agree, but I doubt if you're just going to go away," said Ranma<br/>with a smirk on his face. "Be more careful in the future. We don't<br/>want to attract a lot of attention."<p>Hotaru just smiled at him and nodded. Deep down she knew that she<br/>was just posing at the moment, and she hated that. It had taken all of<br/>her power just to eliminate those boys. Using her other powers at the<br/>moment was out of the question, she had to bide her time and wait.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Well, that was interesting," commented Carrot sourly as they went<br/>back to the dojo.<p>"How did she know we were in here? None of the other senshi<br/>noticed," said Dan irritably.<p>"I'm not sure," said Ranma. "I think it's because she knew us the<br/>best. Out of all the Senshi, I used to hang around her the most."<p>"Eew. I can't believe it, you're a..." said Carrot in disgust.<p>"That isn't very nice," agreed Pissant.<p>"Shut up!" cried Ranma as he punched them in the face. "It wasn't<br/>like that at all you jerks!"<p>"Calm down, Carrot was joking, and Pissant is an idiot," said Dan.<br/>"Still, they are right. This could be a problem, or it could work out.<br/>Too early to tell yet."<p>"Come on, let's go pick up the guys," said Carrot. "We need to<br/>start setting things up tonight."<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Not bad," said Jadeite as he looked around the empty office. He<br/>was pushing a large overloaded handcart into the room and shoved it<br/>aside as he strolled through the area. It was on the top floor of one<br/>of the smaller skyscrapers in Tokyo. There was nothing on the entire<br/>floor other than them. "So, this is the new place?"<p>"Right," said Ranma with a short nod as he walked in behind him<br/>with a cart of his own. "We need to start setting up."<p>"We'll get the teleporter running at least," agreed Nephrite as he<br/>pushed a cart full of equipment into the room. Kunzite and Zocite<br/>followed doing the same thing.<p>"Well, I've seen worse," commented Zocite with a small frown.<p>"We aren't royalty any more you know. We have to take care of<br/>things like this ourselves," said Kunzite as he frowned at the man in<br/>reply.<p>"I suppose you're right," said Zocite with a small nod.<p>+++++++++++<p>About an hour and a half later, the carts were unloaded. Most of<br/>the equipment was spread out along the floor now, and a few things<br/>were set up already. One of which was a circular pad on the floor in<br/>one of the back offices. It had a small machine hooked up to it on top<br/>of a short pedestal.<p>"So, this is the teleporter?" said Ranma as he glanced at it for a<br/>moment. "I remember it being...bigger..."<p>"The ones used on starships are a bit more yes," confirmed<br/>Jadeite. "This one is for short range use. Why do you think we weren't<br/>using it to transport ourselves here?"<p>"Okay, so? What's the range?" said Ranma as he turned to look at<br/>the man for a moment.<p>"It'll take you anywhere in Japan, but that's about it," replied<br/>Jadeite with a small shrug.<p>Ranma was about to respond when Nephrite burst into the room.<br/>"We've got something on the scanners."<p>Jadeite and Ranma rushed out of the room and looked at the<br/>holographic display from the back of one of the mercury computers. It<br/>was a map of the city, and a flashing red dot was easily visible in<br/>one of the streets.<p>"Youma?" asked Ranma carefully.<p>"Yup," said Nephrite as he began to work at the keys for a moment.<p>"Should we go?" asked Zocite with a smirk on his face.<p>"Of course," said Kunzite as he smiled darkly. "We can't let those<br/>senshi get there before us."<p>Ranma put on his shades and started towards the transporter room.<br/>"Let's go then." He paused in front of it and pulled the glasses off<br/>of his face. "I always wondered how no one ever recognized those<br/>Senshi," he commented as he pushed a small button on the inside of the<br/>frames.<p>"What? Did you think it was magic?" asked Zocite with a small<br/>snort of amusement.<p>"I suppose not," commented the boy as he stepped onto the pad.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Um, now what?" said Usagi as she hid behind a dumpster with Rei<br/>and Makoto.<p>"We've got to get rid of that thing!" muttered Makoto angrily as<br/>she peered around the corner for a moment.<p>The thing was currently holding a car over its head and tearing it<br/>in half with its claws. It was an insect like creature, looking rather<br/>like a gigantic humanoid cricket.<p>"I hate bugs," muttered Rei angrily.<p>"Where are the others?" said Usagi fearfully.<p>"Over there, we need to come up with a plan," said Makoto.<p>++++++++++<p>"Great," grumbled Tsuki irritably as she watched the thing<br/>demolish a car. "Now what?"<p>"You're the one who's supposed to know all this stuff!" snapped<br/>Minako.<p>"Hey! I was just a temporary stand in!" retorted the girl as she<br/>grabbed her face and pulled on her cheeks.<p>"Calm down! We need to think of a way to get rid of that thing!"<br/>said Ami firmly.<p>"Why don't we just go out there and pound it?" said Tsuki as she<br/>made a punching motion with her arm.<p>"Are you nuts? That thing is tearing cars in half out there!"<br/>snapped Minako. "'Tis better to fight and stay, to live to fight<br/>another day!"<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" said Tsuki as she put the<br/>girl in a headlock. "Can't you say anything that makes sense damn<br/>it!"<p>"Stop it right now!" snapped Ami. "We have to work together, I'm<br/>going to call the others!"<p>"Yeah, you do that...who the hell are those guys?" said Tsuki as<br/>she dropped Minako and focused her attention on the street.<p>Ami and Minako both blinked and looked out into the street. Five<br/>men in black suits were standing in front of the monster calmly. "What<br/>the?"<p>+++++++++++<p>"I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to step away from the<br/>vehicle, sir." Ranma was looking up at the thing as it lifted a car<br/>over its head and began to rip it in half.<p>It paused and looked at him for a moment, turning its head<br/>slightly in confusion.<p>"What the hell is it doing?" muttered Nephrite as he glanced down<br/>the street and saw the rows of broken cars.<p>The bug creature ignored them and went back to its task. It lifted<br/>the car over its head completely, and began to drink the gasoline from<br/>the remains of the tank.<p>Ranma frowned and reached into his coat, pulling out a sleek<br/>looking silver handgun. Without a single word, he blasted the car from<br/>its grip with a single shot. The car was nothing more than a ball of<br/>twisted metal and flame when it came back down to the ground again.<p>The creature roared angrily at him and stared the five of them<br/>down for a moment.<p>"Sir, I'm afraid that you're over the legal limit. You're gonna<br/>have to come with us now," said the boy firmly.<p>The creature charged forward, causing all five of the men to move<br/>back defensively. Without a single word Ranma simply leveled his<br/>weapon and waited.<p>"What the hell are you doing?" said Nephrite in shock.<p>"Waiting until it open's its big mouth," replied Ranma coldly.<p>The creature lowered its head and roared. The boy fired a single<br/>shot into its jaws as it did so.<p>A massive ball of flames rose into the air as the thing exploded.<br/>Fire rained out of the sky for almost two blocks as the burning gas<br/>fell to the ground.<p>Ranma merely stood calmly and dusted off his lapel for a moment,<br/>cleaning off a tiny bit of the remains that had landed there. He was<br/>relatively clean for the most part though. "That was easy enough."<p>"Who the hell are you?" cried a feminine voice from behind them.<p>Ranma raised his eyebrow and turned slowly around to see the six<br/>girls standing behind him in a row. The generals moved up beside him,<br/>all of them ready for a fight. "Hello ladies."<p>Usagi stepped back in horror. "You!"<p>Ranma chuckled and took off his glasses. "I see we meet again, how<br/>have you been."<p>"You bastard!" screamed Tsuki angrily from behind the blonde.<br/>"I'll see you destroyed for what you did!"<p>"Well, I certainly remember that one," said Jadeite with a small<br/>frown as he glared at the violet haired senshi.<p>"Indeed," agreed Nephrite coolly.<p>Recognition began to hit the other senshi as they realized who the<br/>pair was.<p>"Hey, it's..." muttered Minako.<p>"Those guys!" growled Makoto as she stepped back.<p>"You five can't even handle me alone. What on earth makes you<br/>think you could fight the five of us?" said Ranma coldly.<p>"Because they believe in themselves!" said a new voice from<br/>overhead. "You can do it Sailor Moon!"<p>Ranma frowned and blasted the rose in mid air before it stuck in<br/>the ground. "Will you shut up?"<p>Tuxedo Mask growled and landed in front of the girls. "Villain!<br/>I'll..."<p>"You'll what?" said Ranma as he pointed his weapon at the man.<p>Tuxedo Mask froze.<p>"It seems he's got a little memory about what that is," said<br/>Nephrite with a small chuckle.<p>Ranma snorted and fired a shot into Mercury's chest. She screamed<br/>in shock and fell flat on her back. "Relax, these weapons can't hurt<br/>the senshi. Why do you think we never used them before now?" He put it<br/>back in its holster inside his jacket.<p>Mercury got up, looking a little shaken, but unharmed.<p>"Monster!" snarled Venus as she helped her friend stand.<p>"You still want to fight?" said Ranma as he narrowed his eyes at<br/>the girls.<p>"As a warrior of justice, I Sailor Moon, cannot allow this to<br/>continue! We shall defeat you!" said Usagi as she steeled herself and<br/>her companions.<p>"Shit," grumbled Nephrite.<p>"Relax, I've taken them on single handedly before," said Ranma<br/>with a small chuckle as his aura began to glow. "The five of us should<br/>have no trouble at all."<p>"Endimyon," said Zocite as he stared at Tuxedo Mask for a moment.<br/>"You still owe me five hundred credits!"<p>"I what?" said the man dumbly in reply.<p>"Let's just get this over with," grumbled Jadeite irritably.<p>"You said it," agreed Kunzite.<p>+++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Sorry, mostly set up stuff this time. Next time, jokes return full<br/>force. Hikaru deals with the Mask, Ranma and his friends deal with the<br/>Senshi, Akane deals with her Sister, and Ryoga...is still lost.<p>
