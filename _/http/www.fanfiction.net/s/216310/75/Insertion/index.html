</div>Insertion<p>Part 75<p>Another Chinese Adventure!<p>+++++++++++++<p>Carrot smirked as he stood on the shores of<br/>China. They had landed in the wilderness and the<br/>group stood in the sand, looking into the thick<br/>forest that ran along the edge of the beach.<p>"Wow," muttered Usagi as she stared at the tree<br/>line, it stretched as far as the eye could see in<br/>either direction.<p>"It's just the beginning. It's been a long<br/>time," commented Yohiko calmly as she stared at<br/>the shores.<p>"Kinda weird looking at it again isn't it?"<br/>said Carrot as he smirked at her.<p>"Yes," said the woman as she glanced at Usagi<br/>for a moment. "It's been a very long time."<p>"What do we do now?" asked Ryoga as he frowned<br/>at the pair.<p>"Ask our guide," replied Carrot as he turned<br/>to look at Plum.<p>Ukyo stepped forward. "I've got my own reason<br/>for being here." She started to walk away, but<br/>Carrot grabbed her shoulder.<p>"Not so fast, you have no idea where you're<br/>going," he said calmly.<p>Plum blinked at this and stared at the<br/>brunette for a moment. "What is talking?"<p>"Where are we going? What's our route?" said<br/>Carrot as he pulled his hand off of the frowning<br/>Ukyo.<p>"We go this way," said Plum as she pulled out<br/>a map and pointed out their route. It was drawn<br/>onto the map with a highlighter.<p>"Why does it go around this area?" asked<br/>Carrot as he smirked at her.<p>"We are going to Mount Phoenix," said the<br/>girl. "Lots of dangerous people in area."<p>"You mean the Musk," said Carrot with a small<br/>chuckle.<p>"Yes, this where Musk tribe live. Not many<br/>left, but still better to avoid them," said Plum<br/>with a small nod.<p>"We'll be fine," said Carrot. "We'll shave a<br/>day off our trip by going through there."<p>"More like add a day," said Yohiko irritably.<p>"Well, that depends on how our old friend<br/>feels about us. Either way, we should be able to<br/>gain safe passage at least," responded Carrot.<br/>"Especially after he hears that most of us are<br/>just passing through."<p>"Ukyo isn't, she might compromise the rest of<br/>us," pointed out Yohiko.<p>"Aw, don't be such a spoilsport," snorted<br/>Carrot cheerfully.<p>"What are you talking about?" asked Ryoga in<br/>confusion.<p>"Yeah?" agreed Usagi.<p>"We're going to pass through Amazon held land,<br/>and Musk held land to get where we're going. I'm<br/>friendly with the Amazons," said Carrot with a<br/>small sigh. "That shouldn't cause too much<br/>trouble. Plus, Ranma is the Princess of the Musk<br/>now or something, so that should get us through<br/>there. Ukyo can take care of what she needs after<br/>we've gone."<p>The girl flashed an angry looking frown at<br/>him.<p>"You've waited this long, waiting until we've<br/>passed through to do whatever you need won't hurt<br/>you," said Yohiko firmly.<p>The girl nodded and turned her head away. "I<br/>guess it will be the fastest way to find the<br/>place."<p>"Right, you're catching on," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Why don't we just fly there?" asked Usagi.<p>"Sure, if you want to carry Ryoga across<br/>China, go right ahead," said Carrot as he smirked<br/>at the girl. "Plum can't fly either. I'm sure<br/>she'll need a lift, plus that leaves another one<br/>of us to carry Ukyo, meaning we'll all have<br/>passengers."<p>Usagi looked at her cousin and frowned. "I get<br/>the point."<p>"Hey! I am not fat!" snapped Ryoga irritably.<p>"No, but you're heavy," responded Yohiko. "I'm<br/>not lugging you around, and I don't trust you with<br/>my daughter."<p>"We didn't know!" cried the boy defensively.<p>"Let's not start that again, you're going to<br/>make me angry just talking about it," snorted<br/>Carrot.<p>"Can we go now?" muttered Plum.<p>"Yeah, good idea," agreed Yohiko.<p>Carrot sighed and pulled on Ryoga's collar to<br/>keep the boy moving in the right direction.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Two days later...<p>"Where are we?" grumbled Ryoga as he glared at<br/>the rope tied around his wrist. Plum was tugging<br/>him along with a sort of lazy expression on her<br/>face.<p>"We could have been there by now," whined<br/>Usagi.<p>"Relax and take in some of the culture,"<br/>replied Carrot as he slapped at his neck.<p>"Well the culture is covering me with bug<br/>bites!" snapped Usagi as she did the same thing.<p>"Quit whining," grumbled Yohiko as she looked<br/>up at the mountains that surrounded them on either<br/>side.<p>"Where are we anyway?" repeated Ryoga.<p>"About a mile into Musk held territory," said<br/>Carrot. "Well, the map is kinda old, and the<br/>Amazon's thought they'd died out, so I doubt if<br/>they hold much of the land anymore."<p>"Yeah, we'll probably miss them, but they<br/>should be somewhere in this area."<p>"After we pass through here, then we go about<br/>a hundred miles to get into the mountains where<br/>the amazons live. We got a while to walk yet."<p>"This would have taken weeks, thank goodness<br/>for modern transportation," said Yohiko with a<br/>small sigh.<p>"Yeah, I miss the train," commented Usagi.<p>"Well there aren't any trains that come here,"<br/>snorted Carrot. "It's called a 'remote region' for<br/>a reason you know."<p>"Yeah, yeah," grumbled Usagi.<p>Ukyo had been silent for most of the trip and<br/>hung back away from the rest of the crowd. She<br/>snorted at the bickering and glanced around at her<br/>surroundings. "So, Ranma should be near here<br/>somewhere?"<p>"We aren't sure of that, we got about a<br/>hundred mile diameter area that might be possible.<br/>Don't go wandering off just yet. We may run into<br/>them, if not, you can always backtrack. It'll be a<br/>good way for you to get familiar with the terrain<br/>anyway," said Carrot calmly.<p>The girl snorted again, but complied anyway.<br/>"Why should I trust you?"<p>"Why shouldn't you?" replied Yohiko as she<br/>smirked at her.<p>Ukyo grumbled and looked away from her<br/>purposefully.<p>"Stupid trees!" growled Usagi.<p>"You'll look back on this and be glad it<br/>happened," commented Carrot.<p>The bushes all around them suddenly shifted<br/>and the group looked at the large group of armed<br/>men that now surrounded them.<p>"Hiya!" said Carrot cheerfully.<p>++++++++++++<p>Usagi growled as she swung back and fourth,<br/>she had been bound by her ankles and wrists and<br/>was being carried on a pole between two of the<br/>men. "Yeah, I'm sure I'll treasure this memory."<p>"It builds character," commented Carrot from<br/>his own pole just behind her.<p>The whole group had been captured. Ryoga was<br/>rather angry about allowing themselves to be taken<br/>that way, but he accepted it. It wasn't a<br/>situation he couldn't escape from. Especially with<br/>Usagi and her parents there.<p>Ukyo had also put up no resistance, without<br/>being prompted by the two adults.<p>"We're never going to get there at this rate,"<br/>grumbled Plum from her position at the back of the<br/>line. She was being pulled along by her wrists as<br/>her arms and legs were too small to really string<br/>her up like the others had been.<p>"Relax, I've got it all under control," said<br/>Carrot cheerfully.<p>"Right, try not to piss them off, the already<br/>don't like you," said Yohiko irritably.<p>"Well, they don't exactly like you either,"<br/>said Carrot with a small shrug.<p>"Quiet down!" snapped one of the larger men<br/>carrying him. He had fangs and stripes on his face<br/>like a tiger. He also had a tail, and his ears<br/>were like those of the animal that was in his<br/>blood.<p>"Heh, you look strong, this should be a good<br/>fight," said Carrot as he glared at the man for a<br/>moment.<p>The tiger man snorted at this and turned away.<br/>"Stupid trespassers."<p>"You should put up signs or something if you<br/>don't want people on your land," commented Yohiko.<p>"Are we sure?" asked one of the men carrying<br/>her.<p>"No, but Lord Herb can tell us," commented the<br/>one behind her.<p>"Still, it should be interesting if they are!"<br/>said the first one.<p>"Yeah, a tournament again!" said the one in<br/>back. "Real girls! We've got three that look like<br/>they might be! I'll win me a wife for sure!"<p>"Are you sure those things are titties?"<br/>commented the first one.<p>"I dunno," commented the other one. "Maybe we<br/>should look."<p>Yohiko snapped her head around and stared at<br/>him.<p>"What are you looking at prisoner?"<p>"Uh oh, so much for that plan," commented<br/>Carrot.<p>"No! You may not feel to see if they're real<br/>or not!" screamed Usagi.<p>"Aiya! I'm too young to have breasts! Stop<br/>that!"<p>"You Jackass! Of course I look like a boy! I'm<br/>supposed too!"<p>"Bloody hell," said Carrot with a final sigh.<br/>He strained for a second and snapped the bonds on<br/>his feet and hands. The two men carrying him<br/>blinked in surprise.<p>"What do you think you're doing?" snarled the<br/>Tiger man.<p>"Trying to keep your men from getting<br/>themselves killed," replied Carrot as he started<br/>walking towards the others.<p>"Pardon?" muttered the tiger man as he blinked<br/>and faltered out of his fighting stance for a<br/>moment.<p>By the time Carrot got close enough, it was<br/>already too late.<p>"DIEEE!" screamed Yohiko as her body suddenly<br/>exploded with power. Her wings shot out of her<br/>back and began to knock her captors away easily.<br/>"Usagi! Are you all right?"<p>The girl was sitting on the ground looking<br/>somewhat dazed as her mother hovered over her<br/>protectively. Black tendrils of her clothing were<br/>lashing out at the Musk as they tried to move in<br/>around her. They were growing more cautious<br/>though.<p>Ryoga rushed up from behind with Ukyo at his<br/>side, they both kept their distance. Carrot<br/>noticed Plum was hanging off the lost boy's neck<br/>in his arm.<p>There was a trail of men lying on the ground<br/>behind them.<p>"That's enough!" demanded Carrot as he stood<br/>firmly in the middle of the path.<p>Everyone turned to look at him and he sighed.<br/>"Damn, I'd forgotten about how perverted these<br/>idiots are." He glanced around at the fallen Musk,<br/>and the few others who were still circling the<br/>scene warily.<p>He paused when he heard growling behind him<br/>and turned to face the angry looking tiger man.<br/>"So, it was an ambush?"<p>"The hell it was! You idiot! You can't just go<br/>around grabbing girls' breasts! They get all<br/>pissed off when you do!" snapped Carrot.<p>The man faltered and stared at him. "What?"<p>"Well look at them! You're lucky no one is<br/>dead!" said Carrot as he looked at the man for a<br/>moment. "Calm down all of you!"<p>The group of angry women, and one little girl<br/>all glared at him.<p>"Yohiko, I'm betting at least you and Plum had<br/>some idea about this. Come on, give them a break<br/>will ya?" he said with a small sigh. "We'll go<br/>talk to Ranma first before we send them to<br/>extinction."<p>The tiger man bared his fangs and moved to<br/>grab Carrot in anger.<p>The man casually sidestepped and grabbed his<br/>neck, lifting him off the ground and dangling him<br/>there for a moment. The man's claws quickly<br/>bloodied his arm, but a protective wrapping moved<br/>up from his clothes and prevented any further<br/>damage. "Calm down. We're old friends of Herb's<br/>bride. We need to talk with him."<p>The beast man glared at him, but calmed<br/>considerably. "You are the ones we were told<br/>about! I'll never allow you near the Queen!"<p>"Queen?" said Carrot as he arched his eyebrow<br/>slightly. "Well, she's one of them. The rest of us<br/>aren't. That's his old teacher, and I'm a relative<br/>of his. Can't you see the resemblance."<p>"Relative? You've come to kidnap the queen?"<br/>cried the man in alarm as his struggles increased<br/>again.<p>"Stop that!" snapped Carrot as he shook the<br/>man violently. "I'm not his father. Relax would<br/>you, the girl he was engaged to is married now,<br/>there's no danger of a kidnapping." He turned his<br/>head and frowned at Ukyo for a moment. "You, come<br/>here."<p>The girl reluctantly did so, stopping long<br/>enough to kick one of the downed men in the<br/>stomach. The remaining warriors started to emerge<br/>from the bushes with their weapons drawn.<p>Carrot sighed. "I know you want revenge, but<br/>you're going to behave yourself until we're gone<br/>at least. After that, you do what you want."<p>"Why are we going to see Ranma?" snorted<br/>Yohiko.<p>"We may get ourselves an ally out of this,"<br/>said Carrot calmly. "Ranma might help us."<p>"We attacked him the last time we saw him,"<br/>pointed out Yohiko.<p>"We also introduced him to his husband, or<br/>wife...whatever the hell Herb is to him,"<br/>responded Carrot. "I think he might appreciate<br/>that."<p>"He might not be happy about it," replied<br/>Yohiko.<p>"What's all this about Ranma?" said Ryoga with<br/>a small frown on his face.<p>"Don't you start. Ranma Saotome is off<br/>limits," said Carrot calmly as he leveled a small<br/>glare at the man. He dropped the tiger man on the<br/>ground and snorted. "We come in peace, we need to<br/>talk to your leader. There's trouble on Mount<br/>Pheonix."<p>The beast man's eyes went wide and he glared<br/>at his former captor. "Lies!"<p>"I don't care about Ranma Saotome, or his<br/>relationship with anyone from Japan. I'm also<br/>pretty aware of what Saffron and his friends will<br/>do if the Pheonix God is allowed to rise again."<p>"The Pheonix God?" said the tiger man in<br/>shock. "What do you know of this?"<p>"That young girl, is from Jusenkyo. She is the<br/>daughter of the guide there. People from Mount<br/>Pheonix chased her to us, and we were attacked. We<br/>learned that the people there are seeking<br/>Jusendo."<p>"That means..." said the tiger man with an<br/>angry growl.<p>"Yes, the rise of the Pheonix God is near. You<br/>know, I've heard old legends about a battle<br/>between a Dragon and a Pheonix. I wonder, do the<br/>Musk have anything to do with that legend?"<p>The tiger man stared up at him and a cold<br/>smile formed on his lips. "You're perceptive for<br/>an outsider."<p>"It's what I do," replied Carrot with a small<br/>chuckle. "Whatever concerns we might have with<br/>Ranma Saotome, they can wait until this is over."<p>The beast man nodded and signaled the large group<br/>of warriors with his clawed hand. "We will take<br/>you to Lord Herb. Perhaps he should hear of this."<p>Carrot nodded and motioned for the others to<br/>follow him. Ukyo walked up to his side and glared<br/>at him angrily. "What's going on here?"<p>"This is much deeper than your revenge Kuonji,<br/>and much more important. Something terrible is<br/>about to be unleashed on the world, and we're the<br/>only ones who know about it."<p>"So tell someone else!" she snapped.<p>"Tell them what? That a demigod is about to be<br/>reborn in a remote region of China, and they<br/>should send an army to stop it? I'd like to have<br/>some credibility in the future."<p>"What the hell are you talking about? What<br/>demigod?"<p>"Lord Saffron. The ancient enemy of our<br/>people," replied the tiger man as he moved in step<br/>with Ranma. "This is not to be taken lightly. The<br/>last time the Pheonix God came, he enslaved most<br/>of the world. Saffron is over a thousand years<br/>old, but lives in the body of a child. When the<br/>time comes, he'll use the magic of Jusendo to<br/>transform, and become his true self again."<p>"I've never heard of this," snorted Ukyo.<p>"Yes, luckily, we were able to stop him. His<br/>rule lasted only a few months. The Great Musk<br/>King, Cumin, defeated him, but at a high cost."<p>"High cost?" muttered the girl in confusion.<p>"Surely you've heard the legend of the Dragon<br/>and the Pheonix Kuonji," said Yohiko as she moved<br/>up beside the trio. "The Dragon defeated the<br/>Pheonix, but it was reborn in flames."<p>"Yes, and his rebirth, destroyed Cumin,<br/>leaving his young son Herb to rule in his stead."<p>"Hmmm, Herb is older than I had thought,"<br/>commented Carrot. "I'd heard of Saffron before,<br/>but I had no idea he was a problem of<br/>this...magnitude."<p>"Because of his blood, Lord Herb matured very<br/>slowly. He has just become an adult within the<br/>last few years," said the tiger man with a slight<br/>snort. "He is very powerful now."<p>"But is he powerful enough?" commented Carrot<br/>carefully.<p>"He'd better be," snorted the beast man with a<br/>slight growl of irritation.<p>"I wasn't implying that he was weak, calm<br/>down. We don't know how powerful Saffron is, nor<br/>do we know how strong Herb is in relation to him."<br/>Carrot had some idea, but he was pretty sure Herb<br/>wouldn't last long.<p>"Anyone who would know of this battle, is long<br/>since dead," replied the beast man with a small<br/>sigh.<p>"I would think so," said Carrot. "I've noticed<br/>you're not as human looking as the Musk I've seen<br/>before."<p>"Yes." It was a statement with no malice in<br/>it.<p>"Are most Musk like you? I've seen Herb, and<br/>Lime and Mint."<p>"We vary. It depends how long our bloodlines<br/>go back," commented the beast man. "Most of our<br/>wives came from Jusenkyo until the fall about a<br/>hundred years ago. However, we did take women from<br/>neighboring villages on occasion."<p>"The closer your family is related to<br/>Jusenkyo, the more you look like the beasts in<br/>your line," said Carrot with an understanding nod.<p>"Yes, only the more human looking members of<br/>our tribe ever leave the village."<p>"That would make sense, although I imagine the<br/>few exceptions gave rise to the legends about<br/>lycanthropies that seem to run about most of the<br/>world."<p>"Yes," said the beast man with a slight chuckle.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Captain Toras, what brings you back from<br/>patrol so early?" said Herb as he stood up from<br/>his throne within the small palace. It was nestled<br/>within a tiny village well hidden in a small<br/>valley between several large mountains.<p>The tiger man bowed deeply and growled. "I<br/>bring distressing news."<p>"Yes?" said Herb seriously as he motioned for<br/>the man to rise.<p>"Reports, from outsiders we met on our patrol.<br/>They speak of Mount Pheonix," said Toras with a<br/>firm conviction in his voice.<p>"Outsiders?" said Herb with a small frown.<br/>"Should we trust them?"<p>"They knew too much for it to be false," responded<br/>Toras. "A little too much if you ask me. They also<br/>claimed to know both you and the Queen."<p>"I thought I told you about callin me that!"<br/>snapped Ranma as he entered the room. He was<br/>dressed in rich silk clothing with an armored<br/>breastplate over his chest.<p>"Well, I am the King," said Herb with a small<br/>sigh. "You are my mate, that makes you..."<p>"Don't you dare say it!" snapped Ranma<br/>irritably.<p>"Fine," said Herb with a small sigh.<p>"Well, well, look what the cat dragged in,"<br/>said a quiet voice from the shadows. A man walked<br/>out and smirked at the pair on the throne with a<br/>staff in his hands. He bowed to them and chuckled.<p>Toras bolted upright and growled at the man.<br/>"Who are you? How dare you..."<p>"I am Xellos, I've come to soften the way a<br/>bit for dear Ranma's friends," responded the<br/>mazoku calmly. "I'll be out of your hair in a<br/>moment, don't worry."<p>"Who are you?" snarled Herb as a glow started<br/>to form around his body.<p>"Someone who far exceeds any dragon in power,"<br/>replied Xellos with a dangerous tone to his voice.<br/>"I suggest you pay attention for a moment. What I<br/>have to tell you is important."<p>"Who the heck are you?" growled Ranma.<p>"No human exceeds a dragon in power! Fool!<br/>I'll destroy you!" growled Herb as he started to<br/>step forward.<p>Xellos's eyes glowed with a purple energy as<br/>he stared the man down calmly. "Whoever said I was<br/>human? In any case, you've got some old friends<br/>visiting Ranma."<p>"Wha?" said the pigtailed boy as he stepped<br/>back.<p>"Some of your friends from Nerima have come to<br/>China," said the man as he turned his back on the<br/>pair and paced a bit in front of them.<p>"No! Guards! Make em go away!" cried the<br/>pigtailed boy as he jumped behind his throne and<br/>peered around it.<p>"At once!" said Toras as he turned to leave.<p>"I wouldn't recommend that," warned Xellos.<br/>"You're going to need their help in order to<br/>defeat Saffron."<p>"What?" said Herb as his face went pale.<p>"The Lord of Mount Pheonix is rising again<br/>Herb," said the priest calmly as he turned to look<br/>at him. "You're not powerful enough to face him<br/>yet. In dragons' terms, you're still a fledgling.<br/>You haven't even had your first molting yet."<p>The man staggered back and slumped down onto<br/>his throne. "It can't be!"<p>"Saffron will destroy you as you are now, but<br/>you already know that. You remember just how<br/>strong your father was."<p>"What's he talkin about?" asked Ranma as he<br/>peered at his husband in confusion.<p>"Just the end of the world as we know it, if<br/>you fail to kill Saffron that is. However, you're<br/>about to get all the help you'll need. If you're<br/>smart enough to listen."<p>"Xellos! That had better not be you!" said<br/>Carrot as he shoved the doors to the throne room<br/>open and walked in with a scowl on his face.<p>"Oh! Fancy meeting you here!" said the priest<br/>cheerfully.<p>"What the hell is he doing here?" snapped<br/>Yohiko.<p>"Hi Uncle Xellos!" said Usagi cheerfully.<p>"Hello," said Ryoga nervously.<p>"Hey, it that guy again," muttered Plum.<p>"You're..." said Ukyo with a small frown.<p>"AAAAAHHHHH! They've come for me! Don't let em<br/>get me!" cried Ranma as he dove for cover. "I<br/>didn't mean to do it! Please don't..." He blinked<br/>when he peered out from behind his throne and saw<br/>only once fiancee standing there. "Huh? Ucchan?"<p>"Don't you dare call me that!" cried the girl<br/>as she pulled her spatula from behind her back.<p>"Ukyo!" snapped Carrot as he whirled around to<br/>face her. Xellos started creeping off while his<br/>back was turned.<p>"No you don't," said Yohiko as she snagged his<br/>collar.<p>"I was being helpful! Honest!" said the priest<br/>somewhat pathetically.<p>"That woman!" gasped Herb dumbly.<p>"Hello again," she said with a smirk on her<br/>face. "I can see you two have grown quite<br/>comfortable."<p>"You've come to take my mate away have you?"<br/>snarled Herb as his power flared out suddenly.<p>"Actually, we're here about Saffron," replied<br/>Carrot with a small shrug.<p>"I know you...two of you?" gasped Herb in<br/>horror. His head darted between Yohiko and Carrot<br/>for a moment.<p>"Relax, we aren't here about Ranma. Well, most<br/>of us aren't. Just Ukyo here, all she wants is<br/>revenge, she sort of tagged along for the ride<br/>though."<p>"What?" said Ranma in confusion.<p>"I'll get you yet!" snapped Ukyo hatefully.<p>"Over my dead body!" snarled Herb.<p>"Hey! I don't need your help damn it!" snapped<br/>Ranma as he shoved his husband aside.<br/>"Ucchan...I..."<p>"That's enough! You two can work this out on<br/>your own later, I don't particularly care,"<br/>announced Carrot firmly. "We've got bigger<br/>problems."<p>"What the heck are you talking about?" snapped<br/>Ranma.<p>"Saffron," responded Herb with a sudden calm<br/>coming over him.<p>"That's right," said Carrot with a smirk on<br/>his face. "The Demigod has been reborn. I'm<br/>wondering just how much help you can be."<p>"You're going to fight Saffron?" snorted Herb<br/>in disgust. "You won't last a minute against that<br/>monster."<p>"Just like I wouldn't last a minute against<br/>you, right?" replied Yohiko with a smirk of her<br/>own.<p>Herb turned his head away from her. "Saffron<br/>is far beyond my power. I'm not strong enough to<br/>face him. It's too soon."<p>"Then you're going to need our help," replied<br/>Carrot.<p>Herb frowned at them. "It seems you have me."<p>"What the hell is going on here?" cried Ranma<br/>as he looked around the room in confusion.<p>"We aren't here for you Ranma. There's<br/>something more important right now," replied Ukyo<br/>as she leveled a glare of hatred on the boy.<p>Carrot and Yohiko turned to look at her in<br/>surprise.<p>"When it's over, you and I are going<br/>to...discuss this," she said coldly.<p>"Ucchan...I..." stammered the boy with a hurt<br/>look on his face.<p>"Later Saotome," said Carrot before he could<br/>speak. "The fate of the world is in our hands.<br/>Your personal problems can wait."<p>"How dare you speak to my queen that way?"<br/>snapped Herb.<p>Ranma hit him over the head with his own<br/>throne. "I told you about callin me that!"<p>"Ouch," commented Usagi. "Wait...those two are<br/>married?" She got a slightly sick look on her<br/>face. "No way! They're both such cute guys!"<p>"Ranma...you really..."<p>"What of it porky?" snorted the pigtailed boy<br/>as he crossed his arms and blushed.<p>"You mean to tell me, that you left<br/>Akane...for a man?" said Ryoga in disbelief.<p>"It ain't like that!" snapped Ranma angrily as<br/>he moved into a combat stance, ready for Ryoga to<br/>start crying out for vengeance.<p>"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!"<p>"What the hell are you laughing at?" snapped<br/>the pigtailed boy.<p>"Ranma! Married a man! Ha! I don't believe it!<br/>Mr. Manly! HA! HA! Macho jerk! Married a man!<br/>BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!"<p>Herb recovered and sent a huge ball of chi<br/>into the boy, silencing his laughter.<p>Ryoga stood up and blinked. "That hurt!"<p>"Enough! We've got enough problems as it is!<br/>You can be civil until later," said Yohiko as she<br/>stepped between them.<p>"Bad move lady," said Carrot just before Herb<br/>blasted her as well. "Are you through yet?"<p>"But, they're so cute!" said Usagi with tears<br/>of confusion in her eyes.<p>"I'll explain it later dear," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Okay..." muttered the girl in confusion.<p>"Well, I've said what I needed to," said<br/>Xellos as he vanished into the shadows.<p>"Where the hell do you think you're going?"<br/>snapped Yohiko as she stood up and jumped after<br/>him. He was gone when she landed and she snapped<br/>her fingers. "Damn it."<p>"Who was that?" said Ranma as he frowned at<br/>where he had been.<p>"Xellos is..a sorcerer. He's helpful<br/>sometimes, but he has a nasty tendency to withhold<br/>information. You shouldn't trust him, not<br/>completely," replied Carrot.<p>"Oh," said Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"So, what should we do Lord Herb?" asked<br/>Toras.<p>"What was your plan?" asked the King as he<br/>looked at Carrot.<p>"We were on our way to Mount Pheonix, we need<br/>to get the map of Jusendo back from them."<p>"The map will be useless. They already know<br/>where Jusendo is by now," said Herb calmly.<p>"We don't, do you?" asked Carrot.<p>"Lost, to the winds of time," said Herb as he<br/>shook his head.<p>"So we do need the map. They'll be difficult<br/>to follow. They can fly, it would be too easy to<br/>spot us or distract us if we tried to just follow<br/>them. Plus, for all we know, they're already<br/>there."<p>"I understand, the map is needed to simply get<br/>there," said Herb.<p>"I can get us there, but we need map anyway,"<br/>said Plum. "There is a map to Jusendo on the wall<br/>of my home. I'll bet Pheonix people knew location<br/>already, they needed map to enter mountain<br/>safely."<p>Everyone but Carrot turned to look at her.<p>"I thought you could," responded the man as he<br/>smirked at her. "Still, I took a look at that map.<br/>We need it to get into Jusendo. Only one entrance<br/>is the real one, the rest are traps."<p>"He's right," said Plum.<p>"So what can we do?" asked Ranma.<p>"Offer any help we can, if we can stop<br/>Saffron's rebirth, we must do so," said Herb.<p>"The Amazons might be helpful," said Carrot.<p>"We'll send for a representative," said Herb.<p>"We don't have time," pointed out Carrot.<br/>"We're going that way anyway."<p>"I shall accompany you," said Toras.<p>"No, you'll stay here. I'll go," said Herb.<p>"Lord Herb!" cried Toras in shock.<p>"I'm going too," said Ranma firmly.<p>"No, you'll stay here. If something happens to<br/>me, my people need a leader. They will need you<br/>especially if I do not return."<p>"What?" gasped Ranma in shock.<p>"He's right Ranma. If we fail, Saffron will<br/>come here, and he'll die anyway. Saffron may<br/>ignore you and your people if Herb is with us.<br/>You're no threat to him without Herb."<p>"But...no way! I ain't..."<p>"You are a ruler of the Musk! You have<br/>responsibilities now!" snapped Herb angrily.<p>The pigtailed boy frowned and stared at the<br/>man for a moment. "I..."<p>"Your people are more important Ranma," said<br/>Carrot calmly.<p>The pigtailed boy clenched his fist and<br/>frowned at Herb. "You'd better come back."<p>"If I do not come back in a week, take the<br/>tribe and move into the jungles to the south,"<br/>replied Herb calmly. "We'll just have to wait<br/>until Saffron's rule is over, and live quietly<br/>until he dies. Do not attack him if we fail, or<br/>all the Musk will perish."<p>"What?" cried Ranma in shock.<p>"He's right Saotome, but we won't fail," said<br/>Carrot with a small chuckle. "You of all people<br/>should know, that we don't fail."<p>The boy looked at him for a moment. Finally he<br/>nodded his head. "If it was anyone but you..."<p>"Don't worry, I'll try to bring him back in<br/>one piece," said Carrot cheerfully.<p>"So, we should get going?" said Ryoga.<p>"No, you'll stay here tonight. It's dark, not<br/>even my people will roam these woods at night,"<br/>said Herb with a small frown.<p>"Something out there?" asked Carrot.<p>"Not in so many words," said Herb with a small<br/>chuckle. "There are those with too much of<br/>Jusenkyo in them. They no longer live amongst the<br/>Musk."<p>"In these woods?" asked Usagi nervously.<p>"No, far to the south. They avoid us for the<br/>most part, still, occasionally one of them will<br/>wander nearby," replied Herb calmly. "Beasts know<br/>when they are outclassed. Still, they are strong,<br/>and dangerous."<p>"I see," said Carrot as he nodded. "We need<br/>rest anyway. We wouldn't make the Amazon village<br/>until the middle of the night anyway. I don't feel<br/>like trying to get past their patrols and into the<br/>village. They are likely to think we're some sort<br/>of criminals. It would take much more time to<br/>explain things to them."<p>"He's right," agreed Yohiko. "It's best to<br/>approach them in daylight."<p>"So, you will stay here for the night," said<br/>Herb with a small sigh. "I shall have rooms<br/>prepared for you."<p>"Herb, you know what I can do. These women are<br/>under my protection, make sure it's clear," said<br/>Carrot firmly.<p>The Musk King nodded slowly and flashed a<br/>glance at Toras.<p>"I shall get them cloaks," he said with a<br/>slight bow of his head. "Please follow me."<p>"Wear what he gives you, most of the people<br/>here have never seen a woman before," said Yohiko<br/>to the girls. "That goes for you too Kuonji, it's<br/>best not to take chances."<p>The girl growled, but nodded.<p>The group followed the tiger man out of the<br/>throne room and walked through the halls. Carrot<br/>moved up to his side and casually started a<br/>conversation.<p>"You seem remarkably calm," said Carrot as he<br/>smirked at Toras.<p>"I have a wife," he replied with a small<br/>shrug.<p>"Oh?"<p>"Yes, there are more women here than most<br/>people know about. We tend to be secretive about<br/>women when we do get them," said Toras with a<br/>small chuckle.<p>"I thought I'd seen a few heavy cloaks in the<br/>village," commented Carrot.<p>"Really? I didn't think you'd see more than<br/>one. We have to be very protective of women here,<br/>for obvious reasons."<p>"Well, I suggest you keep your mouth shut<br/>about these girls. I defeated both Ranma and Herb<br/>alone when they were in Japan," said the man<br/>calmly.<p>"What?" said Toras.<p>"You heard me, if one of them goes missing, I<br/>will be quite angry," said Carrot with a slightly<br/>amused chuckle. "Otherwise, we'll get along fine."<p>"You shouldn't be so greedy," commented Toras<br/>in amusement.<p>"These women don't belong to me Toras, they're<br/>free to do as they choose. None of them would<br/>choose to remain here, I know them well enough to<br/>know better," said Carrot calmly. "Besides, two of<br/>them would kill anyone who tried to abduct them<br/>quite easily, and at least one more would give you<br/>a nasty thrashing at least. They are powerful<br/>warriors."<p>"I'd noticed. Which two should I be wary of?"<p>"Now that...is a secret," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Hmmm, you're a wise man for one so young,"<br/>said Toras with another chuckle.<p>"I'm not as young as I look," replied Carrot.<br/>"Besides, these women would mostly make poor<br/>wives. They are remarkably destructive, especially<br/>if they are unwilling wives, and they would be."<p>"Yes, most women are," commented Toras. "They<br/>do grow to accept us over time. Most of the time<br/>anyway."<p>"Where are Lime and Mint anyway? I haven't<br/>seen them around," commented Carrot.<p>"In their homes. They are relatively weak<br/>fighters. They look remarkably human, so they<br/>accompany royalty when on missions outside of the<br/>village. They also work as spies for the area<br/>around us."<p>"Sort of representatives of the Musk to the<br/>rest of the world?" commented Carrot.<p>"Yes, they have worked past their weak<br/>bloodlines remarkably well. They are very skilled<br/>for mostly human warriors," agreed Toras. "I am<br/>proud to have them in my guard. They are the<br/>youngest ever to receive as many honors as they<br/>have."<p>"Yes, they seem to work well together. Gave me<br/>a little trouble as well," agreed Carrot.<p>Toras stopped at a closet in the hallway and<br/>removed several dark brown cloaks. "Here, give<br/>these to the women."<p>Carrot took them and smiled at the man.<br/>"Thanks." He turned and started to hand them out.<br/>After a moment, four irate looking women were<br/>following the men.<p>"These things itch!" snapped Yohiko.<p>"Aiya. You don't have anything smaller?"<br/>muttered Plum.<p>"Relax, it's only temporary," said Carrot.<br/>"Quit whining and come on. We need sleep."<p>Ryoga grumbled irritably as he walked in the<br/>middle of the mess, someone on every side of him<br/>to keep him from wandering off.<p>"These three rooms will be yours for the<br/>evening," said Toras.<p>"Come on," said Yohiko as she pulled on<br/>Carrot.<p>"Um..." muttered Ryoga in confusion. "I guess,<br/>I'll take this one and you guys take that one."<p>"What? You get a room to yourself?" snorted<br/>Ukyo angrily.<p>"Well, the rest of us are girls," pointed out<br/>Usagi.<p>"He's your cousin, you stay with him, and I'll<br/>take the kid," said the chef as she pulled Plum<br/>into one of the rooms and closed the door behind<br/>her.<p>"Wait!" said Ryoga as the door closed in his<br/>face. He froze and then slowly turned to face<br/>Usagi. "I uhhh..."<p>The girl was staring at the floor with her<br/>cheeks flushing bright red. "Great."<p>"Look, I'll stay in the hall, and..." started<br/>Ryoga.<p>"No, I guess it can't hurt anything. I mean,<br/>it's not like we have anything the other hasn't<br/>seen before..." muttered the girl.<p>"But..." said Ryoga as he glanced at Carrot<br/>and Yohiko's room nervously. "I don't wanna die!"<p>"Oh, don't be such a baby. We'll be fine. It's<br/>not like I'm gonna try anything. I mean, I'm your<br/>cousin!" said Usagi irritably.<p>"But still..." whimpered Ryoga as he was<br/>pulled into the room forcibly. "I'll just stay in<br/>the hall..."<p>Usagi sighed and tossed some blankets on the<br/>ground off the bed along with a pillow. "Look, you<br/>sleep there, and I'll sleep here. We'll be fine.<br/>We're family remember? It'll be fine."<p>Ryoga sighed and nodded his head in defeat.<br/>"Fine."<p>"If you have to go to the bathroom, wake me<br/>up! I won't be angry, and we don't need to be<br/>looking for you in the morning," said Usagi<br/>firmly.<p>The boy sighed and nodded again.<p>Usagi shrugged her shoulders and started<br/>taking off her shirt and rummaged around in her<br/>traveling pack.<p>"What are you doing?" cried Ryoga in alarm.<p>"Changing clothes. Don't be such a baby!<br/>You've seen them before," snorted Usagi as she<br/>frowned at him. "Relax. I'm not gonna try<br/>anything."<p>Ryoga turned red and turned his back to her.<br/>"It's not you I'm worried about!" he replied<br/>irritably.<p>"What?" said the girl dumbly.<p>"Look I could have stopped you if I'd wanted<br/>to. I wasn't exactly saying no back then. So<br/>please keep your clothes on!"<p>Usagi blushed and sighed. "All right, but I<br/>need to change. I'm all sweaty! Just stay like<br/>that until I'm done."<p>Ryoga did just that, after a few minutes Usagi<br/>climbed into bed, and he lay down on the sheets on<br/>the ground to sleep.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma sighed as he sat up in the bed and<br/>gasped, he was covered in sweat and breathing<br/>irregularly. The Dragon King was in his female<br/>form and sighed with the cutest expression on her<br/>face. She also looked somewhat worn out. "Okay,<br/>your turn."<p>The pigtailed boy nodded and grabbed one of<br/>the two pitchers that sat on the small nightstand.<br/>He climbed out of bed and poured some of it out<br/>over his head. Herb did the same with the other<br/>pitcher and they moved back under the sheets in<br/>the opposite forms once again.<p>Ranma looked at him and smiled weakly. "This<br/>part still bugs me a bit."<p>"How so?" asked Herb as he looked at her with<br/>a small frown. They were currently lying on the<br/>sheets next to one another doing nothing.<p>"It feels weird when you first put it in<br/>there, it's not so bad after a moment, but just at<br/>first," responded Ranma with her face scrunched up<br/>slightly.<p>"I'm going away for a while tomorrow. Maybe we<br/>should try that foreplay thing I heard about while<br/>I was in Japan?" offered Herb.<p>"I ain't puttin that thing in my mouth!<br/>Gross!" said Ranma in disgust.<p>"Okay. I guess I can understand that, I don't<br/>really want to do that either," replied Herb.<p>"Yeah, how can girls do that? I mean, I heard<br/>once that they put the whole thing in there!" said<br/>Ranma with a small shudder.<p>"Yes, it does seem kind of unbelievable,"<br/>commented Herb. "How would they breathe?"<p>"I dunno, maybe they don't do it for that<br/>long? Besides, that's guy stuff. I don't wanna<br/>know what that tastes like! Ick!" responded Ranma.<p>"Maybe...if we were both girls?" said Herb<br/>with a slightly thoughtful frown. "Then it<br/>wouldn't be so bad?"<p>"Yeah, but what's the point of that? I mean,<br/>it'd just be that hole," pointed out Ranma.<p>"Well, it does seem kind of sensitive,"<br/>replied Herb.<p>"I guess so," said Ranma with a shrug.<p>"I want to touch them again too," said Herb as<br/>he looked down at Ranma's chest. "I like doing<br/>that."<p>"I think you get more out of it than I do for<br/>some reason," said Ranma as he looked at Herb's<br/>now flat chest in contemplation.<p>"I'm not sure," replied Herb.<p>"Should I turn into a girl then?" asked Herb.<p>"Where did you hear about that anyway?" said<br/>Ranma as she looked at Herb in confusion.<p>"Some Magazine I saw in Japan. I found it next<br/>to the trash. I'd heard that reading is a good way<br/>to find things out about places. It was something<br/>about 'Woman's something or other'. There was also<br/>this interesting test about 'How to tell if your<br/>boyfriend is cheating on you.'"<p>Ranma shrugged. "Oh."<p>"It was quite confusing, but there was some<br/>mention of putting it in your mouth. It's supposed<br/>to be pleasurable, but I'm not sure for who."<p>"Well, I don't want to find out that bad,"<br/>replied Ranma with a slight shudder. "Not with a<br/>guy anyway."<p>"Okay, so girl it is. I can always change back<br/>if we don't like it," said Herb. "It said<br/>something about it being 'safe sex'. I wasn't<br/>aware that there was danger in this. It doesn't<br/>seem that bad really."<p>"I dunno, most chicks are pretty weak. I guess<br/>that's more for normal girls. Maybe they get hurt<br/>easily doin stuff like that?"<p>"Hmm, could be," said Herb with a shrug.<p>"Hurry up will ya? I think I'm leakin again,"<br/>said Ranma as she lifted the sheets and looked<br/>down. "Yup. Wonder why that happens?"<p>"I'm not entirely sure," responded Herb as he<br/>poured the cold water over his head and shrugged.<br/>She sat down in the bed and climbed back in.<br/>"So...who gets to be on top?"<p>Ranma pulled out a coin and sighed. "Flip ya<br/>for it."<p>"Heads," said Herb.<p>"Tails, you got bottom," said Ranma<br/>cheerfully. "So who's first? Flip again?"<p>"I think we can both do it at the same time,"<br/>said Herb as he looked at the redhead.<p>"Oh, that makes it easier then," replied Ranma<br/>with another shrug as she started climbing on her<br/>mate.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ukyo glared at the wall opposite her with Plum<br/>next to her in the bed. The pair was sitting<br/>upright with bloodshot eyes.<p>"How long they do this?" muttered Plum.<p>"I don't know," said Ukyo irritably.<p>The screams increased in volume and the wall<br/>opposite the pair vibrated violently as Carrot and<br/>Yohiko continued their third coupling of the<br/>night.<p>"I no can sleep," said Plum.<p>"I'm going to kill them both," growled Ukyo.<p>"Tell them stop maybe?" muttered Plum.<p>"I am not going in there. I don't want to know<br/>exactly what they're doing to make this much<br/>noise," snorted Ukyo.<p>"Plum have pretty good idea," snorted the<br/>girl. Her Japanese was getting worse as the night<br/>drug on.<p>"I've lived in dorms before, so I'm familiar<br/>with it, and this is the worst I've ever heard<br/>it," snarled Ukyo.<p>"You hit Plum on head now yes? Maybe get some<br/>sleep?" muttered the girl as she looked at Ukyo.<p>"You sure?" asked the chef.<p>Plum nodded wearily.<p>"Okay," said Ukyo as she bopped the girl just<br/>hard enough to send her out.<p>"Great, at least it's just me now," she<br/>muttered as she continued to stare at the wall.<br/>One of the pictures that were hanging on the wall<br/>fell to the ground as the wall continued to shake.<p>"Damn you Ranma! Now I have one more<br/>humiliation to endure because of you!" she<br/>snarled. She fell back onto the bed and put a<br/>pillow over her face. "Sugar, you're starting to<br/>sound like Ryoga; and you're talking to yourself!"<p>Finally, the pillow's muffling of the noise,<br/>coupled with her extreme exhaustion finally sent<br/>her into her dreams.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Amazons, and the Hot Springs Demon!
