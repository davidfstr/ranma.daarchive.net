</div>Insertion<p>Part 20<p>Weirder and Weirder...<p>++++++++++++<p>Mousse sat at a small bar with a drink in his hands. He was<br/>brooding silently over the new development in his life, and was quite<br/>possibly the drunkest he'd ever been. He was inside a small casino<br/>somewhere in Tokyo. The place reminded him of his old sensei's place,<br/>and he was trying to relax a bit.<p>"Well, maybe..." he muttered as he looked up at the ceiling for a<br/>moment.<p>"Got problems?" asked the bartender as she walked up to him while<br/>cleaning a glass. She was a pretty woman in her mid twenties with<br/>short blonde hair.<p>"Man, do I," grumbled the boy as he looked up at her. She backed<br/>away, narrowly missing being poked by his four-foot long bangs.<p>"So? Woman trouble?" she commented with a slight smirk.<p>"Sorta," grumbled the boy pathetically. "Ya see, I was cast out of<br/>this crazy Chinese man hater tribe, for learning secret techniques<br/>forbidden to 'em. Now I can't marry the girl I've loved my whole life,<br/>and I don't have enough money to get back to my job in Vegas. I'm<br/>stuck in Japan, with no place to go, spending the last of my hard-<br/>earned money on booze. Man, this sucks. I-I-I just don't know what ta<br/>do! It's like, the King is eternally trapped in the Heartbreak Hotel<br/>baby."<p>The bartender blinked as she looked at him for a moment. His<br/>accent was almost flawless. "Hey, you're pretty good."<p>"Thanks babe, but that don't help me none. Gimme another drink<br/>would ya honey? The King needs a little help gettin to sleep tonight."<p>"And I thought that other guy had weird problems," muttered the<br/>bartender as she walked away.<p>Mousse blinked at the comment and looked down the bar. "Whoa<br/>momma!" Sitting a few stools down, with empty stools on either side of<br/>him was the weirdest looking guy he'd ever seen. He had a gigantic<br/>green head with no hair, and a long black trench coat. He had a somber<br/>looking frown on his face and tears were streaming down his cheeks.<br/>Resting across his shoulder was a ridiculously huge gun of some kind.<br/>It looked somewhat futuristic, with a long square barrel with some<br/>sort of lens in it.<p>Curious, he stood up and sat down next to the man. "Um, what the<br/>heck is that thing?"<p>The green headed man turned to look at him. "Huh? Oh, just my<br/>pneumatic vaporizer. Nothing special." He turned back to the drink<br/>that was resting in his palm and sighed.<p>"Why the long face?" said Mousse as he looked down at his own<br/>drink.<p>The man turned to look at him, his face was now about four feet<br/>long. "Is it really that bad?"<p>"Um...yeah," muttered Mousse as he attempted to adjust his<br/>glasses.<p>"Nothing much really, I'm being hunted by men in black suits. My<br/>parents think I'm gay, I'm in love with a girl who doesn't know I<br/>exist, and I've run out of old bullies to kill. What about you?"<p>"Um...nothing much. Just cast out of my tribe, everything else is<br/>related to that. I can't even afford a peanut butter and nanner<br/>sandwich after I leave this place."<p>The man looked at him and burst into tears. "Our lives are so<br/>pathetic! I think I'm going to turn to a life of crime!"<p>"Come on now. It can't be that bad," said Mousse as he tried to<br/>comfort the man. "You could be dead on a toilet somewhere! Or married<br/>to your own cousin, that happened to my brother. Or even worse! I<br/>could lose my hair!"<p>The man looked up at Mousse for a moment. "Huh?"<p>"Oh, sorry," muttered the Chinese boy as he realized that the man<br/>had no hair.<p>"Can...I borrow some of your hair?" said the man pathetically.<p>"Hey! Don't be gettin all personal buddy!" snapped Mousse.<p>"Oh. Okay, but still. I've run out of enemies to slay and torture.<br/>I've laid waste to all those who opposed me, technically speaking, I<br/>should be ruling the world right now."<p>"Come on. It's not so bad, some people could never say that," said<br/>Mousse with a small frown on his face.<p>"Yeah, but still..." said the man as he hung his head a little<br/>lower.<p>"Look man, I'm sure your momma would be proud," said Mousse as he<br/>pat the man on his back.<p>"Actually, she hates violence," pointed out the man.<p>"Err...right."<p>"I suppose I could become a superhero or something. I mean, it's<br/>not like I've got anything better to do...it's just that...there's not<br/>that much crime in Tokyo!" The man burst into tears again. "Why<br/>couldn't I live in America or something? No! I had to be born into a<br/>place with one of the lowest crime rates in the world! Waaaaahhhh!"<p>Mousse seemed to perk up a bit. "Hey! You could fight the Yakuza!"<p>The man looked up at him with huge shiny eyes. "R-really?"<p>"Or better yet, those demon things that keep attacking people. You<br/>could even do both!"<p>"Y-you're right! I shall become a champion of justice! A beacon of<br/>light! A hero beyond all heroes! I Okii Atama, shall make my mark upon<br/>this world at last!" A horse appeared from nowhere, and the green<br/>headed man leapt onto its back and rode through the doors and into the<br/>street.<p>"Whoa Momma! That guy is good!" said Mousse in awe.<p>The bartender frowned and walked up next to Mousse again. "I<br/>thought I told that idiot about bringing his animals into my place."<br/>She turned to face him and smirked. "You want a job? I've never seen<br/>an Asian guy as good as you are."<p>"Huh? Whatcha mean?" said Mousse as he turned to look at her for a<br/>moment.<p>The woman jerked her thumb up at a small stage on one side of the<br/>room. "I need something to fill in a spot on the weekend. My old act<br/>quit a few weeks ago."<p>"Sure," replied Mousse with a small shrug.<p>"Welcome aboard then," said the woman with a smirk forming on her<br/>face. "My name is King."<p>"Mousse," replied the boy as he bowed to her a little.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Sabotage! Fake Demolition Company Levels Auditorium in Tokyo!"<p>Ranma smirked as he put the newspaper down and sat back at his<br/>desk. "I told you it would work out."<p>Akane frowned at him for a moment and sat down opposite him. "You<br/>called me in here for something?"<p>"Yeah, here," said the boy as he handed her a small envelope.<p>"What's this?" said the girl as she looked at it for a moment<br/>without opening it.<p>"Your paycheck. We aren't doing this for free ya know," said the<br/>boy as he turned to look out the window for a moment. They were fairly<br/>high up, and it was a good view of the city.<p>"Paycheck?" mumbled the girl in confusion for a moment. She opened<br/>it and pulled out the check. After a moment of staring she looked up<br/>at Ranma. "Um...is this right?"<p>"Huh? He stood up and looked at it. "Yeah. Is there a problem?"<p>"No!" said the girl as she stood up and stared at it again. "What<br/>am I going to do with all of this?"<p>"Well, it's got to last you two weeks. Don't go spending it all in<br/>once place," said Ranma.<p>"Two weeks?" she said as she looked at him again in confusion.<p>"Yeah, that's when you get paid again," said the boy calmly.<p>"Oh my," muttered Akane as she stuck the check in her shirt.<p>"Get with Nephrite, he'll set you up with a bank account," said<br/>Ranma as he started shuffling a few of the papers on his desk for a<br/>moment.<p>"Right. I'm going now," said Akane as she moved towards the door.<p>"Home already?" said Ranma as he arched his eyebrow a little.<p>"No, I think I'll pay my sister what I owe her, and then...go buy<br/>a car or something I guess..."<p>"Right, have fun," said Ranma as he smiled at her cheerfully.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"You're right, that was funnier than I'd thought it would be,"<br/>commented Dan as he watched the girl wander off in a daze.<p>"Told ya," said Carrot.<p>"What are we gonna do for the rest of the day?" said Ranma<br/>irritably.<p>"Train most likely, we've got to think of something that can deal<br/>with that youma," said Carrot with a small sigh.<p>"I did well enough when you idiots were out cold," snorted Dan.<p>"Well, you didn't kill it either," pointed out Carrot.<p>"Yeah, but it ain't happy," retorted Dan.<p>"Still, all we've managed was pissing it off. We're gonna need<br/>something for the next time we meet," said Carrot.<p>"Can't we just talk to it?" said Pissant with a pathetic whine.<br/>"I'm sure it's reasonable. It was helping those people after all..."<p>"Like it helped that girl we found?" replied Carrot firmly.<p>"Well..." muttered Pissant.<p>"We're going to kill it," said Dan.<p>"We shouldn't though, that wouldn't be very nice," insisted the<br/>pathetic voice.<p>"And letting it run around and kill anyone it wants is nice?" said<br/>Carrot.<p>"Yeah! We can't let that thing just run around wild!" agreed<br/>Ranma. "We need to train, and that's my department."<p>"Good, we should get started then," said Carrot as he stood up.<br/>"We'll go home and get ourselves a change of clothes, then go find a<br/>nice quiet place to train."<p>"Right," said Ranma. For the first time that day he sounded<br/>cheerful.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"Hi!" cried Usagi cheerfully as she noticed Tsuki walking up to<br/>the group. They were sitting around a table in the eating area of a<br/>mall.<p>"Hey guys. What's up?" said the girl as she noticed them and<br/>walked over. She had several shopping bags under her arm.<p>"What are you doing here?" asked Makoto.<p>"Shopping of course," replied the girl with a small shrug. "How<br/>about you guys?"<p>"Were just here. I'm not sure why," said Ami as she looked at her<br/>friends.<p>"We're wasting time we could be using for more important things,"<br/>said Rei. Despite the comment she looked content with the situation.<p>"Just hanging out," said Usagi. "It's fun."<p>"I hope so, we've been doing it all day," said Makoto.<p>"We're the only ones who understand this Usagi," said Minako as<br/>she turned back from watching a nearby table with several boys around<br/>it.<p>"Where's Mamoru?" said Tsuki as she glanced around for a moment.<br/>"It's weird not seeing you dragging him around by his balls in a place<br/>like this."<p>Usagi blinked and blushed. "I umm..."<p>"Ha! Right on the nose!" said Rei cheerfully.<p>"Mamo-chan likes spending time with me!" said Usagi defensively.<p>"You don't understand men at all," said Tsuki with a smirk forming<br/>on her face.<p>"Oh, like you do?" said Makoto as she rolled her eyes.<p>"And why wouldn't I?" said the girl with a playful looking smirk.<p>None of the girls spoke a word. They looked away in embarrassment<br/>and avoided looking at her.<p>"Attracting men is an art. You have to learn the finer points of<br/>it if you want to be successful."<p>"Usagi seems to be doing well," commented Ami.<p>"Right, Usagi couldn't find her ass with both hands and a<br/>flashlight," snorted Rei.<p>"What's that supposed to mean?" snapped the girl irritably.<p>"It means you got lucky," said Tsuki as she sat down.<p>"Finally! A girl after my own heart!" said Minako cheerfully.<p>"Pick a man, any man," said Tsuki as she glanced around at the<br/>crowd.<p>"That one," said Makoto as she pointed out a particularly cute boy<br/>hanging around in a far corner.<p>"Techno geek. Note the 'Microsoft' shirt, somewhat glazed look in<br/>the eyes, and the totally false lack of interest in any of the cute<br/>girls passing by. A subtle approach would be best, followed by coming<br/>on stronger in private. Easy enough really, his kind are usually into<br/>pornography of some kind."<p>Usagi stared at her for a moment.<p>"Take that one," continued Tsuki as she pointed at a rough looking<br/>boy nearby. "He's a latent homosexual. No interest in any of the women<br/>around him, he's hiding the fact that he keeps looking at any tight<br/>male butt that passes by him, watch him for a minute. He'll catch a<br/>glimpse and then turn away."<p>Minako blinked as well, Ami looked completely uninterested, Rei<br/>had a disbelieving scowl on her face, while Makoto shrugged.<p>"She's right," said Usagi with a sick look on her face as she<br/>watched the boy watch two men pass by him.<p>"Wow," muttered Minako. "How about him?"<p>"Hmmm..." said Tsuki as she watched the boy that had been pointed<br/>out. He was hanging around with an attractive girl of about his own<br/>age. He was around eighteen, with long brown hair and a red shirt. His<br/>thumbs were hooked into the belt loops of his blue jeans and he was<br/>laughing cheerfully.<p>Tsuki smirked as she watched him for a moment. "He's got the hots<br/>for that girl he's with, but doesn't realize she's a lesbian.<br/>Plus...it's small."<p>The other girls blushed suddenly and turned away.<p>"You can tell that?" muttered Ami as she looked up from the book<br/>she had been reading.<p>"Well, he is advertising it to the world," said Tsuki with a small<br/>shrug.<p>"You mean?" muttered Minako as she turned to look at him again for<br/>a moment.<p>"Yup, hard as a rock. Can't tell can you?" said Tsuki cheerfully.<br/>She sipped at the drink she had bought earlier.<p>"Can we change the subject?" muttered Usagi as she turned a little<br/>green.<p>"I thought you liked talking about boys," said Tsuki calmly.<p>"We do, but...we're not usually this...well...frank about it,"<br/>said Ami.<p>"Too strong huh? Got ya," said Tsuki as she nodded her head and<br/>smiled. "I'm not used to this kind of stuff. Sorry."<p>"Not used to it?" said Makoto in confusion.<p>"There aren't a lot of people where I'm from," said the girl with<br/>a small shrug.<p>"Where is that?" said Makoto cheerfully. She remembered what it<br/>was like being in a new place with new people.<p>"Pluto," replied Tsuki as she continued to drink.<p>"Um...Pluto?" said Usagi dumbly.<p>"Yeah. Just me, and Mistress Pluto," replied the girl with a<br/>shrug.<p>"But, you're not from there...right? I mean, you were born here,"<br/>asked Ami.<p>"Nope. I was born on Mercury, long time ago," replied the girl<br/>with a small smirk.<p>"In your past life?" ventured Usagi.<p>"Nope," said Tsuki cheerfully. "I wasn't reborn. Been in<br/>cryostasis for few thousand years though."<p>"WHAT?" said the girls.<p>"Look, it's not that hard. I was born before the fall of the<br/>Silver Millenium. I survived the fall, and got stuck in cryostasis for<br/>a few thousand years, until you guys woke up. Pretty simple really."<p>"So...you're from the Silver Millenium?" said Makoto in awe.<p>"Yup. Let me have some of your fries," said the girl as she took<br/>some of Usagi's food while the girl was in shock.<p>The girls were all staring at her, not speaking or moving.<p>"What? I was one of the backup senshi. You all had apprentices<br/>back then, I'm just the only one who survived," replied the girl as<br/>she looked at them.<p>"Backup Senshi?" muttered Makoto as she seemed to snap out of her<br/>stupor.<p>"Yeah, we weren't as strong, but were connected with the planets<br/>well enough to do in a pinch. Pluto is one of the few planets where a<br/>backup Senshi has the potential to grow into a full senshi. It was<br/>sort of a tradition, the old senshi of Pluto would retire, and the<br/>backup senshi would take over. I think it's only happened like three<br/>or four times."<p>"Did you ever meet Queen Serenity then?" asked Usagi.<p>"Only a few times, she used to pinch my cheek and tell me how cute<br/>I was. It was annoying. I never liked her much," replied Tsuki with a<br/>shrug.<p>"You didn't like Queen Serenity?" said Rei dumbly.<p>"She was kind of like an annoying aunt, who was more beautiful<br/>than you, and ran the entire family. You didn't want to hate her, but<br/>you did. Get it?"<p>The girls blinked and nodded. Most of them could relate to that to<br/>some extent.<p>"Well, I've got to go home now. See ya later," said Tsuki as she<br/>stood up and looked at her watch.<p>As soon as the girl was gone the inner senshi turned to face one<br/>another.<p>"The Silver Millenium?" muttered Usagi in shock.<p>"So...do you think she's..." said Minako.<p>"I dunno, she could be," said Makoto as she blushed.<p>"She did get those boys dead on," pointed out Rei.<p>"She also spotted the lesbian girl," commented Ami without looking<br/>up.<p>"We aren't even sure if she was right," said Usagi flatly.<p>"Seems like she was dead on to me," said Minako. "I only wish I<br/>was that good." She frowned, she was the senshi of Venus! How could<br/>someone else be better than her at boy watching? It wasn't right.<p>"Ami is right...I've heard they can spot their own kind," said<br/>Minako.<p>"I wonder which of us was like that..." said Rei with a serious<br/>look on her face.<p>"Hey... You don't suppose that maybe...Tsuki and one of us<br/>were..." muttered Minako as she turned completely red suddenly.<p>"Could be," said Ami as she slowly lowered her book and stared at<br/>her. "I'd never thought of that."<p>"She could be secretly pining for one of us!" gasped Makoto.<p>"I hope it wasn't me," muttered Usagi with a small frown. "I'd<br/>hate to break her heart. Especially after so long..." She looked upset<br/>with the idea.<p>"None of us is safe then," commented Minako. "I'm sure of it! One<br/>of us was Tsuki's lover in the past!"<p>"I think you're just letting your imagination run away with you<br/>again," said Rei. "Look, we aren't even sure if she is."<p>"It is very possible that she's right though," said Ami as she<br/>turned her gaze back down to her book again.<p>The inner senshi became silent, sitting around the table quietly<br/>for a long time.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>"Where are we?" grumbled Ranma as they walked into a vacant lot<br/>near to the dojo. There had been a light rain, and they were currently<br/>female at the moment.<p>"We can practice here," said Carrot calmly.<p>"Why not the dojo?" muttered Dan.<p>"Because we don't want to blow the place up," replied Carrot<br/>calmly.<p>"What are we gonna do about that thing?" said Ranma seriously. "We<br/>need a plan of attack."<p>"Plans usually don't survive first contact with the enemy," said<br/>Dan flatly.<p>"Whatever, we need to find a weakness," said Carrot. "Fire seems<br/>to be his element, so we go with ice, or water. Hell, maybe we should<br/>just cover him with dirt..."<p>"This is serious," snapped Ranma.<p>"I was being serious. Who knows? It might work," said Carrot.<p>"I think we should go home and have a nice cup of tea. That helps<br/>us think," said Pissant cheerfully.<p>"You know, you're not smart enough to trick us into going home.<br/>Just sit there and shut up if you aren't going to offer anything<br/>useful," said Carrot.<p>"Actually, that doesn't sound like a bad idea," said Ranma.<br/>"Training would be pointless if we didn't think of something first.<br/>It's obvious being a little stronger and faster isn't going to help us<br/>much. We've got to find a way to really hurt him."<p>"That attack we tried could work," pointed out Dan. "It hurt him."<p>"Yeah, but it hurt us more," said Carrot.<p>"He's right. We could toughen up our hands, but that might only<br/>give us a few more shots. It didn't hurt him that much," said Ranma as<br/>he looked at their palms for a moment.<p>"Something cold?" said Carrot to himself. "I haven't got a<br/>clu...wait..."<p>"What is it?" said Dan.<p>"I may have something, but we're gonna need that Ghoul's help to<br/>do it," said Carrot.<p>"What's that?" said Dan.<p>"The Hiryu Shoten Ha," said Carrot with a grin. "If you recall, it<br/>uses an icy blast, and the heat of an opponent's battle aura. Against<br/>a fire monster, it could be the edge we need."<p>"So, we go back to the ghoul?"<p>"We're gonna have to think of something to get her to teach us<br/>without marrying Shampoo..."<p>++++++++++++++<p>As if cued by some invisible force, a withered cry echoed across<br/>the lot.<p>"Akane!"<p>"What the?" said Ranma as she turned to face the newcomer.<p>It was a tiny old man. He jumped forward and reached for her<br/>breasts, only to find his intended target vanishing from in front of<br/>him.<p>"Hey. It's Happosai," said the redhead.<p>The little old man paused and looked at her. "Pardon me dear. Have<br/>we met before?"<p>"You're the grandmaster of the Anything Goes School," said Ranma<br/>as she smirked and pointed at him for a moment.<p>"Oh? You seem to know me, but I..." Happosai narrowed his eyes and<br/>became very cautious.<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome, son of that idiot Genma," replied the girl.<p>"Son?" muttered Happosai as he stared at her.<p>"That's right," said the redhead cheerfully.<p>Happosai narrowed his eyes for a moment and nodded. "I see. How is<br/>your father these days?"<p>"As stupid as ever," replied the girl with a small shrug. "We're<br/>staying with Soun. Those two are trying to pass off some engagement<br/>thing onto me."<p>"Together are they?" muttered the old man with a thoughtful frown.<p>"Yeah. They claim they killed you, I figured they were to stupid<br/>to get it right," said the girl as she poked her finger into her ear<br/>and scratched it for a moment.<p>"Haw! You got that right!" cackled Happosai.<p>"Going to kill them now?" said Ranma as she smiled at the old man<br/>for a moment.<p>"No. I've got business with them actually," replied the old man<br/>cheerfully. "I'm not here for revenge though, so don't worry."<p>"Gee, that's too bad," commented Ranma as she turned and started<br/>walking away. "Come on, I'll take you to them."<p>"Too bad?" muttered Happosai to himself. "Lead on!" he cried as he<br/>leapt forward.<p>The girl vanished again and appeared beside him. "Keep your hands<br/>to yourself too."<p>Happosai blinked and turned to look at her in confusion before<br/>following again.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>By the time they reached the dojo, the old man was panting for<br/>breath and almost crawling on the pavement. Ranma was starting to wear<br/>down as well after repeated use of her secret technique to dodge the<br/>pervert.<p>"You're good. That idiot Genma trained you?" muttered Happosai as<br/>he looked at the gates. He was starting to have doubts about seeing<br/>his students again, especially if they were involved in training<br/>someone who could dodge him repeatedly this well.<p>"I'm a hundred times better than that fat fool will ever be,"<br/>snorted the redhead.<p>"Confident too," said the old man carefully.<p>"Well, they aren't expecting you," said Ranma with a small shrug.<br/>"I'm not going to pass up seeing the looks on their faces when you<br/>show up."<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"What about that technique?" said Ranma angrily as they followed<br/>the old man into the dojo.<p>"Tomorrow," replied Carrot calmly.<p>"But..." said Ranma.<p>"Shut up and play along for now. I think I may have found a reason<br/>for Cologne to train us in that technique without her trying to force<br/>us to marry Shampoo," commented Carrot.<p>"Really? What is it?" asked Ranma.<p>Dan seemed to catch on. "We're looking at him."<p>Pissant spoke up suddenly. "Why do I get the feeling you two know<br/>more than you're saying?"<p>"Now that...is a secret," replied Carrot with a small chuckle.<p>"I don't like this old man, but you two seem to know him. Ranma's<br/>never met him either. What's going on?" said the whiny voice.<p>"Shut up or I'll put out head through this wall," said Dan. "Come<br/>on. I don't want to miss this."<p>They walked into the dojo with Happosai and closed the gate behind<br/>them.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: The best made plans...<p>
