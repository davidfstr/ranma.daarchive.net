</div>Insertion<p>Part 88<p>101 reasons to hate Usagi Tsukino.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>A week had gone by on Jurai, parties were attended, dances were<br/>formal, and life for Trunks basically sucked. He had grown to hate the<br/>socialites of Jurai.<p>"I'm not going to another stupid party," grumbled the boy as he<br/>glared at Hotaru irritably.<p>"It's not that bad, the celebrations should stop soon though,"<br/>said the girl as she smirked at him.<p>The boy was sitting on his giant bed, which he'd also grown to<br/>hate, because he had to walk ten feet just to get to the floor if he<br/>was in the middle of the bed. He was wearing his martial arts uniform,<br/>as was Hotaru. "Screw being polite, I'm sick of this. I've got work to<br/>do."<p>"If you say so," replied the girl with a small shrug. "I doubt if<br/>anyone will miss you, and those Senshi of yours are growing accustomed<br/>to these parties."<p>"What do you mean 'those senshi of yours'? You're one of them ya<br/>know," replied the boy flatly.<p>"I suppose so," said the girl with a slightly irritated frown. "In<br/>any case, they seem to be enjoying themselves."<p>"Usagi seems to have a panic attack every time I show up at one of<br/>those things though," grumbled the boy irritably. "I haven't done<br/>anything yet..."<p>:"You've been surprisingly well behaved, for someone who was<br/>permanently banned from any formal occasion by the queen herself all<br/>those years ago."<p>"Well, I'm not all him anymore ya know," grumbled the boy as he<br/>glanced at her for a moment.<p>"Yes, I had noticed that," replied the girl with a smirk forming<br/>on her lips.<p>"At any rate, I'm declining the next few invitations. I don't need<br/>to be polite to save face for the others anymore, they can stand on<br/>their own reputation now."<p>"Hmmm," agreed Hotaru as she looked down at the magazine that was<br/>sitting in her lap for a moment.<p>"What's that?" said the boy as he hopped over to her side and<br/>peered over her shoulder.<p>"Just something I picked up while I was out. I got bored," replied<br/>the girl with a small shrug. "Tenchi is Jurai's sexiest man." She held<br/>up a page to him with the boy's face on it. Next to it was a full body<br/>shot from one of the parties. He looked somewhat nervous.<p>"Good for him," said the boy as he shrugged.<p>"You're actually quite popular yourself," said the girl as she<br/>held up another page. "According to this, you'll be one of the most<br/>eligible bachelors in the Universe. With you being a prince and<br/>all..."<p>"I'm the prince of like, five other people, and two of them are<br/>trying to kill me," said the boy as he blinked and looked at the page.<br/>It was in a 'teen' section of the magazine. "This is..." He stared at<br/>it for a moment. There was a full body shot of him standing with his<br/>arms crossed over his chest with a smirk on his face. It was taken<br/>directly from his battle with Buu, probably one of the satellites that<br/>had broadcasted the fight to the ships in space. "I'm...a teen idol?"<br/>he muttered dumbly.<p>"Yes, apparently you're adorable," said the girl as she smirked at<br/>him.<p>"But...I'm not even ten yet," muttered the boy with a slightly<br/>sour frown.<p>"You're popular with the thirteen and under set," said the girl<br/>with a small shrug.<p>"Oh," said the boy as he flopped down and flipped through the<br/>pages for a time. "Hey, you're pretty popular yourself. There's that<br/>weenie Cerio...man, his fan club is pissed at me."<p>"Yes, the entire planet is questioning his manhood thanks to your<br/>comment," replied Hotaru as she smirked at him.<p>"That guy is in serious denial then," said Trunks with a smirk.<br/>"Seems Usagi is pretty popular too, so is Rei. Well, all of them<br/>really, but they get the highest ranking. How little these idiots<br/>know."<p>"What? You don't think they are...attractive?" said Hotaru as she<br/>arched her eyebrow at him.<p>"Usagi is a klutz, and Rei is a complete and total bitch most of<br/>the time."<p>"Ah," said Hotaru as she nodded in understanding at this.<p>"Come to think of it, that kinda puts Rei right in with these<br/>Juraian royal types. Go figure," continued the boy with a small shrug.<br/>"Ryoko sure is getting a lot of publicity too. Heh, they don't know<br/>what to make of her."<p>"I'm not surprised, considering her last visit here brought about<br/>untold destruction and the loss of a first prince."<p>Trunks smirked at this and shook his head. "Oddly enough, Yosho is<br/>taking a back seat in all this. I've barely heard any mention of him<br/>returning. It should be a big deal. Only thing I've seen are these<br/>reports of him going off to marry Ryoko, and that they were secret<br/>lovers or something."<p>"Oh, you mean the story where she got angry with Azusa for not<br/>allowing them to marry and ended up blowing up half the planet in<br/>order to 'escape with her lover'?" said Hotaru cheerfully.<p>"Yeah, something like that. It seems awfully played down to me."<p>"Wonder if Azusa has anything to do with that?" wondered Hotaru<br/>out loud.<p>"It's very possible," said Washuu as she strolled into the room<br/>and smiled at the pair.<p>"Hey, what's up?" said Trunks cheerfully as he sat up and grinned<br/>at her.<p>Washuu smiled at him. "It's ready."<p>The boy got an odd looking grin on his face, one that made even<br/>Hotaru nervous. "Excellent," he said as he steepled his fingers<br/>together.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo was getting annoyed with this place, not so much by<br/>the rich living and servants, but the idiot publicist and their<br/>questions. "Which planet are you the senshi of?" she grumbled in<br/>irritation as she walked. She gave a disgusted sounding snort at this<br/>and continued to walk down the hall towards her room. She had been<br/>associated with the Senshi more and more, mostly because she was<br/>usually seen with them. This gave her a pause, she stopped her stroll<br/>and turned towards one of the massive windows that gave her a view of<br/>the planet's surface.<p>"I have been spending a lot of time around them. There isn't<br/>really anything else for me to do around here." She wasn't sure if she<br/>liked that idea or not. The girls were the only people she really felt<br/>comfortable around on the planet. She didn't speak to them much, but<br/>they were friendly and welcomed her presence. Most of them were easily<br/>manipulated by a few choice phrases or a little prodding.<p>The girl frowned a little at that; she didn't see how they were<br/>destined to rule the world one day as they claimed. Trunks seemed<br/>agreeable with them, but she didn't see how they could as easily as<br/>she seemed to maneuver them. They mostly just hung around each other<br/>and talked for the most part, she would hang back and only<br/>occasionally give her input on a given situation. They would usually<br/>listen to her and seemed to accept her presence mostly. She wasn't as<br/>friendly with the rest of the group as they were with her.<p>"I don't get it," she muttered as she continued to stare out the<br/>window.<p>"Don't get what?" asked a familiar voice from behind her.<p>"Huh? It's nothing," said Nabiki as she turned to see Mihoshi<br/>standing there with her usual cheerful grin. She was dressed in her<br/>Galaxy Police uniform and had a notebook under her arm. "Haven't seen<br/>you for a while."<p>The woman nodded and smiled at her even more brightly. It unnerved<br/>Nabiki a bit. "Yes, I had to return to headquarters and give a<br/>report."<p>"That's right, you're some sort of cop," said Nabiki to herself.<p>"Um, yeah," said the bubbly woman as she winked at her.<p>"Trunks has weird friends," said Nabiki with a small shrug.<p>"That isn't very nice," muttered Mihoshi with a small frown on her<br/>face. It quickly vanished though and she shrugged.<p>"I'm not a very nice person," said Nabiki with a somewhat<br/>thoughtful cock of her head.<p>"Really?" said Mihoshi as she stared at the girl.<p>"I never really thought about it much before, but I don't think I<br/>am," replied Nabiki as she nodded. It didn't seem to bother her that<br/>much.<p>"Well, better be good, or I'll have to arrest you," said Mihoshi<br/>cheerfully.<p>Nabiki smirked at this and shook her head in amusement. "I'll<br/>remember that."<p>"Well, I should be going, goodbye," said the blonde as she started<br/>walking away.<p>"Right, I should find something to do myself," said Nabiki as she<br/>sighed.<p>"Don't worry, I've got just the thing," said Trunks as he walked<br/>up to her from behind.<p>Nabiki turned and stared at him for a moment. "What?"<p>"Come on, we've got to go get the others," said Trunks as he<br/>motioned for her to follow him.<p>The girl blinked and started after him, unsure of what else to do.<br/>"Where are we going?"<p>"You'll see," he replied calmly.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo was standing on a boat staring out into the sea. "What<br/>the hell am I doing?" she muttered to herself as she watched Japan<br/>fade away into the distance. They were traveling on a rather large<br/>yacht that belonged to Kunzite. It was really a miniature sea borne<br/>base of operations, with several computers and some monitoring systems<br/>onboard.<p>Trunks and Gohan were simply standing there watching the opposite<br/>horizon without speaking to anyone else.<p>Nephrite jerked upright and blinked. He had been leaning against<br/>the side of the boat with his eyes closed and his arms crossed over<br/>his shoulder. "Do you hear something?"<p>Akane turned to look at him and blinked. "Huh?"<p>Trunks and Gohan remained still, but Akane saw them tense up for<br/>just a moment. She turned her head towards Nephrite and frowned. "Like<br/>what?"<p>Jadeite walked up, attracted by the conversation. "You hear<br/>something? Probably just the waves."<p>"No, it's coming from inside the ship," said Kunzite as he<br/>appeared from inside the cabin of the ship.<p>Zocite was with him and looked somewhat annoyed. "Rats?"<p>"I hate rats," grumbled Akane angrily as she clutched her arms a<br/>little tighter.<p>"There it is again," said Jadeite as he cocked his head.<br/>"It's...tapping?"<p>"Don't worry about it, the ocean causes a lot of strange noises,"<br/>said Gohan as he glanced back at them.<p>"Nothing this rhythmic," said Kunzite as he heard the sound as<br/>well. "There's something on board the ship."<p>"Um, no there isn't," said Gohan.<p>Trunks was staring out at sea, seemingly ignoring the situation.<br/>No one saw the pensive looking frown on his face.<p>"It's coming from this storage compartment," said Jadeite as he<br/>pointed down at a latch on the deck.<p>"Uh-oh," muttered Gohan under his breath.<p>"Shit, I thought I told you to use more drugs," grumbled Trunks.<p>"I didn't want to kill him," said Gohan as he whispered back at<br/>his companion harshly. "That would kinda defeat the whole point of<br/>bringing him along!"<p>Jadeite opened the latch and stepped back with a surprised looking<br/>frown on his face. "What the?"<p>A young boy in his twenties was curled up inside the compartment<br/>with his hands and feet tied together. He had a gag over his mouth and<br/>stared up at the man in frightened confusion.<p>"What the hell is this?" cried Akane as she stared at him.<p>"Looks like our friends took a prisoner," said Nephrite as he<br/>turned to look at the pair.<p>"Sorry, we didn't have time to explain..." said Gohan as he<br/>scratched the back of his head.<p>"Hey, I know this guy. He works for us," said Akane dumbly.<p>"Huh?" said Jadeite as he turned to look at the boy for a moment.<p>"I don't know him," said Nephrite.<p>"He works in the auto shop," said Akane in confusion. "What the<br/>hell is he doing here?"<p>"He's rather important," said Gohan.<p>"That's enough," muttered Trunks.<p>"Right," said Gohan with a small sigh. "Well, I suppose we should<br/>let him go, now that they know about it..."<p>"Let him go? What the hell did you two idiots do?" cried Jadeite<br/>angrily.<p>"We kinda kidnapped him, sorry. We didn't have time to explain<br/>things too him," said Gohan as he backed away from them.<p>"Who is he?" asked Akane dumbly as she pulled him out of the hold<br/>and began to work on his ropes. He was something of a wimp and she<br/>doubted if she'd have much trouble subduing him if he caused any<br/>problems.<p>"His name is Keiichi Morisato," said Trunks. "He doesn't look it,<br/>but he's very important. We need to keep him out of sight for the time<br/>being."<p>"Why?" said Akane.<p>"Because some very important and powerful people are going to be<br/>looking for him. We'll need them later on, and if he dies, they won't<br/>be available to us," explained the longhaired boy calmly. "Sorry if we<br/>were a bit harsh about it, but it's very important."<p>"Do we have any other guests?" grumbled Jadeite as he glared at<br/>the pair.<p>"Um...no?" said Gohan as he scratched the back of his head.<p>"Idiot," muttered Trunks as he glared at him.<p>"Come on, I suppose we should find them," growled Nephrite as he<br/>glared at the pair and started walking away.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Shampoo was irritated, the place she was hidden away in was dark<br/>and cramped, and the ropes that bound her were rather tight. She<br/>growled in frustration as she tugged at them and glared forward at the<br/>ceiling. Eventually she would be able to work her way out of the<br/>bindings and escape. Unfortunately, that would take several hours.<br/>"Shampoo kill when escape," grumbled the girl angrily as she continued<br/>to tug at the ropes.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Cologne sipped at her tea and sat inside another hidden<br/>compartment on the ship. She was calm and relaxed, the two boys who<br/>had kidnapped her and Shampoo were very polite thus far. She cocked<br/>her head as she remembered them coming into the restaurant and<br/>explaining that it was very important that they escaped Japan with<br/>them. They promised explanations later and carried her rather gently<br/>to the ship while flying.<p>It made her feel like a young girl again to be carried away like<br/>she had been. Plus, these powerful fighters had told her they were<br/>planning to visit her village. Quite fine specimens the both of them.<br/>No doubt she could find them both nice wives without too much trouble.<br/>She had considered not allowing them to take her, but her curiosity<br/>got the better of her and she remained. They even made her a nice<br/>lunch to tide her over for the trip.<p>Unfortunately, Shampoo had been less than cooperative with them.<br/>They managed to subdue her without knocking her out and carried her<br/>into the air. That stopped her struggles rather quickly and they tied<br/>her up. Technically, it was a defeat, but she needed something a bit<br/>more solid for the counsel to buy into it. She'd goad one of them into<br/>knocking her out by accident or something once she was sure which of<br/>them was the better catch. She could probably do it before they<br/>reached the village. Seeing as most of those aboard could not fly.<p>"It's nice how things work out sometimes," she said to herself<br/>cheerfully.<p>The door above her head opened and she smiled cheerfully at the<br/>face that stared down at her. "Oh, hello."<p>Akane blinked as she stared at the old woman. "I've found another<br/>one!" she called to someone behind her.<p>"Do I get to come out now? How nice," said the old woman<br/>cheerfully as she picked up her staff from the ground at her side.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome smirked at the group in front of him and walked back<br/>and fourth. He looked them all up and down and they stared at him in<br/>confusion. Each of them had a large green duffel bag in front of them.<br/>The bags were filled, but no one could see what was inside. They also<br/>had large backpacks on them with a lot of pockets on them.<p>"What's going on?" asked Usagi dumbly.<p>Nabiki frowned at Trunks as he glanced at the girl and smiled.<br/>"He's up to something. I don't like this."<p>"We're only going on a little trip," said the boy.<p>He pulled out a small laptop computer and tapped a few of the keys.<br/>Washuu appeared on the screen and smiled at him. "Hello," she said<br/>with a cheerful smile. In the background behind her, a muscular man in<br/>a thong was being held in the air by mechanical arms. He had a<br/>panicked look in his eyes and was crying like a baby.<p>"Oh? Am I interrupting anything?" said Trunks as he smiled at this.<p>"Nothing important, just an...experiment," said Washuu cheerfully.<p>"Right," said the boy as he smirked at her. "You finished the<br/>systems check right?"<p>"Everything is ready, anytime you want to go in," said the woman<br/>as she grinned at him.<p>"Just don't forget you've got your own projects to worry about,"<br/>said the boy calmly as he nodded.<p>"This is just a little distraction," said Washuu cheerfully as she<br/>waved her hand at him. "Everything is on schedule. I'll be going into<br/>my special room later today and finishing that up. I should be out a<br/>few hours after you come back."<p>"Right," said Trunks as he shook his head and shut down the<br/>transmission.<p>"Where are we going?" asked Usagi.<p>"Pick up your gear ladies, it's time to go," said Trunks.<p>The group looked at the ship next to them for a moment in<br/>confusion. The Mikon Taka was sitting there and was shut down<br/>completely.<p>"This way," said Trunks as he opened a door from nothing and<br/>pushed it open wide.<p>The girls all blinked at this and the boy waved his arm for them<br/>to enter. They all did so, not sure of what else to say or do.<p>Trunks smirked and stepped in behind them. " Oh? You're coming?"<br/>he asked Hotaru as she floated down behind him from the air.<p>"Heh, I wouldn't miss this," replied the girl as she walked in<br/>behind him.<p>"I suppose I could always use a little help," said the boy as he<br/>nodded at her.<p>The door closed behind them, sealing all those inside for the rest<br/>of a day for anyone outside, and an entire year for anyone inside.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>The girls looked around at the room; they were standing inside<br/>what appeared to be a long hallway with an open wall on the opposite<br/>side leading into a large field. There were several bunks on the end<br/>they were standing on, and what appeared to be metal picnic tables on<br/>the other end. The floors were polished to a shine and everything had<br/>a sort of sterile look to it. The bunks were all made up uniformly<br/>with dark green sheets, and a large open locker sat against the wall<br/>just behind them.<p>"What is this place?" muttered Rei in confusion.<p>"Your new home for the next year," said Trunks as he looked at<br/>them all. Hotaru was beside him with her arms crossed over her chest.<br/>"It's going to stay looking like this too, or else."<p>The girls all blinked at this, not sure of what to say.<p>"This is a room of my own design, actually, it's more of a<br/>subspace dimension than a room. It's whatever I want it too be outside<br/>these walls." He pointed his finger and it started snowing outside the<br/>room. The ground appeared to be made of simple brown dirt before, and<br/>in an instant it was covered in three feet of snow.<p>"Wow," said Usagi as she stared at the scene.<p>"Heh, the amazement wears off I assure you. You're all stuck here,<br/>no one can enter or leave this room for an entire year," said the boy<br/>as he watched them all calmly.<p>"What!" cried Rei in horror.<p>"Relax, only a day will pass outside, that's why this room is in<br/>another dimension. It's to protect the time stream outside from the<br/>adverse effects of the different time field."<p>The girls all relaxed slightly at this, but didn't look too much<br/>happier.<p>"What the hell are we going to do for an entire year?" cried<br/>Minako as she stomped her foot.<p>"You really want to know?" said Trunks as his evil looking grin<br/>widened.<p>"Of course!" cried the girl in frustration.<p>"Heh," said Trunks as he turned to look at Hotaru. "Well, for<br/>starters, all your senshi powers have been sealed away for the<br/>duration of this trip."<p>The girls all looked at him dumbly.<p>"The reason you're here is simple. You call yourself pretty<br/>soldiers? Well, I'm gonna turn you into real soldiers."<p>"Um...you can do that?" said Usagi as she stared at the boy.<p>"Well, I know enough about it, plus I've got a little help with<br/>it." He nodded his head and smiled. "From now on, you'll call me sir."<br/>The boy put a cap on with two silver bars on the front of it. "She's<br/>Ma'am," he handed Hotaru a cap with a single silver bar on it.<p>"This is Drill Sargent Fuller," the boy jerked his thumb back at<br/>the towering figure who seemed to melt from the shadows. He was a<br/>massive black man with arms as big around as the girl's waists. He had<br/>a vicious looking snarl on his face and cracked his knuckles as he<br/>stared them all down from under the rim of his large round hat.<p>"You can call me...Drill Sargent." He chuckled at the girls as<br/>they backed away from him slowly with horrified looking expressions on<br/>their faces.<p>"You...you can't do this too me!" cried Nabiki as she stepped<br/>forward and stared at Trunks with rage in her eyes. There was also a<br/>large amount of fear.<p>"Heh, you're here with us for the year. You work, or you don't<br/>eat," he replied calmly. "We don't have enough food to waste on<br/>someone who isn't training."<p>The girl stepped back and stared at him, there was nothing she<br/>could do. "I'll tell them who you really are!" she cried desperately.<p>"Tell them, it doesn't matter anymore," replied the boy as he<br/>shrugged. "After this is over, they won't like me anyway. They'll<br/>respect me though."<p>Nabiki gasped at this and looked at the huge man standing over her<br/>in terror. Usagi had started to cry, and Minako was clutching Rei<br/>fearfully, much to the dark haired senshi's annoyance. Ami and Makoto<br/>were simply looking up at him with their mouths open.<p>"Are they mine yet?" asked the towering man as he looked at<br/>Trunks.<p>"Not quite, I've still got a few more things to explain to them,<br/>and I'll turn them over too you," said the boy as he smirked at him.<p>"Drill Sargent Fuller is an artificial program. Created from<br/>military files and textbooks on training from the United States Armed<br/>Forces. You'll get a little bit of everything from him. He's<br/>unbribeable, ruthless, and he doesn't like you. Don't try to reason<br/>with him, do what your told, and you'll be fine."<p>The girls were all listening to him very carefully at this point.<br/>"In this reality, you can't die, but you can be killed. Don't think<br/>for a second that it won't hurt either. Every injury, every wound will<br/>look and feel real. If you die, you'll be revived in about an hour. I<br/>suggest you avoid that, take it from someone who knows. Dying really<br/>sucks."<p>"Um...he's going to kill us?" said Usagi fearfully.<p>"No, he won't," said Trunks as he shook his head. "His job is to<br/>make you wish you were dead. You won't have to worry about dying until<br/>later, he won't hurt you. Well, he will hurt you, but he won't put you<br/>in any real danger. That comes later on."<p>The Drill Sargent grinned at them all; a single gold tooth<br/>sparkled in his maw as he looked them over. "Hurting is good for ya,<br/>lets ya know yer still alive. I'm gonna show you every kinda pain,<br/>you'll love it."<p>"Well Sargent Fuller, they're all yours."<p>"Yes sir," replied the massive man as he stormed forward. He<br/>glared at the girls. "I'm gonna show ya what yer locker's gonna look<br/>like from now on. Ya'd better learn it real good."<p>"Yessir," muttered Usagi in terror as he glared directly down at<br/>her.<p>"SIR! I WORK FOR A LIVING! YOU WILL CALL ME DRILL SARGENT AND<br/>ONLY DRILL SARGENT! YOU WILL BEGIN AND END EVERY SENTENCE YOU SPEAK<br/>FROM NOW ON WITH DRILL SARGENT! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?" screamed the<br/>man as he put his nose up to her face and got a look of rage so<br/>horrifying that the girl almost passed out right there.<p>"Yessir," muttered Usagi as any possible intelligence hidden<br/>within the depths of her mind ran away and shit itself from terror.<p>"EVERYBODY OUTSIDE! I FEEL LIKE RUNNING A FEW HUNDRED LAPS!"<p>"You were right! This will be fun!" said Hotaru as she smirked at<br/>the boy next to her.<p>"Heh, I'll start turning up the gravity a little at a time in a<br/>week. We won't ever get up to our normal level, but I think they'll be<br/>able to withstand twenty times or by the time this is over."<p>Hotaru nodded and smiled cheerfully at the boy. "This part will<br/>take about eight weeks or so?"<p>"Yeah, then we get into the real meat of the training," said<br/>Trunks with a serious nod. "That's when they can die, and we'll get<br/>some real laughs out of that."<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Makoto Kino's journal: Entry one<p>We got a few notepads with our gear, Drill Sargent says they're<br/>for writing letters home. He also said something about earning phone<br/>privileges through hard work. I don't see what good that will do us,<br/>seeing as there's no one on the entire planet we can call really. I<br/>asked Trunks about it, he says there's still some bugs to work out of<br/>Fuller's system. That scares me frankly.<p>We're working hard, we've been up for two days straight now. The<br/>Drill Sargent yells at us all the time and makes us do painful<br/>exercises. Nabiki, Rei, and myself seem to be doing the best at that.<br/>Nabiki says she did aerobics to keep herself fit, but we're all in<br/>pain and can barely move. Drill Sargent says we get some sleep<br/>tonight, after we clean the billets. That's what he calls the room we<br/>stay in. He won't let us start for another hour though, we get what he<br/>calls 'personal time' seeing as I can't really write letters, I<br/>decided to do this. It looks like most of us have the same idea.<p>We're all wearing camouflage uniforms, they have our names on them<br/>in Romanji, but no tag specifying what service we're in. Ami says it's<br/>Army Training from what she sees. We have to keep our hair pinned up<br/>above our necks now; he isn't making us get it cut though. It has to<br/>be able to fit under our covers, what he makes us call our caps. I<br/>hate this place already; I don't see how we're going to make it.<p>Usagi has the worst of it; she's terrified of the man. He won't<br/>leave her alone, I feel so sorry for her. We can't do anything to help<br/>her either, our powers are locked up and he's as strong as he looks.<br/>Not that we've tried, but I saw him lift a few ten foot long logs as<br/>if they were made of paper the other day when he was building a large<br/>pit just outside to fill with water for mud. I don't really want to<br/>know what that's for.<p>That girl Nabiki stopped talking. We don't know her that well, but<br/>she's been a friend of sorts since this whole mess started. She seems<br/>to have taken too this rather well I think. She does what she's told<br/>and tries to stay out of sight. I think she's just as scared of him as<br/>we are, but she doesn't show it. The stress of this is getting to all<br/>of us, and there's no escape.<p>Ami can't move around much, the same for Usagi. Minako is a little<br/>better, but not much. They were complaining about every part of their<br/>body being sore, it's the same for me, but I'm in better shape. I know<br/>it must be really hard for them.<p>The weather outside has been perfect so far, but I know it's only<br/>a matter of time before Trunks starts making it harder for us. He<br/>seems indifferent to our suffering, we've tried talking too him, but<br/>he ignores us and states that if we want to eat, we have to work. I<br/>don't see why we need this; we were doing fine... well maybe not.<br/>Still, I don't see how this is going to help us.<p>The man is horrible to us, all he does is yell and force us to run<br/>and sweat in painful ways. If one of us screws up, we all do. Those<br/>are his exact words, we've always worked as a team, I hope we can get<br/>through this.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>Makoto's journal: Entry Two<p>It's been three days since I last wrote anything in this book. We<br/>get sleep now, but only six hours at most. We're outside before light,<br/>and we don't come back until the sun comes down. Most of what we do is<br/>physical, Trunks says there's a few classes he had to edit out of the<br/>program. So far we've learned about some of our equipment and he's<br/>teaching us how to march. Next week we get gas masks, I don't think<br/>that's good. Why would we need them?<p>Another thing bothers me, we got weapons today. We have to call<br/>them weapons, Usagi has trouble speaking without getting herself into<br/>trouble, we try to railroad him away from her, but he seems to single<br/>her out more than anyone else. Our new weapons are called M-16 A2s. We<br/>don't need guns, the very idea offends me. Still, we have to do what<br/>we're told. None of us like it one bit though. We're learning to<br/>adjust the sights, clean, and disassemble the weapons right now, but I<br/>know it's only a matter of time before we end up firing them.<p>We're constantly under his thumb, all day every day. He's<br/>constantly criticizing us; nothing we do is good enough. Plus, he<br/>forces us to act like we enjoy this torture. During what he calls<br/>'PT', or the workout portion of our training. He makes us say things<br/>like. "We like it, we love it, we want some more of it. Make it hurt<br/>Drill Sargent, make it hurt!" I feel stupid and humiliated; I've never<br/>felt so inadequate in my life. His favorite torture is making us run<br/>'until he feels tired'.<p>Usagi is trying hard, but she keeps screwing up. That girl Nabiki<br/>keeps giving her angry glares. It's not the poor girl's fault, I'm<br/>kind of upset with her, but in a way I also understand. It's hard on<br/>all of us.<p>We discovered what he was building outside with those logs as<br/>well. He calls it 'The Pit'. Over the past few days we've learned all<br/>about it, and we regret every moment. The pit is where he forces us to<br/>roll around, crawl, run, push up, and basically hurt ourselves in the<br/>most grueling experience of my life. He literally has us in there<br/>until we can barely stand. It's the place we go when he decides to<br/>punish us for some imagined insult. His favorite game is to ask us<br/>questions he knows we can't answer and then send us out there for a<br/>half-hour or so. The man is sick, twisted, and completely revolting.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Makoto's Journal: Entry Three<p>I wish I could put a date to this. I'm not sure what month it is<br/>anymore, much less what day. It's been about a week since my last<br/>entry. Things aren't getting much better, but we are getting through a<br/>little easier. The physical part doesn't hurt so much anymore. Even<br/>Usagi isn't rendered completely helpless any longer. Doing something<br/>to the point of muscle failure isn't rare, but we recover much faster.<br/>It seems warmer in here also, and if I didn't know better, I'd think<br/>that we're growing weaker. Everything seems to be heavier now, if only<br/>a little.<p>I found out why we needed gas masks. I wish I hadn't. Fuller took<br/>us to a small building, and put us into a small room. He then<br/>proceeded to break several gas capsules in the middle of the room. We<br/>were forced to put on our masks in less than a minute, and had to<br/>clear them of the gas before we could breathe. It was horrible, we<br/>went outside and we were covered in snot, tears were pouring down our<br/>faces, and Usagi and Minako got really sick. The stuff burned, it was<br/>awful. It took a long time before it wore off. Why is he doing this to<br/>us? What did we do?<p>Yesterday, we fired our weapons. We were taken out to a range and<br/>fired at targets. Fuller explained a lot of things to us, how to hold<br/>the weapon, how to keep score on the targets, that sort of thing. Rei<br/>shot him. He laughed at her and beat her up pretty badly. She's not<br/>seriously hurt, but it was a devastating blow to all of us. She cried<br/>herself to sleep that night, I almost couldn't bear the sound of it.<br/>We went to Trunks about that, and he simply snorted and said 'Now<br/>she'll no better than to try something like that. Those aren't toys.'<br/>That bastard. Hotaru is a little more understanding, but she didn't do<br/>anything either. She watches us a lot, but doesn't say much and tends<br/>to keep to herself.<p>This is wearing us down, I yelled at Usagi today. I felt pretty<br/>bad about it, but it didn't last long. She screwed up again during a<br/>march and we were forced to run. I feel so sorry for her, she's<br/>trying, but...she's causing us so much pain. I hate to say it, but I<br/>wish she hadn't come with us. We got little knives called bayonets,<br/>they attach to the front of our weapons. That part wasn't so bad, we<br/>had to run up and stab little dummies made up to look like Trunks and<br/>Fuller. The man actually seemed to enjoy watching us do it. It's<br/>disturbing.<p>We've got the marches down pretty well now. It doesn't give us too<br/>much trouble. Even Usagi seems to have gotten the hang of it somewhat,<br/>she still screws up a lot though. Not nearly as much as when we first<br/>started though.<p>Tomorrow we go to an obstacle course. That sounds like it might be<br/>a little fun, even though I hate to admit it.<p>Ami and Nabiki have gotten very quiet, they don't talk much to<br/>anyone, more so for Nabiki than before. Ami seems distant now, but<br/>still friendly. I caught her giving Usagi an odd look the other day.<br/>I'm not sure what to make of it. Rei is handling this surprisingly<br/>well; she acts pretty much the same towards Usagi as she always has.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Makoto's Journal: Entry Four<p>Another week has gone by, I hate this place. I know I say that a<br/>lot, but it's tearing us apart. The stress is unbelievable, we're<br/>constantly under pressure to perform, and we never get the opportunity<br/>to have more than a few moments to ourselves. Even when we're just<br/>standing around, we have to do it quietly and uniformly. The worst<br/>part is, I'm growing to dislike Usagi. Even Ami feels that way, though<br/>she doesn't voice it. I realize that was what that look she was giving<br/>the girl meant after I saw it on a few of the other's faces. I'm<br/>really trying to fight these feelings, but...<p>Fuller has grown more sadistic with time. This morning he woke us<br/>up by rolling several canisters of gas into the billets. We had to<br/>struggle to get our masks and he laughed at us while we were doing it.<p>Ami doesn't voice much of anything really. She only speaks when she's<br/>spoken too anymore, it's frustrating. Nabiki is a bit more vocal, but<br/>she has to be. Fuller appointed her 'squad leader' meaning she's in<br/>charge of keeping us in line so to speak. She's become our<br/>spokesperson, we had to ask for feminine items the other day. That was<br/>embarrassing, Fuller doesn't seem to care about our moods though. Rei<br/>is really bad, Minako is going into withdrawal I think. She hasn't<br/>seen a boy in weeks. She's starting to give Fuller odd stares.<br/>Fortunately, Trunks seems to be a little young for her to stare at<br/>that way. It's very disturbing.<p>All we've really been doing is firing those rifles this week. We<br/>go out to the range for most of the day, and shoot up targets. Some of<br/>them jump up at us now, and we're learning about other weapons as<br/>well. The M-60, I didn't like the look in Rei's eyes when she saw that<br/>weapon. I think she was sexually aroused when he brought out the<br/>rocket launcher. This place is doing strange things to us, I'm afraid<br/>for us.<p>Nabiki seemed to go on some power trip after she became squad<br/>leader. She was always ordering us around. I didn't understand it at<br/>first, but when she was confronted by the group of us she said 'would<br/>you rather have me tell you to do these things, or have him find out<br/>they aren't done?' It made too much sense, we apologized for it and<br/>she seems to be doing a good job of keeping us out of trouble.<br/>Unfortunately, Usagi does just as good of a job of getting us into it.<p>I wasn't sure if I wanted to put this into the journal, seeing as<br/>it's something I don't really want to remember. We found out two days<br/>ago, that Trunks was not bluffing us. We learned about hand grenades,<br/>and went out to a range to toss a few around. There were large targets<br/>and dug in barricades for us to hide behind when they went off.<br/>Naturally, Rei got that look in her eyes a few times while we were<br/>there. It wasn't shaping up to be that bad of a day really, it was<br/>light on PT, and we seemed somewhat relaxed.<p>That is, until Minako blew off her arm and tore up her face when<br/>she dropped her grenade. We all panicked, Usagi cried a lot, we all<br/>did. Nabiki was the only one who didn't look too upset. She had a<br/>disturbing calm about her throughout the whole thing.<p>Trunks showed up in a truck and loaded her onto the back of it. He<br/>tried to calm us down, but we were too angry. He ignored us and drove<br/>off, Fuller wouldn't let us follow.<p>When we got back to the billets...she was sitting on her bunk as<br/>if nothing had happened to her. The look on her face was scary. She<br/>seemed almost white with fear. She was looking at her arm and flexing<br/>her fingers. We asked her what had happened, but she simply said that<br/>she had passed out just after arriving, and when she woke up, she was<br/>fine.<p>This place isn't natural; it scares me more and more each day.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Makoto's Journal: Entry five<p>Another week has gone by. I hate Usagi Tsukino, but that doesn't<br/>excuse what we did. I feel so horrible, but it was satisfying in a way<br/>I can't describe. I can't understand, how I could have enjoyed it.<p>She's quiet now, looking at us with that hurt and betrayed<br/>expression. I think it broke her, I don't know how I'm going to live<br/>with myself after seeing those eyes. I just...<p>Usagi screwed up one too many times. Her weapon was a mess for the<br/>inspection. It was dirty, and she had forgotten to put the firing pin<br/>back in. We just couldn't take any more.<p>That night, we all sneaked up on her in the middle of the night. We<br/>grabbed her sheets and beat her with soap that we had put into socks.<br/>Her cries of pain tore into my heart, but I didn't stop. I couldn't.<br/>This went on for a few minutes, but it seemed like an eternity. We all<br/>went back to bed. She didn't even get up; she just stayed there<br/>sobbing to herself. I didn't get any sleep that night, I know Minako<br/>and Rei didn't either. Ami and Nabiki did though, I don't see how<br/>though. I'm not sure how many times I cried that night, listening to<br/>Usagi apologize to us over and over. I don't think I'll ever forgive<br/>myself. She wasn't doing any of it deliberately, it was just. I can't<br/>even bring it to words. I just...oh god what have I done?<p>One of my best friends, and I can't even bring myself to think of her<br/>that way any more. She's just an annoyance now, the one thing keeping<br/>us from succeeding.<p>The next day, Usagi was gone. We didn't do anything; we just did a<br/>lot of PT, but no real training otherwise. She came back that night,<br/>her eyes never fixed on any of us. I'm not sure what happened to her.<br/>I think she was with Trunks and Hotaru all day, but she isn't talking.<br/>Most of the others are too disturbed by their own actions to speak<br/>with her.<p>Ami and Nabiki don't seem to care. I don't know what happened to<br/>Ami, she's so different now. She was always quiet, but she was never<br/>this cold. I liked her a lot; I'm not sure how much. Now, I can barely<br/>stand to look at her. We've all changed so much. I don't think it's<br/>for the better either.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Makoto's Journal: Entry Six<p>I haven't seen the billets in three days. We've been outside for a<br/>long time. Camping, Fuller calls it Bivouac. We sleep in tents, and<br/>spend the day running around in the strange environment. We seem to be<br/>in a forest, but I've never seen one while outside before. It's as if<br/>it popped up overnight. That doesn't surprise me, seeing as Trunks<br/>controls every aspect of this place. It rained all day yesterday, and<br/>it snowed most of the day today. We've got about four feet outside the<br/>tents now, and we're all miserable. Even Nabiki seems to show it. Ami<br/>seems oddly comfortable though, maybe because she's Sailor Mercury?<br/>Huh, I'd almost forgotten about that.<p>We call each other by our family names now, nowhere near the<br/>personal relationship we used to have. I'm not sure why, but it seems<br/>right with the situation. Fuller has always referred to us that way<br/>though. I wonder if we'll go back to the way we were once we leave? I<br/>doubt it. I don't think any of us will ever be the same.<p>Usagi screwed up as usual, she managed to tie her arms together<br/>during first aid training. Fuller seems to focus more on us as<br/>individuals now rather than as a group. Our fear of Usagi screwing up<br/>has lessened somewhat, but we still don't want to let her if we can<br/>help it. Fuller doesn't always focus on just her. When she screws up,<br/>sometimes he announces that we should 'Thank Tsukino' for whatever<br/>torture he's devised for us. We all screw up sometimes, and all of us<br/>have had a similar announcement made on our behalf. Usagi just has it<br/>happen a lot more, a whole lot more.<p>She's stopped crying at least, and seems to have more focus on<br/>what she's doing. She's trying harder than ever, and her slipups are<br/>lessening somewhat. Whatever Trunks told her, it definitely helped.<br/>She still doesn't speak too us about that, or anything if she doesn't<br/>have too. I can't bear to look her in the eyes, not out of disgust for<br/>what I did so much as I honestly don't like her. The others feel the<br/>same way, and none of them tries to hide it. It's like we've all had a<br/>big fight about something important. Maybe we did, but I don't see it.<br/>Her cheerfulness is gone, she's sullen most of the time, but doesn't<br/>look for forgiveness or try to make up with us. I'm not sure if she's<br/>expecting us to make up with her, or if she just doesn't care anymore.<br/>Maybe she doesn't like us either? I can't say I blame her.<p>Trunks seems to be around more often than normal. I've seen him<br/>talking to Usagi, he seems to be encouraging her. We all tried that<br/>before, but it didn't work. It's obvious he doesn't like doing it, I<br/>had to hold in a laugh when he walked by me muttering something about<br/>'becoming Tuxedo Dork'.<p>Fuller is more reserved now, if we do things on our own, he<br/>doesn't show up as much. He seems to leave us on our own as long as we<br/>aren't screwing around. That's a great relief to most of us, we strive<br/>to keep things in order just to keep him away whenever we can.<p>Eating is still an adventure. I found that out when Fuller passed<br/>out something called an MRE. Meal Ready to Eat or something like that.<br/>It was the most disgusting thing I've ever had. There was a little<br/>chocolate bar inside of it, but it tasted like chalk flavored wax. We<br/>all ate it though, going hungry isn't a good idea the way we move<br/>around. We march miles at a time, we run constantly, and we're always<br/>stopping for 'PT stops'. No one else gets the pun but me, not that<br/>it's funny or anything.<p>From the very beginning, we've had to eat meals in about five to<br/>ten minutes, depending on how well we've performed over the past few<br/>days. The better we did, the more time we have to eat.<p>We go out at night sometimes now. We've been to the rage a few<br/>times after dark, it's a lot different. Rei's weapon is always<br/>immaculate, I think she's gotten in a bit of trouble for keeping it<br/>that way rather than focusing on her uniform and boots. Fuller has to<br/>be able to see his face in our boot toes, that's not easy to do with<br/>as much wear and tear as the boots get. Life is getting into a sort of<br/>pattern now. It's getting easier to predict what's happening next, and<br/>a lot of our time is becoming routine. I find myself thinking that<br/>this place isn't so bad. I hate that thought.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Makoto's Journal: Entry Seven<p>It's been two weeks since I last wrote in this book. Looking back,<br/>I wish I had written more. Fuller says he'll be leaving soon, and that<br/>we should be proud of what we've accomplished. I don't know what to<br/>say to that. I've just got no clue.<p>All I know, is that Trunks has something else planned for us after<br/>this. I'd like to think the worst is over. Over the past few weeks,<br/>we've worked hard. Usagi earned Expert on her marksmanship oddly<br/>enough. She did the best out of all of us. Unfortunately, that's about<br/>all she can do well. Rei is a bit upset that the girl did better than<br/>her on the range.<p>We've done so much, I've been too busy to write, and too tired to<br/>even think at night. We repelled off the top of a tall tower, after<br/>climbing up to the top with nothing but our hands, feet, and a few<br/>protruding ledges in the side of the structure. We went through an<br/>obstacle course at night, with a machine gun firing over our heads.<br/>The pit is rarely visited any longer. Not that it bothers us much<br/>anymore.<p>I've learned so much over the past few weeks. I don't know how it<br/>will help us in the future, but I can't fault the man for being a bad<br/>teacher. We learned everything he had to teach us, whether we wanted<br/>too or not. I know we were changed forever by this. I wish I could<br/>just go back to the way I was before. I know that's not possible.<p>I feel a sense of pride for just having survived this. Fuller is<br/>an evil man. Well, he's not a man at all really, it's easy to forget.<br/>He's evil, but he's evil with a purpose, I find myself respecting him,<br/>despite the fact I know he doesn't even exist..."<p>"Actually, he does exist. Fuller was created from my own<br/>memories," said Trunks as he smiled at Makoto and looked at her after<br/>glancing over her shoulder at the page she was writing.<p>"Huh?" said the girl in surprise as she looked at him. "Sir!" she<br/>jumped to her feet and saluted him sharply. "I'm sorry sir! I didn't<br/>see you come in!"<p>"It's all right," replied the boy calmly as he returned the salute<br/>and shook his head.<p>"You knew a real Fuller?"<p>"It was a very long time ago, but yes I did. I never liked him,<br/>but I respected him an awful lot in the end." The boy smirked at her<br/>and looked around the room. "I wish I could give you all a graduation<br/>like the one I had. Your families would be quite proud."<p>The girls all looked at him in confusion.<p>"What?" said Nabiki.<p>"It's over, you've all passed," replied Trunks calmly as he walked<br/>into the middle of the room and looked around. "You've just completed<br/>Basic Combat Training. You're all real soldiers now."<p>Usagi turned to look at the others for a moment and smiled<br/>slightly weakly. "Congratulations then."<p>Everyone looked at her uncomfortably, even Nabiki was unnerved by<br/>the reaction. Ami frowned at the girl and shook her head slowly.<p>"What do you mean?" said Trunks as he looked at her. "You passed<br/>as well. You're a little rough still, but you meet all the<br/>requirements."<p>Usagi blinked at this and stared at him. "But...I'm not good<br/>enough, all I do is hold them back."<p>"I'm not going to argue with you Usagi. You may be an annoyance<br/>sometimes, but they will not succeed without you."<p>Everyone in the room stared at him as if he'd grown a second head.<p>"You've all still got a lot to learn, but don't worry. You'll<br/>learn very quickly. The real training is about to start, and I'm<br/>afraid it's nothing compared to what you have just done. All I did,<br/>was give you the knowledge to take the first step in the next part of<br/>your training."<p>"There's more?" wailed Minako.<p>"Great," grumbled Makoto irritably. "I take it we'll be seeing<br/>Fuller again tomorrow then?"<p>"No, Fuller has fulfilled his role. You're going to have to deal<br/>with this on your own. I'm afraid Fuller has been shut down." The boy<br/>blinked in surprise as Minako fell too her knees with tears in her<br/>eyes.<p>"Noooo! Fuller! The only real man in this place is gone!"<p>Ami had been standing next to her and moved away with an<br/>uncomfortable looking frown. "So, what will we be doing?" she asked<br/>gently.<p>"You're jumping straight into the field. You'll get the weekend<br/>off today, do what you want, rest, relax, and enjoy yourselves for a<br/>couple of days. On Monday, you'll start your first mission."<p>"Mission?" said Usagi as she cocked her eyebrow in confusion.<p>"That's right. Tendo, I'd like to speak with you," said the boy as<br/>he walked out of the room and outside.<p>The girl stood in front of him at attention and he looked her up<br/>and down. "Heh, you've done very well."<p>"Thank you sir," replied the girl emotionlessly. Trunks could tell<br/>she didn't like speaking too him at all.<p>"Well, I've decided to keep you on as the leader of this troupe.<br/>Congratulations Lieutenant." He handed her a small box with a single<br/>gold bar inside. She looked at him in surprise and muttered a quiet<br/>thanks.<p>"I doubt if you'll be very pleased with this in a few days time.<br/>You're responsible for them now, I'm giving you Fullers job. You just<br/>don't have to be as vicious about it as he was. They're completely<br/>under your control."<p>"What about you?" said the girl as she stared at him.<p>"I'll be giving orders to you, it's your job to make sure they get<br/>sent out," replied the boy calmly. "Minako is going to be your first<br/>Sargent, with Ami being directly under her as Sargent First Class."<p>"All right," replied the girl as she nodded once. "What will we be<br/>doing, if I might ask?"<p>Trunks smirked at her. "See that?" said the boy as he pointed at a<br/>building that had appeared on the horizon. Nabiki gasped as she<br/>realized that it was several buildings, making up a complex of some<br/>kind. "You're going to invade that building, with specific objectives<br/>that you need to complete. This is a live combat exercise. You saw<br/>what Happened to Minako on the grenade range, so you understand what<br/>I'm planning."<p>"What?" gasped the girl in shock as she stared at him.<p>"I'm telling you so you can be ready, you can tell the others if<br/>you like, or keep it to yourself until the time comes. Let them enjoy<br/>their time off so to speak. However, don't think for a moment that<br/>you're going to survive at first. There are hundreds of programs<br/>similar to Fuller running around that building. Most of them<br/>programmed to kill you all."<p>Nabiki was as white as a sheet, she stepped back away from the boy<br/>slightly and nodded her head once. "Why? Why are you doing this?"<p>"You'll understand when the time comes," replied the boy calmly.<br/>"For now, simply concentrate on relaxing, because in a few days,<br/>survival will be the only thing on your mind."<p>Nabiki nodded and turned away after giving the boy a sharp salute.<p>After she had returned to the inside of the building, Hotaru<br/>landed beside the boy. "That was definitely worth my time to watch."<p>"They've grown harder, stronger, now they'll learn to be ruthless<br/>and smarter."<p>"It should be amusing at any rate," said Hotaru with a small<br/>shrug. "Are you sure about Usagi though?"<p>"She'll go in with the others. Despite it all she did pass, if<br/>only barely."<p>"Your call," replied the girl with a small shrug. "How do you<br/>think she'll handle it?"<p>"That's up to her," replied Trunks with a small snort. "She has<br/>the strongest will. I think she'll do better than you think."<p>Hotaru nodded and glanced at the doorway to the billets. "Maybe<br/>you're right. They'll never be the same though."<p>"Heh, of course not," said Trunks as he waved his hand to dismiss<br/>the matter. "It'll be interesting if nothing else."<p>"Well, I think I'll definitely be entertained watching those girls<br/>get themselves killed."<p>"The fact that they don't stay that way, does make it more amusing<br/>doesn't it?" agreed Trunks. "Let them have their two days though.<br/>We've got plenty of time for that stuff later."<p>++++++++++++++<p>TBC...
