</div>Insertion<p>Part 11<p>The Senshi's Revenge<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome was walking home from his job at the Cat Cafe. He<br/>had changed back into a man again, escaping both Mousse and Shampoo in<br/>the process. It had been about two weeks since the incident on the<br/>beach, and Cologne was surprised when she showed up for work.<p>"Why are we keeping this job?" muttered Ranma irritably.<p>"Because it's good for us, it gets us away from the Tendo house,<br/>and it keeps us with an income," replied Carrot casually.<p>"Yeah, ammunition isn't cheap you know," agreed Dan.<p>"Oh," said Ranma glumly.<p>"So? Now what?" asked Carrot as he looked up at the sky and<br/>watched the stars as they walked.<p>"We've got a meeting," said Dan with a smirk.<p>"Is that tonight?" asked Carrot cheerfully. "I must have lost<br/>track of the days."<p>"Yup," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>++++++++++<p>It was a small bar in the Nerima area, a light haze of smoke<br/>filled the room, and several other patrons sat around the various<br/>booths. A group of three men in gray uniforms caught Ranma's eye and<br/>he walked over to them.<p>"Hi," he said casually as he took up a seat next to them.<p>"Genaku, how have you been?" asked Kunzite as he pat the boy on<br/>his back.<p>"Pretty good. I haven't had to deal with those crazy chicks in a<br/>while now."<p>"Good to hear. I only wish I was so lucky," said Jadeite with a<br/>frown as he downed a shot of some form of alcohol.<p>"Not doing so well?" said Zocite with a small chuckle.<p>"Hey. None of that now, you can back-stab each other when you're<br/>with the queen bitch," snorted Ranma as he nodded at the bartender.<p>The man looked at him and gave a small nod of recognition as he<br/>set down a bottle of beer in front of him.<p>"Beryl isn't the best person to work for, but it's not like we<br/>have a choice," said Kunzite with a small nod.<p>"How's Nephrite?" asked Ranma casually.<p>"Still strutting around like a peacock," commented Jadeite with<br/>his frown deepening a little. "He's still the smug bastard he's always<br/>been."<p>"Well, live and stay the same moron you always were," replied the<br/>boy with a small shrug. "Cheer up Jadeite."<p>"Heh. I suppose I should," commented the man as he glared at<br/>Kunzite and Zocite for a moment. "Beryl is growing impatient with me.<br/>That's not good."<p>"I suppose not," said Ranma with a small nod.<p>"I'm starting to see why you didn't want to join us," said Jadeite<br/>as he took another shot.<p>"Slow down," snorted Zocite. "We don't want to carry you back<br/>again."<p>Ranma found himself frowning, wishing he could do something for<br/>his old friend. He knew better than to convince them to join him.<br/>Beryl had a hold on their minds that he knew he couldn't break.<p>"This makes me think of better times," said Kunzite with a wistful<br/>looking grin. "Like that time we all got smashed in the place known as<br/>Italy now."<p>"Oh god. Don't remind me. Endimyon was pissed," grumbled Jadeite.<p>"Using a Galaxy Class Destroyer as our ride home probably didn't<br/>help matters either," commented Ranma with a slight grin.<p>"We shouldn't have ordered him to park it in front of the bar,"<br/>said Kunzite with a small chuckle.<p>"Poor Nephrite about wet himself when half the building was<br/>crushed," chuckled Ranma.<p>"Yeah," agreed Zocite as he gave a small laugh.<p>"We always gave him a hard time," commented Ranma. "He used to<br/>take it so well."<p>"Well, he never stayed mad at you long," said Jadeite with a small<br/>chuckle. "I think he may have had a little crush on you."<p>"Never thought about that," commented the boy with another shrug.<p>"Please, it never crossed your mind once?" chuckled Zocite.<p>"Naw. I've never been interested in stuff like that really,"<br/>replied Ranma obliviously.<p>"Well the incident on earth was nothing compared to that time<br/>Genaku went to Mercury with us," said Kunzite.<p>"Oy," muttered Ranma as he clutched his head. "Don't remind me."<p>"Thirteen years of genetic manipulation, ruined in one moment of<br/>blatant stupidity."<p>"Well, she looked thirsty," grumbled Ranma.<p>"She was supposed to be the Senshi of the Sun," commented Zocite.<br/>"Giving her a shot of 150 proof alcohol wasn't a good idea."<p>"She shot flames out of her mouth and into one of the vats of high<br/>explosives in the lab. The orbit of the planet was disrupted by the<br/>explosion," said Kunzite as he grabbed the boy by his shoulder. "I<br/>don't think I've ever seen Mercury that angry with anyone."<p>"Serenity put a stop to the project after that," grumbled Ranma<br/>irritably.<p>"Heh, she always liked you for some reason," commented Jadeite.<p>"I suppose. I never figured out why," said the boy with another<br/>shrug.<p>"You were the only fiancee that Pluto wasn't able to get rid of,"<br/>commented Zocite.<p>"That explains a lot," muttered Ranma.<p>"We were all a little different back then," said Kunzite with a<br/>small nod.<p>"Well, this is getting too depressing for me. I'll see you guys<br/>around," said Ranma as he stood up and stepped away from the bar.<p>"Back to the family again?" asked Zocite.<p>"You got it. It's been so long since I've had one," said the boy<br/>with a small nod.<p>"Heh. That goes for all of us. I'm almost envious," said Jadeite.<p>Ranma gave them a small wave and walked out into the street.<p>+++++++++++<p>"It's getting late," said Carrot as he looked up at the sky.<p>"Yeah. I can't wait to hit the sack," commented Dan.<p>"It's a nice night though," said Ranma as he glanced around at the<br/>empty streets. They were about halfway home now, and it was a cool<br/>evening.<p>Carrot was about to respond, when something interrupted him.<p>++++++++++<p>"Evil demon who holds no love for mankind! For the crime of<br/>hurting the Senshi of Time, there can be no forgiveness! We're the<br/>Sailor Senshi! In behalf of the moon, you shall be punished."<p>"Shit!" snapped Ranma as he spun around and found himself<br/>surrounded by the girls. There were five of them, and that accounted<br/>for all of them at the moment.<p>Sailor Moon stood proudly in her pose, and then dropped her hand.<br/>"This guy?"<p>"He's more dangerous than he looks," said Minako as she glared at<br/>him angrily. "He's got to be destroyed!"<p>"What? Why?" snapped Ranma as he continued to turn and assess his<br/>situation. There was no easy way to escape.<p>"You killed Sailor Pluto, and you ruined my hair!" snapped Minako.<p>"Pluto isn't dead!" snapped Ranma as he grit his teeth and stepped<br/>back away from her. "If you're still alive, I know I didn't kill her,<br/>Minako."<p>"He knows your name?" gasped Mercury in shock.<p>"And yours Ami," said the boy with a small chuckle. He leveled a<br/>glare at her and smiled. One of the voices in his head informed him<br/>that she was the weakest link in the circle.<p>Ranma slowly edged his way towards the shorthaired senshi, and<br/>reached behind his back. He muttered a small curse when he realized<br/>that his weapons were still at the Tendo home. "We're in trouble," he<br/>told himself.<p>"Who are you? How do you know who their names?" snapped Usagi.<p>Ranma turned his head towards her and smiled for a moment. It<br/>might be enough to throw them off balance enough for him to escape. "I<br/>know who all of you are. Makoto, Usagi, Rei, Ami, and Minako. Where<br/>are your little sidekicks? You know, Luna and Artemis?"<p>The girls gasped in shock, and began to move back. All of them had<br/>horrified looks on their faces.<p>"Now!" screamed Ranma as he jumped into the air and landed on top<br/>of a nearby street light. He bounced off of the pole, and sailed over<br/>the girls. Before they could recover, he was in a full sprint. He<br/>quickly left the sidewalk and moved into a wooded area inside a small<br/>park.<p>"No you don't!" cried Makoto. "Thunder Shower!"<p>Ranma was forced to roll across the ground as a bolt of lightening<br/>struck the ground in his path. His entire body tingled, and he cursed<br/>as he rose to his knees, only to find himself surrounded again.<br/>"Damn!"<p>"Good work Sailor Jupiter!" cried a male voice from above them.<br/>All of the girls looked up and saw Tuxedo Mask standing on a branch.<p>Ranma was standing in a combat stance, and glaring at the girls.<br/>"Get the hell out of my way! I ain't done nuthin to none of you!"<p>"That's a lie!" snapped Minako.<p>"You attacked me for no good reason!" retorted the boy angrily.<p>"What is he talking about?" said Usagi in confusion.<p>"Leave me alone!" snarled Ranma as a soft glow formed around his<br/>body.<p>"Look out!" cried Makoto.<p>"Don't make me hurt you!" snarled Ranma.<p>Ami raised her hands, and a dense cold fog began to form in the<br/>air.<p>Ranma jumped above it, and was met in the air by Tuxedo Mask. He<br/>managed to get a kick in and forced him back into the ring of girls.<p>"Sailor Moon! Defeat him now!"<p>"Endimyon! You bastard!" snarled the martial artist. "Kaio Ken!"<p>The tuxedo clad man gasped in surprise as the angry boy appeared<br/>in front of him and slammed his fist into his face. He was thrown into<br/>the air by the force of the blow, he landed rather painfully as Ranma<br/>appeared in the air above him and kicked him into the ground.<p>"No! Tuxedo Mask!" cried Usagi.<p>"Mars Fire Arrow!" cried Rei as she shot a bolt of flames at the<br/>pigtailed boy, only to have him vanish from in front of the<br/>projectile. "No! Ami! Look out!"<p>The Senshi of Mercury gasped as the flames sped towards her, she<br/>was barely able to erect her shield in time and they bounced away.<p>"Thunder Shower!" cried Makoto angrily, her attack was never<br/>finished, as the boy kicked at her and stopped the energy from leaving<br/>her body. She managed to block the strike and snorted. "You'll have to<br/>do better than that!"<p>"I'm barely trying now!" snarled Ranma as he appeared opposite<br/>Sailor Moon. "I'm warning you."<p>Tuxedo Mask grabbed his leg. Ranma turned to glance at him in<br/>surprise. "Do it Sailor Moon! I've got him!"<p>The boy jumped up and kicked his leg out, throwing the unfortunate<br/>man into Usagi. They both tumbled to the ground and he vanished as<br/>another bolt of fire and lightening slammed into the ground where he<br/>had been.<p>"He's too fast!" snapped Makoto. She charged forward and met him as he<br/>appeared again. Lashing out with a kick that the boy barely dodged.<p>"Damn it!" he growled as he rolled away as Rei got into the act as<br/>well.<p>"I'll purify your soul with my sacred fire!" screamed the<br/>priestess as she attempted too kick him.<p>"Ha! Kaio Ken, times two!" snapped Ranma.<p>"No way!" gasped Makoto as she felt a super strong blow in her<br/>gut. She sailed through the air, only to impact on the boy's waiting<br/>knee as he appeared behind her.<p>Rei didn't even have time to blink after that assault as the boy<br/>vanished and appeared with his fist in her jaw. She crumpled too the<br/>ground and didn't move.<p>Makoto staggered too her feet and glared at him. "That hurt!"<p>"Oh like hitting me with a lightening bolt wouldn't hurt me!"<br/>snapped the boy angrily as he appeared and kneed her in the face. She<br/>was thrown onto her back and passed out.<p>Minako had been running back and fourth, trying to get an attack<br/>in up to this point. She could barely follow his movements though,<br/>much less keep up. Now, with her two friends knocked out, she finally<br/>saw an opportunity for a clean shot. "Venus Crescent Beam!"<p>Ranma ducked as the arc of energy sailed over his head. It slammed<br/>into a tree behind him, and he rolled out of the way.<p>Minako only looked on in horror as the gigantic trunk slowly fell<br/>towards her. "Uh oh."<p>"Look out!" cried Tsuki as she appeared and shoved her out of the<br/>way.<p>"Tsuki!" gasped the girl in shock as she looked down at her<br/>savior. She frowned as she noticed the dazed look on her face; the<br/>girl had hit her head on a rock and was now out cold. "Rei is right!<br/>You are a klutz!" She blinked and looked up, only to find Ranma<br/>cracking his knuckles and glaring at her. "Oh man."<p>He kicked her in the face, and she was out as well. That was when<br/>he realized that he had forgotten about someone. "No! Where's..."<p>"Moon Twilight Flash!" cried Sailor Moon as she focused a beam of<br/>energy from the moon onto him.<p>"Argh!" he cried in pain as the light blinded him.<p>Tuxedo Mask jumped up and tossed a rose at him from where he was<br/>still lying on the ground. He gasped in shock as the boy caught it<br/>while still blinded by the light. The boy tossed it away and fell to<br/>his knees.<p>"Ouch! What the hell was that?" sputtered Ranma as he rubbed at<br/>his eyes and tried to focus his sight.<p>"No way!" gasped Usagi in shock.<p>He stood up and glared at the pair for a moment. "Leave me the<br/>hell alone!" With that said, the glow formed around his body, and he<br/>vanished from sight completely.<p>Ami staggered over to the fallen senshi in shock. "I'm sorry! I<br/>couldn't do anything!"<p>"You did real good Ami! You were as brave as they were!" said<br/>Usagi in her defense.<p>"Thanks, but I wish I could do more than just make fog," muttered<br/>the girl with a small frown.<p>"Sailor Moon, are you hurt?" asked Tuxedo Mask with a worried<br/>frown.<p>"We should be fine, our pride is a little bruised though. We won't<br/>underestimate him next time. I wish I had listened to Minako sooner."<p>He smiled and nodded at her. "I understand."<p>++++++++++++<p>"Damn it!" grumbled Carrot angrily as they moved towards the Tendo<br/>home in the shadows. "I thought we were through with that!"<p>"Well, apparently not," snorted Dan irritably.<p>"They'll think twice before attacking us again," said Carrot with<br/>a small sigh.<p>"We kicked their asses," agreed Ranma with an angry frown.<p>"Yeah, but that attack hurt. We still can't see straight,"<br/>muttered Dan irritably.<p>"Great, It's starting to come back at least," said Carrot as he<br/>made them blink. "We need to start packing when we're at work now it<br/>seems."<p>"I've got no problem with that," said Dan.<p>"Of course you wouldn't!" snapped Ranma. "I don't need no stupid<br/>guns!"<p>"You say that now, but it would have been easier to escape if we<br/>had them with us."<p>"Look, can we not talk about this?" said Carrot with a frown.<p>"Heck no!" snapped Ranma as he punched himself in the jaw.<p>"Ouch! You bastard!" retorted Dan as he countered with a slug to<br/>his own stomach.<p>"That hurts you jerks!" snapped Carrot as he gave himself a right<br/>hook.<p>Within moments, the trio was rolling on the ground in combat with<br/>themselves.<p>Carrot was about to knee himself in the chest, when something<br/>unusual happened.<p>"Stop it this instant! Fighting is bad!"<p>Ranma froze where he was on the ground and blinked.<p>"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?" cried Carrot.<p>"You don't have to be so mean! We could talk about this like<br/>gentlemen? There's no need to be violent!"<p>"Who said that?" muttered Ranma in horror.<p>"Oh god no," grumbled Dan.<p>"Hi! I can't let you do that anymore. It isn't right, and I'm sure<br/>we can all make up and be friends!"<p>The voice was...cute. Irritatingly so, and it was almost feminine<br/>sounding, but not quite.<p>"Who the hell are you?" snapped Carrot angrily.<p>"I'm your new conscience. Your old one wasn't working, so the<br/>power of the moon made me to help you! Isn't that nice?"<p>"!"<p>The pained cry echoed through the streets of Nerima for another<br/>hour.<p>++++++++++++<p>A familiar figure stood glaring up at the stars from the rocky<br/>surface of some unknown world. His bangs hung around his face, and a<br/>small 'R' could be seen peeking out from behind them. He was dressed<br/>in a black suit and tie, with shined black shoes and a bowl hat<br/>resting on top of his head.<p>"Where the hell am I now?" he cried into the sky angrily. He<br/>raised his fists into the air, and the stones around him began to rise<br/>off of the ground from the power he was exerting. "Damn you Ranma!<br/>When I finally return home again. I'll show you the true terror of Mr.<br/>Where!" He paused as a small watch alarm went off. "And I'll find you,<br/>right after I have tea."<p>Ryoga set down his backpack, and opened it, pulling out a small<br/>tea set from inside. He promptly went about setting it up, and<br/>preparing a few small sandwiches and cookies for himself.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Ranma was staggering down the sidewalk, a horrified stare on his<br/>face as he moved towards the Tendo Dojo. "Another one..." He muttered<br/>the phrase over and over.<p>Dan punched them again. "Snap out of it!"<p>"I said stop that!" said the voice angrily.<p>"The hell! Make me you little wimp!" snorted Dan angrily. He<br/>gasped as he found himself unable to move.<p>"No one can resist it! You'll just have to learn to stop being so<br/>violent.<p>Carrot snorted, and punched himself again.<p>"Stop that!" cried the voice. Carrot found himself immobile and<br/>Dan slugged himself.<p>"Ouch! That hurts! Stop hurting me!" whined the voice<br/>pathetically.<p>Ranma decided to take a shot, and slugged himself as well. Then he<br/>found himself immobile as the weird voice tried to stop him.<p>Carrot and Dan both slugged themselves again.<p>"Why? Why are you being so mean?" cried the voice pathetically.<p>"Heh. It seems that it can only suppress one of us at a time,"<br/>chuckled Carrot.<p>"Like that's a big help," snorted Ranma.<p>"We'll just keep kicking its ass until it leaves us alone,"<br/>snorted Dan.<p>"I'll never give up! Giving up is something we should never..."<p>All three of them attacked at the same time, laying themselves out<br/>across the pavement.<p>After a moment, Dan groaned painfully. "Is it gone? Did we kill<br/>it?"<p>Carrot sighed and shook their head. "I think it's just knocked<br/>out."<p>"I really hate you guys," muttered Ranma.<p>"Right, well I hate you guys too," snorted Carrot in irritation.<br/>"Let's just go home. I'm tired."<p>There was a resounding agreement at that, and they stood up and<br/>began to walk home again in silence.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Ouch," muttered Tsuki as she sat down in her room on Pluto. She<br/>was rubbing the spot on her head where she had been hit. "This job<br/>sucks." She frowned and looked into the Time Gate, it was currently<br/>showing the present, and all the Senshi, and one Tuxedo clad guardian<br/>were covered in bruises and scrapes far worse than her own.<p>She sighed and tried to relax.<p>Inside her healing tank nearby, Setsuna shook her head and sighed.<br/>The girl was definitely trying her best, but still. She needed to be<br/>out there again. Things were going too far out of control for Tsuki to<br/>handle, and it would only grow worse. Especially with Genaku around.<p>The young girl stood up from her seat and turned to look at<br/>Setsuna in adoration. "Don't worry. I'll take care of this until<br/>you're better."<p>The woman nodded, and closed her eyes.<p>"I guess I should practice now," grumbled Tsuki. "I am Senshi in<br/>training Tsuki! And you shall be punished for... No, too long. I need<br/>something more decisive! I am Tsuki! Senshi in Training! On behalf of<br/>Pluto, you shall be punished!" She hung her head and frowned. "No,<br/>that's Usagi's line." She stopped and looked thoughtful for a moment.<br/>"I've got it! Tsuki! Senshi of Time in training! And your time is up<br/>villain!" She looked pleased with herself and smiled cheerfully. "Now,<br/>If I could just come up with a good pose..."<p>If Setsuna could groan inside the healing liquid, she would have.<br/>She settled for merely banging her head lightly against the glass tube<br/>in frustration. "Idiot," she thought to herself.<p>+++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>
