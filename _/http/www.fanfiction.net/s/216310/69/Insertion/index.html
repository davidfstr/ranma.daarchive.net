</div>Insertion<p>Part 69<p>Vahn's Revenge Part 2<p>+++++++++++<p>Yohiko Hibiki smirked as she looked at Coach<br/>Mitaka. He was worn and tired. "So, how are you<br/>enjoying your job so far?" They were both standing<br/>in the schoolyard after classes had ended for the<br/>day with most of the students long gone.<p>"How can you stand it here?" he grumbled<br/>irritably.<p>"Easy, I'm the biggest fish in this little<br/>pond," she replied calmly.<p>Mitaka nodded and sighed. "Right."<p>"How are your studies coming?" she asked him<br/>calmly.<p>"I've improved a lot since that trip," he said<br/>with a smirk. "I imagine you wouldn't even break a<br/>sweat though."<p>"That's good," she responded with a nod. "How<br/>about it then?"<p>Mitaka blinked. "You're not going to hurt me<br/>are you?"<p>"As much as I'd enjoy that, I think I can go<br/>easy on you," replied the woman calmly.<p>Mitaka nodded and moved into a combat stance.<p>Yohiko smirked; his defense was actually<br/>pretty solid. "Not bad," she commented.<p>"Thanks," he said nervously.<p>"Come on then, attack me," she said with a<br/>small sigh.<p>"Right," replied the man as he rushed forward.<p>Yohiko dodged around him easily, his speed was<br/>good, but he was still little more than an<br/>educated idiot as far as she was concerned. "Well,<br/>you have improved haven't you?"<p>The man stopped his attack and backed away,<br/>panting for breath. "Yeah. I think so anyway, I'm<br/>still not ready for your class though."<p>"I'd give you a year or so," she replied with<br/>a shrug. "Yusaku would wipe the floor with you.<br/>You need to build speed more than anything else.<br/>Your technique is surprisingly good for as long as<br/>you've been at this."<p>"Well, I have been taking classes since I was<br/>little," grumbled the man. "I'd like to think that<br/>counts for something."<p>"You had a good teacher then," said the woman<br/>with a smirk on her face.<p>"Most people don't take this as seriously as<br/>you do," he said with a small snort.<p>"Well, most people don't need to," she replied<br/>with a shrug.<p>"Yeah, I figured that," muttered the man.<br/>"Fighting off the boy's classes, and escaping<br/>those perverted girls probably helps."<p>"Ha!" said the woman in genuine amusement.<p>"What?" said the man with a hurt look forming<br/>on his face.<p>"Nothing, your method of training is similar<br/>to someone I know. He does it intentionally<br/>though."<p>"Intentionally?" muttered Mitaka dumbly.<p>"Yes, his name is Happosai," said the woman<br/>cheerfully. "You probably wouldn't like him much."<p>The man shook his head. "I'm finally able to<br/>at least hold a class now."<p>"Yes, I'd noticed. You haven't been getting<br/>chased around the campus much these days," she<br/>said with a smirk on her face. "You'll get this if<br/>you keep up. Maybe even before the year is up if<br/>you keep working at it."<p>"Right," said the man. "Are you doing anything<br/>tonight?"<p>"Now Mitaka, you know you don't stand a<br/>chance. Just give up and find another woman. There<br/>are plenty of women more willing than I am."<p>The man sighed. "I don't want another woman."<p>"Yes, I know. I'm out of reach though," she<br/>replied with a shrug. "I'm past pining for my<br/>husband, and I'm enjoying myself as things are<br/>now. I don't want a man in my life."<p>A man walked up to the pair with a smirk on<br/>his face. "Oh? What am I then? Chopped liver?" He<br/>had a long pigtail going down his back all the way<br/>to his waist, and was dressed in silk Chinese<br/>clothing.<p>"Huh?" said Mitaka.<p>"Mitaka, this is Carrot," said Yohiko with a<br/>frown forming on her face. "He's...an old training<br/>partner of mine."<p>"Hiya. I'm Yohiko's lover," said the man<br/>cheerfully as he politely bowed to the man. "You<br/>must be Mitaka."<p>The poor man about choked where he stood.<p>"You are not my lover!" screamed Yohiko<br/>angrily.<p>"What would you call it then? Fuck buddy?"<br/>replied the man with his smirk remaining strong.<p>"You bastard!" she snarled as she stepped back<br/>into a combat stance.<p>Carrot merely smiled at her and looked at<br/>Mitaka. "Good luck, I'd be happy if you managed to<br/>take her off my hands."<p>"What?" cried the man in shock.<p>"I'll kill you!" screamed Yohiko.<p>"Maybe later, in private," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully. "You seen Dan around today?"<p>Yohiko relaxed slightly and growled. "No. Not<br/>since you two left." The group had separated at<br/>the end of the last lunch period about two hours<br/>earlier.<p>"Hmmm. I hope he's not getting drunk again,"<br/>commented Carrot with a shrug.<p>"Dan?" said Mitaka in confusion.<p>"He trained with us too," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Oh," said the man as he found himself<br/>becoming more and more confused. "He's lying,<br/>right Miss Yohiko?"<p>"Not really," said Carrot lazily. "We don't<br/>get along very well, but we just can't seem to<br/>help ourselves. It's weird really."-<p>Mitaka was white as a sheet, and Yohiko was<br/>turning red with anger.<p>"We can fight about it later, I'll see ya,"<br/>said Carrot as he turned away and started walking<br/>towards the gates.<p>"That bastard!" snarled Yohiko.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Ah, Carrot," said Cologne as her former son<br/>in law's doppelganger walked into the restaurant<br/>and sat down at one of the tables.<p>"Hiya," said the boy cheerfully.<p>"What brings you to this place?" said the old<br/>woman.<p>"I've been using that new technique to hang<br/>around town while I'm teaching classes."<p>Cologne nodded at this and sighed. "I see.<br/>It's a shame it's not more permanent."<p>"Not really, I'd probably end up killing most<br/>of the Amazon tribe in the end," he said with a<br/>thoughtful frown.<p>Cologne coughed in surprise. "I think you<br/>overestimate yourself."<p>"Naw, you'd get me in the end I think, but I'd<br/>take a whole bunch of you down with me. Not<br/>economical really."<p>"It's a moot point, but I fail to see how<br/>you'd survive against three thousand years of<br/>Amazon techniques."<p>"With two thousand year old martial arts<br/>counters of course," said the boy cheerfully.<p>Cologne almost sprayed her tea across the<br/>table, but managed to control herself. "Pardon?"<p>"I've been studying up," he replied with a<br/>shrug. "The old Musk techniques would be useful,<br/>as well as a few of the techniques of that old<br/>monastery that used to be around your area about<br/>fifteen hundred years or so ago. They had all<br/>sorts of counters, as I recall, you got the<br/>Hiryuushotenha from them. They had a counter for<br/>it; I've almost got it. I learned how to defeat<br/>the Splitting Cat Hair's technique about two weeks<br/>ago."<p>Cologne's eyes about bugged out of her head.<br/>"Where did you learn about that?"<p>"It's a secret," replied the boy cheerfully.<br/>The Mercury computer they had was very useful to<br/>them. It couldn't predict the future, or alter<br/>reality, but its information database was<br/>flawless.<p>"The counter techniques for the Hiryuushotenha<br/>and the Splitting Cat Hair's techniques were<br/>destroyed with that hellish place. We burned it to<br/>the ground, along with everything and everyone<br/>inside it!"<p>"Yeah, a real shame," said Carrot lazily.<p>Cologne simply sat where she was and mulled<br/>over this revelation. "There's no way! It's<br/>impossible for any of those techniques to have<br/>survived that inferno."<p>"Don't look at me. It's not my fault your<br/>elders were so hateful in your world."<p>Cologne seemed to relax suddenly. "So that's<br/>it! In his world, they must have survived, or the<br/>Amazons didn't destroy that knowledge. A pity."<br/>She looked up at him as her thoughts ended. "Yes,<br/>my ancestors were foolish in that regard."<p>"Haven't changed that much," he replied with a<br/>snort. "Three thousand years of staying the same<br/>ain't healthy ya know."<p>"We have survived this long because of it!"<br/>she snapped.<p>"Naw, you survived this long because you're<br/>living in the mountains, it was too much trouble<br/>to be rid of you. Sending an army up there would<br/>have been difficult until recently. If the Red<br/>Army decided to get rid of you..."<p>Cologne snorted at this. "Preposterous!"<p>"Yeah, don't go getting all belligerent on<br/>me," said the boy casually. "I think you're smart<br/>enough to realize what a battalion of tanks and<br/>soldiers would do to your little paradise, to say<br/>nothing of the Chinese Air Force that would<br/>precede them."<p>Cologne merely sat in her chair, shaking.<br/>Carrot couldn't tell if it was anger or simply<br/>fear of the idea he'd just placed in her head.<br/>"I'm sure your political contacts and herbal<br/>medicine have been able to keep yourself beneath<br/>notice though. As long as you're useful, you've<br/>got nothing to fear."<p>Cologne's head snapped up at him and her eyes<br/>narrowed. "How would he know about that?"<p>"Don't look at me that way. I'm not your brain<br/>dead son in law. I've learned a lot over the<br/>years," he replied calmly. "It's the same way you<br/>avoided notice where I'm from. The higher offices<br/>of the Chinese Government benefit from your<br/>counters to poisons, cures for rare diseases, and<br/>assorted magic. To say nothing of the use of some<br/>of the poisons that are only available to you in<br/>your area."<p>Cologne sighed and shook her head; she was<br/>actually chuckling with laughter. "You never cease<br/>to amaze me boy. It's a shame you weren't born a<br/>woman."<p>"Who says I wasn't?" retorted the boy calmly.<p>Cologne's head snapped up again.<p>Carrot chuckled as he decided to put the<br/>finishing touch on his little game of psyche out.<br/>"The dreaded training ground of Jusenkyo Hot<br/>Springs. Each pool cursed with a tragic legend."<br/>Ranma started screaming obscenities inside their<br/>head at this announcement.<p>"What?" muttered Cologne.<p>"Well, I did tell you I wasn't from this<br/>world," he replied with a shrug. "You don't think<br/>a boy would be as smart as I am do you?" He<br/>shifted to his older female form and grinned at<br/>her.<p>Cologne gasped, everything made sense now.<p>"But..."<p>"I have a daughter Cologne, I'm her mother,"<br/>said the woman as her eyes sparkled with<br/>amusement. "My name is Yohiko Hibiki, you don't<br/>think my parents would name me Ranma if I was born<br/>a woman do you?"<p>"This is..." stammered the woman in shock.<p>"I've been watching this place for a while,<br/>ever since I was sent to this world. I've been<br/>here for a while ya know. I even got married, my<br/>husband died about seven years ago."<p>Cologne simply stared at her, unable to speak<br/>or move. Everything was starting to make sense<br/>now.<p>"I've always been fascinated by Ranma Saotome.<br/>What I would have been had I been born a man."<p>"So, you were sent here from another world,<br/>into the past," said the old woman as she nodded<br/>her head. Things were starting to make sense.<p>"Something like that," agreed the woman<br/>casually. This was probably the greatest session<br/>of bullshitting she'd ever done. It was immensely<br/>satisfying.<p>Cologne frowned. "That would explain your<br/>reluctance to allow my Shampoo to chase you, and<br/>your attitude about fighting off these girls. The<br/>male Ranma would never do such a thing without a<br/>good reason."<p>"You're catching on," said the woman as her<br/>face contorted into anger for a moment. It quickly<br/>shifted back to a pleasant smile before Cologne<br/>noticed.<p>"I see," replied the old woman as she nodded<br/>her head and sighed. "A daughter?"<p>"Yes," said the woman cheerfully. "Her name is<br/>Usagi Hibiki, by a strange coincidence, I am Ryoga<br/>Hibiki's aunt in this world. I had no idea Keiichi<br/>was related to them."<p>Cologne jolted from this mild shock, shaken<br/>already by the previous revelations.<p>Yohiko looked down at her hand and smirked.<br/>"Looks like my time is up. Later old lady."<p>Cologne merely stared as the woman started to<br/>fade away. "Wait! I..." She sighed as the woman<br/>vanished completely. "This changes everything. I<br/>can't have Shampoo chasing her around anymore. The<br/>council would pitch a fit if they found out about<br/>that." She mulled over her problem for a moment<br/>and sighed. "Oh dear. I suppose it's time to tell<br/>her."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Within a minute, they were all back together<br/>in the apartment.<p>"So, now what?" asked Carrot lazily.<p>"Time for afternoon class," said Xianfu<br/>irritably. "You and I are gonna have a little talk<br/>later."<p>"Yeah, yeah, whatever," replied Ranma with an<br/>angry snort. "We got some stuff to tell ya about.<br/>Carrot's being an asshole again."<p>"Heh. I'm sorry, I couldn't resist! Admit it,<br/>the look on her face was worth it!" replied the<br/>voice cheerfully.<p>Ranma tried to be angry, he really did.<br/>Finally he sighed. "As much as I hate to admit it.<br/>It was kinda funny."<p>"That's the spirit!" said Carrot.<p>"What the hell have you done now?" snarled<br/>Dan.<p>"I know this is gonna bite us all in the ass,"<br/>snapped Xianfu.<p>"Probably, but we can deal with it. It's only<br/>the Amazons," said Carrot.<p>"Oh, that's okay then," replied Dan with a<br/>shrug.<p>"Right," agreed Pissant. "It wasn't mean was<br/>it?" he asked hopefully.<p>"Not really," said Ranma. "Well, at least not<br/>for Carrot."<p>"Oh, well then," replied Xianfu.<p>"Anyway, let's go get our lazy students," said<br/>Carrot cheerfully.<p>Ranma growled slightly as they walked out into<br/>the hall and moved towards Yusaku's door.<p>They opened it and smirked at the scene<br/>inside. "Well, hello."<p>Everyone froze and stared at the woman for a<br/>moment.<p>Yusaku was halfway through the act of putting<br/>a beer to his lips. Usagi was beside him talking<br/>with Akemi, and the rest of the residents were in<br/>the process of getting rather drunk.<p>"Um. Miss Yohiko..." said Yusaku dumbly. "I<br/>didn't think you'd join us..."<p>"That's Sensei, Godai, get dressed, I feel<br/>like a workout," she replied calmly as she turned<br/>away.<p>Usagi and the boy looked at each other with a<br/>frown forming on their faces. "Again?" grumbled<br/>Usagi. "We already did that today!"<p>"Do you really want her to come get us?" said<br/>Yusaku.<p>"Right," grumbled the girl as she stood up and<br/>walked out of the apartment.<p>"Everyone out, I gotta get changed," said<br/>Yusaku as he glared at the drunks for a moment.<p>"Hey. I ain't goin nowhere," said Akemi with a<br/>sultry looking grin.<p>"Me too! Me too!" agreed Itchinose.<p>"Out!" cried Yusaku as he shoved both women<br/>out the door.<p>Yotsuya quietly slid back through his hole in<br/>the wall and left the boy to change.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Why are we doing this right now?" grumbled<br/>Usagi.<p>"Silence!" snapped her mother. They were<br/>standing in the middle of the abandoned lot they<br/>used for practice. "Yusaku! One hundred Bakusai<br/>Tenketsu! Get started!"<p>"Right," muttered the boy as he walked over to<br/>a large pile of rocks that he and Usagi regularly<br/>lugged to the site during their normal training<br/>hours.<p>"As for you," said Yohiko as she stared at her<br/>daughter. "You're going to keep practicing the<br/>Katsutenshin Amaguriken for the rest of the day. I<br/>won't have you two slacking off!<br/>Bwahahahahahahaaa!"<p>A moment later, Cologne pogoed over the wall<br/>just in time to see Yohiko laughing. She paused<br/>for a moment and noticed what the girl's students<br/>were doing. "Well, it seems I've caught you in the<br/>middle of a lesson."<p>"Huh?" said the woman as she blinked and<br/>turned towards the hag. "Oh, yes. My lazy students<br/>aren't working hard enough lately, so I'm giving<br/>an extra lesson today! Bwahahahahaaa!"<p>"Is she always like this?" asked Cologne as<br/>she turned to the young girl.<p>"No, she's usually much worse," grumbled the<br/>child as she rubbed at the burns forming on her<br/>hands.<p>"Yes, I thought she was taking it awfully easy<br/>on you," said the crone with a shrug of her<br/>shoulders. "You must be Usagi."<p>"Huh? Do I know you?" said the girl in<br/>surprise.<p>"This is Cologne, she's an old friend of<br/>mine," said Yohiko.<p>"Ha! Old is right!" said Usagi cheerfully.<p>Cologne promptly whacked her on her head with<br/>her staff. "Faster! You'll never master that<br/>technique if you're slacking off and talking to<br/>me!"<p>Usagi sniffled with a tear in her eye and<br/>turned back to the small fire she had just<br/>started.<p>"What brings you here?" said Yohiko calmly.<p>"Not much, just checking up on the chi<br/>signature I felt. I thought it was you, but these<br/>two others had me wondering."<p>"Ah, not much to worry about," said Yohiko<br/>calmly.<p>"Yes, I can sense they are both mere<br/>beginners," agreed Cologne.<p>"About half a year, they've come along rather<br/>well. I thought it would take at least two years<br/>before I could start these techniques with them."<p>"Six months?" muttered Cologne in wonder.<br/>"You're joking?"<p>"Huh? Not really, it's been a little more than<br/>that, almost eight months really."<p>"And they are already up to this level?" said<br/>Cologne as she turned to look at the pair. "Most<br/>impressive young lady."<p>"Really? I didn't think so, they're both<br/>slackers," snorted Yohiko calmly. "I have to keep<br/>them both on their toes all the time. They keep<br/>trying to get out of training. Yusaku's not so<br/>bad, on account of he's still trying to get into<br/>my pants."<p>The boy paused his exercise for a moment, only<br/>to receive a thwack on his head from Cologne. The<br/>old woman didn't even look at him, or stop her<br/>conversation with Yohiko. He grumbled and started<br/>again.<p>"It's a good motivator," replied Cologne.<p>"Yeah, I've been trying to beat him out of it,<br/>or wear him down. He's stubborn though," replied<br/>Yohiko.<p>"Well, I'll leave you to your students then,"<br/>said Cologne cheerfully. As she hopped away, her<br/>mind worked diligently. "A woman like that, could<br/>be useful. If she was able to teach her students<br/>to be so strong in such a short time! Plus her<br/>teaching degree in academics? This is a prize I<br/>cannot pass up!" She smirked as she put the small<br/>camera she had hidden in her palm into her robes.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"What is this?" snorted Tanaka as he glared at<br/>the paper in his hand.<p>"Your next assignment," replied the man in a<br/>dark suit that stood in front of him.<p>"A brothel?" snorted the man irritably.<p>"Yes," said the man calmly. "We have reports<br/>of a drug lab being run inside this operation."<p>"Again?" said Tanaka irritably. "The last time<br/>we had a suspected report of this kind of<br/>thing..."<p>"You understand then," said the man with a<br/>small chuckle.<p>"Oh, I see. You think he's going to show up<br/>again," said Tanaka calmly.<p>"Yes, go there, eliminate the one who is doing<br/>this without our consent, and take over the<br/>operation. Don't shut it down."<p>"Vahn will be pleased to hear this, he's<br/>growing impatient," said Tanaka calmly. "I'll be<br/>take care of this right away."<p>"Excellent."<p>++++++++++++++<p>A small moving truck backed into the back of<br/>the large mansion. It was unmarked and the estate<br/>was on a rather large lot. It was a high-class<br/>brothel frequented by some of the most powerful<br/>men in Japan. The Oyabun would not be pleased that<br/>a drug lab tainted this operation at all. In fact,<br/>the order probably came from him. It was very<br/>unusual for someone as high ranked as the person<br/>running the operation to become greedy and do<br/>something so stupid. He probably thought he could<br/>get away with it because he was so high.<p>Tanaka snorted as he jumped out of the<br/>passenger seat of the truck and glanced around. He<br/>turned towards the well-built man who was driving.<br/>The man was wearing overalls and a mover's<br/>uniform. "Let him out, send him into the basement.<br/>Tanaka pointed at the large pair of doors that<br/>lead into the basement.<p>The back of the truck was opened, revealing a<br/>pair of red glowing eyes deep in the blackness of<br/>the rear.<p>"Go in, don't kill too many people, and try<br/>not to damage anything. This place is our bait."<p>"As you wish," replied the mechanical voice.<br/>There was a whirring sound as the thing stood up<br/>and began to climb towards the door. "At last, the<br/>time for my revenge grows near."<p>Tanaka smirked to himself as he turned away<br/>and started walking towards the front of the<br/>building. "I might enjoy staying here for a time."<p>++++++++++++<p>That night, Usagi Hibiki stood on the rooftops<br/>of Tokyo with a frown on her face. She was in the<br/>guise of Sailor Moon, and had yet to find anything<br/>of interest. "Man, this is boring."<p>Xellos appeared before her and grinned.<br/>"That's a good thing. It means you're doing a good<br/>job."<p>"Jadeite is still out there, I know he's<br/>plotting something," replied the girl sourly.<br/>"I'll be happy when I get him."<p>"I'm sure you will," replied the man calmly.<p>Usagi paused, she was on the outskirts of<br/>town, and noticed something unusual.<p>Several men in suits, surrounding an old man.<br/>They led him to a limousine and climbed in around<br/>him.<p>"What's a guy like that doing in a place like<br/>this?" muttered the girl in confusion. She wasn't<br/>in the best neighborhood in Tokyo. It was a run<br/>down looking place really, graffiti cluttered the<br/>walls, and trash was thrown carelessly on the<br/>streets. The whole place looked rather grimy and<br/>gray.<p>"Probably a Yakuza," said Xellos as he noted<br/>the quiet display. "Nothing for us to worry<br/>about."<p>"Yakuza are criminals," replied Usagi.<p>"Yes, very powerful ones at that," agreed<br/>Xellos. "He's not doing anything wrong. He<br/>probably owns a lot of the property around here.<br/>Just let it be."<p>Usagi frowned at this and snorted. "There's<br/>nothing else of interest around here. I'm gonna<br/>follow him."<p>"I don't recommend it," warned Xellos.<p>"Screw it, I'm bored," she responded as she<br/>jumped away.<p>A moment later, Xellos appeared on the rooftop<br/>where she had once been standing. Another image<br/>appeared in front of him, Jadeite's face. "We have<br/>a problem. I need you."<p>"Why, I had no idea you swung that way old<br/>friend," said Jadeite calmly.<p>"You've been spending too much time around<br/>Zocite and Kunzite," replied the man casually. "I<br/>need you to distract Usagi, she's following a<br/>Yakuza somewhere. Looks like he's pretty high<br/>ranked too."<p>"In over her head?" asked Jadeite with a<br/>chuckle.<p>"Not really, but it's more trouble than I<br/>think she wants to get into if she does find<br/>something. This is more of a hobby for her than<br/>anything, those kidnappings and such were mostly<br/>one-time things. If she's not careful, she'll get<br/>pulled into something a lot more serious and<br/>complicated than she's ready for."<p>"I see," replied Jadeite calmly. "I'll see<br/>what I can do."<p>"Do that," said Xellos as he vanished.<p>++++++++++++<p>Usagi frowned as she looked down on the<br/>mansion that the limo had driven into. "What? I<br/>guess he just went home," she said with a small<br/>sigh. She waited anyway and frowned when several<br/>other expensive looking cars pulled up to the<br/>building. "What's this? A party?" Her eyes<br/>narrowed as she jumped down into the street and<br/>started towards the building.<p>++++++++++++<p>Getting into the building was easy enough. She<br/>changed her appearance and now looked like a woman<br/>in her early twenties. She was wearing a business<br/>suit and her long blonde hair was now tied into a<br/>tight bun on the back of her head. A pair of<br/>sophisticated looking glasses appeared on her face<br/>as well.<p>No one tried to stop her as she walked into<br/>the building. What she found, she definitely<br/>wasn't expecting. She was standing in the middle<br/>of a whorehouse. She snorted in disgust and went<br/>in anyway, it would seem odd if she just walked<br/>out. Xellos had taught her a lot over the past few<br/>months. She knew it would be best if she waited<br/>for one of the men in suits to leave, and followed<br/>him out. It would look like she was working for<br/>him, and he'd stopped off for a little relaxation<br/>after a meeting or something. Then she could slip<br/>away quietly.<p>One of the men walked up to her and smirked<br/>lecherously. "How much for a night with you?"<p>"Do I look like one of these whores to you?"<br/>she snapped as she leveled a glare at him angrily.<p>The man chuckled at this and grinned. "No, but<br/>that makes you more interesting."<p>"Find yourself someone more willing, pig," she<br/>snapped sharply.<p>"I see, you're upset your boss isn't satisfied<br/>with you," he said with a small shrug. "Is that<br/>it?"<p>She turned away and stormed off in a huff.<br/>After a moment, she sat down in one of the chairs<br/>that lined the walls, away from the whores that<br/>lounged around the room lazily, waiting for<br/>someone to find them interesting.<p>She was pissed after almost fifteen minutes of<br/>watching more men come in. No one left, but there<br/>were a few other women sitting with her now. Most<br/>of them in the same position.<p>"Why do they bring us to these places," said<br/>the redhead to her right. She was in her early<br/>thirties and had a scowl on her face much the same<br/>as her companions.<p>"Who knows? I think they either just don't<br/>care, or they want to humiliate us," responded the<br/>brunette to her right.<p>"Why do you put up with them if you don't like<br/>it?" asked Usagi with the same irritation in her<br/>voice.<p>"Hey, you're here too. They're all sexist<br/>pigs, disgusting perverts, and complete jerks. We<br/>all know that, but we put up with them because<br/>they take care of us. We're relief at the office,<br/>we work well, and their wives are good at ignoring<br/>us more than they ignore places like this."<p>"No better than the women who work here I<br/>suppose," said Usagi with a small sigh.<p>"Don't say that darling. I can see you're new<br/>to this," said the redhead sympathetically. "We<br/>only do what we do for money it's true, but we<br/>only do it for one man." She winked at her and<br/>smirked. "As long as we're young and pretty, we're<br/>set. The retirement plan is great too, they'll pay<br/>for us for the rest of our lives out of gratitude,<br/>and to keep us quiet."<p>"If they don't kill us that is," joked the<br/>brunette.<p>"You make it sound...not so bad," muttered<br/>Usagi in surprise.<p>The redhead laughed at this. "We aren't<br/>criminals dear, but our lovers are."<p>"Hey! My boss is a governor!" snapped the<br/>Brunette.<p>"If he's here, you can bet he's dabbled in a<br/>little criminal behavior. In fact, that's what<br/>this place is," responded the redhead.<p>The woman blushed slightly and turned her head<br/>away.<p>Usagi had stopped paying attention though,<br/>something had caught her eye. A man in overalls<br/>walked over to one of the men hanging around the<br/>back of the room. He'd come from a stairwell that<br/>led to the basement. The man leaned into the<br/>character in a suit and whispered something in his<br/>ear.<p>Usagi stood up and started walking towards<br/>them slowly. She was cautious and moved slowly.<p>"Hello," said a man who walked up to her and<br/>grabbed her arm roughly. "I haven't seen you<br/>around here before."<p>Usagi gasped and glared at him as she jerked<br/>her arm away from him. "Back off I'm not here to<br/>entertain you."<p>The man snorted in disgust and grabbed her<br/>roughly. "How dare you speak to me that way wench!<br/>I think your boss will appreciate me teaching you<br/>a lesson! He started to pull her towards the<br/>stairs roughly.<p>That was when he suddenly jerked to a stop and<br/>almost lost his grip on the woman. She was<br/>standing firmly in place, and seemed to almost be<br/>riveted to the floor. "Let me go, or you'll regret<br/>it," she said coolly. Everyone had their attention<br/>on her now.<p>The man reared his hand back to slap her, but<br/>stopped as her features slowly melted away,<br/>revealing a much younger girl dressed in a fuku.<br/>Long tendrils of ribbons floated in the air behind<br/>her, and an aura of menace surrounded her. "I was<br/>going to leave quietly, but then I noticed<br/>something is going on downstairs. Plus, you've<br/>gone and done something stupid. I think I'll have<br/>a little fun before I leave now."<p>The man jumped back in horror, but not before<br/>the ribbons lashed out and snagged him. He was<br/>thrown into the wall and left a crater in his<br/>wake. He slumped down against the wall as Usagi<br/>was lifted into the air as several of her ribbons<br/>latched onto the floor. There were now dozens of<br/>them floating around her, grabbing men in suits<br/>indiscriminately and tossing them around the room.<p>The one by the wall with the man in the<br/>overalls simply stared in shock. He turned his<br/>head and said something to the figure in the<br/>overalls. The man dashed down the stairs and he<br/>continued to stare at the girl.<p>"What are you looking at?" she snarled as she<br/>moved towards him. Her ribbons acting like the<br/>legs of a spider as she crawled across the floor<br/>and walls towards him.<p>"Cool!" he exclaimed with tears in his eyes.<p>Usagi blinked and almost fell out of the air.<br/>"Huh?"<p>"A real magical girl! What's your name!"<br/>cried the man as he almost fell to his knees in<br/>front of her.<p>"I'm...uh...Sailor Moon," she replied dumbly.<p>"Can I have your autograph?" said the man with<br/>a fanatical smile on his face. "This is so cool! I<br/>didn't think stuff like this was real!"<p>Usagi took the pen and pad he'd offered her<br/>and signed it. She wasn't quite over the shock of<br/>her situation. Her ribbons continued to work<br/>around her, disarming thugs and throwing people<br/>around the room.<p>"Do you have a handsome and mysterious<br/>boyfriend?" asked the man cheerfully as he took<br/>his pad back.<p>"Yeah, kinda. How do you know about that?" she<br/>muttered dumbly.<p>"This is so great!" said the man. "I'm Tanaka.<br/>I'm an evil Yakuza. It's always been my dream to<br/>be one of those villainous Bishonen guys! I never<br/>thought my dream would come true!"<p>"Huh?" said Usagi with confusion clear on her<br/>face.<p>"Are you doing anything later?" he said<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Gross! I'm fourteen! You pervert!" snapped<br/>the girl angrily. Her ribbons started to reach for<br/>the man.<p>"Oh, you've probably already got a boyfriend<br/>then," said the man as he looked at the floor and<br/>mulled over this.<p>"I just told you I did!" snapped Usagi.<p>"Well, I'm pretty bishonen, don't you think? I<br/>could be better," he said cheerfully.<p>"Not really, you're kinda short, and your hair<br/>is all greasy," replied the girl as she pointed to<br/>his slicked back hairstyle.<p>"Hmmm, maybe I should start fluffing my hair<br/>some? Do you think I'd look good with long hair?<br/>Maybe I should grow it out some..."<p>"Um, you'd probably look better with short<br/>hair really," said the girl honestly.<p>"You're right. I should fluff it out some.<br/>Maybe get an earring too," said the man with a<br/>small snort. "Of course, I'd need a cape, and some<br/>armor. A really big sword or a rapier would<br/>probably help too."<p>"You'd still be too short," said Usagi<br/>irritably. "Look, I've got to destroy this place<br/>in righteous anger. So, sorry about this."<p>Tanaka blinked as he saw one of the ribbons<br/>wrap around his waist. There wasn't really anyone<br/>left standing in the room anymore. People had<br/>stopped bursting from the bedrooms, and most of<br/>anyone who could had already run away.<p>"Well, I suppose I'll have to stop you," said<br/>Tanaka cheerfully. "Man this is so cool!"<p>Usagi blinked as a strange sound emerged from<br/>the stairwell that led to the basement. "What's<br/>that?"<p>"That's just Vahn. I'm sorry about this, but I<br/>am the villain it seems. I have to try and kill<br/>you now. You understand? Hopefully you'll escape,<br/>and we'll have all sorts of interesting battles!"<p>"Right," grumbled Usagi as she tossed him<br/>aside and he hit the wall roughly. The man<br/>staggered to his feet and she ignored him in favor<br/>of the doorway with the strange noises coming from<br/>it.<p>The small wooden frame exploded outward, and<br/>Usagi gasped. "What the fuck?"<p>"Meet Vahn, my servant," said Tanaka as he<br/>stumbled forward a little.<p>The thing emerged from the hole that had once<br/>been a door. It was huge, eight feet tall and<br/>completely metal.<p>"A robot?" gasped Usagi as she backed away.<p>"Cyborg actually," replied Tanaka proudly.<p>The mechanical legs were bent back, like those<br/>of a bird. The metal claws on the end dug into the<br/>ground, supporting the massive weight and<br/>balancing the thing as it stood there. Its torso<br/>was huge, almost four feet wide. A skull like head<br/>glared at her with glowing eyes. A closer<br/>inspection revealed it to be more of a helmet than<br/>an artificial head. The arms were the scariest<br/>part of it. Two thick cable like protrusions that<br/>resembled a pair of muscular human arms. On the<br/>ends of both arms was a huge set of claws. One<br/>resembled a human hand, while the left arm had<br/>four finger like protrusions opposite one another.<br/>Each of them ended in a sharp blade. In the center<br/>of the palm was a small hole. Usagi could see<br/>quite a few door like seams in the chest and<br/>shoulders. Probably hiding hidden firearms of some<br/>sort.<p>"No fucking way!" she muttered in horror.<p>"Impressive ne?" said Tanaka cheerfully. His<br/>face fell as he snarled at Vahn. "Kill her."<p>"You are not the one I seek," said the thing<br/>as it started towards the girl.<p>"You're not so big. I'll kick your ass!"<br/>snarled Usagi as she rushed forward.<p>The thing leveled its left arm at her and the<br/>girl's eyes went wide. A roar filled the room and<br/>Usagi found herself sprawled across the ground and<br/>rolling on the carpet in pain. She had noticed a<br/>small hole in his shoulder that spat out around<br/>twenty spent shells. Her chest was smoking, and<br/>there was a scorch mark on her chest. "Damn!"<p>Vahn chuckled as he lurched forward.<br/>"Interesting."<p>"Monster! I'll kill you for that!" snarled the<br/>girl as she sat up.<p>Vahn responded by grabbing her face with his<br/>left arm, the four claw like fingers grabbing her<br/>head.<p>Usagi screamed in pain as the barrel burned at<br/>her face. Vahn lifted her up off the ground and<br/>held her. Her ribbons were desperately wrapping<br/>around the thing. Sparks were being thrown off the<br/>thing's hide as they met with the razor edge of<br/>the ribbons.<p>Vahn ignored this, and began to increase the<br/>pressure on her head, a long threaded rod began to<br/>slowly rotate out of the back of his shoulder as<br/>the claws started to crush her head. "I had hoped<br/>this would be more interesting. My true opponent<br/>will be less disappointing I hope."<p>Usagi screamed as her head pounded in pain.<br/>Finally, she grit her teeth, her entire body<br/>suddenly changed. She turned silver, and the sound<br/>of gears grinding inside Vahn's shoulder sounded.<p>The metallic Usagi raised her fists forward<br/>and pointed them at Vahn. Her hands turned to<br/>metal spikes and shot forward, slamming into the<br/>thing's chest. A few sparks flew from the impact,<br/>but Vahn's chest was little more than slightly<br/>dented.<p>The cyborg snorted and opened fire with its<br/>arm cannon, blasting Usagi in the face at point<br/>blank range. She flew from his grasp and slammed<br/>into the wall. She grunted from the impact, but<br/>slowly rose to her feet again. "Bastard! It'll<br/>take more than you to kill me!"<p>Vahn had started his next attack already<br/>though. Usagi gasped as two compartments on his<br/>shoulders opened. Two mini-guns rose up on either<br/>side of his head and started firing.<p>The girl screamed as she was pelted with high<br/>velocity bullets. Her costume protected her, but<br/>she could feel the bruising they were causing on<br/>her body. "Damn!" she screamed again as she fell<br/>to her knees.<p>"You are no match for me," said Vahn coldly.<br/>His right hand slid into his wrist, and a blade of<br/>energy formed on his arm. It looked something like<br/>a four-foot blowtorch.<p>"This is really gonna hurt," muttered Usagi as<br/>she struggled to move. Her eyes were latched onto<br/>the flame as the thing moved towards her. She<br/>wasn't sure if her costume could protect her from<br/>that. She screamed in effort and her ribbons<br/>lifted her off the ground and onto the ceiling<br/>away from the thing's slash just in time. "Damn<br/>it!"<p>Vahn snorted and looked up at her. Usagi's<br/>eyes went wide as she saw something large emerge<br/>from its back. A jetpack, the thing had a damn<br/>jetpack. The jets roared to life and Vahn crouched<br/>to leap up at her.<p>"No!" she screamed as she willed herself to<br/>move, but it was obvious she wouldn't be fast<br/>enough.<p>"SHI SHI HOUKOU DAN!"<p>"Wa?" gasped the girl as a beam of power<br/>slammed into Vahn and sent him crashing into a<br/>wall. She dropped down to the ground, but didn't<br/>have the strength to stand despite the fact that<br/>she'd landed on her feet.<p>A familiar pair of arms wrapped around her and<br/>she gasped.<p>Ryoga Hibiki was glaring at the thing in the<br/>wall as it struggled to right itself again. He<br/>glanced at Tanaka and then started to back away.<br/>"Sailor Moon. Are you all right?"<p>"Not really," replied the girl weakly.<p>"Bastards," growled the boy as he turned and<br/>ran, carrying the girl in his arms.<p>++++++++++++++<p>A few minutes later, Ryoga was sitting in a<br/>quiet park with a fire going in front of him.<br/>Usagi was lying on the ground resting next to him.<p>"Are you hurt?" he asked her gently as he<br/>touched her face lightly.<p>"Not really, that thing was really strong<br/>though. I'll be a little sore, but I'm fine thanks<br/>to you."<p>Ryoga nodded and frowned at her. "You<br/>shouldn't have tried fighting that thing! You<br/>could have been killed!"<p>"I can't run away," she replied calmly. "If I<br/>don't fight it, who will?"<p>Ryoga closed his eyes and nodded. "Still."<p>"Don't worry. I'm sure it has a weakness, I've<br/>just got to find it," she said with a smile on her<br/>face. She blinked suddenly. "Hey. What the heck<br/>were you doing in a place like that?"<p>"What? What place?" he replied dumbly.<p>"That was a whore house! Why were you there?<br/>What, I'm not good enough?"<p>Ryoga went beet red. "What? No! I heard the<br/>noises, and went to check it out! I had no idea!"<br/>he replied as fast as he could.<p>"Oh," said the girl sheepishly. She wrapped<br/>her arms around his neck. "Thank you Ryoga."<p>"Yeah, sure," he muttered in embarrassment.<br/>"Anytime."<p>"I don't know what I would have done if you<br/>hadn't come along, I mean it," she replied.<p>"I couldn't let anything happen to you,"<br/>replied the boy with a romantic look on his face<br/>for the briefest of moments. "You should get home,<br/>you need rest."<p>"Ryoga, I don't think I need any sleep," she<br/>said with a smirk growing on her face. She pulled<br/>him down into a kiss and he floundered on top of<br/>her for a moment before relaxing.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Oh my," muttered Jadeite as he stared at the<br/>scene for a shadow. "Who could have known she had<br/>it in her?"<p>Xellos appeared beside him. "Oh, again?" he<br/>muttered in slight disgust.<p>"Aren't they..." asked Jadeite as he looked at<br/>Xellos for a moment.<p>"Yes, neither of them knows though," said<br/>Xellos with a smirk on his face. "Still, this<br/>thing could be a problem."<p>"You're right, Usagi might not survive another<br/>encounter with it. I couldn't make it fast enough<br/>to stop her," said Jadeite. "I arrived just about<br/>the same time he did. I would have had to blow my<br/>cover and save her if not for him."<p>"Such a shame," snorted Xellos lazily. "In any<br/>case, I'll set mother on the right path, she<br/>should be able to handle this. This is right up<br/>Dan's alley really. They'll probably enjoy it."<p>"Should we interrupt them? Yohiko won't be<br/>pleased to find out her daughter is sleeping with<br/>her cousin," asked Jadeite nervously.<p>"No, as far as I'm concerned, neither one of<br/>us knows about this. We're safer that way," said<br/>Xellos with a slight wavering in his voice. "I'm<br/>surprised the boy didn't pass out yet. Look at<br/>what she's doing to him."<p>"I'd rather not. Incest isn't my thing," said<br/>Jadeite with a slightly sick frown. "Zocite and<br/>Kunzite I can deal with, this is just sick."<p>"I'll be surprised if the boy manages to<br/>survive when her mother finds out about this,"<br/>agreed Xellos as he started walking.<p>"She doesn't know about Sailor Moon yet? I'm<br/>surprised, she gets pretty banged up sometimes,"<br/>commented Jadeite.<p>"I've been healing anything major," said<br/>Xellos. "Small wounds can be attributed to her<br/>training."<p>"Oh," said Jadeite with a small shrug. "I'll<br/>be seeing you."<p>"Yes, it's almost time," agreed Xellos as he<br/>faded into the shadows.<p>Jadeite shuddered as a cry of pleasure floated<br/>over to where he was standing. "Little perverts,"<br/>he grumbled as he faded away as well.<p>++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: Vahn's Revenge, the final chapter!<p>
