</div>Insertion<p>Part 71<p>Akane's Wedding<p>+++++++++++++<p>Cologne frowned as she sat in the Cat Cafe and<br/>looked at Shampoo.<p>"Something is wrong Great Grandmother?" asked<br/>the girl in confusion.<p>"Yes, I'm afraid there is. I have some bad<br/>news Shampoo, it concerns the son in law."<p>The girl sat upright and frowned at the old<br/>woman for a moment. "What is talking?"<p>"Your intended, has been gone for some time my<br/>dear," said the old woman calmly. "He left almost<br/>eight months ago."<p>Shampoo blinked at this and shook her head.<br/>"Ranma not go anywhere, Shampoo see him..."<p>"That boy, was not the son in law. I am sorry<br/>for deceiving you Shampoo, but I had hoped you<br/>would grow distant from the boy. It was our plan<br/>from the start."<p>Shampoo let out a nervous laugh and waved the<br/>comment aside. "Is funny joke..."<p>"I am not joking, the boy who has been helping<br/>me is known as Carrot. He agreed to pretend to be<br/>the son in law until we could discover a way to<br/>break this too you." The old woman stood up.<p>"What is talking?" said the girl with a cold<br/>looking frown forming on her face.<p>"Silence, and I will explain," said Cologne.<br/>"A while back, the son in law went off and married<br/>the Musk prince Herb. It was done in secret,<br/>before any of us had time to think or react to it.<br/>I knew you would be foolish enough to chase him."<p>"What?" said Shampoo with horror forming on<br/>her face.<p>"The boy you have been chasing, is a double<br/>for the son in law. In fact, he's not even really<br/>a man. I wasn't aware of this, but when I found<br/>out, I knew this had to stop. I am sorry."<p>"Great Grandmother lying!" screamed the girl<br/>as she stood up and glared at the old woman<br/>angrily.<p>"Sit down!" snapped Cologne in an<br/>authoritative voice. "You will listen to me<br/>child."<p>The girl reluctantly did so, and scowled at<br/>the hag angrily.<p>Cologne sighed. "It was our hope that you<br/>would drift apart. Your devotion was more than<br/>even I had counted on." She shook her head gently<br/>and sighed again. "Unfortunately, I can not allow<br/>this to continue."<p>Shampoo merely stared dumbly at the woman.<p>"Ranma Saotome, as you have known him, is the<br/>curse of a woman known as Yohiko Hibiki."<p>"Miss Yohiko?" said Shampoo in shock. "Shampoo<br/>teacher?"<p>"Yes, she did not like doing this for me, but<br/>agreed. I cannot have you chasing the boy any<br/>longer. He lives in China, and is the ruler of the<br/>Musk kingdom now. Your heart, though dear to me as<br/>it is, would no doubt start a war between our<br/>tribes if you followed it. I'm sorry, but you must<br/>stop chasing him. Starting at this moment."<p>"No! Ranma belong to Shampoo I not...!"<p>"Enough! This must end Shampoo; I cannot allow<br/>you to go on with this any longer! You have lost!<br/>Now you must accept that!"<p>Tears were flowing down the girl's face as she<br/>stared at the old woman in shock.<p>"I am sorry, I tried my best to win him for<br/>you, and tried to protect you from doing something<br/>foolish as long as I could. Even I am not<br/>infallible. We have both failed child. It is<br/>over."<p>The girl stood up and rushed up the stairs to<br/>her room, slamming the door.<p>Cologne gave a heavy sigh and shook her head.<br/>"What a fool I am."<p>Mousse came down the stairs with an angry<br/>snarl on his face and weapons brandished in his<br/>hands. "Saotome! How dare you!"<p>"Mousse?" said the hag dumbly.<p>"Where is he? I'll cut his heart out for<br/>making Shampoo cry!" snarled the boy as he shook a<br/>stool violently. "Tell me old woman!"<p>"Ranma Saotome is not at fault, that was my<br/>doing," said the old woman calmly.<p>"What?" said Mousse in horror.<p>"Shampoo is not permitted to chase the boy any<br/>longer, Ranma Saotome is no longer her betrothed."<p>Mousse merely stood there with his jaw hanging<br/>down. "What?"<p>"You heard me boy," said the hag coolly.<p>"This is the happiest moment of my life!"<br/>cried the boy in joy as he dashed up the stairs<br/>after his beloved.<p>"Mousse!" snapped Cologne. She sighed and sat<br/>back down, the boy was still as stupid as he ever<br/>was.<p>The fact that his beaten form came barreling<br/>down the stairs a moment later didn't perturb him<br/>in the slightest. "My love! At last we can be<br/>together! You don't have to pretend to be in love<br/>with that fool any longer!"<p>Cologne hopped away, washing her hands of the<br/>situation. "Let him get himself killed, then I can<br/>stop worrying about him."<p>+++++++++++++<p>Yohiko frowned as she stood next to Shampoo in<br/>the hallway of Furinkan with Shampoo during the<br/>lunch break. That day had been a break in the<br/>normality of her life so far. Shampoo was in a<br/>foul mood, and Ukyo seemed almost pleasant.<p>"Well?" asked the woman impatiently.<p>"Is true?" said Shampoo as she glared at the<br/>woman.<p>"Told you did she?" said Yohiko with a sudden<br/>understanding in her voice.<p>"So, it true. Why you do thing like that to<br/>Shampoo?"<p>"I felt obligated to her, even though I don't<br/>agree with what she's done," said the woman with a<br/>small sigh.<p>Shampoo frowned, tears forming in her eyes.<br/>"So, Ranma leave Shampoo?"<p>"Why do you think Kuonji's been in such a foul<br/>mood lately? Plus Akane Tendo leaving to marry her<br/>new fiancee? All of this was because of him, don't<br/>think you were alone in this."<p>The girl gasped and looked up at the woman's<br/>small frown. Yohiko shrugged her shoulders and<br/>gripped the girl by her arms. "Look, I'm sorry<br/>about what happened. Hopefully, you'll use this to<br/>make yourself stronger rather than allow it to<br/>weaken you. There isn't much else I can say or do<br/>about it. I wish there was, but it's not my<br/>place."<p>The girl hung her head and nodded. "Shampoo<br/>understand, well not really. Shampoo don't know<br/>why, but not angry, not with teacher anyway."<p>"I'm glad, I'd hate to have to beat you up,"<br/>said the woman with a pleasant looking smile.<p>"You not underestimate Amazon strength!"<br/>snapped Shampoo irritably.<p>"You're right, I shouldn't," agreed the woman.<p>Ukyo walked up with a frown on her face after<br/>Shampoo had left. Yohiko arched her eyebrow<br/>slightly as she found herself holding a small<br/>folded paper. "What's this?"<p>"I'm withdrawing from school," said the girl<br/>as she stared at the teacher.<p>"May I ask why?" asked Yohiko calmly.<p>"I'm almost there. I've almost got enough<br/>saved up. I'll be going to China within two months<br/>time. I'll find that bastard, and make him pay."<p>Yohiko nodded slowly at this. "You know you<br/>can't win."<p>"That doesn't mean I can't try," replied the<br/>girl coldly.<p>"This doesn't suit you Ukyo, but there isn't<br/>anything I can do about that," replied the woman<br/>as she nodded and looked over the paper.<p>"You're wrong, this is what I've been for most<br/>of my life," replied the girl calmly as she turned<br/>away.<p>"Yes, it's a shame," agreed Yohiko as she<br/>walked away.<p>"Isn't it though?" muttered Ukyo with a<br/>bittersweet tone in her voice.<p>Yohiko sighed as she turned to glance back at<br/>the girl for a moment. "And so, the last bond is<br/>shattered."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Some time later...<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ryoga Hibiki frowned as he strolled through<br/>the streets of Tokyo, his injuries were now<br/>healing, and it had now been almost a month since<br/>that fateful night. His thoughts were broken, his<br/>heart shattered. "Damn," he mumbled as he found<br/>himself standing in front of a large building.<p>Usagi Hibiki was staring at him as she left<br/>the school at the end of her day.<p>"Ryoga?" she muttered in shock.<p>"Hello Usagi," he replied calmly. He turned<br/>his eyes away and started walking again.<p>"Wait!" cried the girl as she rushed after<br/>him. "Is that all you have to say to me?"<p>"I've dishonored you, made a mockery of our<br/>family and name, and now..."<p>"We're family," said the girl with a frown on<br/>her face. "We don't have to like it Ryoga, but we<br/>didn't know. I'm sorry, it was my fault."<p>"We're both to blame," he said with a heavy<br/>sigh as he realized she wasn't going to let him<br/>just walk away.<p>"Where are you going?" she asked with a small<br/>smile.<p>"Away from here, as far as I could, of course<br/>I should have known that it would bring me right<br/>too you sooner or later."<p>Usagi nodded her head and sighed. "I'm sorry."<p>"Stop saying that," he said a little shortly.<br/>"Look, I don't think it would be a good idea for<br/>us to be around one another."<p>The girl shook her head. "No, that isn't<br/>right. I haven't known anyone in my family because<br/>of your curse. I finally get to meet one of you,<br/>and you're going to start acting like this? All I<br/>have besides you is my mother."<p>Ryoga flinched slightly and sighed. "I don't<br/>understand."<p>"Mother will forgive you," she said with a<br/>small frown. "But not if you don't even try."<p>"I don't want her forgiveness, I deserved what<br/>I got," he replied sharply. "I'm lucky she's so<br/>nice, I would have killed me."<p>"Don't say things like that!" snapped Usagi.<p>"Sorry," he replied as he glanced away from<br/>her.<p>"I don't want every time we talk with each<br/>other to be another apology," said Usagi firmly.<br/>"Where are you going. I'll help you get there."<p>Ryoga blinked and blushed suddenly. "The Tendo<br/>dojo. I don't think it would be a good idea for<br/>you to go with me."<p>"Huh? Why not...?" Usagi trailed off and<br/>smirked at her cousin. "A girl? It's a girl isn't<br/>it?"<p>Ryoga blushed a little harder and turned away<br/>from her.<p>"That's great! What's her name? How do you<br/>know her?"<p>"Akane Tendo, she was my first love. Before<br/>you..." said the boy with a slightly pained frown.<p>"Oh!" Usagi blushed and frowned. "I didn't<br/>come between you did I?"<p>"No, it was something else. I'd almost given<br/>up on her already, now..."<p>"You've got to try again," said Usagi with a<br/>slight nod.<p>"I can't let my chance slip through my<br/>fingers," said the boy with a short nod.<p>"Well, I'll take you there," said Usagi<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Right," said the boy.<p>"Well, come on then," said the girl<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Tendo? Where have I heard that name before?"<br/>muttered Usagi with a slight frown on her face.<br/>She suddenly froze and stared at Ryoga. "The<br/>wedding! Tomorrow! I...Oh no! He doesn't know?"<br/>screamed the girl's mind as everything fell into<br/>place. "What should I do? I can't break his heart<br/>like that! I..." She didn't even realize that<br/>she'd started crying.<p>Ryoga paused as the girl froze up and stared<br/>at her in confusion for a moment. "What? Is<br/>something wrong? Why are you crying?"<p>The girl stared at him for a moment. "Oh! Oh<br/>Ryoga! I can't...I can't do that to you again!"<p>The boy's jaw hardened and he glared at her.<br/>"What are you talking about?"<p>"I'm sorry! I can't!" she said as she started<br/>to back away.<p>The lost boy managed to snag her arm and pull<br/>her back to him before she could run. "What?<br/>What's wrong? What is this about me?"<p>Usagi was shaking and she turned her head in<br/>shame. "Ryoga. Akane Tendo, I'm sorry."<p>"Something has happened to Akane?" cried the<br/>boy in horror. "You'd better tell me!"<p>"She doesn't live at the Tendo dojo anymore,"<br/>said the girl.<p>"What?" said Ryoga. "Did those two idiot men<br/>lose that dojo to someone again? Without Ranma<br/>around, it doesn't surprise me. I'll have to get<br/>it back for them then!"<p>"No, Ryoga. Akane has moved in with her<br/>fiance, she's getting married tomorrow," said the<br/>girl.<p>"What?" said Ryoga as he suddenly went<br/>completely still. "Akane?"<p>"My mother was invited to the wedding! I have<br/>to go with her tomorrow," said the girl as she<br/>looked at him with a deep sorrow in her eyes. "I'm<br/>so sorry! I...this is all my fault!"<p>"Your fault?" said the boy with a sort of lost<br/>and distant stare. "How?"<p>"If I hadn't been, if we hadn't...you might<br/>have..." said the girl as she sobbed. "I can't ask<br/>your forgiveness for this! I..."<p>Ryoga was shaking, tears began to flow freely<br/>from his eyes as he dashed away. "NOOOOOOOOOO!"<p>Usagi fell to her knees as the boy started to<br/>round a corner clutching his head. She paused when<br/>he swatted aside a huge animal that had moved in<br/>front of him without stopping.<p>"Katsunishi!" cried a girl that rushed up to<br/>the animal's side. She paused and watched as the<br/>boy continued to run down the street.<p>"Oh! Are you all right?" cried Usagi as she<br/>rushed up to the girl's side. "He isn't hurt is<br/>he? I'm sorry, Ryoga can be..."<p>"Ryoga? Is that the boy's name?" asked the<br/>girl with a small frown on her face.<p>"I'm terribly sorry, he's just had his heart<br/>broken. Please forgive him," said Usagi with a low<br/>bow. "He didn't know what was happening. I'm sure<br/>of it."<p>"His heart broken?" asked the girl in<br/>confusion.<p>"Yes, I'm terribly sorry, please forgive him.<br/>He's not hurt is he?"<p>The animal was grunting and struggling back to<br/>his feet. "Don't worry, he's fine." She smiled at<br/>the girl warmly. "Tell me about this boy? Who is<br/>he? How do you know him? He's very strong."<p>"Um, yes. His name is Ryoga, he's...my<br/>cousin," said Usagi with a blush on her cheeks.<p>"Oh," replied the girl as her smile widened.<br/>"My name is Akari Unryuu. This is Katsunishi."<p>"Um, hi," muttered Usagi lamely as she<br/>realized the absurdity of the situation. She was<br/>staring at an eight-foot tall pig, and it was<br/>smiling and nodding at her. "I'm Usagi Hibiki.<br/>Nice to meet you."<p>"A pleasure!" said the girl cheerfully. "Well,<br/>I should go. We'll meet again one day, I'm sure of<br/>it."<p>"Right," agreed Usagi dumbly. "That<br/>was...strange; even for me."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Yohiko smiled as she breathed in the fresh<br/>mountain air and walked with her daughter at her<br/>side. Xellos was standing right behind her, with<br/>Nephrite at his side.<p>"So, this wedding is in the mountains?" asked<br/>Usagi.<p>"Yes, it will be a small affair, we'll<br/>probably be the only guests really. Shinnosuke<br/>only has his grandfather, and Akane isn't dumb<br/>enough to invite her family along," said Xellos.<p>"Oh," said Usagi in confusion. "Why is that?"<p>"Because they'll try to stop the wedding if<br/>they do show up," said Yohiko calmly. "Don't worry<br/>dear."<p>"Oh," said the girl with a frown on her face.<br/>"What if they show up and try to stop it anyway?"<p>"They just might, that's one reason why I<br/>wanted all of us to come. Akane deserves to be<br/>happy. I'm not going to let that happen. I'll stop<br/>anyone who tries to disturb this wedding."<p>Usagi nodded and sighed. "Oh, that's nice of<br/>you. I guess..."<p>"We're almost there," said Yohiko with a smirk<br/>on her face.<p>"What makes you say that?" muttered Xellos<br/>calmly. He was staring at a gigantic lizard that<br/>was clinging to a nearby tree.<p>"What is this place?" muttered Usagi<br/>nervously. Her ribbons started to appear around<br/>her body and floated around defensively.<p>"Put those away dear, we're perfectly safe,"<br/>said Yohiko with a slight frown. "The springs in<br/>this area have magical properties, and they make<br/>the animals grow unusually large. It's not a real<br/>danger."<p>Nephrite smirked. "Yes, what we really have to<br/>worry about are..." He promptly fell into a hole<br/>and was covered in rocks that fell on him from<br/>above. "...the traps."<p>Xellos smirked and waved his arm. Tiny specks<br/>of light suddenly became visible across their<br/>field of vision. "Don't get near the lights,<br/>that's where the traps are," he informed them.<p>Nephrite climbed out of the trap and frowned.<br/>"You could have done that sooner!"<p>"Yes, I could have," said the man cheerfully.<p>"What are you doing here? Don't you know it's<br/>dangerous?" snapped a voice from in front of the<br/>group.<p>Usagi blushed at the incredibly handsome boy<br/>who appeared out of the mist with a frown on his<br/>face. He was holding a staff in his hand and<br/>glared at them all coldly.<p>"Why yes, we know exactly how dangerous it is<br/>here," said Xellos cheerfully.<p>"Well, hello Shinnosuke. Patrolling on your<br/>wedding day?" said Yohiko with a smirk on her<br/>face.<p>"Who are you? What do you want? What do you<br/>mean wedding day?" snapped the boy angrily.<p>"Shinnosuke?" said Usagi with a slight<br/>disappointment in her voice. Then she realized<br/>what he had said. "What? There's no wedding?"<p>"No, the idiot forgot about it, that's all,"<br/>said Yohiko with a smirk on her face.<p>"Do I know you?" said the boy as he stared at<br/>Yohiko for a minute.<p>"Yes you do," said the woman with a smirk on<br/>her face. "It's been a while Shinnosuke. I suggest<br/>you come with us, or Akane will be angry."<p>The boy scratched his head and frowned.<br/>"Akane? I suppose so." He noticed the tattoo on<br/>the back of his hand and frowned. "You're right! I<br/>haven't written her a letter today!"<p>"Dolt," grumbled Yohiko flatly.<p>"Is something wrong with him?" asked Usagi.<p>"He has the memory as long as Xellos's<br/>attention span," said the woman with a small<br/>snort.<p>"Hey!" muttered the mage with a hurt look on<br/>his face.<p>"Come on dope, I've got to change that<br/>tattoo," grumbled Yohiko as she grabbed the boy by<br/>his arm and started to pull him along. "You'll<br/>drown her in letters if I don't. She lives with<br/>you halfwit!"<p>"Oh, she does?" muttered the boy in confusion.<br/>"Hey! She does! I'd better get back soon, I don't<br/>want to miss breakfast."<p>++++++++++++<p>The group made it to the home and a familiar<br/>figure rushed up to them. "Miss Yohiko! You came?"<p>"Well! Hello! You should have told me you<br/>invited them dear!" said the old man who stood<br/>with Akane in the front yard. They were working in<br/>a small garden in front of the home.<p>"All this work today? You're planning on<br/>getting married today aren't you?" said Yohiko<br/>with a small frown on her face.<p>"Yes, but...the chores don't wait," she said<br/>sheepishly.<p>Yohiko frowned at the old man. "They can wait<br/>for a day."<p>"We have to keep things relatively the same<br/>here, or Shinnosuke gets confused, more than<br/>normal," said the old man with a shrug.<p>"Hmmm, well I managed to drag him back," said<br/>Yohiko with a smirk on her face. "So tell me<br/>Akane, how many times has he proposed since you<br/>came here?"<p>"Huh?" said Shinnosuke dumbly.<p>"Seventeen," muttered the girl with a blush on<br/>her face.<p>"I proposed to Akane?" cried the boy in shock.<p>"Yes dolt, you're getting married today.<br/>That's why we're here," said Yohiko.<p>"Who are you again?" muttered the boy.<p>"This is getting annoying," said Nephrite.<p>"He's a good kid," replied Xellos with a<br/>shrug.<p>"At any rate, it's time we got started. I<br/>don't believe you're dressed that way Akane!"<br/>cried Yohiko as she took the girl by her arm.<p>"I guess that leaves us stuck with Captain<br/>Memory here," said Xellos with a small sigh.<p>++++++++++<p>Akane was wearing a simple white dress and<br/>blushed heavily. "I shouldn't yet. I've got to go<br/>escort the priest here."<p>Yohiko smirked at this and chuckled. "Don't<br/>worry dear, I'll send my brother to get him."<p>"Oh," said the girl sheepishly. "Thank you."<p>"Not a problem. So, have you been enjoying<br/>your stay here so far?"<p>"It's been wonderful, almost like a dream,"<br/>said the girl wistfully.<p>"Hmmm. I imagine it would be," agreed Yohiko.<br/>"He's a very handsome boy." No one noticed the<br/>slightly disgusted flash on her face, it vanished<br/>as quickly as it came.<p>"Wow, I hope I meet someone as handsome as him<br/>one day," said Usagi cheerfully.<p>"Oh! I haven't introduced you two yet. I'd<br/>forgotten that you'd never met before. Akane, this<br/>is Usagi, my daughter."<p>"What?" said the girl in shock. "You've got a<br/>daughter this old?"<p>"Everyone is always surprised about that,"<br/>said the woman with a cheerful smile on her face.<p>"Wow," said Akane as she smiled at the younger<br/>girl.<p>"I just hope it runs in the family," said<br/>Usagi with a small sigh.<p>"No kidding," agreed Akane, "I hope I age as<br/>perfectly as that."<p>"Now, this is your day Akane, I'm supposed to<br/>be the one complimenting you," chided Yohiko<br/>lightly.<p>"Yes, thank you," said the girl. "I didn't<br/>think you'd really come."<p>"I wouldn't miss it, besides, you'll need the<br/>protection," said the woman cheerfully.<p>"Huh?" said the girl in confusion.<p>"Your father is still out there, as well as<br/>Ranma Saotome's father," replied the woman with a<br/>slight frown. "That's part of the reason I brought<br/>so many people along with me."<p>"So, you know about that do you?" said the<br/>girl with a slight frown on her face.<p>"I promise I won't let them interfere," said<br/>Yohiko with a smirk on her face. "I also won't<br/>hurt them too badly if they show up and step out<br/>of line. Don't worry dear."<p>"Thank you," said the girl with a huge blush<br/>on her face. "Miss Yohiko?"<p>"Hmmm?"<p>"Nevermind, it's nothing," said the girl as<br/>she sighed and sat down on a small stool.<p>"All right. You're beautiful, you know that?"<br/>said the woman.<p>"Thank you, that means a lot coming from you,"<br/>said the girl as she smiled back at her.<p>"Wow," agreed Usagi with her own blush. "This<br/>is all so...romantic!"<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Saotome! This is it!" said Soun firmly as he<br/>stood in front of the dark woods with his hands on<br/>his hips.<p>"Indeed Tendo, this is the first step. We'll<br/>retrieve that ungrateful daughter of yours, and<br/>then go find my son! We'll ensure the schools are<br/>united yet!"<p>Kasumi was standing behind them with Nabiki at<br/>her side. "Oh my! I hope she's all right! Poor<br/>Akane, she's been kidnapped by these horrible<br/>people!"<p>"She wasn't kidnapped. This is her boyfriend<br/>remember? She came here on her own to marry him,"<br/>grumbled Nabiki. She was obviously unhappy about<br/>being here.<p>"Oh. Hello. Are you here for the wedding?"<br/>said the priest that walked up behind them with a<br/>smile on his face.<p>Soun and Genma turned to face him and blinked.<p>"Why yes, yes we are," said Genma.<p>"Oh, how nice. I was told to wait here for an<br/>escort. These woods are dangerous," said the<br/>priest as he looked at the woods for a moment and<br/>smiled.<p>The two men looked at each other and then back<br/>at the priest.<p>"Is something wrong?"<p>Nabiki shook her head and sighed. There wasn't<br/>anything she could do to stop her idiot parents<br/>from ruining this. Well, nothing she hadn't<br/>already done, but that wouldn't come into play<br/>until later.<p>Within moments, the priest was tied to a tree<br/>and relieved of his clothing. He was also out<br/>cold.<p>A small boy appeared out of the woods and<br/>smiled at them. "Well, you must be the priest."<p>"Indeed," said Soun as he adjusted his collar.<p>"Who are these other people?"<p>"They help me set up for the ceremony," said<br/>Soun nervously.<p>Nephrite smirked at them and turned into the<br/>woods. "I suppose I'm the guide then. Follow me<br/>please."<p>+++++++++++++<p>About an hour later, Nabiki smirked as Genma<br/>and Soun fell into their thirty-second trap of the<br/>day.<p>"Watch out, there's a trap there," said the<br/>boy calmly.<p>"Yes, too late once again," said Soun.<p>"Well, you should be more careful. I told you<br/>about them."<p>Nabiki sighed and shook her head again. "Look,<br/>I know you're stalling them, but I don't want to<br/>miss my sister's wedding. Could we please go there<br/>now?"<p>The boy blinked and looked at Genma and Soun.<br/>"I suppose I've done enough to them. They're too<br/>beat up to pose much of a problem."<p>"Oh my!" said Kasumi.<p>"Yes, I suppose so," said Nabiki as she<br/>smirked.<p>"We're just going to lie here for a while,"<br/>said Soun. Genma silently agreed by nodding his<br/>head.<p>"Oh, well. You just stay there. I'm going to<br/>take these ladies to their sister's wedding. I'm<br/>sure Xellos has retrieved the real priest by now."<br/>He smirked at the looks on their faces as they<br/>realized they had been duped. "Don't get any<br/>stupid ideas in your heads either. You don't stand<br/>a chance of stopping this. Akane has a lot of very<br/>angry friends."<p>"You have no idea," commented Nabiki.<p>"Well, I was referring to people who aren't<br/>going to try and stop this," said the boy with a<br/>shrug.<p>"Oh, well then. Shall we?" said Nabiki<br/>cheerfully.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Yohiko smiled as Nabiki and Kasumi rushed up<br/>to their sister and hugged her warmly. There was<br/>lots of girlish squealing, even some from Nabiki.<br/>She smirked and walked up to the pair with a smile<br/>on her face.<p>"Well hello. I trust the idiots are resting<br/>soundly by now?" she asked with a smirk on her<br/>face.<p>Nabiki nodded. "I don't think they'll be<br/>bothering us. I made sure of it actually."<p>"Oh?" asked Yohiko cheerfully.<p>"Well, I'm glad to see you approve," said the<br/>woman with a warm grin.<p>"Oh! Akane! I'm so proud of you!" cried Kasumi<br/>as she started sobbing on her youngest sibling's<br/>shoulder.<p>"Well, daddy isn't here. I guess someone has<br/>to do it," commented Nabiki.<p>++++++++++++<p>Xellos smirked as he sat with all the men<br/>involved, including the priest. Nephrite was<br/>sitting lazily and running a projector.<p>Shinnosuke was as white as a sheet as he<br/>stared at the image on the wall in shock. "What is<br/>this? I..."<p>Xellos chuckled and pat his hand on the small<br/>pile of porn movies they had yet to watch. "It's a<br/>tradition. Try and enjoy yourself."<p>The boy merely nodded and simply sat there<br/>with his mouth hung open.<p>His grandfather had tears in his eyes as he<br/>stared at the screen. "Oh no! Do you think Orgasmo<br/>will be able to escape this time?"<p>The priest merely blushed and looked at the<br/>men. "I don't think it's tradition for me to be<br/>here for this part."<p>"Sorry, it's for your own safety, there are a<br/>few people who don't want this to happen, and that<br/>makes you a target. You're safe with us though,"<br/>said Nephrite calmly.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Now where am I?" cried Ryoga Hibiki as he<br/>glanced around at the forest around him in<br/>frustration.<p>The large animals that surrounded him were<br/>vaguely familiar, but he couldn't quite place it.<br/>"Damn! I've got to find Akane before it's too<br/>late!"<p>Unbeknownst to him, but knownst to us, a<br/>figure sat on top of a gigantic animal of her own,<br/>following the trail. The huge creature looked<br/>oddly in place in the strange forest.<p>"You're sure he went this way Katsunishi?"<p>The giant pig grunted and nodded vigorously as<br/>it continued to follow the scent trail the boy<br/>left behind.<p>"Onward then!" cried the girl with a grin<br/>forming on her face. "Ryoga Hibiki! I will find<br/>you!"<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ukyo Kuonji frowned as she looked at the map<br/>in her hands. She turned her head towards her<br/>partner and frowned. "You're sure about this?"<p>"Yes, Shampoo sure," said her companion as<br/>they stood looking at the intimidating forest.<br/>"Spatula girl not trust Shampoo?"<p>"Of course I don't," replied Ukyo with a small<br/>snort.<p>"Is good, Shampoo deceive Spatula Girl many<br/>times."<p>"Well let's go sugar," said Ukyo with a smirk<br/>on her face. "We gotta find Akane before it's too<br/>late."<p>"Shampoo understand," said the girl firmly.<p>"Right. Come on," said Ukyo as she started to<br/>move forward.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Can you move, Tendo?"<p>"Yes, Saotome."<p>"Come on then! We've got to make it before<br/>it's too late!"<p>"Quite so, Saotome!"<p>+++++++++++<p>"It's time," said Yohiko as she smiled down at<br/>the incredibly nervous girl.<p>"Right," agreed Usagi with a cheerful smile on<br/>her face.<p>"I'm ready," said Akane more to herself than<br/>anyone else.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to witness<br/>the holy union of Akane Tendo, and Shinnosuke..."<p>"Stop!" cried a pair of familiar voices from<br/>the back of the small clearing where everyone was<br/>seated.<p>Akane turned around, horror on her face as she<br/>looked at Soun and Genma. The pair was standing<br/>next to each other and glared angrily at those<br/>gathered.<p>"Damn it! I didn't think they'd recover this<br/>fast," said Nephrite angrily.<p>Yohiko stood up and turned to face the pair.<p>"Akane!" cried another familiar voice. Ryoga<br/>staggered through the trees. "You can't! I..." He<br/>paused when he noticed the scene in front of him.<br/>"Huh?"<p>"No!" cried Akane with tears of pain in her<br/>eyes. "You can't! I won't let you ruin this!" She<br/>was glaring at Soun and Genma as she said it, but<br/>the words drove a spike of pain through the lost<br/>boy's heart.<p>"What?" muttered Ryoga to himself in<br/>confusion. "This is...she...she wants this?"<p>"Keep going," said Yohiko as she smiled at<br/>Akane and the priest. "We'll handle this. I won't<br/>allow them to ruin this for you, don't worry."<p>"She's right," agreed Usagi as a mass of<br/>ribbons appeared from her back. "No one has the<br/>right to take such a wonderful memory away from a<br/>young girl! On behalf of the moon, I shall punish<br/>you!"<p>"I had hoped those traps would be enough to<br/>stop you, but you're dumber than I'd thought. I'm<br/>gonna have to take care of this myself it seems."<p>"Don't hog all the fun, just don't forget not<br/>to kill them," said Xellos. "Akane wouldn't like<br/>that."<p>"Aiya! We not make it in time?" cried a<br/>familiar voice.<p>"Maybe not, Sugar," said Ukyo as both she and<br/>Shampoo appeared on either side of the altar.<p>"Damn! What the hell are those two doing<br/>here?" growled Yohiko in frustration. She turned<br/>and glared at Nabiki for a moment, only to meet a<br/>cool looking smile. "So, she's still going to go<br/>through with this?"<p>"Ha!" snarled Genma. He turned to look at<br/>Ryoga for a moment. "Come on boy! Now is your<br/>chance! They can't take all of us!"<p>"Heh, Don't worry sweetie, we'll handle these<br/>two thugs. I've got a score to settle with the fat<br/>one anyway," said Ukyo as she leveled her glare at<br/>Genma.<p>"Shampoo agree, men not interfere with this<br/>now. She not allow it!"<p>The girl looked at them in shock. "What?"<p>"Take your time. Sugar, I don't want to miss<br/>this. You should have invited us," said Ukyo as<br/>she smirked at Akane.<p>"Shampoo agree, but will forgive Violent Girl<br/>this time,"<p>Genma and Soun backed away, and everyone<br/>turned their attention on Ryoga Hibiki. He was<br/>standing there in silence with a scowl on his<br/>face. He looked at Akane and his gaze intensified.<br/>"Akane. Is this what you want? Is this what will<br/>make you happy?"<p>The girl blinked at his words, not quite<br/>understanding why he was asking her that. "Yes."<br/>She hadn't even hesitated in her answer.<p>The boy smiled at her and nodded his head.<br/>"Then I guess...it was meant to be. I won't allow<br/>these two to stop it. Goodbye then." Rather than<br/>run away, Ryoga turned to look at the pair of men<br/>standing in the center of an angry looking mob. "I<br/>won't allow you to destroy Akane's happiness!"<p>Genma and Soun were frozen in shock, neither<br/>had enough sense to run, and the two of them<br/>didn't have a working pair brain cells to rub<br/>together at the moment.<p>Ryoga turned his attention towards Shinnosuke<br/>and frowned at him for a moment. "If you ever hurt<br/>Akane, I'll destroy you. You'd better make her<br/>happy!"<p>"Wait! You can't Akane! I won't allow this!"<br/>cried Soun as he tried to rush forward with his<br/>head becoming a huge demonic figure. "I won't let<br/>you taint my little girl's honor!"<p>"Out of our way! You can't stop us!" agreed<br/>Genma.<p>It was probably the dumbest thing the pair had<br/>ever done.<p>+++++++++++++<p>The ceremony went perfectly after that. Soun<br/>and Genma were hung just outside the reception by<br/>their feet from a branch. They were tightly bound<br/>and had gags over their mouths.<p>The party afterwards was more than anyone had<br/>expected. Food was limited, but Ukyo did help with<br/>that as best she could. In the end, everything<br/>went well.<p>The crowd dispersed just before it got dark,<br/>leaving only Yohiko and Usagi behind as they stood<br/>with Akane and her new husband.<p>"Well, it's time to say goodbye," said Yohiko.<p>"Yes. I can't thank you enough," said Akane as<br/>she bowed deeply.<p>"I suppose I'll have to cut the idiots down<br/>before I leave," said Yohiko with a small sigh.<p>"Yeah," agreed Akane with a slight blush.<p>"I guess I'll probably have to do this when<br/>Nabiki finally ties the knot as well. Kasumi is<br/>probably pretty safe, but I'd best show up for<br/>that one as well. Just to be safe," said Yohiko<br/>cheerfully.<p>"You have our gratitude," said Shinnosuke's<br/>grandfather.<p>"Don't forget to thank your sister. Nabiki is<br/>the one who had Ukyo and Shampoo show up. She had<br/>me scared for a moment."<p>Akane blushed. "Me too."<p>"It seems you have more friends than you<br/>realized. Although, I doubt if you'll see each<br/>other anytime soon. I believe the Amazon's are<br/>going back to China soon, and Ukyo won't be far<br/>after them. She's still intent on her revenge. Who<br/>knows, she might get it. Not in the way she's<br/>hoping for though."<p>Akane nodded and smiled at the pair. "It's<br/>getting late, are you sure you don't need to<br/>stay?"<p>"Yes, the woods are very dangerous," agreed<br/>Shinnosuke.<p>"We'll be fine. You two need your privacy<br/>tonight," said Yohiko with a small chuckle.<p>Akane blushed deeply, and Shinnosuke got a<br/>confused looking frown on his face. "Privacy? I<br/>wonder why? Maybe after we got married we would,<br/>but..."<p>"That dope forgot already?" whispered Usagi<br/>in disbelief.<p>"Shhh, Akane will remind him soon enough,"<br/>replied Yohiko quietly.<p>"Thank you again, for everything," said Akane<br/>as she bowed deeply.<p>"Not a problem," said Yohiko as she turned<br/>away with her daughter at her side.<p>Akane looked at Shinnosuke for a moment and<br/>smiled warmly. "I'm sorry. Just this once." She<br/>rushed away from him and rushed up to Yohiko.<br/>"Wait!"<p>"Huh?" said the woman as she turned to look at<br/>the girl.<p>"Please forgive me, but I have to do it. Just<br/>once!" said the girl as she jumped into the<br/>woman's arms and kissed her deeply.<p>Yohiko couldn't move she was so shocked. She<br/>felt the girl's tongue inside her mouth and the<br/>male portion of her returned the action and<br/>grabbed the girl.<p>Akane blushed and they stayed that way for a<br/>moment, breaking off and breathing deeply. "Miss<br/>Yohiko?" said the girl in shock.<p>"Only because it was just this once dear,"<br/>said the woman as she winked at her.<p>"Thank you," said the girl as she blushed. "I<br/>love you."<p>"Well, you're very special to me, Akane," said<br/>the woman as she smiled at the girl. "I hope you<br/>live well. I'm sure we'll see each other again<br/>some time."<p>"Visit any time!" said Akane with tears<br/>forming in her eyes.<p>"I just might take you up on that someday,"<br/>said the woman cheerfully.<p>"Yes! Visit -anytime-!" said Shinnosuke's<br/>grandfather.<p>The boy was simply staring at the scene in<br/>shock. His jaw was hanging down and there was a<br/>small trickle of blood coming out of his nose.<p>Akane turned away and started walking back<br/>towards her husband.<p>Yohiko turned to find her daughter staring at<br/>her in a sort of disgusted shock. "M-mom?"<p>"Don't worry dear," said the woman as she pat<br/>the girl on her head.<p>"Oh, you were just being nice? I mean, it was<br/>just cause it was that one time, and she's married<br/>now? Right?"<p>The woman turned to look at her daughter and<br/>pat her on the head. "It's something like that<br/>dear."<p>"Whew," said Usagi as she turned away. "Can we<br/>go now?"<p>"Yes dear, we're going home," said Yohiko<br/>cheerfully.<p>"Okay. I'm tired, it's been a long day," said<br/>Usagi.<p>"Speaking of long day. What was with that<br/>stupid speech you gave earlier?" said Yohiko as<br/>she looked down at her daughter. "'I'll punish you<br/>on behalf of the moon?' What the hell were you<br/>thinking child?"<p>"Moooommm!"<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ryoga Hibiki looked up at the stars as he lay<br/>on his back. His heart was shattered again, but<br/>this time, it also left a slightly warm feeling in<br/>his chest. It wasn't quite as empty as it had been<br/>before he had come here. "I suppose I really had<br/>accepted my defeat a long time ago."<p>He sighed again and began to stare at the sky<br/>in silent contemplation. "Things...I guess they<br/>have a way of working out. Damn you Ranma, I can't<br/>blame you for this one."<p>A huge black forehead and a large pair of eyes<br/>suddenly overshadowed his view. "Huh?"<p>"Bweeee!"<p>"You found him Katsunishi!"<p>"What the hell?"<p>"Oh Ryoga! I've found you at last my love!"<p>"What? Who are you?"<p>+++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: Rise of the Phoenix!<p>
