</div>Insertion<p>Part 13<p>Diamonds are Forever.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Jadeite?" muttered Ranma in shock as he simply stared down at the<br/>countertop with a frown on his face.<p>"It was those damn Senshi," said Nephrite angrily.<p>"Beryl didn't revive him?" asked the boy as he stared at the trio<br/>of dark generals for a moment.<p>"Ha! She sealed him away, to ensure that we wouldn't," commented<br/>Zocite with a frown of his own. "Once we get that crystal, she'll be<br/>more apt to listen to our request though."<p>"How?" asked Ranma as he glared at them angrily.<p>"It was that despicable Sailor Moon, she hit him with<br/>something..." muttered Kunzite.<p>Ranma merely nodded and downed the remainder of his drink. "I'll<br/>see you guys later."<p>"Right, family calls," chuckled Kunzite.<p>"No. I need to be alone for a while," said Ranma as he stepped out<br/>of the bar and left them.<p>++++++++++++<p>"You know, he wasn't that bad a guy. Well, for someone who was<br/>trying to destroy the world and all," said Carrot wistfully.<p>"Yeah," muttered Ranma in agreement.<p>"Beryl is being stupid," commented Carrot as they walked through<br/>the park they had found themselves in.<p>"Howzat?" asked Dan.<p>"She's just cut her forces down. Jadeite and his minions are not<br/>available to her anymore," said Carrot with a small shrug. "It's a bad<br/>tactical decision."<p>"I woulda brought him back," muttered Ranma angrily. "Even if I<br/>didn't like him. He was one of her soldiers, she can't do that to her<br/>men."<p>"Well, we aren't her. She's spiteful and evil, more so now that<br/>she's working for Metallia," said Carrot with a small shrug. "There's<br/>nothing we can do about it."<p>"Yeah, let's just go home," muttered Carrot.<p>"You're quiet tonight, Pissant. Not that I'm complaining or<br/>anything," said Dan.<p>There was a small sniffling, and they felt their body jerk forward<br/>as it burst into tears. "WAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! He's dead!<br/>WAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!"<p>"Great," grumbled Dan irritably.<p>"Calm down damn it!" cried Carrot.<p>"I hope nobody is watching us," said Ranma nervously.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Huh?" muttered Ranma as he looked up at Genma and Soun. It was<br/>early the next day, and he had a day off. It was Sunday, and Cologne<br/>had decided to excuse him for the evening.<p>"We've been hired on as security. There's a showing of some<br/>valuable gem in some Museum. Soun knows one of the curators, and we've<br/>got to protect this gem this evening for some kind of formal party,"<br/>said Genma sagely.<p>"How much am I getting paid?" said Ranma as he narrowed his eyes<br/>at the man.<p>"They're going to pay us ten thousand yen," said Genma with a<br/>small nod.<p>"No old man, how much am I going to get paid?" repeated Ranma.<p>"Foolish boy! This is for the honor of your school!" snapped the<br/>man angrily.<p>"In other words, you want me to take my day off, and do this for free,<br/>so that you can keep all the money to yourself," said the boy with a<br/>small frown.<p>"Um, right," said Genma dumbly.<p>"No thanks," said Ranma as he started to walk away.<p>"What? Don't you walk away from me boy!" snapped the man angrily<br/>as he tried to turn his son around by pulling on his shoulder.<p>Ranma was immovable though, he did stop walking. "Look old man.<br/>Why should we bother? You still get paid without us, all you have to<br/>do is stand around, and we've got a job already, and we don't want to<br/>take our time off and do something like this if we aren't getting paid<br/>for it."<p>"Look, I don't care about the other two of you, but Ranma has to<br/>train. This is part of it," snapped Genma irritably.<p>"Fine, then you pay us for our time," said the boy calmly.<p>Genma frowned. "I'll give you a thousand yen."<p>"Three, or you can go fuck yourself for all I care," said Ranma in<br/>reply.<p>Genma frowned at this, he was only going to get three if he took<br/>Soun with him. The deal was for the three of them, at ten thousand. If<br/>only two of them showed up, they'd only get three apiece. He and Soun<br/>were going to split it at five apiece, now he'd only get three. That<br/>wasn't acceptable. "Two."<p>"Twenty five hundred," said the boy as he smirked at the old man.<p>Genma scowled at him, and hung his head. "Fine."<p>"What time?" asked Ranma cheerfully.<p>"It starts at six," muttered Genma irritably.<p>++++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo was pressing herself against the wall just around the<br/>corner. Her hand covering her mouth as she tried her best not to say<br/>anything. Her mind was working as she attempted to figure out what was<br/>going on.<p>Ranma haggling with her father hadn't surprised her, but something<br/>else bothered her. The boy had called himself 'we'. Genma seemed to<br/>know about it too. That sent alarm bells ringing inside her head the<br/>instant it had left his mouth.<p>"The question is, what can I do about this?" she muttered to<br/>herself as she snuck away. There had to be a way to work it to her<br/>advantage. Ranma was crazy, she knew that now for certain. She<br/>couldn't do anything about it without some sort of proof, and he was<br/>actually pretty good at hiding it despite the way he acted sometimes.<p>+++++++++++++++++<p>It was about three hours later that the men stood around the<br/>table. Genma and Soun were dressed in cheesy looking light blue<br/>tuxedos. Ranma had not even bothered to wear the one they had given<br/>him, and strolled out in a black suit and tie. His shades were stuck<br/>in his pocket, and he grinned at them cheerfully. "Ready?"<p>"Where did you get that boy?" snapped Genma.<p>"Huh? I've got a job remember?" said the boy with a small shrug.<br/>"I've got three of em." He brushed off one of the sleeves on his coat<br/>and walked past the two morons calmly. "Hey, you coming or not?"<p>Akane walked out of her room and stared down at him cheerfully.<p>"Akane?" asked Soun dumbly.<p>"What is it daddy?" said the girl as she looked at him. She was<br/>wearing an outfit similar to Ranma's, but with a skirt and dark<br/>pantyhose instead.<p>"What is she doing boy?" snapped Genma.<p>"Going with us," he replied with a small shrug.<p>"We can't bring a girl along on something like..." Genma grabbed<br/>the man by his tie, and pulled it off. "Tsk, a clip on? Really Pop."<br/>He placed it back on and then grabbed his collar, pulling him down to<br/>stare at him for a moment. "Akane is training too right?"<p>"Well...I..."<p>"That is why you wanted me along, right?" continued the boy.<p>"Now, Saotome, this is far to dangerous for..."<p>"Well, I suppose we could call and tell that guy that there's only<br/>three of us now, and go back to getting only ten thousand yen for the<br/>night, instead of twenty."<p>Genma and Soun blinked and stared at him. "What?"<p>"Mr. Tendo left the number out. So I called the guy, and asked if<br/>he'd be willing to pay for an extra hand. He agreed, and we all get<br/>checks cut for five thousand each."<p>Genma looked at Soun for a moment, and then back to his son again.<br/>"We'll probably just be standing around all night anyway Tendo."<p>"Right, agreed Saotome," said the man as they ushered the children<br/>along.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Wow!" gasped Akane as she stared at the party in awe. There were<br/>dozens of people ambling about, all of them dressed in extravagant<br/>clothing. Tables with the food and champagne lined the back walls, and<br/>at the center of the room was a display case in protective glass. It<br/>was roped off, and a sparkling gem could be seen inside.<p>Ranma moved up beside her, his face was completely straight and<br/>his shades hid his eyes away. "We're security. Try to look<br/>intimidating."<p>She blinked and turned to look at him for a moment. "Right." She<br/>put on her own shades and began to move smoothly through the crowd.<p>"Follow me, I know what I'm doing," said Ranma coolly as he moved<br/>towards the edge of the room.<p>Akane moved after him and frowned. "And I don't?"<p>"Have you ever done this sort of thing before?" he said as he<br/>looked back at her with his eyebrow raised slightly.<p>The girl blushed a bit and turned her head away. "Well, no..."<p>"I have, several times. Trust me," said the boy as he nodded back<br/>at her. After a moment, they were standing on a flight of stairs that<br/>led to the upper level of the museum. They were roped off near the top<br/>preventing partygoers from wandering off.<p>Ranma smirked as he noticed a small group of men standing around<br/>about halfway up.<p>"The man who hired us will most likely be there," said Ranma as he<br/>began to stroll up towards them.<p>An older man in the group paused his conversation and looked at<br/>the young pair for a moment. The two youngest members of the group,<br/>who were standing off to the side silently, moved to intercept.<p>Ranma and Akane paused, neither one of them flinching as the much<br/>larger bodyguards stopped them. He removed his sunglasses, and she<br/>followed his example as they noticed the old man approaching.<p>"Can I help you?" asked the man as he walked up between his guards<br/>and looked them over.<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome, and this is Akane Tendo. We're from the<br/>Anything Goes School of Martial arts," said Ranma emotionlessly.<p>"Ah, the extra security I hired," said the man as he waved the men<br/>off to the side.<p>"That's right, what sort of security do you have in place now? If<br/>I can be permitted to know?" asked Ranma coldly.<p>"You've done this sort of thing before," said the man with a small<br/>smile growing on his face. "We have the standard security for<br/>something this valuable of course, protective glass, silent alarm<br/>system, infrared laser net. Naturally there are a few inactive systems<br/>that protect it when the museum is closed, but you don't need to know<br/>about those," said the man calmly.<p>"Nor am I particularly interested," replied Ranma. "I want to know<br/>what's active, and where I need to be."<p>"Well, we have security cameras..." started the old man.<p>"Six of them in plain sight, and probably at least two more hidden<br/>somewhere," said the boy with a nod.<p>"Very good Mr. Saotome," said the old man as he chuckled a little.<br/>"Well, enjoy the party. A disturbance is unlikely, and we want you<br/>more for show than anything else. Just hang around the diamond, and<br/>keep people from getting too close."<p>"Next time sir, I'd appreciate it if we were allowed early. Just<br/>before you start letting guests in is good. It's better if we're seen<br/>when they come in," said Ranma with a small nod.<p>"And why is that?" asked the old man in amusement.<p>"That way, they know we're security," said Ranma as he put his<br/>shades back on and walked back into the crowd.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Where are our parents?" asked Akane as she glanced around. They<br/>were standing on either side of the display now, watching the crowd<br/>around them.<p>Occasionally, she or Ranma would have to move someone back a<br/>little, or clear a small path so photos of the gem could be taken by<br/>the press in attendance.<p>"Slacking off by the food, they should be drunk in a little while,"<br/>commented Ranma as he turned his head over towards the pair and<br/>frowned.<p>"Those dolts," growled Akane.<p>"Calm down and forget about them," said Ranma coldly.<p>"How can I just let them get away with that?" she hissed.<p>"Because right now, no one knows who they are. They're just two<br/>drunken assholes who probably got invited by accident. We're the ones<br/>representing your school in everyone's eyes right now."<p>Akane blinked and looked at him for a moment.<p>"Don't worry, we'll get the chance to get back at them shortly,"<br/>said Ranma with a small smirk forming on his face.<p>Akane nodded, and noticed that it was the first time she'd seen<br/>him smile at all since they had arrived. It wasn't a nice one either.<p>+++++++++++++<p>A half-hour later, Genma and Soun were thrown bodily from the<br/>building. The two teens walked out, dusting off their hands and<br/>staring at them angrily.<p>"Boy! What do you think you're doing?" sputtered Genma.<p>"Kicking you two out, like we were told too," said the boy calmly.<br/>"Go home."<p>"We were hired to protect..." started Soun angrily.<p>"And you've been doing a shitty job too," replied Ranma calmly.<br/>"Both of you are drunk."<p>"We were just enjoying the party a little, there's no harm in..."<br/>started Genma.<p>"If you truly value the honor of the Anything Goes School, you<br/>will leave right now," said Ranma coldly.<p>"What?" said the pair in shock.<p>"I won't repeat myself, go home," said Ranma as he took off his<br/>sunglasses and stared them down.<p>"Daddy, we'll take care of this," said Akane nervously.<p>"Akane? How could you!" said the man in shock.<p>"You're embarrassing us, and the school's name, go home," insisted<br/>Ranma.<p>Genma turned his head, and noticed the cab pulling up behind them.<br/>"Let's go Tendo, we aren't wanted here."<p>Ranma strolled down the steps, and paid the cab driver while Akane<br/>returned to the inside of the building. He leaned his head in and<br/>smiled at him. "Take them directly to the Tendo Dojo in Nerima." He<br/>jot down the address on a pad of paper. "They don't have any money, so<br/>don't take them anywhere else. No matter what they say."<p>"Huh?" said the cab driver as he looked at the boy.<p>Ranma winked at him, and showed him their wallets. "Just take em<br/>home all right."<p>"Right," said the cab driver with a smirk on his face.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma walked back into the museum, and went back to his position.<p>"This is boring," he commented.<p>"Wow. You're pretty good at this, Dan," said Carrot.<p>"I told you I was a cop. Doing things like this is a good way to<br/>make a little extra money," he replied calmly.<p>"Wow! This is such a great party," commented Pissant cheerfully.<br/>"I wish we could talk to someone though."<p>"You keep your trap shut, we aren't here to mingle," said Dan<br/>irritably.<p>"Uh oh," muttered Carrot suddenly as he turned their head.<p>"What's up?" asked Dan with a small frown.<p>"Damn. I shoulda known," grumbled Carrot. "Five o'clock. Blond,<br/>white dress, meatball head."<p>"Shit! I told you we should have left her at home," snorted Dan<br/>angrily as he saw Usagi. She was looking rather lost in the crowd,<br/>after a few moments of scanning the crowd, he saw the other senshi as<br/>well. Including the one he didn't recognize. "Who the hell is that?"<p>"I dunno, she's a senshi, but I've never seen her before," said<br/>Carrot as they eyed her. Rei and Ami had both spotted them, but hadn't<br/>done anything yet other than stare, and inform the others. "We've been<br/>spotted."<p>"I noticed," said Dan as he glanced towards Akane. She was<br/>watching the crowd lazily.<p>"Maybe they won't try anything? I mean, this is a pretty big<br/>crowd..." muttered Pissant fearfully.<p>"If we don't do anything, maybe," agreed Dan.<p>"Hey. I see Tux boy," said Carrot as he glanced up at the rafters<br/>and spotted Endimyon.<p>"This isn't good," growled Ranma.<p>"Keep cool, we might not have to do anything at all," said Dan.<p>"I doubt it, I'm betting Nephrite will show in a minute. If they<br/>think this thing might be the Silver Imperium Crystal..." muttered<br/>Carrot irritably.<p>"Maybe we can intercept?" asked Dan as he searched the crowd for a<br/>sign of the general.<p>"Maybe, we might be able to talk him out of this," said Ranma in<br/>agreement.<p>After a moment, they spotted him in the crowd. He was holding a<br/>glass of champagne, and smirking as he watched the diamond.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Akane, stay here. I'm gonna check something out," said Ranma as<br/>he turned towards the girl.<p>She turned her head, and watched helplessly as he moved into the<br/>crowd. "But..."<p>"Ah, Genaku," said Nephrite as he noticed his friend.<p>"Turn away, act like you don't know me," said Ranma as he<br/>approached.<p>"Pardon?" said the general dumbly as he did so.<p>"I know why you're here Nephrite. You might as well leave now,<br/>that isn't the Silver Imperium Crystal."<p>"So? I have to bring something back," snorted the man casually as<br/>he eyed one of the women nearby casually.<p>"I'm working security here Nephrite, I'll be most disappointed if<br/>I have to stop you. You know how much I hate screwing up a job."<p>"Humph, I'm afraid I can't allow that," said the man coldly.<p>"Well, we've had this battle before Nephrite. Both of us know who<br/>will win," said Ranma with a slight smirk on his face.<p>"That may be, but if I go back to Beryl without even trying, she<br/>will destroy me," said Nephrite calmly.<p>"Fine, keep away from that girl beside the diamond, she's not<br/>strong enough to hurt you anyway. We don't know each other, and I'll<br/>try to make sure you get out of here alive."<p>"Alive?" muttered the general as he turned his head slightly.<p>"Don't look at me!" snapped Ranma. "The senshi are here too."<p>"Well, it seems you're going to have your hands full," said<br/>Nephrite calmly as he nodded.<p>"Well, if you win, you can keep that damn rock. If I win, I'll<br/>come out looking good to the man who's paying me, and if they win..."<p>"The two of us will probably be dead," said Nephrite with a smirk<br/>on his face.<p>"Right," said Ranma as he walked away.<p>"How interesting," said Nephrite as he moved away as well.<p>+++++++++++<p>The old man turned towards Ranma and blinked. "Pardon?"<p>"I said we may have a problem," said Ranma quietly.<p>"What's going on?" asked the man as he suddenly forgot about his<br/>conversation and gave him his full attention.<p>"I spotted a man fitting the description of a jewel thief<br/>operating around the area recently. I moved in to check him out, and<br/>he was faking a conversation while watching the jewel."<p>"You didn't apprehend him?" snorted the old man with a small<br/>scoff.<p>"I thought it best if we could handle this discreetly," said Ranma<br/>as he turned towards the crowd. "Uniformed guards will likely be more<br/>persuasive towards him giving up quietly."<p>The old man nodded and turned to his bodyguard. "Radio the museum<br/>security. Have them escort this man out of the building."<p>Ranma turned away with a grin on his face. The security guards<br/>would move Nephrite out of the crowd, and he would allow it before he<br/>would attack them. That just left the Senshi, and if Nephrite didn't<br/>attack, then they wouldn't have any reason to act either.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Gentlemen, I assure you this is all a mistake," said Nephrite as<br/>he led them towards a quiet room in the museum. He stopped and raised<br/>his hands into the air as he watched them circle around him.<p>"Not likely, in any case, you aren't welcome here any longer,"<br/>said Ranma as he strolled up behind the men.<p>Nephrite smirked as he noticed the boy. "Very clever," he<br/>commented to himself. He raised his hands and a dark crystal appeared<br/>there. "I'll take your life force, thank you," he said as he held it<br/>over his head.<p>The guards began to fall over around him, there were about seven<br/>of them, and their life energy seeped away and into the crystal. "A<br/>masterful plan, getting me away from the crowd that way so you could<br/>beat me more easily. In here, I can't drain all those guests. How did<br/>you know I would go with these men?"<p>"You never were one for a direct fight. You'd have sent a youma<br/>out, that way you could distract the Senshi. Especially since you knew<br/>they were in there. That way, you could steal the diamond quietly,<br/>while they were busy with your monster, and escape."<p>"Hmmm. That was my plan," said Nephrite with a small nod.<p>"You led the guards into this room when you noticed they were<br/>after you, that way, you could drain them without the senshi noticing,<br/>and make sure that you could still use your original plan."<p>"Unfortunately for you, it didn't work!" cried a new voice.<p>"Shit," muttered Ranma as he turned and faced the doorway.<p>"You who would steal the gems of our proud country! In order to<br/>protect our heritage, I Sailor Moon shall defeat you! On behalf of the<br/>moon, you are Punished!"<p>The other senshi moved up behind her, and posed. After a moment, a<br/>porthole opened in the wall and Tsuki stepped through and smirked.<p>"You stay the hell out of this and let me do my job," snapped<br/>Ranma as he narrowed his eyes at them.<p>"So, you two were planning to steal that diamond and take it back<br/>to your master were you?" said Tuxedo Mask as he appeared from another<br/>doorway in the room.<p>"I was hired as security actually," said Ranma with a small shrug.<br/>"I really hate screwing up a job, and all of you are trespassing.<br/>Leave now, or I'll make sure you regret it."<p>Ami took a step back, and swallowed. "Um...Sailor Moon..."<p>"We won't give up until you're defeated!" snapped Sailor Moon<br/>angrily.<p>"Well, it's time I left then," said Nephrite as he jumped into the<br/>shadows and vanished.<p>The sailor senshi began to encircle Ranma, closing in around him<br/>carefully, and slowly.<p>He looked around at them and frowned. "There are a lot of<br/>expensive things in here that break easily. Are you sure you want to<br/>fight now? After all, you're here to protect your heritage aren't<br/>you?"<p>Tsuki smirked at him. "Protecting our heritage is secondary to<br/>protecting the future. You must be punished for what you did to Pluto-<br/>sama. I, the Senshi of Pluto in training, shall make sure that you do<br/>not win this time!" A long staff appeared in her hand, and began to<br/>glow. "Attack him now!"<p>Ranma tensed his body, and flew back as Jupiter landed a solid<br/>blow. "What the?" he gasped painfully as he slammed into the wall.<br/>"How the hell?"<p>"What happened?" muttered Jupiter in shock. She hadn't expected to<br/>be able to hit him with her first strike.<p>"It's like he's slowed down!" gasped Sailor Moon.<p>"No, it's like they've sped up," thought Ranma as he glared at<br/>them and took up a defensive position.<p>Venus rushed forward, slamming her fist into his jaw before he<br/>could react, and sent him flying into a suit of armor. It collapsed on<br/>top of him and he grunted in pain.<p>"There's no way they're this fast!" thought the boy angrily as he<br/>stood up again. "Something is up."<p>"Not so tough this time?" said Venus as she glared at him angrily.<p>"Hurry up and beat him!" snapped Tsuki. "We don't have a lot of<br/>time!"<p>Ranma paused and looked at the girl. She hadn't moved yet, she was<br/>merely standing there, holding the staff out in front of her. "It's<br/>her!" he gasped.<p>Mamoru rushed forward as he started to tense his body up, kicking<br/>at him in order to prevent him from attacking.<p>"Kaio ken times two!" cried Ranma as he suddenly blasted forward.<br/>The senshi could see him moving this time as he ran towards Tsuki, but<br/>it was still far to fast for them to do anything about it. He landed a<br/>hard right across the girl's jaw, and sent her sprawling across the<br/>floor.<p>"Thought you could beat me by slowing down time? Is that it?" he<br/>snorted as he cracked his knuckles and turned to face the girls.<p>"No way! No one is that fast!" cried Mercury as she looked at the<br/>display on her computer screen. "It isn't possible!"<p>"I've got a job to do here, so if you don't mind..." Ranma<br/>vanished from in front of them, and reappeared at various points<br/>around them, slamming blows into their bodies repeatedly. The senshi<br/>could do nothing more than stand there and take it. One by one, they<br/>fell to the ground in pain, none of them even had the time to perform<br/>an attack to counter the assault.<p>Finally, Tuxedo Mask was the last one standing, Sailor Moon was<br/>still conscious, but she was lying on the ground and hadn't tried to<br/>get up again.<p>Ranma was standing in front of him with his arms crossed over his<br/>chest. "You know what the difference between you and me is Endimyon?"<p>The boy looked up at him and frowned. "What's that villain?"<p>Ranma pulled on the lapel of Tuxedo Mask's coat and snorted. He<br/>then put on his shades and smiled. "I make this look good." He turned<br/>away and walked out of the room. He paused in the doorway and smirked<br/>at them as they groaned painfully on the floor. "I'll be back in five<br/>minutes, and you had better be gone." He continued on his way, leaving<br/>them lying there.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Akane frowned as she saw Ranma calmly walking up to her. He was<br/>dusting off his sleeves, and his coat was slightly wrinkled now.<br/>"Where have you been?"<p>"Just getting rid of some uninvited guests. Nothing to worry<br/>about," he replied calmly. "How is the party going?"<p>"Just as boring as ever," she replied.<p>"Good, that means we're doing our job," said the boy with a shrug.<p>++++++++++++<p>"What? What do you mean no?" snapped Genma angrily as he stared at<br/>Ranma.<p>"No, as in I'm not giving you one red cent you lazy bastard?"<br/>replied the boy with a small shrug. "You got kicked out of the party<br/>for being drunk, shirked your duty, and embarrassed the school.<br/>Therefore he insisted that you and Mr. Tendo not be paid."<p>"He insisted?" muttered Soun in shock.<p>"That's right, that guy asked us not to give you any of the<br/>payment," said Akane with a small shrug.<p>"But, he paid you twenty thousand each!" cried Genma.<p>"Well, I stopped a disturbance that you two idiots wouldn't have<br/>even noticed. I also did it without interrupting the party," replied<br/>Ranma with a shrug.<p>"I spent all night standing next to that damn rock! You two were<br/>busy eating and getting drunk!" snapped Akane as she stared at the men<br/>in frustration.<p>"Well, we would have taken a shift if we had remained all<br/>night..." lied Genma.<p>"Well, you didn't. Your loss I suppose," said Ranma with a small<br/>shrug. He stood up and walked up to his room. Leaving both parents<br/>staring at him hatefully.<p>"Damn that boy! I still don't know what he does with all that<br/>money," thought Genma angrily. He'd searched high and low, and still<br/>hadn't found the boy's stash.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma smirked, and glanced back at the old man as he walked up the<br/>stairs. "That idiot, he doesn't even realize that we opened a bank<br/>account. I bet he's still going through our things looking for that<br/>money," commented Carrot cheerfully.<p>"Oh my, stealing is wrong. Maybe we should have a talk with him?"<br/>said Pissant.<p>"Naw, let him suffer," snorted Dan. "Are we taking that job next<br/>week?"<p>"Sure, I could get to like this kind of work," said Carrot<br/>cheerfully. "Akane was invited back as well. They're showing some sort<br/>of mask on loan from the Americans."<p>"Maybe we should talk with Nabiki? Set up some sort of business?"<br/>asked Dan with a smirk.<p>"Why bother with her?" replied Carrot. "With this kind of money<br/>coming in, we can quit the Cat Cafe. That would free up a lot more<br/>time for other things."<p>"I guess so," agreed Ranma.<p>"Come on, let's get some sleep," said Carrot.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: A normal day in the life of Ranma Saotome.<p>
