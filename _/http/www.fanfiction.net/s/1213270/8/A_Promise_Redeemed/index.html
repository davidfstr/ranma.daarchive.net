</div>Chapter 08 - What they do best<p>Nabiki leaned her head into Ranma and snuggled into his encircling<br/>arm, as they both got a precious few hours of rest before the ordeal<br/>they knew to be coming. The two of them recline in the cargo webbing<br/>of a C130 cargo aircraft, lulled into sleep by the drone of the<br/>engines. They were surrounded by boxes and containers containing a<br/>small but complete field hospital, medicines, and some generic relief<br/>supplies such as food, blankets, and water purifiers. Both wear<br/>modified flight suit like attire emblazoned with the logo of the<br/>International Red Cross and bearing their names on breast patches.<br/>The handles of various medical instruments and tools can be seen<br/>peeking from the various pockets and compartments of their outfits.<p>Here and there in the gloom of the crowded cargo bay, various other<br/>people could be seen employing the same precaution, rest before<br/>action. It was local night, and there were still a few hours before<br/>arriving at their destination.<p>Just behind the flight stations, a small desk was bolted to the wall,<br/>maps were spread out on it, and a laptop computer was seen spreading<br/>it's glow. A large and stocky redheaded but graying northern European<br/>man was seen there talking on a satellite phone, occasionally taking<br/>notes or looking something up on his laptop. He was dressed similarly<br/>to Ranma and Nabiki. The name tag embroidered on his breast patch<br/>identified him as one Dr. Hallfreid Føllesdal, chief administrator.<br/>Concluding his conversation, the man sighed, turned off the phone, and<br/>reached for the light switches to the compartment.<p>Groans and complaints floated ethereally from various corners and<br/>crannies as people responded to the light, and pulled themselves<br/>forward to receive whatever news had caused their waking.<p>"Everyone here, yes ? The situation has just grown much worse, and is<br/>not what we had anticipated when we left." The large man spoke<br/>English with a distinct Norwegian accent. The gathered group of<br/>people around him showed a contrasting polyglot of cultures. When the<br/>group had first formulated, English had been the language of choice,<br/>and while not everyone had spoken it with the same starting fluency,<br/>two years of constant use had at least allowed everyone to understand<br/>each other.<p>"What's up chief ?" Ranma wanted to know. "I thought this was a<br/>fairly standard post-hurricane medical relief run. Ya know,<br/>dysentery, cholera, a few broken bones &amp; get clean water working.<br/>Nothing serious."<p>"Hush up, baka, let Hallfreid say his piece." Nabiki elbowed Ranma, a<br/>process complicated by the fact that his arm was still around her, and<br/>that her arm ended up around him when done. By now, elbowing Ranma<br/>was more likely to bruise the joint of the elbower rather than having<br/>any effect on the elbowee, but it was the principle that counted.<p>"Eager as always, are we ?" the large man snorted. "Well, this may be<br/>one of the crazy situations the two of you seem to be liking then.<br/>Something happened, perhaps another Hindu and Muslim clash in the wake<br/>of the typhoon, who is to know ? The result has become wide spread<br/>rioting. Even worse, apparently that rioting has damaged an<br/>industrial center. There are reports of a very large chemical fire.<br/>We do not know the cause or exact spread, or perhaps extent, of the<br/>fire, but several of the factories in or near the fire are know to<br/>have great store of toxic chemicals."<p>"The Indian government reports that their troops have secured our<br/>landing site, and so we will not divert. We still land in two hours.<br/>We will be treating for chemical exposure and many blunt trauma<br/>wounds. Some form of decontamination apparatus will be necessary, as<br/>the Americans say, we will have to jury right. The local government is<br/>unlikely to be prepared to respond to a chemical spill in addition to<br/>restoring order and quelling the riots."<p>"I think that is 'jury rig' Hallfreid, not 'jury right'. I suppose it<br/>is too much to ask that our two crazy members provide treatment back<br/>at the base this time, yes ?" a tall elegant black woman spoke up<br/>with an amused and exasperated glance at Nabiki and Ranma. "It's only<br/>through divine providence that we haven't ended up treating our own<br/>members more than the people we purport to help."<p>"You know better than that, Thandi. All, together now, what's that<br/>famous Dr. Saotome saying ? " prompts a squat, grinning, southern<br/>Chinese man.<p>"Ya can't save lives sitt'n on your ass" choruses the group together.<p>"Yes, yes. Let's just keep the focus on saving the lives of others,<br/>rather than our own. Dr. Hong, you have the inventory of this<br/>aircraft, yes ?" Dr. Føllesdal takes control of the situation as his<br/>voice turns formal, the use of last names a sure sign that the time<br/>for banter had passed.<p>"Take Dr. Saotome with you and see how much of the hose and plastic<br/>sheeting we have, yes ? We will be needing them for chemical showers.<br/>Nurse Tendo, you have contacts with the regional Red Cross, do you not<br/>? You will please to contact them with the satellite phone and<br/>arrange a bulldozer with which to make a chemical holding pond, and<br/>also to contact the regional government for the same. I will continue<br/>discussions with the Indian military and national government about the<br/>logistical support. Dr. Inkwazi, take the rest of the group and<br/>insure that all of our equipment and packing is such that we can be<br/>unloaded and operational in the minimum time. We managed 4.5 hours<br/>last time, we will need to be operational at least that quickly again.<br/>I think we will also keep the plane ready for a quick evacuation if<br/>the toxic chemicals undergo a wide dispersal."<p>Ranma gives Nabiki a quick squeeze as the pair reluctantly separate.<br/>"Come help as soon as you're finished, right ?"<p>"Uh, huh. Just can't work alone, can you, baka ? Don't worry, With<br/>luck this won't take too long" she teases him through her own<br/>reluctance, and watches Ranma disappear with the rest of the team in<br/>the depths of the cargo. Finally, she turns back to the concerned<br/>gaze of the large Norwegian. "Okay, Dr. Føllesdal, what's really up.<br/>You and I both know that your contacts are as good or better than<br/>mine, and getting something as straightforward as some earth-movers is<br/>as easily done through the local military."<p>The graying redhead gives her a lopsided smile. "In the two years we<br/>have worked together, I have yet to successfully disassemble before<br/>you, yes ?"<p>"That's dissemble," she groans theatrically, "even we Japanese have<br/>better English classes than that, and get on with it, please."<p>He drops his smile and considers the nurse before him for a moment<br/>before continuing. "This situation differs from those you have faced<br/>before. I desire you to curtail your normal activities to an extent.<br/>I am concerned that the displays of acrobatics you and the doctor you<br/>so firmly attach yourself too are so fond of will not avail you in<br/>clouds of drifting, perhaps invisible poisons, and I wish to lose<br/>neither of you. I hope you can prevail on your daredevil friend that<br/>this situation should perhaps be handled differently. It is hopeless<br/>to try to speak with him, I have tried often enough."<p>He ends with an unusually serious personal appeal. "Please Nabiki,<br/>the patients can be brought to us, you need not seek them out."<p>Nabiki shook her head automatically. "You know we had our agreement<br/>when we first started working with you. It's unusual, yes, but<br/>effective. You have to admit we have reached and saved many people<br/>that standard rescue crews would not have been able too. And even as<br/>a resident, you yourself have admitted that Ranma's in situ medical<br/>care is as good as what they would have gotten back at the hospital."<p>"I still do not understand how you two find the victims so quickly and<br/>accurately, all your talk of ki and auras notwithstanding. Yes, yes,"<br/>he forestalls her comment, "I remember the oft repeated offer to have<br/>Dr. Saotome train us, too. I have seen what the two of you call<br/>training, however, and still have little desire to subject my old<br/>carcass to such abuse."<p>"But I leave the topic. Is there no way I can persuade you to operate<br/>with some modicum of restraint ? Despite our arrangement, I do not<br/>truly understand why it is you undertake so much more risk."<p>Nabiki cocks her head and considered. "We haven't wanted to talk<br/>about our past much. Perhaps it's time you hear, though. I guess it<br/>can do no harm at this point. Well, we have a bit of time. I'll help<br/>you arrange the necessary on site support with the Indian authorities<br/>if you'll listen to an abridged version of our history. Meanwhile,<br/>don't worry about us. Ranma has a lot more tricks up his sleeves than<br/>you've yet seen."<p>***<p>Dr. Hallfreid Føllesdal watched with trepidation as his pair of<br/>problem daredevils made ready for their customary expedition, their<br/>portion of the portable base hospital setup completed, (which portion<br/>it should be mentioned was nearly half the total work, and completed<br/>in less time than the others combined) . Nurse Tendo picking up bags<br/>of plasma, making them vanish in that inexplicable way they both used.<br/>Even stranger, they were somehow always at the perfect temperature<br/>when one of the pair retrieved them; cool when the unused ones were<br/>put back into refridgeration, and body temperature warm for use.<p>Shortly, she turned to gathering up some of their limited store of<br/>jury-rigged chemical neutralizing agents. Dr. Saotome was checking<br/>the headset communicators he had long insisted they both carry, and<br/>was demonstrating the portable medical transceivers and locator<br/>beacons to the Indian transport division army officer who was assigned<br/>to provide the team with ambulance service. The beacons, left on the<br/>patients found and treated by the pair would guide the Indian army<br/>transports to the necessary locations to pick up and return them to<br/>the base hospital. The compact pieces of technology would also<br/>provide the hospital with a live feed on the health of each patient.<p>He knew now that any hope of persuading the pair was moot. While of<br/>course he had seen their actions during earlier assignments and had<br/>suspected the two of such motivation, he had not understood the depth<br/>of their obsession. He had been exposed to some smatterings of<br/>Japanese culture during his career, and the way the young Nurse had<br/>phrased their so called obligations left him cold. In his heart, he<br/>feared that this situation was different, an ongoing threat that could<br/>not be handled the same as the raging fires, earthquakes, and even the<br/>genocidal paramilitaries they had all faced before. This was not a<br/>human enemy which could be fought, or something like fire that could<br/>be detected before it hurt, or collapsed rubble which mere physical<br/>force could effect.<p>Turning, he could see the dirty grim light of fires reflected off the<br/>low hanging pall of smoke clouds. Even at this distance, he could see<br/>that the clouds were not composed of the standard relatively harmless<br/>soot and smoke. Hints of strange and sickly colors outlined the<br/>distant gloom. Fortunately, the gentle wind was blowing out to sea,<br/>and the toxic clouds did not yet threaten the city or their field<br/>hospital. He knew how fickle the winds were at the end of monsoon,<br/>however, and feared.<p>He reminded himself again to periodically check the weather as he<br/>watched the young pair finish their preparations and suddenly bound<br/>over the line of army trucks and encircling security troops and onto<br/>the roofs of the nearest buildings. Quickly they raced outward,<br/>outpacing the lumbering army provided ambulances that would be<br/>supporting them. Turning back to the tracking and communication<br/>equipment they would use to coordinate, he offered a sincere prayer to<br/>whatever god might be listening, be his native Christian one, or the<br/>Hindu, Muslim, or Buddhist spirits who were revered locally.<p>***<p>As always in the midst of such a crisis, time soon ceased to have<br/>great meaning. Dr. Føllesdal did not know if it had been hours or<br/>days since the team had setup and begin treating patients. Additional<br/>supplies arriving from the army, the local authorities, and other<br/>international relief organizations had to be properly dispositioned.<br/>Additional medical personal arriving from local clinics too damaged to<br/>continue operations had to be integrated with his own staff.<br/>Facilities had to be jury rigged to flush and treat those victims<br/>exposed to the drifting clouds of toxic chemicals the locals had<br/>little experience in dealing with. He had organized it all, somehow,<br/>into a functioning, effective response, as always, in addition to<br/>treating his own share of the patients.<p>And, as always, a steady stream of ambulances had been entering their<br/>camp, carrying those patients the riot or hurricane damaged local<br/>hospitals did not have the space or expertise to treat. Again, as per<br/>normal, it seemed like the majority of patients flowing into their<br/>base were ones found, treated, and evacuated by the Saotome and Tendo<br/>team. The ambulance drivers and army patrols sent out from this<br/>epicenter seemed to be awe, and several comments reached him about the<br/>remarkable paucity of active rioters whenever the ambulances made<br/>pickup and along their routes. Unconscious ones abounded, however.<p>Given this workload, he could be forgiven for not noticing the weather<br/>alert he had programmed earlier flashing in the corner of one of the<br/>communication screens in the command tent. The wind was shifting, and<br/>the drifting clouds were no longer heading harmlessly to sea. Soon,<br/>they would be coming inland, instead.<p>The tall elegant black woman whose name-tag identified her as<br/>Dr. Thandi Inkwazi entered the command tent bearing two cups of coffee<br/>and some sandwiches . "Here, Hallfreid, eat. I swear you are as bad<br/>sometimes as that juvenile Japanese pair we pretend to ride herd on<br/>from time to time. Speaking of, they seem to be up to their usual<br/>tricks. Half the locals, particularly the riot injured ones, seem to<br/>ready to worship them, and the other half want to exile them as<br/>supernatural. Fortunately, Ranma apparently hasn't been caught<br/>changing sexes this time. We don't need another p.r. disaster like<br/>that. How are they, by the way ?"<p>Wearily, the big graying redhead took a bite of a sandwich and waved a<br/>hand at the communications screen. "As per normal, they seem to have<br/>exhausted the opportunity to play hero locally, and are working quite<br/>far afield by now."<p>"Hmm." the woman commented non-committally. She examining the on<br/>screen map display showing the location of the communication beacons<br/>worn by the pair, along with all the med beacons they had left to be<br/>picked up by ambulance. "What's this flashing in the corner of the<br/>screen ?"<p>Turning to answer her question, the team administrator finally saw the<br/>weather alert. By this time however, it was too late, he could see by<br/>the accompanying live satellite imagery that the toxic clouds were<br/>well inland, and if the location beacons were to be believed, Saotome<br/>and Tendo were positioned right on top of a large flaming industrial<br/>complex directly in the cloud's path.<p>"Saotome, Tendo, this is base," he turned to the communications<br/>station in a vain hope of recalling the pair.<p>"Relax Chief, if you're calling about the wind, we already know about<br/>it. I'm on top of it" came the voice of the young Japanese man over<br/>the speakers, followed by some shouted incomprehensible Japanese<br/>phrase. On the satellite feed, something very strange indeed suddenly<br/>appeared to be happening. The hotspot of the industrial fire appeared<br/>to be concentrating, growing far hotter, and gathering the drifting<br/>clouds into itself.<p>Looking out the open sides of the tent, the amazed pair saw what<br/>appeared to be a highly localized windstorm suddenly forming a tightly<br/>compacted whirling tunnel of air and flame. Rising up like a flaming<br/>dragon of legend, it pierced the overcast and reached high into the<br/>upper levels of the atmosphere. The drifting toxic clouds were<br/>consumed by the raging monster of storm and fire and dissipated many<br/>tens of thousands of feet in the air, far above where any civilians<br/>would be immediately threatened. Better still, it was doubtful the<br/>toxic gases would still remain a threat after passing through the<br/>thousand plus degree inferno, the temperature scale shown by infrared<br/>satellite image didn't go that high. It would be like the<br/>incinerators commonly used to dispose of such toxic chemicals, only on<br/>a huge scale.<p>"There." the self satisfied but weary voice crackled over the speakers<br/>again, barely heard over the howling wind in the background. "That'll<br/>last as long as the fire here holds out. From the look of those oil<br/>tanks, that's several days at least."<p>The beacons on screen soon began moving again. The watching doctors<br/>could see a trail of med beacons being left as more patients were<br/>found in the ruined industrial complex, several being moved further<br/>away from the massive storm. The two doctors in the tent watched in<br/>shock until they were interrupted by group of panicked local<br/>authorities, demanding to know what had just happened.<p>***<p>Days later, our pair of heros lounged, exhausted, in the command<br/>tent. The two of them had managed to retain some degree of bodily<br/>contact since their return, even while wolfing down a huge stack of<br/>sandwiches and seeming gallons of coffee. Even now they had scooted<br/>the chairs they slumped in next to each other, and had intertwined<br/>their arms.<p>The two were regarded by an also tired Dr. Føllesdal, although not<br/>nearly to the same extent. He was actually coherent as he briefed the<br/>pair. "The disaster relief is well underway, all our patients are all<br/>released or under care in the local hospitals, the chemical threat is<br/>ended and the fire has been contained." He got a brief mischievous<br/>look. "Remarkably, the rioting ended shortly after some unique<br/>weather phenomena ended the chemical threat. I understand that many<br/>of the local populace view this as divine intervention." He paused to<br/>see what, if any, reaction would be forthcoming.<p>Upon receiving no reaction, he continued, "The rest of us start<br/>packing our equipment tomorrow, to return to Geneva." He paused<br/>again to see if this would get a rise out of the pair.<p>Nabiki cracked open one bloodshot eye and looked at him. "The rest of<br/>us ?" she croaked. Ranma indicated some small level of alertness with<br/>a grunt in the administrators direction.<p>"Yes, the rest of us. After the two of you catch up on the sleep you<br/>have refused to take the last several days, you are going to go on<br/>vacation, with these." He slid a pair of letters down the table to<br/>the pair. "It is mine and Dr's Inkwazi's and Hong's opinion that the<br/>two of you have admirably fulfilled your residency requirements,<br/>despite the shortened time frame. These letters are our certification<br/>of this. I have already spoken with your Japanese certification<br/>agency. They seemed to be already familiar with you. They promised<br/>to forward the appropriate certifications as soon as they received<br/>copies of these letters, which I have already sent."<p>"Further, neither of you have taken any time off since you started<br/>with us. After talking to your Japanese authorities, it seems you may<br/>not have rested for the past six years. Starting the day after<br/>tomorrow, I expect to not see or hear from either of you for the next<br/>three months. Relax and enjoy yourselves, if you still know how.<br/>Nurse Tendo, if you could detangle yourself, I wish to speak with<br/>Dr. Saotome a moment. Go shower, I will not keep him here long."<p>By now, Nabiki had opened both eyes, first in shock that their last<br/>certification requirements had been completed so quickly, and not by<br/>her, and secondly in reaction to, a, a, vacation ? Whatever would<br/>they do on a vacation ? Her brain not working, Nabiki's mouth<br/>responded on autopilot. "Leave this pervert ? You're kidding, right<br/>? I can't do that. Who knows what trouble he'd get into. Probably<br/>change sexes and try to use the women's shower again or something."<p>The big doctor looked at her with a fatherly gaze. "Please Nabiki, I<br/>only need a moment, and it's important."<p>Evenually responding, Nabiki gradually arose in a shock and fatigue<br/>induced daze, clutched her and Ranma's letters, and shuffled out,<br/>casting a lost and alone look back at Ranma.<p>When Ranma arose in concern and no less fatigue in response to<br/>Nabiki's expression, Dr. Føllesdal stepped forward and stopped the<br/>young man. "She'll be alright, Ranma. I'll send you to her shortly."<br/>Even so, Ranma watched her until she was met by another of the team's<br/>nurses, who supported Nabiki walking toward the makeshift showers and<br/>barracks that had been set up.<p>When Ranma finally turned back, the stocky Norwegian continued, his<br/>use of first names an indication non-professional matters. "Ranma, as<br/>a friend and a mentor, I have a bit of personal advice, if you would."<br/>He looked seriously at the young man before him until Ranma nodded.<p>"Have you given thought to the relationship between yourself and<br/>Nabiki ? The two of you have grown perhaps more attached than you<br/>admit. I recommend that you consider a formal arrangement of some<br/>kind between you. You are already as or more intimate than a married<br/>couple in every way excepting sex. At least I assume that last to be<br/>the case. No, wait, don't interrupt, it doesn't matter what you may<br/>or may not have done together. I merely wish to see two people of<br/>whom I have grown fond have as much comfort as they may. Given your<br/>lifestyle, you should take what chance you have to be together."<p>Turning away, he indicated the interview was over. "Regardless, enjoy<br/>yourselves Ranma. DongEn, you can come in now, Ranma and I are done."<p>As the stumbling Ranma was lead wearily away by his chinese colleague,<br/>only a single thought ran through his dazed mind. "Nabiki and Me ?<br/>Married ?"<p>*** Authors Notes<p>Almost done with this story, only one more chapter to go. Reviews<br/>seem to have petered out, however. Is anyone reading this ? Is there<br/>interest in me finishing ? Let me know.
