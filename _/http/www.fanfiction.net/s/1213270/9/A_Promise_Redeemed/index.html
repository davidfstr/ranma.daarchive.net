</div>Chapter 09 - Redemption<p>"Ranma ! Nabiki ! Over here !"<p>Ranma and Nabiki cleared the customs doorway of the Honolulu<br/>International Airport and looked for the origin of the call.<p>A bouncy well endowed Chinese woman with unusual long lavender hair<br/>peaking out from under a baseball cap waved from where she stood<br/>balanced on the back of a row of airport seats. This was, of course,<br/>Shampoo, but if you hadn't seen her in the past six years you might be<br/>forgiven for mistaking her for someone else. For one thing, she spoke<br/>fluent english. For another, she wasn't wearing her prior outfit de<br/>rigueur of a silk chinese dress or pantsuit. Instead, a pair of tight<br/>cutoff jean shorts and t-shirt with the bottom torn off covered<br/>glimpses of a bikini. A pair of aviator glasses perched atop the cap<br/>and a set of sturdy hiking boots completed the ensemble. Shampoo had<br/>grown a few more inches and a radiant tan during the past years, while<br/>loosing none of her curvaceousness.<p>If more confirmation of Shampoo's identity was needed, it could be had<br/>with the simple expedient of looking at the person behind her.<br/>Whatever the changes in Shampoo had been, Mousse hadn't changed. He<br/>still work his long sleeve white robes, still had long silky black<br/>hair, and still had cokebottle bottom glasses. Well, okay, he had<br/>changed a little. He actually wore the glasses now, and had filled<br/>out and broadened a little as well. He looked ridiculously<br/>overdressed for Hawaii.<p>On catching sight of the pair, Ranma's face broke into a smile.<br/>Holding Nabiki's hand he threaded a graceful path through the crowds.<br/>"Shampoo, Mousse ! It's good to see you !" Hugs and handshakes were<br/>exchanged all around. "Been keeping in practice, I see. Good ! We<br/>need some more sparring partners !"<p>"Thanks for offering to put us up on vacation here. We really didn't<br/>want to stay in Nermia after the first couple of days disaster with<br/>our parents, and didn't really have anywhere else to go." Nabiki<br/>found Ranma's hand again with one of hers and gestured with the other.<p>"No problem. When I got the note from Great Grandmother saying you<br/>needed someplace to go, I was happy too help. It's also our duty<br/>since Great Grandmother adopted you into the tribe. Besides, you've<br/>fallen into the right company here. I'm running my own charter<br/>touring company with Mousse for the rich Americans and Japanese who<br/>vacation here. Mousse and I can show you all the sights. I even have<br/>my own helicopter now. It's a blast. Better than landing my bicycle<br/>on you, even." Shampoo laughs in memory, and Mousse grimaces.<p>"That's great ! We really have no idea what to do with ourselves<br/>right now, and we're not supposed to go back for another 13 weeks. So<br/>anyway, what brought you to Hawaii, of all places ? I would have<br/>guessed you would go back home to the village after you left Nermia.<br/>Elder Cologne never told us."<p>"Since when have you stopped calling Great Grandmother 'old ghoul',<br/>Ranma ? And your English is a lot more polished than what I remember<br/>your Japanese. Looks like ours isn't the only story. Let's get your<br/>luggage, and we can talk on the way, or tomorrow. There's no hurry,<br/>after all. We'll use my chopper to get home over on Lanai island.<br/>You'll like it, there's a lot less people there."<p>"Don't worry about luggage. We're carrying everything already."<br/>Nabiki responds. "You know, your english is pretty good, too. And<br/>when did you get helicopter of your own ? That's impressive. Where's<br/>it at ?"<p>Mousse and Shampoo look at the two small bags carried by Ranma and<br/>Nabiki. "That's all your luggage ?" asks Mousse. "I should have known<br/>you'd still have to better me, Saotome. You didn't have to start<br/>practicing hidden weapons, too."<p>"Mousse, be nice. They just might not have brought much, you know."<br/>Shampoo reproves. "Besides, you only carry that training potty in<br/>your robes for pride's sake."<p>"Well, actually, I'm afraid it's a bit of both." Ranma admits. "We do<br/>use your technique a lot, but we just didn't bring much this trip. We<br/>really never got much in the way of casual clothing. Hey, maybe you<br/>can give us some tips on that technique while we're here. Some of the<br/>stuff we normally carry gets pretty uncomfortable."<p>Chattering happily, or in Mousses case following grumpily, the old<br/>friends make their way out of the terminal.<p>***<p>Gentle tropical sunlight peeked past the curtains of the guestroom<br/>Ranma was using, slowly illuminating the western style bed. Sometime<br/>during the night, Nabiki had crept into bed with him again. He was<br/>never certain who she did that for, anymore, but he didn't mind in the<br/>least. It'd been a long time since he had last jumped out of bed in<br/>shock and dumped her on the floor, and he'd been waking up in strange<br/>places for a couple of years, now, so that didn't bother him.<br/>Nevertheless, a different sort of panic attack happened. 'Oh shit !<br/>We way overslept ! Gotta get going or else ...' Ranma's mind<br/>sputtered here. What did they have to do ? They always had to do<br/>something, didn't they ?<p>Occupied by this conundrum, Ranma's mind didn't censor his hands like<br/>normal, and he absently started stroking Nabiki's hair. Eventually,<br/>he recalled Mousse and Shampoo the night before telling them to relax<br/>and sleep themselves out. "Elder Cologne's orders," Shampoo had<br/>smirked. They had mentioned something about having a charter flight<br/>that morning, but said that they'd be back in the afternoon.<p>Finally realizing the amazing fact that they had nothing they had to<br/>do, Ranma turned his attention back to the beautiful young woman<br/>snuggled next to him. 'Beautiful ? Where did that come from ? Maybe<br/>Hallfreid's little speech effected me more than I thought.' he<br/>ruminated. 'This is Nabiki. The person who made me hurt Ukyo and<br/>Shampoo, and, well, freed me from from my parents and the fiance<br/>situation; and wouldn't let me join Akane, and well, she gave me<br/>another reason to live; and she drove me like a slave for years, but<br/>together we've accomplished more than I ever thought possible; she's<br/>used me for cheap thrills and sold me, even sold my curse for study,<br/>but ever since Akane's passing she's always been here for me, more<br/>than anyone has ever done, even Mom or Pops. Ah geez, I gotta admit I<br/>do like her. Maybe even l, l, love her. Akane, what'm'I gonna do now<br/>?' Ranma breaks off his thoughts, shaking his head in his confusion.<p>Nabiki finally stirs and wakes, gradually woken by Ranma's increasing<br/>activity. Ranma finds his thoughts derailed by a pair of expressive<br/>chocolate brown eyes gazing into his. It was funny to see the same<br/>initial confusion in Nabiki's expression. "Ranma, why are we still in<br/>bed ? Don't we have to, uuhh, what do we have to do this morning ?"<p>Ranma laughed, and for the first time in years, relaxed.<p>***<p>"So I decided to stay here when I found out that the rains and ocean<br/>are typically warm enough to not trigger my curse. That's why Mousse<br/>and I never bothered with those crazy boxes you sent us. Mousse, of<br/>course, stuck with me like a barnacle." Shampoo grimaces as fire light<br/>dashes across her features in the secluded beach cove. The remnants<br/>of a Saotome sized feast lay decimated in front of them.<p>"Shampoo my love, that's not fair !" whined Mousse across the fire<br/>from her.<p>"Quiet you. You're a good tour guide, but how many times do I have to<br/>say I don't love you ! Oh yeah, Nabiki, the other reason, as you've<br/>found out, is that the surfing is great ! It's as much a blast as<br/>flying !"<p>"Yeah, I love it ! Only, how did you get so tan ? With all the ki<br/>manipulation and self healing techniques Ranma and Elder Cologne have<br/>shown me, it doesn't seem like I can even burn anymore, much less<br/>tan." Nabiki pouts from her own barnacle like position by Ranma's<br/>side.<p>"Oh, you can selectively turn it off with a little concentration.<br/>I'll show you the trick tomorrow," a half tanned Ranma wearing only a<br/>pair of swim trunks puts down his last plate and stretches. He, too,<br/>had stopped wearing his anti-curse box some while ago, after failing<br/>to have need of it even once since they arrived. "Ah, that was great<br/>!" he sighs and leans back against his own surfboard, holding open his<br/>arm for Nabiki, who promptly takes advantage to snuggle.<p>"So tell me, what's been up with everyone back in Japan ? I haven't<br/>heard much since Elder Cologne moved back home" asked Shampoo.<br/>"Except from Ryoga, that is. Somehow he manages to show up here every<br/>so often."<p>"Yeah, he does that to us, too. I still haven't figured out how he<br/>does it. I mean, I've met him literally half way around the globe in<br/>the space of a week," Ranma shakes his head in amazement.<p>Shampoo and Mousse look at Ranma.<p>Nabiki picks up the narration with a slight frown. "Well, let's see,<br/>we didn't know to much about what was happening back home ourselves<br/>until we started this vacation. We tried to spend at least a while at<br/>home, but Ukyo and Kasumi are the only ones we could stand to be<br/>around."<p>Shampoo and Mousse look at Nabiki.<p>"Ukyo eventually accepted an offer to be adopted into the Saotome<br/>clan, which means a formal end to the feud and engagement. That and I<br/>still get to see her, which is great. She's still cooking<br/>okonomiyaki, but now Mom sees her as her responsibility, and is trying<br/>to set her up with just about anything on two legs," Ranma matches<br/>Nabiki's expression with his own frown.<p>Shampoo and Mousse look at Ranma.<p>"Kasumi's doing great, too," Nabiki takes up her own part of the<br/>story. "She says she was inspired by us, and is in medical school<br/>herself, now. The same one we went to." She giggles. "She says the<br/>faculty there is a little put off by a normal Tendo."<p>"Anyway, Ranma's parents and Daddy all moved in together, so Ranma's<br/>mother could take care of them," Nabiki continued.<p>Shampoo and Mousse look at Nabiki.<p>"And that seems to have allowed the two old men to get even more<br/>stupid, if that's possible," Ranma smoothly interjects. "We hadn't<br/>been home more than 30 seconds, literally, when they started in about<br/>getting a priest, calling it a matter of honor. They only stopped<br/>when Mom 'reminded' me that I should by rights be carrying the Saotome<br/>honor blade instead of her. Apparently dumb and dumber forgot that<br/>I'm clan head, again."<p>Shampoo and Mousse look at Ranma.<p>"Of course, that just meant they tried the 'subtle' approach. Those<br/>two's idea of subtle was to try to steal our clothes and lock us into<br/>a room together." Nabiki bypasses giggling and passes straight into<br/>laughter for a second. "Not that Ranma's Mom was any better. I<br/>swear, the suggestions that woman tried to pass off on me about her<br/>'manly' son. And I thought he was a pervert."<p>Shampoo and Mousse look at Nabiki.<p>"Who else ? Oh, yeah, the Kunos." It was Ranma's turn again. "Kuno<br/>was pissed that he hadn't heard from his 'pigtailed girl', although<br/>that ditzy ex-cheerleader Mariko kept him from attacking me more than<br/>once a day. Feh - the one time I've regretted my Hippocratic oath.<br/>'Do No Harm', it says. I'd like to see Hippocrates deal with Kuno<br/>before saying that again."<p>Shampoo and Mousse look at Ranma.<p>"Come on Ranma, it wasn't that bad. It was almost fun charging him to<br/>call someone to come and pick him up afterward, for old times sake."<p>Shampoo and Mousse look at Nabiki.<p>"Anyway, it was all driving us nuts. So we were really glad to get<br/>Elder Cologne's message suggesting that we come and visit you two.<br/>Thank God the Kuno's didn't hear we were coming here"<p>Shampoo and Mousse look at Ranma.<p>"Um, " Mousse's neck appears to be stuck from following too many<br/>conversational volleys, "do you two do that often ?"<p>"Do what ?" Ranma and Nabiki respond in perfect chorus, sporting<br/>identical blank looks. Shampoo slowly falls over backwards. Mousse<br/>only works at trying to unstick his neck.<p>"Do you have any idea what that's about ?" Nabiki whispers to Ranma.<p>"Not a thing. Maybe it's some weird Amazon thing. I hope it's<br/>nothing we have to learn," he whispers back. Speaking up, Ranma<br/>changes the topic. "So, who's up for a little sparring to work off<br/>that meal? Mousse, Shampoo, wanna try a little two on one ?"<p>"Hah ! Saotome, you shall never defeat the two of us together !"<br/>Mousse cries as, neck finally fixed, he accepts the invitation and<br/>leaps to his feet, robes billowing around him.<p>Nabiki sighs unhappily for a moment as Ranma slides away from her,<br/>dodging the opening barrage of, of, pineapples (!) Mousse pulls from<br/>his robes. 'Well, this Hawaii.' she shrugs. 'Just so long as he<br/>doesn't pull a Kuno.' And even though she knew how it was done and<br/>employed the same trick herself, it was still amazing to watch Shampoo<br/>produce her trademark bonborii from within her one piece swimming suit<br/>as she too, grinned and leaped at Ranma.<p>Gathering her knees to her chest, Nabiki smiles as she watches Ranma<br/>in action. Even though she could tell that Ranma was holding back<br/>quite a lot, he was grace and power personified. Ranma seemed to fade<br/>in and out of the long shadows of the bright moon and fire, seemingly<br/>barely redirecting Mousse or Shampoos' attack, but always with dire<br/>results for the attacker, sending them flying uncontrollably through<br/>the night sky.<p>The last couple of weeks had been wonderful. It took them a while to<br/>be able to relax and let go, but Elder Cologne's advice had been<br/>right. The relaxed attitude, lack of pressure, and no schedule had<br/>been just what they needed. For the first time in years, Nabiki had<br/>time enough to think about herself and review her life, without<br/>pressure, without worrying about Ranma, and without being driven<br/>herself by the memory of Akane. It was eye opening. 'I'm not sure<br/>when it happened, but I love him', she admits to herself, broadening<br/>her smile. 'I don't know if I helped him or he helped me more, just<br/>by being there. I just know I don't want to even consider being<br/>without him anymore. Akane, I hope this is okay with you, little<br/>sister.'<p>At that moment, she was forced to roll sideways to dodge a spray of<br/>sand thrown up by Shampoo's face. "Looks like you could use some<br/>help, Shampoo," Nabiki offered as she gave Shampoo a hand up.<p>"Aiyaa ! I mean, yes ! I thought he was a doctor ! How in the world<br/>did he get so good ?"<p>Together, the two friends jumped back into the fray. After some time,<br/>Ranma was finally cornered between the three of them, unwilling to use<br/>any of his more destructive moves, especially on Nabiki.<p>"Gotcha you baka pervert !" crowed Nabiki, completing a throw of her<br/>own.<p>"No, wait, don't throw me into the iiicccceee !" Ranma-chan sputters<br/>as she extracts her head from the ice bucket, severely embarrassing<br/>Mousse at the sight of her bare chest.<p>"See, I said you were a pervert, Ranma !" Nabiki and Shampoo<br/>collapse in laughter, ending the sparring for the night.<p>***<p>Late that night, Ranma and Nabiki lay under the stars in the warm<br/>sand. Nabiki is deeply asleep with her head on his shoulder. Ranma<br/>ponders, one hand in his pocket, holding tightly onto something small.<br/>'Akane, I do love her. I'm sorry. What do I do Akane ? What do I do<p>Overhead, in the brilliant night time river of stars, a streak of<br/>light suddenly flashes a brilliant path. Ranma slowly nods,<br/>accepting. At peace, he wraps his arm around Nabiki, and he too falls<br/>asleep.<p>***<p>Shampoo, in her now typical garb of cut offs, shortened t-shirt,<br/>baseball cap and aviator glasses, points out the window of her<br/>helicopter. "There it is, Kilauea Volcano."<p>Mousse takes over the narration in a practiced tour guide voice,<br/>speaking over the headset microphone and bug like headphones which<br/>allowed them to hear each other over the noise of the helicopter.<br/>"The volcano has been erupting steadily since 1983. It sends up<br/>130,000 gallons of lava a minute. Over 550 acres of land have been<br/>added to Hawaii island by this volcano."<p>"Rivers of lava from this volcano has consumed over 181 homes, a<br/>church, and a community center."<p>"We'll land just outside Volcano village, and catch a bus along crater<br/>rim road, and up to the crater overlook."<p>Ranma and Nabiki plaster themselves to the windows appreciatively,<br/>dressed in matching outfits of shorts, t-shirts and sneakers. Seeing<br/>the glowing lava spurt into the air, Ranma lets loose a long,<br/>impressed whistle. "I wonder how big of a Hiryu Shoten Ha whirlwind I<br/>could make with that as a source of heat ?"<p>Shampoo twitches, causing the helicopter to jerk momentarily.<p>"Don't you even dare, Ranma," Nabiki slaps him gently. "Do you want<br/>red hot lava scattered all over the island ? And how in the world<br/>would you turn it off ?"<p>"Ow ! Sheesh ! Can't you people take a joke ?"<p>Shampoo recovers and circles the crater another time before breaking<br/>off to approach Volcano village. As the near the village, a tour buss<br/>can be seen leaving the village and driving up the switchbacks on<br/>crater rim road.<p>Nabiki spots it first. She points to a spot of otherwise unremarkable<br/>rock south and west of the village, near the edge of the greenery.<br/>"Is that rock bulging there, or am I seeing things ?"<p>All eyes track the location that Nabiki points in. "You know, I think<br/>you're right", Mousse starts a response, but does not finish. The<br/>goddess Pele has come again to destroy and build the land.<p>A literally earth shaking rumble splits the air, audible even above<br/>the rotors and engine of the helicopter. The light helicopter itself<br/>is thrown skyward by a blast of air as rock and lava spew explosively<br/>from the new brother to Halema'uma'u crater. From an aerial viewpoint,<br/>concentric circles of earth and dust can be seen thrown up by as the<br/>shockwave travels outward.<p>Miraculously, the small helicopter escapes being struck by the flying<br/>debris. Shampoo is forced to use every bit of her highly trained<br/>reflexes to bring the small craft again under control.<p>As the first wave of the explosion passes, however, it can be seen<br/>that the tour bus noticed earlier was not so lucky. A boulder several<br/>feet in size has struck the front of the touring coach, crippling the<br/>vehicle. Ranma, automatically engaging reflexes from the past several<br/>years of rescue work, had immediately started scanning for damage and<br/>sees the crippled coach, caught in the earthquake shockwave, tip on<br/>its side and slide forward and downhill toward the drop off at the next<br/>switchback. The several dozens of kph speed the bus had prior to this<br/>catastrophe now carried it forward uncontrolled toward it's doom.<p>"Shampoo, get us close to that bus, now !" Ranma commanded in a voice<br/>compelling immediate obedience. As Shampoo tips the nose down, he<br/>continues, "Nabiki, how much stuff have ya got ? I'm just carrying a<br/>basic kit, one or two each of the most basic items. I left everything<br/>else at home."<p>As he speaks, Nabiki and Ranma both start reaching out with their<br/>finely developed senses, and something truly remarkable starts to<br/>happen. A true master martial artist develops the near spooky ability<br/>to be able to sense her opponents actions almost before the opponent<br/>themselves knows he is going to make them. The intent of action is<br/>sensed in the opponents ki, and the master can even at times project<br/>his own ki to alter the actions of the opponent, controlling the<br/>timing and pacing of an encounter, or defusing or avoiding it<br/>entirely. If you ever find yourself facing such a master, you will<br/>likely never even notice it happening, you will merely loose, badly.<p>Extended, this ability allows a master to sense nearly all that occurs<br/>around her, by literally sensing the concentration and flow of ki and<br/>intent. Ranma had trained Nabiki well enough that by now they would<br/>both use this trick to locate the victims they sought to treat and<br/>discern which of them would require attention in what order. What<br/>they did not yet realize was that this technique worked with each<br/>other as well. In a crisis (and often normally), they each knew what<br/>the other was doing, what the other intended, and sometimes even<br/>changed the others intent. It effectively allowed them to operate as<br/>a team with unheard of ability and efficiency. They rarely had to<br/>stop and consult the other, they rarely even had to deliberately<br/>communicate with glances, posture or body language. They knew,<br/>without even noticing it, what needed to be done to support the other<br/>at any instant, and simply did it.<p>Highly trained groups of people could, and did, develop this level of<br/>coordination by training in specific actions, for example a team of<br/>professional athletes in a well practiced maneuver. Ranma and Nabiki,<br/>however, could show this level of spooky coordination all the time,<br/>flexibly adopting it to whatever the circumstance demanded.<p>"Not much either. Some plasma and saline that's not out of date, a<br/>few I.V's, and some gauze." Nabiki was already, along with Ranma,<br/>releasing her seatbelt, opening the copter door, and edging onto the<br/>landing skid of the diving helicopter.<p>"It'll have to do. I hate improvising, it uses so much ki. Shampoo,<br/>Mousse, get to the village and send what help you can. We'll be<br/>along as soon as we've secured this."<p>At that, Ranma and Nabiki simultaneously stepped off the helicopter<br/>skid, still well over a hundred feet in the air.<p>Mousse, freed from the task of preventing a head on crash into the<br/>ground which occupied Shampoo, gaped at the sight of Ranma and Nabiki<br/>apparently diving to their deaths, turning head down, no less ! Upon<br/>intercepting the roadway the pair's vertical speed was by some miracle<br/>transformed into a synchronized horizontal roll, so fast that it looked<br/>like large human sized balls rather than people. The ball like blurs<br/>ended with an crashing impact onto the front of the sliding bus, and<br/>resolved into Ranma and Nabiki both pushing against the splintered<br/>front of the bus and digging their feet into the ground, digging huge<br/>parallel grooves in the roadway under their feet. The grooves<br/>disappeared under the front of the bus, and reappeared from underneath<br/>the back as the bus continued to slide forward.<p>How the mass of two people totaling less than 250 kilos made a<br/>difference to the momentum of a multiple thousands of kilo touring<br/>coach was unclear, but apparently it did. The bus could be seen<br/>slowing dramatically. Just before it stopped entirely, safely well<br/>away from the switchback, Ranma slipped to one side and slid one hand<br/>across the length of the buses roof as it passed him. Whatever he did<br/>caused it to open like a can of sardines, split cleanly from front to<br/>back. Nabiki appeared from around the front of the now motionless<br/>vehicle, and Ranma and Nabiki simultaneously grabbed the cut edge of<br/>the roof and peeled it back, rolling it up like a sheet of tinfoil.<p>Wasting no time, both leaped into the revealed interior of the<br/>vehicle, filled with still screaming hapless tourists. Sensing the<br/>only serious injury among the people inside near the front, Ranma<br/>slid impossibly fast to where the driver was still buckled in the<br/>remnants of his seat, bleeding from the shrapnel like glass, metal,<br/>and rock fragments thrown up when the boulder had struck the front of<br/>the coach. A quick swipe with one hand, flickering with some ethereal<br/>energy, released the moaning mass of flesh into Ranma's other arm.<br/>The hand of the catching arm appeared to blur for a moment near the<br/>back of the driver's neck as it caught him, apparently causing the<br/>driver to fall unconscious.<p>Ranma leaped again, the driver in his arms, clearing the bus and<br/>setting the man down on the roadway next to a signpost. Just in time<br/>he raised his hand behind him and caught the I.V. and bag of plasma<br/>Nabiki had lofted on a high parabola toward that spot a second before<br/>Ranma landed, between her leap carrying out two young children and<br/>bound returning to the bus for their elderly grandmother.<p>Suddenly, bloody fragments of improvised shrapnel, some quite small,<br/>started flying off the driver Ranma was kneeling over. The fragments<br/>originated in a wave starting at his head and proceeding toward his<br/>feet, with the tattered remains of the man's clothing peeling back<br/>like an orange. All the fragments landed in a neat little pile a<br/>short distance to the side. During this process, Ranma's arms and<br/>hands were invisible the naked eye. When his hands again resolved<br/>themselves into visibility, like a CGI movie effect, the I.V. was<br/>magical attached to the driver's arm and the plasma bag, now hung from<br/>the signpost, was attached to the I.V.<p>Ranma paused for just long enough to insure that the unconscious driver<br/>was breathing freely before joining Nabiki in evacuating the remaining<br/>two thirds of the passengers. Any passenger not caught up in shock<br/>might have noticed that driver was no longer bleeding and had a<br/>sparing amount of gauze covering the worst of his wounds, which were<br/>sutured shut. The man was squeaky clean, and a close examination of<br/>the smaller visible wounds would have shown them to be uniformly and<br/>cleanly cauterized, as if by the precise application of measured<br/>amounts of heat or energy.<p>Seconds later, the evacuation of the bus was complete. None of the<br/>other passengers had suffered worse than a mild concussion or<br/>contusion, and Ranma had already eased these noticeably, apparently by<br/>the simple expedient of a touch. Even more remarkably, the passengers<br/>as a whole had ceased to panic, each in turn turning calm as she or he<br/>was carried out of the ruined vehicle by Nabiki or Ranma.<p>As the flurry of action surrounding the coach had all happened in less<br/>than a minutes time, the small helicopter above them was still clawing<br/>out of it's hawk like dive. Finally leveling out, Shampoo turned her<br/>attention to the pillar of smoke rising from the new crater, not<br/>wanting her helicopter to suffer a repeat of the tour bus's fate.<br/>What she saw froze her blood. Glancing down, she saw that somehow,<br/>while she had been otherwise occupied, Ranma and Nabiki had apparently<br/>stopped the runaway coach, split it asunder, and evacuated all the<br/>people inside. Mousse was staring openmouthed at the scene below,<br/>apparently in shock. His shock turned to horror when Shampoo prodded<br/>him and pointed out what she had seen.<p>Making a decision, Shampoo turned around and directed her flight to<br/>pass again low over the bus. Turning on her small P.A. system and<br/>boosting the volume to it's maximum as she approached, she called out,<br/>gaining the attention of those on the ground. "Ranma, Nabiki, the new<br/>lava flow. It's huge, fast, and it's heading for the town."<p>Nabiki instantly turned toward Ranma, and as the helicopter passed low<br/>over the bus to fast to enter a hover or land, she leaped, receiving a<br/>boost from Ranma which placed the apex of her remarkably leap just<br/>below the whirling rotor and straight into the still open door Mousse<br/>had been in too much shock to close. Before she even stopped moving,<br/>one of her hands had darted into the sleeve of Mousses robe and<br/>reappeared with one of his chains, causing a cute duck like squawk of<br/>protest a few seconds later. Before he reacted, however, the chain<br/>was flung instantly out and down to where Ranma, at the apex of his<br/>own leap from ground to bus to air, was barely able to grab it. She<br/>extended the hand not holding the chain in time to catch Ranma's arm<br/>as he shot through the open door himself, pulling up the chain he had<br/>hung from, and finally closing the door.<p>Picking up and slipping his headset on, Ranma reaches over Shampoo and<br/>turns off the P.A. "Can we reach the lava flow before it hits the<br/>town ?" he demands of the shocked woman.<p>Thousands of years of selective breeding for warriors and a lifetime<br/>of training allow Shampoo to react, despite the sudden shock of<br/>Nabiki, then Ranma appearing behind her while still in mid-air.<br/>"We'll try". She again turns her helicopter, tips the small craft<br/>forward, opens the engine throttle, and increases the lift generated<br/>by the main rotor. Shortly, the tiny craft is racing toward the<br/>village at over 200 knots just above tree top level.<p>"Mousse, contact air traffic control and raise a mayday. Make certain<br/>the people from that bus aren't forgotten about, either. They'll need<br/>evacuation before the new lava flow might change direction. Shampoo,<br/>bring me right over the head of the lava flow, fly Nabiki over the<br/>village, then land and do the best you can to help out, okay ?"<p>In moments the small craft comes in sight of the village. Much damage<br/>is visible in the village, from both the initial explosion of rubble,<br/>and the accompanying earthquake. Small fires are burning in several<br/>locations, several buildings are collapsed, and the earth seems to<br/>have shifted underneath it, opening up a few crevices obviously not<br/>there before. Even worse, a massive wall of bright red glowing<br/>viscous rock drops down the mountain side toward the hapless village,<br/>cresting like one of the waves the group had been surfing the day<br/>before and moving faster than a normal man could run.<p>Nabiki turns a worried gaze at Ranma. "You're not seriously going to<br/>try a Hiryu Shoten Ha, are you ?"<p>"Nah, too bad, though." Ranma grins back. "I would have liked to try<br/>making lava powered whirlwind. Too risky, though. This is gonna be a<br/>bit harder."<p>As the helicopter passes near the lava front, Ranma again drops his<br/>headset, opens the door, and flings himself toward the still open<br/>ground in front of the massive wave of destruction. A blast of cold<br/>air accompanies his exit. After another death defying dive and roll,<br/>a pillar of deep blue light begins to build around Ranma, standing<br/>seemingly unconcerned in front of the onrushing, incandescent fluid.<p>A huge turbulence pops into nowhere behind the fleeing helicopter, as<br/>superheated air convecting off the lava flow suddenly encounters a<br/>beyond arctic air flow from Ranma. As the wave of lava approaches<br/>Ranma, it suddenly and precipitously looses it's incandescence,<br/>hardening into solid black rock with a deafening cacophony of<br/>poppings and crackings. The sudden cooling effect builds a huge hill<br/>of cooled basalt out of the lava in front of Ranma, and which begins<br/>to grow out to the sides as Ranma approaches and touches the suddenly<br/>created heap of rock to increase the effect. A half circle of<br/>suddenly cold and solid rock extends out from Ranma, building in depth<br/>and in height as the lava flow continues to wash atop it.<p>Panting in effort, Ranma sees that the huge and growing solidification<br/>has begin to divert the deadly flow of lava onto a course that does<br/>not directly intercept the town. 'Just a couple more minutes here.<br/>Gotta make certain this lava dam is solid. Nabiki will have to handle<br/>the town until then. Hmm, that ravine over there, if I can get the<br/>lava into it, we'd have a couple hours at least to deal with the town.<br/>I need a ditch.'<p>Straining even more, Ranma releases one hand from the wall, and splits<br/>his concentration. A brilliant glow begins to coalesce just above<br/>the palm of his free hand, growing in intensity until it outshines the<br/>lava, until it even outshines the sun. Screaming with effort, Ranma<br/>turns the palm of his hand outward, and a brilliant beam of light<br/>springs from his hand, impacting the dirt and rock in front of the<br/>diverting lava flow. A massive explosion seemingly near the size of<br/>the original eruption obscures the lava, and Ranma drags his hand<br/>through the air, walking the explosion in a gentle downhill line out<br/>to the ravine he had noticed, over a quarter mile away.<p>Dropping his hand and falling to knees, Ranma droops his head, panting<br/>in exhaustion, but careful to keep his other hand still attached to<br/>the new basalt cliff in front of him and continue the cooling effect.<br/>Eventually, he is able to raise his gaze and examine his efforts, now<br/>visible in the settling dust. A massive ditch is taking the diverted<br/>lava flow from the end of his improvised dam, and sending it for now<br/>on a harmless course away from habitations. 'Good, it's working.<br/>Now, I gotta get down there and help.'<p>Ranma staggers to his feet and stumbles downhill, panting heavily and<br/>moving, for the moment, only as fast as a normal person.<p>***<p>In the small village, Nabiki exerts her own not inconsiderable skills<br/>to clear away portions of the collapsed visitor center. Apparently, a<br/>second coach of tourists had still been at the center when the<br/>eruption occurred, and many of them were trapped in the collapsed<br/>shelter. Unfortunately, the large sections of roof and wall were too<br/>ungainly for any one person to lift away cleanly, not matter how<br/>strong that person. Lifting a section at one edge merely allowed the<br/>anything more than a few feet away from the lifter to collapse.<br/>Instead, it had to be chewed away at, beaver like, torn off bit by bit<br/>and tossed aside. Great care had to be taken during the process to<br/>insure that the surrounding debris did not collapse more and further<br/>injure a trapped person.<p>Nonetheless, a thick, steady stream of material flew from her hands,<br/>interrupted only briefly whenever she reached another person. The<br/>people she found were quickly given first aid, stabilizing any<br/>injuries, then gently passed to Shampoo or Mousse behind her to be<br/>carried clear of the rubble.<p>Ranma's belated arrival on site heralded an order of magnitude<br/>increase in the speed of the recovery process. By time time he had<br/>made his way down the mountain, Ranma had had a chance to recover to<br/>something approximating his normal speed. Mousse and Shampoo,<br/>therefore, felt the wind raised by his passage before registering him<br/>visually. Even to their trained senses, Ranma still operated at a<br/>high enough level that any difference in his performance was<br/>unnoticeable. To their eyes, he was still an almost untrackable blur.<p>Nabiki, however, could sense the change. Automatically, she<br/>compensated for Ranma as much as she was able, but several of the<br/>feats he performed were simply still beyond her own level of<br/>accomplishment. She could clear unstable debris in minutes by chewing<br/>it away in pieces, Ranma cleared it in mere moments by disintegrating<br/>it whole cloth with measured infusions of ki. She should stabilize a<br/>wounded person, preventing further damage and halting a march toward<br/>death, Ranma could, and did, perform in situ surgery to repair<br/>internal ruptures and bleeding and knitted together torn and damaged<br/>nerves with his own life force to the point where the remaining damage<br/>would heal on it's own.<p>What was worse, not only could she feel Ranma at the ragged edge of<br/>exhaustion, but their normal techniques to extend their endurance<br/>depended on their massive stores of internal ki. Ranma's ki was<br/>nearly exhausted in his battle with the primal forces of nature, and<br/>now he was being forced to make far more extensive use of his ki than<br/>normal due to their lack of equipment. Energy gulping ki claws were<br/>needed in place of scalpels, precisely directed ki generated heat was<br/>used to sterilize instead of standard cleansing solutions, torn blood<br/>vessels had to be cauterized or coaxed and provided energy to<br/>instantaneously heal instead of clamped or sutured, blood producing<br/>marrow had to be similarly supercharged to replace lost cells instead<br/>of using standard units of blood.<p>Ranma, Nabiki knew from past experience, would not slow down until all<br/>of the people present were safe and removed from danger. Neither<br/>would she. She did what she could to help Ranma and compensate for<br/>his unusual weariness. Shampoo and Mousse's efforts were helpful as<br/>well. Today, however, it was not enough.<p>Several years of close calls finally caught up. Pele, avatar of<br/>creation and destruction was awakened yet again. Seemingly annoyed at<br/>the audacity of a human ant impeding her work, the volcano shook<br/>again, and it did so at the worst possible moment.<p>Ranma had just dropped into a small narrow gorge cut into the rocky<br/>ground by the first earthquake and eruption. At the bottom, a scared<br/>and hurt child was trapped underneath a splintered tree. With the<br/>little girl clinging to his neck, he had just crouched to leap when<br/>the aftershock struck. The combination of exhaustion and moving earth<br/>caused Ranma to stumble just as the tree he had tossed aside fell back<br/>down and the rocky edges of the ravine crumbled inward. At the last<br/>possible moment, Ranma threw the child upward, clear of the debris<br/>falling in on him. Like a great closing mouth, the vengeful earth<br/>consumed him, driving jagged shafts of splintered palm wood into him,<br/>and crushing him beneath shards of heavy sharp black rock.<p>Nabiki automatically fields the falling child, despite the still<br/>shaking ground. Something is wrong, however. Why did Ranma throw the<br/>little girl up instead of carry her ?<p>The feeling of wrongness continues to nag her as she calms and treats<br/>the child. The young one was almost the last person needing immediate<br/>attention, she could only feel one other person with serious injury.<br/>Mousse and Shampoo could probably handle freeing the last few<br/>uninjured but still trapped people.<p>Setting down the child with her pretty dark haired older sister and<br/>dog (what a strange looking dog, were dogs supposed to have 6 legs and<br/>be blue ?), the feeling of wrongness snapped into sharp focus. The ki<br/>signature of the remaining serious injury felt familiar, far too<br/>familiar, in fact. As weak as it was, it had taken her a moment to<br/>recognize it, but it was Ranma's, and it was fading.<p>Oh dear God, not Ranma. Please.<p>Moving faster than she had ever moved before, even with all of her<br/>prior training, Nabiki found herself tearing at the earth, stone and<br/>wood of a collapsed ravine like a demon possessed, with no idea how<br/>she had covered the intervening distance. Right then she would have<br/>given her life for Ryoga's Bakusai Tenketsu technique. Anything to<br/>dig faster. Anything. Dear lord please let him be alright.<p>At that moment, in one of those cosmic coincidences which prove that<br/>there is a God, Nabiki's prayer was answered. A voice in Japanese is<br/>heard to mutter nearby, "Where in the world am I now ? I didn't think<br/>the Serengeti had any volcanoes."<p>"Ryoga ! Thank God ! I need your help ! Ranma's trapped ! Please<br/>!" Nabiki turns and screams in a voice made raw with sulfur and<br/>terror.<p>"Nabiki ? " Ryoga momentarily has to retreat a step from Nabiki's<br/>vehemence. He was closer than she had known. Following the direction<br/>of her shaking finger though, he immediately discerned the problem.<br/>Jumping into the hole Nabiki had started, he touches his finger to the<br/>earth and mutters. The earth answers him with an explosion of flying<br/>rock and dirt. Ryoga touches the earth again, and again, and yet<br/>again, each time answered by a cloud of flying earth. Gently, he<br/>reaches for the body now exposed, and leaps out of the far deeper<br/>hole, setting Ranma's unconscious form down near Nabiki.<p>Years of professional exposure to trauma somehow allow Nabiki to<br/>operate through her panic. Frantically, she tries to keep Ranma<br/>alive. Dear lord this is bad. Ranma's femoral artery is sliced open<br/>by a spear of wood high up on one thigh, he has several broken ribs<br/>driving into one lung, collapsing it, and she'd swear there's internal<br/>bleeding as well. Fortunately, she can tourniquet the artery, it's<br/>just low enough for her to be able to slip a coil of I.V. line above<br/>it, and she still has a breathing tube and hand respirator left, and a<br/>unit of plasma. Enough to keep him alive, she prays.<p>Shampoo and Mousse both have heard Nabiki's scream, and come a soon as<br/>they are able. Seeing them, Nabiki cradles Ranma and makes her shaky<br/>demands. "Mousse, squeeze the respirator, slowly and evenly, and hold<br/>up the plasma bag. Shampoo, please, fly us to the hospital. There's<br/>one in Hilo, right ? That's only 40 kilometers ... he can last until<br/>then, he _can_ last until then."<p>Shampoo nods and runs ahead to start the engine on her bird, followed<br/>by Nabiki and Mousse, forced to move more slowly by the demands of the<br/>unfamiliar coordination between them. "Ryoga, thank you. I owe you.<br/>Can you please help out the last few people needing it here, and then<br/>meet us in Hilo later ?"<p>Ryoga also nods and turns back to the town, prepared to search it for<br/>anyone else in need of help. By now, the police, fire, and ambulance<br/>services were arriving from whatever the next major population center<br/>was, probably the Hilo Nabiki had mentioned. Stepping forward, he is<br/>caught by surprise by a small, cute, hexapedal dog, who catches his<br/>leg in an impossibly strong grip, improbably smiles, and somehow,<br/>talks. "Stitch help you." Oh well, this was less weird than the last<br/>time he had run into that Djinn in Antarctica.<p>***<p>A rumpled doctor speaks to a small group of medical staff in the<br/>emergency receiving room of the local hospital. "Thanks for answering<br/>your pagers so promptly. It hasn't hit the news yet, but I think you<br/>can all see what happened." A nervous chuckle sweeps around the room<br/>at the plume of smoke easily visible out the window of the hospital<br/>emergency room. "We're starting to get radio reports from Volcano<br/>Village, and initially, it doesn't look as bad as it could be.<br/>Nevertheless, it looks like we'll have any number of patients in the<br/>near future. We don't have time for much preparation, does everyone<br/>know what to do ?"<p>"That's strange," he breaks off as he hears a helicopter approaching<br/>the hospital landing pad. "I didn't think we'd be seeing someone this<br/>early. Why didn't we get a call ahead on this ?" Gathering a pair of<br/>hefty nurses and a gurney, the doctor dismisses the rest of the staff<br/>to their preparations, and proceeds quickly to the helipad.<p>He is greeted by the sight of a small private helicopter, not a<br/>medical one, emblazoned with the words 'Nihou Tours'. Through the<br/>cockpit window he can see the pilot is a young chinese woman with a<br/>baseball cap covering a mane of highly unusual lavender hair. He<br/>turns his attention to the opening passenger door of the aircraft with<br/>a snort for the odd preferences of youth. First out is a tall chinese<br/>man with long black hair wearing a robe far too heavy for the weather.<br/>He is holding a half empty plasma bag aloft, and doing something with<br/>his other hand not visible through the door. He is followed by a<br/>short brown haired Japanese woman who carefully climbs out of the<br/>helicopter cradling an obviously injured japanese man. It can now be<br/>seen that the chinese man is rhythmically squeezing the ball of a<br/>manual respirator.<p>The surgeon pushes aside his thoughts at the odd appearance of the<br/>group and moves to help put the injured man on the gurney. The woman<br/>is obviously a health professional of some sort and quickly gives him<br/>an update of the patients condition, in an albeit shaky voice,<br/>supplementing his own quick professional examination. "Prep the<br/>surgery for this one, Ann. Grab Dr. Angles on the way. I'll scrub<br/>and be right in."<p>Something clicks in his mind as he turns back to quickly reassure the<br/>woman following him. "Excuse me, but is your name Nabiki Tendo, by<br/>any chance ?"<p>Seeing Nabiki's nod, he suddenly blurts out "Oh my God. Then that was<br/>Ranma Saotome ? I don't believe it. You two are famous !" Despite<br/>his age and professionalism, the doctor suddenly feels like a giddy<br/>first year medical student again. "Wow, I guess that explains why<br/>there are no serious calls coming in from Volcano village."<p>"Doctor, please, Ranma ..." Nabiki manages to force out, grabbing the<br/>mans arm like a life preserver with her left hand, her right hand<br/>seems to be squeezing something. "Then you know about his curse ?"<br/>She finally manages. "If he should change size dramatically in<br/>mid-procedure ..."<p>The surgeon nods, winces, and disengages his bruised arm. "I know, I<br/>looked up the journal articles on his curse when you two became better<br/>known for your rescue work. Hard to believe, but it was pretty<br/>irrefutable. Too bad the place was destroyed. No cold water, right<br/>?" He smiles reassuringly at her and enters the surgery.<p>With events finally catching up with her, Nabiki collapses bonelessly,<br/>barely caught by Shampoo and Mousse and maneuvered onto a nearby<br/>bench.<p>Softly, brokenly, Nabiki clutches Shampoo and sobs. "Shampoo, oh God,<br/>this is my fault. I made him do this. Was it worth it. Was the last<br/>six years, all that effort worth it, just to see him die anyway ? Oh<br/>please, say he'll be alright, say I did the right thing."<p>"Mousse, what do I do now ?" Shampoo awkwardly cradles her friend and<br/>looks at Mousse pleadingly. "I don't know what to do."<p>***<p>Late that night, withdrawn and pensive in the dark, Nabiki sits beside<br/>the intensive care bed occupied by Ranma. He had been released from<br/>surgery a few hours earlier, but was in a coma and was given an<br/>uncertain prognosis. Illuminated only by the glowing monitors, it can<br/>just be made out that she holds an object in either hand.<p>In her right hand she holds two halves of a small, crushed, and bloody<br/>box. Something in the box glitters as Nabiki moves. It is a gold<br/>ring, with small but elegant diamond placed in it. When Nabiki had<br/>examined the ring in the light of the bathroom, her name could be<br/>clearly seen engraved in the inside of the band, below the name of her<br/>younger sister. Nabiki had found this box in the pocket of Ranma's<br/>shorts when she was dealing with his sliced femoral artery.<p>'I remember this ring. I loaned him the money for it, and helped the<br/>baka pick it out before Jusendo, all those years ago. I don't think<br/>he ever paid me back for it, in fact. But for me ? And why Akane's<br/>ring ? Does this mean little sister approves ?'<p>In her left hand, she carries a ceremonial tanto engraved with the<br/>Saotome family crest. It is the same blade that, all those years ago,<br/>Ranma had made his promise upon.<p>'And this, this, thing. This blade. This has never been welcome to<br/>me. Why did Kasumi give me this when we visited ? She said I might<br/>need it soon. For what ? To atone for my own failures ?'<p>Clenching her fists Nabiki looks at Ranma in dark amusement. "How<br/>long have you been carrying this ring, Saotome ? I guess you still<br/>can't talk to women, can you, baka pervert." Slowly, her mood fades<br/>toward despair. "You can't die on me, you perverted baka, you can't.<br/>If the promise you gave me six years ago on this,' she looks at her<br/>left hand, 'means anything, then you have to survive and give me<br/>this.' she holds up her right.<p>A quiet knock interrupts her revere. "Come in," she says with a small<br/>start.<p>A large figure wearing an oversize traveling backpack is illuminated<br/>against the hall lights. "Wow. I think this is the fastest I've<br/>gotten to anywhere I wanted to go." Ryoga comments. Walking over to<br/>the bed, and seating himself on the other chair, he looks over Ranma,<br/>then Nabiki, and gently asks "How is he doing ?"<p>"He's been in a coma since he got out of surgery. There was a lot of<br/>internal damage. They did what they could, but ..." Nabiki trails<br/>off. "It's ironic, you know, if our situations were reversed I'd<br/>already be walking around, he'd have performed a ki transfer and have<br/>jumpstarted my ki flows. I've seen him do it, and he's started<br/>teaching me, but apparently I just can't summon a sufficient focus for<br/>my ki yet. Not that he'd ever let me get hurt, the jerk." Nabiki<br/>pauses to wipe away some tears.<p>This strikes another, ironic chord in Ryoga, "Heh, deja vue," he says,<br/>as he hands her a tissue. "That sounded a lot like Akane did. Don't<br/>tell me you've fallen for him now, too."<p>Nabiki only sets the tanto down, reaches over, and grasps Ranma's<br/>unresponsive hand. She opens the other, to show Ryoga it's contents,<br/>forbearing to stop or hide the tears now.<p>"Ranma, you still haven't changed, have you." Ryoga smiles softly.<br/>"Not that it matters anymore, but I truly forgive you now. That's<br/>probably why I found you so quickly." He turns to Nabiki and gently<br/>closes her hand again. "I never learned any of the rejuvenation<br/>techniques, and I guess I'm not surprised that he didn't teach you<br/>this way, Nabiki, given what happened to the two of us. But you<br/>should know you've got more than enough focus to use your ki for a<br/>transfer technique."<p>"What ! Tell me ! Please !" Nabiki stumbles up from her chair and<br/>lunges at Ryoga.<p>"Woah there !" Ryoga grunts quietly as he catches her. Some detached<br/>part of Nabiki notes that Ryoga is still more solid and harder to<br/>move even than Ranma.<p>"It's simple enough. I'm surprised you didn't think of this yourself,<br/>you've seen both of us do it enough times. Use your emotion as a<br/>focus. You just need a strong, pure emotion as a focus to use. It's<br/>self destructive in the long term, as he and I found out, but it<br/>works."<p>Nabiki hesitates a second before wrapping her arms around Ryoga and<br/>crying in relief. A short while later, she manages to pull herself<br/>upright, and claiming the tissue she dropped before, cleans her face<br/>ineffectually.<p>She smiles, tentatively and brokenly, but a real smile nonetheless.<br/>"Ryoga, thank you. I owe you more than I can say. Can you, can you<br/>leave us for a bit ? I think Shampoo and Mousse are still in the<br/>lounge down the hall."<p>Ryoga nods and gets up. When he's about to open the door, he hears<br/>Nabiki's voice again, in a reasonable facade of her old ice-queen<br/>persona. "Oh, and Ryoga. This didn't happen, got it ?" They both<br/>share a small laugh as the door closes.<p>Walking down the hall, Ryoga is not surprised to see a gentle warm<br/>rose glow momentarily rise and fall in the window of Ranma's room.<br/>Opening the door of the lounge, sees a sleepy Shampoo and Mousse and<br/>asks. "Hey. Anyone hungry ? By the way, where does Hawaii get those<br/>weird dogs from ?"<p>Back in the intensive care room, various monitors change their quiet<br/>beeps to a more lively, happier rhythm. Slowly, Ranma wakes up.<p>Opening his eyes, he blinks away the gloom and sees Nabiki sitting<br/>beside him, apparently caught half way between laughing and crying.<br/>She seems to have a death grip on his hand.<p>"Biki ? You okay ? Where are we ? Don't cry Biki," mutters a still<br/>groggy Ranma.<p>Nabiki turns her face away for a moment, and with considerable effort,<br/>gains control over her features. Finally turning back, she picks up<br/>an object from the bedtable and places it atop Ranma's lap. "Ranma, I<br/>release you from your promise."<p>"What's that ? What are you talking about Biki ?" Still confused,<br/>Ranma sees that he is in a hospital bed, fitted out with nearly as<br/>many monitors as he used to have to wear back as a guinea pig in med<br/>school.<p>"Ranma, your promise to us, after Jusendo. As a representative of<br/>clan Tendo, I release you. And you know I hate it when you call me<br/>'Biki'."<p>Ranma levers himself painfully upright into a sitting position.<br/>Looking down, Ranma sees that Nabiki has returned to him the tanto so<br/>symbolic of the path his life has taken since Akane. "Biki, um, I<br/>mean Nabiki ? What's wrong ? Why are you doing this ? "<p>"Listen you Baka ! It's over ! You've done enough ! You can quit<br/>now ! You almost died, damn it ! You probably would have if Ryoga<br/>hadn't stumbled along !" Nabiki is shouting now, fist clenched and<br/>eyes flashing. "Don't you dare leave me !"<p>Nabiki's control finally crumbles completely, as she opens her fist<br/>and holds out the ring. "I found this, Ranma. I love you." She can<br/>find nothing more to say.<p>Ranma looks at Nabiki for a moment. Slowly then, Ranma's hand lifts<br/>the ring out of Nabiki's, and places it on her finger. "I won't leave<br/>Nabiki, I promise."<p>He gives a small smile and teases "_Biki_". Nothing more is said as<br/>Ranma falls back asleep.<p>***<p>Authors Notes<p>So, okay this should have been several chapters, it the largest one of<br/>this story by far. Still, it's done. Yay !<p>Credit to Lilo and Stitch for the inspiration to place the story in<br/>Hawaii. I couldn't resist giving the little blue guy a guest<br/>appearance.<p>As I disclaimed before, I'm not a doctor, I don't know medicine. I'm<br/>also not a pilot. I do occasionally pretend to be a martial artist,<br/>and the description I wrote of a master spookily feeling and effecting<br/>his surroundings is pretty close. I've seen myself recorded on video<br/>reacting to my instructors in the way I describe. I didn't realize it<br/>until they pointed it out to me watching the tape. Sparring certain<br/>of my instructors is like trying to spar a ghost, you don't hit them<br/>unless they want you to.
