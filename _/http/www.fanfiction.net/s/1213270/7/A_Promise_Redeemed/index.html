</div>Chapter 07 - Promised Obsession<p>Nabiki stood up from her seat next to Ranma in the lecture hall and<br/>stretched. This lecture class was the last courses they had, and one<br/>of the few bits of course work they were able to still do together.<br/>Their programs had differed significantly over the four years they had<br/>been in school. A glance at the watch peeking out from under the<br/>sleeve of her scrubs showed that they still had a quarter hour to<br/>cross the campus and be to at the hospital where they were serving<br/>their internships.<p>As Ranma got up beside her gathered his notes, she took a moment to<br/>covertly study him while restuffing her notebook into her book-bag.<br/>The intervening years had made considerable changes in him. At 21,<br/>Ranma had broadened and filled out considerably. He still moved with<br/>the same lithe grace, but now his moves expressed a hidden power.<br/>Only on rare occasions was he subject the his earlier listlessness.<br/>His normal mood was now one of quiet confidence and lately it seemed,<br/>happiness, at least around her, which she didn't understand. Most<br/>prominent though was a constant, underlying, and unrelenting<br/>determination. One of the few features that remained of his earlier<br/>self was his trademark pigtail, still sticking over the collar of his<br/>own hospital scrubs.<p>He noticed Nabiki's observation and favored her with a smile. Even<br/>four years later, she still closely watched over him at every<br/>opportunity. Not that he minded. Especially when he could catch her<br/>in the act and make her blush like that. Nabiki had also changed over<br/>the intervening time, and much for the better in his opinion. She<br/>still had the the same highly attractive features as before,<br/>highlighted at the moment in a delicate pink. By now, several years<br/>of the intense training regime he had instigated at her request had<br/>refined her body into a sculpture of perfectly defined curves and<br/>angles in all the right places.<p>The pair made their way to the exit of the building, swinging their<br/>book-bags onto their backs and dropping off a few small items of<br/>trash. An alert observer would notice several signs of impending<br/>action. Glances were exchanged, position was subtly vied for, and an<br/>almost unnoticeable tension crept into their motions. Several of the<br/>other students had stopped just outside in anticipation while being<br/>careful not to block the door. Walking out the door, Nabiki posed<br/>today's stakes, "Loser makes dinner and does dishes tonight ?" The<br/>flush returns for a brief moment, and she continues with a surpressed<br/>smile, "and keep your hands in safe places this time, pervert."<p>"First one to drop something loses," he agrees, exactly side by side<br/>with her, not ceding any advantage of position, "and I ain't the<br/>pervert, here. I still say that you arranged that incident,<br/>'Biki-chan'."<p>"I can only credit the evidence I see, or feel in this case, " Nabiki<br/>smirked, "not your uninformed speculations. And don't call be<br/>'Biki-chan', 'Pervert'."<p>At some unseen signal, the two of them leaped into motion at exactly<br/>the same moment, encouraged by a vigorous cheer from the watching<br/>faculty and students. Nabiki sailed on a graceful parabola three<br/>meters high, the contents of her book-bag exploding from her rapidly<br/>flying hands in all directions, followed by the book-bag itself.<br/>Below her, Ranma bounced along an insane zig-zag course, somehow<br/>managing to meet and relaunch each flying pen or notebook before it<br/>reached the ground. He quickly added to the aerial carnage with the<br/>contents of his own book-bag as well as that of the pockets of his<br/>scrubs.<p>Nabiki was forced to provide her own impression of a demented<br/>grasshopper on crack as she met the falling items in turn.<br/>Additionally, she was soon forced to deal with several distraction<br/>attempts, dodging sweeps, throws and other techniques while<br/>relaunching the flying menagerie. The distractions she dealt back in<br/>turn whenever Ranma was reaching for a falling book or stethoscope.<br/>The cascade of flying objects marked their erratic course across the<br/>campus.<p>By now, the spectacle provided by the pair's antics had come to be the<br/>norm on the campus, and was generally treated with good cheer, not to<br/>mention a certain amount of wagering. Passing friends or colleagues<br/>cried out encouragement to whomever they favored, including members of<br/>the original Jusenko curse research group which had been their<br/>original excuse for being there. While the research group had made no<br/>progress on understanding the curse itself, they had gradually come to<br/>accept the enhanced prowess demonstrated by their favorite subject,<br/>especially as they were able to see the gradual improvement of Nabiki<br/>to near those same levels. They had managed to to come up with a few<br/>measures designed to help those subject to the curse, however, one of<br/>which was demonstrated when Ranma's course intercepted a sprinkler. A<br/>brief blurring of his form between smaller and larger was settled in<br/>favor of the larger as soon as his body cleared the cold water.<p>Finally, having covered the width of the campus, they neared their<br/>eventual goal of the hospital building itself. Ranma had just flipped<br/>feet toward the concrete wall of the small cryogenics tank enclosure<br/>in preparation for another bounce at the incoming stream of flying<br/>Demetrius, when the wall beneath him suddenly disintegrated into flying<br/>rubble. Deprived of his landing spot, Ranma shot through the new hole<br/>and landed on something inside with a yelp. The something responded<br/>with a curse of it's own as books, pencils, notebooks, book-bags,<br/>wallets, stethoscopes, and miscellaneous objects settled about him.<p>"Rraaannnmmaa !", growled the landed upon figure, "GET OFFA ME !"<p>"Ryoga ! " cried Ranma, happily, jumping up. "It's good to see you<br/>man ! It's been what, a year ? And you couldn't stick around last<br/>time. Hey, I got a sturdier replacement for that last anti-change box<br/>we tried for ya."<p>Nabiki poked her head inside the hole with a smirk. "Did the great<br/>Ranma Saotome get surprised ? Oh well, looks like you lose this time<br/>Ranma. Ryoga, however did you get in here ?"<p>"Ah man" whined Ranma, not too unhappily. "I haven't had to cook for<br/>a week. Now I gotta pay Keito off, too. Shoulda never bet a week's<br/>pay with her."<p>Ryoga looked confused, "How did I get in where Nabiki, and what are<br/>you doing in Okinawa ?"<p>"Ranma, you jerk, you bet _how_ much ? I think we'll have to talk<br/>about this. I know I'm not as good as you, but still you should be<br/>risking our finances. Even though we're being paid now, the Kuno<br/>trust is running out." Her reproach was unfortunately negated by her<br/>still excited and happy face.<p>Turning toward Ryoga she continued, "You're at our school again,<br/>Ryoga, although how you got in a walled enclosure with only one,<br/>locked, door is anyone's guess." Nabiki looked again at Ranma. "Three<br/>minutes left until you start your rounds," she said. "We better clean<br/>up. Fortunately, I think the Kuno trust still has some repair funds<br/>in it which should cover this damage. The hospital administrator is<br/>going to be pissed again, though." Ryoga cringed at hearing this<br/>last.<p>"Okay. Ryoga, we'll have to wait until tonight to fight. You can<br/>have supper with us, and call Akari from our place, right ?"<p>Again, Ranma and Nabiki sprung into a ballet of motion, with objects<br/>flying in a apparently chaotic disorder. Shortly, Ryoga found himself<br/>magically transported to the outside side of the wall, which had the<br/>rubble cleared away and it's hole covered in a sheet of plywood from<br/>somewhere unfathomable. Ranma and Nabiki, also apparently by magic,<br/>were again wearing full bags and had pockets filled with the<br/>appropriate contents, and sported matching happy smiles.<p>"Now wait right here until one of us comes for you, or I'll have to<br/>let slip who made this hole in the wall. Hmm, the research group<br/>might want to study your sense of direction too." Nabiki lectured<br/>briefly, with another smirk. The two then turned and made for<br/>different entrances of the hospital complex. Ryoga could see the<br/>happy expressions slowly fall from both of their faces, and noticed<br/>that they were much slower alone than they had been when together.<p>Cowed by Nabiki's threat, Ryoga sat down with his back to the damaged<br/>wall, and pondered the confusing changes in his erstwhile rival.<p>***<p>A cry of "Hey pervert ! Over here !" split the air of the campus,<br/>drawing the attention of the aforesaid young man. Ranma, not Ryoga,<br/>that is. Ryoga, waiting as promised with Ranma at the base of the<br/>wall he had broken earlier, turned at the sound. He was well placed<br/>to see both Ranma's and Nabiki's faces as they came in sight of each<br/>other. While Ranma had been courteous and friendly in their<br/>conversation (a change which still unsettled Ryoga), his expression<br/>immediately changed to a far happier, far less guarded one on catching<br/>sight of the young Tendo. Nabiki, too, underwent a similar<br/>transformation, although it was even more noticeable in her, as she<br/>lost the older, Furikan era ice queen facade, exchanging it for a<br/>happy and excited face of any young woman.<p>"Great news Ranma !" Nabiki rushed excitedly, as she impatiently<br/>flipped over the last obstacles between them, a small group of<br/>pedestrians. Ranma arrested her forward motion, catching Nabiki with<br/>a quick spin, and the two of them separated, without seeming to notice<br/>that Ranma had ended up holding Nabiki's hand. "I think I've managed<br/>a deal where you can do accelerated residencies and bypass the normal<br/>match process. They need nurses, too. Come on, I'll fill you in on<br/>the way home. Wanna race again ? Oh, I forgot we have company. Hi<br/>again Ryoga."<p>Ryoga blinked for a moment, startled at the prospect of Nabiki<br/>forgetting anything, then jerked into motion following the rapidly<br/>chattering pair in front of him. He caught up in time to hear Nabiki<br/>saying, "So they need another doctor for both Emergency Med and<br/>General Surgery, and they're willing to accept a resident since<br/>they've got enough senior staff, and they've heard of us. That<br/>matches both your specialties, and they want another nurse, too.<br/>We've got an interview in a week. It matches what we're doing now<br/>very well, too."<p>"Nabiki, where are you going, and what are you doing now ? " Ryoga<br/>finally manages to interject.<p>"It's a job with the International Committee of the Red Cross disaster<br/>relief team. They're creating a new 'first responder' medical<br/>assistance team. We'd get to go wherever there's a problem or<br/>disaster and help." Nabiki chirps happily. "As to what we've been<br/>doing the last couple of years, well, wait until we get to our place,<br/>and we'll show you." Nabiki pointed to the third floor balcony of the<br/>apartment building the were approaching.<p>At this, another remarkable sequence of events occurred. In a wholly<br/>unprompted sequence so sudden and smooth that it could only have<br/>normally achieved by a trained team with years of practice, Nabiki<br/>took a high step, stepping into the cradled hands of a suddenly turned<br/>Ranma, who had dropped to one knee. Ranma smoothly straightened and<br/>flung Nabiki into the air, assisting her simultaneous leap. Nabiki<br/>flipped once in the air and landed softly feet first on the balcony<br/>she just indicated, Ranma not more than a few seconds behind jumping<br/>up in stages via the balconies of the floors below.<p>Nabiki smirked and waved at a shocked Ryoga before entering the open<br/>balcony door, and Ranma called down before entering himself, "What are<br/>you waiting for ? Come on up."<p>Ryoga, quite suddenly alone, stood in shock. After opening and<br/>closing his mouth ineffectually a few times, he finally mutters,<br/>"Since when did they join the circus ?"<p>***<p>In Ranma and Nabiki's apartment Ryoga turns from examining the wall of<br/>the small living and dining area. Behind him, Nabiki kneels at a<br/>small table, rapidly working though a pile of paperwork or perhaps<br/>homework spread out before her. Paper flutter rapidly enough to sound<br/>like the shuffling of a deck of cards.<p>Ranma is cooking in the tiny kitchen lining the shorter of the<br/>interior walls, knives and implements flashing in the unnerving speed<br/>both have been displaying. Both have changed into casual, but loose<br/>clothing. Ranma no longer sports his Chinese style shirt, instead<br/>wearing a baggy sweatshirt with the arms torn off and a picture of a<br/>tall gray American cartoon rabbit. Nabiki sports a matching<br/>sweatshirt with the same character dressed in drag. Both shoot<br/>frequent short, glances at the other, as if to assure themselves of<br/>the other's continuing presence. The small room nearly seems to<br/>sparkle, overflowing with their energy.<p>Ryoga turns back to the wall. Nabiki had indicated it to him when he<br/>appeared over the balcony railing himself, shortly informing him that<br/>it would answer his other question. It is covered with newspaper<br/>clippings, letters, and pictures. The headlines all have a common<br/>theme: "Local medical students revive crash victim", "Local resident<br/>injured rescuing pedestrian from speeding bus", "Med school hero<br/>contains hazardous chemical spill, treats workers", "College students<br/>rescue hostages". It seems that Ranma and Nabiki have spent the last<br/>few years giving the local Fire and Rescue council some unasked for<br/>assistance.<p>Pride of place is given to a full front page of a newspaper. Fully<br/>half the page is a dramatic color shot of an obviously scorched Ranma<br/>sprinting away from a huge inferno consuming a high rise apartment<br/>building, carrying a child wrapped in blankets in his arms. One of<br/>the smaller pictures framing the text shows Ranma leaping between<br/>balconies, apparently just missing a piece of flaming debris. Another<br/>shows him giving the child to a woman, who the caption claims to be<br/>the mother. It is noticeably that even though Ranma appears in the<br/>photo to be having difficulty breathing, his clothes burned through in<br/>spots, and large and apparent burn blisters show on him, the child<br/>appears to be unharmed, even happy. A substance which looks<br/>suspiciously like frost flakes off the blanket.<p>Ranma is by now bringing a stack of plates and serving utensils and<br/>pots of food to the table, which is cleared for him in another display<br/>of perfect timing by Nabiki. Noticing Ryoga's focus of attention,<br/>Ranma comments. "We nearly ran short of time to get that kid out.<br/>She was the last one, fortunately. I'm still kinda pissed the paper<br/>didn't show any of the shots of Nabiki, though. We did a tag team on<br/>that one - I threw and she caught. It's our largest rescue to date."<p>Ryoga gapes a moment. What the hell have they been doing ?<br/>Strangely, as they sit to eat, he begins to see something familiar in<br/>Ranma, and, come to think of, in Nabiki too. It's almost feels like<br/>his old obsession to find and punish Ranma, back in high school. But<br/>that can't be right, can it ? He looks again, looking into their<br/>auras this time, and what he sees only seems to confirm his suspicion.<br/>That powerful and pure of a set of auras could only be generated by a<br/>strong purity of purpose. It was one of the reasons why he himself<br/>was able to learn the shi-shi-hokodan so quickly those years earlier,<br/>his hate and obsession with Ranma was so all consuming.<p>Watching their actions now seemed to make more sense, even sitting and<br/>eating, neither of them was idle or even doing just a single thing.<br/>Instead both keep occupied doing multiple tasks, completing<br/>correspondence, writing up notes on their patients, and holding a<br/>conversation about the new residency opportunity. They both finished<br/>the meal in Saotome time, and despite the earlier contest terms,<br/>cooperate in clearing the table and washing the dishes, excepting the<br/>heaped plate still only a third finished in front of Ryoga.<p>Despite the lingering mistrust and antagonism he still felt toward<br/>Ranma, Ryoga almost felt pity. He truly hoped that they were not as<br/>fanatically dedicated toward their path as they appeared. He now<br/>understood the futility and self destructive nature of such obsession.<br/>Just to confirm it, and to antagonize Ranma, of course, he pointed to<br/>a line of letters pinned up along the bottom of the display. All of<br/>them were from the local authorities, fire, police, or rescue,<br/>castigating the pair in some way for their risky behavior and telling<br/>them to leave the work to the duly appointed professionals. "Still a<br/>jerk and a trouble maker, aren't you Ranma ? You've been in trouble<br/>with the local authorities ever since I've known you. First at<br/>school, and now here. You also seem to have a knack for dragging a<br/>Tendo into trouble with you."<p>"Feh. When those losers have gotten through eight years combined of<br/>college degree and four year med school in half the time, and broken<br/>up half the crimes or saved half the people we have in the past four<br/>years, then they can say somethin' to me." Suddenly his gaze hardens,<br/>and his eyes flash brilliantly. "And leave Nabiki outta this. It's<br/>her choice, and you got no right to say anythin' 'bout her. This is<br/>in honor 'o Akane and a promise I made the Tendos, and not you or<br/>anybody else's gonna stop me, got it ?"<p>"Ranma, it's alright. Ryoga doesn't understand." Nabiki stops him,<br/>laying her hand on his arm. "Why don't you get that new model curse<br/>mitigation box, the copy of the one you wear now. You've been going<br/>to send it to Ryoga, anyway."<p>With a visible effort, Ranma regains control, and the fire in his<br/>brilliant eyes dampens. Turning, he vanishes for a moment,<br/>reappearing in front of Ryoga carrying a compact, flat box on a belt.<br/>"Here, ya wear this against your skin, and keep it filled with water<br/>and propane. When the belt starts to loose tension, the box squirts<br/>ya with hot water, it reverses the change before it can really take<br/>effect, so long as you're not totally immersed. It should hold up<br/>better than the one we shipped ya at the Unryu farm. I been wearing<br/>one like it for 6 months, and if that" Ranma waves his hand at the<br/>wall of newspaper clippings "ain't hurt it, nothin's gonna."<p>Ranma pauses a moment "Meanwhile, finish up and we'll go to the park &amp;<br/>spar. Ya can call Akari from here, and either stay overnight here or<br/>leave tonight after our fight. Either way we'll get 'ya to the train<br/>station."<p>Ryoga finally nods and digs into the rest of his food. Nabiki was<br/>wrong, though, he did understand. An obsession didn't have to make<br/>sense, it just was. And as honor driven as Ranma was, that only made<br/>it far worse. He finished his meal in silence, there was nothing more<br/>to be said.<p>***<p>Authors notes -<p>Despite working at a medical institution and school, I'm a programmer,<br/>not a doctor, and I'm certain I don't really understand what goes into<br/>making one. I got my information on medical school from the wonderful<br/>"How stuff works" website, .com.<p>I am also certain that a Japanese medical school differs in perhaps<br/>significant ways from an American one. Sorry 'bout that, but I can<br/>only write what I can find out.
