</div>Chapter 5 - A Meeting of Minds<p>The sun has just recently passed it's zenith, fading into a long<br/>summer's afternoon. The bright light illuminated a young man<br/>balancing a large pile of papers in a box on his head. The shade from<br/>the box, with the sun directly above, kept his head in shadow, but the<br/>end of a black pigtail could be seen sticking out from beneath it.<p>Perhaps unusually, Ranma isn't walking on the fence, even though the<br/>fence is his normal route to Furikan high school. It is even more<br/>unusual, however, that he should be following this route during what<br/>is, for other students, the month long summer break.<p>Nevertheless it is happening; Ranma is proceeding to Furikan, on summer<br/>break, and the papers on his head are a pile of completed schoolwork.<br/>Nabiki has been spending a lot of time with him recently, tutoring,<br/>and this schoolwork is the result. The school had agreed to accept<br/>Ranma's work in advance, in order that he could get his degree on an<br/>accelerated basis from work done at home. The stack currently on his<br/>head accounted for a good third of his senior class work. Ranma<br/>doesn't want to know how Nabiki had arranged this dispensation.<p>After a brief visit with everyone's favorite chibi-disciplinarian to<br/>drop off the aforesaid work, Ranma departs the school for home, much<br/>lighter than when he entered.<p>Down the street, in the shade provided at the intersection between two<br/>buildings, another young man waits leaning against the wall. A large<br/>traveling pack with a bamboo umbrella strapped to the top is on the<br/>figures back. As Ranma nears, the figure pushes itself off the wall<br/>with a low growl, and reaches for the umbrella atop his pack, his eyes<br/>begin glowing in an unholy reddish fury.<p>"Ranma, YOU WILL PAY !" With a howl of near inexpressible anger, the<br/>young man throws the umbrella like a spear, sending it whistling at<br/>incredible velocity toward Ranma's head.<p>Barely looking, Ranma gently sways aside from the unprovoked attack,<br/>and the umbrella buries itself to half it's length in the thick brick<br/>wall behind him. Ironically, it was the same wall recently repaired<br/>in the Martial Arts Bricklaying contest a few weeks earlier.<p>"Ryoga," Ranma says in acknowledgment, and turns a listlessly toward<br/>his opponent, just in time to gently sway aside from Ryoga's flying<br/>kick. Ryoga lands near his umbrella, and takes a moment to rip it<br/>from the wall.<p>"You, let, Akane, DIE !" howls Ryoga, as he attacks in near berserk<br/>fury. Ranma, however, barely appears to be fighting back. Each swing<br/>or jab of the umbrella, each punch or kick, is met with Ranma merely<br/>fading away or swaying aside from the technique.<p>The entire situation seems unreal or detached Ranma thinks, as he<br/>absently deflects a razor sharp spinning bandanna. Somehow, it's<br/>not like he's being attacked at all. Rather, it's as if he is just<br/>making his way calmly through some bizarre, deadly obstacle course<br/>while wrapped in cotton, occasionally having to dodge or deflect some<br/>deadly attack like the spinning back kick, back knuckle, overhead<br/>umbrella strike combination just now. He barely can seem to bring<br/>himself to care about avoiding the attacks, much less attack in<br/>return. The only goal currently in his mind is to bring this problem,<br/>as his others, to the person pledged to resolve them, Nabiki.<p>Ryoga, true to form, is growing more and more incensed as his opponent<br/>seems to glide like a whisper of a dream around each attack. Ryoga<br/>forebears to engage in further yells of threat or defiance,<br/>concentrating solely on avenging Akane on what, to him, is the cause<br/>of her death.<p>If Ryoga had been paying attention, he might have noticed that Ranma<br/>is not at all behaving normally. Not only is Ranma<br/>uncharacteristically silent, devoid of the enraging taunts which he<br/>normally employs, but his parries and dodges, while still graceful,<br/>lack the normal fire and spirit of Ranma's fighting style. An outside<br/>observer would see that Ranma isn't fighting back at all.<p>During the short course of the fight, an already deceptive distance<br/>had been covered. Despite the relative silence of this combat, the<br/>concussions of Ryoga's missed strikes serve to preannouce the presence<br/>of the moving battle. Pedestrians clear away from the combatants with<br/>the finely honed survival instinct necessary to live near the walking<br/>chaos known as Ranma's life, hurried along by the palpable aura of<br/>berserk rage emitting from Ryoga. Meanwhile, each wall leaped, each<br/>attack dodged, and each roof covered brings the battling pair closer<br/>to Ranma's eventual destination, the Dojo.<p>Unnoticed by the combatants, two of the pedestrians are an attractive<br/>auburn haired middle aged woman carrying a long bundle wrapped in<br/>silk, and a gi clad portly man wearing wire rim glasses and with a<br/>handkerchief covering a bald head. The couple exchange a worried<br/>glance and hurry down the street in pursuit of the battle. Both<br/>Nodaka and Genma easily see the change in Ranma's fighting style, and<br/>worry about it's import, and how it will reflect on the resolution of<br/>this fight.<p>The battling pair finally leap the wall of the Tendo compound, and are<br/>promptly met with a bucketful of cold water, flung by Nabiki. The<br/>Tendos had also heard the effects of the impending battle, and Soun<br/>and Kasumi were on the porch, curious to see why Nabiki had grabbed a<br/>fire bucket and rushed out when she heard the noise.<p>Quickly, Nabiki drops the bucket and snatches up Ryoga-P as he<br/>struggles out of his clothes. Slapping him smartly across the muzzle,<br/>she growls "I've been waiting for you to show up. You Will _STOP_ !".<p>Ryoga calms his piglet struggles, although his eyes remain an<br/>unhealthy shade of red, and turns his glare at the now female Ranma.<p>After making certain that Ryoga is stopping his attack, at least for<br/>the moment, Nabiki turns to the now female Ranma. "Ranma, I know you<br/>don't like this, but it's like we've talked about earlier. It's time<br/>to apologize to Ryoga."<p>Meanwhile, Genma and Nodaka have arrived on the porch behind Soun and<br/>Kasumi. Nodaka is struck by the seeming emptiness in her sometime<br/>son's and currently daughter's gray eyes, as well as the obvious<br/>reference of Ryoga to the pig held by Nabiki. Putting out her hand,<br/>she restrains Genma from advancing, cutting off his impending speech.<p>Ranma nods, reluctantly. "Ryoga, Nabiki's right, I don't like it, but<br/>I do owe ya an apology." Slowly, she kneels, bows formally, and<br/>gathers herself. Nabiki had worked on this speech with her for some<br/>while to get it right. Speaking formally, she begins, "I apologize<br/>for the lack of respect I have shown to you in the past. I apologize<br/>for the insults I have done to you, especially those belittling your<br/>Jusenko curse."<p>Ranma pauses for a moment to gather herself, and breaks from the<br/>formal speech. "And I apologize for not giving ya a fair chance with<br/>Akane." She takes a breath. "You're right, ya know, if you had<br/>gotten Akane, she'd maybe be alive now, and even though I'd hate it,<br/>it'd be better than ..." Finally, she breaks off, unable to continue,<br/>and turns her head away in shame and grief.<p>As Ryoga finally takes time to get a good look at Ranma, it finally<br/>filters in how much pain Ranma really is in. He should know, he's<br/>seen that same look often enough in a mirror. He also begins to take<br/>in the still only half repaired devastation in the yard around him,<br/>and realizes the strength of the depression Ki blast Ranma must have<br/>produced to cause it. Perhaps in truth, Ranma's depression might be<br/>far worse than his own.<p>Then, Ranma's apology registers, and his rage slowly drains away. He<br/>is still unhappy with Ranma, but despite his efforts, he seems unable<br/>to hold onto the hate he had nurtured.<p>Nabiki holds Ryoga to her face and hisses at him. "Now, damn your<br/>dishonorable cheating hide, you are going to accept Ranma's apology,<br/>and you are going to apologize for sleeping with Akane without her<br/>knowledge, using your pig form to come between them, and for carrying<br/>your gods damned useless fucking grudge. Akane's death is NOT RANMA's<br/>FAULT you damn pig. And I swear by all that is holy that if you don't,<br/>I will have you at the local pound and neutered within the hour. _Do_<br/>_you_ _understand_ ?"<p>Nodaka, who had been slowly growing more concerned over the situation,<br/>twitches upon hearing some of the things Nabiki said. Glancing over<br/>at Soun and her husband, she begins to see that the Ranma's situation<br/>may be far worse than she had been lead to believe.<p>Ryoga gives a little, reluctant piggy grunt in acknowledgment to<br/>Nabiki. On hearing this, she breaks eye contact and reaches for the<br/>kettle which Kasumi has produced, dumping the contents over Ryoga.<br/>Ryoga quickly scrambles for his clothes without making eye contact<br/>with anyone there.<p>"Well, we're waiting." This from an impatiently posturing Nabiki.<p>Ryoga hems and haws for bit, before finally not quite looking at<br/>Ranma. "All right, it's not like I forgive you, yet, but I'll stop<br/>the feud. It's not like killing a walking dead man would be any<br/>satisfaction."<p>"And ?" Nabiki prods.<p>"And I'm sorry for those things she said, okay ?" Ryoga throws her a<br/>frustrated glance.<p>Nabiki nods. It's about the best she expected from Ryoga. Ranma<br/>finally looks up, and meets Ryoga's gaze. Softly, she asks Ryoga "You<br/>need some help getting somewhere ? We could call a cab or something<br/>to Akari's place. And if you want, we can still fight whenever you<br/>show up."<p>Ryoga is surprised yet again. Ranma is being nice ? Perhaps he had<br/>misjudged him a little. Slowly he nods in acceptance of the offer.<br/>He'd still keep an eye on Ranma, in case he ruined any of the other<br/>Tendos, but for now he'd leave things be.<p>"If you'd please come with me, Hibiki-san, we can see about that cab"<br/>says Kasumi, as she steps off the porch to hand another kettle to<br/>Ranma. "Perhaps you'd like a snack while you wait ?" Shortly, she<br/>and Ryoga disappear into the house.<p>Genma, finally with a clear approach to the again male Ranma, begins<br/>to puff himself up. "Worthless boy ! Perhaps you should stay in that<br/>weak girl's body. It fits your actions today, backing down from a<br/>fight and apologizing to an enemy !"<p>On the other side of the porch, for the first time in days, Soun<br/>begins to show a bit of life. "Genma, my friend, wait. Perhaps the<br/>union between our families can be saved. It seems Nabiki and your son<br/>are perfectly matched, does it not ? The way she helped him resolve<br/>the other finances you arranged speaks for it."<p>"That is enough, Husband, Tendo-san" Nodaka's voice whipcracks across<br/>the yard. Both men cringe at her outburst.<p>"Ranma's actions today have been nothing but honorable and manly. Yet<br/>in response, you give him nothing but condemnation and pressure to<br/>marry immediately after loosing his finance. Your actions on the<br/>other hand ..."<p>"Tendo-san, did you truly allow that young man to sleep in Akane's<br/>bed in his pig form ? Have you no honor ? Genma did you truly<br/>arrange other finances for our son, knowing you had made a promise of<br/>honor for him to marry a Tendo ?"<p>"Um, well, you see, a martial artists road is hard, and any advantage<br/>must be seized. When the only way to feed us was to claim a dowry by<br/>promising my son in marriage, it must be done. Further, it was a<br/>burden to toughen the boy." Genma finally breaks off his<br/>justifications, seeing that he is only further enraging Nodaka.<p>"Auntie, there is something else you should perhaps know." Nabiki<br/>addresses herself to Nodaka. "When Ranma arrived here from China<br/>after my sister's death, he offered to suicide in atonement for not<br/>saving her."<p>This revelation brought the expected gasp from Nodaka. Still she<br/>straighted in pride that her son would consider his honor so<br/>strongly.<p>"I didn't think that it was an acceptable solution. So I suggested<br/>that Ranma pay his debt to us by becoming something which could have<br/>saved Akane, a doctor. Ranma accepted, and gave his word of honor to<br/>do so."<p>Nodaka looks thoughtfully at Nabiki, and perceives that there is more<br/>to the story than Nabiki is saying. "I see. But why your further<br/>involvement in my son's affairs, if that is all there is ? And why a<br/>doctor ? It is an honorable career, but not what I expected. Did you<br/>too feel you have some debt to pay here ?"<p>Nabiki flushes and looks down. "Yes, I too bear some of the blame for<br/>the failure of Ranma and little sister's relationship. Had I not<br/>acted as I did, they may easily have married and taken a different<br/>course of action, one that would not have led to my sister's passing.<br/>They certainly would have been much happier then they were."<p>She looks up and meets Nodaka's eyes again. "I won't let him die,<br/>Auntie. I owe Akane far too much for that. As to why a doctor, well<br/>... ", she glances at Ranma quickly, "you see him, he needs to do<br/>something positive, to know he _can_ save lives, through one means if<br/>not another."<p>Nodaka continues to regard Nabiki for a short while. Finally, she<br/>comes to an impulsive decision. She would do what she could to<br/>support this impressive young woman and her son. She turns to her son<br/>and slowly approaches the nervous young man. Stopping several paces<br/>away, she pauses a moment to free the Saotome blade from it's<br/>wrapping. Kneeling, she formally bows and addresses him.<p>"My son, this day you have made me proud. It is fitting that you<br/>should adopt a greater responsibility at this time. I ask that you<br/>accept this." Formally, she bows again and presents the Saotome honor<br/>blade to her son.<p>Nabiki quickly shuffles over and pokes a stunned Ranma, nodding<br/>rapidly at him. Shaking off his stupor, Ranma slowly kneels and<br/>accepts the blade. "I, um, thank you Mother. I will bring honor to<br/>our clan."<p>Nodaka meets his gaze and favors him with a brilliant, and totally out<br/>of place smile for such a ceremony. "I know you will clan-head. I'll<br/>have the paperwork processed in the morning." Getting up after Ranma,<br/>she continues, "Of course, this also means you have the responsibility<br/>to approve arrangements involving our clan."<p>Genma sputters, realizing that Nodaka in effect has just dissolved the<br/>Tendo/Saotome marriage pact.<p>Soun is devastated yet again, at least until Genma finally turns and<br/>whispers to him "Give it time. It's in his hands now, but the boy is<br/>already growing dependent on your daughter, we need only let nature<br/>take it's course."<p>Nabiki breathes a sigh of relief. This is the last of the<br/>entanglements she is worried about. Perhaps now she can get down to<br/>the business of giving Ranma something to live for.<p>***<p>Authors notes -<p>That's all the relationships and rivals, or at least all I'm going to<br/>bother to do. I also hope I've done a bit better job of explaining<br/>Nabiki's motivation in this chapter.<p>Also, it was mentioned in a review that I may have mischaracterized<br/>Ukyo in the last chapter, which is probably true. I can only plead a<br/>little wiggle room: since Ranma never said he doesn't love her in<br/>cannon, I choose to interpret Ukyo receiving such a statement as<br/>eliciting that reaction.
