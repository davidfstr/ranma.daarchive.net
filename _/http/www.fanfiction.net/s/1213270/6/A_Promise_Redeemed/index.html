</div>Chapter 6 - Rebuilding<p>Nabiki rubbed her eyes and yawned. It was early in the morning,<br/>during the quiet part of the night, but she was having problems<br/>sleeping again. Oh well, it always helped her to review her latest,<br/>most important project. She got out of bed, turned on her lamp,<br/>opened her Ranma notebook and considered her progress.<p>Overall, Ranma appeared to be doing somewhat better now, at least so<br/>long as she kept him busy. If given time to think, though, he tended<br/>to fall rapidly back into the uncaring lassitude he exhibited<br/>immediately after he returned. Nevertheless, he was slowing becoming<br/>reasonably responsive in more day to day situations. She could still<br/>see easily see the grief, though. For instance, Ranma frequently had<br/>nightmares, something he had done before only after cat-fist episodes.<br/>He had fallen asleep in her arms post nightmare several times more<br/>since the shi-shi-hokodan episode. She was almost becoming used to<br/>it. It was comforting, and not just to Ranma, although she'd never<br/>admit that.<p>There had been no more massive shi-shi-hokodan's, thank God. Even<br/>with the wide lassitude she had with the scholarship and expense<br/>account she wrangled from the Kunos, they couldn't afford many of<br/>those.<p>Cologne's instruction was turning out to be wonderful help with Ranma.<br/>The Martial Arts was still Ranma's first love, and he was most like<br/>his old self in the midst of trying to master a new technique. And<br/>between Ranma's and Cologne's instruction, she herself was progressing<br/>far more rapidly than she had ever believed possible. She could also<br/>see that several of the techniques Cologne was instructing Ranma in<br/>could prove to be invaluable in his new career, even though she was<br/>still far from being able to understand them herself. Still, it gave<br/>her something she could do with Ranma where he led her rather than the<br/>other way around. Further, teaching her was something that he was<br/>good at and enjoyed doing. That was important. He had to feel like<br/>he was in control of as much of his life as possible.<p>Shampoo and Mousse had both left, forcing Cologne to hire new help.<br/>Nabiki wasn't certain if that was a positive or negative. On the plus<br/>side, the more people Ranma had to talk with, the better he seemed.<br/>On the minus, she didn't want to risk Shampoo's or Mousse's obsessions<br/>upsetting Ranma's still delicate emotional balance.<p>Ukyo, that was rough. She still was not really comfortable around<br/>Ranma, and showed it despite her best efforts not to. Hurting his<br/>oldest friend took a definite toll on him. Nabiki made a notation to<br/>limit contact between the two until Ukyo was in a better condition,<br/>and another to talk again to Nodaka to brainstorm ideas to help Ukyo,<br/>both personally and to restore her honor.<p>School studies were proceeding more than satisfactorily. Given<br/>sufficient motivation, Ranma showed a surprising academic ability, and<br/>it also made a wonderful tool for Nabiki to occupy time Ranma would<br/>otherwise spend brooding. At the rate they were going, he would be<br/>ready to take the medical school admissions exam with a near certainty<br/>of passing in just another month or so. He had already done<br/>sufficient work to parlay into a high school degree for him.<br/>Surprisingly, Hiniko-sensei had been of great help with the school<br/>administration once she understood Nabiki's goals. She made a note to<br/>thank Hiniko-sensei, and to ask her to force principal Kuno to release<br/>the final paperwork and process Ranma's degree. She made another note<br/>to talk to Supinreru-sensei at the medical school during their next<br/>visit about arranging their entrance exams.<p>The medical school, that was a more than a bit of a sore point. Ranma<br/>viewed their visits their to have his curse studied as a minor visit<br/>to hell. Something just barely to be endured. What was worse, once<br/>the doctors and scientists there discovered his abilities as a martial<br/>artist, they had become almost equally interested in those as in his<br/>curse. People able to leap 30 feet into the air, shoot blasts of<br/>energy from their hands, be uninjured by blows which pulverized<br/>concrete, and summon whirlwinds from nothing did not fit into their<br/>world view. Nabiki suspected that if they took one more muscle biopsy<br/>he would scream. He did scream the time they took a bone sample. The<br/>last time they were there the doctors had so many wires and tubes on<br/>him he could barely move, it had taken over an hour to detach<br/>everything.<p>What was worse, even though the researchers didn't intend to, when<br/>they were distracted or concentrating on the latest experiment they<br/>tended to react to Ranma as if he were a freak of nature. Each time<br/>she and Ranma returned from a visit Ranma noticeably backslid into<br/>depression, sometimes dramatically. On one occasion on the evening of<br/>their return she had caught Ranma contemplating his tanto where it was<br/>displayed in the living room. She had quickly hustled Ranma into a<br/>training session on that occasion.<p>It may have been a mistake to parlay Ranma's curse into an admission<br/>into their medical program. Unfortunately, she have any other ideas<br/>compelling enough to get them into a school with Ranma's otherwise<br/>spotty record, his recent work notwithstanding. She still viewed the<br/>practice of medicine as the best route to rebuild Ranma emotionally.<br/>She had also hoped that the process of coming to understand his curse<br/>would help him come to terms with it. If they were very lucky, they<br/>might even come up with some way to mitigate it. He still hated being<br/>a girl though, and the way the examinations were going they might<br/>actually backfire and make him feel even worse about the curse than<br/>before.<p>Sighing, Nabiki put off the issue until later. She'd talk to Cologne<br/>and ask her advice, and perhaps if she talked to Supinreru-sensei they<br/>could at least slow the pace of experimentation. Especially once they<br/>started classes nd were within daily reach she would have to be very<br/>careful to make certain the researchers didn't overwhelm Ranma.<p>Also, they would have to start preparations for moving near the<br/>medical school. She intended to have them start a very heavy load of<br/>classes as soon as they passed their entrance exams. They would need<br/>to be close to the campus to do so, not several hours away by train,<br/>and that entailed apartment hunting. Not to mention scheduling visits<br/>back to Nermia, time with Cologne for further studies with her,<br/>finding a place where they could continue to practice martial arts in<br/>or near the college, and any number of other details, all of which<br/>would have to be in place quickly if they were to make the start of<br/>the semester. Nabiki reviewed her moving to do list, and added a few<br/>more items. She would schedule time for them to apartment hunt on<br/>their next visit.<p>Sighing, Nabiki put her notebook away, hoping she was now tired<br/>enough. Just one more check on Ranma, and she would try to go to<br/>sleep again. Hopefully she could sleep without nightmares herself<br/>tonight. She would hate to have to get sleeping pills for herself.<p>***<p>Nabiki paused to take another sip of her bottled tea, and glanced over<br/>to where Ranma was looking at apartment listings. A pile of half<br/>complete medical school paperwork and class registration information<br/>sat in front of her.<p>"How's the apartment hunt going Ranma ?" she inquired. "Anything<br/>promising yet ?"<p>"A few. There's not much in the budget range you gave me within easy<br/>walking distance of both the school and a park with a good spot to<br/>practice martial arts" he replied. "Here, have a look while I get<br/>myself another tea. You want something ?"<p>"Sure, another of these, please" said Nabiki, indicating her tea. She<br/>reached over and picked up the apartment listing Ranma had been<br/>perusing, and looked at the listings he had highlighted. She rapidly<br/>eliminated a couple of them, and double highlighted the ones she<br/>thought especially interesting.<p>"What's wrong with that one ? Ranma asked, looking over her shoulder<br/>as he placed her new bottle of tea in from of her, and then moved back<br/>to his chair and sat down. The two of them sat in a western style<br/>coffeehouse just across the road from the school campus. It was a<br/>place obviously frequented by the local students, and had several key<br/>resources they needed, like copies of the apartment listing Ranma was<br/>currently taking back from Nabiki.<p>Nabiki adjusted her new blouse to move a rough spot on the seam as she<br/>leaned over. One thing she rather liked about being out of high<br/>school was the freedom to wear what she liked. Or, at least, wear<br/>what she liked after she'd scheduled time to go shopping on the Kuno<br/>expense account. They couldn't afford anything extravagant, but it<br/>was still fun to do. Besides, she had thought Ranma would die in<br/>agony when she was dragging them between stores getting clothes for<br/>the two of them. It was the most fun she'd had since Ranma had come<br/>home after Akane. And despite his protests, she could see that Ranma<br/>was the better for it, too. It had certainly taken his mind off his<br/>other problems.<p>"Well, this one may be close for you, but I still don't leap tall<br/>buildings in a single bound. Even if you were to carry me, I wouldn't<br/>recommend drawing more attention to yourself here than you have too"<br/>she pointed out. "It wouldn't do us much good to have the researchers<br/>here withhold your name, as agreed, if we go and make it obvious to<br/>everyone what you can do."<p>"Alright, you have a point" Ranma acknowledged, his face darkening<br/>with the reminder of his "notoriety" with certain people on this same<br/>campus.<p>Nabiki internally winced at Ranma's reaction. Time to change topics<br/>again. "Now this other one," Nabiki paused, and smirked, "Well, I<br/>think Cologne would be awfully disappointed in you, especially after<br/>you just said you weren't going to marry anyone. Our parents would<br/>like it, though."<p>"Huh ? What'd'ya mean Nabiki ?" queried a puzzled Ranma.<p>"It's one bedroom, you pervert. Trying to get me alone already, eh ?"<br/>Nabiki couldn't help but giggle when Ranma's face turned red from<br/>embarrassment.<p>"Nabiki ! It ain't like that ! Come on, you know me better than<br/>that. It's not like I'd want to do anything, anyway."<p>"What, I'm not attractive enough ?" Nabiki arched her back and pointed<br/>her chest at Ranma, adopting an obviously campy pout as well.<p>"Ah man, that's not what I mean, either. I mean, you're pretty and<br/>all, but it's just, well, Akane ..." Ranma trailed off again, sadder<br/>this time.<p>'Kuso', she swore to herself. 'That's one topic I did not want to<br/>come back to.' "I know Ranma. I'm sorry" she said, softly.<br/>"Anyway," she continued after a short pause, "that still leaves a good<br/>half dozen apartments we can look at. We should be able to find<br/>something there that will work."<p>Ranma gave a weak smile, and nodded. Changing the topic himself, he<br/>asked, "What do our first semester class schedules look like so far ?<br/>I still can't believe that the dean decided to waive the entrance exam<br/>and just let us both in."<p>"Well, when you finishing your high school degree in that short a<br/>time, and brought up your grade point average that much, it was<br/>impressive. I imagine the letters of recommendation that<br/>Hiniko-sensei arranged for you helped quite a bit, too. As for me,<br/>well, since I tutored you, I obviously know the material just as well,<br/>and those same letters of recommendation all confirmed it. Since<br/>they've already agreed to let us in as special students, it wasn't<br/>that hard to convince him." Nabiki shrugged modestly. It really<br/>wasn't that hard. Much easier than some of the schemes she had pulled<br/>off back in Nermia.<p>"As far as our classes go, I've got us signed up for 24 credits each.<br/>This early in our program we can share them all too. In fact, we'll<br/>have share a good 60% of my class load. Unfortunately, you need more<br/>credits for your trauma medical program than I need for my nursing<br/>one, but I'll still be able to help you with your work so we can<br/>graduate and enter our residencies at the same time."<p>"24 credits, huh ? That sounds like it will actually be a break,<br/>considering what you had me do to get my high school degree."<p>"Yeah, well, we're just about out of time here. Help me finish up<br/>these forms quickly, and then we've got to see as many of these<br/>apartments as we can before we have to be in the labs again" requested<br/>Nabiki.<p>Ranma's face fell again, and Nabiki again cursed herself. Quietly,<br/>she passed over half the pile of forms, and pushed a pen into Ranma's<br/>unresponsive hand before turning back to her own pile.
