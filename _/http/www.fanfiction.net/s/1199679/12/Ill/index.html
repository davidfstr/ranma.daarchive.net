</div>Wowiez! 100 review anniversary! All is can say is thank you sooooo much for reading this. You guys are great!<p>Personal thanks:<p>Abc: Yes, yes. Poor Ryoga and Ukyo. Are you asking if Akane and Ranma will be together at the end, or Ryoga and Ukyo? Either way, I'm not giving out any secrets. I'll take cash though!<p>bittersweetKandy: Stalker-fiance. Hey, I like that. Ranma and Akane were meant for each other. It's a fact of life. I like romantic Ranma. And you never know what his fever is doing to him.<p>Sacchi: So sue me, I called you little one. Has anyone else ever noticed that one of the shirts Ranma wears to the beach says 'POINT' on it? I kinda feel like putting 'and laugh' underneath but I wouldn't destroy Takahashi's masterpiece.<p>Katsu-chan: Takahashi does enjoy love polygons in her stories. I recognize that song, it was one funny movie. Now, remember, neither of them actually said "I love you". Akane though Ranma meant it, but he blew her off. Oh, and you are cool too! Ja ne!<p>butterfly: I'm not sure if Ryoga and Ukyo will get together. A couple people are pressuring me to make it that way, but I may just stick to Ranma and Akane. I guess you don't have to have a disclaimer, I just like coming up with good ones. Sort of like how I go through all the books one by one and look for funny quotes, then type them out. Don't ask. I'm so obsessed.<p>Patirick: Have I gone that much out of character? How did I miss that? At least I'm still entertaining.<p>AnoNIME: They didn't kiss in front of them on purpose. It was an accident. Of course I appreciate your opinion and everyone else's. I wouldn't ask for reviews if I didn't.<p>Ranchan: Thankies. You know, you are even more insensitive then Ranma. I tell you I'm sick and you say "That's nice" or "Don't complain". We need to get in touch with our feelings here. Sarah and I will come up with a conspiratorial (trying to put in vocab word like Sach) plan and bring out your soft side. If you have one, that is.<p>Meeka-chan: Ranma and Genma probably never stayed in one place long enough for him to contract them. They were always moving around when and training when he was little. Plus, we never actually find out whether or not he has them in what Takahashi tells us, so I thought it would be a cool plot.<p>gorillazgal86: I love cliffhangers. That means that the reader will probably come back and read some more. I love knowing people are reading and liking my writing. Go . Now if only they could go a little faster..<p>Japanese Goth: They had to find out sometime. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Ryoga, and Ukyo is my second fave fiance after Akane. She is also the only other sane one. If you read some of my last A/N you will see that I'm not a huge Shampoo fan. More then one person agrees with me on that.<p>Delirium's Hostage: Thanks for entering the contest! I used yours! I hope my fic flows smoothly, I tried to do it best I could. You too are awesome!<p>From now on I might as well just fill up an entire chapter with review replies! On to the actual hard part in this so called 'fanfiction'.<p>Disclaimer: *is seen with a pencil sketching Ranma on a past Science test* WHAT? I DIDN'T DO IT!<p>Thanks to Delirium's Hostage.<p>Thoughts are in 'quotations'.<p>They broke apart when Akane heard Ukyo's gasp. "Oh, my, um, Ukyo, Ryoga.." She babbled. Ranma looked behind him and saw both his best friend and biggest rival stare at him in shock and hurt.<p>"Hey Ryoga, Ukyo. What brings you here? Heh heh." Ranma wondered how long he had to live. Surely Ukyo and Ryoga were going to kill him now. 'I leave all my personal possessions to Akane. I'm sorry I left you. Good-bye.'<p>"Ranchan, how could you? I'm your fiance! I'm the cute one!" Ukyo was shaking with rage and pain. She gripped the giant battle spatula in her hands so tightly that her knuckles were white. "Why did you do this to me? And with her of all people!"<p>"Hey, what is that supposed to mean?" Akane demanded angrily.<p>"I, I didn't do anything with that kawaikunee tomboy! You didn't see what you thought you saw!" He put up his hands in surrender, not wanting the brute of the battle spatula.<p>Akane's battle aura rose. "What?" She screamed at Ranma. "You pig! You are the most awful person I have ever met! That includes Saffron, Happosai, everyone!" She slapped him, going against her vow. He reeled back in shock, touching part of his face where her handprint was imbedded. "Ranma Saotome, I never want to see you again ever in my entire life! You disgust me!" She stormed out, knocking Ukyo down in the stomp to her bedroom.<p>"Oh, Ranchan, you really do love me!" Ukyo tried to throw herself at him but he blocked her.<p>"Go back to the restaurant, Ukyo. You go too, Ryoga." Ryoga hadn't moved an inch. When he heard Ranma talking to him, telling him to leave, he went downstairs in a stupor. Maybe when you lost the thing you cared about most in the world, a sense of direction kicks in and you don't go crazy with rage for once. For fifteen minutes at least. They heard a large boom outside and a vertical cylinder of ki head straight towards the sky in the most powerful shi shi hokodan ever felt by mankind.<p>Ukyo looked at him, his hard face masking all feelings. She didn't say anything, though she sniffled and was gone. 'How could I have done that to Akane?' Ranma asked himself. 'After what we shared. After what we told each other. I disgust myself.' He put his head in his hands.<p>A while later, he heard Akane's bedroom door open. He sat up in hope, thinking that maybe she had come to yell at him. Just seeing her would make him feel better, but he was too scared to go to her. She crushed his dreams when she walked past his door and down the stairs. He heard the front door slammed and cringed.<p>'Should I go after her?' He asked himself. 'When she comes back. Then I'll do it. Or maybe tomorrow. She should have calmed down by then.' He sealed the pact with himself and turned on the game system once again. 'I can't stop with this thing, I'm hooked! This one looks good. Hmm. Inu-Yasha. Let's try it!'<p>Kasumi brought up a tray of soup a few hours later. "Here is dinner, Ranma. I thought the soup would be nice seeing as its so cold out." Kasumi stared out the window with a worried look on her face. "I really should have made Akane take a sweater. It is so chilly, and she should have been back by now." Kasumi checked her watch once again, and was pained when she saw how late it was.<p>"What? Akane isn't back yet?" Ranma stopped mid slurp and gawked at Kasumi. "I have to go find her. What if she is hurt or she got kidnapped by some other prince!"<p>"Ranma, you are sick. You should stay in bed." It was a hollow answer, exactly the opposite of what she wanted to say, but her motherly duties called. He noticed that she didn't push him down as he got up and headed towards the door.<p>"I have to go find her. It's my job as her fiance." He whipped down the stairs leaving a smiling Kasumi.<p>"Akane! Akane, where are you?" Ranma was yelling down the streets of Nerima, frantic for his lost betrothed. He wrapped his arms tighter around himself as the wind picked up.<p>Up ahead he saw the park and thought that would be as good a place as any for Akane to go. He walked around the pond and saw no one. Every other person in Nerima knew it was too cold to be out. Ranma was sure even Ryoga had found some place to go. He was about to give up when he saw a huddled figure by a large group of trees. "Akane?" He called.<p>She looked up and he saw that she had been crying. He ran to her and threw his arms around her. She was frozen solid and he tried to warm her up as much as possible. "Akane, what are you doing out here? We were all worried sick! I thought something awful had happened to you. Don't you dare do that to me again, you hear!" He shook her by the shoulders lightly. She shivered.<p>"You're freezing. Here." He took off his sweater and slid her shaking form into it.<p>"Ranma, you are sick. You need it more then I do." She tried to remove it but he had her arms pinned to her sides.<p>"If you got frost bite or something because I kept the sweater when you have been cold for hours I would never forgive myself." He looked straight into her eyes. "Plus, I'm sure the fever is keeping me warm enough." That got a laugh from her.<p>"Please forgive me for what I said earlier. I wasn't thinking." He hugged her close.<p>"You never think, but this was different. You made it seem as if we hadn't gotten closer and it was still a competition between me and the rest of the fiancés. I thought you and I had gotten past that." Tears began to roll down her cheeks again, but he wiped them away with a gloved hand.<p>"It isn't a competition. You won a long time ago. I just kept forgetting to announce the winner because I was scared of what the losers would do. And I wasn't sure if the winner wanted to win." His blue eyes locked onto hers in a love-filled stare.<p>"Then I'm the official winner? And you will tell everyone else to back off?" She pleaded with him, hoping with all her heart that they felt the same way about this.<p>He bent her backwards for a kiss that warmed both participators through and through. "Not bad," Ranma smirked. "But I should probably see what everyone else has to offer before I settle on the first thing I see. Sort of like shopping for a car.<p>Akane scoffed and hit him lightly, knowing he was kidding. To answer his request she pulled him down for another kiss and he changed his mind.<p>A/N: Ranma messed it up and made it right again. They just keep going full circle. Maybe this time they made it right? *sighs* Praying might help. This still isn't over! Unless you wanna stop reading now, but I don't advise that. I have a plotting head, full of chapters just waiting to be written.<p>About the Inu-Yasha video game: We were talking about if I should specify it. My friend (whose nickname is Ranchan or Ranma, the one that I called Ranchan in my review replies) thought it would be funny if Ranma played a Ranma game. I said no, but did the next best thing. Inu-Yasha. It just so happens that a new Inu-Yasha game is coming out for ps1 anyway. I don't know if that is what Nabiki got Ranma, but he is playing it anyway!<p>Some of you have said that Ranma may be a little out of character. Remember, the guy is sick. That does strange things to people. It may be what is making him act a little unusual. Hey, maybe he'll like the new him and stick with it. He sure likes hanging with Akane. ;) Questions, comments, reactions, and reviews are greatly appreciated.
