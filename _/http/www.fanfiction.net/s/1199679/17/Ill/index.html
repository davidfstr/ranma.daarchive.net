</div>Personal thanks:<p>Katsu-chan: A judo chop with a fist? Hmm, interesting combination. Ranma does cry, in the last book of the manga, incase you haven't read it yet.<p>Sacchi: Yes, I finally get to correct your spelling! It is spelled Niagara! Muahahaha! I know we studied it in school, but where is the exosphere anyway?<p>Silver Angel: For me, this is not updating soon. Sorry it took so long. It says in my author notes what the reason is.<p>Harmony: Correction: You can not bring down a high fever with a cold bath. That would put you in shock. A warm bath is what is necessary. At least, that is what my doctor told me when I had pneumonia and I think I should listen to her.<p>Animalman: Thanks! It isn't nearly done, though I have given it several places that I could end it nicely. But I know exactly how I want it to go, so I'll let you know when it really is finished.<p>abc: Ranma never stops fighting. That shows more in the chapter.<p>Ranchan: I feel it is my duty to make sure that Kasumi does not say "oh, my." I am quite proud of myself for that.<p>Elisteran: I know that people can get more then one disease at a time. I had pneumonia and sol manila at the same time. Dr. Tofu is not a respiratory doctor. He resets joints and does acupuncture. I'm not an expert on that, but I don't think dying people are part of his everyday job and it could be hard for him, especially being a friend of the patient.<p>Legolas007: Nothing is hopeless! I wouldn't make it that sad. I think you will perk up a bit with this chapter.<p>Kura-kun: Oh my god, I so know how you feel! I started writing this and got a severe sore throat, pulled a muscle in my shoulder, and got an inflammation of my left knee, which means I have to take special medicine and walk around with a brace! Maybe this was the wrong title to choose..<p>Yuki: I'm glad you like it. I have been trying to balance out comedy and seriousness but it keeps coming more towards the later. I just wasn't meant to be a funny writer, I suppose, though I try to manage a bit of laughter here and there I hope.<p>butterfly: You are definitely welcome. Ranma has been sick for 16 chapters, but that only comes out to like 3 days or so. I don't even know now. That is kind of sad. I do hope you get a chance to work on your stories too.<p>Patirick: There is not always a cure. Think of some real diseases that people suffer from. Maybe there is some far off distant cure for Ranma that Akane should go off and find. Ain't gonna happen though. Not in my fanfic. Sorry if you were waiting for that kind of thing, but I decided to go in a different direction.<p>Lil Washu: I am trying to limit Kodachi's screen time as much as possible. One laugh and it will push them all off the edge, into the brink of insanity. She would definitely care about her "Ranma Darling" though.<p>Disclaimer: Insert a disclaimer here and pretend I wrote it.<p>Thoughts are in 'quotations'.<p>Dr. Tofu came back a few hours later, with everyone waiting eagerly for any good news that he might bring. "Unfortunately, anyone I know that might be able to help is at a conference in Okinawa. I'm sorry, but this is not my field of expertise."<p>"It isn't your fault. I'm sure everything will work out in the end," Akane said, sounding more positive then she felt.<p>"I'm not going to die," Ranma said stubbornly, crossing his arms firmly over his chest.<p>"That is the spirit, Ranma! Keep up that attitude." Dr. Tofu patted the boy on the shoulder. "I'm sure I can find something. I'm going to go to the University's Medical Library and read up all I can about this."<p>As the young doctor walked towards the door, it opened, revealing a lavender-haired woman. "Nihao, Dr. Tofu! Shampoo come bring help for Ranma! You bring good news?"<p>"Unfortunately not, Shampoo. I would love to stay and chat, but I have some research to do. It was nice seeing you again. Good day." He bowed his head at her, exiting through the door she had left open.<p>"My, my, what a polite man." A primordial woman, with hair longer then her body hopped into the room on a long gnarled cane, followed by a Chinese man with inch-thick glasses. "Hello, son-in-law. How are you doing?" "Why are you here, you old ghoul? Coming to make me marry Shampoo before I kick the bucket? I'm sure she has told you all about me. Well, it ain't gonna happen, so if that is why you are here you can just leave!" He was proud of himself for standing up to her.<p>"Quite the contrary, son-in-law. I came to help you feel better. Where are those herbs I asked you to bring, Mousse?" The martial artist who was so love struck with Shampoo produced several bottles and pouches from his robes, handing them all to Cologne. "Very good. Now this," She held up a sack, "This, I want you to go put in a nice warm bath. Not hot, but warm. Let it sit for ten minutes, then you relax in the bat for twenty-five afterwards. When that is finished, come back and see me."<p>"What is this stuff?" Ranma opened the pouch and stiffed at the contents. His nose wrinkled in disgust; it smelled of burnt coffee.<p>"It is an ancient Amazon herb, which has been in our history for 3000 years. Do not ask what it is. If I told you, I would have to kill you. Ironic isn't it? The thing that may save your life could also end it." She chuckled at the quirk of fate.<p>"Sure, ironic. Laugh it up, why don't you." Ranma shook his head in bewilderment. "The old bat has one sick sense of humor." He went to use the furo, adding the purse full of whatever the stuff was, and gently mixing it in with his arm. He then relaxed, letting it work its magic as the water floated over his body. 'This stuff smells horrible. I would be holding my breath if the old hag hadn't instructed me to breath it in deeply. "Part of the healing process" she says. She just wants to make me suffer.'<p>His eyes drooped in drowsiness, and he figured it had something to do with the herbs. He let himself drift off into a dreamless sleep, only to be awoken by Mousse. "What do you want?" he asked, still partially sleeping.<p>"The mummy told me to come in here and wake you. It is bad for you to be in the bath for longer then the allotted time." He handed Ranma a towel as he got out of the tub. "There are clothes lying over there for you to wear. Because of the medicine in the herbs, you should sleep as soon as possible after the baths. I'll wait outside, for I am to help you to your room."<p>Ranma was much to tired to argue, and did as he was told. He didn't even protest as Mousse and Akane steadied him in his climb to the second floor. He was sleeping before his body was even falling towards the futon. Akane covered him up with a blanket and headed downstairs to talk with everyone else.<p>"He is sleeping and quite soundly too. Are you sure this is going to work?" Akane asked.<p>"I never guaranteed that it would, and I am still not sure now. I worry about him. He has lost much of his aura, though he keeps fighting as if it were top notch, which could be draining it more. Not as if we could stop him or anything. The herbs in the bath will stop his body heat from rising any more then it already had, and hopefully may bring it down." She held out a small bottle and eyedropper to Kasumi. "When he awakens, would you please give him a glass of water with two drops of this in it?"<p>"Oh my, well of course. Let me put this is the kitchen."<p>"We should be going now. He most likely won't wake tonight, though it will be for a short amount of time if it does occur. We will return in the morning to see how he is." Cologne bounded near the door on her large walking stick. "Shampoo, Mousse, come."<p>"Cologne, I don't know how to thank you. This means so much." Akane gave to woman a look of lifelong gratitude.<p>"I am doing this because I respect son-in-law and would not want my granddaughter to be upset about the death of such a miraculous young life. We will return tomorrow." And so the three Amazons left to return to their restaurant.<p>Akane sighed with relief for two reasons. One, this might finally help Ranma, and two, they were gone. She wasn't sure why, but being around Cologne made her feel uneasy. Akane collapsed in a dining room chair, exhausted by how much went on in her days lately.<p>"Akane, are you alright?" Kasumi asked thoughtfully.<p>"I'm fine, just a bit tired. I'll make myself some tea, then maybe take a nap." She yawned soundly, stretching her arms high above her head.<p>"If you wait here, I would be perfectly happy to make it for you." Kasumi offered, scuttling into the kitchen, returning a few moments later with a steaming cup of tea. "Here you are, Akane. Have a nice rest." She kissed her sister on the cheek.<p>"Thank you, Kasumi. I'll try. Good night." She hurried upstairs, and went into Ranma's room, where he was still sleeping soundly. She smiled at his calm face, which was grinning lightly. "He looks so sweet." She yawned widely. "Maybe I'll just go lay on Mr. Saotome's futon for a while, then move to my own room. Yeah, that is what I'll do." She lay down on the mattress, putting her empty cup on the floor next to it. In moments she was dreaming blissful thoughts of a healthy Ranma.<p>They both awoke a few hours later, when it was nearing 1:00 in the morning. She rolled over on her cot, looking worried at his bright blue eyes. "How are you doing?"<p>"Much, much better. Is this for me?" He pointed to the thermos that contained the water and herbs Cologne had given them earlier. Kasumi had prepared it before time and placed it next to his bed so whenever he was in a conscious state again, he could have it right away.<p>"Yes it is. It is hot water and medicinal herbs. You certainly look better. You are no longer pallid, and your eyes seem to focus better." She reached over and positioned a hand on his forehead. Gasping, she exclaimed, "Ranma, I can't believe it! Your fever is broken! You are normal temperature again!" She glomped onto him fiercely, putting everything Shampoo ever did to shame.<p>"Are you serious?" He reached up and felt his own face. "Kamisama, you're right! Thank Kami for the old ghoul. At least she is good for something." He held her closely, squeezing her tight. "Oh, Akane, I was so worried that I would have to leave you. That scared me more than death."<p>She buried her face in his chest. "This was the most frightening thing I ever faced. If you ever scare me like that again, I'm going to kill you." He kissed her passionately, cutting off whatever else she might have wanted to add.<p>"I'll do my best." He told her, chuckling. "Now, go to sleep, it is really late." He didn't let go of her as they settled into comfortable positions, arms encircled around each others bodies. It was the most natural thing in the world.<p>A/N: Of course this is not the end! I just keep dragging you on, don't I? Well, I am terribly sorry about not getting this out last night. My internet went haywire, and I didn't have my laptop for half the day today, because I was having Front Page installed. I'll have a lot of time to work on it this weekend, when I take breaks from making a webpage for school. There should be several more chapters to this. I was also invited to the movies by one of my best friends right after school and we stayed out kind of late. But here it is, I hope you haven't been waiting to long.<p>A question that many people ask is "Who will Ryoga end up with?" Some people think it should be Ukyo, while others are rooting for Nabiki. I want to know what you think. Tell me in an email or review so I can know your opinions. It will also let me know whether you are reading this or not. I can be so sneaky at times.<p>Questions, comments, reactions or reviews are greatly appreciated. You can e-mail me at  or just push that little button in the bottom left hand corner of your screen.
