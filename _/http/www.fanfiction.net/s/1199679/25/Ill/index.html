</div>Personal thanks:<p>Kinai: Charlottes Web is a movie, I have had it since I was a little kid. I think I saw the fanfiction, but I haven't read it.<p>Solarfire2: So you are a big Ryoga/Ukyo fan? Hmmm. I used to be one, and I still love them, but I wonder why you think they should be together. What are your reasons?<p>Evil Dude: Nabiki was interested in Ryoga before she found out he was rich. She IS NOT HEARTLESS. SHE HAS FEELINGS. *Dripping with sarcasm* I'm so glad that you enjoy my writing so much that the fact that there were no reviews was your favorite part. Just knowing you want to get to my story so quickly makes me want to jump for joy. It is too bad that the entire Nabiki/Ryoga fiasco wasn't as interesting as the fact that there were no replies.<p>bittersweetKandy: I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you don't like the Nabiki/Ryoga pairing. Why do you like Ryoga/Ukyo, if you like it at all? Pairing up random characters is not a thing I like to do (probably because if some people I know read one of those they would kill me and I don't like them myself), and I try to give a good basis to the relationship.<p>Butterfly: Nabiki definitely deserves better then Kuno. She is way to smart for him. Why cant people realize that Takahashi set it up so that they hated each others guts? They have even admitted it several times, even though Viz thinks they make a good couple.<p>Lil washu: Glad you liked it.<p>Cluehunter Karou: Obsessions are ok. It doesn't matter to me if you are or not. I am not here to judge. Wow, you think I am evil as well? Lots of people do. Trust me. I too believe.<p>Sacchi: What the heck did you send him back for? I would have kept him! I want him! ;) Besides, my mom has always wanted a pig. Does she have to know he turns into a very hot guy?<p>Patirick: I thought the "Charlottes Web" was funny as well. Oh and I do not own "Charlottes Web" either. Man, I don't own anything. I was trying to remove some tension, I think it got a little too dramatic.<p>Ranma+Akane4Ever: WHY is Ukyo/Ryoga your second favorite couple? They never seem to care about each other at all in the series. Ryoga was just going to leave her to her kidnapper in the second movie. He only rescued her because she was going to take him to Akane. And the only times they pair up is to break Ranma and Akane up. Ever since I started writing this, I have seen so many holes in that relationship.<p>Ranchan: Tomorrow on the bus ride you are explaining to me why you think Ukyo and Ryoga should be together. I will not place Nabiki with Kuno. End of story.<p>Raye: The guts to do what? Kiss Ryoga or write a fic?<p>Stormeagle: Remind me never to introduce you to my friend Sol, the biggest Akane fan on planet Earth. I'm going to have to ask you why you hate them, and why you think that Ranma/Kasumi make a good couple. I know that Japanese is Shampoo's second language, but it is also Cologne and Mousse's second, and they speak it perfectly. If you are going to live in a country, you need to learn to speak the language. I am very diverse in the fanfics I read. In fact, my favorite fanfic is Ryoga/Ranma and Ranma/Akane in the same fic. It gets very confusing but is one of the best things ever written. I knew exactly how I wanted this to go before I started writing and I am a huge Ranma/Akane fan myself. Ranma/Kasumi doesn't feel right to me, because Kasumi doesn't like younger men. To each his own I suppose.<p>Maura: Well, Ranma still has Akane, Shampoo and Kodachi. I always wondered why Ryoga didn't have anyone. I would have scooped him up in a flash. I'm guessing your punishment is over. If that is so then I'm glad you're out.<p>Inuyasha: Would you shut up and make a good review? Why the heck would they sue me, for advertising? I never said I owned it, I just use it.<p>Vixen: Cologne may have not had a second pill and even if she did, it would make Akane too insensitive to heat. She could be developing boils on her skin from scalding water, and be none the wiser. That would be bad. I never noticed it before, but you are right. Shampoo and Kuno are a lot alike.<p>Briguy, The Writer: Don't ask me why, some strange personality quirk of mine, but I don't like girl Ranma. I love male Ranma, but not girl. Maybe it is because she is too overused or because many writers don't make her be Ranma, but she annoys me. Sort of like Akari, but I actually have reasons for her. Kuno and Nabiki is never really implied in the series, unless you count Viz taking liberties and making it seem as if they should be a couple. Takahashi meant to be business partners who despised each other. It shouldn't be something more unless (like with the fanfic Nabiki's Laws) there is a back story that makes them work.<p>Kishi: Nabiki has always been spontaneous, but never to the point of kissing anyone. But then again, there may not be anyone she wanted to kiss.<p>Lurkerchan: Yes, it is quite rare. I wonder why not many other people have thought of it, but have thought of say, Kasumi/Tsubasa and such. Those kinds freak me out.<p>Christie: Thank you, thank you. I would like to thank my mom for giving me the laptop, my school for making me have one, Sacchi for introducing me to Ranma, and all the people at the Perfect Edition message board who first let me know about . Other then that, I did all this myself! And also Mr. Jones and Mr. Aldridge who gave me time to work on this in their classes.<p>Chibi Inuyasha: It is more like the I'm-about-to-throw-up-green. Does that clarify?<p>Japanese Goth: Nabiki got MOUSSE? Now that is just taking way to much artistic liberties. *Shakes head* This is sad when the only fanfics people can write are the ones that pair random people. Everyone listen and listen good. If that is the only thing on your mind, do not write it! Or if you do, don't post it. Those things make me nauseous and I always wonder how bad your writers block has to be to make one of those.<p>The Cat Café is also referred to as the Nekohanten in some places.<p>Disclaimer: Insert a disclaimer here and pretend I wrote it.<p>Thoughts are in 'quotations'.<p>Akane raced into the hallway. "Cologne, get up here quick! Something is wrong with Ranma!"<p>A stampede came up the stairs, Shampoo in the lead. "What wrong with airen now?" She ask concernedly.<p>Akane tapped her foot impatiently. "I don't believe I called you Shampoo. You cant help, only your great-grandmother can."<p>Shampoo moved into a fighting stance. "Violent girl no can help airen. Shampoo do. You leave." She pulled out her bombori, aiming for Akane's skull.<p>"That will be quite enough Shampoo." The young girl stopped at the Amazon's commanding tone. "Go back downstairs and do your work. I can handle this."<p>Giving Akane a look that could kill, Shampoo threw her head back and marched down the stairs. Cologne sighed. "Honestly, I am going to need a steal staircase put in with all the running around her. What seems to be the trouble?"<p>The two walked back to where Ranma was clutching his stomach in agony. "I don't know. He just woke up and asked for you."<p>The old woman examined his face. It seemed to be breaking out, even worse then when he had the chicken pox. "It is an allergic reaction. This is not good, not good at all."<p>Akane turned white with the news. "Wh-what do you mean?"<p>The Amazon pulled her aside. "With his condition as bad as it is already, he is going to die. I can do nothing, because I don't have any idea what he was allergic to. Even if I did, if it was from the medicine there is no way to flush it out of his system. I am sorry."<p>Akane could no longer support herself, and sank to her knees. "Are you sure? There is nothing you can do at all?" Tears sat in her eyes, waiting to be unleashed.<p>"I'm afraid not. He doesn't have much time left. You should spend it with him and make sure he is comfortable." Cologne hobbled to the door on her staff, only pausing to look back and whisper, "Good-bye son in law."<p>Akane moved over to him, weak all throughout her body. 'He cant die! I need him! We were supposed to get married and spend our life together. I...I love him' She buried her head in his chest and sobbed.<p>"Akane, what is wrong?" Ranma asked, surprised at her sudden tears. He hated it when woman cried. 'Why... why do I feel so bad all of a sudden. It... it is getting hard to see.'<p>She looked into his eyes one last time before his vision was gone. She could tell that the pain was starting to fade as well. 'He is so young! How can he be going so fast. "Ranma? Can you hear me?"<p>"Akane am I dying? Tell me the truth. Is this it? Am I a lost cause?"<p>"NO! I won't let you. You can't. Ranma, I love you!" She held him tightly in her arms and he hugged her back with all the strength he had left.<p>"I don't want to leave you. I never meant to get sick. Please forgive me." He lay down on the bed and closed his eyes.<p>"Don't you dare go! I need you. We are supposed to get married and die together. If you die, I don't think I could go on. I love you to much." He tried to smooth her hair with his hand, but he hadn't the strength.<p>"Akane, don't talk like that. You can go on. You have to. I just wish that I could go on with you. I'm so sorry. And to think that all this started with chicken pox." His light chuckle turned into a heavy cough that racked his entire body.<p>"Don't try to talk too much, you don't have the strength. Why couldn't Cologne see if you were allergic to the medication before she gave it to you? Those idiot Amazons." Akane tucked the blankets around him tighter.<p>"Before I die, Akane, could I... kiss you? I don't want you to think I am a pervert or anything, that is why I asked first." He blushed.<p>"Oh, I don't think you are a pervert. I just said that to make you mad." She leaned over and pressed her lips to his. She smiled. "That was nice. We should have done it sooner."<p>"It was. Akane, you aren't uncute or a tomboy. Well, maybe you are a tomboy sometimes, but you can be feminine sometimes." He held her hand as she slipped hers into his.<p>"I'll never forget you, Ranma. I will miss you for the rest of my life. How could you die now?" Tears were flowing again, Ranma joining in as well.<p>"You're making me cry. This isn't manly. Tell my mom and dad I love them and let Kasumi and Nabiki know I have always thought of them as sisters. And I don't hate Ryoga. He is really my best friend. I just wish I had time to bring everything to a close before my life did."<p>"That was beautiful. I guess when nothing is left, you really get in touch with your soul. Ranma? Ranma? Speak to me! Are you ok?" She shook him lightly.<p>"Akane this is it. The end. I'm going. I just want you to know, before I died..." He broke off with a cough.<p>"Ranma, I love you. I can't believe you are going... without me." She squeezed his hand and brought it up to her face, giving his fingertips a kiss.<p>"I love you more then life itself. I always have and I will until the world is over." He then closed his eyes one last time.<p>Akane couldn't breathe. She just lay down next to him and cried, praying that this was all a joke and he wasn't really gone. But that prayer wasn't answered.<p>Downstairs, Cologne stood cackling in the kitchen. "I guess I shouldn't have added so much rat poison to that smoothie..."<p>A/N: First off, I'd like to thank Inuyasha and Posner for ideas. You guys rock! I wont be able to update until late tomorrow, because I will be in Cape Canaveral the whole day. Three hour ride there and back. Oh the joy. I hope this wasn't too out of character. I don't think it is, but you never know what the reader might think. Wish me luck, I find out if I make the softball team tonight. Questions, comments, reactions, and reviews are greatly appreciated, as are emails to .
