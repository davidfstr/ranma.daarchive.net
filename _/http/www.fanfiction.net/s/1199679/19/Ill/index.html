</div>Personal thanks:<p>abc: Thanks<p>Christie: Yes, Shampoo is not the sharpest knife in the drawer. On second thought, we should probably keep her away from knives.<p>Kura-kun: I'm impressive. Cool. The only people who call me that are my parents, but then they forget about me when my sister calls from college. Can you believe she is double majoring and gets straight A's and works almost full time? She also has had the same steady boyfriend for who know how long and is not even considering marriage until she gets her masters, which might not be for 10 years! She was also Vice President of her high school, valedictorian, captain of the cheerleading squad, captain of the volleyball team, pitcher of the softball team and she got a $10,000 scholarship! Oh my, was I ranting? Terribly, terribly sorry. Back to your review now. Evil plots are my forte, and I like them a lot.<p>butterfly: I'm still trying to configure how many times Mousse will mistake Akane for Shampoo. This is going to be fun. *Evil grin, followed by evil laughter and more evil smiles*<p>Kinai: I think she respects Ranma for his talent as a martial artist, but only cares for him because Shampoo loves him and wants him to be her son-in- law to fulfill the Amazon law. She doesn't exactly care about him because he is good at the art. Ryoga is good, and she certainly doesn't care for him, except maybe to teach him a move, so that he can be with Akane.<p>Katsu-chan: Are you getting the mangas by Viz or the original Japanese ones? Because if you are relying on Viz, you have quite a way to go before book 38 comes out. A friend of mine knows someone who works there, and they say that the rate it is coming out now, the entire series should be finished by 2008. Book 21 is coming out in March of this year, but my friend got it a few weeks ago. Don't ask how, I guess  is distributing them before hand. Watch out for mushrooms and fishing rods, that is all I have to say.<p>Patirick: I'm so glad that all of you think that Cologne is in character. I don't like the ghoul very much, though I highly respect her. I think that sentence was supposed to be "I wouldn't want to have to leave you." Hehe. Whoops.<p>Ranchan: I personally thought you could read, but you have proved me wrong. You know where I asked everyone who Ryoga should end up with in my author's notes? That is a poll. So you obviously don't get the concept or you having been reading the authors notes. Both ways, there is something wrong with you.<p>Sacchi: *would have fallen off the bed laughing if she hadn't already been on the floor* Just to see that reaction makes this all worth it. That was soooooooo funny. I read your review for ch. 17 then this one was right above it. Omg. Thank you for making me laugh SO hard. Hey, I thought you already knew I was evil.<p>AmberWings: I know how you feel. 'Wow this is a great story and I'm sure the author would appreciate a review. Oh well, I'm lazy I don't feel like it. Maybe later, if I'm bored.' That is how I am sometimes, don't worry, you aren't alone.<p>BlazeStryker: Hehe, couple of centuries, you're right about that. They respect each other a lot. I really don't think Genma is a very bad father. Sure he made a few mistakes, but he means well most of the time. He just doesn't know how to be a father. I'd still feel sorry to be anyone raised by him.<p>Legolas007: Cologne can actually see what is in front of her face, and doesn't ignore it like Shampoo. I was even surprised she said it though, and I wrote it!<p>Disclaimer: Insert a disclaimer here and pretend I wrote it.<p>Thoughts are in 'quotations'.<p>Mousse dropped Ranma on the futon Akane and Shampoo had lay out on the floor of the Nekohanten's extra room. "Ugh," Came Ranma's muffled voice through the mattress. "I'd rather die then have to be carried again. Wait, that isn't a good analogy, is it?"<p>"Not at the moment. Cologne is there anything I can do?" Akane asked as she fluffed a pillow for Ranma.<p>"Would you fill this large bowl with some cold water? You are the only one capable of doing that, besides me." She handed her a plastic bowl.<p>"Of course," She eyed Shampoo suspiciously as the violet-haired girl started tucking Ranma in very tightly with a blanket. "I'll be right back."<p>"Very good. Shampoo, you go get our extra washcloths."<p>"But Shampoo want stay with airen!" The girl hugged Ranma affectionately.<p>"Listen to your Elders. Now go get me those me those cloths." Shampoo pouted, but left the room anyway. She purposely bumped into Akane on her way out, making little splashes of water spray over the edges.<p>"Hey, watch where you are going!" Akane yelled at her retreating back.<p>"Shampoo not see violent girl. She not important, Shampoo ignore." She said with a smirk then sashayed down the hall.<p>Akane was almost growling with anger as she slammed the bowl on the floor near Ranma, causing more water to spill. "She makes me so mad!"<p>"Don't let my great-granddaughter get to you. She just does it because she is jealous and trying to get you mad. Like son-in-law here, she knows how to push your buttons. I am going downstairs to make some herbal tea that might help him. Wait here. I believe you know what the water and washcloths were for." She hopped into the cooking area of the restaurant.<p>"Well, Ranma Saotome, Akane Tendo, I have to do a few things for the Café. I shall see you later." He left the two alone, calling out, "My darling Shampoo, where are you?" Akane and Ranma winced as they heard several large crashes, the sound of breaking wood, bones, glass, and a loud "Ow."<p>"Poor Mousse. Shampoo doesn't deserve a nice guy like him. He treats her like a princess and should find someone who will treat him right." Akane put a washcloth in the bowl, then rang it out. "Lay down. I'll put this on your head." He obeyed, relieved at the coolness on his hot face.<p>"Thanks, Akane. I'm glad you're with me, even if we have to be here." He drifted off to sleep as Cologne returned.<p>"He must be exhausted. The diseases are destroying all his resolve. They are eating him alive. He does lasts a lot longer then most people would though. Wake him up. He needs to drink this." Akane saw a steaming mug in the old Amazon's hand and shrugged.<p>She gently shook Ranma's shoulder. "Hey, you need to wake up. I'm so sorry, but just drink this and you can go back to sleep." He glared at her, but quaffed down the substance anyway.<p>He made a face. "Disgusting. I'm going to bed now. If that is alright with you."<p>"Go to sleep before I put you into a forced coma." Akane joked lightly. She smiled as he settled back peacefully into the world of unconsciousness.<p>"Well, now, that should keep him out for a few hours. It may also stop the disease from spreading. Akane, for something I may try, I need you to go home and gather as many blankets as they can spare. If you can, ask a few of your friends as well. Thick blankets are best." Cologne glanced at the sleeping Ranma, as if contemplating her next move.<p>'Blankets? What does she need blankets for? She better not just be trying to get me out of the way.' Akane sighed. "Alright. I'll be back as soon as possible." She hesitated, then kissed Ranma's head lightly. "If he wakes up, tell him where I went." She bolted downstairs, wanting to finish this as soon as possible.<p>"Of course," Cologne whispered to nobody in particular. 'My granddaughter has lost. I will have to speak with some of the tribe leaders. I hope she will not be punished for something we could not help. I suppose we should have seen it coming from the beginning. I shouldn't have raised her hopes so high, or given her so many failed plans.' The Elder sighed. "Shampoo, please meet me in my bedroom. There is something we need to talk about."<p>Akane hurried down the street towards her home, accidentally bumping into a large form along the way. "Oh, I'm really sorry, I wasn't looking where I was.. Ryoga?" She shaded her eyes from the sun, grinning at the martial artist looming in front of her.<p>"Akane? What are you doing in Hiroshima?" Ryoga asked happily, tugging at his bandanna.<p>"This is Nerima silly. I was going home to get blankets for Ranma. We have to stay at the Cat Café until he gets better. Would you help me? Cologne said she need tons, and I don't think I can carry that many." Akane asked hopefully.<p>"Of course. Anything for you. Nabiki and Ukyo both said that they wanted to talk to me, but I'm sure it isn't so important that I can't stop and help you and Ranma. So, let's go to your house." He walked away, thrilled to do something for Akane, yet feeling sorry for keeping his friends waiting. Not seeing one of them kind of gave him an empty feeling, but he ignored it.<p>He felt her grab his arm. "The dojo is this way. Come on." He allowed her to drag him off.<p>Kasumi was more then happy to provide them with blankets. "This should be a good amount," She said, after handing Ryoga a fifth blanket. "I hope that helps."<p>"I'm sure it will, Kasumi. Thank you, I'll talk to you later." The sixteen- year-olds headed towards the door, when Nabiki walked in from the kitchen. She brightened up when she saw her little sister and guest.<p>"Ryoga, oh good, you're here. What I need to talk to you about is very important. What is all that?" She pointed to what he heap in his arms.<p>"I would love to stay and talk with you, Nabiki, but I need to help Akane collect blankets for Ranma. I could come back later. Is that ok with you?" He gave her a sheepish look.<p>The middle Tendo sister sighed. "I guess so, but are you sure you can even find your way back?"<p>"Don't worry; I'll bring him back when we are finished. I won't lose him, promise. Now, let's go, the sooner we leave, the sooner we get back. See you later, sis!" Akane and Ryoga left the dojo, leaving an extremely upset Nabiki behind. 'I wonder what's wrong with her.' Akane thought. 'I'll ask later, we usually tell each other everything.'<p>"Is there anywhere else you think we should go?" Ryoga asked his partner.<p>"Well, some of my girlfriends from school could help. Hiroshi and Daisuke are Ranma's buddies. Ukyo will definitely help. I think that should be enough. Then I'll take you back to Nabiki. Do you have any idea what she wants to talk to you about? She seemed really serious." Akane frowned thoughtfully.<p>"I have no idea. Hey, isn't that the Kuno guy up there?" Ryoga peered ahead, squinting against the sunlight.<p>"Yes and his twisted sister. Kodachi, the black rose." Akane groaned.<p>"That stupid gymnast." Ryoga shook his head in disgust.<p>"I never did thank you properly for helping us win that." Akane gave Ryoga a friendly peck on the cheek. Ryoga saw angels, but a form of a sad girl in the background, which made him think of how he felt for this girl.<p>"You fiend! What have you done to the goddess, Akane Tendo? Unhand her you mongrel!" Kuno held out his bokken.<p>"Who are you callin' a mongrel? And how can I hold her, I'm hanging on to all these blankets!" Ryoga yelled desperately, restraining himself from dropping the blankets to beat the boy up.<p>"You must be a conspirator with Saotome, holding the pig-tailed girl and Akane Tendo against there wills!" Kuno was enraged. 'How could anyone ever unite with that beast?'<p>Kodachi twirled her ribbon. "Where is my Ranma-sama?"<p>Ryoga looked back and forth between the two siblings. 'This could be a problem.'<p>A/N: More of the cast! Yay! And a cliffhanger. Dun dun dun. Ok, well I'm sorry for all that were upset by the fact that I made Ranma sick again. But it just means that there is more story left (as Katsu-chan pointed out). I'm sorry that this took so long, but my English hw totally freaked me out last night. It was frightening in the literal term! I expected to have nightmares. But I didn't. I'll try to get it out quicker. This would also be up sooner if  would let me post it! Oh, and thanks to Sacchi for reading this beforehand. Questions, comments, reactions, and reviews are greatly appreciated.
