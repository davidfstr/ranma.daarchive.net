</div>Personal thanks:<p>Maura: So I confused you? I do that often. Confuse people that is. You should definitely try to get out that one-shot out. I would love to read some of your work. Think about it.<p>Aqua Rosewater: NSS P-chan-Uc-chan. Hmmm, never heard of it. Cologne always seems to have answers doesn't she? I set it up to be either way, because I thought that both relationships could work. It is ok if you aren't sure, thanks for trying anyway.<p>BlazeStryker: I am glad to know that you think I am doing great. That is one vote for Nabiki. I am glad you added reasons as well, and that you don't just like her better. I appreciate it a lot, thank you. It will help make my decision easier.<p>Vixen: So she gave Akane the mallet? Go Kasumi. Is interesting good or bad? I mostly used Microsoft Word, some others I remembered from the books.<p>AkaneAlways: A vote for Ukyo. I thought the Monopoly thing was a good idea as well. Especially Ranma with the racecar. Glad to know you like Ill and I hope to update asap.<p>Katsu-chan: I'm sure you can get the last book in Japan. I had to get it of the internet because it hasn't come out here in the US. Viz is so slow. I can't tell you why he was crying, because that would give away a very important part of the story. Hope you had fun shopping. It is one of my favorite pastimes. LOL<p>abc: Hmmm, a Ryoga/Ukyo fan. I'll keep that in mind.<p>butterfly: Mercy. Yes that word. I seem to have forgotten that. Oh, well. I think Nabiki would be more considerate if they were a couple and she would do her best to keep him around as much as possible. She is a sensitive person on the inside.<p>Ranchan: Hey, I didn't do it like Sacchi, where she put like more then five vocab words in one paragraph. If you think you are bad when you are mad, you should see me really pissed. You have only got little spurts of my full anger. You know I am going to finish it, don't worry.<p>Kura-kun: Evil schemes? Me? Yes, that sounds about right. *evil laugh*<p>dennisud: The Nabiki/Ryoga project sounds like it would make a good fanfic on its own. Something to think about. I'd write it, unless you want to. I'm guessing by 'the two' you mean Ranma and Akane. In that case, thanks!<p>Legolas007: You're welcome. I love writing this, it is so much fun!<p>Silver Angel: I would be honored to be your beta reader for everything canon for whatever fanfiction you write. I'm so glad you love this.<p>Inuyasha: quote: Anyways i think it should be Ryoga. And.. I'm guessing that you are talking about Ukyo by the rest of your review. I have a bone to pick with you! You stole my review thing! "Questions, comments, reactions and reviews" is mine! My reading teacher used it last year and I took the liberty of using it to get readers to review. Don't use it again, even if you have altered it. If you do you will no longer have a frequent reader of your fanfic. Case closed.<p>Disclaimer: Insert a disclaimer here and pretend I wrote it.<p>Thoughts are in 'quotations'.<p>Akane was very warm when she woke up the next morning. At first she reasoned that she probably had too many blankets of her, but that was false as she could only push a sheet off her body. She snuggled next to Ranma, which only made her hotter. 'Body warmth. I should separate from him if I want to cool off. But, why so much body heat?' Her eyes snapped open. 'No, no, no, no, no, no!' She tentatively raised a hand and touched his forehead. "NO!" She pounded a fist into the ground in rage.<p>"Akane, what is wrong?" Kasumi asked as she hurried in.<p>Trembling, she pointed to Ranma. "His fever.."<p>"Oh, my dear little sister, I'm sure he will get better." She smoothed Akane's navy blue hair.<p>"Kasumi, that isn't it! His fever was broken last night. We both woke up around 1:00 and it was completely gone. But now it is back again. I can't believe it!" Tears started rolling down the younger girls' face.<p>"There, there, Akane, don't cry. Maybe when Elder Cologne comes she might have a few more ideas. Why don't you come downstairs and keep me company while I make breakfast? Let Ranma sleep, I'm sure he will appreciate that." She smiled at Akane, a 'Kasumi-knows-best' smile that Akane couldn't refuse.<p>"Alright, I'll sit with you. I'm not in the mood to cook though. I'll help with dinner." The two sisters went downstairs into the kitchen and Kasumi started the miso soup. Eventually, the rest of the household, save for Ranma, came down to eat.<p>"You mean, he was better last night, and now his fever is back? He never ceases to amaze me." Nabiki shook her head.<p>"Nihao, where airen?" Shampoo burst through the back door, with Cologne and a Mousse wearing glasses for once.<p>"Good morning. Would you all like some miso soup?" Kasumi offered, holding out a steaming bowl.<p>"Why thank you." Cologne said, accepting the breakfast. "I heard what you said about son-in-law."<p>"What does this mean?" Genma asked the aged woman.<p>"It means that he is worse off then I thought. I have a few ideas but he will have to be at the Cat Café so that I can go through with some of them and keep an eye on him." She surveyed the crowd's reactions.<p>"I think it is a good idea." Akane said, surprising everyone. They had expected her to be against it. "If being near the medicine will make him better then I am all for it. What did you have in mind?"<p>Cologne raised her eyebrows. "Well, he would stay in our extra room. I have several books and scrolls that could help with this sort of thing and I would be there if he suddenly got worse. Mousse, would you be able to carry him there?" The young man nodded. "Very good then. Akane, would you come with me so we can make sure he will have everything he needs."<p>The youngest Tendo nodded and followed the old woman up the stairs. Stopping before entering the sickroom, Akane remembered, "I promised I wouldn't leave him."<p>"I wanted to talk to you about that. The truth is, I know that you care for him and him for you. I am not in denial, as my great-granddaughter is. It might help his survival if you are there. You should pack some of your clothes as well."<p>Akane just stared, jaw hanging open. "I never thought you would say that."<p>"I honestly never thought I would say that either, and I'm still not sure if I have gone insane or not, but that is the reality of the situation. Now, go gather your things and I shall wake son-in-law." Akane hurried off and the Amazon leader hopped into the bedroom.<p>She lightly poked the sleeping man with her distorted staff. "Wake up. We are taking you to the restaurant."<p>At her commanding tone Ranma's eyes opened. "What are you talking about? Why do I feel so bad, I was alright last night?"<p>"Your fever has returned and you would do better at the café. Akane is getting her things and she will collect yours once she is done." Ranma struggled to sit up, supporting himself on his arms.<p>"Akane is coming too? How did she manage that? Shampoo will try and kill her in her sleep." He scratched his head.<p>"I offered for her to come. Shampoo does not know yet, and I don't intend to tell her until we are ready to leave. Get up and change your clothes." She stood there, looking at him.<p>"You could leave." He said pointedly.<p>She left. Ranma rubbed his head as he began changing. Akane peeked her head in as he pulled a shirt over his head. "How are you doing?"<p>"I've been better. I would be better if a truck ran over me." He flopped back down on the futon.<p>"I'm sorry; I really thought you were doing better last night. I was so excited when your fever broke." She sighed. "I'm sure that Cologne will find something that will make you better. It is nice of her to invite me too." She set a bag full of Ranma's clothes next to him.<p>"Thanks, Akane. I was really wishing that last night would have been the end of all of this, but I can't be that lucky, can I?" He pulled on his pigtail. "Now I have to stay with the ghoul and her clingy granddaughter."<p>She wrapped an arm around his waist. "Mousse isn't that bad when he isn't trying to kill you. I'll be there too."<p>"Thank Kami for that. I'd die just for being with them without you there. I guess I should thank the mummy for letting you come as well. I would want to have to leave you. I promised that I wouldn't."<p>"I know you wouldn't go if you didn't have to. We should probably go downstairs so I can tell my father I will be going. Wait here." She hurried down, taking two steps at a time. "Father, I am going to the Cat Café with Ranma."<p>"Who say violent girl come? Shampoo take care of airen by self." Shampoo crossed her arms.<p>Placing her hands on her hips, Akane retorted, "Your great-grandmother did." Shampoo fumed.<p>"That is right. I have invited her to help take care of the sick one," Cologne cackled.<p>"Oh, my baby is leaving home to take care of her fiance! This is a great day, Saotome!" Soun sobbed.<p>"That it is, Tendo. Take good care of him, Akane." Genma said.<p>"No way, Mousse!"<p>Everyone turned to the stairs, where Mousse was carrying Ranma down on his shoulder. "Stop fussing, Ranma Saotome. Akane Tendo, could you calm him down?"<p>"Ranma, behave!" Akane yelled at him.<p>"This is embarrassing! I am not a child, I can walk." He pounded on Mousse's back.<p>"Wow. You really are sick and weakened, Ranma Saotome." Mousse laughed, enraging the ill boy.<p>"Mousse no make fun of airen!"<p>"Saotome, really. You can barely walk downstairs; you think you can make it all the way to the restaurant?" Nabiki said pointedly.<p>"Boy, if you don't relax, I'll make sure that Akane makes your dinner tonight." Genma told his son.<p>"You really are trying to kill me, aren't you, Pop?"<p>"Ranma!" Akane screeched.<p>"We should go, before he gets himself into any more trouble. If anyone needs us, we will be at the Cat Café." The three Amazons, Akane, and a sick Ranma left, with Ranma protesting all the way.<p>A/N: Please don't kill me. I know I got your hopes up, then I crushed them. I hope you aren't too mad at me. Well, we will be seeing more Shampoo, Mousse and Cologne now. I hope I didn't make Cologne to ooc. I think all of the other characters will come back as well. Most of them will at least. Thanks for all of you who voted on the poll. It helped a lot, but I won't be giving out any answers in the fanfic just yet. Questions, comments, reactions, and reviews are greatly appreciated.
