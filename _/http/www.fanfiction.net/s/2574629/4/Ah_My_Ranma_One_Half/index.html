</div><p><b>Oh My Ranma ½!</b><br/><i>No Need for Goddesses!</i><br/>Started: 05Aug05<br/>By Ozzallos</p><p>Forward- <i>I highly recommend referencing the 'The Improbable Goddess'   series before tackling this one, as it might help you make sense of some   of the senseless events in this one ;) 'No Need for Goddesses' is basically   a direct continuation of that story, crossing over into the Tenchi universe.</i></p><p><i><hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><b> T</b>he determined girl focused   on the pile of chestnuts in front of her, brushing a strand of cobalt   blue hair from her face while her white karate gi shrugging with the action.   On the dojo mat across from her was a redheaded girl sporting a red silk   shirt, loose fitting black pants and a stopwatch, which she promptly reset.</p><p>"Again."</p><p>Akane Tendo took a deep breath thrust her hand into the pile,   quickly pulling as many of the nuts back as she could in the shortest   amount of time possible. While her hands weren't a blur, they were impossibly   fast by normally measure and the last chestnut disappeared into the new   pile beside the student. Sweat beaded once more from her forehead with   the exertion.</p><p>Ranma Saotome smiled, clicking the stopwatch. "One point   five seconds faster than last time. I think that's a personal best."   Akane blinked, and then beamed with pride, causing Ranma herself to remember   back to when she had first learned the technique she was now teaching.   If anything, the redhead was determined to be a better teacher than the   ones who had taught her. Ranma was finding that while teaching wasn't   easy, she had a natural flare for it and for the first time in her five   year stay at the Tendo Dojo, was loving every moment of it. Of course,   several key events had transpired to bring that side of Ranma to the surface.   First there was the minor issue of 'accidentally' being transformed into   the Norn Goddess of Luck. Needless to say, the implications that event   held were tremendous. It had locked her into the girls' body she now inhabited   and the engagement with Akane had ultimately collapsed under the strain.</p><p>So why was Ranma Saotome, Goddess of Luck First Class, Category   One Unlimited still living under the Tendo roof and teaching at the Tendo   Dojo? Simple. She was training the heiress, the first student the Dojo   had seen in generations. A few feet away sat the Tendo Dojo's second student,   Norn Goddess of the Future, Skuld.</p><p>"Go A-chan!" She cheered enthusiastically at the   victory. Skuld had started off simply wanting to improve her hammer technique   at Ranma's instruction, but somewhere along the way that line had blurred   and she had begun taking hand-to-hand instruction along with Akane as   well. The Hammer Twins, Ranma occasionally called them with no small amusement,   but they were starting to become good friends after an initially rocky   start.</p><p>"Very good. Both of you." Ranma stood up and smiled.   "That's it for today" Then with a twinkle in her eye, "But   now I have a surprise."</p><p>Both girls were on their feet instantly. A surprise? Sometimes   those words combined with the glitter in their sensei's eyes meant trouble,   but if practice was officially over, it was probably a good surprise.   Maybe. Skuld noted that Ranma could be devious like that when she was   in Sensei-mode.</p><p>Ranma nodded, "The Anything Goes School of Martial Arts   now has its third official student!"</p><p>Third? That was a surprise! Akane was almost visibly glowing   with pride now. Yes, she was still just a student, but she was also the   heiress and her dojo was growing!</p><p>Their Sensei turned to the door. "Come on in."</p><p>Even as the Third stepped though the doorway, Akane's pride   withered and died in shock. It was her, the hentai mercenary.<i> Her sister</i>,   of all people! It wasn't the mercenary part that bothered her so much,   Akane thought as Nabiki took her place beside Ranma. That was a given   and it had helped pay the bills. But the hentai part, on the other hand,   was a rather recent and disturbing development. The fact that She was   even going to make the pretense of learning martial arts was perhaps equally   disturbing, as her older sister had never <i>once</i> shown any interest   in the school or it's art.</p><p>Skuld on the other hand, could look at the girl with slightly   more objectivity. There was a good chance she could guess exactly why   the Nabiki had chosen to join the school. Not that she really cared. That   was between Ranma and Nabiki, but boy Urd would simply <i>eat </i>this   stuff up!</p><p>"This is probably one of the easiest introductions I'll   ever make," Ranma commented and Nabiki Tendo stepped forward. "So   why don't you tell us a bit about why you want to learn The Art instead."   Even as she made the request, Ranma cursed herself mentally. Now <i>that</i> had been a stupid idea.</p><p>Nabiki gave her a sharp look and an evil little smile, as   if she knew the landmine the redhead had just stepped on. "Well,   there are <i>several</i> reason why I'm here right now," She began,   enjoying the light shade of pink Ranma's face was turning, "but the   main reason I'm here is because my line of work involves <i>negotiations</i>.   If those negotiations should say, <i>break down</i>, I'd like something   to fall back on."</p><p>Even as her face heated up, Ranma admired the middle sister   in that regard. Though her answer was loaded with subtle and not so subtle   innuendos, the game she was playing with Shampoo was a dangerous one.   Two fiancées had dropped out of the running once it had become   clear that Ranma's girl-type was here to stay. That fact, however, did   little faze the Amazon, whose tribe thought nothing of the practice, especially   when the betrothed was a skilled warrior. The surprise had come to just   about everyone when Nabiki stepped up to take the Tendo's fallen fiancée   baton.</p><p>I should have seen it coming, Ranma thought silently to herself.   The transformation had opened up an added dimension to their relationship   as the two actually got to know one another for what really amounted to   the first time, spending evening after evening fine-tuning Ranma's new   power. But not all that time had been spent in practice, Ranma admitted   silently. They had talked. Laughed. Shared their problems. And somewhere   along the way, she had made an indelible impression on Nabiki Tendo without   even realizing it. Actually, she had been trying her hardest to ignore   the sister, truth be told. Even though her body was that of a girl, parts   of her mind still held the psyche of a guy, and that guy still noticed   girls. Ranma found it very disturbing and perverted when it came right   down to it, but only a fool wouldn't notice Nabiki, and Ranma had already   been warned of the severe danger she faced if she tried to suppress one   side of her nature in favor of the other. She had done it once before   and the results hadn't been… pleasant.</p><p>But that was done, and now Nabiki was playing for keeps.   It was evident that she knew blackmail and extortion would only hold off   her opponent for so long, and Ranma couldn't help but to applauded her   insight. Sure, they were formidable tools and in Nabiki's hands doubly   so, but she also recognized there might come a time when such tools would   no longer serve their purpose if the Amazon ceased to be intimidated by   them. Ranma could see the problem clearly if only because she had been   on the sharp, pointy end of Nabiki's tools for the better part of five   years.</p><p>Nabiki looked from face to face, reading her fellow students   eyes. Akane: Sibling rivalry, I'm a pervert. Great, she thought. Skuld:   Curiosity. A new friend to spar with. Shrug. Then back to Ranma: Embarrassment.   Respect? Admiration? <i>She knows every angle I'm playing here.</i> Nabiki   produced a warm smile that turned Ranma's face a deeper shade of pink.   That's part of the reason I like you anyway, Saotome, she thought, regardless   of your body. That mind of yours is every bit as sharp as mine, just focused   in an entirely different direction.</p><p>That smile faltered, however as an impish grin spread across   the redhead's face, embarrassment evaporating with it. There was something   else in her eyes now and that something had caused Akane and Skuld's faces   to become an unreadable mask. What was going on…?</p><p>"Martial arts can be another tool of negotiation,"   Ranma agreed, "but how hard are you willing to work to <i>sharpen</i> that tool? Take a good look at Akane and Skuld."</p><p>Nabiki did and the sweating girls had obviously been put   through their paces today. This was warning then, Nabiki thought. She's   not going to go easy on me just because. "I see."</p><p>"Good." The impish smile grew and the glittering   in her eyes intensified. "Because I'm going to train you twice as   hard." Nabiki blinked. Twice as hard? "That is if you're serious   about your… <i>negotiations.</i>"</p><p>Even through her shock she could see Ranma's underlying point   easily enough- Put up or shut up. It was also a side to Ranma she hadn't   seen before, but then if there was one person who realized the stakes   of the game she was playing, it was the redhead in front of her. Shampoo   was no pushover and the knife of blackmail could easily cut both ways.   When it failed her- and it would fail her eventually, Nabiki openly admitted   -She had better have a fallback plan. This was it, and Ranma obviously   wasn't going to take it lightly.</p><p>Nabiki Tendo produced a crisp nod. "I understand."</p><p>"Alright then," Ranma replied, her feral smile   softening only slightly. "Training begins at five a.m. tomorrow.   Don't be late. Class dismissed." And with that, her red pigtail whipped   around and she was gone from the dojo.</p><p>Akane and Skuld came down from high alert, staring at the   exit their sensei had just departed through. Akane spoke first, her low   voice totally devoid of the resentment she had felt earlier.</p><p>"Ooooh, you are <i>so</i> going to get it tomorrow, Nabs…"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Urd looked up from her magazine just in time to see her sister   clear the surface of the water fountain in front of her, heaven-side.   The redhead stepped from the fountain and onto the soft carpet of grass   that made up the park grounds where the bronze and white Goddess had been   waiting in. Urd rose from her bench with frown on her face. "Honestly,   Ran-chan. It's your first day Live. Couldn't you at least pretend to have   some fashion sense?<p>Ranma looked down at herself. Chinese shirt, black pants.   I'm failing to see the proble-Oh, she realized, suddenly. Good for sparring   and other mundane activities, but not exactly the attire a goddess in   her line of work should be wearing. With the slightest mental nudge, her   clothing evaporated in favor of an elegant tan and blue body wrap that   had all but the vaguest resemblance to a Chinese dress, bare in the shoulders   and back with matching arm wraps. She cocked her head in annoyance. Somehow   she still hadn't been able to get rid of that thigh-high slit up the side   of the wrap, which invariable produced a shapely leg everywhere she walked.</p><p>"Better?"</p><p>Urd grinned. "Much."</p><p>Even though she had bemoaned the circumstances her Goddess   transformation had originally produced, Ranma recognized there had been   a substantial silver lining to this particular cloud. The loss of her   male body had hit Ranma hard and she was still dealing with the fallout   that was producing, both mentally and physically, but it had produced   something of equal, if not greater in value- Friends, a commodity her   former life had in pitifully short supply. Ranma looked at the white haired   Goddess and smiled inwardly. That same loss had landed the Goddess trio   into her life; Urd, Belldandy and the dojo's second student, Skuld. All   three became fast friends as they helped Ranma cope, while Urd had become   one of her best; both bound to one another by their duel natures and the   chaos that plagued their everyday lives.</p><p>"After all," she continued with an amused tone,   "You can't exactly go around granting wishes looking like you just   stepped of the boat from China."</p><p>"Hmmf!" Ranma sniffed as the pair made their way   out and back into one of the many beautifully architectured suburbs of   heaven. "Says you."</p><p>"So, how'd it go?" Urd's grin turned into a conspiratorial   smile.</p><p>Ranma was about ready to protest, but didn't bother to waste   the energy. She had since come to realize that her best friend would wheedle   the information out of her somehow, even if it meant wearing her down   all day to get it. "She's serious." Ranma simply stated, as   if half not believing it herself.</p><p>Urd's smile turned into a look of smug satisfaction. "Told   you."</p><p>"But I ain't gonna go easy on her." The Goddess   of Luck stated firmly. Urd simply listened intently as Ranma continued.   "She's not even close to Akane's level, let alone Shampoo. It's thin   ice she's walking on. Blackmail won't keep somebody that determined away   forever."</p><p>Urd's neutral expression melted into a slight grin. "You   do like her." Ranma was about to protest once more, but instead produced   a single nod. The bronze goddess recognized the honor that single nod   bestowed upon her. Anybody else would have born the full brunt of Ranma's   denial, but she trusted Urd enough to know her darkest secrets. And for   Ranma, this <i>was</i> a dark secret. After the Yggradsil incident, she   truly became a guy trapped in a girl's body. Sure, that body was starting   to have influence on her, but you just don't shrug off seventeen years   as a guy. Urd knew from her experience as the self-proclaimed Goddess   of Love that the mental process itself carried just as much weight in   physical attraction as any hormone, and Ranma was being twisted into psychological   pretzel over that fact. Maybe if his upbringing hadn't been so strict,   this wouldn't be such a big deal, but between his mother and father's   rigid code of manliness, Ranma had been well on his way to become a man's   man. Well, except for the curse, Urd smiled inwardly. Having had to deal   with his girl-type for the better part of his life was probably the only   reason she hadn't cracked. She'd come close though. Very close.</p><p>"Maybe." She finally acquiesced, "But I still   ain't playing any favorites on this one. Heck, I'm still not even sure   what I think of her… She's being nice and all, but she also spent   the last three years blackmailing."</p><p>"You think she's hot." Urd stated smugly.</p><p>Ranma turned pink. "I never said anything about-"</p><p>"I'll bet you're just dying for another kiss!"   The Goddess of the Past was on a roll now.</p><p>"I didn't ask for that one!"</p><p>"And if you hooked up with Shampoo…!" Urd   added, clearly enjoying herself.</p><p>Ranma sighed, thanking God that the Goddess Relief Hotline   area franchise she had been assigned to was right around the corner.</p><p>It was a quick ride to the third floor and the open aired   office she had been designated for use. Urd had been tutoring her for   the past month on the do's and don'ts of granting wishes, as well as the   various procedures and mock telephone calls. One of the scenarios they   ran through had a guy that wanted to destroy the world, to Ranma's disbelief.   After trying to talk him out of it, he and a copy of the earth were shunted   into a special partition of the Yggradsil and summarily destroyed, according   to the wish report on file. Of course, Urd had to assure Ranma that any   calls about sexual relations with a Goddess would be handled by a different   office and now she was wondering exactly who this Peroth character was   that Urd mentioned in the same breath.</p><p>After a final little pep-talk, Urd stepped out, promising   to check on her in an hour or so. That left Ranma alone, staring at the   pearly white antique phone. This time it was actually connected and <i>Live</i>,   just waiting for somebody on the other end to summon her and make a wish.   Ranma's heart pounded and she stared at it for fifteen minutes before   finally realizing she could probably stare at it for another two hours   before it actually rang. Chiding herself mentally, Ranma walked over to   the bookshelf and pulled out the something she had been studying off and   on between Urd's lessons. Plopping down into the reclined floating chair,   she gave the telephone one last look before opening the bookmark to chapter   five of '<i>How to Win Friends and Influence Demons</i>'.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tenchi Masaki ran a hand through the short crop of hair on   his head, sighing as another couple found one another during their school   lunch break. He wasn't exactly bitter that he hadn't found that certain   somebody yet, he just hated being reminded of it every single day, he   mused as he broke off from the main body of student, finding a tree to   sit under on the school ground perimeter. This particular tree knew him   well, and while he wasn't anti-social by any means, it was just the place   to come to and forget about this particular problem. Or dwell on it without   interruption, one of the two. Tenchi plopped down into the grass and looked   up into the tree as leaves rustled in the wind. Sunlight spattered through   the branches and he took a deep breath. Well, at least he didn't have   to worry about the lover's quarrels and such. Of course with the right   girl… Bah!<p>He flipped out his cellphone, determined to take his mind   off the matters. I need a night out or something. Wonder if Kiro is doing   anything after school? Tenchi punched the number into the phone and sent,   waiting for the person on the other end to pick up.</p><p><i>Click!</i></p><p>"<i>Um, uh, this is the Goddess Relief Hotline! I'll   be right there to process your request!</i>"</p><p>Tenchi held the phone away from his ear, puzzled. Goddess   Relief what? He keyed the phone a few times, trying to pull up the number   he had dialed without success. Well, whatever. Obviously a wrong number.   His thumb hovered over Kiro's direct dial number when a shadow blocked   the sunlight. Tenchi twisted around to find the source-</p><p>"<i>Ahhack!</i>" He twitched reflexively, suddenly   realizing there was somebody now standing beside his tree, looking down   at him. Tenchi's heart pounded as he struggled to regain his wits. And   his breath. He hadn't even heard her approach! "Wu- wu- Where'd you   come from!"</p><p>"Oh, just thought I'd pop in and say 'Hi." She   shrugged and smiled mischievously. Having a chance to collect himself,   Tenchi studied his surprise visitor intently. The red hair and long ponytail   said it all. Definitely foreign, he decided, and the clothes… They   were exotic. No possible way she could be a student, he reasoned, looking   into her azure-blue eyes. She proffered a hand. "Tenchi Masaki, right?"</p><p>He nodded. Now this was just getting too weird. He took her   hand and she pulled him up easily. He now stood a full head higher than   the diminutive redhead, who seemed to be unperturbed by the fact as evidenced   by her continued mischievous smile. Too-too weird. "Um, who are you?"</p><p>The girl's smile brightened. "I'm Ranma, Goddess of   Luck first class, category one unlimited, and <i>you</i>," she paused   for dramatic effect, pointing at him, "have a wish to be granted."</p><p>Tenchi blinked. "Goddess?" Ranma nodded. "Of   Luck?" She nodded vigorously. "And I get a wish?"</p><p>"Yep," The perky redhead confirmed. "Anything   your heart desires." Then she waggled a finger at him in mock admonishment.   "Just let's try not to destroy the world and stuff. I'm still relatively   new at this."</p><p>Finally, some obscure connection clicked in Tenchi's brain.   "<i>OOOoooh,</i> I get it now!" The girl's smile faded into   curiosity. "The guys put you up to this!" Her face crinkled   with irritation as he continued, "Hahahah! When you see 'em next   time, tell them they really got me good!"</p><p>"Look, I wasn't sent by your friends," Ranma countered   irritably, "I'm a Goddess and you have a wish to make."</p><p>Tenchi continued to snicker. "And you just have to tell   me how you did that phone trick! That was genius!"</p><p>Ranma let out an exasperated sigh. "Just make your wish   already, kay?"</p><p>The student was just about to say something when the campus   bell chimed. "Aw, lunch is just about over. Gotta go. Nice meeting   you, <i>Goddess of Luck!</i>"</p><p>Ranma's hand dug into the tree with considerable force as   the boy trotted off across the grass and back toward the school building.   Little chunks of bark began peeling away. So he thinks I'm playing games,   does he? Ranma fumed. Fine. <i>We'll play games</i>.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Chapter 2</b><p><b>F</b>ifth period was just getting   under way and Tenchi was spreading out his homework on the desk in front   of him with minor annoyance. It was so much the math class he disliked,   but the teacher. The old man was the classic epitome of the boring old   teacher. Bald, thick glasses with a teaching style that was dry as the   Sahara winds. Even so, Tenchi was a diligent study and today would be-   The classroom door clicked open and the red head of a girl poked in, gathering   the attention of the class. Her blue eyes scanned the students quickly   until they locked onto Tenchi, producing a grin that looked all too familiar.   What in the world…?</p><p>"Ahem, excuse me Miss, is there something I can help   you with?" She had caught the attention of the teacher now, causing   her to step into the classroom. Tenchi immediately noticed the difference   in apparel, from the exotic robe she had worn to a silken red Chinese   top and black pants. The long ponytail was also missing in favor of a   shortened pigtail. None of it really did anything to hide her figure,   which was, admittedly excellent.</p><p>Her eyes widened and she smiled brightly, "Is this Algebra   203?" The math teacher nodded. "I'm a transfer student from   abroad and I was told this is my class."</p><p>The teacher sized up the new student with confusion. "I   wasn't told about any new students today…"</p><p>Ranma effected a dramatic sigh. "Oh, they must have   lost my paperwork again! Now I'll have to-"</p><p>"Now, now," He interrupted the obviously distressed   girl. "This kind of stuff happens all the time. Why don't you tell   us your name and a little about yourself so that the class can meet you."</p><p>Her smile returned instantly. "I'm Ranma Saotome."   She bowed formally to the rest of the class. "I've spent quite a   bit of time in China practicing martial arts and have just transferred   into the area recently."</p><p>Murmurs and speculation rippled through the class. China?   Martial arts? This little red headed girl? The teacher nodded thoughtfully.   "I'm sure you're paperwork will come through in time. Why don't you   have a seat so that we can get started?"</p><p>Ranma nodded and her eyes locked onto Tenchi Masaki once   more, that bright smile transforming into the impish one he had seen earlier.   He began to squirm as she made her way down his row and conveniently into   the open seat next to him. The teaching began in earnest and for the next   hour Tenchi found it impossible to concentrate. He looked over at her   for perhaps the tenth time since she sat down, only to find those blue   orbs and that smile looking right back at him. If this was a practical   joke, it's becoming downright unnerving, he thought, desperately trying   to focus his attention on the textbook in front of him.</p><p>Sixth period didn't go much better as the redhead had once   again found his history class, and with the same excuse, happily inserted   herself into a desk. The only saving grace this time was that the only   available seat was several rows behind him and to the right, but he could   still feel those eyes boring into the back of his head. Of course, turning   around to steal a glance only confirmed that suspicion. The bell didn't   ring a moment too soon and he bolted out of the classroom and into the   hall, hoping to lose her before his final class began. On his way, Tenchi   saw one of his friends and promptly cornered him as he was pulling books   out of his locker.</p><p>"Kuz, you're not trying to pull one over on me are you?"   Tenchi asked, a hint of desperation in his voice.</p><p>His friend looked at the normally levelheaded Tenchi and   shrugged. "No idea what your talking about T-kun. Why, problems?"</p><p>Tenchi sized his friend up and considered the answer. He   seems to be telling the truth. He might not know a thing about this girl.   "Yeah, there's this redhead from China stalking-" He managed   to cut himself off mid-sentence before terminally embarrassing himself.   Yeah, what am I going to say, Tenchi snorted mentally, that I'm being <i>stalked</i> by a redhead from china? Oh that's a good one. <i>She's   a goddess too, Kuz!</i></p><p>Kuzangi blinked. "Oh yeah! I heard about her! Rumors   going wild that she's a martial artist or something! I can't count the   number of guys already trying to work up the courage to ask her out!"</p><p>"She seems to be in every one of my classes so far."</p><p>"Whoa! Lucky dog!" His friend exclaimed. "If   she's in your next class, I want all the details, T!"</p><p>"Uh, right." Tenchi mumbled as his friend collected   a final book and shut the locker. "Right. All the details."   With that, he was gone, leaving the scruffy haired student to walk to   his next class. Maybe she wouldn't be there. Maybe she was just-</p><p>Tenchi stepped into the room and froze. It was her, surrounded   by a group of students who were happily making introductions and asking   questions. The eyes. That smile. He froze like a deer caught in the headlights   of a car.</p><p>"Yo Tenchi!" Her voice called out, waving him   down. His eyes widened in shock, totally unprepared to be addressed directly   by this redheaded psychotic stalker chick from China.</p><p>One of the girls around the redhead piped up. "You know   Tenchi?" There was no mistaking the subtle implication.</p><p>Ranma waved her off. "Oh yeah, he's <i>such</i> a nice   guy."</p><p>Tenchi twitched mentally once more. Somehow she had managed   to not only arrive before he did, but had found yet another seat right   next to his, even though she couldn't possible have known before hand!   As soon as his butt hit the seat itself, every guy in the classroom converged   on his desk. At least, every guy not trying to gain the attentions of   the pigtailed girl.</p><p>"You know her?" One student whispered in disbelief.</p><p>"Are you going steady?" asked another.</p><p>"Hey, introduce your friend to me!" Came yet another.</p><p>It continued like that until the school bell rang and class   started, dispersing both crowds to their seats. This time, the redhead   didn't need permission to join the class as she had already obtained it   before Tenchi even set foot in it. Probably used the exact same excuse,   he thought with no small amount of sarcasm. She made the standard introduction   when called upon and class began once more in earnest.</p><p>Concentrating, of course, was a lost cause.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Once again, he managed to duck out of class faster than his   redheaded stalker and breathed a sigh of relief as he stepped into the   open air. The day was done and she couldn't possibly follow him-<p>"Yo."</p><p>-Home? Tenchi twisted around slowly to find those blue eyes,   staring at him, leaning lazily on the wall of the main entrance he had   just departed. She pushed off easily and walked over to him. He took a   step back but it was too late- The redhead had snaked her arm around his   and locked it in place with a smile.</p><p>It wasn't quite a Shampoo-style glomp, Ranma noted as an   afterthought, but it was close. Just enough to make him feel extremely   uncomfortable. What could she say, having learned from the best and all.   The attention they were now gathering was just an added bonus. "Hmmf.   Now you can't get away."</p><p>"What do you want from me!" Tenchi hissed desperately,   trying to wriggle his arm out of her grasp. Unfortunately, he already   had two strikes against him with Ranma being a world class martial artist   and a goddess, so the arm stayed firmly in place.</p><p>"Your wish so we can both go home." Ranma said   with an indifferent shrug.</p><p>"I <i>wish </i>you would let me go!" Tenchi had   ceased his struggles, settling for glaring at the girl attached to his   arm.</p><p>She sighed. "Sorry, bro, but it's gotta come from the   heart, or something like that." Then she winked, shattering his glare.   "By the time this is all said an done, that my very well be your   hearts desire anyway."</p><p>Now it was Tenchi's turn to sigh. "Ok, whatever. You're   the Martial Arts Goddess of Luck from China." His mind began turning   over all the options to somehow detach this girl from his arm. Not that   she wasn't cute or anything, just clearly insane.</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "Flattery will get you nowhere. Now   make your wish."</p><p>Then it came to Tenchi. It was so simple it was genius. "Well,   Miss China, I'm going home. See you around." <i>God, I hope not,</i> he silently amended and began to walk down the sidewalk. The plan had   been brilliant. She would never actually follow him home, but there was   a problem. She was still attached to his arm. "I'm going to the bus   now." Ranma simply nodded with a smile and they walked. Together.   Off the school property and to the nearest bus stop. She's determined,   I'll give her that, Tenchi admitted, but this is where the rubber meets   the road. "Ok, I'm going get on the bus and going home." She   nodded again. Damn that smile was getting irritating… Which happened   to be exactly what Akane and Skuld thought whenever Ranma was busy mopping   the dojo floors with them during practice, ironically enough. He endured   the twiddling of a group of girls that couldn't help but to steal glances   at them. Occasionally the words 'cute couple' and 'so romantic' would   filter over to them until the bus finally arrived. Tenchi looked down   at his new accessory and drew a breath.</p><p>"Yes, yes. We're getting on the bus." Ranma anticipated.   "So lets go already."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was ten minutes into the bus ride home and Tenchi was   realizing that his brilliant plan had gone horribly wrong. He didn't know   how and he didn't know why, but the redheaded psychotic stalker was still   attached to his arm. Ranma, on the other hand, was actually having fun,   finally being on the giving end of a glomp instead of the receiving end.   It was payback for all the trouble this one was making her go through,   she mused as he squirmed uncomfortably in the seat next to her. That,   and it felt… Nice. Dang, now why did I have to go and feel that,   she thought sourly. Wonder if that's the way Shampoo feels whenever she   attaches herself to me…? Nice…?<p>Tenchi looked down at the fixture on her arm, noticing that   her smile had drifted away into a mask of deep thought. What was up with   this girl? Ok, you can't possibly be a Goddess. That was probably just   ego talking. Figurative speech. <i>Maybe</i> you're a martial artist.   As foreign as you look, I guess China isn't totally out of the realm of   possibility either. Does she just like me <i>that</i> much? No, any girl   this forward would probably just come right and say it. She blinked, finally   noticing the attention she was receiving and the smile fell back into   place.</p><p>"Make your wish yet?"</p><p>He shook his head. "You're serious about this aren't   you?"</p><p>"Jeez, one stop from your house and you're just now   realizing that?" Ranma rolled her eyes. "Could have saved us   both a lot of time if you had back at the school."</p><p>The student's mouth fell open. "Just how do you know   where I live?"</p><p>She sighed, finally uncoiling her arm from his. "Bus   stop is coming up."</p><p>The bus rolled to a halt and Ranma got up, walking down the   aisle and out the door, Tenchi following behind her. Not that it mattered   anymore whether she had her arm around his or not. She apparently knew   exactly where he lived and was obviously bound and determined to get this   wish thing out of him if it was the last thing she did. Finally the bus   rumbled off, leaving the two alone on the hillside road overlooking the   Masaki property.</p><p>"Nice place you got down there," She noted with   approval. "Looks better from this angle." She found the concrete   stairway that led down to the house easily enough and began walking.</p><p>He hurried after her as she began her decent. "This   angle? You mean you've <i>seen </i>it before?" What the heck was   going on here?</p><p>"Yep, but only from the air." She smiled back at   him. "Shrine is off to the right?"</p><p>Tenchi nodded dumbly and she took the fork right. "Where   are you going?"</p><p>"To see the shrine, duh." Ranma heckled and kept   walking.</p><p>"But why?"</p><p>"Because I'm nosey like that and you won't make your   damn wish." She shrugged. "I'll just have to occupy myself until   you do."</p><p>Ranma approached a set of misshapen stone markers, indicating   the boundaries of the shrine just beyond, and she stepped across them.   As soon as her foot touched the ground, her breath was immediately sucked   away and she stiffened. Power came to bear and coursed through the redhead   as if she had just completed some mystical circuit. Tenchi jumped back   and the air howled around him as the girl burst into a bright golden aura.   She flinched once more and luminescent wings sprouted from her shoulders,   stretching to their full extension before relaxing into a semi folded   state on her back. With the wings came the dress and ponytail she had   worn earlier when they first met, as did the marks around her eyes and   forehead. Finally, her body relaxed and Ranma found that she could inhale   once more. Well that was… Unexpected, she thought, feeling the change.   The shrine was alive around her and she could feel it too, like it was   happy that she had arrived. Power continued to swirl through her as it   welcomed her home. Or at least home away from home.</p><p>Ranma turned to find Tenchi on the ground with an absolute   look of incredulity on his face. She proffered her hand to him for the   second time that day from much the same position as the first. The impish   smile had returned with a vengeance, Her wings shifting slightly.</p><p>"Maybe I should reintroduce myself. I'm Ranma Saotome,   Goddess of Luck First Class, Category One, Unlimited."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Now they walked down the path to the house, Ranma no longer   even bothering to conceal her wings or wardrobe. If full goddess was what   it took to get a wish out of this joker, then full goddess it is. Heck,   she'd bring Feather Light out if it would speed up the process at this   point. She glanced at the student who was still staring at her.<p>"Ah, Um…" Tenchi stammered, "I'm very   sorry about…"</p><p>"Aw, don't worry about it." Ranma waved the apology aside.   "It's my first time too."</p><p>"You're first…?"</p><p>"Granting a wish." She clarified. Ranma really   couldn't get mad at the guy since he was so far out of his depth it wasn't   even funny. Kinda like me a few months back, she thought with irony. "Maybe   I should have popped the wings sooner…" She mused.</p><p>"Ha! Are you kidding!" Tenchi snapped out of his   trance of astonishment. "If you would have done that anywhere near   a public place, you'd have people gawking for miles."</p><p>Ranma winced. "Good point."</p><p>"I'm sorry I still don't have a wish for you yet."   Tenchi apologized as they crossed the lawn to his residence. "I mean,   I can get you something to eat while you wait though."</p><p>She smiled. At least he was sincere enough. And food was   always a good thing. It was less than ten minutes later that Tenchi produced   a nice hot bowl or raman with all the fixings and Ranma dug into it with   gusto. Tenchi was chuckling at her appetite just as the kitchen door clicked   open, admitting a kindly old man with mustache and a well kept gray mane.   Regardless of appearances, he radiated power.</p><p>"Ah, so this is the one that paid a visit to the temple!"   He noted and smiling, neither taken back by her wings or the fact that   she was in their kitchen with Tenchi.</p><p>Ranma, with noodles hanging out of her mouth and chopsticks   in one hand couldn't do much more than look up at him and wave with her   free one nonchalantly. He seemed remarkably calm about it, she noted.   If he was good with having a Goddess in the kitchen, she wasn't going   to worry too much about it either.</p><p>"Ah, Grandfather! I can explain!" Tenchi exclaimed   at the elder's sudden appearance. He looked at Ranma, sucking up noodles   from the bowl at their table. "Um, ah… Well, actually, no I   can't."</p><p>. Ranma finished her helping and offered the most suitable   explanation. "Your grandson dialed the Goddess Relief Hotline and   has qualified to make a wish."</p><p>"A wish, you say?"</p><p>She nodded. "Yep. Anything his heart desires."   Then she added with a sidelong glance over to Tenchi. "Sometime before   tomorrow, preferably. I've got students to teach and a dojo to run."</p><p>"You weren't kidding about that martial arts thing either,   were you?" Tenchi asked, clearly impressed.</p><p>"Goddesses can't lie." She shrugged.</p><p>"What about all that stuff about being transferred from   China!" he exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "Sure I was a transfer student. Transferred   into your class on my own authority. And I did train in China for quite   a long time before coming back to Japan. As for martial arts, I'm probably   one of the best you'll ever meet."</p><p>"How about the paperwork?"</p><p>"I made up my own paperwork." She now had a playful   look on her face. "...and gave it to a friend to be lost."</p><p>At first Tenchi thought that it was all bravado and ego talking   until he realized that her voice held absolutely none of those elements.   Just as she knew she was a Goddess, she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt   she was one of the best martial artists alive.</p><p>Tenchi's grandfather interrupted his thoughts. "And   you<i> still</i> haven't made your wish?"</p><p>The grandson looked down at the table and shuffled his feet.   "Ah, no."</p><p>"I don't think you realize the depth of honor bestowed   upon you, Tenchi." The wisened old man admonished.</p><p>"Yeah, it took me half the day just to convince him   I was a Goddess." Ranma chimed in for fun.</p><p>"Well who would have believed you were a goddess!"   the young man bristled.</p><p>Ranma's gaze narrowed on Tenchi. "Are you saying I don't   make a<i> good</i> goddess?"</p><p>"I didn't mean it like that!"</p><p>"You said-!" Ranma cut herself off abruptly. God,   I sound like Akane! All anger dissipated with that single thought. "You're   right. I apologize. Make your wish."</p><p>Tenchi stared at the girl and her abrupt mood swing. "I   just don't know…"</p><p>Ranma considered the student for a moment. Luckily Urd had   prepared her for just such a contingency. Her hand dug into one of the   folds in her robe and pulled out a crinkled scrap of paper, unfolding   it.</p><p>"Ok, maybe this will help. We'll run down the top ten.   Money?"</p><p>"Never really cared about it." Tenchi admitted.</p><p>She went to the next scribbled entry. "Fame?" The   boy shook his head. "Eh, Sex?" She noticed a little heart Urd   had doodle by the entry. Tenchi turned a nice shade of pink. "Right.   Power?" Another negative. Ranma was just about to move further down   the list when her eyes widened. "Oh, DUH!" She exclaimed suddenly,   punching a fist into her palm with a slap. "<i>Chicks!</i>"</p><p>Tenchi face planted into the floor and his Grandfather simply   smiled.</p><p>"WHAT?"</p><p>Ranma didn't know why she hadn't seen it sooner. Actually,   she knew exactly why she hadn't seen it sooner. Unlike most boys his age,   Ranma had women climbing up the walls to get a date her- or him as the   case was -whether she liked it or not. They'd chase Ranma to date Ranma.   They'd fight other girls to date Ranma. Heck, they'd fight <i>Ranma</i> to date Ranma. In fact, she never had to worry about being shy, even though   for all her bravado she had a shy streak a mile wide. Regardless, it had   never been an issue, because the women never stopped bugging him. <i>Ever</i>.   But for Tenchi now, She smiled with the thought, Tenchi was alone over   by that tree for a reason, and it wasn't because he was being chased by   multiple fiancées. Nor had she seen any trying to attach themselves   to him in class. It was just a hunch, but…</p><p>"I'll bet you're lonely."</p><p>"Um, well…" He stared down at his feet, the   light shade of pink returning to his face. He scratched his head thoughtfully.   "It would be nice to have somebody like…" Ranma simply   looked at him, any expression of mischief gone now. He looked into her   neutral blue eyes and produced a shy grin. "Somebody like Mom…"</p><p>The grandfather nodded thoughtfully and Ranma cocked her   head to one side, leaning toward him. "Close, huh?"</p><p>"Not really… She died when I was young." He   answered, and she noted a feeling of sorrow flash through him. Call it   Goddess ESP or whatever, but she could feel it radiate from him, however   briefly. "But I've seen plenty of pictures of dad and her together."   He continued, and the feeling changed to wistful happiness. "They   looked so happy. Like they didn't have a care in the world."</p><p>Ranma stood up and placed her hand gently on Tenchi's shoulder.   He looked up and found a warm smile waiting for him. "Then make your   wish."</p><p>"I wish…" Tenchi hesitated momentarily, thinking   of his mother. "I wish I could just fall in love with a woman that   was, you know… <i>Out of this world!</i>"</p><p>Her instructors had told her what to expect, but she was   also told that would never prepare her for the real thing. As it turns   out, the instructors were right on both accounts. The divine circuit within   her connected and every cell lit up with holy power. Ranma's body went   ridged and she lifted her head skyward, floating lightly off the ground.   That awesome power pulsed outward and the hollow oval mark on her forehead   lit brilliantly as a shaft of pure energy short through the roof of the   Masaki house and climbed into the dusk sky. Something in the beam pulsed   back into Ranma and the circuit inside her was broken. Finally, the beam   disappeared and her power levels returned to normal, allowing the dazed   girl to regain her senses. She blinked and the world came back into focus,   normality restored. She turned to Tenchi, who had jumped across the kitchen   in shock, and smiling once more.</p><p>"Wish Granted."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Chapter 3</b><p><b>I</b>t had taken a bit for Ranma   to convince Tenchi Masaki that was all there was to it, as if a holy shaft   of light sprouting from her forehead wasn't enough. The boy seemed to   think that maybe his dream woman would knock on his door that very night   or something. Maybe she would, Ranma thought wryly, but that wasn't her   concern. Her job as 'the great wish antenna' was done and she happily   assured him that his future wife would probably be along sooner than later,   finally leaving the student to his future. The Goddess of Luck cleared   the surface of the Tendo coy pond without so much as a ripple, satisfied   with the day. It had taken a bit of effort, but she was happy to label   her first day on the job an unqualified success.</p><p>"Oh my!"</p><p>Ranma's attention snapped back into the present to find Kasumi   taking clothes off the yard cloth lines while Akane swept the walkway.   Both were now staring at her. Now why would they be-? Ranma twitched   the glowing wings on her back. Oh yeah. She normally didn't wander around   the dojo in her goddess persona, if only because it made for more comfortable   interaction with the family in general, and she had never appeared before   them with her wing unfurled. The reaction wasn't to be totally unexpected,   she guessed.</p><p>Both sisters walked up to her in curiosity as she stepped   from the pond into the yard, staring at the luminous wings. Ranma shrugged   mentally. Why not? She extended her wings to their full span just so the   sisters could get a good look at them.</p><p>Akane bent under one of them to get a better view. "When   did you get these?"</p><p>"Soft." Kasumi observed as she stroked the wingtip.</p><p>"Uh, I've had em."</p><p>"From the <i>beginning?</i>" Akane asked, a perturbed   look flashing across her face. "Why keep em a secret?"</p><p>"Em, because I was worried certain people would, um,   overreact." Ranma said timidly.</p><p>Akane was about to say something further, then held her toungue.   She was probably right. Around anybody who didn't know her, those wings   would cause quite a stir, and their parents certainly didn't need another   reminder of why they were no longer betrothed. So instead of pushing the   goddess further, she shrugged it off and Ranma produced a thankful smile   in return.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The roulette tables had proven pathetically easy, Ranma thought   as she and her partner in crime departed the establishment 40,000 yen   richer. Nabiki had thought it would be a good lesson in refining Ranma's   improbability talents since both the ball and the wheel itself were in   constant movement counter to the other, thus making a harder target to   predict and alter. The problem was that the Goddess of Luck was gaining   considerable grasp over her powers and it had only taken Ranma two spins   of the wheel before embarking on a half hour winning streak and getting   bored with the game.<p>Which was probably for the best, Nabiki realized. Her contacts   had been relaying whispers of some redheaded gambling queen that had taken   up residence in Nerima's gaming district and that she should be avoided   at all costs. Sure they were still whispers, but word was getting out   and pretty soon Ranma wouldn't be able to walk into a gambling establishment   without being asked to leave.</p><p>"Maybe if they would have put more marbles on the wheel…"   Ranma thought aloud as they walked down by the river and to the bench   they had a month since designated as their break spot between lessons.</p><p>"Oh please." Nabiki brushed the suggestion aside.   "You would have mastered that in another couple of spins anyway."   The two found their bench unoccupied and sat in silence, both merely content   to be around somebody they didn't have to maintain their guard around.   But curiosity was eating the Tendo alive. "Rough day at work?"</p><p>Ranma looked at her with curiosity. "Yeah. How'd you   know?"</p><p>"Well, you didn't bother to change out of your, em,   working attire, and," Nabiki observed the body wrap, then pointed   at the shapely leg she had left crossed and hanging out the side. "You   normally don't slip that much."</p><p>Ranma looked down and sure enough, there was the offending   leg she had unconsciously let hang out in a <i>most</i> feminine manner.   She frowned, but otherwise did nothing to correct the oversight. "The   baka didn't even think I was a Goddess." Ranma grumbled.</p><p>Nabiki was only one step behind Urd in realizing just how   much change Ranma had been dealing with, and while the redhead hadn't   exactly confided with her on the details of that change, she didn't exactly   go through great lengths to hide them around her either, which was a compliment   unto itself.</p><p>"I mean, the baka made me glomp on him." Ranma's   frown turned to mild disgust.</p><p>Nabiki couldn't help but to laugh now. "<i>Made</i> you?"</p><p>The Tendo's laughter helped stabilize her own mood swing.   "Hmmf. Made me. I couldn't exactly break his arm just to make him   wish for something," the Ranma grinned, "So I took a page out   of the Nabiki Bible of Blackmail and Extortion."</p><p>"Ah, embrassement. Clever, Saotome. And a few pages   from the Shampoo Book of Seduction too, it sounds like." Her eyes   narrowed on the goddess, but her tone remained playful. Still, it produced   an unexpected result, causing Ranma's smile to wither away. Nabiki considered   the girl in front of her and came to her own conclusion. "Tommorow   isn't going to be fun, is it?"</p><p>Ranma's leg disappeared into the folds of her wrap and she   looked down at the ground, avoiding eye contact. "No." She looked   into the sister's eyes hesitantly. "I may not know who the one is   for me yet, but I <i>can't</i> let you go against Shampoo unprepared and   that means I'm going to have to push you hard."</p><p>Nabiki looked at her friend in silence. Such a strange girl,   she thought. There was none of the morning's arrogance present whatsoever,   even through the message was basically the same. 'Sensei-mode,' Skuld   had called it; something she'd only see in the dojo. Kind of like me when   I'm out trawling for information. I guess we really are two of a kind   when you look at it that way.</p><p>"Hmf." She sniffed, wearing that 'I got a secret'   smile. "Remember what I told you during the first week I started   helping you study your power?"</p><p>The goddess thought about it for a minute. "That you   only bet on a sure things?" She hazarded.</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Exactly." She pulled herself up   from their bench, then Ranma. "Now let's get back to your studies."   Leaving Ranma to chew on the cryptic reply.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"She's fast." Genma Saotome observed as Nabiki Tendo   ran through another set of the simple kata's Ranma had instructed her   to perform. She had been at it in various stages for over an hour now   and the strain she was under was quite evident. "Maybe faster than   you once she's fully trained."<p>Ranma nodded, sitting off to the side of the mat with his   father. "Not a lot of raw power though. Nowhere close to Akane."</p><p>Genma thought about it for a moment. "Pressure points   then?"</p><p>It had started simply enough; both fathers occasionally dropping   in on their morning practice just to see how the Dojo's first two students   were doing. Instead of the nuisance Ranma thought they were going to be,   both Soun and his father were turning out to be useful sounding boards   when it came to discussing training and tactics concerning Ranma's charges,   and now he often welcomed them to sit in on the sessions. It was almost   as if being removed from the loop entirely had gone a long ways toward   mellowing the elders, or maybe it was just the relief of knowing the dojo   finally had a secure future. Whatever the reason, they had finally become   an asset to the lives of their children instead of a hindrance.</p><p>"No," Ranma rolled the suggestion around in his   head and discarded it. "That's Shampoo's bread and butter. We don't   even want to go there."</p><p>They sat in silence, watching sweat bead off Nabiki's forehead   in earnest now. Her breathing was becoming labored and she would occasionally   snatch glances at the pair as if hoping they'd see the exertion and let   her rest. No such relief came. Every glimpse at Ranma shown those glittering   blue eyes and she knew the redhead would keep her word.</p><p>"Read her Chi levels yet?" The old man asked, breaking   the silence.</p><p>"Yeah. She's a damn battery inside…"</p><p>"…But that's not going to help her much in close   combat without power." Genma finished her thoughts exactly. It was   great for delivering standoff firepower, but when it came down to hand   to hand… "Well boy, you could always try and teacher her the   Cat Fi-"</p><p>Her sharp glare cut him off decisively. Whose dumbass idea   was it to teach a person an unbeatable technique that could only be activated   by psychologically torturing the recipient with nekophobia, anyway? Ranma's   mood darkened quickly. I swear, if I could go back in time and find the   person who developed that technique in the first place-Ranma's eyes suddenly   got wider.</p><p>"Actually, that's not a bad idea…" She mumbled   to herself.</p><p>"What, the Cat Fist? I was joking." Genma stiffened.   "I'm not sure even I'd teach it again to be honest."</p><p>"No, not the technique exactly," Ranma clarified,   clearly animated by the idea now. "But the form itself is absolutely   perfect."</p><p>"It'll be tough replicating the movement and the chi   claws. That's what you learn in the pit, after all. But like you said…"   Genma began to fill in the blanks, seeing where his son was going.</p><p>"…She's a Chi battery." Ranma confirmed.</p><p>"And fast." Genma agreed.</p><p>Nabiki spun through another series of katas, irritably wondering   what the two were chit-chatting about as sweat dripped across her burning   muscles.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma popped out of the heaven-side water fountain at the   usual time, only to find the park notably absent of her best friend. Can't   expect her to be here every day, she thought, and walked to work on her   own. She greeted Deedra, the cherub at the reception desk a good morning   before continuing to her third story office where she found Urd waiting   for her. And Mikasa, a Heavenly Resources Director if she remembered their   brief meeting correctly. It was an interesting contrast, she decided.   On one hand, Urd was wearing a tube top, jacket and short red spandex   skirt while on the other, Mikasa was sporting a white business shirt,   gray blazer and knee-high skirt. It was rather ironic, in her opinion,   that neither wardrobe did much to hide the women's figures. Their idle   chatter stopped instantly as Ranma stepped into the room, both staring   at her.<p>"Um, morning Urd. Director." Bother returned her   smile. Ok, let's just get this out of the way, she thought. "Look,   it wasn't my fault he was being so dang stubborn!"</p><p>"Oh I don't know." Urd grinned. "Looked like   you had him- oh, I mean <i>the situation</i> well in hand."</p><p>"You were watching me?" Ranma squealed indignantly.</p><p>"Of course I was watching you!" Urd planted her   hands on her hips as if she were affronted by the insinuation. "I'm   not about to let my student and best friend go out on her first live wish   without backup."</p><p>"And you just watched me glomp on him for the better   part of a half and hour?" the redhead fumed, thoroughly embarrassed   now.</p><p>"<i>Yeaaah</i>." Her sister replied in a self-satisfied   tone. "You made such a <i>cute</i> couple."</p><p>"I so, <i>so</i> hate you."</p><p>"Enough to go get a glass of sake with me after work?"   Urd winked.</p><p>Ranma shrugged in defeat. "Sure, why not."</p><p>"And a good first wish from the report I've received."   Mikasa finally injected herself into the conversation. "Though infiltrating   the boy's classes just out of spite was a bit over the top."</p><p>"He asked for it." The redhead grumbled.</p><p>Mikasa chuckled softly. "Maybe, but I'm not here to   hammer you on the minor details. You got the wish and a good one at that."   Ranma was just starting to beam when she continuted. "But."</p><p>Urd chuckled. "There's always a catch."</p><p>Ranma's smile disappeared. "But what?"</p><p>"But Tenchi Masaki should have been out of your jurisdiction   entirely." Mikasa stated, arms folding across her chest.</p><p>Ranma shot a questioning look at both women. "He's an   alien." Urd supplied.</p><p>"One forth Jurai, to be exact." Director Mikasa   specified. "From his Mother and Grandfather."</p><p>"He didn't look alien to me. Neither did his Grandfather."   Ranma was now thoroughly confused. "Do aliens even get wishes?"</p><p>Mikasa nodded. "Yes they do in fact, but that's normally   handled by their own world office."</p><p>"So… There would be separate Goddess offices for   different worlds then?" Ranma ventured, trying to grasp the politics   of wish granting.</p><p>"Indeed." Mikasa agreed, turning back to Ranma.   "You can't grant a wish made by somebody actually living on another   planet. They have their own Goddess office for that because they know   the customs and such."</p><p>"So how did I get Tenchi's wish again?" Ranma looked   from one Goddess to the other.</p><p>"That's a good question." Urd remarked, as if to   compliment her again.</p><p>"You don't know." Ranma replied dryly.</p><p>"Not a clue."</p><p>"It's like the Yggradsil routed the call to the wrong   office accidentally." Mikasa clicked her long red nails on Ranma's   desk.</p><p>"Except…" Urd continued.</p><p>"There are no mistakes." Ranma finished, remembering   her conversation with Kami-sama quite clearly.</p><p>"Right." Mikasa confirmed both their suppositions.   "Which means we're pulling you off the phones for now so that you   can keep an eye on Tenchi and his wish."</p><p>"What!" Ranma's tone soured. "I don't wanna   baby-sit him! It took me half a day to convince him I was a Goddess and   then he made me glomp on him!"</p><p>"You break it you buy it." Urd quipped with amusement.</p><p>Ranma shot a glare at her sister, but Director Mikasa intervened   before she could produce a retort. "What she means is that with Tenchi   being one quarter Jurai, the Yggradsil would take the content of his wish   quite seriously."</p><p>Ranma's temper cooled just enough to consider his wish-   '<i>I wish I could just fall in love with a woman that was, you know…   Out of this world!</i>' Her eyes widened suddenly in disbelief.</p><p>"You've got to be kidding me!"</p><p>"Now do ya see?" Urd remarked, driving the point   home. "The Yggradsil will move all of creation to make that wish   come to pass. Literally."</p><p>"And he doesn't even know his heritage." Mikasa   added.</p><p>"And you can't tell him." Urd finished, still clearly   amused.</p><p>Ranma viewed both Goddess with a dead look. "Oh, this   is just <i>great.</i>"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The Lost Boy stepped out of the jungle and crumbled the travel   guide in disgust. These pyramids were not on the map, he noted with some   resentment. Of course, the fact that he was reading it upside down wasn't   helping matters any. That, and the fact that it was a map of Paris further   complicated the issue. If he ever found the vendor that sold him such   a plainly mismarked map- which wasn't likely -He'd kill him! Ryoga sighed.   Akari-chan was going to kill him for being home late. Three months late.<p>"Whoa, nice place you found here!"</p><p>Ryoga spun around at the female timber and found Ranma. Standing   a few feet away, taking in the sights and greenery. "Kinda hot though.   And steamy." She amended, turning her attention back to the boy in   front of her.</p><p>Hate bubbled up from within Ryoga at the sight of the redhead,   but unlike their past encounters, didn't hold. He sized up the Ranma standing   in front of him who now wore her Goddess attire, a reminder that the dynamics   of their relationship had changed dramatically. She was no longer engaged   to Akane, which had been a major source of hostilitiy between the two.   She could no longer even be considered a rival anymore given her new station   and the fact that no matter how hard he trained, he would never come close   to touching the power she now wielded. So instead of towering anger he   would normally feel for her at this moment, only a burbling of resentment   made its way to the surface of his face.</p><p>She ambled over to the Lost Boy easily and offered him the   glass of ice water that she had been holding. Ranma noticed the disgruntled   look on his face. "Look, truce already, ok?"</p><p>Ryoga eyed the redhead once more and snatched the glass out   of her hands, drinking it down greedily. Satisfaction replaced his sour   mask, only to be replaced with suspicion seconds later. "What do   you want, Ranma?" It wasn't hostility, but it was close.</p><p>Ranma sighed. "A truce. Ryoga, that's all."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Now the redhead was getting irritated. "Because I've   got better things to do than to argue over a rivalry that doesn't hold   a lick of meaning anymore."</p><p>"Are you saying I wasn't <i>good enough</i> to be your   rival!" Ryoga growled, his words taking on a sharp edge.</p><p>Ranma's eyes flashed with heat, but softened just as quickly.   "I'm saying I <i>can't</i> be your rival anymore." She unfurled   her luminous wings to drive the point home, chopping down Ryoga's anger   at the source.</p><p>Ryoga opened his mouth, then closed it, watching the wings   quiver slightly around Ranma. Her voice… It was almost… Sad?   Why would she be-? It was at that moment he realized just how much they   had lost with the rivalry. Three years of vengeance, dueling and mutual   combat. Through it, both had gained in skill and power. And respect. Even   in their darkest hours, one could rely on the other to come to their aid,   however grudgingly. And in all that time, Ranma had never once betrayed   him or his curse to Akane. In some twisted way, they had become brothers   and Ryoga finally realized how deep the loss of that rivalry cut into   Ranma. And himself.</p><p>He took a deep breath, looking into Ranma's blue eyes "Ok,   Truce." Ranma's wings extended happily with her bright smile and   Ryoga was momentarily taken back. There was definitely some girl in there   now, he realized with some surprise. This was really going to take some   getting used to. His grudging brother and rival had become… A sister?</p><p>"Good." Ranma began happily, digging into the folds   of her robe. "Because now I can give you this." She thrust a   hand toward him and he stared. She was giving him…</p><p>"…A watch?" Ryoga took it, turning the oversized   wrist device over to examine it. "Um, uh, thanks… I guess."</p><p>Ranma looked annoyed. "Not just a watch, dummy! See   those two big buttons on the face?" Ryoga flipped it upright and   saw one blue and one green button, both taking up more space than the   display itself. "The Blue one is keyed to the dojo. The green one   is keyed to your house."</p><p>"A compass?" He asked, staring at the watch with   irritation. "Compasses hate me."</p><p>Ranma folded her arms and shook her head with a wide grin.   "Nope. Skuld couldn't make<i> just</i> a compass." The Lost   Boy looked, well, lost, so Ranma clarified. "What you are holding   in your hands is a teleportation device keyed to your house and the Tendo   dojo." Ryoga nearly dropped it in shock. "She originally designed   it to be the size of your backpack, but once I convinced her it only had   to go two places, she was able to get it down to a considerably smaller   size."</p><p>"So if I press this button…?"</p><p>"You get zapped strait back to your house." Ranma   beamed, almost as much as Skuld had when she present her sister with the   finished product. "No matter how lost you get, you've always got   a way home now."</p><p>Ryoga was quite literally speechless. His biggest obstacle   to happiness and Ranma had just… He just let his mouth hang open.   Of course, the thought had crossed his mind as to whether it was safe   to be zapping ones self around the world, but that was instantly crushed   under the bigger picture. He had a predictable, reliable way home!</p><p>Ranma watched Ryoga's face transform from awe to sheer joy.   It warmed her heart. After all they had been through together he deserved   this small thing. It was a very un-Ranma like thought, but she felt it   nonetheless.</p><p>Finally she interrupted his joyous revelation. "Well?"</p><p>Ryoga looked at the gift bearing Goddess, who now had a twinkle   in her eye. "Well what?"</p><p>An impish smile crawled across her face slowly. "Now   that you have a way home, aren't you going to ask me why you have a button   for <i>the dojo?</i>"</p><p>He asked. She told him. Ryoga Hibiki nearly passed out.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's Notes:</b><p><i><b>I</b> have to admit, I'm having   considerably more fun writing No Need For Goddesses! if only because   I'm allowed to really thicken the plot beyond the first series. Of course,   it's also fun to play with the three-way crossover here and it's taking   directions I hadn't even originally planned. Hope you've enjoyed it   so far. I'm really looking forward to writing the next chapters.</i></p><p><b>Timeline;</b><br/><i> With the Ranma and Goddess timelines already in progress, I decided   it would just be better to start the Tenchi timeline from the very beginning.   The main reason for this being that unlike the first two, Tenchi tends   to jump around all over the place. One moment they're on earth, the   next in space and so forth. This way I can isolate them on earth so   that all three series can interact there. Likewise, it meshes well with   Ranma's job. If we join the tenchi timeline in progress, we'd have characters   tripping over themselves wishing Tenchi as their husband :p</i></p><p><b>About Nabiki</b> (vs Shampoo)<br/><i> I honestly never intended Nabiki/Shampoo thing to have as big of a role   as it's currently scripted in this series. It's the result of my writing   style, where I map out my critical plot points but allow the little   subplots and details to be written on the fly and run wild. Nabiki's   kiss in </i>Improbable Goddess<i> was added in on a total whim and just   for fun …Until I realized what that little kiss meant if carried   to it's logical conclusion. I have to say I'm liking where that conclusion   is leading, even if I never planned it out that way. I think you will   too. Don't worry; Shampoo won't be neglected by any means. Expect it   in 4-9</i></p><p><b>Rewrites;</b><br/><i> The series was going to involve a wish concerning Ryoko as well, but   I ultimately decided that one wish that could bind the entire cast would   be for the best. Frankly, it was just too messy having two cast members   coincidentally receiving a wish so close to one another. For anybody   wondering, her wish would have been to just get out of that stinking   cave! That, and if I made her the primary wish recipient over Tenchi,   Ranma would be tasked to watch over and favor her over other fiancées.   I wasn't quite ready to go in that direction, while giving Tenchi a   wish mid-series would just be all sorts of trouble as well.</i></p>
