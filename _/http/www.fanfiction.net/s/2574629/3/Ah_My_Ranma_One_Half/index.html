</div><p><b>Oh My Ranma ½!<br/>The Improbable Goddess</b><br/>Stared: 15Jul05<br/>Finished: 05Aug05<br/>By Ozzallos</p><p><b>Chapter SEVEN</b></p><p><b>R</b>anma found her friends staring at  her as if they had seen a ghost. Or maybe not a ghost, she amended, since they  probably saw those all the time. "Well <i>that </i>was fun."</p><p>Belldandy nodded.  "Um, Ranma… We need to talk."</p><p>"Of course." She  replied amiably. "What's on your mind?"</p><p>"The question really  is," Urd interjected, "What's on your mind."</p><p>Ranma thought about it for  a moment. "Hmm… I think I'm just going nuts."</p><p>"You're so calm about  it," Skuld observed dryly.</p><p>Ranma patted the teen on  the head with a smile. "That's exactly how I know!"</p><p>"How long have you  been holding this back?" Belldandy asked, touching Ranma lightly.</p><p>Another pause. "Since  the day I realized I couldn't change back." Ranma clutched her head as if  she had a headache. "And I'm trying to keep control. FIGHTING TO KEEP  CONTROL." Her voice raised from a calm feminine demeanor to aggravation.</p><p>Belldandy pulled her  close. "It's not something to be controlled, Ran-chan. It just is."</p><p>"But I'm losing <i>me</i>…"  Ranma gritted her teeth. "I'm a guy up here but a girl down there… And I  can feel the girl… SNEAKING IN…"</p><p>"How so?" Urd  tentatively asked, hoping to get a clearer picture of the problem.</p><p>A strained grin crept across  the tortured redhead's face. "You're right, for example… He <i>is</i>  cute." Urd shot a sidelong glance to the defeated Amazon boy now being  carried off. Ranma's hand clutched her head again. "That's just NOT the  right thing to think!"</p><p>Urd took Ranma from her  sister to face her. "Ranma? Listen to me." Slowly Ranma stopped  clutching her head. The strain was still evident in her face, however. "Do  you trust me?" Ranma nodded ever so slightly. "Because right now, I  absolutely need you to trust me. Can you do that?" A single tear rolled  down Ranma's cheek. Another nod.</p><p>"Good. Let me tell  you a story... It's about a little girl named Urd. Little Urd wanted to be a  goddess very badly, but she had a dark side. A <i>demonic</i> side, in  fact." The woman she was holding stilled. "Both sides fought in her  mind. Lashed out. Raged from one extreme to another. Much like you. It was a  constant tug of war, and like you, it began to take its toll. Two people can't  live in the same body, Ranma, and that's what we were doing. I did it then and  you're doing it now. We put so much pressure on one end of the scale that the  other becomes unbalanced and goes berserk. Soon it becomes unbearable and comes  back down again even harder than before. The cycle repeats until we crack. Does  that make sense?"</p><p>Ranma nodded, sorrow and  tears still in her eyes, but she held eye contact. "Only by opening myself  to both sides was I able to still the madness. Only by not forcing one side or  the other was I able to achieve some measure of peace. Both had to give ground,  but neither was extinguished. Instead, they became whole. Complete. Are you  willing to give that a try, Ran-chan?"</p><p>"Y-Yes." She  sniffled. "I think so…"</p><p>"The male in you is  going to have to give ground to find peace." Urd warned. "Can you do  that?" A silent nod. "Likewise, the female you are won't have total  reign either. You must become one person. It won't happen over night. You will  have urges, but you can't suppress them. Control them, yes. Shape them, yes.  Recognize and acknowledge their existence, yes. But you cannot under any  circumstances shut them out."</p><p>"It… It will take  some getting used to." Ranma admitted shakily. "I'm still scared I'll  be washed away."</p><p>Belldandy stroked her hair  gently. "That can never happen Ran-chan. That is your very being. Your  Soul. It can never be washed away,"</p><p>Ranma stood up a little  straighter with her words. "R-Really?"</p><p>"Promise."</p><p>Ranma took both their  hands with a weak smile. "Thank you… Onee-chans."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki  peeked into the dojo silently, looking for a certain redhead who had yet to  come for breakfast. Sure enough, Skuld and Akane were right; Their sensei had  dismissed them from practice, with a promise to join them at the table later.  The middle sister was once again in information gathering mode. The goddesses  had not gotten home until late last night, and when they did, they seemed to be  sheltering a very fragile looking Ranma. Now she sat in the middle of the dojo  mat, eyes glued to the ground in front of her. Nabiki focused on the same spot …It  was a ten yen piece. What was she…<p>"Spying again?"  Ranma's voice broke her attention from the coin to the redhead's neutral stare.</p><p>"Well, you came home  late last night and you never miss breakfast…" Nabiki ventured, stepping  into the dojo. She didn't add exactly<i> what</i> she saw. "What  gives?"</p><p>Ranma's eyes returned to  the coin in front of her. "Just have a lot on my mind."</p><p>"I can imagine…"  The sister replied softly, then realized in surprise that she was actually  sympathizing with Ranma. It was getting harder not to, she thought, especially  after seeing her condition last night.</p><p>Ranma looked up at Nabiki.  She knew. Probably not about her breakdown last night, but she knew a whole lot  more than she should. "You going to sell that information too?"</p><p>Nabiki winced.  "Um…." Ranma snorted her gaze returned to the coin. A change of  subject was in order. "What's with the coin?" Ranma remained silent,  fixated on the disk. Nabiki laughed softly, breaking her concentration.  "Honestly, I don't know how much information I can continue to sell on  you. It's all getting just too weird."</p><p>She stared at the Tendo's  smile. Was that her way of declaring a truce? Or a trap? Ranma decided to step  a bit out on faith. She picked up the thin coin and flipped it into the air.  "Heads." She stated before it landed in her waiting palm. Nabiki took  a few steps closer and sure enough, it was. Ranma flipped the coin again.  "Heads." Nabiki smiled. Right again. Lucky. Ranma knew what she was  thinking, and flipped the coin again. "Tails." The sister blinked. It  was. Again.</p><p>She eyed the sitting girl  warily. "A martial arts trick." Ranma smiled, shaking her head and  then tossed the coin to her. Nabiki flipped it this time.</p><p>"Heads." She  flipped it again. "Tails." And again. "Tails." Flip.  "Heads." Flip. "Tails." Flip. "Tails." She stared  at Ranma who simple smiled back. An evil grin crept across Nabiki's face and  she threw the coin across the dojo where it bounced off the wall and skittered  around on the floor. Ranma was looking at her the entire time with that smile.  "Heads." The coin came to a rest several feet away and the sister  walked over to collect it. She stopped just as her fingers were about ready to  pluck it from the ground. Heads.</p><p>Her head whipped around to  Ranma, whose smile had already spread wider. "All right, Saotome what  gives?"</p><p>The redhead held out her  hand her smile instantly dissolving into seriousness. "2000 yen."  Nabiki was seriously considering the offer when the smile reappeared. She  obviously had no intension of enforcing it. Nabiki sat by Ranma as she  explained, "I don't know how to explain it, but I can see what it's going  to be. No matter how much it tumbles and bounces, I know how it's going to land  the moment it leaves your fingers."</p><p>"And how long has  this been…"</p><p>"I started to notice  it yesterday, but really didn't know what I was seeing until practice this  morning." Ranma elaborated. "I found myself predicting random events,  such as how Skuld's hammer would rebound and how the pieces of Akane's broken  cinder blocks would fall." Nabiki nodded. It was tough to believe, but  what she said next was even more unbelievable. "I think I can even  influence those outcomes." Ranma added quietly.</p><p>It had always been a given  that Nabiki's mind worked like a steel trap, and the moment of disbelief she  experienced upon hearing that last sentence quickly dissolved into absolute  clarity as several pieces of information clicked. "Of course you can  predict my coin tosses," She said with confidence, now that all of those  facts had pointed to one inescapable conclusion. "You're the Goddess of  Luck after all, right? I'll bet predicting coins is child's play compared to  what you can really do. I can't say I'm surprised you didn't realize it sooner  considering all you've been going through and especially after last nig-"  She stopped herself with Ranma's frown. She had just touched an open wound.  "Um, look. I'm sorry. It's just…"</p><p>"Who else have you  told?" Ranma asked, a hint of sorrow in her voice.</p><p>"Only Akane."  She replied softly.</p><p>"Does she know  anything about last night?" Ranma probed.</p><p>"N-No. I haven't told  her." Nabiki didn't add that she had planned to.</p><p>"Please don't."</p><p>Nabiki regarded her  silently. "Alright." Ranma's foreboding mood showed signs of lifting.  "But on one condition. I get to train you."</p><p>Ranma's surprise was  total. Nabiki? Train me? "I, uh, um, Why?"</p><p>The sister smiled coolly.  "Because you're the Goddess of Luck. Statistics. Probabilities. Chance.  Numbers play no small part in Luck, and while you may be a genius in Martial  Arts, I'm the genius with numbers. The logical conclusion is that I train YOU  in this area of your studies." Unasked questions were practically  radiating from Ranma. "That, and I have my own reasons. You have your  secrets, I have mine. Fair enough?" Ranma nodded. "Then I'll see you  after school for your first lesson."</p><p>And with that, the two  walked out together in an unlikely alliance.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b><i>CRACK!</i></b><p>The entire family jumped  as a flash of light filled the dining room. Granted, such occurrences were  becoming more and more commonplace, but lightning bolts in the back yard on a  clear blue day weren't exactly everyday occurrences. Everybody rushed out to  gather around the smoking crater, only to find out it wasn't a crater after  all, but a tablet with strange writing on it.</p><p>Genma pointed at the  smoldering block. "Eh, what's that?"</p><p>Belldandy knelt down.  "A message from Kami-sama!" The entire family took a step back. As if  the goddesses weren't enough, their courtyard had just been turned into sacred  ground. "Oh my. Urd, Skuld, you'd better have a look at this…"</p><p>Urd looked down on it and  took a step back as well. "A recall notice?"</p><p>"An investigation  into the promotion of a mortal to First Class, Category One unlimited?"  Skuld read the tablet in confusion. "B-But, I thought they were fine with  it!"</p><p>Her older sister scowled.  "Fine with the result but not how it occurred, I'll bet." She sighed.  "Looks like we're leaving today. Sis, can you look after Ranma for  me?" She left out the reasons she needed looking after due to the present  company.</p><p>Belldandy smiled. "Of  course."</p><p>"I'm not  coming?" Ranma asked as Urd turned to leave. " I am, after all, the  result of this mix-up."</p><p>Urd winked. "Sorry,  kid, Invitation only. I'll be back before you know it."</p><p>Skuld gave Ranma a hug and  jumped into the koi pond, vanishing. With one last look, Urd walked inside and  vanished into the TV.</p><p>Ranma looked after them in  concern, then to Belldandy. "What will they do in this  investigation?"</p><p>Belldandy looked at Ranma.  She really didn't want to tell her, because… "They will examine the case  and determine if Urd and Skuld acted in a proper manner concerning your  file."</p><p>"And if they decide  they acted improperly?" Ranma pressed.</p><p>The goddess really didn't  like where this was going. She knew Ranma and Urd shared a strong bond and that  both would probably go to the ends of the Earth for the other. "They could  easily find that their actions were correct, Ranma."</p><p>Nabiki, who had been  listening to the entire exchange, walked to Ranma's side. "You're avoiding  the question." Her support didn't go unnoticed by either Kasumi or Akane.</p><p>Belldandy sighed. "In  the event that they do find wrong-doing, they would be… Punished."  Something changed in Ranma's eyes. It was that something she was hoping to  avoid.</p><p>"What sort of  punishment?"</p><p>Belldandy looked down.  "Anything from a simple reprimand to…" She hesitated. The look in  Ranma's eyes… "To reduction of rank or even being barred from surface  contact."</p><p>"But if they reverse  me back to mortal…" Ranma stood, plainly stunned.</p><p>"Then you would never  see her again."</p><p>Silence. A look of  determination spread across her face. "Can I use the TV like Urd?"</p><p>"No, your transport  medium is water, just like-" Belldandy realized she had just said too much.  "Ranma, what are you planning to do?" As if she need to ask, Ranma  heading toward the pond herself. "You really aren't ready to try that  Ranma, you need to-"</p><p><i>Shloosh!</i></p><p>She was gone.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Even as  her feet touched the water, Ranma realized she had no idea how to control this  particular ability. Her legs dissolved into the water, then her waist. Maybe if  she just thought of the place. Heaven. She wanted an absolute firm fix in her  mind. What else was in Heaven? Angels. And as her head sank below the surface, Ranma  repeated those two words in her mind over and over so there could be no mistake  in where she was going. She closed her eyes and the twisting came. She felt it  inside and out, but she continued to repeat the word in her mind.<p>The twisting stopped. She  opened her eyes and found herself in the center of a small lake, lightly  touching its glass surface. Around her was a beautiful forest with the tallest  trees she had ever seen, stretching up for miles and miles until disappearing into  the misty clouds. The occasional bird flitted overhead whistling a song. Total  peace. She was sure she had arrived in heaven, but where? It had to be a huge  place! Ranma saw a woman near the shore, tending to some plants. Maybe she  could help. The redhead noted she was now in her goddess attire as she took her  first tentative steps across the crystal lake surface. The robe was different  now, somewhere in between the conservative first transformation and the  provocative dress of her mental breakdown. She had the urge to change it, but  remembering Urd's words on balance, let it go. At least her ponytail remained  in place of the unbound waves or red hair.</p><p>Ranma stepped onto grassy  land and the woman turned around, noticing she had company. Her beautiful frilly  white dress complimented the waves of blonde locks that rested gently around  her shoulders perfectly. Her green eyes blinked with curiosity and she smiled.</p><p>The blond goddess stood  up, her height towering over Ranma by nearly two feet. "Good day to you! I  don't believe we've met. My name is Charlotte."</p><p>She took the gentle hand  the goddess had proffered. "Ranma. Nice to meet you." Charlotte's  smile widened. "I seem to be a bit… Um, lost."</p><p>That fact did nothing to  diminish Charlotte's smile. "You find yourself in the Garden of Angels,  and you've come at a good time!"</p><p>"Well, I'm not  exactly supposed to be here…" Ranma said nervously. "I'm loo-"</p><p>"Of course you are  supposed to be here!" the Blonde goddess corrected cheerfully. "The  only people who come are those who are supposed to be here." She took  Ranma's hand and began leading her away from the lake towards a patch blooming  with flowers. Charlotte turned back toward Ranma and gave her a silent  "Shhhhhh…"</p><p>Ranma looked at the patch  of flowering beauty unsure of what she was looking for. Most of the flower had  bloomed into a wide variety of colors while some had yet to. Charlotte squeezed  her hand lightly and pointed to one of the unopened flower heads. "That  one!" she whispered with delight.</p><p>Ranma took a step, then  hesitated. "Are you sure abo-"</p><p>The goddess nudged her  forward, giggling. "Of course I'm sure! That one is SO you!"</p><p>Ranma took the remaining  to the unopened bud, peering at it curiously. Ok, so it's a flower. What do I-  Even as she watched, the bud opened before her very eyes and at the center of  the light blue flower was- An egg! It was a tiny egg to be sure, but  definitely an egg. She looked back at Charlotte.</p><p>"Pick it up!"  Charlotte urged with excitement. Ranma plucked the tiny egg tentatively from  the new blossom and examined it. What was in such a tiny egg, Ranma wondered.  Would it hatch a hummingbird or something? A tiny rabbit? Maybe a-"</p><p>"Swallow it!"</p><p>"WHAT?" Ranma  spun around, looking at Charlotte like she had just grown a second head. Which she  might as well have done, Ranma figured since she had just instructed her to  swallow the egg as if it were a piece of candy. She was about to ask if the  blonde was serious, but one look at her cheery face forestalled that question  before it even came out. Oh why the heck not? I mean, how much stranger could  it possibly get at this point? Ranma thought. Promoted to Goddess, locked in  her girl-type, attacked by demons, sneaking into heaven… Swallowing a tiny egg  like Alice in Wonderland was par for the course, right? With on last look at  the tall goddess, Ranma popped it into her mouth like a pill.</p><p>At first she didn't feel a  thing. Then the pressure began. She felt warm and the pressure grew. Ranma put  her hands to her heart, every beat feeling like it would explode. But she  wasn't scared. Each beat outward pulsed peace and contentment. Then, her heart  burst. The whirlwind exploded forth around her and Ranma squinted on reflex  until the motion faded. Finally, she opened her eyes to an incredible sight… A  petite girl with waving red hair and pale skin floating in front of her, a  wondrous smile on her face.</p><p>She heard a name in her  heart. "F-Feather Light?"</p><p>The little girl nodded  happily and stretched her silken wings. They were nearly pure white, except for  the soft brownish red spots at the tips. The girl gave Ranma a little kiss on  the head and flitted skyward in a whirlwind to test her new wings. The Goddess  of Luck could only stare in amazement.</p><p>"What just…"  Ranma stumbled for words.</p><p>"She's your angel,  silly!" Charlotte beamed with pride. "You're lucky you came along  when you did. She's a beauty!"</p><p>Ranma watched the angel  drift through the forest sky with ease. "What... what do I do with it?  What does it eat?"</p><p>Charlotte considered Ranma  for a bit with a light smile, then shrugged. "She is a part of you, a  helper in anything and everything. She is the light of your heart manifest and  as long as that is full, she will never worry for anything. What did you say  her name was?"</p><p>"Feather Light."  She couldn't even forget the name if she tried, she realized. The sound of her  name brought the angel back down to Ranma, who simply stared. "She's  beautiful…" Feather Light bounced in the air happily at the compliment  then glided over to Charlotte with a curious expression on her face.</p><p>"Why hello there  Feather Light!" She greeted the angel, whose smile reappeared instantly.  "My you are a beautiful one! Please take very good care of Ranma,  Ok?" Again the angel nodded with enthusiasm. Charlotte turned back to  Ranma. "I expect you have to go now…"</p><p>Ranma's gaze snapped from  Feather Light to Charlotte. "You're right! Uh, how do I get out of  here?"</p><p>Charlotte pointed.  "Follow the main path through the trees until you get to the big  gates."</p><p>Ranma turned for the path  and paused, She walked over to the smiling Charlotte and pulled her into a hug.  "Thank you."</p><p>The goddess returned the  hug warmly. "Feel free to drop by when you're not so busy!" Ranma  matched her smile and nodded, then was off down off the path. The angel  remained behind for a second and gave her a peck on the head, then she too was  gone.</p><p>"Such a wonderful  heart she has."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The gates,  as it turned out were as huge as any earthbound skyscraper. They were ivory and  gold, and beyond them Heaven teemed with activity. It was a major metropolis as  far as the eye could see, disappearing and reappearing into the rolling white  clouds. Ranma looked at Feather Light, who was in awe as well. "I think  I'm in WAY over my head here…" It was going to take several eternities to  find the two people she was looking for. Granted, she was a goddess and  effectively immortal, but… Then she remembered Charlotte's words; A helper in  anything and everything. "Feather Light, I know it's our first time here,  but can <i>you</i> help me find Urd and Skuld?" The angel considered this  for a second then nodded, and flew into the glorious sky that framed eternity.<p>Urd had almost fallen  asleep in her chair when Skuld nudged her violently, waking her up with a  start. Dang, where were again? Oh yeah. The Goddess Review Board.</p><p>"…Violation of  section 345a of the Yggradsil operating procedures. Unauthorized tampering of  the Yggradsil file network without sufficient authorization…"</p><p>Bah, they were still going  over all the rules they had broken restoring Ranma's file. Urd was just about  to drift back to sleep when a rush of air snapped her awake. What was…? In the  middle of the room floated an angel, having gained access to the Reviewing room  through an open window. Waving red hair. Blue eyes. Bespeckled wings. And a  clearly amused look on its face. Then angel floated over to one of the three  reviewers desks, peering intently at the person behind it.</p><p>"What is the meaning  of this! We are trying to conduct official business here," the reviewer  snapped at the angel, who pulled back slightly with a frown. "Does anybody  know who this angel belongs to!"</p><p>The angel pulled back  completely and scanned the room for the people she was looking for. Urd watched  as it made eye contact with her, and the angels bright smile returned. It  flitted over to her desk and radiated triumph, then floated over to Skuld with  the same look of satisfaction. And before they could say anything, it flew back  out the window from whence it came.</p><p>Skuld looked over to her  older sister. "Did that look like…?"</p><p>"No, it couldn't be.  She's stuck on Earth with Bell-chan." At least Urd was fairly sure she was  stuck on Earth. Because if Ranma wasn't, and that angel… nah. Couldn't be.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma had  followed Feather Light into legal district of heaven and found the reviewing  office Urd and Skuld were being interrogated in. Well, that probably wasn't  true, but she was determined to help represent her friends.<p>She walked up the steps  and was about to enter the main hall when the doorman stopped her. "I'm  sorry, but you must dismiss her before entering." Ranma stared at the man  for a moment, before realizing he meant Feather Light. The Doorman looked  apologetic. "Not my rule, just they cause too much of a distraction during  proceedings. I'm sure you understand."</p><p>"Uh, yeah… 'dismiss  her'." Ranma had no idea how to 'dismiss' Feather Light. She leaned over  to the floating angel beside her and whispered, "Any idea what he  means?" Feather Light nodded, lifted into the sky and arced into Ranma,  absorbing into her person with a soft glow. She could even feel her inside now,  glowing. Content.</p><p>The Doorman nodded as if  he saw that sort of thing everyday and stepped aside. Ranma smiled as if she  did that everyday and walk through the door he was holding open. A few minutes  later and guided by Feather Light's tugs at her heart, Ranma found it: Room  103.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Urd and  Skuld now stood in front to the three Reviewers. "We hope you understand  the nature of your activities. The Yggradsil isn't simply a toy to be tinkered  with, ladies." The first reviewer began. She was a kind but stern old  bitty with brown hair. The second reviewer, a middle-aged man with gray hair  piped up. "Indeed. We will give you one minute to make a closing statement  before we finalize judgment."<p>Skuld had no idea what to  say. This had been the first time she had ever been to a Goddess Review Board  and she was already starting off on the wrong foot with them. Her entire  future-Urd stepped forward, interrupting her thoughts in surprise.</p><p>"I would like to make  a statement." The first reviewer nodded for her to continue. "I would  like to state for the record that this is all my doing. Any actions Skuld took  were taken because I ordered them so using my rank as Goddess second class. She  even objected to some of them." Like to Ranma being Goddess of Sex, but  they didn't need to know that. "My actions should not be counted against  her record as she had no choice but to comply. That is all."</p><p>Skuld looked at her sister  in awe. She was going to deliberately take everything upon her shoulders. She  wanted to protest- Urd shot her a look to keep quiet.</p><p>The third reviewer spoke  up this time. "We appreciate your honesty in this matter Goddess Urd. We  will consider reducing her punishment in light of this information, but yours  of course, stands. We have decided that a reduction of rank is in order to that  of-"</p><p>"Objection, your  Honor."</p><p>Urd and Skuld's eyes  widened simultaneously. It was absolutely impossible. They spun around to find  Ranma in the doorway. Urd's eyes were now screaming "what are you doing  here?" while Skuld's shown pure delight.</p><p>"You object?"  The third director choked incredulously. "You can't object! These are  closed proceedings! You're not even supposed to be here!"</p><p>"Yes, please leave at  once, young lady." The first director ordered.</p><p>Instead, Ranma smiled  arrogantly and walked up the aisle to join her friends, whose mouths still hung  open.</p><p>The second director  sighed. "Bailiff, please remove our guest."</p><p>With that, a slim  dishwater blonde male with wings moved to intercept the redhead and Urd snapped  out of her trance. Oh crap, Ranma didn't come all this way to be kicked out…</p><p>The bailiff stood in front  of Ranma and put his hand lightly on her arm and smiled. "I'm sorry,  Miss-"</p><p>Ranma smiled back and  flipped the arm he had just touched around, breaking contact and establishing  her own grip in one easy motion. Even as his eyes registered shock, she  reversed the joint and took the arm behind its owners' back, locking it in  place. Two well placed kicks behind the knees sent the struggling bailiff to  the floor and onto his chest. Ranma leaned down closer to his face.  "Struggling will only make it hurt more." He struggled and she  brought the arm back further, hyper-extending the joint. The bailiff grunted in  pain. "Trust me when I say this is hurting me more than you." She  frowned, and then chopped the back of his neck, knocking him out cold. Ranma  stood back up with a cheerful smile on her face and joined the sisters in front  of the bench.</p><p>Urd turned to her best  friend in annoyance. "Why do you always have to inflict bodily harm on the  cute ones?</p><p>"Because they ask for  it!" Ranma protested, face growing red.</p><p>"You're into the pain  thing, huh?" Urd continued ruthlessly.</p><p>Ranma gasped, now complete  embarrassed, "Don't make me regret coming here!"</p><p>"Whips and chains and  other kinky-"</p><p>"AHEM." The  first Reviewer cleared her throat forcefully, gaining the goddesses' undivided  attention. "Since you're intent on staying and disrupting these  proceedings, Miss, please tell us your name and why you are here."</p><p>"Yes, so when the  Valkyries show up to detain you," The third reviewer continued,  "they'll have something for the official arrest report."</p><p>Having had enough time to  recover from terminal embarrassment, Ranma stepped forward. "I am Ranma,  Goddess of Luck First Class, Category one, unlimited." It was the first  time she had ever used her official title, but if there was any day to throw it  around, it was today. "I am here in defense of Goddess Urd and Goddess  Skuld."</p><p>Understanding dawned on  the Second Reviewer. "So you're the result of their mishandling of this  entire situation. Your clearly violent tendencies are the first and most  obvious reason this should have never-"</p><p>"EXCUSE ME," It  was Ranma's turn to forcefully interject. "Exactly why am I still a Goddess  then?"</p><p>"That has absolutely  no releva-"</p><p>"I beg to  differ," Ranma interrupted once more. "Much to my personal annoyance,  my Revocation was denied five to one. Why do you suppose that is?"</p><p>"You're  Revoca-"</p><p>"Are you familiar  with the name Saffron?" She continued unabated and the question hung in an  air of silence.</p><p>A thin smile crept across  Urds face. Of course they are. This very board would have been in charge of his  discipline… If he had ever been caught. Being killed and reborn solved their  problems quite nicely. She watched the reviewers closely and noticed their  arrogance evaporate. Whether it was because of the case itself or because they  were only now realizing that they sat in the presence of the person who killed  him, Urd wasn't sure, but the effect of the name had been noticeable.</p><p>Ranma heard a shuffle  behind her, and turned to find the bailiff had gotten back to his feet. She  winked at him. "Want to go again?"</p><p>The man waved her off with  a grin. "No thanks, I'll wait for backup."</p><p>"Suit yourself."</p><p>"Yes. We are familiar  with that person." The first reviewer admitted slowly. "We are also  aware that you are the person who… Eliminated him."</p><p>Ranma nodded, "But  that's not the important part. How did you even find out that your fugitive had  been eliminated?"</p><p>The board sat in silence.  There was only one answer to that question. Urd and Skuld's report. In effect,  they had solved the case that would have otherwise been on the books for years,  if not centuries.</p><p>"These are the people  who not only <i>saved my life</i>, but solved your case for you." Ranma  pressed them. "You should be giving them <i>praise</i> for doing your jobs  for you. And for that, I will NOT," She took a step forward, mood  darkening with it. "Allow their punishment to proceed."</p><p>"Excuse me,  Miss?" The polite bailiff asked and Ranma turned to find him backed by  three more nicely dressed Valkyrie women waiting in the doorway, these looking  more combat ready than the bailiff himself. "It's time to arrest you  now."</p><p>With her mood sufficiently  dark and her cause sufficiently righteous, Ranma noted that they should have  brought more backup as her power levels primed. "<i>Feather Light,</i>"  she whispered, and the Angel sprang forth, bubbly smile noticeably absent. In  its place was an annoyed look as it swirled protectively around Skuld and Urd.  Her weapon to call was reflexively summoned from the ether and Phoenix Wind  settled into Ranma's hands, singing glorious battle through her soul.</p><p>Urd and Skuld stared at  the redhead in wonder. Urd's gaze snapped from the newly acquired angel to the  staff she now bore in hand. Not even she suspected that Ranma was such a  fertile ground for power and could acquire so much in so little amount of time,  but she should have. She turned to the Review Board, who sat in shock. Urd  touched Ranma's shoulder and the Goddess relaxed slightly.</p><p>"I see we've all  forgotten that a Goddess First Class Unlimited is a direct extension of our  Lord's divine will." Urd stated evenly to the board. "Her opinion  isn't to be taken lightly."</p><p>"B-But… She's only been  a Goddess for three days…!" The Third Director protested. "And  mistakenly at that!"</p><p>Urd loosed a hearty laugh,  cutting through the tension. "You think Kami-Sama doesn't know that? He  could have her busted down right here and now on His divine word alone, yet  here she is, having made her way to heaven, acquiring an Angel and Category One  weapon all by herself… And in only three days. Those facts alone should tip you  off to a very important clue." And I was silly for not seeing it sooner  myself, Urd chided herself silently.</p><p>The director was about to  say something, when the red phone on his desk rang. "Yes? Uh, yes Sir! Of  course Sir! Right away! Yes? Thank you!" He set the phone down gently.  "All charges are dropped concerning Goddess Urd and Goddess Skuld. Ranma  is free to go as well," he said to the Valkyries, who nodded in  acknowledgement. Ranma relaxed with a sigh and Feather Light twiddled with glee  around her.</p><p>"Oh, and you have an  appointment with Kami-sama tommorow."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Belldandy  watched from the bench outside as her sisters and Ranma made their way down the  Goddess Investigative Office steps with smiles on their face. She had prayed to  Kami-sama on those very steps that things would turn out ok, and by the looks-  A shadow consumed her and she looked up suddenly to find an angel with flowing  red hair look down her with a wide smile and bright eyes. Sunlight filtered  through it's speckled wings and Belldandy smiled back and asked, "Whose  angel are you?" The angel winked and fluttered off to the trio now  clearing the last of the office steps. Belldandy blinked with surprise. She  knew both Skuld's and Urd's angels, and this particular one wasn't either. That  would only leave… Ranma? As the angel circled the trio, Feather Light pulled  her attention from the conversation to the woman sitting on the bench.<p>"Bell-chan!"  Ranma exclaimed and the group converged on the sisters. Ranma's smile faded to  a sheepish look of guilt. "I'm sorry I left you behind… I just couldn't…  It's just…."</p><p>Belldandy pulled Ranma  into an unexpected hug. "Thank you for looking after my sisters, how ever  unorthodox you intervention may have been." Then she peered up at the  smiling angel. "I see you've been busy."</p><p>"Uh, yeah…"  Sheepish shame turned into a grin. "Belldandy, meet Feather Light!"</p><p>"Hahahah!" Skuld  exclaimed, "You should have seen their faces when the Board saw her first  the first time. They were SO upset!"</p><p>Belldandy listened with  amusement, then turned to Urd. "Ranma is progressing very quickly, is she  not?"</p><p>Urd sensed the underlying  point of her observation easily since she had already come to the same  conclusion. "Already got it covered. Her studies start tonight."</p><p>"Studies?" Ranma  blinked. Goddesses had to study?</p><p>"Yep, and I'm your  tutor!" Urd grinned, but it quickly faded. "What I said to the Review  Board is no exaggeration, though. I know it's a lot to take in at once, but a  Goddess First Class, Category One Unlimited is the direct extension of our  Lord's will manifest." She let those words sink into Ranma, whose carefree  attitude was all but gone. Urd could speak from a position of authority because  she had passed that very exam, but had chosen not to take the post because she  knew her heart. She knew that she could only hold the compassion required for  only her closest friends and family. Ranma, however…</p><p>"Don't worry about it  kid. For now, lets celebrate our victory!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Chapter  EIGHT</b><p><b>C</b>elebrate they did, but Ranma had an  appointment to keep earth side with a certain sister Tendo. Of course, that appointment  reminded him of the BIG appoint scheduled for tomorrow afternoon: Ranma  Saotome, meet the Supreme Ruler of the Universe. She was still trying to decide  if that was a good thing or a bad thing. Ranma popped out of the koi pound, her  ride substantially smoother now that she knew how the technique worked and  shifted to her Chinese clothing before entering the dojo. She found Nabiki  sitting in the living room watching TV with Akane.</p><p>"I thought you'd  forgotton." Nabiki said with a neutral expression.</p><p>"We just got a little  hung up is all," Ranma explained.</p><p>"In heaven."</p><p>"Uh, yeah."  Ranma scratched her head in embarrassment, realizing how absolutely  unbelievable it sounded. "But I made a promise, so here I am."</p><p>Akane looked at the two.  Was this a real conversation going on here? Ranma? Giving her word to Nabiki?  About what? She shot a questioning glare to her sister, who returned it with a  mischevious smile.</p><p>"We're going out for  a bit, A-chan." She said, leading Ranma out. "Be back in a few  hours."</p><p>Kasumi AND Nabiki? Akane  thought. Now she was sure her life was turning upside down.</p><p>Ranma recognized the part  of Nerima Nabiki was leading her into. Though she had seldom visited herself,  she knew it was the suburb's gaming district. If it could be fed money, you'd  most likely find it here, whether it be video games or gambling. Or both.  "Why are we down here again?"</p><p>Nabiki looked back at her  new protégée. "You're training of course. And here we are."</p><p>Ranma looked left to find  themselves standing in front of a building labeled "SUPER-SUPER  PACHINCO!" Ranma did an instant face plant. "You've got to be kidding  me! How is this place going to help me with my abilities!"</p><p>Nabiki tisk'd her student,  pulling her inside. In front of them stood endless stands of pachinko machines,  the steady racket of bouncing balls filtering though the establishment as  people gambled their money away. "Predicting a coin toss doesn't even come  <i>close</i> to tapping your potential, Ranma. What do you see?"</p><p>Ranma stared one of the  gamblers and her machine, steel balls bouncing wildly across a horizontal board  of pegs and lights. The redhead was about to protest again when realization hit  her with a sudden "Ooooh!"</p><p>Nabiki nodded with  satisfaction. "Exactly. Each ball is triggered to depart the chute and hit  the pegs, thereby creating numerous and unpredictable outcomes. Of course, the  speed at which the ball is sent out the chute by the player is a factor in this  equation, but it is not a decisive one," She explained to her student, who  drank it in. "I do occasionally gamble, but not in games like these. Can  you guess why?"</p><p>Ranma's mind closed around  the concept easily. "Because of the totally random element involved. Since  there is no real predictable pattern, there is no predictable way to win."</p><p>Nabiki smiled. Maybe she  had made a mistake underestimating Saotome years ago when they first met. With  the right amount of influence she could have- Nabiki cut that line of thought  off. Now isn't the time for wistful fantasies. "Exactly," she continued.  "Games like this always favor the house because of that random element and  the losers will always outweigh the winners… Which is where your lesson comes  in." Ranma followed Nabiki to the counter, who promptly held out her hand.  "2000 yen."</p><p>Ranma twitched. "I  thought you were going to train me!"</p><p>Nabiki shook her head in  mock sympathy. "Nobody ever said training was going to be free. 2000  yen." The annoyed Ranma dug money out of her pocket and slapped it into  her hand, who in turn slide it to the waiting attendant. The attendant smiled  and slid a basket of steel balls in return. The sister led Ranma back to an  empty machine and fed the balls into the hungry receptacle. The pachinko  machine happily chirped to life, flashing and beeping.</p><p>"Now, we're going to  do this one ball at a time for now," Nabiki explained to her charge.  "Your job is to predict exactly where the ball will land." Ranma  nodded her head and Nabiki thumbed the lever once, sending a ball rocketing up  the chute.</p><p>The Goddess of Luck  concentrated on the ball as it continued on the ballistic arc. The ball had  it's own aura which suddenly exploded as it hit the first peg. Chained  lightning seemed to arc from one peg to another too fast too see or understand.  In seconds, it was over and the ball was resting at the bottom of the machine.</p><p>Nabiki had been watching  Ranma closely and saw her face register shock and incomprehension. "What  did you see Ranma?"</p><p>"The… The ball had an  aura. It exploded as soon as it hit the first peg and lightening chained all  over the board," Ranma tried to rationalize what she had just seen to  Nabiki. "It was nothing like the penny toss."</p><p>The middle sister thought  on this a bit. While she really had no idea what Ranma was experiencing and  could only go by her descriptions, she had the mental process of a machine. In  another life, she could have easily been and engineer or scientist, but in this  one, she was tutor to the Goddess of Luck. "The lightening didn't start  until it hit the peg?" Ranma nodded. "I'm assuming that that aura of  lighting represented potential outcomes. Watch it again. Look for details this  time."</p><p>She thumbed the lever  again and the next ball shot out. Ranma watched closely as the same event  occurred, not quite as shocked as before. "I assume the lightening was  there?" Ranma nodded. "Now was the lightening spread across the  entire board or confined to one area?"</p><p>"Confined to an  area." Ranma confirmed. "In fact, it seemed to follow a cone to the  bottom."</p><p>Makes sense, Nabiki  thought to herself. If she is seeing outcomes, those outcomes would narrow to  one certainty as it approached the bottom. "Interesting. Now, did any of  the lightening paths seem stronger than the others?"</p><p>"Um, I think.  Maybe." Ranma answered uncertainly. Nabiki flipped the lever again and  Ranma concentrated. Sure enough some of the paths were stronger than others,  and the ball followed the paths down.</p><p>Nabiki watched Ranma's  eyes light up. She saw something. Nabiki flipped it again, and Ranma tracked  the ball down. Again. Ranma tracked it silently. Again. The ball plunked to the  bottom. Again. This time, Ranma's finger shot out and pressed against the glass  before the ball had made it half way down the maze of pegs. Sure enough, the  ball landed on target. Nabiki smiled and waited for Ranma.</p><p>"You're right.  They're outcomes," Ranma confirmed, staring at Nabiki. "The stronger  the lightening path, the higher the chance the ball will fall in that  direction.</p><p>"Very good." She  complimented. "Now for phase two." Ranma was just wondering what phase  two was when Nabiki slapped the lever five times in rapid succession, sending  the balls out of the chute at high speed. Ranma locked in on the balls as they  fell, pointing to their impact points. She was disappointed when one fell to  the side and off impact. "Four out of Five. Not bad. What happened to the  Fifth?"</p><p>"The outcome seemed  equally likely in either direction. I picked the wrong one." Ranma  admitted.</p><p>Nabiki shrugged.  "Statistically, it's bound to happen. Most events are weighted toward  certain outcomes while a few can break either way. Lets try again." The  next ten minutes saw the pair shoot their remaining supply of ammunition off  into the machine. Nabiki was impressed. Even at high rates of fire, Saotome was  averaging ninety-eight percent by the time their reserves ran dry.</p><p>The machine clicked and  Ranma looked down. Empty. "Now what?"</p><p>Nabiki folded her arms and  considered Ranma. "Well, you have two choices. We can call it a day  or," a naughty twinkled in her eye, "We can move on to phase three."</p><p>The redhead was like a  woman dying of thirst in the Sahara when it came to understanding her newfound  powers and she eagerly accepted phase three. Nabiki simply pointed over to the  desk and Ranma, for the first time in her life, eagerly spent money at Nabiki's  direction. A minute later, Ranma plopped back down beside her with the basket  of steel balls.</p><p>"Phase three,"  Nabiki began, "Involves something you mentioned earlier back at the dojo.  You said you thought you could influence outcomes, correct?"</p><p>"I'm not entirely  sure, but maybe." Ranma stated uncertainly.</p><p>"Well, that's what  we're here to find out." Nabiki thumbed the lever as before, and this  time, Ranma wasn't looking for an impact point. She was looking for something  imperceptible. She knew it was out there, just beyond her reach. With a thunk,  the ball reached the bottom. "Anything?"</p><p>Ranma shook her head.  "I could see the outcomes, but I still can't get a grasp on the influence  part."</p><p>To that, Nabiki simply  flipped the lever again. And again. And again. It took only five minutes to  deplete their current basket this time. She looked at her sister's maybe  fiancée. "Stay or go home?"</p><p>Ranma checked her packets  and pulled out 500 yen. "I got nothing left. I guess we-" Nabiki  stopped her and dug into her purse. Ranma about had a heart attack when she  gave him 5000 yen, staring at the sister in total disbelief.</p><p>She couldn't stand the  stare any longer. "Ranma, I've underestimated you, I've doubted you and  I've taken advantage of you," Nabiki explained. "But if there is one  thing I do know about you, it's that you never give up until you succeed. I've  been reevaluating everything I know about you lately, so don't let me down on  the one thing I'm certain of."</p><p>Ranma blinked, brain  function suspended in disbelief. Nabiki… Is actually betting… On me? The  redhead nodded slowly in understanding and retrieved a bucket of pachinko  balls. This time Ranma was on the lever, her total focus on the balls  richocheting wildly on the down the board while Nabiki watched. They had been  getting some hits and they were paying out a tiny supply of balls, but not  enough to make up for their losses and nothing Ranma was indicating as her own  success. Nabiki watched as one by one the pool of shiny steel depleted. While  she was by no means poor, she didn't exactly have wads of cash on her either.  Once this was gone…</p><p>Ranma was concentrating  hard now. Almost there, she thought as that special something continued to  elude her. The lightening… If she could just reach out and… the machine clicked  empty and the last ball powered out of the chute. It bounced around avoiding  all the major pockets that would score them a bonus. Now it fell deeper into  the maze and Ranma could see the major path angling away from even the minor  bonus zones. A feeling of disappointment was just creeping in when she saw it;  A tiny little branch. Nothing more than a soft glow, but it would bring the  ball back into play. If she could just reach out…<i> Reach out!</i> Time ground  down to molasses as Ranma concentrated on that single point. Everything slowed  and the ball fell, millimeters away from hitting that crucial peg. CONCENTRATE.  Ranma's entire being floated in that single space of time.</p><p><i>Tick!</i></p><p>The ball hit and its  trajectory was altered from the main line and onto the new path, but still had  a ways to go. Ranma, however, knew exactly what to look for now. She traced the  new line down, looking for the improbabilities in the path and found one that  would bring it closer to the single remaining pocket. She focused on one  fracture, time slowing for her as she did. As soon as it hit, she jumped to the  next. One more alteration and the arc became solid, feeding down into that  final pocket as if that were its destiny all along.</p><p>Nabiki had been wringing  her hands in nervous anticipation when the ball finally clicked home and the  machine sighed with a happy 'ding!' Ten more balls fed into their previously  empty container. She looked at Ranma, whose face had been practically pressed  against the glass, beads of sweat rolling down her forehead. Slowly, the  redhead looked over, and her face transformed from one of intense concentration  to a confident grin.</p><p>"<i>It's payback  time.</i>"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma and  Nabiki weren't home yet, Akane realized as the clock ticked six PM. She rocked  off her bed and stared out into the sunset sky wondering exactly how derailed  her life had become. Pressured by her parents to marry a gender shifting  martial artist, fighting for his attentions versus two other eligible fiancées,  enduring the countless numbers villains and antagonist that he attracted, dying  and being reborn by his hand and finally this- Ranma turned Goddess. Now she  wasn't even certain if she wasn't competing with her own sisters for his  attention. It was getting outright... Akane's self loathing paused for a second  as she watched a figure with a can of spray paint mark an 'X' in the corner of  the yard. What was Skuld doing…?<p>The diminutive teen  Goddess was typing away at a rather large PDA like device with wires and such  jutting out of it when she heard Akane walk up. The Goddess looked up, gave her  a smile then went back to the largish PDA.</p><p>Akane stood on the spray  painted 'X' and looked at it curiously. "Um, why are you painting-"</p><p>Skuld suddenly noticed her  immediate location and pulled her off the 'X' with a concerned look. She looked  at Akane once more and noticed the questions in her eyes at her forced change  in location. "After Mara's attack yesterday, I realized our demon problems  might follow us home sooner or later, so I'm implementing a defense for your  dojo!"</p><p>Akane blinked. A defense  for our Dojo? "What sort of defense?"</p><p>"Well," Skuld  explained, "It wasn't easy, but I took the basic template from the shrine  where we live. Since I couldn't exactly teleport the generators here, I'm  boosting them into low Earth orbit to transport them. In fact, they should be  arriving in about…" She glanced at the PDA, "Ten seconds."</p><p>Low earth orbit? Akane  wondered looking at Skuld. What, did she think this was Japanese Space Command  or something? Skuld looked into the dusk sky. Apparently she did. Akane looked  up as well and saw a tiny point of light. Kind of early for stars to be shining  and it was getting bigger. Akane looked back to Skuld. She couldn't be serious.  She began to hear a sharp whine and looked up to find a four fireballs  streaking to Earth. It was too late to scream and they hit, four giant clouds  of dust erupting within the four corners of the Tendo property. The ground  shook madly and Akane was sent to the ground as dust whirled around her. With coughing  fits, she got back to her feet and found Skuld smiling in satisfaction when the  dust finally cleared. There in front of her stood a twenty-foot tall back  square monolith imbedded in the buckled earth. The monolith itself was divided  into four sections by a deep groove that was at least a foot wide and two feet  deep.</p><p>Skuld looked at the awe  struck human. "Ready?" She didn't wait for a reply and stabbed a  button on her PDA. "Power ON!" The air trembled around the device and  it hummed contently. A glow formed within the grooves and a solid wall of  greenish light flowed forth, connecting with its sister devices from the  remaining three corners of the yard. The result was a translucent green field  that surrounded the dojo property on all four sides while extending into the  air for thousands of feet like a spotlight. Even as Akane stared in amazement,  the field faded from visible viewing.</p><p>"Is..Is it still  on?"</p><p>"Of course!"  Skuld replied confidently, "That was just the initial power flux."</p><p>Akane continued to look at  the Goddess incredulously. "But.. What IS it?"</p><p>"My very own Sub  Dimensional Demonic Interdiction Energy Barrier!" Skuld announced with  pride. "It has a total power output of 1.21 gigawatts across five planes  of existence with a switchable operating frequency…" Skuld continued to  rattle off the specs to Akane, whom she had lost after the word 'Sub  Dimensional'</p><p>"What a haul, WHAT A  HAUL!" A small bouncing figure hollered in delight, bouncing up the  sidewalk to the dojo entrance. The old Master Happosai was back after a  successful nights' raid of various women's undergarments, as evidenced by the  bloated sack slung over his back.</p><p>Skuld noted the tiny old  man, and turned to Akane. "Don't worry, it only affects demons. He should  be Ok."</p><p><i>BZZZzzzZZZAP!</i></p><p>Happosai had just cleared  the wall before running into a solid barrier of pain, light streaking off him,  frying his person and the pretty linens he carried.</p><p>Skuld looked horrified.  Akane nodded in satisfaction. "Works great."</p><p>The laughter of two  chittering girls outside the dojo stopped abruptly as they noticed one fried  old pervert smoldering at the gates. Ranma didn't know what happened to him,  but he probably deserved it. Both entered the dojo to find Akane and Skuld  standing beside a large black monolith.</p><p>Nabiki asked first.  "Do I even want to know?"</p><p>Skuld piped up happily.  "It's a Sub Dimentional-"</p><p>"Demon zapper."  Akane cut her off with the simpler explanation. Nabiki nodded. The youngest  sister's eyes narrowed on her sibling. "So, how was your night out with  Ranma?"</p><p>The answer she got wasn't  the one she was expecting. "Absolutely fabulous. In fact, if was so much  fun that's we're going out again tomorrow night." Nabiki replied with an  easy smile and Ranma nodded happily. Of course, there was the fact that she had  come out over 40,000 yen richer than when they'd started Ranma's training, but  there was also the fact that both were getting to know one another quite well  for the first time since their introduction. Nabiki was beginning to see her as  more than a cash cow while Ranma was letting down enough defenses to get to  know her as a person, something few people had even bothered doing for either  of them. And they were making tons of money in the process. The ironic fact was  that she actually had to pull Ranma away from the machines once she had that  aspect of her powers firmly in hand. While the redhead didn't necessarily care  about money for it's own sake, the fact that it was a practical application of  her ability had started her on a winning streak so obvious that the parlor  owners couldn't possibly ignore it. Nabiki had to literally pull Ranma out of  the place before they were blackballed.</p><p>Akane looked at Ranma with  surprise and confusion, still trying to wrap her mind around the fact that  Ranma and her sister were getting along well. Not just well, but incredibly  well. How could her sister possibly do this to her? She knew Nabiki to be a  mercenary, but she usually limited her acts of subversion to outsiders not-</p><p>"Yeah, tomorrow we  start on cards!" Ranma ginned from ear to ear and Akane fell over. What  did cards have to do with dating!</p><p>"Well, I've got some  studying to do." Nabiki excused herself. "Same time tommorow?"  Ranma nodded and the sister was gone.</p><p>Ranma decided that was a  good time to make her exit as well. "I promised Urd to study under her.  Gotta go Akane!" And with that, she was left alone with her thoughts.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  found Urd in the living room angrily beating on the TV. "Why won't this  stupid thing-! Oh, hi Ranma!" The redhead raised a questioning eyebrow.  "Your TV broke."<p>"Maybe Skuld can fix  it right?" Ranma didn't notice the look on Urd's face indicating that was  a very BAD idea. "Heck, she just built a demon zapper thingy  outside."</p><p>Urd looked at Ranma, then  back to the TV. "That would probably explain why the TV isn't  working." Urd turned loose a sigh. "Oh well. Get dressed, we're going  out tonight!"</p><p>Ranma looked at her  current clothing wondering what was wrong with it. "I thought we were studying?"</p><p>"What I have to teach  isn't for general consumption." She stated, then looked Ranma over.  "That, and I also need to teach you a good lesson in fashion."</p><p>Ranma looked over Urd's  sense of fashion, consisting of a high cut vinyl skirt, black leather halter  top and a petite crimson jacket with enough baubles on her person to open her  own jewelry store. Fashion Ninja, indeed, she snorted mentally. I had better  dress myself before she tries to do it for me.</p><p>Maybe it had something to  do with Ranma growing up half her life in China, Urd observed from the ensemble  the redhead had willed into existence. It was a traditional red and black  Chinese one-piece dress with a leg slit running high up the length, and over  it, a petite crimson coat to match the one Urd wore. The overall effect was one  of modest sensuality, while Urd herself normally aimed for outright sexuality.  And somehow, the matching coats brought them into convergence. Whoo-hoo! Urd  thought. What a pair we'll make tonight!</p><p>Urd began to lead the younger  goddess out and Ranma asked, "Isn't Bell-chan coming too?"</p><p>The Goddess of the Past  shook her head and smiled. "Date night. Bell and Keiichi are probably  racing down some highway even as we speak."</p><p>Even as her best friend  pulled her along, Ranma thought about Urd's statement. Belldandy? Race? Who  would have thought? Maybe she could give Kasumi a few pointers on cutting loose  every once in a while.</p><p>A half hour later the two  had found a small festival, walking around and taking in the sights. Of course,  the pair made quite a stir wherever they went, much to Urd's delight. The sexy  white and bronze goddess and her sensual redheaded counterpart could do no  wrong as they strolled through the attractions, finding that they themselves  were one. Ranma wasn't quite as at ease with all the attention as Urd was, but  she wasn't blushing outright with embarrassment either. She couldn't count the  number of times she had used her girl type to gain favor with guys, and in  reality, something deep within her thrilled at the prospect of being eye candy  now. Ranma wanted to move to squash that feeling outright, but there was her  balance and sanity to consider. It was something she had managed to maintain so  far, except under periods of stress where she still found herself sliding  complete off to one side or the other. Still, the extremes were becoming less  frequent, so she let the feelings she now had go for now.</p><p>Urd looked at her friend,  who seemed to be lost in thought at the moment. So many changes she's going  through… And so much she'll have to become. But that's what friends are for. To  help them through those times. "What is the first rule of a Martial  artist?" She asked, breaking her partner's train of thought.</p><p>Ranma cast a sidelong  glance at Urd. "Is that a trick question?"</p><p>"Not at all."  Urd stated. "In fact, it's probably the only reason you're still a Goddess  at all. Think about it. What do you bring to the table as a three day old  goddess?"</p><p>Ranma thought about it and  shrugged. "Not much to be honest. I'm a great martial artist, but I'm sure  heaven has an ample supply of those. I don't know the job, don't know the power  and don't know anything about Heaven, Hell or whatever. Heck, I barely even  know what a Goddess is." Ranma herself began to wonder why she was still a  Goddess.</p><p>"Exactly." Urd  replied. "You don't know anything about anything but you're still a  Goddess. Which means you know something. Something <i>vital</i>."</p><p>Ranma thought about it for  a moment. She only knew one thing. "A Martial Artist's first duty is to  help defend those who can't defend themselves?"</p><p>Urd nodded. "That  concept is the bedrock of your present rank; Goddess First Class, Category One  Unlimited. But it isn't limited to simply defense of the defenseless. It's to  help those in need under any circumstance, whether it be personal safety, love,  sorrow, whatever. It stretches to every aspect of human life." The goddess  watched Ranma as she absorbed the information with serious intent. "At its  core, your martial arts code is that of a servant." She held up a hand to  forestall Ranma's objection. "I'm not talking about the servant that  washes clothes and makes food. I'm talking about the service of real human  need, not fluff."</p><p>"So I'm a  servant?" Ranma asked with confusion.</p><p>"Yes," Urd  confirmed. "Even as a martial artist, you serve mankind. Your code of  servitude provides for the defense of the helpless. While that code of service  to others maybe scoffed at here on Earth, it is held in high regard up  there." Urd finished, pointing into the starry sky.</p><p>Ranma knew she was right.  The general attitude of half the people she knew was to hang somebody out to  dry and let them handle their own problems, which directly conflicted with her  code as a martial artist. If the need were genuine, she would stand, fight and  die by that code, and had already proven that more than once.</p><p>Urd watched as  understanding dawned in her friend's face. Good. "A Goddess has nearly an  identical code, and the higher the rank, the more all encompassing that code  becomes and the more vital its practice is at all times. As a Goddess First  Class, you are a servant of true need, regardless of the area it falls  under." Urd continued. "If that need falls under the defense of the  innocent, that is where you will stand. If that need falls under matters of the  heart, that is what you will mend."</p><p>"But isn't that what  you already do?" Ranma asked Urd, who simply smiled.</p><p>"Yes, but only to a  limited extent," She explained. "There is definitely some overlap  between the rank of Goddess first and Goddess second, but Bell and my ranks  focus more on want than need, plus one other significant difference." She  let the statement hang for a moment, unsure of how to explain it. "…That  difference being that the person I'm talking to at this very moment is a direct  extension of God's will manifest."</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened.  "But aren't you…?"</p><p>"We are all agents of  Kami-sama." She smiled gently, "But you are one of His hands. There's  a world of difference."</p><p>Ranma sat back in shock,  only now realizing the enormity of what she had been dropped into. Urd had said  some of this earlier, but The Hand of God? Me? I can barely lead a life free of  chaos and fiancées, let alone be 'the direct extension of God's will manifest!</p><p>"Oh, I think I'm  going to pass out..." Urd simply chuckled and Ranma stared at her.  "I'm nowhere a good enough person to take on this sort of responsibility!  Shouldn't there be a saint somewhere that needs promoting or something!"</p><p>"Maybe," Urd  started. "But you have the job and Kami-sama hasn't busted you down yet,  which means he must approve of something you're doing, and that's no small  compliment." Ranma began to protest. "No, you're selling yourself way  too short. Besides, it's not as if you come without references. How many  super-natural evils have you fought within the last five years? I haven't seen  you're complete file, but I know it's pretty dang impressive for a  mortal." She looked at Urd with skepticism. "HR already has several  different departments banging down their door to get you transferred, even Special  Duty."</p><p>"Special Duty?"</p><p>"Heaven's Special  Forces." Urd clarified. "If it needs to be infiltrated or destroyed  yesterday, Special Duty goes in on the first wave. As Special Duty, you'd be  less the hand of God and more his angry fist. Even with your martial arts  training though, I just don't see you as an angry fist, but we're getting ahead  of ourselves."</p><p>Ranma looked out over the  river they had been sitting by, focusing on the reflections of light and  on-going festivities in the water. "I'm getting tired of it anyway."  She said with a weary voice.</p><p>Urd looked at Ranma  curiously. Tired of it? "Tired of what?"</p><p>"Training. Fighting.  All of it." Urd's eyes widened slightly at the soft proclamation, and she  was sure Ranma's family would have widened even more, if not just passed out  right then in there with the news. She wouldn't have admitted it to another  living soul except possibly Kasumi, but the constant life and death struggles,  daily combat and the always having to look over her shoulder every single day was  wearing thin. Very thin. And Ranma was sure it was contributing to her  instability as of late.</p><p>"It's not that I  don't love the art," She explained slowly to Urd, "It's just that  every single day I have to watch my back for the next dagger. Always have to  learn the new technique that will keep me alive a little bit longer. And that's  all my life is; A grind from one fight to the next. That's not what my code is  about. That's not why I learn new techniques. That's not why I practice  everyday …But that's all there is."</p><p>Urd knew her sister well  enough to see the problem instantly. "And being forced to marry within the  system you are so desperately trying to survive in…" Her voice trailed off  and Ranma simply nodded, looking at the ground. Urd smiled brightly and slapped  her partner on the back, producing an 'ugh!'</p><p>"Then it looks like  we came along just in time!" She stated brightly. "Come on, let's go  get some sake and make the guys oogle!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane  watched Skuld with facination. She had originally been waiting up for Ranma and  Urd to come home, but had somehow gotten caught up trying to figure out what  Skuld was doing to their TV. The teen had gutted and rebuilt it from the ground  up, the only familiar part being left on it was the big tube itself.<p>"The problem is that  the SDDIEB field outside is blocking all outside emissions to and from the  house," Skuld explained to an awed Akane as she screwed in an ominous  looking bottle with a radiation symbol on it. "To get a TV signal, I had  to had to drop the receiver into a subspace tunnel across five planular domains  to tune the necessary harmonic frequency that would bypass the shield and  receive outside communications."</p><p>All of which translated to  Akane as Skuld having built a Demon Zapper AND a TV Killer. Amazing little  girl, this one.</p><p>"There!" Skuld  declared as she locked a final bolt into place. The girl looked at Akane,  motioning her to try the remote. The Tendo sister shook her head violently no.  Skuld sighed and flipped the TV on manually using a giant circuit breaker she  had installed on the side, right next to the nuclear fusion bottles. With a  'thunk' of the switch, the household lights noticeably dimmed and the TV came  to life. "<i>Yes!</i>" Skuld was just about to launch into a round of  bragging when both girls noticed something odd. It looked like a regular  newscast, save the anchorman wasn't speaking Japanese and had three eyes, a  squat torso and was blue. The window in back of him showed a nice sunny day …On  the planet of Altair Five. Alien language flashed across the screen as they  advertised… Shiny gelatinous cubes? Well, Akane wasn't sure, but she had seen  enough and thumbed the remote off. The TV died and the lights came back up.</p><p>"I think you have a  few adjustments to go," Akane stated. Skuld simply nodded and began to  disassemble the TV.</p><p>The front door clicked and  Ranma walked into the living room, instantly noticing the parts and tools  strewn about. She looked from Akane to Skuld to the TV monstrosity. "We  get satellite channels now?"</p><p>Skuld grinned, a huge sweatdrop  rolling down the side of her head. "In a manner of speaking… Say, where's  Urd?"</p><p>"Went back to the  Shrine to check on Bell." Skuld nodded.</p><p>Akane looked at Ranma, the  Chinese dress and jacket. She was a looker by all rights. And she had been  going out with that uninhibited one, Urd, who was no slouch for looks either.  Akane was worried. Kasumi. Nabiki. Urd. Where did she stand in all of this?</p><p>Akane put on a bright  smile. "So how was your evening, Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma smiled back.  "Had a great time!" Then she added with a conspiratorial smile,  "We made the guys oogle." Ranma hadn't even thought about it when the  words escaped her lips, but the look on Akane's face said it all. Oops. Where's  that come from? The fiancée's smile faltered, however briefly before she put it  back into place.</p><p>"That's great…"  She continued with force enthusiasm. "What else did you do?"</p><p>"Talked."</p><p>"About what?"</p><p>"Stuff."</p><p>Each reply took another  notch out of that forced smile and now Akane was getting annoyed. "What  sort of 'stuff'?"</p><p>Ranma hesitated. She could  see where this was going as plain as day. "I can't exactly say…"</p><p>Anger flashed into the  youngest Tendo's eyes, then softened to disappointment. "Is it something  you can tell her?" She motioned to Skuld. "Or Kasumi? Or even  Nabiki?" Tears began to form. "Why everybody else but me, Ranma, <i>Why?</i>"</p><p>Ranma took the seat beside  her and looked at Skuld, who need no prompting to leave the room.</p><p>"What are we to each  other anymore, Ranma?"</p><p>The redhead put her arm  around the grieving fiancée and Urd's words came to mind. '<i>…In matters of  the heart, that is what you will mend.</i>' Ranma pulled Akane close. "I  know it's hard, Akane-chan. I've been going through so many changes that it's  almost impossible for me to keep up, let alone those close to me," Akane's  heart fluttered with that last part. "And the positions we're both  expected to fulfill are shifting so rapidly they're almost no longer relevant.  I mean, we were forced into this situation by parents who expect me, a male to  take up the mantle of The Anything Goes School of Martial Arts while they  expected you to marry that person." Akane looked at her fiancé as she  sighed. "Now their heir apparent is stuck a female, has become a goddess  and might very well not be able to carry the dojo herself anyway with recent  developments."</p><p>Akane's head snapped up.  It was the first time she had heard Ranma even mention the possibility of  purposely not becoming the heir of their dojo. "W-Why not? It's been your  life… Our life."</p><p>Ranma chuckled.  "That's just it, Akane.. It hasn't been our life. It's been our parents,  and who knows what they'll do when they find out their heir is no longer one at  all, but quite the opposite and might remain that way. You know they're still  hoping for a cure like last time. Your father will have to maintain the  bloodline for his dojo somehow, and even though my father is your father's best  friend, me maintaining that bloodline though you is… Impossible." Akane  stared at her in morbid fascination. Ranma had really put thought into this…  "That would leave nobody within your bloodline except your father and  grandfather with any knowledge of the school and its art, which only leaves two  real possibilities for the school's future." Akane stared. Her it comes…  "Either train you so you can carry on and marry someone else, or train  somebody for the express purpose of marrying you or the other sisters."</p><p>Akane leaned back in  shock. Ranma was right. Oh, sure, father could wait for any one of the other  sisters to marry and raise a boy, but she doubt that outright. It wasn't as if  either father or grandfather were getting any younger, and by the time the heir  came of age… They wouldn't take the chance of all that knowledge being lost and  the school descending into obscurity.</p><p>Ranma watched as the full  meaning of their predicament fell upon her. "And this is only a fraction  of what I have to bear now. If this goddess thing comes fully to pass, I may  very well not have time to spend managing the dojo, let alone perform the  duties as an heir would. And that's even assuming you and I are ok, with eh…  um…" Akane looked like she was about ready to throw up. "Exactly.  It's not that I don't care for you… I'd have to be a fool not to for after so long…"</p><p>The Tendo finally realized  the heart of Ranma Saotome. It wasn't that she was burning her bridges by  choice, but because they were already lit and on fire around her. Ranma wasn't  leaving her behind, but the situation was such that she couldn't move back and Akane  couldn't move forward. That was unless she were willing to do… That. With  Ranma. As a girl. Akane blanched inwardly. She was use to the girl type, but  thought of it mostly as Ranma had… An inconvenience that was occasionally  useful. She had never expected to have 'relations' with it, of all things.  Heck, even Shampoo is more ready to deal with than I am, Akane thought to  herself. She'd take Ranma male or female, day or night, but Ranma still puts  her off. That sudden realization was a sobering thought in itself. The Amazon  was attractive, compliant, ready, willing and able, yet here Ranma was. With  her.</p><p>Akane reached around and  hugged the redheaded Goddess of Luck, much to her surprise. "Thank you  Ranma. No matter what happens, <i>thank you</i>."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Chapter  NINE</b><p><b>K</b>asumi entered the kitchen as was  her early morning custom to get things around for breakfast, but was greeted by  a curious sight. The rice cooker had been… Modified. She peered at it curiously  and saw numerous new gears, circuit boards and various other unidentifiable  parts attached to the bowl itself. In fact, that was the only stock part on the  device anymore. She had known about the TV, as Skuld had stayed up all night  tinkering with it, but why the rice cooker?</p><p>"I, um, wouldn't  touch that if I were you." Ranma advised the eldest Tendo sister as she  walked into the kitchen, wearing her boxers and tank top as she was  occasionally wont to do before the rest of the household woke up.</p><p>"I wasn't about  to." Kasumi noted, still staring at the modified kitchen implement. She  turned toward Ranma. "Why..?"</p><p>"Skuld got the TV  working again, but found out that the TV was causing other household appliances  not to work." The redhead explained as she pulled some juice from the  refrigerator. "So she set about modifying the affected items to where they  did work."</p><p>Kasumi looked at the alien  device from another vantage point. "Then I take it this one doesn't  work?"</p><p>"She fell asleep  before she could work the bugs out, but lets just say it teleports stuff and  leave it at that." Ranma answered and Kasumi stepped back.</p><p>"Oh my." She  gave it one last moment of consideration, then turn back to Ranma, "Did  you and Akane work things out?"</p><p>Ranma hesitated. "I  think so. May not have anything else worked out in this crazy mess, but I think  we've got that."</p><p>Kasumi smiled. "At  least you got the most important thing." Ranma nodded, returning the  smile. "By the way, I wouldn't run around in that too much anymore."  The goddess looked at her in silent question. "As a guy you could get away  with a tank top and briefs. As a girl…" Kasumi paused.</p><p>"Let's just say Urd  would approve."</p><p>And that was all that  needed to be said.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<i>Come  on, Skuld!</i> I know Pandas faster than you!" Ranma pressed the teen  goddess with her own hammer, cracking at her guard. It was the best Genma  Saotome impression she could muster and she could tell it had worked as Skuld's  frustration level grew exponentially.<p>"I stayed up all  night last night, Onee-chan!" Skuld complained as she hopped back from  Ranma's next swipe, then reengaged the older goddess. "Cut me some  slack!"</p><p>Ranma produced a feral  grin as she swung in for her next attack. " A REAL Debugger must be ready  day or night for whatever challenges await her, SLACKER!" Jeez, I'm having  fun with the ol' Pops bit, Ranma thought. Granted, I'm only using a fraction of  my ability, but she has to start somewhere.</p><p>"WHAT?" The teen  protested and suddenly her hammer strikes became more aggressive. "Are you  saying I'm not a REAL DEBUGGER?" Ranma sidestepped and the hammer blew  past her. "That's it! You're finished!"</p><p>Skuld stepped up her  attacks, fuelled by anger and Ranma secretly smiled. Now Skuld is running at a  level of potential I can work with! Sometimes all it takes is the right  motivation, the Sensei thought and assumed a purely defensive stance, allowing  Skuld to get the feel of being on the offensive. She repeatedly hammered  Ranma's staff, using her limited repertoire of attacks and stances with  precision backed by vengeance. Her feral smile now matched Ranma's own as she  ruthlessly beat the older goddess back to the edge of the dojo mat and-</p><p><i>ThwaaK!</i></p><p>The opposite end of  Ranma's weapon came out of nowhere at high speed, and Skuld's own hammer  flipped away, disarming her completely. The Goddess of Luck now held the end  tip of her hammer at her throat, its block resting behind her wrist as if the  weapon itself were a sword. Then, with a quick flip, she returned the hammer to  her side.</p><p>Skuld's heart pounded,  anger all but evaporated. So fast! And she could have done that at any time!  And I was doing so well too! She watched as Ranma's feral smile melted into a  gentler one, and sat down. When Ranma sat down, it was teaching time, so Skuld  sat as well.</p><p>"How did you feel  when you were on the attack?" Ranma asked her student, whose breathing was  finally calming.</p><p>"It was…" Skuld  searched herself for a moment. "Exhilarating. Like I was in control.  Powerful."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "The  first thing to take away from that is that the person who controls the tempo of  the engagement wins."</p><p>"But I thought I was!  …Until you disarmed me."</p><p>"Exactly." Ranma  continued. "But most battles are decided well in advance by what's up  here." She finished, tapping her head. "Tell me what you were  thinking."</p><p>"I was mad…  Pissed." Skuld shook her head.</p><p>"If you can't control  this," Ranma tapped her skull once more. "You can't control  this." She let her hand rest on the hammer beside her. "I was in  control and you were not. I won by default before your first blow landed."</p><p>Skulds eyes widened.  "Just like building something! If you can't see it here first," She  tapped her own head, "Then you'll have a much harder time building  it!"</p><p>Ranma's smile widened,  nodding at his pupil. "But building stuff takes heart too, right?"</p><p>"Oh yes,  definitely."</p><p>"Just remember that  heart can allow you to exceed your limits like you did back there," Ranma  complimented, "You didn't like the thought of being a third rate debugger,  and it drove you. But the head focuses all that energy and all that action, just  as I imagine it does when you invent stuff. Focused motivation will win you  victories believed to be impossible, got it?"</p><p>"Got it!"</p><p>"Go get breakfast  then!" Ranma stood up and she was greeted by the traditional crushing hug  before the teen ran off to breakfast. Akane stood up from her seat off to the  side.</p><p>"That was very well  done." She complimented, taking her place on the mat.</p><p>Ranma smiled modestly.  "It's easy when you're pupil is that eager." She took her place on  the mat opposite of Akane. "Ready for your lesson, A-chan?"</p><p>Akane grinned,  "Always, Ran-chan!"</p><p>It was the first match she  could remember truly enjoying since her mother passed away all those years ago.  Two simple friends. Sparring. It was pure. The way it should have been all  along.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  could only gape at the sights around her as Belldandy led her through the city  whose heart bore The Temple; the threshold of the Creator Himself. She had  known a bit of history and the redhead could see a grand mix of it in every  building she passed now that she wasn't storming heaven without a clue. It was  an absolute perfect mix of structure and nature, allowing trees to grow inside  and outside of buildings while waterfalls cascaded off the walls. Surreal  didn't even begin to describe the scene as they moved from street to street.<p>The question had come up  as to who should escort her to The One, and it was quickly decided that the  ranking sister would perform the duty. Besides, Skuld was just dying to hit an  electronics sale she had seen in the paper and had practically begged Urd to  take her. In the end, it had fallen to Belldandy to guide the nervous Ranma  Saotome up the temple steps and into the great domed hall. Ranma's labored pace  ground to a halt upon seeing the giant solid gold doors, exquisitely etched  with carvings of men, women, angels and beasts. They spanned the length and  width of the double doors, which easily towered hundreds of feet into the air.  Even a casual glance could see they told a story, and that story was more than  one could possibly take in with a glance. The doors demanded attention. Study.  And it was only Belldandy's light touch on her arm that brought Ranma back to  the here and now.</p><p>Ranma looked at the  goddess with curiosity and Belldandy smiled knowingly. "Don't worry,  you'll have plenty of time later."</p><p>They both stepped up to a  small desk in the center of the chamber, and behind it, a small girl with jet  black hair and a bright smile. "Ranma Saotome?" The goddess in  question blinked and nodded with some hesitation. Nothing like being expected,  she thought. The receptionist's smile widened. "Kami-sama will see you  now."</p><p>With that proclamation,  the double doors opened slowly with the barest of whispers, bathing the chamber  and it's occupants in the soft glow of pure, untainted light. Ranma's eyes  widened in wonder as Belldandy and the girl were forgotten. She had come a long  way and now there was only one thing remaining…</p><p>…Walk toward the light.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Even as  Ranma stepped into the purifying light, she had no way of knowing that there  were places that light would never reach. It wasn't because the light couldn't  penetrate them; it was because the light was rejected. Cast out. Evil worked in  those places to expunge its existence- its <i>taint</i> -with fire, torture  and darkness. And in the center of the dying and screaming sat it's architect.  While that person went by many names, the forces of Heaven knew her by one in  particular.<p>Hild looked down upon her  demoness with disappointment. "You have failed to bring back that which I  sought, Mara."</p><p>Mara shivered, kneeling  before her master. It wasn't so much the tone of her voice, but total lack of  emotion. Or life. It was a void that promised to consume her with displeasure.  She didn't dare look up into those eyes. "Yes, Master. I was in the process  of turning the new one when-"</p><p>"Silence."  Mara's words died with the command. "I know of the Norn's activities  concerning the new Goddess and specifically that child of mine." Hild  twisted the words at the mere mention of her daughter. "What should I do  with you, Mara? More torture?" Mara twitched visibly. She had quite enough  of that for one day once it was found out she had returned in failure. AGAIN.  "No, while that would amuse me, I have other work for you. Something you  can do to enter back into my favor."</p><p>Mara's eye's widened and  she looked up at Hild for the first time. The ruler of Hell sat atop her thrown  of skulls, flanked by muscular demon giants in red armor. The woman in front of  her looked very much like her childhood friend, but colder. Crueler. She wore a  leather halter-top and thigh high leather boots, both adorned with chains,  spikes and studs. All backlit by the fires of Hell itself. "Yes,  Hild-sama! Anything!"</p><p>The edge of Hild's mouth  turned upward in an ever-so-slight smile, breaking the frozen mask. "Bring  me Urd." The demoness' mouth dropped slightly before she managed to  reclaim it. "I don't care how you do it, but I want her here by nightfall.  She is having far too much influence on the new one as of late. My daughter needs  to be taught the meaning of… Family."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The doors  had closed and Ranma now walked through the light itself. Beyond, there was  only clouds and light. She felt something wrap around her and turned around to  find a nice old man wearing a traditional kimono, sitting in a plush chair. In  front of him was a simple wooden table and a chair opposite him. The bald old  man puffed on his pipe and proffered the seat. She knew who this was. It  resonated in her very being. There was absolutely no doubt as she sat lightly  in the chair. Kami-sama produced a smoke-ring that floated lazily into away  from the pair.<p>"I imagine you have  many questions." The old man stated with a soft smile. Ranma simply  nodded, part of her mind suspended in disbelief that she was actually talk to  God himself. "To be truthful, I can't answer them all …Or rather <i>won't,</i>"  He added with a wink. "But I imagine we can get the big ones out of the  way."</p><p>The old man-God was right.  She had tons of questions, but might as well start with the one tops on her  list. "Um, why me?"</p><p>"Why <i>not</i>  you?" Kami-sama's eyes glinted with humor.</p><p>That snapped Ranma out of  her disbelief. Was God being… <i>Funny?</i> A smile began to spread across her  own face. "You know what I mean. It was a total accident…"</p><p>God nodded. "Indeed.  Why not some Preacher, Monk or Saint?" Ranma simply nodded, leaning  forward on the edge of her chair for the answer. "First, don't believe  everything you hear." She cocked her head in curiosity and He stared at  her with a piercing gaze. "There are no accidents."</p><p>Ranma flinched. If He was  saying that there were no accidents that would mean that the Yggradsil…  Kami-sama simply shrugged. "I designed a system to run eternity so that I  can concentrate on other projects. That system- Creation itself -is  maintained by the Angels under my care and those angels have been given the  free will to exercise concerning some aspects of Creation."</p><p>"But if the computer  crashed and you're saying that there are no accidents…" The redhead was  now truly boggled, shaking her head in confusion.</p><p>"Think of it as a  system of checks and balances," The old man waved a hand nonchalantly and  took another puff of his pipe. "Creation is a dynamic thing, Miss Saotome,  and because of that fact, occasionally requires divine intervention."</p><p>"Which is why there are  Goddesses?" Ranma asked, catching onto Kami-sama's logic.</p><p>"Exactly," he  confirmed. "But their freedom of choice also means the freedom to make  mistakes."</p><p>"But how does that  fit-"</p><p>"With you?" God  supplied and Ranma nodded. "Well, somebody in HR dropped the ball when a  Goddess promotion request was supposed to be processed. It got lost somewhere  along the way and over time the Yggradsil noted Creation was short one Goddess.  After the problem went unremedied for a length of time, it initiated its own protocols  to call the system back into balance."</p><p>Ranma puzzled over this  for a moment. "But that would mean all the errors were… Intentional?"</p><p>The bald old man leaned  back in his chair and smiled once more. "Now you're getting it. By my  figuring, the Yggradsil weighed the requirements of the Goddess nessisary to  fill the position, created errors to get the right people's attention centered  on the right canidate."</p><p>Another smoke ring drifted  lazily over the Goddesses' head. "But like Urd said… Don't I need training  or something?"</p><p>God chuckled. "Urd  was right," Ranma arched an eyebrow. "You sell yourself far too  short, Miss Saotome. Not all your training takes place in a classroom. Oh sure,  you're rough around the edges, but nothing a few centuries around my daughters  won't smooth out."</p><p>Now it was Ranma's turn to  chuckle, but it quickly faded as some realities came to mind. She focused on  the coffee table.</p><p>Kami-sama's smile  diminished upon seeing her distress, sighing. "Yes, it has been a long  road, hasn't it?" Ranma looked up with a slight frown. He would know,  wouldn't He? God laid his pipe aside and stood up from the chair, walking  around the table. He placed his hand gently on her shoulder as a father would,  and warmth flowed into her body. He smiled down at her gently.</p><p>"Don't worry, we have  all the time in the world to talk about it."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Damn that  little brat, Urd thought as she wandered through the mall. As soon as they had  arrived, Skuld had made a bee-line for her electronics store, freeing the elder  sister to browse the clothing stores. Granted, she could conjure anything she  wanted into existence, but they were great for getting fashion ideas. And now  the kid was gone. Brat.<p>Urd made another pass at  the electronics store in question, walking up to the sales counter. She didn't  have to get the clerk's attention as she instantly had the attention of every  male in the store …And to think she had even dressed conservatively today, with  a nice sweater and long skirt. Her hair was worn up, white bangs flowing over her  forehead with the remainder cropped into a loose tail in the back. Of course,  the sweater really did nothing to hide her generous bust and the long skirt had  a thigh-high slit up the side, but for Urd that <i>was</i> conservative. She  mused over it a moment as she stepped up to the counter, figuring the effect  she was having on Ranma's sexuality might be working both way.</p><p>"Exuse me, have you  seen a teenager about yay high?" She asked the clerk, who promptly snapped  out of his stupor. "She would have walked out with a ton of electronics  stuff."</p><p>The sales clerk thought  about it a moment. "Um, yeah. Little black haired girl?" Urd nodded  expectantly. "Oh yeah, she left with her sister about fifteen minutes  ago."</p><p>Urd's eyes widened as a  pit developed in her stomach. "What… did her sister look like?"</p><p>"Well, about your  height, blonde hair and not quite as tan." The clerk thought about it for  a moment longer. "Yep, she led the little teen dancing right out the  store."</p><p>Urd's face contorted to  one of anger as she bolted out of the shop. It could only be one person. Mara.  The goddess cast her spirit throughout the mall, searching for a hint of  demonic taint. It was easy to find and Urd confronted it at the mall entrance. She  found Mara sitting outside on a bench, watching her expectantly.</p><p>"Where is she?"</p><p>Mara noted her voice laden  with hostility and smiled thinly. "She's safe. For now." Urd took a  step forward, her power climbing dramatically. It only caused her smile to widen.  "Now, now. Let's just say she's with… Family."</p><p>Urd's anger flashed in a  word. "<i>Hild</i>."</p><p>Mara uncrossed her legs  and stood up from the bench. "Indeed. And the condition of your sister  largely depends on her good humor at the moment." Urd's hand began to glow  with power and Mara hastily added, "And my safety, of course!"</p><p>"<i>What does she  want?</i>" The goddess hissed. It was barely a question.</p><p>"Oh, the usual  things," The demon mused, seemingly oblivious to her one time childhood  friend's anger. "A little song, a little dance. And a visit from her dear  old daughter."</p><p>"If anything happens  to her, Mara…" Urd left the statement hang unfinished while her eyes  communicated the rest.</p><p>"Ha! That all depends  on you!" She snorted as if it were indeed a humorous situation, then  conjured a plain looking door out of thin air. She opened it and a blast of hot  air escaped from the dimensional porthole. "We'll all be waiting!"  And with that, she stepped through the doorway.</p><p>Urd looked on as the  demoness disappeared. She whispered a silent prayer before stepping into the  doorway to hell after Mara.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Bwahahaha!"  Ranma rolled in her chair as Kami-sama grinned, mirth evident on His face.  "You've can't be serious! They actually ate it?"<p>God waved her off with a  wide smile on his face, "The entire Apple, if you can believe it! I mean,  I had an entire garden full of fruit, but was that good enough? <i>NOOOOooooOOO!</i>"</p><p>The redheaded goddess  continued to choke on her own fits of laughter until she finally subsided with  a bemused expression on her face. "You don't really look like that."  It was more a statement than a question.</p><p>The balding old man took  another puff from his pipe. "Of course I do… To you. And that's the only  person it matters to." Ranma smiled, but His face grew serious. "This  is something I want you to be absolutely sure about. I won't lie to you, it's a  tremendous responsibility. Not only to yourself, but the ones around you. Loved  ones. Complete strangers. Even your enemies."</p><p>Ranma's expression faded  to one of determination. She wasn't exactly sure how long they had spent  discussing her past and the matters at hand. Hours, maybe. He had explained it  and it resonated with in her, adding onto Urd's lessons from last night. She  still wasn't sure how things would work out at the dojo, and if she accepted  this post, the situation might become even hairier than it already was. Even  so…</p><p>Her train of thought was  derailed as a wave of emotion rippled through her body. Desperation. Fear. Urd.  Skuld. The golden doors, formerly invisible from the inside, opened and  Belldandy ran in panicked, formally kneeling at Kami-sama's chair.</p><p>"Forgive the  intrusion father! Urd and Skuld…!"</p><p>His face was totally  serious now as he motioned for Belldandy to rise. "Yes, I know. They have  gone to the other side against their will."</p><p>Ranma bolted out of her  chair, fearing for her new sister's safety. "The other side of what? I can  feel their fear so it can't be…"</p><p>"No, it's not. Not  good at all." Kami-sama confirmed, leaving the pipe aside. "She is in  Hell, Ranma and her Mother hopes to bend Urd to her will by holding the young  one hostage, thereby affecting you. I shall inform Special Duty. They'll be on  site in ten minutes."</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened in  shock at first, but that shock was quickly replaced by something else. There  were precious few things in this world or the next that would drive Ranma to  her limits and beyond. Few things would immediately cause her to sacrifice  herself without question. But Urd, her best friend and adopted sister…</p><p>"Now do you understand?"  God leveled his gaze upon the redhead knowingly. "That is the duty of a  Goddess First Class, Category One Unlimited. Not just your family. Not just  your friends. Everybody. Complete sacrifice without reservation."</p><p>Ranma understood what He  was saying with absolute clarity, clarity she normally held in reserve for  battle. It had been the biggest difference between Nabiki and herself, she  realized as an afterthought through their study together. Nabiki could apply  that crystal clear analysis to social situations and numbers where she herself  applied it to combat and martial arts. And now she understood what she was and  what she had to do.</p><p>"Do you understand  Ranma?" it was a gentle question.</p><p>Ranma gave him a crisp nod  and a tight smile. "I accept, Kami-sama."</p><p>"Then do what you  must."</p><p>The smile vanished and  Ranma stretched out her arm, power flowing through her very being. She knew  clearly and perhaps for the first time in three days what she had become and  the destiny she was taking into hand. She was now Ranma Saotome, Goddess of  Luck first Class, Category One unlimited by choice, fully prepared to wield  that awesome power and responsibility without reservation or question of cost.  The fact that her best friend and sisters were now being held only fired the  catalyst blazing inside her now as the order of things became imminently clear.  Her outstretched hand flared and a section of clouds began sucking down in upon  themselves as if fed into an unseen drain.</p><p>Belldandy watched as  Ranma's aura flared and the clouds began to melt into the hole she was  creating. She couldn't possibly be opening a porthole to… The hate that  emanated from it… The anguish… A porthole to Hell! In front of Kami-sama no  less!</p><p>"R-Ranma! What are  you doing?"</p><p>The old man stepped beside  the Goddess and held her arm lightly. Belldandy looked down at Him, her eyes  flashing concern. "Do not be afraid daughter, for she is My Will manifest,  and I am greatly pleased."</p><p>Belldandy's eyes widened,  her shocked expression turning back to Ranma as the goddess continued to will  the porthole to exist. With that announcement, there could be no question now.  She was His Hand and damned if her new sister would do this alone, even if an  assault on Hell wasn't exactly advisable at her current rank. "Kami-sama!  I humbly request permission to accompany Ranma in the extraction of my  Sisters!"</p><p>God smiled. Yes, these  four would be a blessing to reckoned with, both for themselves and those around  them. "Of course. Be the Light that guides My Hand, daughter."</p><p>With that, she spun around  and stepped over to Ranma, who had just finished forming the sucking maw. Ranma  looked down into the pit she had just created, seeing nothing but an angry  orange glow through the rolling smoke. Belldandy took her hand and the two came  to a mutual understanding through the silence.</p><p>Hell was just about to get  two uninvited guests.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Damn  you, Mother!" Urd snarled as both she and Mara approached Hild's throne.  Beside her was the teenage Goddess kneeling on the ground, bruised and chained  to a short stone pillar. Even through there was a trickle of blood running down  the side of her mouth, Urd knew that she had only been 'roughed up'. The real  torture was being saved for this moment.<p>"Ho, ho, ho, daughter  of mine!" Hild chortled with amusment. "You're a few thousand years  too late on that account!"</p><p>"<i>What</i>… Do you  want?" Urd's scowl deepened.</p><p>The Mistress of Hell let  her hand swing lazily as if orchestrating an unheard orchestra. Or maybe it was  the tortured screams that filtered from the pits, one could never tell. "I  just want what ever mother wants, my dear!"</p><p>Urd rolled her eyes in  disgust. "And what's that? The complete and utter domination of Life, the  Universe and Everything?"</p><p>"True, true."  Hild smiled wistfully, which rapidly took on an evil edge. "But we all  have to start somewhere." She turned to the chained Skuld and motioned to  one of her personal guards.</p><p>The red skinned, red  armored giant smiled- or at least Urd thought it smiled, it was hard to tell  through irregular snout and rows of gnarled teeth -and yanked on the chain,  bringing the girl back hard against the stone pillar. Skuld twitched, still  pulled against the strain.</p><p>"Of course, how we  start all depend on you." Hild's smile had deteriorated into a grin  totally devoid of conscious.</p><p>Urd suppressed her rage.  I'm only gonna get one shot at this, so keep her talking. "Ok, fine. Spill  it."</p><p>"That's better!"  On cue the guard released the chains tension, and a whimpering Skuld fell back  to the blood soaked earth. "My terms are quite simple. Your sister for the  redhead."</p><p>Buy time buy time buy  time, the mantra ran through Urd's head. All she needed an opening. Just a  small one. "And what would you want with a three day old know-nothing  goddess?"</p><p>"Oh but those are the  best kind!" Hild quipped, crossing a thigh high leather boot. "All  the better to mold their young, impressionable minds with, my Dearie."</p><p>Urd shook her head and  jerked a thumb back at Mara. "You gotta be kidding. She couldn't do it, so  what make you think YOU can?"</p><p>Hild's face twitched at  the reminder. "Yes, Mara didn't exactly distinguish herself in that last  operation," Mara winced as her Master's gaze fell upon her, but suddenly  brightened. "But she did get you and through you, her replacement!"</p><p>Mara fell over, stunned. Even  Urd did a double take. "<i>MY REPLACEMENT?</i>"</p><p>The Mistress of Hell let  out a labored sigh. "Of course your replacement, silly girl. One thing  that's become glaringly obvious is that this organization needs fresh blood.  The competition will do you good. Trust me."</p><p>"Trust you?"  Mara raged, momentarily forgetting who she was talking to. "I cook for  you, I clean for you, I seduce half the mortal realm for you and this is what I  get? TRUST YOU?"</p><p>This is it, Urd realized.  Mara was now in Hild's face and that won't last long before she sobers up or  Mother puts her in her place. She subtly reached around her into the small of  her back, pulling out a small phial of purple liquid from concealment. Even as  Mara began to back away from the impromptu scuffle, Urd gave the phial a fierce  shaking and tossed it into the pair.</p><p>Hild had just enough time  to notice the toss and the phial tumbling through the air. "CATCH  IT!" She demanded, but it was already too late. The glass shattered at her  feet, releasing the purple liquid, which immediately vaporized as soon as it  hit air. The resulting flash obliterated the retinas of anybody unfortunate  enough to have been staring at it, leaving Hild and her entourage clawing their  eyeballs while only the sounds of feet and the crunch of a stone pillar could  be heard. By the time the party had regained their vision thirty seconds later,  the two goddesses had vacated the top of her hill.</p><p>One of her demonic giants  stepped forward and Hild held out her hand, halting it. "No, don't kill  them. Break? Oh yes, certainly do that."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The two  goddesses ran down the hillside; though running was perhaps too generous of a  word as Urd was practically dragging the exhausted little goddess behind her.  Regardless of her state, the Goddess of the Future never complained as the two  attempted to make as much distance as possible between them and Urd's psychotic  mother. It was jagged, tortured landscape they climbed over as waves of heat  poured over them. Urd had a rough idea of where she was now; knowing that the  only way out of hell was through a gate whose normal mode of operation only  sent things down. That was a minor problem. Getting there past the roving hell  gangs, assorted guards and pits of Condemned was a major one. Oh yeah, her  mother was looking for them too. The pair climed over a final set of jagged  rocks and Urd could make out the distant gate across a plain of fire and  tortured souls.<p>A piercing howl decisively  interrupted her thoughts of escape and she whipped around to find a hellhound  on her tail. Urd didn't bother wasting her power on it because she knew it  wouldn't attack. First, she could simply turn it to ash the moment it  threatened them. Second, it didn't need to attack. It was scout and it had just  done its job admirably. She continued to drag Skuld across the plain, but she  knew they had been made. She also knew that her prayer would probably call down  a Special Duty strike force, but how much of them would be left by the time  they arrived? The hunting parties were already forming around her and there was  nowhere left to run.</p><p>One wounded teenage  goddess and one goddess second class versus fifty to a hundred or so Damned,  Urd sniffed with morbid amusement. She let her power levels ride and Skuld was  already pulling out bombs. Now if one would just oblige her by charging, they  could get this show on the road.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Belldandy  and Ranma stepped off their porthole and plunged into Hell's shaft. Belldandy  glanced at her sister as the two began their freefall through purgatory and  into the sickly orange glow of Hell below as it became brighter through the  smoke. If there was one thing Ranma could do well besides martial arts, it was  compartmentalizing emotions. She had done it with the her goddess girl-type  before learning the ways of balance, but she had far more experience with this  particular emotion: Fear. Terror. And like the Neko-ken before it, tried to  burn a hole through her psyche as they fell, blazing past layers of damned  souls and monstrosities that defied imagination. But fear was something she was  good at and she suppressed it ruthlessly, chopping it off at the source in  preparation for battle. That iron control strengthened Belldandy's own resolve  and the two plummeted through the final layer of smoke and the porthole's exit,  finally glimpsing the surface of hell itself.<p>Ranma mentally noted that  it lived up to all the movies she had seen and then some as they cut through  another layer of superheated air. The surface itself looked like a rolling  volcano, one part superheated lava pits, the other part jagged knife-edge  mountain ranges. Few details besides the major cities were discernable from  their altitude but one- A ring of ants held at bay by flashing light and  explosions. Both goddesses looked at on another and knew. Belldandy reflexively  deployed her wings and their luminescence folded in for minumum drag. Ranma  took the cue and willed her own wings into existence with the same attack  profile, both women now surreal birds of prey descending on their targets at  high speed.</p><p>Urd was nearly dry as she  pumped an underpowered lightening blast at another attacker before spinning  around to meet the next. Sure she had roasted around fifty of their number so  far, but her reserves weren't infinite. Unfortunately, her opposition  effectively was. Skuld armed her second to last bomb and chucked it into the  mob that continued to press their perimeter. A few of the bastards had slipped  through and both goddesses were worse for the wear, bloodied and battered.  Their Angels, Noble Scarlet and World of Elegance were providing fire support,  but it wasn't enough. And once they collapsed, they would be subjected to  Hild's tender mercies once again, assuming she wanted them alive. Skuld smiled  grimly and armed the final bomb. That'll be the day.</p><p>She heaved it deep and  silently counted to five. She reached three and the ground around her buckled  madly as the entire perimeter was bathed in ki and holy fire. The shockwaves  threw both goddesses to the ground as the Damned burned. Their circle was now  twice as wide as it had been, now nearly a hundred feet across if you didn't  count the flaming remains of hells foot soldiers. Urd shook away the  disorientation and stared at Skuled in disbelief.</p><p>"Dammit! Tell me next  time you resort to Tactical… Nukes?"</p><p>Her rebuked died away even  as she realized Skuld hadn't heard a word she said. Instead, her younger sister  was looking strait up with the widest smile on her face and she followed the  gaze upward, seeing the impossible: Two women floating down on angelic wings,  fully extended, vibrant with power and glory. One redhead. One blond. They two  touched down lightly beside their sisters. Belldandy smiled before turning her  attention to the Mob while Ranma remained all business.</p><p>Ranma had seen the pair.  They were beaten, bloodied and exhausted. But they had held, and it had plunged  Ranma's silent fury to a temperature of absolute zero. Power flared and Ranma's  Angel came forth while Belldandy brought hers out in a whirlwind. Both angels  reflected the hearts of their owners, which seethed vengeance. Phoenix Wind  materialized in Ranma's hand and it howled for justice while Belldandy called  her polearm Arc Light into being.</p><p>Urd sneered vengefully at  the sight. Oh yeah, screw with the Norns will ya? Now it's time to pay the  Piper, bitches. As if sensing her thoughts, Ranma turned back to her with the  same vengeful smile on her face. Urd could see the difference. She was The Hand  of God. Officially Anointed. And she was upset. VERY upset. Infact, after the Angry  Hand of God got done with them, the Angry Fist of God should be arriving in…</p><p>"Special Duty will be  arriving in about five minutes, sister." Belldandy stated, now all  business herself. "We will hold this position as long as necessary."</p><p>Ranma took a step toward  the mob, which was growing restless. Stunned by the instant annihilation they  may have been, but that effect wouldn't last forever. "I'll take the  perimeter. Belldandy, blast anything that gets though." Those weren't the  orders of a three day old Goddess. Belldandy noted. They were the orders of a  battle commander; A Goddess first class category one unlimited, and she nodded  sharply. For herself, Ranma could feel the power rising to indescribable  heights. Now that she accepted everything that she was and would be, she was a  direct conduit for the Almighty's power. She twirled Phoenix Wind with  anticipation. She would still be at an experience deficit, Ranma noted  silently, but was learning something new every minute and she was going to make  the enemy pay for their error in cash.</p><p>It begins… <i>Now.</i></p><p>Skuld watched Ranma as she  stepped forward with that insanely powerful staff of hers. If Ranma was going  to hold the peri- All three Goddess were startled as a rush of air blasted  around them and Ranma was suddenly in two places at once. The after image  quickly faded and Ranma was now in the mob pulverizing the bodies of Damned and  Demon alike as the staff spun nonstop. The flank of the mob pressed forward and  Ranma was there too, cutting down target after target. It was stunning to watch  because while Ranma wasn't necessarily in every place at once, she was now  moving so fast as to appear to be.</p><p>Ranma fed the speed higher  and everything moved in slow motion. Her opponents, their attacks, everything.  It was pathetically slow and she tore into the mob with Phoenix Wind, blazing a  trail of glowing power and super natural light. She shifted to the flank,  leaving an after-image in her wake and the new mob crumbled. Belldandy cut  loose a few ki-blasts and at light speed, found their targets instantly and  vaporized whatever happened to cross Ranma's invisible line. Feather Light was  having a heyday too as her fire elemental power flamed rank upon rank of the  encroaching Damned. Ranma spared a glance back and Belldandy had gone hand to  hand as well as a minor demon evaded her ki blast and jumped in. The polearm  was up and it looked like a solid deflection for Bell-chan's Arclight. Ranma  spared another quarter second and concentrated on the deflection. The demonic  sword would rebound, but if she concentrated…</p><p><i>KlaaaaNG!</i></p><p>Ranma's improbability  snapped into place and the blade deflected at such an awkward angle as to leave  the demon totally unguarded for Belldandy's retaliation. The wayward demon went  down in a spray of black ichor and she returned to her ki attacks once more  while Ranma resumed her relentless defense of the perimeter. She wasn't tired.  Wasn't sore. She was just power and they would all fall beneath her.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Mara had  risen above the mob to get a better view. It was worse than she had possibly  imagined. The little goddess was almost invisibly fast and holding back a wall  of demons that was pressing from every angle, while that wretched Belldandy  handily picked off targets of opportunity. Annoying as that was, it wasn't a  real problem because sooner of later she would run out of juice like her  sisters. No, the redhead was now the primary threat because she wasn't just a  One-one in name anymore. That, and she had seen her determination firsthand.  She would hold that wall back all day if necessary, with or without help, and  had the power to do it.<p>But it wasn't hopeless by  any means because the little goddess was still handicapped by the same tactical  truth as before. "Ah, too many targets and not enough time…" She hummed  and powered up a lighting blast. The smallest Goddess will do nicely. The  demoness outstretched her hand, taking aim…</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b><i>KRChABOOOoooM!</i></b><p>Ranma swung around at the  sound and watched as a wayward demon plummeted to the ground in a sheet of  fire, five winged figures cutting though her smoking plum before angling in on  their position. The first pass was made at high speed, and the Valkyries opened  up the perimeter with a combination of ordinance and ki blasts. Ranma leapt  away as her immediate targets erupted in holy fire. The Valkyries swung around  for another pass, annihilating any Damned that didn't have common sense to  retreat to a more sensible distance.</p><p>The lithe, blue haired  strike leader touched down first and the remaining four followed suit, wings folding  in behind them. Heath's gray eyes picked out the leader easily and stepped up  to her in a crisp manner, inclining her head with an informal bow. There had  always been a sibling rival between the Hand and the Fist; the Hand thinking  those of the Fist relied too much on brute force to solve their problems while  the Fist generally thought of the Hand as meddlers too good to get their nails  dirty. She sized up the short redhead in command, and realized instantly there  would be no such rivalry here. She may be the Hand, but she obviously wasn't  afraid to play hard.</p><p>"Heath, Goddess First  Class Special Duty, M'amn. We're here to extract your team."</p><p>The redhead simply nodded.  "Thank you, Heath. If your group doesn't mind kicking some demonic ass,  I'll get us out the same way we came in."</p><p>She watched an edge of  steel flash through the Redhead's blue eyes. Oh, I'm liking this one already,  Heath thought with glee. "Kicking demonic ass is what we do best,  M'amn." She turned sharply to her squad, strait blue locks whipping  around. "You heard her! Time to earn the wings on your backs, ladies! Fire  teams, by the numbers!. TAKE ME OUT!"</p><p>Each Special Duty member  took up a field of fire and deployed their angels around the group,  simultaneously unleashing measured, lethal bursts of ki while their angels  supported with elemental attacks. Ranma noted the coordination of the team and  it was obvious nothing was going to get through their kill zone to threaten her  sisters. Without a second thought, she stretched out her arm once more and  began to feed the porthole, a glowing shaft of light rising around them that  would pierce the smoldering roof of Hell...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>…If given  enough time, Hild thought irritably, time she wasn't about to give them. If she  couldn't have the redhead, there was no real point in keeping anybody alive,  was there? She turned to the red demon guard on her right. "Remember how I  told you you could hurt them?" The demon nodded, the curves of its  imposing horns cutting thought the hot air. "Hurt them <i>bad</i>."<p>"Blood and  Glory!" the demon rumbled as it stepped to the mountain's edge. Yes, time  to annihilate them all. Time to prove that I am worthy to rise to the highest  ranks! The Demon collected his rage and it flared to life within its taloned  palm. The rage built and the angry blood red glob of energy grew larger until  both hands were required to contain its forces. Power began to feed back, but  still the demon pushed it outward, creating an unstable ki ball the size of a large  boulder. Sensing that he was nearing his limit, the red skinned demon heaved  the destructive force away with precision, collapsing to his knees as his fury  sped downrange.</p><p>Ranma's first warning was  "Oh shit." as Urd observed the charge and release of the ki energy.  Ranma continued to form the gate but turned, only to find one of the biggest  ki-blasts she had ever seen streak down on them. Ranma had unleashed something  close to that size exactly once, and knew full well the destructive firepower  contained there in. All combat ceased as opponents from both sides stopped to  watch the blazing red sun burn toward them.</p><p>Heath was about to order  the unit to scatter when she saw Ranma's other arm stretch toward the incoming  ball, a secondary aura engulfing the woman. She ran down the list of options  available. The flight time was too short and any tactics she had for stopping  something that big in a group like this would take too long. There was just too  much liability for an effective defense. With that, Heath walked up close to  Goddess for a front row seat. This was gonna be good.</p><p>The initial terror washed  over Ranma like a tidal wave, but she quickly shut it down and began to  concentrate. It was a damn ki-blast and she was the Goddess of Luck. What were  the options? In the space of a split second she ruled out a retaliatory strike  with a blast of her own or throwing up a defensive shield. The former wouldn't  guarantee the blasts' elimination and might even magnify it while the latter  she just didn't know how to implement. She probably could. Maybe. Reliably? Too  many ifs. Ok, what do I know about ki-blasts, Ranma wondered rhetorically. A  lot. They required intense concentration and are inherently unstable. It was  trouble enough to form the containment matrix properly, let alone making it  last long enough to hit the target without bleeding energy all over the place.  And if you didn't charge it right, the power had the potential to feed back  and- Wait. Potential? Potential means probabilities. Probabilies and odds.</p><p>And <i>luck.</i></p><p>All of that had flashed  through Ranma's mind in under a second, and she raised her other arm toward the  incoming blast. She focused. Could see the ki was balanced. The matrix was  perfect. It was almost one hundred percent likely to reach ground zero intact.  Fortunately for them, she lived in that small zone between almost and certainty  these days. She focused harder and was caught between time. After hours of  pachinko with Nabiki, the sensation no longer held any surprise and she  dissected the ball, looking for that tiny strand of improbability. And found  it. A slight sheer in the balance. A ripple, nothing more. If the ball had to  continue for fifty more miles, that ripple might amount to something. But at  the short range they were talking about now, it wasn't even a factor. Well, not  unless Ranma caused the ripple to reflect like that. And rebound like so.  And-</p><p>CRACK<b>BOOOOooooOOOOOmMM!</b></p><p>Ranma was rocked from her  trance as the ki-blast spontaneously detonated nearly half a mile out, washing  the area with smoldering debris. The worst they received was a few ash burns  but nothing serious. The western flank of their enemy however, hadn't gotten  off so fortunate. While the initial lines of the Damned were still intact, a  huge chunk had been blown out of their depth, and all that remained of their  reserve was a burning molten crater caused by the massive air-burst. And  bodies. Lots and lots of bodies. It took the Goddess a moment to recover from  the devastation she had just unleashed before completing the porthole. Ranma  took one final look at the crater, and in a flash of light, Hell belonged  solely to the damned once more.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Epilogue</b><p><b>"I</b>t's here, Onee-chan!" Skuld  bounded into the Dojo where Ranma and Akane had been sparring. The two broke  off and Ranma eyed the sister curiously.</p><p>"What's here,  exactly?"</p><p>Skuld looked annoyed.  "Don't you ever check your email?"</p><p>Ranma winced. Since  officially accepting the position of Goddess of Luck full time last week, the  teaching had begun in earnest, and that included Skuld's insistence in getting  Ranma up to speed on all things tech. Granted the language of Divinity was  getting easier to read, but it still wasn't second nature to her yet.  "Come on, cut me some slack." She pleaded.</p><p>"Hmmf." Skuld  sniffed. "Only this once and ONLY because it's such good news!" Both  Akane and Ranma waited expectantly as Skuld felt it necessary to draw out the  dramatic moment. "It's your first assignment!"</p><p>"My first…"  Ranma's jaw dropped. She had knew one was coming but so soon?</p><p>She had been keeping Akane  abreast of all the details so they could form contingency plans around their  family, and now she asked, "What assignment is it?"</p><p>"The Goddess Support  Hotline, effective next month!" Skuld beamed pride that her sister would  get such a mainstream posting so quickly.</p><p>Ranma mouthed the words.  It didn't sound too bad and Skuld seemed dang excited about it. She shrugged.  Sure why not? The redhead turned to Akane. "Well, that about clinches it.  What contingency do you think we should dust off?"</p><p>Akane thought on the  matter a moment. "Win, lose or Draw."</p><p>"Sounds good to me,  A-chan." Ranma smiled, and the trio cut practice early. There were lots of  plans to be made, after all.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The next  evening, the entire family had gathered in the Dojo, as it was the only room on  the property that would accommodate, well, everybody. Ranma mentally chuckled  at the thought. Everybody and anybody that had been in some way shape or form  involved in turning my life upside down over the past five years either by  accident or design. That included, for the most part, all his fiancées, the  jealous suitors, his family, potential in-laws and assorted friends. Heck,  they'd even been able to round up Ryoga before he disappeared off into the  wilderness again. His sisters Bell, Urd and Skuld were there too, along with  Keiichi. She also had no doubt in her mind that the main reason Urd was present  was not just solely out of friendship, but to watch the chaos and carnage that  was about to ensue. Of course, the evil grin on her face said all that too.<p>After everybody had  gathered, Ranma and Akane stepped up to the group, and there was a certain  amount of expectation in the air. Was this it? The wedding announcement? The  big break up? Who was 'The One Fiancee'? Needless to say, Nabiki was all over  the betting action, collecting money from friends and acquaintances at every  turn.</p><p>Ranma cleared his throat,  and the idle chatter went silent. Akane stepped forward. "Thank you all  for coming. Of course, you already know we have an important announcement to  make…" Their audience hung on every word. "I'm sorry to inform you  that Ranma and I will not continue our engagement." The effect was  immediately apparent. Half their audience- namely the parents -eyes buldged and  began gasping for breath. Nodoka teetered on the edge of consciousness while  Genma and Saotome simply stuttered, completely dumbfounded. Others, however  practically quivered with delight. Shampoo and Ukyo simultaneously lept up  yelling "<b>YES!</b>", glared at one another and sat back down. Ryoga  simply let out a sigh of relief. At long last, justice had been served. Kuno,  of course was still furiously trying to decide whether to love or hate the  woman he had just recently found out was indeed Ranma Saotome. Both Ranma and  Akane were pleased with the reactions so far. Heck, it was going better than  their betrothal night did, which ended up in shambles. They had both agreed  that the bad new should come from Akane, since they had long since learned that  anything so volatile from Ranma's mouth would surely destroy the Dojo.</p><p>Soun came to his senses  first. "But why, Akane! You're both so fond of one another!"</p><p>Genma wisely said nothing  while his wife reeled with the shock, her vision of a manly man now being  placed in further jeopardy.</p><p>For this, Akane stepped  back and now Ranma took the stage. Akane was the icebreaker, but she would  drive the point home herself. If all went well, the property damage shouldn't  be… <i>Too </i>substantial.</p><p>"You're right, Mr.  Tendo, we are both fond of one another." Ranma answered softly in place of  his ex-fiancée. "However, complications have arisen in our relationship  that make it impossible to go forward." Again the crowd sat in rapture.  "The form I'm in is, to our knowledge irreversible for the foreseeable  future." Genma began to speak up, but Ranma cut him off quickly.  "We've already looked into a cure," Ranma now motioned to her three  sisters off to the side of the room. "You all know their credentials by  now." Of course they did. Nobody in the room was about to challenge the  word of a Goddess. There were two people that would require special attention,  however.</p><p>Ranma now knelt down to  his Mother, who was now beginning to comprehend the ramifications of his  statement. She took her hands gently. "I'm sorry I can't be your Man Among  Men, Mother." and looked down in shame. Nodoka sniffed, but pulled her  daughter's chin up. "It's… It's Ok. It will just take some getting used  to, that's all." A smile began to creep across her face. "Of course,  if you're going to be a woman, you can't get much better than a Goddess…"  The smile gained intensity and Nodoka sat up straighter. "In fact, you  might just be a Woman Among Women. I think you and I are going to have a little  talk after this!"</p><p>Ranma pulled away from his  beaming mother. Ok, that just got too weird. There was one more person, though.  Probably the sanest one of them all. Ranma walked over to Ukyo, who was visibly  shaken with the news. Ranma pulled her up and she did little to resist.</p><p>"Ranma… I can't…  I…" She stammered, refusing to make eye contact herself. And like her  mother, Ranma pulled her chin up so that they looked one another in the eyes.</p><p>"I know you  can't." Ranma returned softly. "But I want you to know one thing  above all else, Uu-chan…" Her nickname grabbed the Okanomiyaki girl's  attention. "You will <i>always</i> be my best friend." Ranma pulled  her into a hug and the two simply embraced as Ukyo sniffled. Even Ranma herself  wasn't immune to the trickle of tears.</p><p>"Thank you Ran-chan…  We always will be." Her smile brightened through the tears and she sat  back down while Ranma returned to his place by Akane.</p><p>Ranma looked at the crowd  and its total silence. Even Skuld's best estimates for damage control hadn't  been this optimistic. Every model she came up with predicted at least one hole  in the dojo wall at the ten-minute mark. Well, no reason to let her down now,  she smiled inwardly.</p><p>"Some of you are  undoubtedly wondering what this means for the Dojo." Genma and Soun came  alive once more, their attention focused on the boy… Girl…Whatever. "Akane  and I have given it a lot of thought over the last week and as we see it you  only have two choices. First, you either wait for Akane to marry and have a  male child, thereby continuing the bloodline…" She let the implications of  that sink in before continuing, "Or you let me teach the art to Akane so  she can carry on as the legitimate heiress to the Anything Goes School of  Martial Arts <i>and</i> so that she may teach her <i>son</i> when he comes of  age." Both Akane and herself had agreed early on that this was no longer  their father's game and that they would no longer be pawns in it. The parents  could wiggle and they could squirm, but there was only really one choice.</p><p>Both parents blinked.  Akane? Heir of the Dojo? Genma spoke up first. "This is highly irregular,  boy…" Soun nodded in agreement. "Yes, quite irregular!"</p><p>Akane sighed. It was time  to break out the big guns. She stepped forward once more in a sweet voice,  "Oh, you mean as irregular as having a lesbian relationship with a goddess  and adopting a child so it can be the heir of your dojo and not your own  blood?"</p><p>Both parents jaws dropped  to the floor, faces red with embracement while Ranma and her sisters off to the  side tried SO desperately not to giggle. It took nearly five minutes for both  Soun and Genma to regain their composure.</p><p>"Um, when you put it  that way…" Genma began nervously.</p><p>"Maybe it's not so  bad…" Soun flushed. "Well, I suppose it would allow you to continue  to stay in our residence, Saotome-kun."</p><p>Ranma began to smile for  the first time since the meeting began. Break-up plus twenty minutes and still  no property damage. Positively unbelievable. But still, there was something she  was forgetting.</p><p>"<i>Hiya!</i>" A  high-pitched squeal erupted from the middle of the crowd and a bubbly  purple-haired Amazon bounced forward. "No more fiancées to claim Ranma!  Shampoo now have Airen all to self!"</p><p>With that proclamation,  Shampoo, glomped onto Ranma's arm, showing no hesitation in pressing her body  into the redhead. Oh yeah, Ranma noted dryly. That's what I forgot.</p><p>"Oh, I wouldn't be  too sure of that." Ranma, Shampoo and the rest wheeled around to Nabiki,  who had just walked up to the pair.</p><p>Ranma's eyebrow arched in  curiosity and the Amzaon's gaze narrowed on the Tendo sister. "You know  new fiancée rival?" Nabiki simply nodded with that smile that would tell  you absolutely nothing. "Mercenary girl tell who rival for Shampoo."</p><p>Nabiki simply held out her  hand. "Five thousand yen."</p><p>"Mercenary girl  expensive," Shampoo grumbled, digging though her pockets. Damn expensive,  but this was need to know information. Finally she slapped several bills into  the waiting palm. "Now tell Shampoo rival name." Nabiki chuckled as  she pocketed the money.</p><p>"Me." She said  simply and leaned into Ranma with her body, planting a light kiss on the  goddess's lips. Half the room face planted into the floor right there on the  spot while the other half simply froze in disbelief. Ranma was definitely among  the latter, a small trickle of blood running from her nose.</p><p>"<i>Go Ran-chan!</i>"  Urd cheered from the sidelines. "That's my sister!"</p><p>"Meh- meh- <i>Mercenary  girl like girl type!</i>" Shampoo squeaked, approaching hyperventilation.</p><p>"Well, I do seem to  recall mentioning how cute she was when we first met. And Ranma does meet a lot  of prerequisites." Nabiki held up fingers and began ticking them off.  "Attractive. Intelligent. Strong. Skilled. And of course, the ability to  make substantial quantities of money …Let's just say it's an aquired taste."  She finished with a sly look. Ranma was definitely pink now.</p><p>Shampoo stood speechless.  She released her glomp on her intended and stared Nabiki down. "Shampoo  challenge Mercenary girl to duel! Shampoo even let choose weapons!"</p><p>That snapped Ranma out of  her state of shock. Nabiki would stand absolutely no cha-</p><p>"Blackmail."</p><p>"What?" Both  Amazon and Goddess did a double take.</p><p>"You said I get to  choose weapons." Nabiki stated with an icy smile. "My weapon is  blackmail."</p><p>Shampoo paled a bit,  stepping back. "Evil Mercenary girl wouldn't."</p><p>"I wonder what I  would find if I dug into the Neko Han Ten's tax filing history…" The  middle sister mused, then with hard glare, "Trust me <i>Kitten girl</i>,  it's in your best interest to keep this non-violent."</p><p>"HMmf!" Shampoo  snorted and retreated toward the dojo doorway. "This only just begin, Evil  Mercenary Girl!"</p><p>Nabiki also turned to  Ranma, taking her leave as well. "Later, Ran-chan. Don't forget about  tommorow tonight's…<i>Practice.</i>" A stunned portion of Ranma's brain  noted that she'd be hard pressed to put much more innuendo into a single word  than Nabiki just had.</p><p>On reflex, Ranma turned to  Akane who had simply been starring at them for the entire exchange in utter  disbelief. Her sister. The Ice Queen. And Ranma. As a girl. "<i>Baka  hentai…</i>" She breathed incredulously.</p><p>The three goddesses who  had remained on the sidelines joined the pair, Skuld being the first to speak  as she punched data into her oversized PDA. "Uh, sorry Onee-chan… I  couldn't even begin to model that scenario."</p><p>"God, you and me  both." Ranma shook her head. Urd watched her with an expectant glint in  her eye and subtle smile. Whatever. It was time to close the deal, Ranma  thought. She walked over to the parents, who were still trying to rationalize  the last five minutes in their minds. "So what's it going to be?" I  stay and teach or you wait for the next son?"</p><p>There was no choice  really, just as Akane and Ranma had planned it all along.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Later that  evening, Urd joined her best friend on the roof, handing her a glass of sake  while staring at the stars. The silence lasted all of about five minutes.<p>"Well?"</p><p>Ranma glanced at the  Goddess, her sister. "Well what?"</p><p>"You know." Urd  stated with a trace of humor.</p><p>"I don't have a clue  what you're talking about." Ranma protest, face turning light pink.</p><p>"Oh, I think you  do." Urd's smile grew.</p><p>"Look, I really don't  know what-"</p><p>Urd's eyes glittered with  mischief. "How was it?"</p><p>Ranma's face was a bright  pink now. "Um, it was… uh…"</p><p>Urd grinned widely as her  sister squirmed. "Did she French?"</p><p>"I <i>so</i> hate  you."</p><p><b><i>End.</i></b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Series  final notes:</b><p><b><i>W</i></b><i>hew! Thanks for sticking with it to  the end! Well, not exactly the end. The end of this particular story arc, at  least. If this series is well enough received, I'll continue on to the next  planned arc, throwing in a Tenchi Muyo crossover into the mix as Ranma, Goddess  of Luck, endures her first days on the job as a Goddess Relief Hotline  Operator, not to mention developing the Shampoo vs Nabiki fiancée rivalry,  Akane's continued training as heiress to the Anything Goes School of Martial  Arts, Ranma's own development as well as all the other fun stuff you've come to  expect by thoroughly screwing up the series as much as I'm planning to.</i></p><p><b>About Angels;</b><br/><i>I took the liberty of giving them more independent flight than what they're  usually credited with in the Oh My Goddess! series. I normally see them  constantly tethered to their masters via that squiggly whirlwind and I can't  recall an instance where they just go off on their own as Ranma does with  Feather Light (best name I could think of), so I cut that tether for one  chapter to help the plot along. There is also how Ranma obtained her angel.

I'm hoping to get a chance to  explain that in detail with the next series, but suffice to say she's been  doing some soul searching. That, and with Nabiki, I don't see such a  relationship entirely out of the realm of possibility simply because she's a  'means to an end' type person-If it fits into her plans and goals, she's an  equal opportunity employer. I figure this personality trait</i> could easily  encompass her business and personal life.</p><p><b>Nabiki vs Shampoo</b>;<br/>I<i>f I do get a crack at the next series, this is going to be a fun one to  develop.

Granted,  it's been done, but everything I know about the Ranma ½ series (and I've owned  all thirty eight books in their original Japanese) says that it's not likely  that either woman would ever full accept a girl-type locked Ranma. Of course,  that excuse only works if you're not twisting the series into a pretzels like  I'm already doing, so ignore my witless prattle.</i></p><p><b>About Belldandy;</b><br/><i>With a polearm! Ok, so that was stretching it a little bit, but they were in  hell. I didn't like the idea of her going in unarmed.</i></p><p><b>About Ranma;</b><br/><i>I'm not gonna make any apologize about this one. He is a she and not likely  to become a he just because I'm having so much fun. So there :p If I do get to  continue the series, she'll definitely be saddled with the trials of dealing  with her own sexuality, including her body's hardwired attraction to guys and  her male psyche's attraction to women. Not mention sister Urd's meddling :)</i></p><p><b>About Akane;</b><br/><i>With no further cause for conflict, and Ranma assuming the status of 'good  friend', there's no reason why she couldn't be the dojo heiress. She has proven  martial arts determination, even if that determination was always hamstrung by  a total lack of self-control. With instruction from a good friend she doesn't  see as a threat, I can see that potential finally beginning to bloom.  Precedents were set for this in the very first episode in which Akane loses to  Ranma as a girl without knowing about the curse. She can take defeat and  instruction, but only from the right source.</i></p><p><b>Special Thanks to:</b></p><p><b>SilverBreeze and his  Dragon/Multiverse Ranma Fanfics</b>.<i> If you can get past the grammar and god-fic style, a  lot of his stories have some excellent alternate fiancée development that  helped inspire parts of this story.</i></p><p><b>Simon Bre and The  Accidental Goddess</b>.  This is an excellent work that inspired me to no end. It's witty, funny and  well worth your time to read. Hey, how can you not love Ranma Saotome, Goddess  of Sex first class? Really, it's not nearly as lemony as it sounds.</p><p><b>The Ranma ½ FAQ </b>for helping me remember some of the  facts I had forgotten, including names, places and special techniques.</p><p>That's about it. Until  next time…<i> No Need for Goddesses!</i></p>
