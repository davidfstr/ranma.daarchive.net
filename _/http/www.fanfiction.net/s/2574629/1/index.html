</div><p><b>Oh My Ranma ½!<br/>The Temporary Goddess </b><br/>Stared: 15Jul05<br/>By Ozzallos</p><p><b>Chapter ONE</b></p><p><b>I</b>t was late, and Skuld was bored.  Not just bored, excruciatingly bored. It was one thing to stalk the bowls of  the Yggradsil, sending errant systems bugs to their certain doom with the  gratifying thud of her hammer. It was, however, quite another to defrag a  portion of Creations largest super computer, whose storage capacity stretched  into, well, eternity. The diminutive teenage girl yawned sleepily. Sure, she  realized that reality had to be kept running smoothly and long access times  were not exactly desirable toward that function, but what she really needed  right now was ...An ice cream Sunday. Yeaaaah... With hot fudge. AND cherries!  Skuld's daydream was just taking shape when-</p><p>"Surface Intercept.  Anomaly detected."</p><p>The dark-haired goddess  whipped around at the announcement, studying the transparent display in front  of her. Few things would have separated Skuld from her ice cream daydream, but  any anomaly in the Yggradsil couldn't be taken lightly and she was, after all,  a debugger. She typed a few keys on the on the floating keyboard. Mortal realm,  Skuld noted as the data poured out in divinities script.</p><p>Skuld's eyebrow furrowed  as she leaned forward in the stylish floating chair. "Trace anomaly."</p><p>"Co ordinance  301187.666499/A661.00 Locale, Jusendo, China," her terminal complied.</p><p>China, again! Skuld  gripped her hammer tightly. She loved debugging as much as the next goddess-  well, probably MORE than the next goddess -but she was getting tired of  stomping bugs in THAT part of the Yggradsil! I might have to petition for a  serious upgrade to that section sooner or later, Skuld thought. Probably nothing  a bit more RAM wouldn't fix.</p><p>"Any details?"</p><p>The terminal thought for a  moment, isolating the source of her annoyance. "Abnormal power spikes  recorded, physical location junction 51866311-2301b, memory access point  100056111g000 x 00199991111000."</p><p>Skuld hefted her Hammer  with renewed enthusiasm. It was bug stomping time! "Reroute function and  isolate the access point from the rest of the system!" Bring em on!</p><p>"Complying."  Even as the as the young goddess turned toward the door, the entire room was  bathed in a deadly red glow. Skuld froze.</p><p>"WARNING! Reality  point 301187.666499 /A661.00 unstable! Critical failures detected at junctions  -2301c, d,e,f,g...," She listened to the growing litany of critical  failures with ever widening eyes "...Data corruption detected at memory  access points..."</p><p>Skuld burst out into the  hallway with only one thing on her mind. "BELLLDAAAANNNDYYYYY!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Power.<p>Chaos.</p><p>Jusendo, China.</p><p>Two combatants raged in  the maelstrom of supercharged Ki and energy, locked in an epic battle that  would determine life and death. One of those combatants was a god, with a  destiny to rule an entire civilization. The other was mortal, whose first duty  as a martial artist was to protect those incapable protecting themselves.  Today, one of them was going to die. Every element came to witness this battle  as the fighters danced within a lethal typhoon. Earth crumbled. Fire raged.  Wind ripped and water boiled. And unbeknownst to either, reality began to  buckle under the weight of their battle. But both fighters were too broken,  bloodied and spent to even notice anything beyond their dance of death,  focusing on the final blow.</p><p>It came.</p><p>The god died.</p><p>And from the calming  tempest and rain emerged arguably one of the greatest martial artists the world  would ever know; one of his hopes literally eraining down around him while the  other was cradled in his arms, alive against all odds.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Skuld  swung at another bug, mashing its squat multilegged frame beneath her debugging  implement of choice. She had even managed to enlist the help of her sisters,  which was a mixed blessing. While neither quite approached her skill in  debugging, junction 51866311-2301b was what you would call a target rich  environment at the moment. In other words, they couldn't possibly miss.<p>"You really screwed  it up this time, didncha, squirt!" A lithe, white haired woman complained  as she frantically blasted another half dozen bugs from existance.</p><p>"I told you this  wasn't my fault, Urd!" Skuld complained. "And be careful where you  aim!"</p><p>Belldandy touched another  with her staff, causing the wayward bug to poof in a mildly explosive manner.  She winced as the bugs reminded her too much of Earth's furry little rabbits.  Mutated, six legged rabbits beat with an ugly stick, but such attributes didn't  make the task any easier. "Of course it wasn't your fault. Urd, be  nice!"</p><p>Urd was just about to  retort when the computer cut in, "Power returning to nominal levels."</p><p>Skuld was stopped  mid-swing. She really didn't want to even ask the next question. "System  integrity report?"</p><p>Again, the Yggradsil  churned for a moment. "Extensive file corruption detected in memory access  point 100056111g000 x 00199991111000. Invalid partition size. Invalid files.  Suggest running Divinity Disk Doctor for emergency data recovery."</p><p>The youngest goddess weary  sighed. She was <i>really </i>beginning to hate this section of the Yggradsil.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  Saotome let out a weary sigh. He was really starting to hate this neighborhood.  It had been a month since the incident on Phoenix Mountain and things had all  but returned to normal ...Which was part of the problem. The following  engagement party was probably the closest he and Akane Tendo had ever come to  common ground in their relationship, only to have it sabotaged before their  very eyes by friends, rivals and well wishers alike. They had both taken it in  stride at first. After all, it was a step in the right direction however ill  fated that party may have been. But that was just it.<p>Ill-fated.</p><p>The word seemed to follow  the pigtailed boy's footsteps like some obnoxious force of nature, whipping up  trouble and chaos with wherever and whomever he went. That same word had done  wonders for his relationships. Even after being officially betrothed to one  another, the glow had only lasted a week before the reality that surrounded  Ranma reasserted itself. Homicidal fiancées. Extorting sister in-laws.  Conniving fathers. And of course, Mallet-queen herself, which was why he was  now on the roof at night instead a nice cozy futon or something. It was in  these quite moments that Ranma would take an introspective look at himself and  admit that he wasn't always the easiest person to get along with. He was  socially inept. He incited trouble at times. Could be rude. A general pain. But  a mallet a day? If not that, a burning "die, Ranma, die!" attitude.  Fun stuff, he mentally snorted. They were gonna have to try something different  if this was gonna work out at all.</p><p>"Dinner's Ready,  Ranma!"</p><p>Kasumi calling up to him.  Sure. Why not? It's not like I'm going to turn down her cooking or anything,  Ranma thought. After all, don't know when Akane will take a shot at the kitchen  next.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Urd peered  over her younger sister's shoulder intently. "Now you SURE you haven't  broken anything else?"<p>Skuld turned from her  terminal and glared menacingly at her accuser. Of course, Skuld just couldn't  project a burning stare of intimidation, so she settled on a something close to  a comical sneer instead. "I already told-"</p><p>"Ok, ok. It's not  your fault. What do we have left from that partition?"</p><p>Slightly mollified, Skuld  turned back to the transparent terminal. "Eliminating most of the bugs was  easy. It was the data reconstruction that was harder." Urd nodded and she  continued, "We were able to repair 99 of the damage, but the remains of  two files in particular have me worried."</p><p>Urd was leaned in closer.  "What sort of files are we talking about?" With the kid on repairs,  she had been pulling sysadmin lately and this was potentially need to know  information.</p><p>"Well, there were two  entities in the zone of corrupted data at the time," Skuld explained,  pulling up what remained of the files. "From what I can tell, the power  spikes were cause by a battle between these two, one mortal and one deity."  Urd's eyebrow arched slightly. "Unfortunately the file associations are so  mixed up that most of the data is missing on both. Heck, I was lucky to get the  name of just one of them!"</p><p>"Fighting one of  us?" Urd breathed incredulously. "Somebody was looking for a swift  kick in the-"</p><p>"AHEM!" Skuld  nudged her sister impatiently. "The reconstructed data says one of those  files has a terminal header."</p><p>"Ow." Urd  frowned. A fancy way of saying 'dead as a doornail.'</p><p>Skuld shook her head.  "Listen Urd, we know that the entity that left the area is alive. The  Yggradsil probably buffered it to emergency holding until we could perform a  recovery, but that will eventually be overwritten. What we don't know is his  position, status or anything else. He's probably wandering around the system as  we speak unchecked!"</p><p>Even her older sister had  to admit that was a bit troubling. "How about the other one?"</p><p>"Don't know."  Urd stated simply. "Most of the information I have was pieced together  from the remains of these two files. Heck, I'm not even sure what information  came from where..."</p><p>"Ok, let's focus on  what we DO know."</p><p>Skuld shrugged, "Ok,  the entity who walked away from Phoenix Mountain is named Ranma Saotome. The  other fighter is unknown." Urd nodded, prompting her to continue. "I <i>think</i>  this data is indicating that the Deity was a Class 1 Category 1, we just don't  know which it was or the details."</p><p>"Ranma Saotome... Now  where have I heard that name before?" Urd wondered aloud. "Can you  pull his-" Skuld pointed at the screen of jumbled data. "...file.  oh. right." Then it hit her. "HA! I think the answer is staring us  right in the face kid!" Skuld looked confused. "Face it. We're  talking about a mortal who picked a fight with one of us. Who do you think is  gonna win?"</p><p>Skuld's eyes lit up  suddenly. "I see! So the deity is..."</p><p>"Ranma Saotome, of  course." Urd proclaimed with smug satisfaction. "That's why I  recognize the name. Probably an old drinking buddy of mine or something!"</p><p>"So all I have to do  is combine the data we have into one file and let Divinity Disk Doctor rebuild  it!" the sister concluded.</p><p>"Exactly." Urd  confirmed. "Once triple-D has enough data, it should be able to recover  the details. We'll just fill in any blanks once we restore his status to the  system."</p><p>"Sometimes you're  smarter than you look, onee-chan!"</p><p>"<b>GRRR...</b>"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>At that  very moment, a similar sentiment was being vocalized halfway across eternity in  a suburb of Tokyo.<p>"<b>GRRRRR</b>WHATDIDYOUSAY?"  the youngest of the Tendo sister raged.</p><p>Ranma backed away from the  table. He knew what was coming. If the weatherman had a forecast for the day,  it would read partly cloudy, a high of fifty with a ninety percent chance of  mallets. "Come on, Akane! It was a compliment!"</p><p>"NOT <i>SO</i> MUCH  OF A TOMBOY STILL IMPLIES..." She took a menacing step forward, "<b>...THAT  I'M A TOMBOY!</b>" With that, Ranma watched her bring a familiar shape to  bear on him. Make that a 100 chance, he revised mentally. Damn weathermen never  get it right. Even if he hadn't seen the mallet, all the tell tail signs were  there. Her two older sisters, Kasumi and Nabiki had already cleared the strike  zone, while his father Genma Saotome and the Tendo's father, Soun were pulling  the food away from the table. The only question now might as well have been  which side of his face he should let her mallet.</p><p><b><i>THWAPPPP!</i></b><i> SPLoooSH!</i></p><p>The right side, as it  turned out. He also noted her aim was getting better. Normally it was a  parabolic arc that would take him well outside the neighborhood, which was a  blessing in itself. Now she was actually targeting things out of spite. What,  did she practice in her spare time? And on who? The very wet female Ranma  flipped her red ponytail off her shoulder and was about ready to step out of  the koi pond when time seemed to slow down to a crawl. She watched even as the  Tendo household ground to a halt, color draining away from the world.</p><p>"Maybe she hit me  harder than I thought..."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Ok, recombining  data!" Skuld noted enthusiastically. "Done!"<p>"Let triple D have a  crack at it." Urd directed from her younger sister's shoulder.</p><p>"Loading up."  Skuld watched as the progress bar from the display in front of her crept from  left to right, the utility scanning every bit of data it had been fed for  errors while correcting what it could. Two minutes later, Divinity Disk Doctor  prompted them with an intact file, if not entirely complete.</p><p><b>Ranma Saotome</b></p><p>Sex: Error<br/>Category: Unknown<br/>Class: Unknown<br/>Status: Recovery<br/>Area of Influence: Error<br/>Affiliation: Unknown<br/>Transport Medium: Not Found<br/>Weapon: Not Found<br/>Age: Error</p><p>The tan complexion of the  older sister's face reflected her annoyance. "That's a whole lot of  unknowns. We can't reinstate a file like that. It's not even linked to Ranma  yet."</p><p>Skuld nodded, "But at  least we have an intact file. This part will be child's play compared to the  recovery." Urd cocked her head inquisitively. "Terminal! Synchronize  File: Ranma Saotome.

"Well  that's a bit better. You said the corrupted data indicated she's a class 1,  Category 1?"</p><p>"I think so."  Skuld nodded and typed the relevant information in. "Limited or  Unlimited?"</p><p>Urd concentrated for a  moment on the name before her. So familiar... "Let's just go with  unlimited for now." Skuld cocked her head in silent question. "It's  simple kid. First, you normally don't go one-one without going all the way.  It's almost a gimmie. Second, we don't want to go offend a one-one by giving  her a lesser status. If she<i> is</i> limited, we can always go back and bust  her down later."</p><p>Again, Skuld nodded. Made  sense to her, so she typed in the relevant data. "How about the rest? The  file can't be uploaded without them..."</p><p>Again, Urd look minorly  annoyed at having to be bothered with inconsequential details. "Sigh...  Letsee, Area of Influence..." And evil grin spread across her face.  "Sex!"</p><p>Skuld shot her a glare.  "Seriously now!"</p><p>"Ok, ok... Geez, no  fun at all." Urd rolled her eyes. "How about Luck for now. As in,  she's <i>lucky</i> we saved her personnel file." Skuld typed it in.  "Affiliation...US!" Her sister shot another glance up at her.  "HEY! She is LUCKY after all, right?" Skuld sighed and continued.  "No weapon? What fun is that?" The elder sister rolled the thought  over in her head a bit. "Let's say... Um, uh.. Staves. Like it matters at  this point." Skuld put the finishing touches on the file.</p><p><b>Ranma Saotome </b></p><p>Sex: Female  Category: 1<br/>Class: 1<br/>Status: Unlimited<br/>Area of Influence: Luck<br/>Affiliation: Norns<br/>Transport Medium: Water<br/>Weapon: Staves<br/>Age: 17</p><p><b>Recovery mode.</b> <b>Commit changes:</b> Y/N?</p><p>"Looks good,  kid!"

Ranma looked... Different. Sure, her eyes were open and one foot was  poised to step out of the pond, but by the look on her face, nobody was home.  Akane cocked her head in confusion. "Uh, Ranma?"<p>Nabiki walked up behind  her, mirth evident on her face. "Honestly, Akane. How many times can you  expect to hit the boy before something up there fina-"</p><p><b><i>CRACK! BOOOOOM!</i></b></p><p>Both sisters were blown  ten feet back in a deafening roar as a shaft of divine light impaled the young  martial artist from on high. Even as the two recovered from the stunning event,  the pig-tailed girl was yanked from her station and pulled from the ground,  muscles hyper-extending, body rigid. Her head was lift skyward, dilated eyes  now registering more than just the holy pillar she was now trapped in. The beam  pulsed and fresh points of light radiated from Ranma's face. Two of the points  instantly formed blue triangles beneath her eyes, while the other concentrated  on her forehead, etching two tight vertical ovals into a figure-eight. Gravity  began to lose it tenuous hold on the pond water below, causing sparkling mist  to spiral and cascade around Ranma's transformation.</p><p>Another pulse of light hit  her, and the traditional Chinese garb she had been wearing melted into  something akin to a flowing body wrap accompanied by matching arm wraps and  fingerless glovers while loose silken streamers flowed around her as if they  had a mind of their own. The transformation continued and the pigtail unbound  itself, allowing her flowing red hair to grow several lengths before returning  to it's previous binding. It too wrapping around her person, flowing to the  super natural breeze. Finally, the twin ovals etched upon her forehead merged  into one tight vertical eye, blazing in supernatural glory into the sky before  fading with the pillar itself.</p><p>Peace flowed back across  the Tendo Dojo once more.</p><p>The entire household had  now emptied itself into the courtyard, only to find themselves gaping at an  impossible sight- an ethereal red headed beauty, feet drifting inches above  the koi pond and bathing the general vicinity in a soft glowing aura. Her head  rested on her shoulder as if she had drifted off into a peaceful sleep.</p><p>The Tendo's gaped. Genma's  eyes stared in disbelief. Any and all logic had been washed from their brains  as they stared at what had only moments ago been a simple pig-tailed girl.</p><p>"R-R-Ranma?"  Akane stuttered, as one was likely to do after witnessing such an event. Ranma  barely stirred at the sound of her name. "W-What should we do..?"</p><p>Nabiki knew exactly what  to do. "He's you're fiancé. YOU wake him up."</p><p>Akane turned to the others  in a plea for support, only to find she had been unanimously elected to the  task by the disturbing lack of eye contact. She took in the sight once more.  "Uh, ok then...?"</p><p>Her trepid walk to the koi  pond took nearly five minutes as she edged closer to the water's edge and  further into Ranma's peaceful glow. The mist continued to float around her,  though in lesser quantity, tracing lazy flight paths around a center of  serenity. Akane could feel it too. Peace. Calm. She almost didn't even want to  disturb the moment. Ranma nuzzled her own shoulder contently. Ok, here it  goes... Akane steeled herself for the event.</p><p>"Um, Ranma?" She  tugged at the pig-tailed girls hand, barely able to reach it from the ponds  edge and her ground locked vantage point. Ranma stirred. "Ranma, can you  hear me?" Eyes fluttered and Akane's world dissolved. Such blue eyes...  Unending. Peaceful... Wrapping around her...</p><p>Ranma blinked groggily,  the first thing coming into focus being the intense gaze of Akane Tendo. Ranma  let a small smile escape her lips, at least until she realized something was  slightly amiss. Why was he looking DOWN at her? And where was that glow coming  from? And why am I floating above the koi... pond? Ranma twitched and wiggled  her feet. Air. Then she found the rest of the household... Staring. She looked  down once more, beyond her feet and into the waters reflection below. She  was... It was... Her clothing...</p><p>And with that, Ranma  Saotome, Goddess of Luck first class, category one, unlimited... passed out.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Chapter  TWO</b><p><b>R</b>anma blinked groggily, the  concerned faces of Akane, Kasumi and surprisingly his mother, Nodoka Saotome  filtering into view. While the latter two were obviously concerned, Akane was  concerned... And a bit dazed as well, if he was were any judge. Near as he  could tell, he was flat on his back in the Tendo living room. And it was  morning? Besides wondering what exactly had happened, a more pressing matter  came to mind.</p><p>"Akane..." The  fiancée leaned closer, obviously unsure what to expect at this point. Silently  Ranma noted his voiced carried that of his feminine alter ego. "Don't <i>ever  </i>use THAT mallet on me again."</p><p>Akane stiffened slightly  in surprise, the dazed state finally broken. "B-Baka!" her cheeks  flushed, though there was little anger behind her retort.</p><p>The redhead sat up a bit  and found the rest of the family gathered around her in much the same  condition. "So... What'd I miss?" Nabiki simply point to her person  and Ranma glanced down. What could she be…? Her clothing! Ranma flinched  visibly, noting the drastic change to her wardrobe. His three care givers  stepped aside as Ranma stood up, wondering who the wise guy was. She looked at  the elegant robe she now wore and the streams floating gently around as if  carried by the wind. "You've got to be kidding me…" Ranma thought  aloud, taking in the changes. She immediately crossed every male she knew off  the potential prankster list. The robe was just too elegant to be a guy's  practical joke. Somebody like his father or the old pervert Happosai would  sooner fit him to a brazier than something like... This. That, and he didn't  know any females that would go through this level of trouble just to dress her  up so dramatically. Ranma's facial expression clearly indicated she was at a  total loss. Even her ponytail had lengthened its glowing cord of red hair,  highlighted with an elegant white ribbon.</p><p>"Do you remember the  light?" Nabiki asked tentatively. She had absolutely no clue what had  happened even after seeing it herself, but regardless, there could be quite a  bit of profit involved in the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts Designer  Fashion arena if she did.</p><p>Ranma blinked, the  question triggering hazy memories. Nerve endings on fire... The pure light  coursing through her entire body... The feeling of total peace... Changing...  But into what? "I… I remember... But it's all hanging just out of  reach..."</p><p>Nabiki described the  entire sequence in great detail as Ranma tested his footing. "I even took  a few pictures, but the light totally washed them out," she observed with  dismay, handing him one of the blighted photos. "We're pretty sure the  floating bit was an optical illusion."</p><p>"Er, floating?"  She watched the entire family- save Nodoka who had arrived too late to witness  the event -nod in confirmation. "Eh, right. I think I'll go outside and  get some..." Kasumi Tendo halted Ranma mid sentence by silently handing  him a mirror. It took less than a second to find the triangles that had taken  up residence directly beneth her eyes and the hollow oval imbedded into her  forehead. Her fingers traced them tentatively. They were actually a part of  her. She could <i>feel </i>them. "Maybe I'll just take a nice long bath first,  then." Like I'm going to be able to just wash them off, Ranma mentally  huffed.</p><p>The bath, as it turned  out, lasted less than ten minutes.</p><p>The household had just  started to sink back into some semblance of a normal breakfast routine when the  bathroom door slid open unexpectedly early. Everybody paused, including Kasumi,  who was just laying out dishes for breakfast. To a visitor, the problem  wouldn't have been obvious. Ranma now had on her favorite Chinese shirt and  pants, though the markings still adorned her grumpy expression. That, however,  was not the problem. The entire household recognized it immedietly, however.</p><p>"Um, Ranma..."  Akane started hesitantly, only to be finished by the slightly more direct  Nabiki Tendo.</p><p>"Why are you still a  girl?"</p><p>"I was wondering the  exact same thing," she grumbled, light sarcasm rolling to no one in  particular. Genma Saotome gaped. Nodoka leaned forward in concern. No male  Ranma meant no wedding. No wedding meant no Dojo. For Nodoka, it also meant the  irrelevance of her vision for Ranma becoming a Manly Man Among Men, and the  grip on her ever-present katana did not go unnoticed. Ranma simply grabbed a  roll from the table. "I think I'll be taking that walk now."</p><p>A block later and two  sisters in tow, Ranma tried to sort things out. Akane had followed out of sheer  concern. Ranma still a girl AND skipping breakfast? Warning lights lit up all  over the place. For Nabiki, it was the chance to observe her cash cow a bit  more closely. An answer was bound to turn up sooner or later. Ranma, however,  was in deep thought. She had known the moment she stepped into the bathroom  only an hour earlier that it wasn't going to work, just like she had known the  markings on her face simply wouldn't go away. Normally the situation would  drive her up the wall as it had in the past, as Ranma knew all too well what a  permanent stay in her girl-type meant. But the towering resentment of shame  just wasn't there this time, as if she knew deep down that this was the natural  order of things. That alone was annoying the snot out her beyond anything else,  not the fact that she was trapped as a girl for an unknown amount of time. Just  knowing stuff without rhyme or reason was very-</p><p>"Oh look, 500  yen!" Nabiki stopped short, finding the little treasure on the ground.  Ranma and Akane stopped as well.</p><p><i>SPlooSH!</i></p><p>Ranma's eyes widened and  glanced to what her next step down the sidewalk would have been if not for  Nabiki's find. A familiar old lady had just seen fit to dump an entire bucket  of cold water out into the street, the contense of which now drained at Ranma's  feet. Ranma looked at it incredulously as Nabiki secured her find.</p><p>"What's up with  you?" She asked the entranced little redhead.</p><p>"It missed."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"It NEVER  misses."</p><p>Nabiki shrugged and  flipped her newfound fortune into the air. "Lucky break for the both of us  then."</p><p>Akane nodded and pulled  Ranma along. "Let's get you to Tofu. You're acting too weird for your own  good."</p><p>Small wonder, Ranma  thought. Not that the water would have done anything to him in girl-form  anyway, but...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Skuld  bounced happily into the shrine, shattering the tranquil breakfast Belldandy  and her fiancé were engaged in. "I fixed it! I fixed it!"<p>"WE" Urd closed  the door behind the exuberant girl, "...fixed it."</p><p>Keiichi blinked.  "Fixed what?"</p><p>"The girls had a  small problem with the Yggradsil last night," Belldandy supplied with a  smile. A beautiful smile, Keiichi noted. "But apparently everything turned  out ok!"</p><p>"Yeah!" Skuld  agreed with glee, "Ranma owes us BIG for saving her file!"</p><p>Belldandy stopped short of  her next sip of tea. "Ranma?"</p><p>"The One-One  unlimited we restored." Her big sister Urd finished. "We're gonna  have to iron out a few of the details in the interview today, but overall, not  bad work for me and the little Squirt here."</p><p>"HEY! Who's a little  Squirt?" the youngest of the three goddess fumed, locking horns with her  sister.</p><p>"You are, OF  COURSE!" Urd flashed back, nose to nose with the aforementioned Squirt.</p><p>Even as Keiichi stepped in  to break the two up, he noticed his beloved, deep thought evident on her face.  Keiichi stepped back and knelt down beside his fiancée with an unspoken  question.</p><p>"I haven't heard of a  goddess named Ranma." Belldandy answered the silence.</p><p>"Heaven's a big  place, right?" Keiichi theorized, throwing out the possibility that maybe  she just hadn't run into her yet.</p><p>She shook her head.  "Not when you're a Class one, category one unlimited. It's a small circle  of deitis that hold that title."</p><p>Keiichi nodded. If anyone  would know, it would be his Bell-chan. "Well, Urd mentioned an interview.  We could always tag a-"</p><p><i>Ring-Ring!</i></p><p>Keiichi sighed. "Be  right back." The young man made his way across the dining room, taking  great pains not to be sucked into the escalating conflict taking place between  youngest and oldest sister. "Hello?" Keiichi's eyes widened as the  voice on the other end spoke. "Uh, of course!" Belldandy watched him  curiously. "Kami-sama. For you."</p><p>All hostilities instantly  ceased, Urd and Skuld declaring a truce as Belldandy took the phone from her  future husband. "Yes, Father? Uh-huh? Of course. I love you too.  Bye!" Keiichi noted that conversations with God tended to be very  one-sided. With a light click, Belldandy set the receiver down on the hook,  looking up at her fiancé in amusement. "He approves of your idea."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki was  worried. Oh sure, Ranma had just undergone an inexplicable transformation,  floated and whatnot, but it was the money that was beginning to worry her. And  Akane. And Ranma, to a lesser extent, who had been experiencing weird stuff his  entire life. Not that she wasn't opposed to the prospect of acquiring and  retain money per say, but their walk to Dr. Tofu's place had already produced  2000 yen in loose change, just lying around in their path.<p>"Maybe you should  give it back..." Akane whispered hesitantly.</p><p>She was rewarded with the  arch of a sisterly eyebrow. "Give it back to who, exactly?" Akane  shrugged. "Exactly. If somebody wants to leave money lying around on the  street, who am I to argue?"</p><p>"2000 yen's worth!"</p><p>"ESPECIALLY 2000  yen's worth," Nabiki confirmed. Be that as it may, she realized Akane had  a point. Either everybody had holes in their pockets today or she was on one  massive streak of good luck.</p><p>Ranma retained his  silence. Weird stuff was a foot in a very obvious manner. It wasn't the weird  stuff that crept up on you from the shadows, like so many other events in his  life. This weird stuff was tap dancing all around her today. It was very  unnerving, especially after what she'd been through so far. She turned to  continue their walking and the fence on her left exploded outward in a sheet of  dust and splinters. Ranma took a tentative step back. Ryoga stood there in a  striking stance, as if expecting somebody's head to be occupying the space his  fist now resided. If that had hit... the consequences flashed through her mind.  She had gotten off ...lucky? Something resonated deep within Ranma, flowing  inexplicably through her being.</p><p>Ryoga blinked, astonished  to find the female Ranma inches removed from his attack. To his credit, the  Lost Boy recovered quickly. "CURSE YOU SAOTOME! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH  AKAN-" Ranma pointed back at the two sisters, who had observed the entire  exchange. "Ryoga-kun!" Akane exclaimed and pulled him into a hug.  "Where have you been! We missed you!"</p><p>"Some of us, at any  rate." Ranma quipped, earning bonk on the head from her fiancée.</p><p>The jibe blew right past  Ryoga. Somehow, he had stumbled across his rival Ranma Saotome and found Akane  Tendo all on the same day. The odds of him finding such specific people at  specific times given his propensity for misnavigation were astronomically long.</p><p>As Akane and Ryoga caught  up with one another, Nabiki walked with Ranma. "So... What's going  on?"</p><p>Ranma instantly knew what  she meant. The word 'coincidence' just wasn't covering a day like today.  "I was hoping you could tell me."</p><p>"I'm not the one  found floating above a koi pond."</p><p>"True." The  redhead conceded. "But at east I got those marks to go away,"  pointing to her forehead. At least his hard earned concentration had earned her  something.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>And from a  roof blocks away, demonic eyes studied the teenagers, blonde locks swaying  gently in the wind. So that's the new one, the demoness thought with a tooth  and fang grin. Let's see how their newest Goddess likes my Hellhounds...<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma  stopped so suddenly that the chatting Ryoga and Akane almost ran into her.  Something flashed through her brain. A warning. Something was wrong. Ryoga's  protest was cut short as the pig tailed girl dropped into a battle stance- not  the sparring stance that the two usually dueled with. He could feel her power  levels prime and instantly knew something was about to go very wrong. Nudging  the questioning sisters back, Ryoga took up Ranma's flank in the road.<p>"Anybody you know?"</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>"Anybody <i>I </i>know?"</p><p>Ranma smirked at the Lost  Boy. Eternal rivals they may be, but the two lived and died by the exact same  martial arts code, which in this twisted universe made them brothers. Or  brother and sister, in this particular case. "Beats me, but whatever they  are, they're powerful and reek of deadly intent."</p><p>Ryoga focused on the area  around him, detecting noth- Wait... He could feel the faintest trace of their  opponent creeping in. Chatting with Akane, he would have never felt it period.  But Ranma had. A full ten seconds before him and without having to focus.  "Got em. Barely. If I'd have continued chatting they'd be all over us  before we knew it."</p><p>Ranma nodded. She would  have been in close to the same position if not for the changes she was still  trying to define. If she could nail down the position...</p><p><b><i>RAWWAAAArrrALLL!</i></b></p><p>Ranma and Ryoga spun  around and found themselves facing... Dogs. Or some sick parody of them, their  primary features being lots of horns, razor sharp talons and drool. Lots and  LOTS of drool. Ryoga had no trouble feeling the lion sized beasts now. Infact,  their power was bleeding all over the place. This wasn't going to be pretty.  "What have you dragged me into this time, Saotome?"</p><p>Ranma gave him a toothy  grin. "Hey, I didn't punch through a wall to find you, remember?"</p><p>The hairless animals began  to circle opposite one another while Ranma and Ryoga took point, Akane and  Nabiki pressed against an apartment wall.</p><p>"Ranma, I  can-!" Akane quailed, only to be cut off.</p><p>"No! They're way out  of your league." Ranma stated bluntly. Sure, it would probably hurt her  pride, but better that than risk her life to what was for all intents and  purposes a killing machine.</p><p>The animals tensed to  strike. Ryoga beat them to the punch.</p><p>"<i>Bakusai Tenkestsu!</i>"</p><p>The point of his finger  hit the ground, ripping concrete from the street in a storm that consumed the  first animal, followed by flurry of razor sharp bandanas for good measure  before launching into the cloud himself. Ranma's hellhound charged at that very  instant, the pig-tailed girl meeting it head on with her Tenshin Amaguriken  technique. The beast not only took the hundred fist attack, but took it head  on, breaching the technique and slashing the girl sideway. She turned the  aerial tumble into a graceful landing and knew she had given better than she  got in the opening round, but the beast was built like a tank. Even as the  monster shook it off and reared its ugly head, the other was thrown from  Ryoga's cloud of dust and into the neighboring wall with a satisfying crunch.  Ranma spared a glance at her partner, who already was already breathing heavy.  The red bamboo umbrella came off his back and the battle rejoined. Again,  Ranma's hound charged, this time meeting a ball of ki energy courtesy of her  Moko Takabisha as the girl stepped it up a notch. Blowing the creature back 20  feet did nothing to dissuade another bestial charge. This time, Ranma wanted it  in close.</p><p>Ryoga was able to get in  three savage strikes with the super dense umbrella before his monster caught  the weapon in its jaws, snapping the thing in half. The Lost Boy got in another  pulverizing fist to the dog's mid-section before being brutally gouged by its  horns, forcing him to break contact. Ryoga knew he was getting through, KNEW he  was doing damage, but the thing just kept coming back for more. Normally he  didn't have any doubts about his ability to withstand punishment, but this  beast was taking that concept taken to an entirely new level. Another charge.  "<i>Shinshi Houkou Dan!</i>" and dog was blown back by Ryoga's own  energy blast.</p><p>Ranma too, was getting  bloodied as she took her animal hand to hand. Normally she would have  pulverized it with a variety of attacks at range like any other animal, but  even though she had been doing that, it just wasn't enough. She needed to know  what made this thing tick and where to best hit it, and the only way she could  do that was by learning the hard way. Avoid the razor jaws. Deflect the  rapiers. Sense the chi-flow through its body... <i>CRACK!</i> Ranma was against  the brick wall having taken its club tail to the stomach. Now it was her turn  to shake it off. That's when she realized that the only way to beat these  things was to go all out. Time was not on their side, and while she'd be more  than happy to lead the hateful creature into a spiral of death, she needed open  space. Two non-combatants and neighborhood jammed with apartment wasn't the  place for that move.</p><p>"Ryoga! We need some  room!" Ranma called out as she blasted the Dog away with another ki-blast.</p><p>Ryoga puzzled for a moment  before the reason snapped into place. It was perhaps Ranma's biggest strength,  but in this situation it was his biggest weakness. Their opponents were  overpowering in hand to hand and even their best mid ranged attacks merely stunned  the beasts. To take them out for good, Ranma was going to have to rely on his  impressive arsenal of super-moves, which were the equivalents to Martial Arts  weapons of mass destruction... Great to be used on some remote mountain in  China but very VERY bad news for a neighborhood in Nerima, Japan. With that in  mind, Ryoga began blowing the street apart with his Breaking Point technique in  an effort to herd his animal into a side street and ultimately a nearby field  while Ranma did the same with her ki blasts. The tactic worked for all of about  twenty seconds. Sure, they could start the process, but as soon as they strayed  too far from the Tendos', the beasts would take advantage of that defensive  weakness and attempt to maul the girls. Whether it was tactics or simply an  instinctual anchor, the dog's unflinching position ensured they would threaten  every piece in this game while limiting Saotome's offense.</p><p>The pig tailed girl's head  pounded for a solution even as she slid in for another attack. Ranma was tough.  Ryoga was tougher. But these things were tanks with legs. The dog's overall  damage wasn't that spectacular, but when combined with their insane stamina and  ability to soak up damage, the odds were heavily weighted against the home  team. She was sure she <i>could</i> take them down, but only by flattening  every building in the area and in all probability killing their occupants.  Again, it was only a matter of time before they'd have to make some unpleasant  decisions based on their dwindling reserves. Then the animal was all over Ranma  now, its weight pinning her down as the girl struggled to keep it's snapping  jaws at bay.</p><p>Something in the back of  her mind began to creep forward. It was leaking out from behind the mental  barriers she had been using to suppress "it". It was something too  strange, too alien to allow free reign around her mind and body, so she  continued to push it back. Ryoga stumbled and the beast had his arm, shredding  flesh and muscle. They were the only things that stood between the monsters and  the Tendo sisters, who were all but paralyzed in fear. The last line of  defense. Period.</p><p>"Awww, I'm going to  SO regret this..!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>On the  building blocks away, Mara watched the scene with glee. The two were actually  quite good to have lasted this long using conventional tactics, but if her new  goddess kept that up, it was only a matter of time before she became kibble.  The demoness' face crinkled. Speaking of that, why was she holding back? If I  were her, I would have done it-<p>Mara's eyes lit up. "Oh!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Half a  suburb away, Urd and Belldandy leaned back in the air-conditioned room, awed by  the display of gluttony in front of them. In fact, the eldest sister was close  to taking bets on just how many colors Skuld's face could turn as the youngest  stuffed herself.<p>"MMMMMmmmm...  Awwwww... Iccceee creeeeeeeammmm..." Skuld moaned with delight, the colors  of several different flavors plastering her lips.</p><p>"Can we PLEASE get on  with our search?" Urd huffed in annoyance. Besides, what was the big deal  about ice cream, anyway? Sake, yes. Ice cream, no. Of course, you could combine  the two... Wait. She had tried that once. The result was less than desirable.</p><p>Skuld simply stuck her  tongue out and took another spoon full. Nothing could separate her from her ice  cream n-</p><p>"Oh!" Belldandy  exclaimed suddenly.</p><p>Urd nodded "I felt  that too."</p><p>Skuld's spoon halted its  ascent as she watched her two older sisters suddenly grow serious.  "What?"</p><p>"Demons."  Belldandy frowned.</p><p>"Back on the clock,  Kiddo!" Urd stated, yanking the spoon from her hand, dragging the teenager  out the door and into the air while Belldandy led the way. The trio flew  through the sky, homing in on the foul source of energy. It took nearly 15  minutes to localize the source and they arrived just in time to find the  hellhounds all over their prey.</p><p>Belldandy took quick stock  of the situation. For mortals, they had done a credible job hold the hounds at  bay. She could even see the monster's Chi had taken a severe beating, but the  mortals were in the same boat and had <i>a lot</i> less staying power.</p><p>"We're going to have  to intervene, Sis." Urd stated evenly, a demeanor of ice descending across  her facial features. Belldandy nodded and powered up for a surprise attack.  Skuld pulled out a complex looking bomb from the folds of her yellow raincoat,  ready to lend fire support. Urd's own hand began to glow, a small menacing ball  forming in her palm. "Alright, let's do th-!"</p><p>Before she could finish,  the strike zone abruptly flared to life.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The change  washed over Ranma Saotome like a soothing breeze, blowing both beasts across  the street in a shockwave of hard light. Ryoga could only stare as her clothing  evaporated in place of an elegant body wrap and silken red braiding to replace  the pigtail. Once again, she hovered inches off the ground as her divine being  reasserted itself, the facial marks now plainly visible. Glowing. Connecting.  With eternity. Her eyes opened lazily, their azure pools glowing with life and  vitality. Ryoga simply gaped, and she knew the girls to her back were doing the  same once more. She was still Ranma... And <i>more</i>. It was very unnerving  from her point of view.<p><i>RRRrrowwo-!</i> <b>BOOM!</b></p><p>A hound had recovered,  resuming its attack on Ryoga. The newly minted goddess made her displeasure  felt. Ranma had no idea as to the extent of her power now, but the energy blast  that reflexively departed from her outstretched hands at high speed was a good  indication. Before it could leap on the distracted Ryoga, her ki blast blew a  large chunk out of the animals side, sending it down range and into its very  own smoldering crater. Amazingly enough, the creature lived ..In a  significantly reduced fashion. The other hound made its move and Ranma let it  come, narrowly avoiding it's viscous lunge with ease while tapping one of the  creatures jagged horns ever so lightly as it flew by. The angular momentum from  that simple tap sent the monster careening out of control at high velocity and  into the opposite wall where it too made a crater. The Goddess winked at the  dumbfounded Ryoga. "You just gonna sit their all day ...P-Chan?" Even  her voice sounded more feminine, she noticed with irritation.</p><p>That snapped him out of  it. Not that he was any less amazed and dumbstruck, but the jibe had succeeded  in bringing the Lost Boy back into the world of combat awareness. He stared at  one recovering hound, then the other. Ranma had just reduced twenty minutes of  life and death struggle to mere child's play!</p><p>"DAMN YOU, SAOTOME,  WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU DO THAT SOONER?"</p><p>Ranma's smile disappeared.  Would he even listen? Realize the conflict that still raged within her? She  didn't even know what she was, let alone what was happening to her. And he  could be damn sure that once they were done with these monstrosities, she'd  stuff whatever it was back where it came from! She was still considering Ryoga  when the beasts stirred once more to form a flanking maneuver on the helpless  sisters. But they were slow. So slow to her...</p><p>And before she could blast  them herself, the hellhounds disappeared in a volley of fire and light, ripped  apart by firepower from on high. Strangers? No. Familiar somehow. Not that  Ranma knew too many people that could just up and hover 100 feet off the ground  like these three did. Ranma blinked. Another piece to this twisted little  puzzle, maybe?</p><p>Mara took the lord's name  in vain. Several times, in fact. Granted, the hellhounds were just a gage of  the Goddess' ability, but that ability had proven to be quite substantial. Now  she was convince that this one had just been showing off by fighting the Hounds  in mortal form for so long. Mara ground her fangs together in disgust as three  familiar Goddesses descended on the area. Regardless, her mission was done.  Time to get the heck out of Dodge before they found out who precipitated these  events.</p><p>Urd nudged her youngest  sister as the trio floated lightly to the ground. "See? I KNEW I've seen  her before!" Granted, she still couldn't place from where, but she  definitely knew that face...</p><p>Skuld stared at the  redhead in amazement. "S-Sugoi!" It was the first time Skuld had  really seen anything like her fighting style. Urd was plenty powerful, but she  was a bar room brawler. Belldandy could bring out the big guns, but only with  great reluctance. Ranma, however, was an artist. Her grace in combat was only  matched by the efficiency with which she employed her technique, something she  doubted either sister could come close to matching. Even as a mortal, she had  been holding her own against the Hellhounds and the step up to goddess had only  augmented those attributes. The hounds' fate had been sealed with or without  their help. A glance over to Belldandy told a different story. Her peaceful  smile was in place, but Skuld knew her well enough to see that she was...  concerned. There wasn't any reason for her to have even accompanied them, but  now the youngest sister was thinking maybe that wasn't the case.</p><p>Skuld wasn't the only one  sizing up the redhead. Urd gave the puzzled girl a once-over and approved.  Attractive, but in top form. An excellent brawler and if she were any judge and  somebody who wouldn't take crap from anybody. To the surprise of the mortals  behind Ranma, Urd stepped up and pulled Ranma into a hug. "It's wonderful  to see you again, Ranma! How long has it been?"</p><p>Ranma's transformation had  been amazing enough. Three girls falling out of the sky only increased the  weirdness factor by several magnitudes. But one of them hugging Ranma with  absolute familiarity? Akane snapped.</p><p>"You've got to be  kidding me!" She instantly became the center of attention for two mortals  and four goddesses. "JUST HOW MANY FIANCEES DO YOU HAVE, PERVERT?"  Urd twitched. Fiancées? A familiar shape rose into view and Akane swung for the  fences.</p><p>But missed.</p><p>Her over-swing sent her  tripping between Ranma and Urd, who effortlessly disengaged from each other  before the mallet found its mark. Nabiki blinked. Ranma? Avoid Akane's mallet?  Of course, she was of the opinion that normally Ranma just didn't care enough  to avoid the dang thing as his skill easily eclipsed her younger sisters, but  now Ranma showed no hesitation in displaying just how effortless the act was in  reality.</p><p>Ranma was about to try to  calm his fiancée down when he looked at the three newcomers who were themselves  wondering what was going on now. She stopped. She couldn't. She couldn't  explain a dang thing to the enraged girl, Ranma suddenly realized. What was she  going to say? "It's not what you think?" Ranma mentally laughed.  Heck, she didn't even know what was happening, let alone who these women were  or why one had hugged her as if she where long time friend. So in place of an  explanation, Ranma let out a tired sigh.</p><p>"RANMA SAOTOME, YOU  ENEMY OF WOMEN!" Ryoga's temper boiled over as the women he cared for was  set to rage. He looked as if he was about to attack, but something held him in  check, namely the smoldering remains of two dog monsters and the three women  around the pig-tailed girl. Somehow, she fit right in with the three.</p><p>Ranma's head dropped.  Couldn't anything EVER go right?</p><p><i>WHiiFF! WHiFFWhiff!</i></p><p>The black haired girl was  tenacious, Skuld noted as Akane Tendo attempted another few swings at the  goddess they had come to talk to. She'd probably have made an excellent  debugger with that mallet of hers ...if she weren't so emotionally unstable.  Whew! Imagine that sort of temper running around the Yggradsil!</p><p>Finally out of breath, the  angry girl set the mallet aside and settled for a spiteful glare.  "Hmmmf!" and with that, took an equally angered Ryoga in hand,  "WE'RE going back to the Dojo! You can do whatever you want with your new  girlfriends!" stomping off. Nabiki simply shrugged and followed them.</p><p>Urd poked Ranma. "Are  they ALWAYS like that?" Mentally exhausted, Ranma simply nodded.  "Even Skuld isn't that bad."</p><p>The teenager was just  about to go off when Belldandy stepped in. "Maybe we should choose a less  public place to conduct the interview." Skuld glared, but was defused.  Ranma's attention focused. Interview? Urd had noticed the attention the  destroyed side street was gathering as bystanders stopped to gape.</p><p>"Well, how about the  Dojo?" Ranma offered. First, it was familiar ground, something she so  desperately needed at this point. Second, it had food. Third, she owed these  strangers. "I'm sure we can get Kasumi to whip up something to eat while  we sort out this mess."</p><p>"Sake?" Urd  asked hopefully. Ranma smiled.</p><p>"Sure." Maybe  she should have some too after today.</p><p>"Ice Cream?"  Skuld's eyes lit up.</p><p>"Uh, I guess."  The girl was entirely too eager for a frozen treat.</p><p>Belldandy smiled at the  kind offer. There maybe something wrong with this case, but the offer was  sincere enough to take a liking to the unknown girl. "We would be happy to  accept."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Without  Ryoga, Akane or Nabiki in tow, the walk home was actually quite peaceful, Ranma  noted as she chatted with the sisters. Through conversation and sisterly  violence, Ranma came to know the beautiful bronze skinned sister as Urd, who  absolutely insisted she knew her from somewhere. Ranma was pretty sure she'd  have recognized that striking white mane anywhere, but kept her silence. The  youngest was Skuld, whose back-slung hammer caused him to mentally flinch every  time she saw it. Thankfully, its owner was a tad saner and it was obvious that  Skuld had taken an immediate liking to her. Or the ice cream she had promised,  Ranma wasn't sure which. Belldandy was the quieter one, the peace centering  around her reminding Ranma of Kasumi Tendo. She was sure that the quiet pair  would get along famously once they met. Occasionally their chat would mention  "the file," but that was normally being brushed aside with talk about  "the interview," which would be done over food. And sake. And Ice  cream. She'd have to remember to do Kasumi a huge favor later on.<p>The sun was setting just  as the four found the Tendo household, Ranma sliding the door open to find...</p><p>"HOW COULD YOU DO  THIS TO MY POOR LITTLE GIRL?" The spirit of Soun Tendo raged, growing out  of control. "You're supposed to marry MY AKANE, not some Fiancée of the  week!"</p><p>Ranma was just about to straiten  things out when his father stepped up beside Soun. "Use some common sense,  Boy! You can't go making fiancées everywhere you go! After all-"</p><p>Genma Saotome never  finished. Ranma twitched violently. "I can't...? THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T  HAVE TRIED TO SELL ME TO SO MANY OF THEM!" ...And removed his father from  the scene by gripping his Gi and flipping him into the koi pond. The result was  predictable. The three sisters only registered mild surprise as a wet Panda  broke the surface with a sign labeled "Spoiled brat!" Skuld snorted.  Jerk. Ranma turned to face the angered Tendo, who she felt a twinge more  respect for. "These women ARE NOT fiancées. They're..." She hesitated  for a moment. Yes, she could say this honesty, even though she'd never seen the  women before today, "...good friend." Belldandy smiled, Urd produced  a mischievous grin and Skuld waved happily. "I assume you heard about the  incident today?" Soun's anger was instantly transformed to intense concern  and nodded silently. "My friends here were instrumental in helping us out  of a tight spot."</p><p>With that announcement,  Soun Tendo's demeanor shifted 360 degrees. "Well! If that's the case, come  right in! Have you eaten dinner yet, young ladies?"</p><p>Kasumi had heard the  commotion and had taken her place beside her father, bowing to the new guests.  Contrary to what she'd heard from Akane, she seriously doubted that any one of  these three were Ranma's fiancée, especially given the fact that their dresses  mirrored that of Ranma's transformation so closely. If she thought on the fact  long enough, the four almost looked like... Sisters? And Ranma seemed genuinely  pleased to be in their company, something she had only seen rarely and not for  a while now. Kasumi had no doubts whatsoever that these were Ranma's friends  and she made the observation clearly known, if not for Ranma, then for the rest  of the family in the background. ESPECIALLY for a bitter little sister.  "Any <i>friends</i> of Ranma's are always welcome! Come sit down with  us."</p><p>Ranma bowed her head in  silent acknowledgement of Kasumi's support and she smiled in turn. If there  were two people that were the most misunderstood in the entire household, it  was them. Kasumi knew that Ranma was not the lecherous, unthoughtful cad he was  continually portrayed as and Ranma knew that there was all sorts of  intelligence ticking away beneath Kasumi's peaceful demeanor, which was  continually underestimated simply because she was content with her station in  life. While sparks had never ignited between the two, there was a solid mutual  respect, deeper than the rest of the family probably suspected. Three more  guests would create more work for her, but she knew Ranma, and he- no,<i> she</i>  -would find a way to pay her back in the future, even if she never requested  the help.</p><p>The three sat and Ranma  made introduction as Kasumi passed around plates. With the heads of the  household firmly in support of Ranma and her new friends, Akane loosened her  hold on the anger she'd carried for the last half hour. Nabiki, already  somewhat familiar having observed the three, made easy introductions. Genma  eyed the four wearily and Nodoka simply smiled with curiosity. As predicted,  Belldandy and Kasumi made fast friends, Belldandy quickly moving to help Kasumi  with dinner.</p><p>With the food distributed,  everybody dug in and Ranma refraining from her usual display of gluttony in  deference to the company. She watched as the grip on her father's chopsticks  changed and shot him a menacing glare. Genma froze as those super-natural azure  globes swirled with warning and anger. Her look made it obvious that the  stealing of food would NOT be tolerated tonight and that she had the firepower  to back that silent ultimatum up. Genma shrank back in shock and returned to  his own plate, sufficiently cowed. Ranma knew the household. Knew her life, and  knew the longer she waited, the higher the chances some chaotic storm of events  would blow through and remove her only sources of information on what was  happening. She couldn't afford to wait any longer.</p><p>"So... About the file?"  She started off, catching the attention of the three goddesses.</p><p>Urd nodded. "I assume  things have been a tad odd recently?" Ranma nodded. "Well, you can  thank Jusendo for that."</p><p>Ranma's eyes widened, as  did the rest of the household. . Jusendo. The battle for his life. The place  where Akane died and was reborn. "What does Jusendo have to do...?"  Her voice trailed off in wonder.</p><p>"Somehow, your  activities in the area destabilized the Yggradsil," Skuld explained.  Yggradsil? "causing an overload and massive loss of data. Your file was  damaged and the Yggradsil shunted your essesance to emergency storage until we  could find and repair it."</p><p>Overload? Data? Emergency  storage? Ranma looked to Nabiki, who was usually up on modern technology for a  clue. The sister gave him a barely perceptible shrug. None at all.</p><p>"You were lucky,  Girl." Urd nudged Ranma. "We couldn't even recover the other guys  file."</p><p>"Saffron's?"</p><p>Belldandy's eyes widened  suddenly. A piece of the puzzle had just fallen into place. "You <i>knew</i>  Saffron?" Ranma could see the recognition in her eyes and nodded.  "And what... happened to him?"</p><p>Ranma's eyes flashed with  anger then softened. All eyes were on her, but she couldn't answer.</p><p>"He killed him."  Ryoga broke the uneasy silence. For Akane. It was nothing to be ashamed of in  his eyes.</p><p>Urd and Skuld nodded in  agreement. "So that's who the terminal header belonged to..." Skuld  finished.</p><p>"Well  regardless," Urd carried on. "we recovered yours and synchronized it  to you, so there should be no further problems. We just need to get a few  details out of the-"</p><p>"Stop." Urd and  Skuld twisted around to their sister's direct order in surprise.</p><p>"Stop?"</p><p>"Yes." Belldandy  stated firmly and turned to Ranma and bowed low to the table. "You must  accept our most profound apologize... We had no idea of the trouble we have  caused you."</p><p>"It was just a  standard file recovery, Sis. No real-" Belldandy cut the youngest sister  off uncharacteristically.</p><p>"Your recovery has  gone terribly wrong, Sister." the eldest stated directly. "Saffron  was the God."</p><p>Both Skuld and Urd froze,  the implications of what she just said sinking in.</p><p>"So Ranma  isn't..."</p><p>"No."</p><p>Urd's gut had turned to  solid ice and Skuld looked to be on the edge of passing out. "But that would  still mean Ranma-"</p><p>"Yes." Belldandy  confirmed, already knowing her train of thought. "Saffron died that day on  Phoenix Mountain and Ranma escaped the Yggradsil crash."</p><p>"Oooh boy, Kami-sama  is going to have our butts for this one." Urd breathed with trepidation.</p><p>Ranma cleared her throat  softly, getting their attention. "So what does all this have to do with  me?"</p><p>Belldandy decided to let  her sisters continue to sort things out and explain. It was perfectly obvious  to her now just what had happened, and why Kami-sama had thought it a good idea  for her to come along.</p><p>"As Skuld mentioned,  your activities in China caused a massive destabilization of our system,  creating wide spread data loss. The loss was so bad that your file was damaged,  as was Saffron's, which became unrecoverable." Ranma nodded as Belldandy  put more pieces into place. "When it came time to recover your file, parts  of Saffron's files were mistaken for your own and when you were restored to the  system, you were restored as..." She took a deep breath, as if not  believing it herself.</p><p>"...Ranma Saotome,  Goddess of Luck First class, Category One, unlimited."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Chapter  THREE</b><p><b>"Y</b>ou've gotta be kidding me..."  Ranma breathed incredulously. She wasn't sure what half of that meant, but the  word "goddess' was more than enough.</p><p>"A GODDESS?"  Nodoka blurted suddenly. "He can't be a Goddess! He's a manly man!  He's..."</p><p>"..Got an  engagement!" Soun Tendo joined in. "The two houses must be joined and  he WILL marry my Akane!"</p><p>"I do NOT want to  marry that PERVERT!" Akane exploded as the obligations of her parent's  life crashed down on her.</p><p>"DAMN YOU,  RANMA!" Ryoga chimed. "Why are you always breaking sweet Akane's  heart?"</p><p>"What about your  obligations, boy! Be a man!" his father balked.</p><p>Ranma's head pounded. And  pounded. The arguments continued as he was verbally tugged between parties, the  Goddesses watching with a mixture of amazement and horror as chaos erupted at  the dinner table. The pressure continued to mount on the redhead, who already  had way too many of her own problems to deal with. And when she couldn't take  it any more ...She disappeared.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was a  beautiful night, she realized, sucking in the cool evening air. Ranma breathed  a silent thank you when she found herself suddenly on the roof, looking at the  stars as if magically transported there. On second thought, she was sure that  was EXACTLY what had happened. That silent prayer also gave thanks to the fact  that all but the loudest arguing was absorbed by the house. She closed her eyes  in peace. Then opened them again to find Belldandy hovering near the ledge,  worry evident on her face. Ranma produced a warm smile that silently invited  the goddess to stay.<p>She floated over and knelt  next to the resting woman who looked very much like a goddess at the moment. "We  are very sorry for the mistake ...And that," she indicated the commotion  down stairs.</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "THAT  is not your fault," she corrected. "What you saw down there happens  nearly every day to one degree or another. Don't get too close or you might get  sucked into my chaotic life as well."</p><p>It was Belldandy's turn to  chuckle. "I think it's too late for that warning."</p><p>"How did you find me  so quickly anyway...?" Ranma wondered aloud, then silently wish she hadn't  stuck a foot in his mouth. She's a goddess, duh.</p><p>"Kasumi told  me," Belldandy winked. "And made me promise not to tell anybody  else."</p><p>"Good, because then  I'd have to find a new hiding spot." she retorted with humor.</p><p>Belldandy grew serious for  a moment. "Is you life really like that all the time?"</p><p>Ranma snorted and rolled  over to face her. "More so on average." Belldandy's eyes widened.  "If you don't mind a tale of comedy and tragedy, I could use somebody to  talk to right about now."</p><p>And so Belldandy listened  to how Ranma Saotome had been set on his martial arts destiny at age five, sold  for some rice and two pickles, wrapped in fish sausage and tossed into a pit of  starving cats. But that had only been the beginning. There was China.  Jyusenkyou. A certain curse. More training. Homicidal Amazon warriors. The  forced engagement to Akane. The engagement to said homicidal Amazon. The  engagement to a childhood friend. Being chased by Love struck Kodachi. Having  to be on continual vigil for no less than four alienated suitors who despised  him for the multiple engagements, the continuing congo line of villains,  finally ending with Saffron. Belldandy rested a hand on the girl's shoulder to  comfort her as the tale came forth and Ranma's emotions swung from anger to  misery, finally stabilizing in determined resignation.</p><p>Even as she finished, a  sobering realization came to Ranma. "I killed a god." Belldandy  nodded noncommittally. "You and your sisters are goddesses." Again,  Belldandy simply nodded. Ranma sighed once again. "I'm in big trouble, aren't  I?"</p><p>Belldandy smiled easily.  "Not exactly... He will be reborn. I can't give you all the details, but  lets just say you've helped some very important people out in that-"</p><p>Skuld hopped up onto the  roof, interrupting Belldandy's explanation. "Well, we have a minor problem."  She called her terminal into existence, causing Ranma to arch an eyebrow. Neat  trick. "We've tried to revert Ranma to a mortal but can't."</p><p>Belldandy asked the  obvious question before Ranma could. "Why not?"</p><p>"We're locked  out!" Skuld huffed. "The only reason we were able to change her file  in the first place was because we were in recovery mode and the data was  corrupted beyond belief. Now that the file is intact and recognized by the  Yggradsil, it's safeguarded against tampering; especially tampering that would  change a person from deity to mortal. That's high level stuff right  there."</p><p>"So what can we do  for Ranma?"</p><p>Skuld thought for a  moment. "The only way I know to bypass that lock is to hard-copy HR and  get all of the department heads to sign off on it. Once Heavenly Resources ok's  the request, it's forwarded to -gulp- Kami-sama for final approval." The  girl paled with that last bit.</p><p>Belldandy nodded  thoughtfully. "That will take a few days..." Skuld nodded in  agreement. "Well, Ranma, it looks like you'll have to stay a goddess for a  bit longer," amusement evident in her voice</p><p>Ranma smiled grimly,  remembering the old saw that had helped her remain sane over the years. It  could be worse. I could be stuck as a duck, piglet or kitten...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>With the  primary source of conflict removed from the scene, the arguments downstairs  dwindled and died. And for those that refused to dwindle and die, there was  Urd, who promptly caused them to pass out once she tired of their relentless  prattle. The body count was at three now, consisting of Ryoga, Soun and Genma.  Akane had enough sense to stomp up stairs before the goddess singled her out,  while everybody else just tired of the scene. Besides Kasumi picking up the  dishes, Urd was left alone with her thoughts.<p>Not a Goddess. Whatsoever.  Urd thought it was impossible, but Bell-chan rarely asserted herself in such a  manner. She was certain, which meant Ranma was what she was: Mortal. That still  didn't change the fact that she knew Ranma from somewhere. Absolutely and without  a shadow of doubt. And the fact that she's taken out a God... The entire  situation bordered on insanity and Ranma was taking it surprisingly well. Of  course, if tonight was any indication as to the rest of her life, she might  have built up a healthy immunity to insane situations. But they had screwed up.  Royally. Skuld and I have just pushed a mortal to one-one unlimited without  approval or preparation, she thought morbidly. And now they have to submit the  reversal through HR and ultimately Kami-sama. I'll be lucky to hold Class Three  Apprentice at this rate. Urd downed the glass of sake Kasumi had so kindly set  out for her earlier.</p><p>Belldandy, Skuld and Ranma  made their way into the living room where Urd was drinking it up, Belldandy  instantly offering her new friend Kasumi to help with the remaining dishes  while Skuld simply yawned, plopping sleepily into a soft chair. Urd was  steadily avoiding eye contact with the redhead until a hand rested lightly on  her shoulder. She looked up into those azure eyes and a smile.</p><p>"Aw, don't worry  about it," Ranma reassured the seldom guilt ridden goddess. "This  happens all the time."</p><p>She succeeded in putting a  dent in Urd's depression. "Being changed into a goddess or the random  chaos?"</p><p>"Mostly the  chaos," Ranma smirked. " Though I have to admit that this is the  first time I've been a goddess."</p><p>Urd laughed openly this  time. Her life was about starting to sound like mine, she thought. Some days  she couldn't beat the chaos off with a stick, truth be told. "So what do  you think of your test drive?"</p><p>"Honestly?"  Ranma asked, Urd nodding. "I'm scared... I've been purposely holding back  some elements of the change because I just don't know enough... I'm scared I  won't be "me" anymore... As if being 100 girl isn't unnerving  enough."</p><p>The bronze goddess tilted  her head. "100 girl?" Ranma explained the Jyusenkyou curse. Urd  siged. "Yeah, that's our fault too. When we synchronized your file to your  body, it must have found you as a female and locked you in as one once the update  occurred. The curse information <i>might</i> be somewhere in the your bio  still, but it's been superceded ...For now at least."</p><p>Ranma didn't like the fact  that Urd was sinking back into her depression. She liked her, just like she was  fond of Belldandy and Skuld in such a short period of time. They had accepted  him... and her, for what she was as if it happened every day. Ranma retrieved  the bottle of sake from the cupboard and slapped a glass on the table for the  goddess, breaking her mood abruptly. "It's only a minor inconvenience  after what I've been through!" Urd smiled broadly at the cheerful  redhead's enthusiasm. "And woe be anybody who blames you for saving my  file from certain doom!"</p><p>With that, two unlikely  friends laughed together through the night, trading stories of misfortune and  chaos over sake.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sunlight  pounded away at Ranma's retinas as the first rays of morning light found her  blinking eyes. Ooooh, my head, she thought, struggling to sit upright. Somehow  she had managed to stagger up to her room last night, despite the influence of  several glasses of sake. While her tolerance hadn't been too high to begin  with, boy could that Urd pack it away! No excuse to miss practice, she amended,  sliding out of her goddess attire and into a traditional red Chinese shirt and  black pants without paying any mind to her lengthened pony tail and facial  marks. Downstairs, nobody else was awake, save Kasumi, who was already getting  the kitchen around. Ranma stopped in, helped her scramble a few eggs and set  the table before continuing on to the dojo for practice. She slid the door open  and was only a step in before a massive object blew by her head, striking the  ground in front of her with considerable force. Ranma was wide awake now as she  stared at the high tech mallet and it's owner.<p>"EEK! AkAN- er,  SKULD?"</p><p>Skuld lept back, plainly  horrified. "<i>I'mSorryI'mSorryI'mSorryI'mSorryI'mSorryI'mSorry!</i>"  she pleaded and begged for forgiveness, grovling on the dojo mat.  "  I'mreallyreallysorry!"</p><p>Ranma sighed and pulled  the tearful girl up. The she did something very unRanma-like. She gave her a  little kiss on the forehead and wiped away the young goddesses tears with a  finger and a smile. "Accidents happen, right? Don't give it another  thought."</p><p>Skuld blinked away further  tears with difficulty. "Y-Y-You're sure it's Ok?"</p><p>Ranma picked up her mallet  and handed it back to the girl. "No problem at all, but your swing could  use a bit of work!"</p><p>That was all it took to  banish the last vestiges of guilt from the girl. "It.. It does?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "You've  got considerable power there, but you need to learn control." Ranma took  the hammer from Skuld, who willingly gave it away. "Since your center of  gravity is all the way at the block, you're going to want to use the power you  put into it as efficiently as possible... Watch."</p><p>Skuld watched as the  temporary Goddess of Luck took to the mat and gave the hammer a mighty swing.  The arc was perfect and it cracked the floor hard before rebounding back  skyward on it's own energy. The younger goddess gasped, and Ranma pulled the  hammer into a tight horizontal arc, spinning it from hand to hand and then  around her waist. She took several light steps to the left, allowing the hammer  to extend fully out before using her bodyweight to pull it back in and shift it  in another direct, cracking it to the floor once more. Skuld gaped, intent on  the motion. Ranma just wasn't practicing, she realized with a start. Each  movement was connecting with an invisible target, whether in the air or on the  ground! It was amazing! Ranma's ponytail flipped around gracefully as she  changed positions, allowing the neck of the hammer to be her striking implement  for the next few arcs, combining the movement with several foot combinations  before reversing the hammer back. Looping the hammer skyward, she used its  momentum to help carry her jump higher before bringing the hammer down in  successive strikes, touching the ground herself only seconds later. Ranma recovered  from the position gracefully and walk back to the mat's edge.</p><p>Skuld was barely in any  condition to receive her own hammer back as she simply stared at Ranma in awe.  "S-s-s-sugoi!"</p><p>"Like that did  ya?" Ranma asked, smile creeping across her face. Skuld could only nod  yes. "Well, I normally don't do this, but if you want somebody to  pr-"</p><p>"YES!" Skuld  beamed with excitement, not even letting the redhead finish. "I DO I DO I  DO I DO!"</p><p>"Ok, ok!" Ranma  scruffed the teen's hair. "I'm not saying it will be easy and you've got  some work ahead of you... Think you can handle it?"</p><p>Skuld nodded vigorously  and tackled Ranma with a crushing hug. "THANKYOU ONEE-CHAN!"</p><p>With that, Ranma watched  the Goddess of the Future bounce out the door in excitement, eager to share her  good fortune with the world. Why not, Ranma thought. Besides, it will keep me  bus-</p><p>"Wait... Did she just  say 'Onee-chan'?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The  household gathered around the table for breakfast, the wrongs of last night  nearly washed away for a new day. As the first dishes were served by Kasumi and  Belldandy, Urd noticed her little sister sitting next to Ranma and beaming with  pride.<p>Urd had to know.  "What's up with you, Squirt?"</p><p>The 'squirt' part went  completely unnoticed. "Onee-chan is going to teach me how to use my  hammer!"</p><p>"onee-chan? Hammer?  Ranma?"</p><p>Skuld nodded excitedly.</p><p>"Onee-chan!"  half the table asked simultaneously in disbelief.</p><p>Ranma produced a weak  smile and shrugged. The Onee-chan part wasn't her idea, and she just didn't  have the heart to tell the kid otherwise, but the hammer... "Yeah, she has  some potential with that hammer... I only offered to help polish her  technique."</p><p>Urd thought on the matter  for a moment. Her little sister would be hard pressed to find anyone better  after yesterday's display, she realized, and it would give her something  constructive to do besides build those bothersome little machines that  invariably turn my life upside-down. She cracked a grin. "Just don't break  her during practice... Ran-chan!"</p><p>Belldandy smiled through  the exchange. Could Ranma possibly be the unifying force between the two polar  opposites that are my sisters? She wondered in amazement. As unlikely as it  seemed, she had heard the ruckus Ranma and Urd had caused last night and now  Skuld was absolutely stuck on her as well. Perhaps this trip wasn't going to be  all bad news after all.</p><p>Unfortunately, not  everybody at the table saw things her way.</p><p>"Your going to teach  her WHAT!" Akane turned a withering gaze upon Ranma, who winced. This time  it had nothing to do with a potential fiancée, but pride. Ranma had offered to  help her exactly one time and that session had ended in feud. And now to rub  salt on that wound, he was going to teach this little brat!</p><p>Akane was just about to  lay into him once more, but missed a crucial development in their argument  dynamic- Ranma now had allies.</p><p>"LISTEN YOU BAKA,  I-"</p><p>"Don't get mad at my  Onee-chan!" Skuld leaned across the table in Ranma's defense, radiating  intensity. "She was just being nice!"</p><p>"Well he's MY  fiancée!" Akane leaned over the table, escalating the situation.</p><p>"Then MAYBE you  should start TREATING her like one!" Urd forced a cup of juice down onto  the table hard and stopped Akane cold.</p><p>"Yeah!" Skuld  chimed in, rounding off the proclamation.</p><p>Akane pulled back in  shock. The table was silent. In an instant, the entire focus of the argument  had shifted from Ranma being a thoughtless cad to her being a cranky witch, and  for the first time since her introduction to Ranma, Akane found herself on  unfamiliar debating ground.</p><p>Nabiki, who had started to  pull back from the table to avoid the routine escalation and property damage,  decided to stay out of sheer curiosity. Ranma Saotome, who would never attempt  to defend himself from his first given fiancée had somehow found people to  champion him against Akane's verbal abuse. You just don't make friends like  that overnight unless she'd underestimated Ranma in some critical way. The  biggest surprise, however, came from Kasumi. Nabiki would have probably missed  it entirely if not for a casual glance over to her sister, but there on her  face was the impossible- A nearly invisible smile trying desperately to look  like a mask of concern. Nabiki blinked and it was gone, submerged entirely from  view beneath that carefully constructed facade. Apparently Ranma wasn't the  only one she'd been underestimating.</p><p>In that time, Akane had  managed to recover at least some of her wits, at least enough to not risk  angering Ranma's support any further. With a final "BAKA!" Akane was  up from the table and out of the dining room. Even as she crossed the living  room threshold, a sobering thought hit her: She had just gotten done arguing  with <i>goddesses</i>. She turned back to the dining room to find the glare of  Skuld and Urd still on her. And now she was on their <i>bad</i> side. Akane's  remaining anger evaporated abruptly, deciding some dojo practice was in order  to clear her head. Ryoga decided to quickly join her before he said anything  that would cause Urd to put him to sleep again.</p><p>Nabiki caught Kasumii in  the kitchen as she was fetching more milk, cornering her. "How long have  you...?"</p><p>"...Known that Ranma  was more than an insensitive womanizing jerk?" Kasumi finished. Nabiki  nodded in mild surprise. "Oh, for quite some time now."</p><p>"But he's just a  martial arts jock..." Nabiki stated certainly. Or was that hopefully now?</p><p>"Maybe." Kasumi  shrugged, slipping by her sister with milk in hand. "But guess who helped  fix your breakfast this morning?"</p><p>The look of total surprise  on her sister's face was priceless.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The four  had moved out into the courtyard for some fresh air, and Ranma abruptly  apologized to the three sisters. "I should have seen that coming..."<p>"Hmmf." Urd  grumbled. "SHE'S the one who had it coming. And for a long time by the  sound of things."</p><p>"She's a meanie,  Onee-chan! How can you be engaged to marry HER?" Skuld ask bluntly, a huge  sweat drop forming down the side of Ranma's head.</p><p>"It's not always bad  like that..." Ranma stated weakly.</p><p>"But do the good  times outweigh the bad times?" Urd pressed her. Ranma remained silent.  "Then she'd better get her act together before someone snaps you up!"  Ranma tripped face first into the ground, but Urd wasn't done. "In fact, I  can help you with that minor little detail, Ran-chan! We'll get you a real  hottie! I am, after all, the Goddess of <i>Looooove!</i>"</p><p>"Urd, what has  Kami-sama told you about the potions...?" Belldandy asked the rhetorical  question. After hearing Ranma's story last night, something told her that the  last thing she'd want would be another entanglement.</p><p>"Party pooper!"</p><p>Ranma decided a tactical  change of subject was in order. "So, what do beautiful Goddesses such as  ourselves do for fun?" 'such as ourselves!' Ranma mentally chaste himself.  Where in the world did that come from?</p><p>At that very moment, the  sputtering of a motorbike found it's way to the front entrance of the Tendo  courtyard. Belldandy smiled with delight and answered, "They give Keiichi  a kiss!" Urd rolled her eyes.</p><p>Ranma noted that the boy  who got off the bike was about slightly older than Ranma and nearly her  girl-type's height. He was also presumably Keiichi, since he was the one to  receive Belldany's kiss. They made a cute couple, Ranma thought with a mixture  of bitter happiness. Ranma's further observations were cut short by Urd's  scheming.</p><p>"I've been working on  those two for a while now..." She whispered conspiratorially. "I've  almost got them to the point where they can share the same bed without Kei-chan  freezing up!"</p><p>Ranma simply shook her  head. That was just too much information. Thankfully, Skuld saved him from any  further love schemes by dragging her over to the couple.</p><p>"Keiichi, meet  Ranma!" Keiichi shook her hand lightly, as he would have a girl. Which she  currently was. Obviously he didn't get the memo, Ranma thought, mildly amused.</p><p>She decided to throw him a  curve ball just for kicks and grins. "Temporary Goddess of Luck First  class at your service!"</p><p>Keiichi's eyes popped open  in surprise, but he recovered nicely. "Very nice to meet you, Ranma, but  I'm topped off on goddesses for the moment."</p><p>"Forgive me then if I  don't take Bell-chan up on her offer to kiss you." Ranma deadpanned, but  Keiichi was already onto her, chuckling in amusement while the cutest blush  glowed across Belldandy's face. It would have all been so carefree if she  hadn't noticed Nabiki stalk into the Dojo, a place she normally avoided like  the plague. Scheming, scheming everywhere.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Inside,  Nabiki found Akane cracking cinder blocks and taking names. And she was nearly  out of cinder blocks. Nabiki knocked on the doorframe and let herself in,  catching her younger sisters attention. "We need to talk."<p>Akane wiped the sweat from  her forehead. "How much is it going to cost?"</p><p>"Consider this one  your freebie for the week." Nabiki replied and cut strait to the chase.  "You're losing him."</p><p>An uncomfortable silence  ensued.</p><p>"So?" Akane  brushed the fact aside, attempting to stonewall her sister. "Why should I  care what that Casanova or his fiancées do?"</p><p>"Because you're not  losing to him as a fiancée this time," Nabiki corrected her. "You're  losing as a <i>friend</i>, and in some ways, that's considerably worse."</p><p>"But I..."</p><p>Nabiki cut her short.  "No butts. He's making friends who don't seem to care about his curse and  don't let it get in the way of their friendship. I suspect that when YOUR  friendship is measured against that, every single problem you and he face  becomes that much more. It then becomes a simple matter of whose opinion counts  more- Yours or theirs."</p><p>Akane took another breath  to speak, but Nabiki held up her finger in silence once more. "Frankly, I  don't care what you do with Saotome, or how you're going to do it if she's  remains a girl." Nabiki revised quickly. "But you're my sister and I  don't want to see you hurt. This is your fair warning wake-up call."</p><p>Even as she turned to  leave Akane to her thoughts, Nabiki add one last thing. The bombshell. "If  you decide to pursue him, I'll help you wherever I can, but if Kasumi steps in  to claim him, all bets are off."</p><p>Akane's head jerked upright  in shock. "K-Kasumi!"</p><p>"Who do you think  helped her make breakfast this morning?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The four  goddesses and Keiichi were having a wonderful time as Ranma led through the  bustling Nerima market district, showing them what little sights there were. It  presented a problem for her, really. She was trying to entertain <i>goddesses</i>  after all, and Nerima wasn't exactly a metropolis. Aside from a few other  locations and his school, which was currently dead because it was Sunday, Ranma  was rapidly running out of places to entertain his guests. And that's when it  hit her.<p>"I need a  donut."</p><p>The entire group stopped  in front of produce store, not sure if they had heard the young red head  correctly.</p><p>Skuld blinked. "Did  you say..."</p><p>"Infact, I need a <i>box</i>  of donuts." She didn't have an honest to God clue <i>why</i> she was  craving donuts so suddenly, but Ranma needed donuts and she needed them <i>now</i>.  "Jeez, I sound like Skuld and her ice cream..."</p><p>For Belldandy and Urd, the  reason for the craving snapped into place instantly on hearing that. "That  would figure," Urd reasoned with her sister. "She's been a Goddess  for about 48 hours now, been involved in one battle and tons of stress... Of  course she needs a donut."</p><p>Belldandy happily filled  Ranma in on the missing details. "As goddesses, we each have our own  unique energy sources. Mine, for example is sleep</p>sugoi<p>. Urd craves sake as hers and  Skuld..."</p><p>"...loves  icecream." Ranma finished, winking at the kid who was glowing with delight  at the mere mention of the frozen treat.</p><p>It was at that moment  Keiichi's stomach grumbled loud enough for the group to hear, and Belldandy  felt a sudden pang of guilt. "Oh Kei-chan! I wasn't there to fix you  breakfast this morning!"</p><p>Keiichi was trying to  downplay the fact to his fiancee when Ranma had a wonderful idea. "Raman  or Okanomiyaki?" Actually, now that he thought about it, that probably  wasn't one of her better ideas after all... Both locations just happened to be  fiancée free fire zones. Behind door number one: A smothering uninhibited Amazon  warrior and her manipulative grandmother, while behind door number two: An  alienated childhood best friend turned fiancée. Man, I SO need a donut now.</p><p>"We haven't had  Okanomiyaki in a while..." Keiichi mused, and Ranma silently praised the  Lord. Of the two choices she had presented, Ucchan's probably held the least  chance of exploding in her face.</p><p>A box of donuts and 10  minutes later found them stepping inside Ukyo's Okanomiyaki restaurant, the  owner of which instantly recognizing <i>her</i> fiancé.</p><p>Ukyo was around the counter  in a flash, pulling Ranma into a hug. "Ranma honey! Good to see you! What  would you like me to..." Then she noticed the box of donuts. "...Fix  you?" That caused her to take in Ranma as a whole. Overall, the goddesses  had been running stealthed, walking around Nerima in everyday attire and no  marks on their faces as not to attract undue attention, but Ukyo knew her  fiancé and knew him well. First she was a girl and not wet. Second, she seemed  to glow invisibly and in an indescribable manner. Third, her pigtail was no  longer a pigtail, but a full-length ponytail braided in gold. Finally, there  were his guests. Three more women ages 15-19, each with a similar aura and one  guy, obviously the oldests' boyfriend given the way they were attached at the  hip. Ranma bringing in guests was odd enough. Ranma bringing in people who were  obviously <i>friends</i> was a notable event in itself.</p><p>"Care to introduce me  to your <i>friends</i>?"</p><p>Ranma noted the emphasis  and smiled. Of all the fiancées vying for his attention, Ukyo was probably the  sharpest, and her new friends most likely weren't the only observation she  made. "Let me introduce sisters Belldandy, Urd and Skuld. This is  Belldandy's fiancé, Keiichi. "Everybody, this is Ukyo Kuonji, Okanomiyaki  master!"</p><p>Ukyo blushed madly at the  compliment but noted with a pang of remorse that the descriptive  "fiancée" was nowhere to be found for her. Still she was relatively  sure neither the striking tanned women or the younger teen weren't in that  category either. Even though it still cut, it was somewhat comforting to know  that the thought of playing around behind her back hadn't even crossed Ranma's  mind. He was just too honorable for that, and she was sure when the time came,  everybody would receive fair and equal notice as to who had finally won his  heart.</p><p>Everybody settled around  the counter and Ukyo began grilling their lunch with ease, it's aroma wafting  across their noses. Even as she flipped an Okanomiyaki, curiosity was eating  her alive. She could ask him point blank why he was still a girl, but she had  more tact than that and he probably had a good reason. Granted, she still  wanted to know what that reason was, but she decided on a more subtle approach.  "The braiding is beautiful! You decided to grow it out?"</p><p>Ranma could see the real  question in her eyes and appreciated the fact that she was giving her a way out  of what would undoubtedly be a sticky explanation while maintaining his  confidence. For this particular fiancée, however, there was no need for  subterfuge. "It's a long story, but the long and short of it means that I  can't change back for the time being."</p><p>I might just have to take  a break and hear this story, Ukyo thought. His friends hadn't even raised an  eyebrow at the ambiguous concept of "changing back", which meant they  knew all the details of Ranma's curse. And they were still his ungrudging  friends; something Ranma had darn few of in her opinion. She finished the  groups' dishes and handed her spatula off to Konatsu, sitting beside Ranma.  "Ok, Ran-chan, spill it."</p><p>"Alright, Ucchan, but  you ain't gonna believe this one..."</p><p>In another time and  another place, those two would have made an excellent couple, Urd noted as  Ranma shared the story with his childhood friend. Still might if the girl plays  her cards right. Urd fought down the urge to proceed with some divine  intervention concerning the two. It was tough, but she had gotten Belldandy's  earlier rebuke loud and clear. Four fiancées and a slew of jealous suitors  combined with the normal chaos in Ranma's life that all but mirrored her own  was enough to make ANYBODY walk on eggshells. The dynamics of her relationships  alone were enough to make my head... hurt?</p><p>Oh no. A memory crept out  of the darkness and to the forefront of Urd's mind and it suddenly became  clear. She looked at the redhead again. It WAS her! Horror slowly consumed her.  Kami-sama, I swear I had no idea...!</p><p>With that last thought,  Urd bolted upright out of her seat, bringing a halt to all conversation.  "Uh, I have to go... To check on something. Don't wait up!" And with  that, Urd was gone.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Author's  Notes</b><p><b><i>T</i></b><i>his is the first fanfic I've  written in a while, so I hope you enjoyed it so far. I've decided to divide the  'book' into three chapter segments for easier reading.</i></p><p><b>About Special moves;</b><br/><i>Once or twice saying something like "Kachu Tenshin Amagurican" is  fine for dramatic effect, but after that, I'm simplifying it to the English  versions in most cases as not to overly disrupt the flow of the story.  Likewise, I'm not going to say mushi-mushi every time somebody picks up a  phone. Of course, "Flying Dragon Ascend to Heaven strike" just sounds  silly, so there are always exceptions.</i></p><p><b>About Ryoga;</b><br/><i>Since the timeline is after Jusendo and Saffron, it's assumed he's hooked up  with Akari Unryu (end series love interest). I would also assume that his  protectiveness for Akane just wouldn't die away, nor his suspicions of  Saotome's worth concerning her, thus the continued friction between the two. I  consider him Akane's big overprotective brother' now.</i></p><p><b>About Skuld;</b><br/><i>It's kind of tough marrying the two timelines, especially when OMG seems to  have deeper character development than Ranma ½ in my opinion (not that I don't  love them both). Case and point, Skuld has developed from a brat to a teen a  sense of responsibility where Ranma characters remain pretty static in nature  from beginning to end. Even the OMG visual style continues to evolve. Given  this disparity, I type-casted her somewhere in between- as the young,  impressionable teen genius smitten with Ranma.</i></p><p><b>About Urd; </b><br/><i>I've always gotten the impression that she's a person with plenty of  acquaintances, few friends and even fewer good friends, the latter she's very  possessive of. The fact that Ranma And Urd both have 'take crap from nobody'  attitude and lead chaotic lives seems like the perfect match for two people to  just "click" with one another. I'll develop this further in 4-6.</i></p><p><b>About Ranma; </b><br/><i>Why is he a girl? Why can't he change? Well, besides the obvious answers  (ie; "just because"), I wanted to detail the effects on his psyche,  his mind dealing with real gender change, new power and a balance between all  the different directions he's being pulled, from internally to his fiancées.  I've left the back door in there to add the curse later, but playing with his  and fiancées minds is so much fun I don't know if I'll use it.</i></p><p><b>About Kasumi; </b><br/><i>I've always liked the idea that there is actually a powerful thought process  hiding underneath her domestic demeanor. No special reason for this, just  artistic license.</i></p><p><b>Thanks;</b><br/>To Ián B for proof reading and catching some of my more obvious errors.</p><p><i>Miscellaneous stuff</i>- Neither Ranma ½ nor Oh My  Goddess are my creations. They are the owned by their repective artitists and  publishers. I'm simply taking their ideas and plot and combining them into a  comedic/dramatic mash. All text therein, however, is the sole property of  Ozzallos, but may be freely distributed as long as it is done so without  alteration.</p><p>Finally, special thanks to  all noted in Part 3, Chapters 7-9</p>
