</div><p><b>Oh  My Ranma ½!<br/>No  Need for Wishes!<br/></b>By: Ozzallos</p><p><b>Part V<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Forward:</b> <i>The Tenchi universe has  no less than three alternate timelines to choose from, so be advised  I'm going to play fast and loose with all of them from here on out.  Don't expect strict adherence to any one since you can't make  everybody happy all the time. I'll make every attempt to keep the  core plot surrounding Tenchi intact, however. Don't forget the encrypted preview! ;)<hr noshade="" size="1"/></i></p><p><b>Chapter 4</b></p><p>Ranma popped out of the  lake with ease and floated lightly onto the property of the Masaki  shrine. It really was a beautifully place, she decided. Secluded on a  nice hillside with the house and lake below, surrounded by forest.  You could get used to it, she thought agreeably and poked her head  into one of the structures.</p><p>"Anybody home?"</p><p>Tenchi Masaki scampered  across the wooden floor he had been sweeping with a small start, but  recovered his wits when he recognized Ranma. The student gave the  floor another swipe and wiped the sweat from his brow. He noticed she  was in her casual Chinese attire and Tenchi smiled at the Goddess as  she stepped closer.</p><p>"So what's up,  Tenchi?"</p><p>"I don't think that  wish thing worked. Not that I need it, I guess," He added hastily,  "But it would be a shame after all the trouble I put you through."</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Well  that's why I'm here. To make sure it <i>does</i> work." …And  that you don't get abducted by aliens or something, she amended as  an afterthought.</p><p>"Really?" Tenchi  seemed taken back. "I mean, I don't want to keep you from  something important, you know."</p><p>Well I'd love to do  that, she thought sarcastically, but you had to go and wish that  stupid— She stopped that train of thought short and began to examine  her attitude very carefully.</p><p>This <i>was</i> her job.  Granting wishes. It <i>was</i> important. A matter of <i>honor </i>even,  if she wanted to put it into a martial arts context. Maybe things  hadn't turned out the way she would like them to, but it was still  her job to make sure it turned out right. Quit yer whining Ranma, she  rebuked herself. You knew full well what you were getting into when  you signed on the dotted line with Kami-sama. This was the sacrifice  He was talking about. This was the servant's duty Urd had  explained. If you can't perform these duties with the same honor as  The Art, you probably shouldn't be teaching it either!</p><p>Mentally redressed, Ranma  favored Tenchi with her trademark roguish grin.</p><p>"Hey, don't worry  'bout it. I'll just stick around here with you and see what we  can dig up, kay?" …And <i>still</i> make sure you don't get  abducted my space aliens, she smiled quietly. Tenchi nodded with  enthusiasm. "So where's your grandfather, anyway?"</p><p>"Probably on the other  side of the lake…" Tenchi replied, setting aside the broom. Even  as he finished, the mischievous gleam of realization gleamed in his  eyes. "And that means now's my chance!" Ranma looked at him  curiously as he ran over to the desk and began rifling through its  contents.</p><p>Ranma bent over beside  him as he flipped through another folder. "Whatcha looking for?"</p><p>He paused momentarily.  "Keys. I'm going to finally see what we've been keeping in that  old shrine."</p><p>"And what's supposed  to be in there?"</p><p>"A demon slaying  blade!" Tenchi replied, pulling open another drawer. "Gramps  keeps going on about this old legend about how an ancient warrior  named Yosho defeated a demon that could destroy mountains with the  thing."</p><p>The Goddess of Luck  watched him hurry through his search and weighed her options. She  could either sit around and watch him do chores all day, waiting for  some alien to come along and marry him <i>or</i>… She smiled  mischievously. "What do ya need a key for?" Tenchi paused in his  search. "I <i>am</i> a Goddess after all."</p><p>Tenchi's eyes widened  momentarily before the implication set it "Alright! Let's go  then!" Tenchi quickly abandoned his chores and the two vacated the  room with haste.</p><p>Less than ten minutes  later Katsuhito Masaki stood in the doorway of the empty room,  finding his charge noticeably absent from his duties. He stroked his  bearded gray chin, absently wondering where he had ran off to. The  grandfather knew it wouldn't be the temple since he had the keys,  so Tenchi was probably off taking a break somewhere. Suspicions  mollified for the moment, Katsuhito went to kitchen to grab a snack.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma watched Tenchi yank  the sword out of the ancient shrine with some curiosity. Masaki flipped  it around to test its balance, both examined it carefully. Definitely not a katana,  Ranma decided. The strait lines of the scabbard and the oddly  designed hilt were evidence enough of that. While the Anything Goes  School didn't necessarily emphasis the use of edged weaponry, it  didn't neglect it either. The student growled with strain as he  attempted to pull the scabbard free. Wasn't Chinese either, she  realized. Infact, the entire hilt design was much too exotic to  be—The blade finally snapped free and in Tenchi's hands rested  the weapon that once slew mighty demons. Both teens frowned.<p>"Your sword's a piece  of junk, Tenchi." The dejected Goddess commented upon seeing the  rust eaten stick of metal that was once a blade.</p><p>Tenchi wasn't exactly  happy either. "Give me a break… This thing is supposed to cut  through rock?" He gave it a careless slice and shattered the  ancient blade across one of the warding stones, which promptly split  clean in two. Ranma only had a moment to be surprised when a small  pebble bounced off her head and the entire cave began to rumble. She  looked up in time to find a huge boulder in freefall. A quick  sidestep saw the stone imbed itself into the earth beside her and she  twitched visibly at the thought of becoming a Saotome pancake.</p><p>Tenchi abandoned the  stone he was attempting to piece back together just as the boulder  slammed home. Both looked at one another, then the now broken sword  in his hand. A light breeze brushed by them and Ranma's brush with  death was forgotten as they sought the source, a wide fissure in the  far cave wall that definitely hadn't been there before. The redhead  shrugged and Tenchi squeezed through, Ranma following close behind.  The only illumination came from a shaft of light that had somehow  managed to piece the cave's ceiling, but it wasn't enough to see  the standing water the boy promptly stepped in. Or the stalactite  that jumped in front of his forehead. Or the slippery section of the  finely machined incline he now tried to stand upright on, with little  success. The hilt of the ruined sword clattered into the pit as he  flailed wildly to maintain his balance, grabbing on to the first  object within reach.</p><p>Unfortunately that just  happened to be Ranma's arm and the two hit the ground, sliding  wildly down the dark shaft where they were deposited a hundred feet  later in a most compromising position. It would have been a great  position had they been lovers. Urd would have approved. Maybe even  watched. Tenchi covered the redhead like a blanket and there was no  body part not left touching one another. The pair's eyes were  locked on to one another as both faces began to progress through  multiple shades of pink. Tenchi, being the passive sort simply laid  their in shock on top of her while Ranma was still trying to decide  exactly why she was letting him do so. The Boy part of her psyche  voted to snap his neck. The girl, Ranma noted with some surprise was  a bit of a hentai. She voted in favor of pulling the handsome student  into something more than just a kiss. The goddess winced and  ruthlessly suppressed her before settling for something diplomatic,  yet to the point.</p><p>"Get off me before I  snap yer neck."</p><p>Tenchi's eyes widened  and somehow instantly teleported himself to a standing position  against the stone wall. If it hadn't been for the ambient lighting,  his red face would have lit the small cavern with its own glow. The  embarrassment was short lived as he found the source of the ambient  lighting; A pit in the center of the cavern. Student and Goddess  peered over the edge into the luminance body of water and the flesh  and bone remains therein.</p><p>"Is that…?" Ranma  stared down at the badly decomposed corpse that obviously wasn't  quite human.</p><p>"…The demon sealed by  my ancestors?" Tenchi wondered aloud, completing her thought. The  body barely broke the surface of the small crystalline reservoir. He  had recovered the hilt only to let it slip out of his hands as  another wave of surprise rippled through him. All this time and  grandfather's legends were… true? The artifact clattered to the  ground, startling both boy and girl out of their trances.</p><p>"Eep!" Ranma squeaked  as Tenchi flinched. She shot an accusing glare at her partner. "Don't  <i>do</i> that!" Sure, she had already been to hell and back during  her two month tenure as the Norn Goddess of Luck, but this entire  situation was just creepy. Good ol' Tenchi's ancestors have been  hiding corpses in weird looking underground catacombs that had aged  surprisingly well for being over seven hundred years old. Pretty  decent construction given the fact that they should have been working  with, oh, I dunno… Pick axes? That revelation alone set her mind on  another track entirely… His grandfather was an alien after all.  Would explain the weird angular groves in the impossibly smooth  tiling that made of the ground they now stood on. She leaned into the  pit a bit further for a better view as Tenchi bent over to retrieve  the exotic, if ruined sword. The thing reeked of power while the  demon didn't exactly <i>taste</i> like a demon in her mind.</p><p>The Goddesses coherent  thoughts were rudely interrupted when the corpse shuddered and <i>moved.</i>  Tenchi's hand locked around the hilt of the sword and a shriveled  hand locked around <i>his</i> wrist. He snatched his hand back only  to find the grip of iron yank back at him, and the demon slowly rose  from its watery tomb.</p><p>"Ack! Let go of me!"  the student protested in horror as monster drew him closer. Even as  the scene played out in front of her, part of Ranma rejoiced as she  once again found herself on familiar ground; that being kicking ass  and taking names. Aliens were still a bit of a gray area for her as  she only learned of their existence yesterday. Super villains and  demons however were pretty clear-cut. She knew exactly how to handle  <i>those. </i>The ball of super-charged energy forming in her hand  was preempted by a flash of light. Tenchi's souvenir glowed for a  brief moment and dumped raw power into his new friend, forcibly  separating both in a blinding flash of light. The boy landed on his  butt and quickly scampered to his feet while the demon drifted back  into the middle of its tomb, dazed and groaning. Its eyes glowed  brightly and that was it for Tenchi. He grabbed Ranma's hand on  reflex and ran back for the shaft, dragging her up the entire length.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Do you practice with  the blade, Goddess?" Katsuhito Masaki asked after he put Tenchi back  to work, apparently none the wiser of their little excursion. He  tossed her a bokken, which she whipped through the air to test its  balance.<p>"A little." Seemed  the old man wanted to spar. On any other day, she would have  dismissed him as over the hill, but this old man was an alien and she  could feel the power bubbling within if she probed deep enough.</p><p>"Then let's have a  little match, shall we?"</p><p>Ranma whipped the blade  around one more time before bringing it to an offensive strike  position in front of her. She also knew from her conversations with  Tenchi that he was a master, and truth be told, her skills with the  blade were getting a bit rusty. Kuno didn't exactly make for a  decent match, after all. The elder moved into his own stance  and now the Goddess was intrigued. It was one she had never seen  before and she resolved to pay very close attention to this  particular match.</p><p>She nodded and that was  all it took to set Kasuhito on the offensive. Ranma was barely able  to bring the bokken up in time to defect his first strike and she was  firmly on the defensive as he hammered away at her guard. Three  strikes later and she saw her opening, only to have her head nearly  taken off in a feint<i>. Damn, he's good!</i> Ranma brought the  blade up and desperately tried to retake the offense through a series  of aerial flips, bringing her own practice blade down hard overhead.  Deflected. She retained the momentum of that attack and continued to  probe his style, which seemed impenetrable. Even as her next probe  knifed in, she had a wicked idea. Ranma Saotome, Heir(ess) of the  Anything Goes School of Martial Arts and Goddess of Luck wasn't  called a martial arts prodigy for nothing, and Kasuhito Masaki was  about to find out exactly why. He continued to deflect her probes and  analyzed her style, storing tactics and preparing his counterattack  when he saw it—A hole in her offense. The master decided that was a  good place to start her lesson.</p><p>He took advantage of the  fault and instantly realized his mistake as his attack was deflected  away and Ranma's blade arced around in the same corkscrew maneuver  he himself had initiated only moments ago. Kasuhito countered before  the attack even came close, but the successful save did nothing to  lessen his shock. The girl had just devised and incorporated a Jurai  combat technique into her own style after witnessing its execution  merely once! With her trap failed, he watched as the goddess flipped  away to avoid the inevitable counterattack. He was about to press  that counterattack, but stopped short as she fell back into a  defensive guard. Even her stance was different now, showing hints of  its Jurai heritage. She didn't have enough to use it potently, but  the fact the fact that she was even trying was incredible. The  grandfather's hesitation broke, and he launched himself at the  girl, determined to show her the fullest measure of the Jurai art he  practiced.</p><p>She didn't last another  five minutes.</p><p>"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"  Ranma fumed, glaring at the old man. "You hit hard for an old guy!"</p><p>"You're holding  back." Katsuhito stated with a frown, looking down at his opponent.</p><p>Ranma stood back up and  tossed the blade back to Tenchi's grandfather. "Well, yeah and  no." She rubbed the knot on her head once more. "I could tap my  power, but that'd be cheatin'.'Cides, that's some technique  you got there."</p><p>Katsuhito nodded. "It  has been in our family for… generations." He seemed to smile  faintly at his own joke and Ranma smiled back in mischief.</p><p>"Yeah. It's kinda out  of this world."</p><p>The grandfather's  mental process stopped momentarily and suffered through a quick  reboot. Of course she would know. She's a Goddess of this planet  after all. Kind of short sighted of me for not realizing it before.  But he could give as good as he got.</p><p>"So how was your visit  to the cave?" He inquired casually.</p><p>"Jeez, you wouldn't  belie—" Ranma stopped suddenly, gazing on the elder with intent.  His mask remained one of placid neutrality. "I see. Sneaky old guy  too."</p><p>The elder took a  small bow. "I'll take that as a compliment from one such as  yourself." His tone grew serious. "You do realize he breached the  seal?"</p><p>Ranma sighed. "Yeah,  somehow I didn't think that vine knot job around the stone would  work." She looked at the grandfather and grinned. "Couldn't be  helped anyway." Katsuhito Masaki favored her a questioning look.  "I'm not sure how, but it has something to do with his wish. We  probably couldn't have stopped it even if we tried."</p><p>The elder considered the  Goddess in front of him a moment longer and began to chuckle.  "Somebody out of this world?"</p><p>She too chuckled at the  running joke. "Yep."</p><p>The chuckles rapidly grew  into full laughter. "Then let me tell you a little story about a  demon named Ryoko…"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Skuld tapped her foot  impatiently. She didn't need to consult a clock for the time as she  was getting a continuous feed from the Yggradsil, and it was telling  her one thing—Sensei was late. "You sure you haven't seen her,  A-chan?"<p>Akane finished the last  of her stretches and tightened her gi. "I don't think she came  home last night." She looked at Nabiki, wondering if she knew where  Ranma had wandered off to.</p><p>Nabiki saw the look and  shrugged. "Haven't seen her either.." Secretly, she couldn't  be more pleased. Now granted, the Goddess was the focus of her  affections as of late, but the brutal workout Ranma had put her  through yesterday was more than enough for her to hope for a day off.  Even as the middle Tendo began to count her blessings, the air around  the trio began to shudder with pressure.</p><p><i>Cr-Crack!</i></p><p>All three girls jumped at  the sound, light flashing around them. Skuld shook her head clear and  a smell tickled her nose. Ozone? They all turned and found the source  instantly. The center of the dojo now held a tallish boy in his late  teens. The bandanna and tiny fangs identified him instantly.</p><p>"Ryoga!" Akane  blurted with a smile. It was a shock to be sure, but a pleasant one  nonetheless.</p><p>Nabiki looked over the  lost boy curiously. "Did you just…?"</p><p>"My Personal  Dimensional Transporter!" Skuld's eyes widened, noticing the  bulky watch device on his wrist. "Where'd you get that?"</p><p>Ryoga scratched his head  sheepishly. "Um, Ranma gave it to me." Skuld scrutinized him for  a moment and shrugged, unable to discern any falsehood. "I guess I  should explain…"</p><p>"Yeah," Nabiki agreed  dryly. "Explain to us why you just appeared out of nowhere."</p><p>"Actually, Ranma asked  me to do a favor for him…"</p><p>"<i>Her</i>." Skuld  pointed out, sticking up for her sister.</p><p>"Er, right." Ryoga  amended, still adjusting to the new facts of life concerning Ranma.  <i>He</i> was now locked as a <i>she</i> and had been more than happy  to accept him as a friend. Even helped him with his directional  curse. And now this… "<i>She</i> already told you there might  occasions where her, um, <i>job</i> would keep her occupied at times,  right?" The girls nodded. "Well, Ranma was worried about her  ability to teach your classes properly."</p><p>"Meaning..?" Akane  asked.</p><p>"Meaning my name is  Ryoga Hibiki." He formally introduced himself with a lopsided grin.  "I'll be your instructor for the next few days."</p><p>The trio of girls  blinked. Skuld didn't mind, but then, she didn't have a clue.  Akane and Nabiki definitely had one, having witnessed the numerous  Ranma-Ryoga brawls over the last two and a half years first hand.  Both girls paled slightly. Akane loved Ryoga like a brother and all,  but this was Ranma's idea of a substitute! They were <i>so </i>dead.</p><p>"Boy, Saotome can sure  pick 'em…" Nabiki remarked with no small measure of depression  in her voice.</p><p>Ryoga turned to the  middle Tendo, an unpleasant smile creeping across his face. "Speaking  of which, Ranma left <i>special</i> instructions with me on how to  train <i>you</i>."</p><p>Nabiki gulped. Today was  starting off to be a <i>really</i> bad day.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>In front of Urd sat the  most ineligible bachelor in all of existence. The thirty something  had a crop of blond hair, sharp features and an absolutely perfect  physique; all wrapped in casual, yet trendy business attire. He took  another puff of his pipe and leaned back into the rich brown leather  chair, and she couldn't help but to smile… Like she was in the  presence of her older brother, somebody that would always be there  and look out for her.<p>"So how is our protégé  doing, Urd-chan?" God inquired with a friendly smile and the  Goddess sat down in the chair opposite of him.</p><p>Urd brushed a errant  strand of white hair from her face and returned the smile. "Quite  well. In over her head sometimes, but that seems to be where Ran-chan  thrives."</p><p>"Indeed." Kami-sama  agreed. "Still a bit rough around the edges, I see."</p><p>She smiled at the private  joke. Ranma wasn't the only one 'rough around the edges'.  "Would you have it any other way?"</p><p>God's smile turned into  a smirk. "Of course not. I guess I can let it slide given the fact  that she's only been on the job for two months."</p><p>Urd rolled her eyes, then  continued in a slightly more serious tone. "I don't suppose  you've given any thought to her request…?"</p><p>Kami-sama took a puff of  His pipe and gained a thoughtful countenance. "I have indeed,  daughter. Unfortunately I must decline the request."</p><p>"But…"</p><p>"…At this time." He  added gently. "Miss Saotome still has her road to walk, much like  you when you were still a child, Urd-chan." She blinked at the  direct correlation and Kami-sama continued. "And like you before,  her path is fraught with shadows and many darkened ends because of  her precarious balance. Strength and healing are what she needs right  now, not a crutch. If she turns to her birth form, she will not heal  and her spirit will not strengthen. As it is, Ranma will need both  for the project I am about to give her."</p><p>Urd looked at  well-dressed man in front of her, considering His words carefully. It  didn't seem fair, but Kami-sama was right. Ranma's former life  was a shambling nightmare and directly associated with that nightmare  was her gender. It bound his fiancées to him. His rivals. His  family's ideals. And it all relentlessly pounded away at him like a  jackhammer. It didn't take a psychologist to realize something  would have to give if it continued, but her promotion to Goddess  changed all that. The removal of her birth form had gone a long way  towards alleviating the burden placed upon her sister, Urd realized.  So many problems had simply evaporated with that fact alone, allowing  a significant amount of stress to up and disappear while the healing  took place. It also promoted balance. Eighteen years of Ranma's  life had not merely been spent as a man, but his parents twisted parody  of a man's man and that simply wouldn't do for a deity,  especially a first class, category one deity. Her job would bring her  into contact with every race, religion and sex imaginable, and over  the course of that mission she was sure to assume many forms. Not  simply that—</p><p>"Project?" Urd's  attention focused suddenly, realizing there was more to this meeting  than she had originally anticipated. "Doesn't she already have a  project?"</p><p>Kami-sama nodded.  "Indeed, but I'm afraid this one can't wait." Urd didn't  bother to hide the puzzled look on her face and God obliged with a  single word.</p><p>"<i>Saffron.</i>"</p><p>Urd's eyes widened as  she sucked in an involuntary breath. The word hung forebodingly  between father and daughter like a curse or some forbidden epithet.  She did<i> not </i>like where this conversation was heading. Saffron  had been a god once; A Phoenix god, but somewhere along the way he  had strayed. His focus turned inward and it wasn't long before the  only person he served was himself. Inevitably, that power hungry  megalomania brought him head to head with another whose first goal  above all else was to protect those who could not protect themselves;  someone who would do so with unflinching resolve. That day Saffron  made several mistakes. He kidnapped Ranma's fiancée. He  enslaved a friend. He threatened his family. And he woefully  underestimated just how far Saotome would go to safeguard the ones he  loved. That day Saffron learned the hard way that there were  boundaries to arrogance and not every mortal was to be trifled with.  But rebirth was a cycle of life concerning deities and Urd was  instantly tracking Kami-sama's logic. Even so…</p><p>"He has fallen from the  path once, daughter." God explained with a hint of sorrow. "I  cannot allow that to happen again."</p><p>Urd shook her head.  "Ranma's <i>not</i> going to be a happy camper."</p><p>God chuckled. "So why  do you think I brought her best friend to see me first?"</p><p>The Goddess of the Past  blinked and a frown spread across her face. The words "shoot the  messenger" just didn't quite cover this situation, so she settled  for a labored sighed. Some days it just didn't pay to get out of  bed.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Chapter 5 </b><p>"Yo, wake up." Ranma  gave Tenchi a light kick to the ribs, inciting a surprised snort from  the student. "Whatcha doing up here anyway? Pass out or something?"</p><p>Tenchi yawned and turned  over. Above him stood Ranma with an expression of curiosity on her  face, and beyond that, the evening sky. Evening sky? I'm still on  the school roof, Tenchi thought with some annoyance. "Oh great… I  fell asleep."</p><p>"Missed all your  classes this afternoon, too." She pointed out with light concern.  "Was gettin' worried about ya." For better or worse, she was  going to have to play guardian angel until his wife came along and  abducted him, and that meant going to school. At least it wasn't as  bad as Furikan, she noted. Besides, she could feel the wish in her  blood and its power was beginning to peak. Won't be too much longer  before—</p><p>"Meoow."</p><p>Tenchi turned and the  Goddess froze, hair sticking up on end. Pleasedontletitbeacat  — Ranma's mantra of survival was  interrupted as the student only managed to confirm her worst fears.  "Kitty! How did you get up here?" She now watched in horror as he  knelt down to coax it over and it happily obliged him by running in  their direction. The approaching sound of a cat bell signified her  impending doom.</p><p>"NononononONONONONOOOO!"  Ranma panicked, flailing wildly in panic as the feline approached,  her eyes wide as saucers. Tenchi simply stared at the  hyperventilating woman before him. "CAAAAATTTTT!" With that  final proclamation he watched with incredulity as she jumped over the  guard fence and off the rooftop, disappearing from sight</p><p>Tenchi shook his head.  What kind of Goddess is afraid of a… He looked around the vacant  roof …Cat? The cat was gone, spirited away as if it had never  existed. In its place however was something slightly more sinister. A  slight giggle attracted his attention and on the air conditioning  unit sat a woman. A wild mane of cyan hair framed her sharp features  and orange-yellow eyes. Another giggle issued from the woman and she  threw Tenchi a bell that sang through the air until it caught by him.</p><p>"Ryoko."</p><p>Tenchi gaped for a moment  then replied with his vast intellect. "Huh?"</p><p>She favored him with a  smile. "That's my name."</p><p>If she would have left it  at that, things would have been fine. She was cute. Proper  introductions could be made and Tenchi could go home. Sadly, the glow  in her eyes told him otherwise. No, this wasn't some sort of  emotional attachment on the part of the air conditioner-borne cat  girl. Tenchi watched as her eyes as they began to honest-to-God glow. A glow  he had seen somewhere before. A demonic glow. Orange points of energy  began to form around him and running was beginning to seem like a  <i>very</i> good idea.</p><p>"It was cold and dark  in there," She began, her voice carrying the weight of sorrow  behind it. "Seven hundred yeas have passed since I was trapped in  that cave." Fire began to creep into those incandescent eyes with  each spoken word. "<i>You'll never know how much pain I had to  suffer</i>."</p><p>It was obvious now,  Tenchi realized. "So you came back for... revenge!" Not that it  mattered when he tried to explain that it wasn't his fault. Or that  he had nothing to do with the Yosho character that trapped her there  in the first place. Of course, the freeze-dried demon comment hadn't  helped matters either.</p><p>The orange points of  light were sucked into her hand to form what looked to be a light  saber and it was at that moment that Tenchi decided that running was,  in fact, an excellent idea indeed.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It took five miles for  Ranma's brain to recover from its cat-induced crash and recover her  wits. She slid to a halt just outside a small all night convenience  store and mentally reviewed what had just happened. Letsee, she  thought. Um… Roof, Tenchi, cat. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's  all of—<p><i>BoooOOM!</i></p><p>The noise was distorted  by distance, but the low rumbling throb caught Ranma's attention  easily. If that weren't enough, an accompanying spike of power  pulsed through her brain and she knew it for what it was and where it  came from—A powerful discharge of energy directly from where she  just came. The school. And Tenchi. She took to the air and hovered at  an altitude of a hundred feet. Even from five miles out she could see  bolts of power lance across the campus and Ranma fumed. Dammit, he  <i>would</i> have to pick now to get abducted! First she'd take  care of Tenchi. <i>Then</i> she'd find whoever let that damn cat  onto the roof!</p><p>The distance only took  seconds to transverse at high-speed flight and Ranma looked down on  the situation—A cyan haired woman floating around throwing energy  bolts at <i>her</i> Tenchi! Ranma barely noticed her feminine aspect  creep in as she powered up for an energy blast of her own. The  nerve-!</p><p>Ryoko was having a grand  time. Free for the first time in seven hundred years and living out  the dream that had occupied so much of that time… Revenge on clan  Masaki-Jurai! Oh, sure, it wasn't that prick Yosho, but the boy  would do just fine in his place. She brought her hand to bear on the  running teen once again and an orange ball formed—A warning blasted  through Ryoko and she cut right on instinct, narrowly avoiding being  impaled by a sizzling bright blue energy bolt that passed through her  altitude and obliterated a good chunk of the school below in a plume  of holy fire. She spun around and found the newcomer hovering fifty  feet above her and away, menace glittering in the redhead's eyes.</p><p><i>"Leave him alone."</i></p><p>Ryoko stared at teen with  incredulity. Tenchi's girlfriend! The same girl who had jumped off  the roof ten minutes ago, she realized. Only now she's dressed  funny and lobbing energy bolts. What the hell…? She tried to read  the floating girl but turned up nothing. Definitely not Juraian,  Ryoko decided. But she could fly, so not human either. Oh well. Ryoko  powered up her next energy blast, aiming it at the redhead.  I'll just have to torture the information out of Tenchi after I  dispose of her...</p><p>The orange bolt streaked  in and Ranma tried a neat little trick she had learned since her last  visit to hell. The blast hit dead on, terminating abruptly three feet  from her person as its power crackled off an invisible barrier. She  tasted the energy strength as it rebounded on her shielding. The cyan  haired girl was powerful. Powerful enough to cause Skuld some  problems, but <i>she</i> was a Goddess first class, Category One unlimited.  Ranma smiled. Ryoko frowned.</p><p>It wasn't even going to  be close to fair.</p><p>She felt the girl's  power levels spike and Ryoko decided right there that her only chance  rested in an unrelenting offense. She snatched at the air, plucking  orange balls from it and heaving them at the girl four and five at a  time, only to have them crash off that ridiculous energy barrier of  hers. <i>Fine!</i> <i>Let's see how she likes hand to hand!</i> The glowing  orange bolts coalesced in her hands to form an energy sword and she  closed the distance rapidly. Time to hack the floating little redhead  in—</p><p><i>Crack!</i></p><p>-half? An glowing ivory  staff whipped out of nowhere and cracked against her energy sword and  now Ryoko stared into her mischievous grin. Who the HELL was this  girl!</p><p>"Well I WAS watching  out for Tenchi, but I missed my practice today, so…" Ranma  flipped Phoenix Wind around and the two were engaged, cracking at one  another's guard as they darted through the sky.</p><p>The object of the  female's attention was currently lying prone, watching the two  dance across the sky in combat. Lightening shrieked as blade struck  staff and the occasional energy blast tore down range. Tenchi watched  them arc into the school, destroying yet another wing of classrooms.  The building burned and Tenchi silently thanked God he had made it  out with book bag in hand before the gas line ruptured. What Ranma  and the demon were doing was simply icing on the cake after that. If  the rest of the structure survived the night it would positively be a  miracle.</p><p>Somehow he didn't see  Ranma being that generous.</p><p>Ryoko was having a bad  millennium. First she was defeated by that damned Yosho. Then she was  sealed in a tomb for the next seven hundred years. And THEN when it  was finally time to exact her vengeance, the person she had chosen to  hack into little bits had a damned magical girl body guard! Her  energy sword wavered as the staff bit into its field once more. And  what the hell was that thing made out of anyway! It radiated power  as easily as the litle girl floating in front of her and it sure wasn't  of Jurian origin. Ryoko lost altitude as the redheaded guardian  pressed her guard, leaning nose to nose.</p><p>"I think it's time to  end this little—" Ranma blinked as he stared into the demon's  eyes. Those weren't just eyes… They were <i>cat's eyes!</i> She  stiffened and pulled back. It was all the opportunity Ryoko needed.  The sword instantly transformed into an energy bolt while another  formed in her off hand. She was going to make her <i>pay</i> for that lapse.</p><p>Her concentration  shattered, Ranma's divine shielding was non-existent as the bolts  impacted from point-blank range, followed by a vicious uppercut and  savage kick to the gut. What Ryoko lacked in finesse, she more than  made up in brute force and raw firepower, and the dazed goddess took  every single hit on the chin. The cyan demon shoved another orange  bolt strait into Ranma's face and she went down in a long, tumbling  arc. Ryoko took stock of her handiwork. Her opponent's power levels  was still far too high and active for that to have been a knockout  blow, let alone anything close to lethal. That had to mean she's  only stunned, Ryoko surmised and locked onto Tenchi below. An evil  grin crept across her exhausted face. The red wouldn't be down for  long, so she'd better make the moment count. The sword formed in  her hand once again.</p><p><i>"Don't be scared  Sweetie Pie, here I come!"</i></p><p>Ryoko powered into her  dive, sword sweeping in high from on high and the only thing Tenchi  could do was hold his book bag up in pathetic defense. Needless to  say both were surprised when it began to bleed light on the downward  stroke. The bag was consumed and Ryoko phased back to avoid the  shockwave of light. <i>No!</i> The girl might not have had the power of  Jurai, but there was no mistaken THIS! The antique hilt floated in  the air before Tenchi and the woman knew she couldn't afford for  him to touch it.</p><p><i>Cra-Crack! Crack!</i></p><p>Ryoko was well and truly  pissed now. Did everybody have energy shielding today? She threw  another blast into him, only to have it crackle off the barrier of  light that now interposed itself between her and Tenchi.</p><p>"Shit!" The demon  spat and formed her energy sword as she plummeted in. She'd chop  the boy into kibble if it was the last thing she— Tenchi grasped  the hilt and even as the strike arced home. Lightening crackled  against her blade and the hilt came to life for the first time in  seven hundred years. The blue edge flickered to life and Ryoko  despaired once more.</p><p>"That's not playing  fair, <i>Tenchi!</i>" She tried to force the blade in further and  continued to meet impossible resistance.</p><p>While he couldn't  believe it himself, the notion of playing fair with this woman was  absolutely ludicrous. "Give me a break!" The sword's power  coursed through his body and made a connection. It recognized his  royal linage its energy levels spiked, throwing Ryoko away in a  movement almost of its own violation. It was all the incentive Tenchi  Masaki need to awaken his own training and he instinctive fell into  the Jurian combat form drilled into him by his grandfather. The  student pressed the sword's opening, driving the demon back with a  series of hard, desperate slashes. He was doing pretty well too until  he opened his mouth again. "Nobody wants to fight a monster like  you!"</p><p>Sure Ryoko was a space  pirate. And yeah, she was wanted dead or alive on eighty-seven  different worlds. Of course, there was that bit about destroying half  the Jurian main battle fleet too, but beyond all that Ryoko was a  woman. A crude, crass and incredibly powerful woman to be sure, but  woman nonetheless. You just don't call women monsters …Even if  they were sealed and mummified in a tomb for over seven hundred  years.</p><p>"MONSTER?" Tenchi's  blade hit a solid block and Ryoko's temper climaxed violently. The  next sword strike never came and the next thing he felt was a fist  applied forcefully to the side of his head, sending him into the  nearby fence. "How DARE you call me a MONSTER!" Even as she raged  forward, another spike of warning drove itself through her anger and  she threw herself aside at the last minute. A shockwave slapped  against her as another bright blue energy ball by her and into the  what little remained of the school. Ryoko hit the ground and  recovered, her towering rage now replaced by nervous apprehension.  The redhead was back up and radiating enough power to light a solar  system. She took a step back. It was exactly the distraction Tenchi  needed and the sword sensed the advantage, eager to score a desperate  blow. Torn between the need to defend against Tenchi's insanely  powerful bodyguard and the sword bearer himself, Ryoko twisted around  wildly, hoping to remover herself from both. She'd have to be  content with one out of two.</p><p>The move neatly removed  her from any fatal blows courtesy of Tenchi's blade, but brought  her arm into play which was promptly lopped off at the wrist. The  small jewel worn there separated and fell to the ground, producing an  explosion on impact. Both combatants froze and Ranma simply watched  the two from a distance. She was tempted to throw another energy  blast in, but something in the back of her mind was nagging her not  to. It took her only a moment to recognize it… The power of his  wish coming to fruition.</p><p>Ryoko's anger vanished  suddenly and her face turned rather thoughtful as she sighed. "Oh  well. Another battle lost. My miserable lot, I guess." Tenchi  stared and she finally noticed the stump where her hand used to be.  Ranma was slightly surprised that she seemed remarkably unconcerned.</p><p>Tenchi on the other hand  was horrified. "Sorry! The sword did it! I didn't mean to cut off  your hand!" The student produced a stiff, formal bow while Ryoko  giggled lightly and proceeded to regenerate her hand right there on  the spot with next to no effort. The amazed Tenchi stared as she  bowed like stager performer and smiled before sinking into the ground  from sight. Ranma stepped over to the student, both staring at the  patch of concrete that had consumed her. He looked at the Goddess of  Luck with equal parts shock and amazement playing across his face.  "Do you think we'll see her again?"</p><p>Unfortunately, Ranma knew  the answer to that one all too well. If the demon was bound that  tightly by his wish and The Ultimate Force… "Yeah, I think we can  count on it."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><b>Chapter 6</b><p>The Goddess of the Past ticked her  nails into the oaken wood bar impatiently, noting the clock on the  far wall of the establishment. Despite the antiquated appearance and  oversized gears driving a large, brass pendulum, the clock was, in  fact, tied directly to the Yggradsil and thus one of the most accurate  time pieces in all of creation. All of this meant only one thing to  the white maned woman alternately known as the Goddess of Love…</p><p>…Her friend and protégé  was <i>late.</i></p><p>A tan finger traced an errant droplet  of water across the oak countertop that managed to escape the glass  of ice water she was nursing, which was a crime in and of itself. The  water ought to have been sake and should have been consumed  in mass quantities over cavorting and laughter <i>if</i> a certain  redhead decided to grace her with her with her presence. Well, it  wouldn't all be laughter, she Urd amended silently as her eyes  swept across the crowded room of gods and goddess enjoying  themselves. No, she was the bearer of bad news tonight, bad news that  began with a capital 'Saffron'. All the more reason to soften the  blow with a few shots, she smiled internally.</p><p>She was just about to engage in  another round of mental grousing when the bar door opened, allowing  brighter daylight to infiltrate the softly lit establishment. The  silhouetted profile stood in the light, apparently searching the bar  for somebody in particular. To Urd, the shadow was unmistakable, and  she waved a hand to get its attention. The figure locked on to her  and made its way through the bustling crowd. The closer Ranma  got, the wider Urd's eyes became.</p><p><i>She was a mess.</i></p><p>"Do I even want to know?" Urd  asked without preamble, and the Goddess of Luck frowned. Her hair was  frazzled, robes slightly on the worn side, with a burn mark here and  there. Whatever it was, it wouldn't be good and she'd obviously  forgotten to tidy up.</p><p>"Tenchi and his rotten wish!" She  growled. Urd cocked her head and listened as the redhead unloaded.  "He unsealed an alien demon-woman, for cryin' out loud! Tried her  best to turn him sausage with her freakin' lightsaber!"</p><p>"…lightsaber?" Urd blinked,  then motioned for the bartending cherub to start rolling the sake.</p><p>"Oh, that ain't the half of it."  Ranma's wings quivered slightly, agitation that didn't go  unnoticed by the Goddess of the Past. "Get this… She followed him  home of all places, tried to seduce him, managed to call down <i>another</i>  vengeful alien, ran me over with a meowing starship and kidnapped  Tenchi!"</p><p>Urd stared in silence for a moment,  then simply shook her head. "Are you <i>sure</i> your domain isn't  chaos?"</p><p>"Just lucky I guess." Ranma  deadpanned the deliberate joke. "So I get aboard Ryoko's ship to  rescue Tenchi, only to have him kidnapped <i>again</i> by the <i>other</i>  alien."</p><p>"Did her ship meow too?" Urd  asked skeptically, and Ranma shrugged.</p><p>"No, hers was made of wood." The  redhead replied offhandedly and continued. "So I go off after  Tenchi, and Ayeka- the second alien's name –attacks us with these  logs…"</p><p>"Logs?"</p><p>"<i>Talking</i> logs," Ranma  emphasized. "Talking logs <i>with blasters</i>. Apparently, Ryoko  and Ayeka got some bad blood between 'em and the two start blowing  the crap out of each other in low earth orbit. They roasted one  another and fell into the mountains near Tenchi's house. Ported 'em  out before the crash, told Tenchi to call me if they acted up and got  the heck out of there."</p><p>Urd handed Ranma a shot glass, which  she eagerly downed. "You know, for a goddess one-one, subtly isn't  your strong suite."</p><p>The redhead's glass was already on  the bar and her fingers curling round another sake. "Talk to my  teacher." She replied, prompting a pained expression from her white  haired counterpart. "Did I mention we blew up a school?"</p><p>"Definitely your sister." The  cherub bartender winked at Urd before continuing to serve his  patrons.</p><p>"So how about you?" Ranma asked,  grinning at the jab. "Anything exciting happen to you today?"</p><p>"Oh, the usual." Urd shrugged.  "Just a meeting with Kami-sama.</p><p>Ranma's third glass of sake paused  on it's ascent up to her lips. 'The usual' didn't quite cover  meetings with God himself. That, and she had some questions for  Kami-sama, namely those involving the reinstatement of his male-form.  "Yeah, and?"</p><p>Urd took a deep breath. She wasn't  going to enjoy this. "Well, first He says there are some things  that need worked out before you can assume your male form." The  Goddess of Luck visibly deflated with the reply, but kept listening.  "The second was, well… Um… Here, have another drink." Ranma  took the proffered glass of sake wearily. "The second has to do  with another project He has in mind."</p><p>"What… project?" The redhead  asked carefully.</p><p>"There's somebody in desperate  need of guidance." Urd explained, talking around the subject.  "Somebody in desperate need of <i>your</i> guidance."</p><p>Ranma scowled. "Alright, alright. I  get the idea. Who?"</p><p>"<i>Saffron."</i></p><p>The Goddess of Luck went deathly  still. The only indication that there was any emotion roiling beneath  the calm exterior was a thin hairline fracture creeping up the side  of the sake glass she was gripping. "I can't."</p><p>"He needs help, Ra-chan." Urd  returned gently. "When you took him out, he was reborn. Unless  someone intervenes, he may very well turn back to his former path.  The consequences of that…"</p><p>"But <i>me</i>." Ranma replied  bitterly, finishing off the sake. "Why <i>me</i>? Don't I have  enough drama in my life?" Even as the words fell from her lips, she  knew why. She had the most recent contact with him, watched him  ascend to his most destructive potential and finally dealt him the  decisive blow that would reincarnate the immortal as a child. It was  a circle of rather sickening irony. She was there for his end and now  had been apparently chosen to see him through a new beginning.</p><p>"Kami-sama wouldn't give  something this important to you if He didn't think you could handle  it." Urd pointed out gently, then smiled. "Tell ya what. I'll  even tag along if it'll make you feel any better."</p><p>Ranma stared out into the bustling  crowed without actually seeing anything. "Yeah, I guess." Then,  with a heavy sigh, "Screw the sake. I seriously need a donut."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki Tendo stepped out of the furo,  loathing her existence despite the long soaking. The reason for that  loathing was quite simple- Ryoga Hibiki. It wasn't so much that  Hibiki was a bad guy per se. In fact, once you got past his  idiosyncrasies and the fact that he was a small black piglet when  immersed in cold water, he was found to be a really nice guy.<p>Except when he was Ranma Saotome's  stand-in as their instructor.</p><p>The middle Tendo rubbed her sore  muscles and sighed wearily. What in the world had possessed her to  become a part of the Nerima martial arts madness anyway? Ah yes, now  she remembered. Hormones. That, and the realization that there was  far more depth to Ranma than just being a martial arts jock. An  attractive depth. As if her ascension to goddess didn't speak volumes  on that particular topic. The girl rubbed a sore muscles as she pulled  a towel from the rack and wrapped it around her person, exiting the  bathroom.</p><p>Akane had endured the harder regiment  with relative ease. Oh, she was still tired, but unlike herself,  could still function at the end of the day. Skuld was fairing the  best of all. Being a goddess did have its benefits, after all, and  one of those was virtually limitless endurance. In fact, the only way   Hibiki had to tire her was by forcing her to tap her magical  potential while doing martial arts. Making mundane objects float  across the room while having to dodge Ryoga's pummeling was an  exceedingly good way to tax the goddesses limits. But unlike the  little goddess, they had to go to <i>school</i> after practice.</p><p>All in all, they looked like death  warmed over by the end of the day.</p><p>"And now this late breaking  report…!" The sound of the television drew her from the stairs up  to her room, and she peered into the living room, finding Akane  staring rapt at a smartly dressed suit with the caption 'Gas  Explosion!' cycling below him. "<i>The fire department is  currently responding to a five alarm fire occurring less than an hour  ago. The Soushikisei High School was apparently reduced to flame and  rubble when a gas main ruptured, destroying the entire campus.  Authorities have yet to assertain…</i>"</p><p>"You seeing this!" Akane stared  into the television with wide eyes as the picture cut from the news  anchor to live footage of what looked to be a flaming warzone.</p><p>"Oh my…" Even Kasumi had been  coaxed to put down her book and watch the spectacle.</p><p>Akane continued to shake her head.  "That's insane…" Then as an afterthought, "Why can't  something like that happen to our high school?"</p><p>Nabiki's brain, however, was hard  at work putting two and two together. Nerima was quiet. Ranma was at  'work'. Another part of Tokyo just spontaneously blew up in a  most violent fashion. Ergo, there was only one place the Martial Arts  Goddess of Luck could be. Sure, she'd have to make a few calls just  to be sure, the middle Tendo thought, but she was all but certain…</p><p>"Say, Akane… How'd you like to  take a trip to Chuugoku this weekend?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Two robed women overlooked the  majesty of the Byankala mountain range and the valley below from  their own mountainous vantage point. The first was familiar with the  area, having traveled off and on within the Quinghai providence of  China for well over the last millennia. In fact, there were few  places on Earth she hadn't been at one time or another. The second  was a relative newcomer to the region. Her experience stemmed mostly  from a number of unfortunate incidents, in part due to her father  while the rest could be attributed to just plain bad luck. Both now  stood atop the second tallest peak in the range, looking out upon the  first.<p>Phoenix Mountain.</p><p>"I ain't looking forward to  this." Ranma grumbled, frowning out at the peak. Above it, small  figures seemed to float around the hollowed out cone. At this  distance, discerning their identity was marginal at best, but the  redhead didn't need guess work to know who and what the winged  figures represented.</p><p>Urd nodded, keeping an even  expression. Of course she wasn't looking forward to this. These were  only the people that threatened her friends and family as a mortal,  not to mention the home of her one-time adversary. The Goddess of the  Past squinted slightly. "I think they've noticed us."</p><p>The redhead nodded as three of the  specs separated from the wandering cloud, angling down toward them.  At least there was one good thing to come of the situation, Ranma  thought as the winged figures moved into their airspace. They were in  one hellva rude surprise when they found out exactly what she had  become. The trio of armed Phoenix people made a shallow decent onto  their peak, kicking up a light cloud of dust and causing their robes  to flutter with their landings. Two winged men and one woman clad in  light golden body armor stepped up to the pair with haughty  expressions plastered across their face. Yeah, Ranma thought with  amusement. She was <i>so</i> looking forward to dropping this bomb.</p><p>"And just who are you to trespass  into the territory of the Phoenix, mortals?" The bird woman  sneered, prompting Urd to roll her eyes.</p><p>"Pretty arrogant, eh Ran-chan?"  She smiled pleasantly.</p><p>"Same ol', same ol'." Ranma  shrugged. Clearly, their reactions had been expected.</p><p>"You mock us, <i>Landling?</i>"  One of the bird men took a step forward, but failed to move the  aforementioned landlings to any sort of fear of panic.</p><p>"No, we're saving that for  later." The Goddess of the Past stated matter-of-factly, causing  Ranma to barely suppress a smile.</p><p>"Here to see Kiima and Saffron."  The Goddess of Luck stated, fiddling with her long red braid in  bordom. "Tell 'em Ranma Saotome sent ya."</p><p>The birdman instantly dropped any  pretense of threat and took a step back. "Ranma…?"</p><p>"…Saotome?" His bird woman  compatriot finished, her fearsome mask cracking completely.</p><p>"They seem to know you Ran-chan!"  Urd grinned, nudging her redheaded friend.</p><p>Ranma took the nudges in stride.  "Yeah, that's me, mister famous." Her stare into the trio  hardened. "So ya gonna go and announce us or something? Would  really hate for there to be another misunderstanding… <i>Like last  time</i>."</p><p>All three Phoenix people paled. They clearly remembered  the last misunderstanding with Ranma Saotome and vacated the area  abruptly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Captain Kiima studied her uninvited  guests warily, especially the redheaded one. Ranma Saotome she knew  and knew well. After all, the Slayer of Saffron wasn't a person to  easily slip from ones recollection. She adjusted the long sword at  her hip, knowing full well that if it came down to using it, she  would come up well short- armed or not -against the martial artist.  Saffron had been the best of them, after all. Kiima knew she was  good, but not <i>that</i> good. Still, there was something different  about the Saotome today. While she hadn't had a lot of exposure to  his cursed form, she had to wonder why he hadn't come as a male.  Nearly half of the mountain's population knew that face on sight  and the outer sentries wouldn't have challenged him in such a  matter had they know this girl was he in the first place. Then there  was her state of dress. Last she had known, the Ranma Saotome she  knew wasn't so well adjusted to her female form to be wearing the  fine robes she currently sported, let alone jewelry, and a long,  waist length ponytail. Grudging acceptance? Yes. Indulgence?  Definitely not. It was oddness only compounded by the fact that her  long white haired friend was in nearly the same style of elaborate  robbing, with minor differences; namely in the fact that she had no  problems showing off her well endowed body. They even shared facial  tattooing. The Captain shrugged mentally. Not that any of those  thoughts really mattered to her. The only thing that did was to find  out what the Saotome wanted and to send him on his way before he  caused more trouble.<p>"I must admit to some surprise,"  The Captain admitted aloud as she strode into the room that contained  the waiting women. Ranma put down a intricately carved decorative  tusk she had found on a table while the tanned stranger set aside a  brightly colored magazine. "As you are the last person I'd expect  to see, and so soon."</p><p>Ranma set the horn down and nodded.  "You and me both."</p><p>"Your friend?"</p><p>Ranma glanced over to Urd, who was  smiling pleasantly. "Oh, don't mind me. I'm just here to make  sure Ran-chan here doesn't level your quaint little mountain."</p><p>The Phoenix woman stiffened and her  serious face masked turned to one of irritation. "If you think  threats will endear yourself to our graces, you are <i>sadly</i>  mistaken." Koruma and Masara behind her rested taloned hands on  their weapons as she continued. "You had best tell us the purpose  of your visit before things become… unpleasant."</p><p>"Already are…" Ranma grumbled,  then addressed her directly. "Where's Saffron?"</p><p>Kiima studied the martial artist  carefully. "Why do you want to know?"</p><p>"Got business with him." Ranma  replied tersely, irritation creeping into her voice.</p><p>"Then your business is with <i>me</i>."  The winged woman returned sharply. "Lest you forget the results of  your own battle. Saffron is neither mentally or physically capable to  deal with 'business."</p><p>Ranma ground her teeth down. "Yeah,  well then if I remember right, you're the person in charge of  raising him again?"</p><p>"Of course." Kiima replied. Her  face clearly indicated it wasn't one of her favorite duties. "But  what does that have to do with your <i>business?</i>"</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath and looked  back to Urd, who simply nodded in support. It took a moment to gather  the force of will necessary to say her next words.</p><p>"I'll be taking that over from  now on."</p><p>Kiima blinked. She couldn't have  just heard what she thought she heard and certainly not from Ranma.  "I'm… I'm afraid I don't understand."</p><p>Ranma simply shook her head and  sighed wearily. "I'll be takin' over teachin' the kid."</p><p>More blinking ensued as the Captain  tried to determine if Ranma was actually serious. Granted, she tired  of playing nursemaid and tutor to the future ruler of the Phoenix,  but foisting him off on the person who nearly killed him…? "Please  don't tell me you traveled from Japan just to humor me. The real  purpose of your visit. Now."</p><p>A slight growl rose from Ranma's  throat. "That <i>is</i> the real purpose of my visit."</p><p>Another moment of silence ensued as  Kiima tried to wrap her brain around the statement and the serious  tone the pony-tailed martial artist issued it in. He was serious! He  thought he was going to just walk into the fortress of the Phoenix  and walk out with its leader! "And what makes you think I'd allow  such an event take place? You may be able to best any one of us in  single combat, but you would fall to attrition one way or the other."</p><p>"Show her your credentials,  Ran-chan." Urd remarked, stepping up to her side. With her words, a  sheet of white feathers faded into reality and unfolded from Ranma's  back. With the wings, a wave of tangible power slapped into the  Phoenix. Urd did the same and the room occupants stepped back in  collective shock. Kiima's eye began to twitch.</p><p>"You… <i>You're a Phoenix!</i>"  Kiima gasped with incredulity. Her friend too! The question of 'how'  raced through her brain as she struggled to cope with the sight in  front of her. While she wouldn't go so far as to say it was  outright impossible, highly unlikely did come to mind as there was no  Spring of Drowned Phoenix, nor any magic that she knew of that would  transform one into such a creature. Moreover, their forms were wrong.  Slight details were amiss, such as the total lack of talons on their  fingertips or fangs. Regardless, she was pretty sure that Ranma  didn't have wings <i>or </i>the potential to grow them when they  last parted company.</p><p>Ranma simply shook her head and  allowed a small smile to form. "Nope. Let me introduce Urd, Goddess  of the Love and the Past…"</p><p>The white haired goddess inclined her  head slightly and Kiima's twitch continued. "Which would make  you…"</p><p>"Ranma Saotome, Goddess of Luck."  Kiima nearly staggered back, as if she had been physically struck.  "We're on a mission from God."</p><p>The Phoenix woman was literally  speechless. She had known that Saffron was some form of divinity, but  to have others actually step in and manifest themselves in front of  her… And Ranma Saotome, no less! "Have… have you always been  like this? Hiding your true form?"</p><p>"Heh," Ranma chuckled dryly.  "Nope, just my luck hard at work."</p><p>Kiima chewed on the enigmatic comment  for a moment before Urd cut it off by shaking her head. "Don't  ask."</p><p>The Captain of the Phoenix guard  nodded dumbly and moved on to the next question. "And Lord  Saffron?"</p><p>Ranma's good mood at having  surprised her audience evaporated. "I broke him, I get to fix him."</p><p>"Meaning?"</p><p>"Meaning that Kami-sama has decided  that Ranma is the best person for the task of raising Saffron." Urd  supplied. "Think of Ran-chan here as his new tutor."</p><p>"His… tutor?" Kiima boggled,  her wings shifting with uncertainty. "Here?"</p><p>"Ha!" Ranma guwuffed suddenly.  "Ain't now way I'm sticken' around here, especially  considerin' how he turned out last time. If I'm gonna be stuck  with the kid, I'm gonna make sure he turns out right."</p><p>Kiima's eyes widened and her face  indicated she had taken offense to the comment, but the emotion only  lasted as long as it took Urd to take a step forward, leaning into  the women's nose. It also helped she was glowing blue with divine  power. "Don't forget who you're dealing with, <i>little girl</i>."</p><p>The Captain nodded shakily, having  received the message loud and clear. Ranma smiled a patronizing  smile. "How about you get Saffron out here? <i>Now.</i>"</p><p>"Um, ah… My apologies, High  Ones!" She stammered, and nodded to the guards. Her only  consolation as they left to fetch their leader was the fact that he  would be in familiar company. That, and she wouldn't be the one  taking care of him. "He will require an armed escort at all-"</p><p>"Alone."  Ranma shook her head, casuing the Phoenix Captain further  constrenation. "I already have to babysit one kid. Don't need to  babysit your guards as well." Kiima was thinking about pushing her  protest, but one look back into the glittering eyes of Ranma's friend  squashed the objection outright. She hated it. <i>Really</i> hated sending Saffron with them without a platoon of royal guard, but the women in front of her now were divinity, after all...</p>"I demand an explanation for  interrupting Lord Saffron's… lesson!" The guard's return was  marked by the bluster of an elderly voice, its objection cut short as  he and his student were ushered into the waiting room. The robed hunchback stood  there staring at the vision before him like Kiima before—Two women,  one hated enemy, both wearing wings. "What…! They…What is <i>he</i>  doing here?"<p>Kiima winced at his tone, especially  now that she was painfully aware that both women actually <i>could</i>  take there mountain apart with absolute impunity. "Mind yourself,  Muskrat. You are in the presence of High Ones."</p><p>Ranma Saotome paid the pair no mind,  her focus consumed entirely by the young Saffron. He definitely  wasn't the monster she remembered. Even before he had ascended, the  Phoenix God looked something close to ten years old. Now he was six,  tops. He was eerily familiar, but a stranger at the same time,  and she watched as his red eyes wandered across the room and locked  onto hers.</p><p><i>He recognizes me?</i></p><p>No, she realized. Not quite. The  young Phoenix God cocked his head, as if trying to recall something  about her that was just beyond his grasp. He looked from her, to Urd,  his tutor and finally settled on Kiima. "Who're they,  Kiima-chan?"</p><p>An indecisive look settled across  Kiima's face. "Um, they're your new teachers…"</p><p>"New teachers?" Muskrat  squealed, practically quivering with rage. "But I'm—!"</p><p>"SILENCE!" Kiima cast a hard  stare into him, cutting his rage off abruptly and causing the wrinkled elder to quiver. The last thing she was  going to do was piss off divinity, let alone give the Saotome an  excuse to take apart their mountain. No, if Kami-sama wanted Ranma to  teach Saffron, he could damn well have him. She took the godling by  his hand and smiled at his surprised expression. "Saffron, this  is…"</p><p>"Urd." The bronze skinned goddess  smiled broadly, taking over introductions. "And this is your <i>Auntie</i>  Ranma." Ranma's eyes widened at the title, and Saffron stared at  the redhead with fascination. "You two are going to be <i>best</i>  friends."</p><p>Ranma twisted around to stare a hole  into her best friend, who in turn favored her with a malicious smile.  Then she turned back to Saffron, who was already stepping toward her.</p><p>"You're my Auntie?"</p><p>It was all the Goddess of Luck could  do not to puke right then and there as she looked into young  Saffron's hopeful eyes. She sighed internally and knelt down to the  boy's height. "Uh, yeah. Sure kiddo."</p><p>The boy immediately lurched forward  in delight, wrapping his diminutive stature around the redhead, who  was already thinking of the numerous ways she could pay best friend  back …with a vengeance.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane, Nabiki and Skuld waited in the  Tendo dojo by dawns early light, fully expecting Ryoga Hibiki to once  again take over their lessons. This was of little surprise to the  long, black haired Goddess of the Future, as she knew from the  experience of her sisters that pulling wish duty could be a long,  drawn out process. Her thoughts then wandered inxonerably to  Belldandy, whose wish was looking to last a lifetime, if not more.<p>Sure enough, the Hibiki stepped in  right on schedule, unexpectedly followed by a redhead clad in  traditional red and black Chinese silks. Neither looked too happy at  the moment.</p><p>"Ranma!" Akane's eyes  widened, also having expected not to see the martial artist for a  couple of days. She was about ready to step up to her former fiancée  when she noticed the faces and jumped to an entirely too familiar  conclusion. "You haven't been fighting with Ryoga-kun have you?"</p><p>Ranma was about to open her mouth  when Nabiki pre-empted her response. "Ranma's a goddess now,  Akane. I think she's got better things to do."</p><p>Akane looked from Ranma, to her older  sister with a light glare, making it obvious that the opinion of her  perverted sister wasn't necessarily a welcome one. It seemed to quiet  her down, regardless. Skuld, however, had one.</p><p>"The wish done already ,  Onee-chan?"</p><p>Ranma shook her head with a bland  expression on her face. "If only. I'll probably be ducking in  and out for the next few weeks, so yas better be getting used to  Ryoga here." The groans that accompanied the statement made the  lost Boy produce a fanged grin. "But I got some important news.  We have a forth student."</p><p>"Forth?" Akane blinked,  while Nabiki began racking her brain as to who this person might be.  Hell, the way Ranma's life has been going lately, it could very well  be Kuno, and believably so. Even so, she hadn't heard even a whisper  through her intelligence network concerning him or any other students  at Furinkan, which could mean-</p><p>"Another Goddess?" Skuld  piped out the question hopefully. Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Almost." Ranma answered.  Still, her reply was far from the enthusiastic response with which he  announced his last student. "First, some ground rules."  Nabiki began to get a sinking pit in her stomach. Ground rules? For a  student? Something wasn't right… "The most important of which  is that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all."</p><p>"Um, Ranma? What's the name of  our student?"</p><p>The redhead studiously ignored the  question. "Second, this is not the same person you knew. If ya  can't handle it, you're free to quit." The pit in Nabiki's  stomache grew, and even the other two students were beginning to feel  a sense of foreboding. Ryoga's stone, emotionless face wasn't helping  matters. <i>This isn't going to be good</i>. "Finally, any  problems ya have with him go through me. He's my responsibility,  assigned by Kami-sama Himself."</p><p>Skuld's eyes widened as the  implication rained home. Not a goddess, but a god? Was it anybody she  knew? Assigned by God himself? Who could be-</p><p>"Come on in."</p><p>All eyes shifted to the doorway where  a boy in exotic pasteled silks walked into the dojo. As exotic as the  wardrobe was, it was easily eclipsed by his fiery mane of orange and  red hair. Skuld merely stared without comprehension, as did Nabiki.  Neither recognized the boy. Akane did, however, and her jaw nearly  dropped off its hinge right then and there.</p><p>"It's… He's… HE'S…!"</p><p>Ranma Saotome, Goddess of Luck First  Class, Category One nodded to the boy, who took a step forward to the  waiting girls. His red eyes flicked curiously from one to the other  in quick succession.</p><p>"My name's Saffron. Auntie Ranma  said we're going to train together?"</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><u><b>Author's notes</b></u><br/><i>Yeah, I know pt5 has been a long time  in coming, so I hope it delivers.
