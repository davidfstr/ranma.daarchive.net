</div>Disclaimer: After these messages...<p>Author's note (you can skip this since it is VERY long, or come back to it after you read the<br/>story below): First of all, if you're interested in the reason for me taking so long in posting<br/>this, then read my excuse at the end. Also, I did a little bit of revising on the first part. You<br/>see, I got Ranma 1/2 graphic novel #26 in the mail the day after I posted part one, and I've<br/>been under the impression by MANY authors that Ranma disappears while cloaking himself<br/>with a cloth using a technique from the umisen-ken. But he doesn't disappear! What's up<br/>with that?<p>So, I had a quick solution that suited the situation better. It's not really worth reading the<br/>whole part again for, so I'll be mentioning the technique "Dark side of the moon" uses to<br/>disappear somewhere in the second chapter. If you feel like finding that part I changed, then<br/>by all means do. Just use this key word to get there: umisen-ken.<p>Oh, and I also gave an explanation for why Ranma chose to go to her place of residence, in<br/>response to one of my reviewers. I try my best to explain the character's actions and<br/>responses, so I couldn't pass it up after a lack of such was pointed out. .<p>I also cleaned up the scene with Ranma's guardian, since I read over it and had a hard time<br/>understanding what I had written. .; It's clarified now, and the guardian actually makes it<br/>clear as to how she is Ranma (or a part of, anyway).<p>Anyway, I'm surprised I had positive responses to this. I know there are alot of old,<br/>overused plot devices and elements in this, but I needed to use them in order to get the<br/>story in the direction I need. The whole purpose of writing this story isn't about plot,<br/>anyway: it's about making Ranma an important member of the Sailor moon series without<br/>changing the pre-existing history of it. I'd be giving too much away if I said more, so just<br/>wait until I reveal Ranma's role in future chapters, okay?<p>And now I'd like to respond to these sixteen reviews...<p>I appreciate the feedback very much, but please don't allow the part about Ranma being a<br/>senshi or a girl spoil the story for you because they're only devices that are needed to<br/>complete and make the plot fully functional. I know how some people are about these<br/>things, so I can only hope you can enjoy the story for why it's written and not how it gets<br/>accomplished. I've spent a great deal of time putting this thing together, and you'll<br/>understand once you find the first chapter fifty-thousand words long.<p>At any rate, if you stick with me as I write, you'll find that there's more to this story than<br/>Ranma being a senshi and all that. My main focus is character development, mind you; not<br/>wish fulfillment: I wasn't going to just write this because I decided to have a senshi inspired<br/>by one of my most favorite rock bands, so I came up with ideas to support and otherwise<br/>overwhelm the reason this story is being written. This could have just been a Sailor Moon<br/>story, but that wouldn't have been fun or hard to do.<p>And as far as being too descriptive, I find that racing through events without giving much<br/>detail doesn't really give anyone a chance to imagine much of anything by the time<br/>something else happens. I mean, we all know what Ranma looks like as a girl, but I only did a<br/>general comparison with her guardian to describe her appearance, and I'm sure there was<br/>plenty left for the imagination to picture her as they see her in their mind's eye without me<br/>changing what's already there.<p>I went all-out describing Ranma's senshi uniform because hers is different, and you needed<br/>to know those differences. Sure, you may know what all the other senshi's outfits look like,<br/>but they all have something that distinguishes them from one another; and I'm not talking<br/>about their colors (though you did need to know that Ranma's colors were different than the<br/>others, as well). I wanted to make a distinction between Ranma and the others' uniforms, and<br/>that Ranma wasn't sailor moon, and wasn't going to replace sailor moon.<p>Also, I want to give my story an environment. I don't want to just write how "Ranma ran<br/>from the front door to the guest room." Can you really enjoy picturing that by the time<br/>"Ranma enters and takes a nap?" No; I want Ranma to "dash up the stairs, round into the<br/>hallway, and stop abruptly at the door to the guest room to open it." Then, I want him to<br/>"toss his backpack aside, strip to his undershirt and boxers, lay out his futon, and then lay<br/>upon it and take a nap after a trying day at school." I may be going into detail, but it makes<br/>your imagination work more efficiently than you think. Did you really see everything I wrote<br/>when comparing the first example with the second? If so, then you must be one of the few<br/>who take their time to do all the extra work: which only means I'm not doing my job as a<br/>writer by making readers add necessary information themselves.<p>That's the difference between stories for children and stories for young adults upward: what<br/>children's stories lack in detail, compensate by using pictures; and stories for the elder<br/>population that lack pictures, compensate for it with details. . For the most part, anyway:<br/>there are always exceptions.<p>At any rate, your imagination is how you interpret my words in this case. The more<br/>descriptive I am, the more your imagination works; it's as simple as that.<p>Finally, who Ranma ends up with is still up in the air, so don't think Akane's out of the<br/>equation. I DO have someone for Ranma, but that'll be revealed much later... Until then,<br/>Ranma CAN be in a serious relationship with someone else during the time frame most of<br/>this story takes place.<p>So, before I go too far along in the story and decide who Ranma ends up with, send me your<br/>suggestions; though be mindful that Ranma still considers herself a guy: in the sense that<br/>she doesn't conform to the role of a woman (so Ranma doesn't have a sudden interest in<br/>men or anything like that).<p>You can suggest anyone, really; but do give a brief reason as to why. I don't care if the<br/>character is currently out of the picture, across the ocean, on another planet, or would never<br/>find themselves interested in Ranma; just suggest them and I'll see what I can do. I will admit<br/>that I'll favor the odd, seemingly-impossible and outlandish ones, however.<p>As for Akane not being Ranma's partner, she only wanted Ranma to lose against Ryoga so<br/>Ranma would be humiliated and perhaps even part with some of that overinflated ego of his.<br/>Sure, Akane usually DOES want Ranma to win, but Ryoga is an exception since she thinks<br/>that Ranma picks on him all the time. Makes sense, no?<p>Maybe I should reply to the reviews IN the reviews... .;<p>Well, I hope you will enjoy this story, but I'm not very confident about my success in doing<br/>so. I'll just have to wait and see what happens.<p>Now, enjoy the story! (I hope!)<p>Dark side of the moon<br/>By: Crescent Pulsar<p>-<p>Closing the door behind her quickly though silently upon entering the bathroom, Ranma<br/>rushed over to the mirror above the sink to get a better look at her hair. Turning her head<br/>aside as she gazed at her reflection from askance, she once again pulled her hair over her<br/>shoulder; only this time she could see it from a better perspective.<p>A better perspective than she thought, perhaps. The person reflected in the mirror was her,<br/>yet it was not. Nothing had changed (except for the fact that her hair was longer and was<br/>lengthening before her eyes), but something told her that she had, indeed, changed. Then,<br/>she realized, it didn't concern her body. No; it was her clothing that was amiss: not because<br/>they were damaged beyond repair, but rather for the reason of being different from... normal.<p>Normal? But weren't her current attire normal? Of course they were! However, a memory of<br/>seeing herself in other clothing reflected from a polished metal surface told her that she<br/>WAS wearing different clothes. In fact, everything she owned was different from her tunics,<br/>robes, sandals and animal skins.<p>Wide-eyed, Ranma stared at herself in the mirror, wondering where all these strange<br/>thoughts were coming from. "Whuh... What's happening to me...?" She whispered, her heart<br/>picking up its pace as fear found a home inside it.<p>-<br/>Chapter one - Part two: Consequences<p>Ranma was soon stripping herself of her clothing and tossing them into the trash (except for<br/>her boxers, which found themselves in the hamper since they were in good repair).<br/>Afterwards, she entered the furoba and gathered the necessary supplies for her ablutions:<br/>stool, bucket, washbasin, soap and sponge. There were already two towels on the rack, so<br/>she didn't have to get one (just replace the one she used after she was done).<p>Sitting on the stool, she refrained from looking at her reflection in the large mirror over the<br/>faucets as she filled her bucket with cold water. She didn't want to admit it, but she was, as<br/>best as she could tell, disconcerted over the recent course of events. And who wouldn't be,<br/>after seeing and knowing things in your mind that you knew were not yours?<p>However, as she progressed through the cleansing of her body, she soon calmed down and<br/>came to the conclusion that it was somehow due to her being a senshi. Her guardian had<br/>mentioned something about unlocking memories... Maybe that is what she had done, by<br/>accepting her heritage? She wasn't sure, but that was the best explanation she could come<br/>up with.<p>After she finished washing her body, she then concentrated on her longer hair, having<br/>saved it for last since she didn't know what to do with it yet. Already she could tell that it<br/>had grown whilst she attended to her body, and that her hair looked ridiculous plaited so<br/>loosely while wet. So, deciding that she, at least, had to clean her hair, she freed her fiery<br/>tresses of the string which bound them and began to administer more shampoo than she'd<br/>ever had to use before.<p>It was while she rinsed her hair of the shampoo that an odd thought occurred to her: why<br/>cut her hair back to its original length? How many years would it have taken for anyone to<br/>acquire such length, normally? Three years or so? Four? Past memories told her of how hard<br/>it was, caring and waiting patiently for her hair to grow to the length she desired, and how<br/>proud she was once she finally met that goal. These were not Ranma's memories, but she<br/>could understand, and was soon considering leaving her hair as long as it would grow<br/>(which she knew would be at the base of her bottom).<p>Reluctantly, she stood up and faced the mirror, seeing herself with long, wet, (and for the<br/>moment) clinging hair. It almost seemed like she had blood coursing down her body. Of<br/>course, she saw more than her hair in the mirror: she also saw the curves of a young woman,<br/>that her hair made more pronounced as it cascaded down and over her torso, highlighting<br/>her slim shoulders and fragile clavicles, and accentuating her bountiful bosom, slight waist,<br/>and perfect, child-bearing hips (that's what doctor Tofu's mother said, anyway).<p>Tearing her attention away from the mirror, her body shuddering, she opted to get into the<br/>hot waters of the furo as soon as possible. Her past self had seen the same image in her<br/>mirror of polished silver on many occasions, and it frightened her to find herself just as<br/>proud about the woman she had seen. Sure, maybe it never bothered her before, but to<br/>know that a real girl regarded her body in much the same way as she did, was unsettling to<br/>say the least. She just hoped it wasn't an effect from being cursed, and was instead natural;<br/>THAT she could handle.<p>Being female in hot water, however, was not something she could handle; and that's the<br/>exact situation she found herself in. She sat there, unmoving, the water lapping over the<br/>swells of her breasts after her entrance into the previously-calm waters of the furo, and<br/>resolved to not cry out as she had done the previous times. Okay, maybe she had been<br/>extremely sensitive to the warmer scale of water temperature the first time due to being<br/>inflicted by the full-body cat tongue, but she couldn't excuse the second.<p>Soon, her body trembled, as frustration, sadness, anger, helplessness and loss welled up<br/>within her being. Tears gathered at the corners of her eyes, knowing that the third time was<br/>going to be the charm (if one could call it that in this circumstance). And, before long, she<br/>buried her face into her hands and wept. She may not be the smartest banana of the bunch,<br/>but she knew, deep down, that her choice had not only made her a senshi, but a female, also.<br/>"What have I ever done to deserve this?" She wondered amidst her sobs. "Why me?"<p>Unbeknownst to Ranma, there was one, unsuspecting, sympathetic ear on the opposite side<br/>of the shouji that separated the bathroom from the furoba. Well, there were two ears, but<br/>they both, nonetheless, belonged to Nabiki.<p>Nabiki, of course, had a camera in her hand. Why else would she be at her current location,<br/>after learning that Ranma had returned and was taking a bath? It was the best opportunity to<br/>take pictures of a naked Ranma, who'd usually be too exhausted and sore after a fight with<br/>Ryoga to notice her presence.<p>But she never expected to bear witness to this, nor did she plan to take advantage of it. She<br/>wasn't that cruel, you know; far from it, in fact. She could almost empathize with Ranma,<br/>watching as she cried over the loss of a loved one. Although, could anyone ever lose<br/>someone more important than themselves?<p>That ultimately depended on the individual, didn't it? How would she feel, if she had become<br/>a man without a way of knowing how to regain her real body, her female body? She'd like to<br/>think that she'd be calm and accepting, but knew better: she'd be devastated. And she knew<br/>that that was one among many feelings that her sister's fiance was feeling at the moment.<p>How does she know Ranma's condition, you ask? She doesn't. However, she knows very<br/>well that Ranma wouldn't cry over being stuck as a female if it were reversible. Now that the<br/>springs at Jusenkyo were flooded and, consequently, mixed, she knew that Ranma knew of<br/>no other way to become male unless her curse was locked by the chiisuiton. If her curse<br/>were made permanent any other way, then there was no chance of being male again unless<br/>there was a known counter to it. It seems that, to Ranma, there wasn't.<p>At any rate, she could very well take a few pictures of this moment. There were countless<br/>people, both inside and out of school, that would enjoy seeing the confident, macho Ranma<br/>broken down like SHE was in all HER naked glory. Just copies of a single picture from this<br/>very scene would, in a day, bring in enough profit as she usually made off Ranma, on<br/>average, in a month's time.<p>One depressed button, and a click later, and she did, indeed, have that single photograph.<p>Tendrils of red floated about her in the now-warm recesses of the water, the larger ones<br/>slithering about beneath the water level and along the bed of the furo, while the smaller ones<br/>wafted over and just below the surface. Sniffling, Ranma didn't know how much time elapsed<br/>as she cried, but knew that her hair was as long as it would get by then.<p>The sight of it floating about her had a strange, mollifying effect that she couldn't explain.<br/>She supposed that it could be the gentle movements of her tresses as they wavered so<br/>calmly around her, but the thought that the water could have been filled with her blood<br/>instead of her crimson hair was just as possible a cause. However, the thought of giving up<br/>wasn't even present for consideration.<p>That didn't mean she knew what to do, however. She wondered, though, as she stared<br/>down at her reflection on the water's surface, sometimes focusing on her hair and legs<br/>beneath it. Being a girl for the rest of her life was such a drastic change. Hardly anyone ever<br/>considered it, but Ranma had, throughout her time being cursed, learned that changing your<br/>sexual role was so life-altering that surely nothing else could compare. It wasn't just your<br/>outlook that changed, but how others saw you, how they treated you, and how you<br/>respond to said treatment. Also, there was what society expected of you, as well as what the<br/>nature of your being imposed.<p>To put it simply: Ranma did not want to live the life of a woman. She had nothing against the<br/>other half of the human race, but she did not find the limitations they had in society, as well<br/>as their role in reproduction, appealing. If the world were more like life in the Amazon village<br/>of yore (and she suspected that it hadn't changed), then she wouldn't have nearly as many<br/>qualms as she presently did.<p>Blinking, she realized that she had lived her past life as an Amazon. Laws that she never<br/>knew about, she now knew; and the ones she had already known, now made more sense.<p>Quite uncharacteristically, she, in surprise, murmured: "Oh, my..." And, idly, she wondered<br/>how the old ghoul would react to her being an Amazon.<p>Surprisingly, being an Amazon actually appealed to her, now that she knew more about their<br/>culture and history. And why shouldn't it, knowing she would fit in almost seamlessly with<br/>that lifestyle? (Which she preferred over being a housewife that had no adventure at all.)<br/>What place did she have with her family, with the Tendo's, now that she was a girl, anyway?<p>"No place..." She concluded, her mental voice dismal. Being a girl, she couldn't marry a<br/>Tendo, couldn't produce an heir, and couldn't be her mother's manly son. Worst of all, she<br/>had no chance of having a relationship with Akane anymore. Sure, she was against the<br/>whole marriage arrangement, but something about Akane always interested her (though<br/>she'd never admit it). She didn't know how Akane appealed to her, so she was always too<br/>confused or uncertain to make any real progress in their status as an engaged couple. (Well,<br/>they were engaged, alright: engaged in fights and arguments.)<p>It wasn't going to do any good weighing on her problems, so she sighed and slowly raised<br/>herself out of the water, her hair clinging further down her body as she did so. Stepping<br/>onto the tiled floor of the furoba, she once more gazed at her reflection in the mirror, and<br/>soon confronted it and the image it held. Trailing her fingers across its cool surface,<br/>appearing so slender and delicate on either side, she finally took the courage to admit that<br/>the body she saw in the mirror was really her own.<p>For so long she had ignored her female body, acting as though it didn't exist in some<br/>instances. Why be a girl, when you were born a guy? That seemed logical enough... for a<br/>while. But she had to admit that there were countless things that she had learned that she<br/>otherwise wouldn't have learned if she weren't a girl (including most of her most powerful<br/>techniques and skills), and for that she was grateful. There were other benefits worth<br/>mentioning, but now wasn't the time to: moving on with HER life was more important. But<br/>what to do; where to go?<p>She had no clue, but she was determined to walk the path that now lie ahead of her. Where it<br/>would take her, well, she'd just have to find out. It wouldn't be easy, she knew, but did she<br/>really have any other choice?<p>Retrieving a towel from the rack, she began to dry herself by patting around methodically,<br/>having learned a long time ago that it didn't feel pleasant rubbing herself as rough as she<br/>could as a guy. Far from being done, a problem arose: her hair was reintroducing water to<br/>her skin. Seeing the second towel on the rack (no doubt there for everyone but her father),<br/>she took it and wrapped up her hair with it, getting it out of the way for the time being.<p>After she wrapped the one towel around her torso, satisfied that she was adequately dry,<br/>she released her hair from its confines and it all, in one damp mass, fell heavily against her<br/>back (most of it covered by her towel). Pondering what to do with it, she decided to leave it<br/>braided as usual. Was it just a coincidence that she braided her hair in the past, too?<br/>Somehow, she doubted it: never had she cared for her hair before getting cursed; and after<br/>getting the dragon whisker, braiding it just seemed like a good idea (even though she could<br/>have kept her hair tied up in a ponytail).<p>Making good use of new memories, she dried her hair carefully with the second towel,<br/>taking precautions to prevent snarls. Once through, she picked up her hair tie from the floor<br/>and bound her hair with it after she was through plaiting it. Looking at herself in the mirror,<br/>her braid falling over her shoulder, she had to admit that she liked how she looked as she<br/>caressed her hand down the length of the vermillion rope that had once been her pigtail.<p>Shaking her head to clear her mind of such trivial thoughts, she faced the shouji, took a<br/>deep breath, and marched toward whatever fate had in store for her beyond it, the towel that<br/>she had used for her hair folded over one arm. Upon opening it, she quickly noticed the<br/>unexpected sight of another person in the bathroom with her: Nabiki.<p>Nabiki was leaning against the bathroom door, appearing smug, and making any<br/>conventional means of escape impossible. But what really caught her attention, was the<br/>familiar polaroid-type picture she held, in a hand that dangled from her loosely-crossed<br/>arms. Involuntarily, she gulped, very much alarmed by what she saw at the beginning of her<br/>new path. And, so, she stood, paralyzed by the dread that overcame her.<p>However, she did manage to stammer out: "Nuh... N-Nabiki...?" Surprised, she placed her<br/>free hand at the base of her throat, having heard a different, decidedly feminine voice<br/>emanating from it. Her voice; it sounded just like her guardian's!<p>"Seems that more than just your hair has changed." Nabiki commented calmly, showing a<br/>part of her hand (not her literal one) so Ranma had a clue about her advantage in their<br/>confrontation.<p>Not about to be intimidated by Nabiki, Ranma gathered her resolve and stood erect, firm,<br/>clearly conveying defiance from her stance and facial expression. It was a pity that her voice<br/>quavered ever-so-slightly as she spoke, ruining the effect. "What do you want, Nabiki?"<p>Shaking her head slightly, tsking as she did so, Nabiki regarded the now-long-haired<br/>redhead with a smirk before asking: "Oh? It isn't obvious?"<p>"Stop playin' around!" Ranma demanded, her already-frazzled nerves making it easier for her<br/>to become angry and to lose her composure. Calming down before continuing, though her<br/>voice remained stern and agitated, she suggested: "Just get to the point."<p>Removing all expression from her face, Nabiki unfolded her arms and raised the front of the<br/>picture she held into view. Almost immediately that feeling of dread returned to the forefront<br/>of Ranma's emotions at seeing a picture of herself crying into her hands in the furo, as she<br/>had been doing just moments ago.<p>Alternating her gaze between Nabiki's blank visage and the picture she held, Ranma<br/>contemplated taking the latter away. However, she soon realized that Nabiki wouldn't be<br/>stupid enough to practically hand her a picture without having copies already made and<br/>hidden somewhere. So, losing much of her confidence in the face of a lost battle, her posture<br/>slouched and her facade crestfallen, she knew how this meeting was going to proceed:<br/>Nabiki was going to hold the picture over her head until she did whatever Nabiki wanted her<br/>to do, until satisfied.<p>Knowing what was going to happen due to past experience, she somberly asked: "So...<br/>What is it this time?"<p>"Oh, I don't know." Nabiki replied nonchalantly, seeming to consider her options. "Who<br/>says I need to use you?"<p>Regarding Nabiki questioningly, events not playing out as they normally did, Ranma<br/>inquired: "What do you mean?"<p>Nabiki smirked as she waved the picture she held back and forth, doing the latter to attract<br/>Ranma's attention to it. "What could you do for me that is equal to the value of this?" She<br/>asked rhetorically, then explained: "Oh, I'm sure I can come up with several things for you to<br/>do; but I doubt you could earn enough money as I could make selling copies of this, here."<br/>She then turned the picture around so she could look at it herself, showing a considerable<br/>amount of interest in what she saw.<p>"But... But..." Ranma began to sputter, eyes wide with horror. "You... You wouldn't really do<br/>that, w-would you?" She didn't care all that much if embarrassing or racy pictures were sold<br/>of her, but one that would forever mar her reputation for being strong and confident? It was<br/>hard enough receiving respect as it was, so she didn't need the last thing buoying her image<br/>to plummet into the dirt, allowing others to take advantage of her susceptibility to verbal<br/>abuse.<p>"And miss out on all the profits I could make? What do you think?" Nabiki needled, smiling<br/>indulgently with a glint in her eye.<p>After studying Nabiki's face for a moment, Ranma bowed her head once the answer became<br/>more than abundantly clear to her. It upset her greatly, and her body trembled with feelings<br/>she didn't understand very well, having pretended she didn't have them for as long as she<br/>could remember. Said feelings seemed to dominate her so easily after the loss of her<br/>manhood, and all the other yet-to-happen, undesirable events only served to make her feel<br/>worse. This situation with Nabiki, however, was not one she had expected; but whether if it<br/>were or not, it still made her feel all that much worse than she had before. Could anything<br/>prove to degenerate things further?<p>Snapping her head back to an upright position, her distressed yet furious eyes locking onto<br/>Nabiki's, she shouted: "Fine!" She threw her towel in her direction, but it hit the wall beside<br/>her and slumped into the hamper below. She had meant to hit her current tormentor, but it<br/>seemed she wasn't focused enough to accomplish such a thing. Feeling the familiar moisture<br/>gathering along her eyelids (which soon coated her eyes after blinking), she turned her back<br/>on Nabiki so she couldn't see her tears, struggling to keep them at bay.<p>Her voice tremulous with emotion, however much she tried to conceal it, she quietly<br/>continued, saying: "I don't care what you do, anymore. If... If it makes you so happy making<br/>me so miserable, then go ahead and do it."<p>Ranma nearly leapt off the ground in surprise when a pair of arms encircled her waist, pulling<br/>her into the owner of said arms' body. Then, her body stiffened when she realized that she<br/>was being embraced, the contact with another person discomforting her greatly. But it was<br/>WHOM held her that perturbed and confused her more than anything, since the only<br/>person with her was Nabiki. Surely, she must be imagining things! As if to refute the<br/>conclusion she had come to, a familiar yet uncharacteristically soft voice said: "You really<br/>are an idiot, you know that?"<p>Ranma made no attempt to reply, too overwhelmed by shock, confusion, and by the fact that<br/>she couldn't divert her attention from the feeling of someone else being pressed against her.<p>Continuing, Nabiki, in the same tone, asked: "You're just going to give up? Just like that?"<p>"Wh-what are you talking about?" Ranma questioned, unable to grasp what Nabiki wanted<br/>from her. She was more concerned about what was going on, and whether it was a change<br/>for the better or not. Knowing Nabiki, she should expect the situation to get worse since she<br/>likes to tease her relentlessly.<p>Sighing, Nabiki released her hold on Ranma and turned her around to face her, leaving her<br/>hands on the smaller girl's shoulders. Her expression one of intense scrutiny (which Ranma<br/>shied away from with her eyes), she queried: "Aren't you going to put up a fight like you<br/>usually do? Where'd the confident jock go, the one who was too stupid to know what<br/>defeat was?"<p>"Hey!" Ranma countered unhappily, still capable of understanding an insult in her current<br/>mental disposition when she heard one.<p>Smiling, glad that she had elicited the reaction she wanted, Nabiki playfully stated: "So there<br/>IS some fight left in you."<p>Glaring at Nabiki, shrugging her hands off of her shoulders as she stepped back, Ranma was<br/>now angered more than anything else, now. Nabiki was just disorienting her in order to<br/>torment her some more in a new way. Frustration begetting tears anew, her voice low and<br/>quavering, she said: "Nabiki, I... I hate you." Then asked: "What in the hell did I ever do to<br/>you?"<p>Nabiki's face was impassive as she held out the picture she had taken, an obvious gesture<br/>that Ranma questioned with her eyes when she glanced at it, and doing the same as she<br/>returned her attention to the person who held it. "Now what're you tryin' to pull?" She<br/>accused, eyes narrowed.<p>"Destroy it." Nabiki simply instructed, voice even and unaffected.<p>"And what good will that do?" Ranma asked rhetorically. "I know you can make copies."<p>Doing well to hide her mirth, Nabiki replied: "This is an instant photograph."<p>Not understanding the significance of what kind of camera Nabiki used, Ranma asked: "So?"<p>"That means I have no negatives, which makes copying impossible."<p>"Like I'm supposed to believe that. You just want me to THINK you can't make copies."<p>"And my plan was working so well until you figured it out."<p>"Yeah; just like that time you tricked me into thinking you loved me."<p>...<p>Her plan working better than expected, Nabiki took the opening given to her and said: "That<br/>was all your doing."<p>"Huh? Wha...?" Ranma voiced in confusion, then figured out what was going on and<br/>crossed her arms in indignation, saying: "Oh, no; you can't blame me for that."<p>"Oh, yes; I certainly can." Nabiki replied, her tone and expression serious. Not allowing<br/>Ranma any room for a reply, she went on to explain: "You're the one who's too proud and<br/>insensitive to apologize."<p>"But I didn't do anything!" Ranma argued, aggravated. "And I didn't see you apologizing,<br/>either!"<p>"That's beyond the point." Nabiki stated calmly in response to the last comment, then<br/>asked: "Why? Are you saying you're always justified, and that you don't ever have to<br/>apologize?"<p>"Well, no, but..."<p>"Exactly." Nabiki interjected. "But what you don't get, is that sometimes it's better to<br/>apologize whether if it's your fault or not."<p>Ranma actually tried to understand her reasoning, but failed miserably. "I don't get it."<p>Sighing to show her exasperation, yet restraining herself from making any insults, Nabiki<br/>quickly inquired: "Look, you'd rather not have Akane upset with you, right?"<p>"Um, yeah..." Ranma answered hesitantly.<p>"Then why not apologize, especially when you know it's your fault?" Nabiki prodded.<p>Ranma didn't answer and lowered her head in shame while dropping her arms back against<br/>her flanks, knowing what her answer would be.<p>"That's right." Nabiki said knowingly. "Your pride is much too important to you, isn't it? All<br/>you ever think about is yourself, and how you portray yourself around others."<p>"That's not true!" Ranma protested, though the tinge of uncertainty in her voice hardly<br/>made it sound convincing.<p>"Really?" Nabiki replied in question, looking down at the girl before her speculatively.<br/>"Then who were you thinking of after Akane broke the engagement with you? If you were<br/>considering Akane's feelings, then you would have apologized to her, wouldn't you?"<p>"That's not fair..." Came Ranma's weak response.<p>"It's plenty fair." Nabiki quickly corrected. "While you were blissfully ignorant of my sister's<br/>hurt feelings, I did all the work getting you two back together."<p>Finding that to be outrageous, Ranma replied: "Wha...? Now way!"<p>Nabiki just smirked, causing Ranma to doubt herself. She knew that Nabiki never said<br/>anything in an argument without it being backed by the truth.<p>"Yes way." Nabiki replied, then divulged: "I was being intimate with you to make you<br/>uncomfortable, to make you want to be with Akane again. At the same time I tried to make<br/>Akane jealous, jealous enough to openly admit wanting you back. But you hurt her feelings<br/>again when you 'apologized', and she gave up on you since you weren't being serious."<br/>Seeing that Ranma was too surprised to make an immediate response, she added: "And<br/>haven't you ever wondered WHY Akane was at the appointed spot you and me were to<br/>meet for our date?"<p>Ranma regarded her questioningly for a second, then her eyes widened in realization.<br/>"You...?" She blurted out in surprise, having always thought Nabiki to be anything but kind.<p>Nodding, Nabiki then went on to explain: "And if you hadn't tried to avenge your stupid,<br/>hurt pride, then you would have met Akane and given her the flowers under better<br/>circumstances, and perhaps not even bother to mention who you were really there for. You<br/>two MIGHT have had a good time together."<p>Even though Ranma felt guilty, she still, though weakly, argued: "But how was I supposed<br/>to know that you set Akane up with me?"<p>"You weren't." Nabiki replied easily. "That's why it's called a surprise."<p>Having run out of fuel to argue with Nabiki, knowing it'd be futile, Ranma sighed in defeat<br/>and once again returned her attention to the picture Nabiki STILL held out to her. Finding<br/>something odd about it, she asked: "So... Nabiki... If you REALLY have only one picture of<br/>me... And we both know it'd make you alot of money... Why do you want me to destroy it?"<p>Smiling slightly, Nabiki revealed: "I don't need it."<p>"What do you mean?" Ranma questioned, once again being confused by Nabiki.<p>"What I mean," Nabiki began, taking on an air of solemnness. "Is exactly what I said." More<br/>than willing to explain, she added: "I came here to take pictures of you, yes; but I took one,<br/>solitary picture after witnessing what had transpired in there." She nodded almost<br/>imperceptibly towards the furoba.<p>Becoming nervous in response to Nabiki's attitude, wondering what was going on, she<br/>asked: "Why?"<p>"To prove a point." Nabiki answered. So saying, she continued before Ranma could<br/>interrupt her with another question. "If you hadn't acted so tough, showing yourself as<br/>being such an arrogant jerk who couldn't express his feelings if his life depended on it and<br/>thoughtlessly said whatever came to mind, then this (she raised the picture up to Ranma's<br/>eye level) wouldn't threaten you."<p>Seeing that Ranma was unable to reply, obviously due to shock, she said: "If you had<br/>expressed yourself more openly and honestly, and not prove how great you were at<br/>everything, then no one would resent you enough to take any interest in this picture at all."<p>"Th-they... resent me...?" Ranma asked, her voice cracking and eyes wide in disbelief. That<br/>couldn't be true, could it? Could it! Nabiki had to be joking!<p>Allowing some sympathy to show across her visage and slip into her voice, Nabiki replied:<br/>"They do, but needing to ask that just shows how little you bother to get to know anyone.<br/>Do you even know why Hiroshi and Daisuke are the only ones in the school who associate<br/>with you?"<p>Ranma was afraid to answer, so didn't. She had an inkling, now, that her two friends weren't<br/>the most popular in school, and hadn't thought her worthy of associating with them because<br/>she was popular, too.<p>"I see you're figuring it out." Nabiki observed sadly, watching as Ranma gradually appeared<br/>to be more and more disconsolate.<p>Shaking her head furiously, Ranma tried to convince herself that everything was false, that<br/>she hadn't THOUGHT everyone envied her, but KNEW. Of course, that only made her<br/>realize that she really was deserving of their hate if she thought like that. Why had it taken<br/>so long to put the pieces together when it was so apparent? But it was just as well, wasn't<br/>it? She was always more concerned about herself and making an image she was sure<br/>everyone found appealing, yet only demonstrated that she was an arrogant, self-centered<br/>idiot trying to vie for everyone's attention by winning all her challenges to show how<br/>indomitable she was.<p>Feeling her tears welling up again, she turned away from Nabiki, not wanting her to see<br/>them. However, she was whirled back around by her, who glared at her reproachfully as she<br/>grasped her shoulders firmly. "You still don't get it, do you?"<p>Ranma turned her head away and lowered it so her bangs hid her face, ashamed to show her<br/>tears to anyone, especially Nabiki. And why not? She was the one responsible for most of<br/>the gossip and rumors, and especially for spreading truthful information that embarrassed or<br/>humiliated someone, among other such things.<p>Sighing, Nabiki shook her head in disappointment before saying: "This is one of your<br/>biggest problems, you know." Getting no response, she decided to ask: "Tell me, Ranma;<br/>when you find something humorous, you laugh, right?" Receiving a curt nod, she ventured:<br/>"And when you eat Akane's food, you bemoan your existence, right?" Another nod, though<br/>it was a bit belated. "So, why don't you cry when you're sad?" She questioned, trying to<br/>reason with the girl within her possession.<p>"I just did, didn't I?" Ranma questioned weakly, sniffling, still trying to withhold her tears<br/>from flowing forth after Nabiki shattered the reality she had been living in while introducing<br/>her to the one everyone else resided.<p>"You thought you were alone." Nabiki reminded her, then clarified: "You express yourself<br/>around others so long as you don't appear weak."<p>"That's what I've always done..." Ranma replied in her defense, though without much heart.<p>"I don't care about that." Nabiki stated before removing her hands from Ranma's shoulders,<br/>one hand tilting her head up by the chin and the other holding the picture in her direct line<br/>of sight. "There's always room for change. I want to be able to take a picture like this one, of<br/>you being honest, tender and vulnerable, and feel sympathetic; not delighted."<p>Looking over the picture in front of her, regarding Nabiki with a hurt expression etched<br/>across her face, Ranma asked: "You like seeing me like that?"<p>"Not in the way you think." She answered, smiling, liking the look of confusion on her<br/>recipient's face. "I'm glad to finally see your facade collapse. I was beginning to lose hope<br/>there for a while, thinking that, perhaps, nothing I could ever do would bring the stubborn<br/>idiot down."<p>Ranma's brows furrowed as she tried to understand what she had just been told. When she<br/>did, finally, understand, she glared at Nabiki and slapped away the hand that was under her<br/>chin, exclaiming: "You mean, you put me through all that hell just to see me crying in utter<br/>defeat!"<p>"You're blaming ME for YOU being so stubborn?" Nabiki coolly inquired in reply, crossing<br/>her arms defensively in response to the implication.<p>Having been ready to reply, Ranma's mouth quickly flew open, then closed when she found<br/>herself without an answer (a practical answer, anyway).<p>"That's right." Nabiki spoke, once again tasting victory. "You're the one who kept raising<br/>the stakes by not admitting defeat. All you had to do was yield and show that you were<br/>human like everyone else, but instead allowed me to blackmail you so the 'incriminating'<br/>evidence didn't get out."<p>"But none of that would've happened in the first place if you didn't challenge me!" Ranma<br/>argued, though some of her fire was already flickering away: she had a feeling that Nabiki<br/>had an incontestable response ready for her.<p>"How else do you expect to learn a lesson?" Nabiki queried, then challenged: "What, you<br/>expect to learn it without first experiencing the reason as to why you need to understand the<br/>lesson in the first place?"<p>Once again being left speechless, Ranma lowered her eyes in defeat, unable to meet Nabiki's<br/>gaze.<p>Nodding faintly, Nabiki stated: "You and I both know that it takes training to do what we do<br/>best. You may surpass me by far in strength and physical skill because of your training trip,<br/>but you've yet to win a battle of wits against me because I trained my mental faculties."<br/>Wanting to justify her actions, she added: "I was merely trying to show you how to be more<br/>socially accepted by threatening your perceived image, hoping you'd realize that the more<br/>defensive you became, the more ground you actually lost."<p>"A lose-to-win situation..." Ranma whispered in understanding, glancing up at Nabiki once<br/>more.<p>"But you never noticed how everyone resented you more as time went on, or somehow<br/>confused it with something else." Nabiki stated, though left it open for question as subtly as<br/>possible, not wanting Ranma to know she wasn't sure which was the case.<p>"The latter." Ranma helpfully supplied in a dejected tone, admitting: "I thought everyone<br/>just envied me..."<p>"Well, now who's the wiser, eh?" Nabiki commented with a lopsided smile.<p>Ranma couldn't help looking at Nabiki in a whole different light despite all the grief she had<br/>put her through. Throughout most of the time she knew her, she had been making her life<br/>miserable, never knowing why or if she had wronged her somehow. And now she finds out<br/>that Nabiki had challenged her using methods she wouldn't have disagreed with if she had<br/>been aware of them, knowing that she would have, out of pride, accepted the challenge in<br/>whatever way it was presented. Still, that didn't make her feel any better about being<br/>resented, and it certainly didn't make a difference with her upcoming confrontation with her<br/>mother.<p>Once again gesturing for Ranma to take the picture, Nabiki asked: "At any rate, are you<br/>going to destroy this, or not?"<p>Examining the picture in Nabiki's hand, Ranma was tempted to take it and tear it to shreds.<br/>Well, more like burn it up with her ki; though it really didn't matter which since its<br/>destruction was the ultimate goal. Her hand reached out for it, but she hesitated and glanced<br/>up at Nabiki, who regarded her with a raised eyebrow. "Why am I hesitating?" She<br/>wondered in thought, then returned her gaze to the picture before her. "And why does<br/>Nabiki want ME to destroy it, when she's just as capable?"<p>It didn't make much sense since Nabiki didn't seem to have any interest in the picture<br/>whatsoever, so she must be up to something again. Surprisingly, the answer presented itself<br/>to her faster than she expected, as a new memory played out in her mind's eye...<p>The hut was small and simple, but was nevertheless a sacred shrine of the Amazons. It was<br/>built no differently than most of the homes in the village, having logs for walls and thatch<br/>roofing.<p>Inside, the only light source was from a single candle, which was held by the Amazon's<br/>matriarch. The light it provided was not much, but it was enough to reveal a head-sized urn,<br/>as well as the shoulder-height crate it was set upon.<p>Well, shoulder-height to five-year-old Tao hua, who stood nervously with knife in hand<br/>while wearing her ceremonial, silken robe of white (the color used in honor of the moon). Her<br/>robe matched that of the matriarch's in color, although the symbols differentiated from each<br/>other: front and back, she had a crescent-shaped bow with a silver arrow notched and ready<br/>to soar; the matriarch, on the other hand, wore the quarter-divided circle that represented<br/>the symbol for the Earth. Her symbol, the bow and arrow, was worn by every young<br/>Amazon during the "ceremony of the new moon", which was their initiation into the training<br/>regimen for huntresses and warriors. The matriarch's symbol was worn as a complement, to<br/>ascertain the deities that they would care and respect the land they fought, cultivated, and<br/>hunted upon: all would be done per necessity. These same ceremonial robes would be worn<br/>again during the "coming of age" ceremony, when her ten cycles of training were completed<br/>and she was considered a true Amazon warrior and huntress (though her robe would be<br/>larger to fit her older frame).<p>"Tao hua." The matriarch addressed solemnly, her serious visage disquieting the small girl.<br/>It may not have been so bad if she weren't so wrinkly, but that couldn't be helped<br/>considering her age. Even so, her long, snow-white hair and tall, frail body would have<br/>reminded the small girl of a ghoul in the flickering illumination of the candlelight either way.<p>"Y-yes, honored elder?" She managed to reply, though without much courage. This<br/>ceremony frightened her since her mother told her horror stories about it all the time. The<br/>mothers of her Amazon sisters did the very same, to those around her age that haven't<br/>undergone the ceremony. Those that have underwent the ceremony retold similar tales of<br/>equal horror.<p>What was involved in the ceremony, you ask? Well, in all the stories there was one<br/>constant: you WILL place your hand inside the magic urn. However, after that, everything<br/>differed. Most everyone who had experienced the ceremony said that there was a terrible<br/>beast, venomous creature, or even a flesh-consuming flame inside the urn. It was a test, and<br/>all you had for help were your wits and a small knife. Being five-years-old, no Amazon had<br/>any experience with weapons at that age, and so having a knife reassured them little; and<br/>she was no exception. Still, she would do her best to prove herself an Amazon worthy of<br/>being a huntress and warrior.<p>"Stand upon the stool and reach your hand into the urn." The matriarch directed. "Fear not<br/>and defeat the hidden enemy that awaits you."<p>Gulping, Tao hua did as she was instructed and stepped onto the stool that was hidden in<br/>the shadow of the crate, and almost fell from it due to her trepidation. Then, after a moment<br/>of hesitation, she hoisted her upper body with one arm as she leaned forward and slowly<br/>dipped her knife-wielding hand inside the depths of the urn.<p>Unknown to the little girl (whose attention was focused on the safety of her hand), the<br/>matriarch scuffed her foot along the wooden floor twice. No sooner had she completed the<br/>action, did the young Amazon with fiery locks yelp in surprise and fright when something<br/>grabbed ahold of her wrist and began pulling her arm well past the limit of the urn's bottom<br/>(which only frightened her more). "No! No! Let go! Let go!" She cried out as she tried to<br/>pull back, tears spilling from her eyes. "I don't want to be pulled in!"<p>After a moment of struggling, she was finally let go once she lost hold of her knife, and fell<br/>back into the awaiting arms of the matriarch (who had swiftly moved to catch her). Once<br/>she was set on the ground, her legs trembling from her ordeal, the matriarch took the urn and<br/>presented it to the her. Flinching at the sight of it, she took it and examined it, puzzled when<br/>she found the urn bottomless.<p>Looking up at the matriarch (who stood behind her), she, her voice shaking, asked:<br/>"Wh-where's the b-bottom?"<p>Seeing the matriarch point to the top of the crate in response, she hesitantly decided to<br/>investigate and satisfy her curiosity. Once she stood upon the stool once again, (which she<br/>could now see due to the candle's new position), she gasped when she found a hole where<br/>the urn used to be. Then, frightened by the sudden movement of the crate, she dashed over<br/>to the matriarch and hugged her leg from behind for protection.<p>From within the crate, another Amazon moved it onto its side so she could stand up and<br/>reveal herself. She was fairly tall, taller than the matriarch, with violet hair braided down the<br/>length of her back, and with fuchsia-colored eyes that were, at the moment, disarming and<br/>kind. Her attire was not special, wearing something casual as a tunic and a straight-falling<br/>skirt tied at the waist with a cord of hemp. Being the granddaughter of the matriarch,<br/>Tao hua knew this Amazon VERY well. "Mommy...?" She questioned, shocked by this<br/>revelation.<p>"Yes, it's me, dear." The mother admitted, trying her best to hide her guilt. No mother<br/>enjoyed doing this to their daughters, but it was an important lesson and cornerstone in<br/>their development as huntresses and warriors. It was the most effective and safest method<br/>of guaranteeing a finely-trained and skillful Amazon in both the short and long term.<p>Abandoning her grandmother, Tao hua rushed up to her mother and exclaimed: "Mommy!"<br/>Said mother caught and raised her daughter to her bosom, and began to console her<br/>sobbing child with words and gentle strokes.<p>It was amazing how such a short and simple ceremony could prepare practically any<br/>Amazon for their training, and how many important lessons could be learned by applying<br/>the method used to initiate them into the ten-cycle-long regimen.<p>First and foremost, it teaches one to be fearless; not arrogant or over-confident, but fearless.<br/>If you feel dread, then you have already been considered defeated. For, you see, even<br/>something as harmless as a mother could catch you off guard and kill you if you allow fear<br/>to cripple you beforehand. However, should you die without giving in to fear, then you<br/>have not been defeated since you have not given up. This helped those face hidden<br/>opponents and wild beasts, and opponents that hid their true strength or were making their<br/>movements random and otherwise unreadable, so as to accomplish something underhanded.<br/>Overall, it teaches one to be alert and aware of their surroundings, to react instantly without<br/>delay.<p>Second, it teaches one to not enter battle with shafts flying; or so they said back in the old<br/>days. That's why the matriarch had scuffed her feet twice, warning her mother that she (back<br/>then) had entered the urn with her most effective defense against whatever was inside the<br/>urn. If it isn't necessary, then don't flaunt your most effective skills. Information has many<br/>mediums with which it uses to travel, and the exhibition of one's best skills would only be<br/>detrimental if another opponent learns of them and, eventually, defeats you (even if they<br/>were weaker and lacking in skill; it can and has been done).<p>Finally, it teaches one that training can be found in even the most unconventional ways.<br/>More importantly, it was finding a way to train that would be just as beneficial as the<br/>methods used before it, only safer and, perhaps, even quicker.<p>Essentially, if she had trained with the Amazons, then she would have avoided facing one<br/>fear at a time as her father tossed her into training and expected her to deal with it. The<br/>Neko-ken training was a good example of how her father trained her normally, but it was the<br/>only training that caused her to absolutely dread something with every fiber of her body.<p>Glancing back up at Nabiki, she couldn't help smiling slightly as she declared: "I won't<br/>destroy it."<p>"So, you want me to do it?" Nabiki queried, her face void of any tale-telling expression. She<br/>didn't want to reveal how she felt about it, almost by reflex.<p>"Nope." Ranma replied easily, then crossed her arms confidently and added: "In fact, you<br/>can sell it 'round to whomever wants to see it."<p>Still straight-faced, Nabiki stated: "That's just what I'll do, you know." Not getting a<br/>negative reaction, she smiled in satisfaction and pulled the now-surprised redhead into an<br/>embrace. "I'm so proud of you." She told her sincerely.<p>Ranma didn't know how to respond, so kept quiet. Okay, so maybe it had something to do<br/>with her head being stuffed between the two mounds on Nabiki's chest, but was that really<br/>important?<p>After a moment, Nabiki leaned back and looked down at Ranma, asking: "Say, does that<br/>mean I can sell that picture I took of you when I caught you crossdressing?"<p>Bearing a sweat drop behind her head and an odd look on her face due to exasperation,<br/>Ranma awkwardly replied: "Um... Sure. Why not?" Man, Nabiki was going to be reeling in<br/>the dough when school reopened in a week; that was for certain.<p>As for the picture Nabiki mentioned... Well, she had been curious and finally gathered the<br/>nerve to wear feminine undergarments one day. It wasn't long after she had been dressed in<br/>Akane's pink overalls and long-sleeved, black shirt, deciding that clothing was clothing and<br/>girls did seem to have more than enough of it. The only embarrassing part about that time at<br/>present, is that it had been Nabiki's underwear that she had borrowed. She didn't choose<br/>Akane's since hers were too small (obviously), and she hadn't chosen Kasumi's because she<br/>respected her more than the others; so she was left with Nabiki, whose bra size just<br/>happened to fit her at the time. And it was during that time that she had learned to put on a<br/>brassiere properly, which helped her to do so when she had to take provocative pictures of<br/>herself in order to get Happosai to release his aura, so she could then defeat him with the<br/>hiryu shoten ha.<p>"Great!" Nabiki responded happily, appreciatively. "Now, are you even the least bit curious<br/>as to WHY I sell pictures of you?" She asked, breaking her embrace and stepping back, her<br/>expression lost once more behind a mask.<p>"To make money?" Ranma answered as innocently as ever.<p>Sighing and closing her eyes, Nabiki shook her head with disappointment. "Be patient." She<br/>told herself in thought. Then, reopening her eyes, she asked: "And why do I need money?"<p>Ranma tilted her head thoughtfully, index finger tapping her bottom lip as she considered<br/>her answer. Smiling despite herself, she asked: "To rule the world?"<p>"Nope." Nabiki answered, grinning. "That's the third stage of my plan."<p>Blinking while regarding Nabiki incredulously, Ranma asked: "Are you serious?"<p>"Maybe." Nabiki replied cryptically, then became serious again, saying: "But that's not<br/>important." Ranma wondered what she was missing, when Nabiki asked: "Do you know<br/>where any of the money I make goes?"<p>Ranma gave her answer with a quiet shake of her head. What was she going to reveal to her,<br/>now; that she donated to charities? Now THAT would be a surprise!<p>Shaking her head herself, wondering how someone could be so dense, Nabiki said: "It goes<br/>towards the bills, the food, the repairs..." Ranma was slack-jawed as she continued. "And<br/>our college intuition."<p>"'O-our?'" Ranma repeated in question, staring at Nabiki in utter shock. Could it be true?<br/>Well, now that it was brought to her attention, she didn't see where else the money could<br/>come from. Her father had long since quit his job as doctor Tofu's assistant, and no one else<br/>worked as far as she knew... It was so embarrassing for not noticing before, otherwise she<br/>would have helped Nabiki by posing for photographs of her own free will, or done<br/>something else to help out. Nabiki must really consider her an idiot after not realizing for so<br/>long. Such thoughts made her bow her head, too ashamed to show her face.<p>"Of course." Nabiki admitted, smiling with some amusement. "Even if you're not going to be<br/>my brother-in-law anymore, I still hope to see you more intelligent one day."<p>"Hey..." Ranma voiced threateningly, glaring at Nabiki in response to her insult. Soon,<br/>however, she just smiled and shook her head, amazed at how she now saw Nabiki (it was<br/>almost like she had been replaced by a good twin instead of the other way around). How<br/>much more would things change? It was as if her whole world were crumbling and turning<br/>upside down at the same time.<p>"But why is Nabiki revealing all this to me all of a sudden?" Ranma suddenly wondered as<br/>she regarded the person in question. The Nabiki she knew a few moments ago just didn't<br/>exist anymore, having completely changed into this new Nabiki. It wasn't a bad thing (that<br/>was for sure), but it was odd how she didn't find out one aspect at a time over the course<br/>of... Well, however long it would have taken her to find out. Instead, Nabiki seemed to be<br/>displaying all this information here and now; and for free, no less!<p>Finding that her curiosity was getting the better of her, she couldn't resist uttering: "Um,<br/>Nabiki?"<p>"Yes?" Nabiki replied, amused as she watched Ranma shuffle around uncomfortably. She<br/>suspected that she had caught on to what she was doing... to some degree. You see, it<br/>seemed as if Ranma's brain only worked well during physical conflict, so she was out of her<br/>element and unlikely to put all the major pieces of the puzzle together. In a battle, however,<br/>Ranma was simply brilliant; strange at times, but brilliant nonetheless.<p>"Why?" Ranma inquired, her eyes searching Nabiki's tentatively. "Why are you showing all<br/>this to me now?"<p>"You really don't know?" Nabiki counter-questioned, giving the short-statured girl before<br/>her a chance to work it all out herself so she didn't have to explain.<p>Receiving a negative in the form of a shaking head, Nabiki sighed and shook her own head,<br/>wondering why she ever gives Ranma the benefit of the doubt half the time. Not about to<br/>waste any more time, she said: "Well, I don't know how you locked your curse or why your<br/>hair lengthened and your voice changed, but the simple fact of the matter is this: you can't<br/>change back."<p>Ranma nodded and left her head bowed, becoming subdued after being reminded of her<br/>situation. Somehow (and she really didn't know how), talking to Nabiki had distracted her<br/>and calmed her for a moment; not long, but it was still noticeable. She couldn't remember<br/>that happening before.<p>"And we all know what that entails, don't we?" Nabiki continued, receiving another nod for<br/>an answer. Softening her voice while looking sympathetic, she revealed: "So, in case the<br/>worst scenario plays out, I wanted you to know what I've been doing. I didn't want you to...<br/>die, thinking I was some kind of horrible monster. But if your mother doesn't go through<br/>carrying out the seppuku, then I'd like to be friends."<p>Raising her head as if startled, Ranma regarded Nabiki in wide-eyed disbelief. Unable to<br/>collect all her bearings, she was only able to stammer out: "R-r-really?"<p>"Really." Nabiki conceded, smiling. "With the arranged marriage out of the way and my<br/>lesson FINALLY over, what's to stop me now?"<p>Ranma couldn't believe it; Nabiki wanted to be her friend! And it sounded like she had<br/>wanted to be for some time now! There was no describing the feelings she felt welling up in<br/>her bosom, as her heart pounded wildly with enthusiastic glee! But it wasn't to last as her<br/>last memory of such an offer quickly dampered whatever good mood she had briefly been in.<br/>Maybe Nabiki wouldn't be like Akane and hate her for being different (or being herself), but<br/>that wasn't what concerned her. What DID, was the pledge of honor to unite the schools<br/>that reminded her of the pledge to commit seppuku if she weren't considered a man to her<br/>mother, which in turn reminded her that she may not live to enjoy a friendship with the<br/>middle Tendo daughter.<p>"What's wrong?" Nabiki asked with concern, seeing her new friend overcome by<br/>depression after having been beaming with delight for mere seconds; it hardly seemed fair to<br/>see it robbed from her so soon.<p>"We can only be friends 'IF' I don't have to commit seppuku..." Ranma stated quietly, sadly,<br/>her eyes downcast.<p>Nabiki took Ranma's hands (much to her surprise and discomfort) and held them between<br/>her own, trying to reassure her further as she inquired: "What are you talking about? We're<br/>friends NOW, aren't we?"<p>"Yeah; but how does that matter if I'm going to die soon, anyway?" Ranma answered<br/>sullenly, though was beginning to take some comfort in having her hands held as they were.<p>Squeezing the hands she held a bit more firmly, Nabiki sternly replied: "Because the Ranma I<br/>know wouldn't give up. So, what's it going to be: are we friends until the bitter end, or are<br/>you a stranger resigning yourself to the gallows?"<p>It was unbelievable how right Nabiki was, and always seemed to be. Ranma felt so stupid for<br/>letting herself become crippled by fear, especially after a part of her awakening memories<br/>helped her to understand that she had nothing to fear when it came to pictures that revealed<br/>her true self, or even moments when she wasn't. Being fearless had proven to save her life a<br/>multitude of times in her past existence, so why not here and now, where it had saved her<br/>skin just as many a time?<p>Her spirits revived and eyes wrinkled with gratitude as she raised them to meet Nabiki's,<br/>Ranma, in a more lively tone, admitted: "You're right, Nabiki: Ranma wouldn't give up."<p>"Good." Nabiki commented, mentally relieved. "Now, I have one last issue to take care of:<br/>how did you manage to get into this mess in the first place?"<p>Feeling a little sheepish at first, knowing how often she got herself into trouble, Ranma<br/>lowered her eyes. Then, remembering how it all came about subdued her in thought, as she<br/>worked out all the details about the senshi that she knew of. It seemed as if Ryoga knew<br/>them, but he acted as though they were common knowledge and not some rare occurrence<br/>like one of those passing comets she had heard about once. Speaking of comets, all the<br/>senshi seemed to refer to themselves by their respective celestial object. So, were they like<br/>her; where they lived normal (not compared to herself) lives outside of being a senshi,<br/>revealing not their identity by mentioning only their title as a senshi? That seemed so, so<br/>then it would only be sensible to consider her status as a senshi as a secret.<p>Trying to convey her forgiveness through her eyes, Ranma apologetically replied: "I'm<br/>sorry, Nabiki, but I think that'll have to remain a secret." Seeing that Nabiki didn't seem very<br/>thrilled to hear that, she quickly added: "I would if I could, but others that have gone<br/>through the same thing as me haven't spoken of it, either, I'm sure." Not that she knew how<br/>appealing a bunch of fighting cheerleaders would be to the populace, and whether or not<br/>any attention would be good attention. Still, that certain something told her that "Ranma"<br/>and "Dark side of the moon" should remain separate identities: that new instinctual part of<br/>her that she had inherited after being inducted into the ranks of the senshi.<p>"Oh, alright." Nabiki sighed with obvious disappointment, then gave Ranma a heartfelt hug.<br/>Ranma wasn't sure what to do, but slowly, tentatively, she wrapped Nabiki in her arms, as<br/>well. Not that she was going to admit it aloud, she was beginning to like being hugged<br/>(by someone who cared about her, anyway).<p>After breaking away, Nabiki smiled warmly as she perched her hands on Ranma's shoulders,<br/>saying: "Now, go get dressed and talk to Akane about what has happened." Catching the<br/>obvious buildup of disagreement on the face before her, she sternly added this before<br/>Ranma could interject: "You WILL tell her, because she deserves to know sooner than<br/>later." Not leaving any room to brook an argument (though Ranma seemed to have been<br/>convinced that she was right), she continued with what she had planned to say. "I'll inform<br/>Kasumi about what has happened. I'm not about to let you confront your mother without<br/>our support."<p>"Y-you'd do that?" Ranma responded, her eyes wide in astonishment, touched. With them<br/>helping, she felt as if she actually had a chance of avoiding seppuku! And for some odd<br/>reason she felt like crying, even though she knew that she was getting assistance from<br/>someone who really wanted to help her. Acting on impulse, she swung her arms around<br/>Nabiki's waist and squeezed with all the feeling she could muster to convey her gratitude,<br/>even as she exclaimed: "Thank you so much!"<p>It seemed that she was squeezing Nabiki with a bit TOO much fervor, whose breath was lost<br/>to her as her eyes popped out of her sockets and her arms flailed up and down feverishly.<br/>Noticing the movement of Nabiki's arms, Ranma looked up to find the purplish-hued face of<br/>her new friend. Letting go of Nabiki faster than you can say "aiyaa", she began to apologize<br/>profusely as Nabiki panted and tried to regain her composure.<p>Once she did, she held up her hand, gesturing for Ranma to silence herself (which she did,<br/>though not without looking ashamed), and said: "Enough! I'm okay." Ranma was about to<br/>make sure, but Nabiki knew what to expect and narrowed her eyes, warning her not to do so.<p>Certain that her redheaded friend wasn't going to say anything, she calmly said: "Don't<br/>worry about me, okay? Just do what I've planned." Then she decided to explain why, just to<br/>give her a better incentive to listen and follow through with what she had planned. "Your<br/>mother will not fail to notice your changes or the fact that you won't be seen male, so it's<br/>best to confront her when you're ready for her, not when she's ready to question you."<p>"You're right." Ranma acknowledged, gathering her resolve for what she knew had to be<br/>done, straightening her posture and setting an expression of determination on her face as<br/>she did so.<p>And with that said and done, she hugged Nabiki much more gently than before, thanked<br/>her again, then strode around and away from her. As she did, she reviewed what had<br/>happened with Nabiki, and wondered how else her life was going to change in ways that<br/>would surprise her. At least, in this case, it was for the better... Though she was afraid she<br/>had just jinxed herself.<p>Once Ranma closed the door behind herself, Nabiki sighed and shook her head, relieved to<br/>have finally gotten that over with. Not that she didn't want to do it (and would in fact do it<br/>again), she just wasn't one for being patient, and Ranma certainly knew how to draw things<br/>out (even if she didn't realize it).<p>"Still," She began in thought, smiling. "I've finally had the opportunity to be friends with<br/>him... her." Which she had been wanting to do since she found out about her curse.<br/>However, since she was not interested in marriage, she didn't want to become too friendly<br/>and have the fathers notice, who would then switch the marriage to a more "agreeable"<br/>daughter.<p>But she did find a way to make it impossible for Ranma to even attempt being friendly with<br/>her, so she didn't have to try and come up with excuses as to why she disliked her. That's<br/>why she always tried to tell her younger sister that nothing was wrong with her fiance, yet<br/>would never be taken seriously about it, as though she were joking.<p>She wasn't joking, of course. There was something special about Ranma that she had<br/>noticed after the first few days of her stay, and she had been intent on figuring out what it<br/>was. Mysteries interested her, you see; and Ranma's dual nature was quite the mystery to<br/>her after some period of examination.<p>What dual nature, you ask? Well, Ranma seemed rather modest and quiet at first, then<br/>showed that she could be the exact opposite by being arrogant, rude and boisterous. Not<br/>that she blamed her for reacting the way she did to Akane's ill treatment (to a guest, no less),<br/>but she had never known anyone to just "turn off" one attitude and "switch on" another.<br/>The one aspect about Ranma that never changed was her intelligence, which was sorely<br/>lacking.<p>Sure, anyone could act, but what reason would Ranma have to act modest and shy if the<br/>opposite personality was her true and only one? Right; if she was indeed like that, then she<br/>wouldn't feel the need to pretend being nice or gracious. What tells her that there is, indeed,<br/>another side to Ranma, is that she does try to act nice sometimes, and is actually selfless<br/>when she needs to be (even when she normally wouldn't want to be). How else do you<br/>explain the time she was protected by her from the other fiance (Ukyo), want-to-be fiance<br/>(Kodachi), and Amazon wife (Shampoo), when she had angered and confused her so utterly<br/>around that time?<p>That's why she has wanted to be her friend for so long, because it would be easier to<br/>understand her if she were more open to express herself to someone she could trust.<br/>Besides, having half of her mind made up to become a psychiatrist, she decided that it<br/>would both be good practice and worth writing a ground-breaking book about. Maybe the<br/>critics and others in her profession wouldn't take her seriously and outright dissent her<br/>study on a person who could actually switch between sexes by magic, but it'd be funny to<br/>be one of the very few people to know the truth despite it being available for the world to<br/>read.<p>Remembering what she had to do at the here and now, she made her way into the furoba to<br/>put away the bathing supplies Ranma had forgotten about. She had noticed shortly after the<br/>now-permanent girl had stepped out from there and into the bathroom, but hadn't said<br/>anything about it since there were more important things to worry about. And after cleaning<br/>up, she would go directly to Kasumi and get her up to speed on the situation. Hopefully,<br/>Ranma won't fail in telling Akane what she needed to know; though she had the feeling that<br/>she didn't need to worry.<p>Meanwhile...<p>Paramedics, fireman, police and reporters had overrun the scene where the latest fight of the<br/>senshi had taken place. A cleanup crew was there, too, of course; but there was no room for<br/>them to work. They had to wait until all the injured and dead were either receiving medical<br/>attention or being sent to the morgue, respectively, anyway. Also, so as to not be<br/>unprofessional, the police were gathering evidence to make sure that none of the injured or<br/>deceased were in such conditions because of another human being.<p>Early on in the search for those who could be buried under rubble, a fireman hailed a pair of<br/>paramedics over to a young man he had found within a hole in a restaurant's building. As<br/>the fireman continued his search, all he told the paramedics was that he had "found a live<br/>one."<p>The paramedics had, at first, assumed that the young man had been badly injured since they<br/>had also assumed that he had been knocked through the wall. However, even a brief<br/>inspection showed that the young man wasn't injured at all, and that there was only some<br/>blood loss from the nose. Other than that nothing seemed wrong, though it was strange to<br/>find him in the women's restroom.<p>Beside them and a short distance away, one of the cameraman who was ordered to film as<br/>many scenes of the dead and injured as possible without needing his reporter for<br/>commentary, focused on them as they began to cut away the straps of the unconscious<br/>man's backpack. Once through, they moved to lift the man onto the stretcher, taking all<br/>necessary precautions in the case that there were internal injuries they couldn't readily find<br/>without the right equipment.<p>After setting the young man onto the stretcher, they were startled when said young man<br/>bolted into an upright position, who then looked about himself wildly before asking:<br/>"Wh-where am I? What's going on?"<p>The cameraman began to wave at his reporter, signaling her over since he thought he had<br/>caught something interesting. She soon noticed him and abandoned her questioning of one<br/>of the witnesses, whom she'd most likely return to in order to get her to retell all the<br/>interesting details concerning the fight on camera. Another person on their crew was filming<br/>live, so she was left to gather information and whatever else that may be interesting that her<br/>fellow reporter wasn't able to catch.<p>"Hold on, son." One of the paramedics ordered, needing to do some questioning of his own.<br/>"Do you know who you are?"<p>Ryoga gave him an odd look, thinking the question silly. "Of course I do. I'm Hibiki Ryoga!"<p>"Are you having trouble remembering anything?" The other paramedic inquired.<p>"I'm fine, damn it!" Ryoga retorted impatiently, quickly becoming irritated. He had a certain<br/>pigtailed martial artist to find and had no time for idle chitchat, so he leapt to his feet and<br/>picked up his backpack, preparing to take his leave of the place.<p>Worried that this "Ryoga" could very well be injured without knowing it, the first paramedic<br/>quickly warned: "You could be hurt, so please lie back down!" The second paramedic<br/>added: "You need to be checked at the hospital to make sure everything's alright."<p>Turning around swiftly to glare at the two persistent paramedics as he held his backpack<br/>over his shoulder by one strap, he emphatically said: "Would you give it a rest, already! All<br/>I did was..." He trailed off, suddenly realizing what he was about to admit. Thankfully, he<br/>caught himself just in time to avoid embarrassing himself.<p>Unfortunately, however, the paramedics wanted to know what happened to him if he knew:<br/>that way they could leave him be if it wasn't anything worth attending to (if they believed<br/>him, anyway). "What?" The second paramedic questioned. "All you did was...?"<p>They got a reply from him, but it was muttered so low that they couldn't hear it. Add in the<br/>fact that he turned his back on them while lowering his head, they knew he didn't want to<br/>talk about it. But that was him, and they needed a good excuse so they could cease<br/>following protocol and help another person who was in need of their help.<p>Trying to be patient, the first paramedic asked: "What was that, son? Could you speak up?"<p>After a moment of self-deliberation, Ryoga decided that telling two paramedics wouldn't<br/>hurt, and it'd hopefully get them off his back. Facing them once again, he stood proud and<br/>tall, his expression one of determination as he replied: "I fainted."<p>The paramedics blinked a few times before bursting out with laughter. Unable to tolerate<br/>being laughed at, Ryoga was enraged well before the passing of a second. "What's so<br/>funny!" He demanded as he scowled at them.<p>The first paramedic suppressed his laughter, so he could say: "That explains why you're in<br/>the WOMAN'S bathroom! You must have been peeping just before everyone got here, and<br/>a woman caught you and socked you right in the nose!" So concluding, he picked up where<br/>he left off and began to laugh again.<p>"That's not what happened!" Ryoga yelled in repudiation, his nostrils flaring in anger. How<br/>dare they accuse him of doing such a thing!<p>"Then, how did it happen?" A new voice questioned, who shoved a microphone into his<br/>face. He let out an "Eep!" of surprise at the sight of it, an "Urk!" of dread as he noticed the<br/>woman holding it, and an "Ack!" of shock upon finding the camera: now the whole of Japan,<br/>no, the WORLD, was going to know he fainted! What was worse, was that everyone will<br/>think that he was peeping; especially Akane!<p>So, in dire need of proving his innocence, he hastily explained: "I was just... just... watching<br/>the fight! Yeah, and then, um..." Well, at least he gave it a good try. Not that it mattered<br/>when someone from across the street shouted: "There he is! That's the guy we were telling<br/>you about!"<p>Ryoga, of course, glanced in the direction of whomever was shouting (his bad sense of<br/>direction leaving his hearing alone), and was startled when he found a mob of people<br/>rushing toward him, reporters and cameramen in tow.<p>"Sorry, but I have to go! Heh-heh!" Ryoga anxiously apologized to the reporter beside him<br/>as he began to put one arm through one of the straps of his backpack as fast as he could.<br/>Having thought one strap could support the backpack as his other hand let go of the other<br/>strap so it, too, could guide its arm into the second strap, he was surprised when his<br/>backpack fell to the ground with a profound thud. The paramedics, cameraman, and the<br/>reporter were astonished as the tile around the backpack became webbed with cracks, as<br/>chips of broken tile popped upward close to where it impacted.<p>Finding his straps cleanly severed, Ryoga, in a panicked manner, blurted: "How in the hell<br/>did THIS happen!"<p>The two paramedics began to rock back and forth on their feet, clasping their hands behind<br/>their backs as they whistled innocently. Who knows if Ryoga would have been fooled by<br/>their conspicuous act (which was meant to be inconspicuous, somehow), but he was too<br/>concerned about leaving the immediate area to notice much about his surroundings.<p>So, after grabbing his backpack by one of its now-inoperative straps, he dashed toward the<br/>restroom door... and left through a newly-installed exit on the opposite wall (which he didn't<br/>notice making). Fortunately (for him, anyway), he found himself in a small alley. Seeing<br/>people down one side, he headed down the other posthaste, crying out: "Damn you,<br/>Ranma! This is all your fault!"<p>-<p>Chapter one - Part three: A new path wrought by pain and loss<p>Ranma fills Akane in about her situation, and they have a heart-to-heart. She then gets a<br/>visit from a mysterious yet familiar woman who comes bearing a gift, and afterwards she<br/>confronts her mother.<p>Crescent Pulsar: My excuses for taking so long in posting this? I was moving! We<br/>switched our trailer for a roomier doublewide. I've been packing, helping clear the yard<br/>(including the removal of a 12x12 deck), and moving stuff around.<p>There were several postponements made by the place we got our doublewide from, so we<br/>spent several days without air conditioning since we sold our unit (having thought that<br/>we'd be staying over at a friend's house since we expected the movers to be there the<br/>following day, and because our new doublewide has a heat and air conditioning system).<br/>So, while I sweltered for four days, I couldn't focus on writing while feeling so... bleh. ; I<br/>had more work to do around the house, anyway.<p>Our friend doesn't have a computer, and we didn't want to impose with ours, so the days we<br/>spent there I couldn't write anything. We planned to only be there three days, but due to<br/>more delays (including two no-work weekends) and waiting for inspections, we ended up<br/>staying there ELEVEN days.<p>Then, after we moved in, I took a rest for two days. I began to write again afterwards, but<br/>decided to post after finishing one part ahead of what I'm posting so I can give accurate<br/>synopsises for the next due part at the end of each post. There was a bunch of fiction and<br/>fan-fiction to catch up with, too. Also, I've begun to write another story on the side that has<br/>a nasty twist in it for poor, hapless Ranma.<p>Basically, I should've had this part done and posted in a week, not six! Oh, well. However,<br/>I'm well on my way with the fourth part of chapter one! Yay! Also, the first chapter should<br/>come to a close after completing part four, and I estimate that the first chapter will be<br/>fifty-thousand words in size. This story is going to be a bit long, so bear with me. (V).<p>As a parting note, I'd like to inform you that the story will gradually become less serious and<br/>a little more humorous after chapter one excepting a few scenes here and there.<br/>Nevertheless, I have a tendency for making things boring, serious, dramatic and angsty; so<br/>please don't hate me!
