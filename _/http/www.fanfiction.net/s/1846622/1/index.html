</div>Disclaimer: What's mine is mine; what's not is not. Darn! That leaves me with practically<br/>nothing! Ideas just don't have much substance... Sigh<p>Author's note: Points finger accusingly This is all your fault! On the table lies the<br/>ever-innocent Pink Floyd album "Dark side of the moon" If it weren't for you... If it<br/>weren't... I wouldn't be writing this pointless thing!<p>Author's note #2: Anyway, this was also inspired by the "Temple of Ranma's seifuku" site.<br/>(It won't be the last time, either.) Frankly, though, I've had this idea floating in my head a<br/>long time before then, and had even written almost three chapters based on it... However,<br/>that was two years ago, and I never posted any of it. (If you think I'm a bad writer now, you<br/>should have seen me then.) But Poly gave me the idea to revise it, and, thanks to her, I have.<p>I had, at first, intended for this idea to be a mega crossover; but the sheer size was daunting,<br/>and I never finished the third chapter, altogether making it 400Kb of wasted effort. So, now,<br/>it's not a mega crossover, and has a completely different plot. It's just a common Sailor<br/>Moon/Ranma 1/2 crossover, now.<p>And, so, I give you one of my many planned stories that will make me the worst writer in<br/>existence! Bwahahahahahaaaaaaaaaa!<p>Dark side of the moon<br/>By: Crescent Pulsar<p>-<p>One leap, followed by another, and yet another: this was Mars' current occupation as she<br/>rushed toward the source of evil.<p>It had been an overall peaceful day (as were the prior weeks before it), but the evil that she<br/>felt in the distance prompted her to abandon her sweeping of the temple's grounds and<br/>search it out. Of course, no sooner had she transformed, had she alerted her fellow senshi<br/>and given the general coordinates of the evil's location.<p>As she leapt from yet another rooftop, she wondered why trouble had to reinsert itself into<br/>their lives so soon. The fight for peace, she knew, would be an ongoing battle until the end<br/>of time. But couldn't it have wait until AFTER summer vacation was over, much less not so<br/>early in the morning?<p>"This better not be something that'll take up TOO much time to defeat." She groused in<br/>thought. She did have some youth she wished to preserve, after all.<p>-<br/>Chapter one - Part one: The Censure! hits the moon.<p>A certain pigtailed martial artist whistled idly as he walked along the top of a fence that<br/>overlooked the canal with his arms folded behind his head, intent on taking his leisurely time<br/>on his way to the empty lot.<p>As you might have already guessed, he was once again on his way to answer one of<br/>Ryoga's challenges. And, as usual, the date for the dual had long since passed. In fact, this<br/>was Ranma's seventh day of routine inspections to see if Ryoga had arrived yet, which had<br/>started three days after the issued date on the challenge.<p>Truth to tell, Ranma was beginning to get a little worried. Ryoga may be late all the time, but<br/>never by ten days. Sure, maybe he wasn't being detained by anything life-threatening (at<br/>least that's what he hoped), but he was nonetheless concerned. Despite his "friend's"<br/>vendetta, there was something that Ranma liked about him that, given time, helped to allay<br/>his anger toward him. As to what that was, well, that was anyone's guess: because he didn't<br/>know himself.<p>His musings were interrupted by faint screams, which were soon followed by explosions and<br/>plumes of smoke not but two blocks away.<p>"What in the hell's goin' on over there?" He wondered, forgetting about his fight with<br/>Ryoga (should he have been in the designated location) and ran towards the disturbance.<br/>Whatever was happening certainly couldn't be caused by anyone he knew, right?<p>Unfortunately, he was correct. Skidding to a stop after rounding the last corner to his<br/>destination, he gawked, shocked at the sight before him.<p>Okay, maybe he'd fought Pantyhose enough times to be confident enough to fight him<br/>without much thought, but THIS thing made him beyond cautious: he was downright<br/>petrified. Two, long, segmented horns protruded from its head, curved much like a ram's. Its<br/>body was monstrous, covered in black fur, and an equally black, leathery hide where such<br/>fur was absent. Muscles bulged to enormous proportions wherever muscle could be found,<br/>and his hands and feet, much like an ape's, seemed larger than normal. On its back, huge,<br/>bat-like wings could be found, adorned with knife-sized nails at the tips of each finger. Its<br/>face, though very much like Pantyhose's, was twisted into an ever-present scowl, with deep<br/>embers for eyes that looked out from the shadowy depths of its eye sockets.<p>If Ranma were capable of thinking at this point and time, and had decided to make a<br/>comparison between the entity before him and the cursed form of Pantyhose, he'd've gladly<br/>fought a dozen of the latter before even THINKING of fighting the former. If anything, the<br/>demon before him could probably win most of its battles through intimidation alone.<p>However, despite the apprehension he felt, his resolve to face the demon solidified as he<br/>watched it pick up a man who tried to run out of one of the stores, enveloping him in some<br/>kind of red energy before tossing him aside like a doll. The unfortunate victim met with a<br/>building's facade with a nauseating splat. It was then, as he watched the man crumple to the<br/>ground (having been morbidly transfixed by the gore he had witnessed), that he noticed<br/>others who had met a similar fate.<p>"ENOUGH!" He yelled, grabbing the demon's attention. He doubted he had a chance of<br/>beating this... thing, but he'd be forever ashamed if he didn't try. One might be surprised if<br/>they knew such doubts, but, then again, whom was there that could read his mind, where<br/>such thoughts were never revealed aloud?<p>His body tensed as the demon sprinted towards him, its hungry eyes unnerving him greatly.<br/>This was not his everyday, run-of-the-mill demon he fought on occasion. No; this one was<br/>dangerous, if those lifeless bodies littering the ground were any indication.<p>When the demon was upon him, he jumped directly into its face, avoiding its grasp at the<br/>same time as he prepared to go straight into the use of his special techniques. And why<br/>not? It'd be foolish to test the waters against something so obviously evil and strong.<p>"Kachu tenshin amaguriken!" He announced, his left fist striking the creature's head<br/>multiple times with all the strength he could muster behind it.<p>The demon lumbered back against the onslaught, but was otherwise unfazed. In fact, it<br/>thoughtlessly threw its head forward, unconcerned about the impact a whole human body<br/>would make against it. This caught Ranma by complete surprise, who was barely fast<br/>enough to shield himself with his arms before impact.<p>Sailing through the air, his forearms screaming in pain, Ranma knew he was outmatched<br/>even before he crashed through a window and several aisles of shelves in a movie rental<br/>shop. But that didn't stop him from standing up and running back out into the light of day,<br/>ready to give his all in hopes of defeating his enemy.<p>The demon awaited him, and licked its chops as it made to grab him again. Ignoring the<br/>former (which was quite disconcerting), he dodged the giant hand (being slightly comforted<br/>at having a speed advantage), gathered his confidence, joined his hands at the base,<br/>extended them towards the target's face, and shouted: "Moko takabisha!"<p>Ranma took the chance to leap back, distancing himself from his opponent to see the<br/>results, wondering if said opponent's inaction was a good sign.<p>It wasn't. When the smoke cleared from its face, it was looking down at him with, if it were at<br/>all possible to tell (much less measure), a hunger bordering on lust. And he was startled<br/>when it spoke, its voice bellowing deep, rattling surrounding windows and vibrating his<br/>body ever-so-slightly. "YUMMMM..."<p>Before he could respond, Ranma found himself crushed within the demon's grasp, who had<br/>taken the opportunity to take advantage of his distraction. Well, you'd be surprised if you<br/>blasted a demon in the face and had gotten such a response as this one had given. You'd<br/>expect them to be annoyed or something at the least.<p>Not this one, though. And Ranma soon found out why as the red energy surrounded him,<br/>stripping him of his strength no sooner than it had appeared: the demon was absorbing his<br/>energy! He struggled, but the demon's grip was too strong for him to escape, and he was<br/>rapidly losing what energy he had for accomplishing such a feat.<p>"Shishi hokodan!"<p>Ranma's body was jarred as a ball of green energy impacted the wrist of the hand that held<br/>him, and, fortunately, the demon relinquished his grip as a result. Falling to his feet, he was<br/>too drained to stand just yet, and fell onto his bottom because of it. However, he was quite<br/>capable of turning his head to regard whom he expected to see a short distance aside from<br/>him: Ryoga.<p>Ryoga, of course, wielded his umbrella in one hand after sending his energy blast, as well as<br/>a smirk on his face as he challenged the demon. "I won't allow you to kill Ranma: that's my<br/>privilege, and mine alone!" So proclaiming, he charged the demon with a battle cry.<p>"Oh, my hero..." Ranma muttered, voice dripping with sarcasm. Honestly; you'd think it'd<br/>take an "eye for an eye" to kill someone in revenge. Then again, that wouldn't work unless<br/>it was normal to become zombies, or ghosts, or something like that... It'd probably be best<br/>not to dwell on that, unless he really wanted a headache.<p>Rising to his feet, having recovered from being drained to some extent, Ranma decided to<br/>attack while Ryoga had the demon's attention. Obviously, someone with more energy (at the<br/>moment) was worth paying more attention to. The question was: what could be done now?<br/>Throwing energy at it was the same as feeding it, and conventional attacks didn't seem to<br/>have much effect. The Hiryu shoten ha wouldn't be possible because of the demon's size<br/>and strength: not because the demon may be too heavy to lift or too strong to be effected,<br/>but because there would be no room to draw it into a spiral, and his shortage of strength<br/>wouldn't allow him to dodge very well, anyway.<p>No sooner had he come to these conclusions, did the demon snatch Ryoga out of the air<br/>(who hadn't figured out that the demon was absorbing his energy blasts). "Ryoga!" He<br/>shouted, then leapt into the air, making an attempt to free his "friend" by attacking from<br/>behind.<p>And was it ever an attempt: the demon, as if nonchalantly, spread its wings out and<br/>swatted him away by turning around. It didn't hurt much, the thin membrane of the wing<br/>that hit him being much softer than a skull, but sliding along the pavement, unable to right<br/>himself onto his feet as the friction quickly done away with the back of his shirt, was<br/>anything but pleasant. Going through a stream of water, which was caused by a busted fire<br/>hydrant that an overturned car rested over, wasn't particularly pleasing, either, and<br/>triggered his curse.<p>Getting to her knees, she raised her head to see that Ryoga was in the process of being<br/>drained in much the same way that she had been. "Damn it!" She cursed, despairing over<br/>the realization that she couldn't do anything.<p>And, so, she didn't even bother to rise to her feet, watching as Ryoga lost more and more of<br/>his strength to the demon, even as he futilely pounded on the hand that held him. But<br/>almost immediately she bowed her head and cracked the asphalt by slamming her fists<br/>against it, thinking desperately for a solution. Of course, only one thing came to mind: using<br/>what strength she had left to, at least, hope to save Ryoga (even at personal risk).<p>So deciding, she jumped to her feet and dashed towards the demon, calling out: "Hey!<br/>Ugly!"<p>"Who're you calling ugly!" Ryoga retorted from his place within the demon's grasp. Said<br/>demon looked over its shoulder to regard her, and promptly snorted.<p>"I wasn't talking to you, you idiot!" Ranma responded, exasperated, just before sliding<br/>between the demon's legs. Then, for the first time in all her years as a martial artist, she<br/>decided to implement a secret technique that was only to be used under the most desperate<br/>of circumstances: the Saotome's school of martial arts secret desperation attack: take the<br/>family jewels! "HAI-YA!"<p>Time seemed to stand still as Ryoga stared at his rival's extended leg, which was currently<br/>embedded in the demon's groin. Ranma's head was turned away, one eye closed and the<br/>other partly so, that small part of her that was curious wanting to know just WHERE her foot<br/>had actually gone.<p>And then time flowed freely again. Ranma landed on one foot, then proceeded to hop up<br/>and down on it as she clutched at her gallant one, which was smarting. Ryoga was released<br/>from his containment and was unceremoniously dumped onto the ground. The demon let<br/>out an ear-deafening howl of pain as it grasped its groin with both hands, tears pouring out<br/>from its void-like eyes.<p>"Ranma!" Ryoga gasped, pointing at said person accusingly. "Have you no shame!"<p>Ranma glared in Ryoga's direction, hardly amused, and still relieving her offended foot from<br/>the ground. "I just saved you, pork butt!"<p>Whatever respite they had gained by Ranma's... unscrupulous attack, it was wasted with<br/>words. Not only that, but it allowed the demon to backhand Ranma before she had a chance<br/>to raise a proper defense, and was sent crashing through a wall of a nearby building.<p>"Mercury aqua rhapsody!" Was called out from above, startling Ryoga, who then<br/>witnessed a jet of water as it smashed into the side of the demon's head. The demon was<br/>knocked off balance and fell onto its side, but soon returned to its feet and turned its gaze to<br/>the figure standing atop a building, forgetting about its former captive as its eyes settled<br/>upon its next victim.<p>Sailor Mercury, who was the first and only to arrive at the scene as of yet, frowned down at<br/>the boy who remained standing beside the demon, whom she thought would have enough<br/>sense to run to safety. "Run!" She shouted. "While I have it distracted!"<p>Run? Ryoga? Never!<p>...<p>Well, maybe a brief retreat to await a second wind. So, he ran across the street and entered<br/>the building Ranma had been hit through, using the entrance she had involuntarily made. It<br/>wasn't that he was concerned about her, it was just a matter of making sure she was alive so<br/>he could kill her later himself.<p>As he heard that strange girl yell that attack of hers again, he found his rival lying in what<br/>remained of a toilet and its stall in some restaurant's restroom...<p>"Where am I?" Ranma wondered, puzzled by her surroundings. All around she found<br/>nothing but whiteness, in the form of feathers, stars, moons, hearts and various styles and<br/>patterns of cloth; and she just knew what fabrics the lattermost were. Also, the background<br/>was opalescent, often casting the colors of the rainbow onto the white objects around her. It<br/>was quite pretty, if she did say so herself.<p>"What am I THINKING!" She questioned herself. Guys didn't describe things as... Hold on;<br/>technically, she was a girl at the moment, and no one seemed to be around, so... Nothing to<br/>worry about!<p>Still, where on earth was she? Was she dead?<p>"You're in a dream, princess."<p>"Who's there!" She exclaimed in alarm, looking about herself for an unknown quarry.<p>It took a moment for her to register what exactly was said, mostly due to being disoriented<br/>by the constant weightlessness she was experiencing. When she did, though, she<br/>demanded: "And who're you callin' a princess!"<p>"Why, you, of course."<p>The slight breeze around her shifted direction, to the west (she could tell somehow), and it<br/>was warm and pleasant. Willing herself to turn about so she could face the movement of the<br/>wind, she yelped in surprise when she found a miniature version of herself directly before<br/>her face. But that couldn't be her! Maybe she had her cobalt blue eyes, vibrant red hair,<br/>creamy white skin, as well as her figure and short stature; but there was no WAY she'd ever<br/>wear that getup!<p>The getup in question was a black, formfitting body suit with white ribbons tied into bows<br/>over her bosom and at the small of her back (the former bearing a shiny black gem at its<br/>center). There was a white, sunburst-pleated miniskirt, that proudly displayed her thighs in<br/>abundance. Her feet and calves were encased in black, knee-length boots with two-inch<br/>heels, the top of each tipped with a small band of white. Also, her hands were fitted with<br/>black gloves that ended around the wrist, where the cuff extended away and removed itself<br/>from contact with her skin with a small band of white encircling the end. The sailor collar<br/>was white with three black stripes along and near the hem, and the choker around her neck<br/>was black. In her ears were dangling earrings, with black, crescent moons hanging from<br/>pearls. Across her temple was a golden tiara with a small, black gem gleaming in its center.<br/>Finally, her fanny-length hair was tied with a black bow at the base of her braid.<p>"Wh-who're you?" She managed to stammer out, feeling quite awkward in a situation she<br/>had never experienced, much less having any idea as to how she should respond to it.<p>"I'm you, silly!" Her mini-self replied, giggling. She hadn't noticed before, but her voice was<br/>very pleasant to hear, a light and sweet soprano if she ever heard one. Did she really sound<br/>like that?<p>"But... How can that be?" She asked, confused. Wasn't she a man? And what was up with<br/>her attire, not to mention diminutive size?<p>Ever smiling, her mini-self genially answered: "I am a spiritual representation of your heart,<br/>and what you see before you is a former incarnation that has been awakened in you. The<br/>day you fell into the nyannichuan, was the day you reclaimed the body and memories of<br/>your past self." She leaned forward, a curious look on her face. "Don't tell me you never<br/>noticed?"<p>Ranma shook her head, hardly comprehending what had just been explained to her. "Notice<br/>what?" She asked. Was she saying that she was a girl in a past life, and the nyannichuan<br/>had made her that girl?<p>"Concentrate." Was her mini-self's simple reply, remaining patient.<p>Even more confounded now, Ranma regarded her in puzzlement. "Concentrate on what?"<br/>She wondered in thought. Maybe... She did say something about memories from her past<br/>life... Was that it?<p>Concentrating on memories she didn't even know she had, closing her eyes and clearing her<br/>mind in the process, she was finally aware of how calm she was in the place she found<br/>herself at and that being nude hadn't even bothered her nor seem important. Also, her<br/>thought processes were working perfectly, everything coming and going freely and clearly.<br/>How strange.<p>What was even more strange, was the sudden realization of what her mini-self was referring<br/>to. She had thought back to the day she had been cursed, but, for some unknown reason,<br/>she had just now noticed how different she was before taking her fateful plunge. In her<br/>search for the memories that belonged to her past life, she had instead found some from her<br/>current one and, in all honesty, did not like what she found.<p>She, before the plunge, was very much like her father in almost every way. And, despite not<br/>having any experience with girls, she knew she'd've been confident enough to... get what<br/>she wanted out of her girlfriends. She was so arrogant, so thoughtless and selfish... How<br/>could she have not noticed the changes (the lack of confidence, thoughtlessness and<br/>selfishness) after being cursed? She should have been confident when she first met the<br/>Tendo's, and would have picked Kasumi since she seemed so docile and easy to manipulate.<p>God! Would she have really done that? Yes... Yes, she would have. But the curse, or rather<br/>the blessing, had seemingly mixed her personality with that of her past incarnation's, and<br/>made such an occurrence impossible. She wasn't sure how she knew, but an unknown<br/>intuition told her that she was absolutely correct.<p>So, the Ranma that was carried into the Tendo's lives (literally), was more timid and<br/>conscientious, more selfless and open to learning. However, depending on the<br/>circumstances, the better or worse aspects of her personality could be drawn out and be<br/>more dominant.<p>Opening her eyes to gaze at her mini-self, she was given a bouncy nod and a radiant smile.<br/>"That's right." She was told, answering her unasked question.<p>"But... Why?" She inquired, then hastily added: "Not that I'm complainin' or nothin'."<p>And why not complain? From her viewpoint at this point and time, she hated her former self.<br/>Perhaps she wouldn't have such an opinion of herself if no changes to her personality were<br/>made, but how could she have lived with herself treating people even worse than her father?<br/>Moreover, why had she not noticed before: that she was different?<p>"Beats me!" Came the cheery reply, causing Ranma to look at her oddly. Then, shrugging,<br/>she said: "I'm a part of you that you never used in your past incarnation, so I'm about as<br/>much in the dark as you are. However..."<p>"However?" Ranma inquired intently, taking the bait.<p>"However, the reason for us meeting together like this at long last, is because your 'heart'<br/>yearns for the capability to do good, to protect others from evil, much like the monstrosity<br/>that defeated you."<p>"I wasn't defeated." Ranma grumbled, looking down and blushing. "I'm just taking a<br/>breather, okay?"<p>"Whatever you say." Her mini-self replied, amused. "Either way, it's your choice to unlock<br/>your heritage and memories. As your guardian, I've come in your time of need, and in<br/>response to the call of destiny. The choice is up to you."<p>"Waitaminute!" Ranma blurted abruptly. "Heritage? Guardian? Destiny? What're you talking<br/>about?"<p>With an impish little grin, her "guardian" cryptically said: "Now THAT... is a secret!" She<br/>was waggling her finger at her.<p>Ranma, for lack of a better word, was not amused. In fact, she was quite miffed, and her<br/>facial expression demonstrated so.<p>Sighing forlornly, her guardian allowed her limbs to hang languidly, and, with a pout, said:<br/>"You're no fun, at all."<p>Feeling a little apologetic, though still serious, Ranma softly stated: "I'm sorry. But I don't<br/>understand what's going on, and I've had enough problems caused by jumping into the<br/>unknown before, you know?"<p>"I do." Her guardian replied, smiling slightly. "I'm you, remember?"<p>"Yeah, about that..." Ranma spoke, trailing off, hoping to elicit certain information.<p>"Well..." Her guardian began thoughtfully, tapping an index finger against her chin. "Every<br/>living thing has a star seed: the planets, the animals, you, and every other creature in the<br/>cosmos. That's the part of you that I represent, but I'm no ordinary star seed. You see,<br/>certain star seeds are special, and they are called sailor crystals."<p>"What's a sailor crystal?" Ranma interjected.<p>"Don't interrupt!" Her guardian snapped, glaring balefully.<p>"Okay, okay!" Ranma quickly acquiesced. And she thought Akane was capricious!<p>Clearing her throat, her guardian continued in a lecturing tone. "Anyway, a sailor crystal<br/>draws power from certain planets or celestial objects, in order to protect them. You, princess,<br/>are one of two who have a moon crystal; or so it was, anyway. Your sister relinquished her<br/>ties with the moon, gradually, by adapting the Silver crystal as her source of power, her<br/>existence. Your destiny lies on a similar path, to allow a new moon crystal to be born."<p>Ranma didn't understand much of the information at all, but she did manage to catch a few<br/>interesting words as she had done once before. "Princess? Sister?" Her face contorted into<br/>a vision of pure complexity. Since when did she have a sister? And how could she be a<br/>princess? She was particularly surprised at not being disturbed by such feminine titles.<p>"All sailor crystals are considered royalty." Her guardian explained. "But you were also born<br/>a noble in your past incarnation where you had a twin sister, who has been reincarnated as<br/>you have."<p>"I... see..." Ranma mumbled slowly, trying to make sense of everything she had learned thus<br/>far and only succeeding marginally.<p>For reasons she wouldn't share with her charge, the guardian of Ranma's sailor crystal softly<br/>said: "I apologize, but I must go now."<p>"But... But I have so many things to ask!" Ranma implored, growing worried. "Wh-what do I<br/>do? What do I do with my sailor crystal? What do I do with my sister? How will this effect<br/>my current life?" She was practically pleading as she said: "Please! Tell me!"<p>Her guardian regarded her with compassion in response to her tearing eyes, and softly<br/>explained: "You must make the decision, princess. Your heart is your key; feel it, follow it,<br/>allow it to guide you in the right direction. You can continue with your old life, or venture<br/>into a new world of learning and growth. Making the transition, should you decide to follow<br/>that path, will not be easy. Choose..." She began to fade away as she retreated into a source<br/>of light that grew ever brighter. "Until, perhaps, we meet again..."<p>Ranma shielded her eyes with her arms as she was blinded by a flash of light, as it<br/>encompassed everything and yet nothing...<p>Groaning, her body aching from the blow that had been incurred by the demon, Ranma<br/>opened her eyes and focused on the blurry shadow that stood in front of the portal of light<br/>(which was the hole in the wall).<p>"Good; I see you've managed to survive, Ranma." Came a condescending voice from the<br/>shadowy figure, that Ranma quickly recognized as Ryoga's.<p>"Shove it, Ryoga." She replied sourly, wincing at the pain she felt as she sat up, several<br/>shards of porcelain cutting her. "The least you could do is show some gratitude."<p>Ryoga snorted, turning his head away as he said: "I didn't ask for your help. I almost had<br/>myself free when you butt in."<p>Ranma was tempted to argue, but decided against it. There was a demon to take care of,<br/>regardless of her physical condition, and she was determined to fight it until the end.<p>Clambering to her feet, the act quite painstaking, her thoughts focused on that dream she<br/>had. It felt like it had happened to somebody else, as she had acted somewhat differently<br/>(she decided), but she was certain it had been her that had been the recipient of the dream.<p>And what a dream! If she hardly understood anything whilst she dreamed, she hadn't a clue<br/>as the dream faded from her conscious memory. She could remember key elements that had<br/>caught her immediate attention in the dream, as well as the end of it; but that was about it.<p>"What're you doing?" Ryoga inquired, watching as his rival leaned against the remaining<br/>partition of the stall for support.<p>She turned her head to regard the eternally lost boy, a "you've got to be kidding me" look<br/>on her face. "What do you think?" She asked rhetorically. "I'm going back out there to fight<br/>that thing."<p>"HA!" Ryoga exclaimed, his mocking tone nettling Ranma almost instantly. "You couldn't<br/>do anything before, and now you can barely stand!"<p>"I didn't see you do any better!" Ranma stated crossly, wishing she had the strength to<br/>pound that arrogant bastard's head in.<p>But he was right about one thing: she was quite unsteady on her feet. There was no chance<br/>of her fighting now, as she would be just as vulnerable as any other normal person who<br/>crossed the demon's path.<p>"Jupiter oak revolution!" This was followed by an explosion and an enraged outcry from<br/>none other than the demon.<p>"What's going on out there?" Ranma wondered aloud, gazing out the hole in the tiled wall.<p>"You mean... You don't know?" Ryoga queried carefully, signs of disbelief creeping across<br/>his visage.<p>"Venus love and beauty shock!" And it sounded like the demon was shocked to find that it<br/>wasn't very lovely at all.<p>Glaring at Ryoga, ill-humored, Ranma pointedly said: "I was unconscious, remember?"<p>Ryoga blinked a few consecutive times, regarding her silently for a few seconds, before<br/>bursting out at the seams with laughter. How could anyone be ignorant of the senshi?<p>Ranma was visibly steaming, and wished she could put her foot where the sun didn't shine;<br/>but she wouldn't be able to do that to Ryoga after injuring her one foot doing that groin<br/>attack, and wouldn't be able to stand on it if she lost support by using the other to do the<br/>job.<p>"I don't need this crap!" Ranma thought, miffed. So thinking, she stumbled towards the exit<br/>she had installed earlier against her will. Maybe she couldn't fight the demon, but she could<br/>certainly leave the company of that annoying jackass.<p>Grabbing ahold of the wall for support, she stood within the hole and stared wide-eyed at<br/>the sight of color-coded cheerleaders as they wove around the demon, seeming to distract it<br/>with proximity of numbers while another separated from the group undetected.<p>"Mars flame sniper!" And the lone cheerleader fired an arrow of flame, striking the demon<br/>from behind and knocking it to the ground. Much of its hair was singed.<p>The other three quickly took the opportunity to unleash their own attacks while the demon<br/>was prostrate.<p>"Venus love and beauty shock!"<p>"Mercury aqua rhapsody!"<p>"Jupiter oak revolution!"<p>Ranma gaped, amazed at the display of power she was witnessing. Who were they! And<br/>what were those attacks that they were using, that the demon couldn't absorb? If she had<br/>attacks like those, then she'd have no problem taking out the stupid demon herself.<p>When the smoke from the attack cleared, the demon picked itself up from the floor of the<br/>crater and shook its head, clearing it of the disorientation the blasts of those attacks had<br/>induced. Then, turning her attention to the cheerleader in red, she found her yelling to<br/>nobody in particular as she pressed an index finger onto the stud of her earring. She was too<br/>far away to understand what she was saying despite her yelling, but it was obvious that she<br/>was quite unhappy.<p>Again, Ranma wondered who they were. Did they associate with... What was her name...<br/>Mariko something... Well, did they associate with whomever she was thinking of? That<br/>would explain the strange names of their attacks, and why they resembled cheerleaders. But<br/>where were their batons, or pompoms? "Still, they won't be able to defeat the demon by<br/>themselves." She observed privately.<p>Which was why she had to do something. She had a score to settle with that demon,<br/>anyway; so she thought that she deserved to bring it down herself. But how; knowing full<br/>well her incapability of walking a straight line, much less fight?<p>"Choose..." Echoed in the background of her thoughts, startling her slightly. Then it<br/>dawned on her! These cheerleaders looked like her guardian! Maybe they weren't<br/>cheerleaders (not that that mattered), then? But they were undoubtedly suited for battling<br/>energy-eating demons, and were powerful to boot. Just what kind of attacks do they use,<br/>anyway? As she watched the orange-colored "cheerleader" use her attack, she noticed that<br/>there was no reaction from her senses, and couldn't find a trace of a ki signature.<p>Ryoga, by now, had suppressed his laughter and joined his rival's side within the hole;<br/>although his attention was on said rival, and not the girls fighting the demon outside. "You<br/>really don't know who they are?"<p>Ranma looked askance and, seeing that Ryoga seemed more curious than ready-to-tease,<br/>she answered by giving him a light shake of her head in the negative, before asking: "Who<br/>are they?" And then she continued to watch the mysterious girls fight.<p>"They're the sailor senshi." Ryoga answered simply, turning his attention to the fight. "I'm<br/>surprised you never heard of them."<p>"Sailor senshi..." Ranma worded quietly, too low for Ryoga to hear over the din of battle.<br/>There was that "sailor" word, from her dream. And these senshi were no doubt protectors,<br/>as her guardian had said they would be, with their planets being declared with each attack.<br/>Was she to be like them?<p>Reviewing the remnants of her dream, she realized that this was the choice that she was to<br/>make: whether to be, or not to be, a senshi. She could be a protector, one capable of<br/>defeating the sort of demon that those girls now confronted.<p>Girls? Yes... All of them were girls; not powerful, musclebound men in spandex with mighty<br/>swords or some other weapon of justice, but innocent, seemingly fragile girls... And they<br/>wielded a power she could only dream of having. Sure, she was good, but even she could<br/>tell that the four senshi had her beat in all but her livelihood: her skill as a martial artist.<p>But she had a sailor crystal, didn't she? Couldn't she use the same power and defeat that<br/>demon? Well, she didn't know if she would be able to defeat it (seeing as the other four<br/>couldn't accomplish that with all of their power combined), but she hoped that she would be<br/>able to accomplish such a feat. The only question remaining, was: how to go about<br/>becoming a senshi.<p>She pondered for a few moments, continuing to watch the battle as Ryoga did. Then, after<br/>catching a glimpse of one of the senshi's brooches, she remembered an aspect of her dream<br/>that held the answer she was looking for. She had to use her heart, as her guardian had told<br/>her that her heart was the key; that she should follow it, and allow it to guide her in the right<br/>direction. Well, she knew exactly what she wanted, so now it was only a matter of acquiring<br/>it.<p>Closing her eyes, blocking out all the outside disturbances, she began to search out her<br/>heart blindly, not knowing how to find it. It seemed obvious that she should concentrate on<br/>the beating organ in her chest, but she knew better, through training and meditation, that<br/>not all things are to be taken literally when told to focus or use something that one couldn't<br/>hope to focus on or use through conventional means.<p>The search was, to her relief and delight, short. No sooner had she started, had her heart<br/>been drawn to her desire to accept her role as a senshi, her pure intentions a shining beacon<br/>for her heart to use as a guide, so as to find her and make contact. The contact nearly stole<br/>her mental breath away; it was so warm and comforting, suffusing her whole body as it<br/>seemed to breeze right through her from a westerly direction... Just like in her dream, when<br/>her guardian arrived!<p>Glancing over at Ranma, Ryoga was shocked to find her illuminated in a hazy, white glow,<br/>her hair and clothing being swept about wildly by a nonexistent gale. Also, by the serene<br/>expression on her face, he almost mistook her for someone else. Ranma? That content and<br/>cute? Not a chance!<p>...<p>"What in the hell am I thinking!" Ryoga exclaimed in thought, wanting but unable to turn<br/>away from the sight before him. It was no wonder he so easily became attracted to Ranma<br/>whenever she was in disguise: she was quite lovely when she actually appeared to be a girl.<p>"R-Ranma...?" He addressed uncomfortably, though still intently, in hopes of getting an<br/>answer for what was happening.<p>Ranma was too engrossed with the energy that lie dormant behind a never-before-opened<br/>"door" to register Ryoga's voice, delighting in the knowledge that, despite not knowing<br/>what the key to opening the "door" was consciously, she could confidently open it by<br/>using an instinctive withdrawal from her subconscious. And that's exactly what she did.<br/>Clasping both hands over her physical heart, she announced: "Moon prism power, make<br/>up!"<p>She was instantly consumed with the unfamiliar power when she unleashed it, feeling it<br/>dissolve her clothing and wrap about her body. Her heart raced, as the power swelled into<br/>an accessible reservoir beyond its enclosure; and her injuries were healed, relieving her of<br/>the pain. She soon felt her modesty returned to her, as she could feel some formfitting attire<br/>encase her torso, legs, hands and neck; and something cold and metallic graced her temple.<br/>And the power did more, but she could not readily tell what the finishing touches were: only<br/>that the new power was as much a part of her as her life energy, now.<p>When her induction into senshihood was through, she was left feeling exhilarated,<br/>pleasantly warm, and refreshed. She felt light on her feet, clear of mind, and confident<br/>enough to conquer anything; and conquer something she would.<p>Reintroducing her eyes to the light of day again, her curiosity influenced her to glance down<br/>at herself, and she gasped in amazement when she did so: she was wearing the same getup<br/>her guardian wore! Inspecting herself more thoroughly, she found that everything was<br/>exactly as she remembered it in her dream. Well, after pulling her pigtail over her shoulder for<br/>a look, it was easy to tell that it wasn't any longer than usual (not that she was concerned).<p>Then, remembering about a certain bandanna-clad boy, she looked beside her and found...<br/>empty space. Casting her eyes downward, she found her quarry lying on the ground, a trail<br/>of blood trickling from his nose and a goofy grin plastered on his face. He was, of course,<br/>insensible. Realizing how Ryoga had come to be in that state, she giggled and said: "Serves<br/>ya right, bacon breath."<p>"I can't believe dumpling head had to be sick today, of all days!" Ranma's right ear perked<br/>up upon catching. Turning aside to see what was happening, she managed to get her first<br/>close-up view of the red-colored senshi as she leapt into the air and away from her close<br/>proximity to her... Showing off her bottom in the process, and making her blush furiously.<p>Overcoming her embarrassment, she awaited the best opportunity to intrude and have a<br/>rematch with that demon (so she didn't jump right into an attack the other senshi couldn't<br/>rein in). Seeing it, she dashed out into the open and made her intentions known, yelling:<br/>"Hey! Ugly!" She hoped that, by repeating her earlier insult, it would catch the demon off<br/>guard (as well as arrest the attention of the other senshi so they'd cease whatever strategy<br/>they were still in the process of employing).<p>The demon barely spared her a glance over its shoulder before returning its attention to the<br/>orange-colored senshi, but suddenly spun around in a hurry to face an opponent worthy of<br/>its concern (now that it realized): a senshi making a direct attack. It made the mistake of<br/>classifying the owner of the voice as weak (since it had defeated the owner of said voice<br/>before), so it realized, only too late, that it had allowed the new senshi time to get right into<br/>its face before it could properly react to the threat.<p>Grinning in triumph, glad that her voice hadn't warranted any attention from the demon (and<br/>had actually worked as a distraction), she gave the demon her knuckle sandwich special<br/>right in the nose. The demon's feet flew right out from under it as its head retreated and<br/>slammed into the asphalt with a window-shattering thud.<p>The four inner senshi gaped, shocked by the new senshi's display of physical prowess.<p>Before the demon could recover, Ranma grabbed it by one of its pinkie toes (the others<br/>being too big for her small hands) and began to heave it up into the air, swing it in an arch,<br/>and then slam it down onto the asphalt. She repeated these motions a few dozen times.<p>The senshi continued to gape.<p>Brushing off her hands when she was finished, Ranma looked down at her work with<br/>satisfaction. The demon was now lying face down in a hole that was shaped much like itself,<br/>one of its legs twitching every now and again. Not one to leave a job half done, she decided<br/>to use a technique that was only available to her as a senshi, one that came to mind as<br/>naturally as one would expect from someone who had used it many times previous.<p>"Moon tiara action!" Throwing her tiara like a frisbee, it quickly spun fast enough with the<br/>aid of magic to appear as a solid disk, passing through the demon's neck without apparent<br/>trouble. And so the demon perished, dissolving into nothing, and Ranma was proud of a job<br/>well done. She then glanced up, surprised that her tiara reappeared on her head without<br/>having to retrieve it and do it herself. That, in her opinion, was quite convenient.<p>At hearing the name and seeing the sight of one of sailor Moon's trademark attacks, the<br/>inner senshi regained their senses and cautiously approached the redheaded senshi as a<br/>group. Ranma allowed this, waiting patiently as she wondered how to respond to them.<br/>Would she become a member of their team, become friends or, at least, become<br/>acquaintances?<p>The senshi whose dominant color was orange, who had thigh-length blonde hair that was<br/>accessorized in the back by a red bow, stepped ahead of the others and asked: "We<br/>appreciate the help, but that attack you used... Who are you?"<p>Ranma crossed her arms and frowned, making her displeasure about their offhanded offense<br/>known to them. They seemed inclined to being civil, but she knew they were suspicious<br/>about something... And she's had enough suspicion in her life already. Why do so many<br/>people distrust her? Outside of battle she rarely lied, and it was the movement of her body,<br/>and not her mouth, that was deceptive most of the time even then. If they were going to be<br/>like everyone else, then why care about them, much less be friendly toward them?<p>"What's it to ya?" She counter-questioned in a defensive tone.<p>"Sorry," The senshi in blue spoke up in apology, realizing they had to tread more softly with<br/>the, to all appearances, new senshi. "But you must understand that another senshi utilizes<br/>the same title for her attack." As for whom, she remained vague, being precautious about<br/>what information to divulge.<p>"So?" Ranma argued indifferently. "That's what came to mind, so that's what I said."<p>The senshi in red opened her mouth in preparation to reply, but was interrupted by a raspy<br/>"Hey guys!" from above. Everyone turned to look up at the new arrival, who stood atop and<br/>on the ledge of a two-story electronic appliances shop. She didn't appear to be feeling well,<br/>if her facial expression and the arm resting over her stomach was any indication.<p>"What did I miss?" The new arrival questioned, looking about herself and finding the<br/>immediate area (most especially the road) moderately damaged. The motion made her<br/>unsteady on her shaky legs, and she began to lurch forward. Unable to regain her balance<br/>while flailing her arms up and down, she wailed as she toppled toward the ground.<p>The inner senshi, having much experience with their princess and her clumsy behavior, were<br/>more than ready to catch her. However, they weren't ready for the blur that was the new<br/>senshi, who arrived below their princess before her feet left contact with the roof of the<br/>building and eventually caught her and placed her gently on the ground.<p>"You okay?" Ranma asked, despite the answer being obvious. She hadn't known what a<br/>senshi was, much less know they exist, but she could tell the girl she knelt before was one.<br/>Even so, she wondered why this one looked so different. What made her that way? Did it<br/>represent her status, strength or capabilities? And those wings; were they even capable of<br/>performing their purpose, or just there for looks or something?<p>"Oh, I just have a stomach virus..." Usagi replied, then paused when she realized the voice<br/>was unfamiliar to her ears. Looking up, she found the face of a stranger, one with fiery red<br/>hair and... blue eyes? Yes... But there was something about them... Something familiar.<p>Ranma felt really uncomfortable under her scrutiny, and so avoided eye contact with her.<br/>"You have my, um, sympathy." She answered, uncertain as to what to say.<p>"Who are you?" Usagi inquired, wondering who the new senshi was. All the senshi of their<br/>solar system were accounted for, weren't they? Other senshi from elsewhere had different<br/>dress codes to represent their systems, but this one was undeniably under theirs. Besides<br/>the sun (which no one knew whether a senshi could be tied to or not), what senshi could the<br/>one before her possibly be?<p>"That's what we were trying to find out." Came a voice from beside them. Both Usagi and<br/>Ranma looked aside and found the other senshi walking up to them, and soon stopping a<br/>few feet away. Usagi noticed that it was Makoto whom had spoken, who continued, saying:<br/>"She used your 'moon tiara action' attack." Then added: "And I thought that we all had our<br/>own unique attacks for a reason." The others nodded afterward, agreeing with her.<p>"Isn't that my weakest attack?" Usagi questioned, unable to concentrate too well because<br/>she was more concerned about the watering of her mouth, and the feeling that she was<br/>going to unload her stomach of its contents again. Besides, why should she be worried<br/>about something so trivial? So what if someone else was throwing their tiara around.<p>Rei, exasperated, said: "Of course it's your attack! Aren't you paying attention?"<p>"But I'm not feeling good..." Usagi whined in her defense, bringing Ranma to support her,<br/>who said: "Yeah; so stop making her feel worse."<p>"And who were you, again?" Minako asked sweetly, all smiles, bending over to be at eye<br/>level with the new senshi. Ranma recoiled a bit at the intrusion of her personal space, but<br/>was even more discomforted by the subject of her identity being returned to the spotlight.<p>Placing her hand behind her head, and smiling nervously, Ranma replied: "Just your<br/>everyday cheerleader... Nobody special... Ha-ha-ha!"<p>"'Cheerleader?'" Makoto echoed and placing arms akimbo, sounding offended. You wouldn't<br/>catch her wearing a cheerleader's uniform unless it was ASOLUTELY necessary for<br/>infiltration and disposal of an enemy. To insinuate that she was wearing such an outfit was<br/>the same as asking for a broken nose.<p>In the background, Ami sighed to herself, knowing they'd lost the chance of finding out the<br/>new senshi's name... for now. Oh, well; leaving it up to those with little tact results in such<br/>failures as this. When next they have a meeting, she will be sure to brief them about it.<p>"Well, yeah." Ranma replied, sounding as if it were common knowledge. "A weird-looking<br/>cheerleader, I admit; but not too weird if I had a baton or some pompoms."<p>Makoto was visibly mad, now. It was bad enough to say she was wearing a cheerleader<br/>outfit, but a weird one, too? Fortunately, Rei pulled her aside and, looking down at the new<br/>senshi, emphatically stated: "Look, all we want to know, is who you are. It's not going to kill<br/>you to share that much, will it?"<p>"I s'pose not." Ranma sighed in resignation, then stood up and crossed her arms loosely to<br/>seem more impressive, smirking proudly as she said: "I'm Dark side."<p>The other senshi blinked, then simultaneously queried: "'Dark side?'"<p>"Of the moon." Ranma helpfully supplied. Seeing that they were staring at her mutely in<br/>response, she asked: "What?"<p>"Um..." Usagi began uncertainly as she picked herself up from the ground, placing a hand<br/>over her chest to indicate herself. "I'm Eternal sailor moon." And she really, REALLY wanted<br/>to go back home and spend some time with a porcelain bowl. Not that she wanted to, but<br/>what better place was there to release your vomit in?<p>"Oh..." Ranma voiced in response, not knowing what else to do. At least she now knew the<br/>reason for them being cautious around her, representing the same celestial object and all.<br/>She guessed that it must be more from being an unknown element, or else they would have<br/>expected her to discover her heritage (as her guardian put it) eventually.<p>The other senshi soon introduced themselves in turn since she had finally revealed herself,<br/>but no personal identifications were given just yet. She didn't know how to greet them, or<br/>even if she should try to get acquainted, so she just nodded as they each identified<br/>themselves by their respective planets: Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. She absently<br/>wondered where the rest were.<p>"Well," Ami started, somewhat surprised at finding out the new senshi's identity since she<br/>was sure they had upset her in some fashion in the beginning and had ruined the chance of<br/>learning it. "We all agree that we've never heard of Dark side of the moon?" All present,<br/>except Ami and Ranma, voiced their agreement. Ranma remained silent, wondered what was<br/>happening now. Were they questioning her station? "Then perhaps we should ask Luna<br/>and Artemis. They'd know if she was present during the Silver millennium."<p>Ranma didn't know what the "Silver millennium" was, but she found herself interested in this<br/>"Artemis" person. Somehow, and for some unknown reason, the name sounded familiar.<p>"Luna!" Usagi croaked out, wishing she was within the comfort of her home so she could<br/>avoid vomiting in front of her friends and suffering embarrassment. "It's okay to come out<br/>now!"<p>Searching with her eyes, Ranma didn't find anyone approaching within her line of sight.<br/>Soon, however, she found out why when a new voice spoke up from the ground nearby,<br/>asking: "So, who is this? Another senshi?" Luna was a cat! Beside her was another one, and<br/>they were both scrutinizing her! Wait a minute; did one of them just SPEAK!<p>"We were hoping you'd know." Ami answered Luna, who turned to face the senshi of<br/>Mercury with a pensive look on her face. Artemis was the only one to leave his attention on<br/>the new senshi, who began to inch away stealthily, maintaining eye contact with him.<p>"Um, guys?" Artemis spoke up, interrupting Luna's thoughts.<p>"What is it, Artemis?" Luna replied as she turned to regard him, sounding and looking<br/>annoyed.<p>Nodding his head in the direction of the departing redheaded senshi, he said: "Seems our<br/>guest is leaving early."<p>All turned to discover that Artemis was right. Ranma, who found herself caught, laughed<br/>nervously while rubbing the back of her head in agitation. She wasn't too surprised, though:<br/>that white cat HAD kept an eye on her, after all.<p>"And where do you think YOU'RE going?" Rei petulantly demanded, hands on hips. Ami<br/>shook her head disapprovingly, wondering why she didn't take charge and handle the<br/>situation as it should have been handled.<p>"Um..." Ranma voiced, looking about wildly as she tried to conceive a believable excuse for<br/>her need to vacate the area. She didn't want them to know of her acute ailurophobia for<br/>several reasons, so she wasn't about to stick around so they could find out. Becoming<br/>desperate for something to say after a moment without a forthcoming answer, she hastily<br/>resorted to saying: "Oh, look at the time! I've seemed to've forgotten a... previous<br/>engagement! Yeah, that's it! See ya!" And she was off and away!<p>"Don't just stand there!" Luna chided the others, who had yet to understand the new<br/>senshi's behavior as they stood, unmoving, unprepared to give chase. "After her!"<p>And, so, they gave chase (though Usagi was quite reluctant even after Luna chomped on<br/>her ankle as an incentive). Usagi had to catch up with the others, so she was the only one<br/>who didn't have visual contact of their quarry. Fortunately, because she could see her<br/>comrades, she was able to follow the progress of the chase without getting lost. Still, all the<br/>jumping around wasn't making her feel any better, and she really wished that demon had<br/>shown itself on another day.<p>Looking behind her and seeing that the others were giving chase, Ranma wondered why<br/>these sort of things always happened to her. What had she ever done to deserve being<br/>chased? In any case, she had to lose them and get back home, so she could relax and reflect<br/>on what had happened to her this day.<p>After several minutes of thought, running and jumping in random directions so the senshi<br/>behind her wouldn't know the direction of the residence she lived at, she decided that the<br/>only way to shake them was to literally disappear from their sight. She did wonder how they<br/>managed to find her even after giving them the slip (or so she had thought), because she<br/>was sure her expertly-performed evasive maneuvers would elude all but the old ghoul and<br/>freak.<p>Little did she know that Ami was leading the group with her visor, which was homing on her<br/>life and magical energies. It had saved them from losing her a dozen times, and they knew<br/>that, without it, they would have surely lost the new senshi. However, they did have it, and<br/>Ami was doing her best to not lose her concentration because the life energy read-out on<br/>the new senshi was very large in supply compared to normal. It was nearly as high as her<br/>magical energy!<p>Ahead of the inner senshi, who were followed by Usagi, Luna and Artemis, Ranma cursed<br/>when she failed to shake her pursuers; even after using all her umisen-ken training to hide<br/>her life energy (or ki) while dashing from one place to another, as she made sure to keep her<br/>momentum as fast as ever so she could be nigh untraceable to the naked eye. It seemed to<br/>improve her situation a little, but it was evident that her quick pace wasn't quick enough to<br/>not be seen; and to appear invisible she had to constantly move in a zigzag pattern because<br/>staying in one's direct line of sight (which would be caused by running in one direction in<br/>this case) would not give the effect she wanted. So, no matter how fast she moved, she was<br/>making it impossible for herself to increase the distance between her and her followers<br/>(which hadn't made a difference in the first place).<p>However, as her thoughts turned to other ways of making those chasing her lose sight of<br/>her, something directed her attention to the new energy source enveloping her ki field.<br/>Somehow, she knew she could change it and use it for a different purpose, a purpose she<br/>was more in need of for the time being: literally making herself invisible. She didn't know if it<br/>would work, but she had the feeling that it would; being a senshi seems to instill such<br/>instincts.<p>"She's disappearing!" Makoto gasped, witnessing the red-haired senshi fade from sight as<br/>the other three did.<p>"Don't worry!" Ami assured them. The life energy of the senshi they were pursuing might<br/>not be registering on her visor, but she could still detect the magical signature as before,<br/>and could, thus, continue to follow it. "Just listen for..." She ceased her instructions and<br/>abruptly shouted: "Go right!" The others got the hint, and proceeded to follow the senshi of<br/>Mercury as she guided them towards a now-invisible senshi.<p>"Damn it!" Ranma swore after a few more minutes of being chased, wondering how they (the<br/>senshi behind her) managed to keep track of her. Glancing behind her, she finally noticed<br/>how Mercury (as she introduced herself as) pointed in her direction whenever she changed<br/>course, and that she was the only one wearing a visor of some kind.<p>Not knowing what else to do, she decided that her only place of sanctuary would be at her<br/>home. So concluding, she ceased being invisible since it was obviously making no<br/>difference, and made a beeline for the Tendo domicile. Hopefully, the senshi following her<br/>would respect her and not invade her place of residence.<p>Upon landing in the backyard a short time later, she dashed into the veranda and hid herself<br/>behind its outer wall, standing rigid and quiet as she hoped for the withdrawal of her<br/>pursuers.<p>Outside, standing along the top of the perimeter wall, four senshi took in the sight of the<br/>house that the red-haired senshi had taken into hiding.<p>"Should we follow?" Minako asked Ami, her breathing labored by exertion just as the<br/>others' were.<p>"No." Ami responded simply, subdued.<p>"Why not?" Rei asked, eyeing Ami questioningly.<p>It was Makoto who spoke next, answering Rei's question with a statement. "It's her home,<br/>isn't it?" She could tell because of several factors: firstly, Ami made it clear not to follow the<br/>new senshi; secondly, the new senshi had tried to hide in random houses before going<br/>DIRECTLY to this particular one; and lastly, the new senshi relinquished her invisibility<br/>before doing so, as if giving up.<p>"Oh..." Rei and Minako voiced together in understanding. If they breached such a personal<br/>place, what would that make them look like? Actually, it was bad enough chasing her like a<br/>hunted animal, though they hardly knew how else to respond to the new senshi's strange<br/>behavior after Luna issued the pursuit. Currently, though, they found their actions unwise,<br/>and it probably cost them a great deal of trust in regard to the newest senshi.<p>It was about then that Usagi finally arrived, hobbling towards them on ground level and<br/>looking green in the face. Luna and Artemis ran ahead of her, the former addressing the<br/>senshi. "Where is she?"<p>"Home." Makoto answered before she and the others left the heights of the wall to join their<br/>princess on the ground.<p>Luna sighed in disappointment, then said: "All I wanted to do was ask a few questions."<p>"You mean, you don't know who she is?" Rei inquired intently.<p>Luna shook her head negatively, while Artemis helpfully inserted: "Nor do I."<p>Ami pondered, wondering what best course of action to use from their current situation.<br/>Finding only one worth mentioning, she said: "Perhaps Pluto would know? She is the eldest<br/>and has seen many eras, so maybe this new senshi lived before we did in the Silver<br/>millennium, and Pluto knew of her?"<p>"It's a start." Minako commented with the slightest shrug of her shoulders, not seeing<br/>anything particularly good or bad about the idea.<p>Usagi found something wrong with it, though, who was currently on her hands and knees<br/>as the need to vomit sapped her strength. "But don't..." She swallowed, her mouth highly<br/>salivated. It was the only time she didn't like having her mouth salivating: when she had to<br/>return her food to the light of day. "Start right now..."<p>Everyone gathered around their princess, concerned about her health. Luna stepped<br/>beneath her bowed head, looked up and apologetically asked: "I'm sorry for dragging you<br/>out here, but it was necessary at the time. Would you like some assistance back home?"<p>In reply, Usagi raised her head, opened her mouth... and Luna's eyes widened in alarm as<br/>something much unlike words came spewing forth from her princess' lips.<p>Just as Ranma finished her detransformation with the help of her new instincts, she was<br/>startled by a woeful cry that came from the other side of the perimeter wall. She was curious<br/>about the source, but she decided not to investigate for several reasons. However, Akane<br/>didn't have any reasons not to, and soon ran past her with nary a glance and entered the<br/>garden to investigate. Still curious, Ranma figured she could find out what happened from<br/>her; so she waited.<p>A moment later, Akane returned, appearing to be a bit irritated. "What's up?" She asked her,<br/>feigning nonchalance.<p>"Oh, nothing..." Akane muttered in response, unhappy. "But I know that somebody ate<br/>blueberry pancakes this morning."<p>"Gross." Ranma commented, though finding it kind of interesting to find out what that other<br/>senshi ate. "I wonder why that is?" She questioned herself in thought.<p>"I know..." Akane agreed, then blinked when she realized just whom it was she was talking<br/>to. "When did you get back?" She inquired, taking in her fiance's disheveled appearance<br/>and torn clothing.<p>"Just a minute ago." Ranma answered, seeing that her fiancee was inspecting her.<p>After giving herself an inspection of her own, she found that, though that new power had<br/>healed her injuries, it didn't mend her clothes or cleanse her body of filth.<p>"So..." Akane started with slight interest. "Who won?" She hoped that Ryoga finally beat<br/>Ranma, trying as hard as he does.<p>"I did, of course." Ranma replied with a proud smirk. "I put him out with a smile on his face."<p>Akane didn't know what she meant by that last comment, but she did know another thing.<br/>"But it seems he really got you good this time." She observed, smiling. Let's see him deny<br/>that!<p>"Like you wouldn't believe." Ranma complained in admittance, surprising Akane. But only<br/>Ranma knew that it was because of Ryoga's distraction that caused the demon to inflict the<br/>worst of her bygone injuries, so it was, in a way, the truth. Then, not wanting to waste any<br/>more time, she added: "And I'd like nothing more than a nice, long soak."<p>Akane understood and allowed Ranma to walk away, but something conspicuous made<br/>itself known to her as she regarded her fiance's departing back. "Ranma?"<p>Turning about to face Akane, ceasing her progress toward the bathroom, Ranma wondered<br/>why she was looking at her so oddly. "Yeah?"<p>"Your hair..." Akane began uncertainly. "I didn't know you were growing it out."<p>"Huh?" Ranma responded intelligently, then grasped her pigtail and pulled it over her<br/>shoulder so she could inspect it. Almost immediately, she realized that her hair was indeed<br/>longer, and that her hair was plaited quite loosely at the base of her head and was showing<br/>signs of looseness down the rest of its length. It must have grown six inches!<p>Doing an excellent job at hiding her surprise (as far as she was concerned), she flipped her<br/>hair back behind her and unconcernedly said: "I didn't, either. Guess I haven't been paying<br/>attention to it lately."<p>Akane wasn't fooled, and knew that Ranma was hiding something; but she didn't pursue the<br/>issue. There was no way that she wouldn't have noticed that much hair growth "lately",<br/>which would have normally taken four to six months to occur. Something was going on, and<br/>Ranma was withholding information from her again. Well, like always, she'll just have to<br/>keep an eye on the idiot.<p>So, instead of making her suspicions known, she allowed her fiance to leave with a piece of<br/>advice as a parting gift. "Well, unless you want all the hassle that comes with longer hair,<br/>then I suggest paying more attention to it."<p>Ranma nodded, let out a mental sigh of relief, and continued on her way to the bathroom.<br/>When she was sure that she was out of Akane's sight, she quickened her pace, wondering:<br/>"What's going on?"<p>"The senshi are stronger than I remember."<p>The owner of the voice gripped the armrest of his wheelchair tightly, glaring out the sliding<br/>glass door and past the balcony it led to with bitter hatred. It had taken him two months to<br/>get the required energy to summon his first demon; and it had been his own energy, leaving<br/>him tired and weak the entire time. Fortunately, it wasn't a complete waste since he'd<br/>gathered enough energy to summon a stronger demon in half a fortnight. However, it would<br/>require his own energy to accomplish that.<p>"But I will destroy them." He vowed gravely. "I will NOT allow the Moon kingdom to<br/>re-establish its matriarchal rule over the earth again."<p>Turning away from the morning sun, he wheeled himself into his bedroom for another<br/>session of self-draining that would render him weak and tired for the remainder of the day.<p>"Never again." He muttered before he shut the door behind himself.<p>-<p>Chapter one - Part two: Consequences<p>Ranma discovers some of the many consequences that result from her choosing to become<br/>a senshi, and then discovers there was someone she knew that she really didn't know.<br/>Ryoga gets up on the wrong side of the stretcher.<p>Crescent Pulsar: I know that "he'd've" and "she'd've" aren't words, but they work in informal<br/>speech, so why not in writing? Well, even if someone told me not to use it in writing, I'd've<br/>done it anyway. As you can see. It's my prerogative as a bad writer.
