No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 4: Amazon Incidents and boiling tempers don't mix</b></p><p><b></b>The first morning after Genma's 'exile' went by quite well. No insults, no malletings, no accusations. Another reason for that was last but not least the verbal tongue lashing Akane had received as well from Nabiki as Kasumi. They had obviously made quite an impression on the youngest Tendo.</p><p><b></b>And it had been one hell of a talk between the sisters after Ranma's parents had left. Kasumi and Nabiki had literally dragged Akane to Nabiki's room, and the middle Tendo had even activated her recording devices. Sipping her morning tea Kasumi remembered yesterdays' conversation.</p><p><b><i>Flashback</i></b></p><p><b></b><i>Kasumi had turned towards her youngest sister. Akane had been seated on the bed, and she had still looked stubborn, but her anger had evaporated somewhat after three cups of Kasumis' special tea."Sis, do you know why you're here?" she had asked.</i></p><p><i><b></b>Akane had looked angry. "Because of the pervert. It's all his fault!"</i></p><p><i><b></b>Nabiki had directed a cool glance at Akane, one of those that said I can see your soul. "And how is it Ranma's fault? Oh, let me guess... because he led Kasumi on like he supposedly does with Shampoo and Ukyo?" she had asked sarcastically.</i></p><p><i><b></b>Akane had of course noticed the sarcasm, but she had had to defend her world-view. "Yeah. He always has those floozies hanging off of him. And he is such a pervert! That all makes me so angry!" she had replied, of course, angrily.</i></p><p><i><b></b>Nabiki had smirked. "And jealous, little sis?"</i></p><p><i><b></b>The youngest Tendo had nodded unconsciously. "Ye... no! Why should I care about the baka pervert?"</i></p><p><i><b></b>Before Nabiki could answer, Kasumi inserted her own thoughts. "Why do you still think that Ranma is a pervert? Hasn't he proven time and time again that he is not like the boys you had to defend against? Hasn't he risked his own life more often than one can count?"</i></p><p><i><b></b>"And hasn't he even killed for you to save you, little sis? What more proof of his trustworthiness do you need? Heck, he killed a freaking god for you, for Kami-samas sake!" Nabiki had said, and she had nearly lost her icy composure. The middle Tendo daughter had come to know the whole story due to her listening devices, and Kasumi had confirmed that the story was indeed true. Ranma <b>had</b> killed to save Akane. And a god to boot.</i></p><p><i><b></b>Akane however was not having any of it. "And I trusted him after that. I really did. I even really wanted to marry him, despite the fact that we were being pushed into it. But what good did that trust do me? After the wedding ended up in smoke those floozies began to throw themselves at him again. And he did and does <b>nothing</b> against it. How should I trust someone, the man I wanted to marry to boot, if he does not defend my honour? All he'd have to do was to solve this mess by taking a stand!" she had angrily exclaimed.</i></p><p><i><b></b>Kasumi had shaken her head sadly. "Did you ever take <b>his</b> feelings into account, Akane? Maybe Ranma did and does nothing because he does not want to hurt either Ukyo or Shampoo."</i></p><p><i><b></b>Before Akane had been able to retort Nabiki had added "See it this way. If he takes a stand, as you dubbed it, and dissolves all other obligations besides the one with our family, what would happen? I'll give you the answer, even free of charge. Today's my nice day." she had smirked. "First, Ukyo has an equally strong claim on Ranma as you. Would he dissolve the engagement, the Kuonjis would be entitled to declare a blood feud onto the Saotome clan. Nice, huh? And second, as for Shampoo, I know some of their laws. Should she fail in her quest to win Ranma, she will be punished severely."</i></p><p><i><b></b>Akane had shrugged. "Serves the floozy right."</i></p><p><i><b></b>The middle Tendo had fixed her younger sister with a stare. "Does it now? So do you really want to see Shampoo <b>dead</b>? Or trapped as a cat for the rest of her life? For that is what would happen. <b>That</b> is the punishment for failure in the Joketsuzoku tribe, and I doubt that even Cologne could do anything about it. She as one of the Elders would have to abide by their rules, as much as it would hurt her. And you know Ranma. Do you think he would let that happen? He who can't leave a kitty in a tree?" Then she had smirked as she had remembered Ranma's reactions towards cats. "Okay, bad example, but you catch my drift. Do you see now why he is so reluctant to solve this mess?"</i></p><p><i><b></b>Akane had nodded slowly. "I understand that now. But it does not change that he is the biggest pervert ever. And perverts can never be trusted. They have to be punished." she had said stubbornly and with conviction.</i></p><p><i><b></b>"But why do you see him as a pervert, Akane? Why don't you trust him?" Kasumi had asked.</i></p><p><i><b></b>And with that a long talk about trust and perversity had begun, and sadly, just like Kasumi had expected not even she and Nabiki had been able to convince Akane that Ranma was no pervert. Or that she could trust him. In her opinion there was just too much proof that he was and untrustworthy pervert. And due to her experiences she had made with the Hentai Horde and Tatewaki Kuno, which had really screwed up her perceptions, Akane had not been able to accept what her sisters had tried to tell her.</i></p><p><i><b></b>Inwardly Kasumi feared that Akane would never be able to trust any male because of the hellish experiences she had made with the Hentai Horde. Maybe it was time to convince their father that Akane needed professional help to overcome these nightmarish experiences. The oldest Tendo daughter had shuddered when she had thought about how a group of at least one hundred hormonal driven boys had attacked her sister every morning. She supposed that would drive anyone to not trust males.</i></p><p><i><b></b>And a boy who was to become her husband, and who was <b>allowed</b> to do 'perverted' things with her was so much worse, Kasumi mused. Add to it that Akane had never overcome what she had felt as a betrayal of her trust in Ranma when she had found out that the girl she had wanted to befriend had really been a boy. And a boy who then became her iinazuke to boot.</i></p><p><i>In the end Nabiki and Kasumi <b>had</b> been able to convince Akane to be nicer to Ranma, and the convincing argument had been, that Akane could not afford to treat Ranma like she had in the past, now that she was on probation. The point had been driven home that Akane had to give her all too if she wanted to have any chance at a relationship with Ranma. And that she wanted one despite her own denials was quite obvious. </i></p><p><i><b></b>Akane had grudgingly accepted, but Kasumi had seen that stronger calming herbs would still be needed. Badly. Her sisters' temper had always been a problem ever since their mother had died, and maybe it might prove to be her downfall…</i></p><p><b><i>End Flashback</i></b></p><p><b></b>Breakfast was just over, and Akane had decided to go on a shopping trip through the local mall with her friends Yuka and Sayuri. This suited Ranma just well, as he still wanted and needed time to himself for some serious thinking.</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo daughter for her part felt that she really had done everything she could to give her sister a chance to achieve happiness with her iinazuke. "You only notice what you had when it's gone..." she mumbled to herself and sipped from the cup of Darjeeling tea, thinking that she was alone.</p><p><b></b>"Run that by me again?" a voice behind her suddenly said. Nabiki.</p><p><b></b>"Oh my, I didn't notice you, Nabiki. I was just hanging to my thoughts." the oldest Tendo daughter said.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki, who was holding a cup of coffee in her right hand, smirked. "I figured as much, sis. What did you mean by that?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi looked her younger sister into the eyes. "I was just musing if we really have made it clear to Akane that she can't carry on the way she has. Auntie was <i>really</i> upset with her, and you know as well as I do that little sis is on probation."</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter looked grim at hearing that. "And that's exactly what 'Princess' deserves after the stunt she pulled in your bedroom. Not even <i>I</i> would have thought that one of her tantrums would go this far. And do you know how much it will <i>cost</i> me?" she asked, sipping her coffee.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi shook her head and sipped her tea once more, and Nabiki steamed silently at the prospect of losing yen for any reason. "30,000 Yen for a new bed and 20,000 Yen for repairing the damage to the floor. 50.000 Yen ¹, Kasumi! Only to prove that Ranma is a pervert despite the fact that we," she looked at her sister, "know that he isn't. He would have had so many opportunities to peek at us or Akane, and he <i>never</i> did. If anything, I'd say he was embarrassed when he saw me naked the times I walked in on him. No, he is no pervert. But he lives most definitely up to his name Ran Ma²." she said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>"Oh my!" Kasumi exclaimed with a blush.</p><p><b>'Thanks, Nabiki.'</b> Ranma thought to himself from his spot on the roof, while also blushing about the assessment of his endowment. <b>'Even if you don't know it, it means a lot.'</b></p><p><b></b>When the blush had receded, Kasumi nodded and commented on what Nabiki had said. "Yes, but you saw that it is apparently not possible to convince our little sister that he is no pervert. You know as well as I do that she really hates boys, and that includes Ranma. And we both know why."</p><p><b></b>Now it was Nabiki's turn to nod. "Kuno-baby."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded grimly, and Ranma nearly fell from the rooftop upon seeing this (for Kasumi) alien expression on her otherwise always so peaceful face. Still waters obviously really <i>did</i> run deep. "Yes, Tatewaki Kuno. How he came up with the moronic idea of the morning fights I will never know. And that he had the gall to promise something that was never his to promise in the first place! He and his Horde of Hentais have caused a deep mistrust in Akane towards <i>all</i> boys, and she will have a hard time to overcome it. Although I meanwhile doubt that she will <i>ever</i> manage it on her own. But what little sister has yet to realise is, that Ranma is not like those boys at school. That we did not manage to convince her yesterday that Ranma is no pervert and is nothing like those boys does not bode well."</p><p><b></b>Her younger sister nodded. "Moronic, yeah, but it was also highly profitable. And you're right, Ranma is not like the other boys at school. He himself has a female body, and he sure knows what a bunch of perverts the other boys are. From the rumours I have heard apparently all too well. But you have <i>no</i> idea how much money I made during the time of the morning fights."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi on the other hand sighed. "One time in your life you'll come to notice that money is not everything, Nabiki. Sure, it <i>is</i> important and necessary, but you should not allow money to rule your life. Else you'll never find true happiness. But we digress."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki interrupted after she had placed her empty cup onto the ground, and she noticed that Kasumi did the same. "No, sis, we <i>don't</i>. You have no idea of what lengths I had to go to in order to keep the dojo afloat. Had it been for dad, they would have liquidated the dojo a long time ago. And then came the two freeloaders a year ago."</p><p><b></b>At hearing this, Ranma, still perched on his spot on the roof, felt a jab to his heart. But he decided to hear the whole story before judging Nabiki and listened intently. <b>'Man, it is a time of revelations.'</b> he thought to himself as he listened in as Nabiki continued.</p><p><b></b>"What with what Ranma and the Panda can pack away, I had to find other ways to keep us afloat, as you well know. I'm only glad that Ranma never found out that I sold the pictures of his female half, and occasionally of his male half too on demand. Kuno always paid good money for pics of his pigtailed Goddess, and even if I still regret it, I <i>had</i> to do it. I realise that Ranma and almost everybody else must think me a money grubber and an extortionist, but that is the price that I must pay to keep the family going." she said with a sigh.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled a warm smile at her sister when Nabiki had ended and embraced her in a comforting hug. And despite her title as the Ice-queen she let herself be hugged. Fact that astonished the still roof-sitting Ranma. "I <i>know</i> what you had to do for the sake of the family. Believe me, sis, I do." Kasumi said. "But what <i>you</i> don'tknow is that <i>Ranma</i> knows too. He found out a long time ago that you sold pictures of his female half to Kuno and the other perverts. He also found out <i>why</i> you did it, and in order to help, he <i>allowed</i> that pictures of his female half were being made, as long as they were not <i>too</i> revealing. You see, only <i>one</i> Saotome is a freeloader. But he surely makes up for Ranma too." she said in a voice approaching anger.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki appeared to be shell-shocked, and that she was too. And it was a new state of mind for her, the Ice-queen of Furinkan High. One she did not like at all. "How... how do you know that?"</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo daughter smiled once more. "Ranma told me. We have talked a lot ever since I have started his training and we also did before, and you would be surprised about the depth of Ranma's character. Think about it, Nabiki. Ranma is a trained martial artist, and one of the best at that. Ask yourself this: do you <i>really</i> think it would not have been in his abilities to find the hidden cameras and remove them?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki felt like smacking herself. "Of course! Now it makes sense. I always asked myself why it was such a walk-over to take pictures of Ranma. Saotome, I owe you." she said, and on the roof-top one Ranma Saotome blushed pleasantly. To hear those words from Nabiki's mouth of all people was like seeing lead turn to gold. Equally seldom.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded. "But the best payment for Ranma would be if you'd treat him a bit nicer. He really makes an effort to be nicer to Akane, and I don't want you to jeopardise it. Ranma deserves happiness, and I hope he'll find it with Akane." she said.</p><p><b></b>Observant as she was, Nabiki heard the doubtful undertone. Silently she had to agree. If Akane did not stop acting like so angry and jealous and all around like a spoiled brat it might very well come to what Kasumi had silently said to herself. She however, for her part, would do her best to give Ranma and Akane a chance together. This she owed at least Ranma. Especially after what she had done before the wedding."I will, sis. You know the time when jiji used the strength sapping moxibustion on Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded, and Ranma, who was still hidden on the roof, listened with rapt attention. "Yes, Nabiki."</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter continued. "I don't know if you are aware of this, but in order to get the remedy for this Ranma came to me and asked me to take shots of his female form in panties and bra. And it embarrassed the heck out of Ranma. There and then I nearly gloated how the big macho squirmed while I made the shots, but over time I learned that Saotome is quite okay. Ever since your training he's become even tolerable. And he's definitely not what our sister accuses him off, and now it is up to Akane to prove that she can control herself enough to make it work between herself and Ranma. For what I've seen of Ranma, he's putting a Herculean effort into their relationship to make it work. I for my part won't interfere."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded. "He's a fine young man when he's not a girl. And I'm glad that you came to realise it. We can only pray to Kami-sama that Akane will realise it too before it is too late." she said cryptically.</p><p><b></b>A couple of days passed and, for a while, things were really different. Ranma and Akane both really tried to get along with the other. Granted, Ranma had really tried beforehand, but now Akane tried too. She tried to keep her anger and jealousy under control, and aside from the odd temper-overboil, which was always instantly defused by the other two Tendo sisters, everything went well.</p><p><b></b>Though it was apparently very hard for Akane to keep her temper under control, which had forced Kasumi to spike her usual tea with even stronger calming herbs. She had never resorted to such measures regarding her younger sister in the past before last week, but she had sworn to give it her all. Kasumi wanted to give Ranma a chance with Akane, so that both could find their happiness. That she had to resort to such means did not burden her conscience at all, for it was for the greater good of her family and for Ranma's happiness. And if anyone deserved happiness after what he had been through, then Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Thus she used the knowledge she had gained through her studies of the medical books she had borrowed from Tofu Ono over time. Now, she was well-versed regarding the usage of herbs. Why should she not apply all this knowledge and do something useful with it? If the calming herbs were needed to curb the temper of her youngest sister, so be it.</p><p><b></b>Though her doubts remained. What was it for a relationship that could persist through the scrutinies of life if it needed cheating like calming herbs? And Kasumi still missed any sign of trust on Akane's part for her iinazuke. But without trust, which relationship could persist? Despite that Kasumi pushed her doubts aside for Ranma's sake and continued her unperceived help.</p><p><b></b>And it worked to a certain degree, as Akane was not as angry and jealous as before. Her temper was still there, though it did not erupt as easily as before. But not much was said between Ranma and Akane. Both tried to be polite to each other, but one could tell that Ranma as well as Akane were walking on eggshells. It was as if one was waiting for a temper-explosion, and the other for an act of perversity. And only time could tell if the bomb would tick off without exploding.</p><p><b></b>Though one part of the fuze had already been dealt with. Ukyo had really kept her distance after Ranma had said to her that he still only saw her as his best friend and always would. Repeatedly. And with Akane at his side to prove it to her. He did not know if Ukyo had accepted it, but at the moment he did not care that much. He wanted to make it work out with Akane. Everything else could be dealt with later. And maybe Ukyo had seen <i>how</i> determined he had been.</p><p><b></b>But as so often, all good things must come to an end. And the reason for it was apparently that Shampoo had decided that Ranma had avoided her advances for far too long. Thus the Amazon had decided to claim her Airen once more with renewed vigour. The consequences of this visit would be far-reaching.</p><p><b></b>It was the second to last day Ranma had secretly granted Akane. It was a Saturday, and the Saotomes were visiting the Tendos. The day had started out beautiful, as a warm spring sun hung in a clear-blue sky. It was unnaturally peaceful for Nerima, which might have been a warning sign.</p><p><b></b>Anyways, after everything had progressed so nicely between Akane and Ranma, Soun had decided to invite Genma and Nodoka over to celebrate it over an afternoon tea and  the two old men were sitting at the Shogi board, while Ranma and Akane were training in the dojo. Nodoka was chatting with Nabiki, as Kasumi was in the cellar for some cleaning-duty.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Akane had just returned from the dojo to chip in some snacks (the legendary Saotome appetite had reared its head) when all hell broke  ringing of a bicycle bell was the first indicator that something was about to happen. The exclamation "NIHAO AIREN!" by you-know-who was much more explicit and announced impending disaster.</p><p><b></b>Seconds later Shampoo literally came through the wall, balancing bowls of ramen. "Shampoo bring too too good ramen. Airen take Shampoo on date now, yes?"she asked, smiling happily.</p><p><b></b>Everyone present blink-blinked. The Amazons had kept a relatively low profile for so long, except for the occasional glomping attempt and Mousse-related incidents. No poisons, no herbs, no drugs, as far as they knew. For over <i>three</i> months it had been <i>almost</i> quiet.</p><p><b></b><i>Why</i> could it not have lasted a tad bit longer? Not only Nodoka, who knew what was hanging in the balance, was asking herself this question. One more day, more would not have been necessary. Ranma could have decided without (much) interruptions if the engagement to Akane still had a chance. Why? Why had the Kami conspired against them?</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Shampoo had set the bowls of ramen onto the counter, and a second later Ranma found himself at the receiving end of an Amazon glomp. "Damn, Shampoo, leggo off me!" Ranma exclaimed. But as he only had one possible escape route, namely pushing her <i>there</i> in the chest, he could do nothing more than make his discomfort known  Akane would have malleted him for sure, not to mention the other, more severe consequences…</p><p><b></b>Naturally this episode caused Akane's blood to boil with anger and jealousy which not even the effects of the calming herbs could counter, and she did not even hear Ranma's exclamation of discomfort. All that she saw was Ranma squirming in Shampoo's glomp.</p><p><b></b>Her trigger-happy temper reared its ugly head, and not even the herbs which had tamed her temper somewhat before could prevent this explosion. Everyone present watched in morbid fascination as the mallet appeared in her waiting hands. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion, like in a bad dream.</p><p><b></b>Akane's battle aura flared red around her and even her eyes seemed to glow red, but instead of punting on the offending Amazon, Akane had her eyes set on the squirming Ranma. A Ranma who was apparently enjoying this Amazon glomp, gauging from how he rubbed against Shampoo's body.</p><p><b></b>She had been right and her sisters had been wrong! And everyone could see it! Ranma was nothing more than an unfaithful pervert! A pervert who had to be taught a lesson! <b>'So... he is <i>enjoying</i> this, is he? Let's see how he'll enjoy THIS!'</b> she thought. "RANMA... NO... HENTAI!" she yelled and punted Ranma with a hard swing through the roof and into LEO.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo voiced everyone's thoughts, even if not as eloquent as most present would do.</p><p>"Why violent kitchen destroyer bash Airen into orbit? Has you eaten Super Soba Noodles again? Too too much male hormones in violent girl?" she asked with a teasing smirk.</p><p><b></b>Akane fumed. "What does a <i>bimbo</i> like <i>you</i> know? He was a pervert with you again, he <i>deserved</i> it. And perverts can never be trusted, that's why they have to be punished!" she said with conviction, repeating the statement she had given in the talk with her sisters.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo was about to angrily retort, when she noticed that her Airen's mother Nodoka had obviously had enough. Ultimately. "No, you violent little girl, my son did <i>not</i> deserve how you treated him. Did you not see his discomfort? Those are not the actions of someone who enjoys himself. No offence, young lady." she said towards Shampoo.</p><p><b></b>"Shampoo take none." the Amazon said happily, her anger at Akane put aside for the moment. She obviously enjoyed how her rival was being put down a peg or two by her Airen's mother. Little did the Amazon know that it would be more than just that.</p><p><b></b>Akane was now fuming even more. How <i>dare</i> this mother of a pervert say something like that to her! She and a violent little girl? It had all been the perverts fault, and <i>she</i> was being insulted because of what he had done? No way! "Who <i>are</i> you to call <i>me</i> a violent little girl? I am a woman, not a girl! And I'm sure as hell not violent! Take that back!" she exclaimed in unthinking anger, and even Soun Tendo, who had always had Akane-coloured glasses over his eyes ever since the death of his wife Kimiko, gasped.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi stood routed to the spot, her mouth gaping in disbelieve. Never would she have believed that her temper could drive Akane to be <i>this</i> disrespectful towards a guest in general, and to the mother of her iinazuke in special. Sadly she shook her head. She had tried and given her all to ensure her sisters happiness, but she, Akane herself, had blown it. And there was nothing she could do or wanted to do to help her sister to get out of what was to come now.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki on her part was also visibly surprised that her sister had gotten so carried away. And about something that had not even been Ranma's fault to boot! She had been able to see it up close this time, and Ranma had <i>really</i> not enjoyed the Amazon glomp at all. There had been nothing about his behaviour that could be labelled perverted, for he had only tried to get out of the glomp without pushing Shampoo in the chest. Which would have been the only escape route available. And she knew exactly why Ranma had not chosen to use it.</p><p><b></b>Slowly she came to share Kasumi's opinion that Akane needed professional help to deal with her temper and trust problems. As much as she would weep after the Yen it would cost, it was obviously very necessary. It was now clear as the water in the once more reestablished Koi pond that Akane was not able to tame her temper by herself, and even the herbs Kasumi had used were obviously not effective enough. No, something had to be done.</p><p><b></b>In the meantime Nodoka bristled visibly, and everyone watched. Especially Genma cringed back in anticipation of what was to come. He had seen his wife wear <i>this</i> look before. It had <i>not</i> been pretty. Not by a long shot. Silently he sent a prayer for Akane to Kami-sama. She would need it, for she had gone too far this time.</p><p><b></b>Genma Saotome had always feared that Akane's temper might prove to be a problem, and it seemed that he had been right. But where was the problem? Soun still had two other daughters. So no worries here, thought Genma. His retirement was  would just have to take it slowly now and wait for the aftershock to pass.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Nodoka seemed to apply the soul of ice, for it grew progressively colder in the room. And then… "Who <i>I</i> am? I might have become your mother-in-law. But this train is due for you. For good, I might add." she said in an icy tone that chilled the whole room. "And <i>why</i> should I take back what I said? Obviously you <i>have</i> forgotten how to behave properly, girl. For your behaviour is surely not that of a woman. Else you would show your Elders respect."</p><p><b></b>She fixed Akane with an icy glare that would have been able to turn hell itself into a frozen wasteland and continued. "And how you treat my son is abominable! I would never have believed it had I not seen it with my own two eyes over the last months! I have tolerated it for his sake, because he asked it of me, but enough is enough! You are totally immature, self-centred and you have no control over your temper. I have now proof that I was right to doubt the wisdom of the engagement between yourself and him. For how should you two have a working relationship if you don't <i>trust</i> him? A relationship has <i>no</i> foundation without trust, Akane." she stated with her sternest expression and paused to take in a breath.</p><p><b></b>With fire in her eyes she continued a second later, not giving Akane a chance to respond. "And don't you dare call yourself a martial artist. Do you think breaking bricks makes you a martial artist? It takes <i>learning</i> to achieve a skill, and from what I have seen you are not willing to take the time to do so. You are nothing more than a well-trained <i>bully</i>, as your constant unprovoked malletings of my son prove! <i>Nobody</i> deserves to be hammered with a blunt object, and my son the least, after what he did for you! <i>My</i> child will <i>never</i> marry a violent, uncontrolled girl like you who won't appreciate him! The engagement between yourself and my son is off! For now and ever!" she finished.</p><p><b></b>Soun and Genma visibly cringed. No, this was not going as they had expected. Not by a long shot. Inwardly Genma shook his head. He had long since found out that a man could serve the moods of a woman far better by giving in to her. This way the man had his peace and quiet, while the woman had the good feeling to be right.</p><p><b></b>He had taught this wisdom to his son, and he had been proud at how the boy had applied his knowledge. Not once had he hit his iinazuke (okay, make that ex now) and he had always given in to her, even if with a fight, probably to save face. So where had it gone wrong? Obviously his son was not at fault this time, which was a new situation for Genma. He would have to brood about it.</p><p><b></b>The Tendo Patriarch, for his part, was slowly overcoming his shock. <i>Never</i> would he have believed that his Akane, his baby daughter, had obviously <i>really</i> no control over her temper once enraged, like she had been accused of in the past. He had thought that she was something of a tomboy, but this apparently ran deeper.</p><p><b></b>Her performance of some moments ago had really opened Souns' eyes. Instead of applying his well known waterworks in face of a bad situation the head of the Tendo household sunk into a smouldering fury. Akane's behaviour would have to be corrected.</p><p><b></b>And for the first time since Genma had brought Ranma into this house Soun Tendo asked himself if all what Ranma had obviously endured from his youngest daughter had been justified by his dream to unite the schools of the Tendo Ryu and the Saotome Ryu though the marriage of Akane and Ranma.</p><p><b></b>He had promised his wife Kimiko on her deathbed that he would ensure the future and safety of his daughters, and he had had to admit to himself that he had done an abysmal job at it. The card Genma had sent from China had been something of a life-saver for him. Through the promise they had made so many years ago, Soun had thought he'd be able to fulfil the promise he had made to his dying wife. Now, in face of how Akane treated Ranma and how she obviously always had treated him he was not so sure anymore.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo for her part was silently cheering. <b>'Too too stupid violent kitchen destroyer has dug own grave now! Too too good! One second, why do I think like that too? Aiyah, its time to return home to the village with Airen now that it has <i>finally</i> happened! This stupid country makes me go bonkers.'</b> the Amazon thought.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma (she had landed in the canal again) had reached the dojo once more via roof-hopping, and just in time to hear her mothers' statement. She was just about to enter the house, when Akane turned towards her father, also noticing Ranma in the process. "Dad? How can you let the mother of this<i> pervert</i>" she spat the word while looking at Ranma, who had meanwhile entered the kitchen, "say something like that about me?" she demanded, anger and fury still clouding her senses.</p><p><b></b>A second later Ranma literally glowered at her insulting ex-iinazuke. This time Akane had gone too far in her anger. Nobody insulted her mother! What feelings of love Ranma might have had left for Akane evaporated in this second. This was also the moment when the brutal reality sunk into Soun Tendo. For the first time he realised how many mistakes he had made regarding his youngest daughter.</p><p><b></b>He <i>had</i> been far too lenient with her and he <i>had </i>allowed her to lax in her training which <i>had</i> made her a bully, like Nodoka had accused. That he had never helped her to control her volatile temper now came back to haunt him, and his own fury was replaced by shame. Shamefacedly he bowed his head for a moment. Then he looked up, and directly into Akane's eyes with a hard glint in his own. "Akane, go up to your room. You are grounded until further notice." he said in a hard voice and without the slightest evidence of a tear.</p><p><b></b>One disbelieving look at her father told Akane that her father <i>really</i> meant business. Kasumi, who had just arrived from the cellar with an interesting looking casket exclaimed a soft "Oh my!"</p><p><b></b>Akane still looked at her father in stunned disbelieve. Had she <i>heard</i> right? Her own <i>father</i> was betraying her? The red haze before her eyes returned once more. It was all the Amazon hussies' fault. She would show her!</p><p><b></b>Ah, Kasumi had an appropriate object! "Give that here!" she yelled and grabbed the casket. She would douse the offending Amazon with whatever liquid it contained and make a catfur-rug out of her. <i>After</i> she had doused her with that liquid. "You will pay, Shampoo!" she yelled.</p><p><b></b>With a tug she ripped the water-casket from Kasumi and threw it at Shampoo in one fluid motion. But Shampoo was not a well-trained Amazon for nothing. She pulled out her bonbori from stuff-space and deflected the cask back at Akane in the blink of an eye.</p><p><b></b>But despite being a 'well-trained bully', as Nodoka had dubbed her, Akane was fast enough to avoid the flying object and ducked. But a certain someone, who was standing behind her, was not as lucky.</p><p><b></b>The casket hit the person in the head and spilled its contents over it. The results, however, were not as expected...</p><p><b></b>¹ sounds much, but its 'only' about 500 dollars.<br/>² means "wild horse"</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
