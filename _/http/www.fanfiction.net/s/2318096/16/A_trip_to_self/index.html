</div><p><b>Title</b>: A trip to self</p><p><b>Author name</b>: Trugeta</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by Rumiko Takahashi and VIZ as well as many others. No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 16: On the road</b></p><p><b></b>Next morning the two cursed individuals awoke together; at first Ranma cringed away from Kasumi in expectation to be hit because he had done something perverted. Then reality reasserted itself in his mind, remembering that he was not in Nerima any more; where nearly anyone would hit him at even the hint of physical affections.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi had, of course, noticed his reaction; a feeling of overwhelming sadness overcame her. How much Ranma had suffered, nobody had even known or realised it. Her father and 'uncle' Genma had always been too fixated on Akane's side of the story and had always believed her word over that of Ranma. So when Akane had treated him like the pervert she suspected him to be it had been perfectly alright.</p><p><b></b>But what nobody had taken into consideration was: how anyone, regardless how strong he or she was, would be affected by such constant treatment. Ever since Jusendo and the following months and events Kasumi knew that Ranma had been tired of this treatment, she was more than glad that his situation had finally improved.</p><p><b></b>Though obviously he would need some time to get used to it, as his instinctive and conditioned reaction showed. Well, she'd have to condition Ranma otherwise and replace the 'programming' Akane had given him.</p><p><b></b>And she would begin right now.</p><p><b></b>"Ranma-kun," she purred, "would you come over to me and warm me?" she asked with a flirtatious smile.</p><p><b></b>Only after a moments hesitation he complied. This was the woman he loved, the woman who had done so much for him, and he'd do anything for her. With a smile on his face he scuffled closer to Kasumi and put his right arm underneath her and pulled her close.</p><p><b></b>Instantly the oldest Tendo daughter snuggled up to him; when she leant into him a content smile settled down on Ranma's face. If life would be like this for the rest of his days; if waking up together like this every day was 'part of the package', then he'd be the luckiest man, woman, whatever in the world.</p><p><b></b>Glancing at Kasumi he noticed that she had an equally content smile on her face, and inwardly he mused how it was possible to love a single person so much without bursting to bits. He'd never felt like this for anyone before, and for the first time he felt what true love really was.</p><p><b></b>Why had his father denied him the option to find love on his own? If he'd had the choice in the engagement, if he'd had the opportunity to really get to know all three Tendo girls before actually considering an engagement, then he might have found this love even earlier.</p><p><b></b>But how so often in his life his father had had to screw up, throwing him unerringly at the one Tendo girl that liked boys the least. And how he'd hated the mindless pressure the fathers had exerted on him and Akane, and inwardly he could not really fault the youngest Tendo daughter for not wanting to marry him.</p><p><b></b>Granted, at the failed wedding she had really looked like she'd wanted to go through with it and marry him; but honestly, had she really wanted to marry someone she had been forced together with? How could anyone expect the parties of such an agreement to be happily married ever after? Especially if one of the parties was decidedly uncomfortable with the 'condition' of the other and had a dislike for boys in general?</p><p><b></b>Maybe Akane had loved him; but she had never trusted him, especially around the other girls. She'd accused him of being a pervert and doing 'perverted' things with them. Countless times. Her anger, her jealousy and her violence towards him had been too much to bear in the end. Not even her cute smile and her beauty had been able to counter those negative sides in the end.</p><p><b></b>Inwardly he hoped that he'd be able to make peace with Akane in the end, and maybe he could take her up on the offer she had made when they had first met. But this time with truly meaning it, abiding by it. And maybe he could learn some meditation techniques from the Shinto Priest at the Masaki's that would help in finding a key to control Akane's anger.</p><p><b></b>But right now he did not want to dwell on it, as he was lying side by side with the most beautiful woman of the planet. Slowly he turned to face her, and when he saw her gleaming and inviting brown eyes he could not resist the urge to kiss her. Much to her delight, apparently…</p><p><b></b>A heavy snogging session and an extensive breakfast later, thanks to the supplies they had received from the people they'd helped in Oume, they repacked the tent into Ranma's backpack and hit the road once more. Their plan was to stop by at the several shrines and holy places that lay on their way from the Yamanashi prefecture to Okayama, and in the following days they did just that as they crossed from prefecture to prefecture.</p><p><b></b>Although they had both tried to stay in their birthforms as much as possible and had frequently found occasions to explore their feelings further, there had always been the odd rain shower or splashing. And they, but foremost Ranma, had to accept that there was no way to stay in their birthforms as much as he wanted.</p><p><b></b>As long as they weren't locked they always were prone to changing, and after the first two days Ranma didn't really care any more about not showing as much affection to Kasumi when he was a she. What Kasumi had said had really hit home. But they limited the more further-going make-out sessions to their birthforms, but kisses and caresses were fair game while they were in their alternate forms.</p><p><b></b>Over the time they spent travelling they had stopped by at several shrines, and after Ranma had accepted that he could also show affection while they were not alone the Saotome youth felt, just how much his fathers teachings had limited him. Also being a she was not so bad any more without a certain stupid panda and his constant harpings to bother her.</p><p><b></b>The thing that had ticked Ranma off the most about the curse had always been the fact that the curse made the cursed individual such a damned water magnet. The constant splashing had always been a thorn in the side. And wet clothes generally did not really improve the mood after all either.</p><p><b></b>Thus were the thoughts of a somewhat wet Ranma who was carrying an also somewhat wet Kasumi-otoko. <b>'The Kami of Rain must really get a kick out of this…'</b> she thought to herself with a semi-amused shake of her head.</p><p><b></b>Ranma mused she really should have tested waterproof articles, rain-clothes or something to that effect. The companies would even have saved on hose pipes or swimming pools with her and she'd have made a good deal of money. Just let Ranma Saotome stand outside for a few moments, and something cold-water related like a nice downpour was bound to happen. Instant girl, just add water. Sometimes it was nearly comical, but Kasumi's company made it much more bearable.</p><p><b></b>Especially the first time they had changed together after they had hit the road again after the training was in fond remembrance for Ranma. While they had been travelling through Tokyo prefecture one of those odd downpours had occurred, and Ranma who had wanted to stay in birthform as much as possible so as to have the chance to get to know the female Kasumi even better had looked quite disgruntled when he had suddenly been a she, courtesy of a splashing.</p><p><b></b>But what Kasumi-otoko had done had been so cute. He'd looked at her with a smile, had given her a tongue-curling kiss and had asked "There, better now?" with a smirk, showing how much he liked to give in into his mischievous nature he had hid so long as a she.</p><p><b></b>The redheads only coherent response had been a shaky nod, so much she could remember. From then on she still had tried to stay male as much of the time as possible to have as much chances to make out with the female Kasumi, but every time they had changed Ranma had received such a kiss. After a while changing had not been so bad any more…</p><p><b></b>Shaking herself out of her musings she paid more attention to their surroundings. They were just passing through a forest which rapidly gave way to a wide, plain valley. Ranma took the time to get orientated, and she finally nodded to herself when she recognised the area from the map. Yes, they were not far away from the Gifu prefecture.</p><p><b></b>They were now in their second week of travelling and were not making as much progress concerning the covered distance at the moment as Ranma would have liked, but therefore they were making so much more progress regarding their relationship. And wasn't that as important as covering a certain distance, if not much more so?</p><p><b></b>For them this trip was also a trip to self, a trip to finding oneself and the other. And after only two weeks away from Nerima they had really made progress, as well regarding getting more used to their curses as regarding their growing relationship. In their case one could rightfully say that the journey was the reward.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had also begun to instruct Kasumi in the basics of her Art. Now she was always on the lookout for appropriate places to stop and show her love some more moves. The cursed martial artist nodded to herself. This would be the ideal area to start on teaching Kasumi some more moves. Some minutes later Ranma had arrived at the destination and let Kasumi get down.</p><p><b></b>Said cursed Tendo looked questioningly at Ranma. "Why the stop, Ranma-chan? Want me to carry you for a change?" he asked in jest.</p><p><b></b>Ranma actually giggled and nearly clapped a hand over her mouth until she remembered that it was quite alright for girls to giggle. And that she was now, a girl and there was no idiot panda to harp on her. Thus she continued to giggle. "I really like your true self, Ka-kun. The oblivious and selfless act you put up for the sake of your family really fell short. You know, I don't want a traditional Japanese wife, Ka-kun; I am hardly traditional myself. Just be yourself, the cuter you are."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko boggled. Ranma had practically voiced what he had been brooding about ever since she had been cursed. How on Earth should she be a traditional Japanese wife with a curse that turned her into a man? That was next to impossible!</p><p><b></b>And now Ranma said that she did not want such a wife. Did it mean that she did not want her? She had always acted like a traditional Japanese woman in the past. No, that could not be that. Ranma had practically said that he loved her, regardless of the form.</p><p><b></b>Seconds later the impact clicked. Due to the curse she had ceased to be a traditional Japanese woman. She now turned into a man, and it was her right to break free of the restrictions her family had put upon her. That was what the others had wanted to tell her/him! And he/she'd start with it right away!</p><p><b></b>After all, what had all this acting like a proper Japanese housewife brought her? She had been limited to the house while her sisters had experienced life and lived it to the fullest. Akane had even always done things her way, and father had never objected.</p><p><b></b>No, she would never go back to living that way again, and the curse would help her. "Thanks for the compliment, Ranma-chan. Sorry that I spaced off a bit; I had to think about something. What you said drove the point home that I can never be a traditional Japanese woman ever again because of the curse. And know what? I don't want to be one any more. I'm glad that you wouldn't want one anyway, though. I will try my best to break out of my shell, so to speak. This behaviour has been ingrained into me for a long time, but I'll try to get rid of it. After all, my two sisters never were traditional. And I have no reason to be any longer. Thank you for giving me the answer, my Ranma-chan."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled a dazzling smile, and seconds later the young lovers embraced and kissed. The cursed martial-artist did not find it strange any more to be kissed by a guy, after all, this was Kasumi. The person was what counted, not the body. And Ranma had taken this lesson to heart, as Kasumi-otoko noticed and enjoyed.</p><p><b></b>Two minutes of intense kissing and roaming the others body later both came up for air. "I really like that, Ka-kun. Thank you for loving me."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled. "I like it too. It is all I ever dreamed of and more. Thank you for loving me too."</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned at Kasumi-otoko's cleverness and leaned into another embrace. This way she had not had to say the 'l' word. And she really did love Kasumi; that had become clearer to her over the course of the weeks they had travelled. She loved Kasumi in both forms. She just couldn't say it as of yet.</p><p><b></b>Unbeknownst to Ranma she had not needed to say it. Kasumi-otoko had noticed from the glint in her eyes and the look on her face. Being Kasumi, s/he already knew those words, unformed from her love's mouth. "You know, it will be really hard on you to get used to the name for your cursed form. But I like Yoshiro. It has a nice ring to it." she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo smiled back. "You are right, Ranma-chan. It will be hard to get used to, and you already have an advantage over me."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked puzzled. "Huh? What do you mean?" she asked. Then she thought for a moment and it made click. "Of course! I only have to spell my name differently. That's what you meant."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. "Yes. Now, why did you stop here, love?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed at Kasumi-otoko calling her 'love'. It brought forth a number of unknown feelings in her, so she decided to concentrate on the question. "I stopped so I could teach you some more of the Anything Goes style, Kas-chan. I'll be showing you a new Kata today."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled at his love. Ever since the encounter with those gang members he really looked forward to improve his defence skills, and up till now Ranma had always found enough occasions to instruct him. "That's nice, love. I'm ready when you are."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled. "In order to be most effective I have to be a male when showing you the Kata. That's a lot easier."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. That was logical. "Good. Then I'd say we pitch up our tents and start a campfire to heat some water."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded, both getting to work. Some minute's later one tent was standing, as the other was deemed unnecessary. After all, Kasumi had decided that she would not be the proper Japanese woman any more, why should Kasumi-otoko be a proper Japanese man and sleep alone in his tent? It was also a lot more comfy and warmer to sleep snuggled up to each other, even if in separate sleeping bags.</p><p><b></b>While the fire was heating the kettle with water Kasumi-otoko had prepared; the young lovers had once more time for another make-out session. Ranma had been rapidly losing her distaste for physical contact she had developed from the Amazon glomps and other unpleasantnesses ever since they had admitted their feelings.</p><p><b></b>In fact, she had nearly overcome them the first time they had hugged. The pleasure of a shared hug had been a thousand times greater than all Amazon glomps she had received in her life. And she was now thoroughly enjoying their make-out sessions. Who would have thought that physical contact could be so much fun?</p><p><b></b>Presently Ranma and Kasumi-otoko were kissing the life out of the other. If Nodoka could have seen them, she would probably have squealed "Grandchildren!" and fainted. It would be interesting to know if the Saotome matriarch would agree to the idea of a pregnant Ranma. Not that any of the two had that in mind, least of all Ranma. But from the way those two kissed an objective observer would have guessed that Nodoka would have good chances with grandchildren from those two…</p><p><b></b>If Genma Saotome had seen the display he would have either blown a fuse at seeing his manly son, even if currently a very beautiful girl, kiss a guy, even if it was Kasumi. Or he would have celebrated the joining of the schools. You pick.</p><p><b></b>But as none of them were present, Ranma and Kasumi-otoko were enjoying their peace and quiet, a heavy make-out session included. When the lovers finally separated to take in some very much needed oxygen both had very pleased smiles on their faces. This was so good! Inwardly Ranma wondered whatever Akane could have had against something this good.</p><p><b></b>If even Kasumi was enjoying this, and had repeatedly told her that it was nothing perverted, then what the heck was perverted about kissing, caressing, touching and stroking? For the life of her, Ranma could not figure it out. Well, Akane's loss.</p><p><b></b>Luckily Kasumi was very different from Akane. And it was good to find out that the old saying still rang true, still waters were deep. <b>'What will it be like once we are married?'</b> Ranma caught herself thinking.</p><p><b></b>Mentally she 'eeped!'. Marriage! She had been thinking about marriage, of all things. Yet the idea of a marriage to Kasumi did not bother the boy turned girl. Yes, their relationship was really progressing fast, and that was not a bad thing either. Rather the opposite.</p><p><b></b>A minute and some kisses later the kettle was finally heated, and Ranma upended it over her head once it had cooled down enough.</p><p><b></b>And with that Ranma-otoko started to teach Kasumi-otoko a new Kata of the Anything Goes style.</p><p><b></b>As Kasumi had been trained by her father in the Tendo Ryu and had started practising again some time ago this was a good foundation to build upon. When you added the training Cologne had given to Kasumi-otoko, it was safe to say that the cursed Tendo had a good starting base.</p><p><b></b>That he also had a very good learning curve, as Ranma had soon found out surely did no harm. Ranma had to correct some of the moves of the Tendo Ryu Kata Kasumi-otoko was presently doing as warm-up. That was due to the fact that he had done them before as a female.</p><p><b></b>Now, in male form, a block had to be modified here and a blow or kick to be changed there. Ranma also explained the reason why he was doing so. "You know, a move might be one-hundred percent correct and efficient when done as a female, but due to the difference in strength and proportion it might be a disaster in male form. Kas-chan, you had to adapt your balance completely after you received the curse, remember?"</p><p><b></b>At Kasumi-otokos nod he continued. "And you surely noticed the greater strength and reach of your male body, right?" again a nod. "Good." It was also a good thing that this was not Akane he was teaching.</p><p><b></b>Alone for implying that girls could be physically weaker, which they were, considering the muscle mass and density, would have been reason enough for her to give him a severe malleting. "This is why the Kata has to be adapted in order to take advantage of your male body's' strengths. A male body has usually more strength and endurance than a female body, whereas the female has advantages regarding speed and pain tolerance. One has to adapt a Kata to the different strengths of the gender, else one may in for a nasty surprise in a fight."</p><p><b></b>And that he did. Ranma demonstrated the new and adapted Kata from the Saotome Ryu and showed Kasumi-otoko the difficulties. Then he had him repeat the Kata and corrected mistakes here and there. When he noticed that Kasumi-otoko was tiring after an especially difficult Kata he put a stop to today's training and let it taper off with some stretching exercises.</p><p><b></b>As it was late evening by now that was more than enough for the day, and an exhausted Kasumi-otoko was glad when he could stop. Once the water was sufficiently heated he changed back into a she; after all, there was still enough energy left for furthering the exploration of their feelings...</p><p><b></b>Thus the two called it a night and went to their tent. An all-around enjoyed snogging session later the two cursed individuals were lying side by side, again in separate sleeping bags, but snuggled up to each other. Softly fondling each other they talked silently about their curses, and Ranma looked thoughtful when Kasumi admitted that she was slowly becoming indifferent to which form she was in.</p><p><b></b>He himself had not made as much progress as of yet, but Kasumi had never had such a misogynistic father who had filled her head with all sorts of stupid ideas. Kasumi saw the look on his face when she had said that, and she mused that the locking might indeed do Ranma good.</p><p><b></b>Hopefully living as a girl for some time would help her love overcome the last oddments of the misogynistic crap Genma had taught Ranma; she on her part would do everything in her power so that her love would enjoy this time. And when she said that it did not really matter to her if she was male or female, as long as kissing and making out made so much fun, Ranma could not hinder the blush that crept on his face.</p><p><b></b>But he had to admit that she was right. Now he had someone with whom he could share his cold-water experiences, and on their way from the Mlao plains to where they were now, some distance away from Gifu city, they had made quite a few already.</p><p><b></b>A sudden downpour here or a passing car driving through a puddle , and not to forget the ladle-ladies which seemed to exist in every city. But due to the fact that Kasumi had joined in the cold-water-part of the curse it was all not so bad any more. Especially considering the kisses Ranma received after changing each time, in the meantime even in public, made it all so much more bearable.</p><p><b></b>The whole splashing had also impressively underlined why they would stay locked in their cursed forms when they reached their destination. But for now using the soap to do so was out of the question, for Ranma wanted to appear at the Masaki house in his male form. After all, Tenchi only knew the male Ranma, for he surely had never heard of Jusenkyo curses.</p><p><b></b>One smile from Kasumi ignited the urge to kiss Kasumi again, and it was a good thing that they were lying in separate sleeping bags. They had deemed this a necessary precaution for a simple reason: they could not trust their hormones.</p><p><b></b>As honourable as both were, who knew if passion would not get the better of them? It was already hard enough to stop in time. But none of them thought about stopping their make-out sessions altogether, not at all. Those shared moments were simply too good.</p><p><b></b>From time to time, with a bit of pity, Ranma thought about what Akane was denying herself. Honestly, she should sue Tatewaki Kuno and those members of the Hentai Horde, but good. Those perverts and 'the scion of house Kuno' had screwed her perceptions up so bad, so that she'd regard a simple and most enjoyable kiss as something perverted.</p><p><b></b>How on Earth should Akane ever have a normal and happy relationship with how she was acting and reacting? In his heart Ranma knew that she needed help, and professional help at that. Nobody, regardless how strong one was, could escape what Akane had gone through on a daily basis unscathed. And although the morning fights had been over and done with for nearly over a year now, the effects were much more long-lasting as it seemed and as Ranma had come to know.</p><p><b></b>And that made Ranma angry. Everybody should have a chance to feel as happy as he and Kasumi were feeling now. For what would happen if Akane met Mr. Right, and at the first hint of affection the poor guy ended up clobbered? No, once they were back he'd help Akane. But right now he was enjoying himself too much to think of anything any more…</p><p><b></b>Next morning Ranma and Kasumi awoke side by side, only divided by their sleeping bags. The cursed Tendo girl smiled at her love, and she was delighted when he did not flinch back like in the past but actually smiled back at her. It had taken some time but finally they'd made enough progress. With an even bigger smile she snuggled up to him, and a now equally big smiling Ranma laid his arm around her and drew her even closer.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi was enjoying the comfy warmth Ranma was giving off, and if she had been a cat she would have purred from contentment. Silently she prayed to Kami-sama that their mornings would always be like this, and in moments like these she was very happy that she'd been forward enough to admit her feelings for Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Silently she mused that she'd probably never have had the guts to do so had she not been cursed, and she'd asked herself repeatedly if auntie had not been right. Maybe it had really been fate that she'd been cursed, and with the opposite curse of Ranma's to boot. They did indeed make the perfect couple now, and in the meantime she was slowly getting used to having 'different parts' when in her cursed form. Though some reactions of her male form did still surprise and embarrass her, but for her own sanity she did not want to dwell on it too much…</p><p><b></b>But fact was that kissing and holding Ranma was one of the greatest things ever, regardless of the form. She'd also realised that Cologne had been right; her perceptions were different when she was a he. Especially when she'd held Ranma in her male form after the incident in Oume had been over she'd felt like she in her male form had been the one protecting Ranma, giving her comfort. And being able to give comfort, protection and support to the strongest person you knew had really been something else.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi felt that they were the ideal supplementation to the other in both forms, and it was great how complementary they were to each other in many ways. She was learning how to defend herself as good as possible, while Ranma was still learning better manners and continued to catch up regarding school.</p><p><b></b>To this end they had also taken several school books with them, thanks to the huge backpack Ranma was carrying. And now that his stuff-space had been vastly improved he'd stored the books there to keep them from being damaged. Thus, when they were not travelling Ranma showed her his art and instructed her in it, and in exchange she continued to tutor him.</p><p><b></b>And when they were travelling Kasumi would ask her love questions about what he (or occasionally she) had learned, and to her delight Ranma was improving more and more. Both had agreed that they'd also use the occasion to teach the other how to be a man respective a woman when they were in their cursed forms, but both also agreed that the real teaching part regarding this would start once they were locked.</p><p><b></b>Her musings were cut short when she noticed how her love began to softly stroke her hair, and let his hand wander downwards to massage her. It had not taken him long to find all the spots where she really liked to be touched, and like with every technique Ranma learned, it had not taken him long to become damn good at it.</p><p><b></b>And when his warm hand slid under the top of her PJ and onto her back to massage her bare skin she purred with pleasure. "Mmmmmh… this feels good, Ra-kun. More of it." she whispered.</p><p><b></b>And with a smile Ranma complied. "Anything for you, milady." he said, and the smile reached his voice.</p><p><b></b>During the massage Ranma had also time to hang to his own thoughts. <b>'It might sound selfish, but that Kasumi got the curse was the damn best thing that could have happened. Because of that we got out of the house and away from Nerima, admitted what we felt for each other, she helped and still helps me bringing down my barriers, and… oh Kami-sama! I love her more than anything in the world! Damn, she loves me even with my curse, loves me in both forms! And I love her so much that it is a miracle that I haven't been blown to bits by the sheer power of my feelings. Why pops wanted me to keep feelings like these down I'll never know. I hope mom will set him right but good!'</b> he thought with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had been so absorbed in his thoughts so that he had not noticed how Kasumi had leant onto her left side, and suddenly his hand was touching her right breast. In the past he would have blushed, stammered incoherently and probably been clobbered, but in the last two weeks things had changed, and Ranma knew that he had not done anything perverted.</p><p><b></b>They were a couple, and couples did such things. Thus he left his hand in place, leant closer to her and whispered into her ear "I can't thank Kami-sama enough for you, you know that, you most beautiful woman in the world."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi leant on her back and smiled up at him. "Thank you, Ra-kun. I love you."</p><p><b></b>Ranma's smile deepened, and when he moved his hand he heard a soft intake of breath from his love. "Is anything wrong, Kas-chan?" he asked worriedly.</p><p><b></b>However, Kasumi just smiled. "It's nothing much. Only my breasts are a bit sensitive, is all."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth was now admittedly more knowledgeable regarding this area, but right now his expression betrayed his cluelessness. Kasumi laughed softly at this, and enlightened him. "This happens when I'm about to start my period, love. The breasts grow somewhat in size and get much more sensitive and hurt occasionally. But it's nothing to worry about, rather the contrary, it's perfectly normal."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded slowly as he remembered what his mother had told him about that specific topic. Deep inside he still hoped that this specific cup would pass him by as he still was not completely convinced that his girl-half was a real girl, despite what the others said. He'd wait and see. "I understand, Kas-chan. Mom told me some about it when she gave me the 'talk', but it seems as if there's a lot more to being a woman than I thought. Hmm, mom also mentioned that there's the chance that I'd get a migraine when I start. How is it in your case? Anything I should know?" he asked with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled back. It was a very good thing that Ranma knew more about sexuality at last. This was also one of the reasons why she had been tempted on more than just one occasion to make a panda-stew out of a certain baka panda. How could anyone be so irresponsible and not give his child the 'talk'? Honestly, stupid panda. "Thanks for you worries, Ra-kun. Normally I wouldn't tell this to anyone, but you are different, for you are the person I love. Yes, I get a migraine and flushes when I have my period, but I live through it. You get used to it after some time, and many more women in the world have the same problems. And there's always Midol." she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had a thoughtful look on his face. "Damn, I knew I had forgotten something. Mom mentioned that too. She said that my first time as a girl could be quite hard, so I should have a good supply of Midol at hand. But up till now I forgot to buy it, as I won't lock myself for still some time. But I completely forgot about you. Sorry."</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo daughter softly stroked his cheek and smiled at him. "How should you have known? It's not as if I go around and tell people 'Hey, today's the day I'll get my period.'. So don't worry about it, Ra-kun."</p><p><b></b>Suddenly Ranma's face lit up with a smile. "It's simple. We'll buy some Midol in the next apothecary we come across. Its only 100 miles till we reach Gifu city, so we should be there this afternoon."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled despite the fact that she knew that it'd be too late by then. She'd probably start some time around the morning, and she already had a pad in place. And thank Kami-sama that they had bought briefs. With boxers it would have been next to impossible to hide it, and those briefs were actually nearly as good as panties. "That is fine, Ra-kun. And don't worry about me. It's just my period, and you can be sure I won't die from it."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked at her in mock-worry. "Are you sure? Hmm, maybe we can take up preventive measures to lessen the risk…" he said and leant down to kiss her.</p><p><b></b>His love smiled in response, and the next snogging session took place. Afterwards they got up and dressed, then breakfast was prepared and consumed, and finally they were on their way again. But after half of the way Kasumi's face suddenly scrunched up, and she knew that her monthlies had arrived.</p><p><b></b>And the migraine that settled in was nothing short of the mother of all migraines. <b>'Damn,'</b> she thought, and uncharacteristically for her she swore, <b>'why has that to happen now when I'm enjoying myself so much? Now that's no fair!'</b></p><p><b></b>Ranma, who had lost a good deal of his cluelessness in the past months noticed her changed mood and her pout and stopped his run to look at her. "Is it what I think it is?" he asked cautiously.</p><p><b></b>With an unhappy expression Kasumi looked at him and nodded. "Yes," she admitted, "and I admit that the headache is slightly worse than the ones in the past. But I will survive." she said with a smile. "I bet it has something to do with getting my period for the first time after receiving the curse. So don't worry about it, Ra-kun."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth did not like that his girlfriend was uncomfortable, but if she said that she'd be okay, who was he to doubt her? After all, he'd have to trust her to know what was best for her. "If you're sure, Kas-chan. I will speed up a bit anyway so that we reach Gifu city a bit sooner. So tighten your hold, next stop: Gifu city." he said with his trademark grin and off they were.</p><p><b></b>During the run they noticed something interesting. One of the meanwhile customary downpours occurred, but instead of changing like Ranma, Kasumi remained female. Fact that astounded both cursed individuals. In fact so much, that Ranma let Kasumi down to the ground, gaping at her like a fish out of the water. "What the hell!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi, who was as surprised, waggled a finger at her despite said surprise. "Language, love. But else you're right." she admitted with a slight smile and then scrunched up her face in contemplation. "Hmm, I can only think of one explanation: the ovulation is one of the most important processes in nature, and apparently so important, that not even the curse magic can or will interfere. This means that changing back into a man to 'outrun' the period is out of the question else one stays a guy and avoids getting splashed. Which is next to impossible as we know."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked somewhat disgruntled. "So that means that if I have started my time and get my period again afterwards, I will be practically locked for the duration of the period. Meh. But I know, I know… all girls go through it, and so will I." she said with a sigh. "But I bet the tomboy will burst a gut when she hears this. The great macho Ranma Saotome locked as a girl because of her period. Great." she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Now Kasumi looked anything but amused, and the scolding that followed had also a lot to do with period induced mood-swings. "Ranma Saotome, you take that back! My little sister may be temperamental at times, but she would never make fun of you in a matter of this. Yes, she has made a lot of mistakes and has a lot to learn, and how she treated you was abominable, but she's still my little sis, and I love her. So apologise."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl looked somewhat chagrined. "Sorry, Kas-chan. The last months were so hard for me, and I still have difficulties to handle what has happened. You know how she thinks of me, as the most macho and most perverted being under Kami-sama's sun. So is it so farfetched to assume she would react this way?" she asked in a small voice.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi's sensitive antennae picked up the signals despite her hormonally induced mood-swings, and moments later Ranma found herself in a hug by a sniffling Kasumi. "Forgive me, love. Sometimes I forget the full extent of what you lived through, and you must understand that a sister can't jump over her own shadow. I love Akane, and I've always tried to protect her, but you're right, she might react the way you said." she admitted.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled up at Kasumi and gave her a soft kiss on the cheek. "'Tis okay, Kas-chan. If I had a sister or a brother I'd probably try to protect her or him as much as I could too. Now let me change back so that we can carry on." she said, while she marvelled that kissing Kasumi as a girl when Kasumi was a girl too had felt incredibly soft. Then she reprimanded herself for these perverted thoughts and prepared everything to change back.</p><p><b></b>The eldest Tendo daughter nodded, and after Ranma had changed back into a male they continued their travel for their destination of the day, luckily undisturbed by any more odd downpours. Kasumi was quite absorbed in thought while she was being carried by her love, for what Ranma had said had hit home.</p><p><b></b>Akane would probably have reacted this way, and she dearly hoped that her father would finally get her little sis some help. She, herself, only began to realise ever so slowly what a great impact their ignorance of mothers' death had had on the family and her.</p><p><b></b>Honestly, how could they have carried on after mothers' death like nothing had happened? Now that she had an outside view on it she saw how idiotic that had been. Especially little sis would have a hard way to come to terms with mothers death, and inwardly she was convinced that this was also one of the roots for Akane's constant anger.</p><p><b></b>Her baby sis was still angry at her mother for 'abandoning' her, and due to the way how they had carried on after her death Akane never had had the chance to come to terms with it. None of them had. Nabiki had incarcerated her feelings in ice; Akane had gotten more and more temperamental and due to the morning fights more and more violent; and she, herself, had suppressed any of her own hopes and wishes for the sake of the family.</p><p><b></b>Even during her own highschool time she had had little time for her friends, as she had had to take care of the household. But now, due to a single incident everything had changed. Who would have guessed that getting cursed would have had this effect? And she had to admit to herself, ever since she had received a male side she was acting a lot more forward, even in her female form.</p><p><b></b>This might have to do with a biological effect she had read of. When two people fell in love, the testosterone levels of the female would rise to match those of the male in order to make them more compatible while the testosterone levels of the male would decrease. And as she was very much in love with Ranma, and due to her cursed form, she mused that she had a lot of testosterone. This would also explain why Ranma was beginning to feel better in his female form, as the same applied to Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Her curse might turn out to be a blessing, and if she could manage to get Ranma used to the curse fully, they could indeed become one of the happiest couples alive. It had helped Ranma a lot that she had kissed her in her male form after they had changed every time, for it also showed Ranma that she really did not care about the form.</p><p><b></b>True, it had been different in the beginning to kiss a girl, but this girl was still Ranma. And as she loved the person Ranma, she also loved the girl Ranma, and by this logic it was becoming progressively easier to kiss Ranma and make out with her. That Ranma was very attractive surely did help too…</p><p><b></b>Also, decency was kept, thanks to their opposite curses. She was still having troubles with the concept to kiss girl-Ranma while she was a girl herself, but as they were in opposite forms except apparently for the time of their periods this was something she didn't want to think about much.</p><p><b></b>True to Ranma's prediction they reached Gifu city in the late afternoon, and for once they even had been spared by the Kami of Rain. Gifu City, their destination for the day, was located almost in the centre of Japan, about 250 km west of Tokyo, and about 140 km east of Osaka. The city itself was situated in the northern part of the fertile Nobi plain that was created by the Nagara Kiso and Ibi rivers.</p><p><b></b>But the two did not stop to enjoy the sights. The first thing they did was to stop by at the local apothecary to buy a nice supply of Midol and other period-related articles. They also bought some additional supplies at a local supermarket to stock up on their dwindling supplies of food.</p><p><b></b>Once they were done the two cursed individuals spent their time to look at the sights, and especially Ranma marvelled at the fact that his own country had a lot worth to be looked at. Once they had had enough of the sights Gifu city had to offer, the two lovers made their way to a local restaurant.</p><p><b></b>Aside from the money they had gotten from Nabiki they had also received some money from Nodoka. And Kasumi had taken some of her savings with her on the trip too. Thus they were able to enjoy a quiet and romantic dinner for two.</p><p><b></b>The waiter was even so thoughtful to light a candle for them, and when he did both cursed individuals smiled at each other and held hands in their booth. It was moments like these that made them feel like the luckiest people alive. Being in love was so great, and that Ranma was meanwhile able to express his emotions and affections was enough to make Kasumi the happiest woman in Japan.</p><p><b></b>Her Ranma was a treasure, and she loved to discover more and more new sides to him. She had known that he had the remarkable talent to learn a technique just from seeing it, but it obviously worked for other fields too. She had noticed that he was constantly watching people they came in contact with in order to learn from them and their behaviour, behaviour he deemed decent, of course. And thus Ranma was getting more and more attentive towards her.</p><p><b></b>The way he touched her, the way he kissed and the way he looked at her were more than enough to make her melt. Ranma had always had his charm, but in the past he had had nothing to back it up. He had not known what he was supposed to do with women, but he was learning. Rapidly. And that much to the delight of a certain Kasumi Tendo.</p><p><b></b>But she had learned a lot herself, too, she mused as she ate her rice at a proper pace. Ranma, who presently ate like a well-mannered human vacuum, was a very good sensei, and one thing was for sure, he was nothing like Genma in that regard. No taunting or insulting during their sessions, only calm and controlled behaviour with a loving undertone towards her. It was apparent that Ranma had finally thrown most of the teachings of his father out of the window where they belonged, and she was proud that she had been able to do her part in it.</p><p><b></b>Though something had to be done about Genma Saotome. She knew that she wanted to become engaged to Ranma if he wanted her, and she also knew that she wanted children with her Ranma. Somehow she was sure that Ranma wanted the same; and if that was really the case, well, then Genma Saotome would have to be removed from the equation. There was no chance in hell that she'd endanger her kids by exposing them to the influence of that man.</p><p><b></b>He had nearly ruined Ranma's life for good with his marriage agreements and teachings, if they could be called so. Kasumi knew that it would be hard on Ranma, because she knew that he still loved his father for some reason. But was this love reason enough to endanger their future children? Certainly not. With a sigh Kasumi mused that she'd cross this bridge when she had to. Maybe auntie would somehow learn of the many failings of her husband and send him to where the pepper grows.</p><p><b></b>Ranma, on his part, had noticed the introspective mood of his girlfriend. "Is something the matter, Kas-chan?" he asked with care in his voice.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled at him. He was always so worried, so caring. Damn, if only Akane knew what a catch she had had… "I was just thinking about some things, Ra-kun. Nothing of immediate importance, just some… things."</p><p><b></b>Her companion nodded. "Me too. You know, as strange as it sounds, but you're the first woman I have met with whom I really could imagine to settle down. With you, Kas-chan, I feel complete, whole, as strange as that may sound. The mornings we have woken up together were the greatest moments in my life up till now. I like you more than words could ever express, Kas-chan, and I am very happy that we went on this trip."</p><p><b></b>That said Ranma leant forward and kissed a merrily smiling Kasumi. A two-minute lip-lock later Ranma smiled at her. "We have to work on your endurance, Kas-chan." he said teasingly.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi knew where he was coming from, and creased her brows in mock-annoyance. "Oh you! Ranma Saotome, you are impossible!" she exclaimed, and tried to look stern.</p><p><b></b>However, she failed utterly in face of a smirking Ranma, and after about five seconds she collapsed laughing. "I know. That's why you love me." he said with the air of the arrogant and macho chauvinist he was said to be while he slicked back his hair, which cracked up Kasumi even more. Not being able to hold his own laughter in any longer Ranma soon gave in to the hilarity too and afterwards the two continued to enjoy their meal.</p><p><b></b>Some time later they finished the meal and kissed once more before they paid and left the restaurant. As it was 7 p.m. already there was little chance to reach the next prefecture, and thus Ranma consulted the map for a suitable resting place for the night. When he had finally found one he scooped Kasumi up in his arms and off they were.</p><p><b></b>Once they had pitched up the sole tent again after reaching their destination both engaged in some light training which lasted for three hours. Then they lay down on the ground in front of their tent. As it was a starry night and still quite warm they enjoyed watching the stars in the open air.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi's head rested upon Ranma's chest, and both cursed individuals had content smiles on their faces. This trip was turning out better and better… "Did you really mean what you said in the restaurant, Ra-kun?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma turned his head towards her. "What?" he asked, clueless at first. "Oh!" he then exclaimed, "You mean if I really want to settle down with you, right?"</p><p><b></b>"Yes." was the answer of the cursed Tendo daughter, "Did you really mean that, with everything that would come with it?" she asked, daring to hope.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth nodded and stroked her hair. "Yes, Kas-chan. I meant it. But let us talk about what it means when we are ready for it." he said, and let his hand wander trailed down the side of her body.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi suppressed the urge to giggle at the ticklish feeling. "Okay, my love. But I think we should talk about that topic again once we are both ready. Which will be if we consider an engagement and a wedding, should it ever take place." 'Which I hope it does.' she added as a thought.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled. "You know, I would not be opposed to a wedding should it take place after I have finished college or earned my first ten million yen." he said half in jest.</p><p><b></b>"Hand on that?" Kasumi asked with a smile while she turned to face her love.</p><p><b></b>"You mean that in earnest, Kas-chan?" Ranma asked incredulous.</p><p><b></b>She nodded empathically. "I like the conditions. As I said, I never would want to pressurise you into anything. If you say you would be ready for marriage after college," Kasumi paused for a moment and smiled, "or after earning your first ten million Yen, then I'd be more than glad. And I love you and want to marry only you if you one time decide so."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled. "Okay, hand on that." he said and held out his right hand. "And yes, I am pretty sure that one time I will ask you. I like you, I like you a lot." he said, and his eyes betrayed that he more than just liked her.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi took the hand and shook it, then gave the hand a soft kiss. She had understood the non-verbal message he had sent, and was happy. On the other side she was also angry at a certain panda, which had voluntarily crippled his child socially and emotionally. But they were working at it… "We'll see what comes about first. College or earning the Yen." she said in jest.</p><p><b></b>Ranma laughed. "Knowing my luck the ten million Yen. Not that it would be a bad thing, mind you. But you know what? Anything could happen, knowing my life. Look at how often it rains upon me, and by proxy on you. It bet the Kami of rain must really get his kicks out of it." he said.</p><p><b></b>As if to prove his words, a sudden downpour occurred, and the two cursed individuals got up and sprinted towards the tent. It was however to late for Ranma, who was now once more Ranma. Growling slightly to herself she dried herself of with a towel under the amused vista of Kasumi, who had not changed due to her period.</p><p><b></b>Pouting prettily Ranma lay down on her sleeping bag with her hands folded behind her head. "See what I mean? With me, anything could happen. Sometimes I really think I did something really bad that pissed of a Kami. And I mean not that I was forced to kill Saffron." she grumbled.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi lay down beside her and turned her face towards her. "I don't mind, love. Life with you is bound to be interesting, but you know what? I have never felt so alive in my whole life like in the past two weeks. And this is all thanks to you." she said, and kissed Ranma on the cheek.</p><p><b></b>Then Kasumi drew the smaller girl closer to her and hugged her. Ranma was hard pressed to suppress a nosebleed at the feeling of Kasumi's breasts being pressed against her own. This was a very odd feeling, odd, but also nice. However, she noticed that Kasumi seemed to be somewhat uncomfortable, and Ranma remembered the sensitive part.</p><p><b></b>Thus she softly freed herself from the embrace and turned around to face away from Kasumi. The other girl smiled at the thoughtfulness of her love, and once Ranma had laid down again she hugged the smaller girl from behind.</p><p><b></b>After a while of cuddling this way, which was surprisingly comfortable for both, Ranma voiced something that had been on her mind. "Kas-chan, I noticed that your speech patterns and behaviour were becoming more and more male when you were in cursed form. How come?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Unconsciously Kasumi stroked her chin before answering. "You know, I have asked Cologne about the nature of the Jusenkyo curses when she asked me to accompany her into the Nekohanten. What she told me is quite fascinating, from a scientific point of view. Apparently the transformational magic of the Springs uses the genetic make-up of the victim to bring it into the form it would have had had it been born this way. So you don't look like the poor girl who drowned in that spring 1500 years ago at all, Ranma-chan. I bet you're far prettier."</p><p><b></b>At this Ranma blushed. "You're quite easy on the eyes too, and that in both forms." she teased.</p><p><b></b>Now it was Kasumi turn to blush. "Ahem. Thank you. But on with the explanation." she said and assumed her teaching voice. "The being or person that has drowned in a spring originally only serves as a kind of marker which serves to define the basics like the gender in case of gender-changing curses like ours or the species in case of animal or more esoteric curses. The rest is provided by the DNA of the victim. Or so Cologne told me. That is why you look so much like your mother when you're in female form. Cologne also told me that the curse contains something like a brief manual on how to handle the cursed body. That's also why Mousse can fly as a duck or why Shampoo lands on her paws when falling down as a feline." Kasumi well avoided the c-word, for she knew Ranmas reaction to it.</p><p><b></b>They still had to find a way to remedy the most grievous error Genma Saotome had committed: the Neko-ken. Shaking herself out of her musings Kasumi continued to explain, while beginning to caress the body of her love. "You, while having a female body, react naturally to stimulus like a female would. Think about it. In this form, you have a girl's brain and girls hormones. But those only influence your behaviour, not your personality. And because your personality is essentially male, you still remain a guy inside. Though you will become and act more female the longer you stay in this form. It is due to your upbringing and all this harping about manliness that you never switched into female speech patterns and behaviour while in your other form like you'd normally have. You just have to let this whole manliness thing go, Ranma-chan. It does not apply to you any more anyway."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked unsure. "But what if...? What if..." she couldn't bring herself to word it.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi had a good guess where this was going. "What if you lose yourself, you mean?" she asked softly.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. Kasumi just deepened the embrace to show her that she had nothing to be afraid of. "That won't happen, Ranma-chan. The curse does not work this way. You just have to find a balance between your femininity and your masculinity. As have I. Everyone has Yin and Yang, and we have to find a balance between the two. I'm beginning to, that's why I speak and act more manly when I am a male. There is also another reason which I will show you once we have internet access. But this part of the curse slowly etches on, but it is nothing to fear or despise. Don't worry, you won't turn a girl in mind. Cologne has assured me that."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist looked visibly relieved. "That's a relief. What would I do without you, Kas-chan? And what have I done my whole life without you?"</p><p><b>'Been miserable and treated like garbage by everyone.'</b> she thought as she stroked the redheads' hair. "Now you have me, love. And I won't leave you."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi noticed how the smaller girl relaxed even more, and a few minutes later Ranma had gone to sleep. Smiling to herself Kasumi reached for her own sleeping bag and converted it into a blanket. Then she covered the two of them with the makeshift blanket and resumed the position she had had before. It did not take long until sleep claimed her too.</p><p><b></b>The next morning started out like the others beforehand, expect that it was a rainy day and that no snogging sessions occurred. The weather also meant Ranma for the day, and to be honest, what with being in the company of Kasumi she did not mind it that much any more. Slowly she understood that both of her forms were still Ranma Saotome, and that the girl Ranma was nothing separate from the person Ranma.</p><p><b></b>After a hearty breakfast the two repacked the tent and headed for the Shiga prefecture, or to be more specific, the city Ootsu, this was located at Lake Biwa. Kasumi had made a very interesting suggestion during breakfast, and as Ranma had noticed that Kasumi was missing her home as much as she, she had been delighted at the suggestion.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi had suggested informing at least Ranma's mother, and by proxy Nabiki about what had happened during their encounter with Kodachi. And who knew, maybe the Neriman's had news too. To this end Kasumi had suggested to invest the money into a high-end laptop, with which they could access the net.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo girl was no novice regarding the net, and it was actually something she had gotten interested in because of her younger sister. Who knew that having a mail-account and exchanging recipes could be so much fun? But it was, and Kasumi regarded the internet as something highly useful and always strived to learn more about it.</p><p><b></b>From some days ago and from past experiences Kasumi knew that Ranma had even greater knowledge of the net than she, and thus she had immediately agreed to buy a notebook. The money she had received from Nabiki would surely be more than suffice to buy a real high-end notebook, and luckily Ranma knew what they would be looking for.</p><p><b></b>According to their plan they wanted to buy their new notebook today, something Ranma was looking forward to very much. Sure, Nabiki had gotten increasingly friendlier to him after Jusendo and she had been allowed to use her comp more and more often, but still, the feeling remained that she was using a comp that did not belong to her.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had always disliked asking others for permission to use their stuff, and she had hated to be a freeloader while she had lived at the Tendos. That had also been the reason whys s/he had allowed Nabiki to take the shots of her female half. But now she'd get her very own notebook, and she was delighted at the prospect to get into contact with her mom. That was why they were now in search of a decent computer shop in Ootsu.</p><p><b></b>And finally they found a promising looking computer store in the middle of the inner city of Ootsu, and upon entering the shop Ranma whistled. Through Nabiki she had learned quite a lot regarding computers and internet in the last few months, and what this shop had available was great! They politely declined the offer of help from the shops assistant and started looking around.</p><p><b></b>And Finally Ranma decided upon a model. It was the latest model from a well known brand and very sophisticated looking, with 15,1 TFT and a fast 2.8 GHz processor, 1 GB of RAM, a 120 GB HDD, a very sophisticated graphics card, a double-layer DVD-burner and a very good main board. All in all everything Ranma had ever wished for.</p><p><b></b>Its storage battery allowed working with the laptop for over three hours without a power source, and that was top for that category, as the shops assistant told them. The man was quite surprised that such a cute redhead was so knowledgeable in the area of computers and inwardly hoped to ask her out, for she was a real knock-out! But when he saw how she looked at the beautiful woman that accompanied her, he shot the idea right out of the window. She was off the market, and that for good, as it seemed. Too bad that such a cute girl was playing for the wrong team…</p><p><b></b>Well, the notebook was naturally designed for the use of the internet, as it was equipped with a WLAN-card and other network access ports. And the price was so good that Ranma could do nothing but buy the thing. With gleaming eyes Ranma finally sealed the deal and bought the laptop for 300,000 Yen. And when she left the shop with her love in tow she had a big grin plastered on her face. This was shopping how she liked it!</p><p><b></b>Now they only had to find a WLAN-hotspot from which they could log in, and Ranma was looking forward to get into contact with her mother and even Cologne. And there was also the email-address of Ryoga. Yes, it would be a world of fun!</p><p><b></b>To be on the safe and comfortable side Ranma had also bought a notebook-bag in which she had stored the notebook after she had bought it. Now that nobody was looking she stored it within her personal stuff space. Right now the two were sitting on a park-bench, and this time they had made sure that this particular park was not infested by would-be-rapists.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi was leaning against her while Ranma typed on her notebook. One of the internet cafés had a W-LAN spot available, and after paying for it Ranma had begun to type away. She had been very happy as that gave her the opportunity to bring her mother up to date.</p><p><b></b>When she was finished with her message she looked it over once more, as she wanted to be sure that she had not forgotten anything. Wistfully she hid the contents from Kasumi, as she was not to read it as of yet.</p><p><b>To</b>: The Katanalady</p><p><b>From</b>: The wild child</p><p><b>Subject</b>: Hi mom!</p><p><b></b>Hey mom,</p><p><b></b>I know it has been nearly two weeks since we left, and we're sorry for not writing earlier, but we only thought of buying a notebook today. Now we wanted to give you an update on our situation. Well, the trouble began already when we wanted to leave Nerima. That loon Kodachi attacked first Kasumi because she thought her an obstacle to her 'perfect love' with me, and when I changed into a girl she wanted to kill me for 'hiding her Ranma-sama from her'. What a darn loon! She made me so mad that I had to knock her out, but good. Grrr, nobody hurts my Kasumi!</p><p><b></b>Ahem, after that Cologne led us to a plain, I think she called it the Mlao plain. Never heard of it before, but it was so cool to train there! Guess what? I actually learned the Bakusai Tenketsu! Yes, that cool technique with which you can make rock and other inorganic (had to ask Kas-chan for the word) stuff explode. Cool, huh? Oh, and Cologne taught me some really cool techniques, and actually I had to use one of them yesterday. And those freaks deserved it too! Perverts! But more to that later.</p><p><b></b>What I write to you now will probably make you happy, mom, but please, keep it under wraps; especially from the old men. When we were training with Cologne I learned a new technique, a variant of my Hiryu Shoten Ha. Well, I modified it somewhat, and when I tried the revisions out… to say that they're as deadly as they come is an understatement. I was a girl at the time, and quite emotionally charged.</p><p><b></b>'Cause I remembered how I had to kill Saffron, and mom, I never want to have to kill again! Kasumi, who was a boy at the time, noticed that something was wrong with me. And nice and caring as Kasumi is, he comforted me. But that is not all. From there it grew into more, and to make a long story short… we confessed our feelings. Mom, Kasumi loves me.</p><p><b></b>And one thing he told me impressed me the most: he said that it is not the form that is important, not whether I am a girl or a boy, but that it is the person inside that is important. And that he loves this person. Kasumi loves me, the whole me, and I think I love him, her, whatever too. No, I don't just think I love Kasumi, I know it. I love him/her more than anything else. But I can't say it to her/him as of yet, courtesy of stupid pops. :( Please don't tell Kasumi either. I want to be the one when the time is right.</p><p><b></b>Guess what? I actually started to shoot some of pops stupid teachings out of the window. That was so cool! You know how difficult it is for me to show emotions, and Kasumi talked me into doing so more often. He was so damn convincing, and when he said that I should imagine the reaction of stupid pops to me kissing her/him in public I nearly burst a gut!</p><p><b></b>Kasumi is the most wonderful person I have ever met and I want it to work out between us. More than anything else. I will do everything for it, that I swear. And if pops dares to intervene, may the heavens be merciful on him, for I will be not. Apropos pops, if he misbehaves just beat on him until he is unconscious. That's the most effective way to shut him up. :)</p><p><b></b>But now to a very important thing: mom, get Akane to a doctor or shrink as soon as possible! She has apparently been poisoned by Shampoo, with an anger-enhancing potion I have forgotten the name of. Akane has to take some medication to calm her down; those calming herbs Kasumi used are not effective enough. Cologne wanted to stop by and see to it herself once she returned to Nerima, and if she has not already, then please get Akane help.</p><p><b></b>And no, I will not go back to how it was. According to Cologne the poison only enhanced what was already there, so Akane was already angry at me and did not trust me, which comes as no surprise, as this has been her state of mind concerning me ever since I got to know her. And I can do very well without insults, malletings, mistrust and clobberings. I may have loved her once, but not any more. I have no idea what I feel for her, but all the love I held for her as one would love his future mate is dead.</p><p><b></b>I am happy now with Kasumi, and I will not allow anyone or anything to change this. For the first time since long I feel really happy, and you wouldn't believe how good it feels! If stupid pops has a problem with that, feel free to give him a free lesson in pain. And believe me, what lays in my training trip with pop gives you more than enough reason to be angry with him too. :(</p><p><b></b>Now to what happened three nights ago. First of all, we bought some more supplies for our trip, and thank you for the money you gave me. It really comes in handy. :) Afterwards we went into a park, and now don't get your panties in a knot mom, but we got ambushed.</p><p><b></b>Yes, ten ugly guys, the member of some gang, ambushed us in the park, in broad daylight! The leader wanted to rape me, as I was a girl at the time, and as one of his goons had a knife to Kasumi's throat the situation did look very bleak. Then the guy with the knife made the mistake to hurt my love, and I saw red. I freed Kasumi, and he fell back so that they could not take him as a hostage. Then I demolished the guys, but good.</p><p><b></b>Don't worry, I did not kill or paralyze anyone, but they won't be molesting any girls for a long time. I nearly broke every single bone of each pervert, and I used a new pressure point technique Cologne taught me. Now what does it, you ask? #grin# Well, it ensures that none of those bastards will be able to perform in the next half year. Not that any one of them will have occasion to, as they have all been taken into custody by the police.</p><p><b></b>Afterwards we sat together with the people who were formerly terrorised by the gang, and we enjoyed a nice picnic.</p><p><b></b>Gotta say bye now, mom. We just bought some snacks, and I'm hungry again. Well, I'm a growing girl, boy, whatever.</p><p><b></b>Your child,</p><p><b></b>Ranma. With many greetings from Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>P.S.: write back soon, we'd like to know what happened in Nerima. We will try and stop by at a w-lan hotspot at the end of each day to check our mails. Greetings to everyone!</p><p><b></b>Satisfied with the contents of the mail, Ranma sent it, logged of from the net and closed the notebook. Then she stored it in the notebook-bag which she then stored in her personal stuff space. Afterwards the two enjoyed the warming rays of the spring sun, and only one hour later Ranma used one of the public restrooms to change back into a guy. Then the two cursed individuals continued their travel.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group. I enjoy reading your comments, and the suggestions you all make will help to make this story even better.</p><p>If you find anything illogical that might have created a plot-hole or anything else that is wrong, let me know and I'll fix it.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
