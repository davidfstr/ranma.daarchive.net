No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 18: Introductions gone astray</b></p><p><b></b>Ranma, Kasumi, Tenchi and Katsuhito were still seated around the table in the Shinto Priests living quarters when suddenly a young girl entered the room. She had blue hair done in twin ponytails, pink eyes and reminded Ranma instantly of a young version of the former Kasumi before she had received the curse and had been 'freed'.</p><p><b></b>Which was not a bad thing in Sasami's case as the young girl was obviously very happy. In her hands she carried a trayful of cookies. "Oh hello!" she exclaimed and Ranma decided instantly that he liked the little girl; she just reminded him too much of a younger Kasumi. "Grandpa, I didn't know that we had guests. Now I have too few cookies. Anyway, hi, I am Sasami. Pleased to meet you!" she exclaimed and bowed politely with the tray of cookies still in her hands.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist smiled, got up and bowed back. "Hi Sasami, I am Ranma Saotome. Nice to meet you. And this," he pointed at Kasumi, "is my girlfriend Kasumi Tendo. We will be staying with you for some time."</p><p><b></b>Sasami smiled delightedly at the prospect. Guests were always welcome unless they were dead set to destroy the house, Tenchi or Ryoko or anyone else for this matter. Only that Tenchi and Ryoko seemed to be the targets more often than not. "That is nice! I'll go and bake some more cookies!" she exclaimed and set the plate with the cookies she had been carrying down on the table. A second later she had bounded out of the room.</p><p><b></b>"What a lovely little girl!" Kasumi exclaimed. The three males could only nod. Tenchi and Katsuhito knew that from experience, and Ranma had already decided upon that he liked her. Maybe if he had had a little sister she would have been like her.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito turned to Ranma. "So, Ranma, how long did you plan to stay? Know that you are welcome as long as you wish. We have more than enough room at the house as you well know."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled sheepishly. "Yeah I remember. I also remember all the times Tenchi 'n me played hide and seek when baka oyaji was not there to harp at me. But I digress. Well, actually there is something more to our stay."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi as well as Katsuhito raised a brow at this and Ranma began to explain. "You have seen our curses." he began, and both men nodded. "I have had mine a bit more than a year now but due to my stupid father and his constant harping about how all girls are weak, stupid and worthless I never had time or occasion to get used to my curse. Plus there was the matter of a stupid Seppuku contract my father had concocted and tricked me into signing that said we would commit Seppuku if I was not a 'man among men' after my return from the training trip."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi was shocked. This he had not expected. "WHAT? Seppuku?"</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed boy nodded. "Yeah, but I'll come to that later. Luckily my mother let go of her weird views of manliness some time ago and decided that I should live by the rule of being a gentle person." he said with a smile. "I'll explain this later, too. After Kasumi here got cursed to become a man when hit with cold water my mother Nodoka Saotome," Katsuhito smiled sadly for a brief moment at hearing the name, "we, Elder Cologne and us, decided that Kasumi and I had to go on a training trip to come to terms with our curses." he said and grabbed a glass of water to sooth his sore throat. All this talking made thirsty.</p><p><b></b>However before he could continue Kasumi had taken up the plot. "After some time of training with Elder Cologne in the Amazon Arts, Ranma and I travelled towards Okayama. We took stops at shrines and trained in Ranma's family art. At first we tried to stay in our birthforms as much as possible but we soon found out that it was impossible. Thus we began to teach each other how to behave, speak and act according to our gender. That was also when we noticed how deeply we love each other." she said with a slight blush. "Our plan is to stay in our cursed forms for at least three months and to this end we have received a special waterproof soap from Elder Cologne. Once it has been applied to the skin under usage of a cold shower it latches unto the curse and locks it. This lock will stay active for ten days and we won't be able to change back to our birthforms during that time."</p><p><b></b>"How do you change normally? And does it hurt?" Tenchi asked, clearly fascinated.</p><p><b></b>"Normally we change to our cursed, or alternate forms as we have labelled them, with cold water. One factor of the curse is that the cursed individual is turned into a water magnet. And that is meant literally. If there is any chance to get splashed you <i>will</i> get splashed. If there is none the curse creates such a situation and you'll get splashed anyway. The change back to our birthforms happens with the appliance of warm water." Kasumi explained. "And no it does not hurt. It is more like a whole-body-tingling."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi nodded, and then gulped as he realised something. "You two, be wary of Washu. She'd <i>love</i> to get either of you into her lab."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded sagely. "That is safe to assume."</p><p><b></b>Ranma raised a brow. That sounded like some insane scientist from one of the Gaijin movies. "Washu? Who is this?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi shuddered briefly. "Well, foremost Washu is the greatest scientific genius in the uni... ahem, world. And that is no joke or boasting. She is a genius scientist and has made some astounding inventions. But be very careful. If she sees someone of interest she'll try anything to drag him or her into her lab to study the person intently. And when I say intently I <i>mean</i> intently. It took me a week to be able to sleep nightmare-free after her last surprise check-up on me. She may look like a twelve year old but she really is the best scientist on this world. Best call her Washu-chan or little Washu. That she likes best and it also improves your chances to stop her from changing you into something you are not meant to be. But try your utmost to stay out of her lab!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi looked at each other. That did not sound good. "Anyway, we want to live three months in our alternate forms to get used to them. I admit that I already feel better about my female half what with that stupid Panda not around. If it would somehow be possible to change the trigger of the curse it would be wonderful." the cursed martial artist said.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi suppressed another shudder. "Then Lil' Washu is your best and probably only choice. If there is a way, she'll find it."</p><p><b></b>The two cursed individuals looked at each other again, and then nodded. "It is worth a shot." Ranma said for them both. "But first we'll live those three months in our other bodies. That is also how long we'd estimated to stay. In this time I want to learn how to be a woman while Kasumi wants to learn how to be a man. And with the help of the other we'll succeed." he finished and leaned sideward towards Kasumi and gave her a deep kiss.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled. One could see on first look that those two were obviously and truly in love. And the Shinto Priest was happy for Ranma. If any one deserved happiness then it was Ranma. That was also why he was not sure how to broach the topic he would have to talk about sooner or later.</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto Priest noticed with pride that Ranma was <i>very</i> powerful; s/he was indeed Nodoka's child. And even though these powers Ranma began to access did not seem to be Juraian in origin at first glimpse it was obvious that they <i>were</i> far above average even compared to the strongest human martial artist. Katsuhito had also encountered Happosai in his long life and for a human the diminutive man had been really strong; but even the founder of the Anything Goes style would not be able to compare to Ranma any more in his opinion.</p><p><b></b>No, he would have to tell Ranma the truth sooner or later; it would also lift a burden from his soul that had nothing to do with the promises he had made to Nodoka. Too bad that it would heap more onto the shoulders of this fine young individual than s/he was already carrying. But thus was Destiny.</p><p><b></b>Hmm, maybe he should wait until Ranma and his beautiful girlfriend had gotten used to their curses. Or was she more than a girlfriend? "Ranma, if you don't mind my interest but are you two engaged? I mean it is obvious how you feel about each other and as a Shinto Priest I can only say that I am glad for the two of you."</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi looked at each other. "If ya mean ta ask if we're engaged..." Ranma said and paused to smile lovingly at Kasumi while he drew her nearer to himself, "the answer is not <i>yet</i>."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi blushed pleasantly and leant a little closer into Ranma. "At the moment we're more like boyfriend and girlfriend, really. Dependent on the form of course." she added as an afterthought.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi looked at Ranma astonished. "What, you mean when you're a girl, Ranma, and she's a boy, you're his girlfriend?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed, but looked defiant. It was something he had to become used to and at first his primarily male self-image had made this very difficult. But after some time of being in girl-form while Kasumi had been a man he had accepted it. Up till now he suspected that it had something to do with those tongue-curling kisses he had received each time when he had changed into a she, among other things.</p><p><b></b>And why should it be any other way? They loved each other and they also had to play the role their changing genders demanded of them. Ranma had also learned that s/he could lean into Kasumi for support when he was a she just as much as Kasumi could in reverse. Before he would have never guessed but Kasumi possessed a quite strength that had surprised him verily. "Yes, that's how it is. Look at it this way. When we are in our birthforms I am Kasumi's boyfriend and she is my girlfriend. Naturally the same applies in reverse when we are in our alternate forms. Then I am Kasumi's girlfriend and he is my boyfriend. Simple, ne?"</p><p><b></b>Silence. Then, after a moment Tenchi nodded. "I... see. That's an interesting outlook on the situation but considering your curses probably the only one that keeps you sane."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded in compliance. "That is a very mature assessment of your situation, children. As you said, there are no cures thus it is the only viable option to get used to your curses. You can however benefit from the fact that you have opposite curses as you can learn a lot from the other. But now I have a question. You said that this soap will lock you for ten days per soap bar? And you will continuously lock yourself for at least three months?" Ranma and Kasumi nodded. "Good. That will make things easier."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi looked at his grandfather. "What do you mean, gramps?"</p><p><b></b>The Shinto Priest looked first at Tenchi and then at Ranma. "Ranma, despite your situation you really should not neglect your education." the old man said. "From what I know of your education up till now it has been questionable at best. But to have the best chances in life you need a good education. In fact the best you can get. Or do you want to be dependent on your father forever? I can't believe this." the old man said and a hint of steel showed in his voice.</p><p><b></b>Ranma cocked his head questioningly. "What do you mean?"</p><p><b></b>It was Kasumi who looked at him with sad eyes and gave him the answer. "Love, as much as it pains me to say so: from what I know about your father he only plans to use you as a ticket to his retirement. <i>That </i>is why he provided you with such a sloppy education and kept you ignorant of many things. He wants to <i>use</i> you and wanted to make you dependent on him. He only plans to get you to take over the dojo through marriage to live off of your hard work. Don't let him succeed, love. Rather you must learn as much as you can." she said and paused to take a breath. Her face changed into a smile. "Sure, I have helped you with this grade and you have improved tremendously but it will not be enough. You need a college degree to become a widely respected and renowned sensei. Even my father has a college degree, love. You must see this as a challenge. A challenge to beat your moronic father in his own game. Become as clever as possible, cleverer than he is."</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo daughter, like Nodoka, had soon found out how to motivate Ranma to do something that was also in the martial artists' interest. Present Ranma with a challenge. And from the gleam in his eyes she could tell that he <i>felt</i> challenged. "I can't believe the gall of that fat, lazy and moronic panda! So he planned this all along to keep me dumb so that he could use me 'n my wife to fill his fat stomach until he died, did he?" he said in a chilly voice. "I always suspected something like that but to hear it from <i>you</i>…"</p><p><b></b>The soul of ice was fully engaged as Ranma did not want to give in into his new powers. He did not know if he would not inadvertedly pulverise something. Instead he cooled the room as he started pacing. "I will do my best to never disappoint you, Ka-chan and I will do anything to give us the best possible future. If I have to learn like a lunatic includin' things that don't interest me to do it so be it!" he said with determination and sat down beside Kasumi again.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled at her love. What Ranma had said about learning for their future made her really proud of her Ranma. It seemed that he finally had understood just how much his father had really betrayed him and she wondered if the stupid panda would survive their first meeting after they got back to Nerima. She was also very happy that their relationship was growing in leaps and bounds. "Thank you, Ra-kun. I know you will." she said and moved to kiss her love.</p><p><b></b>Soon their lips met in a passionate kiss and only the clearing of a throat reminded them that they were not alone. Smiling sheepishly Ranma held the hug he shared with his love and simply enjoyed the pleasure their hug brought. Soon the hug gave way to another soft kiss and Tenchi and his grandfather smiled at each other. Nobody deserved happiness more than those two.</p><p><b></b>This smile however changed soon into an evil one as grandfather and grandson were both thinking about a fitting punishment for a certain panda. And once more a certain Genma Saotome, currently in panda-form and playing with a tire in the backyard of the Tendo compound, sneezed.</p><p><b></b>After Ranma and Kasumi had come up for air Katsuhito smiled at Ranma. "I'll contact Tenchi's school and have you registered there as a female."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked over at Kasumi who smiled gently at him and nodded. "Sure, as long as there ain't no totally loony principals throwing exploding pineapple bombs or giving all sorta horrible haircuts ta students. And I sure hope they ain't got no loony Kendo adepts who want to shower me with their affections while I am female." he replied with a nod, talking about these topics with the air of someone who talked about the weather.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito looked dumbfounded and Ranma felt it prudent to elaborate what was every day life at Furinkan High. After the brief summary the Shinto priest wondered how anyone should get a decent education at a place like Ranma had described. And he knew enough of Ranma to tell that the youth was not exaggerating. "Do you want to be registered under the same name as your male half?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned. "Actually, we have planned ahead regarding this. We've got us ID-cards for our cursed forms, fully official and legal. Turned out there's actually a bureau dealing with Jusenkyo curses. With the help of Nabiki, Kasumi's sister, we were able to get those IDs for our alternate forms. Once we are locked in our alternate forms I will be Ránmā Saotome and Kasumi will be Yoshiro Tendo."</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto Priest nodded once more. "Then I will register you under the name of Ránmā Saotome. You can drop out at any given time and transfer to your old school if you want to after those three months that you want to stay with us."</p><p><b></b>"Thanks." Ranma said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito returned the smile. "You're welcome. The next term starts in two months as far as I know. That should be more than enough time to get used to the curse beforehand. Unless... you could also go to Tenchi's school for the remainder of the term as a guest student. Only if you want to, of course."</p><p><b></b>Ranma scratched his head. "I'll think about it. First of all I hafta get used to my curse and all that. Then I'll see."</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto Priest nodded. "That's only fair."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist actually smiled. Finally no one wanted to pressure him into doing something, finally decisions were up to him. It was a good feeling.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi looked once more at his friend, a curious expression on his face. "Ranma, say, is Nerima really as bad as they show in the news?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist was puzzled for a moment. Then he remembered the boy from the ice cream parlour. "Umm, have there been <i>many</i> news reports from Nerima?"</p><p><b></b>"Only then when this strange flying monster that looked like a bull attacked the town or the time when you fought that other boy who could throw ki-blasts." Tenchi said.</p><p><b></b>"Oh." Ranma said in a tone that said 'Then everything is dandy'. "This 'strange flying monster' is another cursed victim. He was accidentally cursed when Happosai, the founder of my school, baptised him in a Spring after his birth. At least we believe it was an accident. It was the Niuhoomanmaorenniichuan - the Spring-of-Drowned-Yeti-riding-a-Bull-holding-a-Crane-and-Eel and one of the most cursed Springs there were. In essence Pantyhose Taro turns into a flying Minotaur with huge physical strength when splashed with cold water. That's the monster. As for the other boy that was Ryoga and we're friends now. Other than that, yes, life in Nerima has been as crazy as reported. Probably even more so."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded. He could certainly believe it. Maybe it was time to pay Nerima a visit to convince himself of it. But first things first. He would take over the training of Ranma and maybe even Kasumi. With their approval of course and after he had told Ranma of his promise to Nodoka. But this offer would be made once those two had settled down.</p><p><b></b>Now that the conversation was over Katsuhito served some tea and the four enjoyed the cookies Sasami had made. Due to Ranma's colossal appetite they soon were cookie crumbs, very small cookie crumbs at that. It was a good thing that Sasami returned a while later with another and much bigger tray of cookies.</p><p><b></b>"Thank you, Sasami." Katsuhito said. "They were delicious as always."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded empathically. "Delicious does not even begin to describe it." he exclaimed. "They were world-class! I'd say they can nearly compare with your cooking, Ka-chan." he teased Kasumi who had meanwhile thanked Sasami too.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smirked. She had the perfect counter. "Hmm, let's see in three months if <i>you</i> can compare to my cooking, love." she said cryptically.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist gulped. She didn't mean... did she? Bridal training? One look at Kasumi and he gulped again. Yup, she <i>did</i> mean business.</p><p><b></b>With a sigh Ranma attacked the cookies. Now only food could help while the others laughed at Ranma's expression.</p><p><b></b>Sasami smiled at the new guests. She really liked them, and they were such a cute couple. "Thank you! It makes me happy that you like my cookies!" she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito coughed to get Sasami's attention, and the little girl looked at the seated Shinto Priest. "Sasami, please tell Ayeka and Ryoko that we'll be having guests for a few months. I expect those two to be on their best behaviour."</p><p><b></b>Sasami nodded. "Will do!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Sasami had excused herself shortly afterwards and had said she had to make preparations for the evening meal. At the mention of food, as usual, a certain pigtailed martial artist picked up. "Food? Cool! When?" he asked eagerly.</p><p><b></b>Needless to say everyone laughed. "At six o'clock, Ranma. And I have told Sasami to make plenty for you."</p><p><b></b>At this comment of Katsuhito Ranma raised a brow, while thinking <b>'Drat, two more hours!' </b>"Huh? Why do ya mean?"</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto Priest smiled. "Ranma, I know how large your power-reserves are and I can feel them deepening further even now. Therefore it is only logical that you need a lot of food."</p><p><b></b>Ranma was intrigued. "You mean you can read auras and ki-levels too?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded. "Yes, Ranma. That is one of my abilities. But now I'd suggest that we go over to the house and introduce you to the rest."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist was surprised. "Rest? Are there more than you two, Tenchi's father and Sasami and this Washu? Oh, this Ayeka and Ryoko you mentioned?"</p><p><b></b>It was Tenchi who answered. "Yes, Ranma. There are more. Among them Ryoko and Ayeka. And those two are my fiancées. You see, I can very well relate to what you went through in Nerima. I am in a comparable situation. But you'll soon see for yourself."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. Now he was really curious to get to know the ladies who were fighting over the heart and other parts of Tenchi. He only hoped that they were not like <i>his</i> past suitors and only fought over him like over a possession or a prize to be won. But he'd soon see.</p><p><b></b>Together the four left the Shrine and stepped outside, and just at this moment another downpour occurred which changed Ranma and Kasumi into their alternate forms. The downpour did not last more than 30 seconds but was strong enough to soak them through. As was customary Kasumi-otoko gave Ranma a tongue-curling kiss which left the redhead somewhat dazed.</p><p><b></b>"I see what you meant when you said that cold water tends to find you. The weather forecast didn't say anything about rain and ever since you two arrived it has rained two times already." Katsuhito said, shaking his head.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded while Tenchi made a supreme effort to look away from his friends' chest. Man, those things were even bigger than Ryoko's! "That is the part of the curse that annoys me the most. Not my other body, for I've begun to accept it, but the constant splashing. If I'd got 1,000 Yen for each time I've been splashed since I got the curse I'd be a billionaire by now."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. "At first I did not want to believe the water magnet part of the curse but after being cursed for more than two weeks I can confirm that it is the truth. That was also why we decided to stay in our alternate forms for three months. The splashing <i>is</i> annoying and it would be impossible to get fully used to our other bodies if we changed forms constantly. It would be nice if your scientist could do something about it."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito stroked his chin. "As far as I have understood you'll soon lock your curses using this special soap, right?" Ranma and Kasumi-otoko nodded. "Am I further right to assume that the splashing will cease then as the curse has no reason to splash you any more?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked unsure. "Even Cologne was not sure regarding this point. But we <i>think</i> so."</p><p><b></b>The Shinto Priest nodded once more. "Then those will probably be some stress-free three months for you. I can only guess how irritating it must be to change genders at the drop of some water and being freed of this even for a short amount of time might be just what you need to get used to your alternate forms. See it as a sort of vacation."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko and Ranma nodded in understanding. "Yes, that sounds about right." they said in unison and both had to smile that they had said the same thing.</p><p><b></b>"Okay, let's introduce you to the gang." Tenchi said and the rest nodded.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito, Tenchi, Ranma and Kasumi had just begun walking over to the house when suddenly a device at Tenchi's right wrist began to vibrate. Tsunami. "Excuse us," Tenchi said, "we gotta do something first and will follow soon after. You can't miss the house and I'm sure Sasami has already told the others that you're coming."</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko nodded as Tenchi and Katsuhito disappeared though both wondered what this strange device at Tenchi's wrist was good for. Looking at each other and shrugging they took each others hand and began the descent towards the lake.</p><p><b>-.-</b></p><p><b></b>It took several minutes to descend all 1000 steps as Ranma rather enjoyed holding hands with Kasumi-otoko than running down the path as fast as she could have. When they had arrived at the path again both looked around and enjoyed the peace and serenity of the place once more. There was no comparison to the always loud and busy town Nerima and none of them could remember ever having felt so much peace and quiet before.</p><p><b></b>The two cursed individuals made their way down the path that led to the house, holding hands, when the serenity that seemed to permeate the air was suddenly disrupted by a large explosion and adjacent yelling. "RYOKO YOU DAMN MONSTER WOMAN! COME BACK HERE SO I CAN SMITE YOU!" yelled an obviously very enraged woman who looked slightly charred.</p><p><b></b>She had purple hair that was even purpler than that of Shampoo, and her kimono was hanging in tatters. She was apparently chasing a mischievous looking cyan-haired woman. What really surprised both cursed individuals was that she was floating effortlessly through the air. And she was smirking. "COME AND MAKE ME YOUR ROYAL DUMBNESS!" she yelled back with a huge grin on her face.</p><p><b></b>Ranma swallowed her surprise and surveyed the strange woman. Aside from a very impressive power-level she had <i>very</i> spiky cyan hair. She was wearing stone-washed jeans and a tank top and as far as Ranma could see her bust line was nearly as impressive as hers. But only nearly she thought with some pride.</p><p><b></b>The strange flying girl nearly collided with Ranma until the spiky-haired female had the foresight to look ahead. Then she stopped dead in her tracks and looked Ranma dead in the eyes. A frown appeared on her face as she surveyed the newcomers, or to be more accurate, her. She remained standing in the air and crossed her arms. "Who are you and what are you doing here? Are you here for my Tenchi?" she asked threateningly, ignoring Kasumi-otoko completely.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's jaw nearly impacted on the ground. "W... what?"</p><p><b></b>The woman growled. "Are ya too dumb, ya air-headed bimbo? I asked ya if yer here for <i>my</i> Tenchi!"</p><p><b></b>"<i>Your</i> Tenchi?" asked a voice from behind. The slightly charred looking purple-haired woman had finally caught up. "Now that's a laugh. Tenchi is <i>mine</i>!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma's eyes had meanwhile grown to the size of dinner plates and a large sweatdrop had formed at the back of her head. Then it made click and Ranma knew why it all sounded so familiar. She smiled in spite of the situation, a situation easily comparable to the many incidents she had lived through in Nerima. "No, I am not here to steal 'your' Tenchi, Miss. I am Ranma Saotome and this is Kasumi Tendo, my 'boyfriend'." she said and the other girls did not notice the pronunciation Ranma gave the word boyfriend.</p><p><b></b>The purple-haired woman looked at the cyan-haired woman. "See, you paranoid monster woman? Not every girl that comes here wants my Tenchi. Now show some manners." she chided the other woman before she turned to smile at Ranma and Kasumi-otoko. "Hello, I am Ayeka; and this monster woman here goes by the name of Ryoko."</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko bowed politely. "Nice to meet you." they said in stereo.</p><p><b></b>The cyan-haired woman named Ryoko however was not satisfied and eyed the two newcomers suspiciously. "One sec..." she said and a nasty grin appeared on her face, "Sasami told us that we <i>would</i> have guests. But she told us that Ranma Saotome was a man and Kasumi Tendo a woman. Nice ploy! Hadn't ya made the mistake ta introduce your boyfriend as Kasumi Tendo ya might have succeeded with whatever ya had planned. Now, who are ya <i>really</i>?" she asked, energy sparking between her fingers.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo sighed. Of course, Sasami had not seen a demonstration of the curse. He nodded to himself and answered before Ranma's temper could rise. He had noticed the tell-tale signs. This Ryoko was rubbing her the wrong way. The <i>completely</i> wrong way. "If we could go into the house we could prove that we are who we said we are. It's a bit complicated but I assure you that we mean no harm. Tenchi and his grandfather Katsuhito know that we are here; in fact they sent us down here and will follow shortly. A device at Tenchi's arm went off and they said they had something to do first. That's why we're here without them."</p><p><b></b>Suddenly a sound came from behind Ayeka and Ryoko. For Ranma it was the most dreaded sound in the whole world. "Miya miya! Miya!"</p><p><b></b>"C... c... CAT!" Ranma exclaimed and hid behind Kasumi-otoko in a flash, hugging him from behind and clinging to him like to a life buoy.</p><p><b></b>The woman-turned-man sighed and watched as a very cute creature emerged from behind the two women. It looked somewhat like Stitch from the Gaijin movie 'Lilo and Stitch', except for the coloration of the fur. Apparently it seemed to be some strange cross between a rabbit and a cat. A very cute cross at that. But much to Ranmas chagrin it shared one of the characteristic of a cat for it meowed just like one.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka and Ryoko looked at each other and were for once united in an emotion. Confusion. Then that what the cabbit had said registered within Ryoko's mind and she looked at the cabbit. "What do ya mean he's saying the truth?"</p><p><b></b>"Miya. Miya miya!" the little cabbit exclaimed and sent Ranma into another bout of fright. Kasumi-otoko let himself be hugged from behind and stroked her arms softly to calm her down.</p><p><b></b>The first crown princess of the planet Jurai looked at her rival. She had already decided that their visitors had told the truth. How else should they have known about the communication device? "When Ryo-Ohki says that he said the truth then it is so. You never doubted her before. Why now?"</p><p><b></b>Ryoko's eyes gleamed. "Because <i>she</i>," she pointed at Ranma who was still hiding behind Kasumi-otoko, "is here to seduce <i>my</i> Lord Tenchi! I <i>know</i> it!"</p><p><b></b>Ayeka could only shake her head at Ryoko's antics. "Come you two, just ignore her. I usually do too unless she acts too undignified." <b>'Which is sadly all the time.'</b> she added as an afterthought.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko and Ranma looked at each and nodded then while Ryoko silently steamed. Shrugging the cursed individuals made their way towards the house while Ryoko followed them floating. "I'll watch you, so one wrong move and you're toast!" she threatened.</p><p><b></b>That rose Ranmas temper more effectively than even her father's harpings. Fire seemed to blaze in her eyes. "Nobody threatens my Kasumi!"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko sensed the danger of an imminent explosion and laid a calming hand on Ranmas shoulders. "Hey love, it is okay. That won't be necessary. For once we are in the house we can prove that we are who we said we are. There's really no need for violence, love." he said and pulled her into a comforting hug.</p><p><b></b>Slowly the anger seemed to evaporate and Ranma leant into the hug, enjoying the comforting and calming sensations of being held by her taller boyfriend.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka looked at Ryoko. "Do you <i>still</i> think that she is here to steal Tenchi? Looks to me like she's already taken."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko growled. "<i>Every</i> girl that comes here wants to steal my Tenchi, including <i>you</i>!" she said to Ayeka.</p><p><b></b>Now that Ranma had simmered down the four people and one cabbit proceeded to the house without further incident aside from the glares that were traded back and forth between Ranma and Ryoko.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Upon entering the house Ranmas mood improved once more in a flash. "Mmmh, I smell something heavenly." she commented.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko had noticed the aroma in the air likewise and nodded. Obviously Sasami was preparing another round of cookies prior to the lunch just like she had said she would. And it smelled heavenly indeed. "That's my love, always thinking with her stomach." he teased.</p><p><b></b>"I thought I had heard new voices." came Sasami's voice from the kitchen as she emerged from this direction. "Hello, I am Sasami." she said smiling.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko shared a grin. "We have already met, Sasami. A few minutes ago in the shrine with Katsuhito and Tenchi. We are Ranma and Kasumi. Sorry 'bout this."</p><p><b></b>The little girl boggled. "But that can't be! Ranma is a boy and Kasumi is a girl!" she exclaimed with certainty.</p><p><b></b>The cursed individuals shared a chagrined smile. Meanwhile the other residents of the house had arrived too at hearing new voices in the house.</p><p><b></b>Even Washu had emerged from her lab as her sensors had told her of the new arrivals. "And who are you?" she asked. Washu was in her 'little Washu' form like nearly always and looked considerably cute.</p><p><b></b>"Yeah, I'd like to know too! Hi, I'm Mihoshi!" she said with a beaming smile. Ryoko shook her head. The airhead was always so trusting. And that as an officer of the Galaxy Police. <i>Some</i> people...</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko looked at Sasami. "If you had two a bit larger cups of water for us, one warm, nearly hot, and one cold we could show you."</p><p><b></b>Sasami nodded. That was a simple request. And while the little girl went to the kitchen to fetch the required items Tenchi and Katsuhito came just in.</p><p><b></b>"Tenchi!" Ryoko exclaimed, "These two claim that they're Ranma Saotome and Kasumi Tendo although both have the wrong gender! I bet the redheaded harridan is here to steal you away from me!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma had started to simmer again and Kasumi-otoko put a restraining hand on her shoulder and pulled her close. Not that he would have stood a chance in hell to stop her should she decide to attack the offending woman. Even Kasumi-otoko thought that Ryoko was overdoing it with her paranoia.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi and Katsuhito just looked at each other and nodded. They would let Ryoko ride it out and sit back. From time to time she needed to be taken down a peg or two and it seemed as if Ranma was more than capable of doing just that. "Is that so?" Katsuhito asked and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p><b></b>Just at this moment Sasami returned from the kitchen, bringing the two cups of water into the living room. Ayeka was curious now, as were Sasami, Washu and Mihoshi. Even Ryoko seemed to forget her ire for the moment. Sasami placed the cups on the table. "And now?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled. She would take over this part. After all, she was <i>used</i> to these demonstrations. "Watch. And watch closely. Ka-kun, if you would?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. And upended the cup of warm water over Ranma's head. All present watched fascinated as Ranma transformed into Ranma-otoko, even Tenchi and Katsuhito who had seen the transformational process once before.</p><p><b></b>"What the blazes!" that was Washu.</p><p><b></b>"Huh?" Mihoshi.</p><p><b></b>"W... what, where did the redhead go? Don't tell me that you..." Ayeka stuttered as her brain struggled to deal with this strange visual evidence that seemed to defy reality.</p><p><b></b>"Whoa! You really <i>are</i> Ranma! Cool!" Sasami gasped in amazement and instant acceptance.</p><p><b></b>"Miya miya?" Ryo-Ohki meowed inquisitively. Why was the beautiful girl suddenly a handsome boy? She did not understand. Had one of her carrots been bad?</p><p><b></b>Ranma's reaction to the meowing was predictable. "Ahhhhh! It did it again! The rabbit meowed!" he exclaimed and hid behind Kasumi-otoko. "Rabbits ain't gotta meow!" he accused.</p><p><b></b>Ryo-Ohki was looking around confused. Why was she... err, he not liking her? Had she done anything wrong?</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito who had seen Ranma's reactions to the cute cabbit seethed inwardly while giving no outward sign of his anger. What Genma Saotome had done was inexcusable and he would be punished once he had the chance to talk to Nodoka.</p><p><b></b>His grandson on his part had no idea of his thoughts and was smiling at his childhood-friend. "Ranma, she's no rabbit but a Cabbit. Ranma Saotome, meet Ryo-Ohki." he said to Ranma who was peering cautiously at the cabbit from behind Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>"It's not a c... c... one of 'em things?" Ranma asked him as Ryo-Ohki peered at him shyly.</p><p><b></b>"No. She's not. She's a really cute but sometimes naughty cabbit!" Sasami said and stroked Ryo-Ohki behind the ears. The purring that ensued did however nothing to calm Ranma's nerves. It still sounded too much like a cat for his taste.</p><p><b></b>"Excuse me but if my eyes and scanners aren't playing me, and I'm sure they're not as I'm the great Washu, then you were a <i>girl</i> some moments ago. And now you are obviously a boy. Which requires a complete gender change which according to my scanners is exactly what happened. Right down to the genetic level. How is this possible?" asked a very interested Washu.</p><p><b></b>At the gleam that had appeared in her eyes Ranma shrunk back. All his instincts told him to run, and they were <i>never</i> wrong. But using all of his control he fought down the impulse and answered. At least he tried to do so. "Umm... heh heh... you see..." he began with a sheepish grin.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko, always the sensitive one (not!), laughed. For some reason she did not like this redhead-turned-raven-haired boy and she'd let him/her know. "Hah hah, I can tell ya why. He's some kinda gender-bended weirdo! A freak!" she teased from her position besides Tenchi.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's temper flared once more. To call him a freak! The outrage! Forgotten was any attempt to explain the curse. "I ain't a gender-bended weirdo and I ain't a freak, ya idiot! I ain't nothin' of that!"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito sighed. The ex-space pirate was pushing the totally wrong buttons with astounding efficiency. If she continued this she'd probably get the walloping of her life if Ranma was as good as he suspected. And this time Ryoko would deserve it too.</p><p><b></b>And continue Ryoko did. With a smirk to boot. "What is it then, femboy? <i>Magic</i>?" she asked teasing.</p><p><b></b>"As a matter of fact..." Kasumi who had changed back to female form nearly unnoticed began, but was interrupted by her angry boyfriend.</p><p><b></b>For now Ranma had <i>really</i> started to boil over. If one insult still got him boiling despite all the progress s/he had made then that one Pantyhose Taro had always used. "What is your freakin' problem with me? I didn't do nothin' ta ya and ya insult me!"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito decided to intervene before this got too much out of hand. "He is right, Ryoko. You should apologise. As they will be staying with us for at least three months we can't afford to have bad blood here."</p><p><b></b>"WHAT?" Ryoko exclaimed, "Why should that freakin' femboy stay with us? We've got enough weirdoes here already!" she exclaimed and looked at Mihoshi who didn't get the hint.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko just shrugged inwardly; the blonde was just too ditzy. But it really would not do to have more competition for her Tenchi. The redhead-turned-raven-haired-boy could pretend all s/he wanted; regarding her Tenchi it was guilty until proven otherwise. It could all just be a show the two newcomers put up! Who told her that the redheaded form was not her true form? And besides she really did not like the feeling of suppressed power she was getting from this Ranma… it strongly reminded her of someone… someone she knew she hated.</p><p><b></b>"Ryoko!" Tenchi exclaimed, getting angry at seeing his childhood friend insulted, "Stop insulting my friend!"</p><p><b></b>"Phew. I ain't done nothing. It's the fault of that gender-bended freak." Ryoko stated with crossed arms.</p><p><b></b>Now Ranma was seeing <i>really</i> red. And he could do nothing to prevent his power-level from rising. "Now I've had it! I don't know what yer damned freakin' problem is but enough is enough! I ain't takin' no shit from ya, ya weirdo!" Ranma growled deeply as he switched into a fighting stance.</p><p><b></b>"What did ya call me, ya freakin' femboy?" Ryoko asked angrily, energy sparking between her fingers. Inwardly she grinned. Maybe this poor copy of a starlight would give her the excuse for a real fight. Lately her fists were really itching now that she was getting along better with Ayeka. That bout from some minutes ago had just been her customary attempt at mischief but now she had a real fight within her grasp. Now to push the femboy a bit further… "Wanna really get yer food outta the feeder fer the next months, huh? I'm happy ta help ya with that, femboy." she said with a smirk and cracked her knuckles.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's teeth grinded audibly and his battle-aura started to become visible as the air became charged with power. "Ya asked for it, monster woman! I'm gonna pound ya flat!" he growled.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi sighed. Ranma was <i>really</i> angry and she could not even scold him for it. This girl was really pushing all the wrong buttons and even his training was not enough to defuse the situation. It seemed as if a fight was inevitable.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko smirked and pointed at her cheek. "Then give me yer best shot ya femboy! <i>Prove</i> ta me that ya hit like the weak sissy ya are!" she taunted, confident that this puny human had nothing on her. Heck, even the <i>strongest</i> human could not even <i>scratch </i>her! Or so she thought.</p><p><b>'Miya miya miya miya miya!'</b> Ryo-Ohki suddenly exclaimed over their telepathic link. She had scanned the simmering Ranma and what she had found out was deeply disturbing. He had a much higher power-level than should be possible for a human and if she had interpreted her scan correctly…</p><p><b></b>The ex-space pirates head whipped over to Ryo-Ohki once <i>she</i>, Ryoko, had interpreted the data. <b>'What do ya mean he could be as strong as Yosho? And what's that nonsense about two power-sources? Rubbish! Ate too many carrots again, eh? Maybe I should put ya on a diet.'</b> Ryoko thought back.</p><p><b>'Miya! Miya miya!'</b> the cabbit insisted. Why wouldn't her mistress believe her? If she fought this girl... err, boy, she would get into trouble. And Ryo-Ohki did not want this.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko shook her head at her cabbit. "You must have eaten a <i>really</i> bad carrot. No <i>human</i> is that strong!" she said out loud.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked. He had not caught what had been going on but he knew what that comment meant. "Wanna find out, monster woman?" he asked, once more adapting the insult Ayeka had used.</p><p><b></b>Said Juraian Princess rubbed her hands in anticipation. If what she suspected was correct then Ryoko had just made her own life more difficult. She had caught the signs between Ryoko and her Ryo-Ohki. The cabbit was worried and had apparently warned Ryoko about something she had found out about Ranma. Yet Ryoko obviously refused to believe her cabbit.</p><p><b></b>But Ayeka had no reason to doubt Ryo-Ohki. The little cabbit had seldom been wrong and from what she understood she had apparently tried to warn and protect Ryoko. Too bad that she could not listen in into their telepathic conversations. But anyway she'd soon find out what that had been about.</p><p><b></b>"Ya got yerself a fight, femboy! And doncha expect me to hold back for ya!" Ryoko spat.</p><p><b></b>"Doncha expect me to either, monster woman!" Ranma shot back.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito didn't like the direction this was taking and was fearing for the structural integrity of the house should they decide to play up here in the house. A fight was apparently inevitable but damage control had to be engaged. "Remember the rules, Ryoko, no fighting in the house!" he insisted. "Last time it happened was bad enough!"</p><p><b></b>Ryoko looked somewhat sheepish and Ranma nodded. <i>He</i> had no problem with this for this was more of an advantage for him. With more space he could unfold his attacks much more efficiently. Heh, a Hiryu Shoten Ha in the basement would probably not be well received now, would it?</p><p><b></b>And considering the <i>new</i> attacks he had invented it would be much better if they took it to the outside. This Ryoko looked to be quite tough and she'd be an excellent guinea pig for his newest attacks. Inwardly he swore that he'd give that monster woman the dressing down of her life. What the heck was her problem? As if he'd ever try to seduce his best childhood-friend. Hah! If his girl-side was interested in any guy than in Kasumi!</p><p><b></b>Silently he thanked said Tendo sibling for his modified understanding regarding hitting girls. He still would not land the first blow or retaliate needlessly but he <i>would</i> defend himself and end the fight. And this Ryoko witch would be the first to get involved with this new and improved Ranma Saotome. "Of course, Master Katsuhito." he said and bowed. "Lets take this outside, monster woman."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko smirked evilly. "I'm gonna crush ya like the cockroach ya are."</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned in answer. "Then bring out yer finest hammer for I stand on firm ground!" he answered with blazing eyes.</p><p><b></b>"Oh my!" she exclaimed, "I have seldom seen him so angry. I hope he does not hurt her too badly!"</p><p><b></b>Sasami, always the peaceful one, interjected "Grandpa, we should not let them fight! Ranma could get hurt!"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito was about to answer that she should worry about Ryoko, but Ayeka laid a hand on her little sisters' shoulders. "Sis, I think you should better worry for <i>Ryoko</i> this time. For <i>I</i> will surely not." she exclaimed happily.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito and Tenchi were both looking forward to this fight. Maybe they would get a display of the real power Ranma Saotome possessed.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group. I enjoy reading your comments, and the suggestions you all make will help to make this story even better.</p><p>If you find anything illogical that might have created a plot-hole or anything else that is wrong, let me know and I'll fix it.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
