No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 28: Taro tries again</b></p><p><b></b>The newcomer turned out to be none other than Pantyhose Taro. The cursed Chinese youth was trying yet again to force Happosai to change his name. With a taunting smirk he surveyed Ranma. "Ahh, femboy. Back to being your true self, I see. Seeing as you let your hair down and everything." he teased.</p><p><b></b>Ranma suppressed the urge to return a verbal jibe, giving Taro just a disapproving glare. "What do you want, Taro?"</p><p><b></b>If Taro was irritated that Ranma had not reacted to his verbal jibe he did not show it. "The usual. I want my name changed. So where is the sick old man? I lost track of the old idiot some blocks ago."</p><p><b></b>Said sick old man was just peeling himself out of the wall once more. "Taro my boy! If you teach Ranma-chan here a lesson I <i>will</i> change your name!" he exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>"WHAT!" not only Taro exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>"Yes, yes," the old master exclaimed, "she needs to learn to respect her master. If you beat her I will change your name. This is a test of your worthiness, so don't disappoint me."</p><p><b></b>Taros' eyes gleamed while Ranma seethed. It was just like the old lech to play foul when he was beaten. "Can't fight your own battles, old lech? And you call yourself a grandmaster!"</p><p><b></b>Happosai just shrugged. "In love and war all is fair and square, Ranma-chan. There is nothing dishonourable when a pillar of the community asks a younger fighter to represent him. Rather that is an honour for this younger fighter! So Pa…, ahem, Taro, my boy, show her what you're capable off!" the tiny old man exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma snorted while Taro grinned. "Phew, pillar of the community… my ass!" the redhead exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko or their parts wondered if life in Nerima was usually this crazy or if they'd just arrived on a bad day. Actually they'd only wanted to pick up Ranma's mother and Mr. Tendo but what was happening here really defied reality. Not even <i>their</i> lives were that crazy! It was absolutely no wonder that Ranma had been more than happy to get at least somewhat of a break even if it had not been her own idea.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Taro on his part was ecstatic. Finally he had the chance to get a new name within his grasp and all that he'd have to do was to beat the snot out of the annoying femboy! That was practically like hitting two birds with one stone! There was no love lost between him and femboy and he'd love to teach him, her, whatever a lesson. "Okay, old lech. I will do it. But go back on your word and I'll nail your hide to the wall!" he exclaimed and jumped into the koi-pond before anyone could stop him.</p><p><b></b>What rose from the koi-pond moments later startled Tenchi, Ryoko and Ayeka quite a lot. Granted, they had seen the news-reports on the huge flying monster but to see it up close and to learn that it was in reality a young man with a curse was something else.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko wanted to give in to her impulse to go at it with her energy sword but Ranma shook her head making clear that this was her fight. Acknowledging this with a nod Ryoko limited herself to watch; as did Tenchi and Ayeka who had watched the exchange.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka on her part was angry at Happosai that he siced someone like that on her daughter when she had defeated him in an honourable way. Her daughter had been right indeed; this was not how a pillar of the community behaved but actually the perverted master of her husband had never been that. It seemed as if her Genma was not the only one who was in dire need of reeducation here. But first things first; now she'd watch how her daughter would fare against something that could be considering a monster from the legends, praying that she would emerge on top.</p><p><b></b>Pantyhose Taro on his part did not waste much time and attacked Ranma immediately. His tentacles lurched forward in an attempt to entrap Ranma but the Saotome girl had become way too fast for that to work and evaded them with ease. The massive beast growled and tried to punch Ranma but again she evaded the attack and the giant fist only hit the ground, spraying the observers with dirt.</p><p><b></b>Ranma realised fast that she'd need more space to knock Taro out and she knew that she had no other choice <i>but</i> to knock him out. Talking him out of it was impossible now that he was convinced that Happosai would change his name in case he did what the old lech wanted. How could anyone be so stupid as to believe the old pervert?</p><p><b></b>But then again, Taro was just too obsessed with his quest to have Happosai change his name and it seemed as if he was willing to do just about everything for it. Apparently he'd also forgotten that Happosai was hardly known to ever keep his word. And honestly she could not really fault Taro; his name <i>was</i> more of a curse for him than his Jusenkyo curse and once she had downed him she'd help him to force Happosai to do what he had promised. Even if Happosai's' promise would be invalid with Taro defeated.</p><p><b></b>But she <i>had</i> to defeat Taro first and she needed space for it. Leaping onto the wall and from there onto the roof of the Tendo home she hopped over the rooftops, a growling Taro hot on her heels. Ranma's destination was the empty lot near Furinkan high; a place were a lot of her battles had taken place and at the same time a place that offered the space she'd need. There she could go all out without the danger of Taro inadvertedly injuring or killing anyone, especially her mother.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka was much like her in many regards. Like her she was fearless and never backed down from just about anything; she would not have put it past her to attack Taro with her katana but as she had no idea if her mom would be a match for the monstrous cursed form of Taro she'd bring him down herself. She'd never forgive herself if her mother got harmed.</p><p><b></b>With half of her advertence she noticed that some of the others were following her too; but if she sensed it right only Ryoko was following her which was somewhat odd. Sure, she was the only one capable of flight out of the group but wouldn't Tenchi and Ayeka be able to follow too? Odd.</p><p><b></b>But at the moment she had no time to think about it as she had to evade the lunges Taro made for her; it was easy but at the same time she tried to keep the property damage down as much as possible. The people of Nerima might be used to their fighting but that did not mean that they had a card blanche for destroying things.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Finally she arrived at the empty lot with the flying cursed form of Taro still hot on her heels. As she dodged yet another attempt to entrap her in his tentacles she noticed that Ryoko had arrived at the scene too. But the cyan-haired alien just winked briefly at her, gave her the thumbs-up and teleported out of the area; much to Ranma's surprise. Not that she would have needed the support of Ranma in this fight but some encouraging watchers would have been nice.</p><p><b></b>Be it as it is Ranma had just decided to reveal her true powers when she suddenly registered newcomers. It were however none of her family or friends; not in the pokier sense anyway. The newcomers were none other than three certain Amazons. Elder Cologne must have sensed their power-levels and once she had steered for this lot the Elder must have known that something was up.</p><p><b></b>Not letting herself be distracted by that she evaded a strong kick by the monster and executed a somersault. But what happened next served to distract her and it cost her; for suddenly Ryoko teleported back in and she had someone in two. With her were Nabiki, her mother, Soun and her father. Then Ryoko teleported out once more.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had been momentarily distracted by that and Taro managed to blind her with his ink-attack. Thusly he managed to land a strong blow that sent her flying. The redhead landed in an undignified heap several hundred yards away. She could just feel the disapproving shake of the head of a certain Elder and she chided herself way harder for having let her guard down once more today.</p><p><b></b>With a snarl she got to her feet, wiped away the ink and some blood and powered up. The time of holding back was over and it was time to show Taro what he was truly up against; against the old lech she had held back but she knew with certainty that Taro's cursed form could take a lot of punishment. Besides she had been feeling irked all day for some reason and he was now the perfect scapegoat. Now she was about to deal out a lot of punishment and when she was finished powering up she just disappeared.</p><p><b></b>Taro looked around wildly, unsure of what had happened. Ever since when had femboy gotten so fast and powerful? Regardless, he was still the stronger fighter were the thoughts of Pantyhose Taro. However, when a certain redhead suddenly appeared in his face and well within his defences and landed and earth-shattering punch to said face that caused him to stagger back he began to ask himself if it had been a good idea to piss her off. Maybe it was this time of the month for femboy?</p><p><b></b>With a speed that belittled his mass Taro straightened himself again and used his ability of flight to cover the distance that was separating them. Ranma felt that Ryoko had reappeared with Ayeka and Tenchi and she also noticed that the old lech had followed them too.</p><p><b></b>This time she did not let herself get distracted by it and concentrated fully on the fight. As much as she could understand Taro it was high time that he understood that <i>she</i> was not responsible for his problems. The usual blame Ranma Saotome thing was getting old rapidly and she would not put up with it any longer. The times were she had allowed others to walk over her were over. Ultimately.</p><p><b></b>Countering a punch-kick-tentacle-attack-combo by just phasing out of sight she nearly instantly reappeared behind Taro and her kick to the back of the head sent the cursed young man actually flying despite his mass.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>At the side-lines a certain Yaazuniichuan cursed Amazon whistled. He had had corrective surgery on his eyes recently which had restored ninety percent of his eyesight and thus he saw the fight clearly. "Wow, since when is Saotome so strong?" he asked more to himself.</p><p><b></b>A certain Amazon Elder bopped him on the head with her staff out of general principles. "Had you had your glasses where they belonged at the right time, Mousse, you would have noticed it a long time ago. It was no unthinking act to release her from the outsider rules; she could have brought the whole tribe down easily with the power she possesses should we have dragged her to China. Do you see that now, younglings?"</p><p><b></b>Both Mousse and Shampoo nodded. To try to force someone with that kind of power to do as you wished was as ridiculous as asking the wind not to blow. It really seemed that their Elder had been wise in her actions. <b>'Damn, considering what for a kind of power I battled when I fought Saotome in my quest for Shampoo's love it is a miracle that I'm still alive! She could have toasted me easily!'</b> he thought.</p><p><b></b>That Ranma had not done just that proved to him that he'd have to reevaluate his opinions of the Saotome youth. It only dawned on him now that if Ranma was able to kill the Phoenix King by destroying his body, something that had been thought to be impossible, she'd be able to beat <i>him</i> easily. And yet he had been too far gone in his delusions to accept this and had carried on with his truly blind attacks.</p><p><b></b>It was just like Akane had said. He had been blind but now and not only due to the corrective surgery was he able to see things clearly. It was now dawning on him what for a kind of power he had been fighting in his quest to win Shampoo's love; it was really relieving to know that this kind of power was wielded by a person which such a high moral integrity.</p><p><b></b>Hmm, maybe it was not too late to form a friendship with Ranma, now that he, Mu-Tzu, had come back to reality. Aside from being a more than accomplished fighter she was also honourable beyond a doubt and always tried to keep her word. That Genma Saotome had caused so many problems in her life for which she was not to blame was not really Ranma's fault. Yes, once he'd have the chance he'd try to change his relationship with the Saotome youth.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo on her part was sad and happy on equal parts. Sad because she'd seemingly lost any chance to be Ranma's mate and happy because she had the chance to see him again. And in a glorious battle to boot. In the meantime she'd mostly come to terms with what her great-grandmother had done.</p><p><b></b>In the beginning after realisation had settled in she had nearly hated her great-grandmother; when all had been revealed to her she had been too stunned to object much. Furthermore she'd had to accept the decree of her great-grandmother. She as the Elder had the last word and it had been decided that her claims on Ranma were void. That had however not hindered her to throw several fits of rage once they'd been back at the Nekohanten.</p><p><b></b>Her great-grandmother had been patient with her and finally had made her see reason; or at least she, Xian-Pu had seemingly given in. In secret she was still weighing her choices; could she risk going against the wishes of the tribe and try to convince Ranma like she had tried to in the past and risk her own life? As far as she knew only Ukyo would be competition now that Akane had manoeuvred herself out of the field, thus it might be easier. Or could she be content with just being Ranma's shield sister?</p><p><b></b>She did not know as of yet. But she wanted to have a talk with Ranma as fast as possible to hear from him if it was really over. She'd never hear <i>him</i> say it. Depending on his answer she'd plan her course of action; when Ranma had gone onto the training trip with the nice girl Kasumi (she still shuddered at the despicable fate she had suffered) she had hoped that her former airen had mainly left Nerima to realise his feelings.</p><p><b></b>And even if Ranma should confirm that he did not love her, she did not want him gone from her life. Deep down she knew that she would most probably not risk disobeying the councils' orders should Ranma really say that he did not love her; <i>she</i> did love Ranma but she still did not know if <i>he</i> loved her. And until she didn't have definite knowledge about Ranma's feelings she'd not risk getting locked or killed for pushing her case.</p><p><b></b>She had realised in the last months that using potions, spells and other artificial means to 'convince' Ranma would never lead to the result she wanted, a Ranma who loved her of his own. If he really held no love for her in the marriage sense she would have to accept that. Whining and bitching, but she'd accept it. And if being his shield sister meant that she'd be able to continue to take part in his life she'd probably do that and be the best shield sister she could be. Shaking herself out of her musings she continued to watch the fight.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>To say that Happosai was surprised would have been the understatement of the decade. The perverted old grandmaster had noticed that Ranma-chan had gotten a great deal better but that she was capable of such feats… amazing! It really seemed as if she was <i>toying</i> with Taro! Maybe it was really time he trained her for real…</p><p><b></b>Shaking his head he pulled out his pipe, lit it with a burst of ki and watched. Analyzing the fight he noticed that her greatest asset was her vastly improved speed. The redhead was able to move faster than even <i>he</i> could see! That was confirmed once more when Ranma-chan ducked a punch aimed at her ribcage with astounding ease. The retaliation that followed in form of a lightning-fast roundhouse-kick to the head could only be described as brutal. Yes, it seemed indeed that Ranma-chan had also gotten a lot stronger and was not holding back any more.</p><p><b></b>The grandmaster of the Anything Goes watched fascinated as Ranma-chan seemed to flow around the powerful blows of Pantyhose Taro with an effortlessness he had not witnessed in a long time. She used each and every flaw in his defences and only Taro's toughness had prevented him from going down up till now. The fight had lasted for ten minutes now but it was already clear who had the upper hand. Happosai had to admit that even he would be hard pressed to beat Ranma-chan, even if he went all out. That Ranma-chan had managed to beat him by surprise was more than conclusive proof for that.</p><p><b></b>He winced when Ranma landed a very fast and hard kick to the snout of Taro's cursed form and marvelled that Ranma was so unrelenting in her attacks; her follow-ups were clear and precise, and most of all fast. Something had to have happened while the boy had been away, and that something had had an impact on his fighting style. Ranma was now fighting more ruthless, he wasn't treating his fights as simple competitions any more. Whatever had happened, he'd have to learn exactly what had happened.</p><p><b></b>Happosai shook himself from his musings just in time to see how Ranma landed a powerful blow to the left cheek of Taro. Once more said cursed youth was sent flying not under his own power and for the umpteenth time this day he wondered what had changed about femboy. What had caused this ridiculous increase in power? And damn, he seemed to be more ruthless than ever before for that last punch had really hurt!</p><p><b></b>Well, time to see if he couldn't teach him a lesson with a combined attack. Bringing his flight under control he turned around sharply and released ink from both his hands at the same time. And at the same moment also his tentacles shot forward and actually managed to ensnare Ranma in mid-leap.</p><p><b></b>Taro gloated while especially Nodoka had a look of horror on her face; even Genma seemed to be worried and his elation about the prowess of his son-turned-daughter was gone like the wind. Happosai for his part looked completely unconcerned and was smoking his pipe. The cursed Chinese boy just readied himself to pile drive Ranma into the ground when the redhead suddenly ceased struggling.</p><p><b></b>The Niuhoomanmaorenniichuan cursed youth paused in his actions with a puzzled look on his bull-face. He'd expected femboy to fight and struggle till the end but instead he had an odd look on the face. Something akin to… pity? What was he up to now?</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part looked him straight into the eye. "Sorry 'bout what I'm gonna do now. I wanted to avoid this but you leave me no choice. This is gonna hurt you more than me…" she said, twisting a well known saying.</p><p><b></b>Pantyhose Taro still puzzled over that when Ranma suddenly yelled. This yell indicated the beginning of another power-up and to free herself she flared her fiery battle-aura to its full extent. Unsurprisingly the heat she exuded was unbearably hot for Taro and due to the fact that the tentacles he had gained were appendages of a water-life form they did not take well to heat.</p><p><b></b>With a yell of pain Taro was forced to release Ranma and said girl leapt backwards with several somersaults immediately. She was now intent to end the fight before anyone could get hurt any further. Seeing that Taro was too busy with the pain he was in she had time to ready her attack.</p><p><b></b>Once more she cupped her hands to the side and began to gather her ki. "KA… NE… MO… KU… HAAA!" she yelled and the huge yellow beam exited her palms.</p><p><b></b>She had gauged the energy-level of the attack carefully and it would either render Taro unconscious or leave him barely conscious. At any rate he'd be unable to continue the fight. The redhead watched as her attack headed for Taro and when the cursed Chinese boy noticed the energy wave heading for him he reacted just like Ryoko had. His eyes widened and he looked like a deer caught in the headlights of a huge car.</p><p><b></b>Then the attack engulfed him and Taro had no chance to defend himself at all and his thoughts were <b>'Damn, what the hell is that?'</b>. The attack washed over him and carried him over the ground several yards before he came to a halt in a smouldering crater, groaning and with barely enough energy left to remain conscious.</p><p><b></b>To say that the others except Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko were baffled at the attack Ranma had executed would have been an understatement once more. Cologne on her part nodded to herself; so that was what she had felt some time ago, repeatedly. Most impressive. Happosai had a calculating look on his face that revealed nothing.</p><p><b></b>Mousse on his part reaffirmed his resolve to initiate a friendly relationship with Ranma; and Shampoo was proud that Ranma had defeated the fellow Chinese youth; she had never liked the arrogant young man. Nodoka was pride incarnate as she had watched her daughter battle something that could only be described as a monster from the legends.</p><p><b></b>However this monster was in reality a young man who had been faulted by Happosai; but as usual the blame had been shifted on her child. Her glare told a certain perverted grandmaster of the Anything Goes that anything would indeed go once she got a hold of him.</p><p><b></b>The old lech was just about to make a run for it to recover his energy when he suddenly ran into a funny shaped wall. Ryoko had seen what the old perv had been planning and had teleported in his way; and due to the fact that he had not been powered up the toughness of Ryoko had been enough to knock him out. With a satisfied smirk Ryoko picked the old pervert up by the scruff of his neck and teleported over to where the others were standing. He'd not escape his just punishment…</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma had walked over to check on Taro. As she scanned his aura she noticed that he was indeed barely conscious; that meant that she'd gauged the energy-level of her attack carefully enough. Regardless of that it had left her very much drained. But who cared now? She'd won; and for the first time this was a crystal clear victory against Taro.</p><p><b></b>Now the problem remained of changing Yak-boy back; but she'd just the right means to do so. As not much water was needed to change a cursed individual back she surmised that a bucket of water would be enough. Gauging from his aura Ranma mused that Taro would be out of it for several minutes which would give her enough time.</p><p><b></b>Using her Amaguriken speed she disappeared and reappeared in front of Ryoko. A smile graced her face. "Good job in catching the old perv. But could you do me a favour? I need ta change yak-boy over there back to his normal self. Therefore I need hot water. Could you get me some water out of the koi-pond? Preferably in a steel bucket."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko smirked and handed Happosai to the next best person who turned out to be Ayeka. "I gotta better idea, Red. I teleport us over to the Tendo place and ya go to the bathroom and do it yerself. How does that sound?"</p><p><b></b>The others laughed as Ranma grumbled. Finally the redhead nodded. "'Kay, demon woman. Let's do it."</p><p><b></b>A smirking Ryoko grabbed Ranma by the arm and teleported the two of them to the Tendo Dojo. Ranma then went to fetch a bucket with hot water and once they were done she teleported them back. As Ryoko had seen the place before she was able to teleport right in front of Taro.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked at her which meant so much as 'Thank you' and upended the water over Taro's cursed form. The two noticed that the others had joined them. Tenchi and Ayeka who had apparently hindered Happosai's return to consciousness as several lumps proved watched utterly fascinated how the huge monster suddenly shrunk and became a man. "Wow's" were exclaimed by the three visitors and the others could not fault them. Jusenkyo curses <i>were</i> something mind-boggling, no doubt about that.</p><p><b></b>They watched as Taro slowly regained full consciousness and propped himself up on his arms. "Take it slowly, hotshot. And no more attacks on my daughter." said a Nodoka who had her katana drawn.</p><p><b></b>Her facial expression left Taro with no doubt that she would use it if he made one wrong move; her stance showed that she was more than skilled enough to make good on her threat, and besides, not much skill was needed to behead someone anyway. Inwardly he asked himself if taunting femboy for being called 'daughter' would qualify as 'wrong move', but he decided to better not risk it. However, Taro announced his dissatisfaction with the situation to the universe at large with a few well-chosen words spoken under his breath.</p><p><b></b>Femboy however surprised him. "It's okay, mom. I can understand him. He just wants to be rid of that stupid name Happosai cursed him with and he got so obsessed over it that he stopped caring what his quest did ta others. But it's really high time that he gotta choose his own name. Isn't it so, 'master' Happosai?" she asked with velvet-clad steel in her voice.</p><p><b></b>She'd known that the old lech had been faking unconsciousness so that he would be able to absorb some ki from Ayeka once the time was right but Ranma thwarted his plans. A tap on his shoulder was the only warning and when he turned around he saw that Ranma was standing behind him. He tried to look innocently but Ranma-chan just gave him a glare.</p><p><b></b>The next he knew was that he was lifted up by the scruff of his neck and his tiny arms were too short to touch Ranma-chans breasts which would have given him the much needed energy to escape. Apparently helpless he could do nothing but protest verbally as he was carried over to where Taro was lying.</p><p><b></b>Said Pantyhose Taro was quite surprised at the actions of someone he considered as an opponent. He thought back to the time when he had tried to douse the old perv with water from the Spring of Drowned Virtuous Man; sadly that water had turned out to be water from the Spring of Drowned Twin and if he'd actually managed to splash Happosai with it the world would have suffered under two Happosai's'. There and then femboy had tried to help him as well as during the whole Rouge-incident. He'd have to think about what that meant later. Right now his chance to change his name was in his grasp! Besides, thinking right now just hurt too much.</p><p><b></b>As Ranma held the pervert down on Taro's eye-level a manic glee filled his eyes. Finally he had the old perv right where he wanted him! That he had baptised him in the Niuhoomanmaorenniichuan Spring was not so bad as he had literally grown up with his cursed form; he liked the strength and toughness it offered and would never have sought out a cure. But the name he had been cursed with was a different matter entirely.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi on his part wanted to know the backgrounds and stepped forward. "Hello, I'm Tenchi." he said to Taro and the cursed young man surveyed the newcomer.</p><p><b></b>This Tenchi handled himself like a fighter and for today he'd had enough fights. "What do you want?" he asked bluntly, while getting up. Nodoka had stood aside on a nod from Ranma, but she was still ready to take action if it was needed.</p><p><b></b>"Well, I'd like to know why you attacked my friend Ranma here. It's clear that it has to do with this old man here," at this Happosai glared futilely, "but I'd like to know more." Tenchi elaborated.</p><p><b></b>Taro sighed. He really hated to tell this story as it always served to embarrass him so much. But the thought that it would all be over soon gave him the patience he needed to tell his tale. "To make a long story short, this sick old man over there baptised me in a cursed spring at Jusenkyo. But the Jusenkyo curse I received was not the worst. Not by far. The curse was and is the name that sicko gave me. He had the gall to name me Pantyhose Taro! I hate that stupid name!" he yelled and snatched Happosai out of Ranma's grip; then he proceeded to glare daggers at Happosai.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi sweatdropped, as did Ryoko and Ayeka. All three refrained from snickering or cracking jokes about it as it was obvious that it was a very sensitive matter for the young man. And fighting they had had enough for today. "I… see." Tenchi finally said. "But couldn't you just change your name on your own?"</p><p><b></b>The Niuhoomanmaorenniichuan cursed youth shook his head. "It is a tradition in my tribe that only the one who gave the name can change it. And sadly that was the sick old man over there." he yelled and pointed at Happosai who was still being held by Ranma; he blew a raspberry at Taro but a bop on the head courtesy of the cursed youth ended his antics quickly.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part smirked. "But now the tables have turned on ya, old lech. And if you don't give Taro the name he wants ta have I'm gonna show ya a world of hurt ya never visited before in your 300 years. Got me?" she asked with steel in her voice and eyes.</p><p><b></b>Happosai gulped. The way Ranma had said that left him with little doubt that she'd do exactly that if he did not comply. Was the practical joke he had played on Taro since his birth really worth risking his continued good health? Considering all things... yes! But as he was still tapping into his hidden reserves he had to bide his time.</p><p><b></b>And considering the fact that Ranma-chan had defeated Taro rather soundly put him in a tight spot. Taro was the only one who'd ever defeated him lately and now Ranma-chan had defeated them both within the day. It seemed as if he had no other choice but to play along for the moment. "Okay, okay. I will change his name. But hear my words, you'll regret this!" he exclaimed pompously.</p><p><b></b>Another bop to the head stopped his tirade rather efficiently. "Can it, old lech. Yesterday I destroyed something that could have wiped the floor with five of yer kind. I'm tired of those idle threats. Instead of fooling around ya should teach students how ta defend themselves! A martial artist has to defend the weak and that's why we teach them - so that they learn how ta defend themselves! Or have ya forgotten that, 'master'?"</p><p><b></b>That remark made Happosai rather thoughtful, as much as he hated to admit it, for it hit too close to home for comfort. Cologne on her part who had heard the whole conversation was rather proud of her sometimes-pupil. Not only had she managed to defeat Taro in his cursed form but she'd managed to make Happosai pause to think.</p><p><b></b>According to her knowledge that only ever happened twice in a century. Maybe his defences would crumble when she added her own opinion. "Ranma is right, Happi. Fooling around from time to time is acceptable but you have done nothing else ever since you escaped your incarceration. It is time that you faced up to your responsibilities as the grandmaster of an Art of war. I admit that I have made my share of mistakes with Ranma too but at least she learned from me. What happened to the accomplished teacher I came to know 200 years ago, Happi? I can't believe that you've forgotten how enjoyable it is to teach."</p><p><b></b>Her remark sent Happosai deeper into a bout of thoughtfulness. He'd really have to think about that… alone and preferably with a nice sack of skimpy underwear. Taro however was getting impatient. "Hellooo! I'd like to get my new name and then you can do whatever you want with the old sicko! I've got no time for silly tea-parties!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. As interesting at that had been, Taro was right. First things first. "Okay, Taro. Shoot!"</p><p><b></b>Taro grinned. That was the moment he had waited for his whole life. Finally, finally he'd be able to get rid of that curse of a name! The irony that someone who he thought of as an opponent had helped him was not lost on him but at the moment he did not care. "I want to be known by the name of Ultimate Taro!"</p><p><b></b>All present shared looks. That was just as bad as last time when he had wanted to be named Awesome Taro, but then again, <i>he</i> would have to live with the name. Ranma gave Happosai a jolt and the perverted grandmaster sighed. Ranma reached into her stuffspace and extracted a bottle of water she always carried around with her. She had of course taken the precaution to fill it with boiling hot water at the Tendos in case anyone wanted to try anything stupid. This being Nerima that could never be ruled out.</p><p><b></b>To her satisfaction Ranma noticed that Nabiki was a competent as ever; she as a pro was videotaping the whole thing. With a grin she winked at the middle Tendo daughter who winked right back. Then she turned her attention back on the events before her nose and handed Happosai the bottle.</p><p><b></b>The old lech sighed once more. Then he opened the bottle... and sprayed Ranma with it! The water blinded her momentarily and the perverted master escaped Taro's grip effortlessly and blew a raspberry at him. His surprise at the fact that Ranma had not changed genders he overcame fast enough. After all, this was Ranma, and the unusual was usual in her case. "Heh heh heh, I'm never going to change your name, <i>Pantyhose</i> Taro. Not till the day I die!" he exclaimed cackling.</p><p><b></b>Taro seethed and lunged at the old pervert who avoided the attacks laughing and taunting. Before anyone could have stopped him he cackled one last time and made himself invisible.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part was seething too. Here she had had the old lech where she'd wanted him and Taro let him escape. She shook her head and breathed deeply to clear her head and senses. Stretching them out she tried to feel the aura of the old lech; but as much as she tried she found no trace of him. It seemed that the perverted master had actually a cloaking technique at his disposal that was even better than her fathers' Umi-sen-ken. Sighing she looked at Cologne who shook her head too. Happosai was gone.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>The exit of the diminutive pervert had surprised everyone. But in one case the surprise turned into anger quickly. "Femboy! How dare you let him escape! This is entirely your fault!" Taro bellowed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part shook her head and tried to remain calm. Insulting the bull-headed idiot would achieve nothing. "And how is it <i>my</i> fault when <i>you</i> were the one holding him?" she countered with logic.</p><p><b></b>The Niuhoomanmaorenniichuan cursed youth steamed. "It's <i>always</i> your fault! You should have stopped him! Now I'll be cursed with that stupid name for forever! DIE!" he exclaimed and lunged for her; or more specifically the half-filled bottle that was laying discarded on the ground. And due to the fact that it had remained open it might just have cooled down enough in the last minutes to allow Taro to change.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's eyes widened when she noticed what he'd planned. Against his cursed form she'd hardly stand a chance now that she'd used the best weapon in her arsenal in the previous fight; the Kanemoku-wave always left her ki-reserves so damn dry that it wasn't funny and she'd need some time and foremost food to recuperate. But she'd planned the outcome differently anyway. Sigh. It seemed Fate always had it in for her. Heck she wouldn't be surprised if her life was the main source of entertainment for a lot of Kami.</p><p><b></b>Using all of her ki that was left she tapped into her Amaguriken-speed and actually managed to kick the bottle away. Incidentally it landed right in front of Tenchi and his fiancées. The young man knew of the importance of the bottle for Taro, knelt down in a flash and emptied it of its contents while looking at Taro with a hard expression.</p><p><b></b>Taro stopped himself in mid-lunge and snarled at Tenchi as if about to attack. In response Tenchi used two of his Lighhawk wings to form his armour and sword and the air crackled with power; Ryoko formed her energy-blade and Ayeka let her Juraian powers come to the fore as well. It was an impressive show of power and brought home the point that Pantyhose Taro was completely outclassed.</p><p><b></b>With yet another snarl Taro whirled around and attacked Ranma who he thought to be weakened from their previous fight; weakened Ranma was indeed but not so much that she would not have been a match for the human form of Pantyhose Taro. How the Niuhoomanmaorenniichuan cursed youth had once stated, what did he need training for if he had the springs?</p><p><b></b>Right now that conviction held nothing good for him as he had absolutely no way to transform. But the furious state he was in obviously made him forget that he was just no match for Ranma in his normal form. Not since Ranma had improved so much while his skills has remained stagnant. His straight-forward kick which would have shattered very thick concrete had he been in his cursed form was blocked effortlessly and Taro was much too slow to block the counter that followed. Ranma's fist connected with his jaw in a classic uppercut that sent the offending bull-headed youth straight into LEO. His cry of "I'll be back!" slowly faded in the distance.</p><p><b></b>As Ranma had put quite a lot of her strength into that punch she had sent him quite far; probably right into the Adachi ward, if she was lucky. Soun, Nodoka and everyone else congratulated Ranma to her victories and even a certain sometimes panda muttered a "Not bad."</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part accepted the congratulations, but inwardly she sighed. <b>'When will idiots like Taro finally get a clue and grow up?'</b> she thought with a sigh.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi patted his childhood-friend on the back. "Is life usually this crazy around here, Ranma?" he asked only half in jest.</p><p><b></b>The redhead looked at him with a grimace. "Would you believe me if I said that it was a good day?"</p><p><b></b>Needless to say that the three non-Nerimans had to rewind their jaws while Ranma smiled a lopsided grin. Nobody however saw the shadow that crept away unnoticed.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
