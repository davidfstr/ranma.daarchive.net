</div><p><b>Title</b>: A trip to self</p><p><b>Author name</b>: Trugeta</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by Rumiko Takahashi and VIZ as well as many others. No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 15: 'A walk in the park'</b></p><p><b></b>Kasumi and Ranma headed to the West from the training grounds. Their destination was now Okayama, the town Tenchi had been born and grown up. The Saotome youth hoped that Tenchi had not moved ever since they had written each other last, but he figured that he had to risk it. Not that he would tell that Kasumi. He'd cross this bridge if and when he had to.</p><p><b></b>Rather than taking the direct approach and use the train to get to Okayama, Ranma and Kasumi had decided to travel by padding it, to enjoy the nature and sights. After all, this was a trip to self, and where could one come in touch with oneself better than in nature? And the means of transportation was actually very satisfying for a certain Kasumi Tendo.</p><p><b></b>Meaning: Ranma was carrying Kasumi in his arms, much to her delight, and running rapidly without breaking a sweat. Which occasionally caused disbelieving stares from people they passed by, but considering Ranma's speed the two cursed individuals did not care.</p><p><b></b>At the moment they were crossing over from the Mlao planes near Higashi-Yamato to the next bigger city at the outskirts of the Tokyo prefecture, Oume, to be exact, their destination for the day. Kasumi and Ranma were enjoying the sights and nature around them, if they were not crossing through a city, that is. And even those had their occasional sights.</p><p><b></b>As they had to cross quite a few cities on their way through Tokyo prefecture, Ranma always tried to take the indirect routes that contained as much nature as possible. On their first day they had made good way and had actually managed to reach their destination Oume, and to save money Ranma and Kasumi had pitched up their tents in the wilderness around Oume after the pigtailed martial artist had scouted the area for any dangers.</p><p><b></b>Strangely enough the odd downpour had changed the two into their cursed forms just before they had reached Oume. Slowly, and mostly because of Kasumi (who was 'suffering' the same fate), Ranma found the unexpected changes easier. They still annoyed him, because one could never be prepared when one would change next.</p><p><b></b>One of the most irritating factors of his curse was the sheer difference in sizes between the forms. As a girl Ranma was barely 5 feet tall, whereas his guy form was nearly 6 feet tall as of now. The difference in reach and size was enormous for a martial artist, and it had reassured Ranma somewhat when Cologne had told him that his girl-form would actually hit a growth spurt or two once he'd stay a girl for a longer duration of time. But right now he was enjoying snogging Kasumi as a guy too much.</p><p><b></b>Being kissed as a girl still felt somewhat odd, but Ranma was getting used to it more and more. And it sure had a lot to do with the fact that Kasumi-otoko was a very good kisser. Besides, kissing Kasumi, regardless of the form was always wonderful…</p><p><b></b>After their tents had been standing they had set up a bonfire, heated up a kettle and changed back after some snogging while they waited for the water to be heated. Then they had continued the snogging. But one thing remained: Ranma still had difficulties to display his feelings for Kasumi when they were in company of people, and Kasumi mused that it would be hard to convince Ranma of the opposite.</p><p><b></b>She understood very well that he always had had to avoid showing emotions and affections because of the many different girls who were battling over him, and had he shown a positive response for one specific girl, a clobbering had usually followed. Ranma was a 'burned child' in that regard, and though she understood it, it disappointed Kasumi somewhat that they could not act like any other normal couple in public.</p><p><b></b>Not to exchange kisses or holding hands whenever she wanted to was making her sad, but for the sake of Ranma she was willing to wait. For she knew that it would be more than worth it. What they had discovered together in the last few days could only be described as the greatest thing ever for them. Kasumi knew that this had the potential to become a great love, probably the one greatest love of her life.</p><p><b></b>She knew that she already loved Ranma, loved him more than she had ever loved anyone else. The infatuation she had felt for Dr. Tofu was nothing in comparison, as if someone would compare a rowboat to a nuclear-powered battleship.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was showing emotions and affections when they were alone, loads of them. She barely remembered a time when she had felt so happy, so alive. Whenever she looked at Ranma she had the distinct feeling of a million butterflies fluttering in her stomach. She knew all the medical terms for the state of mind, but the dry theory paled verily in comparison to the real thing.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi had also thought about what her life would be like at Ranma's side; she had realised that it would be twofold, if the future would bring what she hoped. On one hand she hoped to go to college and become a doctor, which would be hard even on her. And on the other hand she'd be the support Ranma needed, the one who'd be there for Ranma, regardless of the form, regardless what Ranma decided for his future.</p><p><b></b>The Tendo girl also noticed how good it was doing her to be out of the house, and that was something she'd never have expected. It was so much fun to travel with Ranma, since he (occasionally she) told her a lot of things he'd experienced throughout his travels with his father.</p><p><b></b>Naturally they had found time to explore their feelings further, and out in the wilderness it was all no problem for Ranma to show his feelings, and when both separated into their respective tents after a heavy snogging session, both longed for the other to stay.</p><p><b></b>But decency had to be kept, and thus they slept in different tents. While each cursed individual was thinking of the other, sleep slowly claimed them.</p><p><b></b>The next morning started out wonderfully which Ranma noticed as soon as he had he crept out of his sleeping bag and out of the tent. The air was mildly fresh, and it promised to turn into a beautiful spring day. Ranma smiled to himself as he thought about his Kasumi, and he wondered to himself how much had happened lately.</p><p><b></b>For a change some very good things had happened to him. A now loveless engagement (at least on his part, after he had really tried everything in his book) had been dissolved, he had not been clobbered or malleted in days, and the absence of the former constant attacks made itself noticeable. He had slept much better and also felt much better than ever before. And the reason for all this, directly and indirectly, was sleeping peacefully in the tent next to his.</p><p><b></b>He could barely grasp how lucky he was. Kasumi was the most beautiful, caring, understanding (and so much more adjectives that he could not list them all) person and he loved her. He knew that he could not say it out loud just yet as some of his fathers' teachings were just too deeply ingrained into him; but some time he would be able to, and he was living for this day.</p><p><b></b>The day when her brown eyes would gleam even more, when her smile would shine even more brilliantly and she'd just say 'I love you too.' This thought, as nice and warming as it was brought also the negative side to fore, as he had to think about his father. The reason for most of his problems.</p><p><b></b>Due to oyaji, he had been socially inept for a long time, only ever so slowly was it getting better, because of Kasumi's help and his own intelligence. He knew that he'd a lot to catch up, but he had vowed to himself that he'd work hard to give Kasumi and himself the best possible life. He'd finish highschool with the (for him) best possible grades, and his father could harp at him as much as he wanted that it was a distraction to the art.</p><p><b></b>In fact, Ranma supposed that everything his father had kept from him had been done so with the intention to keep him ignorant, thus easier to manipulate. He loved his father, for which reason he did not know, but it was the case. But Genma Saotome was a lazy tub of lard. Once he'd be back in Nerima he'd show oyaji how the wind blows, Ranma style.</p><p><b></b>Ranma mused to himself what he'd do about Ukyo while he did a warm-up kata. He knew that his mom and Nabiki would look into it, but it was also his problem and he wanted to find a solution too. Suddenly smiling he nodded to himself. He'd include Kasumi in the approach to solve the problem. After all, did not couples solve their problems together?</p><p><b></b>After exercising for half an hour Ranma felt his hunger grow, thus he decided to look if Kasumi was about ready to wake up yet. He carefully scanned her aura and after some moments he nodded to himself. She was ready to wake up and was at present in a dream phase. Maybe kissing her awake was a good idea, he thought to himself with a devilish grin.</p><p><b></b>As silently as possible he approached the tent and equally silent Ranma worked the zipper of the tent. Holding his breath he crawled into the tent of his sleeping girlfriend, and once he was in the tent he surveyed Kasumi's sleeping form. The view which was presented to him took his breath away. Even in her sleep, with uncombed hair and everything she still was the most beautiful woman on this planet. Silently he thanked Kami-sama for this wonderful girl, and if he could have looked into Kami-samas office he would have seen the Allfather smile.</p><p><b></b>Ever so slowly Ranma leant down towards Kasumi's mouth, and as tenderly as possible he pressed his mouth on hers and kissed her softly. Apparently it was to her liking, for she responded in kind involuntarily, and an unconscious smile appeared on her face. Ranma deepened the kiss and put all of his feelings for this woman before him in it, and gradually Kasumi awoke.</p><p><b></b>Her first thought was a surprised 'Oh my!', but after the initial surprise at being woken up with a kiss she reciprocated in kind, this time consciously. A two-minute lip-lock later Kasumi had to come up for air, and a content smile was plastered on her face. "This was the most beautiful way to be awoken I have ever experienced, Ra-kun. Thank you for this."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled back. "It was my pleasure, Kas-chan."</p><p><b></b>Afterwards the lovebirds engaged in a mid-morning snogging session, until Ranma's stomach protested loudly, demanding nourishment. Kasumi smiled and together they got up and prepared breakfast from the supplies they had brought with them in Ranma's huge backpack.</p><p><b></b>Once they had eaten Ranma and Kasumi repacked the tents into the backpack and headed for the inner city of Oume. They were making good progress, and most of the time Ranma managed not to be too homesick. After all, he considered the Tendo house his home, the first real home he had had after ten long years on the road, so some feelings of homesickness were understandable.</p><p><b></b>Ranma also missed his mom. He'd only come to know her for somewhat more than five months now after over ten years of absence; the mom she was now turning out to be after she had him back was much more to his liking than the strange woman he had come to know as Ranko Tendo.</p><p><b></b>There and then she had also had her nice sides but she had acted as if she expected her son to be something akin to Happosai Jr. It was a good thing that she had changed her views; with the whole manliness crap off of his shoulders he was really relieved of a heavy load. He wouldn't have thought that it would make such a big difference, but it did. He was now feeling more carefree, even as a she. Even being in girl-form began not to bother him so much any more.</p><p><b></b>A while later Ranma and Kasumi were walking hand in hand until they reached the outer skirts of Oume, but when they reached a more populated area he let go of her hand. He noticed the disappointed look on her face, but he could not jump over his shadow. Not just yet. The phantoms of his past in Nerima, which was a very recent past, were still too fresh.</p><p><b></b>Whenever he had shown physical affection to any of the girls that had been chasing him, even an innocent smile, the others had jumped him instantly and had demanded attention or had clobbered him. How often had he just wanted to explode, telling them to bugger off in moments like those. No, that he did not miss at all.</p><p><b></b>For the next three months or more depending on the welcome they'd receive at Tenchis, this would be the past. To himself Ranma had vowed that he'd never let his past become his future ever again. Ranma felt how he relaxed more and more as the days progressed, and for the first time, due to his outside view he noticed that the levels of stress he had existed before had really been incredible.</p><p><b></b>Now he felt that he was slowly getting some control over his life, and he vowed that he'd never return to a life like that, come hell or high water. And should stupid pops interfere, it would be kapowie to the moon. Bah, baka pops and his stupid ideas and convictions! Should he live by them and get beaten up by mom, which was something the baka panda deserved anyway.</p><p><b></b>But that was now over and done with, now he'd just enjoy life as much as possible without constant interference. Walking side by side the two followed the signs that led them to the inner city. And just like in any city there always were people who watered their beautiful garden. And once more Kasumi got firsthand proof that the curse did indeed turn its victim into one hell of a water magnet.</p><p><b></b>The two barely had the time to exclaim a "Hey!", before they were hit full force by a ray of water. A middle-sized and middle-aged friendly looking woman leant over her fence, and looked at them in an apologetic way. "Oh my, did I catch you with that? I'm sorry!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko looked at each other, then smiled and shook their heads at the woman. "No harm done, lady." Ranma said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded his assent, and with a wave at the woman the two continued their way. Actually, changing together was not so bad, and it had to be noted on the funny side that they did now really make the perfect couple. They even stayed a couple after they had changed into their cursed forms.</p><p><b></b>Silently Ranma snickered to herself as she looked at Kasumi-otoko, which caused the latter to raise a brow at his companion. "What is so funny?" he finally asked, after Ranma had snickered for half a minute.</p><p><b></b>"Oh, nothing," was the answer, "only that you look good all wet like this." she said with more guffaws. "And when I compared your handsome self to stupid pops when he gets doused I just lost it." Ranma said with a fresh bout of snickers.</p><p><b></b>Now Kasumi-otoko joined it. The mental image of Genma Saotome, both in panda-form and when he was human, wet from head to toe, was just too funny. He had seen it often enough himself and Genma had always looked remarkably like a doused panda, in both forms. How often had she thought the same thing when he as a she and had changed the panda into a human with the kettle of warm water.</p><p><b></b>Before, he had always done the polite thing and had displayed no outward sign of amusement so as not to laugh at the cost of an honoured guest, but now that he was far away from home he could give in to the hilarity. "Yes," he said with the beginnings of laughter, "your father does indeed look utterly ridiculous when he gets wet. Stupid doused panda… hah hah hah!" he finally exclaimed and half collapsed in laughter.</p><p><b></b>That the people who passed them by started looking strangely at them did not matter much to the two, laughing about the idiot panda was just too much fun. Finally they collapsed into each others arms, but after some moments Kasumi-otoko felt Ranma stiffen. With a sigh Kasumi-otoko thought that she'd now separate again from him as they were in public, for affections in public still special rules applied. Namely: no affections in public.</p><p><b></b>However, a sudden inspiration struck Kasumi-otoko and he half-grinned to himself. That had worked before, and who knew, maybe it would work again. "Ranma-chan, I know that you want to escape from this hug but I enjoy it very much. I also know that your father taught you that showing emotions and affections, especially in public, is something that is not done. And for your father, who probably does not show any emotion towards your mother outside from situations when they're in private, that may be okay. But you, you are not your father. In the last few months you have realised that so many of your fathers teachings were not worth the oxygen he needed to voice them, and this is not different. It is right that emotions can be a hindrance in a fight if you let them rule you, like it often happened with Ryoga or my little sister in the past." he said while softly stroking her silky red hair. "However, in your case this is not true. Infact, the opposite is true, you're TOO much in control of your emotions."</p><p><b></b>He sighed before he continued and Ranma looked up at him with questioning eyes, wanting him to continue. "But the mistake you are making is that you follow this teaching even in any other situation except for when we are in private. That is not the right way, my Ranma-chan. We are a couple now, and I love you very much. And people who love each other don't shy away from showing affections or emotions to each other. So what do you think are rules for public behaviour for, hmm?" he asked with a smile. "Holding hands, kissing and hugging in public is nothing any sane person would frown upon, my love. There is nothing perverted in this. It is accepted by society, and also needed by society, for love and its display are a great inspiration for others. Forget that you are in cursed form, for it is the person inside that counts." the cursed Tendo child said with a smile and paused to take a breath.</p><p><b></b>"Also in public, Ranma-chan. And forget suppressing your emotions outside from your fights and battles, for if you do it will always limit you and how far we will get with our relationship. I know this is very hard for you but maybe this will help: each time you think about shying away from me in public think about how the panda would react if you do the exact opposite of what he wanted you to do. Remember, in battles it is more than okay to suppress your emotions, but aside from that, it is not always necessary. Now how would the panda react if we, say, kissed in public? Imagine his face."</p><p><b></b>Ranma first scrunched her face at the concept but she could not deny that what Kasumi-otoko had said was the truth. If she would always suppress her emotions in every day life they would never get as far as they could. Did she not strive to get the best results in everything? She wanted this to work out, for this was the first great reciprocated love she felt. As things looked the only one she'd need for the rest of her life to be happy. And this was the woman, eh, man at the moment, she wanted to spend the rest of her life with.</p><p><b></b>She loved Kasumi like she had never loved anyone before, that she knew now. She had not loved Akane this much, not even during the phases when they had had something resembling a relationship. Did she really want to risk losing all this because of the stupid fat panda and his even more stupid teachings? What good had his teachings done her outside from martial arts anyway?</p><p><b></b>All that he had taught her outside from martial arts was utter rubbish. That she had realised with the help of Kasumi. Pops teachings and convictions about women were antiquated and so misogynistic that it was not even remotely funny, and she vowed to show him his place should he ever treat her that way again. Because of him she had been largely socially inept, and fitting into society had been next to impossible for her thanks to him.</p><p><b></b>Honestly with how she had been brought up by him, the idiot had expected her, or rather her male side, to marry one of the Tendo girls and have a fulfilled life? How on earth should an ignorant macho stud who knew nothing about women except that they were apparently useless have a fulfilled and happy marriage?</p><p><b></b>She had to admit to herself that she, or rather her male side, had been exactly this, an ignorant macho stud with next to no knowledge about women. Her confidence and attitude had attracted a lot of women, sure, but she had not known how to deal with them. To be honest to herself, it was incredible how much she had not known, and only ever so slowly she was catching up with normal youths her age. For this alone the panda deserved a lesson he'd not forget any time soon. In the meantime her mother could tell him her 'greetings' for her, she thought with an evil smile.</p><p><b></b>Slowly she began to learn more about women and what they wanted, and what her father had taught was surely not included in any of it. Kasumi was right, she really should shoot his stupid convictions out of the window. Could it really hurt to show affections? Would anyone jump her if she kissed Kasumi? And what he had said really began to crack her up.</p><p><b></b>The mental image of a red-faced panda who was waving his stupid signs frantically, which read # <i>What the hell do you think you're doing?</i> #, and her answer "Enjoying a nice, public kiss with the person I love." caused her to snicker.</p><p><b></b>Pop would really blow a fuse, which was exactly what he deserved. She snickered to herself at the mental image for some time, then her face scrunched up in determination. "Everything you said is right, Kasumi. I know that, but it will be hard on me to overcome what which ruled my life for more than ten years. You understand that, don't you?" she asked with a cute look on her face.</p><p><b></b>He nodded, and smiled down on her. "Yes, I understand it perfectly. And it would be my pleasure to help you overcome it, little by little. Take as much time as you need, my Ranma-chan, I will be waiting for you." he said, and the love he felt for the redhead before him showed in his smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled back thankfully. "Thank you. I'm glad that you understand me. That was always the problem with Akane. She knew of my upbringing and she knew how hard it was for me to show emotions and affections at all. Despite that she always thought I'd be doing 'it' with the other girls. Why? Why did she trust me so little? It makes no sense."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko deepened the hug and stroked her hair again. "I know it is hard to understand, but little sis really did not know how to deal with you. All that she knew about boys thanks to Kuno was that they are perverts who wanted to have their way with her. That you did end the morning fights did also not sit well with her for it undermined her status as a martial artist. She wanted to solve her problems by herself, but then you came along and defeated the mob single-handedly and in a way that made it clear that they better not mess with you. I myself still don't fully understand why she did not trust you, and maybe she does not know herself. But you can rest assured that you tried everything to make it work between you. It was just not meant to be."</p><p><b></b>Slowly Ranma nodded and got out of the hug. "I guess you are right." she said and looked in his brown eyes. 'Little steps.' she thought to herself, and tentavely reached out with her hand. Delighted but carefully, Kasumi-otoko stretched his own hand out, and when the hands met he took her much smaller hand into his larger one.</p><p><b></b>His smile said 'Thank you times one million' and Ranma smiled back shyly. Suddenly a flash of a camera could be seen and felt, and when the stars dancing in their visions had cleared they saw a woman of estimately fifty years of age, whose digi-cam was dangling from her neck. She was apparently a tourist, and from her looks she could have been European or American. And the smile she was wearing reached her eyes. "You two just looked so cute together, so I had to take a photo. I hope you don't mind." she said in English.</p><p><b></b>Ranma, who had always pretended to be very bad in English understood perfectly, and that due to the fact that she had learned English as an international language on their trip early on. But upon arriving in Nerima everyone had thought her a dumb jock, and why should she have showed them her true abilities when a passing grade had been more than suffice? She'd let them live with their believes of her, and passing grades had always been suffice.</p><p><b></b>And also Kasumi-otoko who had always been very good in English understood perfectly and answered for them. "Thank you. No, we don't mind. But would it be possible to get a copy of the photo?" he asked politely.</p><p><b></b>The woman nodded, and in the next minutes Kasumi-otoko gave the woman his mail-address, one of his throw-away-addresses to be exact, and the woman promised to mail the photo. With a wave and a smile they departed, and Kasumi-otoko took secret delight in the fact that they were still holding hands. Or maybe not so secret, gauging from his facial expression, which showed even more happiness when Ranma showed a shy smile herself…</p><p><b></b>This was a vast progress for Ranma and Kasumi-otoko mused to himself if it would be possible to get her male side to do the same. It was still much easier for Ranma to show emotions and affections as a female, and it would probably take a long time to remedy all what Genma Saotome had caused.</p><p><b></b>Should Fate decide that they'd end up married in the future, which he dearly hoped, then he'd assure that Genma would have no hand in the upbringing of their future children. The man was absolutely unfit as a parent, and as such, untold images popped in Kasumi-otoko's head of what he could do to their own kids.</p><p><b></b>Moments later he smiled at his thoughts. He was already thinking of having kids with Ranma. Had anyone told him this a few months back, he would have declared the person insane. It was funny how things and outlooks changed.</p><p><b></b>Still smiling and holding hands, the two progressed on their way. Currently they were keeping an eye open for a place to rest, as Ranmas stomach had made itself noticeable, rather loudly. When it had done so she had blushed, but Kasumi-otoko had only laughed and waved it aside.</p><p><b></b>His comment had been "I know how much food you need, and honestly, I'd be worried on a day when you said that you had no appetite."</p><p><b></b>This had caused Ranma to blush even more, and grumbling cutely she had walked on. Together they stocked up on their supplies in one of the local supermarkets, and once they were done they really wanted to find a place to relax. And finally they found a sign that told them that a public park was only one mile away, and both cursed individuals looked at each other and nodded. That sounded like an ideal resting place.</p><p><b></b>As they walked towards their destination, watching the houses they passed by, Kasumi-otoko voiced something that had been on his mind. "Ranma-chan, I have now been a man on and off for somewhat more than a week, and I admit that the boxers are useful. However, they're not the ideal solution, for after some time as a woman they simply get… uncomfortable. If you stayed a girl for as much time as me you'd notice."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked puzzled at Kasumi-otoko. "What do you mean?" she asked clueless. "I have never felt anything wrong with my boxers."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko blushed. "If you stay a girl for some time they get… ahh… really uncomfortable." he tried to explain. Still clueless look. "Okay, I'll be blunt: those things ride up something awful. And it's uncomfortable as hell. But as you never stayed a girl for too long in the past you never noticed."</p><p><b></b>Ranma thought about what he had said. <b>'Ride up something awful… ohh, he means up 'there'… oh my!'</b> she thought, and blushed.</p><p><b></b>This reaction showed Kasumi-otoko that Ranma had finally understood. "I… see." she said. "But what do we do about it?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled. Now they were getting somewhere. "Well, as we wanted to go shopping anyway, why don't we go into a store and look for alternatives? Surely there must be something else aside from boxers. Something that is more fitting for someone who is both male and female." he suggested.</p><p><b></b>Ranma pouted. "My beautiful boxers…" she complained.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otokos smile deepened. "How about a practical demonstration of how uncomfortable boxers really get after a while? Let's speed it up. How about we go into that park, find a public bathroom and you pull up those boxers a bit? This way you could see what happens after some hours. I dare you to do it."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked thoughtful. "And what do I get out of it?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled. She was leaning. "A nice and romantic kiss. Maybe more. You decide the forms."</p><p><b></b>Ranma pretended to think, but in all honesty, as love-starved as she still was this was nothing she had to think about for long. A smile graced her beautiful face, and she nodded. "Deal."</p><p><b></b>Together they went into the park, and like any good park it had a public bathroom, even though it was covered by odd graffities. Ranma looked at the barely readable signs and actually went to the women's side without complains, fact that surprised Kasumi-otoko somewhat.</p><p><b></b>Then Ranma entered the bathroom, and when she saw that it was empty she motioned for Kasumi-otoko to follow her. "You can change back already, and I will prove you wrong." she said, and went to a cubicle.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko grinned, used the warm water of the sink to change back and waited. Ranma did not take long, and moments later an "Eep!" could be heard, followed by hastily rustling of clothes.</p><p><b></b>A while later a blushing and somewhat disgruntled Ranma exited the cubicle. Her chagrined comment was "You were right. Those things do ride up something very awful. Yuck! So boxers are a big no no for girls. But what's the alternative for the time after the lock comes off? Guys can't wear panties. Hmm, maybe briefs… yeah, that could work." she mused to herself.</p><p><b></b>Absently she went to the sink and washed her hands in warm water, turning back into a he. Shacking himself out of his musings, Ranma looked at a smug looking Kasumi, who had a 'See, didn't I tell you' expression on her face. "Okay, okay, you were right and I was wrong. As for the forms, I'd say its okay as it is. But we should leave here before anyone comes in and sees a man in here. They'd probably think I'm a pervert or something." he said with a shudder.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded, but inwardly she sighed. It would apparently take a long time until the conditioned reflexes, reactions and thought pattern of Ranma would change from what Akane had made them back into something even akin to normal. But she'd see to it that they would. Her Ranma was already on a good way, and she'd be there for him and her all the way.</p><p><b></b>Together they exited the bathroom, and once they were outside the building Ranma looked around to make sure that nobody was nearby. Then, and only then he leant in to kiss Kasumi and despite the fact that she was disappointed by the fact that he ensured that nobody was around she enjoyed the kiss very much. But it was obvious that she'd really need a lot of time to get Genma's teaching out of Ranma's head…</p><p><b></b>Hand in hand they were slowly walking through the park, and when a sudden downpour occurred they just looked at each other and smiled. Changing together was actually fun, and it had been a very new and interesting sensation to change while one was holding hands. Ranma's strong and big hand which had formerly been the one 'protecting' Kasumi was now in the reversed role, and to be honest, it really did not feel so bad to be protected.</p><p><b></b>Why had stupid pops always claimed that a true martial artist did not need any source of comfort if it felt as good as this? Hmm, maybe it had all been because he had secretly missed mom, and burying it so deeply had been his only chance to forget it. But why had he dragged her down with him too? Did it make her any less of a person because she felt secure and protected? Hell no! Not to be always on guard and actually relaxing for once did her very good, and she felt how she leant into Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>They were so absorbed in their thoughts and enjoyed the moment, so that they did not notice the approach of several newcomers. Suddenly Ranma felt the painful sensation of being yanked back roughly by the hair. She barely had the time to yell "What the hell!" when an ugly looking youth whirled her around. "Heh heh heh, look what we have gotten ourselves here. Fresh meat and it walked so willingly into our park." the apparent leader of the gang said with a disgusting smirk. "And what a darn cute bitch she is…"</p><p><b></b>He was dark-haired and tall, nearly as tall as Kasumi-otoko in male form, but ugly as hell. And to her horror Ranma noticed that one of the other gang members, they were about ten in numbers, had pressed a knife to Kasumi-otokos throat. That's why his protests had been cut short. And there was no one in the area who could help them.</p><p><b></b>That figured. She was on her own, as usual. As inconspicuous as possible she surveyed their captors. All were clad in leather with some strange icon or symbol on the right shoulder, and every single one of them was ugly as hell. And to say that their leader was just ugly would really have been an insult to the word and the understatement of the decade.</p><p><b></b>And the leer with which he was surveying her gave her the creeps. Compared to this scum Happosai was a saint. "What do you want?" she demanded, embracing the soul of ice.</p><p><b></b>The leer of the guys deepened, and made them look like animals. Disgusting animals, Ranma thought, which had to be put behind bars. It was just a great disadvantage that this scum had pressed a knife to the throat of her love.</p><p><b></b>Feeling her up, the leader smirked. "What do ya think, cutie? A hot chick like ya that comes willingly inta the park of the Oume Prowlers, and ya ask what we want? Hah hah hah!" he exclaimed, and touched her boobs with a disgusting leer.</p><p><b></b>This caused Kasumi-otoko to struggle, as his new male hormones told him that he had to protect his love. However, he could do nothing, and his struggling caused the knife to cut into his throat. When Ranma saw the blood running down the throat of her love she saw red. And not only literally. Feeling her up that she could stand. Happosai had done it often enough. That did not mean that she liked it, but she could tolerate it depending on the situation.</p><p><b></b>But that this scum-bag had hurt her love shot the soul of ice right out of the window. What happened next happened too fast for the gang members to follow. At one moment their leader had the cute bitch in his grasp, and in the next moment he was lying on the ground in obvious pain while the redhead had disappeared. And just a second later Kuro, the guy with the knife, was rolling on the floor in pain too.</p><p><b></b>Ranma, who had appeared in front of Kasumi-otoko looked at the wound for a moment, and saw that her love was okay. Then she growled, and turned a pair of blazing eyes on the gang members. "You! You are the worst scum on this earth! How dare you threaten us like that! Feeling me up like that, you disgusting animals! Wanted to have your way with me, huh? Wanted to rape me! I'll show ya what messing with me means!" she exclaimed like in righteous fury, just like a fury from hell.</p><p><b></b>Now that she was knowledgeable about sex it made what those bastards had wanted to do to her so much worse. In the past she might have been satisfied with putting their lights out without hurting them too much, but that they had planned on raping her made her angry as hell. She had not made the connection between why the boys were interested in her girl-form and what they wanted to do with her for long, but that those perverts and rapists had wanted to take advantage of her incensed her so much that a rage-fit of Akane paled verily in comparison.</p><p><b></b>She did not notice that her battle-aura had come out in its full terrifying glory, and for the first time since long the gang members who had always felt so strong and who had gloried in the terror of others felt abject terror themselves. Unwittingly they had released something upon them that was so much more terrible than they were themselves. They would soon learn the lesson that you never wanted to be the catalyst that caused Ranma Saotomes temper to boil over. And right now Ranma was in an honest-to-Kami rage-fit.</p><p><b></b>With fiery steps she covered the distance and looked intimidating as all hell. At the same time she made sure that none of the scumbags could get in her back. Her love had fallen back so as not to give the would-be-rapists a chance to catch him and take him as a hostage. And then Ranma blurred into action. This time she did not hold back much, only keeping herself from inflicting lethal damage. Everything else aside from paralyzing those bastards was fair game.</p><p><b></b>Bones broke like wood under her blows, and when the gang-leader, who had recovered his wits, threw a knife at her, she just caught it with her right hand and snapped it in two with no apparent effort. Ranma turned her blazing eyes on him. "Now ya know what yer up against. Now ya know what happens ta those who want ta hurt my loved ones or me. And now ya wish that ya had never done it, eh? Now what, ya ask? I will make ya regret the day ya were born, that's what!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>In the blink of an eye she covered the distance that separated her from the leader, and moments later the ugly guy was sent flying by a vicious upper-cut landing heavily thirty feet back in a heap, barely conscious. His fellow gang-members looked at their fallen leader in shock, and their shock turned to surprise when they heard loud clapping.</p><p><b></b>The racket that had been made had caused several people to come down to the park from their adjacent houses, and one old woman gave Kasumi-otoko a clean hanky. He nodded thankfully, and pressed it on the cut, while he watched the still stunned gang-members. Well, they had picked on the wrong couple.</p><p><b></b>The old woman who had given him the hanky looked at him questioningly. "Is she your girlfriend, young man?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko blushed and nodded. "Yes, and she is really something else. Those bastards over there attacked us and wanted to rape her. Now they're paying the price."</p><p><b></b>The woman nodded. "It was high time that somebody did something against those creatures. The police are much too overloaded, and the gang-leader threatened that if anyone of us even tried to call them or get help, that we'd end up worse than dead. This has been going on for over a year, but it looks as if it's finally over."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded in reply. He had read of cases in which gangs terrorised whole neighbourhoods, but that had been the first time that he had come to experience it firsthand himself. But luckily his love was more than capable of dealing with those scum-bags. "Yes, I only hope that something will be left of those bastards after she is through with them. I have seldom seen her this angry." he said, as he watched how Ranma deflected two attacking gang-members, who had apparently recovered their wits, with ease.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko saw the others that were left of the gang smirk when they saw, how their leader got up. The ugly fellow reached into the pocket of his jacket and pulled out a gun. The cursed Tendo yelled out a warning to his love, but he needn't have to, as she had her guard up.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly a fiery aura blazed up around her, and when the leader fired several bullets at Ranma not one did make it through the fiery barrier. Each single bullet was molten lead before it could reach its intended target. The gang-leader checked his weapon to see if he had loaded the correct bullets, but he had. That was not false ammo! Growling he reloaded the weapon and fired once more on the nearing Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Once more the bullets were molten lead, but this time the remaining gang-members could actually see how the bullets melted away upon contact with that fiery thing. "Damn, what the freakin hell are ya, ya bitch? Die!" he exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Just as he wanted to load his gun with another round he felt how the weapon was yanked out of his hand like his grip on it was nothing. Moments later he looked into a pair of blazing eyes, and his own eyes widened as the redhead crushed the whole gun with one hand. Just like as if it was made of paper! His instincts told him to back away from this monster-turned-cute-woman, but suddenly he felt that he could not, as he was all of a sudden dangling from a steel grip around his throat.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked at him with fiery eyes. "Ya thought ya could escape yer punishment by shooting me, is that it? Well, think again!" she said and used her Amaguriken speed to inflict as much pain on her would-be-rapist as possible.</p><p><b></b>His bones broke like tissue, and when she had dealt with his already ugly face the guy slumped into painful unconsciousness. For good measure she touched a few pressure points on his back with her free hand, and smirked to herself as she thought about the effects they would have.</p><p><b></b>Then she let the leader slump down to the ground, and turned to the remaining gang-members, who began to back away in fear. "Run away!" one of them screamed to the others. "She is a monster!"</p><p><b></b>The old woman looked up at a smiling Kasumi-otoko and arrived at the correct solution. "She is a martial artist, isn't she? I have watched a news report about martial artists in Nerima, and how often did I wish that only one of them would stop by to deal with those sub-humans. But at even the hint of resistance those animals did awful things to us. Breaking bones was a sport to them, but now they reap what they sew."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. This was a very accurate assessment, especially considering the yelps of pain coming from the gang-members. "Yes, she is a martial artist, and one of the best there are. And yes, we are from Nerima." he said with a sheepish smile.</p><p><b></b>The old woman nodded, and Kasumi-otoko winched when he saw his Ranma kick one of the bastards up there. "Every action causes an equal, reciprocated reaction. Though it seems what with how my Ranma is handling them the reaction is unlike stronger. Not that those bastards don't deserve it. Ouch!" he exclaimed, as he watched his Ranma kick one of the other bastards up there.</p><p><b></b>And considering the force she had used it was quite likely that something had ruptured. Well, good riddance in that case. In the next ten minutes Ranma beat the remaining gang-members systematically into a painful unconsciousness, and not one of the would-be-rapists went without several broken bones, jaws, noses, black eyes and missing teeth.</p><p><b></b>When she was finished, Ranma had been very thorough in punishing the scum-bags, and it had been a special treat for her to use some specific pressure points due to which each and any member of the gang would be unable to perform for half a year. She just loved some of the pressure points Cologne had taught to her. Frowning at her handiwork she returned to her love.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girl knew that it had been necessary to put a stop to those guys, for what would happen if they happened to encounter a helpless couple, like they apparently had already in the past? It was clear that it had not been the first time that those bastards had ambushed and raped someone. No, it had been necessary. With her actions she had protected the weak, that was the prime and sworn duty of a martial artist.</p><p><b></b>Allowing her emotions to come to the fore she could not stop to reprimand herself in her mind how utterly stupid she had been to let her guard down like that. And what had happened? Kasumi had gotten hurt. Again. Some fine martial artist she was, if she could not even protect the one person she loved more than anything else.</p><p><b></b>She smiled politely at the people that were standing next to her love with big grins on their faces, but at the moment she only had eyes for Kasumi. She wanted to be sure that he was really okay. With a grim expression she surveyed the cut, and noticed to her relief that her original assessment had been right. The cut was not deep and was actually barely more than a superficial scratch. But what could have happened haunted her.</p><p><b></b>Sensing her state of mind Kasumi-otoko reached out and pulled her into a hug. When his arms closed around her, she allowed herself to fall into the embrace. An embrace she felt she did not deserve. Looking up with sad eyes she asked what was on her mind "How can you still hug me after I allowed you to get hurt? How can you still love me?" she asked, and nearly felt like sobbing. But as a true martial artist did not weep she repressed her tears. Crying was weak, and she did not want to be weak. Not in front of all these people.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was surprised when she felt a finger force her chin upwards, so that she looked into his eyes. "My Ranma-chan, not you allowed me to get hurt, and it was not you who hurt me. It was those bastards over there. Not you. And aside from that, nothing happened. This," he pointed towards his throat, "is barely a scrape. No, don't fret about what could have happened, because nothing has happened. And that is thanks to you. You saved me, and you saved us. If you had not been, then all these people here," he pointed at the people standing around them, who still wore thankful expressions, "would still be terrorised by those freaks over there. You did nothing wrong, my Ranma-chan."</p><p><b></b>The red-haired girl was still not convinced. "But it is my fault that they were able to attack us in the first place! Had I had my guard up…"</p><p><b></b>That was as far as she got. Kasumi-otoko laid both his hands on her shoulders. "Ranma, you are only human. Humans are allowed to relax, and that something happened while you did was a coincidence. And much more important, you were able to remedy your felt mistake just by yourself. Even by your own reasoning you did everything a true martial artist would do. You protected the weak, and aside from those guys over there no one got hurt. I'm proud of you, Ranma-chan, and I love you."</p><p><b></b>Under the catcalls and whistles of the people around them he gave his love, who blushed beet-red, a tongue-curling kiss, and applause ensued after they came up for air. A still blushing Ranma looked shyly into the round.</p><p><b></b>The old woman, who was standing next to them and who had talked to Kasumi-otoko beforehand, extended her hand, and Ranma shook it surprised. "Thank you for saving us from those creatures, Miss. We can not thank you enough for what you did. Would you mind telling us your name so that we can include you in our future prayers to Kami-sama? We want to pray for good luck for you and your boyfriend. You certainly deserve it."</p><p><b></b>A now once more blushing Ranma nodded shyly. "It was my pleasure. Guys like that disgust me, and they had to be stopped. My name is Ránmā Saotome, and this is Yoshiro Tendo. I am glad that we could be of help."</p><p><b></b>"So you are from Nerima." the old woman mused to herself, and Ranma looked surprised once more. The old woman just smiled at her. "I just told your boyfriend here," two blushing cursed individuals due to the statement, "that I often prayed to Kami-sama to send us one of the martial artists of Nerima. I had watched some of the fights on TV, and it seems as if Kami-sama finally listened to my prayers."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Yes, we are from Nerima. And I say it again, it was our pleasure."</p><p><b></b>The old woman, now obviously the spokeswoman of the group, looked at Ranma. "What can we do to reward you, Miss Saotome? I know we can hardly do anything to reward a feat such as this, but let us try." she said with a smile, and many of her companions nodded.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko just smiled. "There is no need to reward us." Kasumi-otoko said for the two, "Just see to it that those creatures over there get locked up and thrown into the deepest cell so that they may never harm anyone ever again."</p><p><b></b>One of the people nodded. "And that will happen. I just called the police, and for a change, they will arrive soon. When I told them that they tried to rape you, tried to shoot you and nearly killed your boyfriend they promised to come within minutes. Well, that was five minutes ago, but knowing the police…" he trailed off with a shrug.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded. Yes, if the police here was anything like the one they had in Nerima, it would take a while. And it really took ten more minutes. Minutes, which Ranma and Kasumi-otoko spent with talking to the group of people, while Ranma ensured that none of the gang-members got away. But nearly each and every member was still on a painful trip to lala-land, and only in one case she had to induce instant unconsciousness.</p><p><b></b>When the police had finally arrived, and they had actually done the sensible thing and had arrived with a larger vehicle and two standard police cars, they took the statements of Ranma, Kasumi-otoko and the statements of those who had seen the happenings to protocol.</p><p><b></b>The police captain grimaced when he saw the state his prisoners were in. He looked at Kasumi-otoko. "Did <i>you</i> beat them up so badly?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo shook his head, and with a chagrined smile Ranma piped up, "I did. Those guys really made me mad, and I flew somewhat off the handle."</p><p><b></b>As the captain surveyed the petite redheaded girl he could not hide his surprise. "<i>You</i> did that?" he asked incredulous, and when everyone nodded he had no other choice but to believe them and the redhead. "Umm, mind if I ask, but how does someone, umm, as small as you do something like that?" he asked, and pointed towards the groaning gang-members, who were presently either led or carried towards the bus.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked somewhat chagrined. "I am a martial artist, sir. And I am a lot stronger than I look."</p><p><b></b>The captain nodded his head. So much was apparently obvious. Then he remembered something, and surveyed the redheaded girl up close. "Say…" he suddenly said excited, "are you by any chance related to Ranma Saotome, the famous martial artist from Nerima? I mean, I just realised that your names are very similar!"</p><p><b></b>Now it was Ranma who was surprised. "Umm, yes, Ranma is my brother." she answered. "But how do you know him?"</p><p><b></b>The captain smiled. "Nearly everyone in Tokyo knows him. At the latest ever since that news report where he fought that other guy with the bandana and the umbrella. And his fights with the huge flying monster are legendary! Miss, tell your brother my commendment when you meet him next. He and his fighting spirit have been an inspiration for me and my troop. But it seems as if you take after him quite a lot, Miss Saotome…" he said with a deepening smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed. She was the inspiration for a whole troop of police officers? Or rather her male side? Damn, how weird could it get? Well, it was weird, but also cool at the same time. "Thank you, captain, I will tell him. Uhh, will you need anything from us in the future? For in the next few weeks we will be on a trip to a friend, and while we are at it we wanted to visit the nicest sights of the prefectures." she said.</p><p><b></b>The captain thought for a moment. "Where are you headed to?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl looked to Kasumi-otoko, and he nodded impalpably. "To the Okayama prefecture. Though we have no idea when we will get there. But you would be able to reach us via mail."</p><p><b></b>Again, the captain nodded. "I do not know as of yet if further statements will be needed on your part, but if this should be the case we will notify you via mail. Just give me your email-address, and we'll do the rest." he said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded and scribbled down her email-address on the offered slip of paper which she then handed to the captain. "Thank you for your cooperation. Now we have to go, duty calls."</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko nodded, and with a wave the captain boarded his car. Just when they were about to drive off, she could have sworn that she heard the captain say "Do you have any idea who that was, guys? Ránmā Saotome, the sister of Ranma Saotome! They're only spelled differently! Weird, eh?"</p><p><b></b>Then the door was closed, and the troop drove off. Ranma smiled to herself. Who would have thought that she, or rather her male half, had become a celebrity? Hand in hand Kasumi-otoko and she returned to the waiting group of people they had unwittingly helped, and in the adjacent minutes the two travellers were invited to an impromptu picnic in the park. An offer Ranma and Kasumi-otoko accepted all too gladly.</p><p><b></b>Finally they were seated on a large blanket they had to themselves, and a filled Ranma leant contently against her 'boyfriend'. Afterwards she enjoyed another good bout of food and good company. A day which could have ended badly had turned out for the better in the end, and after the feast was over Ranma and Kasumi-otoko said their good byes and travelled on.</p><p><b></b>Before they left Oume, however, they acted upon what Kasumi and Ranma had found out about the problem with the boxers, and bought a good dozen of briefs after verifying, that those were indeed better suited for girls. Ranma still bemoaned the loss of her beloved boxers, but even she had to admit that briefs were a lot more comfortable for a girl in the long run. They also had the good idea to buy thick undershirts for the both of them, for due to the fact that they both could not wear bras this was the most decent solution. Kasumi and Ranma were prone to changing, and thus a thick, black undershirt was called for. Decency had to be kept, and Kasumi was adamant about it.</p><p><b></b>Till nightfall they managed to make it to the Yamanashi prefecture, where they once more camped in the wilderness. Only that this time, after the exciting events of the day both cursed individuals rather wanted to share a tent. After changing back they engaged in a very much enjoyed snogging session, and when they finally called it a night they separated into different sleeping bags. Soon soft snoring noises could be heard, as two cursed individuals found a peaceful nights rest in each others arms.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group. I enjoy reading your comments, and the suggestions you all make will help to make this story even better.</p><p>If you find anything illogical that might have created a plot-hole or anything else that is wrong, let me know and I'll fix it.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
