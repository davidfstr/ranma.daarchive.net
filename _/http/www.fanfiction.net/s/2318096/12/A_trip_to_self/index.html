</div><p><b>Title</b>: A trip to self</p><p><b>Author name</b>: Trugeta</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by Rumiko Takahashi and VIZ as well as many others. No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 12: Training and Feelings</b></p><p><b></b>It took only three days to toughen Ranma-chan up to the level of Ryoga, and it was no surprise that the ki-technique to protect her breasts had worked as predicted. Cologne had once more been astounded at how easily the young Saotome improved. Ranma had been exhausted as hell after the first day and had fallen into a deep slumber, after a healthy lunch, of course, from which she had only awoken next day. That she had gone to sleep in female form had not really mattered to her, for she had been much to put out to care at the time.</p><p><b></b>During these three days Kasumi-otoko had trained himself to get fully used to walk and run as a man. Relearning these basics had been quite irritating, but due to the differences between the bodies also very necessary. The walking part had, with Ranma's help which the Saotome youth had already begun to provide at the Tendo Dojo, worked quite well. But Kasumi-otoko still had had difficulties with running because of the longer stride he now had. Though now, after three days, he had it down well enough to run without landing flat on the face. His way to walk was not the manliest way by far, and Ranma had already announced that she'd educate him later on how to walk properly as a man.</p><p><b></b>Cologne had also begun to show Kasumi-otoko some Tai chi exercises of her tribe which increased the awareness of ones own body, and the Elder said that these exercises would help him to get used to his new body. She also recommended that he should teach these exercises to Ranma to make it easier for her.</p><p><b></b>As for Ranma, it had been no surprise that she had mastered the technique flawlessly, and when she exclaimed the trademark "Bakusai Tenketsu!" for the first time, Kasumi-otoko exclaimed a whoop of joy at the sight of debris flying everywhere. Ranma, on her part, looked at her right index finger with a huge grin, and she was very satisfied that she had finally acquired the toughness to use this great technique.</p><p><b></b>During the time of the training Elder Cologne had had quite a lot of time to talk, and while she smashed boulders at Ranma she'd also taught Kasumi some of her knowledge regarding local and foreign herbs and fungi. And once more the Elder had been astounded as to how quick the oldest Tendo child was on the uptake. Maybe Tendo Kasumi was even intelligent enough to achieve knowledge comparable to that of an Amazon master healer should she ever decide to become a healer. Which was what Cologne highly recommended.</p><p><b></b>But Kasumi was still uncertain, and understandably the Tendo child wanted to get used to the curse first. Though the Elder was quite certain that Kasumi <i>would </i>attend college should the opportunity arise. She had sensed that Kasumi was slowly realising that she was now free of the chains that had bound her to the Tendo Dojo, and she (currently he) was acting more open and forward by the day.</p><p><b></b>Slowly it seemed as if the traditional Japanese housewife was evolving into something different, and Cologne was sure that Ranma would help Kasumi to become her own person in the duration of their trip. Though the male hormones and the inner fire Cologne sensed in Tendo Kasumi would surely also be of great help in that regard.</p><p><b></b>From time to time the Elder would catch a glimpse of homesickness in Kasumi, and it was no wonder that the Tendo child missed her relatives, as she had never been away from her home for a prolonged time. But Cologne was sure that Tendo Kasumi would overcome it, especially once the two youths stopped dancing around each other.</p><p><b></b>Inwardly Cologne was taking bets on how long it would take the two to admit their feelings to each other, feelings which were too obvious to miss. But until that would happen the Elder distracted the Tendo child with exercises, and it was already obvious that Kasumi was enjoying them and her stay here more and more.</p><p><b></b>The hardening procedure Ranma underwent had then been repeated the next day. All the time Kasumi (mostly in male form due to the odd downpour that occurred multiple times a day) had tended to Ranma, and Cologne could literally see the sparks fly between those two.</p><p><b></b>Too bad that it had not been possible to bring Ranma Saotome into the tribe as anything but an ally of the Joketsuzoku. But so Fate had decided, and the Amazons and she could be happy with what they had achieved. Ranma would be an excellent ally of the tribe, and to have Ranma's partnership would be much better than to have his enmity.</p><p><b></b>While Ranma had spend her time peeling herself off of boulders, and pushing her endurance and toughness to new heights with a determination seldom seen before in even her, Cologne had continued to instruct Kasumi in the basics of Tai chi and herbal knowledge.</p><p><b></b>After the toughening procedure was over for Ranma, the Elder was very pleased with the progress her students had made. Very few had a learning curve that could compare, and if things proceeded like that, she would be finished with teaching Kasumi-otoko the basics in four days. More than enough time and opportunity to teach Ranma in both forms the one or the other trick.</p><p><b></b>Today it would be the male Ranma's turn for toughening up, as he had the technique behind the Bakusai Tenketsu already mastered. But the toughening of the body was as crucial, for only going through the ordeal of having thrown boulders at one, one became impervious to the disastrous side-effects of the Breaking Point technique.</p><p><b></b>Ranmas' toughness which she had acquired after only three days of intense toughening up could now compare to that of Ryoga any time. Meaning, she was now nearly indestructible. Cologne wondered if Ranma-otoko's toughness would reach even higher heights. She would find out soon.</p><p><b></b>And find out she did. It seemed that the repetition of the toughening process, which took again three days, had indeed been useful in making Ranma-otoko even tougher than Ranma-chan. Even if not by much.</p><p><b></b>But due to the added toughness, Ranma could now compare to that of a tank anytime now. In addition to the powers Ranma had already displayed, it made the Saotome youth (in both forms) one of the greatest fighters in Japan and probably the whole planet.</p><p><b></b>It seemed, as if one of the dreams of the male fool Genma Saotome had come true: Ranma was now the best fighter of his/her generation, as far as she knew. And Cologne had to admit to herself, that she was damned proud to have taught him/her. But there were still a few tricks this one could teach him/her.</p><p><b></b>In the last three days, during the time they had used to toughen Ranma-otoko up, Cologne had also begun to show Kasumi-otoko some basic moves of Amazon Wu in addition to the Tai chi lessons. And it was surprising to the Amazon Elder, how well she had progressed.</p><p><b></b>For although Kasumi had not had much prior training (in fact she had started training in her schools' Art again ever since Ranma had renewed her interest in the Art through his/her constant fights) she did remarkably well. She seemed to soak up the forms and techniques as well as the abstract theory behind them like a sponge. Which came as a surprise.</p><p><b></b>Like Nodoka before her, Cologne came to the realisation, that there was much more to Tendo Kasumi than met the eye on first look. She was not as oblivious towards the world as she always had always pretended to be. In fact, she seemed to be <i>very</i> intelligent. To progress this far in such a short amount of time was certainly a big pointer in that direction.</p><p><b></b>If the Joketsuzoku treated Ranma right, and she would assure that her tribe did, they could maybe benefit from a (now quite likely) union of Saotome Ranma and Tendo Kasumi. Even if those two still seemed to be somewhat in denial. Cackling inwardly Cologne thought to herself, if she should just bop them over the head with her stuff and tell them to admit their feelings already. But for the time being she limited herself to watching. This was just too funny. Sometimes the life of Ranma Saotome seemed to resemble a soap opera more than anything.</p><p><b></b>Thinking back to her tribe Cologne grinned to herself. They had no a mighty ally instead of a mighty potential enemy. And if the Joketsuzoku could win their future offsprings as allies once they were old enough, they would then have ensured the tribes safety further. Yes, far reaching ties with the Saotome Clan were indeed desirable, should things work out the way Cologne hoped. If only the influence of the fool Saotome Genma could be removed…</p><p><b></b>Maybe Saotome Nodoka would act when she learned, what exactly Saotome Genma had done to Ranma on their training trip. As far as she knew, nobody had explained the Neko-ken to Saotome Nodoka as of yet. Hmm, maybe she should pay the Tendo Dojo a visit and let a few words drop. Accidentally, of course.</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded to herself. That would be satisfying, and surely in the best interest of the future couple. That they were about to become a couple was quite predictable. Cologne had watched the byplay, that went on and off between Ranma and Kasumi-otoko, and she was quite certain that her predictions were true. She had not over 300 years of experience in reading people for naught. Obviously they were <i>very</i> much attracted to each other, as well in their normal forms as in their cursed forms, which was always a plus for cursed couples with opposite curses.</p><p><b></b>The Elder had known several such couples throughout her long life, and she knew that they had had (and some still had) fulfilled and interesting marriages. For example, it had not always been the one <i>born</i> female that had given birth. But that was something far off-topic for Ránmā and Yoshiro aka. Ranma and Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>While Kasumi-otoko, who had decided to stay in male form now that they seemed to have a rainy day, continued to get the exercises Cologne had shown him down to perfection, the Elder began to teach Ranma some of the more potent techniques of the Joketsuzoku.</p><p><b></b>She had already faxed Ranma's acceptance to become an ally of the tribe to her fellow Elders, plus the conditions she had added herself, including her vote to accept at all costs, and she had already received the confirmation that everything had gone the way she had wanted it. There was no way to remove or alter Ranmas status now or in the future without a massive loss of face and honour on the tribes part, and no one would dare to risk <i>that</i>. Additionally her plan regarding the Kisses had been put into action, and results should be visible in one to two months. The Elder was quite confident that everything would go her way, and what little resistance the other Elders would offer would be swept away by Dou Ve and their fellowship on the Council.</p><p><b></b>Saotome Ranma (in both forms) was now an official ally of the Joketsuzoku, and as such entitled to learn any technique the Joketsuzoku deemed him/her worthy of. Thus Cologne began to teach him a modified version of the Hiryu Shoten Ha. The matriarch knew from eye-witness accounts, that Ranma <i>had</i> already modified the Hiryu Shoten Ha in her battle with Saffron.</p><p><b></b>That in and on itself was already impressive, for it required massive concentration and mastery of ki and aura-manipulation. But what she had to show the cursed martial artist now would certainly be much to his liking. And thus Ranma learned, how to create a Hiryu Shoten Ha just by himself, without being dependent on the hot ki of an opponent. The basic method to create the Hiryu Shoten Ha was quite useless, if an opponent simply could not be angered enough to develop a hot aura, and therefore the use of the basic attack was limited.</p><p><b></b>The modified version of the Hiryu Shoten Ha did not have this weakness. All that needed to be done was to rapidly switch between a hot and a cold aura, while spiralling around your own axis. The only disadvantage was, that one could not rely on the ki of an opponent to literally use their own strength against them. In case of the revised version, the user had to resort to his or her own ki-reserves.</p><p><b></b>And only <i>very few</i> of the Joketsuzoku had ever managed this. Cologne was among them, but even she could not produce many of the deadly whirlwinds depending only on her own power. But in Ranma's case Cologne had no worries. From what she had read of Ranma in her last scan of his aura, his ki reserves had even deepened further compared to what they had been when the female Ranma had given a display of her powers.</p><p><b></b>Thus Cologne had simply showed Ranma how it was done, and unsurprisingly he had it down quite fast. What happened then was all the more surprising, however. For soon the area was swamped with tornados of all sizes as a Ranma, who was as merry as a lark, released countless revised versions of the Hiryu Shoten Ha.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nearly fell of her staff in a supreme face-fault, and she wondered once more just how much ki the young warrior had at his disposal. For she would have been out of the count after three of the monsters at best. And here was Ranma, who did it just like it was all child's play. The Elder nodded to herself. She had seen many clues, and now she knew that she had been right. Ranma <i>had</i> absorbed some of Saffron's powers in and after the battle. Or somehow copied them. There was no other explanation for this incredible increase in power. But how this had come to, she did not know. And she doubted that she ever would.</p><p><b></b>Then Ranma paused for a moment, nodded to himself and doused himself with the next convenient cold liquid, a bottle of water, in that case. Obviously Ranma wanted to know, if she'd be as good in firing off the revised Hiryu Shoten Ha.</p><p><b></b>Cologne had told Ranma before teaching him the revised version, that it would carry over to the female half without any problems. But Ranma apparently wanted to apply a field test. And again Ranma, now in female form, began to release the revised versions of her most deadly attack like there was no tomorrow. The ease with which she did it started to make even Cologne envious.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly the Elder's eyes widened in amazement at the feat Ranma was now pulling off. Instead of releasing a 'normal' revised version of the Hiryu Shoten Ha Ranma had obviously decided to spice it up. "Hiryu Shoten Ha revised: Ice Tornado!" she yelled.</p><p><b></b>What was rushing at the trees a few hundred yards north of them was not the normal tornado the Hiryu Shoten Ha produced, but a whirlwind that seemed to consist of ice! Truly remarkable. <b>'Hmm, obviously Ranma has combined the revised Hiryu Shoten Ha with the Soul of Ice. Most intriguing.'</b> she thought, as she watched the icy whirlwind impact the trees. They were not only destroyed, but blown to icy splinters. In fact, this variant of the Hiryu Shoten Ha was a revised version of the one Ranma had used to kill Saffron, with the one difference, that she didn't depend on the hot ki of an opponent any more.</p><p><b>'And most potent.'</b> the Matriarch added as an afterthought, and Kasumi-otoko, who was standing some feet away from her, had eyes the size of dinner-plates, his exercises long forgotten. Sure, he had seen Ranma release a Hiryu Shoten Ha on occasion, but that here was really something else. And what was she doing <i>now</i>?</p><p><b></b>Cologne noticed it too. Ranma seemed to concentrate intently for several moments, and she glowed briefly in a fiery hue, before she released another, equally large tornado. "Hiryu Shoten Ha revised: Flaming Inferno!"</p><p><b></b>It was as large as its predecessor. Only that this tornado did not consist of ice. Instead, this one was literally made of flames! Needless to say that this tornado consumed another good portion of the poor trees, which were rapidly burned down to ashes.</p><p><b></b>Moments later Ranma emerged from her concentrated state, and she took in the image of the devastation she had wrecked for the first time. And to say that she was shocked by what she saw would be an understatement. The Hiryu Shoten Ha in its normal form had been her most deadly attack even though it had been based on her enemies' strength, but these two attacks outclassed it completely. And in contrast to the original Hiryu Shoten Ha these attacks were based on her own power, her own ki. Fact that frightened her somewhat.</p><p><b></b>She silently vowed to herself, that she would only use them in a life-or-death situation. There was no room to use those monsters against her normal opponents. None of them would survive, that Ranma was sure of. Those attacks were a last resort, and from now on they would be her own set of Saotome sealed techniques. They were just too dangerous and made the vacuum blades of her father look pale in comparison.</p><p><b></b>"What... what in Kami-samas name was <i>that</i>?" Kasumi-otoko finally asked, breaking the silence that had descended upon the plain like a blanket after this demonstration of destructive power.</p><p><b></b>"Something <i>really</i> deadly." Ranma answered, "Something I swear I'll only use if I have no other choice. I'll never take a life needlessly, and by using these attacks it could happen. Easily. I don't want that." she ended, mumbling. Ranma was deeply unsettled by the destructive power she possessed, and she was involuntarily reminded of how she had had to kill Saffron with her revised and most deadly revised version of the Hiryu Shoten Ha. Those were no pleasant memories, and she felt herself getting depressed.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded to herself, a satisfied expression on her face. She had been deeply unsettled by the destructive power she had witnessed here and now. The Elder had seen a lot in her 300 years, but those attacks were of a destructive power she had not seen in a long time. It was a good thing that so much power was in the hands of a person with a conscience. The matriarch shuddered as she imagined her rival Bii Da with that kind of power. The world would surely be a darker, <i>much</i> darker place in a case like that. Only good that this irritant was forever out of her hair.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko sensed Ranmas need to be comforted, and hugged her softly from behind, this time holding <i>her</i> tight and secure in <i>his</i> strong arms. And seconds later Ranma leant into the embrace, ready to take the comfort Kasumi-otoko was giving her. In the past months Kasumi had always been there for her, and had given her the emotional support and strength she had needed. And due to that Ranma trusted Kasumi very much. Kasumi had offered her unconditional friendship and trust, something she had not experienced in a very long time. And from there it had grown into more.</p><p><b></b>That she was currently in female form, and that she was leaning into a male Kasumi at present didn't bother her much. Not any more, ever since she had found out, that every human being needed and deserved a source of comfort, something she had never known and experienced with baka oyaji before. And now she needed comfort. Besides, it was still easier to express her emotions as a female, and she was still regretting what she had been forced to do at Jusendo. Sometimes she had still nightmares about it.</p><p><b></b>But as a female she could let it out so much better, she could talk about things and feelings she never would have talked about in her male form, and she knew that Kasumi would understand her. The comfort she had given her after their talk about the happenings at Jusendo had been one of the greatest experiences of her life. She, now he, had held and comforted her. Thus she leant backwards and simply enjoyed the comforting feeling the embrace gave her. She was rapidly appreciating a feeling she had missed out her whole life: the feeling of safety.</p><p><b></b>Grinning to herself, Cologne decided to give those two some time for themselves. It looked as if things could be progressing between the two. Maybe she would not have to bop them over the head after all. "Children, I need to go over to my tent to fetch a scroll. It might take some minutes to find it, though." she said and pogoed off on her stick.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko and Ranma only nodded absently. A moment later Ranma sighed. "Kasumi, I don't want to have to kill some one again. Saffron was bad enough, and <i>he</i> had the ability to regenerate. Others won't come back. I really don't want to think about what could happen if I used those attacks. And who knows, maybe I'll be forced ta use ´em in a future fight!"</p><p><b></b>The other cursed individual tightened his hold from behind, and Ranma instinctively snuggled into his broad chest. "Don't fear, my Ranma-chan. You are a good person, and you'd never kill anyone if there was any other way. You told me all about your fight with Saffron. From what you said, he left you no other choice but to kill him. You had to sacrifice a life in order to save many others, my sister the foremost. Ranma-chan, you <i>saved</i> Akane and all the others by doing what you did. They would be dead if you had not! And I am extremely thankful for what you did. Killing is not right, but sometimes, in order to prevent a greater evil, it is necessary. You <i>did</i> what was necessary, Ranma-chan, and that you feel remorse about it shows what a good and caring person you are." he ended with the breast-note of confirmedness. <b>'A good and caring person I love.'</b> he added mentally.</p><p><b></b>For several seconds Ranma did not reply, as she thought over what Kasumi-otoko had said. Then she nodded. "I have to thank you too, Kasumi. For your kind words and for comforting me back then and now. And... for so much else. I really like you, and that you said what you said just now really, really means a lot to me. Thank you." she said with conviction.</p><p><b></b>Ranma twisted her neck and looked up at Kasumi-otoko. His eyes were glinting with happiness. "I have to thank <i>you</i> for taking me on this trip. I am beginning to find myself, and I realise just how limited I have been before, what I had given up. And martial arts really is fun! What Cologne has showed me is really to my liking, and I'd like it if you could show me some moves after we'll move on to your friend. Primarily I want to learn healing techniques, but I also want to be able to defend myself well enough so that I can either get away or hold my own until help arrives. I never want to experience a repeat of what Kodachi did to me." he said with conviction.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded happily. "Of course I'll teach you, Kasumi. Umm, do you mind if I call you Yoshiro when you're male? It gets kinda irritating to call ya Kasumi when you're male."</p><p><b></b>Now it was Kasumi-otokos turn to nod. "It's okay. But only if I can call you Ránmā when you're female." he teased.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed. "Okay, it's only fair. And I like you too, Kasumi. I really do."</p><p><b></b>Obviously the emotions in her voice had carried over, for Kasumi-otoko spun Ranma slowly around with the intention to hug her. When their eyes locked, they both felt an intense spark course through their bodies. And <i>this</i> time, each cursed individual began to act upon it.</p><p><b></b>One further look at each other, and their lips locked in a passionate kiss. And unlike the first time that she had been kissed by a guy (she still remembered the kiss Mikado Sanzenin had stolen from her with a righteous fury) she enjoyed it, for she knew, that the person that kissed her was Kasumi. But talk about raging and obviously still balancing male hormones here...</p><p><b></b>What followed could only be described as a heavy snogging session. Both had been shocked at first when they had separated after the initial kiss, but the shock was quickly overcome when they both noticed that they had enjoyed it very much. To word it appropriately: their inhibitions were overcome in favour of the passion. And his still balancing male hormones made Kasumi-otoko act a lot more forward than usual.</p><p><b></b>They were however coherent enough not to go any further than just kissing and caressing, for the strong sense of honour inherent to both Ranma and Kasumi-otoko kept it from going any further than a heavy make-out session. But it was clear that the dynamics of their relationship were about to change from a budding relationship to a more serious one.</p><p><b></b>After catching their breaths and gathering their bearings both decided to talk about their feelings while Cologne was still absent. At first Ranma was quite flattened at what had transpired. "Man, I can't believe that I did... <i>that</i> with a guy. My first <i>real</i> kiss, and it was a guy. Even if it's you, Kasumi. But I have to say, I really enjoyed it, because it was <i>you</i>. It felt <i>good</i>. Though I still have the feeling that we were doing something perverted." Ranma said.</p><p><b></b>Due to all that had happened in the last few minutes she had forgotten that she wanted to call Kasumi-otoko Yoshiro. But the other cursed individual didn't seem to mind, and it was more than likely that it had also escaped his mind. Kasumi-otoko sighed. What had Akane done? If Ranma ever decided to sue Akane for psychological damage his little sister was sure to become a pauper.</p><p><b></b>He took a deep breath and sighed. "No, Ranma-chan, we were <i>not</i> doing anything perverted. What we did was normal, normal for a man and a woman attracted to each other. That we are in our cursed forms does not matter in this case. It is normal that men and women, who are attracted to each other do what we did. And I <i>have</i> feelings for you, and I am very much attracted to you, Ranma." There, he had said it.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked surprised for a moment, but the surprise was short-lived. Then she began to talk about what was on <i>her</i> mind. "Let me tell you something. You know, over the last four months I have come to know you a lot better. You taught me, you helped me, and you never wanted anything in return. You never clobbered or malleted me, never insulted or blamed me. Instead, you were caring, understanding, gentle, supportive and all around nice to me. At first, after I arrived and for quite some time, I thought of you as a surrogate mother or an older sister. But this image began to change in the last four months. Completely."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko barely dared to hope. The prior display of emotions had been quite intense during their make-out session, but it could all have been a spur of the moment thing. Was Ranma now really saying what he hoped she was? Could he dare to hope?</p><p><b></b>With a smile Ranma gave the answer. "I began to develop other feelings for you, Kasumi. You know how hard it is for me ta talk 'bout me feelings 'n stuff." she said, and Kasumi-otoko noticed that Ranma was slipping into slang once more, a habit that obviously came to life when she was under stress, "Its somewhat easier in this form, but its still hard. But I'll try me best." she said with a smile. "I noticed it first during the talk after Akane had smashed me through the bed. Ya were so nice 'n caring 'n understanding, so very much unlike Akane. Ya tried everything ta help ta bring me 'n Akane together. Ya often took my side during this time, and after ya got cursed my feelings got even stronger. Ya, remember the incident in the kitchen, doncha?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded and blushed in remembrance. Though it was nothing compared to what they had done some minutes ago. "Yes, Ranma-chan. I do, and I felt the same. I still do."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled a dazzling smile and continued. Not being called a pervert once in all the time, or not being malleted constantly gave her the poise to talk about her emotions without choking up or denying them like she would have done normally. With Akane. But this was Kasumi, a person she was growing to love. Rapidly. "Ever from then on till now my feelings for ya have grown stronger, Kasumi. I like ya. I really like ya."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled back. Even though she had not been able to say it in male form, Kasumi had understood what Ranma meant. Ranma <i>loved</i> him/her, but it was still easier to express her feelings when a girl. Curse Genma Saotome for mentally and socially crippling his child! Sure, she had been able to remedy and correct a lot in those nearly four months, but there was still a lot of work left. Work that Kasumi would gladly take on.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's ability to express himself and his feelings had improved, but it was still easier for him to do so in female form. <i>Much</i> easier. That was probably also, why Ranma had admitted that she liked him. Such admissions were apparently much easier for her in female form, as she had always been taught that Ranma had to keep his emotions down as to not show any weakness.</p><p><b></b>Through constantly suppressing them Ranma had become unable to show or even talk about emotions, although this had improved ever since Nodoka had really started to be there for Ranma after the failed wedding. But the male Ranma still had a long way to go, and Kasumi hoped that what Ranma learned and would learn would carry over to the male half too.</p><p><b></b>With his teachings Genma Saotome had robbed the male Ranma off of the ability to express his feelings. They had literally been buried, and only slowly, ever so slowly the male Ranma learned to express his feelings. That it was so much easier for Ranma had everything to do with the different emotional make-up and the hormones of a girl, which became more prominent now that Ranma wasn't fighting the curse so much any more.</p><p><b></b>And Kasumi was quite glad that Ranma had been able to express herself this much. He had to admit that he had been surprised, when Ranma had accepted his silent offer to comfort her. Surprised and pleased, as it showed how much Ranma trusted him/her.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma reflected onto how their relationship had grown up to this point. All the time Kasumi had encouraged her/him to talk to her about his/her feelings, and she had listened patiently and given advice, training and comfort.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled to himself. The cursed martial artist had learned fast to accept his/her opinion as something really worth to be considered, and that he trusted her surely did help. Ranma had needed a person to trust, and he/she had been this person. In return Kasumi had trusted Ranma, even though he only had seemed to see it lately. That Ranma had now been able to say that she liked him/her and maybe even loved him/her meant much. Really much.</p><p><b></b>He reached out and stroked her silky red hair softly, and surprisingly Ranma did not flinch back but leant into the touch, obviously enjoying it. "Then it is time to confess my sins, as they say, Ranma-chan. Ever since I started to train you in becoming better regarding social behaviour and language skills and school stuff I came to know you better and better. From our talks I learned a lot about you, and I slowly began to fall in love with you. Yes, Ranma-chan," Kasumi-otoko said to the astonished looking Ranma, "if you didn't guess from our... what do they call it? Oh ye<b>s</b>, make out session: I do love you. At first I did not act upon it, because I thought you and my little sister still had a chance to find happiness together. But after what little sis did, and the consequences it caused I decided to not hold back any more."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled after she had gathered her bearings once more. "I am glad you decided that." she said, leaning into the stroking hand once more to emphasise her point. It felt so good to be comforted in this way that she simply ignored the voices in her mind that said that a true martial artist needed no one but him or herself.</p><p><b></b>Her fathers´ stupid teachings could go and screw themselves for all she cared. And as for being manly, slowly she really began to leave being always manly behind her. Here, without the stupid panda or anyone else on her case, she could simply be the <i>person</i> Ranma. A person, who happened to be female at the moment. And a person, who enjoyed being fondled. In light of this, her father's teachings could all dry up and die for all she cared. They were worthless anyway.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled pleased. "After I received my curse you were there for me. You helped me through this hard time, and it is because of you that I have begun to accept the curse. Hey, listen to me! Because of you I started talking like a man. And do you know what? It doesn't bother me that much. I love you in both forms, Ranma Saotome, and it does not matter which form you wear. It is not the <i>body</i> that is important, but the <i>person inside</i>. And I happen to love this person. I will however not ask you to marry me, for I know how much you hated to be forced into a marriage with Akane by 'uncle' and my father." he said.</p><p><b>'Although I would not mind <i>if</i> you asked.'</b> he added as an afterthought. "I have no intention to be like the other women in your life, and I will <i>never</i> become like them, not only because of the curse." he said half in jest. "Women like Kodachi, Shampoo, Ukyo and even my little sister took you as granted, and they fought over you as if you were a possession or a prise to be won at a carnival. How I hated that! No, Ranma, I will and would never make you do something you would not want. If you, however, would consider marrying me some time in the future, you'd make me the luckiest wife... and husband" he added as an afterthought, "on this planet. Ranma, I love you, and that very much. And because I do I want to do everything to make you happy. After all, you most of all deserve happiness." he said with conviction.</p><p><b></b>Ranmas smile could have lit up a black hole. "I like ya too. Very much so. And I'm sure, one day I'll ask ya. Just be patient with me." she said and sighed. She had <i>nearly</i> been able to say it this time. "And I see whatcha mean with the person inside. Know what?" she asked, and Kasumi-otoko shook his head. Ranma grinned. "My girl side likes your boy-side as much as my boy-side your girl-side. I finally begin to understand that my forms are two sides of the same coin and nothing separate. Thank you for helping me realising this." she said and placed a passionate kiss on Kasumi-otokos mouth.</p><p><b></b>Had someone told her some months ago, that she would be as good as indifferent to making out in her girl-form, she'd probably declared the person more insane than the Kunos. But now that Kasumi was in the same situation as her, only in reverse, it did not matter that much any more. As a guy she liked Kasumi´s girl form, and as a girl her guy form. Now where was the problem with this? I would be downright idiotic to turn off her feelings just because she happened to be a girl at any given moment. Also, it was still Kasumi, in both forms. A Kasumi she had really come to like over the last months and whom she now started to love.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi was right. It wasn't the body that mattered, but the person inside.. And although Ranma could not admit out loud yet, that he/she loved Kasumi, the other cursed individual knew. That she was sure of, and that was all that mattered for now. Both Ranma and Kasumi agreed that they would explore their feelings further, and both had enjoyed their 'making out' very much. And both were glad at what they had found together.</p><p><b></b>All it had taken for Kasumi had been to be there for Ranma, to be a friend in a rough and hostile environment. To offer the cursed individual a secure harbour, a shelter from the storm his/her life in Nerima had been. Two lonely souls had finally found together. And it was good, for it felt <i>right</i>, and that in both of their forms.</p><p><b></b>Both also agreed that they would discover their feelings rather in their birthforms in the beginning, despite that both knew that it was the same person inside regardless the form, but it still felt somewhat awkward to kiss the living daylights out of each other in their cursed forms. But both Kasumi and Ranma agreed also, that they would continue to discover their feelings even after they would lock themselves. Neither of them wanted to miss out these fantastic snogging sessions, so much was for sure. And both were sure that they would also get used to making out in their cursed forms over time.</p><p><b></b>In the background, unseen by Ranma and Kasumi, an old Amazon matriarch smiled. It was not a nice sight, but Cologne of the Joketsuzoku was glad for those two. She had already cut her losses, and she had turned the situation to her advantage (somewhat at least). Now, when Ranma and Kasumi would return to Nerima, she'd still have the joyous task to tell her 'kitten' of her decision and plans regarding Ranma. Talk about cat-astrophe...</p><p><b></b>After politely coughing and enjoying the flaring blushes of the younglings, Cologne smiled at the two young cursed individuals. Lesser persons would probably have done the sensible thing at the sight of this smile: run away. "Children, I'd say after the exhausting activities of the day it is now time to take a break and eat some lunch." she said in a tone that made clear, that it was more than a suggestion. Their sensei had spoken, and Kasumi and Ranma obeyed.</p><p><b></b>Moments later Ranma and Kasumi-otoko were preparing lunch from the supplies Cologne had brought with her in her stuff space from the Nekohanten, while Cologne used her supplies to create a sauce. Not long after that the three were enjoying a quiet meal consisting of rice (mountains of that for Ranma), fish and some vegetables. And a 'hot' Chinese sauce.</p><p><b></b>After the lunch had been consumed, meaning, after Ranma was filled, Cologne decided to broach a rather sensible topic. "Ranma, what I have to say now might make you two quite angry. But please listen to me and let me tell you what I found out."</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko looked at each other for a moment, and quite puzzled at that. Then both nodded towards each other and then towards Cologne. "Okay." they said in stereo.</p><p><b></b>The Elder gathered her bearings and began to explain. "Surely you two noticed that Tendo Akane acted more and more violent over the last months." she said, and both curse victims nodded. "After what happened when you received your curse, Tendo Kasumi, I decided to check my spice rack. You two don't know it, but after the wedding disaster I had forbidden my great-granddaughter explicitly to use any of my spices, herbs or aphrodisiacs. Any of the tricks, that might be considered underhanded were forbidden to her, as I had decided I had helped her enough already. Every warrior of my tribe had to win her Airen just by herself, without any help from the tribe, and it has been this way for generations. In coming to Japan and helping her, I undertook actions which might be considered questionable. And after I came to know, how immature my great-granddaughter had acted at the wedding, I forsake her any help. From then on she was on her own in her quest to win you, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girl nodded. "I asked myself why you suddenly had stopped to interfere just like that. I mean, come on, before you used every trick in your book to make me Shampoo's husband, and suddenly you just stopped completely. At first I did not trust the peace and quiet and thought you were up to something big. Well, peace and quiet aside from the odd glomp or ramen delivery. But what has Shampoo to do with Akane's behaviour if she could not use any of your tricks, Cologne?"</p><p><b></b>Cologne made a face. "It seems as if my great-granddaughter had already secured some of my more potent poisons. I found out when I made my stocktaking that a good dose of fèi zēng jìn dú pǐn¹ poison was missing. It is a quite potent and non-deadly poison that serves to increase negative emotions. Originally it was used in my tribe to turn our warriors into fighting machines before a very decisive battle, and I kept a batch here for security reasons. But I swear on my honour as the leader of the Joketsuzoku that I had no knowledge that Shampoo had used it."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded to herself. She could very well imagine for which security reasons. Should she have ever accepted a challenge from Shampoo, or should she have proven to be too dangerous to bring into the tribe, that stuff might have been used against her. The Saotome girl shuddered to herself when she imagined a pumped-up Cologne. "So that is why she acted this way. Akane already mistrusted me and was jealous of my abilities, but normally that would have been outbalanced by her affections towards me. But because her anger and jealousy were increased I always got the brunt of her negative emotions until it all boiled over." she said and nodded to herself.</p><p><b></b>Now it made sense, Ranma thought. She did not notice Kasumi's troubled expression, for said woman-turned-man feared, that his love might now decide to give Akane a second chance. Thus he waited with bated breath what the outcome would be, and quite literally for the other shoe to drop.</p><p><b></b>Cologne, on her part, had nodded. "Correct, Ranma. And it is quite easy to poison the target, as the poison can be applied to the tip of an arrow, which can then be fired using a blowtube. My guess is that this is how it happened. As to when it happened, my guess in that regard is, that my great-granddaughter did it some time after the failed wedding. She probably passed up Akane when the Tendo girl was alone. Shampoo is trained well enough to remain undetected by Akane, and the sting of the arrow, which is tiny, will not have hurt more than the sting of a mosquito. It is quite probable that Shampoo also got hand on one of our special miniature arrows which break down into their components and are absorbed by the victim. But don't worry, they're completely biological and won't have harmed Tendo Akane any further. Quite clever of my great-granddaughter, I have to admit. But I can assure you that she will be punished. She acted against the explicit wishes of her superior, namely me, and this will have consequences."</p><p><b></b>The red-haired Saotome girl looked quite angry, but also thoughtful. She had watched Cologne like a hawk when she had told them what she had found out, and if Ranma was a master at one thing, then at reading people. Ranma was quite sure that not even the Elder could fool her, and she was convinced that Cologne had told the truth. "I can not deny, that I am very indignant because of what Shampoo did. I always hated it, when you two used your underhanded tricks, but I believe you when you say that you didn't know. It only saddens me for Akane. I believe she really loved me, but due to what Shampoo did my love to her is dead. Even if her emotions were intensified, it remains that she was angry and mistrustful towards me. She always said that I was a pervert, although I had no idea there and then what she meant. Now that mom has told me the facts of life I can understand where she is coming from, but that makes it even more unfair and hurtful." she said sadly.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko had slowly released the breath he had been holding and skidded closer to Ranma. Then he leant her towards him, and her head leant against his side. "I know, Ranma-chan. My sister had absolutely no right to say these things to you. They were and are unfounded and wrong. If she has not changed her attitude once we return, I will show her that she can not treat the person I love in this way. I will not tolerate it. You are no pervert, but the most wonderful person I have ever met. And I am glad that I have you."</p><p><b></b>It was clear that Ranma was deeply moved by what Kasumi-otoko had said. She was still unused to receive positive feelings, but as she knew that Kasumi was the most trust-deserving person she knew that he meant what he had said. "Thank you." she simply said and leant closer into him.</p><p><b></b>Now she knew what she had missed all the time. Someone, in whose presence she could relax and simply be herself, someone who was a safe harbour to her and in whose presence she could feel safe. Someone in whose presence she did not have to wear the mask of the macho and uncaring guy. Unconsciously she knew that it was much easier for her to relax and give in to those feelings while she was female, but it was a start. She'd need quite some time until she would be able to trust others and be so easy-going like before her experiences that followed Jusenkyo, but with Kasumi's help she was sure that she would manage.</p><p><b></b>It was a great feeling to be loved, and she knew that Kasumi loved her unconditionally, and that in both forms, as far as she could tell. That was also another factor. She doubted that Akane would ever have gotten used to her other form, and most probably she would have forced her to change back immediately whenever she'd have changed forms in case they would have been married.</p><p><b></b>This way she would never have had the chance to get used to her curse, for she doubted that Akane would have stopped calling her a pervert only because the curse was with her for the rest of her life. No, it was probably for the better that the Fates had decided to throw her together with Kasumi Tendo instead of Akane Tendo. She inwardly had to snicker at the thought that now, that they were both cursed with opposite curses they would indeed be the ideal couple in both forms.</p><p><b></b>While she had hung to her own thoughts, Kasumi-otoko had begun to stroke her hair, and now that she noticed it consciously she leant into the touch to enjoy it to the fullest. Over the course of the last few days she had come to know that there existed something else in the area of physical contact but clobberings and malletings. As much as she had been mistreated by Akane she had nearly forgotten that positive forms of physical contact existed. Needless to say that she liked the change very much. This was something she could get used to easily.</p><p><b></b>She suppressed a contented sigh and looked at Cologne from her position. Ranma noticed that the Elder was wearing a knowing smile. "Hey Cologne, any idea how long this poison stuff will last? I mean, it would not be good if Akane started throwing tantrums against my mother and her sister. Pop don't concern me too much, he deserves it."</p><p><b></b>Cologne made a thoughtful face. "This particular batch of Fèi zēng jìn dú pǐn is very potent and long lasting. Its effects carry on for at least four to five months, and I estimate that three months are over at best. It would be helpful if someone got her to a doctor. Maybe even one of your… how do you call them again? Ah yes, shrinks, I suppose. Yes, maybe even a shrink could be of help. What Tendo Akane needs now are calming drugs that counter the influence of the Fèi zēng jìn dú pǐn. Honestly, I wonder how the child was able to attend school without destroying it. I will see to it personally that she will receive what she will need. And I will see to it that Shampoo will get punished."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. That satisfied him. It was only too bad that they had no way of contacting his home, as this would have enabled him to help his sister faster. But he'd trust Cologne. As far as he knew, and from what Ranma had told him, the Elder had always kept her word in important matters just like this. "That would be good, Cologne." he finally said. "And I can tell you how she was able to go to school without demolishing anything aside from my love here. Ever since she started acting angrier than usual I spiked her morning tea with calming herbs. I did not think much of it, for she had had such a phase already when our mother had died. It did not help that much, but enough so that I thought she was only going through a phase. And when it still remained the same I began using stronger herbs, until I told father of it. But he only said that his little baby girl was just upset at Ranma for doing this or that, and that it would pass. We all know the end result."</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded. "That we do, Tendo Kasumi. I can only say that I am sorry for what happened, but at least some good came out of it." she said with a wink and a smirk at the two, who blushed nicely. Then Cologne sobered up. "But I will have to punish my great-granddaughter for acting against my will."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked thoughtful and apprehensive. "But don't lock her as a cat or something like that. What she did is hard to forgive, but I can nearly understand her. She acted out of love, and love often makes blind." Then she snatched her fingers and a devilish gleam appeared in her eyes. "I know what could be part of the punishment. Part one could be that you make her research cures for the Neko-ken. That would be reparation towards me for her interference. Part two could be, that she has to admit that she was the one who set Akane up. You could also make her formally apologise to Akane, plus make her find a way to help Akane deal with her temper. And, to top it, she has to go on a date with Mousse!" she finished smirking.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko fell over laughing at the last part, as he knew all too well that Shampoo did not have one fibre in her body that held positive feelings for the Yaazuniichuan cursed boy. Cologne for her part thought through what Ranma had suggested. Finally she nodded. "Those are good ideas, Ranma. They will have to be refined to approach Amazon standard, but they are an adequate working basis. And I promise that I will not lock her in her cursed form. In our tribe this is the worst form of punishment for failure, to be locked in cursed form until the one afflicted with the punishment loses the will to live. I admit that I am very glad that my great-granddaughter will not face this fate once we return to our village."</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girl and the brown-haired man nodded. "I too am happy that Shampoo can return to the tribe with her honour intact. Even though she does not know it yet." Ranma said.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded while she surveyed the cursed individuals. Some minutes ago they had changed positions and where now sitting side by side, holding hands. Their relationship seemed indeed to be taking the step from a mere budding relationship that it had been throughout the last days to a more serious relationship. And as she checked the auras of Ranma and Kasumi-otoko she also knew why this was happening so fast.</p><p><b></b>Gauging from their auras Cologne could tell, that Ranma and Kasumi were very compatible. In fact, had Ranma not had his curse when he had arrived at the Tendo Dojo the Elder doubted that Kasumi would have refused an engagement to Ranma. Most probably those two would have been a married couple by now already had that been the case. But it could not be denied that they were making fast progress in their relationship, which even pleased the Elder. After all, a happy ally was a good ally.</p><p><b></b>The Elder let those two cuddle some more minutes before she called off the break. Then she proceeded to teach Ranma some other Amazon techniques she deemed necessary while she instructed Kasumi at the same time. The Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku still had the one or the other ace up her sleeve, and Ranma watched, learned and got the techniques down like she always did. In a moments notice.</p><p><b></b>And while Ranma practised, Cologne continued to teach an equally motivated Kasumi-otoko some more martial arts. But soon it would be time for Cologne to return to the Nekohanten. It was not wise to give Shampoo or Mousse any leeway, and their task should nearly be complete by tomorrow.</p><p><b></b>Later that evening Cologne and the two cursed individuals were sitting together at a comfy campfire. Ranma and Kasumi, who had changed back to their birth forms after the end of the days training, had long since given up any pretence when in Cologne's presence. Kasumi was presently snuggled up to Ranma's broad chest this time, and now it was Ranma's turn to softly stroke Kasumi's hair. The oldest Tendo daughter obviously enjoyed it very much, and she had her eyes closed. Kisses and caresses were exchanged from time to time, and both had the satisfied smile of lovers on their faces.</p><p><b></b>Cologne smiled to herself. Ah, young love. To be young once more. Now she knew more than ever that she had done that right thing. Ranma was now on a good way to find happiness, something they had denied the Saotome child for so long. After this had become clear to her and her realisation that Ranma could not be brought into the tribe as anything but an ally she had more than ever come to rethink the outsider rules.</p><p><b></b>She was now convinced that she could revoke the outsider rules with the help of her friends on the council, and ever since she had deemed this necessary for the survival of the tribe she had carefully worked in this direction. But to be honest, Cologne had been surprised that Ranma had not demanded anything in this direction. Maybe the young warrior had been too surprised by this gift horse, and Cologne could understand Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Only after she herself had seen vis a vis what the outsider rules did to the potential airen she had realised that the times of old were now finally over. The planet was populated by more than six billion people, and due to the modern means of transportation it could not be ruled out that their village was found by adventurers. And it was simply impossible to declare anyone who won against one of their warriors an airen.</p><p><b></b>The repercussions of this would simply be too great and could very well result in severe diplomatic problems. It had only been their luck back then that the Saotomes had been wanted for questioning by the authorities, otherwise they could have made their pursuit of Ranma a lot more difficult. And the tribe could still not risk to get into an open conflict with the other members of the Chinese government, nor would they ever be able to. In order to survive they had to keep a low profile even on the government, and therefore the outsider rules had to revoked.</p><p><b></b>The Elder was brought out of her musings by Ranma, who had apparently tried to get her attention. Pretending to stare into the flames she slowly allowed Ranma to get her attention and turned around. "Yes, child?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma scratched the back of his head with his right hand before answering. "Err… ya know, Cologne, I don't wanna seem unthankful or anything, and it's really great to be free of the kisses… but what about the other poor guys who're gonna be trapped because of your outsider rules? I mean, I'm now somewhat a part of the tribe too, and I don't like those stupid laws one bit! Ya know, the council can only call me for help if they're attacked, but what happens if someone attacks the tribe who has been afflicted by the outsider rules? Someone who has lost his wife or another loved one and who wants revenge? Ain't there some way to change the outsider rules, or better, can they be cancelled?"</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded sagely instead of protesting, like Ranma and Kasumi would have expected. "Before I answer this, allow me a question. Why did you accept the cancelling of the kisses although you knew, that as our ally you would have to accept our rules?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth looked chagrined. "To be honest, this offer was too good to be refused. Ya know, I was really fed up what with the kisses. I really hated how Shampoo always threw herself at me, I hated her stupid glomps, and I hated the whole stupid chase that started because I knocked her out by accident. To be honest, I hate your stupid laws regarding the kisses most of all. When you offered me to end all this I jumped at the offer without thinking twice. Only after I had signed the contract and everything had settled down I began to think. That's why I asked."</p><p><b></b>The Matriarch nodded. She had expected this answer. "I know that will come as a surprise, but I see our outsider rules as something outdated and overcome myself. In light of the development of the modern civilisation we can not afford to live like savages any more. And the Kisses, especially the Kiss of Death could cause my tribe great harm in the future if we continued the politic to kill any outsider woman who manages to defeat one of or warriors. The prime example for this was the fight between yourself in your female form and my Shampoo. In hindsight I must say that the Kiss of Death was not justified, as no specific challenge for an honour-fight had been issued. The fight you fought concerned the food your stupid panda of a father had eaten, nothing else. But I digress. I myself plan to revoke both the Kiss of Death and Marriage. They may have served us well in the past, but are more than overcome now. You may not believe it, but I actually try to change these particular rules for a long time. But in the past I have always been thwarted by my former substitute Bii Da. Now that she has been removed from the picture the way is clear for some long overdue reforms."</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed youth sat there slack-jawed, and Kasumi was not much better off. Cologne had practically admitted that the Kiss of Death had been unjustified! And she herself wanted to change the Outsider rules. Now talk about really unexpected! But the best surprises were the pleasant ones. "Err… wow." was the intelligible reply of Ranma. Then, when he had gathered his bearings again he grew agitated. "You really wanna revoke the Kisses?" he asked, and Cologne nodded. "Can I have that in writing?"</p><p><b></b>The Elder actually grinned. Ranma had matured very much due to the influence of Kasumi, and it had done him a world of good in many regards. "I can give you something better. I, Cologne, Head Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku Amazons promise Saotome Ranma, ally of the tribe of the Joketsuzoku Amazons, on my word of honour as an Elder to revoke the Kisses of Marriage and Death. Acting witness of this is for now and evermore Tendo Kasumi." she declared formally. "You know that the word of honour means everything to an Elder, don't you?"</p><p><b></b>Both youths nodded dumbfounded. They had expected a lot, but this adamant confirmation of her intentions from Cologne surprised them greatly. Obviously she really meant business, which was not that surprising after the fiasco she had witnessed regarding her great-granddaughter.</p><p><b></b>It was good to see that the Elder had finally given up the near obsessive hunt after Ranma, and the effects were much more positive than expected. For during the last days Cologne had acted really nicely. And said Elder could give them something as important as her word of honour with a light heart. She knew that the outsider rules would be revoked, it would only take a maximum of two months. Her lead would be followed, Dou Ve would assure this.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi looked at each other and nodded. "We do." they said in stereo."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi actually smiled. "It is good to hear that, Elder Cologne. We are really relieved that Ranma won't have to act against his conviction, and that is something which could happen should a scenario like Ranma described should occur. But how do you see the chances that the kisses will be dissolved in the near future?"</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist looked intently at Cologne. His Ka-chan had just asked the prise question. But Cologne smirked. "To be honest, very good. I have made preparations, and my substitute Dou Ve has begun to prepare the other members of the council for what I'm planning. By the time I'll act the resistance will be minimal. In one to two months you can expect the dissolvement of the kisses. From then on our warriors will have to travel the world to convince potential husbands of their worth. It is high time for a more thorough modernisation of my tribe, and its about to start. Actually you can be proud of yourself, Ranma, for you brought about these changes. Had you not proven to be such a hard and actually unbreakable nut we might have never changed our ways. And those who do not change will be crushed by the irresistible gears of time."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi and Ranma both smiled as they looked at each other. And another issue resolved. Grand! "Wow, old ghoul, that was deep. And I'm really glad ta hear that the kisses will be dissolved. That's great!" he exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>"Ranma! Language!" Kasumi chided, and instantly Ranma looked sheepish.</p><p><b></b>"Sorry, force of habit." he relented with a smile, which caused both women to laugh.</p><p><b></b>The three chatted a bit about what Cologne expected for the future of her tribe, and also about what the two youths thought about what the future would bring for them. All the while Ranma stroked the hair of Kasumi, who was leaning into Ranma with a content smile on her face. Then Cologne remembered something she had wanted to talk to Ranma about. "Ranma," she began, and the cursed individual stopped in his ministrations to look up at the Elder, "there is something I wanted to talk to you about. About how you became so powerful. I have a theory regarding that."</p><p><b></b>Now Ranma was all ears. Absently he continued to stroke Kasumi's hair, but his attention was now clearly on the Elder. Kasumi did not mind though, for she was interested in what Cologne had to say too. "Okay, Elder. Shoot." Ranma said.</p><p><b></b>Said Elder nodded. "My theory for your rather immense increase in power is, that you somehow absorbed a part of Saffron's powers in your fight with him. How that came about I do not know. But the evidence is clear. I saw it on several occasions in your aura. When you raised your true battle aura a few days back I noticed it for the first time. It had not only become much more powerful, but different. It is not only hot any more, but seems to consist of fire, the base of Saffrons' powers. Somehow you seem to have these powers now, too. And in addition to your already remarkable powers they have made you now stronger than even Saffron, if Mousse is to be believed. I advise you, Ranma, explore these new powers and train in them. You have them, to which extent I do not know. But knowing you, it's probably the full package. As I said, you have them, Ranma, so train in them and use them. It would be a waste if you did not."</p><p><b></b>To say that Ranma was baffled would be an understatement. "You... you mean ta say that I got me power-up from <i>Saffron</i>! Oh shit! What if that will make me go evil?"</p><p><b></b>Cologne cackled. "Then the world can say bai-bai." Seeing that Ranma was not amused Cologne chuckled and continued. "I was just joking. Another of the few sports an old woman has left."</p><p><b></b>Ranma raised a brow at that, and the Elder became serious again. "Believe me, Ranma, there is no danger from that. I examined your aura thoroughly enough to be sure of that. There is no trace of a possession or anything even remotely related. It has never been documented that the Phoenix King could do something like that, so no worries there. It is 'just' that you got powers like Saffron. And it would be wise to use them, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded. He <i>had</i> asked himself for quite some time now <i>why</i> he had become tougher and stronger ever since Jusendo. <i>That</i> explanation had not come to mind. But it made sense and alleviated his worries. And if Cologne was to be believed, and Ranma trusted her in matters like that, nothing bad would come of it. More the contrary, if he did it right, a lot of good could come from it. And he vowed that he would.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi on the other hand had hearts in her eyes. After all, <i>which</i> girl could claim that their boyfriend was as powerful (or even more) as a god? Once more pleased with her catch (not only for that reason, of course) Kasumi snuggled back into Ranma's chest.</p><p><b></b>The three remained seated around the campfire for quite some time and talked about all the world and his brother until they finally called it a night. Next morning the three got up early and dismantled their tents. Minutes later their backpacks were packed and shouldered. Cologne then handed the improved waterproof soap to Ranma, who stored it into his personal stuff-space.</p><p><b></b>Said stuff-space had increased dramatically due to his better mastering of the hidden weapons technique, a skill he had picked up from Mousse, and which had been refined now by Cologne. It was not enough to carry as many weapons as Mousse could, but Ranma had never intended it to be. The cursed martial artist was satisfied that he could now store more than just a bonbori (which he had snatched one time from Shampoo) and a spiked club (which he had snatched from Kodachi when the loon had once more attacked her).</p><p><b></b>Cologne also gave Ranma some scrolls she had taken with her from the Nekohanten. Knowing that Ranma would need all the advantages the cursed individual could get considering his/her chaotic life, she had made copies of some scrolls which would come in handy. She had even translated them into Japanese, and the Elder was very sure that Ranma would be able to learn those techniques just by him/herself. "I have the suspicion that you might need those techniques in the future, Ranma. Learn them well."</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned in answer as he browsed through the scrolls. Nice, very nice. Cologne was right, those could be of great use for him in the future. "Thank you, Cologne. I admit that I learned a lot, and it actually made fun. Ya can be quite cool if ya wanta, ya know that?" he said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>The Elder looked indignant for a moment, but it was easy to tell that it was faked. "An Amazon Elder is not 'cool'. That would not be dignified." she said in a mock-earnest tone. "But this one has to admit, it was nice teaching the two of you. I will stay in Nerima until you have returned and keep an eye on things."</p><p><b></b>Both cursed individuals nodded. It was good to know that Nerima was in good hands, even though it was very unexpected that those hands would be Colognes'. A few days ago they'd have anyone, who had told them that, hopelessly insane. But things changed.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi gave in to her feelings and actually hugged Cologne. The Elder was surprised for a moment, but then her tiny arms returned the hug. "It was a pleasure to be taught by you, Elder. I want to thank you for it, and everything you did for us. Ra-kun is right, you are 'cool'." she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>This time the Elder didn't protest, rather she returned the smile. "It was this ones pleasure too, Tendo Kasumi. Ranma, take good care of her. I wish you good luck, you two. Know that I am confident that you'll both find what you seek. And don't do anything I wouldn't do!" the old woman said cackling.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi face-faulted. Hard. Trust the old ghoul to say something like that. After they had gathered their bearings again they thanked Cologne, but the old Matriarch had one more thing to say. "Ranma, take this card. I'll need to know where I should send the waterproof soap to. With the supply you have now you will last one month. On this card is my e-mail-address, so it would be best if you could get access to a computer with internet access. And have no worries, no one beside me reads my e-mail."</p><p><b></b>Now both cursed martial artists were baffled. "You... you have an e-mail address?" asked Ranma incredulous as he took the card, which he pocketed in his wallet, which then disappeared into his stuff space again. He could read it later.</p><p><b></b>Cologne cackled. "What did you think, Ranma? This is the 21st century after all! Now good luck!"</p><p><b></b>After Ranma and Kasumi had recovered from the supreme face-fault, they gathered their bearings and hit the road. It had now been one week since they had left Nerima, and both asked themselves what had happened there in the meantime. Not that they did not enjoy their break from the craziness there, and the time they had spent together had been great, but to be honest, miss Nerima they did. But these thoughts were pushed aside as their new destination was now the Masaki house.</p><p><b></b>¹ means anger enhancing poison.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
