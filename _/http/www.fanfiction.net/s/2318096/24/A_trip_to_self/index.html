No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 24: Aftermath and Insights</b></p><p><b></b>What Ryoko had said got Ranma to her feet faster than even the promise of food could ever have. "WHAT? He's <i>not </i>dead? But… but…he had no pulse…or breathing… and he was so…so…cold!"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Ranma, that was probably just the shock from the wounds. Washu-chan is taking care of him and she is giving it her best." he said in a calm and pacifying voice and with more confidence than he truly felt. Like Ranma he could not feel an aura from Kasumi at the moment and he had no idea what it meant. "You can have complete faith in Washu, Ranma. If there's anyone that can help him then it's Washu."</p><p><b></b>Ranma however was not to be pacified. "I want to go to him! I want to see him!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto priest wanted to stop her but Ryoko knew what the other warrior was going through. With a nod at Ranma she teleported the two of them directly into the lab. When they reappeared Ranma knew instantly where they were and impulsively she hugged Ryoko. "Thank you!" she exclaimed and left a surprised Ryoko standing.</p><p><b></b>The redhead sprinted towards where she knew the medi-lab to be, a recovered Ryoko hot on her heels. The alien girl knew the safety procedures and she had to make sure that Red followed them before they entered the medi-lab. Thus she caught the other girl just in time to stop her. "Red, we need to put those suits on." she said and pointed to an array of protective clothing. "The medi-lab needs to remain sterile and Washu would kill us if we entered in our normal clothes."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded as she saw the need to do so. She practically teleported into a set of protective clothing and impatiently waited for Ryoko to finish. She could not enter the lab on her own as obviously some sort of security was active. "Do you know the code?" she asked her companion.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko shook her head. "Nope, but I can teleport us in now. Without the suits it just wasn't an option." she said, grabbed Ranma's hand and teleported them in.</p><p><b></b>What Ranma saw next nearly turned her stomach over. Her love was lying on a bio-bed that was now serving as an operation table and a lot of cables and tubes were attached to him. Washu had not noticed their arrival and was working frantically on her patient. The expression on her face did not raise her hopes.</p><p><b></b>Finally Ranma could not stand it any longer and made their presence known. "Washu-chan, how is he?" she asked without preamble.</p><p><b></b>Washu nearly dropped the med-scanner she had been holding and grabbed her heart. "Holy shit! Did you have to scare me shitless?" she exclaimed, breathed heavily, visibly catching herself.</p><p><b></b>"How is he?" Ranma urged again.</p><p><b></b>A professional mask appeared on Washu's face. "He's not so good at the moment. When he came in he had several broken ribs where the blast hit; in addition to that a rip had punctured his lung on the left side and he suffered second degree burns. Unsurprisingly he had massive internal bleeding and trauma." she listed, keeping the fact that he had been clinical dead upon his arrival from the other redhead.</p><p><b></b>Both Ranma and Ryoko had grimaced. The two of them had, unbeknownst to each other suffered from a lot of severe injuries throughout their lives and they knew that things were bad. Sensing that Ranma's emotional control was about to slip the ex-space pirate asked "And what's the good news?"</p><p><b></b>Washu managed a weak smile. "The good news as you so eloquently dubbed it is that I have stabilised him and he is still alive. But barely. The bad news is that he has lost a large amount of blood and I need to replace it; as you well know not even the regeneration-tank can't be of use in a case like this. To make matters worse I discovered in my examinations that his blood-type is very rare and I can't synthesise it on such a short notice. Normally I have a good supply of plasma at hand but after the last incidents I ran short and had no time to replace it. That's now coming back to haunt me. There's also no way to get his relatives who might have the same blood-type here in time. The normal way would take much too long and making a sub-space connection to their place is out of the question too; the calculations and preparations would just take too long." she said with a pout.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had a look of horror on her face. At first she had been overjoyed that her love was still alive but now he could still die because they had no blood available? That could not be! That must not be! "Washu-chan, please test my blood-type. If I can I'll donate as much as possible! I want him to live! I want to tell him that I love him!" she exclaimed with tears running down her face.</p><p><b></b>She did not care that she'd been taught to believe that crying was weak her whole life; all that she did care about was lying on this operation table... her Yoshiro, the one she loved more than life itself. All that prevented her from collapsing there and then was her iron will and hope.</p><p><b></b>The redheaded scientist nodded in understanding; she had already tried the blood-types of all member of this house and had drawn a blank each time. And the chances that Ranma had the same blood-type were slim but other miracles had happened before.</p><p><b></b>Before Ranma knew Washu had ordered her to take the protective suit off which the redhead had done all too gladly; then Washu-chan extracted a blood sample from her and began testing it. While she was doing this she muttered to herself. "A true miracle that he's still alive… even with my genius and my apparatuses… had he been a she, he would have been dead!"</p><p><b></b>That raised Ranma's brows into her hairline. Kasumi would have been dead if he had taken that blast as a female? Thank Kami-sama for the curse! But hadn't her love been cursed they'd never come here and nothing would have happened! Oh, that was all so darn confusing at the moment!</p><p><b></b>But one thing remained clear in her mind: her love had to survive! She wanted to say him how much she loved him, she wanted to have children with him and grow old with him. He just could not die! He must not die! Ranma could do little against the tears that were still streaming down her face and she was thankful as Ryoko laid a supporting hand on her shoulder.</p><p><b></b>Even warriors were allowed to cry and experience support when needed; that was what the gesture Ryoko made stated. For the first time in her life Ranma understood this and accepted the support and encouragement Ryoko gave her. It was a simple message: you're not alone in this. It was a damn good feeling.</p><p><b></b>But all the support in the world would do her no good if they didn't find a way to replace the blood her love had lost. Soon they'd know if the day would end in a miracle or a disaster…</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Finally the time of waiting was over. "I'll be!" Washu exclaimed. "You really <i>have</i> the same blood-type! Who would have thought that? Damn, the chances of winning in the lottery are higher than that! But it is true! I triple-checked and the two of you have both bloodtype 0 negative!" she exclaimed excited, only to become very thoughtful.</p><p><b></b>Then she shook her head. "I have to compare it to my scans of you two once this crisis is over but I could have sworn that you had a different bloodtype before… at least I'm sure it was different in your birthforms. But now you two have the same in your cursed forms. Could it be that your curses interacted on a molecular level which resulted in the same bloodtype in your cursed forms? Or did you always have this bloodtype and it only changed spontaneously in Kasumi just now? Bwahahahaha! And yet something more for the great Washu to uncover!" she exclaimed before sobering up again. "Ahem. This fortunate revelation will make it easy for you two to have children; at least in your cursed forms." she said with a cackle that made Ranma blush despite the serious situation. "And it will most assuredly save my patient. Although your blood, Ranma, has a strange factor in it which I can not determinate as of yet."</p><p><b></b>Inwardly Ranma jubilated but she still remained cautious. "Could it harm my love?"</p><p><b></b>Washu shook her head. "I'm 99 percent sure that it won't. Though I have no idea what it will do, if it will do anything at all; from my scans I know that it's dormant and the chance that it gets transferred are minimal. It's probably harmless anyway but we'll check on it later. First of all we have to save a patient! So take those stupid suits off so that we can do just that!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>"Hear, hear." Ryoko said and patted Ranma on the back. "See, Red, everything will turn out A-okay."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled at her fellow warrior and nodded while she got out of the suit and rolled up her sleeve once she was done. "Thanks, demon woman." she said softly.</p><p><b></b>"Anytime, freak." Ryoko countered playfully.</p><p><b></b>Washu on her part shook her head in something akin to mirth while she prepared everything for the blood donation. She readied another bio-bed and wheeled it beside her patient. The necessary preparations were soon made anda little while later blood was flowing from Ranma's veins into the veins of her love.</p><p><b></b>Although it hurt somewhat and was darn uncomfortable Ranma smiled for she knew that her blood would save her love. Little did she know that it would also have other effects…</p><p><b></b>Several hours later Ranma was still lying on the bio-bed, and due to her senses she could feel how the blood was flowing out of her. The receiving party was none other than the love of her life, a certain Kasumi Tendo, oldest child of one Soun Tendo.</p><p><b></b>She or rather he for Kasumi was at present locked in male form due to a special magical soap had nearly died when he had tried to save Ranma from an incoming energy blast fired by an evil Android. Inwardly Ranma asked herself why he had done it. The blast would have done much less damage on her. It just made no sense to her. "I don't understand it…" she muttered to herself. "Why did he do it?"</p><p><b></b>Ryoko who had returned to the lab some minutes prior and was sitting nearby to watch over her fellow warrior/rival picked up at this. "What do ya mean, Red?" the cyan-haired alien asked.</p><p><b></b>The redhead fixated her vision on the older girl. She had not realised that she had said that out loud but now it did not matter, did it? She could as well discuss it with someone who'd listen instead of the walls. "Kasumi, I mean. Why did he do it? Why did he jump in front of this blast when I had a much better chance to survive it? I just don't get it."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko smiled. Not her usual smirk but a genuine smile. Yes, apparently the two of them had a lot in common for Ranma seemed to be as thick-headed as she was from time to time. "Do ya really hafta ask that, Red? Come on, it's glaringly obvious!" she stated.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part still did not get it. "What do you mean?" she asked confused.</p><p><b></b>Washu who had heard their conversation came over. Now that the vital signs of her patient were steadily improving she had time for small talk. "What my daughter is hinting at is that he did what he did because he loves you. He wanted to protect his mate and therefore jumped into harms way. Logical thought or rational thought was out of gear at that time as instincts had taken over, Ranma. It also does not matter that he is a cursed woman; at that moment in time he was a man protecting the woman he loves."</p><p><b></b>The redhead thought about that. "You mean he did what he did because he wanted to shelter me with his body? Even though I could've taken the blast a lot better?" she asked incredulous and stopped to think.</p><p><b></b>Damn, that actually made sense! She remembered how Kasumi had talked about the testosterone levels in couples and that they reached equilibrium in both the male and the female to make them most compatible. Obviously due to their dual nature Kasumi had still had had more than enough testosterone in his system to act upon male instincts. One of these instincts was apparently to protect the mate at all costs which he had done.</p><p><b></b>He had risked more than his own hide for her and this act of selflessness and love brought a fresh bout of tears to her eyes. She did not care that it was unmanly to cry; the stupid panda and his manliness crap could go screw himself for all she cared. Kasumi loved her and this had been the ultimate proof; even if it had nearly killed him. Her resolve was reaffirmed. She would tell him that she loved him and that as soon as possible. <b>'Why not right here and now? We're lying near enough together and I have read somewhere that even people in coma can hear when others are talking to them. Yes…' </b></p><p><b></b>Carefully so as not to endanger the transfusion process Ranma reached with her hand for the bigger hand of Kasumi-otoko and grasped it into her smaller hand. She gave a firm squeeze and tears fell down her face when she was finally able to utter the words "I <i>love</i> you, Ka-kun. I love you more than words could ever say. That was the most stupid thing I ever saw that you did for me but also the bravest. I love you and I never want you to leave me. And don't you ever dare doing something this stupid again!" she exclaimed while a tear rolled down her cheek.</p><p><b></b>She could not be sure but Ranma thought she saw the ghost of a smile on his face. However, the sound of a chair being overthrown alerted her to other things. "What the heck?" Ryoko exclaimed. "Mother, come over here pronto!"</p><p><b></b>That Washu did. If Ryoko called her mother than something had to be up. And the eyes of the diminutive scientist widened at what she saw. Ranma had not noticed it herself and why was clear for she had been too fixated on her love. "I'll be!" Washu exclaimed and produced a scanning device from her lab-coat in which she had slipped after the operation had been over. "Damn, I dunno how but something magic-related is happening here. But I can't say what. Damn, this is fascinating!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had a startled expression on her face. Now she noticed the pale-red glow herself but she had no idea what it meant. Instinctively she guessed that it had something to do with the curse magic. She had the distinct feeling that it was acting like some kind of… bridge along with the transfusion. But for what?</p><p><b></b>Whatever the outcome would be she could not even guess. It seemed as if they'd have to ride it out. "I see what ya mean, Washu-chan. But we can't stop the transfusion if we want to save him so we gotta take the chance. Ya said yerself that it ain't something bad what with my blood-factor. I say we gotta cross the bridge when we hafta."</p><p><b></b>Washu nodded and then grinned at her daughter. "She talks just as bad as you do when she's under pressure."</p><p><b></b>"What!" both girls exclaimed in stereo. "I have nothing in common with her!"</p><p><b></b>Both looked at each other and mock-glared while a certain scientist fell over laughing. Ranma and Ryoko looked at each other and nodded. Their revenge would be dreadful!</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Finally visitors were allowed when Kasumi-otoko was stable; three very worried figures entered the medi-lab in protective suits. Washu had already told them that Kasumi would survive but that it had been by a hairbreadth. Naturally everyone had been relieved but the real worries only ever evaporated when one saw visual proof.</p><p><b></b>Thus a heavy load was taken off the minds of Katsuhito, Tenchi and Ayeka when they had their visual proof that Ranma was alright and equally important that Kasumi was alive and improving. The blood-donation was really helping and although Ranma was slowly reaching the maximum amount of blood she could donate it would be enough. It was a close call but it would be sufficient.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito had decided that Mihoshi and Sasami could visit their guests later on and the girls had complied. The three of them were probably more than enough at present. Tenchi was the first to step to the bedside of Ranma. "Hey Ranma. I'm glad that he'll survive, buddy. You can't believe how glad." he said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma, who was by now a bit weak and light-headed due to bloodless smiled. "Me too, pal, me too. But from now on call me Ránmā. Now… I'm Ránmā …" she said and fell asleep.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi directed an alarmed gaze at Washu but Katsuhito put a pacifying hand on the shoulder of his grandson. He had sensed from her aura that she had just fallen asleep. "Don't worry Tenchi, Ránmā just feel asleep from exhaustion and bloodloss." he reassured, instantly using Ranma's chosen name for her female half.</p><p><b></b>The young man nodded relieved as Washu came over. "Oh, so you're a doctor now, Yosho? Want to take over?" she asked in jest.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito waved it aside with a smile. "Kami-sama forbid." he said in mock-indignation. "I would never dare to steal your patients, Washu-chan. I know what is good for my health…" he said, muttering the last part.</p><p><b></b>Washu mock-glared at him. "I should not think so!" she said before sobering up. "But now to more serious matters. The Android that attacked us was one of Dr. Clays as you will have guessed. However the model was very advanced as was obvious; it is my presumption that this Android was his trump card in case he got caught or killed. It was probably activated through a timer and executed its programmed mission after it had 'heard' nothing from its master for a specified amount of time. But unlike Zero this Android had no emotions or conscience. I suspect that Clay made some experimentation on Zero that turned out different than he thought but with our attacker he obviously stuck to the schematics of an emotionless Android. That he gave it the appearance of Ryoko also figures and was easy to achieve. Furthermore this Android was powerful enough for both types of assault, the direct approach or infiltration."</p><p><b></b>She paused to take in a breath. "As you saw this Android was also equipped with a device to block the power of the Light Hawk wings, something I thought impossible prior. But from what I've learned I can say that the Light Hawk wings behave like ki and therefore they <i>can</i> be blocked. I'm still busy with finding a counter to this but maybe Ranma can help us in that regard." she said. Then her face grew very serious. "We have to be very cautious in the next few months. Something is up and I believe it possible that this Android was only a test, a vanguard. Had it not been for our sleeping beauty here and the warning of Tsunami it might even have succeeded. For had especially Tsunami not warned us I might not have deployed the upgraded sensors that gave us at least some advance warning. Oh Yosho, did Tsunami gather enough of the fight by watching through Sasami?"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito grimaced. He had not liked the idea that Sasami had stayed so close to the front-line but in the end he had given in to Tsunami's wishes. "That she did. However, if you're asking how the Android was able to block the wings, not even she has any idea. But she wants to meet Ranma as soon as she has the opportunity. Tsunami was quite impressed with her; but I'd appreciate it if Sasami could hide out in your lab next time, Lil' Washu. That was far too dangerous, even with Mihoshi and me guarding her. You know as well as I do that she won't come into her powers for quite some time." he said in a slightly scolding tone.</p><p><b></b>Washu had the decency to look a tad bit dejected. "I didn't like the idea either, Yosho. But seeing as everything turned out well I don't see the need to reflect on the past. Rather we have to be prepared in the future. Aside from you only Ranma here was able to differ between the fake and the real Ryoko. Had she not been here it would only have had to overcome you, Yosho and all would have been lost."</p><p><b></b>The assessment of the genius scientist caused nodding heads and serious faces all around. "Yeah, I was not even able to hit the beast!" Tenchi exclaimed. "That darn thing was so fast that it made me boil. And my power was completely useless. Little Washu, we must find a way to counter this block or to overcome this device. As soon as the Android was destroyed I was able to use the Light Hawk wings again but it would not do for me to be useless in a fight."</p><p><b></b>"Same here." said Ryoko. "I'd say its time Red here taught us how to become faster and better, eh?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi looked at her and nodded with a grin. "Yeah, she's something else, isn't she? Even if she's a girl right now she's definitely Ranma. He never gave up and always fought till the end. And I must say that <i>she</i> was downright scary after Kasumi here got nearly killed. She was like some fury or something." he stated.</p><p><b></b>Everyone nodded. It was Katsuhito who spoke. "Ranma loves Kasumi very much. When she thought that the Android had killed him she snapped and nothing held her back. I must admit that I was afraid that she might have been gone too far but luckily this fear has proven to be unfounded. She is a deeply caring person, one of the bravest warriors I have met as of yet. She is very much like her mother! Nodoka can be proud of her."</p><p><b></b>"You… you know my mother?" a voice asked from the bio-bed.</p><p><b></b>"Hey! You're awake again! Good!" Tenchi exclaimed. He had sensed that his grandfather did not want to answer this question right now and sought to distract his redheaded friend.</p><p><b></b>It was however not working. If Ranma was a master in one thing then in tactics; and she sensed right away what her friend had in mind. "Yes. Could you please get me a glass of water, Tenchi?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi nodded. "Sure, pal. Be right back." he said and Washu made a door to the living quarters of the lab through which he disappeared.</p><p><b></b>Now that they were undisturbed Ranma asked again while the other girls smiled at how Ranma had played Tenchi. "You know my mother, Master Katsuhito?" she asked formally.</p><p><b></b>The Shinto Priest sat down beside Ranma as everyone looked at him. "Yes." he finally admitted. "I know your mother. Very well, in fact. As I see that you will not be distracted I will tell you the whole story although I would have liked it better to tell it at a later date. But alas, such is fate." the old priest said with a slight smile and looked into the round. "Washu, could you produce some seating-accommodations for us? Thank you." he said at her nod.</p><p><b></b>Washu just jumped upwards and suddenly sat in a floating chair. Nanoseconds later a keyboard appeared in thin air and the genius began typing away. Soon she had produced six comfy looking armchairs practically out of thin air; fact that made another redhead boggle.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka saw the look on her face and smiled while she claimed one of the armchairs; Ryoko did the same. "Think nothing of it, Ranma. She does that all the time."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl nodded, her eyes still somewhat wide. Apparently the impossible was normal around here she thought to herself as she looked at the winking Washu. "I have notified Sasami and Mihoshi to come to the lab. Although I'm quite certain that I will regret it in Mihoshi's case…" the redheaded genius muttered. "10,000 to 1 that she'll destroy something…"</p><p><b></b>Everyone politely pretended not to have heard the last part and waited patiently for the others to arrive. Tenchi was the first to come back and he carried a tray with a bottle of water and a glass. Looking into the round he noticed the comfy armchairs and the youth knew instantly that his grandfather had lost to Ranma.</p><p><b></b>They only ever got the armchairs out if he had a story to tell and it seemed that Ranma or rather Ranma had convinced him to do just that. Shrugging to himself he filled the glass with water and gave it to his friend. Ranma smiled in thanks and carefully gulped the water down.</p><p><b></b>Before Katsuhito began Washu interrupted and removed the transfusion unit as Ranma had reached the maximum amount of blood she could donate without risking her own health. Upon seeing the look the other redhead was giving her Washu nodded in reassurance. "It was enough, Ranma. He'll make it and he won't even have any scars left."</p><p><b></b>Those were the best news she had heard the whole day and the smile Ranma had on her face could have lit up a black hole in its intensity. "Thank you, Washu-chan, for everything." she said in gratefulness.</p><p><b></b>Washu smiled back. "Thank <i>you</i> for kicking the ass of that Android. Without you we would have been toast."</p><p><b></b>"Yeah, Red, she's absolutely right. Once you get better you gotta show me how to make these cool energy attacks. And I will show you how to make a sword with your energy and how to fly properly." Ryoko said.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled. "I'll take you up on that offer, demon woman." she answered.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi and Ayeka also butted in as both wanted to learn those techniques too. As both also had to offer new techniques to learn Ranma was fast to agree. She would have done it without their counteroffers anyway but learning new stuff had never hurt.</p><p><b></b>After Ranma had drunk a good amount of water mixed with a substance to replenish her blood faster she felt loads better; somewhat restored which was also due to her extraordinary constitution and toughness, Katsuhito was finally ready to begin his tale.</p><p><b></b>Sasami together with Ryo-Ohki and Mihoshi (who had indeed managed to demolish a device or the other of Washu's) had joined them too and after expressing their happiness about how everything had turned out for the better they too listened with rapt attention. "I came to know your mother when she was 14, Ranma. It was at a Kendo-tournament in Kobe, a city in the neighbouring prefecture Hyogo. I noticed her talent right away, Ranma; you must know that I only ever taught the family style to family members as per the requirements of a family style." he said with a smile. "But your mother was an exception. She was a raw diamond and I sensed some kind of connection between us. It was her love for the sword as well as something else. You know of us Juraians, back then I suspected your mother to have some Juraian blood in her veins. I could never prove it till this day and it does not really matter. What matters is that she became my apprentice." he said and took a sip from his own glass of water.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded in understanding. Someone had to have taught her mother the way of the sword after all. It was a comforting thought that it had been someone as nice as Katsuhito. Said old priest cleared his throat and continued his tale. "As I had surmised your mother turned out to be very good. She soaked up knowledge like a sponge and never needed much time to master a move. Her parents lived in Himeji at that time so she did not have to travel too far. In the following two years she continued to learn my style and I can rightfully say that she became a master at it. When she turned 16 she was able to achieve the master and she would also have been able to reach even greater heights. But that was the time when she met your father. It was an arranged marriage and it will not come as a surprise that I did not approve of Genma. He was 20 and already much like he seems to be today. Nodoka knew of my dislike for Genma and she wrested the promise from me that I would never harm him. She had seen that I had been hard pressed not to teach him a lesson and scare him away from your mother but Kami-sama knows why, she loved the fool."</p><p><b></b>The redheaded girl nodded as she absorbed the information. It was nice to learn of the background of her mother for a change. In the wake of everything that had happened lately she never had had the time or occasion to sit down with her mother to learn her background.</p><p><b></b>Maybe she should do just that when she came back, sit down with mom and have a good heart-to-heart talk. "It is nice to know that mom had such a good teacher. I can also understand why you did not approve of stupid pop. If he was anything like he is today back then I can not fault you; and I bet that you regretted your promise many times, huh?"</p><p><b></b>The others watched as a lot of emotions ran over Katsuhito's face; fact that was quite odd and made them thoughtful for they had never seen their mentor so emotional. "I admit that I was more than once hard pressed not to slice your stupid oaf of a father in half. To tell you the truth, I was overjoyed for Nodoka when she was pregnant with you. It seemed that your idiotic father had done at least one thing right in his life. In hindsight and with you here now I can rightfully claim that he did." he said with a smile as he ruffled the redheads' hair in an unusual display of affection. "Your mother was like a daughter for me and I'd like to be somewhat of a grandfatherly figure for you, Ranma. It might be due to your curse but you are the granddaughter I never had."</p><p><b></b>That brought tears to Ranma's eyes but this time it were tears of joy. She never had had the feeling of being so welcome before and the thought of having a grandfather, even if it was not her real grandfather, was more than heart warming for the redhead. "I'd love to, grandfather." she said with a smile as she wiped her tears away.</p><p><b></b>Everyone present was hard-pressed to suppress the 'Ohhs' and 'Ahhs' when Katsuhito gave Ranma a half-hug; half because Ranma was still lying on the bio-bed. Tenchi smiled at his childhood friend and was very happy for the boy-turned-girl. In his opinion it was high time that things were going Ranma's way. His friend deserved love and friendship for a change where before had only been mistrust and constant vigilance. He was also very proud of his grandfather who had once more managed to surprise him.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka on her part was also proud of her half-brother. What he had done could only be described as the most empathic thing she had witnessed in a long time. And with her being over 700 years old that meant something. But one thing lurked in the back of her mind, one question bothered her. What if Nodoka Saotome had indeed Juraian blood in her?</p><p><b></b>Ryoko on her part was happy for the redhead too. Ranma was really someone who had proven herself as a warrior. She had stood up to a force that Tenchi and she had hardly been able to lay hands on and she had actually emerged victorious against all odds.</p><p><b></b>When the person she loved had been (nearly) killed she had shown that she did not give in and had fought on with a vengeance. Her display of power had been truly awe-inspiring and Ryoko would do her best to never get onto her bad side. Those tornados she had fired at her look-alike had been really something else! Not to mention the huge red energy wave that had finally destroyed Clay's evil Android.</p><p><b></b>The cyan-haired alien was also glad that Ranma finally had found the safe harbour that even a warrior needed. No one could exist without the support of love and friendship; and gauging from what she knew of Ranma's life up till now she had had few real friends and way too much foes or at least rivals. No one deserved such a life and she vowed to pay the main root for Ranma's many problems a 'goodwill visit' in the near future.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Finally Washu had thrown everyone beside Katsuhito out of the med-lab. The Shinto priest wanted to remain behind to tell Ranma a few more things about her mother and the redhead was more than glad to just listen and ask questions for a change. …"you know, you look very much like your mother did at your age. And you're just as talented." the old man said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed and uttered a small "Thank you." while she still held the hand of her love. His breathing was regular and Washu had more than once reassured her that everything was alright with him and that he was healing. Tomorrow he could be moved into the rejuvenation tank and in a few days he would be restored to as good as new.</p><p><b></b>This information alone had made Ranma the happiest woman on the planet. Ever since that had happened to Kasumi she had not once thought about her gender or the lock on the curse; she had just been a normal woman, a female warrior. Maybe that was what her mother had meant with her being both sides of the coin. The feeling she had had before was slowing fading; before she had always had a feeling of her phantom-manliness, as if she still had had her male equipment despite being in a woman's body. Maybe she was now really on the way to becoming both…</p><p><b></b>At the moment she did not care much and repressed these thoughts for later analysis. Just listening to Katsuhito talking about her mother was taxing enough. She had had a very tiring, no downright exhausting day but hearing about her mother kept her awake and the sleep at bay. From him she'd learned more about her mother than she ever had from her own father. This was kind of sad, actually. A husband should be proud of his wife, especially towards his own children. If that was not the case what was the marriage worth?</p><p><b></b>Inwardly cursing her stupid oaf of a father for being such an idiot towards her mother she tuned her attention back to Katsuhito. The old man smiled at her and she noticed that he had apparently waiting for her to snap out of her musings. The realisation made her blush. "Sorry, I spaced off a bit."</p><p><b></b>The smile on Katsuhito's face deepened. "Think nothing of it, Ranma. I'm an old man; I have all the time in the world. Especially considering my age." he said in jest.</p><p><b></b>The redheaded girl nodded. "I still can barely believe that you are over 2,000 years old! How much you must have seen…" she mused.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded sagely. "Yes, that I have. Some things good, some things bad. But if I have learned one thing in my long existence, than that things tend to balance out. Look at your parents for example. Normally your mother would balance the stupidity of your father out and I suspect that is now the case once more. Probably more than ever." he said with a slight smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "You can count on it, grandpa. Knowing mom she'll discipline stupid pops with her katana. Kami-sama knows that the idiot deserves it." she grumbled.</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto priest nodded once more. "I should think so." he said with a smile. "Things tend to balance each other out. Look at you. You are the perfect example for it. Due to a twist of fate you became both man and woman. Only now you are starting to balance yourself out and don't you feel much better already now that the process has finally begun?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl thought for a moment before answering. "It is true, isn't it? Now that I have started to accept this half of me as a part of me and nothing separate I have started to become more than I was. Whoa, that is deep stuff. I really gotta think about that one." she said to herself.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled. "You do that, granddaughter. But everything at the proper time."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded as she mirrored his smile, yawned once and finally fell asleep. The old Shinto priest still smiled as he pulled one of the blankets Washu had provided over her. He ruffled her hair in an affectionate way once more. "Sleep well, Ranma. Kami-sama knows that you deserve the rest." he said and left the lab.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Next morning Ranma awoke with a splitting headache that told her that she should take in some fluid real soon. But her first vista was reserved for her love; unsurprisingly she panicked when she noticed that the bio-bed beside her was utterly empty.</p><p><b></b>A soothing voice however brought her out of her panic. "Don't worry, granddaughter. He's is as safe as can be. Little Washu moved him into the regeneration tank two hours ago. We did not want to wake you as you needed the rest to restore your energies. Kasumi is healing and in a few days he'll be up and about again, as good as new. Lil' Washu could not say how long it would take for him to heal but she was sure that it would not be longer than a week."</p><p><b></b>Relieved and with a thankful expression on her face Ranma sunk back onto the bio-bed. She could not believe that she had panicked so much but surmised that it was understandable considering what she had been through. Apparently Cologne had been right; the emotional make-up of girls was vastly different but she was not ashamed of herself. She had nearly lost the love of her life for good and crying because of that was not weak. "Thank you, grandfather. You wouldn't believe how relieved I am to hear this. For a short moment I thought something bad had happened. Thanks for easing my worries."</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto Priest smiled at her. "You're welcome. Do you feel strong enough for getting up and enjoying a late breakfast with an old man?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled back. "Sure, but I don't see an old man here anywhere." she jested.</p><p><b></b>Now that she knew that her love was okay her mood had improved considerably. It had been one hell of a day yesterday but it seemed that everything had turned out for the better. Granted, that her love had been nearly killed had been one of the worst moments in her life if not <i>the</i> worst moment but all that mattered was that Kasumi was safe and sound now.</p><p><b></b>In addition she had now a grandfather, even if it was not a real, meaning biological grandfather; and that meant a lot to her. Also, it seemed as if some kind of warrior-bond had formed between her and Ryoko. Ever since after the fight between them their relationship had vastly improved and apparently her fight against the Android had been final proof of her worth. All in all not bad, she mused. Without help Ranma got up from her bio-bed without any problems and together the two left the lab.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Katsuhito had settled down in the living room a few minutes later. Sasami had provided vast quantities of food as a precaution and the redhead was thankful for it. She was so hungry like never before in her life and dug in with gusto.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito ate his share but of course it paled verily in comparison to what Ranma packed away. The amount she consumed was not surprising considering as well the amount of energy she had used up in the fight as well as the amount of blood she had donated to save her love. The potion to replenish her blood had already done a good job but the food was needed just as much.</p><p><b></b>After half an hour of eating and drinking straight Ranma was finally filled. The Saiyans from Dragonball Z could not have packed away more and would probably have been proud to welcome her in their midst. Katsuhito on his part had busied himself with the paper of today and enjoyed his third coffee.</p><p><b></b>Seeing that Ranma was finished he took a sip, placed his cup on the table and cleared his throat. "I made two promises to your mother, Ranma." he began. "The first promise I made was that should I ever meet you I would <i>not</i> teach my family art to you. This promise also contained that I would never exert any influence on your life; why I will explain soon. However this promise becomes invalid per our agreement if you yourself ever met me and asked me to. And here you are now." he said with a smile. "You are truly Nodoka's child and you inherited all of her talent and then some, Ranma. You have become so powerful that I can rightfully train you in my family art if you wish so." he said with pride obvious on his face. Then his expression darkened. "The other promise I made was that I would never harm your father in any way, as I already mentioned before."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked dumbfounded for a moment before she gathered her bearings. Silently she helped herself to yet another cup of tea before asking the question she had. "Why did mom wrench these promises from you, grandfather?"</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto priest smiled a sad smile in answer. "Your mother is a brilliant woman and an excellent sword-fighter. She recognised fast that the higher and more complicated moves of the Juraian sword style are designed to kill; it's an Art of war after all. Nodoka on her part recognised that sometimes the need would arise were she rather had to kill an opponent than to disable or disarm him or her; but she never wanted for <i>you</i> to have to kill someone. If it had been up to her you would not have become a martial artist at all so that you'd never have to make a life-or-death decision. Yet you were the only heir to the Saotome school and as such your mother gave in when your father demanded that you be trained as a martial artist. Especially when you showed so much potential already at a very young age."</p><p><b></b>The redhead looked dumbfounded. "Mom is really an excellent sword-fighter? Hmm," she said and raised a hand to her chin, "when I met mom first she was rather clumsy with her katana. In fact she nearly un-manned me with it. Boy was I glad that I was a girl at that time. Wait… was that… was that all some kind of deceit?"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito's eyes gleamed with mirth. Ranma was indeed the child of Nodoka. "I see that you're as clever as your mother, Ranma." he said with a smile. "One integral part of my sword-style is to never reveal it to anyone outside from a battle; that's why your mother acts clumsy when non-combatants are around her. Not so that she would accidentally harm anyone around her but so that it is convincing. You would not believe how long it took her to act the klutzy part convincingly. She was just too talented." he said as he smiled in remembrance.</p><p><b></b>Ranma boggled. "Mom is hiding what she's really got up her sleeve? Damn she's more like me than I would have ever thought… and I never guessed a thing!" she exclaimed excitedly. Then she sobered up as her interest had been picked. "Is your style really one of war, grandfather?"</p><p><b></b>He nodded solemnly. "Yes. It was invented several millennia ago as a means to defend the Juraian Crown. Our line has been aspirants to the throne for a long time and as thus we had to learn how to defend ourselves. Bodyguards are always a unreliability as they can be overcome or bribed. That's why the family style was developed. The sword-style accommodates best to our natural Juraian powers but your mother was more than talented enough to learn it even without having these powers." he said and paused to take a sip from his coffee.</p><p><b></b>"That is also why she wrenched this promise from me." he continued. "She herself trained in an Art meant to kill while your father also was a disciple in an Art of war. In fact the Anything Goes Style is nothing but an Art of war but largely without the component of having to kill your opponent. It was the will of your mother that you should never learn my style, Ranma. She never wanted that you would have to kill someone in a battle. Nodoka knew that you were destined to be a martial artist or even a great warrior as you come from a long line of warriors but she wanted to protect you as much as possible. That's why she probably never mentioned me; she did not want her child to become a warrior."</p><p><b></b>That remark hit home verily. "But… but now I <i>have</i> already killed someone. Saffron. And even if he regenerated the fact remains that I killed him and meant to do it." she said and looked downwards. "Thanks to my love I have begun to accept that I had no other choice but it still hurts all the same. I took a life when my Art is meant to protect people." she said with tears brimming in her eyes. Then she looked up. "I can understand where mom is coming from. Can you tell me what her wishes and dreams for me were? Has she ever talked to you when she was pregnant with me or after my birth?"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito stroked his chin and nodded. "Your mother was 18 when you were conceived and she trained in the family style for the first four months of her pregnancy. Yes, we talked. I was somewhat of a father to your mother as her parents had died when she was 17. As a matter of fact she lived here for quite some time after her parents had died in a car crash. And as far as I know from Nodoka's hopes and wishes for you she wanted you to become as manly as possible. In fact she wanted you to become a real ladies man." he said with a smile, and Ranma joined in, smiling at the irony of it; at the moment she was anything but a ladies man. "Ranma, you might know or not that in Japanese culture the word and ideals of a mother regarding her son have a lot of meaning; but in the regard of the training trip you and your father undertook she lost to your father, obviously."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "You can say that again. Sometimes I think that he just wanted to use the trip to create some sorta legacy; Ranma Saotome, his ultimate tribute to the Art. Stupid pops. But ya mean ta say that mother could have raised me to be as manly as possible because her word over me had so much meaning? Is that maybe why stupid pops took me and ran away with me for over ten years and just left that stupid contract behind? Did he really fear that mother would 'corrupt' me and make me into some kind of playboy?" she asked more to herself than anyone.</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto priest looked thoughtful once more before answering. "I believe that your oaf of a father thought and feared just that. By running away with you and leaving on such a long journey he wanted to minimise the danger that your mother could take part in your upbringing. I kept the contact with your mother even after you were born and when I learned from her that your father had ran away with you on a training trip, just leaving this darn contract behind I was furious and ready to hunt your father down. However, your mother refused to even take the help of her old sensei, me, as she said it was a family matter. She trusted your father that he'd in actuality make you a real man among men, a son she could be proud of. Thus I could only sit back and watch. But I can honestly say that your mother missed you very much, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>That came as a major surprise for Ranma. "Wow. You know, when I met mom for the first time she really seemed determined to go through with that stupid contract. I had the feeling that it had become some kind of surrogate for me over the years, something to remember and measure me by. Sometimes I ask myself why mom accepted the contract and let pop leave with me in the first place…"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled sadly from his position across Ranma. "That may sound a bit harsh, granddaughter, but your mother was foolish to accept it. Yet she was only barely over twenty years old and had a lot of… unusual ideas and concepts; thus it is somewhat understandable. You are the child of a martial artist and I can believe that when your father acted manly and determined enough that he had an easy time convincing your mother. The Seppuku contract was just the icing on the cake and should show your mother that she would get something out of the deal. Your father promised to make you the manliest son, a son she could be proud of; and that is probably what made her blind to the fact that she practically surrendered your upbringing to your father. Your mother was a sometimes more emotional and excitable woman and I fear your father exploited this to fulfil his own dreams he had with you. Yet he created a situation that nearly killed you and you can believe me when I say that I am very glad that Nodoka did not hold you to the contract."</p><p><b></b>That was a lot to take in and Ranma needed some moments to absorb the information she had just received. <b>'Yes, mom is indeed one to get excited fast. Especially when it came to manliness and to grandchildren. Though I have the lingering suspicion that mom still wants grandchildren… badly. And I can just believe that stupid pops wanted to leave at all costs so that mom would not spoil me. He was probably already a woman-hating idiot back then and getting away from mom was his way to be free…but to make that idiotic contract because of that… baka oyaji.'</b> she mused.</p><p><b></b>Seeing her introspective mood Katsuhito gave his own opinion. "I think your mother should have never let you leave with your father as every child deserves the motherly influence and love only a caring mother can offer. But Fate had obviously other plans with you and made you a practical test for your mother because of your dual nature. I'm really glad for the two of you that she passed. For had she insisted upon that you were unmanly because of your affliction and would have insisted upon the contract being fulfilled I am sure that Kami-sama would not have judged her gently. The contract your father practically forced upon her might have been <i>his</i> stupid idea but had Nodoka chosen to go through with it she would have been as guilty as he. Yet she did not go through with it and that has more to do with her heart than her sense of honour."</p><p><b></b>Ranma thought intently about his words and then she nodded after a while. "Now I understand… I always asked myself <i>why</i> mom deemed the contract fulfilled. With this body I could not meet the wording of the contract as I am and always will be half-female. A girl can hardly be a man among men after all. For how is a girl supposed to be manly? That's why pops and me hid so long from her. Yet the contract stated I'd become a man among men or die. Mom did not deem the contract fulfilled cause she thought me manly enough but cause she loves me." she concluded with a thoughtful expression. "Mom is a real honourable person but in the end her love for me won over her sense of honour, as weird as it was regarding the whole manliness thing."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito paused to think then he nodded. "I believe you're right, Ranma. I suppose that after your mother encountered you face to face for the first time and saw what a wonderful young person you had become despite the upbringing your father provided she must have realised that a piece of paper signed by a five year old and with finger-prints to boot was not as important as her child; regardless if you were male or female. Your mother might have been blinded by her desire for you to become the manliest man alive and your father surely helped that along. But in the end her motherly love won over this desire. That shows especially therein that she let go of her views of manliness and accepted you as your daughter, Ranma. Nodoka loves you, that you can be sure of."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled at these words which had warmed her heart. She had felt before that her mother really loved her contrary to what stupid pops had always claimed. But to hear something like that from her mother's old sensei, a man who apparently knew her mother well and had kept up with what she had been doing was… heart-warming and comforting. "You… you are right. Mom loves me and that is everything that matters. But stupid pop is so in for it when I see him the next time."</p><p><b></b>The day had taken its toll on Ranma and especially on her emotional make-up and a lot of dams had been broken. Despite the conscious knowledge that her mother loved her, fact she had come to know after she had saved her mother from falling into the ocean after the stunt baka oyaji had pulled, there had always been a rest of doubt.</p><p><b></b>She had always asked herself why her mother had allowed that she had been taken away from her and why she had apparently never tried to take her back. What Katsuhito had said made perfect sense. Her mother had blindly trusted her father but she had apparently underestimated his unrivalled talent to screw up. Maybe her mother had not known just how much the training of the old lech had screwed him up. Yes, that was most probable.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl looked up as Katsuhito ruffled her hair. "That she does, Ranma. Nodoka loves you very much and it is good to hear that she let go of her stranger ideas. I'm sure that she would have been an excellent mother had your father given her the chance to take part in your upbringing. But it is safe to assume that you would not be what you are now in such a case. For had the training trip never happened you would probably not be here right now. I think that after your parents were unable to conceive a second child it became somewhat of a fixation for your mother to have the manliest son possible; you were her only child, a son, and as she could not have a daughter she wanted you to be as manly as possible."</p><p><b></b>Ranma sweatdropped. "Mom wanted a daughter? Wow I would never have guessed. Man, I guess her concept of manliness and her wish to have a daughter must have really clashed when she found out about the curse! But that means by really becoming both I could fulfil her wish…" she muttered to herself. "Damn, I would never have guessed…" she exclaimed, repeating her words from earlier. But it made perfect sense, seeing the way her mother had always treated 'Ranma Tendo'.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled at her insight. It had indeed been Nodoka's greatest desire to have a daughter and the curse offered her this chance undeniably. However it would not do for Ranma to forget her male half. She might be a girl as of now but she had been born male; that was something she should never forget.</p><p>"That is all good and nice, Ranma, but you must not forget the reason <i>why</i> you're undertaking this journey to self-discovery. You are in the process of finding your femininity and as far as I can tell you are making good way. However, regardless of the wishes others have for you never forget that you are both, Ranma. Both a man and a woman; it is essential that you find a balance between the two."</p><p><b></b>After thinking about the words of her grandfather she nodded. "Don't worry, grandpa. I will never forget where I'm coming from but I <i>have</i> begun to embrace my femininity; especially after what happened to my love. During the fight with that Android I just did not care that I was a girl. I just was and it felt natural to me; you know for the first time I did not have the feeling any more that I was a foreigner in this body as strange as that may sound. I'm really beginning to realise that I am this girl and I really understand that I'll need these three months to really get used to how the other half lives. I wouldn't have thought it but maybe this body has more to offer than just good looks."</p><p><b></b>From across her Katsuhito smiled. It really seemed as if the shock of having Kasumi (or was it Yoshiro now?) nearly killed and the subsequent fight and destruction of Clays new Android had led to a lot of self-discovery for his new granddaughter. And that was good. "I suspect you only used this body before to do something like getting ice-cream for free, am I right, granddaughter?" he asked. At seeing her blush he continued. "I was just playing you, dear. Your insights are very mature and I'm happy that you've started to realise this. However I can only begin to imagine how confused you must be. For most of humanity the gender is a constant yet yours is normally in flux and can change at the drop of some cold liquid. I can imagine that it got too much sometimes; that's probably also why you never fully accepted that you are a girl too. Just ignoring it and changing back was a lot easier than to deal with the knowledge that this body is just as real as your birth form."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded and sighed. "You hit it right on the dot, grandfather. Sometimes I was really confused and not a few times I felt like I would snap. But after Jusendo, after all the springs formed into one and especially after I learned that there are no cures for the curses and after our journey towards here I have really started to accept this half of me as a part of me. You're right, before I always saw this girl here," she pointed at herself, "as something separate; something to get rid of. Now this has changed and I have actually begun to feel comfortable as a girl. That's also because I know that I won't lose myself and become a girl in mind. I can go as far as I wish yet I'll still remain the same old Ranma Saotome. This is me just as much as my male half is Ranma Saotome. It's quite sad that it nearly took the death of my love to realise this but I will live the next three months as the other side of the coin and I will do my utmost to enjoy it. However I am going to be my kind of girl and not what mom wishes of me."</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto Priest nodded sagely and had to hide a grin at Ranma's last statement. "Yes, I fear your mother would go well overboard in her attempt to make you as feminine as possible seeing as she has you now as her daughter." he sighed. "Nodoka means well but sometimes she just can't stop herself. It will be hard on you but you have to make her accept that you have to find your own way in becoming the girl you want to be. From what I know of your life you never had much choice in what happened in your life and in my opinion it is high time that this changed. If necessary I'll take your mother aside and talk some sense into her; believe me I got experience in it."</p><p><b></b>The redhead smiled at hearing this. It was good to have supporters. "That would be nice. She needs to understand that I won't wear frilly dresses or anything; if anything I'm going to be somewhat of a tomboy. Kami-sama forbid that I have to act like a lady!" she exclaimed and threw her hands into the air in mock-exasperation.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito laughed. "Well, that's something that can't be avoided completely, granddaughter. Society expects girls to act in a certain way and as you found out for yourself you are as much a girl as you are a boy. Granted, as far as I know girls have some leeway and are allowed to act tomboyish for a certain amount of time but you have to learn how to behave properly. I believe my half-sister Ayeka could be of help in that regard. If anyone knows how to act lady-like than she." he said with a smile. "Keep in mind that you can take the knowledge she offers and adapt it for your use. Just see it as a kind of technique that you adapt to your needs after you have learned the basics. After all, learning behaviour is nothing more than learning a set of rules; not unlike what we do when we learn a scroll. We learn the rules of the technique and once we got the basics down we can modify them. I hope that makes sense to you."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl thought once more about what her grandfather had said. Indeed it made perfect sense to her and seeing it as some kind of technique she had to learn helped. "I understand, grandpa." she said and then a smile graced her face. "I ask myself why no one ever thought to invent Martial Arts Behavioural improvement for tomboy's classes." she jested.</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto priest smiled. "Maybe because it has yet to be invented?" he asked innocently.</p><p><b></b>The redhead laughed. "That may indeed be the case. And the great Ranma Saotome together with Ayeka Jurai will do just that." she exclaimed pompously. Then she sobered up. "That reminds me. How are the others? I had no chance to talk to anyone about the fight."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled at the care in her voice. "Everyone is fine, Ranma. But I admit had it not been for you things would have probably gone very differently. As you already guessed that thing that attacked us was an Android. In fact it was apparently sent by the same man who tried to kill us all some months ago. Dr. Clay. However this model was a lot more powerful than Zero, the Android he sent out first. In contrast to Zero the Android you defeated had no emotions I could sense. It was just a machine programmed for death and destruction. Little Washu is currently investigating the matter and knowing her she'll come up with results soon."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked thoughtful and stroked her chin. "Grandpa… did you <i>expect</i> an attack?" she asked bluntly.</p><p><b></b>That surprised Katsuhito. "What makes you think that?"</p><p><b></b>The redhead was still looking thoughtful as she gnawed on all the pieces of the puzzle before her. "I have some pointers. First that communication device went off and you were away for at least ten minutes. Then, when the attack occurred every single fighter of this household was already on guard and waiting outside while the non-combatants were hiding in the house. Just Kasumi and me were upstairs and left in the dark; out of the way, so to speak. Those are all pointers in the direction that you expected an attack." she finished.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito was once more impressed with the abilities his new granddaughter possessed. Finally he nodded. "You're right, Ranma. We were warned by Tsunami that an attack was impending. As you know, Dr. Clay is currently in custody of the Galaxy Police and will serve a long-term sentence for his various crimes. However Tsunami detected that somehow an Android of Clays' had become active; Tsunami was however unable to interfere as this Android had boarded a high-warp spaceship and was heading straight for the third planet of the sol system, Earth. Thus she could do little more but warn us and watch through Sasami; so yes, we had an advance warning and if it had been possible we would have left you out of the fight. But as we all know things developed differently."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded to herself while she helped herself to some more tea. Hers was cold by now. "So my instincts were right. But what is it with this Dr. Clay, grandpa? Why is he so dead-set on killing everyone of the Masaki house? I know that you have thwarted his plans but why did he go off the deep end?"</p><p><b></b>The Shinto priest sighed. "I know it is overly cliché but this guy is in fact a scientist who has indeed crossed the line from genius to insanity. Dr. Clay was Little Washu's competitor for a high position within the Science Academy and when he lost to her he swore vengeance. This led to what we described before. We stopped Dr. Clay but apparently he had something up his sleeve. I only hope that it was the last surprise from him for I admit without you we would have lost."</p><p><b></b>Pride welled up at her grandfathers' words. She had been praised so seldom in her life that she cherished the few occasions were it happened. Wiping of the smirk she knew was on her face she became earnest once more. "Do you think he has more Androids that are just waiting to be activated? Or was the one we fought just a prototype?"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito shook his head. "I have no idea, Ranma. I hope that Washu will be able to give us the answers." he said while he helped himself to some more coffee.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Either way, we'll have to assume the worst and prepare for it. I still have not decided if I will ask you to teach me your style but I really want to teach Ryoko, Tenchi and Ayeka how to become faster and better. Especially Ryoko has got tons of potential and she is already as strong as me, if not stronger! If she would have been as fast as I am she could have toasted the tin-can on her own. Tenchi I have not really evaluated as of yet but if what I think is right then he's one of the big players too. Same goes for Ayeka. My gut-feeling tells me they're all really powerful but they need to improve their speed. Drastically."</p><p><b></b>Her new grandfather nodded, pleased with her assessment. "You're completely right; those three are very powerful but they could indeed use an upgrade in speed. So if you want to train them you have free reign. I urge you however to think about me teaching you my style. You could benefit greatly from it."</p><p><b></b>The redhead shook her head as if to clear it. "Wow it seems Fate never gives me a break, does it? You know, I so longed to come to know my mom and when I finally could I found out that I could not cause of that idiotic pledge. Then finally my mom accepts me but keeps pestering me with her 'unique' views of manliness. Then…"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled and laid a hand on hers. "Nodoka always wanted a manly son she could be proud of for that had always been a fixation of hers; but that is now over and done with as you said yourself. But you still have to be on your toes regarding one thing: aside from children Nodoka always had the strange idea to become a grandmother as early as possible in her life; why you know now. And when you were born her son she hoped that you'd be very manly and make her a multiple grandmother in your time."</p><p><b></b>The redhead boggled. "Mom really had such ideas? Damn and I can really believe that after those strange ideas of manliness she had. Thank Kami-sama and my love that she let go of them. But it really seems that Fate wanted me this way. That also means that had pop not taken me away I'd never become what I am now…" she concluded.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito ruffled her hair. "Don't dwell too much on the past, Ranma. Fate had its reasons why it made you what you are now. And fact is that I can teach you in the full and uncut Juraian sword style if you wish so. I'll have to confer with Nodoka once I have your decision but the promise I made to her can become invalid in the blink of an eye. You now know the background and it is now up to you if the promise I gave to your mother will become invalid or not."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked thoughtful. "Grandfather, I don't want to be disrespectful… but I dunno if I even wanta learn the style. Ya know, pop always taught me that weapons are for the weak and once you get disarmed you're as good as dead. I mean he taught the basics of each weapon-style to me so that I can disarm any weapons user but actually using a weapon…" she trailed off with a somewhat revolted expression.</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto priest was hard pressed not to curse in several languages. Just how much had Genma Saotome screwed his child up? It was a miracle that Ranma had turned out as well as she had. "Ranma, I understand and I would never pressure you into something you do not want. But keep in mind, weren't most of the teachings of Genma incomplete or sorely lacking? So all I ask is that you reflect upon what I offered you. A weapon can be an additional tool that will aid your already impressive hand-to-hand skills, keep that in mind." he said with a sage smile. <b>'And you'll need all the power and skills for what is to come… but right now its too early to burden you with what I know.'</b> he added mentally.</p><p><b></b>That remark hit home and made Ranma really thoughtful. She'd really have to think about it, but later. Now she had to take in as much food as possible in order to recuperate most efficiently. Thus she dug in with gusto in what was left of the breakfast while a smiling Katsuhito watched.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Finally even Ranma was filled and when she saw the smile on Katsuhito's face she smiled back sheepishly. "Heh, lately it takes quite a bit to get me filled. But I'm a growing girl."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhitos smile deepened. "That you are. And I bet once the difference in height and weight are not so extreme any more that you will get used to your female half even better." he said while hiding his smirk at knowing something about her the redhead did not.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "That has always been one lf the main reasons why I changed back so fast. You have no idea how off it feels to suddenly weigh 40 pounds less; and more than one foot in height difference is also nothing to laugh at."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled. "You're right, I have no idea. But you should take a look in the mirror the next chance you have. You might be surprised." he said mysteriously.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth wanted to be in on the secret but the Shinto priest just smiled a secretive smile. "You'll know what I mean once you look at yourself in the mirror. It is no wonder you didn't notice after the ordeal you went through."</p><p><b></b>Ranma just looked puzzled. What had she not noticed? However as hard as she tried to discern it she had no success and gave up. Then another thought hit her. "Ordeal... damn! I'll have to notify at least mom and Mr. Tendo what happened to my love. I bet they'll want to see him. Heck, <i>I</i> would want to." she mused.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded. It was a good thing that she had thought of that herself; for it would have been somewhat awkward had he had to suggest it seeing as the two had undertaken this trip to get away also from their parents. He was sure that Ranma had also thought of this and he was proud of her that she had decided to let the parents know. "Best talk to little Washu, Ranma; for she'll have ideas on how to get them here. She's currently in the innards of her lab and it would be wise not to disturb her. However I am sure that she'll come out soon. If anything she's efficient."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Sounds good, grandpa. But I can already write mom a message. That reminds me, I haven't checked for mails in too long. However stupid pops is not allowed here. I might be tempted to skin him..." she growled out.</p><p><b></b>The Shinto priest nodded. He could understand these feelings perfectly. No other individual made it as difficult for him to regain his equilibrium. "That might be a good idea knowing his tendencies." he mused.</p><p><b></b>Ranma growled once more as she pulled her laptop from stuff space. Feat that surprised a certain Shinto priest quite thoroughly. He had only ever seen Washu pull things out of thin air. The smile Ranma wore promised an explanation later. With a secretive smile of knowing something he did not she fired up the laptop. Once the OS had loaded completely she checked for WLAN-hotspots like Nabiki had taught her.</p><p><b></b>Like the time before it worked like a charm. The lessons with Nabiki had really been worth her time and money. But had Hiroshi not tipped her off how useful computers could be she would still be ignorant to the marvels of modern technical. When she had recognised the worth of computers she had vowed that she'd never ignore something that could be to her benefit again. That was also why she was giving the offer of Katsuhito some serious thought.</p><p><b></b>Finally the computer indicated that it needed a login and password to continue and Ranma wanted to give up, utterly frustrated. However to her surprise her new grandfather was able to help her and using his id and password he logged in. Ranma smiled at him as she resumed control over her laptop once more and next she started up the browser and logged in to check her mails. Unsurprisingly she had mail. The content however was a surprise...</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
