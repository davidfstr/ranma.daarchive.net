No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 22: The calm before the storm</b></p><p><b></b>It was once more a beautiful morning at the Masaki house which was sitting peacefully at the outskirts of Okayama. The sun was gradually warming the air, birds were twittering in the nearby forest and the air was quiet and peaceful.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi had slept very well in their separate beds in the second story. Although their relationship was progressing fast both had found it improper to share a single bed as of yet; aside from using it to smooch the live from the other during an activity widely known as making out of course.</p><p><b></b>Even though they had slept together in a single tent already they still believed that it would be more proper to wait with sleeping in the same bed until they were at least engaged. The counter-argument to the fact that they'd shared a single tent before already had been that they had used two different sleeping bags there and then. Or so they tried to tell themselves.</p><p><b></b>Thus they had slept in different rooms but none of them had gone to sleep before engaging in an all-around enjoyed make-out session. As they had a lot of feelings for each other it had taken quite some time until they had just been content with being snuggled up to each other.</p><p><b></b>After all, both wanted to enjoy cuddling with the other in his/her birth form for a last time for three (or maybe more) months; and boy <i>had</i> they enjoyed doing so. Sure, making out in their alternate forms was probably just as good and intense, but it still did feel a tiny bit better to make out in their birth forms.</p><p><b></b>Both were however very careful not to go too far; their inherent sense of honour helped in this regard. A lot. As well Ranma as Kasumi did not want to have intercourse before they were wed or had at least proposed, and even then they would only have sex with protection. It was simply too early for a child. First their financial future had to be ensured, as much as that would probably sadden auntie Saotome. There was also the matter to solve the remaining messes Genma had left for Ranma to clear. And those were still quite a few.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist had returned to his own room stealthily some hours after they'd disappeared into Kasumi's room, for it had just felt too wonderful how Kasumi had lain in his arms after they had finished smooching the life out of each other.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on his part enjoyed that he had not been woken up the same way as nearly any other time for more than one year: with a bucket of cold water to the face or a throw into the koi-pond. Undisturbed sleep really did wonders and he actually felt… relaxed. Lying under the covers of his bed he mused to himself that he could get used to waking up this way; the only thing missing to make it perfect would have been his Kasumi. But that would come in due time.</p><p><b></b>Lying with his arms crossed behind his head Ranma mused about the changes that had happened to his life; most were changes for the better. Today these changes would culminate for today would be the day when they would lock themselves in their cursed forms. For three months. Ranma could barely believe it. In former times he would have fought tooth and nail before he would have let himself be locked in his cursed form. Weird how ones outlook on things could change.</p><p><b></b>Anyway, now he was planning to do it of his own free will, and he had told Kasumi last night that he found this change in attitude in himself quite astounding. With a smile he had said that it must be her influence on him and her attitude towards the curse that was rubbing off on him, for she was making admittedly very good progress at adapting to her curse. Granted she did not have a stupid panda harping at her all the time or a downright idiotic Seppuku pledge hanging over her head but her acceptance of the situation was nonetheless inspiring.</p><p><b></b>When Kasumi was in guy-form he would always try to speak as masculine as possible, not exaggerated, but normal. And slowly Ranma began to believe that what Cologne had said was true. The curse obviously really included a manual how to handle the cursed body, including specific speech patterns and other stuff; this manual obviously really helped a curse victim to adapt if one did not fight the curse the whole time.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had noticed it himself when he had been in his female form on and off for nearly over two weeks now. Without the constant harpings from pop and without the need to be manly at all events it was much easier to get used to the curse and its effects; sometimes being a girl had even bordered on fun with Kasumi around. The speech patterns had become progressively more feminine, but Kasumi had been right in the regard that Ranma didn't need to fear becoming a giggling school-girl.</p><p><b></b>It was the personality that played a decisive role, and Ranma Saotome's personality was primarily male. It was beginning to balance itself with his feminine side, and maybe it would reach equilibrium in the end, become a true blend of male and female; even if he would not admit that to anyone, lest of all to himself as of yet. Ranma could however not deny that he had begun to travel the road that would eventually lead to acceptance and ultimately equilibrium.</p><p><b></b>Satisfied that one of his greatest fears would not come to pass he went to the bathroom. Few moments later he was enjoying the feeling to pee standing for the last time for three months. Girls <i>could</i> pee standing, but it was not advisable. That he had found out in China, as he had told Kasumi. And it was really something he would miss. But he had already come to terms with the different way of plumbing in the past and he accepted the challenge to face his femininity; he would simply be the very best girl he could be and try to enjoy it.</p><p><b></b>But never, never ever would Ranma Saotome wear pink as a girl! Sooner hell would freeze over and pigs would learn how to fly under their own power. Ab-so-lute-ly not! And come there hell or high water, no one, not even Kasumi or Sasami would be able to convince Ranma Saotome to wear pink. Never!</p><p><b></b>Once he was finished in the bathroom and had checked Kasumi's room to find her already gone Ranma dressed and went downstairs, sniffing the air and smelling a beautiful aroma. Breakfast! Yummy! This aroma made him almost forget the 'threat' Mihoshi had uttered yesterday. Brr, a shopping trip. <b>'Meh, better concentrate on nice things…'</b> Ranma thought.</p><p><b></b>Tuning out his thoughts about dreadful shopping-trips he concentrated on the heavenly aroma that permeated the air. Unsurprisingly it was a Ranma with an already watering mouth that entered the kitchen, and he found that Kasumi was already sitting at the table, apparently enjoying a cup of Darjeeling tea.</p><p><b></b>As soon as she saw him she graced him with a dazzling smile, a smile that he returned in kind. "Good morning, love." "Good morning, Kas-chan."</p><p><b></b>Ranma went to the chair where Kasumi was sitting, wished Sasami a "Good morning!" in the process, which she returned in kind and with a smile, and with a smile of his own he stood behind Kasumi. He then bent down, leant forward and gave her a soft kiss on the mouth, while his left hand stroked her left shoulder.</p><p><b></b>After they had finished the kiss Sasami smiled from her position at the stove and wiggled a finger at them. "You two are naughty, you know that?" the blue haired girl said teasingly.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist gave his girlfriend a mischievous smile. "What do you think, honey? Does she want one too?" he asked fake-innocently and with a thoughtful expression.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi returned the smile in kind. It was so good to see her Ranma act so carefree. Thus she decided to play along. Besides it was good to give in to her own mischievous nature and here she did not have to pretend to be the oblivious person she pretended to be at home. Here she could act as she was. "Maybe she feels left out. I guess there is only one way to find out, love."</p><p><b></b>As soon as a wickedly smirking Ranma set himself in motion into Sasami's direction the little Princess shrieked and bolted from the room, while Kasumi and Ranma were united in helpless laughter once Ranma had ceased his attempts to follow Sasami.</p><p><b></b>It felt so good to give into ones mischievous nature without having to fear repercussions like in Nerima. And Sasami's face had simply been too funny. With a smile Ranma sat down at the table and began his breakfast while Kasumi took over Sasami's position at the stove in order to finish the next round of pancakes.</p><p><b></b>A minute or so later Katsuhito entered the room, wearing a confused expression. He was shortly followed by Tenchi, who looked just as confused. "What the hell was that?" he silently mumbled to himself. "Strange..."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded. "The behaviour in this house gets stranger and stranger. Oh, good morning, you two."</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi smiled at each other; the young woman had just finished serving them pancakes and was sitting beside her beloved who was still busy stuffing his face. The two curse victims shared a look; they knew with a high probability just who Katsuhito and Tenchi had encountered. "Good morning, Tenchi. Good morning Grandfather Katsuhito." they said in unison. "Was there anything out of the ordinary?" Kasumi asked with a straight face that Ranma admired and envied to equal parts. Obviously he should never play poker against his girlfriend, or he'd become a pauper. Rapidly.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito shook his head to indicate that it was nothing important. "It was just that Sasami came running from the room as I was about to enter it. And she had a pretty scared expression on her face."</p><p><b></b>Now Ranma could not hold the laughter in any more. After he had gasped for breath he looked at Katsuhito with a smirk. "It was just a practical joke we played on her. She saw us kissing and called us naughty, and thus we played her and let it seem so as if I wanted to give her a kiss too. Sorry 'bout this."</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto Priest nearly fell over laughing. At any rate, he had to sit down and held his sides. As had Tenchi. "Heh heh, that serves her right. She just loves to catch people doing something 'naughty' as she calls it, and then she teases them with it. Excellent how you turned the tables on her. That was quick thinking, buddy. And I'm sure she'll have calmed down fast enough and will realise that you only played her." the young man said.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. Katsuhito, Tenchi, Kasumi, he and Ayeka plus Ryoko, who had joined them a while later, finished their breakfast talking about what Ranma had told them yesterday. And for the first time since long Ryoko and Ayeka were not fighting over Tenchi, as each woman was presently busy planning how to torture a certain panda. Maybe they should ask Washu for some more elaborate torture manuals? Considering her well of knowledge and her access to information that should be easy…</p><p><b></b>Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko and Katsuhito were however suitably impressed when Ranma explained some of the techniques he had learned in detail, and especially Washu, who had joined them for a cup of tea listened with interest. Her resolve grew. She had to get Ranma into her lab. And she was sure that she had the right bait to do so.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had looked very interested when she had promised them to take a look at their curses to see if she could do anything to help them, and she'd love to do it as it presented her genius mind with a challenge. The other data she'd collect during the examination was of course absolutely secondary. Of course.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko's resolve also grew. She'd have to get Ranma into a real sparring match instead of a brawl, and she'd love to fight him/her at full power once again. If what Ryo-Ohki had told her was true, and her cabbit had never been wrong before Ranma would be able to take what she could dish out; including all the other tricks and techniques she had in store. And if she had read Ranma correctly, the youth would not refuse a real sparring match. Too bad that they'd both been too tired to engage in one yesterday.</p><p><b></b>Finally Ranma looked up from the remains of his breakfast and clasped into his hands. "So, now I'll take a shower with the soap and lock myself. From now on three months as a girl. Say bye-bye to Ranma. Soon you'll have three months of Ránmā."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded. "I'll do the same. Soon you'll have to call me Yoshiro. You can take the shower first, love. I'll remain at the table." she said with an encouraging smile.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist smiled back at his girlfriend. "That is a nice offer, Kas-chan, but right now, <i>you</i> are the lady. So you get to use the shower first."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi was about to say that they had more than one shower, but Washu was faster. "Oh Ranma, that would be the perfect opportunity for us to take a look at your curse before you lock yourself. I am quite certain that the curse will behave differently while locked. And it would be illogical to waste three months of possible research. The only thing I have to do is to examine you in both forms. From the data I could extract I would soon be able to tell you if it is possible to remove the curse completely or if I am at least able to improve your situation at all. Imagine, maybe it is not even necessary to get used to your alternate forms if I can cure you. But don't get your hopes up just yet, it might be as your friend Cologne said. Maybe there is <i>really</i> no cure. But isn't it worth a try?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>From the gleam that had appeared in Ranma's eyes everyone could tell that Washu had pushed just the right buttons. And Tenchi began to pray for his poor friend. Another one lost to the clutches of Washu and her lab of doom. How sad! Ranma's answer only served to confirm his fears. "Okay, Lil' Washu. It's worth a shot. Let's go to your lab."</p><p><b></b>The grin that appeared on Washu's face could only be described as ecstatic. She <i>had</i> managed to convince Ranma! Little Washu barely suppressed insane scientist laughter # 127 and limited herself to a pleased grin. "Then come and follow me, Ranma. I promise it won't hurt." <b>'Much.'</b> she added mentally.</p><p><b></b>Ranma turned to Kasumi and gave her a kiss, while everyone else had shuddered. Ryoko shook her head sadly. And again another victim was lead up to the gallows… eh, into her mother's lab. "Maybe you should wait until we have the results, Kas-chan. It might be that there ain't no need to lock ourselves. Wouldn't it be great to be uncursed again?" Ranma asked.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded. "Although I don't mind the curse that much any more it <i>would</i> be nice. I'll wait."</p><p><b></b>Washu smiled slyly. "Maybe it would be a good idea if I could take a look at your curse after I'm through with Ranma. You know, to have some comparative data."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko shot her a look that clearly said 'Be satisfied with one victim and leave it at that.' which was countered by Washu with a 'Who? Me? I'm only trying to help here.'</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo sibling whereas nodded. "That might be a good idea, Washu-chan. I'll be waiting here."</p><p><b></b>The diminutive scientist nodded and set herself in motion towards her lab-entrance. Ranma blew his girlfriend another kiss and followed Washu, unsure of what to expect. Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko looked after Ranma, hoping that he/she would still be the same after the exam…</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed youth followed Washu to another section of the basement, asking himself where in this giant complex that was the Masaki house it could be. As far as he knew, the house had never housed a lab before, and the way Washu had talked about it the lab seemed to be quite big.</p><p><b></b>But <i>where</i> was it? It couldn't be in the cellar, he knew that the cellar was not big enough. Suddenly he was raised from his musings when Washu stopped right before an unassuming looking door. "That? <i>That</i> leads to your lab? But... but we're in the basement! How can your lab be in the <i>basement</i>?"</p><p><b></b>Washu just smirked and opened the door. What appeared was something that looked like a portal. A black portal. "You must learn one thing in this household, Ranma. As with our true age, nothing is what it appears to be."</p><p><b></b>"Umm... what <i>is</i> this and where does it lead?" he asked worriedly.</p><p><b></b>Smirking continued. "This is one of my inventions. I could bore you with scientific details you would probably not understand, but I'll spare you. Now step through the portal. It is not dangerous."</p><p><b>'<i>Not</i> dangerous?'</b> Ranma thought, <b>'What with my luck I can end up everywhere in the universe. Knowing my luck I'll probably appear in the bedroom of Kodachi. Yeah, that's <i>exactly</i> what I'd need. Kodachi chasing her Ranma-sama. #Shudder#'</b></p><p><b></b>But as Ranma Saotome didn't fear nothing he stepped bravely though the portal, and into what he thought, his doom. What he did not expect was to reappear in a large multi-story room with trees. He'd expected a lot, but <i>not</i> to land in something right out of a sci-fi movie.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked around and whistled appreciatively. This place was <i>huge</i>! Alone the room he had appeared in impressed him immensely with its width and openness. He looked around to look for the door, but it had apparently disappeared. Odd.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly Washu appeared before him. The diminutive scientist had stood in the background and had smiled a silent smile as Ranma had taken in the sight. It was always upraising when someone admired your work. "Glad that you like it, Ranma. But you have seen nothing yet. This is just the entry level of my lab, alongside with my primary workspace. It is also the only place from where we can exit the lab. And the whole lab-complex is a lot bigger than just that here. But from here within the lab and only from here I can create doors into every area of my lab." she said and just did that.</p><p><b></b>On the opposite wall of the room another unassuming door appeared apparently out of nowhere. Ranma was quite awed and not a little curious. "How did ya do that? And where does this door lead?"</p><p><b></b>Washu smirked. "It would be too complicated to explain the working principles of quantum mechanics and subspace engineering and how I used my genius to apply their use to suit my ends to you. As for where this door leads... well, to the medical wing of my lab. If you'd follow me."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth boggled. Quantum-whazzit? Subspace-what? That was decidedly too high for him. He had not come this far in Physics until now, and he doubted that he would <i>ever</i> proceed far enough to grasp the concepts Washu was obviously applying to suit her needs.</p><p><b></b>Shrugging he did what Washu had asked of him and followed her through the door. He stepped into the vortex, and moments later he appeared in another room. A room that very much looked like the sickbay from one of those sci-fi series.</p><p><b></b>Washu smirked slightly when she noticed his look. "I have redecorated a bit, and I'm quite proud of the outcome."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded absently as he looked over the medical section. What he saw really seemed to originate from a sci-fi movie. To see equipment like that in reality was awesome an unreal. In an awed whisper he said "Man, this place is awesome! Just like it was taken right out of one of those gaijin sci-fi series!" he exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Little Washu smiled. "I'm glad that you like it. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to start the examination. I also have some other projects ongoing which I need to supervise."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth nodded. "I agree. The sooner this is over the better. I never liked exams much."</p><p><b></b>The scientist smiled. Who in his right mind <i>did</i> like exams when one was the one being examined? The cursed martial artist was a treasure. Too bad that he was already taken. "I understand, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>Ranma gathered his courage and looked at Washu. "Okay, let's get this over with."</p><p><b></b>The scientist nodded, and Ranma noticed that she had already examination gloves covering her hands. The cursed martial artist gulped, and with that the examination began.</p><p><b></b>Washu's examination of his male form took quite some time, and Ranma had the slight suspicion that she was examining more than just his curse; the prodding and probing he endured felt downright unpleasant from time to time. But he had to trust Washu, after all, the diminutive scientist was apparently the only one who could help him and Kasumi regarding their curses.</p><p><b></b>Then the examination was finally over, and Ranma got up from the thing Washu had called a bio-bed. But the examination was far from over. "Ranma, now I need to examine your female form." she said, and Ranma nodded; he had expected as much.</p><p><b></b>Washu pulled a cup of water apparently out of nowhere, and upended the cold liquid over Ranma's head, triggering the change. Naturally the whole change was captured by the multiple sensors and scanners Washu had installed in the medical section of her lab.</p><p><b></b>Satisfied Washu nodded. "Now please lay down on the bio-bed again." she said, and Ranma did just that. "By the way, have you ever had a full gynaecological or breast examination in your female form before?"</p><p><b></b>Talk about the big guns at point-blank-range. Ranma nearly leapt five feet up from the bio-bed and came to sit on the edge of the bio-bed again, panting and chalk-white, unconsciously clutching her breasts. "W... what? B.. breast exam? Gynawhat?" the confused girl asked.</p><p><b></b>Washu sighed. Apparently her mother had not covered these topics when she had given the 'talk' to Ranma. <b>'Why me?'</b> she thought to herself. "Ranma," she began in a soothing but professional tone, "in order to exclude the possibility of cancer or other serious problems a female has to have regular examinations of her body. Especially of the breasts and the ovarian system. I know from my scans that your body is one-hundred percent female, right down to the DNA. In other words, you, Ranma-chan, have a fully functional female body. And you need to make sure that everything is okay. To this end you'll <i>need</i> these examinations sometime in the near future, even if you should be unwilling to do so right now. I have the necessary equipment, but I can understand if you don't want to do it right now. Maybe you'd be more comfortable with a local gynaecologist as it would be more anonymous."</p><p><b></b>Ranma still boggled. But slowly she could see that those examinations would be necessary if Washu found no way to remove the curse. "I understand, Washu-chan. But could we first find out if you are able to remove the curse? Then all this stuff wouldn't be necessary." <b>'Which would relieve me loads. That gyna-something did not sound good…'</b></p><p><b></b>The redheaded scientist nodded. "Sure, Ranma-chan. I'll begin the scans now. Just lean back and relax, it should not take too long."</p><p><b></b>Ranma-chan nodded and leant back onto the bio-bed. And really, it did only take half an hour to get the scan results thanks to Washu's superb technological wonders. The genius scientist studied the results, and from what Ranma-chan could see of her face she did not look optimistic. "Hmm, from the data I have gathered about this curse I can say one thing: it is the most complex coding I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot in my over 20,000 years. I am sorry, Ranma-chan, but even <i>I</i> won't be able to remove the curse. And I don't see any hope that it will ever be possible. This curse really approaches magic and is technologically nearly not explainable. What might be possible is to alter the trigger of the curse. I noticed that these areas of the coding are not as complex. But I can not promise you anything. To evaluate the data completely will take some time. But one thing is definite. There <i>is</i> no cure. You will always be a half-girl, until the end of your life. Sorry, Ranma-chan."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded. She had expected something like that. It would simply have been too good to be true. No, she had to accept the reality. She was now a girl and would be a girl for the half of the rest of her life. What Washu had said made it definite and crushed her last hopes and delusions to become fully male again.</p><p><b></b>But even despite her knowledge that the curse would be with her forever, she was still not convinced that she was indeed as much female as male, even though this concept became stronger, ever so slowly. "Thanks, Washu-chan. Thanks for trying. That it might be possible to change the trigger is at least something. It would be a big help if the water-magnet part could be removed at least, if changing the trigger ain't possible. But I'm sure you'll find a way. Thank you again, Washu-chan." Ranma-chan said, got up and gave Washu a hug.</p><p><b></b>The diminutive scientist was surprised at first, but then returned the hug with a smile. "You're welcome, Ranma-chan. But don't forget, now you <i>will</i> have to get those exams. They are very important for a woman, and you'll be one for the half of the rest of your life. So you got to treat this female body of yours good. Ne, Ranma-chan?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth nodded. "Yes. And I'll think about the stuff with the exams, Washu-chan. Can we get back now? I'd like to take that shower. Time to face my femininity."</p><p><b></b>Washu nodded, and seconds later a door once more appeared out of nowhere. Ranma whistled. "Can you do that everywhere in the house?" she asked curiously.</p><p><b></b>The other redhead shook her head. "No, right now just inside my lab. Tenchi, the big meanie, won't let me do it for the rest of the house. He says this way the girls would have it much easier to surprise him. I'd say one girl-surprise or the other wouldn't hurt him." <b>'Especially if it's my daughter who surprises him...' </b>she added mentally.</p><p><b></b>Ranma giggled. She could clearly imagine Tenchi's face if Ryoko suddenly came out of a door that had not been there seconds before, ready to jump his bones. Too funny!</p><p><b></b>Shaking her head in hilarity Ranma followed Washu towards the door, and both women used it to return to the entry-level of the lab from where Washu created a door to the living room.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi and Sasami who were the only ones left in the house and who had been waiting for their return looked up from what they were doing when they heard a door being shut, and the next thing the two saw were two redheads.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo upended a convenient glass of water over her head, and a second later he was at Ranma's side. "I take that there is no cure, love, else you would not be in your alternate form."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled a lop-sided smile. "Razor-sharp combined, Sherlock Tendo. No, there is no cure, and I'll be half-and-half for the rest of my life. Washu's examination only made it final. But I'll live with it, and I'll do my best to enjoy being a girl for the next three months."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled and embraced his girlfriend. He did not know why but it just felt better to hold his Ranma in male form, that's why he'd become male some seconds ago. It was simply easier to comfort his girlfriend in this form and the sensations of holding Ranma-chan in this form were much… nicer. "That is the spirit, my love. And<i> I</i> will do my best to enjoy being a boy for these three months. Lil' Washu, do you need to examine me too now that we know that the curse can not be removed?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>The scientist stroked her chin. "It was not possible to remove the curse in Ranma's case which was interconnected with the fact that she has had the curse for so long. Maybe the situation is different in your case due to the fact that you have not had the curse for a long time as of now. In my opinion an exam of you would not hurt." <b>'Much.'</b> she added once more. Washu hoped that this had been enough to convince the other curse victim. She'd be damned if she'd pass up such an opportunity.</p><p><b></b>To her relief the woman-turned-man nodded. He did not mind the curse much any more but why not. "Okay, Lil' Washu. I'll be back soon, Ranma-chan. Will you wait with the shower until then?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl nodded. "Of course. I'll busy myself with some more breakfast, Ka-kun. Maybe I'll even look what the others are doing… but those pancakes do smell good!" she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>The woman-turned-man shook his head. "Your stomach is a bottomless pit, love." he said with a smile, fully knowing that she'd probably engage herself fully in an all-you-can-eat contest to beat her own records for the time of his absence.</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded. "And this pit is looking forward to be filled. Preferably with Sasami's fine cuisine, seeing as you're on vacation." she said with an impish grin.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko shook his head in mirth and gave his girlfriend a kiss; then he followed Washu-chan into the recesses of her lab.</p><p><b></b>An hour and many breakfast items on Ranmas part later Kasumi-otoko finally re-entered the living room through the same door the two redheads had used before. Ranma could see from his expression that he had not had more luck than she and that he was in male form was a dead give-away. Obviously the curse could not be removed; but oddly enough, Kasumi did not seem too sad about it. "No luck?" she asked to confirm her suspicions.</p><p><b></b>The brown-haired man shook his head. "No, Ra-chan. Even in my case my body was already too saturated with curse-magic, or as Lil' Washu called it 'chaotic coding'. Lil' Washu has no way of removing the curse as the 'chaotic coding of my curse' is as complex as in your case. She said that she'd love to take a look at a freshly cursed Jusenkyo victim to verify if the coding is this complex from the start or not. Fact is that I'll always be a half-man for the rest of my life and that I'll have to live with it."</p><p><b></b>He had just finished the sentence when he was being hugged by a certain redhead. "I'm sorry, Ka-kun." she said sadly.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko ruffled her silky hair and smiled down on her. "What for, Ra-chan? It's not your fault. Besides as long as the love of my life changes alongside me it's a lot easier to bear." he said and evoked a pleased smile from Ranma; a two-minute lip-lock followed that was only interrupted by the necessity to come up for air. Both curse victims looked lovingly at each other and Ranma leant into her taller boyfriend.</p><p><b></b>He was right; as long as they changed together it was a lot easier to bear. Should she feel guilty now that she'd secretly hoped that the curse could not be removed in Kasumi's case? She had to admit to herself that she <i>had</i> feared that Kasumi could become uncursed which would leave her alone again.</p><p><b></b>Finally she had someone who understood her and what she was going through on a regular basis and she honestly didn't know how she would have reacted if Kasumi could've been cured. Sure, she felt guilty for feeling this way but she could not help to feel relieved. Maybe she'd confess her feeling to her love later on.</p><p><b></b>Seeing the introspective mood of his girlfriend the cursed Tendo decided to get her out of her brooding. "How about we take a certain shower now, Ra-chan?"</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed youth nodded. Then a wicked gleam entered her eyes. The others did not have to know, but maybe they could try it again how it was to change under a shower, together. It had felt quite good the first time. "Yes, Ka-kun. Let's take the shower." she said and made her way out of the living room. "Later!" she called towards Sasami who had been busy with one kitchen-duty or the other.</p><p><b></b>"Yes, Ranma-chan, later. And don't do something naughty!" the little Princess exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked back with a look that said 'Who? Me?', smirked and went upstairs. Kasumi-otoko went and followed her, and found that Ranma was already waiting for him at the door to the bathroom. "I have already placed the soap in the shower and if you want to you can go first. Or we could go in together…" she said with a suggestive wink.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko blushed and shook his head. "That's not a good idea, Ra-chan. In spite of how far we have progressed in our relationship it would be improper to shower together." he said earnestly. Then his face changed into a smile. "However, that might and will change in the future…" he finished suggestively at seeing her disappointed expression.</p><p><b></b>The redhead smiled back instantly. "I sure do hope so, Ka-kun." she answered and leant forward. Kasumi-otoko smiled and soon the two cursed individuals found themselves in a lip-lock. The cursed Tendo as well as the cursed Saotome enjoyed the kiss very much and both had to resist the urge to go any further. Kasumi-otoko knew the exact physiological reasons for that but they had sworn that they would wait with the naughty bit until they had at least met one of the conditions they had set.</p><p><b></b>Finally the kiss ended; with a smile Kasumi-otoko went into the bathroom. Inwardly Ranma had to fight the urge to follow her love but she knew that it was just too early. Granted, they had seen each other naked in the furo several times in the past but she had never seen <i>him</i> naked. And further, Kasumi had never seen her male form naked either. No, that was something they would limit for the bedroom for when the time was right.</p><p><b></b>Inside the bathroom Kasumi-otoko locked the door. Not so much as to keep his love out but to keep anyone else out. Slowly he disrobed and placed his clothes on the stool. Finally naked he paused to view himself in the full-body mirror. He had slowly gotten used to the male body and it sure helped that he was indeed handsome.</p><p><b></b>He was really well built, that he could say about himself without boasting. His stomach was flat and well-muscled and approached a washboard stomach due to all the training in the past weeks. Surveying himself in the mirror Kasumi-otoko nodded to himself; he was very satisfied with the muscle-tone of his male body. It was really well muscled but not overly so; he had an attractive face and expressive brown eyes, not unlike his grandfather on the maternal side that he only knew from pictures. In short, he was what even his sisters would describe as a hunk. It had been irritating at first but from a diplomatic question he knew that it did not hurt that he was very well hung.</p><p><b></b>Slowly he had come to accept that this body was also Kasumi Tendo and what Elder Cologne had told her about the curse had really helped. It had been the Elder who had clarified that it was not the body that counted but the person inside. And even in male form he was still Kasumi Tendo.</p><p><b></b>Without anyone hindering him as would have been likely back at home he had already nearly accepted the curse completely. Being male had also certain benefits such as greater strength and reach and harder skin. It had been quite hard to get used to pee while standing and missing out on the monthlies for three months or more would be something he'd have to get used to. However he could very well do without a migraine and flushes for that amount of time.</p><p><b></b>And being together with Ranma had made everything so much easier. He'd never have thought that getting cursed would have so many benefits but the greatest had been that he had been able to act upon his feelings and show them to Ranma.</p><p><b></b>It had been the happiest moment of his/her life when Ranma had reciprocated the love he felt for the other curse victim. The last two weeks had been like walking on clouds and the feeling of a million butterflies in the stomach each time he looked at his/her love was indescribable and endlessly nice.</p><p><b></b>However, before he'd lock himself he'd have to say good-bye to his female side properly. Thus the cursed Tendo went over to the sink and turned the warm water tap on. From experience with the curse he knew that just holding his hand into the stream of warm water would be enough to trigger the change.</p><p><b></b>Looking into the mirror he did just that and moments later he noticed the tingling sensation that accompanied the change. Seconds later her female form had been restored and she surveyed what the full mirror to the other side of the room presented her.</p><p><b></b>With a satisfied smile she nodded. She was still as beautiful as she had been before she had received the curse. Slowly she shook her head. Who would have known that a now 17 year old young man named Ranma Saotome who was cursed to become a girl would have had such an impact on her life? Probably nobody. But she was glad about what had happened for it had led to true love for her.</p><p><b></b>From a scientific point of view their relationship was also bound to be more fulfilled than those of other couples. Moments later Kasumi blushed at her naughty thoughts but as she had already thought about having kids with Ranma sex was no longer a foreign concept for her. She knew that she wanted to do the 'naughty' with Ranma; it was only a question of time and finances.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was the one for her, for both sides of her, which she had found proven in the last two weeks. What had been love had blossomed into a burning love, a love she had never felt for anyone before in her life. For lack of terms to describe it properly it was like she was burning inside but at the same time the love she felt for Ranma gave her nourishment.</p><p><b></b>With a smile she realised that she had tried to grasp the concept of love scientifically. She had read every bit of information she could get about her chosen field of interest, medicine. Technically she knew that love was a process activated and controlled by hormones.</p><p><b></b>Lately she had read a definition for love on the net; according to that love was 'the affinity experienced between two people who are naturally able and willing to tune into one another's emotional, intellectual, and physical states - and respond to them in a nurturing and a stimulating way'. The theory paled verily in comparison to reality, however. Being in love was the greatest experience she had made as of yet and there were just no words to describe the state she was in.</p><p><b></b>An ever bigger smile graced her face as she entered the shower cubicle. True to her word Ranma had indeed placed the soap in the shower. Elder Cologne had advised to apply the soap after the skin had gotten wet already, like anyone would handle a normal soap. That was no problem as she had to change into her male form anyway.</p><p><b></b>Saying good bye to womanhood for three or more months Kasumi switched the shower on. She had adjusted the setting to medium-warm which she gradually changed from warm to cold, triggering the change. Then he turned the water off and applied the improved waterproof soap to his whole body.</p><p><b></b>Seconds later he felt an odd tingling, not unlike that when the change occurred but stronger. Suddenly the cream and wax coat from the soap disappeared and the tingling got stronger still until it finally stopped. "Hmm, it seems to be complete." he muttered to himself. "Cologne hasn't said anything but I better wait for a minute or so. Better safe than sorry."</p><p><b></b>Not one to waste time Kasumi-otoko used the time to clasp his toe- and fingernails. After all, it would not do for a man to have overly long nails and once he was a she again they could always regrow. He'd also have to do something about his hair as his ponytail held by one hair-band was a tad bit too long. Sure that clasping the nails had taken more than one minute he entered the shower cubicle once more. "Good, now to test it." he said to himself and turned on the warm water.</p><p><b></b>The water showered him, but no change occurred. He gradually turned the heat up until it became nearly unbearable. Still no change. "Very nice. It seems to be working. Now to my love." he said and exited the shower.</p><p><b></b>Then he grabbed a towel and clothed. It was a good thing that the Chinese pants and the shirt were virtually unisex but now that he would be a man for three months at least the first thing they had to do was to go on a shopping trip to buy themselves some decent clothing.</p><p><b></b>Finally fully clothed Kasumi-otoko exited the bathroom. The sight he came upon was something he should have expected from his Ranma but it was nevertheless funny. To keep herself occupied while he had been busy in the bathroom his love had engaged in some light training and was currently doing some vertical push-ups on one finger.</p><p><b></b>However once she sensed him she instantly sprang to her feet, a look of deep curiosity on her face. "Did it work?" she asked with big blue eyes.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled. "Yes, it did. I fear from now on you'll have a full-time boyfriend for the next three months."</p><p><b></b>Ranma pretended to be on the verge of fainting. "Oh no! However shall I survive this?" she exclaimed theatrically.</p><p><b></b>The now locked Tendo lunged for her. "C'mere you!" he exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko lunged at her to try to tackle her down and tickle her mercilessly but Ranma evaded that fate at first. However Kasumi-otoko had a greater reach than her and finally managed to tackle her down. "Tendo Ultimate Tickle attack!" he exclaimed and attacked her sides mercilessly. It was something he had last done as a she many years back and it just felt good. He couldn't believe on how much he had missed out in her/his former existence as a housewife and he vowed to catch up on it, together with his Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Soon said Ranma was squirming on the ground in helpless laughter due to the fact that her sides were a lot more ticklish while female and conceded defeat after some time. "Stop! I #giggle# give up! #gasp# You're #guffaw# too good!" she exclaimed with tears in her eyes from laughter.</p><p><b></b>Ultimately albeit reluctantly Kasumi-otoko stopped and received his winners kiss after Ranma had caught her breath. Theatrically she exclaimed "Oh no, I, Ranma Saotome have lost! Whatever shall happen now?" which send the two into fits of laughter. It also showed that Ranma was finally able to relax and have some fun; a great progress on her part, in Kasumis opinion.</p><p><b></b>Soon both cursed individuals were sitting on the floor, Ranma leant into Kasumi-otoko. He softly stroked her hair, a smile on his face. "You know, had someone told me some time ago that I'd lock myself as a man for three months I'd have had them committed to a good asylum. But now that I have you and because of you it all is not so bad any more. I have understood that we are now both man and woman and that probably till the day we die. I will do my best to learn how to be a man and I want to be there for you. Ranma-chan, I love you."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Saotome youth snuggled even deeper into Kasumi-otokos body with a big smile on her face. She had never experienced such unconditional love before. Her mother had begun to show such love to her in the past three months but it had been a motherly love, and that was different from the love Kasumi held for her.</p><p><b></b>In the past two weeks when she had been a girl on and off, but especially during the time in Oume she had felt just how good it felt if you had someone who cared for you, who protected you and offered unconditional love. She loved Kasumi more than her life, but to her misery she could not voice it as of yet. "I know what you mean, Ka-kun." she said, and alone the use of the pet-name with the male-suffix should tell Kasumi what she felt for him. "The same goes for me. I'd have thought anyone who would have told me that <i>I</i> would lock myself as a girl for three months completely raving bonkers. But you hit the dot, because of you it is not so bad. I'm bad with words, but… the heck!" she exclaimed and pressed a hard kiss on his mouth.</p><p><b></b>A kiss that was soon returned in kind and intensity. Kasumi had indeed understood what Ranma wanted to tell him. She loved him but was as of yet unable to voice it. Genma had it too deeply ingrained in her so that she could not admit her innermost feelings, her love as of yet. But together they would work on it and he was sure that they would achieve victory over the panda and his teachings. He also hoped dearly that he would maybe get good enough in the Art after a crash-course Ranma style to deal out some just and deserved punishment to Genma. For crippling Ranma thusly he deserved to be sold to a zoo, preferably as a female panda for a breeding program!</p><p><b></b>What he did not understand was that Nodoka put up with him or why. Genma Saotome did not deserve such a fine wife. He just did not deserve someone like auntie! He had really come to like Nodoka after she had been convinced that her views and ideas for Ranma were hurting her child more deeply than any other human being could ever achieve, her various rivals, suitors and enemies included. He had to suppress the urge to scowl as he thought about how confused and hurt Ranma had been because of that and only kissing the life out of Ranma and stroking her silky red hair served to take his mind away from those thoughts.</p><p><b></b>It had taken some hard realities to convince Nodoka but now he would be glad to call her his mother-in-law one time. As for Genma, maybe Nodoka could be convinced that a panda-breeding program would indeed be the right choice for her idiot and hopefully soon-to-be-ex-husband.</p><p><b></b>When the kiss ended Kasumi-otoko helped Ranma to her feet and embraced her in a hug. "Now go so that we can go shopping, love." he said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma raised her hands towards the heavens and rolled her eyes in mock-horror. "Argh, the shopping virus strikes again! Maybe I can get rid of it with some cold water…" she jested.</p><p><b></b>Her love aimed a playful punch at her but Ranma evaded with a giggle. Then she strode towards the bathroom, blew her love a kiss and closed the door. Ranma went through the same procedure as Kasumi had, even including the melancholy part. But like Kasumi she admitted that it was necessary and soon she had herself locked. Like Kasumi she took precautions and waited one minute for the soap to latch on.</p><p><b></b>During this time she engaged in some light training to kill the wait and once she had found out that the soap did indeed work she towelled herself off, dressed and left the bathroom. With a lopsided grin she greeted her love. "Well, now you have three months of a full-time girlfriend ahead of you. Will you be able to handle that?"</p><p><b></b>His answer was a smile and the two were just about to engage in yet another snogging session when suddenly an explosion rocked the compound. Screams could be heard and in a flash Ranma ran downstairs to investigate with her love hot on her heels. In the kitchen she saw a confused and scared Mihoshi and an oddly spaced-out Sasami. "You stay in here and keep safe!" she stated in a commanding voice and the blonde Galaxy Police officer nodded. Whatever it was that was attacking them Mihoshi doubted that she'd prove useful in the fight.</p><p><b></b>Then Ranma caught sight of Katsuhito who entered the room with his sword drawn. "Don't worry about them, Ranma. I'll protect Sasami and Mihoshi with my life. But your speed and skill are needed outside."</p><p><b></b>That stopped Ranma dead in her tracks. "Do you know what's happening?"</p><p><b></b>The Shinto priest nodded. "Little Washu gained some intel on our attacker before it disabled our sensor-array. That's also where your senses come in. If the data is right the attacker is a disguised Android apparently sent by an old foe of us though we have no idea how. Washu also warned us that it has some defences to counter our Juraian powers; that's why you're so important. But more to that later. I'll protect the house with everything I have; please go and help the others."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded and sprinted towards the door. She nearly ordered her love to stay behind with the others but Kasumi-otoko was not so easy to convince and followed her.</p><p><b></b>She ran outside and what she saw made her boggle. Damn it, was she seeing double or what? Why the heck were there two Ryokos?</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group. I enjoy reading your comments, and the suggestions you all make will help to make this story even better.</p><p>If you find anything illogical that might have created a plot-hole or anything else that is wrong, let me know and I'll fix it.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
