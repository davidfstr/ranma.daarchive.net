No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 3: What are your feelings, Ranma? </b></p><p><b></b>After this incident things really started to look up for a time. Akane had obviously gotten a good tongue-lashing from her sisters for her newest stunt, and it showed. Now the youngest Tendo made at least an effort to curb her jealousy and anger, and even if she did not succeed all the time, it was a begin. That Akane got her temper somewhat better under control might also have to do with the fact that Kasumi had begun to apply calming herbs to her morning tea without her notice…</p><p><b></b>Ranma continued his efforts to be nice to Akane and ignored the two old farts and their ramblings altogether, although they were still grating on his nerves with their harebrained schemes to push Akane and him together. Akane did not clobber him as often as she used to, and that was always a good thing in Ranma's book. Then one day...</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed youth just came back from a brawl with the myopic duck-boy, and he was hungry like a legion of locusts. Beating Mousse had been easy, he had just knocked him unconscious and had dropped him off at the Nekohanten. But he had already been <i>very</i> hungry before that. "Tadaima!" he greeted, then looked around. No sign of his dad or Mr. Tendo. Odd.</p><p><b></b>"Hello Ranma." Kasumi greeted with a smile. She had seen Ranma's look scanning the room, and knew what he thought. "Father and Uncle have left and will be back late. They said they had something to celebrate."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. Trust the old farts to celebrate that he and Akane got somewhat along. If he were not really careful, the two old idiots would probably plan the next wedding. Which would probably get bombed too. "Okay by me. When is lunch, Kasumi? I'm totally wiped out!"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi had presented warding signs when he had mentioned the L-word, but Ranma had apparently not noticed. Thus fate took its course. "Oh Ranma, I'm so glad to hear that!" called a familiar voice from the kitchen. A voice that had no place in a kitchen at all, nor had the rest of her, as far as he was concerned.</p><p><b>'Drat!'</b> Ranma thought. <b>'Me 'n my big mouth. I'm doomed! And if I tell her ta try her own cooking before serving it ta me she'll clobber me for sure! If I say I don't wanna try it she'll clobber me 'n if I try it and nearly die she'll clobber me too. Just great!'</b></p><p><b></b>Actually, Kasumi and his mother had done a really good job to keep Akane out of kitchen up till now. Both women knew that they would <i>never</i> get Akane to try her own cooking before serving it to Ranma, as Akane was much too convinced that her cooking tasted heavenly.</p><p><b></b>Or she subconsciously knew how dreadful her cooking really was and would claim all the louder how heavenly it was to thrust away her subconsciousness. Anyway, every time Kasumi or Nodoka had tried to get her to taste her own cooking in the past she had refused with the argument that she was absolutely sure it tasted heavenly, so why should she try it. There was just no reason for that in her opinion. And it seemed that her attitude was unchangeable.</p><p><b></b>Thus Kasumi and Nodoka had decided to keep Akane out of the kitchen and had used her to run errands. Or they had busied her otherwise. The logic was simple. If Akane had no time and occasion to cook, no toxic-food-incident could happen.</p><p><b></b>And Ranma had soon noticed that his mother was as set on making this work as he was, because she, with Kasumi's help, had done a <i>very</i> good job to keep the youngest Tendo sister out of the kitchen applying this logic. He had seldom seen his mother this determined in the months he had come to know her. Hmm, obviously something had gone wrong today. Could have to do with his mothers' absence, he mused.</p><p><b></b>Had Akane, whom Kasumi alone obviously had not managed to keep out of the kitchen, been able to hear his thoughts, a malleting would have followed. Which might have been the more painless procedure. But as Akane was no telepath fate took its inevitable course and the youngest Tendo daughter came out of the kitchen, baking gloves covering her hands. In her covered hands she was carrying a plate of... something the pigtailed martial artist had dubbed UFO – 'unidentified food object'.</p><p><b></b>Ranma couldn't be sure <i>what</i> the UFO was <i>this</i> time, but he was quite sure that it shouldn't be moving. Or should it? Maybe it was <i>very </i>fresh fish, but somehow the Saotome youth doubted it. And he had never seen food coloured like that before. Akane placed it before him with a smile, and Kasumi gave him a pitying look, but made sure that Akane wouldn't see it else her temper might boil over prematurely at seeing the 'pervert' being friendly with her sister.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth nodded imperceptibly towards Kasumi and braced himself. Feigning a smile at the waiting Akane Ranma nodded, accepting his fate. "Mmmh, I'm hungry!" he said, while adding <b>'Not!'</b> mentally.</p><p><b></b>Then he raised his chopsticks and studied the 'UFO' before him once more. Beside the fact that it was moving, it was dotted with odd green things that he was sure should not belong there. Or anywhere else in the proximity of food for this matter. Inwardly he sighed. Had Akane tried to spice up the food once more?</p><p><b></b>Alas, knowing her talents as a cook, or rather the lack thereof, Ranma was quite sure that the spices (or other substances) Akane had used in creating the UFO were the <i>least</i> he had to worry about. After all, due to Akane's attempts at cooking, Kodachi's attempts at drugging and poisoning him (regarding the form) and Shampoo's application of her herbs, drugs and poisons on a regular basis he had acquired quite the immunity against most poisons. Which came in quite handy at times. Though Ranma would have liked to acquire this immunity in another way, if possible.</p><p><b></b>But <i>whatever</i> it was that was sitting before him on the plate, it had him worried. Very much so. Feeling not unlike a man who was led up to the gallows, Ranma dug into the food. <i>Very</i> hesitantly. As in with a ten-foot pole. <b>'Probably being in a nuclear reactor now instead of being here and trying <i>that</i> wouldn't be as bad...'</b> he thought to himself.</p><p><b></b>He took one bite, making sure to avoid the odd green things, and swallowed. Immediately he regretted it. Kasumi, who was still standing frozen in her position, anxious of what would happen, was witness as Ranma's face suddenly changed colour. First it coloured green, afterwards yellow and then, finally, blue. Then a breath of fire escaped the pig-tailed martial artists' mouth that nearly roasted the table. Ranma's eyes were watering and he ran towards the kitchen sink to wash his mouth out.</p><p><b></b>Akane, on her part, was seething unlike ever before, and the calming effects of the herbs evaporated like a snowball in hell. Here she had been standing in the kitchen hours upon hours, making an effort in being nice to her iinazuke by preparing food for him, food which surely tasted <i>heavenly</i>, she was sure, and he insulted her by behaving like he did. The ungrateful pervert! She would teach him!</p><p><b></b>Red with anger, mallet at the ready she stormed into the kitchen, where Ranma had just finished banishing the vile taste of the 'food' and was currently waving air into his still steaming mouth. He just looked up in time to see the mallet flying towards his head, and then, with a cry of "RANMA NO BAKA!" he was once again launched into the air, landing in the Koi pond.</p><p><b></b>Akane then stomped steaming towards the dojo to work off some stress. The ingrate! How dare he insult her food! <i>Nobody</i> had the right to insult her heavenly food! Soon the sounds of bricks being smashed emerged from the dojo, and a wet Ranma-onna tried to extract herself from the ground of the Koi-pond.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi, who had watched all this, had grimaced as Akane had sent Ranma airborne once more, like so often lately. After having seen Ranma's reaction to the 'food' she had retreated to the kitchen. Not only to check up on the first aid kit, for this was only the pretended reason. Kasumi knew the condition of the first aid kit quite well.</p><p><b></b>The eldest Tendo daughter had sat down on a chair in the kitchen, well knowing that no one was around to see her. Ranma would need some time to recuperate from the very hard blow Akane had dealt out before he, or rather she, would emerge from the pond, and her sister was breaking bricks in the dojo and would do so for quite some time. 'Insults' to food 'cooked' by her never sat well with Akane.</p><p><b></b>She had tried to hold back her tears, but suddenly they came in the blink of an eye and her shoulders quivered as Kasumi began to cry. Not because of this single, isolated incident, but because of the mounting cases that bordered on gross ill-treatment. Ill treatment of a fine young man, and that in the name of the 'Joining of the schools'. Let alone watching all this hurt her, and she could only begin to imagine how much all of it must hurt poor Ranma.</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo daughter cried for a young man who was constantly abused by her younger sister Akane and her own family, only because of a downright foolish agreement made by her father and 'Uncle' Saotome to fulfil <i>their</i> dreams. But who had paused to ask <i>Ranma</i> about his own dreams? <i>His</i> hopes and feelings? If <i>he</i> wanted all this? The saddening answer was: nobody.</p><p><b></b>Another part of her tears was also shed because of her own idiocy. Over a year ago, when Ranma had first arrived at the Tendo Dojo, wet, female and in the company of a giant Panda, she and Nabiki had literally foisted Ranma off at Akane after finding out about his curse. And that faster than Ranma had been able to blink. And Akane had not taken well to it after all her experiences with Tatewaki Kuno and the Hentai Horde. Those experiences had taught her that all boys near her age were perverts who only wanted to grope a feel or worse.</p><p><b></b>So the last thing she had wanted at that time had been to be engaged to a boy her age. And a perverted boy of the same age as her who turned into a girl had been so much worse in Akanes' opinion. For the pervert could peek at a girls´ body anytime he wanted, all that he needed was cold water.</p><p><b></b>Sadly, her little sisters' attitude towards Ranma had not changed in over a year. It was quite obvious to anyone that Ranma was anything but a pervert, and he had proven this many times in the past. Kasumi even doubted that Ranma had had the 'talk'. And what with the sex-ed Furinkan High provided it was more than questionable that Ranma had ever done anything perverted. At even the hint of sexuality Ranma had always been nearly mortally embarrassed. No, he was no pervert, but regardless the evidence, Akane would not believe it.</p><p><b></b>According to her little sister Ranma was always doing perverted things with Shampoo, Ukyo and even Kodachi, and he had to be punished for it. And regardless how much Kasumi had tried, she had not been able to convince her little sister of Ranma's innocence. Or of the theory that her rivals might be trying to use her temper problems against her. Little sisters answer had been the outburst "I have no temper problems!", which had indeed been proof to the contrary, but Akane had not listened to anything of it.</p><p><b></b>Apparently her little sister treated Ranma abiding by the rule guilty until proven otherwise, and guilty in case of doubt. Oddly enough, she seemed to believe others more readily than her own iinazuke, and lately this rang more true than ever. Though Kasumi had no idea why. And lately Akane seemed to give in to her anger and jealousy much easier than ever before, something for which the eldest Tendo daughter had no explanation. Even the herbs she had used had not helped.</p><p><b></b>Sure, Kasumi knew that her little sister had feelings for Ranma, in fact Kasumi was quite sure that she loved him, but she was not showing him anything but contempt, jealousy and anger. And Kasumi knew that it could not go on like this. Ranma would not put up with this forever. She asked herself time and time again from where Ranma was taking his patience, for she figured even she would have run off screaming by now..</p><p><b></b>The eldest of the Tendo sisters for her part had, when her father had announced the engagement, thought that she <i>knew</i> what kind of man she wanted, and she had had her eyes already set on the young, handsome, successful and widely respected doctor, Tofu Ono. A boy who turned into a girl due to a curse and who was rough and uncivilised had not been in the equation.</p><p><b></b>How foolish she had been. She had realised this in the last three months, in which she had come to know Ranma very well. He had told her everything about what had transpired at Jusendo. They had had talks even before Jusendo, and she had often tended to his wounds in the past. Ranma had trusted her and had opened up to her, and after that talk she had vowed that she would give it her best to bring Akane and Ranma together. The young man deserved happiness, as did her youngest sister. And that's why she had decided three months ago that if she could correct Ranma's behaviour and 'foot-in-mouth-problems', Akane and Ranma might just have a chance together.</p><p><b></b>That was why she had begun to tutor him regarding proper behaviour, language and manners and even school subjects. At first the progress had been slow, but after Kasumi had presented this training as a challenge it had been incredible how much Ranma had improved.</p><p><b></b>It was like watching how a caterpillar developed into a butterfly. Add to his improved behaviour that Ranma Saotome was a kind, noble and deeply caring man, if he was not in female form. Then Ranma Saotome was a gentle person. And Ranma had demonstrated his will to sacrifice himself for others at Jusendo, an act of greatness, not only in Kasumi's eyes. Which proved his selflessness. Shampoo had (unsurprisingly) and even though she had been ignored by Ranma constantly praised the pigtailed martial artist for his power and bravery. And it was obvious that Ranma now had Ryogas' respect.</p><p><b></b>Also, Ranma always worried about others before worrying about himself and did not want to hurt them, even if they in return even sought to kill him. Like Mousse, who still tried to kill Ranma to remove the obstacle in his quest to get Shampoos' love. Proof for this could also be found in the situation regarding his so called fiancée brigade. Kasumi had, ever since she had begun working with Ranma, come to realise that he was so reluctant to resolve the mess his own father had created because he did not want to <i>hurt</i> Ukyo and Shampoo.</p><p><b></b>Yes, Ranma worried about others more than about himself and always tried to do the honourable and right thing, despite the fact that it <i>always</i> seemed to fail and come back to haunt him. What good had honour done for him? <b><br/></b>Family honour had trapped him in a nearly unsolvable mess thanks to the actions of his greedy and stupid father, and despite all this Ranma still remained true to his honour. Sometimes Kasumi thought it was the only thing left to him of importance beside his Art.</p><p><b></b>This young man was so driven by honour that he would not even allow father and 'Uncle' Saotome to hurt Grandfather Happosai in his moment of weakness. Ranma was a man who'd never let a friend down, regardless the costs.</p><p><b></b>The promises made by him were of the kind one could trust blindly, for it was known that Ranma always kept word. And how often had he fought for her family to protect the Tendo dojo from danger? The Dojo Destroyer was only one of many examples in that regard. And how often had he saved her youngest sister from a bad fate through risking his own life? Countless times. And how did they thank him? With a mallet to the head, slights to his honour and insults. Oh, and through blaming him for anything that went wrong, regardless if it was Ranma's fault or not. Ranma Saotome, the convenient scapegoat.</p><p><b></b>And why <i>not</i>? It was so easy to blame everything, even ones own faults, on someone else. In this case on Ranma. For by blaming their problems on the Saotome youth <i>they</i> did not have to invest the necessary energy to solve them. But from what Ranma had told her, Ryoga, the lost boy of all people, had discovered that that was not a way to solve ones own problems and faults. He had done so with help, help from Akari, but that was beside the point. Why could her little sister, even with all the help from her, not do the same thing? Maybe because she and even her father had gotten so used to blame Ranma for everything, as it was an easy way to keep a clear conscience and wash their hands of their faults?</p><p><b></b>Granted, the pigtailed martial artist had brought his own bout of chaos with him, but he always gave his utmost to ensure that no one came to harm. And he always succeeded. But still they and foremost Akane blamed him for everything. Kasumi was only glad that things regarding Ryoga were looking up now, and the oldest Tendo daughter was very happy that he had overcome his infatuation with her little sister.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi had nearly squealed with joy when Ranma had related what Ryoga had said, and she was quite sure that they would never see P-chan again in the Tendo Dojo. Sure, Akane would be quite crestfallen when P-chan would not return to her any more, but she'd have to accept it. Ryoga was now happy with Akari, and even though she had hated what Ryoga had done in his cursed form, she was happy for him.</p><p><b></b>It nearly bettered her mood when she remembered what she had said to Akane when her younger sister had asked her if she had seen P-chan lately. Her answer had been "No, Akane, he has probably gotten lost for good and found his luck elsewhere. Maybe it is time to get a new pet, or you could start to be nicer to Ranma. After all, this also needs feelings like love and care."</p><p><b></b>But her sister had only snorted, and she could see in Akane's eyes that she still hoped P-chan would return to her. Though Kasumi knew better. If only Ranma's thoughts and feelings were as important to Akane as her 'pet' P-chan. If only she'd treat <i>Ranma</i> better.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi sighed. It might look funny how Ranma rebounded every time he got hit by Akane's mallet or each time he tried her visibly toxic cooking, like some character out of an Anime show. But she feared the day when Ranma would not spring back up. For this was no Anime show, this was real life, where people <i>stayed </i>dead after they had died. And Kasumi knew that she would not be able to bear it should Ranma die. Especially not if he died because of the thoughtlessness of her own family.</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo daughter continued crying and thought about the situation at the same time. Ever since Tofu Ono had left Nerima, and to be honest even before, Kasumi had ultimately realised that the young doctor would never be able to act normally in her presence. They'd never be able to have a relationship, and like Ono, who had moved away because of it, she had accepted it.</p><p><b></b>Probably that was why she had begun to develop feelings of her own for Ranma after she had overcome her infatuation with the doctor. Because she had sensed another lonely soul, and this lonely soul that was Ranma was constantly under siege by so many different suitors, but in the end, he was ultimately alone, because no one cared for his wishes and dreams. His many suitors only wanted to possess him, to take him as a price. And his feelings and thoughts in the matter were apparently irrelevant.</p><p><b></b>It might have looked great for an outsider how Ranma was constantly chased by all those beautiful women, but Kasumi knew that he felt like a man who was trapped in a golden cage. Trapped due to giri because of his greedy, stupid and irresponsible father. A father who obviously only wanted to enjoy his 'well deserved' retirement, and that at the cost of his sons' happiness.</p><p><b></b>And ever since she had realised just how much more there was to Ranma than met the eye upon first look, she had wished that she could somehow help him. Make it all better for him, show him that there was someone who cared for him and for what he hoped, wished and dreamed. But she had sworn to herself that she would not act on her feelings, not as long as there was a chance for Ranma with Akane. And she would stay true to her own word. She would help Ranma to find his happiness.</p><p><b></b>Even though she had sworn this to herself Kasumi still wished nothing more than to be able to comfort the young man after he had received yet another beating at her sister's hands. Not to comfort him like a mother or sister would do, but like a friend, potentially more. She had hugged Ranma as a friend who comforted another friend many times now, and it had felt so good.</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo sister wanted to tell him that everything would gonna be alright, that the pain and suffering he went through on a daily basis was not in vain and that he should not give up hope. That everything would turn out good in the end.</p><p><b></b>But lately she had seen it in his eyes, the mounting look of hopelessness and despair. He would not put up with all the crap that was heaved upon him for much longer. Little did Kasumi know how true this was, and that Ranma had already taken steps in this regard.</p><p><b></b>Shaking herself out of her musings and wiping her tears away while removing any evidence that she had cried as best as she could, Kasumi saw Ranma-onna staggering into the kitchen, holding her obviously hurting head. That was obviously why it had taken Ranma so long to come out of the pond. She had apparently taken a really hard hit. "Oh my, you should better lie down upstairs, Ranma. You don't look too good. Come, you can lie down on the bed in my room, it is much more comfortable than the futon in yours."</p><p><b></b>All protests coming from Ranma were waved aside by the serenely smiling Kasumi (although she had to force it), and finally Ranma gave in. After all, she <i>had</i> received a really hard hit this time, and her head <i>really</i> hurt like hell.<b><br/></b>Staggering upstairs and opening the door with the duck-shaped sign that said 'Kasumi', Ranma entered the room and promptly lay down on the immaculate bed without a glance at her surroundings. She closed her eyes. The only thing she wanted to do was rest for a few moments.</p><p><b></b>A minute later Kasumi entered the room with some wet washcloths. Applying one to Ranma's forehead she sat down at Ranma's side. The cursed martial artist sighed. She felt tired, <i>really </i>tired, more so than in a very long time. Even during this one time when her father had deprived her of sleep to enable her to fight even when fatigued she had not felt so exhausted.</p><p><b></b>This exhaustion ran deeper, for it was not a physical, but an emotional exhaustion. She had once read about it in one of the books Kasumi had given her and knew it was called 'Combat fatigue', a syndrome often displayed by soldiers in wars. And lately more than ever Ranma really felt that she was constantly under attack from all sides.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist sighed once more and opened her eyes. "Kasumi, <i>why</i> does Akane <i>hate</i> me so much?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi felt like crying again. The hurt and sadness in Ranma's voice were nearly too much for her. But for Ranma's sake she had to remain strong. "Ranma-kun, Akane does not hate you. She really does care deeply for you."</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed, this time even deeper. "She sure's hidin' it well, Kasumi. Very well. Regardless what I do, she <i>always</i> hits me 'n insults me. Even when I'm nice to her. Heck, 'specially when I'm nice to her. If I say something nice to her, she turns it into something sick 'n twisted. All the training you have given me, and what good did it do with Akane? Nuthin', Kasumi. Nuthin' at all."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi could empathise how Ranma was feeling. But she had to know if there was still hope for her sister. "Ranma, what about <i>your</i> feelings? Do you <i>love</i> Akane?" she asked bluntly.</p><p><b></b>Ranma locked her blue eyes on Kasumi's brown ones. That was no easy question. Not any more. "You know, Kasumi, at Jusendo, after I had killed Saffron, but seemingly too late to safe her, I held her in my arms and she closed her eyes and died. Then, at this moment, when I saw her lying in the peace and serenity of death, so relaxed and beautiful, I really <i>thought</i> that I loved her. Heck, I'm not even sure what love <i>is</i>! Baka oyaji sure never taught me. But at that one moment, you know, I felt such a bottomless pain when I felt I had lost Akane. I felt like the world had stopped. At that moment I <i>thought</i> I was in love with her, and I think I even said it. I yelled at the heavens for her to come back to me. Now I'm not so sure any more. Come on, I mean regardless how much I try to be nicer to her, she <i>always</i> suspects me to have some ul... ulte... what was that word again?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled. Ranma <i>had</i> improved tremendously in the past months. The others did not know or care, and only Akane and Mr. Saotome had objected to Ranma spending time with Kasumi for tutoring. Akane still did because she was obviously <i>very</i> jealous that Ranma spent so much time with her sister and thought he'd try to lead her on, and Mr. Saotome grumbled steadily how useless this tutoring was because he regarded everything besides the Art as useless. But Ranma's mother had put her foot down and had quietened those two. Although she had had to repeat it to drive the point home.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on his part had done everything he could to convince Akane that he was doing nothing 'perverted' with her older sister, but it was obvious to anyone that Akane did not trust him. At Jusendo, after he had killed Saffron for her he'd thought that she'd finally trust him. After all, he'd killed for her to save her. But what trust she may have had in him evaporated apparently in the weeks after the failed wedding, when Shampoo and Ukyo had once more tried to claim him. And that harder than ever.</p><p><b></b>And Akane, always quick to be jealous and angry had thought he'd lead them on, regardless how much he had said he didn't. Thus her behaviour had degraded to worse levels than ever before, and now she did not trust him at all. Because all was Ranma's fault due to the fact that he always led the others girls on and did nothing to solve this mess regarding the engagements. And Akane really hated how her rivals were hanging all over Ranma and how he was leading them on and doing perverted things with them, in her opinion.</p><p><b></b>But despite all that Ranma <i>had</i> improved his behaviour. The oldest Tendo sister had never told Ranma, but she believed that the martial artist was <i>very</i> intelligent. This thesis was supported by the fact that Ranma learned new martial arts techniques inhumanly fast. That he had been so bad in school had everything to do with lack of interest and probably lack of sleep and nothing with lack of intelligence, but in the last three months Kasumi had been able to cure him of that 'disease' mostly. The result had been raised hopes.</p><p><b></b>As for learning, the oldest Tendo daughter had simply used Ranma's inability to refuse a challenge he'd benefit from against him and had made him read as many dictionaries and even other, school related books as he could get hold of. He had grumbled in the beginning, but then his interest had been peaked. And she, having been the best of her class at all times even till graduation had really liked to tutor him. It had really made fun and still did.</p><p><b></b>And the success had soon shown itself, as Ranma, not to be bested in anything he regarded as a challenge had applied his Chestnut-fist speed and had created Chestnut-fist speed-reading. His vocabulary and overall performance had improved immensely. And it had also cured the infamous 'Saotome food-in-mouth-disease'. Sure, he still needed help from time to time, but he even knew how to use the 'big words' now and knew what they meant. He also did better in math and other school subjects he had not had much interest for before.</p><p><b></b>Aside from Kasumi and Nodoka nobody seemed to care or even acknowledge this, but Kasumi knew that the praise she gave Ranma meant a lot to the pigtailed martial artist. She could always see it in his eyes, how the gleam in them increased when she praised him for a job well done.</p><p><b></b>Though she knew that it would have meant very much to him had <i>Akane</i> given him a compliment for once. From her Ranma really only received insults and mistrust lately, and even Kasumi did not know why. She suspected it <i>could</i> have something to with the fact that Ranma was chased by Shampoo and Ukyo more than ever in addition to the fact that he spent so much time with her lately, but that was ridiculous. Kasumi was sure that she had hid her feelings perfectly.</p><p><b></b>And Akane had often, when she had hammered Ranma lately, accused him of trying to lead <i>her</i>, Kasumi, on too. Which was utterly ridiculous. Ranma had always been the perfect gentleman during the tutoring, even when he had been in female form. It was a fact that her little sisters' behaviour had gotten increasingly worse ever since after Jusendo and the failed wedding. But it was idiotic to be jealous because of the tutoring Ranma received. Her sister could not be <i>that </i>blinded by her jealousy and anger, could she? <b>'No,'</b> Kasumi mused to herself, <b>'that can't be it.'</b></p><p><b></b>These thoughts had run through her mind within seconds, and thus Kasumi was not delayed in her answer to Ranma's question. "What you mean is probably 'ulterior', Ranma." she answered.</p><p><b></b>Ranma-onna nodded from her position on the bed, taking a new washcloth from Kasumi. "Yeah, that. Ulterior. She always thinks I have an ulterior motive. That I'm doing something perverted. And she constantly clobbers me! In spite of the efforts I make to be nicer to her, to avoid insulting her, to make her compliments, she <i>still</i> seems to mallet me wherever I am and whatever I do. Heck, I have the feeling the better I treat her the worse she treats me! Even last week, when it was admittedly a bit better than usual, she still malleted me! She has even malleted me four times two weeks ago before I even <i>saw</i> her approaching me! What 'perverted deed' should I have done then? Breathed? And when I asked her why the heck she did it she malleted me some more! Apparently for good measure or sumthin'! Heck, I'll be getting bonus miles soon thanks to all the trips with Mallet Airs I 'undertook' lately. And it ain't freakin' funny!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi wiggled a finger. "Your language, Ranma-kun."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled sheepishly. "Sorry, Kasumi. But as said, she <i>always</i> accuses me of leading the other girls on, even though I gave Shampoo the cold shoulder ever since the wedding and treated Ukyo visibly only as a friend. Heck, I did not even talk to Shampoo once after the failed wedding, except in one-word-sentences. I never ate at the Nekohanten or Ucchans' and even <i>bought</i> my okonomiyakis from Ukyo, but what does Akane do? She accuses me that I'd do something perverted with them! And she's so damned jealous even though she ain't got no reason! It's not fair, it's just not fair, Kasumi! But to answer your question, I think I once loved her deeply. But whatever love I may have felt or still feel, it is dying. With each mallet-strike and insult it dies some more."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded solemnly. She had suspected something like that. And although her heart soared for a moment at the prospect that Ranma might decide to cancel the engagement to Akane, which might give <i>her</i> a chance, an equally big part of her felt sad for her sister. A sister who was apparently too stupid to see what a treasure Ranma really was.</p><p><b></b>But her sisterly duty demanded of her that she'd convince Ranma to give it one more chance. "Ranma, I <i>know</i> how hard it is for you, but please, for Akane's sake, give it one more try."</p><p><b></b>There, she had said it. Ever since she had discovered her own developing feelings for the pigtailed martial artist she had felt that she could be betraying her sister in some way. For <i>she</i> was Ranma's iinazuke. But with each passing month the resolve faltered when she had had to witness the constant abuse Ranma had to endure and still endured. By convincing Ranma to give Akane one last chance she felt that she had not betrayed her sister. She <i>had</i> done her sisterly duty. Now it was in the hands of the Kami. For her father and 'uncle' Saotome were surely no help, more the contrary.</p><p><b></b>And Kasumi did not understand <i>why</i> Ranma did not receive even an inkling of help from his father. It was blatantly obvious that Genma Saotome wanted to use his son to get his early retirement through the marriage of Akane and Ranma. For then both would inherit the Dojo and Genma would be able to manage the Dojo's finances, what with Ranma and Akane both being legal minors. Yes, that would probably be much to the fat pandas' liking.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi would never have said it out loud, but Genma Saotome was a lazy idiot. Just like regarding everything the fat man did, he did not invest energy to make it work. And by leaving all the work to Ranma, like he apparently always did, he literally put Ranma between a rock and a hard place. Like he had already so often in the past.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked at the eldest Tendo daughter with sad eyes once more. Fact that nearly caused Kasumi to act on the impulse to hug the cursed martial artist tightly. "You know, Kasumi, it is kinda ironic. I had a talk like that with Ryoga when we met, the talk I told ya of. With <i>Ryoga</i> of all people! And <i>he</i> understood me! You know what? I promised on my honour as a martial artist that I would give the whole thing one more month to work out. With Ryoga as my witness. That I didn't tell ya. Now all that is left is one more week. I have tried everything in my book to make this relationship work, but I'm tired of it, Kasumi, so tired. Ya know, sometimes I think Akane 'n me are like fire 'n oil, reason why it might never work out..." she mused, trailing off.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled softly and stroked Ranma's shoulder. At first, Ranma was surprised at the sudden touch and flinched back automatically, as if in fear of getting hit. Then she slowly relaxed and actually seemed to enjoy it. <b>'Oh my, Akane, what have you done? Ranma can't even endure a simple touch without flinching back. Is this engagement really worth <i>that</i>? Do we really have to sacrifice a young man's happiness to fulfil fathers' dream of the Joining of the schools?'</b> she asked herself. "Ranma-kun, could you answer me a question?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma slowly opened her eyes. "I'll try, Kasumi."</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo sister smiled. "That is all I ask. For there is one thing I'd like to know: why do you allow Akane to hit you? From what you told me of Jusendo you killed a god, Ranma. And I know just how good you are, I have seen it many times. So, why do you let Akane hit you all the time?"</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist thought a moment before answering. "You're right, Kasumi. I'm really, <i>really</i> good. Maybe on my way to become the strongest there is. But Akane's mallet is <i>more</i> than just that. It is no ordinary mallet, it is a ki-manifestation. As she needs only a tenth of a second to form the mallet and strike me, I do not have enough time to react. Well, not at all times. Sometimes she manages to surprise me and scores a good hit. As for why I <i>allow</i> her to let off her steam at me in the other cases, well, think about it. What if I countered her attacks at any given time, aside from those that happen too fast? What would happen then? She would get frustrated and might even hit Nabiki, my mom or even <i>you</i>, Kasumi. And that is a risk I can not take. I am the strongest around, thus I'm the 'buffer'. I don't even want to think what would happen if Akane hit <i>you</i>... or one of the others."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi's heart soared once more at the obvious care in his tone when Ranma had mentioned her. "I understand, Ranma-kun." was the only thing she managed to say.</p><p><b></b>Ranma managed a weak smile and sighed once more. "I am just <i>so</i> tired, Kasumi. Tired of the everlasting suspicion Akane puts me under, the constant malletings, the endless insults. And she <i>never ever</i> listens to my side of the story, and if she does, she only thinks I'm trying to excuse some perversity. And the <i>worst</i> of all, she never seems to trust me! And I killed a freakin' god for her, for Kami-samas sake! What do I hafta do ta gain her trust? Become a Kami? Sorry, no can do."</p><p><b></b>She sighed once more, really deeply. "You know, after Jusendo Ryoga and even Mousse, to a certain degree, have begun to treat me better. With Ryoga I'm even approaching something I'd call friendship once more. Akari is really good on him." she said smiling. But the smile faded soon. "The only one who remains unaffected despite all that has happened is Akane. Heck, she's not only unaffected by the whole change in dy... dyn... help me for a sec."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled. "What you mean is probably 'dynamics', Ranma."</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girl nodded. "Yeah, that. Akane, she remains fully unaffected by the change in dynamics. She still treats me worse than garbage, and that after I killed for her! Akane is so damned jealous and always seems to be angry at me lately, and I don't know why or what I can do against it! Regardless how cautious I am not to make her jealous, regardless how good I treat her, there always happens something that causes Akane to blow her top and mallet me. Even if it ain't my fault! And the old men with all their harpings and idiotic schemes sure don't help! I don't know how much longer I can go on, Kasumi. I give her one week, not more. One week for Akane and me to solve this mess..." she finished in a tired voice.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled at her, although the dead-line came as a surprise to her. It seemed as if Akane was on probation, and she did not even know it. And that was probably better so, else little sis would really blow her top, as would her father and 'uncle'. But to be honest, Kasumi could not take Ranma's decision amiss. Not after how they had treated him here.</p><p><b></b>But like always, she had to pretend and smile for the sake of the family. Although the smile had become an increasingly tired one. Inwardly Kasumi asked herself when it would fall off her face. "I am sure everything will work out, Ranma. Have faith." she said. Inwardly her mental gears were grinding. Those news were really interesting. So her sister had only one more week to make it work. Her resolve grew. In this one week she would do everything in her might to help Ranma and Akane.</p><p><b></b>Then, when she had really done everything she could put her conscience to rest. Should it not work out between Akane and Ranma despite her efforts, she would take a chance and show him her feelings. Hopefully Ranma would respond. "I am sure Akane will soon come to see what a fine catch you are, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>Ranma only snorted. Sure, and cows would learn how to fly under their own power. No, she doubted that Akane would leave one good hair on her, but she would, as she had promised, give it her all. After all, her word was the only thing that held meaning beside the Art and her love for her mother. Formerly her love to Akane had also belonged into this category...</p><p><b></b>Speaking of the devil, Akane had just finished her training in the dojo when she noticed that the first floor was empty. Not that she was interested in what the pervert was doing, far from it, but she had to ensure that he did not molest her sister. It had been proven time and time again after the failed wedding that he could not be trusted. She might love him, but he made her so angry and so jealous! And he was a pervert.</p><p><b></b>And he might protest as much as he wanted, but there existed enough proof that he <i>was</i> leading Ukyo and Shampoo on. Else he would have resolved the engagement mess a long time ago. No, he probably enjoyed it how the girls were hanging all over him, and especially Shampoo with her ample assets. The pervert probably loved it how she pressed her bust-line against his body. It made her so angry! And, she had to admit to herself, jealous too.</p><p><b></b>The thought alone how Shampoo pressed herself against Ranma and how he squirmed in her hugs and rubbed against her body caused Akanes blood to  to it that Ranma had claimed he had avoided those two like the plague. How come that Shampoo had always told her a different story? Each time she had met the Amazon as of late she had said that her Airen had just left. Which had made her somewhat suspicious, as <i>Shampoo</i> had been the one who had claimed this. But lately she had seen so many examples of Ranma's unfaithfulness with the other girls, which made it credible again. No, he was not to be believed.</p><p><b></b>Thus she went upstairs to check if someone was there and began checking the rooms. Untold what the pervert could do when he was alone in the house with her sister. What with his talent at entrancing women she had to protect her sweet and innocent sister. <b>'Hmm, his own room is empty, as is Nabiki's. Hmm, maybe he is in Kasumi's... nah.'</b></p><p><b></b>In spite of her thoughts she opened the door to the room of her oldest sister, and what she saw incensed her instantly. There was the pervert, lying on her sisters' bed of all people! Probably doing something <i>really</i> perverted!<b><br/></b>She did not notice that Kasumi was sitting beside Ranma with a washcloth nor did she notice that Ranma was in female form. All that counted to the Akane-logic-system was: Ranma plus in Kasumi's room equals HENTAI. Nobody entered the room of her sweet and innocent sister without paying the price!</p><p><b></b>Akane did also not notice that Kasumi had jumped up and yelled for her to stop, all that she noticed was the red haze before her eyes and the weight of the mallet in her right hand. And her target. The Akane-targeting-system locked unerringly on Ranma, and everything else was blinded out.</p><p><b></b>The scream "RANMA NO HENTAI!" followed, and said mallet was brought down on Ranma's frame seconds later with full force, driving her through the bed and destroying said bed and a good portion of the flooring in the process. Ranma had had no chance to react at all, she been <i>much</i> too surprised. And Kasumi had had no other chance but to jump out of the way or risk getting clobbered too.</p><p><b></b>Slowly the haze in front of Akane's eyes retreated, and she noticed her sister for the first time. Hah! She <i>had</i> been right! Ranma <i>had</i> wanted to molest her sister! Her sister would be glad that she had saved her. Her sister would... but one moment... why did Kasumi look <i>anything</i> but happy?</p><p><b></b>Kasumi was<i> indeed</i> anything but happy. The otherwise so serene woman was quite furious with her little sister. But before Kasumi could give her sister a piece of her mind a weak moan came from the destroyed bed. "Ooohh... what did ya do that for, ya stupid uncute tomboy?" Ranma-onna complained, holding her hurting head..</p><p><b></b>Akane glowed red with rage once more and was about to give Ranma another malleting when Kasumi stopped her. "That will be enough, young lady. Are you completely out of your mind?"</p><p><b></b>The force of Kasumi's otherwise so caring and serene voice was enough to stop Akane dead in her tracks, and she just stared at her sister uncomprehending. The pervert had entered her sisters' room; he had to be punished for this iniquity! "B... but he..." was all Akane could sputter before she was stopped by a stern glance from Kasumi. And a stern glance from a woman who had never shown anger before had so much more effect and stopped the youngest Tendo daughter once more in her tracks.</p><p><b></b>The whole action had caused quite a racket, and Nodoka, who had been on her way back from grocery shopping (she had had to buy them herself after Akane had bought the wrong ingredients and spices yesterday), came in running. She barely had the time to put down her shopping when she heard the yelling. <b>'Kami-sama, what has happened now?'</b> was the thought that ran through Nodoka Saotomes' mind when she ran upstairs.</p><p><b></b>She nearly stopped cold when she heard Kasumi, Kasumi of all people raise her voice. What could have happened to make this paragon of a traditional Japanese woman and the decal of peace and quiet angry?</p><p><b></b>Gathering her bearings Nodoka hastily entered what obviously was Kasumi's room. What greeted her was the sight of her son-turned-daughter lying in a heap amongst a destroyed bed. "What has happened here?" Nodoka asked.</p><p><b></b>Akane glowered again. She felt that she had done nothing wrong. "Ask the pervert! He was molesting my sister!" she yelled in what she felt was righteous outrage.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka however decided to get an idea of the situation herself. By asking her son-turned-daughter, and not the obviously enraged Akane. Enraged persons were, after all, not known for their objectivity. "Ranma, what has happened here?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Said martial artist staggered unsteadily to her feet, and Kasumi was at her side in a flash. Fact that did not go unnoticed by Nodoka. Her eye-brow made a perfect Spock-manoeuvre, but otherwise she refrained from comment. Who knew, maybe Kasumi could become Ranma's mistress, and then...</p><p><b></b>The thought of all the grandchildren she would receive let her eyes glaze over for a second, and she returned to reality just in time to hear her son-turned-daughter's answer. "It all began when I tasted the food Akane had prepared. I had a... bad reaction to it, and Akane malleted me because of it."</p><p><b></b>At this, Nodoka sighed and Akane glowered even more. The Saotome matriarch shook her head. It had gone good for so long. "Go on, my child."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded, still holding her head. "One landing in the Koi-pond and a real nasty headache later I staggered into the house. Kasumi had the first aid kit ready, but then she said I did not look too good and she send me upstairs to lie down on her bed instead of my futon. She said it was more comfy than the futon, and she was right." Ranma said, and looked up at Kasumi, who was still keeping her steady. "Then she came with some cold washcloths to help my headache. Thanks for that, Kasumi. That was really nice." Ranma-onna said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Akane glowered once more. "Stop flirting with my sister, you pervert! Isn't it enough that you're leading Ukyo and Shampoo on? And you're female to boot! Does your perversity know no bounds?" she accused.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed. Why was she so jealous and angry when she had no reason at all? Didn't she know how much she'd loved her, and maybe still did? Didn't she see that she was killing this love with her jealousy, anger and mistrust? And that although she had no reason at all? How often had she said that she had no interest in Ukyo or Shampoo? A zillion times, but apparently it was not enough.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Nodoka's eye-brow repeated the Spock-manoeuvre, but this time for different reasons. Had Akane listened to herself lately? Nodoka really wondered if the youngest Tendo daughter had taken her prescribed medication. And what was it with her fixation on perversity? Odd. "Akane, I do see nothing perverted in thanking someone. Do <i>you</i>?"</p><p><b></b>The youngest Tendo child sputtered, but no answer came forth. It was as Nodoka had thought, and slowly the Saotome matriarch wondered if Akane really was a suitable wife for her only son. She now had had many occasions to observe Akane, and ever since Ranma's other suitors had begun to show their interest in him again the youngest Tendo child had become progressively more angry and jealous. But instead of playing it cool and showing Ranma that she loved him and that she was the one for him she drove him away with her downright irrational behaviour.</p><p><b></b>No, the behaviour Akane had displayed in the last few months was not that of a mature woman, rather that of a very immature child that was used to having her way. Maybe that was why she could not deal with the concurrence Ukyo and this Shampoo girl presented. This bared watching. "Please proceed to tell, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Of course, mother." she said, and Nodoka beamed at her child's improved manners. "As said, I was recovering from the mother of all headaches because of repeated blows to said head with the help of cold washcloths, and me and Kasumi talked. Then, out of nowhere, Akane came barging into the room and screamed "RANMA NO HENTAI!" and drove me through the bed with her mallet. Kasumi yelled for her to stop before she hit me, but she did not listen. And I was so surprised that I couldn't do anything. That's what happened."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded, and moments later she fixed Akane with a steel glance. "Do you have an explanation for your behaviour, young lady? And it better be a good one!"</p><p><b></b>Akane turned red and sputtered. Then her shame turned into anger once more. After all, it was not her fault! "Why should <i>I</i> explain myself? It's all the <i>perverts</i> fault!" she yelled and stormed out of the room.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi bowed her head in shame of her younger sister's words and deeds, but tried to explain her behaviour nonetheless. "Akane is a really sweet girl, she only has a problem with her temper, Auntie." <b>'And her jealousy.'</b> she mentally added.<b> 'I'll have to check my books to find even stronger herbs for Akane. I promised myself to help Ranma and little sis, and I will give my all.' </b></p><p><b></b>Nodoka looked at Kasumi with a steel glance, which faltered soon. After all, it was not Kasumis' fault. "That may be, but I'm beginning to doubt that Akane is the right choice as a wife for my child. As it is, after seeing her behaviour I'm really tempted to dissolve the engagement between Ranma and Akane on the spot." she said with a sigh and looked at her child, who was looking back with a sad expression.</p><p><b></b>Noticing that this was developing into a mother-child-talk Kasumi quietly and politely left the room. Ranma gave her a brief smile when she passed, and once again, Nodoka noticed. "But what of <i>your</i> feelings, my child?" she then asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked stunned for a moment. After all this time, finally someone was considering her feelings? "Okay, who are you and what have you done with my mother?" the cursed martial artist asked, keeping her voice straight.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka was flabbergasted. "Run that by me again, dear?"</p><p><b></b>Her son-turned-daughter smirked. "What I wanted to express with that is, that no one ever took the time to ask <i>me</i> how I felt about the whole thing. Oyaji and Mr. Tendo would always try to pressure me 'n Akane into marrying, regardless how we felt, and even you supported the wedding-idea after Jusendo. That's why I'm surprised, mom. No one, not even <i>you</i>, considered <i>my</i> feelings in the matter. Or Akanes'." she added as an afterthought.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka sighed. She gathered her inner strength for a moment and looked then directly into her son-turned-daughters´ eyes. To admit ones faults was not easy, but the ones strong of character did it when they knew that they were wrong. And she <i>had</i> been wrong. "I know, child, and I'm extremely ashamed of that." she replied, bowing her head. Then she looked up again. "I was so fixated on the wedding," <b>'and on grandchildren'</b> she mentally added, "and I was so sure that you loved Akane that I never actually asked you what <i>you</i> felt. Nor did I bother to ask Akane. But that little display Akane has given and her behaviour I have witnessed in the past months has caused me to doubt the wisdom of my actions. And the wisdom of your engagement to her as a whole if the outcome will be this." she said and pointed at the destroyed bed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed and nodded. "I know, mom. It is hard for me to bear her anger and jealousy, and that although I ain't given her no reason to be angry 'n jealous at all. She sees how Shampoo glomps me 'n apparently things I enjoy it. But I <i>never</i> do! You have no idea how often I've said her that I hate it! You know what she usually answers?" Her mother shook her head, and Ranma continued. "She says <i>'Then why didn't you solve this damned engagement mess you created?'</i>. Doesn't she understand that I don't want to hurt Ukyo and not even Shampoo? But when I said her that she answered <i>'Okay, if their feelings are more important than mine, fine!'</i> and malleted me. Ever since then she does not even listen to me. But please, mom, give me this one week to try it one more time. I still have feelings for her."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka paused for a moment to think before answering. "I understand, my child. And the wedding and all what has happened after it up till now has shown me a lot of things that I hadn't bothered to think all the way through. The foremost and most essential is that <i>you</i> should be the one to decide who you spend the rest of your life with and when you marry. It is <i>your</i> life, Ranma, and you only have this one. And what <i>I</i> think doesn't matter, and especially what Genma thinks or says is surely not important any more. Not after what he did. If you want one more chance with Akane, so be it. Know that I'll support you whatever you should decide. But don't you want to tell Akane that she is on probation?"</p><p><b></b>Her son-turned-daughter made a thoughtful face at hearing this. "Truth be told, mom, I stopped listening to anything the Panda had to say beside Martial Arts after Jusenkyo. Sometimes I think I should have stopped listening  for telling Akane, I don't think that would be good. She would feel pressured and might <i>act</i> good, but not on her own accord. And she has to treat me good or even 'normal' on her own, or we'll never have a healthy, normal relationship. So please don't tell her either. If she can't..." Ranma-onna trailed off, looking sad.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded, in spite of the jab against her husband she could not deny the truth behind her son-turned-daughters' statement. As well regarding her husband as Akane. "He surely has created a mess, hasn't he? But what about Akane? As for not telling her, I understand and support you. But do you love her?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma hesitated for a moment. "You know, mom, Kasumi asked me the same question." Spock-manoeuvre again. "I think I loved her once, but what with the constant malleting, her everlasting mistrust and her constant insults I must say that I don't know any more. I still have feelings for her, but all I know is that these feelings for Akane are slowly dying, bit by bit. And she does not seem to care, she even often told me that she hates me to my face. Add to it that I overheard her saying so on several occasions. Is that they way how someone acts who is supposedly in love with me? But I gave my word as a martial artist that I would give her this one month and this one more chance. Now all that is left is one week, and however it will turn out, I'll keep my word. She'll get this one week. But that Ryoga understood me…"</p><p><b></b>And thus Ranma began to tell her mother about her talks with Ryoga and Kasumi and about her feelings. She left nothing out, and when Ranma had ended Nodoka Saotome was really proud of her child. Ever since she had learned of the curse of her child, Nodoka had come to reconsider her view of manliness. A few talks with Kasumi, another traditional Japanese woman had brought the point home that her version of manliness was gravely outdated. Had she not already deemed the contract fulfilled, she would have torn it to pieces.</p><p><b></b>Besides, she had never actually wanted to hold Ranma to this promise. When her son had 'signed' the contract, he had been far too young to understand what it meant, and therefore she had never planned to hold her child to it. No, the contract had been made to keep Genma in line. Sadly, that had failed royally.</p><p><b></b>Ever since the talks with Kasumi she had refrained from harping constantly about Ranma being manly, and slowly but steadily the relationship between mother and child had improved. Now she really did not care any more if her child was manly, as long as she would get lots and lots of grandchildren. And if Akane should really prove to be unsuitable as a wife, who knew, maybe Kasumi would prove to be the one. It also seemed that Kasumi did not have any problems with her childs' curse. The same thing could obviously not be said about Akane...</p><p><b></b>Nodoka sighed. "I know it is hard, my child, but I fear that you must do what giri demands, Ranma. If things won't work out with Akane we will find another way. Together."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. It all came back to giri, and she accepted this. They had to save what was left of the family honour. But she had a request to make of her mother. "Mom, could you do me a favour?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka looked at her child with a smile. "Of course, dear."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth smiled back. "Mom, could you make sure that oyaji won't be able to interfere in the last week of the time limit I have set for Akane and me? If he and Mr. Tendo keep pestering me and Akane constantly it will <i>never</i> work out. And despite all that has happened I <i>want</i> it to work out. I have still feelings for Akane. Do you have an idea?"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka did not hesitate to answer. "Sure. Our house has been finished last week, and needs to be equipped. What do you say if I take Mr. Panda by the ear and set him on the task?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked evilly. "That would be perfect! It would annoy him to no end and at the same time it would keep him out of our hair. Thanks, mom, you're the best!" she exclaimed and embraced her mother in a hug, which was returned with equal force.</p><p><b></b>It all would be decided within a week...</p><p><b></b>Later that evening Nabiki had tried to charge Ranma for the destroyed bed. She had seen the destruction and had wrongly guessed it to be Ranma's fault.</p><p><b></b>Boy had she been wrong. And surprised to boot, when her older sister had related the story of how Akane had behaved. She had been nearly astonished when Kasumi had said that it all had been Akanes' fault. And that with force and in a tone that bordered on anger. Which had been very surprising to Nabiki, because she had <i>never</i> seen Kasumi angry.</p><p><b></b>This time Nabiki had gleefully charged her own little sister for a destroyed item, even if it would cost Akane the savings of a few months. It had been the first time ever that someone else beside Ranma had been charged since the Saotome youth had arrived, and it made the youngest Tendo angry once more.</p><p><b></b>In her book, <i>everything</i> was Ranma's fault. Had he not been such a pervert and made her so angry and jealous nothing would have happened. Why did he have to lead her own sister on? Were Ukyo, Shampoo and Kodachi not enough? Anyway, the youngest Tendo continued smouldering.</p><p><b></b>Soun and Genma had returned a while later, drunken as lords. Upon seeing his 'baby girl' all upset Soun had sobered enough to employ his demon-head technique to make her 'ungrateful fiancé', who had returned to male form, apologise.</p><p><b></b>His demon-head had however disappeared like a snowball in hell when he had heard a specific sound. A sound that usually drove his friend Genma up the wall.</p><p><b></b>SHING. That, incidentally is the sound of a katana being drawn by the resident katana-lady. And Nodoka had steel in her hands as well as in her eyes. For her patience with the old men was running thin <i>very</i> rapidly. In her book it was high time that Akane was held on to being nicer to her son more forcefully. And it was Soun's job to do so.</p><p><b></b>Thus a verbal tongue-lashing from Nodoka for Soun Tendo for neglecting his duties as a father had followed, and afterwards said Soun Tendo had been reduced to the physical size of a mouse, metaphorically speaking.</p><p><b></b>And when Genma had tried to help his friend Nodoka had gleefully given <i>him</i> a tongue-lashing too, even if out of general principles. What with Genma and his idiocy, some reason or the other could always be found with utmost ease. And Nodoka <i>still </i>did not know about the Neko-ken...</p><p><b></b>To get the Panda out of the house after that had been easy. All it had taken was a show of naked steel, and Genma had been quick to obey. After Soun Tendo had lost his co-conspirator he had also lost a lead he could follow and a good portion of his backbone. Which made him essentially harmless. Fountain-sama had then erupted into a torrent of tears and had lamented that the schools would now never be joined.</p><p><b></b>Finally they called it a night, and Ranma had, for the first time since long the guest room to himself. Sleep did however not come easily to him this night. Not that he missed the baka panda, far from it, but he kept on asking himself if what he still felt for Akane was enough.</p><p><b></b>His thoughts started to spin around, and slowly sleep claimed the pigtailed martial artist.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
