No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 2: A long day </b></p><p><b></b>When Ranma was on his way back to the Tendo Dojo after the talk with Ryoga evening was already approaching. The cursed martial artist had decided to use the direct route and had taken to the rooftops to avoid getting splashed again, but he was sure everyone would be on his case once he got back. Like always.</p><p><b></b>While jumping over the rooftops, he had to think about his mother. At first, after she had found out about the curse, Nodoka Saotome had not believed Ranma when he had told her that he got splashed more times than he could count a day, but after a shopping trip together she <i>had</i> been convinced. In the beginning she had demanded that he change back immediately, but after the tenth time she had given up and shaken her head in defeat.</p><p><b></b>Ranma shook his head and smiled in remembrance. It sure had been funny how his mother had grown progressively more irritated with each change, until she had finally relented. Ranma hadn't been able to deny himself to say "Now you see with what I have to put up."</p><p><b></b>That had been a few months ago, and ever since after the failed wedding his mothers´ behaviour towards him had improved. So she had stopped her constant harpings about manliness, which was a good thing in his book. Slightly smiling to himself Ranma landed soundlessly on the roof of the Tendo Dojo. His arrival had however not gone unnoticed, for seconds later his 'loving' iinazuke came storming in his direction. Obviously she had couchedin the area to catch him once he returned.</p><p><b></b>Red faced she looked up at the roof, from which Ranma was just getting down in one swift jump. "RANMA NO BAKA! Where have you been? Smooching and kissing with Ukyo? Or was it Shampoo? Or perhaps both? You pervert! Answer me!" she yelled in obvious anger and hefted her mallet in one hand.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed to himself. <b>'Yes, Akane, and I led on the whole cheerleading team. And Kodachi, Ukyo and Shampoo too, while I was at it.'</b> he thought ironically. <b>'If she would kill me if I voiced that out loud? Yup. For sure. Well, here goes nothing...'</b> he thought and sighed internally before answering. He had sworn to himself, on his honour as a martial artist to boot and with Ryoga as witness, that he would give his all to make it work out. And Ranma Saotome kept his promises, came there hell or high water.</p><p><b></b>Instead of insulting her on the spot like he would have done in former times in face of her jealous, irrational and totally unjustified behaviour he drew in a deep breath and looked Akane directly into her beautiful brown eyes. Eyes that were presently clouded with anger and jealousy. "I didn't do nothin', Akane. I went for a walk in the park after you send me there and then I met Ryoga. Then we..."</p><p><b></b>He did not manage to finish the sentence. "Aha!" Akane cried. "You picked on poor Ryoga once more! RANMA NO BAKA!" she yelled and swung the mallet at him. Once more Akane presented her remarkable talent to jump with little to no data to the totally wrong conclusions. If those could be called conclusions at all.</p><p><b></b>Lately Ranma really wondered <i>why</i> Akane was so angry at him. He had really improved his behaviour, had avoided Shampoo where he could, had treated Ukyo as a friend and had even made her, Akane, compliments. But how did she thank him? Right, with a mallet to the head. Like presently.</p><p><b></b>Dodging or stopping said mallet would have usually been childs' play to him, but he had sworn that he would make it work. If Akane would lose her anger through hitting him, so be it. Thus the mallet connected with force against his cranium and send him into the ground. But instead of inducing unconsciousness like in former times the strike only made him dizzy.</p><p><b></b>Ranma wondered why that was so, not that he didn't take it in stride. He had noticed that he had become much stronger and tougher ever since Jusendo, and his ki-reserves had deepened considerably and were apparently still doing so.</p><p><b></b>It had made things a lot easier in his fights against Mousse, for the blind duck-boy did still go all out against him in his quest to win Shampoo's affections by removing the obstacle, namely him. At first Ranma had thought that Mousse had overcome his obsession with Shampoo after Jusendo, but obviously he had been wrong.</p><p><b></b>The male Chinese Amazon was still chasing Shampoo like a mot the light, and he still saw Ranma as a hindrance that had to be removed. Not that Ranma had done anything regarding Shampoo. Heck, he had not even talked to her at all after the failed wedding except maybe in syllables.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed internally. When would all those obsessed idiots like Mousse and Kuno get a clue? Anyway, his ole man had also noticed that Ranma was now way out of his league, and the cursed martial artist mused that his Pop would not even be able to beat him using his so called Saotome Sealed techniques.</p><p><b></b>Although the morning spars with his father had mostly lost its appeal to Ranma, he still partook in them, making them a challenge by limiting himself to his father's level. But inwardly he wished that he would meet someone on an equivalent level.</p><p><b></b>Sure, Ryoga could nearly keep up with him due to his Bakusai Tenketsu training, but even though it had become progressively easier for him to beat the Lost Boy. Only good that Ryoga did not succumb to fits of uncontrolled rage any more when he lost to Ranma nowadays. It was much better for the surroundings...</p><p><b></b>Shaking himself out of his musings and shaking the dizziness out of his head at the same time Ranma got up, dusting his clothes of. "No, Akane, I did <i>not</i> pick on him." he told the retreating back of his iinazuke. Said iinazuke whirled around, anger once more aflame. She <i>always</i> seemed to be angry and jealous lately, around him anyway, and Ranma had yet to find out the reason why without getting killed in the process.</p><p><b></b>In a calm and controlled voice Ranma continued, well aware of the danger. "We just talked. He told me what he had done in the last two months, among things." he said, and Akane slowly deflated. Good, the pervert seemed for once not have picked on poor Ryoga. If he could be believed, that is...</p><p><b>'Pheew, the immediate danger seems to have passed. Mount Akane ain't erupting again for now.'</b> Ranma thought. "Do you mind if we go indoors? I figure the neighbours have heard enough for today." he suggested.</p><p><b></b>Before Akane could get out an angry reply a voice from the door interrupted. "They don't give a damn any more, Ranma." Nabiki said. "Not since they've made their houses soundproof."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked. "And I bet you conducted the deals, huh, Nabiki?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki grinned sharklike. "Naturally, Saotome."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded to himself. He had expected no less of Nabiki. If there was an opportunity to make a profit, Nabiki was there."Thought so, Nabiki. Do you know when lunch will be ready? And maybe what the old men are up to?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki held her hand out. "2000 yen and I'll tell you."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist snorted. He couldn't be sure that she was joking and didn't want to take a chance. For Nabiki seldom joked where money was concerned. To be true, she never joked where money was concerned. "Thanks, but no thanks. I'll find out myself." Ranma said and entered the house.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was greeted by the usual sight. His father and Mr. Tendo were sitting at the Shogi board, and both fathers were cheating with abandon. As always. Upon his arrival, both looked up. "Where have you been, foolish and worthless boy? Your iinazuke cried bitter tears because you slighted her so, and you ran away like a coward! Oh, what a dishonour my own son is to me!" his father cried.</p><p><b></b>Ranma regretted his promise to play nice for the first time now. <i>He</i>, a dishonour? Who had been the idiot who had shot their family honour so often he had lost count? What right did the baka panda have to talk about honour? Heck, he wouldn't recognise honour even when it bit him in his furry butt! Phew!</p><p><b></b>And <i>he</i> had run away? If his memory served him right it had been <i>Akane</i> who had malleted him out of the compound and into LEO. But did the idiots tell <i>her</i> to apologise to him? Or even to be nicer <i>to him</i>, for a change?  why should they? Akane apparently never did anything wrong. Hypocrites.</p><p><b></b>Oh, how he longed to give his father a good tongue lashing, but in order to give the relationship with Akane a chance to work out he had to refrain from doing so. Because the old farts would say that Akane had done nothing wrong, Akane would see herself confirmed in her actions and he would get into a crosstalk which would likely end in a  he really didn't need another one. Two per day were more than enough in his book.</p><p><b></b>Thus he had to control himself for now. Payback would come tomorrow at the latest. Sparring time or how to make the Panda hit the pond until he saw , no holding back tomorrow. Well, not much.</p><p><b></b>Naturally Soun Tendo threw his two cents into the mix. "HOW COULD YOU MAKE MY LITTLE GIRL CRY! NOW THE SCHOOLS WILL NEVER BE JOINED!" Soun bellowed, applying his dreaded Demon-Head technique.</p><p><b></b>But instead of being scared and scampering away from the apparition like in former times Ranma only looked bored and completely unamused. He had fought and killed a god. Did the old man actually believe he would be scared by a chi-manifestation any more? <b>'Phew, if the old idiots really want to join the schools so badly they should tell Akane to stop treating me like she does. If I only <i>breathe</i> wrong I get malleted these days. But do they tell her to treat me as nice as I treat her? Nooo. So spare me your ramblings, old farts!'</b> he thought, blasting them through the wall in his imagination.</p><p><b></b>But instead of reacting or insulting the two old farts Ranma completely ignored them to their complete astonishment and entered the kitchen, where Kasumi was working as usual. "Hello Kasumi." he said and smiled. "Do you need a helping hand?"</p><p><b></b>The eldest Tendo daughter looked up from the stove and smiled back. "It would be nice if you could help me to serve the meal, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Sure thing, Kasumi." the cursed martial artist answered and did just that.</p><p><b></b>Five minutes later everyone was seated, and between bites Ranma related what Ryoga had told him. No one beside Kasumi, Nodoka and Nabiki noticed Ranma's altered attitude towards the lost boy, and Akane often cried how he should stop picking on poor Ryoga, although it was blatantly obvious that Ranma had not done so in the slightest and still did not do so.</p><p><b></b>Even Nodoka, who had returned from running some errands and who was now sitting beside her husband was beginning to worry about Akane. The girl seemed unnaturally angry lately.</p><p><b></b>From then on, after Ranma had finished telling them about his meeting with Ryoga (of which he had given them an abridged version), the meal progressed normally, without any incidents. At the end of the meal, however, Akane had one of her 'best' moments. Ranma had helped Kasumi to clear the table under the protests of his father, who had said it was a housewife´s job, and after this had been done, Ranma bowed to Kasumi. "Kasumi, the meal was delicious as always. Thanks."</p><p><b></b>The cry "RANMA NO BAKA!" came out of nowhere, and suddenly Ranma felt himself being launched towards the koi-pond. The hit in and on itself did not hurt much, but the unprovokedness of the attack did so much more. Ranma shook her head sadly and exited the Koi-pond, dripping wet. <b>'Why me?'</b> was all Ranma could think at the moment.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka turned towards Akane with a stern face. "<i>Why</i> did you hit my son, Akane?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki was asking herself the same question. She praised herself to be a good observer, and lately she had noticed that her little sis was getting more and more jealous and angry. Her temper had turned worse than ever, which might have to do with the fact that Ukyo and Shampoo were pulling out all the stops to win Ranma. But the Saotome youth had steadily refused their advances and still did his best to stay clear of them. And Nabiki had a lot of proof for that. No, Ranma was not unfaithful, rather the opposite.</p><p><b></b>And she had tried to drive that point home towards her sister, but Akane had not listened. She never did lately, and it seemed as if it had gotten even worse ever since Kasumi had begun to tutor Ranma. And that although her sister had made phenomenal progress with Ranma. It had been a month since he had last exhibited his well known 'Saotome-foot-in-the-mouth-technique'. And still Akane reacted with anger and jealousy. But why? Akane could not be jealous that Ranma spent time with Kasumi, could she? There simply was no reason for that. Ranma would never lead her sister on, and it was very unlikely that Kasumi would fall for the Saotome youth.</p><p><b></b>Could it be that the constant pressure of her father and 'uncle' Saotome, in addition to Akane's jealousy and anger because of Shampoo and Ukyo and the fact, that Ranma seemingly did nothing to resolve the engagement mess were slowly killing or had already killed the love Akane felt for Ranma? And Nabiki knew that Akane loved Ranma or had at least loved him, even if she had never acted on it or shown it too him. Little sis had always been way too stubborn to admit her feelings (outside from anger) to anyone.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter did not think that Akane <i>had</i> stopped loving Ranma, but the fact remained that Akane treated Ranma worse than ever. And Nabiki did not know how long the Saotome youth would put up with this. After all, Akane's behaviour towards Ranma bordered on gross mistreatment. From all the evidence she had seen Nabiki slowly came to the conviction that her little sister and Ranma could never have a healthy, lasting relationship. Not the way Akane behaved at the moment.</p><p><b></b>And at the moment it was Ranma alone who put any effort into making a relationship with her little sister possible, and he was, even in her opinion, making a supreme effort. The fathers with her mindless and outright idiotic schemes and their constant pressure on the two were sure no help. Maybe she, Nabiki, had done the right thing for he wrong reasons at the wedding. Hmm, this had to be watched.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile her little sister had faltered somewhat under the stern glare of the Saotome matriarch. "He... he was being a pervert with Kasumi!" she declared.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka was at a loss for words in face of that answer, and Nabiki shook her head. She had to voice it. "Sis, he only <i>thanked </i>Kasumi for a good meal. That's called <i>politeness</i>."</p><p><b></b>Akane however did not budge. "That does not change that he was and is a pervert!" she declared angrily and stormed off towards the dojo.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma had staggered back into the house, and Kasumi had a kettle of hot water at the ready. Ranma however politely declined. "No thanks, Kasumi." she said, but before she could continue to say anything she was once more interrupted, as so often.</p><p><b></b>"What! You wanna stay a weak girl? Oh the dishonour! My son is a worthless and weak little girl!" Genma exclaimed, crying crocodile tears.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had tried to tame her temper for quite some time now, but that was the straw that broke the proverbial camels back. "Oyaji no baka!" she exclaimed and launched her father into the Koi-pond. "<i>Who</i> is weak now, stupid Panda?" she sneered at the Panda.</p><p><b></b>"Growf growfl growl!" was Panda-mans response from the Koi-pond, which meant so much as <b>'Oh my head!'</b>. Why was he seeing so many Pandas dancing around his head? Uhh, Ranma did pack quite a wallop...</p><p><b></b>Nodoka, who was torn between chiding her son-turned-daughter for improper behaviour or praising her for correcting her fathers' utterly stupid and misogynistic behaviour, decided to do the latter. "THAT he had coming. But why <i>do</i> you want to stay a girl, dear?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma resigned from rolling her eyes. Why did she <i>always</i> have to explain and justify herself? "It's quite simple, mom. I want a good soak in the furo, and it would make little sense to change back now when I change back in a minute or so anyhow. Rather use the water on the stupid Panda. Or on second though, <i>don't</i>. All he's doing is talkin' rubbish. I'm now off into the furo, and I don't wanna be disturbed! By <i>nobody</i>!"</p><p><b></b>Sensing her mood, everyone refrained from saying anything and Ranma was able to reach the furo unoffended. She made sure to put out the sign that said that the furo was occupied. No, there was no need to have <i>another</i> Akane incident. Two clobberings per day were <i>more </i>than enough for her taste.</p><p><b></b>A minute or so later Ranma, now returned to male form was soaking in the hot bath. Slowly the stress was leaving his muscles, and he began to feel relaxed for the first time this day. He did not know how long he lay there, simply relaxing.</p><p><b></b>In this state of near meditation he was always able to think most clearly. His thoughts kept returning to how he could solve the whole mess his father's actions had entangled him in. But no solution came to mind. As the water became steadily colder, Ranma exited the tub and just wanted to reach for a towel, when...</p><p><b></b>"RANMA NO HENTAI!"</p><p><b></b>Perfect. Just his luck. He <i>had</i> put the sign out, and <i>Akane</i> would walk in on <i>him</i>. Talk about repeating patterns. And naturally, <i>everything</i> was <i>his</i> fault. Although she, unlike him, was still wearing a bathrobe, which protected her modesty from his perverted´ eyes. He sighed and prepared for the inevitable. He grabbed a large towel and adjusted it to make sure that it would not come off through the force of the blow that was to come.</p><p><b></b>And seconds later the mallet connected with his head again (an overhead swing this time), for the third time this day. The tiles cracked under the pressure, and the blow was nearly hard enough to embed him into the floor.</p><p><b></b>Shaking his head once more to clear it Ranma got up and adjusted the towel once more to cover himself better, for he could already hear footsteps in the distance.</p><p><b></b>Akane's yell had obviously caught the attention of the others, and a minute later Nodoka, Kasumi and Nabiki barged into the furo. The absence of the old farts, however, was suspicious.</p><p><b></b>Seeing the cracked tiles Nabiki was the first to reach the right conclusion. "What did he do <i>now</i>, Akane?"she asked, while mentally calculating the costs replacing the damaged tiles would cause.</p><p><b></b>Akane still glowered with anger. "He was being a PERVERT, that's what! I wanted to use the furo, and he <i>flashed</i> me! YOU HENTAI!" she screamed at Ranma, who refrained from comment a he was still nursing the newest addition to his lumps.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki turned to her sister. What with her history concerning boys she could understand Akane's reaction. But one question remained. "And why did <i>you</i> walk in on <i>him</i> although the sign was out?"</p><p><b></b>Akane looked stunned for a moment, then glowered again. "And how would <i>you</i> know, sis?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smirked, although the smirk was an entirely unpleasant one. "Be careful with your accusations, little sis. As a matter of fact, I passed the furo by and saw that it was still occupied. I wanted to take a soak myself, but the sign was out."</p><p><b></b>That caused Akane to deflate. "But... but the sign was <i>gone</i> when I checked! Otherwise I would have never walked in on the pervert!"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka was about to retort that Akane should stop insulting her son for no reason, but Nabiki interrupted her with her musings. "Hmm... the sign <i>was</i> out when I walked by... naturally! Dad and uncle... I bet they took the sign away to speed up the 'Joining of the schools'. Meh, amateurs!"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka looked at Nabiki. "What, you mean that my husband and Soun are responsible? Hmm, although my husband is right and it would be manly of my son to peek at his iinazuke, I think I'll have to talk to Genma about this." she said and fingered her ever-present katana.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma had gotten up and left the furo without a word, and Kasumi followed him. He had had enough. It had been a loooong day. Kasumi whereas sighed. Surely the new lumps Ranma had received courtesy of her youngest sister needed tending...</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
