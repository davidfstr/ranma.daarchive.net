No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 26: Evaluations</b></p><p><b></b>The surprise on the face of a certain redheaded martial artist must have been very obvious for a certain Shinto priest who was sitting beside her gave her a worried look. "Ranma, is everything alright?"</p><p><b></b>Said redhead shook herself out of her stupor and slowly nodded her head. "I'm just... surprised is all. Damn who would have thought!" she exclaimed as she scanned the text for a second time.</p><p><b></b>With patience born from millennia Katsuhito waited until his new granddaughter was finished. When she was she handed him the laptop wordlessly; surprise but also something else were prevalent on her face. The Shinto priest mused that it looked like relief. Filing away her reactions for later analysis he read the mail. The first thing he noticed was that it was from Nodoka; he had to smile at her username though. This one was new to him.</p><p>'<b>Katanalady... oh yes that fits her well.'</b> he thought and began to study the text of the mail.</p><p><b>To</b>: The wild child</p><p><b>From</b>: The Katanalady</p><p><b>Subject</b>: Your mail and much more</p><p><b></b>Hello my child,</p><p><b></b>First of all let me say... hurray and congratulations! I'm so happy for you and I have kept your secret. Not even Soun knows and I would never dream of telling your father. Although he can not make decisions for you any more he might do something stupid. Alas, Kami-sama knows he has a tendency for these things.</p><p><b></b>But on to happier things. I am so glad for you, my child. And I'm sure Kasumi will wait for you until you are ready. If she/he loves you as much as I think she/he will. I am really happy that you found your true love. I've prayed to Kami-sama that your love may hold for all eternity. But I have a good feeling about it. Call it a mother's intuition.</p><p><b></b>I've finally realised just how big of a mistake the engagement to Akane really was. She loved you, my child, and she still does. However your personalities just did not fit. I've discussed it with your father and he agrees... now. A relationship also needs some friction but per my observations the two of you quarrelled constantly. There is also no excuse for Akane always hitting you. But that is now being dealt with.</p><p><b></b>In fact Akane does now receive psychological treatment; and Elder Cologne is helping as well. That brings me to something that happened some time ago. The Tuesday after you two had left Elder Cologne and her protégés Shampoo and Mousse stopped by. There and then we did not know of your mail but the Elder explained everything in detail.</p><p><b></b>Now keep your hat on, daughter; at least I think you're currently my daughter as I've noticed that you were always more prone to express yourself as a girl which you did in your last mail; I hope you'll start to do the same thing as a boy in the future, my child.</p><p><b></b>It turned out that Shampoo did <i>not </i>poison Akane! She had planned to but she did not have the heart to do something that dishonourable. And Shampoo did not even have to make Akane angry enough to lose the engagement as something else did so much better.</p><p><b></b>We learned the reasons why Akane treated you the way she did and I must say that I feel for the poor girl. The main reason why she was so angry with you, my child was that she felt that you ripped her away from her mother. She told us that she had really died at Jusendo and that she was with her mother in heaven. Yet when you called out her name she was ripped away from Kimiko and brought back to Earth. She never really overcame the shock even though she tried to hide it but being around you constantly made her more and more angry. Things have been cleared up now and Akane understands.</p><p><b></b>But it also did not help that her mallet turned out to be an uncontrolled ki-attack. Elder Cologne wanted to write you a mail with a more detailed warning thus I'll tell you the basics, daughter. Akane's mallet is according to the Elder a ki-attack based on anger. The more often she used the mallet the angrier she became. It was a vicious circle and one that has been broken as of now, gladly.</p><p><b></b>The Elder has already begun to teach her several meditation techniques and also a technique you seem to have mastered yourself, the stuff space. Akane is quite fond of her mallet and to make it easier for her to stop using the ki-attack she has so gotten used to the Elder had the idea to teach the stuff space to Akane so that she could reach for another mallet she had stored there herself. Akane has accepted this and is willing to learn. As the alternative is too gruelling to even think about it she had virtually no other choice. Had the poor girl continued to use her mallet she might have even killed someone; in time she would have been so far gone in her anger that she might have gone on a rampage if something had ticked her off. Gladly that won't happen and we're all very relieved.</p><p><b></b>I'm really sorry for Akane, which I admit. She is such a nice girl but I understand that you won't go back to how it was. I saw it for myself before you left, daughter. There and then I thought that you might fall for Kasumi and that now that it has happened, now that you and Kasumi love each other… I could not be gladder. I will also take every precaution necessary so that your father does not learn of what is going on. He will especially have no part in bringing up future children I hope you two will have; that I promise to you on my honour and as the Head of Clan Saotome.</p><p><b></b>Your father has already ruined <i>your</i> life more than thoroughly and after I have now learned the true extent of what he has done to you I have started to… reeducate him. Yes, my child I know of the Neko-ken. Had I ever known what he planned to do to you in his foolishness and thoughtlessness I would have never let you leave. Yet I trusted your father with you and it seems that it was the worst decision I could have made. Only two good things came out of it, my child. You have become a truly wonderful martial artist and also the daughter I never had.</p><p><b></b>I must admit that I was really torn between abiding by the contract and accepting you as my daughter as well as my son. In the end my motherly love for you won and although my motherly instincts had gotten rusty they fought what I perceived as honour at that time. But had it not been for Kasumi I might still have the views of manliness that I had. I can not thank Kami-sama enough for the insight the person you love provided me with. Kasumi has my full approval as well as your wife as your husband. I could not wish for a better daughter-and-son-in-law than Kasumi. So if you ask her/him, you have my full support.</p><p><b></b>Know that I love you, my child. Many greetings from everyone. I have to end the mail now for a certain Mr. Panda just begs for another round of reeducation.</p><p><b></b>Love,<br/>Mom.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled to himself. It was good to read that his former student had punished her wayward husband for submitting their child to the torture that was the false Neko-ken. He only hoped it had really hurt. It was just too bad that he had not been there to help her.</p><p><b></b>Smiling further the old Shinto Priest analyzed the underlying message of the mail. Oh yes it seemed that Nodoka still wanted grandchildren as bad as ever. Inwardly the Shinto priest asked himself if Nodoka would care who would give birth to the first child. With an amused shake of the head he shook these thoughts from his mind. That was really something far off topic for the two as far as he could see; and besides, that decision was up to both Kasumi and Ranma and nobody else.</p><p><b></b>He viewed the two cursed individuals as persons with a lot of personal honour and such as the two would probably wait until the wedding night to consume their love. No, there were no worries here. Concentrating on the inbox Katsuhito noticed that Ranma had three further mails; of course he'd never open them without her approval. "I've read the mail, Ranma. It was good to read from your mother again as our correspondence stopped some time ago. As we had been quite busy ourselves I never got to check upon the reason why but I suspect it had to do with your father."</p><p><b></b>Ranma growled at that. "That's a safe bet, grandpa. Mom probably had no internet-access cause she could not pay the bills any more or something. Till today I have no idea just how many debts stupid pops created but I fear that quite a lot of bills landed on mom's doorstep. And I know mom; she is very honourable and I bet she paid all the bills. Grrr, just thinking about it creates the urge in me to rip the stupid panda to pieces. I hate what he did to mom and me." she said angrily. "But I'm really, really happy that Shampoo did not poison Akane. I would have felt really bad to have known that I had been the reason for that."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded. "I can understand that, granddaughter. But it would not have been your fault if she had done so; you're not responsible for her decision, she is. Just let it go." he said with a reassuring smile; a smile which vanished as he continued. "But your father seems to be able to create these feelings you described in a lot of people. I especially worry about your engagement to this Ukyo Kuonji, another fault of Genma's you have to pay for. As far as you said you do not want anything but friendship between you; yet she insists upon the engagement and wants to marry you at all costs. Don't let what I say now go to your head but its understandable. You are an exceptional person, Ranma. Kind, caring, brave and so much more. It is no wonder that you attract many suitors. But now that you have found your match it is time to initiate some damage control. And that's where little Washu comes in. I'm sure we'll come up with something between all of us." he said and leant over to ruffle her hair.</p><p><b></b>The redhead enjoyed that quite a bit and giggled quietly. It was something she would never have dreamed of doing a few weeks back, dropping her guard like that but now it just felt good. She was surrounded by people who cared for her and whom she could trust and vice versa. She wondered what would have happened had it been the same at the Tendo Dojo. Sure, it had been her home but there she'd always missed the support she was getting here. Here she could be more or less carefree, in contrast to Nerima.</p><p><b></b>That on the other hand brought a lot of dark thoughts and Ranma warded them off as fast as they had popped up. She was here to enjoy herself and that she would do from now on. Came there hell or high water. Now only her love had to heal but according to little Washu that would happen within the week. In one week at the latest he would be out of the tank, as good as new. It was an eternity for her but somehow she would manage.</p><p><b></b>She smiled as she thought about how the others were helping her to deal with the situation. At home, in Nerima she'd probably have been blamed for everything and been clobbered for good measure. Not so here. Yes, here people cared for her and that was a new feeling, a wholly new concept for her. Granted her mother had also cared a lot for her, especially ever since the failed wedding, but this was unconditional acceptance she came to know here… okay, not completely unconditional considering Ryoko.</p><p><b></b>But she felt that the two of them had come to terms somewhat. Their relationship now felt somewhat like the one she shared with Ryoga. Some sort of rivalling friendship. Which was good in her book; she always needed people who brought out the best in her and Ryoko had loads of potential. In fact the cyan-haired alien was strong and tough enough to keep up with her and once she had brought her speed up to acceptable levels she'd be even more of a challenge.</p><p><b></b>She felt that she could be good for Ryoko and vice versa. The thought of Ryoko reminded her of something. "Grandpa, where is everyone? It is so damn quiet here in the house."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito leant back in his chair. "Well, little Washu is in her lab doing Kami-sama knows what. Mihoshi has dragged Sasami onto yet another shopping trip; our resident Galaxy Police offer said that a good, long shopping trip was called for after all the action and agitation. Sasami was unfortunate enough to be in close proxy thus she got dragged off." here Ranma looked positively green at the idea that <i>she</i> could have been the one to be dragged off on such a trip. "That's also why there's a mountain of food as she made enough as a precaution until she's back. Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko are outside, trying to improve their style. They saw in the fight against the Android that they're lacking a lot and they've begun to train even harder than before. But I agree they'll need your help to improve their speed and style. Learning hand-to-hand from you will do them a world of good."</p><p><b></b>Ranma's eyes gleamed at the mention of training. Now that she had taken in a sufficient amount of food she felt like she could take on everything. Besides, training with the other three would also distract her from her worries. Especially if she would instruct them in the Art.</p><p><b></b>It really seemed that being female meant that one worried a lot more about a lot of things; at the moment she was worried about her love most of all. But as she had never been a person to sit in a corner and bite her nails off she decided to become active again. "Cool! If you'd excuse me… I'm gonna join them as soon as I have changed into better suited gear. Training… cool!" she exclaimed with excitement and wanted to get up when an acoustic message chirped that made her remain in place.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito on his part had overheard it as he had been lost in thought. The old Shinto priest knew that Ranma needed this training, or rather the opportunity to teach the most because she wanted to forget that her love was still healing from a near death-experience. Normally neither Washu nor he would have allowed Ranma to partake in the training sessions his three protégés normally held so soon after her ordeal; but he also knew that Ranma was extraordinarily tough and healed fast. This had become crystal clear after the additional tests little Washu had made after Ranma had fallen asleep. Her blood alone had answered a lot of questions and having visual proof of the healing rate she possessed it was safe for her to partake in the training.</p><p><b></b>Little Washu had made some very interesting postulations about what was still happening to Ranma. It seemed to be obvious now that she was indeed developing the same powers the Phoenix King Saffron possessed with one difference. Ranma also held a huge amount of ki and these two power sources were now intermixing and combining, were already on a good way in doing so as far as he could tell. And everyone who knew the theory that the sum was often larger than its parts knew what was happening. In simple terms Ranma was increasing in power more and more, maybe to a point where her powers would be able to compete with those of the Lighthawk wings.</p><p><b></b>Kami-sama knew that Ranma was one creative person and it was highly probable that she'd put these powers to good use. Heck, she had created ki-attacks based on moves from an Anime series! How probable was it there that she would be very inventive with her new powers? Yes, Ranma gave them a lot to think about. But unlike Kagato who had been a similar case she was good-hearted and fought to serve and protect. Ranma could become a very valuable ally to them as she had proven and he was proud to call her his granddaughter even if she was not of his or Juraian blood.</p><p><b></b>Shaking himself out of his musings he noticed that Ranma had grabbed the laptop instead of going upstairs to change. She had apparently a new mail to read; fact that had pushed the thoughts of training somewhat into the background. It was understandable too; he'd have wanted to be kept up to date with what was going on at home too. "Hmm… okay…" the redhead mumbled to herself as she apparently scan-read this particular mail.</p><p><b></b>Finally she looked up and nodded. "This mail is from Elder Cologne. She sent it on the same day she found out about Akane's mallet being a ki-attack; she describes how it works and urges me to come up with another form of ki-attack. I wonder why it took so long to appear in my inbox? Probably the server down once more or something." she muttered. "You know, grandpa, I based my old Moko Takabisha on confidence-ki. But now that I have these new powers it has started to intermix with my power-centre. Which had the effect that my ki-attacks are now quite safe for me." she said with a grin that said 'but not for those unfortunate enough to be at the receiving end'.</p><p><b></b>She handed the laptop to Katsuhito once more and the old Shinto Priest read it. Once he was finished he nodded. "Had you showed me your pure form of the Moko Takabisha you mentioned I could have told you the same thing. I've learned a lot in my 2,000 years of existence and ki-manipulation and detection is among it; I think I'll even be able to show you a trick or the other. But it is good that you're not in danger any more. Kami-sama knows that you have enough on your plate already."</p><p><b></b>The redhead could only nod. "You can say that again, grandpa." she said as she helped herself to something more to eat. Reading had made her hungry.</p><p><b></b>The Shinto Priest looked over her inbox, frowned and handed the laptop back to his new granddaughter. "Here, Ranma. If I saw right you have yet another three mails to be read. They seem to be recent."</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded while accepting her laptop. Placing it in front of her while sipping her tea she opened the first message. It was from Cologne and did not tell her anything new; the Elder has asked however to which address to forward the soap and thus Ranma wrote a quick reply that provided the necessary details.</p><p><b></b>The next message was a junk-mail that got deleted quickly. The last message, however, proved to be very interesting as it was from her mother. Looking at the date she saw that it had been composed today; opening it she saw that it had been written only two hours ago. Curious as hell Ranma began to read the message.</p><p><b>To</b>: The wild child</p><p><b>From</b>: The Katanalady</p><p><b>Subject</b>: Important news</p><p><b></b>Hello my child,</p><p><b></b>we have received word that your other legitimate fiancée (or is that fiancé, considering that she is legally a boy and you're my daughter? Don't worry, just teasing, dear!), Ukyo Kuonji, is aware of your location. According to Nabiki she has hired a private eye who managed to follow your track. From what we know she has left Nerima and is now headed for Okayama. We have no idea when she'll arrive but you better prepare.</p><p><b></b>Love,</p><p>Mom.</p><p><b></b>Ranma stared for a few seconds. Then she shook her head. That was just great. Why had everything in her life the tendency to blow up in her face? Considering her luck it was a given that Ukyo had no idea that she had fallen for Kasumi, and fallen as hard as one could. No, she did not look forward to meeting Ukyo. Why did she have to tell her best childhood-friend that she did not feel anything more but friendship towards her, which would surely break her heart? Why did everything always have to be so complicated? With a sigh she composed an answer in which she thanked her mother for the warning. It was quite short and to the point, but she wanted to find another way to talk to her mother anyway.</p><p><b></b>Banning her worries concerning Ukyo into the far recesses of her mind she concentrated on more pleasant things. "So, now I'm gonna train the others and when I'm done I'm gonna ask Washu-chan what we can do about mom and Mr. Tendo. See ya later!" she exclaimed and bounded away.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito looked after her and smiled to himself. Despite all that had happened to her in her short life she had not lost her energy or her will to live and take on everything that came her way; rather the contrary was the case. Yes, Ranma was truly the child of Nodoka, he mused to himself.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>A little while later a redhead clad in a black tank-top and blue spandex came downstairs again, a big smile on her face. Katsuhito noticed her mood in an instant and was quite certain that she had found out. "So you noticed now, did you, Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl grinned. She had had to use the bathroom and one look in the mirror and she'd indeed noticed. "You bet I did, you sly fox! Grrr, you could have <i>told</i> me that I had grown! And four inches to boot! Finally I'm not the midget any more!" she exclaimed in jest. Yup, being 5'4'' now was not so bad all. So that had been why the ground had seemed to be farther away than before. It <i>had</i> been! And she had thought she had hallucinated! Damn, the happenings as of late had really screwed her perceptions, or else she would have noticed something like that. In the future she'd pay more attention to her body, that she vowed to herself.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled back. "Yes, I <i>could</i> have told you. But wasn't it much better that you found out on your own, Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma walked over to the old man and gave him a playful punch to the shoulder. "Oh you! But you're right; it <i>is</i> better that I found out myself. And damn do I look better this way! Man it's so cool that this body has finally grown somewhat! Granted I'm still not as tall as my male form and probably never will be but it's a start. Now I only have to gain some weight so that I don't look like a female version of that skinny kid I read about in that book about magic and stuff… you know, Harry Potter. His evil relatives nearly starved him to death and that instantly reminded me of stupid pops and his idiotic speed training. I felt for the kid even though it was just a novel. But a real cool one!"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded. "Yes, I have heard of Harry Potter too. The series is quite popular over in the States and in Europe; however I never read a single book up till now. You say they're good?"</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded empathically. "In former times I'd have given a damn about it. But ever since I got cursed at Jusenkyo and got firsthand proof that magic exists I was fascinated. And when I found out about that Harry Potter book I bought it and read it in secret. Stupid pops would have scolded me for reading something that was so idiotic and unmanly in his opinion but I liked the book. This J. K. Rowling is a real imaginative person to have thought up a world like this and I like the way she writes and describes things. Wonder what she'd say if she knew that magic really exists?" she mused with a slight smile.</p><p><b></b>The Shinto priest shared the smile. "Who knows, maybe this author knows more than we do, eh?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked at him and grinned. "Yeah, who knows?" she said finally. "Grandpa, I'm ready to train and show the others how it's done properly. See ya later!" she exclaimed with her trademark smirk.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled at this. It was good to see Ranma ready to take part in the training; but he mused that had it not been for Washu and her fantastic medical equipment that his new granddaughter would have been worried sick over her love. Who wouldn't have been in her place? But luckily Washu's facilities were as good as they were and Ranma had nothing to worry about. "All right. Have fun, young lady." he said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>The redhead winced somewhat at the young lady comment but shrugged it off a few moments later. She'd accepted that she would be in female form for the next three months, even though she was still struggling with the concept that she was as much female as male. But she'd give it a try, for her love, her mother and herself. Shaking herself out of her musings she noticed that Katsuhito had busied himself with the newspaper and smiling to herself in face of some intense training she headed outside.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Walking purposefully Ranma soon reached the area where Tenchi, Ryoko and Ayeka were training, her keen hearing following the sounds of combat. Considering their powers it was a wise precaution to take the training outside and the lake she was headed for now actually offered a natural buffer if they got too carried away.</p><p><b></b>Standing in the background, unnoticed by the others Ranma evaluated the three warriors; for that was what they were, no martial artists but warriors. Something she might become too if she took up the offer of Katsuhito aka Yosho. Besides what they had done in their fight against the Android had little in common with sports. While watching and evaluating the others with one half of her mind Ranma sat down on the ground and engrossed herself in her thoughts with the other half, evaluating herself.</p><p><b></b>For her martial arts had always been just that, hadn't it? A sport. It had always been a competition with the others; Kuno, Mousse, Ryoga, the girls and even with people like Ryu Kumon and so many others. Seldom had it been a fight to the death. Sure the others had often <i>claimed</i> that they wanted her dead but would anyone aside from Herb or Saffron and a select few really have had the guts to kill her? Sure, Kuno <i>had</i> wanted to kill her male half time and time again but he was a nut-job and did not really count.</p><p><b></b>Ryoga for his part had really hated her in the past and <i>he</i> could have killed her during the fiasco with the Koi-rod. She still remembered with dread how she had offered to Ryoga that he could kill her if that made him happy. Yet there and then Ryoga had proven that he could not really kill her; their relationship had always been one of discrepancies and only lately thanks to her love and to what had happened at Jusendo they were approaching something that could be called a tentative friendship.</p><p><b></b>Yes, Jusendo had been a turning point in many regards. From her fight with Saffron on things had begun to change, hadn't they? Before she'd always strived to be the best, to come out on top in various competitions; but the fight against Saffron had taken place on a wholly different level. That had been a real fight to the death, no simple competition.</p><p><b></b>As had been her recent fight against that Android. She also had to admit to herself that she had never felt that much hate before for anyone or anything as in the fight against the mechanical monstrosity; there and then she had justified her intent to kill with an overwhelming want to take revenge and the fact that the Android had been just a machine.</p><p><b></b>But did it really make a difference if one killed an Android or a living person? Wasn't the end result the same? An existence wiped out? Couldn't the Android have grown beyond what it had been programmed with like Zero? With a sigh she shook herself out of these fruitless musings. She could not change what had happened thus it was entirely fruitless to engross herself in speculations of what she could have done differently. Kasumi had worded it best some time ago: we can't change what has happened, we only can influence what can happen.</p><p><b></b>Yet she knew in the back of her head that she'd have to reconsider some things about her; she had already done some things that she'd vowed she'd never do as a martial artist. A martial artist protected the weak and served to defend; only if there was really no other option it was allowed to kill an opponent in self-defence. Technically she had done just that but the fact remained that she had taken two lives; even if one had regenerated and hatched again as a baby and the other had been artificial.</p><p><b></b>Those actions of hers did not comply with her views of what a martial artist should be, however. Her latest fights had changed from competitions to fights to the death; and those fights had also changed <i>her</i> which was actually unsurprising. She did not feel like a martial artist any more but what was she? Yet she did not know. The only thing she did know for sure was that she was really considering taking up the offer her new grandfather had made, for he'd made some good points. But if she did that, wouldn't she cease to be a martial artist?</p><p><b></b>With yet another sigh she got into a standing position and the other half of her mind told her what it had observed. It was time to engage in some training to shoo away her inner demons.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>It was however quite hard to get the attention of the others and at first Ranma did not try; rather she limited herself to watch the fight with her full attention. Ryoko and Ayeka fought in an unusual team against Tenchi and Ranma actually had a chance to see the famous Lighthawk wings in action. During the fight with the Android she had not had a chance to pay as much attention to them as she wanted but now she could get a closer look. And boy did Tenchi look impressive with that armour and sword of his!</p><p><b></b>Ryoko had her own energy sword out and was currently fencing with Tenchi while Ayeka was firing her energy blasts at the raven-haired youth; these blasts were however blocked by some kind of shield. It was plainly obvious that Tenchi was in the advantage which was probably due to the countless hours he had spent with his grandfather in training. Yes, she mused, if she wanted to learn the way of the sword Katsuhito would probably be the very best choice. Yet another reason why she should take him up on the offer.</p><p><b></b>From seeing how Tenchi wielded his weapon to the style he exhibited she suspected that she could learn a lot; yet as of now she was still torn between the teachings of her father, as stupid as they were and the need and want to follow at least somewhat in the footsteps of her mother.</p><p><b></b>Shaking herself out of her musings she called herself to order and concentrated on what lay ahead. Per her evaluation Tenchi was very good with his sword; it also helped that it was energised by his internal energies which would make it impossible to disarm him. Yet another advantage in a fight. Hmm, maybe she could really try something like that once she came more to grips with her powers. Also the promise of Ryoko to teach her how to make the energy sword still rang in her ears and made her grin.</p><p><b></b>To learn new techniques was one of the greatest things. A sword powered by her own internal energies… that would mean that she could not he disarmed. Yes, learning the Juraian sword-style from Katsuhito sounded better the more often she thought about it. Seeing how Tenchi dominated Ryoko in the sword-fight nearly decided her internal conflict if she should take to learning the way of the sword there and then. The ex-space pirate was clearly in the defence and only Ayeka's interference saved her at this point.</p><p><b></b>This brought her evaluation to Ryoko. Sure, the alien was tough and strong but she definitely lacked speed, style and technique. To put it bluntly she seemed to be largely untrained. But she had got tons of potential to build upon and what she lacked in those other categories she made more than up with her determination and obstinacy.</p><p><b></b>Taking a good look how Ryoko's ki flared especially high as she blocked a sword-strike of Tenchi; Ranma noticed that the ex-space pirate seemed to focus her whole ki through the jewellery she wore. Before she had been too caught up in her fights with either the real Ryoko or the fake one to make a detailed analysis but now she had a clear look at things.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko's ki felt about as weird as that of Tenchi, Ayeka and Katsuhito; it marked her as not of this world as Ranma now knew. Ryoko's ki was also different from that of the others. That she focussed it through those gems was the difference and that might make her dependable on those gems. Which might prove disadvantageous in the long run.</p><p><b></b>Nodding to herself Ranma vowed to find out what the exact purpose of those gems was. For if Ryoko used those gems to focus her powers she might get problems in the future. She had planned to teach some ki-building techniques to the others assuming that their ki could be raised. But as she had no clues towards the contrary she'd teach them and see what would happen.</p><p><b></b>But she'd have to find out how those gems affected Ryoko. She had no idea what the maximum capacity of those jewels was and it just would not do if those things blew up simply because she had not had enough knowledge about the matter. Nope, she'd never run off half-cooked like her stupid father had done so often in the past. Never would she endanger her students overly.</p><p><b></b>Well, that left her evaluation of Ayeka. In her opinion the princess was relying too much on her powers. Sure, her energy blasts were impressive and all and her shield surely useful. She was without a doubt powerful but she would benefit greatly from some more skills in hand-to-hand. The ki-building techniques she had planned for the three would also not hurt her.</p><p><b></b>Now the first thing she'd have to do was to get their speed up. Ranma mused to herself that Tenchi could outclass her completely with his Juraian powers but what if he ran into someone or something that was immune to those powers or could counter them like that Android? What if he ran into someone else with that kind of power?</p><p><b></b>Relying on only one thing was a bad idea, that she had learned lately; that was also why she was giving the thought how she wanted to maintain a family in the future great relevance. In reality she had no idea of the financial status of her Clan but what with her father she had to assume the worst. That meant that she'd have to earn the big Yen by herself which had led her to the thought that her martial arts and teaching at a Dojo (most probably the Tendo Dojo) might not necessarily be the only and best way.</p><p><b></b>But those thoughts were for later; now she'd do what she'd always wanted to do. Teach students. And hopefully she'd be just as good at teaching as she was at fighting.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Now that she'd seen enough of the powers of the others Ranma decided to take the matters of training into her own hands. Stepping closer to them she left her observing position and made her presence known with a cough. Instantly three heads turned towards her and the fighting ceased.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi smiled at his childhood-friend and let the armour and sword disappear; Ayeka directed a friendly but regal look her way. Ranma mused that it must be really tiring to always act the princess-part and despite all the privileges she might have Ranma would never want to change places with Ayeka.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko on her part was smirking mischievously at her; the smirk told her that it was nice to see her up and about but at the same time it said 'What has taken you so long?'</p><p><b></b>She walked towards the three and Ayeka and Ryoko, being women and thus more observant than Tenchi noticed it instantly. "Say… something is different about ya, Red."</p><p><b></b>Ayeka agreed. "Yes, it seems as if you have… grown?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned and blushed while she suppressed a delighted look. "That's because I have!" she exclaimed and let the delight she felt at the fact finally shine through. "No longer am I so short so that I could be mistaken for a kid. And that feels great!"</p><p><b></b>Now Tenchi butted in as he too had finally noticed. "Hey, Ranma, congrats! Must have been pretty darn annoying to be so short in your female form, huh?"</p><p><b></b>"Tenchi!" Ayeka reprimanded. "One does not say such disrespectful things towards a woman!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi blushed and stammered; Ranma however waved it off. "Nah, no prob. I don't mind, Tenchi. B'sides you're right; it <i>is</i> darn annoying to be so much shorter and lighter than my male form. But it seems as if things are setting themselves straight ever so slowly. I can tell ya that it feels great to be at least somewhat taller." she said with a grin.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka on her part looked at her rival. "She's got no pride in herself and acts way too much like a boy. We have to remedy this."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko nodded. "Yeah but we ain't gonna make a lady outta her. She'll be a right tomboy at best." she stated.</p><p><b></b>The first crown-princess bit back the comment that lay on the tip of her tongue. Instead she nodded. "Most probably. But we shall see about that."</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part was looking from one girl to the next and presented warding signs. "Eep! I'm just here ta train with ya! Don't wanna be stuffed inta some skirt or nothing!"</p><p><b></b>Ayeka laid a hand around her shoulder. "Don't worry, Ranma. We will help you become a girl. Isn't that right, Ryoko?"</p><p><b></b>The ex-space pirate nodded. "Ya betcha. Red, we'll gonna make ya the kinda gal yer love can impossibly resist."</p><p><b></b>The redhead eeped once more and sent a pleading look at Tenchi; her childhood-friend however just shrugged his shoulders in a gesture of helplessness and his facial expression said that she was on her own in this. Mouthing 'traitor' at him she tried to distract the girls. "Hey ya two I wanted ta plan with ya how ta make yer speed-training. We can talk about anythin' else later." <b>'A lot later! Maybe when I'm forty?'</b> she added mentally.</p><p><b></b>Thankfully her diversion worked as Ryoko, Ayeka and even the 'traitor' looked very interested. Ranma sat down on the ground and the others followed her example. "Tenchi, I noticed in the fight with the Android that you couldn't use your… ki as you would normally. That thing seemed to be able to block it somehow. Am I right to assume that you can use your Juraian powers to increase your strength and speed?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi nodded. "Among other things. I can use my Juraian powers to do what you described and I can form three Lighthawk wings with them. You already saw the shield, armour and the sword. However as you saw they were quite useless against the Android. But what can I do against it?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl smiled. She had already thought about it. "Well you could change the frequency of your ki. From my scan of your aura I know that your ki consists of both human ki and something else that I assume is your Juraian ki; its good that your ki is a mixture of both otherwise it would have been more complicated. With enough ki-training you will be able to change the frequency of your ki so that something like what happened yesterday can't happen again. However learning those techniques will take some time." she said with a sigh. "If only there was a way to speed things up… or to do it like the warriors in Dragonball Z… that timechamber would really be cool." she mused.</p><p><b></b>The raven-haired youth nodded while Ayeka and Ryoko absorbed this. "But what can we do in the meantime? Isn't there some way to enhance my natural speed and that of Ayeka and Ryoko?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma's smile deepened. "As far as I see it you're a normal if skilled human when you don't access your Juraian powers, right?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi nodded and Ranma continued. "Then it is more than just possible to enhance your natural speed. The same goes for you, Ayeka, Ryoko. There is a technique I had to learn in order to beat Elder Cologne when she tried to blackmail me into marrying Shampoo."</p><p><b></b>"What did she do ta ya, Red?" Ryoko asked.</p><p><b></b>The redhead sighed and launched herself into an explanation of the cat's tongue incident that had led to the fight for the Phoenix pill; she also described how she had learned the Kachuu Tenshin Amaguriken. "She did that to you, Ranma? And despite that you're allies with her and her tribe? Had someone done that to me I would have blasted them into the next dimension!" Ayeka exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>"Ya got that right, princess!" Ryoko exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi had remained silent as he assumed that Ranma had her reasons for that. And Ranma had. "You know, that was in the beginning when she'd just come over from China. The old ghoul as I called her back then was just too set in her ways. You know they've got this really strange set of rules they live by or used to live by." she began and in the following minutes she explained the outsider rules to the other three.</p><p><b></b>When she was finished with the statement that Elder Cologne had promised to banish the outsider rules completely three "About times" chorused. Ranma nodded. "I <i>hated</i> these disgusting laws and it's good that Elder Cologne was not overly fond of them either. What happened to Shampoo was just the straw that broke the back of the camel and she did her all to throw these stupid rules onto the rubbish heap of history. Ya know mainly I accepted to become an ally of their tribe cause I wanted ta have them off my back with a way so that Shampoo could keep her honour. She's done a lot of stupid things but she did them outta love. I really didn't want to see her gettin' hurt so I accepted the pact with my conditions. Actually Elder Cologne ain't so bad; she taught me a lot of stuff and now that the bout with being her 'son-in-law' is over she's actually helpful."</p><p><b></b>The others nodded in understanding but Ryoko snickered. "Heh heh heh… at the moment ya'd be more of a <i>daughter</i>-in-law, Red!" she exclaimed between guffaws.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked indignant and wanted to retort but Ayeka lay at hand on her arm. "Don't, Ranma. It would neither be dignified nor lady-like."</p><p><b></b>The redhead looked at her with wide eyes and sweatdropped. Damn! It seemed as if Ayeka would really be on her case what with being lady-like. And Ryoko knew it too as her fresh bout of snickers proved. Man that would be some months here! Sighing dejectedly she nodded towards Ayeka. "A… nyway I had ta learn that speed-technique to overcome the Elder; it's the one you saw me use against Ryoko and that evil Android. Very useful but not easy ta learn cause its painful."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi looked at her with interest as did the other girls. "How did you learn it, Ranma?" the grandson of Katsuhito asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma grimaced. "Ya know there's more than one way ta learn it. One is ta pick chestnuts outta a bowl while they're been roasted over a fire. As I couldn't stand any heat at that time that wasn't an option. The father of my love, Soun Tendo suggested I go to the carnival to distract myself. That I did. Akane 'n me went there 'n she tried ta catch kois. However she was too… umm…" she trailed off, trying to find a polite way to describe Akane's clumsiness.</p><p><b></b>"Klutzy?" supplied Ryoko, ever the one to be blunt.</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded. "That. Thus <i>I</i> tried; and I was already not so bad regarding speed thus I managed to catch quite a lot of koi. However to win I had ta catch live piranha with my bare hands! And without any protection ta boot!" she said with a serious expression which then changed into a grin. "Ta make a long story short in the end I succeeded."</p><p><b></b>Needless to say the other three were bug-eyed. "Umm… is there any other way to become faster?" Tenchi asked.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka nodded. "That sounds not like something a princess should do…"</p><p><b></b>Only Ryoko shrugged her shoulders. "Been through worse. I'd go for that chestnuts outta the fire pickin' thing. But maybe Washu can help us here if our little princess is too scared…" she teased.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka just rolled her eyes and snorted "Grow up."</p><p><b></b>"I grew up a long time ago." retorted Ryoko.</p><p><b></b>"Then grow up some more." countered Ayeka with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>"Not before you." grinned Ryoko, wanting to have the last word out of general principles.</p><p><b></b>"Are you 7, or 17?" she muttered.</p><p><b></b>"Physically 17, mentally…well, my therapist won't look me in the eyes so…" Ryoko trailed off.</p><p><b></b>"Very funny, Ryoko." Ayeka said and scowled. "It's undignified for a princess of Jurai to bicker thus I'll not lower myself to this level. The cleverer give in."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko only smirked. "So you admit defeat, princess?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma had watched this exchanged with interest and amusement, and her expression had said 'Are they often like this?' while Tenchi had just shrugged his shoulders and rolled his eyes. Knowing that the situation could escalate despite the fact that Ryoko and Ayeka had undoubtedly made progress Tenchi added his own comment just in time to prevent an exchange of profanities between the first crown princess of Jurai and the ex-space pirate. "Ryoko's suggestion is a risk but asking <i>her</i> might be our only option. To be honest, Ranma, I'm not fond of both alternatives you suggested as they pose too great a risk for injuries."</p><p><b></b>Ranma raised a brow. "Tenchi, injuries will remind ya that ya did something wrong; they also remind ya that yer still alive. Believe me pain can be a great teacher." she said with hooded eyes. "There're also some ways to increase your overall speed I'm going to teach you but they won't be a bed of roses. But in the end you'll be loads better for it, I guarantee it."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko, Ayeka and Tenchi shared a look. Then the three nodded. For Ranma they'd give it a try but they'd slow her down should she try to do anything like her father had done to her; not that she'd do it voluntarily but maybe she wouldn't be able to help it seeing as she'd never been taught otherwise.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi spoke up for them. "Okay. We will do it; and I'd say I speak for all of us that we'll be using the chestnuts-variant should Lil' Washu not come up with something else. Personally I like my fingers attached to my hands, thank you very much. Ryoko, could you contact Lil' Washu and ask her to meet us in the main room? Thanks." he said with a smile, not noticing the effect it had on Ryoko.</p><p><b></b>Said ex-space pirate blushed somewhat and used her link to relate what Tenchi wanted. Some moments later Ryoko was back to reality. "Man was she grumpy. Betcha she was busy going over the data she got on ya, Red. But she'll meet us in the main room in two hours. Said she'd turn all of us into Denebian slugs if we disturbed her again within the next two hours."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded, simply ignoring Washu-chan's behaviour. Seemed to be par for the course anyway. She was however quite satisfied that her new students saw the need to undergo some pain in the name of training. But she'd make sure that it would be nothing like what her father had put <i>her</i> through. That she'd vowed on her honour.</p><p><b></b>In the time they had to themselves until Washu-chan would have time for them Ranma began to instruct the others in the basic moves of the Anything Goes style and pointed out the flaws she'd detected and showed them how it was done correctly. The redhead was happy to see that her three students took to the Art like fish to water.</p><p><b></b>As she had surmised Ayeka was the most advanced of her three pupils regarding the Art but Tenchi and Ryoko displayed their adaptability; especially Ryoko was very motivated seeing that Ranma had promised her a rematch at any time she wanted.</p><p><b></b>To say that both girls were looking forward to that would have been an understatement. The brief spar they had engaged in while Tenchi and Ayeka had been sparring had been nothing more than an appetiser and Ranma had used the opportunity to point out the flaws in Ryoko's defence.</p><p><b></b>Satisfied that Ryoko followed her advice and avoided making the same mistakes again she made good on her promise, earlier than Ryoko had hoped for. But Ranma had planned the rematch as a good opportunity to show the cyan-haired girl that she had a long ways to go.</p><p><b></b>After she had pointed out the flaws in Tenchi's and Ayeka's defence and helped eliminate them she let the two spar with each other while she and Ryoko were having their rematch. As Ranma planned to show Ryoko that the other girl would need to train hard to improve to levels were she would be able to hold her own against her she planned not to hold back in the slightest; she'd make use of her speed-advantage to the fullest.</p><p><b></b>Besides, she still had to test out her increased strength. The beating she planned to dish out to Ryoko would also have the effect that Ryoko would try so much harder to become better. And a motivated student whose goal it was to beat you would learn so much better. A win-win-situation, as far as a certain redhead was concerned.</p><p><b></b>Thus, over the course of the next thirty minutes Ranma proceeded to give Ryoko yet another sound trashing during which she also lived up to her ambition to be a sensei through pointing out why she had been able to penetrate Ryoko's defences after the match and what she, Ryoko could do against it.</p><p><b></b>The ex-space pirate had indeed been soundly defeated in the end, even though she had used a lot of her special techniques, but Ranma was proud of her; Ryoko was a fast learner and with some speed-training which would hopefully begin soon she'd be able to improve dramatically.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part looked forward to branch out the Anything Goes Style into a full-air Art instead of the mid-air Art it had been limited to until now; but considering her new ability to fly and considering that Ryoko could fly too she'd be able to take the Anything Goes Style to a wholly new level. Granted, that could only be done once Ryoko had caught up to a decent level but hopefully that would not take too long. The redhead's eyes glinted in face of all the possibilities.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi and Ayeka would also be easy to teach seeing as they had fought so many battles before; all three were professionals and listened intently to what she had to teach them. All in all the first light training session had been very promising and Ranma could hardly wait to teach them the Anything Goes style in its entireness, complaints of Master Happosai be damned. Besides, what he did not know wouldn't hurt him. And if he <i>should</i> find out by chance she could still challenge Happosai for the title of Grandmaster of the school. With her abilities she should be able to cream him any time.</p><p><b></b>Satisfied with the progress of her pupils the four ended the session, seeing as the two hours were over. As Ranma analyzed the training she smiled to herself. It was a good thing that her new students didn't have their heads in the clouds regarding their own abilities for it would make teaching them so much easier. In short order they'd worked out a training schedule that was satisfying to all participants. The full training would either start this afternoon or tomorrow, depending on what Washu-chan would come up with.</p><p><b></b>Together the four youths made their way back to the house, unsure of what to expect from Washu but filled with anticipation. Meetings with her were always bound to be interesting.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group. I enjoy reading your comments, and the suggestions you all make will help to make this story even better.</p><p>If you find anything illogical that might have created a plot-hole or anything else that is wrong, let me know and I'll fix it.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
