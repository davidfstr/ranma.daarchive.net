No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 17: Revelations and the arrival</b></p><p><b>Nerima, roughly two weeks ago…</b></p><p><b>The Nekohanten</b></p><p><b></b>It was the late Tuesday evening when Cologne had finally returned to Nerima. She had used the good opportunity to harvest some of the valuable herbs that grew in the area around the Mlao plains and she had also enjoyed the peace and quiet. To be honest, her great-granddaughter and that annoying male Mu-Tzu could be quite a handful and to say that they grated on her nerves from time to time would be the truest statement ever.</p><p><b></b>Right now her Xian-Pu was the one who was grating on her nerves the most. For everything pointed into the direction that she had indeed used the fèi zeng jìn dú pin. That could have very undesirable consequences for her great-granddaughter. For also the Japanese had the concept of a blood-feud and should her Xian-Pu have really poisoned Tendo Akane, who knew how the Tendos would react. After all, both father and youngest child were not known for their patience.</p><p><b></b>Finally opening the side-door Cologne entered her restaurant. Checking the building for ki she noticed that nobody was there. Hobbling inside on her staff Cologne sat her huge backpack on the ground and began to make herself a strong tea. She had the hunch that she'd need one.</p><p><b></b>When she was done she pogoed back into the restaurant area and she noticed the letter which was lying on one of the tables. She went over to read it and it stated in short and precise Mandarin that Mousse and her great-granddaughter were busy making deliveries.</p><p><b></b>Apparently two local and rivalling companies had decided to sponsor concurring conventions and both companies had ordered food for the occasion. And not any food, but traditional Chinese food. Which was quite okay with Cologne as it would mean extra earnings for them. Hmm, maybe she'd be able to get the new upgrades she wanted for her notebook…</p><p><b></b>Away from the tribe it was always so difficult to get good new components as they were much more expensive. But that would matter at another time. First she had to check if her great-granddaughter and Mousse had catalogued and stored the herbs and fungi she'd sent them out to retrieve correctly. Thus she grabbed her backpack and hobbled into her own room to store the examples of Japanese flora she had collected into the designated cupboards.</p><p><b></b>As those herbs and fungi had a low 'security classification' the two young Joketsozuku had been able to catalogue and store them, and apparently they had done so correctly. "Well, it's a relief that they managed to do at least this." she muttered to herself.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly her ki-senses flared up and the Elder noticed the presence of two familiar kis. Yes, her great-granddaughter and Mousse were apparently back. Good. Now it was time to confront her great-granddaughter and if she really had done what the evidence indicated it would be time for damage control and an apology. And a few prayers to Aphrodite that the Tendos would not start a (justified) blood-feud.</p><p><b></b>Pogoing back downstairs Elder Cologne reached the restaurant area just in time to see how Xian-Pu stored the money she had made. Mu-Tzu was his usual self and leered at her. Well, in reality he was leering at the new statue in the corner but that was beside the point.</p><p><b></b>Being the warrior that she is Xian-Pu noticed the approach of her great-grandmother. Her face turned solemn and formal. °<i>Hello honoured great-grandmother. It is good to see you back in excellent health.</i>° she said in Mandarin and with a polite bow.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded in reply but her expression remained stern. Fact that did not go unnoticed by the two youths. "Hey old mummy, what's with the sour face? Did Saotome finally die on you and made the way free for me?" Mu-Tzu asked.</p><p><b></b>°<i>Silence!</i>° Kuh Lon exclaimed and bopped him hard on the head with her staff. °<i>What comes now is much too important for joking around, Mu Tzu, so keep your tongue in check.</i>°</p><p><b></b>Mu Tzu noticed the tone of voice Kuh Lon had spoken in and he immediately noticed that it would not be a good idea to make the Elder angry. °<i>My apologies, Elder. Do you want me to leave?</i>°</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon shook her head. °<i>What I have to say now is also for your ears, and I will need a witness.</i>° Then she turned her head away from the surprised Mu Tzu and towards her great-granddaughter. Her face grew even sterner. °<i>Xian-Pu, I am ashamed of your behaviour. To use underhanded tricks after I forbade them is not how a warrior should act. After I had deemed the usage of poisons, herbs and other related means dishonourable you should have pursued Ranma the way our ancestors did. With all your heart, mind, spirit and body. That you used the fèi zeng jìn dú pin makes matters much worse. You do realise that this could cause a blood-feud with the Tendos, which is something that would direct undesirable attention towards our tribe? I will have to punish you, great-granddaughter.</i>°</p><p><b></b>Xian Pu looked incredulous at her great-grandmother while Mu Tzu boggled. His Xian Pu should have done <i>what</i>? °<i>Whatever are you talking about, great-grandmother? It's true that I wanted to use this poison to make that violent girl lose the engagement to my Ranma before she actually managed to <b>kill</b> him, but I never did. That seemed dishonourable even to me so I continued to make her angry the old-fashioned way. And it worked like a charm.</i>°</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon nearly fell off her staff. °<i>You mean to tell me that you did <b>not</b> use the fèi zeng jìn dú pin? Then where is it? Can you <b>prove</b> that you did not use it? I'm also missing one of the blowtubes and one of the special arrows. And make no mistake, great-granddaughter, I'll notice if they were used.</i>° she said with a stern expression.</p><p><b></b>Her great-granddaughter nodded and reached into her stuff-space from which she recovered the utensils in question. She handed them to her great-grandmother who instantly inspected them on the table of one of the booths, and that quite thoroughly. What she found out surprised her. Xian-Pu <i>had</i> told the truth. She had indeed <i>not</i> used the poison, for the packages were still sealed.</p><p><b></b>And Kuh Lon knew that those seals were still intact and had not been tampered with. After all, she had sealed them herself and placed some of her ki in place to prove any breaches. These had not been tampered with, and also the blowtube and arrow were unused. With disbelief she turned to her great-granddaughter. °<i>Holy Aphrodite, that does mean that the anger the young Tendo displayed was all her own! Then there is only one explanation… yes! That I did not see it much earlier! Come with me, children, we have to get to the Tendos!</i>°</p><p><b>-.-</b></p><p><b></b>With that cryptic statement Kuh Lon used her staff to pogo out of the building closely followed by Xian-Pu and Mu Tzu. All three took to the rooftops, and minutes later the Amazon trio reached the Tendo Dojo, place of many conflicts but also solutions, and sacral home of the Tendos.</p><p><b></b>The three Amazons made themselves known at the frontgate rather than to Bakusai Tenketsu the wall like Xian-Pu had done so often in the past. This was a formal and official visit and they didn't want to give anyone the wrong impression.</p><p><b></b>Moments later Soun Tendo arrived at the front gate and opened it after he had overcome his initial surprise. "Elder Cologne," he said with a polite bow, "to what do we owe the honour of your visit?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>Cologne indicated a small bow. "It would be better if we discussed this inside, Tendo Soun."</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch nodded. It was the polite thing to do. "But of course, Elder Cologne. You know the way." he said with a small smile.</p><p><b></b>With that the Soun led up the way to the house, closely followed by three Amazons. Two of them wondered what in Aphrodites' name had happened now and how it was related to Ranma. The Tendo patriarch led the Amazons into the living room and the four sat down. Genma, who was sitting at the Shogi board looked up and nodded curtly, while Akane and Nabiki came down from upstairs, as they had heard the door go. Nodoka, who had been working out with her katana in the dojo came too.</p><p><b></b>A towel was hanging around her shoulders and she was wearing a black tank-top and black spandex. Fact, that made her look even more like her part-time-daughter as it accentuated her figure in the right´ ways. The Saotome matriarch greeted the visitors with a polite bow and the Amazons reciprocated the greeting in kind.</p><p><b></b>Once everyone was seated Cologne began her explanation as to why they were here. "I'll come right to the point. Tendo Akane, I had just reason to believe that you had been poisoned by my great-granddaughter." she said and held up her tiny hands to forestall any further-going comments than the common "WHAT!"</p><p><b></b>"Yes, when I checked my stockings I noticed, that a batch of the fèi zeng jìn dú pin, a blowtube and a special arrow were missing. This in addition to Tendo Akane's behaviour in the past months after Jusendo was evidence enough for me. Or so I thought."</p><p><b></b>"WHAT!" Akane yelled, "It wasn't my fault that I lost the engagement to Ranma? It was that bimbos?" she asked with a growl and got up, teeth bared.</p><p><b></b>Not even her medication could help to keep her temper in check now, for now she had proof that it hadn't been her fault. That stupid bimbo was at fault! A red haze was forming before her eyes and for the first time in days she felt the customary feeling she always felt when she reached for her mallet. "YOU! SHAMPOO NO BAKA!"</p><p><b></b>Cologne watched with interest and let the situation progress. As suspected, her great-granddaughter was boiling mad too. Her bonborries already drawn she assumed a defensive stance. But as soon as the mallet appeared in Akane's hands Soun Tendo stood up, much to the surprise of many. "Daughter, you will not harm any of our guests. Put that mallet away and let Elder Cologne finish her explanation. NOW!"</p><p><b></b>Akane was so surprised at being called back by her father that her mallet winked out of existence and Cologne nodded once more to herself. That had been most enlightening. "Thank you, Tendo Soun. Now if we all could put away our assorted weaponry," she said with a glace at her great-granddaughter, who obliged and stored her bonborries in her stuff-space, "I could finish my explanation." she said from her spot on her cushion.</p><p><b></b>All present nodded while Akane sat down too, although somewhat reluctant and still steaming. Nodoka had taken precautions and served her a calming tea. Cologne noticed this, and nodded into the other woman's direction. "This is good, Saotome Nodoka, but not strong enough. And no, it has nothing to do with any kind of poisoning. As I said before I was interrupted, I suspected that Shampoo had poisoned Tendo Akane. But she could prove that she had not. Here," she said, and produced the items she had confiscated, "this are the items I had been missing. Tendo Soun, I know that you are sensitive to ki. What do you see and sense?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Curious the Tendo patriarch got up from his cushion and examined the items in question. Even Genma who had pretended to ignore the on goings up till now came to the table and took a look too. After all he was not a master of ki-detection and manipulation for nothing.</p><p><b></b>And after the explanation the two masters looked at each other and saw in each others eyes that the other had found out the same. "These have not been used." they said in unison.</p><p><b></b>"How can you be sure, dad?" Nabiki asked. "It could have been exchanged. Who says that little sis was not poisoned through the usage of other equipment?" she questioned further and Akane nodded empathically.</p><p><b></b>"Yeah, the bimbo could have used other equipment, couldn't she?" she asked glowering, silently thankful for her sisters' support.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka used this opportunity to put a cup of tea in front of her and whispered a few words in her ear. Surprisingly Akane nodded some moments later, sat down and began sipping her tea. A satisfied Nodoka nodded to herself and sat down too.</p><p><b></b>Cologne looked into the round. "This is a valid question, Tendo Nabiki, and one I expected from someone of your caliber." she said with a cackle. "But I swear on my honour as an Amazon Elder that none of the other equipment which could have been used was used. You," she pointed at Genma and Soun, "noticed yourself that the more dangerous stuff is equipped with a ki-marker so that its use can be traced. I checked my whole equipment and none of it was used. If you want, to Tendo Soun, you can check my whole equipment with Saotome Nodoka as witness. This I swear on my honour. Tendo Akane was not poisoned, at least not by my great-granddaughter." she said cryptically.</p><p><b></b>"Not by your great-granddaughter?" Nodoka asked and beat the others to the punch. "But you mean that someone did? Who?" she continued her questioning, and everyone looked at Elder Cologne.</p><p><b></b>Said Elder smiled sadly. "I am afraid that Tendo Akane poisoned herself." she said and dropped the bombshell.</p><p><b></b>"WHAT!" Akane exclaimed unsurprisingly. "Why would I be so stupid as to poison myself? I would never be so dishonourable as to frame someone even if it is someone like the bimbo. One sec… has someone given me some poison without my knowledge? In ramen for example?" she asked voicing not only her suspicion.</p><p><b></b>But again Elder Cologne shook her head. "No, Tendo Akane, no outside influence was involved. And I witnessed the reason for your uncontrollable anger and your volatile temper myself just minutes ago. It is your mallet, Tendo Akane."</p><p><b></b>"What do you mean by that?" asked Nabiki for her stunned little sister and everyone except Akane, who was muttering something to the effect of "My trusty mallet? How?" watched with curiosity.</p><p><b></b>Elder Cologne however waited until she also had the full attention of Akane. Only then she began to explain. "Your mallet, Tendo Akane, is a ki-attack." she said and dropped yet another bombshell.</p><p><b></b>Silence. Then... "WHAT! I can do ki-attacks?"</p><p><b></b>The matriarch of the Joketsozuku nodded again. "Your mallet is an uncontrolled ki-attack. And a very problematic one."</p><p><b></b>"Why is that, Elder? Wouldn't it make the situation less problematic if she learned how to do it voluntarily?" Nodoka asked and Akane's concentration switched from Nodoka to Cologne.</p><p><b></b>Said Elder shook her head. "No it wouldn't. As said the mallet is a ki-attack and this in and on itself is not bad. But that it is emotion-based and based on anger no less is a <i>big</i> problem."</p><p><b></b>"And why is that?" Akane asked somewhat miffed. She did not like where this was going.</p><p><b></b>The Elder sighed. "Akane, I am an Elder for more than 200 years now and I know everything about ki there is. Your mallet is a ki-attack based on anger. And if you base your ki-attacks on emotions, say anger or confidence, then you will over time come into a state where you can feel nothing else. Even when you're normal´. And that has already begun in your case Tendo Akane. The more often you use the mallet the angrier you will become until you will begin to mallet even normal, innocent people. What happened in the past are good examples."</p><p><b></b>As well Akane as the rest of the attendees and that included even Shampoo and Mousse, were flabbergasted, but the middle sister of the Tendos regained her wits fast. "So you mean to say that if little sis here continued to use that mallet of hers she'd eventually end up killing someone?"</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded sadly, while Akane tried to grasp the concept. "M... my mallet makes me so angry? N... no, I can't believe it. My trusty pervert-basher?" she asked disbelieving.</p><p><b></b>The matriarch nodded once more. "It is true, Tendo Akane. I just realised some minutes ago that your mallet might be a ki-attack. And your attempted attack on my great-granddaughter gave me the proof I needed. I will also have to warn Ranma as s/he uses a ki-blast based on confidence. For what happens if you'd constantly use confidence-based blasts?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki wanted to answer but Akane had arrived at a conclusion too. And for once she had not jumped to conclusions but used her rather high intelligence. "If what you say is true then you would get so confident over time that your confidence would then turn into over-confidence. And a martial artist who is over-confident might act cocky and get him- or herself killed." she said with a great deal of thoughtfulness.</p><p><b></b>The Elder smiled. "Excellent, Tendo Akane." she said in genuine praise which caused Akane to smile satisfied. "And what I said <i>is</i> true. Your anger-based mallet-attack makes it important to begin with some meditation techniques as soon as possible. If you'll allow, Tendo Soun, we'll start working on it tomorrow. This can not be allowed to go on else Tendo Akane might destroy the life of not just herself." she said gravely.</p><p><b></b>Soun Tendo gulped as he realised the gravity of the situation and proving that he was indeed regaining his backbone and spirit he did not break out into a torrent of tears, but made a decision. "I allow it, Elder Cologne. And thank you for your help."</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded. "But you, great-granddaughter will be punished anyway. You stole a highly dangerous poison, a blowtube and a very sophisticated bio-synthetical arrow. And you had at least planned to use it and you know what that means."</p><p><b></b>Shampoo hung her head. "Yes, hibachan. That Shampoo steal against orders of Elder is bad. Attempt also as bad as real thing. Shampoo realise that. But why you call airen Ranma and not 'son-in-law'? Makes no sense to Shampoo. You is always calling airen son-in-law!"</p><p><b></b>The matriarch sighed. "Better sit down again, great-granddaughter. This will really knock you off your feet as they say here."</p><p><b></b>Then the Elder began to explain what had happened and what the tribe had decided. Shampoo was growing increasingly paler throughout the one-sided conversation and even Akane, who had been her rival, looked pitying at the girl. And Akane began to realise that Shampoo had really loved Ranma as much as she had. But like her love it had been in vain and like Shampoo, she had destroyed this love through her own actions and words.</p><p><b></b>Now Akane realised that she did not have the luxury of an excuse for her own faults but that her mallet had caused all this. And if she thought logically about it, in the end she really had <i>needed</i> to mallet Ranma to work off her anger. It was the same thing as it had been for Ryoga. She knew of the effects of the Shi Shi Hokodan and that it temporarily relieved Ryoga of his depression but she had never made the connection to her anger and that it was the same for her.</p><p><b></b>But looking at Shampoo she saw that she was at least as miserable as she had been and in contrast to Shampoo she had had some time to accept the reality. She had lost any chance at Ranma and so had Shampoo. Despite the fact that they had been rivals her heart went out to the other girl and she got up and went over to the Amazon girl.</p><p><b></b>It was visible that Shampoo was fighting tears when Cologne had finished her explanation and the effects the contract with Ranma had and Akane softly laid her hands on Shampoos shoulders. Surprisingly the Amazon girl did no resist. Instead she muttered "I is Amazon warrior… I not cry…" like a mantra.</p><p><b></b>But finally the dam broke and not even Cologne chided her great-granddaughter for showing weakness. She, Cologne, had made many mistakes in her life and it would be a grave mistake to forbid her great-granddaughter to cry over her loss.</p><p><b></b>Xian-Pu had loved Ranma, that Cologne had known ever since the Ghost-Cat incident. Thus, instead of chiding Xian-Pu for crying in front of outsiders she added her tiny arms to the embrace in an effort to comfort her crying great-granddaughter.</p><p><b></b>The Elder was surprised and impressed that Akane had made the effort to comfort her former rival but it showed that the Tendo girl had a good heart and character , worthy of her help. The girl had just been misguided by her anger and thus had lost any chance with Ranma too. Yes, there were other fish in the sea, but Ranma was special and thus it was really no surprise that the girls cried over their loss. They had lost and to someone they'd have never expected.</p><p><b></b>But before her great-granddaughter could form any coherent thought of resistance against the decision of the council and by proxy against her, she made a suggestion. ° <i>Xian-Pu, my great-granddaughter, my own flesh and blood, the loss of your Airen is tragic, but it had to happen for the greater good of the tribe. Had we forced him/her into our tribe, s/he would have brought it down. You saw what s/he did to Saffron and now Ranma is even stronger than the god. S/he would not have been happy in our tribe, and that we made him/her our ally was the only solution acceptable. I know how much it hurts you, I know how much you loved Ranma and still do, but s/he loves someone else. You must accept this, my Xian-Pu, or you will never lead a happy and fulfilled life. If you don't let go, not even Aphrodite can help you, and I don't want that.</i>° she said with emotion thick in her voice.</p><p><b></b>This fact alone made Xian-Pu look up for she had never heard her great-grandmother speak this way to her. In her youth she had raised her emotionlessly to be the village champion, a beautiful fighting machine which was called to duty in fights.</p><p><b></b>That had not changed much after the incident with Ranma-onna but she had to admit to herself that their relationship had slowly changed in the duration of their stay in Japan. And now she had proof that her great-grandmother did care for her. °<i>But what about the outsider rules, great-grandmother? Won't I be killed or locked forever now that I failed?</i>° she asked in a sad voice.</p><p><b></b>Now Kuh Lon actually smiled and stroked her hair. °<i>No, child, you won't. I had the kisses dissolved, and you know what? The whole Kisses will be cancelled out of our rule-books forever. I finally succeeded, and those kisses will never harm anyone ever again. Especially what happened to you, my child, made it clear to me that no one should ever have to suffer so much like you and Ranma. You are free, child, and so is Ranma.</i>°</p><p><b></b>Mousse, who had been sitting on his cushion in silence grinned at this and smirked at Xian-Pu. In truth he smirked at Nodoka as the duck-boy was once more to vain to wear his glasses. A hard bop to the head later the Amazon boy finally applied his glasses and what he saw was not to his liking. "If you think that you have now a shot at my great-granddaughter, boy, then think again. It is now up to her who she chooses as the old rules for marriage challenges will also soon be history. Only if both Amazons agree to the challenge and only then, a challenge will take place. And I highly doubt that my great-granddaughter will accept a challenge for her hand from you."</p><p><b></b>Shampoo nodded empathically. "I never accept challenge from stupid duck-boy. I no love you, stupid Mousse!"</p><p><b></b>Cologne looked at the myopic boy. "You heard it, Mr. part-time. I suggest that you get your vision fixed and find someone else. My great-granddaughter is not interested in you."</p><p><b></b>Mousse looked disbelieving. "B… but my Shampoo… I love you! And I know that you love me too! Who makes you say those things?"</p><p><b></b>The Elder bopped him on the head again. "Boy, how do you think does my great-granddaughter <i>really</i> feel about you? You think she loves you? Would you love anyone who pesters you constantly and who obsesses about you? This is no love, boy, it is what the Japanese call stalking. And I as your Elder have tolerated this behaviour long enough. Wouldn't it have been for your great-grandmother I would have intervened long ago. But I admit that I thought your behaviour towards my great-granddaughter would serve to make Ranma jealous and would urge him to finally confess his feelings for Shampoo but as this is over and done with there is no base for your obsessions any more. So it is my will that they immediately be stopped."</p><p><b></b>Akane stepped over to dumbfounded Mousse. "Mousse, we know each other a long time, ever since you kidnapped me. Have I ever lied to you?" she asked and looked him into the eyes.</p><p><b></b>The Amazon youth returned the look, then he bowed his head. "No, Tendo Akane, you have not. What is it that you want to tell me?" he asked dejectedly.</p><p><b></b>The youngest Tendo girl smiled somewhat. "You surely have heard about these stupid morning fights I had to endure until Ranma arrived, right?" she asked. At his nod she continued. "Those boys were obsessed with me and did pester me constantly. They declared their love for me and claimed they were doing all of it out of love. Even attacking me and others. Do you have any idea how much I hated it? And you did the same to Shampoo even if unwittingly. Mousse, Shampoo does not love you and you can not force her to love you nor <i>should</i> you. But this it not the end of the world. There are many more girls out in the world who consider you a very handsome guy. So please let go of this obsession before it hurts anyone more than it already has. Most of all you."</p><p><b></b>Mousse thought long moments about her words, and finally, with a haunted look, he looked at Shampoo. °<i>Please tell me honestly, Xian-Pu… do you love me? Have you <b>ever</b> loved me?</i>°</p><p><b></b>Shampoo returned his look with something akin pity. °<i>No, Mu Tzu, I have not. In our childhood we were best friends despite your handicap, and because of my upbringing I did not care. I had so few friends that I cherished the few I had. And when you obsessed over me it killed me inside. I could not return your love because I held none for you, not the way you wanted me to love you. Mu Tzu, I have never loved you nor will I ever. But I hope we can be friends, like in old times…</i>°</p><p><b></b>This emotionally brutal response was what the doctor had prescribed for Mousse finally saw it clearly. He really <i>had</i> obsessed over Shampoo and <i>had</i> stalked her. He had become what he had never wanted to become, someone his tribe called an annoying male. And it had taken an outsider woman to make him realise that. How could he have been so blind? Hadn't she said more often than he could count that she did not love him?</p><p><b></b>Damn, how much time he had wasted on an unrequited love. And he had hurt someone who had been his friend in the process, a friend who had never wanted to be anything else. And sadly for him this was not one of those cheesy soap operas where love could grow from friendship. For that to happen he had screwed up too thoroughly. That she had said 'I hope we can be friends' had been the death sentence for his love.</p><p><b></b>Even <i>he</i> knew from TV shows that this sentence when uttered by a female meant the ultimate end for a relationship. Robbed off of his delusions he felt himself nodding towards the waiting Shampoo. °<i>Yes, Xian-Pu, I would like that. Friends. But now please excuse me… I have to think about some things.</i>°</p><p><b></b>Then the myopic boy bowed towards the present attendees. "If you would excuse me, I have to go. And my heartfelt thanks to you, Tendo Akane. You opened my eyes." he said with a deeper bow towards her.</p><p><b></b>Akane smiled at him. "I'm glad I could help you, Mousse. I hope you'll find what you're searching for."</p><p><b></b>Mousse looked back with a small smile. "That I hope too…" he said and walked out of the door.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki had looked interestedly at the byplay between Mousse and Akane and she wondered if that had only been the customary friendliness of Akane towards people who needed help or if it had been more. Hmm, it seemed as if she'd have to keep an eye on a certain duck-boy…</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded to herself from her place at the table. "I am glad that this has finally been cleared up. Now to other matters, great-granddaughter. Ranma is not completely out of your life if you should wish so, Shampoo." she said to the surprise of everyone present.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka looked irritated. "What do you mean, Elder? I thought we had established that any claim on Ranma from your side is invalid."</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded. "And that is the case, Saotome-san. What I have to propose or should I better say suggest in face of how this word has been misused in the past," she said with a look at Genma, who began to sweat, "is, that you, my Shampoo, become the shield sister of Ranma. She is an accepted ally of the tribe thus it would be possible. But think about it, great-granddaughter, and take your time with the decision." she said towards a surprised Shampoo.</p><p><b></b>Everyone was, of course, curious. "What does it mean, Elder? No claim on my child, okay, but what <i>is</i> a shield sister?" Nodoka asked.</p><p><b></b>Cologne smiled in response. "I will explain it if my great-granddaughter should decide to act on my suggestion. But I can assure you that it would only have advantages for your child; that I promise. Now you have to excuse us we had a very hard day, my great-granddaughter especially."</p><p><b></b>Shampoo nodded thankfully at her great-grandmother, then she looked into the round. "This one sorry that she caused you anger and grief. Only did what she did because she love Ranma. Hope you forgive." she said honestly.</p><p><b></b>The Tendos and Saotomes did not think for long. Nodoka nodded with a small smile, after all, she understood that her gentle child attracted a lot of attention and the Tendos nodded too. Everyone understood Shampoo and Akane even hugged Shampoo. "I understand, Shampoo. You did what you did to win Ranma but in the end none of us won. Who knows maybe we can become friends now…"</p><p><b></b>The Amazon girl seemed to really consider this. "Maybe vio… Akane is right. Past is past but present and future is important." she said with a bow and waved good bye.</p><p><b></b>With that the Amazons departed and they had to admit, Shampoo had taken that a lot better than they would have thought. Nabiki had been worried that the Amazon girl might go on a homicidal rampage when she heard of Kasumi and that she was going on the trip with Ranma and it had been clear that the girl had put two and two together. But this danger seemed to have passed, luckily…</p><p><b></b>Now she, and probably Nodoka too, wished for a way to communicate with Kasumi and Ranma to bring them up to date. But as of now no possibility existed…</p><p><b>Present day, Okayama prefecture</b></p><p><b></b>Six days after they had left the Gifu prefecture a petite, buxom and very beautiful red-headed girl who was wearing a huge backpack arrived in Okayama, accompanied by a tall, handsome brown-haired man.</p><p><b></b>Obviously the local kids where still on break in this district, for a lot of boys were hanging out in the arcades that seamed the main-street. And all of them wolf-whistled when they laid eyes on Ranma. Some even drooled and Ranma could count herself lucky that she was wearing one of the undershirts they had bought, now that they had reached Okayama. Kasumi had deemed this precaution as necessary for when they were inside the town.</p><p><b></b>Else Ranma would give anyone a free show of her impressive bust-line. And that was something Kasumi did not want. Thus Ranma who was still developing feminine modesty had given in when Kasumi-otoko had asked the simple question if Ranma would like it if Kasumi-onna would give the public a free show of her assets. A bra was for now out of the question as Ranma planned to appear at the Masaki's in male form.</p><p><b></b>That she was wearing an undershirt now prevented that more than staring or drooling occurred on the boys´ side. Well, talk about hormonal driven teenagers. Ranma sighed. It was the same thing everywhere. She was however secretly pleased at Kasumi-otokos' reaction. Said cursed Tendo seemed to growl and took her small hand into his rather large one as if to say 'Mine!'</p><p><b></b>That he laid his other arm around her waist in a very possessive way made Ranma smile and feel oddly protected. Apparently the male hormones of her boyfriends' body were working overtime as per Kasumi's explanation of what happened when two people fell in love. Not that she minded. At the moment hers were adjusting too so strange feelings were to be expected. And the good thing was most of them were good feelings.</p><p><b></b>It really seemed that by staying in the alternate form and not changing back immediately one slowly got used to the different brain and hormonal levels. The downpours that occurred unerringly and seemingly just for them had often hindered Ranma to change back, and after some time s/he had gotten used to it.</p><p><b></b>Especially after Kasumi's period had been over and she had 'joined the fun' once more. Ranma would not have admitted it just yet, but maybe her mother had been right and she really <i>was</i> both sides of a coin. But at the moment this thought was deeply hidden inside of Ranma's mind.</p><p><b></b>For the moment she shrugged inwardly and leant a bit closer into her 'boyfriend'. Predictably most of the boys looked downcast at seeing this display of affection between the two, especially when they saw the apparently loving look the beautiful redhead was giving the tall man.</p><p><b></b>But a few were obviously incorrigible and sought to try it anyway. One especially handsome young man came towards Ranma, apparently ignoring Kasumi-otoko. Which was no easy feet, as Kasumi-otoko was easily towering several inches over the boy. "Hey beautiful," he said towards Ranma, "where have you been all my life?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked at the idiot before her like one would eye a cockroach. Only not as friendly. "Let me think…" she said and pretended to do just that, "I've been on a ten year martial arts training journey with my father, learning how to beat the snot out of just about anyone, then, for the last year I have been in the Nerima ward, and..."</p><p><b></b>That was as far as she got. The boy had suddenly blanched. "<i>Nerima</i>! So sorry for having disturbed you, Miss." he half stammered and literally <i>ran</i> back into the Arcade where his friends were waiting.</p><p><b></b>Ranma just shrugged prettily and continued her way with Kasumi-otoko inwardly grinning that she had not been forced to reinforce her declinature of his advances.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile the boy by the name of Hotaka had returned to his waiting friends. Friends who were really surprised when they had seen their leader apparently stumble over his own words. Something that had <i>never</i> happened before.</p><p><b></b>Hotaka sat down heavily on a bar stool. Finally he looked at his friends. "Pals, believe me when I say that we don't want <i>anything</i> from this girl. Do you know where she's from?" he asked into the round.</p><p><b></b>Shaking heads. How should they know?</p><p><b></b>Hotaka gave the dreadful answer. "Nerima! She is from <i>Nerima</i>! And doesn't she look like someone we have seen before? Think of the redhead in the news!"</p><p><b></b>Gulps ensued and the boys looked at each other and then nodded gravely. Yup, they all had heard of what was every day life in Nerima. Utter craziness! Reports about Nerimas' local martial artists and this strange flying monster had even been on the news sometimes. And Hotaka even had a distant cousin who went to school there at Furinkan High and he had related all of the stories. The horror!</p><p><b></b>If this girl was of any relation to this one guy named Ranma Saotome, the big bad-ass martial artist who was rumoured to kill demons before breakfast as a warm-up and do other equally incredible stuff, they did not want to touch her with a ten foot wide pole.</p><p><b></b>Gauging from how attractive the girl was it was a distinct possibility that she was one of his girlfriends, for it was a known fact that Ranma Saotome attracted beautiful girls like the Pied Piper of Hamelin rats. Apparently Ranma Saotome didn't even need a pipe, the lucky bastard. The poor sod over there would surely suffer big time once Ranma Saotome found out that some guy had stolen his girlfriend.</p><p><b></b>"Damn," one of the boys, Kenta, exclaimed, "you're right Hotaka! She <i>is</i> the redhead from the news from Nerima! She's the one who fought with all those other girls!"</p><p><b></b>The others nodded, now remembering it too and making the connection to the beautiful redhead their leader had tried to entrance. That made it definite. She <i>was</i> one of Ranma Saotomes' girls.</p><p><b></b>No, this girl, as beautiful as she was, was a big no. Sighing dejectedly the boys continued to watch out for other hot babes.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma, the girl who was thought to be her male sides' girlfriend, was trying to remember where Tenchi lived. She still hoped that she did not have to cross the bridge and tell Kasumi-otoko that she did not knew exactly any more. She was sure that she had found the spot were the house <i>should</i> have been, but no house there.</p><p><b></b>And after some time it became obvious that she was not having any success at finding the house of her friend. Fact that Kasumi-otoko had noticed and voiced after another fruitless search. "Ranma, could it be that you don't <i>know</i> where Tenchi lives? Could it be that you don't remember?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked sheepish. "Sorry, Ka-kun. It is a really big house and should not be hard to find. But I can't seem to find it for some reason."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo softly cupped Ranmas' chin in his right hand. "And do you know what a girl does when she does not know the way?"</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist shrugged prettily. "No, Ka-kun. What?"</p><p><b></b>Now Kasumi-otoko smiled. "Use her feminine charm and <i>ask</i> for the way. And that is what you'll do now, love."</p><p><b></b>Ranma seemed to accept this particular truth. Then she started looking around, and a few seconds later her eyes lit up. "An ice-cream parlour! Mmh, maybe I can kill two birds with one stone..." she muttered dreamily.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko shook his head in mirth and followed his 'girlfriend', who was now about to enter the vendors shop. Suddenly Ranmas air practically radiated cute, and every boy in the ice-cream parlour noticed. Unsurprisingly lustful stares ensued.</p><p><b></b>Ranma ignored those and looked at the vendor. "Sorry, mister, could you please help me?"</p><p><b></b>The vendor looked up from what he was doing. What he saw was a <i>really</i> cute redhead who was looking at him with big, blue eyes. "Umm... how may I be of service, Miss..."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled.<br/>"Saotome. Ránmā Saotome."</p><p><b></b>A boy, who was sitting right next to them on a bar stool suddenly looked up. Sure, he had noticed the hot babe before and had silently hoped to hitch a date with her despite the fact that she was accompanied by a man. Who had a hand around her waist.</p><p><b></b>As if that would have been a hindrance once he would have overcome his shyness. But now he was shocked. And looked pale. Apparently he would get no chance to overcome his shyness. "Ránmā <i>Saotome</i>? Any relation to <i>the</i> Ranma Saotome?" he asked with dread.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nearly face-faulted. How did he know? "Umm... yes. He is my brother. But how do you know him?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko, who was standing beside Ranma was now curious too. Had Nabiki something to do with it? Had she set up a merchandise regarding the martial artists in Nerima or something? He had had the same suspicion in Oume already. Now that was something he would not put past his sister and her enterprising mind.</p><p><b></b>The boy had visibly relaxed. Now that he knew that he had not a snowballs chance in hell to get a date with the cute redhead he had overcome his shyness. "You know, there was this news report in which Ranma Saotome fought this other guy who could throw those green fireballs and stuff. In the end, your brother won. He is really cool! Tell him that when you see him next time, Miss, and ask him for an autograph!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked sheepish. "Will do." She then turned back to the vendor. "Mister, what I wanted to know is if you could tell us where Tenchi Masaki lives."</p><p><b></b>A minute later a very satisfied Ranma was leaving the ice-cream parlour with as much ice cream as she could carry, free of charge, of course, and the new address of Tenchi Masaki. It appeared that the house had been relocated to another place, a shrine, to be exact, which had been the obvious reason why she had not been able to find it.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had also learned a valuable lesson. If a woman did not know how to proceed further, she only had to act cute and ask. Kasumi had been right; it had worked like a charm!</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko had also learned something. Namely that he had a very manipulative 'girlfriend'. The ease with which she had talked the vendor into giving her as much ice cream as she wanted had been awe inspiring. He doubted that even his sister Nabiki would have been as successful.</p><p><b></b>Now that they had Tenchi's new address they could finally get to the Masaki house.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Slowly walking hand in hand Ranma and Kasumi-otoko walked towards the address, looking like any normal couple, which, in all essence, they were. If one overlooked the fact that both were cursed to change genders when splashed with water and that one of them was probably the best martial artist on the planet.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko looked at his girlfriend. "Love, what can you tell me about Tenchi and his family?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma seemed to think for a moment. "Well, first there is Tenchi. Like me, he is now 17. He is a really nice guy, a real pal, has brown eyes and black hair. You'll like him. Then there is his grandfather, a guy named Katsuhito. He is a Shinto priest, and when I was staying there with Pop he was starting to teach Tenchi the family Art. Oh, and then there is finally Tenchi's dad. He's a bit weird, and if I remember right he's something of a pervert. Always wants to peek at girls 'n stuff. But he ain't as bad as the old lech. Not by a long shot. Essentially, he's harmless."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded. "And you really think they have enough space for us to stay?"</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist smiled up at her boyfriend. "Well, his father the pervert is also an architect, and apparently a good one. And they have this very big house. What with only the three living there it shan't be no problem taking us in."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded while they were following the directions the vendor had given them. From what he had seen of Okayama they would like it here. It was different from Nerima, but in a good way. Instead of millions upon millions of Dojos this small, rural community nestled in the mountains had very few tall buildings and was spread out quite far into many directions. Here in the outskirts it was really quiet and peaceful. Ranma sighed. Maybe she and Kasumi-otoko would have a peaceful time here. Just maybe...</p><p><b>-.-</b></p><p><b></b>After some time of walking Ranma had lost her patience and had decided to take Kasumi-otoko up into her arms and run. Apparently the vendor had been right. They should have taken the bus, and they would probably have had to, had not one of them been a super-powered martial artist.</p><p><b></b>One fast run later they had reached the forest the vendor had described and were standing before a trail. According to the vendor this trail would lead up to the new location of the Masaki house, where also the Masaki Shrine was located.</p><p><b></b>"Ready to find out if we're welcome, Ranma-chan?" Kasumi-otoko asked and took his girlfriends' hand.</p><p><b></b>Said Ranma smiled. "With you at my side I can take on anything, Ka-kun. Come, let's go."</p><p><b></b>Inwardly beaming at the huge compliment Ranma had made him both cursed individuals proceeded up the trail. The walk through the forest was not particularly long, and the serenity of the place served to calm them down.</p><p><b></b>Even Ranma, who still did not have much appreciation for the beauty nature had to offer enjoyed the view of the cherry blossom trees that littered the path. Kasumi-otoko, who was still holding Ranmas hand, sighed contently. This was a very nice place, and he hoped that they would be welcome here. For he'd love to stay here.</p><p><b></b>A short while later they finally left the forest (even to Ranmas sorrow) and emerged into a small clearing. Across from it was a huge lake located, and in the background one could see the mountains. It was really a sight to behold, and one could else only see on a panorama card.</p><p><b></b>Before them the trail now split up into two possible directions. One possible path lead towards a large house that was located near the lake, and the other lead to a really long series of steps that ran up the side of a mountain. Ranma took this in. Apparently everything had been relocated the same way it had been before the house had been moved. Good. That made it a lot easier.</p><p><b></b>Nodding to herself Ranma looked at Kasumi-otoko. "Dunno where those steps lead, Ka-kun. But from what I'd guess probably to the shrine. When I stayed with pop at Tenchi's house before it was moved here his grandfather talked about his shrine in the mountains. Maybe it's there." she said and pointed up the steps. "That," she pointed at the house, "is, as you'll have guessed the house where Tenchi lives. And it is the same one he had in Okayama, that's why I know." she said with a smile."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko was impressed. "Wow, your friend Tenchi must really be rich that they could move the whole house. Reason for me to be envious, Ranma-chan?" he asked teasingly.</p><p><b></b>Ranma batted her lashes in answer. "Who knows?" she asked back equally teasingly.</p><p><b></b>Seconds later both fell over with laughter, and when they had recovered they shared a kiss.<br/>"I'd say it is time we change to our birthforms, Ranma-chan." Kasumi-otoko said.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded. Setting her backpack down she retrieved two thermoses with hot water. Foresighted as always Kasumi-otoko had suggested to get some hot water in the ice-cream parlour, and Ranma had seen the wisdom therein.</p><p><b></b>She gave one of the thermoses to Kasumi-otoko and used the cup to upend some warm water over her head. The change came instantly, and seconds later Ranma was a man again. "Odd." was the first thing he said, "It really does not feel so great any more to be a guy again. I mean, I still like being a guy better, but not by much." Then he shrugged. "Guess I'm really starting to get indifferent to the curse."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko who had meanwhile changed into Kasumi-onna nodded. "I know what you mean. I still like this form better too, for it is the body I have been born with, but my male body does not bother me any more, for he is me, too. Now come here, Ranma-kun." she purred.</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned. This was a Sirens call he answered all too gladly. Seconds later their lips locked in a passionate kiss, and boy did it feel good. One could literally feel the love Kasumi and Ranma exuded. This time however they broke the kiss and left it there instead of going further, for they had other priorities for the moment.</p><p><b></b>They kissed one more time, but in just this moment a downpour occurred. In the middle of the kiss both cursed individuals suddenly changed genders, and the sensations of the kiss suddenly changed. Not unpleasantly, rather the opposite. And it was an interesting feeling to change forms while kissing. Yes, they would have to experiment with that under a shower or something later...</p><p><b></b>A minute later they broke the kiss, and Ranma grumbled about stupid odd downpours while Kasumi-otoko laughed. "Guess we can forget to stay in our birthforms for now. It seems as if the rain wants us to remain this way for now. So, love, which way?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked at the house and then up at the pathway that apparently led to the shrine. "The house looks somewhat deserted right now, so I'd say lets try the shrine."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded, reset his backpack and started climbing the stairs. Ranma grinned. She had conditioned her boyfriend very well, apparently, for he seemed to see climbing the stairs as an exercise in endurance. Good! That was the Spirit of Anything Goes Martial Arts after all, to turn everything and anything into training. Smirking to herself Ranma bounded up the stairs easily despite her heavy backpack and fell into a springing step beside Kasumi-otoko.</p><p><b>-.-</b></p><p><b></b>Quite a while later they arrived at the ancient looking Masaki Shrine. Ranma had mused to herself that she could have climbed the 1000 stairs in under a minute, but Kasumi-otoko was just starting to get really into training, so allowances had to be made.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko and even Ranma looked around accretive once they had reached the top. This old Shrine had to be one of the most well kept Shrines they had ever seen, and both cursed individuals had seen quite a lot of Shrines, even if for different reasons. The cobbled pavement was immaculate, the grass was cut to a decent height, and even the trees were all perfectly pruned back. It was the decalcomania of the perfect Shrine.</p><p><b></b>Ranma however gasped when she suddenly read a huge aura in the area. It had been a long time since she had felt such a power-level, and her only comparison was the situation she had been in when Cologne had arrived from China. What soothed her worries however was the fact that the aura seemed to radiate peace and quiet and not even an inkling of malice.</p><p><b></b>The owner of the aura, however, seemed to be engaged in some kind of physical exercise or meditation, gauging from the ebb and flow of the ki-flows. Ranma decided to investigate and forgot all about changing forms, and Kasumi-otoko followed her closely. Following her lead to the owner of the aura Ranma soon entered something that looked like living quarters. They were sparse, and only consisted of a table, four chairs and some other furniture.</p><p><b></b>And there, in the middle of the room two men were seated in lotus positions. So the ebb and flow in the ki-flows had been caused by meditation! The older of the two men was Katsuhito. Ranma remembered him, for he had not changed much from when she had last seen him, over ten years ago. He was still a handsome looking old man with greying hair, dressed in the white robes of his chosen profession.</p><p><b></b>The other, younger man had to be Tenchi. While his eyes were closed and their colour could not be determined he had black hair and was bearing some similarity to the Tenchi Ranma had known. Currently he was wearing a fighting gi.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly the eyes of Katsuhito snapped open and he noticed the visitors. Sensing that Ranma and Kasumi-otoko did not mean ill and also noticing the really huge ki-reserves of the female, Katsuhito greeted them. "Hello, I am Katsuhito, the keeper of this Shrine. The young man beside me is my grandson Tenchi. How may I help you?" he asked, masking his surprise. This young woman really looked like... no that could not be! She had not had any more children. That he knew! But the resemblance... it was really uncanny! Could that be a coincidence?</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Tenchi had emerged from the meditative state too and was presently doing his best to keep in a major nosebleed. This redhead had to be one of the cutest females he had ever seen! Hopefully she was not here to claim him too; otherwise Ryoko and Ayeka would make meat loaf out of him! "Hello." he said and waved shyly.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled sheepishly. "Hi, Tenchi." she waved back, which increased Tenchi's blood pressure further. Luckily for him Ranma then looked at Katsuhito again. "I know this will be a bit hard to believe, but we have met before. I am Ranma Saotome. And this is Kasumi Tendo. Sorry 'bout this."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko had to smile at what Ranma had said. Those had been nearly the exact same words she had used when she had arrived the first time at the Tendo Dojo, over a year ago.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito however seemed to sift through his memories. "I am sorry Miss, but the only Ranma Saotome I know is male. And I met him last over ten years ago."</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed. "Ka-kun, if you would?" she asked and pointed at her backpack she was still wearing.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded and produced the thermoses. "Please watch closely now." Ranma said. "Ka-kun?"</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded once more and upended some warm water over Ranmas head, and the she changed into a he. Also Kasumi-otoko used the opportunity for a change of forms.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi was nearly blown out of his mind. "W... what? How?" he asked, at a loss of words at having seen a cute redheaded girl change into a tall, handsome and well built young man.</p><p><b></b>A man who bore a distinct resemblance to the Ranma Saotome he had come to know over ten years ago and who had become his best friend. That the man beside the former woman had likewise changed genders did not help the condition of Tenchi's poor mind much.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito whereas nodded. Ranma did not notice the hard glint that had appeared in his eyes when he had seen Ranma change. It had been too brief for anyone to notice. "Jusenkyo. Sorry for doubting your word, you really <i>are</i> Ranma Saotome. Your aura does not lie." he said.</p><p><b></b>Now Ranma and Kasumi-otoko boggled. "How do you know about Jusenkyo?" Ranma finally asked.</p><p><b></b>The Shrine Keeper smiled. "I am well read and have travelled a lot. Among my knowledge is the cognisance of the legend of an area covered in cursed pools, the Pools of Sorrow, also called Jusenkyo. Until this day I had no proof that these Springs existed, but apparently they are real."</p><p><b></b>While Tenchi still tried to grasp what was going on, Ranma nodded. "Believe me, they are all <i>too</i> real as we came to know. They are, or better were, located in the Quing Ha province of China near a village called Joketsuzoku, the home of a tribe of Chinese Amazons."</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito raised a questioning brow. "<i>Were</i> located, you said?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded sheepishly. "Yes. They were destroyed during a fight some months ago and all the pools mixed into one."</p><p><b></b>Finally Tenchi's brain had resumed its work once more. Maybe it had been the word 'fight' that had done the trick. "Ranma? Is that really you, Ranma? Were you <i>really</i> that cute redhead of a few minutes ago?" he asked and got up to give Ranma a good look over.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Yeah, Tenchi, it really is me. And the redhead was also me. Hey pal, long time no see." he said with a sheepish grin.</p><p><b></b>The next thing Ranma knew was that he was engulfed in a bone-crushing hug by Tenchi. "It is good to see you again, man! Even if you seem to be a woman sometimes now. How have you been?"</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist grimaced, and as well Tenchi as Katsuhito sensed instantly that his past was not something to be broached briefly. Katsuhito for his part wondered what exactly one Genma Saotome had done to Ranma. Should he find out that it was as bad as it looked, he would pay him a 'visit'. Promise to Nodoka or no promise. With an act of mental strength however he controlled himself once more and listened to what Ranma had to tell.</p><p><b></b>And Ranma began to tell his tale, while Kasumi hugged him from behind. The pigtailed martial artist laid his hands on hers, and a small smile crossed his features. "After I left here my life was anything but a walk in the park. I don't think we now have the time to list all the stupid things my pop did to me, so I give you the highlights for now." he started.</p><p><b></b>With that he proceeded to tell them a simplified version of his life on the road. The training, without the full details on the Neko-ken, just that it had taken place, Ukyo, the trip to China, and finally Jusenkyo. The highlights, so to speak. He'd go into the details later. Then he told them how he had found out about the engagement to the Tendos' and how he'd found out over time how often his idiot father had engaged him to some girl, and most often to fill his fat stomach.</p><p><b></b>At the multiple engagement part Tenchi visibly cringed. It seemed as if he and Ranma had a lot in common. Katsuhito on the other hand silently steamed at the utter stupidity and the gall of one Genma Saotome. If he did not have the iron control about his powers that he had, he would have exploded in power right now and would have hunted the idiot down.</p><p><b></b>But as he <i>had</i> enough self-control, the old Shinto Priest remained seated and listened to what Ranma had to say, his horror growing. How could he ever have made this promise to Nodoka? He should have skinned Genma Saotome alive when he had the chance, his promise be damned. Katsuhito could not believe how careless Genma had been; he knew that the man was not evil but his utter carelessness and single-mindedness had apparently very nearly destroyed a fine young person. It was incredible that Ranma had survived!</p><p><b></b>Said Ranma proceeded to tell about the daily situation in Nerima, the constant fights, the insults, everything, and how it all had climaxed: in Kasumi getting cursed and the dissolving of the engagement to Akane due to her actions. And that there were no cures for Jusenkyo curses. The cursed martial artist then said that they had decided with the help of his mother, Cologne and Nabiki, Kasumi's younger sister, that a training trip was called for to find themselves and to get used to their curses.</p><p><b></b>He also told Katsuhito and Tenchi how Kasumi they had discovered their feelings and how they both had already begun to come to terms with their curses. While Ranma had talked Katsuhito had grown progressively angrier, especially when Ranma had mentioned the Neko-ken. Only the mastery of his emotions he had learned in several centuries kept him from exploding outright at what Genma had done.</p><p><b></b>Nevertheless, he would have to sharpen the Tenchi-ken. From what Ranma had told them, Genma had been cursed to become a Panda. How fitting that a fat, lazy and utterly moronic man should become a fat and lazy animal. Yes, a Panda-fur rug sounded more and more appealing by the second.</p><p><b></b>Finally Ranma came to the reason of their visit. "Tenchi, you once said that I could come and stay at your place if I wanted. Does the offer still stand, and would it include Kasumi?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi smiled instantly. "Of course, pal. You and any of your friends, and especially your girlfriend are welcome any time!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled, as did Kasumi. "Thank you, Tenchi. You have no idea how much that means to us!" he said and gave his friend a hug.</p><p><b></b>"No prob, pal." Tenchi said.</p><p><b></b>After the two friends had released the hug Katsuhito had a question. The aura he was sensing from Ranma was not of Juraian origin, not as far as he could tell, and he'd need better equipment to tell for sure, but it was equally if not even more so powerful than his. In fact, Ranma probably ranged in the category of Kagato. "Ranma, I'd like to know how you became as strong as you are. As far as I can tell, I'd estimate that you are as strong as me, if not even stronger. How came this about?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi was once more nearly blown off his feet and had to sit down. Ranma was as strong or stronger than Gramps? Stronger than the man who had defeated Ryoko over 700 years ago?</p><p><b></b>Ranma grimaced once more. "This is related to the big fight that destroyed the Pools of Sorrow." he said with a grim expression. After what Kasumi had said to him about Jusendo, it was a bit easier to talk about it, but it was still hard.</p><p><b></b>Sensing Ranma's hesitance Tenchi relented. "Hey, it's no problem if you don't wanna tell. I understand. I, too, had fights I rarely want to talk about." he said in a tone that punctuated his statement and gave it credibility.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled an agonised smile. "Yes, ya sound like someone who has experienced similar things as me. Tenchi, I know ya as a good friend from my childhood days, and I still trust ya. Please sit down, ya two, for this ya'll better be seated."</p><p><b></b>And thus, after everyone (aside from Tenchi, who was already sitting) had sat down around the table, Katsuhito right to Tenchi and Ranma and Kasumi opposite of them and at the others side, and Ranma began to relate what had happened at Jusendo.</p><p><b></b>The call for help from the Jusenkyo guide. Their fight with the Phoenix people. How everything had climaxed in the big, decisive fight against Saffron, the immortal Phoenix King. How he had killed Saffron with a revised version of the Hiryu Shoten Ha. And how he had saved everyone, Akane included, at the price of another life.</p><p><b></b>Even if this price had been paid only temporary, as Saffron had regenerated and hatched again as a baby. Then Ranma explained how his powers had grown steadily after Jusendo, how his ki-reserves had deepened more and more and how he had become stronger and tougher in both forms.</p><p><b></b>Finally he revealed that Cologne, who he had introduced as the Head Matriarch of the Joketsozuku and something of a mentor, had postulated the theory that he had absorbed some if not all of Saffrons powers as the Phoenix god had died. And Ranma also revealed that he had barely begun to tap this new well of power inside of him.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's eyes had been fixed on either Tenchi or Kasumi, thus he did not notice the expression Katsuhito had on his face and in his eyes. It was pride.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
