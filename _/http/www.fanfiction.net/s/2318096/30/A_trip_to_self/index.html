No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b></b>I know it took me a while, and I apologise for the long wait. My inspiration had been very fleeting in regards of this story, and thus I concentrated on the stories my muse favoured. But now it has returned to this story, and I'm optimistic that it's here to stay.</p><p>Happy holidays to everyone.</p><p><b>Chapter 30: Reasons </b></p><p><b></b>To say that Soun was curious would have been an understatement. He had only recently learned that this Katsuhito was the old sensei of Nodoka but he'd had no idea that he'd made any promises to her. Intriguing. Gauging from Nodoka's facial expression she was not too happy with where the conversation was headed but he could also see the resolve in her to talk about it.</p><p><b></b>Soun could see how Nodoka steeled herself, and the Saotome matriarch nodded finally towards her daughter. "So my old master told you." she said. It was a statement and no question thus Ranma only nodded. "I feared that he would but that was well within his rights. He was entitled to should you ever meet him on your own. I figure he told you my complete background?" she asked her daughter.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "That he did. You know, mom, he's really proud of you. The only thing he did not like was…"</p><p><b></b>"Me marrying your father, dear. I know. He never approved of Genma and in hindsight in can see where he was coming from. But I loved your stupid father, and I still do." Nodoka said.</p><p><b></b>Soun who had no idea about any of this asked up. "Nodoka, I hope you don't mind but could you please enlighten me? Genma never said anything about your master and I only recently learned his name from you. When did you learn under him? And which style?"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka sighed. She never liked to talk about her past but Soun as a close friend deserved to know. After all, their families would be joined through marriage at one point in the future, and besides Soun had proven in the past weeks that he was trustworthy.</p><p><b></b>In the following minutes Nodoka launched herself into a complete recount of how she had met Katsuhito, her training and everything else. Not much later Nodoka explained the promises she had wrenched from her sensei. "When I met Genma Master Katsuhito did not approve of him in the slightest. Yet I fell in love with your father, Ranma, and my heart would not be swayed. However, my master tried to convince me many times to forget Genma and find someone better. Katsuhito was always like a father to me and looked out for me; I know he was concerned back then but I was convinced that I had found the man of my life. Your father was very strong and honourable back then," she said with gleaming eyes and Ranma asked herself if her pop had ever been what her mother described here, "before he underwent that dreadful training under his master."</p><p><b></b>At this Soun nodded sagely. "It was more than dreadful, Nodoka, oh so much more. Even till this day I shudder to remember the weeks and months of torture the master put us through. But your mother is right, my old friend Genma <i>was</i> once honourable. Sadly the master trained him too well and drove those traits out…" he sighed.</p><p><b></b>A gleam appeared in Nodoka's eyes. "That's also why I'm reeducating him. I gave him several months to change his behaviour yet he had failed to see the error of his ways; now <i>I</i> change his ways for him and show him that his masters' lessons are wrong. Honestly the views of women he has… but I'm getting off-topic." she said and took a sip from her tea.</p><p><b></b>Placing her cup onto the table Nodoka continued. "The first promise I wrenched from Master Katsuhito was that he'd never harm Genma unless he, Genma, should attack first. This was due to the fact that Genma behaved quite stupidly in front of my old sensei on more than one occasion. Fool that he is your father claimed that everyone fighting with a weapon is weak. Normally Master Katsuhito is an even-tempered man but as you well know, your father has a knack of making enemies out of people, and unsurprisingly he succeeded even with Katsuhito."</p><p><b></b>"No surprise there." Ranma snorted.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled. "Not really, dear. As a matter of fact, I barely kept him from slicing Genma to bits, and that on several occasions. Finally I managed to convince my old sensei that he was just misguided and did not intent any real disrespect; because sensei had a weak spot for me he gave me the promise not to harm Genma. That did however not include knocking him out should he get too annoying; and believe me that Katsuhito did just that on several occasions." she said with a sad smile as Nodoka seemed to remember these incidents.</p><p><b></b>Ranma hid a smile as she heard of her father's antics, but she was only partially successful. "Still the same old pops. I'm a bit glad that I obviously did not inherit too much from him, mom. And thanks to my love I've realised that a lot of pops teachings are utter rubbish. So if he's got something to teach me and it´s just plain stupid I'll just ignore him."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch smiled sadly. "It really seems to be the only practical course, daughter. Before he can teach anyone anything <i>he</i> has to be taught first. But I believe our lessons are slowly taking effect." she said with a wolfish grin.</p><p><b></b>Her daughter smiled. "I'd love to see that! And I really do hope that pops will come to realise that women are not inferior. I have." she said sincerely. "Is he as hard to convince as I think he is?"</p><p><b></b>Her mother smiled while she fingered her ever present katana; the sharp sword was resting in a scabbard and was leant against the sofa. "You can say that, daughter. Sadly your father is not so easy to convince as I'd like and some of the lessons of his master seem to be deeply ingrained. For example, he still sprouts his phrases that women are weak and stupid and how they should just do the cooking and give birth to children and be done with it. Thus you can imagine, that husband must be made to see the error of his ways. It's just for his best."</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned wolfishly, mirroring the expression her mother had earlier. "Oh yeah, pops needs that and loads of reminders. He's got a thick skull. Especially when he's a panda and pretends to understand nothing. But a good bop to the head or a trip into the pond usually help. Phew, to say that girls are weak, stupid and useless… I'm one at the moment and I'm anything but!" she exclaimed with conviction.</p><p><b></b>Soun who had not said a word for nearly two minutes watched silently and nodded to himself. Ranma had really proven herself worthy, and she had managed something Genma and he could only dream of; she had managed to defeat the master and Taro in one day! It would indeed be a proud day when he could call Ranma as well his son-in-law as his daughter-in-law. Now through the curse of his oldest child and what Elder Cologne had said he had finally accepted that these curses were for keeps. He'd also get a daughter-in-law out of a marriage, and he was sure that he'd not be able to get a finer one. Regardless what Genma would say, Ranma had his full support.</p><p><b></b>With a smile the Tendo patriarch watched as Nodoka placed her cup of tea on the table in front of her, got up and walked over to her daughter where she sat down again. The Saotome matriarch looked her daughter in the eyes and smiled. "I know, daughter. I can't say how proud I am that you managed to defeat Master Happosai and this Taro person. You're so strong and honourable, and I could not have asked for a better child!" she exclaimed and pulled a surprised but pleased Ranma into a hug.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka ruffled her childs' hair. "Never forget that you're as much my daughter as my son and that I love you regardless of the form, my child. What your father says does not matter; he made too many mistakes with you, and has no say in your further upbringing except for martial arts. And even there he won't have a carte blanche, my daughter, seeing what he did to you with the Neko-ken." she finished and growled out the last words.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's smile had progressively turned sad as her mother had went on. She was very happy that her mother had finally accepted her completely, for it made it so much easier for her to accept herself, but what she'd said about pops saddened her despite the fact that it was true.</p><p><b></b>She strengthened the hug but was careful not to apply too much pressure lest to hurt her mother. "Thanks, mom. You've got no idea what that means to me." she said as her mother continued to stroke her hair. "And you're right with stupid pops. But please don't be too hard on him. Sometimes I believe that he only taught what <i>he</i> had been taught by his own father. That showing emotions is weak. Sure, the Neko-ken was the most stupid idea pops ever had, but I love the old fool. I see the need that he never teaches me or my future children anything dangerous ever again, but it can't hurt if he teaches those moves that are harmless. With our supervision, of course."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka stopped stroking her hair and leant backwards to look her daughter into the eye. "You mean that, daughter, don't you?" she asked while trying to hide her glee at the mentioning of future children. So her daughter had already thought about it! Great! Nodoka barely stopped herself from doing a victory dance. Grandchildren! Gathering her bearings so as not to look suspicious she concentrated on Ranma's answer.</p><p><b></b>And her daughter nodded, completely oblivious to what was going on in her mothers´ mind. "Yes. If pops loves one thing than it's to teach. Usually he's quite good at it, but on our training trip he got, err, carried away a few times. If he should ever teach children he'd need supervision, but I think you'd be happy to provide it, won't you, mom?" she asked with a smile.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch nodded slowly. "I'm the wife of a martial artist after all, and considering what he did in the past he'll need a lot of supervision if he ever wants to teach children. Soun, what do you say to the idea that I'll supervise the future training in the dojo? I'm not sure Genma can stop himself from doing a few stupid things. Husband just has a knack for that."</p><p><b></b>Soun nodded. "It's a good idea, Nodoka. From what I've seen in the past months you manage to, err, correct his behaviour quite admirerably. Yes, your presence in the training hall would be a great help." he concluded.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled in answer. "Thank you, Soun. You know how to compliment a lady."</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch sputtered and Ranma shook her head at her mothers antics. "Moooom! Stop embarrassing poor Mr. Tendo! Rather tell him what the second promise was."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka sighed. "Right, dear." she said and made herself comfortable beside her daughter after she'd retrieved her cup of tea. "The second promise I managed to wrench from my sensei was that he'd not teach his family art to my child should Ranma ever meet him; he'd also never try to exert any influence on my child's life per this promise. However, he managed to convince me that the final decision of this should be up to you, my child. Thus we included a clause, that should you ever meet him and ask him yourself he could do so if he so decided."</p><p><b></b>Soun who had gathered his bearings looked oddly at Nodoka. "But why, Nodoka? It is the goal of a martial artist to learn as many techniques as possible, in order to be able to help the weak. What was your reason for this?" he asked curiously without even a hint of accusation.</p><p><b></b>Ranma, who already knew the reasons leant back and listened to someone else beside her. She heard her mother sigh. "Soun, you as a father know that parents tend to look out for the best for their children. I admit that I failed many times at that. Yet with this decision I believed that I could spare my child from having to make a decision of life or death. The family style of Master Katsuhito is an Art of War, and there're few styles out there that are deadlier. My son at that time was already learning from his father in an Art of War, for if you're truthful to yourself the Anything Goes Style is nothing else but an Art of War." she said with a sigh and paused to sip from her coffee.</p><p><b></b>"If it had been for me, Ranma, you'd never have learned martial arts at all. Yet you were the only heir to the Saotome school, thus I could do nothing against it. But I had the choice regarding my masters' family style, and had you not decided to make this trip to your old friend Tenchi, you might have never known. Know that I only kept this from you, my child, because I never wanted that you'd have to kill someone. I love you, my child, and I hope you can forgive your mother."</p><p><b></b>Her daughter, who knew all of this already, smiled and rested her forehead against that of her mother before she pulled her into a tight embrace. "I know you only wanted the best for me, mom. But now I'm old enough to make my own decisions; yet I don't know if I want to learn master Katsuhito's family style, but I'm giving it some serious thought. I appreciate what you had in mind, mom, but due to that fight with that Android everything has changed." pain flashed over her face and she paused for a moment to gather her bearings.</p><p><b></b>"I know that I have to rethink a lot. I can't allow that something like that happens again, and if I have more techniques at my disposal the next time something like that happens, I might be able to protect everyone better. I have been forced to kill on two occasions already, and although I hated it beyond belief and it made my stomach turn I now know that I had no other choice but to do what I did. I had to save my loved ones. In hindsight I'd always do it the same way again. I'd always kill Saffron again to save Akane, and everyone else and I'd always destroy that Android to avenge my love, for I had no other choice." she said.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka held her daughter tight, and she noticed that tears were streaming down her face; yet Nodoka did nothing to hide them. She was not ashamed of them and when she pulled back and looked into her daughters' face she noticed that Ranma's eyes were glistening too. Now knowing everything about the upbringing her child had had she was glad that her daughter <i>could</i> express herself so much better now.</p><p><b></b>A month ago Ranma would have denied at the top of her lungs that she, the great martial artist, was crying. Her daughter had changed and was slowly becoming more; now if only her son would be able to express himself just as good… but that was a matter for another time.</p><p><b></b>Now all that counted was to help her daughter to unfold herself, to live life to the fullest. She should simply enjoy being a girl for a time, yet it seemed that the craziness that permeated her life was making that difficult, even here. "You have changed, my child." Nodoka said finally and she noticed that Ranma watched her with rapt attention. With a smile the Saotome matriarch added "And all for the better. I know how hard it must have been to kill this Saffron, but you did what you had to do. You would never take a life needlessly, my child and you have proven time and time again that you're a person of high moral standards, and the most honourable fighter I know. I'm proud of you, Ranma, and I'll support you in whatever you decide. As long as its honourable." she added with a slight smile.</p><p><b></b>With a smile on their faces mother and daughter hugged yet again. "Thanks, mom. That means a lot to me. Gah, look at me, the big bad martial artist all moved to tears like a girl." she said with a hint of self-irony.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka punched her arm in jest with her right hand while still holding Ranma close with her left arm. "But that's what you are, dear, and I'm happy to have you as my daughter. Before I always tried to push you to be manly because of that stupid contract and my views on how you had to be, yet I overlooked that I destroyed your happiness by forcing you to act manly despite your gender. A girl, and that is what you are in this body, should not be forced to act manly. I understand that it's probably hard for you, but from now on and ever you'll always be as much my daughter as my son. I love both sides of you, my child." she said and reestablished the hug which Ranma returned with a bright smile and equal strength.</p><p><b></b>Soun on his part sat on his sofa and smiled. He knew that this talk had evolved into a full-blown mother-daughter-talk and thus wisely kept out of it. Yet just listening to it taught him a lot. They had indeed handled Ranma completely wrong. Instead of listening to Genma and treating Ranma as a man despite the gender they should have tried to help Ranma to accept the curse, treating the Saotome youth according to the present gender.</p><p><b></b>They, and especially he had made a lot of mistakes in the past, and he vowed that he'd not repeat them in the future. He'd also treat Kasumi according to the gender she was in, that he vowed to himself. This epiphany also made him realise the trap that was the curse of his oldest child: it was so easy to give in to the temptation and treat Kasumi exclusively as his son. But that would mean neglecting the half of his child she had been for over twenty years.</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch nodded to himself in a determined way, and he was sure that Nodoka saw it from where she was sitting. Yet he did not care as he hang to his own thoughts; he'd try to help the children to find equilibrium, a balance between their two halves. It would be ideal if they'd be brought into the situation where they could just switch between male and female at the drop of some water without caring about it. And that thought made him realise the cleverness of Nodoka and Cologne; for this had to be what they had had in mind when they'd suggested the trip!</p><p><b></b>Yes, he could see why they had suggested this trip away from Nerima, and most of all them, the fathers. <i>He</i> himself had come to the realisation what was needed to make the children get used to their curses, and that they really had to live some months in these forms; but he doubted that Genma ever would. His old friend had been too fixated on drilling manliness into Ranma for a too long amount of time.</p><p><b></b>Soun did not know if Genma would really have had abided by the wording of the contract, but as far as he knew Genma had done everything to make Ranma the manliest man for almost eleven years! Trying to force Ranma to act manly had become a second nature to Genma and with him around the whole enterprise would have been doomed to fail. Now the Tendo patriarch could appreciate the intents behind it fully; only with their children coming completely to terms with their curses they'd be able to use the full potential given to them. Without that acceptance they'd always be only half of what they could be.</p><p><b></b>For example, Soun had seen a caring side at Ranma that he had never seen in her before. It was as if she was slowly evolving into something more the more she accepted the growing female side as a part of her. He had seen the deep love in the eyes of Nodoka's daughter for his child, and he was sure that this love was meant to be forever.</p><p><b></b>Which was yet another reason why Genma had to be kept in the dark. With his harpings about how showing emotions was weak he could easily destroy or at least endanger the progress their children had obviously made. This thought also brought another epiphany for Soun; in the past Genma and he had not cared about the feelings of their children, at that time Ranma and Akane. He had accepted Genma's views how showing emotions was weak, yet at the same time they had expected Ranma and Akane to get along.</p><p><b></b>But how should that have been possible if Ranma had been taught his whole life that showing emotions was weak? Considering that and his daughters more… unsightly character traits the relationship between Ranma and Akane had been doomed, nearly from the start.</p><p><b></b>This time they'd make it better. He'd leave it to Ranma and Kasumi aka Yoshiro to set the pace for their relationship; this decision had been reaffirmed today by what he had learned. By letting it develop naturally without any pressure or force they might get much better results in the future.</p><p><b></b>The results were already very promising and the great goal which was still vivid in the back of his head, the joining of the schools seemed attainable. Yet this goal paled in comparison to what the Tendo patriarch wished for the two: happiness.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka on her part was having very similar thoughts as she held her daughter. However, her plans for Genma were more focused than Soun's. She liked Ranma's idea of keeping her husband busy very much, but she'd also an additional plan to keep him busy. And if this scientist that was living here was indeed as good as her daughter claimed, she might even have the chance to fulfil a personal dream of hers. Yes, she'd have to set her plan into motion.</p><p><b></b>Smiling at how everything was turning out Nodoka wondered to herself how long it would take for her to be a grandmother. She had to admit to herself that she even had stopped caring about who would be the manly party in the relationship her child and the child of Soun shared. Ranma was her daughter as much as her son, and who knew, maybe she one time decided to give her love children? Or it might just happen the other way around. Who knew what the future held? And in all honesty, she'd stopped caring, for she was sure that she'd get grandchildren in the end one way or the other. Was waiting a bit longer such a bad thing, if it brought happiness for her child? No, of course not.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka marvelled inwardly at her own change in attitude, but she realised that it brought about a lot more options; and most of all it made her child a lot happier. And was that not what parents should strive for? To ensure their children a happy and safe life?</p><p><b></b>Ranma had missed out on that a lot, and it was high time that that changed. But one thing remained. "Daughter, please do never try and keep the stupid things your father did from me. I know you want to protect him because you love him. I do too, and why only Kami-sama knows, but what your father did to you in training was foolish and dangerous. The Neko-ken alone warranted a severe punishment, and I'm sure you know that the foolishness of your fathers' actions have to be undone. I don't want my daughter to go insane every time she sees a cat."</p><p><b></b>"Very true words, Nodoka." a voice said from a newly created door, and three heads whipped towards the source of said voice.</p><p><b></b>"Grandpa!" Ranma exclaimed, and Nodoka, who looked surprised for a moment stood up and bowed her head. "Sensei." she greeted Katsuhito formally.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito bowed back and subsequently did the polite thing, for he exchanged pleasantries with Soun as the guest of the house first; the Tendo patriarch knew that they'd have time to talk at a later point in time, because right now it was clear that the older man longed to talk with Nodoka.</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto Priest walked towards the Saotome matriarch under the watchful eyes of Soun and Ranma. His face was an expressionless mask, but his eyes held a glimmer that showed how much he cared for Nodoka. Once he had reached Ranma's mother he put his right hand under her chin and lifted her head up. "Hello, No-chan. There is no need to be ashamed, but now you see why I wanted to prevent that Genma courted you. I foresaw his foolish and unthinking acts, for I have seen many like him in my long life. Yet he did one thing right in his life," here he smiled at Ranma who smiled right back, "and that outweighs the unintentional bad things he has done in his life."</p><p><b></b>"Hey, pop is not so bad. Sure, he's an idiot, but he'd never intentionally harm anyone. He can be a really good sensei… if he does not get carried away." Ranma said from her place on the sofa.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled at her child, and she sat down beside her daughter while Katsuhito seated himself beside Soun. Ranma loved her father, and even though she did not know if Genma deserved this love, she <i>did</i> love the fool; the same was true for her. For some reason she loved the fool, but from now on she'd do her utmost to repair the damage her husband had done to their child; and she would set all hell in motion to prevent him from doing something stupid to their future grandchildren. She had already failed Ranma, but she swore here and now to herself and on her honour that Genma would not be allowed near their future grandchildren without supervision.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito on his part nodded thoughtful. "I agree with you that he would not harm anyone intentionally, aside from the thieving and stealing he engaged in. Yes, I know of his past; little Washu was most helpful in that regard. The thievings he committed were nearly all minor cases, peccadilloes one could say, except for one case, the Kuonjis. But I know how strong love can be, and it is good to see that you two still love him after everything Genma has done. I, personally, would have hunted him to the end of the world. And I will do that should he ever turn up here."</p><p><b></b>Soun gulped, but if one saw it that way Katsuhito was right; Genma <i>had</i> done many questionable things on his training journey, and if he was honest to himself, it was a small wonder, no, make that a big one, that Ranma had turned out as well as he/she had. "My old friend Genma rarely stopped to think before he acted; this has always been his greatest fault, and sadly this has not changed much. I don't want to justify what he did, but maybe you will understand why Genma did what he did."</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch took a sip from his coffee and sighed. "Since Ranma had been born Genma had been filled with the ambition to make his only son and heir into the best martial artist ever. You all know this. What you don't know is that Genma had planned this for Ranma and my heiress so that they would be worthy heirs to the complete Anything Goes style; we had just incarcerated the Master a few years ago and believed him dead. Genma and I both knew that we were not good enough to succeed the Master, and thus the plan was formed to unite the schools."</p><p><b></b>"The joining of the schools." Ranma muttered. "Bah! If you two hadn't been so hung up on that, and hadn't pressured me and Akane at each and every occasion things might have gone differently. Not that I mind the outcome one bit."</p><p><b></b>Soun sighed. "I know, Ranma, and I apologise. Be it as it is, Genma was to train Ranma here in his branch of the Anything Goes style and incorporate everything they encountered on their training journey, and I was to train my heiress in the Tendo style. After the training was complete our heirs should meet and make good on the promise to join the schools. But sadly my Kimiko had died two years after Ranma and Genma went on the trip, and you, Nodoka and Ranma, know what happened. I fell into a state of depression and was unable to teach Akane, my heiress. In the end everything we had planned fell apart, but maybe you can now understand why we did what we did. We both wanted worthy heirs, and these heirs should join the schools through marriage. Ideally you should have taught your future children the complete Anything Goes style, but that will now not come to pass."</p><p><b>'I'm not so sure on that part, but that's for me to know and for you to guess.'</b> Ranma thought mirthfully. Suddenly her eyes lit up as a thought hit her. "Mr. Tendo, do you still have the scrolls of the Tendo school?"</p><p><b></b>"Why yes, Ranma. Why do you ask?"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito and Nodoka smiled amusedly. Both knew were this was leading. The old Shinto priest because he had come to know Ranma as an individual with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and Nodoka, well, because she knew her child.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled. "Because I could learn those scrolls! I'll need these techniques anyway when I want to challenge Happosai for the title of grandmaster of the Anything Goes."</p><p><b></b>"Isn't that rather grandmistress now, granddaughter?" an amused Katsuhito teased.</p><p><b></b>"Oh you!" Ranma exclaimed, and bopped him playfully on the arm.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka had followed this exchange with interest and she vowed to have a long talk with her old master as soon as possible. It seemed as if he had done a lot for her child.</p><p><b></b>Soun on his part had needed a few moments to gather himself again; this joyous message had thrown him somewhat off-track. "You… you really want to challenge the master, Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded. "Yes. Once I have prepared myself sufficiently I <i>will</i> challenge him. But I have no illusions that it's gonna be as easy as last time. I caught the old lech by surprise, and he won't underestimate me again."</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch nodded. "You're right to be cautious. The master is a fearsome fighter. In order to be able to deal with everything he has up his sleeve you will indeed need to know every move of the Anything Goes of which Genma and I know. Ranma, I will give the Tendo scrolls to you, even the Tendo secret techniques. You have proven yourself worthy to learn them."</p><p><b></b>Ranma was surprised for a moment, then she bowed formally. "Thank you, Mr. Tendo. I will not disappoint you."</p><p><b></b>Soun nodded from his place across the redhead. "I know that, Ranma." he said with a smile. "I will get the scrolls first thing tomorrow. Knowing you, you won't need more than to take a look at the scrolls to learn those techniques."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl blushed. "Aww, I ain't that good, Mr. Tendo."</p><p><b></b>"Don't sell yourself short, Ranma. I've seen you learn techniques in a time I would have thought impossible. If anyone can learn the scrolls, then it's you." Soun said with confidence.</p><p><b></b>"Actually I'd like to interject something, seeing as I witnessed this remarkable process myself." said Katsuhito. The others looked at him, curious. "I saw it when you used your ability to fly to beat the Android. Something happened to your aura, and ever since then I have pondered what it was. I have a hunch, but I'd need to conduct a deep scan of your aura to be sure."</p><p><b></b>Ranma thought for a moment, then she nodded. If there was anything strange with her aura she wanted to know. "Do it, grandfather. Whenever you are ready, for this I gotta know!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled. "We can begin immediately. I have already begun with the mental exercises needed for the scan in anticipation of your answer." he said and got up. "It would be best if you could lay down on one of the couches. I need your body to be as relaxed as possible, granddaughter."</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded, and Soun and Nodoka moved to the other sofa to allow Ranma the space she needed. Once the redhead had laid down Katsuhito bended forwards and held both hands over Ranma's body. Soon they'd know if the old Shinto Priest had been right about his hunch…</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito had his eyes closed, and his brows furrowed in concentration. A pale-blue glow enveloped the old man, and during the scan which lasted several minutes a sheen of sweat formed on his forehead.</p><p><b></b>Finally Katsuhito opened his eyes again; Ranma opened her own eyes little later, curiosity immediately visible on her face. "What is it, grandfather? What did you find out?"</p><p><b></b>The old man sighed and sat down beside Ranma. "This is a lot more complex than I initially thought, granddaughter. Your aura shows several anomalies. For one, your father had actually <i>succeeded</i> in making you a man among man. Your ki was seriously misbalanced; there was an excess of yang in your ki that would have been suffice for two men. You always attracted a lot of female attention, did you not? That was because of this misbalance. Your overmasculinity was practically a Sirens call for the female half of the population."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded, quite obviously struggling to understand the consequences. "Oh. But what do you mean with 'was misbalanced'?"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito smiled. "Your ki has begun to balance itself out again. You must know, granddaughter, normally yin and yang are in a balance. But apparently Genma had succeeded in driving your yin so much out of you that your ki became misbalanced. Had you not become cursed the consequences might have been severe."</p><p><b></b>"How so?" asked Nodoka, beating her daughter to the punch.</p><p><b></b>"Several symptoms, No-chan. First, a person with an excess of yang is bound to act highly aggressive and often makes fast, unconcentrated movements; its probably only due to the curse and your... restraint that you haven´t snapped, Ranma. But the lack in concentration alone can be very costly for a martial artist. Add to it that the whole body runs practically in hyperdrive due to the misbalance, and this is also why you need to eat and drink so much more than even your growing powers would warrant. Have you ever had a cold?" he asked out of the blue.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was stumped for a moment. "Err, there was this one time when I had a high fever. But that was because of some stupid virus I had caught thanks to Happosai. And don't you dare appear, devil, or I'll trample you into the ground!" she exclaimed temperamentally.</p><p><b></b>The others sweatdropped. Katsuhito finally nodded to himself; then he took one of Ranma's hands into his own. "As I thought. Still hot, but better than before, I imagine."</p><p><b></b>Seeing the questioning looks he elaborated. "Ranma was suffering from a rather severe case of excess of Yang, e.g., when excess heat consumes body fluids it leads to dryness or even heat. This is an excess heat condition which is often accompanied by a fever that can turn very nasty. Very unhealthy and dangerous in the long run. But now yin and yang are balancing each other out again due to your acceptance of your dual nature, in fact you will probably reach equilibrium of both yin and yang in a few months."</p><p><b></b>"See, daughter, I was right when I said that it was Fate that you were cursed to become a girl. It might even have saved your life."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded, nonplussed. Her life had made a turn for the strange yet again, but by now she was so used to it that she took it in stride. "I see. But there's something else, isn't there?"</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito looked her in the eyes and nodded. "Yes. And this is not so easily dealt with. I have no idea where you acquired it, but you're suffering from the worst case of congeries induerens I have ever witnessed. I have no idea if it could be a side effect of your talent to learn new things at a moments notice, but the conclusion suggests itself."</p><p><b></b>"Wha… wha… what? What is that conwhatzit thingie?" asked a decidedly confused Ranma.</p><p><b></b>"It's a condition I do not wish upon my worst enemy, Ranma." little Washus' voice came from yet another door. The genius scientist walked over towards where Ranma and Katsuhito were sitting.</p><p><b></b>Nodding into the round the redheaded scientist sat down beside the younger redheaded girl. "Congeries induerens literally means chaos attraction. You, Ranma, are the living embodiment of the chaos theory; that is something I agree upon with Yosho. Everything becomes random around you, and the laws of probability cease to be of importance. I have no idea how anyone managed to do that to you, but if we ever find the culprit I'll sock him or her a good one. Its no wonder that everything went so completely wrong in your life."</p><p><b></b>"How do we remedy it?" a worried Nodoka asked immediately.</p><p><b></b>"There is only one way, and we'll need some time to prepare. The only thing I can promise is that we'll try our utmost to help you, Ranma." Washu said.</p><p><b></b>"Thank you, Washu-chan." Ranma said and hugged the other redhead.</p><p><b></b>"You're welcome, Ranma. Ahem, I have important things to do, preparations to make, and you, o Yosho, will assist me."</p><p><b></b>What Washu had said carried the meaning that Washu viewed Ranma as one of the family, and a knowing Shinto priest smiled. Sooner or later anyone fell for the subtle charm his new granddaughter exuded, else they were dead-set on killing her right from the start. But maybe they could change this too. And he knew exactly who could help. Tsunami.</p><p><b></b>The old warrior felt his stomach turn into knots however when what Washu had said caught up with him. He got up dejectedly , but moments later determination settled in. And if Washu turned him into something that could be squashed, he would ensure that Ranma got rid of the congeries induerens! "Coming, Lil' Washu. I bid you a good night, No-chan, Mr. Tendo, granddaughter."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka and Ranma were both sad that they had to leave already, especially Nodoka who would have loved to have a long talk with her sensei; but she mused that she'd have enough opportunities at a later date. Maybe tomorrow…</p><p><b></b>Soun on his part wished Katsuhito and Washu success in their preparations, and the old Shinto priest acknowledged this with a nod before he and Washu disappeared through one of the doors.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part had enjoyed the talk with Katsuhito, Soun and her mother seeing as she had learned a lot of things. What she had learned about her aura had been unsettling, but she hoped that Washu-chan and her grandfather would be able to help her. It was oddly comforting to know that she had not been responsible for the chaos that had permeated her life. To be honest, she could really do with a little less chaos in her life. Okay, make that lots less. And settling down with her love sounded nice.</p><p><b></b>Right now she was just enjoying being together with her mother; she would have enjoyed it even more had it not been for this queasy feeling that she'd had for some time now. It had begun yesterday, but during the fight with the Android and throughout the adjacent fights she'd been able to ignore it quite well.</p><p><b></b>Now it was back and seemingly with even greater force. Inwardly she asked herself if she was coming down with something, for she swore she could feel the beginning of cramps. She also felt more fatigued than she should have, even taking the fights into account. <b>'Bah, have probably just not eaten enough.'</b> she dismissed it.</p><p><b></b>Sensing that they'd poured out their hearts to each other Ranma decided that it was time to get settled in for the night. It had been a really long day and she was tired and very worn out. She looked at her mother. "Mom, I'm really wiped out and I'd like to call it a night. That okay with you two?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Soun and Nodoka looked at each other and back at Ranma as they nodded their heads. "To be honest, I'm quite tired myself, daughter. So go ahead. I'll join you soon." she said with a smile to which Soun nodded his consent.</p><p><b></b>Confident that Washu would hear her she exclaimed, "Washu-chan, I hate to interrupt you, but could you please join us for a moment?" she asked to the room.</p><p><b></b>Few seconds later a door appeared on the wall and the redheaded scientist stepped through. "You called?" she asked with a mock-curtsy.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled. "That I did, Washu-chan. Could you please make us a door to the upper floor? We're all quite tired and want to call it a night."</p><p><b></b>Little Washu nodded and pressed a button on her door-maker. Instantly yet another door appeared right beside the one little Washu had used to enter the r&amp;r-section of her lab. Soun and Nodoka were still unused to such feats and closed their open mouths with a click once they realised that they looked stupid. "Here you go. Was that all you needed?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma just smiled at their reactions, knowing that she must have looked the same when little Washu had done that to her the first time. Then she nodded to Washu. "Yes, Washu-chan. Thank you. Oh, one thing… could you rearrange my room, you know, make it doubly in size and place another four-poster in it? Mom will be joining me in my room." she said, a bit embarrassed.</p><p><b></b>The redheaded genius simply nodded. "Of course, Ranma. If that would be all, I have to attend to my preparations."</p><p><b></b>However her mother had other plans as to let little Washu return to whatever preparations she was making, as she remembered that she <i>had</i> something to ask. "Actually…" she said, standing up, "I have something to ask, Washu-chan. If you could spare the time, that is. Is there some place where we can talk in private?" she asked to the puzzlement of Soun and Ranma.</p><p><b></b>If little Washu was surprised she did not show it. The diminutive scientist just inclined her head. "I can spare the time, Saotome-san. I'm sure Yosho knows what he has to do. If you'd follow me…" she said and pushed yet another button on her door-maker.</p><p><b></b>Unsurprisingly another door appeared on the far wall and Nodoka smiled at her daughter. "It won't take long, dear. You go ahead and show Soun his room for the night. I'll follow shortly." she said and disappeared with little Washu through the door.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded while she asked herself what her mother could want of Washu. Shrugging to herself she got up. If her mother decided so she'd let her know soon enough. "Sure, mom. Mr. Tendo, if you'd follow me…"</p><p><b></b>Soun got up and nodded. "Of course, Ranma. But its time you stopped calling me Mr. Tendo. Just call me Soun; you've earned my respect more than enough."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl blushed and then smiled. "It would be my honour, Mr… Soun." she corrected herself with a sheepish smile. "This will need some getting used to…" she muttered to herself.</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch smiled and laid a hand on her shoulder. "Believe me, I know what you mean. To address you as <i>Ránma</i> needs some getting used to, too. But know that I accept you as much as the daughter of my best friend as his son. I made many mistakes in the past concerning you, Ranma, and I want to apologise for it." he said and bowed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma marvelled once more at the changes Soun Tendo had undergone since she'd seen him last. He seemed like a changed man, and changed for the better. If one could buy the stuff that had caused the change she'd be happy to donate a large quantity of it to her father. "Apology accepted if you accept mine." she said with a smile before she turned serious. "I know I did a lot of foolish things in the past because of my macho pride. Had I not always been so hell-bent of proving to anyone just how manly I am, things might have, no, would have gone better. However I believe that a relationship with Akane had no future. We are just too much alike, pride and all." she finished.</p><p><b></b>Soun felt hard pressed not to erupt into a demon-head, but he had to admit that Ranma was right. He sighed. "I slowly realise that it was a mistake to force you and Akane together. Neither you nor Akane were prepared for a marriage, and even the ceremony we tried to push you through would not have changed that fact. You went through much together, but it was apparently just not meant to be. Don't worry," he said with a slight smile, "I'm not mad at you. Rather I am happy for my oldest child that she found the love she deserved so much. And I promise on my honour as a martial artist that I will neither push the two of you to marry nor will I allow Genma to do anything stupid." he said solemnly.</p><p><b></b>The redhead was nearly awed at the change in Soun. "Th… thanks, Soun. I appreciate it. Sadly pops is neither known for thinking things through nor for his patience, and if he'd learn any of what you know he'd start pressuring us as soon as we'd get back to Nerima. Sure, I could probably clobber him to the moon and back but he'd still not let up." she said and sighed. "I <i>want</i> that this works out, more than anything in the world. I love Kasumi, both forms of her so much that I have the feeling that I'll burst to bits at any given moment. I'm sure you know what I mean." she finished with a smile, that soon turned forced as she was suddenly assaulted by a strange... twitch from somewhere within her body.</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch nodded with a wistful smile, oblivious to the redheads' discomfort. "Yes, Ranma. I know exactly what you mean for it was the same for me with my wife." he said. Then he visibly gathered himself and embraced a surprised redhead in a hug. "I'm glad that you found what you deserve and I'll do my utmost to help you along the way. But first before you return home enjoy your vacation. Its time you got a real one, Ranma." he said with a real smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled at the older man. "I'm glad too, Soun. Kasumi is all that I ever wished for in a partner and much more. He has helped me to accept myself better and is so caring and understanding and so much more. I know that I can lean into him for support if I need it and know that he'll be my firm rock in the surge, but I also know that she can lean as much into me for support. It's hard to describe, but with Kasumi I feel whole. That's also why I lost it when I thought I had lost him. I can't be without Kasumi any more, and I seriously don't know how I could ever be. I love Kasumi so much."</p><p><b></b>Soun smiled, happy that a troubled young individual had finally found his/her luck with one of his children. Over the past months he had realised, that Ranma did not deserve what had happened to him/her over the past year. To get constantly blamed for everything bad that happened around him/her had surely been unfair and very taxing, to put it mildly. "I'm glad Ranma, I'm glad for the two of you. How about you show me my room for the night now?" he asked, still smiling.</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded and ignored a sudden, even stronger twitch in her abdomen. With a somewhat forced smile because of her discomfort she motioned Soun to follow her and began walking towards the door. She opened it and stepped through, Soun following on her heels. As she had expected she exited on the first floor and stepped aside so that Soun could exit properly. She mused, that the vortex kept the 'traveller' on hold should the exit of the door be blocked, and once she'd made way Soun came out of the door immediately.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled at the awed look Soun had on his face, for it had been the same with her in face of little Washu's inventions. The fellow redhead was awesome, and it seemed as if there was nothing the diminutive scientist could not do. While she walked with Soun towards one of the guest room she idly wondered what her mother was doing at present…</p><p><b></b>Nodoka Saotome on her part was currently sitting in a chair in the medical wing of the lab, facing little Washu. The two women were deep in talk. "…so you see, my child told me that you're the worlds best scientist, and I figured if anyone could help me it would be you."</p><p><b></b>Little Washu smiled at the praise; she liked Ranma more from day to day and also her mother seemed to be quite okay despite her quirks. "And what would it be that I could help you with?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch blushed somewhat. "Well, I always wanted another child, yet when I gave birth to Ranma something happened and the doctors said I'd never be able to have another child. Now discovering that having a daughter is one of the nicest experiences I've ever made I wanted to ask you if you could examine me and maybe help me if possible. Having another child might also do my stupid husband a world of good, and this time the upbringing and education of the child will be up to me. I made this mistake once, and I will never repeat it. This I swear on my honour."</p><p><b></b>The other redhead looked sceptical. "Aha. And what would you do if your husband demands to take your hypothetic child on a training trip with him? How could you refuse it if he promised to make it a 'man among men' or a 'woman among women'?" she asked in an even voice and with a neutral face.</p><p><b></b>"I guess I deserved that." Nodoka said with a sigh. "Look, I was an eighteen year old girl with a lot of stupid ideas and ideals when I accepted that even stupider contract. My head was filled with fancy ideas and a lot of ideals I consider ludicrous and stupid in hindsight. I admit, had it not been for my prospective... well, it would be son-in-law at the moment, wouldn't it, I would probably still have my former views of manliness; I thank Kami-sama every day that He sent Kasumi to set me straight. So you see, I'd never allow Genma to take a prospective child of mine onto a training trip. Ever."</p><p><b></b>"I see." Washu said. "Go on."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded, thankful that Washu hadn't judged her harshly yet. "The only one who'd ever be allowed to do this would be Ranma. And I sure as hell would accompany them, come there hell or high water. Genma can not be trusted with children, that he has proven beyond a doubt. You can rest assured that I ensured, that Genma will not have a say in Ranma's further upbringing and education. He's done enough to my child for a life-time." she said with conviction.</p><p><b></b>Little Washu nodded, and her respect for the Saotome matriarch went up several notches. "I see, Saotome-san. Under the condition that you give me your word of honour to abide by what you just said I'll help you to the utmost of my abilities. But make no mistake, should you fall back into your old ways of manliness and all that crap I <i>will</i> know; and I have ways of dealing with that." she said and let her chojin-power leak into her voice.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka was suitably cowed and nodded. "I'd never dream of doing that to a child of mine again. Rather I'd commit Seppuku myself." she vowed and little Washu had little doubt that she'd follow on her word. "I nearly lost one child because of it, and I never want to happen that again."</p><p><b></b>The scientist nodded in satisfaction. "I should hope so. Ranma is a wonderful person, regardless which gender she's in, and we will help her as much as possible to come to terms with the curse. But your acceptance of Ranma as your daughter did her a world of good. She finally has the courage to discover a part of herself that was forbidden before. Had you not accepted Ranma she might have snapped under the stress at any given point in time; <i>nobody</i>, regardless how strong, can handle the stress she went through on a regular basis and escape its effects unscathed forever. She is exceptionally strong in mind and body, but even she has her limits. I imagine that she might have either snapped and gone on a rampage, or the milder option, she might have begun to wear girl's clothes in secret, trying to discover that part of herself in the hidden. For what happens if you're constantly told that something is forbidden?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka knew where this was headed. "The lure of the forbidden…" she whispered. "Kami-sama above, we really forbade her to discover a <i>complete part</i> of herself, didn't we? With forcing her to be manly regardless of the gender she never had a chance to be complete. And she always did act manly around me as to prove herself to me. It's no wonder she never seemed to be happy. I always had the impression, as if my child was feeling… sad and unhappy. Somehow incomplete. My motherly instincts may have been dimmed over the years from disuse, but I could feel it. Yet I forced her to act manly nevertheless once I knew of the curse. But no more! I'm going to treat my child according to the gender she is in; she's gone through enough already." she whispered with conviction and tears shimmering in her eyes.</p><p><b></b>Little Washu smiled. "Just remember to give her room to just be herself. Forcing her into something she's not would be completely wrong and would do more harm than good. Subtly encouraging her and giving advice is the course of action I'd suggest. She's been forced too often in her life in my opinion."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch nodded. "You're right, Washu-chan. Thank you for your insightful words." she said and bowed.</p><p><b></b>Washu-chan inclined her head. "You're welcome, Saotome-san."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled. "Please call me Nodoka. Anyone who's helped my child and her love as much as you have has more than earned this right."</p><p><b></b>The scientist nodded with the hint of a smile. "Alright, Nodoka-san. Now if you wish we can start the examinations."</p><p><b></b>Ranma's mother nodded. "Please."</p><p><b></b>In the following hour little Washu put Nodoka through some tests; nothing humiliating or embarrassing, for Washu used her advanced equipment that respected the privacy and dignity of her test-subject most. To Nodoka's delight Washu was indeed able to help and her and did just that. She also gave Nodoka the warning, that she was more than likely to carry twins should the conception take place.</p><p><b></b>Washu explained, that the probability to experience a twin-pregnancy rose for women past thirty and as she was thirty-six it could very well happen. A very happy Nodoka left the lab of Washu and used the door her daughter and Soun had used one hour ago.</p><p><b></b>In the meantime Ranma had shown Soun his room for the night and had retired to her own; her mother would sleep in the same room as she and as was obvious little Washu had already accommodated the room for it sported now two four-poster beds.</p><p><b></b>At first Ranma shook her head as if to clear it. It seemed little Washu had also adjusted the specs of the room at the same time, for it had nearly doubled in size in comparison to before. With a smile Ranma thought that apparently nothing was impossible for the crazy scientist.</p><p><b></b>As the room now held more than enough room to do a kata Ranma threw herself into one of the katas of moderate complexity. Due to her growing abilities it was child's play to her; or usually would have been. For something felt off and distracted her from throwing her all into the kata. And for the life of her, Ranma could not determine what it was that felt off. It was just an indistinguishable feeling which's origin she could not locate, accompanied by those irregular… twitches.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly she felt an even stronger twitch than before, and paused in her kata to locate its origins. As a martial artist she was very much aware of her body and knew it to the little toe; or more appropriately worded, she <i>had</i> come to know this body as much as she knew her male form from head to toe. After all, it was <i>her</i> body and she'd have it till the day she died, hopefully in the far future.</p><p><b></b>But as much as she tried, she could not determine the source of the twitches, and her petulance grew ever more. This was something she'd never felt or encountered before, something with which she'd no experience; thus she'd no idea what to do about it, but she felt that it would be silly to go to her mother saying "Mom, I've got strange twitches.". Finally fed up she threw herself on her four poster and switched the TV on. She had long since changed into a pj and tried to make herself as comfortable as possible. The girls' pjs had also been something she had to get used to. Apparently girls slept with the panties on while wearing a pj (or so her mother had told her), and that had irritated her greatly at first.</p><p><b></b>Indeed she was still wearing the briefs they had bought instead of panties but that was beside the point; it was <i>still</i> strange. Trying to get comfortable she watched TV for half an hour until she finally turned in. Ranma tried to ignore the odd twitches as much as possible and fell into a deep sleep due to sheer exhaustion, hopeful that the odd stomach bug she'd obviously caught would soon leave her alone.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka entered the room of her daughter ten minutes after Ranma had gone to sleep. Walking over to where Ranma was lying in her bed she smiled softly to herself. She looked so peaceful… wait. Why was she scrunching her face up so much? Hmm, it seemed as if something was troubling her. Worried Nodoka sat down on the bedside and felt the forehead of her daughter. No, she did not seem to have fever. With motherly concern she stroked her daughters' hair and noticed how soft it was.</p><p><b></b>This had always been her dream, to be there for a daughter; a daughter with whom she could share all the secrets that could only been shared between a mother and her daughter. Now Fate had provided her with a chance for that and Nodoka vowed that she'd use it. However, she also kept little Washu's words in mind that she should not forget the male half of her child, but for the next three months she'd have a full time daughter. So where was the harm in treating her like her daughter?</p><p><b></b>She continued to fondle her daughter and was pleased when a soft smile settled on Ranma's face. Slowly and silently Nodoka got up and immediately found the adjacent bathroom. Whoever had planned this house had done a superb job at it. A bedroom with an adjacent bathroom was a dream! Smiling to herself Nodoka prepared for the night and once she was done she went into her own four-poster and called it a night. Little did she know that the night would be rather short…</p><p><b>to be continued</b>…</p><p><b>Thanks to everyone for helping me out with suggestions, ideas and comments.</b></p><p><b>Many thanks to those of you who were kind enough to leave reviews for the last chapter: </b></p><p><b></b>Quontir, BrianDarksoul, neo82, Mozes, Rejhan, Ranko, Garahs, Hiryo, Slade13, ss4-link, LunaRoseAF, SlickRCBD, borg rabbit, Lord Oberon, AzureSky123, Van, TheWhiteMonk, Jerry Unipeg, Rose Vaughn, trunks and goten, kzinti7, JohnnyG, Martrex, Silverscale, Drakus, Brother Angelon, Light02, Wonderbee31</p>
