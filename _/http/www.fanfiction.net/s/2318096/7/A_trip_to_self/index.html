No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 7: The 'talk'</b></p><p><b></b>Nodoka Saotome was shaking her head. Never in her whole life would she have imagined that Genma would have... could have been so ignorant towards her child's education. She had hardly been able to believe Kasumi when the oldest Tendo daughter had told her just how much Ranma did not know.</p><p><b></b>But after she had come to see a lot of examples for her child's lack of knowledge in the last months she had been all the more glad that Kasumi had started to tutor Ranma. Although it was now very obvious that Ranma was still ignorant towards a lot of life's facts. Facts that her child needed to know. And it all seemed to be Genma's fault.</p><p><b></b>She would have to have a loooong talk with her dear husband. One that he would not forget so soon. But first things first. First she needed to give her son-turned-daughter the 'talk'. "Ranma, this will probably be a bit embarrassing for you. If you want to, we can talk upstairs."</p><p><b></b>Ranma was still unsure what was going on. She still had no inkling of what they meant with the 'talk'. And what had talking to do with all this weird stuff like 'cycle', 'period' and all this? Inwardly she sighed. The life of a martial artist was indeed fraught with peril. But sadly all this peril seemed to be caused by her idiot father. Stupid panda!</p><p><b></b>Nabiki looked at the pigtailed girl with an amused expression. <b>'A <i>bit</i> embarrassing? Make that lots'</b>. the middle Tendo daughter thought. "Saotome, believe me, you <i>want</i> to go upstairs. Trust me on this one." she said. She still remembered how Kasumi had given her the 'talk'. It had been... interesting. And she would never record the talk between Nodoka and her son-turned-daughter. Not even she was so unethical.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch looked at her son-turned-daughter, who shrugged. She had no opinion towards this 'talk' and would let herself be surprised. Cologne however stopped Nodoka with a cough. "Yes, Elder Cologne?"</p><p><b></b>"Just Cologne, child." the Elder smiled.</p><p><b></b>"Only if you call me Nodoka." the Saotome matriarch countered, also smiling.</p><p><b></b>"Of course. Nodoka-san, I can clear one point up. The cursed body of a Jusenkyo victim <i>is</i>, as I told you, fully functional. It is <i>imperative</i> that you give son-in-law the 'talk'."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded. She had wanted to do so anyway as soon as possible, as she had suspected something like that even before her conversation with the Elder. The body of the female Ranma was far too convincing to be only superficial. And what Cologne had told her had made it final. Ranma had the full biological potential of a woman and really was her daughter when in girl form. And her child <i>needed</i> to know the facts of life. "That I will do. Follow me, Ranma. Kasumi, could you help me?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma shrugged once more and followed her mother, as did Kasumi. The oldest Tendo daughter already knew what Nodoka wanted and had planned ahead. "You can use my room, Auntie. The bed has been replaced and the flooring is repaired, so feel free to use it. I'll go and get the necessary items."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch smiled. She <i>had</i> been right. There was much, <i>much </i>more to Kasumi Tendo than met the eye. Ever since she had known Kasumi she had suspected that the oldest Tendo daughter was at least as clever and cunning as Nabiki, if need be.</p><p><b></b>But unlike Nabiki, the oldest Tendo daughter did not hide her intelligence behind an indifferent mask of ice, but behind a mask of serenity, pleasantness and apparent obliviousness. That Kasumi had caught on as quickly as she had, had only proven the point.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka and Ranma entered Kasumi's room, and both sat down on the new bed. "Ranma," the Saotome matriarch began and smiled reassuringly at her son-turned-daughter, "I know it is difficult, but you need to know this. There are things about a girls' body that you don't know, things that I would have taught you had you been born my daughter. As it is, due to your curse you <i>are</i> my daughter from time to time. And you will be at least for half of the time for the rest of your life. That is why you must know your female body, Ranma. You just can't afford to ignore it, daughter, for it will be a part of you forever."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded reluctantly. She still felt primarily as a guy, but she could see her mothers point. If she had the curse for the rest of her life, she had to know this body rather than ignore it. Ignoring it could lead to great danger for herself, that she had come to know in the past.</p><p><b></b>As Nodoka wanted to continue, Kasumi entered the room with examples of feminine hygiene and sanitary supplies. Ranma did not know what they were, but she had the distinct feeling that she <i>would</i> know soon enough. Most probably sooner than she'd have liked. Nodoka nodded and smiled at the oldest Tendo child and mouthed a 'thanks'.</p><p><b></b>The eldest Tendo daughter laid the items on the new bed, nodded towards Nodoka and excused herself, but before she left she gave Ranma an encouraging smile. Nodoka noticed it and also the answering smile of her son-turned-daughter, and the Saotome matriarch smiled to herself. Then she braced herself for the 'talk' with her child. "Ranma-chan," Ranma winced at the female suffix, "I'll give you the same talk my mother gave me. Kami-sama knows I never expected I would have to give it to you, as you were born my son, but it seems Fate had other plans."</p><p><b></b>And with this Nodoka Saotome began to give her son-turned-daughter the 'talk'. And Ranma grew progressively whiter the more Nodoka told her. When Nodoka had ended, Ranma was as white as chalk and looked nearly as inanimate.</p><p><b></b>Then life slowly returned and for a few moments Ranma only sputtered incoherently before she had gathered her bearings enough to form something at least resembling a coherent sentence. "Oh my Kami-sama... you mean to say that girls... that... that..." all of Ranma's' higher brain-functions were abruptly shut down once more, and nothing more came forth. Add to it that she had started to colour again, but not in a healthy way. Ranma looked now decidedly green.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded empathically. "I know, Ranma. But it is normal for girls."</p><p><b></b>"But I am a guy, mom!" Ranma wailed.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled. "Who turns into a <i>girl</i> when splashed with cold water. I thought we had established that you're my son as well as my daughter, dear. Besides, it is something <i>all</i> girls go through."</p><p><b></b>Ranma still could not think very clearly. "Ya... ya <i>really</i> mean ta say... that girls are... down there... every month? Eugh!" she exclaimed, and once more Ranma had slipped into slang due to the pressure the situation was exerting on her.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka stroked her son-turned-daughter's back and then put her arms around her child. "I won't deny that statement, Ranma-chan. It <i>is</i> messy and all around a pain in the... well, you know where." <b>'Or at least you soon will.'</b> she added mentally.</p><p><b></b>Then she smiled in a (what she hoped) encouraging way. "But it <i>is</i> also normal for a woman, my child. Ranma, you <i>must</i> get used to your curse, else it will destroy you. You heard Elder Cologne. There <i>is</i> no cure, so you'll be a girl for half of the time for the rest of your life. And I know you well enough to know for sure that you are no one to sit and hide in a house. You will always be prone to changing genders. Isn't it so?"</p><p><b></b>Reluctantly Ranma nodded. Her mother had got that right. She'd never hide in a house only to remain a guy for as much time as possible. Especially since she slowly had gotten used to her female side after Jusendo. There and then she had already sensed that her chances to get cured of the curse were nearly zero, and after what Cologne had told them she knew that her chances were now zero or below. And she really believed Cologne, as the Elder had nothing to gain through lying to them.</p><p><b></b>No, she'd never hide in a house, and her mother knew this. Yes, her mother was right, she'd change genders at random for the rest of her life, as things looked. "Yeah, mom. It is so." she said with a sigh.</p><p><b></b>Her mother gave her an understanding smile and hugged her once more. Now that her child had accepted this it was time to crumble another of her defences. Time for the big guns. "My child, this whole enterprise is to allow you to understand your femininity as well as your masculinity. You are both sides of a coin, Ranma-chan. Elder Cologne has made this clear to me. But you can't really understand your femininity without experiencing one of the most important experiences in a woman's life. And besides, billions of women go through this on a regular basis. Even girls a lot younger than you. Do you mean to say that you are weaker than them? Or even me?"</p><p><b></b>Instantly Ranma felt challenged, and her eyes lit up. Now Nodoka knew for sure that she had pushed the right buttons. Yes, she had read her child correctly. Ranma never backed down from a challenge, and she had presented her child one.</p><p><b></b>Had Nodoka Saotome known her child a bit better she would have known that the look Ranma wore now was exactly the same look that Ranma had worn any time when he/she had entered a crucial battle. Like the all decisive battles against Herb or Saffron, for example. It was the look that said 'I can take on anything'.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch had her child now where she wanted Ranma, hook, line and sinker. "No way!" Ranma exclaimed in the breast-note of confirmedness. "If Shampoo, Ukyo or even a lunatic like Kodachi can do it, so can I! Bah, if even the uncute tomboy can do it, Ranma Saotome can too! Now please explain those thingies, mom."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded and did just that. In the end Ranma decided that she would use a sanitary towel when her time of the month would come. She had shuddered when her mother had explained the tampon. No freaking way was she gonna insert a thing like that <i>there</i>!The thought alone was enough to drive her up the walls.</p><p><b></b>Her mother also mentioned the possibility of cramps that would most likely precede the actual period or even be a concomitant as well as maybe a headache or even migraine that might accompany her time. As well as the possibility of severe mood-swings that might occur. Just dandy. But her mother also mentioned that there were several medications like midol, for example, which would make it somewhat easier.</p><p><b></b>Although Ranma did not like it (and she mused that a lot of girls around the globe didn't like it either) she grudgingly accepted it as being a part of the challenge to find her femininity. And she'd face this challenge like every other challenge she'd ever faced: head on and with everything she got.</p><p><b></b>Then, much to Ranmas eternal embarrassment, her mother began to explain all the sensitive areas of a girls' body, the different body parts and their functions. The pigtailed girl was sure that she could have lighted up a street with her blush, and she couldn't help but to exclaim a soft "Oh my!" when her mother had finished her explanations.</p><p><b></b>Her mother understood this all too well, after all, she had reacted the same way when <i>her</i> mother had explained the basics to her. Thus she embraced her still blushing daughter and softly stroked her hair until Ranma had slowly gathered her bearings again. Which was quite necessary, as another important topic had still to be broached. Namely the explanation of where the grandchildren came from.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka had decided that she would only explain the part of the female, as she was sure that Ranma could get enough information about the male part from it. Aside from that, she was simply uncomfortable with explaining the other part explicitly. And if Ranma would not gather what the male part was it would be high time that dearest did his part and explained it.</p><p><b></b>Inwardly the Saotome matriarch hoped that her husband would act upon his duties, though she knew him well enough to know that he'd probably not. But luckily there were still other sources of information, like the internet, for example. Maybe even Kasumi, who was now half a man herself, could be of help in this regard.</p><p><b></b>But however it might turn out, Nodoka Saotome wanted her daughter to be well informed. Even if her Ranma might never act on her biological potential, she had to know the facts of life.</p><p><b></b>And then Nodoka explained the basics of physical love and pleasure to her daughter, who blushed once more a bright red. No, even if she had the biological potential to do <i>that</i> she could never imagine herself doing <i>it</i> as a female. At the moment she looked nearly physically sick at the thought of letting any guy near... near it. No, sooner it would snow in hell.</p><p><b></b>After Nodoka was certain that Ranma had understood everything, she had to broach another topic. "Daughter, I want you to be <i>very</i> careful with your female body. Only because you were born my son and because you are a top-notch martial artist it does not mean that you could not get raped. There might always be situations in which you might end up helpless, so please, don't be overconfident in your abilities and try your utmost to avoid such situations. There are a lot of bad people out there in the world, people who won't hesitate to use underhanded tricks to get what they want. You could even end up pregnant, Ranma-chan. I talked with Elder Cologne, and she told me that your cursed form is completely female, including the biological potential. So promise me that you will be very careful." she said with obvious care in her voice and eyes.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had blanched again when the implications of what her mother had said had sunken in. Instinctively she clenched her thighs shut, and her resolve grew  way in hell was she gonna let any guy do <i>that</i> to her. Never! Then she composed herself and nodded solemnly. "I promise, mother."<b> 'And I promise that I'll blow any freak up that tries to get into my boxers!' </b>she added mentally and with conviction.</p><p><b></b>Before her mother had given her the talk and before she had somewhat begun to accept the fact that her female side would be with her forever her strong self-image as a male had never made the assumption that the reason why so many boys were flirting with her girl-side was because they wanted to do… <i>that</i> with her. Disgusting little freaks!</p><p><b></b>Then she stopped herself as she realised that such thoughts were along the lines of what Akane would think of boys, and she also remembered that one simply could not lump every boy together. After all, she was no pervert when she was a boy.</p><p><b></b>Hmm, instead of blowing every boy up who'd make advances towards her she'd rather decline said advances and reinforce her declinature if need be. Yes, that was a good course of action. And maybe she'd also get some good training out of those who were too dumb to get the wink…</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Nodoka had nodded at the answer of her child and embraced Ranma once more. She was really glad that Kasumi had managed to talk her out of this whole manliness fixation, for thus she'd have the chance to come to know the daughter Ranma could have been had she been born female.</p><p><b></b>At first she had been stubborn, and she knew that she had not made it easy for Kasumi during their talks. But when the oldest Tendo child, who Nodoka had viewed as another traditional Japanese woman before she had received her curse, and who she respected very much, had compared her view of manliness to the teachings and opinions of her husbands master Happosai, she had had to admit that Kasumi was right.</p><p><b></b>It had taken some more talks after that, but finally her defences had crumbled. After that she had made a clean slate, and from there on Kasumi and she had developed a concept of manliness respectively gentlemanliness that could be applied to Ranma even with his Jusenkyo curse. And the concept of her child striving to become a gentle person rather than a man among men was something from which Ranma would benefit so much more.</p><p><b></b>During their talks Kasumi had made Nodoka realise just how much pressure and stress her constant insistence on Ranma being manly had put on her child, something that she now knew was doomed to fail. For how should her child remain manly if he was in constant danger of changing genders?</p><p><b></b>She had come to know that the water-magnet part of the curse was a fact, so what should Ranma have done to satisfy her former view of manliness? Change back immediately? Would only work for so long and was a very temporary solution. Hide in a house to remain in male form? That thought alone was, given Ranma's character and energy, utterly ridiculous.</p><p><b></b>No, the new concept Kasumi and she had developed worked in Ranma's favour, as her child was now able to get a grip onto his/her life while still being someone who could be an example. What Cologne had said about the curses had sealed it, and Nodoka meant it when she said that she viewed Ranma as well as a daughter and as a son.</p><p><b></b>But there still remained some more things Ranma had to know about her female side. "Good, daughter." she said with a smile. "I am sure you already have noticed several differences between your current gender and the birthform in the time that you have had your curse. How did you come to terms with the different way of plumbing, for example? And please, keep an eye onto your language skills. No daughter of mine speaks like a roughneck. Understood?"</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girl looked somewhat embarrassed and then she smiled sheepishly. "Yes, mother. At first it was no problem, as pop and me travelled through the wilderness of China. And par for the course it was the rainy season while we travelled, which means I was a girl most of the time. One time for nearly three whole weeks! Except for when pop and me pitched up the tents and were able to heat some water, that is. But now I know what could have happened had I finished my cycle, and I'm sure I would have died of embarrassment! I would probably have thought I had some internal injury and were dying or something. And baka oyaji would probably have run off screaming had I told him I was bleeding… ah… down there. Idiot panda. I can't believe he never told me the facts of life. Honestly!"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch nodded. "Yes, dear, I can imagine that your father would have reacted… badly to you starting your period. Ever since he started training under this perverted master of his he became so darn medieval in his attitude towards women. He even thanked the Kami when you were born our son. Although I can understand that he wanted a son and heir. But I think between the two of us we will manage to convince him that women are anything but weak. Ne, daughter?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma could not help herself, she had to smile at what her mother had said. Maybe it was some sort of cosmic justice that she was, now and forever, also the daughter of Genma Saotome. Heh, served the stupid misogynistic panda right.</p><p><b></b>She was still somewhat unused to that her mother would call her 'daughter', but did it really matter as long as her mother loved her as she was? She had hoped for so long that she would be accepted by her mother as she was before she had been judged, and now her mother had even accepted her curse and viewed her as both her son and her daughter, depending on the weather or the odd cold-water-accident. It would take some getting used to, but she was sure that she would manage. After all, it was far better than ending up being forced to commit Seppuku.</p><p><b></b>Thus she smiled about what her mother had said. "Even though I still say that I'm a guy in here," she said and pointed to her temple, "I must admit that I liked to teach baka oyaji a lesson as a girl. And I'll be glad to repeat it as often as need be. You know, sometimes I think that we got cursed for a reason. Baka pop because he already was fat and lazy from day one of our training trip and because he rolled off all his problems to me, and I because I really thought that girls were weak and worthless. The only difference between us is that I have learned from my mistakes. What do you say to the idea of a repeat performance of what I did to him? We could call it the Anything Goes panda socialisation, fried panda guaranteed." she said in a sweet tone while cracking her knuckles.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded with a glint in her eyes. Having Ranma teach her father some manners and correct behaviour on how to treat women was a good idea, considering her strength. That could do her dear husband a world of good, even if he would have to go through a world of hurt to learn it.</p><p><b></b>But how had dearest always said: 'the path of a true martial artist is fraught with peril'. It seemed Genma would come to know with exactly how much peril it was <i>really</i> fraught. "You have my permission to handle his reeducation. I have been much too lax with him ever since he returned from the training trip because I was simply so glad that you two had returned, but now it really is time that he stopped being so misogynistic. We live in the 21st century after all, and his attitude is unbearable. I can imagine that he gave you a hard time when you were a girl during your way back to Japan, my dear."</p><p><b></b>Her son-turned-daughter nodded and grimaced in remembrance. "He'd always demand that I change back immediately into his manly son and stop being such a disgrace, such a weak, worthless girl. Even though we had absolutely no hot water available most of the time. You wouldn't believe how often I challenged him to a sparring match just to knock him out so that he stopped his idiotic harping about how weak and worthless girls are. That was also the time when I began to realise for the first time that girls are anything but what baka oyaji had always taught me. I began to doubt his teachings about women, for I had turned into a girl, and I surely was not weak. At first I thought I was the exception to the rule and still treated other girls this way, but after I met Shampoo, Akane and Ukyo and all the other girls I completely realised that pops teachings are a big pile of bullcrap. But I still kept my macho façade up so that idiot pop wouldn't harp at me more than necessary. After all, it was more than enough that he was always chewing on my ear regarding Akane and the so important 'Joining of the schools'."</p><p><b></b>Her mother nodded proudly. "Ranma, I'm really pleased that you recognised the attitude of your father regarding women as what it is. Utterly moronic. And I am truly sorry that I ever allowed your father to take you with him onto the training trip, but at this time I was a young and foolish woman. I was eighteen years old and had my head filled with visions of how manly my son would become, and your father promised me to make you the manliest man there is plus the best martial artist in the world. He convinced me to sign this stupid contract, and for ten years it was the only thing that reminded me of you, my child. In the end your father succeeded, but at too high a cost. I didn't see you for ten long years, my child, and it is all my fault. I hope you can forgive me." she said softly and dropped her head in shame and sorrow.</p><p><b></b>What her mother had said had moved Ranma deeply, and tears were glistening in the corners of her eyes when she moved to embrace her mother in a hug. "Ohh mom, of course I forgive you! I always knew that you had not abandoned me, even when I thought you were dead. And all the time I missed you so much, and I couldn't bear the thought that I'd never see you again. Pop let me believe that you had passed away, and you can't believe how happy I was when I saw you for the first time again, even if I had to pretend to be Ranko Tendo to be near you. But pop made it seem as if you'd force me to commit Seppuku should you find out that I turn into a girl. He also said that was why he let me believe that you were dead. And I believed it when I came to know you. You always carried your katana with you and boasted about how manly your son must be. I admit that it was… unsettling."</p><p><b></b>This time her mother deepened the hug, and Nodoka Saotome shed tears. "I'm so sorry for what I put you through, my child. Kasumi made it clear to me what I was still doing to you although I had deemed the contract fulfilled. She said that there was the distinct possibility that you'd be a girl for half of the time for the rest of your life, and when she pointed out that you had never had any luck with cures for your curse I slowly started to believe her. Every try to cure your curse had led to failure, and I'm sure not because of lack of trying on your part. And what Cologne said made it final. You'll be my daughter for half of the time from now on and forever, and because of this I'm very glad that you came to see that girls and women are not weak and worthless. I accept you as my daughter as well as my son, and if husband does not see reason I'll <i>make</i> him see reason. I'm sure you are interested in helping me, aren't you, daughter?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded with an evil glint in her eyes. If she liked to teach the panda a lesson and make him see reason to boot? Was the sun hot? "I'd be more than happy to, mom. And I forgive you. I'm sure you only had the best for me in mind, even if the decision to leave the carrying out to oyaji was not the best one. Rather far from it. When I have my own children you'll understand that I won't leave even an inkling of their upbringing to him, don't you, mom? That he didn't tell me even an inkling of the stuff you told me… I can't believe him."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded. "Yes, my dear, I can more than understand it and I can't blame you for your attitude. But I'd be glad if you'd let me participate in the upbringing of future grandchildren. And I thank you for forgiving me." she said and placed a kiss on her daughters forehead. Inwardly she thought happy thoughts about all the grandchildren she'd be able to spoil in the future, and she was also very glad that her child had forgiven her the mistakes she had made. "But I think I can clear up why your father never told you anything about the facts of life, my child."</p><p><b></b>Now the pigtailed girl looked really interested. "What on earth could be more important than to tell their own child what is going on when their child comes into puberty? Wait, let me guess: it has something to do with some stupid training idea of pops, right?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch grimaced. "Not too far from the truth, daughter. I only found out after your father had taken you on the trip that he had another reason why he took you with him. He kept a journal he had forgotten to take with him, and I found out some interesting things. His goal was not only to make you the best martial artist of your generation and a man among men, but he wanted to get you away from me. Dearest feared that my motherly influence on you would make you go weak and soft, and thus he decided to raise you by himself. I suspect that he never told you about the facts of life because it could have distracted you from the art, and he probably feared that you'd suddenly show interest in the 'weak and worthless girls' of the world. By keeping you ignorant he sought to minimise this 'danger'. But when you became a girl yourself at Jusenkyo husband probably blew all fuses he had. Imagine he would have needed to give you the talk there and then, after you got cursed. Then he would have had to give you the talk for both sides, and I don't think dearest would have survived it." she ended, snickering.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part steamed silently. "I always knew that he had a lousy opinion of women, but that he took me away from you because he thought you'd make me go soft and weak… panda no baka! And seeing women as a distraction from the art... when I see him next time I'm gonna punt him to the next ward! And hopefully he'll end up in a zoo or something!"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka took her child into her arms. "I know how you feel, daughter. When I found out about what he had planned and why I was so angry that I shredded all training dummies I had. And when I had you back and found out that the panda was indeed my husband, I showed him my displeasure. Remember that your father walked quite strangely after I found out about you?" Ranma nodded. "I showed him just <i>how</i> displeased I was with him. But it seems he needs to be reminded from time to time. But what were your experiences as a girl in China, my child?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma leant back and grimaced. "Due to idiotic pops, who made it a constant torture, not so good experiences. He was constantly harping at me, and I really regretted that I had no staple gun ta staple his idiotic mouth shut. Even as a panda he was annoying, as he somehow learned ta write on signs. And if I did not react ta them he used them ta bop me over the head with them. It is a small wonder that I retained enough calm and did not force-feed those stupid signs ta him."she said, still steaming in remembrance at how stupid her father had acted back then. Admittedly, he did not act better nowadays, but that was beside the point.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch nodded once more. It really seemed as if severe behavioural modifications were long overdue for her husband. Should he continue his attitude towards their daughter in special and towards women in general they'd have to have a long talk on top of what she and Ranma had in mind for her dearest husband. One talk that would make the one they had had several years ago look like a walk in the park.</p><p><b></b>Oh, it would just be too nice if she could get her daughter to take up learning the Art of the sword. Then Ranma too could keep her father in line with a sharp sword. After all, a sharp katana was more often than not better than words. Especially if the user knew how to handle a sword. "I understand, Ranma-chan. And thank you for leaving him intact. Although he is an idiot, I still love him. But that does not mean that he can carry on the way he has, for his leeway is over. But I repeat myself. Continue to tell me of your experiences and remember to talk properly, daughter."</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded. "All in all it was not too bad after a while. But when I turned into a girl for the first time and noticed that my manliness was gone I exploded. I chased baka oyaji for what seemed like hours, and that was also when we accidentally cursed Ryoga. But I was so angry at stupid pop that I didn't even notice! Due to him I had turned into what he had taught me to despise! I had turned into what I believed to be a weak and worthless girl. But as said, over time I learned that his teachings were worth a shit."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded. "As I said, daughter, I will ensure that he will never teach your children anything without your explicit permission. What I learned of your training trip from Kasumi was gruesome, to say the least."</p><p><b></b>Ranma grimaced. <b>'You don't know the half of it.'</b> she thought. "You can say that again, mom. As for the plumbing, during the time in the wilderness it was no problem, I'd just pee wherever I wanted, even if it was totally different from what I was used to. But the worst happened when idiot pop and me returned to civilisation and I used a public restroom for the first time. I had tried to use the men's bathroom, but got stopped by some man who reminded me of my gender. And it didn't help any when I said that I was a guy." she said with a lopsided smile and paused to take a breath.</p><p><b></b>"Thus I had no choice but to use the women's bathroom, and I didn't want to risk changing back in the ladies bathroom as it was rather full at that time. If I had changed back they probably would have cried 'pervert!' and hunted me down. But when I tried to pee in the lavatory I peed all over my shoes! And those were new ones I had bought from the money I had saved during the trip! Money I had had to hide from baka oyaji for months! You can imagine that the baka panda had to run for his life after this incident. And you wouldn't believe how fast he can run…" she ended with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled, and she didn't know why, but mentally she saw her daughter Ranma chasing a panda with a katana. Odd. "But I can, Ranma. Several years ago, before your trip, I had a talk with him after he had displeased me with his attitude, and your father had tried to run for it. I convinced him that running was not an option, and he remembered it very well for the following months. I see that you overcame these specific differences. Aside from the obvious physical differences there are also a lot of other differences which are not so obvious on first look. But I trust Kasumi will be of great help in that regard. From our talks I know for a fact that she has great medical knowledge, so ask and listen to her, or rather him, if you have questions. Beside what happens to your body when you'll start your first period there are a lot of things you should know, daughter. They are not things you have to worry about, but facts of life you should know. And believe me when I say that Kasumi is better qualified than me to tell you these things."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. She too had noticed long ago that there was a lot more to Kasumi than met the eye, and it would surely be fun to find out just how much more. That might prove to be a decent challenge. "Okay, mom. But one thing is for sure: if I ever have a daughter and pops starts ranting at her that she is a weak and worthless girl and a disgrace to the Saotome name, then I will give the idiot Panda a one-way-trip to the moon, all expenses paid. Ever since I knew that he had taught me shit and especially ever since the tutoring sessions with Kasumi I asked myself how I should have a successful relationship with a girl if I treated her the way pop had taught me. Do you think it is any wonder why I had such a bad start with Akane? No, his attitude has to change. And to say that I'd love to expel his woman hating ways out of him is like saying that green is sometimes used by plants. I don't want to be treated this way by him and I sure as hell don't want my future children to be treated so. Count me in, mom." she said with a devilish grin.</p><p><b></b>Her mother nodded once more. She was very satisfied with the 'talk' and with her child. "I'm happy to, Ranma. And I'm glad that you could accept what I had to tell you. You are my daughter as much as my son, and I love to have the chance to come to know both sides of you. And this won't change ever. I promise." she said and got up. Then both Saotome women embraced each other in a hug. No words were needed as both mother and son-turned-daughter silently told the other how much they loved the one another.</p><p><b></b>When Nodoka released Ranma from the hug she noticed that evening was approaching, and she felt tired. The Saotome matriarch could hardly believe that all that had only happened in one day. And what a day it had been! A day of realisations and change. <b>'Maybe a change for the better. Finally.'</b> she mused.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly Ranma's stomach growled rather loudly. "Oops." she said, smiling sheepishly.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka laughed. "No need to be embarrassed. I admit that I'm quite hungry too. Which is no wonder after that day."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "I'll go and see if I can help Kasumi in the kitchen. See ya downstairs mom!"</p><p><b></b>And with that her energetic part-time-daughter bounded out of the room and down the stairs. It was a small wonder how good Ranma had turned out despite of what she now knew Genma had provided as an upbringing. And under Kasumi's tutelage her child had improved dramatically.</p><p><b></b>Yes, the oldest Tendo girl might be the right choice in a wife for her child. But Nodoka had learned her lessons. <i>This</i> time, she would leave the decision to Ranma. And naturally Kasumi. That did not mean, however, that she could not give them a certain push wherever it was needed.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka also saw a problem that might hinder the progress Ranma and Kasumi needed to make with the acceptance of their curses and hopefully with their personal lives.</p><p><b></b>How should they get used to their curses with the constant interferences that were so prominent in the Nerima ward? Hmm, that needed thinking. Sooner or later she would come up with something, she was sure. Caught up in her thoughts and inwardly quite proud of Ranma, Nodoka went downstairs.</p><p><b>A bit earlier... </b></p><p><b></b>With a growling stomach Ranma bounded down the stairs and jumped down the last few steps. The stares that greeted her were however not what she had expected. "What?" she asked, after the staring continued.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki finally voiced what all were thinking. "I guess what we all want to know, Saotome... how did it go?" she asked smirking.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed somewhat. "Not too bad. But I gotta admit... there is <i>much</i> more to being a woman than I'd thought!" she admitted.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded. "So you'll follow our advice, son-in-law?"</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded back. "I will. If millions 'n millions of women can go through it, so can <i>I</i>!"</p><p><b></b>The Joketsuzoku matriarch had to hide her smirk. So Nodoka had discovered how to push Ranma's buttons, had she? Confront the child with a challenge that was to her benefit, and you had Ranma hook, line and sinker. "I believe you can, child."</p><p><b></b>Shampoo boggled, hardly able to believe it. "Airen live as girl-type then?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Yup. And I bet that will annoy baka oyaji to no end!" she exclaimed happily. "Now excuse me, I'll go and see if I can help Kasumi in the kitchen."</p><p><b></b>That brought grins to the faces of everyone save for Shampoo, of course, who's brain was still shut down from what Ranma had said. Nabiki however, was soon hanging to her own thoughts. She had seen how Kasumi had reacted towards Ranma, in both forms.</p><p><b></b>She was not quite innocent regarding the failure of Akane's and Ranma's relationship, but she vowed that she would help her older sister (and now sometimes brother) where she could. Now she knew how Ranma really was, and she'd do her damn best to ensure her sister, or brother, depending on the weather, and Ranma would have all the chances. Therefore she'd have to device a plan which would eliminate all the crazies from the picture. Nodding to herself as the first ideas formed she busied herself with planning.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma had entered the kitchen, and was somewhat surprised to see a male Kasumi standing at the stove. Kasumi-otoko looked up from the stove and smiled. "I really would never have thought that the curse would turn one into such a water-magnet. It is unbelievable!" he exclaimed with his deep baritone, and Ranma smiled back. Yes, that she knew from experience.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "I know what you mean. I have literally seen water flow up the hills to reach me. The others find it hard to believe, but curse-victims really <i>do</i> turn into water-magnets." she said. "What was it in your case?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko grinned, showing two lines of perfectly white teeth. Even the ponytail suited him in this form, although it was a tidbit too long. But it made him look good. "I just took out the garbage after I came from upstairs and got splashed. The hot-water kettle is nearly ready, so we can change back soon."</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist nodded once more. "I wanted to ask if I could help you with the lunch, Kasumi."</p><p><b></b>Now it was Kasumi's turn to nod. "That's nice of you. If you want, you can prepare the salad. Wait, I'll get it for you from the fridge."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi did just that. In passing by he slightly brushed Ranma. He didn't notice at first and sure didn't do it voluntarily, but he noticed the spark that went through his body upon the contact.</p><p><b></b>The same could be said for Ranma. She knew that Kasumi would never do something like that of her, or better his, own accord, but that did not change the fact that it send sparks through her body and simply felt good.</p><p><b></b>"Ranma, I..." Kasumi-otoko began.</p><p><b></b>"Kasumi, I..." Ranma said at the same time.</p><p><b></b>Both blushed, and Kasumi was the first to talk. "You first, Ranma-chan. After all, you're the lady at the moment." he said, a smile playing in the corner of his mouth.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed some more. "Kasumi, I wanted to say how much it means to me that you stood by me all the time. And that you gave me this training. And so much more I can't even count. I promise that I will do everything I can to help you. And I want to say that I like you."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled. It was not the serene smile of Kasumi-chan, but equally capturing. "Thank you, Ranma. That means a lot. And I like you too." he said and hugged her.</p><p><b></b>At first Ranma was surprised, but then she hugged Kasumi-otoko back. And it felt <i>good</i>. Even more so than the brief brush a few moments ago. <i>Why</i> did it feel so good? Heck, who cared. As long as it did...</p><p><b></b>It was also a very good feeling for Kasumi-otoko, equally good compared to the feeling when Ranma-kun had hugged her female form some time ago after she had been cursed. Who knew, maybe she or rather he, at the moment had a chance at Ranma...</p><p><b></b>Had Nodoka seen Ranma and Kasumi in this position, she would have squealed in joy and would have probably begun to select names for grandchildren. But Kasumi and Ranma soon noticed that they were enjoying the hug a wee bit too much and separated politely, but not without a slight blush.</p><p><b></b>"Ehh," Ranma said, "you said you wanted me to prepare the salad, Kasumi?" she asked with a somewhat teasing undertone.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko blushed once more. "Oh my, yes, Ranma. One moment." he answered.</p><p><b></b>This time the venture to the fridge went by without any incident (much to both Ranma's and Kasumi's silent regret) and Kasumi handed the salad to Ranma. "Thanks. And here's your first lesson in manliness, although you handle your male form quite well," said Ranma while she applied her martial arts skill to preparing the salad, "a guy does not say 'Oh my'. 'Oops' or 'Yeah' is allowed, but not 'Oh my'. Okay, Kasumi?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. It seemed he had a lot to learn about being a guy, but as had Ranma about being a girl. He was sure that they could teach one another a lot, if only the chaos Nerima was so well renowned for would not inevitably come in their way. "Okay. But you realise that you'll have to go the full way when our training begins, don't you? That does mean <i>no</i> boxers. You'll have to wear the proper female undergarments, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>At seeing Ranma's blank look Kasumi clarified and could not suppress a smirk. "Panties and bra, Ranma-chan. Every woman's normal undergarments." he said, using the female suffix voluntarily.</p><p><b></b>Ranma shook her head frenetically. "I ain't gonna wear no girl's underwear!"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled. He knew how to counter that one. "Ranma-chan, when you focus on learning a new technique, do you only learn the parts that are of interest to you or do you strive to learn it as a whole?" he asked, keeping his voice and face straight while preparing the trap.</p><p><b></b>The expression on Ranmas face showed that she'd taken the bait. And that hook, line and sinker. Ranma was indeed thinking about martial arts techniques. The Bakusai Tenketsu for example. Even if you had learned the technique, it was worthless without the toughening part. "That ain't hard. Of course ya gotta learn the whole thing. Else it's worthless as ya might miss sumthin important. But what has that gotta do..."</p><p><b></b>Then it obviously dawned on her, and she locked eyes with Kasumi. "Ya mean what I think ya mean, doncha?"</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo sibling nodded, and once more he noticed that Ranma's command of the language slipped when the Saotome youth was under stress. They'd have to do something about it. "Yes, Ranma-chan. And please watch your language. You slipped into slang again. Besides, there is another, more practical reason why you shouldn't wear boxers while you're locked as a girl."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked sheepish for a moment, but then her resolve grew. Her mother had brought the point home, and Kasumi had now cemented it. "I understand the part what with learning it as a whole and accept it. But what is the other reason?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded smiling before answering. "Your mother just told you everything about what will happen when you'll start your time. And as I am quite sure that you haven't chosen the tampon," here Ranma winced, "which I can fully understand, you will need to wear panties. Pads and boxers just won't work together, Ranma-chan. Besides, I imagine that wearing boxers for three or more months straight will be very uncomfortable."</p><p><b></b>Slowly Ranma nodded. What Kasumi had said made sense. "Okay, I'll do it. But not before we lock ourselves. You saw yourself how superb it is to be a guy in panties, so you surely understand my point of view."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded. "Yes, I understand your point of view perfectly. That was not just uncomfortable, that was hell!" he exclaimed, shuddering in remembrance.</p><p><b></b>Now that Ranma seemed to have accepted the necessity Kasumi-otoko could see how determined Ranma was. And indeed, Ranma was thinking along the lines of <b>'If the girls and women of the world can do it, Ranma Saotome can do it too! I'll learn how to be a girl as a whole and I'll treat it as a challenge. And I'll win. After all, Ranma Saotome does not lose!' </b></p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group. I enjoy reading your comments, and the suggestions you all make will help to make this story even better.</p><p>If you find anything illogical that might have created a plot-hole or anything else that is wrong, let me know and I'll fix it.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
