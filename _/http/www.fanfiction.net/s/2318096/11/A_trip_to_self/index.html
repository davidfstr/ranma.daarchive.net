No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 11: A loon who went too far</b></p><p><b></b>The fastest way to get to the Nekohanten was over the rooftops. It was also the best way to ensure that none of them would get splashed before their journey had even started.</p><p><b></b>Ranma voiced his thoughts. "I know you mightn't like it, Kas-chan, but the fastest way to get to Cologne would be..." and he pointed up towards the rooftops.</p><p><b></b>"Oh my!" Kasumi exclaimed, once more pleasantly blushing at the pet name. Only good that Ranma could not see it in the dark, as they were shrouded in darkness by the shadows of the buildings around them. And luckily the full moon did not manage to illuminate the street they were standing in. Aside from the blush Kasumi´s heart was soaring at the prospect of being held in his strong arms while they would bound over the rooftops.</p><p><b></b>That it would probably be the most thrilling experience in her life up till now and that she would also be as safe in those arms as in a nuclear bunker surely had nothing to do with her accelerated heart-rate, no, absolutely not. "I will try it, Ranma-kun. I know I can trust you." she said, hiding her excitement in face of her introduction to roofhopping.</p><p><b></b>Her confident answer brought a pleased expression to Ranmas face, and Kasumi knew why. Her youngest sister had <i>never</i> trusted Ranma, and he had even killed a god for her. He had actually <i>killed</i> to save her, and which greater proof of trustworthiness could a human offer but that he was willing to kill for his loved ones in order to save them? And especially for someone as moral as Ranma this could only be seen as the greatest reason to trust him. Inwardly she could only shake her head at Akane's stupidity.</p><p><b></b>She remembered especially the one time when Akane had yelled "I'll never ever trust you! Perverts can not be trusted!" right into his face as a very vivid  had been a few weeks after the failed wedding, and the hurt look on his face had been enough to send Kasumi crying for hours. Kasumi knew that Akane had practically shattered his heart there and then, and she admired that Ranma had tried to fix things between them despite the deep wound in his heart and his own trust in Akane. The oldest Tendo sibling did not know if her sister had done it voluntarily or if she had only been indifferent towards Ranma's thoughts and feelings and had thought that Ranma would always be hers regardless of how much abuse she put him through.</p><p><b></b>Or maybe her little sister had just been too insensitive to recognise how much her actions, but especially her words, had hurt Ranma. Or the handsome martial artist had been nothing more than a possession for her that she had fought over with the other girls. Maybe Ranma had been nothing else but a trophy to be won by them. This was a thought that made her sick. No human being should be treated as a possession or a trophy. Period.</p><p><b></b>But all that did not matter any more. Despite all her attempts to help her younger sister, Akane had blown it royally and forever. Now <i>she</i>, Kasumi Tendo, would ensure that Ranma would find the happiness he so deserved. And she dearly hoped that he would find it with her.</p><p><b></b>Now Kasumi did not feel remorse any more on acting on her feelings towards Ranma and had already begun to. She had done everything she could to give Akane and Ranma a chance together, but it had obviously not been meant to be. Add to it that Akane had never appreciated what a fine catch she had had in Ranma. But <i>she</i>, Kasumi, knew, and she dearly hoped that they'd end up together. At the moment she was carefully optimistic due to the changes their relationship had undergone and was still undergoing, but as she never had had a real relationship in her life she was careful.</p><p><b></b>She was brought out of her musings when she noticed that Ranma had said something, and then he swept her softly into his arms with a smile. A super-human jump up to the rooftop of the adjacent house later and the run began. As he ran and hopped from rooftop to rooftop, he could not help but notice how Kasumi relaxed in his arms after the initial bout of excitement.</p><p><b></b>And he smiled. He now knew that she <i>really</i> trusted him, and it filled a void in his heart that he hadn't known had existed before. When Kasumi snuggled up to him he nearly felt his heart stop, but a second later he was relaxed and concentrated again. The feeling of her body snuggled up to him did not made him feel uncomfortable at all, because it felt so good, so right.</p><p><b></b>It had never been this way with Akane. Sure, his heart had always skipped a beat when she had smiled her cute smile at him, but that had been on so few occasions lately that he had almost forgotten what it looked like. And at even the hint of physical affection or contact Akane would have (and had) clobbered him into next week, in contrast to Kasumi who had apparently enjoyed their hugs, and that in both forms; something that would have been impossible with the perversity-fixated Akane. And Kasumi smiled often, and the smiles that she directed at him lately made him melt.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi had also never, never ever hit him for petty reasons like Akane had. Not that he remembered that Kasumi ever <i>had</i> hit him. Nor did she seem to think of him as a pervert. And she was kind, attractive, cute, selfless, intelligent, helpful, lovely... there were so many adjectives that described her. And how she smelled! Heavenly! <b>'Whoa, first what happened between us in the kitchen, and now this. Man, seems I got it bad. But with someone like Kasumi, that ain't bad...'</b></p><p><b></b>Ranma was shaken out of these nice thoughts rather violently by something he had hoped he wouldn't have to hear until he had returned to Nerima. And to be honest, even then he would have been glad to never hear it again. Out of the corner of his eyes he noticed her approach, and he redirected his jump just in time to avoid a collision. That she endangered Kasumi, an innocent person who had nearly no martial arts skill made his blood boil.</p><p><b></b>Nearly snarling at Kodachi he let Kasumi get to the ground; once the oldest Tendo stood on her own feet again she exclaimed an "Oh my!" at the demented expression on Kodachi's face. Kasumi knew (like the rest of the ward) that Kodachi had had increasingly severe mental problems ever since she and her brother had witnessed how their mother got killed by a gang when they were very young, but her current mental state could only be described as frighteningly insane. A quick glance at Ranma told her that he was even more surprised at the mental state Kodachi was in.</p><p><b></b>And truly, Ranma had never seen Kodachi so unhinged. It seemed as if she had suddenly decided that she wanted to win 'her' Ranma-sama at all costs now after the period of relative quiet lately. And Ranma was unsure how to handle this ready for anything Kodachi, for despite everything, he had still reservations to hurt her. All that he knew for sure was that he was angry at Kodachi for endangering Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>"OHOHOHOHOHOHO!" the target of Ranma's ire exclaimed. But Kodachi Kuno, who was now standing on the rooftop next to the one they were standing on, didn't notice his glare. She was obviously and as always too far gone in her own little dream-world to perceive anything correctly.</p><p><b></b>But apparently she was not so far gone that she hadn't noticed the woman who had been in the arms of her´ Ranma-sama. "You!" she exclaimed and pointed an accusing finger at Kasumi, "What were you peasant girl doing in the strong arms of my Ranma-sama? It is only <i>my</i> privilege to be in this position! For this insolence you will be punished!" she screamed and launched herself from the rooftop.</p><p><b></b>In mid-jump her ribbon lashed out, and Ranma was momentarily too shocked that Kodachi would dare to attack his sweet and innocent Kasumi. In his mind nobody would ever even think to attack Kasumi, thus he was vastly unprepared to defend her.</p><p><b></b>His surprise cost him valuable seconds, and thus he was far too late to catch the ribbon or to deflect it. Kodachis' sharp ribbon managed to connect and inflicted a deep cut in Kasumis' face, who yelped in pain. Startled and disbelieving Ranma looked at the woman he liked very much and whom he had sworn to protect, and his ire at Kodachi for first endangering Kasumi and now for attacking and hurting her grew into a cold rage. Any pity Ranma felt for her because of her desolate state was blown out of the  the look on his face as well as the low growl that escaped his throat served to make Kodachi stagger back in surprise, her eyes wide.</p><p><b></b>Ranma slipped into the Soul of Ice to control his raging emotions and reached into his pocket. He produced a clean blowrag and pressed it tenderly onto the wound to stop the bloodflow, while Kodachi watched, a look of confusion edged on her face. "Kas-chan, press this on the wound, okay?" he said, and his Kas-chan nodded bravely. With concern deeply edged on his face he asked her "Are you strong enough to sit on this mantelpiece over there?" while he seemed to ignore Kodachi, who watched the display in growing confusion.</p><p><b></b>Why was her Ranma-sama caring for this servant girl? It made no sense to her! But Ranma did not ignore Kodachi as he treated Kasumi, far from it. In truth Ranma had the confused Kodachi under constant surveillance, and now he was ready for everything she could dish  insane martial arts gymnast was currently busy making sense of the situation, and she was currently in the process of deciding on a course of action. It was well known that her Ranma-sama was the kindest and most caring person ever, but what she saw in his eyes was more than just care. Her crazy mind saw only one solution: she had to place herself in the position of the serving girl; she had to replace her, and that would only work by removing her from the equation. Permanently.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Kasumi nodded, and Ranma took the Tendo girl by the hand. Kasumi let herself be led to the mantelpiece where she sat down, still a bit white-faced from the unexpected attack. Satisfied that Kasumi was seated and had the opportunity to overcome the shock he cracked his knuckles. Now he really had had enough of Kodachi. He had tolerated her in the past because he had felt something akin to pity for the fate she had suffered, but now she had <i>really </i> gone too far. Nobody endangered and hurt his loved ones, and Kodachi would learn this lesson. Painfully if necessary.</p><p><b></b>The raven-haired teen surveyed his opponent with a cold glare. If she'd attack him like she usually did she'd be in for a big surprise this time. A surprise for which Kodachi would have to thank Kasumi and their talks. Kas-chan had driven home the point that there was nothing wrong with defending himself from an attack executed by a female.</p><p><b></b>And her arguments had been pretty darn convincing. For one, his father had only taught him the 'don't-hit-girls-routine' because in Genmas opinion, girls were weak and did not <i>deserve</i> to be fought like a male opponent. Kasumi had not needed much time to prove this particular teaching of Genma as completely wrong, and Ranma had relented when Kasumi had argued that she, Ranma, was anything but weak as a female.</p><p><b></b>And what about the other females, like her mother, or Akane, Ukyo, Shampoo and even Kodachi? They weren't weak either, nor were girls in general, so that Genma's position was pretty much shot. Ranma had nearly collapsed in helpless laughter when Kasumi has asked "And how do you think the panda would fare against Elder Cologne?". The mental image of his baka father getting the snot beaten out of him at the hands of Cologne had just been too funny. Maybe something like that could be arranged, and Ranma would love to watch the display as a female and taunt him but good.</p><p><b></b>But the killing blow to his conviction had been Kasumis argument that if one wanted to defeat Ranma, they had only to utilise his general refusal to hit females against him and sic a horde of female martial artists with sufficient skill on him. Sure, he was worldclass and nearly unequalled in power and skill, but due to the fact that he'd only dodge and not retaliate in kind he'd sooner or later be weakened enough to be defeated. And as running away from a fight like Genma would if it looked bleak (Saotome final technique: run away!) was not Ranmas style, he <i>would </i>lose or probably worse.</p><p><b></b>To his immense chagrin Ranma had not had a counter to this, and finally his conviction to not hit females regardless the circumstances had crumbled. Silently he thanked Kasumi for this talk. He still would <i>never</i> land the first blow or retaliate needlessly, but he would defend himself and end the fight, which also included hitting a female opponent. And Kodachi would be the first to get involved with this new and improved Ranma Saotome.</p><p><b></b>Ranma switched into a defensive stance and awaited the first move of Kodachi. And he was now more than ready to retaliate in kind. Apparently his anger had penetrated even her delusional perception, but as this view of her Ranma-sama did not fit into her perfect little dream-world she shook it off. Her Ranma-sama loved her, and she only had to dispose of this stupid peasant woman. Surely her Ranma-sama would thank her that she had freed him of this stupid Tendo girl. Then they would be united in love forever more!</p><p><b></b>With a bout of maniacal laughter she attacked, but not Ranma was her target. Once more her ribbon lashed out from her right hand with Kasumi as its target, and additionally she threw one of her spiked clubs aimed for Kasumis' head. Ranma steamed at her murderous actions and blurred from sight. He reappeared seconds later in front of Kasumi and caught the ribbon with one hand while he used the other to fire what he had dubbed the 'Panda flambé' and incinerated the spiked club in midair.</p><p><b></b>Then he turned a pair of blazing eyes on Kodachi, and the look in them was obviously enough to shake the insane gymnast down to the core. "I have finally had enough of ya, ya crazy nut case! I have tolerated yer actions in the past, but now yer've gone and attacked someone I like very much! And with the intent ta maim and kill ta boot! Are ya totally freakin' crazy, ya loon?" he yelled at her heatedly.</p><p><b></b>Kodachi had involuntarily stepped back. Her Ranma-sama was <i>yelling</i> at her! But why? She had only wanted to rid herself and him of an obstacle which prevented their perfect love. What was wrong with that? "But my Ranma-sama, why are you saying such things? I love you, and I would do everything for you! Including the removal of this peasant girl so that we can be together!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma steamed, and his control on the soul of ice slipped. And it showed in a fiery aura that engulfed him, which also illuminated the night. Flames seemed to dance over the body of Ranma, and fire glowed in his eyes. "I will repeat this once, and only once: I have <i>never</i> loved you nor <i>will</i> I ever love you! You are as crazy as a whole loony bin put together, and you are a danger to those around you! Heck, you tried to kill Kas-chan! Either you get lost now to never return, or I'll have to get angry! I don't wanna see ya ever again, got it?"</p><p><b></b>Even in face of a fiery glowing and very pissed Ranma Kodachi stood her ground. It can be argued that she's just too insane to feel fear, but anyway, she was far from giving up on her Ranma-sama. "I see the vile brown-haired harridan has bewitched you with a spell. Well, peasant girl, that leaves me no other choice but to kill you to free my Ranma-sama from your vile clutches. Now die!" she screamed and threw another ribbon at Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>This one was however vastly different from her standard ribbons, as it could be charged with electricity, which made it into a very dangerous and downright lethal weapon. And Kodachi <i>had</i> set it to a deadly discharge. Ranma, who had stood several feet away from where Kasumi was sitting blurred once more, and seconds later Kasumi and Ranma had disappeared from the rooftop.</p><p><b></b>Kodachi fumed that her attack had failed, and she searched the night  angrily. Her job was made somewhat easier by the full moon which illuminated the night, but even with the aid of the stellar body she was unsuccessful. Her Ranma-sama was gone. And indeed, Ranma had used his vastly improved speed to put some distance between them and Kodachi.</p><p><b></b>The Kuno girl was even crazier and more dangerous than usual, and he had underestimated her instability. His anger at himself for failing Kas-chan was suppressed for now, as he had to concentrate on getting Kasumi to safety. He 'd never risk Kasumis' life in the upcoming fight. One mile away from Kodachi he sat Kasumi softly on yet another (but probably safer) mantelpiece and smiled at her. "I'll soon be back, Kas-chan. But I can't let her run around unchecked, she's clearly gone over the edge. I gotta stop her."</p><p><b></b>The Tendo girl nodded and smiled back despite the pain in her cheek. "Just be careful, Ra-kun. I'll manage." she said.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed pleasantly at the pet name she had used for him, and then he nodded. With a wave at Kasumi and a smile he bound away, and instantly switched into battle-mode. He extended his ki- and aura-senses to lock in on Kodachi, and seconds later he had found her power-level. With some effort he switched into the soul of ice once more to calm his raging emotions; it would not do if he gave them free reign, for else he feared that he'd burn down something.</p><p><b></b>But how dare this crazy chick attack his Kas-chan! He'd always pitied Kodachi ever since he had learned of her grievous past, but that was no reason to run around and maim people! And had he not been as fast as he was Kodachi would have killed his Kas-chan! No, she had to be put out of commission, and the best course of action was to capture her and hand her to the authorities; which would hopefully commit her to an asylum where she could receive help.</p><p><b></b>Though first he got to catch her, which would be something in an on itself. Sure, he was several times stronger and much more powerful than Kodachi, but her insanity made the lunatic gymnast unpredictable and a danger to her surroundings. Ranma still did not understand how a lunatic like Kodachi had been allowed to run around unchecked like she had in the past.</p><p><b></b>Considering what she had done in the past it was more than surprising. Possession and use of illegal drugs and potions, toxic gasses and so on. The list of delicts was probably longer than his arm. But obviously the money and influence of her father, their loony principal, was enough to keep her from being committed. The pigtailed youth could only shake his head at the thought that the money and influence of the Kunos was enough to keep an entire ward in check. But right here and now he would do something to keep the woman he liked very much safe.</p><p><b></b>Ah, there she was, and she was apparently looking for him. Good, that she was distracted by searching for him without a pinpoint at his location could be used to his advantage. Smirking because of the spontaneous idea that had hit him he switched into the Umi-senken and became practically invisible. Instantly he put his stealth to full use and covered the distance which separated him from Kodachi in seconds without her noticing his approach. A heartbeat later she was relieved of the backpack she was wearing, and a surprised Kodachi whirled around.</p><p><b></b>She looked around frantically, but saw nothing at all. Meanwhile Ranma had strapped the backpack onto his own back, as it wouldn't be a hindrance at all. And depositing it somewhere was far too dangerous because of the probable contents. Ranma watched with amusement as Kodachi still continued to scan the night for the mysterious person that had stolen her backpack, and decided to have a bit of fun. Playing with the mind of Tatewaki had been fun, so why not play with Kodachis too before he'd catch her?</p><p><b></b>Cloaked by the Umi-senken he jumped onto the chimney. It would be <i>real</i> fun to play with her mind and scare her before he would reappear and catch her. But scare first, catch later. After what she had done to Kasumi she deserved a good scare and a lesson in fear, and psychological punishment in addition to potential physical punishment (should it be necessary) often worked better than just physical punishment alone. Kodachi had always liked to scare others with her behaviour, but now it was her turn to be the scared one.</p><p><b></b>With a smirk he prepared himself mentally and disguised his voice. "LITTLE GIRL, ARE YOU LOST?" he asked in a booming and semi-demonic voice which he had enhanced with his ki, like he had heard it on TV some time ago.</p><p><b></b>As predicted Kodachi whirled around, but couldn't see anyone. That the crazed martial arts gymnast was surprised and somewhat scared was obvious on her face. "Who… who is there? Show yourself, peasant!" she asked, trying to sound brave and commanding.</p><p><b></b>Ranma only laughed in an eerie imitation of demonic laughter. "YOU ASK WHO I AM, LITTLE GIRL? THAT… IS A SECRET!"</p><p><b></b>Kodachi lost her nerve and threw one of her gas-balls she was carrying on her belt at the suspected source of the laughter. Before it had any chance to hit him he had long bound away and landed behind Kodachi. "BOO!" he whispered into her ear, and this time Kodachi was <i>really</i> afraid.</p><p><b></b>She yelped and actually jumped onto the next rooftop to bring some distance between herself and the mysterious presence. If only her Ranma-sama was here, he would be able to help her against this vile nuisance! Her Ranma-sama was strong, and he'd safe her, she was sure.</p><p><b></b>Said Ranma decided that he'd had enough fun, and now it was time that the kids gloves came off. He'd scared her sufficiently, now he'd finish it. Mentally he congratulated himself to the plan he'd made up just now on the spot. Kodachi was now really scared and obviously believed that there was someone or something out to get her, if her stance with her club out and at the ready was any indication.</p><p><b></b>Now, if he appeared before her with some delay she'd surely want him to protect her. And if he'd refuse that in all clarity and deflect the attack which was sure to follow he could have a chance to make it absolutely clear that he held no love for her and never would. Maybe she'd finally get a hint, and if not he'd just drag her to the police and file charges. No one attacked Kas-chan and went unpunished!</p><p><b></b>Still cloaked he jumped over the rooftops to bring some distance between himself and Kodachi. After all, he needed enough of a start-up to make it believable. Then he dropped the Umi-senken and approached Kodachi, who was still standing on the rooftop adjacent to the one where the 'presence' had scared her. Ranma allowed his new powers to come out somewhat and formed a fiery aura with it so that the crazy girl would notice him.</p><p><b></b>And notice him she did, and her expression changed from fear to relief. "My Ranma-sama!" she exclaimed as he landed some feet away from her, "You have come to save me!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma displayed his most angry expression and scowled as he landed a few feet away from her. "What are you babbling about, you crazy chick? I have come to take you to the police for what you have done! How dare you attack my Kas-chan like that!" he growled out in an eerie imitation of Ryoga.</p><p><b></b>Kodachi was taken aback by his vehemence, but caught herself fast with the help of her delusions. After all, her Ranma-sama <i>could</i> not be angry at her, he loved her! "My Ranma-sama, there is someone here, and he's out to get me! You must save me, Ranma-sama!" she exclaimed and managed to look like the poster-girl of a damsel in distress.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist deepened his scowl. "Are you even crazier than usual? Here is no one aside from you and me! If there was, I would have sensed them. And it was very dangerous to leave your backpack lying around on one of the rooftops. Especially a backpack full of such dangerous stuff! And how can you dare to ask me to help you after what you have done! Get it through your thick skull: I DON'T LOVE YOU! And I never will, you loon. Especially not if you try to kill those I like! Now, will you come with me peaceably or do I have to use force?"</p><p><b></b>Said loon understood it completely wrong, or to word it appropriately, the Kodachi-logic-system perceived what Ranma had said as it wanted to perceive it. Ranma wanted her to come with him, and he wanted to use force! Yummy! That he had her backpack was completely ignored. "Of course, my Ranma-sama! I am all yours! I'll call us the limousine which will bring us to my mansion! Oh the joy! My Ranma-sama wants me!" she exclaimed with a manic giggle.</p><p><b></b>Ranma shook his head in distaste. "Are you outta your freakin' mind? O-oookay, stupid question. Listen, I want nothing from you and I don't want you. All I feel in face of your behaviour is deep revulsion. Understand? I DON'T WANT YOU AND I DON'T LOVE YOU! And I <i>never will</i>! Understood?" he finished angrily.</p><p><b></b>For a moment it seemed as if Ranma's vehemence and choice of words had finally penetrated the thick barrier Kodachi had erected between herself and reality, but only for a moment. Then the gymnast shook her head sadly. "I see I will have to take you into my tender-loving care to cure you of the influence of the brown-haired harridan. But fear not, my Ranma-sama, I will break whatever hold she has over you! Remember, I do this for you!" she exclaimed and threw a gas-ball at Ranma.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth had been prepared for anything and jumped up high into the air from where he somersaulted and landed with a flip in midair behind Kodachi. A second later the crazed girl was relieved of her waist-belt which contained the balls filled with paralysis and knock-out gas. Using his chestnut-fist-speed Ranma deposited the waist-belt into the backpack. "Okay, ya nut case, that's enuff! Surrender or ya won't like the consequences!"</p><p><b></b>Kodachi only laughed in answer. "OHOHOHOHOHOHO! How delicious! <i>You</i> would never hurt me, my Ranma-sama. But I'm afraid that <i>I</i> will be forced to subdue you so that I can help you. Don't worry, it won't hurt much." she said and attacked with her clubs.</p><p><b></b>From their fights in the past Ranma knew that these clubs were equipped with razor-sharp spikes which could be extended at the push of a button. Currently they <i>were</i> extended, and the spikes were most likely tipped with a poison that would probably induce unconsciousness. Using his speed Ranma dove under the attacks, used his right hand to support himself on the ground and went for a leg-sweep.</p><p><b></b>The insane gymnast seemed to have sensed it and jumped over Ranma's incoming legs, but Ranma was already in motion again and managed to snatch away the club she held in her left hand. The Saotome youth then jumped backwards and retracted the spikes into the club. Then he broke the handle over his knee and threw the destroyed club into a far-away corner of the roof.</p><p><b></b>However, Kodachi had still one club left and probably several in reserve. And despite her being insane she was still very intelligent. She surveyed her opponent, the man she wanted to 'save', with a calculating look, and her face showed wariness. "It seems as if the hold of the peasant girls spell on you is quite strong, my Ranma-sama. But don't worry, I'll break it." she exclaimed with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Her smile would have been cute had it not been smiled by an insane person, and thus it only served to cause Ranma severe distaste. Instantly Kodachi jumped forward and brought down the club, or at least she tried to do so, for her target was already gone. Ranma had executed a backflip and had thus jumped off of the three-story building. It was much easier to fight in the streets than on the rooftops, for down here he had no reason to be as careful as up there. Not that he was concerned for his own safety, but true to himself he was concerned for Kodachis' safety, even though she'd hurt Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>He landed smoothly on his feet and waited for Kodachi to follow him. Standing in the street Ranma thanked the Kami that it had not rained throughout the whole day. Which might have been a mistake, considering how mischievous the Kami can be. For seconds later a sudden downpour occurred, which naturally changed Ranma into a female. The change itself didn't bother Ranma, but once Kodachi saw her in female form she would probably react... badly.</p><p><b></b>And when Kodachi <i>had</i> landed in the street she <i>was</i> instantly incensed at the sight of the 'red-haired harridan' at a place where she suspected her Ranma-sama to be. "You!" she spat, "What have you done to my Ranma-sama? I know he was here just seconds ago! I saw him land in this street! What have you done to him?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma was hard pressed not to sigh at the stupidity of the Kunos in face of the curse. How could one have such a giant blind spot? "Nothing, you idiot! If you haven't comprehended it until now, there's apparently no hope for you. But for your sake I'll repeat it one more time: I <i>AM</i> RANMA! And I am sure as hell not <i>your</i> Ranma-sama! I am under a curse that changes me into a girl when I am hit by cold water! And look up, what do you see? Rain! And its even cold rain. So put two and two together!" she exclaimed angrily and at the end of her patience with the Kuno girl.</p><p><b></b>Kodachi, true to self, put two and two together and got five as a result. "You vile harridan! You have hidden my Ranma-sama so that you can have him to yourself! But that was the last time! Die!" she screamed and attacked with her spiked club raised.</p><p><b></b>The redhead shrugged. It would have been a true miracle if Kodachi had grasped the concept of the curse now, as she had had so many chances before. But now Ranma was really fed up. She wanted to get away from this town exactly for reasons like these, and here she was, in a fight. Time to end this and to get back to her Kas-chan.</p><p><b></b>Ranma evaded the (in her opinion) clumsy attack, kicked the club out of Kodachis hand with a lightning fast kick and rushed forward. Then she executed a punch-kick-roundhouse-kick-punch-combo, and Kodachi was not able to block the last punch. The pigtailed girl had put quite some strength behind her attacks, and the crazed gymnast impacted against a wall with enough force to drive the air out of her lungs.</p><p><b></b>Panting but not ready to give up Kodachi came to her feet. She had still some tricks up her sleeve, and she was willing to use them! Moments later a chakram was flying through the air (yes, Kodachi had watched Xena, Warrior Princess), but Kodachi got the surprise of her life when Ranma simply plucked it out of the air. Due to her speed and reflexes this had been no feat for her, and as she was pretty much convinced that the weapon was not poisoned (after all, Kodachi had to throw the thing without poisoning herself) she had deemed it unperilous for her.</p><p><b></b>Grinning Ranma attached the chakram to her own waistbelt, and suddenly she rushed forward. It seemed as if she was not touching the ground at all, and Kodachis' eyes widened in surprise at the speed of her opponent. The redhead rammed her right fist into the abdomen of the crazy girl, and gave her no time to recover. Subsequently she drove her knee into Kodachis ribs. The insane gymnast grunted in pain, but was not out of it yet. After all, she'd never lose to a simple and insolent commoner! Those creatures had to know their places, and the Black Rose would show them!</p><p><b></b>Kodachi had fallen back slightly after she had gathered her bearings and suddenly performed a roundhouse-kick which was aimed for Ranmas head. The kick however met only thin air as the redhead had fazed out of sight. Moments later she appeared behind Kodachi, and before the crazy girl could react a strong chop to the back of her head drove the Kuno girl face-first into the ground. But Kodachi was either too stupid or too far gone to notice when she couldn't win a fight. Snarling she got to her feet, and Ranma wondered where the girl got her energy from. Supposedly from her madness, she mused. Well, time for the big guns, then. It was already taking too long for her taste.</p><p><b></b>While Ranma prepared to knock the Kuno girl out for good Kodachi had had enough time to recover somewhat. And despite all the hits she had received Kodachi still found enough strength to attack first, but Ranma had her guard up and stopped the sloppy punch to her face. She simply caught the incoming fist and threw Kodachi over her shoulder with no apparent effort. Then she turned around like lightning and followed the throw with a quick kick across the face.</p><p><b></b>The insane girl grunted as she flew back from the throw, and this time Kodachi knew deep down that she was no match for the red-haired harridan. She had as recently as come to this conclusion and wanted to resort to her dirty tricks, when she suddenly felt a sharp pain in the jaw. Obviously the harlot had used her foul magic to attack her faster than she had been able to see! Then she felt a hard impact, and then… nothingness.</p><p><b></b>Ranma watched with something akin to pity as Kodachi impacted hard against yet another wall. The insane girl had left quite an impression in the stone and was now lying in a heap on the ground. Ranma knew what had made the girl into what she was now, but she had had to stop her. No one attacked the people she loved, and especially not her Kas-chan! With a sigh she walked towards Kodachi, and from her aura the pigtailed girl knew that her opponent was out cold but otherwise mostly okay. She then got down to one knee and examined the backpack she was wearing for material to tie Kodachi up with.</p><p><b></b>After all, it would not do if her cargo struggled while she was bounding over the rooftops. Rummaging through the backpack she found two pairs of ribbons, which were just perfect. A minute later Kodachi was tied up like a Christmas present and ready for transport. Ranma slung the unconscious girl over her shoulder and jumped up onto the next rooftop.</p><p><b></b>Then she locked in onto Kasumi's aura, which was now slightly different due to the gender-change, but still very much Kasumi. Inwardly she smiled at the thought of spending the next three or four months in the company of the other curse victim. And that all alone, without all the others! She had grown to like Kasumi very much, and if she had to be honest to herself she had to admit that she really more than liked Kasumi. How much more, only time would tell.</p><p><b></b>Two minutes later Ranma landed on the rooftop where Kasumi-otoko was waiting. He was still sitting on the mantelpiece, as the shower had been very brief. The blowrag was still pressed onto his cheek, but it did not look as if he was in pain. Which was always a good thing. "Hey Ka-kun, I'm back! And look what I brought with me!" she said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi was obviously very relieved that Ranma was okay, and he surveyed the tied-up Kodachi with distaste. He knew what had happened to Kodachi in her childhood, but that was neither reason nor justification to run around and threaten and maim people. "Good to see that you're okay. But I'd say you won't be able to carry both me and Kodachi, as that would screw your balance too much. However, we should get her to the police. She deserves to be arrested for what she did." he said.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded her head empathically. She was somewhat disgruntled at what Kasumi had said, but he was right. Her balance <i>would</i> be screwed. Thus, another solution had to be found. And after some thinking she found it. "Wait a sec… Kodachi said that she wanted to call the limousine. That means she has to have her mobile with her. Let's only hope that I didn't trash it during the fight…" she muttered and went to examine Kodachi.</p><p><b></b>After some rummaging through her pockets which did not bother her too much she finally found the mobile. And to their luck it was still intact. Ranma grinned like a maniac as she dialled and called the police. "Yes… police, this is Ránmā Saotome." she said, remembering that she should use the ID she had received earlier. "We, that is a friend and I, have been attacked by a girl. We managed to render her unconscious, but we wish to file charges for assault. Yes… could you come to the Takamera street? Yes… thank you very much!"</p><p><b></b>After she had ended the call she turned to Kasumi. "Everything went perfectly. They're on their way and should arrive in less than three minutes. They said the police station isn't far away from here." Ranma said with a smile. "How about I get us down?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded. "Fine with me."</p><p><b></b>Ranma then swept Kasumi-otoko in her arms and jumped down. Once more she landed swiftly and let Kasumi down to the ground. Then she smiled. "Be right back!" she exclaimed and jumped upwards once more.</p><p><b></b>Thirty seconds later she was back with Kodachi in her arms. The unconscious girl was leant against a house wall while Ranma and Kasumi-otoko waited for the police. "Wheew, finally some time to rest." she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko mirrored the smile while Ranma dropped the still unconscious Kodachi onto the ground. And the way it looked the girl would remain unconscious for quite some time still. "Yes, I know what you mean. And it really relieves me that you are okay, Ranma. I was worried."he said with a smile that somehow made Ranmas insides melt.</p><p><b></b>In former times Ranma would have answered with some macho-comment, but talking with Kasumi on a regular basis had shown her that the macho-façade was not needed around the oldest Tendo. Thus she only smiled. "Thanks for worrying, Ka-kun. But everything's okay. The fight was a bit rough, but only on her. And I can't believe that she still hasn't understood the curse! How can one be so… delusional?"</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded sadly. "It is sad to see what has become of her. I still remember her as a little girl, and she was so carefree and happy back then. But that all changed when he mother got killed, and she never received the help she would have needed. Hopefully her father won't be able to interfere with the authorities this time. She needs help, and she needs it badly."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "You're right. But I had to stop her. There was no other way."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko stepped forward and hugged Ranma to him. "I know, Ranma. You had to do what was right. Kodachi can't run around unchecked, as she's far too dangerous. Had you not been there she might have killed me. Thank you for saving me." he said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>The redhead blushed. "Aww, it was nothing. I mean, I did it gladly. But I'm so sorry that I wasn't able to stop her from hurting you. It's all my fault!" she said with obvious anger at herself.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko just smiled and embraced her closer. "No, it was not. It <i>is</i> a martial artists duty to protect the weak, but how should you have known that she would attack me? There was <i>no</i> way you could have, Ranma. Even you, as strong and fast as you are, you are only human. And if someone is at fault, then Kodachi. She knew exactly what she was doing when she attacked, and she hazarded the consequences of eventually killing me. You saved me from that fate, and I can't thank you enough." he said and gave her a peck on the cheek.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed and finally relented. Kasumi was right. It was Kodachis' fault in the first place, and she had saved Kasumi after all. More awkward moments and self-admonishment were prevented when the police finally arrived. Surprisingly they had done the sensible thing and had not announced their presence via their police patrol lights and the blaring horn. Two officers exited the vehicle and noted their statements down. After that was done the officers assured them that they would be notified should their statements be needed in court.</p><p><b></b>Together they carried the still unconscious Kodachi to their car and laid her onto the backseat. The officers bid them good bye and drove off. Both cursed individuals could not help themselves, they had the feeling that Kodachi Kuno would escape the whole affair unscathed. This suspicion was supported by the fact that the officers had been very lax with their witness accounts once they had heard the name Kuno. In fact, they had hardly noted down anything. Thus it seemed as if the money and influence of the Kuno family in this ward would achieve victory over justice once more.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed. She could really not comprehend how loons like the Kunos could be allowed a free reign only because of their money and influence. Who would be declared responsible should something really bad happen? What if Kodachi suddenly killed a girl that looked like her? What then? Something had to be done about the Kunos, but for the life of her, she had no idea what. If not even the authorities could or would put a stop to their activities...</p><p><b></b>Kasumi obviously shared her thoughts, for he looked very glum and introspective. Gathering her bearings she managed a smile. "How about we get to the Nekohanten now? That incident kept us long enough."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded in agreement. Surely Cologne was already waiting for them. "You're right. If you would, Miss Saotome?" he said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled back. "Of course, Mr. Tendo." she said and gathered him into her arms.</p><p><b></b>Had anyone watched this, they would probably have fallen over with laughter at the picture of a petite redheaded girl carrying a tall, brown-haired guy in her arms. Or been surprised as hell. Anyway, Ranma thought nothing of it and jumped up onto the next rooftop, from where she started towards the Nekohanten. Once more she noticed that Kasumi seemed to feel quite comfortable in his position, and she allowed herself a smile at the level of trust he had in her.</p><p><b></b>She shook herself out of her musings when she noticed that she had overshot the mark. Smiling sheepishly she hopped the few rooftops back to the Nekohanten and landed elegantly with her precious cargo cradled safely in her arms. A moment later she let Kasumi softly out of her arms and down to the ground once more.</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo sibling smiled. "That was wonderful, Ranma. Even with the Kodachi-incident." he exclaimed. "When can we do it <i>again</i>?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma nearly face-faulted, but caught herself in time and smiled. "Whenever you want to, Ka-kun."</p><p><b></b>Suddenly a cackle could be heard from the front door of the Nekohanten. "Exuding your charm, Ranma?" Cologne teased.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi both blushed and sputtered, which caused Cologne to cackle some more. "Don't mind my teasing, children. It's just one of the few sports an old woman has left. As you can see," she said and pointed to her backpack, which was twice as tall as she, "I am ready to go. The soap is stored in my personal stuff space, and I have left a note with instructions for Shampoo and Mousse. And Tendo Kasumi, would you join me inside for a few minutes, there are some things I would like to talk to you about."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi looked surprised at Ranma, who shrugged and gave him a smile. Nodding towards her and returning the smile the cursed Tendo followed the Elder inside the Nekohanten. Cologne closed the door behind him, and the two settled down into a booth. The backpacks had been placed on the floor. "As you know, Tendo Kasumi," the Elder began, "Ranma is as of now an ally of my tribe, and as such I will offer him/her the best possible assistance, and in proxy you too. I know what you are feeling for Ranma, but because the kisses have been cancelled you need not fear. Your care for Ranma is quite obvious, Tendo Kasumi, and because of this you should know some things about Jusenkyo curses so you will be able to help Ranma once she changes into a girl for three or more months."</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo sibling had been surprised at first that the Elder had known of his feelings, as he had thought that he had hidden them well. But apparently that had not been the case. Well, as Cologne had said, there was no need for worry any more. "That would be most helpful, Elder. You are right, I do care a lot for Ranma, and I think I even love him, her too. Though I do not understand some of the reactions of my cursed form. But maybe your explanations will help. And please, call me Kasumi."</p><p><b></b>Cologne smiled, which was once more no nice sight. But it was the intention that counted. "Gladly, Kasumi. And you may call me Cologne. Being called Elder all the time makes me feel older than I already am, and that is more than old enough. But I am getting off track. The first thing you should know about Jusenkyo curses is, that the transformational magic of the Springs uses the genetic make-up of the victim to bring it into the form it would have had had it been born this way. In fact, Ranma does not look the girl who drowned in the Spring originally more than 1500 years ago."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi was now quite surprised. "You mean to say that Ranma in female form and I in male form look like we would have looked had we been born this way? And that our genes in these forms are our own and not those of the persons that drowned originally in there?"</p><p><b></b>Elder Cologne nodded. "Yes, Kasumi. The being or person that has drowned in a spring originally only serves as a kind of marker and serves to define the basics like the gender in case of gender-changing curses like that Ranma and you acquired or the species in case of animal or more esoteric curses. The rest is provided by the DNA of the victim. <i>This</i> is the reason why Ranma looks so much like her mother in female form, as she obviously inherited a lot of her mothers' genes. And you should thank the Kami for this in my opinion." she added with a cackle. "The curse also contains something akin to a brief manual on how to handle the cursed body. That's also why Mousse has the ability of flight or why my great-granddaughter lands on her paws when falling down as a cat." she explained.</p><p><b></b>The younger woman-turned-man nodded. "I understand, Elder. And it is really a good thing that Ranma inherited a lot from her mothers' side. I shudder to imagine a Ranma with more resemblance to Genma."</p><p><b></b>The matriarch actually shuddered and nodded. "That is exactly what I thought. Genma Saotome is an all around worthless male, and it is a good thing that Ranma seems to take after Saotome Nodoka in a lot of areas. But alas, we're getting off track again. There are still a lot of things that you should know, and I am sure that Ranma is getting impatient already. Thus I will hurry up."</p><p><b></b>She took in a deep breath. "Kasumi, we from the Joketsuzoku have a lot of experience with gender changing curses. Over the time we have lived near Jusenkyo several of our warriors fell into the Spring of Drowned Man. Be it due to challenges or simple accidents. And aside from the obvious physical differences pertaining the genders there are also other, internal differences."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded. "I know where you are getting at, Elder. As you might know, I am well versed regarding medicine, so I know that the hormonal levels are one of the differences you meant."</p><p><b></b>The old matriarch nodded impressed. Not many managed to surprise her, but there was apparently a lot more depth to the character of Tendo Kasumi than she would have thought. Slowly it dawned on her that they probably would have been in for a lot more trouble had Tendo Kasumi been the one Ranma had originally been engaged to. "Yes, this is one of the differences. You, Tendo Kasumi, will have to be very careful with the male hormones of your cursed form. It will take at least a month, maybe even longer, until the hormonal levels of your cursed form have approached a normal level. Due to that is also very wise to stay in your male form. Would you constantly change between forms it would complicate the adaptation process greatly."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded. "I thought as much, Elder. And as the hormonal levels are controlled by the brain, there is the other major difference. It is known that the male brain is differently structured than the female, and the brain chemistry is quite different too. As you noticed, I read about it in my books."</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded again, once more impressed. Yes, Tendo Kasumi was a lot more intelligent than she let on. "Correct, child. And to which consequences will this lead once you stay in your other form, Kasumi?"</p><p><b></b>The younger man thought for a moment to gather his bearings before answering. "The male brain of my other form denotes that I will have a different brain chemistry and a different brain structure. This means that the hormonal levels will be very imbalanced at first, which I already noticed during the times I was in my cursed form. I suppose that due to the fact, that evolution has hardwired several responses into the male brain, I will over time react more and more like a male would to stimuli." he concluded.</p><p><b></b>The matriarch nodded again. "Correct again, child. Over time you will act and behave like any man would. The speech patterns will become different, the way you handle things and so much more. But there is no reason to fear that you might turn into a male in mind, child. For there is another and very important part of a person which defines what a person is: the personality. And the personality is stored in some kind of secondary brain. Some races call it the 'spiritual brain'. It contains the personality, the part of a person which will remain unchanged regardless which gender the person has."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi looked thoughtful, then he nodded as he remembered something. "Yes, I have read of this too. But I also remember that the 'personality storage' can be influenced by the primary brain to some extent. It is like with computers, where the RAM, the secondary brain, influences the harddrive, the primary brain. And there are some cases in medicine were the primary brain is being influenced by the secondary. Amnesia is a good example for this."</p><p><b></b>Cologne agreed, obviously impressed by both the analogy and the example Kasumi had chosen. "You are correct. But in most cases of the more common temporary Amnesia is reversible, and the fact remains that you won't change in mind unless what you mentioned happens. So you need not fear to become a man in mind, as little as Ranma has to fear to become completely female. You two can get used to your cursed bodies without ruffle or excitement and find a balance between your two halves. Tell this to son-in… Ranma when you deem that the time is right."</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo child nodded. "I will, Cologne. And thank you for telling me this. It was most informative."</p><p><b></b>The Joketsuzoku nodded. "You are welcome, child. But now we should hit the road, as the people say. Ranma is surely getting impatient by now. But before we leave I suppose that you too will want to change back, eh? The odd downpour or what has happened? And let me get some herbs for that nasty cut you got there. I won't ask how you received it, you can tell me later."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded once more. "That would be nice, Cologne. I will go and get Ranma. She will surely want to change back too."</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded, got up and pogoed towards the cupboard where she kept her herbs. "You do that. I will prepare the herbs."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded and got up himself. He then went outside to fetch Ranma, and was not surprised that she had busied herself in the meantime. To keep herself occupied she was doing vertical push-ups on one finger. But she had a decidedly bored expression on his face.</p><p><b></b>That changed however when she noticed Kasumi, and in one smooth motion she jumped from her one-fingered handstand to her feet. "Hey Ka-kun, ready to go?" she asked with a grin.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled back. "Not right away, Ranma. Elder Cologne is preparing an herbal compress for the cut, and she offered us that we could change back if we want. What do you say?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma thought for a moment, then she nodded. "Roof-hopping is somewhat easier in my birthform, as I have a greater reach. Okay, let's do it!" she exclaimed and walked inside.</p><p><b></b>Two gender-changes and an herbal compress later the three were ready to leave. After Cologne had applied the herbal compress to the wound the old woman pogoed over to another table where a huge backpack stood. Effortlessly she strapped it to her back, and led the way to the door. Together the three exited the Nekohanten and Cologne locked the door.</p><p><b></b>Once they were outside Cologne clapped her hands. "Children, my suggestion is we head towards a secluded training ground I know of. It is ideal for the Bakusai Tenketsu training, as I have stored all necessary materials there. It would be best if we took to the rooftops, this way we'd be able to move much faster."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded. Then he grinned at Kasumi. "I guess you just got your next run over the rooftops. And earlier than anticipated, eh, Kas-chan?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi grinned back. "That's just fine with me." she said and jumped into Ranma's arms.</p><p><b></b>If Ranma was surprised by this he did not show it when he caught her effortlessly. What he did show however was a pleased smile. Kasumi had once more demonstrated her trust in him, and it felt good. "Hold on tight." he said. Kasumi did, and as she did so she snuggled up into his chest, which brought another, even more pleased smile to Ranma's face.</p><p><b></b>When he was sure that everything was a go for launch, Ranma jumped up onto the next rooftop. Cologne, who had watched the byplay between Kasumi and Ranma shook her head and smiled. <b>'Younglings. They should stop to dance around one another and come to the point.' </b>the Elder thought.<b> 'What they feel for each other is as obvious as saying 'the sun is hot'.</b> <b>But considering Ranma's history it is not surprising that he tries to take it slow. Although he is a lot more forward than he ever was with Tendo Akane.' </b>As an afterthought she mentally added,<b> 'You deserve happiness, Ranma. My bad that it took me so long to realise it.'</b></p><p><b></b>A voice shook her out of her musings. "You comin', Cologne?" Ranma asked from above.</p><p><b></b>Colognes' answer was to use her staff to catapult herself onto the rooftop and beside Ranma. "You were saying?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned, and a second later the run above the rooftops was on. Kasumi felt the wind pass by fast as they rushed past the houses beneath them, and it was a really thrilling way to travel. And how fast Ranma was! She nearly squealed with joy. Sometimes she could only see blurs as they rushed through the night, so fast were they.</p><p><b></b>Luckily it was a full moon, which made roofhopping by night a lot easier. Even though they were travelling at a ridiculous speed and were high above the ground, Kasumi never felt any fear. In the arms of Ranma she felt safe and protected, and a part of her wished that she could stay within these arms forever.</p><p><b></b>She sighed contently, and Ranma smiled down at her for a brief second. There was something about his smile that made her knees turn into jelly, and she was glad that she currently was in the position she was in.</p><p><b></b>Cologne followed Ranma and his precious cargo close in, and she noticed how closely the oldest Tendo daughter had snuggled into Ranma's chest. This display screamed 'I love you' with a megaphone and rock-concert speakers, and not for the first time lately the Elder of the Joketsuzoku mentally congratulated herself for taking the course she had.</p><p><b></b>Had she insisted on pursuing Ranma even after all what had happened, disaster might have befallen them. For Cologne had noticed the increasing depression Ranma had been developing before everything had been blown by Tendo Akane. A depression that had approached the levels she had before only seen in the Hibiki boy.</p><p><b></b>She shuddered to think what might have happened if Ranma had lost control of him/herself had she added pressure of her own on Ranma. The Elder doubted that anyone would have been able to stop him or her, not after the stunning and downright frightening display of power the female Ranma had given.</p><p><b></b>Cologne had not exaggerated when she had written to her fellow Elder Dou Ve that even <i>she</i> had been frightened. Truth be told, she had been shaken to the core. <i>Never</i> would she have imagined that so much power could exist, and in a single person no less. But gladly everything had turned out for the better, and Cologne thanked her ancestors for it.</p><p><b></b>Five minutes later Ranma, with Kasumi in his arms, and Cologne landed outside the city limits. "Now you gotta guide us, Cologne." the pigtailed martial artist said.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded. "Our destination is thirty-three miles to the north-west. The Mlao planes, a secluded area perfectly suited for what we have planned."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. He hadn't heard of them, but knowing Cologne that was not surprising. Trust the Elder to find a secluded territory even in a foreign country. "How good are ya at runnin', old ghoul? For that is what we gotta do."</p><p><b></b>"Ranma, watch your language!" scolded Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist looked adequately sheepish. "Sorry, Cologne. Force of habit."</p><p><b></b>The Elder grinned. "I can certainly relate, son-in... Ranma." she cackled. "That one was voluntarily. You got me curious however. I always wanted to know why you called me old ghoul, and now you just suddenly you stopped. Why?"</p><p><b></b>Now it was Ranma's turn to grin. "You know, it kinda annoyed me that ya always called me son-in-law. That really grated on me nerves. Thus I decided to pay ya back by calling ya that. Now that ya stopped calling me son-in-law I stopped callin' ya the name. Though it's hard ta stop, I gotta admit. Force o' habit, as ya said."</p><p><b></b>Cologne was surprised, but at the same time amused. Trust Ranma to do something like that. And she had to admit, the nickname <i>had</i> annoyed her. In the beginning at least.</p><p><b></b>There and then she had tried to punish a mere male for showing disrespect towards her, but she had fast learned that being treated like that was par for the course when dealing with Ranma and could not be changed.</p><p><b></b>Apparently she had been wrong, gauging from the amount of influence Tendo Kasumi seemed to have on Ranma. All it would have needed with Ranma had apparently been positive influence.</p><p><b></b>Not surprising considering that he had had enough bad influence to last him a lifetime. <b>'And it seems that Tendo Kasumi did just that, exert a positive influence on Ranma. Thus she has won where all the others failed. My felicitations, Tendo Kasumi.'</b> the Elder thought.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded to herself. Ranma did deserve happiness, and apparently he would find it with Tendo Kasumi. Now she, Head Matriarch Cologne of the Joketsuzoku, would do everything in her might to ensure that Ranma could protect Tendo Kasumi as best as possible. For with their curses, they were sure to attract chaos like lemonade a colony of ants.</p><p><b></b>Granted, the pigtailed martial artist was probably among the strongest on the planet now, but there was still room for improvement. Time to start the training on the Breaking point technique. And she would train Ranma in <i>both</i> forms. "To answer your question, Ranma, I'm not as good on my feet as I used to be. Had we to travel by foot, I would probably hinder our progress."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked. "Not a problem, Cologne. Get a hold on my back. And I'll carry you in my arms, Kasumi. This would be the fastest way."</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded and Kasumi smiled at the prospect to be in Ranma's arms again. Seconds later Cologne had attached herself to Ranma's back, and Ranma had swept Kasumi in his arms. The Elder noted for the first time that Ranma had grown a few inches and had filled out quite nicely. Naturally, all muscles. Add to it that Ranma's shoulders had broadened and you had a man that would make any dame swoon.</p><p><b></b>Ranma Saotome was indeed becoming a man. This was also emphasised by the fact that he underwent this training trip to find him/herself with only Tendo Kasumi as company. And if everything went as planned, Ranma would become a woman soon. Cologne expected that she would also hit a growth-spurt if only she stayed long enough in female form. Which she would.</p><p><b></b>From what she had seen of Ranma's mother Nodoka, Ranma's female form had inherited a lot of her mothers' genes, gladly for the girl. Cologne got nightmares from imagining Ranma with Genma's facial features. Bleagh! <b><br/></b>It was a little known fact that the transformational magic of the Springs used the genetic make-up of the victim to bring it into the form it would have had had it been born this way.</p><p><b></b>The being or person that had drowned in this spring originally only served as a kind of marker and served to define the basics like the gender (in case of gender-changing curses) or the species (in case of animal or more esoteric curses). The rest was provided via the DNA of the victim.</p><p><b></b>Yes, Ranma would fill out quite nicely once she'd hit her growth-spurt. Supposedly she'd have to beat the boys off of her with a stick once she had blossomed into full womanhood.</p><p><b></b>Cologne cackled silently to herself. She knew that when reports of boys starting to fly for mysterious reasons came in Ranma would have become a  to Colognes´ internal musings, the cursed martial artist smiled at Kasumi and off they were.</p><p><b></b>The training ground was really secluded and really hard to find, but with the directions he'd received from Cologne it had been easy. What had not been anticipated by Ranma had been the downpour that had occurred when they were five miles away from their destination.</p><p><b></b>It was only good that it was night, else it would have really looked weird to see a relatively short, buxom and extremely beautiful red-headed girl carrying a tall, brown-haired man in her arms and something that looked like a troll on her back. But as said, as it was night and the full moon was barely visible behind thick clouds nobody saw the strange trio, which was quite alright in Ranma's book.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko was quite surprised at the reaction that occurred after the change had been complete. He suspected strongly that it had something to do with raging and still very much unbalanced male hormones, but upon finding his male self in the strong arms of and in close proximity to a very attractive girl his body had reacted instinctively. Also Kasumi-otoko was very glad that it was night and nobody saw, for the bulge in his pants was quite noticeable and made him blush. The knowledge that it was a natural physical reaction for a male, which Kasumi presently was, would have done little to reassure him.</p><p><b></b>From her position on Ranma s back Cologne had not noticed, and Ranma had apparently fixated her view on the way ahead. Good! He would have never lived it down if either of them had noticed. Luckily the bulge receded after some time, but some strange pressure remained. Was that male arousal? <b>'Must be.'</b> Kasumi-otoko mused, '<b>But it felt so different compared to what I feel as a woman. Not in a bad way, though. Only the pressure is irritating.'</b></p><p><b></b>Unbeknownst to Kasumi Ranma had also had a surprising reaction. Upon suddenly feeling a firmly muscled and good smelling male pressed into her breasts her body had reacted and her nipples had suddenly become hard. In contrast to the times when the annoying old lech Happosai had tried to grope a feel, this had really felt good. She had also felt a strange tingling sensation in her lower abdomen of which she had no idea what it was. This was all so confusing to her! Maybe that had something to do with what her mother had mentioned in their talk, she mused embarrassed.</p><p><b></b>She was only glad that Kasumi-otoko had apparently not noticed her reaction. <i>Had</i> he noticed she would never have lived it down. But luckily he seemed to be somewhat distracted by something. Ranma could not quite describe it, but on an unconscious level she knew that she was attracted to Kasumi-otoko. There was this strange feeling as if a horde of butterflies were flying through her stomach accompanied with the feeling of something warm and wet between her legs.</p><p><b></b>Concentrating on what lay ahead Ranma banished those thoughts from her mind. Five minutes later they arrived at their destination, and the three pitched up their tents without saying much. It was far too late to start on the training, and truth be told, Ranma felt quite exhausted from the happenings of the day.</p><p><b></b>And what a day it had been! Little did Ranma know now, but this day was a turning point for him/her. And several years later Ranma Saotome would still look back on this day with fondness. Shortly afterwards Kasumi-otoko, Ranma and Cologne went to their respective tents and called it a night. Soon peaceful snores could be heard, and everything was quiet.</p><p><b></b>The next day started out much like the last had. It was once more a beautiful spring day, neither too warm nor too cold. Just the right conditions to start a very exhaustive training. Ranma had woken up early, filled with anticipation of what was to come. Ever since she had seen Ryoga use it for the first time she had wanted to learn the Bakusai Tenketsu. Badly. And now was finally her chance.</p><p><b></b>She liked her lips in anticipation and worked the zipper of the tent. The backpack she left here, as it contained nothing that could be of use to her today. When she exited the tent she noticed that Cologne was already up. It seemed like she did an Amazon version of morning exercises, for whatever it was, it looked pretty intense.</p><p><b></b>"Good morning, Ranma." Cologne called out, and Ranma returned the greeting. She looked around, but did not see Kasumi. Hmm, obviously he was still asleep.</p><p><b></b>As they had had no hot water available, they had had to stay in their cursed, no, Ranma corrected herself, alternate forms. Ranma really wanted to accept the curse, and had decided to think of her cursed form as something other than a cursed being, namely an alternate form of Ranma Saotome.</p><p><b></b>"I'm ready, Elder. Only gotta heat me some water, and then we can begin." Ranma enthused.</p><p><b></b>Cologne grinned. "There's no need for this, Ranma-chan." she said, pronouncing the chan. "I want to train you in <i>both</i> of your forms. I don't know how much will carry over if you were only trained as a male. Know that your female side needs as much training as your male side, for it will be with you for the rest of your life. You will always be half-girl, Ranma. And what would you do if you were not trained as good as a female as you are as a male and you had to fight an opponent as strong or stronger than your female half? Get hot water and change back? Unlikely during a fight. So take my advice, child, and train your female body as much as you can. Neglecting it might cost you dearly in the future."</p><p><b></b>Ranma raised a hand to her chin and thought for a moment about what Cologne had said. There was no way around it. What Cologne had said made perfect sense. If she neglected her female self and got into a fight with an opponent as good as her or even superior, she would very likely not get the time to change back.</p><p><b></b>And what if her opponent found out that the only thing he/she had to do was to splash her male half with cold water to gain an advantage? Truth be told, that was something she had never really considered until now.</p><p><b></b>No, Cologne was right. From now on she would train her female body as vigorously as her male body. Maybe even more, for she had to catch up with her male half quickly. Sure, even when female she was supposedly now one of the strongest in the world, but who knew who or what lurked out there?</p><p><b></b>Finally she voiced her decision. "I see your point, Elder Cologne. If you will, I would like to start the training as soon as possible."</p><p><b></b>Cologne smiled at Ranma s decision. It was the right one, for it was the <i>only one</i>. "Good, child. You see this area over there?" she asked and pointed towards a plain. Ranma nodded. "Good. There we will train."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded in eager anticipation, just when Kasumi-otoko emerged from the tent. Ranma gave him a smile, unbeknownst to her how dazzling it was and waved a "Good morning!" at Kasumi-otoko.</p><p><b></b>Said cursed individual was momentarily at a loss of words due to said smile. It took him several tries to re-establish enough higher brain functions to stutter a "Good morning!" back.</p><p><b></b>"We will now start the training in the Breaking Point technique. Cologne made me see that it would be good to learn it in both forms. Do you wanna come with us?" Ranma asked.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded promptly. "Oh my, I would like that."</p><p><b></b>That caused Ranma to wiggle a finger at him. "What did I tell you about saying 'Oh my' when a guy, Kasumi? Or should I call you Yoshiro?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko looked sheepish. "Sorry, Ranma. As for calling my male form Yoshiro, please start this once we are locked. Ne, Ránmā?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed. And Cologne cackled. "Touché, I'd say. But what is this about calling Kasumi's male form Yoshiro? You got me curious, Ranma-chan." the Elder said, using the female suffix voluntarily. Ah, it was too funny how easily Ranma could be teased!</p><p><b></b>Blush deepening, Ranma answered. "We had to come up with names for our cursed forms. With Nabiki's help we got ourselves ID-cards with adjusted maintenance histories for them, and I chose to use the name Ránmā Saotome, for obvious reasons. I just hate the name Ranko and would never choose that as my name! And Kasumi chose the name Yoshiro Tendo. You know, Yoshiro means 'free son' in our language. And cause of the curse that is what Kasumi is now. Free."</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded. "I see. Quite creative, I admit. But enough talk. We got a long day ahead of us. <i>You</i> most of all, Ranma . The sooner we get started the sooner it will be over."</p><p><b></b>That did not sound exactly reassuring to Ranma. But she wanted to learn the Bakusai Tenketsu. And if Ryoga had managed to do so, she would too. However, Kasumi could not suppress his worries when he learned of what was involved in the Bakusai Tenketsu training. "Elder, do I gather it right that boulders will be thrown at Ranma until she has toughened up enough to become impervious to their impact?"</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded in answer. "Yes, child. But there is a bit more to it still." she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded. "But what about Ranmas breasts? As you surely know, the breasts are the most sensitive parts of a woman's body. Won't it be very hurtful for Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>Even Ranma looked somewhat worried, as even she knew how sensitive her breasts were. "Ain't there some technique that can help?"</p><p><b></b>Elder Cologne smirked. If her smile was bad enough to scare away most normal humans, her smirk was enough to make even the most battle-hardened Musk warriors run away in abject terror. "Yes, there is. And you already have all the prerequisites that are needed. During the training you only need to concentrate your ki into your breasts to harden them from the inside until the outside has been toughened up enough by the procedure. This is what we would have done anyway, Ranma. This is what my tribe has done ever since we developed the technique."</p><p><b></b>Both Ranma and Kasumi looked relieved. And with that the training began. Ranma spent hours upon hours peeling herself off of boulders. As she nearly had the technique down already, the toughening part of the training was the most important part. But it was also the most hurtful part...</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
