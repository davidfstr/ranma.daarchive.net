No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 25</b></p><p><b>Interlude: Floating</b></p><p><b></b>She… no, he was feeling very strange. Even in this place – whatever it was – he had apparently taken the gender he was currently in with him. Not that he cared much, he had nearly gotten so used to his new body that it nearly didn't matter to him any more; that was very much due to the person he loved, his Ranma.</p><p><b></b>He had no idea where he was, for absolutely no sounds could be heard, not even his own heartbeat or breath. That in and on itself was very strange. For a lack of better description it felt as if he was immersed in the deep water of a lake or ocean, but instead of drowning he was floating gently.</p><p><b></b>Instinctively he knew that he could not be immersed in a watery body, because for one he did not seem to need oxygen for his lungs weren't burning; and for another he felt absolutely dry. He also had the instinctive knowledge that no harm could befall him here, wherever here was.</p><p><b></b>His memory was very hazy but he remembered that he had tried to save Ranma from something terrible. He had acted on instinct, an instinct he had not even known he possessed but still threw himself in harms way. Then he had known no more. But had he succeeded? Had he saved Ranma?</p><p><b></b>He opened his eyes and looked around to gather his bearings, but in whichever direction he looked, the only thing he saw was a wall of endless white, totally formless, totally shapeless. It was unnerving and raised a suspicion. <b>'Am I dead?'</b> he asked himself.</p><p><b></b>/ "Damn he's in a right state! Put him on the bio bed!" someone exclaimed. /</p><p><b></b>He winced at the sudden onslaught of unexpected noise. That had sounded very much like someone he knew or should have known but he could not be sure who it was nor could he place what was going on. It had been very brief and suddenly he was back in the noiseless white place. What had happened? Then he was yanked back to… wherever once more.</p><p><b></b>/ "Ya. He took the full brunt of the blast when he shielded Ranma. Pretty darn brave. Will he make it?" asked another voice, apparently worried.</p><p><b></b>"Can't say as of yet. It has been a while since one of you was this gravely injured. He has lost a lot of blood and…" /</p><p><b></b>Kasumi or rather Yoshiro suddenly knew to whom those voices belonged. Lil' Washu and Ryoko. And then he remembered… at least partially. The energy blast fired upon Ranma by this insanely strong Android. His jump in front of her. Immense, unbearable pain. Then… nothing.</p><p><b></b>He wanted to cry out from all the pain he was feeling but somehow that was not possible. Something was hindering him, dragging him away from the pain, immersing him back into the non-water, dulling the pain; and suddenly every feeling of pain was gone once more and he closed his eyes again and relaxed into the currents of the non-water.</p><p><b></b>He had the feeling that he was floating again but this time he had the distinct feeling that he was heading somewhere, to a specific place. How he knew he had no idea. He knew that he was not in hell, for surely it was one hell of a lot warmer down there.</p><p><b></b>As he had no way of finding out where he was and where he was inadvertedly heading he relaxed and let the mysterious currents that were at work here carry him to the place where he was meant to be. It seemed as if he could do nothing anyway and thus he opted to ride it out and closed his eyes.</p><p><b></b>All of a sudden and seemingly no time at all later his 'transport' stopped and the accompanying feeling of floating faded too. Not really sure of what to do he opened his eyes only to look into a face he had not expected to see again till the day he died. She looked like he liked to remember her, as beautiful as an angel. But that could not be, could it? "M… mom?" he managed to ask as he got to his feet and the smiling woman nodded.</p><p><b></b>It was all he could do not to pass out but apparently passing out was impossible in this place. "B… but how? Oh, I'm really dead, huh?"</p><p><b></b>Kimiko Tendo smiled, a smile that he only remembered too well, a smile he had missed so much. "It's understandable that you might think so, my child, but no, you are <i>not</i> dead; though you came very close. And you won't die, even though it looks very bleak right now. But everything will be alright soon again. Now let me have a good look at the son I never had." she said with a mischievous smile as she circled him.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly it dawned on him. "You know? You really know everything that has happened lately?" he asked incredulously.</p><p><b></b>His mother nodded. "That and much more, my child. I have watched all of you ever since I died. Yes, I know everything. And although I am not happy with many things that have happened in the eleven years that I have been dead I am very happy with how things are turning out now. Tell your father that I am very proud that he has decided to live again and tell him to continue on his path." she said with a smile; a smile that Yoshiro mirrored. "And tell him if he ever falls into this depression again I'm going to possess Nodoka and teach him a lesson he is likely to never forget." she stated.</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro nodded. He too was very proud of his father and hoped dearly that he would never become the weakling he had been for the last ten years ever again. Maybe this threat could help in preventing a relapse. "I will mom." he said. Then his face took on a curious expression. "Say, did Akane really see you when she had died at Jusendo?"</p><p><b></b>Kimiko Tendo nodded. "That she did, my child. However, your sister had really died and it was Ranma that brought her back. And I am so sad about what happened afterwards. Ranma really loved her very much and to see how my little A-chan destroyed her own happiness bit by bit drove me to tears. Her anger was always her greatest enemy and it won in the end as it destroyed the love Ranma felt for my little daughter. And poor Ranma… after all that this poor soul had gone through he/she did not deserve this. But don't you dwell on it, my child. What happened was for the better. Even that you received your curse serves a deeper sense. And you make a very good boy, my child. I'm proud that you're adjusting so well. And the name you chose for your male side, Yoshiro, fits you very well."</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro smiled a chagrined smile. "Thanks, mom. In the beginning it was so strange to suddenly have body-parts that I never thought I would have. I had to get used to so much and had it not been for Ranma I think I would have gone crazy. But believe it or not, even though <i>she</i>, now that we're locked I refer to Ranma as a girl, and what a beautiful girl she makes…" he said with a smile before he caught himself and blushed.</p><p><b></b>His mother smiled in understanding. "I know what you're thinking, dear. You think that you'd never have thought that you'd think something like that about another girl. But you and Ranma are unique for you are both; both woman and man. Both of you said it before and its true: you two are the perfect couple and I'm so happy for the two of you." she said and Yoshiro knew that his mother meant this from the bottom of her heart. "And no I can't read minds. Even death won't do that to you." she said with humour. "It was just something that was obvious."</p><p><b></b>Unconsciously smiling he nodded. "Just looking at her makes me want to hold her and never let go." he said with a sigh. "And when <i>he</i> holds me, my female side that is, I feel so safe and protected. It's really as if we were meant to be this way. But Ranma… she's incredible. Even though she has not accepted the curse fully as of yet she has helped me cope. Immensely. Without her I'd never have managed." he said with a real smile. "And now I'm so happy that I can help her. Deep in my heart I know that everything happened for a reason. But it broke my heart every time I saw Ranma hurt; and in the beginning it seemed that I could do nothing to ease his/her pain. I could only watch and tend to the many wounds, both physically and mentally. Mom, I felt so powerless. You have no idea how often I cried because of the unfairness of it all." he said and looked at his empathising mother. "Or maybe you do." he added with a slight smile.</p><p><b></b>His mother nodded. "I watched everything, my child. Ranma is an exceptional person and I'm glad that you managed to show her that she can rely on you if she needs reassurance or protection. Or everything else for that matter." she said with a slight smile before getting earnest again. "No one should be made to rely just on him- or herself or they'll starve emotionally. And that's one of the worst fates." she said with conviction and Yoshiro nodded empathically.</p><p><b></b>Then Kimikos face turned sad. "I know that A-chan regrets deeply what she has done. But that does not change the fact that she did Ranma a great wrong, even if she was controlled by her anger. I am very relieved that she's getting her emotions under control now." she said with heartfelt relief. "Tell your little sister that she should not dwell so much on the past and that she has all the chances in the world. She and Ranma were just not meant for each other, as much as it saddens me for my little A-chan. You and Ranma, however, were and are meant for each other."</p><p><b></b>/ …"blood loss stopped. His heart is beating again and we have a regular breathing. That CPR and mouth-to-mouth really did the trick even though it nearly killed him. Now…" /</p><p><b></b>He focussed his eyes on his mother once more and smiled sheepishly. "Sorry, mom."</p><p><b></b>Kimiko Tendo smiled back at her child. "There's no need, my child. You can't help it."</p><p><b></b>He nodded. "You know, mom, in the beginning I felt a bit guilty that I had snatched Ranma from Akane, even though the engagement was off. Okay, make that very guilty." he added at his mothers look. "But when Ranma reciprocated my love it was the most joyful moment in my whole life. She can't say as of yet that she loves me but I know it. And it is the most wonderful thing in the world!" he stated with conviction.</p><p><b></b>His mother smiled. "Yes, she loves you, and she loves you deeply." she said with a deeper still smile. "You two are really a unique couple and I am proud of how you two are coping with your situation. If you continue on this path you will turn the curse into a blessing which will ensure you both a wonderful and fulfilled life. And I want loads and loads of grandchildren!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>"Moooom!" the man-turned-woman exclaimed embarrassed while his mother smirked. "So… you said that you watched us. When?"</p><p><b></b>Kimiko smiled. "You know, when you die you're transported to a stopover where everyone regardless of age, confession or any criteria you could name is grounded for ten years before they're judged. You know, the whole live is reviewed and evaluated and all that. Only last year I ascended to heaven, shortly before A-chan met me. As you don't need to eat, sleep or drink any more you can pretty much watch your family for the whole time if you get permission. Obviously I was allowed. I was also allowed to meet you here in this dreamscape and for that I'm glad."</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro had his jaw on the ground. "You really watched everything that has happened in the last eleven years? <i>Everything</i>?" he asked incredulously.</p><p><b></b>Mrs. Tendo nodded. "Every last bit, and a lot more detailed ever since I entered heaven." she said with a smile. "And I am so happy that you found the love of your life and decided to live again, my child. I know as well as you do that the curse freed you from this life and maybe that is why you're coping so much better with it, am I right? But you have every right to. And Ranma is so good on you and I can't wait to see the cute children you will have." she exclaimed with ardour.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo child blushed once more. "Moooom! You sound just like auntie Nodoka!" he exclaimed embarrassed.</p><p><b></b>His mother smiled mischievously. "Hmm that may be because we were best friends ever since our kindergarten-days." she said and her smile deepened at the look of surprise on her child's face.</p><p><b></b>"Wow. You really knew each other since that long? I mean I knew that auntie knew our family from somewhere but I'd never have guessed…"</p><p><b></b>Kimiko smiled deeper still. "We thought quite alike, No-chan and me; that was why we got along so well. The only thing I did not agree with was her fixation upon manliness and I really felt for poor Ranma. When she allowed that Genma took Ranma onto that dreadful training trip we had a huge fallout and stopped talking to each other. Some time later I got ill and as you know I died little later. To my sadness we never made up so when you see No-chan tell her that I forgave her."</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro looked confused and he tried to remember something he had apparently suppressed. "Mom… you mean to tell me that auntie, the woman who always came to visit us at the Dojo and suddenly stopped so abruptly was auntie Nodoka?"</p><p><b></b>His mother looked at him with surprise. "You remember that?"</p><p><b></b>The man-turned-woman looked at her with a scolding expression. "Mom, I was nine! Of course I remember!" he exclaimed indignantly.</p><p><b></b>Mrs. Tendo had the good grace to look somewhat abashed. "Of course. Forgive me." she said with a smile that could have molten even the most cold-hearted human being. "Yes, that was No-chan. I know that she came to my funeral but afterwards she had too much trouble to be of any help to you four."</p><p><b></b>Seeing her sons' look Kimiko Tendo nodded. "Yes, Genma. He caused trouble for No-chan from the very start of the trip. It was always up to her to pay for any bills he left while he was still in Japan. She often had trouble keeping the house so don't blame her. She had her own troubles to deal with, monetary and emotionally. Sadly No-chan became even more fixated upon her strange ideals of a 'man among men' over time and it hurt me to see that poor Ranma had to hide as Ranko Tendo."</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro nodded. "Yes, that was very hard for her. On one hand her mother was so near but on the other hand she was worlds away. And after the way Genma had painted auntie Ranma never dared to reveal herself; I really felt for her and wished I could have done something but I did not know if auntie would go through with the contract or not. It was a hard time and I was very glad when everything was over. Especially when auntie finally let go of her strange views of manliness."</p><p><b></b>Kimiko Tendo smiled. "Yes my child, that was really well done. I could not have done it better myself, and believe me, I was really good at giving No-chan a good tongue-lashing in my time. I'm really proud of you that you managed it and I know for a fact that No-chan already realised what she did to Ranma with her ideals. I'd not be surprised if she'd make an effort to correct her mistake. Honestly, I'd even not be surprised if Nodoka stopped caring altogether who of you two will give birth to your children. As long as she gets grandchildren in the end. And me too." she teased.</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro blushed once more but could not deny the truth of the statement. It was not too farfetched in Nodoka's case. And his mother seemed to think quite along these same lines too, apparently. "But that is something to consider in the future, mom. I know that I want children with Ranma but we want to take it slowly. Ranma has made so many bad experiences in the past and because I love her so much I don't want to ask too much of her."</p><p><b></b>/ "How is he?" asked a voice that sounded very much like Ranma. /</p><p><b></b>The man-turned-woman blinked to gather his bearings. This… switching was beginning to get irritating; but at least he had heard his love which meant that she was okay. Looking back at his mother he smiled sheepishly, waiting for her to begin anew.</p><p><b></b>Kimiko smiled back. "It is good to take it slowly, my child but know that the love of Ranma is deep and firm. Believe me, the two of you will know when you are ready for children. Your father and I did in our time and so will you two. I'm only sad that I won't be present at your wedding and it saddens me even more that I'll never be able to play with my grandchildren. But I will watch from above, my child. Maybe you two are even going to have two weddings that I can watch?" she asked mischievously.</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro blushed once more. He had really forgotten what an easy time mothers had in embarrassing their children. "I haven't really thought about it yet. First we have to get engaged and with everything that has happened lately I doubt that we'll have a minute to ourselves in which we could tie the knot. I know that I love Ranma more than my life and I love both forms of him/her. I just could not imagine a life without her."</p><p><b></b>His mother nodded in understanding. "I believe that Ranma feels the same way about you. Believe me, you will know when the time is right, when the time to 'tie the knot' as you said has come. Consider that you're the man for the next three months, my child. So it has to be you to get down to one knee and propose if you so chose." she teased with a smile.</p><p><b></b>The man-turned-woman blushed once more but his mother had a point here. He <i>was</i> the man for the next three months and if the time should prove to be right within this timeframe he'd probably do it. "We'll see, mom. But there's still so much to overcome. We'll need a lot of money if we really want to be independent, if we want to have children. And I know we want. I want. And I can see it in Ranma's eyes too. But we need to finish our respective educations and so much more. If it were for my heart I would want to get married to her right away and let nature have its course." he said and then smiled sheepishly. "Okay, make that once I get out of that white nothingness here. But my mind knows that we have to be able to provide for children first." he finished and his smile turned sad.</p><p><b></b>Mrs. Tendo smiled. "Your father and I had the same worries. But believe me, dear, everything will work out. True love has a way of overcoming any obstacle and the love between you two <i>is</i> true love. For monetary issues I can only give you the advice to use what Kami-sama provided you with." she said mysteriously.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded despite not understanding that cryptic remark. "I know that I want to spend the rest of my life with Ranma and I somehow know that he/she feels the same way. I'm glad that auntie Nodoka won't complicate things any more with her former ideals but what can I do about Ranma's father? Surely you know what I'm talking about."</p><p><b></b>His mother's beautiful face scrunched up in anger. Oh yes, she apparently knew what he was talking about. "Yes, Genma Saotome. I always said to No-chan that this man was no good, but did she listen? No." she said with a sigh. "The only good thing that came out of this relationship is Ranma. I only came to know what Genma did to Ranma during their time at our home but I learned of everything he went through when you two came to the Masakis. To say that Ranma's childhood was horrible is a gross understatement and I agree with you when you think that this man shall not be allowed within a mile of my future grandchildren. Normally I believe in the good in people but with Genma it is hard." she said and Yoshiro nodded. "I dearly hope that No-chan will be successful in her attempts at reeducating him but if not… use any measure that is necessary to keep him away." Kimiko finished.</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro nodded. "That I will, mother."</p><p><b></b>/ "I <i>love</i> you, Ka-kun. I love you more than words could ever say. That was the most stupid thing I ever saw that you did for me but also the bravest. I love you and I never want you to leave me. And don't you ever dare doing something this stupid again!" /</p><p><b></b>"Wow!" he exclaimed as soon as he was back with his mother. "Did you hear that?" he asked excitedly. "She really loves me!"</p><p><b></b>His mother hugged him with a big smile plastered on her face. "That she does. And I am so happy for you. For the two of you. Just imagine how it will be once she says it to you face to face, my child."</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro's smile brightened while he hugged his mother for all it was worth. "I can hardly wait!" he exclaimed. "I love her so much that I feel like I must burst to bits and I'm so happy that she's finally said that she feels the same way! I mean I knew it but hearing her <i>say</i> it… damn, if only I could hold her…"</p><p><b></b>Kimiko smiled. Her child really had gotten it really bad and she was so happy for him. Of all her children Kasumi, or rather Yoshiro, now, deserved love the most. When he had been her daughter she had constantly sacrificed her own life for the others, had practically put it on hold and she, Kimiko, had hated it. It was good to see that he was receiving some well-deserved payback. "You will soon be able to, my child. Know that I will always be proud of you, regardless if you're my daughter or my son. I love you, and I will always be with you. Never again forget to live, promise me that."</p><p><b></b>Her cursed child smiled back. "I promise, mother. I doubt that I'll ever get back to how it was, not that I would want to anyway. Ranma has changed my life so much and all for the better. It was not her fault that I got injured and almost died; it was my decision to do what I did. And it's good to know that she managed to come out on top again." he said proudly only to grew solemn in a flash. "If only things were as easy in regards that don't pertain fighting…" he sighed.</p><p><b></b>His mother looked puzzled. "What do you mean, son?" she asked, underlining her statement from earlier that she accepted him as her son.</p><p><b></b>In spite of himself he smiled at this show of acceptance. "I refer to one of the many occasions in Ranma's life where Genma Saotome fouled up. I don't know if you know of it, mom, but Genma engaged Ranma to a girl named Ukyo Kuonji when he was six. Poor Ranma had no idea of this and thought that Ukyo was a boy. Genma let him in this belief and tricked him into choosing between Okonomiyaki and Ukyo. Knowing Ranma's appetite" here both Tendos smiled "he chose Okonomiyaki. Ten years later Ukyo came to Ranma's school to get her revenge but in the end Ukyo ended up engaged to Ranma. Due to the fact that Genma stole the dowry the claim is as strong as ours. I just don't know what to do."</p><p><b></b>Even the angelic Kimiko Tendo looked remarkably angry. "I did know all of it, my child. Engaging a child is not bad per se although I personally never liked arranged marriages. They were much too medieval for my taste and I was really angry when your father came home one night, drunk of course, and proclaimed that the schools would be joined through marriage. But there was little I could do against it and seeing how it turned out in Ranma's and A-chan's case I'd say that I was right. It's different in yours and Ranma's case for when you'll marry you'll marry out of love." she said with a smile. "Now back to Ukyo. I know I shouldn't be doing this and I'll probably get into some trouble but I can help you."</p><p><b></b>To say that Yoshiro was curious would have been an understatement. "Help? How?"</p><p><b></b>His mother smiled. "As I knew of the situation I called in some favours. And when I was allowed to visit you here in this dreamscape between the mortal realm and the heavens I knew it was the perfect opportunity. When A-chan came some months ago I hadn't found out then but now I know it."</p><p><b></b>"What, mom?" Yoshiro asked.</p><p><b></b>Kimiko Tendos' smiled deepened. "I know the location of the yattai Genma Saotome stole. And it is still intact." she said.</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro's eyes gleamed. "That is awesome, mom!" he exclaimed. "Can you tell me?"</p><p><b></b>She shook her head and Yoshiro's head dropped in disappointment. "But I can <i>show</i> you." she said with a smile. At seeing his questioning glance she explained. "You know that I said I had ascended to heaven a year ago? Well, I'm an angel in training. I was judged and found to have led an exemplary life; thus I was offered this position, a rare honour, mind you, and I accepted."</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro's eyes bugged out. "You… you're an angel? Really?" he asked disbelieving.</p><p><b></b>His mother nodded. "That I am. And to forestall your questions, no, I don't have wings as of yet. Angels only get their wings once they've completed their training. But I do have certain abilities already and one of them is the mental projection of my thoughts. Watch and try to remember as many details as possible. This is the cave where Genma Saotome has hidden the yattai all those years ago."</p><p><b></b>He nodded and with that Kimiko Tendo began to project the mental image. Yoshiro marvelled at the detailed 3d-image that appeared in thin air and heeding his mother's advice he tried to memorise as much as possible of the landscape shown to him. Once he was sure that he could not memorise any more details he nodded; apparently his mother had understood him and stopped the projection.</p><p><b></b>It was visible that it had taken a lot out of her and Yoshiro smiled thankfully. "Thank you, mom. That will really help us. But it will still be hard to convince Ukyo to lay off. She really loves Ranma and I feel we have to repay her for the years she spent on planning her revenge because what Genma did. That is at least what Ranma feels, although I don't know how I know."</p><p><b></b>Kimiko smiled. "You loved Ranma for quite some time and you know how she acts and thinks. As a matter of fact I'm quite sure that you're right with your hunch. From watching her life I know that Ranma is honourable to a fault which means that she'll try to make it up to Ukyo."</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro nodded. "Exactly. Even if it was not her but Genma's fault she will try everything short of marrying Ukyo to repay her. And Ukyo is so convinced that Ranma loves her that she'll never give up. I'm quite sure she's trying even now to find us." he said with a sigh.</p><p><b></b>Kimiko agreed. "You're right, dear. She <i>is </i>trying to find you two." she explained and smiled sheepishly. "I watched her. After all, a mother has to look out for her children as much as she can. I'm only sorry that I can't say when she's going to find you. But she will."</p><p><b></b>He smiled at his mother. "Thanks, mom. What you did for us is more than enough."</p><p><b></b>Kimiko smiled back. "You're welcome, dear. Oh, please tell A-chan and Nabs that they're on the right path. If they continue on it they'll find their happiness too. Just like you have, my child."</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro practically grinned at his mother. "I will, mom." he said, and then his face got a wistful look. "And I pray every day that Ko-chan won't get hurt in the encounter we're bound to have with Ukyo. She's been hurt so often in her life and I can't stand it. If only Genma had acted more responsible a lot could have been avoided."</p><p><b></b>His mother nodded. "Yes, if only. But now she has you and together you're stronger for it. And the two of you will need this strength for what is to come." she said, and from the look on his mother's face he knew that she would not say any more. Then she smiled once more. "But first the two of you will get the chance to be yourselves. Help Ránmā to discover her female half but don't push her into something that she is not. That is especially something my dear friend No-chan has to realise. Should Ránmā not be able to get the point across please assist your girlfriend."</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo child nodded. "Of course. I've long since realised that it's impossible to make Ránmā into a perfect lady and I'm sure she'll always be a tomboy. But <i>maybe</i> we'll be able to get her to behave somewhat like a lady at least. Though I'll never force her into anything; I love her and I'd never hurt her. She's been hurt too often in her life."</p><p><b></b>Kimiko Tendo smiled at her child's declaration. He was deeply in love with No-chan's child and she was happy for the two of them. "Yes, that she has. But through your love she has finally found what she has been missing out on for her whole life. Love. Friendship. Trust. Someone to lean into, to depend on. Everything that most people take for granted. Take good care of her and give me some grandchildren to watch over." she said with a straight face, although her eyes were twinkling madly.</p><p><b></b>It took some seconds for Yoshiro to decipher the last line and when he has he blushed. Again. "Moooom! I told you we'd take it slow. Honest, you're as bad as auntie!" he said with a shake of his head.</p><p><b></b>Mrs. Tendo smiled. "Guilty as charged. But you're right, before you two can settle down and become parents your problems have to be solved. And I agree, Ukyo will prove to be a hard nut to crack. Even if you two recover the yattai it will be hard to convince her of how things are. She's spent ten years preparing her revenge and over a year chasing Ranma. But I believe my little Nabs will help you two in that regard. Oh, before I forget, tell Nabs that I'm very proud of her. Finally she has understood what I had to learn too, the very thing you taught her: money is not everything. I'm very proud of you, all of you. I will always love you."</p><p><b></b>Acting on impulse Yoshiro hugged his mother for all it was worth. "I love you too, mom; and the others do too." he said with tears in his eyes. "It's good to know that you'll watch over us."</p><p><b></b>Mrs. Tendo had tears in her eyes herself. "I'll always watch over you. And I expect you to make me a grandmother one of these days, my child." she said in a mock-stern tone that made Yoshiro laugh. "Now rest, my child. Rest and get well… goodbye. I'll watch over you, all of you."</p><p><b></b>Yoshiro smiled. "Bye, mom. Love you." he said.</p><p><b></b>His mother smiled one last time. "I love you too, my child." she said, and then she was gone.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
