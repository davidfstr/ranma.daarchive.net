No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 13</b></p><p><b>Interlude: Nerima Part 1</b></p><p><b></b>It was the day after Kasumi and Ranma had hit the road for their trip to find themselves. A Sunday to be exact. Soun Tendo knew nothing of it. Not yet. All he knew, was that he had a hangover that was world-class. And all that thanks to his friend Genma, who could not bear feminine topics like a period, and had to get drunk like he had not been ever since they had celebrated the incarceration of the master. And par for the course, Genma had dragged him down the path too.</p><p><b></b>Admittedly, he had been extremely lucky, that Kasumi had given Nabiki and Akane the 'talk' when they had started their respective times, but that was beside the point. Genma would have to accept the fact, that he had a part-time daughter now and forever, or the Saotome females would lose their patience with him. And considering especially Ranmas' power and strength, not much would remain of his old friend, should Ranma lose his/her patience with his old friend and blow his/her top.</p><p><b></b>That Kasumi had been cursed to become a male, and everything else that had happened in the adjacent time, had opened Soun's eyes to the idea, that he would from now on always have a part-time son. And as he had come to know Ranma's curse in the past year more than well enough, he knew, that Kasumi would be his son at least for half of the time.</p><p><b></b>Which also meant, that he would, should Ranma ever marry Kasumi, have a daughter-in-law as well as a son-in-law. What Cologne had said had sealed it, and he himself had now accepted, that Ranma as well as his Kasumi would always be cursed to become the opposite gender. But honestly, now that they had matching curses, where was the problem with it?</p><p><b></b>Only Genma was dead-set against the concept, and even when he had tried to convince him, that the matching curses could be an advantage for Ranma in Kasumi (and by proxy for them), because their children now had more common ground, his old friend had refused to accept it. Genma had wanted to hear nothing of it, and had gotten himself even more drunk. He could not really understand his old friend. What was so bad about having a daughter instead of a son for half of the time? He himself had three daughters, and he was doing just fine.</p><p><b></b>Okay, it was nice, that one of his most secret wishes had come true, for he had always wished for a son. And now, due to the curse, he had gotten one. So accepting it was somewhat easier for him, but honestly, Genma had had over a year now to accept Ranma's curse. Soun shook his head, but stopped that at once when he noticed that it was not an advisable action at the moment. <b>'Genma, Genma, Genma, old friend...' </b>he thought,<b> 'when will you stop being such a woman hating idiot?'</b></p><p><b></b>Sighing, Soun got out of the bed and staggered towards the door. What he needed now was a coffee. Black. Not his usual Darjeeling tea he drank else. And luckily for his poor, abused head, Kasumi kept an extra supply of <i>strong</i> coffee for cases like this.</p><p><b></b>Ah, his sweet daughter Kasumi. What would the household be without her? Little did Soun know, that he would find out soon. But ignorant to all what had transpired the day before after Genma had fled the house with him in tow, Soun staggered into the bathroom to freshen up somewhat.</p><p><b></b>Ten minutes later Soun emerged from the bathroom, fully clothed and somewhat fresher. Then he sniffed the air. <b>'Ahh, Kasumi is as perceptive as ever. The coffee is already prepared. Good, daughter.' </b>he thought as he walked down the stairs. He would have smiled at his daughters' thoughtfulness, but that hurt his poor, abused head too much at the moment.</p><p><b></b>"Good morning, Kasumi." he said automatically upon arriving in the kitchen, until reality registered itself in Soun's mind. Who was standing at the stove, currently preparing breakfast, was <i>not</i> Kasumi!</p><p><b></b>"Good morning to you too, Soun. And no, I am not Kasumi. Sit down and I'll get you a coffee. You look like you need a strong one." Nodoka said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Soun stood there flabbergasted, gaping like a fish out of water for a minute or so. Nodoka found this highly amusing, poured him a cup of coffee in the meantime, and held it under Soun's nose, which revived him. '<b>Good, I thought he was broke.' </b>Nodoka thought amused.</p><p><b></b>Finally doing as Nodoka had suggested, Soun slumped down into his usual chair. After he had sipped his hot coffee, which had jump-started his brain somewhat, Soun looked at Nodoka questioningly. "Nodoka, what are <i>you</i> doing in the kitchen? I mean... aside from preparing breakfast? You are a guest, Nodoka. Guests don't prepare breakfast. Where is Kasumi?"</p><p><b></b>Suddenly a yell could be heard from upstairs. "Where the heck is that worthless son of mine!"</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch looked irritated, while Nodoka smirked. So, her dear husband had found out that Ranma was not there, had he? It was too too bad for Genma, as Shampoo would say, that he could not launch their child into the Koi-pond, like usual. That had apparently been one of the most favourite sports of Genma: to annoy their child. She vowed that she would put a stop to this, when Ranma and Kasumi returned.</p><p><b></b>But maybe she would not even need to do so. Ever since their talk, Nodoka knew that Ranma would not put up with any more shit from his/her father. She could relate very well to that. And<i> that</i> she could relate to very good. She herself was still busy untangling all the messes her dear husband had created. And due to the fact, that Genma still refused to raise a single finger to undo it by himself, she was <i>very</i> upset with him. For that left <i>her</i> to deal with what Genma had done, and the more she learned of his behaviour, the more her ire grew.</p><p><b></b>Seconds later the object of her ire came stomping down the stairs, probably waking up the whole house in the process. Which would surely irritate those who wished to sleep in on this Sunday, especially as it was still one hour until breakfast would normally be served.</p><p><b></b>In this case it might be a good thing, however. Nodoka would love to have the sharp tongued Nabiki to aid her when she told them what had happened after the men had left to get drunk. But first she'd have to call her husband to order. "Husband, don't make such a racket. I will explain everything when everyone has come down. Which will obviously be soon due to the great hullabaloo you made. Now sit down and drink your coffee." she commanded with steel in her voice.</p><p><b></b>Genma ducked his head. He knew this tone of voice all too well. Any resistance on his part was utterly futile. "Yes, dear." he answered meekly.</p><p><b></b>And thus, one part-time Panda and the Tendo patriarch sat there, sipping their coffees and wondering, what on Earth had happened now. Why was <i>Nodoka</i> preparing breakfast? And where was Ranma? And Kasumi had not been seen either. Were these facts connected? And if so, what did it mean? Questions upon questions, but sadly no answers.</p><p><b></b>Shrugging, the Tendo patriarch reached for the newspaper and busied himself with it. It seemed, that he would get the answers later. Meanwhile, the sometimes-panda continued to brood on where his worthless son was. What had the idiot boy done now? Alas, he was nothing but trouble.</p><p><b></b>Ten minutes later, a still very sleepy looking, but already fully clothed Nabiki came walking down the stairs, looking somewhat like a zombie. With a muttered "Coffee, must have coffee." the middle Tendo daughter reached for a cup and filled it with the hot liquid.</p><p><b></b>Then she sat down in her usual spot, and began sipping her coffee, which gradually woke her up. Once her brain had reached working temperature, she began to assess the situation. <b>'Hmm, 'uncle' Genma is brooding, he obviously found out that Ranma is not here. His yelling was a dead give away in that regard and could have woken the dead. Daddy seems to be unconcerned at the moment, as he probably knows he will get the answers later. And Nodoka seems to have everything under control. Good. Now only baby-sis has to come down and the party can start.'</b> she thought with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded to Nabiki impalpably, and the Ice-queen nodded back the same way. Then Nodoka looked at Soun. "Soun, could you call down Akane, so we can tell you and her, what has transpired yesterday after you left?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>The Tendo Patriarch looked up from his newspaper and nodded. Finally he would get some answers. <b>"AKANE! COME DOWN HERE THIS INSTANT!"</b> he bellowed, using his demon-head technique to amplify his voice. Silently he muttered to himself. He'd have to have a good talk with her later.</p><p><b></b>At the same time Nodoka prepared a cup of tea for the youngest Tendo daughter, and made sure to add the strongest batch of calming herbs Kasumi had available. The oldest Tendo child had explained to her, that measures had to be taken to calm the temper of her youngest sister, until their father decided to get Akane professional help. But until that time, they would have to do what was possible with the means they had at hand. Thus Nodoka prepared the tea, and set it onto the spot where Akane usually sat.</p><p><b></b>If the youngest Tendo daughter had not been awake already, she would be awake now. And really, five minutes later shuffling steps could be heard from the stairs, and half a minute later a very grumpy looking Akane appeared. "What did you wake me up for so early? It better be good!"</p><p><b></b>Soun's face reddened. "If you have still not understood, daughter, the time of your tantrums is over! For good! I have been far too lenient with you, but that will not be repeated. <b>NOW SIT DOWN!"</b> he said, using the demon-head for the last three words.</p><p><b></b>Instantly Akane obeyed, with not a little fear on her face. Apparently daddy was really taking the kids gloves off. Damn! This was all Ranma's fault! Sulking, she stared ahead and grabbed the cup of tea that stood before her to warm herself up. After all, she had had to leave the warmness of her bed much too early for her taste, and that she was sitting here now instead of lying in her warm, comfy bed, was all Ranma's fault. Should he show his face here any time soon she'd show him!</p><p><b></b>Nabiki could only shake her head at Akane's behaviour. Had her little sister still not comprehended what she had done? Obviously not, for she was still acting like a spoiled princess. Well, it was high time to take her down from her 'throne'. And she'd be glad to have a hand in it. Her little sis had always been the spoiled brat, who had gotten everything she wanted for far too long, and that she had always destroyed things that she, Nabiki, had to pay for in the end, and ended up scott free to boot, had incensed her for a long time. And now that daddy had realised that, it was definite time to change some things here.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka looked into the round and began. "I'll get right to the point. After what happened yesterday," she said, and looked meaningful and with a stern glare at Akane, who glowered right back, "and after you two left to get drunk, we," she pointed at Nabiki, "and Cologne decided upon a plan to help Ranma and Kasumi to get used to their curses. To this end it was decided, that those two had to leave on a training trip. They will live in their alternate forms to get used to them. For approximately three to four months, maybe even longer. To this end, I will withdraw Ranma tomorrow from Furinkan High."</p><p><b></b>"WHAT!" Genma and Soun bellowed instantly and in stereo.</p><p><b></b>It was Soun who regained his breath first again. "How could you let my precious baby leave on a training trip? And for three to four months? Living as a boy? WAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!" he exclaimed, waterworks fully engaged.</p><p><b></b>Genma was red-faced. "You <i>really</i> went through with this idiotic idea, that Ranma has to get used to being a girl and should therefore live as one? I can't believe it! My son is living as a weak, worthless girl! The shame!"</p><p><b></b>Now Nodoka had really lost her patience with the attitude of her husband, and for the first time since long she produced a battle aura. And it was <i>very</i> impressive. Nabiki nearly whistled, and her father looked somewhat shocked at the power she exuded. The middle Tendo daughter could not sense power-levels, but she felt that that was a lot of power.</p><p><b></b>Akane, who had been sitting opposite Nodoka, slowly edged backwards, for she could have sworn she had seen fire flash in Nodoka's eyes. A second later a now well-known sound echoed through the house. SHING. "Husband, I really have had enough of your idiotic misogynistic tendencies. I have put up with them for long enough! Do you want a demonstration how 'weak' <i>I</i> am, or are you going to behave from now on? For if you are not, I would be more than glad to repeat the performance of our daughter. And you<i> know</i> I can. So chose wisely!"</p><p><b></b>The misogynistic idiot, who had at this moment a very sharp katana pressed against his neck by his very irate and angry wife, could only gulp. He knew, that Nodoka would carry out her threat, and he also knew, that she was sadly (for him) <i>more</i> than strong enough to do so. She seldom displayed her true strength, and <i>if</i> she did, it meant that she was truly and utterly pissed.</p><p><b></b>Even Akane had blanched at Nodoka's words and her display of power. She always had thought Ranma's mother to be a push-over without her sword, but now she knew, that she could not have been farther away from the truth. The youngest Tendo daughter could not read auras as good as Ranma, far from it, but even she sensed that Nodoka was<i> really </i>strong! No, Nodoka was not someone, whose ire you wanted to raise, that she realised now.</p><p><b></b>Slowly it dawned on her, that Ranma had not inherited his skills and power from Genma, but from his mother. She shuddered as she remembered, that she had insulted Nodoka yesterday, and tried to make herself tiny and unnoticeable. Compared to this woman she was really untrained.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Nodoka was getting impatient. "Now, husband? <i>Do</i> you need a repeat performance to freshen up your memory?"</p><p><b></b>Genma had blanched even further. No, last time had been more than enough! "No, No-chan. There... there will be no need."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled sweetly as she removed the katana from her husbands neck. "See, that wasn't so hard now, was it? But if I hear one, only one deprecatory comment about females, be it about women in general or our daughter in special, I <i>will </i>give you a repeat performance. Gladly. Have you understood?"</p><p><b></b>Genma nodded vigorously. Then he suddenly scampered to the sink, and got himself a glass of cold water, which he promptly upended over his head. # <i>I am just a cute panda.</i> # Flip. # <i>Give me some bamboo.</i> #</p><p><b></b>No one was amused by that, and not only Nabiki shook her head at the display. Pathetic. Getting her thoughts back to what had happened just a few moments ago, Nabiki mused to herself, that she would really like to know, what Nodoka had meant by 'repeat performance'. She looked at her father, but even he seemed to be clueless. Which was odd. Hmm, maybe she would find out later.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Nodoka coughed to get everyone's attention, and even Akane made an effort to listen. "As I said before I was interrupted, Ranma and Kasumi are presently on a training trip. They hit the road yesterday evening, and will travel to a destination unknown to us. There they plan to stay for at least three to four months. In their cursed forms, to get used to their alternate bodies. Both of them must come to terms with the fact, that they are now both, both man and woman. We made this decision," she paused for a moment, "so that they would be undisturbed. What with Ranma's suitors and all the craziness in Nerima it would never have worked."</p><p><b></b>"WAAAAAAAAHHH! My baby girl is going to live as a boy! WAAAAAAAHHH!" the Tendo patriarch wailed.</p><p><b></b>"Soun!" Nodoka bellowed, "Get a grip on yourself! Would you have liked it better, if she had hid in the house until she had become old and grey, only to avoid changing forms?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki interrupted, before her father could answer, for she <i>knew</i> the answer, and it made her angry. "No, don't answer the question, dad. You <i>must</i> understand one thing: it was <i>high time</i>, that Kasumi left this house to see the world on her own. To make experiences. Ever since after highschool she has been <i>trapped</i> in this house, and she has constantly catered to our every wishes. Over time we got used to it and took it as normal, that Kasumi was <i>always</i> in the house except for the shopping. And why not? She never protested, ne?"</p><p><b></b>Soun wanted to say something, but Nabiki raised her index finger and interrupted him. "No, I'm not finished. Kasumi was practically our <i>slave</i>, dad. She never could live out <i>her</i> dreams and hopes, for she always had to care for us and our needs, while we, all of us, lived out our lives to the fullest, while she could only watch. We did nothing in the household, nothing to help her at all, and it shames me. We have all been too selfish to see, that Kasumi was literally trapped in the chains of this household. To take care of us she had practically given up her life! You know what, dad? The curse <i>freed</i> her, for it enabled her to break out. And don't expect her to return and take over the household again as if nothing had happened. For now you also have a son, and I doubt that Yoshiro will be chained down."</p><p><b></b>Soun had grown increasingly paler throughout Nabiki's speech. <b>'Oh my Kami-sama, she is right!' </b>had been the thoughts of the Tendo patriarch, as he had truly realised for the first time, what they had done to Kasumi. They <i>had</i> neverlifted a finger to help Kasumi, although that would have also been their duty, like in any other normal household.</p><p><b></b>They <i>had</i> really lived like nothing had happened after Kimiko´s death, and had Kasumi let take her mothers' place as a housewife with all the duties and responsibilities, and that on cost of Kasumi's life. Shamefacedly Soun bowed his head. "You are right, daughter. How we, and especially <i>I </i>treated Kasumi, is inexcusable. I never saw it before, but as you said, Nabiki, we had gotten used to it because she never protested. I can now accept, that this training trip is a good idea, and who knows, maybe I will get real a son out of it. But who is this Yoshiro?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smirked satisfied. It was good, that she had been able to bring the point home, although she had expected more resistance. But who cared, an easy victory was a victory after all. "I bet you didn't know, that there is a bureau dealing with Jusenkyo victims, eh, dad?" she asked, and at seeing Soun's astonished look at his daughter and then Genma-panda's inquiring sign (which was ignored) she continued. "Well, there is one, and they deal with Jusenkyo victims, and how to integrate the alternate forms of cursed victims with a gender-changing curse into society. After all, a cursed victim could decide to live as the opposite gender for the rest of his or her life. Thus, this agency provides ID-cards for victims of the Nyannichuan, the Nannichuan and the other gender and personality changing springs. I contacted them, and had let them construct the identities of Ránmā Saotome and Yoshiro Tendo. Plus adapted and official maintenance histories for school and college. Cool, ne?"</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch was more than baffled, as was Akane. Said Tendo daughter boiled. "WHAT! The pervert is living as a girl for three months or longer? As a <i>girl</i>? How dare he! He's not even a <i>real</i> girl!" she yelled.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka glowered again, but it was Nabiki who put her foot down. "Little sis," she said in an icy tone that chilled the whole room, "that is enough! You constantly accused and still accuse Ranma of being a pervert. Why? It was <i>you</i>, who walked in on <i>him</i> in the furo when he had arrived here. It was <i>you</i>,who walked in on <i>him</i> again a few days ago and all the other times. It is <i>you</i>, who has a collection of porn-mags hidden under your bed. And don't bother to dispose of them, I've got photos. Why? Why do you always accuse Ranma of being a pervert? Not that it matters any more, for you have blown all chances with him, but I would like to know. Why are you so angry at Ranma? Feed my curiosity."</p><p><b></b>Akane only glowered defiantly at her older sister. "He <b>is </b>a pervert, because he always has one girl or the other hanging off of him! And I know, that he is doing perverted things with them! Then there is, that he has a female body! Untold, what he could have done to the poor girls body and probably has! He is the biggest pervert ever, and sure as hell no girl!"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki could only smack her head, while Nodoka visibly bristled at these immature and unfounded accusations. "Do you really <i>believe</i> all this bullshit, sis? For if so, it is for the best that you did not marry Ranma. First, as for the girls hanging off of him, and I know you mean Shampoo, have you never noticed how much he <i>hates</i> it when she glomps him? He's not squirming because he enjoys it, but because he is uncomfortable! I saw it yesterday really clearly for the first time. He <i>hates</i> it."</p><p><b></b>Her sister still glowered. "If he hates it so much, why does he not break free? Can't be so hard, after all, he is the 'best' martial artist there is, as he always boasts."</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter sighed, and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like 'green' and 'envy' before she answered. "Do you know, <i>where</i> he would have to push Shampoo if he wanted to break free? I'll give you a hint. There is only one way. Can you guess?" she asked, but her sister shook her head. Nabiki then pointed at her own chest. "He could only push her here, directly at her boobs. But what you didn't know, is that if he would have done so, he could have said bai-bai to Japan."</p><p><b></b>Now Nodoka was curious. And she was not the only one. "What do you mean, Nabiki?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki grimaced. "It is something I found out about the Amazons and their customs when I got my hands on one of their rulebooks per chance. Shampoo had lost one of hers one time she had delivered ramen here, and I snatched it without her noticing it. If a male, who is regarded as an Airen by an Amazon warrior, but who has not consummated the relationship with her, touches the Amazon warrior at her boobs, then that means his total submission towards the Amazon and her claim, as it displays his will to consummate the relationship by initiating intimate contact. You see, if Ranma <i>had </i>pushed her in the chest to free himself, he would now be an Amazon. For I am sure, that Cologne would have set lose all hell to get him into the tribe had he done that."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka had blanched. "Oh my, that could have ended badly. Good thing, that this matter is dealt with."</p><p><b></b>Soun and the Panda looked at her. Genma actually went to the sink, and managed to grab the kettle with hot water, with which he restored himself to human form. "What do you mean by this, No-chan?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki waved it off. "Later. Let's only say the Amazon problem is dealt with permanently and satisfyingly, and let me continue what I was saying." Nabiki interrupted. "So you see, sis, had he done this, it would have been bad for him. Very much so. But nice as I am, I sold this information to him. For a reasonable fee. Now Ranma knew he had no other choice but to either avoid her glomp, which was not always possible due to the speed of hers when on her bike, or to get clobbered by you to get out of the glomp. Do you <i>still</i> think he was enjoying this? Oh, and as for Ukyo, he said repeatedly to her, that he sees her as a friend, and <i>only</i> as a friend. And I have plenty recordings and other evidence of it. I can assure you, that he only treated her as a friend, and nothing else. And you would have noticed it too, had your mind not been so clouded by anger and hate."</p><p><b></b>Now Akane sputtered. "But... but I don't hate him! I loved him! I <i>still</i> do…" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka and Nabiki snorted in stereo. "What a fine way of showing him that you had, sis. With a mallet to the head. With food, that would have killed a lesser person. With constant insults. Do you know, that I witnessed the one time, when you said that he was a pervert, and perverts could never be trusted?"</p><p><b></b>Akane shook her head and Nabiki continued. "I could see his face, Akane. Your words had hurt him more deeply than you could have ever managed with your mallet. At this moment, you broke his heart. Because what you did not consider, sis, is that a relationship is <i>nothing</i> without trust. And as you said yourself, you never trusted Ranma. Therefore, any relationship between the two of you was doomed. And it was sure as hell not Ranma's fault!"</p><p><b></b>Akane glowered at her older sister, then she looked at her father. "Dad, how can you let Nabiki talk like that to me? I have done nothing wrong! It was all the perverts fault! Had he not made me so angry all the time, nothing would have happened! I may love him, but he has no right to make me so angry!"</p><p><b></b>Instead of getting the support she expected to get from her father, she only got a shake of the head from Soun. He had shielded Akane from living up to her actions for far too long. "My little Akane, you have to realise, that the engagement between you and Ranma is off. For good. And Nabiki has every right to tell you how it is. I closed my eyes for far too long from reality, my child. I have been lenient with you, and I have spoiled you, and it didn't do you any good. I am sorry, that I haven't given you the support you would have needed, but that will change. However, I believe that your sister was not quite finished yet. If you want, Nabiki…" the Tendo patriarch said. He really liked, how his middle daughter was handling the situation, and he doubted, that he could have done a better job.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nodded. "Thanks, dad. Little sis, despite all that you had done to him, he still tried to make it work, and gave you <i>one more chance</i>. Did you know, that he swore an oath on his honour as a martial artist, that he would give you one more month to make it work, despite how you had treated him? Heck, had it been me who had been treated so, I would probably have killed you. You treated him worse, than one would treat a blood enemy! But despite that, he didn't give up on you. And we all know, how his generosity turned out. As for Ranma being a pervert because he has a girls body, let me tell you something. Akane, Ranma never had the 'talk'! Neither he nor she had an even an inkling of knowledge regarding sexuality, so all your harping about perversity is the biggest joke ever! Ranma is as innocent as they come, in both forms! But did you ever care to ask Ranma if he knew anything about it?"</p><p><b></b>Akane sputtered, but no answer came forth. Nodoka looked proudly at Nabiki. She could not have said or done it better, and it seemed, as if her child would get at least one nice sister-in-law. Although she still hoped for Akane. Taking a deep breath, Nabiki continued her assault, determined to bring down the walls of delusions Akane had built around her for good. "The answer is: no, you didn't! You always assumed the worst of Ranma, regardless the situation. And all your harping about the perversities he or she supposedly committed surely did not help Ranma, to develop any sexuality in either form. I only hope, he or she never sues us because of what you did, for Ranma's chances to win would be more than good! What you must understand, sister dear, is that not what someone <i>is</i> makes them perverted, but their <i>actions</i>. And Ranma did never act like a pervert. For it were the other girls, who constantly threw themselves at Ranma, not the other way around, sis."</p><p><b></b>Akane nearly cried as her world-view came tumbling down around her. "But... but he made me so <i>angry</i>!" she yelled.</p><p><b></b>Soun sighed. "I know I have made a lot of mistakes with you, my little Akane, but you should have talked to Ranma about what it was, that made you so angry. I myself am as much to blame as you, for had not Genma and I pushed you two together at each and any occasion, it might have gone differently. And I should never have allowed you to hit Ranma. Hitting people does not solve problems, daughter, it creates them. I am shamed to admit, that I let you treat Ranma, a guest and potential son-in-law, really worse than a blood enemy. From now on you will receive therapy with a good shrink to get your temper under control, and don't you dare oppose me. The weak man you knew is gone. From now on I will be your father again, and I'll act upon my responsibilities, even if this means walking down the hard way."</p><p><b></b>The youngest Tendo daughter was about to sputter, that everything was Ranma's fault, while the others, except Genma, who saw the danger, that Soun would not be as easy to manipulate as in the past, were extremely proud of Soun. It really seemed, that the man Nodoka had known before Kimiko's death was slowly coming back. And also the middle Tendo daughter was very glad, that her father was back after all this time. She had really missed him, and the empty shell he had been had been hardly more than a shadow of the father he had been. Only Akane seemed to be confused by the sudden resistance and backbone of her father.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded towards Soun with a smile. "Good to hear that, Soun. The path of a true martial artist is not the easy or the convenient one, but the path, which is occasionally fraught with peril and hardships. But it is the only one, the just one, and only this path allows us to keep our honour. I'm pleased to see, that you rediscovered it, and hope, that my dear husband will come around too." she said. <b>'Although I doubt it.'</b> she added as a thought.</p><p><b></b>Soun nodded and bowed. "Thank you, Nodoka. What happened to Kasumi made me realise, that I can't afford to stay weak any more. I will start to train once again, and once I deem myself ready, I will start teaching in the Dojo again. This is what Kimiko would have wanted, that I realise now. Although it saddens me, that my grief blinded me for so long. But this is over and done with!" he exclaimed with conviction.</p><p><b></b>Both Tendo childs' were awed by the change in their father, and especially Nabiki was nearly ecstatic. Maybe their father would finally, finally help to support the household! She barely dared to hope, but his comment about teaching in the Dojo once more was more than a silver lining. That would take a lot of weight from her shoulders, and maybe she could start to implement something she had wanted for a long time now: her retirement from the money-grabber business.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Nodoka looked questioningly at Akane. "Akane, my child treated you better and better during the last three months, ever since Kasumi began to tutor him. I can attest to that he did not insult you if he could prevent it, and he even tried your cooking. And despite that you treated him worse than garbage. You even hit him when he was recuperating from one of your malletings in Kasumi's bedroom. Why, Akane? What did my child do to deserve this much anger and hate?"</p><p><b></b>The youngest Tendo had her face to the ground and was now crying. "I don't... hate him. I never did. But what he did... at Jusendo... I had died, <i>really</i> died. And I was... with mom. All was so peaceful and nice, and I never... wanted to go <i>back</i>. Then... I heard Ranma yell my name... and suddenly I was... ripped away from mom. I... didn't <i>want </i>to go back. I wanted to... stay with her. That is, why I am so angry with Ranma. He brought me back." she sobbed.</p><p><b></b>Everyone was extremely surprised, for no one had expected <i>this </i>explanation. Finally Soun got up and embraced his daughter in a hug, for Nabiki was still stunned. Soun was still angry at his daughter for what she had done, and she would still get punished, but right now she needed comfort, not punishment. "Sshh... its okay, my little pumpkin. It's okay..." he soothed the still crying girl.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka felt for the girl. That explained her actions and behaviour somewhat and it also explained why it had become so much worse after Jusendo, but it still did not justify the behaviour of Akane. No, the engagement was off for good and it would remain this way.</p><p><b></b>And she better drove this point home before her husband had another brilliant idea. "Akane, though I can understand you now somewhat better, this still does not justify your behaviour towards my child. At Jusendo Ranma showed you, how much he loved you by even bringing you back from the dead. Of course, it must have been a shock, to be ripped away from Kimiko, but have you stopped to think, that it might not have been your time to die? Else you <i>would</i> not have come back. You know now, that your mother is waiting for you in heaven, but you have still your whole life to live. Sadly without my child, Akane. I am afraid, that your behaviour towards him killed any love he had for you, and the engagement is and will be off for good. I am sad, that it did not work out. But apparently it is for the better this way."</p><p><b></b>Akane was send into another fresh bout of tears over this. Finally, reality settled down upon her. She had<i> really</i> driven Ranma away <i>for good</i>. And she <i>had not</i> stopped to think, that it might not have been her time to die. All reason had been clouded by her anger and temper at having been ripped away from her mother by Ranma. And this had led to her unthinking actions against her iinazuke. Which had led to this situation. <b>'Ex-iinazuke. It is <i>really</i> over. And it's all <i>my</i> fault!' </b>she thought, and cried bitterly. She had really loved him, but Nodoka's words had made it clear to her, that <i>she </i>had been the one who had destroyed this love. Not Shampoo, not Ukyo, not Kodachi. She. And she would have to live with it for the rest of her life.</p><p><b></b>Slowly she walked upstairs towards her room, where she lay down on her bed. Reality slowly began to sink in. Ranma was no pervert, and had never been one. He had really loved her, but she had killed those feelings through her own words and actions. She. Nobody else. Silently Akane Tendo cried into her pillow.</p><p><b></b>Later, after everything had settled down and breakfast had been consumed Nabiki had told them of Cologne's decision and its consequences. She also admonished them, to keep it an absolute secret, as Shampoo did not know about it, and was not to know. After a happy celebration, the men and Akane, who had also been happy, that the Amazons were out of their hair (even if it was of no use to her any more), agreed to keep it secret.</p><p><b></b>Now Genma was on top again. Finally, the thing with the stupid Amazons had been resolved. All that remained to be done so that he could enjoy his retirement and live off from the sweat and hard work of his son and future wife was the removal of the other engagement. But there would be a way, he was sure. No-chan and Nabiki just had to look hard enough. With the Amazons out of the way, there was really no reason for his manly son to remain a silly and weak girl, was there?</p><p><b></b>True to form Genma voiced these thoughts, apparently ignorant of the fact, that Nodoka had already decided upon the issue. "Nodoka, I demand that you end this charade. As head of the Clan Saotome, I forbid that my child has to live as a weak and useless girl. I did not raise my child to be a weak girl, but a man among men! He will be the heir to my school one time, when I have made him a master! So find a way to contact our son, and call this stupid and useless charade off! My son is no dishonourable girl…" he trailed off and watched his wife. "No-chan?" he asked carefully.</p><p><b></b>Watching Nodoka while Genma talked, was like watching how a volcano erupted. First she began to shake in rage, and the others could have sworn, that the earth was shaking too. Then steam seemed to shoot from her nostrils and ears, and her face had gone purple with rage. And then mount Nodoka exploded. "How dare you call my daughter a weak and worthless girl! Haven't you understood a word we said? I promised to give you a repeat performance, should you fall back into your misogynistic tendencies, and you know what? You just earned yourself one!"</p><p><b></b>Genma backed away and began to stutter. His misogynistic mind caught on to the fact, that he might have overdone it a bit. But he was right! Their strong and manly son could not live as a weak, honourless and silly little girl! That was not, what he had formed his son into! So why was Nodoka so angry at him? Damn, one could think that Nodoka even loved the despiseable girl-side of their son.</p><p><b></b>One look at his wife told him, that his life-expectancy was running rather short. And the gleam in Nodokas eyes told him, that whatever Nodoka had in mind for him would be rather painful. In all honesty, he had never seen Nodoka so pissed, and he had all reason to think, that he was a dead man. Funny, for Nodoka thought the same thing. "Husband," she said in a scary and cold voice, which promised untold volumes of pain, "Follow me into the Dojo. It is time, that I reeducate you on your conviction concerning women, including our daughter." Then she turned towards Soun and Nabiki. "You two better stay here, for this might get ugly." she said with something akin to barely suppressed glee.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome patriarch gulped, while he was led towards the Dojo by the ear. He did not even think to attempt the crouch of the wild tiger or use the Umi-senken. When Nodoka was like this, she was unstoppable. With a sigh he admitted himself to fate, while Nabiki snickered in a gleeful way, and Soun shook his head at the stupidity of his friend.</p><p><b></b>Soon loud noises emerged from the Dojo, among them a very frequent "Itte!" from Genma, swishing sounds, and yelps of pain, which were followed by the occasional order "to face his punishment like the man you pretend to be!". Yes, one could hear, that Nodoka was having fun in reeducating Genma…</p><p><b></b>It took Genma till the late evening, before he had recovered enough to drag himself out of the guest room to show his face downstairs. Nodoka instantly glared at him, and fingered her Katana. Genma, who was covered in thick, obviously self-applied bandages that enveloped him from head to toe, gulped and sat down a good distance away.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki was suppressing her giggles with medium success, and instantly had the creative idea, to accidentally spill some of her water on the 'mummy'. It surely would be fun to watch, how those bandages ensnared the big oaf of a panda. Obviously Nodoka had had the same idea, for as Genma passed by his wife in a slow hobble, she accidentally knocked her own glass of water over, and that it spilled over his feet was enough to trigger the change.</p><p><b></b>The immediate result was an instant panda-mummy, and would anyone from a film-crew have seen Genma as a panda-mummy, they would instantly have hired him for an omake. The panda himself found the situation anything but funny, as those stupid tight bandages made it difficult for him to breathe. Finally, when the panda started turning blue, Soun took some pity on his old friend, and restored him to human form.</p><p><b></b>During the meal that followed one hour later, Genma tried his best to avoid cold liquids, and he mostly succeeded due to the fact, that he was sitting far away from Nodoka and Nabiki, who had both found great fun in spilling cold liquids on him. All purely accidentally, of course.</p><p><b></b>After the meal, Genma rubbed his fat belly and sighed. Silently he muttered something about "stupid katana-happy women", "worthless girls" in general and "how he was cursed with a weak and dishonourable son, and that after the good job he had done as a parent". Genma was apparently convinced, that he had muttered silently enough. To his eternally bad luck, both Nodoka and Nabiki had very good ears.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka was instantly incensed once more, and her conviction, that her husband needed obviously several repeat performances before the teachings of his master had been driven out, grew. She was just about to unsheathe her katana and throw a rage-fit, but surprisingly Nabiki beat her to it.</p><p><b></b>She knew everything about how Genma had 'raised' Ranma, and now she lost her temper with 'uncle'. Even her cool countenance could take so much. "You call the upbringing Ranma had actually raising a child? I'd call it permanent child abuse! How often did you sell Ranma when he was little? Countless times! One time even for some rice, two fish and pickles! And what would you know about honour anyway? Ranma is a thousand times more honourable than you, even when he's in girl-form! You and your attitude towards women in general, and towards Ranma when he's and she in special, you disgust me!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka was actually tempted to applaud Nabiki, but some of the feeling of duty she still felt towards her husband kept her from doing so. Thus she limited herself to a proud nod. Genma on the other hand, seemed to be taken aback. Slowly his head turned towards the Tendo patriarch. "Soun, how can you let your daughter talk like this towards an honoured guest? Doesn't she know any manners?"</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter steamed at this and was about to retort when Soun answered. "Why should I correct my daughter when she is right? I only realised it shortly, but Ranma has always acted honourable, regardless of the form. And while I myself may not have acted honourable in the past ten years, I have to admit, that she has a point. Which honourable parent sells their child for food, Genma? Not even our master would have stooped so low. And while I myself am not overly fond of the idea, that my Kasumi will spend three or more months away, and as a man to boot, I have to admit that it makes sense. How should those two get used to their curses in a place like Nerima? And how should that work with the constant danger of changing forms? I agree with Nodoka. It would be the best, if those two liked each other in both forms. And now behave like an honoured guest, and apologise to your wife and my daughter."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smiled proudly at her father, and even Nodoka looked pleased by Soun's words, and she fingered her katana to emphasise the point, that they were waiting for an answer. Genma obviously struggled with the concept of a Soun who was not firmly on his side. How could that be? Had the whole world turned against him? "Nodoka, you wanted a manly son and I raised a manly son. That I had to go to some length in the name of the greater good is understandable. After all, the true martial artists' path is fraught with peril. So I had to sell Ranma a few times in order to keep us fed, and maybe I engaged him for food. So what? It was all in the name of training! I was the one, who made Ranma into what he is now! The very best martial artist there is! My son is the best fighter, and no weak and silly little girl! And I know nothing of the 'abuse' Nabiki spoke off. That is ridiculous!" he claimed. "Therefore I have nothing to apologise for!"</p><p><b></b>Mount Nodoka had begun to steam once more, and also Nabiki struggled visibly for control at being called a liar, even if 'uncle' had only implied it. The middle Tendo daughter forced herself into her Ice Queen persona once more, and seconds later a smirk crossed her features, as she remembered one trump card she had never played out until now.</p><p><b></b>But never before had she been so angry with the darn freeloader. "So you say that I am lying, is that it? You say, that you did not put your son through abuse, eh, 'uncle'?" she asked, and pronounced the last word, as if it tasted like the worst of Akane's cooking.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome patriarch nodded self-confidently. "I never put my son through any abuse. All that I did was for training purposes, and his path to the top was occasionally rocky. But my son always came out on top."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki's smirk grew. "Always, eh, 'uncle'? Hmm, let me think about it…" she said, and put her right hand to her chin while she displayed the classical portray of the thinker, "Actually, what about a certain training you put him through? When Ranma was six years old? Did he come out on top there and then?" she asked fake-pleasantly.</p><p><b></b>Now Genma began to sweat bullets. His No-chan still had no idea of the Neko-ken and the training involved. If she ever found out, his days were numbered! Thus he hasted forwards, and tried to press a hand over Nabiki's mouth to keep her from telling more, but his progress was suddenly blocked by something steely.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka had moved faster than anyone had seen, and her katana was already drawn. "Dearest, I have already enough reason to make a panda fur-rug out of you. If you so much as touch Nabiki, you will wish, that you had never been born. Now I want to hear, what she has to say while you stay put. Have I made myself clear?"</p><p><b></b>In face of the icy cold and steely glare of his wife and the very sharp steel in her hands, Genma could do nothing more but nod dumbly, well knowing that his day of judgement was approaching fast. Under the watchful eyes of the others, Genma did the sensible thing; at least in his opinion. He upended a glass of water over his head and became a panda.</p><p><b></b>A panda, who tried to look cute and innocent. Seemingly nobody had told Genma, that pandas with a character like his <i>never</i> looked cute or innocent, but just plain stupid when they tried to do so. # <i>I am just a cute panda.</i> # Flip. # <i>Pandas are an endangered species.</i> # Flip. # <i>So don't hurt me, whatever she says!</i> #</p><p><b></b>Grinning to herself in face of the fate that awaited Genma, Nabiki began to relate the story of the Neko-ken. During the tale Nodoka blanched progressively, and asked repeatedly "He did <i>that</i> to my Ranma?", and when Nabiki had ended by describing the effects of the Neko-ken, Nodoka was more furious than ever.</p><p><b></b>Slowly, she stood up from the chair she had been sitting on during the tale, and this time it was positive that fire was gleaming in her eyes. Her katana seemed to achieve a life of its own as it weaved complex patterns through the air by a focused Nodoka. Her stare was solely fixated or her quivering husband. "So, dearest," she began in a cold tone, "you signed I shouldn't hurt you regardless what Nabiki had to say, hmm? Well, what do you have to say for yourself? I don't have to ask if this is the truth, for I trust Nabiki, and I know you. What was going on in that obviously limited mind of yours to put our child through this… torture?"</p><p><b></b>Genma sweated blood by now, and not even his panda-form managed to hide the signs of fear. # <i>B… but No-chan… </i># he signed, but was interrupted by a growl from Nodoka.<br/>"Don't you No-chan me, neither now or ever. At the moment I am undecided, if I just kill you and be done with it, or if I torture you before. So explain yourself, so that I can decide on your punishment, dearest."</p><p><b></b>The panda did not like the choices presented to him, and really considered either employing the Saotome final technique or the crouch of the wild tiger. But the purpose of the latter was defeated by the fact, that he was currently a panda, and signing 'I am sorry!' repeatedly, while grovelling at her feet was not as impressive as in human form. But the cold stare of his furious wife had him rooted to the spot. Maybe if he was allowed to turn back…# <i>I will tell you. But first of all, let me change back.</i> #he signed.</p><p><b></b>Soun shook his head at his friends' antics. He was sure, that Genma would use the crouch of the wild tiger as soon as he was back in human form. But the Tendo patriarch figured, that Genma had forgotten one variable: Nodoka was not the master. The master could be begged for forgiveness, but Soun doubted, that it would work with Nodoka. She was far too furious at the moment, and, most important, Genma had done something really stupid to her child. And there's no fury worse than that of a mother.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Nabiki had heated water, and this simple act was a special treat for her. "Here 'uncle', for you only 5,000 yen. Fair price, isn't it?" she said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>The pandafied Genma growfed and growled, but couldn't really say anything. # <i>Put it on my tab.</i> # he signed.</p><p><b></b>The smirk grew. "Your tab just expired. Either you pay me after you've turned back again, or you'll stay a panda. Deal?"</p><p><b></b>Panda-man gruffed, but didn't really have a choice in the matter. He needed to be human, for only in this form the crouch of the wild tiger would be convincing. And it had other plus-sides, for as a human, he could as well run faster <i>and</i> he could use the Umi-senken.</p><p><b></b>Okay, the latter wouldn't be of much help against Nodoka, as he had come to know so painfully all those years ago, but those were advantages worth paying for. Also, he'd get the money back from his worthless son once the schools were united and he would be in control of the dojos finances. # <i>Deal.</i> # he signed.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smirked once more. "And remember that I have witnesses, 'uncle'. No backing out of the deal, or you won't like the consequences. For example, I might be forced to tell auntie about a certain guidebook, and someone I know who could not read it. Comprende?"</p><p><b></b>The Panda sweated, then growfed. # <i>Agreed. No backing out.</i> #</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter savoured, what she was about to do now. After dealing with two curse-victims on a regular basis for over a year now, she knew that warm water was more than enough to restore them to birthform, but what was coming now Genma literally had coming. Nabiki took the kettle from the stove, and upended it over the Panda.</p><p><b></b>Seconds later a yelping Genma was jumping around the living room. "Hot! Hot! Hot! Itte!" he yelled, fanning himself with his hands, "Damn, it needn't be <i>that</i> hot!" he exclaimed disgruntled.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki looked at Nodoka, and both women barely hid their smirks. That had indeed been part of a well-deserved punishment. After Genma had collected himself somewhat, Nabiki held out her hand. The Saotome patriarch grumbled and reached into his gi, from where he produced a sufficient amount of yen.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter made a sport of counting the money as slowly as possible. Finally she nodded satisfied. "Good, 'uncle'. See, that wasn't so hard, was it?" she asked with an amused smirk.</p><p><b></b>Genma grumbled something under his breath, but stopped instantly when he felt the steely gaze of his wife on him. "Now tell me what you were thinking, when you taught my child the Neko-ken, husband. And pray, that your explanation is to my liking."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome patriarch gulped. Then he sat down onto the couch, and sent a quick prayer to Kami-sama. Usually he was not into this funk, but maybe it helped? "Well, it all started when I got my hands on this training manual, which promised to make the user into a nearly unstoppable fighting machine. And as I wanted our son to be the very best there is, I taught it to him. Okay, the method was a bit rough, I admit that, but how should I have known, that the boy would go insane from it and would be deathly afraid of cats? I couldn't have known, No-chan, believe me!"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki snorted, and Nodoka looked at her. "Do you disagree, Nabiki?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Said Nabiki nodded. "Most certainly, auntie." she said, well aware, that she'd probably deliver the last nail to Genma's coffin. But after what he had done to Ranma, he deserved it. "Had 'uncle' read the next side of the manual, he would have seen the big, fat warning that warned anyone who wanted to teach the technique of the Neko-ken, that the trainee would either die due to the procedure or become hopelessly insane." She took a deep breath, and meanwhile Nodoka gaze had turned from steely to hellfiery. "That Ranma has survived with his sanity intact is a miracle, auntie. But it is still very dangerous for Ranma to be around cats for a prolonged time, as this will trigger the state of the Neko-ken."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka turned a pair of fiery eyes on her husband. "IS THIS TRUE, GENMA?" she asked in a cold rage, which made Genma shake in fear like a leaf in the wind.</p><p><b></b>Genma had no other choice, thus he nodded meekly. "Yes. But the two sides of the manual were glued together, and I did not bother with them. And all in all, it isn't too bad. So the boy is afraid of cats. And? That does not make the boy less of a man."</p><p><b></b>His wife steamed. "Haven't you understood it yet, Genma? Ranma's manliness does not interest me anymore. The most important thing is the well-being and the happiness of my child, and you endangered it greatly. I honestly don 't know, what I'll do to you, Genma, but you can count on another private chat in the Dojo." While Genma gulped Nodoka turned to Nabiki. "Nabiki, is there anything else I should know about the Neko-ken?"</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter thought for a moment, then she nodded. "Well, 'uncle' actually succeeded, at least somewhat. As said, I have witnessed the Neko-ken, and Ranma slips into this state, when he or she is exposed to a cat for too long a time. Then Ranma turns into a cat in mind, and actually acts like a cat would. Only that this cat has three feet long ki-claws, which can cut through just about anything. Ranma is out of control in this state, and handles anything that he or she perceives as a threat accordingly. Because of the Neko-ken Ranma is a bomb whichs' fuse is constantly lit, and I dearly hope, that Ranma will find a way to either get rid of it, or to control it."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka had blanched throughout Nabiki's explanation. Once she had gathered her bearings again, she rounded in on her husband. "Genma, the Dojo! Now! And pray that I let you live to see the next day! I can't believe your stupidity, and it seems as if I have to force it out of you! Now move it!" she yelled into his face.</p><p><b></b>Genma had now the physical size of the metaphorical mouse, and was forced towards the Dojo with the Katana pressed into his back. The sounds that followed soon afterwards were a lot more intense than before, and Nabiki actually grimaced at a particularly loud scream of Genma.</p><p><b></b>Soun just shrugged. What had happened had been bound to happen sooner or later, but at least it looked as if Nodoka would let Genma live. Which was a good thing, for nobody else gave him a decent challenge at Go. Both Tendos ignored the sounds coming from the Dojo, as Nabiki read the part of the paper which interested her the most, namely the stock market, while Soun read the rest.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly particularly loud yelling could be heard, and Nabiki and Soun looked up. "FROM NOW ON YOU'RE EXEMPT FROM EACH AND ANY DECISION PERTAINING OUR CHILD! AND SHOULD OUR CHILD HAVE CHILDREN, WHICH I HOPE, THEN YOU WON'T HAVE A SAY IN THEIR UPBRINGING EITHER! YOU HAVE PROVEN TO BE UNFIT AS A PARENT, AND FROM NOW ON RANMA'S EDUCATION AND FURTHER UPBRINGING WILL CONCERN ONLY ME!"</p><p><b></b>"B… but No-chan, you can't do that! I haven't taught the boy all I know yet, and besides, you aren't allowed to exclude me!" Genma said a bit more self-confidently. "I am the Head of the Clan Saotome, and you can't overrule the Head of Clan!" he finished with something that sounded suspiciously like glee. Bad idea, Genma. <i>Very</i> bad idea.</p><p><b></b>Soun and Nabiki cringed away when they heard Nodoka snarl. Loudly. "YOU! YOU STILL THINK THAT YOU ARE THE HEAD OF THE CLAN SAOTOME, A CLAN WHICHS HONOUR YOU SHOT BEYOND REPAIR? YOU IDIOT LEFT ME OVER TEN YEARS AGO, AND YOU LEFT ME TO DEAL WITH EVERYTHING THAT PERTAINED THE CLAN! AND AFTER TEN YEARS OF ACTING AS THE HEAD OF CLAN I <i>BECAME</i> THE HEAD OF CLAN! I'LL REPEAT IT ONLY ONCE: YOU HAVE NO SAY ANYMORE! YOU LOST IT, WHEN YOU TORTURED OUR CHILD! AND NOW HOLD STILL AND TAKE YOUR PUNISHMENT LIKE A MAN!"</p><p><b></b>"HAH! AND YOURE A FIT PARENT, HUH? <i>WHO</i> LET RANMA RUN OFF WITH ME AND <i>WHO</i> NEARLY HELD US TO THE SEPPUKU CONTRACT? Genma yelled back, and a deathly quiet ensued. Suddenly, a tiny and barely audible "Oops" could be heard from Genma, before sounds ensued which indicated, that someone was chased and beaten upon.</p><p><b></b>Then suddenly… "HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT! IT WAS <i>YOU</i>, WHO WANTED TO TAKE RANMA ONTO THE STUPID TRIP AT ALL COSTS! IT WAS <i>YOU</i>, WHO SUGGESTED THE CONTRACT AND PRACTICALLY FORCED IT DOWN MY THROAT! FOR TEN YEARS I HAD NOTHING MORE THAN A STUPID PIECE OF PAPER TO REMIND ME OF MY SON! DO YOU THINK THAT MADE ME HAPPY? I ONLY AGREED TO THE STUPID IDEA OF THE CONTRACT BECAUSE I DEARLY HOPED IT WOULD KEEP YOU IN LINE! SOMETHING THAT FAILED ROYALLY! DO YOU THINK, I WOULD HAVE LET RANMA GO IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT YOU CONSIDERED TRAINING? KAMI-SAMA, IT IS A TRUE MIRACLE THAT OUR CHILD IS EVEN ALIVE, NOT TO MENTION SANE! AND THAT MY RANMA TURNED OUT AS WELL AS HE HAS IS NOT YOUR MERIT AT ALL! I HAVE MADE MY SHARE OF FAULTS, THAT I ADMIT, BUT WHAT YOU DID TAKES THE CAKE! AND NOW IN THE NAME OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HOLY I WILL PUNISH YOU!"</p><p><b></b>Inside the living room, Nabiki whistled. It seemed, that 'uncle' was receiving a really good dressing down, something he deserved for the longest time. Ever since her attitude towards Ranma had changed, she had come to see, that a lot that had happened around here had been Genma's fault.</p><p><b></b>Had the big oaf not held back information during critical situations, and that repeatedly, a lot could have been prevented. And all of Genma's harpings about honour were the biggest joke ever! Ranma had been right, Genma Saotome would not know honour if it bit him in his furry butt. Repeatedly. <b>'You go, auntie. You show that baka. And beat him one over from me too!'</b> Nabiki thought with satisfaction.</p><p><b></b>Moments later very loud noises followed the latest outburst of Nodoka, and Nabiki produced two sets of ear-plugs from her pocket, smirking all the while. After the first session she had grown wiser, and now she was prepared. She plucked the ear-plugs where they belonged, and sighed when peace and quiet were re-established. Her father smiled at the smartness of his daughter, and used the other set of ear-plugs for himself. Who knew, how long Nodoka would take with punishing Genma?</p><p><b></b>It turned out that Nodoka had been <i>very</i> angry with Genma, and when Nodoka had finally deemed him punished enough, the Saotome patriarch had barely been able to crawl. With the last of his strength he had dragged himself into the guest room, and he hadn't been seen ever since. That had been yesterday, and presently the Tendos, including Akane, and one Nodoka Saotome were sitting around the breakfast table.</p><p><b></b>School would start in half an hour, and the four were enjoying peace and quiet for once. The sounds of the morning fight between Ranma and Genma had been absent, which had led to a good nights sleep for everyone except Genma. The Saotome patriarch had been in a lot of pain, which had made it impossible for him to sleep at all. Nodoka had refused to share the same room as her husband, and had slept in Kasumi's room.</p><p><b></b>After breakfast, Nodoka accompanied Nabiki to school. She had to withdraw Ranma, and Nabiki would have to prepare for the impact that would have. But not even the prospect of making a lot of Yen with the latest news could cheer the Ice-queen up. Outwardly she had her indifferent mask in place, but inwardly she was in turmoil. What her sister had said had rattled her deeply. Akane had seen their mother! In heaven!</p><p><b></b>And Akane had told it in such a way, that Nabiki had no reason to doubt her. That rattled her worldview quite thoroughly. She had been nearly convinced, that heaven and hell existed after Kasumi had been possessed by that oni, but now she really began to think about adjusting her lifestyle.</p><p><b></b>After all, she had been no choirboy (or girl for that matter), and she wanted to see her mother again after her death. Nodding to herself she came to the conclusion, that Kasumi had been right. Money was not everything, but it could ruin her life and her character. Yes, it was time to change her way of life.</p><p><b></b>In the following half hour, Nabiki helped Nodoka to withdraw Ranma. She also handed in an exculpation for the day for Akane. Her father had finally decided, that Akane needed professional help, and Nabiki had been happy to make an appointment with Dr. Jagakawa. Due to her skills in talking people into what she wanted, she had even managed to make an appointment for today. And until the appointment later today she had aunties word, that she would serve Akane loads of calming tea for her still surging temper.</p><p><b></b>Handing in the exculpation had been easy, but regarding Ranma's withdrawal Principal Kuno aka Principal Coconut turned out to be a harder nut. But with Nabiki's help and Nodoka's threat to sue the school, the idiot had had no other choice but to accept it. He had even cried bitter tears when he had had to hand Ranma's mother the school report for this grade.</p><p><b></b>Unsurprisingly and due to Kasumi's tutoring Ranma had passed. Now Nabiki would have to prepare for the next day, when the student-body would find out what had happened. The only thing Nabiki looked forward to was the profit she would make, probably for the last time, when the school learned of the departure of Ranma Saotome.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
