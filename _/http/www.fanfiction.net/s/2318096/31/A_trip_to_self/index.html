No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is  intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks  mentioned in this story.</p><p>This  story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the  Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter  31: Female troubles and a visit from the lost boy</b></p><p><b></b>Ranma  woke up and was fully alert in an instant. The place she found  herself in was not the bedroom she occupied at the Masakis, and she  asked herself if <i>she</i> had been abducted for a change. Looking  down at herself she found that she was fully clothed, which was very  odd considering that she clearly remembered undressing before going  to bed. Ranma looked around and noticed that she was standing on the  battlefield of earlier. Oddly enough it was as if the battle had  never taken place; the compound was totally unharmed.</p><p><b></b>She  looked around, and suddenly felt the presence of the Android. But  that was impossible! She had destroyed that thing, she was sure! That  could just not be, could it? Damn, she had disintegrated that thing  to the last atom, but there it was standing, a few hundred yards  away, a carbon-copy of Ryoko! How in Kami-samas name was that  possible? It did not make sense!</p><p><b></b>Her  irritation grew further when she suddenly felt someone else. Kasumi!  What in Kami-samas name was <i>he</i> doing here? Shouldn't he be  healing in the reg-tank? Weird. And why was he headed her way, a look  of determination dominant on his face? It looked like he intended to  save her, but she didn´t need any saving here.</p><p><b></b>Then  she saw that the Android had set itself in motion with a cruel smirk  on its face, and she realised with horror where the machine was  headed; her breath caught in her chest. It was directly headed for  Kasumi! And she just knew in her gut that she would not be able to  prevent that in time.</p><p><b></b>She  started to run despite her instinctive knowledge and yelled a warning  at him to look out, to get to safety, hoping against hope that she  could prevent the disaster that was about to unfold.</p><p><b></b>Her  thin hopes shattered when a cruelly smirking Android fired a huge  energy-blast at Kasumi, and in that moment she knew that she had  failed. The blast hit him dead-on, and she could hear his yell of  pain, just like the first time. It was the worst sound she had ever  heard and when she felt his life-energy slipping away she slumped to  the ground, utterly defeated, tears spilling down her cheeks. In this  moment she wanted nothing more than to die herself.</p><p><b></b>She  had not been strong enough, not fast enough, not good enough. Her  father had been right all along. She was a silly, weak little girl. A  weak girl who had allowed that her life-mate, the love of her life,  had been killed. She was worthless. A failure.</p><p><b></b>The  redhead looked directly into the Android's eyes, but instead of rage  she felt despair and defeat. Then the machine was gone as suddenly as  it had appeared, and a weeping Ranma knelt down beside the lifeless  body of her love, whose empty eyes stared at her accusingly, as if to  say '<i>you</i> killed me'.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  awoke from the nightmare with a loud scream. Her heart was beating  like a jackhammer in her ears and sweat was running down her  forehead; a sheen of sweat seemed to cover her whole body, and she  felt warm tears on her cheeks; she felt as if she had just run a  marathon, but with five-ton weights attached to her body and shoes  that weighed a ton each. The redhead started to sit up in bed in an  effort to get a grip on herself when her mother hurried over to her.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka  saw the tears streaming down her daughters' face and did not hesitate  one second. She was at Ranma's side in a flash and embraced her in a  comforting hug, all the while mumbling soothing words into her ear;  she softly stroked her daughter's hair in an effort to calm her down.  "It's alright, honey. It was just a bad dream. Let it all go."  she soothed.</p><p><b></b>The  Saotome matriarch had never seen her child so vulnerable before, but  she had vowed that she would be there for her child, for her daughter  as much as for her son, and by Kami-sama, she would never reprimand  her again for showing human emotions. And Kami-sama help anyone who  tried that! Ranma finally calmed down in her mother's comforting  embrace as Nodoka continued to talk to her in calming and soothing  tones. This was a new experience for Ranma as well as for Nodoka, and  the Saotome matriarch could hardly remember when she had done it for  her son so long ago. To be able to do it for her daughter felt nice.</p><p><b></b>Ranma,  who'd seldom received any affection in her youth, was torn; on the  one hand she loved how her mother was holding and comforting her, but  on the other hand she was worried that she'd lose her independence  by allowing others to care for her. Finally Ranma realised that she  was still clinging to the teachings of her father, the only guideline  she'd had in over ten years.</p><p><b></b>But  now she consciously knew that his teachings outside martial arts were  not suitable for her any more, and in a supreme effort she let  herself fall into her mothers embrace completely. Her tears were  slowly coming to a stop as she realised that everything that had  happened <i>had</i> been a bad dream; once she had realised that she  sighed with heartfelt relief. She tried to get a grip on herself but  found that difficult as her emotions were running rampant. Finally,  with a thankful smile on her face she lowered herself out of her  mother's embrace and onto the pillow.</p><p><b></b>Then,  a bit more relaxed she began to tell her mother the details of her  horrifying nightmare. She was still slightly shaken and really  thankful for her mother's support. Her father would probably have  acted way differently, to put it mildly. Here and now she realised  from whom she'd inherited the 'insensitive gene'...</p><p><b></b>Ranma  marvelled that her mother was so understanding and supportive, and  her love for her grew in leaps and bounds. In the minutes after Ranma  had regained her composure Nodoka had explained to her that it was  only natural for her to feel guilty about what had happened, but that  it was completely illogical to blame herself. Nodoka told her that  she had talked to Washu about what had happened, and if even the  universes' greatest scientist had assured that there had not been  anything she could have done she could very well stop blaming  herself.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka  kissed Ranma's forehead. "It was not your fault, honey. Washu  showed me a recording of the fight"</p><p><b></b>"What?"  Ranma interjected, sitting up and seating herself beside her mother.</p><p><b></b>"Yes,"  Nodoka explained, "after she lost her… what was it called? Ah  yes, sensor-net… after she lost that, she sent a cloaked… I think  she called it 'surveillance-drone' that recorded the fight. I saw  everything, and it was <i>his</i> decision to shield you from the  blast, which was very brave, mind you. But there was not a thing you  could have done, so please stop blaming yourself. It won't do you any  good, honey."</p><p><b></b>"But…  but I was not strong enough to stop that thing from hurting and  nearly killing him! What kind of martial artist am I? Pops was right,  I was too weak to defend him. I'm a disgrace." she muttered and  lowered her head.</p><p><b></b>Her  mother was having none of it, and Ranma was surprised when Nodoka  produced a battle aura. And a very impressive one at that. Moments  later her chin was lifted, and she was forced to look into the eyes  of her mother. Eyes that seemed to be alight with fire. "Ranma  Saotome, now you listen here! You gave your all in this fight, a  fight in which everyone was tossed around like rag dolls by this  machine! You were even willing to sacrifice yourself if that would  have given the others the chance to survive! You sure as hell are <i>not</i>  weak and you're no disgrace! If anyone says otherwise I'll skin them!  You're my child, and I am proud of you! I love you so much, and I  can't believe that I was stupid enough to miss out on you for over  ten years. I'm proud of you, and I'm also proud of Kasumi. He showed  you that he's willing to die for you, and that's the ultimate proof  of love, honey." she said and drew her daughter into another  embrace.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  was so shocked by her mother's speech that she did not react for  several moments. Then she giggled. "Mom, you cursed!" she  exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka  giggled too. "I guess I did, honey. But there are moments in  life when even a lady has to curse to get a point across." she  said and looked into her daughter's blue eyes. "<i>Have</i> you  understood? You're not to blame. That Android was at fault, and you  made it pay. So leave it behind you, and look forward to having him  back." she said and stroked her daughter's back.</p><p><b></b>The  redhead nodded. "I think I see clearer now, mom. Thanks."  she said with another heartfelt smile. Then her face acquired a  determined expression. "I swear I'll teach him how to defend  himself properly, and if it's the last thing I do. I don't want a  repeat of what happened, ever. I'll also ask Washu-chan if she can  design a shield or something for him. With my life he's bound to run  into trouble alongside me." she said with a sigh.</p><p><b></b>Her  mother looked into her eyes and sighed too. "Your life is indeed  filled with chaos, honey. I swear I should ask your father if he did  anything stupid to you beside the things that came to light. But that  is for another time. Now you should rest and dream about meeting your  love again in a few days. Good dreams, my child." she said and  placed another kiss onto Ranma's forehead.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  sighed with contentment and leant back into her pillow, adjusted her  blanket and got into her most comfortable position, considering her  weird stomach cramps. She heard her mother say "Sleep tight,  honey." before she drifted off into sleep.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>In  the middle of the night, it was 4.00 a.m. as her wrist-watch told  her, Ranma unexpectedly woke up again, this time with a bloated  feeling and the beginning of a headache. She had the vague feeling  that a trip to the bathroom was called for and got up. <b>'That's a  real odd stomach bug…' </b>she thought to herself as she made her  way to the bathroom. <b>'But at least it was not another nightmare.'</b></p><p><b></b>The  cramps she'd had all day had grown in strength and were now bordering  on real discomfort, and she swore that the headache she had was  turning into a migraine. She'd also felt somewhat disgruntled the  whole day, but had thought that was because her love had nearly been  killed and because of everything that had happened afterwards.</p><p><b></b>Shaking  her head at the chaos that was her life she approached the door that  led to the bathroom. She distantly noticed the ki-signature of her  mother and sensed that she was sleeping soundly in her own  four-poster bed. Smiling slightly about sharing a room with her  mother, and remembering the last time they had with a shudder she  switched the light for the bathroom on and entered; the redhead was  glad that sharing a room with a mother, who had accepted her fully  was way different and felt really good.</p><p><b></b>Once  in the bathroom she surveyed herself in the full-body mirror, but in  the next two minutes she found nothing out of the ordinary about her.  Everything was as it should be, nothing was different from what it  had been after her growth spurt; her face was the same, her curves  too, but what was it with her breasts? They seemed… bigger somehow,  even on her now larger frame, which had served to decrease their  prominence, and they felt more… sensitive? Odd.</p><p><b></b>Grumbling  to herself she went to the loo to mind her business, and due to her  sleepy state she did not notice at first. Then… "oooooOOOHHH  GAWD!" she exclaimed loudly, probably waking up Soun in the  adjacent room.</p><p><b></b>Her  mother was there in a flash as only a concerned mother can manage.  Nodoka found her panting and rather pale redheaded daughter who was  sitting on the loo, staring into her panties… or rather briefs, how  Nodoka noticed on second look.</p><p><b></b>Hmm,  she'd think about appropriate undergarments for her daughter later.  First this crisis, then everything else.<br/>"What  is it, Ranma?" she asked before she noticed why her daughter was  staring at her briefs. Then it dawned. They were blood-soaked which  meant… "I see, daughter." she said in a soothing voice.  "Now remain seated until I come back. Everything is okay."</p><p><b></b>Just  at that moment Soun came barging in, obviously poised for action.  "What is going on here?" he asked, his eyes scanning the  room.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  just blushed deeply, and she was eternally grateful when her mother  stepped out of the bathroom, effectively preventing Soun from seeing  her. "Soun," she heard her mother say, "everything is  okay. It's just that a situation has come up that only a mother can  take care of."</p><p><b></b>"If  you say so, Nodoka." she heard Souns' voice. "I bid you a  good night."</p><p><b></b>"The  same to you, Soun." her mother replied. Moments later she  reentered the bathroom and smiled at her daughter in an encouraging  way.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  however looked up at her with tears brimming in her eyes. "<i>Okay</i>?  How can you say that everything is okay, mom? Nothing is okay! I'm a  guy and guys ain't bleedin' down there!" she exclaimed,  effectively stopping her mother from exiting the bathroom.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka  came over to her again and smiled, then hugged her daughter. "It's  absolutely normal for a <i>girl</i>, dear. Or rather a woman. And  that you are in this form, Ranma. A woman. That you bleed 'down  there' is nothing to be ashamed of; rather it is the most natural and  normal thing in the world."</p><p><b></b>Her  daughter looked miserable. "But I'm a guy, mom!" she  wailed.</p><p><b></b>Her  mother took her chin in her hand and forced her to look up. "I  thought we had established that you're my daughter as much as my son,  dear. Your period <i>proves</i> that you're every bit my daughter as  you're my son. You're a real woman now, daughter."</p><p><b></b>Her  mother's words sunk in slowly, and reality dealt her up till now  primarily masculine self a severe blow. Guys did indeed not bleed  down there; therefore she was no guy; not wholly and at least not in  this form. But what was she? She did not know as of yet. All that she  knew was that she was utterly confused. Up till now she'd been sure  that there was not much to the concept that she was as much female as  male. Sure, she'd accepted that this body would be with her until the  day she died, but deep down it had still been somewhat like looking  into a funhouse mirror.</p><p><b></b>But  now she was not so certain any more as the knowledge of what had  happened - what <i>was</i> happening to her - integrated into her and  overrid the reservations she'd still had against the idea of being  both sides of the coin. What was currently happening to her, what she  was going through - the bleeding, the cramps and twitches, the  migraine and so on - all that simply did not happen to the male part  of the species. Not to anyone she knew of or had heard about, at any  rate.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  grew ghostly pale once more as she realised what her having her  period meant. She was a real girl in body. A woman; this was not like  looking into a fun-house mirror any more, the situation had changed.  She really was a bloody, bleeding female, and that quite literally at  the moment. She sobbed softly and barely noticed that her mother  swept her into a comforting embrace.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Nodoka  on her part knew what Ranma was going through, or had at least a very  strong guess, for she had had some time to think about it. She had  been sure that her son-turned-daughter <i>would</i> get her period,  as Elder Cologne had been very convincing on the part that Jusenkyo  victims really turned into fully functional exemplars of what had  drowned in the peculiar springs.</p><p><b></b>She  also knew that the case of her daughter was different from any other  girl in the world; her daughter had not been born a girl, and thus  she'd never gone through a typical puberty like all the other girls  in the world had. Jusenkyo had heaved all changes upon her in a  moments notice when she had been cursed, and she'd had virtually no  time to get used to it. One moment she had been a male, and the next  moment after she'd impacted the spring she'd been the polar opposite  of what she'd been before.</p><p><b></b>It  had especially not helped that her husband had raised Ranma into a  young man who looked down upon women; this and Genma's attitude  towards women had ensured that her child had never accepted the  curse. She could just vividly imagine how Genma had demanded that her  child change back any time Ranma had been changed into a she. And <i>she</i>  had been as guilty herself what with the contract and her efforts to  insist on her child being manly at each and every occasion,  regardless of the gender.</p><p><b></b>But  that would change now, and it had already changed. Her <i>daughter</i>  needed her support now, needed to find herself, and she was glad that  she could be there for her, unlike in the past and especially during  the training trip; normally Kasumi would have been able to help Ranma  through what she was going through, but as the oldest Tendo child and  love of her child was currently prevented from doing so <i>she</i>  had the honour to help her daughter. And it was indeed an honour to  help her child through a difficult time; she'd missed out on so much  in her childs' life thanks to Genma and her own stupidity, and she  vowed that she'd never repeat her mistakes.</p><p><b></b>Softly  stroking her daughters' hair she spoke some soft nonsense into her  ear and Ranma slowly began to calm down. Nodoka still marvelled at  how her son had also become her daughter; but now after she'd let go  of her old convictions she could cherish and love her new daughter as  much as her son. She had to marvel though at the complete physical  change induced by the Jusenkyo magic; it was mind-boggling, but that  was what made up magic, Nodoka mused.</p><p><b></b>At  Jusenkyo her child had undergone a complete physical transformation  aside from one aspect, all at once. Now that aspect had caught up and  Ranma had become a real full-blossomed woman. It was safe to assume  that this had dealt a severe psychological blow to Ranma, and she  could only imagine the hell her daughter was currently going through.  Her hormones were probably wrecking havoc on her at present, and the  all too familiar discomfort of a period that every adolescent female  on the planet had experienced was probably a very alien feeling to  her.</p><p><b></b>It  would be a hard time for her daughter, but if handled correctly it  could also lead to growth, maybe even to her accepting her femininity  completely. That the period <i>had</i> occurred was a severe blow to  her child's masculine self image in and on itself, but now the real  work on how to be a girl would and could begin.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>After  Ranma had calmed down enough her mother handed her a selection of  female hygiene products and a pair of plain cotton panties. Due to  the fact that the Saotome girl had had some time to get used to the  idea of wearing panties she only shuddered briefly. With a defeated  expression she took a simple sanitary towel and the panties. After  using the shower and a thorough cleaning she put the sanitary towel  in place with the help of her mother and put the panties on.</p><p><b></b>Even  in her agitated state she noticed that the panties were a snug fit  around her private area and surprisingly she didn't even notice the  sanitary towel much, which was a good thing. After she was properly  attired she gulped down two Midol and put on a determined expression;  she'd face this head-on, and Ranma Saotome never lost. So she was a  real girl and she had her period. So what? Big deal. As her mom had  said on one occasion, billions of women were going through that on a  regular basis and now she too. This was nothing she could not handle;  and besides, her mother accepted her like she was and was helping her  in any way she could, and she loved the feeling of support and  encouragement her mother was giving her.</p><p><b></b>She  was really happy that her mother was so helpful and loving; it was a  far-cry compared to the scary katana-carrying woman from whom she had  hidden several months ago. Sure, her mom had been nice, but scary  nevertheless. But that had changed tremendously. She had to smile  inadvertedly as she walked towards her bed, a worried mother trailing  behind her.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka  blanketed her once she had returned to bed and gave her a kiss on the  forehead. Ranma had to admit that it was a good feeling to have such  a caring mother; this too was a far cry from her upbringing and felt  really nice. As she lay under the covers she mused that her life had  changed a lot lately. And quite very much for the better, even taking  everything that had happened to her and was still happening into  account.</p><p><b></b>The  engagement to Akane had been dissolved after she had really tried  everything to make it work out; but to be fair, she had to admit that  both she and Akane had simply been too immature to have a real  relationship, too prideful and too similar. What they had had between  them had obviously not been enough and it was probably all for the  better that things had happened the way they had.</p><p><b></b>Now  she was united in love with Kasumi, a Kasumi who even had received  the opposite curse of hers due to a twist of fate. They really were  the ideal couple as Kasumi matched her perfectly. Where she was  irritable he was calm, where she was weak he was strong, and the same  was true for their other forms; in essence, they were the opposite of  the other but not so much so that they wouldn't have had enough in  common to have a healthy relationship.</p><p><b></b>How  much she wished that he was here. She really wanted to have him here  with her so that she could snuggle up to him and feel safe and warm…  damn! These female hormones were really affecting her! But on the  other hand, she had learned that there was nothing wrong in seeking  comfort; especially from the person one loved.</p><p><b></b>Never  would she ever deny that she loved Kasumi again. She loved both forms  of her love so much that she really had no idea how she could have  existed without this love up till now. No, she couldn't imagine her  life without Kasumi; the teachings of her father that a martial  artist had to concentrate on nothing but the Art be damned.</p><p><b></b>She  had grasped for herself that it was even okay for one of the best of  martial artists to rely on someone, to love someone. Thanks to Kasumi  and the others here she'd begun to grasp that one could achieve so  much more with support. And if anyone tried to wreck this marvel,  this fairytale that had happened to her then she'd have to set them  straight. She had finally found what had been missing in her life for  so long and may the heavens be merciful on those who tried to take it  away from her…</p><p><b></b>With  these thoughts Ranma slipped into a deep sleep and as the Midol had  taken effect it was not nearly as troubled as she had thought it  would…</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Next  morning Ranma awoke with a slight migraine and the distinct feeling  that she had to use the bathroom. A look at her wrist-watch told her  that she'd slept five hours after her ordeal, which was at least  enough to have had a good nights' sleep.</p><p><b></b>A  look at her mother's bed told her that she was still asleep, which  was no wonder after last night. The implications of what had happened  were still integrating into her and she was slowly coming to grips  with it; she really was a real female in this body, like any other  female on the planet. She had periods and… she could get pregnant.  Damn, Fate really had sprung something at her, hadn't it?</p><p><b></b>Grumbling  to herself she left the bed in a decidedly vindictive mood and  pattered over to the bathroom. She absently switched the lights on,  opened the door and closed it again after she'd entered. Like a few  hours before she first surveyed herself in the full-body mirror after  she'd stripped down to her panties.</p><p><b></b>Aside  from a swelling of her breasts and the churning feeling in her  innards everything seemed to be okay. Her mother had told her in  their 'talk' a few weeks ago that she'd still be able to function  normally which was a relief, yet she'd suggested that she should take  it a bit slower when she'd have her time.</p><p><b></b>Now  this time had arrived and she really hated the thought that she  wouldn't be able to go all out because of her monthlies; now she also  understood why some girls had been excused from PE around a certain  time of the month. Hmm, maybe Washu had a suggestion or two in that  regard, something to allow her to go all out despite her situation.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  then continued to survey herself in the mirror; she was not entirely  satisfied with what she saw. Had she gotten a bigger butt? And she  really didn't like that swelling of her breasts. It made it even  harder to get a good nights sleep and she was very glad that she'd  already gone to sleep as a girl in the past before; the Cats tongue  incident and the Herb incident had ensured that she'd found  comfortable sleeping arrangements for her girl body.</p><p><b></b>But  her butt… she seriously had to do something about it! Then, with a  shake of her head she tried to shoo these thoughts out of said head;  she'd taken pride in her body before but <i>that</i> was ridiculous  and so… feminine! Why should she care about the size of her butt as  long as it did not blow her slacks and still looked cute? There, she  was doing it again! Damn female hormones!</p><p><b></b>Ranma  stopped surveying herself with a sigh and used the loo; she stripped  out of her panties next and conducted her business. The redheaded  girl noticed with a smile that her mother had obviously planned  ahead, for a handful of pads, some plain cotton panties and a package  of Midol were already laying on the sideboard of the bathtub.</p><p><b></b>The  redhead extracted two Midol, filled a glass with water and gulped  them down. Her love had been right; those thingies really helped.  She'd have to thank him properly later. With a smile that was caused  by the thought that her love would soon be able to leave the reg-tank  she entered the shower-cubicle, a large towel already in place. Next  she turned on the water and switched it to hot.</p><p><b></b>Soon  the hot water did her a world of good as it washed away all her kinks  and tensions. She had to admit that it was nice to be able to take a  hot shower in this form. It really felt nice how the hot water met  parts of her that had never had the occasion to enjoy warm or hot  water. During the more than two weeks where she had been locked  courtesy of Herb she had not really been able to enjoy the comforts  of a hot shower. What had happened during the cats tongue incident…  well she didn't even want to go there.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  noticed that the warm water seemed to feel… softer somehow as when  she showered as a male, and she began to understand why females liked  to take a hot bath or shower so much if it felt this good. She'd have  to do that more often…</p><p><b></b>Taking  care to wash herself with water only as had been advised she took  good care to wash all parts of her, especially her private area. She  still thought it gross to be bleeding down there, but that was  apparently a feeling that nearly every female on the planet shared.  As it was thusly nothing special she just ignored it. It was a normal  function of the female body and that she was a real female in this  form she could not deny any longer.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  had to admit that this incident, that she really had a period was  slowly beginning to tip the scales from 'completely male deep down'  to 'maybe I'm both after all?'. If she was honest to herself, she'd  always sensed deep down that this might be the case. Only certain  outside influences like her parents, a certain Seppuku pledge and so  on had always prevented her from accepting this side of her. That and  her stubbornness to always be the macho, the manliest man possible  even when a woman.</p><p><b></b>But  now that she'd really blossomed into a full woman as her mother had  labelled it she'd little choice but to accept this side of herself as  her. This female body was as much Ranma Saotome as her birthform, her  male half. And now it was really time that she started treating this  body thusly.</p><p><b></b>Finishing  the shower she left the shower-cubicle with a new understanding of  herself; the old ghoul had been right. She really had to train this  body, and that just as much as her male form. Granted, she was  tapping a new well of power that was apparently making her ever  stronger but she had to be able to defend herself from  would-be-rapists at any event. Her having her period had impressively  brought home the point that she could indeed get pregnant. If she'd  ever consider such a thing then with only one person…<br/><b>'Damn  was I really thinking that? Holy Kami-sama, I must be more rattled  than I thought…'</b> Ranma mused to herself.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>A  nearly headache-free and freshly attired Ranma entered the bedroom  and found her fully clothed mother already waiting for her, a proud  smile on her face. "Good morning, daughter."</p><p><b></b>Ranma  returned the smile somewhat cautiously. What was her mother so  chipper for? Odd. "Morning, mom. What gives?"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka's  smile deepened and seconds later Ranma found herself in a hug of  astounding strength. "I'm so happy that my little girl has  become a woman!" she gushed.</p><p><b></b>The  smaller redhead scrunched her face up to hide her embarrassment.  "Mooom! I'm not little and I'm…"</p><p><b></b>That  was a far as she got. "Tut, tut, Ranma. Don't even start saying  that you're a guy. Your monthlies clearly prove otherwise. Aside from  that, dear, I learned of how you behaved during that phase were you  thought that you were a complete girl." she said and surveyed  her daughter with a glance.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  had the overwhelming urge to hide under a stone. "Nabiki  couldn't shut her trap, huh? Grand." she muttered. Then she  looked her mother in the eye "But mom, there and then I had hit  my head and had amnesia. So that does not count."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka  shook her head with a smile. "I think otherwise. There and then  you showed that you have the potential to be a normal girl. I don't  say that this was your true self, dear, rather I say you can be as  much a girl as you're a boy. It has been often said before, but you  have to find a balance between your two halves. That you have your  period shows that you're as much female as male; both halves of you  are equally strong, dear, or are now in the process of becoming so.  Both have advantages and disadvantages and now you've to discover  your female half for real, dear, with everything that entails."</p><p><b></b>Ranma  just sighed. "Yes, mom."</p><p><b></b>The  Saotome matriarch smiled. "But at the same time you must help  Kasumi to do the same in reverse. The two of you are in a unique  situation as you're <i>both</i> male and female; Fate has obviously  challenged the two of you to come to terms with it, and its good that  you have each other. Obviously Fate wanted the two of you this way,  thus it makes no sense to deny these halves of you. But I'm confident  that the two of you will come out of it stronger than before. Know  that I'll support you in everything you do, my child. I love you."  she said and gave Ranma a kiss to the forehead.</p><p><b></b>The  Saotome girl was quite happy. Her mother had not used the  'all-girl-incident' against her despite the fact that she could have.  What she'd said had also sounded very logical and all the evidence  was really mounting on her that Fate had wanted her and her love this  way. It was however good to know that her mother would finally  support her fully. "Thanks, mom." she said with a real  smile and hugged her mother who hugged her back with a smile of her  own.</p><p><b></b>The  Saotome matriarch was very proud of her child and she was more than  glad that she had listened to Kasumi a few months back; it had done  her child a world of good that she'd let go of her manliness fixation  for good. "You're welcome, dear." <b>'I've finally  understood that your wishes are more important than what others want  out of you. I will do my utmost to never fall back into the trap of  using you to fulfil my own dreams, my child. But that does not mean  that I can't encourage you subtly so that I'll finally get some  grandchildren…'</b> she thought with a mischievous glint in her  eyes.</p><p><b></b>Their  mother-daughter-hug was suddenly interrupted by a loud grumbling and  Nodoka looked at her sheepishly smiling daughter. "I take it  you're hungry, dear?" she asked with mirth.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  nodded her head. "You could say that, mom."</p><p><b></b>Still  smiling Ranma dressed; the Saotome matriarch noticed that her  daughter had even refrained from using her briefs but that was  probably due to practicability. But even though, they'd really have  to do something regarding her wardrobe. It just did not do for her  daughter to wear such… male attire while she was a girl.</p><p><b></b>At  present she had nothing to criticise seeing as her daughter was  wearing spandex-shorts and a black tank-top which accentuated her  figure very nicely. Had her boyfriend been here he would surely have  drooled over her, there was no doubt; regardless even if Kasumi was  half-female himself he would probably have liked the view very much.</p><p><b></b>But  Nodoka knew that she had to take the renovation of her daughter's  wardrobe slowly. First things first; after all her daughter had lived  through a lot in the last 48 hours and it would not do to ask too  much of Ranma; if she'd learned one thing from her talks with Kasumi  then that her child did not like to be forced, and all attempts to do  so were likely met with stubborn resistance.</p><p><b></b>Once  ready the two Saotome women went down into the kitchen, stopped to  chat some with Sasami, who had made more than enough food for even  Ranma and together the three enjoyed a quiet breakfast, seeing as the  others were still asleep. Only Katsuhito was already up and about and  according to Sasami the old Shinto priest was meditating at the  family shrine. Nodoka, who was understandably eager to chat with her  old sensei nodded at hearing this; she'd wait until he was finished.  After all, she'd waited this long, she could wait a bit longer still.</p><p><b></b>The  Saotome matriarch concentrated on her chat with the second crown  princess of Jurai and told Sasami everything about her daughter's  first period; a delighted Sasami vowed that she´d prepare red  beans and rice to celebrate it appopriately, much to Ranma's eternal  embarrassment. The redhead would have liked nothing more than to sink  into the floor, muttering about a mothers' uncanny ability to  embarrass her child. Only good that there was more than enough food  to brighten her day at least somewhat.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Ranma  left the house after she had helped herself to a sufficient amount of  food, and she had decided to throw herself into a kata or the other  while her mother had remained behind to talk with Sasami. After all,  there was a lot the Saotome matriarch had to be filled in to seeing  as they had only covered the base facts.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka  had known of course that her sensei was of alien descent and she'd  sworn an oath at that time to never reveal that fact, but she was  curious as to what had happened in the lives of the Masakis and the  other residents of the house. She'd known from the start that Ryoko  and Ayeka were aliens, their auras had made that clear. She could  hardly wait to hear what had happened during the ten and more years  that she had not seen her sensei. His life had been very interesting,  as it seemed.</p><p><b></b>While  Nodoka was busy chatting with Sasami her daughter was trying to  incorporate her new powers into the style of Anything Goes. As she'd  surmised in her fight against Ryoko the ability of flight did indeed  take Anything Goes to the next level. Admittedly, she still had to  fine-tune her newest technique, but it was already well-enough  developed to allow her to do some stunning things.</p><p><b></b>Seeing  as their latest enemy had possessed a lot of power and dangerous  skills itself it would really do good to improve a lot further.  Indeed, she now had full access to her new powers but that did not  mean that she had full control over them. Somehow she knew that it  would be a complex task to achieve that. She had become a lot  stronger and more powerful, but she feared that they'd need to be at  their best to survive what was to come. And she could feel it in her  gut that something was to happen in the near future. Something big.</p><p><b></b>But  she would be ready, she <i>had</i> to be. However, the last fight had  made crystal clear that she couldn't continue her lone martial  artist routine in face of the likely opponents, and that meant  working in a team. With Tenchi and his friends; as much as she  normally liked to fight in solitude, she had realised the necessity.  <i>She</i> had let Kasumi down once already, and the love of her life  had nearly been killed for it; her mother could tell her a thousand  times that there hadn't been anything she could have done, but the  truth was, it <i>had</i> been her fault. She had failed, but she  vowed to herself that she'd never fail again, and if training  Tenchi and the others meant increasing these odds then so much  better.</p><p><b></b>She  knew that she'd probably feel guilty forever, that she'd probably  hear his agonised scream until the day she died, but as long as she  had life left in her body she'd fight that something like what had  happened could never recur. Her training helped her focus, made her  forget her guilt for a while, but the pain she carried with her was  just as important, as it served as a valuable lesson: that she was  still human, and always would be, with all the faults and weaknesses  that entailed. It was a sobering insight, but one that had been  necessary. If only the price hadn't been so high…</p><p><b></b>Ranma  threw herself into her katas with renewed vigour and practised each  and every new move she had in her arsenal. The strength of her  energy-blasts had increased but she knew that she had a long way  ahead of her to make them as strong as in her fight against the  Android; there and then she had been ruled by anger, hate and rage  which had given her power far beyond what she had experienced ever  before. She knew now that she had this kind of power, it was only the  question to make it useable under normal circumstances.</p><p><b></b>The  Saotome girl barely noticed that she'd been exercising for over one  and a half hour now and only snapped out of her concentration when  she sensed that Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko were nearing. With a smile  she touched down to the ground and breathed evenly. "Good  morning you three." she greeted with a smile, noticing instantly  that all three were clothed in trainings attire.</p><p><b></b>Various  greetings followed and after a brief discussion they began to spar.  Ranma had chosen Ryoko as a sparring partner while she'd paired up  Tenchi and Ayeka. Today they'd started on working to improve their  defence and seeing that Tenchi was already quite proficient at  defence he could give Ayeka some pointers.</p><p><b></b>Admittedly,  the first crown princess of Jurai had had professional training in  hand to hand but there remained a lot that she had to learn; seeing  that she had been basically useless in the fight against the Android  she'd sworn to herself that she would become stronger and better. And  this determination was exactly what Ranma wanted to see in her  students.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  knew that she had not been a good teacher in the past seeing as she  had failed rather completely in Akane's case; but that had been  Akane's fault just as much as hers. The other girl had always claimed  that she was a good and accomplished martial artist, but honestly,  she had really lacked in technique and style due to the fact that  she'd never been taught more than the basics.</p><p><b></b>Breaking  bricks just did not make you a good martial artist; but sadly Akane  had never realised that and she had never admitted that she needed  help in order to improve; the times were she'd been suped up by the  Super Soba noodles and that strange armour had not helped matters in  the least.</p><p><b></b>But  Ranma on her part had made the mistake to never train Akane seriously  for fear of hurting her; and one of her biggest flaws had been her  inability to hit the other girl in training. That she'd also been  unwilling to stop Akane from walking all over her at all times due to  her feelings for the Tendo girl had also not helped matters as it has  eroded any possible respect Akane could have had for her as a sensei.  Fact was that she had failed where the training of Akane was  concerned.</p><p><b></b>Even  pulled punches would probably have been enough to show Akane that she  needed to improve and it would probably even have shown her that she  did take her seriously. But sadly she'd been too set in her ways back  then to jump over her own shadow. Sadly that could not be changed any  more but she'd vowed to herself that she'd not repeat the mistakes  she had made. She'd never claimed to be a martial arts teacher, had  she?</p><p><b></b>But  she vowed that she'd do her best and utmost to teach Tenchi, Ryoko  and Ayeka all that she knew, even if she still had way to go before  she'd be an accomplished sensei. But she'd learned from the past and  she vowed to be the best sensei she could be. It also helped big time  that Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko could more than take what she could dish  out, and not having to hold back was a relief.</p><p><b></b>Currently  Ryoko and she were involved in an all-out fight and Ranma had to give  it to Ryoko, the other girl had talent; but her deff was sorely  lacking. In fact it was her weakest spot, but due to the pointers  Ranma gave her she was already improving; it was also good to see  that the cyan-haired girl did not overly repeat the same mistakes she  had made during their last sparring match. That was also due to the  fact that Ryoko had realised herself that she could be placed in  situations where her extraordinary toughness would not be enough; in  essence, Ryoko had accepted Ranma as her sensei, as had Tenchi and  Ayeka.</p><p><b></b>Said  two teens were ahead of Ryoko in regards of their deff, but even in  their cases there was still loads of room for improvement. Ranma was  just busy with instructing the two while Ryoko watched and learned  when her head suddenly jerked up. Through their connection her mother  had told her that they had had a security breach… again.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko  just wanted to breach the news when a distinct battle-cry rang out.  "RANMA SAOTOME, PREPARE TO DIE!"</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Four  heads whipped into the direction from where the battle-cry had  originated but only one was graced with a smile. Ranma was quite  happy to 'hear' from Ryoga, seeing as she had had no time to write  the lost boy as of yet. But her smile faded quickly as she saw  Ryoga's face. The lost boy was obviously very angry at something.  Odd. She could have sworn that she had done nothing to raise his ire  in the past months.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  surveyed the nearing lost boy further and realised that his backpack  was noticeably absent. Indeed he was carrying his ever-present  bamboo-umbrella in his left-hand, but Ryoga without his pack looked…  incomplete. "Hey Ryoga," she greeted, "what's up?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi,  Ayeka and Ryoko exchanged glances. <i>That</i> was Ryoga? Ranma had  told them about the lost boy but why the hell was he here? And why  was he intent on killing Ranma? "Ranma, is everything alright? I  thought you two were friends now." Tenchi stated, not knowing  that this was Ryogas standard greeting to begin a fight.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  nodded and was about to answer when Ryoga shouted "RANMA!  BECAUSE OF YOU I'VE SEEN HELL!"</p><p><b></b>The  Saotome girl looked puzzled for a moment, then she shrugged. "Seems  as if he needs a friendly match to vent. I'll handle that." she  said confidently.</p><p><b></b>Her  three friends looked at her as if she'd grown a second head. He  needed a 'friendly match'? And they'd thought Nerima had been odd,  but it rather seemed as if most of the people Ranma knew were odd.</p><p><b></b>The  redhead walked over to meet Ryoga and following their usual pattern  Ryoga attacked first. His bamboo umbrella which he had switched to  his right hand thrust out but missed Ranma by several inches.  Snarling Ryoga intensified his attacks but Ranma dodged out of the  way each time and her mood changed in an instant when she realised  that Ryoga was going more than all out.</p><p><b></b>Why  should she allow him to vent at her? What was she? A punching bag for  all the idiots of Nerima and beyond? Even though he was her friend,  she was getting pissed off at Ryoga as she evaded his attacks. The  redhead did not known if her anger was rooted in the hormonal  imbalance due to her period or in the fact that one of her supposed  friends was attacking her for no reason, again; all that she knew was  that her temper was rising and would explode soon. She was sick and  tired of being everyone's scapegoat, and if Ryoga wanted to vent he  could do so in a real sparring match and not in a  try-to-friggin-kill-her-match! No way in hell was she ever going to  be anyones' punching bag again, in no form or way.</p><p><b></b>She  dodged another thrust with a backflip and Ryoga tried to use this to  his favour. Leaping upwards he brought down the umbrella only to have  it blocked by a double-armed block of Ranma's. Feat that surprised  Ryoga quite a lot considering how heavy his umbrella was and  considering how much strength he'd put behind it. The heavy weapon  bent so much during Ranmas block that it was rendered useless and a  surprised Ryoga drew it back.</p><p><b></b>The  lost boy needed to vent his frustrations indeed but one look at  Ranmas face showed that she might not be the usual emotional punching  bag; the redhead looked mightily pissed off and if Ryoga had not  known better he'd have said it looked like raging female anger. Not  unlike how his Akari often looked during that time of the month. This  thought led his thoughts back to his girlfriend and he instantly  began to glow in a sickly green aura. "SHI SHI HOKODAN!" he  exclaimed and shot a beam of depression ki at Ranma.</p><p><b></b>The  pigtailed girl had been on her guard however and had used her  increased strength to jump well clear of Ryoga as soon as he had  shown signs of depression ki; as a counter she had raised her own ki  in the hope that a perfect phoenix orb would be enough to cancel  Ryogas blast.</p><p><b></b>As  soon as the blast had left Ryogas hands Ranma had been ready.  "Perfect phoenix orb!" she yelled and an orange-red ball of  fire blasted towards the depression-blast and an astonished Ryoga  watched with his mouth hanging open. He'd expected that she'd counter  with a Moko Takabisha, which would be easily overwhelmed by the  strength of his depression ki. But as he watched this new attack he  was not so sure.</p><p><b></b>The  two blasts met and annihilated in a huge explosion that sent  shockwaves through the compound. Little Washu, who was busy in her  lab how so often was half-annoyed that she'd been disturbed in her  research, and half-giddy because of all the data her new sensor-net  recorded. Making the decision to lean back and enjoy she materialised  some popcorn and abandoned her latest project in favour of watching  the fight.</p><p><b></b>Two  aliens and one part-alien, currently standing at the sidelines of  said fight, exchanged glances as they watched the fight. This was  only a <i>friendly</i> match? It looked more like Ryoga was trying to  <i>kill</i> Ranma! And as it seemed now, gauging from the look on  their friends' face, vice versa! But knowing their friend she would  not want their interference in her fight, especially if it only was  indeed a 'friendly match'. Thus they could do little more but sit  back and watch the events unfold.</p><p><b></b>Even  before the dust cloud had cleared a pissed off Ranma was upon Ryoga  and rained blows down on him that were taxing even his Breaking point  hardened hide. Seeing the angry fire blazing in her eyes he asked  himself if he should just have asked for help instead of venting his  frustrations on his friend as usual. Usually it wouldn't have been a  problem; they would have fought back and forth until the one with the  problem would have breached the topic once enough steam had been  vented. That had been their modus operandi ever since the months  following the failed wedding. But something was different now.</p><p><b></b>"PERFECT  SHI SHI HOKODAN!" he exclaimed, and fired the large green ovoid  of ki in an attempt to drive Ranma away from him.</p><p><b></b>But  another Perfect Phoenix Orb quickly did way of his attack. "RYOGA  NO BAKA! I AIN'T IN THE FRIGGIN MOOD FOR THIS SHIT!" she yelled  and roasted him with two phoenix orbs in quick succession.</p><p><b>'Damn,  maybe I should've chosen another day to stop by…'</b> a singed  Ryoga thought.</p><p><b></b>As  soon as a snarling Ranma punched his face faster than he could see  Ryoga had the confirmation. Ranma was indeed mightily pissed. The  evident rage on her face and the fire literally dancing in her eyes  would have had even most kami running in fright, and Ryoga gulped.  Something was definitely off about Ranma. She was scary! <b>'One  sec... <i>she</i>… maybe I was right when I compared <i>her</i> to  Akari! Could it be? Could it be this time of the month for <i>her</i>?'</b>  he thought with another gulp as a fiery glowing Ranma approached him,  cracking her knuckles.</p><p><b></b>Panicking  he employed the Bakusai Tenketsu to get some space between them, only  to see that his attack didn't have any effect on the approaching  redhead. <b>'Impossible!'</b> Ryoga thought. <b>'That should have  thrown her backwards like nothing! What has happened to her?'</b> he  asked himself, trying to bring some distance between himself and the  scary and seemingly unstoppable woman Ranma had become.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile,  while Ranma was rounding in on Ryoga, unstoppable like a Tsunami  others were putting the clues together too. Tenchi, who was used to  this kind of behaviour from the other girls in the household even if  not to this extent, was white as the wall as he came to the apparent  conclusion. Drawing a shuddering breath he looked at Ryoko and Ayeka.  "Are you thinking the same? Could it be her time of the month?"</p><p><b></b>The  two girls looked at each other and nodded. "Hell, I thought she  was grumpy because of what happened," Ryoko paused to cringe as  Ranma proceeded to turn Ryoga into a pretzel, "but it was PMS."  she whispered.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi  nodded. "Yeah. Ranma on her period is even scarier than you  two." he said before thinking.</p><p><b></b>"WHAT!"  two now extremely irritated females exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>"Umm,  heh heh, shouldn't we concentrate on the problem at hand?" a  sweating Tenchi asked, hoping that his diversion from his  foot-in-mouth accident would work. "Look she has nearly turned  him into a human pretzel!"</p><p><b></b>"Wow!"  Ryoko exclaimed, looking at the display, and Ayeka looked too.  "Didn't know that the human body could be bended in this way.  You reckon we try this with Ranmas stupid father?"</p><p><b></b>Ayeka  grinned and Tenchi breathed a silent sigh of relief. "It would  be... interesting. And normally the human body <i>can't</i> be bended  this way."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi,  having covered his faux pax up looked worriedly at Ranma, who  continued to mutilate Ryoga. "Uhh, shouldn't we stop her? I  think that poor guy has suffered enough." he said with sympathy.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka  and Ryoko looked at each other, then at Tenchi. Both shook their  heads. "Not yet." said Ayeka. "You would not believe  how cathartic it is to vent during the monthlies. As it is her first  she's allowed some leeway. Besides, Washu-chan can patch him up after  Ranma is through with him. After the behaviour he has displayed he  deserves being taught a lesson."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko  nodded empathically. "You got that right, princess." she  said and continued to watch, wishing she had some popcorn.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi  for his part suppressed a shudder with difficulty. Women could be  really scary if they wanted, and he figured that he'd do well to  remember that Ranma, his best childhood friend, was a highly erratic  and dangerous woman at the moment, and not the buddy he knew from his  childhood. Behaviour towards the contrary might be very detrimental  to his own health, gauging from what she was currently doing to that  poor sod. Shuddering the grandson of Yosho watched one of the most  terrifying things thinkable: a super-powered woman on her monthlies  aka a force of mass destruction.</p><p><b></b>When  Ranma was done ten minutes later she dusted herself off and huffed.  Looking down at Ryoga the thought crossed her mind that she might  have overdone it a little, but it had felt so <i>good</i> to blow off  steam! Had that been the reason why Akane had liked to dish out so  much during a certain time of the month? It would certainly explain a  lot.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Tenchi  and the two alien girls approached Ranma and the moaning human  pretzel cautiously. Tenchi pitied the other boy; his timing for the  attack couldn't have been worse. "I hate to suggest it, but  let's get him to Washu-chan so she can 'depretzel' him. Ryoko, if you  would."</p><p><b></b>The  cyan-haired girl nodded, touched Ryoga on the shoulder (which  elicited a moan of pain) and teleported them to Washus lab. Ayeka  laid a hand on Ranmas shoulder. "Are you okay, Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>Said  Saotome girl shook her head as if to clear it. "Yes. No. Dunno.  Damn, what's wrong with me? Normally I manage to keep my cool but  today... not even the Soul of Ice was able to calm me down."</p><p><b></b>The  first crown-princess of Jurai smiled at the redhead while Tenchi  stayed in the background, deeming it safer for his continued good  health. "This is your first menarche, Ranma, and it's normal  that your hormones are out of control. That it's harder for you is no  wonder considering your history. But believe me, it gets easier over  time." Ayeka said.</p><p><b></b>Ranma  visibly gathered herself and nodded, thankful for the support she  experienced here once again. "I hope so, Ayeka, I hope so. This  whole period-stuff is a lot tougher than I thought and I admit that  my respect for the women around the world went up several notches."  she said and shook her head. "I hardly ever felt so out of  control before and it's very impressive that women manage to go  through this without blowing things up when they're having their  time. Maybe it's a good thing that not every woman can create  ki-blasts, huh?" she jested in an attempt of wry humour.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka  smiled. "Yes, women are a <i>lot</i> stronger than most men  think, even though our strengths are different to that of men."  she said and began leading Ranma towards the house. Tenchi on his  part still remained aloof. "But as I said it will get easier  each time. Consider that your body is undergoing massive changes and  add the stress you had - we had - to it. I found that those  medications called 'Midol' help me greatly when I have my time. Oddly  even better than anything Washu-chan had to offer, much to her  chagrin, I might add. I suggest however that you ask her anyway if  she has something up her sleeve that could aid you."</p><p><b></b>The  pigtailed girl nodded. "Yeah, that's a good idea. Don't wanna  pulverise Tenchi for breathing the wrong way or anything." she  said only half in jest.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi,  who was following them sweated and prayed that Little Washu had some  really good medication in store. Ranma on her monthlies was really  scary and he didn't want to find out if the wings could protect him  from an enraged and hormonal Ranma should she find him wanting.  Following the chatting girls Tenchi could only hope that Ranma, Ayeka  and Ryoko would never have their times at the same time. The world  and especially he would not survive it...</p><p><b>to  be continued</b>...</p><p>Thanks  for reading.
