No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 10: No more (Amazon) chase</b></p><p><b></b>Cologne opened the door cautiously, her staff at the ready. This was Nerima after all, the town of craziness. Who knew who it was?</p><p><b></b>Suddenly a voice called out, startling the old matriarch. "Hello, old ghoul. Nice to see ya still up 'n about!"</p><p><b></b>Cologne suppressed a groan. "Son-in... Ranma. It is not nice to surprise an old woman like that. After all, I'm not 200 any more."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked. "Don't say I frightened ya, old ghoul?"</p><p><b></b>The Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku bristled. "Of course not! You're 295 years too late for that!" she exclaimed and bopped Ranma on the head with her staff. "And now be more respectful!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma rubbed her head briefly and shrugged. Then she composed herself and did what Kasumi wanted of her. To speak normal and composed. "Okay, Elder Cologne. Has it a specific reason why you didn't call me 'son-in-law' any more? I mean come on, you always called me 'son-in-law'. Why stop now?"</p><p><b></b>The Elder grinned. "Best if we discuss this inside, Ranma." she said and made an inviting gesture.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist shrugged once more and followed Cologne through the backdoor inside the Nekohanten, closing the door on her way in.</p><p><b></b>A minute later both had settled down in a booth, and Cologne began to explain. "I have stopped to call you son-in-law because I had the Kiss of Marriage and the Kiss of Death dissolved." she said and literally dropped the bombshell.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was at a loss for words for a moment. Then... "WHAT!" she exclaimed, and that rather loudly. "The chase for me is off after all this time? Just like that?" she asked disbelieving and quite loud.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded to herself. It was a good thing she had given her Xian-Pu the sleeping potion. Even <i>her</i> eardrums hurt, and they had built up a good tolerance over the centuries. "It is true, Ranma. I decided that Shampoo had all the chances to win you as her Airen. The chase is off, for good."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded, obviously pleased to hear this, but at the same time she also looked worried. "But what about Shampoo? Isn't that bad for her? I mean, couldn't she be punished by your people in the village when she returns without me as her Airen? After all, she got punished with the c… c… neko-curse after she failed for the first time! I don't want anything bad happen to her."</p><p><b></b>What Ranma had said warmed Cologne's heart. Her care for others was unprecedented, and in this moment Cologne knew more than ever that she had done the right thing. "Normally, yes." the Elder nodded, "If a warrior fails to win her Airen twice the punishment is either death or being locked in the cursed form the warrior received after the first failure. Which is equal to a death sentence, as no human can bear the thought of living as an animal for the rest of their natural lives. But this is a special case. I argued that one with the power to kill a god should not be forced into a marriage he obviously does not want. Else it could have serious repercussions. In the end I had to exert some of my influence, but the Council was made to see reason. There is, however, one condition."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded. She had expected something like that. There was <i>always</i> a catch. "Shoot, Elder."</p><p><b></b>Cologne schooled her features and made a solemn face. "Saotome Ranma, this one humbly asks you to become an ally of the Joketsuzoku Amazons. As such you will, as will all of your descendents, forever be exempt from the Outsider rules. What is your answer?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma once more felt like she had got hit by a speeding freight-train, this time driven by utter astonishment. It took her some seconds to gather her bearings. Now talk about unexpected! "What does it mean in detail, Elder?" she then asked, trying to play it cool. Soul of ice indeed.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded. She was being respectful. A good sign. "Well, it means that you will help the tribe in a time of need. Should we be attacked, we would call upon you. You don't have to fear that you would get involved in a war of aggression. After what happened at Jusendo, peace treaties have been made between the Musk, the Phoenix people and ourselves. As an ally of the tribe you would also be entitled to learn more of our more... illustrious and powerful techniques. How do you decide, Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist licked her lips. No Kiss of Marriage and Death, no Outsider rules, assistance only in case of need. That did not sound half bad. To be honest, it sounded really good. And new techniques, eh? "I accept, Elder Cologne. However, I want official documents that ya cancelled the Kisses. And also about the ally bit and about anything else ya mentioned."</p><p><b></b>The Elder grinned. Ranma had really gotten sharp. Nodding, she reached into her personal stuff space and pulled the requested documents out. "I have anticipated your request, Ranma. Here." she said and handed her the documents.</p><p><b></b>Ranma took them from Cologne and studied them. Yup. Looked authentic. "You have hereby gained an ally, Elder Cologne." she said, pocketed the documents in her own stuff space (much to Cologne's wonderment) and extended her hand.</p><p><b></b>Cologne took it and shook it. "Welcome to the tribe, Ranma. Even if differently than I had envisioned. Now you only have to sign these papers so I can fax your acceptance to the tribe." she said.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist nodded and took the papers. She studied them thoroughly and found nothing wrong with them. They did not even contain fine-print, only the plain wording<br/><i>'Herewith do I, Saotome Ranma, acknowledge being an ally of the tribe of the Joketsuzoku Amazons with all privileges and duties. I have been informed that as an ally of the tribe I will only be called upon in times of need, specifically if the tribe is under attack by outside forces. I can never be forced into a war of aggression, and no authority within the tribe can order me to. I have further been informed that my family and all my future descendants will be forever exempt from the outsider rules for now and forever.</i></p><p><i>Signed'</i></p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded to herself, signed the document and handed it back to Cologne, who pocketed it and gave her a carbon copy of the text in return. "There, done." the pigtailed girl said. "And I can imagine that you would have liked another way better, but <i>I</i> like it much better this way." she said grinning. "But what about Shampoo? Does she know?"</p><p><b></b>The Matriarch looked sad for a brief moment, and then shook her head. "No, she does not. And it will be very hard on her. She loves you very much, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed. "I know, Elder Cologne, and I wish I could do something about it. But I don't love her. Not like she loves me. Like Ucchan, I love her more like a sister, despite all what the two have done to me and my family. When will ya tell her?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Cologne grimaced. "If it was an option, I would tell her when she is old enough to attain her own seat on the Council. Cause I'd probably be dead by then." she cackled. "But I digress. I have not really decided when I will tell her of the changes, but I feel that the sooner it tell her, the better it will be. I will however give you and Kasumi enough time to erase your tracks completely should she decide to act against my will and continue the pursuit without the consent of the tribe. I will prepare her for the news and hope for the best. But you came for another reason, Ranma. The soap?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned. "The soap. It was decided that Kasumi 'n me will leave tonight before the old farts return and have a chance to ruin everything. That's why I need the soap now."</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded. "Wait a moment, I will be right back." she said and stood up. Some minutes later she came pogoing back into the room, balancing two boxes in her left hand. She placed them on the table before Ranma. "Here you go. It will be suffice to last you one month. Both of you. Do you know where you want to go?"</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist nodded. "Yes." she said. Then she fetched a beer mat from the table and scribbled down her mail-address, which she then handed to Cologne. "Don't let the old farts or anyone else get their hands on this. Nobody aside from Kasumi, Nabiki and my mother even know that I have an e-mail address or that I can work a computer. I trust you with it, for I don't want that the old farts get the idea to hack my acc in order to find out what's going on. I wouldn't put it past the panda. And learning how to work a comp is easy with Anything Goes martial arts computing." she said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded solemnly. "I won't violate your trust, Ranma. As soon as the packages containing the soap arrive I will send a message to this address, and you can write me back where you want the soap delivered to. But now to other matters." she said, and Ranma listened raptly. "What you said is right. You should leave the Tendo Dojo as fast as possible. Before you go to wherever you're traveling to however, I would like to teach you the Bakusai Tenketsu. And I would like to teach Tendo Kasumi some basic defensive moves. What with your life-style I am sure that she will need them." she said and cackled.</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned. She had always wanted to learn the Breaking Point technique. From watching Ryoga using the the Bakusai Tenketsu she had already learned the technique, but she knew that she lacked the hardening part of the training.</p><p><b></b>Which made the Bakusai Tenketsu essentially useless for her, as only the Amazons knew how to harden the body efficiently to resist the disastrous side effects of the Breaking Point technique. Thus she nodded. "That would be great! The best would be if ya'd accompany us for the time I need ta learn the technique. Hmm, but what about Shampoo?" she then asked to herself.</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded. Shampoo could not be left to her own devices. The same applied for Mousse. After some seconds of intense thinking she snatched her fingers. "I have it. I will simply send her on a trip to collect some rare herbs in the mountains of Niigata. And Mousse I'll send away to the next bigger city to stock up or storage, which should keep him busy long enough. I'll leave a note listing what I need and tell them that I had to go and research something. As this is not uncommon for me they will not suspect anything. If you could get Miss Tendo, we could leave."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked. "Good planning. But that can be expected of ya." she said grinning. "Okay, I'll go and get Kasumi. But it might take a while, as we may have to wait for our new ID-cards."</p><p><b></b>Cologne raised a brow at that, but Ranma waved it off. "I'll explain later. But now…"</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist was interrupted before she could finish. "One question, Ranma, why do you wear slacks?" she asked, cackling.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed. "There was this stupid accident with the cold-water-pipe which also destroyed the stove. Now there is apparently no way to change back. And my clothes got wet and nothing would fit my female form. Thus I had to wear slacks."</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded. "If you want you can change back here. I have a spare pair of Chinese clothes from Mousse, and it would be no bother to heat some water."</p><p><b></b>Out of principle Ranma nodded. She had indeed gotten used to the slacks, but she still liked her Chinese clothes better. "That'd be great! Thanks!"</p><p><b></b>Cologne grinned. "My pleasure."</p><p><b></b>Five minutes later Ranma was back in male form and clad in his favourite clothes, and he was more than ready to return to the Tendo Dojo. "Thanks again, Cologne. I'll leave the soap here and return as soon as possible. Till later!" he exclaimed and bounded away.</p><p><b></b>The Elder only shook her head. So young and full of energy. If only she were 200 years younger…</p><p><b></b>It took Ranma only a few minutes to get back to the Tendo Dojo. He had done the rooftop-hopping on autopilot and had thus had enough time to reflect on the newest events. He could not help himself, but he had the distinct impression that his life was improving.</p><p><b></b>He would not be hunted by the Amazons any longer, nor would he get malletted by Akane any more. The reason why he had allowed her to hit him had dissipated into nothingness, and if she should try it again in the future he'd show her the worth of her mallet-attack against a fast and durable target. Now he 'only' had to convince Ukyo that he wanted nothing more than to be her friend.</p><p><b></b>And he had to get the Kuno's to back off. He also had the itsy-bitsy task to get completely used to his curse. He sighed. That were still enough tasks to drive any normal man insane. But that was the key word. 'Normal'. To be honest, he had <i>never</i> done normal.</p><p><b></b>Ranma just jumped onto the roof of the Tendo Dojo when he noticed a black, inconspicuous car entering the street. Which <i>made</i> it suspicious in his book. He watched intently as a man and a woman, both Asians, and clad in black suits, left the car and strode towards the Dojo.</p><p><b></b>He shrugged and landed elegantly in the backyard, from which he entered the house. Kasumi, Nabiki and his mother were sitting on the sofa, apparently watching some soap opera or something. Well, Nabiki was rather reading her newspaper while Kasumi and his mother watched. Interestingly, Kasumi was back in her birthform too. Odd…</p><p><b></b>Then he got a better glimpse of what was running on the ! He had never understood the fascination females developed regarding that... that waste of time that were those corny soap operas. And he hoped that he as a shenever would. With a cough he announced his presence. "Hey all, I'm back. And before I tell you how it went and what happened, we'll be getting visitors."</p><p><b></b>And before anyone could say anything, the bell rang. Kasumi, who was incidentally sitting closest to the door went and opened said door. As Ranma had expected, it were the two suit-clad people he had watched from the roof. "Good evening, how can we help you?" Kasumi asked.</p><p><b></b>The woman answered. "Hello, I'm agent Kyle and this is agent Smith. We are from the Bureau Dealing with Jusenkyo curse Victims." she said, and both showed their passes.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki, who had appeared behind her sister, checked them. "Looks okay. Please come in." she said, although she and the others knew that the names the agents had used to introduce themselves were most probably aliases. But as their passes looked okay there did not seem to be any immediate danger.</p><p><b></b>The two agents nodded. "Thank you." the woman said. "We don't have much time, so we'll make it quick. I guess that you," she pointed at Ranma, "are Ranma Saotome." she said while looking at a small picture in her right hand and comparing it to the man standing before her.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Good." the agent said, "And who of you is Kasumi Tendo?"</p><p><b></b>"That's me." Kasumi said.</p><p><b></b>"Okay. Now I need you to change to your cursed forms to verify your stories. The material we got on you was pretty much convincing, but if you should have lied or falsified information you're in for a lot of trouble." Agent Kyle warned in a no-nonsense tone.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked. "No worries here." he said, grabbed a convenient glass of water and upended it over his head, becoming a she in a matter of seconds.</p><p><b></b>The Agents nodded. The change they had witnessed just now was more than enough visual evidence of a gender-changing curse. Such a bust-line could not be faked in a matter of mere seconds; and there were also the other altered physical aspects to consider, like the loss of height, for example. This was indeed the real thing. "As often as I see that, I must admit that it is always astounding anew. And you, Miss Tendo?" Agent Smith asked.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi only smiled. She used the glass of water she had been drinking from previously and triggered the transformation, becoming male in the process. Nodoka then handed both a towel so that they could dry off the excess water.</p><p><b></b>Agent Kyle nodded. "Looks real enough to me." she said, and Agent Smith nodded. "This one is for you, Miss Saotome, and that one for you, Mr. Tendo. Your maintenance histories have been modified to suit your cursed forms so that you won't have any problems with school or university. The medical reports have also been dealt with. Now the only thing we need from you is an autograph that you have received the ID-cards."</p><p><b></b>Both Ranma and Kasumi-otoko nodded and did as asked. "Thank you very much." they said in unison and bowed.</p><p><b></b>The Agents bowed back. "It was our pleasure. We have to leave now. Good luck!" Agent Kyle said.</p><p><b></b>"Thanks!" both Kasumi-otoko and Ranma said in stereo, looked at each other and shared a smile. The Saotomes and Tendos then accompanied the Agents to the door and watched them leave. Another hurdle had been overcome, and slowly the situation started to look brighter.</p><p><b></b>After the Agents had driven off Ranma, Kasumi-otoko, Nodoka and Nabiki returned into the living room.</p><p><b></b>"And, Ránmā Saotome, how do you feel?" Nabiki asked teasingly.</p><p><b></b>Said Ranma blushed. "Not different than before, to be honest. But I gotta thank you, Nabiki. Thanks for helping me 'n Kasumi." she said and hugged Nabiki spontaneously.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter was surprised at first, but then she hugged Ranma back. "You're welcome, kiddo. As are you, bro." she said towards Kasumi-otoko with a smirk playing in the corner of her mouth.</p><p><b></b>It was funny to tease her sister-turned-brother, and it was just too bad that she couldn't do that in the upcoming months. But she still had other things to keep her occupied, like her temperamental little sister and two stupid old men for example. No, there was no chance that life would get boring, even with Ranma gone.</p><p><b></b>Minutes later they had settled down, and Ranma began to relate the story of what had happened at the Nekohanten. When she had finished, everyone was astonished.</p><p><b></b>"So that means..." began Nodoka.</p><p><b></b>..."that I won't be hunted by the Amazons any longer!" finished Ranma and jumped up with a huge grin plastered on her face. Seconds later she was engulfed in a hug by her mother that could rival an Amazon glomp any time.</p><p><b></b>After the hug had been released, the Tendos felt it prudent to congratulate too. "Nice going, Ranma. Ally of the tribe and the Amazons off of your back, ne? Not bad for a jock." Nabiki joked.</p><p><b></b>"Nabiki!" Kasumi-otoko scolded. "She is no jock!" he exclaimed indignantly. Then he embraced Ranma in a warm hug. "I'm glad for you, Ranma." he said in a soft voice.</p><p><b></b>Neither Nabiki nor Nodoka could deny the feelings that were displayed in this hug. To not see and feel it one had to be blind and deaf. And total insensitive to boot. And dead. And even <i>then</i> it would have been hard to miss. Nodoka nodded softly to herself. Apparently she had been right about those two, even if both would probably deny it at the top of their lungs at the moment.</p><p><b></b>But it would be so nice to see love blossom from this, and the sparks that were literally flying between the two were a very good start. Nodoka grinned at the potential future that might await her child, and she was once more, true to form, hard pressed not to scream 'grandchildren' and do the victory dance.</p><p><b></b>Ranma did not notice any of this. She felt like melting in the comforting hug Kasumi-otoko was giving her. It was just so nice to be held and to share the joy of a shared embrace with someone she really liked. And it was so unlike those forced, one-sided Amazon glomps she had grown to hate in the past months. No, this here she really liked, for it felt so… safe, and warm, and caring. Mmh, if only she could stay like this forever...</p><p><b></b>A cough reminded them that they were not alone in the room, and Nodoka nearly felt like scolding Nabiki for having done so. Those two had looked so lovely and cute together, even if they had been in their cursed forms. But that did not really matter to Nodoka any more; all that mattered after the disaster of the past months was that her child was happy. Which was obviously the case.</p><p><b></b>It was a blushing Ranma and an equally blushing Kasumi-otoko who separated, but obviously very reluctantly.<br/>After that Ranma proceeded to tell the rest, and Nodoka nodded. "I agree with Cologne, Ranma. It is a good idea for Kasumi to learn some martial arts, even if only for protection. And you should leave soon. Who knows when your father and Soun will return?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko nodded. "We'll hafta get some clothes for the time we'll be on the road. You can take some of mine, Kasumi. They should fit ya. And from now on ya'll need boxers, so I'll pack some boxers for ya too. As you came to know, it ain't nice to wear panties when ya change. And we can't use the soap until we have arrived at Tenchi's. He only knows a male Ranma."</p><p><b></b>"Ranma, your language." Kasumi-otoko scolded.</p><p><b></b>"Sorry, Kasumi." Ranma said. Then she sighed. "You know, it is nice that things have been cleared with the Amazons, but there's still the problem with Ukyo. I only see her as my best childhood friend and she is still and always will be nothing more than a friend for me, but she thinks I love her as more than a friend. And because her honour is hanging in the line she'll never give up on her claim on me. What am I gonna do, mom?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Her mother looked thoughtful, and no immediate solution came to her mind. Thus she began to think loudly about the problem, an approach that had helped her ever since she had come to know just how much her husband had fouled up their childs' life.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka stood up and began pacing, while the others watched her. "Hmm, husband promised you to Ukyo Kuonji because of the dowry her father gave him, which was a yattai, if I recall correctly." Ranma nodded, and her mother continued her musings. "And after my stupid oaf of a husband had run away with the yattai and left poor Ukyo behind, her father had the superb idea to declare her as a male. Something you thought her to be from the start anyway. And her status as a male would only be revoked should she succeed in either fulfilling the engagement or in killing both you and your father. Thus she spent more than ten years training in her art, and when she was sixteen she transferred to your highschool and wanted to beat you up. You as the martial artist you are managed to defeat her, but then you told her that she was cute and would have no trouble in finding a husband. Which lead to her falling in love with you, right, my child?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded and sat down; as did Kasumi-otoko, in the seat next to her. After her mother had found out about the other engagements she had filled her in, and it had been a special treat to see her enraged mother hunting down a certain dumb and greedy panda. Any time she thought back she had to suppress her laughter. But that was easy right now, considering the seriousness of the situation. Her own problems regarding a certain engagement had been solved. But her stupid father had left her in an impossible situation, and it would be hard to find a way through which neither of them would lose face or honour.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka continued pacing and mumbled some profanities and curses about her husband, his stupidity, greed and lack of intelligence and integrity in general. "And due to what husband did, namely running away with the dowry, Ukyo has now a claim on you that is as strong as the Tendo claim. Bravo, husband, you managed to create a fine mess." she summarised. "Apropos mess, dear, what is that Neko-ken training you mentioned?" she asked her daughter.</p><p><b></b>The redhead sweated. "Umm… only some training technique that did not work, mom. Let pop tell ya what it was about when he's back. Ain't a good idea if I told ya." she said, hoping to avoid the cataclysmic explosion of rage an explanation of the Neko-ken would provoke in her mother.</p><p><b></b>Said mother nodded slowly, while a dangerous glint appeared in her eyes. "If I asked you if it was something stupid, daughter, and you had only to nod, would you do it? I promise that I won't question you further, but a certain panda <i>will</i> have to answer me."</p><p><b></b>And in the bar where Genma Saotome was presently getting drunk said Genma suddenly began to sneeze, and he asked himself what was going on as a very cold shudder ran over his spine. Something was up, and it did not seem to bode well for him. Shrugging he downed another glass of booze. He'd think about it tomorrow if he remembered it.</p><p><b></b>In the living room of the Tendos' Ranma was torn. On the one hand she did not want to see her father quartered, sliced and shredded to bits, as he was her father after all; but on the other hand her mother had the right to know what stupid pops had done to her. Then she shrugged. After all, nodding couldn't hurt, could it? Not as far as she could tell anyway. "Okay mom. Sounds fair." she said, and subsequently she nodded vigorously.</p><p><b></b>This was all Nodoka had wanted to know. It seemed as if she'd have to sharpen her katana before husband returned. She'd need her choice-weapon in top-condition for the interrogation of the prisoner… ehm, for the questioning of her dear husband.</p><p><b></b>Gauging from the behaviour of her daughter Genma seemed to have done something really stupid. Which was nothing new, but this Neko-ken training seemed to score pretty high in the stupidity index. Anyway, she'd soon find out. "Good, dear. Thank you for the answer. I will… ask your father later." she said and unconsciously cracked her knuckles.</p><p><b></b>Ranma winced, while Nabiki looked positively gleeful at the perspective of Genma getting what was coming for him. Surprisingly even Kasumi-otoko looked somewhat amused, even if he hid it to a certain degree. All in all, the Saotome youth was glad that she didn't have to answer the question, else their plans of going onto the trip might have been interrupted by the murder of one Genma Saotome at the hands of his wife. <b>'Only good that I'll be away when mom will 'question' pop. That could turn ugly…'</b> she thought.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Nodoka had suppressed the several different ways of how to prolong someones' pain she'd mentally recited and concentrated on the problem that the other engagement presented. "Where was I? Oh yes, thanks to husband the Kuonji claim is as strong as the Tendo claim. And Ukyo has to either kill husband and you or she has to marry you, else she'll lose what is left of her honour and will never be allowed to live as a woman ever again." she summarised. Then she made a disgruntled face. "Genma, you are a first-class idiot! The only thing that comes to mind is to scrutinise if the Kuonji claim has any weaknesses. What exactly happened to the dowry after your father ran off with it, dear?"</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girl grimaced. "After it had lost its usefulness to pop he hid it somewhere in some cavern, but I really dunno if I'd be able to find it again. But aside from that, Ukyo had already lost her dowry to the Gambling King before stupid pop ever stole it; which means that her dowry has not been stolen from her by stupid pop. But there is the fact that there was a verbal agreement between pop and Ukyos' father."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka's brow furrowed. "The Gambling King, dear?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed and launched herself into an explanation of how Ukyo and she had met the Gambling King for the first time and what had happened back then.</p><p><b></b>Afterwards Nodoka nodded. "You are right, technically the Kuonjis do not have a claim on you as the dowry had been lost before the agreement had been made. Therefore husband did not steal the property of the Kuonjis which they had chosen as a dowry, but the property of the Gambling King, even if he had gained it through cheating. But it remains that it would be much better if we could return the yattai to strengthen our position further. Don't worry, my child, I will look into it."</p><p><b></b>The redhead looked at her mother. "But mom, we must find a way so that Ukyo can regain her honour. I don't want her getting hurt! She's a good friend, even if she thinks that she's more. And if you'd just declare the engagement as null and void she might do something rash! We gotta find a way ta help her, mom!"</p><p><b></b>Her mother nodded and smiled. Her child had indeed a heart of gold, and if anyone fitted the definition of a gentle person, then her child. "I understand, dear. And I will do my utmost to find a solution that will restore the honour of Ukyo without damaging yours. But you realise that it will be hard."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Yes, mom. But there's gotta be a way. I hope…" she trailed off.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko took Ranmas hand in his and squeezed it to show her that she had his full support. Then he had an idea. "Nabiki, you have better ways of getting information than anyone else I know. Could you help auntie to find a solution while we're away?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smiled at her sister-turned-brother. She had never managed to refuse Kasumi anything, not if he/she used that look. "Okay, bro. I'll see what I can do, but as usual, I can't promise anything."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo smiled back at his younger sister. "That's all I ask, Nabiki. Thank you."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled too. "Yeah, thanks, Nabiki. And thank you too, Kas-chan, that was really a good idea." she said and gave Kasumi-otoko a (unbeknownst to her) cute smile.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka could barely suppress her laughter. Those two were just too cute, it was too bad that she'd not to be there once those two realised their feelings for each other. That would surely be a Kodak-moment. "You two," she said to Ranma and Kasumi, "now that you have your new ID-cards you should start to refer to each other with the appropriate gender-suffix when you are in your alternate forms. The easier it will be later when you lock yourself in your alternate forms. Ne, Ránmā, Kasumi-otoko?"</p><p><b></b>Said Ranma looked chagrined at first, but then nodded. As did Kasumi-otoko. "Yes, mom." "Yes, Auntie."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka looked satisfied. "I am sure you two will manage. After all, you will have to refer to each other correctly while in public, according to your gender. This will make it easier."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. "You are right, Auntie. But you're right with your assessment of the situation too, Ranma. We'll both need enough boxers and a set of Chinese clothing for each of us. As I know now, the change can occur anywhere and anytime. But it won't be easy." he sighed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded back and softly stroked Kasumi-otokos back. "I know. It ain't easy for me too. But we'll manage. Together." she said with an encouraging smile.</p><p><b></b>The answering smile from Kasumi-otoko was thankful. "Thank you, Ranma. We will. Come, let's pack."</p><p><b></b>And that they did. Ten minutes later Ranma Saotome and Kasumi Tendo where ready to leave. They had decided that they would start out in their birth forms, and both were wearing identical Chinese outfits plus boxers. Meanwhile Ranma had also found out how Kasumi had changed back. They had utilised a modern water-heater which had been usable after the stove had been taken from the net.</p><p><b></b>As they stood in the living room with their backpacks Kasumi and Ranma really looked like a couple ready to undertake a trip, Nodoka and Nabiki noted. And maybe they would become just that, and a couple in love at that.</p><p><b></b>It is to be noted that Ranma's pack was twice as big as Kasumi's. It included two tents, sleeping bags for two persons, several complete changes of outdoor clothing with extra underwear (boxers) and two pairs of hiking shoes and two coats.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka embraced her child, and she had to fight back the tears that threatened to escape her. It was very hard to let her child go, but she knew it was for the best. That did however not mean that it hurt any less. "Take care, my child. And know that I am proud of you. I know that you can master this challenge. Show Kasumi, or should I say Yoshiro, how to be a man and be the very best woman you can. But most of all, enjoy yourself and have fun, my child. Kami-sama knows you deserve it."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded, hugging his mother back. He would give his all, so much was for sure. After all, Ranma Saotome did not lose! At the same time he had to suppress his feelings too, for he had to leave what he had begun to call home for the first time in long for a longer period of time. Which was not easy at all. "Will do, mom. And beat on the panda for me, will ya?" he asked with a smile, whereupon Nodoka nodded, smiling back at her son.</p><p><b></b>At the same time Nabiki was hugging Kasumi. "Sis, take good care of you. Though I know you're in good hands." Ranma blushed at the implicit compliment, "And don't worry about us. We'll manage. You learn how to live with your curse, and only come back when you're finished, okay?"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi nodded. Nabiki then turned to Ranma. "Saotome," she began and reached for her wallet, "consider this as your share from the profit I made with your pictures. I know that you knew of them, and I want to thank you. You helped me to keep the Dojo afloat, but I have to admit that I made more than enough money to do so. Consider this as the payment of my debt to you." she said and handed Ranma a bundle of Yen.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist marvelled at the sight of so much money, while Kasumi wore a proud smile on her face. Maybe Nabiki had really come to realise that money was not everything in life. "Nabiki, how much is this?" Ranma asked.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter smirked. "More than you ever held in your hands until now, Saotome. 300,000¹ Yen, to be exact. Take it before I think twice. But it <i>is</i> your share. And I have a hunch that you'll need it, what with the shopping you two will have to do once you've arrived where you want to go to."</p><p><b></b>Ranma took the money and pocketed it, and suddenly Nabiki felt herself being embraced in another hug, this time by the male Ranma. "Thanks again, Nabiki." he said and held the hug for some seconds.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi marvelled that Ranma was able to express himself much more freely, although she felt a slight pang of jealousy as she saw Ranma holding Nabiki. Apparently the dissolving of the engagement to Akane in addition to everything else that had happened had made Ranma much more relaxed.</p><p><b></b>Not for the first time Nabiki wondered what would have happened had she pursued the engagement with more earnest. There and then she had believed that Akane had really loved Ranma, and maybe Akane still did, but Akane was too unstable and immature for an adult relationship. First she had to be convinced that her image of boys was wrong.</p><p><b></b>But alas, her own chance at Ranma was gone. Now she could only hope that her sister would hit it off. But gauging from what the middle Tendo had seen, the chances were not bad at all. In fact, she would give it decidedly good quotes. Thus she only smiled and answered "You're welcome, kiddo. But if you ever decide to take up a job as a professional model, I'd be glad to be your agent." she said only half in jest.</p><p><b></b>Ranma released the hug and nodded with a lop-sided grin that told her how unlikely that was. Kasumi and Ranma then went towards the door, and looked back one final time. "Don't let the old men trample all over you. We'll be back as soon as possible, but you all have brought home the point that we'll take as long as we need."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smirked. "They'll be as tame as kitten in our presence." she said and ignored the flinch Ranma gave at the k-word. "If not, we'll make them. And don't worry about Kuonji, I will deal with her on Monday when school starts and keep her off your track. The least you need is another distraction, Saotome."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Thanks, I appreciate it, Nabiki." he said with a smile. Then he looked at Kasumi. "Okay, Kas-chan, lets go." he said and opened the door which would lead them into an uncertain future.</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo daughter nodded, but one could see that her eyes were glistening with tears. Obviously it was difficult for her to leave her home for the first time, and for a longer period of time to boot.</p><p><b></b>Ranma, quite unlike his usual self, sensed this and laid a comforting arm around her shoulders. "We'll come back, Kasumi. And I bet you'll enjoy your stay at Tenchi's. He's a fine pal, and his grandfather is really great! Believe me, you'll love it!"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi managed a smile and firmed her resolve. It was time that she did something for herself. And it was an added benefit that she'd be able to spend all of this time near Ranma. More than an added benefit, if she was honest to herself; it was all she had wished for in the past months, even if it was now coming true differently than she had envisioned. But thus was life, and she'd make the best of it.</p><p><b></b>Finally she nodded towards Ranma who took this as a sign to hit the road. With a last wave towards Nabiki and Nodoka they exited the house. "Itte kima-su haya.²" Ranma said, and off they were.</p><p><b></b>¹ Keep in mind, this is 'only' about 3000 dollar; quite a probable sum for a share for Ranma, in my opinion(source: h t t p / w w w . xe . com / ucc /)<b><br/>²</b> We're off now</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
