</div><p><b>Title</b>: A trip to self</p><p><b>Author name</b>: Trugeta</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by Rumiko Takahashi and VIZ as well as Kajishima Masaki and many others. No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 19: Clash of the Titans</b></p><p><b></b>A beautiful spring day was slowly coming to an end and a peaceful air hung over the area of the Masaki house. The air was quiet, nearly unnaturally so. It was as if the animals in the area somehow knew that something was about to happen. Something big.</p><p><b></b>Soon it would. For the contestants were ready. Ranma and Ryoko were now standing in the area near the lake. As Ryoko planned to use some of her more serious attacks she needed the space. As did, unbeknownst to the ex-space-pirate, Ranma.</p><p><b></b>The members of the Masaki household plus Kasumi had gathered in a safe distance but were still near enough to get a good look. Only Katsuhito knew what kind of fight this was going to be; for he was the only one who knew what the Phoenix King Saffron was capable of. If Ranma really had absorbed his powers this was going to be one hell of a fight. Then there was also the matter of the well of ki-energy in him; and if he was right those two power-sources were at present growing and intermixing, making Ranma more powerful by the day.</p><p><b></b>On their way out Katsuhito had warned Washu of this; thus Washu had put a strong shield around the house in place, to be on the completely safe side; it was one of her newer inventions and was able to protect the house to a certain degree. The diminutive scientist had activated it already and now she was looking forward to the fight. Something told her that it would be a big one.</p><p><b></b>The combatants were standing face to face and surveyed each other. Ryoko on her part was surveying Ranma with a taunting smirk that showed how full of herself she was. She did not even show a hint of a fighting stance but Ranma knew from what he had seen and observed that Ryoko had to be a very powerful fighter. The huge well of power he sensed in her was a major point in that regard. He'd sure as hell not make the mistake to take her lightly.</p><p><b></b>It was, however, odd that he only felt that huge amount of power coming from the strange woman but saw no other outside proof of her being a fighter at all. For instance, she was handling her body unlike any martial artist Ranma had seen before. But maybe she was just <i>acting</i> so casually as to lead him into a trap; maybe she wanted to lure him into a false sense of safety. Or maybe she was just no martial artist but something else. Her power-level however made clear that she'd be no push-over and that in a very distinct 'd be careful; and as always Ranma had no intention to make the first move and was in a defensive stance.</p><p><b></b>He was following his usual battle strategy; taking her best shot like he had said; and from there he would analyze her strengths and weaknesses and form a battle strategy based upon the data he'd gain from her first attack. He would soon find out if Ryoko was a martial artist or not but right now he was enjoying the thrill of an impending fight too much to give it much thought.</p><p><b></b>Right before his eyes Ryoko continued to smirk. "Soon ya gonna rest in pieces, ya freak. <i>Tiny</i> lil pieces."</p><p><b></b>"Give it your best shot, monster woman!" Ranma countered, returning the smirk in kind.</p><p><b></b>The use of her nickname usually 'reserved' to Ayeka began to tick Ryoko off. "Stop calling me that ya femboy! On second thought I'm gonna shut yer up meself seeing as yer're too weak ta stop me." she countered with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on his part smirked evilly and stopped hiding the extent of his powers. His smirk seemed to say 'Who's weak here?'.That alone seemed to make Ryoko angry as she narrowed her eyes in obvious anger. There was something about him and his true power-level that she didn't like; it was as if he was constantly waving itching powder under her nose.</p><p><b></b>Due to that she was angry alright; she had felt something in him before but what she felt now was something else entirely; she was not yet as sensible to feeling out power-levels as for example Katsuhito aka Yosho was but ever since her merging with Zero she had become loads better at it.</p><p><b></b>The fact that Ranma had been hiding the true extent of his powers alone made her very angry for it reminded her of what had happened with Kagato. Yes! Now she <i>knew</i> what she didn't like about that freak. He reminded her of Kagato! This gender-changing freak here seemed to be something along these lines for even she could feel the two wells of growing power within him. She threw all caution into the wind as she got really ticked off at that freak who had dared to remind her of that thankfully dead asshole Kagato.</p><p><b></b>Her anger served to raise her power-level and with a growl Ryoko attacked; as anticipated by Ranma she used the opening he had voluntarily left. Her hard uppercut was very powerful and sent him flying; but due to the Bakusai Tenketsu training he had not felt more than a sting. A hard sting but a sting nevertheless.</p><p><b></b>From that blow Ranma had to admit that Ryoko was indeed very powerful. In fact that excited the pigtailed martial artist further; still in flight he grinned to himself. It had been quite some time since he had had a real challenge after the Saffron incident and this fight might prove to be the challenge he had been waiting for.</p><p><b></b>-.-.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko on her part bashed down the impulse to grab her left hand as she had the feeling as if she had hit a solid steel wall. What was the guy made of? Duranium? Not even Yosho had been <i>this</i> hard. Grunting Ryoko followed the course her left hook had sent him; and the trajectory sent Ranma, how else, right towards the lake. Soon Ranma landed with a huge splash in aforementioned lake and a little while later a wet Ranma emerged from below the surface. She got to the shore, shaking water out of her hair and ears.</p><p><b></b>Tapping into her new powers she flared her fiery aura and used it to dry herself. Fire suddenly glowed in her eyes and she surveyed Ryoko. "Was that your best shot, monster woman? If so I must say that I am disappointed." she remarked neutrally, even trying to keep the sting out of the insult 'monster woman'.</p><p><b></b>True to the promise she had given herself and Kasumi she refrained from now on from making any more insulting comments in her fights than absolutely necessary unless it was clear that no reconciliation was possible with the opponent; but as if ticking off Ryoko any further was necessary. For some reason Ryoko seemed to be really ticked off at her and she on her part did not want to violate what she had also promised to herself and more important to her love. Besides she thought that reconciliation with Ryoko was still possible after they had vented in the fight.</p><p><b></b>Also, she just had to think of the stupid panda and every urge to taunt and belittle Ryoko left her. No she never wanted to be like that fat fool of a father again! She had been that way for long enough and she'd do her utmost to be as different from Genma Saotome as possible, in a good way.</p><p><b></b>What had taunting and belittling her opponents really achieved? Indeed she might have won her fights easier through it but hadn't it left bitter enemies instead of just rivals and/or opponents behind? Ryoga was the perfect example for this. In their fights or even outside of them she had often taunted or insulted the other martial artist. Yet she had called him a friend and had written off his fits of hate for her.</p><p><b></b>Now, thanks to Kasumi she knew that this was not how one treated a friend or even an opponent. That was yet another one of pops failings; one that she'd never questioned before but that had done her more harm than good as she'd come to realise. She'd sworn to herself and Kasumi that she'd not repeat her past mistakes; and aside from the odd taunt or insult she'd succeeded up till now. She'd treat her opponents fairly at least such with honour; and Ryoko seemed to be such a fighter.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Said Ryoko on her part was seething due to the comment Ranma had made; a comment that hadn't even been meant insulting but had been received thusly. <b>'How dare that damn floozy say something like that! Hah! As if <i>that</i> was my best shot! That was like a lovers embrace compared to what is to come now!'</b> Ryoko thought furiously.</p><p><b></b>Indeed she had gotten a tad bit cautious upon noticing that this Ranma was apparently a lot tougher than she had anticipated; and she had to admit that she had actually gotten a tad bit unsure when she had seen the flame trick. But now after that perceived insult she abandoned all caution and attacked head on.</p><p><b></b>Her blows were however blocked with an ease that was unnerving. For Ranma this was more like a warm-up and thus she did some probing and testing. Ryoko seemed to have more than enough strength to even rival or exceed her own that was for sure.</p><p><b></b>Now Ranma wanted to test out the other abilities of Ryoko and after she had blocked everything thrown at her once more with ease she went into the offence and leapt forward at Ryoko. Nearly faster than the other could see she sent a hailstorm of punches at Ryoko which were driving the cyan-haired woman back.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was impressed that Ryoko had been able to keep up with her and she mused that she would have to use her Amaguriken speed to score some real blows. But first she wanted to test out how tough her opponent really was and just how good her defences were. She could see the surprise in the eyes of the other at the strength of her blows and inwardly she felt proud of herself.</p><p><b></b>She had gotten a whole lot stronger lately sensing that it was very much connected with her new powers. Once she had the time for it she would sit down and analyze this new well of power she felt growing within herself. It was however tightly under her control as it had begun to intermix with her well of ki; and over her ki she had had a tight reign for a long time now. But that she had gotten as strong and tough had also a lot to do with the training she had pushed herself through after Jusendo.</p><p><b></b>Aside from the behavioural lessons she had received from her love she had also kept up her training. Indeed she had done more than just to keep it up; rather she had pushed herself to her limits and beyond. One thought had been prevalent in her mind; her opponents had become stronger and stronger and she had barely been able to beat Prince(ss) Herb and later on Saffron. Thus she had decided to become stronger herself, as strong as possible. In order to achieve this she had used the times when she had been clobbered once more to train; and it had paid off.</p><p><b></b>Indeed she had been accused by Akane that she had cheated on her with 'the other floozies' because she had been away for long amounts of time after she had gotten malleted or clobbered but the additional 'punishment' she had received she had taken in stride. After some time she had just not bothered to explain herself any more and she mused that that had been the point in time where she had stopped loving Akane.</p><p><b></b>The exercises she had partaken in with Elder Cologne had also increased her control over her powers further; however she was still cautious to tap too deeply into her new powers as she had no idea what would happen then.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Suddenly she was shaken out of her musings by Ryoko's latest  her reflexes kicked in and she blocked a vicious kick to her head which she countered with one of her own. Unsurprisingly she was blocked by Ryoko and that made her smirk. Ranma sensed that she had finally found someone that could keep up with her and that she had found a real challenge made her giddy.</p><p><b></b>She had had no real challenge ever since the Saffron incident and if she could get Ryoko past her dislike for her the other might <i>really</i> prove to be a more than decent sparring partner. Ranma was glad that her earlier assessment of Ryoko had been right; the other girl had tons of potential! <b>'Yes,'</b> she thought to herself, <b>'it seems as if I'll have to rely on my super-speed as well as my new attacks to win over her. Cool!' </b></p><p><b></b>With a growl Ryoko attacked with renewed vigour and came in even faster than before. However Ranma blocked or countered everything thrown at her. In the following minutes the combatants continued to exchange blows at a super fast pace and Ranma could hardly believe how much she had improved in the last few months. She blocked the last roundhouse-kick Ryoko had aimed for her left side and executed a backwards somersault that brought several yards between them.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled satisfied. Her power-level had grown massively and she could actually keep up with what Ryoko was throwing at her. Had she fought Ryoko before her fight with Saffron she would have been creamed by the other girl that was for sure. But now she could hold her own and actually more than that. She was enjoying this fight immensely but decided to take it up a notch. Against Ryoko she felt she could go all out.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly she actually disappeared from vision as she tapped into her Amaguriken speed. Due to Cologne's training she had learned how to use it to improve her over-all speed and the results were hot! To the others and even Ryoko it looked as if she just winked out of existence.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>To say that Ryoko was surprised at that feat would have been an understatement. She herself had gotten a lot faster among other things after her fusion with Zero but not even she had seen Ranma move. Frantically she looked back and forth but she found not trace of her opponent. Her only warning was a sudden cringing of the air as Ranma suddenly reappeared in front of Ryoko; instantly the redhead uppercutted her opponent and then she cracked her with a roundhouse kick after she had used her speed and strength to jump up into the air into the flightpath of Ryoko. The force of the kick was enough to send the cyan-haired flying but it did not hurt her.</p><p><b></b>The watchers but especially Tenchi, Ayeka and Sasami were bug-eyed and watched as Ranma landed gracefully on the ground. Katsuhito on his part nodded proudly once more. Ranma had already exceeded his expectations; even he had been hard pressed to follow her movements and that meant something.</p><p><b></b>Washu on her part was practically having kittens. She had brought her equipment with her to the fight and she was congratulating herself to this foresight. The data she was gaining from the redhead was fascinating! In truth she could hardly await to have her, him whatever in her lab for a thorough analysis. Boy, was that a fascinating new specimen or what?</p><p><b></b>Back at the fight Ryoko had brought her uncontrolled flight under control and demonstrated her own abilities. She stopped her uncontrolled flight and changed curse in a sharp turn. Ranma had known that the other girl could float but to see her in outright flight was something else. Damn, she had to learn this cool flying technique even if it killed her! Now that would really take the Anything Goes Style to a whole new level!</p><p><b></b>From watching Herb she had back then nearly learned how to fly but there and then it had taken much more ki than she'd had at that time. However that had changed now and if she could watch Ryoko long enough she might be able to copy the technique.</p><p><b></b>What happened next was however a surprise for Ranma. The flying and obviously enraged Ryoko suddenly fired ki-blasts at her! Or were it really ki-blasts? Somehow they felt… off. So as if the ki Ryoko used was not of this world! But that could not be, could it?</p><p><b></b>Shrugging off her surprise Ranma leapt back and forth, left and right and up and down to avoid the ki-blasts or whatever they were. With her Amaguriken-speed this was an easy feat. While she did so she countered with ki-blasts of her own; those were however weak versions of the 'panda-burner' and only served to distract Ryoko from her real plan.</p><p><b></b>While Ryoko who had landed to fend off the ki-attacks better was busy fending off said weak ki-attacks with a smirk thinking that was all Ranma had in regards of ki-attacks Ranma disappeared suddenly once more. Mere moments later she phased back in and shot a hard blow straight to Ryoko's face that caused the other to stagger back. Ranma followed this action with a spin kick to the stomach that caused the other girl to gasp for air.</p><p><b></b>However Ryoko recovered fast and before Ranma could counter the cyan-haired girl had punched her hard in the face; the force of the blow sent her flying backwards into the direction of the lake. Boy was Ranma glad that she had undergone the Breaking Point training! Had she not her head might have been half-ripped off from the strength Ryoko had put behind the blow. Her opponent had obviously realised too that she could stomach a lot. Good.</p><p><b></b>As she flew back she executed what she had seen Ryoko do and actually in combination with her knowledge of Herb's flight manoeuvres in combination with her new powers she began to get her flight under control; from watching Ryoko she had some pointers and thus she projected her ki and used it to steady herself. She could neither float nor fly as of yet but she felt confident that she'd be able to learn it soon. Touching down on the ground she touched her right cheek where Ryoko had hit her.</p><p><b></b>The other girl was good! And damn powerful! Heh, this was a fight how Ranma loved them; now after she had tested Ryoko sufficiently she <i>knew</i> that she could go all out against her. Someone who could hit like that could without doubt stomach some of her more serious attacks. Going all out was something she had not even done against Ryoga in the past months. But Ryoko was something else. The spiky-haired woman was more than strong and tough enough however and now she'd begin to show the true extent of her abilities.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Feeling confident that Ryoko <i>would</i> survive it she tapped into her new powers to power up; her new attacks needed a lot of ki after all. And just at the moment of her power-up Ryoko fired a barrage of ki-blasts at the powering up Ranma. Said redhead had just flared out her true aura when the energy-blasts hit home.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko was now hanging in mid-air already wanted to celebrate that she had downed the offending and irritating girl when the smoke she had caused with her attacks cleared. Ryoko's jaw nearly unhinged itself when she caught sight of Ranma. The Saotome girl did her status as a redhead credit for her aura was huge and a fiery red. The combination of her ki-powers and her new emerging powers had been more than enough to deflect the energy blasts Ryoko had fired at her.</p><p><b></b>And once more just like that time in the Tendo compound Ranmas battle-aura was melting the underground. Fact why she let it dissipate after she had defended herself. <b>'Hmm,'</b> Ranma thought,<b> 'she's got good enough ki-abilities at least. Or whatever that was. She's got loads of potential and <i>is</i> my first real challenge in long! Time to take this up another notch.' </b>she thought excitedly.</p><p><b></b>Per her observations she mused that Ryoko was just as strong as she if not even stronger; and boy made the fight fun! If she could get Ryoko past her dislike for her she might even turn out a friend like Ryoga. But for now she had to concentrate on the fight and now she'd dig deep into her bag of tricks. Once more she used her Amaguriken speed and seemed to phase out of sight. Mere moments later she reappeared right under the still floating Ryoko who was busy searching for her.</p><p><b></b>"BAKUSAI TENKETSU!" she exclaimed as she suddenly rammed her right index finger into the ground. Said ground abruptly erupted into flying debris and a lot of said debris flew up and blinded Ryoko who had just wanted to fire another barrage of energy blasts but had been startled by her disappearance.</p><p><b></b>The reactions of the watchers varied. Kasumi was watching with a calm expression that did not betray her inner agitation. In fact she was worried; this fight was turning into something else entirely than she had envisioned for both her love and Ryoko were now going all out as it seemed. But she was confident that her love would emerge at least nearly unharmed. She always did.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka on her part was simply baffled and had eyes the size of dinner plates. A sweatdrop was forming at the back of her head. "Did she... just make the ground explode?" she asked incredulous.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi could only nod with his mouth hanging open. He had never seen anything quite like it. Nor had the others except Kasumi for this matter. Katsuhito on his part smiled despite the property damage done. Ranma was really good!</p><p><b></b>Mihoshi on her part boggled too. "And that fiery thing around her melted the ground!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Washu's eyes were gleaming in face of all the data she was collecting. This was a really fascinating specimen and she could hardly wait to get her, him, whatever into her lab.</p><p><b></b>Ranma used the diversion she had created with the Breaking Point technique to leap up at the temporarily blinded Ryoko and executed her next attack. Due to what she had observed and learned from Ryoko regarding floating and flying she was able to stay longer in the air than ever before and that gave her the time and occasion to execute her next attack with perfection. "KACHUU TENSHIN AMAGURIKEN!" she yelled and began to pummel Ryoko with the super-speed attack.</p><p><b></b>Understandably Ryoko felt like she had been hit full force by a speeding freight train as she was sent face-first down to the ground where she created an impact crater. Meanwhile Ranma had landed in a series of gracefully executed somersaults a good distance away from the crater. Even with the aid of her new powers her fists hurt. Damn, Ryoko was tough! And she was already recovering! Boy was that a fight!</p><p><b></b>Standing at the side-lines little Washu was impressed and looked up from the display of her recording device. "She just delivered 850 punches in less than one second. Impressive! Hadn't I made Ryoko out of sterner stuff this would have been the end of the fight." she stated matter-of-factly.</p><p><b></b>"Ranma delivered <i>850</i> blows less than one second?" Tenchi asked excited, "That's <i>more</i> than just impressive, little Washu! That is way cool!"</p><p><b></b>The little scientist nodded. "Specifically it was 850 blows in 0.9195864 seconds. Quite fascinating, your friend."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi nodded with a grin while Ayeka smirked. "I believe Ryo-Ohki was right. in trying to warn Ryoko. It is clear that she is in trouble." she said. Then she turned to Washu. "But how is this possible, little Washu? Is Ranma human or not?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>The scientist shrugged. "Can't say without a thorough lab analysis. And boy do I look forward to that one! Bwahahahahaa! Soon I will find out what makes you tick, Ranma Saotome!"</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>While Ranma was waiting for Ryoko to get up and resume the fight a sudden chill went down her spine. As if someone was talking about her in a way that would bring nothing good for her. Odd...</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ryoko had gathered her bearings again down in the crater she had involuntarily created. "Now what the nine hells <i>was that</i>?" she asked herself.</p><p><b></b>Her head hurt like she had spent ten days drinking extensively in the bar of Ter'Luch, the worst star base in the known eighteen galaxies. Luckily her mother had made her of such stern stuff; thus she was able to shake the effects of effortlessly. It seemed that she had underestimated her opponent; it was something she would not do again as Ranma seemed to be at least as strong as she. "Grrr, time to get really serious. Kids gloves are off!" she grumbled and summoned her energy sword.</p><p><b></b>Feat that surprised Ranma for a second. Aside from Herb no baka no one had been able to form a sword with their ki until now. Or <i>was</i> it really ki? Ranma shrugged. She would have time enough to analyze this at a later point in time. <b>'Okay, now it is time to get <i>really</i> serious.'</b> she thought and unconsciously mirrored Ryoko's grumblings from some seconds ago,<b> 'The kids' gloves are off now. No more nice Ranma!'</b></p><p><b></b>Facing Ryoko who had gotten up and was standing at the ready Ranma tapped into the new well of power as well as into her vast ki-reserves.</p><p><b></b>Fact that did not go unnoticed by Washu's instruments. "I'll be!" the little scientist exclaimed excitedly. "According to my scanners Ranma's power-level is rising dramatically! Aside from her internal ki-energies she seems to access some kind of power unknown to me. Before I could not say with exactness but she's getting stronger! I can't say if her power is Juraian in origin, the data is too unclear as the two power-sources are intermixing. But she is <i>very</i> strong! And her power-level is still rising!"</p><p><b></b>While Kasumi wondered at the 'Juraian'-part Ranma had finished powering up. She was now engulfed in a fiery aura and her eyes blazed. Like Ryoko she was now looking like a demon from hell.</p><p><b></b>"Incredible!" Washu exclaimed as she read her scanner, "According to my readings she is now at least as strong as you, Katsuhito!" she exclaimed. Said Katsuhito nodded to himself and was smiling a prideful smile while he watched Ranma powering up further.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko, not to be bested powered up herself and then came at Ranma like the demon from hell she had once thought to have been. At first she used her energy sword and tried to slice the offending girl with it but noticed soon that Ranma was way too fast now. Ryoko might have been strong and tough but her Amaguriken speed gave Ranma the edge she needed to avoid each and every sword-strike. And in addition to her speed the redhead was also strong and tough enough to hold her own against Ryoko.</p><p><b></b>Getting somewhat frustrated with her lack of success Ryoko then fired yet another barrage of energy blasts at Ranma but this time the pigtailed martial artist dodged every single one instead of taking them head on, only using her superior speed.</p><p><b></b>Weaving around the blasts at a speed that was insane Ranma was suddenly in Ryoko's face and well within her defences. The punch to the ex-space-pirates face was however suddenly blocked by an unexpected hindrance. "A forcefield? You can make a forcefield with your ki?" she asked in surprise as she executed a backflip to avoid the counter-attack that followed at <i>her</i> face.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko smirked. "Your luck has run out. What you can't hit you can't defeat regardless of your strength and power. Now it's my turn, kitten."</p><p><b></b>Ranma shuddered at the 'k'-word. "I'm not out of the game yet!" she countered in defiance.</p><p><b></b>Then, under the protection of the force-field, Ryoko attacked. While Ranma was busy dodging the blows she reached out with her 'aura-senses' and perceived the force-field that hindered her to lay hands on Ryoko. It was like in that Dragonball Z episode she had watched where Majin Buu had gone berserk and had been engulfed in a forcefield that hindered Vegetto to knock him out of it.</p><p><b></b>But in contrast to the Anime character Vegetto she could not trust her new powers so much as of yet that she would be able to overpower the forcefield Ryoko had erected. She'd have to overcome it in another way as she did not want to endanger Ryoko too much. Sure the other was tough but who could guarantee her that nothing would go wrong? Nope, she wouldn't take chances.</p><p><b></b>Thus Ranma began analyzing the force-field with her senses while Ryoko was pressing her attacks; the redhead was searching for weak spots she could exploit while she dodged and weaved around the blows Ryoko dealt out. <i>Every</i> forcefield had a weak spot and like with the Breaking Point technique it was the question of finding it.</p><p><b></b>And after some moments Ranma nodded to herself. There! Just beneath Ryoko's shoulder blades was the weakest spot of the forcefield. Had Ranma ever read the novel about Siegfried the dragon slayer she would have found it ironic!</p><p><b></b>For just like it had been for the mythological hero Ryoko's weak spot was on her back too. Normally Ranma hated to attack from behind but in this case she had no other choice. Shrugging cutely she began to lure Ryoko into the necessary position.</p><p><b></b>At just the right moment she used her Amaguriken speed to get behind Ryoko; speed, which had even been enhanced through the training with Cologne and through her own growth in power. "Flaming Orb!" she yelled and fired a much stronger version of her trademark ki-attack at the weak spot she had sensed within the shield.</p><p><b></b>The 'Flaming orb' was actually a combination of her ki-powers and her new, emerging powers and much stronger than its predecessor; one could say it was a stronger version of the 'Panda flambé' she had used on her father one time. The fiery sphere sped towards Ryoko and hit her or more precisely the force-field dead centre.</p><p><b></b>Seconds later said force-field winked out of existence much to Ryoko's astonishment. Nearly no one had ever managed to disable her forcefield! What <i>was</i> this boy, girl, or whatever before her? No normal human could throw energy blasts or do any of the stuff s/he had! And that had been one hell of a strong energy blast, nothing like those weak ones she had used before! No, there was <i>no way</i> in hell that this Ranma was a normal human! But what was s/he?</p><p><b></b>Shaking herself out of her musings she decided to act. The similarities between Ranma and Kagato concerning their powers were just too much and now she was getting really angry at the redhead. How dare she disable her precious forcefield! Did she think they were growing on trees or what?</p><p><b></b>Growling she attacked once more but to her astonishment she was blocked once again. Ranma then shot a quick roundhouse-kick to Ryoko's head and the force of the kick sent the ex-space pirate straight through a couple of trees. "Sorry Katsuhito!" she exclaimed sheepishly, dejected at having destroyed the trees. After the dust had settled from her counter-attack she clasped her hands. "Now that should give her a good headache." she commented with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>"A good headache, ya say?" a voice suddenly asked from behind. "Here's the motherload for ya!"</p><p><b></b>This time Ranma had no time to defend herself from the attack that immediately followed the statement and as <i>she</i> went flying at another group of trees she inwardly scolded herself for having let her guard down. The strength of the punch had also been surprising for it had been even stronger than even Ryoga's best shot. Fact that brought a smile to her face. She just loved tough fights!</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>What Ranma had not seen was that Ryoko had used her ability to teleport from the spot she had been in to the spot behind Ranma. This had given her an edge.</p><p><b></b>As Ranma crashed through an array of trees Sasami had clasped a hand over her mouth. She knew how tough Ryoko was and the ex-space-pirate could survive such a blow with ease. But what about Ranma?<br/>"Oh my I hope she's not hurt!" the little girl exclaimed with worry.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi laid a comforting hand on the little girls shoulder. "Have faith. Ranma has survived much worse. In fact I could tell you stories you would not believe." she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>"Really?" Sasami asked, looking up into the taller girls face.</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo girl nodded with a serene smile and suddenly, a few seconds later the tree trunks that had landed upon Ranma were incinerated in a fiery display of power. In midst a crater stood Ranma and as she realigned her joints she was still engulfed in an aura of pure fire, not looking worse for the wear. She looked at Ryoko. "That <i>tickled</i>." she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>In reality, had it not been for her new powers and her Bakusai Tenketsu training she would have been severely injured. She had been tough back then but only her new powers and the toughness she had acquired through the training in the Breaking Point prevented her from losing badly to Ryoko. In fact she knew that she had a <i>small</i> edge over the other girl due to her speed-advantage but an edge was an edge; and she planned to use this edge.</p><p><b></b>Washu was once more having kittens. "Incredible! Not so much as a scratch! A normal human being would have been incapacitated or dead! What<i> is </i>she?" she asked with a gleam in her eyes.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Her daughter was currently asking herself the same thing. She had landed one of her strongest blows ever, had not held back in the slightest and had sent that irritating girl right through those trees. And then she got up and said it had <i>tickled</i>! What was it with her?</p><p><b></b>Slowly Ryoko began to worry that her Ryo-Ohki had been right and that she <i>was</i> knee deep in trouble and in high over her head. She sensed that she was probably the stronger fighter even if not by much but the damn speed-advantage the redhead had was showing. That Ranma seemed to be nearly as tough as she was did not help her, Ryoko, any. However her ingrained self-esteem and confidence in her abilities override those worries however. She had survived enough fights in dubious bars and she'd not back out of a fight against a human!</p><p><b></b>That she did not call it an honourable draw at this point had nothing to do with the fact that her rival Ayeka was watching the fight. No of course not. "You're not half bad." she finally admitted.</p><p><b></b>Ranma cocked her head and showed a smirk. "The same goes for you. But you ain't seen nothin' yet, sister." she said.</p><p><b></b>Time for some more hand to hand. She would show her opponent what the costs were in only relying on strength and endurance without having technique or style and most important, speed. Sure, Ryoko was pretty darn powerful and strong and most probably one of the toughest fighters she had fought but considering technique and style she was an amateur; so as if she'd fought in a lot of street fights or in pub-brawls where toughness, endurance and strength mattered the most.</p><p><b></b>She, Ranma, had had style and technique before she had grown in power, strength and endurance. Time to show Ryoko what a difference style and technique added to those factors could make.</p><p><b></b>Tapping into her Amaguriken speed she phased out once more and reappeared before Ryoko; the redhead immediately launched a barrage of blows at the startled Ryoko before she could raise her defences. Each blow felt like a jackhammer to the surprised ex-space-pirate and Ryoko could not block a single punch and staggered back. Only her extraordinary toughness saved her at this point.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded to herself. It was just like she had thought. Ryoko was all raw power and toughness but no match for her regarding speed. But she was good and to be honest her best opponent in a long time. However now it was time to end this for she was getting <i>really</i> hungry.</p><p><b></b>Using her boosted strength and speed Ranma covered the distance separating them and connected an upper-cut to Ryoko's chin before the cyan-haired woman could defend herself; actually Ryoko had planned to phase through the ground to surprise her opponent but the surprise attack thwarted her plans and the blow senther flying towards the lake. Ryoko just had been too slow to enact her own plan and Ranma had played out her speed-advantage to the fullest. The other girl impacted at the shore, somewhat dazed and surprised from both the attack itself and the strength behind it; she simply had not seen it coming.</p><p><b></b>Then Ranma began to ready one of her new moves. From watching Dragonball Z she had learned a lot. During the times she had always needed to cool down from Akane's many fits she'd spent the time practising the moves which she had found out were doable. She'd found out to her surprise that a lot of what had been used in the show could be built upon to create or revise her own attacks.</p><p><b></b>Thus even Kasumi was surprised when Ranma suddenly cupped her hands to her right side and not only her eyes grew to the size of dinner-plates when Ranma began to chant and a yellow glow grew in her hands. "KA… NE… MO… KU… HAA!" she shouted.</p><p><b></b>At the moment when she had uttered the last syllable a huge yellow beam exited her palms and headed straight for Ryoko. The ex-space pirate had gotten to her feet and was ready to resume the fight but when she laid eyes on the energy attack that headed her way she had the classic look of a deer caught in the headlights on her face. Her jaw impacted onto the ground from sheer surprise at seeing something that she had only ever seen before in an anime series.</p><p><b></b>The watchers had their jaws on the ground too and only Washu was unaffected. The little scientist was grinning like a maniac despite what would happen to her daughter in a few seconds. But Washu did not worry too much. She had made Ryoko of really stern stuff and was certain that she'd only receive some scraps and bruises. Besides the power-level of that attack seemed to have been carefully gauged so as only to knock her daughter out; which showed great control over her powers.</p><p><b></b>But what Ranma had done there was incredible and should have been impossible! Yes, she'd have to get her into her lab somehow so that she could find out what made her tick. That had priority even over her ploy to get samples from Tenchi!</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>As the attack headed for Ryoko everyone saw that it was too late for her to teleport out of the way and the attack hit her dead on. Ranma had gauged the energy level of her new attack very carefully so as not to kill Ryoko accidentally. The other girl had been irritating as hell and her insults had stung but still, Ranma hoped that they would be able to get along.</p><p><b></b>Ever since she had overcome her foot-in-mouth-disease and had begun to treat Ryoga better she had come to know that it was far easier to get along with people if one refrained from insulting and taunting them. Besides, even despite her slowness compared to her Ryoko would make an <i>excellent</i> sparring partner. The other girl was <i>very</i> tough and strong!</p><p><b></b>Had her own powers not been boosted so much Ryoko would have wiped the ground with her; she also sensed that the other had loads of room for improvement. Thus she watched with a semi-chagrined expression as the attack headed for the cyan-haired woman.</p><p><b></b>Washu on her part was grinning like a maniac and silently thanked herself for her genius and that she had used it to develop such superb technological wonders. Due to them she would have the whole fight on data crystals! Soon she would have a whole new specimen to analyze. And what a fascinating one! Oh the joy! As Washu erupted in her trademark insane scientist laughter # 127 everyone shuddered and Tenchi said a quick prayer to Kami-sama to spare his childhood friend.</p><p><b></b>As no one had ever seen such an attack before except for on the TV everyone still had eyes the size of dinner plates. Even Katsuhito was flabbergasted. He had never seen anything like that before and he had seen a lot in his long life. Amazing! He only hoped that Ryoko would survive it; though considering Ranma's character he was sure that she'd not harm Ryoko overly much.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile said Ryoko had been hit by the Kanemoku-ha wave and the ex-space pirate noticed soon that all her fighting against it did not help. The attack was simply too strong and she felt how it overwhelmed her. Inwardly she still raged against the attack and when it engulfed her fully she growled at her inability to beat the offending redhead as she got pushed over the ground by the energy wave. Finally she came to a stop only inches away from the lake and nearly threatened to black out.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part suddenly seemed to disappear and nearly instantly reappeared beside Ryoko. The ex-space pirate was still conscious and she was recovering fast; however she was too weak at the moment to defend herself properly and expected the killing blow to come any second now.</p><p><b></b>Dazed the daughter of Washu shook her head to clear it and when Ranma held a hand out a very surprised Ryoko took it and let Ranma help her up. No, that was not going the way she had though it would. She had been sure that Ranma would blast her to oblivion! But instead the redhead helped her to get to her feet! What was going on here?</p><p><b></b>The redhead in question on her part smiled a genuine smile at the cyan-haired woman. Fact that surprised the latter further and lowered her defences somewhat. "Ya pack one helluva wallop, monster woman." Ranma said and one could hear that this was not meant in an insulting way.</p><p><b></b>"Yer not so bad either, femboy." she countered surprised and she noticed that the sting she had added before when uttering the word femboy was gone.</p><p><b></b>Taking in Ranma as if for the first time she began to notice that the redhead was nothing like Kagato. After the fight had been over and she had been defeated by an Anime-attack (she was ready to rip out her hair cause of that!) the redhead had not knocked her out like she would have expected. Instead she had helped her! Maybe she had judged Ranma wrong; and to be honest with herself she could not fault the gender-changing individual for reacting the way s/he had.</p><p><b></b>She had really insulted Ranma unreasonably mainly because she had felt the similarities with Kagato; but now that she knew that Ranma was different she hoped that they could start anew. She just had to learn how to do the Kanemoku-ha wave!</p><p><b></b>Ranma had noticed the introspective mood of Ryoko and decided to clear some things up. "Hey monster woman," she exclaimed and once more the sting was gone, "I'm really not here to steal Tenchi away. He's my best pal and I'm just not into guys. Not into anyone besides Kasumi." she added with a lop-sided smile.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko nodded. "Yeah, I realise that now. Sorry fer biting yer head off but ya reminded me of someone I really hate. He's dead now and till today I hope and pray that the bastich burns in the deepest hell!" she exclaimed with venom before sobering up. "Sorry fer projecting that on ya."</p><p><b></b>The redhead realised that this was as far as Ryoko would go in giving her an apology. Inwardly she smiled. The two of them were obviously very much alike; that was probably also the reason why they had clashed. But now that that had been cleared they'd hopefully be able to start fresh. "No prob. I know what ya mean and how ya feel. Besides nothing much happened…" she said as she started looking around. "Oops. Gotta correct myself: not much that a good gardener won't be able to remedy…" she added sheepishly.</p><p><b></b>The cyan-haired girl looked around to and took the damage they had done in. She too shared the sheepish expression of the redhead and agreed with her assessment. They had indeed done quite a lot of damage here. "Guess yer right, freak. But I gotta say it was a good fight."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled at Ryoko. "Sure was, monster woman. But next time let us try to keep the property damage down. The compound's just too nice to be destroyed…"</p><p><b></b>Once more the cyan-haired woman was surprised at the attitude of the redhead. Ranma was not how she had expected her to be. It seemed she had really projected the image she had had of Kagato onto Ranma due to his/her enormous powers; and that had been a mistake. Now that she had realised that she had no hard feelings any more. Those had been replaced by a grudging respect for the redhead.</p><p><b></b>It had been a good fight but the next time around she would beat her! Those were the thoughts of Ryoko when they started walking over to where the others were standing.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>It seemed that the animosity between Ranma and Ryoko had dissipated and had instead changed into something of a rivalry. Maybe the two had just needed to vent some frustrations over meeting someone who was so similar, Washu mused. Both her daughter and Ranma were very headstrong, confident and partially arrogant personalities and thus it was no wonder that those two had collided at first. And what a clash that had been!</p><p><b></b>Inwardly Washu smiled. Maybe her daughter had finally found someone with whom she could compete on a healthy basis. She, too, wished for her Ryoko to win the hand of Tenchi but she also knew that it was hard for her daughter to compete with Ayeka day in and day out.</p><p><b></b>Despite her rough exterior Washu knew that her Ryoko was a softie inside and that she sometimes felt insecure in face of the perfectly mannered royal competition. Who knew, maybe those two, Ranma and her daughter, would even be good for each other now that they had apparently overcome their initial differences. Washu nodded to herself, satisfied with the outcome of the fight and the data she had acquired.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile the others watched how Ranma helped Ryoko to her feet after the ex-space-pirate had literally been shoved over the ground. Katsuhito smiled when Ranma helped Ryoko to her feet; the old Shinto priest was very pleased with the behaviour Ranma was displaying.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded to himself in a satisfied way. If anything the child of Nodoka was honourable. Not many would have helped an opponent after they had beaten them. That alone spoke volumes about Ranma's character. And the power the young gender-changing individual had displayed! It had nearly been even more than he had at his disposal. She had even created an honest to goodness energy wave only by using her ki!</p><p><b></b>Similar thoughts were running through Washu's head as the redhead analyzed the fight. Foremost, the ki-reserves the young martial artist possessed were <i>huge</i>! Not to mention that this other well of power Ranma had accessed was <i>very</i> interesting and warranted more research. Washu still did not know if it was of Juraian origin; but she'd find out. As soon as she'd get Ranma into her lab.</p><p><b></b>As far as Washu could tell from her observations Ranma seemed to be <i>much</i> more than a normal human and it would be very interesting to hear her complete life-story. Maybe she could deduce facts from that. The scientist nodded to herself. She could hardly wait to get Ranma into her lab.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>A minute later Ranma and an extremely battered and bruised looking Ryoko returned to the group. Ryo-Ohki meowed unhappily at seeing her mistress in this condition but she had warned her. But had Ryoko listened? Nooo. The little cabbit held no grudge towards Ranma however. She had caused those injuries but she had treated her mistress fairly. Ryo-Ohki spontaneously decided that she liked the redhead. Maybe she had also a carrot for her?</p><p><b></b>Ryoko on her part threw a sheepish smile at her cabbit, one that admitted that Ryo-Ohki had been right. Ranma who had meanwhile accepted that this was no cat bent down to one knee to scratch the little cabbit behind the ear with her left hand.</p><p><b></b>Soon Ryo-Ohki meowed happily and forgot even the carrot she had wished for. Ranma looked down at her with a somewhat forced smile while she still suppressed a shudder at the sound. Finally she looked at the still recovering Ryoko. "Sorry, but you didn't leave me any other choice. I did not want to have to resort to my newer powers as I don't know how much control I have over them yet. I could have unintentionally grilled you thus this was the easiest way to knock you flat."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko nodded in understanding. "It was one helluva fight but next time <i>I</i> am gonna knock <i>ya</i> flat, femboy!" she exclaimed with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>Ranma laughed a genuine laugh. "I'll take ya up on that offer, monster woman." she said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>The ex-space pirate smirked back. "Good ta hear that, freak."</p><p><b></b>The group looked at each other and smiled. It seemed that now that the two had vented some steam the worst was over; it actually seemed as if Ranma and Ryoko would be able to get along without killing each other on sight. Finally Ayeka, in a mixture of admiration, caution and not a little respect asked "Ranma, what in the name of Tsunami was that what you used on Ryoko? It looked like a giant energy-wave right out of an Anime!" she exclaimed before saying "Oops." as she realised that she had practically revealed that she, the first crown princess of Jurai, watched Animes. And gauging from the smirk on Ryoko's face she could count on being teased for it.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded and when she answered she smiled sheepishly. "It was. But I'll tell ya everything after we've returned into the house. I'm really hungry and I figure Ryoko here could need some food too."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko nodded. She did not need much food per se but it would help her to heal faster. Besides, she wanted to get back in top form again to have a rematch. Ranma was a formidable fighter, one that could help even her to further her improvement.</p><p><b></b>Ever since her fusion with Dr. Clay's Android Zero she had gotten a lot stronger, tougher and faster but she felt that there was still room for loads of improvement. Ranma could probably help her in that regard, she mused. Maybe they could even help each other.</p><p><b></b>Sasami looked at Ranma and Ryoko and smiled. "It will be my pleasure to prepare something for you." she said and both Ranma and Ryoko bowed to the little girl.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Washu ran a scanner over the body of her daughter and nodded to herself. "Mmmmhh, some food would do you good, Ryoko, for it would help your natural healing capabilities to remedy the inflicted damage faster. I've made you of stern stuff but even that has its limits."</p><p><b></b>"How badly is Ryoko injured?" Sasami asked with care.</p><p><b></b>Washu smiled back at the little princess. "It's nothing too bad. Ryoko here will only be aching for a few hours like a horde of elephants have performed a step dance tourney on her body but that will fade soon. If she were to use the tank even that would be done and over with in approximately one hour."</p><p><b></b>This answer relieved everyone and Ranma forestalled any further questions for later. First she received her winners kiss from Kasumi which was accompanied by a lot of cat-calls and whistling.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>A little while later everyone was sitting on the comfortable couches of the living room. Ryoko had taken up the additional offer of her mother and had placed herself in one of the rejuvenation tanks Washu had developed lately. According to the instruments of the tank it would take roughly one hour for her to heal.</p><p><b></b>To have an efficient way of healing injured fighters little Washu had decided to do something different than before and she had invented the regeneration tanks. This way the person could heal efficiently even from really grievous wounds without her or the others having to worry too much.</p><p><b></b>There had been a lot of close calls lately which had spurred Washu to stress her genius intellect and she was rightfully proud with what she had come up. She, too, had watched the show Dragonball Z and had patterned the rejuvenation tanks after those of the series.</p><p><b></b>Due to her knowledge of the series she had also recognised the attack Ranma had used but prior to this she would have thought it impossible that anyone could pull such a thing off. Though obviously Ranma had managed to and she, Washu, would love to find out how.</p><p><b></b>The redheaded genius had also noticed another interesting fact about Ranma, one that added to the many unsolved questions concerning the gender-changing martial artist. The cuts and bruises she had received when crashing through the trees had already completely disappeared. Intriguing.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>At the moment Ranma was sitting snuggled up to Kasumi after she had received a warm tea, a trayful of Sasami's cookies and a blanket. She had spent a lot of her energy and it had been decided that they would wait for Ryoko to emerge from the rejuvenation tank until they'd take in some real food.</p><p><b></b>Thus Ranma was munching on some more of the heavenly cookies Sasami had produced in an instant. Ranma had not bothered to change back and everyone would have agreed if asked that the two women made a cute picture how they were snuggled up.</p><p><b></b>The others had no way of knowing this but on their way to the Masaki's Ranma and Kasumi had decided that they would show each other as much affection when they were both girls as they did when in their birth forms or alternate forms.</p><p><b></b>After all, it was the person inside that counted and they'd found out that kissing and making out as girls was a nice thing too. The only thing the two did not like was making out when both were guys for somehow that did not feel… right. Thus Ranma was presently leaning into Kasumi while the older girl softly stroked the redheads' hair. It was curious that those two were apparently not embarrassed at all to show their emotions even in their cursed forms.</p><p><b></b>But then, Washu mused, why <i>should</i> they be? They had to live with their curses and that they had opposite curses made the whole thing a lot more interesting for them. In Washu's opinion anyway.</p><p><b></b>During the hour they waited for Ryoko to heal Washu decided to test a theory and used the DVD-system they had to play one of the Dragonball Z DVDs Tenchi owned. Movie 14 had an impressive demonstration of the Kamehame-ha wave and when Washu asked Ranma if that was really the attack she had used on Ryoko the redhead nodded sheepishly. "Yes, I created something similar. I know it might sound funny but when I watched this movie I thought 'What the heck? Why not?'. As Akane clobbered me often enough into LEO I had more than enough time at hand to come up with something. The result was the Kanemoku-ha wave. Now due to my increase in ki I'm strong enough to project my ki and form it into the wave you saw." she finished.</p><p><b></b>Especially Tenchi was flabbergasted. "You saw an attack on a TV show and made it useable for real life? How in Kami-samas name?"</p><p><b></b>Again Ranma smiled sheepishly. "You know, every time I got into a quarrel with my ex-fiancée I had to vent some frustration. Some time ago I had discovered a large unpopulated area five miles outside of Nerima and that is were I tested my new moves. You know, ever since I first saw Dragonball Z I just loved the show! I mean, the fights, the action, the cool powers… what more could someone like me wish for in a show? Oh, and not to forget the romance." she said with a cute smile as she gave Kasumi a kiss on the mouth which was reciprocated in kind by the brunette.</p><p><b></b>The attendees smiled at each other and Ranma enjoyed the blush that flared on Kasumi's cheeks. "When I saw the attacks they pulled in the show I thought maybe I can do that too. After all, those attacks are all based on ki and ironically the explanations that were given for how the Kamehame-ha wave works made perfect sense. I admit that I had to overcome a lot of obstacles until I got it working but once it worked… hoh boy! I'm quite positive that at least Cologne sensed what I was doing and maybe that was also a reason why she let me from the hook but at the time I did not care. I kept the new attacks a secret and vowed to use them only against especially strong opponents. Sure my Kamemoku-ha wave is probably not as strong as the original but I'm quite happy with it. Though I have to admit that one of my opponents, Prince Herb gave me loads of inspiration too. But more to that later."</p><p><b></b>"A… attacks? Plural? You mean… there's more?" Tenchi asked, while Washu smiled at what Ranma had said. Both the fact that she had adapted Anime attacks to real life and that she had praised her daughter as an 'especially strong opponent' made Ranma a person she could respect and like. But despite that she'd get the redhead into her lab come there hell or high water!</p><p><b></b>The redhead on her part nodded sheepishly. "You wouldn't believe what is possible when you got as much ki as I do now. But not every energy-attack I can do is from Dragonball Z." she said with a smile. "I had other sources of inspiration too especially from my own fights. And the Kanemoku-ha wave is something I can do one time only. After that my ki-reserves are nearly dry and I'd have to rely on hand-to-hand only. But I'm sure that with a little ki-training I'd be able to show you the one or the other move, Tenchi." she said with a smile at her old friend.</p><p><b></b>The young man's eyes gleamed and he nodded eagerly. "That would be so cool! In exchange I could teach you some of the moves I know."</p><p><b></b>That remark caused Ranma's eyes to gleam. "I'd love that. We could also include you in our training schedule. You know, I've begun to teach my love here the basics of the Anything Goes style. I know that you're a fighter, your whole posture makes that clear. So it would be my pleasure to include you. What are your preferred styles, Tenchi?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi grinned. "Kempo and Kendo. Thanks to grandfather Katsuhito here" he said with a wave of the hand at said Shinto priest, "I have become quite proficient in the ways of the blade."</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded. "Thus it might be a good idea if you learned how to fight unarmed. After all in a fight you might get disarmed so skills in hand to hand and how to disarm a weapons user might be what you could need. I might even be able to teach you how to fire energy blasts and how to increase your speed. But for some teachings I will need the permissions of Cologne. She is an Amazon matriarch and really good at martial arts. In fact she is one of the best there is. But more about her once Ryoko has joined us."</p><p><b></b>"Is her name really Cologne, Ranma?" Mihoshi asked cutely.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist grinned at her. "Actually, no. But her name translates this way into Japanese. We can't pr...pro... what is the word again, love?" she asked Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>"Pronounce, Ranma-chan." Kasumi supplied while stroking her hair. She had gotten a lot better at it, and Kasumi was very proud of her love.</p><p><b></b>"Thanks, love." she said and smiled up at her. "We can't pronounce her name correctly thus it sounds like that. There is also her great-granddaughter whose name translates as Shampoo. Or the nerving duck-boy, Mousse."</p><p><b></b>"They sound like hair care products!" Mihoshi exclaimed which caused everyone to laugh.</p><p><b></b>After she had sobered up again Ranma continued but she refrained to comment upon the Amazons. They were literally out of her hair, even if Shampoo did or did not know it yet. "That they do. But I must admit that I learned one of my most powerful attacks from Elder Cologne. The Hiryu Shoten Ha. I'll explain it in detail once Ryoko has joined us and believe me, Tenchi, you'll love it." she finished smirking.</p><p><b></b>"Cool!" Tenchi said with a glitter in his eyes. After what he had seen so far he was sure that he <i>would</i> believe it.</p><p><b></b>Finally Ranma looked sheepishly at Sasami. "Umm, Sasami?"</p><p><b></b>Said Juraian Princess smiled at the older girl. "Yes, Ranma-chan?"</p><p><b></b>"Is lunch ready yet? Nothing against your cookies or waiting for Ryoko, but I'm really starving here!" the cursed martial artist exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Everyone face-faulted, and seconds later they broke out in laughter. Kasumi shook her head. It was always the same with her Ranma. Always thinking with the stomach. Not that she would have wanted to have her any other way...</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
