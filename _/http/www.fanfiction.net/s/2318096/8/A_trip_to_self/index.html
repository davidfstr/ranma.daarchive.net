No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 8: Nabiki's plan and Kuno's confusion</b></p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi prepared the lunch without any further incidents, but with occasional glances at the other when they respectively thought the other was not watching.</p><p><b></b>Both had returned to their birth-forms when the kettle with warm water had been ready. Kasumi still marvelled that the change she underwent was painless, and she had nearly gotten used to the soft tingling sensation that ran through the whole body when the change occurred.</p><p><b></b>Soon lunch was prepared, and Ranma and Kasumi began serving the meal. All present except Shampoo, who still did not recognise that the 'nice girl' was rapidly becoming a rival noticed how Ranma and Kasumi were looking at each other without realising it and were drawing their conclusions.</p><p><b></b>It was a very good thing that Genma was not present; else there might have been another wedding in the making. Even if the likewise absent Soun Tendo had inwardly declared that he would give both Ranma and Kasumi the freedom of choice, the fact remained that Genma could be <i>very</i> persuasive.</p><p><b></b>He had proven so countless times in the past. Genma had also proven that he could be highly idiotic, and to exert any more pressure on Ranma could only be described as such. Thus it was a good thing that both men were out in some bar.</p><p><b></b>This thought was also running through Nodoka Saotomes head, and she was still wondering what she could do to help her child and Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>Sure, she too wanted to see them together if possible, but in her book it was up to them. Not to her or anyone else. They had seen to what too much pressure regarding pre-arranged marriages could lead, and she could and would not think less of her child if Ranma would never think about arranging marriages for his future children. Not after what her child had endured. No, she had to find a possibility to ensure that the men, Ranma's suitors and Nerima in general would not ruin everything. Again.</p><p><b></b>In former times she would have seen it as very manly that so many suitors were chasing her child, but ever since she had come to rethink her view of manliness Nodoka had come to see that a gentleman, or a gentle person in her childs case, someone who tried to be as much in control of his or her life as possible, could not do so as long as so many people were chasing him/her. And in order to allow her child to achieve this very much needed control something had to be done. Nodoka Saotome only didn't know what, yet.</p><p><b></b>When the meal was finally served, Kasumi remembered that Akane would probably be hungry too. Nabiki of all people had volunteered to bring her little sister, who was still in her room due to her fathers orders, some lunch to her room.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi was (understandably) still angry with her little sister, and Ranma would probably have blasted anyone who would have asked him to bring his ex-iinazuke food into next week. They could clearly envision his answer to that:</p><p><i>"What, so that the uncute tomboy can mallet me some more cause everything is my fault? Forget it!"</i></p><p><b></b>When Nabiki came downstairs afterwards she reported that her younger sister was still sulking. Apparently she had still not realised that <i>she</i> had been at fault. Silently Nabiki wondered if she should make an appointment with Dr. Jagakawa. The good doctor was the psychologist who had treated Akane after the death of their mother, when she had first shown her uncontrollable temper.</p><p><b></b>Sadly her father had cancelled the appointments after the fifth time back then, which had been far too early. Nabiki knew from her research that Dr. Jagakawa was the top shrink in Nerima, and after the behaviour she had displayed today there was no doubt that Akane needed the help of a professional.</p><p><b></b>Else it could happen that Akane might lose control of her temper and would accidentally kill someone with that mallet of hers. Not all humans were as tough as Ranma, after all.</p><p><b></b>Said cursed martial artist dug into the meal with his usual gusto. That meant that he was still eating inhumanly fast, but due to Kasumi's training regarding table-manners he did eat gentleman-like. Fact that pleased Nodoka to no end.</p><p><b></b>The fact that Kasumi had apparently succeeded in socialising her child spoke volumes in her book. If everything worked out right, she was sure to have grandchildren soon!</p><p><b></b>Soon the meal ended and Nodoka saw her chance. Just as she wanted to bring up the topic that Ranma and Kasumi would not be undisturbed in Nerima, Nabiki spoke up. "Ranma, Kasumi, I have thought about your situation." At seeing Ranma's look, Nabiki snickered. "Don't worry, Saotome, this time it won't cost you. This one is on me. You may consider it a payment of a debt."</p><p><b></b>Seeing Ranma's disbelieving look, well, the others were as baffled, Nabiki snickered once more and continued. "Saotome, you do realise that in Nerima, what with the Kuno's, Ukyo Kuonji and the old lecher, even if he is not in Nerima at present, not to forget my little sister and the situation at school, it is not likely that Kasumi and you will have enough peace and quiet to get used to your curses and bring order into your lives. If you stayed here you'd have to go to school as a girl here, and you know what that means. Not even I would be able to prevent this."</p><p><b></b>It was a statement and not a question, so Ranma nodded without saying something and let Nabiki continue. "The solution is simple, Saotome. <i>Leave Nerima</i>. Leave for as long as you two need to get used to your curses."<br/><b>'And anything else.'</b> she mentally added.</p><p><b></b>She then held up her hands to stem any comments that were sure to come. "I know, I know. It will be hard on everyone, but this is the only way I see. Here in Nerima Kasumi and Ranma will be harassed constantly. If I have learned one thing from Ranma's curse, then that: it attracts interesting situations like a moth is drawn to the flame. Now that Kasumi has a curse of her own she has no longer the luxury to stay in the background. What if she was splashed while buying the groceries? Or what would happen if Kodachi suddenly felt attracted to your male form, sis? She is as loony as they come and apparently too insane to understand the curse, so this is a possibility. And what if Kuno suddenly decides to get jealous of your male form because you're near 'his' pigtailed goddess, sis? What then?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi shuddered collectively and looked at each other. Both nodded, even if sadly. Nabiki had brought home a point. Kasumi was now fully involved in the chaos that was his life. And although he had not been responsible for Kasumi receiving her curse, he could not stop himself from feeling guilty.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi, ever being the attentive one despite her clueless act, sensed it. "Ranma, stop. <i>You</i> are <i>not </i>responsible for me getting my curse. I do not even blame you, Shampoo." she said and smiled at the Amazon who could not help but smile back at the 'nice girl', "Had my little sister kept her temper like any normal person none of this would have happened. You, Shampoo, only defended yourself. And you, Ranma, are not responsible at all. Akane is at fault, not you." she finished and gave Ranma a beautiful smile.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled back involuntarily. "Thank you, Kasumi. But your sister is right. You don't have the luxury to remain at the sidelines any more, for your curse <i>will</i> drag you into 'interesting situations', like Nabiki said it. Ya have already changed once when ya were outside. And one thing is clear: ya can't stay in the house for the rest of yer life, Kasumi. Ya can't hide, and I don't wantcha to even try. Ya deserve more."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi was so perplexed that she did not even think to scold Ranma for his slip in language skills. He <i>really</i> did care for her! "T… thanks, Ranma." she finally managed to say, only to be rewarded by a smile.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded to herself. Kasumi did indeed deserve more than just staying in this house for forever, and now that she had a guy-curse she could surely never go back to the rule she had filled out before. No, Kasumi Tendo would never be able to be the housewife again.</p><p><b></b>And this was good, because she doubted that her child would appreciate a submissive housewife. But Nodoka had the distinct feeling and the suspicion that Kasumi was so much more, and she knew how to read the clues she had seen… "My child is right, Kasumi. You, like him, have now the opportunity to see both sides of the coin, so to speak. And you can't do it if you hide in the house. Your sister Nabiki is right; a change of location is called for. Maybe a little training trip. I am sure you can teach one another how to be a man or woman, respectively."</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded. "Wisely spoken, Saotome-san. Son-in-law has indeed to find himself and he has to find a balance with his female half, else he will be forever incomplete. As this course of action you suggest would also be in the best interests of my tribe I can only second this notion."</p><p><b></b>Shampoo was baffled. "But... but... Hibachan, Airen <i>can't</i> go away! Shampoo love him!"</p><p><b></b>The Amazon Elder nodded. She knew that, and at the present time she had to hide her plans for Ranma very carefully from her great-granddaughter until she was sure she could control Xian-Pus reaction. "I know, child. But if you love him, let him go. He needs to find himself, as needs Miss Tendo. With the help of each other and away from the disturbing influences that permeate Nerima they will succeed. This time we have to put son-in-laws interests above our own, but in the end his interests will converge with our own, child. And the tribe will be the more accepting of a son-in-law who has also embraced his female side, especially after Jusendo."</p><p><b></b>Shampoo looked downcast. She wouldn't see her Airen for three to four months, maybe even more. And Hibachan said he needed this. On whose side was Hibachan? She sighed and calmed down. Who was she to doubt Hibachans wisdom? After all, Hibachan knew what was best. "Shampoo not happy, but Shampoo accept for Airens' sake."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled, although he had suppressed a snort with difficulty at what Cologne had said. Even if he did not need their acceptance, it did good to see Cologne, and to a certain degree Shampoo, act understanding and supportive. That was new. "Thanks, Shampoo."</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded while Shampoo smiled happily. "Son-in-law, I will send Mousse by tomorrow with the improved waterproof soap. If you need it earlier, stop by at the Nekohanten. I trust you know the way." she cackled, then nodded curtly into the round and exited the house, followed by Shampoo.</p><p><b></b>Now that they were alone it was time to discuss how to proceed. As they were seated in the living room various thoughts were uttered. Cologne and Nabiki had raised valid points, and even she herself accepted that it would be better for her child and Kasumi to get away from Nerima and the craziness here. After all, that was why she had suggested a training trip.</p><p><b></b>But the decision had not come easy to Nodoka. It had only been five months ago that she had really gotten her child back again after ten years. The times she had seen her child in her disguise as Ranko Tendo did not really count. And now it looked like Ranma had to leave her once more for three months, maybe even more.</p><p><b></b>It was just not fair. But for her child's sake she was willing to do it. "Ranma," Nodoka began, and once she had her child's full attention she graced him with a smile, "you know that we are right. You know that as much as I do. I have only been in Nerima and in your life again for a few months. In these few months I have seen more craziness and insanity than ever before in my whole life. Well, except for my marriage to your father, but that is beside the point. If you want to succeed in this challenge, and I am sure you want to, you have to leave Nerima. I know you're not overly fond of the idea to lock yourself in your cursed form, my child, but it is the only way you can get fully used to your female form without the disturbing interruptions of constantly changing genders. I want my daughter to be happy, and you as my part-time-daughter can not be happy as long as you don't accept your female half as a part of yourself, Ranma. You can't do that as long as your body is an uncertain thing, my child."</p><p><b></b>Then Nodoka smiled. "And it isn't as if you would lose your birthform, Ranma. Neither of you will. You will only see how it is to live as the other side of the coin, my child. I know that you'll do the Saotome name proud. And my child, from what I know of your life you have never been allowed to make one of the really important decisions that pertain your life. Now you can change this, and you can help Kasumi to get used to her curse at the same time. Show her how to be a man!" she said and hugged Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Ranma let himself be hugged and nodded slowly. He did not want to leave his mother, but what with his father and his harebrained schemes into which he usually dragged Mr. Tendo too, the old lecher and all the other crazy consorts he really <i>had</i> no other chance but to leave Nerima with Kasumi. <b>'They're right. I would never forgive myself if anything happened to Kasumi. We have to leave and hope that trouble won't follow us. And I can't really go to school as a girl…'</b> he mused to himself.</p><p><b></b>For what would happen if he went to Furinkan high as a girl during the time he'd be locked? He would have to use the girls' locker room and bathroom. What with how Akane had always made him out to be the biggest pervert on the entire planet he'd be skinned alive! If he was lucky. No, they were right. He couldn't await acceptance from anyone at school. Thus Nerima was not an option. But where to go? Where to go?</p><p><b></b>Sensing Ranma's reluctant acceptance Nodoka turned to Kasumi. "The same is true for you, Kasumi. You can't stay here for the rest of your life and hide. Go out into the world and make something of your life! Take this curse and show Fate that you don't succumb to it. You are <i>young</i>, Kasumi. You have all the chances. Use them. And while you're at it, show my part-time-daughter how to be a woman."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smirked. Now was the time to crush the last defences which still chained her older sister (or brother) to this household. "Auntie is right, Kasumi. You have given up your life for this household and for us, and only your getting cursed opened my eyes fully. Sis, you have been trapped in this house for so long that it has become something akin to a prison. But because it is also a safe place for you, you never wanted to break out of it. But now, <i>now</i> you have the right and the chance to go out into the world. Sis, everything happens for a reason, and the curse is your chance to break out of your role as a traditional housewife. Grasp the chance and break free, sis. Do it!"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi was visibly torn, and, at the moment, she felt like a freight-train had run over her. "I'll... I'll try, Nabiki." she finally uttered, only to add, "But..."</p><p><b></b>"But what?" challenged Nodoka and Nabiki in stereo, and Ranma leant also in with a stern expression.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi gulped. "Who'll cook for my family and tend to the household?" she finally asked.</p><p><b></b>Mass face-faults ensued. Trust Kasumi to worry about something like that. Nabiki on her part felt ready to smack herself. Kasumi had been the slave of this household for far too long. It was high time that that changed! "Sis, we're all old enough to care for ourselves! For Kami-samas sake, get out of this house and do something for yourself! You now have a guy curse, sis, and that means that you'll <i>never</i> be able to be the traditional housewife ever again. Use this chance to escape this household and follow your dreams. I won't let my own sister hide in this house any more. You deserve much more." she said, and one could say that Nabiki had meant every word.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi gulped once more. Her sister was right. Ever since their mother had died, and especially since she had graduated from highschool, she <i>had</i> done nothing but to be there for her sisters and father, day in, day out. She had indeed put her dreams behind the wishes of her family, and truly, over time she had accepted that it might never change. Maybe the others were right. Maybe the curse really was her chance to fulfil her dreams. To make a change.</p><p><b></b>But she could not overcome what had been for so many years in a flash. Nabiki and the others were right with what they had said, but she'd need time. "You… you're right, sis. And I'd be honoured if you'd show me how to be a man, Ranma-kun."</p><p><b></b>Said Ranma smiled. "It would be my pleasure, Kasumi-chan." he said. A few seconds later he mentally eeped when it had registered what he had said. Nodoka literally glowed, and Nabiki wore an amused smirk.</p><p><b></b>And Kasumi did not object, rather she looked pleased at what he had said. Ranma breathed a silent sigh of relief. Then he grasped the implications of Kasumi's reaction to the pet name. <b>'She looks really pleased. Not annoyed at all, like Akane would be. And the way she smiles now… kawaii!'</b> he thought.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled a secret smile before she spoke what was on her mind. It was absolutely imperative that those two went onto a long, undisturbed training trip. The benefits it might, and probably would generate outweighed not seeing Ranma for a while by far. "Kasumi, dear, don't worry about the household. While you two are gone dearest and I will move back in. <i>I</i> will handle the cooking. As for the household, I am sure something can be arranged. And I'll be more than happy to get my husband to work too. This way he can't cook off some idiotic idea. Speaking of which, I think it would be wise if you left <i>before</i> the men come back, as they would surely try to interfere. Now it's only open where you two could go."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nodded. "You got that right, Auntie. It <i>is</i> wise to leave before father and your husband return. Father would never let his beloved daughter leave, regardless of the reason. Especially if she's travelling to god knows where and through the wilderness to boot. But my sister <i>has</i> to get out of here. Due to what has happened, sis, I came to realise that you had to put your own hopes and dreams on hold. Sadly neither daddy nor anyone of us was of any help to you, which shames me. I know you did it for us and out of a feeling to satisfy honour, but ask yourself this, is this all you want out of your life, sis? Now you have the chance, never forget this. And I am sorry that it took you being cursed for me to realise what we have done to you after mothers' death. Sorry, sis."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi looked her sister directly into the eyes. She had been nearly convinced to go onto the training trip before, but what her sister had said steeled her resolve only further. "Thank you, Nabiki. You are right, I did what I had to do out of honour, but I also did it gladly and cheerfully for all of you. It is sad that father was never able to be of any help as I had hoped he would get better in time, but you are my family. I did it gladly." she said with a smile. "But you are also right. Because of the curse I will never be able to go back to how it was. Thank you for making this clear to me. I <i>will</i> go on this training trip." she said, got up, and embraced her sister in a heartfelt hug, which was returned with equal strength and feeling by Nabiki.</p><p><b></b>After the two sisters had separated Nabiki smiled. "It was the least I could do, sis. There is however the matter that the two of you will need identity cards for your cursed forms. After all, you'll stay in them for at least three months, probably longer. And your current cards say 'Saotome, Ranma, male' respective 'Tendo, Kasumi, female'. But let that be my worry. In some hours you two will have brand-new IDs for your cursed forms. I'll have to pull some strings, and you'll have to decide on names for your cursed forms. Although in your case," she pointed at Ranma, "I have a good guess. Eh, Ranko?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi were taken aback, as was Nodoka. Who would have thought that Nabiki would be so helpful? "Th... thanks, Nabiki." Ranma finally uttered, shortly followed by another hug from Kasumi for her younger sister. "But actually… no."</p><p><b></b>All heads whipped towards him. "What do you mean, no?" a very curious Nabiki asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled sheepishly. "I rather like my name, you know. Have gotten used to it. And actually, I ain't that fond of the name Ranko… too many bad memories." he explained.</p><p><b></b>That was all that was needed to have Nodoka fling herself around her child's neck. "My child, I'm so sorry for what I put you through." she said and hugged him for all it was worth.</p><p><b></b>A rather surprised but also pleased Ranma found himself patting his mother's back. "Aww, it's okay, mom." he said with a smile, being his usual forgiving self.</p><p><b></b>Once mother and son had separated Nabiki looked at Ranma curiously, as did Kasumi and Nodoka. "And what variant would you prefer, Ranma? You could either use the Chinese variant of the name Ranma, the one that is used for Chinese females, or rather we could think of spelling your name differently. Your choice."</p><p><b></b>The raven-haired youth looked very thoughtful. "Not much of a choice there, Nabiki. Considering the past I ain't that fond of Chinese anything except for their food… that's great!" he exclaimed, not noticing the facefaults of the three females. "So I'd rather go with spelling the name in another way."</p><p><b></b>Three women looked at each other, congregated at the table and were soon engrossed in discussing the different ways of spelling the name Ranma that would suit a female. Several minutes passed as ideas were brought up and discarded, but finally the three came up with their results.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka, being Ranma's mother and the one who had named him at birth spoke up. "My child, you could either use Ránmā, which means 'burning dragonfly', or you could go with Ranmā, which means wild dragonfly. The other combinations are utterly dissatisfying."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded and sat down on one of the cushions to think, weighing the options in his mind. It did not take too long for him to come to the conclusion that 'burning dragonfly' sounded a lot cooler. Looking up he grinned. "I'll go with Ránmā. If I'm going to be your daughter, mother, then I'll have a name I like. Besides, it suits my hair-colour in that form, and if I pause ta think about it, it also goes well with that new powers of mine. Burning dragonfly it is. Thanks for helping, mom, Kasumi, Nabiki."</p><p><b></b>"You're welcome." Nodoka and Kasumi said in stereo. The Saotome matriarch was all smiles. That her child had chosen the name 'Ranmā' for his alternate form pleased her and it was so easy to get used to. It was just spelled a bit differently and one could still get away with calling his female form Ranma. The choice also had the advantage that her child would not have to get used to a new name, and it came as no surprise to her that he resented the name 'Ranko'. It was understandable, considering the stress her child had lived through during the charade of hiding as 'Ranko Tendo'.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter whereas smirked. "My pleasure, Saotome. What do I have those connections for if I don't use them? Besides, Mrs. Saotome, you should withdraw Ranma from Furinkan High tomorrow. What with Kasumi's tutoring I'm quite sure that his grades are good enough to pass this grade, even though he won't finish it. After all, only one month of the current term is left, and then a break of one month follows. And is it Ranma's fault that the term was so short this time? No. Had Principal Coconut not blown up the boiler room and some other important parts with his pineapple bombs because he thought that 'de keiki were hidin' there' to avoid his bowlcuts it might have been more difficult, but due to the short term I'm sure your grades will be sufficient. I'll help with the red tape and deal with the principal, if need be." she said.</p><p><b></b>"Why are you so nice all of a sudden, Nabiki? This is not like you. Not that I don't like it, but it's... unusual for ya. <i>Really</i> unusual." Ranma said.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smirked. "Don't I have the right to change my behaviour, Saotome?" she said in jest. Then she became earnest again. "The truth is, before the wedding I thought that you did not deserve my little sister. That's why I send out all those invitations, as you might have guessed. That I said that I only wanted to get more presents out of it this way was only an excuse. In the following months, however, I have come to realise that it was my little sister who did not deserve <i>you</i>. I think that you would not have been happy in marriage with Akane, and in hindsight I do not regret my actions before the wedding. Even if for different reasons. You are something special, Saotome. Too bad that my little sister did not see it." <b>'And too bad that it is too late for me...'</b> she mentally added.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sputtered once more. Would surprises never end? He finally managed a weak "Thanks!" and embraced the middle Tendo daughter in a somewhat awkward hug, which was returned by Nabiki after the initial surprise. Nabiki smiled a genuine smile for the first time since long. "You're welcome, kiddo. I'm sorry for what I did to you, but…"</p><p><b></b>The cursed Saotome youth interrupted her by laying a hand on her shoulder, a gesture which had the effect of making her older sister quite jealous. "I know, Nabiki. Ya had ta care for yer family. I know all of it, and I forgive ya. Ya did what ya had ta do." he said with a caring smile, and because of what he had said no one thought to reprimand him that he had fallen back into slang again. Kasumi and Nodoka had both hearts in their eyes. Ranma had such a big heart!</p><p><b></b>Nabiki on her part was at a loss for words for the first time she could remember. When she had gathered her bearing she looked at the smiling Ranma. "You… you forgive me? After all I did to you? After all the profit I made off of you? After all the embarrassing photo-shoots, after charging you for hot water and all the other things? Why?" she asked, genuinely astonished.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's smile deepened. "Nabiki, I just do. I know that yer're a good person who was forced ta do these things ta keep this house afloat and its people off of the streets. 'sides, forgiveness ain't something ya can earn, but something that is given freely ta ya. And I do give it ta ya."</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo sister didn't know what to say, so she just deepened the hug and mumbled "Thanks." in a completely honest and thankful tone.</p><p><b></b>The others were quite moved at the display, and even Kasumi, who was still a bit jealous of her sister, was indeed happy for Nabiki and very proud of Ranma, even though he had slipped back into that horrible slang of his. But she'd help him overcome this bad habit, as it seemed that she'd have time enough for it.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma had released Nabiki from the hug. "Yer're welcome, Nabiki. And thanks for helpin' us now." he said with another smile.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki mirrored the smile. "My pleasure, Ranma. And there's something else I suggest, and I believe you too will agree with this plan of mine, Auntie." she said.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka looked at her. "What do you suggest and how can I help?" asked a Saotome matriarch who was very proud of her child.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter smirked. "This is something that will most definitely annoy a certain panda." she began, eliciting smirks all around. "But for it to work I must know the following: who is the current head of the Clan Saotome?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma's mother smirked. "That would be me. After dearest had disappeared without a trace I had to act as the Head of the clan. And after I learned of the many failings and crimes he had committed in the ten years of his absence I refused to give the function back to him, which was within my just rights. Due to his various actions he has no claim to be the Head of the Clan any more. Not now, not ever."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nodded, pleased by this piece of information. "Very good. Thus my plan will work." she said to herself, before she looked at Nodoka again. "I suggest that you adopt a certain Ránmā Saotome into the clan register in written letters to emphasise the differences in spelling, be it as Ranma's adopted sister or long lost twin sister. The possibilities are quite manifold in this regard. Once it is done the panda won't have any chances of interference with Ranma's or Ránmā's future at all. For it is more than sufficient that you, the Head of Clan Saotome have accepted Ranma as your daughter Ránmā."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded. She liked the plan. "Very good idea, my dear. I'll do that as soon as possible."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi's sister nodded again. "And I'll do the same for you, Kasumi. Convincing dad to adopt the twin brother of my sister Kasumi into the clan register should not be hard." she said, smirking to herself.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi looked at each other and said "Thank you, Nabiki." in stereo. Feat that caused all four of them to laugh. Then Nabiki excused herself and went to her room. She had work to do.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly Ranma's eyes lit up. "Mom, Kasumi, I know the place where Kasumi and me could stay! It is perfect!"</p><p><b></b>"Do tell, son!" Nodoka encouraged.</p><p><b></b>"You know, mom, when I was six, right before the Neko-ken training," <b>'Neko-ken? Cat-fist?'</b> Nodoka asked herself mentally. <b>'Hmm, I'll have to ask Ranma about this later.'</b> "Pop and me stayed at this cool house for a time. This was where I met a good friend of mine for the first time. His name is Tenchi, Tenchi Masaki. His place would be perfect!" Ranma exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Neither Ranma nor Kasumi noticed that Nodoka's face had blanched at the mentioning of the name 'Masaki'. As Nabiki was not present nobody could draw the appropriate conclusions. But sooner or later, Ranma <i>would</i> find out. Nodoka only wondered if she should tell Ranma and make that sooner.</p><p><b></b>Sighing to herself inaudibly she banished these thoughts from her mind. Nodoka then smiled. Everything was developing wonderfully. Now they only had to find a place where Kasumi and Ranma could stay. "See, my child, everything works out just fine. Even though it saddens me that I won't see you for quite some time I take comfort in the knowledge that it serves to help you. But be sure that you attend a school where the Masaki's live, Ranma. A good education is very important, and when the new term starts in two months you can at first attend the school as a girl. Afterwards you can still drop out of it and return in your male form after your lock comes off. Then you'll be able to demonstrate your curse to the school administration and they will have no other choice but to believe you. But promise me that you'll go to school."</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist sighed, but what his mother had said was reasonable. Ever since the tutoring sessions he had come to appreciate having knowledge, and Kasumi had shown him that learning could also be fun. "I promise, mother. And your idea with attending as a girl and dropping out and all that is good. I think I'll do that. Thanks, mom." he then said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled back. Ranma and Kasumi then proceeded to clean the table, and the Saotome matriarch noticed once more with satisfaction that those two were moving quite close into the personal space of the other. Despite what she had heard of her childs' plans, she liked the interactions that played by between the youths. And despite having hearts in her eyes the Saotome matriarch renewed her vow of non-interference regarding Kasumi and Ranma.</p><p><b></b>She would not tolerate any of the idiotic stunts her husband seemed to like to pull so much, and she had to admit to herself that she liked the way Soun was acting. He had handled the crisis quite well and had demonstrated that he was able to deal with his youngest daughter. Only too bad that it had not happened earlier. Ranma and Akane might have become a nice couple, if the youngest Tendo had ever learned to control her temper and violent tendencies.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka sighed to herself. That was in the past, and it seemed as if her child had a chance at happiness with another Tendo child, and one Nodoka Saotome would have expected the least at that. But now, due to their opposite curses this was a quite different situation.</p><p><b></b>Now those two were practically matching sets, and it would look not odd at all if they should suddenly change in public. They would still be a normal couple. She uttered another, this time satisfied sigh, when suddenly a loud yell from the kitchen emanated.</p><p><b></b>"Holy Kami-sama!" she heard someone yell, a man with a deep baritone. Nodoka recognised the voice, and it was not that of her child. What had happened now?</p><p><b></b>"Turn it off! Turn it off!" her now obviously son-turned-daughter literally squeaked.</p><p><b></b>Sighing Nodoka got up from her chair and went into the kitchen. The sight that greeted her was… unusual. Her child was her daughter again, as she had expected from the noise, and Kasumi had been turned into a male once more. The cause for this was obviously a broken cold water pipe, and Kasumi-otoko tried valiantly to turn off the water.</p><p><b></b>Finally he succeeded, but both cursed individuals were dripping wet. And it was also too late for the stove, which had obviously short-circuited, if the smoke rising from it was any indicator. Nabiki came barging in an analyzed the situation, and needless to say she did the sensible thing and turned the power off to prevent more damage.</p><p><b></b>Inwardly she sighed. <b>'And there goes another item. First the bed and the flooring, and now this. Its a good thing I beefed up our insurance policy.' </b>she thought.</p><p><b></b>With a scowl, something that was very unusual for Kasumi, he looked at the broken cold-water-pipe and at the destroyed stove. "Now I understand what you meant with being a water-magnet, Ranma. But this is ridiculous!" he exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled at him, her blue eyes sparkling with humour. "Now you see what I had to put up with."</p><p><b></b>The tone of voice and her smile served to diffuse his anger at the broken water-conduit, and not for the first time Kasumi-otoko noticed that his male hormones were very potent. It had been a long time since he had felt anger so close under the surface, and he also noticed that slowly his old self began to emerge once more. The one that had been buried under the façade of the pleasant and oblivious housewife for so long.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi knew that the others were right. Maybe it was really time to get out of the house. His sisters were all old enough to take care of themselves and father began to show signs of becoming the man he had been before mothers' death. And what Ranma's mother had said still rang in his ears: 'you have all the chances.'</p><p><b></b>This was especially true now, now that he turned into a man. After all, men were still more respected in Japanese society, and thus the Jusenkyo curse might really have its advantages. Yes, it was really time to stop being a housewife, and it was time to see something of the world other than Nerima.</p><p><b></b>Slowly a smile spread over his face. This curse, as annoying as the water-magnet part was, might really have freed him. "Yes, I do." he said, answering Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled once more. "It's only good that the old lech has left Nerima for some time. Imagine he would see me like this! All wet and female. I bet he'd burst a vessel and glomp me harder than ever!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. Even he was hard pressed at the moment, and normally he was not even into girls. But into Ranma very much, and apparently regardless of the form. Strange male hormones… "Yes, it is really good that jiji is gone at the moment, although father and uncle needed a long time to recuperate from their party in the course of his leave. We <i>do</i> have enough chaos without jiji as it is. But where did he go to again?"</p><p><b></b>The redhead smirked. "As far as I know he is presently touring Europe. Before he left he said something to the effect that it was time he got to liberate some new silky darlings, and apparently Europe has to offer some the old lech has never seen before. Poor Europe."</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo sibling frowned. "But isn't it a bit improper to leave these poor women there to their own devices?" he asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Yes, but there is little I or anyone else could do about it. I have no idea where he went, and honestly, I have more messes to solve than I can count, so I can hardly be of any help to those women in Europe. And besides, he may be an annoying old lech, but he'd never hurt these women. Aside from their dignity…" she mumbled the last part.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. "I can accept that, and you're right. You have your own messes to solve, or to word it better, <i>we</i> have our own messes to solve."</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girl smiled. "And that we will." she said with her usual confidence.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka had once more smiled at the byplay between the two, but now they should really get a change of clothes. "Now you two go upstairs and get out of these totally soaked clothes. I'll clean up this mess."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko and Ranma looked at each other and nodded. It was really uncomfortable to stay in wet clothes, and the ones they had on were now really soaked through due the water-pipe incident. That had really been one unnecessary shower.</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo could keep his balance better now, but Ranma wanted to be sure that he would not fall and grabbed his hand. And once more a spark ran through both cursed individuals, and unbeknownst to each other both had to fight the urge to do more than just holding hands. Ranma, for her part, had overcome her fear that she would get hit by Kasumi-otoko because of any physical contact fast after the episode in the kitchen, and she had to admit to herself that it felt nice holding hands, even if it was only to assure that Kasumi did not fall.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko was fighting his still out-of-control male hormones, of which he had no idea of how to handle them at present, and Ranma, for her part, was simply enjoying holding hands with someone she liked without having to fear a clobbering. But the sparks she had felt just a few seconds ago had been even more intense compared to what had happened in the kitchen. Yes, she liked Kasumi very much…</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo for his part had to exert a lot of self-control not to do more than just holding hands, especially because Ranma looked practically edible in her clothes that virtually clinged to her body. It was quite irritating for Kasumi to be attracted to another female, but the fact that this was Ranma cancelled it out. It was the person inside that counted, and that was still Ranma. But ho boy, those male hormones were really something else…</p><p><b></b>Seconds later they had arrived at the door that led to Ranmas room without incident, and the cursed martial artist smiled at the cursed Tendo and entered the room, while Kasumi-otoko went to his. Then Ranma began to browse her wardrobe, and to her horror she only found a pair of trousers of her father, which were much too baggy and large for her female form. It was just her bad luck that all other clothes that were even remotely unisex were in the hamper.</p><p><b></b>Sighing about her dilemma she called for her mother. "MOM! Could you come up please? I have a problem here!" she yelled downstairs.</p><p><b></b>It did not take long for her mother to arrive, and needless to say, Nodoka Saotome looked at bit messed up from her cleaning duty. Wiping her hands clean on a towel that she had brought with her, she looked at her son-turned-daughter. "What is it, Ranma-chan?" she asked, ignoring the wince coming from her child at her usage of the correct gender-pronoun. Nodoka pretended not to notice the reaction. Ranma in female form was her daughter, and she'd have to get used to it. Basta.</p><p><b></b>Her daughter looked sheepish. "There is the little problem that the only thing I could find for me to wear is this old trouser from pop. But the stupid thing is much too large for my girl form, and the stupid stove is broken. And I can't use my new powers to dry it either, for I don't have that much control yet. So no changing back. Help, mom!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka took the situation in. "Hmm, this pair of trousers look like they might fit Kasumi-otoko, if he would use a waistbelt. But for you, my daughter, I don't see any other choice but to wear feminine attire for the moment until your other clothes have dried. I will hang them in the boiler room for you. But first we have to get you something to dress. Get out of these wet clothes and let your mom do the rest."</p><p><b></b>Not really reassured by this Ranma nodded. She could accept that she'd have to wear panties and bras during the time she'd be locked, but starting with wearing feminine attire now? Not good. Sighing she undressed completely and placed her wet clothes onto the hallstand that had been bought a month ago.</p><p><b></b>She then flared her fiery aura very cautiously and concentrated it on her upper body. And exerting every ounce of control she had, Ranma managed to dry herself without destroying her surroundings. But she knew that the heat she'd exuded would probably still have been too much for clothing. But despite that, she was proud of what she had achieved.</p><p><b></b>Afterwards she grabbed herself a fresh pair of boxers and a fresh undershirt and changed, and then she sat down onto the futon. While her mother was obviously selecting attire for her to wear she had time to reflect onto the feelings she had for Kasumi. And that she <i>had</i> feelings for the cursed Tendo she could not deny. How they had hugged, and that in both forms, could not be described as just friendly. She had no way of how to describe it, it had just sparked something in her.</p><p><b></b>Yes, she liked Kasumi very much, that she admitted to herself. However, she was raised from her musings when her mother entered the room again. What she carried, on the other hand, was not to Ranmas liking. The cursed Saotome youth got to her feet. "No way, mom! There's no way that I'm gonna wear a freakin' skirt. Not even when I'm locked. And that is final.</p><p><b></b>Her mother applied a stern look. "Ranma Saotome, you will wear this and you will like it. You are my son as much as my daughter, and my daughter wears proper female attire. And proper also means that you'll have to wear skirts." she said with finality.</p><p><b></b>But Ranma did not give up. "But I'm a guy, mom! Guys don't wear skirts! And besides, I'm not locked yet. Imagine what would happen should some hot fluid suddenly hit me. I'd be a guy in a skirt, and I would never live it down. No, mom, I won't wear skirts!"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka's expression softened. She had not thought of this, and what her child had said made sense. It would indeed look ridiculous and embarrassing for her child should she change into a guy while wearing a skirt. But she'd have to do something about her daughters' attitude concerning proper female attire nonetheless.</p><p><b></b>Maybe input from Kasumi, who would spend the training trip with her child, would be of help. "I understand that, Ranma-chan. But the fact remains that you are both my daughter and my son. You're not only a guy anymore, but also a girl. But as there is nothing that would fit your female form at the moment, will you at least wear slacks, my daughter?"</p><p><b></b>Sighing Ranma nodded her head when her mother produced a pair of black slacks. Those were acceptable, as they looked like trousers at least. "Okay, mom. But I won't wear a blouse either, for the same reasons. Deal?"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled. "Deal, dear. And now get fully clothed while I bring those clothes back to Kasumi." she said and grabbed the female attire she had brought with her plus the pair of trousers of her pop and a t-shirt from her wardrobe.</p><p><b></b>Afterwards she left the room, and Ranma eyed the pair of slacks critically. Then she shrugged and put the slacks on. It was not too bad and not such a giant difference compared to her Chinese pants, and she had to admit that they fit her female body better than the other clothes ever had, even if she had to adjust the slacks to her size.</p><p><b></b>Then she put on socks, a new pair of slippers and finally a t-shirt. Afterwards she looked at herself in the mirror, ruffled her hair somewhat, and, finally satisfied with herself she went downstairs.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Nodoka had returned to Kasumi's room to place the skirts and other clothes into her wardrobe again, and when she looked through the open door she noticed that Kasumi-otoko had just returned to his room, apparently to get a change of clothes. But it seemed as if he was quite clueless of what to wear.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch surveyed Kasumi-otoko, who had undressed and was currently bare-chested. Silently Nodoka nodded to herself. Even as a male he was prime material, and once Kasumi had had a proper guy-training her child and Kasumi would be the perfect couple.</p><p><b></b>Banishing all the thoughts of grandchildren from her mind she knocked politely on the doorframe, and gave the currently male Kasumi the opportunity to cover himself with a t-shirt. "Come in!" he then called, and Nodoka did just that.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled and handed the trouser to Kasumi-otoko. "Here, Kasumi. Together with this waistbelt that should fit you."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded, obviously thankfully. "Thank you, auntie. I really had no idea what I should wear. This curse really limits one to unisex clothing. But I can't really complain, as I could also have ended up like Ryoga." he said and trailed off when he remembered that his sister was still banished to her room. And the walls were not that thick.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's mother nodded. "I know what you mean. This is also why I think it is a good idea for you two to lock yourselves. For these three to four months, or maybe even longer if you wish so, you will have some stability. Both of you can wear clothes fit for one gender, even if it is not the gender you were born with. But you heard Cologne. And I believe her. You will have to get used to your other forms."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded. "I know, auntie. I believe her too. It is not easy to get used to this body, as I am so much taller and bigger. You wouldn't believe how often I bumped against the door because of the difference in height and reach. But slowly I come to grips with it, and I can't thank Ranma enough. Without Ranma I would have been lost. But now, auntie, I would like to get my clothes changed." he said with a slight smile.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded and turned around. Kasumi-otoko then made to change his pants and boxers, and Nodoka used the opportunity to peek at the body of the male Kasumi using a mirror that was luckily conveniently placed. Smiling slightly to herself she nodded. Oh yes, Kasumi was indeed prime material. Her child would make a good catch should everything work out.</p><p><b></b>Moments later Kasumi-otoko had dressed once more. "You can turn around again, auntie."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch did just that, and looked Kasumi-otoko in the eyes. "Kasumi, I will need your help with my child. Due to the fact that the stove is defective there is no possibility for you two to change back at the moment, as you know." she said, and Kasumi-otoko nodded. "Because of this I borrowed some of your clothes, like I asked you. But my child refused to wear a skirt categorically, and she said she wouldn't even wear a 'freakin skirt' once she was locked. Ranma has to wear feminine attire once she is locked as a girl, and I want you to help me with that."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko sat down on his bed and made a thoughtful face. "It will be impossible to get her into a skirt until she has not found at least some of her femininity. But I think that will happen over time, auntie. You just can't force her, for the more you push, the more she will resist. And if you make her wear a skirt she will loath it and thus the whole idea of her being a girl and a guy in equal shares. Ranma has to slowly accept that she is as much a girl as a boy. Consciously I understand this, but I too still have great difficulties to accept myself as a man. But I am sure that Ranma and I will be able to help the other. Just don't force her, auntie."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka Saotome looked thoughtful and sat down on the bed beside Kasumi-otoko. "I guess you are right, Kasumi." she finally said. "Forcing my child will only turn her against the whole idea. You know what? I will leave finding her femininity to you, and Ranma can help you with finding your masculinity. I consider this training trip as a great idea, and Kasumi, once you reach your destination, and once Ranma has accepted that she is a girl too, make sure that she wears proper female attire. In order to ensure this threaten her that I will come and take over the process. And yes, I do know where the Masakis' live. You need not know how, just that I do. Oh, and please send photos of my daughter in female attire to prove that she is acting according to the rules. She does not have to wear female attire every day, but at least every third. And, if she decides to go to school there, which I am sure of, she has to wear a proper girls school uniform. Finally, I also consider jeans and slacks as female attire that is tolerable. Did you get that, Kasumi?"</p><p><b></b>The younger man boggled. "Wow, auntie! Now that is what I call a concept. That is more like a training regimen, but it could work. Yes, I did get everything, and I will help. But how should I send you photos? I have no idea if we'll have internet access where we go."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded. "I am sure that the Masakis do have internet access. I know them, and they were always up to date. So don't worry, Kasumi. Here," she said, and handed Kasumi a slip of paper, "this is my mail-address. Please send the photos whenever you have the opportunity. Some information on how you are doing would also be great." she said while suppressing her emotion as best as she could.</p><p><b></b>She was surprised when she was engulfed in a hug by Kasumi-otoko. "I know that it is hard for you to let Ranma go, auntie, especially now that he is just back in your life for a few months. But it is the right thing. Even I have accepted that we have to leave, and believe me, it is <i>very</i> hard for me. But here we would never be able to come to terms with our situation, so it <i>is</i> the best to leave. And I am sure that we will find a way to get in contact. Everything will work out, auntie. Have faith in your child."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch smiled. Both at the gesture and at the words. Kasumi was a really good person, and she had no doubt that Kasumi would do Ranma good and vice versa. "Thank you, Kasumi. And I also have faith in you."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko blushed pleasantly. "Thanks, auntie." he said, and together the woman-turned-man and the Saotome matriarch made their way downstairs.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had gone downstairs a few moments earlier. She was halfway down when she heard the doorbell. Shrugging to herself (she seemed to do that a lot lately) she went to the door and opened it.</p><p><b></b>The sight that greeted her was not to her liking. Make that not at all. For it was none other than Tatewaki Kuno, who had seemingly come to 'shower her with his affections' once more. In his hands the delusional Kendoist held a bouquet of red roses, and his face turned into a large smile when he saw Ranma-chan. "Ahh, my pigtailed goddess, how I have longed to see thy lovely visage. Take this token of my affections so we may date…"</p><p><b></b>That was as far as he got, for the thorn-in-the-side-of-a-certain-redhead was suddenly interrupted by another male voice. "Who is it, Ranma-chan?" Kasumi-otoko asked from behind her as he laid a hand on her shoulder. The pigtailed girl noticed that he was now clothed in the old trouser of his pop and one of her t-shirts, a combination which looked good on him.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled at the physical contact of his hand on her shoulder. For one, it felt good, and it also gave her the inspiration for something that might get Kuno out of her hair for some time. "Oh, it's only Kuno. And I believe he wanted to leave just now."</p><p><b></b>Kuno, on his part, was seeing red and had no thoughts of leaving at all. How dare this peasant touch his beloved pigtailed goddess? The outrage! "Who are thee, peasant, to be so familiar with my pigtailed goddess? Speak, or this sword," he waved his bokken threateningly for emphasis, "shall bring thy demise! So speaks the mighty Blue Thunder of Furinkan High!" he exclaimed, and lightning flashed in the distance.</p><p><b></b>Before Kasumi-otoko could answer Ranma had turned around to him and whispered "Let me handle the true blunder. Its gonna be fun to play with his head."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. He was sure he would like what Ranma had in mind. Thus he said nothing and leant back to watch the show, metaphorically speaking. As would Nabiki and Nodoka, who had obviously heard the noise. And Nabiki smirked. It seemed as if poor Kuno-baby would have a hurting head soon. One way or the other.</p><p><b></b>And the show began… "Oh dear Sir Kuno, surely you have heard that my name is <i>Ránmā</i> Tendo, haven't you?" Ranma asked in a sweet voice while batting her lashes, being careful to pronounce her name correctly.</p><p><b></b>One could literally see the mental gears grinding as Kuno thought this over. "Yes, my fair lady, these rumours have indeed reached the mighty Blue Thunder. But how can this simple piece of information be of importance to my love for thy lovely being?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled sadly. "Oh but it is. This, dear sir" she said and waved at Kasumi-otoko, "is my husband, Yoshiro Tendo. My brother Ranma always tried to tell you that I was already taken, but you, dear sir, never wanted to listen. You see, I could never love you as my love belongs to someone else." she said very convincingly and with more than the vain hope that he'd buy it.</p><p><b></b>Now Kuno was really entering the twilight zone, while the others had great difficulty to bite back their laughter. How Ranma played the idiotic Kuno was nothing short of marvellous. Even Nabiki admired the show, and she mused that the psychiatrist of the Kuno's (so they had one, which was to be doubted) would make a fortune soon. Hmm, if they had none, maybe she could make a deal with Dr. Jagakawa or something...</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Kuno had recovered somewhat. "W… what?" he stuttered. "Do you want to tell the Blue Thunder that thy lovely hand is already taken? No, this can not be! The heavens weep at this injustice!" he exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girl looked at the delusional kendoist with a pitying expression. "I fear it is so, dear sir. My brother Ranma tried to tell you this many times." she said and leant into 'Yoshiro', who put an arm around her waist.</p><p><b></b>It seemed as if the 'truth' was nearly too much for the poor Kuno, as he only managed to sputter incoherently for the next moments. Then his thought-processes had obviously come to a conclusion. "The vile demon Ranma Saotome is your brother? The foul beast that has enslaved you and the beauteous Akane Tendo is your brother, pigtailed goddess?"</p><p><b></b>Now Nodoka stepped forward with a stern expression on her face. "Young man, I do not know why you insult my son Ranma for protecting his sister! Neither has he enslaved my daughter Ránmā, his own sister, nor Akane Tendo! What brings you to utter these false accusations? Do you really believe that my son has his way with his own sister? Do you! With your thoughtless actions you have tarnished the honour of both my children as well as that of my son-in-law. I, as the head of Clan Saotome, demand an apology! At once!" she exclaimed, playing along with her daughter.</p><p><b></b>To make it even more convincing she actually drew her katana, and that faster than Kuno could have blinked. In one swift motion Nodoka Saotome held the katana in her left hand, and how she handled the blade spoke of great mastership in the way of the sword.</p><p><b></b>Kuno gulped once and was much too surprised to say or do anything. Then fell into silence once more and visibly gathered his bearings. "The vile demon Saotome and my pigtailed goddess are brother and sister? You, my pigtailed goddess, are <i>truly</i> the sister of Ranma Saotome?" he asked disbelieving and obviously shocked into a nearly normal mode of speech.</p><p><b></b>It was Nodoka who answered. "Yes, young man. My son Ranma did nothing more but to protect his sister and her honour from any danger, in that case from you. A course of action that obviously led him into unprovoked conflicts with you. What do you have to say for yourself?" she asked and switched the katana from her weaker left hand into her stronger right one, weaving a complicated pattern in the air to show him what he was up against should he decide to try something foolish.</p><p><b></b>For the first time Ranma had known him the Kuno youth seemed to be genuinely ashamed. "It seems… that I have been wrong in my judgement regarding your son. My apologies for that and for my slights against you and your husband, pigtailed girl. But now the Blue Thunder has to leave. He has a lot to think about." he stated and left the compound, for once under his own power.</p><p><b></b>As soon as the self pro-claimed rising star of the fencing world was out of ear-shot, everyone collapsed in helpless laughter. On the one hand they were very proud that Ranma had handled the delusional kendoist without violence for the first time, but on the other hand it was just too funny how Kuno had reacted to the information that his pigtailed goddess was already off the market. His facial expression had been just too funny!</p><p><b></b>Even Nabiki, who normally had a very tight reign over her emotions had difficulties to control herself, and the odd guffaw escaped her. When they finally returned indoors everyone commended Ranma on the superb performance, and not only Nodoka noticed that Kasumi-otoko still had his arm around her daughters' waist…</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
