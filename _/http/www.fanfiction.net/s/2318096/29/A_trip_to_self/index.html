No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 29: Closure</b></p><p><b></b>A little while later everyone aside from the Amazons had returned to the Tendo Dojo courtesy of Ryoko's teleportation. It would not have been that far to walk but teleporting was just so much faster. Soon Nodoka was busy preparing rice, Miso soup and everything else that belonged into a traditional meal and she was delighted when her daughter volunteered to help her.</p><p><b></b>That gave mother and daughter some valuable time to catch up on things. At first Ranma brought her mother up to date on what had happened and when she came to the part where the Android had attacked Nodoka put a hand to her mouth. Her daughter described everything in detail and she could see the emotions that played out on her daughter's face when she came to the part where Kasumi had thrown himself in front of her to protect her.</p><p><b></b>In former times she would have chided her child for being unmanly in showing emotions like that but now that she had accepted Ranma as her daughter she did what any caring mother would do. She pulled her in a tight embrace while the Miso soup stewed and didn't let go.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had already confessed in her mail that she loved Kasumi but to actually hear her say it and see and hear the feelings that were conveyed in this simple statement was something else entirely. Her child was deeply in love, that was for sure; and as she had said before, she was very glad for her child.</p><p><b></b>When Ranma described that Kasumi was healing at present and was expected to make a full recovery by next week already Nodoka was more than glad. She could vividly imagine the torrent of feelings her daughter had gone through when she'd thought that her love had been killed. Apparently that had also been the moment when the dam that had held her emotions back for years had broken down.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka noticed that her child was already able to express herself a lot more freely than ever before and she was happy about it. It seemed that some of the damage her husband and she herself had inflicted on their child was finally being repaired.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch had also instantly noticed the changes to her daughters' appearance upon her arrival but had understandably had no time to comment upon it up till now; now that she had Nodoka surveyed her with an appraising eye the situation was different.</p><p><b></b>Ranma still had a dream figure and her growth-spurt had only served to accentuate that fact. Oh yes, Kasumi was indeed very lucky; but Nodoka mused that her child felt the same vice versa. "It's nice to see that you're slowly growing into your assets, daughter." she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>The younger redhead blushed. "Mooom!" she exclaimed only to smile sheepishly a few moments later. "Yeah it is really nice to have grown." she admitted. "Finally I don't look like some small child any more. Though some more inches would definitely be appreciated here…"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled as she surveyed the figure of her daughter. "That will all come in due time, dear. And you're filling out quite nicely. However you should eat a bit more. You don't want to look too skinny for your boyfriend, do you?" she teased.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed once more. "Moooom!" she exclaimed indignantly. "Really!"</p><p><b></b>Her still primarily male self still had difficulties with accepting the reality that she was anyone's girlfriend and might even be doing <i>that</i> with him some time in the future but she was coming to grips with it. Slowly. Apparently staying a girl and having a girls' thoughts, hormones and so on had made her a bit more accepting of the idea of being both. She knew she still had a way to go before accepting it fully but the first steps had been made; and the biggest change was that she was slowly beginning to feel at home in this body.</p><p><b></b>She admitted to herself that she had begun to stop caring which form she was in but that was primarily due to what had happened in the last 36 hours. She still had to find out if she had really accepted this body as part of herself or if it had all been a spur of the moment thing due to the traumatic fight with the Android.</p><p><b></b>Her mother on her part snickered. "Just teasing you, dear." she said with a playful smile. "But I really like your hair open like that. That pigtail never did your female form justice."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled back. "I knew that you were teasing me, mom. But I do take some pride in that body of mine." she said only half in jest. "And do you really think so? I had no chance to check how it looks… oh damn, I'm acting all girly again, ain't I?"</p><p><b></b>Her mother smiled. "Yes, dear, it looks nice. And remember, you are a girl right now and there's nothing wrong with you acting like one."</p><p><b></b>The younger redhead grumbled a bit over that but seemed to accept it. "So mom what happened here while we were away?"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled launching herself into a description of the events that had transpired at the Tendo Dojo over the last weeks while mother and daughter continued to prepare the meal together.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Their idle chatter was shortly interrupted by Genma who had fetched a magical artefact (at least he thought it to be) from upstairs; both Ranma and Nodoka had been very irritated when Genma had started to chant and perform something that looked like a ritual dance while playing the supposedly magical flute.</p><p><b></b>Upon questioning on Nodoka's part he had stopped in whatever it was he was doing and had answered that it was a ritual to reinforce their son's masculinity by driving the growing femininity out of him. Nodoka and Ranma had stared at each other, then at Genma, and in a too calm voice Nodoka had said "Daughter, please give your idiotic father a trip into the pond. Maybe that will cool him down enough to re-establish his higher brain functions. So he has any, that is. Don't worry, I'll cover the costs for any repairs to the house."</p><p><b></b>Before Genma could utter a single word of protest a devilish smirking Ranma had rounded in on him and had punted him straight through the roof and into the koi-pond. Once that had been done Ranma had dusted herself off and had smiled at her mother. Then mother and daughter had returned to preparing the meal, a small smile on their faces. They'd manage to reeducate Genma yet.</p><p><b></b>After peace and quiet had been restored it did not take long for the meal to be completed and Nabiki, Ryoko and Ayeka helped to set the table when Nodoka announced that lunch would be ready in five minutes. The three guests had engaged themselves in a rather vivid conversation with Nabiki and Soun and all kinds of stories were exchanged; Genma, once more restored to human form had just listened from a safe distance. He was still brooding over the failed ritual dance.</p><p><b></b>Soon Nodoka and Ranma served the meal and once that was done everyone dug in with gusto. Nodoka and Ranma had also cooked a bit more so that there would be enough to eat at any rate. Ranma had joked that she was a growing girl whereupon Genma had growled.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Unsurprisingly Ranma ate the largest helpings at everything. She had used up a lot of energy in her fights and this energy had to be replenished. Watching Ranma dig in was a spectacle but not so much because of her manners; thanks to Kasumi those had improved vastly and were now more than tolerable. More than could be said about the eating habits of a certain part-time-panda, as the frown of Nodoka showed.</p><p><b></b>Having just finished another portion of rice Ranma looked at Soun Tendo. "Mr. Tendo, where's Akane? I haven't seen or felt a thing from her."</p><p><b></b>Soun nodded and gulped his rice down. "Akane is sleeping over at Yuka's place tonight. The girls had an extensive shopping trip planned to celebrate that Akane has made so much progress with getting her emotions under control."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. If she was disappointed that she'd miss a chance to talk to Akane she did not show it. "I see. Well, how about we get finished up here and head over to the Masakis? I bet they're already worried about what's taking us so long. Okay, its nothing that a phone-call could not rectify but I wanna get back ta see how Kasumi is."</p><p><b></b>That statement however brought up some questions Nabiki had. "About that, mind telling me what has happened to my sister? Or brother?" she added as an afterthought.</p><p><b></b>The redhead shook her head. "No, I don't mind, Nabiki. But not here. How about the Dojo?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki was somewhat nonplussed but nodded. Together the girls went to the Dojo and a certain Genma Saotome made moves to go after them. A certain sound however stopped him dead in his tracks. He knew the sound of Nodoka's katana being drawn all too well. Obediently he sat down again and helped himself to some rice.</p><p><b></b>While the others continued eating and chatting Ranma and Nabiki had retreated to the dojo. Being the observant young woman that she is Nabiki had of course noticed the growth spurt Ranma had undergone; the middle Tendo girl commended her on that and actually used words quite similar to those Nodoka had used.</p><p><b></b>After her blush had receded Ranma filled Nabiki in on what had happened over at the Masakis. Like with her mother she didn't leave a thing out in her narration and when she was finished she was surprised when Nabiki hugged her. "You really love her, don't you?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded with barely suppressed emotions. "And him. When I'm with him I feel something I've never really felt with anyone else before. Contentment. When I'm with him I haven't got the urge to throw myself into dangerous situations, and I find myself looking forward to the future. I have never loved anyone so much before in my life, Nabs."</p><p><b></b>At hearing this Nabiki smiled. The other girl, and that was what Ranma was at the moment, had got it bad; and she was really happy for her sister-turned-brother and Ranma. Said redhead continued in her happy monologue. "Kasumi has shown me what love is and I'm so happy that I still have the chance to tell him how much I love him. I really had thought that he had died!" she said and sobered up with effort. "But my old man is not to know! Kami-sama knows what he'd do with that knowledge!"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki sneered and nodded. "Probably something incredibly stupid. Don't worry, your secret is safe with me, Red." she said with a smile and released the hug.</p><p><b></b>The redhead smiled back. "Thanks, Nabs. I really wanna have my peace and quiet from his idiotic schemes. Why can't he be more like Katsuhito? But no, stupid pops only cares about himself. Feh."</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter nodded. "I know. But your mother is currently reeducating him and I'm providing some advice when needed. Who knows, maybe your father will be a changed man when you return here."</p><p><b></b>Ranma snorted. "I doubt that. But it's a good thing that ya keep him on his toes; this way he can't do something stupid."</p><p><b></b>The two shared a knowing smile. "And how is it to be a girl full-time now, Red?" Nabiki asked.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl surveyed Nabiki. There was no hint of anything else but honest curiosity in her posture and Ranma decided to answer truthfully. "To be honest I have not paid that much attention to it lately. The whole thing with Kasumi has shaken me up pretty bad so that I just didn't care. But I guess what without getting splashed constantly it ain't so bad. However having to sit down to take a leak sucked in the beginning but I got used ta it. All in all it ain't so bad."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki hid her grin. She had caught the real message all right. What Ranma had said translated into 'Its okay, but you'd never hear me admitting it'. Yes, that was Ranma for you; but she could see that Ranma was apparently enjoying being a girl, for the first time.</p><p><b></b>Who would have thought upon their arrival that the rough macho Ranma Saotome would actually learn how to be a girl, helped along by her sister-turned-brother? Sometimes life sure was funny. "I see." she said amused before becoming earnest again. "Ranma from what you told me your mother and my father will check on my new brother when they return with you to the Masakis. I'd like to see him too but tomorrow would be better for me. I have some business to conduct today."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded thoughtful. "Should have thought of that myself, Nabs. Of course ya wanna see Kasumi. Or rather Yoshiro." she said with a giggle.</p><p><b></b>That caused the middle Tendo daughter to perk up. She smelled a juicy story here. "Yoshiro, eh? How is my older brother? Is he handsome? Is he a good kisser? Details, Red."</p><p><b></b>The younger girl blushed. "A definite yes to both, Nabs. He's the only guy I'd ever allow to kiss or touch me. Kasumi showed me what love is, in both forms. Before I was blind thanks to pops but Kasumi made me see. I love her and I love him but you must promise me that you won't tell pops."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki grinned. "10,000 Yen." she said with her Ice-queen mask in place.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked shocked. "Nabiki!"</p><p><b></b>Said middle Tendo daughter let her mask fall and her eyes twinkled. "You're just too easy, Saotome." she exclaimed between giggles.</p><p><b></b>At first Ranma looked indignant but then she joined Nabiki in her laughter. Sometimes she really <i>was</i> too easy. With a smile at Ranma the middle Tendo daughter got up from the floor and both girls returned to the main-room.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>After the fight Shampoo had asked for permission to visit the Tendo Dojo, and Cologne had granted the request of her great-granddaughter. She might have been old, but her age came as an advantage; she had acquired experience with age, and she had especially gained experience at getting insight into people. The Elder had recognised that Shampoo had not given up on Ranma completely yet.</p><p><b></b>She saw the need within her great-granddaughter to achieve some closure, even if this closure would, unbeknownst to her, not have a happy ending in the happily ever after sense. Or maybe Xian-Pu <i>did</i> suspect something. The girl had matured lately and was on her way to become the woman she would be. After the failed wedding she had even made the effort to improve her admittedly horrid Japanese in an effort to improve her chances at Ranma. This alone had proven that her great-granddaughter was able to swallow her pride and make a decision based on the situation and facts, like a true warrior should.</p><p><b></b>From her experience at reading people, and especially her great-granddaughter, she was certain that Xian-Pu would not get carried away, mostly because of her increased maturity; and honestly, depending on Ranma's answer she had no other choice but to accept the decision Ranma would make. Her Xian-Pu had already lost her airen due to her and the councils decision, but at least she would be allowed to take part in his/her life by being a blood sister. Once Ranma would tell her the truth Kuh Lon had little to no doubt that Xian-Pu would act like the leader she had been brought up to be and accept the necessities.</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon was more knowledgeable than Xian-Pu in regards of the developments in Ranma's life as of late and she had little doubt that the feelings between Ranma and Tendo Kasumi had blossomed into full-blown love in the meantime. She had watched the chemistry between too many couples in her more than 300 years of existence and she had a nose for it. Ranma and Kasumi were steering into a relationship of the most serious kind, and they had the advantage that they had opposite curses. Definitely something to make life very interesting.</p><p><b></b>Her great-granddaughter had lost, but her honour had been retained, which meant that she wouldn't be in any danger from the tribe. Granted, she would have loved nothing more than to see her Xian-Pu happy with Ranma, but it just had not meant to be. At least the whole enterprise had not been a complete fiasco, for she had gained a martial arts heir and a very potent ally to the tribe.</p><p><b></b>The Elder watched with a sigh as her great-granddaughter bounded over the rooftops, with the feint hope in her heart that Ranma would declare his, or rather her love for her. She would undoubtedly suffer a disappointment, but Xian-Pu was young and strong. She'd survive, and be stronger for it. And at long last she would achieve closure.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>The subject of Elder Colognes' thoughts was currently bounding over the Nerimanian rooftops, enjoying the way how the wind rushed past her as she approached her destination. As much as she missed her village, she loved moments like these where she just did not have to think. She could just enjoy being free and pretend to be a normal, even if super-powered human teenager. All her worries left her in times like these, but her senses were heightened to the max.</p><p><b></b>Little did she know that she felt exactly like Ranma in that respect; while her body was acting on auto-pilot Xian-Pu tried to get out of her nearly meditative state. She needed to organise her thoughts. A warrior always needed a sound battle strategy, and the best course of action, she mused, was to drop her ditzy act and act polite for a change. <b>'So no new doors in the wall then. What a pity. It was always so much fun to see the faces of the Tendos when I did that… especially Akanes.'</b> she mused to herself.</p><p><b></b>Landing in front of the gate that led to the Tendo Dojo Xian-Pu surveyed her own appearance and straightened her clothes. Instead of her usual, revealing outfit she was now wearing a more appropriate and elegant robe that managed to accentuate her figure in just the right ways. Satisfied with herself she made her presence known.</p><p><b></b>Moments later Soun Tendo came to the main gate, and she could tell that he was surprised to see her here. "Hello Shampoo. How can I help you?"</p><p><b></b>"This one would like to talk to Ranma." she said, trying to speak proper and polite Japanese.</p><p><b></b>If Soun Tendo was surprised by this he did not show it. "But of course. Follow me to the house."</p><p><b></b>Xian-Pu nodded and did just that.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Once Soun Tendo and his guest were walking up the path that led to the house he asked himself what the young Amazon would do. To his knowledge she had kept to herself the entire time ever since the Kisses had been dissolved, deliveries aside. His reawakened warrior instincts told him that she wanted to confront Ranma were she stood, and he could not fault her.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was an amazing person, and it had taken his daughter getting cursed and everything that had happened afterwards to show this fact to him. It was no wonder that Shampoo would try everything that remained in the boundaries of tribal law. At least Soun hoped that she would stay within these boundaries. The Tendo patriarch opened the door absently, let Shampoo in and closed it.</p><p><b></b>True to her upbringing Shampoo acted independently and walked straight to the living room. During the last few minutes she had prepared herself as she would for a battle, and she prayed to her ancestors that victory would be hers. She entered the living room boldly and with a composure that would make her ancestors proud.</p><p><b></b>She however nearly stumbled when she sensed the large auras in the living room; the blue-haired Amazon was glad that she had honed her skills in this regard or she might have been inclined to discount the three unknown persons. But their powerlevels and the way they surveyed her spoke volumes. She would do good not to anger them.</p><p><b></b>Not showing her surprise she made her eyes sparkle and smiled. "Nihao, everyone." she exclaimed and produced enough ramen from somewhere, somehow. "This one brought too too good ramen! Is enough for everyone! Dig in!"</p><p><b></b>"Err, thanks, Shampoo." said Ranma who had returned with Nabiki from the dojo a few moments prior to Shampoos´ arrival, acting as a spokesperson for the others who nevertheless thanked her politely too.</p><p><b></b>"What can we do for you, Shampoo?" asked Nabiki, coming straight to the point.</p><p><b></b>"This one wants to talk to aire... Ranma. I wanted to see if you are well." answered the Amazon.</p><p><b></b>Ranma, who had expected something like that ever since her return to Nerima, knew the real reason; she had had a long time to think things through since their leave-taking, and that Shampoo would want to hear how things were out of her mouth was crystal-clear. Even without her being Shampoo's airen any longer, the blue-haired Amazon had never heard <i>her</i> say that she did not want to marry her. She deserved at least this much. Ranma was however somewhat surprised at Shampoo's improved Japanese, but this being Nerima she shrugged it off. Weirdness was normal around here after all.</p><p><b></b>Swallowing some rice the redhead sighed inwardly. "Sure, Shampoo. Right after we have eaten the ramen, okay?"</p><p><b></b>"Some things never change." said a chuckling Nabiki, eliciting a few laughs from the others. The ex-ice-queen turned to Shampoo. °<i>I assume this has not been tampered with in any way, warrior Xian-Pu?</i>° she asked in flawless mandarin.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo was visibly shocked. °<i>You speak my language?</i>°</p><p><b></b>While the others watched, the Nerimans as surprised as Shampoo, a smug looking Nabiki answered. °<i>Yes, warrior Xian-Pu. Ever since your arrival here in Nerima communicating with you has been a real hassle. Between your limited abilities at speaking and understanding Japanese and our lack of knowledge of Chinese it created awkward situations and a lot of misunderstandings, did it not?</i>°</p><p><b></b>The blue-haired Amazon agreed immediately. °<i>It was sooo frustrating not to be able to talk to husba… Ranma like I wanted to. He must have thought me the stupid bimbo I was accused of being. But learning how to speak and understand Japanese was and is still hard. This one can't imagine that learning Mandarin was easy for you, mercenary one. Why did you learn it?</i>°</p><p><b></b>While the heads of the others swished back and forth without an inkling of what they were talking about Ayeka had done the sensible thing; she had activated her universal translator and was thus able to listen in to the conversation. Depending on the contents she would relay what she had learned later.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo girl smiled. °<i>When Ranma tricked you everyone else was convinced that we had seen the last of you. I however had a hunch that we would see you again, and I wanted to be prepared. Oh, I can anticipate your question. Why did I know better? Simple. I had witnessed Ranma's incredible 'luck'. Don't tell her I said this, but she seems to be the epitome of Murphy's law. 'Everything that can go wrong will go wrong.' Her problems aren't solved this easily, and as I knew this I prepared myself. And I was right to.</i>°</p><p><b></b>°<i>I understand. But why do you keep referring to hus… Ranma as 'her'? Ranma is a man, regardless of the form!</i>° exclaimed Shampoo.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smiled. °<i>Look at 'her'. Doesn't 'she' seem more female to you? Ranma has begun to accept the curse, if she knows it or not. She knows now that she will always be half and half, that there is no cure, and she is finally beginning to enjoy being the other half. You can see it therein that she did not bother to redo her hair into a pigtail, for instance. She just let it flow freely instead; before the trip Ranma would never have done that. Too bad that she had to leave Nerima to find herself. But sadly that's everyones' fault, mine included.</i>°</p><p><b></b>Shampoo had followed Nabikis' request and had watched Ranma inconspicuously. To her surprise she noticed that everything that the middle Tendo daughter had said was true. °<i>Great Aphrodite on a bike! It's true…</i>° she grind out, clearly thinking about the implications.</p><p><b></b>After some moments and the train of thought that she'd have to find out in their talk if Ranma had indeed changed from the paragon of manliness he had always been into something else the Amazon shook herself out of her musings. °<i>And why did you keep your ability to speak mandarin a secret?</i>° she asked, changing the subject back to the original thread.</p><p><b></b>°<i>You think I should have tried to use my skills to try to communicate with you after your return?</i>° the middle Tendo daughter asked with a smile and Shampoo nodded. °<i>I <b>would</b> have done that had you come back alone. But you came back with company. Elder Kuh Lon, your great-grandmother, and an unknown variable at this point in time. I watched and observed, and seeing as the two of you spoke Chinese freely I learned.</i>°</p><p><b></b>Against her will, Shampoo had to admit that she was impressed. °<i>You turned your ability to speak and understand Mandarin to your advantage; and advantages are for using, else they are no advantages. Thought like a warrior, mercenary one. I commend you.</i>°</p><p><b></b>Nabiki bowed. °<i>This one thanks you. Now you should go and talk to Ranma before the others start a riot, seeing as they can't understand a word we speak.</i>° she said with amusement.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo kept her own flaring amusement in check. Apparently there was much more to the mercenary one than she had thought. With her cunning mind she would make an excellent Amazon; too bad that she wasn't much of a fighter. °<i>This one will do that. To answer your original question: no, the ramen is just that, ramen. I swear on my honour as a warrior.</i>°</p><p><b></b>"Okay." said a satisfied Nabiki, switching back to Japanese.</p><p><b></b>"What the heck was all this about?" asked Genma, for once voicing the nagging question of many.</p><p><b></b>"Oh, I just let Shampoo in on the secret that I can speak and understand Chinese. Now dig in and try the ramen. Shampoo has sworn that it is okay and I believe her." Nabiki said and tried her own package.</p><p><b></b>Shrugging the others followed her example, and even the three guests from Okayama enjoyed the 'dessert'.</p><p><b></b>A little while later when Ranma had been filled the redhead excused herself to the kitchen and gave Shampoo a sign to follow her. Her mother and Nabiki had seen and understood, being the observant persons they were. They were not worried. Ranma could handle herself.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Once in the kitchen Ranma seated herself on the counter while Shampoo remained standing. The redhead appeared to be completely at ease, but she had her guard up just in case to be prepared for anything and could react in an instant. Not that she thought that Shampoo would try something, but she had experienced too much weirdness in Nerima to ever truly let her guard down around here ever again. "What did you want to talk about, Shampoo?" she asked, starting the conversation.</p><p><b></b>"Air… Ranma, this one wants to apologise for the things she did while reinforcing her claim. This one only did what she had to do not to bring dishonour over her clan and herself. Hope you understand and can forgive."</p><p><b></b>The redhead looked thoughtful for a moment as if weighing options, but then she inclined her head. "Its not easy for me to forgive you all the schemes and plans you concocted while you tried to win me, and Kami-sama knows that I was often very angry at you. You often managed to drive a wedge between Akane and me, and it made me mad. But you know me, I can never stay mad at people for long. So if you promise that you'll never try to sabotage my life again I will forgive you. I want us to be friends, Shampoo, but that's only possible if I can trust you. Can I?"</p><p><b></b>Shampoo was put off for a moment; this Ranma was indeed different from the Ranma she had last seen a few weeks ago. It seemed indeed as if Ranma was thinking like a warrior, like a female. This Ranma did not give trust as easily any more, and it proved what Nabiki had said. It seemed indeed as if the female side in Ranma was awakening. Personally she had thought and hoped that her former airen would continue to fight the curse for forever; she had never liked Ranma-chan much, as Ranma had worn this body when she had dishonoured her through showing her up. But she had to know if she still had a shot at Ranma-kun.</p><p><b></b>Turning her charm up in hopes of unsettling Ranma she batted her lashes. "Friends? Is that all I am to you? A friend?" she asked with a cute pout.</p><p><b></b>Instead of sputtering like she would have done a few weeks ago Ranma kept her cool. A small smile graced her face. "Yes, Shampoo. I have always tried to show you that I don't feel anything for you but friendship. I like you, but as a friend, not a lover."</p><p><b></b>"But… but what about the time when this one was subjected to the reversal jewel? You claimed that you loved me! You wanted to marry me!" exclaimed Shampoo.</p><p><b></b>The redhead on the counter gave a sigh. "Shampoo, I had no idea that you were under a spell. I just could not understand why you wouldn't like me any more. I thought you were my friend, and my friends are very important to me. You know why? Sadly I don't have that many." she said with a sad smile. "I thought I had done something wrong and I did a lot of foolish things to try to get you to like me again. But I did not do it because I wanted you as a lover. All I ever wanted from you was friendship."</p><p><b></b>Shampoo looked decidedly dejected, even if she had half-expected to hear these words. "But… but I still love you… Ranma."</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed once more. "Shampoo, I respect you as a warrior and I have grown to like you, as a friend. You know why a love between the two of us had never a chance?"</p><p><b></b>The blue haired Amazon shook her head. "No. Why?"</p><p><b></b>"It's because of the Kiss of Death. When you hunted me and tried to kill me for defeating you, you hunted <i>me</i>, Ranma Saotome. This body was as much me as my male half, even if I only understood that recently. I can never forget that you were on a mission to kill me, Shampoo. And then over something as stupid as a challenge prize." the redhead stated.</p><p><b></b>"Was not stupid! It was an important trophy and the great prize for the winner of the tournament!" Shampoo exclaimed, pouting.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled a chagrined smile. "Be it as it is, Shampoo, but I read up on your rules while I surfed the Net. I never would have thought it, but you can actually order 'The full book of Ancient Amazon Law' at amazon . com. I thought the coincidence funny and ordered the e-book. Shampoo, you were never entitled to administer the Kiss of Death. The challenge was declared over the food, it was not a challenge fight of the formal kind, or a challenge for an Amazon male. The Kiss of Death was unwarranted, but I'm sure you know that."</p><p><b></b>The redhead held her hands up to stem the protest. "Shampoo, you know that as well as I do. Your rules for the Kiss of Death are quite strict, and how do you think I felt when I found out that you had needlessly seeked my life? I felt betrayed; betrayed and angry. Then you managed to get engaged to my male half by accident, also highly questionable even by your rules for there was no formally declared challenge, and I should instantly bow to your claim and love you back? After you tried to kill me for months? How does that sound to your own ears, Shampoo?" she asked softly.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo opened her mouth and closed it again when she realised that she could not counter what Ranma had said; for everything she had said was true. That had probably also been one of the reason why her great-grandmother had annulled the Kisses. She would have been disgraced had her usage of the Kisses ever been investigated by political enemies of her great-grandmother. With the annulment her hibachan had not only restored her honour, she had also cleaned up a blemish on their family name.</p><p><b></b>Finally she sighed. "Is too too true." she said, falling back into her old speech-patterns for a moment. Shaking her head she continued. She just could not give up on Ranma like that. "Isn't there a chance for us, Ranma?" she asked, managing to look like a kitten that meowed 'please love me!'.</p><p><b></b>Ranma really hated to crush Shampoo's hopes, but she finally had to make clear that she had chosen. "No, Shampoo. I only want to be your friend. Kasumi is my chosen one, and I want to spend the rest of my days with my beloved. I am happy, Shampoo, for the first time in my life I am truly happy."</p><p><b></b>The young Amazon warrior had looked down when she had heard the words that told her that there was no hope, but her head shot up when she heard the rest. "Aiyah! You have chosen nice girl? How could <i>that</i> happen?"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl who had felt irritable and queasy all day reacted irritated. "Excuuuse me! How now?" she asked with her hands on her hips and with an undertone that indicated danger, flames dancing in her eyes.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo was taken aback once more. It was so unlike Ranma to react this way. That was so out of character ! <b>'Aiyah! Why is Ranma so mad? No… it couldn't be that! But what if… no! Ranma just has a bad day. Oops, he, no she, is still waiting for an answer!'</b> she thought. "It's just that I'm surprised that you have chosen a non-warrior. Do you really love nice girl Kasumi?"</p><p><b></b>"And brave man Kasumi, or rather Yoshiro too." Ranma answered with conviction. Seeing her puzzled expression Ranma sighed again and started explaining to Shampoo what had happened as of late.</p><p><b></b>When she had ended Shampoo was looking appropriately impressed. "I would have never guessed." she finally said and sighed. It really seemed to be a day of sighs and Shampoo came to the final conclusion that she'd have no other choice but to accept that the finest catch was not available any more.</p><p><b></b>"Fate is funny sometimes, Shampoo. When I came to Nerima I would never have thought it either. But Kasumi was always nice to me, and much more grew from it. There is just too much between us, Shampoo, beside the fact that I don't love you like I love Kasumi. You still think of me as a prize to be won over and not as an equal. In your village, even if I went with you (what I won't) I'd only be a second class citizen; and that is something I could never accept." the redhead said with conviction.</p><p><b></b>Despite her rapidly dwindling hopes Shampoo looked pleadingly at her and brokenly asked "Ranma, can't you give me a chance?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed. "Shampoo, there has just happened too much in the past between us. The Kiss of Death where you hunted me like a wild animal, your several tries to get me by magic, all the times you drove a wedge between Akane and me and so much more. No, Shampoo, there is no chance for love between us."</p><p><b></b>The blue haired Amazons's whole posture slumped in acceptance. Just one look into those blue eyes told her that Ranma meant what she said, and she had to accept it or she'd become as much an obsessive maniac as Mu-Tzu had been. She had tried everything within the laws and the thought to employ illegal means briefly touched her mind; but one thing Ranma had said crushed that thought as fast as it had popped up. "I am happy." Ranma had said.</p><p><b></b>And when one looked at the redhead for a longer moment one could see visual proof for this. Ranma indeed looked like a, yes, a woman in love. And this love was true, genuine love and apparently this type of love that would last a lifetime. Anything she could try to win Ranma's love, all the magical means, would only create an artificial love and not true love that came from the heart.</p><p><b></b>Her own heart was breaking but Shampoo realised that she had no other choice but to let Ranma go. She had tried everything to win Ranma's heart but her fellow warrior had found love with someone else, a someone none of them had had on the equation. This she had to accept. The race for Ranma's heart was over, and she had lost. But how had hibachan always said? 'Life is strange sometimes. When it throws a lemon your way, make it into lemon-juice.'</p><p><b></b>She wanted to partake in Ranma's life in the future, and if her only options of doing so were as a friend and shield-sister, then she would be the best friend and shield-sister she could be. Sensing that Ranma had politely given her the time to draw her conclusions she looked up and smiled. "I understand your choice, warrior Ranma." she said and noticed how the redheads' brows shot up.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo suppressed the giggle with difficulties, but she had to remain formal. "This one would like to become your shield-sister, warrior Ranma." she said and got to one knee, her head bowed and her bonborries in her hands. "I, warrior Shampoo, humbly request to have the honours of calling the warrior Saotome Ranma my shield sister."</p><p><b></b>Ranma was surprised, honoured and moved at the same time. Wiping away some tears she got down from the counter and dropped to one knee herself and bowed too. "I would be honoured to, warrior Shampoo." she said and her voice conveyed her smile.</p><p><b></b>The blue-haired Amazon smiled a somewhat forced smile. It would be a long time before she had truly come to terms with the loss of her airen, but at least she had gained a shield-sister. With a complicated movement of her arms she bowed once more before Ranma. "Herewith declare I, warrior Shampoo of the Joketsuzoku the warrior Saotome Ranma as my shield sister with the great goddess Aphrodite as my witness. From now on and forever."</p><p><b></b>The redhead smiled at true smile. "Thank you, Shampoo. I knew I could trust you" she said and embraced the other girl in a hug.</p><p><b></b>Moments later they separated and Shampoo smiled. "I have to go now, shield-sister. But I promise to visit you. Zài jiàn." she said and bowed.</p><p><b></b>A relieved Ranma bowed back while Shampoo used the backdoor to make her exit. That had gone better than expected, thought Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Unseen by both of them a wizened old matriarch stood balanced on her staff, hidden from view by a cloaking technique as efficient as the one Happosai had used. <b>'I am proud of you, great-granddaughter. You decided wisely, like the warrior I hoped you to be. Now, finally I can begin to train you for real.' </b></p><p><b></b>And with that cryptic thought Kuh Lon, head matriarch of the Joketsuzoku disappeared into the night.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Soon Nodoka and Soun were ready for departure. Genma had been convinced that accompanying them was out of the question. The Saotome patriarch had had no luck in convincing his wife otherwise and now everyone had congregated at the door that led to the Masaki home, or more accurately, Washu's lab.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked at Nabiki. "I hope you can visit soon, Nabs. And say hi to Akane from me. I'll try to stay clear of trouble but with my life I can guarantee for naught." she said with a lopsided smile.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nodded. "You can say that again, kiddo. And you can be sure that I'll do both of what you requested without a fee. That's what friends do. Besides, this" she reached into one of her pockets, "is my mail-address. Even with you mother going with you I have to catch you up on a lot that happened around Nerima and seeing as you have to get back already this is the best solution. You might have something in your inbox later, Red."</p><p><b></b>The redhead nodded with a smile and embraced the older girl in a hug. "Friends, Nabs. I'd love to stay some more and chat with ya, I really do, but the others are probably waiting for us. And I want to see Kasumi. I'll write you a mail to tell you when you can stop by tomorrow. Should be in your inbox sometime around this evening." she said with a smile as the two girls separated.</p><p><b></b>"You and me both want to see Kasumi, Ranma." Soun Tendo said and laid a hand on her shoulder. That simple gesture showed her that he did not blame her any more for what had happened to his oldest child. "Forgive me for my unthinking comment. I just couldn't bear the thought that something had happened to her… him."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled up at him. "No need to apologise, Mr. Tendo. I know how you feel and I understand." she said. Her unspoken words said 'I feel the same.'.</p><p><b></b>Soun managed a smile too and Nodoka was very proud of her daughter. Her child seemed to have matured a lot lately. Maybe she should have sent her to the Masakis a lot earlier.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi and his two fiancées had stood in the background and had watched the proceedings. Ranma led a very chaotic life indeed, if what had happened today was any indicator. It was absolutely no wonder that she'd needed to get away; and even if it had not been her own idea the fact remained that she needed a normal life. At least more normal than around here and as normal as it could get in a household of aliens. Together with Ryoko and Ayeka he would do his utmost to ensure just that.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka waved a good-bye at Nabiki and Genma. Finally Ranma opened the door and with a last wave she stepped through the vortex and to the other side.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>The first thing Nodoka noticed after she had stepped through the door was the feeling of sliding down… something. There was no description that actually fit the feeling and for a better description the 'ride' was much too short.</p><p><b></b>She had watched the vortex with trepidation and had only stepped into it after Tenchi and the two girls had assured her that it was in fact safe; accepting that and seeing that her daughter had already stepped through she had gathered up her courage and had followed her daughter.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka had however not expected to end up in a comfortable looking room that looked a lot like a room meant for rest &amp; recreation. Her daughter was sitting on a comfortable looking couch and was obviously waiting for her and the rest of the group to arrive. The Saotome matriarch smiled at her daughter and looked around. The room she had arrived in was very large; at least one-hundred square metres, she estimated.</p><p><b></b>Aside from three comfortable looking sofas and a large table it also contained a kitchenette. A large TV-set and a sophisticated looking juke-box stood in one corner of the room; both were hooked up to a surround-system that would have made a rock-band envious. The room even held a pool-billiard table which completed the impression of an r&amp;r room.</p><p><b></b>The next one to arrive was Soun Tendo and he too took his time to look around after he had sorted himself. Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko followed last and when they were through the door closed. Yet another door appeared at the backside of the room and little Washu stepped through. In her hand she carried the control unit for the doors. Pressing a button on it she smiled. "And that ensures that no unauthorised persons will be able to follow…" she muttered.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka looked chagrined at hearing this comment; it seemed as if the stupidity of her husband was well know around here already. If her daughter had told the Masakis everything, and she had good reason to believe that, then her old masters reactions towards her would be… interesting.</p><p><b></b>But she had wanted to see with her own eyes how the love of her child was. Nodoka also simply felt that her child needed her support, and came there hell or high water she would stand by the side of her daughter. She'd missed out so much on her child's life already and even if she was evolving into an independent individual she would be there to offer her help and support whenever her child needed it. "I see you have heard of my husband." she said and attracted the attention of Washu who had been absorbed in adjusting her gadget, "Hello, I'm Nodoka Saotome." she finished with a bow.</p><p><b></b>Washu bowed back. "I'm Washu. But call me little Washu or Washu-chan." she said in a tone of voice that brought across that this was no suggestion. "And yes I have heard of your husband and his deeds."</p><p><b></b>The unspoken message was 'I hope you're better' and Nodoka understood that all too well. They probably also knew about the Seppuku pledge and everything else. From her current point of view and in hindsight on her former behaviour she could not fault them. But as the saying goes, hindsight was always 20/20. "I see." Nodoka finally said with a nod.</p><p><b></b>She had been instructed on how to handle Washu earlier and as she knew the background of Katsuhito aka Yosho it did not come as too great a surprise that Washu was actually a being that was over 20,000 years old. It was however intriguing that Washu did not give herself a more mature appearance regarding her abilities and obvious experience; there had to be a story behind that, Nodoka mused.</p><p><b></b>Soun on his part had been blown out of his chair, especially after Ryoko had demonstrated her abilities outside of the battlefield and offered proof for their stories. Nodoka smiled at the memory. It had taken the Tendo patriarch five minutes to recover from the shock but after that stunning display he'd had no other choice but to believe the stories Tenchi and his fiancées had told him.</p><p><b></b>Thus it was no surprise that Soun was acting a tad bit cautious towards Washu. "Hello, Washu-chan. I am Soun Tendo, the father of Kasumi. I'm pleased to meet you." he said formally and bowed.</p><p><b></b>Washu actually smiled and bowed back. Wasn't it nice to be treated with respect? "Likewise." she said. "Now would you like to see your son? At present he's suspended in one of my regeneration tanks and won't come out until in a few days when the healing process will be completed but you can assess the progress of the healing process."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka, Soun and foremost Ranma all nodded eagerly. Especially the younger redhead was looking forward to see her love again. She had tried to distract herself and to be true a lot of distractions had been offered but her thoughts had kept on returning to her love anyway.</p><p><b></b>The fights aside, up till now practical thoughts like 'I can't help him anyway as long as he's in the tank.' had kept her away from the medical section of the lab but now her want to see him was overwhelming. From minute one on that she knew that he was alive and would survive she'd had the feeling that she could not be without him any more, and now the suppressed feeling came back to the fore with a vengeance.</p><p><b></b>Eager she followed little Washu who had turned around and strode right towards the door she had used a few minutes ago. Opening it she beckoned Nodoka, Soun and Ranma to step through. When she looked at Tenchi he silently communicated that they'd remain behind. And Washu understood. It was for family only.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Ranma had been the first to step through the vortex and she reappeared in the now familiar medical wing of the lab. However it was the proper thing to wait for her mother and Soun. Luckily the two followed with Washu little later and the diminutive scientist led the way.</p><p><b></b>It turned out that the regeneration tanks were placed in another wing of the medical lab and the two women and one man marvelled at the technological wonders Washu had created. Wonders that had helped save the life of Kasumi; and for that they'd always be thankful towards Washu.</p><p><b></b>Finally their voyage through the medical section ended when Washu stepped through a door. Like in so many sci-fi series the doors in the lab opened automatically upon approach and Washu grinned at the surprise and curiosity in the eyes of Nodoka and Soun. She also sensed that the other redhead of the group was getting impatient; it was obvious that Ranma wanted to see Kasumi and thus Washu beckoned the group to follow her.</p><p><b></b>Looking around the group noticed that the walls were practically plastered with regeneration tanks that looked very much like those Ranma was used to from Dragonball Z; it did not take her long to find her love as he was at present the only one to occupy a tank. She was however not prepared to take in the sight that was presented to her.</p><p><b></b>And while she uttered a soft "Oh my!" and was busy keeping her eyes from popping out Soun rushed forward, muttering something to the effect of "My baby!". Ranma however was blushing furiously. Kasumi was in the regeneration tank alright but she had forgotten the simple detail that he was utterly naked! With a deep blush Ranma turned around and her vista was caught by her mother; said mother giggled quietly and she nudged her daughter in the side. "Like what you see, daughter?" she whispered into her ear.</p><p><b></b>"Eep!" Ranma exclaimed. "Mom! I'm a guy!" she protested then, blushing further.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled. Her daughter was so easy to manipulate. "Not at the moment, dear. And I admit that your love is a hunk. Good catch, daughter."</p><p><b></b>That comment only served to deepen the blush further and Ranma felt that she must look like a tomato with sunburn. Why had her mother the unusual talent to embarrass her so easily? Or was it something that all mothers were masters at? With a sigh she had to admit to herself that her mother was right. Her love <i>was</i> a hunk. "I know, mom. I love him and her so much that I think I'll burst to bits. I simply can't imagine a life without Kasumi any more and I dunno how I survived without him."</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Needless to say this caught Soun's attention. He'd had his suspicions as of late but to hear it confirmed in this way… maybe the dream of uniting the schools would come true after all! But Soun had also realised prior to all this that the happiness of his children and of Ranma was more important than joining the schools. It had taken him some time to bring himself to this conclusion but what was the joining of the schools good for if those who joined it did not love each other? In a case like that <i>he</i> could have as good married Ranma, as absurd as that sounded.</p><p><b></b>But now it seemed that love had blossomed between his oldest and Ranma, and gauging from the look on Ranma's face as she looked at his daughter-turned-son he mused that it had hit quite hard; Soun could not help but smile. He knew that look all too well; he'd worn it himself since the day he had fallen in love with his wife and till her untimely death. However he'd never have expected to see that facial expression on the face of the female Ranma. Yes, life was strange sometimes but it seemed that it was paying back a certain Saotome child for what it had thrown its way. And it seemed that payback was a fairy in this case.</p><p><b></b>If Kasumi was as much in love as Ranma, and he had no reason to doubt it he'd have to ensure that Genma remained ignorant. As much as he would have liked to pull out the victory fans and the asserted stuff in order to celebrate with Genma he knew that he could not; sadly his friend had the unhealthy tendency to do, ahem, stupid things and if he knew that Ranma and his daughter-turned-son loved each other he'd pull the stops to get them married right away.</p><p><b></b>Soun had thought long and hard about this as he had hoped that something would happen between the two; the signs had been there and he had been correct. When he'd sat down to think long and hard about the matter he'd thought about what Kasumi and Ranma would wish. He'd put himself into their places; would he have wanted to marry at age 20 respectively 17? Would he want to have children at such an early age in their specific situation?</p><p><b></b>It had been this way for him but nowadays things had changed; with all the realisations that had come as of late he knew without a doubt that Kasumi would want more out of life than just being a housewife; as his son he could go out into the world and attend college, study and so much more. For Ranma it was the same; once her grades got up she'd probably manage to attend college too. She had proven that she could improve vastly and with enough tutoring good grades could be achieved.</p><p><b></b>No, he had concluded, those two would not want to marry right away and he could not fault them; especially Ranma was a burned child after their attempts to marry him/her off to Akane. He'd vowed that he'd not repeat his past mistakes and therefore he'd leave the decision up to the two. Even if it meant keeping his old friend Genma in the dark.</p><p><b></b>Also, who could say if this blossoming love was meant to last? In his opinion it was much too early to tell and in contrast to his former actions he would not take chances any more. These two should find out for themselves and built something from it without constant interference. It had taken him a lot to swallow his pride and admit it, but he had been as guilty in the failed relationship between his youngest and Ranma as anyone else. But he'd vowed to make it better this time.</p><p><b></b>When his look swept over to his man-turned-daughter he felt an odd sense of pride. He had always wished for a son and had been quite sad when his wife and he had been unable to produce one. Of course he was very happy that he had three wonderful and healthy daughters but a specific spot in his heart had remained empty.</p><p><b></b>Empty because of all the things he would never be able to share with a son. When Ranma had arrived he had thought that he'd maybe be able to do these things with him as his future son-in-law but then Ranma had turned out to be a girl. He'd not only been disappointed that the agreement would now not be fulfilled but also because of this other lost chance. Sure, Ranma had turned out to be a boy but he'd forgotten all about his plans.</p><p><b></b>Now looking at Kasumi, in male form, brought all these thoughts to the fore. His new son looked strong and he could see the resemblance with his own father in him, Kasumi's paternal grandfather. And Kasumi, or more accurately Yoshiro had already made him proud. He did not know as of yet what he had done but it must have been something special. Yes, he was proud of his child and he'd do his utmost that Ranma and his child would be unbothered until <i>they</i> decided that it was time to marry.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Shaking himself out of his musings Soun walked over and laid a hand on Ranma's shoulder. "I'm glad that you two have found love together and you don't need to worry; we won't force you to marry. But we'll talk about this later. Now go see my son." he said with an encouraging slap to her back.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was surprised and her face showed it. They were <i>not</i> going to force them to marry? Now that was a new one. She'd have to talk to her mother about that later to find out if that could be trusted; usually her life was never that easy and she did not trust the new peace.</p><p><b></b>Outwardly she just nodded and the happiness that showed on her face was not faked when she walked over to the tank that held the love of her live. Now that she knew what to expect she could stand his appearance; also she had seen her own male form naked on more occasions than she could count. Beside that she had also learned that the body did not really matter but the person inside. She had taken that lesson to heart enough so that she could appreciate both forms of her love.</p><p><b></b>It also helped immensely that he was a hunk. Her mother had been right, her love was a good catch and she was happy to have Kasumi. Thanks to him/her her life had changed drastically in the last few weeks and aside from what had happened yesterday all for the better. If this was all some dream she never wanted to wake up again. To have a mother who had accepted her as she was, to have someone who loved her unconditionally and both forms of her to boot, to have a perspective, a future… what more could she wish for?</p><p><b></b>Smiling she walked over to the tank and stood before it, placing her hands against the glass or whatever this substance was. When she took Kasumi's other form in she was forcefully reminded that she had not given her gender one damn thought in the last 36 hours. Simply too much had happened. It had yet been another surprise when Mr. Tendo had called Kasumi, or rather Yoshiro his son.</p><p><b></b>Apparently he had accepted the curse of his daughter instantly and she mused that she understood at least some reasons; in Japanese culture most men hoped for a male offspring and the curse had given Mr. Tendo one. However she'd have to ensure that he did not forget the female side of Kasumi. But inwardly she wished that her father and mother could have been the same, or her mother at least earlier, for she slowly began to notice the effects the support she experienced now had.</p><p><b></b>She had not once had the urge to change back up till now; that might also have to do with the fact that she'd had three big fights in the last 36 hours, one of them to the death. Also the love of her life had nearly given his life for her and happenings like that made her curse seem… insignificant. Sure, she still missed her birthform and the feelings that came with it but she was getting happier and happier with this body. Especially now that she was training it to become stronger.</p><p><b></b>As she surveyed the sleeping and healing form of her love she mused that this female body she was now wearing was becoming more than a disguise; it was becoming a home to her and began to feel as natural as her birthform. Was that the beginning of what her mother described? Was she now finding out that she was really both sides of the coin now that her fighting this form had ceased? Why was she feeling so much better in this form now?</p><p><b></b>That thought sent her into a mild panic that she might become a complete girl; after all, she'd be a girl from now on, for three whole months! But then she remembered the words of her love that despite which body any of them wore it would still be them inside, Ranma Saotome and Kasumi Tendo. And that would not change regardless of the form. In this form she was a girl, that she began to accept, but she sure as hell still was Ranma Saotome!</p><p><b></b>Her mother must have seen the display of emotions on her face for she came walking towards her and softly hugged her from behind. It was so good to see her mother caring for her like this and she dearly hoped that it would always stay this way. As she was pulled into a hug by the still taller woman she simply relaxed into the comforting embrace. She was totally exhausted, mentally and physically and she liked the feeling of protection the hug gave her; she almost purred when her mother began stroking her hair.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had learned in the past weeks that it was more than okay to rely on others for comfort, especially onto persons you loved; Ranma could nearly feel the pleased smile of her mother when she snuggled deeper into her mothers embrace by leaning backwards. In silence mother and daughter watched the suspended form of one Yoshiro Tendo and both asked themselves the question what the future would bring.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>After one last glance at her love Ranma left the room that held the regeneration tank together with her mother and Mr. Tendo. Little Washu had excused herself in the beginning as she had very important experiments to supervise, as she had said. They all had thanked her once more but Washu had waved it aside and commented that she'd only done what her genius demanded of her and had then returned to another section of her lab.</p><p><b></b>The diminutive scientist had been confident in their abilities to find their way back to the r&amp;r-room. Little Washu had indeed not misplaced her 'faith' in their abilities as Ranma was able to lead them back without a problem. However, the room was utterly empty. Tenchi and the girls must have left to do Kami-sama knows what and little Washu was with high probability still experimenting on something. As soon as they had entered the room they used what it provided and Nodoka made some tea for all of them.</p><p><b></b>With a large cup of tea in her hands and a shrug Ranma sat down on one of the sofas; she had no idea how to make one of those doors and as it was no technique she would have little success in learning how to do it. Thus they could only wait until Washu would come and make one of her doors for them. But the meantime could be used.</p><p><b></b>When Nodoka and Soun Tendo had sat down too the Saotome matriarch called her daughter to order; said daughter was at the moment relaxing on her own couch, her appendages spread wide from her. "Daughter, that is no way to behave in the presence of others. I know you a hard time but that is no excuse to misbehave. So please seat yourself properly." she said with velvet-clad steel in her voice.</p><p><b></b>Ranma obeyed with an internal sigh and heaved her tired body into a sitting position. "Yes, mother."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled while Soun hid a grin as both sipped their teas. In contrast to Genma Nodoka had such an easy time to bring her child to do what she wanted; the Tendo patriarch had always suspected that the reason for this was that Ranma still wanted to prove himself or rather herself to her mother.</p><p><b></b>He suspected that even after more than five months that the two were now interacting with each other Ranma had the urge to get acceptance from her mother. He only hoped that she would not be forced into something that she was not and if so he'd try his utmost to help the young individual that his oldest child loved so much.</p><p><b></b>That gave him a thought; he still did not know what had happened, at least not in detail. "Ranma, could you tell me exactly what has happened to Kasumi, or rather Yoshiro? I know next to nothing about it."</p><p><b></b>Pain flashed over her face for a second but Ranma nodded anyway. With that she launched herself into a detailed explanation of how the Android had attacked and how it had nearly managed to defeat all of them; and that then when it had looked the bleakest and the Android could have blasted her Yoshiro had jumped forward and had taken the blast meant for her. How she had believed that he had been killed due to the fact that he'd had no pulse or breathing and how something in her had snapped; that she had avenged her love and destroyed the tin can utterly.</p><p><b></b>Both Soun and Nodoka were very impressed with the deep feelings that had been displayed on the face of Ranma when she had told the tale; in former times Ranma would never have allowed emotions to escape his/her tight reign over them. It really seemed as if the happenings of the past day had changed the Saotome youth and who could fault her? She had nearly lost what apparently was the love of her life. And Soun had no doubts that the child of Nodoka and Genma loved his oldest child dearly. That had become clear, rapidly.</p><p><b></b>When Ranma had ended she looked at Soun, clearly waiting for judgement. The Tendo patriarch was getting nervous for a moment but when he thought of what the future could bring for the two young individuals his resolve was reaffirmed. "Your story confirms it, Ranma. I was wrong in my thoughtless words for you are not to blame. It was my son, my daughter-turned-son who decided to do what he deemed right. You might have been able to take this blast better yet he decided to shelter you from it. He wanted to save you, to protect you, and this makes me proud. Kasumi has become so much more in the last weeks and I'm sure this is also because of you. Thank you, Ranma, thank you for helping my child." he said and wiped away a tear. "I give you my word that your father will not learn any of this."</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked at Soun, then at Nodoka. The Saotome matriarch was proud of her daughter too, but she was also proud of what the new son of Soun had done. Such an act could only be motivated by great love (or great stupidity, but Nodoka was sure the former was the case here) and should her husband learn of this he'd set all hell in motion to force the two into marriage.</p><p><b></b>Yet Nodoka had understood that these things could not be forced as the failed wedding of Ranma and Akane had impressively proven. No, Genma was not to learn; even though he was not the Head of Clan any more that did not mean that he would not do something incredibly stupid with this knowledge. Sadly Genma was a man of unthinking acts and her top-priority regarding him was teaching him how to think before acting; which would be a Sisyphean-chore in and on itself.</p><p><b></b>But for now she'd enjoy some time with her daughter; sure, she missed her son but she had finally completely accepted in her heart that Ranma was just as much her daughter; a daughter she had never had but always wished for which had made accepting her admittedly easier. Kasumi had brought the point home that the happiness of her child should be her top-priority and she'd been right. The success was already showing as Ranma seemed as comfortable in her form as never before.</p><p><b></b>She was shaken out of her musings by something her daughter had said. "Sorry, Ranma, I did not catch that."</p><p><b></b>Her daughter smiled. "No prob, mom. I said to Mr. Tendo that he should involve pop in teaching in the dojo. Thus the old man would have no time to cook up something."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled before she looked at Soun. "She's right. You wanted to start teaching again anyway and it would keep him on his toes. It might also be just what he needs to learn responsibility. Of course, I'll ensure that he won't step out of the line."</p><p><b></b>Ranma was torn between snickering and pitying her father for his fate. To have mom on his case with her katana would surely not be his dream; rather the opposite. Oh yes, her mother could indeed be scary and damn intimidating. <b>'Woe behold thee, pops.'</b> she thought amusedly. Finally she gave into snickering which then turned into full-blown giggles.</p><p><b></b>At first both adults were surprised to hear giggles from Ranma but then both remembered that this was normal for a girl. Nodoka smiled at her daughter. "What is so funny, Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>The redhead put her head into her hands and took a few calming breaths to help her recovery. "Mom, I just had the mental image of you disciplining pop with your katana for fouling up in training and him running away from you like a chicken. That was so funny!" she exclaimed and wiped away tears.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka's smile became wolfish. "Yes, I could imagine that husband will need the one or the other pointer, won't he? Maybe he will also loose his excess weight if he does indeed choose to run…" she mused with a grin.</p><p><b></b>Soun sent a quick prayer to Kami-sama on his old friends' behalf while Ranma barely resisted the urge to scramble away from her mother. She was wearing the same look she'd always worn when she'd ranted on about her being manly. Scary! But at least it was not projected on her. "Eh heh heh, sure, mom! Mom, I have a few questions about some promises Master Katsuhito made to you." she said. Seeing her mother's facial expression she nodded. "Yes, I know of them…"</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found down below.

I'm glad that you like it, and thanks for the compliment. As for news on updates, why don't you check my yahoo group? It holds the latest news on updates and such. The link is in my homepage link.</p><p><b>Gate</b>: Thanks for doing so, but as I said before, nobody forces you to read or like my story; I freely admit that I didn't own much in the way of Ranma ½ mangas in the beginning, but now I own all of them. I admit that I used a lot of clichés that are commonly accepted in fandom, but I also expanded on them and used my own ideas. If you don't like it, well, I can't please everyone.<br/>As to how my story acquired a good amount of reviews and if it deserves it, I don't know. I don't judge my own story, I write for the fun of it and for the betterment of my skills; therefore feedback is needed and greatly appreciated. And it's good to see that there're a lot of people out there who're willing to help me point out mistakes and who give encouragement, feedback and suggestions; I can't thank them enough for it. But thanks for giving me the web-address; it's good to have a quick and easy access handy.</p><p><b>Ranko</b>: Thank you. I like to think that I did a good job on the fight, though I'm not that satisfied with it; I'll prolly make changes to it and a revision and make it harder for Ranma to win. Hope the chapter met up with expectations. And I'll try to keep it up.</p><p><b>Rejhan</b>: I know what you mean. That name sucks, and its no wonder that he wants it changed. But you're right, he shouldn't take it out on Ranma. But then again, it was business as usual to do that in Nerima. However, I'd say that Ranma proved that these times are over. Glad that you liked the fight, and here's more.</p><p><b>borg rabbit</b>: No prob, Wes. And thanks. Also, once more thanks for the corrections/improvements. I greatly appreciate it.</p><p><b>mystery person</b>: Hmm, I suppose you're right; a bit more melee can't hurt. Will prolly do it in a revision.</p><p><b>goldfighter</b>: Glad that you liked it. Here's more.</p><p><b>Boku wa boku dayou!</b>: Yeah, it seemed I suffered from a spontaneous attack of word-confusion. Thanks for pointing that out.</p><p><b>AzureSky123</b>: Thank you. Yeah, Ranma should have done that, but knowing Ranma's life, Taro would have ignored it later anyway…</p><p><b>Lord Oberon</b>: Thanks. Glad that you liked the fight, and I hope I met up with expectations you had in this chapter. Will try to keep it up.</p><p><b>.</b>: Glad you think so.</p><p><b>trunks and goten</b>: Thank you, I'm glad that you enjoyed it. I liked to write the fight, but I might modify it in a rewrite and make it a bit harder for Ranma to win. But I bet you could so as good. Well, I'll try to keep it up, and here's the next.</p><p><b>Jerry Unipeg</b>: Glad that you loved the chapter and the fight. And right you are, but some people are just too stubborn to learn, and when it comes to bullheadedness Taro takes the fruitcake. Though I'd like to see him getting his wish.</p><p><b>James Axelrad</b>: Yeah, I haven't changed much. Only this time around I have left it open if Genma married into the Saotome clan or Nodoka, plus a few other things. And rest assured, I'll use your suggestions.</p><p><b>TheWhiteMonk</b>: That he is, and I agree with your assessment. Pardon the fun, but he's just too bullheaded and obsessed with changing his name. And for exactly the reasons you mentioned his quest is illogical, and he goes off the deep end even though Ranma tried to help him several times. But you're right, it would be funny to lock Taro and Happi in a room, Taro preferably in his cursed form. If I got the time I might explore his character, if not within this story then maybe in one of my others. I'll try to keep it up.</p><p><b>gatodepatasblancas</b>: As said in the mail, it might have been a temporary server error. As of now everything is accessible once more.</p><p><b>MarshmellowDragon</b>: That I am. Hmm, as for the yahoo group, just use the homepage link. If you want to browse old review answers, you can read them there. Its also a discussion and newsboard.<br/>Good that you were just kidding. You had me worried there for a moment. :) Bob Taro just sounds… nah.<br/>Hmm, hope Sarki was successful and didn't get liberated of her silky darlings… uh oh, I think not even Happi would be that stupid. To have an angry female Saiyan on your tail… not good. Hmm, that gives me ideas for my other story…</p><p><b>kzinti7</b>: Thank you. Its quite hard from time to time to tweak it in a way so that one group does not get pushed into the background, and I like to think I'm doing a good job.</p><p><b>Rose Vaughn</b>: Thanks, Ash. And here's the next, although you had it ahead of time, as usual.</p><p><b>Duke</b>: You can say that again; and we will see a real fight of Ranma against Happi were the two will go all out. The fight in Ch. 27 was merely a warm-up in which Ranma managed to surprise Happi. As for Shampoo and Mousse, IMO it only makes sense that they try to do so; hope the talk between Ranma and Shampoo was satisfying.</p><p><b>Eric Thorsen</b>: Glad that you think so. And yeah, we have covered Nerima and will be returning to Okayama as of now.</p><p><b>ss4-link</b>: Thanks. Hmm, Happi will be training, now that he knows how much better and stronger Ranma has become. Will try my best to keep it up.</p><p><b>Bobboky</b>: Glad that you liked it. And err, I did? Hmm, can't remember… must have drunken too much coffee or something… odd. And yup, it is. :)</p><p><b>Slade13</b>: Yeah, I thought it might show that fact; and you're right, I don't like it either if someone becomes impossibly strong without even having to do something for it. Power and strength has to be acquired through training, and Ranma will have to train hard, along with the others. I agree with you, Ranma wouldn't accept a power-boost if someone offered him something like that; power and strength through training or through some coincidence or accident, but otherwise, no. And without giving too much away, you got that right; it was Sasuke.</p><p><b>Wonderbee31</b>: Thanks. Tenchi &amp; co just had to see what Ranma's everyday life is like in Nerima. Yeah, Akane was like that in the series, but I think she was this way because she was jealous of the others. And she also feared that Ranma could give in to them, at least IMO. But both are to blame, as both were just too stubborn, prideful and insecure to admit their love. Though IMO a relationship between the two would not have ended well; one of the most important things in a relationship beside the necessary mutual attraction and love is trust. And Akane never trusted Ranma.<br/>What I greatly disliked that she seemed to think that Ranma deserved all the bad things that happened to him. Ranma is just a too-good-for-this-world guy with an unusual talent of attracting trouble. But yet everyone, including Akane blamed him for everything. Too sad.</p><p><b>JohnnyG</b>: Glad that you liked it. As for Kasumi, that will be some more chapters seeing as a lot is going to happen in the next few days/chapters. But rest assured, I'll try to hurry it up as well try to keep it up.</p><p><b>Martrex</b>: Thank you. One tends to overlook Taro as he only appeared so seldom in the manga, but when he did… hoh boy. As for some decent injuries for those who won't lay off, I'll see what I can do.</p><p><b>Silverscale</b>: Thanks. Damn, now that's really bad luck. I hope your wrist heals fast. I know how irritating it is not to be able to write as much as you want; I was in a similar situation some months ago. Jet my wrist was only cracked at that time…</p>
