</div><p><b>Title</b>: A trip to self</p><p><b>Author name</b>: Trugeta</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by Rumiko Takahashi and VIZ as well as Kajishima Masaki and many others. No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 21: Truth revealed</b></p><p><b></b>It was Katsuhito who looked at Ranma while the other members of the Masaki household were still stunned. Silently the old Shinto Priest chided himself. He should have known that Ranma-chan would notice sooner or later what with her ability to sense auras. "Ranma, you are right when you say that our auras are not those of normal humans. Actually without the exception of my grandson Tenchi none of us are of this world."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. She had suspected something like this from her scan of their auras. She had had her first clues in her fight against Ryoko when her ki had not really felt like ki from planet earth. After the fight she had had enough time to make some examinations. Their auras were simply too strange and that the members of the Masaki household were indeed aliens was the most logical explanation. To her that was not too strange to believe; not after what she'd encountered in her life.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko whereas was blown of his feet. Good thing that he was still sitting. "You mean to say that you... you are <i>aliens</i>?" he asked with wide eyes, his whole posture screaming out his disbelief. Unconsciously he reached for the hand of his girlfriend and grabbed it, clinging to it as if it was the only thing that anchored him in this reality. Ranma who was not nearly as surprised as he gave his hand a firm squeeze and jiggled closer to him in order to show him that she was there for him. Whatever would happen they would stand together. Forever.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded and consciously projected and aura of peace and candour. "Yes, Kasumi. That we are. But not what you'd actually expect from the movies." he said with a smile before sobering up again.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi butted in with a smirk before his grandfather could continue. "Don't worry you two. I'm not descended from a facehugger or something. If I were I'd probably killed myself already. But rest assured that I'd never bite my best friend or her… boyfriend even if I <i>were</i> related to such a creature." he said with a smile; though one could hear from the tone of his voice that he was still getting used to the fact that his best childhood friend was now a very pretty girl who had another gender-changing individual as a lover. Both cursed individuals noticed this but they knew that he'd just need time to accept this reality; though it would probably be much easier for him than it had been for Ranma's mother for example.</p><p><b></b>"Though I'd not mind if he'd bite me…" Ryoko muttered quietly but loud enough to be heard.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi blushed and returned to the matter at hand with some effort. "To be honest I was as surprised as you two are now when I learned of my heritage. It was all just too overwhelming; though I got used to it after some time. But believe me the Juraians are good people." he said with conviction.</p><p><b></b>Ranma and even Kasumi-otoko had had to smile at his joke about the Gaijin movie 'Alien' and both were eager to learn more after the initial shock had worn off. Little did they two know that several more shocks would follow soon…</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto priest smiled at the two curse-victims before he continued. "Everything that I or the others will tell you is the whole truth, as incredible and impossible it may sound. So please bear with me."</p><p><b></b>Both Ranma and Kasumi nodded as the old Shinto priest paused to breathe. "It all began 700 years ago when I, at that time Yosho of the house Jurai of planet Jurai chased after the infamous space pirate Ryoko."</p><p><b></b>For a second Ranma could have sworn that Katsuhito aka Yosho had said 700 years ago. No, she must have heard wrong. Then she looked at Katsuhito, afterwards at Ryoko and then back again. "Did you say Ryoko? As in <i>this</i> Ryoko up there?"</p><p><b></b>Said Ryoko looked sad for a moment; then she floated down to the ground and stood before where Ranma sat. "Yeah. It was me. And I want ta… ta say sorry for what I called ya. I compared ya to an asshole from my past and shouldn't have." she said and the redhead could hear how hard it was for the other girl to utter these words</p><p><b></b>To say that everyone else safe Kasumi-otoko was surprised would have been an injustice to the meaning of the word understatement. Everyone except Ranma and Kasumi-otoko had facefaulted. Ranma whereas smiled. "That's okay. No harm done." she said with a smile. "But as ya see I'm really not here to steal Tenchi from any of ya. I'm already taken." she said with an even deeper smile as she jiggled even closer to her boyfriend.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko nodded, now finally convinced that Ranma would indeed not be competition for her Tenchi; feeling relieved she sat down on the empty seat beside Ranma and made herself comfortable. Then the old Shinto Priest continued to tell his tale. "Ryoko and I crashed into the Earth and both our spaceships were destroyed in the process. After a long and tiring battle I managed to imprison Ryoko here in a cave in the Masaki shrine. After that and because my spaceship was destroyed I decided to live out the rest of my life here on Earth. I then changed my name to Katsuhito. To be honest, if a search party from Jurai ever came to investigate I wanted them to stumble upon a dead end. I know it may sound selfish but I wanted to start anew, which I did." he said.</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto priest paused to take a breath. "At first I travelled far and wide but then I met my wife and settled down; it's interesting how Fate plays for I never would've thought that I'd find the love of my life on a planet that was considered to be backwater at best. Together we had a daughter named Achika and she was the pride and joy of my life." he said and paused for a moment to gather himself again.</p><p><b></b>Despite the fact that he had good control over his emotions it still hurt Katsuhito to talk about his deceased daughter even after all this time; both Ranma and Kasumi noticed this and even the mostly clueless Ranma refrained from asking. "My daughter Achika married Nobuyuki later on, my son-in-law, and together they had Tenchi." he said with a proud smile at his grandson. "You will come to know Nobuyuki later on; at this time he's on an architects' convention or something to that effect."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko and Ranma presented warding signs. To say that both were very weirded out would have been a gross understatement. "Jurai? Spaceships?"</p><p><b></b>Then Ranma managed to sort her thoughts and gather her bearings somewhat while Kasumi-otokos' eyes were still spiralling. After all, Ranma had seen a lot of <i>very</i> weird things in her life. Thus aliens from other planets were nothing that unbelievable. Especially when they were so nice. There was also more than enough proof in their auras. They were most definitely not human despite their looks. "And where and what is this Jurai?" she finally asked with real curiosity.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka's chest swelled with pride and she wanted to answer but Katsuhito forestalled it. <i>He</i> would make the talk and his half-sister got the message. "Jurai is a planet some distance away and the centre of the Juraian Empire. Washu here could show you a space-chart to give you a more accurate impression. The House of Jurai is, as said, an Empire in which great power is wielded by its family members through mysterious trees, the space trees. Don't worry, I'll explain about them later." he said at seeing their looks.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito took in a deep breath and continued the tale of Jurai. "With this power and the help of the Goddess Tsunami we Juraians have laid claim to the largest territory in the Galactic Union. While the number of planets the Juraian Empire controls is small the resources we command are tremendous. The resources of my homeworld have been invaluable for our rise to power. You see, nearly three quarters of my homeworld is covered by vegetation and species which are used for many purposes including shipbuilding and defence. As you will have guessed the vegetation of my homeworld is no ordinary one by any stretch of imagination. As for Earth, our chosen home, well Earth is included in Jurai's domain and is actually a subject planet to the Juraian Empire."</p><p><b></b>"What?" both Ranma and Kasumi-otoko exclaimed. "Earth is a subject planet of another planet!" Kasumi-otoko added.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito nodded. "Yes, Earth was actually a colony of Jurai a long time ago; to be vaguely precise some thousand years ago. But you'll need to know more. Well, Juraian roots can be traced to long before the current intergalactic government's existence so it should not come as a surprise that we colonised Earth so long ago."</p><p><b></b>Ranma presented warding signs at that. "Inter… intergalactic government? One sec… there's an inter<i>galactic</i> government? Holy Kami-sama… just how many alien races <i>are</i> there in the universe?" she asked incredulous.</p><p><b></b>It was Ryoko who answered. "More than you would believe, Red." she said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka nodded. "But not all of them are friendly; some are downright dangerous and would love nothing more but to invade, raid and exploit planets like Earth. Needless to say that they'd kill all of Earth's population to satisfy their needs. Thus the Galactic Union was formed to protect and serve its people. Earth has not reached the technological level to become a full member as of yet and the population has yet to find out about alien life. I suspect that some of the national governments may know but Earth still has a long way to go. In my opinion it will be several hundred years before Earth will become a full member of the Galactic Union."</p><p><b></b>The cursed individuals slowly absorbed this. Kasumi-otoko who had gathered his bearings again was fascinated. "What are the criteria for full membership in the Galactic Union?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi grinned. "As funny as that may sound, but a race that wants to become a member has at least to have developed the theoretical and practical model of a warp-drive." he said. At seeing their looks he nodded. "Yes, just like in Star Trek. Most of the technology you see there in the series actually exists. The Juraian Empire, for example, has lots of battle fleets which would make the fleet of the Federation in Star Trek pale in comparison."</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko boggled while Ayeka had a decidedly proud expression on her face. "That is why Earth is a protectorate at the moment. This planet has valuable resources and a lot of potential but it can not defend itself as of yet; you surely understand that this unfortunate situation would make it an ideal target for many of the more… dangerous races in the known universe. Which is exactly why the Galactic Union or to be more precise the Juraian Empire does just that; in essence we defend this planet from external threats. To forestall your question, our militia has stationed several cloaked battle cruisers within the solar system. Those are capable to deal with anything that should cross their path." she said with confidence.</p><p><b></b>Washu who had been listening knew differently but it made little sense to scare their guests. For should her sister Tokimi decide to take war to their doorstep to advance her own plans those ships would offer little help. She also knew that Tokimi was up to something, for she had sensed it for the longest time yet. She was also quite certain that her sister was behind the actions of Dr. Clay. But as said it would not do to worry their guests.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito had noticed her look and resumed his tale. "Now to some historic background on the Juraians. Thousands of years ago several noble families formed a great pirate guild after losing their thrones to various parties. The first leader of this guild was an ancestor of the modern Juraians. These families slowly intermarried and adopted a more conventional lifestyle and eventually they became the House of Jurai. The <i>planet</i> Jurai is the most powerful planet in the universe in regards of political influence and military might; at the moment, at least and as far as we know. The leaders of my home planet are basically the rulers of everything but they aren't dictators. As far as I know from my admittedly somewhat outdated experience each ruler tries to be kind and compassionate and gauging from what Ayeka has told me and from our experiences we made during the visit of our relatives they still are. Then there are the Juraian trees I mentioned and which still are a mystery to even us of Jurai. What I tell you now may be a bit much to take in but it is the full truth."</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko nodded dumbly; both were still holding hands and looked quite… overwhelmed. Earth, a former colony of another planet and now a subject planet? Oh my!</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito continued. "Where was I? Ah yes, the trees of Jurai. These trees are very special for they are a self-aware plant species found only on my home planet. They have a will and power of their own and are distinguished by generation. Tsunami, the goddess of Jurai is the origin of all trees and she is one of the most powerful beings in the universe. But I or maybe Sasami will tell you more about her later. My own tree, Funaho, is a first generation offspring. Ayeka's tree," he waved over to his half-sister "Ryu-oh is a second generation. The members of the Royal family are all partnered with trees during a special ceremony which has certain effects as enhancing their life-span to near immortality for example. The trees provide energy, keep memories and can communicate over long distances for their partners. Then there is the fact that Juraians such as me and Ayeka have special powers. But more about this later."</p><p><b></b>The cursed individuals on the couch still tried to grasp all this. "Intelligent trees? A goddess? Special powers? Oh my!" Ranma exclaimed in an eerie imitation of Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>The old Shinto Priest nodded. "If you want to you can see Funaho later. He is planted back in the garden. But now to the matters at hand. Ayeka here is my half-sister. She is also the first crown princess of the planet Jurai." Then he smiled. "She actually came to Earth because she was chasing after Ryoko who she believed had killed me. This is going to sound weird now but bear with me. I... was Ayeka's fiancé back at this time." he said with a slight smile.</p><p><b></b>At this Ranma and Kasumi-otoko boggled again. Half-sister and half-brother as fiancées?</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito saw their looks and he could not hide an amused smile for he knew exactly what they were thinking. "You must know, planet Jurai has two queens. Ayeka is the daughter of one and I am the son of the other though I am only half Juraian and half human. For Jurai family members it is not the least bit uncommon to marry each other, contrary to Earth customs. For us Juraians there is no danger of incest as our genetic structures or our DNA, to be more proficient, is adequately protected. Anyway, Ayeka was chasing down Ryoko and her spaceship was destroyed in the process which forced her to crashland on Earth. That's why she is here. At first she did not know it was me, her half-brother who was living here right before her nose under a disguise field but she eventually found out. Now she is my grandson's fiancée. Tenchi, if you want..." he said and extended his hand.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi nodded, and the cursed individuals looked at him. "Of course, grandfather." he said with a smile. "As Yosho's grandson I inherited all of his Juraian powers. In essence I am one eighth Juraian and seven eighth human. I found out about all this after I had accidentally freed Ryoko," his look promised an explanation later, "and when the girls literally came flying into this house things got really interesting. Now after several adventures and interesting turns I am a member of the Juraian royal family; and as a Juraian I also have several special powers. The most prominent is that I can create something called the 'Lighthawk Wings'. And I'll give you a demonstration later, Ranma, promised." he said at the look he saw in Ranma's eyes. "But now let me tell you something about what we went through..."</p><p><b></b>With that he began to weave the story of his life and Ranma and Kasumi-otoko had instantly the feeling that Tenchi and the others had led as interesting lives as they had, if not even more so. Finally Tenchi came to a topic that interested Ranma very much as the young man talked about what had happened with Ryoko in more detail. And the ex-space pirate cringed in anticipation of what was to come.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi noticed her discomfort and gave her an encouraging smile; then he began his story with Ryoko's attack on the planet Jurai because Kagato had wanted to capture the power of Tsunami; he also briefly mentioned that something had happened to Sasami there and then without going into details, then he detailed the battle on Jurai, the adjacent race across space which finally ended in the crash-landing on Earth. He did not have to cover more of this as Katsuhito had done this already.</p><p><b></b>Thus he then detailed his accidental wakening of Ryoko as his look had promised prior and described their first encounter. Needless to say that both Ranma and Kasumi-otoko were spellbound to hear of the adventures they had lived through.</p><p><b></b>Then came Ayeka's subsequent arrival. After that he explained how Mihoshi had come to live with them and how she had found Washu on Kagato's ship later on by sheer luck. As he talked the girls also related their own stories and how they had been involved in all this.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi talked about Kagato and his extreme powers and how he had nearly died fighting him but had been saved by Tsunami, and how he had first accessed the Lighthawk Wings and how incredible that had felt. He described the sword, the amour and the shield he had formed with the wings and promised again that a practical demonstration would follow tomorrow.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded but now she really wanted to know who this Tsunami, the Goddess of Jurai was. "Tenchi, you said that you'd explain about Tsunami later on but I'd really like to know about her. I know that there're Kami so I won't doubt your explanation. I've experienced so much in my life that a Goddess who protects a far away planet does not sound odd at all." she said with a smile.</p><p><b></b>The raven-haired boy looked at Katsuhito, then Washu and Sasami and all three nodded. Now was as good an opportunity as later. "Okay, Ranma. To give you the most complete picture I'll start at the beginning. You've already made your experiences with Kami as we know from your story. Tsunami is one of three Goddesses <i>we</i> know of. Tsunami's physical form is that of a gigantic tree. We do not know if this is her original form but it is the form she appears in on Jurai. Actually Tsunami is the first generation of Jurai's battleships. All other spaceship trees including Ayeka's Ryu-Oh and Yosho's Funaho are descendents from Tsunami. As with all other spaceship trees Tsunami has a key. This key is only given to Juraian royalty. Tsunami's key is called Tenchiken and is the sword which I own and guard with my life. Because this key comes from the first generation tree it can control other spaceship trees and has been given the name "The Master Key". Anyone from the Juraian Royal Family can use the key to override control over any other spaceship tree. Even if somebody else is using the tree's key." he said and paused to take a breath.</p><p><b></b>"Tsunami is very powerful and she has a great amount of love for the Juraian people. With her watching over the Empire the Juraians they have ascended to the most powerful empire in the galaxy as you already learned. The Juraians even cultivate trees made from the seeds of Tsunami to make their spaceship trees; very powerful ones I might add. The children of Tsunami's power are only rivalled by the power of our little Ryo-Ohki here."</p><p><b></b>Both Ranma and Kasumi-otoko looked at the little cabbit with their brows in their hairlines; Ryo-Ohki who was enjoying a petting by Sasami looked decidedly smug. The little Princess looked at them and smiled and both cursed individuals smiled back before looking at Tenchi again. Smiling too he continued. "Ryo-Ohki is much more than she seems to be. Originally she has been created by our resident genius Washu; our little Ryo-Ohki here has the ability to turn into a real live spaceship, and one of the strongest in the entire galaxy to boot. Basically she has all the functions the spaceships in the sci-fi series have… laser, rockets, shields and so on. But back to Tsunami and the tree ships. An average spaceship tree has three Lighthawk Wings. Tsunami whereas has ten; this is why she is the flagship of the Juraian Empire. However she is not under the command of a Juraian captain. The closest thing to a commander that she has is Sasami. And that is for a reason. If you want, Sasami…"</p><p><b></b>The little Princess looked up from her activity and nodded. From one moment to the next her whole posture seemed much more mature than should be possible and both Ranma and Kasumi were astounded at the transformation. "As Tenchi said something happened when Ryoko attacked Jurai. All without her free will! Both Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki had been forced to attack Jurai so that Kagato could get his hands on Tsunami's power. During the heat of the battle I was staying in the garden where the spaceship trees were being grown. A battleship outside was shot down and crashed into the building. All I remember is that I was knocked off the platform and I knew for certain that I was falling to my death." she said with emotions visible on her face.</p><p><b></b>The else so cool and regal Ayeka drew her closer, not caring how that looked. All that she wanted was to comfort her younger sister and to hell with the protocol. Sasami was very thankful and moments later she had calmed down enough to continue her tale. "While I was lying there with mere moments left in this life some of my blood entered an irrigation canal that was connected to Tsunami. She sensed somehow that my life was fading and Tsunami used her power to assimilate me into herself. The result was that Tsunami, the Goddess of Jurai and I became one being. I know that may sound confusing but until I have matured enough we will remain two separate entities. But Tsunami is with me, always." she finished with a smile. "She also can't wait to meet you in person, Ranma. She likes you." she said with a giggle.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part smiled weakly. "I only hope that my next meeting with a Kami goes better than the last…" she muttered quietly.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito decided to carry on with the conversation; in his book Ranma and Kasumi were worthy to know everything. "The bonding with Sasami also had an unforeseen side-effect. It gave Tsunami a physical body. Like Ryo-Ohki she can switch from tree- or ship-form to her physical form at will. Only a select few know this and we who know keep it a secret."</p><p><b></b>Both Ranma and Kasumi exchanged a look and nodded. "We'll keep all of your secrets and swear on our honour that we won't betray your trust." the redhead said for the two of them while the oldest Tendo child affirmed this with a nod.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi smiled. "We know that, you two. If you had not been trustworthy we would have known. But back to the story. As said, Tsunami can form ten wings of the Lighhawk. I promised you a demonstration what my three wings can do and after that you'll have an idea just how powerful Tsunami really is. Then there're the two other Goddesses. Washu, if it's okay with you…"</p><p><b></b>The redheaded scientist smiled. "Thanks for trying to spare my feelings Tenchi but I'll cover my part of the story myself. In order to understand things properly let me recite an old scroll of Jurai to you: 'In the beginning, there were three goddesses of the planet Jurai. The eldest was Tokimi, given to the Darkness. The youngest was Tsunami, bound to the ways of the Light. The middle goddess was inclined to both the Light and the Dark, and, thus, was the most human of the three. This goddess' name was Washu.' Yes," she said at noticing the looks Kasumi and Ranma were giving her, "I am or was a Goddess."</p><p><b></b>"Was?" Ranma asked.</p><p><b></b>Washu nodded. "As I found out some time ago I sealed my memories and powers away on my own decision a long time ago and decided to live as a human. I won't go into the details but some very bad things happened to me over time and I decided that the body of a child would suit me better. You have already heard that I had been trapped by Kagato, who was my former apprentice on the science council. Sadly I never noticed his true colours and the bastard, excuse my language, managed to trap me within one of my own inventions, a large crystal within the mirror dimension of Soja, Kagato's ship, which I had ironically invented myself, too. I was only released by chance when Mihoshi here," at that the blonde smiled cutely, "accidentally released me from my prison. Ever since then I have been living here and enjoy being the most creative genius scientist in the universe." she finished.</p><p><b></b>Unsurprisingly Ranma and Kasumi-otoko were awed. "Wow! I'd never have thought." the redhead exclaimed and her love nodded his assent. "The stories of your lives are really more enthralling than many a fantasy book I read." he added.</p><p><b></b>The members of the Masaki household smiled at this. They had indeed not lived normal lives, that was for sure. Tenchi grinned once more at Ranma before he sobered up again. Then he explained the events with Zero and Dr. Clay without going into the details too much. Finally he told them about the visit of the Juraian royalty. "And for the next year or so not much happened; we had the occasional smaller incident but nothing really major." he concluded.</p><p><b></b>"Wow!" was all Ranma could exclaim when Tenchi had ended and Kasumi-otoko could only nod. "Your life has been as crazy as mine but the stakes have never been so high in my case. I never had to fight people who wanted to blow up planets! Granted Saffron probably could have but he never wanted to!"</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo nodded. "I would say 'Oh my' if that were not unmanly. So you are a Princess, Sasami?" he asked the little girl. That bit of information had been related through Tenchi while he had explained things.</p><p><b></b>Sasami set up her most regal face. "Yes, I am Sasami Jurai, the second crown Princess of the planet Jurai. Daughter to Azusa, the King of Jurai and Misaki, the Queen of Jurai. Sister to Ayeka. Of course everyone is awed by the magnificence of my presence..."</p><p><b></b>Then she could not keep up the façade any longer and erupted into helpless giggles which soon infected the whole room. After she had control of her breathing once more Ranma exclaimed "C'mere, you!" and playfully lunged at Sasami who ran away giggling. Seconds later Ranma had captured Sasami and was playfully tickling the younger girl, laughing freely all the while.</p><p><b></b>Everyone smiled at the carefree display; most of all Kasumi-otoko who just loved to see his Ranma act so light-hearted. Even though he missed Nerima and his family it <i>had</i> been the right decision to come here. Here Ranma could be just herself and would actually have the chance to find herself.</p><p><b></b>In Nerima everyone had a certain picture and assumptions of his love but here she could have a fresh start. Here in Okayama she would hopefully have the occasion to be a normal teenager for once. Granted, as far as a super-powered martial artist could pass as a normal teenager. But a weak ago Ranma would never have been so outgoing; it was an indicator that the stress she had been under was slowly ebbing away. It really seemed as if things were slowly looking up; in Kasumi's book it was about time, too.</p><p><b></b>Seconds later Sasami had conceded defeat and Ranma helped the younger girl to her feet. Then the little princess engulfed the larger girl in a hug. "That was fun, Ranma-chan!" the little girl exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist smiled. "I am honoured, your highness." she said and dropped a curtsy just like she had seen someone do on some occasion some time ago on the TV in some royal ceremony.</p><p><b></b>Needless to say the whole room erupted in laughter again when Sasami looked down on Ranma in a patronising way. Afterwards Ranma and Sasami sat down again and smiled at each other. Kasumi-otoko ruffled his girl-friends hair and gave her a kiss while Sasami played with Ryo-Ohki.</p><p><b></b>Finally Katsuhito looked at the young cursed individuals. "Now you know our stories. What do you say?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma just shrugged. "Not stranger than what I have come to know. Heck, I have fought an immortal Phoenix god! Aliens are not too unbelievable after that. As for the other part about Goddesses and space-ships and stuff… we'll need some time to get used to that. But after what I have seen of you, Ryoko, and after looking at your auras I am sure that you told us the truth. To be honest I actually felt that something was different in my fight with you, Ryoko. The ki you used felt… different." she said and the cyan-haired woman nodded. "I can say that I trust you and I am sure that Kasumi does too." Ranma said while looking at Kasumi-otoko who nodded. "We will keep it a secret, this I swear on my honour as a martial artist!"</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded. "What my love said is right. I admit that I am very surprised at those revelations but Ranma is right. After what we have come to see in Nerima aliens are nothing unexpected. Especially when they are so nice aliens. I, too, swear on my honour that I will keep your secret."</p><p><b></b>The members of the Masaki household looked relieved and happy. One look at those two showed that they could be trusted, and they were more than happy to have them here. "Welcome to the Masaki family, Ranma, Kasumi!" Tenchi exclaimed and everyone cheered.</p><p><b></b>After they had all settled down again Washu piped up. "After all that you two have heard I am sure that it is enough for one day. But you should know the full story of my daughter, Ryoko. She is the same Ryoko Yosho here," she pointed at Katsuhito, "chased to Earth where they both crashed. Know however that she did not act of her own free will at that time. You have heard how Yosho imprisoned my daughter here in the Masaki Shrine. At this time she was under the control of Kagato who was one of the most dangerous pirates in existence. There and then she was heartless, rampaging, violent and committed a lot of atrocities. All not of her own free will." she said and paused for breath.</p><p><b></b>"When Yosho here captured and imprisoned her it also broke her free of Kagato's will. 700 years later Tenchi here released her, even if unwittingly. All the crimes she has committed are now time-barred and you can believe me when I tell you that she deeply regrets what she did under Kagato's control." At this Ryoko nodded very forcefully. "Even though she did not know what she did and could do nothing to stop it there is not one day that she does not wish to have the power to undo what she did." Washu finished.</p><p><b></b>Now Ryoko who was very thankful that her mother had told her story for her was anxiously awaiting the reactions of the two newcomers. She feared that they would reject her but this fear evaporated at the facial expression of Ranma.</p><p><b></b>For said Ranma looked angry. And to the surprise of Ryoko, not at her. "Excuse my language, Ka-kun, but what kind of bastard was this Kagato to use Ryoko this way? She is an intelligent being and no freakin' toy! What a heartless bastard! Good riddance ta bad rubbish I'd say!" she exclaimed and looked directly at Ryoko. "Ya know ya made me a bit mad what with the insults ya threw at me but believe me when I say that yer're no monster. I fought those and yer're much too nice ta be one."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko hardly noticed how her own face lit up in a smile. She had not only been not rejected but Ranma had defended her and taken her position! "T… thanks, Red." she said in an uncharacteristic bout of emotionality before switching back to her jovial mask. "Yer're not so bad either."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled. "You're welcome. But I'm still gonna whoop your ass in our next match!" she exclaimed with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko got up too and mirrored the smile. "You wish, Red. It will be me who's gonna whoop yer ass!"</p><p><b></b>"We're gonna see about that, demon woman." Ranma countered. At seeing Ryoko's surprised look she elaborated. "That's my nick for you." she said playfully.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko nodded with a slight smirk.<br/>"Demon woman, huh? Well I'd say that fits me." she stated and patted Ranma on the back. "But don't expect this Demon woman ta hold back on ya." she teased.</p><p><b></b>The redhead smirked at her. "Don't expect me to either. I'm gonna pound ya so bad the last match will look like a walk in the park." she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Both women then smirked at each other; Ryoko had decided for herself that Ranma's stay at the house could indeed be fun. Finally she'd have someone against whom she wouldn't have to hold back against. And she still had the one or the other trick up her sleeve she hadn't used against Ranma in their first fight. Oh yes this was going to be a world of fun the cyan-haired woman thought with a mischievous smirk.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had reached the same conclusion; she would not say that they were friends (Kami-sama forbid!) but Ryoko would definitely be someone she'd trust to guard her back in a battle. Oh yes their stay at the Masaki's could prove to be fun indeed.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi on his part was glad that the initial tension between Ranma and Ryoko seemed to have evaporated. If he was to hazard as guess the relationship between the two could develop quite like the one Ranma and Ryoga shared; but without the hate the fanged boy had felt for Ranma. This stage had luckily been overcome already in Ryoko's case.</p><p><b></b>That his Ranma was always so forgiving and had a heart of gold surely helped and in this case it could and probably would lead to a lasting friendship or at least comradeship in the future. He had seen how Ryoko had reacted when Ranma had commented upon Kagato; the cyan-haired girl had been very relieved for she had apparently expected that they and especially Ranma, a fellow warrior would reject her because of her past.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi mused that those two might be good for each other; it was obvious that both his love and Ryoko had been through a lot so maybe they could help each other to overcome the gruelling experiences they had each respectively made in the past. The oldest Tendo sibling knew that there were some things in Ranma's past she did not want to talk about as of yet but maybe the influence of Ryoko could help and vice versa.</p><p><b></b>In his opinion it would be worth it; even if it would probably involve some kind of rivalry too. Though he mused that this could indeed be a healthy kind of rivalry which could and probably would drive both warriors to motivate each other to become better.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka smiled at Ranma. "Believe when I say that I know what you mean when you said she made you mad. She can be a real pest at times but I have to admit that she has redeemed herself."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko was very surprised at hearing this from her rival while every other member of the Masaki household nodded. Washu on her part was very relieved although she did not show it. Neither Ranma nor Kasumi seemed to see her daughter as a monster and that was a great relief. All the more reason to accept two such nice individuals as Ranma and Kasumi into their midst. She had however a question for the cursed individuals.</p><p><b></b>Before she could ask however Ranma suddenly remembered something. "One sec... did you say <i>700 years</i> ago or did I just hear wrong? <i>700</i> years? And I only <i>thought</i> I had heard Katsuhito wrong! I know that Cologne and Happosai are over 300 years old but Ryoko does not look older than 17! And you Katsuhito do not look older than 60! How is that possible?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko smirked. "I had the right diet!" she joked.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko looked as surprised as he began to grasp this. It was Washu who answered once more. "We all are much older than we look, Ranma. Except for Tenchi. You know that I am or was a Goddess; but what you don't know is that I locked my powers and memories away over 20,000 years ago. Yes," she said at their stares, "I am over 20,000 years old. Still looking good, eh?" she said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>Unsurprisingly Ranma and Kasumi-otoko presented warding signs and Washu waited until they had rejoined reality before she continued. "We wanted to break this gently to you but now that you found out it's time for the whole truth. I am over 20,000 years old and can take on the body of a 12 year old. This," a transformation and a very hot and adult looking Washu later, "is my adult form; I'll explain more about it tomorrow. Yosho or Katsuhito as he is known now is over 2,000 years old, Ayeka here over 700, Sasami too and Ryoko is over 5,000 years old. It is a complex and controversial topic that is connected with Juraian genes and the space trees but as it is a very intricate matter and it is already late we will leave it there for now."</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko slowly rewinded their jaws. "O...kay." both said still presenting warding signs. <i>This</i> was really a lot to take in.</p><p><b></b>When the two cursed individuals had calmed down somewhat again Washu asked the question she had wanted to ask. "Ranma, Kasumi," she began, and once she had the attention of both continued, "when do you plan to lock yourselves into your cursed forms?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Kasumi-otoko looked at each other. "We planned to do it first thing tomorrow. Kasumi and I both want to spend another night in our birthforms before we'll lock ourselves in our alternate forms for three months. Tomorrow it will take just a shower and the soap and we will both be locked for ten days. As we have three soap bars each they'll last for roughly a month. After that we will have to contact Cologne so she can send us our order."</p><p><b></b>Washu nodded as did the others. It was reasonable to start as soon as possible; the earlier they would get used to their curses the better. Although it seemed that thanks to each other they had already started to and made good way already. "Yet another question. How long have you been female already, Ranma? And how will you contact Cologne?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled sheepishly. Now she knew exactly what Washu was getting at, thanks to the talk. "I have been in female form for mostly two weeks now, on and off. So I will start my time in about two weeks, I suppose. Yes," she said at their looks, "I already got the 'talk'. My mother gave it to me after she learned that my useless pop had never told me what happens when boys 'n girls grow up. We also found out that the cycle stays the same regardless if we are in male or female form. Kasumi just had her monthlies and they came at the same time as they always do. As for Cologne, it would be really cool if you had a wlan-hotspot so that we could check our mail. We have her e-mail-address but we had no occasion to stop and check our mail as of yet."</p><p><b></b>Washu just wanted to respond but Ayeka's cry of outrage interrupted her. "What! Your father <i>never</i> told you what would happen? He never gave you the 'talk' but rather withheld such vital information from you? Even <i>after</i> you were cursed to become a girl? You could have started your time at any given time in China and what would have happened <i>then</i>? I can only speak for Jurai but on Jurai girls get the 'talk' early enough to take away any fear this sudden and important development could cause. I can only imagine the horror of a boy that is cursed to turn into a girl who then gets her first period! And knows nothing about it! <i>Where</i> does your father live again in Nerima?" she asked with an edge to her voice.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girl smiled. It was nice that the others cared for her. Outside from Kasumi and her mother she had not experienced much care in the past and it was a nice feeling. "No, he <i>never</i> told me anything; <i>especially</i> not after I turned into a girl. He <i>hated</i> it and I think I now begin to understand why. My cursed form reminds him of my mother as I have a very strong resemblance to her in my female form. And for some reason he is afraid of her. But if I <i>had</i> started in China I would probably have died! Of embarrassment and confusion. Only good that I never stayed a girl long enough to start. Now I am at least somewhat prepared. Horribly nervous but at least I know what to expect." she said in a tone that told the others that she doubted that she'd start at all. Then Ranma smirked. "And as for where the useless panda lives I'll gladly note down the address. Only promise me not to destroy anything. Also let him live so that he can be educated a bit further about just how weak women <i>really</i> are." she finished sarcastically.</p><p><b></b>Nobody had noticed Katsuhito flinch when Ranma had said that she had a strong resemblance to her mother for Katsuhito actually knew that to be true. But he could not say anything. Not yet. First Ranma had to settle down and get used to the curse or everything would be too much at once.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka and Ryoko smiled evilly and the present females nodded. Good! Ranma had at least had the 'talk'. That was a start. Meanwhile Kasumi-otoko looked at the members of the Masaki-household. "As one born a female I can assure you that it <i>is</i> the same on Earth. Normally girls are told by their mother or an aunt what to expect when they are about to start their first period. I say normally but that was also not the case with me. When my mother died and I started five years later I had to find out by myself. And as you will have guessed, Ranma's father was and is sorely lacking in a lot of categories. Sadly."</p><p><b></b>Now that was the understatement of the century. Genma Saotome and only sorely lacking? The man was more like a complete and utter failure in apparently everything beside martial arts. And even there he'd more than royally screwed up! Mihoshi for her part beamed at Ranma. "Oh, it will be so much fun, Ranma-chan! Tomorrow we will go shopping for you! You'll need tons and tons of new stuff!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Said Ranma face-faulted once more. Oh great, a shopping trip. Just what she needed. With a sigh she plopped back into the pillows of the couch. The Kami apparently really got a kick out of making her life difficult…</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
