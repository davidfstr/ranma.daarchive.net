</div><p><b>Title</b>: A trip to self</p><p><b>Author name</b>: Trugeta</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by Rumiko Takahashi and VIZ as well as Kajishima Masaki and many others. No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 23: Under attack</b></p><p><b></b>Shaking her head to clear it Ranma surveyed the situation. One Ryoko was fully involved in the battle against the second Ryoko. Thanking her mentors (not for the first time) for her Ki-senses, Ranma watched intently. Due to the senses she could easily determine which Ryoko was false and which not. The others, meaning Tenchi and Ayeka were not as lucky and were standing around uselessly, unsure of who to attack.</p><p><b></b>It had <i>not</i> helped that each time when one Ryoko had claimed to be the real one the other had claimed the same thing in the same way; indeed they had been living together for quite some time but neither Tenchi nor Ayeka had been able to discern who the real Ryoko was. They had been informed of the nature of the attacker by Washu but whichever the fake was it had been prepared very well. Tenchi on his part believed that Washu knew more than she'd told them but he'd find out after the battle; a battle he could not join at the moment for aforementioned reasons. It was frustrating.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part didn't know much about the first Android incident that had happened some time ago and thus she didn't know much about Zero and what had happened back then. All that they'd been told was that the Masaki's had been infiltrated by an Android called Zero; and that Ryoko and Zero had become one after it had rebelled against its master.</p><p><b></b>But unlike Zero this Android here that had also taken on the appearance of Ryoko was obviously programmed to kill them all. It had been a wise precaution on Washu's part to upgrade the sensor-net after the 'Zero-incident' for fear something like that could be tried again, that Ranma had to admit. It was however very convenient that she was here for had she not the others might have had a harder time to find out which of the Ryoko's was the attacker; but whoever had sent the Android had obviously not had her on the equation.</p><p><b></b>Katsuhito would have been able to differ between the Ryokos' too, Ranma mused but he was not here at present as he was protecting the house, but especially Sasami and Mihoshi. And if she'd gauged the situation correctly he would have been the first target of the Android after the destruction of the sensor-net; for if Katsuhito had been out of the way no one would have been able to tell the two apart which would have given the Android the chance to strike from the shadows.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi was just not good enough to differentiate between the Android and the real Ryoko as of yet; but Ranma had to admit that whoever had built the Android was very good, a downright genius. Even she had been hard pressed to recognise the fake and <i>her</i> senses had gotten a lot better.</p><p><b></b>After the sensor-net and Katsuhito it could have taken Ryoko out and assumed her place in order to kill the others much more easily; the only thing necessary would have been to leave no body of the real Ryoko behind then it could have claimed that it had killed the attacker. In the chaos following the deaths of Katsuhito and Ryoko it would have been easy.</p><p><b></b>Ranma did not know if that was what the Android had in mind but in her book it was a safe bet. Infiltrate, mimic and strike. Ranma mused that in case that this modus operandi failed the Android had something up its sleeve to deal with a household of super-powered aliens. From watching Ryoko and the Android going toe to toe she knew what.</p><p><b></b>Boy could that thing fight! It was not so much the technique behind the moves that impressed Ranma but the sheer power and speed. That their opponent was a machine also meant that she would not have to hold back against it. Storming forward with adrenaline pumping through her veins she entered the battle. "Tenchi, this one is a fake!" she exclaimed and pointed to the Ryoko on the right.</p><p><b></b>Her childhood friend nodded and together they attacked the Android while Ayeka stood back as backup. Tenchi was very glad that Ranma could tell the fake apart from the real one as this ended his forced inactivity. The real Ryoko was glad too that she was finally getting some very much needed support here; for whatever Dr. Clay had done when he had created the new Android; the beast was darn strong and tough! She doubted that she'd be able to take it down on her own and a repetition of what had happened with Zero was unlikely seeing as things were going at present.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had joined the battle and used all of her speed to land blows all over the Androids body but the machine just shrugged them off. Even Tenchi who was using his Lighthawk sword and armour was not faring much better. Ranma's blows were too fast for the Android to dodge but the sword-strikes it dodged easily.</p><p><b></b>It was just like Ryoko had said in their fight: what you can't hit you can't defeat. It also seemed as if the Android had something to counter the powers of the Lighthawk for Tenchi's attacks had little to no effect. Suddenly the Android lashed out and landed an upper-cut on Tenchi. Due to his Lighthawk sword he had obviously been perceived as the highest immediate threat. The black-haired boy landed dazed several dozen feet away and Ranma saw that Ayeka was already looking after her fiancé.</p><p><b></b>As Ranma watched Tenchi go down she had to remember Katsuhito's words from a minute ago. She had sensed that Tenchi had flared that strange ki of his but it seemed as if Washu's intel had been correct; the machine had something up its sleeve to counter his powers and had somehow downed Tenchi with ease despite his powers.</p><p><b></b>Well, that left her and Ryoko to deal with the Android for the moment. Damn, it did not look good for them at the moment thought Ranma as she stopped the machine from going after Tenchi. Instantly she used her chestnut-fist and landed nearly 1,000 blows in under a second but the damn thing did not seem to feel anything! What was that thing made of? Adamantium?</p><p><b></b>Ryoko who had regrouped and was working on the backside of the Android was not faring much better. Despite her increased strength she seemed to be no match for this new Android and slowly she was getting frustrated. She growled, pulled back her right fist and used all of her strength to connect in one hard punch. The blow seemed to shake the frame of the Android but despite that it had not much effect.</p><p><b></b>Slowly and seemingly with a smirk the Android turned around to the real Ryoko and Ranma used this momentary lack of concentration on her to connect a hard upper-cut to the Androids chin. Despite her training in the Breaking Point she had to resist the urge to grab her hand. Damn, that thing was hard!</p><p><b></b>Ranma and Ryoko looked at each other and nodded. Now that the Android was several feet away from them and the others they could safely use their energy attacks. Moments later they did just that. Ryoko let lose a hailstorm of energy-blasts while Ranma launched flaming orb after flaming orb. Soon a huge dust-cloud was raised and the two warriors could not see or feel their foe any more; though both were certain that they had done some damage. They should be proven wrong soon.</p><p><b></b>Sudden movement within the cloud was their only warning before Ryoko was tossed aside like a rag-doll; then the Android was upon Ranma. It had deemed the redhead the new high risk to her mission due to her apparent ability to sense that she was not the original Ryoko.</p><p><b></b>Without its mimicry it was missing a vital advantage for its creator, Dr. Clay had programmed it with the behavioural patterns of Ryoko Habiki. It had been tested thousands of times and could play a very convincing Ryoko. Had not the security sensors which had apparently been upgraded alerted them of its presence before it had disabled them it might have been able to kill and replace the real Ryoko after it would have killed Yosho; which would have made its mission much easier.</p><p><b></b>After all, who'd suspect someone you trusted to be a killer? If anything would have gone as planned the arch-enemy of its master, Washu, would have had to watch how something that looked like her daughter killed everyone she loved or at least cared for. Its intel had however not included any data about that strange disturbance, the redheaded woman. Thanks to her it'd have to do it the old fashioned way. Beat on them until they dropped dead.</p><p><b></b>First it'd terminate this irritating redhead that could tell it apart from the real Ryoko. Its design was superior for it'd been devised to be the ultimate and unstoppable Android. It would be the end of the foes of its master; it'd be his ultimate revenge. And now that it had been uncovered it would not use its vocal cords so as to confuse and scare the organic life-forms further. It would attack mercilessly and mute which would soon erode any resistance its targets would offer.</p><p><b></b>Speaking and claiming that it was the real Ryoko was illogical until it had eliminated the redhead. Which it would do now. After that was done it would return to the original plan and kill Yosho and afterwards Ryoko. Then it would either pretend to be the real Ryoko or kill them all right off. Whatever suited the situation best.</p><p><b></b>The Android shot forward and Ranma did a backflip to evade a kick aimed for her right side, raced forward at the machine and fired an energy blast. But the Android simply jumped out of the way and raced forward on its own. It sent a hail of punches at Ranma which were driving her constantly back. The redhead reached deeper into her power reserves, deep into that intermixing well of power that she could still not access fully and at will as of yet and her defence improved instantly.</p><p><b></b>She was now able to keep the machine from wiping the floor with her and upped the ante. With a sudden burst of speed Ranma launched a series of punches and kicks at the Android and was able to hit it hard in the face with a blow that slipped through its defences. The air actually trembled from the impact but the Android stood unfazed. Ranma was completely surprised that her punch had had no effect at all and that cost her. The Android gave her no chance to recover but grabbed her wrist and pulled her towards it, meeting Ranma's ribs with its right knee.</p><p><b></b>The redhead grunted but did not admit the pain and then she grabbed the hand the machine was using to hold her; throwing it over her shoulder in one fluid motion. The surprised machine had no time to react as the Saotome girl fell on it in a frenzy of kicks and punches. Wisely the others stayed out of the fight at the moment as they saw just how tough and strong that damn machine was. No one aside from Ranma was apparently a match for it in regards of speed, not even Tenchi with his Light hawk abilities.</p><p><b></b>Furthermore in close combat like this they might endanger Ranma more than be of use to her. As it seemed none of them had a chance in close combat aside from Ranma it would be illogical to join the battle at that point. Especially Ryoko was frustrated to no end to be so helpless but she was just no match for the machine in regards of speed. Grudgingly she had to admit that she'd also be hard pressed to match the toughness and strength of that thing.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi shook his head and grumbled as he observed the fight. The machine Dr. Clay had designed there was simply too fast for him to hit and the recovering youth swore and oath that the first thing he'd work on after this bout here was over was his speed. Like it had been said before, what good did power if one could not apply it to hit the target?</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile the fight between Ranma and the impostor raged on. The Android managed to connect a blow to Ranma's face that sent her flying backwards but the redhead recovered quicker than the wind and used her Amaguriken-speed to cover the distance that separated her from the Android.</p><p><b></b>Immediately the Saotome girl was on the offence and showed all her prowess as she executed a fluid and fast punch-kick-roundhouse-kick-blast-combo but it was of no use; not one of her blows managed to penetrate the defences of the Android.</p><p><b></b>The machine matched her blow for blow and as it was not made of organic material it did neither tire nor lessen in the intensity of its attacks. The same could not be said about Ranma who slowly began to tire under the strain.</p><p><b></b>Digging deeper into her bag of tricks Ranma employed the technique of the 'splitting cat heirs' to split herself into numerous images of herself; she had been taught in the secrets of this technique by Elder Cologne and deemed it quite useful to confuse an opponent if one needed to catch ones breath. And as much as she loathed admitting it she <i>did</i> have to catch her breath for a moment.</p><p><b></b>Her diversion also seemed to work as the machine <i>was</i> confused for a few precious moments; this time was all Ranma needed to catch her breath. She had guessed that the Android would adapt fast but her trick had brought her into the position to launch the next offence.</p><p><b></b>Seeing that the machine was focussed on her, that meant that it had by now seen through her deception, she was now ready; and before the machine could attack she made the first move. It was time to use her bag of tricks. "PHOENIX BURST!" she exclaimed and suddenly a bright glow emanated from the palm of her hand. As she herself knew the effects of her divertive strategy she had shielded her eyes; the Phoenix Burst would hopefully hit the Android unprepared and would overload its visual receptors with a bit of luck.</p><p><b></b>Not waiting to verify if her diversion had worked she launched herself at the Android and tried to make as much structural damage as possible; she mainly concentrated on the head as she suspected it to hold the core of the AI. Several hundred punches in very rapid succession snapped the head of the Android back but to Ranma's chagrin she just wasn't making enough damage.</p><p><b></b>She also noticed that the Android was recovering as it fixed its eyes on her and she just jumped back in time to escape being enveloped in a surely crushing hug. As strong as she was she was sure that she would not survive a bear hug from this mechanical monster. Damn! It seemed as if hand-to-hand would just not do to make damage to that machine. No the battle was not going well, that she had to admit.</p><p><b></b>The watchers, foremost the strategists Tenchi and Ayeka were sharing this opinion. Despite Ranma's huge ki-reserves it slowly became obvious that the Android was gaining the upper hand. She was doing well in holding her own up till now but she just did not seem to be able to do enough damage. In contrast to the Android she would also tire over time. Not good. <b>'Damn!'</b> Tenchi thought. <b>'If only I could use my powers sufficiently against that thing I could help Ranma-chan! But whatever it is that Dr. Clay built into that Android blocks my powers! And Ryoko can't do anything either because she's too slow! Sorry old chap but you're on your own. I hope little Washu finds a way to unblock my powers so I can slice that thing in two!'</b></p><p><b></b>Similar thoughts were running through Ryoko's head; she just itched to enter the fight but she knew that this was not a pub-brawl which could be won through strength, endurance and toughness. Those were factors here too but she just did not have the speed to keep up with that thing. Damn how she hated the feeling of helplessness!</p><p><b></b>One look at Ayeka told her that the fellow warrior maiden felt the same thing; granted, Ayeka was probably better in hand-to-hand in comparison to her but to enter in close combat with that Android would have been suicide for Ayeka. Her energy blasts were out of the question too for obvious reasons. That left Ranma as the only one able to keep up with the Android due to her obvious prowess in martial arts.</p><p><b></b>Said redhead on her part was growing frustrated too. Rapidly. As of now she was unable to use her new powers consciously to do more than add it to her ki-blasts; in fact despite that her power-centre was somehow changing and intermixing she was still using her ki a lot more and without the aid of her new powers, that she knew, she had no chance to win this fight. The little she could use of her new powers was simply not enough.</p><p><b></b>At the moment she could still hold her own but she was tiring. The others could not help her as they were too slow to stand a chance against the mechanical monster. That left her only one choice; the Kanemoku-ha wave was out of the question, as it took her too long to gather the necessary energy. Okay, time to show of another move. "PHOENIX FIRE!" she suddenly exclaimed firing one of her newest energy attacks she could do thanks to her new powers and due to what she'd watched Prince(ss) Herb do in their fight.</p><p><b></b>Instantly a huge spiral beam made of intertwined orange and red flames shot towards the Android and hit it dead-centre on the chest where it exploded with a huge bang. Debris was flying everywhere but before the dust cloud could even settle down Ranma saw movement within it. <b>'Damn, what does it take to destroy that damn thing?'</b> she thought slightly panting. It really seemed that nothing could stop that thing…</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>And really, mere moments later a nearly unharmed Android resumed the fight. Soon the human and the machine were trading blows once more while the others could only watch. Ranma shot a roundhouse kick to the machines' head that found only air and moved her right hand just in time to block a punch to the abdomen; then her left hand barely stopped a knee from breaking her nose.</p><p><b></b>Ranma then executed a chop-claw-kick combo but it was as ineffective before Android's air-tight defence. She knew that she'd probably be defeated if she continued to use hand-to-hand but she hoped to buy enough time so that something could be done to unblock Tenchi's powers. She only had to carry on…</p><p><b></b>And that she did. In follow-up Ranma executed a flawless chop-kick-punch-combo which looked really fluid and nice but was blocked by the Android with ease. The machine then started to execute an attack of its own and raised the tempo of the match for it phased out of sight and reappeared above Ranma, trying to hammer her down into the ground. But the Saotome girl had her guard-up and blocked the blow with some trouble then somersaulted and kicked at the Androids left side.</p><p><b></b>The machine had no troubles in blocking the blow and took the offensive again. It decked its opponent with a flurry of punches which were all countered and returned by Ranma. The experienced young warrior then aimed a kick for the machine's forehead in a feint attack and it countered the blow unknowing that the real attack was to follow.</p><p><b></b>Faster than it could follow the machine was then punched hard in the face and flew back. With a lightning quick kick Ranma shot her opponent through an array of trees that had remained unharmed in her fight with Ryoko. However that had not been enough to stop the Android and the machine shook the destroyed trees off of it like a human would dust himself off of sawdust.</p><p><b></b>It was unnerving for Ranma that the machine remained mute for the whole time and taunting or insulting it to confuse it and bring it off track seemed unlikely methods to her. She would have to beat it the old fashioned way. By putting as much holes through vital spots until it ceased moving. Too bad that this darn thing was so tough!</p><p><b></b>Like a juggernaut the machine marched forwards and attacked once more. And as if on cue it increased the tempo even more and hit Ranmas' defences with Earth-shattering blows which the young girl was nearly unable to block.</p><p><b></b>The machine blocked each retaliation thrown at it with unnerving ease and actually managed to connect a few times. Sensing its opponent's weakness it leapt forward at the redhead and sent a hailstorm of punches at her which were driving the Saotome girl back, limiting her to defence only.</p><p><b></b>She heard Kasumi-otoko yell to her to be careful but she could do little to answer her love. She noticed by now that her energy reserves were depleting and that she would go down if that kept up but by Kami-sama, she would go down fighting! Apparently she was the only one that could and she'd die to protect the others if necessary. It was a martial artist's sworn duty to protect others and she'd live and die by this codex. <b>'For my love and my friends!'</b> she thought.</p><p><b></b>With a battlecry she launched herself at the machine again and decked it with a blurry of punches and kicks, followed by a roundhouse-kick-blast-combo. The machine blocked everything with an impassive expression and suddenly its right fist lashed out.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's face met it as she was too slow to block it and she was sent flying upwards. The Android cut back instantly, phased out of sight and bashed her into the ground again upon reappearance.</p><p><b></b>The redhead rocketed to the ground and came to her feet troublesome a few moments later. She gritted her teeth and summoned all of her power. So, the damn machine was stronger than her. But she was still faster! Tapping deep into her Amaguriken speed she managed to phase in behind the Android and launched more than 1,000 blows in under one second.</p><p><b></b>It was admittedly weaker blows than before and sadly they did little to no damage. Shrugging the blows off as if they were the stings of an insect the Android turned around in one fast and fluid motion and upper-cutted the redhead towards were Kasumi-otoko and the others were standing.</p><p><b></b>Somewhat dazed the Saotome girl got to her feet but she was too late to block the energy blast that headed her way; whatever that blast was it was damned fast. Too fast even for any of Ryoko, Ayeka or Tenchi to block it with their shields assuming the blast <i>could</i> be blocked. Time seemed to freeze and everyone looked on in horror, unable to move. Ranma just had time to cross the arms in front of her face and hoped she'd escape that bout somewhat burnt but alive. Though considering the power of the machine she prepared herself for the worst.</p><p><b></b>While Ranma had crossed the arms in front of her face another party had sprung into action. Before anyone could do anything suddenly a loud "Nooooooooo!" could be heard and from behind and beside her Ranma felt movement.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly someone was in front of her and shielded her from the blast and when it hit she realised to her horror who it was that had saved her. It was… Kasumi-otoko! All of a sudden time seemed to stop completely as the redhead looked down disbelieving at her bleeding and charred love.</p><p><b></b>Blood was flowing from his mouth and ears and he was thankfully unconscious; though he was obviously in a very bad state. Blood was also flowing from various wounds and already started to stain his shirt and pants. Ranma had no idea how badly injured he was or if he was still alive at all but it looked very bad. Slowly her disbelief changed to shock. Tears started welling up in her eyes and she made no move to stem them.</p><p><b></b>Ranma barely noticed how a growling Ryoko ignited her energy blade and moved in to attack the Android. Her attacks did not do much damage but they kept the machine busy at least. Busy enough to allow Ranma to check on her saviour.</p><p><b></b>Slowly Ranma sunk down to one knee and felt for a pulse. There was none! The Saotome girl shook her head; that couldn't be true! It had to be a nightmare. She checked again. Still no pulse! She slowly closed her eyes. That <i>had</i> to be a bad nightmare. She'd close her eyes and everything would be back to normal when she'd open her eyes again.</p><p><b></b>Yet the scene stayed the same after she reopened her eyes. Kasumi-otoko was still looking dead and there was blood… so much blood! She barely noticed how Tenchi and Ayeka had both knelt down to either side of Kasumi-otoko and were trying to stem the blood-flow. Then, suddenly a shriek of anguish ripped through the silence. "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Damn it, I <i>love</i> you! You can't leave me! You hear me? You can't! I love you…" she sobbed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma just had no way of saving her love as she didn't know how to do CPR. For all intents and purposes her love had died for her and any logical thought was swept away; she even forgot that there were others around her who might be able to save Kasumi-otoko. All that kept going on in her mind was the mantra <b>'It is my fault… it is my fault…'</b> until she caught sight of the Android that was currently busy fighting Ryoko. No, it was not her fault, it was its fault! And it would pay a thousand fold!</p><p><b></b>Hate-filled eyes locked on the Android and tuned out the rest of the world; Ranma did not notice how Ayeka and Tenchi were trying to revive her love with CPR and mouth-to-mouth nor did she notice how Ryoko was thrown fifty feet backwards by an upper-cut from the Android; all who could see Ranma's face at that moment would swear later that no demoness from the deepest pits of hell could have looked scarier.</p><p><b></b>Deliberately she stepped away from the body of her love and incidentally from Ayeka and Tenchi bringing some distance between them, the image of the bloody body of her love etched into her mind. Her hate and rage at the machine rose and with a sudden yell of anguish Ranma unleashed a huge fiery aura which even caused Tenchi and Ayeka to stop briefly in their attempts to revive Kasumi-otoko.</p><p><b></b>For the first time Ranma tapped fully into the well of power within her; a well of power that had finally combined from to power-sources into one huge well of power. Nothing was holding her back any more and every seal and lock was torn apart by a flow of rage thusly never seen before in the normally kind and caring Saotome youth. Hateful blazing eyes locked on the Android which was currently under siege by Ryoko's energy blasts while Ranma's power-up continued.</p><p><b></b>Washu, who was sitting in her lab, currently busy with finding a way to overcome the blockade Dr. Clays Android had somehow erected on Tenchi's and Yosho's powers registered Ranma's power-up on her emergency sensors as a huge shockwave; but due to the fact that the Android had destroyed her main sensor-array she could not get as much data as she would have liked. What she could say with certainty was that Ranma was putting out more power than she had seen in a long time. And that was saying something.</p><p><b></b>Her scanners also alerted her of the condition of one Kasumi-otoko Tendo. She only caught brain-activity from him but no breathing or pulse. And if they did not act fast he'd die! Not even <i>she</i> could bring back the dead but there was still hope as of yet. Using her mental link she shared with her daughter she initiated the necessary steps and redirected her attention fully to her new priority. <b>'Ryoko, stop what you're doing and grab Kasumi-otoko; teleport him directly to the medical wing of the lab. Pronto!'</b> she sent.</p><p><b></b>Mere moments later her apparently somewhat ruffled and very angry daughter thought back a confirmation and Washu used one of her doors to get to the medical wing of her lab. She dearly hoped that she could help Kasumi-otoko else this world might meet an untimely end…</p><p><b></b>On the battlefield Ryoko had done what her mother had ordered and only Tenchi, Ayeka and Ranma remained aside from the Android. Ranma still continued to power up and her pupils had changed from blue to red. Fire was dancing all over her body and her muscles seemed to have grown.</p><p><b></b>As had her body in general, as it seemed for Ranma stood now a few inches taller than before. The power-up process itself and Ayeka who had started to fire constant barrages of energy blasts at it had kept the Android from doing anything to interrupt the process; fact which would prove to be its undoing.</p><p><b></b>For suddenly and without warning Ranma was just a fiery streak that shot forward, leaving a trail of flames in her wake. She was practically shrouded in her power and actually created a sonic boom when she launched herself at the Android. The machine had no chance to react before a fiery fist impacted with its face. Unlike before this blow <i>did</i> damage, much to the consternation of the machine.</p><p><b></b>It tried to read the power-level of the mysteriously changed redhead but drew a blank. Odd. It just did not get a reading on its target. Suddenly it heard a hate filled voice from its left side. "For what you did to my love you will pay! I'll enjoy ripping ya apart, ya tin can!"</p><p><b></b>This was followed by a crushing kick to the right side of the Android; this blow did damage too and the Android had no idea why. Its design was superior! No human being should be able to harm it! Heck, not even her programmed targets should be able to harm it and <i>they</i> were classified as super-powered aliens. What <i>was</i> this strange being before it?</p><p><b></b>Ranma for her part did not care what she was as long as this mechanical monster that had dared to harm and kill her love was destroyed by her. Preferably with her bare hands. However, the Android had other plans and suddenly jumped up into the air, using its power of flight as an advantage over its opponent. As it floated several feet above Ranma's head it had a nearly gloating expression on its face.</p><p><b></b>But the machine had gloated too early as Ranma thwarted the machine; with fire burning in her eyes she jumped up into the air herself. Instinctively she copied what Ryoko had done in their fight and pushed her ki under herself because she felt the need to follow and destroy the machine. It wouldn't be safe from her and her fury, nowhere. She'd blow that thing into smithereens and if it was the last thing she did! Within some seconds she got her flight under control and her eyes burned with fire. "Thought ya could escape my wrath, eh, tin can? Think again!" she exclaimed with venom in her voice.</p><p><b></b>Never before had she felt so much hate for anyone or anything for she had always been caring and forgiving and had nearly never given in to any bad feelings. Yet this machine had taken away what she loved most and she had not even been able to tell her love that she loved him. It had killed her love and that could not be forgiven! Never!</p><p><b></b>Having her flight under control now she shot forward so fast so that it seemed as if she'd disappeared. Growling she then shot a hard roundhouse-kick to the machines head from above and this time the shot was a major hit. The Android was sent to the ground, but caught itself in time to prevent crashing into the ground. With a clicking sound it landed on its feet, ready to resume the battle.</p><p><b></b>However, Ranma had been to fast for it to follow and had already reappeared behind it. The machine sensed a slight tapping on its left shoulder and turned to look what the disturbance was. Seconds later its sensors registered the impact of a fists strength, it exceeded the scales of its sensors.</p><p><b></b>The machine staggered back from the force of the blow but caught itself fast enough to block another blow. Ranma snarled. Feeling that her hand-to-hand skills would do damage now she gave in to the burning rage she felt at what that thing had done. Nothing was holding her back and for the first time in her life she did not pull her punches since she had grown in power.</p><p><b></b>The Android was still regaining its balance when Ranma phased out of sight and uppercutted the machine hard on reappearance. Using her newly gained ability to fly in combination with her speed she phased in into the flight-path of the Android and hammered it straight into the ground with a double-fisted blow.</p><p><b></b>Not letting up the tiniest bit she flew towards the ground and landed a spin-kick into the abdominal area of the machine which had regained a standing position after extracting itself from the involuntary crater it had made. The force of the kick was enough to cause it to stagger back. Ranma pressed her advantage mercilessly and shot a strong roundhouse-kick to the Android's head, intent on doing severe damage.</p><p><b></b>However somehow the Android manage to block the blow and it seemed as if it was back in the race again. The machine instantly launched a series of punches at Ranma's head yet the redhead weaved around the blows like a dolphin in the sea. Seeing that its attacks were doing naught it tried to knee Ranma yet the redhead countered the blow with her own knee and a snarl.</p><p><b></b>Her anger and rage were fuelling her power and she laid all her hate for the blasted Android into a hard upper-cut that sent the Android flying in a wide arc. It landed in a heap nearly fifty feet away and Ranma did not give it the chance to recover this time. The time for being friendly was over. Now she was <i>really</i> pissed and fed up with that thing. Now it was time to get really deadly and even though she had sworn to never use these attacks the situation now warranted it. Running like the wind courtesy of her Amaguriken speed she covered the distance that separated her from the Android and stopped when she was ten feet away from the object of her hate.</p><p><b></b>Without much further ado Ranma gathered her impressive ki and launched one of her most deadly attacks at the Android. "Hiryo Shoten Ha revised: Flaming Inferno!" she yelled.</p><p><b></b>The tornado consisting of flames shot towards the machine with impressive speed and before the Android had any chance to react or initiate an evasive manoeuvre it was caught up in the flaming whirlwind. Ranma watched with satisfaction how the burning tornado tore at the Android and as this monstrosity was no living being she felt no remorse at using her attacks.</p><p><b></b>That vile beast had killed her love just like that and now the only thing left was revenge. Revenge for stolen moments, stolen chances, stolen kids and so much more. Tears filled her eyes as she thought about Kasumi-otoko and in the next moment hate filled her heart. Her ki surged upwards and the next moment another, even larger tornado followed the first. The Android which was already being tossed and turned around by the air-currents inside the tornado was subjected to even more structural stress as yet another flaming tornado tore into its side.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko who had teleported back onto the battlefield watched with her friends and loved ones how a look-alike of her was subjected to such treatment by a certain redhead; and Ranma was looking beyond pissed.</p><p><b></b>For a brief moment the cyan-haired alien shuddered at the thought that <i>she</i> might have angered the redhead enough to force her to do something like that to her. Ryoko did not know that Ranma had sworn to never use these attacks against living beings so she was rightfully impressed and quite a bit flustered.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi on his part had never seen the even-tempered and happy-go-lucky Ranma so angry. Ranma seemed to be a fury incarnate but then again, if the love of his life had been hurt and maybe killed how would he have reacted? Probably the same way Tenchi mused to himself.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma's plan if it could be called that seeing as her mind was still clouded in a red haze of hate and rage seemed to add up as the Android was indeed suffering from structural damage courtesy of the flaming tornados. Just as the first one dissipated the redhead readied yet another move, the Ice Tornado. But as she put especially much of her Soul of Ice into it she had a new name for it. "Hiryo Shoten Ha revised: Frost Hell!"</p><p><b></b>Just as the Android was about to fall down to the ground it was caught up again in yet another tornado. The freezing air-currents of the Frost Hell did just as much structural damage as the Flaming Infernos had done but Ranma wanted to vent her frustration and hate on the Android. It should know what it had done and for what it would be destroyed. However the tornados did not do as much damage as Ranma had hoped they would, which meant that the machine was somehow protected from rapidly changing temperatures. It seemed as if she'd have to finish it off by literally blasting it to bits.</p><p><b></b>Bringing her powers completely to the fore she engulfed her fists in flames. Normally she enjoyed fights and fought for the sake of the fight but this fight was different. With this fight and the destruction of the Android she'd take revenge upon a mechanical monster. Revenge, in her opinion, might be satisfying but was never enjoyable for it meant that you had already lost someone or something you enjoyed being with or having. But at the moment she did not care. She just wanted to rip the beast to shreds. Preferably into as much tiny bits as possible.</p><p><b></b>With a hateful battle-cry she leapt into the air and used her new ability to fly. She did not care about her gender, she did not care about her stupid father, she did not care about all the bad things that had happened in her life. All that she cared about was taking revenge upon an evil creature that had taken her love away before she had been able to admit her love to him.</p><p><b></b>For that she'd tear the darn machine apart, limb from limb. The tornado had dissipated by now and a damaged Android had been dumped onto the ground. Even with its considerable strength and toughness it had not been able to escape the attacks of its foe unharmed but as it came to its feet it was still sure of its victory. After all, its creators had made it to be the ultimate Android. It <i>could</i> not be stopped or defeated.</p><p><b></b>Ranma thought otherwise and she was about to prove it. Faster than the scanners of the Android were able to follow Ranma came in and moments later the Android was punched hard in the face and flew back. In that time span Ranma had landed over 1,000 blows and with a lightning quick kick she shot her opponent right into the mountainous area that surrounded the Masaki compound.</p><p><b></b>The Android crashed through a mountain-side and took more damage but was still functional enough to carry on. Ryoko watched in fascination as her look-alike climbed out of its crash site and resumed the fight. The remainder of the Masaki household watched as Ranma followed her last attack with another, much more powerful version of the Phoenix Fire she had fired at the Android before. But unlike before this hit actually did major damage and the Android lost its right arm in the process.</p><p><b></b>However, Dr. Clay had apparently anticipated something like that and had included billions of nanites within the body of the Android. These nanites repaired the inflicted damage in a flash; mere seconds later the arm had been restored. The Android flexed it experimentally, obviously pleased with the results.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part was getting angrier by the second. It seemed as if she had to atomise the blasted machine instead of taking it apart limb from limb and soon she'd do just that. But before it came to that she'd have some good old fun with that wretched machine. Even if it could not feel the pain it would ease her own pain to see it suffer. That it was just an unfeeling machine made it much easier for her conscience too.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko and the others had been deeply unsettled by this new regenerative ability the new Android had demonstrated but their worries went up in smoke when they saw the expression on Ranma's face. She did not seem to be unsettled in the least; rather the opposite.</p><p><b></b>With yet another yell she launched the next attack at the machine and once more the redhead was too fast to follow. She simply seemed to disappear and suddenly appeared behind the Android. A hard kick to its head turned the face of the mechanical beast around and oil or another substance leaked from its mouth.</p><p><b></b>Before it could offer any resistance the machine was blasted over the compound by yet another Phoenix Fire followed by some good old hand-to-hand. It was clear as crystal that Ranma was now the superior fighter and not even the regenerative abilities of the Android could help it against the punishment that was now dealt out to it.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was completely unrelenting and the few blows that connected with her did not even faze her. Finally Ranma decided that she had had enough of the accursed Android and uppercutted it into the air. Fire blazed in her eyes as she readied yet another ki-attack.</p><p><b></b>Unlike in her fight against Ryoko however she planned to use everything she got in it. Her power welled up inside of her and moments later a red glow began forming her hands. Time to go into overkill-mode. "KA… NE… MO… KU… HAA revised: Purging wave!" she yelled and a huge red energy beam that looked like a wall of fire blasted towards the Android that had halted its flight in midair.</p><p><b></b>It had however absolutely no chance to avoid or deflect the incoming energy wave. The revised Kanemokuha-wave was simply too fast and when the Ryoko look-alike tried to block it the machine found out that it got burned away just from touching the beam.</p><p><b></b>The nanites were not able to work against the damage done and slowly the machine was reduced to naught. When Ranma was sure that nothing was left she let the beam dissipate and exhausted she sank to her knees. Then she curled up to a tight ball and began to sob. At first she had tried to remain strong, had wanted to prevent the tears from falling but the immense grief and sadness had just been overwhelming. The pain of loss was just too much for Ranma to deal with and she sobbed even harder.</p><p><b></b>Slowly and with compassion four warriors approached the sobbing redhead; Katsuhito had watched everything and had joined his grandson, Ryoko and Ayeka after the danger had passed, after he had been sure that Sasami and Mihoshi did not need his protection any more.</p><p><b></b>Especially Ryoko and Ayeka knew how Ranma must be feeling right now for they had thought at one point in time that they had lost Tenchi too. In an act of sympathy Ryoko got down beside the crying girl and laid a hand on her shoulder in an effort to comfort a fellow warrior. "Hey Red, ya did it! Ya won!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma however continued sobbing and mumbled something that sounded like "But… he's… dead…" between sobs.</p><p><b></b>At this point she was not caring at all that it was unmanly to cry. Heck, she was not even a man at the moment, just a weak and worthless girl that had allowed that the love of her life had been killed. "I'm… nothing… but… a… stupid… weak… girl!" she exclaimed between sobs and curled up even tighter.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka, Tenchi and Katsuhito looked at her with sympathy and the old Shinto priest just wanted to talk some sense into the crying redhead when Ryoko acted. She drew the sobbing redhead towards her. "Hey Red, that's not true. You're a strong warrior who defeated an Android that <i>we</i> could not stop. You ain't weak and you ain't stupid. B'sides, he's <i>not</i> dead." she said and left the 'yet' unspoken…</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
