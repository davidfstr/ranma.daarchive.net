No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 14</b></p><p><b>Interlude: Nerima Part 2</b></p><p><b></b>Next day things had settled down somewhat. Akane had protested about the appointment with the shrink to some extent, but the Tendo Patriarch had been adamant about it. Thus Akane had had to go, and although the first and very lengthy appointment had not sat too well with Akane she slowly began to grasp that she really needed professional help. The first action of the doctor after evaluating her had been to give her some strong medicine to get her temper enough under control to allow a productive session.</p><p><b></b>At the end of the session Dr. Jagakawa had prescribed her some rather strong medication which would help to tame her temper while they were working to find the reasons for it, and now that she had realised due to the doctors help that she really <i>had</i> temper problems she had sworn to take the prescribed medicine and had already done so. The effects had been astounding and had proven to even her, how many problems she really had with her temper and what it had caused. It had ultimately led to her losing someone she loved, and it was hard to come to grips with the fact that Ranma was gone from her live as a future husband.</p><p><b></b>The others had been right, she really had taken Ranma for granted, and she had believed that regardless how angry she got at him that he'd always stay with her. But obviously she had been wrong, and it had all been her damn tempers fault. She didn't know why, but she was beginning to see clearer now. Maybe the admission why she had been so angry with Ranma had had some cathartic effect, who knew? All that she knew was that she had problems, and she would work hard to overcome them.</p><p><b></b>When she reflected about the things that had been said two days ago Akane was actually glad that she had not given in to her temper and had yelled at them to go to hell. Her surprise had been just too great for this, surprise at being betrayed like this by her father and her sister.</p><p><b></b>They had actually three-teamed on her, Nabiki, her father and Nodoka, and the truth in their statements had made her go numb. She had talked with her shrink about it, and he had advised her to talk with her family about how she felt about it. After she had been convinced that the doctor could be trusted she had told him everything about the morning fights and the pictures Nabiki had sold of her, and what was 'normal' in the Tendo household. She even had grudgingly admitted that she had malleted Ranma on a regular basis, and for a few minutes the doc had been at a loss for words. When she had then told him about Ranma's curse and how she felt about it the doc had even needed more time to gather his bearings.</p><p><b></b>When Dr. Jagakawa had then asked if she believed that her sister had sold these pictures to spite her she had instantly been tempted to yell "Hell yes!", but the doc had forestalled an immediate answer and had urged her to think about it. Which she had done. And after reflecting on why her sister had done what she had done she realised that Nabiki had done everything to keep them cared for.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi had always cared for their physical and emotional well-being, that had been obvious to anyone, but Nabiki had been the one to take care of their monetary needs, and that mostly in secret. Even if her methods had been questionable, she had managed to keep them off the streets; and Akane knew that she had actually saved enough money for their first year in college, and that for all three of them.</p><p><b></b>After realising that and admitting it to herself, she had had no chance but to answer honestly. This was a therapy, and she wanted to make this work, so no need to lie to oneself. That had been the docs' words, and boy had he been right.</p><p><b></b>The 'talk' with her father, Nabiki and Nodoka had served to bring some of her beliefs down, and had that not happened she was sure that she would have carried on as if everything that happened to her was Ranma's fault. But that she had lost her engagement to Ranma was hers and hers alone, and even if it was hard for her, she would apologise to Ranma and tell him why she had been so angry at him.</p><p><b></b>The others had of course been at fault too. Nabiki with her way of making money off of her and Ranma and actually enjoying it a wee bit too much was at fault despite her resolutions to make money, her own father, who had been too cowardly to put his foot down regarding the morning fights, and also Nodoka, who had acted as if it was perfectly normal for her son to have multiple fiancées.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka's first reaction to Ranma's fiancée problem had incensed her at that time, and it had also given her even more justification to view Ranma as a pervert. This view of Nodoka, that she realised now, had been a good deal of her foundation for her beliefs of Ranma. And she would have to talk to them about it once she really got her temper under control. With her temper somewhat out of the way she was slowly coming to the conclusion that she had made enough accusations in the past. Maybe civilised talk would be a much better option…</p><p><b></b>After the 'talk', which had rattled her quite much and also due to the first, lengthy therapy session she was finally beginning to realise that her own behaviour after Jusendo had driven Ranma away. Any chance at love they had had together was dead now, and she had blown it, not Nabiki, not Nodoka and not her father. It was a lot to take in, but after what had been said two days ago and due to her own realisations from the therapy session she had realised that.</p><p><b></b>The 'talk' with the others had brought home the point, and the therapy session had cemented it. The doc had hinted that a lot of situations had escalated because of her rash reaction to a situation, and slowly Akane grasped, that it had been her fault. Especially her losing the engagement. She was grasping this slowly, and in her heart she knew that she'd never be able to become Ranma's iinazuke again, and she'd have to live with it. Maybe it was now really time to grow up and to not blame everything on someone else any more, for what good had it done her? Had it solved her problems any? No, rather the opposite.</p><p><b></b>And while Akane was hanging to her own thoughts and walked in silence beside her older sister, said Nabiki Tendo was sorting through her thoughts. She had spent the rest of yesterdays school day, aside from paying attention in class, with planning how to breach what had happened to the public. She had then come to the realisation, that the direct and blunt approach would probably be the best course of action. Though Kuno-baby could pose a problem in that regard.</p><p><b></b>Should he have learned about the fact that Ranma had been withdrawn from school, and there was a good chance for that due to the itsy-bitsy fact that his dad was their loony principal, he would probably begin to sprout one of his speeches and make her efforts so much more difficult.</p><p><b></b>It was logical to assume that Kuno had already forgotten the performance Ranma had given when she had pretended to be her sister-turned-brothers wife. Probably he had already adjusted reality to how he viewed it, and she'd give good odds on the bet that he would sprout one of his speeches soon, maybe even today. But she'd deal with this when she had to cross this bridge. Hmm, if only Tatewaki would not be such a nut-job, he'd be quite passable…</p><p><b></b>Sighing, she thought about more comfortable topics, i.e. the fate of one Genma Saotome. Auntie had once again prepared breakfast, and one could only commend her on the superb job she had done once again, including another round of calming tea for Akane in addition to her medication. Now that auntie knew the real reason behind Akane's anger she treated her sis a lot better than after the end of the engagement, and it looked as if reconciliation between them was possible.</p><p><b></b>And it had been too funny to see how auntie had even gotten the Panda to work. Apparently he had neither forgotten the threat hanging over his head nor the treatment he had received yesterday, for he had not been so stupid as to say that housework was a females´ duty even once. Maybe it was also due to the bandages which still covered a large part of his body and made induced changes into a panda somewhat uncomfortable, even if Genma had actually enough intelligence to loosen the bandages somewhat in case he did change…</p><p><b></b>Nodoka had refused to talk to her husband at all and had even gone so far as to ignore his presence completely. This had gone so far that the Saotome matriarch had not prepared breakfast for her husband, and all pleading and begging on his part had not worked.</p><p><b></b>Even the crouch of the wild tiger had failed, and Nabiki had admired Aunties determination to make her husband suffer. All this had ultimately led to the following: Genma had had to prepare his own breakfast, and as he was so inexperienced at it, it was a small miracle that he had not burned the kitchen down.</p><p><b></b>In the end it had been a supreme effort on his part to make himself some rice and coffee, the only things he was actually able to make just by himself, Nabiki mused. She knew that the fat man had really had no interest to cook a traditional meal for himself, as far too much work was involved in it for his taste, she was sure.</p><p><b></b>In his opinion cooking was for women, well, except for the time when Ranma had cooked for them on the trip, as he had admitted himself. And his comment about how he had been justified as his son had turned out a half-girl had not only sat not so well with Ranma. It was clear that the baka panda regarded cooking for oneself as unmanly and as a woman's duty. Nabiki actually wondered if she should set him on a bamboo diet to lessen the stress levels of auntie…</p><p><b></b>Nabiki shook her head. In all honesty, Genma was not even able to prepare a simple soup for himself, let alone a full traditional meal. And from his pleading and begging it had been pretty obvious that he had had no interest in using the camping gear in his pack and repeat what he had done during the time Kasumi had been sick: cook for himself. This was also why he had married Nodoka in the first place, Nabiki guessed, because she could cook, and that very good. And that she was beautiful surely did probably help too.</p><p><b></b>Well, in Nabiki's opinion no one aside from Genma would have called what he had prepared coffee and rice, but that on a side note. When Nodoka had finally spoken to him she had asked him in a frosty voice "And how did you survive the training trip with <i>your</i> skills at cooking?"</p><p><b></b>Chagrined, Genma had had to admit that that had been the reason why he had stolen food or made engagements for food so often and why Ranma had had to cook for them. Of course, this admission in addition to a certain comment about their child had served to incense Nodoka once more, and that Genma had apparently forced her child into taking up duties for which he had been much too young at the time led to the next 'dojo-session'.</p><p><b></b>And as the fat tub of lard deserved a lot more pain and suffering in Nabiki's opinion, she had smirked when Nodoka had led him into the dojo by the ear once more. Before the middle Tendo daughter had always played down in her own mind what had happened to Ranma on his training trip, but that Genma did not accept any of what they did to help Ranma, and that now, when he finally began to accept the curse, incensed her. If Genma hated women so much, then why in Kami-samas name had he married one? It couldn't be just because of her ability to cook great meals, could it? That would be downright pathetic. But very Genma, Nabiki concluded.</p><p><b></b>The man made no sense to her. On the one hand he had deliberately raised Ranma into an arrogant, ignorant macho jock who knew nothing about a woman and her wishes, but on the other hand he had expected him to hit it off instantly with one of them.</p><p><b></b>Was it only she who noticed the discrepancy between the concepts? How should someone who had been raised to view women as inferior and useless appreciate his own wife with convictions like that? It was a real miracle that Ranma had turned out as well as he had, what with Genma as a role-model and teacher! And he had made everything so much more worse for Ranma after he had been cursed to become a girl, for how should someone, who seemingly hated women, help his child accept the fact that it was now cursed to become what it had been taught to despise?</p><p><b></b>No, Genma and his teachings made no sense to her, and Nabiki was glad that his influence on Ranma and their household was removed bit by bit by auntie. That's why the trip made so much sense. If Ranma could accept his girl-half as a part of him, as <i>Ranma</i>, then her sister, or brother, depending on the weather, Nabiki mused amused, would be able to have a happy life together.</p><p><b></b>And should he ever become Kasumi's father-in-law she'd make sure that her sibling would be protected from him. To that end she was at present undertaking steps to ensure that Genma would never be able to attain control over the dojo. Sure, he was not the head of Clan Saotome any more and could thus not make decisions for Ranma any longer, but Nabiki mused that a man like him had still the one or the other ace up his sleeves.</p><p><b></b>Genma had always been a lazy man in her opinion, and normally lazy people were not dangerous per se. But in his case his laziness was coupled with a bottomless greed, and that he had raised Ranma the way he had was no coincidence in her opinion. She was convinced that Genma had kept Ranma deliberately ignorant of a lot of life's facts so that he would have an easier time to control Ranma and thus live off of his sons' efforts.</p><p><b></b>The plan was simple and ingenious. Take a child away from its mother, raise it, make it totally dependent from you in the process and keep it ignorant of everything 'unimportant', marry it off to the child of an old friend and take control over everything once they are married. But Genma had made the equation without taking her into consideration.</p><p><b></b>She would make sure that Kasumi would be far over 20 years old before she'd marry, and that both Ranma and Kasumi would hopefully have graduated from college by then would make it next to impossible for both fathers to intervene with Kasumi's and Ranma's lives.</p><p><b></b>That left her dealing with the situation at present. Not that she did not trust her father, and she was happy about the fact that he had grown a backbone, but she feared that he could still be influenced by Genma. And from now on Genma's influence on this family had to be minimised, and that included also Ranma, as far as she was concerned.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki had seen how Kasumi had looked at Ranma, and she was sure that they would act upon their feelings any time soon in the future. She was happy for her older sister, but also sad over her own stupidity at the same time. She had had Ranma on the hook for a brief time, and she had not realised just what a good catch he had been. Kasumi had, as she had looked underneath the rough surface, and her persistence had paid off in the end. Her big sis had caught an unpolished raw diamond, and she, who had always cared for them, deserved it the most.</p><p><b></b>It had helped that she had received the curse of the Drowned Man which gave her much more common ground with Ranma than any of them had ever had, and inwardly Nabiki wondered if the two would view the ability to become the opposite gender still as a curse when they came back from their trip. She herself could see a lot of practical uses for being able to change genders as a couple…</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter only hoped that she'd find as much luck as Kasumi apparently had found with Ranma. To herself she smiled at the irony. Her older sister, who had claimed that younger men were so boring had now ended up with exactly that, a younger man. Or was it a younger woman? Well, it all depended on the weather, among other factors, didn't it?</p><p><b></b>Heh, who would have thought that the arrival of one Ranma Saotome would lead to such interesting developments? She herself had really made a killing money-wise ever since Ranma had come into her life, and the fact that Ranma had actually <i>allowed</i> her to make this money had raised her opinion of the martial artist several notches.</p><p><b></b>And sometimes, especially lately, she felt bad over the fact that she had enjoyed doing the things she had done to Ranma. The things she had forced him, but especially her through from time to time would have been enough to make lesser persons run off crying. Now that she knew how Ranma really was she regretted what she had done in the name of making money. She had been too far gone in her conviction that the end justified the means, but had it been right to enjoy making money this was so much?</p><p><b></b>The depressing answer, at least for her, was no, and she finally understood what Kasumi had wanted to tell her. Money was not everything, but it could corrupt the character absolutely due to the greed that the hunt for money elicited. That she had seen proven especially in Genma Saotome. The man only lived for his basic needs and urges, and what were the consequences? He had damaged the Saotome family honour and the life of Ranma nearly beyond repair. No, she did not want to become like this, never! And once she would see Ranma again she would apologise to him, her, whatever, and hopefully Ranma would be able to forgive her.</p><p><b></b>Due to her realisations, that she knew, she no longer was the Ice-queen of Furinkan High. She did not know as of yet who she was or who she would be, but that cold-hearted mercenary persona she had been was gone. And in a few months she'd be off to college, where she'd have a fresh start. Only one more day of wearing this mask, and once this day was over, she'd have to do a thorough soul-searching.</p><p><b></b>And she'd also apologise to her baby sis for what she'd also done to her. She, like her sister apparently too, had realised a lot about herself recently. As for Akane, maybe now, finally, after she had admitted at least to herself that she had temper problems she would be on the way to recovery. Just like she…</p><p><b></b>Inwardly Nabiki knew that all the problems had been caused because the whole Tendo family had lived on as if nothing had happened after mother's death. And that had been one big mistake, a mistake, which still haunted them to the present day. But Akane was receiving help now, Kasumi had broken out of her shell, even if only due to the curse, and finally Kasumi had found someone she loved and who loved her. And she herself had realised that money was not everything.</p><p><b></b>At present Nabiki was on her way to school, reflecting in silence on the past and in the company of a very silent and withdrawn Akane. But upon arriving at the school gates Nabiki was raised out of her musing rather abruptly as her danger sense screamed. She could already see that a large group of students had gathered around one figure. The middle Tendo daughter smacked her head and muttered a curse. That figured. And once more a perfect example for Murphy's Law: what can go wrong will go wrong. Sigh. It seemed as if she'd have to cross the bridge now.</p><p><b></b>..."and finally the mighty Blue Thunder of Furinkan High has proven to be the righteous victor over the vile demon Saotome! My glorious presence has finally driven away the foul beast, and now the beauteous Akane Tendo and the pigtailed girl may date... urgh!" he suddenly exclaimed and dropped like a sack of potatoes.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki looked to her right side, where Akane had been a few seconds ago and where she still was. No, Akane had not laid a finger upon the delusional Kendoist and was looking quite surprised. Odd.</p><p><b></b>Upon seeing that no one was moving a finger to help Kuno Nabiki decided to intervene. He was tough, and it was not normal that Kuno dropped like that. Usually he would not go down without a severe beating. But as far as she had seen, no one had touched him. And it was highly unlikely that her baby sister had suddenly learned how to beat someone up without touching them. Or so she hoped.</p><p><b></b>She needed to elbow some people out of the way to reach the Kendoist, but most of them made way for her as soon as they saw the Ice-queen of Furinkan High approaching them. Finally Nabiki had reached Kuno, and what she saw disturbed her deeply.</p><p><b></b>For instead of its normal, healthy colour his face had taken on a sick, greyish colour. The colour of his lips worried Nabiki too. She instantly knew that something was very wrong and wasted no time. Nabiki pulled out her cell-phone and called an ambulance.</p><p><b></b>While they were waiting for the ambulance Nabiki shook her head. No, the day was not starting out as she had expected and planned. Not by a long shot. One glance at her sister, who was standing beside her confirmed that she was at a loss too. As were the people around them. What could have happened to Kuno?</p><p><b></b>As the waiting continued the first students began to ask questions.</p><p><b></b>"What has happened to him?"</p><p><b></b>"What did he say about Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>"Where <i>is</i> Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>"Did he defeat Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki sighed. The Furinkan rumour mill was already in full swing, and damage control was now next to impossible. And Ukyo, who was standing nearby, was watching her and her sister intently. Perfect. She felt like smacking her head. Odd, she felt this way a lot lately, and it was not even Ranma's fault.</p><p><b></b>She just wanted to begin with an explanation and had just taken in a deep breath when finally the ambulance arrived. Two paramedics and one doctor exited the vehicle, and the doctor took in the situation at once. "Over here!" he called to his two helpers, who followed him with a stretcher. Then the doctor noticed Nabiki, who was standing next to the unconscious Kuno. "Miss, can you tell me what happened here?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nodded. "I have no information as to what happened to him, but he suddenly just collapsed. Without further warning."</p><p><b></b>"Yes," one of her fellow students, a girl, exclaimed, "he was just making one of his usual speeches when he fell over. Without anyone touching him."</p><p><b></b>The doctor nodded and began to examine Kuno. He checked the heartbeat and the pulse-rate of his patient, then he began to examine the Kendoist more thoroughly. Well, as far as this was possible with the equipment the ambulance offered. After several minutes he looked up. "I can't be sure," he said to Nabiki, who he recognised as the leader of the group, "but I suspect that he has been poisoned. His vital signs and the greyish colour plus the colour of his lips indicate this. We'll have to take him to the hospital immediately. Do you know his parents or anyone else we could contact?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nodded. "Leave it to me. His father is the principal here, so no sweat."</p><p><b></b>The doctor nodded again. "Thanks, Miss. We have to leave now so that my patient can receive help as fast as possible. I have already given an antidote, but the lab has to find out which poison was used so that it can be neutralised efficiently." he said.</p><p><b></b>And with that the two paramedics lifted Kuno onto the stretcher and carried him to the ambulance, which then, as soon as the patient was onboard, sped away with its blaring horn.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter sighed. Ranma was now gone from Nerima, but it seemed that they still lived in interesting times even without the cursed martial artist. Her mood did not improve when she saw Ukyo Kuonji approach them. "Ukyo." she greeted neutrally.</p><p><b></b>"Nabiki." was the equally neutral greeting. "I'd like to know where my Ran-chan is. He has kept his distance from me for far too long, and now that I wanted to change this he was not in school yesterday and he is not with you two today. <i>And</i> the Nekohanten is closed. Something is fishy here. Where is he, and how much will it cost me?"</p><p><b></b>The mercenary girl suppressed the mother of all sighs with great difficulty. It seemed as if she had to show her cards earlier than anticipated. With her emotionless mask in place she replied, "I'll come to that. One moment. Listen everyone!" she said and whistled, which brought her the immediate attention of all students. "Anyone who wants to know what has happened to Ranma Saotome, meet me here during break. I will tell you for a fee of 5,000 Yen each. Till then."</p><p><b></b>Just at this moment the bell rang, and the students made their way into the building, muttering among themselves about the recent events. Ukyo was walking with Nabiki and Akane, her battle-spatula strapped to her back as usual. "So, something <i>has</i> happened with my Ran-chan. And I bet it has to do with <i>you</i>!" she exclaimed, pointing her index finger at Akane, who stared back at Ukyo angrily but said nothing. "What has happened, Nabiki? What has she," she pointed at Akane with an angry and jealous expression, "done now?"</p><p><b></b>The ice-queen only shook her head. "You'll have to wait like the others, Kuonji." she said and proceeded to walk to her class, while Ukyo silently steamed. She hated that she could do nothing against Nabiki, for her blows were not of a physical nature but hurt so much more. Nabiki had the power to ruin one's life. And hers was already ruined enough as that she could have risked to ruin it even more.</p><p><b></b>Thus she turned to a more fitting target, one who conveniently went to the same class as her. "What have you done to my Ran-chan, Tendo?"</p><p><b></b>Akane's temper began to rise, but her medication kept it nearly completely under wraps, so that it was nothing more than a shadow of what it used to be. "He is not <i>your</i> Ran-chan, and he never was and never will be. And now leave me the hell alone!" she said and nearly seemed to be ready to erupt in tears as she stormed away.</p><p><b></b>That stunned Ukyo somewhat and took a good deal of wind out of her sails. It really seemed as if something <i>big</i> had happened, and naturally Ran-chan must have been in the thick of it. But it really seemed as if she had no other choice but to wait until break.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki could not be forced, and it would probably be too dangerous to ask an unstable Akane. Even if she, Ukyo, was the better martial artist, Akane was still a lot stronger. And when she actually managed to connect her blows hurt like hell. No, she'd wait.</p><p><b></b>Thus Ukyo sat down at her usual desk and waited for lunch break to come. Naturally, as it always is when you are waiting for something, time crept by slower than slugs at a slug race. That was at least Ukyo's opinion. To top it off, classes had been even more boring than usual, what with Ranma gone.</p><p><b></b>But finally break time arrived. <i>Now</i> she would find out. And like a good deal of other students Ukyo ran to the door as soon as the bell had rang, and stormed out into the direction of the part of the yard where Nabiki usually conducted her business deals.</p><p><b></b>As she had expected, the middle Tendo daughter was already waiting there, her face a mask of stone. Naturally Nabiki, being the business woman that she was, waited until everyone had found his or her way into her net. Come into my net, the spider named Nabiki Tendo had said, and everyone with enough money had followed her call. At least that was the impression Ukyo got every time Nabiki had information to sell.</p><p><b></b>Then, with her customary composure the middle Tendo daughter stated loud and clear that whoever who wanted to hear what had happened to Ranma, that he or she could do so for the fee of 5,000 Yen she had appointed before and assured her clients that her information came from reliable sources. As always.</p><p><b></b>Needless to say that these were the magical words. Not even a second later the middle Tendo daughter was surrounded by ever-curious people who had apparently no life or their own, people, who had nothing better to do than to find out all about the people who led interesting lives. People, who did not even try to make their own lives interesting, for it was just so much easier to 'participate' in the lives of the interesting people.</p><p><b></b>They would surely become prime examples of spying neighbours in their later lives, so much was for sure. And Nabiki revelled one last time in the feelings that selling information and extracting money from her customers brought her, and she nearly smiled as she reflected upon how embarrassingly <i>easy</i> it always had been to extort money from her customers of whom not a single one did seem to have even an inkling of monetary value whatsoever.</p><p><b></b>And then there was Ukyo Kuonji, who had been the first one in line to pay her. Of course, she was just as interested as the others to learn what had happened if not even more so, but her motivations were not just curiousity. In her case, feelings were involved and in the past Nabiki had loved to make money out of an opportunity like this. Right now she wished that she did not have to tell the chef what had happened, but the fact that Ranma was gone was hard to hide. Well, at least Ranma was bringing in money a last time, and Nabiki swore to herself that she'd use that money to help her sister and Ranma considering Ukyo engagement.</p><p><b></b>After she had collected the money and was sure that no one was trying to listen in without paying, she counted the money and stored it away. Then she began to speak. "Well... as all of you have noticed Ranma Saotome did not appear to class the last two days. This has all to do with the fact that Ranma is no longer attending Furinkan High. As of yesterday morning his mother withdrew him from this school."</p><p><b></b>A shocked silence reigned, and Nabiki forestalled any comments by holding up a hand.</p><p>"<i>This</i> has everything to do with the fact, that as of Sunday the engagement between my sister Akane and Ranma is off, and that for good and ever."</p><p><b></b>At this point Ukyo began to cheer. <b>'Wait, Kuonji, wait before you sell the fur of the bear until you've killed it. And the way it looks now, you never will.' </b>Nabiki thought before continuing. "And as of Sunday evening Ranma Saotome has left Nerima for a training trip to regions unknown. Not even I have the information where he is headed to, and I have <i>no intention</i> to find out. And no, I won't do it for any amount of money. Furthermore, it is unknown if and when he will return. The rest is confidential, and again, no amount of money would be suffice to pay for the information. That would be all."</p><p><b></b>Muttering among themselves the students proceeded to use the rest of the break to engage in their usual activities, gossiping, eating, drinking and relaxing. The top theme was of course the departure of Ranma Saotome and the cancelled engagement between Akane and Ranma and the implications of these facts.</p><p><b></b>Some incorrigible boys, read perverts, were discussing if it would not be a good idea to revive the Hentai Horde, but those ideas were driven from the heads of these stupid boys faster than they could blink by a horde of angry girls who had heard them talk. The first time had been bad enough for them and Akane, and there was no need for a repeat performance. A thorough beating, ahem, discussion between the parties later it had been 'decided' that there would be no revival of the morning fights. And as there was no Kuno to enforce the idea of the morning fights the boys had had no other choice but to relent.</p><p><b></b>Akane whereas stayed at the side of her sister, unsure of what to do and to whom to talk. At the moment she was completely at a loss and simply needed the proximity to her sister who was now a rock in the surge for her. Even her best friends Yuka and Sayuri noticed this and kept their distance. Maybe they could offer their friend emotional assistance later.</p><p><b></b>And Ukyo still had some questions regarding this topic and had trailed Nabiki. "Yes, Kuonji?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Ukyo fixed her with a stare and ignored Akane for the moment, but as expected the stare had no effect on Nabiki. "I want to know the <i>rest</i>. What has <i>really</i> happened? Wait, let me guess... your brilliant little sister here finally managed to drive my Ran-chan away, hasn't she! Tell me! I <i>deserve</i> to know!"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki sighed. Ukyo was right. She really deserved to know, as she was an official fiancée after all. Fact, that she'd hopefully be able to change soon. "3,000 Yen more and I will tell you. But <i>only</i> you. And you have no rights to sell or tell this information to anyone. Do we have a deal?"</p><p><b></b>The chef grumbled and reached into her pocket. "Deal. Here." she said and handed the specified amount of Yen to Nabiki, who pocketed it. "Okay, what happened was this..."</p><p><b></b>And thus Nabiki began to fill Ukyo in. The other students were wisely keeping their distance as they knew what would happen if they pried in onto the conversation. The middle Tendo daughter then began to tell Ukyo how Shampoo had come crashing through the wall and had provoked a malleting through glomping on Ranma. How that had led to the dissolving of the engagement.</p><p><b></b>How Kasumi had been cursed. And how it finally had been decided that Ranma and Kasumi should go on a training trip together to get used to their curses. Which had led to the present situation. Furinkan high without one Ranma Saotome.</p><p><b></b>Ukyo was at a loss for words. "You... you mean he is going to live as a <i>girl</i> for three months or longer? And Kasumi as a boy? Are you kidding me? Ran-chan would never do that! He'd rather die!"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smirked. "Maybe in the past, but the situation has changed. And no, this is no joke. I have no sense of humour that I know of. Anyway, Cologne told us that there are no cures and that the Nannichuan is anything but a cure. She drove the point home that the curses mix when she told us of what had happened to Pantyhose Taro. Fact is, there <i>are</i> no cures and Ranma will be a half-girl for the rest of his life. That is why his mother decided that he has to come to know his girl-side so that he can accept his femininity as well as his masculinity. And just like with every other challenge Ranma took it head on. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he's already a girl and tries to stay this way."</p><p><b></b>The chef boggled. "Ranma's <i>mother</i> has decided that? Mrs. My-son-can't-be-manly-enough Saotome? And <i>Ranma</i> followed through with that? The <i>same</i> Ranma who is always boasting about his manliness? I can't believe it!"</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter smirked. "You <i>better</i> believe it. As for this whole manliness crap, you can shoot that right out of the window. His mother has cooked up something else, and I must admit that it makes sense for a change. She said something to the effect that he should strive to become a gentle person. According to Nodoka Saotome this is someone who is as much master of his own destiny as Fate will allow. And that it was apparently fate that Ranma and Kasumi received their curses and that they have to get used to them. And that is what they are doing now. As for where they are headed to, I honestly have no idea. Ranma has not even told his parents."</p><p><b></b>Ukyo had a hard time to accept this. Her Ran-chan, living <i>willingly</i> as a girl? For three months? Unbelievable! But Nabiki had no reason to lie, and her story could be checked far too easily. No, that had to be true. It was too farfetched to be anything but.</p><p><b></b>Then the anger of the chef burned high once more when she remembered who was still standing there in the background. Akane. The reason why her Ran-chan had left. "I hope you are happy now! Wasn't it enough any more to make him miserable day in day out so that you had to go one step further? Know what, "she said sarcastically, "you finally succeeded, Akane! You finally managed to do what you wanted since long: you drove Ran-chan away. Congratulations!"</p><p><b></b>Akane had a hurt and sad look plastered on her face. Inwardly Nabiki sighed. This time she could not protect her sister from the truth, nor did she <i>want</i> to. Akane had to learn that her actions had <i>consequences</i>. She, Nabiki would only ensure that those consequences would not kill her sister. "I... I never wanted it to go this far, but… but it somehow happened. I... I had a lot to think about... and... yeah, it <i>is</i> my fault. I guess... I guess it was all along." she muttered with a sigh.</p><p><b></b>That admission of guilt did nothing to placate Ukyo. "Just dandy! And you come to realise that <i>after</i> you have driven him away. Way to go, Tendo, way to go." she said angrily. "No wonder he ran off after how you treated him! Heck, I would have treated my worst enemy better than you my Ran-chan! You know what, I really don't want to know what you do to people you <i>really</i> hate."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki sighed. She should have expected that Ukyo would react this way to the training trip. That Ranma had left with Kasumi was not really Akane's fault, but one could say that her actions had led to it. One look at her sisters' face and her words told her however that Akane <i>did</i> feel responsible.</p><p><b></b>So at least something good had come out of the talk they had given Akane and the first therapy session. Those were admittedly quite expensive, but the money did not really matter if the sessions helped her sister overcome her problems. And in the meantime she had realised and admitted that she <i>had</i> problems, which was the first step to a solution.</p><p><b></b>It seemed she had already somewhat come to terms with her anger at Ranma. "Do you <i>really</i> think I am <i>happy</i> that he is gone? That he is not my fiancé any more? Heck, I loved him! I still do..." she said with tear shining in her eyes.</p><p><b></b>Ukyo however was having none of it. "And what a nice way of showing it you had! With a mallet to the head each time that was convenient to you, which seemed to be always, with poisoned food no one would have touched with a twenty feet pole and with mistrust! Why he even ever considered trying out that toxic waste you call cooking and actually even tasted it when he could have eaten my delicious food is beyond me. Everything would have worked out for me, but <i>you</i> had to drive him away! And now I won't be seeing my Ran-chan for three or more months! It is all your fault!" she exclaimed, using words against Akane the Tendo girl had so often hurled at Ranma in the past.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter decided that now as good time to intervene. That had gone far enough. "Hey Kuonji, that will be enough. That Ranma's mother decided Ranma should leave on a training trip with Kasumi is <i>not</i> Akane's fault. Everything else is" Akane flinched at this, "and she is already paying for it, but <i>that</i> is not. You can't really blame her for that. And my sister has had enough, don't you see that?"</p><p><b></b>The chef threw a look at her former rival. She was indeed the very image of misery, and if she thought logically about it she had to admit that Nabiki was right. Akane was not responsible for the decision of Nodoka Saotome. <i>But</i> she was responsible for the things that had led to it.</p><p><b></b>No, she would not attack Akane. The Tendo girl had lost, ultimately lost, and she, Ukyo, still had a chance at Ranma. She would only have to wait until her Ran-chan returned to his cute fiancée. Then she would use her chance and rub it into the face of the girl who had been stupid enough to drive Ranma Saotome away.</p><p><b></b>After all, Ranma would never start something with Kasumi, would he? No, Kasumi was not his type, so no worries there. That was just too farfetched as that it could happen… "Okay, but don't expect me to pity her. She brought this upon herself."</p><p><b></b>At this Akane's trembling increased, and it was visible that she was hard pressed to keep in her tears. Nabiki sighed. Ever since yesterday her sister had apparently realised that <i>she</i> had been the one responsible for blowing everything so royally. Not <i>Ranma</i> had been responsible, but <i>she</i>. And the realisation had hurt.</p><p><b></b>But not as much as the reality that she had lost Ranma for good. It had been her accusations and her mistrust that had led to this, and she would have a hard time to come to terms with it. But life would go on. Akane was a strong person, and she would manage. With the right help which was now finally provided she would.</p><p><b></b>Finally, with one last glance at her former rival Ukyo departed. "Tendo." she nodded towards Nabiki, who nodded back. "Kuonji."</p><p><b></b>Afterwards the middle Tendo daughter nodded towards Yuka and Sayuri, and the two girls took this as a sign to take care of Akane. Talking soothingly to the still shaken up girl her two best friends took the youngest Tendo daughter between them and went to class, while Nabiki remained behind.</p><p><b></b>Silently the mercenary girl evaluated how the whole affair had gone. Most of the students had taken it rather well, aside from Ukyo Kuonji, which was no surprise. No, she'd have to do something about that engagement. She had to find a way to make the way free for her big sis, and up till now there had not been information that she had not been able to acquire. If the pay had been good, she thought with a smirk to herself.</p><p><b></b>But this was something she would be doing for her big sis, and by proxy, Ranma. A few months back she would have laughed in anyone's face who would have told her that she would actually provide help without asking for payment, but times had changed. <i>She</i> had changed. And she vowed that she would find each and any facts about the Kuonjis and the engagement. She'd provide the facts, and Ranma could worry about finding an honourable way to resolve the mess. If anyone could, then Ranma Saotome, the most honourable person she knew.</p><p><b></b>Nodding to herself she made her way back to her class and sat down in contemplation, while also hoping that her sister would get through the day. The middle Tendo daughter was glad that the Hentai Horde would not be revived, and if it should, she'd close it down this time. And faster than those perverts would be able to blink.</p><p><b></b>All the money she'd be able to make with the fights be damned, now she knew how much her sister had suffered under those morning fights and what they had done to her, but back then she had only cared about the money she had been able to make off the betting. That had changed, and she vowed that she'd never allow a repetition. What with Kuno inadvertedly out of the way things did not look bad in that regard. With slight irritation she noticed, that her thoughts had returned to Tatewaki Kuno again, and she actually caught herself thinking that she hoped that he was okay. Odd.</p><p><b></b>Five minutes later the bell rang and indicated that break was over, and meanwhile Akane had calmed down somewhat, with the help of Sayuri and Yuka. With shuffling steps she entered her class, and instantly all talk stopped. Some of the boys leered at her, and most of the girls looked pitying. "What?" she asked her best friend Sayuri after she had sat down.</p><p><b></b>Sayuri, who was sitting beside her leant over and muttered something in her ear. Seconds later Akane was red in the face. The lesson had not begun yet, so it was of no consequence that she sprang to her feet. "Listen here you all, it was nothing <i>Ranma</i> did to <i>me</i>, but what <i>I</i> did to <i>him</i>. My past behaviour shames me, and Ranma's mother rightfully dissolved the engagement. And no, I am not interested in dating anyone of you stupid boys. So bugger off or its kapowie to the moon! Got me?"</p><p><b></b>That said Akane sat down with a defiant air, and no one dared to approach her. Then the lesson began and that was good so, for now she had something to keep herself occupied with. Thinking too much of Ranma and what she had done was just too painful at the moment. She only hoped that he and her sister were well. Or was it she and her brother?</p><p><b></b>After school Akane went directly homewards. She still wanted and needed time to herself as she had a great many things to think about, and she had even declined the offer of Sayuri and Yuka to go onto a shopping spree. After all, she was still grounded, and going against her father might have worked in the past, but after how he had acted these past days she highly doubted that it would still work.</p><p><b></b>No, she <i>wanted</i> to be alone at the moment and it suited her that she was grounded, as she still needed to reflect on the things she had learned at the therapy session. She had to work at herself a lot if she wanted to become a good person and a good martial artist, that point had been driven home. The doc had said that she had a good heart, as far as he could tell from just one session, but what good did it without control over her emotions, and especially her anger? And to do that, to find and establish control, she had to find out where her anger came from and how to remedy it.</p><p><b></b>The greatest portion of her anger had been due to the fact that Ranma had brought her back from the dead, but she was slowly coming to terms with it. In the beginning, after she had been ripped away from the peace and serenity she had felt in her mothers' presence she had been half-insane with anger and grief. Despite that she had tried to live on, had tried to bury it as deeply as possible.</p><p><b></b>But she had been constantly confronted with the one person who had ripped her away from her mom and the absolute perfection of the Afterlife, and her anger at Ranma had increased more and more until it had finally led to the last boil-over which had then resulted in the loss of the engagement. She had not even told Kasumi what had caused her anger, as she had sensed that not even her sister would understand why she had malleted Ranma even for breathing. Add to it that Kasumi had taken Ranma's side more and more in the last months, which would have made understanding on her part highly unlikely, in her opinion.</p><p><b></b>Now, in hindsight she knew how unfair she had been to Ranma, and that he had brought her back had been proof that he had loved her. But 'had' was the keyword here. With her anger and grief because of what Ranma had done she had killed that love, that she had realised. And Ranma's mother had been right, it really had not been her time, or else she <i>would</i> have stayed dead. And to think that she had insulted Ranma's mother the way she had. As hard as it was, she would have to apologise to her.</p><p><b></b>She had shamed her family with her actions, which <i>had </i>been immature and uncontrolled, just like Nodoka Saotome had accused. The reality hurt, but she could not afford to run around with glasses before her eyes that showed her a version of reality how she wanted it any more. Not if she wanted to master her life. She had her next therapy session Thursday, and if she was honest to herself, she was looking forward to it.</p><p><b></b>She had now realised that she had problems, and working on them to come to grips with them and her life was a priority now. Add to it the Dr. Jagakawa was a very friendly and patient man, which helped loads. She would master her temper, and she knew that she had to rethink her opinion of boys. At least of those who did not attend Furinkan High…</p><p><b></b>With a new resolve she entered the house, and with a quick "Tadaima", only to notice that nobody was at home, she went straight to her room to think.</p><p><b></b>At the same time Nabiki had remained at school to meet with one of her associates, her second-in-command to be exact. She wanted to be informed about the situation regarding Tatewaki Kuno, and she had just the idea how to achieve that.</p><p><b></b>Once she had entered her office she noticed that Akemi was already there. Good. "Akemi, do your friends Kaede and Naoko still work at the local hospital?" she asked, coming right to the bottom of things.</p><p><b></b>Akemi nodded. "Yes, chief."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smirked. "Good. Contact them and tell them to find out anything they can about Tatewaki Kuno. Pay the usual standard fee if they're successful."</p><p><b></b>The younger girl nodded. "Yes, chief. I'll do that and keep you informed. If they're as efficient as always answers should arrive in a maximum of three hours. Both have shift this afternoon." she said smirking.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter mirrored the smirk. "Good. Oh, and Akemi..." she said, and the girl turned around, "you know that you'll inherit my position after this term, don't you?"</p><p><b></b>Akemi nodded confidently. "Yes, chief."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smiled her icy smile. "I will leave you my contacts here at Furinkan, but any blackmail material I have collected I will destroy. Regarding that you will have to start your own batch, as I had to."</p><p><b></b>Her second in command sputtered. That was not going as she had always imagined. "B... but..." she sputtered.</p><p><b></b>The icy smile deepened. "Take it or leave it, Akemi. Your choice."</p><p><b></b>Akemi sighed. "Okay, chief. I'll take it. The contacts have to be enough. I'll go and inform Kaede and Naoko and will call you once I get the info. Till later!" she called and left the office.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smiled. "Bai bai."</p><p><b></b>Then she sat down in her office chair and laid her feet onto the desk. Looking around she sighed. She would miss this, and today had been her last opportunity to make a quick yen. From now on, that she swore to herself, she would never blackmail anyone ever again.</p><p><b></b>Besides, she was sure that activities like she had engaged into at Furinkan high would be highly punishable at College. And she had no intention to go into jail, thank you very much. No, she would erase all proof of her activities here, which would be a piece of cake for the soon to be ex-Ice queen of Furinkan High.</p><p><b></b>Her older sister had been right too, it <i>would</i> be a weight off of her soul too, and money was not everything. They'd find other ways to keep the money flowing, and if her father had to teach classes again to do so, so be it.</p><p><b></b>Hmm, maybe she could convince Nodoka to threaten Genma into helping out too. Yes, resorting to blackmail in a case like that was surely no sin, and probably even auntie would approve of it in face of the greater good. It would more be like poetic justice to get the freeloader to work. And it would be so much fun to see the useless idiot squirm.</p><p><b></b>Nodding to herself she got up, left her office and locked the door. Then she made her way home, all the while thinking of how Genma would react. That would surely be funny.</p><p><b></b>When Nabiki returned home, one hour later than Akane, Nodoka and Soun were seated in the sitting room, while Genma-panda was playing with a tire in the yard as much as his bandages allowed. He was so absorbed in his useless activity that he hadn't even noticed her. Feh. Some martial artist he was.</p><p><b></b>She shook her head. How could this man always harp on his son about being in cursed form all the time when he was a panda more often than a man? And caused Ranma to change half of the time? What a  then she mused that it was not a bad thing in his case that he stayed a panda. Genma-panda could not talk so much nonsense, as his stupid signs could be ignored any time.</p><p><b></b>Apparently Nodoka and Soun were discussing Kasumi. ..."she will be a man now half of the time. You must face it, Soun. You now have a half-time son named Yoshiro Tendo, and I am sure that he won't go back to how it was. I had a hard time in accepting that Ranma is now my daughter as well as my son. But I do <i>now</i>, Soun, because there is no other way. And from now on everyone has to help in the household. Think, it could even be that they don't return for a longer amount of time than the three months. And with the curse, Kasumi can never be a traditional woman again. Nor do I believe that she would <i>want</i> to. She is now half-time man, and once she has gotten used to this, do you think she will be a traditional woman any more? I doubt it. Highly."</p><p><b></b>Soun nodded slowly. What Nodoka had said made sense. He sighed. "I see your point, Nodoka. And if you can accept that you have a part-time daughter then I can accept that I have a part-time son. And who knows, maybe those two part-timers will hit it off." he said in a dreamy voice.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka giggled. "So you noticed too! I think that everyone beside Shampoo did. And maybe Genma. Those two were so cute together! And with their opposite curses…" she trailed off with a dreamy look on her face.</p><p><b></b>Then, when she had returned to reality she was earnest once more. "But Soun... this time no pressuring them once they return. You saw to what it led last time. If Genma or you try anything in this regard you will see me angry. And you don't want that, do you, Soun?" she asked sweetly.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki, who was standing in the hallway, secretly watched the conversation and smirked. There was much more to Nodoka than she would ever have thought. How the Saotome matriarch was pushing her fathers' buttons was a remarkable display.</p><p><b></b>And predictably Soun gulped and sputtered. "O... of course not! Heh, I would not even dream of repeating my past mistakes, that I swore to myself. But my old friend over there may be another matter..." he said sighing.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch smirked confidently, not unlike Ranma did when in a fight. Nabiki noticed that Ranma had obviously inherited a lot more from Nodoka than only the remarkable resemblance to her mother in her female form. "Let that be my worry, Soun. If he tries something stupid he gets to know my displeasure. Remember that time six months before the training trip dearest and Ranma undertook and how Genma could not visit or train for two months?" Soun nodded. "<i>That </i>was due to my displeasure. And should he do anything idiotic he <i>will</i> get a repeat performance that'll make the original seem like a walk in the park. And yes, yesterday <i>was</i> harmless in comparison." she said evilly.</p><p><b></b>Soun gulped, and Nabiki's respect for Mrs. Saotome grew. The lady was really no one to be treated lightly, and one should evidently think twice before crossing her. Yes, someone like her could be an excellent ally. Smirking to herself she audibly closed the door and called, "Tadaima!"</p><p><b></b>"Hello, Nabiki." called Nodoka, and Soun smiled at his daughter. "How was your day, daughter?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smiled. "Profitable. And aside from that very interesting. Kuno, Tatewaki that is, collapsed this morning before class. I called the ambulance and they took him to the hospital. They suspect poisoning. Other than that, my day was quite okay."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka and Soun looked at each other. "Poison?" Nodoka asked. "Do they have a suspect already?"</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter shook her head. "No, it's too early, and besides, I have no information just yet. But I have set someone on the case to investigate. And I already have a suspicion who could have poisoned him."</p><p><b></b>"Who?" her father asked curiously.</p><p><b></b>"2,000 Yen." she said in a level voice and held her hand out. Only the twinkle in her right eye betrayed her joke, and only Nodoka caught it and had to hide a smirk herself.</p><p><b></b>Nearly in reflex Soun reached for his wallet, until the tone his daughter had used registered. Nabiki and Nodoka fell over laughing, while Soun looked unamused at the joke at his cost. "<i>Very</i> funny, daughter. So, who <i>do </i>you suspect?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki sat down, joining the others. "Kodachi. I have always suspected that she is poisoning him, but I never had proof."</p><p><b></b>"Kodachi? Isn't that this strange girl who is craving after my child? The one with that... weird laughter and the black rose petals?" Nodoka asked.</p><p><b></b>"The very same." Nabiki nodded. "The Black Rose of St. Hebereke. And ever since she returned to live with Tatewaki his behaviour has become increasingly... delusional. I always thought that she was behind it and it might just be that she has gone too far this time. I think she wanted to test a new poison but it might have been too strong. And if I'm right the authorities have to take up an ascertainment ex offio. Not even Principal Coconut with all his influence in the ward will be able to do anything against that."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka looked worried. "She poisons her own brother? And such a person is still on the loose?"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nodded sadly. "The girl is insane. As in pathologically insane. Don't fret now, auntie, but Kodachi has also poisoned Ranma in the past. Repeatedly. In fact so often, that Ranma has acquired immunity against most poisons. Which is also why he survived Akane's cooking so much better than for example Ryoga. Remember that time?"</p><p><b></b>Soun nodded sagely while Nodoka silently steamed. "This... this<i> person</i>... has <i>poisoned </i>my child? And no one has done anything against it?"</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter nodded once more. "As said, the influence of the loony Principal who is incidentally their father is really strong in this ward. I could do nothing against it. But..."</p><p><b></b>Suddenly her cell-phone rang, and Nabiki excused herself. "Moshi moshi. What? It <i>was</i> poison? Nearly <i>deadly</i>! But he will survive? Good! <i>What</i>? He had <i>hallucinogenics</i> in his bloodstream? <i>How</i> much? No wonder he was acting like a loon! He woke up shortly? What? He <i>said</i> that? And they're taking up ascertainment? Good. Hope they get this loon! Well done, Akemi. Ja ne!"</p><p><b></b>She deactivated her cell and turned back to the others. "It was Akemi. Her friends at the hospital found out what happened to Tatewaki Kuno. Apparently he was poisoned with an unknown poison that was nearly strong enough to kill him. Only his superb constitution and his excellent health saved him. The doctors were fortunately able to neutralise the poison with a broad spectrum antidote. But they also found something else in their examinations of his blood. A hallucinogenic. And a quite potent one. He had enough in his bloodstream that it was a small wonder that he could still differ between people and inanimate objects! Now the police are taking up ascertainment, because Tatewaki woke up briefly and asked '<i>Dachi, what are you doing with my lunch? Oh, if it's a new sauce then add some more. I'm hungry.'</i> I hope they get that insane bitch Kodachi!"</p><p><b></b>"Oh my Kami-sama," Nodoka exclaimed, "she poisoned my Ranma and she poisoned her own brother? This crazy girl must be locked away from society! And they would do good to throw the key away! I hope the police will get her."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki and Soun nodded, while Genma-panda was still playing with the tire, displaying his usual usefulness. None. "Me too. I hope... oh shit!" she suddenly exclaimed and her face went white.</p><p><b></b>"What is it, daughter?" Soun asked.</p><p><b></b>"Dad, Kodachi may be insane, but she is <i>really</i> well trained in Martial Arts Rhythmic Gymnastics. She would probably cream a normal police force. They'll need really good police officers with martial arts knowledge, or Kodachi might <i>kill</i> them!" Nabiki exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>"Is she really <i>that</i> dangerous?" Soun asked.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nodded empathically. "She is crazy and unpredictable. Totally erratic, but really good in her martial arts. I better place a call to the police and warn them."</p><p><b></b>And Nabiki did just that. It took some real patience, but finally she was able to break through the bureaucracy when she demanded Captain Tanaka, whose son and daughter both attended Furinkan High and who Nabiki knew personally.</p><p><b></b>Captain Tanaka listened intently and thanked her for the warning. He knew that Nabiki Tendo could be trusted, and thus he ordered the team which had originally been sent to the Kuno Estate back and sent their new, specially trained force, which only consisted of martial artists, on their way. He only hoped that they would be good enough.</p><p><b></b>The answer came twenty minutes later. The team of martial artists consisting of three men and two women had acquired some injuries, as the suspect had fought quote 'like a lunatic tiger on steroids', but finally they had been able to subdue her and were bringing her in to be questioned.</p><p><b></b>That was good news, and now to the team which should turn everything topsy-turvy at the Kuno Estate. Silently the Captain cheered. His son and his daughter both attended Furinkan High too and had to endure a lot of hardships from the idiotic Principal Kuno. And the idiotic haircuts had only been some of them.</p><p><b></b>But until now they had never had enough in their grip to justify a house raid. Luckily this had changed now, and with a big smirk the Captain placed the call and gave the team the go-ahead.</p><p><b></b>What they found was astonishing.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki was still seated in the comfy cushions of the sitting room, together with Nodoka, Soun and now Genma, back in human form. Nodoka had related to Genma what was going on, and the four, except Akane, who was still grounded and in her room, were keeping themselves busy as they were waiting for news.</p><p><b></b>As auntie had repeatedly glared at Genma and had also repeatedly fingered her katana the Saotome patriarch had considered it wiser not to even breath wrongly. Nabiki had smirked at that, and she really hoped that auntie would give the fat baka panda a few more good dressing downs in the future. It was just so funny and poetic to see the loudmouthed Genma Saotome so docile.</p><p><b></b>Sipping her tea, as it was too late for coffee, Nabiki watched the display of her cell-phone and willed it to ring. But the stupid thing remained , and some cups of tea later the cell-phone rang. It was Captain Tanaka. "Moshi moshi?" Nabiki asked.</p><p><b></b><i>"This is Captain Tanaka. Once more thank you for your warning. This could have been a bad scrape had our normal team tried to detain Ms. Kuno, and I owe you for the information you provided. We had no data that the suspect was this… dangerous. As it is, even two of our specialists have been mildly injured and need medical attention. But I digress. What we found at the estate was... enlightening."</i> the Captain said.</p><p><b></b>"What did you find, Captain?"</p><p><b></b><i>"Our searching team turned everything upside down, and it found what apparently is the lab of Ms. Kuno. Half of the substances alone are forbidden, and quite a lot of them are deadly. Then my men searched the greenhouses and found further incriminating material. Not even her father with all his influence and money will be able to get her out of this. She is presently in a cell under high security where she will be held until we can question her. But we are confident that she won't be on the loose for a long time."</i></p><p><b></b>"Good to hear that, Captain. Thank you for the call."</p><p><b></b><i>"You're welcome." </i>he said and hung up.</p><p><b></b>Once she had laid her cell-phone back onto the table Nabiki began to explain, and soon bright smiles appeared on the faces of Nodoka, Soun and even Genma. Finally that crazy loon was out of their hair. It seemed as if this had been the last they had seen of Kodachi. Things were now looking up in Nerima.</p><p><b></b>But silently Nabiki wondered, if Kodachi would really be committed this time. She herself had tried everything in the past, so it could not be ruled out, that money and influence would again achieve victory over law and order. Sighing to herself she wondered how Ranma and Kasumi were doing at the Masakis'...</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
