</div><p><b>Title</b>: A trip to self</p><p><b>Author name</b>: Trugeta</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by Rumiko Takahashi and VIZ as well as Kajishima Masaki and many others. No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 20: Ranma's life story</b></p><p><b></b>Luckily for Ranma Ryoko came out of the lab five minutes after her announcement that she'd starve to death if she did not get some real food right away. The ex-space pirate was completely restored and smirked into the round. "There, as good as new!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned from her position on the couch. "How about some sparring after we finish the meal?" she asked with a glint in her eyes.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko smirked in answer. "Sounds good, Red."</p><p><b></b>That remark caused Ranma's brow to climb into her hair. "Red? Huh? What do ya mean?"</p><p><b></b>The ex-space pirates' smirk deepened. "It fits ya, freak. I've never seen someone with just as red hair as you. So it's Red for ya." she teased.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked. "First I gotta eat and then I'm gonna find a fitting nick for ya, monster woman. Can't be creative on an empty stomach."</p><p><b></b>The two glared at each other and smiles were exchanged within the group in face of their behaviour. Finally Sasami began to serve the meal and Ranma dug in like someone who had not eaten in days. For the record, it was already 7 p.m. when Ranma had finally finished eating; much to the amusement and fascination of the others.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had eaten like a starving (wo)man and after she was finished Katsuhito explained the reason why. "Ranma needs much more food than the average person as she has so vast reserves of ki. To maintain them she needs a constant intake of calories to provide enough energy. If any of you started ki-building exercises and would start to use your ki on a regular basis, you would also need more energy, thus more food. But food is no problem, Ranma. Just eat as much as you want, I know that your ki-reserves and other powers are still expanding."</p><p><b></b>The audience absorbed this and Ryoko gave her cabbit the mental order to perform a deep scan on Ranma. She wanted to know exactly how strong the redhead was. During the fight she had come to know that Ranma could very well keep up with her, but had she not gotten some surprise hits the fight might have very well ended in a draw at least.</p><p><b></b>Over her mental link she contacted her Ryo-Ohki to give her specific instructions. <b>'Ryo-Ohki I want you to scan Ranma without anyone noticing it. If Washu notices it ain't a tragedy just make it so that Ayeka doesn't find out. I want to know exactly how strong Red really is.'</b></p><p><b></b>Ryo-Ohki looked at her and nodded. <b>'Miya miya!'</b> she sent back and began her scan.</p><p><b></b>Anyway, Ranma really seemed to be as strong as she; had it not be for her fusion with Clays Android she would have royally lost to Red instead of just merely. Ryoko's eyes gleamed in face of all the fun they could have! Against Ayeka she had never been able to go all out and she had not wanted to harm the princess as Tenchi would surely not react well to it.</p><p><b></b>She had no illusions that Tenchi liked Ayeka just as much as he liked her. Then there was also the matter of the Juraians who would surely not take well to their first crown princess being injured or worse. She was still on their black list despite the fact that her criminal records had practically gone up in smoke due to expiration. But against Red here she would not have to hold back. Whoa, those would be some fights!</p><p><b></b>After their brawl she had also calmed down enough to analyze the situation logically. This had been a necessary ability in her former life in space and with a cool head she saw everything more clearly. She had already made her first observations after the fight but the byplay that went on and off between Ranma and Kasumi <i>proved</i> that those two obviously more than liked each other.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko had learned to read body-language a long time ago and the way these two looked at each other removed her last doubts. Ranma was not here to steal her Tenchi and neither was Kasumi. But it would be a world of fun to tease Red in the upcoming months. Apparently the gender-changing individual was a lot like her and she could see in her eyes that Ranma had seen a lot in her short life.</p><p><b></b>While the others chatted Ryoko remained on the support beam above the heads of the others, one of her customary resting spots. In hindsight she was really satisfied with how the situation had turned out. Instead of another rival for Tenchi's hand (and his other parts, Ryoko thought with a smirk) she might have found a fellow warrior from whom she could learn and who she might be able to show the one or the other trick too. It would be fun for the two of them if they pushed each other constantly to become better; this was the kind of rivalry she liked.</p><p><b></b>For instance she'd love to learn how to do this cool energy wave with which Ranma had nailed her. She had never seen anything quite like that before and she had seen a lot in her over 5,000 years of existence. Ranma seemed to have an enormous potential and who knew, maybe the two of them could tap their unused potential together.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ryo-Ohki had finished her scan of Ranma and the cabbit was currently transmitting what she had found out while Ryoko interpreted the data.</p><p><b>'Miya miya miya miya miya!'</b> Ryo-Ohki sent, and Ryoko could barely believe it.</p><p><b></b>The ex-space pirates had to hide her surprise. <b>'What do ya mean she's nearly as strong as me?'</b></p><p><b>'Miya! Miya miya!'</b> the cabbit insisted.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko shook her head in disbelief. <b>'Hmm, the data makes that clear, ain't it? Red really<i> is</i> nearly as strong as me… damn, her power-level is impressive! Then there's also the fact that she's a lot faster than me…'</b></p><p><b></b>The ex-space-pirate really had no other choice but to believe her Ryo-Ohki for the little cabbit had yet to steer her wrong. Mentally she rubbed her hands as she now had <i>proof</i> that she had another decent warrior here. One that could compete with her; even best her as Ranma had proven.</p><p><b></b>Ever since then Ryoko realised Red had demonstrated that she obviously loved her companion. This meant that she needn't fear that her Tenchi might be taken away from her. When Ryoko had lost most of her distrusting reservations she had felt some kind of kinship. Yes, Ranma's stay here might prove to be beneficial for the two of them and she'd just <i>love</i> to tease the redhead.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Ayeka for her part looked interested and worried at the same time at what her half-brother had said. "Expanding ki-reserves and other powers, Grandfather? What do you mean?" the Princess asked.</p><p><b></b>The Shinto Priest looked at his half-sister. There were some things he was not ready to tell just yet as they would be an unnecessary burden for Ranma at this point in time. "Only that. Ranma's powers are still growing and she'll need a lot more food in the future."</p><p><b></b>That startled not only Ayeka. Sasami, Tenchi and Mihoshi were equally surprised. And Ryoko hid her smirk. She herself had gotten a good deal stronger lately and it would be nice to have a <i>competent</i> sparring partner for a change. Her own assessment after the scan in that regard had been satisfying but to hear it from Yosho was so much better. "She is already as strong as you and she is still growing in power? Incredible! Ranma," Ayeka said, "how came this about?" she asked curiously.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed and Ryoko picked up at hearing this from her position on the cross beam. That sounded exactly like <i>she </i>would have sounded had she had to talk about her past. "It all started after Jusendo." she began.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi interrupted her. "Ranma, you don't need to talk about it. I know it is still hard on you. It's the same for me with Kagato. So, no sweat."</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist smiled thankfully at her childhood friend. "Thanks, buddy. That means a lot. But thanks to Kasumi here," she smiled at her girlfriend, "I don't have so much of a problem to talk about it any more. But maybe I should start at the beginning. I already told Tenchi and Katsuhito some of it. Maybe it would be good if we could get everyone to hear the story."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi nodded and went to fetch Mihoshi, while Katsuhito was the only one brave enough to disturb Washu in her lab. Some minutes later Ranma had changed back to his birth form and everyone was again seated on the comfy couches or lying on a cross-beam like in Ryoko's case. Then Ranma began to relate his story.</p><p><b></b>The training trip he had been dragged off onto by his father at an abnormally early age, five, to be precise because his idiot father had feared that the influence of his mother would make his son weak and soft. That his father had drawn up a suicide-contract in which he promised to make Ranma the best martial artist of his generation as well as a 'man among men'. Here Ranma forestalled questions and promised to explain this in detail later. Gauging from the expressions on the faces of his listeners this would be very much needed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma continued to explain how he had been beaten upon constantly by his father in the 'training', how he had to fight him over food and often ended up hungry and how much he had missed his mother. At this point Kasumi had to suppress her tears but was only partly successful and softly drew her Ranma into a comforting hug. Kami-sama knew that both needed it.</p><p><b></b>Even the battle-hardened Ayeka was hard pressed to stem her tears while her little sister had not so much restraint. She was openly crying. Sasami loved her mother with all her heart and she could not imagine to not see her for over ten years. This would be something that would break her.</p><p><b></b>How hard it must have been for poor Ranma! Ryoko for her part was openly seething at what the young man had gone through. Her mother was not the best parent but this… this creature really took the fruitcake. With nuts on top. Ever since what Kagato had done to her she had very adverse reactions to people who mistreated others and now she knew why she had sensed some kinship: Red was not only a fellow warrior but she had suffered too. Scowling Ryoko listened in.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Ranma proceeded to tell everything about Ukyo including the engagement and the present situation, how his father had sold him for food countless times and stolen him back, the engagements for food and how his father had made him steal until he himself had realised that it was dishonourable to do so. Then he explained the Cat-fist training.</p><p><b></b>This time he explained it in full detail and quite a lot of the attendees had to suppress the urge to lose their lunch. Katsuhito simmered and only his iron-hard control prevented him from throwing a fit of rage. "So the idiot actually did what I feared he would do... and here I had hoped that he'd stopped after the first time it did not work…he must have realised what he did… how could he continue…" he muttered unheard by the others.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka looked at Ranma disbelieving. "Your own <i>father</i> actually did this to you? He wrapped you in fish products and threw you into a pit filled with starving cats? <i>Your own father</i>?" she asked incredulous.</p><p><b></b>"WHAT!" had Ryoko exclaimed from her position above their heads at the same time. As it was her first exclamation in quite some time everyone looked at her. Ignoring the multiple pairs of eyes looking at her Ryoko simmered visibly. "What kind of parent does that to his own child? What kind of bastard is he?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded with a chagrined smile. "I'm asking myself the same question quite often. And yup. He did this to me and all this to learn the 'ultimate technique'. Some technique if the user has to be insane to use it."</p><p><b></b>Washu piped up. "Insane? As in the pathological condition, Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist sighed. He always felt embarrassed when talking about it although it was not his fault. "In order to learn the c... c... c... Neko-ken the user has to snap. Only in this state the technique is usable."</p><p><b></b>Only Katsuhito knew better but he refrained from commenting for now. He would have to do some massive research to try to undo what that stupidest idiot of all, Genma Saotome, had done. Never would he have thought that Genma had somehow gotten his hands on a scroll for the Neko-ken. He had probably stolen the scroll somewhere and to top it obviously the <i>incomplete</i> one. Sigh. Trust Genma Saotome to mess things up royally.</p><p><b></b>No, he could not have Ranma run around in the uncontrolled, feral state. Not with the kind of powers the youth possessed and had demonstrated. If he was right with his suspicions this was even truer; he was quite certain that he <i>was</i> right for he had seen some tell-tale signs. The effects of the incomplete cat-fist training had to be remedied as soon as possible. Katsuhito nodded to himself. He'd start the research as soon as possible.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile the others were thinking what for a kind of monster Ranma's father was. It had become rapidly clear from Ranma's narration that Genma Saotome was a complete and utter fool who had used every occasion to fill his fat stomach and live off of his child until Ranma's departure from Nerima but <i>this</i>... this was just <i>hideous</i>! Who could do <i>something like that</i> to his own child! And all that in the name of training? Who was the idiot trying to fool?</p><p><b></b>Kasumi who was sitting once more beside Ranma still hugged him softly. Ayeka finally gathered enough courage to ask. "I know I will regret the question but... how... how old were you when it happened? The... the Neko-ken, I mean." she asked still shocked out of her mind.</p><p><b></b>Ranma's eyes looked haunted. "Six. I was six years old, Ayeka."</p><p><b></b>"WHAT!" everyone seemed to yell in stereo. "<i>Six</i>? You were only <i>six</i> years old?"</p><p><b></b>Ryoko simmered even more by now. She might not have had much motherly instincts and hid her feelings quite well, always covering her inward softness with her brash behaviour but she really felt for Ranma. What the young warrior had gone through was beyond worse. It was a nightmare! And once she'd found out where a certain Genma Saotome was currently living she'd become <i>his</i> nightmare. Oh yes this would be an occasion where she'd love to measure up to her reputation as a demon. Once she'd found him she'd make his life a living hell!</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma had nodded. "Yup. I was too young to understand what was going on. But after the first time I begged him not ta throw me inta the pit again. The cats were scratching me all over and I could only protect me head. He yelled at me ta stop acting like a weak, worthless girl and threw me inta the pit again. He did that for thirty days until I finally snapped. All the while before that he harped at me how I was too weak to learn the ultimate technique and what a disappointment I was."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi sighed. She remembered the talk with Ranma's father very well. When he had described the Cat-fist training to her he had indeed said that every failure had ripped out his heart. There and then he had truly sounded as if all that he cared for was the training and not his child.</p><p><b></b>She felt her anger at the Saotome patriarch rise and her resolve was reaffirmed once more. When she and Ranma had children of their own Genma Saotome would not be allowed near them. Who knew what he'd do to them? This man had proven time and time again that he cared only for himself and did not stop to think about the consequences of his actions and that he could do something stupid to their future children was nearly a given; he simply could not be trusted and she'd never allow Genma Saotome to do anything to her loved ones ever again.</p><p><b></b>Let alone how he had proven back then that Ranma had indeed a fear of cats. By throwing one at her at that time! What kind of parent did that to his own child? For instance, what kind of parent would put his own child through such a kind of torture that was the cat-fist training and would then cry that his child was weak and a disappointment because she did not want to be attacked by a bunch of starved cats? She pulled her Ranma closer to her and when he leant into her she began to stroke his hair.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Washu for her part could not believe this. She felt that she had been a bad parent to Ryoko but this... <i>this</i> literally defied description. "Ranma, where was your mother through all of this and especially when the cat-fist training happened?" she finally asked.</p><p><b></b>With a sigh the pigtailed youth said, "As said, I was on a ten year training trip with stupid pops. I was in Osaka at that time. While she was in Tokyo, at home. Believe me, mom didn't know. She <i>still </i>does not."</p><p><b></b>Ayeka had still trouble grasping it. "I still... can't believe that <i>anyone</i> could do that to a little child. Their own child to boot. Not even the Zark'dorn are that cruel!" she exclaimed and blushed somewhat when she noticed what she had said. Terra had never had contact with them which was good.</p><p><b></b>Ranma scowled. Neither he nor Kasumi had caught her slip of tongue. "And that's not all of the idiotic stunts baka oyaji has pulled. But what really annoys the hell outta me about the Neko-ken beside that I snap is that the baka didn't even bother to read the next page."</p><p><b></b>"What did it say?" asked Washu.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed. "It was a very definite warning in very big letters that said <i>'Only an idiot would teach someone the Neko-ken, because the student will die. If extremely lucky, the student will go hopelessly insane.</i>' Heck, that's only the half of it!" he said with a haunted look in his eyes.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka was not sure she did <i>want</i> to know. But like when witnessing an accident morbid curiosity won in Ayeka. Whereas Katsuhito nodded to himself. Genma <i>had</i> indeed used the incomplete version of the training. "W... what is the other half, Ranma?" Ayeka asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed deeply and Kasumi deepened the hug. "Ya saw how I reacted ta Ryo-Ohki." the cabbit picked up at hearing her name and Sasami scratched her behind the ears. "Cause of the freakin' neko-ken I can't even be <i>near</i> a cat! I usually run away in terror when I see a c... c... one of ´em things but ya don't know what happens if I'm around 'em for too long..." Ranma trailed off.</p><p><b></b>Everyone except Ranma and Kasumi gulped. Katsuhito looked like he was about to explode for he <i>knew</i> where this was leading. Finally Ayeka asked "Ranma-kun, did he really think that that was some kind of martial arts training? It sounds to me like a torture manual, and its application would be highly punishable on several wor.. ehm, continents. "</p><p><b></b>Ranma snorted. Again, neither he nor Kasumi had caught Ayeka's near faux-pas as both were too absorbed with the story and the feelings it brought up. "Training like that was baka oyaji's specialty. Call it School of Saotome Genma - Fat Fool Style. He did not think; he just <i>did</i> it and usually to me. Whenever he got a new scroll he'd try it on me regardless of the warnings on it. After all, it was not his face his stupid stunts blew up inta. No, it was mine. And he pulled a lot of stupid stunts. Do ya know what he did ta increase me speed? The idiot bound me to a speeding train! While he sat on the rear of the train and watched me run. Once a fool, always a fool." he said flatly, "And I <i>learned</i> the neko-ken technique but it wasn't what panda no baka expected."</p><p><b></b>Washu looked at him with an expression seldom seen on her face. Care. "What happened, Ranma?" she asked softly.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist sighed once more. "As I was saying if I'm around c... c... 'em things too long the c... c... Neko-ken takes over. I go insane. I'm almost invincible and much stronger but I go crazy from the fear, lose my mind. I also 'gin to act like 'em things. I have no memory of it but I've been told the only way ta get me ta snap out of it is ta get me ta fall asleep around someone I trust or ta activate my curse. And I absolutely hate it!" he said with conviction.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko was hard pressed not to explode in power and hunt a certain Genma Saotome down. How could this idiot have done something like that! She hated abusive people and this father of Ranma absolutely took the cake. Yes, she'd later on ask her mother nicely if she could help her in finding out the address of one Genma Saotome. A 'goodwill visit' was called for, oh yes…</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Everyone else nodded in understanding and Washu gave Ranma a sad smile. "Ranma, I promise you that I will do everything in my power to help you. I won't even put you through embarrassing examinations. But I'll need to make some scans of you and take some samples. In both forms. It is necessary and does not only serve to satisfy my curiosity. This is to help you undo the damage an immoral and sadistic man has done to you. Believe me I have met a lot of monsters in my days and your father is either a monster or the most callous and thoughtless being I have ever heard of."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko growled. "As far as I am concerned he'll soon be one of the deadest beings I have ever heard of…" she mumbled to herself.</p><p><b></b>Ranma snorted. "That's pops alright. The ep… epi… umm, Kas-chan what was the word again?" he asked with a sheepish smile.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi smiled back. "Epitome, Ra-kun."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Yeah, that. Pop is the epitome of thoughtlessness. He lives by the motto act first and ask questions a long time later. And the idiot always believed others over me! Ya have no idea how glad I am to be away from him; I only realised in the last weeks just how annoying he really was. Ya know what he did at home... um, the Tendo Dojo?" Shaking heads. "He usually woke me up by throwing me outta the window and inta the koi pond. Then he would harp on me for being a weak, worthless little girl. Even though I beat his fat Panda ass in training all the time and with a blindfold ta boot as they say. He is a woman hating idiot and when we return and he harps at me for being 'a dishonour' cause I am a 'weak, worthless little girl' I will beat him within an inch of his life. And I'll <i>enjoy</i> it. For I have started to getting used ta my female side and won't stand for his insults any longer. I don't say that I like the curse but I've started ta accept it. And he that will not hear must feel." he stated and cracked his knuckles.</p><p><b></b>Now Ayeka piped up. "Umm, Ranma, what with your female side... how came that about?" she asked and Ryoko perked up. That part interested her especially as she wanted to eliminate the last traces of danger from Ranma in the rivalry department. Ayeka was bad enough…</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist sighed. "Stupid pops fault." he said and the others nodded. They had expected this answer. "When we were in China my old man and me went to these 'special training grounds'. Pop had bought a guidebook in Chinese cause it was cheaper but the fat idiot can't even <i>eat </i>Chinese! Properly at least. Turned out that those training grounds were the cursed grounds of Jusenkyo also known as the pools of Sorrow. There existed literally hundreds of Springs and each had their own tragic history of someone or something who or which had drowned in them. And cause they were magic springs the one unlucky enough to fall into a Spring is cursed to turn into that what drowned originally in the Spring. And ya can guess inta which Spring I fell." he said meaningful.</p><p><b></b>Mihoshi looked confused. "Um... nope, I don't get it at all!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked into the round with an expression that said 'Is she for real?'. Upon seeing a curtly nodding Tenchi Ranma answered the question anyway. "I fell inta the Spring of the drowned girl." he said in a slow drawl.</p><p><b></b>"Oh my!" Sasami exclaimed, "That must have been a shock for you!"</p><p><b></b>"I should think so." Ranma answered. "Well, it happened this way: Pop and me entered the 'training grounds' of Jusenkyo and it was really one. Out of the Springs I mentioned protruded bamboo poles which were obviously meant ta test ones balance while running over the course of Springs. One can say much 'bout Pop but he's a competent martial arts teacher if he does not decide ta do somethin' crazy. Pop and me are masters of balancing and we used the poles ta fight; jumping from one ta the other and trying ta dunk the other inta a Spring. All the while the guide of Jusenkyo tried ta warn us. Then I scored a hit and launched pop inta a Spring. Seconds later a giant panda emerged from the Spring! I was so shocked that I dropped me guard and pop, still enraged, ploughed me inta the Spring of the drowned girl. And suddenly I had two new and very prominent parts while another one was missing. Imagine my shock."</p><p><b>'Other prominent part, huh?'</b> Washu thought, <b>'Well, his name <i>is</i> Ran ma, 'wild horse'. If nomen est omen</b>¹ <b>he'll make Kasumi very happy... though I must say that they're in an unique situation with their opposite curses. A study involving those two might be called for. Just thinking about all the samples I could take and all the test results makes me giddy! And then the suggestions I could give them...' </b></p><p><b></b>Had Sasami been able to hear Washu's thoughts she would probably have said 'Oh my, Washu, you're naughty!' out of general principles. Due to the fact that the little princess had no mind-reading abilities she only continued to listen to the story of Ranma's life.</p><p><b></b>Then she decided that Ranma could need a glass of water for all this talking surely made thirsty. "Be right back." she said and went to the kitchen.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma continued his story. "I had turned into my worst nightmare cause for my whole life baka oyaji had taught me that girls were weak, stupid 'n worthless. And now I turned inta a girl with just the touch of cold water or any other cold liquid! Ya know, the curse turns the cursed victim inta a water magnet and that ain't no joke! Ask Kasumi!" Ranma said and Kasumi nodded empathically. "Ya wouldn't believe the crazy cold-water-accidents I have had ever since I got the curse."</p><p><b></b>Also Tenchi nodded. "We have seen it too. It's true."</p><p><b></b>At just this moment Sasami returned with the glass of water for Ranma. "Here you go, Ranma-kun. You surely must be..."</p><p><b></b>That was as far as she got for her right foot suddenly got caught up in the carpet. As a consequence she lost her balance and stumbled and the glass of water went flying.</p><p><b></b>Naturally right at Ranma and Kasumi. An instant Ranma-onna and Kasumi-otoko later everyone except Tenchi, Katsuhito and the cursed individuals boggled. "I... see." Washu finally said. Then her eyes gleamed. "It will be most fascinating to study this curse."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko shuddered at the tone of voice her mother had used and she was glad that her… scientific interest was not directed at her Tenchi for once. Poor Ranma.</p><p><b></b>"Unbelievable!" Ayeka exclaimed. "Those accidents happen how often per week?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist snorted amused. "Better ask how often per day, Ayeka. It often happens several times a day. This is also the most stupid part of the curse. Not the changing o' forms for I'm slowly getting used ta it." she said with a loving look at Kasumi-otoko. Then she looked Ayeka in the eyes. "But the wet clothes are really annoying. And I can't use my new powers to dry myself in public. That would scare people shitless! Also, it still does not help Kasumi."</p><p><b></b>Ayeka nodded. "That would indeed make you look like an oni. No, that is not an advisable option."</p><p><b></b>Ranma who had snuggled up to Kasumi-otoko continued her tale. "Back to the story." Then she turned her head and smiled up at Kasumi-otoko. "You're comfy, you know that?"</p><p><b></b>That evoked a pleased smile from Kasumi-otoko and he began to stroke her hair. Fact that all attendees found quite cute. Especially Katsuhito was glad that Ranma seemed to have found his/her soul mate. If anyone deserved this then she.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Ryoko on her part was relieved too as she saw this as final prove that Ranma would not be a danger to her and her plans for her Tenchi. <b>'Hmm, it seems that Tenchi and Ranma are friends from long ago. Maybe Ranma can also become my friend aside from a sparring partner. That could better my position and real friends are hard to come by…'</b> she mused.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed youth continued comfortably snuggled up to her love. "Ta take up the plot again now I was cursed ta turn into what pop had taught me to despise. A girl. Complete in body but with a guys mind. Ya know, Cologne told us some things 'bout the springs. She said that the Spring gives the cursed victim the cursed body and a... how did ya call it, Ka-kun?"</p><p><b></b>"A kind of manual how to handle the cursed body, Ra-chan." Kasumi-otoko answered. He'd taken to call Ranma-chan Ra-chan rather than Ran-chan for he knew that the pet-name 'Ran-chan' held a lot of memories for his love, and not all of them good.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist on her part nodded and blew her boyfriend a kiss. "Yeah. That. And that is also why some friends of us who are cursed ta turn into animals are able ta handle the cursed bodies. Know what? Had it not been for my stupid pop and his teachings and had he not been constantly harping 'bout how weak and all around worthless girls are I would've gotten used ta the curse much earlier. I've begun to but it will still take some time until I become completely indifferent ta it."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko had refrained from scolding Ranma for her slip in language skills as this was obviously pressurising her a lot. But Ranma had to learn. "Ra-chan, try to speak more feminine. You are a girl right now so speak like one." he said and gave the crown of her hair a soft kiss.</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist looked sheepish. "Gomen, Ka-kun. I will try to. But this is <i>hard</i> for me."</p><p><b></b>The cursed Tendo stroked her hair.<br/>"I know, Ra-chan. It is the same for me. But give it your best." he said. Then he snipped a finger. "Imagine your father and how he would react when you speak in a feminine way. What would that do to him?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned. A devilish grin. "You're right. That would really drive the baka Panda up the wall, wouldn't it?. Thanks, Ka-kun. That will help."</p><p><b></b>The Masaki household had followed this exchange with interest. It was really obvious how good these two were for each other. They knew from the story that had Ranma ended up with Akane the cursed youth would probably have <i>never</i> gotten used to his curse. But Kasumi was really what Ranma needed and obviously vice versa.</p><p><b></b>"How long have you been cursed, Ranma-chan?" Washu asked. The scientist had her recording device activated the whole time. This was interesting and maybe she could help them.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked at Washu and chose her words carefully. All the while she imagined the fat panda with his stupid signs. "A bit more than one year now. Oh yeah and I forgot the other reason why I had no chance ta accept my curse. Another one of pops brilliant ideas that nearly blew into my face. A Seppuku contract. Turned out... it turned out that pop drew up a contract that stated I would be 'A man among men' when I returned from the training trip. If mom would not deem me worthy I had to commit ritual suicide together with pop... my father." she corrected herself.</p><p><b></b>That caused gasps all around. Again. Who would do something like that to their own child? Which father would be so immoral to come up with something like that and which mother would accept it? They could only imagine Ranma's horror when s/he had found out about the terms of the contract.</p><p><b></b>While the blood was slowly returning to the faces of the attendees Katsuhito was silently shaking his head. Why had Nodoka allowed Genma to take Ranma and why had she accepted the contract? He really could not understand how Genma could have done something like this to his own child.</p><p><b></b>"Let me get this straight." Washu said. "Your brilliant father drew up said contract that said you would kill yourself if you were not manly enough in your mothers' eyes? Heck, what is that for a load of bull rap?" she nearly yelled, and everyone shared her opinion. "Let me guess: your curse complicated the situation somewhat, eh?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma snorted, and then nodded. "You can say that again. I found out about the contract by chance. Naturally I believed Pops description of mom. I had seen her often enough in my cursed form and she was always carrying the family honour blade with her! Pop said if she knew that I was cursed to become a girl she <i>would</i> kill us. But I doubt that the fat fool would have ever held true to his word and committed Seppuku. He has <i>never</i> kept his word if it was not to his benefit so why should he go through with it when his life was on the line? Anyway, when mom was visiting us at the Tendos' where we were practically hiding from her I had to be Ranko Tendo, the cousin of Kasumi and her sisters. I had to hide from my own mom, the mom I had not seen for ten years! It was so damn hard and all of it because of the fat panda! Do ya know how he got me to sign the contract?"</p><p><b></b>Everyone present shook their heads. But knowing Ranma's father it was something incredibly low-down. "The idiot let me play with finger-paint and then made me finger-paint a piece o' paper. I signed a Seppuku contract with a fingerprint I playfully put on it! I was five at that time and I had no idea what I was doing! Idiot pop said that my mom would hold me to a contract I did not even remember I had signed cause I was too young! How low can ya... sorry… you… get?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>When she had corrected herself she had done what Kasumi had suggested. Imagined the fat, useless Panda. And had thought <b>'Grrr, throw a crying fit, stupid Panda!'</b></p><p><b></b>A hushed silence had grasped the room. Obviously Genma Saotomes' idiocy knew no bounds. If the decision were up to them they would let Ranma never return to this man. After all, Ranma was a legal minor until she turned twenty and Genma could make a lot of decisions for Ranma till then; especially if he would let him/her be declared insane because of the Neko-ken. All that was needed to prove that was a bunch of cats as could be gauged from Ranma's story.</p><p><b></b>But Ranma was not finished, not by a long shot. "And pop made me believe mom would hold me to the contract and make me kill myself. I didn't remember my mom and dad knew her a lot longer than me. I had no reason to doubt him. After all, she had accepted a contract I had signed with a handprint! And cause... sorry, because of the katana it was a lot more believable. I really thought my mom would make me kill myself because of the curse. Stupid pops never said anything to the con… cont… help me a sec, Ka-kun."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled. "Contrary, Ra-chan." he said, still stroking her hair softly.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled in thanks. "Yeah, that. The stupid panda really made it seem as if mom would hold us to the contract. He made her seem like some kind of monster that would make us kill ourselves when she found out about the curse. But luckily mom did not hold me to it, but I <i>would</i> have gone through with it. All that because of pops and a stupid piece of paper."</p><p><b></b>At this a lot of people gasped and Katsuhito was rather pale. Kasumi-otoko had reached out with his right hand from behind Ranma and had grasped her right hand with his while he continued to hold her with his left arm around her waist. Once again it was a nice feeling for Ranma and she really could get used to the feeling of being protected.</p><p><b></b>Gratefully smiling Ranma continued. "As I said, had mom decided that I was unmanly she would have been my second. Unlike the fat, spineless panda <i>I</i> have honour. But in the end she said I was manly nuff even with the curse. You know why? Cause I fought stupid pops over a family treasure. The stupid idiot nearly got her killed and all that cause of his stupid greed!" she spat. Then she launched herself into a more detailed description of how her mother had found out that she was Ranko Tendo and how she had saved her mother. "But she had really strange ideas of manliness till after the wedding."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded and explained the many talks he had had with Ranma's mother and also described the views Nodoka had had on what was manly and what not. The audience soon grasped that it had been incredibly hard for the oldest Tendo sibling to change the views Nodoka Saotome had had of manliness and everyone was happy and relieved that he had succeeded. Katsuhito however looked chagrined, especially after hearing Nodoka's former definition of manliness. How had it come so far? Where had it all gone wrong?</p><p><b></b>"Wedding?" asked Mihoshi after Kasumi-otoko had ended his explanation.</p><p><b></b>Ranma looked pained once more. Then she described the failed wedding and everything up till now. When she had ended everyone was baffled once more. "You had to go through this day for day, buddy?" Tenchi asked with sympathy.</p><p><b></b>On everyone's faces one could see compassion and the more aggressive members of the Masaki household which were foremost Ryoko and Ayeka were thinking along the lines of how a panda fur would look on the wall. The rivals for the hand of Tenchi shared a look and nodded. Oh yeah, a 'goodwill visit' was indeed what the doctor had prescribed.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. "Had it not been for Kasumi I'd have gone crazy. I don't even wanta think about what would've happened then." she said shuddering and then leant into her boyfriend even more. Everyone else nodded somberly. They had seen what Ranma was capable of...</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>After Sasami had served some cookies and tea Ranma described the situation with Akane in detail. How she had arrived in female form at the Tendo Dojo when the Tendos had expected a boy. How Akane had befriended her because the youngest Tendo had sensed that she needed a friend and how this offer had been taken back faster than Ranma could have said "Sorry 'bout this" when Akane had found out that the girl was a boy.</p><p><b></b>How Akane had screamed "PERVERT!" loud enough to shake the foundations of the house and how it had shaken Ranma to the core. She told the Masaki household that she had been cursed for two weeks at this time; that she had doubted her manhood and simply everything about herself and had seen herself as a freak. Then there had been this girl who had wanted to befriend her and had twisted this offer around like a knife in her flesh.</p><p><b></b>Ranma then described the betrayal she had felt when this girl had suddenly shunned her because she was a boy. How Akane had called her a pervert ever since then for the simplest acts and reasons or lack thereof. Granted, before Jusendo Akane had hit her less frequently, that she admitted, but everyone agreed that this had been one unhealthy relationship which might have ended in a tragedy.</p><p><b></b>The Masaki household shuddered when Ranma described in detail how Akane had reacted when she had become his fiancée and especially when she had said 'I'm better built to boot', namely with a table creamed over the head. Then Ranma described how she had been treated by Akane for the last year, how the fathers had acted, the fiancée brigade, Ryoga, Mousse, the Kunos and the rest.</p><p><b></b>How all this had changed when Nodoka had found out how Akane treated her child and how Akane had blown any chance with her forever. How Kasumi had been cursed and how everything had led up to now.</p><p><b></b>Needless to say the Masaki household was shocked; but silently every single one of them silently vowed to make them feel welcome. After what they and especially Ranma had been through they deserved peace and quiet but most of all a normal life. Well, as normal as it could be around a household of aliens.</p><p><b></b>Then Ranma related what she and Kasumi had told Tenchi and Katsuhito about how they would stay in their alternate forms for the next three months and how Ranma planned to go to school in her female form as Ránmā Saotome.</p><p><b></b>Washu nodded to herself. That made sense. After what Ranma had told them about her life she knew it had been the best decision to leave Nerima and come here. Here both Ranma and Kasumi would have the chance to get used to their curses without disturbances like Genma Saotome or the other crazies Ranma had described. Although it seemed that a permanent removal of the variable labelled Genma Saotome would be the better solution. For the world.</p><p><b></b>Not to mention that Nodoka Saotome and the other women had been right; getting away from Nerima had been the best choice. The two were on a good way already, which she could see. And all of them would help the two cursed individuals on the way.</p><p><b></b>Washu nodded to herself. Ranma needed love and friendship. Love she would get from Kasumi, in both forms. Friendship would be provided by all of them. Even by Ryoko. Though it seemed that the kind of friendly rivalry that had been formed between the two did the both of them good.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi looked at Ranma and grimaced before his face lit up. "Ranma, let me tell you something, buddy: your life in Nerima was hell, pure hell. I'm sure I would have blown up the whole place a long time ago. But now you're here and all will change for the better. Grandpa and I will help and teach Kasumi how to be a man. I'm sure the girls will show you how to be a girl, right, girls? We'll help you two." he said and smiled at his friend.</p><p><b></b>A chorus of "Rights!" echoed throughout the room.</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned back and Kasumi-otoko smiled a likewise thankful smile. "Thanks, buddy. To all of you. We thank you." she said.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi grinned. "You're welcome. I'll be your friend as I was in our childhood and I swear on my honour that I won't betray you. Your gender does not matter in that in the least." he said with conviction and a smile. Ranma's face lit up like a nova, so brilliant was her smile. The Masaki youth had to look at Kasumi-otoko to prevent as nosebleed, so kawaii was the sight. "The same goes for you, Kasumi. We'll be your friends and we'll help you."</p><p><b></b>Mihoshi squealed with joy. "We will help you learn how to be a girl, Ranma! It will be so much fun!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Washu and even Ayeka nodded with a smile although the latter shuddered to think what Ryoko's contributions to the project might be. Inadvertedly she looked up at her rival and to say that she did not like the devilish smirk on Ryoko's face would have been an understatement.</p><p><b></b>Curiously Washu thought along the same lines. Then she nodded to herself. She'd have to have a long talk with her daughter about how to handle the situation. After all, Ranma had been through enough already and did not need more problems. The next three or more months she should concentrate on her girl training. Without interruptions if possible.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled into the round. It was the first heart-felt smile, except to Kasumi, in months. "Thank you, all of you. But let me get back to the story how my powers increased. It all happened after Jusendo." she said, still with a somewhat haunted look.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi wanted to say something but Ranma shook her head at him with a smile. "Its okay, Tenchi. Thanks to all of you and especially Kasumi I can now talk about it. You have all been very friendly and kind to Kasumi and me and I feel that I can trust you. It happened all after Jusendo. The place where I killed for the first time and meant to do it."</p><p><b></b>Holding Kasumi-otokos hand Ranma began to relate what had happened at Jusendo to a spell-bound audience. The full uncut truth. The call for help from Jusenkyo in the form of Plum, the daughter of the Jusenkyo guide. How they had learned of the Phoenix people. How Kiima and her thugs had battled the Nerima wrecking crew for the 'Jusenkyo Secret'.</p><p><b></b>How Shampoo had been attacked and trapped in a giant egg and then upon hatching controlled by Kiima, unbeknownst to them at this time. How Kiima had succeeded to get the complete map and had returned to Mount Phoenix with her companions and Shampoo.</p><p><b></b>How they had travelled to China and their troubles there with the onsen devil and how they had 'convinced' him to help them. How the onsen devil had later turned out to be the Phoenix King Saffron. How they had battled the Phoenix people and learned what had happened to Shampoo. How the enemy had found out about Akane and how they had abducted her from Japan to drown her in a spring.</p><p><b></b>How they had succeeded in creating the Spring by nearly drowning Akane and how Kiima had cursed herself to take Akane's shape to deceive them and that she had succeeded. How they had reached Jusendo with Plums help after they had seen Jusenkyo go dry. How Shampoo had stood guard against intruders and had fought them.</p><p><b></b>How his worthless father had fallen under Shampoo's control. How they had gotten away from Shampoo and his father. How Akane had finally escaped and how she and the others had fallen down what they later realised was a giant water pipe.</p><p><b></b>How they had literally stumbled into Saffron's arms when they emerged from this pipe and how Saffron had used him to become stronger. How Akane had been turned into a small doll. The happenings leading to Shampoo getting back to normal. How Saffron had hatched too early and how all had climaxed in the final battle. How he had stood before the decision to kill Saffron or to let Akane and the others die.</p><p><b></b>She told them about the tremendous powers Saffron had possessed including the ability to regenerate nearly instantly. How she had managed to fire a revised version of the Hiryu Shoten Ha at Saffron after a lot of tries and how it had been nearly too late so safe Akane. How she believed that she had brought Akane back to life by yelling at the heavens. That she had killed an honest to goodness god for her. And that it still had not been enough in the end.</p><p><b></b>She had said the last with so much sadness that Kasumi-otoko hugged her from behind. Smiling gratefully at her boyfriend she said "But that is in the past. Now that Kasumi 'n me have found together I can leave the past behind me. But you wanted to know how I got more powerful. Well, Cologne, the Amazon Elder I talked about thinks that I absorbed some or most of Saffron's powers when I killed him. Personally I think that she is right. Ever since I came back from Jusendo I felt this new well of power in me. I became faster, stronger 'n tougher. As you saw I have these fire-based powers and have begun to mix them into my ki-attacks. And as Katsuhito said my powers are still growing." she finished.</p><p><b></b>The others nodded somberly once more. "You have led an interesting life, Ranma. It really seems as if you are the epitome of the saying 'May you live in interesting times.'" Katsuhito mused.</p><p><b></b>Ranma snorted. "Tell me somethin' I dunno." Then she paused for a second. "You know, could you tell why all of your auras are so strange? It ain't unlike anythin' I have ever sensed before. Reminds me somehow of Saffron, though."</p><p><b></b>Multiple sweat drops ensued. It seemed as if it was time to let the cat out of the bag...</p><p><b></b>¹ Latin, means 'the name is an augury'; the meaning is that the name says a lot about a person</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group. I enjoy reading your comments, and the suggestions you all make will help to make this story even better.</p><p>If you find anything illogical that might have created a plot-hole or anything else that is wrong, let me know and I'll fix it.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
