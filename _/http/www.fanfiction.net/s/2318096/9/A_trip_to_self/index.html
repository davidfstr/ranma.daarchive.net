No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 9: Project: Ally of the tribe</b></p><p><b>The Nekohanten</b></p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon, Matriarch and leader of the Chinese Amazons, was busy. That was nothing new to her, but the actions she planned to initiate now might be decisive for her tribe in the future. And she was determined to do what was best for the tribe, even if it would not be the best for her great-granddaughter. It had always been a hurtful and sad truth that some personal sacrifices had to be made for the greater good, and there was no greater good than the well-being of the tribe.</p><p><b></b>This day had been a real eye-opener to Kuh Lon in this regard. She had sensed before that Xian-Pu and she might not be able to win Ranma over as Xian-Pus' Airen, as saddening as that would be for her great-granddaughter. It had soon become clear to her after her arrival in Japan that Ranma could not be forced, and drugs, herbs, blackmail and aphrodisiacs had not led to success either.</p><p><b></b>If anything, it had strengthened Ranma's declinature of Xian-Pu's love. Kuh Lon nodded to herself. In their arrogance and firm believe of female superiority they had handled Ranma Saotome wrongly. And now that Ranma had proven to be stronger than probably the whole tribe put together there was nothing they could do to enforce her Xian-Pus claim without serious repercussions.</p><p><b></b>No, she could not and would not endanger the safety and the future of the tribe she herself had architected through the fruitless pursuit of Xian-Pus airen. Rather she'd create a situation from which both the tribe and Ranma would profit. Alas, if only they had known Ranma's true potential from the start and had treated the Saotome youth differently. But that was now in the past and could not be changed.</p><p><b></b>Not even the Nanban mirror could be of help in that regard, as it was destroyed for good. Sure, there were other means to alter the past, but they were equally or even more dangerous than the Nanban mirror ever had been. Add to it that those dangerous and unstable items, which would have only been used by a fool, were not in the possession of the Joketsuzoku.</p><p><b></b>No, the past was unchangeable, and that was good. For who knew what could happen if they still had the power to play around with time? Would they be able to resist the temptation? And what would be the outcome? Maybe the end result would be a Ranma who was not strong and resourceful enough to beat Saffron, which would in return lead to a much darker present and future. No, it was good this way, and her enterprise would at least ensure the future help of Saotome Ranma with a high probability.</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon sighed and started the computer. What had happened prior was in the past, and could and especially should not be changed. The other Elders and she had long since understood that attempts to change the past were more often than not doomed to fail. Which was also the reason, why the Joketsuzoku didn't strive to obtain the means necessary for temporal travel any more; rather they destroyed them wherever possible nowadays. The danger to mess up the timeline with these dangerous tools was much too great, and attempting to do so could very well be the undoing of the tribe; which was exactly the reason why temporal travel was now explicitly forbidden.</p><p><b></b>After reflecting on this the Elder shook herself out of these musings and entered her password to boot the computer. She silently cackled to herself. If son-in..., no, Ranma, she corrected herself, only knew that the Joketsuzoku were not as backwards as many believed. It would surely be funny to see the face of the Saotome youth should he/she find out.</p><p><b></b>Indeed, it was a little known fact and definitely a well-kept secret that the Joketsuzoku were quite up to date. After all, this was the 21st century, and the Joketsuzoku possessed an ultra-modern data processing centre located beneath the village, which was constantly kept up to date. They had trained SysOps and Admins, and every Elder had her own laptop with satellite-uplink.</p><p><b></b>Only because they were warriors it did not mean that they had to live like  all, which cunning warrior refused to use means that were to her advantage?They had proven to be adaptive and had long since established themselves in the Chinese government; nowadays they were influential enough so that the rulers in Beijing left them alone. Which was just the way the Chinese Amazons wanted it to be.</p><p><b></b>The next enterprise Kuh Lon had in mind was to remove the glaring contradictions within her  the outsider rules were the foremost among those contradictions. These rules, born in times of need and carried on as a tradition over the centuries might have served them well in a time were they still had the chances to remain hidden and occasionally brought the odd strong wanderer into the tribe.</p><p><b></b>But Kuh Lon had really started thinking about the signification of the outsider rules after they had been discovered by Beijing several decades ago. Gladly everything had gone well back then and satisfying contracts had been made (not lest due to their very persuasive memory techniques), and their privacy and independence had been assured. Though it could not be denied that the world had lately become a much smaller place due to the progressive spread of modern technology.</p><p><b></b>Due to her stay in Japan Kuh Lon had learned that it would become a necessity for her tribe to open up to the world in the future, and maybe they'd even have to adjust some of their values in light of the rapidly changing world. Though those were considerations for the future, even if they were of importance.</p><p><b></b>But she knew she'd have to do something about the outsider rules some time in the near future, especially after the fiasco with Ranma. And with the help of her fellow Elder and good friend she'd manage it. They had to act and make the tribe even more adaptive, for anything that remained unchanged and unchangeable in its ways was doomed to be crushed by the irresistible gears of time. This was something the Elder had come to realise in the quest for Xian-Pus airen, much to her chagrin.</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon sighed once more. She had sent Xian-Pu, yet another victim of the overcome outsider rules, to her room early and had taken precautions so that she could work undisturbed. To this end, she had spiked her great-granddaughters' tea with a mild sleeping potion. Nothing too strong, it was just enough to take her out of commission until tomorrow. Which would, unbeknownst to the Matriarch, come in handy later.</p><p><b></b>The Elder regretted to have to resort to such means, but Xian-Pu was not to know what was going on. Not yet anyway. She would find out soon enough anyway, and three to four months (or even more) were much too soon for her taste. Kuh Lon would need a strategy to calm her great-granddaughter down by then, for she knew how much her Xian-Pu loved Ranma. She massaged her temples once more. No, Elders did not get a headache. It was not dignified. Ahh, better!</p><p><b></b>And besides, that her great-granddaughter was enjoying a good nights sleep would enable her to check the spice-rack later. She still needed to find out if Xian-Pu had used some of them to 'help' Tendo Akane lose the engagement. But that was of secondary importance now in face of matters that pertained the well-being of the tribe.</p><p><b></b>An acoustic note brought Elder Kuh Lon out of her musings as the computer indicated that it had loaded the OS. The matriarch started the IRC, and then she entered her password and logged into the Joketsuzoku net. In times like this she silently congratulated herself that she herself had led the negotiations with the Chinese government back then, which resulted in over-all good connections for the tribe and laid the foundation for the modernisation of the Joketsuzoku. The tribes' future was now ensured, and Kuh Lon was rightfully proud of herself.</p><p><b></b>She was even prouder that she had overcome any resistance regarding the modernisation of the tribe, and it was a situation like this that proved the naysayers wrong. Had she not insisted on her plans, the Joketsuzoku would still decline themselves the uses of modern technology and its undeniable advantages. They might be living like their ancestors to keep themselves strong and ready for any battle but that did not mean that they had to deny themselves the progress the modern civilisation had made. Had she not insisted on modernising the tribe she would have had to do what she was planning the old fashioned way; it would have taken weeks, if not months.</p><p><b></b>Which would have been far too long in any case in the powder-keg that was Nerima. The tribe had to be capable of acting and reacting without delay despite where its members were presently located, and the modern technology assured that. After reflecting on this, Kuh Lon directed her attention towards the screen. She had work to do.</p><p><b></b>Good evening, Elder Cologne.<br/>You have 0 new messages.<br/>4 users are online.<br/>Enjoy your stay. </p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon nodded to herself and switched to a secure, fivefold password protected channel, reserved for Elders only. Now she only hoped that Dou Ve, her substitute in the village during her absence, was online. And Kuh Lon began typing...</p><p><b>To</b>: Dou Ve, Substitute Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku</p><p><b>From</b>: Kuh Lon, Head Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku</p><p><b>Subject</b>: Change in Plans</p><p><b></b>Dou Ve,</p><p><b></b>unexpected happenings have led me to the decision to dissolve the Kiss of Marriage and the Kiss of Death between Saotome Ranma and my heir, Xian-Pu. This might come unexpected, but I have my reasons, which will be explained in the following.</p><p><b></b>Surely you have heard of the rumours that the Phoenix King Saffron has been defeated and killed by the male Saotome Ranma. These rumours are true. The warrior Xian-Pu and the male Mu-Tzu can give testament to this. As can several outsiders, for this matter.</p><p><b></b>I have witnessed the power Saotome Ranma possesses myself today, and it is safe to say it impressed even me. <i>Very</i> much so. Not even the <i>combined power</i> of the Joketsuzoku would be able to stand up to her. And no, I don't  you well know that is not my nature.</p><p><b></b>I refer to Saotome Ranma as female due to the fact that she was in female form when she gave a display of her powers. However, it is safe to assume that Saotome Ranmas powers as a male are even greater.</p><p><b></b>You will certainly agree with me that it would not be safe to bring a male, even if he is a half-male, who wields power that rivals a god into the tribe. I have the statement of the male Mu-Tzu that Saotome Ranmas powers are now <i>even greater</i> than those of the Phoenix King, and I have no reasons to doubt him.</p><p><b></b>The best course of action is to make Saotome Ranma, male and female, a full ally of the tribe. You know our estimations as well as I do, Dou Ve. Any other course of action, especially attacks from our side would lead to disaster. We <i>can not</i> afford to make an enemy of Saotome Ranma. He might have been born a male, but he is so much more.</p><p><b></b>My decision is to make Ranma, regardless of the form, a full ally of the tribe. Relate my reasons to the other Elders and see to it that my will is executed swiftly. There is no room for error.</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon.</p><p><b></b>Satisfied with the contents of the message the Elder send it to her substitute. Inwardly she admitted to herself that it had done good to type in Chinese once more, for on some days the Japanese language gave her a headache the size of the mainland.</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon rubbed her tired eyes as she sat before the monitor. Sipping her tea she sighed once more. If only there had been another possibility to bring Saotome Ranma into the tribe. But Fate had seemingly had other plans, and all that was left option-wise was the course of action she had just initiated.</p><p><b></b>She only hoped that she had been able to convince Dou Ve with her reasoning. Dou Ve <i>had</i> to see reason, for it would be very difficult for her to convince the other Elders if Dou Ve did not follow her lead.</p><p><b></b>But Kuh Lon was confident. Had it been her former substitute, Mu Tzu's great-grandmother Bii Da¹, it would have been hopeless. The old hag had been opposed to everything she had ever done, and the reason why had been clear. Bii Da had wanted Kuh Lons position for herself, but she had been too reckless in her schemes. Or she, Kuh Lon, had been too cautious. Anyway, the outcome had been the same.</p><p><b></b>Bii Da had fouled up, and it had been a special treat to expel the old hag from the Council and revoke her status as an Amazon Elder, which had also consolidated her own power and had enabled her to become the Head Elder of the Council; it also had had the nice side-effect that Mu-Tzu had become much less of a nuisance.</p><p><b></b>And it sure helped that Dou Ve, Bii Das successor, was one of Kuh Lons oldest friends and quite influential herself, for thus Kuh Lon was quite sure that her plans would be approved of. She only needed Dou Ve's approval, and the other Elders would follow.</p><p><b></b>Rubbing her eyes once more she mused about the happenings of the day. Had it really only been one day? So much had happened. First the youngest Tendo had screwed up royally, then Kasumi Tendo had been cursed, and it had come to light that Saotome Ranma and Tendo Kasumi were apparently attracted to each other. Make that not only apparently, but quite obviously.</p><p><b></b>Even if they, quite likely, would not admit it either to themselves or the other at present time. And finally Ranma's incredible display of power. The child never ceased to surprise her. Had she been two hundred years younger, she would have been tempted herself. For the first time since long, Kuh Lon allowed her thoughts to drift. She did not know for how long, but to her it seemed like hours.</p><p><b></b>The acoustic note of an incoming message raised Kuh Lon out of her musings. The answer she had eagerly awaited had obviously arrived. Before she opened it she looked at the computers watch. Way past 10 p.m. already. She had been sitting here for more than one hour. <b>'Tempus fugit.'</b> she mused. Shrugging she opened the message, anticipation prevalent in her being.</p><p><b>To</b>: Kuh Lon, Head Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku</p><p><b>From</b>: Dou Ve, Substitute Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku</p><p><b>Subject</b>: Re: Change in Plans</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon,</p><p><b></b>I must admit that I am surprised. And nothing surprises me easily, as you well know. So the rumours are true, ne? Who would have thought that a male, even if a victim of the Nyannichuan, would be strong enough to defeat and kill the Phoenix God?</p><p><b></b>But I digress. I have related what you have pointed out, and I have given the course of action you proposed my full approval. Needless to say, it has caused quite a stir. Two of the younger Elders forgot themselves and wanted to attack Saotome Ranma immediately to 'eliminate a threat to the tribe', but we made them see reason. And that all too gladly. #cackle#</p><p><b></b>If what Xian-Pu, Mu Tzu and you yourself said about the powers of Saotome Ranma is true, and we had no reason to doubt it, then attacking him or her would lead to certain disaster. And I know all too well that it is not within your nature to exaggerate, which made the decision easier.</p><p><b></b>After that it was unanimously decided to proceed as you suggested. Saotome Ranma, in both forms, will be made a full ally of the tribe with all rights and duties. He/she and all his/her descendents will forever be exempt from the Outsider rules. The Kiss of Marriage as well as the Kiss of Death between your heir Xian-Pu and Saotome Ranma are from now on officially dissolved, without any repercussions for both parties. The official documents will be faxed in a minute or two.</p><p><b></b>This is the decision of the Council.</p><p><b></b>Dou Ve.</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon breathed a sigh of relief. If they had decided differently... no, there was no need to dwell on what ifs. The decision had been made in the way she had hoped and silently prayed for, and it was good. After all they (and especially she) had done to Ranma, he/she deserved this.</p><p><b></b>It had taken some time for Kuh Lon to admit it to herself, but she had grown fond of Ranma and wished the child the best. That had also been the reason why life had been somewhat quieter for Ranma after the failed wedding. She had exerted her influence on Xian-Pu and had made it clear to her that she would have to win Ranma without her help. After all, it could be interpreted as favouritism that she had helped her great-granddaughter at all.</p><p><b></b>Since generations young Joketsuzoku warriors had had to master the task to win their Airen for themselves, and Kuh Lon had come to realise that she had already done too much. She'd have to answer some awkward questions should her actions ever be revealed, but she'd made sure that this would never be the case. And after the outsider rules had been replaced or completely revoked it wouldn't matter any more anyhow.</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon was very glad that the way she had helped Ranma also presented a way for her heir to preserve her honour. The Elder shuddered to think of the fate that would have awaited Xian-Pu had the council decided that she had failed in her pursuit of Ranma. But that was in the past. Now, even if he did not know it yet, Ranma could begin to find him/herself and build a future.</p><p><b></b>With a lighter heart Kuh Lon typed an answer.</p><p><b>To</b>: My Substitute</p><p><b>From</b>: The Matriarch</p><p><b>Subject</b>: Re: Re: Change in Plans</p><p><b></b>Dou Ve,</p><p><b></b>it is good to see that the council followed my wisdom. Let me guess: the two Elders who were at first opposed to my plan and who had to undergo behavioural correction were Sci Sor and Foe Hn. I always said that those two were too young and immature. Idiots! Always ready to jump the gun without further thought! I may repeat myself, but 150 is no age to attain a Council seat. Bah! Younglings! It warms my heart that you and the others made them see the error of their ways. Did they resist much? #cackle#</p><p><b></b>And Ranma's power really <i>is</i> that great. You would not believe the battle aura she exuded! It melted the underground in seconds and nearly blew us off our feet! Believe me when I say that Saotome Ranma has more power than I have ever witnessed before in my over 300 years, and I don't doubt that he/she is on a good way to become one of the strongest individuals on this planet.</p><p><b></b>We did the right thing. Now I have 'only' to convince my great-granddaughter of it. Oh the joy!</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon.</p><p><b></b>Satisfied with her answer Kuh Lon leant back and sipped her tea. It was already cold, but that did not matter to the Matriarch. She had just set the empty cup onto the table, when suddenly the fax machine came to live, and a minute later Kuh Lon held the official documents in her hands.</p><p><b></b>Documents that declared the Kiss of Marriage and the Kiss of Death null and avoid. Documents that also declared Saotome Ranma, male and female an ally of the tribe, his/her approval provided; plus the insurance that he/she and all of her family and future descendants would forever be exempt from the outsider rules (as long as those still were standing).</p><p><b></b>For the first time this day Kuh Lon grinned. If Ranma approved of this, and the Elder was sure that he/she would, they'd gain a very powerful ally soon. Mentally she congratulated herself, for she had made the best out of the situation.</p><p><b></b>Smiling a satisfied smile she pocketed the documents in her personal stuff space and leant back once more. Seconds later the computer gave off an acoustic note. Ahh, Dou Ve had obviously answered. Kuh Lon clicked on the message and read.</p><p><b>To</b>: The old ghoul</p><p><b>From</b>: Another old ghoul</p><p><b>Subject</b>: Re: Re: Re: Change in Plans</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon,</p><p><b></b>I agree. We did the right thing. I did not want to admit it at first in case you thought me senile in my old days, but the power surge exuded by, how I now know, Saotome Ranma, was even felt here. A lot of Elders felt it too, and this was also one of the reasons why this decision was made so swiftly after the other Elders had added one and one. To make an enemy of her is not an option! However, this has already been established and serves only as background information.</p><p><b></b>And you're right as almost always. It were indeed the Elders Sci Sor and Foe Hn who wanted to go onto the warpath. I admit it was fun to put them down a peg or two. And yes, they did resist much. In the beginning… #evil laugh#</p><p><b></b>I don't want to be in your shoes however, sister. You'll probably have much fun when you break the news to the 'kitten'. #cackle# Pardon the pun.</p><p><b></b>In conclusion, something official: try to make Saotome Ranma an ally of the tribe as soon as possible. We are waiting for a confirmation.</p><p><b></b>Signing off,</p><p><b></b>Dou Ve.</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon grimaced and typed. Oh yeah, it <i>would</i> be so much fun to break the news to her 'kitten'. But she would postpone it for now. It would be much better for her eardrums and her sanity.</p><p><b></b>No, she would tell Xian-Pu when she was old enough to be on the Council herself. By then, she would hopefully be mature enough to understand her reasoning. Yes, that sounded like a plan. And in the meantime she'd keep her great-granddaughter so busy with chores that she'd have no time to brood on the situation.</p><p><b></b>Cackling to herself she continued to type.</p><p><b>To</b>: The younger old ghoul</p><p><b>From</b>: The older old ghoul</p><p><b>Subject</b>: Re: Re: Re: Re: Change in Plans</p><p><b></b>Dou Ve,</p><p><b></b>it does not surprise me that the power surge was felt even in the village. Heck, it would not surprise me if it was felt world-wide. It's only a good thing that the annoying male he-whose-name-is-a-curse-in-our-tribe is touring Europe at present. Unthinkable what would have happened had he been present. Had he been able to absorb ki from her in that state, he might have become an even greater pest. But I digress.</p><p><b></b>Of course I will try to make things official as soon as possible. By the way, do you think it would be suffice to tell the 'kitten' the change in plans once she is old enough to take her own place on the Council?</p><p><b></b>And what do you mean 'as <i>almost</i> always'? I am <i>always</i> right! #cackle#</p><p><b></b>Signing off,</p><p><b></b>Kuh Lon.</p><p><b></b>Satisfied with herself she logged off and shut the computer down. Then Kuh Lon got up and went downstairs. Another cup of tea was called for. She had just set a kettle on the stove when she heard a knock at the door. Producing her staff Kuh Lon went to check who it was.</p><p><b>A while earlier</b></p><p><b></b>Ranma, Kasumi-otoko and Nodoka were still sitting in the sitting room, while Nabiki had excused herself and had returned to her room. Nodoka had, unbeknownst to the younger attendees, recovered from the shock that the mentioning of the name Masaki had induced in her, which might also have something to do with the excellent performance they had given some minutes before.</p><p><b></b>How her daughter and Kasumi had interacted had brought hearts into her eyes, for those two had really acted like a couple! Even if they had been in their cursed forms at that time. Their act had been so convincing that Nodoka had barely resisted the urge to scream 'grandchildren!'. How those two had looked together, like the perfect couple.</p><p><b></b>It had not even disturbed her that Ranma had been her daughter at this time, and for the first time she was glad that she had shot her view of manliness out of the window. Those two were so cute together! And the concept of her child being a gentleman or gentle person suited Ranma much better, and her child was acting a lot more carefree than ever before. Kasumi had been right, she <i>had</i> been pressurising Ranma without even realising it. But those times were over now, except for the odd push her child would still need to accept her femininity.</p><p><b></b>Presently Ranma was telling Kasumi-otoko about her experiences at the Masaki house, and Kasumi was listening spellbound. The looks Kasumi was giving Ranma during this were very much to Nodokas' liking, and the casual and carefree way Ranma was relating the story showed that a lot of the stress that had affected her child in the past was gone. It was so nice to see her child smile for a change and did her as her mother a world of good.</p><p><b></b>Normally Nodoka Saotome would have enjoyed such a sight immensely. But right now she could not enjoy it as much as she usually would have, for she was again reflecting upon what she had learned from her child before the Kuno-incident. She should have <i>known</i> that Genma would do something stupid. But to stop by there, after what had happened... that was really stupid, even for Genma.</p><p><b></b>Otherwise she had to agree with Ranma's assessment. It would indeed be the perfect place. Surely Genma had already forgotten everything, after all, according to Ranma it lay more than ten years in the past. Or so Nodoka hoped.</p><p><b></b>She could also not say anything to Ranma that regarded the Masaki clan. She just could not bring herself to do so. Nodoka only hoped that her child would not hate her once he/she found out. Now she could do no more but to listen to her child and hope to read from her narrations if Kasumi and her child would be welcome.</p><p><b></b>..."you know, they have this really big house. It's awesome! I bet you'll love it there! Tenchi, his pop and his grandfather surely have enough room, so I don't think we even have to announce that we're coming. We can just go on a training trip into the region and be there in a week or two. Ain't it cool?" Ranma enthused.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko nodded and smiled. Ranmas enthusiasm was infectious. "Yes, Ranma. It sure sounds great. But are you sure that we do not need to announce that we are coming?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled back and waved it off. "Me 'n Tenchi wrote each other for years. He always said I could come and live there if need be. Sadly I had no contact to him ever since I went to China, or to term it better, was dragged off there by oyaji. And ever since I came to Nerima I never really had the time to sit down and write Tenchi. But I'm sure we're welcome!"she exclaimed with a smile on her face.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otokos smile deepened, and not only because of what Ranma had said but also because of her beautiful smile. "If you're sure. Oh, I still have to pick a name for my new ID-card."</p><p><b></b>Footsteps could be heard from the stairway. "You got that right, 'bro'. The only thing I need now are the names you have chosen for your cursed forms. All I need now are those names and the new ID can be created. So, have you picked one?" Nabiki asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned. "Should be obvious in my case. After all, I pretended to be Ranko Tendo, and I hated it. It was just not me and if I'm going to live as a girl, then as myself. So it is totally clear that I'll stick by the choice we made – I'll be Ránmā Saotome."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nodded, and Nodoka smiled. She had expected as much. "And you, bro? How will my big bro be named?" Nabiki asked in jest.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko thought for a moment. He had not really had the time to think about an appropriate name until now. "Hmm... how about Yoshiro²? I liked it when Ranma used the name to fool Kuno." he stated.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki pondered this and smirked. As did Nodoka. Ranma looked thoughtful, and then she nodded with a smile on her face. "Due to the curse this is true, Kasumi. Mmh, it is appropriate. And I like the name. I had not even thought about the meaning of the name when I pretended to be your wife to confuse Kuno. Really, I like it."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko smiled. Ranma's approval meant much to him, and when she had said that she liked the name he had felt strangely pleased. "Thank you, Ránmā-chan." he said, pronouncing the name correctly.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled back. This coming from Kasumi was not so bad, it was more something of a compliment. After all, 'chan' was only used for familiar and close persons. "You're welcome, Kas-chan." she said without thinking.</p><p><b></b>Then it dawned on her. Damn, she had done it again! She had used a pet name for Kasumi, and this time Kasumi was even in male form! Man, what a slip of tongue! But Nodoka literally glowed once more, and Nabiki wore an amused smirk. In her opinion it was still too funny to see how Ranma brought him/herself into such situations.</p><p><b></b>But like last time, Kasumi did not object, rather he looked pleased at what she had said. And Ranma grinned inwardly and analyzed the situation. <b>'Kasumi looked <i>very</i> pleased when I said it <i>and</i> he blushed. And when we hugged in the kitchen a while ago it felt <i>very</i> good. This is definitely different from what I felt for Akane. For one, it is more intense, and then there is this strange feeling when Kasumi smiles at me, and that in both forms! Could it be that I more than only like Kasumi?'</b> she mused to herself.</p><p><b>'Would that be so bad?'</b> another half of her mind asked.</p><p><b>'Kasumi is only a <i>friend</i>!'</b> the first half shot back, clearly on the defensive.</p><p><b>'Sure, keep telling that yourself. But you couldn't even fool the baka panda with it. No, Kasumi is <i>more</i>, and you know it! Why did the hugs feel so good if she's only a friend? And why were we so pleased when she blushed at the pet name? Admit it, Saotome, she is <i>more</i> than a friend!'</b> the second voice shot back.</p><p><b>'...'</b> came from the first voice.</p><p><b>'See? I told you so!'</b> triumphed the second voice with glee.</p><p><b>'Oh, oh,'</b> Ranma thought as she shook her head, <b>'now I know I am losing it... I am hearing voices. Maybe one too many hits to the head from the uncute tomboy... but the voices got that right... Kasumi <i>is</i> more than a friend. It remains to be seen how much more...' s</b>he mused.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile the others were watching her with interest. Ranma noticed this, looked up and blushed. "Sorry, I spaced off for a bit."</p><p><b></b>Giggles and laughter ensued, causing Ranma to blush even more. After Kasumi had gathered his bearings (he had been extraordinarily pleased with the pet name) he had to ask his sister a question that burned under his nails. "Nabiki, I must ask you how you plan to get new ID-cards for both of our cursed forms. I hope it is nothing illegal, for I would hate to see if you were put to jail for helping us. Please tell me it is not something illegal." he said with obvious concern in his voice.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki only smirked her high-and-mighty smirk in return. "Now that would be telling, bro."</p><p><b></b>Now Nodoka intervened. She had not really given it much thought until now, but Kasumi had raised a valid point. If what Nabiki did to get the ID-cards for Ranma and Kasumi was illegal, she could very well be send to prison. And that for a long time! "Nabiki, your brother is right. This is no peccadillo if it is illegal. Please alleviate our worries and do tell." she said in a gentle but at the same time commanding tone.</p><p><b></b>Finally, after some moments of intense internal debate Nabiki gave in. She absolutely hated to reveal her tricks, but it seemed as if she had no other choice. She knew how persistent auntie and Kasumi could be. "Okay, fine. Rip a woman off her secrets, will you." Then she sighed. "To pacify you, it is nothing illegal, far from it. To be honest, I have cooperated with the Jusenkyo Products Ltd."</p><p><b></b>At the two incredulous and one curious stares Nabiki elaborated. "Auntie, Jusenkyo Products Ltd. is a business company that specialises in products for curse victims. And as you all know, the springs existed for a very long time and a lot of people have fallen into gender altering springs. Ever since modern means of identification like ID-cards have become common and their possession a duty throughout the modern world, the Jusenkyo Products Ltd. provides documents describing the curse, all scientifically approved of course. Their documents are airtight, and the administrations of the modern countries had no choice but to accept the curses as true facts, especially after some demonstrations of the gender-changing curses. In our homeland a special bureau dealing with Jusenkyo victims has been established in the 80s, and they help fast and unbureaucratic."</p><p><b></b>"WHAT!" exclaimed the three listeners in stereo.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki smirked. "Yes, there is an authority dealing with Jusenkyo curses, and of course it's strictly secret. The Jusenkyo Products Ltd. faxed the data they had of you, Ranma, to said bureau, including an eye-witness account from the Jusenkyo guide. For a fee, of course. A fee I paid, I might add. The only thing necessary and missing is to fax the data I have on Kasumi here to the bureau, including the pictures I took." she finished.</p><p><b></b>To say that Ranma, Nodoka and Kasumi were baffled would have been a clear understatement. "There... there is a <i>bureau</i> for Jusenkyo curse victims?" Ranma managed to ask.</p><p><b></b>"The... the curses are common knowledge?" Nodoka asked at the same time.</p><p><b></b>Kasumi-otoko just sat there, at a loss of words. Nabiki smirked. It was good to know that she'd it still in her. "To answer your question, Ranma, yes, there is. To answer your question, auntie, no, not common knowledge. But the higher ranks in the administration and in the government, to which the 'Bureau Dealing with Jusenkyo curse Victims' belongs, do know. And now that I know the name for my older brother, I'll get to work again. The agency works fast and they have an express delivery, so it should be ready soon. And don't worry, I chose nice photographs for your new IDs. Trust me." Nabiki said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>"Umm, Nabiki," Ranma began, "today is Saturday."</p><p><b></b>"And?" Nabiki asked, "They don't have weekends. This is a highly specialised agency." she finished as if that would explain everything.</p><p><b></b>Nice and helpful as this all was, one thing irritated Ranma immensely. "How come you never told me before of this bureau? It could have spared me a lot of trouble with my other form in the past." she annotated. "For example, I wouldn't have had to run off as if all hell was on my heels each time a police officer wanted to talk to me because of the odd fight I was involved in my cursed form. It could all have been much easier! Especially during the one time when I was locked due to the Cats Tongue. Those were over three weeks where I had no way to prove my identity!"</p><p><b></b>Nabiki held up a placating hand. "I would have told you if I had known myself, for a fee, of course." she said smirking. "But I just recently learned of this myself. And cause I still owe you a favour and because I <i>want</i> to help my sister and you I began to make preparations. Apropos, gotta get back to work. After all, you wanted to be off before the old men return, ne?" she asked and went upstairs, without waiting for an answer.</p><p><b></b>Ranma leant back. She felt like she had been hit by a freight-train. A freight-train being driven by sheer astonishment. Who would have guessed that Nabiki would pull the strings for her? Not that she minded, but it was unusual. Hmm, maybe it was Nabiki's payback for the profit she had made through all the photos. That could be it.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly a thought came to Ranma. "Mom, Kas-chan," this time she used the pet name voluntarily to see the cute blush, "if Nabiki is right, and I don't doubt that she is, the IDs will arrive soon. The old men are still out and will probably be until early next morning which will give us enough time, but Kasumi and I still need a head-start. What we still need is the soap. And tomorrow will be far too late. I'll go and get it!" she said.</p><p><b></b>A peck on the cheeks of both Kasumi and Nodoka later, and Ranma was off. She was already out of the door when Kasumi touched the spot where she had kissed him, and Ranma did not see the pleased blush appear on his face. Nodoka did and smiled to herself. Hopefully things would work out. But it sure looked promising…</p><p><b></b>Some minutes of rooftop-hopping later Ranma landed in the backyard of the Nekohanten. She dusted herself off and knocked at the backdoor. Hopefully the old ghoul was still up…</p><p><b></b>¹ if anyone knows the real name of Mu-Tzus' great-grandmother, let me know<b><br/></b>² means "free son" in Japanese</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group.
