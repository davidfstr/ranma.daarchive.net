</div><p><b>Title</b>: A trip to self</p><p><b>Author name</b>: Trugeta</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by Rumiko Takahashi and VIZ as well as Kajishima Masaki and many others. No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 27: Just visiting – Nerima style</b></p><p><b></b>When Tenchi, Ranma, Ayeka and Ryoko arrived in the main-room (Ranma still marvelled at how spacious this <i>one</i> single room was) they noticed that Washu was already sitting on one of the sofas. She was clad in a red jumpsuit that went excellently with the colour of her hair and the scientist was presently busy sipping from her coffee.</p><p><b></b>The diminutive scientist noticed the newcomers instantly and sent a glare their way that told them that they had interrupted her with something important. Ryoko however had assured Ranma that Washu was always this way when she got called out of her lab and that she should think nothing of it. So the other redhead did just that and sat down while the others followed her example.</p><p><b></b>A grumpy Washu looked at Tenchi. "So what do you want from me? I was right in the middle of a great scientific discovery so it better be important!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi sweatdropped. Whoa she was really in a funk. "It <i>is</i>, little Washu. Our request pertains our training, among other things; as you certainly know from your observations we fared… err, rather badly against that Android. Ranma here has offered to increase our natural speed so that we don't have to rely on our special powers so much. And that's where <i>you</i> come in."</p><p><b></b>Washu nodded to herself. She still maintained her grumpy expression but her interest had been picked; and sadly, for her, Tenchi knew this. "Right. And what can the greatest scientific genius in the universe do for you?"</p><p><b></b>Ryoko rolled her eyes at her mother's antics. "Red here knows a way how ta increase our speed." she began and then described the chestnut-fist and how it was learned.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka nodded after Ryoko had ended. "Yes, and now we want to know if you can think of a way to make it a bit… safer. I must admit that I'm not very fond of both methods. Do you have suggestions, Washu-chan?"</p><p><b></b>Washu's eyes gleamed like always when her genius intellect was challenged. "So this is a speed-exercise you say… hmm if we use the water-method less injuries are going to ensue if we replace the piranhas with something more safe… on the other hand I could provide you with portable shields to protect you from the heat generated by the other method… then I could also invent artificial koi that deal out mild electric shocks if you don't catch them in a given amount of time… of course I'd have to arrange it thusly that the combined strength of the electric discharge of all koi won't kill you…" she mused to herself; then she looked up with a cheerful expression. "Those are your options. Your choice."</p><p><b></b>The four teens stuck their heads together and discussed. Ranma strongly suggested using the water method as they implicitly needed the stimulus of at least mild pain to improve. Using a shield to block away the heat in the alternate method would be cheating and not have the desired effect. This argument served to convince the other teens. Once more it was Tenchi who acted as spokes-man for the other two. "We have decided upon the water-variant, little Washu. How soon can you have them ready?"</p><p><b></b>The scientist looked at her watch. "Hmm, now we have 1 p.m. … Ryoko, contact me again in four hours. Is there anything else or can this genius get to work again?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma nearly didn't dare to ask but as she feared nothing she piped up. "Actually there is, little Washu. I need your help in contacting my mother and Mr. Tendo. They've gotta know what happened and I'm sure the two will wanta visit once they're brought up to date. But I got no idea how ta contact mom except via mail. Who knows when she's gonna check her inbox next? And as I dunno the phone-number of the Dojo and as my love ain't in no condition to tell… well ya catch my drift."</p><p><b></b>Washu's eyes lit up at having yet another challenge presented to her genius intellect. "The first part is easy. That's something you can do too, by the way. Just use the net and use the phone-book from the net. Wait, I'll create a wifi user-profile for you so that you can log in. Any preferences regarding your username?"</p><p><b></b>The redhead grinned. "Yes. I go by 'wild child'."</p><p><b></b>The other redhead nodded. To each their own. "Done. The password is preset and you can change it in your user-profile on your own. I suggest you get your laptop and log in, Ranma."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked, reached into her stuffspace and pulled her laptop out. Washu who saw her doing this feat for the first time got gleaming eyes. Damn, she was an even more fascinating specimen than she'd thought. She really wanted to uncover how Ranma had gotten as powerful as she was; that had actually been the project she'd been working on.</p><p><b></b>The reactions of the others were the same. "Can… can you teach us that technique, Ranma?" Ayeka asked nearly eagerly but with just enough composure worthy of a princess. It just wouldn't do for a princess to sound like she was begging but she had to learn that technique and thus she'd probably sounded half-begging. Who cared?</p><p><b></b>The Saotome girl smiled. "Sure can. It's a great technique for storing stuff and comes in especially handy for storing weapons which I'm sure ya will wanta."</p><p><b></b>Both Ryoko and Ayeka nodded and smirked. Ryoko had indeed her energy-sword she could form with her own power but it surely did not hurt to have a nice plasma rifle or photon cannon up the sleeve. Yes she could think of a lot of practical uses for such a technique.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi on his part was interested too as he could see the uses of that technique. His thoughts were running along the same line as Ryoko's. He had his energy sword but to have some backup would not hurt.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ranma had begun to work her laptop and the OS had already loaded. Currently Ranma was busy scanning for a wifi just as she had been taught. Like last time when Katsuhito had helped her she found it without difficulty.</p><p><b></b>Then when she had to login she entered her username and handed the laptop to Washu. The scientist typed away, hammered enter and gave the laptop back to Ranma. "There you go. Now you can surf the web. But don't forget to change the pass. I don't want to be bothered each time you want to login."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked. "As you wish, great Washu-chan." she exclaimed in jest and immediately did as the diminutive scientist had requested.</p><p><b></b>Washu threw her hands into the air. "Finally someone who appreciates my genius!" she exclaimed theatrically. "And now I'll be in my lab to think about a way how to get your mother and that other person you mentioned over here. And yes, I won't forget your artificial kois. As if the greatest scientist in the universe would forget something… so if you'd excuse me…" she said and exited the room without waiting for an answer.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko and the others just looked at Ranma and shrugged, their gesture saying 'That's normal for her, think nothing of it.' Ranma just smiled and nodded while she was busy searching the web. She had to admit to herself that being female had one advantage she had noticed: she was even better at multitasking in this form and that came in very handy.</p><p><b></b>Soon she had found a web-phonebook and mere moments later she had found out the phone-number of the Tendo Dojo. "Good. I have the number. Now does anyone know a way how to call them without giving away where we are?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi looked at her. "You mean as in anonymous?" he asked,</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. But before she could say anything further suddenly a cell-phone materialised out of thin air and dropped into her lap. A note was attached to it and the redhead read it. "Anticipated your request. This cell-phone can not be traced by anyone on this planet. Have fun. Washu-chan." she read aloud. "Wow, your mother is really good!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko nodded. "That she is if she does not try ta drag Tenchi into the lab. Or if her next experiment ain't threatening ta blow the planet ta bits. Or…"</p><p><b></b>"We get the image!" three other voices exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Ryoko looked sheepish. "Okay okay. No need to chew on my ear."</p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled. "No worries there. I like the ears of my love way better!" she said as she dialled the number of the dojo.</p><p><b></b>Moments later she had a female voice on the other end of the line.</p><p><b></b><i>"Moshi moshi?"</i></p><p><b></b>"Hey Nabiki could you please get me mom?"</p><p><b></b><i>"Ranma? Is that you?"</i> the middle Tendo daughter asked.</p><p><b></b>"Yeah it's me."</p><p><b></b><i>"Hey kiddo. I take it from the tone of your voice that this is no social call?"</i> the other girl asked.</p><p><b></b>"Sharp as ever, Nabiki. I really gotta talk to mom. Something has happened."</p><p><b></b><i>"Don't tell me you or Kasumi got pregnant already!"</i></p><p><b></b>At her end of the line Ranma presented warding signs. "WHAT! No way! Err, I mean no." she added sheepishly which told dialogue partner some juicy details without telling them. "Please get me mom now."</p><p><b></b><i>"Okay okay, kiddo."</i> Nabiki answered and obviously went to fetch Nodoka.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly loud voices could be heard from the other end of the line and mere seconds later another female voice spoke into the handset. <i>"Ranma? What has happened, my child?"</i></p><p><b></b>Ranma collected herself. "Hi, mom. Something… has happened here. The house got attacked and Kasumi got injured. Mom, he nearly got killed cause he tried ta save me! And I had no chance to tell him how much I love him! And I thought he was dead!" she exclaimed nearly ready to erupt into a torrent of tears due to the memories.</p><p><b></b>Her mother did not even think to reprimand her child for being unmanly. This was her daughter in distress; and like any good mother Nodoka decided to act. <i>"Ranma, dear, we'll get to you as soon as possible. I want to see Kasumi and you and I'm sure that Soun will want to too. Don't worry about your father; Nabiki can keep an eye on him. Lately we've got him under control quite well."</i> she said and one could hear the mirth in her voice.</p><p><b></b>Just hearing her mother so supportive instead of reprimanding served to raise Ranma's mood. The silent support she felt from her friends in the background was a big help too. "Thanks, mom. At the moment he's healing but I'm so worried! And I can't do nothing about it!"</p><p><b></b>She could nearly hear the smile her mother wore. <i>"That's only natural, dear. You love him and care for him; that's nothing to be ashamed of. Rather the opposite, my daughter. I wish your father would care as much about me as you do about Kasumi. But now we're coming. We'll arrive as soon as possible."</i></p><p><b></b>"Mom? Please stay put. Washu-chan – that is the scientist that saved Kasumi – is currently working on a way to get you over to us as fast as possible. And believe me she <i>can</i>." Ranma said.</p><p><b></b>She felt a slight tapping on her shoulder and saw that Tenchi obviously wanted to talk to her mother. With a questioning look she complied and handed the cell-phone to him. "Hello Mrs. Saotome? I'm Tenchi Masaki. Yeah, Ranma's childhood-friend and the grandson of Katsuhito. What Ranma said is right. You really <i>should</i> stay put as Washu, our resident scientist will come up with something. Whatever may happen at your home in the next few minutes will probably be very unusual but it will be just us. Probably an additional door will appear somewhere in your home or something like that. Think nothing of it; just expect us and stay put."</p><p><b></b>Silence reigned for a few moments on the other end of the line. Then… <i>"Okay, young man. We will do as you suggested. How soon can we expect these… unusual happenings?"</i></p><p><b></b>Tenchi thought for a moment. "Wait a second there, Mrs. Saotome…" he answered and laid the cell-phone onto the table. "Ryoko please contact Lil' Washu and ask her how far she has come in her problem solving. Knowing her she should have come up with something by now."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko contacted her mother on her usual way and nodded to herself a few moments later. "You were right, Tenchi. She has indeed found a solution."</p><p><b></b>The grandson of Yosho picked the cell-phone up once more. "Mrs. Saotome? You should expect something in the next twenty minutes I'd say. Maybe you should pack some things for the night as I'm sure you might want to stay overnight."</p><p><b></b><i>"That is a good idea, young man. We'll be expecting anything within the next twenty minutes. Could you please give me my daughter?"</i></p><p><b></b>"Of course, Mrs. Saotome. Here." he said and handed Ranma the cell.</p><p><b></b>"Mom?" she asked.</p><p><b></b><i>"Dear, we'll be there soon. I love you, daughter."</i></p><p><b></b>Ranma smiled and wiped away a lone tear at the same time. "I love you too, mom."</p><p><b></b>Both Saotome women said "Bye." at the same time and hung up respectively.</p><p><b></b>The redhead at the Masaki house felt good that she was finally able to express her feelings better. If only it had not asked such a high price…</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Ranma had just hung up when Washu came storming out of her lab. With impatient gestures she waved the four youths into her lab. Without waiting for them she approached one of her doors and entered. Having little choice the four followed like ducklings their mother.</p><p><b></b>They exited the door and reappeared in the newly equipped living area of the lab Washu had created for herself. The diminutive scientist was already sitting on a comfy looking couch, sipping from a cup of tea. A sophisticated looking device was lying on the table.</p><p><b></b>Looking at each other the four sat down. "Is that…" asked Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Washu nodded. "Yup. With that device I'll be able to create one of my doors at the Tendo Dojo. How you ask? Easily. I just applied my genius intellect to the task et voila… it was really easy. I used my cloaked satellite in orbit to locate the Tendo Dojo, placed a subspace marker through an equally cloaked drone I sent via subspace-travel and we had our connection. Oh you ask how I did it? Now that would be too complicated to explain as you'd have to know the working principles of quantum physics to understand it. Which you don't. To put it simple: if I push this button," she pointed to a big red button, "a door to the Tendo Dojo will appear. Thusly." she said and pushed the button.</p><p><b></b>All four watched fascinated and moments later one of Washu's customary doors appeared in the back of the room. Ranma just stomached that and the idea that this door led to the Tendo Dojo, a place that was several hundred miles away. Apparently nearly nothing was impossible for Washu and she'd do her utmost to stay on her good side. "Cool!" she exclaimed and looked appropriately impressed. Fact that obviously pleased little Washu. "It really seems that nothing is impossible for you, Washu-chan. Could I ask you to find a way to put one years worth of training into one day, or maybe a few days? That shouldn't be hard after what you did."</p><p><b></b>The redheaded scientist's eyes lit up at being faced with yet another challenge. "Considering how busy I've been lately I never thought about something like that… but it sounds challenging. Call me back on it in a few days and I just might have a solution." she said and Ranma quickly hid her surprise and nodded. She'd only been joking…</p><p><b></b>"Okay, what are we waiting for?" exclaimed Tenchi. "Let's do it! Else you don't want us there, Ranma…"</p><p><b></b>Ranma just smiled. "You're my friends. All of you. Of course I want you with me in this."</p><p><b></b>The other three smiled and little Washu on her part was very glad for her daughter. It really seemed as if she'd finally found a real friend; even if she was as much a rival. Not for Tenchi but regarding fighting so much more. "I'll stay behind and ensure that everything goes smoothly. Enjoy the ride." she said with a cackle.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi raised a brow at that. "Umm little Washu… this door <i>is</i> like your others, right?"</p><p><b></b>The diminutive redhead pouted. "You're no fun, Tenchi. Always asking me to spoil my own fun. But ookay… yes it is like my other doors. You'll feel nothing different. Just step in here and exit at your destination. Now leave me be." she grumbled.</p><p><b></b>Four teens looked at each other and shrugged. With a last wave at Washu they walked towards the door; Ranma opened it and entered first, the others followed suit. The door closed behind them and no evidence remained that they had been there a few moments ago.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>At a certain Dojo several hundred miles away from Okayama several figures had congregated around a door that had mysteriously appeared right next to the furo door. Nodoka had let Soun in on everything except that love had blossomed between their children and she'd once more been pleasantly surprised that he had not erupted into a torrent of tears at hearing that his oldest child had been injured.</p><p><b></b>Rather his appearance had taken on something steely of which Nodoka did not know the meaning. But it was at least better than having to yell at him for being weak. The two of them had packed some things they'd need and had stashed in into the backpack Soun wore.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki was also gathered at the door as well as Genma. He was at present nursing several lumbs courtesy of Nabiki; the two of them, Nodoka and Nabiki had an excellent understanding and were by now an efficient team when it came to dealing with the him.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka had been very impressed with Nabiki's capabilities and she admired the courage of the girl; for she'd told her very detailed what she had done to her daughter and why. She had also admitted that she'd gone overboard from time to time and that she should have acted differently. Nodoka had just listened and had made herself a picture of Nabiki. She'd been convinced that Nabiki was in the process of changing when she'd told her that she'd given Ranma (or now Ranma) all the excess money she'd earned through her.</p><p><b></b>The middle Tendo daughter had also told her that she'd given up her position as the highschool racketeer and that she'd find other ways to finance the Dojo. Especially now that her father had vowed to teach again. Finally Nodoka had made a decision and had followed the example of her child; she had forgiven Nabiki for what she'd done but had reprimanded her that she'd better stay on the path she'd begun to walk.</p><p><b></b>She'd also admonished her to apologise to Akane and to make up to her what she'd done to her little sister. Nabiki had agreed after some arguing simply out of necessity; she <i>had</i> wronged her sister even if Akane had acted like a spoiled brat and thus it was only just and right to try and undo the damage that had been done. Maybe they could become a family again if the problems got actually worked on instead of just being blamed upon a certain pigtailed youth.</p><p><b></b>That was how Nodoka and Nabiki had come to an understanding and Nodoka had actually hired Nabiki to get as much information on the doings of her husband in the last ten years. Nabiki had complied gladly as she could never refuse a challenge to her abilities as an information seeker. Already her research had uncovered a lot of interesting things; things that had made a certain Nodoka Saotome quite furious and which had resulted in what Nabiki and Akane had dubbed 'Panda bashing'.</p><p><b></b>As for Akane, she had improved constantly under the guidance of Elder Cologne as well as the help of Dr. Jagakawa; it had really helped that the Elder had taught Akane the stuffspace-technique. This way Akane could still reach for a mallet when needed but this one was a lot less dangerous for her and her surroundings. After only two days the Elder had beaten the instinct to use her ki to form a mallet out of her little sister which had also been due to the medication.</p><p><b></b>And a calmer Akane could obviously learn a lot faster than an enraged Akane for it had only taken her two more days after that to master the stuffspace-technique. Everyone had been glad for her; well, not really everyone as Genma was the one who had to suffer the brunt of Akane's malletings. For after Nodoka had had a heart-to-heart talk with Akane and everything had been cleared up she had agreed to help Auntie to reeducate a certain husband of Nodoka Saotome. As Genma still was his usual misogynistic self Akane had all the justification she needed to use her new technique to mallet the stupid panda into LEO. Only if necessary of course, which had been less and less the case as Genma had seemed to learn his lesson.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki and Nodoka shared a look. The vista of the Saotome matriarch said 'be on your guard' and Nabiki nodded. Luckily she too had undergone the training in the stuffspace; it was a technique she had just not been able to resist for it was so damn useful. Indeed she owed the Elder now a favour but she already had a very good plan on how to pay it back. But right now they had to keep Genma in line.</p><p><b></b>It would probably only be minutes now until Ranma arrived. And it would just not do for Genma to learn where she and her sister (or probably brother now) stayed. They deserved their peace and quiet and considering what auntie had told her about the developing relationship between Ranma and her sibling their privacy had to be preserved.</p><p><b></b>Considering Genma's invisibility technique Nodoka and Nabiki were on their guard in case he would try something stupid. After all, should he learn of the location of Ranma's and Kasumi's stay it could not be ruled out that he could be swayed by certain parties in Nerima to spill the beans. Genma was not known for thinking things through and if someone waved enough Yen in his face… that was something that had to be prevented at all costs.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly the new door opened and Nodoka was instantly on her guard in case she needed to keep her husband in line. Nabiki had her new mallet stored in stuff space too, just in case. It was a special model with titanium shaft and lay very good in the hand. It had not been necessary to use it that often in the past weeks seeing as the threat of using it had been enough to keep Genma in line.</p><p><b></b>It seemed he was slowly learning that the teachings of his master regarding women was not the lore and seeing as Happosai had been away for some time now Genma had had some time to think about it. But right now, seeing as Happosai was back from his Europe tour Genma just could not be trusted; thus Nodoka had admonished him to behave.</p><p><b></b>Seeing that Genma was not stupid, just often too greedy for his own good he heeded their advice and waited for his son to arrive while hanging to his own thoughts. He hoped that he would be able to convince his son to remain a man as much as possible. Genma wanted his son back; he did not like to admit it, but he missed Ranma and their spars. The Saotome patriarch only hoped that it was not too late. Hopefully his strong son had not been turned into a weak girl by now…</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Ranma and the others had just stepped through the door as they had already reappeared at the other end, their destination. She had barely exited the door when she was suddenly engulfed in a bonecrushing hug by her mother. "Oh Ranma you are alright! I was so worried when I heard the story!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>The younger redhead on her part was slowly turning blue. "Moom! Mind easing… up some? Gotta… breathe!" she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>The other three newcomers surveyed this with some amusement. Especially Tenchi surveyed Ranma's mother very intently. So that was the apprentice of his grandfather. Yes, she was apparently a formidable woman and had a striking resemblance with her daughter. Using his senses he perceived that she was unusually strong; her power-level was nothing to laugh at, that he recognised even though he had just started training on how to sense auras and power-levels a few months back. Now it was apparent from whom Ranma had gotten her strength and power.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile a somewhat blushing Nodoka had indeed eased up on her child, much to Ranma's relief. "Sorry, daughter. It's just so good to see you even if it's under such unfavourable circumstances."</p><p><b></b>With that Soun came around the corner. He'd wanted to fetch something he'd said he had forgotten. But upon laying eyes on Ranma he erupted into the demon-head. "RANMA! HOW COULD YOU LET MY PRECIOUS BABY GET HURT!"</p><p><b></b>Genma who saw too much of a girl in his son for his taste took the same line. "Yes, boy! You're such a disgrace! Did I bring you up to be a man among men or not? A man would have been able to protect Kasumi! You shame your honourable father! It's all your fault Kasumi got hurt! Why did you have to become such a weak girl? Oh why was I so cursed by the Kami?" Genma exclaimed theatrically.</p><p><b></b>He had not been told the exact circumstances but he knew that Kasumi had gotten injured; and due to the fact that Ranma had accompanied her and failed to protect her it had to be his fault. His fault because he had been in this weak girl-form. Hopefully his speech would bring home the point that Ranma had to become and remain a strong man again.</p><p><b></b>Ranma on her part was unprepared for such an unexpected onslaught. Despite the assurances of the others that it had not been her fault she had not forgiven herself for what had happened and pressed herself into her mother and started to shake. Having seen enough Ryoko intervened on Ranma's behalf. Indeed she was here in the house of someone else but that did not hinder her to teach some truths.</p><p><b></b>With blazing eyes she rounded up on the two men, ready to deal out a severe tongue-lashing. "Have some respect for Ranma! Had it not been for her we all would have been <i>dead</i>! It ain't her fault that your son got hurt! He threw himself inta a blast aimed for Ranma! He wanted ta protect the one he loves most and ya know what? He's a hero for that in my eyes! But don't ya dare blame Red here for this! She has crucified herself for it even if it ain't her fault! It was your sons' decision and with it he saved us all. Ranma here is not ta blame for what he did! The one that is, is destroyed. By Ranma!"</p><p><b></b>Soun visibly deflated at hearing this. As always he had assumed that Ranma was the one to blame and apparently he had been wrong to jump to conclusions. As so often. With a sigh Soun looked at Ranma who was presently being hugged by Nodoka. The Saotome matriarch had reacted instinctively and had soothed her shaking daughter. The redhead had just not expected to be blamed for everything, seeing as everyone at the Masaki household had done the exact opposite.</p><p><b></b>Ranma had by now calmed down somewhat and looked thankfully at Ryoko. The other understood and nodded with a lopsided smile.</p><p><b></b>A certain Genma Saotome however thought to add his own thoughts. "A martial artist has to protect the weak, boy! How do you want to protect the weak if you can't protect yourself? You shame your father. You're nothing more than a weak, worthless girl." he stated.</p><p><b></b>Ranma who had recovered enough to be emotional stable again, seethed. But she did not have to move a single finger to deal out some punishment. With a smirk Ryoko turned around to her. "Let me guess, this is your father, eh, Ranma?" she asked with an undertone, and the redhead nodded. "Mind if I show him <i>my</i> version of reeducation?"</p><p><b></b>By now Ranma smirked evilly. It was a smirk that would have had even the most battle-hardened soldiers running for the hills. "But of course not, Ryoko. Feel free to do whatever you deem necessary. If it's okay with you, mother…"</p><p><b></b>Said Nodoka Saotome looked at her daughter, then at her husband and finally at Ryoko. "Not at all. It seems as if all the progress we thought we had made was for naught. Maybe your oaf of a father will listen if somebody else preaches some truths to him."</p><p><b></b>Ryoko's eyes gleamed as she advanced on Genma. As he knew nothing about Ryoko and seeing that the ex-space pirate did not look that impressive he faced her with a taunting smirk. "And what can a spiky-haired little girl like you do to me?"</p><p><b></b>That was indeed the wrong question to ask as Genma Saotome found out a few moments later. With a snarl Ryoko ignited her energy sword and began to chase a rapidly running Saotome patriarch who had found out just what this 'spiky-haired girl' could do. "Not another mad-woman with a sword!" he exclaimed as he ran out of the house and into the garden.</p><p><b></b>What followed were loud yelps of pain that echoed throughout the compound but seeing as Nabiki had sold sound-proofing to the neighbours a long time ago nobody cared. The others followed Ryoko and Genma out of curiosity and as soon as they entered the garden they saw how Genma slipped into the Umi-sen-ken.</p><p><b></b>Unsurprisingly Ryoko was frustrated but seeing as Ranma was still able to sense his ki due to her improved senses Genma was far from safe. "Ryoko, he is five feet to your left." she said and therewith prevented a sneak attack.</p><p><b></b>With a smirk Ryoko cancelled her sword and fired a large energy-blast at that exact spot and mere moments later a singed Genma became visible. "Betrayed by my own flesh and blood…" he whined.</p><p><b></b>"If you weren't such a woman hating oaf but a father instead things might be different." Ranma countered with a huff.</p><p><b></b>"Yeah!" Ryoko exclaimed. "To say that women are weak is utter bullshit! And now face your punishment like a man!"</p><p><b></b>Genma barely had time to eep before Ryoko gave chase. Her energy-sword formed in her right hand and she began slashing away at the Saotome patriarch. The cyan-haired alien was careful not to do too much damage as she was quite certain that Ranma and her mother would prefer Genma alive even despite his attitude. But that did not mean that she could not put the fear of God into the man.</p><p><b></b>Grinning a slightly demented grin she used her ability of duplication in order to achieve her goal. Everyone except for Tenchi and Ayeka boggled at the display. "I know I haven't had any sake so why am I seeing double?" the Tendo patriarch muttered.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi smiled. "Think nothing of it. That's just one of her powers." he explained.</p><p><b></b>The others nodded, their eyes still the size of dinner-plates; a certain redhead grinned. "I hope she'll use that one against me in our next fight. Now that would be a challenge!" she exclaimed with gleaming eyes.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki shook her head in amusement. "Still the same old Saotome, eh?"</p><p><b></b>The redhead in question blushed a bit and grinned while she watched how one Ryoko sliced at her father while the other floated next to him, taunting him. "Now who's weak, eh? Ya still gonna say that girls are weak even though this girl is whopping yer ass?"</p><p><b></b>Genma's only answer was a yelp of pain as an energy-blast hit him in the butt, setting his pants on fire. Nodoka shook her head at her husbands' antics. "I hope he will learn yet that his concept of female inferiority is baseless. It would be much better for his health." she said with mirth.</p><p><b></b>Her daughter, who was standing right next to her nodded. "Yeah. One would think he'd learned by now, wouldn't one?"</p><p><b></b>The Tendo patriarch sighed. "It was always hard for my old friend to accept new truths. But I'd say that he's on a good way. Alas, if only he'd lose his fear of the master… it would be so much easier then."</p><p><b></b>Tenchi grinned as he watched Ranma's father. "Ryoko should really let him jump into the pond. That's gotta hurt." he said with mirth.</p><p><b></b>The cyan-haired alien had heard the comment due to her sensitive hearing and smirked at him. With a mischievous grin she fired another energy blast at Genma and this one blasted him straight into the koi-pond, extinguishing the fire.</p><p><b></b>A charred panda treaded water, a very relieved expression on his face. Ryoko integrated the double back into her body and floated above him. "I hope that taught ya. Females ain't weak and if ya ever insult women again I'm not gonna be as forgiving. Got me?"</p><p><b></b>The panda could only nod seeing as the alternative was bound to bring more pain. Maybe he should really rethink his opinion of women. It was starting to get detrimental for his health; and besides, a good martial artist knew when to cut his losses. While the panda climbed out of the pond and shook out his fur Ryoko floated over to where the others were standing while Genma-panda trotted behind, grumbling.</p><p><b></b>Soun produced a kettle with hot water from somewhere and returned his old friend to normal. Ryoko walked over to the two older men and looked Genma dead in the eye. "Ranma is anything but a disgrace. She fought against odds that would have had the likes of ya running for the hills. Red here battled something so terribly strong that it could have killed twenty of ya with ease. That Kasumi was hurt is not her fault and it does not make Ranma a weak girl. If anything she is a strong and brave warrior, and it was an honour to fight alongside her. Is that clear now?"</p><p><b></b>"Hear, hear!" exclaimed both Tenchi and Ayeka.</p><p><b></b>Genma on his part sweated outwardly in face of the power and abilities this Ryoko had demonstrated, but inwardly he sighed. It had been hard on him to throw these accusations at his son but he had been convinced that he'd be able to make the boy see the error of his ways. He, Ranma, was a man, his heir, and no girl. Now it seemed as if he had alienated his child in vain, seeing as this spiky-haired woman had countered his words so easily. For now he had to give in, considering the power-level of this girl, but he'd try again later. "Yes." Genma finally said and bowed his head.</p><p><b></b>Ranma smirked at the cyan-haired alien, her smirk conveying the message 'well done'. Ryoko inclined her head and touched down beside Tenchi as soon as she was finished with Genma. That had been fun and practically screamed for a repetition. She looked at the first crown princess of Jurai and the other woman nodded. On an unspoken consent the group went back into the house with a discontented Genma trotting behind them. Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko threw him glances.</p><p><b></b>They did not know overly much about Genma except from what Ranma had told them but her stories seemed to understate the stupidity of her father. Had the idiot no compassion for his daughter? Or at least some sense of tact? Hadn't he seen that Ranma would have needed his support instead of insults? What a stupid woman-hater! And why had he kept on calling Ranma 'boy'? It was obvious by far that Ranma was a girl!</p><p><b></b>Yes, now it made a lot of sense why Ranma and her chosen one had decided to spend some time away from this house. If something like this was normal around here…</p><p><b></b>Soun, being the host led the group into the living room and motioned for everyone to sit down. Ranma, Nabiki, Nodoka and Soun took their usual spots while Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko remained standing. "Now that that is cleared I'd say that introductions are in order." Tenchi said as he stepped forward. "Hello, my name is Tenchi Masaki. And the next time you attack someone verbally or physically make sure to know all the facts, okay?" he said to Soun.</p><p><b></b>The owner of the Tendo Dojo nodded crestfallen and looked at Ranma. "Ranma… I'm sorry for flying off the handle. I'm trying to overcome my old ways but from time to time I fall back into them. Forgive an old fool for his mistakes."</p><p><b></b>As well Ranma as Nodoka smiled; Ranma on her part had been startled by what Soun had accused her of but Nodoka had been furious and had planned to give Soun a good piece of her mind. However both Saotome women were reconciled now.</p><p><b></b>It took a lot of character to admit ones faults and Soun had done so in a very convincing way. "Its okay, Mr. Tendo. I can't fault you as I blamed myself too. I still do to some extent. But he did what he thought he had to do. You know, he's a real hero." she said somewhat dreamily and a lot of meaning was transported in this simple sentence. "Besides, I don't see an old man here. Just someone who has listened to his perverted master and my father for too long." she stated.</p><p><b></b>Soun was surprised at that last statement and it nearly distracted him from the lingering suspicion he had; but he had grown cautious enough not to ask her here and now if what he thought was true. With Genma around it would not be safe and he had promised that he would not pressurise any of the children. "Thank you, Ranma. But who are your other friends?"</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed. "You're welcome, Mr. Tendo. This," she pointed at Ryoko, "is Ryoko. We started off the wrong foot in the beginning but now we're getting along much better." she said while Ryoko smirked and waved.</p><p><b></b>"Seems to be a pattern for you, Ranma." said Nabiki.</p><p><b></b>Ranma blushed and Nodoka looked at Ryoko. "What does my daughter mean by this, Ryoko? It is okay that I call you Ryoko, isn't it?"</p><p><b></b>The ex-space pirate nodded. "We got inta a fight 'cause I thought that she was there ta steal Tenchi away from me. It was not until later that I realised that she didn't wanta… ya know, I gotta horrible past for which most people would reject me, Mrs. Saotome. Your daughter did not and I'm thankful for it. If this baka over there is tryin' ta hurt her any more I'll really hafta hurt <i>him</i>. Badly. Ranma is a warrior, and warriors stand together."</p><p><b></b>Ayeka nodded. "The same goes for me. Not the part with the horrible past, mind you, but I agree with Ryoko. Should your husband try to hurt Ranma in any form <i>he</i> will be hurt. By the way, I'm Ayeka Jurai, half-sister of Katsuhito."</p><p><b></b>The two women exchanged bows and Ranma smiled despite her blush. "See what ya two did? Ya made me blush." she exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>Genma could not stop himself.<b><br/></b>"Stop acting like a weak girl, boy! I raised you to be a man among men, my son, someone to make the Saotome line proud, and not some girl!" he exclaimed only to be bashed over the head.</p><p><b></b>Soon Genma had swirls for eyes and was seeing stars. Yes, it really seemed as if Genma Saotome had a very hard time in overcoming the deeply ingrained conviction that women were inferior. Little did the others know that he did what he did because he was convinced that his son should not be living as a girl if he could try to stay a man as much as possible. Him being both sides of the coin as Nodoka had dubbed it was ridiculous in his opinion. Besides, he just had no idea how to deal with a teenage girl. He wanted his son back!</p><p><b></b>Ignorant of this Ranma needed to vent some steam. Slowly and deliberately she walked over to him until she was standing in front of her somewhat dazed father. "If ya didn't notice, I <i>am</i> a girl right now. And will be fulltime for the next three months. But I'm sure as hell not weak, stupid pops!" she yelled into his ears, effectively giving him one hell of an ear-ache.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi agreed too. "Ranma was my best childhood-friend and Ranma-chan is one of my best friends. Whoever wants to hurt her has to run through me. And just so that anyone has an idea with what he would be dealing with," he said and looked pointedly at the panda who was slowly regaining his wits, "I collapsed a black hole without even trying."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki was the fastest to regain her wits, as usual. "You can't… can't mean the stellar phenomenon, can you?"</p><p><b></b>Tenchi nodded while Ayeka slapped her forehead. "Lord Tenchi, why did you tell them? They're not to know!"</p><p><b></b>The grandson of Katsuhito disagreed. "Ranma's mother is to know. And if he," he pointed at Genma, "spills the beans to anyone no amount of money would be able to hide him." he said and let his Juraian powers come to the fore.</p><p><b></b>Genma was hard pressed not to execute the crouch of the wild tiger there and then. He'd only ever felt that much power around the master or Ranma lately and knew without a doubt that this young man would make his words come true in an instant if he fouled up. Not that he planned to, anyway. "I… understand."</p><p><b></b>Ranma grinned. "Now that would be a first." she exclaimed and voiced the opinion of many. Inwardly she was sad that her father, a man who was a good and strong martial artist in his own right was so easily cowed by people with power.</p><p><b></b>It was really sad how the training under Happosai had made her father into a woman-hating coward. One look at her mother showed her that she shared her opinion. Yet another look and a nod created an understanding that they would try their utmost to exorcise those teachings out of him for good. Even if it would be painful… for him.</p><p><b></b>Meanwhile Ryoko stepped in front of the panda to bring home some points. "If ya ever call Ranma here weak again or belittle women I'm gonna know." she said and created her energy-sword. "Red here has more courage than ya ever gonna have. And I'm proud that I fought alongside her. Ya wouldn't believe how much I'd like ta skin yer alive fer the stunts ya pulled with Red but fer some strange reason Red seems ta love ya. So do yer best that it stays this way…" she trailed off suggestively.</p><p><b></b>Genma on his part just did not understand what in the world he had done wrong. And why was it that sword-wielding women were always on his case? His survival skills kicked in and told him that he should better give in; they had been blunted by disuse but right now his hostility-o-metre was practically screaming at him. So if he did not want to end up as a panda-fur rug he'd better start acting convincingly.</p><p><b></b>What he said then was one of the hardest things ever but for the sake of his survival and continued good health he had to do. There simply were too many angry females with swords here for his taste here. And the power-level of that cyan-haired woman was nothing to laugh at. "I'm sorry, bo… girl. But it's master Happosais fault! He has corrupted me!"</p><p><b></b>Soun slapped his forehead. "Genma, how could you call the master by his name? Have you forgotten what doing so means?"</p><p><b></b>As Genma seemed to realise just that something that seemed to be a two foot tall ball-lightning burst into the Tendo living room, carrying a sack full of female unmentionables. "Has anyone called my name? Oooohhh! Sweeto!" a certain old perverted martial arts grandmaster exclaimed as he noticed the wealth of very attractive females right away.</p><p><b></b>Ranma slapped her forehead. "Happosai. Great! Just what we needed!" she said and was half-tempted to throw her hands up in despair. Why could she never get a break? Massaging her temples she tried to ward of the incoming headache, and her testiness went up several notches.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi and the girls on their parts were taken aback. What in Tsunamis name was that creature? Could that be the perverted grandmaster Ranma had mentioned?</p><p><b></b>As soon as said perverted grandmaster by the name of Happosai laid eyes on Ranma and the other gorgeous females he had the feeling as if he had died and had entered paradise. To be in the presence of so much beauty… "Hey Ranma-chan! Long time no see! My how you have grown! Come and give an old man what he needs, Ranma-chan!" he exclaimed and bolted forward, his sack full of undergarments forgotten.</p><p><b></b>However Ranma blocked him with ease and kicked him against the far wall with a snarl that once again sounded too female for Genma's ears. The blow did not faze the old lecher as he ricocheted from the wall and came now straight at Ryoko. The ex-space pirate was too dumbfounded to do anything and thus the perverted grandmaster had a walk over. Before Ryoko could blink Happosai was nestled in her bosom and began fondling her ample talents. "Mmmmh… not as big as Ranma-chans but they'll do!"</p><p><b></b>That shook Ryoko out of her stupor and her temper surged with the force of a nuclear explosion. "YOU!" she shrieked in righteous female outrage and lunged for the tiny pervert who bounced away from her breasts; however the old lecher was not the grandmaster of Anything Goes for nothing and evaded her lunge with ease.</p><p><b></b>The energy he had gotten through the fondling allowed him to add even more speed to his movements and the others watched while Ryoko used her energy-sword to slash at the bouncing pervert. But seeing that her speed could not compare to that of Happosai the old master grew quickly tired of that and aimed for a new target.</p><p><b></b>And once more sooner than (nearly) anyone could blink Happosai was nestled between Ayeka's breasts and gave them a good feel-over. "Hmm, not as big but certainly very round and firm! Yes, give an old man what he needs!"</p><p><b></b>This time Ayeka cried out in indignation and Ryoko did not even think to laugh at her rivals' plight. What that creature had done to her and now to Ayeka was an outrage! Ranma on her part had stood there and watched how her students were handling the situation. It looked indeed as if they'd have to go a long way regarding speed.</p><p><b></b>She continued to watch as Ayeka chased the old lech through the hallway but as expected Happosai stayed miles ahead of her and was laughing the whole time. "HOW DARE YOU MOLEST THE FIRST CROWN PRINCESS OF JURAI! DIE!" Ayeka yelled and fired an energy blast at Happosai.</p><p><b></b>The old grandmaster looked at it with interest, sidestepped effortlessly and watched how the blast scorched the wall. Nodoka stepped forward with her katana drawn. "Master Happosai that will be enough. These ladies are guests of my daughter and are to be treated with respect." she said in a commanding tone of voice.</p><p><b></b>And it nearly worked but when Happosai looked at Ayeka his eyes gleamed. "But I never fondled a princess before! Sweeto!" he cried out and jumped at her once more, this time intent on liberating the silky darlings she was surely wearing.</p><p><b></b>Ayeka was seething mad and readied another energy blast when Ranma decided to intervene. She gave Tenchi, who had wanted to join in a shake of her head. Both Ayeka and Ryoko caught this too and both women were feeling warm all over at the thought that Tenchi had wanted to defend or rather re-establish their honour.</p><p><b></b>Suddenly Ranma just seemed to reappear in front of Ayeka and the nearing Happosai was too slow to react. Her right hook caught him full force and sent him through the roof. Ranma looked sheepishly at Nabiki. "Sorry 'bout that."</p><p><b></b>Nabiki waved it away. "I'll put it on his tab, Red." she said with a smirk.</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded and walked to the outside, well knowing that the fight was not over. But it seemed as if someone else had adapted her nick. <b>'Hmm,'</b> she thought with a smirk, <b>'two can play this game.' </b>"You do that, Nabs. Now I'm gonna take care of the old lech. He's probably gonna be fuming mad."</p><p><b></b>To say that the middle Tendo daughter was surprised at that retort would have been an understatement. It really seemed as if Ranma, no, Ranma had indeed made some progress in the weeks she had been away. "Sure." was the only thing she managed to reply.</p><p><b></b>Needless to say that everyone followed Ranma to the outside. As expected, Happosai was already waiting for her and he had a welcome surprise. "Happo Daikarin!" he yelled and threw four of his Burning Fire Blasts at Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Ranma countered lightning fast and batted all four Daikarin back at their originator. "Oops!" was all Happosai could exclaim before they went off in his face.</p><p><b></b>However that was by far not enough to take Happosai out and Ranma knew that. Moments later a slightly charred Happosai flared his battle-aura and Genma cowered in the corner. Soun on his part was inwardly terrified too but he would not cower before the master any longer and stood his ground.</p><p><b></b>Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko on their parts watched with anticipation. From Ranma's narration they knew that this was the perverted Grandmaster of the style Ranma had learned in and it would be interesting to see how this fight would go.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka and Nabiki were both hoping that the redhead would give the old pervert a good dressing down so that Genma would finally see that women were not weak. If she beat Happosai how could Genma claim that Ranma was weak?</p><p><b></b>The redheaded Saotome girl on her part grinned at the old pervert. "So ya wanna play rough, eh, old lech? <i>Good</i>." she said and raised her own battle-aura. Gradually she let her new powers come to the fore and they intermixed with her ki once more; once her battle-aura was fully raised it melted the underground again.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki on her part just shrugged. That was nothing a good gardener would not be able to remedy and for the facial expression the old lech wore right now she had to admit that it was all worthwhile. Acting fast she pulled her camera out of her stuffspace and began snapping away.</p><p><b></b>-.-</p><p><b></b>Happosai on his part was very much surprised at the power Ranma-chan exuded. It was quite a lot more than he remembered and might probably be enough for the redhead to achieve a decisive victory over him. Before their fights had never had a real winner as he had never gone all out but it seemed as if he had to do so now. Something had changed in Ranma-chan but he could not lay a finger on it. Anyway, now it was time to rumble!</p><p><b></b>Faster than he thought the redhead could follow he shot forwards. The ki-energy he had absorbed from the two pretty ladies came in handy now as it had strengthened him considerably. However imagine Happosai's surprise as Ranma's right arm suddenly shot forward and her fist connected painfully with his tiny face.</p><p><b></b>The old pervert was sent flying and left a deep indention in the wall that surrounded the Tendo compound. Moments later the old man got out of the man-shaped indention and a hard glint appeared in his eyes. From then on the battle was joined in earnest and attacks were traded back and forth at a level that most human beings would consider super-human. Everything the Musabetsu Kakuto Ryu had to offer was employed and taken to heights thusly never seen before.</p><p><b></b>Happosai tried to distract Ranma with a ki-powered punch to her right side that should serve to distract her so that he could use some pressure points to mould the battle in his favour. Yet Ranma surprised him once more as she blocked that attempt with ease. That was the moment when Happosai realised that Ranma was at least his equal regarding speed. He had to admit that he was impressed; Ranma had always been very talented but it seemed that she had now gained the power to match up to his skills. But he still had some aces up his sleeve and several centuries of experience playing for him.</p><p><b></b>The old master lashed out without warning and the redhead was not prepared to block the follow-up attack that followed that feint-attack and the pipe the old grandmaster used on her at short range blasted her into the wall. Compared to what the Android had done to her it was nothing but it served to make her angry. Peeling herself out of the wall she flared her fiery aura, fire blazing in her eyes, her hair weaving in an unseen breeze.</p><p><b></b>"Damn! Now Red looks really pissed off!" Ryoko stated.</p><p><b></b>"No shit, Sherlock." Nabiki said and the cyan-haired woman surveyed her for a moment before shrugging and concentrating on the battle.</p><p><b></b>Ranma scolded herself for a brief moment for having let her guard down and vowed that such a thing would not happen again. All that power she wielded now was making her too confident and the hit Happosai had scored reminded her that power was no guarantee for victory. Only constant vigilance added to power could achieve that.</p><p><b></b>Grinding her teeth so hard that she could have crushed diamonds the redhead tensed her muscles and suddenly shot forward. Due to the fiery aura that surrounded her she looked like a fiery streak and soon the tiny pervert needed all of his power and experience to block the blows that kept coming in mercilessly.</p><p><b></b>Using his Happo-Daikarin to create a diversion the old man leapt back several feet. He knew that using his pipe again was out of the question as Ranma-chan would expect this of him. Hmm, it seemed as if he'd have to dig into his bag of tricks. Now it was time to demonstrate why he was the grandmaster and Ranma a pupil.</p><p><b></b>Making sure that he would not endanger the others he readied his next move. He might have been a man with a somewhat unusual hobby and lose morals but that did not mean that he would voluntarily hurt bystanders. Little did the old lech know that as well Tenchi as Ayeka could have blocked just about anything he could dish out with their shields.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was now waiting for the next move of her 'master' but she was not really prepared for what he did next. Happosai demonstrated impressively that <i>he</i> had obviously been the one to have originated the vacuum blades for from one moment to the next at least three dozen of those were on their way to Ranma.</p><p><b></b>Happosai had gauged the energy of the blades thusly so that they would not kill Ranma. After all, killing such a cute girl with such an ample bosom would be too great a loss. And besides once he had cowed her sufficiently she'd finally be able to become his heir and he'd mould her as he wanted her to be. "Now bow to the greater experience and wisdom of your master, Ranma-chan and I might make you my true heir. After some extensive show of your respect for your master, of course. I have just the set of panties and bra in mind…" he said dreamily and pulled a set of lacy and skimpy black panties and bra out of nowhere.</p><p><b></b>The redhead however had enough from playing by the rules of others; she was fed up that others thought they could plan out her life for her and steer it like they wanted. This was <i>her</i> life and she had finally begun to take control over it. No old pervert would make her bow to his wishes! And for <i>him</i> she'd never wear sexy underwear! "Ya ain't my master! And I ain't never gonna bow ta ya!" she exclaimed and began dodging and weaving around the blades at a speed that even Happosai would not have been able to match.</p><p><b></b>Fact that did not go unnoticed by the old perverted master. Soun on his part watched with pride how the son-turned-daughter of his old friend Genma thwarted one of the most dreaded attacks of the master. His version of the vacuum blades, the original one from which Genma had derived his version was much stronger and faster than that of his old friend; yet Ranma, no Ranma, dodged these blades as if they were flying in slow-motion.</p><p><b></b>The old pervert had noticed that too and just began to ready another bout of even stronger and faster vacuum blades when he suddenly felt the impact of a fist in his face. The next thing the others saw was a battered old man who had been deeply indented into the wall surrounding the Tendo compound once more. "Ouch!" was his comment as he extracted himself from the wall.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka's eyes gleamed as she saw what her daughter was capable of. She was so strong and honourable! Oh what a great bunch of grandchildren she would give her! Nabiki on her part noticed that Nodoka was spacing off into regions unknown and she did the only thing that brought Nodoka out of it any time: a good jolt.</p><p><b></b>As usual Nodoka returned to reality instantly and just accurately timed to see the old lech shoot forward straight at her daughter. Instantly blows were traded between the two but with two Flaming Orbs fired in quick succession and at point blank to boot Ranma soon got the upper hand over the surprised master.</p><p><b></b>Happosai had used up a lot of energy to shield himself from the enhanced ki-blasts and that had left him with severely depleted ki-reserves as he had just underestimated the sheer strength of the energy blasts. The old pervert had mistakenly believed that the energy blasts would not be much stronger than the standard Moko Takabisha but he had been dead wrong how he had found out to late. He had found out just how much Ranma's powers had grown but he had paid a high price for it.</p><p><b></b>Now he was just about defenceless and he was unable to block yet another blow that sent him yet again into the wall, barely conscious. Ayeka and Ryoko grinned at each other how Ranma had managed to re-establish their honour and everyone else was proud of Ranma and voiced it; even Genma was among them and the bald martial artist was inwardly nearly ecstatic that his <i>son</i> could hold his own against the master.</p><p><b></b>Tears of joy nearly threatened to escape him at the thought that their plight under the masters' reign of terror might finally be over. All that had to be done was to convince his child to fight the master in a challenge fight and everything would be better than ever before; considering Ranma's prowess a victory was nearly assured! And all that had to be done to reach this goal was to convince his son to <i>stay</i> his son as much as possible. And that would require some careful scheming.</p><p><b></b>The eventual target of said scheming was quite satisfied with herself but that satisfaction only lasted for a few moments as yet another nuisance landed within the perimeter of the Tendo compound. Ranma could only shake her head in resignation. Why were the Kami getting their kicks out of complicating her life?</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group. I enjoy reading your comments, and the suggestions you all make will help to make this story even better.</p><p>If you find anything illogical that might have created a plot-hole or anything else that is wrong, let me know and I'll fix it.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
