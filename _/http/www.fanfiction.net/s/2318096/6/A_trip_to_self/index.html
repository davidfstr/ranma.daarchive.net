</div><p><b>Title</b>: A trip to self</p><p><b>Author name</b>: Trugeta</p><p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by Rumiko Takahashi and VIZ as well as many others. No money is being made and no copyright or trademark infringement is intended. Note further that I don't own any of the trademarks mentioned in this story. So suing is senseless.</p><p>This story focuses on Ranma and Kasumi and is set after Volume 38 of the Manga. It's an AU and Reviews are welcome and appreciated.</p><p><b>Chapter 6: How do we get them used to their curses? </b></p><p><b></b>The Tendos except for Akane, who was still banished to her room until further notice, Saotomes and the Amazons were sitting in the living room and discussing what could be done about the curses and how Ranma and Kasumi could come to terms with them, when Ranma suddenly remembered something.</p><p><b></b>He (as he had returned to male form) slapped his head. "D'oh! I forgot that I promised to call Ryoga if there were any news regarding the Nannichuan or other cures. I'd say what happened qualifies. I'll go and call him."</p><p><b></b>Thus he went into the hall and pulled the card Ryoga had given him out of his wallet, which he kept in his personal stuff space to keep it safe from the panda. He then grabbed the telephone and dialled the number. Seconds later Akari answered. <i>"Hi, this is Akari."</i></p><p><b></b>"Hi Akari, here is Ranma. Is Ryoga nearby?" he asked.</p><p><b></b><i>"Oh, hello Ranma. Yes, Ryoga is on the sofa. I'll go and bring him the phone. If I'd call him to get the phone he might get lost."</i> Akari said only half in jest.</p><p><b></b>Ranma barely suppressed a snicker. Seconds later Akari said <i>"Bye"</i> and Ryoga answered. <i>"Hello, Ranma. I take you got news, what with that the month is over."</i></p><p><b></b>The Saotome youth nodded to himself. Oh yeah, and what news those were. Slowly he began to relate all that had happened, and the lost boy grew progressively more silent during the talk. Then... <i>"AKANE DID WHAT?"</i></p><p><b></b>Ranma winced. "Ouch, my poor ears. But you heard right. She malletted me for absolutely no reason, insulted my mother and was jointly responsible in cursing Kasumi. As a result, the engagement between Akane and me is off. Mr. Tendo has her grounded until the cows come home, as he said."</p><p><b></b>Ryoga snorted. <i>"I can't believe it. And to think that I loved her... oops. I did say that out loud, eh?"</i></p><p><b></b>Now it was Ranma's turn to snort. "Don't matter to me any more. You and me both loved her, but in the end she showed that she is apparently not able to love a man like a normal woman would. I overheard a talk between Kasumi and Nabiki, and what Kuno did to her with his Hentai Horde and the morning fights has apparently left deep scars. Because of that she is simply loathing all boys in general, and that's why she did not trust me at all. She thinks that all boys are perverts that have to be punished if they so much as look at her. Her actions of the past months really convinced me that she needs help, Ryoga. What she'd need was a good shrink. But I'm so sorry for Kasumi. She got caught in the crossfire, and she, especially <i>she</i>, did not deserve it." he said with conviction.</p><p><b></b>The lost boy, not born yesterday, noticed the emotion and obvious care in Ranma's voice, but unlike in former times, refrained to comment on that. <i>"Nobody deserves to be cursed. <b>Nobody</b>. But you're right, Akane should see a shrink. After I came together with Akari I only realised how short-tempered she really is. But alas."</i> he said in the breast-note of confirmedness. <i>"Any news what with a cure, Ranma?"</i> he then asked.</p><p><b></b>Ranma sighed. Then he related what Cologne had said, and also told him what she had said about Pantyhose Taro and how the curses would mix. He also related that there was no cure.</p><p><b></b>Needless to say that Ryoga was quite put out. He was glad that he had Akari, else he would have been very depressed now... <i>"Damn."</i> he said. <i>"Do you <b>believe</b> her, Ranma?"</i></p><p><b></b>The pigtailed martial artist sighed even deeper. "She has no reason to lie, Ryoga. If she had a cure or would even know of a cure, she would have baited me with it and trapped me in marriage to Shampoo. Add to it that the Amazons have lived at Jusenkyo for millennia. If there was a cure, they'd know. No, I believe her. And I have come to realise that I gotta hafta accept the curse."</p><p><b></b>Silence at the other end of the line. What! Ranma accepting the curse? Was that the same Ranma who had always been so adamant about his manhood and who had always braged how manly he was? <i>"Umm, Ranma, that does not sound like you."</i></p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded solemnly, though Ryoga couldn't see it. "I know, Ryoga. But even my mother, my mother of all people, has accepted the curse. Said something about Fate and destiny and me taking control of my life or some stuff, and that now, that I had the curse for the rest of my life I should accept it. And I will try, despite the upbringing baka oyaji gave me. I have long since realised that it is bullcrap that girls are weak and stupid. Hell, I'm not weak as a girl, and Ukyo, Shampoo 'n Kasumi are sure as hell not. If they can live as girls, I can sure as hell do it half the time."</p><p><b></b>Ryoga, invisible to Ranma, nodded. <i>"Tell ya what, buddy. It is high time you accepted the curse. You know, it is much better to turn into a girl than into a helpless animal. At least you have two hands and can still talk. Not to mention that you're not in danger of being eaten, like your idiot of a father tried to do with me. Give him a good trashing from me for that, as I never really got to 'thank' the stupid Panda for what he did. But you have my respect. I know parts of how your idiot of a father brought you up, and all I can tell ya is that: forget all he has taught you outside martial arts. He might be a passable instructor, the Neko-ken notwithstanding, but he is the lousiest parent I have ever seen. Don't listen to him. Girls are not weak and stupid, and it is no shame to turn into one. That I always taunted you with it only served to make you angry, and it worked. Ranma, rather see it as a chance to see both sides of the coin and learn from it. See it as a challenge!"</i></p><p><b></b>"Thanks once more, buddy." Ranma said. Unbeknownst to Ryoga the Heituenniichuan cursed martial artist had pushed the exactly right buttons when he had labelled it a challenge.</p><p><b></b><i>"You're welcome."</i> Ryoga answered. <i>"Hmm, so it seems that I will turn into a pig for the rest of my life, huh?"</i> the lost boy mused. <i>"Not that Akari would mind."</i> he added as an afterthought.</p><p><b></b>"Yeah," Ranma said, "else we find some Nannichuan water. Think about it, even if the curses would mix, it would be better than now. You would still be able to turn back into a man, but your cursed form would be a mix of a human and a pig. I know, I know," he relented, "ya'd probably look like an Oni, but wouldn't it be better than now?"</p><p><b></b>Ryoga thought for a few seconds. <i>"Maybe you're right, Ranma. If you ever find Nannichuan water again, don't let it be destroyed by Akane and Shampoo and think of me."</i> he said only half in jest.</p><p><b></b>"I will." Ranma promised. "Maybe I'll find another way, though. I still have the impression that I have forgotten something important. Maybe it will come back. Gotta say bye now, Ryoga. I wanna see what the others have come up with."</p><p><b></b><i>"Alright, Ranma. Say hi to the others from me. Talk to you later."</i>¹</p><p><b></b>Both martial artists hung up, and Ranma made his way back to the sitting room.</p><p><b>A few minutes earlier... </b></p><p><b></b>"It is clear that my child is not entirely comfortable with his other form, although Ranma has had the curse for a long time now. There must be a way that would make Ranma get used to his female form." Nodoka mused.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded. "I agree, Saotome-san. It would be most advantageous if son-in-law would stay in female form for a longer period of time. If he constantly changed forms it would be most counterproductive for the process of acceptance of his female half." Cologne mused. After a brief pause she continued. "Tendo Kasumi, it would be the best if you did the same. Cold water is a lot more common than hot water, and you need the training in your cursed form."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded. "I hate to say it, Kasumi, but Cologne-san is right. You must train how to be a man, as you too will have the curse for the rest of your life. My child is a bit better situated than you, as Ranma in his female form might pass as a tomboy, but the public would frown greatly on a feminine acting man. The best would be if the both of you would teach the other how to be a man respective a woman. I know it is hard on you, but it is something that needs to be done."</p><p><b></b>Kasumi sighed. She knew that Auntie Saotome was right, and maybe something good would come out of it. After all, it sounded like she would spend a lot of time in Ranma's presence. And if she had read Ranma right, the attraction she felt towards the pigtailed martial artist might be mutual.</p><p><b></b>It had felt so good to be hugged by Ranma in both forms, and the sensations that had run through both her forms had been indescribable. It had been as if a million butterflies had stopped by in her stomach. A truly wonderful feeling.</p><p><b></b>The oldest Tendo daughter had not noticed how her eyes had glazed over for a moment, but Nodoka had. And the Saotome matriarch came to the right conclusions. Yes, a mutual learning experience for Ranma and Kasumi could certainly have... benefits.</p><p><b></b>Shaking herself out of her musings Kasumi answered. "You are right, Auntie. And I could not imagine someone better suited to teach me how to be a man than Ranma. He is always such a gentleman, regardless of the form." the oldest Tendo daughter nearly gushed.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded to herself. She <i>had </i>read the signs correctly. Well, the more important became the task to make Ranma an ally of the tribe. The Amazon matriarch was quite sure now that Kasumi Tendo had fallen for Ranma, and to her it was quite obvious that Ranma would fall for the eldest Tendo daughter too. After all, Tendo Kasumi was easily likeable, treated Ranma well and did not obsess about him or treat him like a possession.</p><p><b></b>That had been one of her most grievous errors in dealing with the young Saotome. In the beginning she had seen him as a mere male and had let her great-granddaughter treat Ranma as a possession to be fought over.</p><p><b></b>Too late had she realised that Ranma Saotome was not a mere anything, as his stunning progress concerning his martial arts skills and power proved impressively.</p><p><b></b>When she had first arrived in Nerima, it had been child's play for her to beat Ranma. Now, nearly one year later, she doubted that she'd be able to beat Ranma even with the aid of the whole council. Not after the stunning display of power Ranma had given today.</p><p><b></b>Saffron had been outrageously strong, and the Amazons had known of his strength and power from legends. Xian-Pu and Mu-Tzu had been eye-witnesses of Saffron's power and had described it, and Mu-Tzu had described Ranma as maybeeven stronger, now.</p><p><b></b>She was sure that Mu-Tzu did not exaggerate. If anything, he'd try to drag Ranma's skill and power through the dirt. No, the boy's reaction had been authentic.</p><p><b></b>The Amazon tribe knew that they would not have stood a chance against Saffron should he have attacked. Now, Ranma had somehow become as strong or even stronger than the godling, and she had realised far too late that they should have treated Ranma as an ally and friend from day one. Maybe, just maybe, love for her Xian-Pu might have grown from this.</p><p><b></b>As it was now, after all the dirty tricks they had used, Cologne doubted that Xian-Pu would have a chance to win Ranma's love at all. In secret she'd prepare everything to make Ranma an ally of the tribe, and as the Leader of the council of the Joketsuzoku she'd give the assignation to follow through with that. An ally with a power that rivalled that of a godling was better than an ex-son-in-law with no ties to the tribe.</p><p><b></b>Now she would do everything in her might to ensure that Ranma and Kasumi got all the help they needed in dealing with their curses. After all, a Ranma who had accepted his female half would be – more easily – accepted by the tribe. But the hardest task would be to break the news to Xian-Pu, when her decision would become official.</p><p><b></b>Shaking herself out of her musings the three-hundred years old Matriach of the Chinese Amazons listened in on the developing conversation between Nodoka and Kasumi.</p><p><b></b>The matriarch admired how the Saotome matriarch was subtly questioning Kasumi, while at the same time reassuring her that everything would be alright. Cologne nodded to herself. Except for her great-granddaughter, Kasumi and Ranma everyone had noticed how the sparks sprayed between the Saotome youth and the newly cursed Tendo.</p><p><b></b>Elder Cologne was raised from her musings when she noticed that Nodoka Saotome was looking at her. "Yes, Saotome-san?"</p><p><b></b>"I was wondering if I could have a word with you, Cologne-san." the Saotome matriarch said, and Cologne noticed clearly that the younger woman was respectful while she displayed strength at the same time. Now she had no doubt any more after whom Ranma took.</p><p><b></b>"Of course, Saotome-san." the Elder said and got up with the help of her staff.</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch got up herself and led the way to the kitchen, while Kasumi busied herself with a talk with Nabiki. As soon as Nodoka and Cologne had entered the kitchen, Nodoka closed the door. "Elder Cologne," she began, "what I wanted to have definite knowledge about, for the sake of my child as well as that of Kasumi, is the following: is a gender-cursed individual able to act on the biological potential of the body? Could Ranma as my daughter end up pregnant?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Cologne needed all of her will-power to not fall off of her staff. Yes, it seemed indeed like a very good idea to dissolve the kisses made by Xian-Pu. It might be pure worry on the part of the Saotome matriarch that her child might end up raped, but somehow the Elder doubted this.</p><p><b></b>She knew that she could trust her instincts, and in the past months she had come to know Saotome Nodoka as someone who would love to become a grandmother. And now that she did not hold Ranma to that archaic and barbaric manliness crap any more she would not put it past her to accept grandchildren even if Ranma were to be the mother.</p><p><b></b>Pushing these thoughts away as unfounded assumptions on her part Elder Cologne prepared to answer. "In the past our tribe has made many experiences with victims of the Nannichuan and the Nyannichuan. You surely know that my tribe is a matriarchal society in which the males play an inferior role. And due to this inferior role of the males in my village many male Amazons have given up their manhood using the Nyannichuan Spring over time, and thus they became Amazon warriors in the process. As you might know there are ways to lock a cursed individual in their cursed form, and those who chose this path had themselves locked and became full Amazon warriors in the process."</p><p><b></b>"But isn't this cruel? I understand your way of living and respect it, but if it forces young men to become women… this can't be right." Nodoka Saotome stated.</p><p><b></b>The Elder smiled sadly. "I understand your position, Saotome-san. But if you want to achieve something in my tribe, and may it even be the most simplest of successes, you have to be female. And those who changed themselves into half-women and who had themselves locked as women have acted of their own free will when they jumped into the Nyannichuan Spring. But you are correct, they were pressured to some extent by our matriarchal society. This is indeed a flaw in the system, but for the sake of the greater good we have to hazard the consequences. For those who changed themselves into women often became some of our greatest warriors in history. Of course I know that it destabilises the population of the village, as males are needed, and nowadays it is only due to my legislation that males are allowed to act as support during battles, giving them more worth than in former times. But I digress. Your question was if a cursed individual can use the full biological potential of the cursed body, meaning, if the cursed body is fully functional, correct?"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka Saotome nodded. "Yes, Elder. And though I can't approve of what your way of living does to the males of your society, I am not the one to judge. This is your way of living, and who am I to tell you how you have to live?" she asked with a smile.</p><p><b></b>Cologne's respect for Ranma's mother grew. Obviously Ranma had also inherited his/her intelligence (so he/she used it) from the maternal side. Too bad that Ranma had had to grow up with nothing but the male fool Genma Saotome as a role model. Shaking herself out of these thoughts the Elder answered, "I appreciate your understanding, Saotome-san. But now to answer your question. We from the Joketsuzoku know from experience that the cursed body is fully functional. A lot of the males who became women of their own free will became mothers throughout history, so yes, the cursed body has the full biological potential."</p><p><b></b>The Saotome matriarch nodded slowly. She did not know what she should do with this knowledge, as she could at the present time not imagine her son-turned-daughter ending up pregnant. But she'd have to warn her child of the potential danger, and if she'd read the signs correctly, and she was sure that she had, then there was more than just a chance that Ranma and Kasumi liked each other, and that, as had been obvious, in more than just their birthforms. She'd have to find out for sure if her husband had exercised his fatherly duties and reconnoitred their child.</p><p><b></b>Gathering her bearings she nodded towards Cologne with a slight smile. "Thank you, Elder. This was most informative and helpful."</p><p><b></b>The matriarch of the Joketsuzoku nodded. "You're welcome." she said, not really knowing what Saotome Nodoka would do with this knowledge. This woman was as unpredictable in her behaviour as son-in… Ranma in a battle.</p><p><b></b>A curious gleam entered Nodoka's eyes, and the Elder sensed that another question was coming her way. That was apparently another trait Ranma had inherited from his/her mother. An insatiable curiosity. "Elder, I'd further like to know if Kasumi will now, that she has the curse, be able to have children in her birthform."</p><p><b></b>Cologne hid her thoughts, which circled around the suspicion that Saotome Nodoka did not only ask out of worry for Kasumi, very well. "You can rest assured, Saotome-san, that Tendo Kasumi will be able to have children in both forms should she desire so. As I explained, the cursed body of a victim of a genderging curse is fully functional, so it would allow Tendo Kasumi to father children should he wish this."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka Saotome nodded. "Thank you, Elder. I am sure it will relieve Soun that his child will still be able to become a mother. You have my gratitude for removing our worries." she said with a small smile and a polite bow.</p><p><b></b>Out of respect for the Saotome matriarch Elder Cologne bowed back. "It was this ones pleasure, Saotome-san."</p><p><b></b>Together the women exited the kitchen and found Nabiki and Kasumi still talking. The males except Mousse had retreated to the Shogi board to waste their time. The myopic Amazon boy was sitting on a chair and smiled adoringly at Shampoo at present; well, in reality the Amazon boy, who was, as so often, too vain to wear his glasses and had apparently pocketed them once more, was smiling adoringly at Soun Tendo, who was fighting the urge to run.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo was still sitting on her chair, looking bored. That changed however when Ranma re-entered the sitting  she was back to full alert and stared adoringly at Ranma. The same could be said about Kasumi, although the Tendo daughter was less obvious. <b>'Great Aphrodite, this will be hard on Xian-Pu. But there is no alternative.'</b> the Matriarch thought.</p><p><b></b>Ranma, oblivious to that, threw himself into the chair next to Kasumi. "Ryoga knows. Didn't take the part what with no cures well, but he didn't blew anythin´ up. He was very surprised at what Akane did, but didn't accuse it to be my fault or nothin´. Lost boy has really grown up."</p><p><b>'As have you, Ranma.'</b> Kasumi thought. She was really proud of Ranma. How much he had improved during the last three months!</p><p><b></b>She still saw his excitement before her minds eye when he had told her that he had stopped insulting people and that it slowly but steadily worked in his favour. The most obvious success was Ryoga, and Kasumi was proud that Ranma was approaching something akin to friendship with the lost boy.</p><p><b></b>But Kasumi remembered with sadness, how Ranma had tried time and time again to be nicer to Akane. And he <i>had</i> been nicer, very much so, that could not be denied. He had stopped insulting her completely, but regardless, Akane had never reacted well.</p><p><b></b>Sometimes she asked herself if it would have worked out if the fathers had ordered Akane to be nicer to Ranma too. After all, something where only one side did everything to ensure success was doomed to fail.</p><p><b></b>But even if the fathers would have done so, Kasumi highly doubted that Akane would have played to the rules. And father had been much too soft with her in the past. Up until the incident with Nodoka father had been wax in Akanes´ fingers.</p><p><b></b>Then there was her temper and her uncanny ability to jump to conclusions which were to 99 wrong.<br/>It was quite clear that Akane was out of control and she needed to convince her father that her youngest sister needed professional help. Badly.</p><p><b></b>Now that she had said down again Nodoka looked at her son. "Ranma, I'm nowconvinced that you'll have to spend as much time in your female form as possible if you ever want to get used to your curse. The same applies for Kasumi and her curse, only in reverse."</p><p><b></b>Ranma gulped. He had expected something like that, but coming from his mother, he could accept it. For his mother he'd still do everything, and if it helped Kasumi, well, the better. "Mom, but what about getting accidentally splashed with warm water? Remember when I pretended to be Ranko Tendo and the hot water pipe in the kitchen burst? Or the bout with the hot water geyser that shot you into the air? I nearly died of cardiac arrest then!"</p><p><b></b>Oh yes, Nodoka remembered that all too vividly. "I know, Ranma. Elder Cologne has several proposals to make in that regard. If you would, Elder."</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded. "Son-in-law, as you well know, cold water is prevalent wherever you go. Usually the curse tries to force you into your cursed form, but if you stay in this form too long the curse will force you back into your uncursed form. We from the Joketsuzoku believe that the Jusenkyo curses were originally meant as punishment. It can't be a coincidence that a cursed victim gets splashed by warm water even if he or she stays in cursed form. I believe the curse was meant to break those who would not accept their Jusenkyo curse, and it succeeded many, many times. But I digress. Son-in-law, there are several possibilities for you to remain in your cursed form. As you well know it is possible to lock a cursed individual in his or her cursed form."</p><p><b></b>Ranma could only nod vigorously. Those had been some of the worst moments of his life. "Oh yes, I know."</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded. She still regretted that she had used the Cats Tongue on Ranma. If she could go back and change one thing, she would change that one moment. How foolish she had been. But that was in the past, although it still haunted her. "However, this is not possible with a cursed individual's normal form. The magic of the curse does not work this way. The old waterproof soap was of some help in that regard, but as you well know, it wore off too quickly."</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed youth nodded. He had pricked up his ears when Cologne had said 'old waterproof soap'. "Elder, you said 'old waterproof soap'. Does that mean they have made a new one?"</p><p><b></b>Cologne cackled. "I see you're as sharp as always, son-in-law." The Elder nodded, "Yes, a new generation of waterproof soap was created by Jusenkyo Products before the happenings of Jusendo. This waterproof soap, however, has a different working principle than the old. You know that you could stay in your normal form without fear of changing into your cursed form for a given type with the original soap."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded. Lathering up with this stuff granted the wearer temporary immunity to the curse. "Yup, only too bad that it wore off so fast."</p><p><b></b>The Elder nodded. "Regarding the normal form you are right. But apparently it was far easier to develop a waterproof soap that freezes the cursed individual in his or her cursed form. The new soap is designed to latch onto the magic of the curse and strengthens it to the point where the curse will lock. Only temporary, of course. This new brand of Jusenkyo products was especially developed for victims of the Nannichuan and Nyannichuan, to make them get used to their curses."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka's eyes shone. That sounded ideal! "And how long does this 'lock' on the curse last?" she asked interested.</p><p><b></b>Genma on the other hand was furious. He had jumped up from the Shogi board, knocking it over in the process, and was gesticulating wildly. "My son will not be locked as a weak, worthless girl!"</p><p><b></b>Even Nabiki, who has busied herself reading the latest new regarding the stock-market, looked up with a grin of anticipation. She did not have to wait long. This time it was not Ranma who had reached the end of patience, but Nodoka. And said Saotome matriarch looked her misogynistic husband dead in the eye as she unsheathed her katana.</p><p><b></b>SHING. This simple sound managed to calm the raging fury of the present females (and one part-time female) immensely. It did however nothing to calm a certain Panda, but that was, to be honest, never the intention. "Dearest, I thought we had established this point. Do we need to go over it again?" she asked and held the katana to Genma's neck.</p><p><b></b>"Urgh!" was Genma's intelligible reply. "No... no need, No."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded, sat down again and leaned the katana against the table-leg. "Good, husband." she said to a still white-faced Genma.</p><p><b></b>Soun shook his head. Genma should better learn fast that his attitude towards women would lead him into a world of pain if he continued this path. True, a martial artist's path was fraught with peril, but Genma's peril was largely self-inflicted due to his idiocy.</p><p><b></b>Sometimes Soun wondered if Genma had taken the masters lessons a bit too much to heart. Hmm, maybe it would not be a bad thing if Ranma was Genma's daughter for a time. It could do his misogynistic friend a world of good.</p><p><b></b>Besides, if his daughter Kasumi was to spend time as his son, maybe the two would hit it off. <b>'Yes,'</b> Soun mused, <b>'if Kasumi and Ranma would like each other even when in cursed form, the schools will be joined for sure! But this time I'll let them find out if they have feelings for each other on their own and without any pressure.'</b></p><p><b></b>And a Soun Tendo in a much better mood set the Shogi board for another round, while a white-faced Genma was still recovering from near cardiac arrest.</p><p><b></b>After everything had been resolved to Nodokas' satisfaction the conversation was resumed. "So, Elder, how long does this lock last?"</p><p><b></b>Cologne thought for a moment. "If what Jusenkyo Products claimed in their product advertisement is true, one bar of soap lasts for ten days, as the magic of it latches onto the curse of the victim and not onto the skin only as the old soap did."</p><p><b></b>Nodoka smiled. "That would be ideal then. However, you mentioned that there are other options?"</p><p><b></b>The matriarch nodded. "I have some Chisuiiton water stored my tribe 'recovered' from the Musk several years ago." at seeing Ranma's expression darken the Elder hurried to continue, "It is old Chisuiiton water and its magic has degraded very much. I estimate that it would lock you for about five to six months."</p><p><b></b>Ranma gulped and presented warding signs. "No, no, no. No way! I don't wanna be locked that long! No freakin' way!"</p><p><b></b>Nodoka relented. Maybe five to six months were really a tad bit too much... "I guess you favour the soap then, Ranma?"</p><p><b></b>The cursed martial artist nodded vigorously. The others wondered how he survived the backlash..."Definitely, mom!"</p><p><b></b>The Saotome Matriarch nodded. "Elder, how long would it take to have the soap delivered?"</p><p><b></b>"Jusenkyo Products has switched to a new delivery. They made a contract with Fed-Ex, and due to that the delivery only takes four days. But in the meantime I can help out. I have some sample packages at the Nekohanten, and they'd be suffice for both son-in-law and Kasumi, at least for starters. I honestly never thought I'd need them, but Nerima surprises me time and time again." the Amazon leader said.</p><p><b></b>"Me too!" was the sentiment of everyone present.</p><p><b></b>One point however had made Ranma curious. "Old ghoul, how come the Jusenkyo guys still have a market for that soap? I mean, what with happened at Jusendo, the springs are gone!"</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded. She had anticipated this question. "You're right, son-in-law. There are however other Nannichuan and even Nyannichuan springs in the world. You know at least of the Japanese Nannichuan."</p><p><b></b>"But that didn' work!" Ranma exclaimed.</p><p><b></b>The Joketsuzoku Elder grinned, not a particularly nice sight. "You're right. And now you know that that was a good thing, ne?That does however not change the point that a workingJapanese Nannichuan once existed." Cologne paused. "There is also another Nyannichuan spring in the Amazon forests. Quite appropriate location, don't you think?" she cackled while the others face-faulted. "Pardon the pun. There are also several other Springs spread throughout the world. And don't forget the victims who had already been cursed at Jusenkyo before the happenings at Jusendo. You see, there is still a market for Jusenkyo products, and that will probably remain so for a long time to come."</p><p><b></b>"Ooookay..." Ranma said.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka nodded. "Good. Could you order this new waterproof soap? At least enough to last for three months for both Ranma and Kasumi. If we need more, we can always place a repeat order." she said, and Cologne nodded. "Ranma, I have a few questions for you concerning your female form."</p><p><b></b>Ranma nodded, unsure of what was to come. "Sure, mom. Shoot."</p><p><b></b>"Ranma," Nodoka began, "I'd like to know from you if your female body is fully functional or simply superficial."she asked, even though she knew that from Elder Cologne. This was a test if Ranma had any inkling of sex-ed at all, and also served as an indicator of how much her husband would have to be punished.</p><p><b></b>"Huh?" was Ranma's most intelligible reply, and already Nodoka Saotome began to expect the worst. Despite Kasumi's training, there was still a lot that Ranma did not understand. And how should he? Ranma had never had a sex-ed class at Principle Coconuts' school, and it had not been Kasumi's place to give Ranma the 'talk'…</p><p><b></b>"Have you experienced your first period?" Nodoka tried to clarify.</p><p><b></b>The expression still did not change. Hmm, time to try the big guns at point-blank range. Nodoka got up from her chair, grabbed a convenient glass of water and upended it over her sons' head, who then turned into her daughter. "Ranma, dear, have you bled down there?" she said and pointed at her son-turned-daughters crotch.</p><p><b></b>Ranma was confused, and Genma scrambled for the exit. "Come, Tendo, time to get drunk. <i>Really</i> drunk!" he exclaimed and dragged Soun out of the door, clearly planning not to return before next day. For Genma Saotome had heard enough. <i>More</i> than enough, actually.</p><p><b></b>He knew that his wife was now convinced that their son was also their daughter, and he knew his wife well enough to know that it made no sense to argue with her at all once she had made a decision. He'd, as always, give in and have his peace and quiet. And thus he simply stormed off, weeping for his poor, manly son who'd soon be turned into a flower loving sissy of a girl.</p><p><b></b>Mousse made a motion to follow the fathers. "I needn't know that... I needn't know that..." the half-blind Amazon chanted.</p><p><b></b>"And where do you think you're going, Mr. Part-time?"Cologne asked with a stern face.</p><p><b></b>"To the next bar. I need something strong!" Mousse replied.</p><p><b></b>"Too too stupid Mousse. Mousse don't drink!"</p><p><b></b>"Then it's high time I started!" the myopic boy exclaimed and was gone.</p><p><b></b>Cologne sighed and massaged her temples. <b>'I don't have a headache. Elders don't get a headache. Ahh, that's better.' </b></p><p><b></b>Shampoo looked at her great-grandmother. "Hibachan let stupid duck-boy go?"</p><p><b></b>The Elder sighed. "Why should I bother? Males are always so awfully insecure regarding this specific female topic. And it will be much fun to torture the boy when he has a hangover tomorrow." she cackled.</p><p><b></b>Shampoo nodded to herself. Hibachan was right. Now that the stupid males were gone... one sec. "Hibachan, why should Airen get period? Is husband, not wife!"</p><p><b></b>Ranma still did not understand and wanted to say just that, but her mother was faster. "Shampoo, a man who can understand the difficulty of a woman's 'time' is less likely to wave it off and will be more understanding. Won't you agree?" Nodoka explained, and Shampoo nodded after a moment of thought. She could see the Saotome Matriarchs' point. "Ranma, as you were interrupted with your answer, I'll ask again. Have you experienced your first period?" her mother asked.</p><p><b></b>The pigtailed girls' confusion had grown steadily. "Mom, what's a period?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>Everyone boggled. "I'd say that's a definite no." Nabiki said dryly.</p><p><b></b>That surprised Cologne most of all. "She did not even experience her period throughout the Cats tongue?" she asked.</p><p><b></b>"Cats tongue?" Nodoka asked.</p><p><b></b>"It is something I am not proud of, Saotome-san." Cologne admitted.</p><p><b></b>"Naw, its okay, old ghoul. I have forgiven you." Ranma said with a smile that warmed even the Elders heart.</p><p><b></b>This only strengthened her resolve to carry out her plan. She was now really sure that she could never bring Ranma into the tribe as Xian-Pus Airen. Ranma would never accept to be a mere husband, and if they forced him (she doubted that they could), he/she could bring down the whole tribe if angered enough.</p><p><b></b>This saddened her for her great-granddaughter, for she knew how much she loved Ranma. But the only way to resolve the situation would be to bring Ranma into the tribe as a warrior, as their ally. "Thank you for forgiving an old woman her foolishness, son-in-law."</p><p><b></b>Ranma still smiled. Today was a day of surprises. She would have never thought to hear Cologne of all people apologise. "You're welcome, Cologne-san." she said, although she still did not understand what that period stuff meant.</p><p><b></b>"I think I might have an explanation why Ranma did not experience a period until now." Kasumi cut in, and everyone looked at her.</p><p><b></b>Nabiki nearly grinned to herself. Finally her sister was coming out of her shell and showing her true self. She clearly remembered this kind of forwardness from her childhood, before their mother had died and before Kasumi had been forced into this housewife role. It seemed as if her true sister was finally coming back. "I think that Ranma was at the end of what would have been her cycle when the Cats Tongue was applied. And when it was finally lifted, nearly four weeks later, a new cycle had not begun yet." Kasumi explained.</p><p><b></b>Cologne nodded in understanding. "That makes sense." Then a thought hit the Elder. "Son-in-law, has someone given you the 'talk'?" she asked, half-dreading the answer. Knowing the worthless male that called himself Ranma's father, she suspected no.</p><p><b></b>"Umm... talk? Which talk? And about what?" Ranma asked, completely clueless. Periods? Cycle? Bled? What for Kami-samas' sake did they want? This was just like in these strange commercials she never understood and which only served to utterly confuse her.</p><p><b></b>Nodoka blanched. As did all other females. "WHAT!" she then screamed, "Do you mean Genma did <i>never</i> tell you what happens to boys and girls when they reach adolescence? Especially not after you got the curse and had to face going through puberty two times?" Ranma shook her head in a NO, surprised at her mothers' outburst. "GENMA!" Nodoka yelled, unsheathing her katana and waving it at the ceiling threateningly. And somewhere in Nerima, in a bar, to be precise, Genma Saotome sneezed.</p><p><b></b>"Oh my!" Kasumi exclaimed, voicing the thoughts of all present.</p><p><b></b>¹ those of you who wonder about Ryoga's behaviour towards Ranma and have only read this chapter, read Chapter 1. Everything's explained there.</p><p><b>to be continued…</b></p><p><b></b>My thanks go to Rose Vaughn and HeWhoWalksTheEarth for betaing this; my stories would only be half as good without you.</p><p>I'd also like to thank all of you who have taken the time to leave a review, and my review answers can be found at my yahoo group. I enjoy reading your comments, and the suggestions you all make will help to make this story even better.</p><p>If you find anything illogical that might have created a plot-hole or anything else that is wrong, let me know and I'll fix it.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
