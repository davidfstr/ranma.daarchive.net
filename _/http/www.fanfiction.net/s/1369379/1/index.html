</div>                Ranma ½    Journey's End<p>Disclaimer:  Ranma ½ is the property of the inestimable Takahashi Rumiko-sensei and is used  without permission. This is a piece of fan fiction and no profit is being made  off it.</p><p>Tendo Nabiki casually walked  down the streets of Nerima, pausing every so often to wipe the sweat from her  brow. It was the middle of summer, and Tokyo and the rest of Japan sweltered  under a heat wave. Had she been headed anywhere else, Nabiki would have taken  an air-conditioned taxi to her destination, but walking through Nerima some how  made it more real for Nabiki, renewing her attachment to the place where she  had grown up. She took in the sights that had not changed since she left and  sighed sadly. Nerima had died since the departure of the bunch of oddball  martial artists collectively known as the Nerima Wrecking Crew had vanished,  some how becoming a place frozen in time, waiting for something to happen, but  nothing ever did any more.</p><p>It had all started just after  Ranma and Akane's final year at high school, the year after the failed wedding,  a year of high tensions, passions running amok and desperate acts. Ever since  the wedding, when it became apparent that, though they would not say it, Ranma  and Akane truly did love each other, Ranma's fiancées and Akane's would be  paramours grew more and more desperate in their attempts to break the couple  up. Akane and Ukyo's tenuous friendship was strained to the absolute limit and  often they were barely able to remain civil to each other, while Shampoo had  done everything short of trying to murder both of them in their sleep and  Kodachi's tricks had gotten dirtier and more dangerous.</p><p>Kuno had been equally desperate,  even going so far as to flout the law and openly carry a katana and it was only  because of the fact that his image as a noble samurai warrior had to be  maintained that no one ever got hurt in those fights. Ryoga's attacks had also  taken on a desperate, vicious edge and at times it seemed that the lost boy was  about to lose his increasingly fragile grip on sanity. The only positive thing  there had been that, for reasons known only to himself, Mousse had called a  truce with Ranma and though they were far from the best of friends, the two  were actually polite to each other, though at times that too had been strained  and almost fell back into feuding on more than one occasion. Personally Nabiki  found it something of a miracle that those of the wrecking crew who attended  school managed to graduate and it had seemed only a matter of time until there  was a fatality. Then, the day after graduation, Ranma vanished.</p><p>It came as a complete surprise  to everyone; especially Nabiki and she had fumed about being tricked. Everyone  had searched high and low for the Jusenkyo cursed, pig-tailed martial artist,  but no one was able to find him. The only two people who had seemed absolutely  unconcerned were Genma and Akane. When questioned over his lack of worry, Genma  only replied why should he worry, since Ranma knew perfectly well how to take  care of himself. Akane's calm acceptance was odder, but when questioned, she  only smiled and said that Ranma had left her a note, and while it didn't say  where he had gone, it told her all she needed to know. She had swallowed the note  after committing it to memory and she refused to give any details about it.  Then, two days before the results of the university entrance exams came out,  Akane vanished as well.</p><p>Nabiki had expected that her  father would break down in tears as he normally did, but he took the incident  with an astonishing degree of equanimity. Akane had also left a note, though  this one was for public consumption and had been left stuck to the fridge door  with a magnet. It said, "I go to find the questions for the answers I already  know." That cryptic parting message had apparently been enough to assure Soun  about Akane's safety, though it had not kept Nabiki or Kasumi from worrying.  Nabiki had used every contact that she had, some of them perfectly legal, some  only quasi-legal at best, to try and find her, but the search for Akane was  equally fruitless as the one for Ranma had been.</p><p>That had been the turning point.  A week later Mousse left without a word of explanation to anyone. Ryoga had  shown up a month after that, had the situation explained to him and shown  Akane's cryptic note. His only reply had been a noncommittal grunt and no one  had seen or heard from him since. Not long after that, Ucchan's was found  closed with only a note from Ukyo saying she had business in Okinawa. Konatsu  left a few days later, heading for somewhere in Hokkaido. A few weeks after the  closing of Ucchan's, Shampoo had left for parts unknown, though Cologne stayed  and a few other Amazons came along to help her run the place. Eventually, the only  members of the Nerima Wrecking Crew left were the Kuno siblings and they  rattled around in their mansion like ghosts, all noise and no substance.</p><p>It had not just been the Nerima  Wrecking Crew that had left though, Ranma's friends Hiroshi and Daisuke had  left to attend university, as had Akane's friends Yuka and Saiyuri.  Hinako-sensei was transferred to another school, though she and Soun still kept  in touch, Gosunkugi Hikaru gave up photography, denounced voodoo and left to  become a priest at a mountain shrine and all the others that had hovered at the  edges of the ongoing saga that had been Ranma's life gradually drifted away.  Even Happosai was rarely seen any more and Nabiki herself had moved closer to  campus in her second year. The only real highlight of life in Nerima since  Ranma's departure had been Dr. Tofu's return and his proposal to Kasumi. She  had accepted of course and now they both lived at the Tendo home, Tofu making  the brief walk to his clinic every morning.</p><p>Nabiki herself had not been idle  either. Moving closer to campus and reducing the daily commute had given her a  lot more free time, and she had decided to use the extra time to take the  accelerated course. Her degree had been a business degree of course and not  only had she finished the accelerated course, she had graduated <i>sume cum  luade</i>, just in time for the Market Crisis of 2004. Due to a number of  various reasons, the American stock market had crashed catastrophically and  that sent shockwaves rippling through the rest of the financial world. Japan's  market had almost gone the same way as America's, but it had also been an  opportunity for great gain if one was willing to take the risks. Nabiki, the  ink on her diploma still wet so to speak, had risked everything and her gamble  succeeded. Nabiki's incredible gamble, and the ventures of a few other equally  brave souls had been encouragement enough that the market was kept from utter  collapse, though it had been a close thing. The reward of course was that in a  nation where business was still dominated by men, Nabiki stood above the heads  of most men.</p><p>It had also been during those,  wild, desperate days of riding the whirlwind of an economy spiralling out of  control, that Nabiki had met Shinta. Rare were the men not scared off by  Nabiki's drive and ambition, and most of those saw Nabiki as a rival at best,  or a hated enemy at worst. Shinta, an aspiring young architect, had no reason  to see her as enemy or rival, nor had he been frightened away by her ambition.  "What is the reason for dreaming, if you don't dream big," he had once said to  her. Their romance was slow and measured, like the steps of an old fashioned  dance, Shinta reaching out past the ice queen facade that Nabiki had cultivated  so long, it had almost become reflex, till one, long, glorious night they had  spent in each other's arms. It was their first time together, and their last.  The next day, as Nabiki waved goodbye and Shinta crossed the street, a driver  lost control of his car. There was nothing Nabiki could do as he died in her  arms.</p><p>That moment had almost destroyed  her. She had retreated into herself, and all that she had built threatened to  fall through her fingers and she didn't care. Then her brother-in-law gave her  a piece of news that she had not expected. She was pregnant. That had been all  the incentive that Nabiki needed and she through herself back into her work,  vowing that her child would have a mother to be proud of. Nine month's later  she gave birth to healthy baby girl she named Ai. Ai was currently staying with  her paternal grandparents, though the energetic little four year old was  disappointed at not getting to see her cousin, Kasumi and Tofu's son Kazuma,  who currently couldn't decide wether he wanted to be a world famous doctor, or  a world famous chef.</p><p>Nabiki paused a moment to put a  few coins into a vending machine and punched the button for a can of juice. As  she rolled the can over her forehead, she wondered if they would get another  postcard. Though Ranma and Akane were unable to be found, about six month's  after their respective departures, postcards and letters started arriving at  the Tendo dojo, some from Ranma, some from Akane. They almost immediately nixed  the idea that they had agreed to meet up together somewhere after they pulled  their vanishing acts. A month or so after Akane's first postcard arrived, two  postcards arrived, one from Ranma, another from Akane. They were both bore the  same date, but Ranma's was from Rio de Janeiro and Akane's was from Sri Lanka,  the postmarks bearing both out. They arrived intermittently and occasionally  included parcels containing birthday and Christmas gifts. Nabiki didn't know  how they found out, but they had also sent cards on condolence for Shinta's  death, arriving only days after the funeral, and presents for both the birth of  Kazuma and Ai.</p><p>Nabiki took a long swig from the  can, savouring the cool feel of the juice sliding down her throat and the sweet  tang on her tongue. As she lowered the can, she caught sight of a familiar  face, though one she had not seen for a long time. He was nearly a block down  the road and about to turn the corner, so Nabiki placed the can on top of the  vending machine, abandoned dignity and cupped her hands around her mouth.  "Hiroshi!"</p><p>The figure paused and looked in  her direction. "Nabiki?" came a surprised reply, made faint by the distance.</p><p>Nabiki nodded and waved that he  should join her, then retrieved her can of juice and headed to meet Hiroshi.  "Hiroshi, it's been along time," she said as they came close enough to each  other to talk without shouting. "What's the premiere sports writer in all of  Tokyo doing in Nerima? I thought that you had an apartment somewhere over in  Sumo Town."</p><p>"I did," Hiroshi admitted.  "Please note the past tense. Then for some reason I got a yearning to see the  old place again, decided to hell with the commute and moved back. I'd ask what  you're doing here, but I know, since your father and Kasumi still live here. I  ran into them earlier this morning and I must say, you're nephew promises to be  a real heartbreaker when he grows up. Might even give Ranma a run for his  money."</p><p>"Please, spare me," Nabiki said,  rolling her eyes dramatically. "I don't think I could live through that all  again."</p><p>Hiroshi nodded thoughtfully. "I  know what you mean. Things were getting really out of control at the end there.  I used to enjoy watching the fights, but towards the end they were getting  plain scary and every time one started, I was looking for cover."</p><p>"I wouldn't say that things were  out of control," Nabiki objected. "If they had been really out of control, none  of us would have known what hit us. Still, things were very tense."</p><p>"That they were," Hiroshi  agreed. "As bad as it was though, everything seemed to stop once Ranma left  though, and I don't just mean the fights. I mean everything. It was if the life  had gone completely out of the place."</p><p>Nabiki nodded thoughtfully. "I  was just thinking the same thing earlier."</p><p>The conversation would have gone  on longer, but just then Hiroshi's watch beeped and he made his apologies,  since he had a train to catch and couldn't afford to be late. He finished up  with an invitation for Nabiki to join him for lunch at the Nekohanten one day  to catch up on old times.</p><p>As he left, Nabiki felt some of  her energy return, despite the sapping heat. Hiroshi hadn't really contributed  much to the dynamic of Nerima, mainly just hormonal comments about Ranma's  female form, or agreeing to the same when said by his partner in puberty,  Daisuke, but with his return, Nerima seemed just a little bit more alive again,  as if gaining energy from memories of days past. With a renewed spring in her  step, Nabiki continued on her way to the dojo. The closer she got to the dojo,  though, the more things seemed different, as if the air were charged like  before a thunderstorm. It wasn't just that Hiroshi was back, it was something  more. Something had changed and things were coming back to life again. Mrs.  Katsuragi, older and more wizened than ever was ladling water of the stones of  the footpath, something she had not done for the last few, years, the strains  of ukulele music could be heard coming from the school as she passed it and  other, more subtle clues that didn't truly register on a conscious level.</p><p>Arriving at the dojo, still with  the same old sign directing challengers to the back entrance, Nabiki walked on  in. She had already phoned ahead to say that she was coming on Friday instead  of Saturday, so she knew that Kasumi was expecting her. As she took of her  shoes at the front door, she noticed a pair of shoes there that she didn't  recognise. There were Kasumi's sensible, heelless shoes, Tofu's equally  sensible plain shoes, though he didn't wear them much, her father's larger  sandals and Kazuma's smaller ones that he wore when not going to or from school  and a pair of well worn hiking shoes that looked like they had some tales to  tell, judging by the wear and tear. Nabiki recognised the brand, even under all  the dust, and they had only come on the market a few years ago, so they had  seen some pretty serious use.</p><p>Wondering who on Earth could be  visiting, Nabiki walked straight into the living room, finding Kasumi, Tofu and  Soun sitting out the table with a figure she didn't immediately recognise. The  figure was about the same height as Nabiki, with dark hair that had been  bleached by the sun and well tanned. She wore a t-shirt that had once been blue  but had bleached out until it was almost white, with slightly tattered edges  where the sleeves had been removed, a pair of cut off jeans that rode low on  the hips and socks that had once been white, but were now a dirty grey. The  woman was well muscled, without looking like a body builder, just enough body  fat to soften the lines and give her some nice curves. Her sun-bleached hair  had been pulled back in a single, thin ponytail that reached almost to the  floor and a bright yellow ribbon kept it out of her eyes. It was the eyes that  finally gave it away and Nabiki, in a rare moment of complete shock, stared  opened mouth at her younger sister. "Akane! When? How? Where? Why? What?"</p><p>Akane laughed and stood,  embracing Nabiki. "It's good to see you to neechan. Sorry for startling you,  but I wanted it to be a surprise."</p><p>Nabiki finally got control of  herself, and hugged Akane back fiercely, a little surprised at the strength of  Akane's grip. The youngest Tendo daughter had always been strong, but Nabiki  could feel not only the strength that Akane was using, but the amount that she  was holding back as well, which was even more startling. "It's good to see you  imouto-chan," was all Nabiki could say, her voice hoarse with emotion. "When  did you get back?"</p><p>"I just got back to Japan the  other day and it was too late to reach Nerima, so I stayed overnight at a  hotel. I got here not half an hour ago, but when Tofu rang to tell you, all he  got was your answering machine."</p><p>"I decided to leave a little  early to beat the heat."</p><p>Soun cleared his throat.  "Perhaps it might be easier if we all sat down and Akane could tell her story  from the beginning," he suggested.</p><p>"Just let me get something cool  to drink first," Kasumi said, rising. "I'm sure we'd all be more comfortable  with something to cool off."</p><p>As she left the room Akane  looked around. "I know it's a bit on the warm side, but it's not that hot is  it?"</p><p>Tofu just looked at her. "Akane,  it's over thirty degrees outside, and there's not a breath of air. Are you  honestly telling me that you're not hot?"</p><p>Akane nodded decisively, and  then grinned a little sheepishly. "On the road you learn how to ignore the  weather. Hot, cold, rain, snow, there doesn't seem to be all that much  difference after a while."</p><p>Kasumi returned at that point,  carrying a tray with five glasses, all filled to the brim with lemonade and so  cold that water was condensing on their sides. Kasumi handed the glasses out  and Soun gestured that Akane should begin.</p><p>Akane sat, thinking for a  moment, her eyes taking on a distant look. "It all began after the failed  wedding attempt," she said reflectively. "I'm pretty sure you all noticed that  things started going downhill after that fairly fast. Ranma and I just wanted  to be left alone to sort out what we felt for each other, but no one would  leave us alone. I'll admit that there were times that I just wanted to grab  Ukyo and beat the living daylights out of her and on occasions it was all I  could do not to throttle Shampoo.</p><p>"It wasn't just them though. I  loved Ranma, and I'm pretty certain that he loved me back, but we couldn't get  married, not like we were. Everything was just too uneven. It wasn't just that  he was a better martial artist than me; it seemed like everything I tried to  do, he was better at and I just couldn't bear the thought of spending the rest  of my life in his shadow, or anyone else's. I probably took it out on him more  than he deserved and I'm not proud of that, but I won't deny it either. Then,  just when I was sure the next fight was going to put someone in the hospital,  or maybe even the morgue, Ranma left. Some of what was on the note he left for  me was private, and I'm still not going to say anything about it, but part of  it was a list of places he had heard about that could help me. So, after a  while I decided to look some of them up, making sure I went to the ones out of  Japan first. I must have spent what seemed like three years at this little place  in the foothills of the Himalayas and then from there, I started wandering all  over the place. All across Asia, into Europe, down into Africa. I've been  almost everywhere but Antarctica. Eventually I decided that it was time to  return home, and here I am."</p><p>Nabiki frowned. "Wait a minute  Akane. You spent three years somewhere in India, but we've got postcards from  that time saying you were in Paris, or another from Indonesia. You can't have  spent three years there."</p><p>Akane smiled. "I said it seemed  like three years, I never said it was three years. I'd like to tell you more,  but there are secrets I am bound not to reveal."</p><p>Nabiki was about to object, when  Soun raised his hand. "If your sister has promised not to tell, then she will  not tell. I have heard of places like this, where only those who swear to keep  their secrets may learn what they offer."</p><p>Tofu agreed. "Some of the places  I studied demanded similar things from me, and usually for very good reason.  Some of the things I learnt are not for public consumption."</p><p>Nabiki frowned but said nothing  and everyone lapsed into silence for several moments until Kasumi spoke up.  "Still Akane, that seems a very bare bones description. Surely more must have  happened than that."</p><p>Akane grinned. "True," she  admitted. "But even just touching on the high points is a very long story. It's  been eight years after all, and some of the stuff wouldn't be believed by  anyone who hasn't lived in Nerima. Are you sure you want to hear it?"</p><p>"Spill already," Nabiki  insisted. "After an introduction like that, I'm really curious. So start  talking."</p><p>Akane took a long swig of her  lemonade and then sat back in a relaxed posture that suggested she wasn't  kidding about it being a long story. Her eyes unfocussed somewhat and she began  to speak; calling forth memories that had dulled slightly with the years and  began to weave a tale that swept everyone away.</p><p>Khu Lon, Matriarch of the  Joketsu Amazons, though better known locally as Cologne, sighed as she looked  out over the empty restaurant. Business was not as brisk as it had once been,  and the unseasonable heat had driven most people in search of cooler food for  their luncheon break, rather than a big, steaming bowl of ramen. It was times  like this that she wondered if she had made a mistake in keeping the Nekohanten  open after her great-granddaughter's departure. Business was much slower than  it had been for years, and like many others who had lived through the era of  the Nerima Wrecking Crew and had stayed on after their diaspora, Cologne found  that the life had gone out of the place.</p><p>The Nekohanten had originally  been little more than a way of providing a base of operations from which  Shampoo could conduct her campaign for Ranma's hand in matrimony. Still Cologne  found that running the place had given her back some of her youthful energy, as  well as a safe vantage point from which to observe the continual parade of  characters who passed by the door. Eventually Cologne bowed out of the  situation all together and devoted her energies entirely to the restaurant.  Even after Ranma's departure, followed by Mousse's and Shampoo's, not to  mention several others, she had kept the restaurant open as a way of keeping  the tribe in touch with the rest of the world. But gradually business declined and  most of her tribal sisters lost interest in the venture, the only two staying  being Liu Shun, who had picked up the name Lotion, a chef who found too little  scope to exercise her talents in the village, and Jia La, or Gel, Mousse's  cousin who wasn't quite as blind as he was, but still useless without her  glasses and with almost no interest in becoming a warrior. There were times  when Cologne was almost ready to call everything quits and head back to the  village, and would have several years ago if it hadn't been for the fact that  the village no longer felt like home.</p><p>Her morose ponderings were  interrupted by the sound of heavy footsteps entering the restaurant. The  originator of those sounds was a young man, perhaps in his mid-twenties, tall  and powerfully built. He wore heavy working boots that rose up to mid calf over  thick, canvas trousers of an indeterminate buff colour. His shirt was a faded  yellow, tight over his chest and arms, allowing well-defined muscles to show  through and over that he wore a grey canvas great coat with a number of large  pockets sewn into it. His hair was short, little more than fuzz, like it had  been shaved off and was only starting to grow back, which made Cologne wonder  why the man wore a bandanna around his forehead. It wasn't until she took note  of the black and yellow pattern of the bandanna that she realised who the man  was, and a quick glance at red paper umbrella resting atop his pack confirmed  it and Cologne felt herself grinning.</p><p>"Well, well, well," she said,  grabbing her staff and hoping over to the door. "If it isn't Hibiki Ryoga  showing up on my doorstep after nearly eight years without so much as a word to  anyone. Of course there's always the chance that you couldn't find a telephone  booth or post office."</p><p>Ryoga grinned, his fangs  dimpling his lower lip. "It's good to see you too Old Ghoul," he said. "It's  nice to finally see a familiar face. I was beginning to wonder if everyone I  knew in Nerima had up and left."</p><p>"It seems like it sometimes,"  Cologne agreed. "Pull up a seat my boy, and have a meal. It's been a long time  since someone has come in here with something interesting to tell. What have  you been up to all these years?"</p><p>Ryoga's smile grew even broader  as he dumped his pack and coat on the floor. Judging by the dull thud both made  when they landed, Cologne was fairly certain that their sheer weight was  security measure enough, especially in Japan, a place with one of the lowest  street crime rates in the world. Before the fanged martial artist could speak, Cologne  held up one hand. "Liu Shun! One deluxe ramen, hold the pork! Saotome size!"</p><p>There was a momentary, startled  pause from the kitchen and then, "One Saotome size deluxe ramen, hold the pork,  coming up!"</p><p>Ryoga chuckled. "Saotome size?"</p><p>Cologne grinned back. "It's been  eight years since he left, and I still haven't met anyone who can eat as much  as that boy. But this isn't about him, this is about you. Eight years is a long  time for someone to get lost, even you."</p><p>"True," Ryoga agreed, leaning  back in his chair, and causing a few, slightly ominous creaks. "But that hasn't  been a problem for nearly seven years now. I got both my curses cured. Jusenkyo  and my problems with directions."</p><p>Cologne had been around long  enough to learn how to control her actions, so she merely raised a surprised  eyebrow instead of letting her eyes bug out of her head. "No mean trick," she  said. "Both at once, or separately?"</p><p>"Separately, though it was the  same person who cured me in both cases."</p><p>"I take it them you found someone  with a large degree of proficiency in the magical arts then."</p><p>"She preferred the term  sorceress, but yes."</p><p>"May I ask how she did it?"</p><p>Ryoga shrugged. "I don't know  all the details, and most of the explanation went over the top of my head. I'm  a martial artist, not a magician, but as I understand it, Dame Morrigan didn't  actually cure my directional curse. Instead she tied what she called a  countering gift onto it, cancelling the effects out. Now I'm no better or worse  than an average person."</p><p>"So it was indeed a true curse  and not just a spectacularly bad sense of direction?"</p><p>Ryoga nodded. "One of my  ancestors must have annoyed a powerful magic user many generations ago. For  reasons that escape me completely the curse dies out in a generation or two  when one of us marries into another family, but actually infects those who  marry into the family after a few years. Dame Morrigan said that it must have  been someone very powerful and skilled for the curse to have lasted so long."</p><p>"And your Jusenkyo curse?"</p><p>Ryoga beamed at the mention of  that. "P-chan is no more. Dame Morrigan refused to tell me how she managed it,  but she successfully removed the Jusenkyo curse about six months after she  cleared up my sense of direction."</p><p>Cologne nodded. The sort of magic  required to neutralise a Jusenkyo curse, let alone remove it completely, was  best kept secret, even from the one having the curse removed, for if it should  fall into the wrong hands, it could create another Jusenkyo, or possibly even  worse. Out loud she said, "Of course this all begs the question, who is this  Dame Morrigan to whom you keep referring?"</p><p>Before Ryoga could answer Gel  came out of the kitchen balancing a massive ramen bowl on a tray. She walked  carefully over to the table where Ryoga and Cologne were sitting and placed it  in front of the ex-Lost Boy. "Please enjoy meal and thank you eating at  Nekohanten," she said in broken Japanese worse than Shampoo's had ever been,  bowing as she did so. Then, before Ryoga could say anything, she backed away  and disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>"Amazon?" Ryoga asked, grabbing  a pair of disposable chopsticks from the centre of the table and easily  separating them.</p><p>Cologne nodded as Ryoga dug into  his ramen. "After Shan Pu left, I persuaded some of the other members of the  tribe to come work here for a time, to gain experience in the outside world.  Most grew rather disenchanted with it after a while and now Jia La and Liu Shan  are the only ones left. And in case you thought she looked familiar, Jia La is  Muu Tsu's cousin."</p><p>Ryoga paused in his eating long  enough to nod his understanding and then continued with his meal. The enormous  bowl was half empty when he spoke again. "You asked who Dame Morrigan was  right?"</p><p>Cologne nodded.</p><p>"She's a Knight-Errant of the  Order of the Bladeless Sword. They're a group of magic users who formed about  four centuries ago in Europe. I never did manage to find out what they actually  do, but Morrigan hired me as a sort of bodyguard while she searched for some  mystic artefact for the Order. I don't know what it does, or why they wanted  it, heck I can't even remember what the damned thing's called, but it was  pretty good and kept me busy for about a year and a half."</p><p>"And the rest of the time?"</p><p>"The usual sort of thing for a  wandering martial artist," Ryoga replied with a faint grin and a slight shrug.  "Training in the mountains, entering the occasional tournament and getting  mixed up in things I'd much rather avoid. Apart from the tournaments, it was a  lot like things here in Nerima, just the scenery and names changed more often.  I even managed to revise the Shi Shi Hokoudan so that it no longer uses  depression as a focus."</p><p>"Oh?" Cologne said, impressed  despite herself. That simple statement carried to very important messages with  it. First was the fact that Ryoga was now at the level were he was revising and  creating his own special techniques, rather than just learning what had been  devised by others, something only Ranma had managed amongst his contemparies  before they had scattered to the winds. Second was the fact that not only had  Ryoga broken the vicious cycle of depression that fed on itself necessary to  make the full use of the Shi Shi Hokoudan, something that often drove the users  eventually into madness, suicide or a complete withdrawal from reality, but  also that he had found something with which to replace it, putting him on much  more stable emotional footing, at least potentially. "So what do you use as  your focus now?" she asked curiously.</p><p>"Hope," Ryoga replied. "Hope  that no matter what happens, tomorrow will be a better day. Hope that if just  one person can make a difference, the world will become a better place. Hope  that good will eventually triumph over evil. I still call it the Shi Shi  Hokoudan though. I suppose I should call it the revised Shi Shi Hokoudan, but  I'd feel silly yelling that out in the middle of a battle."</p><p>This got a grin from Cologne.  And it gave her a sense of satisfaction. Choosing that particular focus had its  drawbacks, and hope could be a very fragile thing at times, but there were  definitely worse things in the world than unbridled optimism. "So do you think  that this new Shi Shi Hokoudan of yours is enough to overcome Ranma's Mokou  Takabisha?" she asked. "Just out of curiosity."</p><p>"I don't know," Ryoga admitted  with a shrug, swallowing a mouthful of ramen. "I've managed to get it pretty  strong, but Ranma's ego was a powerful thing, and from what I've heard in my  journeys, that is one thing that hasn't changed in the slightest."</p><p>"So you kept in touch with  Ranma?"</p><p>"Not really. It was mostly  rumours and second and third hand stories that had altered with the telling."</p><p>Cologne digested all this  information as Ryoga continued to make inroads of his meal, eating quickly, but  quietly. But one thing drew kept drawing her attention, even while she tried to  think. Ryoga's hair. When he had left Nerima, he had been possessed of a fairly  thick mop of head, and the current state of his hair was too long for him to  hake taken up shaving it as some were wont to do, yet the evenness of the cut  suggested more than a simple accident. "Tell me Ryoga," she said casually.  "What happened to your hair?"</p><p>That actually managed to get a  blush out of him. "It's kind of embarrassing," he admitted.</p><p>"I won't tell anyone if you  don't want me to."</p><p>Ryoga smiled a little sadly.  "I've caused enough trouble with promises like that. It's not that bad anyhow.  A few months ago, I had a run in with a vat of some sort of depilatory. It  actually causes hair to dissolve, right down to the roots if you let it work  long enough. It dissolved my hair and eyebrows, but I was able to wash it off  quickly enough that they are starting to grow back, but the rest of me wasn't  so lucky." He held up a hand at slightly below chin height. "Bald as an egg  from here down."</p><p>Cologne covered her mouth with  one hand to help suppress the snicker that rose unbidden from her throat. "Oh  my," she managed to get out, borrowing a phrase from Kasumi.</p><p>"I get that a lot," Ryoga said  and then drank the last of his ramen broth. Putting the bowl down he said,  "What do I owe you for the meal?"</p><p>Cologne waved one hand in  dismissal of payment. "On the house, for old time's sake. This place has become  so dull that anything new is worth the price of a meal at least."</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"I'm sure, I'm sure. Business  may not be great, but its not that bad yet."</p><p>"Well thanks. I'd better do find  a place to say if I'm going to stick around for a few days."</p><p>"Wait a moment," Cologne said.  "If you're planning on staying for a while, we have some spare space. When more  of our tribal sisters were working here, we hired an extra apartment to give  them all room to stay and we still have it. You'll have to share with Liu Shan,  but you'll at least have your own room."</p><p>Ryoga pondered it for a moment.  "All right," he said. "But I insist that you let me pay rent for while I'm  staying there. I don't want to be a freeloader."</p><p>"I'm sure we can work something  out," Cologne assured him. "I'll show you the way." She then turned and raised  her voice. "Liu Shan! I'll be gone for a few minutes. Take over out front!"</p><p>It was indeed a short walk to  the apartment, and it was on the bottom floor so there were no worries about  the floor being able to take the combined weight of Ryoga's pack, coat and umbrella.  "Are you sure Lotion won't mind?" Ryoga asked, already mangling the Amazon  chef's name into a bathroom product.</p><p>"Are you kidding? A guinea pig  with an iron constitution to test new recepies on, she'll be ecstatic. Now I  must be getting back. Liu Shan's Japanese isn't much better than Shan Pu's was  and its best if I handle the customers. Liu Shan should be home some time  around nine or ten, so make yourself at home until then."</p><p>As Cologne left, bouncing away  on her staff, Ryoga turned and began retrieving items from his back and the  pockets of his coat and placing them around the empty room.</p><p>At the same time as Ryoga was  settling into to his temporary accommodations and Akane was regaling her family  with stories of her exploits a man was going through customs at Narita airport.  He was taller than Ryoga, with long, glossy black hair tied into a number of  braids that were pinned up, twisted and then pinned up again. He wore loose,  white silk robes that reached down to his shins with wide, open sleeves, loose,  pale blue drawstring trousers of the same material and shoes made of leather so  soft that it almost seemed to be cloth. What most people noticed about him  first though was his face, or more specifically, the black leather patch over  his left eye.</p><p>He walked up the customs counter  and waited, as the line seemed to move forward at a crawl. Narita may have been  one of the largest airports in Japan, but it never seemed to have enough  facilities to handle the massive numbers of people that went through it. Though  from the experiences of the one eyed man, it was far from unique in that  respect. He finally got to the front of the line and walked to one of the  customs desks, handing over his passport.</p><p>"Business or personal?" the  receptionist asked in a voice that suggested that she had said that phrase far  too many times already today and would have to keep saying it far more often  that she would like until the day was over.</p><p>"Personal," the man replied.</p><p>The receptionist marked his  passport, than really looked at it for the first time. She noted his name, Muu  Tsu, written in both pinyin and Chinese characters, looked at the photo and  then looked at the line stating citizenship. "You'll forgive me sir, but I must  say that you look neither Irish or Moroccan."</p><p>Mousse smiled at that. "It's a  long story. I've been travelling for a few years and for a number of reasons  the Chinese government revoked my citizenship. I had some friends in both  Ireland and Morocco who arranged for me to get dual citizenship in both  countries. It may sound a bit far fetched, but the passport is legitimate, I  assure you."</p><p>The receptionist accepted his  word and continued going through the procedures, but it had been enough to lift  her out of the monotonous routine of her job for a moment and Mousse was sure  that he would be the talk of the lunchroom for the next several days at least,  maybe even longer if things hit a particularly dull stretch. He went through  the rest of the customs procedure without too much hassle and finally headed  for the baggage exchange to collect his minimal luggage. As he was waiting for  his travel pack to show up, he thought he caught sight of a familiar face, but  couldn't be sure in the crowd.</p><p>Flicking his gaze between the  baggage carousel and the possibly familiar person, he tried to edge closer. The  press of bodies meant that he was largely unsuccessful. He could have done it  other ways of course, but that would have just drawn unnecessary attention to  him and possibly frighten off the person he was trying to get to. Still Mousse  was successful enough that when he was close enough to get a better look as the  person bent down to retrieve several pieces of luggage and that was enough.  Mousse was certain that he knew them. He was fortunate that his travel back  arrived at that moment and he was able to snag it and follow straight away.</p><p>He waited till he was close  enough so that he didn't have to shout to get their attention. "Konatsu!" he  called, raising his voice just enough to be make it clear over the background  noise. The person he was following turned towards him and Mousse blushed in  embarrassment as he realised that the person in front of him was not the  cross-dressing kunoichi. For one thing, this person was most definitely female  in a way that not even the most skilled cross-dresser could fake. "My apologies  miss," he said, backing off slightly. "I'm afraid I mistook you for someone  else."</p><p>"No you didn't Mousse-san,"  Konatsu replied with a demure smile. "It's me."</p><p>Mousse frowned and pulled a  monocle from inside his sleeve, holding it up to his eye. The surgery meant  that he only really needed it for reading, but there were times it was better  to be safe than sorry. The face was definitely very similar, but there were  subtle differences, especially around the hips and elbows that said that the  person in front of him was definitely female. Those were differences in  skeletal structure that no surgeon could counterfeit and despite the  appearance, the Konatsu that Mousse knew was possessed of a Y chromosome. "Konatsu?  Is that really you?"</p><p>Konatsu nodded. "It's good to  see you as well Mousse-san."</p><p>Mousse nodded, still frowning.  "I don't mean to pry," he said quietly, trusting in the kunoichi (apparently in  fact as well as name now) had sufficiently sharp hearing to make out what he  was saying. "But what happened to you? Last I saw you were a guy and now you're  definitely a woman, and this was no surgeon's job."</p><p>"You're quite right," Konatsu  replied. "It's probably easier if we go somewhere private to talk though. I  know somewhere we can go without being overhead."</p><p>Mousse nodded and Konatsu led  the way to one of the airports attached to the airport, and more specifically  into a little restaurant that was part of the hotel. The restaurant had clearly  been built with people who wanted privacy in mind, and Konatsu led Mousse to  secluded booth where it was highly unlikely that anyone would be able to get  close enough to them to hear anything without being noticed. A waiter appeared  as if out of nowhere and took their orders, green tea for Konatsu and oolong  tea for Mousse. When he was gone, Mousse leaned back and spoke in a voice  barely above a whisper. "So, what happened?"</p><p>Konatsu's reply was just as soft  as Mousse's question, but the Master of the Hidden Weapons style had fairly  acute hearing himself. "Nyannichuan."</p><p>Mousse cocked his head in  confusion. "I thought that was one of the springs that was destroyed when  Jusenkyo flooded, along with the Nannichuan."</p><p>"They were," Konatsu agreed.  "But the Musk had considered such a possibility, especially as their culture  requires the springs to continue. They have enough Nyannichuan water stockpiled  to last them several centuries, though no Nannichuan water. Someone once stall  a small keg of it from them. The person who actually did it was eventually  caught and cursed and locked and made the bride of one of the Musk warriors,  but they were able to pass the keg on to someone else. I found it and returned  it to them, after using just enough to curse myself."</p><p>"How did you get away without  one of them trying to make you his bride?" Mousse asked, rather surprised. The  fact that very few women would willingly have anything to do with the Musk  meant that when one of them entered Musk territory, they were rarely allowed to  leave again. The only reason Herb hadn't become the bride of one of his own  warriors when he had been accidentally locked in his cursed form was that, male  or female, he was still powerful enough to make anyone who tried it very sorry.</p><p>"They assumed that I was still  male," Konatsu said simply. "When I first went to them, they didn't believe me  when I said that I was actually male, so I had to strip to prove that it was a  disguise. Once I became cursed, they didn't have any reason to assume that I  wasn't a man in drag."</p><p>"Clever," Mousse said. "Though I  do have another question. Are you actually locked, or can you still change."</p><p>"Oh, I can change," Konatsu  said. "I wasn't about to attempt to try and steal the Chiitsuon, not when it  was hanging from Herb's belt. I could have done it, but it would have caused  more trouble than it was worth. I do use waterproof soap though to help stay  like this. The Jusenkyo Salesman is still doing a brisk business in some items,  even if the springs themselves are almost all flooded."</p><p>The waiter arrived at that point  with their tea and they fell silent for a few moments as he placed them on the  table and enquired if they would require anything else. They assured him that  they would not, and he left as unobtrusively as he arrived.</p><p>Konatsu took a sip of her tea  and then put it back down. "Now, if you wouldn't mind Mousse-san, I would like  to ask you a question. What happened to your eye?"</p><p>Mousse sat and thought for a  moment, still sipping at his tea. When he put it down there was an odd look in  his good eye. He looked around for a second, just to make sure that no one was  watching and then lifted one hand to both lift the eye patch and shield his  face from everyone but Konatsu's view. He lifted the patch to reveal a  perfectly normal looking pair of eyelids behind it. Then he opened them.</p><p>The first impression got was of  a pearl floating on a pool of mercury, for that was exactly what the glowing  white orb surrounded by a field of silver that filled the rest of the eye  socket looked like. Then the orb unfurled, like a flower budding at high speed.  As it unfurled, each of the glowing 'petals' changed from pure white, slowing  gaining colour, like a soft, pearlescent rainbow spiralling inwards. At the  very centre, tiny little peaks of light seemed to rise, glittering with the  reflected colours of the 'petals' and dancing like figures in a tiny ballet.  Konatsu's hands were raised demurely to her mouth to cover the 'o' of surprise  and her eyes were wide with astonishment.</p><p>"What was that?" she breathed as  the petals furled themselves up once more into a white sphere and Mousse closed  his eyes, letting the eyepatch settle back into place.</p><p>"It's called the Eye of the  Infinite," Mousse said, making sure the eyepatch was sitting in place properly before  taking another sip of his tea. "The story of exactly how I got it is a very  long one, but it is magical in nature. I'm not certain of the full extent of  its power, but I do know that it can see through any illusion, no matter what,  among other things."</p><p>"Was having it replace your  original eye painful?" Konatsu asked, prompted by the same sort of morbid  fascination that makes people pick as scabs and rubberneck at accidents.</p><p>Mousse shook his head, making  his braids swing. "It didn't actually replace my eye. What happened was the  power of the Eye of the Infinite... infected my eye for lack of a better word,  and changed it into what it is now. Apart from a bit of numbness around the eye  socket, I didn't feel anything."</p><p>After that, both of them continued  to drink their tea for several moments, until Konatsu spoke up. "May I ask  where you're heading now that you're back in Japan?"</p><p>"Actually I'm heading back to  Nerima," Mousse said. "From what I hear, Cologne's still running the Nekohanten  there. I've had enough wandering around for a while and I though it might be  nice to actually stay in the one place for more than a few weeks."</p><p>"I understand," Konatsu said.  "I'm going back myself. I never actually spent much time there, but even after  all these years, it still feels like home.</p><p>"Even more so than the village,"  Mousse agreed. "Who knows. If we get lucky, we might even see some of the rest  of the old gang while we're there. I mean, what were the odds of us meeting in  a crowded airport like this."</p><p>"Mousse-san, if there is one  thing I learned while I lived in Nerima, it is this. When it comes to Nerima  and those who live it in, the odds have nothing to do with it."</p><p>If there was one thing that  Shampoo hated about Japan, it was the public transport system, specifically the  Tokyo metropolitan subways. Some of the architecture, especially in the big  cities, laid far to much emphasis on function opposed to aesthetics in her  opinion, but it wasn't anything that she couldn't live with. Part of her also  thought that there was far too much fish in the average Japanese diet, but that  was counterbalanced by the fact in feline form she was quite content to eat  nothing but fish. The sexism she also encountered amongst a large portion of  the male population was also extremely annoying, but it usually took only one  quick demonstration to change their opinions of her, regardless of what they  thought of women in general. But what she couldn't stand was the fact that if  one wanted to go anywhere in the Tokyo area that was further away than  convenient walking distance, then one was obliged to be squashed into a train  carriage that was filled with at least three times the number of people it had  designed to carry.</p><p>It wasn't only the close  crowding that got to Shampoo when riding the subway, though that was a large  part of it. The rest of it was the annoying perverts who used the extremely  close quarters to cop a feel. Shampoo understood that sometimes it was  accidental and in such cramped conditions people's hands sometimes wind up in  places other than where they had intended. Those were usually withdrawn with a  murmured apology and she let them go. Some of them were far from accidental  though, even if the perpetrators tried to pass it off as such. Shampoo could  tell the difference though and even is she was denied the full movement of her  limbs, that hadn't stopped her from sending the last three miscreants off with  broken fingers. Shampoo was quite proud of her figure and was not averse to  basking in the admiring stares of those around her, but unsolicited gropes were  an entirely different matter.</p><p>It was with great relief that  Shampoo disembarked when the train at her station, breaking the fingers of a  fourth opportunist as she stepped onto the platform. She worked her way over to  one side of the crowd and stretched once she had the room to swing her arms,  working the kinks out of them. An instant later her danger sense kicked in and  she stepped to one side and the man whose fingers she had just broken charged  her. He skidded forward a couple of metres before checking his rush and turning  around and facing Shampoo again. "You bitch!" he growled. "You broke my  fingers."</p><p>Shampoo just gave him an arch  look and replied, "It wouldn't have happened if you had kept your hands to  yourself. Next time you try and grope a woman on the train, remember that not  all of us are harmless. Play with fire and you will get burned."</p><p>The man flushed with  humiliation, especially as the comment had been heard by the people who had  stopped to see what was going on. With a snarl or rage he charged Shampoo  again, and she sidestepped him again, but this time, instead of just dodging,  she hooked one foot around his and kicked upward with enough force that the man  actually flipped over before landing on the tiled platform, momentarily  stunned.</p><p>Before he got a chance to  recover, Shampoo took one long step to stand next to his head and put her  shoe-clad foot to his throat, applying just enough pressure to let the man know  that she could increase it anytime she wanted. "Why don't we just leave it  here?" she suggested calmly. "Before you humiliate yourself any more thoroughly  than you already have." There was no response, so she increased the pressure of  her foot against his throat slightly. "I said, why don't you just leave it  here," she repeated, her tone just a touch more menacing.</p><p>The man on the floor nodded as  best he could with a foot on his throat, which was withdrawn shortly  afterwards.</p><p>"See, it wasn't that hard,"  Shampoo told him sweetly as he got to his feet. "Now why don't you go see a  doctor about those fingers. I'm sure that they must be hurting." The man turned  away sharply and scurried away like a dog that had just been whipped and  Shampoo sighed. "Some people just never learn," she said in an exasperated tone  of voice, before heading away herself before the fool could call the police  down on her. Of course if they tried, she would turn the entire thing into a  diplomatic incident quite cheerfully. Which reminded her, she needed to have  her passport photo updated, the last one having been taken just before she left  Nerima, when she was still possessed of her long violet tresses.</p><p>Her hair was still violet, that  was natural rather than died as most people seemed to think and was caused by  her tribe living near Jusenkyo for so long, but instead of the luxurious wealth  of hair she used to possess, now it was clipped short. The style was still  feminine, but now it was only about five centimetres from tip to scalp. She had  also discarded her silk pantsuits as her day wear of choice, instead choosing a  more practical ensemble of jean, a t-shirt that had been tie-dyed purple and  comfortable running shoes. It had taken some effort to get used to fighting in  the shoes as opposed to the thin-soled slippers she used to wear, but they were  more practical for walking long distances over sometimes treacherous terrain.</p><p>Once her would be assailant was  out of sight and the small crowd that had gathered began to drift away, Shampoo  set out for the steps her self, squinting a little as she emerged into bright  daylight. She raised her hand to shield her eyes until they adjusted and began  looking around, both to get her bearings and to try and spot a good place to  get something to eat. She grinned when she saw the perfect spot, a yattai  selling okonomiyaki. Normally she preferred ramen but somehow okonomiyaki  seemed more appropriate at that moment, and besides, the afternoon was starting  to wear on and as her stomach reminded her, it had been quite a while since  that skimpy pre-dawn breakfast.</p><p>She casually strolled over to  the yattai, weaving in and out of the crowds more by instinct that conscious  action, until she got a good look at it. It was attended by two people. One was  a fairly old man with only a few patches of wispy grey hair left on his head  that looked like they were ready to disappear as well and wearing an apron  bearing a repeat of the logo that was on the yattai's sign, probably the owner.  The other, who was actually working the grill, was a man about Shampoo's age  who had apparently missed the fact that heavy metal had been and gone. Despite  the warm weather he wore a heavy, metal studded, black leather jacket over a  black shirt, thick black jeans held up by a metal studded belt and probably  heavy black boots. Shampoo couldn't see the boots, but she accurately deduced  their existence since the rest of the outfit literally demanded their presence.  And of course it wouldn't have been complete with out the black shades, the  skull and cross bone earrings and the fingerless gloves.</p><p>It wasn't until Shampoo got  closer that she recognised the familiar pattern of the hands working the  okonomiyaki on the hot plate. They stood out like a sore thumb from most styles  of okonomiyaki making, since at least half the moves were also meant for combat  as well as cooking. Looking closer Shampoo also realised that there were few  discrepancies in the chef's appearance as well. The chest was just a little too  flat for one thing, and the jeans didn't sit quite right, for a guy anyway. With  a grin, Shampoo walked over and sat down at one of the yattai's stools. "Deluxe  okonomiyaki," she said to the person behind the grill. "Hold the gunpowder."</p><p>"It's good to see you too  Shampoo," Ukyo replied with a grin as her hands automatically moved to assemble  the ingredients. "It's been a while."</p><p>"It has indeed," Shampoo said,  watching as Ukyo's hands moved with a speed that only a trained martial artist  could follow, let alone achieve, shaping the batter on the grill and adding the  toppings. "It's nice to see that some things haven't changed. Still trying to  pass for a guy I see."</p><p>"What do you mean trying?" Ukyo  retorted. "I think I pull it off fairly well. However I notice that some things  have changed. Your Japanese has improved, a lot."</p><p>Shampoo nodded her head in  thanks and then didn't say much else for several minutes as she worked her way  through the okonomiyaki that Ukyo served up and the chef/ martial artist's  attention was taken up by several other customers. Most of them elected to eat  on the go though, so by the time Shampoo finished, it was just her, Ukyo and  the yattai's owner again.</p><p>The yattai owner looked at his  watch and then said in a creaky voice. "Looks like it's closin' time."</p><p>"So early?" Ukyo asked,  surprised.</p><p>The owner nodded. "Always close  early on a Friday. A man needs some time to call his own. Thank you once again  for your help today." He reached into his cash drawer and counted out several  notes into Ukyo's hand.</p><p>"I can't accept this," she  insisted, trying to give it back. "This is your yattai, not mine."</p><p>"And without your help today, I  probably would have been swamped," the old man replied. "Take it. You deserve  it. I've got more than enough money to last me until I die, so don't worry  about it. I do this because I want to, not because I have to."</p><p>Ukyo bowed so deeply that her  ponytail fell forward over her head. "Thank you very much."</p><p>"It's no problem," the man  insisted. "Now I can tell that you and your friend have a lot of catching up to  do, so scoot." He made shooing motions with his hands before turning and  securing the rest of the items on the yattai.</p><p>Ukyo bent down and retrieved her  bandoleer of throwing spatulas and her oversized battler spatula from a drawer  under the yattai and slung both over her shoulder, adjusting them until they  sat right. The she straightened up and she and Shampoo started walking, saying  nothing for several moments. "So, what brings you back to Japan?" Ukyo finally  asked.</p><p>"Unfinished business," Shampoo  replied casually. "I'm sure you know what I mean. It's what drew you back from  your attempt to introduce the rest of the world to okonomiyaki, isn't it?"</p><p>Ukyo shrugged. "I could say no,  but I'd be lying. I don't like having issues left unresolved and I think now's  the time to resolve them."</p><p>"You're assuming that we get  lucky and run into everyone in Nerima," Shampoo pointed out. "I know Kasumi  still lives there with her father, as does Great-grandmother, but everyone else  left, either before us or not that long afterwards."</p><p>"They'll be there," Ukyo assured  her. "Call it a gut feeling, or an instinct if you want, but I know they'll be  there. And don't tell me you don't have the same feeling either. Somehow, I  don't think you'd be back in Japan if you didn't."</p><p>There was silence for several  long minutes as they continued to walk, but this time it was Shampoo who broke  the conversational impasse. "I'm sorry," she said.</p><p>Ukyo was so surprised she  stopped dead in her track. "What?"</p><p>"I'm sorry," Shampoo repeated.  "Towards the end I was behaving very badly and I owe both you and Akane  apologies for the way I acted. My actions were not those of an honourable  warrior and while I can not take back what I did, I can at least attempt to  make amends."</p><p>Ukyo was silent for several  seconds, digesting that, before blowing out a long, gusty breath and resuming  her walk. "You're not the only one who should apologise. My behaviour was not  too admirable either. So I'll accept your apology if you'll accept mine."</p><p>"Fair enough," Shampoo agreed.  "Now to change the topic to more immediate concerns, where were you planning on  spending the night. I for one would prefer to spend the evening under a roof,  preferably somewhere with air conditioning."</p><p>Ukyo rubbed her chin  thoughtfully for several moments as she walked, holding her head at just the  right angle for the sun to reflect of her shades. "The way I see it we have  several options. First, we can get on a train to Nerima right now and hope to  find someplace to spend the night before it gets too late. Or we can try and  find some place closer and head to Nerima in the morning, which is my personal  preference. Exactly where to stay depends on how much money you're willing to  spend. I've got enough that I can afford to indulge myself for one night, but  what about you?"</p><p>"Money is not an issue," Shampoo  said, "at least not for one night, or even for five nights if it really came to  that."</p><p>Ukyo grinned. "I know just the  place then. Follow me."</p><p>Intrigued, Shampoo followed Ukyo  closely. She was somewhat surprised when the chef led her away from the  high-rise buildings that contained the normal luxury hotels and into the  shopping district. They eventually came to a lingerie shop that Ukyo entered  without even pausing. Shampoo frowned slightly in puzzlement and then head on in  herself. The garments on display ranged from mildly titillating, to risqué and  down right scandalous. The store also seemed to contain quite a large number of  unusual items and Shampoo paused at a rather skimpy g-string that looked to be  made from gold lamé. The shop was also larger than it seemed from the outside,  and when Shampoo reached the back, Ukyo was already talking animatedly with the  girl behind the counter.</p><p>The girl, who appeared to be no  more than about sixteen, looked up at Shampoo's approach and asked Ukyo, "Is  this her?" is a voice more mature than her appearance suggested.</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>"The one you called the 'purple  haired Amazon cat-bitch from hell' when we first met?"</p><p>Ukyo flushed at that. "You had  to bring that up, didn't you. I wasn't exactly looking at things clearly at the  time."</p><p>"Don't worry," Shampoo said. "I  called you worse, and be thankful it doesn't translate or your hair would be  standing on end. I left that all behind years ago."</p><p>"Then allow me to introduce  myself. I am Iwata Sayoko, the proprietor of this establishment. If you have  any problems, just ask for me and I will do my best to solve it. For payment I  accept Japanese yen, Chinese Yuan, American dollars, British pounds, Euro and  most other currencies, all major credit cards and precious metals, valued at  current market value. Jewellery and other such valuable are only accepted if  you also have a certified valuation within the last twelve months. Is there any  difficulty with that?"</p><p>Shampoo shook her head, a little  stunned and wondering exactly where Ukyo had led her, for this was obviously  not an average lingerie shop.</p><p>"Then please, follow me." Sayoko  ushered them behind the counter and back through a screen of beads into what  Shampoo assumed was the staff room. It contained several lockers set flush into  the wall and their doors wood panelled, a low table surrounded by what had to  be the most comfortable looking chairs Shampoo had ever laid eyes on and there  was a top of the line coffee maker on the counter next to the sink. Sayoko led  them through a door opposite the screen and down a spiral staircase that seemed  to go down several stories before stopping and opening out into room with  carpets so thick and luxurious, Shampoo sank up to her ankles, and furnished  with several chairs and divans that looked even more comfortable than the ones  upstairs. In the centre of the room was a circular desk, manned by a woman and  an albino man, both around their mid twenties.</p><p>"Emi," Sayoko called out,  causing the woman to look up. "We have two guests for the night. Please arrange  rooms for them." With that the woman, who Shampoo was beginning to suspect was  nowhere near as young as she looked, left and Emi came out from behind the desk  to greet them. "Welcome to Bright Haven," she said, bowing. "If you will please  follow me, I will show you to your rooms."</p><p>She led them to one of the doors  on the wall opposite the staircase, ushering Ukyo through one, indicating for  Shampoo to wait. Shampoo started slightly when she realised the Emi had seven  fingers instead of the usual five, but she had seen stranger. It was only a  minute or so until Emi returned and ushered Shampoo through another door. It  opened onto a short hallway that angled down slightly and terminated in a  single door. Emi opened it and Shampoo's jaw almost dropped in surprise. The  room was the very definition of luxury, with a canopied bed big enough to sleep  a dozen with room to spare at the very centre.</p><p>"If you desire anything, please  ring the bell," Emi said, gesturing to an old-fashioned hand bell on the table  next to the door. "We hope you enjoy your stay at Bright Haven." And with that  she left, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Shampoo knew then and there,  without quite realsing how she knew, that Bright Haven was so far from the  ordinary that most people wouldn't believe it existed, even if you showed them.  For a brief moment she wondered exactly what Ukyo had gotten her into, and then  relaxed. What ever it was, she planned to enjoy it to the full while she could  and upon the morrow both she and Ukyo would head to Nerima to finally sort out  matters that had been left behind eight years ago.</p><p>And so they gathered. They had  wandered to the far corners of the globe and undergone trials and tribulations,  known joy and sorrow, experienced both thrilling triumph and bitter defeat and  all had grown, both as martial artists and as human beings. Now they returned  the place where it had all began, where they had first come together, friend  and foe, enemy and ally alike. Of course their number would not be complete  with out the Wild Horse and Ranma too travelled to Nerima, dark hair glinting  in the moonlight and sea spray flecking his cheeks, though not enough to  activate the curse, as the boat he was on pulled into Tokyo Bay. He knew that  he was running late, though he could not say how he knew, but he knew that the  others were ahead of him. But that did not matter, he would be there when the  time came. What would happen when they were all together again, he did not know  but finding out promised to be interesting.</p><p>End  Part 1</p>
