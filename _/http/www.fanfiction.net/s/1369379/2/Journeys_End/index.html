</div><p><u>Ranma:</u></p><p><u>Journey's End:</u></p><p><u>Part 2</u></p><p>The Tendo Dojo awoke to sounds that had not been  heard within its walls for quite some time, the sound of a vigorous work out by  a martial artist of impressive skill. Kasumi and Tofu, both early risers by inclination,  were not that put out with their unusual manner of their waking, but both  Kazuma and Soun, neither of who were morning people by preference, still looked  half asleep when they had all gathered to find out just who was making the  noise. As the only resident of the Tendo dojo not present, it was obvious that  Akane was the source of the noise, though it took a few moments for the  memories of Akane's return the previous day to percolate through Soun's sleep  addled mind. When he finally did remember, he led the way through the house to  the dojo to further the investigation.</p><p>What greeted them when they arrived was not quite any  of them expected. While none of them doubted Akane's pronouncements about her  improved skill, it wasn't until quite that moment that the full reality  actually sunk in. In the true spirit of the Anything Goes School, Akane flowed  from style as she blazed her way through the forms, a skin tight, blazing red  battle aura sheathing her limbs as she went through the motions as close to  perfect as was humanly possible. Every so often the performance was punctuated  by sharp sound that was somewhere between a hard exhalation and an outright  yell, accompanied by a brief flare from her battle aura. Kazuma, Kasumi, Tofu  and Soun stood there, entranced for several minutes until Akane came to a  blinding halt, her aura blinking to nothing.</p><p>There was an awed silence for several moments till  Kazuma made his opinion known with a reverent exclamation of, "Sugoi!" That  bought a brief round of laughter as Kazuma continued, "Can you teach me how to  do that Aunt Akane?"</p><p>"I thought you wanted to be a doctor," Akane said as  she walked over to her family, a grin on her face. "You can't be both a doctor  and a martial artist."</p><p>"Tou-san is!" Kazuma stated with the certainty that  only youth can bring.</p><p>"I'm afraid not Kazuma," Tofu said, shaking his head  sadly at his son. "Not to that degree. That requires a dedication too great to  work a medical degree around."</p><p>Kazuma looked crestfallen for a moment, but then  looked up at Akane again hopefully. "But you can still teach me Aunt Akane?"</p><p>"As much as you're willing to learn," Akane told her  nephew solemnly as she crouched down to ruffle his hair.</p><p>Soun smiled at the thought of his grandson helping to  carry on the Tendo School, but inside his mind was going over what he had just  seen. Even if he was a bit out of practise, he was still a martial artist of no  small skill but after that last display, he knew that Akane had surpassed him.  If it came to an all out fight, he would probably be able to last a few  minutes, since a man does not study under Happosai for years without picking up  a few tricks to keep his skin intact, but there was no doubt in Soun's mind  that in a fight between himself and his youngest daughter, he would not be the  victor. While the thought was somewhat disheartening, it also made him glad,  for he knew that whatever happened now, the Tendo School would remain strong  for another generation.</p><p>He was broken out of his revere when he heard the words  he had been dreading ever since Akane has returned. "Let me help you with  breakfast Onee-san."</p><p>Soun, Tofu and Kasumi froze in place, none of them  twitching so much as an eye lash. None of them has forgotten Akane's attempts  at helping in the kitchen before she left home. That is not something that one  forgets easily, no matter how much you want to. The tableau was broken when  Akane's face split in a wide grin and she doubled over at clutched at her  stomach as gales of laughter shook her body, while Kazuma looked between his  aunt, his grandfather and his parents and wondered just what was going on. "You  should see the looks on your faces," Akane managed to choke out before going  off in another fit of laughter.</p><p>"Come along Kazuma my boy," Soun said, deciding to  take pity on his grandson and enlighten him. "Let me tell you about the strange  and dangerous things that happen when your Aunt Akane enters the kitchen." That  only set Akane of further and Kasumi decided that discretion was the better  part of valour and fled to the kitchen, her sanctum sanctorum, to get  breakfast, leaving her husband to deal with the still laughing Akane.</p><p>"So Akane," Tofu said conversationally when Akane  finally got herself under control. "Tell me, what led to the realisation that  Ranma was telling the truth about your cooking, even if his phrasing was a  trifle indelicate?"</p><p>Akane grinned ruefully at that. "The fact that after  a week of eating my own cooking, I had to be admitted to hospital for severe  toxic shock," she admitted. "The doctor said the contents of my stomach were  more like a toxic waste dump instead of human digestive track. He made me swear  that the only kitchen utensil I would ever touch again is one I'm using to  eat."</p><p>At that it was Tofu's turn to laugh and Akane blushed  crimson. When Tofu calmed himself, he decided it was time to get a bit of her  own back and grill him about what he had done between leaving Nerima and  returning to marry Kasumi. She figured after being pumped for information the  previous day that turn about was fair play after all. That was broken up by  Kasumi announcing that breakfast was ready.</p><p>After all that was left of breakfast was few  scattered grains of rice stuck the edges of the bowls, Tofu readied himself for  a brief day at the clinic, Kazuma headed on his way to school and Kasumi headed  out to do some shopping, insisting that Akane accompany her. Unbeknownst to  them, at that same moment, Ryoga, who had been inventorying his pack and the  oversized pockets of his coat, decided that now was as good a time as any to  stock up on some of the items he was running low on. He wasn't planning on  going anywhere particularly soon, but spending most of his life on the road had  taught him that the old saw about mice, men and their plans was all too often  accurate. Of course, at the same time Ukyo and Shampoo boarded the train headed  for Nerima, the same train that Mousse and Konatsu were on, though the two  small groups had no idea of the others presence, being on carriages at the  opposite end of the train. It may have been quiet in Nerima for eight years,  but that only meant that the kami of chaos that ruled in the ward had eight  years of catching up to do and he wasn't going to waste a single minute.</p><p>Saturday being Saturday, the Nerima market was fairly  full, but Kasumi had been making her way through the crowded throngs for over a  decade and possessed an instinct for the ebb and flow of the crowd, almost like  some fishermen have an instinct for the wind and water at their favourite  fishing spot. This ensured that the grocery shopping was completed in short  order, and after a brief stop back at the dojo to drop the food off, Kasumi and  Akane were off again. While helping Akane settle back into her old room, Kasumi  had gotten a good look at her youngest sister's minimal wardrobe and insisted  on helping Akane expand it. After all, every girl deserved to have something  nice and all Akane's clothes were plain and meant for wear rather than show,  and all of them were showing the signs of hard living. So will she or nil she,  Akane found herself being guided around all the clothing stores that Nerima  possessed that might have something suitable for her.</p><p>Of course finding something appropriate proved to be  harder than even Kasumi had anticipated. While no one could doubt that Akane  was a woman, just by looking at her, over the years of her wandering she had  picked up a distinctive, sleek, muscular grace and that was what was causing  the problems. The vast majority of women's fashions weren't designed for women  who showed the same amount of muscular development that Akane did and  everything she tried on just looked wrong somehow. As Kasumi guided Akane to  yet another clothing store, she began to wonder if Akane would have to have  something specifically tailored if she didn't want to look odd in a dress. She  was so focused on her thoughts that she wasn't paying as much attention to her  surroundings as she normally did and so bumped into a very solid and immobile  slab of muscle as she turned a corner.</p><p>"I'm sorry miss, let me help you up," a deep voice  said from that massive chest and Kasumi looked up in surprise as that voice  triggered eight year old memories. Her eyes flicked up to the bandanna around  Ryoga's forehead and she smiled.</p><p>"It's good to see you again Ryoga-kun," she said as  she took his hand and climbed back to her feet.</p><p>"It's good to see you too Kasumi-san," Ryoga said.  "And you too Akane," he added, looking up and giving a slight internal sigh at  what he felt when looking at the former object of his affections. He had come  to realise long ago that he didn't truly love Akane, at least not in the  romantic sense and that he had clung to her because she was one of the few  people in his lonely existence that had been kind to him. Though he had given  up hope of her being his true love, part of him had always wondered, but those  questions were answered when he looked at her. What welled up inside him was  affection, warmth at seeing a friend one has not seen in a long time, and even  a faint hint of lust, for there was no questioning the fact that Akane was a  beautiful woman, but no true love.</p><p>Akane nodded in return and smiled slightly, but there  was a slightly fixed quality to it, and it didn't entirely reach her eyes.  "Ryoga," she said acknowledging his greeting with a nod of her head and though  she was cordial enough, Ryoga wondered exactly what she was still angry about  from since the last time they had seen each other. If it was what he thought it  was, he was most likely in trouble.</p><p>Nothing would come of it then though, for at that  moment a cheerful voice called out, "Well, well! If it isn't old home week!  Don't tell me you got lost for <i>eight  years</i> Ryoga!"</p><p>The voice triggered many memories and Kasumi, Akane  and Ryoga all turned to look at the speaker. That morning Mousse had elected to  wear a set of robes identical to his old ones, save for being made of slightly  finer, and more durable, material, so despite the eye patch and new hairstyle,  it took only a few seconds for him to be recognised.</p><p>"Mousse!" Akane blurted out in surprise, causing  several nearby heads to turn and stare, before their owners raced of to spread  the news. "What sort of coincidence can this be? You and Ryoga arriving back in  Nerima the day after I did."</p><p>"Actually, I arrived yesterday," Ryoga interjected.</p><p>"Details," Akane said, brushing the point away with a  wave of her hand. "My point's still valid."</p><p>"I don't believe there is any such thing as a  coincidence when it comes to Nerima Akane-san," Konatsu said, causing both  Ryoga and Akane to look very closely at her.</p><p>"Hang on," Ryoga said. "Didn't you use to be Ukyo  waitress?" he asked. "I'm afraid I've forgotten your name. I don't think we  were ever properly introduced."</p><p>"Kenzanin Konatsu," Konatsu supplied.</p><p>"Konatsu?" Akane asked in surprise. "I know you used  to cross-dress, but when did you become female?"</p><p>Briefly Konatsu outlined her encounter with the Musk,  making Ryoga snicker at the scheme. As she finished a new voice called out from  down the street. "Looks like we weren't too late after all!" and heads turned  to see Ukyo and Shampoo approaching.</p><p>When they actually made it to easy talking distance,  the conversation rapidly degenerated into repeated exclamations of disbelief at  how much they were pushing coincidence, even for Nerima, while Kasumi just  stood to one side and smiled. At the same time several blocks away Happosai was  making one of his occasional visits back to Nerima, his path marked by outraged  screams and women who had found themselves divested of one or more items of  underwear.</p><p>Grinning Happosai used his pipe to send an incensed  boyfriend who tried to stop him forcefully flying into a stone wall. It had  been a while since he had been to Nerima and it was better than he remembered  it being the last time. Ever since his eventual successor had left things had  seemed flat and lifeless and even liberating his silky darlings hadn't been as  much fun as it used to be. So he had moved on to greener pastures, returning  only occasionally to remind the ward that he was still around. But today,  things seemed so much sweeter and he was enjoying himself more than he had in  the past few years. He liberated a leopard print pair of panties and headed for  the rooftops, deciding that he should stash what he had already collected and  then come back for more later, as it was getting awkward to carry. He paused  for a moment and that was when he felt them.</p><p>Happosai had been around many years and had refined  his skills to incredible degrees and that was the only reason he sensed what he  did. Six immensely powerful auras, though damped down and kept under control.  Most ki adepts would have only been able to sense six auras, perhaps a little  more powerful than most, but nothing really out of the ordinary, but what set  Happosai apart from most was that he could since the hidden strength and  potential. Five of the six seemed familiar about as well, though he couldn't  quite place them. Still three of the individuals were definitely female and a  probable fourth was as well. That aura was a little strange, and better  shielded than the others, so it was hard to tell, but he decided that a few  more silky darlings couldn't hurt, especially when their wearers actually  promised to give him a challenge in liberating them. It was a prospect that he  just couldn't turn down.</p><p>With a cry of, "SWEETO!" he leapt across the  rooftops, crying out again every few leaps, looking forward to a bit of  excitement to lighten up an old man's life. Just as he crested the roof of one  of the building on the street that held his targets, he caught sight of them  and instantly realised why the auras were so familiar. He knew almost all of  them their, Akane, Ryoga, Mousse, Shampoo and Ukyo and the reason he hadn't  recognised their auras was because they were so much powerful than the last  time he had sensed them. His grin grew even broader as he leapt down with one  final, joyful cry.</p><p>That proved to be a mistake though. Even back when  they had been enemies, all of the so called Nerima Wrecking Crew had agreed on  one thing. Beating up Happosai was always a good thing, especially when he had  just been on one of his raiding sprees. They all remembered his voice quite  well too, so the instant they sensed his presence, they had been on guard and  when they heard him, five blazing battle auras sprang into existence, blazing,  fiery red for Akane, a light, goldish green for Ryoga, a shimmering violet for  Shampoo, a hard silvery white for Mousse and a rusty, almost blood red for  Ukyo, while Konatsu seemed to turn sideways while standing still and disappear.  Half an instant later five ki bolts, all of them aimed for the founding master  of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts and Lechery. Happosai hadn't been  expecting quite that response to his arrival and was caught off guard, but he  recovered quickly. He dodged three of the five ki bolts, but Ryoga's  greenish-gold bolt caught the bulging sack of his purloined lingerie,  scattering them everywhere and that distracted him just long enough that  Shampoo's attack caught him squarely in the chest and sent him flying  backwards. He recovered quickly and pushed off the wall as he hit it, but as he  reached the top of his arc, Happosai's finely tuned danger sense screamed a  warning at him. He looked up just in time to see an orange-gold sphere of ki  come hurtling down towards him, accompanied by a cry of "MOKOU TAKABISHA!"  before he was slammed into the ground and consciousness fled.</p><p>Ranma landed lightly on his feet to one side of the  now somnolent old panty thief, a wide grin on his face as he spread his arms  and said cheerfully, "Well, did you miss me?"</p><p>Cologne pogoed along the streets of Nerima for all  she was worth. She had just gotten word from the suddenly resurrected rumour  mill that not only had Ryoga returned, but so had Akane, Shampoo, Mousse, Ukyo  and Konatsu, but most importantly of all, Ranma was back. The person who had  informed her had also said that all of them were headed to the Tendo Dojo,  though he had not overheard the reasons. Still, Cologne saw no reason not to  go. She had closed up the shop and hung a sign that had not seen use for a long  time. 'Closed due to Ranma.' It was highly likely that all those gathered at  the Tendo Dojo had improved their skills in the martial arts during their long  absence and there was great potential for an outbreak of fighting in the  situation. Cologne had been bored ever since Shampoo left and with the  opportunity to view a battle like that one, she would fight her way through all  the gods of China and the kami of Japan to view it.</p><p>Of course when she got there, it proved to be rather  anti climactic. She exchanged brief greetings with Kasumi and was ushered into  the living room where the various returnees were not engaged in heated  arguments or displays of athletic violence as had been expected, but were  sitting down calmly drinking tea. There was tension there of course, obvious to  those who were expecting it, but no where near as bad as she had expected. What  also took Cologne back were the changes in some of their physical appearances,  especially Mousse, Akane and Shampoo. It took her several seconds to recognise  the youngest Tendo and Mousse, as Akane's tan and sun bleached hair and  Mousse's new hairstyle and eye patch altered their appearances in subtle, but  striking ways, but Cologne's mind took several seconds to accept what she saw  with Shampoo. A Joketsu warrior, even the rare males like Mousse, never cut  their hair except in times of great dishonour (or the beginning of split ends,  but then only as little as possible) and Shampoo's neat, close clipped locks  just refused to register with Cologne's mental image of her  great-granddaughter.</p><p>Ranma was the first to notice Cologne's entrance,  which was fairly impressive, as his back was to her and she had entered  silently out of long habit. Without turning around he raised one hand in a  casual greeting. "Yo! Long time know see Old Ghoul!"</p><p>Despite herself Cologne had to laugh as everyone  turned their heads to look at her. No matter how much changed, it seemed  certain things would always remain the same. "Eight years to be more exact.  Actually, I'll have to check, but I think it's almost to the day."</p><p>"Almost," Ranma agreed, still not turning around. "So  what brings you here this fine day?"</p><p>A thousand things ran through Cologne's mind as she  tried to decide on an answer to that. She was aware of Ukyo, Akane and  Konatsu's casual interest, which caused the question of where Konatsu had  gotten Nyannichaun water from to flit through her mind, Mousse's more intent  scrutiny and the way Shampoo was not quite looking directly at her. Then she  thought about her village back in China, the house she had lived in for nearly  a century before coming to Japan, the reactions of her fellow elders on the  council and many, many other things. Finally after a pause that seemed like an  eternity, but in reality was probably little more than a few seconds, she said,  "Actually, I came to ask if you would care to talk. We have much that needs to  be discussed and thought that you might want to get it out of the way before  dealing with… other matters."</p><p>"Sounds like a good idea," Ranma admitted after a few  moments thought. "Is there anything that you need to do right now?"</p><p>"Nothing that can't keep," she said. "Though if it is  inconvenient for you, I'm sure another time can be arranged."</p><p>Ranma paused again, obviously thinking and inwardly  Cologne cheered. She knew that Ranma had a brain but she had despaired of him  ever learning to use it, at least before opening his mouth and just blurting  things out. It was a problem many martial artists she knew had, to one degree  or another. In combat they were trained to act and react as fast as possible,  not sit around and think things through and that often carried over into other  aspects of their life, which in some instances could be a good thing, but it  could also be a bad thing, as in Ranma's case. He was still thinking when he  caught a both Akane and Mousse nodding almost imperceptibly, joined a little  later by Ukyo. This encouragement seemed to make up his mind and he replied.  "Now is a good as time as any I suppose."</p><p>He rose with his feet with what Cologne knew to be  deliberate casualness and turned to face her. He was very little changed from  the young man that Cologne had known eight years ago, physically at least. He was  a little taller, and had acquired a slight tan, though not to the same degree  as Akane and his blue eyes were as bright and piercing as ever. His shirt was a  little fancier than those he had favoured back when he left, with a thin border  of intricate embroidery on the cuff and down the front, but it was the same  basic style. "Shall we go?" he asked.</p><p>"After you," Cologne said, letting Ranma lead the way  out. Once they were on the footpath, Ranma looked longingly at the fences, but  refrained from jumping up on them. Both were silent as they walked, Ranma  taking a random, meandering route through the streets. Finally Ranma broke the  silence. "Do you still mean for me to marry Shampoo?" he asked, his tone quiet  and serious.</p><p>Cologne had been expecting that question in one form  or another. "Were the choice mine to make, I would tell you that the choice is  yours to make, though if you do choose to wed my great-granddaughter, I would  certainly have no objection."</p><p>"You said, if the choice were your's," Ranma replied.  "That implies a but lurking somewhere at the end of the statement."</p><p>"Very true. My position as Elder allows some leeway  in offering incentives to encourage you, 'sweetening the pot' so to speak, but  my position also means that I must uphold the laws of the tribe and those same  laws demand that you marry Shampoo."</p><p>"I would have thought that an Elder would have more  choice in the matter, Ranma said, his voice tinted with surprise.</p><p>"Most would," Cologne confirmed, "but unfortunately, the  exact opposite pertains. Our people have never been large in number, but we  have survived throughout millennia, with very little influence by the tides of  change, but that is coming to a close. Until the twentieth century our skills  as warriors and the secret techniques of our tribe meant that even if we could  not beat back an invading army, any victory they achieved would by Pyrrhic at  best and the presence of the Musk would doom any army that badly depleted.  Little as we like them, the mutual proximity of we and the Musk has played a  large part in the survival of both groups. But now there are modern weapons  that would allow the government in Beijing to wipe us out as an effective  fighting force with the push of a button. Between that and the lure of the  comforts that modern technology offers, comfort that is sadly lacking in  Qinghai Province, the tribe threatens to simply… dissolve and it is only be  keeping to our laws that can be stopped and as an elder it is my duty to set an  example by upholding the law. If I were to so openly disregard it, that would  send the Joketsu on a downhill slide that would see us scattered to the winds  and lucky to be even a footnote in history and I will not knowingly be party to  doing that. So I am more constrained by our laws than even the lowliest male  back in the village."</p><p>"A point I hadn't considered," Ranma admitted. "But  do you not also make the law? Old laws can change and new laws made and I doubt  that the Jokestu survived as long as you say they have without changing with  the times when necessary."</p><p>"True," Cologne admitted. "The records are almost  indecipherable and the scribes are in a running battle to render them in more  modern script before they are complete lost to the ravages of time, but if you  are willing to put in the care and effort, you can read records detailing laws  being changed, and even overturned entirely, throughout our history. However, I  am but one Elder, and it takes the majority of the council to agree to change  or repeal a law. If I encounter a situation that is not covered by the law, I  do have the authority to set an interim law on my own, but that is subject to  ratification and modification by the council. I have also argued that the law  should be changed, but my fellow elders will not even consider it. It is true  of many people that the faster the world around them changes, the more they  hold on to the old and familiar, and the older one becomes, the truer that is."</p><p>"Then I must ask this question," Ranma said solemnly,  his voice gaining a slight edge to it. "By what authority do your laws apply to  me? I am not Joketsu, I'm not even Chinese! So what gives you the right to tell  me I must obey your laws?" Though on a tight leash, the anger in Ranma's voice  was quite clear at this point, but it was equally clear that he wasn't  directing it at Cologne. Rather his anger was with the situation that they were  both in and Cologne made sure to keep that in mine when she answered him.</p><p>"The right given by hubris, arrogance and fear," she  replied, deadly serious, making Ranma deflate slightly when he realised that,  though she might not be on his side, she at least sympathised with his  position. "For centuries we thought of ourselves as superior to all other  humans in the land, equalled only by the Musk, who by their breeding practices  aren't purely human anymore and the Houzanjin, who are more clearly not human.  Their inability to conquer us fuelled a belief that we were somehow better than  they and could impose our laws on them by the philosophy of might makes right.  Now that the tables are turned and they can wipe us off the face of the Earth,  it has only fuelled that belief, that somehow these powerful weapons make them  less than us. And so we insist even more strongly that outsiders follow out  laws than we used to."</p><p>Ranma whistled. "You've given this a lot of thought,"  he said admiringly. "You never mentioned any of this eight years ago."</p><p>"Would you have listened?"</p><p>"To be truthful almost certainly not. I didn't have  the patience for this sort of thing," Ranma said with a shrug.</p><p>"Then I will also be truthful and admit that though  the idea had occurred to me, I had not given it such careful thought then,"  Cologne said. "The sheer culture shock of coming from our tiny village in the  mountains to one of the largest metropolises in the world is what made it occur  to me, but one does not question how they have lived their entire life easily  or quickly. Though I do take it from all these question that you don't plan to  marry my great-granddaughter?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "No offence intended to  Shampoo, but we just never clicked, not like that. Of course, things could be  different. We haven't talked much, but she's changed a lot since last I saw  her."</p><p>"As have you Ranma," Cologne said, causing Ranma to  blush.</p><p>"All I did was learn to keep my mouth shut and listen  occasionally. But still, I cannot accept the terms you offer, no matter how  much you 'sweeten the pot.' Even if I'm accepted as a male warrior, can you  honestly tell me that I won't always be second to the women, no matter how  skilled I am?"</p><p>"Truthfully, no."</p><p>"And that I cannot accept. I once made the mistake of  thinking women always second to men, then fate goes around and makes me one  half of the time. I've learned that lesson, but I cannot accept that sort of  situation."</p><p>"I fear that leaves us with few options then,"  Cologne said. "I can think of only one other thing that would allow for all  concerned to escape with their honour intact, though I fear it would do little  good in this situation."</p><p>"You never know," Ranma said with a shrug. "Even if  we can't think of something, we could always Doc Tofu or Kasumi for help. What  is it?"</p><p>"The Trial of Refusal. When a member of the tribe  disagrees with a decision of the council, it is their right to challenge one of  the elders to one on combat and should they prove victorious, the decision is  over turned. It also has the added benefit of having already being extended to  outsiders who have fallen within what the Council sees as our sphere of  influence, such as yourself. It has only ever been used once, but the precedent  does exist." She turned to face Ranma and was dismayed to see that his eyes had  suddenly come to life, burning with eagerness.</p><p>"It sounds like an option," he said with a grin.</p><p>Cologne frowned at him reprovingly. "You have not  seen all that I am capable of Ranma. You and I know both know you've seen only  a fraction of what I know. If you lose, you will have no choice to return to  China and become Shampoo's husband and there is nothing I will be able to do to  help you."</p><p>Ranma's eyes were now positively glowing. "No  disrespect Elder, I have beaten you once before, even if it was under the  influence of the Neko-ken and I have not been idle the past eight years. You  yourself taught me the Amiguriken and Hiryu Shoten Ha and you saw me develop  the Mouko Takabisha, all in the space of less than a year. You may have the  advantage of experience, but I would have the advantages of height, weight and  reach and the adaptability of the Anything Goes School. I doubt the outcome  would be as forgone as you believe."</p><p>Cologne narrowed her eyes and glared at Ranma, who  met her stare levelly. In anyone else, she would have dismissed those  statements as youthful arrogance, but despite what many others thought, Ranma  had never been truly arrogant. Justifiably proud of his accomplishments and  abilities, but the problem was that those were great indeed for someone as  young as him and it was the same now. It was not pride or ego that made Ranma  speak those words, but a sincere belief in their truth and that made Cologne  pause. All too often she had seen Ranma not merely surpass, but transcend his  limitations and the memory came unbidden of how shaken Herb, Dragon Prince of  the Musk had been at his defeat by Ranma and the awesome shock that she had  felt herself when she discovered that Ranma had not merely bested Saffron, but  actually killed the Phoenix King. With eight years more experience behind him,  he might just very well have a point.</p><p>That wasn't the only consideration thought. As much  as she tried to ignore that small part of herself, Cologne was a martial artist  at heart herself and that part of her hungered at the thought of a challenge.  Teaching had been a rewarding experience, but it had been too long since Cologne  had done that seriously for many years either and she found herself longing for  the thrill of battle. "Are you really willing to accept the risk?" she asked.</p><p>"Ready, willing and able," Ranma replied, a slight  grin on his face. "If you can see no other way, then this has to be it."</p><p>"Then, Saotome Ranma, Heir to the Saotome School of  Anything Goes Martial Arts, I, Cologne, Warrior and Matriarch of the  Jokusetzoku, accept your challenge to the Trial of Refusal."</p><p>The assembled martial artists watched Ranma and  Cologne leave in solemn silence. No one had to say anything to know that the  departing pair had just taken an important first step in resolving all the  issues that had brought them back to Nerima. Finally when they heard the front  door close, Ryoga spoke up and broke the silence. "Shouldn't you be going with  them Shampoo?" he asked.</p><p>Shampoo smiled sadly. "I don't think so. Ranma must  make his choice for himself and what is still between us is a matter of tribal  law and that is rightly the province of an Elder. He and Great Grandmother must  work this out between themselves, without my interference. I do hope that Great  Grandmother can figure out a way to free him from tribal law."</p><p>Everyone simply turned and looked at Shampoo with disbelieving  stares. "Does this mean that you intend to give up on Ranma-san, Shampoo-san,"  Konatsu asked in a small voice, which earned the kunoichi a quelling glare.</p><p>"Do I look that silly?" she asked with a hint of heat  to her voice. "There is no way I am letting a catch like him get away without  even making an attempt!"</p><p>"But you just said you don't want Ranma to be your  husband by tribal law anymore," Akane objected, a little confused.</p><p>"I don't," Shampoo said. "If I get Ranma, I want it  to be of his own free will. I want him to choose me because he loves me, not  because he's forced to."</p><p>"Now there's a sentiment I can agree with," Ukyo said  enthusiastically. "Among other things I've been doing, I've had a long talk  with my father and he's agreed to dissolve my engagement to Ranma, on the  condition that Genma provide some form of restitution for the stolen yattai.  Anyone got any idea what a panda skin rug goes for these days?"</p><p>That earned a round of laughter and an offer of aid  in collecting said item from Mousse. When the laughter died down, an  uncomfortable silence once again descended over the room. Finally Akane decided  to break it and cleared her throat. "Um, Ryoga, could you come with me into the  dojo? There's something I'd like to discuss with you. In private."</p><p>"Okay," Ryoga said, a little uncertainly, as there  was a slightly fixed quality to Akane's voice that suggested he wasn't going to  enjoy the conversation. He also has a sinking feeling in his gut what the  conversation was going to be about. It was something he had been dreading but  it was also something that had to be done, so he got to his feet and followed  Akane to the dojo. She opened the door and waved him in.</p><p>He walked in and surveyed the dojo, noting that it  had changed little, merely that the repairs weren't as obviously new as they  had been last time he was there. He heard the door slide shut behind him and he  turned to face Akane and his danger sense gave him less than a split second's  warning before the ki charged backhand caught him across the face, knocking him  backwards and actually lifting his feet off the floor with the force of the  blow. "You perverted bastard!" Akane yelled at him, her battle aura a fiery red  as a forward kick caught him in the ribs, knocking him back down and sliding  along the floor. "You little swine! I should have had you neutered like Nabiki  suggested!" Much as Ryoga admitted he was wrong for what he had done as P-chan,  there was a limit to how much physical abuse he was willing to take and he  blocked the uppercut that would have put him through the roof, his arms  tingling with the discharged ki from the strike. Still having her physical  attack halted didn't stop Akane's verbal tirade. "And to play on Ranma's honour  by making him keep your dirty little secret!" Even blocking didn't stop Ryoga  from skidding back nearly a metre from the kick that accompanied the statement.</p><p>Akane continued in that vein for sometime, and to  Ryoga it seemed to dredge up every single of the moments that shamed him most.  He made no attempt to defend himself, verbally at least as though her language  may have been slightly intemperate; everything Akane said was the truth.  Physically was another matter entirely and by the time Akane calmed down  Ryoga's forearms were aching from so many repeated blocks and his right cheek  was throbbing in time to his heartbeat from the first blow, though it didn't  feel like anything was broken. Finally Akane expended her fury with a driving  elbow that slipped through his defences and sent him flying back once again and  a shout of, "If you ever think of doing something like that again, I'm going to  tear of your balls, carve them into rosettes and serve them to you on a silver  platter!" That said she went and flopped down in a corner tried to catch her  breath.</p><p>"I am sorry," Ryoga said softy, as he pulled himself  back up off the floor and into a position. "I did many things that I am ashamed  of, but none more than that, save perhaps forcing Ranma to keep my secret."</p><p>"I should hope so," Akane shot back, but most of the  heat was gone out of her voice.</p><p>"I just hope you can forgive me for what I did? It  was inexcusable and I don't know how to make it up to you. All I can do is  offer you my most sincere forgiveness."</p><p>"I forgave you along time ago Ryoga," Akane said  after a few moments of silence. "A wise man told me that to hold onto a grudge  for so long can only bring unhappiness to myself and sorrow to everyone around  me." She looked up. "Though I think that you came to that conclusion yourself."</p><p>Ryoga shrugged. "If I hadn't I probably would have  wind up creating a Perfect Shi Shi Hokodan that would have left me little more  than a greasy smear on some rock. But if you weren't holding a grudge, what was  that just about?"</p><p>"I needed to get the last of it out of my system and  I wanted to make my feelings on the matter perfectly clear. If I had been  really mad, you would have been going through the walls, whether you blocked or  not."</p><p>"Well, I wouldn't be able to do it again, even if I  wanted. My curse is cured."</p><p>Akane's voice was very soft and serious when she  replied. "You'll forgive me if I asked for proof. I'm did forgive you Ryoga,  but I cannot forget what you did either." She raised her head and looked  directly into Ryoga's eyes. "I trusted you Ryoga, and you betrayed that trust.  My mind believes that you have changed and truly do regret what you did, but my  heart does not. It will be a long time before I can trust you again Ryoga, if  ever."</p><p>With that she got up and left the dojo and it was  only because she always kept her senses enhanced with her ki that she heard the  soft, "I understand," as she slid the door shut after herself.</p><p>Akane thought about rejoining the others briefly, but  her nerves were still a little too jangled for that and she decided to tryout  Ranma's favourite place for solitude while he was at the Tendo Dojo. She  slipped out the front door, and turned a standing jump into a three hundred and  sixty degree back flip that landed her lightly on the roof. It gave her an  excellent vantage point to watch the coming and goings in the surrounding  streets and she looked on with interest as people went about their business.  She felt her heart start to beat a little faster when she recognised Ranma  returning, without Cologne.</p><p>Her grin upon seeing him took on an appearance that  wasn't entirely innocent. She would freely admit that whatever else she thought  about Ranma, his body was enough to send thrills of excitement down her spine  and she had also borrowed some of the negatives from Nabiki's collection so she  could have a few choice photos to take with her. The years had been kind to  Ranma as well. Though his physical appearance was less drastically changed than  many of the others, there were subtle signs of how time and training had  refined his already impressive physique. Akane was also honest enough, though  only to herself, that she was curious as to what changes time had wrought to  his female form and that not all of those photos had been of Ranma's male form.</p><p>Turning away before her thoughts became to  laviscious, Akane looked the down the other direction and her eyes widened in  surprise. That hair colour was too rare in Japan to leave many other options,  and Akane didn't know any other women in Nerima who always wore a kimono and  carried a cloth wrapped katana everywhere with them. Apparently she wasn't the  only one to recognise Saotome Nodoka and she snuck a quick glance at Ranma who  was frozen dead in his tracks with surprise as the Saotome Matriarch walked  calmly up to the door of the Tendo Dojo. Just as she was about to push open the  gate, Ranma shook off his paralysis and sprinted forward, with a cry of,  "Kaa-san!"</p><p>Nodoka turned around and gasped in surprise, hands  flying to her mouth as her katana clattered to the ground and Akane decided it  was time to head back down off the roof. Things were about to get interesting  again.</p><p>Authors Notes:</p><p>That was an evil place to  leave it, wasn't it? ^_^</p><p>I'd like to thank everyone  for the comments on the first chapter. I'm glad you liked it and I hope you  like this one just as much. I'd also like to thank Takahashi-sensei for  creating such a wonderful series and then giving us fanfic writers so much room  to play around with. Domo Arigatou!</p><p>Also a few things I'd like to  add that I probably should have said after the first chapter. On a note of  spelling, as it says in my profile, I'm Australian and our spelling conventions  are actually a mix of British English and American English, so if you note a  British spelling, such as c-o-l-o-u-r and an American spelling such as  r-e-c-o-g-n-i-z-e in the same work, neither is a typo, they're both accepted  here. As for the frequency of updates, I'll try to make it as often as  possible, but that is both contingent on outside conditions and my muse.</p><p>Next time: Ranma gets reaccquainted  with his parents as everyone else tries to settle back into Nerima. And the old  saw, 'The more things change, the more they stay the same,' is proved correct  as the Kuno Siblings make their reapperance, as deluded and crazy ever. Hope to  see you there!</p>
