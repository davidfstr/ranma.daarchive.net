</div>The Dragon and the Ghost<p>Part 17<p>Reunion.<p>++++++++++++<p>"We're almost there," said Ranma with a light smirk on his face as<br/>he turned towards Akane.<p>She had her arms folded across her chest and was glaring at him<br/>distastefully as they walked. "Good, then I can kill you."<p>"You can try at any rate," replied the boy with a small chuckle.<br/>"I doubt if you're dumb enough to try, especially with the others<br/>around. If you aren't careful, I'm afraid I'll have to tie you up<br/>again."<p>Akane growled and turned her head away.<p>"There's a good girl," said Ranma cheerfully as he continued<br/>walking.<p>A few moments later they came upon a worn looking cabin deep in<br/>the woods. A column of smoke rose from the rickety looking chimney.<br/>Ranma grinned back at Akane for a moment and walked up to the front<br/>door. He began to bang on it harshly.<p>"Open up in the name of the Emperor! Come out now! You'll not<br/>escape!"<p>Akane stared at him in shock for a moment as he tried not to<br/>giggle at the noises that started to come from inside the cabin.<br/>Finally, he kicked the door in and waltzed inside confidently.<p>"Where is the Kajakan!"<p>Akane blinked as a blast of white light came from inside the<br/>cabin. Ranma sailed back out the door, and landed on his back in the<br/>dirt a few yards away from her. "Dolt."<p>Ranma sat up, his body was smoking and he had a dazed look in his<br/>eyes. "Whoa. Kinda forgot about that damn spear."<p>"Ranchan? Are you all right?" said Ukyo as she peered out the door<br/>of the cabin cautiously. A moment later, both she and Shampoo rushed<br/>out to his side.<p>"Wow, you almost got yourself killed. That was pretty funny<br/>though," said Shampoo cheerfully as she grabbed his arm.<p>"You jackass! What the hell were you thinking?" snapped Ukyo as<br/>she belted him over the head with the spear. "I could have killed<br/>you!" She promptly grabbed his other arm.<p>"Ouch, my head," muttered Ranma.<p>"Hey! What are you doing! Let my Ranchan go!" said Ukyo as she<br/>looked up at the elf girl opposite her.<p>"I don't see a brand on him," replied Shampoo curtly as she<br/>cuddled his arm a little harder.<p>"Look you hussy!" said Ukyo angrily.<p>"Will you two knock it off?" said Ryu lazily as he emerged from<br/>the cabin with a long wrapped bundle over his shoulder.<p>Akane snapped to life in an instant. "There it is!"<p>"Huh?" muttered Ryu dumbly, everyone else turned and watched the<br/>girl as she charged him angrily.<p>"Give that back to me you thief!" roared the girl.<p>Ryu merely smirked and spread his feet apart for a moment. "Don't<br/>move!"<p>The black knight staggered for a moment in surprise. "Huh?"<p>It was all Ryu needed, he jumped forward, slamming into her with<br/>his attack. Akane was thrown across the yard of the home, and came<br/>down rather roughly near a pile of firewood. "What an idiot."<p>"I warned her," commented Ranma from beside Ryu.<p>Shampoo and Ukyo blinked in surprise as they looked at their empty<br/>hands. Ranma had used the distraction to escape, leaving them sitting<br/>alone dumbly.<p>Akane staggered to her feet and glared at the pair bitterly.<p>"Do we really need to tie you up again?" said Ranma calmly as he<br/>watched her. "If you try for the Kajakan again before we're done with<br/>it, I will."<p>Akane snorted and turned her head away once again, she stood<br/>silently for a long moment before simply sitting down in the dust.<p>"We'll head back tomorrow," said Ranma calmly as he walked towards<br/>the cabin. "The two of us have had a hard journey, we need to rest<br/>before we go on."<p>++++++++++++<p>"Kiima," said Saffron as he sat on his throne in the great hall of<br/>the palace. Hundreds of dignitaries sat around him, silently.<p>"Yes my lord?" said the woman as she appeared before him and bowed<br/>deeply.<p>"How are the plans going?"<p>The bird woman smirked at him. "Perfectly."<p>"Heh, Lord Herb is unaware?"<p>"Of course not," said the woman with a slight bow of her head.<p>"Excellent," said Saffron with a slight chuckle. "You may leave me<br/>now."<p>Kiima bowed and vanished from in front of him.<p>+++++++++++++<p>In the shadows nearby, a lone figure stood hidden away from view.<br/>The long black cloak hid away all of her features. The bottom of her<br/>face was all that was visible, lit by a nearby torch that hung from<br/>the wall. She smiled lightly, her lips painted with a dark purple<br/>lipstick. "Most interesting," she commented just before she melted<br/>away into the darkness.<p>++++++++++<p>Late the next day, the party finally stood overlooking the forest.<p>"It's over," said Ranma with a heavy sigh as he looked out over<br/>the treetops.<p>Akane frowned and looked down at the forest for a moment. She said<br/>nothing, but her thoughts were much darker. "No, it has only begun."<p>"Come on, let's get this over with," said Ryu as he started<br/>forward.<p>Ryoga grunted dwarfishly in agreement and started to follow after<br/>the group, or so he thought. "Eh! Where'd ya go?"<p>Ranma pulled on his hear as he dumped a flask of water over his<br/>head, changing instantly. She then shook off the water and forced the<br/>dwarf in the right direction.<p>Ukyo frowned as she looked over at Akane for a moment. "What are<br/>you planning Ranchan?" she muttered under her breath. The boy had made<br/>no attempt to hide where they were going. He had practically led the<br/>Emperor to the elven village personally if she was allowed to live<br/>now.<p>Suddenly Ranma stopped cold and looked at the forest silently for<br/>a long moment. Ryu moved up beside him with a scowl on his face.<p>"What is it?" asked Shampoo in confusion. She looked over at the<br/>forest in confusion. A huge flock of birds soared into the sky above<br/>from the treetops. "Wow," said the elf girl in wonder as she watched<br/>them sail over her head, many passed almost close enough for her to<br/>touch.<p>"Ryu..." said Ranma quietly.<p>"You too, huh?" muttered the boy in answer.<p>"Yeah. I've got a bad feeling about this," said the redhead<br/>quietly as she glanced back at the group.<p>"Let go o' me ear!" snapped Ryoga from beside Ranma, completely<br/>ruining the serious moment.<p>"Oops, I forgot," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"Let's get going," said Ryu to the whole group.<p>+++++++++++<p>The village was silent, it was early evening, and the sun was<br/>slowly sinking below the horizon. The group walked through the empty<br/>streets and wandered towards the palace.<p>"Is it always this quiet?" muttered Akane to herself as she eyed<br/>the area cautiously.<p>"It's dinner time," said Shampoo with a shrug.<p>"Let's just get this over with," said Ranma coolly as she stepped<br/>towards the palace. "I'd like to get paid and forget about this job."<p>"Long overdue," agreed Ryu with a small nod.<p>The group walked into the great tree that served as the palace.<br/>Shampoo moved into the lead position as they walked up to the throne<br/>room. Ryu handed her the Kajakan and nodded grimly.<p>"See you guys later," muttered Ranma as she vanished into thin<br/>air.<p>"What?" stammered Ryoga. "Come back coward!"<p>"Shut up," said Ryu as he smacked the dwarf on the back of his<br/>head. The group opened the great doors that would lead them to<br/>Cologne's throne and walked into the room slowly.<p>"Welcome," said the cold sounding voice.<p>"What?" stammered Akane in shock as she stepped forward.<p>Herb was sitting in the throne, lounging rather lazily as he<br/>watched them enter the room. "I believe you are bringing something to<br/>me?" He put out his hand and opened his palm as he stared at Shampoo<br/>calmly.<p>"What? Who are you? What are you doing here?" said the elf girl in<br/>shock.<p>"You must be the princess Shampoo, my, but you'll fetch a fine<br/>price," said Herb as he leaned forward and stared her dead in the<br/>eyes.<p>"What have you done with the elves?" she snarled angrily.<p>"Captured, dead, or run away. It doesn't really matter does it?"<br/>said Herb with a small chuckle. "Come now. You've been beaten. Give<br/>the Kajakan to the Ghost, and have him bring it to me."<p>"The Ghost?" said Ryoga as he turned to look back at the doors.<p>"Yes, I am the Spirit of the Dragon. I will take the sacred staff<br/>from the Ghost, and destroy the Emperor," said Herb with a mad looking<br/>grin forming on his face. "I will have my revenge at last, and the<br/>evil child will be destroyed at last. I will become emperor, and we'll<br/>all live better lives. Isn't that nice?"<p>"Humph, traitor," Akane stepped forward with a dark look in her<br/>eyes. "I'll have your head for this."<p>"You won't be leaving here alive I'm afraid. Take them," Herb<br/>waved his hand and several armor-clad figures walked out from behind<br/>the great wooden pillars that lined the room on both sides. The heavy<br/>wooden doors closed them into the room. "Thus the trap is shut. Now,<br/>lady Akane, you and your friends will die." Herb turned towards the<br/>black knights and smirked. "Kill them, but leave the human male. I<br/>need him alive." Herb paused, none of the men were moving. He turned<br/>slowly and saw a strange white glow surrounding the elf girl.<p>"Shampoo, now," whispered Ukyo from behind the elf.<p>The purple haired elf stepped aside, and Herb's eyes went wide as<br/>he found himself staring down the knight's spear, and the ball of<br/>white energy that was collecting on its tip.<p>"You talk too much," said Ukyo as she finally released the power<br/>on him.<p>"No!" whispered the man as he stepped back. The energy slammed<br/>into him, creating a blinding flash of light. The throne was vaporized<br/>in an instant, along with any portion of the wall and floor that the<br/>blast had touched. A huge pile of ash was all that remained when the<br/>light faded away.<p>Akane was in motion before the blast struck home. She rushed<br/>towards the nearest knight, slamming into him with a side kick that<br/>dented his armor inward as she grabbed at the sword that hung from his<br/>side. In an instant she was standing at the ready with her blade.<br/>"Now, which among you wishes to challenge my authority as Lady of the<br/>Black Knights?"<p>The men stepped back away from her, giving her a wide area of<br/>clearance. She slowly turned and smiled grimly at the small party.<br/>"Well? We'd best leave before he wakes up."<p>"What?" said Ryoga in surprise.<p>"These cowards are not my knights," said Akane as she looked at<br/>the armor clad men, who were still standing around in shock. "They<br/>would turn on me in an instant. I'm smart enough to realize my<br/>position is still unfavorable at the moment."<p>"What do you mean wakes up? I vaporized that bastard!" snarled<br/>Ukyo.<p>At that moment, the smoking pile of ash began to rise from the<br/>floor slowly as something began to grow from within it. Two glowing<br/>red eyes appeared as a head became clearly visible, rows of small<br/>horns began to push out from around the face, as the ash began to pour<br/>away from the thing. It was clearly inhuman and very pissed off. It<br/>grew larger and larger with each passing moment, until it was easily<br/>thirty meter's long.<p>"No way!" said Ukyo as she stepped back.<p>"Shit," muttered Ryu.<p>"He was a beast-man," said Ryoga as he began to back away as well.<p>"No..." said Shampoo in horror.<p>The dragon roared, rearing its head back to reveal the golden<br/>scales under its belly. It's roar was cut short as a figure appeared<br/>out of nowhere and slammed into the thing's head, sending it crashing<br/>into the floor.<p>"Took you long enough damn it!" snapped Ryu as he started running<br/>towards the doors after Ranma. The elf girl had landed in a sprint,<br/>and was already charging towards the dumbstruck knights who were in<br/>front of them.<p>"You looked like you were handling it!" snapped the redhead in<br/>retort as she took out the two men who were directly in their path.<p>Ryu simply charged forward, slamming the doors open easily despite<br/>their size and weight.<p>"Now what?" cried Ukyo as she stopped just behind them as they<br/>paused for a moment in the hall.<p>"We run," said Ranma as she looked back and saw the dragon was<br/>slowly regaining its senses.<p>Shampoo rushed up to them, dragging Ryoga at her side. "Follow<br/>me!" she said as she turned down the hall.<p>"That's not the way out!" snarled Akane as she backed out of the<br/>throne room. Herb was looking directly at her now, and she had her<br/>sword held at the ready.<p>"We can't go the way we came. He'd have hidden guards in every<br/>elven home, just in case we escaped," said Ranma as she started after<br/>Shampoo.<p>The entire group moved after Shampoo as she led them up the<br/>stairs.<p>"Where are we going?" snapped Akane as an angry roar sounded a<br/>short distance behind them.<p>"Secret passage," said Shampoo as she tugged Ryoga's arm<br/>violently. The dwarf was running too hard too speak at the moment, in<br/>order to prevent Shampoo from lifting him off the ground and pulling<br/>him through the air.<p>"Great," muttered Ryu as he followed. "What if they found it all<br/>ready?"<p>"We're screwed," said the elf calmly as she turned up a stairwell.<p>"Where is this passage?" said Ranma with a strange calmness on her<br/>face.<p>"At the top of the palace," said Shampoo.<p>"Um, guys?" cried Ukyo as she ran.<p>"That's about fifteen floors from here," said Ranma with a small<br/>nod.<p>"Faster guys," said Ukyo as she pushed herself a little harder.<p>"Right," agreed Shampoo.<p>"Move it!" screamed Ukyo.<p>The wall below them seemed to explode as the dragon rushed up the<br/>stairs at an insane rate of speed. It roared angrily as it charged,<br/>carving up sections of wall as its bulky form scraped against the<br/>narrow passageway. Tables and tapestries that dotted the stairway on<br/>each floor were shattered as it barreled after them, slowing it<br/>slightly.<p>"Shit!" snorted Ranma as she rushed forward, leading the group at<br/>a much faster pace.<p>Herb snarled angrily as it slammed into another table behind them,<br/>he stumbled for a moment and shook his head before charging forward<br/>again. Ash still dirtied his sliver and gold skin, and his eyes seemed<br/>to burn brighter with his anger as he slithered down the passageway<br/>after them. His huge wings tore through the wall as if it was paper as<br/>he flexed them angrily.<p>"He's slowing down!" said Shampoo.<p>"Then run faster!" cried Ukyo as she shoved at the girl's back,<br/>forcing her to move a little more.<p>"What?" said Shampoo. Her protest were quickly silenced as a<br/>golden light tore through the stairwell and through it, blasting a<br/>hole through the building and into the air outside.<p>Herb closed his mouth and glared up at the still retreating party.<br/>He snorted in disgust and continued to move up the stairs after them.<p>"There's the top floor!" cried Ranma as he pushed himself through<br/>the last door at the top of the stairs. "Get your ass up here<br/>Shampoo!"<p>"Coming!" snapped the elf as she rushed by, followed by the rest<br/>of the group.<p>Herb's head appeared behind them, snapping angrily and barely<br/>missing them. The beast's head pulled back out of the room for a<br/>moment as Ranma ducked into the next room with the others.<p>"Here!" said Shampoo as she opened the floor in the middle of the<br/>room.<p>"This isn't a passage! It's a hole!" snapped Ukyo as she peered<br/>into the endless void that stared back at her.<p>"Jump or die! It's your choice!" snapped the elf as she vanished<br/>into the darkness below.<p>"Go!" snapped Ranma as she appeared in the room.<p>Akane was the next to jump, she scowled at them for a moment<br/>before Ryu shoved her in all the way, and followed after her.<p>"I'm gettin to old for this," muttered Ryoga as he looked at the<br/>pair for a moment. He then vanished as well.<p>"Go!" snapped Ranma.<p>"But..." said Ukyo with terror in her eyes.<p>"Do it!" snapped Ranma.<p>"Oh shit!" gasped Ukyo as she glanced behind the redhead.<p>Walking up to them with a slowly quickening pace, was the ugliest<br/>creature she had ever seen. It was a scaled man, with the head of a<br/>dragon. A small crown of horns lined his face and he glared at them,<br/>drool dripped from his chin as he worked his jaws open and closed. His<br/>claws worked as he stared at them angrily, and his body began to glow.<br/>"Die!" it cried as it stopped in the doorway and raised its claws into<br/>the sky.<p>"No!" screamed Ukyo as she found herself shoved into the hole.<br/>Then, there was a flash of light. She screamed as the golden energy<br/>threatened to overtake her, even as she fell. Finally, there was only<br/>blackness.<p>+++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo frowned as she looked into the mirror. "What is he<br/>doing?" she muttered.<p>The image shifted, and the top of the largest tree in the forest<br/>suddenly became nothing more than a golden flash of light. It vanished<br/>slowly, revealing nothing but a single figure floating in the air<br/>where the center of the blast had originated.<p>"That idiot killed them," snorted the girl irritably. She waved<br/>her hand for a moment over the surface of the mirror and seemed to<br/>relax slightly. "No, he failed. At least a few of them are still<br/>alive."<p>She watched the beast-man change back into the dragon once again as it<br/>began to circle the area in frustration. "Well, it seems you've lost<br/>them again darling." She smirked and watched him search for a moment.<br/>"Too bad, I never expected that...heh."<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Where am I?"<p>Ukyo Kuonji slowly opened her eyes and sat up. There was a thin<br/>sheet covering her body and every part of her seemed to ache. She was<br/>lying on some kind of wooden bed, and was alone in the darkness.<br/>"Ouch. What happened to us? Ranchan?" She glanced around, searching<br/>for her beloved for a moment.<p>"You're awake," said a voice to her gently.<p>Ukyo turned and saw the most shriveled looking creature she had<br/>ever seen staring back at her.<p>"Gah! A troll!" she cried as she pulled the sheet up to cover<br/>herself. Somewhere along the line, her armor had been removed, along<br/>with her clothes. Cologne, the elder of the elves, promptly hit her<br/>over the head with her staff.<p>"I told you you'd scare her," said a familiar voice in the<br/>darkness. Shampoo walked up and sat down next to the table. "Relax<br/>Kuonji, we're all ladies here."<p>"Huh? Wha? Where am I? What's going on?" said the knight in<br/>confusion.<p>"This is the secret escape route of our tribe," said Shampoo with<br/>a small shrug. "It was an old dwarven mine, but we drove the creatures<br/>off many centuries ago, and saved our forest from them. We now use the<br/>caverns as a shelter in time of need."<p>Ukyo nodded and hung her head. "Ranchan? Where is he?"<p>"You mean that Kumon boy?" said Cologne with a small chuckle.<p>"Ryu?" said Ukyo with a look of disgust on her face.<p>"Surely you don't mean that disgusting little dwarf?" said Cologne<br/>in shock.<p>Ukyo went completely pale. "No!"<p>Shampoo shook her head and put her finger to her lips with a scowl<br/>on her face for a moment from behind the old woman's back.<p>"Never mind," muttered Ukyo as she gave Shampoo a distrusting<br/>frown.<p>"Very well, I shall leave you to rest now," said Cologne as she<br/>noticed the silent battle of wills between the two girls. She hopped<br/>away, leaving the pair in silence.<p>"Where is Ranma?"<p>"Right over there," said Shampoo as she raised her hand. A ball of<br/>light formed and rose into the air, giving the room a soft glow. The<br/>red-haired elf was lying on a table a few yards away, still sleeping.<p>Ukyo stood up to go to her, throwing the sheet aside despite her<br/>nudity. She paused as a hand fell on her shoulder.<p>"There is time for that later, he needs rest first," Shampoo<br/>smiled at her and nodded gently.<p>Both girls froze as a new figure entered the room, taking Shampoo<br/>into his arms. "Shampoo! You have returned to me at last!"<p>Ukyo froze, staring at the newcomer in shocked horror.<p>"Oh my darling Shampoo! I heard about your return, and had to come<br/>see you at once! At last we can be together!"<p>"Mousse, what the hell are you doing here?" said Shampoo in shock.<p>"Visiting you, of course!" replied the boy cheerfully. He turned<br/>and adjusted his glasses as he noticed Ukyo standing there beside him.<br/>"Oh, hello. Who are you?"<p>Ukyo screamed, punching him dead in the face and grabbing the<br/>sheet to cover herself at the same time.<p>Mousse sailed through the air, coming down hard just outside the<br/>doorway.<p>Shampoo smirked and looked at Ukyo for a moment. "Nice distance."<p>"Pervert!" screeched Ukyo as she continued to glare at the<br/>confused looking boy who was lying on his back just outside the room.<p>Shampoo walked over to the door and frowned at him. "Stay out you<br/>idiot. This room is girls only, you pervert."<p>Mousse blinked as she slammed the door in his face. He glanced<br/>around, and found himself alone in the hallway again. He stood up and<br/>dusted himself off. He removed his glasses and tucked them inside his<br/>sleeve, as he calmly walked away with a strange smirk on his face.<p>++++++++++++<p>"So, now what?" said Ryu as he sat across from Ryoga calmly. The<br/>pair was waiting in a small room with a fireplace. The room itself was<br/>rather well furnished, books lined the walls, and there was a small<br/>table in the corner. The both of them were sitting in the lounge<br/>chairs, with drinks in their hands just in front of the fireplace.<p>"We still haven't been paid," snorted the dwarf impatiently.<p>"That will come in time," said an unfamiliar voice. The pair<br/>turned and found an old woman balancing precariously on the end of her<br/>staff. "Once your partner wakes up, we have business to discuss."<p>"Right," agreed Ryu with a small frown.<p>"Well, here's to a job well done," said Ryoga with a chuckle.<p>"Indeed," said Cologne with a small frown.<p>"Not as well as I would have liked, but we've completed the terms<br/>of the contract," said Ryu with a small frown. "We'll take the money<br/>and leave, the Kajakan, and all it's problems are yours now old<br/>woman."<p>"Indeed," agreed Cologne as she watched him for a moment<br/>cautiously. "It makes one wonder how they found out though?"<p>"Shampoo, Ranma, and myself were the only ones who knew our final<br/>destination," said Ryu calmly. "Not even the knights knew."<p>"Interesting, how did they find out?" said Cologne as she hopped<br/>up and poked at the fire for a moment.<p>"A witch most likely," said Ryu with a shrug of his shoulders.<p>"I had heard you were immune to such power," said the old woman as<br/>she glanced over at him.<p>"We are, but you're not," said Ryu with a small chuckle. "In any<br/>case, it's no longer our problem." He sipped at his drink lazily and<br/>smirked at her.<p>"Indeed," said Cologne with a small frown as she hopped away.<br/>"I'll leave you for now. Have Shampoo summon me once your partner<br/>wakes up."<p>+++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo sat quietly, staring at the bars in front of her<br/>coldly. Two guards stood on either side of her cell, watching her<br/>silently. She eyed them for a moment, causing them to shift<br/>uncomfortably as they watched her. She chuckled and shook her head for<br/>a moment, turning towards the wall again.<p>+++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: The Wrath of Herb!<p>
