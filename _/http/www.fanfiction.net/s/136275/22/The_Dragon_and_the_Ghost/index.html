</div>Just to prove I'm still writing-<br/>Hi. Been a while since I put anything out. My old PC kinda died. I spent the last few years sitting in my cave in front of the fire grunting. I haven't written in a while, and anything I had was consumed by my old PC's aging HD. All of my ways to get stuff out died before it did.<p>Don't worry, Insertion's big ending is beginning to stir in the back of my mind, but I need to sharpen my claws a bit.<p>The Dragon and the Ghost<p>Part 22<p>Pirates of the Southern Seas.<p>Ranma Saotome stormed out of a small hovel grumbling to herself in anger as she dusted soot off her arms. "Stupid wizard, tryin to ruin a good shirt." She noted her surroundings and paused for a moment in surprise. She looked at the dirt and frowned as she pressed a rather mundane looking gold ring against her forehead. "Let darkness be my light." She moved forward a bit slower and glanced around the neighborhood in front of the home.<p>"Hail. Young one, a dark light shines within you." An old voice rang up from beside her and the redhead stopped cold in her tracks.<p>"One that shines in the deepest darkness," she replied as she turned to look back a smile on her face. Her eyes had a soft golden glow from her irises.<p>Another pair just like hers peered back from the shadowy corner of the doorway. She could see the old drow man sitting against the wall with an unlit pipe in his hand. He struck a match and puffed on it for a moment as he leaned forward and put his wrist against his back. "I've heard a human came through one of our gates on light pass. I assume that's what the hurry is about. Had a few others with him as well. Ain't seen much of em. My guess, Ilpalazzo."<p>The redhead rolled her eyes. "Uhg. Great." She flipped him a coin from the small purse at her side as she started walking away muttering in irritation. "That dope. I'll kill him."<p>"Hail Ilpalazzo!" was the sort of stereo response. Excel raised her arm and puffed out her chest in the presence of her lord and master. Beside her, a blood soaked arm raised in salute from the ground.<p>A rather bored looking drow sat looking down at her without much emotion. "Report?" He was sitting on a throne what appeared to be a cavern converted into a throne room.<p>"Excel endured many hardships on this mission! She bravely ventured forth into danger and horrible torture to carry out her beloved Lord Ilpalazzo's every command! She attempted to complete her goal, but was captured! Her captors beat upon Excel while Ha-chan evaded detection by being dead."<p>"A most excellent ploy." Ilpalazzo eyed the body lying on the ground next to his henchman with his eyes softening a little.<p>Excel noticed this and twitched for a moment before she continued her story. "After her capture, Excel was thrown into a pit with no food or water. The emergency food supply seemed to be fortuitous thinking, when Excel was suddenly saved, and nearly drowned in a flash flood. Thoughts of failure, and a displeased frown on Lord Ilpalazzo's incredibly handsome features drove Excel onward, and she attacked her captors and was promptly thrown back into the pit. This time with a ball and chain on her leg to keep her from swimming out again. Fortunately, Excel was ravenous with hunger and ate her way through her bonds!" She seemed quite pleased with her self and bounced in place for a moment as she spoke. "After her second miraculous escape, the enemy stopped trying to capture her, and simply tried to kill her. She fought onward for the honor and glory of ACROSS and Lord Ilpalazzo!"<p>The drow frowned at her again and shifted in his seat for a moment. The time for her to stop talking had long since passed, and she'd yet to realize it. He reached up to grab the rope that hung just beside his throne.<p>"Hello Ilpalazzo."<p>Excel had noticed her masters pose and was frozen in place. Her head jerked back at the new group of people in the hallway just outside the room. Her master had yet to react or move and looked a little slack jawed at the man who strolled in with his arms spread in a rather open gesture. She breathed a small sigh of relief and relaxed her arms. Her master seemed to have forgotten about her punishment. "Whew. That was a close one..."<p>"Been a long time. How've you been?" The human seemed cheerful a little too cheerful.<p>"Ryuu? What brings you?" The drow male pulled himself from his seat with the rope and Excel dropped into a trap door under her feet.<p>He strolled down to meet the man and frowned at him as he drew near. The drow simply waited at the bottom of the stairs to his throne with his robes hiding his posture from view. "What brings you? The rest of you can stop hiding in that hallway now. I am drow and I can see you quite well." He reached down and took a few crumpled pages from the blood soaked hand that reached up beside him.<p>"Trouble with your servants?" Ryuu didn't look very interested in discussing it at length.<p>"She's allergic to air." He pulled the pages inside his large cape and frowned at the man who dared come so close to him.<p>The young drow girl seemed to be recovering and the pair turned towards the approaching party.<p>"My, an elven princess in F. Imagine that? Tell me what you've been up..." Ilpalazzo's face fell as he stared at Mousse and stopped speaking. "Ryuu, tell me. What are you doing here?"<p>"You know this guy?" Ukyo didn't seem pleased with the situation. She wasn't sure how much she trusted the drow boy beside her. The Dwarf she could count on, but he only seemed interested in keeping the elf girl happy and safe. A little too much for her liking actually. Ryuu was much more dangerous than she had anticipated as well. She found that fact comforting in a strange way.<p>"We've met." Ryuu was eying the man while his head was turned away with a strange grin. "See something that interests you?"<p>Mousse didn't look very comfortable with the stare he was getting. Shampoo was silent and almost dead to the world around her. She wasn't showing any emotion and appeared to be taking in everything around her as best she could. It was obvious she was terrified and trying her best not to show it. "What are you staring at?"<p>"Can you answer me that yourself boy?" The drow man's lip turned up for the briefest of moments as he turned back towards Ryuu. "Introductions can wait. What do you want Ryuu? I'm growing tired of asking."<p>"Safe passage to the north gates. Ranma isn't around, and I'm stuck with the mob."<p>"Stop calling us that!" snapped Ukyo. She was holding her spear rather tight and it didn't seem wise to bother her. She was feeling pretty upset with someone at the moment. "Ranma! What kind of man have you become! The Black Swordsman?"<p>"A pity." Ilpalazzo seemed a little disappointed to hear that.<p>"Make that the Southern Gates, actually." A familiar female voice echoed through the cavern as a pair of glowing eyes appeared behind Ryuu's head, floating in the air and bloodshot with anger.<p>Everyone in the room froze as Ryuu fell to the ground quite suddenly. Ranma was glaring at him as she appeared standing over him with her sheathed sword still held in the swing that had knocked the boy over. She kicked him in the ribs and frowned as she glared at the drown in front of her with her sword resting on her shoulder in it's sheath. She glanced up at the drow and sighed. "Don't say a word. I can take care of this without you. Sorry for the inconvenience. That idiot."<p>"You have something I want." Ilpalazzo frowned at her and stared her down.<p>"I told you what would happen if you bothered me about with that again. Don't take my warning lightly." she snorted and cracked her knuckles for a moment.<p>Shampoo was watching the redhead with even wider eyes. "It's not possible..." Her eyes were glowing as Mousse's were, and every other drown in the room. It had been like a trip through a nightmare just to reach where she was with all those glowing eyes all around her.<p>"Not so attractive now?" Mousse seemed pleased and irritated at the same time.<p>"No. She is not drow. I can feel her connection to nature."<p>"You cannot feel it with me?" His voice tensed as he asked her.<p>"No. I always assumed you were...removed from it. It does happen to elves on occasion."<p>Mousse didn't move or respond. He glanced over to see Ranma speaking with the drow they had met with Ryuu. The servant still in the room seemed to be recovering and was on her knees and looking about. They seemed to be wrapping things up and he cursed himself for getting distracted and missing it.<p>"That's not what I mean." Ranma noticed that Ilpalazzo had moved so that his back was to Shampoo and Mousse.<p>She narrowed her eyes at him. "So long as it doesn't interfere with the job. What do you want?"<p>"The Prince, he remembered how to find this place."<p>"You sure?" The redhead glanced over the man's shoulder and smirked. He was busy talking to the elf girl. Ryuu was starting to stir on the ground between them and she kicked him again to put a stop to it.<p>"Ryuu cannot open one of our doors. I was wondering how he got here in the first place, until I noticed him."<p>"He remembers then." Ranma took a small glance over her shoulder with a smirk at the drow boy in her group.<p>"Yes. I am very curious to know what has kept him away so long."<p>"Good to know, I had him figured for lost. I suppose it makes us all do strange things." Shampoo should be dead if what she knew of Mousse's duties to be true.<p>"What's that?" Ilpalazzo seemed confused and annoyed.<p>"Nothing." Her face fell as she seemed to remember who she was talking to. Her voice dropped as she gave the man a small grin. "I'm leaving now. I've got a job to do, and I don't mind losing a useless tag along if you catch my drift. I'll be needing to do something about it sooner or later anyway."<p>"I see." He nodded and turned back towards the throne.<p>Ranma turned to face the rather surprised and irate looking group behind her. She hung her shoulders a little and sighed for a moment. As she drew closer to them, her smile grew stranger and more confident with each step. Her eyes appeared wild as she gazed at them with a glassy eyed stare. "Ha...hehheh."<p>"Why are you looking at us like that?" Ukyo didn't look pleased or fearful.<p>"Heh. You'll see, soon enough. We're leaving now, come on Ryuu."<p>The man in question was just pushing himself off his rear. He glanced at the sick looking drow and sighed as he shook his head. "Asshole."<p>She gave him a small grin and raised her hand in a grim and cheerful gesture.<p>"What am I doing here?" Akane Tendo glared at herself in the mirror in her tent. The battle was long since over and her troops were returning home with those of her father. Both of their campaigns had been successful, and Akane had a large bag of polished skulls as a gift for her master. Saffron would ascend into godhood soon, and she would be...what? There was unfinished business at hand, and she had no idea where to start looking. It was frustrating her to no end and she stared daggers into her own reflection. "I must find him." Her gaze changed as she seemed to look at herself a little closer. Nabiki was scheming against her now as well. She had no doubt that her sister wanted to be rid of her.<p>"What do I do?" Saffron's High Priestess was a dangerous enemy, and she could become more dangerous after his accent. She felt trapped, cornered, just as much as in that cave. "There's no where to run. I want to finish it before I die."<p>She turned away and paused as she noticed her father in the doorway to her tent. "Are you feeling well daughter? You seem to be acting odd lately."<p>"I'm leaving. Where is the nearest town?"<p>"Is something wrong?" The man seemed alarmed and grabbed her by her shoulders and forced her in front of him.<p>She looked away from him and at the ground in frustration. "I'm fine. I have something I need to finish. It's going to bother me until I do."<p>The man stepped back and nodded. "I see."<p>She walked by and grabbed her sword by the tent flap before pausing halfway out. "Father?"<p>"Yes?"<p>She glanced back at him for a moment. "Who is Ranma Saotome?"<p>She had all of his attention and he pulled himself up to his full height with a strange angry glare in his eyes. "Where did you hear that name?"<p>She looked away and walked off without another word. "So. It's true then." As she exited her tent she turned and glared at the two sullen beast men standing guard just outside her tent. "Lime, Mint, we are leaving."<p>The two sullen beast-men lurched after her at a somewhat lazy pace. It was obvious both of them were unhappy. Akane would be a decent master, but she wasn't one of them either. They had expected to spend their lives with their master, as their parents before them did. They had failed in their duty to Herb and his line, and shamed their ancestors.<p>Mint clapped his companion on the back as he noticed Akane moving ahead of them a little to much. "Come on. I've a feeling we're gonna be gone for a while this time. Might be nice."<p>"Heh. Yeah." Lime straightened up a bit and picked up his pace to catch up to them.<p>A short time later...<p>"F! Are you dense?" Ranma was walking down a long empty tunnel and chewing Ryuu out as the group trailed just behind them. "I give you an elven princess, tell you to take her someplace safe, and you take her to F! What the hell is wrong with you!"<p>Ryuu didn't look happy, but the pair hadn't resorted to blows just yet either. "She's fine isn't she? Look, your girlfriend is safe and everything! You know she can't get hurt with me around! I know the mission okay!"<p>"What's this? A lover's spat?" Mousse seemed more annoyed than anything else.<p>"Better not let them hear you say that." Shampoo glanced back at him with a little annoyance in her voice.<p>"They don't scare me." He puffed himself up a bit and looked a little annoyed with the idea.<p>"They should. Not even I would try and stand against the Black Swordsman." Ukyo didn't look at either of them as she said it and continued on as they froze in confusion.<p>Mousse shrugged at the elven girl's confused frown.<p>Their guides were still arguing as they walked just ahead of them. "Wait!" She rushed up to the knight's side and walked beside her. Mousse kept up just behind them and watched their backs.<p>"What do you mean? What's the big deal about..."<p>"Five thousand men fell at Ahlen's Keep. The siege lasted only four hours."<p>"So?" Mousse didn't seem impressed.<p>"Those soldiers faced only one boy."<p>The pair of elves both glanced at the man in question's back and the two swords that hung there.<p>"There are other stories, a child warrior and mercenary who slaughtered uncountable numbers of men at battles all across this land. About three years ago, the stories stopped, or so I thought." She found herself gripping the plates of armor on her shoulders and forced herself to let go.<p>"What do you mean thought?" asked Shampoo in confusion.<p>"They simply changed into stories of the Dragon Ghost. I'm not a fool, but I have been blinded by the feelings from my youth far to long." The stare she was giving the redhead was not a loving gaze by any stretch.<p>"Giving up?" asked the elven girl with a strange smirk on her face.<p>"I'll decide that when I find out who he really is." She made it clear that she was finished talking as she sped up her pace a little to put some distance between them.<p>"Great." She glanced back at Mousse for a moment and he started to pick up his pace towards her. "Stay back. I'm afraid I don't trust you alone down here. I'll kill you if you get to close." Her stare was hard and firm when she finished speaking and turned away.<p>He clenched his fist and growled as he stared at the ground in frustration. He had spent his life protecting her, he'd do anything to keep her happy. She couldn't trust him? Why not?<p>Ranma narrowed her eyes as she stopped walking and turned to face them with her finger up to her lip. "Company ahead."<p>Ryuu didn't seem worried and snorted. "So what?"<p>"We are in what could be considered 'hostile territory'. I'd rather not piss of the locals and have to hack my way out of here."<p>"I agree." Ukyo stepped forward and gave them both a serious looking frown. "You made some sort of deal didn't you?"<p>"Huh?" The redhead turned to face her with a nervous looking grin. "What makes you say that?"<p>She grabbed him by his collar and pulled him close to her. "What did you do?"<p>"Nothing. They're just going to try and kidnap Mousse here later. No big deal."<p>"What?" The knight was furious and slugged her across her jaw. "You...you..."<p>"What!" Ranma sat up with wide eyes. "Look, it's not that big a deal. He's just a tag along and he's on his own. I don't need him and he's gonna get in the way sooner or later. My job is her and that staff."<p>"What does that make me then?" She was staring down at him with her fist clenched down. Everyone else was standing around them watching.<p>"I also agreed to help your queen if I could. Like I said, after this mess is over, you can have the stupid staff if you need it. Once I deliver, you do as you please." Ranma was returning her stare and seemed much more cautious as she put a short distance between them. "I don't like having him along much, and he can stay as long as he's useful. I wouldn't worry about him, I know what's coming and, unfortunately, he can handle it no problem."<p>"What would you know of what I can handle?" Mousse stepped forward and with his chest puffed out. "I should kill you for what you've done!"<p>Ranma put her arm across his shoulders and shook him a bit. It threw him off for a moment and she poked him in the chest. "Trust me, you've got nothing to worry about."<p>"You've put Shampoo in danger!"<p>"Nah." She strolled forward with a different swagger about her and chuckled to herself in an odd way. Ryuu jumped off the wall he was leaning against. He looked like he just remembered something that made him really nervous. Ukyo and Shampoo stepped back a little. She didn't sound normal.<p>"Is Ranma all right?" Ukyo turned towards Ryuu and he rushed up to the redhead's side.<p>"Maybe this isn't such a good idea..." The swordsman put his arm across her shoulders and walked with her. "I mean, I don't think the knight can take it. We should find..."<p>"Another way to Jusendo?" Ranma seemed to be enjoying annoying him.<p>"What? Jusendo? That would take weeks!"<p>"Aye, it would." She nodded with a menacing smirk.<p>"Why?" He gripped her a little tighter in an implied threat.<p>"There's something there we'll need."<p>"What's that?" he asked her with his voice tensing a little more.<p>"Don't know, all I have is a map."<p>"Can I see it?"<p>"No, I've got it up here." She poked her finger on her temple and chuckled again. "We have to go. That's about all I can tell you." She strolled forward and chuckled to herself.<p>"Something has put her in a good mood." Ukyo frowned at her two companions, Ryuu and Ranma tended to stay a few paces ahead of them when they were together. Ranma was taking the lead and Ryuu didn't look happy. In fact, he looked mortified with terror.<p>"Um, I'm not about to ask. Ranma is acting very strange." Shampoo looked to be feeling a bit better since the redhead showed up.<p>A short distance ahead...<p>"Heh. Excel lies in silent wait of her prey!" The girl was leaning against a rock and drooling as she waved a sword about over her head. She had a small dog tied to her head that seemed to be holding on in silent suffering.<p>Beside her, a young drow girl with a pale complexion and a soft raspy voice glanced up at her. She looked more like she was using the rock to hold herself up. "Senior Excel, what is it we are doing again?" A light trickle of blood was running out of the corner of her mouth.<p>"Ha-chan! It is very important to remember our duty to ACROSS and Lord Ilpalazzo! We must wait here, and capture the lost prince at any cost! We must not fail in our sacred duty! My beloved Lord Ilpalazzo! Excel may be forced to accidentally on purpose kill the object of your affection! She will gladly open her arms to comfort you in your time of need! For in order to fulfill her mission, she will no doubt be forced to cut down, and maim, and crush the evil harlot, Lord Ilpalazzo loves so much! Though Lord Ilpalazzo may never forgive her for such actions, she lives with the hope he shall be merciful with his faithful Excel, and see fit to grant her..."<p>"Hi Excel."<p>"What the hell is this?" The drow prince walked up to the redhead who was watching the drow girl's speech with a wide grin on her face.<p>"It is Excel's prey!" She pointed at Mousse and laughed out loud as the rest of the group walked up. Ryuu had passed by already and ignored the scene. He stopped when he realized everyone else had and was leaning against the wall again.<p>Ukyo noticed the other drow was lying on top of the rock with blood seeping down to the cave floor from her face. She walked closer and poked the back of her head. "Are you all right?"<p>The head sat up and coughed, spraying the unfortunate knight's face with blood and spit. "I'm...fin..." Her head hit the rock again with a dull thud.<p>The knight shrieked in shock and revulsion as she jumped back away from the pair.<p>"Come on Ha-chan! We must complete our mission for Lord Ilpalazzo and ACROSS!" Excel gave her friend's body a hearty slap on the back before grabbing her limp hand and pulling her off the rock and onto her face. "Ha-chan! This is no time to be dead! Cruel fate! Excel must now complete this most dangerous assignment all alone!" She walked up to Mousse and grabbed him by the arm meaning to pull him back to her master.<p>"What the hell are you doing?" he frowned at her as she simply kicked up dust in her efforts. He wasn't moving.<p>"Hmm, it seems the task is more difficult than Excel anticipated!"<p>"Why are you wearing a dog?" Shampoo couldn't contain herself and walked up closer to them.<p>"You won't stop Excel from completing her mission!" The drow girl held her sword up with her free hand.<p>Mousse was about to clock her when the elf girl spoke up.<p>"You can have him if you want. That's just really weird."<p>"This is Menchi! Excel's emergency food supply! You'll have to excuse us, we have a mission to complete here."<p>"We? She's dead!" Ukyo was still trying to wipe her face off enough to satisfy herself she was clean. She pointed at the other drow's body.<p>"I told you we didn't have anything to worry about." Ranma started walking down the tunnel with her hands in her pockets. She seemed satisfied with the events.<p>Excel was about to turn the sword on Mousse when he belted her across her skull one good time and sent her down. "I suppose I shouldn't be to angry with him then. Still, the principal..."<p>"I don't care if you like him." Shampoo shrugged and started after the others.<p>"Gross!" Ukyo was still wiping off her face. "When is this stupid tunnel gonna end anyway."<p>"Just ahead!" called back Ranma. She turned forward again and chuckled to herself. "I can smell it, we're drawing near..."<p>"Please reconsider. She'll try and kill you if you do this."<p>Ranma was ignoring Ryuu's pleas. "The sea." She was almost stumbling at this point and rather looked like a sailor fresh off the boat from a long voyage.<p>"What's wrong with him?" Ukyo was eying Ranma as she walked up to Ryuu. She didn't look like she wanted to speak with her.<p>"You'll find out. We're going to Jusendo."<p>"That's across the sea! Are we going to charter a ship?" She didn't look pleased. "Why are we going into the lions den? Jusendo belongs to the Emperor, more so than the rest of his empire, it's his home."<p>"Don't know. This is her show, and I'm smart enough to believe her when she says we're going." He looked like he just broke down for a moment and shook his head. "Damn. Look, maybe you shouldn't do this. We'll be back, our business is still here."<p>"What?" She frowned at him and furrowed her brow.<p>Ranma was having trouble standing up strait and was muttering to herself as she continued to stumble forward. It was almost like she was drunk, or fresh off a long sea voyage. "I can smell it. The sea..." Her eyes were glassy and she leaned against the wall for a moment peering out the exit to the cavern as it slid aside in front of her. "Heh." A flash of lightning lit the doorway as the sound of water pouring onto the ground filled the narrow passage.<p>"Go back, or you may not be able to stay a knight. If you continue now, don't say I didn't warn you." He turned away and rushed after Ranma. She was stumbling out the entrance to the cave into a torrential downpour.<p>Ukyo glanced back at Mousse and Shampoo as they passed by. She clenched her fist and strolled after them. "You're not leaving me behind." She had a night to think it over anyway. There was no way they were sailing in this weather.<p>The Port City of Furinkan...<p>It was a wet miserable evening. The rain had stopped, but it was not to last. Black ominous clouds filled the sky in the distance, blocking out the sunset completely. Angry lightning flashed in the distance, weather no sailor would be caught dead in if a port could save him the risk.<p>The taverns were busy, and bustling with nervous chatter as the men drinking inside spoke of storms of the past. It was a night for drinking and remembering friends lost, and daring escapes from the jaws of such weather. Most of it touted as a 'hunred tines worse'!<p>The bartender was in a more cheerful mood than usual. His business was booming, and it would be dishonest to say he didn't look forward to such weather. He still towered over his bar with a sour frown gazing into the establishment with one glass eye staring off towards the doorway. A piano played a merry tune just under the loud chattering and laughter of drunken sailors. His brow furrowed as he turned towards the swinging doorway and the storm outside.<p>The doors swung open and a figure strolled in with a black hood pulled down over her features. She was wearing a sword and stood there for a moment as the lightning flashed angrily behind her. She strolled inside and moved up to the counter placing a single gold coin on the counter. "Rum. The whole bottle."<p>A group walked in behind her, most of them looked nervous. The swordsman walked forward and took the bottle after the hooded figure poured herself a glass and knocked it back. He pulled a swig from the bottle itself and tossed it to Ukyo. "You'll be needing that I think."<p>She frowned at him and stayed near the door leaning against the wall as she took a drink.<p>"What be yer business here?"<p>"Sailing for Jusendo." She smiled at him as he filled her glass again. The coin more than paid for the bottle. She could have gotten a case for as much.<p>There was a roar of laughter from the sailors and she glanced back at them all.<p>There was a collective gasp from the men and they all went dead white and silent.<p>Ukyo stood up in alarm halfway through another gulp from the bottle. Shampoo and Mousse were standing next to her now and watching the events unfold. "What's going on here?"<p>"Blue eyes! Did ya see that?" muttered one of the men in earshot.<p>The bartender seemed to grow more cautious as he poured her next drink. "There be no sailing from this port tonight. In the morning..."<p>"I don't need a charter, and I sail tonight. See to it that you inform the magistrate of it."<p>"Damn it Ranma..." Ryuu looked annoyed.<p>"Of what?" The bartender snorted and continued to clean his glass until she looked up at him. The man jumped back in terror and knocked a few bottles out of the rack behind him.. She pulled back her hood and every man in the bar was on his feet.<p>"It's her!" gasped on near to the party in horror. "Captain Scarlet!"<p>Shampoo's eyebrow arched a little in surprise. "Never a dull moment."<p>"I'll say," agreed Mousse. "Too much if you ask me."<p>"I didn't."<p>"Captain Scarlet?" Ukyo was shaking and pale as a ghost. "Ranma! How could you?"<p>The redhead seemed to be enjoying herself quite a bit as she knocked back another. The bartender dropped the bottle as her glass clicked on the counter top. "Come on. We sail for Jusendo."<p>"Now? Are you crazy?" cried the Knight as she glanced over her shoulder and out the door.<p>"We'll be fine." Captain Scarlet strolled outside into the angry darkness with a nervous party following after them. There would be no sailing from this port tomorrow either.<p>Ukyo hung back and looked back at the horrified sailors. They were muttering and disoriented still. She could hear many familiar tales being told at once.<p>"The Queen of Pirates, Captain Scarlet of the Scarlet Rose. Said to be crewed by demons that leave no survivors behind in their raids."<p>She rushed out the door and saw them walking along a lone empty pier out over the increasing anger of the water.<p>The redhead smiled as she held up her hand and stretched out her fingers over the swirling torrent. Ryuu was the only one who didn't stumble back as the sea began to boil and a sick green glow began to shine from deep below.<p>Ukyo screamed as the hull of a doomed ship blasted up from the waters below. The wood looked rotted and waterlogged, the scarlet sails hung in tatters from the mast and the sound of drum beats and voices of sailors working to bring the ship into port. "What the hell?"<p>A rotted looking plank came down from the deck and Ranma smiled at her in a most disturbing way. She started singing a merry and grizzly song as she strolled up the deck. "What indeed? Yo ho, yo ho, a pirates life for me! We pillage, we plunder, we riffle, and loot! Drink up me hearties ho ho! We kidnap, and ravage and don't give a hoot! Drink up me hearties yo ho!"<p>Ukyo staggered to her feet as she watched the others pass by her onto the boat. Shampoo looked a bit pensive, and Mousse wasn't happy. It was obvious he was moving because of her. Ryuu strolled up the ramp and glanced down at her. "Still coming?"<p>She pushed herself back to her feet and glared at him. "I...have my orders."<p>"Your call." He strolled up the plank and was greeted by a cheer much to large for the people she'd seen climb the plank yet again.<p>She could hear the crew welcoming their captain with a cheerful hearty roar. Shampoo could be heard screaming amongst the uproar. She steeled herself and made her way up the plank.<p>She walked onto the deck paying attention to her footing more than where she was going and stopped. As she looked up her eyes went wide. Around fifteen skeletons dressed in tattered and waterlogged scraps of cloth that had once been sailors clothes. Her heart skipped a beat and she turned back towards the plank, only to find it gone, and the pier moving away towards the rear of the ship.<p>"You'd best get clear of that railing and get below. She won't sink, but these be rough seas. I'd rather not part with my ship to get you back from, Captain Jones."<p>Ukyo whirled around and stared in horror at the storm they were approaching.<p>"Don't worry. This ship is something we got as payment for a job a while back. When things get to hot for us, we go to sea for a while." Ryuu walked up beside her.<p>Mousse was holding Shampoo over his shoulder and glared at his host in annoyance. "Can we get someplace dry?" It was starting to rain.<p>Ryuu sighed and motioned for them to follow. "Yeah. Captain's cabin isn't so bad really."<p>Ukyo growled at this as the skeletons rushed about preparing to sail the rough seas ahead. One of them turned towards the redhead who was now standing at the wheel with a crazed look in her eyes as she steered for the worst looking path she could find. "We be headin for rough seas then?"<p>"Aye," said the elven captain as her lips turned up.<p>"What about her?" Ukyo frowned at Ryuu as he pushed her towards the doors to the captain's quarters.<p>"She's the Captain. She'll be fine. Don't worry so much, nothing on board this ship can hurt you. It's best to just let her be when this happens."<p>"Every time you go to sea?" Ukyo allowed herself to be forced into the cabin with Shampoo and Mousse.<p>Ryuu snorted and sat down at a large table filled with a rather lavish meal. The room was well lit, and seemed to be full of pillows and comfortable places to sleep. "You'll be sleeping in here with us. It's the only place on the ship that's...hospitable for the living."<p>"So we should avoid the lower decks then?" Shampoo arched her eyebrow a little.<p>"If you don't want to spend too much time around the men. You won't die, but I wouldn't count on getting much sleep. It's a bit damp. The ship is old, and it leaks." Their host was munching on an apple and put his other arm behind his head as he leaned back.<p>The knight stared at the table for a moment and frowned. "Where did this come from?" She remembered the ship's rather dramatic entrance quite well.<p>Shampoo was eating a few small fruits and berries from a bowl as she sat down to Ryuu's right. Mousse took up a seat beside her and picked at a roast pork.<p>"I've seen spells that will set up a room like this. Shouldn't be very difficult for someone who could make a ship like this." Shampoo seemed to be enjoying herself. "I've never seen undead before. Gave me quite a start."<p>"I'll say." Ukyo seemed irritated by her cheerfulness.<p>"Relax and eat. We'll be through the storm by the time you wake up tomorrow. You'll be safe in here. I'll take the wheel from Ranma for a while when things calm down. She'll get bored and want some sleep herself once the sea calms." Ryuu closed his eyes and leaned his head back to catch a little sleep himself.<p>"Right. I'm on board a pirate ship full of undead and you want me to sleep?" She glared at the food for a few moments before breaking down and helping herself. It wasn't that she didn't trust the meal, but her view of her situation had changed. She looked at the doorway and furrowed her brow as she bit into the leg of a chicken. "How much can I trust you?"<p>"How quaint." Tatewakii Kuno frowned at the heavily cloaked woman riding beside him and frowned at her reaction.<p>"Most unfortunate it is here that my beloved has chosen to await her beloved. Surely, she would not seek refuge to await her hero, after her glorious victory for the empire has been secured, in this wretched hive of scum and villany..."<p>"Get to the point brother dear." The girl glanced over at him from the folds of her cloak. She seemed cheerful, but her eyes were bloodshot.<p>"This place is more dangerous than even she is aware. I feel I must hasten to wed her in the local chapel, before we are noticed."<p>"I think we should take it somewhere else." She just wished the stupid trollop would hurry up and marry the moron. Maybe then he wouldn't be around so much, and she seemed to enjoy hurting him. It wouldn't be so bad.<p>"Hmmm. Perhaps that would be best. Come, we must hasten to my beloved's side!"<p>"Ahem. We?" The girl was holding her hand against her chest and shook her head. "I only need to see her...Oh, bother..." While she was looking at her brother, she realized that there was little chance of him coming back with Akane Tendo.<p>"Yes, sister?" Kuno looked a little miffed.<p>"I do have to go, how disgusting! She's leaving by ship."<p>"What? Nabiki Tendo predicted no such thing! I am destined to be hers by birthright!"<p>Kodachi snarled at her brother as her eyes grew even more bloodshot. "Do not compare me to that witch!"<p>"Who are you to..." Her brother seemed to realize that it was time to stop talking as his sister's hand came alive with energy.<p>"I am a sorceress brother. See that you do not forget. My gift is natural, it is in my blood."<p>"Magic is magic dear sister. I care not for such musings."<p>"Yes. I noticed that about you."<p>"Then this discussion should end. I have matters to attend."<p>She electrocuted him with an arc of power from her palm and rode away as if nothing had happened. A sigh escaped her lips as her shoulders hung a bit lower. "Oh well. It has been a while since I've seen him after all. You'd better be worth all this trouble, Akane Tendo." She wasn't planning on enjoying her encounter with the brutish knight much.<p>Akane Tendo found herself standing in the morning sun with her eyes half open. She was wearing her armor and looked almost comical as she dragged herself to the group of soldiers that surrounded the outside of her hotel. It was about six in the morning and a light fog drifted through the streets of the sleepy port town. The docks were the only place with any activity, and she was a few streets back into the town.<p>She had arrived in Furinkan the night before, and decided to just buy a room for the night. The weather was nasty and she'd been riding most of the day. In her mind it was time to hit a few bars and start asking around about Ranma, in about three hours. It was as good a place to start as any. She was annoyed at those around her. "This had better be important. I'm not what you'd call a morning person."<p>"I'm afraid you've received orders." The men were wearing the rather flamboyant uniforms of the Royal navy. Red coats and tight fitting blue pants. With frills from every possible opening in the uniform. Even their socks had frills. Each of them was armed with a sword and stood at attention in neat rows on either side of their commanding officer. He was handing the knight a rolled up parchment.<p>She snatched it away and opened it. Her eyes grew wider as her frown deepened. "Who gave you this?"<p>"The magistrate." The man looked neither afraid nor disrespectful. "It has the Emperor's signature on it. I'm afraid it's quite real."<p>"I am not a sailor. You can't just draft passing knights into your ranks. I am hunting..."<p>"Aloha!"<p>The Knight stopped talking quite suddenly as the strangest thing she'd ever seen appeared behind the man she was speaking to. Her jaw hung open a little as the snowman bounced up and down and turned to look at her. "As of dis very moment, you be huntin da pirates!"<p>"Wha...?" If she wasn't mistaken, it had a tiny palm tree growing from it's head. Then it seemed to hit her. "Pirates? Are you joking? I don't have time for this foolishness!" She waved the parchment in his face for a moment. "Where is the man who wrote this. I'm going to speak with him so I can tell him to shove it up his..."<p>"You don't have that authority, Miss Knight." A small and sunny voice piped up from the other side of the officer. He was standing at attention and looking quite nervous.<p>Akane turned to glare at the new source of irritation for her. It was a young girl, also wearing a navy uniform. "Okay. I'm starting to see why you might need help with something as stupid as pirates."<p>"These aren't normal pirates, and we aren't taking you to crew the ship." The girl as she frowned and wagged her finger at her.<p>Akane was fuming mad. "What do you mean? Stop scolding me you child!"<p>"I'm not as young as I look." The girl's irises narrowed and Akane realized she wasn't looking at a human. "I'm Captain Hinako, of the battleship F-1!" She looked quite adorable as she put her fists up under her chin and almost squealed with cuteness.<p>The knight lowered her head and sighed. She glared at the girl without lifting her head up and spoke again. "What do you mean? What kind of pirates?"<p>"We not be believin in silly stories, Lil Wahinee. Dis bein regular pirates."<p>"Stories?" They had a bit more of her attention now.<p>"Yes. We're hunting the Queen of Pirates. Captain Scarlet herself, she's sailing in these waters once again. We received word last night."<p>"We should have left den!" cried the snowman.<p>The men around him swallowed and resisted the urge to take a step back.<p>"We wouldn't have had this knight with is if we had. It was better to wait, just like I told you!" The girl stuck her tongue out and pulled down her eyelid at the snowman.<p>"Captain Scarlet? This is just getting weird." The armored girl was getting frustrated and confused.<p>One of the sailing men who had gathered in the doorway to watch the exchange spoke up. He was glaring at her with one good eye and hiding behind the door frame of the inn as he spoke. It was as if he was afraid she'd appear and destroy him. "Captain Scarlet! She's a demon's what she is! She raids ships and leaves only pieces of crewmen in her wake! Her ship, the Scarlet Rose is crewed by demons. They burn entire towns in their wake, and leave but ravaged widows bodies in a grizzly pyre! Some says she's the bride of Davey Jones himself! His red-haired, blue-eyed, elven bride."<p>Akane Tendo stared back at the man with her jaw hanging a bit. She closed her mouth and glared at the snowman and his very small Captain. She dropped the parchment to the ground and glared at them both. "Let's go. You'd better be ready to sail after waking me up this way."<p>"Yeah. I be takin care o' dis one personally." The snowman started to frown as it gave the girls a dead coal eyed stare.<p>Akane noted that every sailor hand gone pale as a ghost, and the diminutive Captain looked very put off as well. A voice from behind forced the knights resolve.<p>"Wait! Unhand that maiden! Akane Tendo! Weep for joy, for your prince has arrived!"<p>Akane Tendo had grabbed the captain under her arm and snagged the snowman by his palm tree the moment she heard the voice. She was running at full sprint with the confused and alarmed sailors just behind them. "Which ship is it?"<p>"Um, the one at the other end of the docks, the last one..." The girl looked like she was getting jolted around a little.<p>"Great..." Akane didn't look pleased to hear that and pushed a little harder.<p>"Lady Akane!" Lime and Mint rushed up to them from behind keeping pace rather easily with the fleeing girl and her cargo.<p>"You should have woken us up!" said Lime as he rubbed at his eyes.<p>"Yeah. What's going on? What's Lord Kuno doing here?"<p>The girl heaved her two passengers onto the deck of the ship from where she was standing on the dock. A small palm tree and a frightened pair of child like eyes peered over the railing as she scrambled up the deck. The crew was just behind her. "Get us the hell out of here now!" The knight was holding her sword over her shoulder. The beast men landed on the deck just behind their new master.<p>"Is something wrong, Lady Akane?" Mint was trying his best to identify the threat that had alarmed his master so much.<p>"Right away!" Hinako jumped to her feet and saluted as she scurried up to the wheel and stood on the small wooden box that had been nailed in front of it. She started calling out orders to the panicked sailors.<p>Ukyo Kuonji awoke with a start. She was lying on a large pile of pillows with her spear resting on the ground next to her. She could see she was alone, not surprising since she was the last one awake besides Ranma. She was kind of surprised she couldn't see her in the room. The lights were all put out, and only a small crack in the curtains over the windows in the aft allowed any of the sun's brightness into the cabin.<p>She rubbed at her eyes and turned to look at the doors. She wasn't looking forward to going back out there with all the skeletons. She also didn't want to spend the entire voyage locked up in the cabin. She was a knight, and she had to go out and face it. She'd never seen undead, and it was damned unsettling. Ranma Saotome was looking worse and worse as time went by. She wasn't sure if she could trust him, or his partner. She felt bad about thinking about it, but she missed Ryoga a little. She wasn't even sure if she was being used herself or not.<p>"Great." She pushed herself to her feet and walked over to the door. She gripped the handle and stood there. "C'mon. You're getting rattled, cut it out. I'm a knight damn it." She pulled it open and stepped out onto the deck.<p>It was beautiful. The sky was clear, with only a few wispy clouds high in the air overhead. The sea stretched out in every direction. The crew worked around her, all looking quite healthy and alive. The ship looked better as well, still a little under kept, but seaworthy.<p>"Good morning." Ranma seemed almost sunny, but something cunning was lurking beneath her light tone.<p>She gasped and whirled around to see the elven redhead standing at the wheel with her eyes on the sea ahead. "It only looks that way at night. These men died long ago, now they sail for me."<p>"What is this? How did you get your hands on such an awful ship?" Ukyo looked horrified with him.<p>"Who hear among ye doesn't swear upon his mothers grave that he doesn't wish to be here sailin with Captain Scarlet, aboard the Scarlet Rose? The most feared pirates that 'er sails these seas?"<p>Ukyo jumped a little at the enthusiastic roar of the pirate crew. It seemed to cheer them up a little to voice it. "What in god's name?"<p>"Payment, for a job well done. We are for hire after all." Ranma kept her eyes on the horizon. "From one Captain David Jones himself."<p>"Davey Jones hired you?" She didn't look like she believed him.<p>"Yer, standin on the proof ain't ya?" She seemed to be enjoying the conversation.<p>"So. This is it then? This is what you've become? A thug for hire, pirate, and thief?" Ukyo had a sad look on her face as she hung her head a little.<p>The redhead gave her a miffed looking glance and snorted. "That about sums it up. Yeah."<p>"What about your name?" she turned away. "Does it still mean nothing to you?"<p>The redhead's lips turned down into a deep scowl and the knight could see her knuckles grow tighter as she gripped the wheel. "No. It means everything. I shall have my revenge against the ones who stole my life. All of them."<p>This took the knight by surprise and she whirled around to face the girl. She was steering the ship again, looking out into the horizon. Kuonji's lip turned up a little. "That's what you wanted with that knight isn't it? I don't think the emperor is the one you really want. It has something to do with that girl doesn't it?"<p>Ranma continued to sail and glanced over at her as if she'd just noticed she was still there. "I'm sorry, did you say something? I kind of sailed off for a moment."<p>"Fine." Ukyo turned and stomped away.<p>"Wonder what that was about?" Mousse was leaning against the railing watching the ocean go by. It was kind of nice, something big enough to see well in the light. His glasses were different though, now tinted almost black. It didn't help his focus much, but it would keep him from getting headaches. His only reason for suffering with it was gone now.<p>Shampoo was standing by the mast watching the undead go by. They all looked young and healthy, a strange thing in a zombie. "This is quite a ship."<p>"You shouldn't be so trusting." Her guardian seemed to be getting irritated with her.<p>"I don't see what the big deal is. His undead are rather healthy..." She was looking around at the crew, and you couldn't tell they were dead by looking.<p>"Do you realize what you just said?" He turned away and hit his fist against the railing. It wasn't hard enough to break it, but a few splinters broke loose under his knuckles.<p>"She's not evil." The princess turned up her nose and put her back to him.<p>"What would you know of it?" Mousse glared at her over his shoulder.<p>"More than you might think. She's so peaceful right now, I don't think this ship is making her act that way. It doesn't feel like that kind of place. I'm quite relaxed here."<p>"What do you mean?" It was obvious he was having trouble following her now. Strange, for one who had lived among elves so long.<p>"I'm safer here than I was in that tunnel with you Mousse. You remembered how to open that door, and I do not trust you." Her cheerful smile turned into a harsh looking glare as she eyed him and walked around to the other side of the mast.<p>Ranma seemed unaware of anything around her as she gazed off into the horizon. Ryuu was walking up next the uncomfortable looking Ukyo. She was leaning against the railing watching Mousse watch the water. Shampoo was leaning against the mast doing much the same as she looked past the knight into the horizon.<p>"Nice to see you've decided to join us." He seemed irate with his partner as he glared up at her for a moment.<p>"I've decided no such thing!" She turned her anger towards him, but backed off at the grin she got in response.<p>"Not quite what I meant. I can see you're still a bit upset..." He leaned against the railing just out of her reach beside her.<p>"This trip has been full of unexpected things." She glanced up at the redhead for a moment and frowned back at her first mate.<p>"You get a lot of that with us I'm afraid." He didn't look happy with his partner either, but no more than usual.<p>"So it would seem." She pursed her lips a bit and leveled her eyes on him for a moment.<p>"Look, it's not all bad. We'll have a nice quiet voyage..."<p>"Heh. She's catching up." Ranma glanced over her shoulder with a strange smirk on her face. "We'll be busy soon."<p>"Or not..." muttered Ryuu as he started grinding his teeth in frustration.<p>"What do you mean?" Ukyo pushed off the railing along with Mousse and Shampoo to look back at the captain as she steered.<p>"The Imperial Navy of course. Wouldn't be much of a pirating voyage without them would it?" Ranma seemed to think it was a good thing.<p>"Are you crazy? They'll..." She looked down at the ship under her and frowned. "What? You mean..."<p>"When things get to hot for us on land, we go to sea for a while. Pretty much do the same thing we always do." Ryuu shrugged his shoulders and walked through the now bustling undead sailors. They were pulling ropes and preparing the ship for combat.<p>"This is where things get interesting Kuonji." Ranma hopped down after waving one of the crewmen over to take the wheel.<p>"You've gone mad!" She backed away from her and almost stumbled over a few barrels. She caught herself on them and glared up at the pirate captain from under her hair. "I'm no pirate. I won't fight for you!"<p>"Neither are we," agreed Mousse. Shampoo was silent, but didn't look like she disagreed with him.<p>"Heh. You still don't understand. I've been fighting this war for years. Fortune has seen fit to give us the same enemy, and I intend to show them hell itself. Saffron may not be the one I want the most, but I will have my revenge none the less." She stomped back up to the wheel with a most intimidating glare. "Your country is at war with them as well, little more than a band of rebels yourselves anymore. We can cause quite a bit of damage to their supply line at sea, and that could aid your countrymen abroad." She looked down at Ukyo and found the girl staring at the deck with wide eyes.<p>"You..." Her voice trailed off as she struggled to find a response. "I can't..."<p>"I'm afraid you've got little choice at this point. They aren't the only ones gaining ground you know. We've almost caught our prey as well." Her eyes narrowed a little as she nodded towards the horizon.<p>The knight turned and could see nothing. It took her a moment to realize they'd been chasing something for some time now. It was what had the elven girl's attention, and she had a pretty good idea what it was. Saffron's people were waging war all over the main continent. The people of his kingdom were said to have wings, but supplies needed to be shipped in.<p>Ranma noticed the internal struggle and smirked a little. "Kuonji. Time to face facts. Fate has made us allies, when we should have been enemies. Whether or not you think I'm a good person is irrelevant right now. The question is, can you sail under the command of a pirate, or can't you?"<p>Kuonji nodded her head and turned to look out at the sea again. It wasn't something that made her feel much better, but she was right. "A pirate's life for me then."<p>Ranma nodded and grinned as her eyes locked onto the distant horizon then. "Heh. Yo ho."<p>One of the crew walked up and put his hand on her shoulder, it was cold, but comforting at the same time. "Beggin yer pardon, but pirate be a liberal term miss."<p>"I've heard stories, that you leave no survivors, and that this crew..." She shied away a little, but not enough to escape his hand.<p>"Be demons, aye. If there be no survivors, I wonder where them stories come from?" He chuckled and walked away to continue his duty. "All the towns we 'er been to still stand as well. Seems odd, since we burn em all to embers in our wake as well. Ne'r mind all the poor ravaged young girls we undead leave behind..." He smirked as she relaxed a bit.<p>On the distant horizon, she could see a tiny speck of white that she knew would soon grow into the sails of an Imperial ship. "I suppose you couldn't."<p>"Get her into the cabin drow, and stand guard on the door. I'm afraid the terms of our contract won't allow me to let her in on much of the fun. Best do it now, things are going to get rather busy up here."<p>Mousse looked about ready to attack her, but a glance around at the Pirate Queen's undead crew put a stop to it. "Come on."<p>"I'm glad that's settled then." Shampoo seemed rather pleased with that development.<p>"And me?" The knight frowned at the captain and shouldered her spear.<p>"For the honor of Joketzuko, and the fall of an Empire?" The redhead laughed and started barking orders to the crew.<p>Ukyo looked back and smirked a little despite herself. "A pirate, and a thief, I have to admit he's never been boring."<p>"Not in the time I've known him." Ryuu moved passed her and clapped her on the shoulder before moving away to fulfill his own duties.<p>She shook her head and looked out at the horizon once again. The sails were growing larger as they crept ever closer. "Yo ho, indeed." As much as she hated to admit it, she wouldn't be a knight anymore if Saffron won. Her country would no longer exist, and if she fulfilled her duty as she should, neither would she.<p>Akane Tendo stood on the deck of the F-1. It was an imperial warship with more than twenty five guns hidden away in the hull. Two smaller navy ships moved across the sea just behind them as fast as the wind would take them. Behind her, Lime and Mint stood silent guard, keeping Kuno at bay with little trouble. The recent demise of their master had shortened their temper a bit, and it didn't take much to convince him it would be better to come back later. She'd almost thrown him overboard more than once, but stopped after she'd been told they'd have to circle back and get him. It was a delay she couldn't afford. Her mind was busy working over her problem and her prey. Sitting beside her was the Kuno's sister, and she was humming a song to herself as she watched the sea. The child was steering the boat, and the snowman had vanished into the captain's quarters. After several minutes of silence, the black knight spoke up. "What do you want?" The pair had been on horseback, and despite her efforts, the ship was unable to leave port fast enough. Hinako had told her she didn't have the authority to deny either of them access to the ship. So long as it didn't interfere with official orders.<p>"I'm not certain yet. You've made an enemy of your sister. I might be useful, if you are that is." The Lady, Kodachi Kuno, pulled out a fan and hid her face behind it as she glanced over at her.<p>Akane smirked at the girl and crossed her arms as she turned around and sat on the railing. "It's none of your business. Stay the hell out of my family..."<p>"Do you think me a fool? I know what it is you face more than you do. Nabiki Tendo's web will entangle her sooner or later. Do you fault me for wanting to tie the strings a little tighter and help her along to her end? I admit don't care for you. You are a bit...gruff, but we may be useful to each other."<p>"I can deal with my own family matters, keep to yourself witch."<p>"I am a sorceress, your sister is a witch. See that you..."<p>"I haven't forgotten, and I see little difference." She returned the girl's angry stare with a calm frown and walked away from her.<p>"Ugh. Horrid brute." Kodachi was flustered and fanned herself for a few moments as she turned away.<p>Kuno was on the move as soon as she was clear of her two guardians. "My love! It is time for you to come into my arms and gaze into the deep blue ocean of my..."<p>His head hit the mast hard enough to crack the wood as her fist came up and nailed him in the face. "Don't speak to me again." Lime and Mint both looked down a his crumpled form and shook their heads in unison as they followed after her.<p>"Ship ahoy! Off the starboard bow! Men overboard!" The man in the crow's nest at the top of the mast called out. "Pirates!"<p>Akane turned her head and gasped as she saw the plume of smoke rising into the air. She rushed up the stairs to where the captain was standing and took the looking glass from her.<p>"Hey! That's mine!" Captain Hinako jumped up and down and waved her arms trying to grab it back from the taller girl as she looked out at the distant smoke.<p>"Ignore them and send word for the E-2 or F-3 to pick them up. I'll not get bogged down rescuing survivors in our wake." She could see debris from a sunken ship, and enough longboats to account for the entire crew. "Seems most survived. Most fortunate..."<p>"Not really, it's usually like this when we chase after the Scarlet Rose." The young captain smiled as the knight handed her back the telescope. "She's gonna make a mess of our shipping routes. It's a real pain."<p>Akane nodded and walked back down to the lower deck without a word. "We'll catch up sooner or later."<p>"Are you sure?" Kodachi smirked at her from behind her fan as she passed.<p>"Yes." The knight continued to walk towards the hold. "Lime, Mint, I'm going to sleep. See to it I'm not bothered." She looked down at the recovering Kuno for a moment before disappearing below deck.<p>Both of them nodded and followed after her.<p>It didn't take Kuno long after he'd recovered to start searching the ship for his beloved again.<p>Lime and Mint weren't much in the mood to deal with him when he arrived.<p>"Stand aside crewmen! I have come to visit Lady Akane! She no doubt expects..."<p>"She expects no one." Mint shifted into his more animal form and growled at him.<p>Lime did the same and drooled a little on the young lord's foot as he bared his fangs. "We are Lady Akane's servants, not crewmen, and we'll allow no man to pass."<p>Mint raked his claws into the hull of the ship and peeled shavings away as he dragged his paw back. He was growling and eying the boy with a disturbing and hungry look about him. "We aren't in a very good mood, it's best not to tempt us. I doubt Lady Akane would be very upset if we made a meal of you."<p>Akane was lying in a hammock behind them reading a book to help her doze off. She was ignoring the situation and seemed to be falling asleep.<p>Kuno stormed out onto the deck and pointed his finger at the small captain. "You there! I demand to speak with the man in charge of this ship at once!"<p>Hinako looked a bit irate, but cheered up as she seemed to remember something and hopped down to the lower deck with the angry lord. "Are you sure?"<p>Kuno was to dumb to notice the looks of absolute horror that surrounded him. Men were diving for cover and hiding behind anything they could. "I must speak to him about some of his unruly crewmen. They bar my path to my true beloved, so that we might lie together this very night!"<p>"Ugh." Hinako looked rather ill. "I doubt any human would enjoy it. If you insist though." She turned and looked at the doors to the captain's cabin. They promptly burst open.<p>"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Captain, what bein de problem?" The man looked ridiculous, he had on a huge pair of tinted glasses, shorts, and a loud, loose fitting, button up, shirt. He was sipping on something inside a coconut half and had a palm tree growing from his hair. Several strings of exotic flowers hung from around his neck as he looked around the deck. "What bein de problem?"<p>Kuno looked up at him and puffed out his chest. "Those beast-men you keep on your crew are..."<p>"We don't have any beast men on our crew. They belong to Lady Akane. Not much we can do."<p>"Not true Lil Wahinee! Magistrate Kuno be makin it all bedda!" The man looked quite proud of himself.<p>"Very good. I expect this shall be taken care of post haste then? I do not wish to be delayed any longer!" Kuno was quite pleased with the way things had turned out.<p>"First, we be shavin dis one's head, den we be givin de bowl cut to de captain!" The magistrate laughed again and pulled out a pair of barber's sheers. "Den we be feelin all bedda!"<p>It was right at that moment, that a horrible realization dawned upon Tatewakii Kuno. Every single man standing around him was dead bald. "What!"<p>"Not this again..." Hinako seemed more annoyed than anything else and stepped back to prepare for action.<p>TBC...<p>Hey. I finished something!
