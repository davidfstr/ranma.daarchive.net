</div>The Dragon and The Ghost<p>Part 16<p>The way to a beast man's heart...<p>++++++++++++<p>"What?" hissed Akane in shock as she looked at what was in hands.<p>"I said put it on," said Ranma calmly as she undressed herself.<p>"I won't!" snapped Akane with anger in her eyes.<p>"Come on, don't tell me you're scared of a little outfit like<br/>that," said Ranma teasingly.<p>"This isn't an outfit! It's lingerie!" snapped Akane angrily.<p>Ranma blinked and smiled at her for a moment. "Look, you can stand<br/>here if you want, but I'm going to get out of here. I've got to get<br/>back with the others soon, and I don't want these idiots following us<br/>still." She stood and looked herself over for a moment. It was a thin<br/>material that hid nothing from view. The only cover was a tight thong<br/>under the veil like pants. A small see-through vest, which buttoned in<br/>the front, also hid nothing from view.<p>"I can't believe this," grumbled Akane as she stared at the cloth<br/>in dismay.<p>"Don't tell me you've never used your wiles to get your own way<br/>before," said Ranma with a chuckle.<p>"Not once," snapped Akane in retort. "Certainly not in a fashion<br/>as brazen as this!"<p>"Well you should, you have no idea how much fun it is," said Ranma<br/>with a small wink. The redheaded elf was currently placing a veil over<br/>her face as well. Her outfit was bright orange, making her stand out<br/>even more. The one Akane was holding was a lavender color.<p>"Is this a man or not?" snapped Akane as she watched her sneak<br/>towards the party again. Finally, she clenched her fists, and blushed<br/>heavily as she began to disrobe.<p>++++++++++<p>"Hello, my. Why are you dressed like that young lady? Out looking<br/>for a lover? You are aware of what dance those are for?" said the<br/>elder in shock as Ranma walked up to him with a smirk on her face. The<br/>man was standing on the outskirts of the nightly party, watching<br/>intently. The redheaded elf, was covered in a blanket that was draped<br/>over her shoulders.<p>"No, unfortunately for you, I'm not. This is part of my<br/>distraction plan," said Ranma with a small chuckle.<p>"Distraction?" asked the Gypsy cautiously.<p>"Yes, the man you took in, is a minor noble of the Emperor. He's<br/>the one we're trying to avoid," said the elf calmly.<p>"Then you should leave," said the man with a small frown.<p>"Hardly. I couldn't leave your little village to the mercy of him<br/>and his two beast-men," said the redhead with a cold smile.<p>"Beast-men?" The elder went pail as he looked over at the traveler<br/>and his two companions, looking at the pair on either side of Kuno, it<br/>was now obvious to him that she was right. "How could I not see it?"<p>"Easy, a simple spell that tells you not to notice," replied Ranma<br/>as she watched them with him. "They appear to be ogling your women as<br/>well. How quaint."<p>"What is it that you want?" snapped the man angrily as he glared<br/>at the things that sat within his friends and family. No one seemed<br/>even slightly aware of them.<p>"We can take care of them, quietly, for a hundred pieces of<br/>silver," said Ranma with a smirk. "You just have to move on as soon as<br/>we come back. It won't do for you to be found too near the bodies."<p>"Right," muttered the man as he glanced at her nervously. "You're<br/>robbing me blind you know."<p>Ranma giggled with a strange look in her eyes. "Don't pretend to<br/>be so ignorant. I could easily ask that much in gold for a single<br/>beast-man. I just find silver to be strangely appropriate." She turned<br/>her head, and saw Akane stalking towards her angrily. She was dressed<br/>in the outfit.<p>"Let's just get this over with," said Akane bitterly.<p>"Right," said Ranma with a small smirk as she glanced back at her<br/>companion for a moment.<p>"What are you looking at?" snapped Akane bitterly as she covered<br/>her chest.<p>Ranma chuckled and looked at the elder for a moment. "We're going<br/>to need the help of some of your young women."<p>"Are you sure she's up to this? Your friend doesn't appear to be<br/>very enthusiastic about this," commented the elder.<p>"Trust me," said Ranma with her smirk returning again. She turned<br/>towards Akane and handed her a length of rope. "Hide this behind your<br/>back..."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Tatewaki Kuno sat watching the festivities around him lazily. "How<br/>quaint, the commoners are quite...colorful," said Kuno with a slight<br/>raising of his eyebrow. One of the drunker men became violently sick<br/>in the dirt a few yards away.<p>"Lord Kuno, can we try and talk to some girls?" said Mint with a<br/>nervous twitch forming in his eyes.<p>"Are you not a bit young for such things?" commented Kuno in<br/>surprise.<p>"We've never seen girls like these before," said Lime in<br/>agreement. The women were almost as drunk as the men, and were hanging<br/>off of their chosen men, and in some cases, one another, rather<br/>passionately.<p>Kuno chuckled slightly. "Go, spread the seed of the nobility. I<br/>may choose to give some young maiden the honor of my time as well."<p>Lime and Mint's jaws dropped like lead weights. No one had ever<br/>given them permission before, not even Herb. Tears of joy formed in<br/>their eyes for a moment, and they stood up to rush away.<p>That is, until the crowd parted in front of them, revealing a<br/>small group of younger girls. Most of them in their mid to late,<br/>teens. They formed a messy looking group in front of a bonfire,<br/>spreading out to reveal two very scantily clad women, who were eyeing<br/>them directly.<p>"Woah!" said one of the younger men nearby to Kuno. "I never<br/>thought this'd happen tonight!"<p>"What is going on here?" said Kuno as he turned towards the man<br/>for a moment.<p>"Well, those two girls in the middle. They're signaling to the<br/>whole camp that they're ready to lose their virginity. It's a sort of<br/>tradition, they'll choose the man they wish to couple with tonight."<p>"Pardon? This is some sort of marriage ceremony?" said Kuno with a<br/>slight frown.<p>"No, not marriage. Lust! Passion! We're gypsies remember?" said<br/>the man with a small snort of laughter. "The girls can choose married<br/>men if they wish. Any man she chooses is obligated to spend his<br/>evening with her. After that, they usually go their separate ways.<br/>Marriages that happen because of this are very rare."<p>"Ah, I see," said Kuno with a nod. "No doubt they were smitten by<br/>my noble personage, and sought to bed me upon gazing on my handsome<br/>face. I shall give them a night they shall cherish forever!"<p>"Hey...Mint...you can see...their..." muttered Lime as he stared.<p>"T-t-titties!" stammered Mint.<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma and Akane glared at their targets calmly. "You take the<br/>younger one, Wolf-boy," said the elf girl.<p>"Right, what am I supposed to do? I can't dance," said Akane with<br/>a frown.<p>"Follow my lead and don't worry, you're dressed so skimpily that<br/>none of the men will care," said Ranma firmly.<p>"That's supposed to make me feel better?" snorted Akane.<p>"Focus on the target. It's how I got through this the first time I<br/>had to do something this way," said Ranma in reply. Her tone was<br/>serious, all business, once again.<p>"All right," agreed Akane, slightly comforted by the attitude<br/>change.<p>The music started, a few drums accompanied by flutes, and low<br/>sounding wind instruments.<p>Both girls began to move slowly, curving their arms up and down<br/>their bodies as they writhed like serpents to the music. Ranma was<br/>moving gracefully, lightly. Akane was moving much slower, but still<br/>managed to keep a rather quiet grace about her. It was clear that all<br/>attention was focused on the redhead, and at the moment, that suited<br/>her fine. Akane focused her attention on copying Ranma, hoping for the<br/>situation to end soon.<p>Suddenly, Akane felt a slight daze overcoming her. It was slow,<br/>and crept up on her cautiously. She felt her eyes glaze over, and<br/>staggered for a moment, her head lolling around as if she was in a<br/>drunken state.<p>Ranma paused nearby, still staying with the music, swaying her<br/>hips and moving her belly slowly. Her arms moved up and down her body<br/>as Akane walked up next to her, and began to move in perfect unison.<p>Slowly, the music began to build up tempo. Both of the women moved<br/>faster, writhing like sirens, their hands moving up and down each<br/>other's bodies, and reaching out to the trio of men who sat<br/>dumbfounded, directly in front of them.<p>The music climaxed, bursting into an insane speed. Ranma and Akane<br/>spun around violently, whipping their hair through the air, their<br/>bodies shaking violently as they moved ever closer to the trio.<br/>Finally, the music stopped in an instant, and both girls fell to the<br/>ground in a kneeling bow. Right in front of Lime and Mint.<p>"Huh?" was the unanimous reply to this from both of them.<p>"Oh, how noble I am! That they have both chosen to lose themselves<br/>to me!" said Kuno with tears in his eyes. He was sitting directly<br/>between both beast-men.<p>Lime and Mint almost sighed with relief, it certainly made more<br/>sense than the pair choosing them. That is, until the girls stood up,<br/>and grabbed their hands.<p>"Come with us," they said in unison. "Come."<p>"Heh heh," said Lime nervously.<p>"Who? Us?" agreed Mint with a huge blush on his face.<p>"Hold! Did I give you permission to take these women! You shall<br/>have them after I have given them the honor of..." Kuno was promptly<br/>silenced as both girls slammed their fists into his face, moving as<br/>one.<p>"Hey. I like these girls," said Mint as he watched the unfortunate<br/>noble slump to the ground. He allowed himself to be led away by the<br/>dark haired girl.<p>Akane spared Ranma a dark glare for a moment. As she hit Kuno, the<br/>haze in her eyes seemed to clear finally.<p>The redhead was smirking at her, and gave a small wink as she lead<br/>the tiger-boy away into the woods.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"What are we doing out here?" said Lime nervously as he looked<br/>around. "Hey, can I touch that?" he said as he pointed at her breast.<br/>"I've always wanted to touch one of those..."<p>Ranma frowned as he reached out and grabbed her. "This is far<br/>enough," she thought as she pushed him against a tree, while seeming<br/>to jump into his arms. "Oh! Be gentle with me!"<p>Lime's instinct began to take over, and Ranma felt the fur<br/>starting to grow across the man's chest. He growled and shifted<br/>forward as if to grab her, his movement was stopped by some unseen<br/>force. The redhead jumped back, pulling the veil from her face as she<br/>did so.<p>"Well, well, look what I've caught!" said the elf coolly.<p>"What? You!" snarled Lime angrily. He pulled at the ropes that had<br/>appeared around his torso somehow. "I'll kill you!" snarled the tiger-<br/>man as he struggled.<p>"I wouldn't do that, those are enchanted ropes you know," said<br/>Ranma as she sat down.<p>"What do you mean?" said Lime as he stopped struggling for a<br/>moment.<p>"The more you struggle, the tighter they become," said Ranma with<br/>a small shrug. "If you struggle enough, the string of silver inside<br/>them will cut through the rope."<p>That got the monster's attention. "What?"<p>"You heard me, the only way out of that rope is for you to relax,<br/>and wait for someone to untie you," said the elf coolly.<p>"I'll get you for this thief," said Lime angrily.<p>"Calm down will ya? I'm going to keep your little knight safe for<br/>now, she's safer with me than at the palace."<p>Lime looked away and snorted in disgust. He knew the elf was<br/>right.<p>"You seem to like her, so I'm assuming that you don't want the<br/>Emperor to kill her. Right?"<p>"Fine, go then. We won't lead Lord Kuno to you again," said Lime<br/>in frustration. "Not until you recover the Kajakan. Then we'll hunt<br/>you down, and destroy you."<p>"Oh?" said Ranma with her eyebrow arched.<p>"I know it was you, I was in that dungeon. My nose doesn't lie<br/>like my eyes and ears might," said Lime coldly.<p>"Well, we'll see," said Ranma as she backed away into the shadows.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Lady Akane! It's you!" said Mint as he stared at the woman in<br/>shock. She had removed her veil and was glaring at him.<p>"Shut up and stand against that tree," said Akane coldly.<p>"Right!" said Mint cheerfully. "Thank you for letting me see your<br/>titties! They're very nice!"<p>Akane growled as she began to wrap the rope Ranma had given her<br/>around him. He made a small noise as she pulled it tight for the<br/>comment.<p>"You sure are nice to us!" continued the boy obliviously. "I never<br/>thought I'd really get to see a girl's chest! Most girls won't talk to<br/>us, cause of what we are! It's really hard to get a date, especially<br/>since Lord Herb keeps us so busy!"<p>"Be quiet, I've got something to tell you!" said Akane angrily.<p>Mint blushed and stared at her for a moment. "Oh! You mean you<br/>really do want to...?"<p>Akane hung her head for a moment and clenched her fist in<br/>frustration.<p>A moment later, a dazed looking Mint was slumped against the tree,<br/>being held up by the ropes around him. Several large lumps were<br/>visible on his head, he laughed deliriously for a moment and looked up<br/>at her again.<p>She was leaning against the tree trunk and glaring at him with<br/>barely held back rage. "Listen carefully. I don't have much time."<p>"Okay," said the boy sheepishly. He was watching her breast bounce<br/>as she breathed heavily from the exertion of beating him.<p>"Stop looking at those and pay attention!" she snarled, giving him<br/>another bop on his head.<p>"Right!" said Mint as he looked at her face again.<p>"I have a message for you to deliver to my father. Tell him I am<br/>on the trail of the Kajakan, but I need more time. I have someone who<br/>is delivering me right to it, and I will find a way to signal once I<br/>find out where we are going. Understand?"<p>"Right!" said the boy again as he nodded up and down.<p>"Be careful with those ropes, and wait for Kuno to untie you!<br/>They're enchanted, and can kill you if you struggle," warned Akane as<br/>she walked away.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Ranma and Akane were back in their traveling clothes once again,<br/>standing outside the gypsy camp as they finished loading their camp<br/>away. The moon hung in the sky overhead still, but morning would be<br/>arriving in an hour or so.<p>"Well, we appreciate your services," said the elder with a small<br/>chuckle as he handed Ranma a bag of silver coins. "And the show!" he<br/>winked at the both of them and chuckled.<p>Akane looked at the elf in disbelief. "What?"<p>"One should always look for a way to get paid, even if you're<br/>going to do it for free anyway," said Ranma with a small wink as she<br/>placed half of the coins in her hand.<p>They started walking away from the camp together, Akane was<br/>keeping up the rear. She was sulking again, and glaring at Ranma's<br/>back as she walked.<p>"Oh what is it?" said the elf with a heavy sigh.<p>"What did you do to me back there?" said the knight irritably.<p>"Huh? Oh that," said Ranma with a small wave of her hand. "It's<br/>nothing."<p>"You took control of my body, don't tell me it was nothing," said<br/>Akane angrily.<p>"I didn't," said Ranma as she looked over her shoulder for a<br/>moment and chuckled.<p>"What do you mean? Explain?" said Akane sharply.<p>"All right, jeez. I just hypnotized you, that's all," said Ranma<br/>lazily.<p>"What?" said Akane in shock.<p>"It's a trick I learned a while back. I did a job once, where I<br/>had to sneak into a thieves' guild. I stole a necklace from the guild<br/>master. In order to do so, I hid in his harem. He used to give big<br/>parties, and had his girls dance for him there. I learned how to do<br/>that trick from a young pair of elf girls, named Ling Ling and Ran<br/>Ran. They were working for him at the time."<p>"As slaves?" snorted Akane bitterly.<p>"As prostitutes, they were paid for what they did," replied Ranma<br/>with a small shrug. "He was a rather nice guy for a guild master. I<br/>did a few jobs for him after that."<p>"Disgusting," snorted Akane.<p>"Better than cutting people up with a big sword for a living,"<br/>retorted Ranma.<p>Akane felt a blush rise to her face. "What's that supposed to<br/>mean?" she snapped angrily.<p>"It means it's all a matter of perspective. Some people would<br/>rather do things like that than kill, or starve in the streets,"<br/>replied the elf girl calmly.<p>"Is that why you became a thief, so you wouldn't have to kill?"<br/>snorted Akane lazily.<p>"No, I'm as much of a killer as you are," replied the girl. She<br/>continued to walk forward, not speaking again after that.<p>+++++++++<p>"So? Lime and Mint failed to locate the Kajakan," said Nabiki as<br/>she watched Herb pace back and fourth.<p>"You know as well as I that I never intended for them to retrieve<br/>it," said Herb as he looked up at her.<p>The cold smile on her lips widened somewhat. "An ingenious plan.<br/>Sate the Emperor's suspicions by appearing to seek out his lost<br/>artifact quite intently."<p>"Yes, I'm glad you thought of it," snorted Herb lazily.<p>"The things I do for love," said Nabiki as she wrapped her arms<br/>around his neck playfully.<p>"Love of power," pointed out Herb lazily.<p>"Yes, it is such a turn on," said the girl with a feral looking<br/>grin appearing on her face suddenly. "I'm hungry Herb darling, but<br/>since it isn't time to feast on the Emperor's power just yet."<p>"I may have something to sate your appetite," replied Herb as he<br/>lifted her off her feet.<p>Nabiki responded by biting him on the neck, which made him pause<br/>and let out a low growl. "Planing on letting out the beast inside<br/>you?" she whispered.<p>"You would not survive that," commented Herb.<p>"Hmm, perhaps I should find a way?" she purred. "Would that please<br/>you?"<p>Herb growled again, glaring at her with his golden eyes for a long<br/>moment. "Perhaps I underestimated your worth Tendo."<p>++++++++++++<p>"Well, there it is, the border," said Ryu as he pointed to a<br/>simple road sign ahead of them. It was sitting in the middle of a long<br/>dirt road that twisted through the forest on the edge of Joketsuko.<p>The sun was high in the sky above, hidden by the occasional<br/>passing cloud. It was amazingly good weather, despite the chilling<br/>temperatures only a few miles behind them in the mountains. Even the<br/>types of wildlife around them had changed dramatically. Smaller<br/>animals were visible now, such as squirrels and different types of<br/>birds as well.<p>"What an incredibly boring trip," commented Ukyo.<p>"I'm glad it was," commented Shampoo.<p>"Indeed," agreed Ryoga.<p>"Aren't you ever satisfied?" said Ryu as he crossed his arms and<br/>looked at her.<p>"Well, you were a lot more exciting in Morid," she said with a<br/>small sigh.<p>"Whatever, let's keep going," said Shampoo lazily.<p>"We're going to wait for Ranma," said Ryu calmly.<p>"What?" said the rest of the group in shock.<p>"We're going to wait for Ranma. We're much safer here, and there's<br/>a safe house nearby we can use." said Ryu calmly.<p>"Oh, I get it. This is some sort of plan you two idiots have<br/>worked out," snorted Ryoga.<p>"Right," said Ryu calmly. "Ranma does all of the transactions, and<br/>it looks weird if I show up at the end of a job. He'll be along in a<br/>day or two. If not, we'll go on without him."<p>"Are you sure?" muttered Ukyo nervously.<p>"No, but we've got a job to do, and I know how to find him if we<br/>don't link back up during the job," said Ryu.<p>"Where is this safe house?" snorted Shampoo.<p>"I'll show you, it's a cabin a few miles away from here," said Ryu<br/>as he led them away.<p>++++++++++<p>"What an incredible dump," said Ukyo as she stared at the rickety<br/>old wooden cabin in front of her. It was falling apart, and didn't<br/>look very inviting at all. "This thing must be older than Shampoo!"<p>"Hey!" snapped the elf girl. "What the heck is that supposed to<br/>mean?"<p>"Exactly what it sounds like! You hag!" snarled Ukyo in retort.<br/>The pair was at each other's throats in a moment, each grabbing the<br/>other's collar.<p>"Ranma certainly brings out the best in women," commented Ryoga as<br/>he walked by Ryu.<p>"Right," agreed the human as he opened the door. "Come on, let's<br/>get this cleaned up a bit. I'd rather do it before they come in here<br/>and start fighting over him."<p>++++++++++<p>Almost an hour later, Ryu emerged from the cabin and sat with a<br/>cup of tea in his hands. Ryoga sat down just beside him and shook his<br/>head in disgust.<p>Both women were still locked in combat, each covered in dirt and<br/>bruises, but neither appearing to have the upper hand. They had kept<br/>the contest purely physical so far, and had yet to resort to weapons<br/>or magic. Finally, they slumped down against each other.<p>"I'll get you next time, sugar!" gasped Ukyo.<p>"You're a hundred years too slow to beat me!" countered Shampoo.<p>"Hag!"<p>"Tomboy!"<p>"Witch!"<p>"Man impersonator!"<p>"That's enough damn it!" said Ryu as he walked up between them,<br/>pushing them away from one another with an almost casual air about<br/>him. "He's not even here right now. You two are impossible!" With that<br/>said he turned away and walked back into the cabin, followed by the<br/>disgusted looking Ryoga.<p>Both girls looked at one another and blushed.<p>"This is all your fault you know," said Ukyo.<p>"My fault? You started this!" snapped Shampoo.<p>+++++++<p>Inside the cabin, Ryoga sat up and grumbled. He was lying on his<br/>futon and glaring at the door. "Again?"<p>"Just ignore them, get some rest," muttered Ryu as he pulled his<br/>blanket a little. "They'll wear each other down eventually."<p>++++++++++<p>A short time later, outside the cabin, Shampoo and Ukyo were both<br/>lying on the ground with their hands gripped firmly around each<br/>other's throats. Both had their eyes closed, and were muttering<br/>insults under their breath as they slept.<p>"Hussy."<p>"Tramp."<p>"Slut."<p>"Bitch..."<p>+++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: The reunion.<p>I felt like being nice this time, and cut this one off before it<br/>became a cliffhanger. Oh well. Don't expect this too happen again<br/>anytime soon, as things are about to pick up again.<p>
