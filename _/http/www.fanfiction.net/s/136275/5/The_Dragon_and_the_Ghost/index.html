</div><br/>The Dragon and The Ghost<p>Part 5<p>A Knight of Bahamut.<p>Ranma walked with an annoyed scowl on his face. Ryoga had managed to stay with them for almost a week now. The little dwarf refused to let him out of his sight. Shampoo hung back with Ryu for most of the time, while Ryoga walked in the middle of the group just behind them.<p>"Don't you have somewhere else to be?" Ranma asked the diminutive man as he spun around and glared at him.<p>"No," snorted the dwarf in reply.<p>"Give it up Ranma, we're stuck with him. No thanks to you I might add," commented Ryu lazily.<p>"Well, we've just crossed the border to Joketsuko. We should be in the mountains in about half a day or so," commented Shampoo as she ignored their constant squabbling. The pair had come to blows several times over the course of the past few days. Ranma always won of course, but Ryoga would be on his feet a few moments later, and just as irritable as ever.<p>"Great. That dwarven village should be near the base of the mountains. I think we can make it by nightfall."<p>"Planning to buy supplies?" asked Ryoga with a snort. "You weak humans aren't dressed for the weather in this area. You'll both freeze before we reach Morid."<p>"We've dealt with worse. There's no need to try it again though, we've got enough that we should be able to buy some warmer clothing," said Ryu.<p>"Let's get going," said Ranma as he started forward again.<p>++++++++++++<p>A short time later they came upon a small village. It was a human habitation nestled within the hills. It was mostly a few wooden shacks, mixed in with various shops and bars.<p>"We could buy clothes here," commented Shampoo as she noticed a clothing store with coats and furs in the window.<p>"Dwarven clothes will keep us warmer. These humans spend most of their time indoors. They mine the mountains near here, but their coats aren't really made for traveling through the mountains. Dwarves live in the cold and travel across the terrain regularly. I'll admit they spend more time in the caves at home though." Ryoga proudly boasted about the dwarven goods they could buy later.<p>Ranma sighed. "As much as I hate to admit it, he's right."<p>A voice halted the group. "Travelers! Hold!"<p>The group turned to see a figure standing behind them. He was dressed in silver armor and had a white cloth draping across the front of his armor with a black dragon embroidered across it. A heavy looking lance about twice the size of him rose into the air with a shining silver blade on top of it.<p>"Who the heck are you?"<p>"I am a Knight of Bahamut. You must remain in this village for a time I'm afraid. The passage to the north has been blocked."<p>"So what? We'll manage," snorted Ranma lazily.<p>"You do not understand sir, passage has been ordered halted by the order of the Knights of Bahamut. You must remain here by the authority of the Queen herself." The figure stepped towards them.<p>"We don't have time to wait for you to move a rock slide," snapped Shampoo. "We are on a mission for the Elder of the Forest Elves."<p>"Your companions are dressed as thieves," noticed the armored figure.<p>"What of it? We haven't stolen anything from this village," said Ranma casually. "We don't have time for these delays."<p>"I see. However, it is no rockslide that bars your path. The goblins of the northern reaches have created a roadblock. Their master is said to be a powerful beast as well. I ask that you wait until we have vanquished them before you proceed. It is for your own safety." The knight was quite insistent and lowered his spear.<p>"I don't see any other knights in this village," said Shampoo. "It does not appear to be garrisoned either. Are you planning to vanquish these goblins alone?"<p>"What of it?" said the knight with a casual wave of his hand.<p>"Even the greatest knight cannot hope to vanquish an entire legion of goblins on his own. I think our wait will be far too long."<p>"Reinforcements approach from Morid. They will be here in three days," admitted the knight. "I have assessed the situation and prevent travelers from moving on since the danger is too great. Surely you noticed the caravans that lie outside the village. They are waiting for the road to clear before moving on."<p>"I thought I saw a few large camps on the other side of town when we approached," said Ryu.<p>"Does it matter? We can sneak by a few goblin troops without any problems," said Ranma lazily.<p>"You are fools to continue," said the knight with a warning tone.<p>"Bah! Things like this are what I do for a living." Ranma dismissed him and started walking again.<p>The knight watched them for a moment. "I cannot allow that," he said finally.<p>"You plan to stop us?" said Ranma with his eyebrow cocked. Ryu growled and stood behind him.<p>"Ranma, perhaps it would be wise to wait. I don't want to fight if we don't have too. We do have two more weeks to reach Morid," said Shampoo as she put herself between them.<p>The knight went rigid. He lowered his lance until the tip was almost touching the ground. "Your name is Ranma?"<p>"What of it?" said the thief as he leveled an evil looking glare at Shampoo.<p>"It cannot be," whispered the knight as he took a step forward. "You are dead!"<p>Ranma lowered his hands slightly and paused. "Who are you? What do you know of me?"<p>"Ranchan... is it really you?"<p>The thief's eyes went wide. He jumped back and lowered his defense immediately. "I know you. You! It can't be!"<p>The group stood and watched the pair in confusion. Ryu walked up to his partner and grabbed his shoulder. "You know this guy?"<p>"Ucchan? I hadn't thought about it in years. We were... best friends."<p>The knight removed his helmet and rushed up to Ranma throwing his arms around him. His long brown hair was tied in a ponytail and fell down his back. He was as young as Ranma was. "It is you! How can it be? How did you survive? I feared the worst when I heard of your father's death! Everyone thought you had died with him!"<p>Ranma's face softened. "I almost did. How have you been Ucchan?"<p>"How do you think? I became a Knight of Bahamut!" The young knight laughed. "Just like we imagined ourselves when we were young. It was our dream to be the greatest knights."<p>Everyone looked at Ranma. The boy scratched the back of his head and laughed uncomfortably. "Well, we were just kids then, after all."<p>"Come on! I'll buy you dinner! You must tell me what happened! Why are you disguised as a thief? What country do you work for?" The man began to drag Ranma away by his arm.<p>+++++++++<p>The whole party sat around a table inside a rather clean looking restaurant. Ukyo beamed as he sat next to his old friend "We were such good friends! When we were children Ranma and his father came to stay with my family and me. They were there for about a year. I believe Uncle Genma was teaching him his family school of martial arts at the time. Ranma and I would spend many happy hours playing in the courtyard pretending we were knights. Oh, such happy memories. I never truly intended to become a knight to tell the truth."<p>Ranma sunk lower into his chair as she told her story. Both Ryoga and Ryu were giving him amused stares. "That was a long time ago."<p>Ukyo's face hardened suddenly. "When I heard that he and his father had been killed, I became driven to fulfill our childhood dream. I began to train to become the greatest knight. That way I could honor his memory and fulfill his dream." She turned to look at him. "I'm glad I did it, even though you are still alive."<p>"I see. Well partner, it seems you've been holding back on me," snorted Ryu crudely.<p>"I think it's rather beautiful," said Shampoo as she gave the embarrassed Ranma a sympathetic smile.<p>"I hoped you'd think that!" agreed Ukyo cheerfully. "Tell me Ranchan, how are things? What country do you serve?"<p>Everyone at the table was at a loss for words. "I uh..." stammered Ranma.<p>"Don't tell me, you are not a knight?" Ukyo looked concerned. "Have you not been able to? Surely, the loss of your family has not prevented it? I understand. I would be glad to help you obtain a position with the Knights of Bahamut! Just say the word!"<p>Ryu fell over in his seat with laughter. Ryoga quickly followed behind him, even Shampoo was having trouble keeping her amusement disguised.<p>"Hey! It ain't funny damn it!" snapped Ranma irritably. He turned towards his old friend and sighed. "Look Ucchan, I'm not a knight. I don't really want to be one. I'm on an important mission right now though. I need to get through that pass. I can take care of myself, a few hundred goblins ain't nothing for me to worry about."<p>Ukyo's face fell slightly at his words. "Oh, I see. Surely you are a formidable warrior to boast that way though."<p>Ryoga nodded at this. "He's strong enough to stand up to a dwarf bare handed. I don't care for him much, but I'll admit that for him at least."<p>Ukyo was impressed. "That is high praise indeed."<p>"He's done nothing that warrants high praise," commented Ryu lazily. Ranma kicked him in his shin under the table and glared at him.<p>All of a sudden the Knight seemed embarrassed. "Oh, I apologize. I have been incredibly rude! I am Ukyo Kuonji, Knight of Bahamut."<p>Ryu seemed to freeze and stared at her. "Did you just say Kuonji?"<p>He looked at him and smiled. "That is correct. Ranma, why don't you introduce me to your companions."<p>The pigtailed thief sighed and nodded. "This is Ryu Kumon, my long time partner. These two are Shampoo, the princess of the forest elves." Shampoo nodded her head. "And this fat fool is Good Fang. A dwarven blacksmith."<p>"Oi," said Ryoga as he took a large gulp of ale.<p>"My. Quite impressive Ranchan," said Ukyo.<p>"You're the knight who slew Taimaht? The dragon lord?" Everyone looked at Ryu as he said this.<p>"I wasn't alone, I had a lot of help," replied the knight modestly.<p>"Hey! That's great Ucchan!" said Ranma as he slapped the man on his back.<p>"Not really, only two of us survived that encounter," said the man with a heavy sigh.<p>"Oh," said Shampoo as she put her hand over her mouth. "I remember that story. Quite tragic."<p>"Yes. Only myself, and my squire survived," agreed the man.<p>"Squire?" Ranma looked up at her and blinked.<p>"Yes. His name is Konatsu. He is quite strange, but very capable." The knight blushed for a moment.<p>"Is he here?" said Ranma without thinking.<p>"Yes, he is resting at the moment. We have a room here. I'd like it if you stayed as well, if only for tonight. I believe that you can get through those goblins, if only because it is you. You were always the better warrior between us."<p>Everyone looked at Ranma for a moment. "Thanks Ucchan. I don't see why not. We could all use a real bed for the night I suppose."<p>"Bah! What's wrong with the ground?" snapped Ryoga.<p>"You can sleep outside if you want too," said Shampoo as she leveled her gaze on him.<p>"What? Aren't there enough trees out there for you?" retorted the dwarf.<p>Shampoo turned her nose up at him and snorted.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Late that evening, Ranma stood watching the stars again from the open window of his room. He and Ukyo had agreed to share a room together. Konatsu had not awaken and was sleeping in his own room. Despite the road block, the hotels were not crowded. They had managed to secure enough rooms to hold everyone. Most of the blocked travelers were merchants, they opted to camp out with their goods rather than leave them alone.<p>"I love the stars," commented Ranma with a wistful look on his face.<p>"Yes, they are beautiful," agreed Ukyo. He was sitting in a small wooden chair beside him. "Ranchan, I've missed you."<p>"I know Ucchan. I'm sorry," he hung his head slightly.<p>"You could have come to my family for refuge you know. We would have been glad to take you in."<p>"To tell the truth, I haven't had much time to think about my past. It never occurred to me to look for you."<p>"I see, you had forgotten then," the man hung his head slightly.<p>"No, I thought about the two of us a lot. Just never in that way, you know? I'll always be your friend Ucchan. I've just been so busy, just surviving was a lot of work at first."<p>"I... understand. I still love you Ranchan."<p>"Huh?" Ranma's head turned so fast he almost snapped his neck.<p>"I used to think about the way it would be if you lived. The promise you made to me so long ago. You said you'd always protect me."<p>Ranma relaxed slightly. "Well, you don't really need it now, do you?"<p>"How can you say that?" snapped the man angrily.<p>"Huh? What did I say? You're a knight now! That must mean you're real strong right?"<p>"Damn you, Ranma!" The man grabbed him by the head and kissed him full on the lips. Ranma froze in shock and felt a tongue probe his mouth.<p>Ukyo released him and stepped back. "I still want you to keep your promise. Make me a woman tonight Ranchan!"<p>"How the hell am I supposed to do that?" cried the repulsed and shocked Ranma as he backed away.<p>Ukyo removed his armor, dropping it to the floor beside him, and then pulled open his shirt... her shirt. "I still want you to keep your promise Ranchan."<p>Ranma's mind went into shock. He fell to his knees and simply stared at the girl's breast. He could not think of anything to say or do. He slowly stood up and reached out with his finger. He poked her chest, as if to be certain they were real. "I uh..."<p>"Oh Ranchan!" Ukyo flung her arms around his neck and kissed him again. This time there was no revulsion, only pure and uncertain confusion. Ranma staggered back and fell into a table. A pitcher of water left for washing toppled over and landed on his head.<p>A blood curdling scream awakened everyone in the inn.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ryu stood in the doorway with Shampoo and Ryoga staring at the scene in shock.<p>"Jusenkyo? A place with cursed springs?" Ukyo looked confused. She still had her pike pointed at Ranma from across the room. The poor red-haired elf girl had her back to the wall and was shaking uncontrollably.<p>"That's right," said Ryu with a small nod. He had yet to take his eyes away from the girl's chest. "Um, You're not a guy?"<p>Ukyo finally noticed her unclothed state. "Auuuggghhh!" Ryu ducked under a thrown vase and quickly vacated the room. Ryoga followed quickly behind them.<p>"Kuonji, please calm down," said Shampoo as she stepped forward.<p>"You get out too! Pervert!" screamed Ukyo as she covered her chest.<p>"I am not cursed!" snapped Shampoo angrily. She pulled open her own shirt and showed it to the girl.<p>Ranma's eyes became locked in place. "I see nothing. I'm a girl too. I see nothing..."<p>Shampoo glared at Ranma for a moment and covered herself again.<p>"All right. So what is this? What the hell is going on?"<p>"It happened when Pop was killed," said the redhead. She looked away from them and finally managed to stand up again. "Look, I'm going to stay with Ryu tonight. We can talk about this later."<p>The two girls nodded at this. Ranma closed the door behind her.<p>+++++++++<p>"Ranma! You old dog! I never knew you had it in you!" roared Ryu. He slapped his partner on her back and chuckled.<p>"Bah! How could you? That woman ain't got no meat on her! Not even a single hair on her chest! Nothin to grab on too!"<p>Ranma and Ryu looked at him for a moment and turned away in disgust.<p>"Look. I thought she was a guy! All these years, I never knew! She was a real tomboy when we were little!"<p>"So, you told her you'd marry her?" Ryu raised his eyebrow slightly.<p>"I didn't mean it that way! I thought she was a guy, and we were good friends! She was always asking if we'd be together forever, and if I'd protect her when we got older. I didn't think she meant it like that!"<p>"But, you did tell her these things? Right?" Ryu smirked and leaned back on one of the beds. Ryoga was already spread out on the floor. Ranma was sitting on the other bed and looking at the ceiling in frustration.<p>"Yeah. How the hell am I going to get out of this?" Ranma fell onto her back and lay spread out on the sheets.<p>"Do you want to? She didn't look that bad to me," commented Ryu.<p>"You shut up! That's my best friend!" snapped Ranma as she sat up.<p>"Well, what are you going to do about her?" asked Ryu calmly.<p>"Run like hell, that's what. We've got a mission. I'll just take off and not come back after it's over."<p>"Great plan," said Ryoga with a satisfied nod. "I did the same thing a few years ago. If the wench ever finds me again, I'll just tell her I got lost."<p>"You see! Ryoga's been following us for about four years now! It'll work!"<p>Ryu shrugged and lay back down on the sheets. "Your funeral."<p>"So, you are a coward after all," Everyone in the room jumped up as a new figure stood in the doorway. It was a young girl of about sixteen. She had long black hair and was dressed in a simple looking dress. A short sword hung off of her back.<p>"Who the hell are you?" snapped Ranma.<p>"I am Konatsu, lady Ukyo's squire."<p>The men looked at each other for a moment. Finally, Ryu spoke up. "How long have you been standing there?"<p>"Long enough. I like your plan. It will hurt her, but she'll get over it. I couldn't stand the thought of her being with a coward like you. I'll allow it, just this once. Normally I'd kill anyone who would hurt her like that. I don't think she'd like that very much right now."<p>"I'm glad you agree," snorted Ranma angrily.<p>"If I ever see you again after that, I will kill you."<p>"I don't think you're strong enough for that little girl," commented Ryu lazily.<p>"I'm stronger than I look," replied the girl.<p>"Konatsu... Ukyo mentioned you. Wait a minute... you're a guy?" Ranma turned green and stared at the figure in the doorway.<p>"So are you."<p>"Not at the moment kid," snorted Ranma as she thrust out her chest.<p>Konatsu narrowed his eyes at this display. "Whatever. Just make sure you leave tomorrow."<p>"Why that little! I'll show her!" snarled Ranma as she started to get out of bed.<p>"Shut up and go to sleep. Do you want to end up married?" snapped Ryu.<p>Ranma paused and stared at him for a moment. "Not really, but I can't just let him get away with that!"<p>"He is correct. It is a matter of professional pride now," agreed Ryoga.<p>"Who asked you?" snapped Ryu.<p>"I'll show that brat! He won't get away with talking to me that way! We're going into the mountains tomorrow regardless. I will come back though, I'm not going to leave Ucchan to that punk!" Ranma clenched her fists and smiled.<p>+++++++++++++<p>In the hallway, Shampoo nodded to the young boy. "You did that on purpose didn't you?"<p>Konatsu gave her a blank stare and continued walking. "Lady Ukyo's happiness is all that matters to me. Regardless of whether or not it is with me. I owe her more than I can repay."<p>"I see." Shampoo gave him a small wink and went back into her room.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>"Well, good morning, Ranchan," said Ukyo with a small blush on her cheeks as she saw her beloved exit his room. She was wearing her armor once again. Konatsu stood beside her and gave him a distasteful frown.<p>"Hi," said the boy nervously. He had just changed back into a boy again and his hair was still wet. "We'll be leaving soon. It was nice seeing you again Ucchan."<p>"Yes it was," agreed Ukyo cheerfully.<p>Ryu emerged from the room looking incredibly tired. "Who the hell's idea was it to sleep with a dwarf in the room? I thought the whole room was shaking!"<p>"Ha ha! That's the snore of a real dwarf all right!" Ryoga strolled out of the room and beamed cheerfully.<p>Shampoo staggered out of her own room with a scowl on her face. "Great, a morning dwarf." She was dressed, but still looked half asleep.<p>"Well, lets get going," said Ukyo cheerfully.<p>"Let's?" Ranma looked at Ryu quizzically.<p>"Where are you going?" asked Kumon with his arms crossed.<p>"I'm taking you through that pass. I won't let my Ranchan do something so dangerous on his own. Konatsu will stay here and guard the town. When the reinforcements arrive, he'll clean up the mess."<p>"Uh, no," said Ryu dryly.<p>Ukyo held up her spear and smirked at him. "Care to try and stop me?"<p>"Through the pass and nothing more," said Ryu.<p>"You're going to Morid aren't you? Getting there will be easier with a Knight of Bahamut with you."<p>Ranma started to protest, but finally hung his shoulders. "She's right. I hate to say it, but the place will be crawling with soldiers. We aren't likely to get very far before someone stops us along the road. Plus we have to get across the mountains first."<p>"I know the way. There's a pass that merchants use. Otherwise you'll just have to climb over them. It's the only way through. That's where we'll run into the goblins."<p>"We do know where we're going, but it will be easier with a guide," admitted Shampoo.<p>Ranma looked at Ukyo again. "Don't you have a duty here?"<p>"No. I discovered the goblins while traveling. I sent a message with the help of a traveling witch. I wasn't ordered here, and used my own authority to stop travel until the goblins are dispersed."<p>"All right then. We'd better go." Ryu walked outside the hotel followed by his companions. Ranma quickly caught up with him as they walked through the streets towards the edge of town. "We'll be at that dwarf village in a few hours."<p>"I know. It isn't too far away. We both know our way to Morid, we've been there enough times."<p>"Let's hope 'Miss Holy Knight' here will let us go about our business once we reach the city," commented Ranma.<p>"We'll just act like we're moving on to Northern Joketsuko. It shouldn't be to hard to get her to stay in Morid until we return." Ryu looked back at their new companion and sighed. "We're going to have to behave ourselves for a while. You know I hate that."<p>"Great," muttered Ranma.<p>"Are you really planning on coming back to her again? It isn't like you to do something like that just to spite that little cross dresser." Ryu paused for a moment and blinked. "Never mind, it is just like you."<p>"Hey! What's that supposed to mean!" growled Ranma.<p>"Nothing, just forget about it," said Ryu calmly.<p>"Like hell! Tell me what you meant by that!" snapped Ranma.<p>A few feet behind them Ukyo turned to Shampoo. "Are they always like this?"<p>"Yes. They are very good friends," said Shampoo cheerfully. "Although, neither of the idiots will admit that."<p>"Oh my. This is going to be a long trip isn't it?" Ukyo hung her head.<p>"Please don't feel too badly, but they haven't even started yet. Ryoga hasn't said his piece yet."<p>"All three of them are this bad?"<p>"No. It's much worse normally."<p>+++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: Goblin Pass!<p>C&amp;C to<p>
