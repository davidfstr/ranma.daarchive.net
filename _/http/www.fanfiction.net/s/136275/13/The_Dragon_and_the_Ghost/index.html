</div>The Dragon and The Ghost<p>Part 13<p>Niku, and the Darkness Beyond.<p>+++++++++++<p>Using a very long length of rope, Ryu Kumon lowered himself down the dark hole, following behind his companions as they went down into the darkness below in search of Ranma and his prisoner. They had no idea what to expect really, the dark wizard who had once taken control of the forest was long gone, but magic could live on for quite a long time.<p>Once they reached the bottom, they found themselves standing in ankle deep water. Steam rose up all around them, giving the cave a hazy fog that prevented them from seeing very far, even with the magical light provided by Shampoo's elven magic.<p>"They aren't here," said Ukyo with a small growl.<p>"Maybe they just didn't want to stand in the water?" said Ryoga as he glanced up at them. Everyone looked back at him and he shrugged his shoulders. "Maybe not?"<p>"Come on," muttered Ryu with a small sigh as he started to walk to the edge of the spring. The walls of the cave rose high into the air above them. "This place is big."<p>"It is natural," commented Shampoo lazily. "I don't sense anything unnatural about this place. Don't take that to mean it is safe though."<p>"Right, there are a lot of things that live in places like this," commented Ukyo with a small chill. It was in a place like this that she had her final battle with the demon dragon Timaht. It was not a pleasant memory for her<p>"She's right, there's no dwarven settlements that go down this deep. We mine deep, but live relatively close the surface," commented Ryoga as he pulled his axe off of his back and glanced around nervously. "There are reasons for that."<p>"There was a battle here," commented Ukyo as she knelt down on the ground and peered at the ground. These cuts in the floor were made by bladed weapons of some kind." She indicated several tiny scratches in the floor, they were small, and spaced pretty far apart. There were also several scraps of metal lying around, scattered about the cavern floor.<p>"Look!" said Shampoo as she pointed at something lying on the ground. It was at the edge of a large canyon within the cave.<p>Ryu rushed over and picked up the remains of a rope lightly. "These are that knight's binds, she's loose."<p>"Great," muttered Ukyo angrily.<p>"He let her go, these were cut," replied Ryu.<p>"It could have been whatever made those marks on the ground," offered Shampoo lazily.<p>"I doubt that, Ranma probably let her loose when things got to hot. I would have done the same in his position," replied the boy with a shrug.<p>"Where are they though?" said Ryoga with an irritated snort. "There's nowhere to run, besides going down that is."<p>Ukyo gasped in horror. "No! You don't think they..." She peered down the edge of the cliff carefully.<p>"No, that's how they got across," said Ryu as he jerked his thumb over his shoulder as he looked down with her for a moment.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Great, I'm loose. Now what?" snapped Akane as she glared at the rapidly approaching monsters. The canyon was behind them, ruling out running away.<p>"We kill them, and then figure out how the hell we're going to get out of here," replied the pigtailed boy sharply as he charged forward, matching the speed of the approaching Niku.<p>"No! Wait!" cried the girl in alarm as she ran behind him.<p>Ranma dove headfirst into the battle, slashing at the closest monster and catching it across the chest easily. The thing cried out in alarm and was thrown back against a nearby pillar of stone, made from a stalactite that had met with a stalagmite over the centuries. There were quite a few scattered around the cavern.<p>He landed and spun around punching out with his feet and fist, catching two more of the beasts as they attempted to pass by him. The sailed away from him and he ducked under the spear of the remaining Niku.<p>"Damn! What the hell are these things made of?" he snarled as his foot and fist exploded in pain. He glanced at the one who had passed him and jumped forward towards Akane. "Look out!"<p>The knight jumped back as the thing embedded its spear into the ground where she had been standing, giggling madly. It opened its jaws and snapped at her as she backed away. "Damn!" It was about to lunge forward, when a shower of sparks flew from behind its head, sending it flying away from her and into the far wall.<p>"What?" she muttered as she picked up the discarded katana. She almost dropped it, the thing weighed a ton. It was easily four times heavier than her broadsword.<p>Ranma landed near her and scowled. "Are you hurt?"<p>"No," she muttered.<p>"Good, give me back my sword," he said while looking over his shoulder. There didn't appear to be any more of them.<p>Akane looked at the blade, and then back at him. "He swings this thing around one handed?" Reluctantly, she placed the hilt back into his hand. She glanced up at his face as she did so, noticing that he was watching her movements very carefully. A small frown crossed her face as she realized that she never would have been able to use the heavy weapon to attack him.<p>As if in response to her thoughts, he twirled the sword around in his hand effortlessly and placed it back in its scabbard on his back.<p>Akane growled at him and frowned. "Why are you putting that away? We have to get out of here, before they get their senses back!"<p>"Huh?" muttered the boy in surprise. His cocky grin fell away as he heard the distinctive sound of metal against metal again. "No way!"<p>"My sister made them herself. She's quite proud of them, but they're nothing more than metal golems really," said the girl through her teeth.<p>"More news tomboy, they aren't after me," said Ranma as he faced the cave again. He could see she wasn't lying, the things were slowly standing up from where they had landed. One of them was shaking its head in a daze, while the others had already gotten back to normal. They worked their jaws open and closed slowly as they regarded the pair from a good distance away.<p>"What do you mean?" snapped the knight angrily.<p>"You saw that last one. He went right past me and straight for you," said Ranma sharply. "We don't have anything that can kill a golem either," he snapped to himself.<p>"Then we're going to die," said Akane coldly. "I can think of a lot of ways I'd rather go."<p>"We ain't dead yet," said Ranma with a cocky grin.<p>"Here they come," said Akane as she braced herself again.<p>"Great," muttered Ranma as he looked around, hoping for some kind of escape. Then, he found it. "Hey, think you can keep them busy for a minute?"<p>"What? Why?" snapped the knight.<p>"Good," replied Ranma as he vanished from in front of her.<p>"Coward!" screamed the girl in rage. She turned to face the things as they converged on her, not seeming to care about him leaving. "So, it's true," she thought as she rushed forward screaming angrily.<p>Akane tore through them as best she could. She punched and kicked at them relentlessly as they bounced around her, dodging their swipes and slashes as best she could. Each blow she landed caused her limbs to explode in pain, merely pushing the things back for a moment. They jumped back onto their feet immediately and returned, seeming to not even notice her attacks. "Just one, please. If only just one," she muttered as the things converged on her again.<p>"Thor's Hammer!" screamed the girl as she lashed out with her final attack. A war hammer made out of pure energy appeared in her right hand as she slashed down. The weapon connected with one of the beasts and it screamed in pain, shaking violently on the end of her attack. After a moment, it exploded, sending shards of metal in every direction. Akane felt one of them dig deeply into her left arm and screamed in pain. She fell to her knees, completely spent and simply waited. The other three Niku formed a cautious circle around her and simply stared.<p>After about ten seconds, they realized that she no longer had the strength to fight on. Their jaws worked in anticipation. They leapt into the air and attempted to pile on top of her.<p>"Look out!" cried Ranma as he appeared beside her suddenly and pulled her away, rolling along the ground with her.<p>The Niku landed in a dog pile and scattered like roaches in every direction as a heavy groaning echoed through the cavern.<p>Ranma jumped to his feet and then pulled Akane into his arms. "I thought you said you could hold them!" he joked as he landed on top of a falling pillar of stone from just beside the canyon.<p>"Where the hell were you?" snapped the girl angrily, that was when she realized what was happening.<p>"Making a bridge!" said the pigtailed boy as he suddenly pushed himself harder as the pillar began to near the ground on the other side. One of the Niku bounced just behind them, rushing after them across the surface of the rock.<p>Then Ranma jumped into the air off the makeshift bridge and rolled along the ground for a moment. He stopped and turned on the opposite side of the canyon and watched as the stone pillar slammed into the ground. It immediately shattered on impact, with the Niku still standing on top of it. The thing let out a shrill cry as it plummeted into the darkness below.<p>"That's two," muttered Akane weakly.<p>"You're hurt," said Ranma as he placed her on the ground and stepped back.<p>"No thanks to you," she snorted.<p>"Hey! You said you could take them!" he replied sharply.<p>"I said nothing of the kind!" snarled the girl. She promptly fell back onto the ground. "Why didn't you just leave me? You could have escaped."<p>"Hey. You're my prisoner, remember? Besides, I never leave anyone behind," replied the boy with his smug grin returning once again.<p>"Honor among thieves?" said Akane sarcastically.<p>"You're no thief," said the boy as he glanced back across the canyon.<p>"You've got that right! Honorless dog!" snarled the knight. She slowly rose to her feet and glared at him.<p>"Whatever, you're in no condition to fight right now," chuckled the boy as he brushed off her sudden assertiveness.<p>"I'll see you rotting in a cell yet," she replied darkly.<p>"Aw man! I thought we'd be safe over here," said Ranma as his attention was suddenly elsewhere.<p>"What?" said the knight as she tried to look where his gaze was. All she could see was darkness. Suddenly, she could see the remaining two Niku. They were clinging to the ceiling of the cavern, and moving directly towards them. "Damn!"<p>"Come on!" snapped Ranma as he pulled on her arm and dragged her further into the darkness.<p>++++++++++<p>"We can't get across," grumbled Ryoga angrily. He simply glared forward and kicked a stone into the pit. It bounced off the walls for a bit before simply plummeting away into the shadows.<p>"There is a way," said Shampoo.<p>"No, he's right. We're wasting time here. It's best if we just go back up and keep moving," said Ryu.<p>"What? Are you out of your mind?" snapped Ukyo.<p>"Ranma can take care of himself! This isn't the first time something like this has happened to us. He'll catch up," said Ryu firmly.<p>"I won't leave him!" snarled the knight angrily.<p>"He does know Ranma better than either of us," said Shampoo with a small shrug. "Although, I'll admit, this rubs me the wrong way as well. After all, it is a lot of money we're offering for his services."<p>"Hey! I never even wanted this job, damn it! He's the one dumb enough to take it! He'll show up, it'll take more than a cave to stop him," insisted the boy angrily.<p>Ryoga frowned. "If he doesn't, I still get paid, right?"<p>"I shall see that you are rewarded for your trouble," muttered Shampoo in disgust.<p>"Right. I'm with him then. I've hunted Ranma for a long time; he'll get out of this. I've chased him across places much more dangerous than this."<p>"Oh? Like what?" snapped Ukyo.<p>"Timaht's Cavern, while the beast was still livin by the way, Roshaikes Marsh, The Dead Plains, The Black Forests of Hurant, The Black Temple of Azule, Castle Anthrax, umm, let's see now..."<p>"I get the point!" snapped Ukyo as she belted the dwarf over his head with the handle of her spear.<p>The dwarf rubbed his head in irritation and glared at her. "Ouch," he muttered under his breath.<p>"You're sure he'll be all right?" muttered Ukyo with an uncertain glance into the darkness.<p>"Trust me," said Ryu calmly.<p>"I hate this," she muttered under her breath. "I won't go."<p>"Stay then. I've got a job to do, Ranma will be pissed if I screw it up," said Ryu as he started to walk back towards the spring.<p>"Ukyo, he's right. We must get this staff out of the country. We can't allow it to fall into the Emperor's hands," said Shampoo gently. "The sooner we escape, the better. We can't allow them to prepare for us. We've already wasted too much time in this forest."<p>"But...Ranma's alone, with that woman," said Ukyo with a sullen frown.<p>Shampoo found herself glancing into the darkness suddenly herself. A small growl formed in her throat. "Indeed, perhaps it is better if we did go after him?"<p>"Quit flappin yer jaws! Let's go! If Ranma wants to have a little fun, let em! She's his prisoner after all," snapped Ryoga as he glared at them.<p>"No! I won't allow it!" cried Ukyo in rage.<p>"Indeed, we don't have time for such things," agreed Shampoo.<p>Ryu appeared again and stood between them. "That idiot wouldn't know what to do with a naked woman. Don't worry about that, they don't even like each other remember?"<p>"I suppose, but things can happen if a man and a woman are alone in the darkness!" cried Ukyo.<p>"Hmm, you're right," said Ryu as he took her arm and started to lead her away.<p>"Hey! How come I get stuck with the elf?" snapped Ryoga.<p>Shampoo and Ukyo looked at each other and promptly decked both of the men.<p>"Honestly. I know my Ranchan would never act that way! What was I thinking?" said Ukyo curtly.<p>"Indeed, he seemed most honorable," agreed Shampoo. "Even if he is a thief."<p>They looked at one another again.<p>++++++++<p>A half hour later, Ryu and Ryoga bodily pulled Shampoo and Ukyo out from the hole and threw them on the ground just outside.<p>"If he is having such a fun night, and I'll kill him if he is, then there's nothing you can do about it now!" snapped Ryu. Both girls looked at him angrily and then reluctantly nodded.<p>"Come on! Let's just get the hell out of here!" snapped Ryoga as he started walking, in the direction of Joketsuko.<p>"This way!" snapped Ryu as he pulled the dwarf in the right direction. He paused and noticed both women sneaking back towards the entrance to the cave once again. "Damn it! I need that elf girl to get paid, and Ranma will kill me if I let anything happen to his stupid girlfriend!"<p>Eventually, Ryu found himself dragging the two angry women behind him by the back of their collars, Ryoga walked a short distance away, out of arms reach of either of the girls, just behind.<p>After a short time, the women calmed down a bit. Ukyo and Shampoo were glaring at each other angrily.<p>"So, the truth comes out! You were after my Ranchan weren't you?" snapped the knight.<p>"What if I was?" retorted the elf.<p>"He's mine! Hands off!" said Ukyo bitterly.<p>"Funny, I didn't see a ring on his finger," commented Shampoo.<p>"There might as well be!" retorted Ukyo.<p>"Ranma is mine!"<p>"You're nothing but an annoyance! You should know how elves deal with obstacles like you!"<p>Ryu rubbed at his temples. "To hell with Ranma and the damn money! I say we just kill them both!"<p>Ryoga crossed his arms over his chest and frowned deeply. "Perhaps we should have left them in the cave after all?"<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Are they still following us?" said Ranma as he and Akane entered a narrow tunnel somewhere in the cavern depths.<p>"Of course they are, but I don't see them," said the knight as she glanced around nervously.<p>"We'll stop and rest here then," said Ranma coolly as he opened a secret door inside the wall.<p>"How did you...?" gasped Akane.<p>"This is that old wizard's workshop. The cottage I found the dryad at was just his house. There should be an exit near here," said Ranma with a small shrug.<p>"You've been here before?" said the knight in surprise.<p>"No, but I do this for a living, remember?" Ranma walked inside the small room and lit a torch with a small wave of his hand.<p>Akane peered around in awe. There were hundreds of books and potions lining the wall on old looking shelves, a large wooden table with arcane symbols on it sat in the center of the room, and also several wooden stools around it. The room had obviously not been used for some time, a thick coat of dust covered everything.<p>"Don't touch anything. This place is covered in traps," said Ranma casually as he began to inspect his surroundings. "Not much of use to us in here."<p>Akane leaned against the wall and sat down on one of the stools that wasn't at the table. Her eyes fell on an unusual painting on the stones of the wall behind her. "What is that?"<p>She was looking at a picture of a cup of some kind. It was golden and had several jewels embedded on it around its center. Some sort of light appeared to be coming out of the top, and was pouring on a figure lying on the ground for some reason.<p>"Huh? Oh, it's just the Grail of Bahamut," said Ranma he glanced over his shoulder. He was busy looking at a row of books on the opposite side of the room.<p>"Are you sure?" muttered Akane. It was an old legend, and no known pictures of the grail were left, it's existence was not much more than a tale for bards as far as most were concerned.<p>"Pretty sure," said Ranma without looking back at her as he lifted one of the tomes into his hand. "Useless." He turned and smiled as he finally found what he was looking for. He pulled a dusty looking box out from under one of the shelves and laid it on top of the table.<p>"What is that?" said Akane. "Something to kill those two monsters?"<p>"No, I checked around, but no books on golems. Sorry. This is just some bandages and healing herbs for your arm," said the boy cheerfully.<p>"Oh," Akane looked at him in surprise for a moment and hung her head. "I suppose it would be dumb to refuse, even though I hate your guts. We may run into them again."<p>"Think you can do that hammer thing again?" said the boy as he sat down across from her and pulled her arm towards him gently.<p>Akane winced in pain and grit her teeth, she had pulled out the large metal piece long ago, but the wound was rather large and ugly looking. A new surge of blood started to flow as he forced her to move it again. "No. It is difficult to do, I wouldn't be able to do it unless I was at full strength. Once a day is about all I can do."<p>Ranma nodded as if he wasn't really paying attention. "Hmm, you should have left the metal in there. It might have cut an artery or something. You'd have bled to death if it had, long before we reached here."<p>"What do you care?" she snapped bitterly.<p>"I need you alive," he said with a shrug. "Remember?"<p>"Oh yes, the mythical 'golden mask'?" she said lazily as he worked. She sucked in a quick breath as he applied the herbs to her arm, the pain lasted only a moment though. He began to wrap the bandage around the wound and merely nodded. "I've never seen armor like that."<p>"I'm starting to believe you. I don't think anyone has in about ten years. It was the same as yours though, that's something."<p>"Ten years?" said Akane with a slight look of surprise on her face. "What did this armor do to you anyway?"<p>"The man wearing it, hunted down and murdered my father," said Ranma quietly.<p>"Really? Was he as much of a jerk as you are?" snorted the girl coldly.<p>"No, he was an honorable man. The man who killed him was an old friend of his; I heard some of what they said after they found him. They were sent there to kill the both of us, but something happened and they couldn't find me."<p>"So, you ran away and hid like a coward while they killed him?" snapped Akane darkly.<p>"I was a child, and injured. I would have fought with him until my dying breath if I could have, but I was knocked out. I woke up a few times, but I never stayed awake long enough to help," said Ranma with surprising calm. "I want to find that man, and show him what I think of a knight who would hunt down an unarmed man and his child."<p>"I... see," said Akane with a sudden surge of guilt, it didn't last long though. "Is this why you are a thief? So you can avenge your father?"<p>"Actually yes, it's the best profession to be in if you want to find somebody. I've grown strong over time, and learned to be the best. When I find that man, I'll face him like a man."<p>"Are you sure? You could face him like an elf. It would suit you better," snapped the girl as she took her arm away from him finally.<p>"You know, you've sure got a bad attitude you tomboy."<p>"I suppose I should thank you for keeping me alive for your own purposes?" snapped the knight.<p>"No, but you've got a really nasty disposition. Even before I kidnapped you, it's been bugging me ever since I met you. I wonder what would turn someone who could be a relatively cute girl, into an uncute brute like you?"<p>"When we get out of this mess, I'll show you how much of a brute I can be," said Akane coldly.<p>"Ha! A slow chick like you doesn't stand a chance against me!" replied the pigtailed boy smugly.<p>Akane growled; her hand closed around something next to the stool and she picked it up and slammed it down on the thief's head.<p>Ranma was thrown to the floor roughly and looked up at the wooden mallet that was now embedded in his skull. "That hurt you know."<p>"Good. Maybe you'll learn to curb your tongue!" snapped Akane bitterly as she leaned back against the wall and closed her eyes. Her brow furrowed as she attempted to rest. "I'll actually be glad to get back to that idiot, Kuno, after this jerk."<p>+++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo frowned as someone entered her sanctuary rather tastelessly. There was only one man bold enough, and stupid enough, to do such a thing. "Don't you know how to knock, Kuno?"<p>"You shall address me as 'Lord Kuno'!" roared the man angrily.<p>"What do you want, Kuno?" she said ignoring his protest.<p>"I have need of your services lowly witch!" snarled the man arrogantly.<p>"That will cost you," said Nabiki coldly.<p>"I have the usual payment on hand," said the man as several servants tossed three bags of gold at her feet and left as quickly as they had entered.<p>"Tell me what you need," she said with a sigh.<p>"I wish to know the whereabouts of the lovely, Lady Akane! The Emperor has returned, but I have not seen her within the palace!"<p>Nabiki smiled evilly. It was far too perfect, too easy to be rid of him for good. She had lost two of her Niku men so far, and had doubts that the others would survive. Her sister would have to pay for destroying her favorite toys, she had tried her best to give her a quick and painless end, but how had the girl repaid her? Well, Akane always was a bit of a brute anyway. She slowly turned and gazed directly at the young lord coolly. "You have not heard the news? My sister was abducted, taken with the Kajakan by those that raided the castle in Joketsuko."<p>"She has been...?" muttered the boy in shocked horror.<p>"No doubt, they are ravaging her purity as we speak. I have not been able to free her, despite my powerful magic! I was just about to send for you!"<p>"Witch! Why did you not do so sooner?" he snapped angrily. "I shall save Lady Akane this very day! We shall be wed before we return, so that none but I shall know of her shame. A noble and honorable sacrifice upon myself for her sake indeed!"<p>Nabiki snorted. If the idiot managed to save her in some sort of miracle, everyone in the palace would know of her supposed shame. The moron would boast about disguising it so honorably for years. "Indeed, I have faith in your prowess. Go now, to the forest to the south of Joketsuko. Akane shall appear there with her captors in three days." There, that would ensure that Akane suffered a bit before her eventual demise. She didn't want it to be too bad for her. After all, she was her sister.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"Lord Herb, what are your orders?" said Mint as he bowed before his master placidly.<p>"I want you two to find the Kajakan for me, and bring it back. If you cannot, return here and tell me what you have learned," said the man as he sat on his personal throne and scowled at them. His face was covered in small cuts and bruises, Kiima had been less than merciful in front of her master.<p>"Yes, my lord!" said Lime firmly.<p>"Listen carefully fools. If you retrieve the Kajakan, bring it to me directly. No one else, not even Nabiki, or even the Emperor himself must obtain it before me."<p>"Lord Herb?" said Mint with a hint of worry in his voice.<p>"Do not concern yourself. I shall return it to the Emperor." He had a dark look in his eyes as he said this, and almost spat the words at them.<p>"Yes, of course. We understand," said Lime. He paused and looked up at his master for a moment. "Master? Please forgive me."<p>"What is it?" said the man calmly.<p>"What of Lady Akane?"<p>Herb looked at them for a moment and frowned. "Do not attempt to rescue her, unless a clear opportunity presents itself. I want the Kajakan first and foremost. Remember, if you fail, report to me immediately," he said with a heavy sigh. "That should keep the idiots happy," he thought to himself. He knew from Nabiki's magic that the girl was as good as dead.<p>"Yes, Lord Herb," replied the pair in unison.<p>"Go, carry out my orders," said the man as he stood up and turned away from them. When he turned back, they were gone.<p>++++++++++<p>"I don't like it Mint, it's almost like he wants us to fail," said Lime as he walked with his companion.<p>"I agree, but I don't think we'll be punished if we can't get it," agreed Mint with a small sigh. "I sure hope we can save Lady Akane though. I like her."<p>"Yeah, we won't get to visit Mistress Kasumi as much either," said Lime with a worried look on his face.<p>"Hey!" said Mint with a sudden start.<p>"What is it?" asked Lime as he glanced around nervously.<p>"If we save her... do you think she'll let us see her titties?"<p>"Hey! Great idea! We'll ask her after we save her!" said Mint happily.<p>"You two! Why are you still alive? Did you not die for your mistress?" roared an angry sounding voice from behind them.<p>"Huh?" said the pair as they turned to see Kuno pointing his sword at them.<p>"How dare you defile these halls with your presence after you failed to protect Lady Akane!"<p>"But, we're not Lady Akane's servants," said Mint.<p>"Yeah, we work for Lord Herb," agreed Lime.<p>"Silence! I shall have none of your excuses cowards! This very day, I ride out to free your mistress from the bonds of her evil captors!" exclaimed Kuno as he waved his sword in the air dramatically.<p>Lime and Mint had to back away to avoid being cut. They simply stared at the scene and blinked.<p>"Great!"<p>"Yeah, see ya!"<p>"Halt fiends! I shall allow you to accompany me, in order to redeem yourselves from your cowardly ways! I have not forgotten your many long years of loyal service to Lady Akane! Let it not be said that I am not merciful!"<p>"Service to Lord Herb," corrected Mint halfheartedly.<p>"Oh, come on, we might as well go with him," grumbled Lime with a disappointed look on his face.<p>"I guess," said Mint with a similar expression.<p>With that, the trio of fools wandered towards the palace stables.<p>++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: The brave deeds of Lord Kuno!<p>Sorry, I couldn't resist putting these idiots together.<p>
