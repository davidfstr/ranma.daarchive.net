</div>The Dragon and The Ghost.<p>Part 11<p>Ryu's brave deed.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma smiled as Ryu glared at her. They were standing in a field just outside Joketsuko, away from the trade roads that entered the city. It was late night, and the twin moons hung overhead giving the reunited party its only light.<p>"Have you lost your mind?" snapped Ryu as he stomped his feet angrily. He glared at the black night for a moment and spun on his heels away from the still smirking redhead.<p>Akane was tied up with her hands behind her back, the last remnants of her armor were still inside the drainage tunnel the two elf girls had used to enter and exit the castle; leaving her clothed in a black silk dogi, and a pair of leather boots.<p>Ukyo stood nearby watching the scene in disgust. She was now dressed in her armor again, and was applying healing herbs to her hands. Ryoga was next to her doing the same thing. "This was a really stupid move Ranchan."<p>"I don't think so, she could be quite valuable to us later on. We may need a bargaining chip along the way," commented Shampoo.<p>"Herb won't bargain for my life. He doesn't like me. The Emperor won't lose any sleep if I die in service to him either," said the black knight coldly.<p>"You aren't helping your case any," commented Ranma dryly. "I need information from you. You aren't going anywhere until I get it."<p>"I told you. I've never seen armor like you've described," replied the woman curtly.<p>"I don't believe you," snorted the redhead. "Besides, at least I know who my little guest is."<p>The dark haired girl had awoken a short time earlier. She was in the same situation as Akane, but appeared to be taking it in stride. She merely sat quietly and listened to the conversation.<p>"We know she was a prisoner," said Ryu calmly. "That means she's got no love for the Emperor at least."<p>"I wouldn't count on that," said Ranma as she glanced at her carefully.<p>"That's why she's tied up," retorted Ryu. "Your little package is a time bomb! She could alert any soldiers passing by. Or even escape and try to kill us."<p>"She's unarmed. Plus, she's been hacking at those ropes, with that rock she picked up, for an hour. You'd think she would have realized they were enchanted by now," said Ranma as she leveled her gaze on her prisoner.<p>Akane glared at him angrily for a moment, before she dropped the rock on the ground and tugged at her binds. They weren't weakened in the slightest and she knew it. "Damn."<p>"I say we kill her," said Ryu firmly.<p>"No. We may get some useful information out of her. Even if she doesn't know of this armor," said the black haired girl as she glared at the black knight in anger.<p>"I was wondering when you'd speak up. I'm sorry, but we're going to have to keep you tied up until we find out who you really are lady. I don't trust you, the fact that you want to keep her alive isn't helping you either," said Ryu as he turned to face her.<p>"I can accept that," she said firmly.<p>"I don't recognize her," said Ukyo as she walked around the girl. "I don't spend much time inside the castle though."<p>"Well, I doubt she's a servant the way they had her locked up," said Ryu with a small nod.<p>"She don't look like a witch either," said Ryoga as he eyed the girl as well.<p>"I have no need of sorcery," replied the girl curtly.<p>"Who are ye anyway?" said the dwarf as he walked up to her.<p>"I am a member of the royal court," said the woman in reply. She was being very diplomatic about the situation she was in.<p>"She acts like it. She's scared out of her mind right now, but she's calm. A diplomat maybe? Why lock her up though," said Ranma.<p>"Lady Ukyo. Was it you who rescued me?" said the girl as she turned towards the knight. She seemed comforted by her presence.<p>"No. He did," said the knight as she nodded towards Ryu.<p>"I must thank you then." The girl bowed her head slightly to him.<p>"I just needed a shield. That damn sorcerer was blasting at me from behind," muttered the boy in embarrassment.<p>Ryoga noted the tattered and burnt clothing she was wearing and nodded, it seemed like something he'd do. Fortunately, neither Ukyo nor the girl had overheard him.<p>"High ranking noble at that," commented Ranma. "She's too refined to just be a diplomat. She's acting like a high lady of the court or something."<p>"What would you know?" snarled Akane. "Spent a lot of time around royals have you?"<p>"That's my business lady. I'm starting to think killing you might not be a bad idea," replied the elf girl lazily.<p>"Do you have any idea about the situation you've put yourself in?" snarled the black knight. "You have kidnapped the leader of the Emperor's black knights. You'll be hunted down..."<p>"Like dogs, to the Ends of the Earth!" finished Ranma mockingly. "Yada, yada, yada, heard it all before. We're already hunted by every military power and government on the continent. This isn't a problem for us. Besides, I think they'll be more interested in finding this." She held the staff up to the girl's face and smirked.<p>"The Kajakan?" said the girl. "What would you want with that? It's useless without the Emperor's power behind it!"<p>"We don't want it," said Ryu with a shrug. "Someone hired us to find it."<p>"Who?" snapped the black knight.<p>"That would be telling, wouldn't it Ryu?" said Ranma as she glanced back at her partner.<p>"Yup. Breach of contract and all that. People who hire thieves don't want others to know who they are. That is why they hire us after all," confirmed the boy with a nod.<p>"Fine. Who are you anyway?" asked Akane as she looked away from them.<p>"Now that... is a secret," said the red-haired girl with a smirk on her face as she winked at her and wagged her finger in the air.<p>"Gods, not that guy again," muttered Ryu as he buried his face in his hands. "I'll be glad if we never meet that jerk again as long as we live."<p>"He has uses," said Ranma lazily. "The question now is simple. Now what?"<p>"We take the Kajakan to safety, and get you paid," said Shampoo with a small shrug.<p>"What about you Ukyo?" said Ranma as he glanced at her.<p>"I'm going with you. We should stop by and meet the other knights tomorrow though."<p>"You would leave at a time like this?" said the dark haired girl in shock.<p>"Can't think of a better time. The country is gone, the knights are all dead, and I can do more good making sure this things stays out of the Emperor's hands. Konatsu, Hiroshi, and Daisuke, can stay here and try to build up a little resistance for a while if they want."<p>"But... your knightly duties?" stammered the girl in shock.<p>"Extend beyond protecting my home now. This is too important, and even I can't fight off an army like this. We'd do better ensuring that the Emperor is weakened, and wait for a better time to strike."<p>"You... are right," said the girl with her head hanging slightly.<p>"I imagine they killed the queen," said Ryu as he looked back towards Joketsuko. "It'll be a long hard road if you want to resist."<p>"She, is not dead," said the dark haired girl.<p>"What?" said Ukyo with her eyes growing wide. "If that's true... I really can't leave. I've got to go back!"<p>"And get yourself killed?" said Ryoga as he squatted down and began tightening the leather straps on the handle of his axe.<p>"If there is any chance I can save my queen..." said the girl with a slightly saddened glance back at Ranma.<p>"I understand Ucchan," said the elf girl as she forced herself to look away.<p>"There is no need," said the dark haired girl with a heavy sigh. "You have already saved her." She didn't want to tell them, but having Ukyo going back to the palace was something she couldn't allow. "You're looking at her right now."<p>Everyone turned to face her, and simply stared.<p>"Pardon?" said Ryoga after a long silence.<p>"I am Queen Rouge," said the girl as she stood to her feet.<p>"You don't look anything like her! She's got eight arms!" said Ukyo angrily.<p>"Sometimes I do, Lady Knight," replied the woman proudly as she stared her down.<p>"Oh, I get it. Some kind of transformation magic right?" said Ranma with a smirk. "A nasty illusion to keep the yokels in check?"<p>"Something like that," agreed Rouge calmly. "Having eight arms puts a real strain on your back too. Once, my court masseuse had to return home for a funeral. I was in a bad mood for a month."<p>Ukyo blinked. "I...remember that."<p>"Do you now?" said Rouge coyly.<p>"Well..." muttered the knight in embarrassment.<p>"We'd better get moving. I'd like to make it to a safe place before sunrise," commented Ryu.<p>"Right, it isn't going to take long for them to realize that we aren't in the city," agreed Ukyo.<p>"Aren't you going to cut me loose?" said Rouge in irritation.<p>"Only after your story checks out, your majesty," said Ryu as he started walking away.<p>Ukyo looked at her apologetically. "If your story is true, please forgive me." She bowed slightly and started to walk next to her.<p>"All right, oh mighty dark one. Move it," said Ranma as she forced Akane to her feet and kicked her rear.<p>"You'll suffer for this humiliation," snapped Akane.<p>"Bark more puppy. We may just have to put you down for being too loud," said the cheerful elf girl as she forced her forward.<p>++++++++++<p>"The Kajakan has been stolen?" said Saffron as he sat on the throne in Joketsuko castle. He did not seem particularly worried.<p>"Akane is gone as well. Perhaps she is a traitor?" said Herb calmly as he kneeled before him.<p>Kiima was standing beside the boy watching the scene unfold quietly.<p>"I doubt that. She's much too rigid and loyal. She has most likely been kidnapped," commented the boy lazily.<p>"As you say, she has still failed in her duty," pressed Herb calmly.<p>"If she returns without the staff, I shall put her to death," said the boy.<p>"As you say," muttered Herb placidly. He stood and started towards the door. "It's a good thing I don't plan on allowing you to get your hands on it again," he muttered quietly as he approached the doors.<p>"Herb. One more thing," said the boy with a small smirk appearing on his face.<p>"Yes my Emperor?" He fell to his knees again and faced the boy.<p>"Your failure did not go unnoticed either. Rouge is loose again, that makes my position here dangerous." He turned his head slightly and looked at the woman at his side. "Kiima, show him how we reward such failures. Keep him alive though, he still has to retrieve my staff."<p>The woman's face grew into a sly looking smile. "Yes, of course."<p>Herb stared at the ground as she approached. He did not move from his knees, he merely growled quietly under his breath.<p>Kiima stood over him and spread her wings wide. She held her hand in front of her and a small orb of energy floated just above her palm.<p>++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo watched in the mirror as Herb was punished. She shook her head and smiled darkly. "Oh my, you really should have done better darling." The man was quite strong, and did not utter even a whimper as Kiima took out payment on him mercilessly. She watched intently, fingering one of the candles that lit the room on each side of the floating mirror.<p>The wax trickled onto her finger, burning the delicate skin ever so slightly as her eyes grew wide at the images playing out before her. A slow blush crept onto her face and she gasped in pleasure at his suffering. Her breath became short quick gasps as she wrapped her hand around the length of the wax and moved it up and down rhythmically, allowing the hot dripping liquid to fall onto her hands.<p>"Herb darling, you really know how to show a girl a good time," said the sorceress with an evil chuckle that slowly grew into laughter.<p>+++++++++<p>Hiroshi and Daisuke stood beside Konatsu just outside of a small cottage in a tiny village a few miles outside of Joketsuko.<p>"Hey! You came back!" said Hiroshi cheerfully as he rushed up to Ukyo.<p>"The situation is dim," said Ukyo as she grabbed his arm in greeting.<p>"Who are these people?" said Daisuke as he approached the pair and clutched her arm as well.<p>"Thieves," replied Konatsu coldly as he walked up between the two men.<p>"Friends," corrected Ukyo as she gave him a small, disapproving glance. "This woman claims to be the queen."<p>"Doesn't look like her," commented Daisuke.<p>Rouge glanced around at the surroundings and smiled wistfully. Finally, she saw a small trough of water for horses, just outside the home. "At last!" She started towards it, but was stopped cold by Ranma's arm.<p>"Oh, I get it now," said the elf girl calmly. "If you're thirsty, there's water inside." She gave the woman a small wink and pulled at her ropes leading her away.<p>Akane growled darkly, and was shoved forward by Ryoga. The dwarf had taken the duty of guarding her when it neared morning.<p>+++++++++++<p>The sun was slowly rising into the sky when they all sat around the table inside the small home. It was little more than a single room, with a bed in the corner and a stove on the opposite side. Despite that, it was rather cozy.<p>Rouge stared at Ranma in confusion as he began to untie the knots that bound her. "Well your highness, you should have said something sooner."<p>"What do you mean?" said Rouge in shock.<p>Ryu was watching the scene in absolute disbelief. Ukyo was about to say something and Ryoga was completely disinterested in the matter. Focusing instead on cooking a small pot of stew for them.<p>Shampoo glanced at Ranma with a small smirk on her face as she seemed to understand as well.<p>The pigtailed elf placed a cup of water on the table in front of Rouge and smiled warmly. "Here you go."<p>Rouge immediately took it in her hands and dumped it over her head. She was transformed in an instant into the eight-armed goddess once again. "It is a relief. You knew of this?" the calm looking of the three heads turned towards Ranma and looked him up and down.<p>"Just figured it out," replied the elf cheerfully.<p>The knights were on their knees in an instant before their queen. Akane's jaw dropped, along with Ryu's.<p>"Jusenkyo," commented Ranma as she sat across from the woman and crossed her arms lazily.<p>"Get down! That's the queen!" snapped Konatsu bitterly.<p>"Shut yer trap runt," snorted Ranma in reply.<p>"Insolence!" snarled the feminine squire as he jumped to his feet and began to unsheathe his blade. He was quickly quieted as Ryu stood with his sword across the boy's neck before he could finish drawing.<p>"We have more important things to discuss," said Ranma coolly. "Like what you're going to do now."<p>"I will take the Kajakan, and use its power to take back my home," said the goddess calmly.<p>"No," replied Ranma with a shrug.<p>"No?" said the queen with her eyebrow raising slightly.<p>"I've been hired to deliver it, and I'm going to. Besides, what makes you think it would do any good? He wasn't killed when he used it was he?" said the redhead curtly.<p>"This is not a request," said the goddess with her entire head spinning to that of an angry scowl.<p>"And I'm not your subject," retorted Ranma coolly.<p>"No, but these knights are," said the goddess coldly.<p>"Do you really think they can beat us?" said Ryu as he tapped Konatsu on his shoulder with the blade. Hiroshi and Daisuke both jumped up and pointed their swords at him.<p>"Please remember, I know your weakness," said Ranma as she turned her eyes towards the teakettle that was brewing on the stove.<p>"Ranma," warned Ukyo as she hefted her spear upright.<p>"Ukyo, I'm not flexible on this. I've never failed a job, and I'm not going to start now. What happens to the Kajakan after it's delivered isn't my concern, but until it is..." Ranma leveled a cold glare at her.<p>"And I don't get paid until he does," said Ryoga. He had not moved away from the pot of stew yet.<p>"Very well, I shall do without it," said Rouge as her face turned again, back to the calm visage.<p>"Good! I'm glad we've reached an agreement," said Ranma cheerfully. "It's good to see you again by the way."<p>"Yes, I had not expected it to be like this though," confirmed the queen lazily.<p>The four knights almost dropped their weapons in shock.<p>"How did that work out by the way?" asked Ryu as he put his sword away casually.<p>"I am still queen," replied the woman calmly.<p>"That's contestable at the moment, but we've got other things to worry about," commented Ranma as she glanced back at Akane.<p>"Indeed. Will she be accompanying you?" said Rouge as she eyed the black knight as well. Akane appeared to be sleeping against the wall.<p>"She'll be a liability here. You'll have to kill her and stash the body, or risk holding her prisoner. Once we escape from imperial territory, we'll be safe enough with her in our hands," commented Ranma lazily.<p>"Quite so. I ask that you remove her then," said the queen.<p>"Who is that anyway?" said Hiroshi.<p>"Yeah, she's kind of cute," commented Daisuke.<p>"Only until she wakes up, believe me," said Ranma with a sigh. "I'll admit she ain't bad for an uncute tomboy though."<p>Both knights looked at her and blushed heavily. Then towards Ukyo, the two had been awfully friendly since they arrived.<p>"You don't think?" whispered Daisuke.<p>"I guess it makes sense," said Hiroshi with a small nod.<p>"There goes our chances," muttered Daisuke sadly.<p>"Damn," agreed Hiroshi. A small trickle of blood started to drip out of both boy's noses.<p>"You two don't need to know who she is," said Ukyo firmly as she noticed them still looking towards Akane.<p>"Yes, Ma'am," muttered the knights as they attempted to hide their noses from her.<p>"Ukyo will accompany you to your destination. As she said, there is not much we can do here at the moment. After the Emperor leaves the palace, I can take it back myself," said Rouge.<p>"Your majesty?" muttered the four knights in confusion.<p>"I am a goddess after all. Saffron is strong, as are his minions; but once they leave the palace to the guards and return home, I shall retake my castle. They will not attack again once I have done that."<p>"She's right. Once the palace falls into your hands again, I doubt Saffron will attempt to take it again for some time. He can't trick you like he did this time," agreed Ryu.<p>"It won't be easy raising an army here," commented Ranma.<p>"My people have prospered under my rule, they are loyal if nothing else. It will not be difficult," said the goddess proudly.<p>"I meant that it won't be easy to do without the imperials noticing," said the redhead.<p>"She's right, you have a long hard road ahead of you. Not that I don't like Ukyo, but it will be easier to rally them with a hero like her around," said Shampoo.<p>"I agree," said Konatsu.<p>"She will go with them. As the elf said, the Kajakan's fate beyond its delivery is not his concern," said the Queen as she leveled her gaze on Ukyo. "I am not foolish enough to try and stop her mission. I know what she is capable of if she so wishes. After all, I have used her in the same capacity at times."<p>The knight nodded her head in understanding as the silent order was given.<p>Shampoo frowned, there was nothing she could do at the moment though. Ukyo would have to be dealt with later.<p>++++++++<p>That night, while the others slept. Akane Tendo watched them from her place in the corner. She was still bound and had no hope of breaking the ropes, the enchantment was very powerful. Even if she could, they had hidden the Kajakan away, and she knew what would happen if she left without it.<p>"Damn her! That elf..." she glared hatefully at Ranma's sleeping form. Her eyes seemed to bore into the back of the girl's skull.<p>That is, until Ranma faded away into nothing, right in front of her. "What the?"<p>A voice from the shadows spoke sleepily to her. "Quit glaring will ya? It makes me uncomfortable when people watch me that way."<p>Akane simply stared forward in terror as she at last understood her situation. "Dragon Ghost! The most powerful thief alive!" She hung her head as it began to sink in. "She had just been stolen by her, and no one even knew what she really looked like. Nothing stolen by the legendary thief had ever been recovered, unless she was hired to steal it back herself.<p>"Father. I will return, I swear it!" she thought angrily. After all, legends came to an end eventually.<p>+++++++++++<p>Nabiki Tendo frowned as she stared into the mirror once again. "Akane, where are you?" The girl was being hidden away from her somehow. The magic in her armor was useless, because the girl had taken it off, or had it removed by her kidnappers.<p>She frowned and waved her hands in front of the mirror. She knew her sister was doomed. The Kajakan had been taken away, it was destiny in motion. She knew the black knight would not be able to recover it. When she returned, she would be put to death.<p>"Damn, I'm sorry sister. I can't change destiny, please forgive me," her words actually sounded sincere, despite the small smirk on her face. "I'll make them pay for damning my little sister that way." She had to find her first though.<p>Finally an image appeared in the mirror. A tiny cottage on the Joketsuko countryside. Her smirk broke out into a grin and she passed her hands over the floor. "Come fourth!"<p>Four tiny men appeared before her, from a magical circle that appeared on the ground. They were bald and held strange looking weapons in their hands. One held a spear with a crescent moon shaped blade; another had a giant pair of scissors in his hands; the last two had small curved swords.<p>"Go, make sure they suffer before you kill them," said the girl coldly. "Make sure Akane dies a quick death though. She is my sister after all."<p>The creatures all grinned evil looking smiles that seemed to split their faces in half. Rows of razor like metal teeth seemed to take up half of their heads. They giggled insanely before vanishing into the ground again.<p>Nabiki changed the image to reveal her sister, still tied up and sleeping against the wall. She kissed her fingers and placed them on the girl's image. "Goodbye Akane, you shall be missed." Her smile never wavered in the slightest.<p>++++++++++++<p>Next time: Isn't it obvious?<p>
