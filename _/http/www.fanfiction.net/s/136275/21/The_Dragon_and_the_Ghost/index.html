</div>The Dragon and the Ghost<p>Part 21<p>Someone's been reading Harry Potter, while listening to Anvil of Crom. [P.S. Thank Rob Zombie for getting me in the mood to finish this finally.] ; p<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome hated dungeon crawling, especially as a young nubile elven girl. Dark caverns were crawling with monsters, light caverns were far worse. They had traps and riddles, and all sorts of nasty thinking games to deal with. Evil people seemed to rely more on magical barriers and minions. She preferred things that way. This was even worse. It was a horrible collection of both, sewn together by four great wizards. Dungeons existed in schools to take care of magical overflow from student's mistakes, dark minions attracted to those who would choose the dark path, or summoned by them in some cases.<p>She held her torch out in front of her and walked calmly forward while peering at everything around her carefully. She paused as she came out of a doorway and into a room with many doors. "Shit. I hate these rooms." There were about fourteen different doors all around the room.<p>After a moment of thinking, the elven girl hung her head in defeat. She had no other choice but trial and error as the door she had entered from became sealed off. "Great." She walked straight across to the door opposite the solid wall that the entrance had become. It opened easily and revealed a rather unusual scene.<p>Three beautiful women sat on pedestals in a far corner of the next room. They stood up and called to her, revealing their nudity. There was a door on the opposite side of the room where he was standing, and a pathway too it. The rest of the room was covered in a small clear pool no more than a foot deep that separated the women from the path. They jumped up and down excitedly and waved to her, calling her name. "I bet they think they look like guys right now," she muttered with a small chuckle.<p>"No darling, we know exactly what we look like, just for you," said one of the trio silkily.<p>Ranma merely smirked and put her palm up. A small ball of orange light formed in her hands and she pointed it at the trio. "I have to concentrate to hold this spell. I haven't yet mastered it, as it is a bit too powerful for me. If I am distracted, you might get hurt." She walked calmly onto the pathway keeping the energy ball pointed at the three cowering women as the tried their best to shy away and look small. The energy vanished as she walked through the door on the opposite side of the room. "By the way ladies, I was bluffing. I use that spell to light campfires."<p>Anguished screams of rage filled the room as something large thrashed around in the water behind her.<p>The elven girl continued forward with a smirk on her face as she found herself standing at the doorway to a large stadium like arena. "Hmmm. This is more my kind of trap," she said with a small smirk as she slowly drew her sword. She had to focus on the door, or she'd wear herself out fighting and die. Her last trip to this room nearly had done just that. She'd been through the dungeon several times before, and it was never the same place twice. The same rooms might show up from time to time, but the dungeon would only lead you to where you wished to go if you proved yourself worthy.<p>She'd never failed the test.<p>All she had to do was make it to the other side.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Shinnosuke glared at the three children leading him into the dungeon and wondered how he'd suddenly been given escort duties. His memory wasn't particularly helpful in figuring it out. "How did we end up down here again?"<p>The bravest of the trio glanced back at him as he casually walked through the seemingly endless hallways. "We told you three times already. Someone is down here. They tied you up and left you in the supply closet. My guess is that strange elf everyone saw with you earlier. You probably don't remember who she is, or why she's down here."<p>Suzan glanced at the boy and frowned at him. "Since when did you get so smart?"<p>"I've been thinking about it since we've been down here," replied the boy with a small shrug. "What do you think Edmund?"<p>"I think this is great. If she's an elf, she probably has permission to be down here! We can go back!" He seemed quite pleased with himself.<p>"Well, not unless he can remember the way out," said Peter as he pointed at Shinnosuke. "Besides, why did she tie him up if she was supposed to be here?"<p>Shinnosuke had suddenly gone very ridged. For some strange reason, his memory decided to kick in at that very moment and reveal a very important fact about why he was down there. "Basilisk!"<p>The students turned to look at him and he scratched the back of his head. "What the heck is a Basilisk?" asked Edmund fearfully.<p>"I dunno, but there's one down here. I think I was supposed to be doing something about it with that elf girl. I'm not sure though." He looked quite serious as he said this.<p>"What?" gasped Suzan as she stared at him blankly. "So we're hunting some sort of monster?"<p>"Excellent!" said Peter cheerfully. "How bad can it be? Doesn't sound very intimidating really."<p>"Are you insane? We'll be killed!" cried Edmund.<p>"Can't be all that bad," replied the boy with a shrug.<p>"Peter, I don't like the sound of this one." Suzan had a slightly worried look on her face as she held her wand up like a torch and peered around the walls more carefully. A dull thumping sound behind her, followed by seven other's just like it caught her attention as she slowly turned her head back to see what the noise was. Her voice was very quiet and small sounding as she got their attention by clearing her throat. "Gentlemen, we have a very big problem. I think we found the Basilisk."<p>Shinnosuke glanced back at the gigantic Tarantula that had set down on the floor behind them. It looked to weigh a little over two tons and completely blocked the floor of the hallway. "No. A Basilisk is much bigger than that."<p>"WHAT!" cried Suzan as she struggled to pull her eyes away from the monster.<p>"Suddenly I'm not feeling quite so up to this," mumbled Peter dumbly as he backed away from the massive creature slowly. Everyone in the group was doing the exact same thing as it raised its front end up to expose its gigantic fangs.<p>Shinnosuke was actually smiling. "Get going. I'll catch up to you. I'm going to hold him off while you escape. Just don't get too far ahead of me."<p>"Let us help you!" snapped Peter as he pulled a torch from a nearby wall and tensed himself up. His wand had taken on an orange glow in his other hand and the torch's flame became a bit brighter.<p>Edmund was already trying to run away while Suzan held him in place with one hand while pointing her wand with the other. "I think we should listen to him Peter. I'm not sure if I can conjure anything that will hurt something that size just yet."<p>"The Basilisk is much bigger," reasoned Peter. "If we're going to fight it, this will be nothing."<p>"So we're doomed either way?" cried Edmund in horror.<p>"Do you really trust him to remember we're down here? Or which direction we ran in?" asked Peter.<p>"Get out of here! You're not strong enough!" growled Shinnosuke angrily. The monster was waving its legs at them as it lifted the front half of its body off the floor. The exit was completely blocked by the mass of the monster.<p>"We're not leaving you," said Peter firmly. "We'd just get lost and die without you around."<p>"If you stay, we'll have to kill it. That's much harder than simply getting away," said Shinnosuke. The giant spider had done little more than hiss at them threateningly so far and keep their attention as they slowly backed away. "We can't out run it."<p>"We seem to be doing fine," said Edmund as he glanced back at the door that led out of the hallway. The nearest one was almost a hundred yards away.<p>The spider started thumping forward, it was crawling slowly and staying just in front of them. Shinnosuke glanced back. "Go. Into that doorway, I'll hold it back while you get to it and follow when you're safe. Just do as I say all right?"<p>He jumped forward suddenly and arced the rake in his hand on top of the creature's face.<p>The beast hissed angrily as Shinnosuke pole-vaulted off its face and over its back. He landed on the floor and spun his weapon around his wrist as he prepared himself. "Come on! I'm the one you have to worry about!"<p>The children were all running towards the doorway. The spider ignored them and turned around to face the pathetic creature that had dared to strike it. Venom dripped from its fangs as it reared back and hissed at him.<p>The boy blocked as the creature began to pound on him with its legs as it pushed him back in the other direction. His weapon held against the gigantic legs of the two-ton monster as he used it to block the strikes. It swiped at him with one of its front legs and tossed him into the air towards one of the walls.<p>He grunted as he twisted in the air and landed feet first against the stone. He pushed off with his feet and swiped at the monster's head as he passed over it again. Its torso slammed into the ground from the force of the blow and he twisted to land behind the beast once again.<p>It was a little slow turning around and he turned and started running towards the door. He could see one of the children standing just outside of it with a firm looking frown on her face. "Hurry up you showoff!"<p>"Get inside!" he screamed angrily.<p>The spider had recovered and was gaining quickly as he drew closer to the door. It was tearing down walls as it scrambled after him in a rage. Large clouds of dust and rubble were coming down just behind him as he charged towards the open door.<p>Susan scrambled back inside as fast as her legs could carry her at the sight of the creature.<p>Shinnosuke sighed as he hung his head after diving through the door. One of the giant legs reached in and scraped the ground just behind him. They all backed away from the monster and further into the new room. After a moment, the monster moved away.<p>"Stay and fight it?" snapped Suzan as he slapped Peter upside his head rather firmly.<p>"Ouch. Sorry," he grumbled sheepishly.<p>"Where are we now?" asked Edmund as he looked around. The room did not appear very threatening at all really.<p>Torches lit the walls around them and various jewels seemed to be embedded into the paintings on the walls. "This is neat. I bet you there's a fortune in jewels on those walls."<p>Shinnosuke glanced around cautiously as he stood up. Suzan noticed this and frowned slightly at the carelessness of the two boys. Peter and Edmund were gazing at the ancient artwork on the walls.<p>"Don't touch anything," warned the girl. "We don't know what this place is exactly."<p>"Right," grumbled their guide miserably. "Something about this place..."<p>"The whole room sparkles," said Edmund as he looked around. Jewels were shining everywhere.<p>"Get out your wands," said Shinnosuke angrily. There were shiny objects everywhere. "When they come, use a light spell. Light hurts them, but it won't kill them." He ripped the rake off the end of his staff and placed it in his bag. Without saying a word he took a pair of glowing white crystals out of the same place and placed them in either end of his weapon. There were holes already prepared for this purpose. "Wraiths."<p>"Shit," grumbled Peter. The torches around them had started to go out on their own, one by one. Even the one in his hand became useless as some sort of magic sucked the heat out of the room. The air became chilled as it became pitch black.<p>The lights of three wands quickly joined the soft glow of Shinnosuke's staff as they moved closer together in the darkness.<p>"They probably haven't taught you, but you can make a beam out of a light spell if you just point it and will it to happen. It's not difficult once you have the spell ready. It will stun them for a moment and hold them back. You've got to be quick though, you'll only be able to stun one or two at a time."<p>"Right," said the three young wizards as they glanced around the room carefully. All of them were standing back to back in the middle of the room. "Come on. We'll need to leave. They'll be after us soon. They'll follow us. We need to find more light."<p>A high pitched screaming noise sounded in the near distance.<p>"Here they come," growled Shinnosuke as he turned towards the source of the noise. "They'll know we can't turn back because of the spider. They'll be blocking our route forward."<p>Susan blushed despite herself. He was handsome when he was commanding and serious, he also seemed much smarter. It was too bad a complete idiot replaced him when things calmed down.<p>The shadows in front of him began to move and melt into what looked like hooded darkness crawling across the wall.<p>"Follow me!" The guide charged forward and spun his staff towards the wall just as one of the monsters began to push out of the wall and take form. A beam of light shot from the tip of his staff and through the creature's head. It seemed to explode as streams of light escaped from it's still forming face before it shattered away. "I can kill them, but you can only hold them back. So stay close to me! These things swarm."<p>"Swarm? You mean like bees?" muttered Edmund in horror.<p>Slowly, more shrieks started to echo through the darkened corridors in either direction.<p>"Something is wrong. There's far too much activity in this place," said Shinnosuke. "It's usually not this bad."<p>Suzan piped up suddenly. "I read something about this place once. It's a test, depending on what you want to do down here. It challenges you to make sure you're ready to do it. If the task is too difficult for you..."<p>"You don't make it," said Shinnosuke with a serious nod. "I've been in worse spots than this."<p>"Really?" asked Peter. "Do you think you could tell me about it when we get out of this?"<p>"Not really, no," said their guide honestly. "I do remember not liking Wraiths, so I'm pretty sure I've done this before."<p>Susan whapped the boy upside his head once again.<p>"Ow! Hey! I was just askin," he muttered under his breath.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma spun her sword around her wrist over her head and placed it back into its scabbard. The front legs of the giant spider in front of her fell away and it fumbled around with its face dragging across the floor. She put her foot down and squashed the contents. That always got all sorts of weird green goo all over the bottom of her shoe when she did it.<p>The beast wasn't nearly as large as the one Shinnosuke had faced, but there were around twenty of them a few minutes before. A long trail of small dead monsters littered her path as she looked back and fourth across the giant coliseum. She was halfway through it. She paused when she suddenly realized there was something different about her surroundings. There was a small table sitting in the center of the room. A black longbow and a full quiver of arrows were just sitting there. The surface of the wood was highly polished black wood, and its craftsmanship was extraordinary.<p>"What the hell?" she muttered as she glanced down at the note attached. "You will earn the price of this in the course of your journey. Take it, it will aid you."<p>She narrowed her eyes as she gazed over the note. "It could be a trap." She hadn't seen anything crawling out of the darkness around her for quite a few moments either. That was very unusual in this room.<p>She passed her hands over the table and very close to the weapons. There were no strange feelings from either of them. That did not mean they were safe though. She closed her eyes and contemplated her situation. "All right. I'll bite."<p>She picked up the bow and arrows and hooked them over her back carefully. They were definitely magical items of some sort, and she'd probably need them in the near future. Dungeons like this one had a way of giving you what you needed, but it could also deceive you with a trap disguised as something you needed.<p>Ranma didn't think she particularly needed a bow. Her skill in the weapon was definitely lower than the average elf girl's. In the end, that had been why she had decided to take it. A living dungeon wouldn't tempt her with something it knew she probably wouldn't want. Then again, she'd taken it.<p>She was feeling strangely pensive about moving forward suddenly. The whole situation was starting to get to her. It was going almost too well. There was going to be some sort of payback for that later. She just knew it. She was now far enough away from where she'd acquired the bow that she was fairly certain it was not a trap.<p>The door was only a few hundred yards away now. She'd probably walked miles across the room already, even though it hadn't looked near this large when she'd entered. It was done by screwing around with scale and perception, and a magical endless opponent-generating spell. Fortunately, it couldn't make anything that could cast spells. As such, she was stuck fighting barbarians, spiders, snakes, giant lizards, ogres, trolls, goblins, and the usual assortment of stock evil henchmen. She hated the giant purple dinosaurs the most. They were easy to kill, but god they were annoying. Around twenty of them littered the ground behind her.<p>She shrugged after a moment of walking and passed through the door unopposed. "That was kind of disappointing," she grumbled as she glanced back into the room again. She'd have to tell off that idiot wizard for shutting off her fun when she finished the job. She was going to have to find her way into this room more often in the future.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ryuu Kumon had rings under his eyes. Mousse seemed somewhat cheerful for once, and Ukyo and Shampoo were sitting on the back of a tattered looking cart that slowly drifted down an open road. Ryuu had procured it for them earlier that evening from a farm they had crossed. He left the farmer his animals as they still had the two horses from the military camp with them.<p>"Why are we going east?" asked Shampoo.<p>"Let me worry about that," replied Ryuu calmly.<p>Ukyo snorted and continued to stare out across the open green fields that surrounded them on all sides. It was a warm day, and the countryside was quite beautiful.<p>"Um, will Ranma meet us there?" asked Shampoo.<p>Ukyo's attention was caught for a moment, and a small frown was directed at Shampoo.<p>"I already told you, I don't know. Maybe, maybe not."<p>"Here we go again," muttered Mousse as his mood suddenly fell. He moved up onto the driver's seat with Ryuu.<p>"Where do you get off asking about my Ranchan that way?" grumbled Ukyo. "He's already told us he doesn't know."<p>"He does know, he just doesn't want to tell us," grumbled Shampoo as she glared at the two boys for a moment. "He's obviously hiding something."<p>"He's good at that," said Ukyo coolly. "I'm the one who should ask about him. I know why you're so interested in whether or not he'll be there."<p>"I don't see a ring on his finger," replied the elven girl calmly. "Besides, if he does choose you for some odd reason, I'm sure he'll lose interest when you start to grow old. He'll remain the same for centuries. Did you know that?"<p>Ukyo, and everyone else on the cart turned towards the elf.<p>Shampoo was looking quite smug with herself as she continued to watch the countryside.<p>Ukyo's face was definitely shocked. "What?"<p>"His curse will keep him young, he will age as my people do. I'm patient, if you get to him first, I'll have him sooner or later."<p>Ryuu frowned and watched the road ahead of them. Ranma didn't talk much about his curse, and he didn't ask. What the elf had told them was probably true, if Mousse's reaction was any indication.<p>The drow was growling quietly as he clenched his fist. He seemed angry, and frustrated. The boy had eyes enough to see what had caught his attention. Personally, there was no way he'd get hung over any woman that much. He hated hanging around magical types anyway. They had a way of making him think about his own mortality. It was damned annoying. "Will you two shut up? I don't care if Ranma lives to be a thousand. I'm sick and tired of hearing you two bitch every time someone brings up his damned name!<p>Ukyo frowned at him and looked somewhat hurt by his insensitivity. She'd just found out the man of her dreams was practically immortal. She had some serious thinking to do about their relationship. She knew he'd love her anyway, but it was something she felt she should prepare herself for.<p>Shampoo just gave the boy an annoyed frown and went back to watching the road. It was a shame. Loosening Kuonji's hold on her future husband was a good way to pass the time. Perhaps it was just as well to let her stew on that for a while. By the time Ranma met them again, she would have crushed the girl's feelings with doubt.<p>Both of them stared at each other from opposite sides of the cart. Each one was giving the other their coldest hardest stare.<p>Ryuu glanced over his shoulder. "Don't make me turn this cart around and take us back to that military camp! I'll do it if you two don't cut it out right now!"<p>Both of the females turned their eyes away from each other as if nothing had happened.<p>"I'm starting to regret promising Ranma I'd get her back in one piece."<p>Mousse decided that silence was the better part of valor anyway. He'd just discovered that he needed to be rid of Ranma. Deciding the best time to do that was important, and he had no illusions that it might be easy. It would probably be a few days at least before they met up with the cursed boy. He had plenty of time to think it over.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Shinnosuke frowned as he realized he was going to be in serious trouble when he got back. He'd somehow managed to drag three kids into the dungeon with him, and he had no idea why he was there. All he knew was he was surrounded by wraiths, with three students. They were helpful at the moment, but would quickly run out of magic.<p>Susan shrieked as a bony clawed hand swiped at her from just outside the soft blue light that surrounded them all. The group had their backs to each other and pointed their weapons into the darkness. Shinnosuke's staff was shielding them from the darkness.<p>The wraiths screamed and cried angrily all around them. None of them could hear anything but a painful ringing any longer.<p>Peter's wand was glowing fiercely as he stepped with the rest of the group towards the stone doorway a few yards to their right. It was a dusty looking laboratory. Ancient carpets covered the floors. The shelves were lined with books, and bottles and beakers full of long forgotten liquids lined the top of the worktable in the middle of the room.<p>"What is this place?" muttered Edmund through his tears. He was crying and didn't care who knew about it. "How do we get out of here?"<p>"There are dozens of them. I'm not sure about this," grumbled Shinnosuke. "Last time I had help..." His voice trailed off. "Um, I think."<p>"What are we? Chopped liver?" grumbled Peter irritably.<p>"Turn it down a notch or you'll burn off all your magic. You won't be much help then," replied Shinnosuke irritably.<p>"What about that elf girl?" asked Suzan.<p>"Elf girl?" said Shinnosuke in confusion.<p>"The one who tied you up!" snapped the girl angrily. They passed through the doorway leaving the room full of wraiths behind them. The creatures shrieked angrily, but Shinnosuke had tilted his staff towards the door. The monsters could not enter through the beam of light that shined through the door.<p>"Doesn't matter much now. We've got to keep moving. I can't hold them forever. It won't take them long to try and find another way to get to us."<p>The children went quiet and moved through the room.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma arched her eyebrow as she strolled into the open room. It seemed to be empty and made completely of symmetrical cube blocks. When she reached the center of the room, both doors closed as heavy stone slabs slid into place. There were four torches, two on either side of the two doors. Nothing had happened yet and she glanced around.<p>"Well? I'm waiting."<p>A low rumbling filled the room as ten of the blocks in the floor and ceiling began to shake out of the floor. They linked together by floating into a humanoid shape. The holes on the floor were filled with dangerous spikes, and flames shot down from the open holes on the ceiling occasionally.<p>"Not bad." Ranma was impressed as the creature lumbered towards her. She pulled the sword off her back and narrowed her eyes at the swirling black and white ball of power that had formed in the center of the thing's chest.<p>The creature slammed one of its arms into the ground where she had been standing. The girl deftly skipped aside and hopped across one of the spike pits. The creature slowly turned towards her and jerked its arm towards her. The arm elongated sending the stone at the end into the opposite wall. Ranma had ducked sideways to avoid the shot and looked up at the block that hung over her in the air nervously. She still had her sword drawn and slid out of the way by rotating her torso as it crashed to the ground and slid back over to the monster again.<p>"Woah." One of the jets of flames shot down from the ceiling near her. It was incredibly hot and she started to sweat almost instantly. "Damn."<p>The monster was getting faster, it rotated and moved its arm in a waving motion sending blocks at her at different heights. She moved forward by jumping through them and using them as stepping-stones to reach the creature. She hacked at the head and the blade did little more than leave a trail of sparks behind. "Great!" The blocks had formed a solid wall on the opposite side of the room. They shot back onto the monster as one and reformed as they had before.<p>The girl had been forced to skip to the side to avoid it. "Now what?" A weapon wouldn't hurt that glowing energy, and she wasn't sure what it was.<p>The creature paused under one of the flame jets and the head stone began to glow red. She smirked as she jumped into the air and hacked at it. The stone block shattered and crumbled across the ground smoking. She twisted and managed to shatter two more before the flames stopped.<p>The creature rumbled and began to shift again.<p>"Now what?" The spikes and flames severely limited her movement. The stone blocks had begun to spin in the air around the ball of black and white power. It swirled violently as a light blue and red iris appeared in the center of the energy.<p>"Aw man." Ranma dashed as fast as she could away from the first block it sent flying out at her. The stones began to move faster and lash out violently slamming into walls randomly all around the room.<p>Ranma moved as fast as she could as she flipped and juked around the mess in the air. "I can't keep this up long! Think!" She landed on her back after a particularly close call and rolled aside as another one slammed into the ground from above.<p>The flame jets all came to life at once, and stayed on. The room had become a very dangerous oven. "Damn!" The girl was drenched in sweat and running out of options. Something clicked in her head and she frowned. "I hope this works."<p>She pulled the bow from her back and notched an arrow. It was difficult as she jumped and ducked under a few of the blocks. Finally she started to run to the left, the arrowhead was glowing with a bright white power. The monster screeched as she let the arrow fly. It slammed into the side of the eye and flashed. The light shattered the energy and the blocks all fell to the ground from wherever they were. Ranma was spared having to dodge another one and sighed as she watched the door slide open.<p>"This thing is enchanted. Cool." It was the bow, and not the arrows. She could tell by the intricate carvings on the wood. She hadn't really noticed them before. It was a common spell used to make expensive weapons look normal. It was protection from people like her, and she was used to seeing it. "I'm surprised it took me this long to notice. Huh."<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo stood on a grassy hill under a black sky. The stars were obscured from vision by the black smoke that rose high into the air. She frowned as she watched her knights marched into the village before her. Homes burned, everything burned. The emperor was unhappy with the escape of the thieves within his camp.<p>Her helmet was clutched at her side after a moment and she growled angrily as she watched the unfocused wrath of her master. Everything in their path would burn as they moved to the east, towards the mountains. "Damn. I can't focus."<p>Pieces of the thief's words floated in her mind. Betrayed, murdered, without honor. Things he'd said about her father. "We're engaged." She turned her eyes towards the ground. "Why? Why? Damn." Anger welled up inside her, but she wasn't sure why. A slaughter before her, it was nothing of interest. "I need a good fight."<p>"Not to your tastes?" asked Nabiki as she walked up behind her sister. She was dressed in a long black dress and held a crystal ball full of black light. She seemed to glide to her sister's hide.<p>Akane snorted. "How long do you intend to hid that child from the Emperor? You're going to have to leave soon, before he notices it."<p>Nabiki's smile faltered for the briefest of moments.<p>"You're not the type to get sick Nabiki. My tent is right next to yours. Can't hide it with your magic?"<p>The older woman merely smirked. "How long do you intend to hide what you know from him? Who is this other you speak of?"<p>The girl replaced her helmet and began tightening the leather straps that held her armor in place. "I've got a battle to attend. If you'll excuse me."<p>Nabiki's smile turned into a frown. "Damn." She turned away angrily and stormed back towards the camp. She waved her hand and a gateway of energy opened up before her. Akane had her. She could not use her secret against her. She turned her head back towards the girl. "Unfortunate that you had to discover this sister. I'll have to be rid of you now. It's too dangerous to allow you to know this. Besides, I'll need to learn that secret of yours before I'm rid of you. That will provide me some solace for your loss." She laughed to herself as the doorway closed behind her.<p>Akane was standing at the entrance to the village. The gate burned above her as she hacked an unfortunate man in half as he charged her with a pitchfork. "I have to tell him. He's about to become a god after all. I have no choice but to follow him."<p>Her men began to form around her as she walked through the flames, their armor keeping them protected from the heat as it cooked any of the remaining villagers enough to reduce them to running through the streets in agony. Another spray of blood too her right sent someone's head into her path. She calmly kicked it away without breaking stride and continued forward. "When it's finished burning, clear a path through the middle. We'll march through here in the morning."<p>"Of course," replied one of the knights coldly.<p>What did she care if her father had no honor. What honor did she have left anyway?<p>"I want a body count and the polished skulls of everyone in the village before we report back to the Emperor. It will make a nice gift for him."<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Saffron sat on satin pillows with winged men kneeling in front of him. He was hidden behind a thin veil of white and simply sat with his eyes closed. Candles burned all around him as the two lead men glared up at him firmly. Behind each of them was ten more of the winged men, all dressed in battle armor and armed with swords and arrows.<p>"I want them. Go, find them. Bring them back, dead or alive."<p>"Very well."<p>They stood up and turned, marching out of the room in file. The two lead men walked out the door and in front of the group. "Masara."<p>"What is it?" growled the other.<p>"I do not think the Captain was the victim of lord Herb."<p>"Koruma..." muttered the other in a warning tone. "He never did like her much."<p>"He respected her enough that he would not eat her. Lord Herb was anything but mad when Lord Saffron killed him. He may have killed her, but he would have left the body, and not those torn pieces we found."<p>"The Emperor himself told us that was her fate. It is not wise to question that, not even for her."<p>"My loyalty was with her," replied Koruma coldly. "I will discover her killer, and avenge her."<p>"We have other matters to attend," growled Masara irritably. "You shouldn't speak of such things in front of the men. We'll discuss it later." He stormed ahead of his companion and spread his wings as he reached the edge of the camp.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ryuu Kumon smiled as he clicked his cheek at the horses and snapped the reigns lazily. They were trotting along a beautiful road in a bright green field. The mountains ahead of them grew closer and he looked up at the sky with a wistful smile. "Sure is peaceful isn't it?"<p>"How long do we leave them like this?" asked Mousse from his seat beside the man. Even with the glasses, all the light around him was starting to give him a headache. He had his eyes shut and seemed irritated.<p>"You can let them out when you can open your eyes again," said Ryuu quietly.<p>Mousse growled angrily. Shampoo would be furious with him, he couldn't risk fumbling about the cart, and he really was nearly blind with his eyes open anyway. The pain would grow quickly if he opened his eyes. "Where the hell are we?"<p>"Its called light pass," said Ryuu cheerfully. "You're the first of your kind to ever pass this way."<p>"Gee, I wonder why." The drow wasn't happy. "How long?"<p>"We'll be through by tomorrow," said Ryuu cheerfully. "It never gets dark here. Not much point in stopping to camp I guess." He glanced over his shoulder and smiled at Ukyo and Shampoo.<p>Both of them growled angrily from under the ropes and gags. They were lying on their backs and struggling with their bonds to reach the pair sitting in front of them.<p>"Ah. This is the way to travel. No noise, no distractions..." He seemed at peace and content. "Son of a bitch."<p>"What?" asked Mousse.<p>"Hang on."<p>The drow's eyes flew open as he heard the sound of a sword being drawn. "Damn!" He couldn't see more than a foot in front of his face, everything else was a bright blur. "Why did you have to come through here?"<p>Ryuu was looking up at the sky and cutting the ropes off his prisoners. He didn't bother with the gags, but they were quickly removed as two legs slammed into his stomach. He was thrown off the cart and rolled in the field for a few yards. The horses ignored this and continued trotting lazily.<p>"You!" snarled Shampoo as she leveled a glare at Mousse. He was actually kind of glad he didn't have to see it.<p>"He cut you loose because we're being attacked," said the drow calmly. He pulled two curved swords out of his sleeves and jumped down after Ryuu.<p>"Damn!" growled Ukyo as she hopped off the cart after him. "I'm gonna kick his ass when we're through!"<p>"Attacked?" muttered Shampoo. There was nothing to attack them anywhere in sight. She turned her eyes down the road behind them and drifted her eyes towards the sky. "Oh."<p>There were around twenty of them. They were flying in two V formations towards them. "Saffron's people! No!" She jumped off the cart and rushed towards her friends.<p>The horses continued to trot merrily along for a few more meters and seemed to realize that no one was riding. They stopped and glanced around for a moment. After a moment, they spotted them moving away in the other direction. Both of them glanced at each other and simply stood there.<p>Shampoo and Ukyo paused as they noticed Ryuu take up a combat stance they hadn't seen from him before. He had his broadsword held upright and simply looked up at the sky with a strange smirk on his face.<p>"You don't look worried," commented Ukyo as she readied herself a few yards away from him.<p>"Just stay out of the way. I haven't been riding Ranma's coattails to fame you know. I had to earn my place on this team. Before I became Dragon Ghost, I had another name."<p>Shampoo and Mousse were just behind the two of them. "Aren't we even going to try and run?"<p>"You don't sound concerned, but why are your eyes closed? Really Mousse," grumbled the elf girl irritably.<p>"How many are there?" he asked simply. "I'm nearly blind anyway Shampoo. I'll do well enough without my eyes."<p>"About fifty," commented the elven girl. "We're still out of range. It's not too late to run."<p>"Run where?" Ukyo did not like her position at all and clutched her spear nervously. "They'd outrun us, and there are walls of solid rock on either side of us!"<p>Ryuu seemed amused by this. "Heh. Ranma and I practice two different schools of the same art. He's not stronger than I am. You're making a big mistake by thinking that. The Black Swordsman does not run from a fight."<p>"Oh shit," muttered Ukyo as she stepped back away from the boy and fell on her rear.<p>Shampoo and Mousse were both surprised by this reaction.<p>Ryuu simply pulled a short sword from his back that none of them had ever seen him use before. It was tucked sideways along the small of his back. "We can't run. The valley closes us in on all sides. I didn't think they'd bother looking for us this way."<p>"Why try so hard to find us? We didn't get our hands on anything." Shampoo looked a little more than irritated.<p>"They think me and Ranma have something to do with some kind of prophecy," replied the boy calmly. The flying soldiers began to dive towards them with their spears held ready.<p>Ryuu merely gripped his swords a bit harder and looked up at them fearlessly. "Heh. Don't move."<p>Mousse growled angrily. "I'm going to make you pay for this Kumon."<p>"Huh?" The boy glanced over his shoulder in confusion and jumped back as the spear-wielding enemies planted themselves into the ground and took off again. The next wave was closing in fast.<p>"This way!" The elven boy started running towards the mountains. "I know a way out of this."<p>"You can't see you idiot! How are you going to lead us anywhere?"<p>"There are more senses than just sight," replied the drow as he opened his eyes ever so slightly.<p>"We should be doing something right?" Ukyo spun her spear around and swiped up at the air, forcing the next wave to back off before they reached the ground. They were forming a larger group and hovering in the air above them. Occasionally one of them would have to dodge a dropped spear as they ran after Mousse towards one of the mountains.<p>A large ball of flames erupted from Shampoo's hands as she stopped and pointed upwards for a moment. The birdmen scattered away from the magic and fluttered about in confusion for a few moments. Dropped weapons rained down on the ground behind them. Before she had turned back, they were already diving to retrieve them.<p>The group rushed up to a solid wall or rock, and the birdmen started laughing.<p>"All right blind boy, if we live through this I'm gonna kick your ass for this one." Ryuu readied himself again and gripped both his swords.<p>The blind drow snorted and put his hand on the rock surface. It slid open as a door like pattern of runes appeared.<p>Shampoo gasped in shock and almost forgot about the enemy. "Drow!"<p>"What is this place?" grumbled Ukyo nervously as she flashed quick glances between the door and the airborne creatures.<p>"Home." Mousse stepped into the shadows. Shampoo, Ukyo, and Ryuu all moved in behind them. The birdmen were landing on the ground behind them and rushing after them. "They won't chase us far into these tunnels. I know my way around them."<p>Shampoo's eyes were wide as she stumbled behind Mousse. "You...you're a..."<p>"Yes," he replied simply.<p>"What are you doing you idiot?" Ukyo had been following the others and noticed Ryuu was still standing in the doorway with a wide grin on his face.<p>"I told you, the Black Swordsman doesn't run from a fight. He says they won't follow us far. I'm making sure they don't follow us at all."<p>As if in answer to the challenge, the creatures charged through the open doorway with their spears held forward.<p>"Heh. Don't move!"<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Masara and Koruma stood back as their men moved into the cavern after the criminals. "Things seem to be going well." Masara glanced over his shoulder at his companion.<p>The other simply fluttered his wings. "Something doesn't feel right about this."<p>"What could go wrong?"<p>A series of waves of solid air shot out of the cavern in a wide curving arc, along with severed pieces of their soldiers. There were also hundreds of feathers that blasted almost a hundred yards out of the cave.<p>"Son of a bitch!" was the stereo exclamation.<p>The stone wall slid shut and the runes protecting it glimmered for a moment before fading completely.<p>The pair simply looked at the ground in shock with what was left of their forces. Only ten out of fifty had survived.<p>"What was that?" muttered Masara nervously.<p>"I'm not dumb enough to find out." His companion turned away and spread his wings. The others quickly followed.<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma smirked as she glanced around the room. She had just placed a glowing crystal orb into one of five slots. The one she had just placed was glowing blue, while four others of varying colors sat in similar slots in the wall. A line of blue light formed from the wall too the floor and into a junction with lights from the other crystals. "Done."<p>The entire wall of the circular stone room shifted to the right for about ten feet, revealing an opening in what had appeared to be a carving of a door. "Glad that's over with," she muttered as she wiped some sweat from her brow. "Now what?"<p>The floor of the room she was in was covered in sand. It was a large round room, with no visible door. Even her entrance had vanished. "Wonder what the heck this is?" she muttered as she glanced around and did not move. "Never been here before, this might take a minute." She remained in position and glanced around cautiously. There was a single window that looked into a dark hallway at about chest height.<p>"Great. I'll bet it's already triggered." She didn't look pleased and started to mull her problem.<p>It was right about then that a groaning sound started from the ceiling above her.<p>"Uh oh."<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Shinnosuke frowned as he entered a long stone hallway with the children following closely behind them. The light of their wands was starting to flicker. Edmund's was fading fastest, but the other children wouldn't last much longer either.<p>"How much further is it?" grumbled Edmund irritably.<p>"We don't know!" snapped Susan. She was starting to get in a foul mood herself.<p>Peter was following ahead of both of them, just behind Shinnosuke as they navigated the narrow passage. "I'm just glad those nasty things are gone."<p>"I'm not sure how long it will take them to find us again." The eldest in the group didn't look. "I'm more worried about finding a way to get you out of here. I can worry about the monster later. I'm just hoping we don't run into it."<p>"Right." The boy hung his head slightly and sighed. "I don't think we're leaving unless we go through whatever that thing is."<p>"Hey dumbass! A little help here?"<p>Everyone in the group blinked as they saw an arm sticking through a narrow opening in the wall ahead. There was torchlight coming through the small window.<p>"What's this?" muttered Susan as she moved ahead of the group. "It's a girl!"<p>Ranma was frowning at them from what appeared to be prison bars. "Hello! Shinnosuke, get over here and help me you idiot!"<p>"Who are you? What are you doing here?" cried the angry looking boy as he pointed at her.<p>"Goddamnit, not now you idiot. Just get over here and give me a hand will ya?"<p>"Wait!" The girl with them moved to stop him as he started to walk forward. "How do you know his name? You're the one who knocked him out I'll bet! Just what are you doing down here anyway?"<p>"Hey. You're right!" agreed Peter. The redhead turned to look at him and growled angrily. He took a step back and paused. She was a total babe. "Still, I wouldn't feel right just leaving her there."<p>"What's wrong with her anyway?" grumbled Susan as she moved a little closer to the window. "She's perfectly fine."<p>The redhead glanced up at the ceiling nervously. The window was low to the ground and she had to crouch to reach it. It hadn't taken her long to notice the wall had a tight spiral carved into it. The ceiling was still ten feet over her, but it was slowly pushing itself downward. The sand on the floor was also moving higher at a slow rate. She wasn't sure just how much time she had. "Crap. They're useless. Think, damn it."<p>"I am not useless!" snapped Susan angrily.<p>"That wasn't a very nice thing to say at all!" agreed Shinnosuke.<p>Ranma snorted as she took her attention off her problem for a moment. "I'm so gonna kick your ass when I get out of this Shinnosuke."<p>The man stepped back with a confused looking frown. "Wait. What's this elf girl doing here anyway?"<p>Suzan peered through the bars a little closer. Ranma reached her arm down with amazing speed and pulled her collar. Her head fit between the bars and the trapped elf pointed up. The flat surface of the ceiling slid into a carved groove in the ceiling, revealing rows of sharp off center metal spikes. The look on the redhead's face was almost comical as the spikes slowly started to rotate. "If you're going to just stand out there get along the wall and shut up. I've got a lot to think about."<p>Susan nodded fiercely and backed away as soon as she landed. She couldn't take her eyes off the inside of the room as the redhead searched around for the switch to turn off the trap. She seemed calm and careful as she moved her eyes across the walls inside.<p>"What should we do?" muttered Peter dumbly. "Maybe there's a switch out here?"<p>"Start looking! I haven't got all day for you to discuss this you know!" snapped the redhead irritably.<p>"A strange way to ask for help!" snapped the girl as she turned her nose up. She wasn't feeling quite so sorry for her anymore. The men were all looking around at the nearby walls carefully.<p>Ranma knew she was running out of time. The ceiling was now only a few feet above her. "Now what?" She couldn't see or feel anything inside the cell. She knew where the door was, but not how to open it."<p>She turned her eyes towards Shinnosuke. The boy was leaning against the wall with a thoughtful frown on his face. His staff was glowing and lit up the area around him quite well. "Son of a..." The trap over her head groaned a bit and she clenched her teeth and notched an arrow in the bow she had just pulled off her back.<p>The tip of the arrow began to glow with a bright white light as she aimed it towards him.<p>Shinnosuke froze in place as he noticed this.<p>Suzan turned and stared in a sort of horrified awe as the elven girl let the arrow fly and impaled it into the wall between Shinnosuke's head and his staff. The shaft of the arrow was touching his cheek and the wood.<p>"I didn't do it! I swear!" he cried fearfully. He didn't notice the runes that had started glowing just behind his head.<p>"You jerk! Why didn't you move!" The wall of the hallway slid open and dumped sand onto the floor. There was a clicking sound over her head and her angry glare quickly turned into fear as she rolled out of the room and into the hallway.<p>All of them were watching the scene dumbly as the spikes came crashing down. A heavy chain with a breakaway link at the end slid loudly into the hallway at the redhead's feet. She pushed herself off the floor and brushed the sand off her body. She then grabbed her bow and pulled the arrow out of the tiny notch in the wall. She checked them both and put them away before turning towards Shinnosuke.<p>"What are you doing down here? Don't you know it's dangerous?"<p>"No. I had no idea." She hooked her fist across his jaw and kicked him in the ribs when he landed. "I don't believe this! You asked me to marry you once and you were ready to just watch me die? I should kill you just on the principal of it!"<p>The boy staggered to his feet and blinked. "You're..."<p>"Oh, now you remember. Tough, I said no and I meant it."<p>The children were all staring at the scene in a sort of horrified wonder.<p>Ranma turned her head back as if she had just realized they were there. "What the hell is this?"<p>"Who are you? What are you doing here?" asked the girl as her cheeks flushed.<p>"I'm a heartless mercenary that was hired to come down here and get something. I could care less whether you live or die kid. This guy was supposed to help me." She leveled a glare at him as he stood up. "He's more a liability on this job though, so I got rid of him for a little while. Well, I tried too anyway."<p>Shinnosuke's face flushed a bit and he turned away from them. "Come on. I've got to find a way to get them out of here."<p>"Sounds like a great idea! I'll just go find the stone and you get these kids back to safety!" The redhead smiled cheerfully and pointed down the hallway back the way they had come. "The exit is that way."<p>"We can't go back. They don't have enough strength to make it past those wraiths again." Shinnosuke frowned and nodded in the opposite direction. "I need to find a safe place for them to rest, and an alternate exit. There's a couple down here. All of em are dangerous though, there are tons of traps."<p>"Duh. This is a dungeon you idiot." Ranma gave a heavy sigh as she nodded. "Fine. We go this way then. Don't get in my way, I'm not looking for the exit until I finish the job."<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Three children and their guide walked through a stone arched doorway into a dead end room.<p>"Great, this is where the passage ends," grumbled Susan.<p>"We're trapped!" cried Edmund.<p>"I dunno, this is a pretty big room. I'm sure there's a way out somewhere." Peter seemed more reserved about rushing into the room now, but still led the group and glanced around.<p>It was an empty dungeon room with torches lighting the cold stone walls and floors. Everything was damp and covered in lichen and mosses. The metal torch holders were all a corroded green. The room was open with stone pillars built to support the ceiling and hold the torches up. There was a stone ledge on the opposite side of the room about ten feet off the ground. Most of the pillars around it had fallen and the remains littered the ground.<p>Ranma walked into the room behind them with her arms crossed over her chest.<p>"Look at what?" asked Peter dumbly.<p>Ranma paused and stared at Shinnosuke irritably.<p>"What is this place?" muttered Susan.<p>"It's too quiet." Edmund was shaking visibly and glancing around much more erratically than his friends.<p>Shinnosuke moved ahead of the group as he saw a blue light shining on the other side of the room. There were several of the stone pillars that blocked his view. The torches only lit the center area of the room, leaving the edges pitch black with shadows that crawled throughout the room. Anything could be hiding within the darkness around them. "There's something over there."<p>The children all turned their heads in unison towards the area Shinnosuke had indicated with the tip of his staff.<p>Susan gasped as she moved ahead of the group a bit and walked into the room towards the strange light. "Lucy!"<p>No one noticed Ranma glance around nervously and vanish from sight behind them as they rushed towards the fallen girl.<p>"Huh?" muttered the braver of the two boys as he moved up to her side. "Look! We've found her!"<p>"Is this what we were looking for?" asked Shinnosuke in confusion. He saw the girl lying on the stone floor bathed in the blue light. She was about twenty yards ahead of them on her back. The young girl was filthy, her blonde hair matted down and covered in filth and dirt. She was younger than the other children by about two years. Her breath was visible in the light her friends carried as her chest slowly rose and fell.<p>"Lucy! Wake up!" cried the girl as she fell to her knees beside the child. "Come on. We've..." Her voice trailed off as she realized that the girl wasn't even stirring. "What's she doing down here? She went missing a week ago."<p>"We should ask her." Edmund seemed quite eager to take the girl out of there. "Come on. I'm sure we can find help for her back at the school." He leaned over her and peered curiously at her. "Come on, wake up." The gentle nudging of his foot did nothing to make her stir.<p>"Something is wrong with her. She's not moving." Peter knelt down beside her opposite Susan. "I don't think we're going to wake her up down here."<p>"That means we may have to carry her." Shinnosuke didn't look pleased with the idea. He glanced around at the children and sighed. "What's this light anyway..." His tone trailed off as he glanced up to see a small pedestal with a blue stone sitting on it. It was little more than a pillar that had broken off at about waist level. "What's this?"<p>Peter arched his eyebrow and left Lucy's side to gaze at the strange rock. "I dunno. We should take it with us."<p>Shinnosuke turned to look at him for a moment. "Huh?"<p>"Might be useful." The boy seemed to think it was perfectly reasonable.<p>"I guess so." With a heavy sigh, the groundskeeper picked the stone up and put it into the bag at his side. He stopped cold as he realized that the shadows in the dark corner of the room directly in front of them had started to move. "Say. What's that?"<p>Peter's eyes went wide as he stumbled back. It was a serpent as thick as a car, and it was uncoiling itself. "Oh shit."<p>"Watch your language!" snapped Susan angrily as she covered Lucy's ears and glared up at them both.<p>Edmund was confused by the older boy's sudden outburst. "What's up Pete?"<p>"Don't let it look you in the eyes!" cried Shinnosuke as he pulled his bandanna around his eyes.<p>"What?" The boy beside him staggered back over a few broken stones on the ground and almost fell on his rear.<p>Their guide seemed completely serious once again. "If it looks you in the eyes, you'll die."<p>"Oh. This must be the Basilisk," commented Susan. She seemed to be the calmest of the three.<p>"We've got to get out of here!" Edmund turned to run back towards the door. "No!" The others glanced back away from the slowly awakening serpent for enough time to see what was following just behind them.<p>"The wraiths." The crystals in Shinnosuke's staff flared a little brighter. The creatures were waiting for them just outside the door to the room. They couldn't go back, but it didn't look like the monsters were willing to enter.<p>"Great. One big monster, or a hundred little ones." Susan was not pleased. "This is all your fault Peter!"<p>"Um, it's awake now." Edmund's voice was wavering as he glanced back at his companions.<p>The giant snake hissed angrily. The inside of its mouth was a bright fleshy pink, and two gigantic fangs unfolded from the roof of its mouth. It was easily fifty feet long and appeared to have a nasty temperament.<p>"What do we do?" asked Peter as he looked at the blindfolded leader.<p>"I'll keep him distracted, you find an exit. If we beat the snake, the wraiths will follow us in here."<p>"Where's that elf girl?" muttered Suzan as she glanced around the room as she ran away with Edmund beside her. Both of them turned to find Peter unable to get around the battle. Shinnosuke had given the monster a few good whacks with his staff, and it seemed unwilling to do more that beat on him with its tail. The creature was massive and ripped up chunks of stone as it's coils flailed wildly about. It hissed and kept focused on Shinnosuke, but backed away slowly.<p>Peter had backed away towards the wall and was sliding along a narrow ledge away from the fight as quietly as he could. He was trying to reach the stone ledge so he could take it past the monster to his friends. He felt himself slip as a small chuck of the ledge crumbled under his feet and clattered against the ground. It was easy enough to overstep after he'd regained his balance. A large flat ledge was just above him at the top of his dangerous path. He glanced down at the fight and gasped. Instead of a fight, his eyes fixated on the scales of the gigantic creature.<p>He could hear the beast's breath as he felt the tongue slide along the side of his face. It split apart, with one side moving gently down either cheek. His eyes were squeezed shut as he froze in place. He could hear the moisture of the creature's mouth hitting the ground on the ground below.<p>"Keep your eyes shut!" said a familiar voice from the opposite side of the room. Ranma was perched on top of one of the pillars that had broken near the ceiling above him. She was easily a hundred yards away and haunched low as she drew her bow. The arrow began to glow with a white light as she took aim. Peter was very fortunate his eyes were closed, because it looked like she was aiming at his face.<p>"Oops, that was a little close," she muttered under her breath.<p>The snake hissed as a flash of bright white light blinded it. It twisted violently away from him and landed on the ground. The elven girl appeared out of nowhere and placed her bow across her back as she landed on the falling snake and slid across his coils.<p>"No! Lucy!" cried Susan as Edmund held her back. The monster's coils slammed into the ground where she had been lying. The redheaded girl bounced off the monster's back and landed lightly next to Susan. She pushed a block on the wall in and a twisting stairwell slid down from the ceiling. "Get out of here!" She flashed her a stern looking glare and pushed them towards it.<p>"But Peter!" cried the girl as she looked back towards where the boy was making his way across the upper ledge in the room towards them. "He'll be right behind you! Go!" She turned away and pulled her sword from her back. "That dumbass! Now I've got to save him again."<p>Shinnosuke was fighting a losing battle. He was covered in bruises and welts as he staggered on the stone surface and clenched his weapon a bit tighter. "I won't let you hurt..." The wraiths would not enter the room, but started to reach for him through the doorway behind him. "No!"<p>"You jerk!" The ceiling above shattered and crashed down almost on top of him as the snake's head became buried in a pile of rubble. "Give me that rock!" The girl pulled him away from the doorway as she landed on top of the stones and grabbed his arm to pull him away from the door. The snake was still moving and would soon free itself, but it was having a bit of trouble getting unstuck.<p>Shinnosuke wasn't in much condition to argue and reached into his bag to hand her the glowing blue stone. "I love you."<p>"Stop that! You sick jerk! I'm tryin ta help you!" The girl kicked him in the rear towards the stairs. A low rumble started from behind them and the pair looked up as the foundation of the entire wall over the snake began to shatter away, closing the only visible entrance to the room besides the stairs. It pulled its head free and turned to spit at them angrily as the rushed away. It started moving full speed across the ground towards them.<p>Both of them ran at a full sprint towards the stairs and dashed up into the room above them. Stepped back onto the stairs a bit and launched an arrow at the switch that opened the stairs. She rushed back up as they closed themselves back up and vanished without a trace. A dull thump hit the ground below them, and everything became quiet.<p>"Where are we?" muttered Suzan nervously after a few moments. They stood around gasping for breath mostly. Susan was laid gently across the ground at their feet.<p>"We're in the Lav," said Edmund.<p>A bell rang and bustle began from the hallway outside. A group of about ten girls all talking to each other walked into the room. One by one they all froze at the scene before them.<p>"I'm going to talk to that old wizard and get paid. See you around Shinnosuke." The redhead vanished from sight. It caused another gasp within the group, but only a momentary surprise.<p>"What just happened?" asked Edmund dumbly.<p>"Peter just stood face to face with a Basilisk, and lived." Susan looked rather bewildered and turned her eyes down to her clothes. All of them were a complete mess. "Look at me!"<p>"Yeah. I did, didn't I?" said Peter cheerfully. He looked quite pleased with himself. "I also fought a giant spider!" He seemed quite proud of himself.<p>"You dumbass! Do you realize we could have been killed? What were you thinking?" She promptly slugged him and he fell to the ground out cold.<p>"I thought running away was a good idea!" muttered Edmund fearfully as he put his hands up to defend himself. She glared at him, but stomped through the crowd of dumbstruck girls. Edmund shrugged as Shinnosuke picked up Susan from the ground. "What the heck were we doing down there anyway?" He glanced over his shoulder as he went through the door and decided it probably wasn't that important. Everything seemed to be fine now.<p>With a heavy sigh Edmund went over to the sink to fill his hands with water. He didn't feel like dragging his friend out of there. The girls were starting to look impatient as well.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Here's your stupid rock."<p>"Ah. I thought it might be you. I trust the children are all safe?"<p>"Still not sure what's wrong with that girl. The others are all alive though, nothing is broken."<p>The old man hadn't seen her yet, but the stone was sitting on his desk casting a pale blue glow on everything around it. "So I see. The girl saw the Basilisk's reflection. It was enough to paralyze her. Those are strange creatures indeed. They only eat dead meat, and won't bite anything despite the highly toxic venom they secrete. Thanks to that class you stumbled across earlier, we have a healthy supply of antidote. Fate can be fortuitous at times."<p>"I know what they are," grumbled the hidden girl. The room was rather dark, and well suited to someone who liked to hide in shadows. A small fire in the fireplace was the only light source besides the stone. Stacks of books and shelves filled the room opposite the desk. There were also tables with strange chemistry sets and other assorted objects. "Pay me, so I can leave. I'm sure you understand my impatience."<p>"Yes. Our kind bothers you for some reason."<p>"Only in large numbers," replied the girl coolly. He caught the briefest of glimpses as she moved near the window in the darkness. She was gone just as quickly.<p>"I can see how you got your name, young elf."<p>"Thanks. I kind of like you old man, but I don't trust your friends much."<p>"Shinnosuke will always have a place to stay here. I imagine he will forget about you again in a few days at most. Perhaps the right girl might find him?"<p>"Pay me." It was clear she was getting impatient.<p>"You must travel to the south, with your companions."<p>"Where? Why?"<p>"It won't be an easy journey, you'll have to cross the southern seas to Jusendo, or rather the mountains near it."<p>"Saffron's homeland? What's there?"<p>"In the mountains you will find a cavern, inside an ancient evil is imprisoned. It will give you the knowledge you need to defeat Saffron. First, you must perform a task for him."<p>"A task?" grumbled the girl irritably.<p>"He will give you a challenge, if you pass, then you will begin to understand. This power alone will not destroy Saffron, but it is the first step."<p>"I don't care about Saffron," growled the voice from the shadows.<p>"If you continue down this path, you will find what you want."<p>"I'd better. I won't be happy if I find out I'm being toyed with."<p>"Boy, do you still not understand?" The old man stood up and walked right up to his face. "I can see the dead more clearly than the living. You cannot hide from my eyes boy. It is a rare gift for my kind, try not to look so panicked." He chuckled in a good-natured way at the startled reaction.<p>"What don't I understand?" Ranma dropped her cloak and stood fearlessly in front of him.<p>"We are not toying with you boy. We are relying on you. You are our only hope. Saffron's rise to godhood will not benefit many in this world besides his own people. Many will suffer and die, and a new age of darkness and war will begin."<p>"Sounds good for business."<p>"Is that truly where your heart lies?" he asked her calmly. "I have told you what you need to know. You will find your friends in the mountains west of here. I think you already know the place."<p>"The only thing in those mountains is..." Her eyes went wide and she gasped. "He wouldn't! That asshole!" She glared up at the old man. "Any help getting there will be appreciated."<p>"I was hoping you'd say that."<p>"I'd better not hear anyone talking about this old man."<p>"Do not worry." He walked her over to the fireplace and smiled as he tossed a handful of powder into the flames. Ranma nodded and dove into the green flare up of fire. She vanished in an instant and was gone from the office.<p>Shinnosuke burst into the office just after that. "Is Ranma still here? I've got to tell her that I love her!"<p>"I'm afraid you've just missed her. Perhaps we should have a talk, about the difference between elves and people."<p>"Huh?"<p>"I think I can create a charm that will help you remember these things. It may take a little while though. Why don't you return to bed, and I'll get back to you when I've finished." The old man gently took his shoulder and led him to the door.<p>"Oh. Thanks." He stumbled away scratching his head. "What the heck did I come here for?"<p>The old man closed the door and turned back towards his office with a small smile on his face. "The time of prophecy draws near. Perhaps there is a bit more hope than I once imagined."<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Next time: Pirates of the Southern Seas!
