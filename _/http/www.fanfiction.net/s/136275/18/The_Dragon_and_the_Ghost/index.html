</div>The Dragon and The Ghost<p>Part<p>Herb's Revenge.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>Akane looked up and saw a familiar figure standing over her. Even<br/>in the minimal light she could make out the red tint to the elf's<br/>hair. "Heh, what do you want?"<p>"You can go now," said Ranma as she removed the chains from her<br/>arms and legs and stepped back.<p>Akane froze, and stared at her for a moment wordlessly. "What?"<p>"There's no point in keeping you any longer, I can get to what I<br/>need because Herb has conquered the entire country. Killing you too<br/>keep the secret of who has the Kajakan is pointless, and by the time<br/>you tell anyone where this place is, we'll be long gone."<p>"What of the Kajakan?" said Akane coldly as she glared at him.<p>"It's no concern of mine anymore," said the elf with a shrug. She<br/>sat down across from her and smirked. "The old woman paid us, and now<br/>we're leaving."<p>"So, you're just going to let me go?" said the knight with a dead<br/>calm in her voice.<p>"That's right. How you escape is your own business," replied Ranma<br/>as she stood up. "See ya." She walked out of her cell and left the<br/>door open.<p>Akane stood up slowly, and walked out after he had rounded the<br/>corner. She flexed her fists for a moment with a confused looking<br/>frown on her face. "Now what?" The problem was, she didn't have an<br/>answer. Returning home was suicide, and she had no desire to live the<br/>rest of her life as a fugitive. "Damn it."<p>++++++++++<p>Ranma paused as she entered a small room just outside the prison.<br/>She smiled and turned to face the figure hidden in the shadows behind<br/>him. "What is it?"<p>"What do you think you're doing?" said Mousse as he faded out of<br/>the shadows.<p>"She's my prisoner, I'll do what I like with her," snorted the elf<br/>as she continued walking.<p>Mousse was in front of her in an instant, Ranma paused, her face<br/>as calm as ever. "Is there something wrong?"<p>"She's going to lead them right too us," said the elf boy angrily.<p>"You aren't really dumb enough to stay holed up in here are you?"<br/>said Ranma with a small chuckle. "You won't live another week if you<br/>try that."<p>Mousse growled and stepped back slightly.<p>"You know I'm right, these aren't dwarven tunnels," said Ranma as<br/>she glanced around at the walls surrounding them for a moment.<p>"They were," said Mousse carefully.<p>"Maybe originally, but I recognize some of the work on the<br/>supports. Only drow are this articulate when building supports.<br/>Dwarves wouldn't carve runes on these posts." Ranma ran her hand along<br/>the surface of one of the wooden planks that supported the walls and<br/>tunnels.<p>Mousse frowned and growled. "What would you know?"<p>"Don't worry about it dark boy, if you keep my secret, I'll keep<br/>yours," said Ranma coldly as he stared the boy down for a moment.<p>"What?" muttered Mousse as he staggered back away from the girl.<p>"Playing blind to keep the suspicious away? A good way too hide<br/>your sensitive eyes under those thick glasses. Plus the added bonus of<br/>an excuse for not being able to see well in the light." Ranma turned<br/>the corner and left him standing there. "I suggest you let her pass<br/>you without any resistance," she said as she vanished from view.<p>"You! Come back here!" roared Mousse as he pulled a sword from his<br/>robes and dashed around the corner after her. When he got there, he<br/>saw nothing. His entire body was shaking as he stood alone in the<br/>hall. He dropped the sword and let it clatter to the ground noisily,<br/>grasping the sides of his head as he fell too his knees. "Shampoo..."<br/>If she ever found out about his secret, there was no way he could ever<br/>find a way into her heart.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"So. You are leaving?" asked Cologne from her throne. Shampoo<br/>stood at her side silently. The young elf girl stood before her again<br/>smirking confidently as she accepted her reward.<p>"That's right," said Ranma calmly. "We've got no reason to stay. I<br/>thank you for your hospitality."<p>"You have our thanks, please do not return," said the old woman.<p>"I've got no plans to return to this mud-hole," snorted Ryoga. He was<br/>cheerful though, and had a large bag of money attached to his belt.<p>Ukyo and Ryu were silent, and stood off to the side of the room<br/>side by side.<p>"Well, I won't see you again then," said Ranma as she gave a low<br/>bow.<p>Shampoo's face was neutral as she stood silently beside her Great<br/>Grandmother. She didn't say a single word, for fear of bursting into<br/>tears.<p>"Come on, let's get out of here," said Ranma as she turned away<br/>from the old woman.<p>"Before something else happens," agreed Ryu calmly.<p>Ukyo took a sympathetic glance towards Shampoo, and followed after<br/>the others.<p>Up on the throne, Cologne turned towards her Great Granddaughter<br/>for a moment. "Child, push him from your mind."<p>"I don't know why, but I fell for her," replied the young girl<br/>quietly.<p>"It is best not to think of it. I know it is hard, but you must<br/>think of your station as well."<p>"She is of noble blood," replied Shampoo calmly.<p>"Yes child, that may be, but she is a thief, and one who is well<br/>known throughout the entire world. It is not something I'll wager she<br/>can simply push away, nor do I imagine she wishes too."<p>"I know, but still," muttered Shampoo quietly. A single tear ran<br/>down her cheek.<p>"That is enough. Our people must have an heir, you are not as free<br/>to choose your mate as other elves. I am sorry," snapped Cologne with<br/>finality in her voice.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Just as the group of travelers was about to exit the room, the<br/>doors burst open, and one of the guards rushed into the chamber.<br/>"Elder!"<p>Cologne stood up suddenly and stared at him. "What is it?"<p>"They have found us!"<p>"How?" snapped Cologne angrily. "There is no way we should have<br/>been discovered so soon!"<p>Two more men brought another one of the elders into the room. They<br/>were carrying her gently by her arms, and placed her on the ground<br/>before Cologne. She could barely stand. "I failed us."<p>"What? Speak!" cried Cologne angrily.<p>"A young sorceress, more powerful than I, managed to overwhelm my<br/>will. She broke the seal, and allowed her magic to detect us. We have<br/>but an hour to prepare at most."<p>"Damn! Gather everyone together, we must escape!" said Cologne<br/>forcefully as she jumped down from the throne and thrust the Kajakan<br/>at Shampoo.<p>++++++++++++<p>"Let's go," said Ranma as she turned away from the scene and<br/>continued to walk through the doors.<p>"What? We can't just let them die!" cried Ukyo.<p>"We'll die with them if we stay," said Ryu coldly.<p>Ukyo backed away in horror.<p>"Knight, I hate to say this, but they are right. We can't fight,"<br/>agreed Ryoga calmly. "This battle belongs too the elves alone. If we<br/>stay, we'll just die here."<p>"It doesn't look like they plan to fight to me," commented Ranma<br/>as she glanced over her shoulder for a moment. "They're going to run."<p>"If what that guard says is true, we're going to have a hard<br/>enough time escaping on our own. Herb will have all the exits<br/>covered." said Ryu.<p>"So how do we escape?" asked Ukyo as she seemed to finally<br/>understand the situation.<p>"Easy, we take the most obvious route," said Ranma.<p>"The main entrance?" said Ryoga dumbly.<p>"No, Herb will come in to invade that way," said Ryu calmly. "I<br/>think I get it though. We'll leave through this secondary exit. Herb<br/>will not send many to guard that exit. He will assume that the elves<br/>will use the smaller escape tunnels and secret exits. He's probably<br/>right too."<p>"Thief wait!" said an aged voice from behind the group.<p>They turned to see Cologne standing behind them with Shampoo at<br/>her side. She tossed a small bag of money too the redhead. "Take this,<br/>and take Shampoo with you."<p>Ranma blinked and looked at the woman in shock. "Huh?"<p>"There is no time for debate. Simply do as I say," snapped Cologne<br/>as she bounced away.<p>"Hey! Wait a minute!" cried Ranma as she started after her.<p>Shampoo merely frowned at her and stood in her way, a familiar<br/>bundle in her arms.<p>"Oh shit," said Ranma as she realized what it was. "Hell no! I am<br/>not taking that damn thing again!"<p>"If Herb recovers the Kajakan, there is no hope for the future,"<br/>said Shampoo calmly.<p>"Bloody hell," muttered Ryu angrily.<p>"How far away is this exit?" said Ranma with a small sigh as she<br/>turned towards Ryu.<p>"Huh? I thought you knew where it was," said the boy dumbly.<p>The entire group looked at each other, one at a time. "You mean,<br/>none of us knows the way out of here?" said Ranma as she hung her<br/>head.<p>"So, you do need me after all?" said Shampoo as she smirked and<br/>strolled past them. "Which exit did you want to take?"<p>"Shampoo!" called Mousse as he rushed up to the group waving his<br/>arms frantically.<p>"Mousse?" said the girl in shock. "What are you doing here? Get<br/>back with the others!"<p>The boy grinned dumbly and bowed too her. "I can't! I won't leave<br/>you alone with these evil people!"<p>Ranma sat down and hung her head. This was the last thing she<br/>needed. "Go away dark boy."<p>Mousse became very serious. "I will not. No matter what you say."<p>"I command you to go back," said Shampoo angrily as she pointed<br/>down the hall.<p>"The doors have been sealed. I can't go back," said Mousse calmly.<br/>"I'm coming with you my love! At last we can be together!"<p>Ranma decked Mousse as he latched onto her for no apparent reason.<br/>"What the hell are you doing?"<p>"He's a blind idiot, that's what," snorted Shampoo. "He says he<br/>loves me, but he can't tell me from a potted plant half the time."<p>"There's no need to get..." started Ukyo.<p>"I'm not exaggerating," said Shampoo as she cut her off.<p>"I hate to break up this little party, but there's an angry dragon<br/>man coming this way with an army of soldiers," said Ryu as he stood up<br/>and started walking.<p>"We can sort this mess out later," agreed Ranma.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Herb stood outside the entrance to the caverns with an evil smirk<br/>on his face. "Really Nabiki, you've outdone yourself this time." He<br/>was speaking to a floating ball of crystal, with Nabiki's image<br/>looking back at him.<p>"Ha! That old bat was too weak and frail too hold me off!"<p>"Indeed, we shall celebrate our victory when I return," said Herb<br/>as he glared at her for a moment.<p>"Oh! I can't wait!" exclaimed Nabiki with a small wink. Her image<br/>faded away and the crystal floated down to Herb's waiting palm.<p>"You have the exits covered?" said the dragon-man as he turned<br/>towards one of his subordinates.<p>"Sir!" said the man with an affirmative nod.<p>"Excellent. Begin the extraction. I want every elf inside this<br/>rotting hole dead."<p>++++++++++++<p>"Um, you know where we are, right?" said Ranma as she glanced at<br/>Shampoo nervously.<p>"This way," said the girl as she touched a wall and stepped back.<br/>It slid open, revealing a door.<p>"If they were strong enough to get past that old elf, I'm betting<br/>they were able to get a map of this place," commented Ryu.<p>"Using secret passages won't work to our advantage," agreed Ranma.<p>"It's not a secret door, this is a supply dump. It was just built<br/>this way to make it look more natural in the tunnels," said the elf as<br/>she stepped through.<p>"So we're leaving through the service exit?" muttered Ukyo.<p>"That's right," said Mousse calmly.<p>"Whatever, let's just get out of here," said Ryoga irritably.<p>"What's that sound?" said Ranma as she cocked her head and turned<br/>her gaze into the dark hallway. "Sounds like...yelling?"<p>The group paused as Akane Tendo ran towards them in a full sprint,<br/>she was letting out what sounded like a battle cry as she went and<br/>suddenly stopped about ten meters in front of them.<p>"What the?" muttered Ryu. He turned to look at his partner. "What<br/>the hell is she doing out of her cage?"<p>"I let her go, we had no reason to hold her," said Ranma with a<br/>small shrug.<p>"You!" snapped the knight angrily as she glared at them. "I'd<br/>rather die!" she muttered as she glanced back down the hallway. She<br/>seemed to consider something for a moment and cursed under her breath<br/>as she jogged towards them. "Wherever the hell you're going, start<br/>running now."<p>"What?" said Ukyo as she started to bar the girl's way, she<br/>quickly reconsidered when she heard a rumbling from the passage where<br/>the girl had come from. "Ranchan... here they come!"<p>"Move!" cried Ryu as he grabbed Ryoga by his collar and pulled him<br/>into the doorway.<p>Ranma caught a flash of light from the torches the men were<br/>carrying and then stepped inside the passage Shampoo had opened. The<br/>door closed behind them, just as the army was about to round the<br/>corner.<p>"Come on! This way!" whispered Shampoo as she waved them into an<br/>upward moving tunnel.<p>Mousse suddenly stopped and looked down at his feet for a moment.<br/>He had managed to step into a rather fresh looking pile of green<br/>slime. "Shampoo, we did clear away the sandwyrms, right?"<p>The girl paused and looked at him dumbly for a moment. "What are<br/>sandwyrms?"<p>The elf boy choked for a moment and pressed his back against the<br/>wall in terror. The three girls stood dumbly as all the men<br/>immediately followed his example.<p>"What are you idiots doing?" asked Shampoo as she started to walk<br/>towards them.<p>Ranma put up his finger and she stopped in surprise. "Don't move,"<br/>he almost yelled. "Just stand there for a minute all right? All of<br/>you."<p>"What's going on?" muttered Ukyo.<p>"Sandwyrms?" muttered Akane in confusion, she seemed to remember<br/>something, and jumped back, pressing herself against the wall as well.<br/>"These tunnels are Drow?"<p>"Yes, they killed the dwarves and attacked us a long time ago.<br/>They were living under us in secret for almost two years," said<br/>Shampoo. "That was almost two hundred years ago. No one ever comes<br/>down here anymore."<p>"Bloody hell, hungry sandwyrms at that," muttered Ryu angrily.<br/>"Ranma, we can't just stand here."<p>"I'm thinking damn it! Everybody just stand against the wall and<br/>don't move," snapped the redhead. She could escape easily, but the<br/>others were in serious trouble. "Blind boy, got any ideas?"<p>"These things only respond too their master," said Mousse<br/>nervously.<p>"What the hell is a sandwyrm?" asked Ukyo as she glared at Ranma<br/>irritably.<p>"Think a hundred foot drow watchdog, and you've got the basic<br/>idea," muttered the redhead fearfully. Most drow live in deep forests,<br/>but occasionally they use underground tunnels as well. They keep these<br/>things as pets when they do, and they guard their territory very<br/>lethally."<p>"So, where is this thing?" said Ukyo as she looked around.<p>"It's in the sand along the ground," said Ranma as she pointed<br/>down at her feet.<p>"We haven't woken it up yet," agreed Ryu. "They can't hear or see,<br/>but they can feel vibrations in the sand from things like people<br/>walking on it."<p>"Can they smell us?" asked Shampoo nervously.<p>"Only if it's awake," said Ryoga. "I've killed beasts like this<br/>before, and it isn't pleasant. They are a plague to the southern<br/>mines."<p>"So? What do we do?" muttered Ukyo.<p>We move very carefully along the wall, drag your feet slowly and<br/>follow me. Stand on the wall if you can, we don't want this thing<br/>waking up," said Ranma as she started to move along the wall.<p>"That's an understatement," grumbled Ryoga as he rolled his eyes<br/>and followed.<p>They all shifted slowly towards the exit of the tunnel, a point of<br/>light far in the distance above them. "This could take a while. Let's<br/>hope they don't decide to send reinforcements this way." commented<br/>Ryu.<p>"Shit," muttered Ranma as she paused and noticed several men<br/>moving towards them with torches in their grasps.<p>"Oh great," agreed Ryu.<p>The men were jogging merrily along, their armor clanking as they<br/>moved down the tunnel. There were about six of them, all dressed in<br/>black armor with broadswords by their sides.<p>Akane turned her head and saw a disturbance in the sand a few<br/>yards behind them. "Um...we should run now."<p>A massive head slowly began to rise from the floor, it was about<br/>four feet high and three feet wide. It looked like a gigantic dog<br/>head, with no eyes or ears. It curled its lips back and snarled as it<br/>sniffed the air in front of it for a moment. Finally, it let loose a<br/>massive bark and shot forward like a bullet.<p>The group was running towards the soldiers carelessly now, what<br/>was behind them far more lethal than a few unaware men could be.<p>"Shiiiiitttt!" cried Ryu as he rushed by the men, shoving them<br/>aside carelessly as he led the party through them.<p>The men stood there dumbly for a moment and blinked as the<br/>adventurers passed them.<p>"Who the hell?" it was the man's last words as the jaws of the<br/>sandwyrm snapped down on him and dragged him beneath the sand. He<br/>didn't even get the chance too scream. The other men backed away in<br/>horror, not noticing the new disturbance in the sand behind them.<br/>There were two of them this time, on heading towards them, and the<br/>other following behind the desperately running party.<p>Ranma glanced back for a moment and began to push herself a bit<br/>harder. "There's nothing left of our guests, and we've got two more<br/>behind us."<p>"More?" gasped Ukyo as she spun around and leveled her spear at<br/>the things. "Take this!" she snarled as she blasted a bolt of light<br/>into the ground. It exploded on the surface and sent a few chunks of<br/>stone flying around, but did nothing to stop them.<p>"Quit fooling around and run!" cried Ranma.<p>"The exit!" cried Ryu as he pointed forward at the cave entrance.<p>"Go! Go! Go!" cried Ranma as she pushed Shampoo ahead of her and<br/>shoved everyone outside just as the beast's heads burst from the<br/>ground.<p>Two long necks lashed out of the cavern, snapping at them angrily<br/>like angry eels. They quickly retreated back into the darkness and<br/>left the group panting on the ground outside.<p>"Son of a bitch!" cried Ranma in shock as she jumped up to her<br/>feet. "Man that was clos..." She froze and looked around for a moment.<br/>"Damn it."<p>Akane slowly rose to her feet and saw what the boy was talking<br/>about. The rest of the party was already standing perfectly still, as<br/>a huge group of black knights, almost fifty men, closed the ring<br/>around them. "So, this is how it ends?"<p>"Akane?" said a familiar voice over the silent crowd of armor clad<br/>soldiers.<p>"It's lady Akane!" cried another one of the knights. The rest of<br/>them let out a victorious cheer. "Summon Lord Tendo at once!"<p>"Friends of yours?" asked Ryu quietly.<p>"These are my knights," replied the girl with a vicious looking<br/>smirk on her face. "What are you all doing here?" she called to one of<br/>the nearby men.<p>"We are under the command of Lord Tendo," said one of the men as<br/>he put his fist up over his heart in a salute.<p>Akane did the same and calmly walked forward as a man in black<br/>armor, without a helmet rode forward on a gigantic black war-horse.<p>"My daughter, you are safe," said Soun as he looked down at the<br/>girl. He jumped down off of his horse and grabbed her into a rough<br/>hug. "Wahhhh! My baby has come home safely!"<p>Akane blushed and stared forward dumbly. "Daaaadd! Not in front of<br/>the men!"<p>"Oh! Right," said the man as he pulled her away from his chest and<br/>turned to look at the group for a moment. "These ruffians, have them<br/>killed at once!"<p>"Sir!" snapped one of the men as he turned to face the soldiers<br/>who still formed a ring around Ranma and her party.<p>The pigtailed girl and the others prepared for a fight.<p>"Wait!" said Akane as she stood in front of her father for a<br/>moment. She walked up to Shampoo and took the bundle from her arms,<br/>forcefully as the girl gave a small amount of resistance. She<br/>unwrapped it and held it high in the air. "I have recovered the<br/>Kajakan for the Emperor. These brave souls made that possible."<p>Ryu looked at her in shock, while the elves and Ukyo gave her<br/>hateful glares. Ryoga looked pretty indifferent, and spit on the<br/>ground roughly, not bothering to put his axe back onto his back again.<br/>Ranma, had not yet moved.<p>"So, they are too be rewarded?" said Soun as he looked the group<br/>up and down for a moment.<p>"I have already collected my reward," said Ranma coldly as she<br/>stared at the man, her gaze locked onto him. Every muscle in her body<br/>was tense.<p>"I see," said Soun as he nodded to the men. They replaced their<br/>weapons and dispersed.<p>"Thief, if I see you again. I will kill you, any debt I had to you<br/>has been paid now," said Akane as she turned back to Ranma again.<br/>"When we meet again, we are enemies."<p>Ranma merely nodded. "I know, and we will meet again."<p>Akane turned up her nose and walked away from them. "Somebody get<br/>me a decent set of armor!" She called into the rows of soldiers.<br/>"Where are we camped?"<p>Ranma turned back and saw the others staring at her. "Ryu, I've<br/>found him," said the redhead as she started walking away.<p>"What? Are you sure?" stammered the boy as he rushed to follow.<p>"I'd know that voice anywhere. I've heard it in my dreams for the<br/>last ten years of my life."<p>"What is she talking about?" asked Shampoo as she rushed to follow<br/>with Ukyo and Mousse just behind her.<p>Ryoga merely watched them go, a smirk forming on his face as they<br/>disappeared from view. "Well, it seems I've finally been paid. I'll<br/>see you around, Ranma." He turned away and walked off in a random<br/>direction.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: The Betrayal.<p>
