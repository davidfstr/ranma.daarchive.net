</div>The Dragon and the Ghost.<p>Part 19<p>The Betrayal.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranma simply remained where he was for a long moment after Akane rode off proudly. The armored men cheered victoriously around her. They would not have to hide her from the Emperor. She had foiled the fabled Dragon Ghost and returned the staff to the Empire's hands. Their ranks would celebrate that evening and probably for a few weeks after they returned home.<p>"Ranma, we can't stay here," said Ryuu impatiently as he leaned against the wall.<p>"They're going to throw a party on me," said Ranma calmly. "She thinks she's going to celebrate her victory. That ungrateful bitch!" He stomped his foot on the ground and twisted his heel into the dirt angrily. "Oooh! Just wait!"<p>"Ranma?" muttered Ryuu dumbly as he stood up from his spot on the wall and stared at him. After the revelation he'd just gotten, he figured this was the farthest thing from the boy's mind at the moment.<p>Shampoo and Mousse simply stepped back. The elf girl looked perplexed, and Mousse was simply moving back to be clear of any angry tantrum debris.<p>"I'm going after her," said the boy as he glanced back at Ryuu.<p>"What?" muttered the boy as he stared at him in disbelief.<p>Ranma turned his head towards the road they had taken. "I'm going alone."<p>"What?" growled Ryuu angrily. "Your name isn't the only one at stake here!"<p>Ranma simply turned away from him. "There's also that other matter."<p>Ryuu obviously didn't like what he was hearing. "So?"<p>"Ryuu."<p>"We've both been paid. We were hired to get her and that staff somewhere safe. You know where we can take them."<p>"Yeah," said Ranma as he glanced back at him for a moment. "I know where it'll be safe."<p>"I'll take her and her boyfriend there."<p>Ranma smirked and nodded. "Right. Dump her boyfriend off before you pass the point. She's the only one we were hired to take there. I don't want to deal with that much heat right now."<p>Shampoo looked more than a little irritated, while Mousse looked quite pleased with the idea. "He's not my boyfriend!"<p>Ryuu nodded at Ranma and scratched the back of his head as they continued to ignore her presence. "Well, I can only get us so far."<p>"You'll just have to hang around and wait then," replied Ranma with a small shrug. "This shouldn't take too long."<p>"Then I'm going with you," replied Ukyo.<p>Ranma merely raised his hand to stop her. "You're a well known soldier in a neighboring army."<p>The girl stopped cold and worked her jaw up and down. "But..."<p>"I'm not dealing with that kind of mess. I've been blamed for all sorts of messes before, and I don't want this one. You go with him."<p>Ryuu shrugged his shoulders calmly. "He's my partner, he'll come back... I think."<p>Ranma merely started walking.<p>No one moved to follow him, but Ukyo raised her hand slightly as if she wanted to say something. "Uhhhh."<p>He didn't here her and kept moving.<p>"Come back safe..." she whispered to herself halfheartedly as she turned towards the rest of the group.<p>Ryuu grumbled to himself and crossed his arms. "Why do I always get stuck sneaking around with the mob? He's the one who likes other people."<p>"Who are you calling a mob?" grumbled Mousse irritably.<p>"Shit," muttered Ryuu. "Come on, we got a lot of walkin ta do."<p>"Great," sighed Shampoo. It would have been nice to stay home a bit longer after the last trip she had taken. Boy, had that ever sucked. Getting a little of her natural essence back from being in nature had been nice and all, but the amount of near death experiences she'd had was quite disturbing. She knew herself to be a strong warrior, but this was a little much for a noble elf. She could beat any man one on one, or even a good sized group of the soldiers in the palace, but being chased by an army of goblins was quite a bit different. She had a funny feeling she was in for more of the same this time around.<p>Mousse smirked as he walked up beside her with both his eyes closed as he strolled up to her side. "You're the one who always wanted an adventure. Don't start looking down now that you've finally gotten your wish."<p>Shampoo glared at him irritably. "It was fun until you came along."<p>Mousse burst into tears and fell on his knees in front of her in a pleading posture. "Don't say that Shampoo! I will do anything to maximize the amount of fun to be had for you!"<p>Ryuu slammed his fist into the tree next to him and it creaked loudly to the ground. It wasn't a very large tree, only about a foot around and ten feet tall. He wiped his chin with the back of his hand and glanced around, now certain he had everyone's attention. "That's enough. Need I remind anyone else that we are in the middle of the Empire's army? So if you don't mind, I'd like to start walking." He turned and started a slow steady pace down the opposite road that Ranma had taken. "He's the sneaky one, I'm the one who su...isn't as good at that stuff. So I get to take large groups of people where I really need all the stealth I can muster just to keep my own ass alive."<p>"Where are we going?" grumbled Mousse.<p>"It's a secret," replied Ryuu stonily from the front of the group. Everyone had quickly followed his example and trailed in a loose group behind him. Ukyo and Shampoo were scanning the tree line on either side of Mousse.<p>"Great," grumbled the elf as he pushed his glasses up his nose.<p>"Mousse, quit complaining and watch the rear," replied Ryuu as he picked up the pace a little.<p>The elf growled under his breath and moved back from between the two girls.<p>"Are you kidding? Mousse can't see anything that's more than an inch away from his face."<p>Ryuu continued walking calmly. "He can see fine for what he needs to do. Those eyes of his are super sensitive, he can't see much clearly right now, but anything that moves he'll spot long before we do."<p>"What?" muttered Shampoo as she turned to look at him.<p>He continued walking backwards, keeping himself from stumbling by the sounds of their footfalls behind him. "It's just the medical term for why I can't see well. He's right, how do you think I managed to get a job at the palace as a guard? I wasn't born into it you know, you still have to earn the right to serve."<p>"What do you mean you weren't born into it? You've been annoying me since we were children!"<p>Ryuu chuckled at this. "Oh, I get it. You still don't understand? I thought you were an elf noble or something?"<p>"Elven," replied Mousse. "She is the ruler of a group of us."<p>"Where do you get off correctin me?" replied Ryuu calmly.<p>"Mousse is right, and stop fighting," snapped Shampoo.<p>"Way I figure it, they figured out what was wrong with his eyes, and knew what it could mean for them if he was trained as a guard. So they started training him right away, and put him the important position of guarding you. See, he can see stuff we usually don't notice, but he can't really focus his eyes on anything in particular. At least, not right now."<p>Mousse looked infuriated, but no one could see the look on his face. He remained silent as they walked on behind him.<p>Shampoo looked slightly impressed, but also like she had no idea what half of what he said meant. "You're some kind of doctor?"<p>Ryuu snorted slightly at this. "In my profession, sometimes you run across some interesting writings, books, and scrolls while on the job. Not all of them are sealed with magic either. There were several interesting ones concerning the Drow, and how they were different from elves physically. It was pretty interesting stuff, and it really opened my eyes about how many of them there really are. Hell, we had a wizard once who just used us to send a letter to another wizard. We never mess with anything made by those two loons anymore, but anyway, that's why thieves make such good informants and spies. It also makes it easier to talk your way out of things when someone gets suspicious. Stupid thieves never last long, but ones that look stupid are often the most dangerous." He glanced back at her as she backed away slightly. "I've teased him enough for now," thought Ryuu to himself. "He'll remember that I've got him on a short leash if I need him too."<p>Ukyo walked up to his side and glanced back at Shampoo. The girl had noticed but didn't say anything.<p>The knight knew trying to lower her voice so the other two couldn't hear her was pointless, so she just spit out her question. "What's with you?"<p>"Nuthin, drop it."<p>"No. Why are you trying to egg him on, and what about?"<p>"It's none of your business," replied Ryuu coolly as he picked up his pace enough to move ahead of her stride.<p>"Stop talking to him. Every time we annoy him he makes us go faster," said Shampoo.<p>"A brisk march is too much for you?"<p>"Don't be foolish, it's pointless to exert more energy than you need," replied the elf calmly. "It wouldn't do for us to keep pushing him and end up fighting already winded."<p>Ukyo sighed and hung her shoulders as she continued onward.<p>+++++++++++++<p>"They have it!" hissed Nabiki Tendo as she frowned back at Herb. They were standing in the middle of a large tent, there were cushions and pillows around the edge of the tent, and a crystal ball floated in front of her.<p>"Who?" replied the man calmly as he noticed the concentration on her face.<p>"The thief has brought the staff too us!"<p>"Are you certain?" asked Herb as he nodded slowly. The faintest hint of a dark smile had formed on his face.<p>"Yes, the spirit must deliver it to you, he must give it too you. My sister brings it too us now with my father. Exactly as I had foreseen!"<p>"Indeed," replied Herb as he smirked at her for a moment.<p>"The prophecy unfolds before us! The time is now!" She paused when she noticed Herb walking away behind her. "Where are you going?" her lip was turned in a knowing smirk as she glanced back at him.<p>"I'm going to get my staff."<p>Nabiki turned towards her crystal and whispered quietly into it at the image of Herb. "Yes my love, go and secure my destiny!" She reared her head back and laughed coldly at the image in front of her. Soon, she could secure her destiny as High Priestess under Lord Saffron, god over the land she now stood upon. Everything would then be within her grasp. She had the knowledge of what she'd need and when the next opportunity to become a god would occur. When that happened, the secrets of absolute power would be opened up to her and her dark sight. If her plan succeeded she would become a god of gods. She looked at the crystal and watched Herb transform into a dragon. "Of course, there is always the chance, that I will not have to wait for Saffron to ascend first." She giggled and stared into the crystal deeply as he lifted off the ground and sailed into the air.<p>Ranma pulled her head out of the small spring she had found down their path. The men had to tear down camp and had deliberately set up next to the spring. Getting to it was no problem for her and she faded back into the shadows. She paused for a moment and looked at the edge of the spring. She realized that taking down the camp wouldn't take long, but she had a bit of waiting to do. While she could just take the staff now, she wanted to get lord Tendo alone, or with his bitch of a daughter. He wouldn't mind that much either. She'd probably follow him around until he killed her either way. Besides, he wanted to know what she'd do if she knew what kind of man her father really was. Would she even care at all?<p>Still, they would pretty much walk out of the forest celebrating amongst themselves as they rode, then they'd hit the open plains and it would make following them a little more difficult. It would probably take them a day or two to deliver it to whoever was in charge of the mess. Since Lord Herb was involved they'd take it directly to the Emperor.<p>Ranma smirked as she reached out and plucked the leaves off a small plant that was growing on some of the rocks around the spring. Being a girl made it a bit easier to use because of her magic. The plant was only found in the mountainous areas of the continent, and even then it was rare and only grew in this part of the year. She'd learned about it from those two loony wizards; they were very powerful, but a bit weird. After she'd delivered their letter, which turned out to be nothing more than a single word, 'Hello,' they'd given her a couple of scrolls. All the plants on the scrolls were safe to eat, but it listed anything that wouldn't kill you, and what it did too you. It had made surviving in the wild infinitely easier, and she'd shared the knowledge with Ryuu. The both of them could live in the desert for years if they felt like it. It'd have to be some pretty heavy stuff to cause them to vanish that way though. The two old men were amusing if nothing else, they seemed to just play with everything around them, but it was mostly harmless, and often served a greater purpose.<p>She settled down in the branch of a tree that hid her from the soldiers below under a dark canopy that allowed her to see them quite clearly. She smirked as she used a fire spell to light the cigarette she'd rolled out of the leaves and relaxed. She'd actually changed into an elf because he could use the extra senses to keep a safer distance away from them when they hit open ground. If he didn't get the staff by then, he would have to wait until their first camp and steal it then, and worry about the Tendo clan later.<p>She puffed out smoke as she waited and watched the scene below. She had enough for a few more of them, but she figured she'd save a couple for Ryuu when she found him again. All the serious wizards frowned on its use, while the more playful ones were usually more powerful, and granted more power by the gods because of some of the stuff they did with the locals. Ranma didn't understand that much at all. Apparently the gods seemed to like people who used it. He needed only to look at himself and Ryuu to realize that. Maybe it had something to do with an unfair advantage? Even the dark ones seemed to get stronger under the influence. Most of the Goblin Lords he'd met had a longer fatter version of what he had burning between their lips at all times. The more creative black wizards often had boxes of cigar sized versions.<p>It did have a down side though. She wasn't empowered at the moment. Following the mob that would form for a short time before Tendo would command them into ranks would be easy. Then they'd lazily trot their way out of the woods, still screaming like idiots with joy. For them, this was an important victory on more than one level. Ranma kind of felt bad that she had to ruin it for them. After she'd passed, a few of the knights had taken notice of the plant as well. They weren't using them right now though, and would have to wait until the next camp and sneak away, probably in small groups. When work was slow, hiring himself and Ryuu out as mercenaries was a good way to make a bit of travel money. They rarely had to fight in more than a few battles in one small area before they got paid and were sent on their way. They'd even joined mobs hired to find themselves for a good laugh sometimes. That hadn't happened in a while though.<p>She grunted as she sat up and put the small butt out on the tree stump and pocketed it. Squatting on the branch she peered into the camp and realized that they were starting to straddle their horses. Tendo and Akane stood overlooking the camp the whole time, but they were always surrounded by soldiers. They now sat atop their horses and Akane had on a spare set of armor. It was little more than a chest plate, shoulder pads, knee guards, and a helmet. She also had a good-sized broadsword in her grip as well. It was polished silver, she looked down the blade carefully and put it away as she watched the men mount up.<p>Tendo had the covered staff held like an upright spear. He waved his free arm and started riding, the men followed.<p>Ranma giggled as she bounded over them from branch to branch.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane rode along side her father as they strode proudly through the forest around them. She had her head held high and a smirk on her face as she rode.<p>"How did you come through all of this?" asked her father casually.<p>"It is a long story, it is as my sister said. The Dragon Ghost was involved."<p>"I see, the Emperor will be pleased to hear that, it will impact how the people will see the incident. Especially since he has never been foiled."<p>"As you say," replied Akane. "Where is Lord Herb?"<p>"We go to him now," replied Soun.<p>"No. Lord Herb is a traitor. I heard it from his own mouth. We take the staff to the Emperor himself, and no one else."<p>Her father nodded firmly at this. The men behind him had gone silent.<p>Akane stared forward and jerked her head slightly to the right. "I heard something."<p>"What?" said her father seriously.<p>"In the woods, to our right," replied the girl.<p>"Men?"<p>Akane thought about it. "I don't think so. Sounded more like something big hitting the ground. A wounded animal?"<p>"It is possible, there are wolves in these woods."<p>"I'll go check on it, it might not be too bad. Maybe we'll have something for the fire tonight."<p>Her father nodded and continued to ride as she moved off into the woods. Akane just simply stared at the sight in front of her. Ranma was lying on her back with a painful looking frown on her face.<p>"Ouch."<p>"What are you doing here?" asked Akane as she pointed her sword at her.<p>"Falling out of the trees," replied Ranma cheerfully. She sat up and brushed a few leaves out of her hair.<p>"Stop posing, you followed us," snarled Akane.<p>Ranma merely stared at her with a goofy looking grin on her face. "That's obvious isn't it?"<p>"Why? Did you come to steal the staff again? Humiliate me a second time? Have you no honor at all?"<p>"Why do ya think I've got to take it back?" replied Ranma as she stood up. Her face was calm now and she stared the girl in front of her down. "Jeez, you didn't think it would be this easy did you?"<p>"You owe me," snarled Akane.<p>"And you owe me," replied Ranma calmly.<p>"The hell I do! It was all your fault I was in that mess to begin with!"<p>"I guess you've got a point there, but that doesn't change things. I've got to take that staff back. Sorry."<p>Akane snorted and thrust her sword forward. Ranma merely shifted aside and she stabbed it deeply into the tree behind her. She looked her directly in the face.<p>"That's not the only reason I'm here."<p>She gasped and staggered back falling on her rear. "What?"<p>"I'm here to kill your father."<p>Akane's eyes went wide, she was standing in front of her sword and she was in no position to fight. She was also standing over her and forced her to stare up to look at her.<p>"Do you know why?" asked the elf as she narrowed her eyes at her.<p>"I have a good idea. The noose getting a little to tight?"<p>"Heh. Don't be absurd. I'm here to avenge my father."<p>"Was he as much of a scoundrel as you are?" growled Akane as she searched for a way out of her situation. She knew the girl in front of her was much stronger and faster than she was. She'd been planning on changing that before they met again and then hunt her down. "I only let you go because I wanted to give you a head start. I figured I owed you that much for showing me what a bitch my sister really was."<p>"I'll not argue with that, but no, my father was his best friend, in fact, I looked it up while I was sitting around waiting for you to pull up camp." She held a small crystal in her hand. "You'd be surprised how easy it is to do once you have a few names and how they relate to you. We're engaged."<p>The girl stared up at him dumbly. "What?"<p>"I am the son of Lord Genma Saotome, my father is the man who your clan betrayed in order to avoid Saffron's cleansing of the Nobles ten years ago."<p>"Liar!" snarled Akane as she jumped to her feet. Ranma had the sword she had lost in his grip as he stepped back and let her rise to her feet. "My father is an honorable man!"<p>"Maybe he was, once," replied Ranma calmly.<p>Akane stepped back away from him. "I owed you a favor, but you've used it up."<p>"You can't kill me," replied Ranma as she smirked at Akane. "I'm too good for that."<p>"Maybe, but my father is more than a match for you," snarled the girl hatefully.<p>"I don't think so, you see, the Saotome School of Anything Goes, is much stronger than the Tendo clan's art."<p>Akane's jaw dropped, she fell flat on her rear again as tears started to fall from her eyes. "No..." It had all come together when Ranma named her style. Everything the Elven girl said had made sense. Saffron didn't just kill the nobles, but wiped out their entire family. Only those who married into the ones who served him during that dark time were permitted to live. Her father was single and gotten married, she assumed that was what he had done.<p>"It's not true!" she screamed as she jumped to her feet again.<p>Ranma dropped her sword and jumped into the air in an instant. She vanished into the treetops leaving Akane standing alone.<p>The girl staggered back in surprise despite her emotional state. "Because I screamed?" she muttered in confusion. She didn't think anyone would be able to hear her very well from this distance. Although, her father might be growing worried enough to turn back. It probably wouldn't take very long before they came charging through the woods.<p>That was when she heard a very familiar sound in the distance. A faint roar that she could barely make out through the trees. "Herb!" she gasped as she rushed up to her horse.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Get Lord Tendo out of here!" screamed one of the knights as he thrust his spear forward. He stood in the middle of a human wall of shields and spears that they had created in front of the creature.<p>The remaining men formed a protective ring around the man as he was forced to charge to the right of the giant beast.<p>Herb snarled as he flapped his wings impatiently. His head snapped down and Lord Tendo was thrown from his saddle. The monster bit a huge chunk out of the man's horse as he latched his teeth around the staff. He gulped it down greedily as the men scooped up their master and thundered away while the beast's attention was elsewhere.<p>Ranma appeared behind the scene with a frown on her face. "Aw man. You jerk!"<p>Akane rode up just behind her with an angry looking snarl on her face. "I'll kill that lizard!"<p>She paused when she noticed the men were mounting up as Herb lost interest in them. He had turned away and was flapping his wings.<p>"No you don't!" cried Ranma as she bounded forward at top speed.<p>"What the hell is she doing?" muttered Akane as she stared at this dumbly.<p>Ranma sailed into the air and latched onto Herb's back just between his wings. "Uh oh. This was a bad idea," she muttered nervously as the violent jerking of the dragon's body took them into the air.<p>Herb shot forward and the scenery became a blur. Ranma struggled to hold on as the beast sailed into the air spinning like a top. They were going almost straight up. Herb snapped his neck back and nipped at Ranma almost playfully. His massive jaws just barely unable to reach the boy.<p>"At least I picked a good spot," muttered Ranma as she struggled to hold her legs down and out of reach.<p>Herb curled into a ball and went into free fall. Ranma looked down at the ground rushing up to her. "He wouldn't," she muttered fearfully. Herb's wings snapped out suddenly and there was a jerking halt. Ranma screamed as her arms were torn loose. She flailed about and latched onto the very tip of the dragon's tail. She flinched when the tail suddenly became much shorter in length. The elf even managed to cling too it despite the fact that it shrank in his grip.<p>A clawed fist reached down and grabbed the back of his shirt. She found herself looking the now half man half dragon in the face. Its golden eyes blinked as it stared at her coldly. They were high in the air and Ranma swallowed as she looked down. With a jerk of its arm the dragon-man tossed Ranma into the air behind it as it seemed to gag suddenly. His throat swelled into a giant bubble as he arched his neck back. In a shower of green fluid, the staff shot out of his throat and into his waiting palm. "Soon, I will become a living god."<p>He didn't even watch as the young elf vanished into the clouds below.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>Akane turned to face her father with a serious frown on her face. "Where is the emperor?" She had just caught up with him and it was the first thing out of her mouth. Her horse was jerking impatiently as she kept it ready to run.<p>"A two day ride to the north."<p>"Herb will be there in a matter of moments," said the girl as she nodded seriously. "I'm going." She rushed forward before her father spoke again.<p>"Be careful," muttered the man. He knew that Herb would not spare him or his family if he won.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>Ryuu glared at the scene in front of him angrily.<p>He was standing on a small cliff overlooking a large camp of soldiers. "Great."<p>"This is the third time today," muttered Ukyo.<p>"Guess we go around the long way," muttered Shampoo.<p>"Damn, this could take a few days if they don't move on soon. Wonder why they're all hanging around? Most of the elves should be dead or gone by now."<p>"Who knows?" said Ukyo with a small shrug. "Maybe they found something?"<p>Shampoo frowned at this. "I doubt it. There shouldn't be anything of real importance in there. I would be one of the people who would know about it."<p>Ryuu nodded at this. "Maybe someone told them to hang around for a while?"<p>"An invasion?" gasped Ukyo.<p>"Or backup forces for something going on nearby," said Ryuu with a short nod.<p>"Why are we going north? We could have just gone with Ranma," grumbled Shampoo.<p>Mousse growled slightly at this, but didn't add to the conversation.<p>"Because that's where we're both going, he's just taking a different and more dangerous route. We should see him soon after we get there, if he's not around already."<p>Shampoo didn't look happy with the answer and they turned into the forest again to sneak around the camp.<p>++++++++++++++++<p>Herb floated down to the ground calmly as he gripped the staff in his claws. His reptilian lips were curled back as he stared at it and raised it over his head. "At long last, I shall have my revenge!" He roared as flames began to flicker around the length of the weapon. They slowly crawled down his body as he stood holding it over his head. In a matter of moments, a raging torrent of flames had surrounded his body. They died down and he transformed back into a man. His eyes were glowing with power as he started walking forward. The Tendo clan would be right behind him. He turned to face the south and smirked as he stared into the valley. "Maybe I'll keep her around for a bit before I kill her. She's amusing if nothing else." He turned and started walking towards the Emperor's camp, he wasn't in any hurry to get there now.<p>+++++++++++++++++++<p>It had been a day and a half since Akane Tendo started riding after Herb. She now knew that the arrogant jerk was actually walking up to the Emperor to slap him in the face. "Traitorous Dog," she growled under her breath.<p>Her horse thundered forward, his speed seeming to mimic her rage.<p>Something familiar caught her attention as she rushed across the open fields and hills of the country. A small group on horseback, Lord Kuno and Herb's two lackeys. The two younger morons were waving at her cheerfully as they recognized her. It was fairly obvious that they probably hadn't spoken to Herb, but that was still only probably. Plus, Kuno and his posing horse made things a bit easier to decide.<p>Kuno's horse had its knee bent and head bowed down in a rather dramatic pose. He waited patiently for her to stop. "Akane Tendo my love, I am here to rescue you from the terrible dishonor fate has placed upon..."<p>Akane never even slowed down. Her metal gauntlet clanged against the side of Kuno's head, sending his feathered hat sailing into the air.<p>"Out of my way peon!"<p>Lime and Mint both stared down at Kuno, he was lying on the ground next to his horse; who had not changed position in the slightest.<p>"Guess she didn't have time to stop. You think the Emperor is after her now?"<p>Mint glanced at his companion for a moment and frowned. "Probably. She seemed to know where it might be though. Maybe she'll find it before she gets killed?"<p>"I hope so," said Lime cheerfully.<p>"Yeah, she has nice titties," said Mint with a small sigh.<p>Lime looked slightly irritated at this. "You're so lucky, you got to look at Lady Akane's titties."<p>"So did you, she danced and all that remember?" countered Mint.<p>"I guess, but you got a really good look. I mean, she was right over you right?"<p>Mint nodded with a slightly wistful look about him. "Yeah, but she still wouldn't let me touch them."<p>Kuno floundered on the ground suddenly and managed to roll onto his back. He sat up abruptly and had a deep frown on his face. "Come, she rides towards the Emperor's camp even now. We must deliver her message to him immediately. Then I shall ask the Emperor to give us the supreme honor of being married before him! She will no doubt be pleased with such a gesture."<p>"Either that or you've got some weird castration fetish," replied Mint.<p>Lime and Kuno both looked up at him in confusion. "What?"<p>The boy blushed slightly and scratched the back of his head. "It's nothing."<p>"Very well, we shall ride with Lady Akane to the Emperor. Once we catch up with her that is."<p>"Right," said Lime cheerfully. He paused and looked thoughtful as they trotted lazily into the open field before them. Apparently Kuno thought that his love would surely slow down to meet him. Once he got himself excited about it, he'd run his horse into the ground to catch her if he had too. For the moment, he was still daydreaming about meeting her again. Still, a though occurred too him and he leaned towards Mint. "Hey. If he thinks Lady Akane is going to see the Emperor, why couldn't we just tell him that Lady Akane could just deliver it herself?"<p>"Are you joking? He'd make us follow her anyway," replied the younger of the pair calmly. "Besides, it looks like she's running directly towards the Emperor's camp. Maybe she did find it? Even if she didn't, if we end up there, we might be able to dump the Great and Powerful Lord Kuno off on someone else."<p>"Right!" said Mint cheerfully.<p>Kuno heard only the part about himself being Great and Powerful, and cared not for the paltry musings of servants. He continued his lazy stroll while he contemplated how good his new wife would look with the new curtains in his bedroom. Besides, she would have to become the mother of his invincible legion of sons almost immediately. His virile loins were no doubt equipped for the task.<p>"Man, is he done yet? It'll take days for him to catch up to her soon," muttered Mint irritably.<p>"Well, she'll beat him up either way, so we can just wait until she does that and drag him to the main camp for medical attention or something."<p>They both seemed to cheer up at this and grinned at each other cheerfully.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>The sun was an orange orb over the horizon as Herb stood looking down at the encampment from the top of a large hill just to the north of it. He peered below as he held the Kajakan firmly in his grip. A dark smirk formed on his face as he heard a faint fluttering behind him.<p>"Kiima."<p>"You have obtained the Emperor's staff?" she asked coolly. Her wings folded over her shoulders, forming what appeared to be a white cape around her body.<p>"I have, and I do not intend to return it," he replied calmly. A burning power formed around his body and he turned to stare at her coldly. "I have come, to avenge the murder of my people."<p>"And to take his throne for yourself?" asked the woman as she simply smiled at him as she returned his hard stare.<p>"Of course. Merely an added perk, I assure you. I know you'll refuse any offer to join me, so you can go back and tell him I'm here."<p>"He already knows you're here," replied the bird woman as she spread her wings out. "Do you honestly believe that he would spare your life if you were any danger too him? Don't be absurd. He knew all along that you would turn against him. Even with that staff you're no match for him." Kiima looked quite smug as she crossed her arms over her chest and glared at him confidently. "Soon he will be a god, and you will be dead."<p>"Perhaps that is true, but you will not live to see it," snarled a voice from the shadows.<p>Kiima whirled around angrily towards the sound. She never noticed the dark shadow that swirled around her feet. Sharp tendrils of darkness slowly crept up through the air around her. Only when they dove deep into her body did she realize they were there. She screamed in agony as blood shot out her mouth and dripped down her body. Her speared wings and arms twitched violently as she hung suspended in the air.<p>"I never liked you anyway," said Nabiki as she seemed to melt from the darkness of the forest.<p>Herb frowned at her and snorted. "What are you doing here?"<p>"Settling a personal score. Now she can't get in my way anymore. High Priestess of Lord Saffron indeed."<p>"She told me Saffron knew about this."<p>"Maybe he does know? He's the Emperor, there's any number of ways he could have found out."<p>Herb gripped the staff a bit tighter and growled. "You have assured my victory?"<p>"Kiima was merely spouting the praises of her chosen master. She is a powerful sorceress, but she has no sight for such things."<p>Herb floated up into the air. "He comes."<p>"Yes, I know," said Nabiki as she turned away and stood staring at the suspended Kiima for a moment.<p>As Herb floated into the air, a large circle of light appeared on the ground in front of Kiima's twitching body. The darkness vanished in an instant and she fell too the ground. Nabiki smirked as a Wyvern appeared out of the circle, seeming to rise from under the ground.<p>Saffron's sorceress's eyes stared forward, she was still alive, but barely so.<p>Nabiki merely turned to look at the creature and chuckled. "Enjoy your dinner darling." She calmly stepped back to watch.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>"We're going the wrong way," grumbled Ukyo as she glared at Ryuu.<p>The party was holed up in a small cavern. There were entire legions of men camped all over the countryside. They had no idea there was this much of the Empire's army coming.<p>"What the hell is this?" grumbled the boy as he stood up and stared out at the camp in front of the opening. "I've seen major campaigns before, but this? What the hell is that stupid thing you had us steal anyway?" He glared at Shampoo, Ukyo stared too, but she didn't look upset with her.<p>"The Kajakan has a small shard of Godstone in it."<p>Ryuu staggered back with his hand held over his chest, he was making choking sounds as he fell flat on his rear and stared at her. "You...you...you bitch! Only ten million dollars for a job involving something like that? You ripped us off!"<p>"Well, you were given a large sum of money for this one as well. Stop complaining."<p>"A lousy two million for another job doing the exact same thing!"<p>"What does it matter how much the price? You've already been paid."<p>Ryuu glared at her and finally hung his head. "You're right." He stood up and shuffled away grumbling about elves being worse than dwarves about money.<p>Ukyo and Mousse were both staring at the princess in shock.<p>She sighed and gripped her knees. "He needs it to ascend to godhood."<p>"I thought you needed more than one," said Ryuu as he sat down in the dust just outside of the group.<p>"He has several others, this one was the least guarded. While it is an important artifact, it is also the symbol of his power. He has everything he needs if he gets his hands on it again. Fortunately, there is a time limit involved. Unfortunately, that is still several months away."<p>Ukyo didn't like the sound of that. "So what? We've got too get this thing back then right? Ranma shouldn't take too long."<p>"If the Emperor gets his hands on it again, he won't be able to steal it without me," said Shampoo calmly. "If he returns without it, we will have to attempt it again."<p>Ryuu didn't like the sound of that, but he knew she was right. He had is pride as well as Ranma.<p>"So why hasn't he already done it then?" asked Ukyo. She hefted her arms over the length of her spear and let them hang from it as she walked.<p>"He's waiting until his transformation comes. That will be the height of his power," replied Mousse. "There is an old prophecy involved as well. It says he is destined to fall at the hand of a great dragon spirit. It is said he will be vanquished by a powerful staff that the demon will possess, delivered to his hand by a powerful spirit. A new leader will rise from the battle that will be fought. The phoenix will be reborn in flames..."<p>"What?" muttered Ryuu as he stared at the boy.<p>"No one is sure what the last part means. It's basically been pieced together over many years from those born with the sight."<p>"What's a phoenix?" asked Ukyo. "I've never heard of that kind of creature."<p>"It's not surprising," replied Shampoo. "Only beings who live as long as the forests have existed really know anything about them. They're sort of birds made of fire, and they're really big and powerful, more than even a dragon."<p>"That doesn't sound pleasant," grumbled Ryuu.<p>"No kidding," agreed Ukyo as she stood up and walked towards the entrance. "Still, it doesn't change the fact that we're moving deeper into the camp. I'm betting if we keep going in this direction we'll end up at some sort of major command post. I've got no desire to be in that situation."<p>"This is the shortest way to get where we're going. We aren't sure how deep in we are either," said Ryuu calmly.<p>"So we'll take a longer safer route," replied Shampoo simply. "Ranma is the one taking the dangerous route, remember?"<p>Ryuu sighed and clenched his fist as he stared out into the sunset. "All right. We'll start moving west then. We should get moving, we need to get as far as we can while we have cover of darkness. Who knows, we might get lucky and find our way out before daylight?"<p>++++++++++++++++++++++<p>Herb floated in front of the setting sun. He had the Kajakan held upright at his side as he simply stared forward and waited. "Saffron."<p>A tiny figure stood on the ground below him with a frown on his face. He appeared to be a young boy with tiny brown wings. His face was serious and calm as he stared forward at the man as if he was nothing. "Herb."<p>"Oh, that's right. You can't even fly."<p>The boy stared him down with a heated looking frown on his face. "You jerk!"<p>"Come now boy. Just die quietly and I'll be quick about it."<p>Saffron merely shook his head with a soft chuckle. "You fool. You're not the fabled Dragon. You killed him almost ten years ago."<p>Herb frowned at this and clenched his teeth. "So, still the arrogant child."<p>The boy laughed playfully. "You're one to talk. Still, everything is going as was foreseen."<p>"Foreseen?" asked Herb as he pointed the staff at the boy. "Kiima does not have the gift of sight. She is..."<p>"Ah, but Nabiki Tendo does," replied the boy calmly.<p>Herb growled angrily. "We'll see who she favors then!" The ring on top began to spin and emitted a low hum as an orange ball of flames appeared inside the sphere that formed. He pointed the staff at the boy and snarled. "Let us make our destiny!"<p>"So we shall," said Saffron as he tilted his head slightly.<p>Herb screamed with rage as he let loose the magic that formed in the staff.<p>Saffron merely stood calmly as the ball of flames engulfed him and exploded.<p>Herb merely stood and watched the resulting dust and smoke cloud calmly. He gasped at the sound that came out of the flames that still burned in front of him.<p>It was a child's laugh.<p>"It can't be..."<p>"Fool. The Kajakan cannot harm me. I am Saffron, lord of fire, elemental spirit of the flame. No fire can harm me, magic or otherwise. Soon, I will be a god."<p>Herb growled with rage. "We'll see!" He charged forward with the staff, swinging it like an axe towards the boy.<p>Saffron merely put up his palm and caught it calmly. "Thank you for returning my staff too me."<p>Herb was caught completely off guard and was easily swung off the end of the staff. He hit the ground with enough force to carve a ten-foot gouge in the earth as he slid to a halt.<p>Saffron calmly walked over to him as he lay in the earth. He took slow purposeful steps and looked down at Herb with the staff in his hand. "Too bad, you were fun to play with." He raised the staff over his head and hacked down into Herb's gut. The man screamed in pain as his skin formed into scales in an instant. His scream became a roar as Saffron pulled the staff out and turned away. "No spell will heal that wound Herb. You will die now, slowly."<p>The creature on the ground merely stared up into the air while taking slow shallow breaths. He could not move and his body was slowly growing weaker. He could feel the burning intensity of his wound, and the blood that ran down his sides.<p>He wasn't sure how long he was there. He simply lay in what seemed like hours of agony. A familiar figure appeared out of the shadows. Nabiki Tendo walked up and lay down with her head resting directly next to his. "Thank you for murdering Kiima for me."<p>He did nothing and made no move to show that he had heard her.<p>"I'm going to bear your child. He will be the true chosen one, and will take the throne from Lord Saffron one day. I thought you might like to know. My magic will grant him the staff of power, and he will be the true embodiment of a dragon spirit."<p>"You forget something," said Herb in a soft whisper.<p>"What is that?" asked the sorceress cheerfully.<p>"The true Spirit of the Dragon still lives."<p>"That foolish pet thief of yours is not the Spirit of the Dragon. My sight has told me that much at least."<p>"No, but I now know who he is," replied Herb softly.<p>Nabiki stood up and snorted. "That is impossible. My sight would have revealed him if he lived yet. Soon, I will be High Priestess under Saffron, and then, I will simply await the time to take his power from him and make it my own."<p>"We shall see," replied Herb through a gasp of pain. His eyes were wide and simply stared up.<p>"Then tell me his name," said Nabiki as she smiled at him and brushed his jaws lightly. "I gave myself too you, you owe me that much at least."<p>"Betrayer," gasped the dragon. His chest went still quite suddenly.<p>Nabiki stood slowly and watched him for a long moment. "Damn." She turned away from him and walked into the night.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Ryuu glared irritably at the pile of wood in his arms. Daylight was growing close and the girls had actually whined him into making camp so they could eat and rest. He was standing on the edge of the forest looking out into the valley towards the nearest encampment. They didn't seem to be going anywhere. He'd agreed to a fire because it wouldn't look out of place early in the morning. The smoke would just blend in to the ones the encampments would use to make breakfast.<p>He paused when he noticed something on a hilltop nearby. It was big and appeared to be wounded. "What the?" He dropped his firewood and started walking forward.<p>It was Herb, he looked dead.<p>Ryuu got a huge grin on his face as he carefully walked out of the tree line and glanced around. There was no one for miles. He shrugged his shoulders and walked up to the creature calmly.<p>"You, are one of the men known as 'Dragon Ghost'?"<p>Ryuu jumped back and went into a combat stance immediately.<p>"Come boy. I am dying. I have much to speak too you about."<p>Ryuu narrowed his eyes at the thing. "What do you want? Where is the staff?"<p>"Already in the hands of the Emperor."<p>Ryuu's brow creased as he cursed under his breath.<p>"I have a favor to ask of you," said Herb as he looked up at the boy.<p>"Let me guess, you want me to eat your heart right?" Ryuu didn't look very impressed.<p>"If you do, you will gain my power," replied Herb through his short breaths.<p>"Yeah, and in about two hundred years or so, you'd just pop back up and kick me out of my own body. I know how it works."<p>Herb managed a soft laugh. "You know much young one. A pity."<p>"Yeah, for you," snorted Ryuu.<p>"That is not the favor I wish to ask of you. I am only half dragon, I am quite certain that will not work for me."<p>"Did you want something?" growled Ryuu as he kicked a bit of dirt into Herb's shoulder. The thing didn't even feel it, but it made him feel a bit better. "Why should I help you out anyway?"<p>"I knew about Jusenkyo, all those years ago. I let Ranma Saotome live. I was there, when Lord Tendo murdered his father."<p>Ryuu stared at the thing for a long moment. "Why?"<p>"Because, I needed him to deliver the staff to me, and complete my destiny. Revenge...if not by my hand, then by my word at my death."<p>"What? You want me to kill Saffron?"<p>"Saffron means nothing to me, I want you to kill Nabiki Tendo, and the demon she carries in her belly now. She seeks to manipulate the gods themselves. She is destined to failure and death."<p>Ryuu simply looked down at the creature and frowned. He nodded slowly and turned away. "I'll let Ranma decide that when I see him again. He's the one you saved."<p>Herb's eyes stared into the sky as it began to change from the darkness into the light. "Heh. Destiny, is a cruel thing too me it seems." He never saw the sun's rays creep over the horizon.<p>Ryuu stood watching him for a moment before turning back to the forest.<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>"Kiima is dead," said Nabiki as she knelt before the Emperor with a crystal sphere held between her fingers.<p>"How?" Saffron sat on his throne with a deep frown on his face. He seemed angry, but was remarkably even toned.<p>"Her body was not a pleasant sight," said one of the generals who stood on either side of the sorceress. "She appeared torn to pieces and eaten. As if killed by a large beast. We believe it was Lord Herb."<p>"Killed when she delivered your message by a power mad fool."<p>"You said nothing of this," said Saffron as he glared at her.<p>The girl merely bowed her head. "Even I cannot foresee all my Emperor. It was probably too unimportant to your destiny to matter in the visions."<p>Saffron nodded his head and waved his hand. "We will have a funeral when we return home. Send word to have preparations ready when I arrive."<p>"Of course," said Nabiki as she bowed to him deeply.<p>"You may go," said Saffron as he sighed and turned his head away from them and towards a window.<p>Nabiki gave a nod and turned towards the door, followed by the two generals. Neither one of the men was particularly important anyway, she veered away from them as they exited the hall and walked towards her tent. Herb was so much fun to play with, she'd probably miss him from time to time.<p>++++++++++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Heh. Evil that I am, I'm going to make you wait to find out what happened too Ranma. ^_^
