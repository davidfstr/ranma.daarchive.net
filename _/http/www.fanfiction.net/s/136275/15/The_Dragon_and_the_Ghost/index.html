</div>The Dragon and The Ghost<p>Part 15<p>Prisoner of Honor<p>+++++++++<p>Akane Tendo pulled herself up onto the path, and away from the<br/>edge of the waterfall. The Niku were dead, and she and Ranma had<br/>barely escaped with their lives.<p>Now, she found herself looking down the edge of the cliff and into<br/>the water below; a place that could have easily been her grave.<p>Ranma shifted her weight and grabbed the edge of the path as well.<br/>She pulled herself up slowly and grunted in effort as she attempted to<br/>heave herself up, only to find herself still hanging off the edge, and<br/>looking at a pair of black leather boots directly in front of her<br/>face.<p>"Well, well. It seems that you've made a mistake thief," said<br/>Akane with a cocky grin on her face as she placed her dagger on the<br/>girl's throat lazily. "Should I get rid of you now?"<p>Ranma glared up at her angrily. "I thought we were being nice for<br/>the moment. You gave your word."<p>"I said, until we escaped the cavern. We aren't in the cavern<br/>anymore," said Akane with a dark smile on her lips a she pressed the<br/>blade down a little bit against the soft flesh of the elf girl's<br/>throat.<p>"Of all the ungrateful little," muttered Ranma angrily, more to<br/>herself than the knight.<p>"Ungrateful? It's your fault I was in this mess in the first<br/>place," snapped the knight in retort.<p>"I could have just killed you in that castle you know," said the<br/>redhead angrily.<p>"You probably should have, I'm not particularly worried at the<br/>moment," replied the girl lazily as she pulled her hand back slightly,<br/>but not enough to allow Ranma to climb up any further.<p>"What are you going to do with me? I'm at your mercy after all,"<br/>spat the elf.<p>"I was thinking about cutting your throat, but that would be too<br/>easy. I think I'll just wait around for your arms to give out. If you<br/>try to get away, I'll just cut you open," said the knight with a shrug<br/>of her shoulders.<p>"I can hang here all day you know," said Ranma with her frown<br/>deepening.<p>"I've got plenty of time to wait," replied the knight.<p>Ranma growled; she might have been able to hang for that long, if<br/>she was male, and hadn't just spent the last hour or so running away<br/>from the demonic golems. As it was, her arms were beginning to burn<br/>from fatigue. "You can't kill me though."<p>"Why not? You're lucky I'm kind enough to do that," snapped Akane<br/>as she pushed the knife against the elf's throat again.<p>"Because you need me," said Ranma as she smirked back at her.<p>"What on earth for?" snapped Akane.<p>"The Kajakan. You can't go back without it can you?" said Ranma<br/>calmly.<p>Akane growled and narrowed her eyes at the girl. "What of it?"<p>"If you kill me, you'll never see it again. Ryu is as good as I<br/>am, you'll never find him without me," said the pigtailed girl as her<br/>grin widened suddenly. "You're as good as dead without me."<p>"I'll hunt them to the ends of the earth if I have too. I don't<br/>need you," snapped the knight bitterly.<p>"Come on. We're wanted on every country on the continent. No one<br/>knows what we look like, except for you maybe. To top it off, we've<br/>got hundreds of bounty hunters after us, all sorts of guards and<br/>soldiers, even wizards with more power than you could even dream of<br/>having. What makes you think you've got a chance in hell of finding<br/>him?" said the redhead haughtily.<p>Akane growled and glared at the girl as hard as she could. "I'll<br/>find a way."<p>"You'll die first. Killed by your own countrymen, or some bounty<br/>hunter along the line somewhere. You don't know how to hide away.<br/>Without me, you're dead, and you know it," insisted Ranma as calmly as<br/>ever.<p>"I don't fear death," replied Akane firmly.<p>"No, but you do want revenge, don't you?" said Ranma. She was<br/>starting to run out of ideas, and her arms were getting steadily<br/>weaker.<p>"What do you mean? Against you, or my bitch of a sister?" snorted<br/>Akane with a slight smirk on her face.<p>"Does it really matter?" said Ranma with the same grin. "If you<br/>kill me now, your revenge will be hollow. My last job will still have<br/>been completed. I'll die a legend, not great, but still a pretty good<br/>deal."<p>Akane's pride waged war inside of her for a moment, but finally,<br/>she conceded. "I suppose you're right," said the knight with a sigh as<br/>she turned and started walking down the path.<p>Ranma let out a long breath of her own and pulled herself up from<br/>the edge of the cliff. She sprawled out across the ground breathing<br/>heavily for a moment, and then raised her head and looked down the<br/>path at Akane. The knight was still walking away; Ranma narrowed her<br/>eyes and snorted just before she faded into nothing.<p>A moment later, Akane Tendo seemed to fall to the ground out cold,<br/>for no apparent reason.<p>+++++++++++<p>"How much further?" grumbled Ryoga as he looked back nervously.<br/>The party was walking down a snow-covered road, it was well traveled,<br/>but soldiers would use the larger ones that led directly to the city.<br/>They seemed pretty safe for the moment.<p>"Another two days," commented Ryu lazily as he walked calmly ahead<br/>of the nervous trio.<p>"It's been too quiet," commented Ukyo as she looked around.<p>"Actually, this is pretty normal. I'm good at my job, we shouldn't<br/>have any trouble getting to the border," said Ryu as he glanced back<br/>at her for a moment.<p>"Well, that's reassuring," commented Shampoo honestly.<p>"I still don't like this," grumbled Ukyo dejectedly.<p>"You act like you want something to happen. Some sort of grand<br/>escape, running from our pursuers and cutting through them in battle<br/>to get away," commented Ryu with a shrug.<p>Ukyo blushed. "I'm kind of used to that sort of thing."<p>"I figured as much, you knights aren't much for subtlety," said<br/>Ryu as he continued on his way, almost oblivious to the conversation.<p>"What's that ahead?" said Ryoga with a small frown. Down the road<br/>ahead of them, a small caravan could be seen coming down the road.<p>"Looks like traders," said Shampoo.<p>"No, gypsies of some kind," said Ryu as he narrowed his eyes and<br/>tried to see them a little better. "Locals I think."<p>Ukyo nodded at his assumption. "There are several traveling tribes<br/>that roam through the mountains. Most of them are humans."<p>"They're friendly enough, we should just pass by without any<br/>problems," said Ryu with a shrug.<p>"Their thieves, and vagabonds," snorted Ukyo in disgust.<p>Ryu just grinned back at her with his hands on top of his head as<br/>he strolled along. "Like I said, friendly people. Hide your wallets<br/>people, and don't let anyone run into you, especially kids."<p>Shampoo frowned, and held out her palm over her purse. It was a<br/>small leather bag that hung from her side.<p>"What did you do?" commented Ukyo.<p>"Don't notice me," replied the girl with a small shrug. "Want me<br/>to do yours?"<p>"Sure," commented Ukyo in slight surprise. "Don't try anything<br/>funny though."<p>"I'm not so petty," replied the elven girl with a small frown.<p>As soon as the spell was completed she looked to Ryoga. "How about<br/>you?"<p>"These gypsies aren't stupid enough to steal from a dwarf,"<br/>replied the small man gruffly.<p>"He's right," commented Ryu. "Elves and Dwarves would be left<br/>alone by most small time thieves, dwarves have a tendency to hold<br/>grudges."<p>"And elves?" said Shampoo with her eyebrow raising slightly.<p>"Have magic," said Ryu calmly. The lead of the caravan approached<br/>and he raised his arm in greeting. Weaving through a small crowd of<br/>children, who had suddenly appeared from the ranks of wagons,<br/>apparently sent out to play.<p>One of the kids stopped suddenly and looked back at him. "He's<br/>with a guild!" The child tossed back a worthless looking necklace to<br/>him, and Ryu caught it out of the air before winking at the child.<p>Shampoo and the others blinked as the crowd of kids seemed to<br/>disperse from around them suddenly.<p>The caravan continued onward, leaving the group of travelers<br/>behind unmolested.<p>"What the hell was that? How did he know?" snapped Ukyo.<p>"I can't say," replied Ryu as he put the necklace back inside his<br/>shirt before she noticed it.<p>"Honor among thieves?" said Shampoo with a slight chuckle.<p>"Indeed," agreed Ryoga with a small frown as he watched the<br/>caravan continue to move away.<p>"They would recognize a guild from that far away?" said Ukyo in<br/>shock. "You came from, Alura, if I recall."<p>"Don't be so naive, Ranma and I are a member of all of them,"<br/>snorted the boy as he continued to walk down the road.<p>"All of them?" muttered Shampoo in surprise. "That's not possible!<br/>There are hundreds; and considering the wars that happen between some<br/>of them..."<p>"What's that got to do with us?" snorted Ryu in reply.<p>++++++++++<p>"Where are we?" grumbled Akane irritably as she walked behind<br/>Ranma with her arms crossed over her chest.<p>"Just a road. It leads out of Joketsuko," snorted Ranma casually.<br/>"About a days walk from Morid."<p>"That far?" said the girl in surprise.<p>"We spent a while inside that cave," replied the thief casually.<p>"Where are we going elf?" snorted the angry woman as she looked<br/>away from her companion in disgust.<p>"Away from here," was the only reply.<p>Akane snorted, but remained silent. They were coming up on the<br/>edge of the woods that they were walking through. The sun shined down<br/>brightly on them suddenly as they found themselves in the middle of a<br/>snow covered clearing.<p>"Halt! Weep for joy at last! For I have come to save you Akane<br/>Tendo!"<p>"Oh shit," grumbled the knight as she spun on her heels and saw<br/>Tatewaki Kuno standing on top of a boulder.<p>"I know that voice," muttered Ranma under her breath as she slowly<br/>turned towards him as well. "Hello Kuno, it's been a while."<p>Akane glanced at the redhead in surprise. "You know him?"<p>"I did a job for him once, he offered me a place in his harem as<br/>opposed to paying me. Apparently he thought it was a better deal, I<br/>disagreed," snorted the pigtailed girl irritably.<p>Akane wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. "Kuno, what the hell<br/>are you doing here?"<p>"It is the Pigtailed Forest Nymph! Have you decided to give up<br/>your life of poverty and join me at the side of the beauteous Akane<br/>Tendo? Oh! How I weep for joy!"<p>"I'd rather stay with you than get rescued by the likes of him!"<br/>snapped Akane bitterly as she glared at her captor for a moment.<p>"Don't worry, I can handle this moron," snorted Ranma as she<br/>slowly unsheathed the blade from her back.<p>"I see you have kept that as a sign of your love," said the noble<br/>stoically.<p>"You still haven't paid me for getting it for you," replied the<br/>girl with a dark tone in her voice. "That damn dwarf hunted me down<br/>for four years because of you!"<p>"Surely he found it impossible to destroy such a flower of beauty!<br/>Come I shall give you your payment at last!" said the noble with tears<br/>of joy in his face.<p>"I want my money you jerk!" snapped Ranma as she jumped towards<br/>him with the blade held over her head.<p>Kuno spread his arms as if to embrace her as he jumped forward as<br/>well. "Come into my arms my love!"<p>Ranma paused in mid air as two blurs passed by, crossing directly<br/>between them in the air. Both she and Kuno landed, staggering back on<br/>their feet as they hit the ground.<p>"What the?" muttered Ranma in shock as she looked at the two<br/>figures that flanked her.<p>"I wouldn't recommend that," said the wolf man as he bared his<br/>teeth at her.<p>"We don't like it when people attack our superiors. However much<br/>we dislike them personally," agreed the tiger man as he glanced back<br/>at Kuno for a moment.<p>Ranma smirked suddenly from between them. "Beast men huh? How<br/>boring."<p>"We've come for the Kajakan, where is it?" snapped Lime as he<br/>backed away slightly<p>"Tell us, and we might let you live," agreed Mint as he moved back<br/>slightly as well.<p>"Heh, we don't have it," replied the redhead calmly as she<br/>sheathed her blade and stood calmly suddenly.<p>"Lady Akane! Are you all right?" said Lime as he looked over his<br/>shoulder. He paused when he saw her standing over the prone form of<br/>Kuno, huffing angrily as she glared down at him.<p>"Lady Akane I love you? I wish only to be with you my love? I knew<br/>it! Jerk! Asshole! Pervert! Philanderer!" she punctuated each word<br/>with another kick.<p>"Please! Don't kill him! We'll get in trouble!" whined Mint as he<br/>started to move towards her tentatively.<p>Akane leveled a glare at him and he backed away with his ears<br/>pressed against his head. Lime was doing the same thing.<p>"He... was yours?" muttered Ranma in half amusement.<p>"He was not! This delusional jerk was never mine!" snapped the<br/>knight as she spun around and faced the elf.<p>"We're here to take you back!" said Mint with a sudden nervous<br/>cheer in his voice.<p>"Yeah!" agreed Lime.<p>"So this ass can get credit for rescuing me? I think not!" snapped<br/>the girl bitterly as she whirled around at them again. "I'd rather die<br/>out here!"<p>"Please, be reasonable!" muttered Mint pathetically.<p>"She never has been before," commented Ranma lazily as she sat<br/>back and watched the scene in amusement.<p>"Who are you anyway?" snapped both beast men as they turned<br/>towards her. They growled and stalked towards her, she seemed rather<br/>calm about the whole affair.<p>"Just a thief," she said with a small shrug.<p>"Oh, do you know where the Kajakan is?" said Lime as he sat down<br/>in the snow and looked towards Mint calmly.<p>"Yeah?" agreed Lime.<p>"No," said the thief with another small shrug.<p>"Oh, never mind then," said Mint as he turned towards Akane. "Can<br/>we eat her?"<p>Akane stopped beating on the prone form of Kuno and blinked. She<br/>suddenly became angry again. "No! I need him to get the Kajakan back!"<p>"Him?" muttered Mint as he turned and looked at the elf for a<br/>moment. The redhead had a stupid looking grin on her face.<p>"I don't think she's all there right now. I say we eat the elf,<br/>and take Lady Akane back home," said Lime after a moment of thought.<p>"Sounds like a plan," agreed Mint cheerfully.<p>"A bad one at that," deadpanned Ranma as she glared at them.<p>"Huh? What's wrong with it?" said Lime in irritation.<p>"Well, besides me getting eaten, Akane will be killed if she goes<br/>back without the Kajakan," said the elf with yet another shrug. "Not<br/>that you could eat me anyway."<p>"Hey! We can eat you! I've eaten lots of elves!" snapped Lime.<p>"Have not," muttered Mint under his breath.<p>"Shut up! I have too! So have you!" said the tiger man as he<br/>glared at his friend for a moment.<p>"Huh? Oh, yeah! Right, we both have!" said the wolf man with a<br/>sudden dawning on his face.<p>"Um, right," muttered Ranma as she walked between them. "I'll just<br/>go stop Akane from killing that guy now."<p>Both beast men whirled around and got shocked looks on their<br/>faces. "No! Lady Akane! Please don't rip those off! He might need them<br/>someday!"<p>++++++++++++<p>Nabiki smiled as she watched Akane Tendo attempt to do grievous<br/>bodily harm to the prone form of Tatewaki Kuno.<p>"Well, I never knew she had it in her," she commented lazily as<br/>she sipped at a goblet of wine and looked over at Herb. He was<br/>standing near the doorway with a smug looking grin on his face. "There<br/>may have been hope for her yet."<p>"So, we have it then?" said Herb as he walked up to her calmly.<p>"No, they don't appear to have the Kajakan with them," replied<br/>Nabiki as she glared into the mirror again for a moment.<p>"What?" snapped Herb angrily. The image faded away as he turned to<br/>look at it, Ranma had looked directly at him for a moment it seemed,<br/>before the image faded.<p>"Don't worry so much darling. There were a few of them missing.<br/>Our old friend, and my sister appeared to be alone for the moment.<br/>That's why I told you to send those two after them. It's always easier<br/>to watch him, if there's someone nearby I can lock onto." The witch<br/>tossed her hair over her shoulder and took another drink from her cup.<p>Herb grabbed her by her throat and lifted her off the floor,<br/>causing her to spit the liquid into the air in surprise. "Where is<br/>it?" he snarled angrily.<p>Nabiki looked down at him and snarled. Her hands thrust forward,<br/>and he was thrown back into the wall of the room. She raised her hand<br/>as she landed and he slid about three feet up the wall, clutching at<br/>his throat. "Don't forget who you're talking to darling. I have as<br/>much to lose as you do. I will find it." She released him and he fell<br/>to the ground, landing on his feet calmly.<p>"Of course, forgive me," said the man placidly as he bowed his<br/>head slightly. A light smile formed on his lips. She had been afraid<br/>for a moment, they both knew he could have killed her easily if he had<br/>wanted too. "I acted rashly."<p>Nabiki smirked for a moment and looked him up and down. "Yes, it's<br/>such a turn on Herb darling."<p>"Maybe later, find me the Kajakan," said the man as he whirled<br/>around and let his cape billow out as he left her alone in the room.<p>"Of course, my love," she replied with a dark look in her eyes as<br/>she turned towards the mirror again.<p>+++++++++++<p>Akane rushed along the snow with Ranma at her side. While the two<br/>beast men were distracted with saving Kuno, Ranma had belted them both<br/>over the head and sent them to the ground. They wouldn't be out long,<br/>and she knew it. Now, she forcefully pulled Akane along beside her.<p>"Where are we going?" snapped the knight angrily.<p>"There!" said Ranma as she pointed to the road below. A long<br/>caravan passed by below them.<p>"We can't hide down there! Lime and Mint will..." started the<br/>knight.<p>"They can't track us. I hid our scent from them," replied the elf<br/>girl with a small smirk.<p>"Huh? You can do that?" muttered Akane in shock.<p>"Of course. Every thief worth his salt knows that spell. It's<br/>easy," replied the elf girl with a small wink. "Come on. I know these<br/>people, they'll hide us."<p>"If you hid our scent..." started Akane with a small frown.<p>"I didn't have time to hide our tracks," replied Ranma as she<br/>pointed back at the footprints. "If we ride with them for a way,<br/>they'll just think that they lost them on the road. They'll head in<br/>the most obvious direction, away from Joketsuko. If we travel with<br/>these people for about half a day, and double back..."<p>"Right, they'll have given up chasing us by then," agreed Akane.<p>"At the very least, we'll be able to move behind them. Which is<br/>the best place to hide if someone is chasing you," said Ranma with a<br/>light smirk on her face.<p>Akane sighed and nodded her head. She knew there was no way she<br/>could go back yet, she would never live down the shame of failing if<br/>she did, if she wasn't put to death on sight that is.<p>+++++++++<p>"So, you need to be hidden away? From these invaders of the<br/>emperor?" said the chieftain of the gypsy tribe as he looked the two<br/>women up and down.<p>He was an older man, of about sixty years old. He didn't look much<br/>older than forty, and a very capable forty at that. He had a long<br/>white beard, and broad shoulders. His dress was brightly colored<br/>pants, and a dark vest. Most of the other men were in similar clothes.<p>The women wore long colorful dresses, and white shirts with<br/>bandannas tied on their heads. Many wore ornate jewelry, and large<br/>earrings.<p>They were in the back of the lead wagon. It seemed almost like a<br/>closet inside, or a dressing room. A few small beds rested along the<br/>back end of the wagon, with a small table in the center. Three men<br/>stood in front of the two women.<p>"That's right, we're willing to pay," said Ranma calmly as she<br/>showed him a medallion that she had pulled from her shirt. It was one<br/>of many, but he didn't know that either.<p>"Hmm, it looks authentic," said the man with a nod.<p>"Another with one like it passed by earlier. Heading to the<br/>south," commented one of the men nearby. "My son reported it."<p>"Aye, I remember," agreed the older man.<p>"My partner," confirmed Ranma with a small nod.<p>"I see, you are in the middle of a job then?" said the old man<br/>calmly.<p>"That's my business," replied Ranma.<p>"All right," chuckled the old man merrily. "I suppose we should.<br/>Tell me your names."<p>"I'm Ranma, and this is Akane," said the redhead with a serious<br/>nod.<p>Akane merely bowed her head. Ranma had told her not to speak, and<br/>she had fortunately seen the wisdom of that. She doubted if she could<br/>curb her tongue against such rubbish for very long.<p>"Ah, I take it she is also a part of this guild?" said the man as<br/>he looked her up and down. The loose black clothing was normal for a<br/>thief.<p>"She's part of this, I won't say more. I'm afraid I can't<br/>elaborate any more than I have," said Ranma cheerfully.<p>"I see, come on then. We'll get you some clothes," said the man<br/>with another small laugh.<p>"Nothing too girlish I hope," grumbled Ranma as she watched him<br/>pick up a box full of brightly colored clothing.<p>"Just hope they're kind enough to give me some privacy," snorted<br/>Akane angrily.<p>Ranma merely smiled as she watched the men leave the cabin. She<br/>had noticed several small peepholes inside the walls, but thought it<br/>would be best not to mention that.<p>Akane looked at her and tapped her boot on the ground impatiently.<br/>"Well?"<p>"Well what?" replied Ranma in surprise.<p>"Get out so I can change you pervert!" snapped the knight as she<br/>barely held back her rage.<p>"Oh," said the elf with a sour look appearing on her face. "Look,<br/>you don't have anything I don't have better alright. If it bothers you<br/>that much, just wait until I'm done. It'll look weird if we take<br/>turns." The redhead pulled out a colorful dress and tossed it over her<br/>shoulder. Throwing a bra, and pair of panties aside. She never had<br/>worn them, and probably never would. "I don't see how you can wear<br/>these things, they're damn uncomfortable," she commented with a small<br/>glance back at her companion.<p>"Pervert," grumbled Akane as she started to pull her boots off.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Tatewaki Kuno frowned as he walked along the path and glared at<br/>the two beast men in front of him. "You lost the scent? Fools!"<p>"It's not our fault! That elf probably knows magic to hide it from<br/>us! She's a thief after all!" replied Mint irritably.<p>"Where are we going?" said Kuno as he noticed the pair shift back<br/>into their human forms.<p>"Back to Morid, there's no point in chasing after them. We'll<br/>never see them again. We need to consult with Mistress Nabiki again,"<br/>said Lime angrily. He was still rubbing the spot on the back of his<br/>head where he had been hit.<p>"Hey, what's that?" commented Mint as he looked at the orange<br/>light ahead of them.<p>"Looks like some sort of camp," said Lime as he looked back<br/>towards Kuno for instruction.<p>"We will greet them. Perhaps they have a bit of food, and a warm<br/>place for me to rest my head," he said with remarkable calm.<p>"Right!" agreed the pair cheerfully.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Akane stood beside Ranma by one of the fires. She had been<br/>brooding all day.<p>"Hey, you don't look bad in a dress," said the redhead cheerfully<br/>as she handed her a mug of beer. She had just returned from getting<br/>the drinks, and two empty plates rested on the ground where they were<br/>sitting.<p>"Neither do you," replied Akane snidely.<p>"Yeah, I guess I don't," snorted the elf crudely.<p>Akane rolled her eyes, the elf girl had clearly been restraining<br/>herself from attacking various men all day. The gypsy men were far<br/>from shy, and she had too restrain herself as well, numerous times.<br/>Even by some men who were old enough to be her father. There were a<br/>few black eyes and bruised noses within the camp, but nothing worse.<br/>Which was unfortunate in her mind.<p>"We'll rest here tonight," said Ranma as she took a swig of her<br/>drink and looked at a group of men who passed nearby.<p>"I don't trust them," snorted Akane as she noticed the men were<br/>also looking at them.<p>"Neither do I, but we'll be safer here than on the road. Besides,<br/>either one of us could handle any man here without much trouble. I'm<br/>not particularly worried about that."<p>Akane took a drink of her own and made an unusual face as she<br/>looked at the mug for a moment. She swallowed and gasped for breath.<br/>"What is this stuff?"<p>"Beer, It ain't palace wine, but it'll get you drunk a lot<br/>quicker. Try not to over do it all..." Akane looked over to the<br/>redhead as she trailed off suddenly.<p>"What is it?" said Akane with a frown.<p>"Shit," muttered Ranma as she pulled her up forcefully and into<br/>the crowd.<p>"What are you doing?" said Akane angrily. She would have screamed<br/>the words if not for the look on the elf girl's face.<p>"Kuno is here," snapped the redhead as she ducked behind one of<br/>the wagons that surrounded the camp.<p>"He's found us?" said Akane in shock.<p>"I don't think so," said the pigtailed girl as she eyed the<br/>approaching noble cautiously. Kuno was speaking with one of the gypsy<br/>men, just on the edge of the camp. "He probably gave up a little<br/>sooner than expected, that's all."<p>"How do you know?" snapped Akane.<p>"He's just asking for a place to stay," said Ranma as she turned<br/>to wink at her.<p>"We should leave then," said the knight firmly.<p>"No, I don't think that'd be a good idea. Your two friends are<br/>relatively human now. Things could get messy real fast. Gypsies don't<br/>like beast men," said Ranma coolly.<p>"What are you planning?" said Akane coolly.<p>"A distraction, hopefully good enough to get them off our back for<br/>a long time," said the pigtailed elf as she smirked in the darkness.<br/>"Come on." She pulled on Akane's arm and dragged the knight deeper<br/>into the camp.<p>+++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next time: Lime and Mint's dream realized at last?<p>
