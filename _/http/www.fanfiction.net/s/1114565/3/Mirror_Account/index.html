</div><p>Mirror Account.</p><p>...</p><p>Chapter 3: Shit, meet Fan.</p><p>"You  saw it, didn't you, Tank?" Morpheus was rapt as he stood at the helm of  the Nebudchanezzar, his jackboot clicking rhythmically on the metal flooring in  an effort to appease his nervousness.</p><p>"I  saw the numbers, Morpheus. It's impossible." Tank was still staring at the  monitors, not even looking up at the older man to see the expression that he  knew was there. It was another One. "You're acting like you just saw a  burning bush, or a stone spouting water, Morpheus."</p><p>Tank  could hear the smile in Morpheus' voice. "No, Tank. It was just a  girl." He abruptly stopped his tenuous rhythm, spun on his heel and turned  towards the monitors and Tank. "How are Trin and Cypher doing?"</p><p>"They're  almost there, Morpheus. The Oracle should be waiting."</p><p>The  older man smiled again. "Yes, indeed."</p><p>Morpheus  seated himself comfortably in the pilot's seat of the Nebudchanezzar and turned  the autopilot off as he gunned the engines and headed for the source of the  small blip that they had not picked up, somewhere on the easternmost of the  continents.</p><p>Ranma  stared at the blood that adorned her hands, not bothering to even touch the wet  rag that Trinity had supplied her from seemingly nowhere as she sat in the back  of the mysterious black Sedan and Cypher spoke to Trinity in hushed tones,  assuming that she didn't hear him, acting as if she wasn't less than four feet  away.</p><p>"Did  you see that, Trin? Did you fucking see that?" She killed ten of them!  She's incredible!"</p><p>"Calm  down, Cy."</p><p>"But  she killed them, Trin! Nobody's k-"</p><p>"Shut  the hell up, Cy! She can hear you!"</p><p>Both  woman and man turned to look back on Ranma as one as she stared at her hands,  still covered in blood.</p><p>"Get  your eyes back on the road." Ranma heard her voice cracking in grief,  though she felt none. It was all an act in the end, wasn't it?</p><p>Cypher  turned around but Trinity still kept her eyes on Ranma, staring daggers into  her.</p><p>"They  weren't human, you know."</p><p>Ranma  looked up. "Like the guys that were chasing after you before, right?"</p><p>Trinity  nodded.</p><p>"Well  why is it so different." Ranma couldn't understand what wasn't human about  those guys. They certainly looked it, and felt it as well. They had bones.  She'd cracked every one of them.</p><p>Cypher  snorted, not taking his eyes off the road.</p><p>"Take  my word for it," Trinity's eyes bespoke sympathy. "You're about to find out  more than you could ever want to know.</p><p>Unsatisfied, Ranma gave up  the point for the moment, scrubbed the now-caked blood from her hands, and closed  her eyes and took some much-needed rest as the car wound its way across Japan.</p><p>Ranma shifted uneasily,  keeping his distance from Akane.</p><p>"How are you here?" He dared barely to even  breathe as he forced the words out, wishing he had never turned the lights on,  looking for his clothing, but not finding any.</p><p>The short-haired girl only looked at him confusedly, tears  welling up in her big, blank eyes as the steam that her breath caused when  impacting with the cold air of the room played down between her breasts, exciting  Ranma, much to his own aggravation and embarrassment.</p><p>"We've been like these forever, haven't we,  Ranma?" She got up, giving Ranma a full view of her body for the first  time in years.</p><p>"Sit the hell down, Akane!" Ranma allowed some  of his fury at the girl to show. She sat down with a little whimper, obediently  following Ranma's order to the very letter. "You can't just barge back  into my life like this. Especially not now! How the hell did you find me,  anyway? <i>I</i> don't even know where I am!" He sat down on the bed, his  back to Akane. She immediately put her arms around him as if by reflex and  began kissing the back of his neck.</p><p>"Get the <i>Hell</i>  off of me!" Ranma stood up abruptly, knocking Akane off of the bed, and  the girl suddenly froze, not moving even a millimeter.</p><p>"Why do you push this away," A deep, familiar,  grandmotherly voice queried from somewhere. "This is what you want, is it  not? You loved her once."</p><p>"Cologne?" Ranma knew her tired old voice  anywhere.</p><p>"No" An old, motherly woman stepped out of the  bathroom. "I picked your brain, and chose a voice that was appropriate.  Like you, I'm out of place here. You can call me the Oracle, for the time  being."</p><p>"You did what?"</p><p>"I read your mind." The woman allowed herself a  smile and pulled a chair that Ranma had not noticed before up to the bed.  "That's not important, though. You're here because you're special. You're  here because we can help each other."</p><p>"In other words, you want something from me."  Ranma gave the woman a level stare, but could not seem to meet her gaze. There  was something in her eyes that bespoke years beyond anything that Ranma could  imagine.</p><p>The woman smiled obligingly. "It seems that it's time  for you to go, and time for you to return. We shall speak later.</p><p>Akane resumed her motion and bore down on him as if on  cue, kissing him savagely with a strength which he was unable to combat, and  blackness came shortly after, followed by Glaring light. He was awake, released  from the nightmare.</p><p>Tank pulled wickedly long needle out of the back of a  gasping Ranma's neck, staring at the screens and trying to find out what  happened. Finally, after seeing perfectly normal readings across the board, he  gave up and asked Ranma.</p><p>"What do you mean 'what happened'?" Ranma was sitting up  now, testing his slightly atrophied arms.</p><p>"Well...you didn't come out on a hard-line. You aren't  dead. In the past, those two have been mutually exclusive. How'd you get out?"</p><p>"I just fell asleep. I passed out, I think." Ranma looked  at Tank pensively. "Someone called The Oracle was talking to me. She seemed to  know what was going on."</p><p>Tank's ragged face suddenly split into a grin. "Ah! She  would, wouldn't she? You'd better head back down there. Morpheus'll be getting  there any minute."</p><p>Ranma sighed and sat back down in the chair as Tank  inserted the needle once more and the world pulled through that now-familiar  inversion. When he 'awoke' in the bedroom, the Oracle was standing there, a  curious half-smile on her face, but Akane was gone.</p><p>"Back so soon?" the woman said in a tone that told Ranma  that she knew he'd be there. "That's good. Why don't you head down to the dojo  for a while? This should be fun."</p><p>Ranma opened her eyes, feeling the car stop, and found  herself outside the hotel that she had run to after meeting Trinity for the  first time. "This is…"</p><p>"We're here." Trinity interrupted her, concise. "This is  the Oracle's place in Japan."</p><p>As Ranma stepped out of the car, the sun caught her eyes  and the wind blew, tickling her skin. That reminded her of something. She was  stuck this way.</p><p>"I want my body back." She sighed as Trinity looked at her  inquisitively. "Let's go. I wanna get this over with."</p><p>Ranma's  heart leapt as he saw the familiar fiery hair blowing in the wind so far below  from the window of the dojo.</p><p>"Cold  water!" His voice came unintentionally as a sort of harsh general's bark.  The oracle stood near him, unsurprised, holding a vase full of cold water.  Ranma greedily snatched it out of her hands and dumped it over his head.</p><p>Trinity  led the young girl to the front door of a pristinely clean hotel office and  knocked gingerly. A young woman opened the door and smiled softly.</p><p>"The  Oracle is still with you. She'll be with you in a minute." The amusement  in her voice was plain.</p><p>"Huh?"  The confusion on Ranma's face at the seemingly paradoxical speech of the woman  was nothing short of comical.</p><p>"Articulate  girl, aren't you? Wait a minute, ok-" A sudden earthquake rocked the  hotel. "Never mind!" The woman laughed merrily. "She's done  early." She beamed at Ranma and took her hand. "Come with me. There's  somebody you should meet."</p><p>Ranma  stood, soaked and male, and laughed more joyously than he had in as long as he  could remember. He was still male! This had to be a dream! Leaving the Matrix  must have cured his curse for good!</p><p>But  who was the girl?</p><p>"She's  here." The Oracle stood up and approached the door to the dojo as if in  response to Ranma's own thoughts, which he no longer doubted was possible.</p><p>The  Oracle slid the door aside to reveal a female version of Ranma, poised with her  hand ready to knock on the door, a bemused look on her face. The look quickly  dissolved into a piercing gaze of hatred as she made eye contact with Ranma.</p><p>"You!"  The girl's voice was a snarl and her eyes bloodshot. "Give me my body back,  you bastard!" She quickly took an offensive stance as her battle aura  flared.</p><p>Ranma  quickly turned to the Oracle to ask her to explain this, but found nothing.</p><p>He  was going to have to fight for his life.</p><p>"I  don't know who you are, or why you look like that." Ranma took a more  defensive stance of his own, knowing that it would not matter in the least if  this girl's aura was what it looked like. "But you'd better be able to  back that up. I just got rid of that damned curse, and I'm not about to let you  ruin this."</p><p>Trinity  stood, watching the perimeter of the hotel, holding her cell phone at ready and  waiting for the call that she knew would come, telling her to prepare the  female Ranma for freedom, when Morpheus came up behind her and took her  shoulder in his large, calloused hand.</p><p>"Where  is she?"</p><p>It  took Trinity a couple seconds to regain from the shock of being snuck up on as  she pointed towards the hotel.</p><p>"Sorry  for the scare. We found her, but something's odd.  The male's neurokinetics just shot up  astronomically. Have you seen any agents or anything?"</p><p>Trinity  shook her head, about to say that everything was quiet when the windows of one  of the higher floors blew out, yielding two bodies, both hurtling towards the  ground in slow motion, throwing punches at each other at blinding speeds, one  in an ill-fitting dark suit, a female sporting a red pigtail, the girl, the  other in Chinese clothing. It was Ranma, both Ranmas.</p><p>Onna-Ranma  threw one, ten, a hundred punches at her seeming male counterpart as he blocked  every one with an opposite fist. She kicked, and met the tip of his opposite  foot. They fought seamlessly, neither one making a single strike, but both  battering their hands and feet with parried and intercepted strikes. After what  seemed like hours, the two of them hit the ground. Ranma looked around quickly  to find a playing field where she could have the advantage, and spotted a  swimming pool. She began a loping run for the pool and looked back to lead the  male Ranma on, but he was on his way too, matching her step for step, and  looking as confused as she felt.</p><p>"HALT!"  The voice was deafening, and jarred both Ranmas out of their battle.</p><p>The  old woman who they had both come to recognize as the Oracle stood next to the  pool, staring at both of the drenched martial artists, and shook her head.</p><p>"I  would let you two go on if I did not know what was going to happen. Now is not  the time for this." She bent over the pool and took a female Ranma's hand,  hauling her out of the pool with uncanny ease, and followed suit with the male  Ranma.</p><p>"Ranko.  Child..." The Oracle shook her head. "There is no Kaisui-Fuu, this time. There  is no pill, no technique, and no pressure point. You are female. Face it."</p><p>The  girl made a motion to leap at the male Ranma again. "This is all his fault!"  Fortunately, an iron grip from the Oracle kept her from even moving.</p><p>"Go see Morpheus." The Oracle's voice, completely calm,  heralded dire consequences if Onna-Ranma (<i>No.  Ranko, </i>she told herself<i>)</i> did not  do what she said. Thinking better of starting a fight with this woman, Ranko  quickly made towards the figure of Morpheus with her usual loping run. Male  Ranma made a move to follow but the Oracle stopped him.</p><p>"You don't hurt her, boy. Do you hear me? She is you, in  every possible sense of the word. Put yourself in her shoes. She's got more of  a hell than you or I can imagine sitting before her. You hurt her and you won't  live long enough to regret it. Now go help her out." The Oracle smiled at Ranma  as if he was a toddler who had just gotten sand in his eyes and patted him on  the back. "You don't have much of an easy time coming yourself. Come back and  see me together when she's situated."</p><p>Ranma nodded, only understanding what the Oracle was  saying halfway, and ran after the red-headed girl, yelling out for Morpheus to  get the rig set up to free Ranko.</p><p>Ranko, as she would have to call herself until she found a  way out of this, watched the small bathroom mirror next to the ridiculous chair  that Morpheus had her sitting in. Slowly, deliberately, her reflection winked  and blew a kiss at her. She heard a chuckle somewhere behind one of the piles  of equipment and the world inverted, allowing blackness to rain and pink goo to  cover Ranko, head to toe.</p><p><i>Pink goo?</i></p><p>She looked around, having trouble focusing, and then felt  something wholly unnatural in her mouth, pumping something into her stomach.  She flailed madly, trying to yell, trying to fight it, and them something <i>pulled</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, she felt the pinpricks of a limb waking up and  open air greeted her with a fire-water hello, burning her inside and out with a  corrosive pain that almost made her lose consciousness. Something grabbed her  neck, strangling her, and them she felt arms around her, holding her. A towel  or blanket wrapped itself around her and she still felt the arms, strong and  supporting, holding her. Finally, she felt the warmth of a bed under her, and  allowed her mind to drift off to sleep. She couldn't handle this. What was  going on?</p><p>Mouse kept his arms wrapped around the child even as he  brought her to the bed and lay her down. This was the One? She was so frail! He  watched all through the night, hours on end as she fitfully slept and sometimes  even cried out.</p><p>"What are you dreaming of, eh?" He allowed himself one of  his rare smiles.</p><p>Attuned ears picked his voice up as, almost  simultaneously, Ranko woke up and Trinity walked into the room.</p><p>"It's a trip, eh?" Trinity looked at Ranko openly for the  first time she could remember. "The guys never get how it feels." Ranko was  sure that if she could see the woman clearly, she would have seen her wink.</p><p>A hand patted her arm, and then another.</p><p>"Sleep well. Mouse and I will be within hearing range if  you need anything."</p><p>Author's Note:</p><p>That was a short chapter, but I hope it will get longer.</p><p>C&amp;C are wonderfulllll!</p><p>-Inu</p>
