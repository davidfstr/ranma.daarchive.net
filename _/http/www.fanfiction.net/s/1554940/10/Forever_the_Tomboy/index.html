</div>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer<p>A/N – Just in case it's not clear the first few paragraphs of this chapter occur before the Scouts teleport home. (Which was done in Ch. 9) I wanted to expand that encounter a bit, hopefully it's not to confusing. Also thanks to a review from Ranma Crossover Archive who mentioned some misspellings on names. Went back to my original sources and by golly (g) he was right. Saotome is now spelled correctly and fixed the (inadvertent) confusion with Misaki (Ayeka &amp; Sasami's mom) and Masaki (the Clan) I knew the difference but apparently my fingers did not as I had it correct most – but not all the time. See additional authors notes at end of the story.<p>Forever the Tomboy Ch. 10 -<p>Meetings, Discussions and New Beginnings?<p>"Let me go Usa," the now transformed senshi of Pluto snarled, "I'm going to kill that bastard, now LET ME GO!" Pluto glared as the as yet unmoving form laying so close to Michiru. Whatever attack she had used had dropped him in his tracks, but even so Pluto wasn't satisfied.<p>She was however, astounded at the strength of the younger girl's grip on her arm as she struggled to pull free. The senshi of Pluto wanted, no needed really, to get loose and vent her anger on the one who so richly deserved it. Uncharacteristically, tears poured down her face, her anger was mixed with a good portion of grief as she looked out at the fallen forms lying ever so still in the sun drenched meadow. Two of the four meant the world to her, the other two nothing. To Setsuna it didn't seem right that the sun was shining or that the birds were singing so merrily around her when her heart was filled with so much pain.<p>The senshi of time knew that sometimes losses occurred. She knew that the good guys didn't always win . . . and sometimes even the price of victory was to steep. She was reminded of the words of a Yankee General from the American's own Civil War. With a wisdom that might not have been suspected of him he had said that "The only thing worse than a battle won was a battle lost."<p>Those words rang true to her today. Michiru had won her fight, and had paid quite a price to gain that victory. But what happened to her next went far beyond what Setsuna was willing to accept. She still didn't know exactly why Michiru had to come here, but she did know that her friend had been hurt and hurt badly. Not only was she hurt from the fight with Happosai, she had been blindsided by some stranger while she was still reeling from the damage she had taken in that fight.<p>The hate-filled voice of the bandana wearing boy still echoed in her mind. The fool had attacked with no warning other than a single hate filled scream and the words "Ranma prepare to die," as he attempted to strike Michiru down. Not only that, but he had been so lost in his rage that he had hurt Hotaru when she tried to stop his unwarranted attack.<p>At the present moment the only thoughts running through Pluto's mind were those of vengeance. She was going to feed him a Dead Scream, . . . a full blown, no holding back version of her favorite attack and she realllly hoped that it wouldn't kill him. This hope was not born out of any feeling of remorse or pity, no she hoped he survived so she could do it again and again until he felt at least a fraction of the overwhelming pain that she was experiencing.<p>Setsuna was normally the epitome of control, but not here and not now. Right now she control was the last thing on her mind. Right now she wanted nothing more and nothing less than to inflict a whole world of pain on the one who had hurt her family, she wanted him to SUFFER. Right now she was almost as lost in her anger and pain as the coward who had hurt Hotaru. She knew that if she could pry herself loose from Chibi-Usa she was going to act, . . . just this once, on what was in her heart instead of listening to what her intellect told her to do.<p>Setsuna saw Usa looking up at her. It was clear that the Moon Princess was a little shocked by the sheer depth of Pluto's anger and hatred. Why the younger girl was so shocked she didn't know, surely Usa knew how much Michiru and Hotaru meant to her. They were her family. True she wasn't either's lover, but love them both she did, with all her heart. The only bond, the only feelings in her heart that rivaled her love for her family was the duty she had to serve Usagi/Serenity.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Chibi-Usa was hanging on to Pluto's arm for dear life,. She had seen to much of her friend Pu-chan to ever believe that Pluto was the "emotionless bitch" her reputation painted her to be, but even she was surprised by the sheer depth of Pluto's anger. She had never seen the senshi of Pluto so close to loosing control, never seen the implacable look in her eyes that said "To Hell with everything else." She had never ever seen such a total lack of control over her emotions as Pluto was exhibiting now.<p>Usa held on desperately, she knew that if she let go Setsuna would cut loose and do something that she would (eventually) come to regret. Even with her "knowledge of what was to come" she didn't know why she had to stop Pluto from blasting the boy. To be honest she wanted to do the same. But despite her craving for vengeance Usa knew that she had to keep Pluto under control . . . she just hoped that she could.<p>To say that Setsuna was mad was like saying it got cold on Pluto. The words were true, but failed to convey the full weight of the truth they gave. Chibi-Usa had never seen her friend and mentor quite so angry . . . no enraged. Setsuna was positively livid, but somehow Setsuna's anger was both cold and hot. It was like a cold so intense that it would literally burn. Usa knew that if she didn't get Pluto out of here, and out of here NOW, that the older woman was going to go ballistic on the young man that had attacked Hotaru and Michiru. Usa only hoped that if Pluto got free that the boys end would be quick . . . and to judge by the look in her friend's eyes she doubted that he would be so lucky.<p>Usa felt hot tears of her own flowing freely from her own eyes as she considered the situation. Michiru was hurt, badly hurt and she wasn't transformed so her healing magic would not be kicking in to help. Even before the strange boy had arrived and attacked she had been in bad shape, his attack only made things worse. The Senshi of Neptune's arm was obviously broken and from the sound of the old guys last attack so was her leg. Usa knew that she would hear the sound of that final exchange, hear the sickening sound of breaking bones in her dreams for a long time to come.<p>Then to make matters worse she had been attacked again. True, Michiru dropped her attacker in his tracks, but she had no more than fired off that strange attack when she collapsed. Usa didn't know what the heck a Shishi Hokoudan was, in all the training she and the other Senshi had endured under Neptune rigorous training, she had never seen that attack before. Whatever it was it had drained her completely as Michiru had fallen bonelessly to the ground as soon as the sickly green attack had hit. It was as if the attack had drained her completely, emptying her vast reserves of energy in one final act of retribution. Nodoka had moved quickly to Michiru's side and began checking looking her over, only to be pushed gently aside by the young girl with blue hair.<p>Hotaru, well she didn't know how her best friend was doing either. The attack she had interrupted had been devilishly powerful. It looked like the boy had tried to pull his attack, but if he had he hadn't been able to do so completely. Usa still heard the sickening sound the blow had made when it hit. The blow had tossed Hotaru several yards away, where she had landed in a broken heap. Hotaru's arms and legs were splayed out awkwardly and she was lying very, very still. Hotaru looked like a broken doll carelessly thrown on a trash heap, and she hadn't moved since the impact, nor had she made a single sound, not even a moan of pain.<p>Despite her concern for her "mama" and friend, Usa remembered her instructions from future Pluto and clung to them like a lifeline. Pluto's final words to her before sending her back had been simple and direct.<p>"Don't interfere. They will be okay."<p>Future Pluto had spoken the words calmly, almost emotionlessly, but even Usa had noticed the pain in Pluto's eyes, a pain that still lingered even after so many years. It hadn't even registered until know that Pluto had said "they'll" be okay instead of "Michiru" will be okay.<p>No matter how much she wanted to fly to her friend's side, no matter how worried she was or became Pluto's words still echoed forcefully in her mind. "Don't interfere." These words had been repeated several times by Pluto before she had been allowed to come back to the past. Indeed they were the last words Usa had heard before taking the trip back, one final admonition, a final promise extracted to leave things alone and to prevent "past" Pluto from interfering as well.<p>Usa wanted to go to her friend's aid, but instead she had to fight against those urges and she had to get Setsuna to leave. Leaving her friends behind was going to be the hardest thing she had ever done, harder than fighting, harder than keeping secrets she so wanted to tell the others, harder than anything she had ever done.<p>"We can't interfere Pu-chan, we can't," Usa whispered brokenly, not once relinquishing or even letting up on her grip. "No matter how much we want to."<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Setsuna spat on the ground, anger filling her heart, filling it as she considered her options. She could ignore Chibi-Usa and drop a Dead Scream on the bastard who had hurt her friends or she could ignore what was in her heart and leave. It was a tough choice, but one that she was going to have to make.<p>Setsuna sighed and pushed her rage away, then turned back to the meadow and stared at her friends with a final pain filled gaze before relenting. To her relief she saw that both Michiru and Hotaru were being attended to. The auburn haired woman who looked so much like Michiru was kneeling beside the Senshi of Neptune and watching as the youngest member of the other group was kneeling by Michiru's side. To Pluto's amazement she saw a bluish glow emanating from the girl's hands, and a look of peace come across Michiru's pain contorted features. Hotaru wasn't being ignored either, a short distance away the older man was checking on her. His face was concerned, but his expression was intent and focused, not hopeless, as he checked the young girl's vital signs. His expression gave Setsuna some hope that all would be well.<p>Slumping in resignation Setsuna turned back to Chibi-Usa. Duty warred with her heart's desire, and as usual for the Senshi of Pluto, duty won, though the battle was close and hard fought. Pluto followed her mind instead of her heart and teleported out taking Chibi-Usa with her.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>A single heartbeat later the pair reappeared. This time instead of finding themselves in an unfamiliar woods gazing into a brightly lit, but somehow still dark meadow, they arrived in the living room of her home. These were surroundings that normally brought comfort and a sense of love to the weary senshi of Pluto, a place that normally filled her with peace, but right now peace was hard to find and was far from either's mind.<p>"Small Lady, I think its time we had a talk," Setsuna growled.<p>The normally calm and imperturbable Sailor Pluto was a mess. Silver tracks glistened brightly on her face showing where her tears had so uncharacteristically flowed. Normally Meiou Setsuna was as hard to read as a Los Vegas cardsharp, but right now the expression on her lovely face was so easy to read a child could have done so. Of course a child seeing the look of anger writ so large and clear would likely run after a single glance. Right now Setsuna's fear and anguish was written across her face with a bold hand and as clearly read as the guilt on the face of a child caught with her hand in the cookie jar. Setsuna's red eyes glowed with barely suppressed anger as she pondered the events she had seen.<p>What she wanted to do was go back, to leave Chibi-Usa here and return to that meadow now that Usa had finally released the iron grip she had on her arm. She knew she could teleport before Usa had a chance to grab her again, and Pluto desperately wanted do so. She wanted to go and find the boy that had struck down her daughter, who had in a blind rage attacked her friend. As a result her mask of calm was gone and what was left in its place was anger and rage. Few looking at her now would be able to meet her eyes at all, and even fewer would be able to do so without fear.<p>The current recipient of her glare was no different than most. Despite their long friendship, at the moment she could see that even Chibi-Usa had difficulty meeting her fiery gaze.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Chibi-Usa shuddered at the intensity of Setsuna's released emotions. The young neo princess had heard the expression "If looks could kill," but this was the first time that she ever thought the saying might actually be true.<p>"What do you want to know Pu-chan?" Usa questioned softly, sadness and more than a little resignation in her voice.<p>"I want to know just what the HELL is going on . . . I want to know everything that you do. I want to know why Michiru was there. I want to know why that old man was calling her "boy" and "Ranma" I want to know everything you know." Setsuna's voice trembled with emotion as she spoke, though hints of calm were even now returning to it.<p>"I still can't tell you everything," Usa evaded. Seeing the impatience in the older woman's eyes the young neo-princess quickly continued. "Didn't you say that you were going to meet yourself at the Time Gates later? "<p>"Yes I did," Pluto answered, "But not until after the meeting at Rei's."<p>"Then I can't. You will tell yourself what you need to know."<p>Pausing for a moment to take several deep breaths Pluto continued. "You said Hotaru and Michiru were going to be okay. Are you sure about that? They weren't transformed so . . . "<p>"Yes Pu-chan I am sure," Usa interrupted confidently. "The Masaki's will take good care of them. Despite how it looked neither was hurt so badly that they'll be down for long."<p>"Are you sure? I mean Happosai broke her arm and probably her leg and that final attack Michiru used apparently drained her completely." Pluto questioned hesitantly. "And from the looks of things Hotaru probably has some broken ribs as well. I mean that guy knocked her flying with that umbrella he used."<p>So caught up in their conversation were the two senshi that they neglected to take a close look at their surroundings. Pluto had teleported them back home, to the only real sanctuary she had outside of her palace/quarters on Pluto. Neither woman had bothered to take note of who else might be present. They had been lucky that Haruka wasn't home when they arrived. Their attention for the moment was focused on their pain and on each other that they hadn't noticed that fact, but their luck was about to take a turn for the worse. Neither noticed the sound of the front door being opened.<p>* * * * * * * * * * *<p>Haruka was bored. School had been the usual, go to class, take notes, try to stay awake. Nothing strange or unusual had happened all day, no youma, no demons (or whatever those things were last night) nor any other enemy had shown up. All in all a rather boring day . . . and to make matters worse she had spent it alone. It still surprised her just how much Michiru's presence meant to her. Even boring days were more tolerable when she was with her lover, even when absolutely nothing was going on Michiru's mere presence made things better.<p>After school she had gone to the racetrack. She had hoped spending some time there would relieve the boredom, but even her love for racing and the speed induced high she normally experienced when racing hadn't helped. It seemed that nothing could hold her attention today. Even on the racetrack her mind was on her lover . . . and that wasn't good. Haruka was an experienced racer and knew just how quickly an accident could happen, when moving at the speeds she was used to concentration on the track and car was paramount.<p>Haruka knew that the others often considered her oblivious to anything that didn't involve, racing, fighting, Michiru or Hotaru, but that wasn't quite true. She might not be on the same level as Ami, Michiru or Setsuna intellectually, but that didn't mean she was clueless. She knew that there was still more that Michiru was holding back, there was still something (or several something's) lurking in the deepest recesses of her lover's mind, some secret she wasn't quite ready to share. Something that even now Michiru was afraid to tell her. Despite the revelations of the previous evening and the comfort they had given each other, Michiru was still afraid . . . and that worried the blond more than the prospect of a fight . . . and hurt her as well. Michiru was normally impervious to fear, somehow managing to make her way through even the worst of fights with a serenity, a focus that had to be seen to be believed. To see her so . . . unsure . . . of herself was troubling.<p>Even after she had "come clean" about her relationship with Saotome Nodoka, Haruka could sense that there were secrets Michiru still held inside. While she couldn't explain how she knew that in words that would make sense, Haruka knew that it was true.<p>The senshi of Uranus sighed as she parked her car and headed toward the house. She trusted Michiru, trusted her with her life and her love. For now she'd just have to be patient and hope that the other woman would be ready to talk, and hopefully soon. She hated being in the dark . . . but even more than that she hated to see the fear in Michiru's expressive blue eyes. Haruka loved Michiru with all her heart and when Michiru was in pain she felt it as well.<p>Haruka opened the door to her home and walked in . . . just in time to hear Setsuna's pain filled voice.<p>"Are you sure they'll be okay? I mean Happosai broke her arm and probably her leg and that final attack Michiru used apparently drained her completely." Pluto questioned hesitantly. "And from the looks of things Hotaru probably has some broken ribs as well. I mean that guy knocked her flying with that umbrella he used."<p>The words took a moment to sink in. What the hell was Setsuna talking about. Michiru hurt, how? All Michiru had planned for today was going to see some of her old teachers today. Why would she be hurt . . . unless of course she had run into more demons. But if that were true why did Setsuna call "him" by name. If she had been in a fight why hadn't Michiru she transformed? True even transformed they weren't invulnerable, but they were exponentially harder to hurt than when in their "civilian" form . . . and why was Hotaru with her. Haruka knew that neither had called for help, neither had used their communicators to advise anyone that they were in a fight. Not only that but Hotaru was supposed to be in school today! No one had said anything about Hotaru going anywhere with Michiru today.<p>"What the HELL are you talking about Setsuna?" Haruka snarled interrupting any further conversation between the two women.<p>If her lover or her daughter were hurt she was going to drop a load of hurt on who or whatever injured them.<p>"Eeeppp," Chibi-Usa jumped, then groaned. If things weren't already tough enough trying to keep Pu-chan from doing something that could mess with the time-stream, now Haruka was involved . . . and Haruka tended to be a bit . . . extreme in her reactions to problems.<p>Haruka watched as Chibi-Usa's expression moved from surprise, to guilt, then worry. It was Setsuna's expression that startled her the most though.  The normally impassive mask the woman habitually wore was gone, fear and anguish shone as clearly as a full moon on a cloudless night. Not only that but it was clear from the silvery tracks down her cheeks that she had been crying. Haruka felt a lump growing in her throat, and a sick uneasy feeling in her stomach, Setsuna was crying. She never thought she would see the day when that would happen. Whatever had happened had clearly thrown the older woman for a loop . . . and that fact alone was enough to positively terrify Haruka. She had seen Sailor Pluto stare Death straight in the face with without blinking. She had seen Pluto die showing less emotion showing than she was displaying right now.<p>"Haruka . . . "Setsuna began, her voice hoarse from crying and cracking from suppressed pain, "Michiru has been hurt."<p>"I got that part Setsuna," Haruka interrupted impatiently and in a voice laced with sarcasm. "What I want to know is how and where she is now."<p>""I'll get to that if you'll let me," Setsuna snapped, faint traces of her "normal" self coming through in her tone.<p>"Michiru wasn't going to see her music sensei. Apparently she had a different kind of meeting in mind," Setsuna spoke slowly, the need to calm her rather explosive friend being just what she needed to allow her to regain control over her own emotions.<p>Haruka paused consideringly at her companion's words, then nodded with a sharp jerky motion of her head. Trying to recall just what Michiru had told her Haruka nodded again, this time with a touch less anger. Michiru hadn't exactly said she was going to see her musical instructors, she had only said that she didn't think Haruka would want to meet "her sensei." Haruka knew that Michiru very seldom out and out lied. Hell she usually didn't have to. Like Setsuna, Michiru was a master at telling the truth in such a way that the listener heard what she expected to hear . . . and not a thing more.<p>"Go on,"<p>"Well, she . . . she apparently was meeting with one of her former martial arts instructors."<p>"Oh, so they were sparring and there was an accident?" Haruka answered with relief.<p>"No, not exactly," Again Setsuna spoke slowly, carefully choosing her words.<p>"What do you mean 'not exactly?'" Haruka pressed.<p>"Apparently she had a . . . disagreement . . . with one of her former sensei. She met him as part of a formal duel."<p>"A DUEL!" Haruka yelled. "What the HELL are you talking about? Why would Michiru duel anyone, and why the HELL didn't she tell me?"<p>The green haired Senshi of Time looked down, unable for once to meet Haruka's angry gaze.<p>"I don't know why . . . at least not with any certainty. My future self told me when and where the fight was to take place and that I was supposed to take Hotaru and Chibi-Usa. I didn't tell myself anything more than that."<p>"You took Hotaru with you? Why her and not me?" this time it was Haruka's voice that resounded with hurt. "Did Michiru tell you to leave me out of this?"<p>"NO! It's nothing like that." This time it was the diminutive moon princess who answered. "Michiru didn't even know we were there. At least she didn't until Hotaru ran out into the meadow where Michiru was."<p>"YOU!" Haruka growled and shot Chibi-Usa a venomous look. Normally Haruka actually liked Chibi-Usa, after all she was one of Hotaru's closest friends. "What do you know about this?"<p>Chibi-Usa forced herself to meet Haruka's fiery eyes.<p>"More than I am allowed to say right now," She answered softly, guilt riding in her voice. "I didn't know that Hotaru was going to get hurt though."<p>"Dammit Usa!" Haruka cursed. "You knew Michiru was going to be hurt and you didn't . . . "<p>"Haruka, I couldn't do anything," Chibi-Usa was nearly in tears. "Don't you think I would have if I could?"<p>Ignoring Usa's tears Haruka turned her eyes back to Setsuna she continued. "I see that she's been hanging around you too long." Haruka stated flatly, ice crackling in her voice. "I suppose that you didn't tell me because you were afraid I'd mess with the time-stream."<p>"I know it won't make you feel any better Haruka," Setsuna began softly, "But apparently I didn't even trust myself enough to tell me anything ahead of time. I had no idea what was going to happen. I didn't even know there was going to be a fight until it was to late . . . and I still don't know what is going on. I'm supposed to meet me at the Time Gates after our meeting at Rei's today."<p>The blond senshi snorted. "You're right, that doesn't help."<p>Fighting her anger Haruka speared both of the other women with a gimlet glare. "Fine then what CAN you tell me."<p>This time it was Chibi-Usa who responded. "All I can tell you right now is that Michiru had a formal due with someone named Happosai. Terms were discussed before the fight. Apparently Happosai has trained Michiru in unarmed combat. She did something to make him mad and as a result he denied her the right to practice his style, for any reason," she emphasized, "At least until she beat him in a duel. They met today for that duel . . . "<p>"And," Haruka prodded when Chibi-Usa trailed off.<p>"They fought." Pluto chimed in. "I knew that Michiru was quite good from watching her grow up, far better than she ever let on. I knew that she wasn't showing us even a small fraction of her skill. What I didn't know was why she was acting this way. Until today it really hasn't mattered as we've managed to beat all of our opponents anyway. I figured that sooner or later we'd find out what was going on, but I never expected it to be like this."<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"Haruka," Setsuna hesitated, she knew how much her fighting skills meant to the blond senshi. She knew how much pride Haruka took in being the best fighter among the senshi. "Michiru is one of the best martial artists I've ever seen."<p>To say that Haruka was stunned would be to say that the sun was hot, a massive understatement if ever there was one.<p>"One of the best you've ever seen?" she stuttered.<p>"Yes. The man she fought was incredible too. He is apparently the Grandmaster of his style."<p>"A Grandmaster? Haruka puzzled, "And you say that Michiru fought him?"<p>"Yes, Not only did she fight him . . . she won!"<p>"Michiru beat a Grandmaster?" Haruka murmured with more than a little shock in her voice, "I take it she was using a bokken."<p>"No Haruka," Usa picked up the conversation. "They both fought unarmed."<p>The senshi of Uranus felt her jaw drop open. If this were an anime she knew her jaw would be hitting the floor right about now. When were the surprises going to stop? She had just yesterday learned that her lover was a sword master, probably a Grandmaster of her style, and now she had defeated a Grandmaster of unarmed combat as well . . . and beat him in his own art. Haruka felt her mind slipping toward overload and shutdown. Then a light dawned on her.<p>"Did you say Anything Goes?"<p>"Yes I did, why?" Setsuna answered.<p>"I've heard of that style. There was an article in one of my magazines about it a few months ago. It's a family art and is supposed to be one of the deadliest styles around. How in Kami's name did she learn it?" She paused for a moment before continuing. "Dammit, I remember now. Two families practice that style the Tendo family and the Saotome family. She must have learned it from Nodoka!"<p>"I don't know if that's right or not." Pluto answered honestly. "I monitored all of you while you were growing up and I never saw her with anyone who looked like the guy she fought today. The only Art I saw her practice with Saotome Nodoka was the sword."<p>Haruka growled with frustration. "I think she and I are going to have a little talk about all of this. I'm more than a little tired of all the secrets that she's kept from me . . . from us," Haruka added after a moments consideration. "I've had just about had it up to here with all these secrets." Then under her breath, so softly the that the others could barely make out the words she continued, "Why didn't she trust me with this, why?"<p>Shaking her head Haruka paused then tried to push her worries aside for the moment.<p>"So where is she . . . and what happened to Hotaru?"<p>"They're with some friends of Michiru's," Chibi-Usa answered hesitantly. "But we can't go see them right now." She finished quickly seeing the look of determination in Haruka's eyes.<p>"WHY NOT?" Haruka ground her words out.<p>"Because we can't, I can't tell you more than that right now. Maybe after we talk to Michiru and Hotaru we'll know more," Usa answered firmly. "Future Pluto told me that none of us could see the Masaki's or make contact with them yet. Don't worry, she also told me that everything will both be fine."<p>Haruka literally snarled as she pointed to the couch. "Both of you sit. I want to know everything that you are "allowed" to tell me," The irritation in her voice at the restriction was clear, as was her anger at her helplessness.<p>"Well, its like this," Setsuna began. "We followed Michiru to the home of Saotome Nodoka. She went in and spent about an hour there. When she came out she was dressed strangely. She was wearing boys clothes, in a Chinese style and for some reason they were to big for her."<p>"Yeah," Usa interjected, "There were at least two sizes to big. Not only that but she had died her hair red."<p>"That's her natural color," Haruka interjected absently. "I don't know why she changed it. I mean she'd look really hot as a redhead," Haruka paused for a moment imagining he lover with fiery red hair instead of the cool blue color she preferred. "Go on."<p>"Well from there we killed some time at the mall. When it was time I teleported us to the location my future self told me to go to. At that time I still didn't know why we were going there. We waited about half an hour, then Grandmaster Happosai arrived with another woman. Hotaru called her Kasumi and said she was the woman that they had gone to see in Nerima yesterday."<p>Seeing the look of jealousy growing in Haruka's expressive blue eyes, Setsuna quickly continued.<p>"Not long after that Michiru arrived with a group of other people. Saotome Nodoka was one of them, there was also a Shinto Priest, a boy and six other girls with them. They were a strange looking group as they all had rather . . . unique hair colors as well, not a single brunette or black haired one in the bunch. In fact one had hair almost he same shade as Michiru's normal color," Setsuna mused. "Then Nodoka and the Priest followed Michiru into the clearing, the others stopped at the edge where Kasumi joined them.  Michiru talked to Happosai for a while, setting the terms of the duel." Setsuna paused with a puzzled look on her face.<p>Haruka nodded, then motioned for Setsuna to continue.<p>"That was a strange conversation let me tell you. For some reason Happosai kept calling her "boy". I think he called her "Ranma" once or twice, and the terms were rather weird as well."<p>"What was strange about them?" Haruka prodded.<p>"Welllll, Michiru basically promised to do a porn layout for him and to move in with him for a week if she lost." Setsuna answered hesitantly.<p>"She DID WHAT?" Haruka yelled.<p>"She agreed to pose for him in lingerie and to even allow him to take some nude photographs of her."<p>"I don't believe it! Why the hell would she agree to that? Did she look like she was drugged or under a spell?" Haruka was more than a little puzzled when she heard those terms.<p>Haruka knew how much Michiru hated it when boys came on to her. Why would she agree to terms like that? The only thing that Haruka could think of was that either Michiru was confident she would win, (which didn't make sense if she was fighting a Grandmaster), or that the match was so important to her that she was willing to risk paying even that price if she lost.<p>"We didn't believe it either, and no she didn't appear to be drugged or anything. I thought Hotaru was going to blow a gasket when she heard the terms. But Michiru agreed. If she won agreed to license her to use and teach his style and to, as she put it, he had to 'Leave her the Hell alone'. They talked for a few more minutes then the fight started."<p>Setsuna took a few minutes to give a rather detailed account of the fight. She still found Michiru's skill level hard to believe, and to judge from the look on Haruka's face she wasn't the only one with that problem. Setsuna watched as pride warred with disbelief on Haruka's expressive face as she listened. Haruka's expression darkened as she listened to Setsuna describe the final moments of the fight. Her expression turned to one of fury when the attack by the stranger was described . . . and to one of unadulterated rage when she found out how Hotaru was injured.<p>"I'm going to find that bastard and kill him!" This time the words were not yelled, they were spoken softly, almost reverently, but with a cold passion that left no doubt in either listener's mind that Haruka was indeed likely to try and kill the boy if she ever found him.<p>"You can't." Usa interjected firmly. "And no I don't know why."<p>"That son of a bitch deserves to die for what he did." Haruka argued.<p>"Maybe he does, but not by your hands, Pluto told me that I was to make sure that Michiru handled it. " Chibi-Usa met Uranus's angry eyes with her own. She wanted revenge nearly as much as the others, but she also knew that such was not to be . . . at least not yet.<p>"Fine," the snarl was back in Haruka's voice. "I know Michiru and she won't take it lightly that someone hurt Hotaru."<p>"No she won't," both Setsuna and Usa agreed shuddering. While Michiru was normally as calm a person as you'd ever run into, when she finally did get mad . . . brrrrrr she was SCARY.<p>"She's already exacted some revenge. I don't know what she did, but the attack she used dropped him like a pole-axed steer." Chibi-Usa stated with more than a little satisfaction. "He won't be getting up for quite a while."<p>"So what can we do in the meantime? Can't we at least call and make sure they are okay?" Haruka uncharacteristically pleaded.<p>Chibi-Usa thought for a moment then nodded her assent. "I think we can do that much at least."<p>Usa headed over to the phone and quickly dialed, her fingers flashing over the buttons with the ease of long practice.<p>Setsuna and Haruka exchanged measuring looks. It seemed that Chibi-Usa hadn't yet told them all that she knew. The neo-princess hadn't looked up the number or even referred to any notes. She had dialed it as if it were a familiar number she used often. Since she wouldn't be using a telephone when she was in Crystal Tokyo, that must mean that she knew (or would know) them here in the present. Both women listened closely as she spoke into the phone eager to gain news of their family . . . and just as eager to glean additional facts from Chibi-Usa if she made any more mistakes.<p>"Hello, May I speak to Masaki Katsuhito?"<p>There was a long pause then Usa spoke again, introducing herself as a friend of Michiru and Hotaru and asking about her friends' condition. There was a long pause, then Usa smiled, relief flooding her face as she hung up the phone.<p>"He said they are doing fine," Chibi-Usa smiled, "and they should be up and around tomorrow."<p>Haruka felt a myriad of emotions at the news. Relief was mingled with anger and some hurt as well. She felt relief that her family was going to be fine. She was angry that they had been hurt and desperately wanted to go find and "chastise" the one that had injured her family. Haruka was also feeling a bit hurt that she had been excluded from today's events, and even more disappointed that the most important people in her life had kept secrets from her, secrets that had let them get hurt . . . when she might have been able to prevent it.<p>The revelations of the last two days were beginning to take their toll and the blond senshi. She wondered what was going to happen to her family. Were things ever going to return to "normal?"<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>The woman formerly known as Saotome Nodoka paced restlessly, for once her normally serene expression replaced by one of nervous worry. The girl Washu had shooed them all out of the . . . well whatever you could call the space beneath the stairs that she occupied. Of course it was clear, even to the densest of observers that the laboratory whose entrance was the closet doorway, was not really under the stairs. Where it actually was Nodoka didn't have a clue, but given its size and the amazing contents contained therein, it was not something of this Earth.<p>She looked around the living room at her companions. For the moment they were quiet, as if the events of the day were shocking even to them. Ryoko and Ayeka were hovering protectively around her "nephew" Tenchi. Little Sasami was puttering about cleaning what was already an immaculately clean room. Mihoshi and Kiyone had left saying they had to go to work. Her sensei was sitting calmly nearby, drinking tea as if nothing was wrong.<p>Nodoka still didn't know quite what to make of the situation. If the events of today had happened even two short years ago she doubted that she would be able to handle them quite so calmly. If confronted with people who were either aliens or oni she probably would've either passed out or run like the hordes of hell were after her.<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you looked at them the last two years had really opened her eyes to the strange and unusual. Given her own skills at ki manipulation and reading she had known for a years that the world view and limits that "normal" people accepted were more an illusion than a reality. Even so it was still quite a shock to discover that magic, curses and demons were real as real as the ability to use ki. However, once those truths were accepted it wasn't much of a stretch to believe in Oni or space aliens . . . though a part of her still expected them to look a little less human and more exotic than the Masakis and their friends.<p>Nodoka still wanted to know more about the situation here, just what was their relationship to her ancestor Funaho. Was it really possible that she was still alive, and that she was Katsuhito's mother. Despite her desire to find answers to these questions she remained still. Common courtesy and her duties as a guest of the Masaki family quelled her desire to ask these questions. Until they were ready to talk she would have to accept their silence. The former Saotome, now ronin, let her eyes drift to her sensei.<p>It was amazing to think that the man who had taught her the Art was from another world, that he was in fact an alien or at least half alien. She blushed as she recalled the crush that she had on Katsuhito when she was younger. Achika had loved to tease her about it. Nodoka had known that nothing would come of it of course, Katsuhito was a married man who was obviously (and completely) in love with his wife, but a girl's first crush had failed to take those things into consideration and a "first crush" was something to fondly remember.<p>"Nodoka, would you like to spar?" her musings were interrupted by the voice of her sensei.<p>Nodoka's blush grew and she mentally chastised herself for her inattention.  Lost in memories of a more pleasant time she had nearly forgotten where she was and what she was doing.<p>"Hai sensei," she answered, "But I am hardly dressed for the occasion."<p>"I believe we can take care of that," Katsuhito answered gently. "If you would follow me up to the shrine I believe I have an extra set of clothes you can use."<p>"If it would not be to much trouble sensei," Nodoka stammered, "It would help keep me occupied until Michiru recovers."<p>"That was my intention Nodoka-chan," the older man responded with a slight smile. "I hope you still remember the way."<p>"Yes sensei, I do,"<p>"Then by all means shall we go?" Turning toward Tenchi and the others he continued. "Would the rest of you like to come and observe? Tenchi I believe that you will find it most instructive."<p>"Yes grandfather. We will meet you there in a few minutes."<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>The silence after Katsuhito and Nodoka's departure was broken by a soft chiming giggle from Sasami.<p>"What are you laughing at sister?" Ayeka asked, turning her attention away from Tenchi and toward her younger sibling.<p>"Just that Aunty Nodoka was looking at Grandfather the same way that you and Ryoko look at Tenchi."<p>"What are you talking about Sasami?" Tenchi questioned.<p>"I think Aunty has a crush on grandfather," Sasami giggled again. "Didn't you see the way she kept sneaking looks at him?"<p>"I think you are seeing things that aren't there Sasami. Aunty Nodoka was his student and she knows him, she doesn't know anyone else here but me." Tenchi responded, hesitating before he continued. "Are you sure?"<p>Despite her apparent youth the young Jurian Prince knew that Sasami was extremely perceptive. If she said she saw something she may well have. He was used to her picking up on subtle clues, seeing things the others were to unable to see, and if it were Tsunami speaking . . . .<p>"You know, she did say that she had divorced her husband," Washu noted with an impish grin. "She also said that he had been gone with her son for over ten years, and that when he finally returned to Japan he did not return to her, so she's been alone for over ten years."<p>This time the other's noticed the stress that the childlike genius placed on the word son.<p>"Why do you keep saying that Little Washu?" Ayeka asked.<p>"Saying what Ayeka?" Washu asked innocently.<p>"It's the way you keep saying son. It sounds as if you know something that we don't. It almost sounds like you are hinting that she doesn't have a son," Ryoko agreed.<p>"Well, for the moment that's for me to know and for you to wonder about," Washu's impudent grin just dared the others to challenge her. Knowing the diminutive genius this was a challenge that none were eager to accept. Washu wasn't wrong often, and who knows what could happen if Washu was feeling mischievous. "But to get back to the topic at hand, I think Sasami's right."<p>"I don't know Washu. She was a friend of mother's and he's known her since she was a child. She's so much younger than grandfather that I don't really think that he sees her in that way."<p>"Maybe, maybe not. But I noticed that your "old" grandfather was watching her awfully closely as well . . . and the look in his eyes reminded me more of your father than his usual 'I'm a wise old priest' expression," Washu retorted. "Besides, even though he looks old we all know that Yosho is just now entering his prime . . . and I don't think that he was looking at her the way a father looks at one of his daughter's friends. Unless of course we're talking about your Dad Tenchi."<p>"Yup," Sasami's soft laughter morphed into a much more adult sounding laugh, a laugh that sounded like bells. "I think Grandfather has a crush."<p>"You've got to be kidding me," Ryoko sputtered. "I didn't think the old man had it in him."<p>"She does seem to be quite the Lady," Ayeka noted, absently capitalizing the word lady. Ayeka had been more than a little impressed by the auburn haired woman. "And if she is of Aunty Funaho's line it would not be strange for him to be attracted to her. After all Aunty did catch father's attention rather dramatically and still has it even now."<p>"What is it with you Jurians and wanting to marry family," Ryoko teased. "I will admit though that she is quite a looker," Ryoko continued showing her agreement. "And if she's anything like Funaho if she decides she wants him he's in for quite a ride. He'll never know what hit him until its to late."<p>Ayeka blushed at Ryoko's choice of wording, but for once Ayeka found herself in complete agreement with her greatest rival . . . and sometimes friend.<p>"True, what Aunty Funaho wants she usually gets," she agreed.<p>"Yeah," Sasami agreed with another of her angelic giggles. "And she makes everyone else think it was their idea to begin with."<p>"That is very true Sasami," Ayeka murmured. "She's the only one who even comes close to being as devious as grandmother."<p>"I still think you guys are seeing things that aren't there," Tenchi replied, "But I have to admit I already think of her as family. She's been Aunty Nodoka ever since I can remember and if she were to . . . "<p>"Lord Tenchi," Ayeka interrupted, "If we are going to go watch them spar we should leave now."<p>"I guess you are right Ayeka," turning toward the other ladies he continued. "Shall we go?"<p>All but Washu nodded and stood preparing for the long walk to the shrine.<p>"I think I'll stay here. I want to be close by in case one of my patients need anything."<p>"Are you sure Little Washu?" Tenchi asked. "You said that hey wouldn't be out of the healing tubes until tomorrow."<p>"Yes Tenchi I'm sure," Washu affirmed. "Besides I'm getting some really interesting data on all four of my patients. It's possible that they make wake up early. I think I'll just stay here and run some more tests before they wake up. Besides, I'll send a couple of Washu-cams up to tape the bout, that way I can review that data as well."<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>When they arrived at the training area the group stopped, once again taken by surprise at the level of skill that one of the "humans" was showing. It appeared that Lady Nodoka may well be of Funaho's line to judge from the skill and power she was showing. Nodoka and Katsuhito were moving at speeds that were hard to see, both attacking and defending with a grace displayed by only the very best of fighters.<p>"Wow!" Sasami exclaimed, "She's really good. She does remind me of Aunty Funaho!"<p>The young princess said thinking about a few of the training sessions she had seen between her own mother Misaki and Aunty Funaho. Funaho might be the Minister of Information, but she more than knew how to take care of herself in a fight. Even Misaki had her hands full when Funaho went full out.<p>"Yeah," Ryoko agreed. "She's giving Yosho a real run for his money."<p>The group settled in to watch as the pair dueled. The action taking place was very interesting, but even more so to the observers was the look of contentment on the both warriors' faces as they battled. Both were intent, looking for any opening that would give them an advantage, yet at the same time they seemed to be lost in their shared passion.<p>"You know, Sasami might be right," Tenchi whispered. "I haven't seen grandfather act like this or look so happy since grandmother died," he finished with a sad tone.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Usagi's late again." Rei fumed, looking at the assembled senshi.<p>The mood for this meeting was far from normal. Makoto and Minako were sitting together as was usual, but what wasn't normal was the serious look on their faces, and the fact that they weren't talking about boys. Ami was hunched over the Mercury Computer, that was as expected, but the grim look on her face as she looked at the screen was something the rest normally only saw when she was in the midst of a pitched battle. When Ami looked that serious it meant only one thing . . . a new enemy and trouble with a capital T.<p>Rei continued her rant. "I mean Usagi's always late. That's normal for her, but where are Haruka, Chibi-Usa, Hotaru and Setsuna? This meeting is important. I did a fire reading last night . . . "Rei shuddered at the memory of her close call with the demon. Pushing aside her fears for the moment she continued. ". . . and I've got a lot to tell you all."<p>"I've been doing some research as well. I think I can shed some light on what we saw yesterday. I'm afraid though that the information leads to more questions than it gives answers." Ami noted.<p>"That still doesn't tell me where Pluto and the others are," Rei snarled. "Just once I'd like Usagi to be on time, and I still don't know why the others are late."<p>"I don't know either. I mean Pluto shows up whenever she wants, but she did say she'd be here today." Ami answered. "It is a bit out of character for her to be late when she says she'll be here."<p>"Who say's I'm late?"<p>Rei jumped as a voice spoke from behind her.<p>"Dammit Pluto, DON'T do that," she yelped in surprise.<p>Still there was something in Setsuna's voice that didn't sound right. Rei started to turn, but before she could even begin her action she noticed the looks in the other Scout's eyes . . . and to judge from their expressions what they were feeling wasn't amusement at her predicament. No it looked more like shock to judge from their wide eyes and pale faces.<p>Cautiously Rei turned, then about went into cardiac arrest. If there was one constant in the universe, it was that Meiou Setsuna in either guise was always calm and collected. Even in the worst of circumstances the Senshi of Pluto never seemed to let anything bother her, nothing ever broke her icy demeanor. What Rei saw now took the "ice bitch" image and shattered it irrevocably. Setsuna's eyes were red and puffy not to mention she had what looked like tear tracks on both of her cheeks. That was bad enough, but what drew the senshi of Mar's attention was the anger radiating from her crimson eyes.<p>Rei swallowed, fortunately the anger did not appear to be directed at any of them. One thought was clear in her mind. She did NOT want to be whoever had pissed Pluto off so badly. What made matters worse was that the same expression was mirrored on the faces of Haruka and even Chibi-Usa.  Before she could react, before she could utter a single word she was interrupted by a blond hurricane.<p>"Sorry I'm late guys." Usagi apologized as she ran into the room, pausing only long enough to kick off her shoes and replace them with house slippers. "Have I missed . . . "Usagi stopped the rapid flow of words as she took in the scene before her.<p>"Setsuna, Haruka, Chibi-Usa . . . are you guys alright?"<p>You could say a lot of derogatory things about Usagi. She didn't do well in school, her manners when eating were atrocious, she was often the very picture of a "ditzy blond". But there was one thing that outweighed all her other faults, Usagi cared. When a friend hurt so did she, and she would do anything and everything in her power to make the hurt go away.<p>"Yes Princess we are fine,"<p>"Speak for yourself Pluto," Haruka growled. "When I find out who hurt Michiru and Hotaru I'm gonna kill him. Not to mention the fact that I'm going to have a little talk with Michiru, and Hotaru when they get back." Turning toward Chibi-Usa she continued. "And don't think you are off the hook either little girl." The ice in Haruka's voice dropped the rooms temperature at least twenty degrees by the end of her statement.<p>"Why what's going on?" the words were slightly different from each of the speakers and the result of everyone trying to talk at once was a bunch of gibberish that hadn't been heard since the Tower of Babel.<p>"Michiru and Hotaru were hurt earlier today in a fight," Chibi-Usa answered. "Don't worry though they are going to be fine," the young princess answered with all the assurance she could muster.<p>"What happened? Why didn't they call for help?" Rei beat the others to the punch with her question.<p>"They weren't fighting monsters," Setsuna answered this time. "It was a martial arts duel."<p>"A WHAT?" once again the cry was near unanimous as the Inner Senshi digested the news, but so uniform was their surprise that this time the words were virtually identical, and as a result understandable.<p>"A martial arts duel," Setsuna repeated. "And before you ask, No I don't know why. No I can't tell you anything more, and No the topic is not up for further discussion until Michiru gets back."<p>"How did Hotaru get involved?" Usagi pressed.<p>"She was injured by accident," Chibi-Usa responded calmly, looking for all the world like a mirror image of Setsuna. "And like I said they are both going to be okay. They should be back tomorrow."<p>"Well if they are going to be okay and back home tomorrow they couldn't have been hurt to badly," Makoto mused.<p>Setsuna and Chibi-Usa's flinches went virtually unnoticed, and after a short pause the meeting continued.<p>"I think we need to sit down and discuss just what's been going on over the last few days." Usagi stated with more than a touch of authority, for once taking firm control over the gathered senshi. "I don't like the fact that there are so many secrets floating about, not to mention the new enemy we fought last night. I really think we need to share what we've learned and work out a proper response."<p>Dead silence greeted Usagi's statement. They all knew that the bubbly blond was eventually going to turn into their Queen, into a woman who would oversee the entire solar system and create a kingdom that whose rule was enlightened far beyond anything that existed presently. But, it was often too easy for them to forget this fact given Usagi's usual bubbly absentminded demeanor. Every once in a while though she showed them glimpses of what was to come, and today she had done so once again.<p>"Usagi's right." Ami offered timidly. "The next question is who goes first."<p>"I think Rei should go first. She said she had learned a great deal from her fire reading last night," Usagi directed.<p>All eyes turned to the fiery senshi waiting to hear her words with an anticipation that was mixed with dread.<p>Uncharacteristically Rei swallowed nervously. What she had learned was perplexing and more than a little frightening. Fighting the Dark Kingdom, the forces of the Negaverse was one thing . . . but actually fighting the forces of Hell, well that was something else entirely.<p>"Well, given what we saw Michiru do with the sword yesterday, and how strangely she was acting I concentrated on that first," Rei began. "I received . . . well, a Kami came in answer to my prayers."<p>"A Kami!" Makoto was the first to recover from the surprise this statement brought. "That's not normal is it?' she finished nervously.<p>"No it's not," Rei answered firmly, "but it was real. Now if you'll let me continue without interruptions I'll try to tell you all what I saw."<p>"Sorry Rei," Makoto apologized, "I'll try."<p>"Well, I saw Michiru going through some kata's, but what was strange was there was a handsome boy right behind her. Everything she did he mirrored, move for move. When they were done . . . "Rei paused looking nervously at Haruka. "He hugged her and then gave her a kiss."<p>"HE WHAT!" Haruka erupted, disbelief and worry coloring her tone.<p>The blond senshi found her fears from the night before being resurrected from the shallow grave that she had buried them in. Was Michiru attracted to boys? It didn't seem possible, but with all the secrets she had been keeping was she as sure of that fact as she once was?<p>"What KIND of kiss?" Haruka ground out, her voice somehow both icy cold and inferno hot at the same time.<p>"Uhmmm, he kissed her on the forehead, then he disappeared, It was almost like the kind of kiss a brother would give his sister," Rei answered hesitantly "It was strange, right after he kissed her he disappeared in a glowing blue cloud. The cloud surrounded Michiru then she . . . "<p>"She what?" again Haurka interrupted.<p>"I'll get to that if you'll give me a chance," Rei fired back with a touch of her normal ire."<p>Haruka grumbled, but didn't say anything understandable.<p>"The cloud soaked into her skin and disappeared. Michiru looked really sad when he disappeared."<p>The others tried to be unobtrusive as they looked at Haruka, the blond woman appeared to be in shock . . . and perhaps a bit worried to judge from the frown that marred her face.<p>"Then Michiru's clothes changed and she was wearing the garments of a samurai. It looked like she was in the middle of a sword kata. She wasn't fighting anyone and she was using a bokken instead of a real blade. Then the vision shifted again and the next thing I knew she was fighting or sparring with an old man dressed in a Shinto Priest's garb. He defeated her after a rather long fight. When it was done she bowed and smiled. It was kinda strange, it was like they were old friends or something.<p>The next thing I saw was Michiru standing in the dark, she transformed into Neptune, and this time she was wielding a katana and a wazikashi. The blades appeared to be plainly worked but of exquisite make, they were clearly the work of a master smith . . . and they both glowed blue."<p>"Who glowed blue?" Makoto interrupted with a slight blush. "Michiru, the swords or both?"<p>Rei paused consideringly. "Both I think, but the swords definitely were glowing. It was like she and the swords were "connected" in some way . . . almost like Neptune's Mirror is connected to her." Rei answered with a flash of inspiration. Then Michiru disappeared too."<p>"What did the boy look like?" Haruka ground out the question. "Do you think you would recognize him if you saw him again?"<p>"I think so." Rei answered confidently, "For once the vision was clear. Keep in mind though Haruka, I don't know if that was a vision of the past, the present or the future." Rei warned. "I couldn't get any sense of that from what I saw."<p>"What happened next was a bit odd as well. After Michiru disappeared I saw a building, a skyscraper that positively reeked of evil. It was like a dark cloud surrounded it. The building looked pretty new, but there wasn't anything unusual about it and I didn't see any signs telling me what building it was. I really don't know if I can identify it or not. What was strange was that the top floors were warded, but they weren't like anything Grandpa or I would make. These wards radiated evil, the almost pulsed with it. It was obvious that they were made by someone or something completely lost to all that is good."<p>"Evil?" Usagi questioned.<p>"Yes Evil, with a capital E. Pure absolute evil. Whoever created those wards has pretty much lost all shreds of humanity and decency. "Rei responded somberly, not a trace of humor anywhere to be found in her voice.<p>"I think . . . "the priestess paused for a heartbeat or two before continuing, "No, I KNOW, that they were written in human blood. Not only that," she paused, "it takes innocent blood from a human sacrifice to make wards like those."<p>Mars visibly shuddered as she uttered those last words. This time it took her nearly a minute before she could continue.<p>"As far as I could tell there were three different kinds of wards there. Some of them were designed to prevent detection by magical or spiritual means . . . others looked like barrier wards designed to keep people out, and the last kind were the spiritual equivalent of alarms. Anyone going through without somehow identifying themselves or nullifying the ward would alert those to whom the wards are attuned."<p>"In other words, "Rei looked each of the senshi in the eye as she continued. "They will know we are coming if we ever find and assault the place. I didn't dare risk setting them off and I didn't have time to look closer to see if I could get through at all, let alone get through without setting of the alarm. Before I could check them out any closer I was gone again. "<p>Rei's voice broke as she described the battles she had seen the Senshi fight with demons of various kinds. Worse than the fights themselves was the carnage that was inflicted upon the citizens of Tokyo, Juban in particular. She described their varied foes and told of seeing demons whose very aura could make a person sick nigh unto death . . . and whose evil surrounded them like a visible cloud of darkness. The Senshi of Mars went on to describe a Tokyo devastated by the conflict. She told of the desolation and misery she saw etched on the faces of the few remaining occupants of the city.<p>The mood was somber when she finished, brightened only a little by the words of comfort that the Kami had left her with. The goddess had made a promise to her, a promise that they could win, that they could prevent this future if they fought hard and didn't give up. Those words were comforting, but the bleak picture of what could happen weighed heavily on the spirits of the collected senshi.<p>"Setsuna, Have you seen any of this?" Usagi questioned once she was able to find her voice.<p>"No Princess. But I'm supposed to go and to talk to my future self right after the meeting. I may have more to tell after that . . . if I am allowed to," she finished with a hint of frustration in her voice. She had listened carefully to the story Rei told, and even she was shaken by what she heard.<p>"Okay, the goddess said we could win so we need to focus on that," Usagi spoke with authority. "Ami, tell us what you have learned."<p>"Computer display the holograms of Azami and Michiru." Ami began with a lecturing tone.<p>The senshi of Mercury sought for and found the strength to continue by concentrating on what she knew instead of thinking about what she feared was coming. Once again she found comfort in knowledge and facts to help her though something that would otherwise have sent her screaming to her room, never to reappear.<p>"The first thing I did as well was to look into the situation with Michiru.  It didn't take long to determine that Azami is indeed Michiru. The sword styles they use are virtually identical," She began, pointing out the similarities. "Then I confirmed that by doing a check of their features." This time the holographic images moved together until they were one, it was still possible to see both images, but it was difficult as they merged together so seamlessly.<p>"Yeah," Haruka confirmed. "Michiru told me that she was Azami. She used that name because her parents wouldn't let her compete under her own name."<p>"But why didn't she ever tell us about her skill with the sword?" Makoto pressed.<p>"Michiru said that since she didn't have a sword that would do any damage to the things we fight, that she didn't think it was all that important," Haruka responded, "To be truthful though I think she may have had some other reasons as well . . . but that was all she told me last night." Haruka finished.<p>The tone of Haruka's voice told the other senshi that now was not the time to press this particular issue further, and told them as well that Michiru was going to be in for a hot time the next time she spoke with Haruka.<p>"Okay," Ami murmured breaking the silence. "I also ran the data I'd collected on those things we fought last night. I've got good news and bad news there. Unfortunately what I learned only seems to agree with what Rei has already told us. Those things are not from the Dark Kingdom. The Mercury Computer didn't detect any energy that matched any known Negaverse pattern. The computer did find a match though. It said the demons were using something called pishogue"<p>Mercury paused again, the information she was going to impart would definitely confirm what Rei had already said.<p>"Apparently in the Silver Millennium we used to run into demons on a regular basis. At least regularly enough that the battle-mages had quite a bit of information about them. They classified this energy as being infernal in nature and only three groups of beings can use this energy. The first group is demons themselves. The second are those possessed by demons and the third are those who willingly sell their souls for the power to use it." Ami ticked off these points on her fingers as she spoke.<p>"According to the files I found helping anyone in either the first and third group is pretty much a lost cause. Demons are by their very nature evil. I could only find two instances where a demon "found the light" and turned away from their evil. In both cases the demons became warriors for the light and were turned into minor Kami by Kami-sama Himself." Seeing the incredulous looks on the faces of her companions Ami shrugged then continued.<p>"Hey, I'm only telling you what I found. The records also warned that there have been several cases where demons pretended to "repent" for the lack of a better term." Once again Ami paused an even more serious look than normal plastered on her face.<p>"In every case but the two I just mentioned it was a ruse. They eventually betrayed those that gave them a chance. The third group can also "repent" but they don't do it often. In those cases they generally die, but at least their souls aren't lost to Hell."<p>"What about the second group, you know the one's who are possessed?" Minako asked hesitantly.<p>"In that case the outcome depends on a couple of things," Ami continued. "Those who were unwillingly possessed people can be saved, "Ami stressed. "IF the demon is cast out the person usually recovers. If the person was willingly possessed the demon can be cast out by an exorcism, but in those cases both the host and the demon fight the exorcism tooth and nail. In those cases the exorcism is not always successful, when if fails you usually have to kill the host and then deal with the demon," she finished somberly.<p>"Wow!" came the united chorus from the rest of the senshi as Ami paused for breath.<p>"Yeah, wow." Ami agreed. "Unfortunately it appears that when the Senshi faced true demons they normally asked for help from either priests or battle-mages. It appears that while we can destroy demons they are tough opponents. During the Silver Millennium only Serenity and Mars could exorcise the demons from those possessed. Serenity used the Crystal, while Mars could use her skills as a priestess. The rest of us basically have to destroy them as we find them."<p>The mood of the group darkened as they considered Mercury's words. If Mercury was right, (and she usually was) if and when they ran into someone who was possessed it was more likely than not that they'd have to kill one innocent to save others . . . not something they wanted to do. Still they had faced horrendous odds before and had to make (and live with) tough decisions in the past. Ami watched with pride as she could see their resolve firming up. Each senshi knew that if they did nothing then the future Rei had seen would come to pass . . . and that they would not, could not allow.<p>"It gets worse guys," Mercury continued. "It seems that demons come in a lot of different varieties, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Other than just beating the stuffing out of them we're going to have to be ready to adapt to each new enemy as we see them," Ami brightened just a bit as she continued. "The Good news is that with experience we will learn how to tell them apart AND that each type has it's own weakness. Some are vulnerable to fire, others electricity, well you get the picture. Using the Mercury computer I'll be able to let you know pretty quickly which attacks will be the most effective now that I know where to look."<p>Ami looked around at her rather somber audience. "The bad news is that the things we ran into last night were only Type 3 demons. They weren't the strongest we are likely to face but at least they weren't the weakest either. There are demons like imps that we should be able to handle easily, but they are also sneakier and less likely to be found in a combat situation. According to the computer we can handle most of the 'Number Class' demons, and probably all the 'Name Class' demons as well. We'll just have to work as a team. If we run into the higher 'Limited Class' or 'Unlimited Class' demons however we are going to be in real trouble."<p>"Uhm Mercury, what do you mean, Number, Name, Limited and Unlimited Class?" Haruka questioned a look of anticipation mixed with worry clear on her face.<p>The senshi of Uranus was clearly looking forward to a good fight, but had enough sense to worry about the strength of her foes.<p>"Basically, 'Number Class' are lesser demons. There were classified by number Type I through Type 10. The lower the type the weaker the demon. 'Name Class' demons are rarer and they act as mid-level leaders, kinda like lower ranking officers in the JDSF. They are as I said less common, but quite a bit tougher. 'Limited Class" are like mid rank officers, you know the ones just under generals. 'Unlimited Class are the leaders, like a general or something equivalent. They can take on lesser Kami with a chance of success. If we run into them we basically need to pray for help . . . and hope the Kami are listening."<p>That bit of news put a real damper on things and a feeling of depression fell over the assembled group once again.<p>"From what information I could glean I doubt that we'll run into anything higher than a 'Name Class' demon. The mages best guess was that there are some kind of rules of engagement between Heaven and Hell which prevent direct intervention by the 'higher' powers. There were no known instances of anyone being able to summon anything higher than a 'Name Class' demon. The problem is that if the summoning isn't done right they can break free and then all Hell breaks loose . . . quite literally in fact," Ami finished.<p>Silence ruled for several minutes as the Senshi digested Ami's report.<p>"The goddess said we could win," Rei reminded the group, faith blazing clearly in her eyes. "That means that there is a way. Neither the Kami nor Heaven will abandon us to evil. We can win."<p>Then slowly, gradually, the senshi shook off their fear and began making plans.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"How was your day Kasumi? Did you enjoy your trip?" Nabiki asked, never looking up from the business section of the paper.<p>"It was okay," Kasumi managed to answer the question, but the catch in her voice grabbed her younger sister's attention.<p>"What happened sis? You don't sound like everything was okay. Happosai didn't bother you did he?"<p>Nabiki fixed her attention on her older sister and contemplated her revenge if the old pervert had done anything to upset Kasumi. Nabiki didn't really think that he had. Kasumi was just about the only woman other than Aunty Nodoka that the letch never bothered.<p>Kasumi looked terrible. To Nabiki's experienced eyes it sure looked like she'd been crying.<p>"No Happosai didn't do anything to me. A friend of ours was hurt in a fight."<p>"Was it Ranma?" Nabiki questioned eagerly, the icy mask she normally showed the world slipping and revealing instead a girl who had lost something she didn't think she valued at all, only to discover it was more important to her than she had ever realized.<p>She hadn't realized until he was gone just how much he meant to her. It had been a shock to discover he was a friend . . . and could have been more had she not been so blind. She hadn't realized just how much time he actually spent talking to her, getting to know the her that she hid behind her cold exterior. To say she had been surprised at by that realization was to severely understate the facts.<p>After he was gone Nabiki realized that the time he spent with her each day was one of the highlights in her life. After the wedding fiasco, and after he had forgiven her she had taken a hard look at herself.<p>It was then that she realized Ranma had taken the time to try to understand her, the real her. Once she spent time with him that wasn't taken up by one of her "schemes" or "scams" she had soon realized Ranma was no idiot. Underneath his "jock" image he was actually quite intelligent. Ignorant, Hell yes, he was about as ignorant as it was possible for a human being to be on some topics. But to be honest that was only to be expected given his upbringing. Nabiki had cursed her own blindness, once she got to know him better, even she had had failed to see beyond the image that he had projected.<p>He wasn't an idiot like she had pegged him. It hadn't taken her long, (once she bothered to look) to see that. Hell, he had to be smart. The boy had spent very little time in school, but somehow managed to pass all of his classes, and that while spending a good chunk of each school day either asleep or in the hall.<p>It was only after he disappeared that she realized just how many times he'd done something to lift her spirits when she was down, usually without her even knowing that was his goal. She had learned that he had a dry wit that nearly matched her own.<p>It wasn't until he was gone that she had found out he knew all along about her activities and that he let, . . . he actually let her get away with many of the schemes she had perpetrated. Sure at first he didn't have a clue, but after he'd been around a while he'd seen what she was doing, and did nothing to stop her. When Kasumi had revealed that little fact it had opened her eyes to a Ranma that she'd never let herself see. It wasn't until it was to late that she realized that he had tried to be . . . and was one of her few real friends.<p>Nabiki knew that those who were her true friends were on a very short list.  One or two of her associates, Kaiou Michiru, and a handful of others who had managed to see past her front and valued her for who she was.<p>Nabiki was curious. Most of her friends went to Furinkan with her, the only two she could think of that didn't were Ranma and Michiru. Ranma she hadn't seen in over three months . . . and the idea that Michiru was involved in a martial arts duel was ludicrous.<p>Still friends were important to her and she wanted to know who it was that was hurt. Nabiki also knew that if Ranma was going to let anyone know where he was, Kasumi was probably that person. He'd always had a soft spot in his heart for her. Nabiki grinned as she recalled the first time Ranma had called Kasumi "big sister", the look on Kasumi's face when she realized just how much he cared for her had been priceless.<p>It had to be him. Even though Michiru hadn't been around much the last couple of years she had seen her over in Juban during an occasional visit. Not only that they still kept in close contact via the internet and telephone. She'd just talked to Michiru not two days before and Michiru had said nothing about a duel. If she hadn't known Michiru studied Kempo at some point, Nabiki would never have even guessed that the girl knew anything about martial arts. Michiru's most common topic (other than her "family") was her music. Heck Michiru often made sure that Nabiki had tickets to her concerts. One of Nabiki's few pleasures was to dress up and go listen to her friend perform. Michiru's only condition on the tickets was that they were never to be sold, only used by her and Kasumi or given away. It was a condition that Nabiki had never broken, not even when money was the tightest.<p>Michiru was also amazingly good at listening and giving advice when needed.  She never failed to listen when Nabiki was feeling down, never turned her away when she needed to vent about her problems. No Michiru would listen, carefully, think about whatever the problem was and give (generally) well considered advice. The only area that Michiru consistently failed to give advice on was boys . . . and given her preferences Nabiki guessed she could understand that. One of the few times that Michiru had shocked her was when Nabiki had admitted a growing attraction to Ranma. In that one particular case Michiru had made it clear that she didn't think that a relationship with him would work out. The strange thing about that conversation was the undertone of sadness in Michiru's voice when she found out that Nabiki was interested in Ranma. At first Nabiki thought Michiru might be jealous, but after some consideration she dismissed that thought. Nabiki knew that Michiru had a steady girlfriend, one that she seemed intensely loyal too, and that despite occasional bouts of anger at Haruka's wandering eyes.<p>A genuine smile crossed Nabiki's face as she considered the times that she and Kasumi had comforted Michiru after one of Haruka's faux pas. Michiru seemed to take great comfort from her friendship with the Tendo girls. Given that, it had struck a rather jarring note to hear Michiru dismiss Ranma so quickly. Still after considering all that was going on in Ranma's life Nabiki had reluctantly agreed with Michiru . . . though even now sometime dreamed about what could have been had that first day gone differently. Could she and Ranma have been more than the friends they had become?<p>"So give it up Kasumi, have you been in contact with Ranma?" Nabiki asked with a knowing smirk. She was stunned at Kasumi's reply.<p>"It was Michiru," Kasumi sobbed. "I lied to all of you yesterday."<p>"WHO? You what?" Nabiki nearly yelled.<p>Thinking of Kasumi lying was nearly as hard as thinking that Mother Theresa was scamming money out of her charity work.<p>Looking around to see if anyone else was present Nabiki motioned Kasumi to continue.<p>The eldest Tendo sniffled, her mind still on Michiru and her injuries. She wouldn't even talk to Nabiki about this but part of Michiru's 'Master Plan' was to reveal some of the information about her martial skills to Nabiki. They were bound to come out anyway, especially if they did go to university with Michiru as Michiru hoped. Kasumi knew that Michiru still hadn't decided if she was going to tell Nabiki she was Ranma, but some things at least Michiru had admitted she'd have to tell the "mercenary of Nerima".<p>Despite the gravity of the situation and the injuries that Michiru had sustained earlier Kasumi had to fight off a giggle. The very thought of "Ranma" having a "Master Plan" like this would have been laughable, had she not come to learn more about the martial artist after his "escape" from Nerima her life as Michiru. The crafty Michiru yes that she could believe, the clueless Ranma . . . never.<p>Michiru knew that eventually Saotome Genma and Tendo Soun would find out from Happosai (or someone else) about her status as a Master of Anything Goes. Knowing that pair Michiru fully expected them to go ballistic when they found out about there was another Master of what they considered to be their Art. Never mind that they already knew Happosai had trained two other girls in Anything Goes, Happosai's other students weren't masters yet AND they were girls. So to Genma and Soun they didn't count. They would also ignore the fact that Happosai had the right to train whoever he willed. Quite frankly Michiru didn't want to have to put up with their antics any more . . . or even see them again other than in the most limited ways, hence her plan to use Nabiki to "limit" the damage.<p>Though her thoughts were a bit muddled due to the emotional day she had been through, Kasumi knew she had to stick to the script/story they had agreed upon.<p>"Michiru has been studying Anything Goes under Grandfather Happosai . . . "<p>"She WHAT?" Nabiki interrupted, her vaunted mask completely shattered by the unexpected news.<p>"She's been studying under Grandfather and yesterday she challenged him for the right to practice the Art as a Master."<p>"You have got to be kidding me." Nabiki couldn't have shown any more surprise or amazement if she had tried. "You know Akane's going to explode when she finds out."<p>Kasumi only nodded. She loved her youngest sister, but this definitely wasn't going to help Akane's situation right now. Her little sister was going through some tough times. Akane still didn't know what to think about Ranma's disappearance. Akane cycled through anger, loss, hurt and sadness on a daily basis. Both Kasumi and Nabiki knew that Akane loved the pig-tailed boy, and they knew that Ranma loved Akane. The problem was that neither could make themselves admit it. True most of the blame for that could be laid squarely at the feet of Genma and their father, but the bottom line was that things hadn't been working out. Akane was possessive and quick to blame Ranma, while he had been quick to attack her verbally when she insulted him. It all came down to trust, and while Akane loved Ranma . . . she didn't trust him when he was around other girls. Indeed that very thing had led to Ranma's disappearance.<p>Shaking her head, Nabiki pulled her thoughts from Akane and Ranma to the new problem at hand. She had known that Michiru studied some martial arts, but never suspected anything like this. She just never seemed the type. Hell she never even mentioned her interest in Anything Goes or Happosai. She spoke not a word about either, even when Nabiki had complained about the old letch and the problems he caused the Tendos. Nabiki's mind raced as she struggled to figure out just why that omission had occurred. Bottom line, she didn't know, but if there was one thing Nabiki both loved and hated it was a secret she didn't know. Much like Ranma she loved a challenge and like Ranma, and she also hated to lose.<p>"How badly did Michiru lose?" Nabiki questioned hesitantly.<p>"She didn't," Kasumi replied, "but she was hurt rather badly."<p>"SHE WON?" Nabiki exclaimed, once again caught off guard. "How? Is she going to be okay?"<p>"She should be fine, and yes she did win. Grandfather will have to give her Masters status now."<p>"WOW," Nabiki still found it hard to believe that the quiet and gentle Michiru was capable of taking on and defeating the Grandmaster Anything Goes. Heck even Ranma had never really defeated Happosai, only driven him away for short periods of time.<p>"Yes I know. Grandfather was quite shocked, or at least he will be when he wakes up," this time Kasumi couldn't quite stifle the giggles that were welling up from somewhere deep inside her.<p>"So why did she suddenly decide to tell me now?"<p>"She said that she was probably going to need your help in dealing with Father and Uncle Genma."<p>Nabiki nodded. "What does she want me to do?"<p>"Nothing yet. She just wanted you to know in case she needed help convincing them that she had the right to practice Anything Goes. We've both been invited to her house for a visit in a couple of weeks."<p>With a rather wicked (at least for her) grin Kasumi continued. "And Michiru said she has a surprise for you."<p>Nabiki grinned, it had been a while since they'd spent time together, and if there was one thing she was sure of, it was always fun to hang around with Michiru and Kasumi. Still it was kinda strange. The three of them went out together fairly often. I was unusual for more than a couple of weeks to pass between meetings, but until now they had never been to Michiru's home and she had never visited theirs . . . and now that she thought about it, Michiru had never introduced them to her family either. She talked about them all the time, but somehow their paths had never crossed.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Washu was typing on her holographic keyboard, reviewing the data that continued to pour in concerning her "patients" in the laboratory. The data was incredible. It seemed that there was even more to her guests than met the eye. Michiru was surrounded by not just one but three separate fields of magic, the young girl with the purple eyes had one as well, bandana boy had two of his own. The only one lacking a magic field surrounding him was the one Michiru had called Happosai, but even he had some really interesting readings. Before she could pursue the data any further Washu's eyes widened as she saw one of the fields she was monitoring spike, the readings were nearly off the scale and a few moments later a small explosion registered in her lab.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Hotaru opened her eyes, quickly noticing that everything had a strange greenish hue to it. She was still groggy and a bit out of it. The last thing she remembered was some boy attacking her mama. She had tried to stop him, but he kept attacking anyway seemingly ignoring her cries to stop. The last thing she remembered was getting hit  . . . and a whole lot of pain.<p>Hotaru looked around only to find that she was imprisoned in some kind of tube. She could feel her body being suspended and caressed by a warm green liquid that she was apparently immersed in. Crossing her eyes slightly she saw that an oxygen mask covered her nose and mouth allowing her to breath. It took a few moments for it to register that she was naked and floating inside the tube. Gathering her wits about her the purple eyed girl looked at her surroundings outside the tube. She was evidently in a laboratory of some kind. There were other glass enclosures just like hers close by. She could see Michiru-mama floating in the one closest to her, apparently still unconscious. Further down she could see two other tubes which also appeared to be occupied. At least that was her guess since the displays at the top of each container were flashing, in what appeared to be (but probably weren't) random patterns, just like the ones above her mama's tube.<p>Looking around her glass cell, Hotaru tried to find a way out. Unfortunately the search was fruitless. The insides of the tube were smooth and unbroken. The lid was metal of some kind but with nothing resembling a latch or handle anywhere in sight. She had no way out!<p>Hotaru could feel the waves of panic start to overwhelm her. She didn't know where she was, her mama was imprisoned close by and she knew Michiru had been badly hurt in her fight with her old sensei . . . and wherever she was it DEFINITELY was not in a hospital room. This looked more like something out of Star Wars . . . or the Dark Kingdom. Hotaru didn't know what was going on, but she did know she wanted OUT and out NOW. The lab reminded her to much of her father's old lab and she remembered only to well what went on in that place.<p>Reaching into subspace Hotaru grabbed her henshin rod forth and whispered her transformation phrase. There wasn't enough room to swing her weapon, and she didn't think it would be a good idea to sue a Silence Glaive Surprise since she was still inside the tube. Instead she thrust the weapon up and used it like an old fashioned can opener, peeling the top open. The lid dropped to the floor in a shower of multi-colored sparks. Seconds later she was free, standing in the smoking ruins of her former prison, green liquid pooling about her feet, along with shards of crystal from the tube itself. Hotaru had a plan, she was going to get her mama and get out of here before her captors came back.<p>Moving to her mama's prison, Saturn made three precise cuts, the Glaive slicing though the hi-tech material as if it wasn't even there, liquid pouring from each of the cuts. Less than a minute later she held her still unconscious mama in her arms. Naked and as slippery as an eel from the green liquid it was all Hotaru could do to keep from dropping her. With strength that she didn't possess untransformed Saturn pulled Michiru from the tube and laid her gently down.<p>Surprisingly enough a quick check showed that Michiru's bones were mostly healed, though her life force was still dangerously weak. That confused her. How long had they been here? Were they prisoners or were they being helped? Now a bit unsure of her actions, Hotaru tried to think. It didn't take long for her to come to one inescapable conclusion . . . she simply didn't have enough information to make a good decision. Hotaru could only hope that her mama did. Maybe Michiru-mama knew what was going on. Still her mama couldn't tell her anything until she was awake. Keeping the Silence Glaive close to hand she reached out and touched Michiru gently, her touch as soft as a butterfly's kiss, and let her healing power flow. It took longer than expected, nearly three agonizing minutes passed before she felt and heard Michiru stir. First her mama's eyes fluttered then opened, confusion clearly evident in her sapphire eyes.<p>"Hotaru?" Michiru asked looking into the worried purple eyes of her daughter. "Where are we?"<p>"I don't know mama. The last thing I remember is some guy hitting me when I tried to stop him from attacking you."<p>Hotaru flinched at the cold expression that darkened her mama's expressive blue eyes.<p>"I remember that, Ryouga is so dead when I get my hands on him." Michiru's gaze locked onto Hotaru. "Now where are we and how did you get to the meadow?<p>Before any further words could be exchanged they were interrupted by a soft chuckle and a gentle voice.<p>A/N – I don't normally do A/N here but didn't want to influence anyone by putting this at the top. Yes I know there is an info-dump in this story. If you didn't notice or liked getting the info great. If you did and it bothered you sorry. However, I did have a reason for it.<p>The Senshi (despite how some fics portray them) aren't completely clueless when it comes to fighting. True they aren't martial artists, but they are fighters. Not to mention Ami and Setsuna have minds second to none. Therefore I felt it made a lot of sense for them to discuss in detail what was going on and I (personally) think it will help the over-all story-line.<p>Anyway hope you all enjoyed this chapter. Work on Ch. 11 will be starting very soon.
