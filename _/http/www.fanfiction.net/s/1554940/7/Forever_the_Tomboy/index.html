</div>See Chapter 1 for disclaimer<p>Finally the Tomboy – Chapter 7 - Searching for Answers<p>The room was unimpressive, simply that of a normal sixteen year old girl. It was well lit with brightly colored walls, feminine accoutrements lying neatly about. Various posters were hanging on the walls. The subjects portrayed in some of the posters were a bit out of the ordinary however. Mingled with the usual offerings of the latest idols, were ones of Einstein, Fermi and Sagan. The wide variety of subjects for the posters either showed a girl with wide ranging tastes, or one whose friends were trying to get her to open up a bit more with their choice of gifts.<p>The girl sitting at the small desk didn't look extraordinary either, she was simply a cute young girl dressed in sensible blue cotton pajamas. Her physical appearance was unremarkable, she had short hair was cut in a manner that was currently popular, the color was a little unusual in that it had a bluish tint to it, not common, but not that remarkable either here in Japan. Her hair was styled and neatly kept, pretty, but also easy to maintain. All in all the effect gave the impression of an normal girl, cute as a button, but neither homely nor strikingly pretty . . . in other words average.<p>However, the girl sitting ever so still at her desk, lived a life that was far from being that of a "typical" teenager, even allowing for the strangeness of the Juban and Nerima Wards. Mizuno Ami had long been set apart from other kids by the sheer depth and breadth of her intelligence. She was perhaps the smartest high school student in Japan and one of the brightest lights in the intellectual world as a whole. This would be enough to made her stand out in a crowd, and if she had perhaps just a bit less luck in her life, it likely would have resulted in her being a social outcast. Fortunately for her, Ami was not alone. She had friends who were there for her no matter what happened in her life, friends who had proven their loyalty in ways that only combat veterans could really understand.<p>In return for their friendship and loyalty Mizuno Ami placed the awesome weapon that was her mind at their disposal. No one and nothing would be allowed to harm those that she considered her friends if she could prevent it. As a result of this bond Ami used her mind to solve their shared problems. She wielded her intellect like a razor-edged sword and in her hands it was a weapon far more deadly to her foes than a physical blade. More than one of their enemies had found this out to their great displeasure and sorrow.<p>Ami's face was a mask of intense concentration, an expression her friends and acquaintances knew intimately. Mizuno Ami was deep into one of her favorite past-times, and unlike most other girls her age this passion wasn't boys, music or manga. No, what drew her focus this night was something a bit more . . . unusual to say the least. The sometimes "normal" teenager and sometimes Senshi was in the midst of a quest, a crusade to solve a mystery that had been presented to her on a silver platter this very evening, and if there was one thing that the girl both loved and hated . . . it was a mystery. The raven-tressed girl felt an almost instinctual need to solve problems, a need that at times bordered on obsession. Right now she had quite the knotty problem to work on. Actually a pair of problems, one concerned Sailor Neptune, the other the new enemy they had faced earlier.<p>One of her friends and war companions, Sailor Neptune, was acting strangely. While their relationship was not as close as say her relationship to Tsukino Usagi, Ami did count the elegant woman as a friend, and friends were something she cherished. True, Michiru was a hard woman to get to know, and at first things had been . . . well rocky would be phrasing it nicely between the Inner and Outer Senshi. The Inner Senshi and Outer Senshi had approached the problem of Pharaoh 90 in markedly different ways. Usagi/Serenity had hammered away at both sides and trust had slowly grown between them, a trust that was accelerated with Hotaru's adoption by Uranus and Neptune.<p>Those who didn't know her well often considered Michiru cold. She kept the world at bay by presenting at all times an icy façade that kept pushed most people away, never letting them to close to her. Ami suspected that Michiru had been hurt very badly in the past, probably when she lost her parents, as a result she had never learned how to open up for fear of getting hurt. The face Michiru presented to the world was carefully crafted, one of calm and elegance, as if the trials of the world could take no hold on her life. Ami knew differently, after all shyness had built its own mask around her. Still her experience with her own loneliness allowed her, from time to time to see behind the mask, not often and not for long . . . but sometimes. Michiru's pain had diminished greatly in the last year, but traces still remained and probably always would.<p>In many ways her own life ran parallel to the often-enigmatic senshi of Neptune. They were both highly intelligent and multi-talented, good at almost everything they did academically. Both shared the drive to excel, and both were expected to excel at everything, often without regard to the circumstances they were in or praise for a job well done.<p>Ami was very familiar with the price that these expectations could exact on a girl. She knew as well that of the two, she had the better situation. True, her family wasn't as wealthy as the Kaiou Clan, nor did she have the same social advantages that being the daughter, (even if adopted) of two highly respected members of that Clan brought. What she did have, and strongly suspected that Michiru desperately wanted, was a family. That was why Michiru fought so hard for Haruka, Hotaru and Setsuna, she wanted a family who loved her who were there for her. Ami had seen, on more than one occasion, the disappointment lurking behind the sapphire eyes of one Kaiou Michiru when her parents didn't show for one of her concerts or birthdays. Ami knew what it was like to be alone during a celebration and no gift however expensive, could replace the presence of family during these times.<p>Her own mother was often busy and Ami spent a lot of time alone or with friends, but never had her mother been to busy to make time for her on her birthday, never did Ami feel that she was nothing more than a trophy to be displayed and bragged about. Of course her mother did brag, and it was often embarrassing, but her mother also showed her more than a little love to go with the pride in her achievements.<p>On the other hand Ami had seen Michiru alone far more often, her parents seldom bothered to attend the concerts or award ceremonies that Michiru was involved in . . . that is unless they were there show her off to business associates. Yes, Ami's mother was a doctor and emergencies were a part of her mother's life. But Dr. Mizuno tried, and was, there for her, no matter how tired she was coming off shift Dr. Mizuno would make the shift from doctor to mother and talk to her or simply be there to listen if that was needed. That was a lot more than could be said for Michiru's parents.<p>Sailor Mercury waited impatiently for the search program she was running to finish. Though no sign of her impatience was evident on her face, it didn't change the fact that she felt it, nor that she really wanted to know what the heck was going on and wanted to know NOW, but patience was a virtue that Ami possessed in abundance.<p>Sailor Neptune had, for the first time, revealed an impressive ability in the martial arts. Mercury knew that Michiru had some training in the art of combat. Michiru had admitted in the past to "knowing a bit of kendo," but what she had so effortlessly demonstrated tonight was more than "some" training. Even to her untrained eye the skill shown was more than a little impressive, it was at a level that few could match even after years of training, Jupiter's bulging eyes had made that clear. Michiru had shown that she was a Master at the art of the blade, yet before tonight that ability had been as well hidden as a needle in a haystack.<p>One of the questions plaguing the young senshi was WHY it had been hidden . . . and underneath this surface concern was a secondary question. What else might be hidden behind the impassive mask that Michiru showed the world?<p>Ami considered the possibilities, but at present no good options presented themselves to her, so she decided to review the information that she did have while the Mercury computer did its work.<p>Fact: Michiru/Neptune normally did not seek close combat when<br/>dealing with an enemy. She, like all except Jupiter, Venus and Uranus<br/>normally contented herself with ranged attacks based on the planet<br/>from which they drew their power. Fact: Tonight Neptune had used Uranus's Space Sword<br/>Fact: Tonight Neptune had literally cut the creature they were<br/>facing into ribbons and had done so without taking any serious hits in<br/>return.<br/>Fact: Uranus/Haruka had not looked surprised at the skill used, though<br/>she had been "out of it" for some reason.<p>Hypothesis: Uranus had just recently found out about Neptune's skills<br/>and while she intellectually accepted them, she had not had time to<br/>fully accept them.<p>Fact: Uranus had called Neptune Azami.<br/>Fact: Jupiter/Makoto had recognized the name Azami.<br/>Fact: When questioned about Azami, Makoto had responded by telling the<br/>other senshi that Azami was the All-Japan Sword Champion.<br/>Fact: Pluto/Setsuna had NOT been surprised and had even commented that<br/>"Michiru was more herself than she's been in a while".<br/>Fact: Although she tried to hide it Chibi-Usa had not been as<br/>surprised by the events as she should have been.<br/>Fact: Saturn/Hotaru had been shocked at the showing made by her mama<br/>and did not appear to have known about any such skills prior to<br/>tonight.<p>Initial Hypothesis: Michiru was Azami. Setsuna and Chibi-Usa knew<br/>about this as did Haruka, but Haruka had just found this out recently.<p>Secondary Hypothesis: Michiru had recovered more of her Silver<br/>Millennium memories some time back but, for some reason or the other,<br/>had hidden this from the "Outers" including Hotaru.<p>Ami nodded, confirming to herself that these were indeed the "facts"<br/>as she knew them.<br/>The Mercury computer chimed softly, interrupting her reverie as it<br/>announced that<br/>the search and comparison program she had been running was complete.<br/>Before she<br/>could even touch the keyboard Ami was interrupted by another soft<br/>beeping, this<br/>time from the communicator on her wrist. The normally placid senshi<br/>of Mercury<br/>quickly tapped the device disguised as jewelry and with a touch of<br/>impatience spoke.<p>"Usagi, I said . . ."<p>"Uhmm, Ami," a familiar voice interrupted. It was a familiar voice, but it was not the voice of her princess. "Its Makoto."<p>"Sorry Makoto. It's just that Usagi has called me ten times already and I told her the last five that I'd let her know what I found out as soon as I found it out."<p>"Oh. Sorry then, I'll call you later," Makoto answered with a tinge of embarrassment in her tone.<p>"No that's okay. What do you want?" Ami asked politely, though she was sure that Makoto wanted to know the same thing that Usagi, Rei and Minako had wanted to know when they called. In fact the only ones who hadn't already called her at least once were Setsuna (no surprise there) Hotaru, Haruka and Chibi-Usa. Haruka was probably still with Michiru and likely knew more than she was telling already. Ami suspected from the look that Hotaru had given both Pluto and Chibi-Moon that they were taking part in Saturn's own little inquisition.<p>"I was just checking to see what you'd found out," Makoto admitted sheepishly.<p>"Nothing yet, but the Mercury Computer just finished running the data search I had requested when you called," with a lighter tone Mercury continued. "You did manage to hold out longer than all the rest before calling."<p>"Have you looked at it yet?"<p>"No, I was just about to when you called. It's a good thing that I always have the computer on and scanning when we fight or I wouldn't have much to go on."<p>"That's true," Jupiter confirmed, "I'll let you go, give us a call when you find out anything. Oh, Rei said she was going to try a fire reading on both Neptune and the monsters we fought earlier."<p>"I know and I will Makoto," Ami promised.<p>Mercury half considered shutting the communicator off until she was finished, but she was to experienced to do so. While it would be unusual for another attack to come so quickly on the heels of the first, it was not impossible that it would do so and she didn't want to be out of the loop. She didn't want any of her friends to get hurt because she wasn't there to help during an attack.<p>"Talk to you later then."<p>"Yes later." Ami sighed as she ended the conversation.<p>She then turned back to the computer sitting so innocently and patiently on her desk. Despite it's appearance as just another laptop, the Mercury Computer was anything but a "simple laptop". It had processing and data gathering abilities that NASA would envy. No other computer on earth that she knew of could match its capabilities, and right now it beckoned her like a shot of whisky would call to a drunkard . . . and she reached for it with as much eagerness as the drunk would for a shot of his favorite poison.<p>"List data on Azami," Ami typed the commands in furiously, but with great precision, then scrolled the page as the data displayed.<p>Azami, no family or clan affiliation listed. Champion All Japan Kenjutsu Tournaments last three years. This was followed by a rather lengthy list of tournaments of lesser importance won over the last several years. The data finished by listing a series of television clips and articles, mostly in various sports journals, magazine or shows that were about or at least referenced her name. It also contained a few pictures of the swordswoman and some video footage of Azami in action. No other data, such as school records, medical records or family history was available, which was strange given the capabilities of the Mercury Computer, but might indicate that Azami was indeed Kaiou Michiru.<p>Ami shrugged, then called up the video footage, the lack of personal data was just another factor to be considered in the mystery presented. She watched the most recent images taken from the finals of this years Tournament. They were also the newest images as the tournament had been just three weeks ago. Azami, whoever she was, was as skilled as Jupiter indicated. The match showcased her skill as she was apparently in control during the entire match. That wasn't to say the other fighter, (also a woman) wasn't skilled, but the economy of motion and near perfect defense of the smaller Azami was again evident even to one not trained in the way of the sword.<p>"Compare the sword-style used in this match with that used by Sailor Neptune recorded today's date," Ami requested.<p>The computer screen split into two parts the image of Neptune fought a demon on the left and Azami fought her match on the right. The images literally blurred during the fight sequences as they were played in "real time", both images moved at speeds scarcely recognizable as human, though Neptune was moving faster than Azami. That was to be expected though, as the power-up a senshi received when in uniform gave a proportional increase to the natural abilities that the recipient already had. If Azami was Neptune then of course Neptune would be faster.<p>"Display correlation, if any, between the styles used," this request for data was answered almost as the last key was stroked by Ami's fast moving fingers. Mercury was so used to the uncanny speed of the Mercury Computer that she didn't even notice the near instantaneous response to her request.<p>Ami's eyes widened fractionally as one of her hypothesis was confirmed. The words on the screen were clear. Correlation of styles ninety-seven percent. While not a complete match, given how short both fights were the answer was clear.<p>Ever methodical in her quest for knowledge, the fragile seeming girl continued her search. This time she called up the photos from the various magazine articles placing each in a separate panel on the display. Her eyes narrowed further as she scrutinized each one. Although they varied as to hair and eye color Mercury knew that both were relatively easy to conceal. If Azami was indeed Michiru she could have taken such simple precautions as a wig and colored contacts to conceal her identity. As Neptune she had the ability to use the disguise power of her henshin rod if she were so inclined. After comparing the photos for a few moments Ami decided that perhaps both had been done. There were subtle differences between the pictures taken more than two years ago and those taken more recently.<p>Nodding decisively to herself, the senshi of ice and water called up a photo of Michiru and placed it next to one of the older images. The picture was fairly recent as it was a candid shot taken during one of the regular meetings over at Rei's place. In fact the picture was taken about a month ago. The picture was of the kind to draw instant "awwwsss" when looked at. Hotaru was sitting half asleep in Michiru's lap while the older girl leaned against Haruka, all in all a rather cute photo and one that showed the seldom seen softer side of Neptune, as evidenced by the contented smile on her face. Ami paused, took a deep breath and typed in her next series of commands, morphing the hair and eye color of Michiru into the same shades as the picture of Azami next to it. Peering at the altered pictures they appeared to be identical, Ami then superimposed the images . . . to find (as suspected) that they matched perfectly.<p>Ami allowed herself one self-satisfied smirk before reaching once again for her communicator. Before she completed the action she stopped and typed in the parameters of her next search. Ami was going to find out everything the Mercury Computer had on file about the monsters they fought earlier.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>The scene at the Hino Shrine lacked the emphasis on technology that Ami's room and the Mercury computer provided. There were few trappings of the modern world here, other than the electric lights, nothing that detracted from the purpose and sanctity of the shrine, all that was present was the traditional trappings of a Shinto Shrine. Indeed this scene could've been played out with very few changes at any time during the last six hundred years.<p>Kneeling with the ease of long practice was a striking young woman clothed in a shrine maiden's attire. Hino Rei more than looked the part of a shrine maiden, she was the part. Rei possessed the true skills of a Shinto shrine maiden, though they were not yet in full bloom. The raven tressed girl could wield, however imperfectly as yet, powers that had been lost or rejected as superstition to by the modern world. Rei kneeled before the fire pit, her face ruddy in the dancing flames and her long black hair pulled back into a ponytail. Her expression was a paradoxical mix of relaxed concentration. Rei took deep calming breaths as she gazed into the heart of the shrines mystic fire and slipped into a trance that was familiar, yet ever new to experience.<p>Hino Rei was a study of contrasts. Her personality was well fitted to the planet she drew her power from, and was a hot as the flames she looked into so intently. The Senshi of Mars possessed a fire deep within her soul that couldn't be completely tamed, but which could be directed, as she was attempting to do tonight. Sometimes using the power felt like rafting a raging torrent without a paddle, but the knowledge learned had proven to often to be critical to her needs to ignore.<p>She also considered herself a friend to the Outer Senshi and she too was concerned for her friend Michiru. Admittedly Rei had her problems with the Outers from time to time, and she was sometimes uncomfortable in their presence, but they were still her teammates and allies in their hidden struggle against evil. Even more though than just allies, they were her friends, and like the rest of the Inner Senshi Hino Rei did not desert her friends when there was trouble brewing. No, whatever difficulties Mars had with them in the past, and whatever problems they might have in the future, they were her friends first and foremost. She too would do what it took to help them.<p>The fire senshi's problems were two-fold this night. Even as she began to fall into her mystic trance Rei felt a shudder work its way down her spine to settle most uncomfortably in her belly. The monsters they had faced tonight were unlike any that the Scouts had fought before. The Negaverse used a twisted and dark source for their powers true but it was like a twisted reflection of the power used by the senshi themselves. Rei fought back a grin as a random thought flitted its way across her mind, interrupting for a moment her meditation attempts. The Silver Millennium and the Negaverse were much like the Jedi and Sith from that American movie Star Wars. Both were sources of power and those who fought for truth and love had to be very careful lest they too fall, drawn to the easy power offered by the Negaverse. Even the enemies they fought seemed like warped mirror images of the Scouts themselves, several of their foes even calling themselves "Scouts".<p>Tonight though it had been different. The monsters had radiated an aura of palpable evil, overwhelming otherworldly evil that had threatened to swamp her mystic senses. The creatures weren't once human foes that had been seduced by the Dark Side, they WERE the Dark. The power they flaunted spoke only to the darkest and most depraved desires of human nature, and the stench of that evil repelled made her want to retch. They oozed evil, their aura's were so intensely corrupt that it was as if someone had taken all the sins of man and distilled them, casting out as waste all that was not dark and unholy, leaving only the purest essence of evil behind.<p>Rei closed her eyes as she struggled to clear her mind, reaching within herself for the power she knew she possessed. Opening her eyes she stared into the flames as she began to chant and to pray. She had done all that she could to prepare herself. She had taken a purifying bath, placed wards all around the shrine, and had dressed herself in robes that were ceremonially clean, now it was time to begin.<p>"Mystic fires, spirits of my ancestors, Kami of all those that are good hear my plea. I come to you this night pure of purpose, clear of thought, I seek your guidance, I seek your aid. Hear my plea O spirits, Hear my plea Kami, see my need and answer my call. I ask most humbly knowing that my friends and I cannot do this alone. We need your protection, show me that which I must know, show me that which I need."<p>The maiden felt her awareness both expand and contract at the same time. All sounds of the modern world faded from her hearing, all thoughts except those so desperately seeking this knowledge faded as well.<p>Now opening her eyes Rei stared deep into the flames, her heart and mind open, trusting in the protective wards so carefully placed to protect her soul from harm. Her spirit was open, as it had to be to receive her vision, and she was in peril if her wards failed. Despite the danger, and in a way embracing it, she searched for answers, for clues to the future and the dangers that were now upon them.<p>Without warning Rei felt a warm presence, one that comforted her, yet one whose power dwarfed her own as surely as the sun dwarfed the moon. There in the fire was stood the image of a young gajin woman, a girl really, who looked even younger than her own years. Yet whose mere presence spoke of age and knowledge, whose eyes whispered of seeing things that were yet to come. Eyes that still managed to show compassion for the shrine maiden. She had long black hair, and bore strange blue markings on her face that looked as if they were tattoos. She was dressed in unfamiliar robes, all in all she should have struck a jarring note, but did not. A hammer was strapped to her back ready for instant use. Despite the kami's strange appearance all Rei felt was the rightness of the vision.<p>When the kami spoke it was in a young sounding voice, yet one that was full of confidence ,as if she knew that all would be well in the future.<p>"Take heart Sailor Mars. The enemy behind the enemy you face cannot be defeated until the final battle, until Ragnarok itself, until the battle of Armageddon it will exist. Your fears are well founded for you fought the forces of Hell itself tonight. Hell can be fought and pushed back, its willing minions defeated and cast down. That is the fight that you must face. If you are willing and strong you will find that even the forces of Hell cannot stand against you. Many lives can be saved from the darkness if you refuse to surrender. Your prayers have not gone unheeded, your need has not been ignored, Kami-sama himself has heard your request this night. The answers you seek will be revealed in time, for now look deep into the flames and learn,"<p>The young kami then looked sternly out from the flames, "Beware arrogance and pride, you will find allies if you allow yourselves to trust, but place that trust carefully. There is a fine line between wisdom and foolishness.  Trust your friends even when all is not as it seems and has not been as you have believed. Trust in the Princess, she sees the heart and sees true more often than not."<p>The stern gaze dropped, the warning having been given. Then with a warm, yet somehow still mischievous, smile the messenger faded leaving the flames empty for the space of two heartbeats. Then images returned flowing and dancing in the flames with a clarity that surpassed all of her previous scryings.<p>The first image unsurprisingly was Michiru. At Usagi's request, (and to be certain a need of her own) the shrine maiden was to find out what she could regarding the recent revelations by the Outers.<p>Rei watched as Michiru danced in the flames. First she danced through unarmed katas. , Behind her, mirroring her every move, was a young man dressed in red and black silks. The boy's expression was at first desolate and sad, but as the vision continued turned to one of peace. His long black hair was tied into a pigtail, his every move graceful, controlled . . . and identical to those made by Michiru. The pair moved in synch as they danced though kata after kata. As the pair fought unseen enemies, they moved ever closer to one another until finally the kata ended. The boy stood directly behind Michiru, arms wrapped around her from behind and holding her in a warm embrace. The raven-haired youth looked down at the smaller woman, then kissed her softly before he faded into a cloud of blue light, his face serene even as he disappeared. The effervescent cloud then surrounded Michiru and began to disappear as if she were drawing the essence of the light within herself.<p>Despite the fact that she was in a trance Rei watched in shock as the boy placed his lips in a gentle kiss on the top of Michiru's head. Michiru was being hugged and kissed by a BOY, now she KNEW the end of the world was upon them.<p>Looking closer, she saw sadness in Michiru's eyes, a sadness that was soon replaced with determination as she resumed her kata, this time armed with a bokken and dressed in the traditional garments of a samurai. Opposed to her and attacking with fierce skill was an old man with long gray hair and glasses. They fought then Neptune bowed after she was defeated, a rare smile gracing her face replacing the scowl the loss had put there.<p>With the suddenness that often characterized her visions, Michiru transformed into Sailor Neptune in mid-move . . . and the bokken morphed into a katana. Its mate, a matching wazikashi appeared in her other hand.  The blades were works of art, shining examples of a sword-smiths crafting.  They were plain in appearance, lacking ornamentation of any kind other than the sheer perfection of their make. The hilts of both blades were wood, and the scabbards the same, but the color of the wood was most unusual being a rich warm red. The scabbards were unadorned as well, except for a simple red cord on each. No other ornamentation was needed though as the simple lines and rich wood provided a beauty that was almost otherworldly.<p>Rei started again as she looked deeper into the flames, using senses not available to her outside of this trance the senshi of Mars discovered that the swords and scabbards both glowed with a comforting blue aura.<p>The change had no more than occurred when Rei's perception changed again. Rei saw a building, forty maybe fifty stories high and of typical glass and steel construction. She didn't have time to look for any identifying marks when she was pulled inside. Everywhere she looked she saw the trappings of wealth and power. Thick carpeting covered the floors, expensive paintings dotted the walls, statues, urns and vases were tastefully placed here and there. The furniture itself screamed of the large sums needed to buy each piece. Pulled along by the flames Rei soon reached the top floor . . . but she could not enter as something barred her way.<p>Reaching out with her extra senses, the shrine maiden instantly knew what was stopping her. The entire floor was warded, but the wards were nothing like those she and her grandfather made. These reeked of evil, there were wards to prevent detection, others to prevent entry and still others to cause harm to those unrightfully seeking entrance. She spotted one of the wards nearby and forced herself to draw closer though each step made the stench of evil grow strong, with each step became ever more disgusted.<p>Her wards were made by taking special inks and carefully drawing the proper characters on them while infusing them with some of her spiritual energy. These . . . abominations shared only two things with her wards, they were written and they were imbued with spiritual energy. There the similarities stopped. Whoever or whatever made these had used blood for ink and what Rei feared was human skin for paper. She was no tanner, nor an expert on leather, but there were old tales still recorded in the Shrines records that spoke of necromancers and sorcerers who utilized these forbidden and darkest of arts.<p>Before she could bring herself to look closer her view changed again. This time she saw the Scouts in action fighting a desperate battle against foes whose very aura warped the area around them, whose presence felt twisted and whose grasp left dark greasy stains on the souls of those they touched.  She watched battle after battle as the Scouts fought and won. Rei quickly noticed that as time passed the Scouts grew ever more skillful with both their magic and their fighting abilities. Mars watched as fight after fight the Scouts turned back the darkness, only to be called forth again to fight. She watched as their enemies grew ever more terrible in their abilities . . . and in the darkness they carried with them, yet the Scouts fought on.<p>Again her perspective changed. This time the vision revealed a desolate landscape. A feeling of foreboding swept over the fiery Mars, this place was just wrong. The area was devastated, ruined buildings and rubble dotted the area, empty destroyed reminders of what man had achieved and then lost. An aura of despair and hopelessness clung to everything she could see. Here and there she spotted movement, furtive and careful. A closer looked revealed desperate men, women and children striving to survive in the devastation. A second look at the desolate scene revealed this to be Tokyo itself. In the distance she could see a dark forbidding fortress looming over the ruined city.<p>Rei hoped to get closer, but even as this thought came to her she sensed that she was no longer alone. Spinning on her heel to look behind her the normally fearless Sailor Mars felt her heart leap into her throat. A demon was near, and with it a hideous creature that looked like a dog straight out of a nightmare. The demon was reptilian, much like the one Neptune fought earlier, and it was apparently looking for someone. She watched as it carefully scanned the surroundings and as the hellhound snuffled the ground seeking a scent. She watched as it moved closer, confident that it couldn't see her, as she was not really present. That is she was confident until it looked straight at her with its hellish eyes, an evil grin spreading across its face.<p>"I thought you were all dead," the malevolence in its voice was matched only by its satisfaction as it continued. "It has been to long since I've heard a shrine maiden screaming as I used her. It's been to long since I've broken one for my use, I will look forward to your torment," The creature laughed as it shook out a long whip and prepared to strike.<p>Shocked that the creature could see her she hesitated, and that hesitation nearly cost her life. Fortunately, even as the whip streamed towards her she once again felt a tug on her spirit as she was yanked away from the confrontation.<p>Rei awoke to the echo of her scream, blood full of adrenaline and her heart in her mouth. Sailor Mars was no coward, but the demons words had shaken her. Knee's popped as she rose to her feet and shakily stretched.<p>She had found little to settle her questions about Neptune, and much to worry about as to the rest of her vision. She might not know exactly what was going on with the demons, but the portents were for great trouble and strife to come. Mars certainly didn't like that answers, and she knew that her friends wouldn't either.<p>Rei knew that what she saw could happen, the fire never lied when it gave its warnings. More importantly she also knew that it warned of future danger and that steps could be taken to prevent the tragedy shown, to prevent that possible future. Gathering her determination around her like a cloak Rei strove to banish her fears. Instead of focusing on the dangers she clung to the words given to her by the kami. They could fight and they could prevail . . . the darkness could be held back. Rei also held on to the knowledge that Crystal Tokyo did exist and if they fought long and hard enough what she had seen tonight would never come to pass. Tonight, well tonight she had to sleep, they would talk at the senshi meeting tomorrow, but first Rei stepped outside, she wanted to make sure that ALL the wards were still in place.<p>* * * * * * * * * *<p>"She's asleep Pu-chan," Chibi-Usa informed her companion as she joined her in the kitchen.<p>"Good," Setsuna replied as she poured each of them a cup of tea. "She needs it, healing all of those people certainly took a lot out of her."<p>"Yeah," Chibi-Usa took a sip of the offered beverage before continuing. "I didn't think she was going to let either of us off the hook."<p>"Agreed, and until I get a chance to talk to myself I didn't want to risk saying to much."<p>Chibi-Moon laughed softly. "Do you realize just how silly that sounded?"<p>The green haired woman quirked one eyebrow and allowed a small smile to creep its way onto her face.<p>"Yes, as a matter of fact I do, unfortunately it's the truth. I have to admit though that our language just isn't really suited to discuss time travel yet without sounding a bit silly."<p>Usa giggled again before turning serious. "What do you think is going on?"<p>"Do you want an honest answer to that Small Lady?"<p>Setsuna continued after seeing Chibi-Usa's wordless affirmation.<p>"To be honest I don't know. I've apparently been hiding some things from even myself . . . and I always find that troubling."<p>"Yeah that's got to be a pain. At least with me I know that you've got a reason for it when you tell me not to talk about certain things.<p>Usa smirked as she considered several things about the future that Pluto didn't know yet. Setsuna was going to be in for a shock when she found out about what Haruka and Michiru had been discussing earlier. Chibi-Usa could hardly wait to see the look on Pu's face when she found out that Uranus and Neptune wanted to have a baby. Even that news wasn't the best part. Usa knew that if things went as they should, Michiru and Haruka were going to have a child. Unless she failed her mission and the time-line was altered they were going to have a boy, Kaiou Yoshito.<p>His birth was going to cause quite a ruckus with Michiru's adoptive parents. Until Michiru's pregnancy they had not raised much of a fuss about their daughter's lover. They had still hoped that Michiru was "going through a phase" and would soon seek the company of boys like a "normal" girl would. Once they found out that wasn't going to happen, they were going to threaten her with removal from the Kaiou Registry . . . to bad for them that another option was going to be available soon for Michiru. The Kaiou Clan might no longer want Michiru, but there was one that did, one that would accept her as she was. No, what was giving her the giggles now was that she knew something else that Pluto didn't know, and wasn't going to find out about . . . until it was much to late.<p>True, Michiru and Haruka were going to have to wait a year or so before they would be able to actually have the baby. It would be that long until it was safe for Michiru to be pregnant. Until then they (and all the other Scouts) were going to be to busy fighting this latest menace to have Michiru "out of action" for several months. Actually having the child would have to wait until the others could take up some of the burden. Given that incentive, Michiru would work hard to teach the other senshi her fighting skills.<p>The Scouts were going to be in for a major shock once Michiru began training them, she was a hard taskmaster and made USMC Drill Instructors look like traditional Japanese housewives in comparison. Eventually they were all going to become the warriors they had always been destined to be . . . even Usagi and Ami. Still, that wasn't what had the pink haired girl stifling her laughter. No, what had her fighting so hard to keep a straight face was the fact that Sailor Pluto, the "Ice Maiden" of the senshi was going to find herself falling head over heels in love with little Yoshito, and wasn't going to have a clue on how to handle it.<p>Yes, the "Ice Maiden of Pluto" was going to have a meltdown, and boy were Mokoto and Minako ever going to enjoy that. Heck they still teased Setsuna about it, even in the 30th century they enjoyed telling stories about Pluto's "misadventures in love". Talk about payback, those two boy hungry girls got it in spades. Of course when they both fell for his younger brother things got really interesting for a while, and Pluto realllly enjoyed getting some payback of her own. It was amazing how little a thirty year difference in ages meant when you lived hundreds of years.<p>Setsuna watched her friend carefully and bit back her frustration as Chibi- Usa's face turned several interesting shades of red. Obviously Small Lady knew something, thought it was funny what ever it was, and it was just as obvious that couldn't . . . or wouldn't tell. Sometimes it was really frustrating to be the Senshi of Time. Both of them, Chibi-Usa AND her future self were keeping secrets from her. Setsuna sighed again, whatever it was would come out in time, and eventually it would be her "dishing it out" instead of taking it, which in Plutos' mind was a much better option . . . even if she was giving it to herself.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Tendo Kasumi, by most considered the person least likely to affected by the chaos in Nerima, placed the last of the supper dishes on the table. Her family, or what was left of it at least, was gathered round ready to eat.<p>She didn't have to say anything before Saotome Genma dug into the food, with the rest following quickly after. Kasumi knew that it was either dig in quick or risk not having anything left to eat.<p>"Just how long is father going to let him stay?" Kasumi wondered.<p>It had been just over three months since Ranma's disappearance, yet her father had not once talked about the future, other than wondering when Ranma would return and crying about the schools not being joined. Tendo Soun ignored the letter Ranma left saying that he was never coming back and that he was releasing Akane from the engagement that she never wanted. Ranma had gone on to say that he knew that neither Kasumi nor Nabiki were interested in him as a prospective husband, and that he certainly wasn't going to put the burden of the engagement on their unwilling shoulders.<p>"Oh Ranma, if you had only known, Nabiki wouldn't have fought the engagement at all. She had finally begun to realize just how much you meant to her. Of course she never had an opportunity or much of a chance to tell you. Everyone (except Ukyo and Shampoo), thought you and Akane were going to marry. Despite what most of Nerima thought there was much more to Nabiki than the mercenary image she projected. Family was sacred to her. Yes she sold pictures of Akane, but that was to keep a roof over their head, and none of the pictures were more than risqué. Admittedly Nabiki had rationalized the sales to Kuno as harmless, telling herself that since the kendoist was already fixated on Akane they weren't really hurting anyone. Shaking her head Kasumi pulled her mind from the past and wondered about the future.<p>Kasumi frowned internally, though the expression never reached her placid face, just what were the next few days going to bring? It felt weird not knowing, at least in general terms, what was going to happen next. She had grown accustomed to having "inside information" and had always drawn comfort from knowing that things were going to eventually work out for Ranma.<p>The last two years had been a combination of wonder and torment. Strange, and often to weird to believe, events had surrounded her household. She had weathered them all with a shrug and occasional "Oh my." She had been able to do so because of two things. The first was her own nature. Kasumi was one of those rare individuals whose peaceful aura could affect all but the most strong-willed of individuals. She believed in and looked for the best in people, and surprisingly enough nearly everyone responded positively this attitude, she was a legend in the Nerima Ward.<p>Kasumi smiled as she recalled one occasion (of many) exemplifying this. She had been going past a construction site where a new building was going up and some a "newby" on the crew had tried to hassle her with a wolf whistle and some rather forward comments on her looks. The poor guy hadn't even finished his comments before the others took the opportunity to "set him straight" and make him apologize for his rude behavior. She found the attention somewhat flattering, if improper, and had thanked her "rescuers" with a demure smile.<p>With Ranma gone change was in the wind. At Michiru's insistence Kasumi had made plans to attend college this next term. The only one who knew was Nabiki, and even her middle sister didn't know where the money came from. All Nabiki "knew" was that Kasumi had received a privately funded scholarship. Kasumi's smile grew as she considered all that Michiru had done for her and her family. Her long-time friend was quite well off, she knew that, but what she hadn't expected was the college fund that had been set-aside for her almost twelve years ago. It had come as quite the surprise to find out that Michiru/Ranma had set the bank account up (somehow) when she went back in time to establish her new life. Kasumi didn't know where the money came from, but knowing Ranma it was not from stealing. The oldest Tendo suspected that Ranma had participated in some (less than legal) street fights to obtain the money. However, he had gotten it, the money was hers now as Michiru had refused to even consider taking it back<p>Ranma had also set up similar funds for both Nabiki and Akane. The last was somewhat surprising given the rather unpleasant way they parted, but Kasumi knew that Ranma had a good heart and despite the anger she had shown yesterday, Kasumi knew that she still cared for her little sister, though no longer as a possible wife.<p>It could be that Michiru simply didn't feel it fair to help Kasumi and Nabiki without providing at least something for Akane. Kasumi didn't know, and to be quite honest at this point it didn't really matter. Michiru was, and had been for two years, head over heels in love with her girlfriend Ten'ou Haruka.<p>Kasumi continued her musings as she ate, even though distracted the oldest Tendo sister was graceful with every move.<p>Akane, her youngest sister, still couldn't decided how to take Ranma's disappearance. She cycled from happiness to anger to sadness and back again. Akane did care for Ranma, but the problems that they had in their relationship had all to often overwhelmed those feelings. Akane good had reason to dislike boys when Ranma came, courtesy of the morning fights at school, and that distrust had ruined what possibilities they had together.<p>Ranma wasn't blameless either, and the fact that it was indeed mostly his father's fault didn't absolve him of some of the blame. They had gotten off on the wrong foot from the very first. Kasumi didn't think Akane ever completely got over the feeling of betrayal that first afternoon when she found out Ranma was a boy . . . and he hadn't told her.<p>Then the whole multiple fiancée mess came to light. If the others hadn't shown up things probably would've been okay between Ranma and Akane. After all Ranma and Akane had become closer after the whole "skating rink" incident. But such was not to be, first Shampoo, then Ukyo not to mention Kodachi arrived to complicate matters. The other fiancées that popped up from time to time didn't help either. The whole mess just got out of hand.  Akane couldn't trust Ranma, and Ranma himself didn't know how to talk to Akane without insults. Yes, his problems with his "softer" emotions and lack of communication skills was the pandas fault as well, but Ranma didn't figure out how to talk to Akane until it was to late, by then the distrust was to well entrenched to dig up sa long as the other fiancées were around to cause trouble.<p>Kasumi flinched as she recalled Ranma's last attempt to work things out with Akane. It hadn't been pretty. To many prior encounters, to many misunderstandings had created a fog of distrust that neither could see through. Ranma made one last try to talk to her youngest sister, and perhaps if he had waited for her to calm down, perhaps if Kodachi hadn't come by that evening things would've been different, but things had gone wrong and now they had to live in the present, instead of in the "what might have been."<p>Nabiki on the other hand, didn't realize what Ranma truly was until it was too late. She had fixated on his "jock" personality, uncharacteristically forgetting that he'd no sensei, no example other than the Panda during most of his life. Of course given those circumstances Ranma had been rough around the edges. What was astounding was that beneath his uncouth manner Ranma was the kind of guy that most girls could only dream about. He was loyal, courageous, caring and highly intelligent. Unfortunately he didn't know how to present himself, knowing only the road and Genma, his social growth had been stunted considerably. Despite his shortcomings though Ranma had always been there for her family, had never betrayed his honor with one of the other fiancées despite many opportunities to do so (and girls ever so willing to be "taken advantage of") he had instead consistently placed everyone else's safety and needs before his own.<p>Nabiki had finally figured that out, had finally seen the jewel he would someday become, but by then Ranma had already decided to leave, and leave in such a way that she wouldn't be found. It still broke Kasumi's heart to hear Nabiki finally confess that she might like Ranma as more than a "little brother", and Nabiki knowing that she was part of the reason he left. Kasumi, on the other hand, nearly broke down as she and Nabiki talked, because she knew that Ranma was gone for good. He was permanently (or so she still said) a girl and had been for years as her friend Michiru.  Nabiki's revelation and her subsequent resolution to show Ranma she had changed (when he came back), was to little to late. Still, some good had come of it as Nabiki began to see the money she depended upon to keep her safe might do that . . . but it wouldn't keep her happy.<p>Father and the panda hadn't changed at all. They still thought Ranma would come crawling back and that the "schools would be joined" if not with Akane then with either Nabiki or herself. That wasn't going to happen either. Part of Kasumi regretting losing Ranma as a little brother, but the rest of her rejoiced in her friendship with Michiru. They intended to go to college together and had made plans to do so. Michiru only had one more year of High School to go, and it would take Kasumi that long to do everything that she needed to do to gain her own admittance to a university. Michiru/Ranma had always been there for her, and for that she was eternally grateful.<p>"Father, I will be taking a short trip tomorrow so I have fixed a cold lunch for you. I should be back in time to fix supper." Kasumi stated calmly, placing her chopsticks on the table.<p>"Where are you going Kasumi?" Nabiki asked slyly. "Visiting a boyfriend?"<p>"Oh no, I'm going to visit a shrine tomorrow with Aunty Nodoka. It's way out in the country and it's supposed to be very beautiful there. An old friend of mine is going to meet me and show me around. She says it's really lovely this time of year."<p>"Do you want me to go with you daughter?" Soun queried.<p>"No father, Grandfather Happosai said he was going that direction and will ride with Aunty and me. I'll take the train back with Aunty Nodoka and my friend."<p>"The Master?" Genma and Soun looked at each other, "But why?"<p>"Are you questioning me boys?" Happosai yelled at his former students.<p>"No Master, of course not," the two chorused, their voices quavering with fear.<p>"Good then it's settled."<p>Kasumi looked over at the last "family member" around the table. Grandfather Happosai had a date with Ranma tomorrow. Kasumi helped set it up, and was going to watch Ranma fight for the right to practice Anything Goes. She didn't know what agreement had been made between the two, but she did know that it was coming to a head tomorrow. She also knew that she would be there for her friends, even if both were really the same person. Kasumi just hoped that Michiru could echo Ranma's old boast that Saotome Ranma never loses.<p>* ~* * * * * * * * * *<p>The drive home was short, Haruka showcasing her driving skills as she was accustomed to, much to the annoyance of her fellow travelers. With the ease of long practice her customized sports car darted though traffic like a barracuda moving through a school of tuna, lesser vehicles and drivers giving her the right of way.<p>The drive was short and it was also silent. Haruka had most of her attention on the road and other drivers, while the small portion that wasn't so involved was still trying to assimilate the information that had been dumped on her this night. Michiru was just as quiet, obviously lost in thoughts of her own.<p>Haruka felt herself relax as drive began to ease tensions that had been creeping up on her all evening. To many, a drive though Tokyo traffic was anything but soothing, but to a driver of her skills it was nothing, a familiar operation that calmed her by its common nature.<p>She spared a quick glace away from the road outside and to her petite passenger. Michiru was staring out the passenger window with what was an almost unbearably cute pout on her face. Haruka didn't know what was running through her lover's mind, but she did know that they were going to work past it. The blond snorted softly, there was no way in hell that she was going to let anything come between them. She had found her soul mate and by Kami she wasn't letting her go. Uranus and Neptune were lovers in the Silver Millennium and they were lovers now, she knew she'd rather die than give Michiru up, and if the Inners didn't like it they could stick it.<p>Haruka wasn't really worried about the other Senshi. They might moan and complain, about being kept in the dark, but if she didn't let her lovers secrecy bother her they shouldn't either. Haruka rather suspected that the communicators or phone lines were burning up tonight as the Inners gossiped about what they had seen and heard.<p>No, what worried her was the way Michiru was handling things. She had no idea why Michiru was overreacting so much about the whole Azami thing. Sure, she'd been upset to find out her lover was a student of her idol Saotome Nodoka and hadn't told her about it. But who wouldn't be? The senshi of space was much more worried about the reason why Michiru hadn't talked to her before now. Why did Michiru hide her relationship with Nodoka, why did Michiru hid her friendship with this Kasumi woman, she didn't know, but she was going to find out.<p>Wheeling the car deftly into the driveway, Haruka tapped the button raising the garage door then eased into the parking bay.<p>"C'mon, we're home," Haruka tapped Michiru on the shoulder interrupting whatever reverie the other woman was holding with herself. "Let's go inside, after all I've got plans for you."<p>Michiru's smile seemed a little forced, but it was there, definitely an improvement on the worry she had so uncharacteristically displayed before. They nodded and spoke briefly to Setsuna, who was watching television, then padded up the stairs to their room.<p>Michiru was the first to enter, and Haruka took full advantage of that occurrence, mesmerized by the seductive sway of Neptune's bottom. Entering second, the blond tomboy looked away from her lover for a moment as she pushed the door to their room closed. The darn latch was sticking and if she didn't lift just right on the door handle the latch wouldn't catch. While she certainly wasn't ashamed about what she knew was going to take place, that didn't mean that she wanted an audience either. It would be bad enough to have Setsuna walk by and see them, but Hotaru and Chibi-Usa were home and she most certainly did not want them walking in at the wrong time. A moment later she heard a definitive click as the latch went home. Haruka didn't have time to look up before she heard Michiru speak, and not in her normal contralto either.<p>"Haruka, I told you earlier that tonight was your night. Do you have anything special in mind . . . or do you want me to improvise," Michiru purred.<p>The words weren't all that sexy in and of themselves, Haruka noted absently, even as she felt her temperature rising and her heartbeat accelerating. Looking up she saw a vision of perfect blue loveliness. In the few seconds that she had looked away, Michiru had stopped and taken a hellishly seductive pose just an arms length away. Haruka didn't know how someone could look so . . . damn sexy just standing there, but Michiru was more than managing it. She felt her jaw drop open and a small amount of drool forming in her mouth as she stared.<p>"Damn she's good at this," Haruka noted, though it was far from the first time she had this thought. "It's hard to believe she was so shy when we first got together."<p>"I think you like what you see don't you?" the purr was still in Michiru's voice as she turned a slow circle in front of Haruka, keeping her eyes locked to those of her lover as she turned. Michiru stopped about halfway through her turn and looked over she shoulder at Haruka, she reached behind herself and with a slow movement pulled the zipper at the back of her dress open. Finishing her turn Michiru once again faced her lover.<p>Haruka noted absently that the thin straps holding the dress on were the only things holding the dress on. She watched as her blue haired lover took one of those ever so delicate hands and pushed the strap off her left shoulder, then repeated the action with her other hand dropping the right strap so that it hung loosely at her side. Still unmoving, and with her pulse pounding in her ears, Haruka could only watch Michiru slowly shrugged and let the blue silk dress slide down around her ankles where it glistened like a shimmering pool at her feet.<p>The blond woman swallowed as she noted that Michiru hadn't been just teasing earlier this evening. She was wearing a concoction of lace and silk that tantalized Haruka more than if Michiru had just stripped naked. The bra was mostly lace and hid nothing from Haruka's impassioned gaze. Moving her eyes downward, and enjoying every inch of the view, Haruka saw that Michiru hadn't been kidding about what she wasn't wearing, for the only thing encasing her hips was a lacy garter belt, just enough was there to support the blue silk hose that encased her gorgeous legs.<p>"Yes, yes I do very much," Haruka finally found her voice. She found that when she spoke her voice was soft and velvety with lust, desire . . . and more importantly love. "But we need to talk,"<p>"Haruka . . . love," Michiru's voice was also filled with need. "I promise we'll talk tomorrow . . . can't it wait until then? I just want to show you how much I love you, show you what you mean to me. I . . . I love you so very much."<p>Haruka shivered at the raw need showing in Michiru's eyes. This was one of the things about her lover that intrigued her so much. Michiru kept herself under such complete control most of the time, but for her, for her "baka tomboy" as Michiru often called her, the walls came down and the heart usually protected so fiercely was left exposed, defenseless and vulnerable. Haruka knew that this was indeed Michiru's greatest gift to her. She sometimes felt unworthy of such a gift, but it was hers, freely given and hers alone.<p>"We'll talk tomorrow," Haruka conceded. Yes she wanted, no really needed, to find out what was going on. But for tonight there was a greater need, Michiru obviously needed to be shown, . . . in a way most physical, that she was loved.<p>The light that ignited in her lover's eyes was all the reward she needed. If nothing else happened tonight except seeing that expression of love that would be enough, Haruka decided as she saw the flames of passion so clearly expressed in those wondrous blue eyes. Still, she knew that was not all that was going to happen, she opened her arms as the lingerie clad Michiru swayed toward her. She felt her own desire flare up when Michiru unbuttoned the jacket to her tux and slid her arms around her. She could feel the heat from her lover though the silk shirt she still wore and basked in it, but more importantly she felt complete when Michiru stood on her tip toes and pulled her into a scorching, yet somehow still gentle kiss.<p>Once this first kiss was finished, and after rational thought returned to her mind, Haruka vowed once again that she would love Michiru forever. All thoughts ceased other than those of love and passion when Michiru led her over to their bed . . . and that was as it should be. Tomorrow she would worry, but tonight she would love.
