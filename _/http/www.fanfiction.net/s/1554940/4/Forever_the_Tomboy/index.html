</div>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer<p>Forever the Tomboy Ch. 4<p>Forever the Tomboy -Ch 4 - Conversations and Revelations<p>Chibi-Usa fought her panic as Hotaru turned away from the door and toward her. The young princess silently cursed the slip-of-the-tongue that let to this confrontation. Pu warned her EVERY time she returned to the past to be careful and she had blown it in less than two minutes. Chibi-Usa knew things, things that she did not dare reveal about the future, for to let them slip before it was time could endanger the future, and her very own existence.<p>Despite what many thought, the future was not a certainty, instead it was a possibility, if they were lucky a probability of how things would turn out, but carved in stone it was not. It was exactly for this reason that Pluto and the others in Crystal Tokyo didn't talk about specifics regarding their life to her. Events could, and undoubtedly would be affected by the knowledge that she possessed. It would be so easy for someone to take, or sometimes even more importantly, to fail to take actions based upon this foreknowledge.<p>Future princess or not, Chibi-Usa had screwed up and she knew it. While she knew that her Haruka and Michiru were just as much in love in the future as they were now, that could change all to easily. If they took the relationship for granted, or if others took it for granted and didn't help them out when they needed it the relationship could die. Usa shuddered as she considered the possible repercussions of that happening. Sailors Uranus and Neptune were among the strongest and staunchest of the Moon Kingdom's defenders, their teamwork bordered on the uncanny sometimes. If that relationship died would their ability to work together die as well? It was a possibility that frightened her.<p>That meant that she dared not reveal to many secrets even to her best friend. Not even Sailor Pluto could tell what effect any given piece of knowledge would have on the future. A fact that seemed so innocuous to them now could change everything, could destroy the future that was Crystal Tokyo. She was going to have to be verrryyyy careful as to what and how much she could tell Hotaru.<p>"We are going to talk," Hotaru growled, her purple eyes shining with determination. "and you are going to answer some questions."<p>Once again Usa decided to act innocent, sometimes it even worked, though almost never when she tried it with her mother, right now she was hoping for a better result.<p>"What do you want to talk about?" Usa answered, her voice positively dripping with good cheer. Usa grimaced inwardly, her tone was so sweet that if bottled and sold dentists would have their business assured for years.<p>"Don't play dumb with me Princess." Hotaru answered steadily, her tone was flat and brooked no nonsense. "Why did you call Michiru-mama sensei?"<p>Flinching imperceptibly the pink-haired girl searched for an answer that would be both truthful and innocuous.<p>"Well, all of the Senshi have things that they teach me. Neptune is just one of them."<p>Chibi-Usa watched as the Silence Bringer considered the answer.<p>"What exactly does mama teach you?"<p>"Well . . . " Once again Usa considered her words carefully. "Lots of things."<p>"There." Usa thought, "that's both true and vague enough not to cause any problems."<p>"Usa . . . What . . . Kind . . . Of . . . Things." The words were spaced and emphasized once again to let Usa know that Hotaru was NOT going to be put off, not this time. She had gone through to much today, both good and bad to be ignored or treated like a little kid.<p>The silence lingered then stretched on, the quiet somehow sounded louder than thunder, growing in volume even as all remained quiet. Chibi-Usa felt the weight of her friend's gaze as Hotaru stared unblinkingly at her, her amethyst eyes hard and still, yet the silence still continued. After nearly a minute of waiting for the silence to end the young Moon-Princess started to speak.<p>"Hotaru you know I can't . . . "She began only to be interrupted before she could finish..<p>"Usa, I'm sorry, but things have been so weird today. I need to know. Let's talk about this and figure out just what you CAN tell me.." Hotaru seemed to deflate as she conceded part of her argument. "I should know better, it just so frustrating when you know something and can't tell me, but surely there are some things you can . . . " Her voice trailed off once again leaving the pair in silence.<p>"You'll tell me as much as you can won't you?" Hotaru nearly pleaded, again her expressive eyes showing the uncertainty and fear lurking in her soul.<p>Usa nodded, a quick fierce motion as she rushed to envelope her friend in a bone-crushing hug clear evidence of her relationship to her mother Tsukino Usagi.<p>Hotaru resisted the hug for a moment, stiffening in surprise before returning it with one of her own. Even now such displays often took her by surprise, even now she was unused to comfort from anyone other than her mama and papa.<p>Usa felt her friend tense then finally relax into the warm embrace. The young princess fought back tears as she realized just how fragile Hotaru's happiness really was. Though happy now, at least when she felt secure in the love of her family, Hotaru still lacked the emotional stability that Usa had grown up with and it was times like this that the lack showed.<p>"Don't worry. It all works out." Usa comforted her friend. "It all works out."<p>"R-r-really," Hotaru stuttered, "I get scared sometimes, and so much has happened today."<p>"Tell me all about it," Usa started to release the hug, but before she could complete the action her mischievous nature kicked in and she succumbed to the dark impulse plaguing her. "Well, there are some things that I guess won't hurt to tell you." She purred, pulling the dark haired senshi back into a full glomp, then licked her friends ear.<p>Hotaru stiffened, shocked into immobility, her expressive amethyst eyes widening to the size of saucers.<p>"Us . . .Us . . . Usa, What!" she nearly screamed.<p>"Now, now Hotaru-chan. You said you wanted to know some things about the future." Usa's tone dropped into a throaty purr.<p>"WHATTTT!" Hotaru finally found her voice as she yelped her question.<p>Chibi-Usa licked her friends ear once again, before finally, reluctantly releasing her glomp. She still held tightly to her friend's hand and guided her toward the bed. Gently pushing the stunned Hotaru down to the bed and into a seated position, Usa plopped down next to her friend assuming a cross-legged position and facing Hotaru never releasing the hold she had on Hotaru's hand.<p>"This is fun!" the future princess crowed inwardly as she watched Hotaru trying to pull herself back together.<p>"Are you okay Hotaru-chan?"<p>"Uhmm, What?" Hotaru answered absently as she tried to control her emotions and bring herself back into at least the semblance of calm.<p>"I asked if you were okay?"<p>"Why did you do that?" Hotaru answered cautiously. "Dammit why did Usa do that?" she pondered as she waited for an answer.<p>"Wellllll." Usa teased, "You were so uptight that I wanted to see if I could get you to relax."<p>"Relax! I'm certainly not relaxed now!"<p>"Oh really," The purr was back, "So I take it you liked it then?" the words were in the form of a question, but the tone showed that they were instead an assertion of fact."<p>"Eeepp," Hotaru paused again nervous and uncertain as to the best way to reply. Despite Haruka-papa and Michiru mama's relationship she had never (well other than in a couple of embarrassing hentai dreams) thought about another girl in "that" way. Despite her shock however, Hotaru had to admit the thrill that shot though her body when Usa licked and then kissed her ear. Her normally pale face was hot and colored a shade that was normally reserved for overripe tomatoes<p>"I'm sorry," Usa apologized, though once again her tone made it unclear as to whether this was a true apology or not. "But I did get your attention didn't I?" The sultry tone was broken by the giggles that Usa couldn't contain any longer, the look on Hotaru's face had been sooooo shocked.<p>"You certainly did." Hotaru conceded.<p>"Don't worry. We've . . . I mean you've got a fiancé waiting for you in Crystal Tokyo."<p>Hotaru's mind latched onto her friend's words. "A fiancé? Really?"<p>Hotaru's mind reeled as she considered what Usa told her. A fiancé, she had a fiancé in the future, someone who loved her and wanted to be with HER. The words took on a life all their own as Hotaru felt an intense relief. Michiru-mama was right, she would find someone to love her just as she was, who would accept her . . . and her gifts.<p>"Yes you do, and no I can't tell you any more than . . . " Usa agreed, while attempting to shut down any further inquiries into the matter.<p>"Wait a minute." Hotaru interrupted. "Did you just say We've got a fiancé?"<p>"Oooppps." Usa muttered. "No wonder Setsuna has so much trouble with this stuff."<p>"You did didn't you. You said WE'VE got a fiancé." Hotaru pressed.<p>"I really can't say anything else Hotaru, sorry." Usa muttered uneasily, not sure that she liked how Hotaru's hands were clenching and unclenching..<p>Hotaru took a deep breath, counted to ten then sighed, she knew that the pink haired girl was probably right. Kami knows that she'd heard Setsuna harp on just this topic many many times. Besides, while from all appearances the two of them had somehow reached an agreement on the fiancé issue, at least Usa didn't appear to be upset about the arrangement.<p>Watching her friends reactions Usa grinned she could practically see the gears turning in Hotaru's mind. She also knew why Setsuna enjoyed this so much. If Hotaru only knew the truth. Yes they were both engaged to a wonderful boy, a prince in fact. He was the great-grandson of Michiru's sword sensei, and the Second Prince of the Jurian Empire. There wasn't going to be any problem with outliving him . . . and he was sooooo cute to.<p>"Okay." Hotaru conceded grudgingly, but then returned to the attack.<p>"You still haven't told me about mama and papa."<p>Usa groaned, she had hoped that the news of a fiancé would derail Hotaru's thought process and stop the questions for a while.<p>"Give me a minute." She commanded. "I need to think about this. I don't know exactly when some of this came out so I'm afraid to just tell you."<p>"I guess that's fair." Hotaru grudgingly agreed though her tone made it clear that she did NOT want to agree with the statement.<p>After a few minutes of intense quiet Usa continued. "Why don't you tell me what happened today and I'll see if that help me figure out what you already know and how much I can tell you.<p>"Well, It started out this morning. I was feeling a little down 'cause the kids at school are still teasing me a lot. So I asked Michiru-mama if we could walk to school together." A momentary giggle broke her otherwise solemn expression. "I love Haruka- papa, but sometimes she's just so . . . dense."<p>Usa giggled in response. "Yeah, and that's one thing that doesn't seem to change. She's always getting into trouble with Michiru because of that."<p>Usa watched as her friend finally began to relax as she continued her retelling of the day's events. Hotaru apparently had quite an exciting day. She had met several people who took her abilities in stride and accepted her as she was. The young princess envied her friend the experience. While being a princess was often great, it could was often quite confining as well. She was expected to act certain ways, to always be the princess, to act the part of heir to the throne. Sometimes she just wanted to be free from all that and here in the past with her friends she could be herself. She could be Chibi-Usa just another normal girl and could leave the princess behind her at least for a little while.<p>"I'm worried about mama." Hotaru finished uncertainly.<p>Hotaru sniffled a bit before continuing. "I'm afraid Kasumi's an old girlfriend. I mean I've never heard mama talk about any other girls. It's like Haruka-papa is the only one she's ever really been interested in. But now that I think about it mama's so pretty that would be hard to believe." Hotaru's voice nearly broke as she continued. "And when Kasumi hugged her today she looked so . . . "<p>"So what?" Usa asked softly when Hotaru stopped.<p>"I don't know exactly." Hotaru murmured frustratedly. "Like I said, when we got there this gorgeous woman glomped mama in a hug that would make your mom jealous."<p>"Wow." Usa responded. "And how did your mom take it."<p>"That's the strange part. You know how she is kinda . . . " Hotaru paused again searching for the right words. It wasn't like her mama was unfeeling or anything, at times she could be downright hentai in her displays with Haruka-papa. Usually though Michiru was more reserved than that, really only letting her mischievous nature out when at home or with friends, and despite never having admitted such Hotaru knew that the Inner Scouts were considered to be among her friends by her mama. In public though Michiru usually limited herself to less . . . exuberant . . . displays.<p>"Mama's usually kinda . . . private with her feelings." Hotaru finished.<p>"Yeah."<p>"Well she wasn't like that today. She hugged Kasumi back and when they talked it was like they loved each other." This time Hotaru broke down, she tried to fight the worry that was filling her, but despite her best efforts tears trickled from between her closed eyelids and trailed down her cheeks.<p>"Mama looked so content, so happy. Like someone who had lost something important and after a very long time finds it again." Hotaru's eyes gleamed with unshed tears talked.<p>"That's good isn't it?"<p>"I don't know." Hotaru wailed. "What if she leaves us?"<p>"Don't worry Hotaru. Everything will be alright."<p>"Are you sure?" Hotaru questioned still sniffling slightly.<p>Chibi-Usa nodded, once again enveloping her friend in a comforting hug. This time however she made sure that friendship was all she offered.<p>"I'm sure." Usa didn't know everything that would occur between now and her life in Crystal Tokyo. But she did know enough about Haruka and Michiru to know that they were true soul mates. That by itself didn't necessarily mean that they would be able to stay together though. Usa had seen with her own eyes the problems that her own mother and father had with their relationship here in the past. The fact that they were soul-mates didn't always equate to smooth sailing in their personal life, and when this type of relationship died it was worse than if they had never met as each would almost instinctively compare everyone else to the mate that had been lost, and everyone else would be somehow lacking.<p>"Now tell me more about what happened today." Usa ordered taking on an imperious tone, as if she were Queen of the Moon Kingdom already.<p>"Well, like I said Elder Cologne was very interesting, even if she was kinda scary." Hotaru resumed her tale. "She said she was over 300 years old." With a giggle Hotaru added, "and she looks it too."<p>"So what do you think of the others you met today?"<p>Hotaru paused once again, "That's what's making this so hard. I like them, even Kasumi. Not one of them cared that I can heal." Hotaru corrected herself before continuing, "No, that's not quite right, they care, but they think it's cool that I can heal people. Shampoo even said she wished she could do that, she said it would make training a lot easier if she could heal herself when she finished."<p>"I'm just worried. When Kasumi and mama talked it was like she and mama were sharing secrets right in front of me."<p>"What kind of secrets?"<p>"I don't know, maybe that they were in love, or maybe something else. I don't know, it was like listening to only one side of a phone conversation.  You can kinda guess what's being said but you don't really know for sure. That's why when you called mama sensei I caught it."<p>The once and future princess nodded slightly. Now she knew when she was. Apparently Michiru's "double life" hadn't been found out . . . yet. Usa wondered just what the next few days would be like. From the teasing that Haruka still occasionally took in Crystal Tokyo, the young princess knew that Haruka's reaction must've been something else. She also knew that another threat was about to surface, one that would test all the senshi as well as the bonds of trust that they had forged so far.<p>Apparently it had been quite a shock for Haruka to find out that "quiet Neptune" was a grandmaster in the martial arts, probably the best of her generation. Yes, the next few days were going to be interesting indeed, and Haruka was proud. For a long time the senshi of Uranus had been the best, now the title was about to pass to another. Just how would Haruka react to that?<p>"I don't know exactly Hotaru, but I do know this we can help them get though it. They are still together back in Crystal Tokyo. Once again Chibi-Usa had to fight back the giggles. Yes indeed they were together, and she could hardly wait until she COULD reveal some of the things she knew, the look on Haruka's face would be priceless, if she didn't pass out first.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma looked at herself critically, the events of the day making the blue- tressed woman who stared back at her seem a stranger. It had taken her years to get used to, truly used to being a girl, in fact it had literally taken growing up a second time. However, the woman she was now made all of it worthwhile, well that and Haruka, her lover and in so many ways her life.<p>Ranma sighed contentedly, she really did love Haruka, even though the blond could be so dense sometimes. At that thought Ranma had to choke back a severe case of the giggles, Haruka sometimes even made Ranma look observant about his relationships. Though she supposed that if she were to be fair about this observation that was probably overstating the case at least a little. No, even though she had been reminded all to often today of who she had been and what she had given up, she wouldn't trade her life now for the old one for anything she would never go back to the madness that was Ranma's life. Her life now could be and often was chaotic, but she had a purpose. . . . and a family<p>No, the woman looking gazing at her from the mirror was everything that Ranma/Ranko was not. Michiru was elegant, the very epitome of culture and refinement. The old Ranma would never have admitted (even to himself) that a world outside of martial arts existed. He would never admit an interest in the things that Michiru had grown to love. He would've scorned the violin, the classes she took and the education she enjoyed. Still there were traces of the old Ranma, the martial arts were still very important to her, family and duty.<p>Still though, Michiru was a far cry from the tomboyish Ranko. Ranko was a tomboy who refused to even consider being feminine. Wearing a sports bra was an anathema, and she would rather be dead that caught wearing the delicate (and to be quite honest erotic) work of lace and fabric she sported now. No Ranko would never be caught in the lingerie that Michiru favored, but despite the nostalgia generated by today's activities her days of wearing men's boxers were long over.<p>The serene smile turned sultry, one more suited to a model than a tomboy as she contemplated the evening yet to come. That is if the model was one posing for a hentai magazine. No Ranko would never wear an outfit like this, a racy blue bra and a garter-belt with silk stockings of a slightly softer shade of blue.<p>The outfit laying on the bed was not much better, from Ranko's old point of view. The only similarity with the outfits that Ranma/Ranko wore was the silk fabric. The dress itself was an evening gown which molded to her body like a second skin, shoulders were left bare and the neckline plunged to show her abundant features off to their best effect, yet which was still decent. The skirt itself was short and barely reached her mid-thigh, with a slit up one side that nearly reached her hip.<p>It wouldn't take much of an effort to give Haruka a show all the while maintaining so far as any observers could tell the proper restraint. The only consideration that she gave to "Ranko" were the flats that she would wear, even now shoes she could fight or run in were important to her and while she had learned to fight in heels as a result of her senshi uniform, when a "civilian" she preferred something a bit more practical.<p>Ranma's face morphed into an even naughtier expression as she slipped into the dress while considering the possibilities for fun this evening. Haruka wasn't going to know what hit her, not that the tomboy would have anything to complain about.<p>Dressed to the nines Ranma picked up the matching purse and glided from the room, her hips swaying sensuously.<p>She knocked on her daughter's door, interrupting the pair plotting inside.<p>"Hotaru-chan?"<p>"Yes mama." A muffled voiced answered from within.<p>"I'm about ready to get Haruka and leave for dinner. Can I come in for a minute?"<p>"Yes mama."<p>Ranma heard light footsteps then the sound of a lock being turned before the door opened revealing her daughter.<p>A sly grin gracing her face Ranma looked at Usa-chan perched on the bed with a guilty look on her face.<p>"I'm not interrupting anything am I?" she began with a sly tone in her voice.<p>To her surprise Hotaru blushed furiously, before beginning her denials.<p>"Mama! It's not like that."<p>A quick look at Chibi-Usa confirmed that the young princess was coloring as well.<p>"Hmmm." Ranma answered thoughtfully, "Well don't do anything that I wouldn't do."<p>"As if there's much you wouldn't do." Ranma heard the nearly inaudible mutter from both her daughter and Usa.<p>"I heard that." Ranma laughed, causing the pair to start, then cast guilty looks at each other.<p>"Mama!" Hotaru appeared to be desperately fighting her inclination to blush and began fidgeting in embarrassment.<p>"Sorry Hotaru-chan, I was only teasing. Though . . . "<p>"Mama! Stop it."<p>"Yes dear." Ranma deadpanned her reply. "I was only teasing."<p>Leaning over she gave Hotaru and peck on the cheek then with a wink turned away.<p>"There's food and soda in the fridge," Ranma offered, "and I left some money for take-out if you'd rather do that. Haruka and I will be back later. I'll check in on the two of you when we get back."<p>Still laughing she walked away. Life was good. A frown flitted across her face as she considered what was yet to come. She just hoped that it stayed good. Tomorrow would be the first in a series of steps to regain what she had lost, Ranma just hoped that she wouldn't lose what she had while finding some of her past.<p>As expected Haruka had lost what patience she had with waiting and Ranma found her watching TV in the living room. The senshi of Neptune took a moment to gaze at her lover. Haruka looked positively handsome in her tuxedo, she would be turning many a girls eye tonight, and if the past were any indication of the future Haruka would revel in it. The blond also appeared to be totally oblivious to anything other than the martial arts tournament on the box. Taking advantage of the situation, Ranma ghosted across the floor, wrapped her arms around Haruka and give her a soft kiss on the neck.<p>"Are you ready lover?"<p>"Just a minute Michiru, the match is almost over." Haruka replied distractedly.<p>Ranma took this in attention as a challenge and tightened her hug, her warm breath and throaty whisper designed to draw attention away form the TV and to herself. She had spent quite a while getting ready and now her date was more interested in the TV than in her.<p>She watched as Haruka squirmed on the couch, trying to ignore the kisses as she watched the tournament's final match.<p>"Michiru, I said just a minute."<p>"But Haruka," Ranma pouted seductively, "I'm ready to go and you promised me dinner."<p>"No I didn't." Haruka replied somewhat grumpily, "You made me promise you dinner when you announced your plans for the evening."<p>"Fine." Now it was Ranma's turn to complain, "But you know Azami's going to win. You told me she always wins."<p>"Yeah." Haruka admitted, "But I want to see her win, her sword style is nearly perfect ... besides I didn't think you ever really listened when I talked martial arts." Haruka's attention was still on the TV and not her mate.<p>Ranma gave in, and with a devastatingly cute pout settled next to Haruka on the couch and leaned into Haruka's taller frame. Ranma didn't need to see the TV to know what was coming, so she instead spent her energy in snuggling.<p>A few moments later and with a final flurry of strikes the match was indeed over with Azami the winner.<p>Haruka appeared almost surprised to find Michiru cuddled next to her.<p>"Man she's good," Haruka crowed. "She's the best sword master to compete since Saotome Nodoka."<p>"Really," Ranma answered absently rising to her feet and pulling her larger companion with her.<p>"Yeah, and she's so mysterious too," Haruka continued. "She never gives interviews herself. All we really know is that Saotome Nodoka was her sensei, and then she studied with Nodoka's sensei for a while. Well and the fact that she hasn't lost an important match in years. Even getting a picture of her is hard. It's almost like she disguises herself. In one tournament she's a blond, in the next a brunette."<p>"Sounds strange." Ranma answered with a laugh.<p>Only her years of practice allowed Ranma to keep a straight face at the plaintive note in Haruka's voice. "And she's never taken a student, and believe me it's not from a lack of people asking, and she's so cute too."<p>"Now Haruka." Ranma teased, "Keep it up and I might get jealous. "And that would definitely interfere with my plans for you this evening."<p>"Plans?" Haruka laughed, "and just what are those plans?"<p>"Treat me nice enough and you might find out."<p>Haruka laughed, as she finally really noticed her love for the first time this evening."<p>"Wow you look delicious . . . I mean good tonight."<p>"I kinda liked your first thought." Ranma laughed throatily, "But we need to go, our reservations at Chizuma's are in twenty minutes."<p>It was a short walk to the garage and Haruka's car. The pair settled in as Haruka fired up the horses.<p>Ranma waited until they were on the road, then took Haruka's hand and placed it in he lap relishing the warm feel, softly stroking her lover's hand, and enjoying the blush that her actions produced.<p>"Feeling good tonight are we." Haruka purred,<p>Ranma only laughed as they sped toward the restaurant.<p>The trip didn't take long and Haruka reluctantly, very reluctantly turned the keys to her baby over to the valet. The restaurant itself was crowded, a line already formed and the bar crowded. Chizuma's was a well-known five star establishment popular with those in the know. They however didn't have to wait as the reservations had been confirmed long before.<p>Ranma reveled in the jealous looks she was getting from the ladies as Haruka escorted her in. There was no doubt in her mind that Haruka was the handsomest "guy" in the crowd and her opinion was obviously shared by more than a few of the women. She studiously ignored the appraising looks she herself was getting from nearly all the men ... and a few of the ladies present. Instead she took Haruka's arm possessively and melded herself to the taller blond, staking her claim clearly and indicating her willingness to protect that claim.<p>The maitre de, a distinguished gentleman with silvered hair escorted them to their table. Ranma had specifically asked for table as it afforded a good view out while remaining somewhat out of the public eye. It was the perfect location for an evening of fun teasing and titillating her lover.<p>After a brief conversation with their escort and a discussion of the wine they were left alone.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Haruka fidgeted a bit as she settled in. This place was definitely more Michiru's style than hers. The blond tomboy felt more at home at the track or in one of the restaurants or bars that the other racers frequented than in a place like this. She just wasn't used to this type of luxury, her family was comfortably middle class and seldom frequented these types of places. Michiru on the other hand, was used to this, her family had money and weren't afraid to use it. Though she knew that Michiru was adopted that didn't change the fact that she had grown up with advantages and a certain "station" in life that she herself had not.<p>It was times like these that the differences were made apparent. Haruka felt more than a little out of place. Yes she could fit in, but it wasn't her cup of tea, her companion however treated this as nothing more than ordinary, nothing more than her due. Sometimes it made her wonder just what Michiru saw in her. It couldn't be just that their sexual preferences, Michiru could have her pick of the ladies, yet her aqua- tressed companion was with her, and gave every indication of wanting to stay with her.<p>Still there was something going on. Haruka may not have appeared to have heard Setsuna this morning, but she had. There was something going on with either Michiru or Hotaru or possibly both, and it worried her more than a little. When Setsuna began talking of secrets and things best revealed it made her nervous. Just what had the senshi of Pluto been talking about?<p>Haruka shook her head as she heard Michiru tell or ask her something, and from the glint in Michiru's eyes it was something that she'd find interesting. Not only that but ignoring Michiru when she was in a teasing mode was not something to be done lightly. A licentious smile grew as she recalled the last time that Michiru had been ignored when making a suggestion. Who knew that the little minx was so . . . inventive, and while the activity was nothing that she'd have come up with on her own, she hadn't minded Michiru's little game when it had been revealed. No, she hadn't minded it at all.<p>"I'm sorry Michiru, I was still thinking about the tournament," Haruka lied.<p>Oblivious she might be most of the time, but even she new better than to talk about her fear that Michiru might someday realize just how different they really were when Michiru was dressed to the nines and sitting across from her.<p>"Guess what I'm not wearing." Ranma purred enjoying the look of dawning comprehension on the tomboy's face.<p>Haruka for her part stared at the vision that was Michiru, then swallowed nervously as sudden warmth filled her soul. How did Michiru manage to do this? Just about the time Haruka thought she had her figured out Michiru would pull something new. Michiru was defiantly a heady brew, and one she hoped with all she had to be able to enjoy for the rest of her life.<p>Haruka stared as Ranma leaned forward seductively, the silk dress making the already gorgeous woman even more sexy than normal, and that was quite an accomplishment in and of itself.<p>"Just what do you have planned?" she finally stammered. Even as she fought for calm Haruka thanked the Kami for bringing Michiru into her life. Yes she'd had other girlfriends, but none like her. Michiru was an often perplexing mix of restraint and daring. You never knew what went on that calm façade of hers until it was to late. Not that she was complaining. Before Michiru she'd had lovers, several in fact, but none that seemed to fill the void in her soul like the vision in blue before her.<p>"That you will find out later."<p>Haruka shuddered in anticipation, definitely a heady brew indeed. Still, she hadn't been Michiru's lover for the last couple of years for nothing. Something was on her companions mind, probably several somethings. While to most Michiru had a poker face that professionals would envy, Haruka could read deeper than the mask and she new that something important was on Michiru's mind, something more than just a wild time later tonight.<p>"I'm looking forward to that discovery." Haruka purred her own reply. Then in challenge continued. "I just hope you can back up your promise.<p>She shivered at the sultry look that was her only answer.<p>The conversation was interrupted before it could go any further as their waitress, a rather attractive and tasty dish herself came to take their order. Haruka tried her best to keep her eyes off the waitress and on her companion. If there was anything that could ruin the evening it would be Michiru catching her ogling another woman. While the senshi of Neptune usually just laughed and called her a hentai, there were times when it didn't go over nearly so well, and for the life of her Haruka still couldn't tell what would set Michiru off. She often wondered if Michiru knew herself, and occasionally wondered if the smaller woman just acted jealous to make her squirm and beg forgiveness. Though to be honest the making up after a fight was sweet as well.<p>Innocuous small talk filled the silence as they waited for their meal. Haruka didn't want to spoil the mood by asking questions she was afraid that Michiru didn't want to answer, but she was very curious about what had happened today. Michiru skipping school was unusual in itself, and for her to have encouraged Hotaru to ditch school with her was nearly unheard of, but the senshi of Uranus wasn't sure how to breach the topic. Additionally, she could tell that Michiru was hiding something else. Michiru had been moody for the last few weeks, moving from one emotion to another with an abruptness that was unlike the normally unflappable woman. Something told her that this weekend was going to be very critical, despite her act at normalcy, Michiru was giving out signals that something big was up. What it was she didn't know. She'd just have to trust Michiru and hope that everything worked out.<p>She knew that Michiru would eventually talk to her, at least she hoped that she would, until then she would have to simply trust the other woman. The trust was there, she trusted Michiru with her very life when the fought the Negaverse, yet at times she still felt there were thoughts going on in Michiru's mind that the other didn't share with her. She just have to be patient, eventually Michiru would share (at least some of ) what was on her mind.<p>The meal finally arrived at it was as good as Chizuma's reputation promised. However, she couldn't help but notice that Michiru was more pushing the food around on her plate than actually enjoying the meal, and that was unusual as well. .<p>Still she was surprised at the more serious tone and nervous expression on her lover's face as she finally decided to talk about more than the "safe" topics they'd been discussing prior to the food's arrival.<p>"Haruka?"<p>"Yes." Haruka pulled her attention from her own thoughts to the words of her lover.<p>"It's been fun raising Hotaru hasn't it?" Michiru asked softly, not looking up from where she was chasing the noodles around the plate. "You've liked being her papa haven't you?"<p>Haruka smiled here at least was a safe topic, for indeed she loved Hotaru as if she was her own daughter and she was her father.<p>"She's a great kid." Haruka agreed.<p>Michiru looked up, "Do you ever think about us having kids?"<p>Haruka's eyes widened, she suspected that she looked like a deer caught in the headlights of an approaching car. This was NOT what she had been expecting. More flirting and teasing yes, the talk of children no. Especially not with the longing that she heard so clearly in the aqua- tressed woman's voice.
