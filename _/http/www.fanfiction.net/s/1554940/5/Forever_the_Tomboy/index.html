</div>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer<p>Forever the Tomboy Ch. 5 – Dinner and Dancing?<p>A/N – Still not yet to the flashbacks chapter(s) but some more glimpses of what has been and what is to come.<p>"Do you ever think about us having kids?"<p>The words echoed in Haruka's mind as she tried to grasp what her companion had actually said. Understanding the words themselves was easy, it had after all been a simple straightforward question. What was neither easy nor simple, however, was figuring out what brought the subject up at all. They were both young and had literally hundreds of years to think about children. Unless of course they died trying to bring Crystal Tokyo into fruition. All indications were (given that Chibi-Usa knew them in the future) that they would survive until then, so what was behind this?<p>The blond senshi searched her memories trying to recall anything that could've caused this situation, this question she was faced with now. She searched and failed to think of anything that would've warned her before now that her lover so desired a child of her own.<p>Given that the question appeared to come out of no-where, Haruka had no immediate reply and fell back on her experience as a senshi when the unexpected arose. When faced with a completely new or foreign situation (or enemy) Sailor Uranus habitually employed one of two tactics. She either attacked immediately or hung back trying to buy time to assess the situation and come up with a plan. The problem was that, of the two Outer senshi Michiru was the thinker, the planner; she herself nearly always preferred the frontal assault option.<p>While Haruka was not known for being subtle, and indeed she did normally prefer option one over option two, even she knew that there were times when a good offense made a problem worse instead of better. She KNEW that attacking in this situation could be bad, very bad. If Michiru was serious and not pulling one of her pranks a verbal assault would create a serious rift in their relationship. Haruka would rather get a root canal without anaesthetic than risk losing the blue-eyed woman sitting so seductively across from her. Michiru was more than just her lover, she was part of her soul, her very life. Nothing scared Haruka more than the possibility of losing Kaiou Michiru, not even the possibility of losing Crystal Tokyo though she'd not admit that weakness in front of the others.<p>So, with her mouth still gaping open in shock Haruka desperately sought to remain calm and desperately dove into one of the few "soft" arts she knew and sought peace through a martial arts meditation mantra, hoping for the peace it normally brought her.<p>Swallowing nervously she grabbed her wineglass and took a long pull of the effervescent liquid, treating the rather expensive vintage as if it were nothing more than a wino's pick-me-up and the cheapest of wines.<p>"Ummm," she started to speak, her voice several octaves higher than normal and with a squeak that sounded much more like Tsukino Usagi, than she cared for. Hearing the squeal in her own voice Haruka stopped, took a deep breath and then continued.<p>"Did you say that you wanted us to have kids?"<p>The tuxedo clad woman watched as Michiru continued to stare at the half eaten plate of noodles in front of her, scrutinizing the food as if the secrets of the universe could be discovered in the cooling mixture of noodles and sauce.<p>"Not exactly," Michiru spoke softly, with a hesitance in her voice that was rarely seen or heard.<p>"Not exactly?" Haruka responded astounded by the display of nerves. She'd seen Michiru perform in front of a full auditorium, one filled with noted music critics and professional musicians without displaying the slightest hint of fear. She'd watched as Sailor Neptune faced death for her Queen and accepted it as the price of loyalty with less trepidation than she was displaying in this simple conversation. Deep down Haruka felt the subtle glow of love, the flame of her passion with Michiru warming her. Obviously this was important to her lover and what was important to Michiru was important to her.<p>"What I actually asked was whether or not you ever thought about us having kids."<p>Haruka swallowed, trying to calm the butterflies in her stomach.<p>"Ummm," she began formulating an answer ever so eloquently. "I'm uhhh, not exactly equipped to help in that department." Haruka answered with a shaky laugh, even though no question had been asked this time. Trying to inject a bit of levity the she continued, "and neither are you."<p>When Michiru looked up the longing was clear in the sapphire eyes. Haruka saw that Michiru was serious about this, very serious. The sometimes oblivious Haruka was nearly floored by the clarity of the emotions she was seeing. Her lover normally presented a calm, almost emotionless façade to the world, only really letting go with her family or when she was in the throes of passion. But right here, right now that mask was not just down . . . it was GONE. Now the question was what effect Michiru's desire for a child or children would have on their relationship, and what effect denying that desire might have. Warring with the love she felt was more than a little nervousness, and the faintest beginnings of anger. What would Michiru do if she rejected the idea, would she seek a child elsewhere? Would she perhaps seek another lover, a man who could give her what she wanted?<p>Haruka might be oblivious to the "softer" emotions at times, but she wasn't stupid. She'd heard Hotaru and Chibi-Usa talking earlier, and she too wondered who this Kasumi was, would this Kasumi be willing to make a family with Michiru if she didn't? Shaking her head Haruka turned away, at least momentarily from her fears and back to her companion.<p>"But, if we could..."<p>"I've never really thought about it." Haruka admitted. She'd never seen Michiru look so vulnerable as she did right now. It both scared her, and quite frankly it also turned her on. Haruka wanted nothing more than to gather the smaller woman in her arms and hold on, showing her love in a way that was clearer than words.<p>"I mean I like girls, always have." Haruka continued. "So I've never really thought about it."<p>"Never?" once again the voice came ever so softly, with a slight tinge of sadness underlying the words.<p>"Well," Haruka reluctantly, but honestly, conceded, "Maybe once or twice when Hotaru was still a baby. You always looked so happy taking care of her."<p>"So if there was a way for us to have children you might be willing to?"<p>Haruka sighed, "I never could deny you anything, you know that." She answered. "Just what do you have planned in that sneaky mind of yours."<p>This time it was Michiru that sighed, her warm breath caressing Haruka's cheek as it wafted across the table. "I don't want you 'giving in' and agreeing to this just because I want a baby of our own. It has to be something we both want, and we'd need to talk to Hotaru as well." Michiru paused before continuing, this time with a fierce note of protectiveness in her voice. "I don't want her thinking even for a moment that we are trying to replace her."<p>Looking into Michiru's eyes as the silence continued Haruka saw something . . . break . . . she saw the longing start to fade, and the loss hurt her. Even though she was still more than half stunned by the conversation, the blond knew that Michiru meant what she said. If she didn't want children then Michiru would give up this dream. Gathering the remnants of her courage Haruka interrupted he lover before she could speak further. She reached out and took one of Michiru's hands in her own.<p>"I didn't say I didn't want kids. I just said that I couldn't given one to you."<p>Haruka's emotions were in turmoil. She knew that she couldn't give Michiru what she wanted. They were both girls and despite all the miracles of modern technology she'd never heard of anyone making a child from two female eggs. Men might not attract her, but she did know that you needed one to make a baby at least as things stood now.<p>An unfamiliar emotion began to grow inside the senshi of Uranus, the emotion of fear. She knew, or at least thought she did, that Neptune loved her. Indeed if you'd asked this question of her before tonight she would've affirmed that love with no hesitation and no real uncertainty.<p>Still, doubts long held, but firmly quashed began to raise their ugly head.  Yes, Michiru was her lover and had been for nearly two years, but she also knew that Michiru had been a virgin when they became lovers. As beautiful as Kaiou Michiru was she had never been with anyone before they made love together. Neptune had never been with another woman, let alone another man in that way, never surrendered her all to another before Ten'ou Haruka. When they had first decided to go all the way, Michiru had been as nervous as hell. It still shocked her, and gave her more than a little thrill to know that she had been the first to know Michiru completely, the first to bring her to that place of ultimate ecstasy, the first to taste her inner self.<p>Haruka had no doubt that Michiru was interested in women. A salacious grin grew on her face as she considered just how much the aqua-tressed woman enjoyed making love to her, the Princess of Neptune hell she was practically insatiable once she got started.<p>Still the fear had always lingered somewhere in the dark recesses of her mind that Michiru might some-day want to find out what it was like to be with a man. The fear was small, nearly non-existent but it was still there. Haruka didn't really think that Michiru would leave her for a man, but could she be sure seeing the desire so evident now in her sparkling blue eyes?"<p>The paranoid thoughts flashed through the senshi's mind in a few short seconds, as she realized just how ridiculous that thought actually was. Not only had she never seen Michiru look at a man with desire, her companion had on more than one occasion expressed more than a little distaste for the idea.<p>Her own personal experience bore that out. Even when they had become lovers it had taken a long time before the senshi of Neptune would even consider using any 'toys' that looked like the male organ, and an even longer time before she finally consented to using them. Haruka had at first thought Michiru had been raped. The strength of her reaction the first time the use of a dildo had been suggested as a way to increase their mutual passion had shown more than Neptune probably realized. But even that didn't seem quite right. It was strange actually, none of the women she'd been with before had anywhere near that reaction, none of her prior lovers had looked so scared and fearful at the thought of being "filled" while making love. A few had detested the thought of doing it with a man, but they didn't shy away from the same adventures with another woman. Michiru on the other hand had acted with an almost phobic fear, and had nearly become physically sick the first time she had brought out one of those toys.<p>"Haruka? Have I lost you again?"<p>Once again the senshi of Uranus dragged her thoughts back from her own musings and back to the present, and back to the still unanswered question her lover had posed. Gathering her courage Haruka answered.<p>* * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma toyed with her meal, for once her appetite was non-existent. True, as Michiru she no longer gulped her food or gorged herself like say, Tsukino Usagi, but she still needed copious amounts of calories to fuel her martial artist body. Since she didn't want anyone to know just how much she did eat she supplemented her meals with high carb supplements like shakes and power bars and took other supplements as well. Those provided the calories she needed and still allowed her to eat like a "normal" person. One thing that hadn't changed though was her enjoyment of food. It was just that in her second life as Michiru she limited herself to smaller portions except for those occasions when she was out alone.<p>Tonight however her appetite had deserted her. Even the five star cuisine that was before her couldn't hold her attention, instead all of her focus was on her lover. What Ten'ou Haruka had to say about this question was important, very important to her. Her life now was better than it had ever been. Even the danger she faced as a Scout only heightened her enjoyment of life. They had a wonderful life together, and yes she loved Haruka, Hotaru and even Setsuna more than life itself, but she still dreamed of another child, one of her own.<p>Still, now that she'd actually raised the issue with her love, she wondered if she was pushing for too much to quick. The look of utter shock on Haruka's face had frightened her a bit, okay she admitted to herself it had frightened her more than just a bit.<p>She had planned this for a long time. A momentary smirk crossed her face at that thought, there were many who would never believe that Saotome Ranma could ever think ahead. Perhaps they were right, until the very last of his days in Nerima she had been a creature of reaction always responding to situations thrust upon her instead of taking charge and working to stop problems before the ballooned into catastrophe. Growing up "Michiru" had changed all of that. Before she had "exiled" herself in the past she had sworn an oath to herself to take full advantage of the opportunities given her by her new life. She had not only decided to learn she had embraced the chance to learn, to think and to grow. While she sometime still reacted instinctively to problems now outside of combat, now she was just as apt to look for a way to prevent problems before they happened, and to face them immediately when they did happen instead of trying to put them off in the vague hope they would go away or somehow solve themselves.<p>Even so the best of plans were not perfect and it had taken her quite a while to build up the courage necessary to finally ask Haruka what she thought of a child of their own. The desire to ask this question had been there ever since they had adopted Hotaru. Saturn's 's growth spurt, which had turned their daughter from a baby to a middle-school student literally overnight had merely added fuel to the fire. To her own shock and some dismay she had loved every minute of taking care of a baby. Nothing had kept her down, not the feedings, the diapers or the lack of sleep. Sometimes it had been rough, but every minute had filled her with feelings that nearly overwhelmed her. Feelings of love and a fierce protectiveness for her child that she would never lose.<p>Yes she loved Hotaru, but she hadn't been able to raise her the way she would a child of her own. She wanted another child, not to replace Hotaru, no one could do that, but the thought of seeing her baby go though all the steps of childhood, having an opportunity to raise her child with love and compassion, to show him or her the ways of honor and duty from the very first was a desire she still had. Not to mention the thought of having a child with her lover and a sibling for Hotaru was almost a need for her.<p>Ranma was willing to give up that dream for Haruka or Hotaru, but she wasn't going give up until she tried.<p>Looking up from her meal, Ranma saw that Haruka had zoned out again. Keeping her lover on track (with this topic at least) was not easy. Ranma knew however that part of the problem was undoubtedly due to shock. Obviously this wasn't something that Haruka had ever seriously considered, and quite frankly Ranma had to admit that she'd pulled this one out of nowhere, at least as far as Haruka was concerned. It had clearly shocked her lover beyond he ability to answer rationally.<p>"Haruka? Have I lost you again?" she murmured nervously.<p>Ranma watched as patiently as she could while Haruka gathered her wits about her again. These long pauses were definitely something that she could do without, each second seemed an eternity as she waited for Haruka's answer. Finally, after several more agonizing seconds of quiet Haruka opened her mouth to speak, paused then with a look of determination tinged with a more than a bit of uncertainty Haruka finally spoke.<p>"Well, I guess we could adopt. Maybe Setsuna could help us out again. I'm not sure that we'd get approved otherwise," Haruka paused again, "all things considered that is." She included both in a vague if sweeping gesture.<p>"We could, but that isn't what I had in mind."<p>"Well," Haruka probed cautiously, "What do you have planned in that devious mind of yours?"<p>This time it was Ranma who paused, collecting her courage as she considered once again the options before them.<p>"Well, there are a couple of ways," she began tentatively, then firmed her resolve and continued. "There is a place in China that's cursed."<p>"Cursed?" Haruka interrupted.<p>"Yes, anyone or anything to bathe in the springs assumes the form of whatever drowned in that spring. There is a spring of the drowned boy..."<p>"You're NOT serious?." Haruka interjected, her voice rapidly rising. She looked at her lover's eyes and saw no mischief, only calm certainty. "Your are serious aren't you, I don't . . . "<p>"Let me finish love," Michiru broke in this time. Dammit why couldn't she let me finish, this is hard enough as it is the blue-eyed woman thought with some exasperation. "The springs are permanent, but there is a way to get a temporary curse."<p>"Temporary CURSE?"<p>"Yes, "Michiru answered softly, "but I don't think you'd have any interest in being a man." Michiru hesitated again, "and I'm not sure I could . . . could . . . "<p>Michiru took a deep breath, "could be with a man like that. . . even if . . . even if it was you, and I'd certainly never ask that of you." Then with a hint of her normal humor Michiru continued, "Besides I'm not sure how that would react to . . ." Michiru made a gesture as if reaching for a small object.<p>Haruka's relief at the last comment was easily read, though Michiru was confused as to why Haruka looked quite so relieved since the option had only been on the table for a minute or so.<p>"No what I was thinking was that we could go to a clinic and have one of your eggs fertilized and I could carry the baby. That way the baby would be part of both of us.<p>Besides Michiru teased, "I'm not sure how manly you'd look in your tux when you were eight months pregnant."<p>"Michiru-chan, " Haruka mock growled.<p>Smiling at her lover Ranma saw the relief once again. It was as if Haruka was relieved on several levels, the most obvious being that she wouldn't have to carry the child, but also as if some deeper worry had been released. What that worry might have been Ranma didn't know, but if it's disappearance made Haruka feel better she was all for it.<p>"Seriously love, I've checked it all out and it could be done pretty easily. The only real problem will be if Setsuna says we won't have the time free from our other duties. There's a clinic in Nerima that can do it and . . . ."<p>"And what?" Haruka pressed.<p>"Well, I've already gotten permission to use a donor's . . . seed," Michiru answered delicately. "His mother has agreed, and that way we know that we know the background on the donor and that he doesn't have any medical conditions to worry about. Ranma desperately hoped that Haruka would leave these details to her and not ask about the "father." Her lover often left what she called "the boring details" to her, and she reallllyyy hoped that this time would be no different. She really didn't want to reveal her past to Haruka. She would be devastated if she Haruka ever left her.<p>"Who is it?" Haruka asked, intrigued by the way her lover had already worked out the details. "Will either the father or his mother want to visit the child? After all it will sorta be her grandkid too?"<p>"Don't worry about that, the father is healthy and doesn't have any medical conditions we have to worry about. He'll be a fine donor." Michiru danced around the question.<p>"Yeah, but who is he?" Haruka pressed. "And who is she, and more importantly will she want to see the child?"<p>Michiru frowned, ignoring for the moment just how cute that made her look. It was obvious that Haruka had picked up on the fact that she was avoiding the question. One of the qualities that she so lover about Haruka was her determination, but right now she'd gladly trade that quality for the girls usual obliviousness.<p>She had really hoped that she could dance around this issue. Nodoka and Kasumi were the only ones from her "previous life" who knew of her life as Saotome Ranma, and to be honest she had not intended to ever confess to her mother. She hadn't been able to prevent herself from establishing a relationship with Nodoka once she was established in her new life. She had tried to be content with being Nodoka's "daughter" though friendship, but after being around her for the ten years "Ranma" was gone she had grown to love her mother even more than before. Shortly after Nodoka met Ranko she had taken the plunge knowing full well that the seppuku pledge might have to be fulfilled. She had revealed just who she was and why she had abandoned her life as Ranma to take up a new life as Michiru. Fortunately the years she had spent with Nodoka as Michiru visiting her "Auntie", training with her and just being herself had established a bond that Nodoka found stronger than the seppuku pledge. Nodoka had accepted her life as Michiru . . . once she had woken up from her fainting spell. She had told her mother everything, she had detailed just how horrific the problems were that "Ranma" had, and how much better her life was as Michiru. The hardest part was convincing Nodoka that paradox issues were the only reason that Michiru had not tried to have Nodoka adopt and raise her, that to have done so was to risk everything that the two had managed to build, not to mention what effect it might have on Crystal Tokyo. Ranma still wondered just how much Setsuna knew, and had spent more than one sleepless night trying to figure out how Ranma, born a boy and raised by that idiot Genma was also the reincarnation of Sailor Neptune, a woman from the Silver Millennium. Still that was an issue for another time, if she ever found an answer at all.<p>Musings aside she still realllly didn't want to have to answer the blond's question. Ranma had hoped, slim as that hope was, that Haruka wouldn't make the connection between her mom and the Saotome Nodoka the woman that Uranus practically worshiped as a sword goddess. She also knew her lover was aware of Saotome Ranma though Uranus's views on "Him" were not so favorable. His reputation in the martial arts community made Ranma a known figure. She knew that Haruka respected his abilities but she also new that Haruka despised the young martial artist as well believing him to be a "Player". The multiple fiancées matter had long ago soured her on "Him."<p>"Saotome Ranma," Ranma mumbled reluctantly, "and yes she will probably want to see the child."<p>"What was that?"<p>"Saotome Ranma." Ranma answered nearly inaudibly.<p>"You don't mean Playboy Saotome Ranma, son of THE Saotome Nodoka, the All Japan sword champion for 10 years running do you?" Haruka practically yelled the question, drawing unwanted attention from the nearby tables. "Hell, until she quit active competition no-one could touch her."<p>"Ummm, Yeah." Michiru confirmed, trying to resist the urge to pound her head on the table.<p>"And Just How Do You Know Her?" Haruka spit each word out slowly, individually and with great precision.<p>Ranma winced at the icy fire in her loves voice. Maybe trying to have a child that was truly theirs had been a mistake. Maybe she should have left the dream as a dream and just gone with an unknown donor, maybe she should have let go of that dream. After all she loved Hotaru as her own, maybe the idea of an heir of her body was beyond reality. Still it was a dream she had entertained for quite some time now and she hated to let it go.<p>Ranma had hoped to avoid this problem, now she had to wonder just how she was going to deal with the situation without revealing that she was Ranma. She really didn't want to reveal that fact. She decided to stick with Plan A. Reveal if she must the time and relationship she had with Nodoka as Michiru. Unless Haruka found out about the Nanban mirror she shouldn't suspect the truth. So far as Haruka knew the only was to time-travel was via the Time Gates, and Haruka also knew that Pluto wouldn't let just anyone use them, certainly not someone like Saotome Ranma. Still Ranma gulped apprehensively, her biggest fears after falling in love with Haruka was that the other woman would leave her if she ever found out that she had been a "HE".<p>It was just that she so wanted the child to be both of theirs. What had originally been a contingency plan to deal with the Amazons had become a way for her to have a child with the woman she loved.<p>"I've known her since I was a child," Ranma answered softly, hoping against hope that this would satisfy Haruka.<p>"Since you were a kid? Did you know she was a swordswoman?" Haruka continued with the interrogation, her thoughts on a baby for the moment lost in the other issue.<p>"Yes I did."<p>"Did you ever see her practice her style?"<p>"Yes." Ranma answered softly, praying to whatever Kami would listen that Haruka wouldn't ask any more than that.<p>"Did you ever try it yourself." This time Haruka was confident that Michiru would answer in the negative, after all Michiru had never expressed an interest in the art of the sword and even her interest in Kempo seemed to be as a hobbyist at most..<p>Kami, why don't you ever answer my prayers? Ranma thought dejectedly. "Yes love I have."<p>"And."<p>"And what?"<p>"What was it like?"<p>"She's one of the best I've ever seen," Ranma answered truthfully.<p>"So how long did you train with her?" Haruka hung on to the issue with the tenacity of a bulldog.<p>"Haruka, Saotome Nodoka was my sensei for about five years. I stopped training under her about two years before our other duties came up, about two years before I met you," Ranma answered carefully. Every word she spoke was true, it just wasn't all of the truth.<p>"And you just gave it up? After five years of training with one of the best in Japan, " Haruka asked incredulously, "Why?"<p>Oh Kami, just let it go, once more Ranma prayed.<p>"No, after that time I trained with her sensei."<p>"You what?" to say that Haruka was stunned was to say that Pharaoh 90 was a bit evil, probably the understatement of the year . . . if not the decade.<p>"I trained with her sensei." Ranma repeated, once again mentally crying out for her love to stop asking these questions. She might as well have been praying for water to run uphill or for Usagi to stop crying when Rei teased her for all the luck she was having. Yes she had planned for this line of questioning and no she still did not expect her darkest secret to be uncovered, but she had hoped that this secret would stay hidden for at least a while longer, at least until she had figured out a way to reveal herself to Haruka. Ranma panicked as she wondered just how Haruka would react when she revealed her other martial skills, would it bring them together or would the fact that she was light years better than Uranus drive them apart?<p>"Why did she sent you to her sensei?"<p>Ranma could tell by the glazed look on Haruka's face that her tomboyish lover was overwhelmed by the entire notion, and more than a little shocked that Michiru was a student of her idol.<p>"Sensei Saotome said she had taught me all that she could, so she sent me to her Master to learn more."<p>It took a few moments for the senshi of Uranus to gather her wits about her as she stared incomprehensively at the woman she thought she knew so well.<p>"And you never told me this because . . .," Haruka growled.<p>"Sensei Saotome said that I was her only pupil outside. She told me that the only reason she trained me was because she considered me to be her daughter, if not by blood or law, by love. She also told me that she was not taking any more students until her son returned, and then she intended to teach only him. She said she had to get special permission to teach me as her Sensei's art was a family art, and I didn't want you to be disappointed." Ranma finished miserably.<p>Then she brightened as a thought came to mind. "Maybe if I tell her that you are my lover and that we have a child she'll teach you and our son or daughter when they are old enough."<p>Ranma could literally see Haruka light up at that thought, it was if a halogen floodlight had been ignited behind her lover's eyes. Then she saw the light dim a darker cloud pass over her loves face.<p>"Hey, wait a minute," the blond interjected thoughtfully, remembering a nugget of information, one gleaned from one of only a handful of interviews Saotome Nodoka had allowed. "Azami is supposed to be Saotome Nodoka's only student . . . ." she trailed off absently her thoughts lost for a moment as she considered what she had been told.<p>Ranma felt her heart rise up in her throat. Dammit she should have lied. No, Ranma quashed that thought as quickly as it arose. No she shouldn't have. There was a fine line between not telling Haruka about things her lover never asked about and lying to her face when she asked a direct question, but it was a line she did NOT intent to cross. Ranma could only hope that Haruka would see the line and understand that she had never crossed it . . . that she hoped with all her heart.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Haruka reeled from the revelations that her lover had heaped upon her tonight. It was like opening a child's book and instead of "See Spot Run" the book was a collection of Shakespeare. What at first seemed to be a simple question (if shocking and unlooked for) was now revealing secrets long held by her lover, secrets that revealed a whole new Michiru. First Michiru wanted a child, THEIR child. Then she had already picked the biological father out and it was the son of her idol Saotome Nodoka. To top it off Michiru now admitted to being a student of Saotome Nodoka. Haruka's brain was spinning with the strange news. Just how well did she know her lover? Never in a thousand years would she have expected these revelations.<p>Was this what Setsuna had been hinting about earlier today? Was there some reason other than the one given why Michiru had never told her about this even thought she knew how much she idolized Saotome Nodoka, and why had Pluto been so insistent that these secrets come to light now?<p>Hey! Wait just a minute. Haruka's brain paged her, trying to get her attention, and for a change Haruka was listening. Michiru was a student of Saotome Nodoka, Azami was a student of Saotome Nodoka, and according to all the information out in the press Saotome Nodoka the only student she had ever trained.<p>"You . . . You're Azami?" Haruka questioned incredulously. She didn't have to hear the answer to know the truth, the guilt, pain and (was that) fear? on her lovers face was enough to confirm the truth of the matter.<p>"Yes." Michiru answered softly. "My adoptive mother and father accepted the fact that I wanted to study the sword, but they forbid me from competing. They said it wasn't ladylike. I never told Sensei why I used an assumed name and she never asked. I think she knew, but as long as she wasn't certain she didn't object. It was the only way I could compete until I turned 18. By the time I turned 18 it was either keep the false identity or start over and make Azami disappear, even then it would be clear that we were using the same style and I didn't want any dishonor to go to Sensei Saotome because of my actions, so I was stuck with being Azami when I competed.<p>"Buy why did you hide it from me?" the hurt in Haruka's voice was as obvious as a battleship in a koi pond."<p>"I didn't want to. It hurts to hide things from you. But Sensei Saotome made me promise that I wouldn't teach her style to anyone other than my husband or child and that only if her sensei, Sensei Masaki also agreed. Maybe now I could ask her?"<p>Haruka could hear the earnestness in her lover's voice, but something still pulled at her thoughts, but not with enough force to come to the front of her mind.<p>"Do you forgive me Haruka?" Michiru pleaded.<p>Despite the turmoil that her thoughts were in Haruka had to fight back a smile. For once the shoe was on the other foot and Michiru sounded so pitiful, so lost and depressed at the thought of her displeasure. For once it wasn't her in trouble with Michiru, this time it was Michiru who was going to have to kiss and make up.<p>"Maybe." Haruka drawled, a catty look on her face. "Maybe you'll have to make it up to me tonight, and probably for several nights to come. After all this was a pretty big secret."<p>The look of relief on Michiru's face was priceless.<p>"Oh, I'm sure I can think of something," Michiru purred, obviously overjoyed to be even partially forgiven.<p>"Oh and Michiru. . . "Haruka continued.<p>"Yes love?"<p>"I'd love to have a baby with you. Just give me some time to adjust and . . . " Haruka was interrupted before she could finish when her aqua-haired lover darted around the table and with complete disregard for her normally reserved manner glomped onto her with a tenacity that even Tsukino Usagi couldn't match and kissed her with enough passion that set her blood on fire and turn her mind onto thoughts of a perverted nature.<p>It was several minutes before Michiru let her go, and even then the smaller woman didn't leave, but curled up on her lap with both arms around her waist and her head firmly planted in Haruka's chest.<p>"Michiru! We're in public."<p>"I don't care." Michiru pouted refusing to let go. "That was just the appetizer, just wait til I get you home." She whispered throatily into her lovers ear.<p>"Uhmm. Yeah," Haruka blushed as she saw the stares they were still getting from the closest tables. "I was going to finish by saying that we've got to check with Setsuna and Hotaru."<p>"I know love," Michiru grinned, "But I can be awfully convincing if I have a reason."<p>"That you can," Haruka agreed thinking back to some of their previous arguments, "But it may be a while before we can . . . ."<p>"I don't care if we have to wait. If we have to we will, but things have been pretty calm lately and . . .."<p>As if Michiru's words were a death knell to the peaceful evening their communicators went off. Their eyes met as they reached to activate their wrist communicators and Michiru reluctantly slide out of Haruka's comforting embrace, but not before giving Haruka one last passionate kiss.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Sailors Uranus and Neptune arrived at the Juban Trade Mall a few minutes later, their arrival heralded by the sounds of what was probably a gas main explosion accompanied by a large fireball that lit up the night sky.<p>"Over there." Uranus pointed, indicating the obvious.<p>Neptune nodded as the pair raced off moving at speeds a cheetah would envy and with all the grace the large predator would have shown as it hurtled toward it's prey. The sounds of combat grew ever more clear and daunting as they approached. It wasn't even a minute later when the courtyard turned battleground came into view.<p>It was a large spacious area that had been an island of relative peace within the sprawling city. The courtyard had bright multicolored ceramic tile flooring, oasis's of greenery dotted the landscape, with benches scattered near each tree and flowerbed. A concrete fountain complete with a statue of leaping koi had provided the calming sound of running water before the battle. Now it gushed freely with the water flooding the courtyard as water sprayed from what had once been a decorative statue. The short wall around the wishing pool was also broken in several separate locations, the water filled koi pond was rapidly draining, leaving the colorful fish to flop pitifully in the pool or on the courtyard tiles. Unfortunately the fish were not the only ones to lose their life. Uranus and Neptune saw more than one still body laying amidst the wreckage. They couldn't yet tell if the civilians were alive or dead, but the unnatural stillness of some did not bode well for their future. Even if some life remained it would not linger long unless the creatures causing the problem weren't stopped and stopped soon. Death was coming scythe in hand for some, of that there was no doubt.<p>Elsewhere in the courtyard they saw two large creatures that would have been more in some horrific Hollywood production than in the homely scene of the now deserted mall. Both were large and hideous in appearance, both sharing some features in common like a mouth full of sharp teeth and fearsome claws, but otherwise their appearances were markedly different.<p>Jupiter and Mars were squared off against the slightly larger of the two foes, both Scouts looked tired but very determined. Their enemy towered over them by at least four feet, though exactly how tall he stood was difficult to determine as he fought from a semi-crouched position. Even so he, (and a male it obviously was to judge from the phallus so clearly evident due to a total lack of clothing), stood at least nine foot and was more likely ten feet tall. His skin was slick and slimy as if he was coated in thick mucous. This disgusting possibility was definitely brought to mind as the ooze was a sickening puce color, and the creature looked like a boil about to erupt. Various bumps and nodules moved underneath the skin as if they weren't firmly in place. The thing had foot long claws on each hand and its feet were wickedly clawed as well, though they were only half as long. Its eyes were large, mismatched and full of hate as it stared at the two inner senshi. When it attacked it moved with a strange hopping gait that was as deceptively quick as it was ungainly. Jupiter barely avoided the things attack as it bounded toward her with gravity defying leaps.<p>The Outers watched as Jupiter's attempted Supreme Thunder missed, probably due to her forced evasions. Mar's Fire Soul was one of her quicker attacks, but it didn't appear to do much damage or to even slow the monster's rampage. The senshi were obviously tired and using some of their quicker firing attacks in an attempt to hit their fast moving target. Whatever it was, it wasn't holding still long enough for their attacks to score.<p>The other enemy was in the midst of an attack on Sailor Mercury. It was shorter, probably only eight foot or so in height, but where the first oozed like a slug, this one was scaled and literally glistened in the light of the burning buildings. It had small scales that were mottled in green and black, bone-like protrusions stuck out in random patterns all over the creatures body, but larger spikes were located at the elbows knuckles of each fist, and looked like they would as be viscous in hand to hand combat as the claws themselves. The sex of this creature was in doubt though it too was naked. The serpentine appearance and no external genitalia made it impossible to determine its gender, if any, while in the midst of combat, not that it really matter to either of the Outers. They were here to fight and fight they would. This one moved with sinister grace flowing toward Mercury with an almost hypnotic sway to its head and torso.<p>Uranus paused for a heartbeat evaluating their options. She felt almost free, as this was something she could handle. There was the enemy and she was going to take him down. There wasn't any of the complications like she had back at the restaurant, this was what she lived for, protecting the others and as clichéd as it sounded, saving the world.<p>Uranus took a deep breath in preparation a World Shaking coming on line as she looked over at her partner to coordinate the attack. Neptune's face was as composed and serene as always, yet this time Haruka saw and recognized for the first time the look in Neptune's eyes, Neptune looked hungry as she eyed the demonic presences.<p>"Lets fire at the one on Jupiter and Mars, then you go help them and I'll help Mercury," Neptune suggested calmly. "Oh and love, could I borrow your sword for a minute," she finished sweetly.<p>Haruka stared, shrugged, nodded and handed her lover the Space sword. She shouldn't need the blade with three of them ganging up on a single monster.<p>"You can't use its special attacks you know," Haruka offered conversationally.<p>"Yes love I know, but I shouldn't need it. The magical aura around the blade should let it cut the beast and that's all I'll need," Michiru responded calmly. "If it bleeds I can kill it."<p>Feeling more than a little confused, at the uncharacteristically bloodthirsty answer, but still confident in her lover's skills, Haruka nodded and handed her blade over. She had no doubt that Azami could wield the blade with all the necessary skill.<p>Uranus watched as Michiru deftly spun the blade in both a one and two- handed grip before nodding and bounding into the fray. Though the Space Sword was not the bokken or katana that she was used to, Neptune sure looked like she could handle the blade more than adequately.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma grinned inwardly, though her face showed no trace of the emotion, only her dancing cerulean eyes betrayed her eagerness to join the combat. Finally she could cut loose with more than a fraction of her true skill. Behind her she heard her lover call out her trademark "World Shaking" as Uranus joined in mortal combat.<p>Moving with a grace that would be envied by both dancers and martial artists, Neptune attacked from behind as the monster closed on Mercury. This demon had no honor to be protected and she had no desire to give it any warning before attacking. Ranma saw the senshi of ice and water backpedaling desperately in order to gain more room for her own attacks, but her main focus was on her foe. Neptune gave no thought to the other senshi as she trusted Uranus with her (and their) lives. Uranus had never failed her before and she had no reason to think tonight would be any different.<p>Landing behind her foe she opened the dance with a lightning quick slash to the back trying to sever the creatures spine. She didn't succeed in her efforts but still opened it up with a deep and gaping wound to its back, a cut which was followed by a spinning draw cut to the creature's right arm slicing nearly to the bone. Despite the armor provided by the things scaly hide, the Space Sword cut deeply with each swing. Ducking she avoided the rapid backhand that the demon countered with and moved slightly away falling into a deceptively loose stance.<p>"Neptune what...?" she heard Mercury call out to her, but ignored the younger woman all eyes on the snake-demon she now faced.<p>"I've got it Mercury." Ranma called out in a voice fit to freeze the very air around her. "Leave this one to me and go help the others."<p>Then the dance began again with another quick flurry of blow, counter-blow and parries as she and the demon concentrated on each other and the deadly waltz they were engaged in, both knew that only one would walk away.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Mizuno Ami, a/k/a Sailor Mercury watched in disbelief, her jaw dropping open as she watched Neptune engage the demon in melee combat. At first she thought Uranus had decided to help her, being to busy dodging to take a close look at just who was wielding the blade so skillfully. After she cleared the engagement area though she realized that the voice was all wrong, as were the colors of the fuku worn by her ally. It wasn't Uranus wielding the Space Sword, it was Neptune, who was wielding it quite well indeed.<p>What was going on? Mercury hesitated, surveying the situation from behind her Mercury Visor. It appeared that Neptune had things well under control and had the full attention of the demon. She watched as the aqua-tressed Sailor moved with fluid grace on both the attack and when she defended. Shrugging, she moved over to help the other senshi, but even as she arrived and launched a Shabon Spray Freezing the demon was hit by three other attacks as Uranus, Jupiter and Mars all connected, pulverizing the demon. The Demon literally exploded in a cloud of greasy black smoke and gobbets of tainted flesh.<p>She met the halfway as they turned toward the single remaining foe. Jupiter looked tired, as did Mars both streaked with sweat, soot and gore. The combat had been long by their standards and the enemy much more agile than their normal foes. The slimy creature had been quick enough to avoid most of their attacks, at least until it was hit by Uranus' World Shaking. Finally wounded it gone from being nearly impossible to hit, to slow moving target, and hit it they had until it was finally destroyed.<p>"What's up with Neptune?" she asked quietly as she pulled the Mercury computer out automatically analyzing the situation.<p>"I don't know." Jupiter answered looking toward Uranus.<p>"Yeah what's up with Neptune."? Rei interjected, "And why is she using the Space Sword?"<p>Uranus looked past the Inners as she watched her lover's battle.<p>"Damn," Uranus muttered under her breath, "She really is Azami."<p>The inner senshi looked even more puzzled by Haruka's absent-minded reply.<p>"Azami? Who the heck is that?" Rei asked harshly as she gasped for breath.<p>"Azami?" Jupiter questioned, "You don't mean the swords-woman who's won the last two all Japan Sword Tournaments. . . and if Neptune is Azami, where is Michiru? What the hell is going on?"<p>"It looks like Michiru though I suppose the disguise field could be standard for anyone transformed as Sailor Neptune, and the Silver Millennium energies are definitely those of Sailor Neptune," Mercury chimed in. "I'm not exactly sure what we are fighting either. The energy patterns don't match any know Negaverse entities."<p>"Watch." Haruka answered half-heartedly, though without any concern showing on her face, "Just watch."<p>The three Inners turned their attention, for the moment at least, away from Uranus or Mercury and back to the confrontation. They didn't have to watch long as the battle ended with a final flurry of rapid-fire slashes by the aqua-tressed senshi. When the second demon fell, it too disappeared in an dark flash of sickly looking smoke.<p>Before the four senshi could approach Neptune they heard the familiar voice of their leader Sailor Moon, echoed by an uncertain Sailor Venus.<p>"Why is Neptune using the Space Sword?"<p>The newly arrived senshi spoke from just behind the watching warriors of love and justice.<p>"Auuuggghhh. Sailor Moon don't do that," Mars complained clutching her chest. "I hate it when Pluto sneaks up on us and you DON'T need to start doing the same."<p>"I'm sorry," Moon wailed, "but I want to know what is going on."<p>This time four pairs of eyes turned toward the still stunned Sailor Uranus.<p>"Just what did you mean she's Azami?"<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * "Girls we've got to go," Setsuna called to the youngsters watching the television.<p>"What's up Setsuna-mama?" Hotaru asked tearing her eyes from the love scene in front of her. She and Chibi-Usa were right in the middle of watching Titanic, for an American movie it was pretty good and she didn't really want to miss anything.<p>"There's been a demon attack at one of the malls. We're going to be needed to help the victims. Both of you transform and lets go."<p>"Is everyone okay?" Chibi-usa asked even as she reached for her transformation pen.<p>"Yes Small Lady, the other senshi are fine. But some of the victims aren't going to last long enough to get to the hospital unless they get some healing and fast."<p>"Ok Pu," "Yes mama," The pair chorused their agreement.<p>Three light shows and a Pluto teleport later they arrived just in time to see Neptune finish off he demon.<p>"Pluto," Hotaru questioned softly, "Why is Michiru-mama using Papa's Space Sword?"<p>Saturn directed her question to Sailor Pluto, but kept her eyes on her friend, a friend who didn't appear shocked at what she saw. Hotaru reaffirmed her desire to get Chibi-usa back into her room and give her a grilling she'd remember all the way to Crystal Tokyo.<p>"That is Michiru-mama isn't it?" she continued.<p>"Yes love it is," Pluto answered with a nearly invisible smile. "It is indeed."<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * Ranma held her stance for a moment as the demon's dark aura dissipated, then relaxed. She turned to check on the other fight, and was unsurprised to see that it too was over.<p>To be honest she was somewhat disappointed that she wasn't going to be able to "work out" a bit more, but quickly quashed that thought when she observed the dazed expressions on her comrades' faces.<p>Ranma tried, and mostly succeeded in stifling the giggle that threatened to overcome her. She never giggled as Ranma, and still occasionally found it strange to do so now. Her second childhood and the skills gained as Michiru helped her contain herself and it was with a serene expression on her face that she glided over to her friends.<p>"You should really close your mouths you know," she began calmly, humor showing only in her eyes. "You'll catch flies if you don't."<p>"Very funny," Haruka intoned solemnly.<p>"Just who are you?" Rei interjected, "Are you Azami?" she finished softly, yet with fire in her voice.<p>"Why Uranus, you've been telling stories already I see," Ranma answered with a flirtatious look at her lover as she returned the Space Sword, a looked that she finalized by placing a deep scotching kiss on Uranus's lips. Turning toward the others she couldn't suppress one final smile, "Hi, I'm Sailor Neptune, sorry about this."<p>Ranma would've continued but she was interrupted by the arrival of Pluto, Saturn and Chibi-Moon.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"We'll talk later," Pluto interrupted, "But for now we need to see to the victims."<p>Chastened by Pluto's words the senshi quickly turned away from Neptune and began examining the bodies laying haphazardly around the courtyard. With the experience (unfortunately) gained from many prior battles they began the triage. Mercury, Jupiter and Mars quickly checked the injured, calling either Saturn or Moon over to those whose injuries were life threatening, and performing first aid on those less seriously hurt. Pluto, Neptune and Uranus gently laid out the bodies of those who were beyond any help, even the magical help of Moon and Saturn. Moving with sad reverence, they lined up those who had gone on to meet their ancestors, arranging them in a row that was much longer than they would've like to have seen.<p>The final tally was six dead, a dozen more needing prompt medical attention even after being healed by Saturn and/or Sailor Moon, and another half dozen with only superficial injuries. The wail of sirens growing rapidly closer gave evidence that welcome help was on its way. When the last casualty was loaded on the ambulances they left. There were more than enough witnesses to the events to fill the police in on what had occurred.<p>Usually, Sailor Moon appeared to have the last word. With a stern look at the Outer Senshi, Sailors Uranus and Neptune in particular she issued her orders in an uncharacteristically stern voice, once again showing a flash of the Queen that she will be and not the schoolgirl she was.<p>"The shrine, tomorrow, three o'clock after school, be there,"<p>"I can't." Michiru responded, "I've . . . ."<p>"That's alright Neptune," Pluto interjected as she gave a warning glance Sailor Moons direction. "Haruka can fill you in on what we discuss."<p>"But Pluto," several of the others interjected, "We want to know . . . ."<p>"I said it will be alright for her to take care of her business elsewhere. You've all missed a meeting or two and we should have time to talk on Sunday."<p>Sailor Moon studied Uranus, Neptune, Saturn, Pluto and Chibi-Usa for a few moments before responding. They were the ones most likely to know what was going on with Neptune. She might not be Queen Serenity yet, nor a mother, but she could see that Chibi-Usa was hiding something. She could also see the same closed expression on both Uranus and Saturn's faces as well. They too knew something. As usual Neptune and Pluto were inscrutable, their faces giving nothing away, at least nothing that the two enigmatic senshi didn't want to give away.<p>"If we must Pluto," Moon answered firmly, once again showing what wasn't yet but would be someday, "But I expect answers then, and answers I will have."<p>The cool smile on Pluto's face provided no comfort, but the expectant look in her normally unreadable eyes showed respect and perhaps the knowledge that she would have to answer to her future queen, at least in this instance.
