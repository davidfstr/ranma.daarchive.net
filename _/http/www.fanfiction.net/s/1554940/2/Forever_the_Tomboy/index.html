</div>See Chapter 1 for disclaimer<p>A/N – Ranma and Michiru will be used somewhat interchangeably when describing Ranma's actions though I will tend to use Ranma more often. When she is thinking about herself Ranma or Ranma-chan will be used. Obviously others will use the name they are familiar with when talking to her.<p>Forever the Tomboy – Ch –2 -Meeting Old Friends<p>Breakfast was often a quiet affair for this household. Haruka and Setsuna could only be described as being cheerful morning people by a person addicted to sarcasm. Indeed until they had their second (and sometimes third) cup of coffee Ranma wasn't sure she'd even call them human. This morning, as was the norm, the only sounds were those of eating with an occasional swish of the morning paper's pages being turned. Conversation was virtually non-existent beyond the usual morning greetings until the morning meal was over.<p>"Michiru-mama, will you walk me to school today?" Hotaru asked softly, Though the youngster tried to sound casual, something in her voice told Ranma that her daughter was either stressed out, nervous or both.<p>Of course the way that Hotaru was pushing the food around her plate instead of eating it was a not so subtle clue as well. Instincts well honed by trials of "motherhood" were sending little signals to Ranma's brain. Hotaru was clearly upset or unsure about something. Ranma hid a sigh, once again glad that as Michiru she had finally developed, "the mask." That was what she called the serene expression she normally wore. One that kept her fears and doubts hid from the world at large. The "open book" her face had been when Ranma was gone, and now she showed none of the worry or concern that Hotaru's tone brought to her. Instead Ranma had a serene almost elegant calm expression that hid well her thoughts.<p>"Of course, Hotaru-chan." Ranma answered, with a look of concern flashing quickly in her eyes if not across her face. "I would love to walk with you."<p>"I can drive." Haruka offered bluntly, the blond tomboy clearly missing the signals that Hotaru was sending out. "That way you won't be tired when you get there."<p>Laughing to herself though her expression didn't give away her inner feelings. Baka tomboy, she thought to herself, though even she could hear the affection her inner voice felt as she used the loving insult. However, even as she laughed to herself about Haruka's obtuseness, Ranma noticed the look that flitted across her daughters face. Whatever was bothering the youngest senshi was something that Hotaru wasn't ready to talk about in front of her papa, or Setsuna.<p>As if conjured by the mere thinking of her name Setsuna lowered the newspaper shielding her from the rest of the family. "Is everything alright?"<p>"Yes Setsuna-mama." Hotaru answered desperately striving to look nonchalant and to the eyes of Setsuna and Ranma failing miserably, though Haruka seemed to be fooled . . . at least for the moment.<p>"Are you sure?" Setsuna questioned. Though she spoke to Hotaru, the green- haired senshi's eyes were focused on the senshi of Neptune. A fact that Ranma was only to aware of.<p>"If you need to talk about something we're all willing to listen." With a barely perceptible pause, Pluto's eyes narrowed. "After all there is a time for secrets and a time for secrets to be shared."<p>A barely controlled snort of laughter interrupted as Haruka wagged her finger at Pluto. "A 'time' to spill secrets Setsuna. Is it time for you to share some of yours, or is this a case of the pot calling the kettle black?"<p>"You know I say what I can when the time is right." Setsuna answered, almost reflexively defensive in he response.<p>The oldest of the senshi leaned back in her chair, talking a long drink of coffee before she continued. "However, secrets held to long can spoil more than just the secret."<p>"Cryptic as ever Setsuna." Ranma broke in calmly. "But I still need to answer Hotaru and Haruka.."<p>"I don't think a ride will be necessary, the walk will do us both good." Ranma answered turning back to her daughter as she spoke. Sure enough she could see the relief in her daughters lustrous purple eyes.<p>"But you are going to be gone all weekend and I thought we could . . . " Haruka spluttered.<p>"I'll meet you at school," Ranma smiled softly, "and I'm not leaving until the morning, so you can take me out to dinner tonight."<p>"Dinner." The blond tomboy spluttered still more as she felt control of the conversation slipping even further from her grasp.<p>"Of course, dinner some dancing and then, perhaps we can find something else to do to entertain ourselves. Chibi-Usa is spending the night and you know that after they've worn themselves out they'll sleep like the dead so we won't bother them, and Setsuna said she wouldn't be back until late." This time the smile on Ranma's face was more than bit wider, and a lot less innocent than her earlier expression.<p>"Mama!" this time is was Hotaru sputtering in embarrassment<p>Haruka only sighed. It seemed she never won these of arguments. She might be able to sway her lover when Michiru didn't already have a firm position to defend. However, when her aquamarine haired lover dug her heels in with that certain stubborn look in her deep blue eyes she was sunk. Michiru always seemed to have the knack of derailing her arguments.<p>"Speaking of secrets, you never have said what your plans are or where you are going this weekend." Haruka tried desperately to change the topic, perhaps a distraction would work.<p>Ranma smiled quietly, "No-where important. Just to visit some old friends."<p>"Not old girlfriends I hope." Haruka teased, "Or if they are then you need to invite me."<p>"No, At least not this time, although." Michiru answered wickedly. "This time I'm just going to see a couple of my old sensei. I don't think you'd like them that well." Ranma knew this was the understatement of the century, though not for the reason that Haruka thought. Her "sensei's would be lucky to survive Haruka if they acted normally around her.<p>"Oh, Well okay, I'll see you at school." Haruka nodded her agreement as she rose, breakfast finished. While she loved hearing Michiru play her violin, the tomboy had no desire to sit around and listen to Michiru talk music with her old sensei for hours.<p>Ranma smiled, enjoying the view as Haruka bent to pick up her school bag. Even in the boys uniform Haruka insisted on wearing in her eyes Haruka was beautiful. The smile widened as she considered Haruka's words. What she had told Haruka was the truth completely, unalterably 100% true. However, it was also 100% misleading.<p>"Oh, and Haruka,"<p>"Yes Michiru."<p>"I've got your tuxedo back from the cleaners. We're going to Chizuma's tonight."<p>Haruka gulped, paling noticeably, "Chizuma's, we'll never get in on such short notice."<p>Ranma's laugher was like chiming bells, "I've had the reservations for weeks. I knew you'd pout if we didn't do something special before I left this weekend." She continued teasingly<p>Ranma's laughter continued as her love glared at her for a few moments before finally giving up and grinning back.<p>Ranma's smile broadened as once again she considered the changes she had wrought in her new life. Things had worked out even better than she'd imagined when she took the first steps down this road so many years ago. She had learned so much, and her grasp on life was much tighter than it had ever been before, though even this new life had not been without major trials of its own, he r life as Sailor Neptune being just one example.<p>"Mama," Hotaru interrupted, a bit of wonder and awe tingeing her words, "How do you get Haruka-papa to go along with you so much."<p>"I'm the best, . . . " Ranma answered with mischief dancing in her eyes, ". . . at a lot of things."<p>Hotaru sighed, "I wish . . "she trailed off.<p>Her face growing serious, Ranma pulled her daughter into a hug. "What is it honey."<p>"Momma." Hotaru protested softly.<p>"I know, you aren't a child anymore, but you'll always be my little girl to me."<p>Letting go Ranma, with Hotaru's help quickly cleared the table and only moments later they were walking to school.<p>Looking down at her daughter Ranma waited. She knew that Hotaru had something on her mind, but she also knew that the child had to be ready to speak, and that whatever concerned Hotaru was weighing on her mind. She remembered only to well what it was like to have others try forcing your life into their pattern.<p>The walked in silence for two, nearly three blocks before Hotaru spoke. Though it was a beautiful spring day, neither really noticed as their minds were occupied on other things.<p>"Michiru-mama."<p>"Yes Hotaru."<p>"Do you, do you think anyone will ever love me."<p>Though the words were spoken softly, Ranma could hear the pain in her daughter's voice.<p>"You know that Haruka and I love you, so do Setsuna, Chibi-Usa, Ami, Rei, Makoto, Minako, Usagi, Mamoru . . . we all love you."<p>"You guys have to . . ." Hotaru voice shook as she began.<p>"No, no we don't have to." Ranma interrupted. "When Haruka and I first..." Ranma paused looking for the right word, ". . . started we barely got along with any of the others yet things got done. Maybe not as well as they do now, but they still got done. We love you because you are who you ARE, not because of what you can do."<p>"That's just it. The kids at school hate me. Everyone say's I'm a freak . . . a monster just because I can heal people. They're either afraid of me, ignore me or pick on me." The last part came out as a near wail, anguish pouring from Hotaru. "And they're right, I am some kind of freak of nature."<p>"Stop that right now." Ranma's voice was almost cold as it cut through the self-pity.<p>"But, but I am." The wail continued. "'Normal' people can't do things like that."<p>Dropping her voice Hotaru continued after looking around to make sure that no-one else was close by, ."I can't even blame Senshi magic for this. I can heal whether I'm Saturn or not."<p>Ranma stopped, pulling the younger Senshi to her in a fierce hug. "Do NOT call yourself a freak. You have a gift that should be cherished, and certainly don't worry about being normal . . . I don't ."<p>"But . . . "<p>"Listen to me." Ranma broke through the beginnings of another wail," Hugging Hotaru close for a moment then gently pushing her to arms length, but NOT letting go she marched the younger girl over to a store-front to be out of the main flow of traffic.<p>"What do you see?" Ranma pointed to Hotaru's reflection.<p>"M me." Hotaru replied softly.<p>"Let me tell you what I see. I see a young woman, a beautiful young woman." Stroking Hotaru's hair, Ranma continued softly. "Look closely. You ARE beautiful, and you will be even more so in a couple of years. Everything about you is pretty. You've got beautiful hair, and your eyes . . . "<p>"They're weird to." Hotaru protested. "They're purple."<p>"Yes they are, and a wonderful color too. You know when you smile they nearly glow. So what if they aren't normal. Pausing a moment to consider her words, she smiled softly. Before her new life Ranma knew that she'd be worse than helpless in this situation. Heck she'd probably have made it worse with her old foot-in-mouth problem. "Now look at me."<p>Once again Ranma gestured to the window. "Now look at me and tell me what you see."<p>Sighing, Hotaru ignored the people walking near them and considered her mama's reflection.<p>"I see you mama," she responded uncertainly.<p>"And when you see me, what do you see?" Ranma questioned softly. "Just how normal do I look?"<p>Tugging at a lock of her own aquamarine hair Ranma twirled it around her finger as she waited for an answer.<p>"Well . . . " Hotaru hesitated. "You are really pretty momma." She hedged, blushing softly.<p>"Thank you Hotaru, but you still haven't answered my question." Ranma prodded gently.<p>"Well, your hair is kind of unusual . . . but that's different."<p>"Why?"<p>"Well, you dye your hair momma. You picked the color yourself."<p>Laughing softly Ranma replied. "Maybe so, but is it normal."<p>"Well, no." Hotaru admitted. "But you could change it if you wanted to."<p>"Yes I could. But do you know what my color my hair really is."<p>"No mama I don't."<p>"Red, it's red, bright coppery red. Now is that "normal" either? Are there any other girls in your school with natural red hair?"<p>"No mama, but that's still different, red is a normal color for hair. Healing people isn't and I didn't choose to be able to heal people. That's just something I can do."<p>"Maybe so." Ranma admitted. "What about my eyes, just how normal are blue eyes for a Japanese girl."<p>"Not very." Hotaru, "But that's still different. Unusual maybe but still that's not the same. People aren't afraid of you because of them." Blushing brighter, she added softly. "Haruka-papa says they're exotic."<p>"Yes dear, and so are your purple eyes. I love the color of your eyes, and one of these days so will someone else."<p>"Maybe," Hotaru conceded grudgingly, "But that doesn't change my healing ability." Once again the young girl sniffled softly, "And no-one wants to get to know me. I'm just a freak to them."<p>Ranma tightened her grip, gently but ever so firmly holding her daughter.<p>"Hotaru dear. You are not a freak." Thinking hard Ranma knew that she needed something more to convince her daughter of the truth of her words and to show just how idiotic Hotaru's schoolmates were.<p>"When you heal someone how does that make you feel?"<p>"Well, it makes me feel good. But that's when I'm Saturn. Everyone knows that the senshi have powers and no-one cares about my ability to heal. They just think it's magic or something."<p>"Maybe so. But you can still help people and you do. That hardly makes you someone to fear."<p>"But they DO!" This time the anguish was back. "They do and they hate me."<p>"Oh Hotaru." Once again Ranma drew the younger girl into a hug. "I see it's you need to be convinced that being different isn't necessarily a bad thing. Though it often feels like it."<p>Pulling her sailor communicator, Ranma contacted her lover and spoke softly after hearing Haruka's acknowledgment."<p>"Love, I'm not going to make it to school today. Hotaru and I need to do something else today."<p>"No, everything is alright." Ranma responded. "I'm going to take her to meet some friends of mine . . . no you don't know them either . . . yes we will be okay, I just think she needs a day off." With an impish grin Ranma answered the blonde's next inquiry. "No, this doesn't get you out of dinner tonight. We should be back around the time you get home."<p>"Mama." Hotaru questioned. "Who are we going to see."<p>"Some old friends of mine." Ranma evaded the question with a smile. "I think you'll like them."<p>With no further explanation Ranma turned and headed away from the school and toward their home. She did remember to take the time to call the schools, hers and Hotaru's to let them know that they wouldn't be attending today."<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>A short while later, after a quick walk home, a change of clothes, and a few more phone calls to check on her old friends, the mother and daughter pair were on their way. It wouldn't be long before she would again see some of her "old friends". Friends she hadn't been able to see in two years.<p>She just hoped that the other "old friends" were in school like they were supposed to be, otherwise this trip might be more informative for Hotaru than Ranma wanted it to be. She was still uncertain that this was the best plan, but Ranma knew that the old hands in Nerima wouldn't bat an eye at Hotaru's abilities, and she knew just who see first. Not only would they not be afraid they would undoubtedly encourage Hotaru to continue using these gifts. A closer look at some of the less "normal" people might show Hotaru that she wasn't alone in being a little out of the ordinary.<p>It was nice that the ones that could probably help the most were also the ones she most wanted to see as well. Ranma had planned on visiting them this weekend as they were part of her planned activities, the ones she wouldn't tell Setsuna or Haruka about. Plans that would finally allow her to take some of her life as Ranma back and allow her to openly practice the Art that had been her life for so long. While the Art was no longer everything, it was still a BIG thing and one that she really didn't want to have to hide anymore. She had continued to train and with the extra years now under her belt she was even better than when she faced Saffron. Training trips were harder to hide, and her identity as a top ranked competitor grew ever harder to conceal as word of a young woman with extraordinary skills was around, and one with no known school affiliation.<p>Her art was still a big, (though mostly concealed) part of her life and one that would be very valuable to her scout activities. A frown marred her features momentarily as several thoughts cascaded through her mind. That had been an unexpected condition Happosai had required before his help was given. She had to swear not to publicly use Anything Goes until she had beaten the old letch. Of course the up side was that she had trained even harder with other sensei's and learning their styles then incorporating them into her version of Anything Goes. A couple of them could undoubtedly wipe the floor with Happosai, that old priest Masaki being one of them. He had taught her both armed and unarmed forms, and quite frankly had literally beaten the idea that a weapon user was automatically weak out of her. If not properly trained in both armed and unarmed styles this was true, but against a master, such as the keeper of the Masaki Shrine, it most definitely was not true. It was only last year that she had satisfied Sensei Masaki enough to "graduate" so to speak.<p>The match with Happosai was set for this weekend and she was so looking forward to it. Ranma just hoped the old geezer had kept his part of the bargain and kept Nabiki in the dark. If she knew then this weekend was going to be much more interesting that she hoped. While her relations with Nabiki had improved drastically the last few months before her disappearance, she didn't know how much the "Ice Queen" knew. She had told Kasumi to use her own best judgment there.<p>"Nerima?" Hotaru exclaimed, "Why are we going there? Who do you know there.?" With a more diffident tone she Hotaru continued. "Is Nerima as wild as they say it is?"<p>"Yes it is." Ranma answered with a smile as the train glided along the tracks. "Don't worry dear everything will be fine," with a grimmer tone she finished. "I'll make sure of that."<p>The ride from Juban to Nerima wasn't all that long and soon Hotaru found herself in fabled Nerima. The reputed home of martial arts masters capable of astounding feats. That is if Makoto could be believed. Jupiter considered herself a martial arts buff, as did Haruka, and while both were extremely doubtful that the "masters" found in Nerima could do the things that were reported, they didn't rule it out. After all there were the Sailor Senshi, and once you believed in magical girls fighting for truth and love how could you dismiss the possibility that other strangeness existed. Both did however figure that the tales were exaggerated. After all how could normal humans without magical abilities at all do the things that urban legend suggested. Ki blasts belonged in movies not real life, at least not for "normal" people.<p>Hotaru's eyes grew to the size of saucers as she followed her mama. Michiru seemed to know exactly where she was going as she moved purposefully toward some yet as unnamed goal.<p>Everywhere the girl looked she saw signs of damage and repair. It reminded her of Juban and the areas after a fight with the Negaverse. While most places were neat and tidy, signs of fights were plentiful. Patches adorned the road and buildings, well done, but still obviously not part of the original construction.<p>"Yes Hotaru, most of those repairs are to fix damages caused by martial arts duels." Ranma answered the unasked question.<p>Hotaru noticed that the further along they went the more damage and/or damage repairs they saw. It was almost as if they were walking toward the epicenter of a blast.<p>Finally, Ranma stopped at a small gate set in a wooden wall. The sign identifying the place was weathered and obviously not new, but it still served it's purpose and told all and sundry that this dojo was the home of the Tendo School of Anything Goes Martial Arts.<p>A feeling of nostalgia swept through Ranma as he entered the gate. This place with all its memories, both good and bad, had been his home for over a year, before her chosen transformation. It had been his first real home after the ten year "training trip" that Genma had taken him on. Ranma no longer thought of Mr. Saotome as his father , now if she were feeling charitable it was Genma, most of the time she had other words to describe her biological father, words that she tried not to use in front of Hotaru. In her mind and heart, where it really counted, it had been years since she even thought of considering the panda as her father.<p>Subtly extending her ki, Ranma confirmed that no-one had come home in the short time between her initial call to Kasumi and now, though she was puzzled as she didn't sense Kasumi's presence in the home either.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Hotaru watched her mama with some puzzlement. Michiru looked like she knew this place well, but to the best of her knowledge she had never been to Nerima before. Yet Michiru had come straight here, not even pausing to check the street signs or ask for directions.<p>The young girl watched as Michiru took a deep breath, then knocked on the door of the home they were about to enter. Hotaru knew that something was going on, and whatever it was had her mama feeling nervous, and wasn't normal. Her mama was one of the most collected people she knew. Indeed Kaiou Michiru was the very personification of the entry line she used as a senshi . . . elegant. Whomever lived here seemed to break though the reserve that her mama normally showed the world, and that did make her nervous.<p>For the first few moments after Michiru knocked neither heard anything except the normal sounds of the district. Traffic, voices from strollers outside the walk, birds, nothing but the usual. Then Hotaru heard the gate open and close and light quick footsteps approaching from behind them. Turning she saw a girl about the same age as her mama wearing blue dress. Long brown hair was pulled into a ponytail, all in all a very fetching sight if one were so inclined. However, what drew the eye more than the girl's good looks was her smile, so warm and kind, a smile that not only reached the eyes, but one that made her soft gray eyes glow with warmth. She held a small bag of groceries in her arms, explaining without words why the woman wasn't home when the arrived even though her mama had called before thy came.<p>The woman stopped short, a look of wonder crossing her face making an already cute face even more beautiful than before. Hotaru was nearly stunned by the girl's reaction to their presence, the groceries were hastily put down as the brunette barely stopped long enough to set the shopping bag down, then rushed them flinging herself into her mama's arms with a cry of joy.<p>Eyes bulging, Hotaru watched as her mama was fiercely hugged by someone who was not Haruka-papa Not only that but her mama was hugging back just as heartily, tears making glistening tracks down Michiru's normally calm face.<p>"I've missed you so much the last few months." Hotaru heard the brunette say.<p>The sob of relief clearly evident in her soft voice. "Even though you told me Ran . . . ."<p>The brunette's words were interrupted, and Hotaru's eyes would've grown even wider had they the ability to do so as she watched her mama give the woman a soft kiss on the cheek.<p>"Now Kasumi, you knew that I had to leave."<p>Her mother's voice was soft and warm as she spoke to this stranger. Yet what troubled Hotaru was that it was just as caring as when mama spoke to her . . . ... or to Haruka-papa . . . and it was a voice she seldom used for anyone else. Just who was this Kasumi . . . and why were they here.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Tendo Kasumi hurried home from the grocery with a smile gracing her lips. Not the smile that was her usual expression, a smile so vacuous that it simply served as a mask to cover her inner feelings. No this smile was as real as it was wide going from ear to ear. Ranma was coming to visit. Oh how she had missed her these last three months.<p>Ranma, no MICHIRU's call had been quite unexpected. The call itself was a shock, as they'd been so careful to limit themselves to mail and e-mail for so long. Then to top it off she was bringing her adopted daughter along. That was a surprise. Ran . . . Michiru had told her in her last e-mail that she was coming tomorrow. The plan was for her to show up on Sunday do what she came to do, and then if all went well perhaps she and Kasumi would have some time to spend together. She had so missed her friend, or was that friends.<p>The smile grew as Kasumi considered the weirdness that consumed Ranma's life. What Ranma . . . . No that was Michiru . . . . What Michiru considered as normal and tolerable chaos would drive most people to the brink of insanity and probably beyond.<p>Kasumi had begun preparing some tea and cookies only to discover that her sister, "The Kitchen Destroyer" had apparently used all the cinnamon and nutmeg during her last attempt at cooking. What was strange about that was that Akane had been trying to stir fry meat. Kasumi's smile darkened a bit as she considered her youngest sister. Though Kasumi would never use the nickname Shampoo had given Akane out loud, even she had to admit how appropriate the name actually was.<p>That said, Kasumi had immediately left to buy some cookies to go with the tea. She planned to serve. Unfortunately there had been several people in front of her at the store and she was running late, and she wanted to see Ranma oh so much.<p>Ranma had been a dear friend to her for so many years. Kasumi still remembered the first time she had met Kaiou Michiru. Michiru had been at the park and simply walked up and introduced herself. They had immediately become friends. Kasumi remembered how it had almost seemed at times as if Michiru had known her for years. Just two years ago she had found out just how right that feeling had been. Shortly before Ranma and the panda arrived Michiru had met with her one last time. During that conversation Kasumi had been told some things she wasn't willing to accept. It had hurt her and hurt her badly to hear Michiru's crazy talk of fiancés, super- powered martial artists, old perverts and amazons. Kasumi had been so sure that her friend had either lost her marbles or was playing some awful trick on her, and that hurt. They had been friends for so long that either possibility hurt.<p>The truth became evident a couple of weeks later when just as Michiru predicted a panda and a redheaded girl showed up at their home. The truth, as unbelievable as the truth had been, meant that she had been right all along. The reason it had felt like she and Michiru had been friends for years when they first met . . . was because they had been. True Ranma had been uncouth and crude . . . socially inept was a nice way to put it, Baka and jerk were other words used. However, even from the beginning Kasumi had seen flashes of the "true" Ranma, the one that placed honor above all else, who would rather be hurt himself that risk his friends<p>That had been their last meeting until today. Ranma had said it was too risky for them to meet anywhere in Nerima. With the chaos in his/her life they would've been found out eventually. If nothing else Happosai and Elder Cologne could sense her presence if she were forced to use her ki for some reason. Ranma didn't want that until she was ready to deal with her problems in her own way.<p>Kasumi's smile flickered, as a frown momentarily washed across her face. It had been so hard to keep quiet as she watched the others take advantage of her friend, to abuse her trust . . . and his/her body as well. If it hadn't been Michiru's insistence that things had to play out as they once had Kasumi knew she would have put a stop to the shenanigans of her younger siblings<p>The hardest had been watching Akane, the sister she loved so, much treat Ranma so hatefully. Kasumi knew that Akane didn't have it easy at school. The way that Kuno and the other boys treated her was shameful, but Akane's reaction was extreme. Instead of disliking those pestering her, Akane's anger had transformed into a general dislike of boys in general. Her sister wasn't a lesbian, she like men well enough but that brought it's own brand of trouble. Akane was not interested in any boy near her own age and the ones she might be interested in were to old for her . . . at least for right now. In a few years a gap of five or even ten years would be negligible, but with Akane still seventeen (though she would be eighteen in a couple more months) that wasn't the case now. Despite all that happened, despite Ranma's disappearance, Akane still blamed her problems on him.<p>Nabiki had been just as bad in her own way, at least until after the failed wedding attempt. After that Nabiki had done her best to make amends with Ranma and to a surprising degree had succeeded. The middle sister had cancelled all of Ranma's "debts" and had begun asking his/her permission to take pictures and the blackmailing had stopped. If she hadn't already known that was going to happen it would have been a shock. .<p>The saddest part was that she had seen the change in Nabiki and flashes of regret that she had tossed aside Ranma. The more the mercenary Tendo had seen of Ranma the more she grew to respect him and the harder it became to exploit him. Though to be truthful that hadn't sunk in for the middle daughter of Soun until after the Saffron incident and the failed wedding, and by then it was to late to be more than friends with Ranma . . . at least without more time that she had available to her. Ranma was truly fond of Nabiki, but in an older sister type of way, and while Kasumi didn't doubt Nabiki's power of persuasion, nor her ability to get what she wanted there simply hadn't been enough time for her to move beyond the "sisterly" image Ranma had of her. Things came to a head so quickly . . . .<p>A giggle escaped as she recalled time after time when the others were panicking and she had remained calm. She knew the others sometimes considered her to be oblivious to everything around her, with a calm that was nearly supernatural. The fact of the matter was even more amazing. She had been able to stay calm because her friend Michiru had let her know when something big was coming up as well as the outcome. She had known ahead of time about the skating match, about the Amazons, about Ryouga, and all the other incidents that so worried everyone else. She knew they were coming and knew that everything would come out all right . . . . The smile faltered again as Kasumi considered her thoughts. No, that wasn't exactly right. NEARLY everything came out alright, but to her, no matter that Michiru seemed happy, it was not right how Ranma was treated and how it drove him to seek a solution to his problem that would deal with all the issues of honor that he knew of, and that would allow the others to pick up their lives and continue on.<p>Kasumi looked up in surprise at the gate to their yard. She had been so lost in thought that the trip back had seemed to take only moments. Opening the gate Kasumi saw a pair of young women standing before the door.  The taller one reaching up to knock before they both turned toward her.<p>The oldest Tendo daughter wasn't sure if she dropped the groceries or set them down, and to tell the truth she didn't care either way. Forgetting her usual decorum she flung herself at Ranma glomping him as professionally as Shampoo had ever done. Tears flowed as she squeezed her friend for all she was worth.<p>She found herself crying even as she spoke. "I've missed you so much the last few months. Even though you told me Ran . . . ."<p>Ranma/Michiru interrupted her with a soft kiss on the cheek.<p>"Now Kasumi, you knew that I had to leave." Came the soft gentle she had so longed to hear, the voice of a friend who had always been there to listen and to talk to, the voice of her best friend.<p>Finally, and with more than a little regret, Kasumi released the glomp and held Michiru out at arms length as if to inspect her.<p>Michiru had grown some and filled out more than a little, but she was still short, much shorter than Kasumi herself. She was dressed in a green silk blouse, dark blue pants and flat healed boots that she could run or fight in, though they were of high quality and looks. Her hair was the same aquamarine color that, though unusual, looked so good on her and brought out the depths of her sapphire eyes. Kasumi detected the hint of make-up skillfully applied and the outline of a lacy bra under the thin shirt. Yes this was definitely Michiru and NOT Ranma.<p>Her daughter was comfortably attired in a lavender shirt with a darker purple skirt. Her clothes too accented her eyes, though those orbs were an unusual purple color. Dark hair framed a delicate face that right now was dark and sad. A face that was beautiful, but which didn't shine with the joy that a pretty girl her age should have.<p>"Kasumi, this is my daughter Tomoe Hotaru, Hotaru this is my friend Tendo Kasumi."<p>"Pleased to meet you Hotaru." Kasumi replied. "I've seen pictures of course, but they failed to do you justice. "<p>Kasumi had to stifle a giggle, it appeared the warmth of her greeting to Michiru had somewhat stunned the younger girl. Not surprising she guessed.  Kasumi knew that Ranma/Michiru still liked girls and supposed that Hotaru could have gotten the wrong impression from their greeting.<p>Belatedly returning formal Kasumi bowed to her guests. "Please come inside, we can have some tea and talk. I understand you want me to help you with a problem."
