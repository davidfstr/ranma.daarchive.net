</div>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer<p>A reviewer made a good point on the Tenchi continuity. For those that want to know (or care) this is (basically) the OAV setting – just tweaked a bit.  I happen to like Kiyone so even though she comes from the Tenchi Universe setting (and a couple of the movies) I knew I was going to have her in the fic. So in hopes of preventing "name" confusion I used Achika for Tenchi's mother's name as it was given in at least one of the non-OAV settings as her name.<p>Forever the Tomboy Ch. 9 -<p>How Far Will She Go For the Art<p>Ranma and Nodoka were startled at the look of shock on the faces of their hosts. Sensei Masaki, Tenchi, Ayeka and the others all shared a look of amazed disbelief.<p>"Did you say Funaho?" Ayeka stuttered, her words echoed by Tenchi and Ryoko.<p>"Yes I did," Nodoka answered, a questioning look plastered across her face.  "Why? Have you heard of these legends?"<p>"No . . ." Tenchi stuttered, "That's the name of my great-grandmother, I was just surprised by the coincidence."<p>Ranma smirked cutely at her friend's reply, and she thought she'd been a bad liar when she was still a boy. It was clear that Ten-chan knew something more than he was saying . . . but it was equally obvious that he wasn't ready just yet to say what he knew. Ayeka's face on the other hand was much harder to read. Her expression returned to its prior mask. Her face gave nothing away, it showed little of her inner thoughts. Indeed she looked like a politician who had just been asked if she was going to raise taxes, polite and more than a little disbelieving that the question had even been asked.<p>Ranma glanced over at her mama and saw her own thoughts reflected in her mother's eyes, though her face too was closed and gave away little. The older woman was clearly not convinced that Tenchi was being completely honest with his reply. She loved him like the nephew she considered him to be, and knew him quite well. Ranma knew that Nodoka had visited a lot when Achika was still alive, and continued that trend for years afterwards. It wasn't until Ranma had returned and she had so desperately been seeking her son that she stayed in Tokyo and didn't leave, not even to continue her twice yearly visits to her Sensei, his grandson and the Masaki shrine.<p>Ranma didn't doubt that Ten-chan's statement was true. She was also certain however, that it was far less than the whole truth. Seeing that she would get no where with the purple haired girl, she turned her gaze toward the other girl hanging off of Ten-chan. Trying to read the amber eyed Ryoko was another matter. Her feelings were much more open and more easily read. She too knew something about what Tenchi and Ayeka were thinking, that much was clear. The question was whether she could be convinced to tell them what the others weren't ready to divulge yet.<p>"Perhaps," Ranma thought, "It might be easier to get her to talk than to pry the knowledge from the other two.<p>Shooting a penetrating look at her sensei she tried to get past the impassive front that Katsuhito was projecting. As she had expected her attempt was doomed to fail. In the short time it took for Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko to speak he had already recovered from any surprise inspired by Nodoka's comment and his face was as hard to read as an instruction manual written in a foreign language. Katsuhito's gaze met hers levelly, giving away nothing other than a passing interest in what was being said.<p>The others around the table varied in their responses and their expressions. Sasami had a mysterious smile that somehow seemed out of place on a face as innocent and young as hers. It was as if she too knew more than she was willing to tell.<p>Washu on the other hand had a manic gleam in her eye and a wild smile on her lips. Washu's hands were twitching as if they needed to be busy at some job, as if the young redhead desperately wanted to be doing something with them. What it was she wanted to do Ranma didn't know, but it was clear that she was very interested in the conversation, and that her interest was more than just a passing curiosity.<p>Kiyone was simply watching everyone else, her eyes locked on to whomever was speaking, and the professional mask of a social worker or cop was firmly in place. Ranma knew that look only to well having seen it many times on the faces of the orphanage workers . . . and on the faces of the police he and the panda had encountered all to often.<p>The blond woman Mihoshi was much more open and her face was as easy to read as a book, a manga at that. Her expressive blue eyes were shining with excitement and she was beginning to literally vibrate with excitement as she sat.<p>"That's so cool," Mihoshi gushed. "Hey Tenchi. She's related to your great grandmother. Won't Funaho be surprised when she finds out." Although phrased as a question, it was clear from her tone that the blond was making a statement of fact.<p>"We need to call her and let her know. I'll run out to the Yagami and put a call through right now."<p>"Mihoshi-san, my great grandmother . . . " Nodoka paused, obviously not wanting to put a damper on Mihoshi's excitement, but also knowing that her ancestor had been dead for hundred of years.<p>"This happened nearly a thousand years ago," Nodoka spoke carefully. "I don't think we will be able to tell her anything."<p>Ranma smirked, the expression could be construed as one of arrogance, but somehow despite that, it just made her look even cuter. "The way my life has been," Ranma thought, "I wouldn't be surprised if great grandma had married an Oni Prince and was still alive. But even so, why would the Masaki's know of her?"<p>"That's right Mihoshi," Tenchi stammered, "There is no way they could be the same person, right grandfather?"<p>Ranma wasn't convinced. Tenchi had his right arm behind his head scratching the base of his little pigtail. If she remembered right, her friend only did that when he was either nervous or embarrassed. There was no reason to be embarrassed, unless it was for Mihoshi's comment and even this his reaction was a bit to . . . extreme for that. Sooo, it stood to reason that he was nervous about the topic. But why? Ranma decided to prod the bubbly blond a bit just to see what would come of it.<p>"So Mihoshi, When was the last time you talked to great grandmother Funaho?" She asked ever so innocently. Her voice was so cool and smooth, her expression so serene that it didn't look like butter would melt in her mouth.<p>"I don't remember exactly. I think it was about three or four earth months ago." Mihoshi answered blithely, ignoring the flinches from her family that her response brought. "She came for a visit with Azusa and Misaki. They wanted to see how their daughters were doing."<p>The blond turned to the teal haired woman sitting next to her, the one with an angry expression quickly replacing the professional look that had just been on her face.<p>"That's about right isn't it Kiyone? They came to see Yosho and Tenchi and stayed . . . "<p>"MIHOSHI! Shut up!" Kiyone interrupted the blond before she could finish her sentence.<p>"What, why?" Mihoshi looked at her partner questioningly. "I thought maybe Nodoka-san would like to know."<p>"Just shut up Mihoshi," Kiyone ground out, her voice sounding like distant thunder.<p>"So Sensei. Is there something you'd like to tell us perhaps?" Ranma put on her most kawaii expression.<p>Nodoka gave her daughter a proud look. Not only had Mihoshi revealed that "her" Funaho had been around recently, she had said "earth months". What she meant by that was anyone's guess right now, but it was obviously not something the Masaki's wanted revealed. Just what was their secret?<p>Sometimes it still amazed Nodoka just how well Michiru had turned out. Ranma might have picked up on the slip, but he would never have had the ability to pick a target and draw the information out so flawlessly.<p>"Yes Sensei. I am also curious as to what Mihoshi has to say." Nodoka added, a steely look in her eyes.<p>Katsuhito merely looked at his two students a moment before answering. "Nodoka, as you yourself just said that happened nigh on to a thousand years ago. It would be unlikely in the extreme that Tenchi's great grandmother would be the same Funaho that was your ancestor wouldn't it?"<p>"Sensei, that didn't answer mama's question?" Ranma pressed. "Now did it?"<p>Ranma's sapphire eyes never left the shining gray eyes of his teacher, nor did they miss the pride that they showed as she pressed her argument.<p>"I believe that is a matter for another time. You have pressing matters to attend to today don't you girl?"<p>Reluctantly Ranma nodded her assent. "Yes Sensei, I do have other things to take care of first."<p>Ranma and Nodoka exchanged a meaningful look. They both knew that the Masaki's were hiding something. They trusted their sensei and Tenchi, but they also knew that the matter was not over, not by a long shot. Both knew that life was much more complex than most humans would ever admit. Both had first hand knowledge and experience with the supernatural and with beings that most people considered no more than legend. Ranma herself had met ghosts, spirits, oni, demons, youma, daemons and other creatures of legend. She had conversed with (and fought with) the descendant's of dragons, fought the Phoenix King Saffron, who himself was immortal. They did not discount the possibility that Mihoshi was telling the truth, that the Funaho that she was talking about was indeed the Funaho of legend. The name itself was a major clue, it was virtually unique and was not a common . . . or even uncommon Japanese name outside of the Isagomo Clan at least.<p>"Hey Mihoshi," Ranma decided to fire one last salvo before giving up. "Who is Tenchi's great grandmother married to?"<p>"Well, her husband's name is Azusa and her co-wife's name is Misaki." The blond blurted her answer out before anyone could stop her.<p>"Mihoshi! I told you to shut up." Kiyone yelled, slapping her partner firmly on the back of her head.<p>"Of course," Ranma sighed, "Of course her husband . . . wait a minute CO- WIFE?"<p>Before she could press on Katsuhito cleared his throat. "I believe I said we would discuss this later."<p>"Hai Sensei," Ranma conceded.<p>"Hai Sensei," Nodoka echoed her daughters words before adding a few of her own. "We will talk about this later," she finished stressing the fact that this conversation was not over.<p>Once again a knowing look passed between the two red headed women. Their faces each carried a sly knowing grin. They looked so much alike it was uncanny, and the same purpose lit a fire in their eyes.<p>Ranma felt a little lightheaded at the revelations, though she doubted them not. It would not surprise her to find out that her ancestor was still alive, kept so by her husband's power, or perhaps power of her own. While much of her own abilities came from the rigorous, nigh on to insane training that she had been put through, there were still questions as to whether that alone would've been enough. Even discounting her senshi abilities she healed faster than a "normal" human, learned faster and moved faster as well. Her strength was nothing short of amazing, and Nodoka shared many of these traits. When her mama wielded a sword she could move so fast she blurred, even Ranma found her to be a tough opponent. Even as good as she had grown in the last few years it was not unusual for her mama to score hits during a spar that would've been lethal if made with steel instead of a bokken.<p>Ranma paused, then narrowed her eyes as she concentrated. Then she LOOKED at the others present. When they had arrived Ranma had done a brief ki scan, noting almost automatically the aura's of the Masaki's and their guests. This time she looked harder, looked deeper, seeking anything in their auras that would be out of the ordinary. She had to smile a bit at that thought. What she considered ordinary was a far cry from the definition used by most.<p>Sensei Masaki was first and as expected she saw him surrounded by a blue aura of incredible power. It was deeper and stronger than anyone else she had ever seen. Not even Happosai or Ku Lon's auras could compare, though they were nothing to sneeze at. She started to look even deeper when the aura diminished and nearly disappeared, damping itself to a level not much above that of a normal human. Looking up she had to fight the urge to flinch from the measuring look her sensei leveled her way.<p>Glancing over at Tenchi, she saw much the same aura, but Tenchi's was even stronger, though much less focused. Her childhood friend's aura was somewhat different than that of his grandfather. Tenchi's aura contained flashes of white intermingled with the blue, they were so bright that they nearly blinded her as they pulsed in time with his heartbeat. His aura though lacked the control of Katsuhito's. It was as if the power level he had would eventually overshadow that of his grandfather, but his ability to make use of it was less refined as of yet.<p>Ayeka was no surprise. Her aura was about the same as before. It clearly bore a relationship to that of Sensei Masaki's. It was as if they were closely related, but her overall power levels were much lower than either of the Masaki's. Nothing to laugh at, and more than a little impressive in it's own right, but still nothing compared to Tenchi or Katsuhito. Ranma could detect traces of something that didn't feel quite "normal", something was just a little "off" about it.<p>Ryoko on the other hand literally glowed with power. To Ranma's ki-senses, it was like staring into the sun, and it was nearly as bright as Tenchi's .  Her aura was crimson, but it didn't feel the same as Akane's anger enhanced aura. There was no doubt that Ryoko used her anger, but in her case it was tightly leashed and focused, under her control. Ryoko would use that anger for strength, but probably wouldn't let it take control. The red was laced with black as well. But again that was more puzzling than frightening, as the blackness didn't have the "taste" or "feel" of evil. It was more like the color came from a source of great pain or tribulation. It appeared that Ryoko had been tested in the fire, hammered by adversity and tempered by her past like the finest of blades. She was strong and sharp, definitely not one to take lightly. Ranma felt a kinship of some kind, a bond with the cyan haired beauty. It was strange how the woman's aura called to her. It wasn't sexual in nature at all. It felt more like the bond of a kindred spirit, a sister, one who could empathize with her pain, her need for a challenge. Despite her best intentions Ranma felt her mask slipping and a companionable smile forming on her lips as she looked at Ryoko. Still, there was more as well. Ryoko's aura to was not "normal" in fact the power she exuded so effortlessly was not exactly ki. Ranma didn't know what it was, only that it was there and powerful. While her aura covered her completely, it did seem to be concentrated around something in the other woman's wrists, and there was a small fluctuation around Ryoko's neck as if something were missing. What that was Ranma couldn't tell.<p>Mihoshi's aura was chaotic and hard to read, changing colors almost randomly. Ranma had never seen anything like it. It was as if it somehow resisted being seen or measured. One moment it appeared to be very powerful, the next almost non-existent, and it too bore the taint of something not quite human, but not of anything malevolent.<p>The teal tressed one Kiyone, seemed almost mundane in comparison to her companions. Her aura was a soft creamy white and while strong, was about what one would expect from a well-trained fighter. It reminded Ranma of the auras she'd seen around a group of U.S. Marines she'd run across. They had been detached to the JSDF during a particularly nasty episode involving a nest of oni-possessed humans. The military thought they were nothing more than terrorists and had requested the help of the American military. What they received was a detachment of Marine snipers. Ranma had to admit, she'd rarely seen a more focused batch of auras in her life. Their weapons had been effective against the possessed humans, but it had taken the senshi to clear out the oni. Still, once again Kiyone's aura was somehow "off" just a bit.<p>Ranma almost ignored the last two as they were no more than kids, but bitter experience had shown her long ago not to discount someone just because of their age. Even the very old and young could have abilities far beyond what could be expected . . . and there were other things that could make themselves look like whatever they wanted. If her suspicions were true and they were oni, well as the saying went "anything goes."<p>Ranma nearly sighed out loud as she turned to Washu. Of course she just had to be right. If Tenchi's aura was nearly blinding, her's was. Power surrounded her like the sun was surrounded by its corona. She had to look away, but before she did Ranma noticed similarities to the aura put out by the cyan haired Ryoko.<p>Sasami on the other hand, while her aura was powerful, it was strange in another way. It was almost as if two aura's were intermingled so closely that they were nearly one. The first blazed a pure unsullied white, but somehow the light didn't blind . . . it soothed. Hidden within the white was another, one that bore striking similarities to the aura Ayeka possessed. Before Ranma could look away she felt a powerful presence. Instead of making her fearful, the presence made her feel safe and warm, as if she were cradled in her mother's arms. A voice sounded in her head, a voice that was warm like a summer breeze and sounded like the gentle chime of bells, or the chuckling of a gentle stream.<p>Ranma shook her head in awe as she came out of her slight trance. She couldn't remember the words she'd just heard, if indeed she had been spoken to. But she could remember the feeling they left behind, a promise that all would be well. The "aura check" hadn't taken more than a dozen heartbeats, the amount of information received when she looked so deeply was not constrained by time in any normal sense of the word.<p>"So are you here just for a visit?" Tenchi asked breaking the short silence.<p>Before either woman could answer Katsuhito spoke for them.<p>"No Tenchi, they are here for a duel."<p>"What?" With who?" Tenchi's expression of puzzlement was carried nearly identically on the faces of his friends.<p>"Relax grandson, She's not here to fight any of us."<p>"Then who grandfather?"<p>"One of her other masters. A man named Happosai, Master of the Anything Goes Style of Unarmed Combat."<p>"But why here? And why fight at all?"<p>"It's a matter of honor Tenchi. I studied under the old pervert and we didn't part on the best of terms. He forbade me to use "his" Art until I could defeat him in combat." Ranma answered, then added softly. "Those were his conditions after I lost the last fight."<p>"Anything Goes huh? That's an interesting name for a style. I've never heard of it though, what kind of style is it?" This time the question came from an inquisitive redhead, her emerald eyes sparkling at the thought of gaining new knowledge.<p>Without thinking about it Washu called forth her keyboard, the holographic image appearing in front of her at her mental command.<p>"Washu!" Tenchi yelped. "What are . . . "<p>"Don't worry about it Tenchi," Ranma interrupted the boy before he could continue his rant.<p>"We already know that something is going on here . . . and we know that not all of you are even human. I'm not sure what you are, but I'd guess oni or perhaps aliens" Ranma's knowledge of the Silver Millenium was spotty, but she did remember part of her duties was protection of the solar system from attack by aliens, though she also vaguely recalled that the Moon Kingdom had allies as well as enemies in the galaxy.<p>"Interesting observation child. What makes you say that?" Washu asked, even as she typed rapidly on the keyboard.<p>"Let's see," Washu mused aloud, not even waiting for Ranma or Nodoka to respond to her last question. "Anything Goes Style, practiced currently by two families. The Saotomes and the Tendos. The Grandmaster is listed as Happosai, no clan affiliation given. Others licensed as Masters and able to teach are Saotome Genma and Tendo Soun. No students are listed, though that's not unusual. Well that's about all my computer has right now."<p>Washu turned her attention back to their guests. "I'm going to guess you did an aura reading on us at some point."<p>Ranma nodded sheepishly, then her eyes bulged out as Washu launched herself across the table and gave her a glomp of Amazonian proportions.<p>"Will you be my guinea pig?" came the question from the smaller woman.<p>Washu looked up with shining eyes that were ever so compelling, yet which for some reason made Ranma more than a little wary of agreeing to the proposal. Ranma had learned to fight the dreaded "pout" something that her male side had never been able to do. Two lives as a woman had seen to that, and had allowed her to hone her own devastatingly effective version of it. Even so, she was not completely immune to the pull of a cute girl with big eyes and quivering lips.<p>Ranma hesitated, then noticed Tenchi trying desperately to get her attention . . . and shaking his head in an emphatic NO gesture.<p>"Uhm, maybe later Washu. We can talk about that later." Ranma hedged.<p>"Oh pooh. I'll hold you to that Michiru," Washu warned.<p>Darting back to her keyboard she began typing furiously.<p>"Hold still a moment you two."<p>Washu looked at the screen, then she laughed, shooting "Michiru" a long sly look.<p>"This says you two are mother and "daughter", why don't you have the same name?"<p>Ranma flinched as she caught the slight emphasis that the other girl had put on the word daughter. Fortunately her mama came to her rescue.<p>"That's a long story as well," Nodoka began. "Basically Michiru was found by the authorities after she had been severely beaten and almost killed. Her father never showed up, and the authorities couldn't find him. Michiru had been taken from me so young that she didn't remember my name, address or anything else about me really. Her father never told her anything about me. Since they couldn't find her father and Michiru didn't know how to find me they put her in an orphanage. The Kaiou's adopted her and brought her into their Clan. It was just an amazing stoke of luck that we ever met . . . and I've thanked the Kami every day since then."<p>"Why didn't you get her back once you found out?" This time it was Mihoshi who asked. The blond was entranced by the "soap opera like" story.<p>"By the time we were sure about it," Nodoka answered, the Kaiou's had raised Michiru for many years. She felt honor bound to accept that bond."<p>Nodoka was rather proud of her answer. It was truthful . . . so far as it went, it just 'twisted" the facts a bit. Perhaps later, if Michiru agreed they could tell the full truth. It did seem likely that if Michiru's analysis of their ki was accurate, (and which was confirmed by her own lesser abilities) these people might be able to accept the truth. The Masaki crew for the most part seemed to accept the story as told. Nodoka and Ranma both saw the measuring looks that were directed their way by Katsuhito and surprisingly enough Sasami, but could tell that they were going to hold their peace . . . at least for now.<p>Washu for her part only smiled, according to her computer, Nodoka only had one child . . . and HIS name wasn't Michiru.<p>"Would you like some more tea?" Sasami asked gently.<p>Her mind once more on the "curse" Ranma smiled. She knew that if the curse hadn't been locked that right about now was when it would've been revealed.  Her words proved only to prophetic when Mihoshi stretched bumping into the younger girl causing her to spill the hot liquid all over "Michiru".<p>Ranma smiled gently and accepted Mihoshi's rather exuberant apology. One thing she definitely didn't miss was the looks of shock and revulsion she used to experience when her curse was revealed.<p>"Now about this duel . . . "Tenchi began, and the conversation turned to the events yet to come this day.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Setsuna-mama. Is it time to go yet?" Hotaru asked for the umpteenth time.<p>"Yes dear, it's time," Setsuna answered patiently.<p>At least she appeared patient, inside she was just as anxious as her young charge to find out what was going to happen. It was so frustrating sometimes to deal with herself. Future Pluto could be just so . . . irritating. Despite what the other Scouts thought, she herself was not immune to feeling frustrated when "Sailor Pluto" acted so mysterious, even the fact that she knew there was a reason for it, and even when it was her doing it to herself.<p>"Good, I can't wait to see what happens next," Chibi-Usa chimed in. "I mean I've heard about this from Michiru, but to see it is going to be soooooo cooooool."<p>"See what Small Lady?" Setsuna asked slyly.<p>"Ah, Ah, Ah," Usa smirked.<p>Pluto's frustration only grew when Usa smiled that knowing smile and refused to answer. It was a smile she had seen on her own face in the mirror many times. Setsuna snorted. She was definitely going to have to tell her future self NOT to teach that smile to the young princess.<p>"USA!" Hotaru growled, "Stop that. Can't you tell us anything?"<p>"Sorry Hotaru," Usa apologized. "I'm afraid I can't, not really. Ma . . . Michiru has told me about some of what happened today. But I had to promise Pu-chan to let it play out without telling you anything until after it's all settled. She said it was important that I be here, but didn't say why. She just told me to "do what I thought was right." Usa's voice at the last was a credible imitation of Pluto's as she repeated the elder senshi's words.<p>"She said it would work out best if you did what was in your heart instead of trying to work out some kind of plan."<p>Seeing the surprised looks on her companion's faces the pink haired girl giggled.<p>"I know. I was surprised too. That didn't sound like anything I expected her to say."<p>"If you are quite finished mocking me . . . I mean her . . . we need to go," Setsuna advised. "Lets find a quiet place to leave from."<p>"Where are we going mama?" Hotaru asked quietly as the trio moved toward the exit.<p>"We are going to a small shrine. Whatever is going to happen is supposed to occur at the Masaki shrine around noon. We need to leave now so that we can walk to the proper location."<p>The two let Chibi-Usa take the lead. Once she was a few steps in front Hotaru whispered, "Did you hear what Usa almost said?"<p>Setsuna nodded, her thoughts all a whirl. For a moment she thought she'd imagined it, but if Hotaru had heard it as well then it wasn't her imagination. Usa HAD almost called Michiru "mama". But what could that mean. She'd seen the future and seen the pink haired girl dressed as the Moon Princess. On top of that, the girl's senshi transformation was into Chibi-Moon. That had to mean that Usagi was her mother, didn't it? and if Usagi was her mother why did she almost call Neptune mama? Things were getting "curiousier and curiousier" to steal a phrase from Alice in Wonderland.<p>"Yes I did Hotaru-chan, and no I don't know what she meant either." Setsuna answered Hotaru's unspoken question before it even left her lips.<p>It didn't take them long to find a secluded nook deep in a trash filled alley. While not the most fragrant of locations it did offer what they were looking for. A place that couldn't be seen from the street and which was currently unoccupied.<p>Joining hands they once again put their trust in Setsuna and teleported.<p>Less than a heartbeat later they arrived, finding themselves in a small glen surrounded by large trees.<p>"It's so pretty here," Usa murmured.<p>Her companions didn't speak, but nodded their own agreement.<p>"We need to go this way," Setsuna pointed off to the east. "It shouldn't be far."<p>With no further ado, the three began hiking up toward the hills. It was the work of just a few minutes before they stopped again. This time they were at the edge of a large meadow. Before them the woods opened up into a large grassy area, dotted here and there with wildflowers. The meadow itself was probably two hundred or so yards wide and perhaps three hundred in length.<p>"Settle in girls, we've got a short wait," Setsuna eyed the sun as it approached its zenith, it was growing close to the appointed time.<p>"I'd say we have about twenty minutes to wait," Setsuna finished.<p>"Wow, you can tell that by the sun's position?" Chibi-Usa was rather impressed by the observation.<p>Setsuna's knowing smirk faltered when Hotaru laughed.<p>"Well that and the fact that I saw her glancing at her watch," the young Princess of Saturn said mirthfully.<p>"Hrmph," Setsuna groused momentarily before joining Hotaru and laughing softly.<p>She had to admit the look on Usa's face was at least some payback for her previously "mysterious ways."<p>The three found a good place to watch. Their view was relatively unobstructed, but also a location where it would be hard for someone in the sunlit meadow to see them. They conversed in whispers to pass the time, and before they knew it noon was upon them.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Guys that's Kasumi," Hotaru whispered as they watched the first of the gathering arrive. "and that must be Happosai," Hotaru shuddered. "They told me stories about HIM, he's not very nice."<p>"What do you mean?" Chibi-Usa asked quietly. "And if he's not nice why is Kasumi with him? I thought you said she was really nice."<p>"She is," Hotaru insisted, "I'm not sure why she's with him. She did call him grandfather though."<p>"So what's the part about him not being nice?" Usa pressed, her voice growing a bit louder.<p>"Shh, keep it down girls," Setsuna warned.<p>Hotaru and Chibi-Usa gave her an apologetic look before returning to their conversation.<p>"Kasumi said he was a pervert."<p>"Pervert?"<p>"Yeah, she said he like to steal girls underwear."<p>Usa shuddered, "That is weird."<p>"That's not the half of it," Hotaru blushed, "Kasumi said he does it while the girls are wearing them."<p>"What?" How? Does he force them to strip naked or something?" Usa's anger was clear and once again she had to struggle to keep her voice down.<p>"No, she said he can somehow take them off a girl without taking her clothes off first."<p>"Huh, how can he do that?"<p>Hotaru shrugged, "I don't know, but that's what she said and mama agreed with her."<p>"Definitely weird."<p>"Yeah, definitely," Hotaru agreed. "But it still doesn't say why mama's here to meet him."<p>They could see Kasumi and Happosai talking, but the others were to far away to make any sense of their words. A few minutes later they spotted a much larger group approaching from the other end of the meadow.<p>Michiru was easy to spot, her strange wardrobe made her stand out from the crowd. Walking next to her and on her left side was the woman they'd seen earlier. On the right was an older gentleman they'd never seen before. He was wearing the robes of a Shinto priest and exuded a peaceful calm that was apparent even from this distance. Right behind them came several girls and one young man. The girls varied in appearance and their hair colors reminded the young Saturn of the Amazons she'd met yesterday. The boy was flanked by a pair of exotic beauties. A woman in purple robes with long purple hair to match was clinging on one arm. The other arm was occupied by a cyan haired beauty in a simple housedress. Behind them in a loose grouping was a collection of other girls. The most normal of whom had long blond hair that looked to be a match to either Usagi or Minako. Next to her was a young girl with hair the same shade that Michiru normally sported, and yet another woman with teal green hair. Trailing the group a few feet further back was a young girl with long red hair that was a match for the Michiru's own fiery locks.<p>Most of the new group stopped at the edge of the meadow, with only the three in the lead moving further in.<p>The trio watched as Michiru moved in, stopping a few yards away from Kasumi and Happosai. The older man and woman moved a few yards to Michiru's left and stopped as well.<p>The three senshi listened carefully as Michiru began to speak.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma saw Happosai and her eyes narrowed. This was it, today was the day she either regained the right to practice her Art or lost it forever. She smiled a Kasumi, waved her friend over toward the Masaki group, then frowned at Happosai. She looked around the meadow, and for a moment thought she sensed the presence of watchers, familiar presences, but ones that shouldn't be here now, but she couldn't be sure and didn't have time to look further.<p>Shaking her head Ranma tried to forget about who might or might not be watching. She had to keep her attention focused, if she didn't she was going to lose . . . and that was something she didn't want to even contemplate.<p>Before she could even speak Ranma saw the gleam in the old pervert's eyes. He darted forward and in two bounces leaped for her chest. Ranma darted aside and managed to avoid his grasp.<p>"Now that wasn't very nice Ranma-chan," Happosai yelled.<p>"How about a letting your old Master have a feel of those beauties?" he continued with a fake pout while pointing a battered pipe at her chest.<p>"Drop dead old man," Ranma growled. "First we set the terms, then we fight. Groping comes later if at all."<p>Ranma fought for calm. If she were going to beat the old perv she was going to need it. Taking a deep breath and trying to ignore the light that flashed in Happosai's eyes when she did, Ranma continued.<p>"This is our second and last match as set by your terms the last time we met,"<p>"Now Ranma-chan, that isn't exactly what I said and you know it," Happosai interrupted. "I said if you didn't beat me in three months you had to accept me as your Master and take my training . . . all of it or you'd lose the right to practice Anything Goes. I also said you couldn't use the Art other than practice until we met today."<p>"I know what you said old man," Ranma answered her voice crackling with ice.<p>"I'm telling you that if I don't win today I'm giving up my right to practice your style."<p>"My style. Does that mean you've learned another Art?"<p>Ranma smirked unpleasantly, the expression a twisted shadow of her old confident . . . and very annoying smile.<p>"You'll see what I've learned in a few minutes. Now as to the terms. Here's my proposal. We fight. No time limit, area is restricted to this meadow. The first to submit, be knocked out or leave the meadow under his or her own power loses."<p>"What if I knock you out of the meadow?"<p>"I said leave under their own power. If anyone is knocked out of the meadow they have no more than thee minutes to return or they lose." Ranma rejoined.<p>"What do I get from this when I win?" Happosai sneered.<p>"Keep thinking that old man," Ranma thought, "You think I've only had three months to train. Well what you don't know is definitely going to hurt you today."<p>"If you win. I will give up the right to practice Anything Goes. I still keep the right to my special attacks, but not yours, Genma's or Soun's. I can still create my own art from what I've learned from the Amazons, and from Sensei Masaki." Ranma indicated Katsuhito with her thumb. "As well as the other traditional arts."<p>"That's not enough boy. I want more or it won't be worth my time. I can already forbid you to practice Anything Goes."<p>"I figured as much old man. I will agree in addition to pose for you in a full spread of pictures. No more than fifty total. I will have them made into a full color portfolio and give you three copies." Ranma could see the glazed look forming on the old perv's face.<p>"No more than ten nudes, the rest in lingerie, swimsuits or whatever," she paused for effect. "You can pick the outfits. In addition, I'll arrange for an apartment and stay with you for one week. No sex, no-one else to be there, but . . ." she shuddered with distaste, "during that time I'll not fight off your gropes. Finally I'll wear the outfits that you had me pose in while at home, and give them to you at the end of the week."<p>Ranma could see the sheer lust forming in Happosai's eyes at the thought of what she was offering. As much as the price of losing disgusted her, she knew the old letch had some honor. Her "virtue" was safe. He might be a pervert, but Happosai was no rapist. It would be Hell with a capital H, but she could do it if she had to.<p>"I have your word on that boy?"<p>"You have my word."<p>"And if by some chance you win, what do you want?"<p>"You certify me as a Master of Anything goes. Equal to the other Masters and no longer subject to their control. You sign my license to teach. Then you leave me the Hell alone. You don't look for me. You leave my friends and family alone . . . you get the Hell out of my life."<p>"What about the skills I haven't taught you yet?" Happosai offered. He didn't really think he'd lose, but the thought of having no ties to the one he'd picked as his heir did leave him cold. He might be three hundred or so years old, but even he had to admit he'd not live forever.<p>"IF and ONLY IF you swear not to reveal any of my secrets, and swear to leave my friends and family alone I will consider letting you finish my training," Ranma answered after a short pause. "BUT, I keep the right to refuse to accept your teaching if I think you're just being perverted. I will NOT take part in liberating any of your "silky darlings.""<p>Happosai didn't hesitate for long. He was sure he could still beat Ranma, though there was something about the Ranma's serious attitude that was pricking at the back of his mind.<p>"Done boy. Are you ready to dance?"<p>"Not yet," Ranma answered shortly. "Sensei Nodoka and Masaki will be the judges. Do you accept them?"<p>Happosai glanced at the pair standing quietly by. He could sense the anger they held for him. Nodoka's was almost palpable, but he knew the woman well. Her sense of honor would keep her in line. If he won she would so rule. The other man put him on edge. Happosai could feel the power he held. It was nearly equal to his own. Furthermore, the Master of Anything Goes had heard of this man before. Masaki Katsuhito was not well known to the general martial arts community, but to those who were true masters his name was known. He was reputed to be the best swordsman in Japan. True, he had never competed in the tournaments like Nodoka, but many of the very best did not. It had been years since he had competed in any formal tournament himself. However, much like Nodoka, Katsuhito was known to be honorable. It was said that when Masaki Katsuhito gave his word you could take it to the bank.<p>"What about the rest?" Happosai pointed first at the group gathered behind Ranma-chan, then quickly to the ones hidden in the woods.<p>"They are here simply to watch," Ranma replied shortly.<p>"And if they interfere?"<p>"If they intervene on my behalf I lose," came the calm reply.<p>"Then sweet Ranma-chan, I accept your terms," Happosai answered soberly.<p>For a moment, just a fleet, quicksilver moment that was gone as quickly as it came, Ranma could see the remnants of the Master that Happosai once was . . . and Ranma mourned what could have been. She nodded once and fell instinctively into a defensive stance.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Hotaru shivered as she heard her mama begin to speak. What the heck was going on? How did mama know this old man? When could she have studied the martial arts under him and why would he have made her quit? Why was he calling her "boy" was it to make her mad? If so why? Was he mad that mama was a lesbian? Had he kicked her out of her school because of Haruka-papa?  Mama was a lot of things but "boyish" was not one of them. Hotaru loved her Michiru-mama and wanted to be just like her . . . well except that she liked boys that is. Whatever the old man had on her mama, the way he was acting made her furious, and made her wish for the Silence Glaive. Only her mama's words that she would lose if there was any outside interference was keeping her from dropping a major load of mojo on the old man's head. Well that and the thought of what Michiru-mama would do to her if she caused her to lose and she had to honor her agreement with the old pervert. That scared her even more . . . she'd be lucky if mama ungrounded her by the founding of Crystal Tokyo if that were to happen.<p>"What's going on?" she whispered desperately.<p>"I don't know dear, I don't know," Setsuna whispered back.<p>Setsuna was at a loss. In all her viewing of Michiru's life, she'd never seen her act like this. She been fascinated by the way Michiru picked up the martial arts. She'd watched many a training session as the girl grew up. The Time Gates made viewing her friends past far to easy and she had indulged herself often during the long lonely years before their awakening. She had missed Uranus, Neptune and Saturn. During the Silver Millennium they had been among her few friends.<p>As a result she had monitored their lives closely. Setsuna had seen many of Neptune's sensei, but she'd never seen this Happosai before. Secrets were abounding, and if there was one trait she shared with Mercury, she hated secrets . . . unless they were her secrets of course, and even then she didn't always like what her job required her to do.<p>"I can't believe she'd agree to all of that if she lost," Usa whispered. "That's awful."<p>"Me neither," Hotaru agreed. "I guess we'd better be asking the Kami for her to win."<p>The senshi of Saturn was frankly at a loss. Her mama might be willing to cuddle and kiss Haruka no matter who was around, but to pose NUDE for a man, to make what was in effect a porno magazine for him to look at. What the HELL was her mama up to? Hotaru knew, absolutely one hundred percent knew, that her mama had NO interest in men . . . at least she thought she knew that she added uncomfortably. After all the revelations that had come to light in the last few days Hotaru was wondering if she really did know her mama. Yet despite the distaste clearly evident in Michiru's voice she was agreeing, well not even agreeing, she was proposing the terms she was going to have to honor if she lost.<p>"Uhm, Setsuna-mama, Chibi-Usa," Hotaru began hesitantly, "Why was that old man calling her Ranma and boy?"<p>The Moon Princess fidgeted. She knew, but really did not want to be the one to tell Hotaru the truth . . . and to be quite honest even though she knew the truth in her head, her heart had never accepted it. She had known Michiru all her life and had never seen her as anything but a woman. Usa decided that discretion was the better part of valor and simply ignored the question.<p>"Usa . . . "Hotaru hissed somewhat angrily, starting to press for an answer. "I don't . . . "<p>Before she could push her friend further, the two martial artists . . . moved . . . if so mundane a term could be used to describe their quicksilver actions.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Uhm, Tenchi?" Ryoko questioned hesitantly, "What's going on with your friend?"<p>"I don't know Ryoko. I've never seen her like this," Tenchi's response was just as hesitant.<p>"Lord Tenchi, did she just agree to be in a pornographic magazine?"<p>Before the young prince could answer he heard Ryoko laughing.<p>"I'm surprised at you Princess. I'm surprised that a repressed old prude like you even knows what one of those is."<p>Ayeka for once refused to rise to the bait. She sniffed once disdainfully before answering.<p>"Just because I know what one of those things is doesn't mean that I'm likely to show up in one . . . unlike a certain harlot I could name."<p>"At least they'd line up for blocks to get a magazine with my hot bod in it," Ryoko responded. "They'd probably run the other way if someone tried . . . "<p>"Ayeka, Ryoko stop it!" Sasami interrupted. "Michiru doesn't need to be distracted by you two right now."<p>"Right," Ryoko agreed.<p>"I agree Sasami," Ayeka admitted. "If they are friends of Yosho we should support them."<p>"Friends," Washu cackled softly, "I think they are more than friends. If I'm right, and I usually am, they are his distant cousins. The readings I got on them indicate that they are indeed of Funaho's line."<p>"Then it is even more important that Michiru win," Ayeka insisted. "If word were to get out that a relative of the Emperor's First Wife were in a pornographic magazine that would not bode well in some circles."<p>Ryoko's laughter was more wry than mocking as she replied. "They allow people to be married to more than one spouse and turn their nose up at a little nudity?"<p>"Ryoko, I'm serious. It would harm Lord Tenchi's reputation as well. After all he is Aunty Funaho's great grandson."<p>"I still find it hard to believe that something like this could be so bad," Ryoko answered.<p>"It's not the nudity, it's the . . . "Ayeka searched for the proper words, ". . . it's the fact that a pornographic magazine is just so "common". No- one of the nobility would stoop to posing for such a thing."<p>"But the relationship is awfully distant Ayeka," Tenchi pointed out. "Why would it matter what she did?"<p>"Tenchi, Tenchi Tenchi, you are so innocent aren't you?" Washu piped up, more than a trace of venom in her voice as she recalled a loss of her own caused by a noble family's disdain for her own "common" lineage.<p>"Nobility, especially Jurian nobility can trace even the smallest amount of noble blood. It comes from living so long and considering themselves the Lords of Creation."<p>The others were a bit shocked at the malice in her tone. "Now don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about the majority, but there are enough pig-headed idiots out there to whom a person's lineage is more important than anything else."<p>"What about her . . . her preferences?" Tenchi could barely get the words out. He was a bit embarrassed to be talking about such things with the girls.<p>"That doesn't matter so long as it is private or between spouses," Sasami piped up.<p>"Sasami, how long have you been listening?" Tenchi was mortified to find the young princess had been following the entire conversation.<p>"Tenchi, I may be young but I'm not stupid. Besides, don't you think Aunty Funaho and Mother Misaki get along well?"<p>Any answer Tenchi might have been able to muster was lost when Ryoko gasped.<p>"Damn, would you take a look at that! It's like watching grasshoppers on speed."<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma watched with narrowed eyes as Happosai fell into his "standard" stance. It was a relaxed position that to most would look like the old man was completely unprepared for battle. To a practitioner of Anything Goes however, it was a different matter. Despite his appearance the Grandmaster was more than prepared to fight.<p>For several long moments both were motionless, each watching and waiting for any indication that the other was about to initiate combat. Then as if in response to an inaudible signal they moved.<p>Ranma leapt forward bounding like a demented rabbit. Happosai was more restrained in his motions, but moved just as quickly. They met in a flurry of blows, punches thrown and blocked, kicks flowing into other moves as they exchanged attacks. Both started out conservatively, at least for masters with their skill level they were conservative. In the first exchange there were no fancy moves as both knew that the first to make a mistake was going to be the first to take damage . . . and perhaps the first to lose.<p>Both fighters knew that they could soak up damage that would kill a lesser being, but neither wanted to be the first injured. Even limited as they were to non-lethal moves it was certain that (barring a major mistake) one or both of them were going to end up hurt. Both knew as well that there would be no giving up, no surrender despite that being one of the options available to them. They knew that the victor was going to be the one left standing over the prone body of the other fighter.<p>As quickly as the melee started it was over as the fighters separated. Neither was breathing at anything other than a normal level and neither was significantly hurt. They both sported bruises and both felt the damage that even successful blocks brought.<p>"Is that all you have boy?" Happosai taunted.<p>"I'm just getting warmed up," Ranma answered, "Why don't we kick it up a notch?"<p>"That's okay by me," Happosai agreed.<p>True to his word the ancient martial artist let loose some of the control he kept on his ki and was soon surrounded by a glowing aura of stormy gray.  Ranma did likewise and soon she too was surrounded by her battle aura, though hers was a brightly glowing blue.<p>Ranma sensed the build-up of ki and knew that she had to be prepared for anything. Gathering her own energy she waited, and was soon rewarded by Happosai's yell.<p>"Happo Battle Aura Blast!"<p>"Moko Takabisha!"<p>The ki blasts met, and where they met there was a blinding flash as the ki bolts merged for a moment then exploded. Both fighters knew what was coming so neither was thrown to the ground. Instead they immediately followed their ki attacks by closing in once more.<p>This time their meeting was in mid-air. They seemed to ignore gravity as they hung in the air before gliding past each other. This time, without the need to worry about their footing, kicks predominated over the less powerful punches they'd thrown earlier. This exchange was just as inconclusive as the first, both gave and accepted damage, but neither was conclusively injured. When they landed Ranma immediately bounded back toward her foe, hoping that she had recovered just a bit quicker than Happosai.<p>Indeed she had, and before the other warrior could quite put up his defenses she sneaked a brutal kick in past the old master's defenses, the blow taking Happosai in the ribs. Ranma knew it was not a decisive blow, but still landing the first real hit was a good sign. Before she could follow it up however, Happosai used his pipe and executed a near perfect Happo Throw, tossing Ranma several yards away and giving the Grandmaster time to recover.<p>"Not bad boy," Happosai acknowledged the hit, "But not nearly good enough,"<p>"Happo Five Yen Satsu,"<p>Ranma tried to move, and was partially successful, but not completely so. She was taken a bit by surprise by the attack, but even with the little time that she had to react she still managed to prevent him from locking onto her. Happosai's attack hit and drained a significant portion of her battle aura. Fortunately, she had more in reserve and even more fortunately she had not been hit dead on by the attack.<p>"You almost got me then old man," Ranma called out as she took a moment to recover. "I should've known that you knew how to do that. After all you taught Ms. Hinako that move."<p>"There's a lot more where that came from Ranma-chan. Why don't you just give up now?" Happosai taunted.<p>"Give up?" I don't think so. I have a few secrets left of my own."<p>Pulling a page from her father's book, Ranma faded away, becoming effectively invisible.<p>"I see you've mastered the Umi-sen-ken," Happosai crowed. "Those are one of the few things that your father ever did that was worthwhile. They are good, but it won't be enough to beat me boy."<p>"Okuhida Hurricane," Happosai called out another of his special attacks.<p>Happosai spun his pipe rapidly, and a whirlwind of his "silky darlings" filled the clearing between Ranma-chan's last position and the crafty Grandmaster. Happosai watched and as soon as he saw some of the garments stop, wrapping around something not seen, he pounced.<p>Ranma was surprised at the method Happosai used, but NOT surprised that the old man had a counter to the Umi-sen-ken. She had hoped she was mistaken and that the way of the silent thief would allow her to attack invisibly, but she had not pinned her hopes on it . . . and she doubted that Happosai knew exactly where she was.<p>Moving quickly to block his attack, Ranma took a punch to the face, but rolled with it and even as she fell struck out with a kick of her own, which connected as well, even if it was a glancing blow. Reeling from the punch, Ranma dropped the Saotome forbidden technique and faded back into sight.<p>Both fighters moved in again, this time redoubling the fury of their attacks. They were still moving at speeds far beyond that of any "normal" fighter. Ranma quickly launched a series of kicks, each blocked and then a spinning back fist which was not. The punch connected, hitting the older man just below his right temple. Happosai contented himself with blocks followed by a snap-kick to Ranma's chest.<p>Ranma felt blinding pain as the kick connected with her breasts, and rolled away to gain more room to fight.<p>"Moko Takabisha Revised Shotgun Attack," she hollered out her attack.<p>Instead of a single large blast she quickly launched a barrage of smaller ki balls, each individually weaker than her standard attack, but also much harder to dodge.<p>Happosai's knowing smirk when he saw that Ranma-chan's aim was off died a quick and gruesome death. The smirk was replaced by grimace of surprise, as he saw the result of the modified attack. Unable to avoid the multiple blasts Happosai desperately strengthened his battle aura, which quickly flared at his call, providing him with much needed protection. Despite his best efforts, the multiple blasts still HURT, and knocked the perverted martial artist away from his target.<p>Ranma recovered quickly and began looking for her opponent, spotting him wobbling a few yards away. Happosai was far from finished though, his face settled into grim lines, but he'd obviously been hurt by her last attack to judge by his smoking gi . . . and the look of concentration on his face.<p>"Happo Daikarin,"<p>"Crap," was Ranma's only response as the diminutive master of Anything Goes started pulling and throwing his trademark bombs, one after another in rapid succession.<p>Dodging frantically, the young woman was able to avoid most of the blasts . . . but like Happosai moments before, was not able to dodge them all. Staggering back she smiled through her pain and called up still more of her awesome reserves.<p>The fight by now had lasted nearly fifteen interminable minutes. Not a long time as the clock goes, but an incredible display given the intensity of the conflict they were taking part in.<p>"That's it boy," Happosai crowed, "Now lets take it to the final level."<p>"Fine with me old man," Ranma gritted out. "Let's dance."<p>Once again the pair closed and once again their forms literally blurred so great was their speed. They exchanged blows at an insane rate that was nearly impossible to follow. Of the watchers in the Masaki household few could follow the blow by blow action, Katsuhito and Nodoka had little problem, Ryoko could see it as well as could Tenchi, though the Jurian Prince had to summon a bit of his Jurian power to do so. The others had to be satisfied with the play by play coming from Washu. The fight was believable only because they audience were actually seeing it.<p>The senshi were no better off, of them Pluto was the only one to clearly see the action.<p>The pair battled in the clearing, time seeming to slow to a crawl, the silence punctuated only by the sounds of flesh viciously coming into contact with flesh. Long minutes passed as the pair bounced around the meadow in an aerial display that was second to none. The action on the ground during the few moments they touched down was just as intense. Finally the pair separated again. This time it was clear to all who had eyes to see that the end was near. Happosai landed roughly, even at a distance it was clear that his right kneecap was not where it was supposed to be. The old warrior paused and with a grimace of pain pulled on his left shoulder popping it back into place. He wavered, nearly falling, kept on his feet by pride and a desire not to lose.<p>Ranma landed better, but cradled her right arm with her left. Tears of pain flowed from her eyes as she took a moment to tuck the offending arm into her belt. It was obviously broken as the sharp jagged end of a bone protruded through the forearm of her shirt, the red silk darkened by blood.<p>"Do you surrender boy?" Happosai called, pain evident in his voice as well.<p>"Never," came the grunted reply.<p>"Don't say I didn't offer you a chance Ranma,"<p>"Bring it on," was the girl's only reply.<p>Happosai nodded. He knew better than to underestimate the redhead. He knew that if killing attacks had been allowed that the fight would have been over long before and he was uncertain as to which of them would be still standing. The Grandmaster stood his ground, waiting for the attack he knew was coming. Though both had ki yet to spare, he was betting that Ranma-chan was going to go with a physical attack. She undoubtedly knew his mobility was going to be greatly hampered and was going to take full advantage of that fact. He wasn't disappointed when Ranma blurred forward.<p>Ranma knew that she had to finish this quickly. The pain from her arm was intense, nothing she couldn't handle, but it was sapping her strength. Gritting her teeth she attacked. She still had a few surprises left.<p>"Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken Revised,"<p>Happosai hear the attack and moved quickly to block Ranma's one-armed punches. To his utter surprise and dismay however it was not the fist he should have worried about. Moving at Amaguriken speeds Ranma launched a series of kicks with a speed that amazed even the old Grandmaster.<p>Reeling from the unexpected attacks Happosai was unable to mount an effective defense. Kick after kick landed dealing out massive amounts of damage to the martial artist. Grunting with pain Happosai managed to grab Ranma's right leg, and hit it with a ki enhanced punch.<p>"I"ve won!" Happosai exulted, only to realize that the leg had been a ploy, a sacrifice as Ranma struck with a punch.<p>Even as he heard the crack of her thigh bone breaking he felt a punch land on his right temple followed immediately by one to the left side of his skull. Happosai didn't even have time to realize that he had lost before sliding into unconsciousness.<p>Ranma fell on top of her opponent, her leg still held fast in his grasp.<p>"Gotta stand up, gotta stand up," she repeated the mantra to herself as she tried to rise.<p>Fighting the pain she tried once, twice then a third time before she could get to her feet.<p>Wobbling, her eyes clouded with pain Ranma looked down at her old "Master" a feeling of triumph finally beginning to rise within her. Then she heard a voice calling her name. It was a voice once all to familiar to her, but which had grown distant during her new lives, still she should have expected to hear from the "Lost Boy," now that she was dressed as "Ranma" again. With a groan she turned to face it, knowing that she was in no shape to defend herself.<p>"Saotome Ranma, Prepare to Die,"<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"I don't believe this," Ryoko stated with amazement. "Look at them go."<p>"Are you sure they are just human?" Ayeka echoed the cyan haired woman's disbelief though she used different words.<p>"I think . . . I think so," Tenchi offered.<p>The young prince knew that Michiru was good. Heck he'd sparred with her before, but he had never seen her move this fast. She was moving as fast as his grandfather did when he went all out.<p>"Definitely human," Washu offered, her fingers flying over the keyboard. "It's amazing really. Of course I'm showing Jurian energy from both of them."<p>"Jurian energy?" Kiyone asked, "But how?"<p>"Well," Washu dropped into lecture mode. "This was a Jurian colony at one point. It's to be expected that some traces of that lineage would come forth from time to time."<p>"Traces?" Ayeka offered, "I've seen members of the Royal Guard that couldn't move that fast."<p>"Aunty Funaho can," Sasami chimed in. "She's human."<p>"True, "Washu patted the young girl on the head. "Most humans have some potential to use Jurian energy, but most have no clue how to do so, and even if they did they wouldn't call it that."<p>"Ouch, that had to hurt," Mihoshi winced as she saw Michiru's arm.<p>"Is she going to be able to continue?" Kiyone asked.<p>"Don't worry about her, she's not finished yet," surprisingly it was Sasami who answered, her voice somehow deeper and wiser.<p>"Is that you Tsunami?"<p>"Yes Washu, I'm here. It is important that Michiru win this fight."<p>The others stared as Tsunami's form wavered into existence, somehow forming around the young Jurian princess.<p>"Important how?" Ryoko questioned, her eyes staring at the combatants.<p>"That isn't important just yet," Tsunami answered, a knowing twinkle in her eyes. "Let's just say that it will be important in the future."<p>Ryoko grunted, knowing that no matter how strong she was, Tsunami was one person, being, whatever that the former space pirate couldn't intimidate or force to reveal what she wished to keep a secret.<p>The group watched as the final moments of the conflict played out. They groaned as Michiru's kick was caught, winced at the sound of breaking bone, and watched in amazement as Michiru turned what looked to be a resounding defeat into victory. A victory bought at a price, but a victory none-the- less.<p>To their amazement, Nodoka and Katsuhito had no more than named Michiru the victor when they heard an angry male voice screaming a challenge. They weren't sure what was going on as he was yelling to a Saotome Ranma, but then again, that was what the old man had called Michiru.<p>To their consternation, they saw a young man, probably no more than Tenchi's age running toward Michiru with hate-filled eyes . . . and an umbrella of all things held ready to deliver his attack.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"What the Hell?" Setsuna mused, not realizing that she spoke aloud as she watched the combat between Michiru and Happosai begin.<p>She watched in amazement as the two attacked each other with a skill that she had seldom seen . . . and moves she had never seen. It was only her use of the time gates to watch some of the legendary Masters (hey everyone had to have a hobby she often told herself) that allowed her to recognize a few of the moves being used.<p>Michiru was using a strange blend from many different Arts. Pluto recognized Kempo, Kung Fu of various branches, Amazonian Wu Shu as well as some of the more "modern" arts as well. The old man was doing the same. Both fighters effortlessly blended into a unified Art, techniques from many varied and disparate forms. One minute they'd be using a hard form as they attacked, the next a soft form in defense. It was amazing really just how easy they made it look.<p>Despite having observed Michiru's skills from time to time the green haired senshi was shocked speechless at the level of skill being displayed.<p>"Setsuna-mama, What the Hell is going on?" Hotaru queried. The young senshi grew annoyed when she was being ignored. "Setsuna-mama, Setsuna!"<p>Pluto's musing were interrupted by her young charge's voice.<p>"Yes Hotaru-chan," she replied absently, her eyes never leaving the combat.<p>"Is Michiru-mama transformed and in disguise?"<p>"No dear, I don't think so,"<p>"Then how is she moving so fast?"<p>"I don't know that either, Chibi-Usa what can you tell us about this?"<p>"Yeah Usa, What's going on?"<p>"She's that good," came the soft reply. "Michiru-mama is just that good,"<p>"Michiru-mama!" Hotaru pulled her eyes away from the meadow and toward her pink haired companion.<p>"Damn! Slipped again," Usa muttered distractedly.<p>"Well, remember what I told you about our fiancée?<p>"Uhm, yeah," Hotaru answered hesitantly,<p>"Well . . . "<p>"What fiancée?" Pluto interrupted.<p>"Well Hotaru and I are engaged in the future," Usa answered quietly. "He's a Jurian Prince."<p>"Oh," Pluto responded, "and I suppose that multiple wife rule is still in effect?" she stated more than questioned.<p>"Yes it is." Usa answered reluctantly. "We don't . . . I mean won't mind he's really . . . "<p>"We can talk about that later. Why are you calling Michiru Mama now?"<p>"Well, when Hotaru and I got engaged to the same guy Michiru said I could call her that anytime except when we were training." Usa replied. "She's been like another mama to me anyway."<p>"Oh," unusually, Pluto was at a loss for words and didn't have any other response.<p>"Mama!" Hotaru yelled starting to rise to her feet.<p>"Down child, remember your promise. Don't distract her," Pluto and Usa both grabbed the young Princess of Saturn.<p>"But mama's hurt. Look at her arm."<p>The two senshi looked, and saw that Hotaru spoke the truth. They could see the white bone glistening in the summer sun. Michiru's arm was clearly broken.<p>"She lost!" Hotaru moaned, "Now she's going to have to do all those horrible things for that old man."<p>"Don't count her out yet," Pluto pointed, "It doesn't look like she's finished."<p>"But she's going to really hurt herself if she keeps this up," Hotaru wailed.<p>"Maybe so," Pluto answered striving for calm. "But do you really think she would appreciate you interfering in her fight?"<p>"I guess not," Hotaru grumbled, "But when this is over I'm going to give her a piece of my mind."<p>"When its over, but not before Hotaru-chan, not before," Setsuna warned.<p>Dropping back down the trio watched as the combat grew even more fierce. They watched as the pair exchanged a final flurry of blows. All three winced at the sound of breaking bone and saw the agony on Michiru's face as Happosai broke her leg. Then watched in amazement as she responded with a pair of savage blows to the older man's skull, dropping him in his tracks.<p>They watched silently, wishing with every fiber of their being that they could come to Michiru's aid, but knowing that to do so before she stood was to invite disaster.<p>"Look, she's getting up," Chibi-Usa cheered.<p>She knew that Michiru had won . . . at least she had in her own timeline, but also knew that things could change. They watched in silence as Michiru stood, wobbling and leaning to one side as if fighting a strong wind, but standing nonetheless. It was a matter of moments before the announcement came from the Shrine Priest. They heard his words with relief.<p>"The winner, Kaiou Michiru."<p>"Let's go," Setsuna instructed.<p>"But mama's hurt," Hotaru protested.<p>"Remember no interference Hotaru-chan," Setsuna fixed a gimlet glare at her young charge.<p>To her surprise Hotaru didn't flinch, but returned her gaze with a titanium stare of her own.<p>"I know Setsuna-mama, but the fight is over. She needs healed and . . . "<p>Before the argument could devolve further the trio heard another voice, a voice filled with anger and hate.<p>"Saotome Ranma, Prepare to die!"<p>Hotaru turned away from Pluto and back toward the meadow. She saw a young man carrying a big backpack. Even as he spoke he threw his gear to the ground and was advancing with the clear intent to hurt her mama.<p>"Mama!" Hotaru screamed, darting into the meadow.<p>Moving with a grace she normally didn't possess, Hotaru avoided Setsuna's lunging grab and ran to protect her mama.<p>"You leave my mama ALONE!" the purple eyed girl yelled.<p>Hotaru was breathing hard, gasping for breath but she managed to reach her mama before the dark haired warrior could.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ryouga dimly heard someone yelling at him, but he paid no mind to the words and advanced unheeding toward his redheaded foe. His focus was on the face of one Saotome Ranma. Anger filled his soul to overflowing, and poured out like water breaking though a levee.<p>"You've hurt Akane for the last time!" he thundered. "Now prepare to meet the Kami!"<p>His anger was so hot, so intense that Ryouga ignored the injuries that Ranma had sustained. While he was Ranma's enemy, he was in his own twisted way also Ranma's friend. Normally he wouldn't attack with this kind of advantage, but this wasn't normally. This time he was going to make Ranma pay. This time he was going to get revenge for the Hell that Ranma had put him through, and all the anguish he had caused Akane by leaving her.<p>Blinded by his rage Ryouga didn't see the slightly built girl running toward Ranma, nor did he hear her cry of anguish. His whole world was limited to one thing, Ranma standing there with a smirk on her face as she dropped into a defensive stance. He could see her lips move, but cared not for what she said. Ranma had disappeared three months ago, had vanished without a trace leaving the Tendo's and all the others with nothing other than a goodbye note. Leaving them wondering as to where he had gone . . . and if he would return.<p>Ryouga swung his battle umbrella certain that this time he would win. To his complete and utter horror, before the weapon could connect a pretty young girl with raven hair jumped between him and his target. The martial artist tried desperately to stop the blow, but knew that he wouldn't be able to . . . the best he could do was try to pull his swing and hope for the best.<p>His best wasn't quite good enough, and he heard the a sickening crunch of the impact an felt the girls ribs giving way to the blow. He saw the girl go flying away and tracked her with horrified eyes. He watched as she fell limply to the ground. To the lost boy's chagrin now he could hear, and what he heard was a cry of pain and agony. Ryouga turned preparing to run to the girls aid, when he heard something that froze him in his tracks.<p>"Ryouga, Prepare to DIE."<p>The words were literally hissed, the once familiar voice so cold that it crackled in the summer sun. When he turned back the Lost Boy saw a sight that he knew would haunt his dreams for the rest of his life . . . assuming he survived to lead that life.<p>Ranma's face was deathly pale, drained of all emotions, but her eyes were not. Her expressive sapphire eyes were as cold and hard as glacier ice and just about as forgiving.<p>"YOU . . . HURT . . . MY . . . DAUGHTER . . . "the words sounded as if they were pulled from very depths of Ranma's soul. "NOW . . . YOU . . . WILL . . . PAY."<p>Though delivered in a soft voice, Ryouga did not make the mistake of thinking they were an harmless. For perhaps the very first time Ryouga felt real fear when facing Ranma. This was the Ranma that had faced Saffron and won . . . this was a Ranma willing . . . nay eager to kill. If he had been asked before today if he would ever see Ranma in this state he would've said no . . . but now he knew, Saotome Ranma could only be pushed so far . . . and he had just crossed the line. He didn't understand what Ranma meant about hitting his daughter, the girl was to old to be Ranma's child, but Ryouga didn't think he was going to live long enough to find out just what Ranma did mean by his strange statement.<p>The last words Ryouga heard were ones he had spoken so often, and the last thing he saw before the blackness overtook him was the strident green light of a Perfect Shishi Hokoudan.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Oh SHIT!" Pluto screamed, "HOTARU!"<p>Setsuna watched helplessly as her daughter in all but name ran into the meadow, ran to protect her mother and was batted away as easily as a fly by the berserk martial artist. She didn't know why everyone was calling Michiru by the name of Ranma but right now she didn't care. Grabbing her henshin pen she transformed. If Hotaru was dead the boy was going to follow her . . . and follow her NOW!" There was no trace of the calm Pluto, no trace of the emotionless automaton that many believed her to be. For once in her long life emotions flowed from the woman like a flood, and like a flood they threatened to overwhelm all obstacles in her path<p>"Wait!" Chibi-Usa screamed grabbing Pluto before she could fire off a Dead Scream. "Hotaru will be okay! It's going to be OKAY! Don't kill him!"<p>The young senshi was fighting off tears of her own. She had known about the fight but hadn't known that it was going to be so brutal or that Hotaru was going to get hurt. She scowled as she thought about Pluto's last words to her. Pu-chan had known how bad it was going to be, and hadn't told her for fear that she'd interfere, she had made her promise not to interfere no matter what. Pu-chan had also made her promise not to let hew own past self go on the rampage either.<p>"LET ME GO!" Setsuna yelled back, all traces of the cold emotionless Pluto vanishing without a trace as she watched her family being attacked.<p>"NO, IT WILL BE OKAY." Usa refused to let go, she knew that Pluto had to be stopped from interfering or the timeline was going to be in big trouble.  "This has already happened for me and they will both be alright. We need to leave."<p>"LEAVE! You have got to be kidding. I'm not leaving." Setsuna snarled, looking at the neo princess with disbelief.<p>"You said you'd act this way," Usa tried to smile, though the expression was awfully weak. "Look at this."<p>Chibi-Usa handed a folded note to her mentor. Despite knowing that everything should turn out fine, she too was upset. If she had known a way to keep Hotaru from getting hurt she would have taken it.<p>Usa sighed with relief when Pluto finished reading the message to herself, though she took no enjoyment from the fear and frustration written large across her face.<p>"Fine," Pluto snapped, "But if they aren't back by morning I'm coming back up here and . . . "<p>"They will be Pu-chan, they will be,"<p>"But how, even if they transform those injuries won't be healed by tomorrow?"<p>"The Masaki's will take care of them Pu-chan, they'll be alright," Usa soothed, "They'll be alright. Now we've got to get out of here before they come looking for us. Its not time to meet them yet."<p>With a defeated sigh, Sailor Pluto grabbed Usa's hand and they vanished.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"How are they doing Washu?"<p>The self-proclaimed greatest scientist in the universe turned toward the soft hesitant voice.<p>"They'll ALL be fine," she stressed, "Tsunami stabilized them and we got them to my lab quickly enough that no permanent damage was done.<p>"Are you sure?"<p>"Yes, I am very sure they'll be fine . . . even Him," Washu pointed with disgust to the tube holding the young man who had attacked Michiru and the other girl after the fight with Happosai.<p>"I've reset Michiru's arm and leg, the healing tube will have her back in shape by morning. The other injuries were all much easier to deal with. The only real problem she has now is the amount of energy that she expended during the fight. She'll need to rest and eat quite a bit once she is released."<p>"What about the girl?" Ryoko asked.<p>"I said they'll all be fine," the red haired genius repeated with some exasperation.<p>"Now shoo on out of here. It will be hours before any of them wake up."<p>Washu herded the well-wishers out of her lab. Not even Nodoka was allowed to remain. It took some convincing to get her to leave her daughter, but Washu, with Katsuhito's help managed it. They promised her that if there were any changes Washu would know in plenty of time to get her back to the lab and that the sensors would let them know before any of the patients woke up. Nodoka would be able to be there when Michiru opened her eyes. Right now staying would do no one any good, and they all needed to get their minds on something else, anything else to take their minds off of the injured.<p>Humming to herself Washu turned back to her keyboard. These four were just soooo interesting. Especially Michiru and the other girl. There was something about them that sounded warning bells deep in the recesses of her mind. There was something more than just Michiru's sex, thought that in itself was interesting enough. The flame haired genius didn't know what had caused Ranma to become Michiru, but whatever it was had changed her down to the genetic level, had altered her very DNA. Washu knew that the primitives here on earth didn't possess the technology or know how to do it . . . so how had it happened. The girl was surrounded by several distinct energy fields, unrelated, yet somehow merging into a unified whole. The other girl had fewer such energy fields, but the ones she did have were even stronger than Michiru's. There was something about the girls that tugged at her subconscious. What it was she didn't know yet, but she was Washu, she would find out.
