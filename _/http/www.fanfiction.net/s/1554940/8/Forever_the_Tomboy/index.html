</div>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer<p>A/N – After getting the last two chapters out quickly this one took a little bit of time. Of course at 35 pages it is twice as long as all but the last two chapters. I hope you enjoy the small flashbacks and yet more hints of what is to come. Next time, more revelations and the fight with Happosai. Hope you like the twists revealed here.<p>A reviewer made a good point on the Tenchi continuity. For those that want to know this is (basically) the OAV setting – just tweaked a bit. I happen to like Kiyone so even though she comes from the Tenchi Universe setting (and a couple of the movies) I knew I was going to have her (at least a cameo) in the fic. So in hopes of preventing confusion there I used Achika for Tenchi's mother's name as it was used in one of the non-OAV settings for her name.<p>Forever the Tomboy Ch. 8 -<p>New Bonds Forged and Others Broken<p>"Beautiful," Ranma whispered softly and lovingly.<p>Ranma looked at the face just inches from her own and was content. Haruka looked so peaceful and serene while asleep, a far cry from the expressive visage she had when awake.<p>They lay on their bed, arms and legs still intertwined from a night of lovemaking. Ranma reveled in the feel of Haruka's arms holding her as she nestled even closer. They had fallen asleep while cuddling, coming down from a passion induced high that was like no other, and there was nothing Ranma enjoyed more than waking next to her tomboy . . . not even the Art meant more to her than Haruka.<p>Indeed, to her eyes Haruka looked more beautiful than ever. Never mind that her lover's blond hair was matted to her head in places, and in others the short hair splayed wildly in all directions as if an electric shock had been applied. Ranma smiled contentedly, it was definitely going to take a shower and a more than a few minutes with a brush to even think about getting that blond mop back under control. They both were covered with a thin sheen of dried sweat and were a bit fragrant, but not quite rank. Ranma smiled as she recalled just how they had worked up the sweat. Haruka had been very energetic last night. The smile turned sultry, a bit wicked, and if it were possible, grew even larger. She and Haruka were both quite limber and had made the most of their athleticism last night, to their mutual pleasure. It still amazed her from time to time, just how much she enjoyed making love with and to Haruka.<p>She had been almost completely ignorant about the physical aspects of love for a Long time. She had learned about it during her second life, but never actually experienced it herself. In her third, one thing was certain, the Panda hadn't ever given any instruction in this area. He had never had "the talk" with Ranma, nor even bothered to let him find out about it on his own. Genma had wanted nothing to distract his meal ticket from the Art, not friends . . . and definitely not lovers. The result, Ranma had no real contact with women, intimate or otherwise, on anything other than a superficial basis. Genma was a louse in many ways, but he had never cheated on Nodoka, so Ranma didn't even have a bad example to use as a comparison. As bad a Genma was in most areas of his life, even he had avoided the "professional women" when they were in the city. Not even the need to make Ranma a "Man among Men" had broken the panda's resolve to keep his son from any distraction offered by women . . . regardless of type.<p>Due to this lack Ranma had been completely ignorant about the physical aspects of love and nearly as ignorant of the emotional aspects as well. When the whole fiancée mess started Ranma had no idea how to handle the girls, especially when they were "demonstrative" of their affection. Hell, "he" hadn't even kissed a girl when he first arrived at the Tendo dojo, let alone done anything more serious. Unfortunately the same could also be said when he finally got sick of everything and left as well. Sure she'd been kissed, had experienced more than her share of glomps, hugs and (forced) kisses given to him by "his" various fiancées, but none of them had been consensual. To top it all off the ones he had experienced had been immediately followed by pain inflicted by one or more of the other "non-kissing" fiancées. Instead of true attempts to show love, each display of intimacy had been nothing more than an attempt to mark someone's territory, to show the other fiancées that he was "taken". They were not much different than the signs a predator would make when marking its territory. Even as clueless as he was he could sense the difference, the result being that he'd been more . . . uncomfortable than aroused by the attention.<p>She certainly wasn't uncomfortable with that now, at least not with Haruka . . . or at least not often anyway. Ranma snuggled closer to her love, taking comfort from her presence, her touch, and her scent. She inhaled, enjoying the traces of cologne, mixed with Haruka's womanly scent and the musk from their exertions the night before. It never ceased to amaze her how safe she felt when Haruka held her like this. She had the skills to more than take care of herself, but it was here that she truly felt protected.<p>The top of her head fit perfectly under Haruka's chin, their forms melded together as if they were made for each other, indeed in her mind they were.  With a tender smile, Ranma placed a rather wet kiss on her loves collarbone, smiling as her partner moaned softly in her sleep and unconsciously wriggled closer.<p>When she'd gone back to start her lives over, she'd resigned herself to being alone. Ranma had no interest in boys. The one thing that had scared her when she first thought about using the curse to escape her life in Nerima, indeed the only real fear she'd had, was the fear that she might "go girl" completely and fall for a boy. That thought had disgusted . . . and quite frankly terrified her.<p>Raising herself up onto her elbow, Ranma moved her right hand from its place on Haruka's waist to softly caress her lovers face and hair, content to enjoy the touch of skin on skin. Haruka shifted slightly under her ministrations rolling onto her back, her right arm slipping from its place around Ranma to fall by her side. Softly cupping Haruka's face with a gentle hand Ranma moved in for a kiss even as her mind fled back to her first meeting with Haruka.<p>It had been lunchtime at Mugen Academy. She had been sitting in her usual place under one of the cherry trees that dotted the campus with two of her friends from the orchestra. True they weren't close friends, but they were about as close to being her friends as she had at Mugen. "Michiru" didn't really have any close friends. Bitter experience had made her wary of bestowing that title lightly. Acquaintances she had in plenty, but true friends she could trust with her inner self, those were rare in the extreme.<p>Most of the other girls were to jealous of her grades, her looks or her other accomplishments to be "real" friends with her. One constant in all of her lives was her "trophy" status, people wanted to be seen with her to "look cool" take advantage of her status. Those that weren't jealous were often intimidated by her cool, reserved manner.<p>Ranma didn't let that bother her, the friends she did have in her life more than made up for this lack. Tendo Kasumi was her best friend growing up, she just hoped the same would be true when "Michiru" revealed her secret to Kasumi, and that time was rapidly approaching, it was only a couple of years away now.<p>True the oldest Tendo lived in Nerima so they didn't see each other every day, but they did talk on the phone almost daily, sent e-mails and got together as often as they could, if they were lucky several times in a week. She was good friends with Nabiki as well. This somewhat surprised her, but having a chance to meet the girl before she became the "Ice Queen or Furinkan" had allowed her to see an entirely difference side of the middle Tendo . . . a side she wished she had known about when she was still Ranma.<p>In fact the only one of the three Tendo's that "Michiru" wasn't close to was Akane. That was due more to a lack of interest on the part of the youngest Tendo than anything else. Akane knew Michiru was a scholar and musician, neither of which held any appeal for the youngest Tendo. Though she hadn't quite forgiven Akane, her frustration and anger had cooled to the point it no longer hurt quite so much.<p>Touching her lips once again to Haruka's in a gentle kiss, Ranma settled back in next to her lover, snuggling into her shoulder and pulling the arm back around her as her mind drifted back to that first meeting.<p>She'd been sitting under the tree when Haruka had walked by with three of his buddies. They'd been talking about some kind of car race, she heard the word NASCAR and Daytona. To be honest she hadn't known, nor really cared either about the conversation . . . or the boys. Her friends Ayano and Miki had been watching the trio approach and commenting on just how dreamy the boys were and what "manly" figures they cut in the school's uniform. Ranma remembered flinching at that last reference, still she hadn't been at all interested in the "view", nor had she looked up from her bento box. That is she hadn't looked up until she heard the shortest of the three boys whisper a challenge to the tall bishonen blond, a challenge to try his luck with the "Frost Maiden of Mugen Academy".<p>Ranma knew that some guys had taken her apparent lack of interest in boys as a challenge . . . and some of the girls had taken it as a warning and steered clear of her. Ranma snorted softly, a wry smile flickering across her face . . . as if she were going to force her attentions where they weren't wanted. Hell no! She's been on the receiving end of that to often herself to try it on someone else. Steeling herself for another unwanted pass, more corny pickup lines or bad poetry, and preparing to cut this guy off at the knees before putting him in his place, Ranma closed her bento then tied it shut<p>"Hello, I'm Haruka, Please ignore my idiot buddies, if you'd rather not talk to me that's okay." The voice was surprisingly light for a guy, but pleasant nonetheless.<p>Ranma felt her self shiver, for some reason the boy's voice had sent icy chills down her spine, yet those very chills weren't unpleasant . . . frightening yes, but they were far from unpleasant<p>"You had better . . . "Ranma began, with an icy snap to her voice, the words no warmer than the artic air at midnight.<p>The she had looked up, and she was lost. Something in the blond boy's eyes called to her. When their gazes met it was as if she had found something she needed desperately, but hadn't even known she was missing. She had stopped in mid-sentence and just stared  . . . and to her complete and utter horror he had done the same.<p>Something about the cocky boy drew her like a moth to a flame. Ranma had felt her pulse picking up and the beginnings of a blush heating her cheeks, only her iron will had kept her from blushing and giggling uncontrollably. It took all she had to just walk away . . . and even then she had turned to look back ... and been mortified to find that Haruka had been watching her with a strange, bemused look on his own face.<p>Ayano and Miki had teased her unmercifully the rest of the day. Her denials of interest brought her no relief, only more catty comments, more teasing. She had to admit, that even to herself, the denials sounded weak and unconvincing. Ranma tried her hardest to forget what had happened and to ignore Haruka whenever she saw him. Unfortunately the more she tried to forget him, the more he was on her mind. It was driving her insane. The thought of having sex with a boy nauseated her, but the thought of Haruka excited her like no other. Even her (now faded) memories of Akane and the other fiancées had never been quite this strong, only one other person had brought these feeling forth, and a relationship with her had been impossible before it could even start..<p>Haruka's reputation hadn't helped matters either. Ayano and Miki had culled the gossip about the blond boy the minute it looked like their friend Michiru might be interested in him. He was a strange mix, Haruka flirted a lot, but on the other hand he didn't actually date much. He was eagerly sought after by a whole horde of girls, yet didn't seem to let it go to his head, nor did he "kiss and tell." As much as Ranma tried to convince herself she wasn't interested . . . she was and her body knew it.  That both excited and made her uneasy, she felt betrayed by her body's reactions to this boy. Boys didn't interest her so why did her heart race so when the blond boy came around, why did she want to blush, why was she so damn flustered.<p>Then to make matters worse Haruka apparently had taken up the challenge. He sought her out daily, taking time to talk to her in the halls, to sit with her at lunch, most of all taking the time to get to know her, to make friends with her. This was something that none of the other boys who had asked her out had bothered to try. It was exhilarating and yet uncomfortable. By the time he was done, her emotions were in so much turmoil that it was "almost" a relief when Haruka finally asked her out.<p>Ranma continued to hug her lover as she thought back to her first date with Haruka, a rueful smile spreading across her lips. It had taken all the willpower she had possessed to say yes when Haruka finally asked her out, and even more to actually get ready for the date. It had taken her forever to get ready, she had agonized over what to wear, what kind of impression she wanted to make. Even today it seemed strange. "Ranko" never cared what she wore, but Michiru did.<p>He had come to her house, this house, the one that they now shared, to pick her up. Of course at that time she still had her nanny staying with her since she was only sixteen. Haruka had been so polite talking to Toyo.  Ranma would never forget the look in Haruka's eyes when "he" first saw her that night. His eyes had widened and his jaw dropped as he took his first look at her in something other than the Mugen Academy siefuku. She'd chosen a light blue silk shirt, with a matching knee length skirt, blue stockings and short-heeled pumps. She put on just a hint of make-up and had carefully chosen her jewelry, wearing dainty silver earrings that each held small sapphire chips in a diamond pattern, and a matching silver necklace with a small, but perfect, sapphire in a plain silver teardrop setting.<p>She'd told herself that if, by damn, she was going to date a boy that she'd go dressed to the nines. He'd been so cute too. He was wearing a green silk shirt of his own, with a jacket and matching khaki trousers. For some reason though Haruka had been as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs once they'd left the house. He didn't act at all like she had expected. They were supposed to go eat, then catch a movie. The meal was nice, they ate at a small family owned restaurant that was tiny and very cozy. During the meal talk was a little sparse as Ranma was nervous, extremely so, about dating a boy . . . and for some reason Haruka was just nervous. To kill the silence that was threatening the date, Ranma asked about Haruka's interests and before long was swamped in stories of his racing antics on the motocross circuit.<p>The movie was good too, but kinda depressing. Haruka allowed Ranma to pick the show and she decided on a martial arts movie. Unfortunately the hero had died a glorious but tragic death, honor upheld but at a great price.<p>Ranma grinned as she recalled the look of surprise and relief that had exploded on Haruka's face at her choice of shows. She had simply responded to Haruka's question regarding that choice by saying that she knew Haruka was into martial arts, and that she had studied some Kempo herself and thus had an interest as well..<p>During the movie Ranma had been a wreck. To her consternation she had actually hoped that Haruka would try to hold her hand or perhaps put his arm around her. To this day she couldn't recall much about the movie, she'd been so out of sorts that she had paid almost no attention to the show itself. To her surprise and some disappointment, Haruka had been a gentleman and hadn't tried anything. If it were not for his admiring reaction to her when she'd come downstairs, Ranma would've thought he didn't like her. Indeed as the movie progressed without any "moves" other than those on the big screen, she began to worry that he'd asked her out simply to prove that he could date the "undatable."<p>After the movie Ranma expected to head straight home, but Haruka had instead suggested a walk in the park. Ranma found herself agreeing to the excursion, curiously reluctant for the date to end. She had flinched momentarily when Haruka took her hand. Despite wanting Haruka to make such a show of affection she still had to fight the urge to deck him where he stood . She remembered running quickly through a calming mantra, desperately trying to calm herself and slow the hammering of her heart. The walk itself was awfully quiet and more than a bit uncomfortable for the two. Haruka had been strangely silent during the movie and the walk was no different, each silent step seemed louder than the one just before as the uneasy pair strolled through the park. Haruka had been quiet and during the short walk to the park, and more than a little fidgety as well.<p>The blond had taken her to a quiet area of the park, a secluded nook that took them out of sight from the other couples wandering the park. If she hadn't been so sure she could whip his butt if needed be Ranma might have been worried. Haruka wasn't acting like he was going to try anything improper, he was acting kinda nervous in fact, something that was at odds with his reputation.<p>Ranma smiled as she recalled what happened next, it had definitely caught her by surprise.<p>"Michiru," Haruka began nervously. "I really need to talk to you before we go any further on this date."<p>"What is it? You aren't mad at me are you?" Ranma looked up at the taller boy with wonder. What was going on? Was this some kind of prank, was he trying to ditch her now or something? Had he just asked her out so he could add another notch on his bedpost, one showing that HE could date the "Frost Maiden?"<p>The silence was unbearable to her as she waited for Haruka to continue. Dammit, she'd done something she had sworn never ever to do and agreed to date this guy and now he was going to dump her. Ranma felt both relief at the thought and a growing irritation as well, she was not going to take this lying down. She reached for the Soul of Ice and felt it's cold touch as the technique immediately respond to her need, so deep was she in the ice that she could see her breath steaming in the now cold air.<p>"No, but you might be mad at me," Haruka responded. He took a deep breath before continuing, "You see, I'm a girl. I like girls and I'm not attracted to boys at all. I've dated other girls and never told them, but somehow it doesn't seem right to do that to you."<p>Ranma was stunned, then she felt an overwhelming sense of relief. She didn't like boys. She didn't like boys . . . Haruka was a girl. Then she kicked herself for not seeing this sooner. You'd think with as many cross dressers as she'd known, with her experiences with Ukyo (and a few others in her old life), that she'd be able to tell when a girl was pretending to be a boy. Hell all the signs were there, no Adams apple, the heavy shirts or jackets worn at all times, even the voice was a slight give-away, it was deep for a woman, but awfully light for a guy.<p>Haruka waited for a response almost certain that this date was over. She'd dated other girls before, while pretending to be a guy, but for some reason that didn't feel . . . right . . . to do that to Michiru. From the very first time she's seen the aqua tressed girl sitting under that tree she'd felt a connection to the quiet and reserved girl, a connection far beyond anything she'd felt before. If she weren't so cynical, she'd say it had been love at first sight.<p>"I'm sorry, I'll take you home now," Haruka broke the silence.<p>Ranma heard the pain in Haruka's voice, and she knew she needed to say something, anything before it was to late, but was finding it difficult to speak. Her joy and finding out Haruka was a girl was overwhelming her thoughts.<p>"Don't leave," Ranma managed, "I'm glad . . . I mean I've never been . . . "Ranma paused, looking deep into Haruka's eyes. She wanted to be sure before she admitted her preferences, was she attracted to Haruka? It didn't take Long to decide, finding the answer in her heart was easy, so she continued. ". . . attracted to guys."<p>"Then why did you agree to go out with me? Did you know?" Haruka asked, puzzlement clear in her voice.<p>"Because," Ranma admitted sheepishly, "I'm attracted to you. I didn't know, consciously at least that you were a girl, and it's been scaring the hell out of me that I've been interested in you."<p>Haruka laughed to hear the mild curse uttered by the bewitchingly beautiful girl in front of her, a girl that wanted to go out with her. Hand in hand they walked back to Michiru's house, the date ending . . . but something else, something wonderful was just beginning.<p>Shaking her head to clear it, Ranma pulled her mind back to the present. She looked at her sleeping lover before she reluctantly disentangled herself from Haruka's grasp and rose to her feet. Her past with Haruka was something special, but she had much to do today. Today she was going to deal with Happosai, today she was going to regain the right to practice Anything Goes.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Haruka woke to four out of five of her favorite things in the world. She heard the sweet voice of her daughter as Hotaru called for her papa to wake up. Wafting all through the house she smelled the delicious scents of breakfast.<p>Taking a deep breath she sighed, "Michiru has outdone herself this morning."<p>In the background she heard violin music. Since she hadn't actually risen yet she didn't know if Michiru was playing the violin this morning or whether she had one of her CD's in the stereo. Either way the lyric strains sounded throughout the residence showcasing another of her lover's skills. Haruka loved listening to Michiru play. Somehow the smaller woman always managed to let her inner beauty flow out when she played, the emotions she normally kept tightly reined in sounded clearly with each crystal clear note. Haruka knew this was one of Michiru's greatest gifts. There were others who might be more technically perfect when they played, (though Haruka believed they were few in number) but the gift of expression, of letting their very souls sing with their music as they played, was one they lacked. You could feel the difference when they performed<p>Rising from her bed, Haruka stretched as she considered the fourth thing. She could almost feel Michiru's hands still upon her even though the other was not present. As tired as she might be, there was nothing that satisfied her need for companionship more than a night of passion with her lover. Last night had been passionate . . . and that in spades. Feeling sated, and a little tired, Haruka reached down and grabbed the first article of clothing she found and belted it on.<p>Rising Haruka wandered out of her room and toward the dining room. The first thing she was going to do was eat, then have her "talk" with Michiru, and finally get ready for school. It was Saturday, so she only had half a day's worth of classes to attend.<p>"Good morning papa," Hotaru chirped, still waiting by the door to make sure her Haruka-papa got up. The little warrior knew that her papa was awfully had to wake, many was the time she'd have to go get Michiru-mama to finally get her out of bed.<p>"Did you . . . Oh my." Hotaru stopped in mid sentence, blushing.<p>"What's wrong little one?" Haruka asked, still half asleep. She wouldn't really consider herself to be alive, let alone awake until after her second cup of caffeine. Coffee or tea it didn't matter to her just so Long as it was strong and hot.<p>"Uhmm, Nice robe papa," Hotaru's face had gone from slightly crimson to a full face, neck and shoulder blush, her pale skin now the crimson color of roses.<p>Hotaru turned away from her papa. While it was nice to see that she and mama were getting along despite all that had happened last night, there were some things that a young teenager did NOT want to know about her parents . . . even if they were adoptive parents and only a couple of years older than her.<p>Haruka paused, her mind still not firing on all cylinders, right now her mind was operating at about half-speed. Hotaru staring at her blushing, check. Quick tug at her waist to see if her robe was belted shut check. Take a closer look to see if she was wearing Michiru's robe, which was to small on her and didn't quite cover her bottom. Nope, it wasn't Michiru's robe. Take a still closer look at the robe . . . Oh, OH. Haruka felt her own face heat up as she realized that instead of her normal robe, she had grabbed the outer robe to her samurai outfit . . . making it more than clear to her daughter that her mama and papa had been playing games last night. The blush threatened to go nuclear as Haruka remembered the little role-playing session she had. Even as she blushed a wanton smile snaked across her face. She really did like playing the samurai-ko to Michiru's "maiden".<p>"Thanks Hotaru, Maybe I'll . . . "before she could finish she heard another all to chipper voice from another annoying and all to happy morning person.<p>"Hi Haruka," Haruka looked up to see the smiling face of Chibi-Usa, and the knowing smirk that somehow seemed out of place on her angelic visage.<p>"Be down in a minute," Haruka mumbled, darting back into her room. She emerged a few minutes later to the sounds of giggling from the future princess, a whispered comment followed by an indignant "Usa!" from her daughter, and immediately following, the sounds of fake retching from her daughter.<p>Gathering the shards of her dignity about her, Haruka stomped down the stairs to the dining room followed by a pair of giggling "angels". As expected the table was loaded with goodies, the smell of which could tempt a monk into breaking his fasting vow. Sitting at the table was a mostly alive Setsuna, apparently she's had her first cup of liquid life and looked like a terminally ill patient instead of a zombie . . . and next to her was a very chipper Michiru.<p>Breakfast was a happy affair as they all concentrated on the food. Eventually their appetites sated the family pushed their plates and bowls toward the center of the table. Haruka eyed her companion carefully and saw past the perky exterior and saw the same nervousness hidden in Michiru's eyes that she'd seen last night.<p>Taking a deep breath Haruka opened the conversation.<p>"Michiru, you said you'd talk to us this morning."<p>Michiru nodded pensively, then looked around the table. Taking a deep breath of her own she began.<p>"I've been hiding something from all of you," her voice was soft and determined as she spoke. "I've been hiding my fighting skills for a Long time."<p>"Why mama?" Hotaru interjected, traces of hurt showing in her voice and in her wounded eyes.<p>"Well, it's a Long story . . ." Michiru continued, ". . . but I'll give you the short version now. I've known Saotome Nodoka for many years now. We met in a park when I was around eight or so years old. She was sitting there watching the children play and looked really sad and very lonely. I wasn't old enough to know better so I walked over and sat down next to her and we talked for a while. She was really nice . . . and she was indeed very lonely. Her son Ranma had been taken on a training trip and she hadn't seen him since his father had taken him. By the time I met her it had already been over two years since she'd seen her son. We talked and then she played with me for a while before she had to leave. After that I'd look for her in the park and talk to her. Mother and Father were always gone so after a while I considered her to be like a second mother. At least she was around for me and always found time to talk or play with me."<p>The others were quick to note the undertones of anger Michiru unconsciously held in her voice as she described in a short sentence what it was like for her adoptive parents to be always gone. They listened intently as Michiru continued.<p>"I was already studying Kempo a bit and when I found out she was a swordswoman I begged her to teach me the art of the blade. Eventually she gave in. I later found out she had to get permission from her sensei to teach me as she uses the Masaki family style. It turns out that she her best friend when she was in school had been trained by her father, Masaki Katsuhito, and Achika talked her dad into teaching mama Long."<p>"Mama!" this time it was Haruka who interrupted, though she beat Chibi- Usa and Hotaru to the punch by the merest fraction of a second.<p>Michiru smiled uncertainly, then nodded. "We'd known each other for several months by then. I saw her several times a week and we'd grown very close." Michiru paused then added softly, "She was more like a parent to me than either Mother or Father by then. I'd seen more of her in those few months than I'd seen of them the entire year prior to that. I asked her if it was okay to call her mama."<p>Michiru's eyes grew moist and shined with unshed tears, "She just say there crying when I asked if she could be a second mama to me. I thought I'd done something wrong and was about to apologize when she grabbed me and just about hugged the life out of me. After that I started training with her, and boy was she a tough instructor. She made my Kempo sensei look like a sissy. We trained together for several years until she eventually said she'd taught me all she could. Mama Nodoka somehow talked her sensei into teaching me next. I studied with him for a couple of years."<p>"But why did you hide this." Setsuna already knew the answer, but also knew the others would want to know as well.<p>"Mother and Father were willing to let me study the sword, but they didn't want me to compete." Michiru answered. "So in order fight in tournaments used the name Azami and competed under that name. To make sure Mother and Father never found out I wore a wig and colored contacts. If they had found out they would've made me quit. By the time I was in High School, I'd been competing as Azami for several years. I couldn't just drop her and start over, there'd be to many questions, so I just kept using the alias."<p>"That still doesn't tell us why you hid it from us." Haruka prodded.<p>Michiru sighed again, "No it doesn't. Part of it was that it was fun to have a secret life." Michiru hedged. "I knew something that no-one else did. I just never thought it would get so out of hand."<p>Haruka nodded, though she wasn't convinced yet that this was the whole story. "So why didn't you tell us after we became Sailor Scouts?"<p>Michiru hesitated before answering as if she were weighing the words carefully.<p>"To be honest I didn't think it really mattered. I didn't have a sword for a focus and a regular blade won't do much damage to the things we fight. Besides, my sword skills don't help me use the mirror." Michiru finished wryly.<p>"But still you could've let me know, maybe trained me," Haruka interrupted again, frustration giving a shaper than intended edge to her words.<p>"No I couldn't," Michiru disagreed gently. "I had to promise Mama before I ever started training that I'd only teach my husband and children. Sensei Masaki made her so swear before he let her teach me, and I had to swear it to her on my honor. I thought that letting you know that I had these skills but couldn't share them would be worse than not telling you at all," Michiru finished guiltily.<p>Haruka nodded reluctantly. That matched what Michiru had told her last night and even made sense in a twisted sort of way. Michiru was wrong of course, but it did make sense . . . from a certain point of view.<p>"I'm hoping that now that maybe they'll let me teach you . . . if you want to learn." Michiru finished hopefully. "Given what we talked about last night anyway."<p>Lost in thought Haruka didn't answer and both Neptune and Uranus ignored the questioning looks from Saturn and Pluto and the smirk given by Chibi- Usa.<p>"At least I can still beat you hand to hand," Haruka quipped.<p>Still lost in her thoughts, and the hope that maybe she could learn the Misaki style the blond didn't catch Michiru's nearly, but not quite imperceptible flinch. Unfortunately for the aqua-tressed woman, the same could not be said for the rest of her audience.<p>Michiru calmed herself, plastering a serene look on her face.<p>"Looks like it's time for you to dress for school Love," Michiru prodded Haruka, "and the rest of you need to get ready as well."<p>"I'll drive you two to school," Haruka offered as she headed back upstairs.<p>"I'll take them where they need to go Haruka," Setsuna offered instead. "It won't be any trouble."<p>"Okay," Haruka agreed absently, "I'll see you all at the meeting at Rei's if not sooner."<p>Hotaru, Setsuna and Chibi-Usa nodded then the two girls darted past Haruka and up the stairs, they too had to get ready for their day . . . true, school wasn't part of their plan, but what Haruka didn't know about she couldn't question.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Girls, they've both left. Come downstairs so we can go," Setsuna yelled upstairs.<p>It hadn't taken the senshi of Pluto Long to dress. Instead of her usual business attire, she was dressed smartly, but comfortably clad in jeans and a light blouse, both of a rather dark green.<p>"Coming Setsuna-mama," Hotaru yelped her reply.<p>In just a few moments the three were gathered in the living room. Both of the girls were dressed casually as well, wearing jeans, light blouses and shod in tennis shoes. Hotaru was literally bouncing around the room as she tried to contain her excitement. She was gong to find out just what was going on with her other mama!<p>"Hotaru," Setsuna warned, "Remember your promise. Whatever we find out, whatever we see today you are NOT to interfere with it."<p>"I know Setsuna-mama,"<p>"The same goes for you Small Lady."<p>Setsuna fixed her red eyes on those of the future princess, bearing down on the chipper, smirking girl.<p>Chibi-Usa simply smiled, or rather grinned knowingly and agreed.<p>"Did you see mama flinch when papa said she could still beat her at hand to hand? I wonder what that was all about?" Hotaru mused.<p>"Hotaru, there is a lot about your mama that you don't know," Setsuna answered. "She's quite skilled at those arts as well. I don't know why she's been hiding her abilities, but we may find out today."<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"I've watched all of you in the past from time to time," the green-haired senshi answered. "Michiru is very skilled. She may well be as good unarmed as she is with the sword. But for some reason she's concealed those skills too."<p>Hotaru's eyes widened as she considered what her mama's words revealed, a feeling of numbed shock filling her with unease.<p>"But why," she breathed softly. "Why would she hide that too?"<p>Hotaru was confused to say the least. The last few days had been filled with surprise after surprise. It was discomforting, almost terrifying to find out that her mama was not who she thought she was. The young girl wondered just what else they'd discover today. Would her mama still be her mama when all was said and done? If there was one thing that she was frightened off, it was losing her family, losing the ones she had come to love as much if not more than her "real" parents. Hotaru took comfort in Usa's words from last night, the ones where Usa had said that mama and papa were still together in the future . . . but even so she was scared. She knew that the Crystal Tokyo Usa was from wasn't guaranteed, instead it was a matter of possibilities and if they were lucky probabilities, what it was not was a certainty.<p>"I don't know dear," Setsuna answered trying to comfort her young charge. "I do know that she loves us all very much, and that she's scared of losing us. That means she will do whatever it takes so that she doesn't lose us.  That is what I'm counting on. That is where my hope lies. Now before we leave I need both of you to use your henshin rod's powers to disguise yourself. We don't want Michiru or anyone else seeing us today, at least not until we're ready."<p>Hotaru nodded, as she and Chibi-Usa complied with Setsuna's directive. Then she and Usa took Pluto's hand as they prepared to leave the comforting surroundings of their home.<p>The teleport was slightly disorienting, as was usual, and the trio found themselves in an alley a short distance from their target. A short saunter later there were there. Setsuna pointed at a nearby house indicating their target.<p>"Make yourself comfortable girls. This is our first stop. We will wait here for now, so keep an eye on that house there," Pluto pointed at a modest house with a small dojo attached. Setsuna was as good as her word, settling down to wait for whatever would happen next. The others quickly followed suit, sitting comfortably on a nearby bench<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>The morning was crisp and cool, a lovely day in the mountains. The early morning sun bathed the area in a soft golden light. Birds darted from their nests and out into the cloudless blue expanse of the sky or darted about the thick grassy fields as they looked for their morning meal. Insects buzzed, chirped and otherwise sang their morning greeting as they hoped to avoid being that morning meal. All in all a rather tranquil and enjoyable morning in the country. Unfortunately the morning peace was soon broken by the sounds of violence.<p>"Ryoko! Prepare to die!" came the battle cry of a regal looking teen with Long lustrous purple hair as she called forth the power that was her heritage. Summoning what looked to be miniature logs, she gestured and had them surround her enemy. Once they were in place they launched a storm of electricity at her foe. The target blinked her amber eyes, then disappeared from sight before the attack could hit, only to reappear a short distance away.<p>"Missed me Princess. What's the matter afraid you might break a nail? Or do you need to find a servant to do the work for you?" her foe called out, laughter ringing clearly in her voice as she floated a few yards above the ground.<p>The two eyed women each other, their faces flushed with anger. One dressed in purple robes fit for royalty, the other in a simple striped housedress of blue and yellow. Both exhibited powers far from the norm as they squared off. Even their looks were unusual, the cyan hair and amber eyes of one, the purple hair and eyes for the other telling even the least observant of watchers that there were not "typical" Japanese schoolgirls.<p>Before the fight was could escalate further the feuding pair were interrupted by a gentle young voice piercing the morning air.<p>"Ryoko! Ayeka! Breakfast is ready everyone's at the table except for you two."<p>Once more glares were exchanged that would have melted the finest of alloyed steel and perhaps killed lesser beings. The pair then turned away from each other and with a snarl from Ryoko and a Harumph and frown from Ayeka they entered the nearby house. Once inside they were met by a blue haired pre-teen girl whose frown made both feel about as big as a mouse.<p>"Go. Sit. And don't cause any more trouble. Grandfather is having breakfast with us and he say's he's got an announcement to make." Sasami ordered.<p>Neither warrior could stand against the tiny girl as she stared them down, tapping one foot impatiently and shaking a wooden spoon at them as if to punctuate "the talk" she was giving them.<p>"Yes Sasami," they chorused, then huffed again favoring each other with yet another fiery glare.<p>The Masaki house was full as the "family" gathered around the table. The patriarch, Masaki Katsuhito presided with an ease his grandson could only envy. Mihoshi and Kiyone of the Galaxy Police sat in their usual places, once again forced to move back after losing another apartment. The red- haired Washu made a few last keystrokes on the holographic keyboard in front of her before it disappeared and she took up her chopsticks instead. Ryoko settled in on the right side of one Masaki Tenchi, while Ayeka took the left and both wilting visibly at the stern gaze given to them by Katsuhito.<p>Everyone's attention turned to the veritable feast that lay before them, to busy eating for much conversation outside of an occasional request in the nature of "pass the rice please" or "hey give me some more of that" the manner of the request depending greatly on who was asking. Eventually though even the hungriest of appetites can be sated, and eventually they were done.<p>Katsuhito smiled mischievously, though the smile was only in his eyes and didn't grace his lips. Normally the very picture of a venerable priest, at times he let his prankster nature loose and this morning was one of those times.<p>"Tenchi."<p>"Yes grandfather."<p>"I would like you to stay home from school today."<p>Tenchi looked up at his grandfather, trying to discern why this rather strange request was being made. It wasn't that he minded staying home. It was rather that when his grandfather did something unexpectedly Tenchi was in for a surprise, and not all of them had proven to be pleasant.<p>"But why grandfather?" Tenchi's puzzled look carried over to his voice, punctuating the question asked with his tone.<p>"We are going to have company today."<p>"Who is it. Could it be that father or one of our mothers coming today?" Ayeka asked. She hadn't heard of any visit being scheduled, but who else could be coming that would require Tenchi to stay home. Not that she minded the thought of spending more time with her Tenchi, no she didn't mind that at all.<p>"No Ayeka it isn't them. Two students of mine are coming later today."<p>Katsuhito began laying his trap very carefully.<p>"But why would Tenchi want to hang around while you visit with a couple of old dried up priests?"<p>This time it was Ryoko asking the question.<p>The priest gave one of his maddening smiles as he watched Tenchi working the problem through. He began counting down, 5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . Before he reached one Katsuhito saw the light coming on in Tenchi's face.<p>"Mi-chan is coming? Wow, I haven't seen her . . . "<p>Tenchi swore he could see his breath in the air before him as he stopped in mid-sentence, it was as if an polar wind had suddenly blown through the house. The young prince shot a laser edged glare at his grandfather before looking cautiously to his left. Ayeka's face was a mask . . . a very, very  scary emotionless mask. Gulping Tenchi looked to his right, Ryoko's mask wasn't emotionless, but was just as scary. The former space pirate was definitely on the edge of being very pissed off.<p>Two girls, both hundreds of years old, both aliens, both possessing powers that few humans could withstand, both used to getting their way and right now both were focused on one human/jurian hybrid, one Misaki Tenchi. The pair were sometimes enemies and sometimes friends but one thing could unite the two most forward of Tenchi's suitors . . . a potential rival and right now they were they ever united.<p>"Lord Tenchi," caroled Ayeka, "Who is Mi-chan?"<p>"Yeah Tenchi," Ryoko echoed in refrain, "Who IS Mi-chan?"<p>Tenchi gulped and prayed, he just hoped Tsunami was listening as he opened his mouth.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma bounced down the sidewalk toward her mama's house. She appeared oblivious to her surroundings so deep in thought was the young woman. In her case not only were appearances deceiving they were dead wrong. Even as lost in her own thoughts as she was, her ki senses flowed around her ever alert for an attack.<p>"I hate shading the truth with my family," Ranma mused, "But I don't know how they would handle the truth." A smile lit her face as she considered the evening just past. Despite what Haruka had found out, her love had not turned her away, instead she had reaffirmed their love. Ranma hoped the Haruka would feel the same when the latest secrets were revealed, she knew that she couldn't stand to lose them . . .any of them.<p>What she'd told Haruka was the truth, just not all of it. She had met her mother in the park just as she'd said.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * Flashback<p>"I love coming to the part Toyo," chibi-Ranma/Michiru looked up at her companion with a pixie grin on her face.<p>Her nanny looked down indulgently. Matsurugi Toyo had been hired by the Kaiou's shortly after they adopted Michiru. A tall woman with classic looks and restrained mannerisms she'd been just what they'd been looking for. Someone who would teach the rather tomboyish daughter they'd adopted to be a lady, to be a credit to her new Clan. Toyo knew that Michiru had been adopted as a showpiece, and it cut her to the quick to know that. The Kaiou's had wanted a child to show off, and wanted one that might have some gagin blood in her to show just how progressive they were . . . and to help with their American contacts. Little Michiru had seemed to fit the bill perfectly. Michiru's features were Japanese through and through, but her fiery hair was not. In their eyes she combined the best of both worlds. If they wanted they could die her hair and she'd look Japanese, or leave it as it was and look like the progressives they claimed to be.<p>However, when she'd been hired she'd also been told to "train little Michiru up right." A task that at times seemed impossible. A true professional though she'd risen to the challenge, and despite an occasional stubborn refusal to cooperate, Michiru seemed determined to help . . . at least with most things.<p>Toyo shook her head, it was almost scary at times just how quickly the girl learned, and it didn't seem to matter what was being taught. When Michiru wanted to learn nothing could stop her it seemed.<p>There were times though when Toyo saw something deep in her charge's eyes that made her seem much older than the eight years she actually was. Toyo had learned quickly to make compromises, and to help her ward conceal the parts of her that her parents disapproved of so Long as those parts weren't dangerous or to improper.<p>Toyo still remembered catching her charge practicing her Art. She'd only been with the Kaiou's a few months then. She'd woke and decided to see if Michiru was up, only to find the girl's bed empty. Frantic, she'd searched the house from top to bottom, only to find Michiru in the garage doing katas, katas that should've been far beyond the skills of anyone so young. When she'd asked Michiru about it, the rascal had simply grinned up at her with that sly smile she was so good at producing and told her that her father had started training her as soon as she could walk. The smile had quickly faded. Toyo assumed that the girl was thinking about the accident that had killed her parents and had let the matter drop.<p>Not long after that Michiru had been particularly resistant to an etiquette lesson she was trying to get across. Sudden inspiration hit and Toyo decided to cut a deal with the child. She'd not only allow Michiru to continue her study of the Art, she'd help arrange sensei to teach her, in return Michiru had to agree to cooperate with her other lessons, ALL of her other lessons. It had been relatively easy to talk the Kaiou's into agreeing to let Michiru train. She'd simply emphasized the need for physical exercise and stressed as well the discipline and confidence that training in the traditional Japanese martial arts would give their daughter.<p>Toyo shook her head as she though about just how far Michiru had taken that training. Every sensei had been amazed as she took to the training like a duck to water. Michiru was amazing, more than one had called her a prodigy. She was already a second dan black belt in Kempo and she had kept up her end of the bargain and poured herself into her other lessons just as intently. Michiru's skill with the violin still amazed the nanny.<p>"Can I go play now Toyo?" Michiru pulled impatiently at her nanny's hand.<p>"Yes dear, I'll sit here and watch."<p>Ranma quickly ran off to play. She hadn't been playing Long though when she spotted someone sitting alone on a bench. The woman sat quietly doing nothing more than watching the children play, a wistful look etched on her face. It took a few moments, and then recognition hit her. That was Saotome Nodoka sitting there. Despite her resolve to the contrary, Ranma felt her heart going out to her mama.<p>Darting over she stopped in front of the sad looking woman.<p>"Hi, I'm Kaiou Michiru." Ranma put on her cutest smile.<p>Her heart leaped when an answering smile crept across her mama's face.<p>"Saotome Nodoka," came the warm reply. "I'm pleased to meet you."<p>Ranma vowed then to be part of her mama's life. She might only be able to do so as Michiru, but she'd do her best to make sure her mama wasn't alone for the next ten years. Still, she had a part to play. She might never be able to let Nodoka know just who she was, but she could still bring some light to her mama's life.<p>"Are you here by yourself?" Ranma asked innocently.<p>A cloud flickered across Nodoka's face.<p>"Yes I am child."<p>"Would you play with me?"<p>Before the older woman could reply she was interrupted.<p>"Michiru, what have I told you about bothering people?" a stern voice asked.<p>Ranma looked up at her nanny.<p>"But Toyo, I wasn't bothering her, I was just talking to her," Ranma put on her most innocent expression.<p>"Now Michiru, I heard you ask her to play with you," came the firm rejoinder.<p>"It's alright," Nodoka interrupted the scolding, "She wasn't bothering me. Is she your daughter?"<p>Toyo shook her head, "No, I'm her nanny. Her parents are away most of the time and they hired me to look after the little scamp."<p>"Oh," Nodoka paused consideringly, "Would it be okay for me to play with her? My son is gone on a trip with his father and . . . "<p>"Well," Toyo took her time answering. The woman in front of her was well dressed and seemed nice. "If you don't mind I don't. I'll just sit here and watch."<p>Ranma's smile was blinding as she grabbed her mama's hand and led her to the swings.<p>The afternoon passed quickly for the pair and all to soon it ended.<p>"Michiru, it's time to go," Toyo's voice interrupted the pair.<p>Nodoka stopped the swing regretfully and let the child down. Ranma was sure that the smile on her face went from ear to ear. She'd had so much fun, and she'd never really seen this side of her mama before.<p>"It looks like I've got to go," Ranma paused considering her words. "We come here almost every day, will you come and play with me some more?"<p>Nodoka felt her heart fly into her throat at the question. She looked down at the elfin girl and nodded. It had felt so good to have a child again, even if it were someone else's and even if it was only for a little while.<p>The next few months followed that pattern. The trio would meet at the part and Michiru would play. Sometimes with just Nodoka, sometimes with both. Ranma had seldom been so happy.<p>Toyo and Nodoka became quite good friends, and when Nodoka's skill with the sword came to light it seemed only natural for Toyo to suggest that Nodoka teach it to Michiru. It had taken a bit of work . . . and Nodoka getting permission from her sensei, but it had been worth it. The Art of the Sword had drawn the two even closer as they shared a passion that was all but incomprehensible to one who did not share it.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma's shook her head, smiling at the warm memories. The training had brought them closer together and sealed the bond that had begun with a simple afternoon of play. She still remembered the day she had slipped and called Nodoka mama, she'd been about twelve at the time, (subjectively at least).<p>The older woman had frozen in mid-kata then stopped the lesson. The swordswoman looked at her with a mixed smile and frown before asking why . . . why she had called her that. Ranma shuddered, that had been close, she'd managed to avoid lying by simply giving her mama her best killer smile and telling her (some) of the truth. She'd told Nodoka that she loved her and that she was like a second mama to her.<p>The full truth would've been harsher, and something that Nodoka would've been honor bound to stop. If she had told the full truth, that she considered Nodoka more her mama than the woman who had adopted her it would've been . . . bad. To this day Ranma was sure that having lost her own son for so Long Nodoka would've felt compelled to end their relationship. Would've tried to stop the growing bond they shared so that the relationship between the her adoptive parents and "Michiru" could be repaired.<p>If the truth were to be told, Ranma considered her adoptive mother to be just that. A woman who was bound to her by law and obligation, the same for her father. To this day the more formal words were all she could find in her heart to describe them. What hurt was that they never seemed to even notice the distance between themselves and Michiru, so Long as she was their "dutiful daughter".<p>Ranma respected their talents and appreciated them taking her in, but they were gone so often that a true bond had never formed. No, what she felt for them was respect, an honor debt that she would try her best to repay, accordingly they were mother and father. What she felt for Nodoka was all the love from her life as "Ranma/Ranko" taken to a much higher power. Nodoka was her mama, and with that word went all the emotions that it carried. The bond she had formed with Nodoka was one of love, pure and true, sullied only by her resolution not to tell her mama just who she was. That resolution had eventually fallen, and despite her fears no harm had come from finally telling her mama the truth.<p>Still smiling Ranma brought her mind back to the present. She knew that she should be concentrating on what was yet to come today instead of what she might have to face later. She would eventually have to deal with her family and the other Senshi but that was later. Right now she needed to stop reminiscing about the past and concentrate on the now.<p>Be that as it may, she was finding it difficult not dwell on her original plans, their demise, and to recall just how she got into the predicament that she found herself in today. As important as her appointment with Happosai was, she couldn't force her mind away from her family.<p>"It's like I've built a house of cards," she mused, "It looks sturdy enough, but remove one card and the whole thing may come tumbling down." The thought was depressing  . . . and downright frightening. She had worked so hard to build her new life, and she could lose it all if things didn't play out right.<p>Ranma knew that part of the reason she'd been so successful in hiding her past was that no one had been looking for the truth. It had all seemed so easy when she had first come up with her plan, after all who believed in time-travel. No one that she knew of, other than those with first hand knowledge of the Nanban Mirror, would even suspect it was possible to travel in time.<p>Ranma had made his/her plans carefully. Lock her curse so that even if she were found out there was no way for her to honor the various engagements. Start over so she could learn what life was really all about. Even then Ranma had known there was more to life than martial arts. He just hadn't known how to go about finding out what that was or how to learn the life skills he needed. He'd never had the free time to do anything about it or to even try to learn them. The fiancée mess had seen to that. Just how was he to protect everyone's honor, how was he to "choose".<p>It sounded so easy when the others said it. "Just choose," they'd say. Yeah right. If he chose Akane, then Shampoo was going to be dishonored and face an even more drastic punishment than her curse. Ukyo was in the same boat. She either had to marry or kill him to regain her own honor, and if he picked either of them then Akane's honor was tarnished.<p>Ranma absently kicked a rock as she walked. No, the only way out she'd been able to come up with she'd taken. It hadn't been an easy choice, actually it was born out of desperation. He'd spent nearly two years in Nerima trying to find an honorable way out of his predicament and had failed. "The Plan" had seemed like the only way out. Now, because she'd gotten a bit complacent and because she'd wanted to have a child of her own she was risking it all.<p>"Of course it couldn't turn out to be as easy as I'd planned," this time a rueful grin spread across her face, making her appear even cuter than usual. "First the Musk got me at Jusenko . . . then when I got that taken care of, and actually got my plan back on track what happens? Could I be granted the opportunity to just live a normal life as Michiru? Hell no. I can't just be her, live to the present and face Happosai to take back my right to practice Anything Goes."<p>Ranma shook her head disgustedly, "Of course it hadn't worked out that easily. I'd originally intended to do just that. I didn't have any really close friends who'd know any different. Hell even if they found out about my skills I could just say my sensei forbade using them for show, that they were only for defense. That's a common thread after all of real martial artists. But no, I had to be "awakened". Instead, two years or so before my meeting with Happosai, two years before today, I find out I'm a Magical Girl, the Princess of Neptune no less."<p>Instead of regaining her Art and moving on like she'd originally planned, now she had obligations, obligations that far outweighed her desire to hide her past. Sailor Neptune had a job to do and friends to help, and if she didn't do her job innocents would suffer.<p>One thing hadn't changed in any of her lives. Saotome Ranma never abandoned a friend in need, never refused to help when she could. She also had her duty to her Princess, and duty tied her with bonds just as strong as those of her friendship with the other girls. Unfortunately with these ties came another problem. If everything did come to light what were they going to think of her? Could they accept her past? She'd fought the idea of being a senshi. Then when she had to surrender that fight, she had to try and find a way to explain her skills in the Art once she'd regained her right to it.<p>Her first, (and current) plan was to claim they were part of Neptune that she'd just begun to recall, at least as far as the hand to hand skills were concerned. Unfortunately Pluto and Saturn might be able to put a kibosh to that idea. Ranma didn't know how skilled she'd been in her prior life, but they would know. She'd just have to be careful. Right now all she could do was move on, move up and hope for the best. Still, she knew that it was going to take a lot of talking to get herself out of the hole that she'd dug herself into. Ranma did not look forward to explaining why she'd never been able to use the Art to help her friends when she had the skills. She was more than a little afraid that the truth, her oath with Happosai would do little to assuage their anger.<p>Ranma snorted wryly, "Can you believe it. Saotome Ranma is a magical girl.  Probably supposed to have been born a girl in the first place. Kami must have a really strange sense of humor. I just hope I can keep things under control. If I'm not really careful all my secrets are going to be coming out of the closet."<p>Ranma ignored the stares she was getting from the guys she passed. Oh, she took more than a little pride in her looks, but despite accepting her "destiny" despite being completely comfortable with being a girl she still did not like boys.<p>"Damn I hated the curse. I only accepted it because it looked like the only way out."<p>Almost despite herself the grin widened. "It's been worth it though. I love Haruka, that tomboy's been the best thing to ever happen to me and if I wasn't a girl she'd never have fallen for me."<p>A pang of sadness flickered though her heart and across her face as she recalled the only other woman she'd loved with that kind of intensity. A woman she'd been forced to leave so many years ago. Shaking her head Ranma told herself once again that she'd had no choice, that it wouldn't have worked out anyway. The past had already been written, and she written out of it. If she had changed the past, if it were possible, how would the present/future changed. Still, as much as she loved Haruka, as much as she knew Haruka was her soul mate, part of her still wondered if things could've been different with her.<p>"Doesn't matter anyway," she told herself unconvincingly. "I don't think she loved me that way anyhow."<p>Ranma conveniently forgot to remember the oath her "sister" had wanted them to take. The oath to be "sworn sisters" and to share their lives. During her first "new life" Ranma had learned a lot, but even at the end she wasn't that perceptive about her own relationships. Sure she had gotten better at spotting attraction when it involved someone else . . . but not when she was the object of affection.<p>Returning to her brooding, Ranma continued to walk toward her mama Nodoka's house. "I should've just told Haruka that we could get an anonymous donor, but noooo I didn't want to lie to her . . . and still don't" Ranma admitted hesitantly to herself. What am I going to do when she asks more questions?"<p>The blue-eyed girl was dreading the time when Haruka would find out about her true skills in the Art. Truth be told, Ranma was more powerful now than she'd ever been. She certainly wasn't invincible, but she was undoubtedly tough. She'd find out how tough later today. Ranma smirked Happosai was in for a surprise. Still, as she'd just admitted she wasn't quite the best. Sensei Masaki could probably still wipe the floor with her if he tried.<p>Of course she'd not had the "power up" that being Sailor Neptune brought, but she still wasn't sure she could handle him even with that factor added in, Sensei was just to skilled. As Sailor Neptune she was Ranma squared, or maybe even cubed, but Masaki Katsuhito was amazingly good, both with and without the blade he favored.<p>No doubt Mercury could calculate the difference in power levels between "Michiru" and "Neptune" but Ranma didn't really care to hear just what the multiplier was, she just knew she was "supercharged" as a Sailor. She knew only to well that even that didn't mean she was invulnerable, (she could and had been hurt while Neptune as more than one encounter with the Negaverse had proven) but it did mean she was much more capable than before.<p>It had been difficult to hide her activities from everyone, but she'd never given up training, not in her past life, and not as Michiru. Her ki control now would've amazed the "old" Ranma, and her ability in the Art's physical aspects hadn't been allowed to languish either.<p>Ranma knew she could lie, and quite well, she was no longer "cursed' with the "old Ranma's" inability to tell any kind of believable lie. She could and would lie in a good cause, but hiding things from her family didn't meet this definition in her own mind. No, she'd have to do what she could and hope for the best.<p>Ranma was still lost in her thoughts when she discovered that she'd stopped walking. She blinked her sapphire eyes and looked up to find that she was standing outside her mama's house. Ranma shook her head and entered, paying no attention to the "mother" and her two "daughters" taking a break on a nearby bench. Instead she opened the gate to her mama's house and entered. It was time to focus on what was now and what was yet to come today.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Michiru, It's so good to see you,"<p>Saotome Nodoka looked down at the daughter she had, yet didn't. Michiru had been her "daughter" in all but name for many years now and the elder woman had loved her as if she were her own even before she knew the truth. Then she found out that Michiru was her daughter . . . errr son Ranma, his/her curse permanently locked. The taller woman shook her head ruefully. If it hadn't been for the unbelievable weirdness that she'd already seen surrounding her son like a dark cloud she never would have believed it She still remembered the day Michiru revealed the truth. The girl had appeared at her house for one of her periodic visits, but had shown signs of extreme nervousness. When Michiru revealed the truth her first response was uncharacteristic of her, she had fainted. When she woke Michiru had told her the entire, impossible story. With the proof Michiru had given she was unable to dispute the tale. Finally, after so many years alone her child was back in her life and it turned out that she had been "back" for years. The only fly in the ointment was that she had to drop her secret dream of marrying Ranma to her young student.<p>"Hi mama," Michiru returned the greeting, then still on the doorstep pulled her mama into a tight hug. "Today is the day."<p>"Yes it is Michiru. Come in, everything is already set up for you."<p>Nodoka led her daughter into the kitchen and began the process of turning Michiru back into Ranma-chan.<p>"Do you think you are ready dear?" Nodoka asked as she began shampooing the Long blue hair that was Michiru's trademark.<p>"I think so mama," Michiru purred, basking in the simple pleasure of having someone else take care of her blue mop. "I've been waiting a very Long time for this."<p>"Yes you have. I hope it goes well," Nodoka shuddered as she considered the train wreck that had been her daughter's life.<p>It still surprised her that Ranma/Michiru had turned out as well as she did. Her life had been difficult and she might just have as easily shattered under the strain. Not only had things been hard as "Ranma" but it couldn't have been easy to accept, nay embrace the curse the way that Michiru had been forced to do. Lesser mortals had lost their sanity under conditions less extreme. If she ever had doubts about Ranma's worthiness they had vanished when Nodoka realized the lengths Ranma had went to in order to salvage everyone's honor.<p>The two made small talk while Nodoka worked. The shampoo was followed by a rinse, then the dye. Shortly thereafter Michiru regained the fiery locks that had been "Ranko's" Nodoka knew that Michiru had changed its color years ago to prevent recognition by the Nerima Wrecking Crew and friends. Michiru had made the change about three years before "Ranma" was due to arrive. The elder Saotome still smiled when she recalled the shocked look she'd had when she first saw the "new look" Michiru had adopted when she chose the aqua color for her hair.<p>Nodoka now knew the reason for the change was so that even her friends would no longer comment about the change, nor would her mama when "Ranko" arrived.. With Ryouga's wandering ways you never knew when or where he'd show up . . . other than it was usually at the worst possible time for Ranma, hence the very early change in hue.<p>Nodoka looked at the transformed girl and shook her head. Even when Ranma had been pretending to be "Ranko" they had received many comments about how they looked alike. Now that Michiru was eighteen and had physically matured the resemblance was more than remarkable, it was striking. The young woman sitting in front of her was her mirror image, a younger image true, but still nearly identical in her appearance, only the eyes and hairstyle were different.<p>Chuckling softly, Nodoka looked with loving eyes at her daughter. Her only regret now, after having grown so close to Michiru, was that they were no longer legally "family". Nodoka knew however that however the "law" and "society" saw them, they were family. They were joined by blood and love . . . and nothing could change that.<p>"Let's go upstairs and get you changed," Nodoka prodded. "We have to catch the train in twenty minutes."<p>Ranma took a final look in the mirror seeing once again the fiery tresses that she had hated for so Long. It had taken her years to fully accept her choice. Yes, she had made the decision to "live" as a girl, but she had done so only grudgingly at first. Now she wouldn't change back even if she could.<p>They were walking through the living room when Nodoka felt Michiru stopping behind her.<p>"Mama. What are these?"<p>Nodoka froze, then turned, her heart dropping at her feet. Had she forgotten to put those blasted papers up? Finishing her turn the samurai- ko stopped dead in her tracks and softly curses under her breath. She had forgotten them.<p>"Uhmm Michiru," Nodoka sighed. "I guess I ought to tell you. I was going to wait until tonight since you have so much going on today, but I guess the Kami's decided you should know about my secret now instead of later."<p>"What is it mama?"<p>"As of this morning I am no longer Saotome Nodoka."<p>"What?" Nodoka heard the younger woman's voice rise in shock.<p>"I divorced your Genma. The paperwork came this morning," Nodoka answered.<p>Though outwardly calm, she knew that she should have waited. While she was confident in Michiru/Ranma's skills, Happosai was no pushover. Michiru needed to be at the top of her game and not worrying about other things. True after Saffron it was clear that Michiru had the raw power to defeat the Grandmaster of Anything Goes, but this was a martial arts duel. No killing attacks were allowed, and quite frankly some of Michiru's abilities with ki were deadly if handled wrong or with an unsettled spirit.<p>Nodoka looked into the sapphire eyes of her daughter. At first she saw confusion, then they cleared and her daughter smiled up at her.<p>"Good for you mama. You are young and pretty, you should look for someone who would be worthy of your love."<p>This caught Nodoka by surprise. "I'm not to sure about that dear."<p>"I'm sure mama." Michiru answered softly, then continued with a roguish grin, "You look like me and I'm gorgeous."<p>Despite herself, Nodoka could feel an answering grin spread across her face. The words from her daughter felt so good to hear. Even though she could see the laughter in Michiru's face and voice, the words themselves were true, and after so Long a time alone the thought of finding a man she could love and trust was tempting. After all, Michiru was a striking young woman, and they did look much alike. Unfortunately, Michiru didn't drop the conversation there but pressed on.<p>"Mama, If you aren't a Saotome then what is your name?"<p>Nodoka steeled herself as she answered. Michiru wasn't going to like this one bit.<p>"I'm ronin dear. My family disowned me when I married Genma. Mother and Father have passed on, and my brother Nagoya refuses to talk to me."<p>Nodoka hurried to continue, seeing the stubborn, and more than a little angry, look in Michiru's eyes. "Don't worry about me dear. I'd rather be ronin than married to that man anymore." With a sudden shift of topics Nodoka continued, "Did you know that neither he nor Tendo Soun have bothered to tell me that Ranma's been missing for months? Every time I go over it's the same. "You just missed him Nodoka," or "He's on a training trip Nodoka,"<p>"Don't be sad dear. I'm more relieved than anything," Nodoka finished as they walked into Ranma's room. There on the bed was one of "Ranma's" trademark Chinese outfits. The only change was the substitution of panties for boxers and the addition of a sports bra to the mix.<p>Michiru paused, partially disrobed and looked at her mama. Nodoka could see the twinkle in her eyes, it was as if the girl was planning to get revenge for something . . . good-natured revenge, but revenge just the same.<p>"You know mama, Masaki sensei is a fine figure of a man for an older gentleman."<p>"Michiru! He's old enough to be my father. In fact he was my best friend Achika's father."<p>"That just makes him mature mama," Michiru fired back, humor evident in her voice. "But if you don't like him, Ten-chan's father has been a widow for a Long time . . . and you know he's a "manly man."<p>Nodoka tried her best to frown at her daughter but the expression went for naught as she dissolved into laughter. What Michiru didn't know was that her first crush was Masaki Katsuhito and even given the age difference if she thought there was a real possibility . . . . Nodoka pointed her finger at her daughter. "Now behave young woman. Finish dressing and then we need to go. I told sensei we'd be there early to visit a while before the duel, and I'm sure you'd like to spend some time with Tenchi . . . .he's such a nice young man." This time it was Nodoka gently teasing her daughter.<p>"Mama! You know I've got a girlfriend, why would I want to chase Tenchi. Even if I have to admit that if I liked boys Tenchi would be a good catch."<p>Nodoka sighed, "I know dear, but I wish . . . "<p>"Wish what mama?"<p>"Nothing dear."<p>"It's not nothing mama, what is it?" Michiru pressed.<p>Nodoka shook her head sadly, "I just sometimes wish for grandchildren."<p>"Mama?"<p>"Yes dear."<p>"When this is over today, however it turns out, would you . . . would you like to meet Haruka, Hotaru and Setsuna?"<p>Nodoka felt her heart leap at her daughter's words. Michiru's words were soft, hesitant and laced with more than a little trepidation, but they were words that the elder woman had wanted to hear for so Long. Even before she found out Michiru was her daughter Ranma, she had been a little hurt that the younger woman didn't invite her family over to visit. They shared so much that it had felt . . . odd, to be excluded from this facet of Michiru's life, odd and somehow wrong. Michiru had talked about her "family," oh how she had talked, but not once had Michiru responded to hints that Nodoka wanted to meet them.<p>Once she had found out Michiru's secret, the omission had become tolerable, though never enjoyed. Now it seemed that her daughter in all but name wanted her to truly become part of her new family. The smile that blossomed on Nodoka's face was as welcome as the sun after a Long cold night, and twice as bright.<p>"Nothing would make me happier dear. I've wanted to meet them for a Long time."<p>"I know mama, but I wasn't sure how to set it up," Michiru paused, "Mama, they still don't know everything . . . I mean . . . "<p>"Daughter, you really need to tell them. Secrets can be like deep wounds, if they aren't exposed and cleaned they'll only fester and grow worse."<p>Nodoka heard her daughter sigh. "I know mama, but I'm afraid. What if I lose them?"<p>"If they love you they'll stay with you," Nodoka paused to collect her own thoughts. "I'm not saying that it won't be rough. You may have to work really hard at rebuilding the trust you have with them, but . . . "a grin spread across her serene face, "Kaiou Michiru never loses."<p>Nodoka's sally was rewarded with the bell-like tinkling of her daughter's laughter.<p>Yes mama," Michiru answered, the impish grin never leaving her face, as she pondered the possibilities as well. "Uh, mama," she continued hesitantly. "What would you say if I told you Haruka and I were thinking of having a baby. I uh, well I . . . "<p>"What is it dear?"<p>"I . . . well before I had my curse locked Ranma made a "deposit" at a clinic in Nerima and well . . . if we have a baby it will be "Ranma's" too," with much blushing and stammering Michiru finally finished her sentence.<p>The nova-like smile on her mama's face was reward enough for the embarrassment she felt.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"How Long do you think they'll be in there mama?" Hotaru questioned for the twelfth time her impatience clear in her voice.<p>"I don't know dear. Be patient we'll . . . "Setsuna hadn't even finished her response before Hotaru's question was answered. Pluto's voice trailed off as she sat there in amazement.<p>Michiru was leaving the house with another woman . . . one who looked like a slightly older version of the Neptune Princess. Everything about the pair screamed "These two are mother and daughter" Their hair was the same fiery red, the older woman was slightly taller, but they shared the same voluptuous build . . . they even walked the same with a sinuous . . . and definitely sexy walk that was likely to stop traffic. Other than the height and age difference only their clothing didn't match. Pluto's eyes bulged as she took in Michiru's outfit. What was the normally impeccably dressed Michiru doing wearing a set of Chinese silks that were at least three sizes to large? Heck it looked like she was swimming in them. Setsuna had to admit they made her look awfully cute, but that still didn't answer the question of why she was wearing them.<p>The normally inscrutable expression she normally wore was traded in for a look of utter astonishment. Just what the hell was going on? Michiru was an orphan . . . if she wasn't then why had she been in the orphanage. Setsuna knew that Michiru had been adopted. Heck she had even watched Michiru in the orphanage a few time for Kami's sake. Who was this woman and who was she to Michiru?. The momentary loss of control was quickly over and Setsuna glanced over at her companions.<p>Hotaru's expression mirrored her own. Obviously the young girl hadn't ever seen her Michiru-mama dressed like this, and she was just as much as a loss as to who the other woman was. Setsuna heard her whisper a single word, a name . . . "Ranko". Hotaru seemed at a loss though, as confusion was dripping from her words like rain from the roof after a thunderstorm.<p>Switching her gaze to Usa, Setsuna noted, with some annoyance, a look of satisfaction mixed with glee. Obviously the young Moon Princess knew the other woman . . . and likely knew just what was going on.<p>They waited for the pair to pass, and could make out part of their conversation. Michiru was saying something about inviting her family over for a visit tomorrow. The older woman nodded, her eyes lighting up like a Christmas tree as she confirmed that she was looking forward to that.<p>When the pair was safely out of sight Setsuna rounded on her two charges.<p>"Hotaru, who is Ranko?"<p>"I'm not sure Setsuna-mama," Hotaru responded. "She was in a couple of pictures that Tendo Kasumi showed me yesterday. They didn't talk about her much, just said her name was Tendo Ranko and that she was living at the dojo with the Tendos and Saotomes. It was kind of strange though. Kasumi started to tell me about her and mama cut her off. She said it wasn't important. The thing was she was dressed just like that . . . just like mama was now."<p>"Was there anything else?" Setsuna probed further.<p>"Just that Ranko had been living at the dojo for the last couple of years. Setsuna-mama, what is going on? Is Michiru-mama Ranko? If she is how did she pull it off and why?"<p>Setsuna turned to the remaining member of the trio, to be joined by Hotaru as they gave the gimlet eye to Chibi-Usa.<p>"Well Small Lady, what can you tell us about this?"<p>Their only answer was a short. "I can't tell you yet," and the smug, almost evil grin plastered across the young girls expressive face.<p>"You do know what they say about payback don't you Usa-chan," Hotaru threatened/warned after hearing the non-answer her best friend offered.<p>If anything the neo-princess's infernal grin only widened, as she nodded but didn't speak another word.<p>Hotaru and Setsuna sighed in unison and exchanged a frustrated look.<p>Setsuna was the first to find her voice. "I told myself to be at the next location just before noon. That's still about three hours from now. Should we go home and wait or kill some time at the mall?"<p>"The mall," Usa advised.<p>"The mall Setsuna-mama," Hotaru agreed, "I don't think I could take just sitting and waiting."<p>"The mall it is then," Setsuna agreed.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Two hours, a train ride and taxi later Nodoka and Ranma stood at the foot of the pathway leading to the Misaki shrine and the home of their sensei.<p>Ranma looked at her mother, a gentle smile on her face.<p>"One way or the other this is going to be over soon."<p>"One way or the other," Nodoka agreed, "Are you ready?"<p>"I think so mama. Let's go see Sensei and Tenchi."<p>The walk was peaceful. The sun was shining, the birds singing. The Masaki shrine was like an oasis of peace in a world that was often turbulent and unsettling. To walk these woods was like going back three hundred years, no sign of modern Japan could be seen from here. The women could literally feel the aura of calm that permeated the countryside. It didn't take Long before they arrived at a fork in the path, one way led further up the mountainside, the other toward a rather large house they could see in the distance.<p>"Sensei said to meet him at the house," Nodoka offered, "He also said they had guests living there now."<p>"The house it is then," Ranma agreed.<p>A few minutes later they arrived. The house itself was a wooden structure with two and a half or three stories, depending on how you counted it. It was well built and seemed to meld into the area without disturbing the tranquility of the small meadow it was located in.<p>Ranma pushed the doorbell and could hear a gentle chiming echo though the house, the sound followed by light rapid footsteps.<p>The door opened and a gentle voice greeted them, "Hello, can I help you?"<p>Ranma looked down into the incredibly cute face of a young pre-teen. She had Long bluish hair, nearly the shad of her own locks when "colored". The girl had a friendly smile on her face and pink eyes twinkled merrily as if the girl knew the punch line to a very amusing joke. She was dressed in an unusual housedress that just seemed to fit her personality to a tee.<p>"I am Sat . . . Nodoka, and this is Kaiou Michiru." Nodoka began the introductions, paused to correct herself then finished with a bow to their hostess.<p>Ranma echoed the bow and felt a smile forming on her lips. The girl just had that effect on her.<p>"We are here to see Sensei Masaki," Ranma added.<p>"Yes, grandfather said that he was expecting guests. Please come in."<p>Ranma looked at the girl questioningly, then stepped out of her shoes and entered as requested. Ranma was puzzled by the girl's answer. She thought that Tenchi was Katsuhito's only grandchild, and this girl was obviously to old to be Tenchi's child unless he had adopted Sasami like she had Hotaru.<p>When they entered the house they saw several other's present and waiting. Ranma spotted her sensei, seemingly untouched by time, as he looked no older than the first time Ranma had seen him. His aura of power was untouched as well, and told her that all was well with her sensei. Ranma still recalled the first time she had sensed her sensei's battle aura, she had been astounded to discover that it was stronger than both Ku Lon and Happosai and gratified to learn that the sword master was willing to teach her.<p>Ranma then looked over at Tenchi. Ten-chan looked the same physically, but his aura was unbelievably stronger. It was as if he was at a whole new level. Ranma's mouth watered at the though of sparring with her friend. Tenchi gave her a rather strained smile, strained probably due to the pair of stunningly attractive women hanging on his arms.<p>On the left was a regal looking woman in formal robes of a type Ranma had never seen before. They were reminiscent of a kimono, but were subtly different in cut and style. She had Long purple hair and matching purple eyes. The expression on her face was one that Ranma was only to familiar with, they were appraising her with a rather "Nabiki like" gaze, but the grip she had on Tenchi's arm was far from emotionless and said MINE in no uncertain terms.<p>Where the woman on the left radiated poise and gave Ranma the impression of royalty, the woman glomped, (and there was no better expression than that to use) on Ten-chan's right arm was a study in opposites. Where as the purple-haired girl's very being screamed nobility, the cyan haired woman with amber eyes was the embodiment of sensuality. Her eyes were much more open in their message. Her eyes said, "Touch him and die".<p>Three others of note also sat around the table. There was a deeply tanned blond with a body to die for and next to her an attractive woman with Long teal colored hair. Pretty, very pretty indeed but with the look Ranma had seen best shown by Long service policemen, a look that was impersonally friendly, but ever so watchful. This one was all business. The final member was a young girl with wild red hair of her own. Its color matched the fiery locks of Ranma and her mother, but where theirs was restrained this girl's was wild and untamed, flowing nearly to the floor. In some ways her hair reminded Ranma of the amber-eyed girl's hair, but the girl clinging to Tenchi was to young to have a daughter that old. Perhaps they were sisters?<p>"Aunty Nodoka, Michiru, it's good to see you again," Tenchi greeted the pair.<p>Ranma couldn't resist. A pout formed on her full lips at the greeting and a kawaii frown creased her forehead.<p>"Ten-chan, why so formal? What happened to Mi-chan?"<p>Nodoka found herself fighting back a smile, an expression she saw mirrored on her sensei's normally impassive face.<p>"Uhmm, Maybe I'd better introduce you to everyone," Tenchi evaded uncomfortably.<p>"But Ten-chan . . . "Ranma pouted, the expression somehow becoming even more cute than before, if that was even possible. "I haven't seen you in so Long . . . no hug and kiss for me now?"<p>Ranma could see the two women stiffen as her words sank in . . . and they processed the implications of her words. Ranma watched as their aura's exploded, not reaching the visible spectrum . . . not quite at least, but nearly so. It was interesting to see just how powerful they were. Yet there was something not quite right about their auras. The one with purple hair's aura reminded Ranma of someone . . . then with a quick start she realized it was similar to Sensei Masaki's aura, similar if weaker. The other woman's aura was like nothing she'd ever seen, and dwarfed the one put out by her companion.<p>"Michiru that . . . "Nodoka began, hoping to defuse the situation before a brawl broke out. Before she could finish her statement she was interrupted.<p>"Girl, stop teasing Tenchi," Katsuhito ordered, uncharacteristically stopping her fun. Normally he loved it when she teased his grandson, even though he too knew that she wasn't interested in boys.<p>"Hai Sensei," Ranma affirmed, the pout dropping from her face. "I'm sorry Tenchi."<p>The relief on Tenchi's face was unmistakable as he relaxed, happy that for once his grandfather had chosen to help instead of egg Ayeka and Ryoko on. Unfortunately his relief came a bit to soon. He sighed as he saw the pixie grin return to his friends face.<p>"Why don't you introduce me to all these lovely women," Ranma stressed her words, a seductive lustful smile replacing the pout, and this time directed at Tenchi's companions instead of the young Misaki himself.<p>It was all she could do to keep from laughing at the sudden change of expression the various woman had with this the quick change of focus. She hadn't had this much fun in ages.<p>"Michiru!" Katsuhito thundered.<p>"Hai sensei, I'll be good," Ranma fake pouted for a moment before letting the expression go.<p>"Don't worry ladies. I'm not after Tenchi, my interests lie . . . elsewhere," Ranma gave both girls one last appraisal, her wink encompassing all of the older girls.<p>The ice having been broken, and Ryoko and Ayeka reassured that this girl at least had no designs on "their" Tenchi, the introductions themselves were over in a moment. Settling around the table. Ranma relaxed, enjoying the conversation. Her mama and sensei were talking quietly, brining each other up to date on their lives.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Sensei," Nodoka started hesitantly, she hated to air her dirty laundry in so public a forum, but she could hold herself back no longer. She had to know if she could continue to practice her Art. She was not quite as intense as her daughter, but her passion for the sword came amazingly close to the passion Michiru held for her unique art. "I have formally broken with my husband. I am now ronin. I ask that I be allowed to continue in the Masaki School however."<p>Everyone noticed the pleased smile that accompanied the beginning of the statement . . . and the frown on Katsuhito's face when he heard that his student was ronin. The alien girls might not understand just what that meant, but the frown on grandfather Katsuhito's face clearly showed that the news was not good.<p>"Your family is not willing to take you back on their family register?" he asked gently.<p>"No sensei, they are not. The Isagomo Clan has a Long and proud history. My brother says that I have tarnished my honor and that to allow me to return to the Clan would tarnish their honor as well were he to allow my return."<p>"Honor is important, but so is family," Katsuhito answered softly. "What of your other family?"<p>"My brother is the Clan head, his word is law in this matter," Nodoka answered softly, her eyes shining but no tears fell as she continued. "I understand his words and reasoning. Our Clan has been samurai for generations with a Long and honorable history." Nodoka stated proudly. "I would do nothing else to harm my Clan . . . marrying Saotome Genma has done enough damage," she admitted.<p>Nodoka paused watching her daughter. Ranma/Michiru didn't know much of her Clan. Nodoka had been cast out shortly after marrying her father, so she had never met any of her Isagomo relations. Given the situation she was unlikely to meet them, and if she did her own situation would prevent any recognition of the family bond.<p>While Michiru's face was calm, with the eyes of a mother Nodoka could see the pain hidden in the depths of her daughter's eyes. Pain that mirrored her own. Michiru obviously knew that family meant much to her mama, no matter how she appeared to accept the judgment.<p>Nodoka tried, and managed a small smile. "The Isagomo Claim has been known for its warriors for a thousand years. We have had both samurai and samurai-ko with skills that became legend. I t is even said that my many times removed grandmother Funaho caught the heart of a demon prince and was whisked away to his kingdom to reign with him. Her loss was a blow to the Clan, her skills with the sword were the greatest of her generation, but love called and she left the Clan with the permission of her son."<p>Nodoka paused for a moment before continuing, "Funaho had been a widow for nearly sixteen years having been wed at fourteen. Her Lord had died soon after the marriage leaving her to raise her son to take command of the Clan and to follow in the footsteps of a father he never knew. The demon prince Azusa had come and suddenly Funaho was acting like a young girl instead of a woman of thirty years. Her son was saddened to lose her, but overjoyed at her newfound happiness. He had just taken his position as head of the Clan so he had the authority to release her from her duty to the Clan and to allow her to follow her heart. Isagomo Sojuro ruled Long and well and made sure that his mother's name was remembered with pride and held in honor."<p>Ranma and Nodoka were startled at the look of shock on the faces of their hosts. Sensei Masaki, Tenchi, Ayeka and the others all shared a look of shocked disbelief.<p>"Did you say Funaho?" Ayeka stuttered, her words echoed by Tenchi and Ryoko.
