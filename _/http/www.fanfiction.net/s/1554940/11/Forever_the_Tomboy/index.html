</div>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer<p>A/N – 1. Sorry for the delay. As I've said before my goal is to post a chapter every 2-3 weeks. I'll be quicker when I can, but these last few chapters have been kinda long (32 pages and a sentence in Word) so it takes a while. As to Chapter 11 parts of it have been written and re-written 3-4 times as it wasn't coming out quite like I wanted – let me know what you think as to how it turned out. A/N -2. Chapter 12 is started – and depending on workload should be done on schedule – hopefully sooner, but please bear with me. A/N – 3 If anyone is interested there is an old story posted on FictionPress that is an original story (I guess that's a bit redundant as that is what ficpress is) if anyone wants to take a look you can search using the ranger5 penname - if there is enough response there are several more chapters done that I could upload. If original fiction isn't your thing don't worry about it<p>Forever the Tomboy Ch. 11 -<p>Dealing with Old "Friends"<p>Hotaru's mind was filled to overflowing with questions as she looked down into her mama's icy blue eyes. The warmth, the soft glow of love that she was used to seeing in them gone, and left behind implacable purpose. The young senshi had never heard her mama sound so . . . well . . . dangerous before. The very air seemed to freeze around Michiru as she spoke the boy's name and if she didn't know better she could almost believe the temperature in the room had dropped twenty degrees or more. Hotaru shivered as she heard the promise of pain in her mama's words. Hotaru knew that this Ryouga was going to be in for a world of pain when Michiru got her hands on him.<p>What was even more confusing was that her mama clearly knew the boy, and just as clearly had some kind of relationship or connection to him . . . and apparently it hadn't been a good connection, nor had it ended well to judge by Ryouga's impassioned cries for revenge. Was he the reason her mama liked girls? Yet even that didn't make sense, at least not totally. It didn't explain why she had never heard of him before, her mama grew up in Juban and she didn't think he was from her home ward. Nor had she ever heard her mama mention his name. Though she had to admit if he was a former boyfriend her mama might not have been willing to talk about him. Even that didn't take into account the other questions the boy's actions raised. He too had called her mama Ranma. Why would he do that, and even more puzzling why would Michiru respond to that name. She hadn't even blinked when Ryouga came roaring out of no-where with his insane challenge.  It was possible that Michiru was still in shock from her fight with Happosai, but Hotaru didn't think that was it . . . or at least not all of it. Michiru had looked . . . resigned . . . as if the boy's presence though unexpected, wasn't unusual.<p>But how, if some boy had been bothering Michiru-mama, Haruka-papa would have been more than happy to "take care of it". Taking a deep breath Hotaru considered what little she did know. The boy seemed familiar somehow, but where had she seen him. The action in the meadow had occurred so quickly that she hadn't had time to listen to the little nagging voice in the back of her mind telling her that she knew the boy.<p>Now that she had a few moments to think about it she had seen the boy before. He had been prominently featured in the pictures and stories that Kasumi had told her yesterday. Kasumi had mentioned him by name and described him as a rival/friend of Saotome Ranma. But if he was a friend, why the attack from no-where, and why the hatred in his voice. Kasumi had gone on in great detail about the fights the "lost boy" had with Ranma, but she had never said exactly what caused the fights. Kasumi had even confided that due to Ryouga's curse no one knew where he was right now. Shaking her head in frustration Hotaru continued to think, her body on autopilot as she healed her mama and restored her energy.<p>What little she knew about the boy didn't help much. In fact it still didn't explain anything about why Ryouga was mad at her mama, nor why he had called Michiru by the name Ranma. Hotaru was a bit worried about the fact that he had said that he was mad because of the way "Ranma" had treated Tendo Akane. That was another name she recognized. Tendo Akane was Kasumi-san's younger sister, the one her mama had said wasn't a true martial artist. That statement made it clear that Michiru knew Akane, (which made sense as Michiru was friends with Kasumi), but what exactly was the connection? Was Ryouga Akane's boyfriend instead? Maybe her mama had been after Akane and done something that broke up Ryouga and Akane. That would make more sense than to think her mama had ever had a boyfriend. Still, that didn't seem right either. The way Kasumi had talked about "Ranma" he had lived at the Tendo dojo for a couple of years, and he was the fiancé of Akane and several other girls. Hotaru silently cursed her lack of knowledge. Nothing made sense. What did Ranma's relationships have to do with her mama? It just didn't make sense, none of it did and her ignorance was beginning to frustrate her to no end.<p>To make matters even more confusing, the old man had used the name Ranma when he was talking with Michiru, (that is when he wasn't calling her "boy"). What the heck was up with that? Michiru (wearing those strange Chinese clothes that were two sizes or more to big) was clearly a girl. Hotaru blushed as she considered her mama's "assets", no one with eyes in their heads could confuse her mama with a boy, not like Haruka-papa anyway.  Yet Michiru had answered to both names . . . and she hadn't even acted surprised or upset to be called Ranma.<p>Her mama couldn't be Ranma. The only Ranma she knew of was the Saotome Ranma that Kasumi had told her about yesterday, and he was obviously a boy.  Not only that but he was taller, had black hair and (from Kasumi's stories) didn't act anything like Michiru. Kasumi, nice girl that she was, had used the word immature to describe him, though she said that was mostly his father's fault. To be fair Kasumi had also described him as brave, honest, honorable and someone who tried his best to put others before himself. Hotaru had been left with the impression that this Ranma was a diamond in the rough, but her mama was nothing like that. Her mama could be the poster-girl of elegance and refinement, Hotaru hoped that someday she could be like her mama.<p>What made matters even more confusing, Michiru did look exactly like Tendo Ranko, the girl that Michiru had refused to let Kasumi tell her about. That didn't make sense either. The two looked so much alike with Michiru's newly colored red hair that they could pass as the same person if they dressed alike.<p>From what Kasumi had managed to tell her before Michiru cut her off, Ranko had been living with the Tendos for almost two years, well that and that Ranko was the world's biggest tomboy . . . so she couldn't be her mama either. Hotaru's first thought (when she saw Michiru leaving the Saotome house earlier today) was that Ranko was Michiru's sister, maybe even her twin. After all Michiru was an orphan so maybe she had a sister and the orphanage had separated them. That made more sense, but even if that were true it didn't explain everything. If that were the case why hadn't Michiru ever mentioned a sister? . . . and why had she dressed in those weird Chinese style clothes to come up here? There was one thing Hotaru knew, she was going to do her best to find out just what the HELL was going on.<p>Hotaru had suffered a large number of shocks over the last couple of days, and at the rate things were going it didn't appear that this was going to change in the near future.<p>To say she was confused was to severely understate her current situation Heck she'd be glad if she were only "confused" instead of being totally lost. These thoughts flickered through her mind in a heartbeat. Yet before she could ask her mama anything, she heard a soft laugh interrupting her thoughts and stopping any further conversation.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma looked up into her daughters deep purple eyes. What was Hotaru doing here? Dammit, no one was supposed to know she was here. Ranma loved her daughter, but right now she wished Hotaru were anywhere but here. Looking around she amended that thought to add another question. Just where the heck was here anyway?<p>The last thing she remembered was Ryouga hitting Hotaru when her daughter tried to stop him from attacking her after her fight with Happosai. Well that and the groundswell of total and utter rage quickly followed by waves of depression as she saw Hotaru knocked several yards away by Ryouga's umbrella. Ranma knew only to well what one of Ryouga's "umbrella attacks" felt like, and she knew that Hotaru was no match for that attack, (at least when she wasn't transformed). She had feared the worst, a punch from Ryouga was more than capable of killing a normal person. Somehow the bastard must've managed to pull the blow. Hotaru hadn't been killed as she had first feared, after all the senshi of Saturn knelt by her side, her hands glowing as she used her healing gift. Ranma could literally feel herself heal under her daughter's hands.<p>Ranma wasn't entirely sure what had happened next, but she thought she had unleashed a Perfect Shishi Hokoudan on Ryouga. The Lost Boy had been transfixed by his error in hitting an innocent girl instead of his target, so he hadn't even tried to evade, nor even twitched a muscle before the ki attack blasted the two of them into unconsciousness.<p>Ranma's thoughts were still muddled and confused as she looked up into her daughter's face, but not so muddled that she didn't see the high-tech nightmare that they were in. The area looked like something out of a mad scientists wet dream. Most of the stuff she saw she couldn't even begin to put a name to, and even the few things that looked identifiable might or might not actually be what appeared to be.<p>Trying desperately to pull herself together, Ranma retuned her (still rather unfocused) gaze to her daughter, her mind turning back to its original line of questioning. What was Hotaru doing here anyway . . . and how had she known to come to the Masaki Shrine today?<p>Her emotions were a jumbled mess. Combined with the confusion she was feeling at Hotaru's presence was a growing fear as she wondered just how much Hotaru had seen and heard. If her daughter had been here from the beginning there was going to be Hell to pay . . .and it was more than likely that she would be the one paying. How was she going to be able to explain today's events? Even worse, how was she going to be able to explain what had led up to them?<p>Ranma knew one thing, her new life was at risk. What would her friends think about her if the truth came out? Would they join the throngs who considered her nothing more than a "freak" and "pervert"? Ranma desperately hoped they wouldn't . . . but her prior experiences with her curse made a happy ending unlikely if . . . no when the truth came out.<p>No matter how much she tried to deny it the opinions of the other senshi meant a lot to her. They were her friends and her only real companions . . . they were more her family than her adoptive parents were that much was certain. What Haruka, Hotaru and Setsuna thought (and how they reacted when they found out the truth) would be of critical importance, but Ranma also knew that if the "Inners" or her Princess rejected her that it would hurt . . . and hurt a lot.<p>Before she could begin her interrogation of Hotaru, indeed before she was even able to rise Ranma's thoughts were interrupted by a soft laugh and teasing words.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Washu smiled at the scene in front of her, somehow managing to ignore the damage that had been done to the medical section of her lab. Two of her patients were out, and apparently attempting to escape. She had to smile at their determination, of course they didn't know that it was virtually impossible to get out of the pocket dimension her lab was in . . . unless she let them. A frown crossed the scientist's face as she considered the bane of her existence. There was one person who was able to get in and out of her lab, seemingly without problems. The impossible happened all the time around a certain blond Galaxy Policewoman. How Mihoshi got in and out of her lab without triggering any alarms or tripping her automatic security protocols was a mystery that Washu wasn't sure she'd ever solve. Her self- satisfied smile flickered as she considered her blond nemesis. One day, she vowed she'd figure it out . . . then the blond walking disaster would never get back in.<p>Washu returned her gaze to the women in front of her. She assumed that both were her patients, as the four humans were the only ones other than herself that were in the lab and two of the four healing tubes were shattered and empty.<p>The woman lying on the floor was clearly Michiru, though surprisingly enough the girl appeared to be awake. The red haired genius hypothesized that the other girl, the one in the rather revealing sailor fuku and cradling a rather impressive pole-arm, was the girl who had darted out of the woods and attempted to protect Michiru. (Of course that hypothesis was made simpler by the fact that her two remaining patients were both male . . . and both lacked the rather strange magical field that surrounded Michiru.  The boy Ryouga did possess an aura of magic, but it was quite different than the one around Michiru. True in some ways it was similar to the weaker field surrounding Michiru, but it had no relationship to the much stronger field that enveloped the other redhead.<p>Still, the thought was a hypothesis and not a fact . . . yet as something was interfering with her ability to actually recognize the girl. Even her sensors were experiencing difficulties and were giving conflicting readings. It seemed that the smaller girl was generating some kind of magical disguise or distortion field. It wasn't a separate field, as it appeared to be a minor side effect of the magic that she had used to transform into her current state.<p>However, given the fact that her lab was safely moored in a sub-space pocket all its own it was indeed highly unlikely that the girl was anyone other than Michiru's daughter. Well that and (as she had noted earlier) two of the healing tubes were empty. They obviously hadn't been empty for long Washu could still hear the dripping sound of the green healing gel as it fell onto the floor of her lab.<p>Washu's fingers danced along the keyboard as she analyzed the healing technique or procedure that the fuku clad girl was using. Before she could finish her analysis another screen popped up in the holographic display. The image displayed was the girl with the glaive and a menu of options. What was even more interesting to the child-like genius was that the picture came with a name . . . Sailor Saturn.<p>Washu made it a practice to monitor all of the Earth's electronic broadcasts and she had seen stories of the senshi on the local television channels on many occasions. In fact Washu liked to monitor the girls activities and was a closet fan of theirs. Despite her cynical nature the idea of "magical girls" fighting monsters in the name of "truth and love" was something she found both endearing and entertaining.<p>The diminutive genius's eyes flashed in triumph as several facts slid into place. If this girl was Sailor Saturn, then the energy spike her sensors had recorded a short while before the duel was probably the result of a teleport spell. It seemed that one or more senshi had (for some reason or other) come in to watch the duel. That meant that the senshi must have some connection with Michiru. If that were true then perhaps . . . .<p>Once again the genius's fingers flew across the keys of her computer at speeds that would rival the Amiguriken technique that Michiru had used during her match. Washu's smile widened as she considered the implications that the senshi's presence had on the present situation. That one or more of them had been there to observe the fight AND that they had done so surreptitiously told Washu that they hadn't come at Michiru's invitation. Which meant that Michiru didn't want them here for some reason. Washu's grin widened even more, threatening to split her face if it grew any more. Washu loved a mystery. In her long life she had seen much, done even more and as a result boredom was something she had to fight on a regular basis. Mysteries challenged her, kept her from losing interest in life, and she had several wrapped up in one rather attractive form (in Michiru) and then dropped right into her lap. One thing was certain, today was a banner day for the red haired scientist.<p>Washu's nose wrinkled as she grinned ever so cutely. The expression was so far beyond cute that it could literally rot a person's teeth just by seeing it. It looked like today was going to be even more interesting than she originally thought . . . and if the girl really was Saturn, it was likely that the Michiru was a senshi as well. Yes, today was turning out to be enjoyable indeed.<p>Quickly correlating the new data it didn't take her long to discover that yes, one of the magical fields surrounding Michiru was clearly "planetary/elemental" magic. A few more moments passed as she tried, and finally succeeded in pinning that one down as well. If her calculations were correct, (and they always were) then Michiru was indeed a senshi – probably Sailor Neptune given the affinity for water that she detected in two of the magical fields.<p>Washu found she couldn't hold back her laughter any more and softly chucked, not her usual "I'm a genius" laugh, but a true expression of mirth. Things were looking up, if she played her cards right she might gain two new guinea pigs to play with. Given the power levels that both displayed she would do her best to make sure they were willing before she did anything to extreme. They might not wield the Lighthawk Wings, but the power levels that Saturn was giving off made her a force to be reckoned with. If her readings were any indication the girl could literally destroy the earth. While Washu and her lab might be able to survive that event, the rest of the Masaki's couldn't . . . at least not without enough warning being given for Tenchi to employ the Wings of the Light Hawk.<p>Michiru might not have the same absolute power level as Saturn, but she had demonstrated abilities today that (even untransformed) would make her a formidable foe if antagonized. Yes it would be best if she obtained their willing cooperation.<p>"I see you two are awake," she began, "But don't you think destroying part of my medical lab was a bit extreme?"<p>Washu's emerald eyes widened at the result of her simple speech. Despite knowing just how fast Michiru could move she was still surprised by how quickly both reacted to her unexpected announcement.<p>Saturn snatched her glaive up from its resting place next to her and fell into an offensive stance, the weapon held blade up and at the ready. The look in her purple eyes was one of defiant resolve. She was clearly ready to do whatever it took to protect Michiru. Michiru moved nearly as quickly literally flowing up from her recumbent position to joining her daughter in a ready position. Even though she was unarmed Washu did not make the mistake of thinking her as being any less than extremely dangerous.<p>"Of course it's not like she really needs a weapon," Washu mused, "She is a weapon all by herself."<p>"Whoa there, calm down. No-one is going to hurt either one of you," Washu spoke gently, trying to project a feeling of calm, much as she would to ease the fears of a wild animal she was trying to soothe.<p>Neither girl moved from their positions for several long seconds as they searched the darkness surrounding them, then Michiru relaxed.<p>Motioning to her companion she spoke in soft, guarded tones.<p>"Hold on Saturn. That sounded like Washu, she was with the Masaki's earlier when I met with Katsuhito-sensei."<p>Saturn nodded and dropped the Silence Glaive into a resting position. The butt of the weapon grounded by her right foot, but from the way she gripped the weapon Saturn was still obviously more than ready to bring it into play if she needed to.<p>"If you say so Michiru." Hotaru answered carefully avoiding the word mama. It was likely that Washu had seen the transformation. She had certainly responded to her breaking from the glass prison she and her mama had been in. That wasn't a certainty however as the timing of her entrance could be nothing more than coincidence. If Washu hadn't seen the transformation and didn't already know who she was she wasn't going to give her extra clues now.<p>"So Washu, just where are we?" Michiru queried.<p>"You are in my lab. Both of you were hurt pretty badly so I brought you here so I could treat your injuries."<p>"And just where is here. This place looks huge." Michiru continued.<p>"Well. To be honest this is a pocket dimension I created in sub-space to house my laboratory. This is actually just one level of the lab."<p>"Wow. Just how many levels are there?" Saturn questioned her natural curiosity getting the better of her.<p>"That varies. I can change the size of the lab pretty easily." Washu bragged. "Right now I have seven levels. This one is the top level. When we leave here we'll be back at Tenchi's house."<p>Washu paused a moment before continuing. "Michiru, I see that the girl here is Sailor Saturn. So which Senshi are you? I'd guess Neptune or Mercury as your aura indicates an affinity for water, though my guess is Neptune."<p>Michiru sighed, it seemed to be a pattern that had evolved over the last few days. She had been constantly forced into revealing more about herself than she was really comfortable doing. Still, it was clear that it was far too late to pretend innocence or ignorance now, at least so far as Washu was concerned. Perhaps turnabout was fair play, after all she had deduced that most of the Masaki residents were in fact aliens . . . or at least weren't "normal" humans. They didn't feel like any oni she had run across before so she had her money on aliens, at least so far.<p>"Yes, I am Sailor Neptune," Michiru answered. "I would ask that you keep that information confidential and that you don't tell any of the others here."<p>"Well . . . "Washu paused. "If you'll agree to let me do some tests on the two of you I think I can agree to that. I have a few questions that I'd like to ask you though," pausing for effect Washu then finished her sentence. "Just how it is that someone . . . a girl . . . like you can be a senshi.<p>Ever observant, Washu did not miss the flinch that her question brought to Michiru's face, nor the lightning quick glance she shot the younger girl's way. It was obvious that Michiru had caught the slight stress on certain words in the question. The genius didn't miss the look of confusion playing on Saturn's face at her choice of words.<p>"It's not much different for me than any of the other girls," Michiru answered her question after a long pause. "We're the reincarnations of the previous Senshi." She finished, doing her best to dance on the delicate line between truth and falsehood.<p>Michiru paused, considering the rest of her response carefully. "I can't tell you about the other senshi without their permission and permission from the Princess." Michiru answered softly but with implacable firmness.<p>"That still doesn't answer my question about your ability to become a magical girl," Washu probed. It seemed clear that Saturn didn't know to what she was referring, and the scientist didn't know how Michiru would react to having her secret revealed.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Even as she spoke Ranma didn't miss the irony of her statement. ". . . any of the other girls" indeed. How many times had she denied that she was a girl? Back in Nerima Ranma had not only denied any possibility of being a girl, she had been responded to each accusation with a firm denial, said denial usually accompanied by a loud yell, defiant look and the threat of immediate bodily harm unless the accuser recanted the statement immediately. Despite the gravity of the situation Ranma had to smile. Oh how things had changed in the course of living through two new lifetimes.<p>The kami's sense of humor must be strange indeed. For the first two years after getting the curse her goal had been to cure it. She had firmly rejected any statement, or even the slightest implication, that she was a girl. Now the thought of being a boy or called a boy was just as (or even more) distasteful than her original fear of being/becoming a girl.<p>Ranma's heart plunged as she darted a quick look over at her daughter. Hotaru had obviously caught Washu's words. True, Hotaru looked more confused than anything, but she knew the stubborn look on Hotaru's face only to well, she had seen it many times before. Hotaru was normally a quiet and unassuming girl, sometimes too much so for Ranma's tastes, but once she decided something was important she could be as stubborn as a mule. When she did she got a certain look on her face . . . and the expression on her face now was just that look. Hotaru was going to follow up on this come Hell or High Water. Nope, when she got that look it was serious, Hotaru was not going to let her just brush this off. Her daughter was going to want answers and want them soon.<p>Of course that probably would've been true even if Washu hadn't uttered a word. Hotaru's mere presence her, (when the girl shouldn't even have known about today's fight) spoke volumes about what Hotaru already knew, or at least guessed. Ranma felt sick as she considered the possibilities. If Hotaru was here then Setsuna had probably brought her, and if Hotaru was here with Pluto then it was a better than even chance that at the very least Chibi-Usa was here as well and Kami knows who else saw the debacle in the meadow . . . and who else may have heard her negotiations with the old letch.<p>Yep, she could almost see Pluto's hand in all of this. The question was why now? Pluto had never even hinted at knowing of her past until yesterday, now her fingerprints were all over the situation. Ranma had always feared that Setsuna would find out about her past, and to be honest she was surprised that Pluto hadn't interfered before . . . or if she had she had kept the knowledge to herself and covered her tracks well.<p>A slight grin made it's way across Ranma's face. It was also obvious that Haruka wasn't here, and for that she thanked whatever Kami were listening. If her hot-tempered lover had been at the fight she would never have been able to keep her presence a secret, and her interference would have cost her the fight. Even if Haruka had somehow managed to stay out of her fight with Happosai she would never have let Hotaru run into danger. Hell, Haruka would've hammered Ryouga before Hotaru could have taken more than a step or two into the clearing.<p>Ranma's grin died a quick and gruesome death as another thought occurred to her. Haruka would've interfered and would've come to her aid . . . or would she. Ranma's heart sank even further as she considered another possibility. What if Haruka had been present, but had been so disgusted by what she had seen and heard that she didn't want to even see her right now.  Maybe she had seen and heard enough to decide that she didn't want to continue their relationship anymore.<p>Ranma weaved unsteadily as she fought her fear. NO! she told herself. Haruka wouldn't do that to her. The blonde had promised last night to always be there for her . . . she had promised to listen. If Haruka had been here she would at least have waited to talk to her before deciding to break things off . . . wouldn't she?<p>A small voice inside Ranma's head took a different position. "Sure" it said, "She promised to listen to her girlfriend to Michiru . . . she didn't say anything about a gender changing freak like Ranma." Ranma tried to ignore the voice, but as much as she tried she could still hear her fears speaking, whispering of the doom that was yet to come.<p>Dammit when was life going to cut her a break? Ranma knew that most of what had happened over the last few days was entirely her fault. Hell, if she'd been willing to ignore Hotaru's pleas yesterday and not taken her to Nerima Hotaru wouldn't know about Saotome Ranma, nor Ranko or Happosai. Now that Hotaru had seen those pictures and the events in the meadow it was too late. Like a genie released from its bottle the secrets were out and weren't going back in. Now the idea of keeping her family ignorant of her past was nothing but a pipe dream. Everything she'd worked so hard to keep hidden was coming out into the light, all of her skeletons were dancing in plain view for anyone to see.<p>Ranma cursed her own pride. Though not as often shown now, it was still a weakness that she had, a weakness that she was now going to pay for. It had been nothing but presumptive arrogance to assume that she could keep secrets from Pluto and the others and do what she'd been doing over the last few days. When she had first discovered her destiny as the Senshi of Neptune she had considered abandoning her long-standing plans to regain her art out of just this fear. The passage of time without her secrets coming to light had made her complacent and careless, now she would pay for that carelessness.<p>Shaking her head Ranma continued to rail at herself and her idiocy. She hadn't even considered what Chibi-Usa might know, what might have been revealed to those in her time.<p>If she had only been willing to leave things alone none of this would have come to light. If she had only been willing to give up the Art, been willing to ignore her connections to her past life in Nerima . . . if she'd been willing to ignore her honor. There might not be much of Ranma visible in Michiru, at least not on the outside, but they were the same person and honor meant a lot to both of her. Ranma tried to stifle a rather hysterical sounding giggle at that last thought. Even thinking about the mess that was her life wasn't easy.<p>"Honor meant a lot to both of her indeed." Despite her best efforts the laughter escaped, the normal mirthful sounds tinged with a bit of madness. The sounds drew looks of concern from both Hotaru and Washu as they obviously wondered if she was losing her mind. Their expressions did nothing to stifle her laughter.<p>Sighing in defeat, Ranma reached out and took Hotaru's free hand and gave it a squeeze. She was going to have to answer Washu's question, honor dictated no less given the circumstances . . . and what the girl obviously already knew. However, before she gave her answer she wanted one last bit on contact with her daughter, she wanted to pull a little bit of comfort from the girl she loved as if she was her own flesh and blood. Despite the minute long pause Ranma knew she could stall no more and knew as well that the truth was going to come out . . . and she desperately hoped that when it did she would still have a family to call her own.<p>"You obviously know something Washu or you wouldn't have asked your question quite that way," Ranma continued.<p>He saw Washu's nod of confirmation.<p>"I take it that the equipment here is capable of analyzing magic?"<p>Again Washu only nodded, for once content to listen without interruptions.<p>"I suppose you know about the "other" transformational curse."<p>For the third time the red-haired genius only nodded.<p>Ranma's shoulders slumped in defeat. It seemed clear that Washu did know something, probably the effect at least (if not the cause) of the curse. Of course with Happosai calling her boy and Ranma, it was no wonder that Washu had figured it out. The problem was that it wasn't just Washu. Ranma could tell from the look on Hotaru's face that her daughter had questions as well.<p>To be honest Ranma had little or no compunctions against lying to the red haired woman despite honor's call if her duty as a senshi demanded it. But she didn't want to lie anymore to her family, that was an honor debt of a completely different magnitude. Hotaru was here and listening, it was time that she told her the truth . . . even if her daughter hated her for it. Yes, it was time to reveal her most desperately guarded secret.<p>Ranma studied the floor, not willing to meet the eyes of either woman. It was then that she realized something that had escaped her previously. She was still naked. Hotaru was dressed in her fuku, it had appeared when she transformed, but she didn't have a stitch of clothing on.<p>Looking up Ranma continued, a lopsided grin locked on her face. "If I'm going to answer your question could I at least have some clothes?"<p>Washu blinked, and then surprisingly enough, blushed as she realized she'd been gazing intently at the naked girl before her. "Sorry about that. The healing gel works best if it can get to all of you and I was so interested in what my computers were telling me that I forgot.<p>Washu typed rapidly on her computer and a moment later a small pile of clothes fell from somewhere (or perhaps nowhere) to land at Michiru's feet.  They didn't rest there long as Michiru promptly grabbed and donned the garment in the blink of an eye. When she finished dressing, Michiru returned her attention to Hotaru and Washu.<p>"Hotaru, I hope you'll listen to me before you make any decisions . . . please promise me you will listen." Ranma caught and held her daughters eyes, trying to make her see just how important this was to her, trying to convince her to listen . . . and to not hate her for what she was going to reveal.<p>"I promise mama," Hotaru answered.<p>Ranma took a deep breath and revealed a secret that she had hoped was never going to come to light so far as her family was concerned. She had intended to deal with the mess in Nerima, and some of them were going to find out part of the truth . . . enough to give them a chance at new lives with honor intact . . . but only two were going to get all of the truth. Kasumi she had already confided in, Nabiki she intended to. She trusted both of them implicitly, something that Michiru could do that Ranma would never have been able to at least so far as the middle Tendo was concerned.<p>She owed it to them to reveal that she was locked as a girl so that they could move on with their own lives otherwise Xian Pu, Ukyo and Akane were in limbo, required by their own honor to seek "him" out at all costs or lose their own honor. Xian Pu had the most to lose, but she thought she had that taken care of. Hopefully the "other" Xian Pu would be able to see to that.<p>But even with them the revelations were going to be limited in scope. She was going to give them just enough to satisfy honor, but not enough for them to be able to interfere with her new life . . . at least that was the hope. If they didn't take the opportunity . . . well suffice it to say they would find out just how far Michiru would go to protect those dear to her. But she had hoped it would end there. Ranma knew she could handle their rejection, but if her own family did the same, that didn't bear thinking about.<p>"Mama, are you alright?"<p>Ranma was broken out of her reverie by her daughter's words.<p>Still unsure of how to begin, Ranma took a deep breath, hoping that a little humor would help. Even in her despair she managed to relish the irony of her chosen introduction to the truth.<p>"Hi, I'm Saotome Ranma, Sorry 'bout this,"<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Hotaru stared at her mama, panic rising from deep inside her soul. First her mama had been so lost in thought that she had sat unmoving for almost five minutes. For those long minutes time seemed to creep by as they waited for her answer. Finally her mama had pasted on a given a weak smile, a far cry from her usual warm expression, and spoke.<p>Despite what had been so clearly hinted at by both of the older women the words were still a shock for Hotaru to hear.<p>Her mama had just admitted that she was a boy . . . but how? Hotaru desperately searched her mother's face for any sign that this was a joke. Though Michiru presented a face to the rest of the world of the "perfect young lady" Hotaru knew differently. Her mama had a wicked sense of humor when she chose to employ it. This had to be a joke, it had to be.<p>Looking deeper though Hotaru realized it wasn't a joke, there was no twinkle in her mama's eyes, no hint of mischief. Instead of the usual poker face and well-hidden mirth she half expected, the young girl saw fear in her mama's eyes, and underneath the fear resignation. It was as if Michiru-mama was somehow both relieved that her secret was coming out and terrified at the same time . . . but it still didn't make sense. A curse? What kind of curse and how long had she had it. Even if she were cursed it still didn't make sense. Michiru was a girl, the Kaiou's had adopted her when she was only six years old for crying out loud, and she was a girl then. Ranma had been a boy all his life, and he was a teenager, the same age as her mama.<p>Fighting her own panic, Hotaru squeezed her mama's hand and tried to stay calm. But this was one battle that she wasn't going to win as she felt her world turning upside down.<p>"Mama, what are you talking about?" her confusion commingled with a desperate plea that all would be all right.<p>Michiru answered, pain resonating just as clearly in her own voice. "Washu do you have somewhere we can sit down? I don't think Hotaru is taking this well." Left unspoken was the fact that neither was she.<p>Washu nodded, and typed on her keyboard. Shortly thereafter three "cushions" appeared out of no-where and floated in the air. Washu promptly plopped down on one and motioned to the others to join her.<p>The three sat in silence for several moments, the quiet broken only by the humming of machinery in the background. Two of them trying to digest what had been said, and one hoping that everything would still manage to turn out okay.<p>Hotaru waited impatiently for her mama to begin. When it became clear that Michiru wasn't going to start immediately, Hotaru opened the conversation.<p>"Mama. What do you mean that you are Saotome Ranma? He's a boy who lives in Nerima with Kasumi-chan and the other Tendos . . . isn't he?"<p>"Hotaru," Michiru began only to stop as her voice broke.<p>Hotaru watched as her normally imperturbable mother tried to speak, stopped and tried again. Whatever Michiru was going to tell her obviously frightened her . . . and that terrified Hotaru. She'd never seen her mama like this before, not even in the worst of battles.<p>"Hotaru. I've been hiding a large part of my life from you, Haruka and the others. It's going to sound crazy, probably crazier than anything else you've ever heard or seen, but it's the truth. Before I start I want you to know that I'd never do anything to hurt you or the others, but I was afraid . . . "once again, Michiru broke down. No tears came, but her petite frame shook with silent sobs. It took her several moments and a couple of deep breaths before she could recover enough to continue.<p>"I promise that I'll tell you everything later, you, me, Haruka and Setsuna, you all deserve to know the truth . . . "Hotaru's heart nearly broke as she watched her mother try to smile, tried and failed miserably. Watching the imperturbable Kaiou Michiru break down was like watching the sun rise in the west, it was such an impossibility that the mind refused to accept it as fact.<p>"It's okay mama," Hotaru nearly cried as she saw Michiru flinch at her words. "Mama it's going to be okay." She spoke again, leaving her own cushion to join her mama on hers. Hotaru shoved her own confusion away as she tried to help her mama. Leaving her cushion Hotaru sat down and pulled her mama into a warm hug, trying to comfort the one who had so often comforted her.<p>The ghost of a smile finally graced Michiru's face as she looked down at her daughter. But the expression Hotaru saw was a far cry from the serene and loving smile that she normally received from her mama and Hotaru felt the fear return. Just what was it that was scaring her mama so badly . . . and how could she have ever been a boy?<p>"I hope you are right Hotaru-chan, I hope you are right," Steeling herself Michiru continued.<p>"The short of it is that I was born a boy. I was Saotome Ranma. I received a curse when I was in China on a martial arts training trip. When I was hit with cold water I turned into a girl, hot water would turn me back."<p>Michiru paused seeing the confusion in her daughter's eyes and the almost manic interest in the emerald green eyes of Washu.<p>"It's the truth, Hotaru," Michiru whispered. "I put up with the curse for almost two years. Ranma's life was hell. When I couldn't stand it anymore I found a way out."<p>"But mama," Hotaru interrupted still confused. "The Kaiou's adopted you when you were little. Didn't they know that you were a boy? And if you grew up in Juban how could you go on a ten year training trip?"<p>Michiru sighed, it seemed to be a habit today. "The short answer to all your questions is magic. I found and used magic to obtain a new life and in order to start fresh I became a child again."<p>"But wouldn't Pluto stop . . . "Hotaru broke off as she realized the answer to her own question.<p>If it were necessary that Ranma had to "die" and become Michiru it was likely that Pluto would not only allow it, she might well cause it to happen. Hotaru saw Michiru's confirming nod.<p>"I don't think she knew . . . at not least the one we have now, but in the future . . . who knows?"<p>Michiru sighed again. "As to the reason I had to do it. Well that's an entirely different matter. Basically my baka father tangled me with so many different honor debts that I couldn't satisfy them all so I had to find a way out. I knew of a way to time-travel and used it. I also locked my curse so that I wouldn't be a freak anymore." Michiru managed a weak smile for her daughter. "Believe me I know what it's like to be a freak. Very few people could handle my curse. The boys all wanted to get to know my girl side, the girls thought I was a pervert who used it . . . well lets just say they thought I was a pervert." Michiru finished.<p>Hotaru tried to speak, her mouth opened and though her lips moved, but no sound escaped. Even given the rather "unusual" childhood she had, this was nearly too much to believe. She had gone from girl to child and back again, but that was under some really strange circumstances, now her mama said she had done the same, but had done so willingly.<p>She watched as the tears finally began to flow, moving slowly down Michiru's face to drip off her chin. Even now though Michiru was silent, trying to remain strong in the face of the rejection she clearly expected. Hotaru didn't know what to make of the story. She knew that it was going to take some time for it to really sink in. The one thing that she did know is that her mama was hurting, one of the few people to ever love her wholeheartedly was terrified that her daughter was going to hate her.<p>Knowing that words were going to fail her Hotaru did the one thing that she could . . . she pulled her mama into tight hug and held on as she felt her mama shudder as she cried, even now doing her best to remain silent and in control . . . trying and failing for once to do so.. There was still a lot that she wanted to know, and despite how desperately she wanted to ask questions Hotaru knew that now wasn't the time. Her mama had promised to tell her the whole story later, and her mama never broke her word.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma felt her control slipping as she talked. She could see the confusion in her daughter's eyes, and she couldn't bear to look into those purple eyes any longer. She didn't want to actually see the moment Hotaru's confusion turned to disgust the disgust to anger. Ranma cursed her weakness, her fear, but even her iron will failed and she just couldn't make herself meet her daughter's eyes as she waited for the hurtful words to come . . . waited for Hotaru to tell her she wasn't . . . couldn't be her mama any more.<p>"Mama," her daughters voice was ever so soft and hesitant, and broke before she could utter more than a single word.<p>Ranma flinched as she waited for the words she so dreaded to hear. Instead she heard Hotaru's voice trail and moments later felt Hotaru's presence as her daughter enveloped her in an embrace that was both strong and gentle at the same time. Ranma clung to her daughter drawing comfort from the embrace . . . if the gesture was any indication at least her daughter still cared and wasn't going to reject her.<p>Ranma felt more than saw Washu get up, and softly pad away. The last words she heard from the diminutive genius was the message that she would leave the two alone and when they were ready to leave all they had to do was call out and she would return. Hotaru answered, what she said Ranma didn't know, her mind was to wrapped up in her fears and worries to even care. Then they were alone, and Hotaru held her, held on and didn't let go. Ranma could feel herself shaking, could feel the pain searching for release, but the sobs were held inside by will alone as she tried to draw comfort from her daughters embrace. It helped . . . but the fear of rejection still clawed deeply in her soul, and even her daughter's love failed to completely dislodge its hold on her soul.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Washu cursed softly as she left the two hurting women alone. For once she cursed the curiosity that was (usually) such a gift. If she had known that Michiru was keeping her past a secret from even her own family she would've found another way . . . but she hadn't and the damage was done. In her own excitement, in her own triumph at finding the hidden secrets the other redhead possessed, she had erred, and had done so badly. Now all she could do was hope that things turned out well despite her interference.<p>Exiting her lab the scientist saw the expectant eyes of Nodoka and the curious eyes of the others. They had obviously returned from the sparring match, when she didn't know, but here they were and eagerly waiting for an update as to her patient's condition.<p>Nodoka and Katsuhito looked tired but happy, the rest looked shocked as if they had run into yet another surprise in a day filled with surprises. Tenchi and the girls kept shooting sly glances at the older pair, glances that spoke of hidden humor.<p>"What's up Washu-chan?" Tenchi broke the silence first, as Nodoka was too nervous to do so.<p>"Michiru and Hotaru are awake. They will need a few minutes to talk then they'll be right out."<p>"Awake!" the Masaki girls sang in chorus.<p>"I thought you said they wouldn't be awake until tomorrow," Ayeka was the first to recover from her surprise.<p>"I did say that didn't I?" Washu grinned impudently. "Well thanks to my genius and the healing tanks I designed they recovered faster than usual."<p>"Michiru did always heal quickly," Katsuhito noted.<p>"Yes she did," Nodoka chimed in proudly. "When can I see my daughter?"<p>"They should be ready to come out in a bit. I'm not sure how long it will take as they were deep in conversation when I left," Washu advised. "To be honest I wouldn't be surprised if little Hotaru isn't in a bit of trouble. I don't think her mother knew she was coming."<p>Nodoka nodded, "And if I know my daughter's temper, Hotaru will be lucky to escape being grounded if she disobeyed her." Nodoka's grin took on a stellar glow as she realized that Michiru was going to be fine, the glow only magnified as she was going to finally meet her daughter's own adopted child. Impossibly the already radiant expression brightened yet a third time now that Nodoka no longer had to worry about her daughter's condition.  Now the worry had been replaced with one thought, "Grandchildren". She had nearly despaired of ever being a grandmother . . . and now she was.<p>"Would anyone like some tea while we wait?" the ever-practical Sasami asked. The rest of the occupants looked like bobble-head dolls at the thought of enjoying the young princess's tea, for with tea came home-made snacks and Sasami was a domestic goddess in the kitchen. Seeing the nods the aqua haired girl bustled into the kitchen to prepare tea and snacks.<p>"So, Katsuhito," Washu's eyes twinkled with undisguised glee. "Did you have fun with Nodoka today?"<p>Nodoka blushed like a schoolgirl as she caught the implications in the young scientist's words.<p>"Washu-chan, we but sparred today and then had tea," Nodoka stammered.<p>Her interest in the eldest Masaki was betrayed by the guilty gleam in her eyes, and the color that found it's way into her cheeks. A sight that none of the others missed.<p>Katsuhito's answer was more restrained, as the eldest Masaki simply smiled, then softly added. "It was good to see her again."<p>Tenchi and the girls exchanged knowing looks. While the answer was low key it hinted at what they had begun to suspect, but what they also knew better than to openly state. Normally Katsuhito would've either replied with a martial arts witticism or perhaps a sly innuendo as he did so often when confronting the girls. This answer, which fit neither of his usual patterns spoke of deep feelings, feelings that perhaps even the Grandmaster of the Masaki Art didn't know he had.<p>Before the situation could become even more embarrassing to the couple, young Sasami returned with a tray loaded with goodies and the conversation turned to other things, safer things.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Akane, could you get the door please?" Kasumi's ever-cheerful voice wafted out from her small kingdom.<p>The eldest Tendo was in the middle of fixing supper and didn't want to leave the food she was preparing. When no answer came, Kasumi sighed and turned the fire down under the burners. If it didn't take to long to deal with their visitor nothing would be ruined. Indeed, to be truthful she was probably the only one who would be able to tell that something was "off" unless she actually burnt something. Still it would be nice if someone else would occasionally help her out a bit. Since Ranma had left it seemed that all life had drained from the Tendo home.<p>Kasumi glided out of the kitchen on her way to the door, a miniscule frown making the already attractive woman look even cuter. Uncle Genma and her Father were sitting at the gaming table, ignoring everything but each other and the board. The reason for that of course, is that either or both would take ruthless advantage of the other should their concentration waiver. Nabiki was upstairs, Akane . . . well her youngest sibling was sitting on the couch staring listlessly at the television.<p>"Akane, Akane, AKANE!" each time she spoke her words were just a bit louder and more forceful.<p>The last attempt apparently worked as Akane jumped, startled out of her reverie.<p>"What is it Onee-chan?"<p>"Akane, would you please get the door for me? I'm in the middle of cooking supper and I need to get back to check on things."<p>Akane's reply was rather feeble, and her smile even more so, but in response to her sister's request stood and padded over to the door quietly opening it. A young woman with black hair pulled up into a bun stood there, an impatient frown on her face. The annoyed expression quickly morphed into a professional, (if impersonal) smile when the door opened.<p>"May I help you?"<p>"I hope so," the woman replied with a tired smile. "I've got a package here for one Saotome Genma. Does he live here?"<p>"Akane nodded, "Yes he does. Shall I get him or can I sign for it?"<p>"He needs to sign for it," the woman answered briskly. "It's from a lawyer's office."<p>Akane frowned and felt the stirrings of anger. What had the baka-panda done now? Undoubtedly it was trouble . . . unfortunately trouble for Genma normally meant trouble Ranma . . . and for the Tendos as well. The youngest Tendo fought back the pain that this last thought brought her. Why should she care about the Baka anyway? He'd left her . . . three months and no word had come from him. It was only now that Akane realized just how much she cared for him.<p>She turned and hollered into the depths of the house. "Genma, there's a package for you."<p>"You can wait inside, he will be here in a moment," she finished, turning her attention back to the delivery-woman.<p>A few moments later Saotome Genma shuffled into view. It was amazing what three months without his son had done to the martial artist. Where once his very presence filled the area with his loud and boisterous presence, now he was a shrunken remnant of that man. He had seen the one dream he had held for so many years turn to smoke and fade away, destroyed by the one he had used and abused so often.<p>Akane sniffed disdainfully, and then glared feeling the familiar comfort of anger as she surveyed the father of her one-time fiancée. Even anger had lost its allure however and she couldn't hold the feeling for long. Shaking her head the girl moved listlessly back to the couch and her television program, once more sinking into the lethargy that had overtaken her since her last angry encounter with Ranma.<p>Akane's emotions were a muddled mess and she herself wasn't much better. Part of her was relieved that Ranma was gone, for when he went so did the pressure to get married, so did the madness and chaos that surrounded his life. Even now the youngest Tendo wasn't sure how to handle his absence. She had cared for him . . . had maybe even loved him. She could admit that to herself now that he was gone, now that she had time to think without being interrupted by the problems that followed him around.<p>Even though she admitted (at least to herself) that she loved Saotome Ranma, part of her still wondered if they could've made a marriage work. For all their love, part of her just couldn't trust him. Akane didn't know if she ever could . . . and one of the foundations of a good marriage was trust.<p>Still another part of her admitted that some of the problems were indeed her fault. She had always been quick to assume the worst when she was dealing with the pig-tailed boy. Now that he was gone (and the constant chaos with him) she found herself remembering the times that they had together. She remembered how she had been so quick to assume that "Neko- Ranma" would've kissed anyone, and that their first kiss had been nothing more than an accident. She remembered how she would take Ryouga's side and how she always assumed that Ranma was at fault for their fights. Yes, now that he was gone she could admit that sometimes it was Ryouga's fault they fought. She could admit that part of the problems were of her own making.<p>Yet not all of them were. Ranma had been so infuriating in his indecision and his immaturity. True, part of that was due to having only one example when growing up . . . and hardly a sterling one at that. Genma was a great martial artist, but he was a piss-poor man in many ways. Still there was no doubt that things could've gone differently had they both tried harder.<p>Part of her desperately wanted him back. For all his faults he had been there for her whenever things were the worst. On the other hand, many of the problems she had encountered were a direct result of him coming into her life. Yet on a third hand, (Akane ruefully grinned at the number of hands she was using) several were not. It was her father's foolishness that had created a lot of the problems she had with the "princes" and others who had made her life such a nightmare.<p>Akane sighed. She wasn't sure what to think. One thing was certain, Ranma had made a major impact on her life. He was her first love, and even with the problems he brought she had felt things in his presence that she had never felt with anyone else<p>Still he had run off, he was gone and showed no signs of coming back. She had been shocked when he left and didn't return. They had had their fights before and always before the Baka came back . . . but this time he didn't. The fact that he had run, the fact that he had not been restrained by his honor still amazed her.<p>Her life had definitely taken a different turn since he left. The "other fiancées" had given her a hard time at first, and still did when their paths crossed. She could handle that pressure though.<p>Kuno Kodachi was the worst, but Akane didn't fear the crazed gymnast. She had learned a lot while Ranma was here. True she never came close to matching his abilities, but still she had learned. Ukyo was mad . . . or perhaps furious was a better word to describe their relationship now, but as mad as the spatula wielding martial artist was, she had never threatened Akane. Shampoo was perhaps the biggest surprise of all. Once it became clear that Ranma was indeed gone, she had simply ignored Akane . . . her only comment was that it was about time that her "Arien" had left "violent girl." Their paths seldom crossed. Indeed other than checking in from time to time to see if Ranma had returned Shampoo hadn't even bothered her, choosing to spend her time searching for Ranma instead.<p>Still lost in her thoughts Akane barely registered the conversation behind her and didn't even hear the door open and close as the courier made her delivery and left. The sound of rustling paper and of a package being open never penetrated the haze her mind was in . . . until Genma let out a rather shocked yell.<p>Akane jumped and turned to look at her fiancée's father, (if she could still call him that). Genma's face was shocked, an expression that soon manifested on Akane's face as well. Genma was holding a letter . . . and the scabbard that once held the Saotome honor blade.<p>"What the . . . "Genma looked at the empty scabbard with puzzled eyes, then looking closer he pulled a folded piece of paper from it.<p>His heart nearly stopped as he recognized the yellowed piece of paper. It was that damned seppuku contract. Then he realized she had returned it to him, but why in the empty scabbard of her katana. Genma looked blankly at the faded document before seeing the ink patters on the back the newer ink showing through. Turning the document over he read Nodoka's words with disbelief.<p>"She's . . . she's divorced me," Genma sputtered. "Nodoka has renounced the Saotome name and is now ronin, and she pawned the Saotome Clan katana."<p>"She WHAT?" Akane found herself yelling.<p>"Nodoka took her name off the Clan registry . . . her's and Ranma's as well," Genma's voice was dazed as he looked at the documents he held, and the scabbard that had been delivered with them. "She said that my promises of honor are as empty as this scabbard and that unlike my honor which I sold so cheaply I can at least redeem the family sword."<p>"Oh my," Kasumi's voice echoed from her place at the kitchen door.<p>Silence reigned for several moments before being broken by an ice-cold whisper.<p>"So Saotome, it looks like they are finally free of you doesn't it," Nabiki's voice broke the stillness.<p>"What . . . what does it say about Ranma?" Akane whispered, torn between hope that she would finally find her missing love, and the fear that the madness would start again.<p>"Nothing," Genma answered absently his mind still in shock and not yet working after reading the note Nodoka had penned. "She just removed both of them from the registry. It doesn't say anything about a new Clan or where he is."<p>"Does Aunty Nodoka know where Ranma is," Nabiki asked, her eyes gleaming and her voice carrying undertones of concern and something else that none of the others could quite pin down.<p>"The last time I asked her all she said was that Ranma was gone and wasn't coming back," Genma answered brokenly.<p>"So nothing new as far as where Ranma is," Nabiki pressed.<p>"Nothing," the Saotome patriarch answered softly, "Nothing."<p>Nabiki frowned, she still hoped that she would be able to find him. Part of her hoped he would turn up.<p>Nabiki knew that it was probably to later for her to have what she really wanted. But then again she'd never really had him as anything other than a friend. A friend she hadn't recognized until it was to late. She had hoped that she could find her friend again but each passing day lessened that hope, and she didn't have so many friends that she could just lose one. She and Ranma might not ever be more than friends, but at least she was smarter than Ukyo. If all he wanted was friendship that she would offer him and gladly. He was one of the few to ever accept her as she was, and that acceptance meant the world to her.<p>Nabiki let her shoulders droop and headed back to her room. It was good to see the panda finally get what was coming to him, but even that left a cold emptiness in her soul. She missed Ranma and revenge, even so sweet as this was didn't fill the place in her heart that he had occupied. He was her friend and she missed him.<p>"Where did I go wrong," Genma moaned. In a flash his despair turned to anger as Nodoka's words finally sank in.<p>His shock rapidly turned to volcanic anger and he continued snarling. "That ungrateful bitch . . .how dare she . . . that bitch and the boy are ruining my life."<p>"Uncle Genma," Kasumi uncharacteristically snapped her voice laced with vitriol. "I will NOT allow you to call Aunty Nodoka names. You have no one to blame but yourself . . . you and your fat stomach. If I hear you talking about Aunty like that again you can do your own cooking, cleaning and laundry for I shall not. I will not stand for you saying or doing anything else to her or poor Ranma."<p>The others looked in shock at the normally meek and mild woman they so often took for granted. The glare she fixed Genma with could probably blast through the armored hull of a main battle tank. The warm smile and somewhat vacant expression that normally adorned her face was gone, leaving in its place an expression of disgust and distaste that seemed foreign to her gentle features. . Kasumi spoke not another word as she turned and headed back into the kitchen. Behind her she left Nabiki with a shocked and yet somehow respectful expression on her cold features, Genma wordlessly fuming and her little sister Akane gasping from shock like a fish out of water. There were some things that Kasumi knew that even she couldn't put to right . . . and she knew better than to even try.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Are you ready for this daughter?" Nodoka asked looking down at Michiru's smaller frame.<p>Nodoka smiled slightly. It seemed so strange to think of Michiru as Ranma.  After all she'd grown up around the quiet girl. She'd spent years watching her grow and learn, had seen her turn from a tomboyish young girl into a lady. Indeed she had more than a little hand in the transformation herself. The years she'd never had with Ranma she had spent with Michiru pouring her heart out to the young orphan girl. Somehow it seemed more natural to think of her child as Michiru rather than as Ranma.<p>It had been hard, those two years when Ranma was at the Tendos. It had been hard to watch has her son experienced hell on earth, a hell that caused her to become Michiru. Yet even so another part of her was glad. She had been able to be there for Michiru as she had never been able to be with her son. However there was one thing the older woman knew without a doubt. Legal name or not, Michiru was as much (if not more) her daughter than she was the Kaiou's child. Michiru was her life . . . and she didn't regret it for an instant.<p>"I believe so mama?" Michiru answered firmly. "Do you think Happosai will keep his word?"<p>Nodoka paused, considering her daughter's question, absently caressing the katana by her side, comforted by its presence, as she had never been comforted by the Saotome honor blade she had carried for so long. That blade had been tainted by the seppuku promise she had signed with Genma. That blade had embodied her worst fears and nightmares, yet she had carried that burden for so long because honor demanded it.<p>It was strange really. Genma had never been interested in the art of the sword even though he came from an old samurai family. Indeed he had detested weapons and looked down upon those who used them. With the wisdom of hindsight Nodoka wondered if perhaps his distaste for weapons was due to his own lack of real honor. After all one who truly followed the code of the samurai held honor and duty above all else . . . while Genma put himself before any code of honor. He had shown his shallow, greedy nature all to often. The result of his foolish greed had been to create a situation for their son that made preserving his honor nearly impossible. Even now she doubted that she really understood the pressure that Michiru had been under when she was Ranma.<p>This blade on the other hand was originally from her own clan, that of Clan Isagomo, but it had been part of House Masaki for generations now. She and Katsuhito had just finished sparring when he asked her to accompany her to the shrine for tea and a bit of conversation. She had suspected nothing, thinking he wanted to talk about Michiru and the events that had transpired today. He had, and they had talked of their joint student, but the conversation hadn't ended there.<p>After they finished their tea he had gone into the back of the shrine and when he returned he had been carrying two pairs of blades. The first he offered to her as a gift, a matched set of blades that she carried even now.<p>They were swords of the highest quality, true representations of the sword maker's art. Crafted in the old style, they were of the best folded-steel flawless and strong. The craftsmanship of the scabbards and accoutrements was of the same level. She had tried to refuse the gift telling her sensei that she was nothing more than a ronin and did not deserve such fine blades.<p>Nodoka smiled as she recalled his response. Sensei Masaki had laughed gently and told her that he knew of one clan that would be more than willing to take her in. She blushed as she recalled her first reaction to his statement, for the briefest of moments she had thought he was . . . .  Shaking her head to clear it of those thoughts she sighed. He had offered her a name, and she had accepted.<p>Then he had told her the history of the blades he offered. They were the blades carried by her ancestor Funaho, once of the Isagomo Clan and then of House Jurai. His house, Katsuhito had said, and the Clan that the Masaki's claimed by kin ties, one that didn't appear on any registry and one (that if her daughter's suspicions were true) never would.<p>Katsuhito had not revealed everything, and when pressed had simply stated that it was not yet time for that story to be told, but he had confirmed that Funaho was his direct ancestor and stressed that she would surely be honored to have one such as Nodoka to carry them now. In the face of his assertions, (and to be honest her love for the blades he offered) she had consented.<p>To her surprise Katsuhito had gone on to say that he intended to present the other blades to Michiru as a gift as well, a celebration of her skill and what she had achieved in learning the art of the sword. He had confided in her still further and told her that they were blades he had carried in his youth.<p>Though they were rather plain to look at, still something about them drew her eyes. It was as if they were special . . . as if they had a destiny yet unfulfilled.<p>"Mama?" Are you okay?"<p>"Yes daughter I am fine. I was just thinking about the blades Sensei gifted me with today."<p>"That Sensei Masaki gifted you with, or that Masaki Katsuhito gifted you with? They are such a lovely gift, and a gift like that to a samurai-ko such as yourself . . . "<p>Nodoka heard the teasing in her daughter's voice.<p>"Now Michiru. It was nothing like that."<p>"Are you sure mama? I mean he is taking you into the Masaki Clan."<p>Nodoka couldn't prevent the blush that her daughter's teasing comments brought.<p>"Maybe he intends to bring you fully into the Clan later? Perhaps more directly into the main family line?" Michiru's voice contained more than a bit of laughter as she teased her mother.<p>"That's enough Michiru," Nodoka scolded. "Kat . . . Sensei is much older than me you know."<p>"I know mama." Michiru continued, her eyes dancing as she caught the slip of her mother's tongue.<p>Nodoka didn't miss the mischievous glance her "daughter" shot her, nor could she fight down the shiver that Michiru's words brought. It was true that she had quite the crush on her sensei when she was younger, in that oh so innocent time before Saotome Genma. It was also true that he was still a fine figure of a man, even if he were truly old enough to be her father.<p>"Besides,"<p>"Michiru that's enough,"<p>"Gee mama. I was just going to say that with his level of ki control he'd probably be around and in good health for a long, long time."<p>Though the words were innocent in and of themselves Nodoka couldn't help but consider what Michiru was saying . . . and if there was one thing that was definitely true about Masaki Nodoka if she wanted something she would try her best to get it come hell or high water, and she would pay the cost of her actions whatever they may be. She had willingly paid the price to be with Genma. What more would she be willing to pay for someone . . .<p>"Am I interrupting anything?" Masaki Katsuhito asked as he made his way toward the two softly conversing women.<p>"Nothing of importance Sensei," Michiru answered for the both of them. "Did Washu-chan say how much longer it would be before Happosai was going to be up and around?"<p>"Washu said that she would bring him out in about five minutes. Then another five minutes for him to wake up."<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Masaki Katsuhito watched as he approached his former students. Michiru and Nodoka were conversing quietly as they knelt by the table. It was clear that something was going on to judge from the way they looked. His finely tuned instincts were screaming at him as he watched them talk. He wasn't sure what it was they were talking about, but he didn't think it was about Happosai or the meeting they were going to have with the old master in a few minutes.<p>Michiru looked more relaxed than he had seen her since her arrival. Nodoka on the other hand looked a bit flustered and perhaps more than a bit nervous.<p>"Nodoka's still beautiful, and her daughter the same," Katsuhito noted absently as he padded toward them.<p>The Shrine Priest fought the urge to slap himself on the forehead as he considered his thoughts. Nodoka was just a child to him, of course most full-blooded earthlings were. Not only that she was the same age as his daughter Achika. Still, he had to admit that she was an amazing woman, and one that had been alone for nearly as long a time as he had.<p>"Dammit, I'm old enough to be her father," Katsuhito forcefully reminded himself, "and she knows it too. After all this was nearly her second home when she was a child. She and Achika were the best friends and nearly inseparable until her untimely death. Somehow the words didn't bring the peace of mind that he was searching for. Katsuhito decided he'd better get down to business before his mind teased him with more impossibilities.<p>"Am I interrupting anything?" Masaki Katsuhito asked as he made his way toward the two softly conversing women.<p>"Nothing of importance Sensei," Michiru answered for the both of them. "Did Washu-chan say how much longer it would be before Happosai was going to be up and around?"<p>Katsuhito didn't miss the looks he received from the women in front of him.  Michiru was looking at him with an expression more suited to a cat considering a mouse than the respectful gaze of a student to her honored sensei. Nodoka on the other hand was blushing and looking anywhere other than at him, suddenly finding something of great interest on the floor near her feet.<p>Feeling much like the mouse he had just thought of, Katsuhito answered the question, and quickly followed it with questions of his own about how the meeting with Happosai was going to be conducted.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"So Happosai, are you ready to sign my license?" Ranma asked, her voice sweet, and sugary enough to make a dentist's eyes fill up with yen signs. The dulcet tones hardened as she continued. "Or do you have so little honor that you are going to welsh on our bargain?"<p>Happosai groaned as he looked around at the implacable eyes of Ranma's companions. Nodoka said nothing, but the gleam in her eye and the way she caressed the katana at her side, told the old letch that she would like nothing more than to puree him if he gave her son any problems. Happosai wasn't sure where she obtained the weapon, as it was clearly not the Saotome honor sword. Yes indeed, it was easy to see that there was much more going on here than met the unobservant eye.<p>"Nodoka, I see that you no longer carry the Saotome sword," Happosai's opening gambit was to lead with a question.<p>"No, and I shall never bear it again. I have divorced Genma and have joined House Masaki," Nodoka answered shortly.<p>Happosai schooled his features to impassivity. This was a surprise. She had put up with that idiot Genma for nearly twenty years. What had happened to cause the break? Was it something to do with Ranma? Given her adherence to duty it nearly had to be, but what? What had happened to the boy over the last three months?<p>"I see," he answered shortly.<p>"And why is your presence needed here?" Happosai stopped filling his pipe to point the stem at Masaki Katsuhito.<p>The Shrine Priest was more restrained, his face giving nothing away. However Happosai wasn't deceived. He hadn't been around for three hundred years for nothing. Masaki Katsuhito was no one to fool around with. Happosai thought he could take the sword-master even with his ki reserves nearly depleted . . . if he got the first strike in. A fair fight was another matter. Even fully healed he wasn't sure if he could take the priest, and right now the smart money would be on the other in any confrontation. That didn't even take into consideration Ranma . . . him . . . or was that herself?<p>"As one of the judges I am here to see that the terms of the wager are adhered to," Katsuhito answered firmly. "I am sure that my presence will be unnecessary as honor demands that you do as you promised."<p>Happosai frowned as he took a moment to light his pipe in an effort to buy more time to figure out what was going on. Something wasn't quite right here and he knew it. Ranma normally stayed in his cursed form as little as possible, changing back into a boy with the nearest available hot water. Yet here today he had not only started out in "girl-form" but was even now still in it, and apparently by choice as there was a pot of tea sitting right in front of her even now. Not only was he in girl form but Nodoka was saying nothing about it. Once she had discovered that Ranko and Ranma were one and the same she was usually among the first to offer him hot water to change back into her son.<p>The old martial artist cursed his aching head as he pulled on his ki reserves for healing. It would appear that whoever had treated their wounds after the fight had completely healed Ranma, but had not done the same for him. He wasn't sure what exactly had gone on, the last thing he remembered before waking on the Masaki's couch was a blow to his head. Combined with the abuse that he had taken during the fight it was no wonder he felt like something that not even a cat would drag in. Yet Ranma appeared to be completely healed. Happosai knew of several techniques that would allow such rapid healing, but it took a master healer to perform them, not even he could do so easily.<p>True he healed incredibly fast, but not that fast. To heal faster than he was already doing he needed ki and right now he was tapped out, empty, drained. It would have helped if he could cop a feel on one of the ladies present, or even better do so and liberate some silky darlings . . . but he couldn't. One of the conditions he had agreed to before the fight was to leave Ranma and his friends alone, and that obviously included the girls here at the shrine. Even if it hadn't Happosai wasn't sure he would have tried given his weakened condition . . . and the amazingly powerful aura's he could sense from all of those in the Masaki household.<p>"Boy," Happosai began, "I gave my word and despite what you think of me I keep my word," he frowned at the somewhat disbelieving looks that Ranma and Nodoka shot his way.<p>"Give the devil his due boy. Name one time I gave my word and then backed out on it."<p>Happosai watched carefully as Ranma considered his words. The nod of affirmation he received was grudgingly given, but given nonetheless.<p>"That's true old man. You might be a pervert. You might twist your words in ways that Nabiki only dreamed of, but once you actually give your word you carry it though . . . at least in a manner of speaking." Ranma admitted. "You just usually set terms and conditions that are next to impossible to meet."<p>A wry grin broke across Ranma's face. "You promised Taro that you'd change his name, but always conditioned it on defeating me . . . and he never did, or at least never well enough to do everything you asked him to do."<p>"Quite right my boy." Happosai answered smugly.<p>Then with a grudging tone of his own the Grandmaster of Anything Goes continued. "I was surprised that you covered the loopholes as well as you did before the match."<p>"I tried Happosai. Now are you going to sign or not?"<p>"Are you sure you don't want me to teach you the true secrets of Anything Goes. I have techniques and moves that none of my other students were ever shown." Happosai avoided a direct answer as he asked a question of his own, a question he both anticipated and dreaded the answer to.<p>Even as he spoke Happosai studied his opponents. There might not be a physical confrontation looming, but the perverted martial arts master wasn't going to give up on his heir so easily. He hadn't taken the time prior to the match to really take a good look at the witnesses or observers. Happosai shook his head, he hated to admit it but he had been way to cocky and sure of himself to do so before. He had been positive that even a prodigy like Ranma couldn't learn enough in the three short months he was gone to beat him in a fight. Yet somehow he had.<p>"I would like to learn them it is true," Ranma answered, "But only on my terms and conditions. The terms and conditions that I stated before our little duel."<p>Once more Happosai shook his head. There was definitely something amiss. Ranma was never this sharp. Sure he had potential. Happosai had known all along that Ranma wasn't the stupid jock that he appeared to be. But until now all that potential was just that . . . potential. Ranma had been woefully ignorant of anything outside of martial arts. Yet now he was speaking like an advanced juku student. What was even stranger was that he was using proper feminine speech patterns. What had happened to the boy over the last three months? Something wasn't adding up and Happosai wanted to know why.<p>"But Ranma," Happosai whined, "Why begrudge your old grandfather a few pleasures in his old age?"<p>"It's not going to work old man. You either abide by the terms of the bet or you disappear and leave me the Hell alone," Ranma flared, her eyes turning flint hard and as cold as glacial ice.<p>"Don't get your panties in a knot boy. I already said I'd keep by end of the bargain."<p>"Just so Master Happosai," Katsuhito broke his silence. "I have the certificate right here for you to sign."<p>Wordlessly Happosai took the proffered document and looked it over. The ancient master felt his eyebrows rise involuntarily as he looked it over.<p>"What's going on here boy? This says that I'm licensing a girl by the name of Kaiou Michiru."<p>"You are," Ranma replied evenly, a small cold smile adorning her face.<p>"But . . . but a girl? You are going to stay a girl?"<p>Happosai couldn't have been more surprised than if he had seen Saotome Genma pass up a free meal. What in the world was going on with the boy? There were only four constants in the train wreck that Ranma called his life. The first was that his father was an ass who would take advantage of him at every opportunity. The second was Ranma's ability to attract women without even trying. The third was Ranma's never say die and never accept defeat attitude. The fourth and most definite was that Ranma would never . . . ever accept his curse. After all even Genma occasionally missed an opportunity to sell out his son, and once every blue moon there would be a woman who had absolutely no interest in the boy . . . or at least one who never expressed an interest in him. But to accept the curse? Once again Happosai wondered just what the HELL had happened to Ranma over the last three months.<p>Taking a closer look at his heir Happosai did a deep ki scan and nearly fell from his chair. RANMA'S KI WAS THAT OF A WOMAN! Not a trace of male ki showed anywhere in HER aura.<p>"Something wrong Happosai?" Ranma (or was that Michiru) questioned softly and not without traces of malice in her sugary tones.<p>"What have you done Ranma?" Happosai sputtered. "Your ki, its . . . its . . . "he trailed off.<p>"Female?" Ranma questioned meeting his eyes with an ever so innocent look in her sparkling blue eyes.<p>"Ye . . . yes," Happosai managed after a few moments of stunned disbelief.<p>"It's simple," Ranma paused for effect, mischief shining clearly in her pixyish face. "I locked the curse."<p>Ranma shrugged a moment before continuing. "It seemed the only way out. I couldn't satisfy everyone's honor while I was still Ranma. The curse wasn't going to be cured, and I had to take control of my life. I was tired of being at the mercy of water."<p>Ranma took a sip of her now cold tea. "I was a freak, and changing sex at the drop of a glass or when it decided to rain was Hell. It's better this way, at least I'm in control."<p>"But . . . but,"<p>"It was my choice and mine alone."<p>"Even that wouldn't explain how your ki changed so rapidly."<p>"That's on a need to know basis and right now you don't need to know old man," Ranma replied nonchalantly, yet with the hint of steel in her soft tones.<p>Happosai frowned, then turned his attention back to the teaching certificate in front of him. With a flourish he signed his name, stamped it with his mark and handed the document back to Masaki Katsuhito.<p>"There it's done,"<p>Turning toward his former student and still hoped for heir the Grandmaster of Anything Goes continued. "Ran . . . Michiru, I would still like for you to be the heir to the school. If I agree to your terms would you be willing to accept the position of heir to the complete school of Anything Goes?"<p>Happosai waited anxiously for his student's response. He had a lot riding on this. In all his three hundred years he had never had a student like . . . Michiru. Genma and Soun had potential, potential they squandered like kids blowing their allowance on candy or video games, but even their potential was dwarfed by that of the young . . . girl . . . sitting in front of her.<p>"It'll be a cold . . . "Michiru started to speak then paused her sapphire eyes boring into the anxious old eyes of the Grandmaster. "I will consider it. If you can keep your word I would like to do so," she finally answered.<p>Happosai let out the breath that he didn't even realize he was holding.<p>"Michiru, I give you my word as a martial artist. I won't say that I might not lapse on occasion . . . "Seeing the anger flaring in her, ever so expressive, blue eyes he hastened to continue. "But I promise this. If I do falter I will apologize . . . and I will make amends."<p>"In that case Happosai we will see," Ranma, no Michiru answered, then her tone hardened once again. "But if you bother my friends or family . . . "she let her voice trail off, the threat as obvious as a bull in a china shop even if it were unspoken.<p>"Will you be at the Tendos if I want to get in touch with you."<p>Happosai nodded. "If I am not there Kasumi will be able to pass along the message. But how are you going to handle Genma and Soun?"<p>"I've got a plan for that," the red haired girl answered softly and with eerie finality.<p>"Well my bo . . . girl," Happosai corrected himself. "I'll be off. I hope to hear from you soon."<p>The others only nodded and watched as the diminutive old pervert bounded off.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma looked at the scroll she held in her hand. So much had been ventured in the attempt to get this scroll. Has she been foolish? Was this little piece of paper, even with what it represented worth the risk . . . was it worth possibly losing her family? It had been a gamble and only time would tell whether she had beat the house or gone bust.<p>"Michiru are you sure you want to talk to Ryouga today as well?"<p>Ranma's musings were interrupted by her mama's voice.<p>"Hai . . . yes mama I'm sure,"<p>"Why did you have Washu-chan heal him completely when you didn't have her do the same for Happosai?"<p>Nodoka faltered as she looked into her daughters frozen orbs. The ferocity, the anger contained therein was tightly leashed, but present all the same.<p>"I don't want him to have any excuses when we settle this," Ranma's voice was soft, but her companions could literally feel the chill in the air as she spoke. "This is going to be his last chance. No one hurts my family," the last words were literally hissed and so cold they could cut.<p>"No one hurts my family," Ranma repeated. "Let us go "converse" with Ryouga."<p>A/N – a couple of reviews have made it clear that some people are confused as to why Happosai didn't know about the changes - I can see why from the hints in prior chapters – without giving away (hopefully) any future info - - rest assured it wasn't a mistake – let's just say it this way - what Happosai didn't know he was missing he couldn't miss - and the arranged duel was after Ranma lost one prior to his disappearance – in some ways this story is a result of Plan A (beating Happosai) not working
