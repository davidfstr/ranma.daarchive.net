</div>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer<p>Forever the Tomboy Ch. 6 - Demons and Conversations Oh My<p>"Wow, that was fun," Ranma chirped happily as she walked with Haruka back toward their vehicle. "I haven't had a chance to cut loose like that in a while."<p>"Yeah," Haruka grunted noncommittally, apparently lost in her own thoughts.<p>For once semi-oblivious to her partner's mood, and still on an adrenaline high Ranma continued speaking. "I mean that thing wasn't really a challenge, but it was fast and could take quite a bit of damage."<p>"Yeah, so could the one we were fighting," again Haruka answered more than a little listlessly.<p>"You know, I'm torn between hoping that was just an isolated instance and between hoping we see some more." Ranma paused for a moment, lost in her recollection of the fight just past, before continuing somewhat more somberly. This time a hint of sadness touched her dulcet tones. "Though I wish we didn't have to worry about civilians. Why can't any of our enemies just show up and fight us before they go after people who can't defend themselves."<p>Though the question was mostly rhetorical Ranma asked it anyway. The adrenaline rush from the fight was still strong and Ranma was nearly dancing as she swayed seductively down the street. The blue haired woman was firmly and possessively clamped onto Haruka's right arm, enjoying the physical contact with the much taller woman, and quite frankly looking forward to contact of a much more intimate nature soon. It had always been that way for her, fighting made her feel more "alive" than virtually anything else. The only other things that held even a candle to the "rush" that fighting brought were playing her violin and playing her lover, and despite how much her skill with the violin meant to her, of the two she much preferred the instrument that was her lovers body. Oh how she loved to make Haruka sing. True the senshi of Uranus couldn't carry a tune in a bucket, heck her singing could make a tone deaf dog howl, but that certainly wasn't the kind of singing that she had in mind anyway. Ranma felt a full body blush coming on as she considered just how vocal Haruka could be when in the throes of passion, and as Ranma could personally attest . . . a woman certainly knew how to best please another woman.<p>"I don't know Michiru," Haruka responded, "Those things were disgusting, not to mention a lot more deadly than the youma, or other Negaverse abominations that we've run into before."<p>"Yeah," Ranma agreed, "but I don't think those were from the Negaverse. They felt . . . evil, truly evil. I think those might have been real demons." Ranma finished her sentence only half aware that she spoke aloud, her mind on things long past and evils she had vanquished before.<p>"Demons? What makes you think that?" Haruka exclaimed.<p>"Shit." Ranma thought, startled as her lover responded to words that she hadn't realized she had spoken aloud. How was she going to explain this? Ranma cursed her careless tongue as she pondered her reply. She was really going to have to watch her mouth. It was like part of the old Ranma had risen from the grave, called forth by her visit to Nerima to haunt her again. One thing was perfectly clear to the senshi of Neptune, she definitely didn't need her old "foot in mouth" problems to come back and trouble her new life. She was going to have to regain control over that most dangerous of organs and do so quickly.<p>"Did I say that out loud?" Ranma asked, but didn't wait for a reply before answering her own question. "I must have or you wouldn't have answered it."<p>Neptune took a moment to collect her thoughts. Damn, she was going to have to be careful here or she was going to end up spilling her guts to Haruka. While part of her really wanted to come clean, the vast majority of her didn't want to risk losing the blond tomboy. Just how would Haruka react to finding out about her true past . . . she didn't know and she was more than a little afraid of the probable answer to that question.<p>"Uhmmmm, would you believe I've run into a demon before?" she asked hesitantly, looking up into her lover's face.<p>"And just when was that?" Haruka asked none to gently.<p>"It was before Setsuna contacted me. Someone had a grudge against me and called a minor demon to show me the error of my ways," Ranma responded. "It was a really tough fight but I managed to fight it off."<p>The aqua tressed woman hid a smirk at her reply. What she said was true, it just wasn't quite all the truth. Indeed it left quite a bit out, and what was said contained more than a bit of misdirection. She didn't divulge the fact that Happosai had sent the demon after her boy side in retribution for "his" stopping the old lech during several of his panty raids and for refusing to let the geezer grope her girl side.<p>"And how did you do that?"<p>Ranma's inner smirk died a quick, but nonetheless painful death. It seemed that Haruka was still mad about her keeping secrets, if the icy tone of her question was to be believed. Not that she blamed the other woman, she'd probably be a bit steamed if the reverse were true, but she loved her tomboy so much that she was sure that she'd get over it . . . eventually. She'd managed to quell her jealousy over Haruka's prior lovers after all, true it had been, and often still was a struggle to do so, but she had . . . mostly . . . managed it. She just hoped Haruka could do the same and forgive her as well. Giving a small sigh Ranma realized that she finally knew how the "fiancé brigade" had felt when they saw "boy-Ranma" showing affection toward one of the other girls. Now she could only hope that Haruka's feelings were just as strong for her as hers were for the senshi of Uranus.<p>The silence grew even colder as Ranma searched for a "relatively" safe answer.<p>"Well, I'd been training for several years by then and managed to fight it off."<p>Once again the reply was true, so far as it went. He had managed to fight it off, but it was with the skills Genma had taught him, not the sword skills learned from her mother years later. Hopefully though, Haruka would assume it was "Azami" that was able to fend off a monster from hell and not pursue the matter further.<p>To her relief that seemed to be her lover's belief as the tuxedo clad woman asked no further questions. Unfortunately Haruka's silence indicated that this newest revelation had apparently brought Haruka's mind back to her initial issue, back to the "distrust" that Ranma had shown by keeping such a big secret.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Haruka?"<p>The blond in question glanced down at her shorter companion, the still tentative note in her lover's voice drawing her gaze. She was still stunned by the series of revelations that had come to light this night. What had started out as just another night out with her soul mate had taken a surrealistic turn, she half expected to hear Rod Sterling's voice speaking in the background, and Haruka didn't like that one little bit. The evening had taken her places she never dreamed she'd be and shown her things about her lover that she had never even suspected, not in her wildest imaginings would she have considered Michiru to be a world-class swordswoman, and it showed just how little she really knew about the blue- eyed woman's past. It also revived doubts in her mind as to the strength of their relationship. What other skeletons were in Michiru's past, what other disclosures were coming, and what would they do to their relationship? She had, in the past, been content to let the past stay in the past. Haruka knew that Michiru had a rather odd relationship with her adopted parents. There was love there true, but it was a distant kind of love more like polite respect than the love you would expect between a child and her parents.<p>There had always been hints of that, but Haruka had respected Michiru's privacy. What business was it really of hers that her lover and her parents were cool toward each other. Haruka knew Michiru was adopted. Michiru had confided in her that she often felt that her parents had adopted her as a "show-piece." They felt that having a daughter would be beneficial to them in their business to show the "completeness" of their family. They had taken great care to see that she was well educated and a "model child". They took pride in her musical accomplishments, after all having a prodigy only enhanced their own accomplishments in raising such a fine child, and gave them something to brag about to those they did business with.<p>Haruka also knew that they were less than pleased with Michiru's "leanings" in love. The few times she had met with them they had been pleasant, but cool in manner. At first Haruka thought that they were just naturally reserved, after all that was how Michiru herself appeared. There was little that could break through the façade she presented to the world. Yet, there was more to their reactions and Haruka had felt . . . unwelcome and uncomfortable in their presence. They had never done anything overtly insulting, but they had never really warmed up to her either. In the past she'd always shrugged it off. After all that was not an uncommon reaction on the part of her previous lover's parents so she had always assumed this was more of the same.<p>Still though, they hadn't disowned Michiru, they still provided her with a good income, and the trust set up in her name was enough to allow her to live in style without any worries so long as they didn't just blow the money, and as far as Haruka knew Michiru still stood to inherit a rather large fortune when they passed on. Haruka was pulled from her musings once again when Michiru spoke again.<p>"Haruka?"<p>"Yes, Michiru."<p>"You aren't mad at me are you?"<p>Haruka fought and beat, though it was a tough fight, a case of the giggles as they walked back to her waiting car. The plaintive, somewhat fearful, tone in her lover's voice pulled her back to the present, well that and the iron grip that Michiru had taken on her arm. Michiru's hold could be compared to that of a starfish clinging to an oyster shell . . . nearly unbreakable. This opportunity was just to good to pass up. She had Michiru just where she wanted her, well almost, where she actually wanted the sensuous woman was in bed, but this would do for now, and she was going to take full advantage of it. Tonight was going to be sooooo much fun.<p>"I'm afraid I am still a little upset," the tuxedo clad woman answered softly.<p>They were back in their "civilian" togs having transformed out of their senshi uniforms and into the formal evening wear that they had started the evening with. The night was lovely, the temperature crisp without being cold, the stars were scattered throughout the night sky. While the lights of Tokyo, concealed many of the dimmer stars, the ones that were out sparkled like diamonds against a black velvet sky, all in all a very romantic setting. Despite her lingering feelings of fear laced with some resentment that Michiru had concealed important parts of her background from her, Haruka fully intended to take advantage of her lover, errr the romantic situation that they were in.<p>She did however intend to make her "normally calm and in control" partner squirm some first, and it was realllyyyy a lot of fun when she had Michiru squirming. Haruka's mind quickly devolved into a series of rather pornographic and explicit series of scenes as she considered her options.<p>It really was a nice change to have Michiru feeling the need to make amends, to apologize and to seek forgiveness. Normally she was the one who messed up. Normally it was Michiru who teased and tormented HER for some word or deed that she had done (often completely unintentionally) and Michiru who put her through Hell until she was forgiven, but not this time.<p>Yes it did annoy the daylights out of her that Michiru had hidden her skills with the sword, and it frustrated her even more that Michiru knew her idol Saotome Nodoka and had never even bothered to let her know. Hell, from the way her lover referred to her sensei Nodoka was practically a second mother to her . . . and probably closer to her emotionally than her own parents were, and for whatever reason or reasons, Michiru hadn't even introduced them.<p>"Haruka, I'm sorry,"<p>Haruka's mind was pulled from her musings at the pleading tone and repeated apologies offered by her lover. In fact the senshi of Uranus felt a little bit of guilt at her lack of response. Michiru was obviously worried, and maybe even frightened that she wouldn't be forgiven. Haruka knew that wasn't the case, and though she knew what it felt like to be on the wrong end of one of their tiffs, Haruka was somewhat annoyed that Michiru would think that something like this would break them up. Didn't Michiru know just how much she loved her, or was there something deeper fueling the fear and worry that the normally impassive was so uncharacteristically showing. If Michiru had concealed this facet of her life was there still more hidden in the depths of her past, still more that might come between them and cause a rift that couldn't be healed so easily?<p>"I believe you Mi-chan. It's just that a lot has happened tonight. I'm still trying to get a handle on all of this."<p>"I am sorry Haruka. I wanted to tell you but . . ." Michiru trailed off. "I was just afraid you'd be really mad at me and . . ."<p>Haruka had finally had enough teasing, was one thing, but Michiru was obviously in real pain. She turned to the smaller woman and pulled her into a hug. Michiru responded with another Usagi-like glomp, pressing every inch of her smaller body against that of the taller woman. Michiru was holding her as if she was afraid that Haruka would disappear from her life and never return. To her surprise Haruka felt Michiru shaking as she fought back tears, trying to suppress her sobs as they held each other close.<p>"I'm sorry, I'm soo sorry," Michiru wailed, her voice filled with panic.<p>Amazement filled her as Haruka wondered at the strength of this fear . . . and it made her wonder still again why Michiru seemed so afraid, so insecure. It just wasn't like her to show such extreme emotion, to show such need.<p>"I know you are," Haruka held Michiru tightly stroking her lovers back reassuringly, ignoring the looks of the few pedestrians walking nearby. "It'll be alright. I just need some time to get used to the idea that you can fight like that. Hell it's going to take a lot of time to get used to the idea that you can outfight me, at least with a sword in your hands."<p>To her surprise this didn't seem to help as Michiru clung even more tightly to her, (if that were even possible), wailing even louder and burrowing deeper into the embrace. Haruka grunted and had to wonder at just how strong her lover was. As Michiru's grip tightened her ability to breath was diminished. In fact if Michiru didn't let up soon she was going to pass out!<p>Haruka leaned down and placed a light kiss on the top of her lover's head, taking a moment to savor the sweet fragrance of the bluish hair and the womanly scent of her lover's body.<p>"Of course you are going to have to show me just how sorry you are and how much you want my forgiveness," Haruka crooned, her voice definitely taking on a sultry tone.<p>"Anything, anything you want to do tonight," Michiru responded softly. "I love you so much, I'm just afraid you won't love me if . . ."<p>"Michiru. That's enough." Haruka growled interrupting the desperate rant. "I love you and Nothing is going to change that. Though if you keep questioning my love I might get a little upset."<p>She was relieved to see the panic draining from Michiru's expressive blue eyes as she finally looked up, and even more relieved to feel her lover relax the death grip she had around her waist.<p>"Nothing . . . ?" Michiru breathed softly, yet with growing hope.<p>"Nothing." Haruka affirmed.<p>Uranus heard Michiru mutter something, but the smaller woman's voice was so soft that even their close proximity didn't allow her to hear the words.<p>"So are we going dancing or not?" Haruka questioned, trying to get Michiru's mind off her fears for the moment as they continued to walk back to her car.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Dancing? No I think I'd rather do something else with the rest of the evening," Ranma responded with a feeling of relief. "Why don't we just go home?"<p>"Home" a word that meant so much to her, a word that she had felt might be slipping away. If Haruka left she would still have her house, that was hers and no-none could take it away, but she wouldn't have her home, and that was more important than any building, no matter how nice it was.<p>Ranma was mentally exhausted and probably looked like a wreck. She could see traces of her make-up on Haruka's tuxedo, and could feel the dampness in the fabric where her tears had soaked the garment. Tears, she had cried like a woman who feared she was being rejected, Saotome Ranma had cried, and surprisingly enough was not ashamed of that fact. In this life she still sought control over herself and her environment, she was normally self contained and strong, but she had also learned that there were times when tears helped, when it was alright to cry, something that HE had never known or learned as Ranma.<p>She had been worried that Haruka was still mad at her, and to be truthful the other woman probably was, but apparently she wasn't going to hold a grudge over it. Ranma's heart sang as she considered Haruka's words. "Nothing" just the sound and the certainty in Haruka's voice made her feel safe and warm. An overstatement it might be, but it at least provided her with hope for the future. Certain fears remained, what would Haruka say if she ever found out she had been a boy. A shudder rippled once again though her small frame as she considered that possibility, but instead of worrying she clung to the word. "Nothing" it was strange how just that word comforted her, it might prove false, but that too was in the future, a future she would hopefully never have to experience. Ranma had already put together a story covering her martial arts abilities, it was even true (if again misleading) and she desperately hoped the story would hold together so she could keep her last (and darkest) secrets from her lover.<p>Nonetheless, Ranma could expect tonight to be interesting and she wondered what games Haruka was going to want to play tonight and just how hentai Haruka would get. It still surprised her how much she enjoyed some of the role-playing Haruka had introduced her to. Maybe they'd try "samurai-ko and the maiden" Haruka always liked that one. Ranma had finally grown to accept, (and even to kinda enjoy) some of the "tools and toys" Haruka liked, though they still made her uncomfortable at times . . . yet she had promised to do whatever Haruka wanted tonight. One thing that hadn't changed was that Ranma always kept her word, as Michiru, she had just learned to give her word sparingly, and only after considering the consequences.<p>Ranma did however, have a feeling that once this weekend was over and other matters settled, that they were going to be making a trip over to mama Nodoka's house. She seriously doubted that Haruka would wait longer than Monday to finally meet her idol. That was okay with her though, especially now that mama knew that there might be a grandchild in the works soon. Ranma blushed, that was one conversation that had been, well . . . interesting to say the least. The look on Nodoka's face had been priceless when she had asked her permission to use Ranma's "seed" to have a baby with her lover Haruka. The shock on mama's face that she was not only willing to bear a child, but was anxious to do so, was something she'd never forget. The radiant glow that followed when Nodoka had ever so enthusiastically agreed would never fade from her mind either. Ranma's inner smile dimmed a bit though as she considered what her mother and father might have to say on this matter. She loved them, but she always felt more like a "show-piece" than their real daughter, a feeling that started when they allowed her to be raised by hirelings like her nanny Harisigo Toyo and her tutors instead of raising her themselves. It didn't help that they were always gone, always traveling the world as they handled business concerns that literally spanned the globe. They loved her yes, but it was indeed a distant and often superficial feeling love.<p>Her "real" mama, Nodoka, had initially had problems with her "daughter's" preferences in lovers, but she had never directly interfered. Undoubtedly Nodoka felt that was her adopted mother's place and affected the honor of the Kaiou Clan and not the Saotome Clan.<p>The older woman had even stopped . . . well mostly stopped trying to set her up with "nice young men" to show her "what being a woman was really about" once she knew just how much she loved Haruka. Nodoka had to stop hinting that her son Ranma might soon be available (if things in Nerima didn't work out) once Nodoka found out she was Ranma. Yes, her revelation on that issue a few months back had definitely put a stop to those conversations.<p>Ranma knew she would always cherish the expression on her momma's face when she thought about grandchildren. Ranma shuddered as she recalled the much less pleased glower she had received when she told her momma about Hotaru. Not that Nodoka had been upset that she'd adopted the child, no what she had been upset about was the fact that Ranma hadn't brought her over long before. Nodoka wanted grandchildren for her to spoil, even now her mama suffered from the long years that Genma had caused her to lose with her own child. Nodoka didn't want to lose even a minute of the time she had with her grandkids. That omission would have to be rectified very soon, she just hoped that Haruka and Hotaru would survive the experience. Her mama could be nearly as overwhelming as a tsunami when she got going, something that those seeing only her "public face" had a hard time believing.<p>Finally reaching the car Ranma pulled her lover down into a scorching kiss before getting into the high-performance sports car.<p>"That's just a warm-up," she grinned, leaving Haruka standing stunned outside the vehicle with a goofy grin on her face.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Now in civilian dress seven young girls and a much older woman (though Setsuna's looks certainly belied her true age) watched as Uranus and Neptune, (now Haruka and Michiru) walked away from the rest of the senshi.<p>"Well that was certainly interesting," Makoto was the first to speak. "Just what the heck is going on?"<p>"I don't know," was the general chorus that answered her question.<p>"How in the world did Neptune get so good with a sword?" Rei mused, with the same negative reply as the only response.<p>"Girls. I got some rather interesting readings today," Ami interrupted ignoring as usual the antics of her friends.<p>"What about Neptune? Did you get anything on her?" Makoto pressed anxiously. While the Outers were sometimes hard to deal with things had gotten better, much better over the last year or so. They still weren't as close to her as the Inners, but they had become friends, and Makoto was concerned. Just what had Haruka meant when she called Neptune Azami, and why wasn't Pluto been concerned.<p>Admittedly it was hard to read Setsuna, but the green-haired woman hadn't even raised an eyebrow at the skills shown by Neptune today. It was possible that Pluto hadn't seen the confrontation, but she HAD been there when Neptune returned the Space Sword.<p>"I don't know anything with certainty Makoto," Ami replied. "I can tell you that her energy signature was pure Silver Millennium and matched the readings that I already have on Michiru as Neptune. In addition Haruka didn't appear to be upset, only surprised."<p>"Yeah, I noticed that too," Rei agreed. "Though I'd say she was shocked out of her mind instead of just surprised. Especially given how close those two are . . . " The senshi of Mars repressed a shiver as she continued.<p>Yes Haruka and Michiru were friends, sometimes-distant friends, but friends and comrades nonetheless. There were occasions though when they made her feel something that she didn't want to consider possible or even really think of. The way they carried on, and the sultry looks they gave each other could almost light a fire, and she occasionally feared she might be flammable.<p>It wasn't so much that they were together, it was just how open they often were with their love . . . or even the looks that Haruka sometimes gave the others during the meetings. The tall blond would from time to time appraise them as if they were "of interest" to her, and if to her did that mean Michiru as well? Rei didn't know why, but for some reason the idea that Michiru might be interested in her frightened and yet intrigued her more than Haruka's open flaunting of her "bent".<p>Rei knew that Uranus was teasing not really expecting anything from the others. Haruka knew as well as anyone just how "boy-hungry" all of the inners were . . . well all but Ami. Not that Ami shared their leaning, it was just that Ami was really shy and not nearly so open with her desire to find a boy. Yes Haruka definitely knew how boy hungry Venus and Jupiter were, Rei still remembered how Haruka had flirted with both of them before they discovered she was a girl. She had made quite a handsome boy after all. That didn't change the fact though that the senshi of Mars sometimes wondered just what would happen if she (or one of the others) ever did flirt back. The idea both intrigued and repelled her at the same time. Given just how possessive Michiru was though she never expected to find out . . . not that she really wanted to, Rei quickly assured herself., so the thought had stayed right there, a thought that she avoided thinking about whenever possible.<p>It didn't escape Rei's notice though that the quiet senshi of Neptune often looked both attracted and yet somehow embarrassed when she was around the other senshi during the transformations. Rei had noticed the blue-eyed Neptune turning guiltily away from the others, and given her predilections Rei wondered about that.<p>". . . as close as they are."<p>"You mean they're lovers don't you," Minako butted in.<p>"Uhmm, yeah," Rei responded uncomfortably.<p>Minako smiled secretively; sometimes it was just too easy to tease Mars.<p>"You'd think that if something happened to Michiru that Haruka would've told us," the senshi of love continued.<p>"Well, yeah I do," Rei responded. "Unless Pluto told her not to."<p>"There is that," the others agreed.<p>"Now what makes you think she's not Michiru?" a cool voice interjected from just behind the Sailor of Venus."<p>"Eeekkkk," Minako screeched. "Don't do that! You know . . ."<p>"It isn't so funny when she does it to you is it?" Usagi laughed as she watched Minako try to climb a nearby street light.<p>Minako harrumphed as her face fell into a cute pout.<p>"I wouldn't worry about it," Pluto continued. "That WAS Michiru, and she was more herself than she's been in years." Setsuna continued calmly, her eyes on Hotaru as she tried to convey without words the message that all would be fine.<p>The violet eyed stare that Setsuna received in return told her that young Saturn was not pleased and was likely going to try to pry the information from her as soon as possible and she might use the Silence Glaive as the crowbar.<p>"What do you mean?" came the chorus from the inner senshi, Ami excluded as the senshi of Mercury contented herself with an inquiring look and an arched eyebrow.<p>"That . . .," Pluto began then paused for effect, "is a secret."<p>"I hate you," Rei stated flatly, after she pulled herself up from a face- fault, only to be echoed by the others, again excluding Mercury who simply took this as another of Setsuna's quirks.<p>"Don't worry things will become clearer shortly," Pluto advised. "You should be more concerned about the new enemy. This enemy is like no one you've faced before and very likely the toughest enemy you've had, but enough of that, we all need to get home. It is going to be a long day tomorrow, and this can wait until then.<p>"Why is it that every new enemy is "like no one we've ever faced before" and is going to be "our toughest fight ever? Why can't we ever find an enemy that's stupid and weak?" Tsukino Usagi muttered dejectedly as she and the other senshi split up and headed home.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Setsuna-mama, we need to talk," Hotaru squared off against the enigmatic woman she called mama.<p>"Oh, and what makes you think I have anything to say right now?" Pluto answered coolly.<p>"Because you know something, and I want to know what that is." Hotaru answered, determination flashing somewhere deep in her violet eyes. "I'm worried about Michiru-mama and you know at least some of what is going on."<p>"Why do you say that?"<p>"Don't patronize me mama!" Hotaru fired back. "You said mama is more Michiru than she's been in a long time. That means you know something."<p>Chibi-Usa watched the exchange with eyes grew ever wider with each exchange. She knew that her friend must be really upset to press Pluto so hard. Usually the girl was quiet and nearly passive in her relations with other, especially others she loved or respected, but tonight she was taking Setsuna on with no hesitation, and no surrender evident in her expressive eyes.<p>Setsuna met Hotaru's angry gaze with an icy calm one of her own, and called upon her long years of life to do so unflinchingly. It also helped to know that Hotaru was a gentle soul who wouldn't abuse the earth shattering power that was hers to control.<p>"What is going on?" Hotaru pressed.<p>"You know that I can't tell you everything,"<p>"I know that Setsuna-mama. I've had that conversation with . . . "Hotaru paused and turned her gimlet glare from Pluto to Chibi-Usa. "Freeze Usa, you're not getting out of this either."<p>"Eeeppp," Chibi-Usa froze as ordered, caught as she tried to sneak upstairs, guilt clear on her face as she blushed with embarrassment.<p>"I want both of you to sit down and tell me what you know."<p>Setsuna rubbed her temples striving to fight off the headache that she knew was coming. "Hotaru you know that it can be dangerous to give out information that will affect the time-line," Setsuna answered wearily. "It's not worth the risk . . ."<p>"Setsuna-mama, I'm worried about Michiru-mama. It's been really weird today. We went to Nerima and she knew her way around like she'd grown up there. Then on top of that she was hugging and kissing a really pretty girl, and saying she'd missed her so much."<p>Hotaru knew she was probably over-emphasizing what had happened with Kasumi. Yeah, the hugging part was true and so was the conversation, but the kisses were just on the cheek. Still the young senshi decided, if overplaying what happened a bit would get Setsuna to talk then by kami she was going to "overplay" if it helped get answers.<p>"Then we saw her using the Space Sword like she was some kind of master samurai . . . and all you say is, "She's more Michiru than she's been in a long time," Hotaru finished with a rather good, if sarcastic, imitation of Pluto's usual tone.<p>"Yes that does pretty well describe what happened today doesn't it," the crimson-eyed woman responded calmly.<p>Ignoring Pluto's calm answer Hotaru rounded on Chibi-Usa.<p>"You know something to don't you?" Hotaru ran over Usa's attempted reply as she continued. "And don't give me any guff about "All the scouts are my sensei either," she finished with a rather imperious tone.<p>"But . . . "<p>"Don't 'but' me Usa, you know something and it's time to tell me." Hotaru felt tears welling up in her violet eyes as the anger began to ebb.<p>"I'm scared, Michiru IS my mama and something's going on. I just want to know if she's going to be okay," what started out as an angry impassioned speech, ended with a wail of near utter anguish.<p>Chibi-Usa felt her resolve to hold firm wavering as she considered the pain her best friend, and eventual co-wife, was going through.<p>"Hotaru, I . . . "<p>"That's enough!" Setsuna interrupted before the neo-princess could say anything further. "Matters are going to come to a head in the next couple of days. How they turn out is going to have a major impact on Crystal Tokyo."<p>Turning away from Chibi-Usa the enigmatic Senshi of Pluto turned her attention to Hotaru. "My future self has told me that the what happens next is going to be very important . . . and that we all have to be very careful. She also told me that we are going to need to show Michiru that we love her and support her."<p>"But mama knows we love her doesn't she?" Hotaru interrupted. "She's always so strong and takes care of me and Haruka-papa."<p>"Yes, Michiru is a strong woman," Pluto agreed, "but according to me, my future self that is, she might break, there is a lot that she's been hiding and if Haruka rejects her then all hell is going to break loose."<p>"You don't really think that could happen do you?" Chibi-Usa queried. "I mean they're still together . . . "<p>"No, I don't think that is likely, but it could happen. I don't know WHY Michiru is so worried. I don't know why she has been hiding her skills, I don't know why I'm worried about your mama and papa, I'm sure they love each other, nor am I sure what is going on in Nerima, but I do know I was worried. I also know that I told myself to meet me at the Time Gates tomorrow afternoon as soon as the meeting at the Shrine is over, so I expect that I'll know more then. I just don't know yet how much I can tell anyone."<p>Setsuna paused as she carefully considered her next words. "I also told myself to go to a Saotome Nodoka's house tomorrow morning, and then to the Masaki shrine tomorrow afternoon to see something. I can take you with me Hotaru, but we've got to be careful. I gave strict instructions to myself that we aren't to be seen, nor are we to interfere with what is going on."<p>"I just hope to Kami that I know what I'm doing, I hate it when I can't even tell myself what to expect," Setsuna muttered to herself, the words to faint to be heard by her audience of two.<p>Crimson eyes locked onto and held violet eyes shimmering with tears as she continued. "Will you promise me that no matter what we see or hear that you will obey my commands and not interfere?"<p>Hotaru paused, even more worried than she was a few moments ago. She was surprised and somewhat elated that she was getting even this much, but the seriousness of her second mama's words and the implacable tone of her voice worried her as well. The senshi of Saturn could read Pluto better than most, and what she was seeing mirrored her own feelings. Pluto was worried . . . and that scared her.<p>"Yes mama, I promise," she whispered. "I won't interfere."<p>"Good, then we'll find out more tomorrow, and don't worry if it wasn't going to turn out okay I'd be telling myself more than this. Now off to bed you go, both of you."<p>Setsuna watched as the girls nodded their agreement and headed upstairs. After they were safely upstairs Pluto let her calm façade drop. What she had said was true, if things were going to go sour she'd have told herself more . . . she just hoped that it was going to be more than Crystal Tokyo survived this latest crisis . . . she desperately hoped that it was her family that was going to be okay. Setsuna knew that in a lot of ways she and Michiru were alike, they both hid their fears behind a mask and showed the world only what the world needed to see. What she didn't know was why things were coming to a head.<p>Yes, there was a new enemy and she knew that Michiru's skills were going to be critical in fighting this enemy. She shuddered at the thought of who they were going to be facing and the forces upon which she could call. They weren't going to be fighting the Negaverse this time . . . no they were going to be fighting the forces of Hell itself.<p>Pluto knew that Michiru was an accomplished martial artist, but she didn't know why Neptune had hidden her abilities for so long. There had been many a time when those skills would've come in very handy, and Michiru had the gift of teaching, she'd seen that on more than one occasion when Neptune had taught others the violin and she had no reason to doubt that Michiru would be able to pass along her fighting skills as well. Still there was much that troubled her. Pluto had watched all of the senshi growing up. She'd seen Michiru take to the martial arts with an intensity that was almost inhuman, she'd seen the young girl begin her training while still in the orphanage and even then at the age of six she'd shown skills more suited to a master, or maybe even a grandmaster. It was a puzzle that had plagued her for years, and frustrated her for even more as Michiru's past before the age of six had been blocked. The time gates refused to show her anything of Michiru's life before then . . . and the most frustrating thing of all was that the hand blocking her was her own.
