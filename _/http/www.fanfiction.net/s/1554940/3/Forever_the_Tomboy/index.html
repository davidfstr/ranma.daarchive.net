</div>See Chapter 1 for Disclaimer<p>Forever the Tomboy – Ch. 3 - A Walk In Nerima<p>Tendo Kasumi was in a bit of a quandary. Her long time friend Kaiou Michiru was back, visiting for the first time in nearly two years. But, her friend Michiru was also Saotome Ranma. Kasumi could feel the wry smile twisting her lips as she considered this fact, only Ranma could be a part of something so surreal.<p>Ranma was as wild as his name indicated, rough in manner, unbroken in spirit, it was nearly impossible to believe that he and the calm, serene Michiru were one and the same.<p>Ranma had been staying at the Tendo Dojo for almost two years, the unwilling fiancée of her youngest sister, until Akane had finally driven him away, causing his recent disappearance. Ranma was . . . well Ranma, and wherever the "wild horse" went chaos followed.<p>The last two years had been quite a ride, no-one was untouched by the craziness that clung to him more closely than even his trademark silks, a fact that was true beyond any doubt. Even knowing (as she did), that her childhood friend Michiru was Ranma had not prepared her for everything that had transpired. Of course, Kasumi thought with an unaccustomed giggle, she wasn't sure that anything could have prepared her for the events that had taken place since Ranma arrived.<p>She could remember as if it were yesterday the arrival of a rain-soaked panda and a petite redheaded girl whose mere presence breathed life into the Tendo Dojo for the first time since her mother's death.<p>Kasumi took a deep breath as she put the finishing touches on the tea service she was preparing. The water was hot and the tea her favorite blend, however her mind was not really on the work of her hands, instead it was focused on the two guests who were patiently waiting for her return.<p>Kasumi knew that even now she wasn't privy as to exactly what had transpired to drive Ranma from the Tendo dojo. She knew even less about how he had managed to create his new life, though she had her suspicions. Right now she figured that the only one who really how she had done it was Ranma/Michiru herself, and so far she wasn't telling.<p>All that Kasumi knew was that it had to involve time-travel and that probably meant the Nanban mirror. Her curiosity was definitely getting the better of her as she thought on the situation. The eldest Tendo sister reaaaallly hoped that Michiru was going to finally divulge at least some of the secrets that she held so close to he r chest.<p>Nodding to herself Kasumi recalled the first time that Michiru had told her that Ranma was coming, how she had reacted with scorn, politely veiled but there none-the-less, and how Michiru had only smiled that cool, calm smile of hers and told her to wait and believe. Michiru then advised Kasumi that she would call her the following week to see if her predictions had come true.<p>To Kasumi's utter shock things had indeed progressed just as her friend had foretold. The arrival of the panda, the initial confrontation between the "wild horse" and her sister Akane. Even the thoughtless comment which precipitated the breaking of the dining room table over Ranma's head had been predicted in excruciating detail by Michiru.<p>Kasumi had breathlessly awaited the first "post-Ranma arrival" phone call and meeting Michiru scheduled with her. For once even her vaunted calm had been sorely tried. She had without hesitation gone to visit Michiru at her home in Juban. There they had a loooonnnng and quite interesting talk. Even the accuracy of Michiru's account of Ranma's arrival didn't blunt the eldest Tendo's amazement as Michiru outlined the course of the next two years and the events that were about to transpire. Michiru had taken Kasumi's own reactions with quiet humor, that infuriating smile never leaving her oh so perfect face, and only the mischief dancing in Michiru's sapphire eyes betrayed her enjoyment of the situation.<p>Indeed things had gone pretty much as her long-time friend had predicted, including Ranma's disappearance just three weeks ago.<p>Smiling, this time with a real smile gracing her features, a smile such as she had not allowed herself to give into in years, Kasumi picked up the tray and returned to the dining room to sit with her guests.<p>Her guests looked so cute together as they knelt by the table Kasumi noted once again as she entered the familiar confines of the dining area. Michiru was in an adorable yet practical silk shirt, the blue shade drawing out and emphasizing the aqua hair and sapphire eyes. Kasumi also noted Ranma's well-manicured hands, her smile blossomed even more when she took in the polished nails also tinted to compliment her friends hair and eyes. Michiru's expertly applied make-up enhanced the girl's astounding beauty without drawing notice to the cosmetics themselves. It appeared that Ranma had a firm hand in training her daughter in the art of the "makeover" as Hotaru-chan's make-up style was similar, enhancing and accentuating without drawing undue attention to the make-up itself.<p>Kasumi's smile widened as she placed the tea set down. Whatever was on her friends mind must be serious to have changed her plans. Kasumi knew from her last conversation with Ranma that she intended to meet Happosai tomorrow, and while Kasumi had her suspicions as to what was going to transpire Michiru had not confirmed them as of yet. What she suspected was that Michiru was going to challenge Happosai for the right to use and to claim masters status in the Art of the Anything Goes style. However, that was business for tomorrow, right now her duty was to her guests and as the hostess she had obligations to fulfill.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Hotaru squirmed as she knelt by the low table. Things were, well strange, if that word was strong enough to describe the events so far, and from all appearances the strangeness was not yet over. The young senshi saw things spiraling out of control as events were occurring faster than she could process them.<p>Michiru was kneeling next to her seemingly as serene and elegant as always, but Hotaru knew her mama well and could sense Michiru's nervousness, even if she couldn't see it reflected in that ever so tranquil face of hers. It was times like these that made her realize why no one wanted to play poker with either her mother or Ami. No one could read Michiru, and Ami was just to good at calculating the odds. No, things were just . . . strange and to a senshi strange often meant trouble. Sometimes Hotaru felt that peace was an elusive creature that she was fated to glimpse but never to catch.<p>Before she was had even completed her musing thoughts, the brunette who had hugged her mama returned. Fighting a smile Hotaru decided that hugged wasn't a strong enough description for what had happened. Kasumi had "glomped" her mama, and it was expertly enough executed that if it had been seen both Minako and Mokoto would've demanded lessons as to the proper method of its employment.<p>That worried Hotaru more than she wanted to admit. She had lost her father to the Negaverse and her mother long before that. Haruka-papa, Michiru- mama and Setsuna-mama were her family, her lifelines. The thought, as unlikely as it was, that Michiru had another girlfriend upset Hotaru greatly. She hoped that they were just friends, but it was strange that mama had never mentioned Tendo Kasumi before, nor Nerima other than in passing, yet she seemed to know them both well, very well indeed to judge from the quick walk from the train station directly to the dojo.<p>The violet eyed senshi watched as Kasumi carefully placed the tea service on the table then gracefully took her position as hostess. Hotaru looked on with more than a touch of envy as Kasumi began the ceremony, executing the formalities with a grace that Hotaru could only hope to someday attain.<p>Once the formalities of the tea ceremony were finished the Senshi of Silence waited more than a little impatiently for her elders to begin. Torn between a desire to break the silence and fear of what was to come, she instead held onto that silence. Well fear of what was to come AND a fear of what Michiru-mama would have to say to her if she interrupted kept her quiet.<p>Instead she watched as Michiru sipped the tea for a moment then sighed contentedly.<p>"It's been to long since we did this Kasumi." Michiru began. "I've missed our quiet times together so much."<p>Kasumi nodded, then placed her own teacup carefully on the table. "Yes it has, it has been much to long," she paused before continuing, "I've missed you." Voice breaking the older woman looked away as she took a moment to compose herself.<p>"It won't be much longer and we can see each other again, in Juban at least if not here." Michiru consoled Kasumi, reaching out to take the other woman's hand. Hotaru heard the steel in Michiru's voice as she continued, "Though I think I have that covered as well."<p>Once again Hotaru felt like she was missing the most important parts of the conversation. However she knew one thing with certainty, she did NOT like the sound of this conversation or the way it appeared to be going. Haruka- papa was the one who had roving eyes with her rakish manner and made occasional sly comments about other women. Hotaru was sure though that Haruka-papa would never leave Michiru though as she loved her to much. However, she had never seen Michiru act this way before.<p>For a moment Hotaru wondered just what it was that Pluto knew, was this the secret that Setsuna had been talking about this morning. Did her mama have another lover, it didn't seem right, she knew how much Michiru loved Haruka- papa, she even had a date with her for later tonight, but if this wasn't the secret, just what was Setsuna talking about?<p>Hotaru desperately hoped that she was reading the conversation wrong. She could tell she was missing a major part of it. The older women seemed to be speaking on two (or maybe more) levels. One was the words actually spoken, the other was hidden within or perhaps behind what the words used, as much inferred as stated, but which also indicated a long relationship between her mama and Kasumi.<p>"But that is not why I am here today. There is something else you can help me with."<p>Michiru indicated the girl sitting beside her and looked over at her daughter with a small smile.<p>"Indeed." Kasumi replied, "You mentioned that you wanted to discuss something."<p>"Yes." Michiru took another appreciative sip. "Hotaru has been having a hard time at school." Her voice hardened as she continued. "She has a gift and her classmates treat her shamefully because of it."<p>Kasumi's interest was indicated wordlessly by the arching of a delicate eyebrow raised in query.<p>Hotaru's face reddened in embarrassment, was her mama going to just tell this stranger about her power? It seemed unbelievable, but by all appearances that was exactly what her mama intended.<p>"Mama," she began, traces of her inner struggle clearly evident in the girl's voice.<p>"Don't worry dear, Kasumi won't tease you."<p>"But mama..."<p>"I said don't worry." Though soft and comforting in both tone and content, a daughter could her the steel of a mothers voice underlying them.<p>"Now . . . Michiru. If she doesn't want to talk . . . " Kasumi began, only to be interrupted by her aqua tressed friend.<p>"Kasumi, we need to talk about this . . . I want you to give Hotaru your take on this, and perhaps she should hear from a few others as well." Michiru interjected softly, but with great insistence.<p>"Well, if you think it's important." Kasumi conceded reluctantly.<p>"I do. Now would bring me one of your paring knives please?"<p>Kasumi hesitated again, then consented with a nod. Rising to her feet she disappeared into the kitchen then returned with a small but ever so sharp knife which she handed to Michiru.<p>"Watch carefully." Michiru requested as she took the blade. "and don't worry."<p>Hotaru felt her stomach clench. She knew what was coming and despite the almost palpable aura of calm that surrounded Ms. Tendo she felt nervous. Dread filled her soul as she watched her mama carefully cut her own arm leaving a long gash to mar the soft white skin. Despite her suspicions as to her mother's actions, actually watching the action caused the violet eyed senshi to gasp softy as she watched her mama cut herself, slicing into her own flesh with the knife.<p>"Michiru . . . " Kasumi interjected, "What . . . . "<p>"Just watch." Michiru commanded. as she squeezed the cut making sure that it bled freely.<p>Turning to her daughter Michiru extended her arm.<p>Hotaru refused to meet either of the other women's eyes as she reached out to take her mama's arm. Concentrating she reached for her gift, the one that had caused her so much grief in the past, and called it forth as she touched her mother's arm. Even though she knew she could easily heal the shallow cut it still hurt her to see her mother hurt.<p>Closing her eyes Hotaru touched the long shallow wound. For a moment her small hands glowed, as did the skin surrounding Michiru's wound. Then the cut sealed itself leaving no mark of its passage other than the blood still trickling down her mama's arm.<p>Hotaru heard the involuntary gasp, though it was ever so quiet, from Kasumi. With her eyes firmly fixed on the table Hotaru missed the questioning look Kasumi shot her mother and the confirming nod that Michiru returned.<p>Hotaru waited for the words she knew were coming next, waited for the shocked accusations of impure blood, that she was some kind of freak or monster. Stiffening in place, but still refusing to look up Hotaru waited for the condemnation that she knew was coming.<p>The words she heard were indeed a shock, and were not the ones she expected to hear.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Kasumi felt her jaw drop as she watched the tableau before her. She had been expecting some story about how the kids picked on Hotaru because of her mother and "father" not a casual display of power.<p>"Oh my," She gasped involuntarily. Looking from the wound to the deep sapphire eyes of her friend she saw the concerned looks on Michiru/Ranma's face.<p>"Hotaru-chan . . . did you do that." Kasumi breathed softly wonder evident in her voice.<p>She was surprised when the girl refused to look up. But then as she considered what she had been told by Michiru she was not. Children were often so very cruel to each other. They picked out even the smallest of differences then used those differences to tease and torment each other. Sometimes the teasing was gentle and in fun . . . at other times though the teasing was unmerciful and viscous. The pitiful look on the child's face clearly told the gentle Kasumi which type of teasing the pretty girl in front of her had been subjected to.<p>The eldest Tendo felt her heart going out to the still quiet, and obviously hurting, child sitting so expectantly before her. She could see the worry and fear the girl was trying to hide by the squared set of her shoulders and the sad expression adorning her pixyish face. It was clear that this child expected the worst sort of reaction, and yet the gift was one of healing... a wonderful gift to have.<p>"Such a gift Hotaru-chan. Such a precious gift . . . oh I wish that I had such a gift." Kasumi's voice nearly sang with longing as she spoke.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Hotaru looked up at the softly spoken words. She expected to see fear, or perhaps only pity if she were lucky. Instead she saw wonder mixed with more than a little envy in the older woman's face.<p>Where was the fear? Hotaru wasn't sure what was going on.<p>Knowing that the darker emotions had to be there she looked closer, trying to see past the eyes and into the soul of the other woman. She looked for the disgust and fear she had seen so often in others and which she just knew had to be hidden under Kasumi's mask. But apparently Kasumi was reading from a different script, as she couldn't find any trace of these base emotions. What she saw was genuine compassion, a tender warmth that made her feel loved. It was the first time she had ever seen such an expression after she had healed someone as herself and not as the senshi Sailor Saturn..<p>"You . . . you don't think that was weird?" Hotaru disliked the desperation she heard in her own voice, the plea for acceptance. She didn't like to hear such weakness in her own voice, but it was there.<p>"No dear, you have a gift, a rare gift tis true, but one to be embraced and not rejected. I most certainly do not consider you to be weird, or freakish or any of the other names you may have been called by others. I want you to know that those who are to unsure of their own worth are the first to reject the talents and gifts of others."<p>Kasumi smiled at her as she spoke and Hotaru felt something deep inside release. It was as if a muscle that had long been knotted up in pain was beginning to relax, a constant ache that she had had for so long began to ease.<p>"I think that is a gift from the Kami." Kasumi continued, he voice nearly singing with excitement.<p>Hotaru watched as Kasumi toyed with her necklace, the small golden cross being caressed lovingly if unconsciously. "Kami-sama bestows His gifts where He will."<p>"It should be a blessing and the gift of healing is most definitely NOT a curse." Kasumi continued. "Besides I've seen people heal using ki before . . . now if you want weird I can tell you some stories you won't believe even though they are as true as the fact that you are sitting at my table."<p>This time, her eyes fixed on Kasumi's tender face, Hotaru saw the glace Kasumi shot her mother, and noticed the faint grin that accompanied said look. Michiru simply raised her teacup in a silent salute as if Kasumi had scored a point in their unseen game. This only raised the curiosity level even higher in the young Scout.<p>"Stories of something weirder than this?" Hotaru questioned, "That doesn't seem likely. I've never seen anyone else able to heal with a touch."<p>"Much stranger." Kasumi affirmed, "Now if you two will wait a moment I have something to show you."<p>Kasumi rose easily to her feet. "Everything she does is graceful." Hotaru thought wistfully to herself watching the brunette get up.<p>"Mama," Hotaru paused uncertain as how to continue. "What is going on?"<p>She watched as her aqua haired mother carefully placed the tea-cup on the table before answering."<p>"Hotaru-chan, What makes you thing something is going on?"<p>"Michiru-mama! Don't tease me. You've been acting strange all morning, and Setsuna-mama was talking about secrets this morning too and acting wise and all-knowing again."<p>"Hotaru." Michiru answered softly, "Some things are best left unsaid."<p>Before Hotaru could pursue the matter further Kasumi returned with a pair of books, which upon closer examination revealed themselves to be photo albums. Hotaru looked up with some confusion, and even more curiosity shining in her eyes.<p>She watched as Kasumi abandoned her prior place at the table and settled down next to her.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Kasumi smiled at the look on Hotaru's face. The girl was practically shaking with excitement as she looked at the books then up into her face. Kasumi's smile was warm and tender as she considered the (nearly) unbelievable stories she was about to share.<p>Kasumi hesitated momentarily; she was going to have to consider her words carefully as it was obvious that Hotaru knew nothing of Saotome Ranma or the events in Nerima.<p>Opening the first book Kasumi began. Pointing to a picture of the youngest Tendo, her smile became a bit dreamy as she recalled the circumstances surrounding the picture of Akane, her mallet and a flattened Ranma.<p>"This is my youngest sister Akane." She began. "Tell me what you see."<p>Hotaru looked at the picture closely, puzzlement evident on her pixy face.<p>"It's a glowing girl holding a . . . glowing hammer?" she questioned more than stated. "But why is the hammer glowing . . . and why is she glowing?"<p>Kasumi's smile faltered then fell completely as she recalled the abuse that Ranma had suffered from the very first day he'd arrived.<p>"Akane can . . . " Kasumi paused looking for the right words, ". . . summon I guess is the best was to describe it, a mallet from somewhere when she's really angry. That glow you see is her battle aura."<p>"Battle aura?" Hotaru's questioning gaze soured as she looked up at the woman next to her. "Is this some kind of joke? Were talking about real life not Dragon Ball Z or some other anime or manga story." Her voice flattened as she began to suspect this seemingly nice woman was making fun of her just like everyone always did.<p>"This is no joke. My sister is a martial artist," Kasumi shot Michiru quick glare when the aqua haired woman emitted a soft snort of disapproval at the description. "Akane is quite good in fact though there are others here in Nerima that make her look like an amateur, something that Akane really hates."<p>"She knows some martial arts." Michiru interjected coldly, "But until she learns discipline and how to control that anger she is NOT a martial artist."<p>Hotaru was stunned by the venom in her mother's cold tone. She hadn't heard Michiru use that tone in a long time. Not only that, but once again her mama was showing knowledge of people and events in Nerima that she had never revealed before. Just what else was her mama hiding behind her calm demeanor, what other skeletons were lurking in the closet of her past. Hotaru didn't know, and she was almost afraid to find out. It was as if there were two Kaiou Michiru's.<p>Still the youngest senshi persisted" This IS fake isn't it." Hotaru nearly insisted, "Normal people can't do things like that."<p>"No it's all real, hard to believe maybe, but very real." Kasumi answered gently, she could see the doubt in Hotaru's face and hear the plaintive accusation in the tone as well as the words spoken. "Just as real as your gift of healing."<p>"My sister is quite gifted," this time Kasumi turned to Michiru as her friend again displayed disagreement. "Michiru she is gifted, maybe not as much as you, but more than most martial artists double her age."<p>Hotaru watched the exchange closely, and saw the grudging agreement in her mother's eyes. But still she wondered at the brunette's words. Her mama, a very gifted martial artist? Hotaru knew that her mother held a first dan ranking in kempo, but everyone knew that both Makoto and Haruka were much more skilled than Michiru, and mama had never done anything to prove differently. Once again questions bubbled to the surface of her mind as she considered the problem before her. Her mama wasn't denying the statement; indeed she appeared to agree with it. But if Michiru did have the talent and skill that the eldest Tendo was giving to her, why didn't she use it as Sailor Neptune. There were times when that skill would have been very useful. Just what the hell was going on?<p>Hotaru flinched reflexively at her use of curse words even though it wasn't spoken aloud. She had on one or two occasions felt her mother's wrath for such language, though Michiru tolerated Haruka's language when papa was racing, or hanging out with her pit crew, otherwise mama didn't allow such language.<p>"All right." Michiru conceded, "She does have some talent, but until she controls her temper she isn't going to get much better, though anger does seem to be the focus for her ki use to summon mallet-sama."<p>"Can she really do that?" Hotaru asked. She hated to interrupt the conversation as she learning things (if the conversation was in fact true) about her mother that she never expected, but her questions still needed answers.<p>"Yes she can." Her mother finally answered. "It appears in her hand and appears to be a solid construct made of ki."<p>"So you've seen it?" Hotaru questioned.<p>Michiru appeared to be taken aback at the question as a brief look of concern flashed across her face. Only one who knew her as well as her daughter would have seen the emotion, but Hotaru knew guilt when she saw it.<p>The Senshi of Saturn waited impatiently for her mother's response and watched as her mother's face stilled, the bright sapphire eyes clouding as they hid the thoughts of one Kaiou Michiru. Hotaru had seen this before, it was the same thing that happened every time her mother became Sailor Neptune, gone (or maybe just hidden more deeply) was her loving mama, left behind was a warrior.<p>"Yes," Michiru sighed. "I've been around when Akane has gone into her 'beat the pervert' mode."<p>Hotaru peered into her mother's eyes. She was somewhat reassured as she sensed her mama was telling the truth, but once again she wondered if she was telling ALL of the truth, and had Akane considered her mama one of the perverts to punish?<p>"You see that boy, the one who's just been pounded?" Michiru questioned. Seeing her daughter nod she continued. "That's Saotome Ranma. He is one of the best martial artists around, maybe one of the best in the world, Akane is one of his fiancées."<p>Hotaru blinked, considered what she had heard, then asked hesitantly, "One of his fiancées."<p>This time it was Kasumi who answered. "Yes one of his fiancées. He has or had at least five official fiancées that we know of, another who considers herself a fiancée, and one wife."<p>Hotaru observed the look that Kasumi gave Michiru when she said wife, but could make nothing of it, and Michiru's face gave nothing away.<p>"What kind of creep is he?" Hotaru fumed, "No wonder she pounded him." Hotaru indicated Akane.<p>"It wasn't his fault." Kasumi interrupted Hotaru before she could continue her tirade. All but one was the result of his father's own greed and stupidity." Kasumi's voice was soft, nearly sorrowful as she spoke.<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"Saotome Genma, Ranma's father, took Ranma on a training trip when Ranma was six years old. For ten years they wandered and trained with Ranma's only real companion being his father. Genma made Ranma into an incredible martial artist, but if it didn't pertain directly to martial arts he didn't teach it to Ranma. As a result Ranma had a severe foot in mouth problem, though he also had a heart of gold.<p>Even more unfortunately for Ranma his father is somewhat less than honorable. He engaged Ranma to several different girls in return for food, lodging, cash or other items. This started when Ranma was only six. The only one that was even partially Ranma's fault was Shampoo."<p>"Shampoo? What kind of name is that?" Hotaru wondered.<p>"Shampoo is a Chinese Amazon. Ranma defeated her in combat and according to their laws she is his wife and he has to marry her." Kasumi responded. "And they've tried everything they can think of to force him to marry her, potions, spells, curses, shiatsu points and even drugs."<p>Hotaru shot her mother a sideways glance, only to see her mama looking at her with amusement and a confirming nod.<p>"I thought maybe you could take her to see Elder Cologne, Shampoo and Mousse later today." Michiru added. They can show her some things that make a healing gift look positively mundane by comparison." Then with a mischievous grin, Michiru continued. "They don't normally like to show off Amazon Tribal Secrets, but if Too Too Nice Girl asks I don't think even Cologne can say no."<p>"Too Too Nice Girl?" Hotaru's face twisted with obvious puzzlement, giving her an unbearably cute look.<p>Michiru laughed while Kasumi simply gave a blindingly bright smile before answering the question.<p>"Shampoo still doesn't speak Japanese well, and she has a habit of giving descriptive nick-names to everyone she meets. That is what she calls me."<p>Once again Hotaru was surprised by the knowledge that her mother was showing regarding the situation in Nerima.<p>"But back to what we were telling you. There are several people here in Nerima with special abilities or gifts."<p>Kasumi pointed to a picture of Ranma holding a ki ball. "Ranma can focus his ki into energy blasts, he heals almost as quickly as a werewolf in a Hollywood movie. I've seem him recover from a broken arm in less than two weeks."<p>"Two weeks?" Hotaru stuttered.<p>"Yes," Kasumi answered, "and that is not all Ranma has done."<p>Kasumi flipped to the next page, continuing her tale as she recounted the adventures that had occurred over the last two years.<p>Kasumi calmly continued to regale her audience of two with story after story, detailing the skills, powers and abilities of the NWC. She talked of the Amazons, Shampoo, Cologne and Mousse and shared some of their more esoteric skills. Kasumi told Hotaru of Ryoga's curse, his skills and the Shi Shi Hodoken that he used, of Saotome Genma and the "sealed techniques" that he had only reluctantly taught Ranma.<p>Hotaru listened, soaking up the details as the brunette spoke, amazed at the lives that these "normal" humans had. Time passed quickly for the trio as they sat and talked, Kasumi telling the stories with the only breaks in her tale being to answer the occasional question put forth by the youngest of the three.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Hotaru felt overwhelmed as she listened to Kasumi's words. Even now the youngest of the senshi would have doubted the older woman's words, except for the calm acceptance evident on her mother's face.<p>Finally, when Kasumi wound down to a close the violet eyes girl gathered her wits about her to ask a few more questions.<p>Hotaru pointed to a figure about whom Kasumi had told no tales, a cute redheaded girl who appeared often in the album, but who Kasumi never mentioned. This Hotaru found strange given Kasumi's willingness to talk about the others.<p>"Who is this girl?" she asked softly.<p>She noted once again the look that passed between her elders.<p>"Well," Kasumi began hesitantly and somewhat sadly, "That is Ranko."<p>Michiru interrupted before Kasumi answered the question. "That's not important right now. What is important is that Kasumi take you to meet some of these folks." Michiru stated calmly. "I know that you're probably anxious to see if what Kasumi has told you is true or a fairy tale."<p>"Well," Hotaru hedged. "I would like to know more about them."<p>"Good." Her mama answered. "It's about 2:00 now, the lunch rush should be over." Michiru turned to Kasumi before continuing. "Why don't you take Hotaru to the Cat Café." Michiru's words though in the form of a question were more a statement than a request.<p>"Why don't you wait outside while Kasumi and I talk for a minute? Then she can take you to lunch. She needs a break from the housework anyway."<p>Kasumi dissented only for a moment as Michiru told the eldest Tendo that SHE would take care of the dinner preparations then meet then at the rail station around 4:00.<p>Sighing in defeat, Kasumi nodded after putting up only a token argument, it would be nice to get out of the house for a change. With that Hotaru rose and walked outside. She really wanted to stay and hear the rest of the conversation, but knew her mama had a reason for the request, if she could only figure out what that reason was then perhaps all would be made clear.<p>Hotaru waited just outside the door to the home and (despite feeling some guilt) tried to listen to the older women as they talked. To her annoyance however, the girl could hear none of the conversation itself, just the low musical voice as they quietly talked. The only thing she was able to discern was that Kasumi was speaking a little more vehemently than her mama, as if she was trying to convince Michiru of something.<p>By the time the eldest Tendo emerged from the home after (apparently losing that discussion) her face was once again schooled into its serene façade, giving away nothing.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>Ranma smiled to herself as she and Hotaru walked back home from the rail station. Hotaru was bouncing as she walked beside her radiating excitement and practically glowing herself though from happiness and not with a battle aura. She had hoped that taking Hotaru to Nerima would help her daughter see that she was not the only person around "blessed" with a strange life. The plan appeared to have worked.<p>"Mama?" Hotaru questioned softly, "Did you know that Elder Cologne could heal people with her ki?"<p>"No dear I didn't, but that doesn't surprise me to hear that she can." Ranma answered softly. "How does it feel to know that there are others who can do the same things you can?"<p>Hotaru didn't even have to stop and think before shooting her answer back. "It feels pretty good." She admitted. "It's still strange though . . . ."<p>"What is strange?" Ranma questioned when it became apparent that Hotaru wasn't going to finish her statement.<p>"How come we've never heard about all the stuff going on in Nerima? I mean Elder Cologne said that Ranma and some of the others have fought demons and stuff themselves. I mean she was probably actually talking about youma or diamons . . . or maybe some of the other monsters the senshi fight, but it is still strange that we've never heard about it before." Hotaru paused thoughtfully. "We've never had to respond to any calls from there either . . . " again Hotaru's voice trailed off as she considered the new facts in her possession.<p>"Well . . ." Ranma answered, "my guess is that the NWC took care of matters themselves before we needed to do anything."<p>"Maybe." Hotaru allowed, "But it still seems strange."<p>With a small grin adorning her lips Ranma looked down at her daughter. "It may be strange," Her grin expanded exponentially as she continued, "But I think your view of what is "normal" expanded quite a bit today."<p>"Yes, yes it did." Hotaru admitted. "Did you know that when Kasumi took me by the school there was some guy dressed like a samurai attacking her sister Akane and she hit him so hard that he cracked the wall when he hit it and no-one even paid any attention to it. Then a couple of minutes later he got up and wandered off by himself."<p>"I'm not surprised." Ranma answered with another smug grin. "From what Kasumi has told me that kind of thing happens all the time."<p>"Kasumi also told me that Akane is the most popular girl in the school. No- one even cares about any of her special abilities." Hotaru finished wonderingly.<p>"I'm glad you had fun and made some new friends." Ranma advised sincerely. She hated to bring Hotaru down even a little, as it was a rare occurrence for the girl to be this exuberant. "The kids a Juban won't change overnight. But . . . hopefully . . . they will eventually grow up . . . and if they don't you will still meet plenty of others as you get older who will not only accept you, but will love you as much as your papa and I do."<p>"Do you really think so?" Hotaru asked, a little subdued as she considered her friends, or rather the lack thereof at her own school."<p>"Yes I do. Besides didn't Elder Cologne ask you to visit again?"<p>"Yes she did." Hotaru enthused. "I can't wait to visit her and Shampoo again. When can you take me? I really had fun today. I wish today wouldn't end." Hotaru finished somewhat wistfully, her face falling a bit as she wondered how long it would be before she could see her new friends again.<p>She was so caught up in her own excitement Hotaru missed the slight flinch and hesitation before her mama answered. "I have a few things to do first, but I'm sure Kasumi would be happy to see you visit again. She's been stuck in that house for so long and she really needs a friend. I think she'll make as good a friend to you as she has been for me. She told me she really enjoyed your company today, and can't wait to see you again."<p>Hotaru's positively beamed as she considered her first real friend outside of the other sailor senshi and their friends. Although older by several years, Kasumi had been fun to be around, though quieter than the rambunctious Shampoo, Hotaru had definitely enjoyed the time they spent wandering Nerima.<p>Ranma paused to open the door to their home, then waved Hotaru inside.<p>"Don't forget Chibi-usa is coming over tonight. Maybe you two should rent some movies and have a real sleepover.<p>* * * * * * * * * * * *<p>"Hi Hotaru!" Chibi-usa giggled as the door opened revealing her best friend. "What did you do today?"<p>"You won't believe it!" Hotaru replied with a matching giggle, Chibi-usa's presence putting the cherry on top of a wonderful day. "Michiru-mama took me to Nerima and I met the most amazing people."<p>"Michiru-sensei did . . . " The pink haired girl clapped her hands over her mouth as she realized what she had said.<p>Chibi-usa reallllly hoped Hotaru hadn't caught the slip; a quick glance over at her friend caused that hope to die stillborn as Hotaru's purple eyes widened momentarily then narrowed to slits as Hotaru stared at her.<p>"What did you say?" Hotaru hissed. "Is this something else you knew that you weren't supposed to tell?"<p>Chibi-Usa put on her best "who me" innocent expression and pretended not to hear the question. Inside the daughter of Usagi wondered just how she was going to get out of this one. Not only had Saturn caught the slip, she was hanging onto it will bulldog like tenacity.<p>Fortunately for the future princess a reprieve was given her when Haruka came in. The blond senshi was dressed in a freshly pressed tuxedo and quite frankly looked quite handsome. She would easily give Tuxedo Kamen a run for his money tonight.<p>"What's up girls?" Haruka asked. While Uranus might not be as observant about family matters as her lover Michiru, even she could tell something was wrong with the two youngsters. Chibi-usa looked as nervous as a cat lost in the dog pound . . . while Hotaru's expression mirrored that of the same cat with a small mouse targeted and ready to pounce.<p>"Nothing Haruka-papa." Hotaru answered evenly.<p>Chibi-usa wasn't fooled, though the words were quiet and unassuming, the look she was still receiving from her friend was promising that this matter was NOT over yet. The pink-haired Chibi-moon was somewhat relieved that Hotaru wasn't going to pursue the matter further in front of Haruka.<p>The respite was short lived however as Hotaru grabbed Chibi-usa and literally dragged her friend up to her room.<p>Usa gulped as Hotaru pushed her into the room, shut the door, locked it and turned to face her with a look of calm determination.<p>"We are going to talk." Hotaru growled. "and you are going to answer some questions."
