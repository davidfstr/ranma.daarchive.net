</div><p>Disclaimer:  Ranma ½  is property of Rumiko Takahashi.  The  characters are being borrowed for the purposes of this fic, which is meant for  entertainment only.</p><p>Warning:  Remember  the angst I warned you about last time?   Well, it's still here.  Lots of  it. ^ ^</p>Memories are just  where you laid them<p>Drag the waters 'til the depths give up their dead</p><p>What did you expect to find?</p><p>Was it something you left behind?</p><p>Don't you remember</p><p>Everything I said when I said</p><p>Don't fall away</p><p>And leave me to myself</p><p>Don't fall away</p><p>And leave love bleeding in my hands</p><p>In my hands again</p><p>And leave love bleeding in my hands</p><p>In my hands</p><p>Love lies bleeding…</p><p>~Fuel, "Hemorrhage"</p><p>Ryoga ran through the streets, half-blinded by tears, not  knowing where he was headed and not caring.   It hurt far too much to care about something as trivial as a  destination, so long as it was far from <i>there</i>.  He paid no attention to what was around him; the physical world  seemed to have shattered along with his heart, disappearing into the haze of  pain and despair that now comprised his existence.</p><p>So he ran on and on, as though he might be able to escape  from the traitorous agony that stabbed at his soul like so many pieces of  broken glass, dashing through the streets in the fading day towards nothing.</p><p>And if he happened to get hit by a truck on the way, then so  much the better.</p><p>Ryoga kept going until he reached the river, the sunlight  sparkling on its surface cutting through his veil of tears.  Recognizing the place, he ran towards the  bridge that spanned the water and down the embankment below.  Underneath, the single support bent inwards  for several feet to form a hollow metal L.   Anyone passing, even someone on the other side of the river, would see  nothing, if they even bothered to look in the first place.  Ryoga fairly threw himself into the corner,  where he curled into a ball and let the tears come in earnest.</p><p>How <i>could</i> he?   That was the salient question in Ryoga's mind as he cried in the fold of  his arms, his entire body wracked by sobs.   How could Ranma have done such a thing?   Ryoga knew that Ranma didn't like him, the teasing and insults and  tricks showed that clearly enough, but <i>this?</i>  This was far beyond it all.   He'd been completely helpless, knowing barely anything more than his  name, yet Ranma had still taken the opportunity to be mean, to humiliate  him.   Lying to win his trust, then  acting nice to him so that when Ryoga learned the truth, it would crush him  even more.  It was bad enough that he'd  been inconsiderate to Akane throughout his memory-less haze, and the knowledge  that she knew about P-chan was enough to tear him apart, but it was the heavy  feeling of betrayal that was the most painful.   It shredded him down to the deepest part of his inner self, slashing and  tearing at him from within.  Ranma had  misled him, completely and cruelly, and no one else had even bothered to tell  him!  None of them cared enough to even  bother, not Akane or even Ukyo, and Shampoo and Mousse had even gone so far as  to try and use him.  Knowing that he meant  so little to all, these people that he'd let himself care about on some level  or another, was too much for his fragile emotions to take.</p><p>His thoughts too disjointed to do anything else, Ryoga  stayed hidden in his tiny corner by the river and cried endlessly; not noticing  the dance of the sun's final rainbowed rays upon the water as night began to  creep in, folding around him like a protective blanket that had, regretfully,  come too late to shield him from harm.</p><p>Ranma shot a dark look towards the ancient Amazon matriarch  poised on her wooden staff beside the koi pond in the Tendos' yard.</p><p>"Don't try to pin this on me, you Old Ghoul!  Amazon cure for amnesia—whose bright idea  was that?  If you were gonna bluff with  it, then why the hell didja bother to make the real stuff anyway?"</p><p>Cologne narrowed her eyes at him.  "Because some people thought that giving Ryoga a cure would be  helpful to him," she answered dryly.   "Especially since you chose not to help him yourself."</p><p>Ranma's scowl deepened.   "I was <i>about</i> to tell him everything, 'til all of you showed up!"</p><p>Cologne hmm'd in annoyance.   "Son-in-Law, the cure was made to be used only after things had been  explained to him, either by you or by us, if you hadn't agreed to the  terms.  The event that he was cured now  happened to be purely by mishap."</p><p>"Besides, if you hadn't lied to him in the first place, this  wouldn't have happened," Mousse added accusingly.</p><p>Ranma turned on him, his eyes flashing.  "Who are you to talk?  You're the one who switched the damn vials,  you idiot!  And don't go callin' me a  liar; not with all that junk you were tryin' to get him to believe that first  day!"</p><p>"The difference, Ranma Saotome, is that <i>you're </i>the  one who made him believe it, not me," Mousse retorted.</p><p>"Why you-"</p><p><i>"Stop it!" </i></p><p>Both of the young men leapt out of the way as a huge mallet  slammed down between them.  Akane yanked  it back off the ground and glared at them furiously.</p><p>"I can't believe you!   Arguing like two-year-olds over who's to blame!  Did it occur to any of you to go and <i>look  </i>for him?" she demanded.</p><p>Everyone blinked at her silently for a moment.</p><p>"Uh…that might not be a bad idea," Mousse said nervously.</p><p>Akane glanced around at everyone for a moment.  "Then let's go," she said decisively.</p><p>"Yeah, right Akane," Ranma said sardonically.  "The last time he talked to you, you hit him  so hard it knocked him down.  I'm <i>sure</i>  he'll come runnin' right to you if you find him."</p><p>The shorthaired girl clenched her fists, her face contorting  in anger.  "If you'd told me about  'P-chan' in the first place, it wouldn't have happened!"</p><p>Aside from Ranma, everyone's eyes widened.  "You found out about <i>that?" </i>Ukyo  asked incredulously.</p><p>"Of course I did," Akane said.  "Ryoga told me."</p><p>Ukyo clenched her teeth.   That threw a major wrench into the works of any future plans involving  Ryoga.  Of course, the broken heart  wasn't going to help much either.   "Rannmaaa…"</p><p>The pigtailed boy scowled again.  "It ain't like I <i>meant</i> for it happen!" he shouted.</p><p>"Oh for heaven's sake," Cologne rasped.  "Enough of this.  Go and search for him while you still have daylight on your  side."</p><p>"Is good idea," Shampoo said.</p><p>"So let's go," Ranma said impatiently.</p><p>"You can't go," Mousse said matter-of-factly, his tone condescending.  He tucked his hands into his sleeves.</p><p>Ranma whirled to face him.   "Who asked you, Duck-Boy?" he snapped.</p><p>"He's…got a point," Akane agreed, sounding somewhat  contrite.</p><p>Ranma faltered, disbelief flickering across his  features.  "What?"</p><p>Ukyo arched an eyebrow.   "Well, you said yourself that Ryoga wouldn't take seeing Akane well,"  she said, "so how do you think he'd react if he saw you?"</p><p>"You're probably the last person he wants to see," Mousse  added.</p><p>Ranma blinked.  It  suddenly seemed as though everyone there had come to be his undoing in some way  or another, all planning to tell and destroy everything or try to gain an  advantage.  He glanced around  searchingly, as though trying to find someone who might be on his side.  But it looked as though the only person who  had been was Ryoga, and that had ended about five minutes ago.  The realization made him swallow hard.</p><p>"B-but I…I didn't mean for…it wasn't supposed to…" he  stammered, trying to explain.</p><p>"Well, what did you think was going to happen?" Mousse  asked.</p><p>Shampoo glanced up at the sky, noting the sun's lower  position.  "We should go now," she said.</p><p>"Damn straight," Ukyo said.   This was nonsense; Ryoga was out running around somewhere, undoubtedly  lost and in no condition to be by himself.   She leapt up onto the wall.   "Maybe you better just sit tight, Ranchan," she said over her shoulder  before disappearing.</p><p>Akane cast a final look in Ranma's direction, then followed  Ukyo.  Mousse shrugged and took off in  another direction, and Shampoo did the same.</p><p>Ranma turned back towards the house, but everybody had  either left or gone back inside, leaving him alone in the empty yard.</p><p>It was more by accident than anything else that Ukyo found  him.</p><p>Nearly an hour had passed since Ukyo had met up with the  others and decided, resignedly, to call off the search until tomorrow.  None seemed happy with the outcome—after  all, Ryoga didn't even have his pack, which meant wherever he was, chances were  he'd be spending the night without shelter.   They'd all gone their separate ways; and the only thing Ukyo figured she  had going for her was that she was the sole person who wouldn't have to be the  bearer of bad news, as she had nothing but an empty restaurant to return  to.</p><p>It might have been this knowledge that led Ukyo, despite  being weary and worried, to continue walking through town rather than heading  home.  Full night had finally pushed  away the last of the twilight, leaving the sky overhead a wash of soft  blue-black that faded to deep violet on the horizon, broken only by the  scattering of cold white stars.   Suddenly longing to be away from the press of houses and buildings, Ukyo  headed towards the river.</p><p>Had she been on the other side, or even come from the  opposite direction, she probably would have entirely missed the form of a boy  wearing a dusky yellow shirt tucked in the corner beneath the bridge.  But she was on the same side of the river  that Ryoga was on, and she approached from the opposite end of the  support.  She happened to glance over at  the far corner as she passed under the bridge, and was startled to find him  there, his knees pulled up against his chest with his head resting in the fold  of his arms.</p><p>"Ryoga," she said, startled to find him after all the  searching they'd done.  He didn't  respond, so Ukyo walked over to him slowly, realizing that he was fast  asleep.  She stopped when she was still  a few yards away so she wouldn't wake him, but even at that distance and in the  limited light, she could plainly see the tearstains streaking his face.</p><p>She sighed softly, guilt and sympathy washing away her  initial relief.  Ryoga's clothes were  disheveled and dusty, as though he'd been under here for some time, and his  expression was pained even in slumber.   She wondered what to do—her first thought was to shake him awake and  take him home, but she was fairly certain he'd refuse, if he didn't run  outright.  Trying to knock him  unconscious wasn't an option, not with the possible ramifications that came  along with it.  Finally she looked at  the river, contemplating the liquid flow of the glittering silver water for a  moment before sighing again.  This  wasn't likely to go over well either, but she couldn't really think of anything  else.</p><p>The young woman stepped over to the water's edge, wondering  briefly how much of it was needed and how she would carry it back over to where  the Lost Boy was sitting.  Shrugging,  she knelt down and cupped her hands, but then she noticed an abandoned juice  can lying a few feet away.  Ukyo picked  it up for inspection, then pulled one of her small spatulas from her bandolier  and used it to shear off the top, leaving her with a sort of aluminum cup.  She scooped up as much water as it would  hold, then carefully carried it back under the bridge.  Pausing to hope that he wouldn't be too  furious over what she was about to do, Ukyo tossed the water at Ryoga's face.</p><p>Before the newly-awakened P-chan could untangle himself from  the heap of clothes, Ukyo caught hold of his bandana and held on tight.  Seeing who it was, the piglet began to kick  and struggle, letting out noises that were a mixture of indignation and  protest.</p><p>Ukyo lifted him so she could hold him with both hands,  despite his continued wriggling.   "C'mon, stop it already," she said.</p><p>The piglet let out another bwee of objection.  "I know," Ukyo told him, "but you can't be  out here all alone."  As if to prove her  point, the wind blew a chill breeze through, causing him to shiver violently.</p><p>"Let's get you home," Ukyo said.  "Look, you don't have to talk to any of them if you don't want  to, alright?"</p><p>P-chan emitted a final sound that let her know that no, it  was <i>not</i> alright, but the tone was now more despondent than annoyed.  Nonetheless, Ukyo kept one hand on his  bandana as she collected his clothes.   Tucking the bundle under her arm, she slipped her free hand beneath him  so he wouldn't be hanging by his neck.   Making sure she had a decent grip on both clothing and piglet, she  started the long walk home.</p><p>The town had fallen quiet with the rising of the moon, and  the lack of lighted windows indicated that most of Nerima's residents had gone  to sleep.</p><p>One of the few that remained awake sat atop the roof of the Tendo  home, watching the night as the moon began its journey across the sky.  It was cold, but Ranma paid little attention  to the chill wind that blew around him, ruffling his inky hair and cutting  through his red silk shirt.  He was too  distracted by his own thoughts to really care.</p><p>Ranma lowered his head into his arms for what seemed like  the dozenth time that night.  It had  been hours since Akane had returned home with the report that no one had found  any sign of Ryoga, and of the plan to uptake the search again in the  morning—another activity Ranma was sure he'd be pointedly excluded from.</p><p>Knowing that the Lost Boy was still out there somewhere had  him worried plenty, but knowing he was the main reason for it only served to  make it worse.  Normally, Ranma would  try to brush such things off, but there was really no way for him to get around  this one—he'd screwed up, and he'd been called on it.</p><p>Ranma squeezed his eyes shut behind his arms.  Couldn't they see he hadn't meant for this  to happen?  This had been the last thing  he'd wanted, and he'd been about to try and fix things until everyone else had  shown up and transformed what was already a mess into a complete  catastrophe.  It didn't matter to anyone  that all of them had played some part in bringing this about.  It didn't matter that in some way or  another, almost everyone had hoped to turn the situation to their  advantage.  All that seemed to matter  was that he had been the one to cause Ryoga's amnesia in the first place, and  that he had been the one to twist the truth from the very start.</p><p>And the moment they found out that Akane had learned about  Ryoga's curse, they'd assumed that their worst suspicions were true.  They figured that Ranma had done it on  purpose—another mortifying trick that probably served the double purpose of  making Akane dislike Ryoga beyond repair.</p><p>Ranma had to admit that it <i>did</i> look bad.  But it still stung that no one had even  bothered to ask him if it was true.   This wasn't what he was really concerned about though—chances were he'd  be able to clear himself of it, especially with Shampoo and Ukyo.  Akane would take some time, and by then  everyone else would've abandoned the issue entirely.</p><p>Except for one person.</p><p>And the blue-eyed martial artist doubted that he'd be able  to mend that, if he ever even got the chance.   Ranma tried to swallow down the tightness in his throat.  Ryoga had said he hated him before, but he'd  never really believed it.</p><p>Until now, that was.</p><p>And why shouldn't he, Ranma wondered dimly.  He never would've done it if he'd known it  all might go so terribly wrong, but Ryoga didn't know that.  All he knew was that Ranma had deceived him  beyond all else, and probably thought it had been done it as some sort of cruel  joke meant to ruin his relationship with Akane and humiliate him before  everyone.</p><p><i>It's not fair,</i> Ranma thought to himself.  He should've known better than to start the  whole thing, but just for once he wanted to know what it was like to have  someone who wasn't a fiancée or a rival.   He was sick of being viewed down a single, narrow track by everyone who  knew him, despite what he might do to change their perceptions.  He was always the jerk, the enemy, the  pervert, the freak, the obstacle, the half-girl, the hated one—all things he'd  never wanted to be.  And the other side  was hardly better—the fiancé, the 'husband', the coveted one, the grand  prize.  He was never accepted for who he  was, but only for who they thought he should be, who they wanted him to be, who  they saw him as.  He'd just wanted the  chance to be considered normal, to be on even ground with someone.  When Ryoga had lost his memory, the chance  had arisen; but as usual, Ranma had rushed into it headlong without really  stopping to consider the repercussions.   And now everything was in shambles.</p><p>It wouldn't be so bad if he was the only person who would  suffer for his mistake, but as with everything that happened in his life, there  were other people caught up in the middle.   Ryoga, for one, and he took everything twice as hard as anyone else  would.  Then there was Akane.  Akane, who'd found out Ryoga's secret  through a total and unprepared shock rather than easing into it as Ranma—and  Ryoga too, he figured—would have preferred to do it.  Because of him, Akane was hurt and confused, and Ryoga was  probably in emotional tatters.</p><p>Ranma winced at that particular thought and clenched his  fists, his nails digging deeply into his palms.  He was sorry for them, but he felt sorry for himself at the same  time.  No one would listen to him if he  tried to explain it all; and even if they did listen, they wouldn't  understand.  More than ever, it seemed  as though no one cared about his own feelings.   His father, trying to push him onto Akane; Akane, fighting with him and  calling him names; Ukyo and Shampoo constantly treating engagement like it was  a competition…it never seemed to stop.   Did Akane think he was unaffected by the things she said in her fits of  temper, swinging a mallet at him left and right, calling him a pervert and a  jerk?  Did Ryoga believe that his words  meant nothing; that the blame and the accusations didn't hurt?  Sure, Ranma put on a front of indifference  and an uncaring attitude, and it was true that his fast-healing ego provided a  strong shield, but he was still human underneath.  Why couldn't any of them even try to understand that?</p><p>Somehow, they'd all ended up stuck in a miserable cycle of  verbal and physical back-and-forth, a tangle of unintentional insult met with a  sharp retort or fists.  Other things  said to intimidate or anger were met with hurt and frustration.  The only thing that had resulted from it was  a web of confusion and misunderstanding—Akane jumping to the wrong conclusions,  Ryoga bristling with over-sensitivity, all taking the wrong things seriously  and the serious things unbelievingly.   Ranma felt like he was the center of it all, though most of the time he  didn't understand the reactions of the others anymore than they understood his.</p><p><i>It's not fair, </i>Ranma thought again.  Life wasn't fair—he knew that, certainly,  but sometimes it seemed as though it was even less fair for him than for so  many other people.  He wondered again  what he might be able to do to rectify the situation; and again came up with  the answer that, in all likelihood, nothing.   But he'd have to try.</p><p>Of course, finding Ryoga would be a good start.</p><p>Ranma remembered the Lost Boy's pack, still sitting in his  bedroom.  Akane and the others hadn't  found him.  That meant he could be out there  somewhere, with no food, no shelter, no money, and if he got lost…</p><p>How could they have stopped looking?</p><p>Ranma shoved himself to his feet and leapt down to the  yard.  They'd all been right, he was  probably the last person Ryoga wanted to see, but what had already happened was  bad enough.  Ranma didn't need him  wandering around hungry and cold and lost with nothing but a head injury and  the clothes he was wearing…</p><p>He ran off into the night.</p><p>Ukyo sighed as she dug through a drawer full of old clothes,  tossing random articles onto the floor.   She held up a dark blue t-shirt for inspection, then stood up, deciding  it would have to do.  She turned around  and picked up the other things she'd set aside, then headed back to the  kitchen.</p><p>"These should fit you," Ukyo said to the small black piglet  sitting on the floor.  He let out an  agitated sound in response and shook his head.   "Well, you can't wear your own," she told him.  "I put them in the wash.   You got them all dirty sitting where you did, and besides that, they  were wet."  She picked up a bath towel  from the counter and draped it over her arm as she reached for the kettle  sitting on the stove.</p><p>"It's not boiling, but I guess it should be hot enough to do  the trick," she said, turning to the piglet once more.  Ukyo started to tip it over his head, but he  backed away from the stream of water, letting it splash uselessly on the floor.</p><p>"Ryoga," she chided, though she didn't really have the heart  to be annoyed with him.  He let out an  indignant squeal and glared at her.</p><p>"I won't look, alright?" Ukyo promised.  "I'll give you the towel, and I won't open  my eyes until you say so. Ok?"</p><p>The piglet eyed her for a moment, then nodded.  Ukyo tipped the kettle again, this time  closing her eyes as she poured.  She  turned around to set the kettle on the countertop and unfolded the towel, then  held it out to where she assumed Ryoga would be.</p><p>"All the shades are down," Ukyo said, still facing away from  him.  "You can get dressed right here if  you want."  A reluctant sigh followed by  the rustle of clothing let her know that he'd complied.</p><p>"All set?" Ukyo asked after a few minutes.  Ryoga muttered something that sounded like a  yes, so she turned to face him.  The  Lost Boy appeared decidedly miserable, the impression heightened by his damp  hair and the rumpled clothes.</p><p><i>At least they fit, </i>Ukyo thought to herself, somewhat  wryly.  Lucky that she was tall for a  girl and that Ryoga wasn't that big—and that she'd lost the receipt to that  pair of pants she'd mistakenly bought in a couple sizes too large.  A small thing to go right in such a long  day.</p><p>"Well?" Ryoga said expectantly, stilling her line of  thought.  He gazed at her hollowly, his  voice flat.</p><p>"Well what?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Aren't you going to hit me or something?" he replied, as  though it should have been obvious.</p><p>She stared at him quizzically.  "Why would I do that?"</p><p>Ryoga's expression darkened into a scowl.  "It's what you usually do, when something  goes wrong," he said.</p><p>Ukyo sensed his rising upset.  "No," she said quickly.   "What happened wasn't your fault."</p><p>"That never stopped you before," Ryoga muttered.</p><p>Ukyo blinked, feeling stung.  Why was he saying these things to her?  She'd tried to be nice to him through this entire thing…  Then she realized what he meant.  He'd remembered all the times she <i>hadn't </i>been  kind, the times she had hit him for no real reason other than her own temper or  some perceived infraction.  She felt her  face color slightly with shame.</p><p>"I'm not gonna hit you," she said.  "I'm not mad at you.  If  anything, you should be mad."</p><p>Ryoga looked away.   "Why?  It's my own fault for  l-listening, and-"</p><p>Ukyo stepped forward and put a hand on his arm.  "Don't," she said quietly.  "Don't worry about all that right now."  She led him over to the table and pushed him  down into a chair.  "Sit down.  Let me get you something to eat."</p><p>"I'm not hungry," he protested, but she was already setting  a skillet on the stove and pulling out a spatula.  She went to the refrigerator and took out a bowl of batter.</p><p>"You should at least try," Ukyo said as she poured some  batter into the pan.  "It's late, and  you haven't eaten anything in hours.   Besides, you were out running around, too.  You really shouldn't have done that, you know.  Not with hurting your head and all.  I mean, it's only been a little over a  week."  She pulled a plate from one of  the cupboards as the scent of cooking okonomiyaki filled the room.  "Dr. Tofu would probably throw a fit if he  knew," Ukyo continued, trying to gracefully avoid the subject of what had  happened at the Tendos'.  "Everyone else  is going stir-crazy, not knowing where you are.  They all went to look for you, though I guess no one thought  you'd be hiding out underneath a bridge.   I don't think I'll ever understand how you end up the places you  do."  She flipped the okonomiyaki onto  the plate with a deft movement of her spatula.   "Here you go.  Don't worry,  there's not a bit of pork in it."</p><p>"I really don't think I…" Ryoga began, but Ukyo slid the  plate in front of him.</p><p>"I know you're upset, Sugar," she told him, "but anything is  better than nothing."</p><p>The bandana'd boy glanced up at her, then looked down at the  okonomiyaki.  It was perfect as always, golden  brown with just the right amount of sauce…</p><p>Ryoga shoved himself away from the table with his hand  pressed over his mouth; then turned and dashed for the bathroom.</p><p>"Ryoga?" Ukyo said bewilderedly.  A moment later, she heard him retch.  "Damn," she hissed, turning to shut off the stove.  She waited for the sound of the toilet  flushing, then ran around the corner and to the doorway.</p><p>"Ryoga?" she said anxiously, catching herself at the  doorjamb.  He was kneeling on the floor  in a heap, pale and shaking, his expression dismayed.</p><p>"S-sorry, Ukyo," he gasped, his voice beginning to  break.  "I-it's not th-that I think your  c-cooking is b-bad or anyth-thing, I j-just…"   His shoulders slumped as he trailed off, covering his eyes with his  hand.</p><p>"Oh, Ryoga," Ukyo breathed, kneeling beside him on the cool  tiles.  She put her arms around him and  pulled him close against her as he struggled to refrain from sobbing.</p><p>"It's alright," Ukyo said, resting her cheek against the  soft warmth of his hair and cursing herself once again for not having told him  before this had happened.  "Don't cry,  Ryoga-honey, please.  It'll be Ok,  really…"</p><p>AN:</p><p>You know the routine. But please don't try to convince me  that Ryoga's overreacting or something like that—he's not.  Not at all.   Trust the psych student on this one.   And no, this chapter does not guarantee a  Ryoga/Ukyo pairing.   Matter of fact, it doesn't guarantee much in the way of jack, so…stop  jumping to conclusions, O those of you who know who you are.</p><p>Itai.  ^ ^</p>
