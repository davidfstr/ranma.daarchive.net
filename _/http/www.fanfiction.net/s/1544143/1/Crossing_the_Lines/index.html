</div><p>Disclaimer: Ranma 1/2 belongs to Rumiko Takahashi  and the associated companies. I do not own the characters, nor do I claim  to own them, and no profit is being made off of this.</p><p>~Part 1~</p><p>"You jerk!  How dare you!"</p><p>Ranma felt  the wind of the punch as it flew past the side of his head, less than an inch  away.  He didn't have much time to dwell  on the distance as he dodged again, then brought up his arms to block the blow  he predicted would follow.  Correctly  predicted, he decided, trying not to wince as Ryoga's fist connected with his  forearms.  It wasn't often that he had  to actually block an attack from Ryoga; he was usually quick enough to simply  move out of the way.  But there were  certain occasions when the Lost Boy managed to put some of his anger into speed  as opposed to channeling it into his already-considerable strength.  Ranma was realizing, a bit belatedly, that  this was one of those occasions.  He  wondered dimly if it had been the comment about the bacon or the one about  falling for the long-lost fiancée routine that had pushed Ryoga into it.</p><p><i>Probably  a little of both,</i> he thought as one of the Lost Boy's punches got partially  through his block and landed a glancing blow.</p><p>"Ryoga,  c'mon!  I was kidding, stupid-"</p><p>"Shut <i>up</i>!"  Ryoga raged, all but ignoring the hit Ranma landed on his chest.</p><p>"Would  you calm down already?" the pigtailed boy asked, though he knew that would have  about as much of an effect as asking a mountain to get up and walk.  Less, probably.</p><p>"When  you're in hell!"</p><p>Ranma  sighed inwardly.  He knew he should've  learned by now to watch his mouth a little better, but he constantly forgot how  fine the line was between an insult that would goad Ryoga into a fight and one  that would sent him flying into a fit of nearly-limitless fury.  The bacon remark hadn't been nice, but Ryoga  was generally used to that kind of thing.   Bringing up the fiancée bit, on the other hand, was probably not one of  the wisest decisions Ranma had ever made.   That event was a lasting sore spot with the Lost Boy.  Which made perfect sense, Ranma  supposed—after all, he'd only embarrassed Ryoga in front of Akane and Ukyo,  toyed with his emotions, and made him feel stupid and unwanted to the point  where he'd been crying.</p><p>But that had all happened months  and months ago, so Ranma had thought it would've worn off by now.  Judging from the mix of bright anger and  underlying hurt in the Lost Boy's eyes, he was obviously wrong.</p><p>"Ryoga," Ranma tried again, ducking  as the other boy's foot swung at his head, "cut it out already.  It was a joke!"</p><p>"Do you think this is funny?" the  bandana'd boy snarled, throwing another stream of fierce punches that Ranma was  sure would hurt a great deal if they hit him.</p><p><i>Well, not anymore,</i> Ranma  thought.  And it was true.  Despite the amusement he got out of teasing  Ryoga sometimes, this was kind of extensive.   His conscience was nagging him, he was starting to get a little tired,  and perhaps the roof hadn't been the <i>best</i> of places to pick a fight…</p><p>Now, it is a well-known  fact in Nerima that there almost always seems to be some abnormal external  power of sorts hanging over the town.   Some say that Nerima is Fate's playground.  Others argue that the Nerima is one of those set places on the  Earth that is just a vortex for trouble, a Bermuda Triangle of sorts.  Others feel that it's the spot in the  universe dedicated to some higher power's experimentation with some odd  splicing of Murphy's Law and the Chaos Theory.   All of these are fairly reasonable guesses, considering.</p><p>But it could just be a whole lot of  plain bad luck for a select group of its residents.</p><p>This was what Ranma was figuring in  his mind over the next several seconds.   One moment, he and Ryoga were involved in a rather nasty fight on the  roof of the Tendo home, the next moment Ranma was aiming a kick that he didn't  really think would land while Ryoga was moving to block it.</p><p>This would've been fine, except for  the sudden intervention of the local lingerie-obsessed pervert who came sailing  through at the exact moment when it was critical that the Lost Boy's attention  be focused on Ranma's incoming attack.   And being that Ryoga's attention span had predictability equivalent to  that of a butterfly in flight, it was not surprising that he was  instantaneously distracted by the sight of a little old lecher soaring past  yelling "My sweetums!" while heading in the general direction of the  clothesline.  Therefore, instead of  completing the movement into a position that would've blocked the pigtailed  boy's kick, Ryoga ended up leaving the perfect opening.</p><p>So, one moment, Ryoga was about to  block, and the next he was glancing up at the airborne Happosai.  Then Ranma was busy thinking <i>oops</i>,  and the instant after that he was watching Ryoga flying through the air.  He had another brief moment to think about  how at least Akane wasn't around because it looked like Ryoga was headed  straight for the koi pond, then got a surprise as he realized he'd overshot the  Lost Boy's predicted landing spot.  And  instead of Ryoga falling in the relative safety of the water, he landed on the  rocks surrounding the pond itself.</p><p>Head first.</p><p>Ranma grimaced at the resulting  crack that was audible even from his place on the roof.  As he expected, Ryoga didn't look like he  was in any hurry to get back up.</p><p><i>Ah, great.  Now he'll have a headache </i>and <i>he'll  be pissed,</i> Ranma thought sourly as he leapt down off the roof and headed  over to where the other boy was lying sprawled on the ground.</p><p>"Stupid," Ranma muttered.  He looked about the yard idly as he waited  for Ryoga to come around.</p><p>Five minutes later, the yard was  getting boring.</p><p>"Come on already, moron," Ranma  said.  "Any time today is good."  Ryoga didn't move, and Ranma scowled.  He crouched down beside him and shook him  slightly.</p><p>"C'mon, P-chan, up an' at 'em."</p><p>That didn't seem to work.</p><p>"Yo!  Wakey-wakey, Pig-boy!" Ranma said loudly.</p><p>Ryoga didn't even stir.</p><p>Ranma scratched the back of his  head.  This was weird; Ryoga didn't  usually stay out cold for long.  He  shook the Lost Boy again, harder.</p><p>"Ryoga!  What the heck?  You better  not be fakin' it."</p><p>Ranma waited a long  moment.  If Ryoga was faking it, he was  doing a good job.</p><p>Ranma reached out and slapped him  lightly on the cheek.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>At this point, something that  sounded a bit like an alarm bell was going off in the back of Ranma's  mind.  Then he got an idea.</p><p>"Hey, Ryoga, Akane told me she's  got a crush on you!"</p><p>Ranma waited expectantly.  If that didn't wake him up, nothing would…</p><p>It didn't.</p><p><i>Uh-oh</i>.</p><p>Ranma did the only other thing he  could think of to do…</p><p>"KASUUUMIIIII!"</p><p>Light.</p><p>It was bright, too bright, it hurt…</p><p>Ryoga lifted a hand to cover his  eyes, letting out a low moan of pain as he moved.</p><p>"Here he is," someone said.</p><p>"Maybe you should turn off the  lamp."</p><p>Ryoga sat up slowly and tentatively  uncovered his eyes.  The light still  hurt, but it wasn't so bright anymore.   He blinked a few times, and the pain receded.  But something still wasn't right.  His head…</p><p>"Don't touch."  Someone caught his hand.</p><p>Ryoga tugged it away.  He didn't recognize that voice.</p><p>Where <i>was </i>he?</p><p>A house.  The inside of a house, near a porch.  He could see the yard.</p><p>But it wasn't where he lived.</p><p>Feeling nervous, Ryoga turned to  look at the people beside him.  There  was a girl kneeling next to him, with soft brown hair pulled into a ponytail on  her shoulder and warm brown eyes.  She  appeared to be a few years older than he was.   There was another girl standing behind her, also with brown hair, but it  was darker and shorter, only coming to her chin.  She looked to be a little older than him, maybe.  She stared at him with cool, curious eyes  that were full of appraisal and scrutiny.   He didn't like it.  A boy his age  was sitting cross-legged next to the first girl.  He had black hair, tied back in a pigtail, and was wearing  Chinese-style clothes.  His eyes were  dark blue, and he was gazing at him attentively and looking a little worried.  There was another girl beside the boy, with  short blue-black hair and concerned brown eyes.</p><p>"How do you  feel, Ryoga?" asked the oldest girl in a sweet, kind voice.  She smiled warmly.</p><p>Ryoga blinked at her, his feeling  of anxiety deepening despite the kind voice and gentle aura surrounding  her.  She'd used his name…</p><p>"It's about time ya woke up," added  the boy.  Any worry that may have been  there was gone, replaced by a look of uncaring nonchalance.  "Huh.   I woulda thought your head was hard enough so that you wouldna even  conked out in the first place."</p><p>Ryoga didn't reply, and the boy  looked at him oddly.  "Yo, what's the  matter with you?  You forget how to talk  or somethin', P-chan?"</p><p>Ryoga glanced around at them all  once more, trying to figure out what was going on.  The way they were talking, it was like…</p><p>But that couldn't be.</p><p>Ryoga was positive that he'd never  seen any of these people before in his life.</p><p>Ranma blinked at the boy sitting in  front of him, wondering at the silence.   Sure, Ryoga had landed pretty hard, but he was still acting awfully  weird.  Ranma tipped his head to one  side as the Lost Boy stared at him blankly.</p><p>"Ryoga?  Anybody home?" Ranma asked.</p><p>The other boy swallowed.  "Um…do I know you?"</p><p>Ranma could practically feel his  jaw hit the floor.</p><p>"Oh, my," Kasumi said.</p><p>It took a long moment for the  pigtailed boy to shake off his surprise.   "Oh, I get it," he drawled.   "Yeah, funny Ryoga.  You almost  had me goin' there for a second."</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow.  "Since when did he become a practical  joker?"</p><p>Ryoga glanced between the two for a  moment, then looked at Kasumi.  "I-I  hope you don't think me rude," he said.   "But…how do you know my name?"</p><p>"Ah, get off it already!" Ranma  said, his voice filling with annoyance.</p><p>Ryoga frowned slightly.  "What are you talking about?" he asked,  sounding genuinely confused.</p><p>"C'mon!" Ranma snapped, a scowl  settling on his features.</p><p>Akane elbowed him.  "Ranma…I don't think he's fooling," she  said, her voice hushed.</p><p>Ranma turned back to the Lost Boy  and stared at him hard.  Ryoga looked  back at him for a moment, then fidgeted uncomfortably and dropped his  gaze.  "Why are you looking at me like  that?" he asked.</p><p>Ranma sat back on his heels, his  expression slowly drifting back to shock.</p><p>Kasumi cleared her throat  quietly.  "Ryoga dear, do you remember  falling?"</p><p>"Falling?  I fell?"</p><p>Kasumi hmm'd worriedly.  Then she heard a knock at the front door and  stood.</p><p>"I hope that's the doctor," Akane  said.</p><p>"In that case…" Nabiki said,  trailing after Kasumi for damage control.</p><p>Ryoga glanced at the two left in  the room with him, then quickly looked at the floor.  Ranma kept his eyes trained on him, thinking hard.</p><p>"Well, it  looks like you have a bit of a concussion," Dr. Tofu said.  "How did you say this happened?"</p><p>"Um…I  didn't," Ryoga said quietly.  "I don't  really know."</p><p>"You fell  off the roof and hit the rocks by the pond," Ranma said.</p><p>"The roof?"  Ryoga asked.</p><p>Ranma  decided to skip elaborating for the time being.  "Dr. Tofu, does he really have amnesia?"</p><p>Dr. Tofu  frowned thoughtfully.  "Well…he doesn't  seem to remember you, or Akane, or anyone else here…"</p><p>Ryoga  looked at them in consternation.  "How  could I possibly remember you?  I don't  even know you!"</p><p>"Ryoga,"  Dr. Tofu said patiently.  "When you woke  up, you knew your name, right?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Do you  remember where you live?"</p><p>Ryoga  frowned.  "Yes, I…I live in…"  He trailed off, his expression a mixture of  confusion and astonishment.</p><p>Akane and  Ranma exchanged glances, but the doctor seemed unfazed.</p><p>"Do you  know where your parents are?"</p><p>Ryoga's  face paled.  "…my parents?"</p><p>"When was  the last time you were home?"</p><p>Ryoga's  expression became dismayed.  "I was…I  c-can't…"</p><p>"Alright,"  Dr. Tofu said calmingly.  "What's the  last thing you remember?"</p><p>Ryoga tried  to concentrate.  "I don't…I've been  traveling, lately…"</p><p>"Do you  remember where you've been?"</p><p>Ryoga  thought for a moment, then shook his head.</p><p>"Do you  know where you are now?" Dr. Tofu asked.</p><p>Ryoga  glanced around him nervously, his eyes filling with uneasy fear.  "No," he said, his voice small.</p><p>"Alright,"  the doctor said.  "It looks like you  really do have amnesia.  But almost all  people with amnesia regain their memories, eventually.  The chance that you won't get it back is  practically nonexistent."</p><p>"But how  long will that take?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"It  depends," Dr. Tofu said.  "Not too long,  hopefully.  But it could take as much as  a couple months…or even longer.  But  that's not likely."  He turned to  Akane.  "Akane, will your father mind if  Ryoga stays here?  He really shouldn't  be out traveling with a head injury."</p><p>Akane  nodded.  "I'm sure he won't mind.  Especially since this is all Ranma's fault  anyway."</p><p>"Hey!"  Ranma said indignantly.</p><p>Ryoga  glanced at him, a dark look settling over his features.  "Your fault?  <i>You</i> made me fall?"</p><p>Ranma  scratched the back of his head nervously.   "Um…well, sorta.  But it was an  accident!  We were…sparring!  You know, martial arts?  You remember that, right?"</p><p>"Yes…"  Ryoga said slowly.</p><p>"Yeah,  well, we were practicing.  The Old Freak  kinda got in our way, and I knocked you off by accident," Ranma continued  quickly.</p><p>"Old  Freak?" Ryoga said dubiously.</p><p>Akane  arched her eyebrow suspiciously.  It  looked like Ranma was up to something…</p><p>"I'll go  tell Kasumi to set up an extra bed," Akane told Dr. Tofu.</p><p>"Wait a  minute!" Ryoga cried, his eyes widening.   "I can't just…I'm fine, I don't need to stay here!"</p><p>"Well, we  can't just let you go wandering around Japan," Dr. Tofu said.  "Besides, someone needs to keep an eye on  you for a few days, just to make sure you don't have any complications."</p><p>"But I…I  don't even know any of you…" Ryoga protested vainly.  Dr. Tofu was already explaining to Kasumi in flustered stammers  what to watch for and what to do if something happened, leaving Ryoga kneeling  on the mat, looking unhappy, nervous, and very lost.</p><p>Ranma  noticed this and stepped forward, feeling sympathetic (and, though he didn't  want to admit it, rather guilty).  He  crouched down in front of the Lost Boy.</p><p>"Hey, don't  worry.  You know us, you just don't  remember.  But since you're gonna be  stayin' here for awhile, how 'bout I show you around?  I mean, you used to know, but I guess everything must look pretty  strange now, huh.  Whaddaya say?"</p><p>Ryoga  glanced at him apprehensively.  Come to  think of it, he did look kind of familiar.   But there was something nagging at the back of Ryoga's mind, something  about him…  He decided to ignore it for  the time being.  "Ok, I guess…"</p><p>Akane saw  Ryoga climbing to his feet beside Ranma and frowned.</p><p>"Come on,  I'll show ya the yard first."</p><p>Ryoga  paused, peering at him curiously as he remembered his supposed accident.  "I'm supposed to know you," he said slowly,  and Ranma nodded.</p><p>"Were we…friends?"</p><p>Ranma blinked once, considering the  opportunity that had just been put in front of him.  He hesitated for the briefest of moments to wonder if what he was  about to do was such a good idea, but he quickly brushed off any lingering  doubts.  He'd burn any bridges when he  came to them.</p><p>"Sure," Ranma said, an easygoing  smile sliding onto his face.  "The  best..."</p>
