</div><p>Disclaimer:  Ranma ½  belongs to Rumiko Takahashi, secondly to Viz Communications, Fuji, Kitty, and  Shogakukan.  I'm just borrowing the  characters for this fic, which is certainly not making any sort of profit.</p>You came in with the  breeze<p>On Sunday morning</p><p>You sure have changed since yesterday</p><p>Without any warning</p><p>I thought I knew you</p><p>I thought I knew you</p><p>I thought I knew you well…so well…</p><p>~No Doubt, "Sunday Morning"</p><p>The following afternoon was bright and sunny, with a deep  blue sky dotted with the occasional puffy white cloud.  A nearly perfect day; with the birds singing  cheerfully as a pleasant breeze ruffled through the tree leaves, making them  rustle in harmony.</p><p>Ranma sat cross-legged on one of the rocks lining the koi  pond in the backyard as the later hours began to set in, a petulant scowl  settled firmly on his features.</p><p>"Stupid Nabiki," he muttered under his breath, acutely aware  of how thin his wallet felt in his pocket.   The middle Tendo sister had insisted upon a larger sum than Ranma felt  was fair, but he wasn't really in much of a position to argue.  Though by paying her off, he could at least  rest assured that there were no other threats to Ryoga's amnesia except for  natural recovery.  Akane had rendered  herself pretty much unable—after being exposed to her temper those few times,  the Lost Boy had made it a point to avoid being alone with her.  Shampoo or Mousse might try something, but  Ranma figured they would both find Ryoga's lack of memory more advantageous  than not.  And besides that, Ranma could  easily avoid any of them having any effect whatsoever—all he had to do was keep  them away.</p><p><i>Or maybe you should just stop this whole thing and tell  him the truth before something goes completely wrong, </i>suggested a little  voice in the back of Ranma's head.</p><p>The pigtailed boy's scowl deepened.  He was beginning to worry over how long he  could keep this up.  Every moment he  prolonged this was a growing risk in and of itself, Ryoga could get his memory  back any time now…</p><p>But if Ranma told everything now, things would go back to  normal and Ryoga would hate him again, more than he had before even,  maybe.  If only he could find some way  to do it without ruining it all, maybe if he explained to Ryoga first why he  hadn't told him the complete truth…</p><p>But he needed some time to figure out how.</p><p>One more day, Ranma decided.  Just one more day.  He'd  figure something out by then, and then he'd deal with this.  Though in the meantime, he'd try to keep the  others away, just in case.</p><p>Which should really be no problem at all, since the Lost Boy  had been sticking pretty close to him lately anyway.  After all, he thought that…</p><p>Then Ranma noticed something rather important.</p><p>Ryoga wasn't out here with him now.</p><p>With a start, Ranma quickly glanced around the yard.  The bandana'd boy had been over by the porch  just a moment ago, hadn't he?</p><p><i>Don't tell me the idiot managed to wander off, </i>Ranma  thought as he jumped off his rock.  <i>I  was just startin' to think he'd forgotten his crazy sense of direction with  everything else- </i></p><p>Ranma's thoughts were cut off by the sound of someone  talking coming from around the corner of the house.  And it sounded like Akane…</p><p>Ranma started across the yard.</p><p>"Hello, Ryoga," piped a bright, feminine voice.</p><p>Ryoga turned around warily to look up at the youngest Tendo  daughter from his spot on the porch.   "Uh, hi, Akane," he replied nervously.   He still wasn't quite sure what to make of the girl.  She'd seemed so nice at first, but then  she'd gotten so short-tempered and violent.   All in all, she'd come across as someone Ryoga thought he should  probably avoid until he had her figured out better.</p><p>Akane smiled at him cheerfully.  "Would you come with me?   I want to talk to you about something."</p><p>Ryoga swallowed hard.   "O-oh," he replied, casting an anxious glance over his shoulder.  Ranma was sitting by the pond, seemingly  oblivious as to what was going on.  No  help there.  He turned back to  Akane.  At least she looked like she was  in a good mood this time.</p><p>"Ok," he said, a little reluctantly.  He followed her as she led him around the  corner of the house.  A place that  seemed as though it would be safely out of anyone's earshot, Ryoga noticed as he  watched a small bird take flight from the wooden feeder standing there.  He put a hand behind his head to tug at the  knot on his bandana.  "So, uh, what did  you want to talk to me about?"</p><p>"Well, actually, I wanted to apologize," Akane told him.</p><p>Ryoga blinked.   "Apologize?"</p><p>Akane nodded.  "I was  thinking, and I realized that I haven't been very friendly towards you  lately."  She tipped her head to one  side.  "I know you still don't remember,  but we were friends too, Ryoga."</p><p>The Lost Boy's expression was sliding rapidly towards  confusion.  "R-really?  I mean, Ranma told me that-"</p><p>"Ranma's not always…completely honest," Akane interrupted  him.  "Don't get me wrong," she  continued quickly.  "You've, uh,  been…friends with him for a long time and all, but he <i>does </i>have this  tendency to stretch the truth sometimes."</p><p>Ryoga frowned.  "Are  you saying he's a liar?"</p><p>"No, no," Akane said, becoming somewhat flustered.  "He's usually honest…well, sort of,  anyway.  Not that he hasn't lied before,  because he has.  But it's not like he  lies all the time.  It's just that he's  kind of…self-serving."</p><p>"Self-serving?" Ryoga echoed.  He looked at her uncertainly.   "What exactly do you mean?"</p><p>Akane's expression became serious.  "Well…if Ranma can find a way to turn a situation to his  advantage, he does it.  But sometimes he  forgets that there are other people involved, you know?"</p><p>Ryoga glanced at the ground, feeling unsettled.  He didn't like what he was hearing much, but  Akane didn't have any reason to lie to him, did she?  But then again, if what she said was true, what reason would  Ranma have to lie to him?</p><p>"Turn a situation to his advantage.  That's not really farfetched though, is it?"  Ryoga asked carefully.  "I mean, he <i>is</i>  a martial artist and all.  And he  doesn't exactly have it easy…"</p><p>"Huh?" Akane said, her voice high with surprise.  She still wasn't used to hearing Ryoga  defend him.</p><p>The bandana'd boy shrugged.   "You know…I mean, no offense or anything, but it's hard being engaged at  our age, right?"</p><p>Akane blinked.  "Um,  sure, I guess, but I don't think you're getting my point.  He doesn't always have to do things the way  he does them, especially when people might get hurt."</p><p>"But there's all those other girls he's supposed to marry,  too," Ryoga said.  "Doesn't that make it  kind of hard for someone <i>not</i> to end up hurt?  Maybe he doesn't feel like he really has a choice.  And he's trying to deal with his curse at  the same time."</p><p><i>No choice?</i>   Akane thought to herself.  <i>If  you only knew…</i>  She looked at the Lost  Boy again, musing.  Poor Ryoga, he  didn't have a clue.</p><p>"But Ryoga, Ranma manages to even use his curse to his  advantage sometimes," she explained.   "He can be really shameless about it."</p><p>"Huh.  Even so, you  can hardly blame him there," Ryoga said.   "It's not like having a curse that turns you into a girl every time you  get wet can be easy or anything.  I know  it sure isn't easy having one that turns you into a little pig."</p><p>Akane started to reply, but stopped suddenly, her eyes  growing wide.  "Wh-what did you say?"</p><p>Ryoga glanced at her innocently.  "Oh…you didn't know about that?"</p><p>"Know about what?" Akane said slowly.</p><p>"The curse.  I guess  I was in China…"</p><p>Ukyo Kuonji slid the restaurant door shut behind her with a  decisive snap.</p><p>Another night spent tossing and turning over the situation  with Ryoga's amnesia.  Another night  debating whether to let Ranma have his way or do what seemed right.  Another night spent practically without  sleep.</p><p>At least she'd come to a decision.</p><p>Whatever was going on, Ukyo didn't like it.  She didn't like it that Ranma had been  lying.  She didn't like it that poor  Ryoga was being left in the dark while no one did anything about it.</p><p>And she didn't like losing her damn sleep.</p><p>So unless Ranma had some really good explanations up his  sleeve, she was going to set things straight with Ryoga.</p><p>Right now.</p><p>Shampoo ran along the top of the chain link fence lining the  sidewalk, an excited smile painted on her face.  In her hand, she clutched the vial that would, one way or  another, get her a date with Ranma.</p><p>Or more.  That would  be fine, too.</p><p>Shampoo increased her pace.   She could hardly wait…</p><p>From the roof of the Cat Café, Mousse watched Shampoo take  off down the street, headed towards the Tendo Dojo.</p><p>Even though he didn't have to worry about Saotome anymore,  he still wanted to see what would happen.   Besides, it would look strange if he didn't tag along after her.  He leapt down from the roof, nearly fell  when his foot landed on an abandoned soda can he hadn't seen, then started to  follow.</p><p>"Hold it!" shouted a grating voice from behind him.  Before he could even turn around, he was  smacked over the head with something hard.</p><p>From his new seat on the ground, Mousse glared up at  Cologne, rubbing the bump made by her staff.</p><p>"What'd you do that for, you Old Ghoul?"</p><p>Cologne shot him a withering look from her perch.  "Don't get mouthy with me, Mr.  Part-time.  And don't even think about  chasing after Shampoo when she's going to see Son-in-Law."</p><p>Mousse scowled at her.   "What's it to you?"</p><p>"You are not going to interfere," Cologne said firmly.</p><p>Mousse stood up with as much dignity as he could  muster.  "Well," he said smugly.  "It's too late."</p><p>The old Amazon frowned at him.  "And just what do you mean by that?"</p><p>Mousse tucked his hands in the sleeves of his robe.  "Hmm.   It will be awfully hard to convince Ranma of anything, considering the  powder Shampoo took is useless."</p><p>Cologne's eyes narrowed.   "Mousse, what have you been up to?"</p><p>"I switched the vial with one I found in the kitchen.  So the one Shampoo has is full of harmless  spice.  Guess that ruins your little  plan, doesn't it?"</p><p>"You fool!" Cologne shouted.  "Do you realize what you've done?  The vial Shampoo had was full of flour, nothing more!  By switching the vials, you've made her take  the potion instead!"</p><p>Mousse felt himself go slack.  "Wh-what?"</p><p>"You bumbling idiot," Cologne groaned.  "If any of that powder gets on Ryoga, he'll  regain his memory!  And if Son-in-Law  has not yet…oooh, go after her, you fool!   There's more than a date at stake here!"</p><p>"Uh…right!" Mousse managed, breaking into a run as Cologne  followed after on her staff.  If Ryoga  regained his memory, and Ranma got mad at Shampoo for it, and Shampoo knew that  he'd switched the vials …</p><p>Mousse ran faster.</p><p>Ranma bounded over to where Ryoga and Akane were standing,  hoping that disaster hadn't struck yet.   The moment he'd overheard the word "curse", he'd known there was about  to be trouble.  Ranma prepared himself  to…interrupt, cover Akane's ears, clap his hand over Ryoga's mouth, something,  anything…</p><p>Even from a couple yards away, he felt the anger in Akane's  aura skyrocket.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Ranma winced at the resounding slap.  Chances were his sympathy would be turning  to empathy right quick; he figured Akane had one saved for him.</p><p>"What was that for?" Ryoga asked bewilderedly.  The blow had knocked him to the ground.  He stared up at Akane, his eyes somehow  filled with confusion, anger, and hurt all at the same time.</p><p>"You…" she sputtered, her fists clenching reflexively as she  stepped forward.</p><p>"Akane, don't," Ranma warned, leaping between her and the  boy on the ground and spreading his arms defensively.  "He doesn't remember."</p><p>Akane's expression darkened further.  "You <i>knew</i>, didn't you," she  said.  "You knew all along, you <i>jerk!"</i>  She raised her hand.</p><p>"Wait!  It's not what  you think," Ranma said hurriedly.  He  ducked as she swung at him.  "Quit  it!  Akane, you can beat me up later all  you want, and you can beat Ryoga up too, but you can't go hitting him when he  don't even understand why!"</p><p>"Why should I listen to <i>you?" </i>Akane shrieked.  She aimed a vicious kick at his head.</p><p>Ranma ducked again.   "Because, he don't even know why you're doing it, and in case you  forgot, he landed headfirst on a bunch of rocks just a week ago!"</p><p>Akane faltered slightly.   Ranma was right.  If she really  let it loose on Ryoga now, it could, in a worst-case scenario, kill him.  She <i>was</i> angry, but she certainly  wasn't <i>that</i> angry.</p><p>The brief halt in her fury allowed the second pressing  emotion to surface.</p><p>Ryoga had deceived her.   And Ranma had deceived her.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>Akane dropped out of her stance.  "F-fine," she said.</p><p>Ranma relaxed a little, more out of surprise than  anything.  Akane was listening to  reason.  It was almost amazing…</p><p>"I'll just settle for hitting <i>you!" </i>she shouted.  Her fist connected with his jaw, sending him  flying into a newly-standing Ryoga, who immediately found himself back on the  ground.</p><p>"Ow,"  Ranma muttered.  He lifted his head and  watched Akane run off, obviously in tears, then shifted himself off of the  other young man.</p><p>"Are you alright?" Ranma asked, clambering to his feet.  Ryoga nodded mutely, looking completely lost  as he knelt in the grass.  He appeared  almost exactly as he had so many days before after he'd woken up—unhappy and  confused, his eyes no longer trusting but nervous and uncertain.</p><p>"What's going on?" he asked, his voice small.</p><p>Ranma sighed.   Apparently, he'd have to do this right now instead of tomorrow.  So much for the best-laid plans.</p><p>"I can explain," the blue-eyed martial-artist said, unable  to keep all despondence from his voice.   He'd have to wing it as best as he could…</p><p>But of course, he didn't get the chance.</p><p>"Airen!"</p>
