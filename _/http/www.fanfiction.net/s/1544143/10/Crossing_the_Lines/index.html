</div><p>Disclaimer:  Don't own 'em,  don't claim to own 'em, don't sue me.</p><p>Warning:  Friends, Romans,  potential flamers, lend me your ears.   Or rather your eyes, as you're reading this, not hearing it.  This chapter is on the harsh side.  I'm really not kidding (well, I didn't think  it was all that earth-shatteringly horrible, but when it was up on my webpage,  a lot of other people did).  Before,  there was angst.  Now, there  is…uber-angst.  Ryoga has a flashback,  and it is not nice.  However, it is not  crucial to the plot that you read the flashback, it is mostly there for  emotional effect—so if you are at all worried, I am telling you now to <i>skip  the big italicized part in the middle.</i>   I mean it.</p><p>Despite warning people about this on my page, I still took a lot of  heat for it later.  So this time around,  I mean to thoroughly get my point across.   If you don't think you'll like it, do. Not. Read. It.  And now that you've been so thoroughly  warned, let me also make this clear—I will absolutely, positively not tolerate  any flames regarding the content contained in the flashback.  So if you read it despite my warnings and  decide you hate it…tough patooties.   Don't bother wasting time with flames, because I'll be deleting them as  soon as they appear.</p><p>Other than that…'njoy ^ ^.</p><p>Part 10</p><p><i>I sit here locked inside my head</i><i><br/>Remembering everything you've said<br/>This silence gets us nowhere<br/>Gets us nowhere </i></p><p><i>Way too fast…</i><i><p></p></i></p><p>~Staind, "For You"</p><p><i>In a little while<br/>I'll be gone<br/>The moment's already passed<br/>Yeah it's gone<br/>And I'm not here<br/>This isn't happening<br/>I'm not here<br/>I'm not here…</i></p><p>~Radiohead, "How to Disappear Completely"</p><p>Shampoo held back a sigh as she wiped down the last table  with her cloth, then tossed it into the bucket at her feet.  It had been a long and busy night, one that  hadn't been made any easier by her uncharacteristically heavy thoughts.</p><p>Picking up the bucket and her spray bottle of disinfectant,  Shampoo trudged to the kitchen.  She  could hear her grandmother dealing with the money and paperwork in the back  room, and Mousse was standing at the sink, washing the last of the dishes.  Without saying anything, Shampoo walked to  the rear door and emptied the bucket outside.   She paused for a moment, watching as the grayish water swirled towards  the storm drain a few yards down the alley.   Then she went back inside and busied herself with putting away the  cleaning supplies.</p><p>A few minutes later, Shampoo stood up from where she had  been crouched on the floor.  She was  tired, not just from the work, but from what had happened over the past two  days as well.  Just thinking about it  made her feel exhausted.  She reached  behind her back to untie her apron.  The  entire situation was so impossibly complicated that she couldn't imagine how it  would ever be brought to a resolution—if it could be brought to a resolution,  that was.</p><p>Shampoo was so preoccupied with her thoughts that she didn't  notice that Mousse was finished with what he was doing and had turned around to  look at her.  She tugged at the stubborn  knot she was trying to untie, grimacing slightly in annoyance as it refused to  come undone.</p><p>"How long are you going to stay mad at me for this time?"  Mousse asked abruptly.</p><p>Shampoo spun around on the ball of her foot to face  him.  "What?" she said, surprised that  he'd spoken after the hours of silence that had been between them.</p><p>Mousse had pushed his glasses back on his forehead,  revealing his turquoise eyes.  "Or maybe  you haven't decided yet," he said, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>Shampoo dropped her gaze to the floor.  Annoying as it could be, she often felt  Mousse was easier to deal with when he was acting ridiculously lovesick and  overwrought.  This calmer, more serious  person he became when something significant enough to bring him down to earth  occurred wasn't so easily dismissed with the usual insults and brush-offs.</p><p>Finally succeeding in pulling the knot loose, Shampoo began  to shrug the frilly apron off her shoulders.   "Shampoo not mad at stu-…at Mousse," she said quietly.</p><p>Instead of breaking into some joyous babble of hopefulness  and gratitude, Mousse simply raised his eyebrows.  "Why not?"</p><p>Shampoo kept her eyes downcast.  "Because, Shampoo should have seen that plan likely go bad from  start," she answered him.  "They usually  do," she muttered.</p><p>Mousse blinked.   "You…you mean you're giving up on him?" he asked, his voice a mixture of  confusion, shock, and hope.</p><p>Shampoo clenched her fists and glared at him, her voice  rising.  "Shampoo no say that!" she  snapped, her tone heated.  She felt an  unwanted twinge of guilt at the expression her words brought to Mousse's face.</p><p>"I didn't really think so," he said, unable to keep all the  despondence from his voice.  "But if you  aren't mad, then why are you being so…so…"</p><p>Shampoo repressed a tired sigh.  She twisted her apron in her hands, causing the delicate flower  print to contort and make the tiny pink blooms appear broken and crushed.  She knew she could shake it out and they  would return to normal instantly, becoming straight and full, almost as if  nothing had happened at all.  If only  everything were that easy.</p><p>"You know why," she said finally.</p><p>Mousse glanced up at her again and eyed her silently for a  long moment.  "If I hadn't switched the  vials-"</p><p>"And if Shampoo no had make powder," Shampoo interrupted  him, "and if Ranma no had said bad lie.   Then this no happen."  Now she  did sigh, closing her eyes wearily.   "Many mistakes, not just Mousse's.   And if what happened no happen, then who say something else not happen  instead?"</p><p>"I…I know," Mousse replied.   "You're right, none of us should've…I just wish…" he trailed off  momentarily.  "Why did it have to be  this bad?" he said finally, his voice tight with frustration.  "No one deserves something like that, but  why did it have to be <i>him?"</i></p><p>Shampoo clutched her apron, wondering the exact same  thing.  It was true that neither of them  was very close to Ryoga, and it was true that the Lost Boy could be annoying on  occasion, but at the same time, Shampoo couldn't think of a single person who  had deserved it less.  He had little to  do with her pursuit of Ranma, and next to nothing to do with Mousse's pursuit  of her.  He should've remained aside  from these matters in the first place, not been dragged into them without even  knowing.  As if that weren't bad enough,  she knew that as a person, just for who he was, Ryoga shouldn't have wound up  on the receiving end of something like this.   He rarely wished harm on others, while in contrast so many of them were  largely careless as to what happened to someone who got in their way.  There was the whole situation with Ranma of  course, but even Shampoo knew that was half bluster rather than true intent on  Ryoga's part—in spite of himself, Ryoga was almost always one of the first to  jump in and help, to be willing to risk himself for someone else.  And perhaps worst of all was that Shampoo  knew that of the memories that had been brought back into Ryoga's awareness,  very few of them were likely to be happy ones.   From what she knew of his life, she could put it together well enough,  and she knew exactly what the ability to do a perfect Shi-shi Hokodan  meant.</p><p>"It have to be him…because Ranma no would do that to anyone  else," Shampoo said at last.</p><p>"He's a bastard for it, Shampoo," Mousse said  vehemently.  "If he wanted to keep Ryoga  away from Akane, fine.  But he didn't  have to do it like that."</p><p>Shampoo lifted her head.   "Shampoo no think that why Ranma do it," she told him.  "Maybe small part for that.  But that not real reason."</p><p>"Then what <i>was</i> the reason?" Mousse demanded.</p><p>"I don't <i>know," </i>she said forcefully, slipping into  Cantonese as she did when she was too frustrated to express things  otherwise.  "It just…I'm sure it wasn't because  he thought it would…something's not right about it all-"</p><p>"Shampoo!"  Cologne's  voice came from the other room, the tone scolding.  "You're in Japan, speak the right language!"</p><p>Both of the young people took a moment to shoot a petulant  look towards the doorway.  "Yes,  Great-grandmother," Shampoo said loudly.   Then she turned back to Mousse.   "It no matter anyway," she said to him.   "What done is done."</p><p>Mousse uncrossed his arms and clenched his fists.  "How can you still defend him?" he  snapped.  "I know you're not just going  to stop chasing after him for this, but how can you say it doesn't matter?  Didn't you see the look on Ryoga's  face?  Do you think it doesn't matter to  <i>him?"</i></p><p>Shampoo bit her lip and stared at the floor.  She should be angry at him for speaking to  her like this, she should want to yell at him, to hit him hard enough to send  him down the block…but she didn't.  She  wanted to cry.</p><p>In response to her prolonged silence, Mousse let out an  exasperated sigh.  She heard the soft  swish of his robe as he turned, followed by the sound of his retreating  footsteps.  A few moments later, Shampoo  heard him going up the stairs, and then, an audible thud as he restrained  himself from slamming his bedroom door shut.</p><p>Knowing he was gone, Shampoo finally released the breath  she'd been holding back for so long.   She wondered how things had managed to go so wrong so quickly.  Things had a tendency to go awry around here,  but this was different.  This was too  much to simply brush off within the space of a few days.  This time, things had gone too far.</p><p>Shampoo went to hang her apron on the hook by the door.  She thought about how Mousse was  acting.  It was almost strange, having  him be really and truly angry with her, though she knew part of it was because  he was feeling so awful himself.  She  considered the things he'd said to her, and supposed he was right in a way—she  shouldn't have said that it didn't matter; not with the part she had played,  not with what had happened to Ryoga.   She knew she'd acted wrongly, and even she had to admit that Ranma had  done so, too.  And yes, she had seen the  look on Ryoga's face.</p><p>But she'd seen the look on Ranma's face as well.</p><p>Shampoo wasn't sure precisely what his motives were, but she  was certain that they weren't what Mousse suspected, and she was sure that he  hadn't been doing it as some sort of terrible joke.  It couldn't be.  Because  after Ryoga's memory had returned, after he'd leapt at Ranma in full fury,  after he'd said those last, terribly sincere little words, Ranma hadn't looked  like someone who'd been playing a joke.</p><p>He'd looked like someone who had just lost his best friend.</p><p><i>Somewhere in the middle of a city, he was lost yet again</i>.<i>  Osaka, perhaps, but it was hard to tell for  certain</i>. <i> He was tired—exhausted,  actually</i>. <i> He'd been wandering  around without food or real sleep for over two days now</i>.<i>  Something had happened to activate his  curse, but his thoughts were too muddled at the moment to remember exactly what</i>.<i>  He'd been near the outskirts of the city  when he changed; he'd fallen in a creek or a ditch maybe</i>. <i> His pack was gone, he'd had to leave it  eventually when he got too tired to drag it any farther</i>. <i> He hadn't been able to heat up water…why  hadn't he been able to heat up water?   It was wet, Ryoga remembered</i>.<i>   It had been raining the day before, making the grass and any wood too  wet for a fire, and he was out of the cartridges that fueled his tiny camp  burner</i>. <i> He'd walked to the city  in his cursed form, and had gotten hot water somewhere</i>. <i> A tea house?   A vendor?  Something like that</i>.<i>  Lucky for him, he'd changed back with his  clothes</i>.<i>  But he had no money,  and though he was used to being delayed by having to look for his pack, it  usually didn't take him more than a few hours to find it</i>. <i> This time was different though, he couldn't  even find his way out of here, much less find his possessions</i>. <i> The streets were an increasingly puzzling  maze to him, and were only becoming ever the more confusing as his body started  using his last reserves of energy to simply keep moving</i>.  </p><p><i>Ryoga halted in his steps and leaned against the side of  a building he was next to</i>.<i>  His  head ached, and the bouts of dizziness he'd been feeling since the day before  were becoming more frequent and prolonged</i>.<i>  There were sharp, stabbing pains in his midsection, accompanied  by a dull throb in his lower back as his body protested against the lack of  food</i>.<i>  Ryoga glanced up to look  at his surroundings</i>. <i> He was in  some sort of long, shadowy alleyway that was empty but for some battered scraps  of newspaper and sparkling remains of broken bottles</i>.<i>  He didn't much the like the idea of staying  in such a place for very long, but he knew if he didn't rest soon, he would  risk losing consciousness in an even worse place later</i>. </p><p><i>Ryoga made his way down the narrow street, keeping one  hand on the side of the building for support</i>. <i> After a few minutes of half-walking, half-staggering, he came to a  doorway</i>.<i>  It was set a good two feet  into the wall, and the handle had a large padlock securing it</i>. <i> Judging by the amount of rust on the lock, he  guessed that the door hadn't been used in a long time</i>. <i> Ryoga sighed</i>. <i> It wasn't the best of shelters, but it would  have to do for now</i>.<i>  Trying to  ignore the multitude of aches, he eased himself into the doorway, leaning his  back against one side and drawing his knees up as far as he needed in order to  fit inside</i>.<i>  It wasn't the most  comfortable of places to sit, but Ryoga knew from experience that it could be  worse</i>.<i>  He crossed his arms over  his chest for warmth and rested his head against the door as weariness overtook  him</i>.<i>  There was little else he  could do but hope that he would find his way out of here when awoke</i>.</p><p><i>Ryoga was just starting to doze off when he heard the  sound of feet scuffing on the pavement, followed by a low mutter of voices</i>.  <i>He shifted himself awake, realizing that  they were drawing closer</i>.<i>  But  he'd barely opened his eyes to let in what light was managing to filter its way  into the alley before a shadow cast itself over him</i>.</p><p><i>"Well now, what do we have here?" </i></p><p><i>Ryoga glanced up quickly, alarmed that he'd actually  allowed someone to get this close before he was fully aware of it</i>.<i>  Standing in front of the doorway was a man  dressed in torn jeans and a black jacket</i>.<i>  Ryoga couldn't see his face well, both because the man's back was  to what limited light there was, and because he wasn't in much of a position to  tip his head back very far</i>.<i>   Ryoga tried to look past him, and saw that there were more men grouping  behind the one closest to the doorway, dressed in similar clothing</i>.<i>  They looked fairly young, older than he was  certainly, but none of them could be older than thirty, if that</i>. <i> Judging by the way they were dressed and the  number of them, they were a street gang of some sort</i>.<i>  Ryoga felt a tremor of nervousness trying to  loose itself in him, but he fought it back as best he could</i>.<i>  Trying not to let his body betray him, he  stood up, a task made all the more difficult by the close proximity of the man,  who didn't do the courtesy of stepping back to give Ryoga room</i>.</p><p><i>"What do you want?" Ryoga asked, keeping his back to the  door as he got a better look at the individual in front of him</i>.<i>  His features were sharp and defined, and his  eyes were an icy shade of gray that was almost unnerving in its intensity</i>. <i> From his new vantage point, Ryoga could see  that there were a full five people in the alley, each of them wearing an  expression of cold amusement on their faces</i>.<i>  Ryoga felt his uneasiness increase</i>.<i>  He knew when he wasn't in much of a  condition to fight well, and being in the midst of a group of people looking  for trouble wasn't a good place to be while in such a condition</i>.<i>  Determined not to let it show, he leveled  what he hoped was an equally cold glare at the man in front of him, who Ryoga  guessed was the leader</i>.</p><p><i>The man smirked, apparently undaunted</i>.<i>  "You're trespassing, little man," he said</i>.<i>  His tone was full of the deceptive levity  one would expect from someone whose intentions are likely to be of the opposite  nature</i>.</p><p><i>"I'm sorry then," Ryoga said, struggling to keep his  voice calm</i>.<i>  Had he been at his  full strength, this entire situation wouldn't be nearly so much of a problem as  it currently was a risk of becoming</i>.<i>  "I didn't see any signs</i>.<i>"</i></p><p><i>This produced a ripple of laughter from the gang members</i>.<i>  "He's got a tongue, don't he Kuma," one  commented</i>.</p><p><i>"That he does," agreed the leader, apparently known as  Kuma</i>. <i> "Especially for someone  who's just been caught in a place where he don't belong</i>.<i>"</i></p><p><i>Ryoga swallowed hard</i>.<i>  "Fine," he managed to say</i>.<i>  "I'll leave</i>.<i>"  He  tried to press himself as close to the wall as he could in order to get past,  but the man shifted forward slightly and extended an arm to block his path</i>.</p><p><i>"I don't think so," he said</i>.<i>  "You're trespassing, remember?  That means you gotta pay the toll</i>.<i>"</i></p><p><i>Ryoga stepped back slightly</i>.<i>  Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the  others moving forward and tightening the semi-circle they had formed around him</i>.<i>  "I don't have any money," he said flatly,  hoping that he didn't look as nervous as he felt</i>.</p><p><i>Kuma slid his hand down the wall until his arm was almost  level with Ryoga's shoulder</i>.<i>   Ryoga risked a glance towards the end of the alley, the path to which  would lay clear if he could just get past this one person</i>.<i>  But he knew that could change in an instant  if he tried to move in that direction, and he wasn't sure he had enough  strength in him to make a break for it</i>.</p><p><i>"Well then," Kuma said, and Ryoga turned back to him</i>.<i>  "Lucky for you, money isn't the only  currency we accept</i>.<i>"</i></p><p><i>Ryoga felt his insides go cold at the man's gaze, which  had long since changed from being amused to something far more aggressive and  almost predatory</i>.<i>  Ryoga stood  staring at him for the brief instant it took for his mind to assimilate an idea  of what such a look might entail</i>.<i>   Then, using some of the precious little energy he had, Ryoga ducked and  slipped beneath his arm</i>.<i>  He'd  barely gotten a step away when a hand grabbed his shoulder and spun him back  around</i>.<i>  Before Ryoga could  react, he felt himself being slammed against the side of the building</i>.<i>  The back of his head hit the bricks hard  enough to make his vision blacken momentarily</i>.<i>  The next thing he knew, he was struck across the face, whether by  a fist or something else he didn't know</i>.<i>  The blow connected soundly with his temple, knocking him to the  ground</i>.<i>  He hit the pavement  before he could get his arms out to stop himself, and his forehead connected  with the unyielding asphalt</i>.<i>   Under normal circumstances, Ryoga would've been fine, but the lack of  food and rest had put him on the verge of collapse already, and this most  recent abuse certainly wasn't improving things</i>.<i>  As he struggled to remain conscious, Ryoga  felt someone grabbing his arm and pulling him upright</i>.<i>  Putting as much force behind it as he could,  Ryoga jerked his other arm backwards, slamming his elbow into whoever was  holding him</i>.</p><p><i>"Bastard!" the person shouted, releasing him abruptly</i>.<i>  Ryoga managed to get one of his legs out  from under him and stood up</i>.<i>  The  others were moving towards him now, keeping him completely surrounded</i>.<i>  One, a tall man with bleached blond hair,  lunged towards him</i>.<i>  It was only  the careless nature of the attack that afforded Ryoga the time to dodge</i>.<i>  He retaliated with a straight punch to the  man's face, but was dismayed to find that even though it connected solidly, it  only sent him staggering backwards instead of flying into the opposite wall</i>.<i>  But Ryoga didn't have much time to reflect  on it before he was grabbed from behind by the largest member of the group, a  greasy looking character who was at least three or four times his size</i>.<i>  Two thick arms wrapped around Ryoga's chest  and lifted him slightly, pinning his own arms to his sides and preventing him  from gaining any purchase with his feet</i>.<i>  Ryoga fought against him wildly for a moment, knowing he couldn't  keep this up for long</i>.<i>  If he  didn't manage to get away soon…</i></p><p><i>A fourth stepped forward, a dark half-grin on his face as  he drew back his fist and threw it forward, striking Ryoga in the abdomen</i>.<i>  A wave of anger ignited within him, allowing  Ryoga to ignore the pain momentarily</i>.<i>   Fueled by little else than bare rage, Ryoga swung his leg up and kicked  his tormenter in the chest</i>.<i>  With  gravity now on his side, Ryoga brought his foot back down and connected his  heel with his captor's knee</i>.<i>  The  man let out a grunt of pain and loosened his grip</i>.<i>  Ryoga tried to pull himself free, but others  were stepping forward now, grabbing him and pushing him back against the larger  man, who was recovering all too quickly</i>.<i>  Instead of trying to hold on to him again, he stepped aside and  helped the bleached blonde shove Ryoga against the wall</i>.<i>  Once there, they each grabbed an arm, both  keeping one hand above his elbow and the other gripping his wrist</i>.<i>  Ryoga tried to twist himself away, but they  were both too strong—or he was too weak</i>.<i>  He felt their legs press against his in order to prevent him from  kicking, effectively trapping all of his limbs</i>.<i>  He could feel the roughness of bricks at his  back, and he knew there was no place for him to go</i>.<i>  The others were quickly regrouping as well;  the one he'd kicked was standing again with the aid of the last, a lanky individual  with dyed blue hair and a silver-studded face</i>.<i>  They stepped forward until Kuma raised a cautioning hand</i>.</p><p><i>"Careful, boys," he said, though he was obviously  entertained by the display</i>.<i>   "This one's got teeth</i>.<i>"</i></p><p><i>"Little prick," hissed the one, his hand moving to rub  his chest</i>.<i>  He glared at Ryoga  with undisguised malice in his narrowed eyes</i>.</p><p><i>"You practically asked for that, Eisuke," said the man on  Ryoga's left, the blonde-haired one</i>.<i>   "You saw he can fight</i>.<i>"</i></p><p><i>" 'Could' fight," the leader corrected him, moving to  stand in front of Ryoga again</i>.<i>   "He's not gonna be doing much of anything, now</i>.<i>"  </i></p><p><i>"Let me go," Ryoga snapped, trying to make his anger  overpower the gnawing fear he was feeling</i>.<i>  He glared up at Kuma, hoping his voice had sounded steadier to  them than it had to him</i>.<i>  But the  man only gave him a chill smile that was followed by more dry laughter from the  others</i>.<i>  Then, without so much as  blinking, he reached out and backhanded Ryoga across the face</i>.</p><p><i>"You're not in much of a position to be making demands,  don't you think?" Kuma said, though to Ryoga, the words sounded hazy and far  away</i>.<i>  He struggled to get a  grasp on his reeling thoughts, to figure out something that would get him out  of this…</i></p><p><i>Ryoga felt a hand brush his cheek, the cool fingertips  lightly tracing his jaw</i>.<i>  The  touch yanked him back to awareness, and he jerked away, nearly striking the  back of his head against the building as he did so</i>.  <i>"Get away from me!" he cried, outraged at  what was happening</i>.<i>  Anger and  indignation rose within him; if only he hadn't been lost for days, he would  never be getting toyed with by a group of street slime like this</i>.<i>  Yet at the same time, Ryoga felt an icy  terror starting to wrap its way around his heart</i>.<i>  He was only a few steps above being  helpless, and he was uncertain if he'd even remain there for much longer</i>.<i>  He was outnumbered and outsized, and though  they weren't martial artists, these people obviously had some fighting  experience</i>.<i>  Pain flared through  him yet again, and it took Ryoga a moment to realize that he'd been slapped a  second time</i>.</p><p><i>"Shut up," Kuma snarled, his eyes steely</i>.<i>  "You've got a big mouth for a little piece  of trash that's strayed out of its can, you know that?"</i></p><p><i>"Go to hell," Ryoga spat, fury overwhelming his sense of  self-preservation</i>.</p><p><i>The man's smile returned slowly, and without taking his  eyes off Ryoga, he reached into his pocket</i>.<i>  There was a flash of silver as the switchblade snapped out of its  metal sheath, its surface gleaming in the dim light</i>.<i>  The sight of it sent another jolt of fear  through Ryoga as Kuma stepped forward and slid a hand under his chin</i>.<i>  Ryoga tried to pull away, but the fingers  tightened their hold, making his jaw ache</i>.</p><p><i>"Listen up, kid," he hissed through the smile</i>.<i>  He leaned in close, causing Ryoga to pull  back reflexively, but it was a futile effort given the man's grip</i>.<i>  The scent of stale cigarette smoke, musty  leather, and the sickly-sweet stench of alcohol surrounded him</i>.<i>  Ryoga fought down a wave of nausea as he  tried not to look at the knife poised inches away from him</i>.</p><p><i>"You're gonna keep your mouth shut and do what I tell  you," Kuma ordered</i>.<i>  "And if you  don't, I'm gonna carve my initials into that pretty face of yours</i>.<i>  Understand?"</i></p><p><i>Ryoga stayed silent, his heart frozen in his chest</i>.<i>  His arms were starting to throb painfully  where the rough hands were pressing into the flesh, reminding him that he had  very few options</i>.<i>  He tried  desperately to think of something, anything, that would help him</i>.<i>  He felt so weak, and his entire body was  flooded with various forms of pain, all of his muscles aching and burning with  tension</i>.<i>  Even a Shi-shi Hokodan  was impossible when he couldn't so much as bring his hands together, not to  mention focus when fear was flooding through him like this…</i></p><p><i>Kuma leaned back slightly, letting go of Ryoga's face</i>.<i>  "That's better," he said</i>.<i>  He slid his hand down and hooked his fingers  on the fabric of Ryoga's shirt, then brought forward the knife</i>.<i>  Ryoga held still for a moment, not entirely  sure of what was going to happen</i>.<i>   He glanced around nervously, taking in the cruel leers stamped upon all  the men's features</i>.<i>  Then he felt  the knife begin to slice through his shirt, leaving no uncertain terms as to  what they planned to do with him</i>.<i>   The cold sharpness of the blade touched his chest, leaving a trail of  pain followed by a thin wake of blood</i>.<i>   The full reality of the situation suddenly became horrifically clear,  loosing a wave of absolute terror through his trembling body</i>.<i>  Utter panic rose in him, sending a rush of  adrenaline through his veins</i>.</p><p><i>"No!" Ryoga gasped, his dark eyes widening</i>.<i>  With a desperate yank, he managed to  untangle one of his legs</i>.<i>  He instantly  brought his knee up with all his might, not caring that it only struck Kuma's  hip instead of his midsection</i>.<i>   It was still enough to send the man staggering a few feet back, giving  Ryoga precious time</i>.<i>  One of the  men holding him leaned forward to steady their flailing leader, momentarily  forgetting to maintain his grip</i>.<i>   Ryoga twisted frantically in an effort to get loose, his desperation  increasing the strength of his movements</i>.<i>  He broke free an instant before the recovered and enraged Kuma  dove at him, knife upraised</i>.<i>   Unable to avoid the attack, Ryoga threw his arm up in a block</i>.<i>  The blade slashed into his forearm, sending  a flare of heated pain through him</i>.<i>   Nonetheless, he managed to raise his leg in a kick, connecting his foot  solidly with the man's shoulder</i>.<i>   More were rushing towards him now, and the man grasping his other arm  turned, swinging his fist</i>.<i>  Ryoga  dropped into a crouch and the intended blow sailed over his head</i>.<i>  He glanced down at the surface of the  street, now bare inches away, and plunged his hand into the pavement</i>.</p><p><i>The asphalt exploded, sending a hail of black in all  directions</i>.<i>  The men jumped  backwards, trying to cover their faces as pieces of rock and hardened tar  rained against them</i>.<i>  Ignoring  the startled shouts and curses of the gang members, Ryoga leapt to his feet and  ran, knowing he had mere seconds before they came after him</i>.<i>  He turned the corner and dashed down the  street, drawing forth every last bit of energy he had, never slowing or even  looking back to see if he was being followed</i>.</p><p><i>Ryoga ran on and on, his breath coming in ragged gasps as  his body fought to keep moving</i>.<i>   Finally unable to go any further, he stumbled and fell to the ground</i>.<i>  His heart was pounding, and his head  throbbed mercilessly as black spots danced before his eyes</i>.<i>  Ryoga fought to slow his labored breathing,  a task made more difficult by the sharp, stabbing pain in his side and the  uncontrollable trembling of his body</i>.<i>   After a few moments, his vision began to clear and some of the pain in  his head receded</i>.<i>  Ryoga slowly  pushed himself to his feet, despite the raging protest of his muscles</i>.<i>  He glanced around at his new surroundings,  and saw that he was in some sort of marketplace, though the streets were  deserted</i>.<i>  It was hardly surprising,  considering the early evening hours were setting in, and the sun was no longer  visible in the sky</i>.</p><p><i>Ryoga swallowed, trying to rid his mouth of the metallic  aftertaste of blood and fear</i>.<i>  He  finally turned to look over his shoulder, and was relieved to see no one was  there</i>.<i>  He glanced at the store  he was standing closest to, noting how the surface of its large front window  mirrored the last violet reds of the sunset</i>.<i>  Ryoga stepped closer and gazed at his reflection in the darkened  glass, taking in the sight of his dusty, tear-streaked face, marred with  darkening bruises, his torn and disheveled clothes, and the bloodied gash on  his forearm</i>.<i>  Then he turned away  and began walking</i>.</p><p><i>Later, when he would find his pack and get back on the  road, he would tell himself it didn't matter how he'd gotten the bruises, or  how his shirt had been ripped, or what the wound on his arm was from</i>.<i>  He would have to fix the clothes, and keep  the cuts clean until they healed</i>.<i>   But that was all</i>.</p><p><i>Anything else simply didn't exist</i>.</p><p>Ryoga shuddered, bringing his awareness to the present  again.  He glanced up at the window,  noting the darkness lying in wait behind the glass.  He thought of what might be lurking in certain spots of that  darkness and shivered again, glad for the first time to be inside Ukyo's house.</p><p>Ryoga hugged his knees to his chest, wishing he hadn't  remembered <i>that</i>.Some  things were best forgotten.</p><p>Like his entire, miserable life.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut, preparing to lower his head into  his arms, but something made him jump nervously.  Ryoga glanced over his shoulder.   There was nothing there, of course, just the wall, same as before.  He sighed inwardly, disliking the vaguely  familiar sense of paranoia stirring in him.   There was no reason for it really, he was here, not lost in the middle  of Osaka or wherever he'd been all that time ago…</p><p>Ryoga paused at the thought.</p><p>All <i>what</i> time ago?</p><p>When…when had that happened?  He pushed a hand through his bangs, his thoughts spinning.  A moment later, he lifted his head,  realization dawning on him.  He glanced  down at his arm, then grabbed the sleeve of his shirt and pulled it back.  In the middle of his forearm was a long,  thin scar; the freshly healed tissue still red and defined, and not possibly  more than two months old.</p><p>Ryoga moaned and covered his eyes with his hands, a wave of  nausea flowing through him.  He didn't  need to look at his chest to see the sister scar that would be there, thinner  and paler since it hadn't been as deep, but it would be there, clear as the one  on his arm.  To know that it had  happened so recently…he had nothing to comfort himself with, nothing that might  let him convince himself it couldn't happen again.  He couldn't tell himself he was older or bigger or stronger,  because he <i>wasn't</i>.  He was still  seventeen, still cursed, still prone to getting lost, and there was nothing to  keep him from ending up lost and hungry and weak in a dark alley prowled by  people who'd like to…</p><p><i>No,</i> Ryoga told himself, slamming the door on that  line of thought.  It hadn't  happened.  It hadn't happened.  Nothing had happened.</p><p>"Nothing happened," he murmured out loud, though to his ears  the voice seemed not his own, and did little to reassure him.  He struggled to put it out of his thoughts,  to keep the door closed.  He'd built  mental walls around this before, he could do it again…</p><p>Except he couldn't.   Not this time.  When it had  happened, he'd been able to detach himself from the whole event enough to  almost deny its existence entirely.  But  how could he detach himself from a memory?   A memory that could only be his?   There was no escaping it now; he simply didn't have the wherewithal to  construct the necessary emotional brickwork yet again.</p><p>Ryoga felt the all-too-familiar sting of tears in his  eyes.  Even distracting himself with  other things was out of the question, for the only distractions were nearly as  bad.  Which was better—thoughts of fresh  hurt and ruined hopes, or memories of fear and past ordeals?  What kind of a choice was that?</p><p>Ryoga trembled slightly and tried to get a hold of  himself.  It was hardly a choice at all,  but what could he do?  Pick an option,  or have one picked for him by his restless subconscious.  There hardly seemed to be a point.</p><p>Unless he made a new option.</p><p>Ryoga lifted his head.   He couldn't control what he remembered, but he could control some of  what he might be distracted by.</p><p>And distance from certain reminders couldn't hurt,  either.</p><p>Night fell slowly, stealing in from beyond the edges of the  horizon and covering over the last of the lingering daylight with shadows.  After the reds and golds of the sunset had  faded away, the sky shifted to increasingly deeper shades of blue, then indigo,  and finally black.</p><p>Within the brightly-lit dojo, Akane paid little attention to  the arrival of night.  She was sitting  on the smooth wood of the floor, dressed in her yellow gi and breathing a  little heavily from the series of katas she'd just been through.  She knew that if she'd been concentrating more  on what she was doing, her breaths would've remained more in time with her  movements and would not have escaped her as it had.  But her mind had been full of thoughts that had nothing to do  with her katas.</p><p>Akane sighed, wondering if Ryoga was doing any better than  Ukyo had said the day before.  She'd  tried calling once she got home from the Cat Café, but Ukyo hadn't picked up  the phone.  Akane had taken it as a sign  that she probably had her hands full.   She'd considered going over to the restaurant this afternoon, or at  least calling again, but something had kept her from doing either.  For one thing, she suspected that Ukyo had  gone easy on her when telling her about Ryoga, particularly after Akane had  found out exactly what the powder had done.   She figured that Ryoga was probably much worse off than she'd  thought—and worse than Ukyo had let on—and Akane was afraid that if she called  or showed up there it would somehow make things worsen even further.</p><p>On top of that, Akane was also feeling troubled over the  conversation she'd had with Ranma on their way home.  He'd been in a touchy mood, which she supposed was somewhat  understandable, especially after she'd started questioning him nonstop on  matters he obviously didn't want to be asked about.  She'd had to know why he hadn't told her about Ryoga's curse, and  she'd hoped Ranma would tell her that Ryoga's past hadn't been such a bad thing  to remember.  But Akane knew she hadn't  really had much right to be asking about other things.  Ranma had made it plain to her on prior  occasions that aside from the bread fight, he had no wish to talk about  anything else that had gone on between Ryoga and himself.  She'd surmised early on that there was more  to it than he'd told her—there were too many things that weren't explained by a  drawn-out scuffle between two little boys over cafeteria food for there not to  be.  She'd even tried asking Ryoga about  it once, but he'd simply said something about there not being much to tell since  she already knew about the bread, and then changed the subject.</p><p>Akane rubbed her eyes.   She supposed it wasn't really any of her business, but it might help her  understand why things had taken the courses they had.</p><p>Like why Ranma had started this entire thing in the first  place.</p><p>That had been puzzling Akane from the start.  What were his motives?  Why had he tricked Ryoga, when there didn't  seem to be much in it for him?  Had  Ranma <i>wanted</i> her to find out about Ryoga's curse?  That didn't seem right, there were a hundred  different ways he could've done that and all of them easier, and besides, he'd  always worked so hard to keep her from finding out that it didn't really make  sense that he'd suddenly change his mind.   Had he been hoping to make Ryoga dislike her or vice versa?  And if that was his aim, then why?  Besides, Dr. Tofu had told them that people  with amnesia usually regained their memories, so Ranma had to know that  couldn't possibly work very well.  Had  he done it just for the sake of tricking Ryoga?  That didn't seem right either—it was true that Ranma seemed to  like teasing Ryoga well enough, even to the point where it bordered being  hurtful, but to do so this way…that bordered real cruelty, and Ranma wasn't  like that.  Not to mention that he  seemed sincerely upset over how things had turned out.</p><p>So what could it possibly be?</p><p>Akane pushed herself to her feet and made her way  outside.  The grass was cool and wet  beneath her feet, and she could see softly rounded dewdrops clinging to the  blades by the light of the moon.  She  glanced over her shoulder at the roof, making sure that Ranma wasn't there—she  knew he'd been spending time up there lately, apparently as a means of avoiding  everyone.  Or maybe he was making it  easier for them to avoid him.</p><p>Akane walked over to the koi pond.  She gazed down at its mirror-like water, and the reflection of  the glittering stars spilling across the night sky above.  A bright leaf drifted down before her to settle  on the surface, sending out a myriad of silvery ripples that made the water-trapped  stars shimmer.  A few moments later, the  pond returned to its former glassy stillness, and she wished things were back  to normal.</p><p>Akane knew it was a vain hope.  Too many things had already changed, and this very moment still  others were shifting like sands in the wind.   Besides that, Akane was beginning to wonder just how good 'normal' had  actually been.  She wasn't so naïve as  to be completely unaware of the things that had been pressing up from beneath  the surface for months and months; the underlying tensions that had repeatedly  been put aside, ignored, or left unaddressed because it seemed easier to just  let things be for the moment.  Now that  some of these were being brought to light, Akane had a feeling that more would  follow.  But maybe it wouldn't be so  bad.  Maybe they could still fix things.</p><p>Akane straightened up again.  Cologne had told them the extent of what the powder had done, and  Ukyo herself had said Ryoga wasn't doing well.   That made helping him the number one priority to Akane, now more than  ever.  But doing nothing wasn't going to  help anything.  And that made Akane  determined to do something.</p><p>Tomorrow, she would go to Ukyo's.  And she would talk to Ryoga.</p><p>No matter what.</p><p>Ukyo scowled slightly as she rummaged through the cabinet  hanging over the bathroom sink, searching for something that might help settle  Ryoga down enough for her to make him eat.   She let out an irritated sigh and slammed the little door shut, unable  to find the sought-after anti-nausea medicine or anything else that might prove  useful, then stalked into the kitchen.</p><p>After whatever had happened to him yesterday, Ryoga had  refused to talk to her much, claiming he was tired.  Ukyo had decided that if he wanted to play that game it was fine  with her, so she'd given him a cup of tea laced with a fair amount of the  valerian extract she kept around in case of insomnia.  Consequently, he hadn't so much as stirred from where she'd put  him on the couch until around noon.   Having successfully made him get some real rest, Ukyo had figured the  next order of business was to get some food in him.  She'd hoped to find something that would help keep it in him—in  the event that she managed to convince him this time around—but after a quick  search of the kitchen drawers, it became apparent that she was fresh out of  little bubblegum-pink tablets that were supposed to do that sort of thing.</p><p>Ukyo clenched her teeth for a moment, trying to keep her  frustration in check.  The last thing  she wanted was to make this mess worse, and she certainly wasn't going to let  that happen as a product of her misplaced annoyance.  Ukyo took a few deep breaths, trying to release her tension with  her exhales.  Then she noticed something  that made her breath catch in her throat.</p><p>Ryoga's pack was missing.</p><p>Ukyo stared at the spot where it had been for a long, tense  moment, trying to think.</p><p><i>I was in the shower, </i>she remembered.  <i>He was asleep again, so I thought it was  Ok</i>.<i>  He must've woken up…damn it,  I left the door half open so I could hear him if he went past or something…</i></p><p>Ukyo tried to still her whirling thoughts.  She was jumping to conclusions; she might've  moved it herself and just forgotten, or maybe Ryoga had wanted something out of  it, all she had to do was go check…</p><p>She turned around and ran down the hallway, turning the  corner into the living room so quickly that she nearly sent herself careening  into the sofa.  Steadying herself, she  glanced down…</p><p>And saw nothing but the discarded blanket on the floor.</p><p>"Damn it," Ukyo murmured.   She bent down and picked it up, feeling tears burn her eyes.</p><p>It was warm.</p><p>Dropping it, Ukyo darted to the window.  Gripping the sill with her hands, she leaned  out and looked up the street, then down.   Several blocks away, she spotted a figure wearing a dark yellow shirt  and carrying a backpack.</p><p>"Ryoga!" Ukyo cried.   The figure halted, and turned.</p><p>He looked up at her, his dark eyes meeting hers for a long  moment.  She opened her mouth, wanting  to tell him to come back, but she was caught up in looking at his face and the  silent expression of anguish written across it.</p><p>Then he turned, rounded the corner, and vanished.</p><p>"No," Ukyo said breathlessly.  "Wait…"</p><p>She would go after him.   Ryoga was sick and hurting and upset and whatever else, she couldn't  just let him wander off…</p><p>She could call Akane and the others.  They would help.  Ukyo went back to kitchen and lifted the phone from its  hook.   He wouldn't be happy about it, but it was for the best…</p><p>Ukyo thought of the look in his eyes.  Sadness.   Betrayal.  Pain.</p><p><i>This isn't going to work, </i>she realized suddenly.  No matter what Akane might've said, or how  Ranma might try to explain, Ryoga wasn't—couldn't—handle it right at this  point.  She understood now, and could  see that he needed not only to sort out what had happened, but everything else  that he'd been through as well.  There  was no way for him to do it other than by himself—anyone he might've considered  looking to for help had broken any trust he might've once had in them, and Ukyo  doubted he would rush to hand his heart back over to those who had mistreated  it so callously.  All of them had known  there was a degree of fragility beneath the surface, and they'd been pushing  the boundaries for a long time, convincing themselves that Ryoga's physical  strength and tough words signified something different than what was really  there.  Now, Ukyo realized, they'd  finally pushed too far, and she knew she'd have to let him go.</p><p>She didn't like the idea of him being on his own for several  reasons, but if getting away from the sources of his hurt was the only thing  that would keep away the breakdown she sensed was threatening, then it was  necessary.  She hung the phone up  absently.</p><p>"Jackass," she murmured, her throat feeling constricted.  "You could've…you at least could've said goodbye…"</p><p>But then, of course, she would've tried to stop him.  Ukyo sighed.  Ryoga had a tendency to make entrances—he was continually  bursting in unexpectedly with some dramatic words or an attack of some  sort.  But over time, she'd come to  realize that his departures were often the opposite—he slipped out or wandered  off, almost always when no one was watching, making few or no waves as he did  so.  Ukyo went over to a window and  looked out at the empty street.  She  wondered how long it would be before she saw another one of his entrances.  A while at least, he wasn't likely to want  to come back any time soon…</p><p><i>I forgot that I hate my life</i>…</p><p>No, Ukyo concluded, Ryoga wouldn't be coming back any time  soon.</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Before anyone says that what happened in the flashback  wouldn't happen to someone like Ryoga, hear me out.  I know he's strong and skilled, and I know he's experienced and can  take care of himself.  But he's also  young, prone to getting lost, and therefore prone to ending up in dangerous  situations.  Even for someone with  remarkable endurance like his, a few days without adequate food, water, and  rest can and will make him very weak and vulnerable.   Given the number of times in the series that Ryoga is attacked or  set upon during his travels, and given the number of times he's shown suffering  from excessive fatigue or even passing out, I really can't say I find what goes  on in the flashback to be unlikely.  Actually,  I think it's probably more likely than not that he would have something like  this happen to him eventually—law of averages, one of the times that he's  attacked is eventually going to coincide with one of the times that he's in bad  shape and unable to defend himself</p><p>properly.</p>
