</div><p>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranma ½. You're gonna have to  use your imagination for a wittier one than that. It gets the job done, anyway.</p><p>Notes: Apologies for the long wait. Things have been  hectic, and I didn't want to post something that I couldn't really put enough  effort into. It's still short, however, gomen!</p><p>Thanks to Archmagesilvento for his continuing help with this  story. It's certainly keeping things interesting...</p><p><b><i>Part Three, Chapter  Three: Grace</i></b></p><p>Mint woke to a pleasant warmth and a great deal of pain.</p><p>He cracked open his eyes to see a blur that he nevertheless  managed to recognize instantly as Herb, and after an additional moment he  identified the warmth as healing energy, the softer manifestation of Herb's  mastery of chi.</p><p>"Herb-sa... sama?" he managed to croak.</p><p>The warmth immediately cut off, and Mint regretted speaking.</p><p>"Good, you're conscious," said Herb in a clipped voice,  turning away.</p><p>Mint groaned and sat up, trying to ignore the spinning in  his head but it was futile. He slumped back down, clenching his eyes closed  against the sudden burst of nausea.</p><p>"Don't try to move," Herb snapped at him, but beneath the  irritation there was a definite note of concern.</p><p>Mint didn't try to move again, but he did turn his head to  one side to watch Herb.</p><p>The dragon had moved to another, very familiar, figure who  Mint could barely see out of the corner of his eye. He nearly gasped when he  saw Lime's condition, and immediately understood why Herb had stopped healing  him.</p><p>He also wondered – what had happened to do all of this? Herb  wasn't in top shape either, Mint saw easily, and it took a lot to dishevel her.  Mint wished that he had fully seen and understood what had happened on that  mountaintop.</p><p>But it had obviously been devastating. Lime was... Mint  wanted to look away from the tiger-boy. He looked like he was almost dead, and  that was the most optimistic description that Mint could think of. A more  descriptive, but more disheartening, one would be that the looked like death  would be the preferable option.</p><p>And then his mind immediately came up with the question, one  that should have logically followed more quickly – <i>how badly was I hurt,  that Herb-sama tended to me first? </i>Mint shuddered, and closed his eyes. Herb  had started to heal Lime, and it seemed like a very good time to take a nap.</p><p>Mint woke up again an indeterminate amount of time later. It  was night, and it must have been a while since his previous awakening. He was  feeling better – and starving. He sat up, pleased that he could stifle the  dizziness that came with movement, and glanced around. Herb was asleep, looking  exhausted; Lime was also asleep. They were alive but looked worse than Mint  felt, and that meant that they were probably unconscious.</p><p>Mint vaguely recognized his surroundings as the same place  he had been upon his first awakening, a clearing in a forest near a rocky  outcropping that provided some protection from the elements. It wasn't quite a  cave, but looked like it could protect them from rain at the very least.</p><p>Mint crawled over to Herb to check on her. She was showing  obvious signs of fatigue, deep lines etched into her face and bags underneath  her eyes that were only beginning to smooth out in sleep.</p><p>Suddenly her eyes snapped open, and bright red eyes with  cat-slit pupils that shone in the moonlight looked at him, confusedly for a  moment, then narrowed, dark and disapproving.</p><p>"Go to sleep, Mint," she ordered in a tone that was  authoritative even through the sleepiness, and Mint instinctually obeyed,  practically throwing himself back onto the soft spot in the ground that had  partially molded itself to the shape of his body.</p><p>"I... I'm sorry, Herb-sama..."</p><p>"Don't be. Just go to sleep, let yourself heal." The voice,  so laden with exhaustion and underlying pain, was unusually soft. Mint hastily  closed his eyes and willed himself to go to sleep, certain that he would never  be able to attain that state again for hours at least.</p><p>Of course, he was asleep less than five minutes later. His  body knew what it needed, even if his mind didn't.</p><p>In the end, it was the sunrise that woke Herb.</p><p>"Go- good morning, Herb-sama!" Mint greeted her haltingly as  she carefully opened her eyes. She was awake, rested, but still feeling drained  from the great expenditure of energy from the day before that had been  necessary to heal herself and her two underlings. She sat up.</p><p>Mint had somehow managed to light a fire and was roasting  three squirrels over it on a spit. He prodded one of the rodents and shook his  head. "If you're hungry, Herb-sama, I am sorry, but breakfast is not quite  finished cooking yet."</p><p>"I thought I told you to rest."</p><p>Mint immediately looked contrite. "I apologize, Herb-sama,"  he said, lowering his head. "But... I was hungry... and squirrels are easy to  catch, so it was really no effort at all!" It was pointless to say that they  had lost all of their possessions, including money, in the blur that was the  destruction of Horaisan. They retained their clothing, but that was about all –  and even it was looking tattered. Herb's armor had survived, and that was the  only item of any real value they had, so it was but a minor worry.</p><p>Herb just shook her head. "Very well."</p><p>"Are you feeling better, Herb-sama?"</p><p>Herb waved a hand negligently in his direction. "As well as  I ever will be, trapped in this body!" she spat, unintentionally bringing up  the real reason for the dark feeling that filled her.</p><p>"You shouldn't be so upset, Herb-sama," Mint said, obviously  trying to consoling but missing wildly. Herb grimaced, torn between the  instinct to slice Mint in half for his obtuseness and the knowledge that it  really wasn't his fault. Then he spoke again.</p><p>"Oh, Herb-sama! I just remembered!" Herb looked up at Mint  curiously. "When I was out hunting," he went on, "I found something that I  thought might interest you!" He reached behind his back and picked up two  shining fragments of metal. Herb's eyes widened.</p><p>Mint mistook the expression in her eyes. He smiled, certain  that this had cheered Herb up, and so it surprised him a great deal when Herb  reached over to him and knocked the two kettle fragments out of his hands,  letting them fall to the ground and roll several feet away. "Herb-sama?" he  asked, confused.</p><p>"Do not show those to me again!" Herb shouted, clearly angry  now. She took a deep breath, tried to calm herself. "The kettle is destroyed  now. It is of no use to collect pieces! Some other cure will have to be found."  She settled back, trying to relax but still obviously agitated. One hand  twitched as if to form an energy attack to disintegrate the pieces of metal,  but nothing appeared. She was still too drained despite her apparent energy.</p><p>"I-I'm sorry, Herb-sama..." Mint apologized with wide eyes.  But he clearly didn't understand.</p><p>"Don't be sorry. Finish what you were doing. I will be  resting." With that clipped statement, Herb closed her eyes and turned away,  but the tenseness in her shoulders didn't diminish.</p><p>Mint blinked, confused.</p><p>The next time Herb awoke, Lime was awake as well and it was  considerably later in the day, nearly evening. They noticed her very quickly –  they had been casting nervous glances in her direction every minute for several  hours now. Neither of them had dared to touch her. The thought of her wrath if  they did was daunting, and besides, their fingers twitched nervously at the  thought of touching a woman's body far too much to do more than wake and annoy  her.</p><p>Herb was silent. She ate a roast squirrel, her pride  obviously taking a blow for it, and stood, announcing that they were leaving.  This was all within half an hour of waking.</p><p>"Where are we going, Herb-sama?" Lime asked.</p><p>Herb didn't answer. "We are leaving this area."</p><p>They jumped to their feet. If Herb didn't want to say,  pushing the matter could be dangerous. But before he followed Herb, Mint  paused, and picked up the two pieces of metal that still lay on the ground.  Maybe they would prove useful in the future.</p><p>***<p>"What's the matter with Herb-sama?" Lime asked Mint in a whisper as they  trailed a safe distance behind.</p><p>"She seems grumpy," Mint answered. "I think it's a... a  female problem." He spoke the last two words so quietly that even he barely  heard them, and he still turned slightly pink.</p><p>"Oh..." Lime reddened, and nervously twitched his thumbs  together. He changed the subject abruptly, speaking in a much louder voice as  if to cover up the previous embarrassment. "Are those two still alive?" a hint  of anger was showing in his voice now.</p><p>Mint shrugged. "I don't know..." He brightened suddenly, hit  with a rare idea. "Ah! Maybe Herb-sama is tracking them down! I haven't smelled  them here, so they much be elsewhere!"</p><p>Lime nodded, slowly. "If they're not dead... they'll wish  they were."</p><p>Mint nodded as well. "Agreed." He grinned toothily.</p><p>Herb rolled her eyes and tried to ignore the attempts at  holding whispered conversation behind her. <i>When will those two figure it  out!</i> Quite possibly the most aggravating part of being stuck as female was  the inability of Mint and Lime to get it through their skulls that she hadn't  been <i>born</i> that way.<br/>The irritation towards those two was easily diverted towards another pair,  however. Her fingers curled into talons at the thought of... <i>those</i> two.  She refused to think their names. She only knew the names incidentally, anyway.</p><p>However - destination was uncertain, at the moment. To  continue onward, looking for another cure, or to search for the two humans, to  either find proof of their death or exact revenge? Herb didn't like the word,  but if ever a situation merited it, this one did.</p><p>A faint memory of a half-whispered phrase suddenly sounded  in her ears and Herb nearly stumbled to a halt, stunned.</p><p><i>"There is another cure... but I think you would rather  have the kettle."</i> Those weren't the precise  words, Herb knew. But it was the meaning.</p><i>That old witch! She said she knew of something else... but why did she say  that I would rather use the kettle? Perhaps this other one is more difficult to  find, or guarded by fearsome enemies. But I fear nothing, and I will defeat all  enemies in my path! She should have told me! </i>She  began to walk faster, then run. She wished for the energy to fly, but even running  was a strain. A necessary one – undoubtedly the other two would soon be after  the same prize, and there was no point in hoping for their deaths now. Another  confrontation that might result in the destruction of the other cure as well  would be highly undesirable.<p>Mint and Lime were startled by the sudden increase in pace,  and fell behind for a moment. Herb had vanished, and the rustling noise of her  movement was getting more distant rapidly.</p><p>"Herb-sama! Wait up!"</p><p>Herb heard them and almost didn't let them catch up, but  after a few moments she slowed. They came bursting out of the foliage around her  and very nearly bolted past, but managed to stop before losing her again.</p><p>"Herb-sama!" Mint protested between deep breaths. Normally  he could run for hours at a much faster pace, but a combination of injury and  surprise had winded him much faster than normal.</p><p>"Why did you start running, Herb-sama? Where are we going?"</p><p>"Nerima," she answered them curtly.</p><p>"That town...?" Mint looked confused.</p><p>"That town," she confirmed curtly. "I advise that you keep  up, this time." She gave them another moment to catch their breaths, then  started walking again, not quite running but certainly moving at a good clip. A  moment later, Mint and Lime were following her at a short distance, looking  mildly bewildered but resigned to never quite knowing what precisely was in  their master's head.</p><p>Herb ignored them entirely. She had brought them along for  assistance, but at the moment they were useless. She wouldn't abandon them, of  course, but there was no point in explaining anything either. Besides, her mind  was preoccupied with other thoughts.</p><p><i>The kettle may be destroyed, but there's still a cure out  there somewhere! And if that old Amazon won't let me have it... I'll take it!</i></p><p>***<p>~Mordain</p><p>Translation: Herb-sama – Master Herb. I felt that the –sama just  felt more natural, particularly since they use it so much...</p><p>AN: Sorry, but I had to cut away from Ranma and Ryouga for a  little while at least. We'll get back to them, don't worry... anyway, thanks  for reading. I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Please review, and ja ne!</p><p>PS: Great thanks to all the people who reviewed,  particularly those who somehow found the fic recently, even though I've been  very slow about updates. You guys really helped inspire me to finish this  chapter, which has been sitting on my hard drive unfinished for months now...  now to decide which version of "Of Alternate Realities..." 12 is the one I'm  going to use, or to see if I can wrest another chapter from this one this week...</p>
