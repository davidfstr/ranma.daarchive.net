</div><p>Disclaimer: I don't own, or claim to own, Ranma ½ or  any part of it. This fanfic is mine but it's not very much, really.</p><p>Notes: Keeping them short: a) I'm slow, b) this  chapter immediately follows the one previous so reread it if you're confused, and  c) as always, many thanks to archmagesilvento. I should give him co-author  credit or something.</p><p><b><i>Part Three, Chapter  Five: Disconsolation</i></b></p><p>Akane groaned. She followed Ryouga by only a moment and only  because of her brief astonishment over their appearance – both the fact that  they were there at all and their physical look. Jeans and somewhat ragged  sweaters didn't quite suit them.</p><p>She could almost feel Herb, behind her, growl in anger. A  second later the Musk emperor did growl, much to no one's surprise. Ryouga just  rolled her eyes, looking pained and exasperated more than angry. Akane wondered  if between them was the best place to be standing at the moment, and decided  probably at the same time she also decided she didn't care in the slightest.</p><p>"No fighting!" she barked, holding up her hands. Ranma was  more likely to fight than Ryouga, who seemed mildly embarrassed, unless the red  tinge to her cheeks was a cold. Akane delayed her confusion for the time being.</p><p>Unfortunately she had little if any effect on the three who  were most likely to actually start violence, but luckily enough Herb chose to  simply make a noise of irritation and dislike rather than a movement of  aggression.</p><p>Akane dropped her arms, wondering what crazy thought process  had prompted her to attempt to keep the peace, but there wasn't much time to  think.</p><p>"What are you doing here?" Contrary to his bland expression,  the antagonism in Ranma's voice was obvious. He narrowed his eyes, ever so  slightly but enough to punctuate his words.</p><p>"What are you doing alive?" Herb retorted, a smirk as  audible in her words as any emotion that Ranma's contained. She yanked back her  hood almost violently and glared at them, as if the implication she could put  in her voice wasn't enough. Somehow the soft feminine features that were  revealed this way startled Akane.</p><p>"That's our business."</p><p>"Same to any question of yours," Herb answered, and that  seemed to be end of it. For her at least.</p><p>"I, on the other hand, would disagree."</p><p>Everyone turned to look at Cologne who no one had expected  to speak. She generally didn't get involved in things that she didn't have to.</p><p>"What do you mean, ghoul?" Surprisingly enough it was Ryouga  who spoke, and bitingly too.</p><p>The Amazon ignored her. "I think there is more business to  discuss. Perhaps something that both of you, as well as myself, might find  interesting. We'll start with a certain object you carry, son-in-law."</p><p>Ranma and Ryouga had stepped fully into the restaurant by now,  and the door slid closed behind them with a remarkably final snap. Akane rolled  her eyes, wishing for a knife to cut the tension.</p><p>"What object?" If Ranma hadn't been one of the worst liars  in Japan he might have gotten away with it; as it was there was just a touch of  defensiveness in his voice, something in the tone of the two seemingly simple  words that made it quite clear that he knew exactly what was being referred to,  and also betrayed surprise at the mention.</p><p>"Stupidity does not become you. The fragments. Bring them  out."</p><p>Slowly and rebelliously Ranma reached into a bag he carried  at his side and pulled something out, something that gleamed in the light. He  placed it gently on a table – not the one that Cologne was standing on but  rather one with a more defensible position.</p><p>Akane almost didn't notice Ryouga's pained look and her  speed in turning her eyes away from the shining fragments of metal that landed  on the table with a heavy sound that heralded nothing but more complicated  situations ahead.</p><p>Akane couldn't know for certain but was reasonably sure of  what they were, and she inhaled sharply at what they implied. Ryouga's current  femininity hadn't quite registered, but now it did, and painfully too.</p><p><i>So they failed.</i></p><p>The pieces that Ranma produced were clearly from a teakettle  that had been ripped apart by some unknown force.</p><p>Herb's exclamation of shock was not lost, either, but what  was more interesting was not hers but rather the reaction of the two boys who  always flanked her – in particular the shorter one. Cologne gave him a stern  look and with a highly embarrassed and fearful lowering of eyes he pulled  something out of his own pocket. They landed on a table with a second, echoing  series of thunks.</p><p>"Mint!" Herb's voice was angry, not as angry as her words to  Ranma had been but the margin wasn't very large at all.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Herb-sama… but…"</p><p>Cologne was ignoring the both of them and inspecting the  pieces. "Actually, it is very fortunate that he saved them," she commented,  prompting every head in the room to swivel in her direction with  whiplash-inducing speed.</p><p>Akane was interested in the goings-on but there were other,  less blatant things happening at the same time. She edged away from the middle of  the room, past Ranma who was almost oblivious to her presence at this point,  and next to Ryouga who seemed ready to crumple on the floor and launch a  Shishihoukodan or worse.</p><p>Akane placed one hand on the pink-haired girl's shoulder,  eliciting an almost violent jerk in reaction and a startled glance.</p><p>Ryouga looked absolutely dejected, and this was almost  making it worse. Why, Akane didn't know and didn't bother to wonder. She smiled  as comfortingly as she could and patted Ryouga's shoulder consolingly. It  seemed to do some good. They turned their attention back to what was going on.</p><p>"The magic is still intact," said Cologne, seeing that all  eyes were on her.</p><p>Ryouga's visible wince to that was relatively mild, but  Akane's hand was still on her shoulder and felt the shuddering that wasn't  obvious, the tightening of muscles there and all along her back, as violent a  reaction as any outburst.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Herb, Ryouga, and Ranma shouted in  various tones at roughly the same time after a moment's astonished silence.  They exchanged angry glances at each other. Angry, and in two cases, uncertain.  Almost scared, but that was impossible. Ranma was never scared, and rarely  uncertain. Akane dropped her hand back to her side and took a step away.  Violence now would not be stopped by her words, although she felt angry just  thinking about it.</p><p>Cologne rapped her cane noisily on the table, thinking. "Of  course, the magic is useless with the kettle in so many pieces, and no normal  method will suffice to repair it," she finished, managing to look thoughtful  and shrewd at the same time.</p><p>Ryouga reacted strangely to that. Akane couldn't analyze it  exactly.</p><p>"No *normal* means?" Herb pressed.</p><p>"Or any magical means that I can think of… wait." Cologne  caught herself. "There might be one," she corrected.</p><p>"One?" That was Ranma. He glanced back at Ryouga, clearly  excited but the emotion was not reflected in her eyes. His eyes dimmed slightly  at seeing that, but then he turned back to Cologne. "Where? How?"</p><p>Cologne held up one hand to forestall more questions. "I  don't know all of the details," she said. "I will do some research on the  question, however."</p><p>Ranma grinned but not as wide as might be expected. Akane  was baffled again, at both of them.</p><p><i>Something's happened,</i> she thought with certainty.  Certainty about a fuzzy and obvious statement, but it was something to grasp  hold of.</p><p>Ryouga looked away from everyone, choosing to stare at the  wall instead.</p><p>"Why are you helping us like this?" Ryouga's voice was  almost impossibly soft as she asked the question that no one else had thought  of.</p><p>Cologne looked the pink haired girl squarely in the eyes,  expression set hard into something that Akane recognized but couldn't precisely  identify. It seemed out of context, somehow. "I thought you would know." Pause,  dripping with overdone significance. "My interest in magical artifacts, of  course. Both of you previously agreed to let me have the Kaisufuu if you  succeeded. I assume that deal still holds. And if the Kaisufuu can be repaired  not only will be a valuable possession but the method of repair will assist  understanding of such things greatly."</p><p>It was the most obvious smoothly uttered half-truth that had  ever been said. Akane wished she knew what the other half was.</p><p>Herb  sat cross-legged on the floor, head down and expression serious in a violent  sort of way. She was here grudgingly, but Cologne's suggestion hadn't really  been debatable, and the promise of some miraculous restoration of a cure was  too tempting to pass up. Akane had nearly forgotten all the details in the  recent confusion, but from Ryouga's telling of the tale of how all this started  – had it really been almost a month ago? – she remembered that Herb was cursed  in much the same way as Ryouga himself.</p><p>The situation that Cologne had almost casually suggested was  a ridiculous one from any perspective except, apparently, Cologne's, and was  the reason that Herb currently sat on the floor of the Tendo house, clearly  disgruntled. Mint and Lime were nearby but out of immediate line of sight, and  Ranma and Ryouga had retreated to another portion of the house, probably their  respective rooms, to get as far apart from the newcomers as possible. And get  some rest, no doubt. They had looked exhausted earlier. Akane was glad that they  weren't currently there or this would be that much harder. She sighed, rubbing  her eyes. Ranma always had to make things more difficult, didn't he? Ryouga  too, this time at least, she admitted somewhat grudgingly.</p><p><i>Oh well. Not much to be done about it. Besides, what's  *another* freeloader at this point? Okay, three, but at least they have *some*  way of paying…</i></p><p>Monetary compensation would only be minimal, but it was  better than what the Saotomes offered. However, Akane's interest wasn't with  financial matters; that was Nabiki's realm, and the bargaining had indeed been  rather impressive.</p><p>Akane let her sister take care of that sort of thing. But  that wasn't enough, in the youngest sister's book.</p><p>"You're not paying enough to properly compensate for room  and board, you know," she said.</p><p>"I know," Herb answered irritably. "I thought the agreement  had been worked out to your satisfaction."</p><p>"Oh, it has," Akane answered. "I just wanted to set a time.  Tomorrow, I assume, is good?"</p><p>Herb nodded curtly.</p><p>"Alright then. I have class, and I get home around three in  the afternoon." She paused. "Around three-thirty, then."</p><p>"I already agreed to this."</p><p>"But reluctantly," Akane reminded her. "I'm just making  certain."</p><p>Herb stood in an impressive swirl of brown robe and long blue  hair that was clearly calculated to make Akane shut up. It only worked for a  moment, but that was sufficient.</p><p>"I don't break my word," Herb told her lowly. "The time  doesn't matter – you'll get your lesson. Even if it's a waste of my time."</p><p>Akane took a step back, if only because the distance between  them was far too reduced now. "I don't think it is. But okay," she nodded, and  left quickly.</p><p><i>I said too much,</i> she thought with a small smile that  she wasn't quite aware of.</p><p>Ryouga leaned against a wall, fiddling with the three  fragments of kettle that were their find. Two of them fit together almost  perfectly, she had discovered, whereas the third, the spout, required another  piece to attach to. Another piece that Herb was in possession of. Ryouga narrowed  her eyes at the shining bits of metal. Frustrating.</p><p>She brushed a too-long fringe of pink hair off her forehead  and to one side, folding a particularly long tendril behind one ear. She wasn't  quite aware of doing that, nor was she aware of the pair of eyes that rested on  her, narrowed as well but in slight worry rather than frustration, on anything  other than an abstract level.</p><p>After about half an hour of twisting around bits of metal,  meshing the parts that fit together and pulling them back apart with a  single-mindedness that bordered on obsession, she finally put them down. Her  arms hurt, in a strange way that reminded her that she was supposed to be  exhausted.</p><p>"Finally, and you didn't even break them," Ranma commented  nonchalantly. Worry alleviated for now, he fell backwards onto his futon  mattress and stared at the ceiling, feeling tiredness pulling at his eyelids.</p><p>"Shut up, Saotome," Ryouga tried. It came out weak and  tired, however – she was slightly surprised.</p><p>"Do you think her plan is gonna work?"</p><p>"Of course it is, idiot," Ryouga snapped back, crumpling to  the floor. It would be more comfortable to go to her own room where a futon  waited rather than the floor of Ranma's, but that would require standing and  she didn't feel like moving. Odd. Her legs had never hurt like this from mere  walking before.</p><p>"Okay then. Moron." There was a long pause, interrupted only  by faint rustling sounds. Ranma getting comfortable for bed. "I'm goin' to  sleep." Ryouga's only answer was the even breathing of sleep or something like  it.</p><p>"Lettin' me off the hook for once? I shouldn't complain." It  was such a faint whisper that it shouldn't have been audible.</p><p>~Mordain<br/>AN: More Akane-centricness – mostly. I figured that I should pay some attention  to my main characters too during a kinda key point for them in plot… And yes  I'm going somewhere with all this, promise. And please review ^_^. They keep me  inspired to write, as silly as it is to say that, they really do…</p>
