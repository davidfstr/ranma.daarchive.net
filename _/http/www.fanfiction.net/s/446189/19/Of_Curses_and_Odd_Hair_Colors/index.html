</div><p>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranma ½ or any of the  characters and settings contained within this work of fanfiction. Rumiko  Takahashi owns 'em, and Viz owns the manga and anime. Mine is manga based, so I  give the larger portion of credit to Ms. Takahashi.</p><p>Notes: Er, none really. Sorry for keeping the focus  off of Ranma and Ryouga for so long, but since no one seems to mind this too  much, I guess it's okay ^_^.</p><p>Part Three, Chapter Four – Pride</p><p>Akane felt like pacing. Or screaming. Or something. The  patients that had been found in the wreckage of Horaisan were gone. The news  didn't say anything more than that – in fact it didn't even say that. It simply  said that they weren't being held at the hospital anymore. The implication was  that they had been discharged, but no one had yet gone to pick them up and  Akane doubted that the hospital would just let them wander away.</p><p>She was aggravated. <i>How like Ranma to just wander away  without telling anyone! Baka! Bakabakabaka… Ryouga better not be hurt! </i>She  was mildly surprised to find herself worried about the pink-haired girl, but it  was easily explained by the fact that the news programs had mentioned that it  was the girl who was in more serious condition. They had said very little about  the two patients at all, however.</p><p>If she weren't so certain that the two were headed home, she  would have run out there herself and found them. And likely throttled one of  them into orbit.</p><p>Or at least that what she wanted to do. Akane sagged,  slumping down in her chair like a rag doll – or someone who was very, very  tired. She would never admit it when they got back, but she was worried about  them. At least they were alive. She tried to console herself with that. But  there was something else that worried her, something that she couldn't put a  finger on.</p><p>Akane shook her head and headed upstairs. She was tired. Not  much had happened, but it had been an exhausting two days…</p><p>***<br/>In the morning, when she opened her eyes to stare blankly at the ceiling for  several minutes, Akane didn't feel much better than she had the night before. <i>What  happened to sleep easing the worries of the night before, </i>she griped  mentally before pulling herself out of bed, staring blankly in the mirror for  several minutes, and finally dressing for class. She ran out of the house  without breakfast, not really wanting to deal with her family right now.</p><p>The walk to class was a blur, done mostly by simple reflex.  She stared at her feet. If she didn't look up there was no way of knowing that  there wasn't another person following the same path…</p><p>"Akane?"</p><p>She looked up sharply. A female voice saying her name…</p><p>Akane deflated slightly when the image of a familiar girl  with a ponytail of light brown hair came into focus. "Good morning…" she  greeted absentmindedly. She had reached the school without really realizing it.</p><p>Yuka raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong with you?"</p><p>Akane shook her head firmly and pulled her attention fully  into the conversation. <i>Snap out of it… </i>she chastised herself before  answering. "Nothing."</p><p>Her friend didn't look convinced. "Right…"</p><p>The issue wasn't pushed, much to Akane's relief.</p><p>For all of ten seconds. Akane winced.</p><p>"Do you expect me to believe that?" Yuka exploded, as if the  words had been a bomb with a very short fuse. "You've been out of it for days.  Worried?"</p><p>"No," Akane insisted, tightening her grip on the handle of  her bookbag even as she forced her facial muscles into relaxation and smiled.  "What would I be worried about?" He gaze slipped off the face of her friend and  towards the gate of the school, where students swarmed in. She stared blankly  for a moment.</p><p>A figure, not much taller than the stream of students but  very easily differentiable from them, walked with a purposeful stride along the  street on the other side of the entrance to the school. It looked definitively  familiar.</p><p>Akane blinked. "Who…?"</p><p>Yuka, not sure if she was the one being addressed, turned  and looked, but she was a second too late. There was nothing to see other than  the vaguely familiar faces of her classmates as they flowed past. She  scrutinized the crowd for specific faces, but it was sadly easy to tell, since  every figure was draped in one of two outfits of similar coloring. "Is he  back?"</p><p>Akane ignored her friend's question. She started to run for  the gate, but turned around and tossed her bookbag at Yuka, who caught it,  surprised.</p><p>"I'll be back later! There's something I have to take care  of, first!" She hiked up the sleeves of her uniform in obvious preparation for  running. This just befuddled Yuka more.</p><p>Before she could try to ask again, Akane was out of the  gates and gone. The black-haired girl looked at the bag in confusion for a  moment before turning to go to class. No point in being late herself, and she  needed to let others know what had happened…</p><p>***<br/>Akane pumped her arms faster. The streets were crowded at this time of the  morning, making it impossible to search for anyone, so Akane ran rather than  searched, following the most likely path.</p><p>She skidded to a halt in front of a very familiar  restaurant. It wasn't open this early in the morning, but there were definite  signs of activity inside, and several voices were audible even though no words  were discernable over the noise of the street. She hesitated before opening the  door. It might not be any of her concern… but… if that person was back…</p><p>She swung open the door and stepped boldly inside, face set.</p><p>Only to narrowly avoid getting nailed in the forehead by a  porcelain bowl. The dish shattered against the door, and Akane sighed in  relief, thankful for her good reflexes. Then she was drawn back to reality by  the pressure of sudden attention.</p><p>The six people in the restaurant stared at her. Well, one  set of eyes stared at a tall potted plant to her left, but it was the thought  that counted and since Mousse's glasses were perched on top of his head instead  of over his eyes he probably thought it was her, at least…</p><p>It was like a strange, distorted déjà-vu. She wondered if  she ought to have caught the bowl. After all, she would've been severely  annoyed at Ranma if he hadn't caught her when she was the object being tossed  about in the Nekohanten like an unwanted sack of potatoes… or dish.</p><p>The cloaked figure made a noise of irritation. That was  easily the most bothersome of the gazes leveled at her.</p><p>"What are you doing here?" she asked, remembering her  original purpose. The cloak may be concealing, but it was also very conspicuous  when worn on the streets of Tokyo in bright hours of early morning.</p><p>The shortest figure, perched on a table that had been swept  clean, rapped the butt of her cane on the table. "We're closed," Cologne  informed her imperiously. "Please leave." There was little that was polite  about the statement other than it's phrasing.</p><p>"I don't want food." Akane steadied her own gaze at the  hooded figure, narrowing her eyes. "You're back. I want to know what happened."</p><p>For a moment there was no answer. "I have nothing to say to  you, other than that I hope the two you are looking for are dead."</p><p>"You bastard…" Akane tightened her hand into a fist at her  side. She cleared her throat. The words hadn't been audible. "They're not."</p><p>Now she was regarded with more interest. The cloaked figure  leaned back, slightly but significantly, greatly lessening the intimidation factor  of her posture. "They aren't?"</p><p>Akane shook her head firmly. "No. It's all over the news. No  names were given but they're alive, I'm sure of it."</p><p>The two boys who flanked the taller, cowled figure glanced  at each other. The taller of the pair grinned, pleased in a fearsome way with  the news. Akane recognized him as the one who had kidnapped her initially and  suppressed the urge to yell at him, or attack him, or something even less wise.</p><p>Shampoo, behind Cologne, looked pleased. Mousse looked  distinctly irritated, but Shampoo smacked him over the head for some unknown  reason, startling him out of it. The duck-boy's glasses flew off of his head  and clattered on the ground. He immediately dropped to the floor, groping about  blindly to search for them.</p><p>Cologne snorted. "Of course they are alive. Something like  that would not kill son-in-law. But…" The diminutive Amazon matriarch thought  for a moment. "Are you certain that there are two survivors?"</p><p>Akane, slightly confused, nodded.</p><p>"Perhaps the other is not the girl…" Cologne mused. "But  that matters little." She waved the question off and turned back to the other  visitors.</p><p>The cowled figure's opinion on the matter was impossible to  determine. Akane got the impression of a scowl, somehow. "They are worthy opponents,"  she admitted, grudgingly, in a rumbling voice. It was impossible to determine  the gender of the person, but Akane remembered it being identified as female  earlier and relied on that assessment.</p><p>"I do not have what you want," Cologne informed her. It  sounded as if she were repeating the statement, and with a distinct air of  irritation, too.</p><p>The hooded woman – Herb, Akane suddenly recalled the name -  turned back towards the Amazon trio. "You tricked me, old woman, and I won't  forget that. But…" she shook her head. "I will search on my own, then."</p><p>The two boys who resembled a tiger and a wolf glanced at  each other. They seemed to want to say something, but followed their leader as  she started to leave.</p><p>"Wait!" Akane stepped in front of them before they reached  the door and spread out her arms, stopping them. "What happened?"</p><p>Herb looked down at her. Some light made it inside the hood,  faintly outlining some facial features for the first time. The expression  revealed was very, very angry. Akane took an involuntary step back.</p><p>"They destroyed the cure, then destroyed the mountain in an  attempt to defeat me," Herb summarized before pushing past Akane and stepping  up to the door.</p><p>The door opened – but no one stepped outside.</p><p>"Now that was a pretty shitty way of putting it," complained  Ranma, crossing his arms over his chest. Ryouga, behind him, slapped a hand  over her forehead and groaned.</p><p>***<br/>~Mordain</p><p>AN: Short chapter… and such a long wait for it, too. Not the  worst I've ever done… there would be an additional 1,036 words if I thought  that the conversation I had written between Ranma and Ryouga on the walk back  to Nerima was worth including… but it's not. Anyway, please review! I'd like to  know who's still reading this ^^;; thank you for putting up with me, everyone  who's reading!</p><p>PS: Alternate title for this chapter that I decided was just  too stupid and didn't fit my theme: 'The Return of the Travelers' (I'm such a  geek). Yeah, I've actually got a theme for my titles, although most of them  probably don't make any sense to anyone but me.</p>
