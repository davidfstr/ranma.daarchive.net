</div><p>Disclaimer: Neither Ranma ½, its characters, nor its  setting are mine. But this story is my intellectual property. I thought of this  particular string of occurrences, I put the words in this order, and please do  not take them and claim them as your own.</p><p>Note: Considerable OOCness in this part.</p><p>Kir: There wasn't in the first?</p><p>Shut up, Kir-<i>chan</i>…</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>Chapter Two: An Interlude Before The Potato Soup – Er,  I Mean Plot - Thickens</i></b></p><p>Ryouga felt odd living with the Tendo and Saotome  families. No one seemed to be upset about her presence, which was a relief but  distinctly surprising, considering her previous reputation with the two  families. But even Ranma didn't seem to mind her, and Ryouga couldn't manage to  really believe that his old nemesis was actually being sinister and cruel in  some devious way. The hatred that he had held for the pig-tailed boy – which  had been fading anyway - had dwindled down to only glowing embers of faint  jealousy. At least in Ranma's case, the curse was temporary… he had all the  perks of being able to be a girl without most of the downsides. Ryouga gritted  her teeth at the thought of a few of those downsides. She didn't relish the  thought of any of her new hosts finding out about… exactly how totally female  this damn body was. She closed her eyes, trying to shut out the anger. It  wouldn't do to have someone asking why she was so perturbed. It would be too  horrifyingly embarrassing, trying to either answer or evade the questions.</p><p><i>Calm. Calm down, Ryouga. You're a guest. </i>As  unfamiliar as she was to the practice of hiding anger, the completely different  nature of this anger made it a requirement. Sighing and wondering briefly if  staying was really the best course of action, she stood and dressed. It was the  second day after she had arrived, she thought, although her sense of that time  was fuzzy. She vaguely remembered being fussed over by Kasumi and – her cheeks  reddened at the thought – Akane, who was understandably upset.</p><p>Her stomach growled loudly, reminding her forcefully that  her memories did not include having eaten more than some miso soup. She changed  out of the (clean and whole) pajamas she was wearing as quickly as she could,  trying to avoid looking in the old full-length mirror that was leaned up  against the large pile of boxes that showed the room's history as storage  space. She'd gotten over the nosebleeding habit out of necessity, but that  didn't mean that she was going to gape at herself.</p><p>After she was fully dressed, however, she dared a look.  Kasumi had apparently been serious about altering her old clothes, she  realized, because they were what she had, unknowingly in her rush not to look,  put on. They had been adjusted so drastically that she hardly recognized them,  cut down to fit her new body far too well, she thought. It even looked vaguely  feminine, something that made Ryouga distinctly uncomfortable, but at least  they fit. She dared to examine herself more closely, to the point of combing  her tangled mess of pink – really, the Jusenkyou ponds had a sick sense of  humor - hair into something approaching its old style. It was considerably longer  than she last remembered, but she wasn't surprised at that. It was limper than  before, and the bangs hung down her face past her nose, obscuring her vision. A  search for a bandanna came up futile, so she eventually gave up and split it  down the middle to hang unevenly on either side of her face. The result,  combined with - well, everything else – made her look uncomfortably feminine.</p><p><i>It wouldn't be so bad if the shirt wasn't still so long  and the pants cut down so much that it looks like I'm wearing a damn mini-dress  with black leggings. </i>Turning suddenly away from the mirror, she opened the  door and went downstairs quickly, preferring to deal with anyone but her  current self.</p><p>The five residents of the house were at the table, eating  a meal that Ryouga guessed to be dinner, judging by the time. It was a  remarkably typical scene. Ranma and his father were fighting over some tidbit  of food that one had stolen from the other; no matter which one, even the  combatants probably didn't remember. Akane was shouting at Ranma – to no  noticeable effect – to stop being such a jerk; he had just knocked over her tea  but hadn't even noticed. Nabiki was taking the opportunity of the fight to pile  more on her plate, including the bit being fought over. Soun was reading the  newspaper, a slight tic in one eye the only indication that he was aware of the  outside world at all. Ryouga took a brief moment to thank Kami-sama that  Happosai wasn't there. That was the last thing she needed. She knew that she  had a figure approaching, if not exceeding, Ranma-chan's in its… proportions.  She didn't need a reminder.</p><p>Then she felt the single pair of eyes that had noticed her  arrival. Kasumi smiled. "Why, hello Ryouga-chan. Did you sleep well?" she  asked, smiling.</p><p>Some – not all – of the action at the table stopped when  some of the others heard. Akane blinked, putting the mallet back wherever it  came from, smiled in her direction – the expression was obviously somewhat  forced – and greeted, "Konbanwa, Ryouga."</p><p>Ranma stopped his food battle. "Hi, Ryou – hey!" he  interrupted himself. "That's mine! Nabiki!" he accused, meanwhile defending his  plate from Genma's opportunistic attack.</p><p>The middle Tendo daughter just smirked at him. "Konbanwa,"  she greeted absently.</p><p>Suddenly Ryouga noticed that the place at the foot of the  table had somehow been cleared for him, and a plate of food deposited there by  the ever-thoughtful eldest daughter.</p><p>Ryouga decided to ignore the chaos. "Yes, thank you,  Kasumi," she said, bowing, before sitting down and digging in.</p><p>The food tasted delicious, and she ate ravenously at  first, but when it actually got to her stomach it felt as if she had eaten  lead. She slowed, and then finally stopped eating. She felt slightly ill, and  the appetizing meal in front of her suddenly made her want to gag.</p><p>Akane noticed Ryouga suddenly stop eating and had a flash  of worry. She, along with everyone else, had been surprised to see Ryouga come  down to eat, acting so normal and seemingly healthy; she certainly wasn't  acting like someone who had barely been out of bed for three days. <i>I've been  avoiding her, </i>she realized guiltily. <i>But what am I supposed to say? 'I'm  sorry, Ryouga, but I don't love you too?' Somehow I doubt the direct approach  would work. Then there's the girl thing… </i>She shook her head angrily at that  thought. <i>No, that has nothing to do with it. *He* loves… loved? me… I can't  believe that I didn't realize it before. He was always so nervous around me… always  brought me souvenirs from his travels… I felt so stupid when Ranma told me that  it had been obvious to everyone but me that the poor boy had fallen for me  practically when he first laid eyes on me. Thinking about it, Ranma seemed a  little odd when he said that… he seemed almost angry at Ryouga, but I'm pretty  sure it wasn't jealousy – I hope it wasn't! I wonder what it could've been… </i>her  thoughts trailed off unto various tangents before she finally snapped them back  to the problem at hand. <i>Geez… thinking about this isn't helping. I've got to  do something… </i></p><p>All of this pondering occupied a timeframe of only about  two seconds. It was mostly just a reiteration of what had been going through  her mind for the past three days. Determined to say something but lacking  words, she just blurted out the first thing that came to mind. "How are you  feeling, Ryouga?" she asked, trying her best to seem simply concerned.</p><p>Ryouga was caught unprepared. "Huh?" She had been avoiding  eye contact, or any sort of contact for that matter, by intently tracing the  simple pattern that circled her plate. Put on the spot, she hesitantly looked  up. "What? Oh, I'm okay… thank you," she said softly. She wondered briefly what  the expression on Akane's face meant, then realized what it must be and slumped  down even more. <i>I'm making her uncomfortable. Maybe I should just leave… I  don't belong here…</i></p><p>Akane wasn't expecting Ryouga to become even more  depressed at the simple question. <i>Damn… that was the wrong thing to say… I  wish I knew why, though… </i>She tried something else. "That's good! Hey, if  you're feeling up to it tomorrow, would you like to go shopping with me? You've  got an appointment with Dr. Tofu in the afternoon, so we could go afterwards…  maybe get you some new clothes…" She berated herself for mention clothing even  as she said it.</p><p>Ryouga caught the tone in Akane's voice this time. <i>Worry.  She's worried about me? </i>She smiled softly. "Sure. That would be nice."</p><p>Akane didn't understand why she seemed happier now, but  was glad to see that she had cheered the pink-haired girl up a little. "Good.  I'm glad."</p><p>"I'll go with you," Ranma suddenly interjected.</p><p>"<i>Huh?</i>" The two said it in perfect unison.</p><p>Ranma looked a bit miffed at the surprise in their voices.  "Hey, I've got an appointment too, y'know," he said defensively. "Besides, with  the tomboy's fashion sense… I can see it now… all the sundresses…"</p><p>"Hey!" Akane protested. "I don't think you're one to talk,  Mr. red bowtie!" He wasn't actually wearing that shirt at the moment, but the  taunt was enough to upgrade the argument into a full-fledged Ranma-Akane word  war.</p><p>Ryouga watched them for a little while, amazed at how  easily they fell back into old habits. Eventually she gave up and started to  nibble on her food. It didn't seem weird at all, anymore. Everyone was behaving  normally again.</p><p>The argument ended, as it usually did, with a mallet to  Ranma's head. Akane had refrained from using the table, at least. Wiping her  hands off with a great feeling of satisfaction, Akane turned to Ryouga and smiled  again. <i>He seems better now. At least she started to eat again, </i>she  thought, totally oblivious to her inconsistent pronoun use. "*Anyway*," she  said, "as I was *going* to say, I'm glad you're feeling better. You had us all  worried, you know. And I'll make sure baka-brain doesn't follow us tomorrow."</p><p>"I don't mind," Ryouga surprised  them both by saying. "Ranma can come along."</p><p>"What? Are you sure you want him  to?" Akane asked dubiously.</p><p>Ryouga searched for a reason  Ranma shouldn't come and came up blank. Well, actually not quite blank, but she  had a reason for being so nice. "I said Ranma could go with us. I didn't say  anything about *him*.</p><p>It took Akane about zero seconds  flat to understand what she meant. "Oh, I see," she said, trying not to laugh.  "Well, then, I suppose I have nothing against that. We can buy *her* some new  clothes too then, right?"</p><p>Ranma, nursing the rather large  bump he now sported on the top of his head, scowled at them. "I was trying to do  you a favor, pi - er, Ryouga." He had almost called her pig-boy out of habit.</p><p>"And I'm doing you a favor by  convincing Akane to let you come go with us."</p><p>Ranma glared.</p><p>The appointment with Dr. Tofu went well. He was surprised  to see Ryouga up and well so suddenly and soon, but couldn't find anything  wrong with her. Ryouga, for her part, was shocked to find out that she had been  out of it for three days, suffering from exhaustion and malnutrition. That  explained her erratic behavior when she had first arrived, at least. Dr. Tofu  let her go with instructions to keep a low activity level – namely no fighting,  at least for a while – and to stay away from heavy foods. With an otherwise  clean bill of heath, the doctor let her go.</p><p>Ranma – still in male form – was waiting out side the  office, determined not to let them splash him before they went out. Therefore,  he easily dodged the predictable bucket that Akane threw at him upon her exit,  and warily watched as Ryouga followed. However, the other girl was staring at  her feet, seemingly lost in thought, and more importantly didn't seem to have  any source of cold water on her.</p><p>Ryouga looked at him with a neutral expression. "Ranma,  I'm sorry."</p><p>Ranma's eyebrows went into his hairline. "Nani?"</p><p>During the moment in which he was to surprised to react,  Ryouga calmly took the water pistol out of her pocket and shot him… ahem, her,  right between the eyes.</p><p>From behind limp, wet bangs, Ranma-chan glared. She seemed  to be doing that a lot lately, she reflected. "You are going to pay for that,  Ryouga."</p><p>Ryouga smirked arrogantly, proving that yes, guys have  *nothin'* on girls when it comes to the 'holier than thou' look. Her face then  went serious, but not before she gave a sly smile and winked. She didn't know  why she winked. She blocked the memory of ever having winked out of her brain  milliseconds after having done it. But the image was forever burned in the  brain of a certain pig-tailed pseudo-girl, whose eyes grew to saucer-like  proportions, forgetting for a while the mechanics of blinking. It can't really  be blamed on Ryouga, however. She was in the habit of smirking arrogantly,  particularly when she had just beaten – in whatever manner – Ranma, and the sly  smile usually worked to antagonize his rival, even if it was a friendly  rivalry. As for the wink – that never happened, right?</p><p>If Ryouga had remembered the gesture, much less realized  the effect she had on the shell-shocked Ranma, she would quite likely have  repeated the events of chapter one with a considerably less happy ending. But  she didn't, luckily, because that would be a very, very bad thing. As it was,  all she did was say innocently, "Are we going to go shopping now?" She turned  to Akane now, looking normal again. That is, a little downcast but cheered by  having gotten Ranma with the water gun.</p><p>Akane blinked. <i>What the… that was weird…er than usual,  even. </i>"Umm… yeah. Hey, maybe we should stop for lunch, first? I'm a bit  hungry…" she nudged Ranma, who suddenly remembered how to blink and breathe  again.</p><p>"Yeah, lunch sounds good," Ryouga agreed affably.</p><p>Ranma showed considerable annoyance at having to spend the  entire day as a girl, but it was more for show than anything else. She had to  show *something*, and it was better than the alternative.</p><p>Being nice to Ryouga was once thing; she was her friend,  after all. Being openly worried about her was another. She was Ranma Saotome,  and that wasn't her style.</p><p>But she was worried about the pink-haired girl. Not that  she thought Ryouga was still physically unwell; everyone else was concerned  about how weak she had been when she had first arrived, how Dr. Tofu had  diagnosed her with extreme exhaustion and the early stages of starvation.  Ryouga was tougher than that; it wasn't a stretch at all to think that she  could recover in three days, and to hell with the theory that the girl's body  was more frail. Ranma had never had any trouble healing in female form; true,  her endurance may go down, but her recuperation rate never did; if anything, it  sped up to compensate.</p><p>What she was worried about was Ryouga's, well, mental  health. <i>Even *he* was never the most stable person on earth. Not that I  blame him or anything; it had to be tough never being able to stay in one place  for very long, never even being able to go back anywhere except by sheer luck.  Hell, being cursed as a pig almost threw him over the edge, not that it  wouldn't make most people a little bonkers. I think the only reason he didn't  eventually go berserk and demolish a city or two was because of Akane and  'P-chan'. </i>She snorted softly to herself. <i>Did Ryouga really think I kept  that secret because it was fun to taunt him with it? Well, it was – but I  really didn't want him to flip one day and kill someone for eating a pork bun.  At least as P-chan, someone welcomed him home. </i>Ranma was a little surprised  at her own chain of thoughts. <i>Heh. Who knew? </i>And Ryouga's behavior  recently had been very out of character. Wanting to be killed by, rather than  defeating, Ranma, for one. <i>I can get why she wanted me to do it, at least –  it's kind of sick, but it would bring a sense of completion to the business,  and she did try to take me down with her. But why would she want to die without  having avenged herself by killing that Herb guy? </i>Ranma wanted desperately  to ask, but knew that the telling of that story would have to wait. When Ryouga  had told her the original tale, a fierce emotion had burned in her eyes,  something so dark and intense that even after three days Ranma still shuddered  at the memory.</p><p>Ranma didn't let any of her reactions to such musings  show, of course, for previously stated (and probably stupid) reasons. They,  having eaten a lunch consisting of submarine sandwiches, were now at the  clothing store. A woman's clothing store. However much Ryouga disliked the  idea, her figure was just too, well, female, much like Ranma-chan's own, to fit  well in men's clothing. But they still managed to find suitably 'masculine'  clothing for her. Ranma refrained from pointing out that it was useless;  personal experience with a cursed body had shown her that no matter what style  of clothing she wore, it couldn't hide the supermodel-like figure. She would  have mentioned it, actually, if it weren't for the fact that Ryouga herself did  so every time she stepped into the changing booth.</p><p>Eventually, though, they had three sets of clothing for  her, all of very modest cut and of non-skirted nature. Then… they started  shopping for Ranma-chan. Who nearly ran screaming down the streets as they  showed her a remarkable variety of dresses, ranging from a bubble-gum pink,  frilled sundress with a parade of bunnies circling the skirt to a very  revealing, very… erm… *formfitting*, shiny black leather minidress. Ranma  didn't know where they had found it in the otherwise innocuous store. Her only  comment about it was, however, a snide remark that she could wear it if she  wanted to, while Akane "wouldn't be able to squeeze her wide hips in". That had  the much-desired effect of ending the shopping trip, even if Ranma would've  preferred to leave by his own power rather than being dragged out after being  knocked unconscious by Akane's hyperdimensional mallet.</p><p>A splash of hot water woke Ranma  up. After a short argument with Akane – short only because Ryouga proved to be  a remarkably good mediator – they started back to the dojo.</p><p>Ryouga found herself both cheered and depressed by the  trip. On the one side, it was nice going out with people who actually acted  like her friends, and not having to worry about getting lost simply walking  into a room, and on the other it felt as if she were resigning herself to being  a girl, something she had tried to die rather than doing. The only thing that  kept her in a good mood was the knowledge that soon, as soon as she could  convince them that she was in fact healthy, they would go looking for the cure.  She knew that Ranma would help her, because it could possibly be a cure for his  own curse.</p><p>So she took it with good humor when Kasumi herded her back  into bed when she got back, and chided Ranma and Akane for keeping her out so  long. No, rather than protesting she just nodded and headed back into the  storage room, and examined at her reflection in the mirror for a long time.</p><p>She'd pulled her hair back into a ponytail to keep it out  of her eyes, and was dressed in the other one of her old outfits that Kasumi  had altered – only she hadn't finished, and the pants were untouched. They  looked ridiculously baggy on her slender legs, and she'd had to roll up nearly  a foot of each leg, but she approved of this more than the better-fitting set.  With the pants like that, she had been able to tuck the shirt in so it didn't  look like a short dress, and by making the top baggy around her chest, the  combined changes hid a great deal of her figure. Now, if it weren't for the  ridiculous color of her hair…</p><p>She unintentionally followed Kasumi's instructions and  fell asleep sitting in front of the mirror, slumped forward with her forehead  rested against its reflection.</p><p>Keep a' goin', keep a' goin'… don't give up <i>now</i>!</p>
