</div><p>Disclaimer: You know the drill by now. Ranma ½ isn't  mine, never will be, and I'm not making any money off of this. All hail Rumiko  Takahashi… (no, I'm serious. Start hailing. She's amazing ^_^)</p><p>Author's notes: Bad speculators! Bad! (just kidding… more  or less ^_^)</p><p>Although I *am* glad people are finding this  interesting enough to actually put some thought into it. I think some of you  are putting more thought into it than I am!</p><p>*does happy dance* Fifty reviews! *is still  astonished to the point of incoherency* I never thought it would happen! *jumps  up and down* well, I meant to post this early, but this was a busy Friday/Saturday…  it's still Saturday here tho'… 11:51 isn't too late… anyway… I guess I actually  have to give you guys the chapter now, don't I… *sigh*… well, with no further  ado (namely I've got to stop stalling…) here it is, 3.1:</p><p><b><i>Part Three, Chapter One:  Life</i></b></p><p>Ranma had been as surprised as Ryouga to find himself alive.  Something soft that had broken his fall and saved his life had turned out to be  a dried-up pond, which was mud during the dry season. There had been a  farmhouse nearby, and the bewildered farmer, who had come outside to  investigate the damage and try to find out why his land had abruptly lost a  prominent landmark, had found Ranma on his land. He had woken Ranma up and  tried to find out what had happened, but Ranma refused to have any of that and  had immediately insisted that they begin a search for Ryouga.</p><p>And they had found her, limp and unconscious nearly a mile  away in another field, lying half in an irrigation canal and looking mostly  dead. It was entirely possible that Ryouga's bright pink hair had saved her  life.</p><p>The ambulance the farmer had called earlier for Ranma  arrived fifteen minutes later and took both of them to the hospital. It was a  long drive, and the chances they gave Ryouga's survival weren't good.</p><p>Ranma just smiled tiredly at the paramedics. "You'd be  surprised… what he can live through…" he said, and promptly passed out. This  confused the ambulance crew greatly.</p><p>It was entirely possible that the boy was delirious. After  all, judging by his condition, he should have already been unconscious, if not  dead… but the girl was simply a miracle. The chief paramedic, shaking his head  sadly, voiced his prediction that neither of them would survive the drive to  the hospital…</p><p>That paramedic was still half-convinced that he was  dreaming. But no matter how many times he pinched himself, when he came to work  the next day and checked on the two young people he had picked up the day  before, the sight of them both calmly asleep and with steady vital signs just  didn't seem real.</p><p>He shook his head. "No way."</p><p>***<p>Two days later Ranma was awake again. He was still bed-bound, and all four  limbs were wrapped into unusability by layers of gauze and bandage, but he was  awake – if somewhat groggy.</p><p>The doctors were annoying. The questions came slowly, but  they were asked repeatedly until Ranma either gave an answer or convinced them  that he didn't know, both of which took more effort than he felt like using.  "How do you feel?" "Who are you?" "Do you remember what happened?" "Who is the  girl who was with you?" Ranma did his best to answer the questions that didn't  involve long drawn-out explanations, which basically meant that he told them  that he was feeling much better, thank you, and gave them his and Ryouga's  names. For some reason they also felt obliged to ask if the two of them were  married. Ranma gave that one a firm 'no' and glared at the doctor who asked it  until he almost sheepishly rephrased the question into a query about their  relationship, which got a better answer – 'friends'. That was the last  question, and soon afterward they filed out of his room, talking amongst  themselves excitedly.</p><p>Ranma could hear the pair of nurses chittering outside even  after the others had already left. Probably gossiping. He sighed and closed his  eyes, hoping that the heat he felt was only because of the warm bandages and blankets  that they saw fit to cover him with. He wriggled as best he could in the bed,  trying to move. He had gathered the information that he'd been asleep for a few  days from the bits of information that the doctors had tossed at him every so  often, but he had no idea what Ryouga's condition was. From the sound of it,  she was still unconscious. Hopefully not dead. Something in the doctors'  attitudes implied that she wasn't, but she most likely wasn't awake yet, not if  they were asking him her name.</p><p>Ranma yawned. He didn't know how he could possibly be tired,  but he somehow was – it was probably because of the injection that the doctors  had given him. He had hardly noticed it; one had been asking him questions  while the other stuck the needle in his arm.</p><p><i>That was… sneaky… of them…</i></p><p>Ranma fell asleep.</p><p>It was an agonizingly boring wait of three days after that –  during which they still persisted with the questions - before he could finally  cajole a doctor into allowing the nurse to pile him into a wheelchair and take  him to Ryouga's room. He protested he use of a wheelchair, but there would be  no compromise.</p><p>The pink-haired girl's room was eerily silent, far from the  noisy center of the hospital. He didn't ask for the name of the special ward  that she was in.</p><p>"Ryouga?" He tried, tentatively, after a few seconds of  motionlessness on her part. There was no answer.</p><p>"She's been in a coma. It's unlikely that she'll wake up any  time soon," said the nurse, refusing to mention that it was unlikely that she  would ever wake up at all. The boy looked sad enough, and he was still in bad  shape. No need to make the situation worse.</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "He - she'll be okay." The nurse shook her  head sadly at this, but he hadn't looked up, and didn't see.</p><p>He only had ten minutes, and the nurse was there the entire  time, holding loosely onto the IV stand they kept attached to his left arm. He  wished that he knew what the clear fluid constantly dripping into his arm was.  'Saline solution' was what they had told him, but in plain language that seemed  to mean salt water – which didn't make much sense.</p><p>Ryouga had three sterile bags hanging from the IV stand,  twin to Ranma's, that stood silent vigil over her bed. Only one was hooked up  at the moment, the one with the same clear liquid as his. One was half-filled  with a pale yellow liquid that seemed to contain motes of something that caught  the light occasionally, and the other – Ranma refused to look at very closely.  It was almost empty, but the thick red fluid inside persisted, sticking to the  sides of the bag. The nurse took that one down and disposed of it, which  helped.</p><p>They made him leave after precisely ten minutes, but  promised he could stay longer the next day.</p><p>The next day he was allowed to stay for an hour, and after the  first ten minutes the nurse was called away. Ranma leaned against the corner of  the bed. The bandages wrapping his arms and legs had been removed, but there  were still some covering a few of his worse wounds. He had seen them uncovered,  when they were changing his bandages, and was glad that they weren't visible.</p><p>He propped himself up on the corner of the bed, resting his  chin in his hand. Ryouga just laid there, not moving.</p><p>"Y'know, you better live through this." He paused, as if  waiting for an answer. The words echoed slightly in the quiet room.</p><p>"I need you to tell me what'cha did. I felt Shishihoukodan  energy, but there was somethin' else. That wouldn't've done what you did, not  on it's own." The question had been bothering him for days. "What did you do?"</p><p>There was no answer, of course. "Well, I s'pose it can wait  'til you're better. For now… argh, this place is boring. I gave 'em my name and  yours but they can't find anything like an address to call, 'cause the only  Ryouga Hibiki in their computer system is male, they think they've got someone  else, or maybe there just isn't anyone at your house – and I guess my address  just isn't listed with my name anywhere, Saotome's a common enough name but  Ranma's not. It's probably a good thing, I mean; I don't want Akane here  complaining at me…"</p><p>He babbled on in this vein for a few more minutes, talking  about nothing and whatever came to mind.</p><p>Finally he ran out of things to say, and trailed off. He  checked the clock. It had been about an hour, but no one came to collect him,  so he could only assume that they had forgotten. He waited, bored, but at least  the scenery was different. Ryouga had a window, of course, and it showed  something rather more interesting than the wall that was Ranma's view. The  hospital, a surprisingly modern facility, was on the edge of the tiny town,  whatever town it happened to be, next to a forest. It was a pretty forest, but  that wasn't the most interesting thing about the view. What was the most  interesting thing was the fact that it was *only* a forest visible.</p><p>Even now, almost a week later, Ranma could still tell just  by looking that this window used to offer a great view of Horaisan, off in the  distance. The hills surrounding the place where the mountain had been were  still visible, but there was a distinct gap in the middle. Ranma imagined that  he could still see black smoke curling up from the ruins, but of course that  was impossible. All the remnants of that day had long dissipated – except, of  course, the obvious lack of Horaisan.</p><p>The hospital people had been surprisingly uninquisitive  about the events that had led to the destruction of the mountain, even though  it was obvious their patients must have had something to do with it. Ranma got  the distinct impression that there was media pressuring to speak with him, but  he'd asked not to see anyone like that, and to keep their names confidential.  So far, they hadn't been bothered, and he could only assume that the hospital  was keeping up the second part of the bargain too.</p><p>He was half-asleep, leaning against Ryouga's bed, when he  felt a twitch, and snapped back awake. Or at least to some groggy sense of  coherency. "Ryouga?"</p><p>There was a groan from the pink-haired girl, and she moved –  almost wriggled, sliding limbs against the bed as if she was in pain. Which she  probably was. There was a few seconds of this – then her eyes cracked open. And  immediately pressed closed again, accompanied by another groan.</p><p>"Hey, you're awake," Ranma stated the obvious.</p><p>Ryouga froze for a split second, then her eyes snapped open  again, and rolled down as far as they could, trying to see the origin of the  voice. "R-<i>Ranma?</i>"</p><p>Ranma chuckled to cover the immense wash of relief that  suddenly hit him. "Yeah, it's me. Who'd you expect?"</p><p>Ryouga struggled, trying to sit up.</p><p>"Hey hey, don't do that," said Ranma, trying to stop her  from moving too much. "You're not in good shape. The nurse'll be here soon, I'm  su…"</p><p>The door slammed open and the nurse half-ran in, giving  Ranma an angry glare as she reached him. She rolled his wheelchair to the other  side of the room. Ranma didn't see very well what happened next, but it  involved the doctor, a flurry of note-taking, and questions that made Ranma  roll his eyes, reminding him distinctly of when he woke up at first. Sure, it  was a miracle that they were alive, but miracles happened every day. <i>Can't  they just leave it alone?</i></p><p>It was a good fifteen minutes before they settled down.  Ranma rolled himself closer to Ryouga. Ryouga had obviously figured out the  situation by this point, and was submitting to the examination with obvious  reluctance. She spied Ranma coming into her field of view, and gave him a glare  that said, as clear as any words:</p><p><i>You better tell me what the hell happened. </i></p><p>Ranma nodded, ever so slightly, with a half-smile coming to  his face as he responded silently,</p><p><i>Yeah yeah, sure – but you gotta fill me in too. </i></p><p>***<p>However, no amount of asking on their parts would convince the nurse to let  Ranma stay, and he was wheeled back to his room, protesting the entire way.</p><p>Or at least he was still protesting when his complaints  faded from Ryouga's hearing. Ryouga sighed.</p><p><i>A hospital. Oh well. I'm alive. </i>It was strangely  empty thought. <i>Everything's over. We failed. The Kaisufuu's destroyed. </i>She  could remember clearly, almost too clearly, what had happened. She'd been  climbing the rocks, almost giddy with how close she was to success, and found a  crack in the stone big enough to reach her hand into. She had found something,  even, grasped something thin and metallic – the handle, obviously - when Herb  had grabbed her neck and pulled her away from the stone, holding her in midair  by the throat.</p><p>Wait.</p><p><i>I still had the handle in my hand when I came to – which  means… </i>she couldn't quite think of the next logical step in the sequence -  her mind was too fuzzed with whatever medicine it was the doctor had given her.  It was obviously something rather potent, and was making her exhausted. With  little preamble, she soon fell asleep again.</p><p>She solved the mystery in her dreams, but forgot when she  woke up again the next day.</p><p>Ranma woke up with a start, shouting something incoherent.  There had been a dream – but three seconds in the dark stillness of the  hospital room drained away the memory. He wiped cold sweat off his forehead,  the only remnant of the dream – or nightmare – other than a disconcerting  feeling deep in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>He laid back down. There seemed to be little reason to stay  up. He squinted at the clock. It was after one am. He sighed, no longer tired  in the least. He had been asleep for about twelve hours already, after all. The  hospital seemed to like making him sleep. It was better than the mind-numbing  boredom of staying awake, at least…</p><p>He shifted, trying to get into a more comfortable position,  since it looked like sleeping was the only viable option at the moment. The  hospital was dead silent in the middle of the night – a beam of light snuck its  way into his room through the crack under the door, and that was the only sign  that there was life anywhere in the building.</p><p>Ranma rolled unto his back, and sighed faintly. Looking up  all he could see was the black ceiling. Sleeping was a simple impossibility –  he had been doing almost nothing but sleeping for the past few days, and his  body was firm in his insistence to stay awake. Besides, the thoughts wouldn't  leave him alone…</p><p>Their chance at a cure for Ryouga had failed, crushingly. <i>He's  trapped forever, now… </i>he was surprised at the sympathetic pain the thought  brought, a sudden tense pain in his throat. <i>What… what's going to happen  now? What will he do? Will he keep trying to kill himself? Eventually he'll  succeed… What will </i>I<i> do? </i>Ranma's hand clenched the sheet at his  side. <i>Should I keep stopping him? Should I let him have what he wants? Would  I want to die, in his place? </i>Ranma doubted it. <i>I'm not sure I even  understand… and I can't let him die…</i></p><p>It was the understanding that made it so uncomfortable,  Ranma suddenly realized. He had never experienced the same hopelessness as  Ryouga did now… but he had come close. Very close – although of course he had  never shown it. <i>Ryouga's always been more open than me. I can't show  weakness, can't cry… but he can. He wears his emotions on his sleeve, right  there for anyone who wants to look. Even when he wants to hide his feelings, he  can't… but now he's different. He's trying to hide things from me, and I can  tell there's something there… but not what. </i>It had been frustrating Ranma  ever since Ryouga had appeared that day on the streets of Nerima. <i>He gave up  the old secret when he told Akane he loved her, but now there's a new one,  something he won't tell me and I can't figure it out. Maybe he's just more  reserved now… but that doesn't seem right…</i></p><p>He sighed, rolled onto his side, and stared at the wall for  a few more minutes before falling asleep again, his thoughts no clearer than  before.</p><p>Back in Nerima:</p><p>"No explanation has yet been found for the mysterious  explosion of Horaisan. The two potential witnesses found near the scene are  still hospitalized and unavailable for questioning." After several days of  nothing new – the exhaustive search of the rubble that was the mountain had yet  to produce any results - the short blurb was the only update on the situation  on the official news. There was massive noise about the event available on  other programs, but it was all speculation and theory, in the end, and none of  it came close to what Akane believed was the truth anyway.</p><p>She sighed and turned off the television. The two witnesses  they kept talking about had to be Ranma and Ryouga. But there was nothing they  could do. Because of the widespread news stories, the hospital simply wasn't  accepting any calls with regards to the witnesses, not yet at least, and even  the media couldn't get its hands on the names. Apparently they were still in  bad condition, which was worrying.</p><p>At least, she hoped that the two people everyone kept  talking about. It could just as easily be two of the Musk Dynasty members.  Akane chose not to think about that possibility.</p><p>She was startled out of her thoughts by a great clattering  noise from the kitchen, and a shout of surprise in Kasumi's voice. Akane jumped  up and ran to see what had happened.</p><p>"The shelf broke…" her older sister had already fetched a  broom and was beginning to sweep up the great mess that was most of the dishes  they owned smashed to shards on the tile floor.</p><p>Even as Akane ran to grab a dustpan and help clean, there  was another shout, although this one was more like a curse.</p><p>"My sandal!" That was Genma's voice. Akane didn't bother to  investigate.</p><p>Kasumi shook her head.</p><p>"You don't actually believe in bad omens, do you sister?"  Akane asked, trying to be lighthearted although she wasn't sure she wasn't  starting to believe herself. Just minutes before the news broadcast had aired  about Horaisan for the first time, the shelf holding up the Tendo family shrine  had broken. Strange things had been happening ever since… it was probably  coincidence, but it still bugged her where she wouldn't admit it, and didn't  reassure her at all about the condition of Ranma and Ryouga.</p><p>Kasumi didn't pause in her sweeping. "We'll just have to  wait and see…" she looked up at her sister. "Don't worry too much, Akane," she  reassured her. "I'm sure he's just fine."</p><p>Akane snorted. "I'm not worried about that jerk!" It was a  blatant lie – but Kasumi was kind enough not to point that out.</p><p>Returning to the main story… at a hospital, somewhere in the  middle of Japan:</p><p>It was another week before Ryouga could walk again. Ranma  spent the entire time allowing the doctors to keep him drugged, not letting  them know that he didn't need it anymore. Everyday, he visited Ryouga, each day  for a little longer. He was always a bit giddy from the drugs, never entirely  coherent, but he preferred it that way.</p><p>But every night, the drugs would wear off faster than the  doctors realized. And on that day, when during his visit to Ryouga he could  tell that she was healed enough, he slipped out of bed, ignoring the protests  of his body claiming it was tired, and carefully creaked open the doors.</p><p>The security of the hospital didn't have a chance. Ranma  wasn't exactly a ninja, but he knew how to be silent, and the hospital wasn't  expecting anything from him – after all, he'd been such a good patient up until  that point. It was a simple task for him to sneak into Ryouga's room.</p><p>He hadn't been expecting there to be a nurse standing watch  over her, scribbling something into a notepad, so he was noticed when he  slipped inside. There was no choice - he knocked her unconscious, gently. He  felt a twinge of guilt, but knew there was no other option – even if Ryouga  didn't agree, they would have to escape now. If they were still there when the  nurse awoke, they would put him under tighter security and he didn't want to  have to fight his way out of a hospital.</p><p>He leaned down and shook Ryouga's shoulder. "Hey, wake up!"  he whispered in her ear, and her eyes snapped open.</p><p>"Wha… Ranma?" She blinked rapidly, trying to wake up on  sudden notice. "What are you doing?"</p><p>"Shh!" he held a finger to his lips. "We're gettin' out of  here," he whispered.</p><p>Ryouga just stared at him for a moment. "Are you insane?"  she whispered back, fiercely.</p><p>"No," Ranma answered slowly, straightening. "I'm right.  We've gotta leave. If we lived Herb did too, you know I'm probably right. And  if she's alive, she's gonna come after us. I don't want to get the hospital  caught in the crossfire. Horaisan was remote. This place isn't. Now c'mon, I  know you're better now."</p><p>"I…" Ryouga hesitated. "You're right." She nodded curtly,  pulling herself shakily to her feet.</p><p>"Can you do this on your own?" Ranma asked, placing a hand  on her shoulder to steady her. She pushed it off.</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>They left. It was a surprisingly simple job to climb out the  window and to freedom, even with Ryouga's condition the way it was. The only  thing they took with them was a bag that the hospital had collected of Ryouga's  belongings – a few things that had been found scattered about the countryside  that were presumably from her pack. Ranma had managed to collect real clothing  on his trip to Ryouga's room from a cart full of clean laundry, and they were  nondescript enough in pale jeans and white t-shirts not to be questioned by  anyone as they simply walked out of the town along a convenient highway,  following the signs to Tokyo.</p><p>"What did you <i>do</i>?" Ranma didn't wait very long before  asking the question. "It's been buggin' me. I mean – you destroyed a <i>mountain</i>."</p><p>Ryouga didn't look at him, keeping her eyes fixed on the  road ahead instead. "Breaking point," she answered simply.</p><p>"Bakusai Tenketsu…" Ranma murmured to himself. "How did  that…"</p><p>She looked at him out of the corner of her eye, now, or at  least she may have been looking at him. He wasn't quite sure, and it was mildly  disconcerting. "I also used the Shishihoukodan."</p><p>Ranma nodded at that. "I felt that. So that's what you used  on Herb… I guess… it was a strong one, and the mountain couldn't withstand just  broke apart under the pressure…?" Ranma didn't quite believe his reasoning as  he said it.</p><p>Ryouga shook her head. "Didn't you hear what I said? I said  I used the Bakusai Tenketsu. <i>And </i>the Shishihoukodan."</p><p>"Ah…" For a moment, he was confused. Then it clicked. "You  mean you <i>linked </i>them!"</p><p>Ryouga nodded, the slight curl of a smile twitching on the  edges of her expression. "Yeah. Right under Herb. The blast was supposed to go  up, but… I guess you were right, the mountain was already shaken by everything  that had already happened, so it exploded instead. Or I actually managed to hit  the breaking point of the mountain itself. I can't remember, exactly."</p><p>Ranma couldn't think of a response to that for a moment.  "That's…" Ryouga's expression froze. Ranma hesitated, confused by the sudden  draining of expression from her face. "…pretty damn cool," he finished a moment  later.</p><p>The half-smile returned, and grew a little. "Thanks."</p><p><i>Wha… what was that all about? </i>Ranma couldn't remember  Ryouga ever reacting like that before. But… <i>it was almost like he was afraid  of what I was going to say. </i></p><p>"Ryouga…" he trailed off, wondering why he was saying this.  "I'm sorry."</p><p>Ryouga froze. Ranma had to stop so he wouldn't leave her  behind. "Sorry for what? It was my fault."</p><p><i>What? </i>"It wasn't anybody's fault," he contradicted  her. "But… I said I'd do whatever I could to help you, and I didn't. And I'm  sorry I failed." It was hard to apologize, harder to admit failure. But he had  meant his promise – and Ranma Saotome kept promises.</p><p>Ryouga, unexpectedly, started walking again. "It's not <i>your</i>  fault," she repeated. "I knew it was impossible, but I risked your life  anyway." She walked faster than before.</p><p>He jogged a little to catch up with her, falling into step  just behind her. "You just won't stop, will you?"</p><p>Ryouga didn't answer.</p><p>"It's always you. Never let anyone else try anything, it's  always Ryouga, a one-man island…"</p><p>"One-woman island, you mean," Ryouga interrupted.</p><p>Ranma dismissed that with a wave. "Doesn't matter…"</p><p>"How can you say that?" Ryouga asked, anger spilling into  her voice. "How can you – of <i>all</i> people – say that doesn't matter?"</p><p>"It doesn't! Look, I've been stuck too, I'm sure we'll find  another way to cure you-"</p><p>"And what if we don't?"</p><p>"We'll…"</p><p>"You can't say that… but I know what I'll do."</p><p>"Ryouga, suicide's not-"</p><p>She whirled, suddenly, and in a flurry of pink hair Ryouga  was facing Ranma. They were almost nose-to-nose – would have been if it weren't  for their height difference. He barely avoided walking into her, but managed to  stop just before impact. Ryouga didn't move, not even to flinch. "Suicide… it's  kinda like a cheat, isn't it? I've almost died enough times now to realize that  it wouldn't really solve anything except making you feel bad and trapping me as  a girl forever in hell. Besides, my ancestors must be protecting me, because no  matter how many times I try I just can't kill myself. So…" she blushed faintly,  smiled even less noticeably. "I shouldn't make the same mistake twice…"</p><p>Ranma had been wondering why she wasn't backing away from  their close proximity, but at least now that was explained.</p><p>Because while it was a very light touch, that was most  definitely a kiss…</p><p>***<p>~Mordain</p><p>AN: I don't feel like commenting on this. It should be  self-explanatory! Ja!</p>
