</div><p>Disclaimer: I don't own Ranma 1/2. Rumiko Takahashi  and Viz (and possibly some others I'm forgetting) hold the legal rights. Hey,  an actual disclaimer is a useful thing once in a while…</p><p>Author's Note: I apologize for my inability to write  fight scenes.</p><p>More notes: I'm getting there, I'm getting there!  This chapter, number twelve by my count, is being released around the second  anniversary of the first, but no worries, I'm not planning on stopping it at  this point! Even though there have been long gaps, revisions (I'm working on a  few even now), this fic is not stopping until it's finished – and it's not yet.  Do I even still have any of my original readers, or have you all given up on  me? Oh well… anyway, I know I'm not the best of authors nor am I the most  popular, but I'd like to thank anyone who's still reading this! Enjoy the last  chapter of part two, and don't forget to review!</p><p>Part Two, Chapter Nine: Explosion on Horaisan</p><p>Ranma cursed and dove, reaching the water in one smooth  leap. <i>Please don't be dead please don't be dead… </i>he chanted mentally as  he swam through the turbulent water to reach Ryouga, even as it was still being  pelted with crumbling fragments of stone.</p><p>Herb had dodged the blast with only the mildest of injuries  after tossing Ryouga's limp body negligently aside – directly towards the  water, but not out of the range of the spray of stone fragments. She started to  move to stop Ranma but held back. She shook her head a large chunk of rock  missed Ranma by inches. It wasn't worth it. She hadn't seen the shape of the  boulder that had just been demolished, just her adversary climbing up its side.  Else she might have been a little more upset.</p><p>The only thing that Mint and Lime noticed was that their  captive wasn't their captive anymore, and he had attacked their master. They  charged, screaming outrage.</p><p>Herb held up a hand to stop them and they skidded to a halt,  confused. An errant throwing knife pinged off of a falling rock that fell just  in time in front of Ranma's neck. "Master Herb?" the two lackeys questioned in  unison. Herb hushed them, and pointed at Ranma.</p><p>The pair watched, confused, as Ranma – now female from the  rescue - pulled Ryouga's limp body out of the water and carried her to the  shore, knocking the last few bits of rubble away. She checked for a pulse as  she laid Ryouga gently on the ground but it didn't seem to reassure Ranma at  all; if anything she looked more worried as she started a clumsy attempt at  CPR. Water bubbled out of the pink-haired girl's mouth but there was no sign of  life. Herb smirked.</p><p>"She is dead." Ranma ignored Herb's proclamation. "She was  weak, and paid the price for her error. Will you leave now that she whom you  protected is dead, or will you foolishly attempt to avenge her? If you leave  now I will spare your life, I have no quarrel with you."</p><p>"Bastard…" Ranma spat the word out loudly enough for the  insult's target to hear. Herb bristled. She even took a step forward – but  didn't attack.</p><p>Ranma leaned down a little more than was necessary to check  Ryouga's pulse again, and whispered in her ear. "Ryouga, if you can hear me –  don't move. I'm gonna challenge Herb." She didn't even twitch. Ranma hoped that  that was a good sign. She stood, faced her adversary, and took three slow steps  in her direction. Mint and Lime moved to protect their master, but Herb pushed them  away and they retreated into the forest, close enough to watch but not  interfere.</p><p>"You challenge me to a duel? Very well. I accept." Herb  grinned.</p><p>"I wasn't planning on lettin' you decline…" said Ranma, not  smiling. This was… too much. Killing crossed the line. <i>Even if she didn't…  she meant to. </i></p><p>The battle began.</p><p>***<br/>Ryouga felt as dead as Herb thought she was. Dead, but her ears seemed to be  working. She heard Ranma's voice, felt the warmth of his breath on her ears. <i>He  saved me again… </i></p><p>It took a little bit of effort to tell for certain that she  was alive, however. She was feeling very definitively waterlogged, and she  couldn't think clearly for the pain. Her body spasmed with involuntary coughs,  each one bringing water up with it. She couldn't taste anything, but she had  the vague suspicion that if she could, it would be the ferrous taste of blood.  But she couldn't, and each cough made it easier to breathe even if each breath  hurt. She concentrated on nothing but breathing for several minutes.</p><p>Ryouga could still feel Herb's hand around her neck above  everything else. It was as if the talons were still digging into soft skin  where an Adam's apple should be – but that was impossible. She could hear  Herb's voice, now, and it was more distant. Ranma was probably trying to keep  the fight far away, trying to keep her safe. Ryouga mentally scoffed that idea.  <i>Why bother protecting me… </i></p><p>Now feeling somewhat better – or at least not half-drowned  anymore - she managed to force herself into a more comfortable position,  half-sitting up against a rock. It was during that she realized exactly how  battered she was. She had been mostly unconscious for most of what had  happened, but it was easy enough to put together vague memories from evidence  at hand. Falling in the water had probably saved her a lot of injury. The  kettle-stone had been blasted into gravel, but even gravel would have hurt her  seriously in her current condition – if the water hadn't protected her from  much of the impact. Of course, her back hadn't been spared anything, but that  pain was local, and minor compared to the agony in her chest from being  suffocated and then nearly drowned. That pain was fading, however, with every  breath of fresh air. At least all the water had drained out of her lungs.</p><p>She spent a few minutes resting, watching what she could see  of the fight from her vantage point. She sighed, coughed painfully, made a  mental note not to do that again, and looked down. <i>Well, you can't say  anything 'bout his determination, but this can't be good… I have to do  something. Besides, they're coming this way again…</i></p><p>Gingerly she shook her head to dry out her hair, sending  sparkling drops flying in a wide radius. She coughed purposefully, testing her  throat, and while it hurt slightly, it wasn't nearly so bad any more. She  started to push herself up into a standing position, but an unexpected pain in  her hand sent her back to the ground.</p><p>It didn't take long to figure out why, but it did take a  moment of effort to unclench her fist. All though fled her mind when she  finally did. She stared at the object it contained blankly for a moment. It  stared back, sitting innocently in her hand atop a vivid red mark. She looked  up, blankly, at the fight between Ranma and Herb. Then she looked back down. <i>So  I did find it…</i></p><p>It was the broken-off handle of a small, and very ornate,  teakettle.</p><p>***<br/>"Amaguriken!"</p><p>Herb grinned as she dodged or deflected each and every punch  that Ranma threw and countered with a single strike of her own to Ranma's head.  It missed, of course, but in the moment when the two were unmoving after Ranma  jumped away, it was painfully obvious as to who was winning the fight,  especially when Ranma had to struggle for purchase on slippery stone with an  injured leg - and Herb stood her ground, unshaken.</p><p>Several trees had been blasted down as a result of more  Mouko Takabishas than Ranma could ever remember using in a single fight before,  and a spiral smudge in the dirt bore witness to Ranma's attempt at a Hiryu  Shoten Ha. Ranma simply couldn't think of a way to get her angry; her chi was  so cold this fight that the special attack hadn't had a chance. Herb, on the  other hand, was having great luck making Ranma almost – <i>almost </i>– wish  that she hadn't taken on this fight.</p><p>Herb ended the brief pause with a quick slice of her arm  through the air. "Hito Ryu-zan Ha!"</p><p>Ranma nearly fell backwards trying to dodge the barrage of  knife-like chi bullets, but one glanced her shoulder and tore through fabric  and flesh, slicing off her left sleeve and leaving a long shallow gash that  welled blood in a way that couldn't be healthy. She winced.</p><p>Nothing was working. Ranma's mind whirled, but nothing was  working. For once in her life, Ranma Saotome was out of ideas. But she charged  again anyway, trying to keep in melee. Range was far too much of a deathtrap.</p><p>A flurry of punches, a failed leg sweep – Ranma leapt over  it and tried a spinning kick for Herb's head. It connected, but with armor  brought up to block rather than skull, and slid off harmlessly. It went on like  this for a while, neither side able to gain clear advantage, but finally Ranma  connected a punch to Herb's right shoulder, just under the armor. Herb's  counter was simple, just as improvised, but deadly effective – a glowing green  knife of energy sprung from the first two fingers of her left hand.</p><p>Ranma was backflipping away when she was knocked out of the  air by Herb's slash. Caught surprised, it took everything she could muster just  to land on her feet. Even so, she stumbled.</p><p>Ranma knew she was lucky. In a way. Herb had hit her back,  and the knife – which Herb dismissed, since Ranma didn't attack again – could  have easily cut into her spine and injured her more seriously, permanently –  possibly fatally. As it was, Herb had sliced the muscles below her right  shoulder, and she could feel the energy draining out of that arm. Combined with  her other injury, both her arms were now nearly useless…</p><p>Ranma was used to the feeling of failure – in a way. There  was always something she was able to do to make a comeback. But there would be  no rematch. This *was* the rematch, and Ranma had nothing. It was actual  defeat, and that was something entirely new…</p><p>***<br/>Ryouga watched Ranma stumble back from Herb. <i>He's alright. Good sign. As if  anything would help now.</i> Taking another look at the object she held in her  hand, she took a deep breath and shakily pulled herself to her feet.</p><p>"Hey, Herb!"</p><p>The shout tried to choke in her throat but she managed to  get it out, and even if it was weak Herb's ears were sharp and she heard. Her  eyes widened. "You're dead!" she called back, turning and raising her unhurt  left arm for the finishing move, but Ryouga held up what her hand was holding,  and Herb froze. Black electricity died in her fingertips.</p><p>"The kettle's broken! It'll never work now!" Ryouga pointed  at the rock. It was entirely demolished; the last few remaining pieces had  fallen during the battle. There was no sign of the Kaisufuu – other than the  piece Ryouga held. "The kettle was in the rock, and he blasted it to pieces!  We're *both* stuck like this, forever!"</p><p>"Hito Ryu-zan Ha!" But Ryouga had collapsed to the ground,  and the knives flew over her head, reducing a few trees tens of meters behind  her to shreds.</p><p>Ryouga looked up, wondering what would happen now, hoping  impossibly for something to happen. And something did. Herb was glowing,  displaying a true battle aura for the first time. It was a ferocious one,  composed of pure anger and hatred, deep red – and hot.</p><p>Hot enough to make Ranma's course of action painfully clear.</p><p>She was relieved, of course, that Ryouga was alive. The  kettle was broken, so now Ranma would never be able to use it to cure her own  curse, and Ryouga was stuck… the sympathy she felt for Ryouga resonated  somewhere.</p><p>She didn't understand, and she didn't dwell on it. She  couldn't.</p><p>Moving with all the speed she could muster she was attacking  Herb once again, less then a second spent in any sort of contemplation of the  situation. She punched Herb, just a straight punch with little technique behind  it, and there wasn't much strength there either – but it was something to start  the sequence of events that somehow had to happen.</p><p>It didn't have any obvious effect. Herb had been facing away  but was hardly caught by surprise. She whirled, striking Ranma's fist with the  tip of her shoulder armor in the process. Ranma barely noticed the pain as she  threw another punch, missed, and retreated… in a curving path instead of a  straight line. Herb, blinded with anger, took the bait.</p><p>Ranma could feel strength draining out of her as she led  Herb in the spiral. Every third blow or so that Herb countered with connected,  and every muscle ached, but she kept going. Soon Herb wasn't countering anymore  but rather attacking; all Ranma had to do was back up, keep to the spiral…</p><p>Finally Ranma stood on the second-to-last step of a perfect  spiral, aura-heated air swirling around her invigoratingly. She took a deep  breath and the last step.</p><p>"Hiryu…" A hit to the stomach almost winded her in the  middle of the phrase. "Shoten… Ha!" She punched hard, up into the air, her  disheveled hair flying like a fire on the top of her head.</p><p>But Herb, master of chi, was once again not caught unawares.  The attack had already failed once on her, and once was enough. Her aura turned  blue and freezing a split second before Ranma's punch. And, indeed, a tornado  appeared – flinging Ranma high into the air but leaving Herb, in its center,  safe on the ground.</p><p>She stepped out of the whirlwind and turned to Ryouga.  "Still alive? Well, I don't know how, but you won't be for much longer… now  that that little mosquito is out of the way…"</p><p>Ryouga shook her head, looked at the kettle handle she still  held, and chuckled, but the laugh ended in a hacking cough. "I'm dead, am I…  and Ranma's dead already… and I'm a girl forever… but so are you…"</p><p>Herb took a step closer. "You're wrong on the last, little  girl… shame, killing someone so weak as you almost isn't-"</p><p>Ryouga held up one finger to her lips. Herb cut off in  mid-sentence, involuntarily. She bristled, and her angry red aura appeared  again. It seemed to be automatic. She opened her mouth to continue, but was  quieted again by something even more unexpected.</p><p>Ryouga reversed the direction of her finger and pressed it  hard into the ground. "Wrong." Ryouga said the word in a rasping whisper. "My  weakness… doesn't matter."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Ryouga squeezed her eyes closed and pressed her finger into  the ground, ignoring when it started to bleed, ignoring everything. It didn't  take long. "Bakusai Tenketsu… revised."</p><p>For a moment nothing happened. Then there was the smallest  of shakes in the ground like a distant earthquake but rather than settling  quickly it grew, until pebbles bounced on the ground and larger rocks cracked.  A deep rumbling sound from the bowels of the mountain worked its way up into  the realm of human hearing and a spider's web of tiny cracks appeared in the  supposedly solid rock, spewing beams of black light and torrents of darkened  water that shot up into the sky, dimming the daylight. The drops didn't fall  back to the surface quite yet, however…</p><p>Herb backed off, trying to find someplace stable, trying to  figure out what was going on. The only thing her senses told her made no sense…</p><p>"Heavy chi-?"</p><p>There was no more time to think. Horaisan exploded in a  cloud of darkness.</p><p>End Part 2</p><p>~Mordain</p><p>More Author's notes (you know you love it): Thanks and  credit to ArchmageSilvento for pulling me out of my block on this story, and  giving me two of the major ideas that happened here and will be explained  better in the following chapters.
