</div><p>Disclaimer: I don't own… well, much of anything  really… and certainly not Ranma ½. As much as I would like to…</p><p>AN: Yay! I'm actually finishing this Part 2! W00t!  Here I come, Part 3! ^_^</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>Part Two, Chapter Seven  – A Literal Chase At Last</i></b></p><p>Walk. Walk. Walk some more.</p><p>Ranma was getting seriously annoyed. He glanced back at  Ryouga, who was following behind him with a determined expression on her face.  It hadn't changed since… well, since that fight.</p><p>"Do you want to stop yet?" Ranma really did. He usually  didn't mind keeping on the move all day, but this was getting ridiculous. It  had to be well past midnight – the moon had already risen and set. It wasn't  dawn yet, but Ranma figured that that couldn't be too far off. What made it  worse was that it was the *third time*…</p><p>The pink-haired girl just shook her head. "No. It's this  way, I know it is."</p><p>Ranma sighed in exasperation. "Look, Ryouga…"</p><p>"No. We keep going."</p><p>"But…!"</p><p>"You can stop if you want."</p><p>Ranma growled under his breath. He should've known something  different was up when Ryouga suddenly snapped awake in the middle of the night  after that fight with Herb and yelled one word – 'left'. Ranma had barely  understood Ryouga's frenzied explanation at such an hour, but he had rolled  open the map they'd bought – which obstinately had no mountains near them, much  less one named Horaisan. Not to mention that it was different in scale,  orientation, and style than the other one. It was impossible to compare to the  map that they had lost, but it was the best alternative they had been able  find.</p><p>Ranma had fallen asleep again while Ryouga had stayed up all  night playing with the map, twisting it around and muttering to herself,  obviously trying to match it up with her vague memories of the other map.  They'd tried this before, but nothing had come of it. When he'd woken up in the  morning, she'd fallen asleep at the table, still holding the pen that she'd  used to mark a circle on the map. She was convinced that their destination was  there.</p><p>Even though it was marked as nothing but rolling farmland  for miles and miles, with nothing more than a ridge of hills beyond that…</p><p>That had been two days ago, and all that time Ranma had had  to lead. Ryouga was as hopeless as ever at following a map. Her miraculously acquired  sense of direction notwithstanding, she still had no experience with actually  finding her way to a destination.</p><p>So Ranma was leading, knowing that if he even tried to stop  Ryouga would keep walking in a straight line until she either found the Kaisufuu  or strode off a cliff into the Pacific.</p><p>"Ryouga…" they'd spotted their likely destination, the  mapped ridge of hills that were now visible in the near distance, a while ago.  They'd known about that, but what hadn't been marked on the map was a single  rocky peak that rose above the rest. That was probably it…</p><p>"Keep walking!" her voice fell at the end of the statement,  however. "We'll… we can stop after this hill, ok?" The exhaustion was finally  slipping into her voice. Ranma sighed.</p><p>"Alright." It wasn't that far; Ranma could see their target,  a lone tree at the crest of the gentle rise they were climbing. It nice and  grassy up there, Ranma could see by the starlight. It would be a good place to  camp, and it wasn't but a few hundred feet off.</p><p>A few hundred feet that felt like miles when it was coupled  with the taunting promise of rest and sleep, however. Ranma hadn't been this  tired in a long time…</p><p>The relief of relaxation wasn't all that greeted him at the  top, however. A sprawling farmhouse, windows dark against the night, was at the  bottom of a considerably steeper drop on the other side.</p><p>"Ah ha!" Ryouga exclaimed in triumph.</p><p>"What?" Ranma turned to look at the madly grinning girl.  "It's just a house…"</p><p>"That place was on the map!" Ryouga crowed, ignoring him. "I  told you! We're almost there!" She was practically beaming… hell, she <i>was</i>  beaming.</p><p>Ranma just settled down on the ground and fished a blanket  out of his pack. "Okay, okay, so you were right, happy?" He gestured towards  the hills. "That's probably it, and we can ask at that house in the morning to  check." He leaned back against the tree and pulled the blanket to cover  himself. Almost immediately he was asleep.</p><p>Ryouga, satisfied at making so much progress fell asleep  without even bothering with a blanket. Her head rested against her pack like it  was a pillow, a small smile gracing her face…</p><p>"Horaisan!"</p><p>"What? Speak up!"</p><p>Ranma felt like strangling the old man, nevermind his policy  of not bullying the weak. Some bastards deserved it…! Ryouga detected his anger  and glanced in Ranma's direction, frowning slightly. Ranma took a step back at  this, letting Ryouga finish."</p><p>"Horaisan! The mountain! Have you seen anyone else going  there?" She practically bellowed it directly into his ear. Ranma blinked, but  the image of the bullhorn in Ryouga's hand vanished. <i>Great, now I'm seeing  things! First… *that*, now I'm going insane!</i></p><p>The wizened old man jumped back a little, startled.  "Horaisan?" he repeated, surprised.</p><p>"Yes! Horaisan! Have you seen anyone else going there?"</p><p>"You don't want to go to Horaisan." The old man leaned  heavily on his cane, resting his chin on his hands as if he couldn't stand  under his own power.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Yes yes, those three travelers… I told them not to go to  Horaisan. You shouldn't go there, either."</p><p>"Is that it?" Ryouga pointed towards the mountain. "Were  they going there?"</p><p>The old man squinted, following her finger. After a moment  of searching for the right direction, he nodded. "I warn you though, it's  dangerous-"</p><p>"Thanks!" And Ryouga was off before the old man could finish  his sentence, dragging a bewildered Ranma behind her.</p><p>"Watch out for the monsters!" But the two were already  merely specks in the distance. The old man sighed. "They'll find out soon  enough…"</p><p>"This… <i>this</i> wasn't on the damn map?" Ranma stared up  the sheer cliff face and blanched slightly, intimidated although he'd never  admit it. It was more impressive then it seemed in the distance.</p><p>"Beats me…" Ryouga looked up as well and could almost feel  her spirits falling. "Do you think you can scale that?"</p><p>"I think so…" Ranma placed one hand on a promising potential  foothold and pressed. The stone crumbled under the stress. "…or not." He tried  another outcropping.</p><p>Ryouga stepped up to the wall and glanced each way. Up, down  – nothing. Left, no… right… "Hey, what about…" Suddenly she caught a rustle of  movement out of the corner of her eye. Ranma saw it to, and as one they spun  around to see –</p><p>Nothing. Then Ryouga glanced up.</p><p>"Hey!" Three blurry figures had appeared more than halfway  up the cliff, where it sloped to a slightly less imposing angle. They had  apparently come from the side…</p><p>Ranma and Ryouga had just enough time to see Herb's face,  smirking confidently down at them. Then they were gone…</p><p>"How are they climbing so fast?" Ranma exclaimed.</p><p>"Great! How are we going to catch up with them?" Ryouga said  at almost the same time. She looked wildly around. "There!" It wasn't much, the  holds placed too far apart for her to reach. "We can-" She turned to face  Ranma, but he was gone. "Where-"</p><p>"Here!" Ranma called from a ledge nearly twenty feet up.  "Jump!" He stretched a hand down. "I'll pull you!"</p><p>With a running leap Ryouga managed to lock one hand firmly  with Ranma. The other one scrambled for purchase on the cliff, and in a few  seconds she was safely on the ledge, looking dazed. Her head spun, and despite  the urgency of the situation, she could only think of holding Ranma's hand in  her own. <i>Why…</i></p><p>Ranma had already started to jump up again. "C'mon!" he  shouted, reaching out to help her again.</p><p>Without even thinking Ryouga leapt for it, scrambling for  the scant purchase that Ranma had found. It didn't offer much rest, though,  because then he was off again and her along with him. Together they ran up the  mountain, helping each other when necessary. It wasn't until Ryouga landed on  the soft grass at the top, hand still holding Ranma's, that she realized that  she hadn't really needed the help. She certainly didn't need to be holding his  hand <i>now</i>… but…</p><p>A growling noise started in the bushes in front of them, and  soon they were surrounded by the noise, along with dozens of pairs of eyes  peering between leaves…</p><p>The two tensed for action. Then their adversary stepped out,  and they froze in confusion. A… monkey? Then the rest of the troop stepped out,  and they understood the threat. When that many teeth and claws were bared,  monkeys were a perfectly viable enemy…</p><p>But for all the obvious aggression, the apes didn't attack.  They seemed confused, actually, although still hostile of course.</p><p>As a mater of fact, the monkeys were confused. The other  three to come up were clearly out of their league, carrying the sprits of the  tiger, wolf, and dragon with them, but these two…</p><p>The boy emitted the aura of a cutely smiling girl. But the  girl… her aura couldn't make up her mind between just herself, an angry and  dangerous dark-haired boy, and, curiously enough, a small black pig. The first  and the last were harmless, but the second…</p><p>The apes attacked anyway.</p><p>"Ouch! Damnit… take that, you stupid monkeys!"</p><p>It was a long an vicious battle – well, not really - but  finally the enemy was defeated. The monkeys fled, leaving the two wondering if  they should feel proud of their victory.</p><p>In the end, they decided they'd lost anyway, in losing track  of Herb.</p><p>"Damnit! They could be anywhere in this forest!" Ranma  grumbled, pushing a clump of vines out of his way angrily.</p><p>"Yeah…" Ryouga agreed sourly. She poked a rock, and it  exploded. The Bakusai Tenketsu was a good stress reliever.</p><p>"Ow! What was that?"</p><p>Ranma and Ryouga looked at each other. Slowly, they each  reached out a hand to push a pair of branches away…</p><p>Lime and Mint didn't notice. They were apparently too intent  on whatever their task was, and Mint on complaining about bees or something as  he wiped a small trickle of blood from his forehead. Ranma and Ryouga looked at  each other, not believing the opportunity.</p><p>They let the branches fall back into place as they  conferenced.</p><p>"Herb's not with them. That's a lucky break…" Ryouga  commented.</p><p>"Yeah. She must be resting or something… I can handle these  two. They might be able to tell me where the Kaisufuu is… you keep looking,  ok?"</p><p>Ryouga nodded curtly. "You sure?"</p><p>"Yeah." Ranma smirked. "Piece 'o cake."</p><p>They headed off in their separate directions. Ranma paused.  "Just don't take on Herb before I get back, ok?" he called. When there was no  response, he turned, but Ryouga was gone. He offered a small prayer that she  didn't find their real enemy, shrugged, and continued following Herb and Lime.</p><p>AN: I actually cut this chapter in half because with the  rest it was just too frickin' much story in one chapter. And yes, I am altering  this part from the manga storyline. There's too many differences and besides,  what's the point of just copying? (And no questioning why Horaisan wasn't one  the map.) Only two times when that is necessary, and this is the second…  anyway, love ya, enjoy the cliffhanger! ^_^ Ja!</p><p>~Mordain</p>
