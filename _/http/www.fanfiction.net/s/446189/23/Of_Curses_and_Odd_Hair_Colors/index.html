</div><p>Disclaimer:  I don't own Ranma ½. If you've heard otherwise, it's all  a dirty, dirty lie. As much as I'd <i>like</i> to be making money  off of this, sadly, I am not.</p><p>AN:  Faster than a lame snail, able to leap tall building if she takes the  elevator, Mordain presents: The next chapter!</p><p>Thank  you, everyone, for all the reviews. . I apologize for being such a  slowpoke… too many distractions lately…</p><p>Warnings:  Nothing worse than other chapters. Plot actually manages to continue  (or start to, at least). <i>I</i> was impressed, anyway.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><i><b>Part Three, Chapter Eight: And Flying</b></i><p>"Ranma?"</p><p>"Yeah?"  Ranma wasn't surprised, but he hadn't been expecting the address,  so he stopped in the hallway a little abruptly.</p><p>She  looked determined, so her next words were relatively predictable.  "I'm going with you."</p><p>"What  – Akane, you can't…"</p><p>"I'm  coming, I said!" she repeated, louder this time.</p><p>"We  don't even know where we're going…"</p><p>"I  don't care." She was confident now, looking at him with that  determined, stubborn expression that he knew he couldn't argue  with. "If… if I had been there the first time, maybe this  wouldn't be necessary! I've been training! I know you don't  like Herb, but… I think that I'm strong enough, now."</p><p>"Amusing."</p><p>They  both whirled at the unexpected interruption, but then they were  hardly talking in private so it should not have been so much of a  surprise.</p><p>Herb  looked steadily at Ranma, eyes flickering between anger and disgust  and apathy, before removing her gaze to Akane. "She's weak."  Akane winced. "She's human, there's no help for it. But-" and  now she looked back, piercingly, at Ranma- "I will not allow anyone  who has the capacity to affect the outcome of this to stay behind."</p><p>"But  if she gets hurt – it'll be my fault!"</p><p>"Ranma,  you idi-"</p><p>"No, it will not," Herb interrupted Akane  smoothly. "It is her decision to go. It will be her own  responsibility to keep herself, and others, alive. As well as yours,  and…" she grimaced, "my own."</p><p>Ranma  stared back at Herb, undaunted. "I won't lose. But Cologne didn't  even know what were would be facing – except that it would probably  be dangerous." He didn't look at Akane. "She should stay out of  my way, stay safe."</p><p>"<i>IDIOT!</i>"  Akane smacked him, hard, on the back of his head.</p><p>"Ouch!  Hey, what'd 'ya do that for?"</p><p>Akane  was fuming. "I won't get in the way! You be sure to stay out of  <i>my</i> way!"</p><p>Ranma  mentally stumbled, and instantly went from determined to 'what did  I do now' mode. "But-"</p><p>"I'd  advise you to allow her to go." Herb looked briefly over Ranma's  shoulder before turning and leaving the living room, presumably to go  back outside.</p><p>"I'm  coming," Akane said firmly, "and I'm not letting you stop me."</p><p>Ranma  was packing when he felt a presence approach him from behind. He  tensed; couldn't be too careful even in this relatively safe house,  lately. But it was just Nabiki.</p><p>"Hey,"  she greeted, smiling lazily at Ranma, and waving some sort of  envelope in the air. "Last chance for a purchase before you go."  Plucking a rectangle deftly out of the envelope, she waved it three  times before flipping it over the reveal what was imprinted on the  other side.</p><p>"A  picture of Akane!" It was tasteful, at least, just a simple  picture of her face that could have been a school photograph. "No  way!"</p><p>"Aw…  but maybe…" With a quick movement Nabiki had three more spread  out like playing cards, all facing her.</p><p>"What  the-"</p><p>She  revealed the first one. Akane, sitting on a bicycle in workout  clothing, smiled off to the left of the photographer. It was a nice  shot – even Ranma had to admit to himself that she looked good in  it - but not a revealing one, of course.</p><p>"When  did you-"</p><p>"No?"  Nabiki interrupted him, tucking it back into the envelope and  flipping over the next. "I've got more."</p><p>Ranma  looked away, face suddenly bright red. He hadn't seen it very  clearly, but the pink-haired girl in the photograph hadn't been  wearing much, if anything. Nabiki didn't have the same qualms about  guests as she did about relatives. "What the <i>hell</i>…!" he  shouted, really angry this time, before Nabiki cut him off again.</p><p>"There's  always this…" Ranma couldn't help it – he glanced. The new  picture had the same subject as the last – only with a distinctly  different build. But like the second picture of Akane, it was a  tasteful one, and obviously a candid shot – Ryouga was smiling, one  hand curling through black hair as he laughed.</p><p>Ranma's  anger ran cold. "What the hell…"</p><p>Nabiki  smirked before flipping it over and tucking all four pictures safely  in the envelope. "If you're not interested in a purchase, I'll  take my leave."</p><p>"What  are you-"</p><p>"If  you change your mind, you know where to find me," Nabiki opened to  the door. "Knowing the truth is important for me, especially when  it has to do with my family," she said, turning to leave. "It  might even be worth something to me…" the door finished swinging  closed, cutting off anything else she might have said.</p><p>Ranma  stared after her for a moment before growling under his breath and  resumed packing, angrily. <i>She was just guessing… after all,  she's got pictures of me, Ryouga is no different… </i>The thought  made him pause. <i>Wait… </i></p><p>Ryouga  was more surprised that Ranma let Akane come than she was. The  pink-haired girl gave Akane a long, worried look and then the moment  was over; there was little she could do about it. Akane was too  stubborn to be swayed.</p><p>Besides,  danger at the end of their trip was a distant and uncertain prospect,  while Herb was <i>right there</i> and not going anywhere. The two  girls-who-weren't seethed with hatred just being <i>near</i> the  other; this prospect of a long journey together was not an easy  prospect, and insufferable as she was Herb was better at hiding it.</p><p>Ryouga  almost yelped when she felt a hand land on her shoulder.</p><p>"Relax."  It was Ranma, and Ryouga found herself following the instruction  without really wanting too. As soon as she realized this she  stiffened, irritated.</p><p>"Don't  tell me you like that… that…"</p><p>Ranma  shrugged. "He's in the exact same situation as you are, and  you're both at fault." His face suddenly brightened like a light  bulb had been turned on over his head, and he laughed. "It's just  like you were with me!"</p><p>"No  it's not!"</p><p>"Yes,  it is-"</p><p>"Ranma?"</p><p>"Yeah,  Akane?"</p><p>"Are  you ready to go?"</p><p>"Uh,  sure." That felt backwards.</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Ryouga  stared after her as she turned and walked away. Something seemed…  different. As if Akane were distracted by something. Yet she must be  focused on the upcoming trip, or else she wouldn't have been able  to convince Ranma – and her family – to let her go in the first  place. Or maybe there was something else… it was slightly strange,  Ryouga realized, that she was so relaxed.</p><p>"Ryouga?"  Ranma looked at her oddly.</p><p>Ryouga  shook her head. "I'm fine." No point in dwelling on it.</p><p>"If  you say so." There was an uncomfortable pause. "We're taking a  boat," he went on, somewhat lamely.</p><p>"Better  than swimming, I guess," Ryouga shrugged, thinking. "How long do  you think it will take?"</p><p>"A  few hours on the boat, a week to get through China…"</p><p>"A  week." She frowned. A week with… her. Him. Herb, whatever pronoun  you wanted to use. The person, a genetic freak of nature, who had  turned <i>him</i> into… her… and opened the gate of what could  happen and what she desperately didn't <i>want</i> to happen.</p><p>"Yeah."  Ranma, if anything, looked confused about anything that could  possibly be the matter. "We've got a map of some train routes,  too… don't know where Nabiki got the money, but she said she  didn't want her sister walking if she was gonna insist on going."</p><p>"A  <i>train</i>." Ryouga didn't think that she could get much  angrier, but that managed it. "A whole… week… with…" A  quick glance revealed that Herb was nearby. Around the corner, but  easily within earshot if she let her voice rise to the levels that it  wanted to. "I'll walk." And with that, she turned on her heel  and stormed outside.</p><p>Ranma  moved to follow, hesitated, and then the moment was lost as a hand  fell on his shoulder.</p><p>"Don't  bother," Nabiki said smoothly. "He'll be back…" her voice  faded away as Ryouga slowly walked out of earshot, not nearly as  resolute now that she was out of sight.</p><p>She  didn't want to meet them, wanted to find her way into that  comfortable feeling of having absolutely no clue where she was, but  her feet made a different decision, and her mind knew what was best;  they looked slightly surprised to find her on the boat before them  but all she did was give a curt nod, note that Akane was walking up  first, and turn away.</p><p>Soun  cried, of course, as he saw them off. The other three were  considerably less emotional, although Kasumi fretted at her sister.</p><p>At  the last minute Genma jumped aboard the little boat, and was  immediately knocked back off by Ranma.</p><p>The  panda surfaced a moment later, holding up a sign. :What was that  for:</p><p>"What  makes you think you're coming, old man!" Ranma shouted back.</p><p>Genma  clambered back on to shore and shook himself dry (soaking Soun in the  process). He pulled out his marker and another sign and started to  write, marker squeaking furiously.</p><p>Ranma  waited.</p><p>And  waited.</p><p>And  waited.</p><p>His  patience ran out when the tenth sign joined the pile of reasons that  Genma had written. "Okay, okay!" he huffed.</p><p>Genma  jumped on board again, and smacked Ranma hard in the head. :Stupid  boy:</p><p>"Can we get going now?" Ryouga asked,  impatiently, from the other side of the deck. The Musk trio had  ducked inside.</p><p>Genma  threw a sign at her. :Anchors away:</p><p>Ryouga tossed it  back with perfect accuracy, beaning the panda squarely on the skull  and nearly making him topple back into the water. "Shut up, old  man!"</p><p>As  they vanished into the distance, Soun picked up the signs that Genma  had left behind.</p><p>And  sweatdropped.</p><p>Repeated several times on each one was the same,  short sentence.</p><p>:Because  you're going to Jusenkyou, you fool:</p><p>Nabiki  snorted, and flipped through her collection of pictures, wondering if  it would be profitable to take more. <i>Too bad Ranma didn't buy  anything…</i> she paused abruptly in her silent count. <i>Wait…  there's only four…</i> A quick run through of her mental  checklist later she grinned, realizing what was missing. Who had  managed to steal something from her was another matter, but it would  prove interesting either way.</p><p>It  was nice boat, at least, boasting a nice, reasonably sized deck for  watching the water and a few rooms below, to keep out of the sun. The  wind was a little stinging but otherwise pleasant, which was what  kept Akane above. That, and the rather crowded conditions inside at  the moment.</p><p>Ryouga  didn't seem to be talking to anyone, but Akane didn't really find  anything strange about this; after all, Herb was there and they quite  clearly didn't get along and had obvious reasons not to. The reason  that Ranma was worried (and hid it badly, as always) was less  obvious, but she let it go with all the other minor things she didn't  understand about Ranma.</p><p>Mint,  leaning up against the rail on the other side of the deck, looked  slightly green.</p><p>"Seasick?"  she called, shouting a little to be heard over the sound of the wind.  It was a nice day, too pleasant to lock herself below decks.</p><p>Mint  looked at her, startled, and shook his head silently no.</p><p>"Oh,  good…" She trailed off, her attempt at conversation having fallen  flat.</p><p>Herb  chose that moment to appear from below, tri-colored hair billowing  dramatically. Then the wind changed and it went in her eyes, ruining  the effect until she managed to bring it under control.</p><p>Mint  bristled to attention, although he didn't stand. It was  disturbingly like a dog suddenly sitting neatly on its haunches when  its master entered the room.</p><p>Herb  looked at Akane, however, rather than the wolf-boy. "Training,"  she said simply, and Akane jumped to her feet, knowing that she  wasn't behaving much better than Mint but unable to help herself.</p><p>"Good.  I was getting bored," she answered, trying to cover instinctive  obedience.</p><p>Herb  just nodded, but for a brief moment Akane thought she saw the corners  of the prince's mouth rise; then it was gone, and such untactical  observations were a crucial waste of attention.</p><p>Ten  minutes later Akane, with a loud yell, went flying overboard. The  two-member crew of the little boat went ballistic for a few moments,  throwing everything into chaos, until Lime appeared out of nowhere,  dove smoothly into the water, and climbed back up the side of the  boat a minute later, carrying a soaked and irritated, but unharmed,  Akane over his shoulder.</p><p>"Akane!"  Ranma appeared at the top of the stairs. "Herb, you bas-"</p><p>"Ranma!"  Akane shouted back to get his attention. "It's alright." Lime  set her gently down on the deck and stepped away quickly, flushing  belatedly. "I'm fine. We were just training, that's all."</p><p>"Training?"  he was conflicted over that one, she could tell. For Ranma, it was  never a bad time to train.</p><p>"Yes.  And I'm fine." She smiled thankfully up at Lime, who stuttered  back, unable to respond coherently to a female.</p><p>A  pink head of hair peered up from the stairwell, just enough to  briefly scan the scene, but Ryouga just vanished a moment after  appearing.</p><p>Ranma  hadn't noticed. "Well, okay…" he turned his gaze, peering  westward. "We're almost there anyway…"</p><p>He  was pointedly not looking at Herb. Maybe he <i>did</i> know that  Ryouga was right behind him, Akane mused. She shook her head. No  point in worrying about him.</p><p>She  turned back to Herb. "I'm ready."</p><p>The  prince nodded. "Very well."</p><p>"Wait,  you're-" Ranma cut himself off when he realized that no one was  paying him the slightest bit of attention.</p><p>Akane  did notice, however, that he settled himself into a corner of the  deck – opposite Mint and the drenched Lime – and watched them,  silently. She ignored him after that, all concentration focused on  her opponent.</p><p>Ryouga  leaned into the corner, pressing her eyes into her arm. Not crying,  just… aggravated. Tense. Confined. This didn't <i>suit</i> her,  stuck in one place; as much as she had hated always getting lost she  had molded her entire life around it. Staying meant dealing with  things, and she didn't know <i>how</i>.</p><p>Feelings.  She hated the world. So much easier just to love Akane and have an  excuse for not telling her; so much more difficult to find… well,  not love, but something else with Ranma and spend so much time around  him that staying quiet was impossible. There was no silent wilderness  to confess to anymore. It was small consolation that Ranma didn't  seem to know what to do any better than Ryouga did, but at least <i>he</i>  was acting normally, speaking without thinking and saying things that  he couldn't <i>possibly</i> know the meaning of.</p><p>The  boat suddenly started to rock, gently at first and then wildly, until  suddenly coming to a loud, jarring halt.</p><p>They  must have arrived. A crewmember came down a moment later and informed  her of as much; she followed him out.</p><p>They were in the country quite illegally but it  didn't seem to matter, and it was hardly the first time for all but  one of them. They had arrived in a small town a long distance from  anywhere of any importance, and it was simple matter from there to  find the next train in the general direction of where they wanted to  go.</p><p>Herb seemed impatient, but he was the one who knew  where they were going. After all that time, the fact that Cologne had  only been able to tell them to go to Jusenkyou was a little  frustrating.</p><p>'<i>The council of Jusenkyou are a secretive  people,'</i> Cologne's words echoed in Ranma's memory, '<i>but  you must convince them to share their knowledge. There is a place  called Jusendo, where the great underground source of water is  channeled to the surface. The cold is the source of the cursed  springs, but the hot has different magic. You must find the hot water  and reforge the kettle in its heat – this is the only way to  restore the magic. The Jusenkyou guide should have the knowledge of  how to find the hot water. However, Jusendo is in the territory of a  vicious tribe, who will not allow you entrance so easily…'</i></p><p>Ranma sighed, not for the first time, and glanced  out of the corner of his eyes at Ryouga, who was visibly fidgeting.</p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p>"Nothing, and stop asking, Saotome…" Ryouga  leaned up against the wall, turning away.</p><p>"What's gotten <i>into</i> you, Hibiki?"  Ranma said irritably.</p><p>He couldn't see Ryouga's face, but the sheer  <i>force</i> of her glare reflected off the wall of the empty freight  car – of course it hadn't been a <i>passenger</i> train going to  such a remote place – and hit him squarely between the eyes. "Shut  up, Ranma. You're so cheerful it's aggravating."</p><p>"Cheerful…" Ranma chuckled, weakly. "Well,  yeah, I mean we're going to Jusenkyou…"</p><p>"So you can be a full man again," Ryouga  finished quietly.</p><p>"Oh." Ranma's face dropped briefly, than  brightened. "Well, once we get the kettle fixed, you can too-"</p><p>The door flew open, suddenly, and a rather  wind-lashed Akane stumbled in, barely avoiding her heel being smacked  by the door as it swung closed behind her. She nodded absently to the  two of them and slumped to the floor, obviously exhausted but,  judging from the fragment of a smile on her face, content as well.  Ranma immediately cut off.</p><p>"Akane?"</p><p>She looked up at him, tiredly, and grinned. "Yeah…  Ranma?" she answered, short of breath.</p><p>"You shouldn't go on to the roof, Akane,"  Ryouga told her, her tone slipping into worried.</p><p>Akane just smiled again. "But the view…  it's gorgeous!" She was clearly undeterred. "And the balance  practice… that's good too." She seemed to have finally caught  her breath, and spoke eagerly. "There's no windows in this train,  and it's stuffy," she suddenly complained. "Waste of  countryside."</p><p>Neither of the other two managed to respond to  that. It was pretty scenery, they both knew, but one could hate even  beauty if forced to walk through it for weeks on end…</p><p>"Why did you come down?" Ryouga asked  awkwardly, trying to make conversation.</p><p>"Tired," Akane answered simply after a moment.  "And it's almost dark, anyway."</p><p>(earlier)</p><p>Herb touched down, delicately, on the roof of  the engine, and was immediately forced to grab onto the railing as  the train threatened to knock her off as easily as a leaf. She spent  a moment catching her breath – as fast as she was in the air, the  train was only slightly slower than her fastest sprint and, as a  mechanical device, untiring.</p><p>"Herb-sensei?" Akane had been sitting on the  edge of the roof, watching the scenery go by. She pulled herself to  her feet and offered a hand to help Herb regain her balance, but Herb  just shook her head, not needing it anymore.</p><p>Akane just bowed, slightly, retracting her hand,  and didn't sit back down. She did, however, return her gaze to the  passing countryside.</p><p>Herb wished that she knew what the Japanese girl  wanted. Training, yes, it was clear that the girl had a desire to  become stronger that would have served her admirably as a prospective  warrior of the Musk tribe; but there was something else as well.</p><p>As much as she had tried avoiding discussion of  things that didn't concern her – and little did other than the  quest for the Kaisufuu – it seemed to be impossible for one to be  among the inhabitants of Nerima and <i>not</i> hear about the soap  opera of the Tendo household. The general consensus seemed to be that  there was an attachment between the two engaged, whether they  admitted to it or not. Herb was above concerning herself with such  adolescent pettiness – besides, she was hardly an expert on the  female mind, having barely even met one until shortly before <i>becoming</i>  one – but she found herself taking an interest in training Akane,  despite her initial reluctance to teach her. <i>She has a strong  strength of will,</i> Herb thought approvingly. <i>And true talent.  Perhaps not entirely worthy of my teaching, but not completely  undeserving, either.</i></p><p>"It's a beautiful country," Akane said  suddenly.</p><p>Herb blinked, startled out of her thoughts, and  glanced at her student before scanning their surroundings. "Yes,"  she agreed vaguely.</p><p>"Can you see where we're going, from the sky?"</p><p>"Not yet." How small did the girl think China  was? <i>For that matter, why is she so enthralled by the scenery?  It's just land.</i> "We are still several days away."</p><p>"Oh." Akane didn't look disappointed,  although from her answer it seemed that she should have.</p><p>They stood in silence for another few minutes,  Herb feeling steadily more uncomfortable and clueless as to why,  until the sun was in the midst of setting in a brilliant burst of  orange and gold.</p><p>"I'm going inside," Herb announced once it  was clear that dusk had fallen.</p><p>Akane jumped. "Al-alright," she agreed.  "Herb-sensei."</p><p>"I wouldn't advise falling asleep up here."  Before Akane could answer, Herb jumped down between the nearest two  cars. Whatever answer her student offered, she didn't hear it  between the noise of the train, the wind, and the door slamming  firmly closed between her and the outside.</p><p>Once fully inside, she scanned the room. There  were only two empty cars on the train, and they had been split  between the Musk and the Japanese.</p><p>Mint and Lime were asleep – so much for guard  duty – but she decided to be generous and not wake them up.  Besides, there wasn't much for them to guard and fewer prospective  thieves.</p><p>She clearly underestimated Mint's sense of  smell, however, because no sooner had she settled herself against the  opposite wall than the wolf-boy stirred, nose twitching before the  rest of him.</p><p>"Herb-sama?" he questioned, rubbing the sleep  out of blurry eyes.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>He let out a high-pitched yelp  of surprise and kicked Lime, who woke up with a similar sound of  surprise and annoyance. "Please forgive us, Herb-sama!" Mint  shouted, bowing low to the floor.</p><p>Herb waved him off "Never mind. You should rest.  I am not very worried."</p><p>"Thank you, Herb-sama…"</p><p>Belatedly, Lime realized what was going on and  managed to look contrite.</p><p>Herb laid down. "But since you are awake, now, I  expect you not to fall asleep again as I rest." Before either of  them could answer, she turned to face the wall and was still.</p><p>If she hadn't have known that he trip would be  so long, Herb would never have indulged in as much flying as she had.  Without wings, defying gravity was merely a matter of expending  enough energy to convince it to ignore her, and generally it wasn't  a good idea to expend her reserves. Especially since she had been  stuck female, which bottlenecked her power in a highly aggravating  manner – not that she had informed her tenuous allies of this fact.</p><p>The floor was hard and unyieldingly flat,  impossible to really get comfortable, but within seconds of lying  down a sleep that was more like unconsciousness – restorative, but  restless – drew her down, washing over the discomfiting feeling  that nagged at her to stay awake and knocking her asleep</p><p>Akane, for all her enthusiasm and excitement, was  not used to traveling. She dropped off to sleep shortly after coming  down from the roof and was soon snoring away merrily in a corner.</p><p>Ranma sighed in her general direction, tilting his  head back against the wall to stare straight up at the ceiling. "Is  she always like that?" he asked Ryouga, who was similarly  sleepless.</p><p>"Not always," the cursed girl admitted slowly,  with a distinct tone of embarrassment in her voice.</p><p>The only noise after that was the soft shuffle of  playing cards being fiddled with. Ryouga was restless after all.</p><p>"Do you want to play something?" Ranma  offered, voice neutral. They had tried to play before, but the sheer  length of the train ride had defeated that plan when Ryouga grew  frustrated with her losing streak. And they didn't know enough  games between the two of them to keep interest in it.</p><p>"I guess. But not old maid." Ryouga answered  at length, grudgingly.</p><p>"Go fish?"</p><p>"Poker?"</p><p>The list of suggestions went on, but Ryouga  dismissed them all. It was a good thing, in most cases, because  rather quickly Ranma started listing games that he didn't know how  to play, and then ones that he was pretty sure he was making up.</p><p>"War?"</p><p>"N-" Ryouga stopped in her automatic denial,  thought for a second, and then shrugged. "Sure."</p><p>The game was something to do, at least, but it  wasn't terribly exciting. Ryouga couldn't even manage to stay  enthusiastic about her steady lead, and could feel exhaustion  creeping up on her. Damn it, if only the cards could shuffle  themselves into the right order so she could win…</p><p>"It's better than walking," Ranma said as he  picked up his win – a nine to a ten, smug bastard – and tossed  them on his pile, "but I kinda <i>liked</i> traveling myself."</p><p>"You'll get your chance," Ryouga shrugged,  tossing out the new card and taking her pair with a half-hearted  grin. "The tracks don't go all the way to Jusenkyou."</p><p>"If they did I would've done this a year ago,"  Ranma agreed. "Of course, Nabiki wouldn't have paid for them a  year ago…"</p><p>"I hope this isn't all for nothing," Ryouga  said irritably, wanting to distract herself from the reminder that  the springs were useless to her. "Cologne makes us wait more than a  week and all she says is to go to Jusenkyou…"</p><p>"Yeah, she is being too nice," Ranma agreed,  misunderstanding. "I wonder why…"</p><p>Ryouga didn't answer, paying more attention to  the next few plays than the game really deserved. Ranma waited, but  she was quite clearly not going to volunteer anything.</p><p>"Do you know why?" he eventually prompted.  "You seemed to, back there…"</p><p>"I don't know," she answered quietly. "But  I could feel something… when we went to see what Cologne'd found  out, Shampoo…" she shuddered. "I think she <i>hated</i> me."</p><p>"Hated you?" Ranma won the next play but  almost missed it. "Why would she… the only person she really  doesn't like is Akane, but that's because…" his eyes widened.  "Oh. But… how would they know that?" he asked, confused. "I  mean, even you don't <i>really</i> know…"</p><p>"Idiot."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You're an idiot." Ryouga was careful to  speak quietly, barely loud enough for Ranma to hear – but that was  too loud, with Akane so nearby. "Everything you're doing. So  stupid."</p><p>"But-"</p><p>"I don't deserve the sympathy you give me,"  she said quietly. "Why are you so nice to me? Why did you save my  life when I wanted you to end it? It's not fair."</p><p>Ranma didn't say anything. Ryouga glanced up,  but his expression was just that of patient listening mixed equally  with clueless.</p><p>"It's all your fault." She cut herself off,  glancing at Akane – who was still just peacefully sleeping, thank  goodness – and tossed her cards to the floor. "I'm tired.  Goodnight."</p><p>And with that, she lay down, pulling her pillow  over and curling on her side, facing away from Ranma to stare at the  wall, feeling blank and lost even though she knew precisely where she  was.</p><p>"When I was stuck as a girl," Ranma said  suddenly, "I hated it. Would've done anything to be myself again,  anything but love someone I couldn't trust. I stuck my hands in  fire instead, trying to be rid of it. But you don't have that  option, but you're one of my oldest friends…" He came to an  awkward stop, leaving Ryouga confused as to what his point was. With  a snap the light went off, and she heard him settling down to rest on  the floor.</p><p>"I trust you."</p><p>-Mordain</p><p>AN: Adieu!</p>
