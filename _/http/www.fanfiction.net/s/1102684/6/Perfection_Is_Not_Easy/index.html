</div>                Disclaimer:  Ranma ½ was created by Rumiko Takahashi.  I had nothing to do with it.  Please do not sue me; all money that I have  goes directly to liquor…err, I mean comics and such.<p>Warning: Dark Scenes ahead!</p><p>A little over two months ago…</p><p>Shampoo had not been prepared  for an attack on the village and she cursed herself for that.  A true warrior was always ready for combat no  matter what the situation.  However she  had been busy in the northern forest doing last minute training for the  tournament that was to be held in two days.   The fact was that no one was prepared, but that did nothing to help  Shampoo's guilt.  To the girl's horror  she heard loud explosions coming from the village.  Upon reaching her home the purple haired amazon  found many houses on fire and corpses spread throughout the village.  It was a horrible site.  It was like the whole world was burning.</p><p>"What force could have done  all this," Shampoo wondered.  It couldn't  have been the Musk; they didn't have the forces to mount a full scale assault  on the amazons.  But if it wasn't their  hated foe then who could it have been?</p><p>The sounds of a battle  snapped Shampoo from her current train of thought.  The Amazon raced toward the scene where the  noise was coming from only to find a single hooded cloaked figure standing over  a terrified little girl.  The unknown  warrior placed his hand above the girl's head.</p><p>"Death to all amazons," was  all he said as a ki blast erupted from his palm, incinerating the helpless girl  right before Shampoo's eyes.</p><p>The Amazon was in shock when  she saw her "little sister" die such a tragic and pointless death.  Enraged, Shampoo charged at the murderer,  ignoring the fact that she had never seen such incredible power before.  She lashed out with a barrage of kicks and punches,  but the mysterious fighter was able to block them all with ease.  Beneath his cloak he smiled.  With one devastating kick, the cloaked  fighter sent his opponent painfully to the ground.</p><p>Shampoo had never been hit  this hard.  The single blow had given her  several internal injuries.  The amazon  was coughing up blood. Before she had a chance to retaliate at all she suddenly  found the cloaked murderer's foot on top of her throat.</p><p>"I can't believe that was  all you had" the cloaked man spoke in perfect Chinese.  "You damn amazons are not only  dishonorable, but pathetically weak as well."</p><p>Normally Shampoo would have  become insanely angry when an outsider insulted her people, but the voice of  her opponent was so familiar…  She told  herself it couldn't be him, the kind boy she had met a few months earlier.  The voice was far too cold, and his methods  far too brutal.</p><p>But when the outsider removed  his hood there was no denying it: This man was Ranma Saotome.</p><p>Ranma smirked evilly and spat  at his downed foe.  "I couldn't find  the bitch that killed my mother here today.   I guess you and your sisters will have to do."</p><p>Shampoo was utterly  confused.  The Ranma she knew would never  attack the Amazon Nation.  In fact he  couldn't; he wasn't nearly strong enough.   Even if he wanted revenge against the one who killed his mother Shampoo  had told him before that the one who had done the deed was a fallen Amazon and  was no longer welcomed in the village for other reasons.  Most disturbingly of all: this guy attacked  as if he didn't recognize her.</p><p>Just before Ranma made the  killing blow Shampoo looked at his eyes and suddenly realized the truth.  Sadly it was far too late.</p><p>After a few hours later Ranma  left the village, having killed all but a few of its inhabitants.  As he slowly walked away he smiled once  again.</p><p>"Was that okay, Tenma?"</p><p><b>Chapter 6</b></p><p><b>Memory</b></p><p>It was morning at the Tendo  household.  It had been two days since Nabiki  had been kidnapped by the bounty hunter ninja who called himself "Sin".   Ranma easily dispatched of the kidnapper but  was unprepared by the arrival of his old enemy Emily Tisdale.  The pony tailed boy was almost killed, saved  only by the interference of Ryoga as well as another Jusenkyo cursed martial  artist who was referred to as "Pantyhose Taro."</p><p>The house had been filled  with turmoil over the whole situation.   Questions about Ranma were being brought up, mainly by Soun who up until  this point had seemingly not been too worried about the boy's past. But now  things were different as the skeletons in the pony tailed martial artist's  closet had broken out and were now threatening the Tendo family.</p><p>Interrogations would have to  wait, however, as Ranma needed a few days to recover from the fight.  The Chinese clothes clad youth opted to stay  home from school during this time, not to mention having to wait a while before  starting his new part time job.  Dr. Tofu  didn't mind of course.  He told the young  fighter that he could start whenever he felt he was healthy enough to do so.</p><p>Three days past.  Ranma spent much of this time in his room  recovering.  By the third day he felt  like he was ready to get back into his training.  He spent most of the day in the dojo.  It was only when Kasumi asked him to come to  the dining room for tea that he stopped.   Waiting for him there were Mr. Tendo and Genma.  The pony tailed boy quietly sat at the table  with them, knowing full well what would happen next.</p><p>There would still be a few  hours before Nabiki and Akane would return from school while Ryoga hadn't been  seen since the night of the battle.  So  until Kasumi returned from the kitchen with the tea it was just Ranma and the  old men.</p><p>Genma's face was hard, as was  Soun's. "You've got some explaining to do, boy," his father exclaimed.</p><p>Soun nodded.  "Who exactly was that…girl who attacked  you?  Why in the world do you have a  bounty on your head?"</p><p>Ranma sighed.  He had tried to keep as much of his past a  mystery as possible since he didn't think he'd be staying long.  Sadly he had no choice.  "Alright Pop…Mr. Tendo…I'll tell you about  it.  All of it."</p><p>Only Ranma noticed Kasumi  poking her head out of the kitchen in order to better hear the explanation.</p><p>"I'll you about that Emily  chick first.  It all started about three  years ago…"</p><p>Nodoka returned to the  current apartment that the Saotome's were renting late that day.  It was well past dinner time which left Genma  annoyed.  When she returned she had a  worried expression on her face.  A  thirteen year old Ranma starred from across the room.  He noticed his mother was Ryoga-less which  could only mean that his friend had once again wandered off and gotten  lost.  This didn't happen too often since  both the Saotome parents kept a close eye on the young boy.</p><p>Genma wasn't happy once he  realized what had happen.  "Damn that brat!  He's always getting lost somewhere and I'm  always the one who has to go find him!   Well I've had it!  He can go fall  of a cliff for all I care.  I've wasted  valuable training time on him that could have been used for Ranma!"</p><p>The pony tailed boy in question  gasped at his father's statement.  As  those words passed through the old man's lips Ranma began losing what little  respect he had for him.</p><p>Nodoka was outraged.  "How can you say that?  I know Ryoga is a handful but he's as much a  member of this family as any of us.  If  you won't go looking for him then I shall!"</p><p>To this the fat, glasses  wearing martial artist frowned.  "I'm not  going to let you go out alone.  You know  how much ground that kid can cover when he's lost!"</p><p>The two argued for a good  long while.  Finally, after becoming fed  up with the two their young son yelled out "I'll go find him!"</p><p>Both his parents looked at  him like he had lost mind.  To which  Ranma replied "Look, Pop doesn't want to do it, right?  So why not me?"</p><p>Genma shook his head.  "That's crazy talk, boy."  But then he thought about it.  Ranma going looking for him meant he didn't  have to do it.  Also it would be good  tracking training for the boy.  Plus  while he was gone he could get a well deserved break from their training.  The fat fighter turned to his wife.  "Nodoka, I insist that Ranma go out looking  for Ryoga.  It'll be good training."</p><p>This resulted in another  argument, but in the end Nodoka agreed.   Ranma was allowed to go looking for Ryoga alone. The pony tailed boy  left as soon as he could pack what few belongings he had.</p><p>The search for Ryoga was, in  Ranma's opinion, the single most trying experience in his life.  He thought that he would just be searching  around the Osaka area (Which was where they currently lived) but  instead Ryoga led Ranma on a fantastic world tour!  For six months the pony tailed boy tracked  his friend.  He saw and visited several  countries along the way and had many adventures.</p><p>Finally Ranma was able to  catch up to the elusive Ryoga in England of all places.</p><p>The Saotome Heir picked up  Ryoga's trail in a very small village.   There was nothing interesting about it at all except that there had been  a string of murders the past few months.   Several young men, all who possessed some sort of fighting ability, were  found brutally murdered in the streets.   To add to the already questionable circumstances all the killings happen  to take place on full moons.</p><p>Ranma didn't believe in  werewolves at all and figured that some crazy person was going around slicing  people up with some sort of weird horror movie fetish.  The pony tailed boy was a bit cautious  though, as fighters were being targeted.   There was a chance, albeit a small one, that Ryoga had been a victim  after roaming through the town.  Then  there's also the possibility that the Saotome Heir was next.</p><p>After asking around the  village he learned that a young Asian boy, around thirteen or fourteen, had  come around about two days ago asking where Osaka was.  All signs  pointed to Ryoga.  Unfortunately no one  had seen him since then, which meant he may have wandered off.  The morgue had told the Ranma that no one by  that description (or anyone else lately for that matter) had been found dead in  the matter the serial murders had been taking place.</p><p>After a full day of detective  work the pony tailed youth decided that it was time to turn in for the  night.  He opted to camp just outside of  town and hopefully he would resume his search in the morning.</p><p>The sound of nearby foot  steps forced Ranma awake.  Someone was wandering  around the outside of his tent.   Carefully Ranma poked his head outside.   All he saw was some old middle aged guy leaning against a nearby tree  smoking a cigarette.  "Hello, nice  night, isn't it," he said to the pony tailed boy in English.</p><p>"Umm, yeah, I guess  so," Ranma replied.  His English was  pretty good, as his mother had forced him, as well as Ryoga, to study the  basics of many languages.  Being a quick  learner he had been able to learn to speak decent English, Chinese and German  during this little six month trip.   "Hey, mind telling me what you're doing hanging around my tent?"</p><p>The old guy just smiled.  "You're a fighter, right?  Of course you are; I already know that you  are.  I can tell by the way you carried  yourself around town today.  I'd say you  pretty bloody good."</p><p>The wheels in Ranma's head  began turning quickly.  "You're the  guy who's been slicing up fighters!"</p><p>The man tossed his cigarette  away, giving the Saotome Heir a wink.   "I must say, a brilliant use of deduction considering we've only  talked a short while.  But yes, you are  correct.  I'm guilty as charged."</p><p>Hearing that Ranma came out  of his tent completely, not caring that he was only clad in his boxers.  "I guess you want to fight me too,  huh?"</p><p>The man simply nodded.  "Most of those other fellows weren't true  warriors, so I ended their lives.  Let's  see if you're any better."</p><p>The pony tailed martial  artist, showing any signs of fear, went into a defensive stance.  Without moving the man continued.  "The moon is beautiful tonight, isn't it?"  It wasn't until then Ranma noticed the full moon high in the sky behind this  mysterious challenger.  "I've yet to  look at it this night.  Would you mind if  I took a peek?"</p><p>With that the man turned  around and took a nice long look at the bountiful sphere.  Then the transformation took place.  He grew only slightly larger, thus he  remained in the suit he wore, but he still became covered in brown fur and his  had took the shape of a vicious looking wolf.   Ranma could barley believe what he saw; it was true, the killer really  was werewolf!</p><p>The creature launched himself  at the young fighter, but surprisingly it wasn't nearly as fast as he was  expecting.  Ranma was easily able to  dodge the attacks of the vicious looking werewolf.</p><p>This went on for a while  until the wolf-man finally began to grow weary.   Sensing the opening Ranma punched the monster with all his might in the  stomach.  This caused his to fall to his  knees, clenching his gut.</p><p>"Alright, alright, I  surrender," The wolf said to his former opponent.  "Damn, I can't believe you are as strong  as that other kid."</p><p>This caused Ranma to suddenly  become emotional.  "Other kid?"</p><p>The wolf nodded.  "Yes, the bloke you were asking about in  town today. I know him.  I fought him  about two days ago.  He beat me just as  quickly as you did.  Your styles are  similar, I believe."</p><p>"So you know Ryoga?  Where the hell is he?"</p><p>The werewolf suddenly turned  back into his human form.  "I'll take you  to him and explain on the way," he responded in perfect Japanese.</p><p>After dressing himself, Ranma  followed the stranger in the hopes he could finally find his lost friend</p><p>It turned out that this man  was the head of a family of werewolves which he descried as the most powerful,  wealthy and important clan in England.  It seemed  that it was getting close to the time his daughter, the heir the family fortune  and next leader of the clan, was to go through the marriage ritual.  Accordance to the old customs though she  would have to marry a human who was strong enough to defeat the current leader  (The groom would be changed into one of them by the bride on the  honeymoon).  This would ensure that the  bloodline would always be kept strong.   Thus Theodore Tisdale, as the stranger would introduce himself as to  Ranma, had for the past few months attacked anyone with fighting ability that  happened to pass through this little town.   If he was defeated then that young man would be taken back to their  mansion and engaged to his beloved daughter.</p><p>When Ranma asked if Ryoga had  consented to this rather bizarre ritual all Theodore could say was that "He  just had some pre-marital gitters.  I  expect he'll change his tune once he's lived with Emily a bit.  She's quite beautiful, after all.  Well mannered and kind.  A little, err, eccentric, but otherwise a  real catch."</p><p>"Here's what I don't get,"  Ranma said as the two neared a huge mansion upon a rather large hill.  "Why the hell are you still attacking  fighters if you already found a guy for your kid to marry?"</p><p>Theodore looked a little  embarrassed when Ranma asked that.   "Well, ahem, when one engages in activities for a long while he gains a  certain fancy for it…"</p><p>The pony tailed young just  shook his head.  He knew what the old man  was implying: He had become addicted to killing fighters foolish enough to  stroll through the sleepy town.  Ranma  knew for a fact that there was no way Ryoga would want to marry into such a  family on his own accord.  Above all else  the lost boy hated people picking on the weak and it seemed this was what this  clan was all about.</p><p>Upon reaching the front doors  Ranma noticed two young men standing on each side of the front door.  Theodore explained that Ranma was a friend of  the "groom" and should be treated with respect while he stayed there.</p><p>"Well, can I see Ryoga now or  what?"  Ranma demanded, passing up the  opportunity to take the grand tour of the house.</p><p>The old wolf sighed sadly, as  hoped to show his new friend just how rich and powerful he really was.  "Alright, I'll take you to him.  A pity really, I so wanted to show you the  library.  Oh well, I'd say there'll be plenty  of time for that later.  Follow me, my  boy."</p><p>And thus the head of this odd  family lead Ranma to the back of the mansion.   There was a door that, like the front, was guarded; this time by a  mountain of a man.  He had no hair on his  head and seemed to enjoy not wearing a shirt so he could show off his muscles.</p><p>"Out the way, Cyrus,"  Theodore demanded when the large man did not initially clear the doorway.  "I'm taking this boy to see Ryoga."</p><p>The Cyrus person seemed a bit  torn.  "Well, the thing is Master  Tisdale is, well, your daughter Emily gave strict instructions not to let  anyone pass."</p><p>This made Theodore raise an  eyebrow.  "What?  I say, that does sound like something Emily  would do.  Perhaps giving your friend a  bit of a preview of what married life will be for them, eh Ranma?" He  nudged the pony tailed boy as he said this.</p><p>Ranma said nothing, as he  decided to pretend he couldn't understand English at this point.</p><p>The head of the Tisdale  household looked directly in Cyrus' eyes.   "Look here Cyrus, I'm afraid that Emily doesn't have higher  authority than myself, so I must insist that you move.  Otherwise I'll have to rip of you head, drain  your skull, and use it as a wine bottle."</p><p>Cyrus moved out of way.</p><p>What was behind the door was a  stair case that led into what was nothing more than a dungeon.  Ranma asked why Ryoga was staying in here of  all places.</p><p>"Dungeon?  Don't be  silly, my dear boy.  This is Emily's  room."</p><p>This was Ranma's first clue  of the mental state of this "Emily" person.   Despite the claims that this was a room it certainly looked like a  dungeon.  Actually it was more of a  torture chamber as several questionable devises could be found in there.  Dank, dark, rats running around, no light  except for the torches on the wall, Ryoga chained to said  wall…wait, what?</p><p>Indeed, Ryoga Hibiki was  chained against one of the walls of the so-called room.  He was sporting a black eye and his clothes  were a bit torn, but he was otherwise fine as far as Ranma could tell.  The lost boy seemed to be asleep.</p><p>Ranma, shocked at this, raced  toward his friend.  "Ryoga!  Wake up!   C'mon man, wake up."  After slapping  him around a few times the lost boy came around.</p><p>When he realized who it was  standing in front of him, Ryoga began crying tears of joy.  "Oh, thank God it's you Ranma!  I thought I was doomed!"</p><p>Ranma turned toward  Theodore.   "What the hell is this,  huh?  I'd say he's not jumping for joy at  the thought of marrying your daughter!"</p><p>The old man was a bit puzzled  as well.  "Hmm, yes, this is a bit  strange.  She told me he was quite  comfortable in here.  I truthfully  haven't seen him since I first brought him to the manor.  I thought what they needed was some time  alone."</p><p>This caused Ryoga to  explode.  "You idiot!  Because of you I've seen hell!  That psycho you call a daughter thought it be  fun to beat the resistance out of me so I could become a nice docile  husband.  She even said that if by  tonight I still wasn't gung ho about getting married she'd dominate me in fun  and interesting ways!  I don't know what  she meant by that but it sounded painful!"</p><p>Theodore looked down at the  floor as it had seemed suddenly interesting.   "Well, ahem, don't look at me.   Got that from her mother, I expect."</p><p>The pony tailed boy had had it.  "Listen up, old man: I don't care what you  thought was going happen but it's obvious that your kid is a nutcase and Ryoga  doesn't wanna marry her.  So we can do  this one of two ways: You can let us walk out of here nice and easy or we can  pretend that that I'm a vet and it's time for all bad doggies to get neutered!"</p><p>Theodore, by all means, was  not an idiot and could tell when he was outmatched.  "I see.   Then you feel the same way, Ryoga?'</p><p>"DAMN STRAIGHT I DO!" was  the lost boy's response.</p><p>The old man sighed.  "Oh well. I don't see the point in trying to  force things.  You're free to go,  boys.  Let help you down, Ryoga."</p><p>A few minutes they all found  themselves outside Emily's room, standing next to the guard Cyrus who had a  troubled look on his face.</p><p>"Well, lads," Theodore said  cheerfully, as though none of what had happened that night was any sort of big  deal.  "Parting is such sweet sorrow. If  either of you happen to find yourselves in England again feel free to drop by.  We can have a cup of tea in my own private  personal library."  He looked  particularly pleased about the fact that he did indeed own his own library.</p><p>"Umm, sure," Ranma lied as  both he and Ryoga never to set eyes on another member of this family for as  long as they lived.</p><p>There was a pause of awkward  silence.  After a while Theodore cleared  his throat as if indicating he wanted the boys to say something.  When they shrugged their shoulders the werewolf  leader rolled his eyes at their ungentlemanly behavior.  "Weren't you raised were proper manners?  When I invite you to come back for a visit  you should do the same for me.  I'm not  sure why I'd ever be so bold as to visit Japan, but if I were I'd like to think I'd be able to stay  with my new oriental friends, don't you think?"</p><p>Ranma again rolled his  eyes.  "Sure,  whatever."</p><p>They said there goodbyes and  the two martial artists were just about to walk away when Theodore again  grabbed their attention.  "Oh, I forgot  to mention that my dear daughter Emily hates to loose.  I doubt she'll give up on you as easily as I  have, Ryoga.  If I were you I'd get as  far from England as possible and be extremely aware of the lunar  cycle."</p><p>Ranma gave him a cocky  smirk.  He had beaten Theodore with  little effort and he was supposed to be the head of the clan.  The pony tailed youth certainly didn't fear  some little girl werewolf.</p><p>The two friends quickly made their  way out of the mansion, however they sadly did not get very far until the sound  of someone running filled the night air.   They turned around to find, much to Ranma's annoyance (and Ryoga's  fear), a girl standing behind them.  With  long blonde hair, beautiful looks and an expensive dress this girl could only  be the elusive Emily.</p><p>She was breathing heavily as  she was forced to run in order to catch up to them.  Once she caught her breath she asked "Ryoga,  dear, why have you strayed from our home?   And who is this ruff looking Asian whom is accompanying you?  A new servant"</p><p>This comment got to  Ranma.  "Hey, watch your mouth!"</p><p>The blond didn't to hear  him.  Her attention was solely on the  lost boy.  "Ryoga, come we should really  head back home.  There's still so much  for us to do as a young engaged couple."</p><p>The bandana clad youngster  lost his temper at this.  "Listen Emily,  for the last time I'm not going to marry you!   Can't you get that through your demented head?"</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma added.  "I mean, you can't force someone to love you,  so why bother?"</p><p>Emily's cold eyes were not  starring directly at the Saotome heir.   It sent chills down his spine for some reason.  "So," Emily said, her voice like ice.  "You are the one who has poisoned my lover's  mind with thoughts of betrayal and desertion."</p><p>Ranma gulped, not knowing  what to say.</p><p>"Fine," she continued.  "It seems before I can embrace love's sweet  kiss I must deal with you first.  Very  well, I shall!  Be thankful that I have  allowed you die with such a beautiful moon in the sky!"</p><p>And with that, Emily Tisdale eyed  above their heads and looked straight into the large moon in the sky.  The same transformation as with Theodore took  place.  However this time the werewolf  standing before them was much, much larger and looked far more vicious and  bloodthirsty.</p><p>All Ranma could say to this  was "Oh shit."</p><p>Ranma stopped at this point,  leaving Soun, Genma and Kasumi shocked and in disbelief.</p><p>"What happened after that,  Ranma?" Kasumi asked.  During Ranma's  tale she had become too involved and had actually come to sit with them at the  table.</p><p>Ranma shrugged.  "She was too strong for us to fight her one  on one so we doubled teamed her.  We  barley got away.  For the next few months  she chased all over Europe.  We finally  lost her by the time we got back o Japan.  We decided  the whole experience was too bizarre for anyone to believe us so we kept it to  ourselves."</p><p>Soun was crying by this  point.  "Such a horrible ordeal!  And yet the path of a true martial artist is  fraught with peril!  I'm so proud of you  son!"</p><p>Genma wasn't so quick to  agree.  "Hold on a minute, Tendo.  This whole story sounds fishy.  I mean, c'mon, werewolves?  I don't really believe in such fairy tales."</p><p>No sooner did he say those  words Genma found himself flying through the air, compliments of Ranma, and  landing painfully in the koi pond outside.   "And I didn't used to believe in magic curses and griffins either," the  pony tailed youth yelled at his now mythical monster father.  "Besides, old man, Akane and Nabiki both said  they saw Emily turn into one, right?"</p><p>Kasumi again spoke up.  "So Ranma, basically what you're trying to  say is that Emily is Ryoga's fiancée."</p><p>Ranma gave a reluctant  nod.  "I guess you could put it that  way."</p><p>It wasn't until then the  eldest Tendo daughter realized she hadn't made the tea yet.  She quickly apologized and darted off to the  kitchen.</p><p>Soun, who had regained a bit  of control, faced Ranma again.  "But what  about the other person there?  That man  Akane said you called 'Pantyhose'?"</p><p>Ranma let out a little  laugh.  "I suppose that one is kinda my  fault.  It all started about a year and a  half ago.  This was during the trip to China.  Mom had  decided that me and Ryoga were at a high enough level where we couldn't really  learn anything else from her or Pop.  Pop  agreed, more or less, after Mom gave him a good talking to with her  katana.  So anyway we were traveling  around China on our own when we ran into this village…"</p><p>It was a very rural  village.  Considering that they were in  the Bayankala mountain range it wasn't that surprising.  There were a lot of things like that  there.  None the less this didn't steer  Ranma and Ryoga from it.  They were low  on supplies and had no choice.  Sadly  they were low on cash too (at least of the Chinese kind).  They had hoped they could make a deal but…</p><p>"Sorry, no handouts,"  a vendor said to them in mandarin.</p><p>"But how can you let two  innocent boys like us starve to death!" Ryoga demanded.  He, like Ranma, spoke pretty good Chinese due  to Nodoka's near obsession with them both knowing the way of the warrior as  well as the scholar.  It was the manly  thing to do, after all.</p><p>"Listen kid, this town's  got enough trouble.  We don't need any  beggars walking around.  Get lost!"</p><p>And so Ranma and Ryoga found  themselves up the creek without a paddle.   The pony tailed boy looked at his old friend.  "I guess we're pretty screwed then, huh?  Geez, I wonder what their problem is?"</p><p>Ryoga exploded at this.  "I'll tell you what their problem is: They're  evil, mean and stingy!"</p><p>"No, dummy," Ranma replied.  "That guy said 'this town's got enough problems.'  What do you think he meant?"</p><p>"I'll gladly tell you, boys"</p><p>Both martial artists turned  around to see a kindly old man looking at them.   His face was tired, and his hair was as white as it could possibly get.  "This town, you see, has been under attack  for the last six months."</p><p>Ryoga looked at the old guy  in shock.  "Th-that's impossible!"  The old man merely nodded but before he could  reply the lost boy cut him off.  "You  mean to tell me you speak perfect Japanese?"</p><p>Disgusted by Ryoga's ability  to get "off track" on the subject at, Ranma and the old man nearly fell face  first to the ground.  "That's not the  point, you young fool!  I'm trying to  help you.  As I was saying, this village  has been under the attack by a monster.   Some sort of demon cow, I'd wager."</p><p>Ranma gave the old man an odd  look.  "Demon cow?  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."</p><p>"Dumb or not, high on the  mountain on the outskirts of this town you can hear its tortured mooing.  Every few weeks the creature flies down and  steals our food!  The weapon's shop arranged  a reward for the man who can take that creature down, but alas, every warrior  who has dared ventured up there has retuned defeated.  If you two could somehow succeed where others  have failed then you would certainly win that prize and earn enough funds to  purchase supplies."</p><p>The two boys looked at each  other, then back at the old man.  It was  Ranma who spoke first.  "Why exactly are  you telling us this, old timer?"</p><p>The old man just  laughed.  "Don't you worry about that,  Ranma.  Just do as you're told."  With that he walked away from the two young  martial artists without so much as a "goodbye" or a "good luck."</p><p>Ranma scratched his  head.  "Well that was strange," he commented.  And of course he couldn't help but wonder how  the old man knew his name.</p><p>Despite the weirdness of the  encounter, Ranma and Ryoga decided that some "Demon Cow" was no match for  them.  So they ventured toward the small  mountain right outside the town boarders.   It was an uneventful trip for the most part (Ryoga kept having flashbacks  of the Lion Cub's Fist training that Genma had put him through when he was  younger).  They eventually made it to the  top only to find what appeared to be someone's campsite.  There was a rather large tent and a place  that could have been used to make a fire.   There was no one around however, thus making the two boys suspicious of  the old man's story.  If there was a  monster here why would someone set up camp?</p><p>"Maybe the monster got him  already," Ryoga suggested.  That would  have been very sad, but also a strong possibility of being true.</p><p>The two examined the place  for clues, but it wasn't until Ranma checked the tent that they found  something.  The pony tailed fighter  discovered a wallet and several packages of pantyhose.  At first they thought "Okay, maybe there was  a girl here."  However after expecting  the wallet they found a driver license that proved other wise.</p><p>"A picture  of a guy with the name 'Pantyhose Taro.'  What kind of a name is that?"  Ranma asked.  His friend just shrugged.  It didn't make a lot of sense, of course.</p><p>"Maybe the guy has a fetish,"  Ryoga suggested, pointing to the packages of pantyhose they found.</p><p>Their questions would soon be  answered when they were suddenly joined by another young man.  They hadn't noticed him until he announced  his presence by yelling "Who the hell are you?"   He seemed more annoyed then angry.</p><p>Both Ranma and Ryoga  jumped.  It was the same guy in the  picture.</p><p>It was the bandana clad  fighter who spoke first.  "Pantyh-"</p><p>"Don't say it!" the new  arrival growled, cutting Ryoga off.  It  was then he noticed Ranma had his wallet.   He quickly snatched it from him.   After making sure nothing was missing he turned back to the  intruders.  "You guys are the worse  thieves I've ever met.  Now get lost  before I rip you each a new asshole."</p><p>Neither Ranma nor Ryoga cared  for this guy's attitude.  They could tell  he was a martial artist; the way he carried himself gave it away.  He seemed like he was so confident (Dare they  say "cocky") in his own abilities that he didn't see ether of them as a threat.</p><p>"Look here, pal," Ryoga  barked.  "We're only here so we can beat  up the Demon Cow or whatever the hell it is."</p><p>Before Ryoga could continue  the Chinese fighter let a laugh.  "Demon  Cow?  Is that what those idiot villagers  are saying?  That's hilarious."</p><p>Both Japanese martial artist  looked attach other before looking at the boy they believed was named  "Pantyhose Taro."    "You've seen the  thing around here?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"None of you business," was  the reply.  "I thought I told you assholes  to beat it."</p><p>Ryoga was really starting to  lose his temper at this guy's rude attitude.   "Hey you jerk, don't take it out on us just because you got a pantyhose  fetish!"</p><p>This caused the rude  fighter's eye to twitch.  This did not go  unnoticed by Ranma, who was equally upset over the guy's attitude.  It was obvious that the pantyhose he kept was  a soft spot for this guy.  "Relax  Ryoga.  Let's just leave 'Pantyhose Taro'  here to play whatever perverted game he's got going on."</p><p>This did not sit were with  the green clothes clad fighter.  "You  bastard…!  You must got one hell of a  death wish, you son of a bitch!"</p><p>Ranma, whose own ego and  macho pride was swelling at this point, gave his trademark cocky grin.  "I ain't all that worried, 'Pantyhose.'  I mean how tough can a guy who actually calls  himself that be?"</p><p>Taro looked as if he was  being consumed with rage.  His eyes were  practically on fire.  "That's it, you  pony tailed piece of shit!  I'm gonna  kill you!"  With that he launched himself  at the Saotome Heir.</p><p>The fight was pretty  even.  Taro was very good, but of course  so was Ranma.   The Chinese boy was  almost as strong as Ryoga and a bit faster.   This caused Ranma to have to work extremely hard to keep from getting  seriously hurt, but once the pig tailed fighter got used to the boy's patter he  started gaining the upper hand.</p><p>After a while it seemed as if  Ranma was going to win.  Suddenly,  though, Taro backed off.  "I guess you're  a little better then I thought."</p><p>Ranma just smirked.  "Of course.   Don't you know that Ranma Saotome never loses?"</p><p>The Chinese fighter gave is  own grin.  "We'll see about that.  A lot of people have said that about me  too.  In fact I'll take both you assholes  on at once."</p><p>Ryoga laughed at that  remark.  "Yeah right.  You can't even get the upper hand on Ranma.  How are you gonna take both of us on?"</p><p>By this time Taro had grabbed  a flask from his tent.  Once again facing  the two fighters from Japan he coldly smiled and smile that would make grown men  shudder.  "Like this."</p><p>With that he poured the  liquid on himself.</p><p>"Turns out he was the  monster," Ranma continued.  "Some wired  mix of animals.  I later realized he had  to be from Jusenkyo and he was cursed just like Pop and me.  According the guide there's only one spring  that he could have fallen into to get that curse: Spring of Drowned Yeti Riding  a Bull while carrying an eel and crane.   Mixed all together you get a super strong flying creature."</p><p>As Kasumi returned from the  kitchen with the tea, her father gave a questioning glance at the pony tailed  boy.  "So, did you defeat this 'Pantyhose  Taro' person?"</p><p>Ranma smirked.  "Your damn right we beat that jerk. It wasn't  easy but Ryoga and I were able to bring him down."</p><p>Genma-Griffin simply nodded  as he poured his cup of tea over himself, returning him to human.  "I see.   So this Pantyhose fellow is just a prideful fighter who wants to regain  his honor by beating you."</p><p>The pony tailed fighter  looked a bit sheepish at this.  "Umm,  well kinda.  I mean, we may have done  something else to him but he's really just being a big baby about it…"</p><p>To this, his father's eyes  narrowed.  "What did you do, boy?"</p><p>"Well, we may have, sort of,  kind of dragged his unconscious body back to town, tied him against a rock that  we painted 'Hi, my name is Pantyhose Taro and I'm stupid' on it and place it in  the middle of town for everyone to see."</p><p>To this all three listeners  starred at the Saotome Heir with a blank expression.  It was Kasumi who spoke first.  "That wasn't very nice, Ranma."</p><p>"Hey, the guy was the biggest  jerk we'd ever seen," Ranma defended.   "He had it coming.  It was  justified."</p><p>Genma just shook his  head.  How could Ranma have had all these  experiences without him knowing about them?</p><p>"So that's that," The pony  tailed boy announced as he stood up from the table.  "I'll be in the dojo.  Let me know when dinner's ready."</p><p>Soun was annoyed at  this.  "Wait just a minute, son.  You haven't explained about the bounty on  your head."</p><p>Ranma shrugged.  "I have no idea why there's a bounty on my  head. Emily Tisdale is rich, maybe she put it on."  With that he calmly walked out of the room  toward the dojo, not bothering to look at the obviously unsatisfied expressions  on the two older men.</p><p>Kasumi simply starred at the  boy, as if she knew he was still hiding something.</p><p>Ranma's absence from school  had not gone unnoticed, and it rather annoyed both Tendo sisters.  The newly established "Ranma Saotome Fan  Club" (made up of the many girls at the school who had developed crushes on the  pony tailed fighter) would practically mug Akane and Nabiki for information  every chance they got.</p><p>Even though Nabiki was making  decent earnings selling information as well as photographs she was incredibly annoyed  with these girls.  The funny thing was  she wasn't sure why.  Sure, she could  admit she was attracted to Ranma, but the fact was that he was more trouble  then he was worth.  He had only been here  a short time but he already had gotten her involved with his questionable and  dangerous past.  It just wasn't right.</p><p>But the so-called "Ice Queen"  of Furikan High couldn't help herself.   Ranma had shown genuine romantic interest in her, something most boys at  school wouldn't do because of her reputation.   Having a normal boyfriend would be nice change.</p><p>For the past three days she  avoided Ranma, which wasn't too difficult since he was mostly in his room.  She wanted to sort out her feelings for the  boy; weighing the pros and cons of getting involved with the pony tailed boy.  Today was no exception.  During her lunch period she was preoccupied  with the internal conflict, thus she had her lackeys do the normal "routine" of  blackmail, extorting and other business deals.   Nabiki found herself eating her bento alone at the tree where she had  initially found Ranma earlier.  It was a  nice spot, just as it had been before.  Unfortunately  she would not be able to enjoy the quiet for much longer.</p><p>"Greetings, Nabiki Tendo,"  the familiar voice of Tatewaki Kuno bellowed.   Kuno had been absent for a while now.   In fact the only time Nabiki had seen him was at the junkyard three days  ago when he failed to defeat Emily Tisdale.</p><p>"Kuno, what a pleasant  surprise," she lied.  "What brings you  here today?"</p><p>The self titled "Blue  Thunder" showed no signs of emotions.  "I  require the status of Ranma Saotome.  Is  he well?  I had heard the rumors that he  laid broken in a hospital bed."</p><p>Nabiki rolled her eyes.  Ranma was too stubborn to go to a hospital,  claiming his injured would heal on there own given time.  "He's as well as can be expected.  But lemme ask you something, Kuno-baby: What's  with this weird crush you've had on Ranma lately anyway?"</p><p>This caused Kuno  irritation.  Nabiki of course was  referring to the interest the kendoist had had with Ranma even since the pony  tailed boy had mopped the floor with him in a sword fight.  "Crush?   You dare accuse the mighty Blue Thunder of such a thing?  I say thee nay!  I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my beck than I have  thoughts to put them in..."</p><p>Nabiki cut him off.  "If you're going to go on speaking nonsense  I'm going to have to charge you by the minute for taking up my precious time."</p><p>Kuno was offended at this,  but he nodded.  He handed her an  envelope.  "Very well, vile Nabiki.  I shall be brief:  Please pass this letter on to Saotome."</p><p>Before he could walk away in  a dramatic fashion Nabiki stopped him.   "That'll be a 5,000 yen delivery fee, Kuno-baby."</p><p>The dark haired boy just  starred at the middle Tendo daughter.   "You do realize I hate you."</p><p>"My heart bleeds.  Cash please."</p><p>Later that  day at the dojo Ranma was training; just as he had been doing all day.  He had decided  that it may be too dangerous to stick around in Nerima, so he'd need to do  something about the engagement and do it fast.    Luckily he had that plan he bought from Nabiki; train Akane in the  Saotome style and thus unite the schools.   He just needed an opportunity to do so without looking suspicious.  Genma would never agree to this arrangement  and if Soun was anything like the old man he wouldn't either.</p><p>But there was something else  that troubled him.</p><p>"I know you better then you  think, Ranma the Demon of Joketsuzoku!"  That was what that idiot Sin had said to  him.  What did he mean?  Why did he call him that?  What did this person have to do with the  amazons who resided there?  Did this have  to do with the bounty on his head?  There  were so many questions that he didn't have answers and for no they couldn't be  answered without information.  Of course  it was only a matter of time before someone would come to fill in the holes.  He'd have to be patient.</p><p>He was left with no time to  ponder the problem more as his thoughts were interrupted by the detection of  Kasumi who had at that moment come into the dojo.  As Ranma turned to meet her he saw that her  face was covered in various emotions making it hard to read her.  The heir to the Saotome School had noticed something very interesting about the  girl: she was either very dimwitted or insanely talented in masking and  detecting emotions.  He had begun to  believe the latter due to the fact she had picked up on his inner angst hat he  had been able to hide from his own father.</p><p>Though she seemed sort of oblivious  and uncaring at first Ranma realized was ready to admit that Kasumi could be at  least as intelligent as her sister Nabiki and even better at masking her  feelings with her cheerful demeanor.</p><p>"What's up, Kasumi?" he asked  with a warm smile.  Of course he had an  idea what this was about.</p><p>The older girl, whose face  was mixed with emotions and all of them negative, took  a deep breath before saying "I'd like to ask you about Tenma."</p><p>Ranma closed his eyes.  He had hoped he wouldn't have to tell anyone  about this; that he wouldn't be there long enough for it to matter.  He intended to tell the girl it was none of  her business again, but this time was different.  As he starred at the girl he saw the worry in  her eyes.  For whatever  reason the boy felt like he could trust Kasumi with this secret (or anything  for that matter).</p><p>After what seemed like  forever Ranma looked directly into the oldest Tendo sister's eyes.  "Aright.   I'll tell you everything."</p><p>The boy sat down on the floor  and motioned for Kasumi to join him.  She  complied and found a spot right next to him.   "It started…right after we buried mom.   Ryoga and I left to continue our training.  But truthfully I was an emotional wreck.  I was in a constant state of either anger or  depression.  I kept talking 'bout  suicide.  But most of all I wanted the  amazon who killed my mother dead!"</p><p>Kasumi gasp at that.  Ranma cursed under his breath; he had  forgotten that he had told Nabiki about that part, not her sister.  So he related to the death of Nodoka Saotome  and the controversy surrounding it.  Now  understanding, the older girl urged him to continue.</p><p>"Anyway I guess Ryoga  couldn't stand seeing me like that. So at some point he came across this weird statue.  He said he got it form some old man.  It was a magical item, he said, that would  rid someone of strong negative emotions."</p><p>Kasumi wasn't exactly sure  where he was going with this but she nodded politely none the less.</p><p>"I didn't believe it, of  course.  It sounded pretty stupid, even  though I'd seen my fair share of magic by then.   But low and behold it started glowing as soon as I touched it.  Technically though you could say it didn't  work…</p><p>"There was a flash of light,  so strong that it nearly blinded me.   When the light stopped there was a guy, who looked about fifteen or  sixteen, lying on the ground.  And he had  my face.  He looked exactly like me.  Well, I guess his eyes were grey instead of  blue but besides that yeah."</p><p>The listener's eyes opened  wide.  "You mean there was another  you?"  Ranma nodded.  However Kasumi looked as if she didn't  believe him.  "How is that possible?"</p><p>"Magic, I guess."  Looking on at Kasumi's expression the boy gave  a light smile. "Don't tell me it's any less believable than a guy who changes  genders when hit by water or his father who turns into a mythical monster."</p><p>Feeling a bit silly for her  momentary disbelief she let him continue.</p><p>"So there was the guy who looked  exactly like me laying there on the ground unconscious.  He was like some kind of perfect copy.  We brought him back to where we were camped  and waited for him to come to.  When he  did he looked directly at me and 'I see, so I'm not the real Ranma.'  I'll never forget that; he seemed really sad  when he said it.  It turned out he had  all of my memories up to when I touched the statue.  He explained that even though he had my  memories there was a strong feeling in his soul that told him he wasn't the  'real Ranma Saotome.'  He said he didn't  know how to put it in words.  All he  could say was that he was more certain that he was a fake than anything else."</p><p>Kasumi eyes again widen in  surprise.  What was it Ryoga had said  when he and Ranma had that brief argument the night Nabiki was kidnapped?  "He was a shadow, not a human."  He was referring to…</p><p>"That 'copy' was…Tenma?"</p><p>Ranma nodded.  "That was the name he eventually started  calling himself.  He said it wouldn't be  right to call himself 'Ranma' since we all knew he wasn't.  So he asked to be called Tenma Saotome so he  could be considered a different person.   That was real important to him, being known as a different person than  me"</p><p>The eldest Tendo daughter  wasn't sure what to think. It was like a twist in a bad soap opera; Ranma and  Tenma, long lost twin brothers.  "So this  Tenma person was another you?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head.  He wore a slight smile, as if he was  recalling fond yet old memories.  "At  first we thought that too.  He was even  as strong as me.  I mean we were  seriously dead even.  After I gave him  some clothes Ryoga and I said he could tag along on our trip if he wanted  to.  After a while we figured out Tenma  was actually a lot different from me; he was a lot more likely to pick fights  with people, he acted kinda cold to pretty much everyone, and he hardly ever  talked. He was always sitting or standing somewhere thinking about who knows  what.  He was the one who figured it out:  the statue didn't take someone's negative emotions away, it 'physically  manifested them into a new body,' is how he put it."</p><p>Kasumi was trying to keep up  but it was actually pretty confusing.   "So all the sadness and anger you felt about your mother was taken from  you and was turned into Tenma?"</p><p>The pony tailed martial artist  shrugged.  "I guess. But I didn't feel  any happier after it happened so I don't know.   But basically Tenma was like a more…mean version of me.  But he was a real good guy.  In fact most of the fights he got into were  because he was saving some guy from getting beat on or sticking up for some kid  or old person.  He hated seeing people  picking on guys weaker than them, just like I do.  He was really into the whole 'martial artists  should protect the weak' thing.  He was  just…overly violent about it."</p><p>"Oh my, what do you mean?"  the listener asked with immense interest.</p><p>Ranma scratched his  head.  "Let's just say he doesn't hold  back in a fight.  I guess he was kinda of  a hypocrite.  But anyway he and I got along  really well, I thought.  I mean we had  the same memories but we were different enough that we weren't exactly the  same.  I only knew him a month but I  consider Tenma one of m closet friends.   Hell, he was pretty much my brother, I guess.</p><p>"But…Tenma had issues.  He never talked about it, but he was really  upset over mom getting killed and extremely pissed at the amazon who did  it.  In fact he hated amazons in  general.  I knew he wanted payback, I did  too, but he was really general about it. He once said to me that it wasn't just  the one amazon's fault, it was her society and its laws."</p><p>Ranma paused a short  while.  Kasumi could tell he was trying  to contain himself emotionally.  It was  obvious he was about to relate to the subject of Tenma's demise and his part in  it.  It was, as it had been as long as  she had known him, an extremely sensitive subject after all.</p><p>"So," Ranma said after a  while.  "After about a month of training  we went to this one training spot on top of a particularly high mountain.  Tenma comes up to me with this map he had  bought a while ago. It showed exactly where the amazon village was.  I was pretty close to where we were.  He wanted to go there and do something to  them.  Maybe poison their water supply or  maybe set a bunch of fires.  It was crazy  and I told him so. But he just got upset.   He wanted them to pay.  He said he  wanted that they needed to pay for their crimes.  I was afraid he'd get a lot of people who  didn't have anything to do with it hurt.   Maybe killed.  So I tried to stop  him.  Then he hit me.  I don't know what got into me but I hit him  back and before you knew it we were at each other's throats.  Even Ryoga couldn't pull us apart.  It got really intense at one point and we…we  were too close to the edge…"</p><p>Again Ranma paused.  After a short while he continued.  "I knocked him off the edge.  I feel back…I was able to grab his arm but…he  just looked at me and said 'It's better this way' and just let go…"</p><p>The memory of the even was so  intense he didn't notice his own tears.   "I…I killed him.  He died because  of the argument.  I don't care what Ryoga  says, he was a living breathing human.   He didn't deserve to die like that.   I shouldn't have fought him; I should have been quicker to pull him back  up…"</p><p>Before he could continue with  his speech he found himself being embraced.   Kasumi had wrapped her arms around the pony tailed boy in hi vulnerable state.  She pulled him lose and spoke softly into his  ears.  "It wasn't your fault, Ranma.  It was a horrible situation.  You aren't a murderer…"  She said nothing after tat and continued to  hold him.</p><p>Ranma was shocked.  He had fully expected her to think he was a  monster, a reckless little boy who made the ultimate mistake.  However she was being so kind and so  understanding.  This was the first time  Ranma had ever opened up to anyone.   Closing his eyes he and hugged back on instinct.</p><p>He was so wrapped up in his  emotions that he failed to notice the girl standing in the doorway.</p><p>Nabiki walked away from the  dojo, not certain as to what just happened.   She had just gotten home and s ready to give Ranma his letter from Kuno,  but when she got there she found Ranma crying in Kasumi's arms.  Usually she would have taken a picture to use  in some sort of blackmail scheme…but for some reason she felt sick and needed  to get away from there.  The next day  she'd come to her senses and try to figure out logically why Ranma and her  sister were in that embrace…but tonight she really needed to be alone.</p><p>To be continued…</p><p>Author's note:  Well I guess it's been a long while,  huh?  Does anyone even remember this  story?  Oh well.  To make up for the long absence you get this  slightly larger than normal chapter and revisions for chapters 1-5.  You'll notice that I've taken a few things  out, added a few things.  I'm sure it's  by no means perfect yet, but we'll get there.</p><p>Anywho today's chapter  finally explains who Tenma is.  However  even more questions are brought up.   Questions that won't be answered for a few chapters.   While it's obvious that Tenma is connected  to the opening scene we don't know for certain how.  You may think you do, but you don't.   Stay tuned.</p><p>Next Chapter:  Ranma is all healed up and everything gets  back to normal.  Except that there's this  girl with a black rose causing problems.   Also Mousse and Sin continue plotting and the amazons make their move.</p>
