</div>                Disclaimer:  Ranma ½ was created by Rumiko Takahashi.  I had nothing to do with it.  Please do not sue me; I go to college and  therefore am broke.<p>The Nerima District of Tokyo  had often been regarded as a weird place, somewhat dangerous place.  It had just become worse.</p><p>Across the street from the  Tendo Dojo a bounty hunter was contemplating his next move.  He had tracked down the target to this  house.  However if the crime was indeed  what the buyer claimed then attacking head one would be suicide.  Despite the danger the ninja who had long  forgotten his own name truly wished that Ranma Saotome was as strong as they  say.</p><p>It had been far too long since he had been  able to unleash all of his abilities.</p><p><b>Chapter 4</b></p><p><b>Prelude</b></p><p>Ranma was dreaming  again.  It was the same dream as  always.  His mother questioning his  manhood while Tenma demanding to know why he killed him.  It had been the same every night for over a  year.   However for the last few weeks it  had seemed like the dreams had gotten more intense.</p><p>Thankfully (Sort of) the pony  tailed fighter found himself suddenly doused by cold water forcing him  awake.  The now red headed Ranma shot up  from her futon, only to be face to face with a giggling Ryoga.</p><p>"Heh,  I wandered around the house for six hours looking for your room but it was  worth it."  The bandana clad martial  artist was by now laughing uncontrollably.</p><p>Ranma growled at her old  friend's evil wake up call.  Looking out  the window she saw that it was pre-sunrise and it being Sunday there was no  point of being up this early.  She had  wanted to sleep in, hoping to recover from the fight the day before.</p><p>It was then Ryoga noticed  that there was the empty futon next to his old training partner.  "Where's the old man?"<br/>Ranma shrugged.  "After you beat the crap  out of him the third time last night Pop decided it'd be smart to sleep in a  secret place that you wouldn't be able to find which happens to be the  roof."  She smiled innocently.</p><p>The lost boy shook his  head.  "I guess I'll beat on him later.  I have some stuff to show you."  With that the lost boy took off the pack he  had been wearing on his back and gently placed it on the floor.  He opened it raveling several strange  objects.  "Let's see, magic coffee mug,  possessed toy dog, anti perverted ghost charms…"</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow.  "Where the hell did you get all this stuff?"</p><p>Ryoga smiled, raveling his  fangs.  "Oh, you know, here and  there."  He turned his attention back onto  the contents in his bag.  "Ah here is," he  said as he pulled a scroll from his pack.</p><p>The pony tailed girl  questioned the object in her friend's hand.   "What's that?  Some  kind of technique?"</p><p>The eternal lost boy  nodded.  "I came across it during my  travels.  It's an insanely strong chi  attack when perfected.  The man I got it  from was a master of chi attacks and preferred this technique over all the  others in his arsenal.  He demonstrated  it to me.  The attack left a huge crater,  maybe the size of a small town."</p><p>Looking over the scroll, Ranma rolled his eyes.  "Let's see here. 'Shi Shi Hokodan.'  You didn't use this during our fight.  You weren't holding back, were ya?"</p><p>Ryoga lowered his head.  "I haven't perfected it yet."</p><p>The younger Saotome began  laughing at this.  "You dummy.  Give me the scroll and I'll master it in two  days tops."</p><p>"It's not that simple," Ryoga  spat out.  He was not amused by his old  friend's attitude.  "This technique  channels its power from a certain emotion:   Depression.  I haven't been able  to master it because I haven't been able to get sad enough.  Even with Auntie Nodoka's death in account  all I've managed to do is the unperfected version which isn't as strong as the  Daijishin Bakuhatsu anyway."</p><p>Ranma nodded.  Ryoga's reasoning aside, an attack where you  had to be sad in order to use it sounded pretty dumb.</p><p>"Also," her friend  continued.  "It's dangerous to the  user.  Every person who has mastered this  technique killed themselves, and the man who gave me this scroll wasn't far  behind either.  It seems that if you use  this attack too much the sadness becomes unbearable..."</p><p>Ranma finished Ryoga's  sentence.  "And the only way to escape  the sadness is through death.  Something  like that sounds too risky for my taste."   Despite saying this Ranma was seriously considering trying to learn this  technique.  It wouldn't be for everyday  use, obviously, but if she were to ever fight in a losing battle with high  stakes…</p><p>The "girl" shrugged the  thought off.  "I'm gonna go get some hot  water.  After I've changed we might as  well spar a bit since you woke me up."   The sun was rising anyway. There was rally no excuse not to.</p><p>Kasumi had just finished  putting out the plates for breakfast when her family (Plus one bald guest) made  their way to the dinning room.</p><p>"Good morning, everyone,"  Kasumi said in her usual cheerful tone.</p><p>"Good morning Kasumi," they  all replied.</p><p>Akane, who had skipped her  usual morning jog so she could sleep in for a change, looked onto the  backyard.  Her fiancé and Ryoga were  currently engaged in a sparring match that was no less intense then the usual  fights between Ranma and his father.   "Wow, they're really going at it."</p><p>Kasumi just shook her  head.  "They've been doing this for hours  now.  I think it's abut time I call them  in."</p><p>Genma smiled at what the girl  said.  "They've been fighting for hours,  eh?  No need to trouble yourself,  Kasumi.  I'll be happy to bring them in."  He cracked his knuckle for emphasis.   Though he would never admit it out loud, both boys had managed to  surpass him.  But a worn out Ryoga would  still be easy pickings.  He'd just remind  the lost boy who was the master and who was the student.</p><p>None of the Tendos bothered  to look in the direction of the lawn.</p><p>"Boy's it's time for  breakfast," they heard the old man say.</p><p>"GENMA…DIE!  DAIJISHIN BAKUHATSU!" Was the reply they  heard in Ryoga's voice.  What followed  was the sound of a one sided beating that didn't seem to be in the favor  Ranma's father.</p><p>By this time Ranma had sat  down at the table and began digging into the food that was in front of him.</p><p>"Ranma," Akane said uneasily.  "Why does Ryoga hate your father so much?"</p><p>Not looking away from his  plate, Ranma replied "It's because of all the stupid training Pop did to him.  Pop  had this old martial arts technique book that he kept trying to use with me,  but Mom thought they were too dangerous.   But Pop's a really stubborn griffin.</p><p>"Whenever Ryoga wandered off  somewhere Pop would volunteer to look for 'em.  After he found him he'd make him undergo a  random technique from the guide.  Unfortunately  Pop was too stupid to read the whole book."</p><p>At that moment Genma was  flung back into the house smacking right into a wall.  Ryoga raced after him. Seeing that the old  man wasn't conscious anymore he simply reached into cursed martial artist's gi  and removed a book that he had been keep there. He tossed it to Ranma.</p><p>The title of the book was  "Martial Arts Techniques That You Shouldn't Use" and it was written by some guy  named Dave Barry.</p><p>Ranma opened the book and  read "These techniques are jokes and only insane idiots would even consider  trying to learn or teach them."  The pony  tailed martial tossed the book aside.</p><p>"I'm sure that the training  wasn't all that bad," Soun commented.   Genma was his friend and he knew that he wouldn't do anything that would  harm one of his students.</p><p>Ryoga responded by picking up  the book and reciting from it.  "#34, the  Art of the Lion Cub's Fist.  Toss subject  off side of mountain.  If subject manages  to climb backup up toss him/her off again.   Repeat until subject has learned the Lion Club Fist or dies.  Whichever comes first." He paused while he  flipped through some more pages.  "#57  The Cat Fist.  Wrap subject with fish  sausage.  Then place subject in a pit of  starving cats. Repeat process until subject has mastered Cat-Fu."    The  lost boy then sat down at his own place at the table and began eating, angrily mumbling  at Genma's stupidity.</p><p>"He did those techniques and  more all before the lost boy over there turned 11," Ranma added for good  measured.</p><p>The Tendo family looked to  where Genma lay.  If he had really forced  Ryoga to do such things as a child then perhaps he deserved the constant  beatings he received.</p><p>Ranma gave a cheerful smile  and happily declared "That was delicious, Kasumi.  Can I have seconds?"</p><p>A bit later the pony tailed  martial artist had taken off, saying he had things to do.  Nabiki had also left, saying she had planned  to do some shopping.  Kasumi was busy  with house work, while Soun and Genma had gone off somewhere to make plans for  Ranma and Akane's marriage (i.e. they went to find alcohol).  Ryoga and Akane had pretty much been left  alone in house.</p><p>The lost boy wouldn't admit  it, but he was worried that he would wander off somewhere.  So he had Ranma take him to the dojo before  he left.   Currently the fanged martial artist was  practicing some katas.  Like Ranma, katas  helped Ryoga think.</p><p>It seemed that Genma wasn't  happy of destroying the bandana clad fighter's life, but now with his wife out  of the picture, the fat martial artist had begun on his own son.  The old man had taken advantage of Ranma's  honorable nature and forced him into, what was no doubt, a drunken promise made  years ago. Ranma would indeed go along with this marriage if he was unable to  get out it honorably.  That was his  greatest flaw in the lost boy's opinion: He was too damn honorable.  It was the same with that Tenma incident…</p><p>Ryoga's thoughts were  interrupted when Akane suddenly entered the dojo.  She gave him a smile.  "Hey Ryoga."</p><p>He regarded the long haired  for moment.  This may be a good way to  find an "out" for his old friend.  Never  mind the fact that what Ryoga failed to realize was that this marriage was  unwanted by Akane as well.</p><p>"Hey  Akane," Ryoga greeted.</p><p>The long haired girl was  dressed in her dogi, so it was doubtful she had just come to talk.  "I was thinking maybe we could spar.  You know, to see how I measure up."</p><p>Ryoga snorted at this.  "Feh, I don't fight girls."</p><p>Akane looked at him with a  questioning glance.  "Why  the hell not?"</p><p>"I'll tell you straight;  girls are weak.  They're frail and  dainty.  They should just stick with what  they're good at, like cooking and cleaning."</p><p>Ironically Ryoga would, in a  few days, regret suggesting Akane to cook.   For now though he had just mad the mistake of making the youngest Tendo  sister.</p><p>She grabbed his collar  angrily.  "You sexist jerk!  Ranma's a jerk too but it least he sparred  with me."</p><p>"Ranma spent most of his time  being trained by a woman, so it's understandable that he thinks that way."</p><p>"While  we're on the subject, what about Ranma's Mom?  Wasn't she a  strong martial artist?"</p><p>"Well, I guess.  I never saw Auntie Nodoka fight all that  much.  She never really taught me too  much about sword fighting so I rarely saw her skill as a fighter."</p><p>Akane's anger suddenly was  replaced by curiosity.  She let go of the  boy's shirt.  "Is that why you two fight  so differently?"</p><p>Ryoga raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"I mean," the girl went  on.  "I mean Ranma is faster than you and  can fight with a sword.  But you're much  stronger than he is and don't seem you use any weapons.  You both trained in the same style, I could  tell by the stance you were using yesterday, but you fight differently."</p><p>The lost boy nodded.  "Well, I'm told I have natural strength and  stamina.  My mother once told me it's a  family trait.  I guess it makes up for  the sense of direction."  He said the  last bit with a slightly embarrassed tone.   He blushed a bit before going on.   "I guess the old man noticed this and gave me training that was more  geared for my special talents: strength and stamina.  Ranma's faster than me and is better at  fighting mid-air, though.  It sorta  balances out in a fight."</p><p>Akane nodded, understanding  the difference.  "Well then," she said as  she went into an offensive stance.  "Shall  we spar?"</p><p>Ryoga rolled his eyes.  "Fine, but don't expect me to hit you."</p><p>Like his training partner,  the boy had not bothered to take up a stance.</p><p>"See ya  later, doc."</p><p>Dr. Tofu waved goodbye to his  pony tailed visitor.  Ranma had come to  visit much to the doctor's pleasant surprise.</p><p>A little  earlier.</p><p>"Yo,"  Tofu had heard from the waiting room.</p><p>"Hello, Ranma," he said to  the young martial artist.  "Is there  anything wrong?  Any  injuries?"</p><p>"Nope," was the cheerful response.  "It's a  social visit.  Well, sort of."</p><p>The kindly doctor gave an  equally cheerful smile. "Well, why don't I make us some tea and we can chat for  a bit."  He wasn't that busy, business  was a bit slow today, and he did enjoy the boy's company.</p><p>A bit later the two were  enjoying some tea in the doctor's office.</p><p>Tofu was the first to  talk.  "So Ranma, what can I do for you?"</p><p>"Well, initially I came to  say hello. But I did have a favor to ask."</p><p>Tofu narrowed his eyes ever  so slightly.</p><p>Ranma either didn't notice or  didn't care. "I'm looking for a job."</p><p>The young doctor  relaxed.  "Oh I see.  I was in fact looking for an assistant to  help around the office.  I wouldn't be  able to pay you much I'm afraid."</p><p>Ranma shrugged.  "Don't worry about that, Doc.  I'll do it for free."</p><p>Tofu lifted an eyebrow.  "For free?   Ranma, I couldn't let you…"</p><p>The pony tailed boy cut him  off.  "I guess it wouldn't be free,  exactly.  In return I thought you could  teach me some shiatsu techniques.  I'm  already pretty much the best, but I'm kinda lacking in that area."</p><p>Tofu smiled.   "I think we can arrange something."</p><p>The doctor headed back into his  office.  Ranma Saotome really was an  interesting subject.  He knew the boy had  a great destiny of head him.  The doctor  just wondered if he would be able to get a glimpse of it before he had to leave  Nerima forever.  It wouldn't be for a  while, he predicted. However in the meantime he could use this opportunity to  point the pony tailed youth in the right direction.</p><p>Things were going Dr. Tofu's  way.  Now if only he could talk to Kasumi  without acting like a maniac.</p><p>Not far from the clinic  Ranma, who wasn't going anywhere in particular, suddenly stopped.  "Come out already.  It's not like you could hide from me, ya  know."</p><p>From an alley Nabiki slowly  walked out onto the side walk.  "I guess  it's useless to try to hide from a guy who claims he can sense people's auras."</p><p>"Actually I saw you following  me a few blocks after I left the house," Ranma bragged.  "You need to be more discreet if you wanna to  sneak by a martial artist of my caliber."</p><p>Nabiki rolled her eyes. Ranma  was as cocky as ever.</p><p>The pony tailed youth smiled  at his fiancée's sister.  "Hey, since  we're both out why don't I treat ya to lunch.   Maybe you'll be able to trick me into telling you all my secrets.  I mean I'm juts a dumb jock, right?"</p><p>It was Nabiki's turn to  smile.  She admitted that she had  underestimated Ranma a few days ago, but strangely she found herself not all  that upset about being wrong.</p><p>Ryoga looked over at an exhausted  Akane who was lying on the floor.  He had  dodge and blocked all of her attacks for roughly an hour. She had tired herself  out, but the lost boy was just bored.   Though he noticed that Akane was much stronger than he predicted she'd  be.  Of course she was no near his league  in terms of strength, or even Ranma for that matter, but still much stronger  than a girl should be..</p><p>Ryoga decided to pay her the  compliment.  "You may be slow, but you're  pretty strong.  Kind of like a  gorilla."  Perhaps Ryoga should work on  his complimentary skills.</p><p>Akane's energy suddenly  returned as she punched the boy right in the face with peed and power she had  not shown earlier.  "YOU JERK!" She cried  as she sent Ryoga into the wall.</p><p>The bandana clad fighter slowly  picked himself up.  "You  tomboy, why'd you have to hit a guy like that?"</p><p>Akane's eye was twitching.  "Do they just train you guys to be jerks or what?  Is there some technique that you and Ranma  learned that made you tactless?"</p><p>Ryoga didn't answer as the dojo  door suddenly flung open.  Time itself  froze.  A cloaked figured slowly walked  in.  Even Akane could feel the anger and  sadness that seemed to surround this person.</p><p>The cloaked figure smiled,  not that Ryoga or Akane could tell.   "That broad in at the front door said you were here, but I guess deep  down I just couldn't really believe it.   It's been a long time, Ryoga Hibiki."</p><p>The lost boy raised an  eyebrow.  "Do I know you, mysterious  cloaked man with a wish for vengeance?"</p><p>This set the new arrival off.  "You bastard, I've spent years preparing to  send you to hell!  The least you could do  is remember my name!"</p><p>For some reason Ryoga felt  like her had heard this speech before, but he couldn't for the life of him  remember where.  He shrugged it off for the  moment.  "Umm, maybe I'd know who you  were if you removed the black cloak."</p><p>The figure froze.  He had forgotten he had the thing on!  He slowly removed it revealing a brown spiky  haired, handsome boy wear a sleeve less tattered school vest and jeans.  He seemed to be a street punk of some  sort.  "How about now?"</p><p>Ryoga didn't move.  He thought about it for a while.</p><p>"Well," Akane said  impatiently.</p><p>Ryoga was at this point  thinking extremely hard.  He looked like  his head was going to explode.</p><p>"Don't strain you brain,  Ryoga," the girl joked.</p><p>The angry spiky headed boy  was shocked.  "Y-you don't  remember?"  If Ryoga had forgotten him  would that mean that he had wasted the past four years of his life?</p><p>Ryoga gave an apologetic  smile.  "Sorry," was all he could think  to say.</p><p>Akane looked at her fiancé's  friend.  She inwardly made a comment  about his lack of intelligence.</p><p>"My name is Kenji Arashii,"  spiky head yelled.  "And four years ago  you ruined my life!"</p><p>Four years ago</p><p>Ryoga had gotten lost on his  way to lunch.  Ranma had forgotten to  come by his class room to guide him to the cafeteria so he had to find it on hi  sown.  The lost boy had been wandering  for hours and still no sign of the cafeteria.   In fact he believed he was outside.   "Wait a second…this isn't my campus."</p><p>Indeed it seemed that he had  mistakenly wandered onto another campus.   Thankfully it wasn't too far from where he and the Saotomes were staying  so hopefully he could find his way home within a week.</p><p>Just as he turned to leave he  noticed some spiky haired kid beating on some other, weaker looking  children.  Ryoga became angry, because if  there was one thing he hated it was someone picking on the weak.</p><p>"Hey, you  spiky haired shit head!"  Ryoga yelled at the bully.  "If you wanna fight someone, fight me!"</p><p>Kenji smirked as he saw this  cocky punk challenging him.  He was the  top fighter in town and it was laughable that anyone would try to mess with  him.  "Heh, you think you can take me  on?  Dumbass, I'll kick the shit the  outta ya!"</p><p>The fight had lasted about  five seconds.  Ryoga won.</p><p>This scene repeated itself  for a few weeks as Ryoga asked Ranma if they could swing by there every day on  the way to and from school.  And everyday  Ryoga would kick the crap out of him for bullying some poor kid.</p><p>"Everyday that punk would  stick his nose in my business!  No one  would take me serious after that!  They  kept calling me 'The guy who gets his ass kicked by that kid with no sense of  direction.'  It got so bad I had to challenge  that jerk to a real fight.  But he never  showed."</p><p>Akane looked at Ryoga with a  questioning glance.  "Umm, I got lost."</p><p>Kenji spat.  "Shut up!   Now that I've finally found you I'm gonna kick you ass!"</p><p>He dashed at his opponent  only to find himself connected to Ryoga's fist to his face.  He fell backwards  unconscious.</p><p>The lost boy sadly  sighed.  "He was just street punk.  That was way too easy."</p><p>Akane eyed the defeated  Kenji.  After all that talk he went down  with one punch.  "It's just like Ranma  with Kuno," she thought.</p><p>Ryoga was about to pick up  the boy when again the dojo door opened up.   Standing in the doorway was a short, shy looking boy.  He was holding a gigantic sword that seemed  way too big for him.</p><p>"Excuse me," he said to the fanged  martial artist.  "Are you Ryoga Hibiki?"</p><p>The lost boy wasn't sure how  to answer that.  "Umm…yeah."</p><p>"I see," the boy looked a bit  sad.  His expression didn't change as he  suddenly pointed his large sword in Ryoga's direction.  "I'm sorry, but now I must kill you."</p><p>Ryoga pinched the bridge of  his nose.  "Right. Of course you do."</p><p>Meanwhile, at a restaurant in  downtown Nerima, Ranma was currently treating his finance's sister to what  would be considered a date.  And of  course that would be considered cheating.</p><p>They had engaged in small  talk for while.  After they were half way  done with their meal Nabiki finally brought up the subject of Tenma.</p><p>"Wow, it only took you about  a half hour before you could bring that up," Ranma had said cheerfully.  He gave her a thumbs up.  "Nice control."</p><p>Nabiki rolled her eyes.  "Saotome, you have been avoiding this topic  ever since Kasumi first brought it up.   Can't you at least give me some clues?'</p><p>Ranma  became serious.  He closed his eyes and  crossed his arms "Tenma is my business.   Just forget about him."</p><p>This  was a rare sight, to see Ranma drop his front.   She felt something inside the pony tailed boy.  It was a deep sadness.  She didn't understand how she could know  that, but she definitely decided she liked the happy Ranma opposed to the sad  Ranma.</p><p>The  Ice Queen thought that a subject change was in order.</p><p>"So  Ranma," she began.  "Do you really have  any intention of marrying my sister?"</p><p>The  boy quickly put came back to himself.   "Not if I can help it. But honor demands that I marry Akane.  If I could find someway to honorably escape  it I'd jump at the chance."</p><p>Nabiki  gave him a cold smile.  "Well Ranma, I  happened to have an idea that could get you out of the engagement and still  retain your honor."</p><p>Ranma  perked up.  "Tell me."</p><p>The  mercenary girl held out her palm.  "20,000 yen."</p><p>The  pony tailed boy fell from his chair.  He  should have seen that coming.  Picking  himself up, he reached into his pocket and removed the roll of cash he carried  around.  Without blinking or showing signs  of remorse the boy handed over the money.</p><p>Nabiki  was a bit surprised that Ranma could part with 20,000 yen so easily.  It led to believe he had even more money  somewhere which only made him more interesting.   "Well Saotome, it's really simple.   It seems the agreement that my daddy and your daddy signed doesn't imply  marriage."</p><p>Ranma  lifted an eyebrow.  "Really?"</p><p>The  girl nodded.  "It seems that the deal was  only to unite the schools.  A marriage  between you and Akane that produces an heir would be one way of doing  this.  However there is another way that  you can unite the schools."</p><p>The  Chinese clothed boy had begun to catch on.   "One of us could learn the other school's style!"</p><p>Nabiki  winked at her current client.  "See,  simple.  But since Daddy hasn't been  stable enough to be a sensei in years and Akane doesn't have the patients to  teach someone I guess you'll have to teach my dear little sister the way of the  Saotome School."</p><p>Ranma  was ecstatic.  "That is brilliant!  Normally girls shouldn't undergo the  training, but your sister becomes freakishly strong when she's angry.  I'm sure she can survive it."  The boy then began laughing uncontrollably.</p><p>The  brown haired girl began to wonder if telling him was such a great idea.</p><p>A  giant of a man who was dressed as a sumo was now facing Ryoga in the dojo.  The building itself was a mess.  Not surprising as several martial artist with  a reason for beating up Ryoga had shown up throughout the day.  This man before him claimed his life went to  hell because Ryoga beat him in an arm wrestling contest six years ago.</p><p>"Ryoga  Hibiki, prepare to die," the sumo yelled as he came at the lost bow with a  barrage of open palm fist strikes.  Ryoga  was able to dodge them all, though not with the same grace that Ranma would  have used.  Eventually the lost boy grew  tired of this game.  He leapt up,  delivering a snap kick to the giant sumo which knocked him on his back causing  the ground to shake furiously.</p><p>The  bandana clad fighter dusted off his hands before going back to picking up his  opponent and dragging him outside. "How many is that?"  He asked Akane who had been watching from the  sideline.</p><p>"That  was number seven," she sighed.  "Just how  many people out there want to kill you?"</p><p>Ryoga  smiled.  "More than seven."  The lost boy had beaten them all without half  trying.  "This sort of thing happens to  me all the time."</p><p>As  Ryoga tossed the sumo over the fence that surrounded the yard Kasumi appeared  from within the house.</p><p>Her  cheerful smile had not left her face even when some of the guest she brought to  the dojo told her they were here to kill Ryoga.   "Have you two seen Mr. Saotome?"</p><p>Both  teens shook their heads.</p><p>"That's  too bad, since it seems that our latest guest is looking for him," the older  girl sighed.</p><p>A  large bearded man, with long flowing hair and wearing strange armor walked out  of the house behind the oldest Tendo Sister.   He had a fairly large sword strapped to his back.  "Bwahahahaha!   My name is Kabato, a wandering warrior.  However my enemies call me Kabato the Blade!  I come from a small village that, within the  last two days, was attacked and raided by a monster known as a griffin."</p><p>Ryoga  lowered his head.  Genma seemed to only  get worse.</p><p>Kabato  the Blade continued.  "The devil made the  mistake of attacking while I, Kabato the Bade, was visiting my mother.  I gave the creature a beating with my immense  strength and now I've tracked the it here.  I, Kabato the Blade, will finish the  job.  Bwahahahaha!"</p><p>All  three listeners felt the need to walk always from this man.  Ryoga however decided to add a little gas to  the fire.</p><p>"You  know," the lost boy began.  "That griffin  monster can take the form of a bald, fat martial artist who wears glasses.  He's not here right now, but I bet if you  came back later you'll find him."</p><p>Kabato  the Blade eyes widen.  "Is that  true?  Does the beast take on human  form?  Bwahahahaha, the creature has been  hiding from me. But fear not! I, Kabato the Blade, shall destroy it before it  attacks again. With that I am off!"</p><p>And  so he was.  He leapt over the fence from  where he was standing and took off looking to defeat the dreaded griffin.</p><p>Akane  gave Ryoga a dirty look.  "Do you think  it was right to tell that man about Mr. Saotome's curse?"</p><p>Ryoga  shrugged.  "Genma can take care of  himself.  The worse that can happened is  that Kabato guy kills him.  Wait, that's  the best case scenario.  Bwahahahaha!"</p><p>After laughing like that both Tendo sisters quickly  left the boy alone in the yard.  A rain cloud seemed to appear over the head  the youth and drowse him.  "Lonely," was  all he could say.</p><p>Tatewaki  Kuno had been MIA for about a day or so.   Some people believed he had been killed by Ranma (Though the same people  didn't seem to care enough to call the police).   However the kendoist had gone in to hiding to reflect on his latest battle  with the pony tailed boy.  Today he had decided  to face him after much thought.  As he  made his way to the Tendo dojo he saw a large bearded man run in a random  street yelling something about griffins, waving his sword around, and laughing  uncontrollably.</p><p>Kuno  gave the man a weird look.  "Delusional fool."</p><p>With  that he made his way toward the Tendo Dojo.   Upon reaching his destination he didn't bother knocking on the  door.  He was Tatewaki Kuno after  all.  Instead he leapt over the fence  landed gracefully on the yard (Thunder could be heard in the distance).  He looked around seeing only Ryoga who was  still sad about being left alone.</p><p>"You  there," Kuno yelled.  "I know not why you  have seen it fit to stand in the yard of the fair Akane Tendo, but since I have  come on business I shall let you live for now.   Thank the gods that Blue Thunder had spared you this day."</p><p>The  lost boy stared blankly at the new arrival.</p><p>Kuno  went on.  "I am Tatewaki Kuno, age  17.  No doubt you have heard of me.  I have come searching for Ranma Saotome.  Where is he?"</p><p>Ryoga  felt a bit relieved.  This nut was here  for Ranma and not him.  He had had enough  people coming over to kill him for one day.   "Ummm, he went out a while ago.  I  don't know when he'll be back."</p><p>Kuno  made not expression when he heard this.   "I see.  I suppose he'll be at  school tomorrow.  I shall see him  then."  With that the kendoist turned to  leave.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks when  he heard a familiar voice.   "Upperclassman?  What are you doing  here?"</p><p>Kuno turned back to see Akane  standing at the entrance to the Tendo home.   His expression lifted slightly.   "My love…"  He quickly turned his  back on the girl, for he could not say this to her face.  "Dear Akane Tendo…it pains me to say this,  but I am no longer worthy of you."  Before the youngest Tendo could respond the self proclaimed "Blue  Thunder" dashed away, too ashamed to be in her presence any longer.</p><p>Ryoga looked at his friend's  fiancé.  "Who was that?"</p><p>Akane shrugged.  "He's a guy from school who Ranma beats up  everyday.  He claims to be in love with  me and he views Ranma as a threat."</p><p>"So this guy wanted to pick a  fight?"</p><p>The dark haired girl thought  about for a second.  "I don't think  so.  Kuno is a kendoist and doesn't use  hand to hand martial arts.  But juts now  he wasn't carrying a bokken."</p><p>Finally, after hanging out  the whole day downtown, Nabiki and Ranma had returned to the dojo.  It was about time for dinner.  The two seemingly got along very well.</p><p>As the approached the back  door Ranma summoned up all his courage in order to say the following.  "Hey Nabiki, today was fun.  You think that, you know, since this  engagement thing may be taken care of pretty soon that maybe we can go out on a  real date sometime."  It wasn't as if the  pony tailed martial artist hadn't asked a girl out before, but truthfully they  had been few and far between.</p><p>Nabiki smiled.  "Saotome, you couldn't afford a real date  with me."</p><p>Ranma was about to come up  with a snappy come back when all his senses suddenly became focused on a loud  explosion from a block or so away.  The  pony tailed martial artist turned toward where the blast had taken place.  He instantly realized that was a mistake as  he suddenly, yet briefly felt someone pass him from behind.  Turning back to where Nabiki had been  standing he found his fiancée's sister gone.</p><p>"So we meet at last, Ranma  Saotome."</p><p>Ranma lifted his head to see  Nabiki being held captive by a man dressed as a ninja (With a mask covering up  his face).  He held a long knife across  the girl's neck.  The Chinese clothed  fighter wouldn't be able to reach the newcomer fast enough to save his friend.  It became clear that the explosion was some  sort of distraction.</p><p>Ranma eyes narrowed. "Who the  hell are you?  Some rival who couldn't  take a loss?"</p><p>The ninja shook his  head.  "This is our first meeting.  You don't look like much.  Not worth the price that's on your head."</p><p>The pony tailed martial  artist would have gasped if he wasn't so angry.   "Bounty hunter?"</p><p>The ninja nodded.  "I have no name, but I'm a world class bounty  hunter.  Some people have called me  'Sin'.  You may call me this if you  wish."</p><p>"What a stupid name," Ranma  thought.</p><p>By this time Ryoga, Soun and  Akane come out to investigate the loud noise they had just heard.  What they found was Nabiki's life on the  line.  The girl was desperately trying  not to scream, fearing that this crazy person may get excite and slit her  throat.</p><p>Soun just lost it when he saw  his daughter in danger.  "What's the  meaning of this?"</p><p>"What are you doing with  sister?" Akane added, just as upset as her father.</p><p>Ranma was angry as well, but  he was trying to keep a cool head.  "If  you're after me why hold Nabiki?"</p><p>Sin smiled, though through  his mask it was hard to see it.  "You see  Ranma; I was told that you were an amazing enemy.  It's been a long time since I've had a half  way decent fight."  He drew Nabiki closer  to his body.  "I've seen you with this  one.  I know she's your woman.  If you want to save her then you'll need to beat  me.  Hopefully if you're angry you'll  give me a work out.   I'll take that head of yours, Saotome.  Count on it"</p><p>Ranma became deathly  silent.  He wasn't even breathing.</p><p>"Midnight, at the junkyard," the ninja continued.  "One minute later and I'll kill her.  Come alone."</p><p>With that Sin took off  leaving Ranma, Ryoga, and the Tendos stunned.</p><p>Soun, enraged, grabbed the  collar of the pony tailed martial artist.   "Ranma, what have you've gotten my little girl into?"</p><p>The young martial artist gave  the older man a sorrowful look.  "I'm not  sure myself, Mr. Tendo."  Ranma forced  himself free from Soun's grasp.  His aura  became visible.  It was like he was  burning with a terrible anger.</p><p>He didn't know who this "Sin"  person was, but he wouldn't forgive him for pulling innocents into a fight they  had nothing to do with.</p><p>In another part of Tokyo, inside in expensive pent house in one of the  fanciest hotels in Japan, a blonde gaijin woman was silently sipping a cup of  tea.  She smiled as she thought about her  love.  Oh how happy he would be when he  learned he she had come all the way to Japan for him.  She  would take him back with her to England, they would be married, and live happily ever  after.  Of course for this to happen  Ranma Saotome would have to die.</p><p>The moon would be full  tonight.  A moon lit night; that was  indeed the proper time to die.  Ranma  should be thankful.</p><p>High in the air, not terribly  far from Tokyo, a creature was also plotting the downfall of a  certain pony tailed martial artist.</p><p>"When I find those two  bastards," it thought.  "I'm gonna beat  the living shit of them, laugh, beat on them again, laugh some more, then toss  their bodies off the side of a cliff.   That'll teach them to mess with Pantyh…er, I mean me."</p><p>On the outskirts of Tokyo yet another person with a grudge against Ranma stood  over an unsuspecting city.  The young,  long haired martial artist had been preparing for months for the inevitable  meeting between himself and the devil who had caused him such pain.  Because of that monster he had truly seen  hell.  That is if he <i>could</i> see.</p><p>To be continued…</p><p>Author's Note:  Okay, I know I said that Chapter 2 sucked and  reviewers told me they thought it was good.   However I am certain that this chapter was as crappy as crap can be.  It's basically nothing more then a set up for  the next chapter so that's my excuse.  Anyway,  this chapter hopefully answered some of the points brought up in the reviews.  On the subject of Akane; of course Ranma is  stronger than her.  However Ranma's reaction  was the product of two things:  He got  cocky and sloppy.  Had he had taken it  seriously his arm wouldn't have gotten hurt.   Also In the manga and the anime when Akane gets really pissed Ranma  tends to get hurt regardless of how much stronger and faster than he is.  I decided to play around with that, though  I'm not sure where I'm going with it yet.</p><p>What's up with Kuno?  And Dr. Tofu?   Don't think about too much since I'm not going to explain it for a  while.</p><p>Don't expect to see those  random fighters that showed up for Ryoga's hide again.  Though Kabato the Blade may show up from time  to time.</p><p>Finally, I must say I'm very  happy to have gotten such great reviews for this story.  Thank you for your support!</p><p>Revision Note: Cleaned it up  a bit and cut out the subplot regarding Akane's hidden strength.  As of now that aspect of the story no longer  exist</p><p>Next Chapter:  The shit hits the fan.  Nabiki has been kidnapped.   Ranma  races off to find her, however two (Serious) rivals arrive just in time to mess  up the rescue plan.</p>
