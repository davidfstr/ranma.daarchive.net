</div>                Disclaimer:  Ranma ½  was created by Rumiko Takahashi.  I had  nothing to do with it.  Please do not sue  me; Money doesn't grow on trees, ya know!<p>However, the  original characters that appear in the story were created by me.  How do you like dem apples?</p><p>The sun had set hours  ago.  The moon was the only source of  light for the streets of Nerima.  On  these streets three women were currently tracking someone whom their people had  deemed the fiercest of enemies.</p><p>"This is the town, right  Lotion?" asked the fairly young pink haired girl who seemed to be the  leader of the group.</p><p>Her light, blue haired companion  simply nodded.  She was older than the  other two, who seemed to still be in their teens.  Lotion, as she was called, looked around 24 or  so.</p><p>The other girl, a short  blonde, looked back at her current leader.   Her fists were clenched and her face read of someone who had lost  everything dear to her.  "So when we  find him we kill him?"</p><p>The leader promptly slapped  the back of the head of her comrade.  "If  you recall, Elder Cologne gave us specific instructions to watch, not  engage.  You know what he's capable of,  Soap."</p><p>The blond lost her temple at  this.  "Of course I know!  I was there, damn it!  I saw what that monster did to our  sisters!  I swear by the ancestors that  I'll be the one to end his life!  Where  were you when he killed our friends and family?"</p><p>The leader didn't have the chance  to answer as she was cut off by Lotion.   "There he is."</p><p>Soap began looking around  furiously.  "What? Where?"</p><p>Lotion pointed to a nearby  roof top.  Running across was none other  then Ranma Saotome.  Not stopping to  notice the trio the pony tailed boy leapt unto the next roof in the direction  of the old junkyard.</p><p>The leader gasped.  "That's him?" She had expected a  brute of a man, not a handsome boy her age.</p><p>The older woman frowned when  she saw the girl's expression.   "Don't forget who he is and what he has done, Comb."</p><p>Comb's face became  stern.  "I know that.  We'll follow." Her eyes looked straight  at Soap.  "But we will not fight him.  Not yet."</p><p><b>Chapter 5</b></p><p><b>Underneath the Moon so Bright</b></p><p>A few hours earlier, at the  Tendo Dojo.</p><p>The remaining Tendos, Genma,  Ryoga as well as Ranma were all sitting at the dining room table.  Kasumi had prepared tea for them as they  discussed the abduction of Nabiki.  The  middle Tendo sister had been kidnapped by a bounty hunter who called himself  "Sin."  Despite the laughable title he  had given himself the man was seemingly a skilled ninja.  He had come to Nerima to find Ranma.  According to Sin, the pony tailed boy had a  price on his head.  Confusing Nabiki as  Ranma's girlfriend the ninja had taken her as some sort of motivator for the  boy to fight with all his power.</p><p>An hour had passed since  then.  Everyone had calmed down by now  (Much to Ranma's delight as he had become the victim of Soun's "Demon Head  Attack").  By now they had begun to  understand just what they were dealing with and started to formulate strategy.</p><p>Akane had been the first to  blame Ranma for this mess.  "What exactly  did you do to have a bounty put on your head?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head.  "Nothing, as far as I know.  But I've been around, you know.  Maybe I pissed off some rich guy and he put  out a bounty on me as a means of revenge."</p><p>Ryoga shook his head.  "We all know what really caused this.  Obviously Genma stole something, got caught,  and used Ranma as a bargaining chip.  Now  the guy wants to collect."  He put the  fat martial artist in an aggressive head lock.   "Spill it, old man!  Who did you  sell Ranma to?"</p><p>"It wasn't me, I swear,"  Genma choked.  "I don't remember selling  Ranma to any rich people!"</p><p>Ryoga strengthen his  hold.  "Aha!  So you admit that you've sold Ranma in the  past!"</p><p>"BE QUEIT, THE BOTH YOU!"</p><p>Both martial artists turned  to an irate Soun.  He had grown impatient  at their bickering.  "My little girl is  out there somewhere, crying in pain."</p><p>Soun-o-Vision</p><p>Sin: Now you're all mine!</p><p>Nabiki: Eek!  Stay away!</p><p>Sin: I'll have my way with  you and then kill you, just like in all those TV              dramas!</p><p>Nabiki: Daddy, where are  you?</p><p>Soun began wailing and  crying, seemingly losing his sanity at his own imagination.  He stood up and started running around the  house screaming Nabiki's name.</p><p>Kasumi gave Ranma a meek  smile.  "It would seem that Father will  not be helping you rescue Nabiki."</p><p>The pony tailed martial  artist shrugged.  "Sin said to come  alone, right?  I'll be going there on my  own."</p><p>Both Akane and Ryoga raised  an eyebrow at this.  The youngest Tendo  girl spoke first.  "What do you  mean?  I'm going too."</p><p>Ranma shook his head.  "I don't think so.  Sin may kill Nabiki if he sees that I came  with help.  Besides, you'd only get in  the way."</p><p>Akane nearly exploded.  "What?   I'm a martial artist too, ya know!"</p><p>"I know that, but I don't  want to have to worry about you too.  I  don't know how strong this 'Sin' guy is, but I'm confident that I can handle it  alone."</p><p>Akane wasn't really satisfied,  but she had calmed down.  "Your ego is  going to get you killed."</p><p>Ranma's trademark grin  appeared on his face.  "Ranma Saotome  can't be killed."  With that he stood up  and headed toward the stairs.  He stopped  suddenly and turned his head in the direction of Ryoga.  "That goes for you too."</p><p>The lost boy eyes widen.  "What?   Hey wait a second!"  He stood up  and dashed after his old friend, desperately praying he didn't get lost at this  crucial moment.</p><p>Ranma faced his mother's  sword, which sat upon the mantle he had set up in the guest room.  For what seemed like hours he simply starred  at it.  Finally he muttered in a soft  tone barely over a whisper "Not yet."</p><p>"What's the big idea telling  me I can't come?"  The words of Ryoga  Hibiki interrupted the pony tailed boy's train of thought.  He looked over at the door way to see the boy  standing there.  The bandana clad fighter  had gotten lost trying to follow Ranma but thankfully found the guest room of  the Tendo home relatively easy.  "I can  understand Akane; she's just a living target, but what about me?  We've done this kind of thing lots of times."</p><p>The Chinese clothed boy wore  a serious expression.  "I'm doing it  alone.  Your help is not desired.  I'll save Nabiki with my own two hands"</p><p>Ryoga eyes narrowed.  "Why are you making this so personal?  Do you love this chick?  Did you fall for her while you've been living  here?"</p><p>Ranma expression betrayed no emotion;  however Ryoga knew he had somehow touched the boy with what he said.  "It's not that," the pony tailed boy  responded.  "It's just that…I'm sick of  people getting killed because of me!  I  won't let anyone else die because I was too weak to save them!"</p><p>The lost boy finally  understood.  He shook his head in  disbelief.  "You still blame yourself for  Tenma."</p><p>Ranma could not hold back his  emotions anymore.  Tear began pouring from  his eyes.  "I couldn't save him.  He's dead because I was too weak to save  him.  Mom's dead because I couldn't save  her!  Everyone who I  care about die!"</p><p>Ryoga's face became  stern.  "First of all there was nothing  you or I could have done to save Auntie Nodoka.   Second of all there is no reason for you to mourn Tenma.  He wasn't even human!  He was a shadow, not a person!  Besides if he had lived he would've just  caused trouble.  If not  for us than someone else."</p><p>"Don't give me that!  He had thoughts and dreams just like anyone  else.  So what if he was born  differently?  So what if he was  misguided?  He didn't deserve to die!"</p><p>There was a long  silence.  Neither boy dared speak another  word; they simply starred at on another.   Finally Ranma spoke.  "I'm  going.  I'll be back soon with Nabiki."</p><p>Ryoga sighed, but stepped out  of the way.  His friend walked past him,  not saying a word.  The lost boy did  notice that Ranma was caring a bokken rather then his mother's sword.  He shrugged it off, not putting much thought  to it.</p><p>As the pony tailed boy  stepped out of his room he saw Kasumi standing out in the hallway, her head  lowered trying to hide her expression.   "Umm…I heard you two in there.   I'm sorry but I couldn't really help myself."</p><p>Ranma sighed, but kept  calm.  "Well there you go.  Tenma is someone I let die a year ago.  Does it sicken you to have a murderer living  in your house?"</p><p>The oldest Tendo sister  raised her head and met Ranma's gaze.  It  was the first time the pony tailed boy had really looked at the older girl's  eyes.  "I…I don't believe that you are  capable of such an act."</p><p>The Saotome heir starred  blankly at the girls, but didn't get a chance to respond as Kasumi  continued.  "I believe that you are a  kind person who wouldn't hurt someone unless you had to.  I've seen how you act around the house when  you think no one is looking.  You're in  constant suffering.  You're filled with  pain and regret.  These are not the  traits of a killer, Ranma."</p><p>The pony tailed boy showed no  emotions at Kasumi's words.  He simply  walked past her, not making eye contact again.   As reached the stairway the girl added "Please bring Nabiki home  safely."</p><p>Hearing this Ranma turned  back toward the girl.  He smiled warmly  and said "Don't worry."  With that the  young martial artist left the Tendo home.</p><p>Nabiki Tendo was not a fighter.  She had given up her father's art many years  ago.  She knew the very basics but  nothing more.  Though every few months  she would wish had kept at it.  Usually  this was when some jock refused to pay her money he had lost in some bet.  Had she been a strong martial artist she  could easily extort the money from the guy through violent means.  Today was one of the times she wished she  didn't forsake the Anything Goes School.   At that moment the Ice Queen was starring death right in the face and  she was totally defenseless against it.</p><p>They were at the junkyard,  just as the ninja called "Sin" had told Ranma earlier that night.  Nabiki found herself tied to a random piece  scrap metal as her kidnapper stood a few feet from her starring at the  moon.</p><p>She was growing  impatient.  "You know, this doesn't  really have anything to do with me.  I'm  not sure what you think you saw earlier but Saotome and I aren't  a couple."</p><p>Sin did not even look at  her.  "Regardless of whether or not you  believe that, Ranma Saotome seems to care about your well being.  The look in his eyes as I held you were  burning with rage.  I'm sure he'll give  me the fight I've been waiting for."</p><p>Nabiki kept her calm, though  she did momentarily wonder if what he said was true.  She decided, as a means to pass the time,  question him about the bounty he claimed was on Ranma's head.  "So why are you so hot to catch Ranma  anyway?  What's this bounty about?"</p><p>Sin surprisingly turned to  face his prisoner.  Though it was hard  for Nabiki to see through his black mask, the ninja was smiling.  "How well do you think you know your friend?"</p><p>She was about to answer  positively though she hesitated.  She  knew a good amount about Ranma, but there was still much he wasn't telling her.</p><p>Sin laughed when she didn't  speak.  "You may think that I am an evil  man for doing all this, however it is your friend who is the real monster.  Have you ever heard of the Amazon Tribe in China?"</p><p>A chill went up Nabiki's  spine as she nodded.  Ranma had told her  that an amazon had killed his mother.</p><p>"During the last two months  your friend has been dubbed the Demon of Joketsuzoku!  The unstoppable  powerhouse that single handily wiped out the amazons and burned their village  to the ground!"</p><p>That village had the same  name as the one Ranma had described to her.   Despite that she didn't buy it.   Ranma didn't seem to be the type of guy who  would (Or could for that matter) destroy a whole village.</p><p>Though he  did have a motive.</p><p>Sin turned his back on the  girl.  "It'd hard to believe that a  single man could defeat the entire amazon force alone.  I don't completely believe it myself.  None the less the surviving amazons shortly  after the attack offered their entire treasury to the warrior who could bring  Saotome down."</p><p>Sin paused a bit before he  went on.  "But the real reason I took the  job is because I want to test my skills.   In all my days training in the martial arts I have never had a rival who  could challenge me.  I became a bounty  hunter in the hopes of finding worthy foes.   Can Ranma give me that fight?"</p><p>Nabiki remained silent.  When she didn't respond Sin went on.  "In about one minute we'll find out.  He has arrived earlier than I told him too.  He must be anxious to fight."</p><p>In the distance, within the darkness,  a pony tailed shadow was quickly approaching</p><p>Meanwhile back at the Tendo  home things had become quiet.  Ranma had  left, Soun and Genma had drowned themselves in alcohol and Kasumi had gone on  as if things were normal.  She was  currently in her room.  Akane had decoded  this was the perfect time to sneak out to the junkyard.  Ranma didn't know it yet but he would need  her help (At least that's how Akane saw it).   The youngest Tendo sister had silently moved through the house without  being noticed.  "Heh, I would have made a  pretty good ninja myself," she silently whispered.</p><p>"Where am I now?" She heard a  familiar voice ask from within the darkness.</p><p>Both Ryoga and Akane found  themselves facing each other.</p><p>"What the hell are you  doing?" The both demanded.</p><p>"I'm going to help  Ranma!"  Both responded.</p><p>Ryoga started giggling.  "Yeah right.   How are you going to help Ranma when you can't even touch him in a  sparring match?"</p><p>Akane growled at what the  lost boy said.  "Well, what about  you?  From what Ranma told us about you  it would take you a week to find the junkyard!"</p><p>Both martial artists said  nothing for a while before they said in unison "Maybe we can help each other  out."</p><p>With that Akane began leading Ryoga down the  fastest route to the junkyard.</p><p>It wasn't hard for Ranma to  find the place.  He was early, but he  didn't feel that he needed to obey that jerk's demand.  He'd beat the snot out of the guy, rescue  Nabiki, and get home well before breakfast.</p><p>Upon arriving on the scene  Ranma saw that Nabiki had been tied up and, strangely enough, Sin was standing  out in the open.  The pony tailed fighter  was sure his opponent would try to get set up some sort of trap.</p><p>"You're early," Sin stated.</p><p>Ranma shrugged.  "Yeah well, I got a test in the morning and  can't stay out late tonight."</p><p>Sin frowned at the boy's  sense of humor.  "You should take this  seriously.  I am not a foe to be taken  lightly."</p><p>Ranma smiled his cocky  grin.  "Heh, you obviously don't know  Ranma Saotome."</p><p>The ninja pulled out dual a  long sword from seemingly nowhere and pointed it directly at the boy.  "I know you better then you think, Ranma the  Demon of Joketsuzoku!"  With that, Sin dashed at the boy such blinding  speed that Nabiki could not keep up with as she looked on.</p><p>The  pony tailed boy but however wasn't too impressed by this.  As the ninja kept slashing his weapon Ranma  easily dodge with little or no effort.</p><p>Sin  grew angry at this display.  "Don't  underestimate me!"  Ranma suddenly found  himself being attacked with too sword, both moving at much faster speed.   The Chinese clad martial artist was still  able to doge but this time he just barley managed to escape being sliced to  pieces by the ninja's attacks.</p><p>Ranma  was able to leap back giving himself some room.   At that time the boy had realized that his shirt and pants legs had been  torn.  Not only that, the Saotome Heir quickly  felt his beloved pony tailed with his hand finding it to have had its tip cut  off.</p><p>Sin  evilly laughed as his opponent became distressed over his inability to dodge of  the ninja's attack.  "Do you understand  now, Ranma?  Not only have I mastered the  art of the ninja, but I have also integrated the Hidden Weapon Style into my  fighting technique."</p><p>Nabiki  had suddenly become worried.  She had  assumed, just as Ranma had, that her sister's fiancé would easily dispense of  Sin; however it seemed that the ninja was too strong.</p><p>Both  Sin and Nabiki found themselves shocked to see Ranma laughing loudly.  "I admit 'Sin', you're better than I  thought.  But let's see how high and  mighty you are after I stop playing around."</p><p>With  that, the pony tailed boy suddenly vanished in a blur, appearing right behind  the ninja.  Sin had no time to react as  the boy delivered a swift kick to his back sending him crashing into a pile of  car parts.   The bounty hunter climbed  out from underneath the heavy mercenary, hurting badly, only to find Ranma  giving him the "victory" sign and smiling confidently.</p><p>The  ninja, enraged, leapt at the boy using the same technique as earlier:  A barrage of insanely quick sword  swipes.  This time Ranma was ready for  it.  He drew his bokken and surprisingly  was able to block each attack without even damaging the wooden sword at all.  Jumping over the last slash, the pony tailed  boy landed gracefully several feet from his opponent.</p><p>"C'mon,  I'm sure you can beat me if ya try harder," the boy mocked as he pointed his  bokken directly at the ninja.</p><p>Sin  responded by hurling a massive amount of knifes (Though oddly enough he did not  seem to have them a second ago) at the pony tailed martial artist.  Unfazed, Ranma managed to dodge them all with  little effort.  The bounty hunter had run  out of ideas.  He had sorely  underestimated his opponent and now there was almost to way to reclaim the  advantage.  So with nothing left to lose  he charged in an all or nothing attack.   Slashing, and kicking, punching and slashing, no matter what the ninja threw  he was either blocked or dodged.</p><p>Finally  after a while of dancing with his opponent, Ranma used his "V-Slash"  technique.  Sin was torn into, left alive  only because the sword used was only wooden.   That did not save him from being launched through the windshield of a  nearby car.  The fight seemed to be over.</p><p>Ranma  let out a sigh of relief.  He had been  bluffing with a good amount of his trash talk, but luckily Sin wasn't as strong  as he bragged either.  He looked over at  the captive Nabiki and gave her thumbs up.</p><p>"Don't  just stand there feeling good about yourself, Saotome! Untie me!" The girl  yelled.</p><p>Ranma  smiled at her.  "Aww, c'mon.  That was great!  Did you see how I manhandled that guy?"</p><p>"Indeed  I did, Ranma Saotome," a feminine, though familiar voice called out from the  shadows.  The pony tailed boy soon became  pale as he instantly recognized the voice who spoke to him.</p><p>A  girl, who couldn't be older than sixteen stepped from behind the car Sin had  been introduced too.  She was a  foreigner, with long blonde hair, and incredibly beautiful.  She wore a very expensive dress, not  something that one would find in the average clothing store.  Nabiki had noticed all of this and to her  this new arrival didn't seem like the typical fighter.  So why had Ranma suddenly become so worried?</p><p>The  boy in question was having trouble breathing properly.  "E…Emily Tisdale?  W-w-what the hell are  you doing in Japan?"</p><p>The  blonde smirked evilly.  "To kill you of  course, as well as rescue my beloved Ryoga from this filthy country's grasp."</p><p>Nabiki  made a quickly analysis of the girl's accent.   It seemed to be an English one, but she could have very well been  mistaken.</p><p>The  girl called Emily went on when she saw Ranma had not responded. "I'm sure you  have not been keeping track of the lunar cycle since you escaped me almost  three years ago.  Did you not realize  that tonight is a full moon?"</p><p>Ranma  had begun sweating bullets, but still had no reply for this seemingly old  enemy.</p><p>The  foreign girl gave the pony tailed martial artist a seductive smile.  "As you can tell I have not yet looked upon  the moon.  I thought we could look at it  together.  Don't be upset, Ranma.  You'll be able to die beautifully under the  moon's brilliant shine."</p><p>Ranma  looked at the girl with a pleading look, something Nabiki had not seen he boy  use as long as she had known him.  He was  not just afraid of this girl, he was terrified.   "Don't do it," the boy practically begged.</p><p>Emily  did not pay the plea any attention as she titled her head starring directly at  the full moon.  Ranma felt his heart  stop.   The Chinese clothed boy, as well  as Nabiki, could only watch in horror as the English girl began her terrifying  transformation.  Her figure grew into a  large mass of muscle, so large that she tore her clothing to shred.  At the same time her blonde hair and began to  change into a grayish color. The same hair began to cover her entire body.  Her facial features, once that of an  attractive human, had changed into a ferocious wolf.  It became clear to the middle Tendo sister  just why Ranma had been so scared.</p><p>"What  the hell is she?' Nabiki demanded in a panic.</p><p>Ranma,  who was also panicked, took a few seconds before he answered "Umm…she's a  werewolf."</p><p>Nabiki  had never believed in werewolves, or any of those stupid stories about monster  that lurk in the night.  Even though she  had met a boy who could change into a girl through a magical cure as well as a  man who changes into a mythical monster Nabiki's strong belief that creatures  such as vampires, zombies and werewolves were just silliness had remained  firmed.  Unless this was a dream, and she  severely hoped it was, than her belief system would need to be reexamined.</p><p>The  now transformed Emily smiled a hideous and toothy grin at the two.  She spoke in a monstrous tone.  "My dear Ranma, can I assume that that delicious  looking female behind you is your lover?   How fitting that I shall deny you your chance at love just as you have  denied me in the past.  I will not just  kill you, I shall break you and leave you helpless as I devour you girlfriend  before your eyes!"</p><p>With  that the werewolf leapt at the pony tailed fighter at a speed that left him  with little time to react.</p><p>Tatewaki  Kuno's mindset the last few days has been a mystery to all that knew him.  His sister Kodachi, who truthfully didn't  care too much for him, had taken notice of this.  Her brother had been spending the majority of  his time practicing in his private training hall.  All day every day the boy trained.  The martial art gymnast couldn't help but  wonder what had driven her brother to this.   She had heard that he had been embarrassed by losing in a kendo match  against a mysterious new student at Furinkan.   No doubt that had something to do with it.</p><p>Tonight  was the usual routine.  Rather than  sleeping, Kuno had chosen to practice.   He had not bothered to be quiet about it either.  This would cause Kodachi to investigate (Or  more accurately shut him up).</p><p>"Brother  dear, do you have any idea what time it is?" the girl asked tiredly.</p><p>Her  brother was quick to answer though did not cease practicing his forms. "Does  justice know night or day, sister?  Does  honor?"</p><p>Kodachi  rolled her eyes at her "Beloved" brother.   He fashioned himself a samurai, a warrior of justice and honor, and he  never stopped talking about the two.  It  annoyed the gymnast to no end.</p><p>"Really brother, all this over one loss.  Can you not go to bed now and resume your  delusions in the morning?"</p><p>Kuno's  eyes twitched.  He did not enjoy it when  his sister referred to him as delusional, especially considering the state of  her mind.  If there was one thing that  the kendoist sure of it was that Kodachi was horribly insane.</p><p>"Blue  Thunder" turned toward his sister and frowned.   "Be gone, I must continue my training."   He said no more to her and refused to even acknowledge her presence.</p><p>Kodachi  was annoyed at her brother's attitude but intrigued over the man who had caused  Kuno to develop such a mindset.  It  wasn't as if Tatewaki was plotting revenge, though she wasn't too sure what  went on in her brother's mind.  She  decided that she would like to meet this person who defeated her brother.</p><p>As  Kodachi exited the training hall another figure silently and stealthily made  his way in.</p><p>"Master  Kuno," the new arrival called out to employer.   His name was Sasuke, a faithful ninja servant to the Kuno clan.  "I was making my nightly rounds as usual when  I discovered something of interest to you."</p><p>Kuno  did not stop practicing, but motioned his Sasuke to speak.</p><p>"I  witnessed Ranma Saotome on his way running along the rooftops," the ninja  reported.</p><p>This got the kendoist' attention.  He  abruptly stopped his training and turned toward his servant.  "Saotome! Why would he be out running around  the city at this ungodly hour?"</p><p>Sasuke  continued.  "I followed him, as you had  instructed me to keep tabs on the boy should I see him.  He headed toward the old junkyard.  There was a warrior there waiting for  him.  A ninja in fact.  They seemed to be enemies.  Surprisingly Nabiki Tendo was there as  well.  There were also at least two other  parties in hiding, observing just as I was."</p><p>Kuno's  relatively small brain took a few minutes to process what he had just been  told.  Finally his face became  serious.  "Fetch me the Kuno family  blade."</p><p>As  the ninja left to does he was told Kuno smirked wickedly.  Someone would taste steel this night.</p><p>Nabiki  could not believe her eyes.  After seeing  all the fights Ranma had gotten into since coming to Nerima she was quite  certain the boy was invincible.  True he  was defeated by Ryoga, but just barley.   Any other opponent hadn't lasted that long once the pony tailed boy got  serious.  However now she was seeing  something she never thought would happen:   Ranma was being manhandled.  The  monster that had come to end the boy's life had been merciless.</p><p>Ranma picked himself up from the ground,  having been slammed into it painfully by Emily.   She had backed off, not wanting to end it just yet.  The pony tailed fighter was a mess.  His clothes had been ripped to shreds and he  was bleeding from various cuts and scratches that covered his body.  He also thought that his left shoulder might  be dislocated.</p><p>And  the fight was far from over.</p><p>The  monstrous Emily laughed (Or what would be considered a laugh in werewolf  tongue).   She could see that the mighty  Ranma Saotome didn't have much fight left in him.  "What's wrong, my dear Ranma?  Feeling a bit tired?  Perhaps you should lie down and rest."</p><p>"You  bitch!" Ranma screamed as he vanished in a blur.  He appeared right behind the werewolf and  attempted a kick on his unsuspecting foe.   However the girl turned monster had seen it coming and caught the boy's  foot before it could connect.  She began  swinging him above her head violently by the leg.</p><p>"Getting  dizzy, Ranma?"  Emily mockingly  asked.  "Then I, being the generous  person I am, will stop the spinning."   With that the beast of a woman tossed the pony tailed boy into a pile of  car parts.</p><p>Damaged,  but alive, Ranma climbed out from the junk pile.  He spat up a combination of vomit and blood.</p><p>The  wolf girl frowned at this display.   "Disgusting!  Have you people no  shame?  You shall pay for your vulgar  behavior!"  Emily dashed at the victim  with super human speed with the intention of finishing him off.</p><p>Ranma  over was not ready to die yet.  He drew  his bokken, which he had been saving.   "Stupid bitch, just go to hell!  V-SLASH!"</p><p>The  attack connected with the incoming monster.   The force of the blow caused her to fly backwards, however unlike most  of Ranma's other opponents Emily landed gracefully on her feet.  She felt her chest.  Sure enough the attack had created a "V" shaped  scar.  The wolf girl howled in rage.  "You scum!   I'll crush you!"</p><p>Ranma  suddenly found himself directly facing Emily.   Too weak and tired to move he was wrapped by the massive arms of his  opponent.  She began to squeeze the life  out of him.</p><p>Nabiki  Tendo, who had watched all of this, could do nothing to help him.</p><p>Not  too far from this scene, three amazons watched in shock as the man who  destroyed their village was slowly being crushed to death by a mere werewolf.  Was he holding back?  Or perhaps this man wasn't the same one.</p><p>In  either case the continued to watch, not wanting to risk the former.</p><p>Akane  and Ryoga had made it to the junkyard in relative ease (Though Ryoga kept  wandering off or walking in the wrong direction).  What they found there was not a comforting  sight.  Nabiki was tied up, Sin was no  where to be found, and Ranma was being held by a monster.</p><p>Akane,  not having seen such a creature before, was not only scared but confused as  well.  "What the hell is going on?  What is that thing?  That's not Sin is it?"</p><p>Turning  toward her companion she found herself shocked once more.  Ryoga's face was pale and was obviously  scared of his wits.  "It…it can't be her.  How did she track us down?"</p><p>Akane  confusion only increased when the lost boy said this.  "Ryoga, what's going on?  What is that thing?"</p><p>The  bandana clad youth closed his eyes as he remembered his first encounter with  that monster.  He and Ranma had barley  been able to escape with their lives that time.   "That's Emily Tisdale.  She's  werewolf, and totally insane.  I can't  explain it all right now, but to be honest Ranma most likely won't get out of  this alive."</p><p>The  youngest Tendo sister gasped at Ryoga's comment.  Was he serious?  Was Ranma truly going to die this night?</p><p>The  lost boy dashed toward the direction of the fight.  Not bothering to turn back at Akane he yelled  "Get Nabiki out of here and run.  This is  no place for you!"</p><p>With  that Akane was alone.  Shrugging off her  confusion as well as the danger she faced just being there the heir to the Tendo School raced toward where Nabiki  was being kept.  She hoped her older  sister had some answers.</p><p>Ryoga,  ignoring his hesitancy of hitting girls, ran toward the werewolf and delivered  a tremendous axe handle smash to the back Emily Tisdale.  This caused her to drop the battered  Ranma.  The werewolf girl turned toward  her assailant with the intention of ripping off his head, but found herself  pleasantly surprised when she saw it was her one true love.</p><p>"My  love," she said sweetly (As sweetly as possible anyway).  "I did not expect you to be here.  Please wait a moment while I kill Ranma, then  you'll be able to express your true feelings for me."</p><p>Ryoga  nearly lost his mind when she said that.   "You crazy bitch!  You think I'm  gonna stand around while you kill my best friend?  To get to Ranma you'll have to go through me  first!"</p><p>Emily  sighed at this.  Ranma's evil hold over  her love was strong.  "I see.  The spell he has over you is still in place.  You don't realize your love for me.  Well then I'll have to show you that you love  me.  If I have to do it by beating you  within an inch of your life than so be it!"</p><p>And so Ryoga began the fight  of his life.</p><p>The turn of events that had  just taken place was not totally unexpected for Nabiki.  Since Ryoga and Ranma were such good friends  it was obvious that the lost boy would arrive sooner or later.  But this creature had just torn Ranma up in a  relatively short time.  How much of a  chance does the lost boy have?</p><p>The Ice Queen's attention was  drawn away by the appearance of a familiar face.  "Hey sis," Nabiki's sister greeted as she  reached the spot where the middle Tendo had been tied down.</p><p>Akane found herself surprised  with Nabiki.  The girl usually had a cool  demeanor, one she never let slip no matter the situation.  However what the youngest Tendo found was a  Nabiki whose face was full of fear.   Akane didn't know what her sister had been through while she was here  but she made a silent promise that someone would pay for it tonight.</p><p>"Akane, what are you doing  here?" Nabiki asked her sister.</p><p>The dark haired girl tried  her best to give a reassuring smile.  She  quickly began untying the ropes "Rescuing you, of course.  I thought that was obvious."</p><p>Once free, Nabiki instantly  nearly fell over.  Luckily she was caught  by her sister.  Akane realized then just  how out of sorts her sister was.  "Was it  really that scary?"</p><p>Nabiki thought the question  was a bit odd.  She hadn't really been  scared. Sure, that girl turning into a monster was a bit weird and shocking;  but no worse than seeing Genma changes into a griffin.  "Of course not.  Way do you ask?"</p><p>"You've been crying," Akane  said simply.</p><p>The brown haired girl placed  her hand upon her check.  It was  wet.  She hadn't realized she had been doing  it but she had indeed been crying.  She  didn't understand why she had been doing so.</p><p>Akane interrupted the older  girl's thoughts by stating the obvious.   "It looks like Ryoga has drawn the thing away from Ranma.  We should probably take advantage and help  him."</p><p>Nabiki nodded.  She turned toward the pony tailed boy.  He was slowly trying to get to his feet,  using his bokken as a crutch.  When she  saw him bloody and battered the middle Tendo girls felt a warm liquid flowing  down her cheeks.  She then understood:  Her tears were for this boy, who had been utterly  destroyed by his opponent.  Her fear was  not for her own safety but for that of her would be rescuer.</p><p>"What's wrong with me," she  thought. "Why the hell am I crying over this guy?  It's his fault I'm in this mess in the first  place.  It's not like we're friends or  anything.  Sure maybe I feel a slight  attraction to him, but still…"</p><p>Nabiki would not have the  opportunity to find an answer to her question.   She and Akane headed toward the injured Ranma.  The boy was obviously hurt badly, but still  refused to stay down.  His tenacity was  to be admired.</p><p>Akane, upon reaching him,  offered her arm.  "Let me him you up."</p><p>Ranma refused the  gesture.  "I can get up on my own."</p><p>The youngest Tendo sister started  to become angry.  "I was just trying help,  you jerk!"</p><p>Nabiki rolled her eyes at her  sister.  "Akane, is this really a good  time for you to lose your temper?"</p><p>Akane complied and ignored  Ranma's statement.  However her curiosity  about the whole situation was still ragging.   She questioned Ranma on the status of Sin and the identity of the  monster Ryoga was fighting.</p><p>The pony tailed by this time  was standing up.  He spoke in an  exhausted voice.  "I took care of that  Sin jerk with out much effort.  That  thing Ryoga's fighting is a girl named Emily Tisdale.  She's this crazy chick from England.  She's from  this weird aristocratic werewolf family that has a lot of power and money where  she's from.  It sounds crazy but it's  true.  She's also a complete psycho who  thinks she's in love with Ryoga."</p><p>Nabiki raised an  eyebrow.  "Let me guess; you're in the  way so she needs to kill you."</p><p>Ranma nodded.  "She's too strong for me or Ryoga to take her  on alone.  I'll help him out."</p><p>Akane eyes narrowed at  Ranma's proposed idea.  "Don't be stupid,  you can barley stand.  How are you going  to fight?"</p><p>He got a chance to answer as  he was cut off by the sound of thunder bolts in the distance.  As if on cue a familiar kendoist suddenly  appeared from the shadows.</p><p>He smiled evilly.  "It would seem that Ranma Saotome has been  defeated.  The foe is stronger then what  Sasuke implied.  Not just a ninja but a  demon from the depths of hell itself.   Fear not Saotome, for your defeat shall be avenged!"  He drew a dangerous yet elegant looking  katana as thunder again boomed in the distance.</p><p>Everyone starred at the  kendoist in disbelief.  Ranma was the  first to speak. "Kuno, umm, not that I don't appreciate your help but don't you  kind of, you know, hate me?"</p><p>Kuno frowned hard.  "I bear you no love, this much is true.  However since our last battle I have begun to  respect you.  No warrior had ever fought  Blue Thunder to a draw in a battle of blades.   I have realized that the noble blood of samurais must flow through your  veins, as it does my own.  Until the day  where we cross swords again I shall protect you with my life!  I swear on the noble house of Kuno!"  With that the deranged swordsman walked  slowly but confidently toward where Ryoga and Emily were fighting.</p><p>It took Ranma five seconds  before what Kuno said sunk in.  "Hey wait  a second!  That wasn't a draw!  I beat your ass fair and square you jerk!"</p><p>The three watched the self  proclaimed "samurai" march toward what was certain death.  What exactly was going on in Kuno's head?</p><p>Ryoga was doing better than  Ranma had against Emily.  Normally  something like this would make the lost boy's already large ego grow even  bigger, however he was sure that the girl turned monster was holding back, not  wanting to seriously hurt her love.  Even  so the bandana clad martial artist was having trouble against his  opponent.  He was taking more blows than  he was landing and was positive that Emily hit harder than he did.</p><p>Despite his high stamina,  Ryoga had begun getting winded.  He  wasn't sure how long he could continue to fight.  Emily, noticing the boy's heavy breathing,  decided to take advantage of the situation.   She launched her fist in a slow but power manner in the direction of the  lost boy.  Luckily it the bandana clad  fighter was easily able to avoid the slow moving attack by leaping over  it.  However Emily had predicted  this.  While in the air Ryoga found  himself swatted painfully by the back of the wolf girl's hand.  The blow sent the boy crashing into a nearby  wall.  He fell to the ground painfully  leaving an imprint of him self where he landed on the wall.</p><p>Emily smirked bearing her razor sharp fangs.  "I think it's time to end this game, my  love.  I have no problems with breaking  you into pieces and bringing you back to England in a sack."</p><p>The lost  boy responded by picking himself up and using an offensive fighting stance.  The girl turned  monster shook her head.  Why was love so  difficult?  She never got an answer as  her thoughts were cut off by the around of fighting hitting nearby metal.  Loud thunder was accompanied by confident  laughter of a cocky kendoist.</p><p>Kuno smirked as the wolf girl  turned to face him.  "To think Ranma  Saotome was defeated by such a beastly looking demon."</p><p>Emily angrily growled at the  newcomer's statement.  "Beastly?  You dirty peasant!  How dare you refer to me as  beastly?"</p><p>Kuno felt his eye twice.  "So the monster speaks like a man.  Let's see if you can fight like one."</p><p>And so Tatewaki Kuno used his  incredible kendo skills to cut down the vile creature that had dared to face  him in combat.  Or at least that's how  the kendoist will most likely remember it as in his mind later.  In reality he was swatted away like a common  house fly before he could even draw his sword.   He landed several blocks away making his entire entrance completely  meaningless.</p><p>Ryoga however chose to use  Emily's momentary distraction to his advantage.   The bandana clad fighter slammed his fist into the ground with all the  strength he could mustered.  "DAIJISHIN  BAKUHATSU!"</p><p>The invisible ball of chi  created a path of destruction as it made its way toward the girl turned  monster.  The collision caught Emily off  guard, but even so (Much to Ryoga's shock) the wolf girl simply shrugged it off  rather than being knocked off her feet as was the intention.</p><p>Emily's eyes narrowed.  "That hurt a little."</p><p>Ranma, watching from the  sidelines, had had enough.  He tried to  move from where he was standing but quickly lost his balance.  He was caught by Akane.</p><p>"You're not in any condition  to help him," Akane reminded the boy.   "Leave it to me.  I'm sure she  couldn't take both Ryoga and me."</p><p>Nabiki lost her cool at her  sister's blind confidence.  "Akane, what  chance do you think you have if she just swatted Kuno away?"</p><p>Akane did not want to admit  that she there was nothing she could do to help.  Her pride as a martial artist was already  shaken with Ranma and Ryoga living under her roof, but nothing hurts a strong  fighter like the feeling of helplessness.   Especially when for a long time you had considered yourself the  best.  Ranma too was experiencing this  and he didn't like any better than his fiancée.</p><p>Ryoga was out of ideas.  He had put all his strength into that last  shot and was now pretty tired.  He  wouldn't last too much longer, but he'd be damned if he had to marry this  psycho bitch!</p><p>Just as he was about to try  an all or nothing suicide attack the lost boy suddenly found his left wrist bound  to some type of rope that was attached to a nearby pole.  Looking closer he recognized it as the unmistakable  material for pantyhose.</p><p>From the sidelines Ranma  nearly screamed.  How in the hell could  this get any worse?</p><p>Emily too had suddenly  stopped what she was doing.  She had  picked up a new scent.  Was there yet  another fool who wanted to stand in the way of true love?</p><p>"Stop right there, flea bag,"  a male voice from the shadow called out to the wolf girl.  On cue a boy, around the same age as Ranma  and Ryoga, stepped from his hiding place.   He wearing green Chinese style clothing and a cocky grin that made  Ranma's look modest.  He had a flask  attached to the sash around his waist.   "If anyone's gonna beat the shit outta that sucker punching bastard it's  me.  Now beat it before I call the  pound."</p><p>Emily shook her head.  Another asian fool who thought he could stand  up to her strength.  "This is getting  tiresome.  Who might you be, little man?"</p><p>The stranger lost his grin  and replaced it with a deadly stare.  "My  name is….not important.  What is important  is that I came all the here to kick this guy and the pony tailed guy's  ass.  I don't really care about puppy  dogs, so you can just get lost and leave him to me!"</p><p>Akane and Nabiki were now  starting to wonder actually how many enemies these two guys had.  Nabiki was the first to ask who this new guy  was.  Ranma simply answered "Pantyhose  Taro."</p><p>The Chinese martial artist's  face became filled with rage when he heard his name being used.  He turned toward the Saotome Heir and  screamed "Don't call me that, you pony tailed son of a bitch!"</p><p>Emily decided to play a little  mind game with this new challenger.   "Indeed I thought you Asian people had such ridiculous names before, but  to think that I'd meet someone named 'Pantyhose.'  Was you mother called 'bloomers' by any  chance?"</p><p>Taro lost his mind at this.  He grabbed the flask which he had been  carrying.  "That's it!  I'm going to take care of you first, Flea  Bag!"</p><p>By this time Ryoga had  managed to get free of the pantyhose he had been tied to and was quietly  sneaking away.  Seeing his friend leave  to scene Ranma decided that it would be a good idea to flee as well.  "There's only one way to get out of this  alive.  The Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts Final Technique."</p><p>"And what might that be?"  Nabiki asked curiously.</p><p>"Run away."</p><p>Had they had been in the right  mindset the Tendo sisters would have face  faulted.  Instead they compiled with  Ranma's suggestion and carefully snuck away from the scene.</p><p>After they made it outside to  the entrance Akane finally asked "What about that guy back there?  Was it right to leave him there?  I know he seems to be an enemy of yours but…"</p><p>The dark haired girl was cut  off by a very loud cry that sounded similar to that of an enraged cow.</p><p>Ranma shook his head.  "Don't worry, that guy is the perfect  sparring partner for that psycho."</p><p>The three spent a few minutes  searching for Ryoga before they gave up.   He seemed to have gotten lost somewhere after he left the scene.</p><p>Ranma assured the girls that  the moon would set before the fight ended and they wouldn't have to worry about  any unexpected werewolf guests for a while.   Despite that knowledge the three housemates were extremely careful as  they treaded back home, praying another enemy of Ranma's didn't show himself.</p><p>The three females who had  been watching the whole scene from the shadows were utterly confused.  Could this boy whom they had been following  truly not be the same monster who attacked their village?  Between the three of them there was no way  they could verify until it was too late.   They would wait for Elder Cologne to arrive in Japan</p><p>Kasumi had been trying to go  on as if it was business as usual but after realizing that Akane had snuck out  of the house she had become extremely worried.   Both her sisters were out there somewhere and she could not help  them.  All she could do was wait for Ranma to return with hopefully both her sisters in  the dinning room.</p><p>The sounds of the back door  opening caused the eldest Tendo to sister to stand up and quickly race toward  the back of the house.  Sure enough  Ranma, being helped by Akane, stood in the doorway along with Nabiki.  All of Kasumi's fears subsided.</p><p>Ranma cheerfully smiled at  the older girl.  "I'm back."</p><p>Kasumi warmly smiled at  him.  "Welcome back."</p><p>Sin climbed out of the car  that Ranma had caused to crash into.  He had  miscalculated his opponent and became too confidant.  The ninja looked around.  It was morning and the battle was long  over.  However the area looked like a war  zone.  He knew that it wasn't just from  the quick fight he and his pony tailed bounty had engaged in.</p><p>He shrugged it off.  It wasn't important anyway.  As the bounty hunter struggled to his feet he  quickly realized he was not alone.</p><p>"That was pathetic.  I had heard that one of the best bounty  hunters in the world had taken the job to bring in Ranma Saotome.  I can't believe that that was your very  best."</p><p>Sin found himself starring at  a young Chinese boy, with long hair and back robes that just screamed cliché  villain.</p><p>The boy continued.  "I myself want to see Ranma dead.  However I know better than anyone that his  power is too great to defeat him in a straight fight.  I've recently gained great strength myself  and I still do not believe myself strong enough to defeat that monster.  Perhaps if I had an ally…"</p><p>Sin was beginning to catch  on.  "I see.  I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have a little  help."</p><p>The boy smiled wickedly.  He extended his hand.  "My name is Mousse, a former amazon."</p><p>The bounty hunting ninja  raised an eyebrow.  "Ummm,  why are you asking that car bumper to shake you hand?"</p><p>Mousse quickly put his  glasses on only to find he had been talking to car parts.</p><p>To be continued…</p><p>Author's Note:  Oh man, it took me forever but I finally  finished another crappy chapter to my overly crappy fic.  Many factors delayed this chapter, but I  mainly blame the fact that Christ break gave me so much free time that I didn't  know how to properly use it.  Anyways  Chapter five featured the introduction of some new characters as well as steer  this fic toward the main plot.  No  killing this time, but I warn you now; don't get too attached to any character  in this story.  I'm perfectly willing to  kill anyone off with out a moments notice.</p><p>Who is this Emily  Tisdale?  What did Ranma and Ryoga do to  Taro to make him so damn pissed?  What's  up with Mousse?  And more importantly did  Ranma really attack and successfully defeat the amazon nation?  Regardless, in the next chapter many many  many questioned will be answered including the one that has been asked since  chapter one: Who (Or what) the hell is Tenma?</p><p>Revisions Note:  Mostly cleaned it up. Altered some sentences  as well.</p><p>Next Chapter: Confronted by  an angry Tendo clan, Ranma is forced to disclose most of the information  regarding his travels.  This will include  the identity of Tenma!  Meanwhile Nabiki  tries to figure out her feelings for the pony tailed boy while others plot his  downfall.</p>
