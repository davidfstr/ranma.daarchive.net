</div>                Disclaimer:  Ranma ½ was created by Rumiko Takahashi.  I had nothing to do with it.  Please do not sue me; I have little or no  money.<p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><b>Arrival</b></p>Bringing Ranma from China<p>-  Saotome</p><p>"Oh  how I've waited for this day," Soun Tendo said as he clutched the postcard from  his old friend, tears of joy flowing from his eyes.  "The School will be secure!"  He quickly stood up and ran off to call his  daughters.</p><p>Meanwhile,  in the pouring rain, a certain pony tailed figure slowly walked along side a  larger figure covered in a black cloak thus making it impossible to tell what  was through it, though one could see its feet which in reality weren't feet at  all but fairly sharp looking talons.  The  two didn't seem to care what people thought of them.</p><p>"Damn  it Pop," the figure yelled.  "How could  you pick out a fiancée for me without asking?"</p><p>"[It  was you mother's idea]" the panda wrote on a wooden sign.</p><p>"You  expect me to believe that?"  The figured  demanded.</p><p>"[Okay,  maybe it was my idea]" the sign said.   The mysterious figure turned it over to reveal more writing.  "[But it's still a matter of family honor]"</p><p>"Whatever,"  the figure muttered.  "At least let me  meet this chick."</p><p>"[I'm  sure you two will fall in love]," the next sign said.</p><p>"Just  like you were sure about the Neko-ken, right?" the figure stated.</p><p>"[He  learned it, didn't he]?" the next sign said.</p><p>"You  have a lunatic's logic, pop," was the response.</p><p>The  rain soon stopped, giving the smaller figure to find some hot water.  None for Genma of course.  He deserved to be stuck in his cursed form  for a while longer.</p><p>"Fiancé?"</p><p>"That's  right," Soun assured his daughters.  "To the son of a very good friend of mine."</p><p>The  Tendo sisters all remained silent for several minutes; however their various  expressions did the talking for them.   Kasumi's face was filled with annoyance.   She was obviously disappointed that her father would make a decision this  large without them, though it didn't surprise her one bit.  Her younger sister Nabiki expressed  curiosity.  She was the only one who  seemed to look forward to this at all.   Perhaps she wanted a little love in her life, or perhaps she hoped that  the boy in question had a large bank account.   Akane, however, was furious beyond belief.</p><p>The  youngest daughter in question angrily stood up.   "How could you, dad?  Picking a  fiancé without even asking us first?"</p><p>"Calm down, sis," Nabiki requested.  "He may be real cute.  Right, daddy?"</p><p>"How  old is he father?"  Kasumi asked.  "Younger men bore me."</p><p>"Now  that you mention it, I have no idea," Soun realized.  "I've only met him once while he and his  family were passing through Tokyo during his training  mission.  Though I thought he was very  cute for ten-year old boy."</p><p>His  daughters remained silent for they did not know how to react to their father's  confession that he thought that a ten-year-old boy was cute.  Luckily the awkward silence was broken by the  sound of the doorbell.</p><p>Soun  leapt happily toward door.   "That must  be him."  Upon opening it, he came face  to face with a pony tailed boy, wearing a long sleeve red Chinese shirt and  black pants.  His blues eyes and handsome  smile would have any female melting in the palm of his hands.  He was followed by the hulking cloaked  figure.</p><p>"You  wouldn't be...?"</p><p>"Ranma  Saotome," the boy greeted.  "Heir of the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial  Arts."  He gave a bow.  Soun respond with a large hug that nearly  killed the boy.</p><p>"I'm  so happy to see you," Soun cried as he blocked Ranma's air passage.</p><p>"Can't...breathe..."  Ranma tried to say.</p><p>"I've  waited so long for your arrival," Soun added, not hearing, or maybe even not  caring to hear, Ranma's pleas.</p><p>At  this point the young martial artist had begun to turn blue.  "World…going…black…"</p><p>Kasumi  put a hand on her father's shoulder.  "I  think you're killing him, father."</p><p>"Oops,"  Soun yelped as he dropped the boy.</p><p>"[Hello  old friend]" the near giant wrote on a sign.</p><p>"Ah,  Saotome my friend," He examined Genma more closely.  "You've been working out a bit over the years  it seems."</p><p>The  cloaked visitor responded by removing his hood, revealing a vicious looking  falcon head, complete with evil looking bloodshot eyes.</p><p>"Holy shit!" Nabiki screamed totally dropping her Ice Queen exterior.  It was understandable.  It was a monster after all.</p><p>"He's  so cute," Kasumi commented.</p><p>"What  the hell is that thing!"  Akane demanded  at Ranma.</p><p>"Don't  mind him, he's just some pet I got while I was training in China," Ranma assured them.</p><p>"[I  resent that!]," stated a sign the birdman was suddenly holding</p><p>"That's  a well trained pet," Nabiki commented, once again in her cool demeanor.</p><p>The  moment of fear passed once the newly arrived Ranma assured them there was no  danger.  Soun once again hugged the boy  and expressed his happiness at Ranma's arrival.   The pony tailed youth seemed a bit annoyed with the Soun's "advances"  but still acted as polite as he could.   Kasumi silently fumed over discovering Ranma was a bit younger then  her.  She would of course fulfill family  honor if it come down to it, but hopefully one of her sisters would step up to  the plate and agree to marry the boy.   Nabiki had noted that in fact he was very cute, however she wasn't about  to marry a guy based something as shallow as looks.  It all depended on his the size of his wallet.</p><p>Akane  was just plain pissed.</p><p>"So  Ranma, when will your father be joining us?"   Soun asked.  Before Ranma had a  chance to respond, the elder Tendo added, "Oh that's right.  Your mother also traveled with you, did she  not?  Will she be joining us as well?"</p><p>Ranma's  face darkened.  He slightly lowered his  head.  "No, she won't," he said  simply.  Soun nodded.  He wasn't sure what the boy had meant by that  but he did note the bitter and slightly sad tone of his voice.</p><p>Akane  was still upset about this whole situation, however if there was one thing that  helped vent her anger it was practicing in the dojo.  And since this Ranma person was suppose to be  a fighter perhaps she could show him why they call her the best martial artiest  in Nerima.</p><p>"Hey,  wanna spar?" Akane asked the boy.  He stared at her with a confused look.  Annoyed at this boy's obvious stupidity Akane  added "You study karate, right?  Let's go  into the dojo and have a little match."</p><p>Ranma  still looked confused, but nodded and followed her toward the dojo.</p><p>Once  they were out of the room the "Well Trained Pet" turned to Kasumi.</p><p>"[Hot water please.]"</p><p>The  two teens soon found themselves opposite sides of the Tendo dojo about  five-minutes later.</p><p>"I  should warn you," Akane stated, "I'm considered the best martial artist in  Nerima, but don't worry.  I'll go easy on  you."  Sure it was easy to say that, but  trying to hold back on a boy was hard.   It just felt so good to beat on those immature idiots.  She simply silently promised not to kill  him.   Maybe.</p><p>Ranma  quickly identified that the stance Akane was taking was of the Anything Goes  Style; however it was a bit different from his own school.  Not surprising.  When his father told him this family  practiced their style he had assumed it would be slightly diverse.  Probably inferior as well.</p><p>"Are  you ready?"  Akane asked.</p><p>"Yeah,  attack me from any angle," Ranma replied smiling.</p><p>"Cocky  bastard," Akane thought to herself.   "He's not even taking a stance.   Oh well, I'll teach him not to take me seriously."</p><p>The  Tendo girl dashed at the pig tail boy with her fist however she noticed that he  had hit only air.  Turning around quickly  she saw the boy behind her, standing smugly.   How could that be?  No one's that  fast.</p><p>Once  again she charged at the boy, this time concentrating on his position.  She attempted a kick to his head, however she  misses.  Ranma in fact had only slightly  tilted his head to the left to avoid it.   If he had been an inch more to the right she would have connected.  She repeatedly tried to land a blow, but the  pony-tailed boy effortlessly avoided every time.</p><p>"Damn,  is he reading my moves?" Akane wondered.</p><p>Ranma  smiled slightly "She's got a lot stamina," he thought  to himself.</p><p>"This time for real!"  Akane yelled  as she charged the pony tailed martial artiest.   Direct hit!  She punched right  through his head.  Wait a minute, right  through his head?  Akane nearly tripped  when she saw the Ranma she punched began to blur, and then fade away.  Was it an illusion?  Before she could react she found herself  being thrown from behind landing and denting a wall of the dojo.  She fell to ground in a painful thump.</p><p>Ranma  bowed to his opponent.  A large grin  appeared on his face.  "Victory!"  He acknowledged.  "That was my Zanzouken technique."</p><p>"Y-y-you,"  was all Akane could say.  Ranma was so  fast he had left an after image of himself.   But that wasn't possible, right?</p><p>"Wow,  that was really easy," Ranma stated, still smiling.  "The standard of martial arts in this town  must be pretty low."</p><p>"What  did you say!" Akane yelled angrily.  The  nerve of this jerk.  How dare he insult  her like that!</p><p>"I  said your not that great of a martial artiest," Ranma repeated.  "Or at least your not nearly as good as I am,  but then again, who is?"</p><p>He  didn't even see the mallet that Akane used to hit him.  She stormed out of the dojo, muttering  something about losing to a boy, leaving Ranma in a heap on the floor.</p><p>Picking  himself up and dusting himself off Ranma sighed.  Akane was pretty easy to upset, though he did  realize that he had been pretty mean to her.   "This will never work."</p><p>"Oh,  hello Ranma," Kasumi said to the pony-tailed boy as walked into the kitchen.</p><p>"Hi,"  Ranma replied cheerfully.  He realized  just then he didn't know her name.</p><p>Seeing him begin to sweat, Kasumi gave  a reassuring smile.  "My name is Kasumi."</p><p>Ranma  nodded and extended his hand.  "Well,  nice to meet you Kasumi.  Hey, do you  think I could use your bathroom to wash up?"</p><p>"Of  course Ranma," Kasumi answered, her friendly smile never leaving.  "As I understand it, you'll be staying here  with us for a while, so please treat this as your home."</p><p>"Thanks  Kasumi," Ranma acknowledged as he headed upstairs.</p><p>"What  a nice boy," Kasumi said to her self as she continued doing dishes.</p><p>A  bit later, Ranma found himself soaking in the bathtub, considering his  options.  There had to be some way out of  this engagement.  He wanted an  adventurous life of training in the art.   Wandering down mysterious roads.   Testing his skill as well as the will to survive.   He didn't want to be stuck in some  preadolescent marriage.  So what if the  trip to China had just one disaster after  another, it had been an adventure.  His  skill had greatly improved in the two years he spent there.  He'd love to go back and face his old rivals  there to prove his superiority (As if he needed to prove it, he was Ranma  Saotome after all.  Of course he's  superior).</p><p>Sadly  there didn't seem to be anything he could do.   He'd be damned if he were going to back out of family honor.  It simply wasn't manly, and he knew if his  mother were there she'd kill him on the spot.   In fact she'd most likely force him to do it himself.  The pony tailed martial arts expert sighed to  himself in a deep silence.  He could  simply go with the flow, marry one of those girls, settle down and pretend to  be fulfilled in life.  Or he could just  say screw it, take off now and lose his honor.</p><p>Some choice.  Imprisonment  or risk of being a ronin.</p><p>Oh  well, things could be worse.  He had  managed to meet the Tendos as himself and not his cursed form.  He'd simply explain about the curse  later.  Maybe those girls would get  disgusted and break the engagement.   Unless they were into to that perverted stuff.  That Akane may swing that way.  She seemed a bit too macho to be a regular  boy-dating chick.  Realizing that he was  just delaying the inedible, Ranma stood up from the bath.</p><p>Just  as the door opened and a very naked Akane Tendo steeped through.</p><p>"..."  Ranma said to the intruder.</p><p>"..."  Akane wisely replied.  She quickly rushed  out the door, slamming it behind her.</p><p>The younger Saotome buried his face into his  hands.  "That's just great."  The horrible scream he heard outside the door  did nothing to calm his nerves.</p><p>Downstairs,  two old friends (Both humans by the way) sat silently in the dark, though tears  only flowing from one's eyes.</p><p>"So  that's the story," Soun commented.  "My  heart weeps for you, Saotome."</p><p>"Don't  cry for me, Tendo," Genma responded.  "My  curse does nothing save for increases my already large arsenal of fighting  ability.  I can even fly now."</p><p>"But what of you son?"  Soun asked.</p><p>"Nothing  seems to phase Ranma these days," Genma assured  him.  "I believe his mother's death  affected him in seemingly positive ways.   He is even more dedicated to the art, and holds honor above all else."</p><p>"He  seems like a perfect husband for one of my girls," Soun sighed happily.  "The schools will be united at last."</p><p>"Indeed,  Tendo," Genma agreed.</p><p>The  sound of a screaming youth interrupted their friendly conversation.</p><p>The  father of the Tendo sisters gasped.   "That's Akane!"</p><p>Some  time later, each member of the Tendo clan and the Saotome clan sat around the  dinning room table in order to discuss the engagement.</p><p>Ranma  and Genma sat across the Tendos, Akane giving Ranma a dirty look every once and  a while.  It wasn't her fault he had  angered her so badly she didn't notice the occupied sign on the bathroom door.  She bet that pervert took a good long look at  her body.</p><p>"As  you may or may not have guessed, this man is my old friend," Soun started.</p><p>"Genma  Saotome," the older Saotome introduced.   "You've already met my son, Ranma."</p><p>"As  you know, one of you will marry Ranma to fulfill a promise made years ago in  order to secure the Anything Goes Style of Martial Arts," Soun explained.  His face darkened.  "However..."</p><p>"...However," Genma picked up.  His  face too was filled with pain and sorrow.   "Our experience in China has left Ranma different  from other boys his age."</p><p>"Yeah,  he's a lot more perverted," Akane mumbled.   No one seemed to hear her comment.</p><p>Genma  rubbed his chin, seemingly in deep thought "How shall I explain?" He wondered  aloud.  "I know!"</p><p>With  that said, Genma attempted to toss Ranma into the koi pond in the back yard.  Too bad for him Ranma saw it coming and  easily countered the attack.  It was  Genma who ended up in the pond.  Then  something a bit different rose from it.   An 8'0" foot tall monster with a falcon's head and a furry muscular body  (Almost as if it were a lion's body complete with a tail), massive arms and  legs with razor sharp claws and talons adding its dangerous nature.  It featured large wings on its back as well.</p><p>"It's  that cute creature we saw earlier," Kasumi stated.</p><p>"I  ask again: What the hell is that thing?" Akane again demanded of Ranma.</p><p>'I  wonder how much those talons are worth on the black market,' Nabiki thought to  herself.</p><p>"It's  a griffin," Ranma explained to Akane. "A mythical creature  with the body of a lion and the head of a bird."</p><p>"A Griffin?  Why is your father a griffin?" Akane  asked.  She didn't even know Griffin's had been real.</p><p>"Cause  he was dumb enough to go to Jusenkyo," Ranma  mocked.  He was answered by being  splashed by bucket of water that was obviously sent by Genma-Griffin.</p><p>"[Your  one to talk, 'son']" Genma-Griffin responded.</p><p>Everyone  was now staring at the cute red head girl who had replaced Ranma.</p><p>"He's  a girl now," Kasumi noted.</p><p>"He's  a bigger pervert then I realized!" Akane gasped, shocked at the change.</p><p>Nabiki  gave her father a sarcastic look.  "You  sure have some strange friends, daddy."</p><p>"They  weren't always like this," Soun explain. "It was the result of a dangerous  training exercise in China."</p><p>A  kettle of hot water later...</p><p>"Ah  yes, it was about two months ago," Genma began his tragic tale.</p><p>"The  trip to China was to be the final stretch  of a ten year training trip in which I was to teach Ranma the most advance  styles of martial arts known to man. We spent two years there, during which,  Nodoka was tragically taken away from us."   He paused for emphasis before continuing.  "In any case, we continued on, the path of  martial arts being filled with pearl after all.   It was then we reached a place called Jusenkyo..."</p><p>Flashback</p><p>"Here  sirs, is Cursed Ground of Jusenkyo," their Chinese guide explained to them.</p><p>"Hey  pal, this wouldn't have happened to be the place where people turn into animals  and stuff."</p><p>"That's  nonsense Ranma," Genma remarked.  "Where  did you pick up such rubbish?"</p><p>"Aiya, is  very true," the guide stated.  "Most customer not listen to my tragic story though."</p><p>"Each  spring is cursed.  If someone falls in  the spring then they take the body of whatever drowned there last," Ranma  interrupted.  He then surprised the guide  by adding in almost perfect Chinese " Unlike that fat fool, I read the  catalog."</p><p>With  a look of relief the guide responded "You seem to be much wiser then the  usual foreigner who comes here." The guide responded looking directly at  Genma.  "It's not too often a  customer actually knows anything about this evil place or even speaks  half-decent Chinese."</p><p>"That's  all a lot of foolishness," Genma said sternly.   He hadn't caught any of the Chinese but he did hear them mention the  springs being cursed.  "There are no such  things as curses."</p><p>"Sure  pop, whatever," Ranma said lamely.  "I  still ain't going up there to train."</p><p>Genma's  eyes shifted.  "What's wrong boy, are you  a coward?"</p><p>Annoyed,  Ranma glared at his father.  "Pop, just  forget about this place.  Let's just skip  it and go back to Japan while we still can."</p><p>"Oh,  I see now."  Genma gave his son a wicked  smile.  "You're afraid if we spar here  you'll be defeated easily.  Perhaps your  skill isn't as unmatched as you'd like to think."</p><p>That  did it.  No one questioned the skill of  Ranma Saotome.</p><p>"Let's  finish this once and for all," Ranma yelled, his eyes blazing with fury.  They both leapt onto the bamboo poles that  were attached to the various springs.</p><p>"Sirs, what you doing?" The guide was panicking.  These two knew the dangers, but had still  gone on to test their luck.  Ranma noted  the guides concern, so he gave him a confident smile.  Of course Ranma had no intention of falling  into a spring, but it would certainly be fitting for his father to fall into  one himself.  Like Spring of Drowned  Panda or something.</p><p>Genma  attempted to get the first kick in, but the much faster Ranma easily countered  and knocked his father into the spring below.</p><p>"Hey  pop, did you change into a goat or what?" Ranma asked his father.  Genma responded by leaping out of the water,  now with the form of a monstrous griffin.   It perched itself one the pole closest to Ranma.</p><p>The  younger Saotome let out a fearful yelp at the sight of his father's new  form.  "W-W-W-W-What is t- t-t-that?"  Ranma demanded of the guide.  He  certainly wasn't expecting something like that to come out of the water.</p><p>"That  was spring of Drowned Griffin.  Very  tragic tale of Griffin who drown there 2,800 year  ago."  The guide paused before  adding.  "Well, that Griffin attack many villages and  kill many people.  I guess it not tragic  that it drown there."</p><p>Ranma  didn't hear the guide's story as the giant monster that used to be his father  knocked the boy straight into another random spring.</p><p>"Oh,  too bad, you fall in spring of drowned young girl.  Very tragic tale of girl who drowned there  1,500 year ago.  Now you have body of  young girl.  And you seemed so cautious  too.  Oh well, I still get paid, yes?"</p><p>Again,  it was doubtful that Ranma heard the guide as he was busy screaming due to his  sudden change of gender.</p><p>End  Flashback</p><p>"The  cursed ground of Jesenkyo," Soun said once the story was completed.  "For years its true horror was shrouded in  mystery, but now..."   Ranma shuddered at  the memory.  One of several he wished he  didn't have.</p><p>The  pony tailed boy in question suddenly stood up.   "I warned you pop!" He angrily grabbed his father's collar.  He really felt like killing Genma right now.   "I told you it was cursed, but did you  listen?   No! You just had to see for  yourself, didn't you?"</p><p>Genma  responded by tossing the off guard Ranma into the pond.</p><p>"Ranma,  you sound like a girl!" The elder Saotome yelled.  "Weren't you prepared to lay down your life  for the sake of the art?"</p><p>"My  life yes," the now female Ranma yelled from the pond.  "My manhood is another story!"  She suppressed the urge to splash her father  with some water.  Genma would only become  much stronger and gain flight ability.   Ranma simply climbed out of the pond, raced back at her father and  punched him extremely hard on the head.</p><p>Soun  interrupted the fight between the Saotomes.   "So when doused with cold water you turn into a girl."  He added to his reasoning by pouring a kettle  of hot water on Ranma-chan.  "But hot  water changes you back into a boy."</p><p>The  now male Ranma twitched in pain from the water he was given.  "H...Hot water, not boiling!"  Soun responded by chuckling at the whole  situation.</p><p>"Your  problem isn't so bad," Soun stated as he patted the boy on the back.  He turned to his three daughters.  "My oldest daughter Kasumi, she's 19.  My middle daughter Nabiki, she's 17.  And my youngest daughter Akane, she's  16.  Pick anyone you like, and she's your  fiancée."</p><p>All  three girls began to sweat.  True enough  when the handsome boy who arrived at the Tendon's doorstep a few hours earlier  the prospect of marriage didn't seem so outrageous.  However now that they learned he changed  genders marriage with him seemed a bit...odd.</p><p>"Akane  would be the best choice," Kasumi mentioned.   Nabiki heartily agreed.</p><p>"Sure,  she's always talking about how she hates boys," the middle girl added.  She looked directly at her little  sister.  "Well, you're in luck Akane,  since Ranma's half girl."</p><p>"Me!"  Akane gasped.  She suddenly became very angry.  "Marry that pervert freak!"</p><p>"Who you calling a pervert!"  Ranma  bellowed.  He didn't like being insulted  on things that weren't true.</p><p>"You  saw me in the nude, you pervert!"</p><p>Ranma's  anger calmed down.  This girl was  obviously only insulted her because she was a bit confused.  He'd simple would have to explain the  situation.  "But you walked in on me,  right?"</p><p>"Yeah,  well, its different then when a girl sees a guy," Akane responded.  She didn't really buy that excuse, but she'd  be damned if a boy won an argument with her.</p><p>"This  is all just a misunderstanding," Ranma replied.   "I saw you naked by mistake, you saw me naked by mistake.  No one's a pervert here"</p><p>"Oh  yeah, well you're still a pervert," Akane growled.  "Normal people don't change genders."</p><p>Their  fathers both laugh happily at their exchange of words.  "They're the perfect couple already."  Genma noted.</p><p>"He's  a couple by himself," Akane replied.</p><p>Ranma  eye twitched a bit at that comment, but he said nothing.</p><p>"I'm  sure Ranma is a nice boy once you to know him," Kasumi assured Akane.</p><p>"He's  a jerk, a pervert, and an egotistic bastard," Akane growled.</p><p>"Hey,  I'm still here you know," Ranma said realizing he had been forgotten.  "You're not exactly a prize yourself you  know!"</p><p>Akane  at this point wasn't really thinking with her whole bran, just the parts that  controlled anger.  "What's that supposed  to mean?"</p><p>"Let's  just say that tomboys with rage problems ain't exactly on my 'To Marry' list!"</p><p>Once  again Ranma failed to notice the large object wielded by an angry Akane.  Had he paid attention the pony tailed boy  might have just shut up instead of going on and on about Akane's bad  qualities.  A good table shot to the head  on courtesy of the youngest Tendo was enough to get him to finally stop.  And lose consciousness.</p><p>Genma  just stared at the pile of flesh and wood that was once his son.  "He had that coming."  The others agreed.</p><p>Ranma awoke early the next morning in the guest room off  the Tendo home.   The sun had not yet  risen.  The pony tailed boy rubbed his  head.  He was still in pain from the  beating he had received from Akane.   Kasumi had later assured him that she was a sweet girl. She could be  right.  Akane could have been the nicest  girl in the world, but the fact was he didn't care.  He wasn't going to marry her or her sisters  no matter what.</p><p>The boy yawned as he began to stretch.  He didn't sleep well these days.  He's only get a few hours at night.  It was just as well; he hated sleeping.  His dreams were always nightmares.  Always the same one.  His mother coming back from the dead  questioning his manhood, and it always ended with familiar face asking Ranma  why he let him die.</p><p>The  pony tailed martial artiest shrugged the feeling of dread off, and stood up  from his futon.  He looked around his new  room.  He hadn't decorated much, save for  putting his mother's katana on a mantle.</p><p>"One  day Ranma, this sword will be yours," she had told him often.  He'd seen many swords over the years, but his  mother's "Fire Soul Blade" was the best made by far.  He had trained in the art of kendo almost all  his life and had never seen a finer weapon.   He greatly respected this piece of metal.  True, he had learned to love un-armed combat,  but in his heart he held a special place for swordplay.</p><p>Ranma  sighed to himself as his thought's drifted of Akane again.  If she hadn't stared at his naked body for so  long he'd swear she was some sort of lesbian.   Maybe she's just bi-sexual.  Yeah  that's it.  She's just mostly into  women.  That made sense.  In any case, if he ever wanted to go back to  his nomadic lifestyle he'd have to <b>honorably</b>  break the engagement.  But how?  This would take some time.</p><p>Later  that morning, Akane Tendo found herself practicing the routine she had for  several years now: Jogging.  All her  problems tend to wash away when she did this.   Those perverted boys at school, that fool Kuno, that...that freak Ranma  who had just entered her life.  This was  the one time of day where she could just forget about everything.  The only flaw was that she would have to  return to everything at some point.  As  she reached the street of the Tendo Dojo, her thoughts drifted to those of Dr.  Tofu.  Now there was a <b>real</b> man, not like those immature boys  at school, or any other boy she had met.</p><p>Those  thoughts were quickly interrupted by the sounds of a vicious battle.  In fact, the sound was coming from her  house.  Upon reaching her home, Akane  discovered the Tendo's houseguests fighting a seemingly epic battle in her own  backyard.  Though oddly she noticed Genma  was in his griffin form.</p><p>"C'mon  pop, is that all you got?" Ranma taunted.</p><p>Genma  shrieked in response as he moved his claws in for a fatal blow against his  son.  Despite the speed of the attack,  Ranma managed to escape it, however the front of his dogi was ripped to pieces  and his chest scratched by the razor sharp instruments of Genma-griffin.  Ranma winced back in pain.  He placed his hand on his new scar.  Not bothering with some lame statement of  revenge, the younger Saotome leapt straight at his father, his leg  outstretched.  Genma-griffin sighed at  his son's stupidity.  He easily jumped  over the attack and flew several feet in the air.  The young martial artiest  smiled as he suddenly vanished, at least in the eyes of the Tendos who by now  had all stopped to watch this scene.</p><p>Genma-griffin  didn't even realize his son suddenly reappearing right above him until it was  too late.  Ranma struck his fist a top  the griffin's head sending straight into the pond below.  Too bad he couldn't stop himself from falling  into the pond himself.</p><p>Ranma  climbed out of the pond, shaking her head in order to get the access water out  of her head.  She turned to the Tendos  who by that time were staring at her with disbelief.  The red headed girl simply grinned at them  and proudly said, "What a good workout!"</p><p>The  Tendos all face faulted.</p><p>"What  kind of family is that?" Akane asked her father.</p><p>"One  that shows a level of devotion to the art that we can only fathom," Soun  replied.</p><p>Akane  didn't like that answer.  She held  devotion to the art.  Very much so in fact,  but she couldn't move as fast or seeming hit as hard as</p><p>Ranma  could.  He must take some kind of  steroid.</p><p>Nabiki  merely scratched her head.  Her baby  sister's fiancé definitely was not a normal person.   She wondered how much money she could make  selling pictures of Ranma's girl form.   Kasumi was simply wondering what Griffin's liked to eat, should  Genma-griffin decided to eat breakfast the way he is now.</p><p>A  hot bath later...</p><p>"School?"  Ranma had just been told by his  father that he would be attending high school.</p><p>"Well,  we will be staying here for a while," Genma told him.</p><p>Ranma  really shouldn't have been surprised that he'd have to face school once  again.  He was really hoping to check out  the street fighting scene in downtown Tokyo, but that would have to  wait for now.  Nabiki passed him on her  way out the door, dressed a green school uniform.</p><p>"You'll  be going to the same school as Akane and me," she told him as she passed  by.  Ranma sighed inwardly as he began to  head back to his room to see if he could find an old school bag.  Before he could get anywhere he heard Nabiki  and Akane arguing over who should show him the way to school.  Did they both dislike him that much that they  didn't even want him around?  If that's  the case then why doesn't Akane just break the engagement?</p><p>"Hey  you two," Ranma called out to the two sisters.   "I'll make my own way to school."   The girls seemed satisfied with that idea, though they both doubted  Ranma would find Furinkan High before the bell rang.  Oh well, that was his problem not theirs.</p><p>Genma  was and Soun weren't as cooperative.</p><p>"What  are you talking about, boy!"  Genma  yelled.</p><p>"Oh  Akane, you break your father's heart by not helping your fiancé in his time of  need!" Soun cried.</p><p>"He's  not my fiancé!"  Akane Screamed.  "I hate boys!"</p><p>Ranma  nodded knowingly.  "Yeah, she's gotta be  a lesbian."</p><p>"What  was that!" Akane screamed.</p><p>"Well,  you said you hated guys?" Ranma tried to explain.  Judging by her reaction, there was a good  chance he may have been hasty in his classification of Akane's sexuality.</p><p>Not  given much time to react, the pony tailed martial artist found himself being beaten to a pulp by various heavy  objects.  Again.</p><p>"Oh  Akane, you shame your father."  Soun was  really crying now.</p><p>A  short time later Akane found herself heading to school followed by her pony  tailed fiancé who strangely seemed to prefer walking on the fence rather then  on the street with her.  This annoyed  Akane a bit as she assumed he thought he was too good to walk with her.  Stupid perverted ego maniac boy!</p><p>"We're  not getting married you know," Akane reminded the boy.</p><p>"Good,  keep thinking that," Ranma replied.</p><p>"What's  that supposed to mean?"</p><p>"I  don't wanna get married any more then you," Ranma  stated calmly.  "All I wanna do is find a cure for my, you know, condition, and then continue  on my top priority."</p><p>Akane  grunted at that.  "And what is you 'Top Priority'?"   Akane asked, a bit curious however she wanted to hid it by sounding  sarcastic.</p><p>"Revenge,"  Ranma stated coldly.</p><p>Akane  wasn't sure how to respond to that.  His  usual cocky tone was replaced with the much darker one she had only heard him  use once before.  When her father asked  him if his mother would be joining them Ranma responded negatively in the same  shameful voice as before.  Genma had  explained that she had died in China.  Perhaps there was more to that story then  what was said.</p><p>"Is  that the school?"  Ranma asked after an  acquired silence.</p><p>Akane  pushed all other thought aside when she realized they had reached their  destination.  "Yeah, that's Furinkan  High."</p><p>"Umm,  why is there an army of guys at the front gate?"</p><p>True  enough, a large mob of teenage boys awaited their oncoming target.  Surprisingly, Akane was more angry then  shocked at this display.</p><p>"Hate  boys, hate boys, hate boys, hate boys," Akane mumbled as she attacked the mob  head on.</p><p>"Akane,  I love you!"  Whack!</p><p>"Akane-san this for you!"  Whack!</p><p>"My  love for you will never die, Akane!"   Bam!</p><p>"This  is the winning goal of love!"  Pow!</p><p>"Go  out with me Akane!" Pow!</p><p>"Which  way is the soccer field?" Whack!</p><p>Ranma  in amazement watched as Akane beat the living tar out of any boy that even  looked like he may be apart of this mob.   No wonder she acted like a lesbian.   She obviously dealt with this sort of thing often since she wasn't  surprised by the mob.  He'd hate boys too  if they attacked him like that.</p><p>"Hey  Ranma," a familiar voice called out to him.   Nabiki Tendo so waved to him from her class window. "You'd better get to  class."</p><p>"What  about her?"  Ranma asked, pointing to  Akane.</p><p>"Don't  worry about it, this happens every morning," Nabiki explained.</p><p>Ranma simply nodded, but felt he should at  least stay until Akane was finished beating up her attackers.</p><p>Luckily  it would only take another few seconds.   Then Akane stood in the middle of the fallen horde of boys breathing a  bit heavily.</p><p>"You'd  think they'd take a hint..." Akane muttered.    No sooner did those word emerge from her mouth did she instinctively  plucked a speeding airborne rose that was zooming passed her.  That could only mean one thing.  She turned to her upperclassman and lamely  greeted "Good morning, Kuno."</p><p>Standing  in his usual kendo uniform, Tatewaki Kuno smirked a  cocky smirk as he sniffed a red rose while holding a bokken in his other  hand.  "Ah, what a truly boorish lot.  Each fool dreamed of impossible dreams of going out with you, on the eve of  your defeat that is.  Oh what fools these  mortals be that they believe they could achieve that which only one great as I  could possibly hope to gain."  He paused  for dramatic effect before clutching his weapon of choice with both hand and  facing the Tendo girl.  "Doubt thou the  stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move, doubt truth to be a liar, but  never doubt I love.  Will thou do me the  honor of fighting with me?"</p><p>Ranma  at this point was laughing a bit.  He  approached Akane with a rather large smirk on his face.</p><p>"Heh, so this is how you spend your mornings, eh?"  Ranma playfully asked.</p><p>Kuno  pointed his sword at the newcomer.  "And  who art thou who sees fit to talk to the fair Akane Tendo in such a familiar  tone?"</p><p>"Why,  you got a problem with who I talk to?"   Ranma asked, his smirk not fading.</p><p>"Stay  out of this," Akane warned.  "Or you're  gonna get hurt."</p><p>"I  doubt it," Ranma replied.</p><p>"Cur,  who are you to address my prowess in such a manner?" Kuno demanded.  He didn't let Ranma answer though.  "Wait, it is proper to give one's own name  first.  Fine then, mine I shall  give.  I am the undefeated kendo club  captain, and rising new star of the high school fencing world.  My name strikes fear into the hearts of  men.  But my peers call me the Blue  Thunder of Furikan High!"  Lighting  struck a nearby tree for emphasis.   "Tatewaki Kuno, age seventeen."</p><p>Ranma  simply shrugged.  "Yeah, well I'm staying  with Akane and her family..."  The older  boy cut him off.  "Staying with the  Tendos?  Under the  same roof...AS AKANE!"</p><p>With  a voice filled with rage, Kuno swung his bokken at full force at his nameless  opponent.  Ranma easily leapt over the  attack.</p><p>"I'm  the heir of the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Art, and judging from  that attack, I'm the guy who ends your undefeated record."  He tossed his bag to Akane before landing.  "I'm Ranma Saotome, age sixteen, and I accept  your challenge."</p><p>"Okay  people, take your bets," Nabiki spoke into a large megaphone as her lackeys  collected money from the surrounding students.   "Who do you think will come out with the victory:  The fierce self proclaimed 'Blue Thunder'  Tatewaki Kuno, or the mysterious dark horse, or should I say 'Wild Horse',  Ranma Saotome?"</p><p>Kuno  ignored his peers for the moment.  He  would need to concentrate on this <i>lesser </i>fighter  now.  He'd make this quick so he could  spend time with his beloved Akane.  He  swung his bokken toward Ranma yet again, same result as last time except Ranma  decided to retaliate with a swift and powerful kick while airborne.  Oops, looks like Kuno has a glass jaw.  One Kick and he's already out cold.</p><p>"NOOOOOOOOOO!"  Most of the male population  screamed.  "We bet everything on  Kuno!"</p><p>"Well,  well, well, looks like you boys owe me some money." Nabiki laughed.  It looks like this Ranma was as useful as she  hoped.</p><p>"Victory!"  Ranma acknowledge, though he  was a bit upset that the Great Kuno-Sempei put up no fight.</p><p>"Don't  get too cocky," Akane yelled, obviously jealous over her fiancé's skill.  "You're not that good!"</p><p>Ranma  didn't really notice Akane storm off angrily as most of the student body had  begun cheering wildly for him.  A normal  person would have figured they just really hated Kuno, but for an ego as large  as Ranma's...</p><p>"They  really love me," Ranma realized as he waved to his fans.  His face darkened though as a familiar figure  came to mind.  Though no one seemed to  notice a single tear rolled down the pony tailed martial artist's cheek as he  said a single word under his breath.</p><p>"Tenma..."</p><p>To  be continued…</p><p>Author's  Note:  Well, there it is.  The first chapter of my first fanfic.  I hope I did okay. Zanzouken is I move that  was barrowed from Dragon Ball.  Part of  Kuno's speech was borrowed from the play Hamlet.  I do not own either of these.  Ranma is out of character, but the reason  should be explained in upcoming chapters.   There are clues in this chapter as well.</p><p>Revision  Note:  Cleaned the chapter up a bit, and  added some more detail to certain parts.</p>
