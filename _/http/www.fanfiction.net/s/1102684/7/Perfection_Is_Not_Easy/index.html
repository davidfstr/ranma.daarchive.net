</div><p><i>Disclaimer: Ranma ½  was created by Rumiko Takahashi. I had nothing to do with it.  Please do not sue me for I don't write frequently enough to matter.</i></p><p>"Mom's  dead. I just found out a few days ago. She was murdered. Not in a  fight even; she was poisoned! I…don't know exactly who did it  but witnesses told me it was an amazon named "Lotion." What's  considered an amazon in China anyway? A woman warrior? A female  assassin? Right now all the information I have about them is that  they're a group of women strong in the martial arts. Whatever.  Mom deserved better than that. She deserved better than to be  poisoned by a coward!"</p><p>-Brief  passage form the journal of Ranma Saotome</p><p><b>The  Story Thus Far:</b> Ranma Saotome trained not  only with his father for the ten year training voyage but also his  mother Nodoka, a kendo master, and Ryoga Hibiki. As a result he  became much more adjusted, intelligent and skillful than he would  have he been alone with Genma. This "new" Ranma is smart, clever  and almost perfect in everything he does. However despite this, or  rather because of this, he has made some powerful enemies including  Emily Tisdale, a werewolf in love with Ryoga, and Pantyhose Taro, a  cursed martial artist with a grudge against him.</p><p>Now he is  engaged to Akane Tendo and has befriended her sisters Kasumi and  Nabiki. But it doesn't take long before his past catches up with  him. Amazons and bounty hunters are after him for reasons unclear  even to Ranma. And then there's this "Demon of Joketsuzoku"  business…</p><p><b>Last  Chapter:</b> Ranma related some of his past  experiences to Kasumi including that Tenma, the name he has suffered  over since he first came to the dojo, was actually some sort of  magical copy of him. Tenma died during a dispute with Ranma over how  they should go about avenging Nodoka's death. He blames himself  for it and has been brooding ever since.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Chapter  7</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Interruptions</b></p><p>A  week after his fight with Sin Ranma decided it was time for him to  return to his normal routine. The Tendo house had become an all too  familiar sight lately. The pony tailed youth needed to spend his days  away from this place; interact with someone other than Kasumi and  Soun. Not to say the eldest Tendo sister wasn't good company.  After Ranma spilled his guts a few days earlier the older girl had  been amazingly supportive; so much that the young man felt like she  was one of his best friends.</p><p>However  despite his newfound friendship there was no reason for Ranma to  remain at the Tendo Dojo to recover. Dr. Tofu had visited and  explained that Ranma was mostly fine, but should try not to get into  any major fights for about a week. Therefore the pony tailed fighter  planned to return to school today and finally start his part time job  with the good doctor. The morning paved the way back to normality  when Ranma easily defeated his father in a sparring match (though it  had to be limited so the boy wouldn't strain himself). Once the  fight was over the joined clans of Tendo and Saotome sat down  together for breakfast.</p><p>Something  that hadn't returned to normal was Nabiki's lack of contact to  the boy. At first Ranma thought it may have just been her feeling  awkward after the events she went through. However her continuing  decision to not talk to him made the Saotome Heir wonder if it was  something else. Perhaps Nabiki had decided that Ranma was too  dangerous to be around and that staying as far from him as possible  was the best way to keep her from being caught up in his problems.  That was the most logical reasoning, but was that it? He wasn't  sure.</p><p>To  further his curiosity on the subject Nabiki left the table as soon as  she was done with her meal; she said she had important business at  school. The middle Tendo was a master at hiding her emotions but  Ranma was becoming much better at reading her masks every time he  looked at her. He decided that he'd talk to her later in the day.</p><p>It  wasn't long until Ranma found himself walking along his fiancée  toward Furinkan High. Unlike her sister Akane wasn't avoiding the  boy at all. In fact ever since he started showing signs of getting  better the youngest Tendo had bombarded him with questions regarding  his past. This morning was no different.</p><p>"Why  won't you tell me more about it?' Akane would demand.</p><p>And  Ranma would reply "I told you enough already. Get over it."</p><p>Akane  wasn't amused by Ranma's attitude. "I know you told Kasumi  something about your past, but she won't tell me anything."</p><p>"Uh  huh," was the reply.</p><p>This  didn't help ease the girl's anger. "Don't 'uh huh' me,  Ranma! Three people come to town to kill you, one says there's a  bounty on you and the other two were monsters. I want to know why  there are people after you!"</p><p>The  pony tailed youth rolled his eyes. "You already know why."  Ranma hated to repeat himself, especially when they had to do with  his past. Luckily (sort of) he didn't have to since Soun had  blabbed the entire story of Emily and Taro. Thankfully the story  about Tenma was of course still a secret between Ranma, Kasumi and  the still absent Ryoga.</p><p>"But,"  Akane continued. "You still haven't explained why there's a  bounty on your head!"</p><p>Unlike  his fiancée Ranma was actually pretty calm. In fact during  this whole conversation he barely even looked at Akane. "I told  you I don't know why I have a bounty. I'm really getting sick of  having this conversation again and again."</p><p>Akane  fumed at this. Losing her temper she rose to strike the boy for  being such a jerk. To her surprise Ranma effortlessly blocked the  attack with his forearm. He looked at her with sad eyes that  instantly made her regret her action. Slowly she backed off.</p><p>"I  told you everything I can right now," was the boy's reply to the  attack. He resumed the walk to school. "Let's not kill each  over this, okay?"</p><p>The  youngest Tendo simply stood there as Ranma continued on to school.  He did not usually act his way with her. At the most he'd insult  her but that would be it. This reaction was a first. It was then  she had realized her mistake: she had known Ranma had some issues  with his past but she had gotten used to him to the point here had  forgotten that aspect. She silently promised to be more  understanding of him from now on. He was a jerk, but she still  considered him somewhat of a friend. A little.</p><p>"I  haven't written in a while. Something really weird has been going  on the last couple weeks. It started when Ryoga used this magic item  thing on me. Next thing I know there's a guy with my face starring  at me. His eyes were different but besides that he was...me. His  name is Tenma and he's got all my memories. He's actually a  pretty nice guy, except he's…cold, I guess. Really cold. He's  been traveling with us since then. It's really interesting to spar  with someone who literally knows all your moves. I wonder what Pop  will say when he meets him."</p><p>-Brief  passage from the Journal of Ranma Saotome.</p><p>Lunch  time came around. That's when things started becoming annoying for  Ranma. After waking up from his History Lecture he immediately went  off in search of Nabiki. He still felt he needed to talk to her  about what had happened. However as soon as he walked out of the  building he became distracted by a large group of females. All of  them had odd, lustful looks and each carried a bento.</p><p>"Hi  Ranma," they all said at once. It was creepy to say the least.</p><p>"Um,  hi," was the reply.</p><p>"I  made an extra lunch. Do you want it?" One said</p><p>"Hey,  I made lunch for him!" Said another.</p><p>"No  way, he's eating mine!" Yet another suggested.</p><p>At  this point it became clear that every girl here had made Ranma lunch.   Despite the fact that his baser instincts told him that he should  take all their food and happily consume them he managed to resist it.   Instead he asked "Uh, I'm gonna have to pass. I'm looking for  someone."</p><p>All  of the girls looked disappointed. One of them stood forward. "We  are the newly formed Ranma Saotome Fan Club. We've been waiting  for you to come back to school."</p><p>The  young fighter raised his eyebrow at this. "Ranma Saotome Fan  Club?"</p><p>"Yes,"  she continued. "We've all watched you since you first came  here."</p><p>"It  was so cool the way you beat Kuno all those times!"</p><p>"Just  seeing you move…it's so…so…"</p><p>"Beautiful!"</p><p>"Yeah,  that's it!"</p><p>"You're  so calm and mysterious!"</p><p>"And  exotic!"</p><p>At  his point Ranma countered by putting his hands in a "T-shaped"  position. "Time out ladies. You aren't serious about this, are  you?"</p><p>They  all nodded.</p><p>"You  all heard I'm engaged to Akane by now, right?"</p><p>They  all nodded.</p><p>"We've  heard you two don't get along," one said</p><p>"She  even admitted that you two are being forced by your parents," said  another</p><p>Ranma  pinched the bridge of his nose. He was flattered to be sure, but  this was just as bad as all the boys attacking Akane every morning.  Plus with of them looking at him like with those big eager eyes it  was just plain spooky . He didn't have a lot of time to waste with  these girls. He needed a distraction….</p><p>Pointing  off into the distance Ranma yelled in shock "Hey, isn't that a  mysterious and angst ridden pretty boy who just transferred to the  school?"</p><p>The  crowd of girls quickly turned toward where Ranma had pointed all of  them unable to contain their interest. However once they realized it  was a lie the Saotome Heir had vanished.</p><p>Things  didn't get better that day. Ranma ended up dodging this new  threat, this so-called "Ranma Saotome Fan Club" during any type  of break the pony tailed youth got during the day. Of course Ranma  was flattered; in fact he understood their feelings. After all he  was the one and only Ranma Saotome. However they kept getting in the  way in what would be the relatively simple task of finding and  talking to Nabiki. Eventually school ended, but even so in a  combined effort of the middle Tendo sister rushing off campus  (Probably to avoid him) and this fan club getting one last mob rush  in (Which made Akane avoid him as well) the young martial artist  found the day to be a total waste.</p><p>He  should have headed back to the Tendo Training Hall; he and Nabiki  needed to clear the air sooner than later. He still didn't know  what was wrong, or at least wasn't exactly sure. Sadly he  absolutely needed to start his part time job with Dr. Tofu, as his  injuries had made him unable to start sooner. Nabiki would have to  wait.</p><p>And  so now here Ranma was, sweeping the front entrance of the clinic. It  seemed that by "assistant" Dr. Tofu meant janitor. It wasn't  exactly thrilling but he had already made the agreement and couldn't  back out of it no. Sighing he looked at his handy work. "Seems  clean enough," he mused to himself as he headed back inside. There  weren't any patients right now as the waiting room was empty.  Making his way into the back he found his glasses wearing employer  seated and reading a newspaper.</p><p>"Oh,  done already I see," the friendly doctor said smiling at the young  man. "You are a very hard worker."</p><p>Ranma  just shrugged. "It ain't like it's complicated work or  nothing."</p><p>Tofu  continued to smile. "I suppose. Sorry if it's a little boring.  I promise it'll get more interesting eventually." With that the  doctor yawned. "Boy, I'm tired. I bet we could both use a  break."</p><p>Ranma  raised an eyebrow, as Tofu hadn't actually done any work since he  arrived two hours ago.</p><p>The  brown haired martial artist excused himself into his bedroom,  returning a minute later with a little money. "Why don't you get  us some snacks? This should be enough to cover both of us."</p><p>The  pony tailed youth shrugged, accepting the money. As he left the  clinic he stopped by a garden hose and proceeded to splash himself  instantly turning him into a girl. Ranma wasn't sure if the doc  would condone her using her female form to get free food but what he  didn't know wouldn't hurt him. He'd just have t remember to  return the money before he went home.</p><p>Back  in the clinic Dr. Tofu was in deep thought. Ranma had come along  very nicely. The boy was strong to be sure. He had been afraid his  injuries may affect his plans, but luckily the Heir to the Saotome  School proved to be an amazingly fast healer. Yes, Ranma would do.  They had made a good choice when they picked him.</p><p>Everything  was going according to plan, and the good doctor couldn't help but  smile at that.</p><p>"Hey,  don't you think that's enough," Ranma sneered at her new  opponent, clutching the black haired girl's ribbon with disdain.  Things had not gone according to plan for the now red-headed pony  tailed girl. She had managed to score a great deal of free food,  ensuring that she and Tofu wouldn't have to buy any snacks for at  least a week. However on her way back to the clinic she found  this…girl being attacked by four men, seemingly hiding their  identities in bandages. Ranma would have intervened on the girl's  behalf if she hadn't brutally beaten her aggressors. The cursed  martial artist ended up having to save the attackers from the victim!</p><p>The  black haired girl had an intrigued look. She wore a school uniform  Ranma didn't recognize, but realistically didn't care wither way.   "You...stopped my ribbon. Interesting. You are no ordinary  girl."</p><p>Ranma  smiled her cocky grin. "Yeah, I get that a lot."</p><p>The  mysterious black haired girl snapped her ribbon from out of Ranma's  hand, an action that surprised the Chinese clothes clad girl. This  chick wasn't bad. "I am Kodachi the Black Rose. I'm sure  we'll meet again. OHOHOHOHO!" With that Ranma found herself  blinded by a barrage of black rose pedals. When the pedals subsided  Kodachi was gone.</p><p>Ranma  couldn't help but be impressed. That exit was kinda cool. In fact  that girl would be cute if she didn't have that horrible laugh.  Plus she reminded her of someone…</p><p>"Thanks  for saving us," a sobbing while at the same time high pitched voice  called out. Ranma turned to see the guys she rescued crying.</p><p>"Um,  don't worry about it," was her response. "But you guys really  shouldn't mess with someone stronger than you."</p><p>Seemingly  upset at being called guys, the bandaged attackers tore off their  coverings revealing to in fact be girls. Girls in Ranma's class  actually.</p><p>Nerima  was weird.</p><p>"Tenma's  a great guy. I mean, yeah, he's supposed to be me, but he's not.   It's weird. But anyway, yeah he's awesome. Yesterday we were  in a village and we saw these two big guys messing with a restaurant  owner. Tenma beat the shit out both of them for 'picking on the  weak.' They guy has got one serious sense of duty. Ryoga's been  saying he's like an evil clone of me or something. He ain't  evil. Just cold. Very, very…very cold."</p><p>- Brief  passage form the journal of Ranma Saotome</p><p>Soap was  not, nor had she ever been, nor would she probably ever become, a  patient person. Her teacher, Towel, had always tried to steer the  young warrior toward that path but something like patience takes  years to master if you lack it. Sadly Towel had died before she  could give the young blonde any more lessons. In fact both her  parents, older brother, friends and pretty much everyone close to her  were completely slaughtered very recently. Any sane person would  have been using this time to mourn. However Soap was amazon, which  meant two things: 1) She was a warrior by trade and had no time to  think about the dead while her enemies still breathed and 2) Probably  wasn't too stable in the mental department.</p><p>In  all seriousness even her battle hardened teacher often said Soap  probably was not playing with a full deck, even by amazon standards.</p><p>Currently,  inside the apartment her band of "sisters" were able to secure  while in Nerima, the blonde Chinese girl (An interesting mix) was  playing with a knife. She did this daily; daydreaming about the  various things she could do to Ranma Saotome. She could gut him,  maybe even slit his throat. Perhaps she could just blind him.  That'd be poetic justice: the Demon of Joketsuzoku forced to live  in this world as a helpless cripple…</p><p>Of  course as soon as she thought the words "Demon of Joketsuzoku"  she deadpanned. Ranma wiped everyone out at their village. He was  no man but a demon is disguise. She wasn't a match for him and  would probably never be able to make those daydreams come true. How  depressing.</p><p>At  that moment the pink haired, and highly attractive, Comb (leader of  their party) entered the room. She was, like Soap, seventeen.  Despite her young age she was put in charge of this mission for two  very important reasons: 1) She was the most qualified in term of  skill and rank to do so and 2) Alive, which was more than you could  say for the majority of the rest of the Chinese amazon community. Of  course Cologne would have preferred someone with more experience in  charge but beggars can't be choosers. The older Lotion would have  made a good choice if she hadn't...well, that's another story.</p><p>Comb  scanned the room. No sign of their companion whatsoever. Not good.  " Where's Lotion? " She asked her subordinate in  mandarin.</p><p>" Don't  know. Don't really care either. " Was the matter-of-fact  reply. Soap hadn't even bothered to take her eyes off her knife.</p><p>Comb  swore. Lotion wasn't here. But where the hell did she go? They  were supposed to be keeping a low profile after all!</p><p>" Any  word from Elder Cologne? Soap asked, again not looking up.</p><p>The  pink haired amazon sighed. Soap clearly was itching to attack  Saotome. " No, none. I thought she would have sent a reply by  now. "</p><p>Soap  nodded but said nothing. She simply continued to ignore the world  around her. Comb was somewhat thankful. Her companion wasn't the  best company. Still she had to wonder…</p><p>Where  the hell did Lotion go?</p><p>Ranma's  walk home from work was uneventful. He was thankful for that,  considering all that happened that day. It would seem that no matter  what he did there'd always be something causing him grief. As the  young martial artist approached the Tendo dojo he wondered if things  could get any more stressful today.</p><p>Of  course as soon as he said that he heard a noise form a nearby  rooftop. Turning quickly and scanning the area Ranma found….nothing.   He was sure he had heard something but….maybe he was just tired.  With that he continued on home.</p><p>From the  said rooftop Lotion cursed herself for not being for stealthy. She'd  had to be more careful.</p><p>Walking  through the front door of the Tendo house Ranma immediately was  surprised to see who was sitting facing the doorway.</p><p>"Ryoga!"</p><p>The  bandana clad youth was indeed there, his clothes torn and dirty. His  facial expression suggested exhaustion. "I suffered to get back  here, you know."</p><p>Ranma  shrugged, not appearing to have any sympathy. "But you got back  here, so what's the problem?"</p><p>The  fanged boy stood up angrily at that, grabbing Ranma by the collar.  "And whose fight was it that got me lost in the first place?"</p><p>"A  minor detail," was the somewhat cocky response of the pony tailed  boy.</p><p>Ryoga  sneered at that. "That's it! I'll beat an apology out of you  for my troubles!"</p><p>Now  Dr. Tofu had advised that Ranma not get into any big fights so soon  after his recent ordeal but on the other hand he owed Ryoga for that  loss a while back…</p><p>"As  if you could actually lay a finger on me."</p><p>Needless  to say within two minutes the two training partners were scrambling  toward the dojo. Upon reaching the door they both got caught trying  to squeeze through the door at once, both yelling at the other to  move. Finally breaking through the door they were suddenly stopped  dead in their tracks by what they saw: Akane, who appeared to have  accidentally tied herself up with a ribbon while practicing.</p><p>Red  in the face at being caught Akane simply said "A little help."</p><p>With  that both young men burst into laughter.</p><p>A  little while later, after Akane pounded on her two houseguests for  being jerks, it was explained that the youngest Tendo had agreed to  sub for the school's martial arts rhythm gymnastics team which  seemed like an odd thing for the girl to agree to.</p><p>"Well,"  Ryoga began. "You're clumsy."</p><p>"What?"  was Akane's reply.</p><p>"What?   You want me to lie?" Ryoga continued, now raising an eyebrow.  "I'm not exactly sure what made you think that you were graceful  enough to do to this but you're not. Oh God you're not."</p><p>The  youngest Tendo began fuming. She couldn't really understand why  Ryoga was being such a jerk. She would have almost certainly bashed  his head in with a timely mallet, were it not for her catching  Raman's eyes. There was something about them that were…soothing;  he was in fact looking directly into her own. She found herself  feeling like he should take a breath and cool down. But mostly she  felt like Ranma had something to say. So she let him talk.</p><p>"Akane,"  he started. "Do you need any help?"</p><p>Both  Ryoga and Akane froze in shock. It was Akane who asked first. "What  do you know about gymnastics?"</p><p>"Martial  Arts Rhythm Gymnastics," he corrected. The two continued looking  on with blank expressions. "What? You don't believe me."</p><p>Their  continued silence prompted the young martial artist to pick up a  ribbon. With a grace neither other teen thought very probable Ranma  demonstrates an incredible skill with the unlikely weapon. In fact  at some point it seemed he spelled out the phrase "Fair Play."</p><p>"That's  not bad," Ryoga huffed.</p><p>Akane  was dumbstruck. She never realized that Ranma was this talented.  "Where did you learn that?"</p><p>"Mom  made me learn all sorts of weird styles," Ranma explained as he  folded the ribbon back into its proper place. "You should try  Martial Arts Tea Ceremony. Very relaxing."</p><p>Akane  smiled. "This is great! Then you'll help me?"</p><p>The  Saotome Heir smiled. "Hell, I'll even teach you some tricks to  give you an extra advantage."</p><p>"Tenma  and Ryoga don't get along. Ever since Tenma came around Ryoga  didn't trust him. Lately it's been worse. I had to break them  up twice before they turned simple sparring into an all out brawl. I  really hope they can just...calm down."</p><p>- Brief  passage form the journal of Ranma Saotome</p><p>Akane was  too tired to go on that night after a few hours of Ranma pounding the  lessons of Martial Arts Gymnastics into her. Ranma for his part was  a little worried about Akane's overall lack of speed and grace. In  fact he wasn't certain that Akane had a prayer against a trained  expert in the sport. But this was part of the plan.</p><p>He  was in his room, doing some thinking. Everything that happened in the  time he's been in Nerima, the time he spent in China, the training  voyage in general; all of it has been a train wreck. Things had  gotten so bad and the future didn't look very promising. He needed  to leave soon and to do that he needed to implement his plan on  teaching Akane the Saotome Style of their school; it had been  Nabiki's great idea after all to unite the schools under rather  than going through with the arranged marriage. This was a great  opportunity to get started on training her without looking  suspicious. If the old men realized what he was trying to do they'd  try some scheme to stop him for sure. Whether the youngest Tendo  learns enough of Martial Arts Gymnastics to really give her opponent  a workout was irrelevant; the true plan was to make her his student.</p><p>Ranma's  musings were interrupted by the sound of a someone walking around the  hallway outside his door. Judging by the weight on the hardwood  floor (Which he could tell by hearing the subtle cracks in the floor)  he determined it was a girl who was too short to be Kasumi and too  lightweight to be Akane. The pony tailed boy quickly rose to his  feet and exited his room to find Nabiki coming from the rest room.  The two teenager's eyes met and created an intense awkwardness  between the two. It was the middle Tendo daughter who spoke first.</p><p>"You  need something Saotome?" she asked.</p><p>Ranma  shook his head. "Not especially. I've started training Akane  today."</p><p>The  so-called Ice Queen made no outward response. It bothered Ranma that  even he was having a hard time reading her. "Well good for you. I  suppose that means you'll be leaving sooner than later."</p><p>"Looks  that way," Ranma replied. "Akane's kind of a slow learner so  it may be a while but me and the old man shouldn't be bothering ya  too much longer." He paused a bit before continuing. "So…you've  been avoiding me." It wasn't a question.</p><p>Nabiki  laughed at that notion. "Don't flatter yourself, Ranma. I'm a  busy girl, you know. I don't have time to entertain dumb jocks  everyday of the week."</p><p>The  teenaged martial artist nodded at that. "I guess so. Not that I'd  blame you for avoiding me seeing as I'm so dangerous and all."  Actually Ranma suspected that Nabiki's sudden mood change had  little to do with that. It seems all the Tendo girls had a sort of  interesting way of coping with the unusual (Something he noticed  earlier) so near death experiences would probably not be something to  make any of them hate you. But he hoped that saying that may strike  a nerve.</p><p>Nabiki  was taken aback by that comment. She normally wouldn't have been  but she had, as of late, been more flustered than calm and collective  around Ranma. "It's not that…it's just that…" She  gathered up as much courage as she could for this. This was all sort  of new to her; she wasn't accustomed to telling people her true  feelings let alone telling boys that she has an intense crush on them  and is jealous because they might like her older sister instead. But  Nabiki Tendo was not one to turn away from a challenge. "Look  Ranma, I saw you and Kasumi the other night."</p><p>Ranma's  first reaction was nervousness. Did she hear the story about Tenma?  Was she upset? Disgusted? Sympathetic? He had to know; it was his  most guarded secret after all. "What…What did you hear?"</p><p>"I  heard-" Nabiki was cut off by the sounds of Akane screaming from  her room. Before she even had a chance to react Ranma was gone;  darting towards his fiancée's room.</p><p>Not  bothering to knock the pony tailed martial artists kicked Akane's  door open and rushed in only to find the girl being assaulted by a  familiar face who was armed with a mallet and apparently bent on  injuring the youngest Tendo. "Aw hell, not you again!"</p><p>Kodachi  the Black Rose eyes narrowed at the sight on the handsome stranger  who now stood before her. "An interruption. How dull. And who  might you be? I'm certain we've never met before."</p><p>Ranma  frowned at his inability to think before he talked. "Well…what I  mean is that I've heard of you, Flower Girl, and you're just as  crazy as my pal with the red hair said you were."</p><p>The Black  Rose smiled evilly at that. "Red hair? The girl in the pony tail  from this afternoon perhaps? Interesting. But you have still not  given me your name?"</p><p>The pony  tailed boy was now certain that this crazy chick reminded him of  someone…someone extremely annoying. There was a resemblance to  Emily Tisdale, or course, but that wasn't who he was thinking of.  "I don't give my name to criminals who break into other people  houses in the middle of the night.</p><p>Akane  looked over towards her fiancé. "I think this is the girl  I'm supposed to fight at the competition, Ranma. Look at the way  she's dressed"</p><p>Kodachi's  smile had not yet faded. "Ranma? I see, you do have the look of a  Wild Horse about you. I resent your tone though, peasant. I merely  came here to ensure that both myself and my opponent fight as equals  in all fairness."</p><p>"How?  By breaking her knees while she's sleeping?" Ranma demanded.</p><p>"If  need be…yes!" With that Kodachi launched the mallet towards the  pony tailed martial artist at a speed that he was barely able to  dodge it. The impact against the wall was dangerously large…this  girl was good! The gymnasts immediately blinded her new found  enemies with black rose pedals and made her escape out of the window.   Her voice echoed through the darkness. "We shall meet again Akane  Tendo…and you as well Ranma. OHOHOHOHO!"</p><p>"Damn  it!" Ranma cursed. He grabbed the discarded mallet and attempted  to chase down the crazed girl leaving Akane to wonder who was going  to clean this mess. The pony tailed martial artist followed his prey  to the roof of the Tendo home only to realize that the girl was far  enough away from him that he wasn't certain he could catch her.  Instead he threw the mallet directly toward her, hitting the girl in  the back of the head. Knocked silly the Black Rose found herself  falling from the roof. "Oh crap," Ranma noted as she seemed to  be falling to her doom…or at least a minor injury. He would have  gone after her except the he was distracted by all his senses warning  him of danger.</p><p>Sure  enough Ranma just barely managed to duck a dagger being thrown at him  from another rooftop. Looking straight at head he saw a Chinese girl  dressed in distinctly Amazon clothing looking at him, roughly three  houses over.</p><p>" Damn, "  Lotion muttered to herself in Chinese. " Missed the mark. "</p><p>Forgetting  all about Kodachi Ranma made his way closer to the new arrival. "Who  the hell are you?"</p><p>Lotion  looked towards the pony tailed boy before producing a very long and  dangerous looking sword. "I am Lotion of Joketsuzoku. And this,  demon, will go one of two ways: your death...or mine."</p><p>A Ranma's  face paled when she mentioned her name. "You...you're that rogue  amaozn, aren't you!"</p><p>Lotion  responded with an icy glare. "After you slaughtered the village I  was reinstated. They needed every able body."</p><p>It was  indeed the one he'd heard about! After all this time! It was all  Ranma could do to keep himself from lashing out at her, but the cold  truth was this <i>woman </i>knew  more about what happened at Joketsuzoku than he did. "So they  re-hired you, huh? Good for you, but if you ask me their taste in  warriors is lacking. What'd they need you for? To kill me?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And  you're the same guys who put the bounty on me, right?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Wonderful.   And it's because you think I killed everyone in the village? That  I'm the Demon of Joketsuzoku or whatever?"</p><p>Lotion  hesitated before answering that question. "It does stand to reason  that you may not in fact be the one we seek. Therefore we needed to  test you; test your power. So far we haven't been impressed. So I  shall be the final test. Among all those you have faced thus far you  will not hold back your abilities on me."</p><p>The  Saotome Heir narrowed his eyes. "And why's that?"</p><p>"Because  I killed your mother."</p><p>The pony  tailed youth frowned at that. "Yeah…ain't that the truth!"</p><p>And with  that he pouched on his enemy.</p><p>"Tenma  died. It was four weeks ago. I couldn't bring myself to write it  down at first. He and I got into a fight about avenging mom and he  ended up falling off a cliff and I couldn't' pull him up. Maybe  I didn't want to. First Mom, now Tenma. He was person, he was my  brother. Now he's gone."</p><p>-Brief  passage from the journal of Ranma Saotome</p><p>Ryoga had  been oblivious to all of the going on of the Tendo Dojo. Instead he  had been lost in the backyard of the house unable to find a door…for  hours now! Oh the embarrassment of his curse; to never know where  you are or where you're going!</p><p>On  the bright side at least he didn't turn into a girl.</p><p>But even  so this was just crazy. Having only just returned to the Dojo he was  hesitant in leaving again as it could take him weeks to get back. As  silly as it was he'd have to make camp here. Hopefully he'd wake  up before Ranma to he could spare his old friend the opportunity to  make fun of him.</p><p>The  bandana clad youngster would have started unpack had he not heard the  sounds of a girl screaming in pain. Looking up he saw a leotard  wearing girl falling from the roof of the house. Instinctively the  lost boy dropped his traveling gear a leapt up to catch her. Doing  so with ease the young man returned them both safely to the roof.</p><p>"Hey,  are you alright?" H asked.</p><p>The girl,  coming to her senses after the blow to her head, smiled at the kind  and handsome stranger. "Yes…now. Thanks to you. What is your  name, kind sir?"</p><p>Ryoga  looked at her puzzled. He wasn't really sure why she was looking  at him like that. "Ryoga. Ryoga Hibiki of the School of Anything  Goes Martial Arts."</p><p>That was  all Kodachi needed. Pulling flowers out of nowhere represented them  to her savior…which of course shot out a paralyzing powered.  Frozen the young fighter was now helpless.</p><p>"Sweet  Ryoga, please be gentle with me for it is my first time."</p><p>"AAAHAHHH!"  Is what Ryoga tired to say, but the effects of the powered made it  far less clear. Luckily for the boy Kodachi was blindsided by an  angry Akane who chose this moment to arrive on the roof. Quickly  doing a somewhat slow kick form the Tendo girl the gymnast was forced  to back away from her newly discovered beloved.</p><p>"Tut  tut, it would seem I am interrupted yet again," Kodachi spat.</p><p>"Oh  don't mind me, I don't care what you and Ryoga do up here...above  my room…with no shame," was Akane's response.</p><p>The  gymnast smirked wickedly. "You're words speak differently from  your actions. No matter. Dear Ryoga, we shall meet again!  OHOHOHOHO!"</p><p>With  Kodachi gone Ryoga though he was safe, but Akane stomping on his face  made him realize he was wrong.</p><p>"Have  you no shame!" She demanded. "Right over my own roof!"</p><p>"Wasn't…my…fault,"  Ryoga tried to say, though he was still positioned.</p><p>Neither  of them noticed Nabiki sneaking out of the grounds towards where  Ranma was fighting.</p><p>Lotion  found herself again being knocked backwards. Ranma had proved to be  more than a match for her afterall. However she could tell that the  boy was exerting himself in order rot avoid her blows. Why? If he  was powerful enough to defeat the entire amaozn nation surely she  should be dead already.</p><p>Ranma  looked over at his foe. He wasn't exactly sure what he was trying  to do here. He clearly had the upper hand, and despite what Lotion  claimed he had in fact been holding back. His personal code of honor  prevented him from killing a weaker opponent, afterall. But then  again that same code dictated that he defeat this girl "You give up  yet, ya murdering bitch?"</p><p>Lotion  stood her ground. "It is somewhat amusing to hear a demon say such  a thing."</p><p>"I  ain't a demon. I've never been to your village. Hell, your  buddy Shampoo was a friend mine," Ranma responded.</p><p>Lotion  nodded. "Indeed, I'm starting to agree with you. But I can't  give up-" Her thoughts remained unfinished as a bright light  blinded both martial artists. When Ranma's vision returned the  girl was gone.</p><p>"Damn,"  he cursed. He had been cheated out of avenging his mother as well as  learning more about what happened at Joketsuzoku. One thing was  starting to become clear. A demon came to that village, slaughtered  most everyone there, and happened to look just like him.</p><p>Tenma.   It had to be. He wanted all the amazons to pay for their mother's  death, afterall. If he managed to survive the fall then he had  somehow gained the power to do just that. If that was the case than  that may mean that somewhere in China, or rather somewhere in the  world, was a super powered killer with his face. This of course was  all speculation as he had no real proof, but it made the most sense.</p><p>By  now a familiar voice calling out from below interrupted his "Ranma!"   It was Nabiki and from where Ranma was standing she didn't look  like a girl who spent a great deal of time masking her emotions. She  was worried, even Ryoga would have been able to tell that.</p><p>"Yo,"  Ranma called back down. He leapt from the roof he was standing and  landed gracefully in front of her. It was rather impressive.  "What's up?"</p><p>Nabiki  was confused and a little angry at her sister's fiancé.  "What was going on? I saw you fighting someone over here? Are you  crazy? You only just healed up from your last fight!"</p><p>Ranma  was pleasantly surprised by Nabiki's reaction. It would seem that  she wasn't nearly as indifferent towards him as she wanted him to  believe. Even so he couldn't just tell her the truth; that his  "evil" clone killed an entire village of people in retaliation  for one of those people, the woman he was fighting, poisoning his  mother which also led directly to a bounty on his head.</p><p>"Looks  like that crazy Kodachi chick that Akane's suppose to fight next  week wanted some extra insurance or something," Ranma lied. "Guess  she brought in some backup."</p><p>Ranma had  more lies to tell, in case Nabiki was too smart for that one, but he  didn't get the opportunity. The middle Tendo girl pulled the boy  close and kissed him good and long. Even the Saotome Heir, well  adjusted as he was, was taken aback by this. When she broke off the  kiss the perhaps inappropriately named "Ice Queen" looked just as  shocked by her actions as Ranma.</p><p>"I…I  don't know why I did that," she admitted. "I guess I' was  just glad you weren't hurt."</p><p>Ranma  nodded. "Well…we probably shouldn't' do that again. Seeing  as I'm engaged to your sister. Family honor and all that."</p><p>"Oh  yeah, totally," Nabiki said, vigorously nodded in agreement.  "Family honor is really important."</p><p>There was  a pause. The two teenagers kissed again, with more passion on both  sides than before. Despite this there was trouble in the back of  Ranma's mind: Tenma, the amazons, his mother….these issues needed  to be addressed and soon.</p><p>For the  moment Ranma would try to forget these trouble.</p><p>From a  distance not too far away Lotion angrily looked on at her savior. "I  do not appreciate being interrupted, Cologne!"</p><p>The aged  matriarch looked over the young subordinate with disdain. "Child  it was your lack of respect that resulted in your expulsion to begin  with. And yet you continue to do so with that mouth of yours. From  where I stood were in danger."</p><p>"I  apologize elder," Lotion said. "But regardless I believe that  Ranma Saotome isn't the one we're looking for."</p><p>The short  wrinkled old woman sighed. "It is true that I sensed no demonic  chi from the boy, and the fact that he didn't brutally murder you  outright does speak volumes to his character. However we must  remember that your fight was within close proximity to that family  he's been living with."</p><p>Lotion  nodded. "Yes, I understand. If he's infiltrated them than he  may have been trying to protect his cover should they see anything.  You're right of course."</p><p>Cologne  frowned even more so at her charge. "You were foolish to face him  alone, even if you were just testing him. We will not make that  mistake again. Take me to the others; we shall give this boy one  final challenge to prove his identity once and for all. Even if he's  not the demon we sought he may have other uses…"</p><p>To be  continued…</p><p>Next Time:   Ranma versus the amazons; Akane versus Kodachi. Plus Kuno returns!</p><p><b>Authors  Note:</b><br/>Sure it  only took, what, four years? But hey better late than never, right?  This chapter was going to be much shorter but at the last second I  decided to add a few more pages. Oh well. I hope you enjoyed it  because I'm not sure when the next chapter will come out. The  problem with writing a new chapter to a story that you haven't  worked on in a long time is that you tend to forget where you were  going with it. As a result some of the aspects of this chapter may  seem a bit out of left field, but I think it'll work out  eventually. Just like with "Ranma and the Monkey King" I plan to  do a massive re-write to the previous chapters when I get the chance.   I suspect this story needs it more anyway.</p>
