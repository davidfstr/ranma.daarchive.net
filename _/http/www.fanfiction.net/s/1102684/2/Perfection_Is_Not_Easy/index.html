</div><p>Disclaimer:  Ranma ½  was created by Rumiko Takahashi.  I had  nothing to do with it.  Please do not sue  me; I have little or no money.</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p><b>Integration</b></p><p>"Class, we have a new student with us," the teacher  of Ranma's new home room teacher announced.   "Ranma Saotome.  He's just  returned to Japan from a trip to China so let's give him a nihao  welcome."<br/>"Wow, he's gorgeous!"</p><p>"That's  the guy who kicked Kuno's ass!"</p><p>"Is  he single?"</p><p>"He  does them martial art, right?"</p><p>Ranma  rubbed his head in embarrassment.</p><p>The  teacher sighed as she motioned to his class to settle down.</p><p>"Ahem,  anyway Ranma, why don't you tell us about yourself?" The teacher requested.</p><p>"There  isn't a lot to tell, really," Ranma admitted.   "I'm a martial artiest who just got back from training trip to China."</p><p>"What  was China like?"</p><p>"What  style of martial art do you practice?</p><p>"Do  you have a girlfriend?"</p><p>Ranma  simply laughed.  "China was...you know, China.  I use the Anything Goes style.  And I don't have a girlfriend."  The last statement caused the most of the  female population give a silent cheer.</p><p>"Alright,  that's enough introduction time," the teacher warned.  "Just because you're new doesn't excuse the  fact that you and Akane Tendo were late for class.  Go stand in the hall."</p><p>Five  minutes later, the two teens found themselves standing in the hallway holding  buckets full of water.  Akane was very  upset at the whole situation.  She became  even angrier when she noticed that Ranma was actually whistling to himself and  didn't seem to mind that he was being punished or that he had gotten her in  trouble.  Maybe he was too stupid to  realize what he'd done.  She decided to  enlighten him.</p><p>"This  is all you fault, you know," Akane explained after a long while a silence.</p><p>"It  was your fight," Ranma reminded her.</p><p>"Yes, but I never waste time helping Kuno to the nurse's office  afterward."</p><p>The  pony tailed martial artist just shrugged.   It was true that after the crowd had broken up he had dragged the older  boy to the nurse's office.  "Yeah, well  who asked you to come anyway?" Ranma said lazily.</p><p>"Excuse  me for being concerned!  You didn't even  know where the nurse's office was, you jerk!"   She was only trying help, after all.   He didn't need to be an asshole about it.</p><p>There  was a long, awkward silence between the two.   Finally Ranma asked "So what was the deal with that whole fight,  anyway?"</p><p>Rolling  her eyes at the memory, the youngest Tendo sister responded "Well, at the  beginning of the semester Kuno made this speech..."</p><p>A  few months ago…</p><p>Kuno  walked across the stage of the auditorium carrying his selected speech.  He checked the microphone, and then went on  with his entry.</p><p>"The  vengeance of heaven is slow but sure.  If  you wish to ask Akane out you must prove your worth to her by defeating her in  combat!  I, Tatewaki Kuno, otherwise  known as the Shooting Star, shall permit no other terms!"</p><p>"Err...Kuno,  you do realize this is a speech contest, right?" a voice asked him from off  stage.</p><p>"Of  course," Kuno replied.  "Now let us not  waste anymore time with these lesser speeches and present my prowess with first  prize, as my speech was obviously the greatest of all."</p><p>"That's  amazing," Ranma pondered.  That guy was  really thick for setting this all up, and the boys at this school were even  worse for going along with it.</p><p>"The  worse thing is that he ended up winning the contest," Akane fumed.  "All the boys have been challenging me  since.  Especially Kuno.  And for some reason I always win."</p><p>"Kuno's  probably holding back," Ranma said lazily.</p><p>"Why  do you say that?" Akane asked bitterly.   This boy better not be implying that Kuno was  more skilled than her.</p><p>"Well,  if these guys listen to anything Kuno says then he must be pretty fierce,  right?  I mean, they get a huge beating  from you everyday, so dealing with Kuno must be way worse then fighting with  you."</p><p>Akane  growled at that.  He was suggesting that  Kuno was better then her.</p><p>"Plus,"  Ranma continued. "It's pretty unlikely that anyone who just got through beating  the hell out of a mob would win too easily over a fresh opponent.  Well, I could, but not everyone."</p><p>The  dark haired girl balled her fist at her fiancé.   "Why don't you try me for real sometime," Akane muttered.</p><p>"Didn't  we do that already?"</p><p>"I  mean without those dirty tricks you pulled last time," Akane angrily  replied.  It was, after all impossible to  vanish like he had, right?</p><p>"Those  weren't tricks," Ranma explained. He gave her an evil smile and clenched his  own fist.  "But if you really wanna fight  we can, but I ain't gonna go easy on ya like that Kuno guy..."  Cutting his statement short Ranma expression  changed to a more serious one.   "Look  out!" he shouted as he suddenly leapt into the air juts avoiding a splash of  water which seemingly came out of nowhere.</p><p>"Never, Ranma Saotome!"  Tatewaki  Kuno stood before the two teenagers holding an empty  water pale.</p><p>"What's  up, Kuno?" Ranma asked as he landed gracefully on dry hallway floor.  "Want your ass kicked again?"</p><p>"Never  will I accept this travesty of justice!"   Kuno yelled.  "Never will I accept  your engagement to the fair Akane Tendo!"</p><p>Before  Ranma or Akane could protest, their classmates suddenly appeared out of no  where.</p><p>"Engagement?"</p><p>"But  Akane, I thought you hated boys!"</p><p>"Akane,  every boy in the school is in love with you, couldn't you have left us Ranma?"</p><p>"Wow,  have you guys %#$ yet?  I've bet you've  even %#$."</p><p>"It's  not true!" Akane protested.  "Our  parents decided it, I swear!"</p><p>Ranma  wasn't too concerned however.  He needed  to concentrate on Kuno right now.</p><p>"This  is no place to fight Kuno, if you wanna fight follow me," Ranma suggested.  Kuno complied.  In an instant, the two were racing down the  hall.  The other students quickly  followed.  It wasn't like the teacher's  had any authority to stop them after all.</p><p>"Here's  a nice short cut," Ranma stated as he leapt out a seemingly random open window.</p><p>"I  follow," Kuno bellowed as he too made a leap of faith.  Unfortunately for the kendoist he was the  only one falling.  As he started  descending to the ground below.  He  noticed that Ranma was still hanging from the ledge of the window.</p><p>The  pony tailed fighter flashed a cold smile.   "Moron," Ranma exclaimed as Kuno passed him on his way to  the swimming pool.</p><p>The  students were a bit shocked to see Ranma letting Kuno fall like that.  It was a bit devious.  On the other hand it was Kuno so it didn't  bother them for very long.  Climbing back  into the hallway Ranma saw the crowd staring at him.  Giving them a "V" gesture with his fingers he  smiled and yelled out "Victory."  The  crowd all cheered (Save for Akane).</p><p>"That  was reckless," Akane warned her fiancé.   "If that pool wasn't there Kuno could have been hurt."  She didn't like Kuno or anything but even he  didn't deserve to be street pizza.</p><p>Ranma  shrugged as he walked past her, not bothering to make eye contact.  "Don't be stupid.  If there wasn't a pool there I wouldn't have  done it.  I take life very seriously;  it's just that I wanted an easy way to get rid of that jerk without having to  kill him."  Satisfied with his logic,  Ranma headed back in the direction of his class.  The crowd followed, all of them eager to  become a acquainted with the pony tailed boy.   Akane followed a well, though she grumbled most of the way to class.</p><p>Normally  Nabiki Tendo didn't spend her lunch hour socially with friends or even using it  as a well deserved break as most students did.   No, Nabiki had a business to run and couldn't afford to waste time with  such trivial concepts of friends or relaxation.   However today was special.  Kuno  had approached her once lunch began and had informed her of his latest encounter  with the mysterious Saotome who had somehow bewitched Akane Tendo.  The kendoist demanded to know everything  about the new student; he even was willing to pay a very large amount of yen  for it.  Nabiki had already told Kuno all  she knew about the pony tailed martial artiest earlier, thus in order to  receive payment she'd have to do research.   She could do a background check on Ranma, but if he really had been  traveling around Japan non-stop for ten years  there probably wouldn't be a terribly large amount of useful information.  She would have to probe the boy for  information.  She would also have to do  it herself, which was a bit of a bother.   However she, as of right now, was one Ranma's closest acquaintances in  this school, second only to his fiancée Akane.   As such he was more likely to be open with her then any of her  lackeys.  If the price that blasted Kuno  named wasn't so high she wouldn't bother, but the risk of falling asleep due to  boredom as the dumb jock Ranma told his life story was well worth the effort.</p><p>Finding  the pony tailed martial artist wasn't as easy as Nabiki had hoped.  He hadn't been sitting with Akane, though  that was understandable considering the two didn't seem to get along.  Asking around had only lead to a dead end  since no one had seen Ranma since lunch began.   Tiring herself out the Ice Queen of Furinkan High sat down on the edge  of a tree on the courtyard.  It felt nice  in the shade.  It had been a pretty warm  outside today and walking around in that heat looking for that pony-tailed  martial artist didn't exactly make Nabiki feel any better.  This was a nice spot for lunch.  Maybe another time she'd eat here herself.</p><p>"Well  well well, if it isn't my future sister-in-law," a  familiar voice called out to Nabiki from above.</p><p>The  so-called "Ice Queen" looked up to see the elusive Ranma peacefully sitting on  a branch, munching away at his bento.   "Ranma, why are you in a tree?"</p><p>Ranma  shrugged.  "People in this school are  really annoying.  They keep bugging me  about stupid things.  So I came up here  for a little privacy."</p><p>"Should  I leave you alone to whatever it is you need privacy for?" Nabiki asked  purposely adding a bit sarcasm in her voice.</p><p>Ranma  caught it, but said nothing about her tone.   "Don't worry about it.  You're not  nearly as annoying as most people in this town."</p><p>"Gee,  thanks for the compliment, Saotome," Nabiki replied lamely.</p><p>Ranma  chuckled as he snuck glances at his possible future in-law.  She was way more of a looker then her  sister.  Then again he may be biased  considering that Akane had beaten him over the head a few times.</p><p>"Anyway,  what brings you out here," Ranma queried.</p><p>She  gave her the pony tailed boy a grin. "I was looking for you actually."</p><p>"Really?  Don't tell me you want to date  me too," Ranma groaned.</p><p>'Egotistic  jerk,' Nabiki mentally growled.  She  brushed it off and continued.  "Actually  Ranma, I was hoping we could get to know each other a little better.  You know, since we're going to be family one  day soon."</p><p>The  pig tailed martial artist chuckled once again.   From the moment he met Nabiki he decided there was something about her  he didn't trust.  Upon reaching school he  had heard the rumors.  Nabiki was a money  grubbing mercenary who would sell out her own grandmother for a few yen.  Not to mention a would-be  brother-in-law.  Chances are Nabiki was  here to extract information from him.   Most likely to sell it to Kuno who had to most reason to hate him.   He had guessed that Nabiki was the one who  informed him of he and her sister's engagement, and this little interrogation  was backing up his suspicions.</p><p>'That's  fine,' Ranma thought to himself, 'As long as we don't probe too deep.'</p><p>"Sure  Nabs," Ranma said cheerfully. It was a mask and Nabiki could tell.   "But not here.  How about we discuss it over ice cream.  I passed this nice ice cream place on the way  to the dojo.  We can go there after  school."</p><p>Now  Nabiki was surprised at Ranma to say the least.   This conversation had revealed a few things about the so-called  jock.  He was good at masking his  emotions.  Very good.  Plus he was smart enough to arrange their  meeting on his own terms.  She suspected  that he knew what she was planning, but didn't seem too concerned.  Ranma Saotome was a very interesting subject.</p><p>"Alright,  I'll see you then," Nabiki said to the pony tailed martial artist as she began  walking back to the school.  She look  over her shoulder and gave him a wink, while saying "And don't call me Nabs."</p><p>Ranma  couldn't help but smile.</p><p>Meanwhile,  somewhere in Japan</p><p>Ryoga  Hibiki was lost.  That wasn't anything  abnormal.  He was always lost for the  most part.  Only when he was with his  family was did he truly feel found.  He  hadn't seen them in a year's time.</p><p>"Where  am I now?" he wondered out loud.  He had  just gotten off a rather beat up fishing boat and now was standing in the  middle of a shady looking port.  The kind  that doesn't check for ID or a passport.   Because he was always wandering Ryoga had seen this scene many times in  many different countries.  Unsure of what  country he was in this time, the lost boy decided to ask one of the passing  sailors.</p><p>"Excuse  me, sir, but what country is this?"   Ryoga asked politely.</p><p>"What,  did you fall asleep on your boat or something?"   Was the response.  "This is Japan, you idiot."</p><p>Normally  Ryoga would have punched the man out for such a remark.  However the lost boy was much too happy now  that he had returned to the land of his birth.   He calmed down so he could ask the next question.  "Where is Tokyo?"</p><p>"Umm...that  way," the man said pointing in a specific direction.</p><p>Ryoga  bowed at he man.  "Thank you."  He turned away from the man and began walking  in a totally wrong direction.  The man  could hear him mumbling something about "Meeting Ranma Saotome."</p><p>"Hey  buddy, I said this way!"</p><p>Class  was boring.  Despite the fact that Ranma  always received A's, school it was still boring.  His mother had always been strict about his  studies while they were on the road.   This however caused Ranma to be far ahead his grade level.  Rather then paying attention to what was  being taught Ranma was thinking about testing out of the freshmen class.  Of course if he did that he would be spending  more time with Kuno which wouldn't exactly be fun.  A little nap should help him think.</p><p>Akane  stole another glance at her fiancé who was by now in a deep sleep.  They guy was a jerk with no redeeming  qualities that she could find.  He was  arrogant and kind of a pervert.  Well maybe  not, she could admit that he may not be perverted, but a jerk he was.  He constantly insulted her and even had the  nerve to call her a…a…lesbian! Now he was sleeping through class!  She sighed to herself as she thought about  her current predicament.</p><p>"And  your homework for tonight is to finish reading Chapter 4, then outline it" the  teacher announced just as the bell rang.</p><p>Ranma,  hearing this, nearly leapt from his desk, but was cut off by the several  females in the class who had been waiting for their chance to talk to him.  Despite being in the center of the large  crowd he could tell that the male population, as well as Akane, were glaring at  him.  The youngest Tendo sister was still  mad at him and the boys were obviously jealous.   She quickly left the class room in disgust.  The pony tailed martial artist just shrugged.  With any luck he and his father would be  packing up and leaving the Tendo Dojo soon, so it doesn't matter what Akane  does, right?</p><p>Ranma  began making up excuses to his admirers in the hopes of escaping.  He had a feeling that Nabiki wasn't someone  who liked to wait.</p><p>On  his way out of the building Ranma instantly realized someone was about to  attack him.  Acting on instinct alone,  the pony tailed boy quickly and effortlessly dodge a barrage of attacks form  the unknown attacker who had seemingly appeared out of nowhere.  When he realized who it was he let out a  disgusted groan.  "You again? Damn it  Kuno, how many times do I have to drop you out of a third story window before  you get the hint!"</p><p>Without  stopping his attack, Kuno replied "Your tricks are no match for my prowess,  Saotome!  I shall smite thee and win the  heart of the fair Akane!"</p><p>Having  had enough of Kuno's mouth, the heir the Saotome School suddenly delivered a crushing  kick to the older boy's head causing him to be knock several feet away.  The kendoist fell to ground rather  painfully.  It was far to fast for the  average person to see it, but Kuno certainly felt it.  A crowd had gathered around the two fighters.  Ranma VS. Kuno round three had been as short  as the last two, but most of the student body couldn't get enough of seeing "Blue  Thunder" get the crap kicked out of him.</p><p>"You're  the man, Saotome!"</p><p>"He's  such a hunk!  That Akane is so lucky to  be engaged to him!"</p><p>"Did  you see how fast he laid out Kuno?"</p><p>"Man,  I thought Kuno and Akane were good fighters, but that Ranma guy is light years  ahead of them!"</p><p>Ranma  nervously regarded his "fans" as they continued cheering for him.  He smiled and waved at them while slowly  walking toward the gate, not making any sudden movement for fear the over  excited crowd may attack him.  Eventually  the heir to the pony tailed boy made his way to the front gate.  Surprisingly another familiar character was  waiting for.</p><p>"Oh,  it's you Nabiki," Ranma realized.</p><p>The  Ice Queen had been watching from the gate the whole time.  Like the rest of the student body it really  did amaze her how easily Ranma defeated the self called "Blue Thunder of  Franken High School."  She too had  figured that, with the exception of her sister, Kuno was the best fighter in  town.</p><p>The  pony tailed martial artist smiled a happy at his future sister-in-law.  "Have you been waiting long?"</p><p>Nabiki  shrugged, and return the smile.  "Not  that long, but don't worry about it. I'll put it on your tab."</p><p>"Gee  thanks," Ranma spat out as sarcastically as he could manage.  He leaned against the gate, next to where  Nabiki was standing and relaxed a little bit.   "This school is so messed up.  Psychos  with swords, an easily manipulated student body, girls who treat you like an  overnight pop sensation.  This day has  been really shitty."</p><p>Nabiki  was giggling at the misfortune of sister's fiancé, much to his annoyance. "Well  at least it can't get any worse," Akane's older sister replied.</p><p>Right  on cue a sudden shower of rain poured down suddenly on an unsuspecting  Nerima.  After two minutes it stopped,  just as mysteriously as it began.  It was  almost as if it rained just for Ranma.</p><p>The  newly female Ranma's eye narrowed.  "Son  of a bitch."</p><p>Nabiki  had suggested they get hot water from the neighborhood clinic since it was  pretty close by and the doctor who ran it was a family friend.  Once arriving there they found that the  doctor had seemingly stepped out for the moment.  The entire clinic was empty, though nothing  had been locked.</p><p>"He's  probably in his office in the back," Nabiki had told Ranma.  She had gone to look for him leaving the pony  tailed girl alone in the waiting room.</p><p>"What  a day," Ranma thought to herself.  She  was slowly beginning to hate Nerima as nothing good had happened to her since she  got there.  She had been forced into an  engagement she didn't want, and at the same time became a target of a "modern  samurai."   For now she was stuck with  Akane as a fiancée, but there had to be something she could do about Kuno.  She needed to somehow get the kendoist off  her back without hurting him too badly.   But what could he do?  As long as  she was engaged to the girl Kuno loved she may never get rid of him.</p><p>The  red haired girl's thoughts were interrupted when she suddenly felt a hand touch  her shoulder.  Acting on reflex Ranma  quickly turned around and used a defensive stance.  She calmed when she realized it was only a  skeleton being held by a smiling and seemingly harmless young man wearing  glasses.  Well older then Ranma of course  but younger then her father.  Maybe he  was around 29 or so.</p><p>The  man moved the skeleton's hand so it looked like it was waving.  "Pardon me," the bag of bones "said."</p><p>Relaxed,  Ranma too smiled.  "Wow, I'm  impressed.  No many people can sneak up  on me like that. "</p><p>"Oh,  you'll find that Betty and I have many tricks up our sleeves.  That is if Betty wore any clothes."  The man was laughing now.  Ranma felt a warm gentleness from this guy and  instantly decided that she liked him.   She too joined in the laughing</p><p>The  man with glasses offered his hand.  "Dr. Tofu Ono, at your service."</p><p>Ranma  readily shook Dr. Tofu's hand.  "Ranma  Saotome of the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial  Arts."</p><p>The  young doctor adjusted his glasses and nodded knowingly. "Anything Goes,  huh?  That's the same style that the  Tendo's use.  Any  relation?"</p><p>"Yeah,  my old man and Mr. Tendo trained together when they were younger.  Me and Pop are staying at the dojo."  She didn't bother to mention that she and  Akane were to be married.  It didn't seem  important.</p><p>At  this time Nabiki had finally returned, only to see that Ranma had apparently  met the good doctor.  "Good afternoon,  Dr. Tofu."</p><p>Tofu  at the Tendo girl once he realized that she was there.  "Good afternoon to you too Nabiki.  Can I assume that you and Ranma here came  together?"</p><p>Nerima's  resident mercenary shrugged.  "Yes  doctor.  We were actually wondering if we  could borrow some hot water."</p><p>D.  Tofu was a bit confused with the request, but was happy to comply.  Since he was about to make tea anyway it  wasn't a bother at all.  As the water heated  up the doctor attempted to make some small talk.  "So Ranma, how long will you and you father  being staying in Nerima?"</p><p>"They'll  be here for a while," Nabiki interjected.   "After all he's engaged to Akane."</p><p>Ranma  slapped her forehead.  She knew Nabiki  had said that on purpose.  Then again  it's not like she told her not to tell anyone.</p><p>Dr.  Tofu's eyes narrowed.  "He's going to marry Akane?"  He paused for a few seconds then snapped his  fingers.  "Jusenkyo?"</p><p>The  pony tailed girl laughed nervously. "Umm yeah, how'd ya guess?"</p><p>"I  sensed some trace of magic in you aura, but didn't think anything of it at the  time.  When you asked for hot water I  suspected, but once Nabiki referred to as 'he' it all made sense."</p><p>Ranma-chan  smiled at the doctor's wit.  "Nice  detective skills, Doc.  You wouldn't  happen to have a cure somewhere in here, would you?"</p><p>Dr.  Tofu sadly shook his head.    "I'm sorry, but I have never heard of a cure  for a Jusenkyo curse."</p><p>Not  seeming to mind the lack of a cure, Ranma replied "Ah well.  Hey, how do you know about the place  though?  You're the first guy I met who'  even heard its name."</p><p>Dr.  Tofu was once again smiling, admiring the good nature Ranma seemingly  possessed. "Oh you know, I used to do a bit of traveling.  You hear things like that when you're on the  road."</p><p>Ranma  could relate.  She of course had traveled  for ten years and had heard many legends and such.</p><p>Tofu  continued.  "So Ranma, you and Akane are  going to be getting married?"</p><p>"Our  dad's decided that, not us," Ranma assured.</p><p>Tofu  never lost his smile "Regardless, it's much too early for that.  Your both still  children after all."</p><p>"I  bet Akane wouldn't be too happy to hear that, Doctor," Nabiki muttered.</p><p>"What  was that, Nabiki," asked the good doctor, seemingly unable to hear all of what  the brown hair girl had said.  When  Nabiki just shook her head he let it go.</p><p>Noticing  that the water had heated up he poured a cup for his red headed guest. Ranma  quickly splashed herself with the water and reverted back to the male  side.  Tofu's eyes nearly bugged out of  his head.  "Amazing!"</p><p>"Well  I guess we'll be heading out."  The two  teens gathered their possessions and began to head out of the back rooms.  Tofu nodded understandably.  "You'll have to join me for tea one day,  Ranma.  I'd love to hear more about  Jusenkyo. You're invited as of course Nabiki."</p><p>The  two teens said their goodbyes to Dr. Tofu and took their leave.</p><p>Later  Ranma and Nabiki finally managed to get to the ice cream palor that Ranma had  mentioned ealier.  It was pretty small,  but it a nice little place.  The two  seated themselves at a small table by one of the windows and waited for someone  to take their order.</p><p>"That  Tofu guy is a martial artist, right?"   Ranma asked as he waved over a waitress after waiting a while.</p><p>Nabiki  raised an eyebrow at her future brother in law.    "As a matter of fact he is.  I couldn't tell you what style he studied  though.  That's Akane's department."</p><p>The  two briefly paused with their conversation to place their orders.  "I could tell," Ranma finally responded.  "The guy totally erased all traces of his  presence.  Like I told the doc, there  ain't too many people that can sneak up on me.   He must have had years of training to pull that off."</p><p>Nabiki  could see that Ranma had lost sight of the purpose of this outing.  "Yes Ranma, Dr. Tofu is a very interesting  subject but let's not veer off course, Saotome."  It was more direct then the Ice Queen had  originally planned, but by now she figured that it was a pointless to even try  to hide what she was really after.</p><p>The  Pony tailed martial artist shrugged. "You wanted some information , right? Ask  away, Nabs."</p><p>The  brown haired mercenary felt her left eye twitch when Ranma once again used that  nickname.  None the less she had a job to  do, regardless of how annoying it may be.</p><p>"Well  Ranma, why don't you tell me about yourself."</p><p>"There  ain't much to tell, really."</p><p>"C'mon, Saotome.  You've spent years traveling  around the country You just came back from China.  You must have something interesting to say about  yourself."</p><p>Ranma  closed his eyes and reminded silent for what seemed like hours.  After a while an eternity that lasted  only minutes he spoke.  "I guess it wouldn't hurt to give you a brief  overview of my life.  Fine, I'll start  from the beginning.</p><p>"Ten  years ago Pop decided that it was a good idea to drag me off on a training trip  that would last, well, years.  I don't  remember too much from back then but I know Pop signed some kinda deal with Mom  before we left.  Don't ask me what it was  cause I got no clue.  Anyway the purpose  of the trip was to make me the greatest martial artist of my generation.  You know, a man among men."</p><p>"That  worked out, didn't Ranma," Nabiki mocked.</p><p>The  pony tailed fighter frown at the Tendo girl's remark.  "Ah, shut up.   Anyway, as I was saying I was supposed to become a man among men.  About six months after we left home Pop and I  were staying in Kyoto.  I met one of my best friends there.  Get this, Pop tried to get me engaged to  her.  Stupid griffin."  Ranma paused at the memory of his father's  plan to steal Ukyo's father cart.  He  made a mental note to pound the old man extra hard at the next sparring  match.  He shook his head and  continued.  "After about two weeks though  Mom shows up.  Pop wasn't too happy about  that."</p><p>Nabiki  nodded.  "A mother's love would only  soften the boy."  She said this as close to  Genma voice as she could.</p><p>"You  got it!  That's exactly what Pop  said.  But Mom said that it was just  plain cruel to separate a child and his mother for the length he had suggested.  She had spent the last six months tracking us  down.  Not only that but she had a kid  with her too."</p><p>The  brown haired girl gasped.  "You mean she…"</p><p>Ranma  began to sweat and wave his arms defensively.   "No way, Mom would never do something like that!  The kid was the son of friend of hers who she  found wandering Tokyo.  He was homeless and eating out of trash cans  for God's sake, so I think it was pretty appropriate for her to keep him  around.  He stayed with us from then  on.  Pop kept putting him through stupid  and dangerous training though.  It kind  of made him pretty emotionally unstable so he got us into trouble  sometimes.  Anyway, Mom forced her way  into the training trip which was cool because Mom was a master with a  katana.  She taught me the way of the  sword while Pop taught the way of the fist."   He smirked as he thought about how versatile he was in terms of fighting.</p><p>The  conversation took a brief pause when their ice cream arrived.  "So, that's why daddy asked you if your mom  was coming last night," Nabiki realized.</p><p>"Yeah.  It was hard on us though.  Four people roaming Japan ain't practical, but we  were happy.  Until China."  Ranma paused once more.  He held a similar expression that he wore the  night before when Soun asked about his mother.</p><p>"She  died," Nabiki said with as much sincerity as possible.</p><p>Ranma  shook his head.  "She didn't just die,  she got killed.  By an amazon."</p><p>Nabiki  eyes widen.  Killed?  Amazon?   What was he getting at.</p><p>The  pony tailed boy saw her questioning gaze.   "In the Bayankala mountains of the  Xinghai Province in China there's a village called Joketsuzoku.  It's near  Jusenkyo.  It's inhabited by a female  dominated society that call themselves amazons.   It's weird, I know, but remember you're talking to a guy who magically  turns into a girl."</p><p>The  middle Tendo girl nodded.  "Okay, so  these amazons' killed your mom?"</p><p>"One  of 'em did.   They got this crazy rule that if you defeat them in combat then they  kill you.  I wasn't there when it  happened but I was told that Mom beat an amazon in a fight and later the…the bitch  poisoned her!  She didn't even have the  guts to face her head on!"  Ranma had  become emotional and had to stopped while came back to himself.</p><p>Nabiki  too had lost her mother, but even so she couldn't relate to a person had lost  theirs in such a way.  She had begun to  see what made the young man tick.</p><p>Having  calmed down Ranma continued.  "After that  me and Pop headed to Jusenkyo, and well, you know the  rest."</p><p>"But  did you ever find the killer?"</p><p>"No.  All I found out is that she was some kind of  rouge amazon who got booted out the village.   But if I ever meet that chick…"</p><p>Nabiki  decided to quickly change the topic.  The  topic of his mother's killer was off limits.   "What ever happened to that other guy you were traveling with?"</p><p>"Oh him?  After we buried Mom he went off  to train by himself.  He took it really  hard, you know.  But he knows where Pop  and I are, so he'll turn up sooner or later.   Hell, he'll probably show up when we least expect it."</p><p>By  this time both of them had finished their ice cream.  Since Ranma's story was done, more or less,  there was no reason to stay.  The pony  tailed martial, believing that it was the man's duty to pay the bill, pulled  out a wad of cash and placed enough on the table to cover the meal and tip.  Of course this didn't escape Nabiki  attention.  Instantly her "Money Sense"  began tingling.</p><p>"That's  a lot of cash you got there Saotome,"  Nabiki noticed as she desperately  tried not to seem too interested.</p><p>Ranma  smiled cheerfully and innocently.  "Heh,  heh, I won a few tournaments over the last ten years."</p><p>They  headed out of the parlor.  Kasumi would  be getting a bit worried if they didn't back to the dojo soon. As the two  headed back home, Ranma turned to Nabiki and, with the most cheerful and happy  face you would ever see, said point blank "So now that you know a little bit  more about me go ahead and sell the info the Kuno or any other idiot out  there.  Since I left all the important  stuff I really don't care.  Later."  With that the pony tailed boy lepta onto a  nearby roof.  He stuck his tongue out as  a final insult then quickly hoped away, rooftop to rooftop leaving a bewildered  Nabiki alone.</p><p>"What  the hell...just happened here?"</p><p>Despite  the fact that she had just heard his life story, Ranma Saotome was still a  mystery wrapped in an enigma to her.</p><p>To  be Continued…</p><p>Author's  Note:   Holy crap, this chapter  sucked!  There was supposed to be more  but I think we can all agree that it's too long as it is.  First of all let me address all the nice  people who reviewed the last chapter.   Thank you for the kind words of encouragement.  It really motivated me.  There's a few things I'd like quickly mention.  I wrote the last chapter about a year ago and  at the time I just hated Akane with a vengeance.  These days I realize that's she's really not  all that bad.  So I'm going to go easy  with the girl and try not to be such an Akane basher.  Also, you may have noticed that I refer to  Ranma's hair as having a pony tail rather then a pig tail.  The fact is that this Ranma never encountered  the dragon whisker and thus never got the curse on his hair.  He still had the hair style he had when he  first fell into Spring of Drowned Girl.   Finally, some of you asked who Tenma could be.  You know, I don't know.  Perhaps we'll find out together in the next  chapter. Or not.  Probably not.</p><p>Revision  Note:  Just cleaned it up.</p><p>Next  Chapter:  Ranma faces Kuno (Again), more  on the home life of the Tendos/Saotomes, and a certain lost boy makes his  debut.</p>
