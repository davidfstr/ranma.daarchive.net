</div>A tall, dark-haired woman walked in to the main room<br/>of the bar section of Club Luna and stretched<br/>languidly with a small smile on her face. It was<br/>about time for a good vacation back among the teeming<br/>mortal masses. She strode through the main room,<br/>appreciating the looks she was drawing from the<br/>assorted women in the bar. Aside from the woman with<br/>the blood-red hair in the manager's uniform behind the<br/>bar.<br/>She expected that however, the facial markings made<br/>her stand out almost as much as her hair. And Hecate<br/>had always given the impression that she was inured to<br/>the shocks of physical beauty. Being the daughter of<br/>the Lord of the Dead must have had something to do<br/>with it. What was unusal was that the woman's gaze<br/>was directed toward a specific spot.<br/>The dark-haired woman turned to follow the path of<br/>Hecate's gaze and finally settled on a young "woman"<br/>with died green hair sitting at the bar. She frowned<br/>as she recognized an aura about her and started to<br/>make a beeline for her. She was surprised to be<br/>stopped by the woman with blood red hair, not even<br/>having seen her move.<br/>"That isn't a woman, Hecate" the dark haired woman<br/>said softly in ancient greek. "That's someone that<br/>fell in a pool from my grove."<br/>"I know," Hecate replied, ignoring the other woman's<br/>expression of disbelief. "Special case, Artemis."<br/>"What kind of special case," Artemis asked.<br/>"He's hurt," Hecate said. "In a way I haven't been<br/>able to check yet. We're goddesses, we're supposed to<br/>be easing human suffering, I'd say he was brought for<br/>a reason. Other than that however..."<br/>"What else?" Artemis asked. "Is his curse locked so<br/>he's permanently a girl?"<br/>"No," Hecate said. "He's Kishijoten's descendant, if<br/>you can't see the resemblance, and remember who holds<br/>the lease on this place."<br/>"He stays," Artemis ascertained reluctantly. Hecate<br/>smiled.<br/>"I thought I'd have to engage in drastic measures for<br/>a moment," Hecate said. "I'd love to stay here with<br/>you, but I have duties to attend to. I'll see you<br/>when you get home." She kissed Artemis on the cheek<br/>and started to fade into the crowd.<br/>"What do you mean by drastic measures?" Artemis<br/>asked, grumbling as Hecate had already vanished.<br/>Having a medium like crowds made for some confusing<br/>exits at times. All of Hecate's family was like that,<br/>coming and going silently. Here one minute gone the<br/>next, no fanfare or lights, just, poof. Though<br/>Artemis could have sworn she'd caught the edge of a<br/>smile before Hecate vanished completely.<p>*****<p>"It's better this way, Ranma," Akane said, with a<br/>radiant smile as she stroked Ranma's hair. Ranma<br/>sighed as that hand stroked down to her face.<br/>"Kind of crowded tonight, isn't it?"<p>*****<p>"Huh?" Ranma said, snapping out of her memories with<br/>a shiver and turning to look at her side. One of the<br/>other women was talking to her. "What did you say?"<br/>"I asked if you thought it was pretty crowded<br/>tonight," the woman said.<br/>"I've never been here before," Ranma answered. "I<br/>wouldn't know."<br/>"Oh," the woman said. She was just a few years older<br/>than Ranma, with hair so black that Ranma thought it<br/>must have been dyed just like her own green hair. "I<br/>thought I'd seen you here before. Good to know."<br/>"Huh, why?" Ranma asked.<br/>"I really wouldn't have liked to overlook such a<br/>beauty as you," she said, reaching out to brush at a<br/>lock of Ranma's hair. A fingernail trailed along her<br/>forehead. Ranma gasped and swallowed looking into the<br/>woman's eyes. She looked away and missed the slight<br/>shift of Ranma's pupils, and they'd shifted back by<br/>the time the woman had turned back. "This is a good<br/>song, want to come dancing."<br/>"Umm, no that's fine," Ranma said.<br/>"You're new at this, aren't you, honey?" the woman<br/>asked with a knowing grin. Ranma's blank, confused<br/>stare was answer enough for her. "I'll give you some<br/>time to get used to the place. I'm Keiko."<br/>"Ranma," Ranma answered.<br/>"Well," Keiko stood up and leaned forward torward<br/>Ranma. "I'll see you later, Ranma." She brushed over<br/>Ranma's hand, smiling at the flinch, and then vanished<br/>into the dance crowd. Ranma turned back to face front<br/>and shivered.<br/>"What was that about," she asked herself.<br/>"Are you going to order anything?' the bartender<br/>asked. She was a dark-haired woman with facial<br/>tattoos that was scowling down at him.<br/>"Just a soda, please," Ranma said, looking rather<br/>nervous at the sight of an angry woman.<br/>"What brings you to this place?" the bartender asked,<br/>and Ranma still hadn't noticed that she was wearing a<br/>manager's business suit rather than a front room<br/>uniform. A silvery sparkle seemed to surround the<br/>woman, and for some reason, Ranma felt she should be<br/>honest with her.<br/>"Nabiki says to relax and forget about Akane," Ranma<br/>said. "She thinks Akane's gonna hurt me or something,<br/>or that I'll end up like Kodachi."<br/>"Like Kodachi?" the woman repeated. Ranma nodded.<p>*****<p>"OHHHH, HO HO HO HO HO!" a strange winged figure<br/>declared as it landed in the Tendo courtyard.<br/>She turned her face, adorned with a pair of small<br/>black horns curling out of her forehead. Her jet<br/>black hair and eyes, as well as the horns and wings,<br/>contrasted wonderfully with the alabaster skin and<br/>bright white teeth with pointed canines. She was<br/>wearing a modified version of her St. Hebereke's<br/>outfit. Designed to fit the wings, which had come back<br/>unlooked for.<br/>"Oh, Nabiki Tendo, where is the mistress." Nabiki<br/>and Kasumi were staring at Kodachi in stark terror.<br/>"What happened to you?" Nabiki demanded, blinking her<br/>eyes. "When did you change back!"<br/>"Isn't it magnificient?" Kodachi asked. "I found a<br/>mage who was willing and capable of again giving me<br/>that form with which the Mistress graced me!" Kodachi<br/>flapped her bat wings and sighed pleasantly as she<br/>gazed heavenward. A look of relief passed both<br/>Tendos' faces. "I could provide you with the address<br/>if you would like..."<br/>"No!" both elder Tendos declared.<br/>"I mean..." Kasumi said. "That is to say that I<br/>prefer my current, human, flesh and blood body."<br/>"I'd rather not be nature-girl again," Nabiki added.<br/>Kasumi looked over the almost not there outfit Nabiki<br/>was wearing, and considered the almost not there<br/>outfit she'd given Ranma. But she didn't say<br/>anything.<br/>"As you wish," Kodachi said, shrugging with a<br/>confused look on her face. "Is the mistress here?"<br/>"She is..." Kasumi started as Kodachi passed a small<br/>stack of bills to Nabiki who started counting them.<br/>"...upstairs in her room, doing homework," Nabiki<br/>said.<br/>"Nabiki!" Kasumi gasped.<br/>"Thank you, Nabiki Tendo, now I must attend to the<br/>mistress," Kodachi said as she headed for the stairs.<br/>"Mistress Tendo! Your loyal and competent slave has<br/>come to attend to your will!"<br/>"AHHH!" Akane shouted from upstairs while Nabiki<br/>and Kasumi stared up. "NABIKI! You told her where I<br/>was again!"<br/>"Have I displeased you, mistress?" Kodachi shouted.<br/>"You must discipline me immediately."<br/>"How'd you get the bloody wings back!"<br/>There was a crash that had to be Akane jumping out<br/>her window since she landed in the courtyard and took<br/>off running, a flying succubus close behind her<br/>professing her undying devotion to her mistress, and<br/>carrying an overnight bag in one hand and a pair of<br/>cuffs in the other.<br/>"I suppose this means she'll miss dinner," Kasumi<br/>said.<br/>"I'd credit Akane's protests a lot more if she didn't<br/>still have that bag in her room," Nabiki thought, not<br/>saying it outloud to avoid getting into another<br/>argument with her elder sister.<p>*****<p>"Yeah," Ranma said. "Followin' Akane around like<br/>little puppy an' stuff. Nabiki don't understand me<br/>and Koda-chan, she just got kissed." Her voice<br/>started to get dreamy. "She doesn't know what it was<br/>like...how SHE made us feel..." Ranma's head started<br/>to loll to the side and her eyes almost faded into<br/>space before she flinched and shook her head. "Even<br/>knowin' better, even when Akane's just Akane<br/>again...Nabiki can be angry at her...I can't be...I<br/>don't think I ever can be again. Don't know why I'm<br/>telling ya this."<br/>The bartender's hard face softened fractionally and<br/>she handed Ranma a large glass of soda. Ranma almost<br/>thought he saw a flash of light or something as the<br/>woman's hand passed over the cup, but he had to have<br/>been seeing things.<br/>"Perhaps it is just being a bartender," the woman<br/>said. "We're supposed to provoke a desire to talk."<br/>"Thought that was the alcohol that did that," Ranma<br/>muttered.<p>*****<p>"I found toy number one for this evening," Keiko<br/>whispered in English to her dance partner. The other<br/>was a gaijin woman, a bleached-blonde aerobics<br/>bombshell.<br/>"Really?" the blonde asked, slipping her hand over<br/>Keiko's rear end. "Where?"<br/>"At the bar, Sara," Keiko said. "Green hair, about<br/>twenty years old."<br/>"Mmmm," Sara said looking in that direction and<br/>catching a brief glimpse through the crowd of people.<br/>"Nice figure."<br/>"Very sensitive," Keiko said, smiling. "Shy,<br/>innocent, first timer. Probably not even completely<br/>out of the closet yet."<br/>"She'll break easy," Sara said reluctantly. "But<br/>cherries are rare to find. Now we need someone a<br/>little more domineering for number two."<br/>"Shouldn't take too long," Keiko smiled.<p>*****<p>"Please don't make a scene, Ayeka," Kiyone said.<br/>"Minagi and I would like to be able to come back here<br/>again."<br/>"Make a scene?" Ayeka repeated. She was dressed in a<br/>long, blue silk party dress with sphaghetti straps.<br/>It was hugging her body rather tightly, but it covered<br/>what she felt needed covering. "How can I possibly<br/>make any more of scene out of this situation?"<br/>"By yelling and screaming and loudly berating<br/>everyone you see," Kiyone said.<br/>"I rarely behave this way, is that not right Minagi?"<br/>Ayeka asked, turning to the other girl.<br/>"Ano, please don't ask me to take sides here," Minagi<br/>said quietly.<br/>"Let's just go in and get on to having fun," Kiyone<br/>said. "Or at least, tolerating fun."<br/>"Hmph," Ayeka said.<br/>"Kiyo, Mina," the doorwoman said as Kiyone and Minagi<br/>came to the door. "Good to see you again, who's your<br/>friend?"<br/>"Aunty Ayeka," Minagi said dryly. "Kiyo-chan thought<br/>it would be a good idea to bring her with us this<br/>time." The doorwoman nodded understandingly, as in<br/>she saw it was obvious that Minagi did not truly agree<br/>with her girlfriend, and let them in.<br/>"I think there's a few tables empty," she said as<br/>they passed her. Ayeka passed, hmphing. After they<br/>were inside she mumbled something that sounded<br/>sarcastically. "They look so cute when they're being<br/>jerks."<p>*****<p>"Well, I don't see a table," Kiyone said. "Minagi?"<br/>"I'm looking," she said. "Let me make a circuit and<br/>get right back."<br/>She vanished from sight as she teleported further on.<br/>Ayeka started to protest, but Kiyone cut her off.<br/>Truly, with the loud music, flashing lights and crowds<br/>of people it was hardly possible to notice Minagi's<br/>mode of transportation if you weren't looking for it.<br/>She finally appeared, standing on a table Ayeka<br/>noticed with a disapproving frown, and waving them<br/>over.<br/>"She found one," Kiyone said. "Let's go meet her."<br/>"Fine," Ayeka said in a long suffering tone. She<br/>glanced around the room a little more closely, eyes<br/>wide as she looked around at the women dancing<br/>together, or engaging in light cuddling. Here and<br/>there an inebriated couple, or perhaps they were just<br/>full of each other, were kissing passionately,<br/>possibly in preparation of retiring to an apartment or<br/>room.<br/>It was not, as Ayeka had expected to find, wall to<br/>wall sex between women with perversity being the<br/>standing theme. In fact, it was very like what she<br/>expected from a normal bar. Only there were no men<br/>inside.<br/>"How very...interesting," Ayeka said, looking<br/>decidedly more confused than interested.<p>*****<p>"Mmmm," Sara said. "I want her." She pointed to<br/>where Ayeka had walked in.<br/>"She's coming in with that cop and her girlfriend,"<br/>Keiko said. "But maybe we can get her on her own.<br/>Are you sure?"<br/>"Oh yes," Sara said. "She'll be fun toy for this<br/>weekend. The perfect companion piece to your quiet<br/>little piece of fluff at the bar."<p>*****<p>Meanwhile back in Nerima, Akane was trying to catch<br/>her breath, hiding in a corner of the closed Furinkan<br/>gym.<br/>"I think I lost her," she sighed in relief. Which<br/>was about when something black and white tackled her.<br/>"MISTRESS!" Kodachi declared with glee. "I found<br/>you!"<br/>"Oh for goodness sake!" Akane declared. "Kodachi!<br/>Let go of me!" She fought her way out of Kodachi's<br/>grips and started to leave.<br/>"Please, mistress," Kodachi said. Akane froze, the<br/>despair was clear in Kodachi's voice.<br/>She remembered hearing it from Ranma the last time<br/>she spoke to him. Coming from Kodachi it had a little<br/>more effect for some reason. She refused to believe<br/>that it was because Ranma had broken the lilin sphere.<br/>She certainly couldn't be angry at him for giving her<br/>soul back and for taking away her sl...that demon.<br/>She sighed and looked back at Kodachi gazing at her<br/>hopefully from on her knees, wings drooping.<br/>"I'm your mistress, right?" Akane demanded. Kodachi<br/>nodded eagerly. "Then I command you to..." Kodachi<br/>slumped again and Akane could just see the thoughts<br/>going through her head.<br/>~She's going to send me away like she did Ranma,~<br/>Kodachi was thinking. Akane assumed so, and her will<br/>faltered. Life was getting more and more frustrating,<br/>and just breaking bricks wasn't helping anymore.<br/>Besides, it was rather intoxicating to have Kodachi,<br/>of all people, waiting on her every whim. Did she<br/>really want to give that up? And all she had to do to<br/>keep was treat Kodachi like a sex toy every so often<br/>when the "slave" urge came over her.<br/>It wasn't that she enjoyed bossing anyone around, it<br/>was just...well, it was a game, right? Kodachi played<br/>it. Nevermind that Kodachi had had the game pretty<br/>much hard-wired into her, and wasn't as mentally<br/>resilient as Ranma. It was just a game.<br/>"Give me the bag," Akane said finally. Kodachi<br/>squealed in delight and hopped up to give Akane the<br/>bag. Akane instantly flashed a fist out to strike<br/>Kodachi's face and send her sprawling to the ground.<br/>"I didn't say you could stand up, now just sit there<br/>like a good slave and wait for me."<br/>"Hai, mistress," Kodachi said cheerfully. Akane<br/>paused for a moment and pulled down from the persona<br/>of the mistress for a moment.<br/>"Uhh...Kodachi," she said. "Do you remember how to<br/>bind the wings?"<br/>"Uhhh..." Kodachi paused in thought.<br/>"Oh, forget it," Akane said. She set down the bag<br/>and strode over to Kodachi purposefully.<br/>Kodachi had to time to blink before she was roughly<br/>picked up from the ground and kissed hard as Akane<br/>started stripping off her clothes. Her wings<br/>fluttered as Akane pulled her in to a firm embrace.<br/>She was about to return the hug when she felt the cuff<br/>go around her wrists and lock them behind her back.<br/>"Now, let's see what the little demoness is hiding<br/>under all these clothes," Akane said, smiling down at<br/>Kodachi. Kodachi took in a breath and then felt a<br/>hand over her mouth. "No noise, Kodachi, but<br/>then...you have difficulty with that don't you?<br/>Better get something else."<br/>She stood up dragging Kodachi up with her by the<br/>handcuffs and walked back to the bag, kneeling down,<br/>taking Kodachi with her, she searched through the bag<br/>until she found a ball gag and fitted the<br/>succubus-look-alike with it.<br/>"There we go," Akane said sunnily. "No noise now,<br/>right Kodachi?" Kodachi shook her head. "I can't<br/>hear you, what did you say?"<br/>Kodachi shook her head again, and seemed to be trying<br/>to talk around the gag. Akane slapped her and then<br/>tsked with her finger.<br/>"I said no noise?" Akane said. "Right?" Kodachi<br/>froze, looking uncertain. Akane slapped her again.<br/>"Well, did I say no noise? Yes or no?" Kodachi<br/>nodded. "Is that yes, I said no noise, or yes you<br/>should make noise."<br/>Kodachi blinked and tried to think of how to answer<br/>the question. In her hesitation, Akane slapped her<br/>again. There was a sharp pain in her chest as well,<br/>but that had been there since before they started, and<br/>she faded it out of the background.<br/>"Well," Akane said. "Answer me. Should you make<br/>noise?" Kodachi very slowly shook her head and then<br/>squinted her eyes. "Good, now we can get started."<br/>There was a slight look of disappoint in Kodachi's<br/>face for a moment. Then Akane was slipping a hand<br/>under her skirt and caressing her. Kodachi closed her<br/>eyes and moaned pleasantly. Her eyes jerked open when<br/>Akane pulled back hard on her ponytail.<br/>"No noise, Koda-chan," Akane said, smiling. "Until I<br/>tell you otherwise." So saying Akane bent down to<br/>kiss the hollow of Kodachi's throat, pulling down<br/>firmly on her ponytail until that hand was also<br/>supporting the winged girl's back. Akane was still<br/>running fingers over the cloth of Kodachi's panties,<br/>at least until she ripped them off and entered<br/>Kodachi.<br/>The gymnast bit down hard on the ball in her mouth to<br/>avoid making any sort of noise as Akane vigorously<br/>struck her fingers into the gymnast and applied them<br/>skillfully. Not as skillfully as the demon had when<br/>Akane had been possessed, but she was getting better.<br/>Kodachi liked Akane better this way anyway. If the<br/>demon came back, she'd be at her call instantly, but<br/>Kodachi hoped it never came back. And she hoped Akane<br/>stayed her mistress.<br/>Akane brought her closer and closer to release until<br/>she was on the very edge and then, suddenly. Akane<br/>stopped and pulled away from Kodachi.<br/>"Well, it's obvious you're not interested in this,"<br/>Akane said. "You're making absolutely no noise."<br/>Kodachi stared at Akane and pleaded with her eyes<br/>desparately. "I can't understand you with that thing<br/>your mouth, Kodachi." Akane reached over and undid<br/>the ball gag.<br/>"Please, mistress," Kodachi said instantly. "Please<br/>I'll..." Akane slapped her.<br/>"I didn't say you could make any noise yet," Akane<br/>said. Kodachi paused, looking at Akane's smirking<br/>face as the girl reached a hand back to rub at her ass<br/>and the other began to undo buttons on her shirt.<br/>"NOW you can make noise, and it had better be a lot of<br/>noise."<br/>"Hai, mistress," Kodachi said. Then Akane was<br/>pleasuring her again and Kodachi turned all her focus<br/>to her mistress's edict. And the gym rang with her<br/>cries.<br/>Finally, the cuffs undone and thrown next to the bag<br/>with the ball gag, Kodachi was curled up next to<br/>Akane, their clothes tossed around the gym. The girl<br/>was smiling quietly as she lay against her mistress,<br/>entangled with her.<br/>~I'm not a pervert,~ Akane thought to herself.<br/>~This'll go away soon it's just sort of left over from<br/>the possession, has to be. I'm not a pervert. There<br/>is no way I could enjoy this. Kodachi and I will be<br/>back to hating each other's guts soon.~<br/>"Thank you, mistress," Kodachi whispered quietly,<br/>half-asleep. Akane stroked her hair and nodded.<br/>Akane frowned as she noted a bruise that she had not<br/>given Kodachi.<br/>"Where'd you get this?" Akane asked, fingering it<br/>carefully. It was just under Kodachi's breasts, she<br/>had not noticed it before, she'd been sort of<br/>distracted.<br/>"My brother, seems to believe that this body is more<br/>than just a physical form," Kodachi said. "He<br/>believes that I am responsible for corrupting you and<br/>Ranma-chan. It is nothing, mistress."<br/>"Kodachi, how could you want to anything with this?"<br/>Akane asked, concerned. "Your ribs are cracked."<br/>"I am fine mistress," Kodachi assured her. "I wanted<br/>to show you my new body."<br/>"Kodachi," Akane said, sitting up. "Take care of<br/>yourself first. Come on, we're going to see Dr. Tofu<br/>and then we're having a talk with your brother."<br/>"My brother is not very talkative right now," Kodachi<br/>said, smiling darkly. "You might say he's sort of<br/>tied up at the moment. I'm sure Mr. Turtle is keeping<br/>him company however. Really, mistress, he has done<br/>worse to me when we're sparring."<br/>"Okay," Akane said, still only vaguely used to<br/>Kodachi's concept of pain as something to be enjoyed.<br/>"But we're still going to Dr. Tofu's." Kodachi opened<br/>her mouth. "That's an order."<br/>"As you wish, mistress," Kodachi said.
