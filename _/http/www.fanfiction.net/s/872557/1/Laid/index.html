</div>"Why, praytell, have you called me to this place?"<br/>Ayeka demanded. Kiyone glanced over at her and arched<br/>an eyebrow. "This place" was the apartment she shared<br/>with Mihoshi.<br/>"You and I have to have a talk," Kiyone said,<br/>collecting a tray of snacks and heading out to join<br/>her friend in the living room.<br/>"About what?" Ayeka demanded. "Make yourself plain?"<br/>"You and Ryoko have come to an arrangement, soon,"<br/>Kiyone said.<br/>"What sort of arrangement should I come to with<br/>that..." Ayeka paused, flicking her dress with<br/>unnecessary force and straightening her back.<br/>"...monster woman."<br/>"Just mention her name and you get excited," Kiyone<br/>said, shaking her head.<br/>"Excuse me!" Ayeka gasped, standing straight up.<br/>"Are you suggesting that I...and<br/>that...thing...have...a RELATIONSHIP?"<br/>"For goodness sake, I just said 'excited!'" Kiyone<br/>said irritably. "Sit down and hear me out."<br/>"You had better begin to make sense, Officer Makibi,"<br/>Ayeka said harshly.<br/>"Let me give you a rundown of a rather common<br/>sequence of events," Kiyone said. "Ryoko teases you,<br/>you overreact and insult her, she insults you, there's<br/>a fight, lots of fireworks. I...I...I..." each repeat<br/>of the word was more emphatic. "Have to..." Kiyone<br/>held up her hand and started ticking off fingers.<br/>"Clean up the mess, deal with the locals, deal with<br/>the MIB," she paused and started a small side rant.<br/>"Are you aware that aliens and supernatural beings<br/>have been in Japan long enough that more than NINETY<br/>percent of the population is IMMUNE to neuralization?<br/>This is a statistic that I am given roughly THREE<br/>TIMES A WEEK! It's almost as bad as San<br/>Francisco! Or even ATLANTA! Which brings up the<br/>trigger happy cat-girl and her sisters that came by<br/>yesteday. Anyway...THEN I have to deal with my<br/>superiors, and FINALLY deal with your parents! This<br/>has been happening nearly twice a week in the two or<br/>three years since we came here. To top it all off,<br/>your fights attract more galatic criminals than I<br/>anything else I can imagine, and that's when TENCHI<br/>gets involved."<br/>Kiyone's voice started to raise to levels she usually<br/>reserved for Mihoshi, and Ayeka blinked as she leaned<br/>back, slightly nervous.<br/>"I swear, being stationed near the three of you would<br/>make being partnered with Mihoshi look like the<br/>assignment from heaven if it weren't for the fact that<br/>SHE'S here too!"<br/>"And what about Washu?" Ayeka asked faintly.<br/>"She works in a sub-dimension," Kiyone says.<br/>"Barring Mihoshi incidents she has less impact on the<br/>world at large than a salami sandwich." Actually that<br/>made her nervous, she was certain Washu would<br/>eventually get bored and try something big.<br/>"And why," Ayeka asked. "Isn't Ryoko here?"<br/>"Because the problem isn't with her," Kiyone said.<br/>"The problem is with you."<br/>"And how is that?" Ayeka asked. "Should I just<br/>abandon my claim on Lord Tenchi and give her an open<br/>passage?"<br/>"Tenchi," Kiyone said. "Will have two wives once he<br/>takes the throne, assuming he takes the throne. So<br/>there is no need to abandon your claim on him. Tenchi<br/>can't decide between you because he loves you both.<br/>Ryoko wouldn't mind sharing, would actually appreciate<br/>it, but isn't about to give up."<br/>"How would Ryoko appreciate, 'sharing' as you put<br/>it?" Ayeka asked.<br/>"You have her wrapped around your finger as surely as<br/>Tenchi does," Kiyone said. "And are just as aware of<br/>it."<br/>"I have no idea what you're talking about," Ayeka<br/>said, putting her nose in the air.<br/>"Exactly," Kiyone said. "I can't count the number of<br/>times I could swear you made a pass at her. Then you<br/>shoot her down when she responds. And it's worse when<br/>you're both drunk. She gets emotional and you get<br/>mean. Do you even remember how many times you've<br/>brought her to tears during those drinking binges in<br/>the baths?"<br/>"Binge?" Ayeka protested, not answering the question.<br/>"I don't binge."<br/>"Right," Kiyone said. "Now the way I see it, you<br/>either truly have desire toward her at all," Kiyone<br/>thought that doubtful. "Or else you are so<br/>uncomfortable with the thought that you'd rather<br/>sabotage any conversation you have Ryoko than risk<br/>proving it to yourself."<br/>"I am not attracted to Ryoko," Ayeka snapped. "Or<br/>any woman! It is untoward in a Jurain princess." At<br/>that Kiyone fixed her with a look.<br/>"Your mother and Lady Funaho," Kiyone said simply.<br/>"How dare you suggest such a thing," Kiyone gasped.<br/>"Since they admitted it, and told me you walked in on<br/>them once," Kiyone said.<br/>"It is a dreadful lie," Ayeka said. "I'll hear no<br/>more of it."<br/>"Fine, fine," Kiyone said. "Whatever. In any case,<br/>straight, bi, lesbian, whatever. You don't have to<br/>have sex with Ryoko for her to be the other wife."<br/>Ayeka blinked as if she had never considered that<br/>before. "But telling her you have no interest would<br/>at least be fair. Not to mention stop leading her<br/>on."<br/>"I am not leading her on," Ayeka protested again.<br/>"Whatever," Kiyone said waving that off.<br/>"Incidentally, I'd say she'd be a better First Empress<br/>than Second."<br/>"And why is that?" Ayeka decided.<br/>"Take a moment to consider Ryoko's idea of covert,"<br/>Kiyone said. The image of a sevveral large explosions<br/>came to mind. "Do you really think she'd make a good<br/>Head of Security? Head of the Military should suit<br/>her fine."<br/>"True," Ayeka admitted. "She is much better at brute<br/>force, isn't she." Kiyone leaned forward.<br/>"That is at least concession in the right direction,"<br/>Kiyone said. "Now, on to my plan for the night."<br/>"Your plan?" Ayeka repeated.<br/>"Right," Kiyone said. "Mihoshi is out on patrols,<br/>I'm off duty, and Minagi is coming down to visit..."<br/>"Yes, two days from now," Ayeka said. Kiyone smirked<br/>and raised a finger.<br/>"That, is what she told everybody else," Kiyone said.<br/>Ayeka's mouth dropped open.<br/>"You said you weren't interested in women!" Ayeka<br/>accused.<br/>"Did I?" Kiyone asked. "I don't remember that."<br/>"You," Ayeka growled. "But Minagi...?" She looked<br/>confused.<br/>"Looks like Ryoko, and isn't in love with you and<br/>Tenchi," Kiyone said. "And as easy as it is to play<br/>with Ryoko's heart strings...I don't feel like<br/>becoming the fourth of a quartet."<br/>"You're with Minagi because she looks like Ryoko?"<br/>Ayeka said, narrowing her eyes.<br/>"Well, at first yeah," Kiyone admitted. "But she's<br/>got a lot of other great...and that's really not your<br/>business so, now, on to my plan..."<br/>"I'm not interested," Ayeka said, putting her nose in<br/>the air, and failing to push the vulnerability Kiyone<br/>had displayed."<br/>"Then why aren't you leaving?" Kiyone asked. Ayeka<br/>flashed her eyes in Kiyone's direction. "So, anyway,<br/>I'm taking Minagi dancing tonight, in about thirty<br/>minutes. We're going to a club, and you're coming<br/>with us. At the very least, you can learn how to turn<br/>down offers without insulting smeone's age, species,<br/>intelligence, personality, parentage, strengths,<br/>weaknesses, social status, children (not a favorite<br/>one of mine either of late) or hair-color." As Kiyone<br/>ticked off points Ayeka winced. "Did I catch them<br/>all?"<br/>"Finances?" Ayeka said weakly.<br/>"Oh yes," Kiyone said. "Financial status, another<br/>no-no when politely turning someone down so that they<br/>don't feel quite hurt and confused and decide to<br/>retaliate starting a fight that destroys Tokyo Tower."<br/>"That was only our fault three times," Ayeka<br/>protested. She took a moment to catch her breath.<br/>"So you hope to teach me to treat that..." Kiyone<br/>gave her a look. "Treat Ryoko a little more<br/>politely."<br/>"At least," Kiyone said. ~If I'm really lucky you'll<br/>get laid, but how lucky am I ever.~ Speaking of<br/>which, there was a flaw in her master plan here, she<br/>knew it, but she couldn't quite lay hold of it. Then<br/>the doorbell rang, and Kiyone walked over to the door<br/>and opened it to let Minagi in.<br/>The youngest Hakubi greeted Kiyone with a passionate<br/>kiss driving her back into the apartment and shutting<br/>the door behind them. Until she caught sight of<br/>Ayeka's disapproving face.<br/>"Oh don't stop now," Kiyone muttered as Minagi broke<br/>off.<br/>"Uh, Kiyo-chan," Minagi asked faintly.<br/>"Hmmm?" Kiyone asked dreaminly, kissing at Minagi's<br/>neck.<br/>"What's Aunty Ayeka doing here?" Minagi asked.<br/>"She's going dancing with us," Kiyone answered.<br/>"Sort of a lesson in tolerance for her."<br/>"Won't she tell Ryoko?" Minagi whispered, hopefully<br/>low enough that Ayeka couldn't hear. Kiyone froze.<br/>Yep, there was that flaw in the plan. Kiyone glanced<br/>over to Ayeka, where the princess was sitting with her<br/>eyes averted.<br/>~Jsut have to make sure she stays too busy,~ Kiyone<br/>thought, breaking fully away from Minagi who took a<br/>sort of attention stance. "Okay, we have to get ready<br/>now. Ayeka, you need to change clothes. Something<br/>more normal to Earth, I have some stuff that should<br/>fit you in my room."<br/>"Obviously it has been your plan all along to see me<br/>in revealing clothing," Ayeka accused the both of<br/>them. So saying she strolled defiantly into Kiyone's<br/>room to change clothes.<br/>As soon as Ayeka was gone Minagi hit Kiyone upside<br/>the head. Kiyone flashed a what shrug in her<br/>direction, and Minagi gestured irritably toward the<br/>room Ayeka had just walked into. This was followed by<br/>the patented, "seemed like a good idea at the time"<br/>shrug and the "great, now what" eye rolling.<p>*****<p>At the Club Luna, a green haired woman approached the<br/>bar and asked for the phone. The bartender politely<br/>pointed to the end of the bar and the young woman<br/>strode for it purposefully. She was a rather small,<br/>elf-like woman with an odd, almost masculine stride.<br/>As if that stride were her true habit and it the<br/>feminine glide she'd been using was an act that was<br/>falling apart as she grew more irritated.<br/>She was dressed in a green mini-skirt and a tight<br/>green-leather blouse with no sleeves and thin<br/>shoulderstraps. It reminded the wearer of a less<br/>expansive version of that Xina chick's armor on TV.<br/>She was actually fairly glad there were no guys around<br/>to look at her, because the outfit left little to<br/>imagine about her assetts.<br/>She was wearing a pair of high heels, a form of<br/>footware she had long ago decided was the bane of her<br/>existance. And above them a pair of lower-leg<br/>wrappings, in green, with cute little cloth balls<br/>hanging from small white ropes on the side.<br/>The woman grabbed the phone and dialed a number.<p>*****<p>Across town, in a rather large home for the area, a<br/>phone rang.<br/>"Tendo residence," a woman said, picking up the<br/>phone. "Nabiki speaking."<p>*****<p>"There's nothing but women here, Nabiki," the<br/>green-haired woman said, almost growlling.<p>*****<p>"What was that?" Nabiki asked with a smirk. "I<br/>couldn't hear you."<p>*****<p>"I SAID," the woman on the phone shouted. "There's<br/>NOTHING but WOMEN here!" She glanced around at the<br/>eyes staring at her. "Sorry..."<p>*****<p>"Ranma," Nabiki said with a mock question. "Is that<br/>you?"<p>*****<p>"Of course it's me," Ranma muttered. "Who'd you<br/>think it was, Amaterasu's grand child?"<p>*****<p>"For all we know you could be," Nabiki said. "Oh<br/>don't start Ranma, in the past two years, we've heard<br/>of ancestors of yours that were dragons, vampires,<br/>succubi, demons, angels, gods, aliens, werecreatures<br/>and I think even the snow-woman once. You are quite<br/>possibly the most crossed being on the planet. We've<br/>gotten to the point that we don't know what you are,<br/>so please don't make statements like that again, we<br/>really don't want to invite trouble."<p>*****<p>"Right, right," Ranma said. "But what's goin' on<br/>here, Nabiki. You didn't think I had enough women<br/>trouble so you sent me to a place with no guys?" A<br/>couple of her carefully not listening listeners perked<br/>up on hearing this.<p>*****<p>"Would you rather I sent you to place with ALL guys<br/>the way YOU'RE dressed?" Nabiki asked.<br/>"If you sent him to a place with all guys," Kasumi<br/>said as she passed by. "He'd probably have no problem<br/>at all the way he's dressed." Nabiki covered the<br/>phone and shushed her sister with an amused, if rather<br/>strained, look on her face.<br/>"You are under orders to spend the night relaxing,<br/>Saotome," Nabiki said. "So relax. Talk to some of<br/>the women, go dancing, eat some ice cream, drink some<br/>beer. Blow off some steam before you blow<br/>up...again."<p>*****<p>"Ahh, he had it coming!" Ranma said.<p>*****<p>"Ranma," Nabiki said. "It was a rat, not a wererat,<br/>not a rat demon, not even a jusenkyo cursed martial<br/>artist, just a rat. And you hit it with a chi blast<br/>large enough to dig a new tunnel in that hill."<p>*****<p>Ranma grumbled silently as she pondered that.<br/>"You might have a point," Ranma muttered. "You're<br/>sure, Akane's not going to hear about this? Before I<br/>thought you meant, nobody is going to find out where<br/>you are. Not nobody is going to find out you spent<br/>three days at a club-hotel full of women! Are you<br/>CRAZY sending me here?"<p>*****<p>"Nobody is going to hear about this," Nabiki assured<br/>him. "I set it up after all, and if this gets out my<br/>head's on the platter right next to yours. Though I<br/>could probably talk my way out of any repercussions,<br/>the point is I'd rather not need to, so...no one will<br/>find out."<p>*****<p>"Your concern for my safety is overwhelming," Ranma<br/>muttered.<p>*****<p>"Have you been reading the dictionary Ranma?" Nabiki<br/>asked. "I wasn't aware you knew words like<br/>'overwhelming.'"<p>*****<p>"Ha, ha," Ranma muttered. "So just why is there<br/>nothing but women here?"<p>*****<p>"It's a specialized club. I'm sure someone there can<br/>explain it to you," Nabiki said. Then she continued<br/>in a sing-song voice. "I'm hanging up now Ranma."<p>*****<p>"Wait, Nabiki!" Ranma shouted. "Don't...don't hang<br/>up...you're absolutely sure...That Akane won't hear<br/>about this."<p>*****<p>"Ranma, just forget about Akane for three days,"<br/>Nabiki said soberly. "Just...forget about<br/>her...alright?"<p>*****<p>"But if she..." Ranma started.<p>*****<p>"Forget about her for now," Nabiki said. "That's an<br/>order." She quickly hung up the phone before Ranma<br/>could answer.<p>*****<p>"You couldn't think of anything better than sending<br/>him uninformed into a lesbian dance club?" Kasumi<br/>asked wearily.<br/>"It's also a hotel," Nabiki said smiling.<br/>"Nabiki," Kasumi tsked at her older sister.<br/>"Kasumi," Nabiki said, seriously. "I could have sent<br/>him to the most obscure and tiny tropical island, and<br/>at least one of the lot would have followed him. I<br/>don't think any of them would look for him there."<br/>"The potential consequences," Kasumi said.<br/>"He promised he wouldn't try anything until he saw me<br/>again," Nabiki said. "As for the other, he could<br/>laid. He could run away. He could even fall in love<br/>and never come back here. Hell, with Ranma there's<br/>always the chance he could come back bearing the child<br/>of an alien princess. But I could care less about<br/>that, I want him to forget about Akane. At least<br/>until she acts her age."<br/>"She wasn't herself when that happened, Nabiki,"<br/>Kasumi said.<br/>"It's not the stuff she did while possessed that I'm<br/>angry about," Nabiki said. "It's the fact that she<br/>refuses to admit that any of it was a 'big deal.' She<br/>acts like she doesn't care about what did or could've<br/>happened."<br/>"It's an act," Kasumi started. "She's scared."<br/>"There's more people involved than just her," Nabiki<br/>snapped. "So she can take her act and stuff it.<br/>After Ranma finally gets rid of Happosai's fetish<br/>demon, her first act of free will is to hit Ranma up<br/>side the head and berate the lot of us for not telling<br/>her about her little pet pig being Ryouga. And not<br/>one word on the matter since. Akane is NOT high on my<br/>list of people right now."<br/>Nabiki stalked off, leaving Kasumi behind shaking her<br/>head. She supposed it was lucky that nothing truly<br/>permanent had happened all the physical changes had<br/>been reversed when the demon had been banished, and<br/>Akane hadn't gotten around to doing more than changing<br/>people yet. No worse hentai behavior, but it had been<br/>close.<p>((Notes: Got bored...so, yes, did something stupid and<br/>started another idea...mostly comedic but starting on<br/>a slightly dark note...as for Kiyone...she may be a<br/>highly intelligent tactician, strategist and<br/>investigator, but if something has been bothering for<br/>a long time she has tendency to get hasty, slipshod,<br/>and downright stupid in her attempts to fix it...hence<br/>that "Get Ayeka laid." plan...and the relationship...I<br/>just think it's fun to put Kiyone in such awkward<br/>situations...oh yeah...even if I go with the implied<br/>prediction in Nabiki's rant, most likely this will not<br/>be a Ranma/Ayeka match up beyond a one or two night<br/>stand...I really don't know where I'll end up with<br/>this one...if I follow it at all...as for my<br/>imaginings of Akane as possessed by a fetish<br/>demon...check out .com and go to<br/>Sebestians adult galleries...lots of furry, rubber,<br/>bondage and other strange fetishes...what can I<br/>say...I was running on fumes when I wrote this<br/>idea...))
