Cloud Dreamer</i></p><p>Chapter  four - Stud Training</p><p>Skuld  hesitantly made his way across Asgard. He  watched Thor practicing with his hammer for a while before he gained enough  courage to call out, "Hey Thor, do you have a moment?"</p><p>"Huh, oh, hi little one." Thor grinned  down at the diminutive (by comparison) kami. "What do you need?   Misplace your doll or something?"</p><p>"Thor,  I'm in trouble . . ." That was as far as he got.</p><p>"I'll  tear him apart." Thor roared, "Who has taken your honor from you young maiden?"</p><p>Blushing  brightly, Skuld grabbed onto Thor's arm and yelled to get his attention. "NO,  that's not what I meant."</p><p>"Oh,  well . . . that's good. Right?"</p><p>Skuld  decided to just 'bite-the-bullet', dragging the explanation out just wasn't  going to work he could see. "Thor, I made Dad mad and He changed me into  a guy. But I don't know how to be a boy. You are the manliest man I  know so I thought that maybe you'd help me . . . you know, be a guy."</p><p>Thor  was shocked for a moment before gently chuckling. "That's one heck of a  practical joke. I didn't think the ole Man had it in Him." Thor  didn't get a chance to say anything else as a massive lightning bolt toasted  him.</p><p>Fortunately  lightning was part of the massive kami's domain and  he recovered almost immediately. Hair in wild disarray and clothing  smoking, Thor observed somewhat rhetorically, "I guess it wasn't a joke then."</p><p>Skuld  sighed and decided to try again later.</p><p>Ranko  watched as Skuld explained the mechanics of how a computer worked. She  was a bit loathe to admit it, but she was impressed  with what Skuld was able to do.</p><p>Skuld  smiled, "Here Ranko, let me show you something called  the Web." He grinned as he thought of a way to capture her attention,  "It's a place where you can find information about all sorts of martial arts  and you don't have to worry about being forced to pay for it."</p><p>He  shared a grin with the redhead, "That's why Nabiki was so careful to not let  you know anything about it."</p><p>In  the next couple of hours, Skuld taught Ranko how to use the computer and surf  the net. Ranko was hesitant at first until she happened on an obscure  martial arts technique that she already knew. Suddenly fired up, she  began to treat it as a challenge, her mind seeking ways to glean information  useful to her.</p><p>Skuld  looked at his newly assembled computer and then back at the redhead using it  with obvious enjoyment. Finally coming to a decision he hesitantly asked,  "Ranko, would you like to have this computer for your own?"</p><p>Suddenly  suspicious since nobody ever did anything for her without wanting something in  return, Ranko asked, "Why? What do you want in return? I ain't gonna have your kid, you  know that don't ya? I'm a guy. So bribing me ain't  gonna work."</p><p>Skuld  absently observed to himself that Ranko's language skills apparently  deteriorated whenever she was under pressure. "Yeah, I know that.   It's ok too. I really would like to become a girl again, but it's not  fair for you to pay that price for somebody else."</p><p>Ranko  was apparently not listening very well; "I ain't gonna marry ya, no matter what you say."</p><p>Skuld  sighed and then decided that it was time to clear up a misunderstanding that  was primarily Urd's fault at the start. "Ranko, you  don't have to 'have' my child. Kami-sama only said that you had to 'name'  my first born child of a mortal mother."</p><p>"But  . . . I thought."</p><p>"Well,  unless you happened to be interested that is," Skuld teased a little.</p><p>"No,  nope, nada, no way . . ." Ranko would have continued if Skuld hadn't placed a  finger over her perfect lips. Still she muttered, "I'm a guy."</p><p>"I  understand," Skuld said as he smiled at her. "No, the only reason I brought  up the computer bit was that I was just wondering if you wanted to have a  computer at home to use. I already have a couple of them and I thought it  would be nice to be able to exchange e-mail with you as well as paying you  something for teaching me some martial arts."</p><p>Ranko  felt a slight warm glow in her chest at these words and hesitantly nodded  yes. She didn't try to speak, as she was very confused in a happy sort of  way that made no sense to her at all.</p><p>The  two of them boxed up the computer and quickly transported it to Ranko's  room. As they set it up, Nodoka peeked in at the young couple. She  said nothing, but she inwardly smiled as she watched her child's horizon's  expand further.</p><p>Thor  was enjoying teaching the younger kami all the end's &amp; clouts of being a  guy, at least from his perspective that is. "Alright, Skuld, let's see  you twirl that mallet of yours again. After all, 'real men' use war  hammers in battle."</p><p>"But  . . . bu"</p><p>"Humm, I see what you mean. Your mallet is a bit  lightweight to get much distance with it and still do much damage."   Thor's massive brow beetled in thought a moment. "Here, try my hammer and  see what you think. If you like it maybe we can modify your mallet to be  like it somewhat."</p><p>Thor  handed his massive hammer to Skuld who strained to pick it up.</p><p>Thor  grinned and imparted some of his energy into the hammer with a deft twist.</p><p>Skuld  and the hammer began to twirl. Thor scratched his head a bit puzzled as  he wasn't sure if Skuld was twirling the hammer or if it was the other way  around and around and . . .</p><p>The  kami of thunder shrugged his massive shoulders and sent a stronger surge of  power to the hammer. The huge war hammer began to glow and lightning  coursed its path about the struggling Skuld for a few tense moments before the  hammer soared off into a thunderous strike against the mountain face that Thor  used for his target practice.</p><p>"Good  toss young one." Thor glanced about for Skuld. "Young  one? Skuld? Where did that scamp  go?"</p><p>Thor  summoned a lightning bolt and rode it to the cracked granite mountain  flank. He reached for the handle of his massive hammer only to stop when  he heard a pitiful sound.</p><p>"Owie."</p><p>Thor  carefully pulled the hammer from the indentation that it had made in the  mountain and looked into the hole. A large sweatdrop  rolled down the back of his head as he looked at Skuld imbedded into the  mountain with the imprint of a war hammer running the entire length of his  body.</p><p>"Humm, maybe a war hammer isn't the right tool for you after  all," he said. Thor looked about himself, he could have sworn that he  heard Odin laughing somewhere in the distance.</p><p>Ukyo  was a little bit surprised when she heard the full (modified) story about what  happened to change Ranma into Ranko; they withheld the fact that Skuld was the  goddess who had locked Ranma and they said nothing about Skuld's gender  dilemma. She was somewhat appeased when both Skuld and Ranko affirmed  that they had absolutely no intention of ever becoming an item, not that she  really thought her Ranchan swung that way in any  case. On the other hand, it pretty well ended her chances with Ranma  after Skuld said that it probably be years before a 'cure' could be  found. Ranko's feminine appearance was very disconcerting to her  though. She admired the new identification wistfully wondering if maybe  her legal gender could be changed back to girl.</p><p>Ranko  grinned, "Let me ask mom about it. Give me the details and I'll see if  she can help my best friend."</p><p>Ukyo  sighed, 'there it was again; 'best friend'. She was really beginning to  believe that Ranma, no, Ranko really was serious about just being best friends.'   A whimsical smile played across her lips as she considered the problem.   She really didn't want revenge on Ranma or Ranko anymore, but a little payback  would be nice. She grinned, "Ranko, I've got a better idea. Since  I'm legally a guy and now you are legally a girl, whatta  ya say that we tie the knot?"</p><p>Skuld  and Ukyo blinked as Ranko seemingly vanished, the slamming of the door telling  them that she had really left at 'light-speed'.</p><p>Before  Skuld could say a word, the momentary silence was broken by Ukyo's  giggles. "Gotcha Ranma!" she crowed.</p><p>Skuld  thought about it a moment then chuckled too. Seeing the questioning expression  on the chef's face, he continued, "So I guess that you were just getting back  at Ranko for stringing you along. Do you want me to let her know that or  do you want to 'develop' this situation a little longer?"</p><p>Ukyo  wiped the tears from her face and softly replied, "Just let it be for  now. Ranma, I mean Ranko and I will work it out. In some ways I'm  serious, but I couldn't really do that to my best friend. Besides, I'm  into guys, not gals.</p><p>After  leaving Ukyo, Skuld quickly found Ranko and soon the two were walking along  together talking about their recent experiences. First at Ukyo's, but the  conversation quickly turned to something that was bothering Ranko on the  internet. Ranko was blushing both with anger and embarrassment as she  described a recently found web-site that specialized in semi-nude photos of herself.</p><p>"What!"  Skuld fumed. "Tell me their address and I'll see about creating a virus  that not only will wipe out the site, the server it's on, but will poison  everybody who visits it."</p><p>A  week ago, Skuld's threat wouldn't have meant anything to the neo girl; but now,  all she could say was, "Re . . . really! You'd do that for me?   Thank you."</p><p>"RANMA!"</p><p>The  young couple stopped and after a quick glance at each other, rapidly scanned  the area for . . . oh, Akane.</p><p>The  angry girl stormed up to Ranko and hissed, "It's only been just over a week and  already you have another bimbo. Did you tell her your dirty little  secret?"</p><p>Skuld  chuckled (as opposed to giggled, he really was working on the guy stuff).   "Actually, I'm a guy. But don't get me wrong, I think his guy side is  just as cute as her girl side is."</p><p>Akane  lost it then. But just before she could swing the chi mallet she had  projected, Skuld nailed her with a carefully judged mallet strike of his own  that was delivered like an uppercut. Akane vanished into the atmosphere to  appear in the Tendou koi pond a few moments later.</p><p>Akane  sat in the pond sputtering with anger and frustration. It seems that  every time she decided to approach Ranma and apologize, Ranma would do  something perverted and set her off again.</p><p>Soun  sat on the porch and wailed . . . the Tendou patriarch waterworks was in full  operation.</p><p>She  hissed in seething anger. "This is ALL your fault you  two lazy old farts!" Akane then pointed an accusing finger at her father,  "If you had at least acted like a father and a man, your daughters wouldn't  have to cover your ass and we wouldn't be in this situation."</p><p>She  glared at the elder Saotome, "I'm beginning to understand why you've been able  to stay away from your wife for a decade. Maybe your interests lie along  the same path as that of your worthless son." Matching their angry glares  with a blazing one of her own, she clarified, "I saw Ranma walking along with a  guy; a guy that likes both his girl side AND his boy side."</p><p>Passing  the two frozen men, she stormed into the house, carefully avoiding the  destroyed kitchen and made her way upstairs to her room where she had some  snacks hidden.</p><p>Kasumi  quietly came home from spending her day with Belldandy and some of her other  friends and amusedly watched the two fathers build a campfire in the yard and  prepare a meal for themselves.</p><p>Gathering  her courage, Kasumi spoke, "Father, as Akane has taken over the household as  part of her bridal training since she's the one designated to inherit it, I've  decided it was time for me to start to get my own life together. I've  enrolled in the local community college. Beginning Monday, I start  classes."</p><p>Both  fathers whimpered.</p><p>Over  the next several weeks, Ranko studied hard with her mother's encouragement and  help. Several days before school started, Ranko was reconsidering having  to repeat several years of school. "Mom," she asked. "Do I gotta start school all over?"</p><p>"Yes  dear, you gotta." She snickered, "at least  until you learn to speak somewhat more civilized at the very least."</p><p>Ranko  nodded, "Well, ok, I guess it really doesn't matter. Besides, it will  make it easier in school this way since I already took these classes."</p><p>"Really?"  asked her mother. "That would be true only if you learned it the first time  through."</p><p>Ranko  sighed and picked up her books again after she finished breakfast.</p><p>Setsuna  grimaced as she read the dossier on the new student. 'So this was the  source of all their problems, Ranko Saotome, age 16. Drat! That  means she'll be in the same class as the inners. Oh, whoopee. Wait  a moment, I thought her name was Ranma, oh, that's her elder brother, ok.   How odd, they have the same birthdays. Hummm,  there's a note in her file about how she sometime 'subs' for her brother.   Ah, so that is where the name confusion comes from.'</p><p>Her  brow creased in surprise, 'pretty good scores. She's a lot smarter than  her brother it seems.' She looked over at the other Saotome folder on her  desk that had a note on it that said, '<i>withdrawn from school for training  trip</i>'. 'I wonder why the time gate only shows her now and only her  brother in the past since that disaster with Skuld?   Hummm,  must be the influence of the kami or maybe it's because that's why and when  Skuld lost her powers because of her.'</p><p>Setsuna  decided that she'd have to give the four inner scouts that also attended the  school some advance warning and information about the girl. It wouldn't  do for them to be either unaware of or alienated from someone so important to  their uncertain future.</p><p>Nabiki  came home briefly one weekend. She didn't stay the night.</p><p>Akane  struggled with the laundry. She snickered to herself in embarrassment as  she pulled out her pink (formerly white) blouses. Genma stared at his  pink gi.</p><p>Kasumi  just smiled as she did her own laundry.</p><p>Soun  hesitantly started to clean up the kitchen. Mostly they just tossed out  the pans and bowls instead of trying to clean them. Genma used a hammer  and chisel to clean several of the counter tops of splatters from Akane's  experiments in exotic cuisine.</p><p>When  dinner time came around, Kasumi left citing a previous engagement with a  friend. Genma resignedly started another campfire.</p><p>Soun  whimpered, he'd tried talking with Kasumi but she'd been rather obstinate in  her decision that reparations from Akane were necessary before she'd make  another meal for the family.</p><p>Akane  just snarled. She was NOT going to admit that she was at fault. On  the other hand, she no longer tried cooking. Not after the third time  she'd tasted her own food.</p><p>Ranko  sighed as she waited to be introduced to the rest of the class. It was  the start of the second half of the school year and she wasn't all that  thrilled to be returning to school; especially not as a sophomore instead of a  senior. On the positive side, she had managed to score exceptionally high  on the tests. On the negative side, her mother had used that as a basis  to enroll her into a pre-medical study group. 'Oh, joy. What was it  with mother's wanting their kids to be doctor's anyway?'</p><p>The  day had gone fairly well. She had actually managed to stay awake in class  and learn. It was amazing what having a good night's sleep and not having  to fight virtually non-stop did for one's ability to stay awake and  concentrate.</p><p>She  had met some very friendly girls who almost seemed to already know something  about her. That made her a bit suspicious, but she reserved her judgment  for the moment. Ranko was hoping that Ami, Usagi, Minako and Makato would  all turn out to be friends. All four of them had unusually strong auras  that intrigued her. They all sat fairly near to her seat in class.   Each of the four girls was very different yet that actually make their  potential friendship all the more interesting.</p><p>After  school, Ranko trudged off to find where this 'doc-club' was meeting. 'Oh,  joy, whoopee, yea'.</p><p>The  club councilor, who turned out to be Ami's mother, was a practicing  physician. She glanced at the new addition to the club and decided to  talk privately with her later. "Hello kids, I hope you had a good  vacation between semesters, but as I warned you last time, this semester we  will be doing 'hands-on' training instead of classroom study like last  semester. This will be a chance for all of you to put some of your book  skills to practical use. In addition, it will help you to decide if this  sort of work is something that you can enjoy."</p><p>Skuld  decided that if he was going to be a guy for the rest of his life, he might as  well get a bit of social training on how to go about it. He knew just who  to ask for help too.</p><p>"Hey  Thor, can I ask you for a favor?" Skuld blushed brightly but continued, "Tell  me about guys and girls, Ok?"</p><p>Thor  scratched his head, a sound like a logging chain being drug through the  brush. "I don't understand Skuld. Since you used to be a girl, don't  you know all about girls already?"</p><p>Skuld  blushed even brighter, "No, you see I never even thought about stuff like that  before so I . . . well, I mean I never did anything. I mean, I mean . . .  I just don't know any of that stuff because it wasn't ever important to me."</p><p>Thor  nodded in simulated understanding. "Ok, I'll tell you some of the stuff  that I've done and seen and let you chose what you want to try. That work  for you?" Seeing the younger fella nod, the  older kami then said. "Come on. Let's head over to the tavern for a  few mugs of mead. While I talk, the other guys may have some advice to  give also."</p><p>'Lousy miserable weekend,' mumbled Ranko under her breath. Actually it  wasn't the fact that it was a weekend that was bothering the girl. She  was complaining about what was happening this particular weekend.   Weekends in general were great, but this weekend, she shuddered.</p><p>She  opened the fridge and looked for some leftovers. She saw the bowl of 'red  beans and rice' and shuddered again. 'No way was she gonna  'celebrate' that again.' She grabbed an apple and quickly shut the door.</p><p>She  looked at the clock, 'well, Skuld would be over soon. That would distract  her for awhile,' she thought. She was all too aware of her body just now  and craved distraction.</p><p>Belldandy  was beginning to get worried about her younger brother. For nearly a  month he'd come home to the temple on most school nights staggering into the  temple and collapsing into bed and reeking of mead.</p><p>She  asked Urd for help only to blush a bit as Urd revealed that Skuld was receiving  guy training at the local heavenly stud institute, i.e. the Asgard  tavern. "As though any of those idiots know anything," whispered  Belldandy only to blush when she realized that the reason Urd was giggling was  because she'd overheard her and agreed too.</p><p>Oh  well, at least Skuld was keeping his weekends free for Ranko's visits.   Both of the youngsters seemed to enjoy their time together. Belldandy  sighed, 'it was a shame that they couldn't spend more time together.'   Belldandy paused in thought and then placed a call to Nodoka.</p><p>"Hello  Nodoka, this is Belldandy . . ." Ten minutes of feminine pleasantries passed  before Belldandy suggested, "I hear that Ranko is having a little trouble with  her classes. You know, Skuld is very smart and has already completed all  those same studies. He could tutor Ranko and she could also continue to  give Skuld some additional martial arts lessons as well. That would be  good training should Ranko ever decide to pursue a career as a sensei."</p><p>Nodoka  though about it for a moment then, "I'll ask Ranko. It's time my child  started to make those kinds of decisions for herself. I think the idea is  a good one though. Will that do?"</p><p>"Of  course," said Belldandy. "Please have Ranko call if the idea is  acceptable."</p><p>Urd sighed in satisfaction. The legal  wrangle with Nabiki had gone just about as she'd expected. She'd met with  Nabiki and her attorney in a pre-court meeting after the initial court  appearances and displayed the evidence she was prepared to present to the  court.</p><p>While  Nabiki's attorney had appeared shocked, Nabiki was in fact stunned. She'd  not realized just how legally vulnerable she was not to mention that the  picture Urd painted of her was chilling even to her.</p><p>Urd  was not interested in negotiating and Nabiki was scared to fight her in court,  so the settlement had resulted in Ranko receiving the lion's share of the net  profits. Nabiki was able to negotiate a deal whereby she surrendered all  her financial interests in Ranma/Ranko and no longer marketed any images of  him/her. In return, Urd agreed to not make public the information she had  been able to gather.</p><p>Ranko  had talked to Dr. Mizuno and been granted permission to participate in the  club's work-study program based on her years of experience dealing with her own  injuries during her 10 year martial arts journey.</p><p>Ami  grabbed the redhead as her club partner in order to study the other girl a bit  closer. The two of them were assigned to be 'candy-stripers' each  Saturday afternoon at a pediatric rehabilitation ward in the local hospital.</p><p>Ami  and the hospital staff were surprised at the depth of knowledge that Ranko  displayed on how to restore body mobility.</p><p>Ami  grinned at the redhead as she cajoled the 8-year-old boy into attempting to  walk. "I was watching this Dragonball episode the  other day," Ranko started.</p><p>"Really,  what happened?" the boy eagerly asked.</p><p>"I  saw them do this really neat maneuver," she squinted at the lad, "You know, I  think that you could even do it."</p><p>The  boy's face fell. "No . . . not since my dad . . . hurt me." The boy  struggled to hide his tears, his face to the floor.</p><p>"Hey,  your ole man is a saint compared to mine and I can do it," the redhead  challenged.</p><p>"Your  dad hu . . . hurt you too?"</p><p>Ranko  pulled up her skirt on one side noticing that the young boy was much less  embarrassed than she was. "Yeah, see the couple of scars here?" She  sighed, "There's more but I'm sort of embarrassed to show them now.   Anyway, let me show you this move. It's neat and I know that it's  something you can do."</p><p>The  boy looked at the pair of faint white scars that arched over the older girl's  knee. He hesitantly held out a small hand and touched them. "That  must have hurt a lot." Seeing her nod, he asked, "You really think I can  do this." At her smile, he grinned just a tiny bit, "Ok, I'll try if  you'll help me."</p><p>"No  problem kid. Now first you have to stretch out the muscles like this,  really slow and careful. Don't worry, I gotcha." Ranko added.</p><p>Skuld  spent the time just after school tutoring Ranko. Afterwards the pair of  them worked out together in the very large new dojo that Ranko had had built  next door to her mother's house. Skuld had suggested that perhaps he  could be Ranko's financial advisor and agent. The brilliance of Ranko's  answering grin rivaled Akane's best.</p><p>Ranko  was inordinately pleased with the progress that Skuld was making. On the  other hand, Skuld was actually remembering when (s)he'd  once learned this before when it was the 'wave-of-the-future' several centuries  ago or so.</p><p>The  pair spent every weekend together besides the near daily after school  tutoring. Ranko was still on the watch for Mara and Skuld felt guilty for  forcing Ranko to be a girl. Both were also helping the other to cope with  being the 'wrong' gender. Sometimes it got sort of funny.</p><p>Nodoka  has having a hard time suppressing her giggles as she watched the two youths  attempt to teach the other 'how-to-walk-right' as they termed it.</p><p>"No  Ranko, don't stride like that! Take shorter  steps and keep your feet closer to the centerline of your travel." Seeing  the blank look, Skuld attempted to exaggeratedly demonstrate what he meant only  to have Ranko fall over giggling uncontrollably.</p><p>Still  giggling, Ranko stood up and attempted to mockingly repeat what Skuld had done  only to have the unusual stimulation of her rear gracefully swaying as her body  moved slightly in counterpoint as well. It was very frustrating to her for him  to be so blatantly right; especially when her mom praised her for walking so  femininely.</p><p>Ranko  was a bit more direct in her countering lesson. She grabbed Skuld's hips  from behind and held them in place as she forced him into a 'manly'  stride. In fact she ran him several miles before she was 'satisfied' with  the lesson. She wasn't exactly sure what the lesson was but his body  trembling with fatigue and sweat seemed to work for her.</p><p>Skuld  had released his hold on his age lock and even allowed it to accelerate to about  thrice the mortal rate. At this rate, in a year his apparent age would  match Ranko's.</p><p>Ami  and Ranko were just finishing up their 'shift' at the hospital one Saturday  afternoon when a diamon suddenly appeared outside the  building. Ranko was stunned to notice that the weird creature seemed to  look a little bit like an animated sub-compact car. But when it crushed  the outer wall of the hospital grounds and advanced toward the children's wing,  she lost all hesitation about confronting it.</p><p>"Ranko"  Ami called to her, "Let's get out of sight. Let the Sailor Scouts handle  it." Ami was going to add more but Ranko was already gone. Dashing  behind the shadowed edge of another building with her communicator in one hand  pressing the emergency call button, Ami raised her transformation pen in her  other hand in preparation for changing when the sight before her caused her to  stop in stunned surprise.</p><p>Ranko  was pissed; totally, royally and thoroughly. She attacked without fanfare  or insults. No testing or kid gloves, she went for the kill from the  first strike. She hit the arm that threatened the hospital with a moko takabisha blowing it off at  the apparent elbow. As the creature screamed with its blaring horn, she  darted at full speed between it's legs and hit both  knees with the Amazon 'breaking point' attack as she passed. Both knees  exploded in shrapnel that she left behind so fast was  her attack. She rebounded off the building wall and her glowing fists  suddenly shimmered with a huge glowing mallet that she swung with all of her  incredible strength. The blow was so fast that the mallet head became  supersonic and the sonic blast blew out the windows of the hospital on that  side even as the remains of the diamon simply  vanished in the resulting explosion that left a fuming but slightly panting  redhead standing in a deep crater where a construct of evil had once stood.</p><p>"Holy  shit!" murmured Ami into her communicator. The shy girl was subjected to  rather intense teasing by her teammates when they met for a Sailor Scout  meeting later that evening. The teasing did not last past the explanation  of what she'd seen.</p><p>Kasumi  and Belldandy were sitting and talking, having a very pleasant visit when they  were startled by Urd's shout, "YES, way to go girl."</p><p>Urd  appeared, almost trotting as she rushed to the TV, turned it on and inserted a  tape into the player. "You just have to watch this. It happened  only a few minutes ago and it's awesome."</p><p>It  was, especially the appended slow motion 'replay' that Urd had thoughtfully  prepared. "Oh, my!" Was the other two girls'  response, in stereo.</p><p>Kasumi  hesitantly said, "That was Ranko, but what was she fighting and when did she  get so powerful?"</p><p>Urd  grinned and replied proudly; "The monster was a leftover from those that the  Sailor Scouts used to fight. As for power, Ranko is a lot more powerful  than even that. It's pretty obvious that she wanted to end the fight in a  hurry so that no one in the hospital would be harmed." She snickered,  "Looks like she should have pulled that last blow with her war hammer a bit  though. The breaking glass caused by the sonic boom didn't hurt anybody  but it could have."</p><p>"Oh,  my," whispered Kasumi. As Urd started to remove the tape, Kasumi asked,  "Urd, may I have a copy of that, please?"</p><p>Nabiki  had come home for the weekend again and Ryouga had shown up also. After  the rest of the family had eaten the camp meal prepared by Ryouga for the  family, Kasumi (who had eaten with Belldandy) slipped the tape into the player.</p><p>Responses  were just about as expected.</p><p>Ryouga  rose to his feet and shouted out enraged, "how dare he learn MY  technique. That dishonorable cur will die when we next meet." A  sudden visage of Urd caused him to blanch and then sit down again.</p><p>Akane  frowned and snarled, "I can't believe that jerk has stolen my technique."   She sniffed disdainfully, "and she didn't even have a very good follow through  either."</p><p>Genma  huffed, "I don't know who that was. That girly girl is no relation to  me."</p><p>Nabiki's  eyes nearly popped out, "You . . . you mean that's normal for Ranma?"</p><p>A  quiet chuckle brought everybody's attention to Kasumi. "Her IDENITY card  says she is RANKO Saotome, age 16, DAUGHTER of Genma and Nodoka Saotome.   She's using a standard GIRL's mallet attack just like  Akane does and an AMAZON technique that I believe Ryouga also knows. She  was there to defend the children's wing of a hospital and YOU weren't."   Everybody caught the significance of the words that Kasumi had  emphasized. Ranma had got on with her life and was doing well; very well  without them.</p><p>Kasumi  added as an aside to Nabiki, "Hummm, actually, Ranko  was holding back on her power a lot so that she wouldn't cause any harm to the  kids in the hospital. Apparently she's a lot more powerful than that  even." She sighed and added, "I hope she doesn't get into any trouble for  breaking those windows. It was an accident. I don't think she  anticipated the mallet head's sonic boom."</p><p>"Daughter?" Genma questioned, "I don't have a  daughter. What do you mean? That used to be my good for nothing son  who got himself locked as a worthless girl."</p><p>Kasumi  responded with a quiet grin, "Oh, but I heard it from the head of the Saotome  clan, one Nodoka Saotome I believe, that she'd adopted Ranko as her daughter  since you had declared that Ranma was not your son anymore."</p><p>"Nodoka?" Genma thought about repercussions  possibly involving a katana and decided that visiting his home was not a desirable  thing to do any time soon.</p><p>"Why  age 16?" asked Nabiki.</p><p>"I  think it was to give Ranko a chance to do better in school, besides with her  having the same birth date as Ranma, only two years younger, it created an  explanation for the confusion between them." Kasumi added, "Sometimes  that's all somebody needs in order to be able to ignore the actual magic in  Ranma life. Beside," she added, "that is Ranko's apparent mental and  physical age anyway, so it works out pretty well."</p><p>Ryouga  asked, "Why was she at the hospital anyway? I don't think that it's near  her school or home or even a mall."</p><p>Nabiki  gave him a weird look, "You're right, but how would you know that given your  sense of direction and spatial relationships?"</p><p>Ryouga  just glowered a bit in response.</p><p>Kasumi  grinned; she had discovered that she just loved doing this. "It turns out  that Ranko is in a premed school club; she's sometimes a 'candy-striper' there  in the hospital's children's wing. Apparently she's pretty good.   I've heard rumors (from Nodoka only) that she may give up martial arts and  study medicine instead."</p><p>Soun  and Genma both blanched and quickly huddled to confer about what they could do  about this latest development without seeming to take Ranma back just yet.</p><p>Ami  had just finished helping Skuld to tutor Ranko at the redhead's home and was  watching Ranko teach Skuld some of the basic kata of  her school. She was in awe both of Ranko's martial arts skill and her  teaching abilities. One thing she did notice though was that every once  in awhile Ranko would issue a slighting jib that was obviously aimed at  challenging Skuld to do better. Skuld on the other hand would simply  freeze at that point and wait. Eventually Ranko would apologize and  restate what she was trying to say. Skuld would nod and they would  continue. It was pretty obvious to the casual observer (herself in this  case) that lessons were being taught on both sides.</p><p>When  Ranko was finished teaching and had set Skuld to repeating some of the day's  lessons (kata), Ami took a chance and asked, "Ranko,  I was wondering if I and a few of my girl friends could train with you like  Skuld is doing?"</p><p>Ranko  hesitated. She wasn't really licensed to teach yet but figured that since  Skuld was a kami, a minor problem like that wouldn't matter,  besides she did have a sort of honor debt to the girl turned guy. She  sighed, "I'm sorry Ami, but I don't have a license to actually teach classes,  so" . . . she paused in consternation as Urd flipped a large manila envelop  toward her.</p><p>Urd  snickered to herself, 'having an approved operations plan made this go so much  easier', she thought to herself. It had been quite a while since she had  really enjoyed her work so much.</p><p>Ranko  opened the folder she found inside the envelope. She stared blankly at  the certificate inside until Ami finally took it from her hand and curiously  examined it.</p><p>"Wow,"  exclaimed Ami. "This says that you do have a license to teach.   That's just weird. I mean you are only 16; you must be a prodigy or  something."</p><p>"I'm  the best," absently murmured Ranko.</p><p>"Now  that your license has shown up, will you teach us now?" Ami was about to  mention all the free tutoring that she'd been doing but then changed her mind.</p><p>Ranko  hesitated, and as she did, Skuld absently noted. "Ami and her friends are  a pretty diverse lot. Trying to cope with them might be more than you can  do. On the other hand, it would provide a lot of experience in being a  sensei. Come to think of it, those girls are your friends and they've all  helped you in various ways." He looked over at Ami and added  significantly, "Some more than others."</p><p>Ranko  shrugged her shoulders in reluctant acceptance, "Yeah, I guess it would be ok.  Can you arrange a meeting with all of the ones that are interested and we'll  set up some sort of schedule."</p><p>Ami  nodded. After seeing Ranko fight, she was pretty sure that this was  something the scouts needed to do to supplement their magic powers.</p><p>After  Ami left, Skuld walked over to Ranko and remarked, "Well you have your first  formal class. Now all you have to decide is whether your students are  going to be your friends or your enemies when you are done. In other  words, are you going to teach them in 'your' newly emerging style or your  father's old insulting style."</p><p>Ranko  frowned and snapped, "Yeah, I understand. By the way, you haven't finished up  your assigned kata yet."</p><p>Skuld  grinned slightly and began to work his body again while his sensei  glowered. Skuld was glad that Ranko would be helping the Sailor Scouts as  she knew who they were since she had actually suffered a bit of hero worship  for the pretty warriors before her encounter with Ranma. As a result of  her interest in them, she had made the effort to discover their  identities. Ranko's recounting of her sole meeting with the outer scouts  had shocked the young kami and forced him to reevaluate the consequences of  Crystal Tokyo.</p><p>Soun  was in a panic. Nabiki had refused to pay for the upkeep of the home and  dojo and they were running out of instant ramen. Genma had suggested  pawning a few things but Akane had overheard him and promptly pounded him for  attempting to 'steal' her inheritance.</p><p>He  sighed, "Genma, old friend, I'm afraid that it's time for the unthinkable."</p><p>Genma  shuddered. "You don't mean . . . get a . . . get a job do you?"</p><p>Soun  nodded. "It's either that or start additional  classes in the dojo."</p><p>Akane  paused, "daddy, I like that last idea. If the two of you team taught,  then I could not only learn from you but I could help with some of the classes  as well and get some experience teaching." She paused and then blushed  and quietly muttered just loud enough for them to hear, "I can't do housework  or cook, so I better concentrate on the martial arts if I want to carry on the  school."</p><p>Kasumi  had been quietly listening and now quietly asked, "Akane. That's father's  idea. What are your dreams? I know you once had dreams of the  theater."</p><p>Soun  frowned at his eldest who just ignored him. Akane sighed and then quietly  answered, "Maybe once I did. But like a schoolgirl crush, it was  something I grew out of. Father's dream of continuing the dojo and school  is also my dream as well now." She grinned, "Come on, Ranma has shown us  that the Art is also a type of theater." She began chuckling and added,  "In actually, it's a too real form of virtual reality or perhaps it's a weird  form of some type of performance arts."</p><p>Soun  and Genma shouted with joy and slapped each other on the backs. Kasumi  just smiled proudly at her youngest sister. Akane knelt before Kasumi,  "Kasumi, I'm sorry for breaking my promises. What do I need to do for  repatriations?"</p><p>Kasumi  firmly replied, "When the house, yard and dojo are in the same condition as  before you broke your promise to me, then I will resume helping. But  understand that I will no longer shoulder the whole load as I did  before." She added, "I have my own dreams to follow now."</p><p>Author's  note: Additional Ranma fan-fiction can be found on my Web Pages.</p><p>C  &amp; C to cloud (underscore) dreamer2000 (at)</p><p>Web-page  - .com  (slash) cloud (underscore) dreamer2000</p><p>And  - .net (slash)</p>
