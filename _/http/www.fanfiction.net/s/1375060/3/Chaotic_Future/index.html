</div><p><i>A  Ranma crossover fanfic</i></p><p>Started  - 1 February 2003   Completed – 12 June 2003</p><p>Last  revised - 10 May  2004   Reason - typos</p><p><i>Characters  are from Ranma ½, Sailor Moon and Ah, My Goddess. They are used without  permission or profit. This is a form of literary tribute to the original  authors and no copyright infringement is intended.</i></p><p><b><i>Chaotic Future . </i></b><b> . . </b><i> by . . .  Cloud Dreamer</i></p><p>Chapter  three - Little Sister Ranko</p><p>Ranma  tried to sleep in, but the soft bed and unfamiliar surroundings of her own  boyhood room denied her that simple pleasure. She rose and put on her  familiar red silk shirt and black pants. She shuddered at the close  feminine fit and nearly gagged on her own cuteness when the bracelet 'prettied'  her up once again when she accidentally rubbed it.</p><p>Nodoka  couldn't help but smile at her cute daughter. If this had still been  'Ranko', she would have considered her bridal training a success at this  point. "Ranma, look at the good side, you don't have to spend a fortune  or a lot of time to look really sharp. Not to mention that if you  need to, you always have a way to instantly clean up. If you have to be a  girl, well the bracelet will really make it easier."</p><p>"Mom,"  tiredly responded Ranma as she morosely studied her delicately applied makeup  in a small mirror. "The damn bracelet takes away the last of my choice  about being a girl. I don't even have a choice about dressing or looking  like a girl anymore. Damn earrings anyway."</p><p>Nodoka  sat beside her child and hugged her. "Sometimes one has to be the reed  before the wind. Resisting like an oak may just break you. I am  proud of my manly son, but I can also accept my beautiful daughter under these  circumstances."</p><p>"These  circumstances?" questioned Ranma.</p><p>"Like  now, where you have no choice in the matter." Her mother softly replied.   "Accepting karma is also a trait of a man. It doesn't mean meekly  accepting what others have forced on you, but it does mean making the best of  what you cannot change."</p><p>Ranma  asked with surprising calmness despite her nearly overwhelming melancholy,  "What am I gonna do with my life, momma? Everything I once had planned is  gone."</p><p>"Everything? What about your friends and . . ."  Nodoka paused when Ranma shook her head sadly.</p><p>"No, momma. I don't really got  any friends. No fiancées either unless the damn panda  has engaged me in my girl form too." Ranma sighed deeply.   "Urd is sorta helping me out, but after hearing about what she did to that  other goddess, I don't know how far I want to trust her. Her fun could  hurt me. The only good thing to come out of this is that I'm no longer  engaged to anybody, including Akane." She leaned into a hug with her mother.   "I actually glad those two old farts kicked me out so that I could live with  you. I've missed you, momma."</p><p>Nodoka  hugged her daughter and silently decided that she'd make sure Ranma was never  forced to return to the Tendou dojo. "Well, the semester break for the high  school here in Juuban will be ending next week. That gives us time to get  you registered, get you your uniforms and some supplies as well. Maybe we  can even get a head start on the schoolwork too. Who knows, maybe you can  make a few friends at your new school without all the other distractions  interfering now." She grinned mischievously at her neo daughter, "Maybe  you will even meet a cute guy."</p><p>"Owie,"  responded Ranma as she rubbed her head from where it had impacted the table a  few moments earlier. "Mother, I don't LIKE guys that  way. I'm a guy inside, no matter what the outside looks like."</p><p>"The  outside looks really cute and pretty," snickered  Nodoka.</p><p>After  a long (suffering) silence, Ranma asked, "Momma, not many of my old school  mates are gonna recognize me dressed like this, but they might. Do you  think it would be ok if I sorta changed my name so that I got a separate girl  identity just in case it makes a difference later?"</p><p>"Ranko?"  suggested Nodoka.</p><p>"Yes  momma, just as long as it's spelt 'wild child' instead of 'orchid girl'.   Do you think you'll have any problems registering me in school?" Ranko  wondered, a hopeful idea in the back of her mind.</p><p>"I'm  not sure, RANKO," her mother hesitated in thought. "With both the gender  and name change, not to mention the radically different appearances of your two  forms, there might be problems transferring your records and registering you."</p><p>"Momma,"  Ranko paused in embarrassment. "My old school grades ain't all that good.   If I'm gonna hafta start over as a girl, could it be a clean start? It  would give me an inced . . . inderce . . . reason to study harder before school  starts again and later too."</p><p>Nodoka  paused in thought at the mechanics involved in the several different ways this  could be handled. "All right Ranko, since I'm still technically head of  the clan because your father still seems to be on his never-ending training  trip, I think that I can adopt you into the family/clan registrar. We may  have to get a little creative explaining where you came from, but I think I and  a few of my government friends can handle that. I'll see what I can do  this afternoon."</p><p>Nodoka  started the next day off by tossing a new identity card onto the breakfast  table before her daughter after she came down from her bath after working out  several hours in the early morning.</p><p>"Ranko  Saotome," read the pleased girl.</p><p>"Yes,"  grinned her mom, "and early next week we need to register you at Juuban High School, get your placement tests  scheduled and maybe pick up some school uniforms for you too."</p><p>"Mom?"  asked Ranko in confusion, "The birthday is almost right, but this says that I'm  two years younger than I really am."</p><p>"Yes  daughter, I decided to select a younger age for several reasons, first, your  girl form actually does look about fifteen or sixteen. Second, since you  want a fresh start, you need to start at the beginning of high school to do  it. Three, an age difference makes the distinction between your two  identities all the more believable especially since we retained the same  birthday to give an excuse for confusion."</p><p>Later  that morning Ranko was taking another break from her training. That or  schoolwork was all she had to occupy her time at the moment. She was  leaning back against the outer wall of the Saotome compound sitting in the  shade and enjoying her cool down after a vigorous workout. Her gi was  sweat stained and her appearance a bit disheveled from her morning exertion.</p><p>Hearing  an angry voice, she looked into the house only to notice Urd trying to dust herself off as she staggered away from the TV. The  elder goddess was a mess. Her clothing was torn and actually smoked a bit  still, while the woman herself was staggering from fatigue.</p><p>"Da  . . . darn that Mara." Urd snarled to herself.   Noticing Ranko studying her, she explained. "Mara is that demoness you met the  night you were first locked in your curse by Skuld. She is always  ambushing us, especially Skuld or I since we are weaker than her and she knows  that Bell is too kindhearted to  really do much damage to her though she could." She sighed, "It's worse now that Skuld has been stripped of all but her  basic powers. She's a sitting duck for Mara outside the temple area."</p><p>Ranko  slowly walked over to Urd and silently handed her a bottle of sake from the  stores they decided to keep on hand for emergencies like this for her after  learning about Urd's power-up mode at the restaurant. Urd gratefully accepted  it and eagerly sucked at it visibly gaining health and energy as the bottle  emptied. "That's da ticket," she slurred before shrugging off the intoxication  effects as she cast a restoration spell on herself.</p><p>Unfortunately  Ranko was still in range of the spell as the golden bracelet absorbed the  excess magic using it to restore its faded powers even more. The affect  on Ranko was immediate as she was suddenly cleaned and beautified in a  moment. Ranko sighed with a 'put-upon' noise as she studied the designer  fashion gi that she now wore complete with daring silk undies. She put  her hand up and found earrings again.</p><p>"Damn  it Urd, quit doing that to me!" she snarled.</p><p>Urd  only chuckled as she insincerely said, "sorry."</p><p>Ranko  quietly asked, "Will you take me to see Skuld?" Seeing the arched  eyebrow, Ranko continued, "I have a duty to her, er him and you to help defend  you both from this Mara creature. I lost the address so I don't even know  where Skuld lives. Besides I guess I do need to talk to him. Maybe  he's not mad at me for 'popping' him one that first night and he'll let his  other sister unlock my curse now."</p><p>Kasumi  cautiously entered the house as the stench from the kitchen had alerted her to  a certain problem even before she'd reached the front gate. She peeked  into the kitchen and her face blanched at the disaster within. Hearing  some moans from within the dining room, she hurried there only to see her  father and 'uncle' looking as if they were in great pain.</p><p>Akane  was sitting at the table, fuming as she snacked on a carton of ice cream.   Kasumi noticed that her sister's plate was still clean.</p><p>"Akane,  what happened here?" wryly asked Kasumi as if she were totally clueless.</p><p>"These  two idiots are making fun of my cooking." She huffed, "They made me so  mad that I couldn't eat anything except ice cream to cool myself down before I  pounded them."</p><p>Kasumi  put a finger to her mouth for a moment apparently in thought, "That's  odd. What did the meal taste like?"</p><p>Akane  brightened up and she hurriedly filled a dish with . . . something.   Kasumi couldn't even guess at what it was originally intended to be.   "Here you go Kasumi, eat up. I made plenty so we could have leftovers  too." At these words, the men groaned once more and then fainted, out of  their misery for the moment.</p><p>"Akane,"  sweetly smiled Kasumi; "I've already eaten. Besides, I asked you what it  tasted like, not that I wanted to taste it for you. After all you did  promise to taste it before you served it."</p><p>Akane  beamed a confident smile, "I didn't need to taste it to know it was  wonderful. Just try it and you'll see."</p><p>Kasumi's  face lost most of its smile. "It doesn't matter how good it tastes Akane,  what matters is that you broke your promise. Who are you going to blame  this time?"</p><p>Akane's  face darkened in anger, "Ranma was supposed to taste it, it's his fault."</p><p>"But  YOU promised that YOU would taste it." She quietly responded. "We  said nothing about Ranma having any part of this promise. You broke your  promise to me."</p><p>Akane  angrily set the ice cream carton on the table and rose, "I've had enough of  this nagging. I'm going to bed."</p><p>"So,"  sighed Kasumi. "You'll leave your mess for me to clean up thus breaking  the second half of your promise?"</p><p>Akane  snarled in anger, the outline of a mallet almost visible in her hands.   "It's not my fault. Besides, cleaning the kitchen is your job. I'm  the heir to our art and you take care of the house. That's the way it's  been. That's the way it is." With that she stormed off to her room  and slammed the door.</p><p>Kasumi  sat there in shock for a few moments; Akane had never talked to her like that  before. She thought to herself, 'Little sister is taking Ranma's absence pretty  hard'. She glanced into the kitchen again, paused in thought and then  despondently made her way to her room after carefully putting the groceries  away first.</p><p>She  slept in the next morning. She ignored the noise when Akane pounded on  her door. Akane broke the lock as she slammed open the door.   "Kasumi, are you alright?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Oh  yes, I'm fine." Kasumi languidly replied. "Since I now don't have  to cook or clean I thought I'd sleep in a bit. Why? Is something  wrong?"</p><p>"Why  don't you have to cook or clean anymore?" asked her perplexed younger sister.</p><p>"You  broke your promise." Kasumi frowned. "I promised that I wouldn't cook or  clean here if you did until reparations were made. Unlike you, I DO keep  my promise."</p><p>"That  isn't fair Kasumi." Akane complained.</p><p>"You  are the one who made the choice, so live with it." Kasumi said.   "Oh, by the way, please close the door on your way out."</p><p>Frustrated,  Akane hesitated then blushed when she realized she was considering violence  against her sweet, kind and oh so stubborn elder sister. Out of options,  she did as her sister asked. She sighed, then  brightened at the thought that 'she'd make breakfast. After all, how hard  could it be?'</p><p>Akane  hesitated at the door of the kitchen. 'Wow, what a mess! Did she  really do this last night?' She entered the kitchen and eventually found  a semi-clean pot. She started to make something. She wasn't sure as  her ideas changed a few times as she worked. She studied the mess,  hesitantly used a spoon to dish up a small helping. She quickly looked in  the dining room hoping to find somebody else up. Finally she tasted  it. She woke up in pain several hours later.</p><p>Akane  struggled to stand, and finally settled on crawling to the bathroom  instead. There she was violently sick. She shakily rose to her feet  and seeing that it was nearly noon, decided that going  to see her friends could wait. She went into the front room in time to  see her eldest sister come down the stairs.</p><p>Kasumi  smiled and waved to Akane as she 'obliviously' made her way into the bathroom  past her youngest sister. She closed the door before Akane could get out  the words she seemed to be struggling with.</p><p>Akane  stared at the door that Kasumi had all but slammed in her face. 'She was  trying to apologize even though she really didn't think it was her fault.   The promise was just so unfair anyway. That's it! It was Kasumi's  fault for making her agree to an unfair promise. She'd explain it to her  after she got out of the bathroom and everything would be all right  again.' Akane smiled to herself as this perfect  solution occurred to her.</p><p>In  the bathroom, Kasumi washed up before taking a short soak in the furo. As  she exited, she gathered up the clothing strewn about the clothes hamper and  started putting them in the hamper. Yesterday she had been involved much  of the day with ensuring that the hole in the dining room floor was properly  repaired so she hadn't had time to really clean as she usually did.</p><p>She  sadly smiled when she saw the Chinese dress that Ranma had been wearing the  final night of the convention. She held it up, inspecting it for any  needed special care. As she did, a napkin fell out of the shallow pocket  of the dress.</p><p>Kasumi  bent down to pick up the piece of paper to put it in the trash when she noticed  that it had writing on it and the writing was glowing. She knelt down to  look at the napkin closer without having to touch it. Nothing changed.   She touched the napkin and felt a sense of peace. She thought about the  omen before her and then decided that she'd visit the address given there;  after all her day was free now.</p><p>Quickly  dressing, she pocketed the napkin and exited the house while Akane was still in  her room trying to find clean clothes for herself.</p><p>Urd  grabbed onto Ranko and started pulling her toward the TV. Ranko  stubbornly planted her feet and halted the taller goddess. "Come on  Ranko. You said you wanted to go to the temple where I live with  Skuld. Why are you stopping?"</p><p>"I  want to walk there, besides you could use the exercise there chunky." Ranko  snickered at the other woman as she froze and then stabbed the teasing girl  with a sharp glance.</p><p>"Humph,"  snorted Urd, "You are just jealous because I'm better proportioned."</p><p>"Naw,"  retorted Ranko with a grin. "I think you are just trying to justify the  fact that I'm bigger than you are."</p><p>"Am not!"</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>"Not  so."</p><p>"Pretty obvious."</p><p>"Prove  it!"</p><p>Glaring  at each other, the two gals sat facing each other, chest to chest, whipped off  their blouses and bras and began a critical comparison. Well they started  to until Nodoka collapsed onto the other couch giggling hysterically.   Seems they hadn't noticed her in the room with them. At which point they  blushed equally brightly and quickly redressed. Ranko whispered,  "Tie?" Urd reluctantly nodded.</p><p>Ranko  blushed again as she really couldn't believe she had just done that.   'Man, I gotta stop being so competitive.'</p><p>Urd  hurried out of the house walking toward their destination. She stopped  when she noticed that Ranko was not with her. Seeing the other girl  stopped behind her, she walked back and asked, "I thought you wanted to go to  the temple together. What's up with walking so far behind me?"</p><p>Ranko  scratched the back of her head nervously, "Well, ya see. It's about this  Mara that's harassing you. I met her already so I don't think she'll  bother ya if I'm with you. So I thought that maybe . . . I should . . ."</p><p>Urd  thought about that for a moment, then asked. "You mean I'm bait?"</p><p>Ranko  nodded hesitantly.</p><p>Urd  didn't like the idea, but thought about it a bit more. She was especially  remembering just how vulnerable Skuld was at the moment. "I don't really  like the idea, but I guess you're right. Just give me some warning if you  can, Ok?"</p><p>Ranko  nodded and with that Urd set off toward the temple, her senses on alert.</p><p>Belldandy  quietly responded to the doorbell summons. Her questioning smile  brightened when she saw Kasumi. Even though they were strangers, they  both sensed kindred spirits. "Hello, may I help you?"</p><p>Kasumi  smiled warmly, "Hello, my name is Tendou Kasumi and I'm not sure why I'm  here. I found this napkin in Ranma's dress. The writing was glowing  and I took that as a sign that I should come here. Do you know anything  about it?"</p><p>Belldandy  looked at the napkin Kasumi was holding out and said, "Oh, that's my sister . .  . er, I mean brother's handwriting. He probably gave it to Ranma.   How is Ranma doing anyway? Skuld is really sorry about locking Ranma in his  cursed form." She paused a moment and then added with a slight amount of  embarrassment, "My name is Belldandy, please call me Bell, Tendou-san."</p><p>Kasumi's  smile faltered a bit as she followed Belldandy into the main room of the  converted temple. "Bell, please call me  Kasumi. As for Ranma, well, things haven't gone too well for her.   After Ranma admitted that she was locked as a female, well everything just sort  of snowballed. It was a series of misunderstandings and people jumping to  conclusions that ended with Ranma being thrown out of the house after my  sisters threatened her; one with financial ruin and the other with death.   It was so unfair and I wanted to talk with her and tell her that I thought she  was still a really neat person."</p><p>"Kasumi?" Belldandy and Kasumi looked at the heap  before the TV where Ranko was holding a barely conscious Urd. "Kasumi, do  you really mean it?"</p><p>"Urd!" Belldandy quickly prepared a healing spell  and revived her elder sister and incidentally 'refurbishing' Ranko yet  again. Not that anybody but her noticed, since most of the attention was  on Urd.</p><p>"Yes  Ranma, I do." Kasumi continued a bit hesitantly. "I wish to  apologize to you for the way my family has treated you. It was neither  fair nor right and I'm ashamed of that."</p><p>Ranko  turned to her traveling companion and asked, "Urd, how ya doing?"</p><p>Urd  shook her head and accepted the sake bottle that Belldandy was holding out to  her and took a big swig. "I'm doing Ok Ranko. But we need to  talk. I didn't realize you were going to try to kill Mara."</p><p>"Oh, my," in stereo at that. None of them  noticed Skuld stop at the edge of the doorway to the room and silently listen  in.</p><p>Kasumi  posed her question first. "Ranma, why is Urd calling you Ranko; why are  you dressing so femininely and why were you going to kill this Mara  person? That seems so unlike you."</p><p>Ranko  shuddered at the memory of the recent fight between her and Mara. It was  tough and Ranko had been losing big time until she utilized the Saotome sealed  techniques. Seems that while demons had some sort of  natural protection against normal martial arts and weapons because of their  abnormally tough hide; they had almost no protection against ki attacks like a  vacuum blade. Ranko had come close to eviscerating the demoness  before she had finally fled limping from the mortal plane with a half severed  leg and holding her stomach with both hands.</p><p>Ranko  softly replied, "Since I'm locked in girl form for the foreseeable future, I  asked my mom if I could be Ranko so that my guy reputation didn't get all  messed up at my new school. Mom agreed and even got me a new identity  card." Ranko tossed her new card on the table and Kasumi picked it up and  immediately noticed the revised birth date.</p><p>Ranko  explained, "Right now I'm listed on the family register as my own sister."</p><p>"And  Mara?" prompted Belldandy.</p><p>Ranko  hung her head a bit and started, "Well, I told Urd that I'd help her against  the demoness named Mara that has been harassing her and Skuld. It's my  duty to help as a martial artist and also since I'm at least partially  responsible for Skuld being weaker now."</p><p>Ranko  looked at Urd and apologized, "Urd, I'm sorry I didn't protect you  better. She got those couple of good shots in at you before I got really  serious. I'll try and finish her off next time so that you and Skuld will  be safe."</p><p>"Darn,"  Softly whispered Urd. Seeing the puzzled expression on Ranko's face she  explained. "Ranko, Mara is a demoness but she's also my half  sister. I know she's evil but it . . . it bothers me to think about her  dying."</p><p>"Oh,  my," said Belldandy. "And there is the doublet system to consider as  well. I know the demons don't care all that much about the consequences,  but we kami have to consider them."</p><p>"Doublet  system?" wondered Kasumi.</p><p>"Yes,"  responded Belldandy, "All demons and kami are linked in pairs. Only  Kami-sama knows the identities of each pair, but the pairing ensures that each  time a kami or demon is slain then the paired demon or kami also dies.   Its purpose is to stop the killing of either kami or demons by the other."</p><p>Ranko  blinked, "Then if I kill Mara, I also kill a kami. DAMN, that means each  time I took out a demon, I slew a kami as well. Damn, damn!"</p><p>"No  Ranma, I mean Ranko. You didn't!" Urd hugged the cursing girl to her.   "The double system only applies to demons or kami killed among  themselves. The rule doesn't apply to deaths caused by a mortal.   Not many kami know about that since it's almost impossible for a mortal to kill  a kami, but I looked it up after you killed Saffron."</p><p>Ranko  sighed in relief, she studied Urd and realized the turmoil of the older  goddess. Finally Ranko said, "Alright Urd, I won't try to kill Mara, just  hurt her a lot. But all bets are off if killing her is the only way to  stop her from killing an innocent."</p><p>Urd  softly said, "Thank you Ranko."</p><p>Skuld  tentatively entered the room. But before he could say anything, Kasumi  asked, "Ran . . . ko, why is your birth date two years later on this identity  card than your real one."</p><p>"Oh,  that." Ranma pointed with her thumb over her shoulder at Skuld, "Well,  since the flat-chested un-cute tomboy locked my curse for the foreseeable  future, I decided that I might as well make the best of it and try to get a new  start on my life. Mom decided that meant redoing the school stuff that I  messed up too. So she changed the listed age of my cursed form to give  the illusion that I'm my own younger sister. It actually makes sense  since I also look about that old in this form."</p><p>"Ranko,  that wasn't a very nice thing to say about a goddess," reproved Kasumi with a  questioning glance at the sniggering Urd.</p><p>"God." Seeing the questioning look in Kasumi's eyes,  Urd clarified; "Skuld was transformed into a boy by Dad after she almost killed  Ranma for mouthing off." She sighed theatrically, "Seems nothing, even  almost dying can get this redhead to quit chewing her toes."</p><p>Ranko  blushed. She looked over at Skuld, then hesitantly said, "Skuld, I . . .  I'm sorry for all that stuff I said to you. Urd is right, I do let my  teasing get away from me. I guess it's the only way I know to interact  with others. I'm not really very good at making friends it seems.   That's probably why I don't got any." Ranko  swallowed and continued, "You really don't deserve to be cursed like me . . ."</p><p>Ranko  stopped talking as Skuld had placed his hand over her mouth. "Apology  accepted. And you don't owe me an apology for me being a guy now. I  did that all on my own when I lost my temper, I'm just sorry that you got  pulled into my punishment. Maybe that was Dad's way of punishing you for your teasing, but on top of everything else you've had to  endure, well, I don't think it was really fair."</p><p>Ranko  looked hopeful, "Then you'll let Belldandy unlock my curse?"</p><p>Skuld  shook his head, "No."</p><p>Ranko  looked annoyed, "Ok, whata I gotta do for ya? What  da'ya want to change ya mind?"</p><p>Skuld  softly said, "Nothing. I just can't undo your curse now and I can't tell  you why."</p><p>"Yes,  you can and you should tell." Everyone looked to Urd as she said these words  with a quiet authority that was unusual for her. "What you should have  realized from looking over the file of Ranma's life is that almost every major  decision in his life as been made by somebody else without once consulting or  even telling him why or giving him a chance to have any control over his  life. He's earned that right and it's a courtesy that you do owe him . .  . her."</p><p>Belldandy  thought about if for a moment before catching Skuld's eye and nodding her  agreement with Urd.</p><p>Skuld  took a deep breath and began. "If I let you change back to boy, a really  cute boy at that; you'll end up married to Akane Tendou by the end of the year  and murdered by her before the end of another year." Seeing the look of  disbelief he added, "I am the goddess, er . . . god of the future. This  is part of my powers and it is something that WILL happen. Even though  you know about it now, somehow you will be manipulated, most likely by using your  honor against you, into marrying her. And she WILL KILL YOU! This  isn't theory, it's been recorded as future  'fact'. Ranma, I mean Ranko, my honor won't allow me to let you  die. I will be the cause of your death if I have the means to stop it and  fail to do so. I'm sorry; I won't let you die. You will have to  stay as a girl until that danger is past. Once I'm sure that the future  has changed and you are safe from that particular danger, then I promise that  I'll allow you to be unlocked, even if you decide to never help me return to my  girl form; I promise." Skuld had taken the redhead's face in his hands  and looked her in the eyes as he made this promise.</p><p>The  mortals were surprised when a clear bell like tone seemed to echo faintly from  everywhere at once. Urd explained, "A kami cannot lie and when one of us  makes a binding promise, it becomes a part of reality itself. It is now  impossible for Skuld to not keep that promise because the very universe itself  will force it to happen."</p><p>"How  long?" asked Ranko despondently as she accepted the necessity of being locked.</p><p>"No  idea at this point. Reality is still readjusting itself to what Kami-sama  did a couple of days ago. The future is still  sort of fragmented." Skuld gestured to his two sisters, "The three of us  took a quick look at the future early this morning and it's still a mess.   A change like that involving someone as important as you just causes chaos to  the future. It could be only a few months, but it might be years. I  just don't know right now, sorry."</p><p>"I'm  important?" softly questioned the redhead.</p><p>"Yes  Ranko," softly said Belldandy, "A warrior like you only happens once every  thousand years or so. Nobody knows what your destiny is, certainly not  even you; but be assured that you do have one if you survive long enough."</p><p>Kasumi  hesitantly asked, "Are you sure about my sister Akane and Ranma? I know  she has a temper, but killing someone just seems so unlike her. Despite  her anger she really is a sweet girl."</p><p>Belldandy  placed a comforting hand on Kasumi's arm, "Yes, we're sure. She doesn't  do it on purpose, but her jealousy causes her to lose control. Part of  the blame is Ranko's since she helped teach Akane that venting her anger  physically had no repercussions."</p><p>"And  Akane . . .?" hesitantly asked Kasumi.</p><p>Urd  spoke softly, "She goes insane with guilt and grief. She never recovers."</p><p>The  five were silent a moment before Ranko concluded with a sad heartfelt sigh;  "Then I guess I'm Ranko for awhile. I suppose that I could live with it  alright if only I could get rid of this annoying bracelet." The  explanation left the others in near tears from giggling. A demonstration  replaced the earrings that Ranko had removed twice already. 'Damn  earrings anyway' thought Ranko.</p><p>Urd  sat down at her terminal. She hesitantly typed in a query:</p><p>'Demoness  first class Mara, request health status.'</p><p>The  system's response was immediate: <i>Authorization</i>?</p><p>Urd  sat and contemplated the question for a moment before hesitantly responding:</p><p>'Sister'</p><p>The  terminal paused a moment, an occurrence that was very unusual for this system,  then:</p><p>Authorization  accepted. Demoness first class Mara gravely injured but will survive.  Recuperation expected to take a minimum of six months since injuries delivered  by mortal Ranma Saotome will not readily heal for demons because of his chaotic  nature. Query reported to subject. Subject asks 'why do you care?'</p><p>Urd  thought of all the hurtful or wiseacre responses she could make and then typed:</p><p><i>'Because  I am a kami and you are my sister. I don't like what you do but I do care  for you – Urd</i>.'</p><p>Urd  then quickly logged out before she had to think anymore.</p><p>She  decided not to tell Ranko that Mara was unlikely to show up for awhile.   Perhaps Skuld could get to know the redhead if Ranko still thought she had to  show up as a bodyguard.</p><p>Skuld  watched Ranko as she gracefully executed a series of kata. Ranko was not pushing  herself, she was just refreshing her muscle memory of some of the little used  knowledge that she had gathered over the years of her wandering training.</p><p>Moving  to a somewhat secluded part of the temple grounds, Skuld hesitantly tried to  repeat some of the moves he'd just seen. Being blessed with an eidetic  memory enabled him to faltering work through them gradually. He didn't  notice Ranko slip up unobserved and watch him for a while.</p><p>"Not  bad," smirked Ranko; "for a wimp anyway."</p><p>Skuld  flushed with a mixture of embarrassment, irritation and surprise. He was  about to make an angry retort when a momentary vision of a broken Ranma gasping  for life surfaced in his memory. Shuddering, he said instead.   "Thank you. Would you be willing to help me get better?"</p><p>Nonplused  by the unexpected response to her taunt, Ranko paused for a few moments, then responded, "Depends on how serious you are. If  all ya want is a bit of toning up, then nah. If  ya really want to learn the art, then I'll think about it after we talk some  first."</p><p>"Sounds  fair," replied Skuld. He thought about all the things he'd learned about  Ranko. He walked over to the redhead and asked, "Hi, my name is Skuld,  I'm the god of the future. Do you want to be friends?"</p><p>Ranko's  eyebrow's knitted themselves and she suspiciously  asked, "What do ya mean. Ya know that I'm NOT gonna have ya kid, right?"</p><p>Skuld  shrugged, "That's my problem, not yours. I'm not asking anything of you  but the chance to be your friend." He hung his head a little and added,  "I don't have very many and I know you have even fewer. I thought that it  would be nice to have another friend, especially if you decide to teach me some  of the martial arts."</p><p>Ranko  slowly nodded and smirked, "Ok, but that don't mean I'm going to go easy on ya,  puny."</p><p>"Ranko."</p><p>"Yeah, Skuld?"</p><p>Skuld wanted to scream, pound and bomb Ranma;  but the memories of the 'bonding' effects forced her into an unusual  somberness. "Friends don't insult friends." He added quietly, "I know that  one of your fighting techniques is insulting your opponents until their rage  overtakes their judgment, but we aren't fighting. Insults just don't help  friendships grow. Thanks to Urd, I KNOW all the details of your life so  that I know that you've experienced this perhaps without realizing why it  happens that way. I'm guessing that you've never stopped to really think  about it before or maybe you just don't know any better since that's how your  father taught you. Please don't insult me. I want to be your  friend, not your enemy. I think you already have enough of those."</p><p>Ranko  was stunned into immobility and watched wordlessly as Skuld turned about and  walked rapidly into the temple.</p><p>The  following day, Ranko and Nodoka were sorting the clothes that Ranko had asked  her mother to get for her from the second hand store. They both figured  that the 'annoying' bracelet would fix them up anyhow so why waste any money on  good clothes that would only be ruined (from Ranko's point of view anyway).</p><p>Ranko  was pondering Skuld's words and working the concept back through her  relationships with others in the past. She had watched her mother closely  all morning as she interacted with everyone else while they had been shopping  together. She needed a few questions answered.</p><p>"Mom,"  hesitantly asked Ranko. "Words are pretty powerful ain't they?"</p><p>Nodoka  nodded, "Yes Ranko. That is the source of the saying 'the pen is mightier  than the sword.' While it is referring to the written word, the concept also  applies to the spoken word. While your actions have something to do with  making friends and enemies, your words are really the deciding factor."   She paused then added, "Not only the mere words themselves,  but also the context, when you say them, whether they are true and even how you  say them; all of these are part of the way other people perceive what a person  is saying to them. It's also part of the reason why it's important for you  to learn to speak properly. It's a valuable tool that you can get the  best effect out of only if you use it not only precisely but correctly as  well."</p><p>'Sigh,'  Ranko picked up a pair of tattered shorts and a stained tank top. "It  sounds both really simple and horribly complex at the same time."</p><p>Her  mother praised her, "Well said Ranko. That is an example of the power of  words. That's why Nabiki was able to dominate so many others despite not  being a warrior."</p><p>"Oh . . . OH!"</p><p>"Hey  Skuld, what cha doing?" asked Ranko as she settled next to the young god.</p><p>Skuld  smiled at the girl and then replied, "I'm putting a computer together out of  spare parts just to see what I can do with them. Do you have a computer?"</p><p>"Me?  Nah, I've never used one of them things." She paused a moment and then  continued, "Some of my buddies were trying to get me to play some games on  their computers, but it seemed awful boring compared to the real stuff so I  passed on it."</p><p>"Yeah,  I know what you mean," sighed Skuld. "No matter  how good a game gets, it is still only a game instead of real life. But  the computer does have other uses. It's like a huge library at your  fingertips."</p><p>"Really? Hummm, what's the use of a library?"  Ranko asked. "I mean, I ain't really had much use for all those books and  stuff unless there were some martial arts scrolls in there."</p><p>Skuld  stopped what he was doing and thought deeply for a few moments while absently  staring at the redhead. Ranko was puzzled at first then blushed deeply  and turned away with a muttered imprecation, "Pervert!"</p><p>"What?  Huh? Oh, I'm sorry Ranko, I didn't mean to ignore you and stare at you like  that. I was just thinking." Skuld paused and then asked with a  puzzled expression on his face, "But why did you call me a pervert?"</p><p>"You  were staring at me. I always get called a pervert by Akane when she sees  me looking at her." Ranko paused and concluded, "That's why I called you  a pervert."</p><p>Skuld  scratched his head in confusion and then replied, "Well, I may have been a  little bit rude, but it was unintentional but certainly not perverted.   Any perversion you sensed was in your own mind, not from what I did."</p><p>Ranko  blushed again and then abruptly asked, "Well, do ya wanta train? I've  decided that I'll teach ya." As she said this, she absently cracked her  knuckles; apparently she had a bit of frustration to work off.</p><p>Skuld  nodded and stood, but he stopped and then asked, "But what about the bonding, do  you think that will interfere in training?"</p><p>Ranko  paused, then nodded, "Yeah, I don't think there are  exceptions to the rule. 'Member when I pushed you out of the way from  Mara's first attack? There was a counter shove on me even though we  weren't fighting. So I guess I can show you the moves but we won't be  able to spar." Ranko shrugged, "Not that it matters anyway. We are  so far apart in skill that sparring together wouldn't do either of us any  good."</p><p>"Ranko?" Seeing that he had her attention, Skuld  continued. "Why did you blush and call me a pervert a little while ago?"</p><p>The  redheaded girl hesitated, even going so far as scuffing her toe in the dust  before responding in a whisper. "I was imagining what you were thinking  when you were looking at me like that." She looked up defiantly, "I know  what I look like and it's good, real good. I've heard how boys talk about  girls so I thought that you were thinking those kind  of things about me." Ranko gulped audibly and then softly said, "I forgot  that you are really a girl just like I'm really a guy. You were right, the perversion was all in my own mind, sort of  anyway."</p><p>"Sort of? What do you mean?" asked Skuld, a bit  puzzled.</p><p>Ranko  blushed, "Well, it's sort of funny in a way. I've been called a pervert a  lot of times, but I really don't know just what it means. I sort of have  an idea that it's something bad that guys do to girls but that's about all I  know."</p><p>Skuld  paused and then softly said, "Ranko, I don't have a whole lot of experience  with all of that even if I am sort of old the way mortals measure time.   Because the future is my domain, I've always been a kid, sort of. But I  do know that you are missing a lot of knowledge that you should have. You  really should talk to your mother or some other adult that you trust. What you  don't know CAN hurt you, especially if you are a girl."</p><p>Ranko  paused, a puzzled expression on her cute face, "Really?" At his  confirming nod, she thought a moment and then apparently coming to a decision,  said, "Yeah, maybe you're right." She sighed again and grumbled, "I just  know that momma is gonna enjoy making me all embarrassed, but maybe it will be  worth it."</p><p>She  turned out to be right on both accounts when she asked her mother that evening.</p><p>Ranko  was absently wandering through the mall trying to ignore the guys that were  ogling her. She was supposed to meet with Urd for lunch in an hour and  they would go to court together afterwards. She was not looking forward  to it. Especially since that damn bracelet had already 'prettied' her up  twice this morning. She'd given up on getting rid of the earrings for now  and she was actually getting used to panties and a bra. She had to admit  that silk was pretty nice. For lack of anything else that was fit to wear  to court, she'd actually agreed to put on a dress that morning. It was  now a rather sharp business suit. Seems that the  bracelet had a link with the wearer and adapted its magic to the occasion.   She was not happy.</p><p>"Pervert!" It was all the warning that Akane gave  her. But it was enough as Ranko dodged the unseen mallet by jumping  straight up onto the open second story floor of the mall.</p><p>Ranko  leaned over the edge of the railing and coldly asked, "And just what is your  problem Tendou?"</p><p>Akane  was standing below glaring up at her; her friend Yuka beside her with a  disgusted look on her face. "You're a pervert you baka. How dare  you go around dressed like that?"</p><p>"Jealous?"  asked Ranko with a smirk as she posed slightly.</p><p>Akane's  face suffused with anger, she stormed up the stairs and stalked over to stand  in front of the redhead. "Jealous? Of what?   Of you? Don't make me laugh. You are just  a nobody; a cursed pervert who leads other girls on  with your womanizing ways. You have less honor  than even your worthless ole man. Your martial arts skills are all based  on dirty tricks and I'm tired of everybody believing that you are better than  me." She paused and continued with a malicious grin, "I challenge  you, right here and now. You always refused to spar with me, so let's  fight instead. Right now, or are you afraid of getting your dress dirty?"</p><p>Ranko's  face had blanched under this diatribe. A decision firmed in her mind; a  decision that was the culmination of months of earlier talks with Tofu and more  recent conversations with both Skuld and Urd. 'If I'm a girl, then I can  fight girls without loss of honor. I have the right to defend my honor  and myself.'</p><p>Ranko's  only response was to slip off her heels and put her purse down on top of them  before backing out into an open area of the mall. Her eyes had never left  Akane. Once she'd set herself she asked softly, "Your challenge, what are  the conditions?"</p><p>Akane  was momentarily surprised at Ranko's response but then grinned. She was  confident of her skills and really needed to work off some anger. This  was going to be fun and 'he' had it coming anyway; "Straight martial arts, no  dirty tricks or weird special moves." She handed her purse to Yuka and  took a stance.</p><p>"Terms?"  tersely demanded the redhead.</p><p>"When  I win, you drop all that ridiculous legal stuff against my sister." She  glowered and prepared to attack only to stop when Ranko asked.</p><p>"And  if you should lose?"</p><p>"I  never lose, especially to someone like you!" she screamed and attacked.</p><p>Ranko  simply invoked her father's hidden thief technique and vanished. Her  voice was easily heard though. "I will not fight under those  conditions. Either state fair terms for your loss or admit that you are a  bully."</p><p>Akane  stood there fuming, her mallet in hand. "I said no special moves.   You're already cheating."</p><p>"No,  I am not cheating for I have not agreed to the terms, therefore I am neither  fighting nor cheating," snarled Ranko still invisible but seemingly behind  Yuka. "Besides," she added, "you are pretty obviously a hypocrite seeing  as your mallet is a special technique."</p><p>Akane  blushed as she glanced at the mallet and noticed all the frowning faces around  her that seemed to agree with Ranko's assessment. She stored the mallet  again and began to angrily pace back and forth, searching for her foe.   "Alright, IF you happen to win without cheating, then I agree to apologize for  all the times I've insulted you. I also will not insult you  anymore. THERE!"</p><p>Ranko  sighed as she de-cloaked. "You seek to take away damages truly owed me by  your sister if you win and offer to give me what you already owe me should I  win. Typical! Very well, I accept for the chance of actually  pounding you for once instead of the other way around."</p><p>Akane  hesitated as Ranko almost snarled these last words. But confident that  her former fiancée would never harm her, she accepted with a feral smile and  attacked without further warning.</p><p>Ranko  slapped aside the incoming fist and dodged the rising knee as she gracefully  slipped inside Akane's defense and slammed a palm into the other girl's  gut. It was a gracefully executed but brutal blow that left Akane  kneeling on the floor puking her guts out and struggling to not faint.</p><p>Yuka  was stunned. The fight was unlike anything that she'd expected. She  stared at the well-dressed redhead who was smoothing out her dress after  putting her heels back on. She'd never believed that Ranma would have  ever hit Akane ever in his life. But somehow he was gone and that  redheaded demon was here instead; a demon of incredible skill that had no  problems defending herself.</p><p>"You  cheated. You had too. That was the only way you could have done  that to me." Akane choked out, tears of pain and frustration hoarsening  her voice.</p><p>"I  dodged a slow clumsy attack and countered with a single open palm blow like any  other skilled martial artist in defense and all you can do is cry 'cheat' like  a little three year old girl." Ranko paused and then added almost as an  aside, "I guess you really are a true heir of your pathetic school after all,  Tendou. Humph, 'like father, like daughter'. Know this Tendou, I will defend myself from now on."</p><p>She  walked away, her words spreading a wave of somber silence as she walked away.</p><p>Akane's  face paled as she heard these words and she whispered, "Oh, no, what have I  done. Ranma, I'm sorry." She struggled to her feet but Ranko was  already gone. Yuka did not meet her friend's gaze. She was  embarrassed for Akane's actions and words.</p><p>Akane  hurried after Ranma, catching her just as she met up with Urd.   Recognizing the pale haired goddess from Nabiki's description of her, Akane's  temper once more surged and she snarled. "YOU!   You are that damned attorney that's been harassing my sister. Well, I'll  just teach you to let the Tendou's alone." With that she swung a haymaker  for the taller woman. She connected and sent Urd sprawling.</p><p>A  triumphant grin on her face, Akane smirked, "Well, that's what you  deserve. Now let me tell you the way things are going to . . ."</p><p>That  was as far as she got before Urd nailed her with a mana bolt that left her  clothes in tatters, her skin almost parboiled and her hair shorn in a ragged  cut that smoked a bit. Ranko's eyes were wide with shock, but before she  could rush to help her former fiancée, Urd grabbed her wrist and whispered,  "Relax, Ranko. It looks worse than it really is. She's not really  hurt, a little sore perhaps and a whole lot embarrassed when she wakes up in  just a few moments. Leave her to learn this lesson without you rescuing  her again. If you interfere, she won't appreciate it; neither will she  learn from it either."</p><p>Ranko  looked into Urd's eyes questioningly, but then nodded and followed her attorney  into the restaurant for their meal and a final briefing together. Akane  regained consciousness just in time to see Ranko walk away from her. At  that moment something broke in her heart, she knew beyond any doubt that she'd  lost Ranma.</p><p>Yuka  had sunk to her knees beside her friend nearly sobbing, "Akane? Akane,  are you alright? Should I call for medical help?" She paused when  Akane sat up and then she helped Akane to her feet.</p><p>Yuka  barely heard her friend whisper, "Oh, Yuka. I really messed up. I  finally drove him away. Damn my temper anyway."</p><p>"Akane? Are you Ok?"</p><p>Akane  looked over at her nearly hysterical friend and then painfully replied, "No Yuka,  I don't think I'll ever really be OK again. But for now, all I want to do  is go home." She took a few painful steps away. She was either  unaware of how revealing her clothes were now in their damaged state or she  just didn't care. She held her hand out to her friend, "Come on, let's just go home before I make it any worse than it  already is."</p><p>Yuka  quickly took off her light jacket and wrapped it around the injured girl.   "Ok, let's go. I'll stay with you till you get home."</p><p>Author's  note: Additional Ranma fan-fiction can be found on my Web Pages.</p><p>C  &amp; C to cloud (underscore) dreamer2000 (at)</p><p>Web-page  - .com  (slash) cloud (underscore) dreamer2000</p><p>And  - .net (slash)</p>
