</div><p><b>Sailor Moon is the property of Takeuchi Naoko. Ranma 1/2 is the property of Takashi Rumiko. SENSHI is an original work based on the afore mentioned creators' works, done so without profit. </b></p><p>Peanut Gallery: As far as repeating scenes/chapters is concerned, it's probibly either that you are reading these stories right around the time I post them (When I posted the rewrites of chapters 00-02 and the new chapter03 of senshi, for some reason chapter 02 stayed the same as before the update till about a day and a half after the post.), the website is having difficulties (this I know from personal experience, as it has happend a coulpe of times to me during my little bouts of fic reading.), or your computer/bandwidth just can't handle the size of my chapters (if thats the case, then get a new computer/modem/service/whatever because whatever you must have works craptasticly and sucks big time). I do not repeat anything. Period. If its a flashback, I will copy certain parts and then write in that it is such; but even then it would be a 'reader digest' version, not the whole scene. My suggestion for you is to wait until at least a day after the site says I updated, then read what I have. If you still have problems, then e-mail me and I'll send you the chapters scene by scene. No more comments about repeating, otherwise no more comments from the peanut gallery. (yes pun intended.)</p><p>anonymous: You know, you could have at least made up a name... oh well. I am gald that someone gets a kick out the poem type things at the begining of all the chapters, but they aren't there just to look good... hehe. Sorry that I haven't updated in a while... I shall soon remedy that.</p><p>Katie: Ami does know about Ranma's curse. In fact she knows more than most people do. But as Ami said in chapter 1 (Walk In The Rain), Ranma made her promise not to tell anyone without his say so. Why would he confide in her you may ask? Because she was the only one not after him for something and he needed a shoulder to cry on so to speak. What about Kasumi? Well who says that Ami and Ranma were alone during their heart to hearts. Concidering that Kasumi's room was probibly the only safe place in all of Nerima to have such a talk, she would've been there too. As to Dark Star... hehe.</p><p>Kevin Joe Bays: You know, we've know each other for a year! Yeah, my first long term internet friend! Though lately with all my moving and such I haven't been able to talk much... sorry about that. Anyhoo, as you already know, I have never made the promise to not do a RSM... In fact, along with working on your's, I've got a grand total of 16 RSM fics (including SENSHI)! Sadly most may never be seen on the net, but I'll try get as many up, and to finish just as many. If you want to be technical, the number is actually 17, but then it's more of a guest star appearance... at least that is the plan. Yes I do have about 10 or so non-senshi fics... but they're still in the works. A male Ranma Senshi? ...hehe... Not going to tell... hehe... As for the truncy officer, lets just say, this fic will end how it begins... Ami is pretty cute, ain't she? Sorry about the Akane can't cook cliche, but at least it made sense with Makoto bringing it up. As for the 'hadoken-esque gestures', yes a definate street fighter reference. Ryu (prononced ree-you, it is a japanese name after all), Ken, Sakura, Gouki (original name of 'akuma'. on a sidenote: Akuma is still a 'japanese' name, 'Aku' -evil- and 'Ma' -demon-. basically 'devil man'), and even that dummy dan all do the same motion for their 'fireball'; this is the action to which I am refering. Yep I knew about the whole 'a-ko', 'b-ko', 'c-ko' thing. And it is funny. As for your question... this is the one point of the story where I wrote myself into a corner. All I know for that part thus far is that they had met in the past, she just doesn't remember. The only thing she does is that Ranma doesn't have a sister... Ooo, I just thought of something right when I was writting this... but I'm not telling. The airborn line I like too, but my favorite line that I wrote some far is '...Makoto was still grumbling and Minako continued to remain in the stupor of unladylike merriment at the expense of her rough-n-tough friend...' just a few scenes later.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>In times of great peril<br/>amazing warriors are called forth,<br/>sworn to protect the Earth, It's people,<br/>and their Queen.<br/>They fight tirelessly<br/>to destroy that which threatens<br/>life and innocence.<br/>These defenders of love and justice are called:<p><b><i>SENSHI</i><p>Chapter 00</p><p>In The End, In The Beginning</p><p>00-01-</p></b></p><p>A gentle rain sprinkled the streets of Juuban as he traveled his beat. As a truancy officer, he had to be on the lookout for delinquent students. He rather enjoyed his job with a bittersweet sense of fulfillment, guiding students back to the road of higher education. Whenever he saw a student walking the streets during school hours looking for trouble, it made him so angry. Though not really at them, but rather at himself for all the chances he had been given in his youth that he squandered way. It was this fire that he used to fuel his quest, his personal vendetta against the spirit of rebellion that sucks away all the incredible opportunities that are set before such impressionable youth. That was why he loved rainy days like this one, it encouraged students to stay at school; and the longer they were in school, the better the possibility that they would actually learn something. So he continued to walk his beat with a slight spring to his step and a smile on his face. Yep, all seemed fairly clockwork for a day like today...</p><p>Then she appeared.</p><p>A lone ratty looking figure clad in a tattered red chinese silk shirt and an equally tattered pair of silk black pants, trudged along barefoot down the street. He watched as the shuffling form of a girl moved without any seeming purpose, just forward motion. At first, he thought she might be one of the most despicable and sorrowful examples of the delinquent: a stoner, a junkie, a user of all things vile for body and soul. But as she got closer, his evaluation of her quickly changed.</p><p>Underneath the tatters he could see various scrapes and lacerations, what seemed to be only dirt turned out to be dried blood that was caked on nearly every part of her body, even her fiery red hair was saturated in patches of dark crimson. Her left arm was bent at a very unnatural angle, and all her knuckles were torn to the bone. Several deep gashes lay in a perpendicular fashion across the left side of her face while her right eye had swollen shut. He knew this sight all to well, after all his youth was spent in bounds of the cursed district of Nerima, even to this day he still heard of horrible battles that would leave terrible destruction in their wake. Of course such a sight as walking wounded was the norm in Nerima, but this was Juuban, the tenth district, things like this are anything but normal. Even with the battles that the Sailor Senshi fought, there was never really anything more than a few cuts and bruises as the youma were out for energy, not blood. Whatever this was, it was serious. He rushed forward to offer aid, but stopped short having caught the sight of the deep blue of her one good eye. An emptiness that flowed deeper still into a dark sea of sorrow and despair. He could feel her staring right though him. As she continued forward, he stepped aside. Looking now at her back, he was absolutely horrified. Her back was worse than her front, gashes and gouges criss-crossed her back. Whatever attacked her had very large claws; he would definitely have to write a report on this, a very long report. Watching her now, he got the distinct feeling that she was walking to a specific destination and that it was taking all she had left in her to keep going, hence the staggered gait at which she traveled. Sensing that it would be unwise to disturb her, he decided instead to follow her and make sure she made it to wherever she was going safely and alive.</p><p>He didn't realize how right he was. She had in fact been traveling with one purpose in mind, and a memory was all that held her together. She had to keep her promise. Each step was an eternity. Always forward. Never looking back. Never stopping. Through all the pain. Though all the sorrow. Forward. Each bloody step, still...forward.</p><p>Her destination...</p><b>-00-02-</b><p>Rei walked into the resturant, uncertain and cautious. The place looked ordinary enough, but something in the air sent a tingle down her spine that she could not readly ignore. After all, this was Nerima. She timidly continued into the main dinning area, hoping that she could get this over with as soon as possible. She idly wondered who it was that called her here and why. Thats when she heard a voice that sounded rough and aged, with just a hint of scratchy, that seemed to come out of nowhere. The words themselves were even more cause for alarm. For what the voice said was:</p><p>"Wecome, Hino Rei-dono, Senshi Of Flame."</p><p>Rei turned toward the origin of the voice and found a strange sight indeed. A person that looked like a shrunken mummy balanced on a stick. If it wasn't for the cackling laugh that exuded from what seemed to be a mouth, she would have though it dead.</p><p>"Come now, Hino-dono, we have much to discuss..."</p><b>-00-03-</b><p>His eyes snapped open and lept into a ready stance, tense and greatly alarmed. After a moment he realized he was back in his room. He relaxed his posture and thought over what had just happened to him.</p><p>"The last thing I remember was..." he took a slow look around him. The placement of the window, the lack of a decent bed, his father's futon folded in the corner. This was his room at the Tendo dojo, not his mothers house. "Was it all a dream?" Sitting down and looking at the calander to confirm what day it was, he realized what had happend must have been a dream. He knew that Kasumi kept all the calanders in the house fairly accurate. He took stock of the past week, "Let's see... First track Kiima to China, then the battle with Saffron... AKANE!"</p><p>With that, he rushed to Akane's room. Opening the door, he found her still asleep. After he let go of the breath he was holding, a very mischievous thought came to his mind. After a moment, however, he though better of the situation. 'Payback would be nice, but she just looks too peaceful.' For a moment he recalled the dream that felt just too real, then he remembered it was just a dream. But all the same, he smiled softly and then made his way down stairs to take a bath.</p><p>As Ranma entered the changing room, he removed his clothes and place them in the basket. He entered the bathroom and went about the nomal routine: douse with cold water, lather up, rinse. Then he stepped to the furo to soak for little while. When he felt relaxed enough he stepped out. That is when he realized something: He didn't fell the normal tingle that came with the change!</p><p>He rushed over to the sink and doused himself with cold water, expecting the change. Again not feeling the sensation he was looking for, he looked into the mirrior. A definately male ranma stared back at him. Wait, there was one difference. But that was a dream... or maybe the dream somehow changed his curse? With this thought, he splashed himself with some hot water.</p><p>"But it was just a dream! ...Wasn't it!"
