Could he be living a lie?</p><p><b><i>SENSHI</i><p>Chapter 01</p><p>Walk in the Rain</p><p>01-01</p></b></p><p>Forward...</p><i>'momma...'</i><p>Through the rain, through the aches, through the the horrid pain.</p><i>'help us momma...'</i><p>Still... forward.</p><i>'where are you momma...'</i><p>Where was she going? Where was she now? Who was she? Did it really matter?</p><i>'poppa did something terrible to us...'</i><p>The girl continued to trudge though torrential the rain as it pelted her greatly abused body. The sensation of pain had kept her mind aware just enough to keep going. No thought of stopping or slowing down, just a tenacious need to keep going. Strangers kept coming to close, and she didn't want to take chances. a few quick slashes here and there was warning enough to any who would try to detour her from her goal.</p><i>'i had to so the k..k..kitties wouldn't hurt 'kane-chan, momma...'</i><p>But just what was her goal? It didn't matter. Just that she kept going...</p><i>'please don't hate me for killing them, momma...'</i><p>...Forward.</p><i>'...momma, ...where are you?</i> <b>-01-02-</b><p>Rain. Grey clouds blanketed the sky and brought a somber mood to the city of Tokyo. Lightning flashed and the cry of thunder could be heard off and on. Little did the residence of the city realize that current weather was nothing more then the herald of a greater storm soon to come. Many just went about their business with their daily hustle and bustle, all be it just a bit more soggy then normal.</p><p>Outside of the Hikawa shrine, on the wooden floor of the porch sat eight senshi, two moon cats and a knight of the Earth. Sitting in a half-circle starting with Setsuna drinking her tea, dressed in a grey business suit. Her expression one of eternal contemplation. Then Michiru and Haruka snuggling with Hotaru resting in Michiru's lap. They, like their fellow classmates, were clad in their school fuku; having cut from classes early, much to ther chagrin (well, all save they princess and her 'second-in-charge') for this important meeting. To their right sat a deeply perturbed Makoto. A little further over Minako lounged with her back against the wall, her usual care-free mask gave way to concern; Artemis was curled up in her lap, his face set with far deeper worry. Ami busied herself with her studies to calm her nerves. And directly across from Setsuna sat their future Queen and her future husband, Mamoru on the left and Usagi on the right. Like the others their, faces were set in concern. Somehow, Usagi felt the need to sit face to face with the Senshi of Time. Luna, of course sat in her lap trying to get as much rest as she could before all hell broke lose, again.</p><p>"So why are we here? I mean, not that I don't like hangin' out an all, but, whenever Setsuna is involved things tend to get nasty pretty quick," Makoto miffedly stated. "No offense, Setsuna," she amended with swift politeness.</p><p>"None taken," the Senshi of Time spoke with her usual reserve as she took another sip of tea.</p><p>"Ya, didn't we finally defeat the entire Dark Kingdom, the Black Moon Family, Death Busters, Anima-Mates, Chaos and all that? How many times have we saved Tokyo, not to mention the rest of the universe? Yep, I say we deserve a serious vacation!" Minako ranted.</p><p>"Minako! If we are needed, then we must rise to the challenge. Though I too, am curious as to why you are here, Setsuna," Ami spoke in her usual curious tone.</p><p>"In due time, Ami. If I have anything to say, then it shall be spoken when all are present, as I do not wish to repeat myself." After taking another sip of tea, Setsuna placed the cup down on the table. She bowed her head and, as silence once more settled about them, listened.</p><p>Setsuna took in the rain's gentle tune. It always brought back memories of a past she could not remember. A boy. A girl. A destiny. A choice. And...a sacrifice. She could feel it deep in her bones; her mind may have forgotten, but her heart never would. The rhythmic pitter-pats of the droplets drummed a beat of joy-filled sorrow, a blessed song of pain and loss. Why could she not remember such an important event, what sort of dark force played havoc with her mind. A boy... no, a man..., what role did this shadow of her past hold in her life? The strange force that held back the prized memories she sot had, of course, an ally; time itself. She knew all to well the entropic force of time, even if the universe where to exist for all eternity, memories would still none the less bare against the grindstone of time slipping into the future.</p><p>Why indeed was she here and not searching though out time to find out who this shadow of her past was?</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>Her father?</p><p>Brother?</p><p>Husband?</p><p>...a ...son?</p><p>Suddenly she became aware of an occurrence that had not happened in since the fall of the Moon Kingdom.</p><p>The mask began to crack.</p><p>"Sorry to make you guys wait." Rei, wearing a simple red t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans, sat in between Makoto and Minako while grabbing the last cookie on the plate. A part of her mind rejoiced in the marvel that there was even one cookie left in the first place, and that it was all hers. Another part idly noted that Usagi, the prime devourer of said cookies seemed distracted by something over in Setsuna's direction. "I just got back and needed to freshen up bit. Running all the way from Nerima can take alot out of a person."</p><p>"NERIMA!" the tension was absolutely shattered. All eyes, save Setuna's and Usagi's, were on Rei.</p><p>"Your joking, right?" Haruka stared at her in unbelief.</p><p>Makoto looked her over with a slight panic. "Are you alright, did anyone attack you?"</p><p>"No, I'm fine, Mako-chan. In fact it was pretty quiet while I was there."</p><p>"What on earth were you doing in Nerima, Rei. Don't you now how dangerous it is over there? I don't think even our enemies would set foot in a place like that." Ami just stared at her, either she was brave or completely out of her mind. "It is home to high caliber martial artists, pervert demons, cat spirits, and various curses. The place is a pool of chaos and insanity."</p><p>"Ami, don't you have family there?" Setsuna interupted while picking up her tea to take another sip, her eyes remaining downcast.</p><p>"Yes, I do. I visit them about once or twice a year, usually during the summer." Ami paused for a moment in thought. With a bit of worry in her voice, she countinued, "Actually, we were going to visit Uncle Soun a few weeks ago. They canceled on us because of some family emergency that came up. I hope everyone's ok."</p><p>"How did you survive, Ami?" Minako's curiosity had peaked. She, like many others had heard the various rumors. If even half of them were true, then even all the senshi would have a run for their money just trying to walk down the street. To hear that Ami, being the weakest of the senshi, going in alone and coming back to tell the tale is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>Ami smiled faintly while thinking of all the times she had spent in that strange ward. After a moment she spoke up, "Usually things quiet down a bit during the hot months, but even then it's still pretty dangerous. The reason why my mother and myself are able to come back unharmed is because of our medical skills. There is some kind of unwritten rule that says skilled medical personal are of limits. Of course the doesn't keep paramedics out of the crossfire." Ami chuckles lightly at the memory she just recalled. "Now that I think about it, thats probably why Kasumi never got hurt. With as many of Dr. Tofu's books that she studied, I would not be surprised if she had no trouble get qualified as his assistant." She continued, her smile both wistful and mirthful.</p><p>"So is it true that there is some guy who can shatter a boulder with just one finger? And what about the demonic perverts?" Mamoru didn't quite believe in these urban myths, but thought it would be nice to finally get the real story.</p><p>"Yes, Ryoga Hibiki has a technique know as the Bakusai Tenketsu, or Breaking Point. I can assure you it does just that, break things, but it doesn't work on living beings. As far as the demons are concerned there is only one you have to worry about and that's Happosai. Actually, you really don't have to worry about it, Mamoru, but us girls should be on the look out. He is a world class martial artist and pantie thief." Mamoru's face bore a startled expression after Ami had finished answering his query.</p><p>The other girls that were paying attention bore worried looks upon their faces. "Your not kidding, are you?" Hotaru spoke, having been awoken by the ealier outburst.</p><p>Ami nodded her head in finality.</p><p>"Wait. Soun... as in Tendo?" Makoto asked with a worried look.</p><p>"Yes, why do you ask?"</p><p>Makoto paled for a moment and then spoke up, "So you related to Akane 'the Kitchen Destroyer' Tendo? She was barred from every single cooking contest in Japan."</p><p>"Oh come on Mako-chan, no one could be that bad at cooking," Minako chuckled.</p><p>Both Makoto and Ami gave Minako a 'trust us, it's that bad' look, causing the golden haired senshi back away and laugh nervously while a sweat-drop formed on the side of her face.</p><p>"I heard of this one guy that can throw a hundred punches in a second," Rei had finally spoken up. "Though, I didn't see anyone fighting, must less using such an impossible technique while I was there. I mean, I know that Jet li can thorw something like 30 or 40, but a hundred?"</p><p>Michiru, enjoying this little round of gossip, decided to join in. "I heard there is some guy going around stealing other peoples women and forcing them to join his harem. Is this also true?"</p><p>Haruka joins in as well with her own inquiry, "What about the person who can create energy blasts?" She completes the question with hadoken-esque gestures.</p><p>Before Ami could answer the previous three questions Hotaru took a stab at gaining some actual facts. "I also heard about one guy who could generate hurricanes with his fists. Who is he?"</p><p>Ami was taken back, all four questions could be answered with one name. She took a look over at Setsuna. Somehow Ami knew that the answer would peak her interest, if she didn't know it already. After taking a deep breath while signaling for the questioning to stop, she gave her answer, "The answer to who these people are is, for the most part, the same. Ranma Saotome. Although you where a little off, Michiru. Though the situation that surrounds him could be classified as a harem, he is far from responsible for it." Suddenly Ami got this cold glint in her eyes that no one had ever seen before. As she continued, her voice became as cold as the very element to which she was attuned. "Let's just say that if we are ever in Nerima fighting a youma, and we miss and strike an overgrown panda or a fat old man wearing a faded gi and glasses. Don't feel bad." The sudden change back to her old sunny self was a little less frighting, but none the less disturbs all present. After a moment to collect herself, Ami sighed and finished the explanation, "However, Ranma asked That I not go around telling everyone his life story. So unless it becomes important later, I will not answer any other questions about him."</p><p>After Ami's cold voice sent a chill down her back, Usagi had become distracted from her earlier preoccupation and finally spoke up, "Um...did I miss something?"</p><p>A vein bulged on Rei's forehead as she screamed at her princess, "Of course you did, meatball head! What kind of la-la land have you been visiting this time!"</p><p>"Rei, your being mean again! Waaahhh!" Usagi then began to cry, past reflection of a moment ago forgotten. Ami silently wondered if Usagi was related somehow to her Uncle Soun.</p><p>Before things could degrade an further Setsuna brought the attention of the group back to the subject at hand. "Rei, I do believe there was a reason for you to traverse such dangerous territory."</p><p>"Yes there was,this is why I went to that horrible place." Rei pulled out a small scroll and passed it to Setsuna, instantly forgetting about the argument with Usagi.</p><p>Everyone sat in silence as Setsuna unrolled the parchment. any discussion was cut short by the sight that was Setsuna's countenance. Shock mixed with horror and hope all at once, her eyes wide with surprise. She finally placed the scroll on the floor for all to see. For the most part it looked like a normal scroll, but upon closer examination one would find that half of the text was written in an unknown language and a strange mark at the head of the composition drawn in gold and black ink. The gold part Ami identified as the crest for the Sun, but what threw them all on edge was the crest of the Black Moon Family nestled within the former. All present paled at this new revelation and pondered it's meaning as Setsuna began to read:</p><i>"In the time before the great ice,<br/>the Eterna shall once more rise clad for battle.<br/>The shrouded sun shall herald the coming of the eight moons,<br/>the dark knight, and their goddess.<br/>Swords shall cross when the twin stars meet.<br/>Beware the second silence.<br/>Stand with the wild horse. Stand against the wild horse.<br/>When fall the eight moons, Look to the Dark crystal.<br/>When she who shines in the heavens falls to the lord of storms,<br/>So shall rise the Dark Star.<br/>The earth shall lose his gold, the protector of dreams shall stand defeated,<br/>The blood of Tsuki-Yumi must relinquish the precious flower of her birth-right.<br/>When Gungnir falls, enter the Eye of the Needle.<br/>To the twilight the dawn must surrender,<br/>and only then shall the dawn break twilight.<br/>When the mercy of silver and the grace of gold unite,<br/>All will return to the beginning."</i><p>"Is that all it says?" Michiru inquired.</p><p>"No there is more, but its in a language that only I can read," Setsuna replied as frantically wrote something on a piece of paper. "Quick, Ami and Hotaru, run to the first address. You will meet someone, take them to the second address that I have written down. You will know what to do when you get there. Now go, quickly!"</p><p>They weren't sure what was going on, but the look in her eyes told Haruka and Michiru that she meant <i>only</i> Ami and Hotaru. They simultaneously looked down at the little girl in question to find her to be looking up at them. Having fought by the inner senshi for a while, they knew they could be trusted to be alone with her and protect her. They nodded an affirmative to the unasked question brewing the young child's eyes. Hotaru then nodded to Ami, and the two where off in a heartbeat. They knew most of all not to question the Senshi of Time, for in time they would come to know the results, one way or the other. As they made their way down the steps out in front of the shrine, Setsuna answered another unasked question that was plain in the eyes of those who remained: What else did the scroll say?</p><p>"There is more on this scroll, but its in a special code. Each part of the code is unlocked as certain events transpire. I know I said that your final battle has already passed, however it would seem that I purposely locked away important memories that pertain to another threat that must have been to much for me to deal with at the time."</p><p>"Why?" Usagi asked with a touch of worry in her voice</p><p>"Probably because the foreknowledge would cause me to take actions that would endanger all of existence. Time paradoxes and all," Setsuna spoke having regained her center of calm while drinking another cup of tea.</p><p>An "oh" chorused out of the lips of all present.</p><p>Just then Setsuna came to an abrupt realization. "Rei tell me who gave you this scroll?" Setsuna had a strange felling that she knew who it was, but needed confirmation.</p><p>"The owner of the Nekohaten, her name was Cologne." Rei replied, then continued "The funny thing is, she knew that I was a senshi. Not just that, but she called me by name, ...both my title and my personal name."</p><p>"I thought so. I need to return to the Time Gate and check on some things. Now, if you'll excuse me." With that said the senshi of time walk through the portal before any could object.</p><b>-01-03-</b><p>Upon entering the pocket dimension the held the Time Gate, she began to run down a check list of things to investigate. Taking out a notepad and pen from her sub-space pocket, she wrote down various thoughts that had perked her interest earlier. Starting with the confirmation that she held import an memories that were locked away from her. Then there was this Ranma Saotome fellow, there was something about the name that rang a bell with her. She also didn't believe in coincidence. After all, Cologne was involved somehow in this. Both where amongst the more well known residents of Nerima ward. And finally Cologne herself. The scary part was that Cologne was the easy part. Ranma and her memories coupled with this scroll business would prove to be most irritating.</p><p>"Humm..." she thought. "Ranma,... Ranma... why does that name sound so familiar?"</p><p>With her thoughts in order, she turned her attention to the Time Gate itself.</p><p>"Time to get to work."</p><p>She would have laughed at the pun, had it not gotten old ages ago. And so she merely cracked a slight smirk and begun with her sworn duty.</p><b>-01-04-</b><p>A similar thought process involving the pigtailed boy was filtering through the analytical mind of Ami Mizuno as she rushed toward her destination. Like Setsuna, Ami never really believed in coincidence. Her uncle's family crisis, Rei's SAFE visit to the amazon elder, and four different questions arriving at the same answer. She had no doubt there was something that was brewing. Something big. Without a doubt Ranma had some kind of role in this. 'Poor guy, what kind of trouble is hunting you down this time?' she thought.</p><p>Currently she was running though a side street with Hotaru on her back. Even after her 'rebirth', Hotaru was still suffering from a weak constitution. As Ami continued to move toward their destination, she couldn't help but get that feeling that something was wrong.</p><p>"I'm sorry I am such a burden Ami, If only I were as strong as you," Hotaru spoke with a twinge of guilt and regret in her voice.</p><p>"Don't huff be silly, Hotaru. huff I need the exercise anyway."</p><p>Hotaru was about to make another comment as they exited the alleyway, but the site displayed before her derailed that particular train of though. "Amy, look!" she gasped in shock.</p><p>It was this moment that Ami found all her worries and concerns to pale in comparison to what she saw just down the street from her. As she tried to recover from her state of shock she thought to herself 'This is who we are supposed to help! But This is...'</p><b>-01-05-</b><p>Forward...</p><i>'the... c...c...cats are everywhere, momma...'</i><p>Like a march of the dead.</p><i>'momma i tried not to kill them, ..but they keep trying to hurt 'kane-chan...'</i><p>At this rate that was all it was going to be.</p><i>'i can't take it any more... it hurts to much... i'm sorry 'kane-chan... i'm so sorry...</i><p>Maybe that was her destination, the cemetery...</p><i><b>'RANMA! MAKE THEM STOP! IT HURTS! RANMA! HELP ME!'</b></i><p>No, she had come to far to give in to the pain.</p><i>'kane-chan... hold on... i'll get you home...'</i><p>If only that memory would stop flashing before her minds eye, perhaps then she could concentrate on where she was going.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"m..mercury-dono? ...saturn ...-dono?"</p><b>-01-06-</b><p><i>"We interrupt your currently scheduled programing for an important news bulletin. At 11:35 am, an unidentified person entered downtown Juuban. While it is unknown at this time whether this is a youma or just one of their victims, the police have given a warning that no one should attempt to go near the subject. We now take you live with our on-site corespondent Ryudo Saito.<p>"Thanks Miko. Now as you can see the subject appears to be female, standing at about 4'11", and is wearing what seems to be a chinese vest; or at least whats left of one. Miko, in the past 5 years of being an on-site corespondent I have never seen anything like this. The girl does not appear to be like any form of youma I have seen, and the wounds she sustained are not of the type the youma would inflict. On top of that, it would seem that anyone who comes within five feet of her get attacked by...something. It is unclear at this time whether its the girl or some unknown entity that protects her, but police have seen fit to form a sort of human barrier around her so that no one else is hurt. Also, evidence suggests that she is actually heading toward a specific destination. As to where that is is anyones guess. Wait a moment... Hey Koji, are you getting this?"</p><p>"What is happening out there, Ryudo?"</p><p>"It would seem a couple of school girls are going to attempt to help the subject. Judging from there uniforms, I'd say their from Juuban Academy... Wait, the subject is responding. It looks like the subject trying to speak."</p><p>"Ryudo, can you make out what she is saying?"</p><p>"No, I'm to far away to make anything out. However, she finally collapsed. The Juuban girls are helping her up and continuing in the same direction as the subject was originally heading."</p><p>"Does it look as though the danger has passed?"</p><p>"As far as to the public, I would have to say yes. For the girl on the other hand, from what I can see she has multiple lacerations and possibly a broken arm. I can't see how she survived this far, but there is no doubt in my mind that if she is not taken to a hospital asap she will die. I will continue to follow and keep you updated as much as possible. Back to you, Miko." click</p></i></p><p>Nabiki stepped away from the t.v. and sat back down on the couch. Her face set like granite. 'This does NOT bode well.' she thought darkly.</p><b>-01-07-</b><p>She didn't feel when her body hit the ground...</p><i>momma... 'kane-chan... i'm... sorry...</i><p>She didn't feel the girls pick her up...</p><i>...momma... 'kane-chan is safe in their hands... but... i can't go on anymore...</i><p>All she knew was that her mission was completed...</p><i>...i can finally rest...</i><p>They would take her to her mother...</p><p style="text-align:center;">"...'kane-chan..."</p><b>-01-08-</b><p>At the Saotome home near by, Nodoka was taking full joy in just relaxing on such a nice rainy day. She had wondered how long it would take her son to return home. Though he did seem to enjoy staying at the Tendo's, she knew he would not live there forever. Somehow she had felt it, a change in the wind, the movement of the stars. Something had tipped off her senses that such an occurrence was in the near future. Despite how well he and Akane might have gotten along, she just had this felling that he would soon leave that Tendo dojo and live with her. As his mother, she just knew. "Soon," she muttered to herself as she took a sip of her tea, "it will begin."</p><p>As if on cue, there was a knock on the door. placing the cup down on the table, she got up to answer the door.</p><p>"Coming."</p><p>Opening the door, she gasped in shock. In front of her were three girls and an officer. The first of the girls, supported the second's sad form. The third girl, short as she was, was on the other side trying to help as best as she could. Meanwhile the officer was directing some reporters away from the scene. But Nodoka saw none of this. All she saw was that one empty, hunting eye. A dark blue sea of defeat where there once was the clear summer sky filled with determination. This was not the look of someone who had simply lost a challenge, but of one who lost something more dear then life itself.</p><p>He was defeated.</p><p>Ranma Saotome had lost.</p><b>-01-09-</b><p>He was laid out amidst the ruin of an ancient fortress. The stars and the earth far above him, though he did not see. A figure approached with silent steps, and though she dimly shimmered her face remained unseen. Swift yet gently she raised her hand toward the youth, causing a change in the environment about him. The stars rushed in and surrounded his slumbering form. Each resembled drops of water, rather then the balls of light and fire they had appeared to be from a distance. The droplets condensed and formed a sphere before solidifying into what resembled an egg made of some dark gem stone. The lady walked forward to the shadowed ovum while placing her right index and middle fingers to her lips, then she placed said fingers against the hardened surface.</p><p>"Rest now, young hero. It is not your time yet... "</p><b>-01-10-</b><p>Dr. Tofu stepped out into the hall, closing the door to Ranma's room softly with a nigh-inaudible click. He looked all gathered and gave a tired sigh. Nodoka, Hotaru, the Mizunos, and even Cologne were gathered in worried anticipation. It had been two days since Ranma was found wandering the streets of Juuban. If it hadn't been for Ami and Hotaru, Ranma would probably be in the morgue at the moment. As it was, the current state of affairs had everyone on edge, Nodoka most of all. After a moment; which seemed more like an eternity, the good doctor spoke.</p><p>"Despite evidence to the contrary, Ranma will be fine. I do thank you, Dr. Mizuno, for contacting me before you went though any sort of major operations. As you yourself have witnessed from your visits to Nerima, Ranma is built of much tougher stuff than the normal martial artist. The coma that he appears to be in is actually a form of deep meditation. I suspect that this is what allowed him to make it so far in such a condition. He should come out of it in a few days."</p><p>"Umm...," Hotaru began nervously, "Dr. Tofu, why didn't my powers work right when I used them to heal Ranma-oneeonisan?"</p><p>"I believe it might have something to do with the way Ranma is channeling his ki right now. If my guess is right, he inversed his ki flows so that instead of radiating an aura, he locks, or rather weaves his ki though every molecule of his body. With how damaged his body probably was before you were able to heal him as much as you did, I would imagine that that was the only thing keeping him together. The fact that they are flowing in reverse is probably what is disrupting you powers. Hotaru, though your healing ability would normally comfort him and close his wounds, they would do more harm than good in his present state,"Tofu spoke in an almost fatherly tone to the young senshi. After a moment of thought, he countinued, "Strangely enough, this effect has also locked him in his cursed form; which is actually good because of that broken arm. I don't think the cast he has on right now would be able to stand up to the rigors of gender changing that the Jusenkyo curse inflicts upon Ranma."</p><p>"That is indeed fortuitous. But, wouldn't performing such a technique at his level kill him?" Cologne asked skeptically. In all her years she had never known anyone to survive the training to use the inverse technique, let alone use it. But then Son-in-law has always been full of surprises.</p><p>"Normally I would agree with you, elder. Using this particular technique at his level could easily deep fry his entire body and then some, but right now he has so little ki that if he released the hold on it he would die instantly. He has just enough left to keep himself together while his body mends, which will take longer. Right now, his life depends on this technique; so he can't afford to redirect any of his ki to stimulate the rate of healing."</p><p>"I though you said he would be alright?" Nodoka was not at all pleased where this conversation was going.</p><p>"Please, relax Mrs. Saotome. I have been his doctor for nearly two years now. If this were anyone else, then I would be inclined to just call the morgue. His body is that ravenged. However, Ranma has one of the most remarkable healing times I have ever seen a person possess, even with when he was low on ki. No Mrs. Saotome, this is Ranma we are talking about; as such I give him a week," the good doctor chirped happily.</p><p>Nodoka was as white as a ghost. "Only a week ...and then he's dead! How can you say this is ok! How can you be so cheerful!" She was yelling at the top of her lounges. To hell to being lady-like, this was her son for crying out loud!</p><p>"Mrs. Saotome," Dr. Tofu's tone was firm and absolute, leaving no room for argument, "When I said Ranma would be fine, I meant it. He will live. In a weeks time he will have healed enough to let go of the hold on his ki. Until then, he will not be able to replenish his ki reserves." Taking a much softer tone, Tofu continued, "Considering his track record for healing, I give him two weeks tops , after that, before his back to his best. Maybe less."</p><p>Nodoka let out huge sigh of relive.</p><p>"Its his mental state that I'm worried about." Tofu's face took on a grim countenance as he continued, "First off, he spent his entire journey within some level of Neko-ken."</p><p>"The Neko-ken?" Nodoka had a strange feeling she would be wanting to strangle a certain man-turned-panda in a moment. Something tickled at the edge of her memory.</p><p>Cologne looked up at Dr. Tofu, "I believe I should explain this one." Turning to Nodoka she explained the training process and the side-effects of the Neko-ken. Nodoka for her part remained calm, though the soft, measured thumb strokes on the hilt of her ever-present katana left little doubt to her true mental state.</p><p>"However, that is not the only thing that worries me about Ranma," Tofu returned their attention to the subject at hand. "If the Neko-ken were the only thing..." If it were possible for his face to become anymore grim, it was doing so at the mere though of what he had to say next. "Mrs. Saotome ...nodoka...," His voice became nearly a soft whisper.</p><p>She hesitated "... Yes?"</p><p>"I imagine that, living in juuban, you don't hear much about the current goings on of Nerima, do you?" he continued in hushed tones.</p><p>"No...," Nodoka dawled.</p><p>Dr. Tofu gathered his courage and spoke as only a doctor, with the sort of news he had to give, could speak.</p><p>"Mrs. Nodoka Saotome, your son's fiancée, Akane Tendo is dead."</p><b>-Preview of Chapter 02-</b><p>Nodoka's child has finally returned home,<br/>but at what price?<br/>And, while 'Ranko' begins her first day at Juuban Academy,<br/>everyone is left to wonder what has become of her 'brother' Ranma?</p><p><b>Next Chapter:<p><i>"A New Student"</i></p></b></p>
