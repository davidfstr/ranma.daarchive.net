</div><p>Sorry about the long wait, between losing a job, moving, then gaining a job, I haven't been able to concentrate on fic much...</p><p>But I am back!</p><p>Night-Owl123: The Insane Clown Posse fans write like that? To tell the truth, I didn't know. I just saw a line in a fic I was reading and thought that the way it was written was kinda cool for the Shadow Knight. The good news, for most of you at least, is that in the future, the Shadow Knights won't have many lines at all. In fact, that maybe the only time one speaks. Just so you know, the way I originally wrote it was like this: <b>THIS IS THE WAY THE SHADOW KNIGHT TALKED.</b> After talking with my sister, I agreed that it was a bit much. It probibly is still, but what can a guy do, ya know?</p><p>Running total on the most reviews wrote by one person are:</p><p>Jerry Unipeg (4) (of course all he ever does is pat me on the back... but sometimes that's all anyone needs. Thanks man.)<br/>Kevin Joe Bays(3)<br/>Sect (3)<br/>dogbertcarroll(3)<br/>Niana Kuonji(2)<br/>Adyen(2)<br/>taxzombie (2)<br/>Locke1 (2)</p><p>Sorry, this is only about a third of the final version; but you guys have been waiting so long that I thought I'd at least give you something... Again, I'm sorry...</p><p>The final version should be up next week. I've been dealing with being in training at a new job with slightly wierd hours. But I'm still working on them at least.</p><p>Slade3</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>With only one eye to see.<br/>With nowhere else to go.<br/>She arives.</p><p>One before her.<br/>The person possesses the answers.<br/>But the truth is not what she wants to hear.</p><p>Who is she?<br/>Where is she?<br/>What are the questions she seeks to ask?</p><p>Follow the light.</p><p><b><i>Senshi</i><p>Chapter 04</p><p>A Storm On The Horizon</p><p>04-01</p></b></p><p>While the Senshi rushed to the battle site, Mamoru took his own route. Transforming in to his alter-ego, Tuxedo Kamen made his way to one of the buildings above the combat zone. He got there just as the Senshi began to unlaod upon the strange beast, felt just surprised as they did when it still stood after the onslaught, and was shocked by the speed at which it dispatched the other Sailors. He was about ready to make his patented entrance when out of nowhere a cloaked stranger appeared; neatly cleaving the Shadow Knight's head from it's shoulders. He had never witnessed such a merciless attack before, not even during the fall of the Silver Millennium. Who was this stranger, just how powerful was he, and, most importantly, could he be trusted?</p><p>Only a moment after delivering the death blow, the cloaked stranger disappeared in the shadows; not that he had moved, rather the shadows had rose up to meet him, then spirited him away. Shaking himself out of his stuper, Kamen hopped down to help the others escape before anyone discovered them.</p><b>-04-02-</b><p>In a dark place, a lone figure stood looking out a window at the night sky. The room was a simple meeting room, with a desk, a couple of chairs, and not much else. With the lights off, the figure remained in deep shadow, thick and almost as black as night. Susano-o waited for Charon, knowing that she would soon make her report about the attack. Not that he needed her to tell him that the shadow knight was deffeated, just the specifics and how it may effect their future plans. In the mean time, he contented himself with thoughts of the past.</p><p>The past. Such a funny thing to think about, especially when he had the memories of two life times that he could relive. He had it all; power, riches, a woman to call his own, and rule over all that he saw. Then it was all taken from him by the very same woman who gave him birth. But soon it would not matter. Soon he would take back what was his. His empire would rise again.</p><p>And it would all begin here in Tokyo.</p><p>The sound of someone entering the room brought him out of his thoughts and back into the present. Turning, he addressed the expected intruder, "What is your report, Lady Charon?"</p><p>Lady Charon answered calmly, as if taking about the weather, "Just as planned, Lord Susano-o."</p><p>"So 'HE' has appeared? Are you sure that this ...Shrouded Sun is a nessasary factor in our plans. Are you sure he is not a danger to them?" The impossing figure of Susano-o showed no outward signs of worry, but it was plain only in the words he choose. He only ever showed this vunerability in front of Charon for the very reason of what she was and represented. After all there was only one other guardian of time, and she was to weak to be of concern.</p><p>Charon nodded, "He is a nessasary part of the plan. He is key to the great loop that is the composition of my plan that will succed in resurrecting your true power. Aside from that, he is of no concerned at this moment. Fear not his mechinations, for you will be victorious in the end."</p><p>Susano-o narrowed hes eyes slightly at the way the woman in front of him spoke. The same insufferable fashion that his mother, his grandmother, and even his wife had spoken; how he hated the hidden agenda that they had always hinted to, but never revealed. Unfortunately, Charon was to valuable to his own 'machinations' to do away with as of yet. Calming the slight rise in his temper, he continued with their exchange by moving on to the next bit of business, "What of the eight Lunar Eterna? Have they been gathered yet, and more importantly, do they remember?"</p><p>"Yes, but it is not time for them to act yet. And when they do, their first battle should be done without removing the locks placed on them by the First Queen of the Silver Millennium," Charon spoke in the same unerving tone.</p><p>The Dark Lord let it slide this time, however, as he knew the reason for this action. It was one of the things in this plan the he wanted. After all, he maybe a vile, blood-thirsty, evil overlord; but that didn't mean that he lacked honor. It would be no fun to tear his enemies apart with a highly unfair advantage. He knew that being honorable would open the chance that his enemies could win; on the other hand, he would rather be beaten in a fair fight,then relish in ill gotten gains. He knew, from the example that his father set, what that could do to him in the long run. He wanted to rule with an iron fist, and that required all to know the full extent of his power. He held a slight and mirthful smirk as he continued the conversation, "Good. After the next attack..., introduce them to the Senshi. That will be all for now."</p><p>"As you wish, M'lord," Charon spoke as she bowed low, after which she left the room as quietly as she entered.</p><p>Susano-o returned to his window, and his thoughts, "Soon, spawn of Tsuki-yumi. Soon we will meet on the field of battle and you shall see just what I am really made out of. Your grandmother will regret what she did to me!"</p><b>-04-03-</b><p>Opening her eyes, she found nothing but a vision of pitch black. It was cold, lonely, and very mouch not a place she wanted to be. It almost felt as if she were floating; through what, however, she did not know. And how she got where ever 'here' was, was another mystery. With nothing as a point of refrence, she looked to and fro for some sign of life. Finally turning around, she found it in the form of a distant light. Making every effort to move toward it, she was suprized when she suddenly had a sufface upon which to stand. After testing the firmness of the apparent ground under her feet, she began her jouney toward the strange light.</p><p>As she drew closer, she saw that there was a structure within the glow. Several pillars stood in disrepair, ruins of a small clearing within the darkness. Reaching the closest pillar in the circle, she stood slightly behind it so that she may be able to get a better look at the surroundings before anyone saw her. Beyond her stood the most beautiful woman she ever saw; clothed in a grand nobles kimono colored like that of the sun, bight and vibrant. On her head, a simple piece of gold wrapped around; though she could not see the lady's face directly, so she wasn't sure if there was any other details about the circlet. The noble's hair was a fiery scarlet, loose between her shoulders. The woman stood as if waiting. For the time, she could not see anything else about the noble, so looked on to see what else was of interest in the area.</p><p>Her search was rewarded with the sighting of a strange egglike thing just a good few feet to the side of the lady. It was as tall as a full grown adult, and as wide as two standing side by side. It sat in the center of the ruins, as if it had a great importance, though what that was, she could not fathom. Also of intrest was the 'shell'; despite being as pitch black as the lonely nothing she had left just moments before, the egg was slightly transparent, revealing that someone resided within.</p><p>Before she could make any further assessment of the dark ovem, she saw another girl enter the clearing. This new entrant suprised her quite a bit more than anything else thus far; this new girl looked just like Ranko. She wore her usual red and black garb; but she was uninjured, save for her right eye, which appeared to be missing. She walked with a sure gait toward the lady, and that is when she realized the most suprising thing of all: the lady looked similar, kinda like an older sister. After a moment 'Ranko' spoke first, breaking what seemed like an eternity of silence.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"My title is Amaterasu Oumikami. However, before we can continue," the lady turned toward one of the pillars to the left of her and smile in a motherly fashion. "You can come out now, little firefly."</p><p>Hotaru realized that she had been caught, but she didn't seem to be in trouble for it.</p><p>"Do not fear, Senshi of Silence, for I know who you are and I am quite impressed that you have found this place so soon." Amaterasu knelt down to Hotaru's level as the little girl timedly walked out of the shadow of the pillar. Once Hotaru was close enough, the majestic, shining woman reached out a hand and softly caressed her cheek. The Lady spoke again with the same motherly tone, but this time it was lace with slight regret, "Too soon, I'm afraid. Forgive me, M'Lady Saturn, but what is here is not for you to see just yet. Till next we meet." And with that she gently positioned her hand in front of Hotaru's face, and as she moved it down over the firefly's eyes, she couldn't help but close them.</p><p>"Till next we meet, after you have completed the task set before you."</p><p>Then all faded like the dream Hotaru had taken it for in the first place.</p><b>-04-04-</b><p>She wondered about her child, it had been a week since the incident that brought Ranma back into her life. Nodoka was thankful for that of course; but something about the way her child locked away his memories set her on edge. Not just that, it seemed that once again the curse was locked. While that was good for the wounds Ranma has sustained, she couldn't help but worry.</p><p>However, the time for answers will come. So with that thought in mind, she went to turn on the t.v. to watch her late night soaps. With all the commotion she had missed out on the last week of happenings, and that could get you lost in the current events if you wait too long. Time to play catch-up.</p><p>Catch-up, unfortunately, was not on the minds of the news reporters that night; all Nodoka got to see was the 'important news bulleten'. Though that was a suprise in itself. As she watched the coverage of the aftermath of the onslaught, she began to add new things to the list of things to worriy about.</p><p>At least most things were going acording to plan...</p><b>-04-05-</b><p>Hotaru slowly opened her eyes again. Above her was a not-so familiar ceiling, and for a moment she was confused. What had happened to the clearing? And that beautiful woman, what of her? Taking a moment to calm herself, Hotaru remembered what it felt like to be in her presence; it was like being around Usagi when her true nature surfaced, like it was earlier. With that thought in mind, finally she realised just were she was: the Hikawa shrine.</p><p>Becoming more aware of her surroundings, Hotaru noticed the muffled confersation coming form the other room. From the multitude of voices she knew it had to be a Senshi meeting. Still aching from her intimate introduction with the front end of an S.U.V., she got up slowly and made her way into the other room to join with her teammates. As she entered the room, she found a sight that she never thought she'd see.</p><p>While no one had any broken bones or major wounds of any sort, thanks to their magical endurence and healing abilities, the dispare of defeat hung heavy in the air. She could see it in Makoto and Haruka's eyes the most, as they were the most capable in a hand-to-hand battle. They had all quieted down, having noticed that she was up and about. Before anyone could make any comments, she set about the task of healing as many injuries as possible; but when she walked up to the first person, Michru, she was stopped by a soft hung and an assurence that it was unnecessary. So she just contented herself with sitting in the Senshi of Water's lap and waited for the ealier conversation to be struck up again.</p><p>After a moment Rei spoke up, "What I'd really like to know is what's the deal with the blood? Is it a new way of gathering energy or something?"</p><p>"From the small amount of scanning my computer did before the Shadow Knight was killed by that new comer," Ami shook her head with a negative responce before continuing, "I'd have to say no."</p><p>Setsuna, nursing a minor tweek in her neck, sighed, "You are right, Ami."</p><p>"Do you remember anything new about our enemies, Setsuna?" Usagi asked softly, still shaken by what she had seen.</p><p>"Not much. Just that the soldiers of the Gold Empire aren't like anything we ever faced before. Each warrior is self-sastaining, and their primary motive is more than likely the resurection of their rule over this solar system. What has me worried is that they seem to be waiting for something. I'm not sure, but I get the feeling that they have a lot more then just one knight in reserve."</p><p>Haruka did not like what she was hearing at all, "You mean there is more of those monstrosities!"</p><p>"Well, I don't know for sure," Setsuna paused for a moment in thought, "But we'll find out one way or another soon enough. Right now, I think we all need to get some rest." Seeing the odd looks she was getting, the Senshi of Pluto just had to smirk, "Tommorrow is a school day after all." Several groans met this statement, but no arguments were brooked. After getting permission for her friends to stay, Rei got out enough futons for all. It was not long after that the sounds of sleep permiated the shrine.</p><b>-End of Current Work on 04-</b> <b>-More to Follow-</b>
