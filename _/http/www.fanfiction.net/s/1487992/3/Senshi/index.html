</div><p>Aleh: You are the only one thus far that was basically negitive. And all you said was 'Lots and lots of grammar errors.' That does NOT help me. Also, it would be nice to know what you thought of the artist work, grammar is merely the technical dressing. i.e. what did you think of the story itself? A NOTE TO ALL, COMMENTS ABOUT GAMMAR ALONE DO NOT FLY, HELP ME OR DO NOT BOTHER! I ALL READY KNOW THAT MY GRAMMAR IS FAR FROM BEST. TEACH ME! Folks it has been over four years since I last stepped in an english classroom, and even then I didn't do to well. Not that I was stupid mind you, rather that I was a fool. When you don't bother doing the homework, you tend not to retain as much.</p><p>Niana Kuonji: Hehe, hi sis. Yep, less ditziness for Usagi! Sorry I haven't sent you anything to spell check, and I still have to read the rest of your fic... I really need to get back to that one... Oh well, thanks for lookin out for me. hugs :3</p><p>Stratagemini: While the prophecy has change a bit (cut out the 'chaos demon' part and added a lot more after that...), the result is still basically the same. I will say that, yes the prophecy does refer to Ran(ma/ko); there is simply no question about that. What must be asked is 'how can Ran(ma/ko) be an enemy and a friend?' or 'who are the eight moons, the dark knight, and their queen?'... The fun part about these questions is that I won't answer them directly. As the story unfolds, all will be revealed. As for why Ranko is up so quickly, because it's a week after she trudged through town, and it is Ran(ma/ko) after all.</p><p>Vixen2: Though that was stuff I had already know for the most part (by the way, I think the galactic senshi as you called them are actually called the 'astroid senshi', but then I could be wrong), thank you just the same. I was more of looking for some specifics, like exactly what happend, move for move, during the last parts of the manga/anime. Oh well, since then I have come acrossed several resources, though I'm not sure how reliable they are...</p><p>CuteMooglez: I am gald that my story was able to touch you in such a way. You, my dear friend, are in for a real treat.</p><p>dogbertcarroll: Pluto/Ranma pairing... Nope. Not this one. I don't really have any Pluto/Ranma pairings planned with any of my fics, sorry. The pairing will be Ranma with -A- senshi; but as to whom that will be, I'm not telling. All I can say is that some will be happy, some will not. Either way, all will be suprised. Don't woory aobut the mysteries... Begining in chapter 7 (Ruby Eyes Ranko) things will start to come together...</p><p>Chaos Lord: Thanks for your kind words, and as for Ranma/Ranko's current gender situration... Let's just say that what you see is not what you get...</p><p>taxzombie: Yep, there can be well written RSMs, cool isn't? I hope that this is as smooth as it had been the first time. as you can see, not only have I updated, but I have also rewritten various parts thoughout the fic. So you like mysteries? Well this fic is going to be full of them... Funny this is that I never really intended for there to be some much... Sorry about that. Anyhoo, I do hope you enjoy!</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A boy.<br/>A girl.<br/>A battlefield.<br/>A dieing hope.<br/>An unreturned, desperate embrace.<br/>A still form.<br/>A single tear.<br/>A ground shattering force.<br/>In the end,...<p>he lost.</p><p><b><i>SENSHI</i><p>Chapter 02</p><p>A New Student</p><p>02-01</p></b></p><p>The wind swept passed the battle torn field in Jusendo. No one, not even the phoenix people dared to set foot on the desolate land that once was a beautiful spring. Everywhere there was blood. Rusty crimson mingled with the cold, deep tan of earth. In the middle of the field was the hilt of what once looked to be a dark, yet grand sword of awesome power. The blade's shattered bits littered the ground. Amongst this once powerful artifact, many deep ditches were craved into the unforgiving earth, looking like some outrageously large beast had attacked the combatants. From the evidence one could easily come to the conclusion that the beast won.</p><p>It was on this space of land that the Senshi of Time appeared. The wind, teasing her deep green hair, carried with it the stench of blood and death. Unphased by the disturbing stimuli, she made her way to the shattered artifact.</p><p>'Why can't I see the event that brought this destruction? Who fought here?'</p><p>She pause her train of though upon seeing the sword hilt. It had a distictly Japanese design to it, but what was left of the blade was composed of some strange dark metal, and it reeked of magical force. There was something familiar about that particular design of hilt, she just could not place it. She knelled down and took the handle up into her grasp and dusted of the hilt to get a better look. It was then that she saw it. For the first time since she could remember she was truly frightened.</p><p>'But ...this can't be.'</p><p>Looking back at her from the hilt was a crest. THE crest. The black moon within the golden sun. Of course she knew what it was, this was the same crest as on the parchment. But now, she could <i>remember</i> it.</p><p>"The Gold Millennium Empire! That can't be! Everything was destroyed."</p><p>In haste she pulled out the scroll and unrolled it. She found, to her horror, that she could read the next line of the cryptic markings.</p><p>"Oh God in Heaven...," she whispered. "NO!" she shouted. "no..." she fell to her knees.</p><p>Once more the mask cracked.</p><b>-02-02-</b><p>Another day. Wake up, get dressed, eat breakfast, go to school. A day just like any other day. The sky was blue, the grass was green, and the sun was bright. All around Juuban life was getting back to normal. It had been a week since the death march of that wounded girl. Juuban had been in an uproar, tightening security, putting up a curfew, and making pleas for the infamous Senshi to keep guard in case youma attacked.</p><p>But that was a week ago. Without any further signs of hostility, people once again slipped into complacency. How soon they forget the past. Lighting never strikes the same place twice.</p><p>And never the same way.</p><p>Everyone in Juuban relaxed and went back to everyday life-as-usual. Well almost everyone. As four particular teens made their way to school, their minds were completely locked on to the current situation.</p><p>"So, no one has found anything yet?" Usagi hoped that it would be a no. She was tired of the whole 'fighting evil by moonlight' stuff. Ever since the beginning she just wanted to be a normal girl, not some mahou shoujo. Well, she didn't mind the powers, it was just the fighting that she didn't like. Everytime they faced a group enemies, someone dies. Just thinking about the possibility of having to go through that again caused her to tighten her grip on her bento.</p><p>"Nothing yet. But remember, thats usually how this sort of thing starts. And don't forget about that strange prophecy," Rei said with a flat tone.</p><p>"Yeah, that was kinda weird. I mean what kind of whacked out message is <i>'Stand with the Wild Horse, stand against the Wild Horse'</i>?" Minako gave a shrug, "Oh well, not much we can do about that at the moment now, can we?"</p><p>All were clad in the same school uniform: sailor style with a sky blue and white color scheme, complete with a red scarf. The three girls continued their talk while the fourth, Makoto, mumbled to herself. Ever since that meeting last week she had been plagued by the nagging feeling that she was forgetting something. She couldn't stand it, it was right on the tip of her tongue. That damn name kept rolling around in her head.</p><p>"Mako-chan, what's up? you haven't said a word all morning," Usagi spoke with the same deep concern that Makoto had come to respect over the years they had known each other.</p><p>"Nothing really, it's just... Well I got that damn martial artist's name stuck in my head and I'm not sure why. I'm sure that I've heard the name Ranma Saotome somewhere else, but for the life of me I can't figure out where," Makoto finished her mini-rant with a heavy sigh. Why couldn't she remember?</p><p>"Maybe he is your old sempai?" Minako teased.</p><p>"No, that's not it. As far as I can remember I have never met the guy. No, it has to be something else. Hmmm..."</p><p>"Hey guys, look over there," Usagi pointed at a young girl being accosted by a small gang of boys. It was clear even from a distance that the boys didn't mean well. Strange thing though... that red headed girl looked kinda familiar.</p><b>-02-03-</b><p>Moments before the school bound Senshi came into view, the boss of a local gang spotted a potential victim. He curled his lip in a vile smirkand stepped forward. 'Even if you are wounded, if you pass though our territory, you have to pay the fee," he thought to himself before giving the singal to his lackies. Moving quickly to block the girl's path, the gang had formed a circle around their target.</p><p>"Well, well lil' girly, looks like ya stepped onta the wrong road. This is our turf and no one leaves without paying the price," the overgrown bully gave a wild grin. "But don't worry yer lil' head 'bout it if ya don't have the cash. There's more than one way ta pay the toll. Heh, heh, heh," with the last comment a hard glint could be seen eminating from his eyes, as did the rest of his motley crew. They all broke down into a fit of vile chuckles filled with perverted mirth, so much so that they had almost missed her reply, almost.</p><p>The words themselves had been nothing new to the band of fools. No, it was the sharp, cold attitude that coated each syllable that gave them pause. The very weight of the tone given to each word seemed to speak volumes of a lethal, unspoken threat.</p><p>"Let me pass."</p><p>Three simple words. The fools proved that they did have a brain cell between them and parted like the Red Sea. It was at this moment that Makoto had finally entered the scene, rushing up to the bandaged, pigtailed girl. Pausing for a moment to glare at the gang of hoodlums, she then turned her attention toward the red head in question.</p><p>"Are you alright?" she asked. Though this girl had displayed incredible strength of will, that didn't mean she was unshaken. She attempted to place a comforting hand on her shoulder, only to have it swatted away before it could take purchase.</p><p>"Leave me alone. I don't need the help of a weak little girl." The tone use was the same cold heart that spoke a moment ago. The same threat. It had said quite clearly 'leave me alone and you won't get hurt.' Why had the girl threatened her, she was only trying to help. On top of that, why add that last quip? Every time Makoto thought over in her head it made her more and more down right pissed off. She was by no means weak and most definitely not little! Another Comforting hand reached out; unlike that last one, this one found purchase. And unlike the last one, it was Usagi's hand on Makoto's shoulder.</p><p>"Mako-chan, it's not worth it, Come on, we got to go meet up with Ami." she stated with a slight smile on her face as if she had seen something that Makoto hadn't.</p><p>Turning back down the route toward school Makoto couldn't help but have a bad feeling about all this. First Ranma Saotome, Then the mysterious girl from a week ago, now this: a redhead with a glare that could burn a hole through you had it not been so cold. The funny thing was, that girl was somewhat reminiscent of the child Makoto herself used to be.</p><p>And that's what pissed her of the most.</p><b>-02-04-</b><p>The engine of her Viper roared and she turned another bend in the road. 'Boy, wouldn't Haruka by jealous if she ever found out I had one of these,' she thought to herself with a slight smirk. It was very rare for one to find Setsuna driving through town, but this was a special occasion. She watched in anticipation as she flew around the last bend. She never had seen a sight this beautiful since the end of the Silver Millennium.</p><p>To those who didn't know it appeared to be just a very classy, gigantic school. With three main halls and two gyms, each the size of a football field situated in a pentagon, this massive structure was equipped to house all levels of education. Around the perimeter of the school grounds were several dormitories that were still in the middle of being constructed, they would of course be ready for the next semester. All throughout the premises, vast fields could be seen; some for the multitude of sporting events that would be held throughout the year, a good portion just for the sake of lounging, and yet still others that would soon become gardens of such decadent grandeur that they would continue to be praised as the most beautiful on the planet for many hundreds of years to come. To those few who knew the true value of this partition of land it was the five story crystal spires that sat at each of the corners of the school that held the true meaning of it's construction. But for Setsuna it was even much more beautiful and special. This was the first tangible evidence that Crystal Tokyo was going to become a reality. This was the culmination of a thousand years of hard work.</p><p>This was Juuban Academy.</p><p>As she pulled into the parking lot she let out a small sigh of contentment. Despite the signs of dark times looming ahead, the drive to her 'day job' was always a breath of fresh air for her. After a moment of basking in the peaceful sanctuary that was the driver's seat of her car, she gathered her things and stepped out of the vehicle, ready to tackle another peaceful school day. With all the bad news lately, at least she had a heads up on the first attack on Tokyo.</p><p>"That reminds me, I'll have to warn Serenity-hime. Maybe during lunch," she thought to herself as she remember those looming dark times.</p><p>Oh, and that notion of a peaceful morning? Shot down the second she walked into her office. Funny, actually, how a simple, small file can ruin such a wonderful start to a beautiful day. In fact, it wasn't really the file that was a problem. It was the name on the tag that caused her said grief. She didn't know the actual history or anything like that, which was quite odd considering who she was. For some reason she couldn't find anything on the family. She had a feeling it had something to do with her locked memories. Regardless, she had a feeling that wherever this family name appeared trouble was sure to follow.</p><p>"Mmmm... Maybe I finally can get some information on her family. I'll have to fit her in after I speak with Serenity-hime. Interesting, the kanji used for this particular name. 'Wild child'. Strange, I truly hope this has nothing to do with the prophecy. If she does then I'll really have to keep my eye on her, this Ranko Saotome..."</p><b>-02-05-</b><p>The bell rang, signifying the beginning of the first period, much to the chagrin of more than a few students. As the teacher; a long haired red-head standing at 5'4'', wearing a golden yellow, long sleeved blouse and a pair of black slacks with simple black dress shoes; walked in the class as the representative stood.</p><p>She shouted, "Stand. Bow. Sit!" The class did likewise.</p><p>"Good Morning, class. Today we have a new student. I know it's a bit late in the semester, but I expect you all to be on your best behavior and treat her as one of your own," Ms. Daihoshi adjusted her glasses and turned to look toward the door.</p><p>It was Rei who first felt it, but then one by one each and every other student took notice to the ever so slight drop in temperature. The door, which slid open with almost no sound, was closed in the same manner. no footsteps could be heard and the grace that exuded from the figure was only slightly hindered by a wince of pain ever now and again. As the girl's journey ended near Ms. Daihoshi's desk, the class could not help but gaze in wide eyed shock. The bandages where clean, but the multitude of them suggested that extensive wounds lay underneath. Her left arm was in a cast and sling, and her right eye was patched with gauze. Her remaining eye was open, but no one could look a way from the cold dark emptiness that seemed to give the dark blue a much blacker hue.</p><p>First she wrote her name on the black board; then, after turning around she spoke in a voice who's beautiful and soft tones were wasted on the crude, monotone timbre that enveloped her speech.</p><p>She was the girl from the news reports last week.</p><p>She was the survivor that almost walked from one end of Juuban to the other.</p><p>She was...</p><p>"Ranko Saotome ...sorry about this."</p><p>She didn't quite know why, but this phrase seemed to fit the situation somehow. As if she were apologizing for future events that were sure to follow. She had a strange feeling that chaos loved to hang around her. It was only matter of time until something would go wrong.</p><p>"Would you like to answer any questions, Ms. Saotome?" the teacher asked cautiously, something had told her she already knew the answer.</p><p>"No." It was simple. It was flat. It was what the teacher had expected.</p><p>As she took the seat assigned to her, to the left of Usagi and in front of Makoto, Ami and Usagi could not help but stare at the girl's name. They looked at each other and gave a nod that indicated that they would be talking about whatever was on their minds at a later date. Meanwhile Makoto became even further stumped. Though she could not yet remember Ranma Saotome, she did know that he didn't have a sister.</p><p>Rei had also found herself lost in thoughts concerning the latest transfer student. Since when did peoples ki flow backwards? She could barely tell that the girl had any ki when Ranko had first walked in, as if she had been dead. But if the tight level of control this strange girl had exhibited was any in indication, then this girl had to be a martial artist of more than exceptional skill.</p><p>Minako to had felt something but could pin down the feeling quite yet. Was it recognition? No, she was pretty sure she had not met her in this life. Maybe in the Silver Millennium? Possible, but even if that had been the case, what she felt was different. Not love, well at least not the sexual kind anyway. Was she a friend? An enemy? Maybe both? This was definitely on the 'ask Setsuna' list. To bad she didn't know how clueless the Senshi of Time was at that particular moment.</p><p>The Senshi continued on with their various thought process, Ms. Daihoshi began the days lessons. History, not all that hard, but quite a chore to stay wake though. After the class was over, several of the other students crowded around Ranko, asking various questions pertaining to last weeks events. The only answer to their questions she would give was 'Leave me alone'. The ice in her voice would have rivaled a glacier. Hearing her response, many of the students thought it wise to do as she said and backed off.</p><p>As the classes continued, she found that each one was more boring than the last. Of course old Habits die hard. During math, she finally began to slip into a quaint nap.</p><p>When the teacher noticed this, he tried to get her attention. After that failed, he threw the piece of chalk that he was writing with at her. Now, he was not surprised when she didn't wake to his summoning, after all he did have Usagi as a student. But, when Ranko actually caught the air born writing utensil without even stirring in her sleep, he was a little shocked. She was still sitting there, slumped in her seat and obviously snoozing away. He would not be defeated though. 'With a hmph', he began throwing a barrage of various school supplies, each one failing to hit the mark as they were caught right before impact. In a final act of desperation, he threw an oversized, hardbound dictionary at the offending target. This time however, the ammo soared past as Ranko choose that moment within her sleep-induced state to get more comfortable by using her desk as a pillow.</p><p>Having depleted his ammo and with little patience left, the teacher deiced he'd be better of just continuing the class and spare his last nerve.</p><b>-02-06-</b><p><i>"Once again I'm standing before that demon, blood and sweat pouring off my tried, torn body. The battlefield lay about us, tattered and scared. In the beast's claws, the very reason for the confrontation. Her sad form, withered and sickly; her eyes, glazed and empty of all emotion; her expression, pained and sorrowful. I couldn't hold back any longer, it was now or never. Everything I had tried up to this point had proven useless. The minor bit of control over the Neko-ken seemed a waste. Even the terrible Neko-ken was countered and defeated. There had to be away. There was no way in hell it could end this way. If only more of these damn memories would come back!<p>"Then I felt it.</p><p>"No, more than that. I heard it. It was a voice, and the words that flowed from it were spoken in a dark and hate-filled tone."</p></i></p><p><b><i>"Unhand the girl immediately! Kill her and seal your own fate. I, DARK STAR command this!"</i></b></p><b>-02-07-</b><p>She had woken with a start. As she became once more aware of her surroundings she realized the bell had just rung, signifying the start of lunch. Without much care about the strange looks her fellow students were giving her, she began to make her way to the roof so that maybe she would have some privacy. An announcement came over the P.A., but it had nothing to do with her so she paid no mind.</p><p>As soon as her form was no longer in sight everyone in the room let out a collective breath none had realized they were holding. After all, it wasn't every day that a girl could catch objects thrown at her in her sleep, let alone walk like a panther on the prowl when awake. More so, even a fool knows not tempt fate by pestering a wounded animal. Ok, so maybe a fool would, they are called fools for a reason after all. Regardless, these folks were not fools.</p><b>-02-08-</b><p>"So you are telling me that this new enemy will attack tonight?" Usagi stood hoping that this would be a short meeting so she could return to her meal.</p><p>"Yes, I will give you the exact details at meeting after school. By the way is there anything you can tell me about Ranko Saotome?" Sitting back in her chair, Setsuna regarded her charge with a critical eye. She knew that her princess was an excellent judged of character. It was something that had always impressed the ancient woman.</p><p>"Same as you. The details will come later," Usagi smiled a 'cat-got-the-canary' kind of smile. For the first time she knew some thing that Setsuna didn't. Part of the proof was that the Senshi of Pluto had yet to act on any possible knowledge about the situation. The other part was the put-off look that had crossed Setsuna's usually stotic face.</p><p>"I see..., getting me back for all the times the I scared you and held back on the whole story?" Of course she was good at reading people too.</p><p>"Partly. Let's just say that I have remembered a few more memories from the 'old times'." At this Setsuna quirked an eyebrow, but before she could make any sort of reply Usagi continued, "I must ask that you leave her alone for now. Yes I have an agenda of my own and no, I wont tell you what it is, at least not yet anyway."</p><p>Setsuna was a little taken by the way Usagi held herself at the present moment. Lately she was acting more and more like the princess she really was, as well it seemed that more of her memories of the Silver Millennium were resurfacing. Knowing this, Setsuna complied with her wishes.</p><p>After Usagi left, Setsuna canceled any other appointments she had. Sitting back in her chair, she looked out the window while pondering what Ranko had to do with her princess back in the Silver Millennium. Was she family? No, Setsuna knew every person even remotely related to the royal family. Was she a senshi? No, they were all accounted for... weren't they? This moment she came to a sudden realization.</p><p>'As far as I know the only gaps in my memory have to do with the Gold Millennium Empire, or that boy Ranma. The connection to Ranma is obvious, But that must mean that he too, must have some connection to the Silver Millennium if Serenity-hime has any memories of her. The real question is do either of them have anything to do with the Gold Millennium?" She rested her head in her hands in frustration for a moment before continuing her thought process, 'Damn amazon memory locking techniques! Well, when all else fails, consult the Time Gate.' she thought to herself. At this she left to drive home and then to make way to the artifact in question, so that she may finally receive some answers.</p><b>-02-09-</b><p>As she walked down the hall, Usagi though about the events as of late, and came to a decision. Taking the steps up to the roof, she searched for a certain redhead clad in bandages. It wasn't all that hard. After all, her very presence scared the crud out of almost everyone that was unfortunate enough to be in the same room with her. She was so much like Usagi had remembered <i>Him</i>.</p><p>Gently, yet with great command, she stepped onto the roof and faced the girl in question. Upon locking eyes, or rather 'eye' as is the other girls case, she knew exactly what she hard to do.</p><p>With a smile as bright as the sun and tone of voice that was disarming and kind, she spoke, "Hello again, Ranma. Do you still want to be friends?"</p><b>-02-10-</b><p>"!" Minako couldn't contain her poorly veiled mirth any longer.</p><p>"Sure, yuck it up you blond ditz." Makoto, on the other hand could barely contain her poorly veiled rage. After all, no one would appreciate being so intimately introduced to the binding of a dictionary.</p><p>"Hey, I wasn't snicker the one who didn't duck muted giggle when a large, hardbound book came flying at my face. I'm sorry Mako-chan, but it was just too funny. snicker giggle Bwaaahahahahaahha! You looked like someone from one those anime. HahahahhahaOh,thathurtshahahahahah," Minako at this point, was clutching her sides and was no longer capable of coherent speech.</p><p>"What's so funny Minako?" Usagi asked as she rejoined the group at their usual spot under a large cherry tree. Sometimes Usagi wondered if the people who built this school knew who she was and that her and her friends would be attending. The placement, size, and shape of the tree and the area around it felt almost like a throne or some other place of importance. On top of that the student body seemed to have some sort of sixth sense because the instant they walked over to this spot anyone sitting there would move, without any need of request or persuasion. 'Must be Setsuna's doing somehow,' the Senshi of the Moon would often muse.</p><p>Ami spoke up first as Makoto was still grumbling and Minako continued to remain in the stupor of unladylike merriment at the expense of her rough-n-tough friend, "Minako was just reminiscing the dictionary incident from earlier."</p><p>Minako finally calmed down enough to compose herself. As she began to speak, she brushed a few tears away while still giggling slightly, "I'm truly sorry, Mako-chan. I didn't mean to laugh at you. It's just, I never knew that an expression like that was physically possible."</p><p>Makoto grudgingly spoke. "Well, I guess I accept your apology. But I still can't believe it. How can a person, who is unconscious, not only catch almost everything thrown at her, but duck the one thing she didn't?"</p><p>"Who did that and when?" Usagi asked the sincerely, obviously having been asleep herself during said event.</p><p>They sat there waiting, a slight wind blew by carring a leaf past them.</p><p>"Um, Rei, isn't this the point where you usually jump in and yell at Usagi, calling her 'meatball head' and all sorts of other things?" Ami supplied helpfully while she glanced over to the miko, as the other four members of 'the Royal Court of Lunch Time': Mamoru, Haruka, Michiru, and Hotaru where walking up.</p><p>"Mamo-chan!" The only collage student amongst them suddenly found their princess attached to his side.</p><p>The adorable scene was cut short however, when the priestess of flame screamed out in frustration. "I don't understand it! It's impossible. How can anyone's ki flow backwards like that without any effort! I mean, Ranko was asleep and there was absolutely no change in power level or control. Aargh!" This, of course, caused her fellow senshi to stare at her nevously.</p><p>Reluctantly taking herself away from her beloved, Usagi spoke in a soft, commanding voice. "As of now there will be no more discussion or worries about Ranko until our meeting tonight, as there are to many questions and neither I nor any others with answers feel like repeating ourselves. And before you ask; yes, this does have something to do with the 'good old times' and the scroll." Everyone caught the emphasis on the times phrase and knew instantly why they couldn't talk out in the open about such a topic. And then she continued. "Now, does anyone have any extra food,... I kinda forgot my bento while running out the door this morning." With that all present, excluding the meatball headed speaker, face faulted in total exasperation.</p><b>-02-11-</b><p>Ms. Daihoshi watched silently from one of the third story windows. Down below the Senshi and their future Queen continued through their lunch in a slightly more subdued fashion. Her eyes spoke of wisdom and memory of the ages.</p><p>'And now the final player has gathered... Did it really have to come down to this, Setsuna? The coming storm will not be at all a pleasent one. but then, when has there ever been a pleasent storm? Please forgive me, Ranma my love,' she thought as she turned toward her next class.</p><b>-02-12-</b><p>After school, a familiar girl departed from the premises. Home, however, was not her destination this time. Walking down a few blocks, she came upon a manor. As she stepped up to the gate, it open just enough to let her in and then closed behind her. The door to the building itself opened by way of a Butler, but she paid no mind. Finally stopping her brisk pace in the main foire, she knelled before a tall, dark man that seemed bathed in shadow despite the brilliant light all about him. He was clad in a light breastplate, bracers, and shin guards. Beneath the armor he wore a plain, black pair of pants and shirt. A mask of ebon hue adorned his face. His hair, darker then blackest pitch, was all the way down past his waist and placed in a heavy braid. When he spoke, it was like silk in a thunder storm.</p><p>"What have you to report?"</p><p>"All the players are in place. They don't suspect a thing. However, there is a new variable. One Ranko Saotome, M'lord."</p><p>"Indeed. Keep a close watch on her, but otherwise carry on as planned."</p><p>"Yes, Lord Susano-o."</p><p>"You are dismissed, Lady Charon."</p><b>-02-13-</b><p>Most times she enjoyed the spot light. It was always fun to run them in circles with her riddles and half truths. This was not one of those times. Setsuna, for the first time since accepting the mantle of Pluto, was without any insight. Without an answer to her own riddles. For the first time she knew what it felt like to be in the dark.</p><p>So here she was, sitting at a scout meeting with questions and very little else.</p><p>"So, have you remembered anything else, Setsuna?" Michiru asked simply.</p><p>All Setsuna could do was sigh, she didn't really want to tell them. "...Yes."</p><p>"Well?" Haruka huffed while thinking to herself, 'Can't she ever give us a straight answer?'</p><p>"I am now able to read the entire scroll." Saying this, Setsuna pulled out the scroll from subspace and unrolled it. "The first few lines describe the place I sent Hotaru and Ami last week."</p><p>"Hey Ami, was the person you found Ranko Saotome?" Rei inquired, looking over to the blue haired genius.</p><p>After giving Ami a reassuring look, Hotaru spoke, "Yes. After we found Ranko, we took her to her home, and then to the hospital."</p><p>"You wouldn't know anything about why her ki is running in reverse, would you?"</p><p>"Well, all I understood was that if it didn't she would be dead." After shrugging her shoulders, Hotaru looked to Ami.</p><p>After Ami gave a tired sigh, she opened up her mercury computer and typed a few things in and then after closing it again placed it on the table. A moment later a holographic display faded into existence. The 3d image of a nude female form appeared before all present. It was simple, white in color and possessed very little detail; but it was female none the less. After a moment a small red glow, almost like an orb of some sort appeared in the center of the form. The orb began to grow and change shape, filling the various extremities until the entire 'body' was full. Finally the glow radiated out from the form; bright, but not enough to block out the 'female' from view.</p><p>"As you already know Rei, this is what is known as an aura. Normally, when a person is harmed in some way energy consolidates to assist in the healing process." Ami paused in her explanatino as a large 'cut' appears on the 'girl's' arm.</p><p>After a moment the 'aura' around the wound glowed brighter until the cut was no longer visible. when the glow subsided no damage remained and Ami continued, "However, when the body receives to much damage the aura cannot compensate. The energy leaks out, rather then consolidates." The 'body' is suddenly assaulted by various wounds that would classify as lethal, at which point the red glow flows out of the form. Afterwords the form dims to an almost black, denoting that the 'girl' is 'dead'.</p><p>"I already know that. What does this have to do with Ranko? And since when could your computer create holograms?" the priestess of flame asked, more than a little confused about both points.</p><p>"As far as the hologram is concerned, I discovered that my computer could do that last week. It has been quite helpful with studying our various battles as well as organizing the multitude of files on it. However, getting back to Ranko…," Ami 'pressed' a small icon that was floating beside the figure's foot. "This is a scan I did of her injuries last week," as she was speaking, the figure shifted and molded into a three dimensional image of Ranko. Though not detailing her more womanly parts, the image did show every single wound she had sustained the week before. "This was before Hotaru attempted to heal her."</p><p>"Attempted?" Michiru quirked an eye brow.</p><p>"Yes, attempted. It seems that when Ranko sustained these injuries she used a revised form of an ancient martial arts technique that she learned from the amazon elder Cologne; the Soul of Ice. While doing so, she had accidently discovered another technqiue that had been long forgotten save by a select few. The original purpose of the technique has been lost due to the fact that no one had ever mastered it. Even what she did do with it would not have been possible under normal circumstances. Acording to Cologne, the Soul of Ice was a by-product, a side-effect of the failed attemts. This discovery had a second side-effect. It inabled them to create the Hiryu Shoten Ha, one of Ranma Saotome's most powerful techniques."</p><p>Rei interupted, "Was this the same Cologne that I met at the Nekohaten last week?"</p><p>"Yes." said Ami.</p><p>Seeing another peice to the puzzle that had been plauging her as of late, Setsuna realized something was very off about the last statement that Ami had made. Calming herself as not to let the stress she was feeling enter her voice, she inquired carefully, "I was under the impression that the Amazons didn't teach outsiders their techniques. How did Ranma go about learning it?"</p><p>Ami gave Setsuna a nod of confermation, "You are correct, the Chinese Amazons do not reveal their secrets to any outsider. Just how Ranma fits into this, I can't say. As I told you before, I promised Ranma. And this was something he told me. If the elder had told me of their conection with each other, I would not have such quams." Ami paused for a moment, "Back to Ranko. The technique that she had mastered allowed her to hold her life force in staisis."</p><p>"What do you mean, Ami?" Luna wasn't sure, but she had a feeling where this was going.</p><p>Ami took a deep breath and gathered her thoughts, everyone knew from her actions that the next few statements would have to be made without interruption. "Ranko bound her aura, her life force to every one of the cells in her body." To illustrate her point the hologram shimmered again with an aura, this time blue in color, and once again the aura begins to spill out of Ranko's tortured form much like it did in the other example. However, this time instead out draining entirely, the last bit of energy forms into a net that starts to tighten around the young girl's form until it almost appears as if her skin were tinted with a sapphire sheen. "Normally the body cannot take that level of concentrated power; however, in Ranko's case, she was near death and had very little life force left. So instead of deep frying her insides, Ranko was able to hold everything together. In short, the technique she used stopped the flow of life within her, almost like stopping time. This gave her body the stability it needed to begin the healing process."</p><p>Rei studied the image for a moment when she noticed something not right about the picture in front of her. "Ami, one of the techniques that I employ in my meditations is like this, but it's not lethal in the slightest. How is this any different?"</p><p>Ami reached forward to press the "button" again. Suddenly the image zoomed in until they all could see each individual cell. Those that knew what to look for in an aura, found that Ranko's didn't pulse like a normal aura. Rather it just shimmered lightly, like glass or ice."The difference is in the execution. Unlike your technique, which just requires you to reign in your 'ki' Ranko is holding her aura completely still. Your aura is still moving, while hers has stopped. And that is why Hotaru can't truly heal Ranko without the possibility of doing irreparable damage."</p><p>Michiru's eyes widen in understanding. "Oh I see. Since her aura is not moving, the energy of Hotaru's healing ability can not interact properly. The lack of movement keeps the body from dieing out right, but by the same token, keep any outside interaction from getting in."</p><p>"Precisely." Ami smiled to herself, happy that at least someone got it.</p><p>Usagi spoke up, getting everyone back on track, "What else does the Scroll say, Setsuna?"</p><p>"The next portion refers to the attack tonight. The time and the place, but not who or what. The time of the attack will be at 9:35 pm at the same spot where Ranko fell. The part after that mention a location in China were I found...," the Senshi of Time fell silent. The other Senshi waited as she reached into subspace and pulled out The Hilt. Setting it on the table, she steeled herself for the most important part. Ami began analyzing it, as the other Senshi looked on.</p><p>"Setsuna, where did you get this?" Ami could not believe the readings she was getting. "This blade is..."</p><p>"The final sword of the Gold Millennium Empire. Yugure No Shinzo, 'The Heart of Dakness'."</p><p>The other Senshi sat patiently as Ami and Setsuna continued their duologue.</p><p>"The Gold Millennium Empire?"</p><p>"It was before The Silver Millennium. All record of it's history was completely wiped out by the order of the first Queen. I saw to the cleansing myself. Even my own memories where sealed away. It is my most darkest and shameful secret."</p><p>Seeing the pain in Setsuna's eyes and her body was begining to shiver in fear, Usagi moved to comfort her by putting arm around her and holding her close. "It is alright. If you don't want to tell us, then you don't have to." The other Senshi were more than a little shocked to see the unflapable Pluto shake like a leaf. It was almost surreal.</p><p>For the first time in her life, Setsuna let herself be comforted. "Even if I wanted to tell you, I don't remember it all yet. Right now, all I remember is that the sword belongs to a demon that was born of the power of Sol and Nemesis and should have been sealed away for all eternity. And that it is somehow my fault for it's escape..."</p><p>Rei looked at her shaken comrade with a determined expression adoring her face. "What was it called? Maybe while you guys prepare for the battle, I can do a fire reading?"</p><p>"It's name is Dark Star."</p><b>-Preview of Chapter 03-</b><p>The end of the beginning and the beginning of the end.<br/>A new kind of youma appears, but this time they are looking for blood.<br/>During the battle with the youma, the senshi encounter a strange, soft spoken warrior.<br/>But is this cloaked individual friend... or foe?</p><p><b><i>Next Chapter:</i><p><i>"Shrouded Sun Arising"</i></p></b></p>
