</div>"I'm waiting!" Mara said, hostility dripping from her voice.<br/>"Divine wish," Urd gasped out. Mara blinked for a moment and the grip on Urd's throat loosened as Mara transferred her hand to the collar of Urd's robes.<br/>"What did you say?" Mara asked, eyes narrowed. "Are you trying to tell me that MY daughter received a divine wish? And she wished to roll in the hay with you? I didn't think goddess's were supposed to lie, Urd. That is the worst lie I've ever heard."<br/>"Kodachi didn't make the wish, Mara," Urd said. "She's part of it."<br/>"And this wish requires you to teach her magic so she can fuck you as a guy?" Mara growled.<br/>"That was her idea," Urd said trying to maintain her cool. "We're supposed to get married. Heh..." Mara blinked and shook her head out at that.<br/>"WHAT WAS THE WISH, URD!" she demanded angrily.<br/>"The wish says that she, myself, and five other people are supposed to be happily married to each other," Urd said simply. Mara blinked and pulled away from Urd.<br/>"What five other people?" Mara asked, leaning herself against a wall.<br/>"Damn, Mara," Urd said dusting herself off. "Again?"<br/>"What five other people?" Mara asked. Urd sighed and decided to start with the two males first.<br/>"Ranma Saotome," Urd said and saw Mara wince. "Ryouga Saotome, Ukyou Kuonji, Akane Tendo, and Shampoo daughter of Silk." With each name Mara winced again.<br/>"You're facing the furies, and two second class demons," Mara said glummly leaning against the wall and staring down at the sidewalk.<br/>"I had a run in with them already," Urd said. "That cat sort of pushed the issue on Shampoo and Ranma a little quicker than I wanted."<br/>"Aitvaras needs to make Ranma the greatest martial artist of this time period," Mara said. "Ays needs to give Ryouga his desire for vengeance against Saotome. Megaera needs to help Ukyou settle with the Saotomes in some manner. Alecto needs to marry Ranma to one of the Tendo girls. Tisiphone was supposed to get Shampoo a strong husband, and she did that technically, and sounds like completely from what you tell me. She just needs to ruin Shampoo's life now that the wish is fulfilled."<br/>"Not quite," Urd said, as Mara just outright turned over this information. She had guessed some of it already from her mini-self's encounter last night, but Mara had just filled in the blanks. "Shampoo consummated the marriage with Ranma in the wrong gender, so she has a strong wife by her people's laws now." Mara looked up and nodded with a sort of irritable smirk.<br/>"I'm on assignment already, so you don'y have to worry about me," Mara said. "Unless they outright order me to interfere. And I'd rather not have another kid haranguing me through the centuries if at all possible."<br/>"You could interfere if you wanted to, Mara," Urd said. Mara looked at her as if she were crazy.<br/>"Do you know what would happen to...me if I tried?" Mara asked. "And don't even bother giving me that 'forgiveness is eternal' crap. Keep the kid away from me, Urd." Mara spoke grimmly and then she leaped back and vanished in a puff of smoke.<br/>"How long is she going to let them do this to her before she gets a clue," Urd wondered.<br/>It was perfectly easy for her to understand the true forgiving nature of heaven above. She herself had been a demon and then been accepted back as a goddess. Her understanding of the demonic frame of thinking might have been broader than most gods, but it was still very limited.<br/>She shook her head and looked for the nearest television.<p>*******<p>"Hey, Akane," Ukyou said, turning to the other girl. "Akane, I'm talking to you."<br/>Akane was still very reluctant to look at her, but eventually did, relaxing as no daydreams were created by seeing Ukyou's face. Ukyou looked confused at the behavior<br/>"What is with you these last two days?" Ukyou asked.<br/>"Umm, Ukyou," Akane said. "Do you mind if I call you Ucchan?" Ukyou blinked and her head shot back in confusion. Talking to Urd yesterday had gotten her thinking, and last night she'd had a dream that started like that.<br/>~Where did that come from?~ Ukyou wondered, absently mirroring Akane's thoughts as the other girl began to suddenly look very embarrassed. Ukyou noted the growing blush and felt one of her own starting.<br/>"It's just that, you're my friend," Akane said suddenly. "That's all...that's all."<br/>"Uhh, sure," Ukyou said hesitantly. "I...guess that would be alright."<br/>"Thanks," Akane said, suddenly feeling much better for some reason. "So what did you want?"<br/>"Where's Ranma," she asked. "I want to talk to him too."<br/>"I don't know where the baka is," Akane said in her normal mix of worry and anger. "He never came back home last night."<br/>"You and he had a fight again," Ukyou said, not asking a question. "Look, just, well we need to talk about the new fiancee so let's meet after school at my place. Okay?"<br/>"Yeah," Akane said. "Sure. Will Konatsu be there?"<br/>"No, Sugar," Ukyou said. "He goes off and trains every four days or so."<br/>"Oh," Akane said conversationally. "So it will just be us then?"<br/>"Unless we see Ranma or one of the others before we get there," Ukyou said. Akane nodded in understanding and then noticed the door about to open to let in the teacher.<br/>"It's a date," she said, noticing Ukyou blush brightly in response. Akane blinked and winced before turning back to face forward, turning bright red. ~Damn it, I KNOW she cast a spell on me. I can't get the image of Ukyou out of my head now. Arrrggghhh! Maybe she didn't notice.~<br/>Of course, said spell had already worn out so that not even a small bit of it was left. Still, as long as Akane was convinced the spell was there she had an excuse for her thoughts.<br/>~Oh my goodness!~ Ukyou thought, staring straight ahead and trying to fight down her blush. ~She's coming on to me. Akane's coming on to me! What do I do? Ummm, stay calm. Probably my imagination anyway.~<br/>Both girls glanced surreptitiously toward the other, and then bolted their eyes to the front as they made eye contact.<br/>~Definitely not my imagination,~ Ukyou thought desparately. ~Well, I'll just have to tidy up my room before she...errr...let her down easy...that's right.~<br/>~She noticed,~ Akane thought to herself. ~Okay, I'll just have to apologize for being so forward...I mean tell her I'm not myself.~<br/>They concentrated on the lesson for a couple of seconds.<br/>~My room is a total mess,~ Ukyou whined internally. ~How the hell am I going to get it clean before she gets up there?~<br/>~A little forward is good,~ Akane reasoned. ~Ukyou likes a little forward. Just not Tsubasa forward.~ One of the remaining mini-Urds sat in the rafters and giggled madly as she rubbed her hands.<p>*******<p>"Where the?" Ryouga panted wearily as she discovered herself standing in front of her house. "How'd I get here?"<br/>She looked around confused and then shrugged, scratching her head in confusion. Then she lugged her heavy feet into the building, dragging her pack and umbrella behind her. Since she was here, she might as well get some hot water.<br/>She walked into the building and noticed that there were some backpacks in the hallway next she set hers.<br/>"Mom and Dad are home," she said, surprised, and then looked down at herself and acquired a very worried expression.<br/>She cautiously peeked into the main room and looked around before beginning her quest for the kitchen. It had been cleaned since the last time she had been there, but the only thing she saw out of the ordinary was the creepy little doll on the sofa. The one that seemed to be alive and watching her.<br/>She tip-toed in the room, trying to guess where her parents might be. Being caught in an unfamiliar body by her parents was not a good idea. They tended to fight first and ask questions much later, quite unreasonable in her opinion, really.<br/>Ryouga had no idea how completely hypocritical that statement was.<br/>No one was in the main room. So now all she had to do was get to the kitchen or bathroom before anyone noticed her. She reasoned that she had at least a twenty percent chance of hitting ONE of those rooms. The odds were good.<br/>Ryouga didn't notice the "doll" standing up and following her silently and curiously. By some miracle she managed to make it to the kitchen on her first try. She glanced in and looked toward the bulk of the kitchen, which included the sink.<br/>Seeing nobody, she smiled and tip toed on her way to the sink, not noticing the rather surprised woman in the small end of the kitchen behind him. Aki froze in mid gesture of raising her cup of tea to her lips. Though the gesture was quickly resumed.<br/>The fact that she was drinking tea probably saved Ryouga from a great deal of panicky running and trying to explain things verbally. Aki loved her tea. She hated to break off from her tea. She was perfectly content to let this potential assassin do whatever it was she came do while she finished said cup of tea.<br/>In fact, once she and Jiro had been caught in a war on one of the other worlds they had travelled to simply because she had heard that there was this truly wonderful teas made by this one person on the world. This would sound like a mere bad timing coincidence if one didn't know that Jiro and Aki had been to the world before.<br/>There week on the world had resembled the introductory scene of "Saving Private Ryan." All because they had ruined some mega-powerful sorceress's dinner on their arrival. It would be too soon if Aki and Jiro never heard the term "dragon cuisine" ever again.<br/>They had collected some lost artifact for Hermes, or was it Gabriel that time? Anyway, upon returning, in more or less one piece, they had both sworn that they would never even say the world's name ever again.<br/>About twenty minutes later Kishijoten had asked Aki if she had tried those teas.<br/>The tea she was drinking was one of that particular blend. She had about twenty packages left and planned to make them last for quite a while. If she went too soon Jiro might balk about going back to get more from the nice dragon. She only wished she could make it as well as Filia could.<br/>At the moment she was quietly celebrating her son's engagement, and thinking of interesting ways to kill this silly intruder in her home. Then she would finish the kettle. She dearly loved her tea. And this was the best tea that she had found yet.<br/>Meanwhile, Ryouga had turned on the hot water tap and stuck her hand under it, waiting for the water temperature to increase. It happened to hit just the right point as his mother was taking another sip of tea.<br/>Aki spat the tea out in shock upon seeing the intruder become her son. The remainder of the cup spilled over the floor, and the kettle itself was knocked violently to the side upon contact with her elbow.<br/>Has it been mentioned that Aki loved her tea?<br/>"Mom? Urk!" Ryouga gasped turning around to see his mother staring at him wide-eyed, not yet aware of the waste of her tea. Ryouga on the other hand was quite aware and had lost his capability to speak.<br/>"Ryouga you...you..." Aki pointed to the sink and her son with the cup. Her eyes were suddenly focused on that cup. "MY TEA!"<br/>"What's-?" Jiro paled as he saw the situation. Rakshasha possessed of a berserker rage that they used in battle to greatly enhance their physical power. But...Aki loved her tea. "Oh no! Aki calm down! He just got here, we have to tell him the news!"<br/>"MY TEA!" Aki growled, human illusion vanishing. The mini-Urd was impressed and nervous.<br/>"It's not working dad," Ryouga said in a tiny voice and getting ready to run.<br/>He just knew what was coming next. Well he didn't for sure. Some task certainly, but he wasn't certain quite what yet. He just hoped that this time it had nothing to do with shrubberies and herring.<br/>"Look, I'll..." he paused. "We'll pick you up another box next week, okay?" Aki's rage vanished in a flash and she turned to her husband with a cutely smiling face.<br/>"Really?" Aki asked. Jiro had lost most of his skin tone as he resigned himself to the suicide mission later and nodded. She turned back to a relieved Ryouga and scowled. "RYOUGA! Dishes! Now!"<br/>"Hai, mother," Ryouga said, meek and relieved. No impossible task for him this time it seemed. He immediately started to work on the dishes. "You'll probably wondering why I was a girl, aren't you?"<br/>"We'll get to that after a moment," Aki said dismissively. "Ryouga Hibiki, I'd like to introduce you to one of your fiancees." She indicated the mini-Goddess that had been there guest the past couple of days. Ryouga turned around slowly and looked at the doll curiously.<br/>"I'm engaged to a doll?" Ryouga asked, confused.<br/>"Hmph," mini-Urd said. "If you think I'm a doll now, what did you think of my full bodied self when I met you the other day?" Ryouga looked closely at the talking doll, and refrained from freaking out.<br/>"Y..y..you're that goddess," he said surprised.<br/>"Part of her, yep," she said. "Main real self is sort of entertaining one of your other soon to be spouses."<br/>"What?" Ryouga asked, confused and mind threatening to cease function.<br/>"Urd came to announce her intention to include you in part of a multiple marriage," Jiro explained. "We approved the situation." He sided up to Ryouga and elbowed him with a wink. "A goddess and five women out for you, eh? Reminds me of..." he noticed Aki's look. "Err...congratulations son."<br/>"Uh...what five women?" Ryouga asked.<br/>"Prepare yourself for a shock, you know them all," mini-Urd said smirking. "Shampoo, Akane, Ukyou, Kodachi and Ranma."<br/>Ryouga responded in the manner of an Amazon male as demonstrated by Shampoo earlier in that day.<br/>He fainted.<p>*******<p>"She's awake," Shampoo heard Ranma say.<br/>"He's awake," Cologne corrected. "Ranma, I know it will take a while for you to get used to the idea, but as far as Amazons are concerned, Shampoo is your husband. In the presence of other Amazons you should treat him as such. As well as avoiding that form as much as possible."<br/>"The only other Amazons out here are you and Mousse," Ranma said. Shampoo sat up and saw that he was definitely in male form. "So I don't have to worry about it. And I wouldn't either way."<br/>"Tell me, Ranma," Cologne said. "Do you wish to return to China?"<br/>"Not any time soon?" Ranma said firmly. "If at all."<br/>"Then you will need to face a challenge to begin a new village," Cologne said. "Or the elders will come en masse to force you and all your betrothed's back to Joketsuzoku." Ranma seemed to consider that. "Even you couldn't fight them all off."<br/>"Aiya," Shampoo said, noticing she was back in female form and dressed. She hoped Ranma had done that. "Is bad dream, yes?"<br/>"Aren't you one to talk?" Ranma asked, snapping at Shampoo. "You started this junk." Shampoo winced.<br/>"Despite her use of certain pressure points in ways that violated the center point of all our laws," Cologne said sharply, causing Shampoo to wince even further. "Shampoo might not be entirely at fault."<br/>"What do you mean?" Ranma asked. "I already said I jabbed her after she jabbed me." ~And then she jabbed me.~ He flushed slightly but managed to keep the reaction down.<br/>"I was not talking about you daughter-in-law," Cologne said. She reached behind her and retrieved a scroll to present to Shampoo. "This is a letter from your mother to me, Shampoo."<br/>"But, Shampoo mother is dead," Shampoo said, surprised. "It come from before grandmother go crazy?"<br/>"No," Cologne said. In the rafters above a mini-Urd listened carefully. "Judging by the contents, your mother wrote this while she was in heaven." The mini-Urd fell off the rafter and smacked into the table below.<br/>"I know I should have checked that thing before she put it in the case," the mini-Urd muttered. Shampoo and Ranma gathered around the mildly concussed mini-Urd and stared at her in mild astonishment.<br/>"Strange white-hair woman get very small," Shampoo said.<br/>"This is my new fiancee?" Ranma asked. "An oompa-lumpa?" The response was a mini-Urd bolt to his face.<br/>"Oompa lumpa!" Urd said, mildly astonished. "For your information I am just one part of your newest finacee, Ranma Saotome. Since Silk seems to have told the old woman everything, anyway, I should tell you that I am the Second-Class Goddess Urd, one of the three Norns. I'm certain mother-in-law can explain everything else."<br/>"Actually," Cologne said. "Silk told me that you were a valkyrie sorceress. I had no idea that you were a goddess." The mini-Urd facefaulted.<br/>"If you DIDN'T know that I'm here because of Nodoka Saotome's divine wish," mini-Urd asked. "Why'd you assume there were demons involved?"<br/>"Uhh...this is my Mom's fault?" Ranma asked.<br/>"Because she apparently learned that all of the mortals on that list were the center point of one demonic wish or another," Cologne said. Everybody stared at Cologne in unveiled shock.<br/>"They're the targets of a demonic wish?" mini-Urd said sheepishly.<br/>"Targets?" Ranma and Shampoo said together.<br/>"Did everyone BUT me know about that?" Urd asked from the doorway. The mini-Urd blinked and then hopped over to her prime self and vanished into the goddess. All present goggled.<br/>"May I start by saying that the only thing I could do to correct Aitvaras's work was to give Shampoo a little attack of conscious?" Urd asked.<br/>"Ranma," Cologne said, after finally gaining her voice. "This is your fiancee, don't you have something to do?"<br/>"What do you me..." Ranma grumbled. "You're kidding right?"<br/>"I'm afraid not," Cologne said. "The fact that you have other ties will not be accepted by the council. They either all become Amazons or they die. Granted a goddess is beyond even THEIR reach, but you might as well get used to it."<br/>"Have her do it," Ranma said, pointing at Shampoo.<br/>"What was that?" Urd asked.<br/>"HE," Cologne said, eliciting a wince from Shampoo. "Is not given the right to accept new members into the household, you are."<br/>"Fine," Ranma said and stood up reluctantly to approach Urd. A bucket of water changed Ranma to what Cologne now considered HER proper form, a fact for which she received a glare from her daughter in-law.<br/>"Do it right," Cologne said.<br/>"Look there are some important matters to go over before we get to the fun stuff..." Urd said before Ranma glomped Urd.<br/>"Wo ai ni," she said sort of off-handedly before kissing her.<br/>Urd, of course for her part was not about to let someone kiss her as if it were a chore, and proceeded to, as a matter of pride, give Ranma the full benefit of her skill.<br/>Ranma's eyes popped wide as Urd responded and her hands started to roam. After a few shocked moments she began kissing in earnest, vainly trying to match the situation.<br/>The situation might have continued, and was already attracting Shampoo, but Cologne had decided that the proper forms had been made and interrupted it by smacking her daughter-in-law on the head.<br/>"Oww!" Ranma said, backing off. "What was that for?" As she asked, Cologne was likewise bonking Shampoo.<br/>"You were not invited, Shampoo," Cologne said. "Just because your wives might give you leeway does not mean I shall."<br/>"Shampoo getting tired of being man," Shampoo said. It was a very funny statement coming from her in girl form.<br/>"As Urd said," Cologne reminded them.<br/>"There is the demon business to discuss," Urd finished.<p>*******<p>Genma smiled as he walked out of the city office. It had been remarkably easy to get the boy's girl form registered as a separate person. Knowing nothing of the ultimate force, Genma alloted it to his own skill for pulling a scam. Whatever the case, Ranko Saotome was now an official person.<br/>"Now he can marry Akane and Ukyou and the family honor will be appeased," Genma said happily. "Too bad he can't have a third identity. Then he could marry that boy Kuno too, and get all that money."<br/>Genma walked along for a moment apparently deep in thought.<br/>"Now all I have to do is find Kuno," Genma said. "I'm certain he'll go wild over the chance to marry his beloved pig-tailed girl. He'll probably even pay me up front! And then Ranma can marry Akane and still earn me all those millions of yen."<br/>Just where Ukyou had vanished to in Genma's mind is probably something better left unimagined.<p>*******<p>"So, ummm," Akane said. "Not open for business?"<br/>"Not today," Ukyou said. "I have to run inventory one day out of the week and Monday's usually the best time. So we...uhmm...won't be interrupted...talking."<br/>"Right, talking," Akane said. "About the new fiancee and how she wants to marry all of us."<br/>"Yeah, her," Ukyou said, her eyes floated to her stairs for a moment. "Excuse me Akane, I have to...tidy up a little, I'll be right back." She was off almost in a blink." Akane set her jug down and took a breath.<br/>"I think I scared her," Akane said. "I'll tell her when she gets back down, I didn't really mean to..." She blinked and caught her reflection in Ukyou's spotless grill. "Ahh! I forgot to shower after gym, I've got to stink."<br/>Megaera watched invisibly and considered the situation. Her charge and Saotome's reluctant fiancee alone together in Ukyou's house. Lots of blushing and nervous dancing around words. Ukyou tidying up her room, and Akane primping. She smirked as a new thought occured to her.<br/>She did wonder where Akane had gotten the nannichuan though. It was like there were gallons of the stuff floating around or something. Shampoo had had it, Akane had it. Where was it all coming from? Wasn't Jusenkyo thousands of miles away? Wasn't the nannichuan destroyed? Where in Hell was the stuff coming from? It was EVERYWHERE!<br/>Anyway, stealing Ranma's love was certainly away to 'settle' with the Saotomes. Alecto could just marry Ranma to one of the other Tendos anyway. She just had to make certain that Akane discovered she had been used and take out appropriate vengeance on Ukyou.<br/>"Great," mini-Urd whispered, skittering along the walls. "Megaera, what's she doing here? Is she assigned to ruin this wish?" She watched the demon walk upstairs, obviously to influence Ukyou somehow.<br/>The mini-Urd floated up behind Akane and whispered insistently. The sound of a thump from upstairs gave her a quick idea.<br/>"Ucchan needs you!" she said. Akane, who had been in the process of opening her jug of water, gasped and rushed upstairs. The mini-Urd followed cautiously, and was greeted by the sight of a second fury.<br/>"There are three Tendo daughters Alecto," Megaera said irritably. "After Akane sullies herself Soun will insist one of the other two take over the engagement."<br/>"You don't understand!" Alecto growled. "I've been setting this up for a long time, he is dead set on Akane, it'll take forever to get him to change his mind."<br/>"You should have kept your options opened, little sister," Megaera said. "I've got my job finished here. As soon as I make sure that Ukyou has the right mindset."<br/>"Over my dead body, Megaera," Alecto growled starting to power up.<br/>"Fine I'll come back and plant the suggestion after the fact then," Megaera said. "Let's settle this outside, sister!" The mini-Urd sweatdropped as the two demons vanished to begin their little duel.<br/>"Ucchan!" Akane said. "Are you all right?"<br/>"Akane!" Ukyou said desparately as she crawled out from under a pile of dirty linen that had apparently buried her. "You weren't supposed to come up here yet...it's err...a little messy. I keep the towels from the restaurant up here."<br/>"Ohh," Akane said, relieved. "That's fine, I thought someone had kidnapped you or something." Ukyou snickered.<br/>"We've been around Ranma too long," Ukyou said. "That actually sounds plausible."<br/>"Yeah," Akane said.<br/>They were both quiet for a moment and fidgetted, looking around the room.<br/>"So...ummm...," Akane started nervously, "about this woman that wants to marry us all...She told Dad something about two identities, so two people could share him I guess."<br/>She quietly poured herself a small glass of water out of her jug. Ukyou sighed and stepped up to stand in Akane's face and look at her nervously.<br/>"Let's save that for when Ranma's around later," Ukyou said, blushing. "You didn't...really...come to...uh...talk...did you?" The last sounded uncertain and Ukyou turned away momentarily.<br/>"I didn't mean to..." Akane sighed and looked over Ukyou and glancing away embarrassed. "No I guess not..." She took the cup of water and quickly splashed herself in the face and rubbed it into her skin in case this was a daydream.<br/>"I...guess that I didn't bring you to talk either," Ukyou said quietly she turned around and caught sight of Akane splashing herself and growing several inches. "A...Akane?"<br/>"Why are my panties..." Akane paused at the changing of voice. "...crushing me?"<br/>She looked down and noticed her change. Most noticeably the pain as her clothes weren't designed for such a body. That was something the daydream had lacked.<br/>"AHHH!" Akane flailed back in a near random direction, sending the jug flying into, predictably, Ukyou.<br/>Being in a boys uniform didn't help Ukyou much, the change still caused a painful confrontation between his body and certain underneath wear. He had to snap his chest bindings quickly or they would have crushed his ribs before breaking.<br/>Compared to the discomfort from his panties, however, that was nothing. He and Akane both tried to relieve themselves of those constricting garments quickly. Akane had an easier time, once overcoming shock, as he was wearing a dress. Ukyou had to drop his pants first.<br/>"Where the hell did the nannichuan come from?" Ukyou demanded.<br/>"I...I...It was outside the dojo," Akane said.<br/>"Maybe a trap?" Ukyou growled. "Shampoo?"<br/>"Urk, not a good thing," the mini-Urd thought. She floated up to Akane's ear, still invisible. "If she brought it she left it by accident, it was outside the wall, any vagrant could have picked it up all night." This mini-Urd hadn't actually seen the situation, but could guess well enough. Fortunately, a guess wasn't lying.<br/>"I don't think so," Akane said. "It was left outside where anybody going by could have taken it or thrown it away or whatever."<br/>"Shit," Ukyou said, trying slip on his pants again. ~This ruins the mood.~ "I'll get us some hot water." He felt both relieved and disappointed.<br/>"Do you want to let this chance past?" the mini-Urd asked Akane. "Say something before the mood completely dies."<br/>"Umm, I uh, don't need any yet," Akane said. Ukyou stopped and stared at Akane in surprise. So did the mini-Urd, she hadn't quite expected that. "Errr...depending on you anyway...uh...Ucchan."<br/>"Wh...wh...wh...what do you mean?" a furiously blushing Ukyou asked.<br/>"Remember yesterday in the bathroom," Akane said.<br/>"You were sort of looking at me..." Ukyou said. "Uhh...Akane, you were...umm...thinking about me then weren't you?"<br/>"You, me and...uh...some nannichuan," Akane admitted, flashing occasional glances at Ukyou. "And...uh..."<br/>"Go for it," the mini-Urd said. "You're on a roll." Akane took a deep breath and strode up to Ukyou and added in a gentle tone, stroking his cheek.<br/>"I'd just like to prove to you that you are a woman," he said, remembering something of the line he had used before.<br/>"Oh kay," Ukyou said shakily.<br/>Then Akane hesitantly leaned in to kiss Ukyou. It wasn't as skillful as Urd's kiss certainly, but in a lot of ways it was just as good for both of them. And then they broke apart for a moment. All the while the mini-Urd was cheering them all intangibly present.<br/>"Are you sure we need any hot water?" Ukyou asked after a moment.<br/>"One fantasy at time," Akane said blushing. "And how would that prove you're a woman?"<br/>"Right Akane," said smirking nervously as he reluctantly left to get his water. "Maybe we'll save this for when there's a redhead to sandwich, eh?" The joke was nervous, but came through mostly strong as Ukyou left.<br/>Akane smiled at the thought.<br/>"Now about those demons that might come back," Urd thought.<p>*******<p>"Hello?" Jiro answered the phone. "Who is this? Urd? Well, you are you here, yes, sort of?"<br/>"What do you mean I have to marry Ranma?" Ryouga's voice demanded as he and his mother and the mini-Urd discussed his engagement.<br/>"No just a mini-you," Jiro said. "Errr...We're not really...uh...equipped to handle a...uh...two first-class demons. Well, maybe we can distract them for a while."<br/>"I will not marry that jerk!" Ryouga declared. "He's ruined my life! I hate him! I don't care about your wish or whatever!"<br/>"It's not everyday that a goddess asks for your hand in marriage, Ryouga," Aki said. "And this Ranma Saotome is well talked of among the valkyries and einherjar, umm...him?"<br/>"Well, that's your choice," the mini-Urd said. "But if you really hated him, heaven wouldn't have allowed this particular wish to go through. Somewhere you have care a little for him."<br/>"Him?" Aki said again, a little more insistantly.<br/>"Excuse me," Jiro said interrupting. "But another of Urd's mini's wants us to...umm...distract a couple of FIRST CLASS demons from either interrupting or corrupting two of your spouses' first time together..."<br/>"Ehhh?"<br/>"What?" Urd said. "TWO demons, what kind of fire power are they sending against this one wish? Who are the couple?" Again, she hadn't yet been given the information her prime self had.<br/>"I think she said Ukyou and Akane," Jiro said.<br/>"HIM!" Aki demanded.<br/>"Yeah Mom, Ranma's a guy!" Ryouga said. "Wait...demons...Ukyou and...Akane?" Ryouga's nose threatened to overwhelm him.<br/>"Ranma's a man and a girl," mini-Urd said. "Like your son here."<br/>"Ohh," Aki said. "That's all right then."<br/>"MOM!" Ryouga roared, temporarily forgetting the other thing.<br/>"What?" Aki asked, then she blinked. "Did you say FIRST CLASS demons?" Jiro nodded. Aki turned to the mini-Urd angrily.<br/>"WHO DO YOU THINK WE ARE?" she demanded. "HIMURA KENSHIN?"<br/>"Honey, its a manga," Jiro said. "He's NOT real, not like we are." ~I'M supposed to be the berserker, sheesh.~<br/>"And I'm not the one asking!" mini-Urd said. "I am...errr...the other I am!"<br/>"Oh come on," Ryouga said. "Akane's in danger!" And with that Ryouga started to run out the door, until Jiro caught him.<br/>"We'll teleport," Jiro said. He turned to the mini-Urd "You gave me the address."<br/>"I'LL teleport!" Aki said. "You can't target places, only beings."<br/>"Just hurry!" Ryouga said.<br/>"And don't interrupt Akane and Ucchan!" mini-Urd said. This nearly incapcitated Ryouga.
