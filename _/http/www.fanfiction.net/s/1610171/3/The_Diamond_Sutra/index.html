</div><p><b>The Diamond Sutra  - A  Ranma 1/2 Fanfic  </b>By Ashoka Roque<br/>All warnings, etc.  see Chapter One</p><p>C &amp; C  appreciated</p><p><b>Chapter  Three: </b></p><p>As the  softball game began, the announcer reviewed the starting line-up for both teams  over the PA system, then concluded:</p><p><i>.the victor  of this match between cross-town rivals 'Furinkan Tsunami'<br/>and 'Hodakai Shiba Inus' will gain the title of all-city Girl's softball<br/>champion,  winning the chance to go up  against the visiting American<br/>club 'Sapho Sluggers' later this month..."</i></p><p>"We'll  kick their butts," said Ukyo, swinging her bat menacingly, "After  mastering okonomiyaki-style martial arts, I can hit that ball a kilometer any  time I want to."</p><p>Akane  punched her glove violently. <i>Stupid Ranma.   He should be here to cheer on me and Ukyo.  Instead, he's out for a carefree drive in the mountains.</i></p><p>With a  sickening lurch, the car came to a stop, front end down at a sharp angle, as  the engine died.</p><p>Both boys  sat still for a minute.  The only sound  was the radio, where John, Paul, George and Ringo where finishing their  time-capsule performance.</p><p>After a  while, Ranma said, "Are you okay, Ryouga-kun?"</p><p>"I  guess. How about you?"</p><p>"Fine,  I think. Let's try and start the engine."</p><p>Ryouga  nodded.  Before turning the key, he  violently snapped the radio to the 'off' position.  The car turned over once, then died. But the rotary engine caught  on the second try.</p><p>"Well,  that's something, at least," said Ranma. "Let's try to back up."</p><p>Ryouga  grunted, then put the car into reverse. Gently, he eased his right foot off the  clutch as he pressed the accelerator with his left. A grinding noise came from  the front end, but the car didn't move.</p><p>"Shit-shit-shit!"  cried Ryouga, banging his head with his fist. "I can't believe I'm so  stupid."</p><p>Ranma looked  a Ryouga with concern.  This was usually  the point when Ryouga became disgusted with himself and ran away. If he did,  he'd be lost again for who knows how long.</p><p>Ranma's  worries were right on the mark. <i>I can't handle this,</i> thought  Ryouga.  <i>I just need to get out of  here.  All I do is screw things up for  myself and everyone around me.  I  thought I was such a big shot - impressing Ranma with my driving. I'm totally  worthless.</i></p><p>But this  time, another voice spoke in Ryouga's head. <i>If you leave, Ranma is stranded  here. Besides, didn't you think his offer to work as a team was a good idea?  How can you be on a team if you always run away? </i> Breathing heavily, Ryouga tried to hold his emotions in.</p><p><i>Man, he's  really shaking,</i>  thought Ranma. Ryouga actually looked as if  he wanted to cry.  <i>He was so adorable  when he was driving - so confident and cocky! But if anything, he's even more  attractive now when he's vulnerable. I could just grab him, pull him close...</i></p><p><i>No! </i>Ranma concluded, sharply, <i>I've given  him enough reasons to be suspicious.    He's only now starting to trust me.   If we could even just stay friends, like we've been today, it would be  better.  I don't have the right to want  anything more.</i></p><p>"Hmm,  Ryouga-kun?" said Ranma, "Let's get out and take a look at the car,  okay?"</p><p>When the  boys had carefully exited the tilting vehicle, they saw that the front of the  car was in the shallow end of a water-filled gully.  Mud was splattered around.</p><p>"This  is a front wheel drive," said Ryouga. "Maybe the tires just can't get  any traction.  I'll go in and see if I  can push it back a bit."</p><p>"You  can't do that, Ryouga-kun," said Ranma, shaking his head.</p><p>"Why  not?"</p><p>"Because  I can't drive a stick-shift, and neither can P-chan."</p><p>"Oh -  right," said Ryouga, "I see what you mean."</p><p>"I'll  get in front and push," suggested Ranma. "You can pull from the  back."</p><p>"Okay,  I'll pop the trunk so I can get a grip on something and pull. And,  Ranma-kun?"</p><p>"Yes?"  said Ranma, peering at the gully with distaste.  The water would be cold, and he was not looking forward to going  in.</p><p>"I'm  sorry.  This was my fault for not paying  attention."</p><p>"Don't  worry," said Ranma, laughing a little, "I was about to say the same  thing. I wasn't watching the road very well, was I?"</p><p>With that,  Ranma dipped in to the waist-deep - and very cold - water.</p><p>The change  from male to female was slightly less uncomfortable than usual.  It was always less of a shock when Ranma  knew it was coming, and very cold water seemed to, well, numb things up. Even  so, the feeling that part of him was being ripped up by the roots still brought  on a silent sob.  He knew in his mind  that everything was still there, just tucked away, but that wasn't much  comfort. As always, it was mercifully quick.</p><p>"Are  you ready, Ryouga?" Ranma's voice, half an octave higher than a moment  before, called out, "One, two, three..."</p><p>After about  twenty minutes, the boy and the girl had gotten Dr. Tofu's car out of the  gully.  Ranma use a bucket from the  car's trunk and some clean water from upstream to rinse off most of the soft  mud.  Fortunately, it looked as if the  car was none the worse for wear.</p><p>The sun was  getting lower, and was only strong enough to get Ranma partly dry.  She sat in the car and hopped she didn't get  the seat too damp. The two drove the final few kilometers to their destination  in silence - with no hint of radio.</p><p>Ranma and  Ryouga reached Himura-san's shop just before closing.  The mechanic, a man in his mid-sixties with only as few remaining  strands of graying, greasy hair, eyed the couple with a leering grin as he took  the car keys.</p><p>"Sooo...Ono-kun  has the pair of you staying at his dad's cabin, eh?"</p><p>It took a  few moments for it to register that "Ono-kun" must be Dr. Tofu. <i>I  didn't even know he had a first name!</i> thought Ranma.</p><p>"Uh,  yes," said Ryouga, "We will be back to pick up the car  tomorrow."</p><p>"It  should be ready by noon," said Himura, actually looking at the car for the  first time. "Hmm, better make that 2 pm - looks like his front-end  alignment is out pretty badly. Funny, he hadn't mentioned that."</p><p>A single  large bead of sweat formed on the back of Ryouga's head- a xerox copy formed on  Ranma's.</p><p>"Anyway,"  continued Himura, "I'm sure you two will find plenty to keep you busy  until then, hey?"  Poking Ryouga  in the side with his elbow, he held up his right hand with his pinky extended,  and gave a leering wink in Ranma's direction.</p><p>Dr. Tofu's  instructions said that the cabin was a three-kilometer hike up the mountain  road, nothing the two martial artists couldn't easily handle. The pair started  off, a change of clothes for tomorrow stowed safely in Ryouga's backpack. The  road was fairly well used, so the two travelers stuck to the shoulder.</p><p>About  halfway to the cabin, Ryouga stopped,   "Uh, Ranma-kun, I really need to go!"</p><p><i>Why in the  hell is he going to run away now? </i>thought Ranma, <i>Oh, wait...he's gotta pee</i>.</p><p>This seemed  to be a pretty good guess, as Ryouga was bouncing lightly, yet somewhat  frantically, on the balls of his feet. And Ranma could see that his need had given  him a noticeable erection, which was outlined in his drawstring pants. Ranma  turned her head away, flushed.</p><p>"Well,  go already," she said, testily,   "Do you need my permission?"</p><p>"But I  can't" said Ryouga, "The road's too busy.  I'd have to go off into the bushes. You gotta come with me."</p><p>Ranma  paused. If she went into the bushes with Ryouga in this state, she'd be tempted  to look - or, Ryouga might accuse her of looking. Either way, it was just too  likely to turn into an incident...</p><p>"Look,  I'm a girl right now - I can't go rushing off into the bushes to watch you pee!  Just go, do your thing, and call me when you're done.  I'll come get you."</p><p>"Why do  you have to be so difficult?" cried Ryouga, grabbing his crotch tightly  with his left hand.</p><p>"JUST  GO!" screamed Ranma, turning her head away while she still had the power  to do so.</p><p><i>Baka Ranma!</i> thought Ryouga, as he dashed into the  thicket, <i>Why's she's being so stubborn?</i></p><p>After  walking a few meters into the bushes - enough distance to place a good screen  between himself and any passing cars- Ryouga wrestled his stiff penis out of  his pants and unclenched his groin muscles, allowing the pent-up pressure to  finally be released.</p><p><i>I mean, it's  not as if Ranma hasn't seen it before,</i> thought Ryouga.  But as  the urgency of his distress abated, blood that had been temporarily re-assigned  to his crotch rushed back into his brain, and nudged a receptive neuron.</p><p><i>Oh... this  is about the other day. When I accused Ranma of looking at me in the bath.  Well, it's true! </i>Ryouga thought defensively. <i>But I guess  that explains why Ranma is acting so weird. Man, I really opened my mouth that  time.</i></p><p>Adjusting  his pants, Ryouga was just about to call Ranma's name, but stopped  himself.  <i>Hell, I only walked like,  maybe ten steps into the thicket.  I can  get back to the road without Ranma's help.   I'll show her I didn't need her anyway!   </i></p><p>Ryouga took  three steps before falling into the stream.   The change to P-chan was almost instantaneous, but Ryouga still had time  to feel the sickening shrinking sensation, and the nauseating feeling of  disorientation as human senses of sight, hearing, and smell changed to those of  a pig.  But, unlike Ranma, Ryouga also  felt the utter panic of losing part of his mind, as the brain of a pig was  simply not capable of supporting the higher thought processes of a human being.</p><p>After  waiting for several minutes, Ranma began to fidget. "Ryouga! What's taking  you so damn long. You...uh...didn't have to do more than pee, right? 'Cause if  you actually asked me to follow you out into the woods to watch you take a  dump, you're in for some serious trouble when you get back!"</p><p>After a few  more minutes, Ranma became more concerned.   "Ryouga!  I'm coming in to  get you.  Let me know if you aren't  done, okay?"</p><p>Ranma took  only a few steps into the brush before she realized what had happened to  Ryouga. There was P-chan, shivering next to Ryouga's backpack and umbrella on  the bank of the cold stream.</p><p>"P-..uh..Ryouga,  come on, I'll lead you out."</p><p>While  Ryouga's mind was still his own, it was hampered by the physical limitations of  P-chan's body. Upon seeing Ranma-chan, his first reaction was panic. <i>She's  come to kill me this time!  This was all  a trap, just to get me out here.  If  something happens now, no one will ever know! </i> P-chan's heartbeat increased, as the typical Ryouga flight  response started to kick in.</p><p>Ranma saw  the pig's distress. "Hey, don't be scared of me," she said, in her  softest girl voice.  <i>Man, he really  is helpless as P-chan! No wonder he always clings to Akane when he's like this.  </i> "Ryouga...P-chan - I won't  hurt you. We're a team now, remember?"</p><p>Ryouga's  psyche wrestled for control of P-chan's body, finally calming it down and  allowing Ranma to pick him up.</p><p>"There  we go!" said Ranma, scratching P-chan under the chin. "We'll get you  into a hot bath in no time."  Ranma  picked up Ryouga's things and started to head toward the road.</p><p>Just as she  was about to leave the thicket, an unpleasant reality occurred to Ranma.  <i>Damn - now <b>I </b>gotta pee!</i></p><p>Akane  gathered her equipment from the dug-out.   Though there had been a few close moments, there had never been any  doubt that Furinkan High would take the girls' softball championship.</p><p><i>Especially  with Ukyo on our team, </i>thought  Akane. <i>After handling that giant spatula for so long, she's a natural heavy  hitter.</i></p><p>Looking up  from her duffle bag, she saw Ukyo leave a group of their team-mates. "Go  on ahead - I'll catch up with you in a little while."  Ukyo turned, then, noticing Akane, walked  back to the dugout.  "Need a hand  with anything?"</p><p>"Uh..  no Ukyo-chan, I'm fine. Congratulations, by the way. That home run you hit  really won the game for us."</p><p>"Thank  you, Akane-chan.  But don't forget that  triple play you made in the fifth inning. That's when I knew there was no way  we could lose."</p><p>The two  girls looked at each other for a moment. Ukyo started to say something, then  hesitated.</p><p>"Anything  wrong, Ukyo-chan?" asked Akane.</p><p>"Oh...not  at all. I'm a little tired, maybe," replied Ukyo, face slightly flushed.  "But not too tired to celebrate this evening!  Let's go get cleaned up."</p><p>On their way  back down to the locker room, Akane felt another familiar wave of resentment  wash over her. <i>That Ranma.  He's been  Ukyo's friend since they were children, yet he missed her big day. And, knowing  him, he probably has that nice Ryouga boy involved in some type of mischief.</i></p><p>Ranma-chan  and P-chan arrived at the Tofu family cabin just as the last rays of the sun  faded from the western sky.  The first  order of business was to get everyone back to normal.  Ranma slipped her shoes off at the door, put Ryouga's things on  the table and began her search for the tub.</p><p>"Wow!"  cried Ranma, as she stepped out onto the deck that ran behind the cabin.  The porch was built to take advantage of the  stunning mountainside view.  At the edge  of the deck was a Swedish style hot spa.   Ranma removed the top from the tub and saw that the water was clear, and  slightly warm. "I don't know how much Tofu-sensei pays that caretaker, but  he definitely deserves a raise!"</p><p>"Kwee!"</p><p>Looking down  at P-chan, Ranma smiled. "Just a minute, buddy, you'll be yourself again  in no time."  After playing with  the spa controls for a few minutes, Ranma set the temperature and timer so that  the water would be nice and warm.   "Even a modern spa like this will take a while to heat up.  Let's go look around."</p><p>The cabin  was small, and built in the exotic style of a European ski cottage. The main  room had a leather sofa and two large chairs. The hardwood floor was partially  covered by a sheepskin rug, which rested directly in front of the central  fireplace.  Belatedly realizing that  they had forgotten to pick up food, Ranma rummaged through the kitchen.</p><p>"Well,  Ryouga buddy, looks like we can have whatever we want to eat as long as it's  Cup Ramen -at least there's plenty of that stored away -ah! Juyondai!"  Ranma picked up the bottle of sake. "Well, Tofu-san did say help  ourselves. Perhaps dinner won't be a total loss, after all!"</p><p>Ranma drew  tap water into two Cup Ramen and set them in the microwave to cook. In a couple  of minutes, Ranma was able to set one cup of steaming noodles on the floor for  P-chan, while she a happily slurped her own serving.</p><p>After  starting a fire in the large stone fireplace, Ranma was back on the deck -  P-chan under her left arm, bottle of sake in her right hand. Ranma placed the  sake in a foam floater at the edge of the hot tub, then lifted up P-chan and  set him on the side of the spa.</p><p>"You're  clean enough to jump in now, and I'm sure you don't want to stay a pig any  longer than you have to.  I need to wash  up before I get in, though. You just jump in when you're ready, and I'll be out  in a while."  Ranma looked up at  the last fading threads of twilight. "It will be dark by the time I get  out, so you won't have to worry about your privacy if we share the tub."</p><p>As soon as  Ranma went into the cabin, P-chan dove into the water.</p><p><i>Damn, she  sure has gotten self-conscious,</i> thought Ryouga, when the last piggy cobwebs had cleared from his  brain. <i>It's not like I ever said Ranma <b>couldn't</b> look at me, just that  I noticed he had been.</i> But even Ryouga realized that sounded pretty  lame.  He took off his dirty bandana and  wrung it out over the edge of the tub, finally draping it over the balcony  ledge to dry.  He settled in a corner of  the spa, just his head and shoulders above the waterline, to wait for Ranma.</p><p>Ranma  cleaned up in the bathroom shower. The hot water seemed to shrink her breasts  like melting ice, while his testicles and penis emerged like a snail from its  shell, and his entire body grew more muscular and angular. <i>It's disgustingly  compelling - almost like picking off a big scab, </i>he thought, once the  transformation was completed and the discomfort had subsided.</p><p>Ranma  emerged from the house, one towel wrapped around his waist and several others  draped over his arm. These he placed on a deck chair beside the spa.  Unwrapping himself, he stepped into the hot  tub, at the opposite corner as far away from Ryouga as possible.</p><p>"Feeling  better, Ryouga-kun?"</p><p>"I'll  say," said Ryouga, smiling, "Yourself?"</p><p>"Much  better. Feeling - - myself again, I guess."</p><p>"Do you  think that sake is warm enough, Ranma-kun?"</p><p>"Well, we'll  just have to taste it and see."</p><p>There really  is nothing like a nice, warm sake while soaking in a hot tub at the end of a  long and eventful day.  Both boys soon  felt themselves relax, as sore muscles began to unwind, releasing hours of  stored tension.</p><p>"Hey,"  said Ryouga, "That sake <i>is</i> good, kinda sweet."</p><p>"I  think I'll have some more - here, pass me your cup."</p><p>While  neither Ranma nor Ryouga was a sake virgin, one couldn't say either of them was  an experienced drinker, either.  By the  second cup, both were feeling quite light-headed.</p><p>Ryouga moved  to a corner of the tub that looked out over the edge of the balcony.  He turned around and rested him arms on the  edge of the spa, so that he could look at the breathtaking view, well lit by a  full moon.  Ranma took up a similar  position in the adjacent corner.</p><p>Though it  was unseasonably chill up in the mountains, the water was warm, and steamed  slightly in the thin air. Ryouga's body above the waterline was cool, and the  occasional wisps of mist rising from the tub made him shiver just a little when  they brushed against his skin.  But the  sake warmed him on the inside, while the water warmed most of him on the  outside, so it wasn't at all a bad feeling.</p><p>Ranma looked  up at the autumn constellations, and recited:</p><p><i>When fall  leaves turn gold<br/>Moon and bright stars move closer<br/>Diamonds shine above!</i></p><p><i>Yeah, they  do look like diamonds, tonight, for sure,</i> thought Ryouga. It reminded him of the letter from Ti-Sensei,  about being strong, but showing your hidden feelings.</p><p>Ryouga  turned his head, to look at the boy sitting next to him as they both leaned  against the edge of the tub. "That's a beautiful haiku, Ranma-kun. Where  did you learn that?"</p><p>"Uh,  well," said Ranma, scratching the back of his head with his hand, "I  wrote it myself...for a class."</p><p>Ryouga made  a decision. <i>I am trusting you on this, Ti-sensei.</i></p><p>"You  know, Ranma-kun, about the other day...well... I know you look at me  because...because I look at you, too."   Ryouga guessed this was true - he hadn't really thought about it until a  few moments before. Whether is was actually true or not, it felt like the right  thing to say, and Ryouga wanted to say it, realizing where this might lead.  "In the bath, I mean..."</p><p>"I know  what you meant," replied Ranma, quietly.</p><p>"I'm looking  at you now," said Ryouga, even more quietly, his voice slightly husky.</p><p>"That's  the sake talking."</p><p>"Hmm -  and if I get a nosebleed, I guess it's just because of the altitude, huh?"</p><p>Ranma turned  to look at Ryouga, who had moved closer to him with this last statement.  "Hibiki Ryouga, I wish I could believe you were serious."</p><p>Ryouga  reached under the water, and took Ranma's hand.</p><p>"Saotome  Ranma, I've never been more serious."</p><p>Diamond  Sutra concludes in Chapter Four: Resolutions<b></b></p><p><b><i>C&amp;C  Welcome - </i></b></p>
