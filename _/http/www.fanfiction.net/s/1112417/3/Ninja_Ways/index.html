</div>Chapter Three: The Ninjas Of The Hidden Leaf Village<p>'" "' will be used when Ranma and Naruto are speaking to each other.<br/>Ranma opened his eyes slowly. He looked around and realized that he was moving.<p>'Naruto must be awake already,' Ranma thought to himself when he heard someone else talking.<p>"Hey! You sure you want to look like that?" A man asked.<p>"Yeah, yeah! Just do it!" Naruto yelled.<p>'Do what?' Ranma thought when he saw a flash go off in his eyes. 'What the hell?'<p>Naruto stood posing with face paint all over his face. Soon after Ranma stared at his new ninja certificate. He stared at it with a blank face.<p>'"What the hell is this?"' Ranma yelled.<p>'"What? I spent a long time thinking of a suitable pose!"' Naruto yelled back.<p>'"Sigh. this is too stupid."' Ranma muttered.<p>'"Shut up!"' Naruto yelled.<p>'"Whatever. So what are we doing now?"' Ranma asked between yawns.<p>'"We have to show this to the Third Hokage,"' Naruto answered.<p>'"Whatever, I'm going back to sleep. I'm tired right now. probably used up too much energy. just because I haven't used a body in a decade."' Ranma muttered as he fell asleep.<p>Naruto just stood there, then made his way to the third Hokage. Naruto handed his certificate to the Third and sat down across from him. The Third just stared at Naruto's picture.<p>"It took me forever to come up with a good look! Yeah, but. It's pretty artistic isn't it?" Naruto yelled brashly.<p>"Retake it," The Third muttered loud enough for Naruto to hear. "And where's your head plate?"<p>"I'm saving it for tomorrow's ceremony. I don't want to damage it," Naruto answered.<p>"Naruto, this Ninja Registration book lists all those in the village with high ability. This should be an important document to you, yet. what's with this face?" the Third yelled.<p>"Well, I don't understand stuff like that!" Naruto yelled back.<p>Suddenly the door slid open slightly. Naruto perked up when a little boy shot out from behind the door.<p>"Old man! Fight me!" he shouted.<p>Another man ran into the room.<p>"Oh! Not again!" he shouted.<p>Naruto just watched with a blank stare. The boy suddenly tripped over his scarf and plummeted to the ground. Naruto watched the boy yell out in anger.<p>'Who's this kid.?' Naruto wondered.<p>That was when the kid ran up to Naruto.<p>"I know! You did something!" the boy yelled.<p>"You just tripped on your own, you idiot!" Naruto yelled back.<p>"Hey, Naruto! Let go of him! That's the Third Hokage-sama's grandson!" the man that had followed the boy yelled.<p>Naruto just looked at the man and then back at the boy.<p>"Go ahead and punch me!" the boy yelled.<p>Naruto felt a vein pop in his forehead. He smacked the boy right over the head with his fist.<p>"You think I give a damn, moron?" Naruto yelled.<p>Naruto let go of the kid and walked out of the room. He walked away but quickly noticed the boy following him. Naruto's eye began to twitch. He turned around and yelled.<p>"Stop following me!"<p>Naruto stared blankly as the boy came out of his hiding place. He just stared as the boy appointed Naruto as his boss. Naruto just watched as the boy begged to learn the Sexy no Jutsu. That was when Ranma woke up.<p>'"Will you shut the kid up and do what he asks?"' Ranma yelled.<p>'"I was going to teach him!"' Naruto yelled back.<p>'"Fine."' Ranma muttered, then fell back asleep.<p>3 hours of training later<p>Naruto and Konohomaru, the boy, sat on a log.<p>"By the way, why are you going after your grandpa?" Naruto asked.<p>Naruto listened to Konohomaru talk about his name and why he wanted the Hokage name. Naruto just stared at him then began to talk.<p>"Who would acknowledge a punk like you? Hokage, Hokage. If you want the name that much then. Then kick my ass!" Naruto yelled as he stared straight into Konohomaru's eyes.<p>That was when Konohomaru's instructor, Ebisu, showed up. He glared straight at Naruto. Naruto flinched. Ranma immediately woke up sensing Naruto's state.<p>'Shit. those eyes again. Why does everyone.' Naruto thought to himself.<p>Ranma stared at Ebisu's eyes and shook. He hadn't seen such cold eyes in a long time.<p>'To have to endure this.' Ranma thought when Ebisu jumped down.<p>Naruto and Ranma watched as Ebisu tried to convince Konohomaru of training when Konohomaru transformed.<p>"Sexy no Jutsu!"<p>Konohomaru transformed into a beautiful naked lady, but being young, couldn't hold it for very long. Ebisu just dropped his jaw, and then yelled. Naruto and Ranma watched as Ebisu yelled about how vulgar it was. Naruto and Ranma smiled as they both began to think along the same lines.<p>"Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!" Naruto yelled.<p>Multiple shadow clones came out of nowhere and lined up against Ebisu. Ebisu smiled and got ready. The Naruto clones merely held up their hands to perform the next seal in his plan.<p>"Transform!" the Naruto's shouted as they all began to transform.<p>All the clones turned into naked clones of Ranma's female form and attached themselves to Ebisu. Ebisu just stood there, blood trickling down his nose. Finally his nose exploded as he shot backwards, blood shooting from his nose. Konohomaru gasped as he watched as the clones began to disappear. Naruto stood there in the clearing with his hands crossed.<p>"I call that one Harem no Jutsu!" Naruto yelled.<p>Suddenly Naruto began to lecture to Konohomaru on the basis of the Hokage name.<p>"This is the Hokage name, the name of the greatest ninja in the Village. If you want a name like that, you better prepare yourself. If you want everyone to acknowledge you." Naruto started as he began to walk away, "There ain't gonna be any shortcuts."<p>Konohomaru just stared, and then turned around as well.<p>"I'm not letting you be my boss anymore! From now on. we're rivals!" Konohomaru yelled.<p>Naruto smiled.<p>"Well, I begin my ninja training starting tomorrow but one day I'll fight you for the Hokage name. I'll be looking forward to it. Konohomaru," Naruto said.<p>Konohomaru just stared in awe as Naruto walked away. Ranma just sat down and stared into space.<p>'"So what was all that about?"' Ranma asked.<p>'"Nothing really, just making sure he doesn't fool around like I did."' Naruto muttered.<p>'"Oh, well then, why don't we get in a little training of our own before tomorrow's class?"' Ranma asked.<p>'"YEA!"' Naruto yelled.<p>Naruto walked off deeper into the forest where no one could see what they were doing. Naruto continued practicing his Kage Bunshin technique. He also practiced his basic ninja skills. Ranma took over the body when Naruto began to tire out. Ranma did a little training as well, trying to test out the limits of his body. Soon enough they returned to Naruto's house and fell asleep, completely exhausted.<p>*****<p>Naruto yawned as he woke up. Ranma rubbed his eyes inside of the body and sat on the floor. Naruto went about his morning rituals and got ready to go to his new class. He placed his head protector on his head and smiled. He quickly made his way to class and sat down, grinning. A kid tapped him on the shoulder.<p>"Hey Naruto! What the hell are you doing here? Only people that passed are allowed here," the ked asked.<p>"Hey, hey! Can't you see this forehead protector?" Naruto stated pointing to his forehead protector.<p>That was when another voice interrupted. Naruto immediately blushed. Ranma raised his eyebrow but said nothing.<p>'Sakura Chan!' Naruto thought happily. 'Could it be that she wants to sit next to me.?'<p>"Naruto! Move your ass! I want to sit on the other side of you!" Sakura yelled pointing at Uchiha Sasuke.<p>Naruto recoiled, then moved. Ranma just slapped his head then turned his attention to the boy Sakura was now sitting next to. His eyes widened.<p>'Shit. if I didn't see him right now I would have never known he was there.' Ranma muttered. 'I better keep my senses tuned better. can't do it as well without taking control of my body.'<p>Naruto was thinking other things.<p>'Argh! I hate this bastard more than anyone!' Naruto thought. 'What's so good about him?'<p>Naruto got up and then plopped himself right in front of Sasuke. The two glared at each other. Ranma sighed. That was when Naruto suddenly felt something push him from behind. He fell forward, planting his lips right on Sasuke's. The two just sat there with their eyes wide open then separated immediately.<p>"Argh! My mouth is rotting!" Naruto yelled.<p>Suddenly Naruto felt a dark presence behind him. He began to shiver, as it grew larger. He slowly turned around to see Sakura pounding her fist into her other hand. Moments later Naruto sat on his chair completely beat up and bruised. Ranma slapped his hand to his head then noticed a feeling near him. He noticed a surge of chakra flow past him. After watching and experiencing Naruto's chakra he was able to identify it quickly, however this wasn't Naruto's regular chakra. It was something else and it was healing Naruto up at an incredible rate. Ranma's eyes opened.<p>'Is this. is this the power of the nine-tails?' Ranma mused silently when Iruka stepped up to center stage.<p>"Today we will be creating 3 man teams. Each team will be accompanied by a jounin sensei. You will follow your sensei's directions as you accomplish your missions," Iruka stated.<p>'Three man teams? That will be interesting. I might be able to see what other skills these ninjas can accomplish.' Ranma thought to himself.<p>'Sakura. than anyone but Sasuke.'Naruto thought to himself.<p>"And team 7 will consist of. Haruno Sakura, Uzumaki Naruto, and Uchiha Sasuke," Iruka announced.<p>Naruto immediately got up to protest when he suddenly stopped. He sat down. Iruka just stared at Naruto then continued on his list. Everyone else just stared at Naruto.<p>'"Don't make a scene, moron!"' Ranma shouted internally.<p>'"Argh! I can't stand Sasuke!"' Naruto groaned to Ranma.<p>'"Hey, maybe you can learn something from him. You know, you aren't that good."' Ranma muttered.<p>"Shut up!" Naruto shouted.<p>He didn't realize that he had just yelled out loud. Iruka stared at Naruto again. Sasuke just smirked.<p>"Why don't you shut up, dead last," Sasuke muttered.<p>Naruto felt a vein pop in his forehead. He completely ignored Ranma and started to yell at Sasuke who completely ignored him. Ranma sighed and sat down. It was going to be one heck of an interesting life.<p>"Hey! Settle down now. You can all go take a break now. You'll meet you're jounin sensei after the break," Iruka announced sighing.<p>Everyone left to get their lunches. Sasuke went off by himself but he quickly noticed that Naruto was following him. Sasuke smirked.<p>'What the hell is he trying to do?' Sasuke thought when all traces of Naruto disappeared.<p>Sasuke's eyes widened. He turned around looking around for Naruto. He was nowhere.<p>'What the hell? I was sure he was.'<p>Ranma smirked as he sat up in the tree. Umisen-ken had been a complete success. Naruto was laughing his ass off inside.<p>'"Hey now, that guy isn't so bad,"' Ranma said to Naruto.<p>'"He is!"' Naruto yelled back.<p>'"Whatever."' Ranma muttered.<p>He decided to have a little bit more fun when his stomach suddenly turned upside down and inside out. Ranma lurched forward then ran off to the bathroom. Sasuke noticed Ranma jump out of the tree and run off holding his stomach.<p>'When did he get in that tree? Shit, he's not as crappy as I thought.' Sasuke mused.<p>Sasuke continued on his way when he saw Sakura sitting on a bench staring off into space with a blush on her face. He wrinkled his brow and tried to ignore her.<p>'Stupid girl. she's no ninja,' Sasuke thought to himself when Sakura finally noticed him.<p>"Ah! Sasuke!" Sakura squealed.<p>Sasuke just stared at her with a cold gaze. Sakura froze momentarily then shook it off.<p>"It's time to go," Sasuke stated plainly. "Where's Naruto?"<p>"Huh? Who cares about Naruto? All he does is get into fights with you. Well he didn't have a normal childhood. He doesn't have any parents," Sakura started to rattle off.<p>Sasuke froze and looked at Sakura.<p>"He can do whatever he wants. If I acted like him my parents would get so mad," Sakura continued.<p>Now Sasuke was glaring at Sakura.<p>"He's so lucky, all alone, parents never getting on his case. That's why he misbehaves so much," Sakura said when Sasuke finally spoke up.<p>"All alone."<p>"Huh?" Sakura asked.<p>"The sadness of having a parent yell at you is nowhere near the sadness he feels," Sasuke stated coldly.<p>"What's this. all of a sudden." Sakura muttered, sweating.<p>"You're. annoying," Sasuke stated firmly.<p>Sakura just stood there unable to respond in any way. Sasuke began to walk away when he noticed Naruto running at him. Naruto, who was now in control, looked up and yelled.<p>"Hey! What are you doing here?"<p>"I'm heading back to class, moron," Sasuke said lightly.<p>"Oh," Naruto stated.<p>Ranma watched Sasuke carefully. There was something that he was hiding. Ranma placed the thought into the back of his mind, with the other hundred thoughts he had stored there. The two of them began heading back. Sakura was standing alone when they met up with her. She waved to the duo. Naruto, now back in control again, waved back happily. Sasuke just nodded his head in acknowledgment. Sakura lowered her head slightly, but both boys missed it. The trio headed back into the classroom. Soon enough the jounins began to enter. Every team met up with their jounin and headed out. Eventually even Iruka left saying that the last jounin would arrive soon. Team 7, consisting of Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke, all sat in the room waiting. Finally Naruto got up and looked out the door.<p>"Damn, why is our sensei so late?" Naruto complained.<p>"Naruto! Sit still!" Sakura scolded.<p>Sasuke just sat with his hands in front of his face.<p>'Naruto. who are you?' Sasuke pondered as he sat there.<p>Naruto, becoming annoyed grabbed an eraser and opened the door a little. He placed the eraser at the top of the door and sat down.<p>"Pft, like a jounin's going to fall for something like that." Sasuke muttered when the door slid open.<p>The eraser fell right on the jounin's head, chalk dust floating everywhere.<p>"HAHAHA, you fell for it!" Naruto yelled laughing.<p>The jounin stared at the trio and then smiled. He placed his hand on his chin and began to talk.<p>"Hmm, how can I say this.? My first impression of you guys. is I hate you guys!"<p>The trio just stared back at the jounin as silence pervaded the room. The jounin motioned for everyone to follow him. He led them all to the roof and sat down on the ledge.<p>"OK, well why don't we start off with introductions?" he asked.<p>"What do you want to know?" Sakura asked.<p>"Well how about you likes and dislikes? Dreams for the future, hobbies, you know, things like that." he answered.<p>"Hey, hey. Why don't you introduce yourself first?" Naruto asked.<p>Ranma also wondered whom he was now dealing with. Sasuke was thinking much the same thing.<p>"Me? Well my name is Hatake Kakashi. I have no desire to tell you guys about my likes or dislikes. Dreams for the future. hmm. well I have lots of hobbies," Kakashi stated.<p>"So all we learned was his name." Sakura whispered blandly to Naruto and Sasuke.<p>"Now it's your turn, from the right," Kakashi said.<p>"Me! My names Uzumaki Naruto! I like cup ramen! I like the ramen at the restaurant that Iruka-sensei takes me to even more! What I dislike is waiting for 3 min for the ramen to cook," Naruto started.<p>Kakashi stared at Naruto.<p>'Does he think of anything besides ramen?' Kakashi wondered when Naruto continued.<p>"My dream is to surpass Hokage! And then have everyone in the village acknowledge my existence!" Naruto proclaimed loudly.<p>Kakashi looked at Naruto with a surprised expression, which turned into a thoughtful look.<p>'He's grown in an interesting way,' Kakashi mused.<p>"My hobbies. pranks I guess." Naruto finished.<p>'I see.' Kakashi thought as he patted his head.<p>He turned at looked at Sasuke.<p>"My name is Uchiha Sasuke. There are tons of things that I dislike but I don't really like anything. And. I don't want to use the word dream but I have an ambition. The resurrection of my clan and. to kill a certain man," Sasuke stated with finality.<p>Sakura just stared at Sasuke with a blush on her face.<p>'Cool.' she thought to herself.<p>Naruto blanched.<p>'He better not mean me.' he thought worriedly.<p>Ranma on the other hand looked at Sasuke thoughtfully.<p>'What on earth has he been through to turn him into this.?' Ranma thought to himself.<p>Kakashi stared at Sasuke.<p>'I thought so.' He mused.<p>"Well, lastly the girl," Kakashi said gesturing at Sakura.<p>"I'm Haruno Sakura. The thing I like is. well the person I like is. umm. should I say my dream for the future? OH MY!" Sakura squealed.<p>Kakashi just sweat dropped.<p>"The thing I dislike. is Naruto," Sakura stated forcefully.<p>Tears began to spring from Naruto's eyes. Kakashi just sighed.<p>'Girls this age are more interested in love than in ninjutsu.'<p>"Well, that's enough of that. We will start our duties tomorrow," Kakashi said.<p>"Duties? What kind of duties?" Naruto asked excitedly.<p>"First we're going to do something with just the four of us," Kakashi said.<p>"What, what?" Naruto asked.<p>"Survival training," Kakashi answered.<p>"Survival training?" Naruto asked.<p>Ranma smiled.<p>'"We'll be able to test how good we are."' Ranma said to Naruto.<p>Naruto smirked. Kakashi noticed this and raised an eyebrow.<p>"Why does our duty training?" Sakura asked. "We did enough of that back at the Academy."<p>"I'm your opponent, but this isn't your normal survival training," Kakashi said lowering his head slightly.<p>"Then, then what is it?" Naruto asked becoming excited.<p>"Hehehe." Kakashi laughed.<p>"What's so funny, sensei?" Sakura asked.<p>The three listened as Kakashi explained the circumstances around the survival training.<p>"Only 9 of the 27 go on as genin? 66% failure rate?" Naruto yelled.<p>'"Hey, don't worry about it. We have an edge."' Ranma said to Naruto.<p>Naruto calmed down slightly. Kakashi explained the rest of the details and then left leaving the three to ponder what to do. Naruto and Ranma went there way soon enough. Sasuke had left right after Kakashi did and Sakura soon followed.<p>'"Naruto, there's no point in stressing over this. We're going to do fine so let's just go and get some sleep. We're going to need all the energy we can gather tomorrow,"' Ranma told Naruto.<p>'"Yea. You're right,"' Naruto agreed.<p>The two fell asleep quickly enough and slept quite soundly. Sakura and Sasuke also fell asleep quite quickly, both realizing that they would need the rest. Morning came soon enough and the trio was at the spot of the test right on time. Sasuke was dressed in his usual clothing, as was Sakura. Naruto wore his traditional black pants and red top that he wore everywhere. His hair was tied back in a ponytail. Sakura looked at the two. Both of them were handsome in their own way, however, Naruto was the biggest idiot in the village and everyone seemed to dislike him for one reason or another. Sakura shrugged her shoulders and looked over to Sasuke. Now there was a perfect man, Sakura thought to herself. The trio waited like this until about 30 minutes later Kakashi strolled into view.<p>"Hey guys!" Kakashi said lazily.<p>"You're late!" Naruto yelled angrily.<p>Ranma just sat down.<p>'Man, that's an annoying habit. reminds me of Ryoga. also late to everything. course P-chan was late by a few weeks.' Ranma thought, laughing a little at the last thought.<p>The group watched Kakashi place a small clock on a tree stump and push the alarm.<p>"Ok, it's set for noon," Kakashi said while taking out two bells. "Here are two bells. You're task is to take them from me before noon. Those who cannot get a bell by noon gets no lunch. I'll not only tie you to one of those stumps but I'll eat right in front of you."<p>Sakura, Sasuke and Naruto's faces all fell at that. Their stomachs began to grumble slightly.<p>"You only need to get one bell. There are only two so one of you will definitely be tied to a stump. And the person that doesn't take a bell fails. So at least one of you will be sent back to the Academy," Kakashi continued.<p>The group all stared at Kakashi hard. Ranma merely continued to listen.<p>"You can even use your shurikens. You won't succeed unless you come at me intending to kill me," Kakashi finished.<p>"But! You'll be in danger!" Sakura yelled out.<p>"Yeah, you're so slow that you can't even dodge a blackboard eraser! We'll kill you!" Naruto shouted brashly.<p>"In the real world, those with no talent often bark the loudest. Well, ignore Mr. Dead Last and start when I say." Kakashi started when Naruto reached down his hand and grabbed one of his kunais.<p>'Pft. can't keep his cool.' Kakashi began to think when Naruto suddenly stopped. 'Well, that was interesting.'<p>Naruto had grabbed his kunai when he suddenly heard Ranma shout at him.<p>'"What the hell do you think you're doing?"' Ranma yelled.<p>'"Shit. I'm gonna kill him!"' Naruto shouted back at Ranma.<p>'"We'll get him so just calm down!"' Ranma shouted causing Naruto to slowly lower his arm.<p>Kakashi raised his eyebrow. He had been ready to stop Naruto but Naruto had stopped completely unnaturally without any outside influence. There was something strange about it but Kakashi pushed that thought to the back of his mind.<p>"Well, looks like Mr. Dead Last isn't quite as reckless as I thought. Well, since you seem so eager to attack. Start!" Kakashi yelled.<p>Sakura and Sasuke immediately jumped off and hid themselves. Naruto, being Naruto stood right where he was. Ranma, knowing no better, did nothing to stop him. The dust from Sakura and Sasuke started to clear and Kakashi looked around.<p>"The basics of a ninja are to hide yourself well," Kakashi said out loud.<p>'Good, they have all hidden themselves well.' Kakashi thought as he sensed his new pupils.<p>That was when Naruto made his presence known.<p>"Come and fight me!" he shouted cockily.<p>Ranma got himself ready mentally; ready to switch at any moment.<p>Kakashi's headband slid off his head slightly.<p>".Umm. you're a little bit off." Kakashi muttered.<p>'What a total moron,' Sasuke thought to himself.<p>"The only thing a bit off is your haircut!" Naruto shouted while running at Kakashi when Kakashi put his hand into his pocket.<p>Naruto immediately stopped and became wary.<p>"Ninja fighting lesson #1. Taijutsu. I'll teach you about it," Kakashi said without looking at Naruto.<p>'Taijutsu is hand to hand combat. yet he's going to use a weapon?' Naruto thought to himself.<p>'"Watch out Naruto. We don't know what he's up to,"' Ranma cautioned.<p>Kakashi proceeded to pull out a book. The title read Come Come Paradise. Naruto stared at Kakashi.<p>"What's wrong? Hurry and come at me," Kakashi said.<p>"But. hey, hey! Why do you have a book?" Naruto asked in confusion.<p>"Why? Well, because I want to read what happens next. Don't worry, it won't make a difference with you guys," Kakashi said starting to read his book.<p>Naruto just stood there for a second then rushed forward in a fury.<p>"I'll beat you to a pulp!" Naruto yelled.<p>'"Hey! Slow down you moron!"' Ranma yelled at Naruto.<p>Naruto, completely ignoring Ranma proceeded to attack Kakashi who blocked all of his attacks with one hand. Naruto jumped back then sped forward with a kick to Kakashi's head, who ducked at the last second. Naruto turned around and threw a punch, only to hit thin air. Naruto just looked around for a second when he heard Sakura yell at him. He looked around at the last second to see Kakashi speeding forward with two of his fingers.<p>"Hidden Leaf Ancient Taijutsu Supreme Technique! A 1000 years of pain!" Kakashi shouted as he poked Naruto in the ass with an obscene amount of force shooting Naruto into the air.<p>Sakura and Sasuke just sat in their hiding places with emotions of disgust. Ranma slapped his forehead and sighed. Naruto fell down into a body of water.<p>'Damn it!' Naruto yelled to himself.<p>He grabbed two shurikens out of his pants and threw them at Kakashi through the water only to watch Kakashi grab them out of the air and twirl them on his fingers, all while laughing at what he was reading. Sakura and Sasuke watched the skill and tensed up. Naruto continued to swear while under water.<p>'Damn it! I can't fail here!' Naruto scolded himself.<p>Ranma watched as the chakra in Naruto's body sped through. Ranma smiled. Things were finally going to get interesting. Kakashi watched as Naruto slowly crawled out of the water.<p>"Hey, what's wrong? If you don't get a bell by noon, no lunch," Kakashi stated.<p>"I know that!" Naruto shouted back.<p>"You sure are weak for someone who's going to surpass Hokage," Kakashi goaded.<p>"Damn, damn. I'm just a little hungry!" Naruto shouted.<p>Sasuke and Sakura listened to their own stomachs grumble a little. Their faces fell a little. Naruto continued to yell.<p>"I was just a little careless!" Naruto shouted.<p>Kakashi began to walk away.<p>"Ever head that carelessness can be your worst enemy?" Kakashi shot behind him.<p>Naruto clenched the ground and stared at Kakashi as he walked away.<p>'I'm going to make him acknowledge me!' Naruto vowed to himself<p>Ranma counted the seconds. Three. two. one. Suddenly eight Naruto shadow clones jumped out of the water.<p>"Hah! My specialty, Kage Bunshin no Jutsu! You better not get careless! There's more than one of me now!" Naruto shouted.<p>Sasuke and Sakura's eyes both widened.<p>'1,2,3. 8? What's this Jutsu?' Sasuke thought to himself.<p>'What? They aren't illusions but all real?' Sakura thought.<p>Kakashi said a few things but Naruto ignored them. He merely rushed forward. Kakashi turned around and stared at them.<p>"With your ability, a minute is probably your limit with this. No matter how many you line up, you're still Naruto. You can't beat me with this Jutsu," Kakashi started to say when he felt something behind him.<p>Another clone jumped up and grabbed Kakashi from behind, wrapping his arms around Kakashi's body.<p>"What? Behind me?" Kakashi yelled in mock horror.<p>Naruto completely unknowingly sped forward along with his shadow clones. The clone holding onto Kakashi began to speak.<p>"Weren't ninjas not supposed to get caught from behind? Right, Kakashi sensei?" Naruto mocked. "Using the Kage Bunshin I sent a clone out of the water to sneak around behind you! My ass is still hurting! Here comes the revenge!" Naruto yelled loudly.<p>Sakura and Sasuke gave Naruto their acknowledgements in their heads. They were both surprised to see Naruto giving Kakashi what seemed to be a hard time. Of course this didn't last for very long. Kakashi quickly performed a Kawarimi no Jutsu grabbing one of the Naruto clones. What Kakashi didn't know was the existence of Ranma. Ranma had quickly discovered that he was able to see the battle out of the eyes of all the clones giving him an incredible perspective to the fight. Ranma quickly realized what Kakashi had done and sighed.<p>'Konatsu used that on me a couple of times.' Ranma thought to himself.<p>'"Hey Naruto!"' Ranma yelled out from inside.<p>Naruto, at this time completely engrossed in the fight, completely ignored Ranma. A vein popped in Ranma's head. He was going to have to force himself into the fight. Ranma closed his eyes and started to concentrate. He felt Naruto's energy and followed it until he found Naruto himself. Ranma in a blast of energy shot Naruto out of his position knocking him into the pathways inside Naruto's soul. Naruto looked around and realized what had happened.<p>'"What the hell did you do that for?"' Naruto yelled angrily. '"I was winning!"'<p>'"No you weren't! You were going to fall for one of his traps!"' Ranma yelled back.<p>Naruto looked onto the battle scene and sure enough there was one of his clones now holding another one of his clones, instead of Kakashi. Ranma had stopped him at the last moment realizing what was going to happen. Naruto punched the wall beside him in frustration, and then he sighed with a smile.<p>'"Shit. You better kick his ass!"' Naruto yelled.<p>'"Hell yeah,"' Ranma answered with a smile.<p>Ranma stood on the field. The clones quickly disappeared as Ranma took full control of the body. Kakashi watched from a distance with a serious eye. There was something different about the Naruto was suddenly holding himself now but he just couldn't put a finger on it.<p>'Let's see what he comes up with next. I am surprised he didn't fall for the Kawarimi no Jutsu.' Kakashi thought to himself.<p>Ranma looked around and let his senses broaden. He was getting excited. He had wanted to start the fight off but he had let Naruto fight first just to see what they were dealing with. Ranma understood almost immediately that Naruto wouldn't be able to handle him but he had let him fight. Ranma smiled. Now it was his turn and he was going to show everyone here what he was made of. He continued standing in the middle of field by himself with his eyes closed. Sasuke just watched him with an intense look.<p>'He's. he's different. like before.' Sasuke thought to himself.<p>Sakura watched with a look of boredom.<p>'What is he doing?' She questioned herself, wondering what was going on.<p>Kakashi also wondered what Naruto was up to when he saw him disappear. Kakashi's eyes opened wide in surprise. He looked around everywhere, trying to sense him but he couldn't feel anything.<p>'This isn't right. It's like he just disappeared. What kind of technique is this? What the hell.' Kakashi thought as he continued to hide himself, his novel momentarily forgotten.<p>Sasuke also blinked in surprise.<p>'It's that technique again. What the hell is that?" Sasuke wondered.<p>Sakura just sat there stunned. That was when she heard his voice. Naruto was standing on top of tall tree with his arms around his head.<p>"Now we really start! Get ready Kakashi sensei cause I'm coming right at ya!" Ranma yelled cockily.<p>He jumped off the tree in the direction that Kakashi was hidden. Kakashi just sat there unable to understand how Naruto, of all people, had discovered him when he had been hiding. Very few people had been able to do that in recent years and now a child had done it. Add to the fact that this child was dead last in his class merely added to Kakashi's surprise. Kakashi slowly put away his novel. He didn't know what he was getting into but he was starting to enjoy it more and more. A smile slowly crept into being as he cracked his knuckles and readied himself for Naruto's attack. He watched as Naruto flew through the air when he suddenly formed his hands into a ball. He gasped as he noticed the small aura forming around Naruto's hands. Questions flooded his mind.<p>'What the hell is that? I've never seen a technique like that! He didn't even perform any seals!'<p>"Take this! Moko Takabishi!" Ranma yelled releasing his ki.<p>Kakashi stared at the blue ball as it flew towards him. It definitely wasn't chakra but whatever it was it looked dangerous. Kakashi jumped out of the way dodging the flying projectile. Kakashi looked back at the blue orb only to see it careen into the ground. Kakashi felt the force of the explosion and found himself loosing control in the air. He barely managed to catch his footing on the ground as he caught his breath. That was when he felt the cold metal of a kunai pressed up against his throat. Kakashi's eyes jumped open in surprise.<p>"You know, you really have to start watching your back, Kakashi sensei," Ranma sneered only to find himself holding a piece of wood.<p>Ranma blanked out for a second then threw the log on the ground in slight anger.<p>'Shit, I should have taken the bell then. he's not going to open himself up as much from now on. oh well. makes things more interesting.' Ranma thought to himself happily as he put away his kunai.<p>'"HEY! Stop messing around! Get the damn bell!"' Naruto shouted up to Ranma.<p>'"Alright already,"' Ranma said sighing.<p>Ranma calmed himself down a bit and stretched out his senses again. It was much harder to find Kakashi this time around.<p>'Shit. he's not giving me any breaks anymore. He's as good as Tofu in concealing his presence. no. better. Of course this is expected of a ninja.' Ranma thought to himself with a smile.<p>It was right then he noticed Kakashi's extremely faint presence. He smiled and decided to much less subtle than his last attack.<p>"Hey Kakashi sensei! This is getting boring! Why don't you come out and face me head on? I mean, I already know where you are," Ranma shouted cockily, and then looked straight at where Kakashi was.<p>Kakashi smirked.<p>'Little bastard. heh, well if he wants to take on a jounin, I'll have to show him what a real jounin can do.' Kakashi thought to himself.<p>Kakashi suddenly appeared right in front of Ranma. Sasuke watched with extreme interest. This was definitely not the Naruto he knew. Sakura was also watching with similar thoughts. Kakashi smiled and decided to get serious. Well, at least a little more serious.<p>"You don't seem to have any fear in you. I'll have to show you what it's like to fight a real jounin," Kakashi said.<p>In an instant he projected his chakra through his body. Ranma felt it pulsating through the air. Ranma involuntarily took a step back. Kakashi smirked. Ranma suddenly looked up and smiled a smile that spoke only of extreme confidence. Kakashi involuntarily took a step back.<p>"That's impressive. but nothing compared to the monster inside this kid." Ranma suddenly stated.<p>That statement threw Kakashi off for a second giving Ranma all the time he needed to launch his attack. He immediately gathered a large amount of ki in his hands and ran forward. In a suicide attack he threw a punch, pumped full of ki, straight at Kakashi's midsection. Kakashi unable to recover in time felt the force of the punch and flew backwards smashing into the ground. Sasuke just sat and shivered.<p>'What. what the hell is this.'<p>Sakura was unable to even think a single thought.<p>Kakashi grasped his midsection, unable to comprehend how this kid had managed to hit him so hard. Things were definitely not going as he had planned.<p>' can't be Naruto.' Kakashi thought to himself. 'That kind of power. and what was with that statement. shit. this isn't good.'<p>Ranma smiled and slowly strode forward. Getting the bell now was easy as pie. Of course that was when he felt ever ounce of energy leave him. Ranma's eyes widened as he felt a wave of excruciating pain wash over his body. It was much more intense then before and he could nothing but scream as the pain traveled through his worn out body.<p>"AHHHHHH!" Ranma shouted as he fell to ground in a crumpled heap.<p>Naruto also felt the pain this time and slowly felt his vision fade. Kakashi, Sasuke and Sakura watched this all in utter confusion. Ranma managed to stifle his scream to a whimper yet he couldn't understand what was going on. He coughed as he tried to steady himself when another wave of pain washed over his body making him loose consciousness. His body continued to wriggle as the pain continued to course through his body. Kakashi just stared in horror, then jumped up ignoring his own pain.<p>"Sasuke! Sakura! This test is over! Get down here now!" Kakashi yelled just as the two appeared next to him.<p>"What's wrong with Naruto? What happened?" Sakura asked frightened.<p>Kakashi and Sasuke just stared with the same thought going through their heads.<p>"That's what I'd like to know."<p>Author's notes: Things are finally starting to take shape. What is happening to Naruto and Ranma? Will Kakashi, Sasuke and Sakura find out more about Naruto and Ranma's secret? And what do the Kami's have to say about all this? Answers will be given, as more questions will be raised. Until next time, please R&amp;R!
