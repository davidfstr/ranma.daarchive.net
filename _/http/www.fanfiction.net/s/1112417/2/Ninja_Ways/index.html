</div>Chapter Two: The Awakening<p>A large village next to a mountain cliff lies calmly during the day. Well, about as calm as a village full of ninja's and ninja's in training can get. Etched onto the rock wall on the far side of the village are four massive heads. Each head resembles the face of the four Hokages of the village. Only, currently they were undergoing a few facial alterations.<p>"Get down from there!"<p>"Stop causing so much trouble!"<p>"You'll pay for that!"<p>"Geez. everyday."<p>A young boy, hanging from a rope fixture turns around and yells at everyone behind him.<p>"Shut up you idiots! None of you guys could do something so horrible, that's why I'm incredible!"<p>Wearing a bright red shirt and black drawstring pants he swivels around again, whipping his braided ponytail behind him. He continues his work, the defacing of the Hokage monuments when someone else screams up at him.<p>"What the hell are you doing during class time? Naruto, get down here you moron!"<p>Naruto flinched as he heard the voice.<p>"Yikes! It's Iruka Sensei!"<p>Naruto tried to get himself out of the ropes but ended up entangling himself within the ropes. He hung pathetically as Iruka jumped up and retrieved him. Naruto looked at Iruka once then turned away with a pout on his face. Moments later they were inside the classroom, Naruto on the ground in front of everyone.<p>"Tomorrow is the ninja school's graduation exam! You have failed the last two times. Now is not the time to be causing trouble, moron!" Iruka scolded loudly.<p>Naruto, without even looking at him, answered with a lazy attitude.<p>"Yeah, yea."<p>Something inside Iruka snapped. He looked to the front of the class and yelled out.<p>"Time for a review test on "Henge no Jutsu! Everyone to the front of the class!"<p>"WHAT!"<p>"Perfectly transform into me!" Iruka sensei yelled.<p>The students all came down and lined up in a row. The first student transformed perfectly and so on and so on until Naruto came up. He stood in front of Iruka and looked up at his face. Then with a grin he began the jutsu. He brought out his chakra and performed the in.<p>"TRANSFORM!" Naruto yelled.<p>Iruka watched. A small drop of blood suddenly trickled down Iruka's nose. Then, a tidal wave of blood shot out as he flew backwards. Naruto, currently in the form of a very pretty and very naked red headed girl, blew Iruka sensei a little kiss then turned back.<p>"I call that, Sexy no Jutsu! GYAHAHAHA!" Naruto laughed.<p>Iruka immediately was in his face, his nose already plugged with two tissues.<p>"You dumb-ass! Don't invent stupid skills!" he yelled furiously.<p>Naruto just stood and took the lecture. Iruka dismissed the rest of the students and took Naruto by the neck and dragged him outside again. He propped him up facing the rock monuments of the four Hokages.<p>"You're punishment is to clean up the stupid mess you made!"<p>As Naruto started Iruka glared at him.<p>"I won't let you go home until you clean all it!" Iruka warned.<p>"Like I care! It's not like I have anyone to go home to. Bah." Naruto said, much quieter.<p>Iruka's expression immediately softened and he looked at Naruto with pity. He sighed as he watched Naruto clean. He cleared his voice and called his name.<p>"Naruto." he said while scratching his face.<p>"Now what!" Naruto asked angrily.<p>"Well um. if you can clean all this up, I'll buy you some ramen tonight," Iruka said, scratching his nose.<p>Naruto immediately perked up and his face seemed to shine.<p>"OK! I'll work hard! I will!" Naruto exclaimed with new energy.<p>Hours later Naruto sat in a small booth with ramen noodles hanging from his mouth. He ate away happily when Iruka interrupted him.<p>"Naruto."<p>Naruto perked up and turned to face Iruka.<p>"Why were you doing that to the monument? Don't you know who the Hokage are?"<p>"Of course! Basically, those that receive the Hokage name are the strongest ninjas in the village, right? And among them is the fourth, a hero who saved the village from a fox demon," Naruto answered quickly.<p>"Then why?" Iruka asked, not understanding.<p>"One day I'm going to get the Hokage name." he started then looked up and pointed his chopsticks at Iruka, "Then I'm going to surpass all previous Hokages!"<p>Iruka looked up in surprise. Naruto continued with his speech.<p>"And then. And then I'll make everyone recognize my strength! .By the way sensei, I have a request." Naruto began again.<p>"What? You want seconds?" Iruka asked.<p>"No. can I borrow your leaf head protector?" Naruto pleaded.<p>"Oh this? No, no. This is for after you graduate. This is a symbol that you've come of age. Maybe you'll get one tomorrow," Iruka answered.<p>"STINGY!" Naruto yelled.<p>"Haha, so that's why you removed your goggles," Iruka laughed when Naruto yelled again.<p>"Seconds!"<p>"HUH?" Iruka yelled.<p>Soon enough both of them left and went to their respective homes. Just as soon morning came and Naruto found himself back in the classroom with his head lying on the table. He sat there when Iruka sensei began the graduation exam.<p>"Now for the graduation exam, you will do the Bunshin no Jutsu. When you are called, come to the next room."<p>Naruto perked up in horror.<p>'Damn! That one! That's my worst skill!' Naruto thought silently.<p>As soon as Naruto was called he grudgingly walked into the room and stood ready. With determination he called forth his chakra and performed the in.<p>"BUNSHIN!" Naruto called out.<p>AS the dust cleared Iruka looked for a clone of Naruto. He sighed as he saw it, lying on the floor looking like a dead fish. Naruto looked at Iruka with a scared look.<p>"FAIL!" Iruka yelled out.<p>Naruto fell on the ground as if a nuclear bomb had been thrown at him. That was when Iruka's helper piped in.<p>"Iruka sensei, this is his third time and he did technically create a clone. We could let him pass." he started.<p>Naruto perked up, filled with hope only to have it dashed moments later.<p>"No way Mizuki sensei. Everyone else divided into three but Naruto only created one, and it was a useless one. I can't let him pass," Iruka said with finality.<p>Naruto grit his teeth and stormed out the room. He made his way to a swing that was hung up on the outside courtyard. He sat down and watched everyone be congratulated by their parents. He listened to all the complements and looked down sadly. He even heard the comments that the parents were making about him. They were always looking down on him, and the eyes, the incredibly cold eyes. Naruto involuntarily shivered. He quickly got up and placed his goggles on his forehead and ran off. Iruka stood in the crowd and watched, the Third Hokage standing next to him.<p>"Iruka, I need to speak with you," the Third said to Iruka.<p>"Yes," Iruka answered simply.<p>As Naruto walked away he was suddenly called from behind. He turned around, his black ponytail whipping behind him to find himself face to face with Mizuki. Naruto sat and listened as Mizuki talked to him about Iruka and piped in to complain once in a while. That was when Mizuki said something that made Naruto's ears perk up.<p>"Well then, I'll tell you a special secret." Mizuki started.<p>Naruto listened intently and a smile began to form on his face. When Mizuki finished Naruto ran off yelling his thanks while Mizuki sat and smiled himself. As soon as it became night Naruto crept into the Hokage's house. Soon enough he got caught by the Third himself. Naruto quickly called upon his chakra and performed a jutsu.<p>"Sexy no Jutsu!" Naruto yelled quickly transforming into the cute, and naked red head.<p>The Third lay on the ground, blood running from his nose. Naruto quickly entered the secret chambers and browsed through the scrolls. Finding the right one Naruto grabbed it and ran off into the woods. Mizuki watched him run off, his smile much more sinister. Naruto quickly opened up the scroll and began looking through them.<p>"Let's see. the first skill is, Kage Bunshin? What the hell! Why does it start with the one I'm bad with?" Naruto yelled to himself.<p>Naruto quickly began training himself. As he trained he felt something twinge inside of him. Ignoring it he continued. As he used more and more chakra the strange feeling inside him became larger and larger. Ignoring it he trained throughout the night.<p>*****<p>Iruka lay in bed contemplating what the Third had said. He thought about how closely his childhood had been to Naruto's. He found himself drifting off when he heard a knock at his door. He quickly got up and opened it to find Mizuki yelling. Soon enough him and many other ninjas were off in search of Naruto.<p>'Why the hell would Naruto take the Scroll of Forbidden Seals? What in the world is he thinking? Hmm. I should check the woods while I'm at it.' Iruka thought to himself while searching.<p>He spotted Naruto lying on the ground, covered in sweat and gasping for air.<p>"I've found you!" Iruka growled angrily.<p>"Hey! It's the nose bleeder!" Naruto yelled back cheerfully.<p>The cheerfulness threw Iruka off.<p>"Hehehe, you found me, I've only learned one skill." Naruto said through gasps of air.<p>"Hey, you're all beaten up. What were you doing?" Iruka asked.<p>"Never mind that! Hey, hey! I'm going to try an incredible skill! If I do it. will you let me graduate?" Naruto asked full of hope.<p>Iruka just looked at him in wonder.<p>'So you were practicing here. enough to damage your body?' Iruka thought.<p>"Naruto, where did you get that scroll?" Iruka asked finally.<p>"Oh this? Mizuki sensei told me about it and where to get it too!" Naruto said obliviously. "He said that I showed you this skill, I would definitely graduate!"<p>Iruka looked shocked for a moment when he sensed an attack. He quickly pushed Naruto to the ground taking the entire hit. He was thrown back as a flurry of shurikens hit him. Iruka looked up to see Mizuki smiling.<p>"Nice job in finding him," Mizuki said.<p>"I see, so that's what's going on." Iruka whispered.<p>"Naruto! Give me the scroll!" Mizuki yelled.<p>"Hey, hey! What's going on here? Hey!" Naruto yelled completely confused.<p>"Naruto! Don't give him the scroll even if you die!" Iruka yelled. "That is a dangerous scroll that has forbidden ninjutsu sealed within it! Mizuki used you in order to get his hands on it!"<p>Naruto immediately glared at Mizuki. That was when Mizuki smiled.<p>"Naruto, there's no need for you to have it. I'll tell you the truth." Mizuki said, smiling wider now.<p>Iruka stared up at Mizuki in horror.<p>"N-NO! DON'T!" he yelled.<p>"12 years ago, you know about he demon fox being sealed, right? Since then, a new rule was created for this village," Mizuki started.<p>"A rule.?" Naruto asked in confusion.<p>"But Naruto, this rule was never meant to be told to you." Mizuki said, starting to laugh now.<p>"Not to me? What is this rule? WHY?" Naruto yelled.<p>Mizuki just laughed as Naruto watched.<p>"What. kind of rule is it?" Naruto asked, becoming frightened.<p>"The rule is that nobody is allowed to talk about the fact that you are the demon fox," Mizuki finished.<p>"Huh?" Naruto said, not completely grasping what had been just said. "What do you mean?"<p>"STOP IT!" Iruka yelled at the top of his lungs.<p>"It means. that you are the nine tailed demon fox that killed Iruka's parents and destroyed the village," Mizuki stated, blatantly ignoring Iruka. "You were sealed up by the Hokage you admire and.!"<p>"STOP IT!" Iruka yelled again.<p>"You were lied to by everyone! Didn't you find it odd how everyone hated you? Iruka is the same! He actually hates you!" Mizuki yelled, pulling out his shuriken.<p>Iruka just looked stunned.<p>'Naruto.'<p>"DAMN IT! DAMN IT! DAMN IT!" Naruto yelled, gathering chakra unlike he had ever done before.<p>Naruto completely blocked everything out of his mind at that point and began to dive deeper into the darkness he had known for so long. He found himself running inside of himself. He just continued running when he ran into someone, well more like tripped over. It was completely by accident but Naruto fell forward. The person groggily woke up and looked around. Naruto looked at him once and yelled out.<p>"Who the hell are you!"<p>The person in front of him looked up. He was wearing the same thing Naruto was and looked exactly like him. Naruto backed away as the person stood up and stretched.<p>"Yo. So you're the one I had to save, ne?"<p>"Huh?" Naruto said in confusion.<p>"Never mind. I'll explain later. I think you're bodies in trouble right now though. I don't want to die, and if this body goes I go as well so get your ass in gear and stop freaking out!" the person yelled.<p>Naruto finally broke out of his shock and realized that everything the boy had said was true. He finally opened his eyes when he noticed the shuriken flying at him. He shut his eyes again when he felt a body come over him. Naruto slowly opened his eyes to find Iruka standing over him protectively. Tears began to well up in Naruto's eyes.<p>"Why.?" Naruto asked.<p>"My parents, after they were died. there was no one to compliment me or acknowledge me. I was so sad. I would always act like an idiot to get people's attention since I wasn't able to do well in school and get attention that way. It was better then being nothing so I kept acting like an idiot. It was so painful. yeah, Naruto, you must have been in a lot of pain too." Iruka said, tears running down his face from the pain, both externally and internally. "I'm sorry Naruto, if only I had done a better job, you wouldn't have had to feel like this."<p>Naruto looked up at Iruka once more, then at Mizuki. Without thinking he got up and ran. He ignored the cries and just ran when the voice inside him yelled at him again.<p>"What the hell are you doing? How can you run from a fight?" the voice yelled.<p>"What am I supposed to do?" Naruto yelled, not caring that he was yelling at himself.<p>"You stand and fight! Like a real man!"<p>"Against Mizuki sensei? What the hell am I supposed to do?" Naruto yelled, hating himself more and more.<p>"It doesn't matter how, it's that you do, MORON!" the voice yelled louder.<p>Naruto ignored the voice and ran around a tree in time to see Iruka attack Mizuki sensei. Both of them landed near Naruto. Naruto sat and listened to them argue.<p>"Hehehe, you'd even transform into what killed your parents to protect him?" Mizuki sneered.<p>"I won't hand the scroll over to an idiot like you!" Iruka yelled back.<p>"You're the idiot! Naruto and I are the same," Mizuki started.<p>"The same?" Iruka said confused.<p>"If you use the skills in that scroll, you can do whatever you want! There's no way that the Demon Fox wouldn't try to use those powers! Unlike what you're assuming." Mizuki said loudly.<p>"Yeah." Iruka said softly, but loud enough for Naruto hear.<p>Naruto gripped the scroll tighter. The darkness inside him seemed to grip him tighter and tighter. The voice in his head seemed to understand and didn't say a thing. Naruto just sat in silence.<p>'Damn. I knew it. see. even Iruka sensei doesn't acknowledge me.' Naruto thought silently when Iruka began speaking again.<p>"The Demon Fox would do that. but Naruto is different. he is.I've acknowledged him as one of my excellent students!" Iruka said with strength. "He may not be the hardest worker. and he's clumsy so nobody accepts him. He already knows what it is to feel pain in your heart. He isn't the Demon Fox anymore. He is a member of the Hidden Leaf Village. He's. he's Uzumaki Naruto!"<p>Naruto sat there with tears running down his face. The voice suddenly spoke up again.<p>"Get your ass up and go fight now! You don't have much time!"<p>Naruto quickly turned around, sprung off his feet and launched himself towards Mizuki who had started up another attack on Iruka. His foot connected with Mizuki's face. Iruka just sat in shock.<p>'Naruto.'<p>"You shouldn't have done that!" Mizuki yelled in pain.<p>Naruto slowly stood up from the ground and leveled a glare straight at Mizuki. For a moment a shiver ran up and down Mizuki's spine.<p>"Don't touch Iruka-sensei. I'll kill you!" Naruto yelled.<p>"You idiot! Why did you come out? Run Away!" Iruka yelled with the rest of his energy.<p>"Shut up! Punks like you I'll kill in one shot!" Mizuki shouted back at Naruto.<p>"Try it trash! I'll return the pain a thousand times over!" Naruto yelled back slowly gathering his chakra.<p>"Then do it Demon Fox!" Mizuki yelled when he noticed the sudden spike in chakra.<p>"Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!" Naruto yelled loudly, creating hundreds of replicas of him.<p>Mizuki just stood stunned looking around frantically.<p>"Wha? What's going on?" Mizuki yelled scared.<p>"What's wrong? Come at me! Weren't you going to kill me with one shot?" all the Naruto clones yelled in sequence.<p>Mizuki fell back in shock while Iruka just watched in awe. The voice inside Naruto seemed to smile. The multitude of clones began to crack their knuckles.<p>"Well then. I'll start things off!" Naruto yelled.<p>Mizuki's eyes just widened in horror. Moments later he lay on the ground, looking like he had been hit by a truck. Iruka smirked as Naruto finished up. As the clones began to fade the real Naruto walked up to Mizuki and stood above him.<p>"Hehe, I went a little too far." Naruto smirked, tugging on his pigtail, a habit he had had since he had grown the pigtail.<p>Iruka sat up as far as he could.<p>"Naruto come over here. There's something I want to give you. Now close your eyes," he started.<p>Naruto came over to Iruka and shut his eyes as he was told. He felt something placed on his forehead.<p>"Sensei, now?" Naruto asked.<p>"Ok, you can open your eyes," Iruka said smiling proudly.<p>Naruto opened them slowly. He saw Iruka beaming at him.<p>"Congratulations on graduating," Iruka said with a big smile. "Let's celebrate! I'll buy you a bowl of ramen!"<p>Naruto just sat there without saying a word. Iruka looked down when he was suddenly he was grabbed by Naruto as he wrapped his arms around Iruka in a big hug.<p>"Hey! That hurts!" Iruka complained jokingly.<p>The voice inside Naruto remained quiet when he began to talk to himself.<p>"I think I'll like it here. Naruto seems like an interesting guy. Strong too. Wish I could use the body as I wanted too. sigh. Well, maybe he'll let me use it from time to time. Shit, this is boring. Never thought I'd miss life in Nerima."<p>Soon enough day became night and Naruto bid farewell to Iruka, heading home soon after. As he entered his house Naruto sat down on his bed and examined the leaf head protector and smiled brightly. That was when the voice in his head piped in again.<p>"Hey! You still there? Can you hear me?" the voice screamed.<p>"HEY! Shut up! Who the hell are you?" Naruto yelled back, pointing off into space.<p>Naruto listened but only heard the wind bristling against the trees and crickets chirping outside. Naruto sat there with a blank look on his face. The voice suddenly spoke again.<p>"Geez! You don't have to be so damn loud! I'm right inside you, you moron," the voice complained.<p>"Huh? Inside me?" Naruto asked, completely confused. "Who are you?"<p>"My names Ranma Saotome. Heir to the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts, not that you'd know what that is," the voice started.<p>".."<p>Naruto stared at the wall with a blank face. His left eye began to twitch.<p>"What the hell! Who do you think you are?" Naruto yelled, not really making much sense.<p>"Shut up while I tell you what I know. Both of us are involved and if we don't work together, as much as I hate the idea of having to work with you, we're both gonna get screwed!" Ranma shouted inside Naruto.<p>Naruto winced slightly. There was something about Ranma's voice that commanded listening. Ranma, whoever the hell he was, had been through much more then had, Naruto quickly realized. For once he kept quiet.<p>"Well then, now that I have your attention. Here's what I know so far, and don't ask any questions 'till I'm done. I'm not from your world. I come from a place called Japan, not that it matters anymore. Anyways, I was minding my own business when all of a sudden my soul was literally ripped in half by some Kami or something, I think. Anyways, she told me that I would still survive but that she needed half of my soul to save someone. That someone of course is you. I don't know what happened but I found myself inside your body. Well actually my body. From what I've seen so far, this is the body I had back in my world. I don't know how it ended up here but it is. We're basically sharing this body, even if you do have control of it. Well, that doesn't matter for now. I've been awake for about two weeks now. It was when you made up that Sexy no Jutsu attack. The technique requires usage of my energy, I think, so it woke me up. The reason its only this technique. err. you don't need to worry about that," Ranma stuttered quickly.<p>'No way in hell am I gonna tell him it's because he turns into my cursed form! Didn't think I'd see that again. Oh well.' Ranma thought quickly.<p>"Anyways, from what I've gathered of you in the last two weeks is that you are a ninja in training, I guess. Not a very good student though. You're a complete moron who causes more trouble then you're worth. However, you have the potential to be incredible, partly because you have my body, and partly because of other things, some of which I only have a vague idea of," Ranma continued.<p>'Especially that evil energy that I keep sensing inside him. It's not a part of him but something. something else. It's like someone else is in this body.' Ranma mused silently.<p>"So now that we have that much settled, I have a proposition for you. I'll help you become an incredible fighter, enough to get that stupid Hokage title you want so bad. In return you'll let me control the body from time to time, if we can that is. If not then, well I'll think of that later. So what do you say?" Ranma said with hope in his voice.<p>Naruto just sat there absorbing everything he had just heard. Thoughts flew around in his head. Unable to organize everything he took the first thought he could grasp and went from there.<p>"You can make me stronger?" Naruto asked.<p>"Damn straight," Ranma said with confidence. "But you'll have to let me use this body."<p>"Well, how would I let you take control?" Naruto asked.<p>"Um, how about you come here, like when you were running and tripped over me," Ranma suggested.<p>"Err. how do I do that?" Naruto asked.<p>"I don't know! Just. just do it!" Ranma yelled.<p>A vein popped in Naruto's head. Then he sighed. He closed his eyes and concentrated as best as he could. He tried to picture the place that he had run to when suddenly he was there. Naruto opened his eyes to find himself face to face with Ranma. Naruto stared. Ranma had the body that Naruto saw everyday in the mirror. Naruto moved forward when he felt the water around his foot. He looked down and saw his reflection. He saw someone he couldn't recognize. He looked up at Ranma.<p>"Is. is this the true me?" Naruto asked pointing at his reflection.<p>"I- I guess so," Ranma said, not entirely sure.<p>Naruto just stared. Then he looked up at Ranma. He sat down in the water.<p>"What the hell does this mean then? I'm the Nine Tailed Demon Fox but I'm also you and me!" Naruto yelled in frustration.<p>'That must be the evil energy,' Ranma quickly thought.<p>"Who the hell am I?" Naruto yelled out.<p>Ranma felt sorry for the boy in front of him. From what he had gathered he had quickly realized that Naruto was hated by almost everyone in the village. No friends at all. Ranma knew what it was like not to have any friends. When Naruto had returned home Ranma had seen Naruto cry himself to sleep. No parents, no friends, no one at all. The loneliness must have eaten away at him. Ranma placed his hand on Naruto's shoulder.<p>"Hey, think of it this way. You'll never be alone ever again, whether you want to or not," Ranma said with a smile.<p>Naruto looked up and sighed. His entire world had been flipped upside down in a matter of hours yet Naruto had gained things of immeasurable value as well. Naruto smiled thinking of Iruka sensei and now Ranma.<p>"Yeah. You're right. So why don't you go take control. I'll be right here when you come back," Naruto said with a smile.<p>Ranma smiled back. Both of them stared at each other's eyes. In that moment their entire lives flashed in front of each other. Naruto felt the pain and suffering Ranma had gone through and vice versa. Then in a flash Ranma was gone. Naruto just sat down and closed his eyes as he once again became one with his body, only no he had no control over it. He watched Ranma control the body. Ranma immediately leapt out the room and roof hopped all the way to the forest again. The way Ranma ran and moved was different then the way a ninja moved yet just as effective, if not more so. He was incredibly fast and deathly quiet.<p>"He's definitely the owner of this body. He knows more about it then I do," Naruto said as he felt Ranma stretch.<p>Ranma began stretching all the kinks out of his body. After about ten minutes he sat down and began meditating.<p>"What are you doing?" Naruto asked.<p>"Meditating. You'll feel much stronger when you get in the body next," Ranma said serenely.<p>"Oh," Naruto answered.<p>Soon enough Ranma got up and began going through some basic katas. He quickly went through the basic ones to warm up. Finally, he began to test the body. He approached a tree, closed his eyes, and concentrated hard. Then he opened his eyes and shouted.<p>"Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken!"<p>In a moment he punched the tree in front of him over 800 times. From there Ranma went through every technique that he could think of including the Moko Takabishi and the Hiryu Shoten Ha. Naruto's eye's widened as he watched Ranma use the body he had used for his entire life in ways he couldn't even imagine. Ranma stopped after that and stretched his arms.<p>"Man! This is incredible! I have so much ki! This is great!" Ranma yelled.<p>"Ki? You mean Chakra?" Naruto asked.<p>"Chakra? I was meaning to ask, what is chakra? I heard about it in one of your classes but I forgot to pay attention," Ranma asked.<p>"Err. I'm not exactly sure," Naruto said sheepishly.<p>Ranma just stared at the tree stump in front of him.<p>"Whatever, it doesn't matter. Hey, is that the stuff you used to do all your jutsus? If it is then I don't think I'll care. You use chakra and I'll use my ki. Well, since they're two different things inside us we'll be able to fight twice as long as other people. I'm guessing most people here don't know about ki, or else don't use it consciously. That gives us a huge advantage right there," Ranma concluded ignorantly.<p>"Yeah!" Naruto screamed.<p>Ranma just stood there nodding his head, his ego growing, while Naruto did much the same inside. That was when Ranma snapped his fingers.<p>"Hey! I can unlock the two sealed techniques that my dad created! I'm not in that world anymore, and I'm sure he wouldn't mind. The Umisen-ken and Yamasen-ken should help me out a lot!" Ranma shouted.<p>He quickly gathered up his chi and shot out two Kijin Raishu Dans at the closest tree that hadn't already been decimated. The tree was cut right in half by the two vacuum chi-blades. Ranma looked at his handy work and smiled. People were going to looking at Naruto completely different from now on.<p>"Ok Naruto, I can do all my techniques but you won't be able to because you don't know how to use ki. It would take too long to teach you so you should practice your own stuff that use your chakra. In a fight, we'll be able to switch between us and use different techniques. It should completely throw people off. That alone will give us a huge advanta-" Ranma started when he suddenly fell to the ground.<p>Ranma's eyes dilated as he lay on the ground. Naruto suddenly found himself falling to the ground, inside of him, as well. The two of them gasped for air as they lay there. After a few minutes both of them got up, Naruto on the inside and Ranma in the real world.<p>"Shit. I used too much ki. I guess my ki is tied to your chakra more then I thought. I guess we'll have to conserve our energy better," Ranma said breathing hard.<p>'What the hell was that? That didn't feel right. definitely not like when I usually use up my ki. no. it hurt way too much for that to be the reason.' Ranma thought silently.<p>Ranma straightened his back as best he could and practiced one of his many breathing techniques. After about ten minutes Ranma stood up slowly, breathing much slower now yet still not normally. He slowly walked his way home when Naruto decided to take over.<p>"Switch with me and take a rest," Naruto said as Ranma retracted himself.<p>As Naruto took control again a wave of pain caused Naruto to drop to the ground as well.<p>"Shit. I'm. so. damn. tired." Naruto whispered into the forest as he gave into the darkness.<p>'Damn. this isn't right. We shouldn't be this tired. even if I seem to be recuperating right now. what the hell is going on with this body.' Ranma thought when a wave of weariness overtook him.<p>'No point in thinking about it now.' Ranma thought as he too gave into the darkness.<p>Both souls lay in the forest breathing slowly. A third merely sat in silence. Things had just become much more interesting.<p>Author's Notes: Wow. That took a long time. I finally know where I want to take this story. Next time Ranma/ Naruto meets up with more members of the Hidden Leaf village. Surprises abound as Ranma reveals the power of his techniques to the ninja village. Please R&amp;R!
