</div>Ranma 1/2<br/>Easy Target 2; Dirty Shot<br/>Finale<p>Ranma sat in the seat place in front of Richter's desk, as the latter had his back turned while he thumbed through a sizable amount of American currency. Ranma would have been fearing Richter's wrath for continuing with a mission that he was specifically ordered not to pursue, knowing how harshly the Austrian man dealt with those he felt had gone rogue. But presently, the young hitman didn't really care. If push came to shove, he would simply leave this life behind like he had Nerima; he loathed to run away from any of his problems, but it wouldn't benefit him any to stay with a target placed over his head. The ponytailed man grunted, waiting for Richter to finish making him stew in silence, as he contemplated the punishment for Ranma.<p>"Eight hundred thousand American dollars for a job well done," Richter said, turning around with an expressionless face that didn't cover the humor in his eyes. Ranma blinked, and picked up the cash that was tossed onto the desk.<p>He used his Amaguriken speed to count and double count the amount, and then looked up at his employer, "Huh? What's this for?"<p>"You finished off the assassin that was running amok throught this city. That is just the initial contract fee, plus bonus. You can expect gratuity from many of the other heads for this job too."<p>"Bonus?" Ranma stared with raised eyebrows."<p>"Yes," Richter answered, "this man... Northrop, also made assignment of one of our operatives. I believe you are aware of my policy concerning hits on my own men?"<p>"I guess..." Ranma replied, still puzzled.<p>"Though you *had* gone against my orders, I am greatly indebted to you. Even Oyabun Takeo wishes to express his gratitude, but more formally, and in person." Ranma grew a slight frown, as he was reminded of another matter of business he needed to take care of; who had hired Northrop in the first place.<p>"Uh, sir? This is also the pay amount for two operatives. I thought that if Rugar wasn't here to pick his own pay up, that it would be held for him until he is able to claim it?"<p>"I'm sure that if you were loyal enough to go beyond my own orders in leu of revenge on his behalf; you can be trusted with his fee."<p>Ranma almost huffed, "I didn't do it for him."<p>Straumhaus waved Ranma off, before continuing, "We aren't bad men, Ranma. We provide a service that is appreciated by both sides of the law in this city. I remember when Rugar first brought you to me, how appauled you were with this business, until we put things into perspective..." Ranma nodded, recalling the examples given to him of a little girl to one of the local polititions being brutally murdered as punishment for failing to be persuaded by certain factions, and of the doctor who was assigned as a target that Ranma was sent to counter the hit and keep the lady medical doctor from becoming another 'example'.<p>"True, none of us are without our flaws or past, but in this business, it is best we move beyond them before they bring us down further. Do not do this for revenge, do it for the propriety and nessessity of it all. Even Rugar could not be without his flaws, and he should be forgiven for them." Richter turned back to the plate glass window of his office, "And, onto other business. Daniel Rugar has named me sequiter of his estate..."<p>"Huh?" Ranma wasn't sure what that meant, but the mention of his partner's full name and the word 'estate' set alarm bells off.<p>"As you may be aware, Mr. Rugar had no family that could be contacted, so if anything were to happen to him, all his holdings and estate would fall to the hands of his younger sister that he was very fond of."<p>"That doesn't make sense," Ranma replied, "You just said Dan had no family that you..." in realization, Ranms' expression grew annoyed, before mumbling, "Bastard."<p>Richter chuckled lightly, before regaining his composure and continuing, "Yes, well, I was just to inform you, that if events concerning our mutual associate and... friend... make a turn for the worse, that there will be some paperwork that you'll have to fill out... before things can be fully settled after his passing."<p>"But he's not dead!" Ranma almost shouted, not holding back the emotion he was feeling at being reminded at Dan's condition.<p>"Do not disheart, I only wished to inform you of what you could... what is possible to suspect," Richter stated, correcting himself so not to upset Ranma even more. "But, I will have to state, that whatever toxin is coursing through him right now, was dangerous enough to effectively end his career with this organization. it was apparently made to irreperrably collapse the resperitory system with damage to the nervous system. As such, it falls upon me to have to name his successor for his position." Richter Straumhaus turned to Ranma, "He has always held you in high regard, and I heartily agree with him."<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow, "But... you were, I mean..."<p>"I know I seemed a bit... harsh towards you," Richter replied, knowing Ranma would be courteous enough not to finish his statement, "for the reason that I did not want you to become lax. You have great potential, and I wanted to see how far you could push yourself. And from what I've seen, I am not dissappointed."<p>"Uh, thank you... sir, but..."<p>"It's Richter to my closest associates."<p>Ranma stood, and bowed, "Thank you, sir... Richter, but I am afraid that I will have to consider this a bit." As Ranma straightened up, he willed the emotion from his face, "There is other business that I must discuss with you..."<p>Ranma sat in seiza across from his host, while his most trusted associates and advisors sat in on the meeting, and bowed from her position, "I am honored as your guest, Takeo-san."<p>"It is you that brings great honor to me with your presence," Takeo replied with a deeper bow; allowing his forehead to touch the floor, "You had saved the life of this humbled man, but you have done a great service to the city that its residents may thankfully never know about."<p>"It was in the contract," Ranma stated offhandedly, "If I may, I would like to concern you with information concerning as to who Northrop's solicitor was."<p>Takeo raised an eyebrow, "Indeed?"<p>The redhead's face grew firm, "Yes, and I believe my conclusion is valid and just." Ranma seemed to recite from memory, as it was drilled into him how to approach this delicate and potentially explosive subject, "That night, when the 'attempt' was made on your life, the toxin that was used was blowfish excretement..." Ranma narrowed her eyes, "a toxin that you have had experience in."<p>"Yes," Takeo replied, guilelessly, "I often partake in fugu sashimi, and it is not the first time someone foolish had attempted to use such a poison on me."<p>"That's why you happen to have an antidote handy," Ranma's voice was growing more neutral by the moment.<p>The crime boss raised an eyebrow, "It seems as if you are implying something."<p>"My partner had... faced off against the same man. An unidentifiable toxin was used on his system that medical doctors have yet to be able to contain or reverse its ill effects, though currently his condition is beyond severe, but stable."<p>Takeo's face grew grim, "And you wonder, why is it that this same poison was not used on me, instead of one I have a slight tolerance to?"<p>"That would have been my question, if I didn't already know the answer," Ranma replied simply. Takeo's advisors and guards reached for their weapons, but their employer waved them to stop.<p>"That is an acceptable deduction that you risk your neck for by shouting freely in the tiger's den. You are indeed bold as you are beautiful..."<p>Ranma held her temper in check from the pass made at her, and bowed again, "I apologise, it was not my intention to make undue accusations against you."<p>"Then you are quite a confused young woman," Takeo almost growled.<p>"Allow me to explain. It is greatly known that you are a well respected and credentious man who upholds his honor above his position. As is the reason you were willing to use yourself as bait in order to subdue Northrop in the first place."<p>"Indeed."<p>"And, because of your trusted position, I also understand that you would take it upon yourself, that if a great deal of territory were to become open, due to the ridding of your competition, you would take it upon yourself to claim it for completely just and prudent reasons. You also would be the most favored to succeed in this, if other families were to compete against you."<p>"That is true," the crimeboss replied, factually, "but it still seems as if it is an accusation towards me."<p>"I also understand, that you would feel honorbound to not want to hold such power by your own. Tell me, Takeo-san, what would you do if you succeeded in gaining a massive amount of territory to your own?"<p>"Why, I would divide it amonsts my most trusted advisors and associates that I feel would be befitting of governing the area justly."<p>"Much like a Shogunate," Ranma-chan answered, and then pointfully looked around the room to see who would squirm at the implications. Takeo's mind suddenly caught onto what was being implied. Of course, it would be a perfect way for someone under him to gain their own individual power. With startling realization, he turned to his most trusted advisor, the one that had urged him to not remain to take on Northrop with what now could be realized as false sincerity. This advisor, that checked the previous day to ensure that Takeo's poison antidotes were up to date, even going as far as to refill the antidote for blowfish toxin.<p>Ranma's eyes followed her hosts, and the man under scruteny started to become increasingly nervous. Takeo's face started to twist in fury, and without taking his eyes off the man, the crime boss reached for his short sword...<p>Ranma sat at home, contemplating her previous meeting. It had gone as well as she had hoped, even being offered a position as Takeo's right hand woman, in order to replace the one that had been... forcably removed from his position under the crime head. The man felt thrice indebted to her, and insisted that any favor she would ask would be met as by him graciously and without hesitation.<p>Now that that was behind her, Ranma had to wonder what was next. She was now being given a promotion under Richter at Dan's expense, but felt still that she could not truly accept it. Ranma wasn't positive it was because she didn't truly know as much about the man who had previously served in it, that to take it would mean giving up on him, or that she may not be completely ready for it.<p>The redhead's reverie was shaken away by the knock at her door. Ranma cautiously approached the door, and looked through the spyhole to find Kim at the other side. "Come on in, I wasn't expecting you," Ranma-chan replied, letting her friend in.<p>Ranma noted the rather thin clothing that Kim was wearing that was showing the outlines of the small costume she was wearing not too long ago for work, and redirected her eyes with a slight blush that Kim didn't miss, but chose not to mention it, "I... didn't want to go straight home just yet. So I was hoping that you wouldn't mind some company."<p>"Ah, well, you're always welcome here... I guess," Ranma replied with a slightly distracted tone that had nothing to do with her hormones at the moment.<p>"Ah, Yohiko, something wrong? Has your husband come back home yet?"<p>Ranma looked back to the woman, "Uh, no, he hasn't. It's nothing to do with him."<p>"Then what's wrong?"<p>Kim motioned Ranma to sit down onto the couch with her to start explaining, "Well, ah, I kinda got a promotion at work that would... pay pretty well..."<p>Kim's eyes lightened, "Well, that's GREAT news! Why are you so upset about it?"<p>"It kinda.. comes at a price. The guy who originally held it may not be around... much longer."<p>"Oh..." the Korean woman replied, allowing a few minutes of silence to spread between them. Kim once again spoke, "I guess, you were pretty close with him?"<p>"Yeah... he was like a... brother to me.." Ranma said in a subdued voice, while hiding the twitch in her left eye from Kim, "I feel like I don't deserve it, really. Or that if I did, it would be compromising my own morals."<p>Kim's face grew stern, "Yohiko, listen, you are the most caring and wonderful person I have ever had the privelege of meeting in my life. In fact, if not for you, I would probably have broken down, and be back at my parent's after giving up here, and I only met you a few days ago. If he was really that close to you, he would be an idiot NOT to insist you take it, if he's as bad off as you're making it sound."<p>"But... it feels like I'm giving up on him," Ranma-chan almost sobbed, "I mean, without him, I would be, I would be nothing!"<p>Kim sensed the emotional underturrent of her friend, and moved to a comforting embrace. The Korean woman didn't want to bring up the question of where Yohiko's husband was at this apparent time of crisis, "Don't be like that, Yohiko. I think he would be honored to have you take over for him. If it were me, there wouldn't be anyone more I would trust. But are you just afraid that taking his place means that he's really going to die?"<p>Yohiko broke down, "He was the only friend I had for the longest time. I... I, said some things, accused him of things I had no right to..."<p>"I'm sure he understands, it's okay..." Kim cooed, lightly holding the redhead.<p>The next night, Ranma sat in the chair, looking over Daniel Rugar's prone and sleeping body. The ponytailed man had been there the whole day, just watching the first friend he had truly gained in the years since he left Nerima. Rugar had degenerated to a frailer version of himself, though his large frame still looked to hold some power in its near lifeless shell. Ranma knew that when Rugar recovered, not if, but *when*, he truly would not be able to continue his duties.<p>Ranma finally stood up, coming to a descision, and spoke softly but firmly, "I accept." Ranma pulled a bullet from one of the clips for Rugar's dagger guns, and placed it in his former partner's hands. He bowed deeply out of the utmost respect, kinship, and comaradery, before walking from the room, and turning out the lights. Once Ranma was gone, Dan's hand clenched around the bullet.<p>A light smile crossed the Irish national's face; he guessed this meant that he was officially forced into retirement...<p>Ranma walked from the hospital into the rain, and turned to look towards the room that Rugar was being held in. The redhead wondered why the lights were turned on to the room, and raised an eyebrow as one of the nurses closed the blinds to the room. With a bit more of a pause, Ranma continued her journey home.<p>At eight forty-two P.M., regardless of the frantic docters' attempts, Daniel M. Rugar was pronounced dead.<p>Credits:<p>Ranma Saotome... Ranma Saotome<br/>Ranko/Yohiko Saotome... Ranma Saotome<br/>Daniel M. Rugar... Clarence McCleary<br/>Northrop... Mitch Grumman<br/>Squeaky...
