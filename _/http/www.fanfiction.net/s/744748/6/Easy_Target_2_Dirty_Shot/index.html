</div>Ranma 1/2<br/>Easy Target 2; Dirty Shot<br/>Part 6<p>Ranma-chan gave her new friend a wary look, as they waited to arrive at their stop, "Um, about that magazine, it's my husband's, really..."<p>Kim didn't turn to look at the other woman, "It's okay, really. It's... none of my business anyhow."<p>"I'm not really like that, I'm a happily married man, er, woman."<p>"I understand," Kim replied in an even tone, keeping her eyes straight, "Oh, here's our stop!"<p>"Oh.. and, um, sorry about the mess on your hand," Ranma apologised sheepishly, and became a bit more chagrinned as her friend's already green complextion became a bit more pronounced.<p>"Sir, most the other major heads of the city have saught refuge, it is advised you do the same..."<p>Oyabun Takeo raised a hand to forstall any more advisements from his trusted men, "If you wish for the tiger to approach the trap, you must supply enticing bait. And for the tiger to be felled, that bait must be just as deadly."<p>"Takeo-san, you don't honestly mean to say that you're going to be the bait for this assassin?"<p>"That is my intention, yes," Takeo replied, looking up from his lotus position. He was dressed in his full samurai outfit sans armor, with his dashio sitting in front of him. He was meditating to prepare for an intense fight that he would be the victer of, regardless of how powerful his opponent was.<p>He knew he would be the next target, as he was currently the largest head of his own territory without being assosiated with another head. And as renowned as he was, his death would bring a great deal of chaos among everyone, as was the intent of the assasin, he had now surmised.<p>"Sir, if you would allow me permission to at least assign some of our best men..."<p>"ENOUGH! I do not want his suspicions aroused. The guard placement will remain as it always has, but prepare the men to evacuate once our advisary is seen on the premesis. Then it will be up to me to end this."<p>Takeo's advisor nodded hesistantly, and then left to inform the men of their boss's plans. Takeo himself continued to sit in meditation, imagining his sword as divine vengence.<p>Kim walked out of the bathroom after washing her hands for the forth time that morning. Ranma herself was grumbling on how great of a start she was hitting it off with the other woman, and had no ideas on how to rectify the situation.<p>Kim sat down and looked at the menu. Her face had thankfully gone back to it's normal compextion, the redhead noticed, but now her expression was becoming a bit nervous and sullen as she looked through the menu. That didn't escape Ranma's notice.<p>"Um, something wrong?"<p>Kim put down the menu, and forced a smile, "Well, I'm not really that hungry for lunch. How about we stop at a McDonalds or something?"<p>The pigtailed woman blanched, "Uh, here's fine. Don't worry about finishing what you don't eat, though the food is so good that shouldn't be a problem."<p>"But, um, these... well I don't really see much of what I want, I'm afraid."<p>Ranma-chan tilted her head, "What's wrong?"<p>Kim bowed her head in slight shame, "Well, since moving out to this city, I'm afraid I don't have much money, and I haven't started work yet so I'm afraid I can't spend much right now."<p>Ranma raised her eyebrows, and restrained herself from slapping her forehead. The only other person she had ever gone out with was Dan, and neither of them were exactly hurting for money, "Oh, don't worry about it. Didn't I tell ya I'll cover you?"<p>Kim picked up the menu again, skimmed over it, and then looked back towards her new friend, "I can't let you do that. These prices are..."<p>"Something I'm used to, don't worry about it," Ranma-chan said, as she waved the argument off dismissively.<p>"But... these prices are OUTRAGIOUS!"<p>Ranma blinked at the other woman's outburst, "Um, it's not a problem, really."<p>"How can you say that when you live in a dump like..." Kim stopped, and stared at a slightly irritated redhead in shock, "Oh, I didn't mean, I mean, that..."<p>"Like I said earlier, it was the first thing I came across," Ranma-chan replied in a non-chilant attitude she didn't quite feel, "Are you ready to order, or not?" Kim bowed her head, and nodded meekly.<p>"Well, I guess I better head home, I have to work tonight," Kim said in a subdued voice.<p>Ranma-chan sighed, "I guess, I probably need to get back myself."<p>"Okay..." Kim kept her face turned away from Ranma-chan so the redhead wouldn't see the pout on her face. Her first outing with Ranko hadn't exactly been the best, in fact, they had barely said a word to each other after lunch. They had hit one of the local malls and went window shopping, but kept their opinions to themselves. Ranma did so because she wasn't exactly the most versed in women's apperal, and always went for nessessity than fashion. Kim, on the other hand, was silent because Ranma was silent, and thought she was still holding a grudge for the 'dump' comment earlier. Kim decided that it was best to cut her losses, and not waste the other woman's time with her; it was a big city, she could surely find other friends.<p>"You want me to ride with you? It's not that far from my place."<p>"Uh, no, no thanks, I wouldn't want to inconvenience you,"<p>"It's not a problem, I'm not doing anything else right..." Ranma blinked, as her cellphone went off, "Hold on a sec, Hello?" The redhead's face bunched up, and then she let out a sigh. "Alright, I'll meet you back at my place in a half hour."<p>"Ranma?" Kim asked, curiously.<p>"Huh?" Ranma-chan asked, looking up at the other woman, forgetting her name was 'Ranko' at the moment.<p>"Ranma, that was Ranma wanting you to come home?"<p>"Ranma?" the redhead asked, still confused. Her eyes lit up in realization, "Oh! Yeah, that was my husband, he wants me home toooo... cook dinner, that's it!"<p>"Hmm? I thought Ranma knew how to cook himself?"<p>"Oh? Oh! He does, it's just, well, he prefers me to cook. Women's work and all that..." the pigtailed woman chuckled nervously, while scratching the back of her head.<p>Kim got a hard look in her eyes, "Did he tell you this?"<p>"Um, uh... no?" Ranma-chan was finding it difficult to keep track of her own lie now, and felt it crashing onto the top of her head.<p>Kim sighed, but her eyes remained hard and penetrating, "Well, you don't want to keep him waiting now, do we?"<p>"Nope, we better get going quickly, don't want to keep him from his dinner," the shorter woman said briskly.<p>"I'm keeping you two on call for the time being," Richter started, while pruning one of the dangling strawberry vines in his office, "You two are best for this, and I do not want any mishaps on this assignment."<p>"Of course, sir," Ranma replied respectfully.<p>"I won't go into the details of why this assignment is vital, I just request that you ensure that this assassin is stopped. I will pay you handsomely for this, coupled with any rewards that the other houses are compiling for this person's head. I would dare suggest you two could retire and live well for even a few generations after this, when you succeed."<p>"We'll get the job done, just because you asked us to," Rugar replied simply, earning a nod in his direction from Richter Stromhaus.<p>"Of course, but the extra incentive should help your moral, I would think."<p>"It does for me," Ranma stated, and then sweated as Dan and Richter focused on him with expresionless faces, "um, sir."<p>Richter shrugged it off, and dismissed the two from his office, wishing them luck as they departed.<p>"Dan..." Ranma started calmly.<p>"Yeah."<p>"How did I end up wet?" Dan motioned to the empty beer mug that was laying on its side by Ranma-chan, "Okay, and how did we end up *here* again?"<p>"The republic voted so," Dan replied, not turning away from the topless girl slithering all over the floor.<p>Ranma narrowed her eyes at her partner, "You actually get off on this, don't you?"<p>"Now Sis, that's just disgusting! Can't big brother just share his joys with his favorite sibling?"<p>"You freaking pervert!" Ranma-chan almost screeched, and then stood up, "I'll take the damn bus home."<p>Rugar caught her, and sat the woman back down, "No, you're staying. Richter has us on call tonight... ALL night, until he says otherwise. So I suggest you sit here, and pass time."<p>Ranma attempted to sulk, she really did. At least the beer in her lap would go a ways to explain her wetspot this time. Out of the corner of her eye, she noted Dan acting skittish, glancing around every so often. The pigtailed woman had noticed he was doing this every since she met him at her apartment, and wondered what had him spooked. Thus, she also started subtly scanning the club, which lead to her noting the approach of one unsavory type.<p>"Oh, shit," Dan mumbled, not missing the bald man wearing a blue-gray business suit. The guy was a notorious sleeze, but he was a big notorious sleeze. Nun Guao was one of the heads of the city; though not very powerful, not someone they wanted to start up with. Dan, being the vetran, knew all this. Ranma, being the newbie, on the other hand...<p>"Hey, little dyke, I got a few notes myself, hows about you pick from any one of those girls up there, and you two can come back to my mansion and put on a show?" Nobody had realized anything had happened, until Ranma powerbombed him through a table. Even Dan had to be impressed with the speed that Ranma had managed that; the guy was rather heavy set.<p>Of course, Guao's three bodyguards went into action. The first one to Ranma's right drew his gun, and the redhead reached for it, and prevented the trigger from being pulled. The redhead then threw a side kick to the one on her left, sending him into a table. The third man pulled out an extending baton, and swung it at Ranma-chan's face. She bent backwards, still wrenching the guy with the gun's hand, and gave a push kick to the bodyguard that was right in front of her. Before she turned her attentions to the guy on her right...<p>"Ra-Ranko?"<p>Ranma-chan froze, and looked to the stripper that was standing at the end of the runway, looking at her in shock.
