</div>Ranma 1/2<br/>Easy Target Part 2; Dirty Shot<br/>Part 3<p>Ranma had easily cycled through her admittadly limited vocabulary of swear words she could apply to her partner. Dan knew that she had vowed to live alone, though she would not give him the reasons why, yet he continued to torment her in such a manner.<p>You just don't mess with a lonely guy's mind like that, it's just not right.<p>As it was, Ranma's fustration only compiled when the hot water for her shower had suddenly gone out, leaving her female. The redhead quickly skipped out of the shower to escape the sudden cold blast, and decided that she was just too exhausted to bother heating up water on the apartment stove. Instead, she ventured into her room to sleep.<p>For a good hour or so, Ranma-chan twisted and turned in bed, and found ignoring her... condition impossible. With a growl of fustration and submission, the redhead grabbed the magazine on her nightstand roughtly, undid her robe, and found a new set of swear words describe Rugar while she attempted to... unwind.<p>Ranma awoke with her robe haphazardly splayed about her to the knocking on her apartment door. Using her new extended swearing vocabulary, she adjusted her robe and quickly rushed for the door.<p>Rugar found the door opened by a baggy-eyed redhead who's hair was mangled at best. She hadn't done a good job of fixing her robe before she got to the door. "Hard time sleeping?" Dan asked with an honest concern in his voice. The redheaded man's eyes rolled up to his forehead, where he found the barrel of a Colt M1911 pressed against it.<p>Ranma-chan had her left forearm braced against the door frame, while her right hand held the gun to her soon-to-be deceased partner's forehead, "I told you last night I was going to kill you, didn't I?"<p>"Yeah, I learned to take it with a grain of salt," The older man replied casually.<p>"I mean it this time, Dan," Ranma's eyes narrowed as her lips pursed.<p>Dan tilted his head slightly as to not jolt the gun and bring about his untimely demise, "Morning hormones?"<p>::CL-ICK::<p>"You think this is really funny, do you?" Ranma-chan growled, after cocking back the hammer.<p>"You seemed stressed," Dan apparently didn't have life preservation on the forefront of his mind.<p>"Three... damn... hours," Ranma replied evenly, "It took me three hours to get to sleep."<p>"Mirror still on the ceiling?" Rugar quickly brought a thin stack of notes, and trapped it between the hammer and the base as Ranma pulled the trigger, "Here's your pay for last night, by the way."<p>Ranma glared at her partner, and removed the money from the gun. Dan flinched, as the hammer fully collapsed, but not with enough force to set off the bullet. The redhead counted the money, and glared once again at Rugar.<p>"Hey, I couldn't jam the hammer with any more," Dan replied with a smirk, and handed his partner the rest of what she was owed.<p>"Now get the Hell out of here," Ranma growled, moving to slam the door.<p>"I'll do that," Dan replied, turning to leave. Before he took a step, he looked back over his shoulder, "Oh, and take a shower, you smell musky as Hell!"<p>Dan ran like his life depended on it, probably because it did.<p>Ranma came back into her apartment after chasing her partner out of the building, and went to make herself breakfast. The redhead gave a disgusted groan when she found things scarce; as a lot of it had gone bad. She didn't realize that she was so low on foodstuffs.<p>"Guess I'll be shopping today," Ranma groaned, not relishing her least favorite task of living on her lonesome. She went to the shower to take Dan's advice (not that she did it because of his taunting, of course not), and once back to a guy, got herself dressed in a red and black hensly shirt that was color divided diagonally with the top half being black and the bottom half being red, along with black khaki slacks and black socks. He put on some red casual sneakers, and checked to ensure his extending batan was secure in the back of his pants. In the few months or so he had been working with Rugar, and even before that as a bodyguard, Ranma had garnered his fair share of enemies in both forms, and found that though carrying a gun around wasn't the most prudent thing to do in Korea, at least he should keep himself armed somehow.<p>Once fully dressed, Ranma was ready to go.<p>The man wearing a kamikaze headband and man's kimono, sitting in lotus position on a ricestalk tatami mat read the report that his advisor had brought him. A hit separate from the mass one made earlier yesterday was brought to his attention. It wouldn't have been a big deal to him, in fact, he rather hated the guy who was offed. The problem was with all these hits suddenly happening to the citie's organized underworld, a power vacuum was going to be generated. If something like that were to happen, the sudden bid by all the remaining heads would tear the city apart. He called for his advisor to return shortly after he finished breakfast, and told him to contact his associates for a meeting.<p>Ranma scoured the produce section of his local supermarket for his usual supplies. He stopped in front of the bok chow to select one of the leafy vegetables, and didn't pay any mind to the Korean woman who was looking at him with a timid expression. She seemed to be firming her resolve, and approached the young man who was looking for a satisfactory bundle of the vegetable.<p>"You must be a good cook, I mean... since you're looking so hard... I mean."<p>"Hmm?" Ranma turned to see a rather lovely looking woman of about his age and height with hair that reached the middle of her back wearing a baby blue turtleneck sweater and jeans. Even the sweater didn't hide her endowments well, and Ranma mentally found himself comparing his cursed form's assets to the ones before him. Not the first time or last time Ranma would curse his late-developing hormones.<p>The woman didn't notice to where his gaze had traveled to, and bowed as she introduced herself, "My name is Mae Hyun Kim."<p>Ranma smiled in reply, and bowed courteously, while inside he was grimacing. He noticed the woman's nervous and slightly shaky voice, her over polite mannerisms, and the way she presented herself before him. She was on the prowl, and he was the lunchmeat with the sign sticking out of it that read 'Here, Kitty kitty'.<p>He hated to always do this, but he couldn't let anyone find out about his curse here when it wasn't nessisary, "I'm Ranma Saotome... and I'm kinda married, I'm afraid." Well, it was kind of the truth.<p>The woman's eyes went wide as she noticed his ring. She stepped back quickly, and started to bow profusely while apologising for making a fool of herself. Ranma nervously looked around at the people who stopped to stare, and chuckled, chagrinned. He bowed down to tell the girl that it was okay, when she came up quickly, and smacked the back of her head into his right eye.<p>"OW! GEEZ!" Ranma shouted covering his eye. Kim noticed what she did, and baulked. She offered to help him by pulling out a steak he had in his cart and offering to hold it over his eye.<p>Kim was doing her novel best to keep from breaking down. She had been looking at the man named Ranma's shopping cart, and noted that he was shopping like a bachelor, she didn't realize that he could be shopping for himself because his wife may be away for the time being or something.<p>"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm such a clutz," the woman wimpered, trying to get Ranma to lift his head up so she could put the steak over it.<p>"Watch out, you crazy..." Ranma turned to shout, and with his good eye, saw the woman's bottom lip trembling understress, while her eyes were watering. The ponytailed man mentally swore at himself for succombing to the one weakness he seemed he could never purge himself of, "Hey, it's not that bad, alright, it's just gonna swell a bit."<p>"I... I didn't, I'm just such a clutz, and you looked like you may be a nice guy... and..."<p>Ranma looked back with an expression of mirth, "You're new in town, aren't you?"<p>"Uh, yeah," Kim replied, "I came here for college, and I don't know many people here. I just, well..."<p>Ranma put his free hand up to forstall any more, "Look, I'm pretty new around here myself, so I know how it is."<p>"Yes, but you at least have your wife," Kim replied softly, almost to the point where Ranma couldn't hear her. The young man tilted his head, as an idea came to him.<p>"You know? My wife doesn't know anybody here either. She has her own job, but I don't get to see her often when she's not working... I'll tell you what," Ranma pulled out a piece of paper, and asked Kim for a pen. She reached into her purse and supplied one.<p>"Here, this is my... our home phone number. Why don't you give us a call? I'm pretty sure she'll be glad to hear from you!"<p>Kim blinked away some of her tears, and formed a genuine smile that Ranma had to flinch at; the woman was definitely a beauty that was going to haunt his restless nights. Personal vows of celibecy *really* suck.<p>"I... I don't know what to say," she replied, gratefully.<p>Ranma nodded his head, "Don't mention it, someone as cute as you shouldn't be crying. You won't catch a boyfriend if your face is all tear streaked and stuff."<p>Kim nodded, and checked her watch, "Um, it was nice to meet you, I gotta get going for an interview myself, I'll call as soon as possible! I promise!" With that, Kim bowed again, and rushed to the checkout line. Ranma had to sigh, the girl had some serious confidence problems that he was going to have to work on. It suddenly struck him; he now possibly had a friend that existed outside of work.
