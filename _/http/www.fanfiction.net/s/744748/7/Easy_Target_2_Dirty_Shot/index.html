</div>Ranma<br/>Easy Target 2; Dirty Shot<br/>Part 7<p>"Ranko?" Rugar mumbled, slightly confused, and then shrugged it off as he took another chug of his beer.<p>"You're fucking dead, bitch!" the third bodyguard with the baton cried out as he pulled himself to standing. Ranma looked back towards him, and rolled herself back onto stage; parrying his verticle swing with her feet. The guy with the gun cried out, as his hand was wretched even further, and Ranma-chan swept her left foot into the back of the bodyguard's head, flipping him over and causing him to release the gun. Ranma continued to turn to her right from the sweep, and placed her hands against the ground with her left knee. She then gave a back thrust kick to the guy with the baton, causing his own weapon to connect with his head as he was pulling it back. Dan continued to sip his beer, as he stuck his foot out, causing the staggering man to trip.<p>The second guard that was pulling himself from the table charged from Ranma-chan's right. She swung her right leg under her, and used it to launch herself over the aggressing man, rolling horizontally over his back as she did so. When she landed, she punted him between the legs, causing him to double over, and then leapt onto his head; using her butt to slam it into the runway floor.<p>Nun Guao managed to recover by this point, "THE BITCH ON STAGE, SHE KNOWS HER! GET HER!"<p>Kim was still frozen in shock and fear; shock from seeing her new friend hand the asses of a few gangsters back to them, and fear that it was happening in front of her. She screeched, when the guy once holding the gun climbed on stage and advanced on her. The redhead saw this, and leapt to her feet, and rushed towards Kim.<p>"KIM DUCK!" The Korean woman had enough coherance to obey, just as Ranma leapt over her in a horizontal roll, kicking the bodyguard in the side of his face with her left foot. As he staggered, she landedon her left foot, and wrapped her right leg around the side of his neck. She then twisted into the air, sending the man flying off stage, and into another table.<p>"YOU WORTHLESS FUCKS! KILL THE BI-..."<p>"You mind? You're ruining the show," Dan said calmly, pointing the tip of his dagger against the base of Nun Guao's chin. The gangster carefully lifted his chin from it, and backed away with a malicious look, "Oh, and if you think of any retaliation, keep in mind she's one of Richter's employees."<p>Guao got the point, and begrudgingly called his men to head out with him. Ranma-chan came out of stance, still anticipating on defending Kim, and then put an arm around her and lead her to the back. The other concerned strippers gave way to the two as they made it back to the dressing room.<p>Once Ranma and Kim were seated, the redhead turned to her friend, "Hey, you okay?" When Kim didn't respond, Ranma reached over and lightly shook her shoulder, "Hey, Kim, you're okay now. You have nothing to worry about now... Kim?"<p>The pigtailed woman suddenly jolted, as the nearly bare flesh of her Korean friend was suddenly pressed against her tightly. Akwardly, Ranma-chan reached around and hugged her sobbing friend, sighing at both the tears falling onto her neck, and the moistness that was building up... down there. Kim sure felt nice against her...<p>"He... h-he..." Kim sobbed, unaware of the sensations she was sending off in her new friend.<p>"Hey, it's okay, they won't bother you again, okay? I promise," the redhead said solomnly, while rubbing the other woman's shoulderblades.<p>"Watch out, step aside. Hey, you ain't got anything I hadn't already seen out there... okay, I hadn't seen that before..." Ranma looked over Kim's shoulder to see Rugar walk in, "Ranma, we gotta get going. Takeo's being hit."<p>Ranma shot to standing, while carefully attempting not to jostle her distraught friend. The redhead looked over to one of the strippers standing by, "Um, can you make sure she's okay? I... gotta go." The woman nodded, and came to Kim's aid. Ranma and Dan quickly shot out the back exit.<p>"Takeo's isn't far from here, about three miles north," Dan loudly stated, rushing for his car.<p>"Gotcha, you get the car there, I'll get there ahead of you," Ranma-chan leapt backwards into a flip onto the club's roof, and then in a massive leap, leapt to another rooftop heading north. Dan was left slightly shocked at the feat, despite having seen Ranma perform that before, and rushed for his car.<p>Oyabun Takeo sat in lotus position still, not allowing the sounds of conflict beyond his doors disturb his meditation. Suddenly, his chamber doors swung open, and a fwooshing sound came from it. In a flash of steel, Takeo was standing with his long katana at ready; a dagger dripping some clear fluid penetrating the wall to the side of him.<p>"You will find me a much more difficult advisary than you intended," the crime boss stated solomnly. The man in black simply removed his sword from his back, and leapt for the attack...<p>Ranma reached the gates of Takeo's estate and warehouse, and without hesistation, leapt over it. The redhead ignored the shouts of halt after her, and ran inside. A crowd of Takeo's men suddenly blocked her way, causing the redhead to grit her teeth, "Get out of my way, I don't have time for this!" Unfortunately, they weren't listening...<p>Takeo and the assassin traded sword strikes furiously at an astonishing pace. Takeo parried a slash that came from down and to his left with his sword held vertically upside down against his left arm, and then swung it around and down towards his opponent's head. The assassin torqued his sword into a high guard, and blocked it. Continuing the flow, the man in black brought his sword to his high left and down towards the crime boss's neck. Takeo swung his sword to his right with his right hand, striking against the other sword. As soon as it connected, he brought his left hand against the back of the blade's tip, and forced it towards his assassin's neck, overpowering his guard at the same time.<p>The assassin staggered back from the deep cut in his neck, and chuckled, "Nice, I most assuradly had not expected your level of skill."<p>Takeo narrowed his eyes, "You're accent, British?"<p>The man in black didn't answer, instead choosing to renew the battle with a wide one handed horizontal slash from his left to his right. Takeo jumped back, and dashed forward with a piercing stab that penetrated his opponent's stomach while ducking the slash back ment to sever his head from his neck, but the telling blow was ignored. The assassin slapped the blade penetrating his stomach away with his left hand, and gave shocked Takeo a front kick that sent him flying onto his back.<p>The assassin stomped forward, and stabbed down at his target. Takeo rolled out of the way to his right and to kneeling position, and as his opponent was still overbalanced, delivered a crossing slash past the assassin's abdomen. The man in black staggered backwards again, and suddenly attempted another overhead slash with both hands.<p>Takeo blocked the blow with a high guard while launching to his feet, and shoulder rammed his opponent. As the assassin was once again off balance, Takeo delivered three fatal blows; one to the neck, one to the chest, and a final one across the abdomen area once again.<p>"FALL, DAMN YOU!" the crime boss commanded, as his blows were not even drawing blood. He wondered if this were some type of armor or if his opponent was even human; both notions beginning to fuel his nervousness.<p>Ranma burst into the room, still holding one of Takeo's guards in a headlock, "TAKEO!"<p>The break in concentration was all his opponent needed, and a slash across the crime boss's chest ended the fight. Ranma quickly pulled her guns and started to fire, as Takeo fell to the side. The assassin parried the bullets skillfully with his sword, only allowing a few to get by and strike him.<p>Ranma-chan growled at her weapon's ineffectiveness, and rushed towards the man in black for hand to hand combat. She ducked a sword swing aimed for her chest, and slid into a kick towards the man's knees. As he toppled forward, she placed her feet under his rib cage, and thrust him backwards into the air. The assassin landed on his back, and immidiately kicked himself up and took off running; his task was complete, so there was no need to stay around.<p>Ranma was about to take off, when she was stopped by Takeo's hand on her leg, "Blowfish toxin... antidote... top drawer." Ranma-chan looked to where the man was pointing, and back towards where her query had ran off to. It didn't take Ranma even a quick moment of contemplation as she made her decision.<p>The assassin swung open the front door, and found himself bumrushed by a large and stout redheaded man. The man in black rolled his tackler into a tomoe throw, and then sprang to his feet. He unsheethed his sword, and swung backwards, just barely missing Rugar's face. The hitman quickly unsheathed his dagger guns from his back holsters, and launched at his opponent. Both dagger guns were skillfully blocked with one parry, causing the two to lock up.<p>"Hello Daniel, how are the wife and children?" The man in black asked in a callous, emotionless, and infinitely cold voice, "Don't you want to ask me the same?"<p>Dan's face lost all pigmentation...
