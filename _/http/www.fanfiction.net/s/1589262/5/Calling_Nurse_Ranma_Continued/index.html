</div><p>Chapter 5</p><p>AN:  Guess who's healthy again. I'm sorry for making you all wait so long. But fear  not, I am back and writing. Hope you enjoy.</p><p>*words*  Are thoughts</p><p>Ranma  sat cross-legged in his room. He was deep in thought. A footstep behind him  caught his attention.</p><p>"I  heard what you did to Ryoga. Care to talk about it?" Genma asked. He sat down  beside his son.</p><p>"There's  nothing to talk about pop. He stepped over the line. I snapped and lost  control." Ranma said quietly.</p><p>"Ranma  my boy, I've seen you get plenty angry with Ryoga on many occasion, but not  even you have the audacity to beat him up that bad. What's wrong?" Genma asked  cautiously.</p><p>"Damnit  pop, why can't you just leave me alone?" Ranma asked, turning from him.</p><p>"It's  Akane, isn't it boy." He said. Ranma's breath caught in his throat and Genma  knew he had struck gold. "I know how you feel about her. I've known for a while  now. But does she know?" Ranma sighed and turned around.</p><p>"That's  what's wrong pop. I can't tell her. You see how she acts around me. She hates  me." He said his gaze lowering.</p><p>"Does  she? No one understands why a woman does the things she does, but sometimes she  says things she doesn't mean. How is it that boy puts it? Me thinks she doth  protest too much?" Genma said, his face serious. Ranma half-grinned.</p><p>"Kuno.  What a moron. Though some of the things he says do make sense. And I guess she  does have a right to be mad. Though it's not like it's my fault." Ranma said.  He then stood up.</p><p>"Where  are you going boy?" Genma asked. Ranma flashed him his special smile. Genma  knew Ranma was going to try again. He walked down to Akane's room, and then  paused. What would he say? How would he say it? He knew he had to, but it was  so damn hard. He turned the knob and opened the door.</p><p>"Akane  I…" He froze like dear in the headlights. There she was, changing into a new  pair of pajamas, nude from the waist up.</p><p>"YOU  PERVERT!" The whole household looked up towards her room as the sickening  crunch of jaw, the explosion of window, and the trademark "I'm sorry" of Ranma  as he flew off into the distance.</p><p>"Honestly!"  Akane huffed, lying back down in her bed. She had needed to change out of her  old pajamas since they were coated with sweat and were making her chilly. She  put her arm over her forehead to try and block out some of the light from  outside. It was hurting her eyes, which made her head hurt. However the breeze  from the newly opened window felt nice. She heard a soft knock on the door and  sighed. If it was Ranma…</p><p>"Akane?  Can I come in?" Soun asked. Akane's eyes opened and she coughed.</p><p>"Yeah  dad, come in." She croaked. The door opened and Mr. Tendo stood there looking  solemn.</p><p>"I  take it you just had another fight?" Soun asked. Akane growled.</p><p>"That  pervert walked in on me again. He keeps looking at me when I'm undressed." She  huffed.</p><p>"Akane,  do you know why he came to see you?" Soun asked. Akane looked up at him  confused.</p><p>"N-no.  I just saw him staring at me and I lost it. I never gave him time to explain."  She said, realizing she had lost her temper again. She heard voices from the  hall and recognized Dr. Tofu's voice. "Why's Dr. Tofu here? Is he here to check  up on me?"</p><p>"No  actually. He's here to check on Ryoga. He and Ranma had a fight." Soun said.  Akane growled.</p><p>"I've  told him not to bully him. Why are they always fighting?" She asked.</p><p>"It  was his own fault this time sis." Nabiki said from the doorway.</p><p>"Nabiki?"  Akane asked, sitting up and looking at her sister.</p><p>"Ranma's  having a rough time right now. We were talking when Ryoga butted in. Ranma  tried to calm him down, but as usual he had to fight. I don't blame Ranma for  doing this. I'm actually surprised he didn't kill the guy. I know I would have,  if I felt as bad as he does." She said. Akane got confused.</p><p>"What's  he got to be upset about?" Akane asked, her temper rising. Nabiki shook her  head.</p><p>"It's  not my place to say sis. Nor is it yours, daddy." Nabiki said, shooting a look  at Soun. He nodded.</p><p>"She's  right Akane. Why don't you ask Ranma when he gets back?" He said before leaving  the room. Akane sighed and put her chin on her knees.</p><p>"Ranma's  upset because of me? So what did he come to tell me? Stupid jerk." She said,  rolling over. She attempted to go back to sleep, but found she couldn't get her  fiancé off her mind.</p><p>Ukyo  struggled with the large sack as she moved towards the alley. A heavy rain had  started and her clothes were already soaked through.</p><p>"Why  couldn't it have waited two more minutes to rain? I hate taking out the garbage  in weather like this." She grumbled. She noticed a soft whimpering further down  the alley and got curious. She walked slowly towards the sound. When she saw a  familiar head of red hair, she stopped short.</p><p>"Ranma-honey?  Is that you?" She asked. Ranma didn't respond at first. She just sat there, in  the rain.</p><p>"Hey,  come on sugar. You're gonna catch your death in this weather. Come inside."  Ukyo said, moving closer. It was then she noticed that Ranma was trying to hide  her face. "Hey are you crying?"</p><p>"I  aint doin no such thing. It's just I got something in my eye." She said. Ukyo  sighed. Even in his female form he was too stubborn to admit when he, or rather  she, was crying.</p><p>"Come  inside silly. I'll get you something to eat and warm you up." She said. Ranma  finally stood and followed her inside. Ukyo quickly fired up her grill, and  started mixing ingredients. Within moments, she had Ranma's favorite recipe  cooked up and served. But Ranma didn't even budge.</p><p>"Okay  sugar. I just offered you a free meal and you didn't even blink. I know  something's wrong." Ukyo stated. Ranma looked at her plate for a few moments  before speaking.</p><p>"I  don't know what to do Ukyo. I've had these feelings inside for so long, but I  can't seem to do anything about it. Every time I try to say them, they get  pushed further down and I say something stupid." Ranma said. Ukyo blushed a  deep crimson.</p><p>"Well  I uh… I'm not sure what to say Ran-chan. I didn't know you felt this way." She  scratched the back of her neck, surprised by Ranma's words.</p><p>"I  can finally admit it to my self, but I just can't bring myself to tell her."  Ranma said. Ukyo's breath caught in her throat.</p><p>"H-her?"  She asked. Ukyo could feel her heart begin to pull at her chest.</p><p>"But  it doesn't matter because she hates me." She said. She had said it so quietly,  Ukyo had barely heard.</p><p>"Who  hates you?" Ukyo asked. She already knew the answer. Had the war finally ended?  Had Ranma finally made his choice? She grabbed the kettle that was ready and  poured it onto Ranma. Instead of answering, he just sighed and lowered his head  into his hands. Ukyo moved from behind the counted to stand beside her fiancé.</p><p>"Hey  sugar, I'm sure it's not all that bad." She said. *What the hell am I doing? If  he breaks up with her then he's free to be with me! But why do I feel so bad  for him?* Ukyo couldn't figure out why she wanted to help him. She knew that  there was no way she could have him as long as he was with Akane, but for some  reason, she knew he had already devoted his heart to her. That meant they could  never be what she really wanted them to be. She heard a knock at the door and  initially ignored it. That is until it became a constant thumping.</p><p>"Hey,  we're closed alright? Come back tomorrow!" Ukyo yelled at the door. But the  banging only got more insistent. Ukyo growled and stormed over to the door. She  threw it open ready to beat on the intended interruption, but her face froze  when she saw whom it was.</p><p>"I'm  sorry to bother you, but is Ranma here?" She asked. Ukyo nodded and stepped  aside. The woman walked over to Ranma and placed her hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"Dearest  son, I heard everything from that husband of mine. Would you like to talk?" She  asked. Ranma stiffened at the voice.</p><p>"Mom?"  Ranma asked. Nodoka sat down beside him.</p><p>"I  know you're having it tough right now, but please don't give up. She loves you,  I know she does, she just has the same problem you do. She can't admit it to  you, or herself yet. But the time will come." She said. A faint hint of a  glimmer passed Ranma's eyes.</p><p>"Gee  you think so?" Ranma asked. Nodoka nodded and Ranma sat up and sighed. "So what  do I do about telling her how I feel?" Nodoka just smiled.</p><p>"You'll  find a way my son." She said.</p>
