</div><p>AN: Dear  Readers. This fanfic originally belongs to 'Penguine'. I had been following it  for a while, but finally got an update informing us all that she no longer  wished to continue this fic. So after a brief convo with her, she has agreed to  let me finish it, as it were. The first two chapters are hers, with some minor  grammar and information fixes. I will try to stay in sync with her writing  style and the way she's set the story so far. If you have any questions, feel  free to e-mail me. Now on to the story.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Akane sighed as she entered the study hall and found a seat. After  settling herself in, she slumped her head down on her arms on the desk. This  headache was simply not going away. On top of that, she was now starting to  feel dizzy and sick to her stomach. Her body shivered. Add extremely cold to  that list. She grumbled curses at that heating/air system that the school was  always having problems with. Thought slowly slipped out of Akane's mind and  within a couple of minutes of having sat down, she was fast asleep.</p><p>Ranma bounced into the study hall, happy as a lark. For once, he was having an  absolutely perfect day. He'd discovered he'd gotten a 90 on his biology  midterm. In geography, they'd had a party to celebrate the teacher's birthday.  How much better could the day get? Ranma was so caught up in his musings that  it was only when he'd sat down and turned to glance around the room that he  noticed Akane asleep at her desk with her short black hair obscuring her face.</p><p>The boy frowned. It wasn't like Akane to fall asleep just like that. Braving  possible retaliation from the hot-tempered girl, Ranma rose from his seat and  stepped over to see what was wrong. He called her name, but got no response.  Now definitely worried, Ranma knelt down and brushed her hair out of her face.  It was then that he noticed the redness in her cheeks in contrast to the  extremely pale complexion of the rest of her face as well as how incredibly  warm her skin was to the touch. This girl was most definitely sick.</p><p>Ranma sighed. 'There goes my good day,' he thought to himself as he rose and  went to find the study hall monitor. After having explained the situation to  the monitor, then the principle, dodging a haircut in the process, Ranma finally  got clearance to take Akane home and returned to her side.</p><p>Kneeling back down again, Ranma gently shook the girl in an attempt to wake  her. Akane let out a small whimper but did not awaken. Ranma finally sighed and  opted for a different approach. Some how, amazingly, he managed to fit Akane's  bag inside his own. Then he flung his satchel onto his back. Kneeling once  more, he swooped the slumbering tomboy up into his arms. Rising back to his  feet with ease, he carried her out of the room then out of the building, never  once paying attention to the stares he was getting. The only thing on his mind  at the moment was getting Akane well.</p><p>Akane awoke and furrowed her brow in confusion, not recognizing where she was  at first. Then Dr. Tofu's face popped into her vision, "Ahh… I see we are  awake. How are you feeling, Akane?"</p><p>"Awful," the girl answered in all honesty. Akane double blinked in confusion  then finally remembered feeling sick as she'd entered study hall and sat down.  She must have fallen asleep. But, then how did she get to the clinic? She  groaned and sat up to look around. As she did, she found Ranma standing there  beside Dr. Tofu trying his best, and failing miserably, to hide the worry from  his face. "Ranma! You pervert! Taking me out of school without even waking me  up, let alone ASKING me!" she growled in a sudden surge of anger. However, her  face then turned green as she was instantly rewarded with a strong wave of  nausea. "I think… I'm gonna be sick," she whispered. The words were barely out  of her mouth before Dr. Tofu shoved a barf bucket into her lap just in time to  catch the imminent upchuck.</p><p>"Number one, I'm not a pervert. Number two, I <i>tried</i> to wake you up but  you wouldn't. Number three, there's no way in hell I was going to let you stay  there as sick as you are," Ranma fussed back.</p><p>"Ranma's right, Akane. You need to go home and rest. You have the flu and it  will take a few days to go away, if not a full week. I'm going to send you home  with Ranma along with some things that will help ease your symptoms. You're  going to need to drink plenty of fluids and, most importantly, rest. Also, you  should eat a little something, some crackers or a small bowl of rice every  couple of hours to keep some nourishment in you. Stay away from dairy products  for a little while, and don't worry if what you eat doesn't always stay down.  As long as you keep eating just a little bit and frequently, you shouldn't have  too much of a problem. Keep on the meds as directed and do as I have said, and  you should be better soon. Don't worry about school. I'll give them a call and  let them know that you will be absent for the week," Dr. Tofu explained gently  but yet with an air of seriousness. Akane frowned then bowed her head in  defeat.</p><p>"Yes, sir," she said softly. She made a wince as her headache came back and  sent the room spinning. Dr. Tofu frowned, turning around and walking across the  room for a moment before returning with a cup of special tea in his hands.</p><p>"Here, drink this. It will make you feel a little better and help you to rest,"  the young doctor instructed. Akane frowned but did as she was told. After a  moment, she passed the empty cup back to Dr. Tofu.</p><p>"All right, for now, I'm going to send you two home. I'll send the medications  home with Ranma's father when he gets back from running some errands for me,"  Dr. Tofu said. Akane immediately swiveled on the patient mat, swinging her legs  over the edge before attempting to stand. As she stood, she felt her muscles  ache and her head start swimming again. Next thing she knew, she was in Ranma's  arms.</p><p>"You idiot!" she growled, fighting to keep the blush from her cheeks.</p><p>"You really should be taking better care of yourself right now, Akane," Ranma  answered smoothly.</p><p>"Shut up, moron! I didn't ask to be carried <i>again</i>, and I certainly  didn't ask for your opinion," Akane shot back.</p><p>"I'm carrying you whether you like it or not, Akane. So just shut up and deal  with it for once," Ranma said as he sat her back down on the mat long enough to  sling his book bag onto his back. That done, he swiftly picked her back up, bid  thanks and farewell to Dr. Tofu, then stepped out of the clinic with Akane only  shooting him a glare and biting her tongue.</p><p>Ranma walked down the sidewalk, carrying Akane with complete silence between  the two of them. As they went, Akane made a face at a weird sound she heard.  Then she realized it was Ranma's strong heartbeat as her ear was so close to  his chest. The sound left her surprisingly mesmerized. Lulled by the sound of  Ranma's heartbeat as well as the effects of the tea she'd drank, it was only  minutes before Akane fell back into a sound sleep, snuggled in the warm arms  that carried her.</p><p>Sensing the tension ease from the body of the young girl in his arms, Ranma  blinked and looked down at her. Akane's body relaxed, and her breathing became  deep and steady. As he watched her slip into a deep peaceful sleep, Ranma knew  that he was safe to take of his emotional mask for a while and allowed himself  to smile softly. The girl was a beast when she was awake, but when she slept,  she was the most beautiful thing he'd ever laid eyes on.</p><p>Finally reaching the Tendo estate, Ranma turned and carried Akane into the  house. Wasting no time, he immediately headed for his fiancé's room. P-chan  glared at him from the bed, being a little pissed that Ranma had woken him up.  But then his eyes went wide as he noticed Ranma was <i>carrying</i> Akane, who  was obviously asleep or something, into the room. Ranma growled at the pig.</p><p>"Ryoga, get down from there, then get the hell out of here unless you want to  catch the flu from Akane!" Ranma hissed in a tone that left absolutely no room  for argument, lest the pig get seriously pounded. Kasumi, who'd been walking by  in the hallway, stopped in the doorway just in time to catch the part of  Ranma's words about Akane having the flu.</p><p>"Oh my! Come here, P-chan. Let's leave Akane alone for a while. Ranma, have you  taken her to see Tofu yet?" Kasumi asked while coaxing the pig to come to her.  The pig looked at her, took one more look at a Ranma that menacingly dared him  to stay with the look in his eyes, then, for once, wisely scrambled for Kasumi  as fast as his little feet could carry him. Kasumi bent and picked him up while  Ranma gently laid Akane in her bed, tucking her in.</p><p>"Yes. I took her there immediately after I got her out of school. She just has  the flu, and it will have to run its course. Pop is suppose to bring the  medicine home with him some time soon," Ranma answered as he stood back up and  turned around to face Kasumi. "He's calling school and excusing her for the  week so that she can stay home and rest."</p><p>"All right," Kasumi nodded. Ranma brushed passed her and out of the room to  return a minute later in girl form with a bowl and a wet wash cloth. She  returned to Akane's bedside and lowered to her knees. After folding the cool  wet cloth, she reached out and placed it upon Akane's forehead. She then placed  the bowl at Akane's side should she awaken and need it.</p><p>Ranma watched the slumbering girl for a moment before a twinkle appeared in her  eye as an idea came to mind. She rose to her feet and walked out of the room,  "Kasumi, keep an eye on her for a few minutes for me. I'll be back."</p><p>Finally realizing she still had that heavy school bag on her back, Ranma dumped  the article off in her room then turned and walked out of the house to the  curious onlook of Kasumi and P-chan. Kasumi sighed with a soft smile, "He can  be really sweet to her when he really wants to. Let's go fix some lunch, hmm  P-chan?" With that Kasumi shut Akane's door partway then left for the kitchen  with the frustrated pig sitting still in her arms.</p><p>Upon returning, Ranma first found some hot water to change back into his true  form again, then he made his way to Akane's room after peeking in the kitchen  to check in with Kasumi. His bare feet softly slapping against the hardwood  floors, Ranma reached Akane's room and slipped through the door, closing it  most of the way behind him. Once inside, he stepped back over to gently sit  down on Akane's bedside. He brought forth the cute little tan teddy bear he'd  just bought and carefully slipped it through her arms, trying his best not to  wake her. Akane stirred only enough to hug the bear as she snuggled under the  covers. After only a moment, she relaxed again while hugging the new bear  possessively. Smiling softly, Ranma allowed himself to lean over and kiss her  cheek before rising and settling on the floor. Leaning back against the desk,  he pulled out a new Star Wars novel he'd picked up while he was out buying that  teddy bear for Akane. With one more glance to the sleeping girl, Ranma opened  his new book and immersed his mind in its pages.</p><p>A little while later, a stray sound caused Ranma to look up from his book. A  moment later, a soft knock came to the door before Mr. Tendo poked his head in  then opened the door to reveal Genma standing with him. Ranma elephant eared  the page he was on and plopped his book closed in his lap as he looked up at  the two men passively.</p><p>"How is she?" Soun asked softly.</p><p>"So far she's doing all right. Her temperature has dropped a little, and she's  been asleep ever since we left Dr. Tofu's clinic," Ranma answered at a whisper.  He looked to his father, "Did you bring the medicine Dr. Tofu prepared for  her?"</p><p>"Mmhm," Genma said softly with a nod as he walked over and deposited the said  items in the boy's lap. "I'm proud of you, son."</p><p>"Well what else was I suppose to do when she was looking as bad as she did?"  Ranma pouted, embarrassed at getting caught being so nice to Akane for once.</p><p>"We'll leave you be," Soun whispered with a soft smile as he lead Genma back  out of the room and shut the door. Ranma huffed as a profuse blush briefly  spread across his cheeks. He then set all the medicine stuff up on the desk  before going back to reading his book.</p><p>A couple hours later, Ranma put his book aside. After checking on Akane, who  was still fast asleep, he left the room. He first made a stop at the bathroom,  then he proceeded onward to the kitchen to find that Nabiki was now home as  well and everyone was gathering in the dining room. Knowing if he stayed, he  would be picked on endlessly, Ranma opted instead to pick up two bowls of rice  and two bottles of water with him back to Akane's room, ignoring the staring  questioning people in the room.</p><p>Akane blinked her eyes open and yawned groggily. Slowly sitting up, she looked  around, finding herself in her room. There was a bunch of stuff on her desk and  a strange look book on the floor in front of the desk. Her clock read ten  minutes till five in the afternoon. 'Wow, I've been asleep for a long time,'  she thought to herself. Then she noticed the teddy bear in her arms. 'Where'd  this come from?' she asked herself in confusion. She turned to look at the  weird looking book on the floor, though as she did, she felt so dizzy she  instantly laid back down and closed her eyes, forcing herself to relax and give  her head a chance to catch up with her.</p><p>Akane heard someone enter the room, but the pounding in her head forced her to  keep still. She listened as whoever it was padded across the room. She heard  some things being set down on the floor, then someone knelt beside her. She  felt the back of a hand press to her forehead, then a pair of strong yet gentle  hands grasped her shoulders as a soft masculine voice she immediately  identified as Ranma's spoke quietly to her, "Akane. Wake up for me please.  Akane?"</p><p>Akane was stunned at the amazing degree of kindness and compassion she heard in  that whispering voice. Despite her hot-tempered tomboy spirit, she couldn't  help but obey that soft sweet voice that beckoned to her. It was almost like a  dream. As requested, she opened her eyes and gingerly turned her head to look  at him. His gentle slightly worried gaze met hers.</p><p>"How do you feel?" Ranma asked sincerely.</p><p>"Is there anything in that stuff Dr. Tofu sent that fights killer headaches?"  Akane growled softly.</p><p>"Let me see," Ranma said as he rose and stepped over to the desk to look for  the asked for item. He picked up a piece of paper with instructions on it and  read it over quickly then picked up several bottles, removing the required  amount of pills. Returning to Akane's side, he sat down on the edge of the bed  and deposited the pills. Then he gently helped her to sit up, becoming  surprised that for once, she didn't protest. He picked up one of the water  bottles, opened it, then handed it to Akane who used it to down the pills with  several generous gulps. Ranma took the bottle back from her and sat it on the  floor.</p><p>After a moment, Akane realized she was leaning against Ranma for body support  and blushed before laying back down. "Thanks. You can go eat now if you want.  Everyone should be gathered for dinner about this time," she said, turning her  face to the wall as if to dismiss him.</p><p>"I know. I walked in, picked up a couple of bowls of rice and a couple of  bottles of water, then walked out again. You're more important at the moment,"  he replied matter-of-factly. "We'll wait 15 minutes or so, then we should see  if we can't get some food down you."</p><p>"Go away. I can take care of myself. By the way, where's P-chan. If you've done  anything to him, I'll pound you," Akane replied.</p><p>"Relax. P-chan's with Kasumi. As for going away, I don't think so. I've already  been here all day," Ranma responded.</p><p>"Ranma! You idiotic perv!" Akane growled.</p><p>"Hush! You'll only make yourself worse. Relax," Ranma said reaching over and  putting a hand over her mouth. With his other hand, he picked up the teddy bear  that had been forgotten. "Teddy wants you to get better," he said as he made  the bear hug Akane. She instantly turned and looked at him with an odd look,  then at the bear.</p><p>"That bear's yours, isn't it?" she asked in a low voice.</p><p>"No. It's yours. I gave it to you this afternoon. We don't need you giving that  flu to the pig. So I brought you something else to cuddle and make you feel  better," Ranma answered, tucking the bear back into her arms. Akane blinked and  picked it up to look at it. Oddly, she found it the cutest bear she'd ever seen  with those expressive glass eyes, a sweet face, and fur so incredibly soft you  just had to hug it. Biting back a blush, she hugged the bear.</p><p>"T-thanks. That's… that's... real nice of you. It's cute," Akane admitted,  surprising herself with her own words.</p><p>"Your welcome. I'm glad you like it," Ranma spoke with a soft smile. Akane  shivered and Ranma instinctively reached over and tucked the blankets about  her, then finding her skin to still be rather hot. "Man, that fever just  doesn't want to break."</p><p>"I'll be all right. Really. You can go on and do whatever. Leave me be," Akane  said, hating the feeling of feeling so dependant.</p><p>"Absolutely not," Ranma argued.</p><p>"Ranma, you idiot!" Akane started, ready to give him a severe tongue-lashing,  but her voice was stolen by the wave of nausea that rushed over her. "Oh shit,"  she blurted as she sat up looking green.</p><p>In an instant,  Ranma had a bowl in front of her. She tried her best to hold it back, but her  body one and wretched into the bowl. Ranma frowned in sympathy, and rubbed her  back when she was done. A couple more goes and she looked a tiny bit better,  however extremely weak. As she sat there panting, Ranma pulled forth a napkin  and handed it to her. She involuntarily whimpered as she wiped her mouth clean,  now feeling absolutely horrible. Ranma shifted and gently massaged Akane's back  with his thumbs as she fought to catch her back.</p><p>A bright flash  attracted their attention to the door where Nabiki stood wearing a Cheshire  grin with her camera in hand. Ranma hissed, and Nabiki squeaked before turning  tail to bolt down the hall with Ranma hot on her heels. A minute later, Ranma  reentered the room and kicked the door shut with his foot. He looked to Akane  and produced a wicked grin as he held up the confiscated roll of now ruined  film. For once, Akane grinned back at him.</p><p>Ranma tossed  the roll of film into the wastebasket, then returned to Akane's side, gently  sitting back down on the side of the bed, "Sorry about that. Are you feeling  any better?"</p><p>"A little.  Yeah, my sister can be a real pain in the ass sometimes," the girl replied  softly.</p><p>"I'm sorry you're  sick."</p><p>"I already  told you I'll be all right. Don't worry about it, idiot."</p><p>"I know. I'm  still sorry you're sick."</p><p>"Idiot," Akane  said with a soft sigh, though there was no meaning whatsoever behind the word,  for once.</p><p>"Is your  headache going away? Do you think you might can get some rice into your  stomach? It's got to be pretty empty by now."</p><p>"I… I  suppose," the girl relinquished. Ranma nodded and bent down, picking up one of  the bowls of rice. Realizing it'd gotten cold, he frowned.</p><p>"Damn. It's cold.  I'll be back with a fresh bowl," he said as he got up and carried the bowls  with him back to the kitchen. He caught Kasumi doing the dishes, and she gladly  fixed up two new bowls of rice for him and Akane. With the fresh food in hand,  Ranma thanked her then returned to Akane's room and to her side after once  again shutting the door.</p><p>"Here we go.  Nice and warm," he said as he passed her one of the bowls and a pair of  chopsticks. Akane bit her tongue to hide a blush.</p><p>"Thanks," she  answered softly before slowly taking a few bites of the hot rice. It tasted  good. She just hoped that it would stay in her stomach.</p><p>"You're  welcome," Ranma answered before chowing down on his own bowl of rice. Once  Akane had eaten as much as she could and Ranma had finished his bowl, he sat  the two bowls on the floor. They each took sips from their bottles of water,  then Ranma sat those back on the floor as well. Akane whimpered as the nausea  threatened to return with vengeance. The next thing, she knew, Ranma was  hugging her close to him, again rubbing her back, trying his best to make her  feel even the slightest bit better. Her nausea was forgotten in the surprise of  the situation, then kept at bay by the ear that was pressed to his chest,  causing her to focus her attention on Ranma as she again heard the soft steady  beat of his heart.</p><p>"Ranma," she  protested softly, finding herself blushing before she could hide it at being  held so close to him that the very sound of his pulse made her own heart skip a  beat.</p><p>"Shhh. Relax,"  he whispered. Akane started to argue back, but she found no words came to her  mouth, so she was forced to just sit quietly, allowing the kind idiot to hold  her. She found the soft drumming of his heart in her ear as relaxing as the  last time she'd heard it. Deciding there was no way in hell she could fight  it's serene power of tranquility, she closed her eyes and allowed it to sing  her to sleep.</p><p>Ranma blinked  in confusion at how cooperative Akane was behaving, then made a look of  surprise as he found her falling asleep in his arms once again. 'Am I comfy or  am I boring?' he wondered inwardly. Really, it didn't matter. He still found  her beautiful when she was sleeping and, thus, found himself smiling softly as  he gazed down at her.</p><p>Ranma  let a few blissful minutes pass like that, sitting still as he was, silently  watching the girl tucked gently in his warm embrace as she drifted back to  sleep leaning against his chest. Then, despite wanting to remain like that  forever, he shifted and gently laid her back down in her bed. What he didn't  count on was as he did so, she mumbled in her sleep and subconsciously glomped  his torso, preventing him from leaving her side. Ranma squeaked and instantly  blushed, yet found himself stuck there unless he wished to wake her, which he  didn't. So, thankful for the immunization shot Tofu had given him earlier at  the clinic to prevent Ranma from catching Akane's illness while caring for her,  he laid down in the bed beside her. As he settled, she snuggled up against him  with both the teddy bear <i>and</i> Ranma pinned in her arms while she slept.  Ranma blushed profusely yet couldn't help but grin at the strange twist of  events. After thirty minutes of staring at the ceiling deep in thought, sleep  snuck up upon Ranma and claimed him as well before he even knew it was there.  So, as it was, the two, who were usually bickering like rival house cats, fell  into a deep doze locked comfortably in each other's embrace</p>
