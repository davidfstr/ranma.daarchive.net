</div>The Sister<p>Disclaimer: All characters are owned by their creators. I'm just<br/>borrowing them for a little while but they will be returned in good<br/>condition.<p>Blackness surrounded her. She spun in place slowly, her eyes searching<br/>for any texture in the void before her. Just when a she began to believe<br/>that there was nothing there it began. It was soft at first, barely<br/>above the sound of her own breathing. She twisted, trying to discover<br/>the source of the sound, and its identity. She felt her breath catch in<br/>her throat when she realised what it was, crying. Someone was crying,<br/>someone in great pain.<br/>At first she didn't notice it, there was a slight change in the<br/>darkness, then as the glow became brighter the sobbing became louder.<br/>Just when she thought the glow would blind her it collapsed into a<br/>sobbing girl kneeling before her, her face in her hands. Then the<br/>sobbing girl looked up.<p>Rei bolted upright sweat running off her, eyes wide. She really hated<br/>these kinds of visions they usually left her unable to sleep and cranky<br/>the next day. She already knew that a scout meeting, with the outers,<br/>was going to happen soon. She found her thoughts drifting back to the<br/>last image the vision showed her. A face framed by flaming red hair,<br/>deep blue eyes, and perhaps the most disturbing feature, the symbol of<br/>Pluto flickered on her brow.<p>Meetings at the temple were not uncommon, having the entire solar system<br/>represented was uncommon.<br/>"Okay Rei, you called this meeting so why are we here?" Haraku, the<br/>headstrong Warrior of Uranus demanded. Rei took a deep breath before<br/>meeting the challenge thrown at her.<br/>"Last night I had a vision. A vision I think you all need to know about,<br/>especially Setsuna." This peaked the attention of the entire group,<br/>affairs that involved the lone warrior often led to the involvement of<br/>the entire group.<br/>"What kind of vision Rei?" Setsuna was curious, events of this nature<br/>were not common and thus could be a danger to the creation of the future<br/>she desired.<br/>"There was this girl."<br/>"Was she wearing a Senshi uniform?" Makoto injected.<br/>"No she wasn't, she.." Rei began<br/>"So she was naked?" Haraku butted in.<br/>"Yes she was, but that.."<br/>"Now this sounds like a girl I want to meet!" Haraku grinned at her<br/>partner.<br/>"Would you all let me finish!" Rei's yelling had the desired effect,<br/>everyone was looking at her.<br/>"Perhaps you could summarise the vision?" Ami quietly asked. You could<br/>hear Rei's teeth grinding.<br/>"Fine, girl, crying, red hair, blue eyes, and pluto's symbol. There are<br/>you happy." Rei crossed her arms and humped in her best 'now I'm mad'<br/>manner. Nobody was paying attention to her however, instead everyone's<br/>attention was riveted on the eldest Senshi. It wasn't every day that one<br/>could see all the colour drain from her face, nor was it every day when<br/>you could see her drop her tea cup in shock.<br/>While seeing the only senshi who could look death in the eye and comment<br/>on her mascara lose control, the burning question was why?<br/>"Setsuna-mama is something wrong?" Horatu had never seen her sometimes<br/>parent, when she wasn't spending time with various figures throughout<br/>history, act like this. Not even the time Horatu had discovered the<br/>little blue pills in her dresser drawer.<br/>"Did you notice anything else Rei?" Setsuna was quite proud of the fact<br/>that she asked nicely instead of turning the girls' head to mush.<br/>"Ahh, yea now that you mention it she had this scar on her left<br/>shoulder." Rei was beginning to think that something very bad was about<br/>to happen. She was therefore adequately prepared when Setsuna expression<br/>changed from shocked to something approaching joy, with a healthy dose<br/>of fear.<br/>"By the creator, she's alive!" Setsuna's voice might not have been<br/>pitched high enough for most people to hear, but when you have an entire<br/>room hanging on your every word anybody can hear anything.<br/>"Setsuna who is alive? No riddles just give us the truth." Usagi's<br/>concern shone though her voice.<br/>"She was my sister."<br/>"WHAT!" Ever see a building jump off its foundations due to sound<br/>waves?<p>5 seconds later.<br/>After everyone had recovered for the verbal equivalent of a neutron bomb<br/>the questions flew like machine gun fire.<br/>"You have a sister?"<br/>"What was she like?"<br/>"What happened to her?"<br/>"Any other family members you haven't told us about?"<br/>"Why are we hearing about her now?" The last question had the effect of<br/>shutting up the entire group. Slowly all eyes tracked to the one person<br/>who had asked a good question.<br/>"What?" Usagi tried to laugh at all the stares levelled her way.<br/>"Perhaps I should start off by describing my sister." Setsuna took an<br/>deep breath, preparing herself for the coming ordeal. "She was perhaps<br/>the kindest, most caring person I've ever met. At the same time she<br/>could be the most crass, rudest and most aggressive person you could<br/>ever meet."<br/>"I don't understand." Ami hated contradictions and this person sounded<br/>like one huge contradiction.<br/>"She had this real talent for making enemies I think she was the only<br/>person ever to have princess Serenity hate her."<br/>"I hated her? Why?" Usagi couldn't imagine hating anyone much less<br/>Setsuna's sister.<br/>"There was a small incident when you both were young, I think it had<br/>something to do with food. You forgave her later in life though, I think<br/>that was after she nearly died trying to get you home." Setsuna seemed<br/>lost in the past, reliving old times perhaps happier times for her.<br/>"Why did she nearly die?" Makoto was beginning to like the sound of this<br/>person.<br/>"It's a long story and best left in the past. She did make enemies but<br/>she also made many friends. She was the only one who treated Saturn like<br/>a person after her powers manifested."<br/>Horatu's brow wrinkled in thought as she tried to someone who had been<br/>her friend in a time when she could count her friends on one hand and<br/>have fingers left over.<br/>"You don't mean oneechan?"<br/>"Yes, she did treat you like a sister. She even went so far as to beat<br/>the snot out of some minor noble who treated you badly. That's what she<br/>was like, she would walk into fire for her friends or anyone who needed<br/>her but she could be so sweet at the same time. After I was chosen to<br/>stand guard at the gates of Time I wasn't allowed to have any outside<br/>contact. People feared that the Senshi of time might be influenced if<br/>she had outside contact. She would leave muffins or cookies just outside<br/>the gate for me to find, she was the only one to remember my birthday.<br/>I'll never forget the gift she gave me that first year." A smile had<br/>wormed it way onto Setsuna's face as she remembered the one person who<br/>treated her like a human person in those dark years when she was first<br/>chosen to guard the gates of time.<br/>"What did she give you Setsuna-momma?" Horatu was glad to see a smile on<br/>Setsuna's face she didn't smile enough in Horatu's opinion.<br/>"Two things, a framed photo of the two of us when we were younger, and<br/>two packs of playing cards along with a book on all the known ways to<br/>play solitaire."<br/>"She sounds like a great person Setsuna. There still is the question as<br/>to why we haven't heard about her before." Micharu shifted a bit in<br/>Haraku's embrace. Setsuna's gaze met the floor.<br/>"I didn't know she was alive. She died before the Silver Millenium fell<br/>and would not have been part of Queen Serenity's spell."<br/>"How did she die?" Minako felt that she had to ask the question.<br/>"She drowned. It was early in the war and she was fighting on Earth. She<br/>was part of a small scout force, sent to find the source of the<br/>creatures that had been laying waste to parts of the Earth. They were<br/>ambushed and almost the entire force was ripped to shreds, my sister<br/>ordered a retreat and she was covering the wounded when she was struck<br/>and fell off a cliff into a pool of water and drowned." There was a<br/>moment of silence for one who gave her life for others.<br/>"Setsuna why don't you use the gates to find her?" Usagi had, for the<br/>second time, asked a reasonable question.<br/>"Our powers don't work on each other." Setsuna's features drew into a<br/>small smile. " It was kind of a safe guard to ensure that the two<br/>warriors of Pluto couldn't battle each other." The smile disappeared and<br/>was replaced with a look of sadness. "I couldn't even see her when she<br/>died, I had to learn about it from a survivor of the battle. The gates<br/>will be useless for finding her but I will find her." Setsuna's voice<br/>had been growing in steel with each word, creating a vow at the end that<br/>not even the gods themselves could withstand.<br/>"So how are you going to look for her?" Makoto didn't doubt her word,<br/>she just thought it would be very difficult.<br/>"Thanks to Rei I know she's in Tokyo, she would have to be for Rei to<br/>get such a clear image. I can use the gates, her very presence will<br/>create a ripple in the background mana levels it's simply a question of<br/>looking in the right place with the right eyes."<p>Authors Note: I happened across this idea but now I can't remember who's<br/>it was. I hope that the person can forgive me my bad memory and contact<br/>me.<br/>C&amp;C can be sent to:<br/>big_scary_<br/>This story will only be continued if I get some feedback.<p>The Sister<p>Chapter 1 part 2<p>Disclaimer: I don't own these characters and anyone attempting to sue<br/>will be wasting their time.<p>Authors Notes: Due to the large amount of support I have received I have<br/>decided to continue this story but like all writers I love hearing from<br/>people. People should also note that this chapter deals with things in<br/>Ranma's life. Chapter three will bring together the two universes and<br/>all will be well.<br/>A note on spelling errors, English is my first language but I'm Canadian<br/>so replacement of o's with u's and the changes in spelling of certain<br/>words come from my cultural background. Sorry to ramble, please enjoy<br/>the fic.<p>Timeline Note: Place this sometime before Ranma's mother learns of the<br/>curse.<p>'' Thoughts<br/>[] Panda signs<p>Events were proceeding on par for the denizens of the sub ward of Tokyo<br/>known for its martial arts. Every week or so another student of an<br/>obscure school of martial arts would appear, challenge the local<br/>champion, and go home in disgrace. By all rights this pattern could have<br/>continued for many years but for one thing. The champion was being worn<br/>down. It wasn't any one thing, it was just the constant abuse, death<br/>threats, and beatings.<p>Ranma sat on the roof of the Tendo household involved in his new hobby,<br/>brooding. This was a new hobby for him, he had never thought of it<br/>before his arrival at the Tendo's but somehow it seemed like a good<br/>thing to do. He was even discovering that he was pretty good at it.<br/>Ranma was so deep in thought that he did not notice the change occur,<br/>nor did he really care. Over time he had become more and more<br/>indifferent to what form he was currently in, only noticing when someone<br/>pointed it out to him.<br/>It was the sound of someone placing a ladder against the side of the<br/>house that caused him to abandon his brooding. There were only three<br/>people in the Tendo household who would use a ladder to bother him,<br/>Akane, Nabiki, and Kasumi. Akane and Nabiki would have made their<br/>presence known before placing a ladder so that left Kasumi.<br/>'Kasumi's probably the only person in this whole damn town who gives a<br/>damn about me.' The thought was not new, it had been hanging around in<br/>Ranma's brain for awhile now as the number of people he thought he could<br/>count on dwindled.<br/>"Suppers ready Ranma-chan."<br/>"Thanks Kasumi. I'll be down in a moment."<br/>"Okay Ranma." Kasumi paused before heading down the ladder "You know<br/>Ranma sometimes it helps to talk to someone."<br/>That pretty much summed up Kasumi, most of the time she acted like she<br/>was taking happy pills but every once in a while she showed remarkable<br/>insight.<br/>'Talk to someone, now there's a joke. The only people I could talk to<br/>can't help me. Anyone else would just use it to their advantage.' Ranma<br/>had known for sometime that he was alone. Growing up with just his<br/>father, who would beat him if he didn't devote all his attention to the<br/>Art, had permanently set Ranma apart from the rest of the world. He just<br/>couldn't relate to anyone it seemed, every where he looked he saw people<br/>who had friends, family, and homes. He had none of that, his so-called<br/>friends are either trying to kill or marry him. His father made his life<br/>hell for ten years and the only home he knew was at the Tendo's but even<br/>that was unsure.<p>When you were younger you were told that Trolls live under bridges, as<br/>you grew older you learned the truth, Trolls did not live under bridges<br/>but sometimes you could find Martial Artists under them. If you happened<br/>to look under a certain bridge in a certain park at a certain time you<br/>might happen to find one of the greatest martial artists of all time.<br/>He, or she depending, might be pondering the next battle, searching for<br/>the weakness in the latest opponent, or just trying to escape the<br/>general craziness of life.<br/>Today however the greatest martial artist in the world was not doing any<br/>of this, no today was a day to practice a new skill. Avoidance. Today<br/>Ranma was practising a new battle skill in the war that had become her<br/>life. Ranma had formed the opinion that by removing herself from the<br/>places that she normally visited then the chance of pain would be<br/>lessened.<br/>Some people might call that running from your problems but Ranma figured<br/>that there wasn't much else that could be done. There were a few flaws<br/>with this tactic, Ranma couldn't stay away forever and when she finally<br/>did show up he would often be hurt.<br/>'Looks like it's time for dinner. I'd better be getting back.'<p>"RANMA NO BAKA!" The infamous battle cry of the youngest Tendo sister<br/>rang throughout the streets, followed by a loud thunking sound as a<br/>large wooden object impacted on a human skull. It was just another night<br/>at the Tendo's and Ranma was once again unconscious from blunt force<br/>trauma.<p>Authors End Note: Argh I been bitten by the less is more bug! I can't<br/>think of any way to make this longer! Argh!<br/>I promise the next part will be longer as it will deal with Setsuna's<br/>search for her sister.<p>A side note on the usage of gender nouns. I know that some people will<br/>state that no matter what physical form Ranma is in he's a guy. After<br/>reading Zen's "The Bitter End" and studying a few points that had been<br/>made I surmised that as Ranma becomes more and more depressed he/she<br/>would begin to identify more and more with his female side.<br/>I could launch into a four page defence of my belief but I'll leave it<br/>by saying that this is my story and Ranma will dance and act as I see<br/>fit.<p>Part 3<p>Setsuna was rapidly losing her patience. True, it only had been a week<br/>since she had started looking for her sister and as guardian of time she<br/>was required to have patience. Matters concerning her sister were<br/>different, she was the only family Setsuna had and the only person who<br/>had cared about her as a human being after she became the guardian of<br/>the time gates.<br/>In the beginning she had known this was a huge task, searching for one<br/>person in a city the size of Tokyo was a labour worthy of Grey(1) but<br/>she had not expected to have this much difficulty. Her sister had always<br/>attracted large amounts of chaos and she had been counting on the<br/>general amount of trouble she attracted to stand out. What she had<br/>forgotten to account for was the fact that Tokyo itself generated large<br/>amounts of chaos.<br/>Seeing as how looking for trouble spots would be rather futile Setsuna<br/>had settled on a different approach. Knowing how much her sister could<br/>eat she was visiting restaurants in various wards of Tokyo and<br/>describing her sister. So far she had had no luck, tomorrow she would<br/>try the Nerima ward.<p>The moment Setsuna set foot in Nerima ward she could feel the headache<br/>forming. This wasn't a Tylenol type headache or even a Motrin(2) style<br/>headache, no this was a 'hope someone lops off my head it hurt so much'<br/>style headache. Setsuna knew of only two things that could set off this<br/>style of headache, one was discussing quantum physics with Mandy(3) the<br/>other was losing her connection to the Time gates. Seeing as there were<br/>no blond little girls with dogs named Buttons running around it had to<br/>be the latter.<br/>If seen in a certain light this could be a good thing, it could mean<br/>that her powers were being limited because she was near her sister, or<br/>it could mean that the gates of time had been destroyed in which case<br/>she was out of a job. There was another possibility but Setsuna refused<br/>to consider it, there was just no way that someone could have summoned<br/>the Giant Twinkie(4) without her knowing it.<br/>What ever the source of the headache it was becoming very unpleasant,<br/>and Setsuna quickly needed to sit down, she knew that in a few moments<br/>her headache would clear and she would be fine, but until then it would<br/>be best to sit down somewhere quiet.<br/>Setsuna spotted a nicely adorned park, complete with fountains and<br/>benches and concluded that that would be an ideal place to wait out the<br/>pain.<p>If you asked Ranma what her idea of a good day would be, you would<br/>generally be told that any day in which her feet didn't leave the ground<br/>was a good day. Today was not a good day. Something, probably the<br/>continued existence of Ranma, had ticked off the little psycho<br/>bit..(sorry) Akane and resulted in Ranma taking a scenic tour of Tokyo.<br/>Ranma however was a frequent flyer and could compute the trajectory and<br/>speed of her flight and estimate a fairly reasonable landing area. Ranma<br/>wasn't worried about the landing, she could handle it and even so, for<br/>some reason most of Ranma's flights ended in a watery landing.<br/>Just as she was reaching the apex of the flight, Ranma deduced that she<br/>would land in the park, probably in the fountain. With her luck one of<br/>the others would be there and either try to kill her or date her when<br/>she landed.<br/>'Might as well do the polite thing and warn anyone in the park.'<br/>"LOOOOOOOOK OOOUUUUUUTTTTT!"<p>Somewhere beyond the eyes of mortals a deity known as Fate rubbed her<br/>hands in<br/>gleeful anticipation. Beside her sat her sister Destiny, doing her best<br/>Kodachi<br/>impersonation.<p>Footnotes:<br/>(1) Grey is Grey-Le-Shard from metroanime's series of fics which I<br/>sugest everone read.<br/>(2) Motrin style headache is a blantent rip off of a series of headaches<br/>Motrin does.<br/>(3)Mandy is from the animanics show. Cute little kid who only knows the<br/>words 'why' and 'Okay I live you by bye'<br/>(4)The Gian Twinkie refence comes from the belief a friend of my mine<br/>has that twinkies are the highest form of life on earth and one day the<br/>Giant Twinkie shall revel it self to punish the fools who have consumed<br/>it's breathren
