</div>Ranma 1/2: The Sister<p>Disclaimer: I do not own any of these characters, they are owned by<br/>rich and powerful corporations who could squish me like a bug should<br/>they so choose.<p>Chapter 6: It's snowing in hell.<p>Nerima Park: Under a Bridge.<p>Ranma was crying, and she couldn't stop. All the stress of the<br/>last few months, coupled with the events earlier this morning had<br/>destroyed all the mental barriers she had erected over the years. And so<br/>she cried. She cried for everything that had happened, but also for<br/>everything that she knew had happened but she couldn't stop.<br/>"What have I become? I can't stand it anymore. Maybe if I leave<br/>things will get better."<br/>"That's a cowards way out."<br/>Ranma raiser her head to stare at the young girl leaning against<br/>one of the bridge supports.<br/>"Who are you?"<br/>"Does it matter? You look like you could use a friendly ear."<br/>Ranma took a moment to consider her offer and examine this<br/>'friendly' stranger. The long white hair reminder her of Koh-Lon but<br/>the sheer amount of peace radiating off her was more like Kasumi after<br/>bringing on chocolate. The long dress was a bit odd but after the last<br/>year Ranma couldn't care less what another person dressed like.<br/>"Take a seat, this could take a while."<p>Tendo Household:<p>It was only with the greatest feat of will that Setsuna stopped<br/>herself from firing off a 'dead scream' at the groggy Akane. Nodaka was<br/>appalled at Akane's behavior, after all she always seemed like such a<br/>nice girl, and here she was insulting a total stranger she hadn't even<br/>met.<br/>"Akane! Apologize to her."<p>Akane blinked at Nodaka when Setsuan noticed that her eyes<br/>weren't quite tracking, and they seemed a little unfocused.<br/>"It's alright Miss Satomne, people with concussions often don't<br/>mean what they say." Akane glared at Setsuna.<br/>"Are you saying there's something wrong with me?" Akane began<br/>glowing. "I'm the best martial artist in all of Nerima, there's NOTHING<br/>wrong with me."<p>Inside Setsuna's head there was a little mental entry added to<br/>Akane's name, delusional. Along with arrogant, sadistic, spoiled and<br/>possible psychotic. Setsuna was well on her way to disliking the person<br/>who had inflicted so much pain on her sister.<p>Under the Bridge:<p>"And that's pretty much what happened."<br/>"That's quite a lot to happen to one so young, most Gods have<br/>not experienced that which you have." The Mysterious Lady<br/>smiled kindly at Ranma, amazed at what the young person before her had<br/>endured.<br/>"I just wish I knew why all this stuff happened to me!"<br/>"Wish approved." Was the last thing Ranma heard as blackness<br/>reached out to embrace her.<p>1200 ASM (After the founding of the Silver Millenium)<p>Ranko was pissed, really and truly pissed. She had been tacking<br/>a string of murders for nearly two weeks without any results and<br/>it was starting to get on her nerves. She knew she should have<br/>left the matter in the hands of the local guard units but something<br/>about the murders just wouldn't let her rest.<br/>Currently Ranko was in a bar, it was a rather nice bar but it<br/>was still a bar. Along one side was a rather large counter and behind<br/>it was Jill. Jill was the bartender and owner of the place entitled<br/>appropriately enough "Jill's Place" Jill was also a old friend of<br/>Ranko,<br/>but more than that, she was a fellow red head, a hair color that was<br/>truly rare in the queendom.<br/>"Hey Jill have you heard anything unusual lately?"<br/>Jill looked at her friend, the last two weeks had been hard on<br/>the small red head and Jill hoped that she might have good news for her<br/>friend. "No I haven't heard anything about the murders Ranko."<br/>Ranko seemed to slump in her seat, several times in the last two<br/>weeks she had asked the same question and had been given the same<br/>answer.<br/>"Why don't you leave it to the guards Ranko. I highly doubt that<br/>its a matter the concerns the Great Sailor Senshi."<p>Three Days Later.<p>"I really wish Jill had been right." Ranko muttered as she<br/>tested her bonds for what seemed like the twentieth time. It had turned<br/>out that the murders were part of a ritual to bind a entity of chaos<br/>to the temporal plane preventing it from continuing to influence the<br/>universe as it should.<br/>The murders had been the result of failed bindings. The cult<br/>behind it had decided that a Senshi would make the perfect host.<br/>Ranko had been drugged and kidnapped once sleeping draught had taken<br/>effect. Now she was tied to an makeshift alter, unable to escape.<br/>"Now what?" Ranko regretted her statement as soon as she had<br/>made it, saying such things was like spitting in the face of the<br/>universe.<br/>"Now we bind chaos inside your mortal form so it can no longer<br/>cause havoc in the universe." Ranko glanced to her left, slightly<br/>startled that someone had managed to sneak up on her. Standing not<br/>three feet away from her was the high priest of the cult, going purely<br/>by the amount of decoration on his robe.<br/>"The other will come for me."<br/>"Their efforts will be in vain, in a few minutes all will be<br/>complete and chaos will be forever bound to this plane."<br/>"You will not succeed." Ranko snarled.<br/>"We shall see."<br/>With that the high priest turned to regard about five other<br/>priests who had entered while the two of them had been talking.<br/>"Brothers, we shall begin the ceremony."<p>It lasted for what seemed like hours. The ceremony mostly<br/>consisted of the required chanting and spell shaping. Towards the end a<br/>cloud of shifting colors began to form and swirl around the alter.<br/>Ranko could feel space beginning to warp around her, just as her sister<br/>could feel and manipulate time she could feel and manipulate space. The<br/>priests began to chant louder, the high priest began to counter chant,<br/>forming an oddly musical harmony with the others. The cloud' swirling<br/>became faster and faster, Ranko could literally see space folding in on<br/>itself, it was beginning to make her physically ill.<br/>The chanting began to reach a furious rate, the Head Priest<br/>began gesturing in wild arch and the cloud began to settle on Ranko.<br/>At first it was hardly noticeable, only a slight tingle running the<br/>length<br/>of her skin. Soon it became agony, Ranko could feel her skin freezing<br/>and boiling without pattern or reason. In some places she thought it<br/>felt like being caressed by a lover in other she felt long claws pierce<br/>her flesh. Throughout it all she refused to scream, she would survive<br/>this and avenge the girls who had been murdered.<br/>Just as the chanting reacher a fever pitch there was a loud boom<br/>and the Head Priest looked down to see a rather large hole in his chest.<br/>He looked up in time to see Jill, having entered while everyone s'<br/>attention was elsewhere pump another shell into the chamber of her<br/>shotgun.<br/>"Suck my boom stick!"<br/>The ceremony quickly ended as priests ran for their (meager)<br/>lives.<p>An Hour Later.<p>After having dealt with the priests and the city guard both red<br/>heads were relaxing back at the bar.<br/>"So Jill, where did you get the shotgun?" Ranko was nursing a<br/>rather large glass of very old scotch. Normally she didn't drink but<br/>right now she felt like it.<br/>"Well Ranko I wasn't always a bartender you know. So what did<br/>those guys do to you anyway."<br/>Ranko was silent for a while as she thought back to the events<br/>of only a few hours ago.<br/>"I'm not really sure Jill, I'm going to have to go talk to the<br/>Queen and try to find out."<br/>"Perhaps you should stop by Mercury first, you wouldn't want to<br/>trouble the Queen with something that could be nothing."<p>Mercury: Two weeks later.<p>To say that Ranko was pissed would be putting it mildly. The<br/>normal time for a trip to Mercury was about one week. Her trip had been<br/>extended by two weeks cause of several unconnected freak accidents. As<br/>a result the ship she had been traveling on had run out of regular food<br/>and everyone had to fall back to emergency rations. Reconstatuited Gagh<br/>was one of the least edible foods in existence and of course that was<br/>the only thing the ship had. To make matters worse the water<br/>recrimination system had broken down on the seventh day, meaning there<br/>were no showers.<br/>Now hungry tired and dirty Ranko was being harassed by a customs agent<br/>who thought the sun shone out of his arse.<br/>"Look, I don't care if some new regulations were passed, get the<br/>hell out of my way."<br/>"Listen miss I don't care for you attitude one bit, now if<br/>you'll please step into the next room we can begin the cavity search."<br/>For Ranko this was the last straw, the merest flicker of<br/>thought wrapped her in her 'working' clothes and she leveled a fist<br/>crackling with energy at the customs officer.<br/>"Would you care to repeat that?"<br/>The customs officer, having never dealt with any of the Senshi<br/>before regarded the outlandish outfit Ranko now wore and wondered how<br/>much she cost for the night. Regreatably he uttered this out loud.<br/>The resulting explosion took out three quarters of the building.<p>An hour later.<p>After having dug herself out of the ruins of the customs house,<br/>Ranko had marched straight into the Mercurian palace. The palace<br/>guard, having more experience with the Senshi decided that it would not<br/>due to interfere with the obviously angry warrior of Pluto.<br/>This helped facilitate matters when Ranko asked for directions<br/>to the palaces library, the one place you could almost be guaranteed to<br/>find the Mercurian princess. True to form Ami, crown princess of<br/>mercury was indeed in the library. The problem was that the library was<br/>rather large and had turned into something of a maze over the centuries.<br/>Ranko was a little too angry to search the whole place for so<br/>she decided to take a short cut. Leaping on top of the book cases she<br/>took a deep breath before bellowing.<br/>"Ami! Where are you!"<br/>"Ranko?" Ami voice answered from one of the farther portions<br/>of the library.<br/>"Should have known she was in that section."<p>Three long leaps later Ranko touched down in a small cul-de-sac<br/>in what had been deemed the 'Venus' section. Ami was sitting at a<br/>rather comfortable reading desk and seemed a bit flushed.<br/>"Wha, what are you doing here Ranko?"<br/>"Sorry if I'm interrupting your studies but I needed to consult<br/>with you." Ranko's knowing grin revealed that she knew just what kind<br/>of 'studies' the mercurian princess was involved in.<br/>"Please sit and tell me what is so important that you had to<br/>seek me out in person."<br/>Complying with Ami's requests Ranko spent the next hour<br/>recounting the events of the past month. When she was finished Ami<br/>possessed a small glint in her eye.<br/>"So you came here to find out if anything was wrong?"<br/>"Yes."<br/>"So why come to me? There are plenty of doctors and scientists<br/>on Mercury."<br/>"Your the best scientist on Mercury and the only one I trust."<br/>"Well then, shall we go? The sooner we begin the sooner we can<br/>resolve this."<p>The tests took several hours to complete, and Ranko's temper and<br/>foul mood had begun to reappear as the hours wore on. Finally after<br/>every conceivable test had been preformed Ami appeared with the results.<br/>"From what I can tell your fine physically, mentally,<br/>emotionally, but..."<br/>"But?" Ranko could tell that she wasn't going to like what was<br/>coming next.<br/>"It's rather hard to describe, our bests guesses is that your<br/>beginning to warp probability."<br/>Ranko did a double blink.<br/>"Can you repeat that in english?"<br/>"The odds of an event occurring in your presence are beginning<br/>to<br/>be bent. For example the odds of all those little problems happening on<br/>board that ship at the same time are so huge that it would be useless to<br/>try and calculate them."<br/>"So what your saying is that more and more weird things are<br/>going to happen around me?"<br/>"It's worse. It seems that the higher the odds of something<br/>happening, the more likely it will happen in your presence."<br/>"Is there anyway to stop it?"<br/>"No, like it or not Ranko your cursed."<p>Modern Day: ten minutes later.<p>Ranko stared up at the bridge supports, she now knew why all<br/>these things seemed to happen.<br/>"A curse, why did it have to be a curse?"<p>To Be Continued<p>Authors notes: Sorry for taking so long to finish this one, writers<br/>block and depression make for slow writing.<br/>Three points go to anyone who get the Gagh reference.
