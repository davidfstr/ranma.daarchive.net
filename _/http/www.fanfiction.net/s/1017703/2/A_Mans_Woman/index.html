</div>To the casual observer, it might have appeared that Soun Tendo and his wife, Kimiko, were sharing a calm moment together upon their own back porch. It could not be denied that it was a truly beautiful afternoon in the early fall. The weather was the sort of crisp coldness that, when coupled with a brilliant autumn sun, lent itself perfectly to the enjoyment of watching the leaves change into their mature hues. The illusion of harmony was almost crystallized into perfection as a single crimson oak leaf drifted lazily back and forth upon the air currents before alighting gently on the glassy surface of the Koi pond. If the patriarch of the Tendo Clan, Soun, had not been desperately searching for a means to convince his wife of the soundness of a promise he had made over 20 years ago, he might have been moved to a Haiku. As it was, the thought of a perfect 17 syllables never even entered his mind.<p>*********<p>Bill presents:<p>Ranma ½, A Man's Woman<p>Part Two: Deceiving Appearances<p>*********<p>Kimiko, seated next to her husband, took a small sip of her tea before placing the cup down between them. "Why did you not tell me?" She asked softly, still staring out at the pond.<p>"I did not think you would understand."<p>"You were right."<p>For several more minutes, the two sat in silence. Then, Soun cleared his throat and began to speak. "20 years ago, before we were married, I made a pledge of honor to my training partner, and best friend, Genma that our children would be wed. He and I saw hell together under the old master. We thought it only right that after such hardships, our schools should be joined."<p>"The issue here, husband," Kimiko countered in her most formal tone, "is not the validity of your pledge to Genma, for I feel that is rather moot now. Rather, I would speak of the question of your honesty to your wife."<p>Stunned, Sound could did not answer immediately. As always, he felt it better to think first and then to answer questions. In all serious relationships, he mused silently, the only true problems were ones of trust. Repairing this breech without betraying his honor would require the utmost humility and tact. Suddenly, the irrational urge to escape his problems by fainting dead away rose within Soun's mind. Irritably, he quelled such an unworthy thought.<p>"I am sorry, Kimiko. I acted selfishly and foolishly in my desire to see the continuation of the school and the honor of our clan. On my life, it will not happen again."<p>Then it was Kimiko's turn to sit in silent thought. The weight of Soun's words could not be denied, but neither could the sincerity of his regret. Truly, he had become a formidable man in the years she had known him. "Oh Soun." Kimiko said as she removed the tea from between them, "How is it that you are able to make a heartfelt apology seem like an ironclad defense?"<p>Soun reached over and slid his hand over his wife's tiny fingers, pausing briefly at the golden twin of the ring he wore. "Maintaining pride in defeat is something I learned after I married you."<p>The matriarch of the Tendo family sighed deeply and leaned her head slightly so that it rested on the solid muscle of her husband's shoulder. "What, then, are we going to do about Ranma?"<p>"Well, pledge or no pledge, I don't think a marriage will work."<p>"Perhaps we should consider adopting Ranma in order to unite the schools?" Kimiko speculated. "But, husband, the question of what to do with Ranma right now is far more pressing. Even if she were not the daughter of your best friend, I would still offer the girl a place to stay. She has obviously seen hard times."<p>"I agree, but what about Genma? Why would he send his daughter here with her pet panda? Clearly something must have gone wrong."<p>"Hmmmm." Kimiko said as she pondered the question of the absent Saotome. "Speaking of the panda, I wonder where he had gotten to?"<p>At very that moment, an extremely human hand slid open the screen behind the two Tendos. Turning, they saw before them the prodigal father himself, Genma Saotome. Soun recognized his old friend immediately. There were differences, to be sure. Ten years on the road could not help but change a man. He was heavier than he had been in his youth, but with the sort of bulk that could be dangerous to an opponent in a fight. Yet for all the wear and tear he (and his hair) had seen, Genma stood very much as Soun remembered him.<p>In a heartbeat, the Soun was on his feet, clasping Genma's callused hand. "Old friend! How have you been? How was China? Kimiko, would you be so kind as to pour our guest some tea. Please, sit down."<p>Genma accepted the steaming cup Kimkio offered him, rumbled his thanks for the tea and took a seat, staring straight ahead at the same floating crimson leaf that the husband and wife pair had observed earlier. The grim expression on Genma's face was not lost on Soun. He had been with Genma through thick and thin and there was no mistaking the air about his friend. Genma clearly had much to say and needed time to place his story into an organized whole. With true Japanese hospitality, Soun swallowed his myriad of questions and took up a similarly meditative pose next to Genma. In contrast to her husband, Kimiko was put off by the sudden appearance of the man whose daughter had caused so much turmoil that day. Genma had simply taken a seat with no hint that he would even provide an explanation. Yet, like her husband, Kimiko was too polite to press for details. So, following the abrupt arrival of the missing father, a wholly different sort of silence ensued for the trio.<p>*********<p>Nabiki blew out a pent up breath, and quickly inhaled again. It was too soon after that workout to be depriving herself of oxygen, she thought. The middle Tendo sister sat propped up against the hard wood of the dojo wall. It was not comfortable but, with the way her body ached, no position would be. Glancing over to the corner of the dojo she saw that Ranma and Akane were still deep in conversation, their hands wildly gesticulating about some technique or another. The moment the two had awoken from the spectacular double knockout, they had begun to dissect the battle they had just fought. In the intervening hours, the pair had paused from conversation to train a bit with the other Tendo sisters, but both Akane and Ranma seemed eager to get back to their discussion. For her part, Akane seemed to be ecstatic about having a peer to train and talk with. In the same way, the once-quite Ranma had become much more animated when talking about something she was so obviously skilled at. Nabiki herself and Kasumi had participated in the debate for a while, but there was only so long they could talk about someone else's fight before they felt the need to spar. Reminded of the series of bouts she and Kasumi had fought, Nabiki swiveled her head to gaze at her other sister.<p>Kasumi was seated against the wall, drenched in sweat, in what could kindly be described as a heap. For a brief moment Nabiki allowed herself a smile of pride. Kasumi was still panting in exhaustion from the sparing they had done, while she herself was well on the road to recovery. Still, though, Kasumi had probably slackened her training while in college; classes, friends, and a boyfriend were a lot to handle while trying to maintain a religious practice schedule. Again Nabiki turned her head to look at her younger sister. On the other end of the spectrum from Kasumi's hectic college life was Akane's zealous denial of the things Nabiki herself enjoyed most: sleeping in, hanging out with friends after school, boys. At the last one, Nabiki sighed deeply, her hypoxia temporarily forgotten. There was at least one advantage Akane's near monastic life-style offered: as today's training had proven, the youngest Tendo's practice schedule had obviously put her on a higher level, martially speaking, than the other two sisters. She might have even been better than their father. Despite herself, Nabiki quietly wished she possessed Akane's flawless technique, if only to deal with an annoyingly sexist pig.<p>Drawing another large breath, Nabiki heaved herself off of the floor. "Come on guys, we need to get ready for dinner."<p>Kasumi let out a small whimper and began the arduous process of standing up. Akane and Ranma, on the other hand, were on their feet nearly instantly, having recovered from their sparing much sooner than either of the other two sisters had thought was fair.<p>As the walked towards the house, Ranma still appeared to have something more to say about the match. Leaning over, she grinned at Akane. "I've gotta tell ya, you're not going to catch me like that again."<p>Akane smiled at her new friend's small boast, "Maybe I'll catch you another way?"<p>"Well, I'm just gonna train harder, so I don't get caught at all."<p>"I'll see your training and raise you another match tomorrow morning. Say 6am?"<p>"Deal, Akane." Ranma said, smiling slightly himself.<p>*********<p>Once inside the house, Kasumi paused momentarily and leaned against a wall. "The bathroom's just down that way, Ranma." She said, pointing with her other hand. "Why don't you have a shower before dinner?"<p>"Um, do I have to?" The sweaty red-head asked. It was not lost on any of the sisters that Ranma's stance became suddenly defensive. All of them had enough tact, though, to refrain from pointing out the shift.<p>"Yes, please." Kasumi said. "You need to wash off all that road dust, too."<p>"Ok." Ranma said as she obediently trudged off in the direction Kasumi had indicated.<p>*********<p>After the newcomer had departed, the trio of sisters continued on the way to their rooms to gather up bathing supplies. Walking down the hall, the three could not have looked more different. Akane was so full of energy that her long hair bounced from side to side as she nearly skipped along. Next to her, Nabiki walked with the certain, easy gait she always possessed. Kasumi, normally tall and statuesque, had been reduced to a hunched, limping mess.<p>"Its too bad Daddy couldn't train with us." Akane said, turning excitedly to her sisters.<p>"Yeah, that workout just wasn't hard enough." Nabiki intoned sarcastically.<p>Akane stuck out her tongue, "You can't fool me. I know you and Kasumi like training with Daddy as much as I do."<p>"Well, yes." Kasumi admitted. "But you have to admit that he goes overboard sometimes."<p>"Overboard? Try down right crazy." Nabiki snorted. To describe their father's teaching style as zealous was a grand act of understatement.<p>"Well, I guess you both aren't going to want to train with me, Daddy and Ranma tomorrow morning."<p>"Oh my." Kasumi said, stretching a kink out of her back. "I have to get back to campus and study. You know how that is."<p>Nabiki's lips quirked upwards at Kasumi's none-too-subtle fabrication. But, she reminded herself, her own priorities and Kasumi's definitely lay in a similar direction. "And I have a lot of sleeping to do, little sis."<p>Akane put her hands on her hips and stuck out her tongue again in a display of extreme annoyance at her sisters' reluctance to train with her. Akane felt that if Nabiki was going to duck out of training like she had done earlier that week, a payback was definitely in order. "How are you ever going to beat Kuno for real, Nabiki, if you don't train?" Akane asked innocently. If there was one way to nettle her sister, it was to bring up her air-head classmate.<p>"I can beat that moron any time!" Nabiki said angrily.<p>"Those aren't the odds Hiroshi and Daisuke are giving." Akane shot back.<p>"Cha! Those idiots have starting betting on other people's fights? How mercenary can you get?" Nabiki said, shaking her head in disgust. It was like some people had no honor at all. Suddenly, Nabiki turned her head away from her younger sister and looked past the open screen into the room where her mother and father were sitting. "Hey, who's that guy with Mom and Dad?" She said, abruptly shifting the topic of the conversation.<p>Both Kasumi and Akane's shrugged. The large man in the white gi they had glimpsed as they had walked by could have been anyone. Their parents both ran successful businesses, so it wasn't unusual for guests to come and go unannounced.<p>Quickly forgetting the stranger and her teasing of Nabiki, Akane looked across at her older sister with concern. "Kasumi, you really should get Mom to take a look at you before you go back to school. That bruise looks really bad."<p>Kasumi smiled. "I know. I just need to soak for about hour first."<p>*********<p>Nearly submerged in the steaming waters of the tub, Ranma sat in quite contemplation. It had become overwhelmingly apparent that the Tendo's were good people; the parents had accepted him almost immediately, despite the circumstances of his arrival and his erroneous gender. The two older sisters had been kind enough, to say nothing of Akane's almost instantaneous friendship. Still, even good accepting people couldn't tolerate a sex-changing freak under their roof, he thought bitterly. It might be best to simply slip away in the night. Go back to China and forget all this crap about the Tendo's. Forget the first people he had befriended in years. Forget how his heart skipped a beat when Akane smiled. Yeah, wouldn't that be best?<p>"No!" He forced himself to think: running was a coward's way out. It was a Panda's way out. Ranma Saotome had had enough of running to fill two lifetimes. It was a man's way to turn and face things head on. Even if the Tendos rejected him, it would not be his failure. "I guess I'd better go out." He thought with newfound confidence.<p>Ranma stood up.<p>*********<p>Kasumi, clutching her towel in her right hand, slid open the screen and stepped into the steamy bathroom with Akane and Nabiki right behind her.<p>"I just wish Daddy would let me take a look at those scrolls." Akane trailed off, noticing that her older sister had stopped dead. "What the matter?" She asked, stepping around Kasumi. As the steam blew away, a very naked young man, apparently frozen in the process of stepping out of the tub, confronted the sisters. For a moment neither the girls nor the boy said or did anything. Then, abruptly, all three sisters stepped back into the changing room and Kasumi slid the screen closed.<p>*********<p>"Ayieeeeee!"<p>Kasumi was the first to come to her senses and immediately stopped screaming. Turning, she grabbed Akane and Nabiki by the shoulders.<p>"Stop it!" Kasumi commanded, her voice betraying more than a little of the fear they all were feeling. "Nabiki, you go get Dad and Mom! Akane, we need to get some weapons or something."<p>"Why don't we just kill him with our bare hands?" Akane asked as Nabiki dashed off, barely remembering to wrap a towel around herself as she went.<p>"Because I'm too scared, that's why!" Kasumi screamed over her shoulder as she tore out of the changing room.<p>*********<p>Just as Akane and Kasumi rounded the hallway, headed back from the dojo towards the bathroom, they saw that Nabiki had reached the door to the porch to warn her mother and father about the pervert in the bathroom. Both sisters had immediately gone to Akane's bedroom. Leaping out of the window had proven the shortest route to the dojo for weapons. Suitably, both girls were armed to the teeth, but they noticed with some embarrassment that only Nabiki had maintained the presence of mind to put on any clothes. Still, towels or no, whoever was in the bathroom was now in for the beating of a lifetime. With that thought in mind, they watched as Nabiki slid open the screen in front of her. All three sisters saw that her mother and father were still sitting with their guest.<p>"There's some strange guy in the bathroom." Nabiki said breathlessly.<p>Suddenly, all the members of the Tendo Clan turned towards the distinct sound of a throat being cleared. Before them stood a slope shouldered boy with black hair, dressed in the same clothes the red-headed girl had worn earlier.<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome. Sorry 'bout this."<p>*********<p>Author's Notes: Wow, thanks for all the great C&amp;C on the last chapter! Keep 'em coming! There were a lot of thoughts regarding Akane's martial potential. I hope this chapter and subsequent ones will go a ways towards explaining Soun's disposition and how that will contribute to Akane's progression. Plus, let me just say that I have a few other tricks up my fictional sleeves, so hold on tight. This chapter ended up being a little choppy, given the nature of the comic, but what can you do? I am also hoping that the next few chapters will be a little smoother and I will get to explore the developing relationship dynamic between R&amp;A. And there are going to be some more excellent fight scenes (Akane vs. male Ranma)!<p>As always, remember to take it easy!
