</div><p>Few things were as important to Ranma Saotome as winning. It was his passion, his goal and his muse. Most people hate to lose, but what set Ranma apart from the common rabble was his drive towards triumph: his Nike, in the classical Grecian sense. This is not to say that Ranma didn't appreciate the finer things in life: the simple pleasure of an afternoon nap as the history teacher droned on; the brief, albeit savory delight of a stolen morsel of food; the guilty, yet irresistible enchantment of the opposite sex for a boy of Ranma's age. Yes, these things, and many others, occupied untold hours of Ranma Saotome's day. Yet time and time again Ranma found himself drawn back to the dojo, back to the siren's song of the win. When the mood took him, which was quite often, Ranma could train until his muscles burned and his bones ached, all in pursuit of that fleeting, ephemeral goal: victory!</p><p>Bill presents:</p><p>Ranma ½, A Man's Woman</p><p>Part Eleven: If you like Piña Colada</p><p>"I give up. Let me go!" Ranma laughed, on his belly, pounding the ground in mock pain.</p><p>The boy sitting on top of Ranma, though, was relentless as he tightened his grip on Ranma's leg, "Only if you give me your dojo's sign!"</p><p>"Never!" Ranma cried. And just as it seemed that Ranma would be defeated once and for all, he managed to break the boy's grasp. With lightning speed, and surprising gentleness, Ranma slipped out from the hold and caught his opponent in a bear hug. "Ha ha! Now the tables are turned!"</p><p>The boy wiggled and kicked furiously, but finding no purchase, eventually conceded, "Aw, no fair Sensei."</p><p>"When does fair have anything to do with fighting?" Ranma asked, setting the boy down and ruffling his hair. Ranma stood and clapped his hands. "Alright class, everyone line up!"</p><p>The dozen or so young students in the dojo reluctantly stopped their own wrestling and stood up. Off in the corner, Ranma sighted a pair of particularly zealous combatants who had not heeded their Sensei's call. He had to step over to the diehards and, as they continued to wrestle, separate them bodily. As Ranma directed the two miscreants back to the center of the dojo, the rest of the children assembled themselves into a rough row. The students looked on expectantly as Ranma paced up and down the line.</p><p>"Everyone did a great job today! I am very proud of you for working so hard. Now remember, when you go back to your homes, be polite and respectful. It's only in the dojo where anything goes. Class dismissed."</p><p>As the children applauded the end of class, Akane and Nabiki clapped along. The two sisters both started to push themselves up from where they had been sitting against the wall, but as they did, Ranma waved them away. He stepped over to the students he had separated before and took them both aside. The rest of the children, sensing a lecture about to be delivered, broke and ran for the locker room.</p><p>"Uh oh," Nabiki whispered to Akane, giggling, "Somebody's in trouble with Sensei."</p><p>"Be nice, Nabiki." Akane replied, swatting her sister, "Ranma will handle those two just fine. He's actually a pretty good teacher."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yeah, he's really been doing a great job."</p><p>"That sounds a lot better than the advanced class. No more stabbings, right?"</p><p>"Well, there's no love loss there, but I think everyone will come around in a bit. Ayaka might take a little longer."</p><p>Akane turned from Nabiki to face Ranma as he walked over. The two students he had just admonished were running to join their friends in the locker room. Akane noticed that neither one looked very contrite. But still, she had to give credit where credit was due: Ranma was fitting himself into the teaching schedule and it made the work load easier for everyone with both parents gone.</p><p>"Hey Sensei." Nabiki laughed, punching Ranma in the arm playfully.</p><p>"Hey guys. I guess that's about it for today, huh?" Ranma said.</p><p>"Well, there is the little matter of a sparring match," said Akane, smiling and cracking her knuckles.</p><p>"Aw, no way. Your mom is going to kill me if she comes back from vacation and my ribs are still broken. I have got to heal up."</p><p>"Well, we've got to get in some practice. Nabiki is getting really slow," Akane said, throwing her arm around her sister's waist and grinning.</p><p>Nabiki playfully shoved Akane away, "Slow? I am going to beat that smile off of your face in about a second."</p><p>"Ok, sis. I'll give you a handicap." Akane slipped her right hand behind her back and tucked it through her belt. "Southpaw only."</p><p>"You're gonna regret that." said Nabiki without any real malice in her voice.</p><p>"I'll sit this one out," Ranma offered, but there was no one to listen. The two sisters were already in the middle of the dojo warming up.</p><p>Ranma stayed to escort the students around Akane and Nabiki as they sparred. As Ranma watched the two Tendo sisters move back and forth across the dojo, something occurred to him. After the last student had been delivered to her waiting mother, Ranma ran inside the house and up to his room. Once back in the dojo, Ranma slipped on the red jade sunglasses and watched as the fight continued. With the distraction of sight removed, Akane and Nabiki lit up like Christmas trees. Almost literally, Ranma thought as he watched the two collections of lights wheel across the dojo. It was easy at this point for Ranma to see the flow of chi within a person's body, but was searching for something more subtle. He tried to block out the meridians of the two girls, but it was very difficult; Akane's blue and gold aura flashed brilliantly across the floor, only to be met by Nabiki's more subdued, and more balanced, colors. However, as Ranma watched intently, something more understated began to reveal itself: between the two girls stretched a mesh of constantly shifting threads. From one heartbeat to the next ephemeral filaments rearranged themselves, almost too quickly to be noticed. Ranma watched, mesmerized by the strings that bent between the girls. As he did, something else became clear: Akane, for all her self-possessed technique, seemed to be ignoring the flow of chi between herself and Nabiki, almost fighting it.</p><p>Ranma's observation came to a screeching halt as Nabiki sidestepped one of Akane's attacks and lashed out with her foot. Akane took a hard hit on her undefended right and slid across the dojo floor, right into Ranma's lap.</p><p>"Akane, you should at least buy him dinner first," Nabiki giggled.</p><p>In a flash, Akane was off of Ranma's lap and kneeling across the doorway from him. Both blushed furiously and tried to deny any wrongdoing. Nabiki, filled with delicious self-confidence from her victory, walked between the stammering teens and out of the dojo door. Just before she was out of sight, Nabiki called back over her shoulder, "I told you that you'd regret it."</p><p>Inside the house, Ranma sat down at the living room table for dinner. Even through the Tendo family was gone, Nabiki most recently to her cram class, Ranma took his usual position facing out into the yard. He looked up as Akane pushed aside the curtains and entered the room from the kitchen. She was holding a steaming ceramic bowl with a pair of blue ducky pot holders. After setting down the food in the center of the table, Akane took her typical place shoulder to shoulder with Ranma. She served Ranma a heaping dollop and then gave herself an equal portion. After removing the potholders from her hands, Akane indicated that they should begin.</p><p>"What did you call this?" Ranma asked, picking at his food with chopsticks.</p><p>"Kraft Cheese and Macaroni." Akane said, levering a bite up to her mouth. The cheesy packets had left an orange residue on Akane's fingers during the cooking and soon her mouth was colored an identical shade.</p><p>Ranma was still unconvinced. "What are the green things? And the pink things?"</p><p>Akane scowled and set down her chopsticks, "Peas and cut up hotdogs. It's one of my mother's American specialties. Eat."</p><p>Ranma speared an inoffensive looking hotdog bit and scooped up a morsel of the small, slimy and ever so orange noodles. With a trembling hand, he placed the bite on his tongue, bit down, chewed for a moment then swallowed. Ranma carefully wiped his mouth with the napkin and considered his words. "It's, ah…not bad."</p><p>"Really?" Akane said happily, "Oh, if you like this, there are so many dishes I could do. I'll have to make you my famous stir fry. It's got capers and peanut butter and gorgonzola cheese. Mom won't let me cook it in the house, but I'm sure that you'll love it."</p><p>"Mmmkay," Ranma mumbled through another bite, but inwardly he winced.</p><p>The two teenagers sat in comfortable silence for a while, chewing and enjoying the view through the open screen out into the back yard. It was a cool fall evening, not cold enough to be considered crisp, but still nice. The trees, deprived of the summer's warmth, had begun the change to their fall colors in earnest. Even though clouds covered the moon, the light from the street lamps outside peeked over the back yard wall and illuminated the koi pond. As Ranma finished up his food, he could see rain drops starting to fall on the pond, sending little ripples chasing out across the surface of the water.</p><p>"Akane?" Ranma began, "Can I ask you a question?"</p><p>Akane took a sip from her water, "Sure."</p><p>"Why did you let Nabiki win today?"</p><p>"What? Ranma I would never…" but even as Akane began a vehement denial, Ranma could see that her heart wasn't in it. Her arguments were already crumbling under the weight of their own dishonesty.</p><p>"I saw the fight, Akane. There's no way Nabiki could land a hit on you, even with your handicap."</p><p>Akane stopped protesting and sat silently for a moment, her hands wrapped around her cup, staring out at the rain that was now falling, "Honestly? I did it because I miss Nabiki. We used to train together all the time. Every day. I would never say this to her, but I was even a little glad when Kuno started picking on her because we got to spend so much time together in the dojo. And now, she's at cram class all the time and soon she'll be going off to college. Heck, she doesn't even have to fight the boys anymore. Why should she train? I just wanted to, I dunno, give her a thrill. I hoped it would get her back into the dojo."</p><p>As Akane stopped, Ranma thought about what she had said, "It's tough, losing a training partner like that. I know."</p><p>Akane turned to look at Ranma, "Yeah, of course you do. So what do I do now?"</p><p>"That's a hard one. Maybe you should look at losing Nabiki as a partner kind of like a training trip. You get yourself out of the place where you're comfortable and you get better. You do it for the art."</p><p>"But I don't want to leave Nabiki behind. Everyone comes back home, Ranma. At some point, you have to, right?"</p><p>Ranma looked back at Akane. The light from the street reflected off of the rain and burnished her hair a dark copper, but her eyes were still in shadows. "I dunno. I guess you just go and hope everyone is still there when you get back."</p><p>Akane nodded, turning her face away from Ranma and looking out at the koi pond.</p><p>4:36AM is not a time known for its excitement. Babies have a fondness for that time of night, especially when it concerns fussing and screaming, but their bleary eyed parents generally manage to keep things low key. Bars may do a brisk business after midnight by and large, but most of their remaining patrons can be counted on, though, to keep their cool as they struggle to find a one-night stand at last call. Things generally pick up at the few emergency rooms around Nerinma when the crazies hit the streets, but again, ER docs are in the business of quashing chaos, not creating more. The middle of the night is a time for sleep, a time for late night soul searching and a time for infomercials. Unfortunately for Ranma Saotome, 4:36AM is also a good time for vengeance.</p><p>"Wake up Ranma. It's me—Ryoga."</p><p>Ryoga stood up in Ranma's room, poised above his enemy's sleeping form. It had been a simple task to break into the Tendo home. Well, not exactly simple. The house itself had provided a challenge, but Ryoga had managed to navigate to Ranma's room at long last. But now, here Ryoga was, poised on the brink of retribution and Ranma stubbornly refused to wake up. Ryoga nearly spat. It was so difficult to exact revenge in a satisfying manner when one's quarry was sleeping like an angel. A goofy, disheveled angel, but still.</p><p>"Fight me! Hey Ranma!" Ryoga began to get annoyed and cocked his fist back, "Hey, would you wake up!"</p><p>But as Ryoga's strike crashed down, Ranma mumbled and rolled to the side, deftly avoiding the blow. Ryoga found his fist imbedded in a drool soaked pillow. He curse and tried again, but Ranma's dream addled brain was still too quick, and Ryoga missed again.</p><p>"WAKE UP DAMMIT!"</p><p>Ranma snapped bolt upright in bed. He was rewarded with a fist across his jaw that sent him crashing through the window and out into the rain slick yard. As Ranma plummeted towards the pond, he caught a glimpse of Ryoga sailing out after him. Then the world went black momentarily.</p><p>"What the hell?" Ranma sputtered, coming to the surface of the pond.</p><p>Ryoga stood back holding his umbrella over his head. It was ideal to face Ranma as a woman; to let him know exactly the depths of suffering that Ryoga himself had undergone. Plus, Ryoga added silently, it would make the fight easier to deal with an opponent who had shorter legs and arms. Ranma was going down!</p><p>Ranma shoved an errant carp off of her stomach and stood up. "Ryoga! It's the middle of the night. What are you doing?"</p><p>"Silence! Does revenge know day or night?"</p><p>"Would you cut this out? You've got nothing to get revenge for!"</p><p>"I'll say one thing before I send you to hell." A sudden rumble of thunder punctuated Ryoga's words. In the eerie silence that followed, his voice grew soft and bitter. "When you ran out on our duel, I followed you, all the way to China!"</p><p>Another fork of lightening illuminated the yard, throwing Ryoga's face into harsh relief. Ranma stood dumbstruck, as if the flash had burned out his ability to think clearly. Why was Ryoga holding an umbrella? There was something here, something important: umbrella…China and rain and umbrella.</p><p>Ranma raised a hand to her mouth, "Don't tell me you went to the ground of accursed springs? And that you transform into something when you get wet?"</p><p>Ryoga's anger burned white hot, stoked by Ranma's causal ignorance. He couldn't take it anymore; Ranma would have to die! Ryoga launched himself into the air, "Silence! The time for talking is past!"</p><p>Akane rolled over in bed and pushed herself up. What the hell was all that racket? She tried to throw the covers off, but there were none. They were balled up in the far corner of the room. At least nothing in the room was broken, Akane thought to herself, glancing around. A knock at the door caused Akane to look up.</p><p>"Hey Akane, you awake?" said Nabiki, poking her head in through the door.</p><p>"Yeah, did you hear that noise?"</p><p>"That's why I came in here. What do you think it is?"</p><p>"I dunno, let's go check it out."</p><p>Outside, Ranma and Ryoga were locked in midair battle. They each struggled furiously, jockeying for any advantage. Ranma's ribs still ached, but he felt confident that he could take down Ryoga once he got close enough for a strike with the Apian Fist. It was just a matter of time.</p><p>A flickering of red light off to the side brought Ranma up short. Still cognizant of his enemy, Ranma leapt to safe distance and threw up his hands. "Stop Ryoga! Seriously, something's going on in the dojo."</p><p>Ryoga landed a few yards away from Ranma and glared at him. "No tricks. You won't delay my vengeance!"</p><p>"Ryoga shut up! I think the dojo's on fire."</p><p>Ryoga hazarded a quick glance off to the side and he saw that Ranma was right. There was thick black smoke pouring from the open door. And even through the rain, Ryoga could see tongues of flame licking the timbers within.</p><p>"So what?"</p><p>"There are people inside the house…" Just as Ranma began, a man stepped through the blaze and out of the dojo door. Ranma's jaw dropped open. It was no ordinary man! He was taller, by at least a foot than any man Ranma had ever seen and he was dressed in archaic armor that glowed red gold in the firelight. Unsure of what to do, Ranma ran over in front of the dojo, cutting the man off. Ranma noticed, off handedly, that Ryoga followed.</p><p>"Hey buddy, this ain't a public space."</p><p>Ranma nearly froze as the man's gaze raked over the yard. The giant's eyes were entirely black, deep and oily as tar, framed by a severely scarred face. His white hair hung limp, soaked by the rain. "Stay back, girl child."</p><p>"Yeah? Or else what?"</p><p>The giant stopped and stared down at Ranma. Without warning an armored boot lashed out, catching Ranma on the chin and sending her sprawling backwards. Ryoga stepped to the side as Ranma came to a rest in the mud next to him.</p><p>"You have the nicest friends," laughed Ryoga, looking down at Ranma's supine form. Ryoga could see blood and rain mixing together from the gash that had been opened up on the redhead's jaw.</p><p>"Just stay out of the way while I handle this ogre. I need…oh, shit!" Ranma's eyes went wide and she rolled away.</p><p>Ryoga's gaze snapped up to the sky and he gasped. The giant, despite his bulk, had leapt high into the air and was descending with a wicked looking sword drawn. Ryoga threw himself aside, but before the attack came there was a loud crash. Both Ranma and Ryoga turned back to look as the giant was knocked askew by a heavy iron weight. Unprepared as he was, the armored man crashed through the tall garden wall and landed in a pile of rubble.</p><p>"Who the hell are you?" Akane shouted from the porch, her arm still poised from throwing the weight. Both she and Nabiki were dressed in their pajamas, but Akane looked ready for battle none the less.</p><p>"Who dares?" the giant shouted from the rubble. Akane was shocked as the enormous man stood up and dusted himself off, apparently unharmed. The giant locked his black eyes onto Akane and Nabiki. "Ah, I see, the heirs. How convenient. I was planning on murdering you in your sleep, but I think this will send a much nicer message."</p><p>With that, the giant reached back into the leather satchel he had flung over his shoulder and withdrew a scroll case. Akane immediately recognized the markings on the holder. It was one of the iron and bone cases her father used when he went on a trip. She started to say something, but stopped as the giant withdrew the scroll and unceremoniously tore it in half. With almost casual disdain, he flung the tatters down into the yard. Without another word, the giant leapt up and away, disappearing into the rainy night.</p><p>Everyone moved to follow the giant, but as they did, a sound like the buzzing of a thousand wasps filled the yard. All eyes were drawn to the source of the sound, the remains of the scroll. As if by some unseen force, the damp remnants began to tear themselves into hundreds and hundreds of tiny pieces. As the pieces shredded themselves furiously, the sound grew louder and louder until all the teens were covering their ears. The swirling, chaotic maelstrom in the center of the yard spasmed outward and then suddenly coalesced.</p><p>In place of the torn paper stood a monster of nightmarish dimensions. The form of a fiendish hyena had been melded unnaturally with the wings and talons of a vulture. Weird, alien antennae extended out from around the creature's head, sampling the air with maleficent intent. The stench of carrion poured out into the yard as it opened its fangs and let out a brutal, grunting laugh.</p><p>"What the hell is that thing?" Ryoga demanded, turning towards Ranma and Akane. He noticed that the other girl, presumably Akane's sister, turn in fear and run back into the house.</p><p>"I dunno. Akane?"</p><p>"I have no idea." Akane said, her voice betraying more than a little of the terror she was feeling. She hardly noticed Nabiki slip back through the screen door inside. "I think maybe we should…Oh god, Ryoga look out!"</p><p>Ryoga's head whipped around as the beast charged forward, its' incredible speed belying its bulk. Ryoga, though, was a consummate warrior and he had time to toss off a few of his bandannas before the monster smashed into him, sending him slamming in to the wall. Ryoga's umbrella glanced off the wall and came to rest over him, covering his body from the rain.</p><p>Ranma was still unsure what to do, but the violence that unfolded before him crystallized his thinking. In a split second, Ranma was airborne, corkscrewing his body around and smashing into the monster. As he landed, Ranma ducked a wicked claw swipe and sent his hand slashing forward. One of the antennas on the beast's head snapped off and black, ichorish fluid poured out from the wound. Ranma yelped and threw himself backwards to avoid being sprayed. The creature howled in pain and leapt forward, knocking Ranma down. Sharp claws dug into the ground around Ranma's hands and he found himself pinned.</p><p>The reek of rotting flesh and worse assaulted Ranma as the beast leaned down and opened it's horrible, slavering jaws just above his throat. Up close, Ranma could see that patches of fur and feathers were sloughing off of the creature, only to be replaced by a hideous whitish fungus. The beast's eyes still shown with malign intelligence as it barked out another laugh.</p><p>"Come on nasty! Do your worst!" Ranma shouted up defiantly.</p><p>The beast drew back its head for the fatal blow, but then suddenly tensed as Akane landed astride its shoulders. Without any hesitation, Akane shouted 'Kachū Tenshin Amaguriken' and let her fists fly. The beast roared with defiance and reared back, flapping its wings and whipping its head around, trying to reach the attacker. Ranma, now freed, vaulted to his feet and shoulder checked the creature's exposed underbelly, tipping it backwards.</p><p>As the monster crashed down, Akane kicked off its neck to safety. Ranma, for his part, backed away quickly and ran over to the place where Ryoga had fallen, still keeping an eye on the fiend. Reaching down, Ranma began to move the umbrella to the side but then stopped. Ranma realized that he had no idea what Ryoga actually transformed into and now was not the time to find out. Instead, Ranma squeezed her petite form under the umbrella and found that Ryoga was unconscious.</p><p>"WAKE UP DAMMIT!" Ranma shouted, slapping Ryoga across the face and paying him back for earlier in the evening.</p><p>"What the hell?" Ryoga's eyes snapped open and he found himself face to face with a soggy red head. As Ryoga started to get up he felt a restraining hand on his chest.</p><p>"It's still a bit damp out, if you catch my meaning." Ranma said, slipping back out from under the umbrella.</p><p>As Ryoga and Ranma stood, they found that Akane was trying to take on the monster single handedly. With nearly superhuman speed, Akane was dodging around tooth and claw, slipping into range and landing a barrage of strikes. The beast snapped its jaws, nearly severing Akane's arm, but she was too quick. Still, it seemed like an even battle. The monster couldn't catch Akane, but her blows seemed to have almost no effect. Just as Ranma and Ryoga made a move to rejoin the fight, Akane slipped on the wet grass and the beast lashed out with its cruel talons, shredding the night shirt around Akane's legs.</p><p>In a heartbeat, Ranma was next to Akane, scooping her up and leaping back to safety just as the monster struck again. As Ranma landed next to Ryoga, she looked down at Akane's wounds. There were three parallel scratches running across Akane's upper leg; one of them was wet with blood. Suddenly, Ranma became acutely aware that her right hand was gripping Akane's bare thigh. Ranma blushed profusely and set Akane down. None of the three teens noticed Nabiki slip out of the house in a wet blanket and run full on into the blazing dojo.</p><p>The hyena monster paused to lick the blood off of its talons and giggle horribly.</p><p>"We need a plan," Ryoga said glancing from the monster to the two girls.</p><p>"I don't know, the thing is so fast and it seems like it's impervious to damage," observed Akane, still keeping an eye on the monster.</p><p>"I think I could use the Apian fist on it," Ranma said, peering through the rain. "Oh, god, that looks so gross. Its chi meridians look like, uh, like worms are eating it from the inside out. I think I'm going to be sick."</p><p>"Pull it together girly," Ryoga said with distain. "Can you hurt it?"</p><p>Ranma swallowed down her rising gorge. "Yeah, I think I could."</p><p>"Good, then you'll need a distraction. Come here." Akane said as she beckoned both Ranma and Ryoga closer. "Here's what we'll do…"</p><p>Akane, still unsure about whether or not her plan would work, swallowed and grabbed onto Ryoga's hand. She summoned up her remaining courage and shouted, "Hey ugly! Come and get it!"</p><p>The monster's head snapped to attention just as Ryoga gripped both of Akane's hands and pivoted in a full circle, hurling Akane like a one-handed Olympic hammer. Akane spun in midair so that she was driving head-on into the creature's waiting jaws. But Akane had no intention of becoming a hyena snack. In the split second before she was torn to ribbons, Akane lashed out with both of her hands, driving her ridged fingers into the monster's eyes. At the exact same time, dozens of Ryoga's bandannas sliced through fur and feathers, spraying torrents of black blood. The damage inflicted by the bandannas confused the creature and allowed Akane to leap to safety.</p><p>The monster roared in terrible pain and Ranma choose that moment to attack from behind. His claws flashed with deadly precision, striking point after point. On the surface, there were no injuries, but Ranma could see the terrible damage he was wreaking beneath the skin. The monster twisted and writhed as one after another dark meridian was severed at the root. It tried to lash out at its attacker, but blind and wounded as it was, Ranma was able to dissect it quickly and precisely. As Ranma finished, Ryoga walked over and calmly withdrew his belt, snapping it out to rigidity.</p><p>"I always get my vengeance." Ryoga said, looking at Ranma as he sliced through muscle and bone, decapitating the monster.</p><p>As Akane joined Ranma and Ryoga, all three teens stood over the creature's body, unsure of what to do. This was no nightmare; the rain soaking into the beast's horrific hide brought home the reality of the thing they had faced. There would be no waking up.</p><p>Akane spoke first. "Should we burn it?"</p><p>"In this weather?" Ryoga asked.</p><p>"Maybe we should call your parents?" Ranma asked, nudging the body with his foot.</p><p>"Nice thought, Saotome, but you're a little late." Nabiki panted as she arrived. She was still wrapped in a damp blanked, but her face and hands were covered in soot. "Kick that head over here, would you Ryoga? And then bring the umbrella."</p><p>"Um, sure." Ryoga said, rolling the hyena head with his foot like a misshapen soccer ball.</p><p>As Ryoga brought the head over, Nabiki crouched down under his umbrella so that she was right over the body. "Ugh, god this thing stinks. Just a little closer. Make the head touch. Now, Daddy said the scroll has to be on the fatal wound."</p><p>As the head squished up against the severed stump of the neck, Nabiki withdrew a long, blank piece of paper from the blanket and pulled it open. She placed the scroll down so that it covered the place where the flesh was ragged and torn. Blood began to soak through the paper. After a few heart beats, the monster began to grow insubstantial and dark, like thick smoke. Rather than dispersing, though, the black smoke flowed onto the scroll and condensed down into arcane runes. Even the blood that had sprayed onto Akane's night gown and into the yard ran onto the scroll. Soon, there was nothing left but a few piece of torn up turf to indicate that anything amiss had happed in the Tendo's yard.</p><p>Nabiki stood up and wound the scroll firmly. After she had it safely tucked under her arm, she pulled the blanked tighter around herself. "Let's go inside. Daddy is probably still on the phone. We need to talk to him."</p><p>Author's notes:</p><p>Didn't see that one coming, did you? I have been planning this little twist for a while and it was a blast to finally write it. This is the point where this story will break from the cannon's plot in a serious way. I really hope you liked it and there will be more to come. Cheers!</p><p>Always remember to take it easy!</p><p>C+C welcome and appreciated.</p>
