</div>Since she had been young, Akane Tendo had been around the world in her pursuit of martial excellence. She had traveled the length and breadth of her own land. She had been across the sea and to the peaks of the highest mountains. She had been lost within sacred forests of India and run wild across the plains of America. In her travels, she had seen and done things that would astound a more normal person. But never once, in all her memory, had she had she been so completely amazed by something as simple as a story. She sat, cross-legged and listened with rapt attention to the tale of two men setting out for a foreign land, with no money and only the barest hints of where they would go and what they would do. With only a desire to better themselves martially, the two had fought and run their way across the most populous nation in world. Along the way they encountered things that made Akane herself gasp with amazement. Their struggles were so bizarre and, eventually, so disastrous that Akane found herself nearly at a loss for words. Yet, as she sat in her own living room, in mundane Nerinma Japan, and listened to the saga of Ranma Saotome and his father, there was only one thing she could say:<p>"What a pair of idiots!"<p>*********<p>Bill presents:<p>Ranma ½, A Man's Woman<p>Part Three: How it is<p>*********<p>"Akane!" Kimiko Tendo admonished. Certainly, it was true that Genma Saotome had been less than brilliant in his execution of Ranma's training. In fact, she now considered the man nearly criminally negligent in the treatment of his progeny, but still, he daughter should have known to treat guests with more respect.<p>"Whaddaya mean, 'pair of idiots'? You think I wanted to lose my manhood, ya dumb tomboy?" Despite Kimiko's attempted preemption, Ranma was on his feet in a second, nearly shouting at Akane. He then turned and grabbed hold of Genma's collar. "It was this lazy tub of lard that dragged me there. I just wanted to train!"<p>Before Akane could even respond, Genma seemed to snap to life. He seized hold of his son's hand and began to twist, sharply. Normally, Ranma would have flown out of the open door and into the yard, but instead a restraining hand from Soun Tendo prevented it. Both Ranma and Genma's looked up to the patriarch as they found their hands immobilized in Soun's iron grip.<p>"Calm yourselves." Soun commanded to the room at large, a razor's edge of steel in his voice. There was a tense moment of muscle straining against muscle. Slowly, as it became clear that Soun would not give, both Saotomes relaxed and muttered their acquiescence. Soun released them and they returned to a sitting position across from the Tendos.<p>For long minutes, no one said a word. Ranma busied himself with ignoring Akane, who was, in turn, appeared to be too fascinated by her own fingernails to even notice the cold sideways looks the boy was attempting not to give her. In contrast to their sister, Kasumi and Nabiki were nearly bursting to talk to their guests. Kimko, seated next to her husband, immediately recognized the same look of inquisition in her daughter's eyes that she had seen earlier that day. It had been that look, the eyes of a cat sighting the movement of a particularly dim witted mouse, which had prompted the three elders to carefully craft a plan to introduce Ranma's "condition" to the Tendo girls. The girls were supposed to be given a chance to accustom themselves to Ranma and vice versa. Only after a suitable period of adjustment would the truth be shared. Unfortunately, that plan had been shot to hell. Even though Ranma had been bold enough to announce his condition to the household at large, the girls must not be given the chance to rake the father and son across the coals. It was still true that both families would need some time and space to adjust to each other. Kimiko again thanked her good luck that she had found Soun; her husband would handle things.<p>"Daughters" Soun said, "help your mother in the kitchen. Our guests could use some tea and I imagine that we should begin keeping hot water on hand."<p>Both of the older daughters looked crestfallen at the thought of leaving such interesting guests. Akane, on the other hand, cast a look of derision towards Ranma and his father and rose to her feet. "Just stay out of the bathroom, pervert."<p>Before Ranma could launch a suitably caustic reply, Akane had swept out of the room and beyond earshot.<p>*********<p>As the four women left the room, Ranma blew out a sharp breath. It was like being in the zoo, he thought, only in reverse. When the older two sisters had looked at him, he felt like a sideshow freak being gawked at. Mainly, though, he felt anger leveled at the youngest daughter. Calling him an idiot and a pervert! Who did she thing she was? That stupid tomboy had probably never taken a risk for sake of the Art. At that moment, Ranma was willing to swear that the dark eyed girl across from him didn't know the first thing about real training. And she had the nerve to laugh at him! And that's just what she was probably doing, he thought. Yeah, all those girls were probably having a great big laugh at the sex-changing freak! He had been a fool to think that he was welcome in this place. All he wanted was to go back to China and leave all this nonsense behind.<p>"I'm outta here!" Ranma said as he stood up and began to walk towards the door.<p>Soun turned to face his future son-in-law. "Please, sit Ranma. We have things to discuss."<p>"Like what?" Ranma asked belligerently, but again, the iron in Soun's voice compelled him to obey. So he remained where he was.<p>"As I'm sure you're father has told you," Soun began, casting a nod towards a subdued Genma, "the Tendo and Saotome clan's are bound by a pledge of honor to be joined through marriage. As the sole heir to the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts, that you are responsible for seeing that pledge through."<p>"I don't got time for marriage and fiancées and junk. I've gotta go back to China and get cured."<p>"The question of your cure weighs heavily on my mind as well. But, as your father explained it to me, all of your attempts to cure yourselves in China failed. Might I suggest a different strategy?"<p>"Yeah? What kinda strategy?"<p>"As with a seemingly unbeatable opponent, it is better to slow down and prepare. You need to find your center before throwing your self back into the fray again."<p>"Huh? Could you explain that in Japanese?" Ranma asked. His curiosity, however, had been piqued and, with his anger temporarily forgotten, Ranma sat down heavily. At that moment Genma rose up and turned to leave.<p>"Genma, please stay." Soun asked.<p>Genma did not turn as he slid open the screen. When he spoke his voice was surprisingly acidic, "I do not need to hear the same lecture twice, old friend."<p>Ranma watched, puzzled, as his father slid the door closed behind him.<p>Soun nodded slightly, as if conceding something and then turned from the door to Ranma. Before speaking, he withdrew a lighter from within the folds of his gi along with a well-worn pipe. With nimble fingers he packed down a pinch of tobacco and lit it. As he took the first long drag, he paused to gather his thoughts. "I was reminded earlier today of the Saotome Secret Technique. You are familiar with it?"<p>Ranma hesitated for a moment, still thinking of his father, "Yeah, I've used it once or twice."<p>"Motion, contemplation, and opposition." Soun hesitated for a moment to let his words sink in. "This curse has no obvious answer, correct? What better chance to put these principals to use."<p>Ranma leaned forward slightly, "Like how?"<p>"For starters, you are here, away from the heart of the problem. That is good. As for contemplation, why don't we start simply? Why don't you carry a thermos of hot water with you? It would facilitate the change back."<p>"I tried that for a while. I ain't dumb, ya know?"<p>Soun smiled slightly, "I never said you were, son. Why don't you start by telling me what you have tried?"<p>*********<p>As Kimiko entered the kitchen she saw her two eldest daughters had their heads together and were whispering furiously. They stopped abruptly as the curtain swished back into place. Akane, on the other side of the kitchen, was making tea in a manner that can only be described as possessed. Mumbles of pervert and freak interspersed themselves with the sounds of china clinking as the youngest daughter smashed cups and saucers down on a tray.<p>"Akane!" The whisper was sharp and carried with it no uncertain disapproval.<p>At that moment the target of the whisper was so caught up in the throws of righteous annoyance that it took her a moment to register who was speaking and to control her voice appropriately, "I'm sorry mother. Its just that he saw  tricked us!"<p>"As I understand it," Kimiko said, fixing all three of her daughters with a questioning look, "you walked in on him."<p>It was Kasumi who answered, "As Akane said, we were led to believe that Ranma was a girl. We didn't mean to walk in on him."<p>"I don't really think anyone is as fault here." Nabiki added.<p>"What about the pervert?" Akane said incredulously, turning to face her sister.<p>"Akane, think about it for a second." Nabiki said, her voice taking on an almost scholarly tone. "You're raised as this uber-macho kung fu king and all of a sudden you turn into a girl. Your gonna have a gender role nightmare of Freudian proportions. Of course he didn't come right out and say, 'Hey, I'm an aquatransexual.'"<p>"But still, he should have stayed out of the."<p>"Girls! I think we are all aware of the lack of transparency in the actions of the Saotomes. What concerns me now is the behavior of my own children. This is a trying time for all involved, but your father and I will work things out. What I want from you girls is your solemn promise to treat the Saotomes as guests. Do you understand? Give them space and treat them politely. And for heaven's sake, no questions! Now please, go upstairs."<p>"Yes mother." The three answered together.<p>As the three exited, Kimiko noticed Akane tap Nabiki on the shoulder and ask her something softly.<p>*********<p>"The thing is, you don't really get the curse."<p>Soun sighed. He had to hand it to Ranma, the boy had been quite innovative in his search for a cure. Souns hope for an immediate solution had been faint, but it was still disconcerting to have it dashed. "By all means, explain what I am lacking."<p>Ranma placed his hands on his knees and leaned forward slightly, "The biggest problem is that I turn into a girl, right? Nope. It took me a while to notice, but after I started thinking about it, the real curse became kinda clear."<p>It was Soun's turn to have his interest piqued, "Go on."<p>"To make a long story short, I'm a trouble magnet. I mean, if there's even the smallest chance that I can get splashed, it's a good as certain. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. If it's more embarrassing or dangerous for me to be a girl, it's going to be cold water. But lets say I'm in the girl's bathroom, not that I have any reason to be there, but I'm definitely gonna get splashed with hot water. All across China people got the wrong idea about things. People fell in love with me, challenged me, tried to kill me, and generally made Pop and me as miserable as they could and the curse was helping them every step of the way."<p>"That sounds fairly far fetched, son." Sound said, tapping out his pipe.<p>"Just think about it. Wouldn't it have saved everybody a headache if I had been scrubbing down with cold water when your daughters came in to the bathroom? Wouldn't it have been simpler if Pop and me had shown up as men in the first place? But there's no way that was going to happen. If it hadn't been raining, we'd have gotten sprayed with a hose or drenched with water balloons, or a fire hydrant would have burst or."<p>"Ranma! Stop! I agree that coincidence upon coincidence is rather suspicious, but at this moment we are getting nowhere. For now, let us focus on the root of the problem, or even better, my father had a saying, 'think of the solution not the problem.' Now tell me, what would solve this problem?"<p>"Well, being cured, but I already told ya, we tried that."<p>"That is a start, but think, simply, what would keep you from transforming?"<p>Ranma rubbed his forehead and sat back for a moment. He knew that there was something that Soun Tendo wanted him to find, something that he was missing. Maybe he was trying to hard, he thought. What if it were something really basic? "What  if I didn't get wet?"<p>"Now that is a thought." Sound said, a grin creeping across his sharp features. "How can you keep from getting wet?"<p>"I could dodge the water. Or, if it couldn't touch me, if it evaporated or froze into ice."<p>The grin swept into a full-blown smile. "Very clever, those last two suggestions had not occurred to me. For now, though, we should work on having you simply avoid water. Do you understand?"<p>"Yeah, I should practice dodging."<p>"Not just dodging, but awareness. That is the key." Soun stood up and began pacing the room. It was this sort of situation that he lived for. An opponent, any opponent, had presented a problem. It was a sensei's joy to help his student find the solution. But more than that, a true teacher should be there to see the student through to the end. Soun wanted a cure for his future son-in-law, that was sure, but more than that he wanted to help Ranma beat this problem. "You should be able to feel the water, know where it could come from at any moment. I think we can come up with some interesting drills to help you. Are you up for it?"<p>"Yes." Ranma answered.<p>"Good. I will consult the Tendo family library for ideas on your last two suggestions."<p>Having said that Soun nodded politely and turned to leave. As he was sliding the screen open, Ranma stopped him, "Mr. ."<p>"Your quite welcome, my boy."<p>*********<p>"What was with all that psychobabble downstairs?" Akane asked as she shut the door to Nabiki's room.<p>Nabiki took her time before answering, clearing off her bed before collapsing down on her back and ending up with an arm thrown across her eyes. "You're right, sis, it was psychobabble. But that doesn't mean it was wrong."<p>Akane still stood just inside the room, eyeing her sister critically. Nabiki had obviously thought about the problem Ranma represented and it was still bugging her. She leaned one shoulder against the wall and then began to examine the bookshelf across the room. The titles were different, but the subject matter was nearly all the same: "Women's Empowerment" this or "Re-examining the patriarchy" that. Nabiki had become a veritable one-woman army of feminism is the past few years. She had a mountain of books in Japanese and even some in English. For a teenage, girl it was just too weird. It wasn't that Akane disagreed with feminism per se, but in her mind, most of these writers were full of hot air.<p>"Doesn't it seem odd to you, just to talk about being as good as a man rather than going out at doing it?" Akane asked derisively.<p>Nabiki rolled over onto her stomach so she was facing Akane and smiled wickedly, "Still mad that you couldn't beat Ranma? Don't take it out on me."<p>"I could beat that pervert any day!"<p>Nabiki twisted the knife a little deeper, "Even when he's a boy."<p>"Shut up!" Akane said, this time with a real trace of acid in her voice.<p>Nabiki's evil grin dissolved into fits of equally evil giggles "Oh Akane, you are so easy to , seriously, wait," Nabiki rose off of the bed as Akane turned to leave.<p>Akane stopped, "Just tell me what you and Kasumi were talking about downstairs."<p>"We were just discussing how rough things were for Ranma, what with his father and the curse and all."<p>"He's still a moron."<p>"Maybe, but its easy to see why he act the way he does. Like I said, Ranma's been inundated with all this macho, super dominant male bullshit. He thinks he's the alpha wolf and suddenly, bam, he's the girl next door. His ego had the rug pulled out from under it."<p>"Do you really believe all of that?"<p>"Akane, culture and gender aren't just words, they are very real things that have very real consequences in our lives. They can force us to do things we don't want to do, and we may not even realize what's making us unhappy. You don't get that because you fit perfectly into this whole neat little world Mom and Dad have planned out for you."<p>"Oh yeah, its super easy to have Mom riding me for not studying enough and then Daddy busting me for not practicing 12 hours a day on my martial arts."<p>"That's just it, though. Mom and Dad are taking you where you want to go. You want to be the best in school and in the dojo and that's what they're making you. But Ranma doesn't have any choice now. He wants to be a man's man but all he gets is a cold-water castration!"<p>"Its no more than that pervert deserves. Why do you keep sticking up for him?"<p>Nabiki didn't answer right away. Instead, she rolled over again, so she was facing away from Akane. Finally, after an antagonizing silence, Nabiki said, in a small voice, "Because I know what's its like to have your choices made for you."<p>Akane stood for another minute, just looking across the room at Nabiki. Her sister looked small, curled up in the corner of her bed, like the self- assuredness that normally filled her up had leaked out when she had spoken. Then something struck Akane: she wasn't angry anymore. Not at Nabiki, and not even at Ranma. Her sister had said something very private and very painful, and somehow it had taken all of the anger and turned it into a dull ache in Akane's chest.<p>Akane walked over to the bookshelf and selected a title at random. She tossed the book next to Nabiki before going to bed. "Here sis."<p>*********<p>Ranma was deliriously happy. He had just defeated Jin Te Quan, the number one fighter in southern China, if not the world. In doing so he had not only captured the All China Martial Arts championship, but also a huge cash prize and a cure for his curse. As the announcer grasped his hand and held it aloft, he looked out into the audience of tens of thousands of screaming fans and saw that they only had one name on their lips.<p>"Ranma! We have to train. Wake the hell up!"<p>Akane's none-too-subtle wake-up call was accompanied by a large bucket of water, which landed on the disoriented Saotome. For just a moment lay still, waiting for the change to occur, but when the familiar tingle didn't come, he opened one sleep-blurred eye and saw that his chest was as flat as a board. The water was warm!<p>Warm water or no, he wasn't about to let any tomboys get away with interrupting his sleep. "Hey you stupid, good-for-nothing, ugly." Ranma stopped abruptly when he was merely addressing an open window. That chick was toast!<p>*********<p>Author's Notes:<br/>Sorry it took so long to get this chapter out. If anyone ever tells you that graduate school is easy, you spit in their eye and tell them Bill said to. On another, non-spit, note: I think the stuff with Nabiki got a little more serious than I intended it. That's cool, because I am trying to just write this and let it be what it's going to be, but I like the light hearted stuff a little better. Finally, I would say that I'm going to try to be more regular, but I am starting the medical part of my combined degree, so time is going to be a little thin on the ground. Oh  next time,<p>Always remember to take it easy!
