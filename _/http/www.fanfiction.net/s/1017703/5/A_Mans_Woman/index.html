</div><p>Akane awoke quickly and completely. Her blankets were thrown aside. Her pajamas entirely wrinkled. She had even managed to kick down a shelf in her closet. Again. Still, she had always been a morning person and she attributed it to the way she awoke. The transition from sleep to waking was like a homecoming, soft and welcoming, far different from the way she slept. That was not to say that the morning didn't hold any other pleasures. There was a certain satisfaction she found in walking softly through a sleeping house, hearing the birds begin to rouse themselves and brewing tea in the darkness before dawn. It was also a time that afforded the perfect opportunity for stalking one's prey. She crept slowly towards Ranma's room. His father was probably also asleep, but Akane felt sure that she could strike accurately enough with cold water to leave Mr. Saotome unperturbed. Akane felt a delicious sense of power as she snuck a peek through the slight opening in the doorway. Ranma would never know what hit him. Unfortunately for Akane, the water bucket perched atop the door couldn't have been more perfectly placed.</p><p>Bill presents:</p><p>Ranma ½, A Man's Woman</p><p>Part Five: Like it or lump it</p><p>Ranma stopped short. There was light peeking out from under the large doors of the dojo. Perhaps Nabiki had woken up a little early to train. For Ranma, though, there was normally only one person who beat him to the dojo in the morning. Ranma knew that he had mere seconds before Akane would come careening around the corner. Ranma's father had been in a foul mood last night and if he was training, Ranma didn't want to disturb him. His mind made up, Ranma gently pushed one of the doors and peeked around.</p><p>"You had better be ready for the fight of your life…" Akane shouted as Ranma's back came into sight.</p><p>"Shhhhh." Ranma hissed, turning back sharply with his finger pressed to his lips. There was something in his face that brought Akane to a full stop the moment before she collided with him.</p><p>"What do you mean, 'shhhh,'?" Akane asked, her voice low but insistent.</p><p>Ranma took her face away from the door and stepped aside, "See for yourself." He whispered.</p><p>Akane pressed her eye to the crack between the two doors. Inside her father and Genma Saotome stood across the dojo floor from one another, unmoving. Both were clearly in fighting stances: Genma faced to the side with his hands held rigidly in the Tiger claw position. Soun, in contrast, had adopted a low Crane crouch, relaxed but ready. Neither spoke, but the air between them was thick and heated. Each man was clearly poised on the edge of imminent violence. To Akane, the moments seemed to stretch out as he waited for the two to begin.</p><p>"Akane, why don't you and Ranma come in here?" Soun asked quietly, never taking his eyes off of Genma.</p><p>"Um, ok, yeah." Akane jumped. She looked to Ranma questioningly, but he merely shrugged and gestured her on. Akane's hands were unsure as she pushed the door open a fraction more, so she and Ranma could pass inside. They both moved quietly off to the side of the dojo and sat down. Neither Ranma nor Akane made any move towards the judging flags; this would not be a sparring match.</p><p>Without warning, Genma started forward. His opening, a lunging kick, was deceptively simple, but it clearly hid a myriad of possible follow ups. Soun stepped back and intercepted the majority of the incoming attacks, but found himself clipped by a devastating right hand. Genma pressed his advantage and seized hold of Soun's lapel, jerking the smaller man off his feet. Soun kept his head admirably and managed to swing his foot around into Genma's jaw before hitting the ground. Both men rolled away from the point of contact only to shoot back at one another with renewed vigor.</p><p>Ranma was amazed. He had seen his father fight a thousand times or more, but this time the old man was really going all out. This training buddy must have brought out some scrap that the tub of lard had been holding in reserve. The two combatants were fighting tooth and nail, and his father was pushing himself to the absolute limit. There were techniques at play here that Genma had barely touched on while training Ranma; grappling, infighting, chi attacks, and even more things that Ranma hadn't thought his father capable of. What was even more astounding was Akane's father. Soun Tendo had absorbed a tremendous amount of damage. Even now, the man's breath was failing, yet he continued to put up a tremendous fight. Still, there was no denying which branch of Anything Goes had produced the finer fighter.</p><p>"Had enough, old friend?" Genma smiled as he danced in front of a panting Soun.</p><p>"Ha. I'm just getting warmed up." Soun retorted, his words more convincing than his stance.</p><p>Genma shot in and snatched Soun's legs out from under him, sending him crashing to the ground. Midway though the fight Genma had begun to realize just how satisfying it was to be able to toy with Soun, to see how much the extra training and hardship had paid off. Anything Goes was a demanding art, he thought to himself, but it rewarded the faithful. "You've spent too much time living the good life at home."</p><p>Soun pushed himself to his feet and shook the sweat out of his matted hair. "And you don't realize how I've gained from staying here with my family."</p><p>And with that, Akane realized, her father had caught his second wind. Soun leapt upwards and brought his fist crashing down onto Genma forehead. The fat man was stunned momentarily, but it was more than enough time for Soun to tap two pressure points on Genma's chest. Akane winced as she thought about the kind of pain Ranma's father was probably in right now. That was the kind of fighting her father was known for: quick, decisive and devastating. She had been surprised at the shear ferocity of Genma's attacks, not to mention the brilliance and adaptability he had shown. Her father had not been challenged seriously for some time and it plainly showed. Still, as the fight continued, it was hard to predict the outcome between two men of such flawless technique.</p><p>"Give it up, Saotome." Soun said as he grabbed hold of Genma's wrists and swung his forehead towards the larger man's face.</p><p>Heedless of Soun's grip, Genma flung his arms wide and released an explosion of electric blue energy that blasted Soun away. "You could never beat me before! What makes you think that today is your day?"</p><p>Soun tumbled through the air and smashed against the support beam in the corner of the dojo, sending splinters everywhere. He lay still for a moment, but then his eyes snapped open "Because I've mastered the true art of Anything Goes and you haven't." Soun said, struggling to his knees.</p><p>Genma stalked forward coldly. "So that's what this is about? The questioning, the lectures, and the 'match' this morning? You think you should be the one to train the heir to the Anything Goes School."</p><p>"Shouldn't I?" Soun said as he finally regained his footing and sent a trio of glowing, chi-charged splinters towards the closing Genma.</p><p>Genma soared over the projectiles with an ease that belied his bulk, only to twist in mid-leap and bring his elbow to bear. "No, you fool!"</p><p>Soun attempted to block, but the elbow smashed through his defenses and opened a gash under his eye. Despite that, he managed to grab the still-airborne Genma around the waist and hurl him away. Soun stood panting as Genma righted himself before landing. Neither man made any move to reengage.</p><p>"I've been training Ranma ever since he was born. I understand the kind of sacrifice that the next generation needs to make to master Anything Goes." Genma growled.</p><p>"Why not let our skills decide?" Soun said. "The winner of this match will train Ranma and Akane for the next year. Anything Goes rules? Knockout only?"</p><p>Genma almost smiled through bared teeth, "On your honor, Tendo?"</p><p>"No. On the honor of our children." Soun said, finally taking his eyes off of Genma and fixing them steadily on Akane and Ranma.</p><p>Ranma and Akane sat stock still, momentarily stunned by the decision they were being presented with. It was Akane who spoke first, "If that's what you want Daddy."</p><p>Ranma glanced over at Akane. Her head was cast down towards the floor and hair fell over her face, but it looked as if her lower lip was trembling slightly. Ranma tore his eyes away from Akane and looked at their fathers. "Um, yeah, I guess it's ok. If that's what you guys decide and all."</p><p>"Then let it begin!" Genma shouted triumphantly, streaking towards Soun.</p><p>With almost casual ease, Soun sidestepped a pivoting kick, a twisting dual claw strike and the head butt that had been hidden within the charge. Gone was the sweaty, tired old man that Soun had been. His movements were quick and crisp, his speed: nearly inhuman. A rush of air was the only sound as Soun's knee planted itself in Genma's belly. Without waiting for an answer, Soun delivered a crushing elbow to the larger man's neck, which sent Genma to the floor.</p><p>Genma righted himself, shook his head and flew at the spot where Soun had been a moment before. The smaller man was no longer there. He hadn't been this fast or strong a moment ago. Genma was only allowed a moment of realization before Soun's foot descended on his temple. Genma's vision went dark briefly and a lightening barrage of blows impacted on his midsection. Each one struck a specific pressure point and blocked the flow of chi. In the instant after Genma's eyes cleared he found himself staring down at a glowing ball of golden energy that had just been released from Soun's palm. As Genma began to to fly away, Soun leapt out and snatched the larger man's foot, bringing him crashing back to the ground.</p><p>Ranma gasped at Soun Tendo's speed and savagery. His attacks were as fast, complex and destructive as anything Ranma had ever seen. They next few seconds were filled with the dull sound of bone repeatedly striking meat. Genma tried to counterattack, but in Ranma's eyes he really had no chance to regain his footing. Even if he had, it was clear that he was outclassed. Ranma wondered how he hadn't seen it from the beginning; there was really no comparing the two men. Soun had played Genma for a fool and now the fat man was paying.</p><p>Genma landed bonelessly on the floor, bleeding, bruised and unconscious. Soun Tendo hadn't just won: he had lured his opponent into a duel of honor and then crushed him, ground him down so that only dust remained. Soun's eyes were still blazing as he turned towards the children. "Do you both agree that I am the victor?"</p><p>Ranma couldn't take his eyes off of Genma's body. "Yes." He mumbled.</p><p>Akane agreed a split second later. She stared at Ranma. The blood had drained from his face.</p><p>"Will my dad be ok?"</p><p>"Your father will live. But I doubt he will forget his promise. You shouldn't either." Soun turned and walked out the dojo door.</p><p>Ranma didn't say another word as he crawled over to Genma's body. He numbly pressed his fingers against his father's neck. The old man had a pulse, albeit a weak one. His fingers came away sticky with blood. Ranma could see the chest rising and falling. His father was alive. Soun Tendo didn't seem like the type to kill someone, but a few minute ago he hadn't seemed like to type to beat someone half to death, either. Unsure of what to do, Ranma began to check the chi points that had been struck in the last part of the fight. Some seemed bruised, but others were burned or perhaps frost-bitten, he couldn't be sure. Ranma knew he was out of his depth here. The old man could be dying or cursed, or anything. Without realizing it, hot tears began to fall from Ranma's eyes. As he took a shuddering breath in, he felt a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Akane leaned over Ranma's back. "Let my mother take a look."</p><p>Kimiko walked quickly around to the other side of Genma's body and knelt down. Her gaze swept across the man and seemed to take in every detail. Ranma wasn't sure, but Mrs. Tendo might have muttered a curse under her breath. She placed her hands on Genma's chest and closed her eyes.</p><p>"What is she doing?" Ranma asked, turning to face Akane. He barely noticed that Akane had left her hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"She's healing him. She'll make your father better."</p><p>Ranma turned to look back at Kimiko Tendo. She continued to sit with her eyes closed for another minute. Slowly, a bluish glow began to accumulate around her hands. Ranma was still in shock over the fight and how it ended, but without meaning to, he noticed that Mrs. Tendo did not have the hands of a housewife. Her fingers were long and agile, like the hands of a piano player or a surgeon. Her knuckles, though, were callused like a fighter and she had several small scars and burns. Like the rest of the Tendo clan, there was more to the matriarch than met casual inspection, Ranma thought bitterly.</p><p>As is by some unseen signal, Kimiko's eyes snapped open and she went to work on Genma. To Ranma and Akane, she was a blur. She pushed joints back into place, re-aligned limbs and kneaded bruised muscles. Lancets of blue chi penetrated wounds and broke up injured tissue. The flow of energy was restored after one meridian after another till, at last, Genma appeared to be breathing comfortably. Kimiko stood and wiped her bloody hands on her apron.</p><p>"Akane, join me inside."</p><p>"But Mother, I want to stay…For Mr. Saotome."</p><p>"Now, Akane. I imagine Ranma has some thinking to do."</p><p>Ranma didn't turn to watch them go, but he could still feel where Akane squeezed his shoulder as she left.</p><p>As they walked back inside the house, Kimiko could feel the anger building up inside Akane. Her youngest daughter had always been a hot head. Sometimes martial arts seemed to channel that anger, but at other times it seemed to amplify Akane's rage. This time seemed to be one of the latter. Soun was a good man and there was much of him in Akane. Much that Kimiko herself admired. Right now, though, Akane and Soun could not be allowed to butt heads. Neither was in a mood for peaceful resolutions and a fight was unacceptable. Kimiko knew how to deal with Soun, but for Akane distraction was best.</p><p>"Daughter, I know that what you saw today was frightening, but…"</p><p>"Daddy nearly killed Mr. Saotome! He beat up someone much weaker and, what's worse, he tricked him. That fight wasn't at all honorable."</p><p>Kimiko was proud, despite the circumstances. The only thing she prayed for was a good moral compass in her girls, and clearly her prayers had been answered. "Akane, I appreciate what you are saying, but you don't understand the situation." Kimiko held up her hand to forestall protest. "And no, I will not make it clear to you right now."</p><p>"I will speak with your father now, and you may speak with him tomorrow. Right now I would like you to go see my partner for some training before school. It will clear your mind, and Dr. Tofu is expecting you to have mastered the chi stinger technique."</p><p>"Mother!" Akane said, but Kimiko cut her off again.</p><p>"I have spoken my piece and I expect to be obeyed. Is that clear?"</p><p>Kimiko watched the emotions play across Akane's features; anger, obedience, honor and even a trace of sympathy warred against one another. "Yes, mother." The last word was clipped. Kimiko almost permitted herself a small smile. Teenage angst was always the dark horse in such competitions.</p><p>Kimiko Tendo slid the screen door closed behind her. Even the small click it made sounded like a gun-shot in the silence of the room. Soun sat with his back to the doorway and Kimiko could see that he was holding something in his hands. As she walked around to sit next to her husband, she noticed that his eyes were red and raw, but dry. The photograph Soun was holding was an old black and white one. It showed two young men, their arms over each other's shoulders, dressed in ragged gi's. They were beaten and half-starved, but they both wore enormous grins. To Kimiko, these were men who looked like they had taken the worst the world could dish out and they were still hungry for more. Several places on the photo, however, were marred. Kimiko, being a certain sort of woman, was too polite to comment on the fresh tearstains.</p><p>"He was the one that kept me going." Soun said, more to himself than to his wife. "He had this way of making me laugh when things were at their worst. I would chuckle and everything would be a little better."</p><p>Kimiko bit back the obvious questions that leapt into her mouth. She felt as if she were in uncharted territory here. "Nodoka told me Genma used to say the same about you."</p><p>"I am reminded of one of the Master's training techniques, oddly enough. To increase our will, the Master would force us to march for days across a desert without any rations."</p><p>Kimiko sighed. The savagery her husband had endured during his training was appalling.</p><p>"During those times, Genma would keep telling me about the food that we would eat on the other side: steamed buns, cherry mochi, sweet rice balls. After all these years, I can still envision the taste. He made be believe that I would have them, that I would make it."</p><p>"It's not odd to think of the best in an old friend." Kimiko reached out her hand to cover Soun's wrist. She felt that he was shaking, holding back tears.</p><p>"This is not just about Genma, though. You have to understand about the Master, too." Soun said, some of the steel returning to his voice. "He was needlessly cruel, to be sure, but his fatal flaw was that he misunderstood the Art."</p><p>Kimiko swallowed hard. Some of the fire had returned to Soun's eyes. She wasn't afraid for her safety, but rather, she feared for the honor of her husband. When Kimiko had met him, Soun was not the most upright individual. Sweet and caring, of course, but without the iron will he had today. Then, slowly, almost so that she hadn't noticed, he had become a man of unshakable moral principles. His mastery of the Art had grown phenomenally during their relationship, but the real transformation was to be found in his character. Kimiko liked to think that she had merely uncovered the good man that had been waiting all along. When she saw Soun's anger, though, it dawned on Kimiko that he needed to explain his actions to her in order to justify them to himself. The responsibility of such a position crashed over her and, for a moment, she doubted herself up to the task. But years of marriage had not only strengthened Kimiko's belief in her husband, but also in herself. She took a deep breath and squeezed Soun's wrist, urging him to continue.</p><p>"The Master had his perversions and his vices. Those were things that made him strong, but they distracted him from mastery of the Art and he knew it. In us, his disciples, he attempted to remove those distractions. In his own sick way he tried to make us immune to the temptations of the world. We would be the students who felt no hunger, no pain, and no desire. We would have only the Art." Soun stood up and began pacing the room.</p><p>"Genma believed in the Master. He hated him, to be sure. But he thought that the Master's way was the right way. You have heard about the way he has treated Ranma? Dragging him away from his home and his family. Genma has told me other things over the past few days. He has let things slip. He made sure that the boy never grew comfortable, never made friends. Genma was trying to grind all the humanity out of his son. Ranma would only be left with the will to win. And I could not stand for it. I could not allow it."</p><p>"When I left the Master, I discovered something, and it has made all the difference."  Soun stopped pacing and turned back towards Kimiko. The photo slid from his fingers and drifted softly to the floor. His eyes had calmed and he went and knelt beside Kimiko, taking her hands. "Genma has tried to remove every distraction from Ranma's mastery of the Art. But a student trained in that way is a half-person. They are doomed to defeat right from the start. Think of our family. We fight and we love and we have built a life together; one that is filled up with such beautiful clutter. Our family gives me such strength that I cannot be distracted. Even the most perfect technique could not defeat me. I have learned one thing over these years and it is this: you don't keep a man from being hungry by starving him."</p><p>Kimiko could not stop herself. She felt hot tears well up in her eyes and she threw her arms around her husband.</p><p>Consciousness returned to Genma Saotome in waves. The first awareness was pain, and it crashed over him, threatening to drag him back under into senselessness, if only to escape. The second wave was gentler; he was in the Tendo's dojo, lying on the floor staring up at the ceiling. The third wave was barely more than a ripple, but it tore at him the worst of all. He had lost. Irrevocably. Genma had been weighed and measured and the sum of his skill had been found lacking. Genma had never expected that such cunning and ability lay dormant in his old training partner. Soun Tendo had become someone else entirely in the years they had been apart. And worst of all, he, Genma, had lost Ranma. Well, no, Genma thought to himself. A true martial artist never really loses; they just change the rules of the game.</p><p>Ranma was kneeling right next to Genma and saw his father's eyes open. Then, amazingly, Genma coughed and sat up. "Come on, my boy. We're leaving."</p><p>"Uh, now?" Ranma asked, looking at his father's battered form. "Don't you need to recover a little?"</p><p>"A true martial artist bears hardship with stoicism." Genma reminded his son. He wished he could live up to that saying as he groaned and tried to get up.</p><p>"But, ah, Dad…" Ranma placed an arm under Genma's bulk and attempted to lever his father into a standing position. "Where are we going to go?"</p><p>"We'll hit the open road, son. Nagano is a good place to train this time of year. Then we'll probably head back to China." Already a wild plan was forming in Genma's mind. They would travel the globe. Every stop would push them higher and higher. This would be the training trip to end all training trips. Ranma's skills would soar, and so would his own. They would be gone for a few years at least. Then, and only then, would he come back here and show Soun a thing or two.</p><p>"I dunno if that's such a good idea, Dad." Ranma saw the look in his father's eye and he took his arm off of Genma's back.</p><p>"Why not, boy? We've been here a few days. These people are no good. They are decadent and soft. Not true martial artists like you and I."</p><p>Ranma looked around the dojo and then down. "I don't think Akane's soft." He said quietly.</p><p>Genma's voice became low and dangerous. "So that's it then? This girl has her hooks in you and you're willing to throw the Art aside?"</p><p>"It ain't like that." Ranma said, shoving his father back. "She's just, I dunno, good."</p><p>"So what now?" Genma said angrily, pushing his finger into Ranma's chest. "You stay here and let the Tendo's tell you what's what?"</p><p>Ranma knocked his father's hand away. "Isn't that what you promised? Mr. Tendo is gonna train me from now on. That was your decision, not mine!"</p><p>"Well, I'm deciding now: we're leaving! Go grab your bag."</p><p>Ranma looked at his father. Genma was clenching his fists. Even with the beating he had taken, some battle aura was still sputtering to life. The old man looked ready to punch his lights out. Under that, though, under the pain and weariness, was something else. Ranma didn't think he could stand to find out what right now. "I'm gonna go to school. You should, like, lie down and rest. We'll talk when I get back."</p><p>Ranma turned and walked through the dojo door. Ranma didn't notice as Genma started forward for a moment, but then turned his back and sat down heavily.</p><p>Akane focused on her finger. She imagined that her entire mind, her entire being, was a razor sharp point extending outwards from that one place. She was the acumination of all energy, all being in the universe. Her mind was set so fine and so slender that, given half a chance, she would slip between the bonds of the very atoms around her. She was a needle, because she willed it so. Slowly, almost imperceptibly so, she extended her arm out towards the target.</p><p>"Bzzzzzzzzz!"</p><p>Akane slumped back into the waiting chair as the buzzer sounded on the stupid children's game. "Argh! I haven't got it yet."</p><p>Doctor Tofu patted Akane on the shoulder as he bustled about the practice. He brushed aside a curtain and filled a few herb jars next to Akane. "Don't get so discouraged. Look here." He indicated the small plastic piece inside of the board. It was shaped like a bone, but on one side there was a small black mark, as if it had been burned.</p><p>"I touched it?" Akane said, sitting up.</p><p>"Yes, and that is very good. But your chi stinger is not fine enough. You keep touching the sides. That's no way to win at the game of Operation!" Dr. Tofu laughed to himself.</p><p>"How much longer do you think I have before I master the chi stinger technique?" Akane sat up and shook out her hand.</p><p>"Well, you are progressing at a phenomenal rate, but there is a lot left to learn before you have it all."</p><p>"Like what?"</p><p>"You have mastered the fundamentals of pressure points, but there is so much more. Right now you are scratching the surface, literally. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of points below the surface of a person's body. Then there are the transformations for each of the 5 elements. Not to mention yin and yang portions of each transformation."</p><p>"Ugh. Is that all?" Akane asked sarcastically.</p><p>"That is why I am teaching you the Apian Fist. It is a shorter course than memorizing each point individually and it is much more damaging."</p><p>Without meaning to, Akane thought back to the fight earlier today. Akane found that she couldn't stop thinking about the wounds on Mr. Saotome's body. "Um, Dr. Tofu, does my dad know the Apian Fist?"</p><p>Dr. Tofu slid the board game over and sat down on the bed across from Akane. "No, no he doesn't. I've never seen it in action, but your mother mentioned something about the Poison Palm of the West. From the rumors I've heard, I know it is not a subtle technique, like the Apian Fist, but I cannot deny what I have been told about its effectiveness. Why do you ask?"</p><p>Akane looked up into Dr. Tofu's eyes and burst into tears. "Oh, Doctor!"</p><p>Ranma was so distracted that he hardly noticed Akane join him as they both rebounded off of Kuno's face in the school yard.</p><p>"Hey, don't fight my fights for me." Ranma said, trying to avoid Akane's gaze. If her eyes weren't tinged red with sadness, he might have actually succeeded.</p><p>"I wasn't doing it for you. Nabiki was a little sick this morning and I wanted to keep up appearances. Plus, it feels good." Akane attempted a small smile.</p><p>"Whatever." Ranma said. He shoved his hands in his pockets and walked into school.</p><p>Akane stood still and watched his Ranma walk away. She wasn't sure exactly what she could say to Ranma to make him feel better. Akane wasn't even sure how she felt about the fight this morning. On the one hand, her father had been brilliant and devastating; she should really feel proud of the Tendo School of Indiscriminant Grappling. On the other side, though, the fight hadn't really been fair and her father had known it. One of the main tenets of the Tendo School was to respect one's enemies and never take advantage outside of combat. But this morning her father had technically acted during the fight, sort of. All Akane knew was the feeling she had in her chest when she saw Ranma's face as his father went down. She felt sure that she never wanted to feel that way again. Her mind made up, Akane ran after Ranma's retreating form.</p><p>Author's notes:</p><p>Whew! That went a bit darker than I had intended. Still, I hope that I'm introducing the character dynamics in a new and interesting way. More to come on the Apian Fist. I have a lot of time right now, so chapters should come pretty regularly.</p><p>Always remember to take it easy!</p><p>Oh, and C+C always welcome. The more the better, I always say!</p>
