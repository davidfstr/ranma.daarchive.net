</div><p>Akane was not the best student at Furinkan High School. She was downright mediocre, to put it bluntly. Poor attendance, poor assessments and poor attitude all haunted her permanent record. Still, she tried. Her mother had always stressed the importance of academics and Akane wanted to live up to her example. But class was just so boring! And what she was being taught just seemed so unimportant. She, Akane, was the heir to the Tendo School of Indiscriminant Grappling. She needed to know two things, at maximum: kicking ass and taking names. After she had learned how to spell in the third grade, it seemed to Akane that she had the latter covered. Moreover, for the past few years, she had a growing suspicion that school was actually detracting from the former. But here she was, in class, struggling vainly to stay awake. If truth be told, that was all that could be asked of a person, right? That was really Akane's last coherent thought as her head drifted slowly, almost gracefully down onto her notebook. It was the final cruelty that the one bit of useful information she had written down during class was obliterated by drool.</p><p>Bill presents:</p><p>Ranma ½, A Man's Woman</p><p>Part Six: Oh Captain! My Captain!</p><p>"Akane, wake up!"</p><p>"Huh?" Akane responded coherently and sat up. Her notebook stuck tenaciously to her cheek and she scrambled hastily to remove it.</p><p>"Class is over. Didn't ya hear the bell ring?" Ranma was crouched on top of the next desk over from Akane's. The rest of the room was empty.</p><p>"Ugh. How long have I been asleep?" Akane was still a bit hazy as she tried to rub the drool off of her face. Still, she was glad that Ranma was talking to her. He had given her the cold shoulder before class, even going so far as to sit on the opposite side of the room.</p><p>"Since the middle of the Meji period. At least I think that's what we learned about in history." Ranma's expression was unreadable.</p><p>"Great, just what I needed. Let's grab our lunches and eat outside. At least the weather's still nice."</p><p>"You go ahead. I didn't bring mine." Ranma mumbled as they both walked out of the classroom. The halls were nearly deserted as most of the students had tried to cram in as much of the fine weather as they could.</p><p>"Oh, yeah." Akane said softly, thinking about the reason Ranma must have forgotten his bag. She was still at a loss over how to talk to Ranma about this morning. But she wanted to try. "You can share mine. I packed way too much."</p><p>"Sure, thanks." Ranma said, not looking at Akane.</p><p>As they had suspected, the weather outside was gorgeous. It was a little too hot, but a light breeze kept them both comfortable. Together they choose a spot on the athletic fields. Clouds drifted aimlessly overhead, creating patches of light and shade on the rich green grass. Other students dotted the slopped turf that lead down to the level playing area. In the center, members of the Judo club were arguing with the Boxing club about Nabiki's absence. Each side suspected the other of foul play and the whole mess eventually devolved into a congenial brawl. Akane set her lunch down between the herself and Ranma. It was one of her mother's specialties from America: peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on soft white bread. Of course, her mother had a lot of specialties like that. Ranma seemed to relax a little bit as they ate and he started up a running commentary on the poor techniques both sides were using. Akane sighed. The afternoon was almost too nice to spoil. Still, there was no way to avoid it.</p><p>Akane pushed herself up to standing and promptly bowed towards Ranma. "I want to offer my formal apologies on behalf of the Tendo School of Indiscriminant grappling. You and your father were wronged today and I am sorry. If you wish to punish me or call for a duel of honor…"</p><p>"Aw, come on. That ain't necessary." Ranma said, his face turning red as he cut off Akane's speech.</p><p>Akane remained standing. "It most certainly is necessary. When we return home, I will offer the same to your father."</p><p>"Geeze, Akane. Would you sit down? First of all, Pops ain't going to be there when we get home."</p><p>"Why not?" Akane asked, reluctantly taking her seat again.</p><p>"He usually clears out when things go bad like this. He'll just hang around for a while and come back when he feels ready." Ranma noticed one of the boxers throw a particularly sloppy uppercut, but he didn't feel inclined to comment on it.</p><p>"But he shouldn't have to. It's not right." Akane said firmly.</p><p>"Your dad did beat him fair and square." Ranma's eyes grew angry as he thought back to the fight this morning. To Akane, his face seemed to coil itself into a scowl.</p><p>"But your dad was tricked, Ranma."</p><p>"Look, I ain't saying things were one way or the other. All I know is that we practice Anything Goes and my pops should have realized it." Ranma's voice sounded bitter, as if he was trying to rationalize things to himself. "I don't know how things are for you, but Anything Goes is more like a way we live than just a way we fight. I think maybe your dad lives that way too."</p><p>Akane looked straight at Ranma. He had his hands clasped between his knees and his knuckles were white. "What are you going to do, Ranma?"</p><p>"What can I do? I've gotta honor the promise my pops made. But don't think that means that I'm gonna roll over for the next year. I know it sounds crazy, but I need to figure out a way to beat your dad."</p><p>Akane's lip twisted into a sly smile and she caught Ranma's eye. "That's funny. I was thinking the exact same thing."</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma said, turning to face Akane. His expression was no longer so sour. "What did you have in mind?"</p><p>"Well, for starters, I think we could use another sparring session. Want to help me clear some morons off the field?"</p><p>As Ranma gazed out at the field, some of the anger seemed to run out of him. Akane felt her heart skip a beat as Ranma smiled for the first time that day.</p><p>Akane hummed to herself as she and Ranma walked home along the canal fence. The second half of the day had been much more enjoyable than the first part. After their 'workout', Ranma had seemed to cheer up a bit. They had passed notes back and forth during class, trying to dissect the techniques they had seen both of their father's use. Of course, they had been caught towards the end of the day, but the teacher had been too tired to punish them with anything more severe than a lecture. Though Ranma's mood had seemed to improve, Akane was still worried about what would happen when they got home.</p><p>Almost as if in answer to Akane's thoughts, the walls of the Tendo household appeared around the corner. Several mothers were milling in and around the gate. As Akane and Ranma got closer, a stream of children came running out. All of the children were dressed in white gi's with a multitude of different belts among them. Akane saw several of the children she taught on the weekends and she waved to them. Akane still wasn't sure how she felt about the formal levels of training. Anything Goes didn't really have a process of ranking. It didn't even have a recognized procedure for licensing instructors. At its most basic, Anything Goes had a fairly simple philosophy; the person who won the fight was the instructor. Still, when her mother had suggested the idea of belts, her father had gone along with it, at least for the children's classes. In the months that followed, Akane had noticed several times that the kids seemed to work harder for a reward in her classes. It also seemed to make the classes more popular and that never hurt the dojo's bottom line.</p><p>Akane weaved her way between the horde of mothers and children, saying a quick hello here and there. "Hey Ranma, let's head into the dojo. It should be clear until the evening classes start."</p><p>"See ya in there." Ranma answered as he vaulted over the wall, neatly avoiding the traffic jam Akane was stuck in.</p><p>"Show off." Akane muttered good naturedly.</p><p>Inside the dojo, Soun Tendo was showing one of his more dedicated young students the finer points of the Spear Hand strike. "The key is to keep the fingers curved but ridged. The striking surface, the fingers, the hand and the wrist are all one. Maintain suppleness in the elbow and the shoulder."</p><p>Soun looked up as Ranma entered the dojo. Soun's expression didn't change, but he finished up with the student quickly, ushering the boy out of the door to his waiting mother.</p><p>Ranma stood near the doorway and glared at Soun. His body tightened into readiness. He didn't intend to start a fight, but he felt anger welling up inside himself, coiling in his stomach like a hissing snake. Soun, to his credit, did not seem to respond, but Ranma knew that the older man could be set at a moments notice.</p><p>As Akane walked into the dojo, she could sense the anger between her father and Ranma. Akane chose consciously to walk between the two on her way to the dressing room, breaking their eye contact. She hoped that she could diffuse the tension somehow. "Ranma, you can wash up in the men's locker room before we get started."</p><p>It seemed to Akane that minutes passed before Ranma stopped glowering and nodded his head. As Akane lead Ranma towards the back of the dojo, she noticed that his muscles were still tight with readiness.</p><p>Once inside the women's changing area, Akane inhaled deeply and tried to relax. The cedar lockers and benches that her father had installed years ago were aging beautifully. The smell of sweat and spicy wood always reminded Akane of the more infamous training sessions she had undergone. Akane opened her personal locker and took out her training gi. As she dressed, she glanced at the photo of herself she had pinned on the door. It showed her as a young girl, holding a championship trophy from her first tournament. Below that was the letter she had received from China. The yellow paper and archaic script non-withstanding, the message it contained always put her in the mood for training. As she cinched her grandfather's belt around her waist, an idea took root in her mind. Akane made a mental note to ask her father about it later.</p><p>Back in the dojo, Akane found Ranma was already there. He was warming up in the center of the dojo. Her father was nowhere to be seen. Akane stopped and watched Ranma as he moved around the floor. He was weaving his limbs around in graceful arcs and carefully stepping around an imaginary circle. Akane was familiar with Ba Gua, but Ranma seemed to have put his own personal spin on it. Akane found herself mesmerized by Ranma's soft, gentle movements. It was really too bad that she was going to have to pound his face in when they sparred next.</p><p>Soun Tendo entered the dojo with a bundle in his arms. He set it down off to the side and straightened up. "Both of you, come over here."</p><p>Ranma finished up his form and joined Akane, who gone to kneel in front of her father. Ranma choose to remain standing.</p><p>"Let me make this clear: you are both here to be trained. As you know, I believe that I can make you into the best fighters you can be. I expect you to be here every day, working hard and pushing yourselves. I expect no less than complete dedication."</p><p>"Sure, whatever." Ranma said, turning away from Soun.</p><p>"Ranma, I am not done talking." Soun's voice had a razor's edge to it.</p><p>"Yeah? Well, I'm done listening. Let's spar." Ranma dropped back into a fighting stance.</p><p>"If you insist." Soun said, bending over to his bundle and retrieving a thermos. "Just one thing first."</p><p>Ranma had too much experience with water to be taken off guard; he dodged back as Soun unleashed the contents of the thermos, but his target was not Ranma. Akane shrieked from the cold and surprise as the water struck her full in the face.</p><p>"What the hell, Daddy?" Akane yelled, springing to her feet.</p><p>Akane stopped. Her voice sounded odd, deeper and more resonant that before. Her body seemed different, too. Her gi was too short and too tight. She threw open the lapels of her top, looked down at her empty sports bra and screamed.</p><p>Ranma stood paralyzed for a moment. He had watched the change a hundred or more times as his father had gone from Panda to man. Still, it was much more unsettling to see Akane's body shift and rearrange itself. The change was fast, but he could see her hips slim and her shoulders broaden. Her jaw squared itself and her ponytail shortened into a crew cut. Ranma would think back later that night and wonder why, as he attacked Soun in anger, he didn't give a single thought to a cure for himself.</p><p>Soun's iron grip caught Ranma's fist and twisted it into a pain hold. The softness of Soun's voice belied his almost superhuman strength as he bent Ranma nearly in half. "It's just temporary."</p><p>"Let go of me!" Ranma shouted, his voice strained from the pain he was feeling.</p><p>Akane stepped forward and confronted her father. Despite her shock, she took some satisfaction in towering over both men in her new form. "What do you mean, 'temporary'?"</p><p>Soun tried to sound patient. "It was a packet of Instant Nannīchuan, Spring of Drowned Man. It isn't permanent. Any hot water and you'll turn right back."</p><p>"But…" Akane's eyes betrayed her confusion and anger. "Why?"</p><p>"The evening Ranma arrived, I consulted some friends in China about possible solutions to the curse. One of them suggested these and shipped them express to me. I tried them out and, even though they aren't a cure, I thought they would make a good training exercise for today."</p><p>"Daddy, that's crazy!" Akane shouted. She found that her male voice carried quite a bit further than her normal tone.</p><p>"Not a bit. We are always working on balance. Having to deal with a different center of gravity will do you a world of good. Dealing with different strength, different limb length and weight will all help you become more adaptable. Plus, I will be using those to spice things up." Soun's eyes flicked over to the remainder of his bundle. Inside the cloth were two squirt guns, one red and one blue.</p><p>"Let me guess, one is hot water and the other is cold." Akane said, crossing her arms and placing her weight on one hip. It was a decidedly unmanly bearing.</p><p>"Exactly. First one to change is out. Now then, when you are both ready: attack me!"</p><p>"Daddy, you have to let go of him first." Akane said impatiently, pointing down at a whimpering Ranma.</p><p>Akane signed and stretched a bit deeper in a yoga pose. It felt good to be back in her normal body after the workout. She had been unsteady in her new form at first, but there were certain advantages that she had found. Longer reach and greater strength compensated for a general slow-down. It had taken her a while to find her sea legs, so to speak. As she and Ranma had attacked her father, her confidence had grown. The teamwork, as well, had been a little shaky at the outset. At first Ranma had seemed intent on attacking directly, probably due to his lingering anger. As it had become clear that Akane's father was too good, though, Ranma had backed off to re-evaluate. Akane had formulated a series of plans to distract her father, and they had nearly been effective, but he had proven as adept with squirt guns as with his bare fists. Still, the spray attacks had pushed Ranma and Akane to invent new and interesting ways to deal with water. In a split second block, Ranma had used a loose floor board to deflect an incoming squirt. Near the end of the fight, Akane spun herself so quickly as to create a mini-whirlwind and channel the water away. It had almost worked, and probably would with a little practice. Thinking about it, Akane supposed that the trial and error had probably been part of her father's plan. Put a student in a situation and force them to invent a way out of it: classic Tendo Anything Goes.</p><p>Akane pushed herself up and considered beginning another yoga form. Ranma had left a while earlier, claiming that he needed to soak in the furo for at least 6 months after the workout. Akane smiled, thinking of how he had grabbed a packet of instant Nannīchuan before he left. From there Akane's thoughts turned to her father. She was forced to admit that her father had some clever ideas. The transformation that she herself had undergone had shocked Ranma out of his anger about his father. Even the packets of Instant Nannīchuan themselves suggested that Soun had not given up on helping Ranma. Akane still wasn't sure how she felt about her father's behavior, but she was just a bit more willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Speaking of the devil, Akane watched as Soun entered the dojo and began setting up for the evening classes. Even though Ranma was gone, Soun looked about hesitantly, as if he wanted to avoid any more conflict that day.</p><p>Fat chance, Akane thought to herself. "Daddy, I want to talk to you."</p><p>"Of course." Soun said wearily. He set down the Shinai he was planning to use later. He steeled himself for another argument and, knowing his youngest daughter, probably another sparring session.</p><p>"Why did you beat up poor Mr. Saotome?"</p><p>Soun looked taken aback for a moment. "Beat him up? I did no such thing. We fought a duel of honor."</p><p>"Oh, Daddy, don't lie to me."</p><p>"Do not accuse me of lying, Akane." Soun's voice was soft but suddenly dangerous. "You were a witness to the agreement and to the fight. You know exactly what happened."</p><p>"But that fight wasn't fair. You tricked Mr. Saotome into agreeing with you and then you hurt him. Daddy, you hurt him so badly." Akane found herself becoming more and more emotional.</p><p>"I had to do it Akane." Soun paused and took a step towards his daughter, willing her to understand. "It was for Ranma's sake."</p><p>"Mr. Satome nearly died!" Akane cried, bursting into tears.</p><p>Soun went to his daughter then and wrapped his arms around her. Akane tried to push him off at first, but eventually she gave in and sobbed into her father's chest like a child. Soun whispered into Akane's hair. "Sometimes, my little fighter, we have to harden ourselves to make things better."</p><p>"How was any of this better?" Akane asked through her tears.</p><p>"I did what I did to give Ranma a choice. I know that you don't understand, but you have to believe that I did what was best for him."</p><p>"How can you ask me to just believe you?"</p><p>"Please, daughter. Just give me some time and you will see that I did the right thing for Ranma."</p><p>"And if he doesn't think it's the right thing? Then what?"</p><p>"It is his decision. If he chooses to leave, he is free to go; I won't hold him here by force. In all honesty, I wasn't sure if Ranma had elected to leave with his father this morning until you both came home from school."</p><p>"So Mr. Saotome is really gone? Ranma must feel so awful." Akane gently disentangled herself from her father and wiped her eyes on her sleeve.</p><p>"Genma will be back. Of that, I have no doubt."</p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p>"For right now, I think we will do as we always do: train and live our lives. I would like to ask you for one thing, though, daughter."</p><p>"What?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Be Ranma's friend. He needs one now, more than ever."</p><p>Akane's expression darkened slightly. "I'm already his friend Daddy. I wouldn't stop just because you and Mr. Saotome had an argument."</p><p>Soun blew out an exasperated sigh. He felt as if he had been taking more sighs than normal breaths in these past few days. But then he was reminded of something Kimiko's father had told him on their wedding day: daughters were heaven's way of reminding the righteous man not to get too cocky. "Of course. I never should have doubted you."</p><p>As Soun turned to walk back to the house, Akane stopped him. "One more thing Daddy."</p><p>"Yes, daughter?"</p><p>"Can I have the key to the scroll room? Please?"</p><p>Soun was caught off guard by the request and he looked at Akane suspiciously. "For what?"</p><p>"I want one of the Amazon scrolls."</p><p>"Really? Well, I suppose that they are yours. Just remember that you are not to touch anything else. Is that clear?" Soun reached between the lapels of his gi and fished out a thin iron chain. From off of the chain he removed an oddly shaped key and handed it over to Akane.</p><p>"Oh, thanks Daddy. I'll have it back to you by dinner time."</p><p>Soun watched his daughter run out of the back of the dojo and he wondered what new challenge the next day would bring.</p><p>Akane walked down the stairs in the back of the dojo. It was dusty, but as always, there were no cobwebs. Spiders, Akane had noticed, tended to avoid this place. Akane shivered and thought she understood why. As she got closer and closer to the bottom, she felt increasingly uncomfortable. There was a chill setting into her bones that she knew from experience wouldn't go away for hours after she left. Akane had asked her father about it once, but he had only nodded and said that he felt the same way.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, a small hallway led to a metal door. If Akane had known more about metallurgy, she would have recognized that the door was not steel, but in fact cold wrought iron. The door itself was carved with runes and symbols. Some of the words were in Japanese and Akane recognized them, but others were in languages that she couldn't even begin to recognize. In the center of the door a leering demon face stuck out, taunting everyone who came down here. Akane grabbed the key from around her wrist. The teeth of the iron key were sharper than a normal key, almost like needles, and the sides had small runes carved into them. Akane took a breath to steel herself. She plunged her hand into the demon's mouth and felt around for the lock. The key seemed to resist for a moment, but she rammed it home and it turned with a hallow click.</p><p>Inside the door was even colder than before and Akane could see her breath. The passageway from the door was nearly pitch black, as if the florescent light from the hallway was afraid to venture inside. She carefully stepped over the line of salt on the floor and went over to the alcove just inside the doorway. Akane struck a match and lit one of the small oil lamps that she found there. She noticed that several of the lamps were low on oil and she made a mental note to remind her father.</p><p>Walking deeper into the scroll room, Akane's lamp flickered and cast dizzying shadows on the walls. The room itself had high ceilings and was almost as large as the dojo above. The scrolls were all to be found in cabinets at the periphery. Off to one side was a large cedar door. Akane knew that inside was her father's private collection of scrolls, but she had never been allowed to go in and see them. A red rope and a Shinto ward hung over the doorway. Akane kept well away, skirting the place on the floor where a line of runes ran in a semi-circle in front of the door. Even after years of coming down to the scroll room, Akane still wondered about the wards and the general creepiness of the place. Akane knew that her father was a little off when it came to Martial Arts techniques, but even so, all of this seemed a bit excessive. When Kasumi had first asked about it when they were all young, her father had launched into a cryptic lecture about the nature and purpose of the Tendo School of Indiscriminant Grappling. Every question generally met with the same long-winded and uninformative answers. Eventually, the sisters had stopped asking. But it didn't mean that Akane wasn't still curious.</p><p>Akane found her own private scroll cabinet and slid open the drawers. Inside were copies of the techniques she had mastered and even some that she had invented herself. Akane carefully moved these to the side and took out an innately gilded case. Opening the lid revealed several scrolls, all with labels in Chinese. Akane shuffled through the contents until she found the scroll she had been thinking of earlier in the day.</p><p>Kachū Tenshin Amaguriken.</p><p>Ranma was in for a surprise, Akane thought wickedly as she removed the scroll.</p><p>Author's notes:</p><p>Ok, so I was going to try to make this chapter a little less angsty and a little more fun. That didn't happen. In my mind, the essence of drama is tension, so I've found that I can't really steer away from big emotions. But I also like the comedy and silliness of the original comic, so I will definitely keep trying to include that. There is more to come on the scroll room and also on secret Amazon techniques. Plus, maybe another R+A fight!</p><p>Always remember to take it easy!</p><p>Oh, and C+C always welcome. The more the better, I always say!</p>
