</div><p>Somewhere among the forests of Hokkido, a flock of birds startled and took flight. As they wheeled and soared into the sky, they screeched down at the boy who had disturbed their rest. Ryoga, the boy in question, couldn't be bothered with noticing all the avian rage that was being directed his way; he was too busy cursing his luck yet again. Damn Ranma! They had stepped out of the school yard to fight and suddenly Ryoga had found himself on a sandy beach. That was how it happened every time; he took his eyes off of his goal for one second and the world simply reorganized itself. Someone must have tricked him. No, not someone: Ranma. I shall have my revenge! Ryoga let himself indulge in daydreams of revenge for another few minutes, but then reluctantly pulled himself out of his fantasy world. He was getting nowhere fast. He looked up and tried to think where in the world he might be. Let's see, he was on the beach and now in the forest. Ryoga bent down and picked up a walnut that had fallen from a nearby tree. He must be in the heart of Tokyo! From there, though, Ryoga's thoughts invariably strayed from localities and geography, turning back to his hated enemy, Ranma. You did this to my life! You made it a disaster! Just like this walnut, so shall I crush your throat! Your time has come, Ranma! Cry Ranma, cry!</p><p>Bill presents:</p><p>Ranma ½, A Man's Woman</p><p>Part Nine: The China Syndrome</p><p>"Mrs. Tendo!"</p><p>Kimiko poked her head into the dojo from the yard. She was dressed plainly in blue overalls and her hair was kept beneath a red bandana. "Yes, Ranma?"</p><p>"Uh, can you take a look at this?" Ranma held out his hand. The weekend had come again and Ranma had time to devote to training. He was seated in the center of the dojo holding his hand up in front of his face.</p><p>Kimko pulled off the leather work gloves she was wearing and removed her shoes. She had been helping Ranma train in the Apian Fist and thus far his progress had been remarkable. Kimiko felt proud of Ranma and of herself, so she was anxious to see what he had done. Kimiko wanted to have everything perfect for Soun's return, but clearing the yard would have to wait. "Is there something wrong?"</p><p>Ranma flexed his hand and slowly, ever so gently, five razor sharp chi blades slid out of his fingers. As Kimiko walked into the dojo, she looked down at Ranma and saw his hand lit up with blue chi. She was immensely impressed that Ranma had been able to generate the stingers of the Apian Fist in such a short period of time. With her reticence, Akane had barely been able to generate one stinger with months of training. As Kimiko continued to look down at Ranma's hand, though, she noticed something was off.</p><p>"Why are your chi stingers curved?" Kimiko asked, squatting down close to where Ranma was sitting.</p><p>"I dunno. That's what I want to ask you about." Ranma flexed his hand and the blades slid in and out of his fingers on command.</p><p>Kimiko reached over and gently took Ranma's wrist in her hand. "That's cute. They're like little cat's claws."</p><p>Almost reflexively, Ranma snatched his hand back and the blades vanished. He cradled his wrist in his other hand like it was broken. When he finally spoke, his voice was soft with fear. "Do you think it's ok?"</p><p>Kimiko looked at Ranma. It was difficult to tell what he was thinking with the sunglasses on, but she was reasonably certain that this was another one of Ranma's secrets. The boy seemed to have so many! Kimko gave her best motherly smile and tried to reassure Ranma. "Well, they still looked sharp enough. I guess you'll just have to angle your strikes."</p><p>"Angle my strikes?" Ranma asked, letting his hands fall to his lap.</p><p>"When you use the Apian Fist." Kimiko dusted her knees off and lowered herself down onto the floor in front of Ranma. "You're progressing so fast. We really should discuss the next phase of your training. Why don't you tell me what you've learned already and we'll go from there."</p><p>"Well, for starters I've been wearing these glasses for a week now and I think I get the point of them. They help me see chi, right?"</p><p>"Very good, Ranma. They are actually designed block everything but chi. The lenses are made from thin pieces of red jade. You have to learn how to see the flow of energy in the world around you if you are going to be able to see anything at all. To be accurate, you are not really seeing the chi with your eyes, only sensing it, but it is a good metaphor. Go ahead, close your eyes and look at me."</p><p>Kimiko waited a few seconds as Ranma furrowed his brow and stared intently at her. "Hey. I can see you!"</p><p>"Perfect! As you have gotten better and better, the chi has resolved itself into meridians and acupuncture points, correct?"</p><p>Ranma fingered the glasses that were perched on his nose and opened his eyes back up. "Yeah, at first everyone was just sort of glowy, but now people look kinda like acupuncture dummies or something."</p><p>"Excellent. This part is called the Scent. You can sense the chi points and go right to them, like a bee to a flower. More importantly, you can see how the different meridians change into the transformations of yin and yang, not to mention the colors of the five elements. It is really quite clever, if I do say so myself. Moreover, we already know that you can make a credible Stinger, or should I say Stingers. What else do you think you need?"</p><p>Ranma took off his glasses and ran his hand through his hair. Mrs. Tendo was pushing him to consider the technique on his own; a difficult thing for any student to do, but it still didn't really feel like training. She was just too nice, too relaxed. "Um, I need to know what I'm doing?"</p><p>"Ha, well said!" Kimiko patted Ranma on the knee. "The last part of the Apian Fist, the Dance!"</p><p>Kimiko got to her feet and reached down to pull Ranma up with her. She noticed as she tugged on his hand that Ranma was actually quite heavy. Still a boy, to be sure, but beginning to get his man's growth started. He also still dressed a bit like a youngster, a youngster in Chinese clothing she amended, but Kimiko could see the places where his muscles would fill those clothes out in a few years: wider shoulders, broader chest. He would probably be quite a catch by the time he finished high school. Kimiko smiled to herself. She would let Akane worry about all that.</p><p>"The first two parts of the Apian fist are like a preparation for the third. Tell me, Ranma, how many acupuncture points are there?"</p><p>"Um, 108, right?"</p><p>"Correct and incorrect at the same time." Kimiko said, holding up her index finger and letting her own blue chi stinger extend slowly.</p><p>"Huh? How can it be both?" Ranma managed.</p><p>"There are normally 108 points available to the acupuncture needle. But our bodies have so many others, hundreds more, below the surface. When I heal people with traditional medicine, I use other techniques like moxibution or herbs to bring these other points to the surface. Then the steel needles can find them. The Scent and the Stinger obviate those other modalities. I can see the points beneath your skin and…" Kimiko reached out with her chi needle and punctured Ranma's abdomen. "I can reach them."</p><p>"What did ya do that for?" Ranma said as he staggered backwards away from the needle and then stopped. "That, ah…that felt nice. What did you do?"</p><p>"That was just your Dragon's Deep point. It will simply help your digestion, nothing special."</p><p>"So how do I know which point is which?"</p><p>"That is the Dance! It is really a misnomer, but it fits so well with the other two names. Though, I suppose that bees do dance to show each other how to get to the flowers, so I guess it does have some truth to it…" Kimiko began to ramble on about the lifestyle and pollen collection behavior of bees.</p><p>"Mrs. Tendo?" Ranma said tentatively, interrupting Kimiko's lecture. "What is the dance that I have to learn?"</p><p>"Oh, yes, of course. There's really no dance. I will teach you all the points and their corresponding effects. Come to my study tonight and I will lend you a few books to get started with."</p><p>"Great, thanks." Ranma said, smiling at Mrs. Tendo. "Wait, one more thing: how come I can see things that aren't alive with the glasses? Houses and tables and stuff?"</p><p>"Very astute, Ranma. You have heard of Fung Shui, yes? You do not actually perceive those objects, but rather the way that chi bends around them, like an outline. Do you understand?"</p><p>Ranma's eyes grew serious as he mulled this latest piece of information over. Kimiko walked back over to the dojo door where she had left her gloves and her shoes. As she was slipping her shoes on, she looked back at Ranma. "Oh, Ranma, can you go get Akane and tell her to help me weed the front yard? I want to eat outside when Mr. Tendo gets back this evening."</p><p>"Sure thing, Mrs. Tendo!"</p><p>Ranma could feel the heat coming before he rounded the back corner of the dojo. Even so, he was taken aback by what he saw. Stretched out across the yard was a pit of red hot burning coals. The air above them was shimmering from the heat. Ranma threw up his arm over his face and walked forward. He saw Akane off to one side, standing just on the edge of the coals. She was dressed in her white training gi with the legs rolled up, like she was about to wade through a pool of water. Akane was focused on the coals and she appeared not to see Ranma through the fire. Just as he was about to reach her, she grabbed a bucket of water and emptied it over her own head, soaking her hair and clothes. Then, before Ranma could stop her, she ran forward into the blaze. Ranma wanted to shout at Akane to stop, but the words caught in his throat. She would be killed! He got to the edge of the pit and stopped. He couldn't help staring in open admiration. Akane was a blur, running quickly through the flames. Every now and then, she would kick one of her feet and a small object would go sailing out onto the grass. Ranma rubbed his eyes from the heat and looked again. Akane wasn't just running, she was doing forms! Seeing that Akane was in no immediate danger, Ranma skirted the edge of the pit over to one of the things Akane had kicked out. He reached down and yelped, withdrawing his hand. It was a roasted chestnut!</p><p>In another few seconds, Akane ran out of the flames next to Ranma. "Hey, I didn't see you."</p><p>"Yeah, I just came to get you for your mother. What's all this?" Ranma gestured to the fire pit.</p><p>"Training. Here, let's get out of the heat." Akane stepped over a few of the chestnuts and pointed around the corner.</p><p>Ranma walked back the way he had come and squatted down next to the rain barrel the Tendos had set up beside the dojo. "Is that how you got so fast?"</p><p>"Yeah, basically. But the pit is new: an Akane original." Akane beamed as she took a drink of water from the barrel. Her entire face and most of her body was raw pink from the fire. The heat had burned away most of the water that had soaked her gi and her hair. Even so, Ranma could actually see a few places where she was singed. Overall, though, Akane looked exceptionally proud of herself. "It's been really hard, but I think I'm getting the hang of it."</p><p>"You know what they say: if you can't stand the heat…" Ranma said jokingly.</p><p>"Oh, that's not funny." Akane said, flicking a little bit of water at Ranma.</p><p>"Don't do that, ya tomboy!" Ranma yelped.</p><p>"Don't call me a tomboy. You'll pay for that!" Akane said with mock seriousness, cupping her hands and sending a wave of water crashing out of the barrel.</p><p>Ranma twisted fluidly, moving out of the way. "Alright, alright! I give. It was a bad joke."</p><p>"Yeah, it was." Akane laughed and stepped away from the water. They both stood grinning at each other and Akane felt a small flutter in her chest, the same kind she had felt a few weeks before when Ranma had smiled at her. With all that had happened, she still had to admit that he was cute, in a rough and tumble sort of way. "Hey, how did things go with Ryoga?"</p><p>"Oh man, that guy." Ranma laughed again and put a hand behind his head. "We stepped out of the school yard to fight and bam, he was gone."</p><p>"Gone?" Akane asked, laughing along with Ranma.</p><p>"Yeah, he has a terrible sense of direction. He got himself lost again. It was like 20 feet."</p><p>"Poor guy. Still, what are you going to do about the fight?"</p><p>"What can I do? I'll just wait till he shows up and we'll have it out."</p><p>"I mean, are you going to train?" Akane asked.</p><p>"How? My rib's pretty busted up right now." Ranma looked at Akane. She flinched when he mentioned his ribs and even now looked a little guilty. Ranma thought he would feel glad at Akane's embarrassment but somehow her downcast expression just made him feel uncomfortable, like he was the one who had done something wrong. "I'll just keep doing what I'm doing."</p><p>Akane was still feeling remorseful, so she offered an olive branch. "I could teach you the Kachū Tenshin Amaguriken. It's just moving really fast. It shouldn't tax your body too badly."</p><p>"Is that ok? Your dad won't get mad that you're sharing secret techniques?"</p><p>"The Amaguriken isn't a Tendo technique, so how can he say no? I got it when I became an Amazon in China."</p><p>Even though Mrs. Tendo had already informed Ranma about the origin of the technique, he was still shocked. His mouth fell open and he took an involuntary step back, raising his hands as if to ward off Akane. "What? You're an Amazon?"</p><p>Akane, for her part, was entirely confused by Ranma's reaction. "Yeah. Honorary anyway. Is there something wrong with that?"</p><p>"Uh, no, no, no." Ranma stuttered, trying to hide his worry. "Like, um, how did that happen?"</p><p>Akane didn't answer right away, instead she studied Ranma's face as he pretended to look innocent. If Akane were honest with herself, she would probably admit that she was not the keenest student of human nature, but on the other hand Ranma was probably the worst liar Akane had ever met. She knew immediately that he was hiding something about the Amazons, but Akane had learned a little something about Ranma over the past few weeks. He never volunteered information about himself. Akane decided that she was probably going to have to tell him the entire China story before he would open up even a little. If that was the case, Akane resigned herself, she would rather play raconteur on the porch, preferably sitting down and sipping something cool. Motioning Ranma along, Akane lead him into the house. After a brief stopover in the kitchen, they settled themselves down overlooking the koi pond.</p><p>Akane took a long drink of her lemonade. "It was about two years ago, right before summer vacation. Mom had gotten word of some amazing acupuncture practices from China. These were high level techniques: memory manipulation, sensory treatments and things like that. She wanted to go check it out, but she found out from some old friends in Beijing that all this stuff was being done by a super serious tribe of warrior women, the Amazons, ok? From what we could gather, the Amazons didn't take very kindly to men of any sort, so Dad was out. I figured that anybody with that much knowledge about acupuncture had to know some martial arts, so I decided to tag along with Mom. Dad and I swam across from Nagasaki to Shanghai and Mom met us there. Dad left to go get some scroll or another while Mom and I made our way into the mountains…</p><p>Akane pushed aside a low hanging branch and stepped up onto the summit of the mountain pass. Below her, she could now see the entire valley stretching out between the slopes of the adjacent cliffs. A thick carpet of jungle covered the valley floor, lush and green; a wilderness that looked like it had been untouched for thousands of years. Winding its way through the trees was a ribbon of blue and silver. At the last village the guide had told them to follow the river, but refused to come any further. He was afraid of what the Amazons might to do him and he had told them as much. Thus far Akane and her mother had dogged the river's path with no results. Akane was not feeling worn out, but Kimiko was no warrior and she had begun to tire after a week of rough traveling. Akane blew out a pent up breath and readjusted the packs on her back. She had begun carrying both loads a few days ago, just to give her mother a break.</p><p>Kimiko came puffing up the trail a few minutes later. She had taken off her denim shirt and her white undershirt was soaked with sweat. She pulled the red bandanna from around her neck and tried vainly to wipe some sweat from her face. Kimiko finally caught her breath and patted Akane on the shoulder she pulled even. "Any sign of the village?"</p><p>Akane took out a flask of water and after taking a long drink offered it to her mother. "No, not yet."</p><p>A small sound in the jungle behind Akane caused her to whirl around. Much to her shock, she found a tall, beautiful Chinese woman pointing spear at her. The woman was dressed in flowing multicolored silks, but her torso and hips were covered in black lacquered armor. The woman's shiny green hair was caught up into two buns on either side of her head by golden bangles. Akane marveled that the women had been able to sneak up on them at all. She growled something in Chinese.</p><p>Kimiko turned at the sound of the woman's voice and yelped. "She says to lay down our weapons."</p><p>"What weapons, mom? We're unarmed."</p><p>"I'll tell her." A rapid fire exchange of Chinese followed between Kimiko and the spear-wielder.</p><p>As the discussion dragged on, Akane became impatient with the steel spear tip that was pointed at her throat. "Mom, tell her to put her spear down or I'm gonna take it away."</p><p>Kimiko stopped speaking in Chinese. "Akane, no! If you fight with her, she'll try to kill you. These Amazons mean business. Even if we win, she says she'll hunt us down and kill us. My colleagues in Beijing called it the Kiss of Death. Just put up your hands and stay still. I think I can talk us out of this."</p><p>A few minutes later, Akane found herself with hands tied, being marched through the jungle at spear point. She was connected to her mother, who walked up ahead, similarly bound by a short rope. "Awesome Mom. We're doing just great."</p><p>"Just be patient dear."</p><p>The Amazon warrior, whose name turned out to be Soap, directed the two Tendo women through a secret path down out of the mountain pass and into the jungle. It was clear that the Amazons guarded their boarder jealously and the path they took reflected that. There were double switchbacks, traps, pits and more armed guards hidden throughout the trail. In some ways, Akane and Kimiko considered themselves lucky; they never would have made it through this stretch of jungle alive without Soap to direct them.</p><p>As they rounded the final turn, the jungle broke and the village opened up before them. Akane turned back to look and found that she could not see the mountain pass. The village was cleverly hidden so that travelers might pass it right by. As long as they weren't accosted by spear women, Akane amended. A nudge from Soap moved Akane along. The village itself was rather large and it bustled with activity. Akane could see women haggling in the streets, women shoeing horses, and an abnormally large number of women standing outside of a local bar, drinking. The men, for the most part, herded screaming children around the muddy streets and tried to keep out of the way of the fiercer looking women. The buildings themselves were clay and brick, but the construction was impeccable. Most of the structures looked like they had been freshly painted in bright colors and there were flags and banners flying all over. There was an air of celebration among the people.</p><p>"Where are we going?" Akane asked her mother.</p><p>Kimiko looked back over her shoulder and coughed. The jungle trek had been harder on her mother than Akane had thought. Still, Kimiko managed to choke out a few words. "The elders. We're being taken to see the elders."</p><p>"Let's stop and ask Soap what's going on."</p><p>Kimiko stopped to catch her breath and made some gestures around the village, pointing at the drinking women and the decorations. Soap looked impatient, but she listened to the questions and responded. "Soap says this is the summer festival. There is going to be a big feast tonight."</p><p>A few minutes later Akane and Kimiko arrived at the stone hall that stood at the center of the village. They were led into a large, cool room and they found themselves looking up at several wizened old women who sat on semi-circular riser. The women ranged in size from dwarves to one woman who appeared to be well over two meters tall. The elders, as they were introduced, were uniformly ancient and their dress was richer and more old-fashioned than that of the women outside.</p><p>One of the smaller women hopped forward while perched on her staff. Her balance was impeccable. To Akane and Kimiko's surprise, she spoke in clear Japanese. "Xo Pu, what are you doing? When you were put in charge of the village's safety, you were told to step down defenses. We are no longer taking prisoners."</p><p>Soap stepped forward and answered in Chinese. She stood tall and proud, and more than a little defiant.</p><p>"Speak Japanese for these people. They deserve that much after the way you treated them."</p><p>"Very well, elder Khu Lon." Soap said, also in flawless Japanese. "They violated our borders and they should be punished."</p><p>Soap's words seemed to set off a flurry of conversation among the elders. Several groups started arguing at once and their voices grew louder and louder as the minutes wore on. Finally, Cologne hopped up and down on her staff, banging the tip against the stone riser and silencing discussion. She addressed Akane and Kimiko "I am sorry, you have caught us at a time of transition. You are not our prisoners and you have done nothing wrong. Xo Pu, release them at once."</p><p>Soap drew a knife from her belt and slashed the ropes that bound Kimiko's wrists. Akane simply yanked her hands apart and the ropes tore from the pressure. Akane looked defiantly at Soap and the Amazon warrior made a move towards Akane, but then stopped herself.</p><p>Cologne continued. "Ah, I see some fight in this young one. Very good. What brings you both to our village?"</p><p>Kimiko stepped forward, bushing past Soap. "I have come here for your healing techniques. I have heard tales of them even over in Japan and I am anxious to learn. My daughter, though, seeks martial training."</p><p>"Interesting. Medicine is a good and noble pursuit. We have need of more information. We will trade you some of our secrets for your knowledge of medicine from the outside world, fair? Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for martial arts. We will not trade those secrets away for any price. I am afraid that your daughter had made the trek here in vain."</p><p>Akane looked up angrily at the collection of women. "Just wait a second! I came all this way and you're telling me you won't even spar with me? Just give me a chance!"</p><p>Elder Cologne smiled down at Akane. "Again, such fire! But no, we will not 'just spar' with you. If you battle us, you battle as a warrior."</p><p>"Fine by me!" Akane said, her aura flaring to life.</p><p>Kimiko pulled Akane back and whispered fiercely in her ear. "No, Akane. No way. Remember the Kiss of Death. They'll kill you. Just calm down"</p><p>But Akane was too angry to heed her mother's advice. She shrugged Kimiko off and pointed up at the elders. "This is ridiculous. You must train with each other, right? And you're not all dead, right?"</p><p>"It is true, members of the tribe do spar with one another and there is no bloodshed, but you must realize that…"</p><p>Akane cut Cologne off. "Then just make me a member of the tribe. I'll fight anyone you want."</p><p>Cologne looked down at Akane. Cologne's stare became piercing and even with Akane's anger, she began to wilt under the old woman's gaze. When the elder did speak after an interminable time, her voice was much deeper and more sonorous. Her words carried the weight of a speech practiced a hundred or more times, with the rhythm of a chant and the cadence of a dirge. "A women has come us. What shall we do?"</p><p>The other elders answered as one, mirroring Cologne's deep mantra. "Test her."</p><p>"She craves sisterhood. What shall we do?"</p><p>"Test her."</p><p>"Trial by man and trial by pain. What shall we do?"</p><p>"Test her!"</p><p>That night, as the celebration of the summer festival reached a fever pitch, Akane found herself in a small hut off to one side of the main square. Outside, revelers drank and danced around a giant bonfire. There was raucous singing and drumming to set the tone for the night. Through a small crack in the door, Akane could see the women dressed in incredible finery, carousing in the flickering red light. They appeared to be having the time of their lives. If Akane wasn't about to face unknown advisories in a fight that might go to the death, she may have been tempted to join the fun and enjoy herself. To add to her anxiety, her mother was probably out there somewhere, no doubt worried sick. Akane stepped back from the door and sat down on a chair. It was the only piece of furniture in the room.</p><p>A small knock shook Akane out of her thoughts and an Amazon girl entered the room. She wasn't much older than Akane herself, but the differences between the two girls were marked. The Chinese girl wore a purple dress that hugged her burgeoning curves and then flared at the sleeves into loose, flowing strips of fabric. Every now and then the light from the fire outside would catch golden fibers woven into the fabric and the whole dress would appear glowing and brilliant. The Amazons hair was also a rich, deep purple that matched the dress and her tresses cascaded loose down past her shoulders. The girl looked at Akane nervously, started to speak and then stopped.</p><p>Akane grew impatient with the newcomer. "What?"</p><p>"I, Xian Pu… is here to tells about fightings." The Amazon girl said in broken Japanese.</p><p>Akane sat up in her chair. "Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, please tell me what's going to happen."</p><p>"You must know that weakest Amazon is stronger than all mens. Akane, you is to be fighting mens. All village mens." Xian Pu made a broad, sweeping gesture with her hand.</p><p>Akane looked worried, hoping that she misunderstood. "All of them? At once?"</p><p>"No, is one at a time. But all." Xian Pu nodded her head, emphasizing her point.</p><p>"Ok, I guess. What are the rules?"</p><p>"Is only few rules. Mens is weaker than womens; Akane must not kill or trial is over. If Akane gives up or knocked out, trial is over. " Xian Pu ticked off two fingers and stopped, seemingly satisfied.</p><p>"Fair enough, Shampoo." Akane placed her hands on her knees and pushed herself up to standing. "Let's do it."</p><p>"Is good. But name is not Shampoo." Xian Pu made a face and then repeated her name slowly. "Is Xian Pu."</p><p>"Oh, right. Xian Pu." Akane stopped herself and pronounced the name correctly. Xian Pu smiled reassuringly at Akane.</p><p>Outside, the women had largely settled down and the music was more subdued. Plates of food were being passed around by boys. Most of the women were seated at long wooden tables and they seemed content to gorge themselves in anticipation of the upcoming fight. Xian Pu led Akane through the crowd to a large clear space in front of the bonfire. The elders sat at a table off to one side. Khu Lon, the elder that had spoken before, raised herself up onto her staff and fixed Akane with a steely gaze. The crowd of women fell silent before the matriarch.</p><p>"Akane Tendo! Your trials will begin in a moment. If you fail, if you falter, if you give in, you will be expelled and never allowed to return. But…" Khu Lon held up a wizened finger. "If you succeed, you will be inducted into our sisterhood and the wealth of the tribe shall be yours!"</p><p>The women seated around the bonfire began cheering. Akane looked around at the faces of the Amazons and she was unsure. But as the cheering continued unabated, Akane felt heartened. The women seemed to be rooting for her to succeed. She smiled and waved a hand out at the crowd.</p><p>"Bring out the first man!"</p><p>A young man was lead out in front of the bonfire. He was wearing simple farmer's clothes and his face was covered in dirt. He looked terrified and cringed as the women in the audience made cat calls towards him. Akane almost felt sorry for this poor wretch, but she was wary of any trickery. Dropping into a fighting stance, Akane advanced cautiously on the man. As she got closer, she could see that his eyes were wide with fear and he was even shivering slightly. It was no trick. The man didn't seem aware of Akane until she was almost upon him. When he caught sight of her, he froze, his fists curled up into a mockery of a guard. Still, he gave no active resistance. Slowly, almost gently, Akane reached out her hand and then shoved. The man toppled over and landed hard on his rear end. The women in the crowd jeered and laughed. Xian Pu came forward and held Akane's hand aloft.</p><p>Akane had won. She hoped all the fights would be this easy.</p><p>They were not.</p><p>The latest fight had ended and Akane gasped for breath. She bent down, pushing her hands against her knees to keep herself upright. Two Amazons came forward and dragged the unconscious body of the most recent challenger out of the battle ground. Akane had been fighting for hours and it was well past midnight. The men had gotten progressively better and better, with this last one being yet another incredible warrior. He had been a giant and a master of the meteor hammers. Akane had dodged furiously, exhausted as she was, racing around the bonfire and confusing the man. Finally she found an opening in the man's guard, striking him in the neck and knocking him unconscious.</p><p>Xian Pu bent down next to Akane and offered her drink. As Akane gulped down the water, Xian Pu placed her hand on Akane's back and whispered in her ear. "Next mans is last one. Is Mu Tzu. Strong, but has trouble seeing. He is using hidden weapons. Be careful."</p><p>As Xian Po finished speaking, the last challenge, Mu Tzu, entered the firelight. He was a tall, thin youth. Calling him a man was generous in the extreme, but he carried himself with an air of easy confidence. Mu Tzu's hands, and most of his body, were obscured by the voluminous white pattered robe he wore. Akane decided he must be able to keep an arsenal of hidden weapons beneath his clothes. Mu Tzu pushed his thick glasses up on his nose and regarded Xian Pu. He said something in Chinese that Akane couldn't understand.</p><p>Xian Pu answered back in Japanese. "Stupid Mu Tzu. Mens is not having Amazon honor. Akane will show you that."</p><p>Xian Pu's words enraged Mu Tzu and, as she stepped off to the side, he attacked. As Mu Tzu's hand shot out, a myriad of weapons and chains flew from his sleeve. Akane was caught temporarily off guard, but she was able to flip herself into the air, twisting her body into a tight twirl to avoid the bulk of the attack. Unfortunately, a heavy weight clipped Akane's knee and a blade glanced off of her forearm. She landed in a crouch and inspected the damage. It was a shallow cut, but it still bled. Akane stood and began to move towards Mu Tzu cautiously. Mu Tzu, having gained respect for Akane's style while watching the previous fights, saw that she intended to close with him and sent wave after wave of attacks towards her. Akane, though, was more than prepared as she weaved and ducked between the assaults. Akane kept her movements random, despite the pain in her knee, dancing back and forth, but always moving closer. As Akane drew within striking range, Mu Tzu lashed out with a yell of 'Fist of the White Swan', catching Akane with a glancing blow aside her shoulder. Akane, though, kept her head and pushed through the strike, elbowing Mu Tzu in the chest, clipping his jaw with an uppercut and spinning around for a devastating round kick. Mu Tzu was thrown backwards and a children's potty clattered out of his hands to the ground. Akane, feeling close to the end of her strength, knew that she had one last chance to win the fight. She gave Mu Tzu no quarter as she pursued him, raining down blows as the boy attempted to block. With a final strike, Akane felt something crunch under Mu Tzu's robe. That was the only warning she received before the bombs Mu Tzu carried exploded, throwing them both backwards. Mu Tzu landed in a boneless heap before the elder's table. Akane, however, maintained consciousness and was able to right herself in mid-air, landing mostly erect. She staggered once and held up her fist in victory.</p><p>The Amazons leap to their feet, cheering again. Akane saw her mother push to the front of the crowd and run forwards to congratulate her. As Kimiko reached Akane, she threw her hands around her daughter's neck and hugged her fiercely.</p><p>"Your father will be so proud." Kimiko whispered, her voice ragged with tears.</p><p>"Yeah, I beat 'em." Akane said and sagged against her mother.</p><p>Khu Lon stood up atop her staff and called for silence. It took the Amazons quite some time to settle down, but eventually they returned to their seats and regarded the matriarch.</p><p>"Akane Tendo! You have done well and proven your dominion over men. You have shown that you are fierce, but for the next test, you must also prove that you are a true woman." Khu Lon paused as she raked her eyes across the assembled Amazons. "The pain of childbirth is given to women to establish their superiority over men. To join our sisterhood, you must show that you too can endure pain. Elder Tu Pei Set, the honor is yours."</p><p>One of the other elders arose from the table and stepped into the firelight, approaching Akane. Tu Pei Set had long white hair caught up in a top knot and she had chosen a much more uncomplicated outfit for the celebration than most of the other Amazons. Her silken pants and shirt were simple, but they seemed to stand out in the flames of the bonfire. In Akane's eyes Tu Pei Set was perhaps a bit older than the other matriarchs, but it was so difficult to say. Like the others, she was ancient yet unbent by age. There was something about her face, though, that suggested a timeless wisdom.</p><p>Tu Pei Set came to Akane and laid a hand on her shoulder. Akane noticed in passing that the Amazon elder's hand was cold, even in the heat of the jungle night. "Those not born into the tribe must receive the mark of the Amazons, so that we will know you as a sister. It will hurt child, but that pain will pass. While I work on you, you must be still even though it feels as if your bones will freeze and your marrow boils."</p><p>Akane looked nervously at the elder for a moment, then out into the crowd. After a long moment, Akane nodded her consent. Just as Akane started to leave, she stopped and looked back at her mother. "Can my mother be with me?"</p><p>Tu Pei Set looked appraisingly at Kimiko. "I would not recommend it. This will be a hard thing for any mother to witness. If the tattoo is ruined for any reason, Akane will not be allowed into the tribe. She must have courage."</p><p>"Be brave." Kimiko sobbed and pulled Akane into anther hug, even more tightly than before. "Toothpaste, take care of my daughter."</p><p>Akane groaned with embarrassment and hugged her mother back. "Mother! It's Tu Pei Set, not toothpaste."</p><p>Tu Pei Set stared at the mother and daughter and then gestured for Akane to follow. The rest of the Amazons applauded again as Akane and Tu Pei Set made their way slowly through the crowd. Once they were outside of the ring of firelight, Tu Pei Set walked more quickly and Akane had to trot to keep up. Here, away from the fire, in the darkness, Akane's courage faltered. The village that had looked so festive and bright in the daylight suddenly appeared imposing as the buildings loomed around her. Akane looked at Tu Pei Set's back as the older woman walked. The elder might have just been waiting to get Akane alone. Tu Pei Set had promised pain and Akane had no doubt that she would deliver. Can I endure? Akane wondered to herself. What if Tu Pei Set tries to harm me? But Akane had no answers, only a deep hollow that was settling in her stomach. Akane tried to calm herself, to name the fear that she felt, but all she found were more doubts.</p><p>Just as Akane felt that she was ready to bolt, Tu Pei Set stopped at a small building and unlocked the door. "We are here, child."</p><p>Akane followed Tu Pei Set through the door. The room was low and cramped, filled with various objects that hinted at sinister purposes. The elder disappeared inside the darkened room and Akane blundered after her. A skeleton loomed out of the shadows and Akane jumped to the side, bumping into a row of shelves. As Akane turned, she saw jar after jar filled with eyes, fingers and even more nameless organs. She stifled a scream and put out a hand to steady herself. Under her fingers, she felt metal tools. Looking down, a row of wicked steel instruments gleamed in the moonlight. They were sharp and ready for a torturer's pleasure. A deep and cloying scent hung in the air, no doubt covering a rotted and foul stench. Akane turned to look for the door, determined to fight her way to safety, but she could see nothing in the inky shadows. Still, she would not give in and she crouched down in a tiger stance, ready for the fight of her life.</p><p>A glow flared to life on the far side of the room.</p><p>"What are on earth you doing, child?" Tu Pei Set asked, blowing out the match she had used to light her oil lamp.</p><p>"Oh, um, nothing." Akane said sheepishly. She looked around the newly lighted room and felt extremely embarrassed. The tools and items she had seen were not out of place for an acupuncturist's clinic and the smell was clearly coming from an apothecaries' worth of herb jars that sat along the far wall. All in all, Akane chided herself, it looked very similar to her mother's study, save for the jars of formalin and the distinct lack of a computer. Akane looked again and decided that, no, this room was also much cleaner than her mother's study.</p><p>"Very well, come here and lay down." Tu Pei Set gestured to the massage table she was standing in front of.</p><p>"Ok. Can I get the tattoo on my shoulder?" Akane said, rolling up her sleeve.</p><p>Tu Pei Set smiled and shook her head. "No, child. This requires a little more room than a shoulder. Please take off your shirt."</p><p>Akane felt her cheeks burning red again, but she was too embarrassed to say no. She pulled her t-shirt up over her head and flung herself face down on the empty table. She found herself lying with her head facing an empty instrument tray.</p><p>"It has been quite some time since I have created a mark, but I don't think I'm too rusty." Tu Pei Set bustled around the room gathering up supplies. The most basic needs came first: a cup of water and towels. Bowls of pigment came next and Akane craned her neck up to see what colors were being used. There were rich reds and oranges, a deep golden yellow and a bowl with inky black. Finally, Tu Pei Set placed a set of needles where Akane could see them. Half of the needles looked like glass or tiny slivers of ice, while the others were black iron. All of them were very long and deadly sharp. Akane laid back down flat as Tu Pei Set returned.</p><p>Tu Pei Set leaned over Akane and spoke. "You fought valiantly tonight, like a true warrior. During your training you must have had some experience with pain, so bear this in mind: we are purified in pain and through pain can we be reborn."</p><p>Without another word, Tu Pei Set began. At first, when the needles slid under her skin, Akane felt a bit of cool icyness spread over her back, countering the sharp jabs she was feeling. It was almost pleasant. Tu Pei Set continued to work, stretching Akane's skin and slipping the needle just down far enough to leave a drop of ink. Yet as the elder went on, the cold seemed to intensify. Soon, Akane could feel a bleak and dreadful chill spreading out to her limbs. Akane focused, intent on preventing herself from shivering and ruining the tattoo. But the cold kept growing deeper and deeper. As the time stretched out, Akane could feel her heart slowing and her thoughts were sluggish and weird. She knew that she had no need to shiver any longer, a bad sign of hypothermia. But the needles continued until, at last, she though she couldn't take any more. Then suddenly, she felt a jab of heat. At first it burned against the cold, but eventually a delicious warmth flooded Akane's body and she felt that she could go on. Akane knew something about survival and prepared herself for the re-warming as a wave of violent shivering almost overtook her. Soon, though, the shivering passed and Akane found herself growing hotter and more uncomfortable. Akane felt feverish and she began to sweat from the heat of the tattoo. Tu Pei Set wiped Akane's back over and over again to keep the moisture from interfering with the inking. The needles were sending traces of fire arcing through Akane's back and cooking her. She longed to jump up and douse herself in cold water, but she held on through the burning pain. Again and again, Akane bore down and concentrated, unwilling to fail. Finally, a cold needle pierced her skin and Akane sighed with relief, but she knew her respite would be short lived. Throughout the night the tattooing continued, mind-numbing cold to feverish heat; back and forth from icy needles to firebrands. And still Akane held on, willing herself to endure the pain.</p><p>At long last, as the sun's rays peaked through the windows of the clinic, Tu Pei Set laid down her needles in the water cup and rested.  Akane lay still on the table, almost unwilling to believe that the pain had ended. Finally, she pushed herself up and looked questioningly at the exhausted Tu Pei Set.</p><p>"It is done. You have borne the fire and the ice in stillness and you are remade: a sister."</p><p>Akane turned and looked over her shoulder at her back in the mirror Tu Pei Set had brought. Akane smiled.</p><p>"So that's it. I became an Amazon, spent a few more months there, training like crazy with all these different masters, and then I was allowed to come back to Japan. I try to keep in touch with everybody there: Xian Po, Mu Tzu and even Khu Lon write once in a while. I went last summer and they sent me back with some secret scrolls for extra training. I am going to go again this summer and probably for a year when I go to college. Xian Po told me that she might come to Japan to visit, but I haven't heard from her in while."</p><p>Ranma took a long moment to stare into his empty cup. "Do you, like, follow all those Amazon laws? Kiss of death and everything?"</p><p>Akane crunched on a piece of ice. "Not really. I'm a part of the tribe, but I'm one hundred percent Japanese. I think they get that; I do owe them big time, though. Plus, I don't think I could kill anybody for any reason."</p><p>Ranma looked immensely relieved, but he still had another question. "And, like, you're best friends with Shampoo?"</p><p>"Yeah, she's great!" Akane said, glancing sidelong at Ranma.</p><p>"I dunno about great." Ranma mumbled under his breath.</p><p>Akane, though, clearly heard what Ranma said and turned fully to face him. "Look Ranma, you're dying to say something about the Amazons. Why don't you come out and say it?"</p><p>Ranma fidgeted with his cup again. After a minute of stammering, starting and stopping his story, Ranma began in earnest. "So, like, it was just after my dad and me fell in the cursed pools…"</p><p>It was Akane's turn to play the rapt audience. Disoriented by the recent cursing and lost in a strange land, Ranma described how he and his father had blundered past Xo Pu's defenses and into the Amazon village. Perhaps Xo Pu was relaxing after all, Akane mused. Or more likely, she corrected herself, luck favors fools and pandas. And who was this guide, who had led them to such a dangerous area without anything in the way of an explanation? As Akane listened, Ranma came to the crux of the story: the fight. Akane knew that Ranma was good. Knew it in a way that made her bones ache, but defeating Xian Po in one blow? That was almost unheard of! Akane could see where the story was going, like watching an accident in slow motion. Xian Po had always been a bit zealous and a loss like that was too great an insult to bear. She would probably end up chasing Ranma to the ends of the earth and she would eventually kill him!</p><p>A flash of understanding caused Akane's eyes to widen and she stopped Ranma. "Wait. Just wait a second. You must have been a girl when you beat Xian Po, right?"</p><p>"Yeah, I guess." Ranma said, finished with his story. "You're not going to turn me in, are you?"</p><p>"What? No, of course not." Akane waved Ranma's question away as she became lost in thought about the implications of the story. "It's just…Oh boy."</p><p>"What? What is it?" Ranma said, sitting forward and staring at Akane.</p><p>"It's…ah, the Amazons have different rules about being beaten by men and women."</p><p>"Like what?"</p><p>"Well, if it's a woman, the Amazon has to kill her, right? But with a man, she has to…how can I put this?" Akane looked helplessly at Ranma. "She has to marry him."</p><p>"What?" Ranma exploded, jumping to his feet and dropping his cup by accident. "That's crazy!"</p><p>Akane was just as emotional as Ranma. "I know. Xian Po is going to flip out when she finds out that you're a guy! Oh, god, and then when she finds out that we're going to get married…"</p><p>Ranma froze and looked down at Akane. "What did you just say?"</p><p>"She's going to flip out! I've got to talk to her."</p><p>"No, not that. You said…"</p><p>Ranma would have finished his sentence, but at that moment a very dirty, sweaty and angry Kimiko Tendo rounded the house and came straight for the both of them. "Akane, what are you doing? Get your butt into the yard and start working! Ranma, I told you to go get her an hour ago! I've been waiting. Your father is going to be home any second and I want things perfect for him!"</p><p>Akane looked from her mother up to a speechless Ranma. She decided quickly that her mother was in no mood to be trifled with. Her conversation with Ranma could wait until tomorrow. Maybe she could even get a hold of Xian Po before then. But first, she had to survive her mother's wrath. Akane put her lemonade glass down and nearly ran to the front yard. It was only fifteen minutes later, as Akane was knee deep in weeding the flower patch, when she realized exactly what she had said to Ranma.</p><p>Author's notes:</p><p>I got a little carried away with the flashback. I know it got a bit long, but it was a ton of fun to write and I hope you all enjoy it. This is also just another piece of the puzzle when it comes to why Akane is so good. The repercussions of the Amazon stuff will play out over the ensuing chapters. I kind of ducked the whole Ryoga thing, but in the cannon, he does get lost after he first comes to Furinkan and only fights Ranma a week later. The next chapter will definitely feature everyone's favorite bandanna boy and more awkward conversations about feelings. Oh boy!</p><p>In other news, I have a Ranma/DBZ fic that I put together a while ago. I was thinking about dusting it off and giving it another whirl on this site. Would you be interested in that sort of thing?</p><p>Always remember to take it easy!</p><p>C+C welcome and appreciated.</p>
