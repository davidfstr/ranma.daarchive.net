</div><p>The Tendo dojo was built in 1874, just after the end of the Edo period. The original land had been given to Asahito Tendo, a lowly Asigaru who had proven instrumental in quelling the Shogun's faithful during the Boshin War. Asahito had been born into a family of limited means, barely Samurai at all. In his boyhood, Asahito would go without many, many nights to give his siblings whatever food he could scrape together. As a result, he was always a small boy, but he was known far and wide to have had the fight of at least 2 grown men. During one fateful day, Asahito found his older sister being abused by three Ronin over the theft of a crust of bread. Asahito flew into such a rage that he snatched up whatever was close at hand and began beating the men severely. The swords and spears of the Ronin proved no match for the pots, rocks and bare fists that Asahito used against them. After the men fled, carrying one of their comrades between them, Asahito and his sister were approached by none other than Saigo Takamori. Takamori had seen Asahito's fight and offered to have the young man trained in the warrior arts. Over the next several years, Asahito underwent countless hardships in training. As a result of Takamori's assistance, though, Asahito became a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, a difference of opinion about the future of Japan separated master from student just a few years later, and Asahito and Takamori became de facto enemies, though they never lost affection for one another. Although he never wore a Katana, Asahito Tendo was counted among one of the Meji governments deadliest men during the Boshin war. Subsequently, Asahito's efforts were recognized by the ruling party and he was given a small grant of land in Edo. Over the years, Asahito found clans of like-minded warriors, such as the famed Saotomes, and built a dojo to pass along the techniques they had pioneered. The dojo was a place that Asahito meant to stand the test of time. It is unclear why Asahito originally choose to import fire-hardened oak for the support beams of the dojo he created, but as Ranma lay dazed on the floor, he was forced to admit they had done their job admirably.</p><p>Bill presents:</p><p>Ranma ½, A Man's Woman</p><p>Part Eight: Going down, all the way</p><p>"Hits like a savage…." Ranma mumbled as he came to. Looking upwards from his supine position, he could see the place where he had struck the support beam. He was strangely proud that his body had even been able to dent the heavy blackened wood. As Ranma tried to sit up, he felt a fiery pain tear through his midsection. Panting, Ranma was forced to lie back down. After a few seconds, the pain abated and he gently tugged at his shirt to expose his abdomen and craned his neck to see where he was injured. Ranma groaned as his stomach appeared to be one giant mass of blue and purple. Gingerly, he tested his ribs and found at least two of them clearly broken.</p><p>As Ranma lay, he felt an arm slip under his shoulders and lift him gently into a seated position.</p><p>"Geeze, Ranma, you look like hell." Akane said, flopping down next to Ranma.</p><p>"Yeah, well, macho chicks always hit too hard." Ranma's voice was bitter, but at the same time Akane did not look much better. She was a sweaty mass of hair and bruises and she had a fresh cut under her chin from where she had caught an elbow during the fight. Some of the blood had even run down her neck and crusted over.</p><p>"That was a great fight." Akane said, trying to ignore Ranma's rancor. Almost as if to prove her nonchalance, Akane settled back onto her elbows.</p><p>"It was great? What were you trying to do, kill me?" Ranma said angrily.</p><p>"We were sparring! What did you want me to do, let you win?" Akane nearly shouted, giving in to her own anger.</p><p>"I don't need you to…" Ranma found himself at a loss for words, but he was still furious. His face twisted into a mask of rage as he attempted to push himself up to standing. Still, he groaned as red-hot lances of pain shot through his midsection.</p><p>"You should go see my mom." Akane said, her voice colored by irritation. Still, she put her arm under Ranma's shoulders and tried to lift him up.</p><p>"Get offa me, you stupid tomboy." Ranma said, shoving Akane away with as much force as he could muster. In that moment, Ranma wanted to hurt Akane, wanted to see her cry. "Maybe we should have bet. Then you could be just like your dad!"</p><p>Akane didn't step back from the weak push, but none the less she found herself struggling for balance after what Ranma had said. Akane did not fall, though. Instead she screamed and shoved Ranma back, hard enough to knock him aside. "Ranma, you idiot!"</p><p>As Akane fled the dojo, Ranma nearly fell back down, but he found himself caught, none too gently, by Soun Tendo's iron grip around his bicep. Soun was staring down at Ranma, a frown creasing the older man's face. "That wasn't very nice, Ranma. Go see Kimiko, now."</p><p>"Don't tell me what to do!" Ranma said, trying to shrug Soun's hand off, but the ache in his gut prevented him.</p><p>"This isn't a suggestion. Go." Soun released Ranma, turned on his heel and walked away.</p><p>Once inside her room, Akane slammed the door and flung herself down on her bed. She was still stiff from the fight, but her pain was nothing compared to the throbbing ache she felt in her chest. Stupid idiot, Akane thought savagely, but the hot tears on her pillow betrayed the anger she felt. As she lay there sobbing, Akane heard a knock on the door and Nabiki's voice asking gently to come in.</p><p>"Hey sis, what's wrong?" Nabiki said as she walked into the room.</p><p>Akane turned her head to look up at Nabiki and managed to choke out two words. "I won."</p><p>Nabiki looked down quizzically at Akane. "I don't know about you, but I think that's supposed to be a good thing. Why don't you tell me about it?"</p><p>As Akane rolled over, Nabiki saw that her sister looked like crap. Akane had apparently taken a severe beating during her sparring match and her face was even puffier from crying. Nabiki could see where her sister's tears had mixed with some dried blood and stained Akane's gi and her bed. Nabiki sat down carefully on the bed and brushed Akane's matted hair out of her face. This small gesture seemed to make Akane cry even harder.</p><p>"It's ok, Akane. Shhhh. It'll be alright." Nabiki stroked Akane's shoulder and tried to sooth her.</p><p>Soon Akane's crying abated enough that she was able to get through a sentence. "I worked so hard this week. I just thought, I dunno, that Ranma would be…"</p><p>"Happy for you?" Nabiki asked, finishing Akane's sentence.</p><p>"It's stupid." Akane sniffed. "How could that idiot be happy for me?"</p><p>"Yeah, he's a jerk." Nabiki offered.</p><p>"But things were getting better." Akane insisted. "We were going to teach the advanced class together. I thought that Ranma was nice." A fresh wave of sobs wracked Akane's body.</p><p>"I know. I know." Nabiki whispered. "Ranma is nice, he's just…how can I explain it?"</p><p>Akane sniffled again and looked up at Nabiki. "Explain what?"</p><p>"Don't take this the wrong way, but Ranma has made a lot of sacrifices in his life."</p><p>"So have I." Akane protested.</p><p>"You have, definitely. You work really hard, but think about everything that Ranma has gone through. He left his family, he's had no home. All he really had is the Art."</p><p>"So? Sometimes people are just better. I found a strong technique and I mastered it. I was smart and I worked hard. I deserved to win."</p><p>"Believe me, Akane, I know. But maybe you can see why Ranma is angry? You have this great family who owns a dojo, you are great in school, you're a better teacher than he is and now you're better than Ranma at martial arts. What does he have?"</p><p>"He's still a great martial artist. I don't even know if I can beat him again. Plus, I really stink at school." Akane was defensive, but Nabiki could see that her words were getting through.</p><p>"Ranma may have been a jerk to you, but you should cut the guy a little slack if you still want to be his friend."</p><p>Akane sat up and grabbed a tissue off of her nightstand to wipe her face. "I don't know if he'll still want to be friends with me. I don't even know if I want to be his friend now."</p><p>"I don't know Ranma that well, but I think he's pretty desperate for a friend. He'll come around."</p><p>Akane blew her nose and threw the tissue into the trashcan. The arc put the crumpled tissue paper in the dead center of the rim. "Well, I'm not going to apologize for beating him."</p><p>Nabiki looked over at the trashcan. She paused for a moment, choosing her words carefully. "I don't think you should. But just try to appreciate that he has worked really hard. It's like when we were kids. I used to resent you so much."</p><p>Akane's face dropped. "Really? Why?"</p><p>"I killed myself in the dojo and you always beat the pants off of me." Nabiki laughed. "My younger sister! It only got a little better when you started training with me. It showed me how hard you were working and you always pushed me, like you thought I could be great."</p><p>"And that helped?"</p><p>"Not at first, but it got through to me eventually." Nabiki leaned over and, despite how disgusting Akane was, she gave her sister a hug.</p><p>"Thanks sis." Akane whispered into Nabiki's ear.</p><p>Nabiki disentangled herself from Akane and made an attempt to brush off the new stains on her shirt. "Don't mention it. But seriously Akane, if you're so bad at school, how come you never go to cram class?"</p><p>"You don't know? Heh." Akane gave a nervous laugh. "My grades aren't good enough to get into your cram class. That's why mom is always pushing me. She doesn't want me to fail out of high school."</p><p>"Mom pushes me too." It was Nabiki's turn to get defensive, but Akane continued on, teasingly.</p><p>"She just does that because you're her favorite. You're the only one who could go to medical school like she did."</p><p>"Really?" Nabiki, not bothering to hide how proud she felt.</p><p>"Of course. Now get out of here." Akane said playfully and glanced up at the clock. "Oh jeeze, I've got to get cleaned up for the next class."</p><p>Nabiki gestured down at her shirt. "So do I."</p><p>Ranma knocked weakly at the door to Mrs. Tendo's study. He was barely standing upright, leaning on the wall for support. He heard some rustling from within and a muffled sound that may well have been 'come in'. Ranma nearly fell against the door, pushing it open. Inside he found Mrs. Tendo nearly buried in a mountain of papers. The room looked like a library had exploded and Mrs. Tendo had been seated at the epicenter of the disaster. Mrs. Tendo was still dressed in her pajamas, her hair was mussed and it looked like she hadn't slept much the previous night. She was sifting through some of the books in front of her and didn't look up as Ranma staggered in.</p><p>"What?" Mrs. Tendo demanded without looking up. Her voice was tinged with impatience.</p><p>"Uh, could I get a little help?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Oh, Ranma, I didn't realize…" Kimiko caught sight of Ranma and stopped. She stood up immediately, dumping the books off of her lap. "Oh, dear. Come over here and sit down."</p><p>Ranma stumbled over to the exam table and flopped himself down on it. He groaned as his ribs shifted under the weight of his body. Kimiko didn't say a word, but immediately came to Ranma's side and placed her hands on his chest. A familiar glow began to accumulate around Mrs. Tendo's fingers and at the same time a sense of warmth and serenity spread through Ranma's body. After another minute or two, Kimiko began gently kneading Ranma's abdomen. The pain was intense and Ranma writhed under Kimiko's strong hands. Just as the pain seemed to abate and Ranma lay still, Kimiko pressed hard on Ranma's side and snapped his ribs back into place. Ranma gasped at the sting and the suddenness of it, but almost immediately the ache subsided and he found that he could move more freely.</p><p>Kimiko looked down at Ranma. She was clearly trying to remain calm, but her voice was still sharp. "Ribs don't usually get out of place like that. Did Soun do this?"</p><p>"No." Ranma turned his face away as Mrs. Tendo continued to work on some of the smaller injuries he had suffered.</p><p>"Oh, I see." Another minute passed. "How did she manage to do this?"</p><p>Ranma hesitated, but then answered. "I don't know. It felt like she hit me about a hundred times with one punch."</p><p>Kimiko pressed a few acupuncture points to control Ranma's pain further. "That sounds like Akane. Tell me about the fight."</p><p>"Really?" Ranma seemed genuinely surprised that Mrs. Tendo would want to hear about his training. "Well, it was pretty obvious right for the beginning of the match that Akane had some new technique she had learned. Her hands were way faster than before, but I compensated. I threw her some moves she obviously hadn't seen and it put her off of her game. And then, right as I'm about to finish her off, she hits me like a ton of rocks."</p><p>"What were these moves, as you put it?"</p><p>"Ah, you shoulda seen me. I was using Taido, Wu Shu, and anything else I could think of. Akane had to take time to set up each speed punch. The way I was attacking, she didn't know which way was which."</p><p>"I see, you used her speed against her. That's very smart Ranma."</p><p>"Thanks." Ranma's face brightened for a moment, but then fell just as quickly. "But still, I got beat."</p><p>"Yes." Kimiko said, beginning to straighten out the chi flow into Ranma's abdomen. "But this is training. I am sure you will find some new way to challenge my daughter and she, in turn, will challenge you right back. You will both be better for it."</p><p>Ranma looked thoughtful as Kimiko turned away and waded through the piles of papers over to one of her shelves. She took down a clay pot and poured some golden oil into a pestle. After that, Kimiko grabbed several jars from the selves and began empting the contents into the pestle one by one. As she ground the herbs, a bitter scent filled the room and it made Ranma's head spin a little bit.</p><p>Once Kimiko seemed satisfied with the mix of herbs, she worked her way back over to Ranma. "Was Akane really that fast?"</p><p>"Yeah, it was like no matter what I did, she was right there."</p><p>"Hmmmm. She's gotten into the Amazon techniques already. That was quick."</p><p>Kimiko could feel Ranma's muscles tense under her fingers as she smeared the paste from the pestle onto his ribs. Ranma was attempting to look laid-back, and he may have even tried to whistle through split lips, but it was clear that he had something to say about the subject. Kimiko had learned long ago how to deal with sensitive men, so she didn't push. As she continued to work in silence, Ranma relaxed again.</p><p>"There." After Kimiko had finished applying the liniment, she had Ranma sit up and wrapped his torso in gauze. "If you heal as fast as my daughter then you only need to take it easy for the next few weeks. That means no training and no sparring."</p><p>"Come on. I need to train if I'm going to beat Akane!" Ranma protested.</p><p>"Well, I'm afraid that's not going to happen for a while yet."</p><p>"Argh, what am I supposed to do to beat that stupid…" Ranma stopped himself as the expression on Mrs. Tendo's face darkened. "I mean, uh, I've got to get a lot better fast."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>It was a simple question, but it stopped Ranma cold. As he sat on the exam table, he found that he could not think of an answer. Several things came to quickly to mind: because he had pride in the art, to be the best, to show everyone how good he really was. But none of those seemed sufficient to answer Mrs. Tendo's question. Maybe it was that she still looked like she had rolled out of bed and such lofty goals were too much for a Sunday morning. But more likely it was the way Mrs. Tendo was looking at Ranma, with a mixture of pride and concern, that seemed so familiar and yet so foreign to him. It was unsettling in a way that Ranma could not name. Ranma shook his head and said the only honest thing he could think of. "Because I need to."</p><p>Kimiko looked long and hard at Ranma. It was easy to see him as one of her own children, in need of help and protection. But Ranma was not like her girls, for good or for ill. There were things about this boy that she could not begin to fathom, but Kimiko felt compelled to try. She took another few seconds to consider her actions and then spoke. "Well, there are techniques you could learn without stressing your body."</p><p>"Like what?"</p><p>"Well, I think I have just the thing. My partner, Dr. Tofu, and I have invented a form that we call the Apian Fist."</p><p>Ranma cocked his head to the side. "Apian?"</p><p>"Like a bee, Ranma. Apian means bee-like. It has two parts, and neither requires that much movement. I think it will be something you can practice while you are healing."</p><p>"How can I get better if I don't really train?"</p><p>"Oh dear, you are going to have to train very diligently if you want to master this. Akane has been studying it, but she has not been very serious about it. I think if you push yourself, you might be able to surpass her."</p><p>Ranma cracked his knuckles and smiled at Mrs. Tendo. She was not entirely reassured as Ranma's aura flared to life, smoldering around him. "Sounds good to me."</p><p>The next day, Akane woke up early to train, more because she was used to it than because she had a particular plan in mind. As she padded through the house, she thought about how surprisingly enjoyable dinner had been the night before. Ranma had been in a good mood, not laughing and joking, but at least pleasant. The odd thing was that he had spent the entire meal wearing sun glasses. The glasses were too dark for the indoors and they had made Ranma clumsy. Nabiki had made some joke about an American movie star, but Ranma had refused to take the glasses off. Akane wondered about the change, especially when Ranma choose to stay up late watching the Koi pond, but she was fairly certain this new strangeness, like so many others, would work itself out.</p><p>Inside the dojo, Akane found her father was already there. Soun was kneeling down in meditation, his eyes closed and his posture serene. He must have been working out by himself, because he was covered in sweat. In fact, Akane noticed, her dad looked downright beaten. There was a small rip on his gi sleeve that had not been there the day before. On closer inspection, Soun also looked like his shoulder was bothering him and perhaps there was a bruise at his temple. With no hint of how her father could have been injured, Akane shrugged and went up to her him. Seeing no other alternative, Akane knelt down in front of her father, mirroring his pose. After a few seconds, Soun opened up his eyes.</p><p>"Good morning, my little fighter. How are you?"</p><p>"Good morning, Daddy. What are we going to be doing today? Strength work?"</p><p>"Ah, no. I wanted to talk to you about your fight yesterday, particularly your new technique."</p><p>Akane beamed. "Wasn't it great! Ranma is still mad, but you saw me: I trashed him!"</p><p>Soun did not share his daughter's enthusiasm. "Yes, I saw the fight and you were great. You won, but…how can I say this? You relied too much on your new technique and Ranma saw the very obvious flaws. If the fight had gone on for much longer, you would have lost."</p><p>Akane sat silently, stunned. He father was often blunt in his assessment of student's techniques, but he was rarely this harsh. More disturbingly, Akane knew that her father was rarely wrong. Even if he was brusque, he might have a point. "What do you mean, 'flaws'?"</p><p>Soun collected his thoughts for a moment. "Perhaps flaw is too strong a criticism. Your technique was powerful but it was also one-dimensional, flat, and lacking."</p><p>Akane found herself growing a little heated. She knew objectively that her father was just trying to help her, but his attitude was starting to grate on her. "Well, what do you suggest, Sensei?"</p><p>"I suggest you not take that tone with me." Soun stopped and wiped his face. "I am sorry daughter, you were brilliant, both in your choice of technique and the application. I am not trying to impugn your effort or your skill. Rather, I would like to help you take the next step in your training."</p><p>"Next step?" Akane asked, more curious than annoyed now.</p><p>"Yes. A real step towards mastery of the Art." Soun paused to let his words sink in. While Akane was pondering what was to come next, Soun stood up. He began pacing the floor as he liked to do. At times like this, Soun always found he could keep his mind clear by keeping his feet moving. "Consider this: there are few people as dangerous as the man who can see his own flaws and is given the time to fix them."</p><p>Akane remained kneeling as her father walked back and forth across the dojo floor. She thought about what he had said. "I think I get it, Daddy. I should have taken the time to analyze the Amaguriken before I used it."</p><p>"Is that the full name of the technique? No matter, you are completely correct. Tell me, what are the flaws of this Amaguriken?"</p><p>Akane bowed her head down in thought. She pictured the fight yesterday, not from the perspective of a proud winner, but with a jaundiced eye. She saw each blow Ranma had delivered and each blow that she had failed to deliver. It was depressing, but in a way, liberating. The day before, the fight had been about winner and loser; Ranma was angry and she was guilty. Instead, she now saw the fight as an autopsy and she was playing the role of the doctor. Akane found herself laying aside each layer of her match in a search for truth. She asked herself questions with clinical precision. Where had she failed? And more importantly, why? How could she improve?</p><p>Akane sighed and looked at her father. "For starters, I can only move my hands quickly. The rest of my body is just as slow as it was before. The other, and probably more important thing is that I can't react as fast as I can move. It leaves a gap in my actions where I am open."</p><p>"Good, those are honest assessments. Now for the second, and arguably harder, part. How can you improve those things?"</p><p>"Well, I guess we could…"</p><p>Soun turned back towards where Akane was still kneeling and made a curt gesture with his hand. "There will be no we here, little fighter. I will be leaving later today on some business. I want you to tackle these problems on your own. Show me what you have taught yourself when I return."</p><p>"Uh, ok Daddy. Where are you going?"</p><p>"To Australia. There is a scroll there I need to acquire."</p><p>"Alright." Akane said, standing up and walking outside on her own. "I guess I'd better get started."</p><p>As Akane walked into the breakfast room after training, she noticed Ranma sitting out on the porch, still with the sunglasses on, still staring at the Koi pond. He was in the identical spot he had been the night before and, even more disturbingly, he was wearing the same outfit as he had been the day before.</p><p>"Good morning Ranma. Did you stay up all night?" Akane asked. She found herself still feeling a little guilty from yesterday.</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma responded sleepily, turning around to face Akane. "Whoa, your face!"</p><p>"Oh, real nice. I was just saying good morning." Akane huffed and went to take a seat at the table.</p><p>Ranma got up from the porch and maneuvered over to the table. He was much more agile than the night before. "No, I didn't mean that. It's just that your face looks so…I dunno, luminous."</p><p>"Really? Thanks Ranma." Akane blushed and laid a hand on her cheek.</p><p>"Um, you're welcome?" Ranma said, puzzled. He helped himself to a large serving of the eggs sandwiches Mrs. Tendo had laid out on the table. She claimed that they were another of her culinary triumphs.</p><p>"I don't think McDonald's counts as a specialty Mom!" Akane yelled into the kitchen while taking a sandwich for herself.</p><p>"Sure it does, dear." Kimiko said, brining out more orange juice to the table.</p><p>"Hey, is Nabiki up yet? She's going to be late." Akane asked.</p><p>"Right here sis." Nabiki said, stretching as she entered the room. She was still wearing pajamas and her hair was matted to the side from sleeping.</p><p>"What are you doing? Go get ready!" Akane chided.</p><p>"Why? I don't have school for another hour." Nabiki said nonchalantly, sitting down and selecting an Egg McMuffin for herself.</p><p>"What?" Akane and Ranma asked in unison.</p><p>"Didn't I tell you? I took a test to pass out of differential equations class last week. They just called with the results this morning while you were training. That's as high as Furinkan goes, so I don't have to take any more math if I don't want to." Nabiki winked at Akane as she took a nibble of her sandwich.</p><p>"So what are you going to do?" Akane asked, still not understanding, but clearly jealous.</p><p>"Well, I have it on good authority that high school students can take higher math at the community college, if they want."</p><p>"Where did you hear…" Akane stopped and looked at Nabiki's sly grin. "Motorcycle guy is doing that too, isn't he? Oh, Nabiki, you are so lucky!"</p><p>"Luck has nothing to do with it, little sister. And, as an added bonus, Kuno and all those idiots will already be in class when I arrive at school. Life is good."</p><p>"Oh, Nabiki, that is such good news!" Akane leaned over the table and hugged Nabiki around the neck.</p><p>"Hey, that's really great Nabiki." Ranma added. "Unfortunately, us morons still have to get to class. Come on Akane."</p><p>Kimiko caught Akane and Ranma at the door. "Akane, don't forget to kiss your father goodbye. He's going on a, uh…business trip."</p><p>"I already did, Mom. Love ya!"</p><p>For Ranma, the end of every school day was like a new shackles of oppressive boredom and mind numbing inanity were thrown off and he was reborn. It was not that Ranma was a bad student. In fact, he was quite clever. Ranma just preferred to learn things on his own, rather than have a lecturer drone on about some topic or another. If Ranma's teachers had possessed a background in educational theory, they might have called this Student Directed Learning and Ranma would have been praised for his initiative; it was the way he learned martial arts and it was also the way he learned most everything else. Instead, the idea of learning-by-doing was actively quashed by the Japanese school system in favor of a regimented and entirely unimaginative curriculum. It was only after the bell rang that Ranma was able to go out into the world and actually learn anything at all. And so, like a phoenix rising from the ashes of monotony, Ranma came alive when the teachers shut up.</p><p>"Ranma! Stop!"</p><p>"Come and get me!" Ranma teased, moving away from Akane as fast as his injured side would allow him. The glasses were getting easier and easier to handle and Ranma moved like the wind through the student who were still hanging around the school yard. Suddenly, Ranma's sixth sense for danger tingled. He was a veteran of so many battles that it was almost impossible for an opponent to catch him off guard. Ranma's whipped off his glasses and his eyes flashed over the school yard. True to his instincts, Ranma saw motion on both sides of his peripheral vision.</p><p>"Ranma Saotome, prepare to die!" Looking upwards, a boy was poised at the apex of a leap above Ranma, bringing an unlikely weapon to bear. Still, Ranma knew how much damage that he himself could do with an umbrella, so it was best to just avoid it. Without another thought, Ranma spun sideways, the only move he could accomplish without jarring his ribs. As the umbrella descended, the second blur in Ranma's visual field resolved itself into Akane, who promptly shoulder checked the newcomer across the school yard. The umbrella never even had a change to make contact and it was knocked away.</p><p>"Don't interfere in a man to man fight!" Ranma chided Akane.</p><p>"Do you even know who that is?" Akane snapped back, sticking out her tongue.</p><p>The other boy pushed himself up from the grass where he had been thrown and shot a black smile at Ranma. "Still getting girls to do your dirty work, eh Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma focused on the newcomer. He knew the answer to Akane's question but his mind still felt sluggish from the tedium of school. "Sure, it's, ah…you know…he's, he's, he's…"</p><p>"Don't strain your brain remembering." Akane said sarcastically.</p><p>"Just tell me one thing, Ranma." The new boy retrieved his umbrella from where it had been thrown. "Why did you run out on our fight?"</p><p>Ranma slapped his fist into his hand as inspiration struck. "Wait! I remember. You were in my class at my old high school. Ryoga Hibiki! Long time no see!"</p><p>"Answer my question!" Ryoga snapped. This was not going at all like he had planned. Ranma had clearly not taken the fight as seriously as Ryoga himself had. What's more, the girl with Ranma seemed to be making light of the situation and, even worse, she seemed to be a competent fighter.</p><p>"I waited three days at the appointed place." Ranma said, confused.</p><p>"Three days?" Akane asked, hiding a smirk behind her hand.</p><p>Ryoga clenched his fist in front of his face. Ranma would not embarrass him again. Instead, the whole world would know of Ranma's cowardice. "Yes! And when I came on the fourth day, you had already run away!"</p><p>"Uh…Ryoga, can I ask you something?" Ranma took a deep breath. "Why did it take you four days to get there?"</p><p>Ryoga exploded in rage. "Why you! Do you think I was out for a casual stroll for four days? I suffered to meet up with you!"</p><p>And again the whispering began. Ryoga knew all the words by heart, yet they still cut him each and every time the crossed some bystander's lips. He was a martial artist and his opponents should have the honor to face him in combat. How dare anyone besmirch him for such a tiny flaw? Directions were meaningless anyway. They would pay. No! Ranma would pay!</p><p>"Breaking a vow between men and running to China with your father!" Ryoga ran forward and slashed at Ranma with his umbrella.</p><p>Ranma didn't think he could move quickly enough to get out of the way, so he threw up his forearm to block. The impact of the umbrella was much heavier than Ranma had anticipated and he felt his side scream in protest. When Ryoga made no second attack, Ranma stepped back and rubbed the bandage under his shirt. "In other words, you want to finish our fight?"</p><p>"Finish our fight?" Ryoga said mockingly, snapping the umbrella open. "How feeble! This is revenge!"</p><p>And with that, Ryoga let the umbrella fly. Ranma was now aware of the heft of the umbrella, but he had seen how deftly Ryoga used it, so he was not caught off guard. Ranma calmly leaned to the side and let the umbrella pass by him entirely. Again, the instincts honed over years of training served Ranma well. He had a gut feeling about the flight path of the umbrella and so he leaned the other way as it came screaming back around. It missed him again. Ryoga's face clearly showed his annoyance as he adroitly snatched the umbrella out of the air.</p><p>"No matter what it takes Ranma, I shall destroy your happiness."</p><p>"My…happiness…" Ranma said mostly to himself, stunned. He turned to Akane, more to confirm than to question. "Am I happy?"</p><p>"Don't ask me."</p><p>Author's notes:</p><p>Hey! I want to honestly thank everyone who wrote criticisms of the last chapter. I tried to use everyone's feelings about Ranma and Akane to make the dialogue of this chapter ring true. I hope I succeeded. In other news, I am really liking the way Ranma and Kimiko's relationship is shaping up. Finally, I enjoyed rewriting the first Ryoga scene. I felt like it would actually play out like the cannon, so I tried to keep things as similar as I could. But the big questions is: will Ranma be able to win against Ryoga with healing ribs?</p><p>Always remember to take it easy!</p><p>Oh, and C+C always welcome. The more the better, I always say!</p>
