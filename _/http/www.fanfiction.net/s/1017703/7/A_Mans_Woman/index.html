</div><p>Ranma had never been much of a teacher. Life on the road and few friends had given him a dulled, some would say blunt, understanding of human nature. As for his role model, Genma had always taken a sink or swim approach to teaching. More accurately his father's method could be called dodge or get punched in the face. But Ranma felt he had been well trained and so intended to pass on his knowledge in the same manner in which he had received it: painfully. Though Ranma wanted to pitch in, Soun Tendo's advanced classes were no place for a fledgling teacher to embark on his career. But Soun, seeking to repair the rift between Ranma and himself, had been quick to acquiesce. Ranma was made assistant instructor to the senior class. To Ranma, the students were nice enough on the Monday when he first met them. Kaito, the fat, balding man who moved like a whisper and laughed like a hippo. Ayaka, the slight woman who fought with knitting needles and even made a scarf during a sparring session. Karu and Kiyoshi, the twins who were always either joking or snacking, sometimes simultaneously. And finally, Gorou, the ring leader: glasses like Buddy Holly, a voice like an angle and a body like Godzilla. None were a match for Ranma or Akane in a straight fight, but as Ranma's first week as assistant instructor wore on, the group began to chafe under his yoke. The harder Ranma pushed in class, the more the students resisted. The more the students refuse to give in, the more Ranma drove them on. That Friday, a cold and dry night, the issue had come to a head. By the end of class, Ranma had learned the truth behind that old Buddhist saying: 'A knitting needle in the thigh is just as painful as it sounds.'</p><p>Bill presents:</p><p>Ranma ½, A Man's Woman</p><p>Part Seven: Just lob it over the plate</p><p>"She stabbed me!"</p><p>"It was no less than you deserved." Akane said angrily, as she began cleaning the wound on Ranma's leg. Class had ended abruptly and Soun had ushered the students out hastily. Akane and Ranma sat in the center of the dojo. A discarded knitting needle lay off to the side. On closer inspection, the tip was wet with blood.</p><p>"I deserved it? What did you say that for?" Ranma winced as the iodine went on. As he looked down at the work Akane was doing, he noticed that her hands were pink and raw, with a small fire-blister on one of her knuckles. He couldn't help but compare Akane's hands to her mother's. Both were delicate but strong, and apparently they both got burned rather easily.</p><p>"Ayaka is a perfectly reasonable woman, but you kept pushing her and pushing her. She was bound to snap at you. I'm surprised the others didn't join her."</p><p>"That's crazy! The true martial artist should do what the Sensei says without complaint." Ranma said, repeating a line he had heard a hundred or more times from his father.</p><p>"Jeeze, Ranma. These people aren't like that. Ayaka can't be a full-time martial artist. She runs a yarn store most of the time. She isn't some fanatic like…"</p><p>"Like who?" Ranma demanded, looking sharply at Akane. "Like me? Is that what you were going to say?"</p><p>"I was going to say, 'like us.'" Akane shot back, giving the bandage a sharp tug.</p><p>"Ouch! Yeah, well, I still don't think I needed to be stabbed."</p><p>"No, you didn't. But you just have to learn to be patient with them. Sometimes students improve more when the Sensei steps back."</p><p>"And sometimes they learn better when the Sensei pushes them."</p><p>"You are so stubborn! Doesn't the fact that your student stabbed you mean anything to you?"</p><p>"Yeah, it means that Ayaka's crazy!"</p><p>"She is not! She just needs a good teacher."</p><p>"Like who?"</p><p>"Maybe someone like me." Akane said with a note of jealousy in her voice.</p><p>"But you teach the kid's classes." Ranma protested.</p><p>Akane finished applying the bandage to Ranma's leg and checked it over. It was just as her mother had taught her: tight, but not enough to cut off the circulation. As Akane looked up, she noticed for the first time how close she was to Ranma and she blushed with self-consciousness. Her hair was messy and she no doubt smelled like a workout. Even more disturbingly, Akane realized that her gi top was ever so slightly open.</p><p>Ranma, too, had apparently noticed and he was doing his best to look everywhere but at Akane. It was difficult with her perched right over his leg, but he managed. Even turned away, Ranma found that he could still smell the clean sweat on Akane and feel the heat from her body. Ranma saw Akane shiver out of the corner of his eye and he turned to look at her.</p><p>"Ranma?" Akane whispered. 'I've got an idea."</p><p>"An idea?" Ranma swallowed hard. He could feel Akane's hot breath on his neck and he started to sweat again.</p><p>"I know a way we could decide."</p><p>"Decide what?" Ranma said, his eyes going wide.</p><p>Akane heaved herself up and began busily collecting the first-aid supplies. "Who gets to teach the advanced class, of course. Why don't we let our next sparring match determine it? I win and I get to teach. If you win, you keep teaching."</p><p>Ranma choked at the abrupt change in topics. "Yeah, um, sure. Whatever you say."</p><p>With the first-aid kit back in place, Akane smiled and walked out of the dojo. She didn't have time to see Ranma collapse flat on his back behind her.</p><p>Inside the house, Akane found Nabiki in the front hallway taking off her coat and shoes. Nabiki had a large bag of books slung over one shoulder.</p><p>"Back from cram class?" Akane asked, grabbing Nabiki's heavy coat from her and putting it in the closet.</p><p>"Yeah. Study, study, study. Are you going to be coming next semester?"</p><p>"Ugh, no way. It takes too much time. I don't know how you can manage it."</p><p>"It isn't easy, but it's the only way I'll get into a halfway decent college and that's the only way I'll go to grad school. Plus there are other advantages." Nabiki arched an eyebrow to convey her meaning.</p><p>"Oooo, was he there again tonight?" Akane giggled and hugged Nabiki around the waist. They both walked into the kitchen.</p><p>"Yeah, he had a biker jacket on over his uniform today. He looked so good. Do you think he drives a motorcycle?"</p><p>"He sounds like the type. Did you talk to him?"</p><p>"No, of course not. All the girls in the class just flock to him. Even if I could work up the courage, I don't think I could even get near him." Nabiki grabbed a soda out of the fridge for herself and tossed a bottle of water to Akane.</p><p>"Courage?" Akane snorted. "You fight all the men's teams every day, not to mention the Kuno himself. You'll talk to him next time."</p><p>"Those jerks are half the reason I'm going to cram school. I can't meet a descent guy in high school; Kuno would just kill him. Now that I can talk to a guy, though, what happens? I can't even form the words."</p><p>"Yeah, I know it stinks. Guys suck."</p><p>"No, just the guys at our school. Speaking of which, how are things going with Ranma?" Nabiki smiled at Akane over the lid of her soda can.</p><p>Akane didn't understand Nabiki's meaning, or else choose to ignore it. "Ranma's being a jerk. He is teaching the advanced class and doing a terrible job."</p><p>Nabiki looked suspicious. "Daddy is making Ranma teach the advanced class? We only ever taught the kids classes. Do you think Daddy's doing it because Ranma's a guy?"</p><p>"No, Ranma asked for it. Daddy said that he was glad to see Ranma taking some responsibility. I would have done it if I had known that I could."</p><p>"Huh." Nabiki looked thoughtful as she drained her soda can. "Maybe there's something to that. You know, 'responsibility', 'character building' and such."</p><p>"Yeah, well I don't think Ranma should have this responsibility. I could do better." Akane crossed her arms in front of herself.</p><p>"Just give him some time. I'm sure he'll get the hang of it." Nabiki tossed the soda can towards the garbage. It clanged against the rim and landed on the floor. "Or not."</p><p>"We'll see about that." Akane said, pushing herself up from the table with a maniacal gleam in her eye.</p><p>"Uh oh, I know that look. Just be careful training, ok sis?"</p><p>Akane bent down to grab the errant soda can. With casual savagery she crushed it in her hand. "It's Ranma you should be worried about, not me."</p><p>Slamming the can into the garbage, Akane headed outside to train.</p><p>Ranma sat down heavily on his futon and looked around the room the Tendo's had given him. It was small, but to a person who had lived their life on the road, it was a palace. After his father had left, Mrs. Tendo had insisted he take this room to, 'have a nice place of his own.' And it was nice. Mrs. Tendo had clearly spent a few nights cleaning the place; Ranma didn't think he could find a speck of dirt in the room. And it smelled great: a gentle combination of sweetness and fresh flowers. Ranma looked up to the vase on the dresser and the artfully arranged bouquet it held. For the first time he noticed a small picture frame tucked behind the vase and he got up to investigate.</p><p>The frame held a picture of the three Tendo girls at the beach when they were younger. A short, girlish Akane was standing between Nabiki and a coltish Kasumi. All three were sticky-faced, holding watermelons and bokkens; only Akane's watermelon seemed to be intact, but all three girls were smiling in the summer sun. Ranma looked closer and he could see the lines on Akane's young face that would mature and change to produce the pretty girl he had come to know.</p><p>Ranma sat back down on the futon, picture frame still in hand. He wondered if he would ever have that kind of day, just fun and relaxation. As Ranma looked down at the picture, he considered putting it in his pack as a souvenir of the time he had spent here. But as he grabbed his bag and opened it up, he glanced at the picture once again. The girls really did look happy. Instead of squirreling it away, Ranma stood up and put the picture back on the dresser next to the vase.</p><p>After straightening the picture, Ranma reached down to his open pack and began putting his clothes away in the dresser.</p><p>From Akane's perspective, weekends at the Tendo house were just as busy as the weekdays, if not more so. Children's classes took up much of the early part of the day for her. Far from being a burden, though, Akane loved teaching kids and she took her responsibility very seriously. She found it easy and natural to design games for the students to play; games that taught coordination, speed and strength. The kids, though, loved the silliness of Akane's methods and were always happy when the weekends rolled around. Even though Akane was teaching, her parents still kept on her about all her other responsibilities like chores, homework and above all else, training.</p><p>"Look Ranma, we have an hour before the next class starts. Let's spar."</p><p>"Not now, Akane. I want to practice this." Ranma was midway through another round of the Limitless Freedom form. Ranma was proud of how far he had come along, so much so that he could now complete most of it quickly without the chi overdrive that Soun had shown him.</p><p>"Come on! A week ago you said you hated forms."</p><p>Ranma flipped over backwards and landed in the splits. "Well, not now. Leave me alone!"</p><p>Akane stuck out her tongue at Ranma as he leapt into the air and began a series of rapid fire kicks. "I bet you're just afraid to lose."</p><p>The jibe seemed to snap Ranma out of his concentration and he landed awkwardly. "Hey, I ain't afraid of anything!"</p><p>"Then fight!" Akane dropped into a low crouch with her hands poised in front of her.</p><p>"Alright, alright." Ranma said, stopping the form and coming to the center of the room to face Akane. "It's just…let's not bet, ok?"</p><p>"No way! You agreed."</p><p>Ranma turned away from Akane. "No. I want to keep teaching. I'll spar, but I'm not gonna bet. This isn't…I'm not going to let you trick me like your Dad did."</p><p>Akane dropped her guard immediately. As she stood facing Ranma's back, she could feel her face turning red. She suddenly felt incredibly guilty that she was using the same tactics she had admonished her father for just a week ago. "Oh, Ranma. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to… I just wanted a shot at the advanced class."</p><p>"It's ok." Ranma mumbled, still turned so that Akane couldn't see his face.</p><p>"If you still want to teach, of course you can." Akane stopped and looked at Ranma for a long time. She was still torn between her guilt and her desire to teach the advanced class. As she stood, Akane also began to wonder at the strength of Ranma's reaction. He was normally so hot tempered, but he seemed so touchy about this one thing. Eventually her curiosity won out. "Why do you want to teach?"</p><p>"I dunno." Ranma turned back towards Akane, but he didn't look at her as he raised his fists. "Actually, come on. Let's just spar."</p><p>Akane walked around so that she was in Ranma's line of sight. "No, seriously. Why is it so important to you to teach the advanced class?"</p><p>"Because, like, it's important to pass along the Art."</p><p>Akane looked at Ranma. Even though he was in a defiant stance, she could see that he was nervous and unsure, not at all like his normal demeanor. Akane realized that she would have to be gentle if she wanted the truth from Ranma. "Yeah, I feel like that too. Sometimes when I'm teaching the kid's class, I fell so proud even when they master something small."</p><p>Ranma let his hands fall to his sides. He had a wistful look on his face. "Totally. Like when the Sensei and the student are in sync, that's the best."</p><p>Slowly, Akane began to realize what Ranma was actually talking about. "Sometimes I feel like that with my Dad. The training is going so well and we just click."</p><p>Ranma almost winced when Akane said the word 'dad'. He looked down quickly. "Yeah, well, it seems like it's harder to click like that than I thought." And then softly, Ranma added. "I didn't think I'd miss it so much."</p><p>Akane could see how much Ranma was hurting. She tried to think of something to make him feel better. "You know, I think maybe it's easier with the kid's class."</p><p>"Yeah?" Ranma said, looking at Akane again.</p><p>"Oh, definitely. They're so excited and they really love to play." When Akane saw that Ranma was curious, she continued on. "You know what? Why don't you help me teach the kid's classes on the weekends? It's a lot of fun."</p><p>"That would be good." Ranma said and some of the sadness lifted from his face. As he looked at Akane, an idea seemed to occur to him. "Well, ya know. If I'm doing all this extra work helping you out with the kids, it seems only fair that you pitch in with the advanced class. Especially with all the crazies."</p><p>Akane's face broke into a radiant smile and she ran and hugged Ranma. "Really? Ranma, that would be so great!"</p><p>"Argh. Let go a me, ya tomboy!" Ranma wheezed as Akane crushed his ribs.</p><p>"Heh, sorry." Akane said, stepping back from a red and breathless Ranma. "Do you want to spar now?"</p><p>Ranma smiled. "You bet."</p><p>If you asked Soun Tendo about the happiest times of his life, he would probably have more than a few tales to tell. He wasn't a giddy or flighty man, prone to outbursts of emotion, but he did know how to savor the best life had to offer him. The day of his wedding, though it had been an unmitigated disaster, always stood out as a memory of pure joy. With the birth of each child, he logged another wonderful reflection that he would revisit from time to time. And then there were the smaller, less profound, moments: the first time Kasumi had learned to ride a bike. The camping trip when Nabiki had fallen in the river. A particularly splendid Moon festival with his wife. And this moment, when he walked into the dojo and saw Akane beating the snot out of Ranma.</p><p>To Soun, Akane was radiant. Whatever technique she had learned from the Amazon scrolls of her's, he mused, it had paid dividends. To be sure, Ranma had grown over the past week as well; the boy was faster and stronger and definitely tougher. The Limitless Freedom form fit his style like a hand in glove. Still, Akane had shown even more phenomenal development. As Ranma charged forward, he may as well have been moving in slow motion. Akane's hands were everywhere at once: intercepting attacks, twisting them away and hammering Ranma. Ranma, to his credit, was fighting admirably, absorbing tremendous punishment to create openings. But again and again Akane was able to anticipate Ranma's techniques and return the damage ten-fold.</p><p>Ranma, frustrated that the fight was almost entirely one sided, backed off to re-evaluate. Akane pursued him, but was content only to intercept the attacks Ranma threw to fend her off. Ranma wasn't sure what he could do. Akane was so fast! Everywhere he attacked, she was there. Ranma, though, had been in hundreds of battles and he was nothing if not adaptable. As Akane pressed the fight once more, Ranma began to twist his body sinuously, attacking from at impossible angles.</p><p>Soun saw Akane slap down at Ranma's hand as a punch seemed to come out of nowhere at all. Ranma was using a bizarre combination of Drunken Monkey and perhaps Brazilian Capoiera. Even now, he had shifted his attacks, spinning on his hands while lashing out with his feet. Akane was hard pressed to anticipate the attacks, and pulled her defenses in tighter. As Ranma flipped upwards, an elbow caught Akane on the chin and sent her stumbling backwards. Soun had to admit, the boy was brilliant. Ranma was capitalizing on the one flaw in Akane's technique. She could move her hands blisteringly fast, but she still couldn't see any faster than before. Ranma's unpredictable attacks were confusing Akane and putting her off her guard. It didn't matter that Akane was trading blow for blow with Ranma, she still felt defeated. And yet, as Ranma closed in for the coup de grace, Akane lashed out. There was a sound like a tree crashing down and Ranma flew backwards, smashing into the support beam and collapsing, suddenly defeated.</p><p>Akane held up her hand in victory and her knees buckled, sending her to the floor, exhausted.</p><p>Meanwhile, far out in the countryside, a young man faced down a wild boar.</p><p>Mating season had just begun and the rampaging beast had been driven into a frenzy by the expansion of a local town. The animal was at least six feet and the shoulder and its tusks had been sharpened to a razor's fineness in preparation for battle with other pigs. No other boar had been able to stand against it and in its fury at not finding a mate, the giant pig had run into the mountain town, crushing cars and seeking new foes to vanquish.</p><p>The townsfolk cried out for the bandanna'd young man, urging him to flee, or at least pretend to care for his own life. But the young man just looked on dispassionately as the giant pig bore down on him.</p><p>Seconds before the boar gored the young man, an umbrella seemed to come from nowhere, smashing into the pig's nose and stopping it cold. With a mere flick of his wrist, the young man sent the pig hurtling into the air. Seconds later it crashed down behind him, unconscious.</p><p>"D'you do them martial arts?" An old man asked as he approached, astonished.</p><p>"You've been practicin' up in thet mountain?" Another man said.</p><p>The young man held up a slip of paper. "Where is Furinkan High School?"</p><p>"Lemme see 'er." A farmer said reaching out for the paper. Behind him the other townspeople murmured excitedly.</p><p>"Say, ain't this Tokyo?" A younger man asked, gesturing down at the map.</p><p>"That's 500 miles north o' here." The farmer stated, more than a little amazed at the young man's lack of directional sense.</p><p>The young man sighed with a world weary shrug and turned away. "I see. Forgive the commotion."</p><p>As the young man walked out of the village, he heard the same comments he always did: lost, bad sense of direction, idiot. Even though he could crush the village in not time, his heart burned for only one fight. "Ranma Saotome! Prepare to meet me! You can hide from our man to man battle no longer!"</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>Thanks to everyone who has given me C+C on the previous chapters, especially Crono Drago for suggesting that Ranma get his own room. On other thoughts, it was difficult to write a fight where Ranma loses, but I think Akane's determination and the Amaguriken would definitely win the day. While I know that Akane winning against Ranma will change relationships, the repercussions of that will be played out over the next few chapters.</p><p>Always remember to take it easy!</p><p>Oh, and C+C always welcome. The more the better, I always say</p>
