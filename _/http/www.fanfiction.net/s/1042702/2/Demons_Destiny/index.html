</div><p>A Ranma 1/2 / Tenchi Muyo<i>!</i> Ryo-Ohki crossover series. Rated PG-13.</p><p>This story and a few others can be found on my web page at<br/>.com/jlfenton65/<p>Ranma 1/2 is a trademark of Viz Communications, Inc. and was created by Rumiko Takahashi.<br/>Tenchi Muyo<i>!</i> and its characters are the property of AIC and Pioneer LDC, Inc. and was created by Masaki Kajishima.<br/>This story is of my own derivation and is not intended for commercial purposes, so please don't sue me.</p><p>Author's Notes: This is a crossover with Tenchi Muyo<i>!</i> Ryo-Ohki. The time period is the standard time for Ranma, and the spring before the summer break when Tenchi would have released Ryoko in OVA episode 1 for Tenchi.</p><p><p style="text-align:center;">Demon's Destiny</p></p><p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter 2: The Past Catching Up With You</p></p><p><p style="text-align:center;">by Joe Fenton</p></p><p>A young woman with wild cyan hair and a skin-tight red and black outfit floated through the streets of Nerima following a giant panda. The panda glared at the girl and held out a sign.</p><p>'A <i>real</i> martial artist <i>walks</i> everywhere!'</p><p>Ranma smirked, "You're just jealous 'cause <i>I</i> can fly!" She smiled and flipped onto her back, still floating through the air with her hands laced under her head. "So why are we goin' to see this friend a yours?"</p><p>The panda held up another sign. 'You're going to meet your fiancée.'</p><p>Ranma almost hit the ground in shock. "WHAT? You picked out who you want me to marry without asking me?"</p><p>She stopped floating after the panda, hands on her hips. "Screw that! I'm goin' to find someone who can read the scroll!"</p><p>The panda tried to attack the floating girl. Before the blow could land, Ranma teleported to the side. The panda landed on a street sign, knocking it out of the ground. It picked up the sign and started trying to swat the floating figure from the sky.</p><p>Ranma just phased, allowing the sign to pass harmlessly through her body. "Quit it! You're making me <i>mad</i>, old man!"</p><p>The panda ignored her and kept trying to attack. Ranma's eyes glowed red. "That's it!"</p><p>The panda froze as Ranma powered up. It held out a sign. 'This is going to hurt.'</p><p>Ranma unleased exactly three ki-bolts before passing out and falling on top of the fried panda.</p><p>The panda gradually stirred, then pushed Ranma off so it could sit up. It levered itself up using the sign, then picked up Ranma and their packs.</p><p>Soun looked over the postcard once more. It said that today, his old friend would be bringing his son. He had received the postcard a week ago; perhaps it was time he informed the girls.</p><p>He went to the kitchen where he knew he would find his eldest. "Kasumi?"</p><p>She paused in her actions. "Yes, Daddy?"</p><p>"We have visitors coming today. You will need to make dinner for two more this evening." He left the kitchen and headed up to his middle child's bedroom. He knocked lightly.</p><p>"Nabiki? We have guests coming. Please come downstairs." He moved over to his youngest girl's room and knocked.</p><p>"Akane?" Hearing no response, he opened the door. "Akane?"</p><p>Nabiki paused at the head of the stairs. "She should be back from jogging any time now. I'll get her when she comes in." She went downstairs and out the sliding doors to wait near the practice hall. Akane would head straight there after her jog. Sure enough, a short wait later, Akane entered the structure. Nabiki stopped her before she could get too wrapped up in her workout.</p><p>"You might want to get cleaned up before our guests arrive."</p><p>Akane paused and looked over. "We have guests coming?"</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Yes. And if you want to make a good impression, you'll go take a bath."</p><p>Akane thought it over, then followed Nabiki back to the house.</p><p>"<i>Fiancé</i>?"</p><p>Soun nodded. "Yes. My old training partner is bringing his son by today. If one of you were to marry him and carry on the school, the Tendo family legacy would be secure."</p><p>Akane snorted, "Well, <i>that</i> was a complete waste. Skipping my workout and taking a bath for <i>nothing</i>." She stood to leave.</p><p>Soun gave her a look. "I want you all to consider this very carefully. This engagement was made on the family honor."</p><p>Akane froze. An agreement made on the family honor would not be easily broken. She decided to fall back on what she was good at - getting mad. "I'm not marrying some perverted boy! Besides, we should have a say in who we marry!"</p><p>Nabiki asked, "What do you know about this old friend's son, Daddy?"</p><p>Soun leaned back and gave the girls a sage look. "His name is Ranma, and he's been on a training trip for the last ten years."</p><p>Nabiki frowned. "And?"</p><p>Soun looked bewildered. "And what?"</p><p>Akane burst out in anger, "And what is he like?"</p><p>Soun laughed nervously. "I haven't the slightest idea."</p><p>The girls stared in incomprehension at their father. Nabiki found her voice first.</p><p>"No idea?"</p><p>Soun shook his head. "I've never met the boy." He noticed the expression on Akane's face and decided that hadn't been the best response he could have made. He waved his hands placatively. "They'll be here any moment now. You can get to know each other better."</p><p>He was saved from at least a severe tongue lashing by the arrival of someone at the front gate.</p><p>"They're here!" Kasumi stood and headed for the kitchen. It was her place as hostess to provide refreshments.</p><p>Nabiki stayed at the table while Akane followed her father to the main entrance. Her eyes widened as the pair came running back to the living room, a giant panda close behind them. Upon reaching the living room, the panda dumped a young woman with cyan hair and a skin-tight red and black suit on the floor.</p><p>Nabiki asked of no one in particular, "Why did a panda bring this girl here?"</p><p>Kasumi moved in from the kitchen to check on her. "Is she all right?"</p><p>The panda held out a sign. 'He'll be fine.' It flipped the sign around. 'He always overdoes it with his ki attacks.'</p><p>Akane gawked at the display, then looked back at the girl. It was obviously a woman - the outfit left no room for doubt. "That panda may be smart enough to use signs, but it doesn't know anything about the difference between guys and girls!"</p><p>It gave her a disgusted look, then held out another sign. 'Can I get some hot water?'</p><p>Kasumi retreated back to the kitchen to reappear shortly with the kettle. Everyone stared as the panda poured it over its head and changed into a older bald man.</p><p>Soun was stunned. "Genma? If you're that panda, then..." He pointed at the girl on the floor.</p><p>Genma poured the rest of the kettle over his unconscious son. As Ranma changed back to his male form, the outfit that had covered his cursed form vanished, leaving him naked. Soun passed out, falling next to the boy on the floor. The girls just stared.</p><p>Everyone was awake and gathered around the low table. The girls sat on cushions while the guests knelt across from them. Ranma was angry at his father for leaving him naked on the living room floor; he was now dressed in a red, sleeveless Chinese shirt and black drawstring pants. The girls were all red-faced from the inadvertent display. Genma looked anything but apologetic.</p><p>Soun decided it was up to him to make the introductions. "This is my old friend and training partner."</p><p>Genma bowed. "Genma Saotome. And this is my son." He elbowed Ranma.</p><p>Ranma frowned at him, then bowed slightly. "Ranma Saotome. Sorry about this."</p><p>Kasumi looked at the pair. "How did you come to be this way?"</p><p>Genma intoned gravely, "It was at the training ground of Jusenkyo."</p><p>Soun nodded in understanding. "The legendary ground of accursed springs. Its true horror has always been shrouded in mystery."</p><p>Ranma whirled on his father. "WHAT? You <i>knew</i> the place was cursed?" He grabbed Genma by the collar, pulling him over. "What's the idea of takin' me to place like that, anyway?"</p><p>Genma grabbed Ranma's wrist, then flipped him out the sliding doors and into the koi pond. "You sound like a girl!" The girl with wild cyan hair surfaced. The look on her face told Genma, that hadn't been the brightest idea.</p><p>Ranma stalked back to the house, eyes glowing red. She was about to pound Genma when she noticed the others cringing away in apprehension. She sighed and got control back. It was just so easy to mad in this form. Her eyes stopped glowing, allowing the others to see the yellow irises and slitted pupils.</p><p>Akane rounded on her father. "I'm not marrying him! No matter <i>how</i> nice his body is!" She froze solid as she realized she'd said that last part out loud. She stood mortified as Nabiki snickered. "I - I mean, he's got to be a pervert!"</p><p>Ranma took offense. "What? How can you call me that?"</p><p>"You - you were wearing that skin-tight suit as a girl, then you were laying around our living room naked!"</p><p>"That's a <i>battle-suit</i>! And it doesn't carry over to my guy-side! It's not my fault! I was unconscious!" Ranma fumed.</p><p>Nabiki was intrigued by the remark. "A battle-suit?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Yeah. It's strong enough to handle any weapon I've come across so far." She waved at her current form as the suit appeared under her clothes. "But it's only a part of my cursed form. I can only make it appear while like this, and it disappears when I change back."</p><p>Nabiki's eyes narrowed as she schemed. "So, what else does this cursed form do?"</p><p>Ranma smirked as she considered the positive points she'd discovered so far. "Well, my ki is just incredible, and I seem to be able to use it unconsciously."</p><p>She demonstrated by using a small ki-bolt on Genma, who fell on his back, stunned. The Tendos boggled at the scorched man.</p><p>"I also seem to be able to do things unrelated to ki - like fly, or walk through walls."</p><p>The response was predictable. "You can fly?"</p><p>Ranma floated up into the air in response. "Yeah. And watch this!"</p><p>She teleported behind Genma as he was sitting up and kicked him into the koi pond.</p><p>Akane frowned at the display, then got a hungry look. "So if I jumped into this spring, I'd be able to fly and do ki-attacks?"</p><p>Ranma shook her head. "Something happened when I was cursed. The guide figured it was because Pop threw the divine object into the spring."</p><p>Akane looked skeptical. "Divine object?"</p><p>Ranma rooted through her pack. She brought a well-wrapped object over to the table. She dropped it and shook her hand. "No one can touch it. Even wrapped like that, it's still pretty bad." She unwrapped it and carefully slid a hand under the wrapping it rested on. She flipped it quickly over to her father as he came back in, water dripping from his fur.</p><p>The panda caught the flying object by reflex and immediately went into convulsions. He dropped the object as he fell unconscious.</p><p>Ranma wrapped it up once more and placed it back into her pack. She brought back an old scroll. "Pop woulda sold it by now except for that. But anyway, the pool no longer seems to be cursed, so the guide let me have the thing along with this scroll in case it helps me find a cure."</p><p>Akane frowned. "Well, what does it say?"</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Beats me. I can't read Chinese."</p><p>Akane rolled her eyes and snatched the scroll from the girl's hand. She perused the scroll for a minute as Ranma and Nabiki looked over her shoulder.</p><p>Nabiki frowned. "So what's it say?"</p><p>Akane looked thoughtful. "It's an older form of Chinese."</p><p>Ranma gave her a disgusted look. "So you can't read it either."</p><p>She glared up at Ranma. "I didn't say that!" She pointed at one passage. "The night sky did turn to day as the demon made its way from the pit. The warrior of Heaven did appear and give battle with the forces of light-" She paused a moment. "Or is that 'with a force of light'... the latter." She continued reading the story until the last passage, "... then did the warrior return to Heaven, departing into the rising sun."</p><p>Nabiki thought back over the story. "Seems that this 'heavenly warrior' went east when he left Jusenkyo. I don't know - it doesn't look like you have all that much to go on."</p><p>Ranma slumped her shoulders.</p><p>Nabiki grinned. "For a price, I could try to find some info on this 'divine object' and some of the drawings in the scroll."</p><p>Ranma thought it over. He really didn't have much choice at the moment.</p><p>Genma, human once more, popped up behind Ranma. "So, boy. Who are you going to pick?"</p><p>His chain of thought broken, Ranma gave him a puzzled look. "Huh?"</p><p>Soun popped up behind Nabiki. He gestured towards Kasumi. "This is my oldest daughter, Kasumi. She's nineteen." He patted Nabiki on the shoulder. "My middle daughter, Nabiki. Seventeen." He waved at Akane. "My youngest, Akane. She's sixteen. Pick one and she'll be your fiancée."</p><p>Ranma rolled her eyes. "<i>This</i> again! I ain't marryin' no one!" She held her arms out as she displayed her current form. "If you hadn't noticed, I have a little problem I need to deal with first!"</p><p>Genma put on a look of determination. "This is for the family honor, boy! You <i>will</i> marry one of Soun's daughters!"</p><p>Akane glared daggers at Ranma. "Like we'd marry <i>you</i> in the first place!"</p><p>Ranma smirked at the angry girl. "You're just jealous!"</p><p>Akane snarled in her face, "WHAT?"</p><p>"Well, you're stuck in that scrawny underdeveloped body, while <i>I</i> got all these cool powers!"</p><p>"THAT'S IT!" Akane grabbed the table and swung it.</p><p>Ranma teleported just as the table would have connected. She reappeared across the room, pulled down one eyelid, and stuck out her tongue. "Nya! Too slow!"</p><p>Akane chased him out of the house with a roar. The pair could be seen briefly as they circled the house, Akane swinging the table and Ranma floating just out of range.</p><p>Nabiki cleared her throat. "So we are all agreed? <i>Akane</i> will be Ranma's fiancée."</p><p>Genma and Soun linked arms and started dancing around. "The houses will be joined! Oh, what a grand day it is!"</p><p>They failed to see Ranma teleport into the living room, or the glare she shot the pair. She waited for Akane to come storming in.</p><p>Ranma moved in front of the celebrating duo and taunted Akane in a lilting voice, "Over here little girl!"</p><p>With a cry of frustration, Akane brought the table down in a fearful blow, only to have Ranma phase through it. The table connected solidly with Genma and Soun, smashing them to the floor, unconscious.</p><p>Nabiki moved up next to her flabbergasted sister. "Now <i>that</i> they had coming!"</p><p>Late that evening, Kasumi found Ranma up in the guest room laying out one of the futons.</p><p>She pressed a rinse bucket with bath supplies into the girl's hands. "You need to go bathe, Ranma."</p><p>Ranma yawned. "Yeah, I guess."</p><p>Kasumi watched in amazement as Ranma simply phased through the floor.</p><p>Ranma floated through the kitchen wall on her way to the bathroom. She never noticed the bathroom door, or the occupied sign on it as she phased through the wall into the outer bath. Her battle-suit blinked out of existence, leaving her unclothed.</p><p>Akane picked up her bath supplies as she turned to leave the inner bath - just as Ranma phased through the door.</p><p>Ranma <i>did</i> notice as Akane blew her top. "YOU - YOU PERVERT!" The slap rang through the house.</p><p>Katsuhito frowned. Ryoko kept appearing and disappearing. From his memories of seven hundred years ago, this meant that someone was cursed. Even when Ryoko couldn't be sensed, the master key remained; whoever was cursed had it with them. It was time he headed for Tokyo.</p><p>Inside the Juraian environment module, systems stirred as Ryu-Oh processed the information it received from the other royal trees. A course change was instituted. Upon arrival at the new destination, the guardians were activated. They reviewed the data and concurred. A small chamber in the front of the royal tree opened as Ryu-Oh let the internal stasis field drop. Crown Princess Ayeka walked out into the control center of her ship.</p><p>"Why have I been awakened? Has my brother been located?"</p><p>"No, Princess Ayeka. It is the space pirate Ryoko - she has been detected on colonized planet 0315, Earth." A blue planet covered in swirling white clouds filled the display. "Yosho was in pursuit of Ryoko, so it follows that where Ryoko is, Yosho may be nearby."</p><p>Ayeka observed the planet for a moment. "We must capture that woman and Ryo-Ohki, and return them for trial on Jurai. Descend and prepare to capture her." She continued to herself, "She is our only lead. I will <i>make</i> her tell us where Yosho is!"</p><p>"School?" Ranma paused while eating breakfast.</p><p>Genma nodded. "Yes. We will be here for quite some time, so you will attend school with Nabiki and Akane."</p><p>Ranma frowned. School had always been a bore. He also felt this was some scheme by the fathers to get him closer to his "fiancée."</p><p>"I don't have any supplies -" He was cut-off as his father tossed him a book-bag.</p><p>"Now hurry up! You don't want to be late for your first day of school."</p><p>Nabiki paused before she left the house. "Ranma? Bring that divine object. I may want to study it more at the school."</p><p>Akane looked up from breakfast. "Hey! Wait up!"</p><p>Nabiki smirked. "You need to walk your fiancé to school." She left the house, leaving Akane fuming.</p><p>Ranma walked along the top of the fence as Akane stomped along the sidewalk. She would occasionally shoot him angry glares. Ranma pretended not to notice.</p><p>Akane finally had to ask. "Why are you walking on top of the fence?"</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Balance practice. Not that I need it. It's just been pounded into me for so long to make everything into practice that I just do it out of habit."</p><p>"Well, you look weird! Get down here!"</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes, then hopped down. An old lady casting water in an old water ritual to drive off demons wound up doing just the opposite. Ranma sighed as he grew slightly and swelled at the hips and chest. She glared at the old woman and continued down the street.</p><p>Akane blinked at the transformation. "Don't you want to change back?"</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "I can get some hot water at the school. It's not like this form's too bad. I might be a girl, but at least I'm not weak like -" She bit off the rest of her comment with a glance at Akane.</p><p>Akane was gritting her teeth. "Like who?"</p><p>Ranma laughed nervously. "Look at the time! We'd better hurry or we'll be late!"</p><p>Akane shoved a finger into Ranma's chest. "Look! When we get to school, I don't know you, and you don't know me! Got it?"</p><p>Ranma nodded, "Sure, anything you say." As Akane turned around and continued toward the school, Ranma rolled her eyes.</p><p>As they neared the school, Akane got more and more agitated. She charged the last block to the school gates yelling, "I HATE BOYS!"</p><p>Ranma phased through the boundary wall and stopped in shock. Akane was fighting more than thirty boys dressed in a variety of sports uniforms.</p><p>"Ranma! Get inside!"</p><p>Ranma looked up at the school where Nabiki had called to her from the second story. She floated up to the window, ignoring the shocked looks on Nabiki's classmates. "What's all that about?" She hooked a thumb back at the courtyard.</p><p>Nabiki waved negligently. "They're just fighting her for a date. She does this every morning."</p><p>Ranma looked back where Akane was knocking out a sumo wrestler. "Really? Every morning?"</p><p>Nabiki frowned. "Don't think about interfering. Akane would probably take it out on you instead of them. Besides, she can handle them. <i>You</i> need to go find some hot water, unless you intend to go to class like that?"</p><p>Ranma looked down at herself. "Oh, right. See you 'round." She dropped down a floor and phased through the wall into the school to find some hot water.</p><p>Akane sat fuming in her seat in class 1-F. How dare Ranma ignore her fight this morning! Apparently, he thought the fight beneath his notice!</p><p>Ranma stood in front of the class waiting for the teacher's introduction. Interestingly enough, most of the talk this morning was not about the new boy, or about Akane's morning battle. It was about the strange flying girl who had vanished in one of the boy's lavatories. The homeroom teacher rapped on his desk for attention.</p><p>"We have a new student today. He has recently returned from a trip to China." He turned to Ranma. "Please introduce yourself."</p><p>Ranma bowed. "Ranma Saotome of the Saotome School of Indiscriminate Grappling."</p><p>Everyone blinked once, then returned to gossiping about the mystery girl.</p><p>"I heard she's a ghost!"</p><p>"She was talking to Nabiki."</p><p>"I heard Nabiki summoned her from the nether world in a secret midnight mass!"</p><p>A booming voice from outside drowned out all the speculation. "RYOKO! COME ON OUT! I KNOW YOU ARE IN THERE! YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME!"</p><p>Everyone crowded over to the windows. A large, wooden space ship hovered above the school.</p><p>"Who's Ryoko?"</p><p>"Maybe they think this is Tomobiki."</p><p>"That was a girl's voice, wasn't it?"</p><p>"Think she's after a cute, human boyfriend like that alien over at Tomobiki?"</p><p>"Idiot! Ryoko is a <i>girl's</i> name! She's obviously after a cute, human <i>girlfriend</i>!"</p><p>The boys in the class started drooling at the image that invoked.</p><p>Ayeka watched the viewscreen. Nothing... the school sat peacefully. She frowned. "Are you sure this thing is on?"</p><p>One of her guardians answered. "Yes, your Highness."</p><p>"Then why hasn't she appeared? Are you sure she is here?"</p><p>"Energy patterns matching Ryoko are confirmed, one hundred percent certainty -"</p><p>She shook her head. "Never mind. Fire a warning shot nearby."</p><p>A flash of light appeared over the soccer field. A shock wave spread from the blast point, shattering every window within a three kilometer radius.</p><p>There were a few screams as the students were tossed to the floor by the blast amidst the broken glass.</p><p>"Guess she's not looking for a girlfriend after all!"</p><p>Ranma lightly brushed some glass off his pants. "I'd hate to be this Ryoko character."</p><p>Several students nodded in agreement.</p><p>Akane rolled her eyes, then grabbed Ranma's collar and pulled his to one side of the room.</p><p>She hissed in his ear. "Don't you think that it's a little too coincidental that this - person - shows up here right after you?"</p><p>Ranma looked shocked. "You don't think she's after me, do you?"</p><p>"Well, add it up! Your cursed form is pretty alien, they came <i>here</i> where you are, and that ship appears to be wooden, <i>just</i> like the one in the scroll!"</p><p>Ranma forgot to keep his voice down. "You think some <i>heavenly warrior</i> has come to chop up my cursed form?"</p><p>Akane waved frantically. "Keep your voice down!" She looked around, then decided to take advantage of the chaos. She dragged Ranma out of the classroom after grabbing one of the water buckets used to punish tardy students.</p><p>Ranma noticed the bucket. "What's that for?"</p><p>Akane dumped it on him. "Go outside and see what happens!"</p><p>"WHAT?" Ranma put her hands on her hips. "You just want me to go out there and get <i>shot</i> so you don't have to marry me!"</p><p>Akane tried to look innocent. "That never crossed my mind." She pushed Ranma toward the wall. "You're supposed to be the big hero, so go out there before they decide the rest of us are expendable!"</p><p>Ranma looked shocked again. "You don't think they'd kill innocent people just to get me - er, my cursed form do you?"</p><p>Akane frowned. "That's just it - we don't know!"</p><p>Ranma thought it over. "Well, it's a martial artist's responsibility to protect the weak..." She pulled away from Akane and phased her head through the wall.</p><p>Ayeka watched the display closely. A head covered with wild cyan hair pulled back in a ponytail appeared through the wall. "<i>There</i>! Azaka! Kamidake! Go now! Capture her!"</p><p>Ranma had just pulled her head back through the wall as a large wooden cylinder appeared in the hall. "What the hell is that thing?"</p><p>She heard Akane cry out, "Ranma! Behind you!"</p><p>She turned her head to see another floating just behind her. She lost consciousness as she was absorbed into the body of the thing.</p><p><i>End Chapter 2</i></p><p>More Author's Notes: Akane reading Chinese seems implied by certain panels of the manga. It's no big deal for an alternative universe story anyway. Akane is full of little talents that people never notice because they don't relate to martial arts or her domestic skills. Ranma isn't quite as upset at having this particular cursed form because it comes with a number of cool powers, but he's learning about the downside.
