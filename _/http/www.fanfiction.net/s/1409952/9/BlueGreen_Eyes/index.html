</div>They walked in silence towards Furinkan High. Hinako would glance to her side every other step, staring at Ranma's resolute expression. Her attempts that morning to have Ranma stay at the house were all in vain, the pigtailed man stubbornly refused to let her out of his sight. "Not with him out there." He said with finality.<p>The teacher found little to argue against that. In the end she accepted Ranma's company, even if she knew what it meant. *Wonder how long it'll take for Akane to find out.* She definitely wasn't looking forward to the inevitable confrontation.<p>A few steps behind walked Aeris, glaring daggers at Ranma's back. *You're going to pay for this, bro.* She was wearing a school fuku and still wondered why the hell Hinako would have one if she was a teacher, not a student. The worst part was how it fit. It was several sizes too small. She didn't mind the short skirt or the fact that she had to let the top two buttons of the shirt undone, it was the way it restricted her movement.<p>"Ranma..." Hinako started to say but trailed off. She wanted to talk to him about what she read in that document the previous evening, but she didn't know what to say.<p>The pigtailed man turned to her with a curious expression on his face. "Yes?"<p>The teacher sighed and turned her eyes forward again. "Nothing."<p>Ranma knew what troubled Hinako, but he had to wait for her to assimilate what she read.<p>"Why do I have to go to school again?" Aeris asked irritably as she trailed after the two.<p>Hinako sighed but inwardly thanked the chance to make some conversation that didn't involve the report. "I told you already, Aeris. You need an education even if you're not in your world."<p>"That and the fact we need to stick together." Ranma said seriously.<p>"Right." Aeris grumbled as she continued to walk. There was little she could say to argue against that.<p>Pretty soon they reached the gates of Furinkan High. Hinako was glad they arrived early to get Aeris registered and that way they could avoid a confrontation with Akane. The Tendo heir always arrived five minutes before the bell, just with enough time to fight off the horde of boys. Hinako shook her head when she saw several boys already getting ready. They were giving practice swings with various sorts of sports equipment or, in the case of the judo club, stretching and generally warming up.<p>Aeris looked on in confusion. *What's going on?* She didn't think schools would be so different here.<p>Ranma remained in full alert the entire time. His eyes were studying everything around him without rest. Unlike the past couple of weeks, now the pigtailed man was in his element. Battle. All his personal problems were forgotten as he took in his surroundings. Finding strategically defensive positions, possible advantages in the terrain, obstacles, escape routes and many more. He processed all of this as he continued taking information in.<p>-<p>The students stopped their preparations to look at Hinako as she walked inside the school grounds. Regardless of the fear she caused in them they couldn't stop giving the teacher appreciative looks. She was the hottest woman they had seen, and her attitude just added to the appeal. Many were the rumors going around about the teacher, and more than one student had proclaimed to make her his. Of course none of them had the courage to actually go through with the claims, but fantasizing about it was usual for the male population of Furinkan High.<p>Today she was dressed in a more conservative way, something that had been happening more and more since she could retain her adult form. The boys groaned but either way watched her as she entered the school. They blinked their eyes when they noticed Hinako didn't come alone this morning.<p>The first thing they noticed depended on their gender.<p>The boys' sights were instantly on the girl with the school uniform. Her long brown hair and killer figure had more than one of them drooling unashamedly.<p>While this happened the girls' attention turned to the tall young man. He had his black hair tied back in a pigtail. He wore almost pure black, or at least that's what they could see under his long trench coat. There was a certain something about him that made them all interested.<p>One of them, though, was not expecting to see that man around. *What is he doing here?* Nabiki thought from her place on the third floor as she looked out the window. After yesterday's events it was a miracle she could get up so early to place the usual betting pools for the morning fight. Even Kasumi was shocked stupid when the events in the dojo took place.<p>But right now there were more pressing matters to attend than Akane's new rival. If her little sister came to school and found Ranma around things could get ugly real fast. She had to find a way to get Ranma out of here as soon as possible.<p>"PEASANT! HOW DARE YOU SHOW YOUR FACE HERE?" A bellow from outside was heard.<p>Nabiki groaned audibly, surprising many of her subordinates. *Damn! Forgot about Kuno.* She was more angry at herself than anything else.<p>-<p>"What's your problem?" Aeris demanded as she stood in front of Ranma in a defensive position. After the guy caught sight of them he took out a wooden sword and charged the pigtailed man, shouting about some nonsense she didn't quite get.<p>Ranma stared at the guy in the kendo outfit in confusion. *Do I know this guy? He does look somewhat familiar.*<p>"Kuno-san!" Hinako reprimanded with as much authority as she could place in her voice. *There goes our chance at avoiding a fight.* She lamented to herself. If they didn't get this confrontation over with fast then Akane would arrive to catch sight of Ranma. She also realized she was probably going to be transferred after this was over. She'd been warned by the other teachers of what always happened to the ones that tried to discipline Tatewaki. *And I really liked my apartment too.*<p>Kuno ignored the teacher and regarded the girl standing in front of his intended target. "What is this?" He demanded vehemently pointing his bokken at Ranma's face. "Not only do you attack fair maidens like the angel that is Tendo Akane's sister. Now you hide behind a lovely flower instead of facing the wrath of the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High." The skies were illuminated by lightning that dramatically made its appearance. Kuno then raised his bokken to the heavens. "Anyone that wants to challenge the fierce tigress Tendo Akane will have to deal with this vile demon first. So say I, the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High."<p>Hinako's eyes widened when she saw most of the boys in the yard glare at Ranma and start to advance on him, weapons at the ready. She hadn't realized just how bad the situation was. Even if she was a teacher in the school she wasn't aware of the gossiping going around. Even Nabiki hadn't been able to stop Akane and Kuno from painting Ranma as a demon from the depths of hell.<p>Worst of all was the fact that everybody believed Ranma attacked Kasumi. *I don't care about what happened yesterday, Kasumi. You're telling the truth today.* Nabiki thought as she ran down the stairs as fast as she could.<p>Aeris cursed under her breath. *Great! This is all we need.* The last time a mob attacked Ranma he was banished, and only because her parents asked for him not to be executed.<p>Hinako was startled when she saw Ranma reach into his trench coat with a cold look in his eyes. He was wearing that particular piece of clothing so he could hide his sword. "Ranma, wait." She pleaded as he took the sword out and started unsheathing it.<p>All but Kuno stopped in their attempt to attack Ranma when they saw the steel. Many gulped and took a step back. The katana was huge. Easily as long as any of them was tall.<p>"Aeris..." Ranma whispered as he continued to glare, his katana now in his hand and the sheath on the floor.<p>"Bro?" Aeris asked a little nervously. Ranma's voice was cold. He was in one of his battle moods.<p>"Get everyone out of here. Now." The pigtailed man commanded and rushed forward.<p>The boys all jumped back, startled by the sudden movement.<p>"Ranma, no!" Hinako cried as she saw Ranma rushing towards Kuno, who was the only student not taken aback by Ranma's sudden move.<p>Aeris, having fought alongside Ranma and her parents since she was old enough, knew how to read his actions perfectly. Knowing that she'd just be wasting her breath if she tried to get everyone out of the school grounds she ran after Ranma, intent on following his orders. Not that she liked being ordered around, of course, but she'd learned to go with her brother's lead.<p>-<p>Nabiki ran towards the door just in time to see Kuno raise his bokken over his head to strike, Ranma running towards him holding the katana in one hand. She didn't even get a chance to go out and cry for them to stop, but not because they met already.<p>Nabiki's world turned dark just as Kuno started his downward slash.<p>-<p>Kuno struck down with all his might, intent on ridding the world of Ranma's foul presence. Even if he wielded a wooden sword he was skilled enough to cut through solid rock with it. He'd never attacked another human being with the intent to kill, and in his mind he still wasn't. The pigtailed demon in front of him was only human in appearance. Its true nature was as foul as it could be.<p>Ranma's eyes were focused on Kuno's as the bokken lowered towards his head. In that brief moment, an instant really, the pigtailed man's blue-green orbs conveyed a message. Even Kuno, who lived in a world created by his own mind, could understand that message. It didn't carry any words, for it couldn't be expressed in words. It was a lot more primal. It was a feeling buried deep within the human mind.<p>Kuno Tatewaki finished his strike because he was already committed to it, for he found himself frozen in place. His wooden sword hit Ranma's forearm and broke apart, pretty much like Kuno's resolve did.<p>The others could see the pigtailed man raise an arm at the last possible moment, blocking Kuno's bokken with his left forearm. The wooden sword was broken in two, shocking everyone present since they'd seen what Kuno could actually do with his weapon. In another instant Kuno found himself casually backhanded like a molesting fly.<p>Hinako's blood turned cold when she saw Ranma dispatch Kuno. She half- expected for the pigtailed man to cut Kuno in half with his katana, but found herself blinking when it was obvious the pigtailed man had just shoved Kuno out of the way to continue running towards the school building.<p>No one noticed Kuno land a dozen feet away, completely unconscious. Their attention was focused on Ranma as he rushed to the school and, upon reaching it, broke down the closed doors to rush down a corridor.<p>Aeris stopped shortly before reaching the school and turned to see the students staring stupidly in her direction. She frowned at what she was about to do but knew it was necessary. With a thought she focused her energy through her left glove in a practiced pattern.<p>Hinako was still confused when she noticed Aeris pointing her hand at the ground before the students and start to glow a faint green, just like Ranma did before. Her eyes widened when fire erupted from the floor. *What is she doing?* She thought in alarm as the students all cried out in fright and rushed out of the school yard, making it difficult to advance towards the school to stop the girl.<p>-<p>Ranma was running down the halls and climbing up stairs as fast as he could. *Where the hell did he find it?* He thought as he ran into a locked door. He pushed it open, ripping it off its hinges, and noticed a last climb of stairs leading to the roof.<p>-<p>"What are you doing?" Hinako demanded with a frown as the fire died down. She ran up to Aeris, who was looking around to see if there were anymore students still inside.<p>Finding that the only one left was Kuno, and he was unconscious far enough from the school building, she turned and started running to follow Ranma. As she ran she answered the teacher, who was keeping pace with her. "Something's here. Zack went after it." She was just finished saying those words when they entered the school and stopped on their tracks.<p>"Oh no!" Hinako cried out when she saw Tendo Nabiki's unconscious body on the floor, a growing pool of blood under her.<p>Aeris cursed when she saw two more students, in pretty much the same shape, further down the corridor. "Get help for them. I'm going after Zack."<p>"Wait! I can't heal yet."<p>Aeris shook her head. "If we don't help Zack you can kiss the world goodbye." With that she rushed after her brother, following the path of bodies and blood.<p>The teacher cursed and rushed off to the closest phone. After that she went back to Nabiki and the other students she could see and did her best to stop the bleeding.<p>-<p>Ranma was standing on the roof openly glaring at what appeared to be an angel. White glowing wings protruded from the woman's back. Her beautiful features, framed by locks of curly blonde hair, had a serene smile enhancing the being's beauty. Leather body armor covered her sensual curves like a second skin. As she floated there the only sign of the being's true nature was the blood dripping from the western sword she held on her right hand.<p>The pigtailed man didn't utter a single word. Within a second he had already covered the distance between them and was swinging his katana. The angel, for her part, was blocking as best as she could. Her arms threatened to buckle under the constant pressure, but not for that did her smile leave her face.<p>The fight didn't last long. As fast and strong as the being was, Ranma was stronger and more skilled.<p>-<p>Kuno opened his eyes slowly and had trouble focusing them, since the world was stubbornly spinning around. The sound of clashing swords reached his ears and he concentrated further.<p>After a couple of minutes he could see clearly, and the sight made his blood boil. *That demon!* He thought in alarm at the sight of a goddess, for a being of such beauty and purity could be nothing less, attempting to fight off the accursed Ranma.<p>He tried to sit up and, for his efforts, only managed to make the world spin as nausea filled him. His vision started to darken and he wished it would've happened sooner, for the last thing he saw before unconsciousness claimed him again was the head of the lovely goddess leave her shoulders in an explosion of blood.<p>-<p>Aeris arrived to the roof just in time to see Ranma behead the angel- looking monster. She looked all around and sighed in relief when she noticed 'he' wasn't around. "Bro?" She hesitantly asked as she approached the pigtailed man.<p>Ranma kept staring at the corpse, even as it slowly started to shrink. Aeris' eyes widened when she saw this, and they took nearly her entire face when she saw the body transform itself into some kind of tentacle.<p>He silently crushed it with his booted foot and walked back into the building.<p>The girl stood there for a moment longer, the implications of this latest discovery going through her head and making her shiver.<p>-<p>Hinako was tending to one of the wounded students when she felt a hand take a hold of her shoulder. She turned with a start and found herself looking at Ranma. "What happened?"<p>Ranma knelt next to Hinako and placed his hands on the unconscious student. He glowed green for a moment and the teacher could see the girl's wounds healing incredibly fast. They didn't even leave scars. "We'll take care of the wounded and get out of here." The pigtailed man said as he stood up and walked over to another student.<p>"What? But we need to tell the police what happened here." Hinako protested as she rushed after Ranma.<p>"You think they'll believe what happened?" The pigtailed man asked in a disbelieving tone of voice.<p>Hinako, for the first time that day, smiled and winked at Ranma. "You'd be surprised. This is Nerima we're one, you know?"<p>Just then Aeris rushed in to help heal the wounded.<p>-<p>"Akane-chan, you really shouldn't attack a guest like that." Kasumi reprimanded as she placed a wet cloth on her sister's forehead. "You missed school and I must say it is quite impolite."<p>Akane grimaced. "She started it, Kasumi. If she kept her hands to herself instead of trying to rape my boyfriend..."<p>Kasumi, however, would have none of it. "Akane-chan, there are better ways to deal with a problem than trying to beat it down." *Particularly if the problem can effortlessly beat 'you' down.* She added to herself, knowing saying that would only make Akane even more stubborn on beating their new guest after yesterday night's events.<p>The youngest Tendo sighed and closed her eyes to sleep. She wasn't done with that hussy, but for now she should better rest to regain her strength. Ryoga was lost again, anyway.<p>Kasumi sighed. *At least what happened yesterday stopped us from speaking about that day.* She was really depressed over not clearing everything. Ranma would suffer because of it. But she'd already chosen. As much as she wanted for everyone to know the truth she didn't want to have her family suffer anymore. It was probably one of the hardest choices she'd made; she cared for both parts involved.<p>She idly wondered what the sirens in the distance meant, but let it go. Hopefully it wasn't anything serious.<p>-<p>Nabiki groaned as she stood up after the police officer was finished questioning her. Even if her wound was healed, and everybody was wondering just how that was possible, she was still sore as hell. She felt as if she'd strained every single muscle on her lower back. In her current state she didn't see the importance of her statement. 'All I saw was Ranma and Kuno facing off and about to strike each other when I was stabbed in the back.'<p>Even if Nabiki didn't see the importance of said statement, nor did any of the other students and teachers, it was very important for a certain pigtailed man that was now sitting under custody in a classroom after giving his statement.<p>Aeris was being held in another classroom for attacking the students. Of course, since she was underage and no one was hurt she'd be set free. It amazed her that in such a peaceful and normal world a place like Nerima, where people throwing around fire were considered normal, existed.<p>Hinako, on the other hand, was trying to convince the police both Ranma and Aeris actually defended the students from the monster, which vanished after being defeated. "I'm telling you, officer. Ranma and Aeris protected everyone. They even healed the injured students."<p>The officer, who coincidentally was the same one they met in the previous two incidents they were involved in, nodded. "I don't doubt your word, Ninomiya-sensei. But this is normal procedure. We have to hold your boyfriend and that young lady in custody until everything is cleared up."<p>Hinako blinked at the officer's words and then a slight blush colored her cheeks.<p>The man missed the blush and tried to reassure the woman. "Don't worry. The most likely outcome will be for them to be set free." He smirked. "What we wouldn't give to have Ranma-san working with us. Nerima is a dangerous place and he knows how to handle himself. Just be patient. A couple of hours more and you'll be all going back home."<p>Hinako smiled slightly and nodded to the officer before he went over to talk to his superior, who was just now arriving. The teacher sighed as they exchanged a few words and another woman arrived. She was slightly surprised when both police officers bowed to said woman respectfully. After five minutes the woman was led to the classroom currently holding Ranma.<p>Hinako couldn't help but be curious, but was distracted as Aeris walked down the hall towards her. It seemed like the teenager was finally released. Now they only had to wait for Ranma.<p>-<p>Ranma sat at the teacher's desk with his arms crossed over his chest. Now that the fight was over he was starting to calm down. With his battle senses becoming dormant normal thoughts were starting to plague him. The way the students were all about to attack him that morning reminded him of the past. He was actually thankful for the attack on the school. That gave him a focus to ignore what was going on before.<p>Now that he could think clearly he understood there was no possible way for him to come back to this school. Kuno and Akane, not to mention half the school body, would be on his case regardless of what he did. As bothersome as they were he didn't want to kill them, which was the inevitable conclusion should a serious confrontation occur.<p>*But what to do? I can't leave Hinako alone.* He thought to himself and tried to find a solution to the dilemma.<p>He was taken out of his thoughts when the door opened and in walked a black- haired woman dressed in a dark blue business suit. She closed the door behind herself and nodded to him. "Ranma-san." She didn't wait for a response before walking towards the pigtailed man.<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow as he studied the woman. She seemed to be in her middle twenties and, though her figure didn't compare to Hinako's, she was attractive in more ways than one. There was something about her that was out of place, though.<p>The woman stopped when she was only two feet away from Ranma and waited patiently for him to stop studying her. *It seems like the information on him is accurate. It didn't take him more than a couple of seconds to notice.*<p>The pigtailed man stood up, towering over the woman, and glared down at her. "What are you?"<p>"I'm Hidari Kaze." She said with a smirk, not at all intimidated by the menace in his voice.<p>"'What' are you?"<p>Kaze raised an eyebrow. "Didn't even need a minute to notice, did you? I'm impressed." She casually walked over to a chair and sat down. She sensually crossed her legs, purposely giving him a good show to put him off guard, and smiled at him. "Would you share the courtesy if I answered your question?"<p>Ranma wasn't distracted by the woman's actions and his eyes continued to bore into her black orbs. "What are you talking about?"<p>"Don't play dumb with me, Ranma. I can call you Ranma, can't I?" She winked at him. "Look, we know you're not a normal human." She gave him an appreciative look. "In fact you look pretty well put together after what happened ten years ago."<p>The pigtailed man remained silent. It seemed like this woman, whoever and whatever she was, knew more about him than he himself did. At least about his existence in this world. "Hidari-san..."<p>"Call me Kaze." She interrupted him with a beaming smile.<p>Ranma nodded after a moment of silence. "Look, I don't know what you want with me. I just want to know what you are and what you are doing here."<p>Kaze laughed. "I'll tell if you tell." However, when she received no answer, she sighed. "Fine. Have it your way, Ranma." She stood up and walked over to him. She reached into her pocket and retrieved a card. "This is my personal number. I'll tell the police to let you go."<p>"What would I need your number for?" Ranma asked with a frown. "You've obviously been following me around."<p>Kaze winked seductively at him. "That's for you to call me when you want a hot date, handsome."<p>"..."<p>Kaze laughed again and opened the door. "And Ranma..." She reached outside just before casually throwing his katana at him. "... Try to stay out of trouble." With that said she was gone.<p>Ranma caught the sword one-handed with a look of surprise on his face.<p>-<p>Five minutes later Ranma, Hinako and Aeris were walking out of the school grounds. After the day's events classes were obviously cancelled.<p>The pigtailed man walked ahead, seemingly lost in thought.<p>Aeris and Hinako walked a few steps behind, quietly engaging in conversation. "He's playing with us." The teacher said with a frown. "He knew that monster would be easily defeated."<p>Aeris shook her head with a sigh. "Maybe for bro it was easy. It would've taken you and me together to defeat it, and with your limited control over the materia it would've been a close call."<p>"But..."<p>Aeris smirked. "You obviously don't understand the significance of the report. When that bastard said he was creating a weapon he was right on the money." She sobered and turned to regard Ranma's back.<p>Hinako sighed and turned to Ranma as well. "Then why waste time attacking like this?"<p>Aeris frowned. "He's weakening him."<p>"What?"<p>"That bastard knows bro can resist him with his will, even if he can only do it for a short time. He's purposely making your boyfriend suffer so he's an easier target." Aeris said.<p>Hinako was so surprised by the statement that she missed the reference to her relationship with Ranma. "But what would...?" She trailed off and remembered with horror the way everybody reacted to Ranma's presence. Students, teachers... even the police officers. They all gave Ranma a wide berth as he walked out of the school. The pigtailed man's expression to that reaction, to the fear everyone had of him, was sad. Not unlike the one he had the night she met him. "Ranma..."<p>"We have to do something before he feels it's time to strike." They turned a corner and caught sight of Hinako's apartment.<p>-<p>Nabiki frowned as she closed the gates. She walked to her house and took off her shoes to enter the building. *Damn it.* She'd caught Tofu trailing her, one of the main reasons why she didn't go directly to Hinako's place to ask what the hell happened. She didn't know what Tofu was doing following her around, but she would bet money, and a good amount of it, that if Tofu saw her with Ranma her father would be on her case again.<p>She entered the house and walked directly to the kitchen. "Hi, sis! Hi, Shampoo." She greeted the former with enthusiasm and the later with distaste. The Amazon girl was not welcome in her book. No one that destroyed Tendo property was.<p>Kasumi blinked and turned to the clock. "Nabiki-chan... you're home early."<p>Shampoo smiled at Nabiki and waved. She was having tea with Kasumi and talking to the older girl. Even if Kasumi was obviously not a fighter, and so the Amazons wouldn't respect her much, she was still the first person to be nice to the purple-haired girl during her stay in Japan.<p>Nabiki shrugged and sat down. She smiled faintly when a cup of steaming tea was placed in front of her. "Thanks." She took a sip of the tea and sighed. "Classes were cancelled today. A monster attacked and injured a lot of people."<p>"Oh my! Then those sirens..."<p>Nabiki nodded. "Afraid so, sis."<p>Shampoo blinked and looked at Nabiki's back. "What happen to sneaky girl? She no look hurt, but blood all over."<p>Kasumi was instantly on her feet and fussing over her sister, much to her embarrassment. "I'm okay, sis. Ranma-kun healed the wound." She was starting to get used to things like that around the pigtailed man, that was why it came out as casual as it did.<p>The eldest sister nodded, though it was obvious she was still worried about Nabiki's health.<p>Shampoo, however, was more interested in another thing Nabiki said. "Ranma Amazon slave, yes?" She didn't know why, but actually being on the receiving end of Kasumi's frown made her feel like the lowest of scum. "Shampoo sorry..."<p>Kasumi and Nabiki turned to Shampoo with twin looks of disapproval at the Amazon's reference to Ranma. Before they could comment on it, or even register Shampoo's apology, they were interrupted by an irritated male voice.<p>"What is this I hear about Ranma, daughters?" Soun asked as he entered the kitchen with a frown on his face, closely followed by Genma. The later man did a remarkable job of remaining solemn, contrary to his behavior the previous night when Shampoo appeared out of nowhere looking for retribution against him. When only silence answered him Soun's frown deepened. "Well? I'm expecting an answer."<p>Kasumi watched in alarm as her sister's expression turned from nervous to irritated at their father's demanding tone of voice. *Nabiki-chan...*<p>"To do what, daddy?" Nabiki demanded in a tone suspiciously similar to Soun's, mocking him. "What will you do if you find Ranma-kun?"<p>Soun glared at his daughter. "Nabiki! I am your father!"<p>"Answer the damn question!" Nabiki snapped back, surprising everyone in the room except Shampoo. The girl was staring at the middle Tendo sister and found her attitude resembled that of the Amazon warriors when they were reprimanding a male.<p>Soun continued to glare at his daughter instead of reverting to tears as was his tactic before. Since Genma arrived and Akane was trained by both masters of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts he was recovering more and more of his old self.<p>At first Nabiki and Kasumi were glad for the change, but when Soun didn't make a move to support the family they now had a bigger weight on their shoulders. Soun spent all the money Nabiki made on training equipment for Akane, while the little that remained went to feed Genma.<p>"Nabiki." Soun said menacingly. "You will give me the respect I'm due. Now answer me. Where is Ranma?"<p>Nabiki growled and Kasumi interrupted her before she could snap back at Soun. "Nabiki-chan!"<p>"Save it, sis! I'm sick and tired of this!" Nabiki retorted, shocking Kasumi, and turned back to Soun. "You want to know what happened today? Do you?" She pointed an accusing finger at Soun. "The boy you're trying to punish for something that didn't happen fought off a monster at school. If it weren't for him I'd be dead right now, together with close to twenty other people." Before anyone could talk she continued. "You want me to respect you? Do the right thing for once and apologize to him. Akane is full of it. Things didn't happen the way she..."<p>*SLAP!*<p>A wide-eyed Nabiki touched her stinging cheek with her hand.<p>Soun was breathing heavily as he lowered his hand, his face flushed with anger. "Go to your room." He commanded in a low voice. "You'll stay there until you tell me what I want to know AND you apologize to your sister."<p>When Nabiki got out of her shock, and Soun's words registered, her eyes turned cold and she stared at Soun with her Ice Queen mask firmly in place. "No." She said emotionlessly.<p>Kasumi, even if she was somewhat calm on the outside, was inwardly sobbing at the scene. This was what she'd been trying to avoid all along. A confrontation that would tear her family apart. Over the years Nabiki had been accumulating animosity towards their father. Unlike Kasumi, who was saddened by the fact that she couldn't live like a normal girl and buried her emotions to put on the cheerful smile everyone could see, Nabiki buried her anger under a thick cover of ice.<p>Kasumi broke down weeks ago, her emotions finally coming to the surface. It was now Nabiki's turn as the ice shattered.<p>"What?" Soun demanded with a frown.<p>Genma remained silent, as he'd been through the entire conversation. He knew Soun's protective instincts would come out if he acted in any way against his daughters. He didn't like the idea of Soun reprimanding Nabiki so harshly, but there was no other way. *After all, Akane is the one that matters.* He thought, knowing he had the youngest Tendo's support.<p>"You heard me. I'm not doing what you tell me to do anymore." Nabiki said, still in the same emotionless tone of voice.<p>"As long as you live under my roof you will obey me."<p>Nabiki smirked, a sight that made even Soun, who was running on rage and indignation, wince. "That's just the thing, daddy. Wake up and see things the way they are. This roof is still over our heads because of me."<p>"That's enough, Nabiki-chan." Kasumi said with as much disapproval as she could manage in her voice.<p>Nabiki nodded. "You're right on that one, sis. It's about time we all come out clean."<p>Kasumi winced when she understood what Nabiki meant. "Shampoo-chan?" The purple-haired girl turned to her with a curious look on her face. "Could you give Nabiki-chan company in her room?"<p>Shampoo nodded at the polite dismissal and turned to Nabiki, who protested almost instantly. "Kasumi..."<p>"Don't worry, Nabiki-chan." Kasumi sighed. "I'll tell them everything."<p>Nabiki nodded doubtfully and walked upstairs, closely followed by a purple- haired Amazon.<p>With great reluctance Kasumi started talking about the events that happened in the dojo that fateful day when things started to go wrong.<p>-<p>Hinako watched in awe as Aeris moved through a very intense kata in the middle of her living room. They moved the furniture to the walls to leave enough open space for the girl to train inside the house. Watching Aeris working out was a good way to distract herself from the events of the last two days. Her view of the world was completely shattered and she didn't know where she stood anymore. She was used to the weirdness, but even she was taken completely off guard by this.<p>Aeris usually didn't train for as long as she did today, but she needed the extra exercise to focus after the day's events. What Ranma told them about the woman, Kaze as she called herself, had her on edge. *As if Sephiroth having access to Jenova's body wasn't bad enough.* She mentally groused, in the process losing her concentration and her balance. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath before starting the kata anew. She was far from home, from her parents and friends, and just now she was starting to get homesick. When she first heard Sephiroth was going after Zack all she could think about was warning her big brother. Now that she was here, even if she would still do the same thing if given the choice, she was missing the feeling of having her parents around. That feeling of being safe that Ranma, even as strong as he was, didn't give her on the same degree.<p>Ranma sat on the floor, his back against the wall, and stared at the floor in silence. He wasn't thinking about Sephiroth, though. *She was genuinely interested. I could feel it. Why?* His mind was going over and over through his encounter with Hidari Kaze. Though he could tell she only met him because of her job it was obvious her interest in him after the first couple of minutes went beyond the professional level. The reason why was lost him, though he had the funny feeling it had something to do with the fact she was different too. *She didn't feel wrong, just out of place. And she could lift my sword... What is she?* He knew, somehow, that he would find the answer to that question. And maybe sooner than he expected.<p>-<p>Soun and Genma sat in front of the shogi board, yet none was paying any attention to the game. In fact they hadn't moved a piece for hours.<p>When Kasumi was finished with her tale she excused herself from the kitchen, but not fast enough to hide the tears that started to flow from her eyes. For Soun it was the first time he saw his eldest daughter cry since his wife died. Those tears cut through any anger he could have, leaving him depressed and angry at himself.<p>Genma was a man that looked down on women. That was no secret. Lately he'd made an exception and was training Akane seriously, but even then he didn't expect much of her. He just wanted a reason to stay at the Tendo Dojo, and subsequently postpone his return to his wife. Saotome Genma was a greedy man, maybe even to the point of being as evil as the master he feared, but he was still a man. Seeing the sweetest girl he'd ever known cry, and knowing he was the cause, hit him hard.<p>Finally one of them broke the silence that seemed to permeate the room, even if the sounds of exertion came from the dojo. Akane had come earlier to get today's lesson, and went to the dojo with a frown on her face when her father and Saotome-sensei told her to train by herself. "Saotome... Your son is..."<p>Genma sighed. "I know, Tendo."<p>None of them could say it out loud, but they both knew it. "What now, old friend?" Soun asked quietly.<p>The Saotome patriarch crossed his arms over his chest and frowned. "We ask the boy to return."<p>"You think he'll return after what happened?" The black-haired man asked doubtfully. "We caused him great grief."<p>"That we did... but that also means he has strong feelings for your daughter." Genma said seriously. "There's still the pledge to uphold."<p>Soun nodded slowly. "You are right, Saotome. Your son must marry one of my daughters. It's what honor demands." He hesitated for a moment. "But what if even then he doesn't want to return?"<p>"The schools 'must' be joined. The boy obviously lied when he told us he didn't remember anything." Genma's scowl deepened.<p>"If he didn't remember his fighting skills he wouldn't be able to fight a monster." Soun stated, knowing his training companion was right. "So what do we do?"<p>"First we need to find out where he is. Nabiki knows."<p>"That may be, but she won't tell us." Soun lowered his head and sighed loudly. "She's just like her mother when she gets angry. We'll be lucky if she even speaks to us." He'd recognized the similarity when he thought back to the argument. *And like a fool I fueled the fire.*<p>Genma grunted. "Maybe Kasumi knows as well."<p>Soun nodded and got even more depressed. The very mention of his daughter's name made him remember her tears. Tears he caused. It seemed like all he'd managed with his actions of late was hurt his daughters. "We'll... talk to her tomorrow."<p>The other man nodded slowly. He didn't feel like confronting Kasumi with this today either.<p>-<p>"The time is now."<p>"Gold is power."<p>"Report."<p>"He's powerful. Maybe on level 6."<p>"... Level 6? Are you certain?"<p>"Can't know for sure without fighting him."<p>"... Better not push it yet. According to the available information he's psychologically unstable."<p>"What do I tell the local authorities?"<p>"They are to ignore his existence. Should he participate in another incident like this one you're responsible of seeing that he's released."<p>"Am I to keep surveillance of him, then?"<p>"For the time being. Try to keep out of public sight."<p>"I don't need to be told that."<p>"Remember the temple incident?"<p>"That wasn't my fault! That crazy bitch was going on and on about planet destroyers!"<p>"That may be so, but it was your fault she recognized your true nature."<p>"Fine. I'll keep out of sight."<p>"Good. See to it that Ninomiya Hinako is transferred to sector 4."<p>"Are you sure? Sector 4 is very... unstable."<p>"Do it."<p>"Understood."<p>-<p>"The time is now."<p>"The crab walks sideways."<p>"Any new readings?"<p>"Whoever did this created a piece of art."<p>"Gold estimates him to be on level 6."<p>"Level 6? Are you kidding? This guy could easily beat down a level 7!"<p>"... You can't be serious!"<p>"I am. According to the readings he's still gaining in strength. If my calculations are accurate, and they always are, we have here a subject that will be able to go toe to toe with Gold. Even my daughter will be hard pressed to stay alive in a fight against him."<p>"..."<p>"I thought you'd be happy to hear this..."<p>"My daughter is going to kill me when she finds out."<p>"... You haven't told her?"<p>"She thinks her husband is still taking care of him. And the worst of all is I assigned him to sector 4!"<p>"Oh boy! And we don't have enough data to confirm he won't become hostile with the locals."<p>"What do you need to make certain?"<p>"I need to get him into my lab for analysis; otherwise he's a wild card."<p>"... I didn't want it to be so soon but... time to test them."<p>"Are you sure? Testing your pupils against a level 6 would be bad enough, but against your grandson? If they mess up they'll be such a bloody mess it won't be even funny. And you haven't told them the truth about your role yet."<p>"If they can't handle this situation then it's better if they don't continue in the project and don't know anything else. Don't worry; I'll make sure all of them remain alive."<p>"I just want to make this clear. This is your responsibility."<p>"Agreed."<p>END PART 8<p>Author's notes: Hey everyone! Sorry this took so long, RL's been a real pain as of late.<p>The last couple of conversations give more than enough hints for you to know what's going on.
