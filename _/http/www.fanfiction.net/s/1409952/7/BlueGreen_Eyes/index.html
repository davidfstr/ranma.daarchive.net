</div>The girl winked at him with a smile on her face. "That's my name." She said in a sweet voice full of enthusiasm at having found him. Her green eyes were entirely focused on Ranma, who stared back still in shock.<p>As soon as she got her bearings back Hinako started studying the teenager that tackled both Ranma and herself to the ground. It was also a good distraction for she was still trying to fight down the furious blush and control her breathing. The girl that called the pigtailed man 'Zack' was probably seventeen. She had long brown hair tied back in a loose ponytail with bangs of hair over her face. With the skin-tight clothes she wore it was no problem to see the girl was very healthy, not as voluptuous as Hinako but then again the teacher had a fully matured woman's body. She wore fingerless red gloves on her hands, which matched, with her sneakers.<p>The thing that attracted Hinako's attention the most was the bracelet on the girl's left arm, though. So much like the one Ranma gave her, which explained where this young woman came from better than a thousand words. She turned to Ranma, who was still staring at the teenager but seemed to finally overcome his shock.<p>Ranma blinked again to make sure he wasn't hallucinating. It wouldn't be the first time. When the image didn't go away he realized he wasn't dreaming. "Aeris?" He asked again. "What are you doing here? How did you get here?"<p>The girl giggled at the questions asked in quick succession. It didn't escape her notice that when she tackled Zack he hugged the woman protectively, neither did she fail to notice the glance said woman gave Ranma after obviously studying her. *Such great teasing potential.* She thought as she cleared her throat and answered the questions with her own. "What? Aren't you happy to see me?" Her eyes twinkled mischievously when she saw the unconscious protectiveness in Hinako's position. Said eyes widened fractionally when she caught notice of the color of Hinako's eyes. *What the...?*<p>Ranma shook his head to clear it and managed a smile. "Of course I'm glad to see you. I was just wondering why you followed me."<p>When Aeris sobered the pigtailed man knew something was wrong. The girl rarely, if ever, stopped smiling. When she spoke her voice was dead serious. "Zack, we need to talk."<p>"Zack?" Hinako asked, speaking for the first time since Aeris found them. Her embarrassment was forgotten when she heard the name again, as well as when she saw Ranma's expression turn somber.<p>Ranma got up and offered a hand to each girl. After helping them both to their feet he started gathering Hinako's school supplies.<p>Seeing Ranma wouldn't speak another word Hinako turned to Aeris, who answered the unvoiced question. "Zack needs to get his backpack. Now. I found him because I saw his picture in the newspaper. I'm sure he saw it too."<p>Hinako was taken aback by the urgency in the girl's voice. "Who are you talking about?" She asked. Just then Ranma picked up the last of the supplies and turned to regard her.<p>He was about to answer her question when he suddenly turned to the side.<p>Aeris did so as well, having felt a chill run down her spine and dreading what she would find. Her eyes widened as she whispered something just loud enough for Hinako to hear. "No."<p>The teacher followed Ranma's gaze, and her eyes immediately caught sight of him across the street. Even if he was more than 300 feet away it was impossible not to see him.<p>His long white hair in contrast to the black leather he wore, a man in his thirties stared at them coldly through blue-green eyes that glinted with the light. Or rather stared directly at Ranma. His frame wasn't overly muscular, yet he exuded power and danger in waves that were almost physical.<p>Aeris frantically turned to the sides. To all the people enjoying the day in the park. *If a fight breaks out here all these people will die.* She thought afraid of the possibility.<p>A truck blocked their view of the man for only a second, and when it was gone revealed the man in black had vanished. Not a sign of him left.<p>Aeris started turning in all directions apprehensively, her hand unconsciously taking hold of her bracelet.<p>Hinako let go of a breath she didn't know she was holding and turned to Ranma.<p>The pigtailed man kept staring forward for a couple of seconds before turning to lock gazes with the teacher. His expression was hard, yet his voice was soft when directed at her. "Let's go."<p>-<p>Kasumi sat at the table with her father and youngest sister, who was speaking to Soun about what happened at school today, and stared at the table biting her lower lip in frustration. As much as she wanted to hide the truth it seemed like some Kami was against her.<p>"Hinako-sensei knows where to find that bastard." Akane said forcefully.<p>That was another thing. In the house it had become common for Genma, Soun and Akane to refer to Ranma as a bastard or a monster. Every time she heard those words, so full of disgust, her chest tightened. She knew it was because of her, of her unwillingness to clear things up, that they continued to behave like that.<p>Soun frowned as he heard the news his daughter brought from school. "And you say she defended him?" Seeing his youngest daughter nod his scowl deepened. "Then he somehow managed to deceive your teacher. I can hardly picture her standing by that monster's side."<p>Akane nodded, having come to the same conclusions as her father.<p>Kasumi looked in dismay at her little sister. Thankfully for her neither Soun nor Akane were paying her enough attention to notice. *Please, let it go.* She mentally pleaded, knowing going down this path would hurt a lot of people. It would hurt Ranma, who'd already been hurt and didn't deserve any of it.<p>"I want you to keep a close eye on your teacher." Soun said seriously. "It's a martial artist's duty to protect the weak." Akane smiled at her father and nodded. "Don't confront her with it. If you see Saotome's son follow him and tell us where to find him. We'll all punish him for what he did to your sister." He finished with a growl as he turned to Kasumi, who had lowered her head in shame at the last words. Both Soun and Akane took it as a sign that the memory was still too much for her, when it truth the young woman was wondering how things could get any worse.<p>-<p>They exchanged no more words in the way towards Hinako's apartment. The teacher stole glances from Ranma all the way, which only Aeris noticed since the pigtailed man was too busy studying their surroundings. He looked into every shadowed alley as if he expected for someone, or something, to jump him. The muscles in his body were tense, something she'd only seen when Ranma got angry. All she could do for now was swallow the need to ask the questions that plagued her mind. *And who is she?* She asked herself as she looked at Aeris out of the corner of her eye. All she could tell was that the girl was very fond of Ranma, a feeling he seemed to return, and that she called him Zack. That and the fact that the teenager was very attractive, something that bothered her for some reason.<p>Aeris walked next to Zack and his friend in alert. She wanted to run and get Zack's backpack, but knew that running would attract more attention to them. That was the last thing they needed.<p>They arrived to Hinako's apartment and the teacher quickly opened the door for Ranma and Aeris to rush in. After locking it behind her she walked into the living room to find Ranma already grabbing a hold of his backpack. Aeris stood to the side, her brown eyes intent on Ranma's movements. "Can you please tell me what's going on? Why are you so worried about that man?" She asked with no small amount of trepidation.<p>Aeris turned to face her with a look of apprehension. "How much do you know about what Zack is?"<p>When Ranma didn't even flinch with the question, since it reminded him of what he was, Hinako was taken aback. *It really must be serious.* She thought. "What he's told me." The teacher answered.<p>Ranma spoke before Aeris could further question Hinako. "Hinako was pulled to the planet's life stream with me, Aeris. She knows most of what there is to it."<p>"Is that even possible?" Asked a startled Aeris as she turned to Ranma, who straightened his backpack and took a hold of one of the aluminum pipes that conformed its frame. It was thick and nearly as long as he was tall. With a flick of his wrist a click was heard. The pipe then slid out of the frame. "Does she know about the project?" She asked.<p>Ranma nodded. "Yeah, it's possible. And no, she doesn't know all about the project." He answered before turning to Hinako. "As for that man, he's the influence you saw in my aura."<p>Hinako gasped. "You mean...?"<p>Aeris nodded somberly. "We're facing the only man capable of controlling Zack."<p>Ranma twisted the top of the pipe and removed it. "It doesn't matter. We can't let him control me." He took a hold of something inside the pipe and pulled it out.<p>Hinako's eyes widened when she recognized the object inside for what it was. A gigantic katana that even in its sheath looked formidable. "Ranma?" She asked uncertainly. Seeing it in the pigtailed man's hands it somehow became all the more deadly looking.<p>Ranma brushed the sweat off his forehead and turned to regard the teacher. "I have to face him. It's the only safe way to get it done with. If we wait he could attack in a moment of weakness." His eyes softened as he looked at Hinako. "He could attack you."<p>Aeris looked worriedly at the pigtailed man and stepped closer to him. "It'll have to wait, Zack. At least until tomorrow."<p>"Huh?" Ranma intelligently asked.<p>Aeris reached up and touched Ranma's forehead. "It's starting again. You'll have to wait."<p>"What's starting again?" Hinako asked worriedly as she saw Ranma curse under his breath. She copied Aeris and took a hand to Ranma's forehead. "You mean...?" She trailed off, knowing what was about to start.<p>Ranma growled and nodded, then turned to Aeris. "Speed it up."<p>Aeris looked uncertain. "Zack..."<p>Ranma gave the katana to Hinako, who took it out of reflex, and interrupted her. "You know what will happen if he comes while I'm not ready. We don't have a choice."<p>Aeris continued to hesitate. "But the risk of speeding it up..."<p>"It has to happen eventually, Aeris." Ranma said resignedly as he looked at Hinako sadly. "It doesn't matter if it happens today or in ten years, it'll eventually happen."<p>Hinako, who had been listening in shock without saying a word, protested when she understood what Ranma was talking about. "You can't do that, Ranma!"<p>"I have no choice."<p>The finality of his words killed any further protests Hinako and Aeris had. They both knew what Ranma could lose if he went ahead with this, but they also knew it was the only way available.<p>"Damn it!" Aeris cursed loudly before she started chanting.<p>Ranma's knees suddenly gave out under him as he started to feel the familiar agony of the lapses. Instead of hitting the ground hard, as he was used to, he felt a body press against his and help him to a resting position on the floor. He looked up and into Hinako's concerned blue-green eyes and offered a weak smile before he couldn't take it anymore.<p>Aeris finished her chanting and extended her hands forward, glowing a soft green. A faint red aura surrounded Ranma's body as he started roaring in pain.<p>Hinako remained sitting by his side during the entire ordeal, her hand firmly clasping his even if the touch of his skin was as hot as the last time, if not more so. Her eyes were intent on his suffering form, never wavering as if she was trying to share the burden he carried.<p>Standing to the side Aeris watched this with a look of realization on her face.<p>-<p>Two grueling hours later Hinako still sat next to Ranma, who was now sleeping soundly after the ordeal. The teacher healed her own hand shortly after Ranma fell asleep, and marveled at how easy it was once she knew the pattern.<p>Aeris left sometime before, unable to stand Ranma's cries of pain. She said something about checking the area, but the teacher wasn't really paying attention.<p>That left her alone with Ranma right now, and alone to think about the tremendous effect the pigtailed man had on her. She was convinced that going to the life stream with Ranma was the main reason for her current feelings. That and the fact that they were both very similar in many aspects.<p>And right now she was facing the possibility of losing Ranma if that other man managed to follow through with his plans. She didn't know for certain that he actually planned on controlling Ranma, but she had to be prepared for the worst.<p>The sound of the front door opening and closing brought her out of her thoughts. She took her hand to her bracelet and narrowed her eyes when she heard the soft footsteps approaching, and gave out a silent sigh of relief when she caught sight of Aeris entering the room.<p>"How is he?" The teenager asked worriedly as she approached Ranma's sleeping form.<p>Hinako turned down to Ranma and smiled sadly. "He didn't go all the way, but he lost a lot more than last time." She turned to regard Aeris. "It's as he said. It'll eventually happen."<p>The girl sighed and nodded. She slumped on a couch and rubbed the bridge of her nose. "I couldn't find him. Either he didn't follow us or he's waiting for a better chance."<p>Hinako caressed Ranma's cheek and stood up. She stretched her back and tried to get the feeling back into her legs. "So what's your story?" She asked looking directly at her newest guest.<p>Aeris didn't look up as she answered, mostly to hide her wicked grin. "Don't worry, I'm not here to take your lover away."<p>"What?" Hinako asked in confusion before Aeris' words set in. She blushed furiously and sputtered some excuses for a few minutes before catching sight of Aeris' face.<p>Still heavily blushing the teacher glared at the giggling teen. "That wasn't funny."<p>Aeris giggled even harder at the indignant tone of voice the woman used. "It was for me."<p>Hinako's eyebrow started to twitch as her guest continued to laugh at her expense. What angered her the most was her own embarrassment, not Aeris' fun. She would really like to still have her chi abilities right now, they couldn't really hurt someone, something that might happen if she used her new ones.<p>Aeris managed to get her mirth under control and looked up at the still angry Hinako. "I come from the other world, but I guess you already knew that." Seeing Hinako nod she continued. "I grew up with Zack after my parents took him in."<p>The teacher realized then just who Aeris was. "So you're Ranma's sister?"<p>Aeris frowned a little. "Why do you insist on calling him Ranma?"<p>Hinako stretched and sat down on a chair. "Because that's his real name. His father found him sometime after he returned to our world." With that she started explaining what she knew of Ranma since he returned.<p>-<p>Nabiki entered her room and was slightly surprised to find her oldest sister waiting for her. "Kasumi?" She asked as she closed the door behind her. "What's wrong?" She asked a little worriedly as she sat on the bed next to Kasumi.<p>Kasumi looked at her sister and bit her lower lip. "Nabiki-chan, father spoke to Tofu-sensei again today."<p>It immediately dawned on Nabiki what Kasumi was talking about. She'd been lucky not to run into her father or Akane, since they were both in the dojo with Genma, before talking to Kasumi. "How bad?" The younger girl asked.<p>Kasumi closed her eyes and sighed. "Father is convinced Ranma-kun is somehow forcing you to help him." She paused and frowned. "Akane-chan wanted to get his location... even if she had to beat it out of you."<p>Nabiki nodded. *No great surprise there.* She thought sullenly. *Violence first, questions later.* "So what now?" She asked her eldest sister, who opened her eyes and looked at her helplessly.<p>"I was hoping you could come up with something." Kasumi really thought about it, but came up with nothing.<p>Nabiki crossed her arms over her chest. "I'm sorry, Kasumi. There's nothing I can do."<p>"Nabiki-chan!"<p>The middle Tendo sister shook her head vehemently. "My hands are tied, remember? You made me promise not to tell daddy the truth of what happened in the dojo."<p>Kasumi deflated at that and looked helplessly at the floor. "Isn't there another way?"<p>"Maybe." Nabiki didn't look convinced of that. "But it would be only a temporary solution. You can't expect to solve this mess with more lies."<p>"Nabiki-chan! I never lied." Kasumi protested.<p>The younger girl narrowed her eyes. "Your silence was even worse than lying." Not letting her sister get a word edgewise she continued with the accusation. "Face it, sis. By not clearing the whole mess you're responsible for daddy's actions. If he gets himself killed over this it'll be all your fault." She accused, careful to keep the volume of her voice low enough not to be heard from the dojo. She knew accusing her sister in such a way was uncalled for, but her own fear that Soun might indeed find that fate at Ranma's hands overrode all others for the moment.<p>"Nabiki-chan!" Kasumi was livid. "Ranma-kun would never..."<p>"Remember that day, sis?" Nabiki interrupted. "I found out those idiots tried to molest two other women a few days ago. You know what happened? Ranma-kun happened to be around and he rescued them."<p>"What does that have to do with father?" Kasumi asked, her eyes burning with hurt that Nabiki would bring that up, as well as a sense of pride when hearing of Ranma's actions.<p>Nabiki's expression turned even colder. "One of them is in a coma. The others were severely injured. The only reason Ranma-kun isn't in jail is because the witnesses said it was clear self defense and that asshole was wanted for rape."<p>"Oh." Kasumi said, suddenly finding her own hands very interesting to look at.<p>Nabiki took a deep breath to control herself. "I'm sorry, sis. But you saw how unstable Ranma-kun is. I don't want to think what will happen if daddy or Akane attack him and he fights back."<p>Looking at it that way Kasumi did have to admit it was a very unnerving scenario. She sighed and looked at her sister, who was expectantly waiting for her answer. "Very well, Nabiki-chan. Let's..."<p>*CRASH!*<p>"MALE DIE!"<p>"GET AWAY FROM HIM!"<p>*CRASH!*<p>"AKANE!"<p>Nabiki was instantly on her feet. "That came from the dojo!" She cried before running out of her room and down the hall with Kasumi hot on her heels.<p>-<p>His eyes opened slowly as he heard voices in the background. His entire body felt stronger, but considering what just happened he wasn't surprised. He felt sad since he could feel the change more accutely this time, and knew the inevitable was a lot closer.<p>Ranma silently got up and looked around himself. There was a cushion next to where he was sleeping. *Probably Hinako.* He thought, knowing Aeris could never before stomach what was happening to him and that Hinako understood it a lot better than anyone else. That brought him to another line of thought just as he recognized the voices as coming from the kitchen. *What am I going to do about Hinako?* He didn't put it past his opponent to attack the teacher when he wasn't around. It would be a way to gain an advantage for their coming confrontation.<p>With that in mind he started walking to the kitchen.<p>His steps didn't go unheard, as the conversation in the other room abruptly ended and the teacher nearly ran into him when coming out. He could hear the distinct sound of Aeris giggling, but didn't turn to the source as he was focused on Hinako, who right now had a hand on his forehead. "How are you feeling?" She asked with no small amount of concern in her voice.<p>Ranma smiled faintly but didn't remove her hand like he'd done before. The feeling the gesture gave him was complicated, but pleasant in some way. "I'm fine."<p>Hinako traced her hand down his face before reluctantly breaking contact. His skin felt a lot smoother now.<p>Aeris walked from behind Hinako, an amused smile on her face. "About time you woke up, bro." She joked, but the comment was strained. It was obvious she was worried about him. "We nearly ran out of things to talk about."<p>Ranma groaned at this. *I bet she did her best to embarrass me.* It was then that he recognized the way Aeris addressed him. "Bro?"<p>Aeris shrugged. "I was told your real name is Ranma. I'm not sure I can call you that, so I'm settling for bro."<p>Hinako smiled in amusement at the expression on Ranma's face.<p>Ranma shook his head to clear it and turned to more important matters. "You can't go to school alone anymore." He said seriously at Hinako.<p>"What?"<p>The pigtailed man continued as if he wasn't interrupted. "He saw you next to me. We can't give him a clean shot at you."<p>Hinako frowned at Ranma's over protectiveness. "I can take care of myself." She protested as she took a hand to her bracelet.<p>Aeris jumped in before Ranma could argue the point. "Maybe you can, but we shouldn't take the chance." With that she lifted her arm for Hinako to see the bracelet there. "I would avoid a confrontation with him if bro wasn't with me. Trust me, you don't know what he's capable of."<p>Hinako didn't concede the point, but she didn't argue it either. "What about the Tendos?" If Ranma started walking her to school they would have trouble with Akane and her family.<p>Ranma grimaced, but firmed his resolve. "I'll deal with them if I have to." The thought of hurting Kasumi further made him sick to his stomach, but it would be far worse if something happened to Hinako. *Kasumi will shed more tears, Hinako will die.*<p>The teacher knew there was more to it than Ranma and Aeris were letting on. She decided to ask about that later. For now she was curious about something Aeris let out hours before. "You mentioned something about a project."<p>Ranma and Aeris exchanged a quick glance. The pigtailed man nodded and turned to Hinako. "I guess it's about time you know what really happened to me." With that he started for his pack.<p>"I thought you didn't remember." She said in a slight accusing tone.<p>Aeris placed a hand on her shoulder to get her attention. "He doesn't. The trauma was too great for his mind to have any clear memories." She paused and bit her lip. "Besides the fact that he was forced to forget."<p>"Ranma?" Hinako asked as she saw him take out the same folder he was reading the other day. Without a word he gave it to her. Upon opening it she read the first page aloud. "Project GEHW-R. Professor Hojo."<p>The pigtailed man sat down on the floor and reached for his katana. He silently studied the hilt, obviously trying to distract himself from his worry of what Hinako would think of him once she read the entire thing.<p>Aeris smiled sadly at Hinako. "Read it. All of it. We'll talk tomorrow." With that said she sat next to Ranma and punched him in the arm. She wasn't surprised when he didn't acknowledge her.<p>Hinako silently left to her room. She had a lot of reading to do.<p>END PART 7<p>Author's notes: Three guesses on who's the guy with white hair.<p>What happened at the Tendo Dojo? I bet you can all guess, and things are definitely going to take an interesting twist there.<p>The next release of this fic will be the Project GEHW-R just as Hinako will read it. It'll clear exactly what happened to Ranma, and what's still happening to him.
