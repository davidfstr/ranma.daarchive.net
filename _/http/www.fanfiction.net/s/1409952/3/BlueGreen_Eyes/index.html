</div>She was returning home after a long day of work. All her worries on not getting wet now that it had started raining.<p>Luckily she had taken her umbrella with her that morning, so she was well prepared. Just as she turned the corner to her block she saw a man running blindly towards her. She didn't have time to react before he crashed into her, taking the air out of her lungs as they fell in a heap.<p>The shock of the blow together with the cold water hitting her made her lose her awareness for a few seconds. She recovered to feel angry at whoever had run into her, probably going for a quick feel of her body. She sat up and turned with a glare directed towards the man.<p>A glare that vanished when she caught sight of him. All her anger vanished and she couldn't help but feel sorry for this man. He was crying softly in a fetal position, muttering something she couldn't understand.<p>Forgetting all about her earlier anger she reached forward and placed a hand on his shoulder. "Are you alright?" She asked softly.<p>As soon as Ranma felt the warm touch and heard the words he retreated quickly, as if her hand was burning hot. "Get away!" He managed to get out in between sobs.<p>She felt hurt at the reaction she brought out of this man. Trying her best to ignore the feeling she reached forward again. This time he didn't make a move. "What's wrong?" She asked again.<p>Ranma didn't hear her, neither did he feel her hand hesitantly touch his forearm. He was too immersed in his own despair to notice anything. He was returning to it again, to that safe place where nothing hurt. He wanted so badly to let go. Just as he was slipping back into that state he was brought back to reality by something he hadn't felt in a while. And he was surprised he felt it, too.<p>She saw the man's eyes start losing all their fire, all their life. Even if it was only pain that she could see in them she couldn't allow for him to die like this. She tried moving him to make him return, yet he continued to fall deeper and deeper into himself. As a last resort she slapped him across the face, hard. Her hand flared in pain as she sat back and gave a sigh of relief when she noticed his eyes recovered some sanity.<p>Ranma came back to find himself sitting down against a wall, a heavy rain pouring down. He looked at the woman in front of him in confusion, wondering what she was doing there. He thought hard about it and slowly, but surely, he remembered what had gotten him in that state.<p>She noticed his eyes scanning his surroundings, then her. She felt a little self-conscious as the man looked at her with his blue-green eyes. Her features formed a frown when she saw his eyes returning to the pain, even if his sanity remained.<p>Ranma dropped his gaze and sighed. "Sorry. I didn't intend to run you over."<p>"I know." She softly said.<p>He got up and offered a hand to the woman, which she took. As he helped her to her feet he noticed she had a warm touch, probably because her hand had just impacted with his face very hard. Letting go of her he turned around to walk away. "Is that all I get? Just an apology and you're off?" He heard the woman's voice behind him. He lowered his gaze to his hands and stared at them.<p>The rain poured down even harder than before, yet neither of them moved to get cover. The man had much bigger problems than a little rain, the woman was too intrigued by him to notice her getting wet.<p>Finally, after several long minutes, Ranma asked back. "Then what would you like?"<p>"An explanation would be nice." She answered firmly.<p>Ranma understood she wasn't making a request. "That's it?" He turned around asking.<p>She nodded seriously. "Yes. When you're done I won't stop you from leaving."<p>He shrugged. "I guess I owe you that, at least." Truth be told, he was grateful to her. Had it not been for her he would have done something he would later regret.<p>She giggled for a moment as he started talking. When he asked her why she gave him a sarcastic look. "Shouldn't we get indoors? I don't want to get a cold and I'm sure you don't want that either."<p>"Where could we go?" He asked.<p>"My place is down this block. I'm sure we can talk there." She provided as she went to retrieve her umbrella and closed it. She was soaked to the bone, so she didn't really need it right now.<p>Ranma eyed her curiously. "Aren't you worried about letting some strange man you just met on the street into your house?"<p>She smiled at him. "I'm sure you won't be doing anything improper to me." She started walking down the street. "Besides, I can take care of myself."<p>Ranma reluctantly followed her and they entered her apartment. "Wait here." She commanded as she took off her shoes and walked into another room, leaving him alone by the door. The pigtailed man waited patiently for a couple of minutes, every one of them convincing himself to stay. He did owe it to her. She finally returned, wearing a bathrobe and her hair up in a towel. In her hands were another towel and robe. "Dry yourself up and put this on. I'll put your clothes in the dryer."<p>He protested as soon as she had finished talking. "Being wet doesn't bother me." He felt really nervous with this situation. Alone with a woman in her house, both wearing nothing but bathrobes.<p>She frowned and spoke in a tone of voice that made him feel stupid. "I don't want any of my furniture ruined because you sat there all wet. Now please take your clothes off and dry yourself up. I'll be waiting in the living room." And with that she placed the towel and bathrobe on his hands and left.<p>Ranma remained motionless for a couple of seconds and wondered how could she order him around so easily. *And why am I going along with it?* He stripped to his boxers and dried himself. He put the robe on, and followed his hostess.<p>She looked up from her book when she heard the sound of footsteps. She was met with the sight of a tall man wearing a robe that didn't really fit him. His shoulders too broad for it. Most of his chest was left uncovered and she could see that he must exercise regularly. She stood up and took the clothes from his hands, taking them with her.<p>A few minutes later they were both sitting comfortably, cups of steaming tea on the table, and the sounds of a drying machine in the background. "So, what do you want to know?" He asked as he noticed the tea was very good, not as good as Kasumi's but very good indeed.<p>"Why don't you tell me why you were running down the street?"<p>He did. For some strange reason he told her everything from the moment he woke up to the time he crashed into her. He was indebted to this woman and wouldn't pay her back with nothing but complete honesty. He omitted to mention any names, of course.<p>She heard every word attentively, never her eyes leaving his. Their tea got cold as he spoke, but neither noticed. When he finished she shook her head and sighed. "So all that was because of a misunderstanding."<p>Ranma looked downcast. "The fact remains. She was hurt because of me."<p>The woman shook her head and said. "I don't think so. I believe it was all Tendo Akane's fault."<p>Ranma was so startled that he spilled the tea all over himself. He looked at the woman in disbelief. "How?"<p>She shrugged. "I happen to know Akane. I also know all about her temper problem and bad habits. As for the rest, your description was so accurate that I could easily tell the middle sister is her older sister, Tendo Nabiki."<p>He chuckled at the coincidence taking place. But of course, he should have expected something like this, considering the interesting life he seemed to be cursed with. "I just now realize that I don't know your name."<p>She smiled as she extended her hand forward. "I'm Ninomiya Hinako."<p>Ranma didn't quite meet her smile but shook her hand either way. "A pleasure to meet you, Ninomiya-san."<p>"Just Hinako is fine." She said. "What about you?"<p>He thought for a moment and answered. "I've been told by Nabiki-san that my name is Saotome Ranma. After what happened I'm pretty sure I shouldn't be calling myself Saotome anymore. Just call me Ranma."<p>Hinako was a little surprised this man took so lightly being disowned. She wondered what kind of problems he had to feel losing his family name was nothing. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Ranma." She said as she smiled widely. It had been a long time since she could talk to someone like this.<p>-<p>Hinako eventually managed to convince her guest to stay for the night. He argued that it wasn't proper and that he should be going, but she ignored him and almost had to physically force him to sleep on the couch instead of walking out the door.<p>As the man, just Ranma as he wanted to be called, stared up at the ceiling he wondered why he wasn't feeling as bad as he should. He did feel hurt about the whole incident in the Tendo Dojo, but he no longer felt as if he was about to die.<p>He didn't have much trouble finding an answer. *Hinako.* He thought with mixed feelings. On the one hand he was grateful to the teacher for giving him her unquestioned support when he most needed it. On the other he felt as if he was betraying Kasumi. Both women had done so much for him, yet Kasumi he somehow managed to hurt. The look in her eyes was more than enough for him. And now Hinako. How would he repay her for what she'd done? Most importantly still. Could he stay with her without somehow getting her hurt as well?<p>Needless to say he didn't get much sleep that night.<p>-<p>Nabiki walked into the kitchen the next morning, intent on talking to Kasumi about what had happened the day before.<p>Now that she had slept and calmed down she was seeing things from a different perspective, and she wanted to know from Kasumi herself what had really happened. She found the kitchen to be empty, though breakfast was already finished, and headed to the dojo. Entering the room she noticed no one had been here from the day before. The hole on the wall and the weapons scattered all over the floor proving that fact.<p>She walked forward and knelt where Ranma was standing before being kicked out. Nabiki took the shuriken Ranma had in his hand when he was facing Akane. Her eyes widened in surprise at seeing they were crushed, the marks on them leaving no doubt as to what happened to the metal weapons. *Ranma. He did this with his bare hands!* And there wasn't blood anywhere.<p>Nabiki was one of the sharpest people in Nerima, her brain working incredibly fast to always gain an advantage over others. This time was no exception and all leads pointed at one fact she didn't like at all.<p>Getting up she walked back into the house and up the stairs, purposely heading for one of the guestrooms. Sure enough when she slid the door open she found her sister already there, rummaging through the contents of Ranma's backpack. "Kasumi?" She called softly, not wanting to have the entire household here to ruin their conversation.<p>Nabiki saw Kasumi stiffen and relax almost instantly after. She turned around with one of her pleasant smiles, one Nabiki was already starting to hate. "Nabiki-chan, you're up early."<p>The middle Tendo sister closed the door behind her and knelt next to Kasumi. "Save it, Kasumi. I know something's wrong." And to make her point clearer she shower Kasumi one of the ruined shuriken. "If Ranma-kun did this, and I'm pretty sure it must have been him since no one else in the house can, then he didn't attack you at all." *You wouldn't be here right now if he did.* She thought to herself.<p>Kasumi remained smiling at her sister, yet in the inside there was a war taking place. She had come this morning to Ranma's room to get his pack and take it to him, wherever he was. She couldn't face her family with something that would make them unhappy and was willing to sacrifice her own desires, again, for them. She didn't get much sleep thinking about how to explain what happened to her father. That it wasn't Ranma-kun's fault so that he could return to the house. But that would hurt both Soun and Akane, and she couldn't do that. She couldn't destroy Soun's dream of Akane being his heir, nor Akane's fantasy world where she was never wrong. Even if it was the wrong path to take she would do it for her family.<p>Now Nabiki was confronting her, demanding to know what had really happened. And if she knew something about her sister it was that she had little to no reserves when it came to defending her family. Kasumi most of all. Nabiki resented Soun for not supporting his own family, and thus being forced to become the feared Ice Queen, and Akane for being such a spoiled little princess, but Kasumi she looked up to whenever she felt down.<p>Kasumi didn't want a fight between Nabiki and Akane, which would obviously be the result of the former learning the truth, so she kept acting as if she didn't know what her sister was talking about.<p>Nabiki waited impatiently for her sister to make up her mind, and when she noticed Kasumi wouldn't talk about it she narrowed her eyes. "Fine, then I guess that bastard did attack you." She got up and turned around. "Don't worry. I'll make sure he pays for what he did."<p>Kasumi heard the words and instantly her expression fell to be replaced by worry and fear. "Nabiki." She whispered, hoping her sister would stop. When the middle Tendo sister took a step away Kasumi reached forward and took her hand. "Please wait, Nabiki." She pleaded. "I'll tell you everything." She finished in a whisper, her eyes downcast.<p>Nabiki turned around with her usual expressionless mask and sat down. "I'm listening." And listen she did. As Kasumi explained in detail what had happened she devoured every word, but never letting her feelings on the matter show on her face.<p>Kasumi looked really downcast by the time she finished the story. She didn't tell Nabiki about the pain in Ranma's eyes, but she didn't have to do it to remember it. She looked up to see Nabiki smiling at her. "It's good to see I was right." Kasumi understood then. Her sister had manipulated her into opening up.<p>"That wasn't very nice, Nabiki." She said halfheartedly.<p>Nabiki embraced her sister. "To hell with being nice." *At last.* She thought happily as Kasumi returned the hug. It had been a long time since she wanted to repay Kasumi for all she had done, but never had the chance.<p>A few minutes passed and they finally broke apart. "So what were you doing?" Nabiki asked.<p>Kasumi turned to Ranma's backpack. "I was emptying Ranma-kun's pack so that I could take it to him." And it was true. There was a pile of stuff next to the huge pack, most of it Genma's.<p>"But?" Nabiki asked, knowing there was more to it.<p>"But there's nothing left inside and I still can't lift it." Kasumi said, and a little frustration tinted her voice.<p>"Let me help you. I carry Kuno-chan to class every morning." Nabiki said seriously as she took a hold of the straps.<p>They seriously tried, both exerting to their limits. It was no wonder Nabiki was shocked when the pack didn't budge an inch. She inspected it more closely and could see the floorboards were already bending down because of the immense weight. "And he carried this as if it was nothing. He must be a monster." She whispered.<p>"Nabiki!" Kasumi reprimanded sternly, mostly because she had seen Ranma's pain increase tenfold when called a 'monster' by Genma.<p>Nabiki lifted her arms to placate her sister. "Sorry. But you got to admit, no normal person can lift that much weight with as little effort as Ranma- kun." When Kasumi's expression fell she instantly knew what was wrong. "We could try to convince daddy it was all an accident so that Ranma-kun can return here."<p>Kasumi smiled at her sister but shook her head. "Akane won't allow it. She'll just find another excuse to get rid of him."<p>Nabiki's expression hardened. "If she doesn't like it..."<p>"No!" Kasumi firmly stated, to which Nabiki almost fell back. She sure as hell wasn't used to Kasumi raising her voice. "I won't allow there to be fights within this family." Considering the subject done with she stood up and continued. "I believe it won't do us any good carrying Ranma-kun's things out. We don't know where he is."<p>Nabiki stood up as well and smirked. "That's where I come in. I'll have him found by the end of the day."<p>With that both sisters left the guestroom to continue with the daily activities. In the hallway they greeted Akane, who was eagerly making her way outside to train with Genma and Soun.<p>-<p>He opened his eyes to see a different ceiling to the one he was used to. It didn't take him more than two seconds to remember where he was and why. Heaving a sigh he sat up, noticing that sunrise would be in about an hour. *Now what do I do?* He asked himself. During his stay in the Tendo dojo he would get up at this hour to help Kasumi with the chores, yet he didn't know what to do with his time now that he wasn't living there anymore. He suddenly turned sharply to the kitchen door. Even though the door was closed he knew someone was in there by the sounds coming from inside.<p>Ranma stood up and stretched. He noticed his clothes were neatly folded on a chair next to the couch. He smiled as he got dressed and folded the blanket Hinako gave him last night. Doing so brought him the feeling that yesterday's events didn't happen. Even if he knew having such thoughts would eventually hurt him, he relished in the feeling of peace.<p>He slowly walked to the kitchen and softly knocked on the door. "Come in." Came a child's voice. Ranma frowned a little and did as he was told. He entered the kitchen to find a little girl working on the stove. "Good morning.." She greeted cheerfully. "Breakfast will be ready shortly."<p>Ranma raised an eyebrow. "Are you Hinako-san's sister? I didn't see you last night."<p>The girl visibly slumped down. "It's a long story." She started.<p>Some time later Hinako finished explaining how she only took her adult form whenever she drained the battle aura from someone. An old man by the name of Happosai trained her in such techniques to help her, since she was sick. During the explanation she couldn't really meet Ranma's eyes. Not because they made her nervous, even if they were a little disconcerting, but because she felt Ranma would reject her as so many others did. Either they were attracted to her because of her body alone, or they ran off because of what she was. "I'll understand if you don't want anything to do with this 'vampire.'" She finished.<p>To her surprise laughter filled the room. She lifted her gaze to see Ranma laughing joyfully. She didn't know why he was laughing, so confused she was. It took a full five minutes for Ranma to control himself enough to talk again. Wiping tears away from his eyes and still smiling he finally put an end to Hinako's torment. "Sorry about that. It's just that I can't see why you would call yourself a vampire." *And the fact that I don't know why other people would be scared of her for such a harmless reason.* He added to himself.<p>Hinako scowled. "I suck people's energy to keep my adult form, that's not funny."<p>Ranma sobered somewhat, noticing he was upsetting her. "It's not supposed to be. Just be glad your problem isn't so serious."<p>Hinako was taken aback by the conviction in Ranma's voice. She wondered what kind of problems this man had to consider absorbing other people's auras not a serious problem. She was taken out of her reverie when Ranma waved a hand in front of her eyes to call her attention. "What is it?" She asked.<p>"Shouldn't you be going to school? You said you were a teacher at Furinkan, right?" He said taking a look at a clock. He didn't even blink but Hinako either way seemed to vanish, all the time cursing for not noticing the hour.<p>She was ready in record time and by the door when something occurred to her. Turning around to face Ranma she smiled. "There's a spare key hanging in the kitchen next to the door. If you go out take it with you." Before he could argue she wiggled a finger in front of her, a cute gesture coming from a child. "I want you back before dinner. We'll talk then." And with that she closed the door and left the man alone.<p>"Great." Was all he could think to say.<p>-<p>"You didn't have to beat him so badly." Nabiki and Akane were walking back from school. The middle Tendo sister was scolding her younger sister for something that happened during the morning battle.<p>Akane frowned but didn't turn to regard her sister. "That pervert had it coming."<p>Her expression remaining cold Nabiki didn't relent. "You broke his arm, Akane." The youngest Tendo gave special attention to one of her admirers that morning, something that happened because he managed to tag her on her shoulder with a sloppy kick. Akane gave him a sound beating and broke his arm when he was begging for her to stop. *She's not improving with her anger problems.* Nabiki thought bitterly. She had hoped that Soun and Genma's training would give Akane some control. *Far from it.* Akane kept on accumulating anger, and now she was dangerous with the skills the masters of the Anything Goes kept teaching her.<p>Akane snorted. "He won't bother me again, then."<p>Nabiki shook her head, knowing it was useless. Akane wouldn't accept she was wrong. Ever.<p>As they continued walking, Nabiki caught something out of the corner of her eye. She did her best to act casual, and was successful as usual, as she checked her watch. "I've got some business to attend to, Akane. Tell Kasumi I'll be back for dinner." The youngest Tendo nodded and she started walking down another street, noticing how luck seemed to be on her side today.<p>-<p>He walked aimlessly through the streets of Nerima, mostly to get a feel of the place. Even if he had been living here for a while now, it was the first time he actually paid any attention to his surroundings. "This is a peaceful place. I could get used to live here." In truth, he welcomed the peace and quiet.<p>Turning around a corner, Ranma saw a park not too far away. He smiled, remembering his time spent in the wilderness, and most importantly, his connection to the life of the planet. He felt at peace every time he was closer to mother nature.<p>Having nothing better to do, the pigtailed man made his way to the small park. There were a few people there, mostly couples. He took a deep breath and smiled as he sat beneath a large tree, thoughts leaving his mind as he connected with the energy flow of the planet.<p>Ranma smiled as he could feel the planet was full of life. Even if modern technology severely depleted the natural resources and contaminated the environment, the cycle of the planet was not altered. Earth was even compensating for humanity's actions with some climatic phenomena. There were some isolated events he would have to check out, but it wasn't something serious that required his immediate attention.<p>Burrowing his brows in concentration he let his body feed from the life of the planet. Without his noticing he started to attract the attention of the bystanders. Even if he picked a secluded spot people still noticed the show. Small tendrils of misty energy left the ground to be absorbed by his body. The grass around him started to grow noticeably and a few birds landed close to him, their animal gazes fully focused on the softly glowing man.<p>Murmurs of disbelief were heard all over yet he didn't notice. More people started gathering around, Nabiki was one of them and stared with wide eyes at the show. *Ranma-kun?*<p>After about half an hour Ranma finally cut his direct connection to the planet. He opened his eyes and blinked at all the people giving him the weird looks. "What?" He asked no one in particular and trying to find a way out of this mess.<p>The following massive facefault caused a small tremor in the park. Comments of disbelief could be heard as the crowd started to disperse. This was Nerima, after all. Weird events didn't hold people's attention for very long.<p>Ranma blinked again just as Nabiki approached him. He noticed the middle Tendo sister approaching and decided to leave before she could lash out at him for last night. He wasn't up to withstanding another emotional assault.<p>Nabiki saw Ranma look at her and cursed inwardly as his features revealed a painful expression just as he got up to leave. "Ranma-kun, wait!" She called as he started walking away. He stopped before taking two steps.<p>Maybe it was the tone of Nabiki's voice, or the fact that he wanted to know if Kasumi was okay. Ranma didn't know but either way stopped and slowly turned around. He saw as Nabiki, still in her school uniform, made her way to him. Her expression was unreadable, but he was used to it. "Nabiki-san?"<p>Nabiki stopped next to the pigtailed man. She idly wondered if the cool air around them was the result of whatever he was doing before. Shaking that thought out of her mind she concentrated on the matter at hand, her sister was more important than satisfying her curiosity. "Ranma-kun, I'm sorry for yesterday." She said with difficulty. It wasn't easy for her to ask for forgiveness.<p>Ranma's eyes widened a little at that. "Huh?" He asked intelligently.<p>Nabiki inwardly smirked at that. It was obvious Ranma didn't expect that from her. Actually seeing he was taken off-guard returned her to known ground. "We need to talk." She said at length.<p>-<p>"Thank you, Nabiki-san." Ranma said. They were talking in a cafe next to the park since Nabiki suggested they move to a more comfortable place. Ranma didn't understand what could be more comfortable than sitting under a tree but obliged.<p>"For what?"<p>Ranma smiled. "For telling me Kasumi-san is fine. I wouldn't be able to take it if she was more hurt because of me."<p>Nabiki frowned. "That's just the point, Ranma-kun. She never was hurt because of you in the first place." She didn't understand what was wrong with Kasumi and Ranma. They were both trying to make sure the other wasn't hurt and ended up blaming themselves for others' doing.<p>"Yesterday she wouldn't have been hurt had it not been for my presence. I'm the one that suggested cleaning the dojo's weaponry." Ranma said seriously.<p>Nabiki decided to stop pursuing the matter. It was obvious Ranma would keep on blaming himself for the event. "Either way, I'm here to take you back to the dojo. Even if you won't stay there, and make damn sure you understand I want you to return, Kasumi told me to find you so you could get your pack."<p>Ranma thought about it for a moment. He really didn't want for any of his stuff to fall on his father's hands. It would be a bad thing if someone discovered the hidden box in the pack, but even more so if that someone was Genma. "I don't think your father or sister will like to see me there, though." The man said.<p>Nabiki shrugged it off. "Our fathers should be training Akane in the dojo by the time we arrive. We'll have plenty of time for you to get your pack without them finding out."<p>Ranma opposed resistance for a couple of minutes more, but the urge to see Kasumi coupled with Nabiki's resolve made him accept.<p>-<p>Just as Nabiki predicted Kasumi was the only one in the house when they arrived. "Kasumi." Nabiki called as they entered the house. She was careful to keep her voice down so that only her sister heard her call.<p>The eldest Tendo sister walked out of the kitchen, her eyes quickly caught the form of Ranma as he uncomfortably stood next to her sister. "Ranma- kun." She whispered, both relieved at seeing him and afraid she would hurt him again. After what he'd done for her she'd been horrible to him, failing to help him when he most needed it.<p>Nabiki smirked and left the room to make sure they weren't caught unaware by any of the people in the dojo.<p>Kasumi finally broke the silence after a couple of minutes. "Ranma-kun, I'm so glad to see you're fine. When you left yesterday..." She trailed off berating herself for bringing that up.<p>Ranma scratched the back of his head. "Yeah. I was lucky someone was kind enough to take me in. She saved me from falling in again."<p>"She?" Kasumi inquired.<p>Ranma, oblivious to her interest, nodded. "Hinako-san was kind enough to offer me a place to stay."<p>Kasumi nodded. "I'm glad for you. Let us go get your pack."<p>With that they quickly made their way to the guestroom and Ranma effortlessly picked it up. "Thank you, Kasumi-san." She only nodded and led him to the door.<p>"I'm sorry for the trouble you went through, Ranma-kun." Kasumi said with a sad expression on her face. She really didn't blame Ranma for moving on with his life. She understood he must feel she failed him.<p>Ranma shook his head. "I'm the one who should be sorry, Kasumi-san. Even after all you did for me what I ended up doing was hurt you." Putting his pack down he opened it and shuffled through its contents until he took a small object out. He closed it again and turned to Kasumi. "For you." He said offering Kasumi a small ring.<p>"Ranma-kun?" Kasumi asked uncertain as she took the ring from his hand.<p>Ranma smiled faintly. "I did promise to protect you. Carry that ring with you, even if you only keep it in your pocket. If you're ever in trouble tap the blue stone twice, I'll be there as soon as I can." He didn't mention other qualities the ring had, but they weren't really important.<p>Kasumi studied the ring. It was simple enough, with only the blue stone as decoration. She smiled up as she locked gazes with Ranma. "Thank you, Ranma- kun."<p>With that Ranma smiled back and turned around, walking out of the house and the Tendo grounds. Kasumi followed his form until he disappeared and sighed. *Ranma-kun.* She entered the house to finish preparing dinner for her family..<p>-<p>Nabiki kept running as she looked for Ranma. She couldn't believe he would just go after getting his pack. In fact she couldn't believe he left at all after seeing him look at Kasumi upon arriving. As soon as Kasumi told her Ranma left she ran out looking for the pigtailed man.<p>She was breathing raggedly as she turned a corner and promised herself to start exercising more after this was all over. Another empty street. She cursed under her breath and ran to the next intersection. Why was she looking for him, anyway? She couldn't come up with an answer. All she knew was that she needed to find him.<p>She reached the intersection and no sign of him. *At the very least I'll find him to make him pay.* He was making her run a lot.<p>-<p>Ranma sighed as he continued walking, the familiar weight of his backpack over his shoulders. So far he had managed to part ways with the only person he cared about, even if they did part in good terms and he was sure they would continue to see each other, Ranma knew Kasumi's world didn't have space for him.<p>*And now what?* He asked himself. Hinako was adamant about him staying with her until he was back on his feet. Even if he disliked the idea of accepting her offer he disliked the idea of upsetting her even more.<p>He did understand the fact that he needed time to take control of his life, and Hinako's support was not something that would stop him from achieving that goal. Far from it.<p>But he didn't want to freeload either. That only left him the choice of getting a job and helping with the chores around the house.<p>Getting a job would be a quest in itself, since he didn't know who would be willing to hire him.<p>Just as this thought passed through his mind he turned around a corner. He came face to face with a man that seemed familiar. He didn't have time to duel on it for long since he was sent flying back by a powerful punch to the face.<p>Ranma landed roughly on his back, his backpack softening the fall somewhat. His eyes quickly focused on the owner of the offending fist, who was glaring at him hatefully. "What was that for?" Ranma asked as he started to get up.<p>The other man adjusted his glasses and assumed a fighting stance. Inwardly he was seething in rage, which was taking all of his concentration to not attack recklessly. Doing so could be dangerous for him, his knuckles flaring in pain after connecting that blow proved that fact. So concentrated was he that words were out of the question.<p>Seeing that he would get no answer, and not being in a particularly good mood after being attacked for no reason, Ranma glared back at the man in the gi. He let his backpack drop, which cracked the asphalt on impact with the ground.<p>The man in the gi tensed on seeing this, wondering just how much the monster's strength was enhanced by that weird energy of his. As it seemed so far normal attacks would be next to useless, while more unconventional means would take longer to connect. And that was a time he didn't have in this particular fight.<p>Ranma assumed a somewhat basic stance. "You are going to regret messing with me." He growled out. Maybe fighting would help clear his head. Hopefully he would run into one of those 'Black Dragons' after this was over. He had a lot of stress to work off and even though he wouldn't kill this man, the thugs that dared attack Kasumi wouldn't be that lucky.<p>Both fighters jumped towards each other. "STOP!" Only to be interrupted almost instantly by a female voice. They both turned to see the owner of that voice, yet none took their attention completely off their opponent.<p>Nabiki doubled over and fought to get back her breath. She didn't know how she was able to scream that loud but didn't care. So far it seemed Ranma and Tofu were more concerned on her than on fighting each other.<p>Ranma straightened and waited for Nabiki to take control of the situation. The middle Tendo sister didn't take long and stepped forward.<p>Nabiki didn't need to be a genius to know what happened. Even if she only arrived to see Ranma and Tofu about to attack each other she could guess Ranma didn't start this fight. Stopping by Ranma's side she turned to glare at Tofu, who blinked at her obvious defense of the pigtailed man.<p>END PART 3<p>Author's notes: A third chapter out, and I believe it'll slow down from here.
