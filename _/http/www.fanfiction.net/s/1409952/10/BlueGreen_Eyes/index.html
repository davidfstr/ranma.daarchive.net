</div>It was early in the morning when the phone rang in Hinako's apartment. Even at the early hour everyone was already up and around, getting ready to go to Furinkan.<p>The teacher, though, both expected and dreaded the call she received. Sure enough, upon answering, she heard the voice of the school secretary. The conversation wasn't long, in fact only a couple of sentences were exchanged, but when it was over Hinako couldn't help but sigh. Reassigned. While it was true she wasn't responsible for the attack on the school, in fact she helped with the wounded, she'd confronted Kuno for Ranma's sake. While the secretary didn't give her a reason for the change it was almost obvious why it took place. Kuno.<p>Hinako walked back into the kitchen and found Aeris in the middle of breakfast. Ranma sat by her side with an impassive expression on his face. "It wasn't good news." The pigtailed man said with a tone of voice the teacher had learned to associate with Ranma, meaning a depressed one.<p>Aeris looked up at the words and turned to Hinako curiously.<p>The teacher smiled faintly and sat next to her guests. "For Aeris they are. I've been assigned to another school, so instead of going to Furinkan we should start packing. Even if I've been assigned to a school in a different district of Tokyo I'd like to be able to walk to work." She mock-glared at Ranma. "And no, this wasn't your fault. It was bound to happen sooner or later."<p>Ranma remained silent, but inwardly he smiled at Hinako's attempt to make him feel better. The woman had come to know him very well over the short time they'd spent together.<p>"At least I'm out of this stupid uniform." Aeris said with a happy smile and rushed out of the kitchen to get changed.<p>Hinako laughed and turned to Ranma. "She's still going to school, just a different one."<p>"Do you know which one?" The pigtailed man couldn't suppress a chuckle from escaping his lips.<p>The teacher nodded and, though she didn't feel her departure from Furinkan was under the right circumstances, she was glad for the place where she'd be teaching next. If the rumors were to be believed the students could use a teacher like her, if not as a disciplinarian as a defender. "Juuban High."<p>-<p>"Kasumi..." Soun started as he entered the kitchen. Nabiki and Akane had just gone off to school, the former completely ignoring Soun during breakfast and giving her younger sister the cold shoulder. The Tendo patriarch could only watch and hold back the tears at the sight, Nabiki was so much like her mother...<p>Genma was currently waiting in the living room while Shampoo had disappeared just after breakfast. Both Genma and Soun wished she didn't come back.<p>Kasumi, who was still really depressed from last night, smiled faintly. "Can I do something for you, father?" She was just about to finish washing the dishes.<p>Soun felt a lump on his throat and swallowed it down with great effort. He couldn't believe how hard it was to face his daughter after yesterday's events. "Kasumi... I'm really sorry about what happened. I..."<p>The young woman's smile lightened a little and she placed a hand on Soun's shoulder. Her father's attempt at an apology, with the amount of regret she could see in his eyes, gave her hope that they still had a chance to make things right. "Father... I'm still very upset about what happened to Ranma- kun, but I'm not angry at you. I know you were just trying to protect me."<p>"... Why didn't you tell me?"<p>Kasumi let go of Soun's shoulder and resumed washing the dishes, her eyes avoiding his gaze uncomfortably. "I... don't know. You and Akane were so angry..." The eldest of the Tendo sisters sighed and dried her hands on her apron. "I wanted to avoid what happened yesterday. Thankfully Akane-chan wasn't involved." While she loved her sister she had to admit Akane's temper usually got the better of her. "While I hurt at seeing Ranma-kun treated so unfairly, the thought of having our family torn apart scared me. Ranma-kun is so kind... he understood without needing me to tell him."<p>Soun remained silent for a moment while Kasumi went about her business in the kitchen, guilt and shame for his actions eating at him. While he had been in the wrong, blinded by an irrational rage and hunting Genma's son down, his little girl was suffering and keeping it all inside. She was sacrificing herself for the family... again.<p>And Ranma...<p>That boy didn't act honorably; otherwise he would've spoken the truth. Cleared things out. Soun couldn't help but respect the boy even more for his actions. While it was true he disregarded honor, he did it for Kasumi. "Kasumi?"<p>"Yes, father?"<p>"Would you like Ranma to return to this house?" Soun asked with a serious expression on his face.<p>Kasumi was surprised by the question, and as such she took her time to think about the answer to give. "I would like to have Ranma-kun in the house again... but I don't think it's a good idea."<p>"Kasumi?"<p>The eldest Tendo sister looked at her father with a sad smile. "Akane-chan wouldn't take well to it, father. You know that as well as I do."<p>Soun indeed knew. Akane was as stubborn as he was. If it hadn't been for Kasumi's tears yesterday, cutting through his righteous anger, he'd still be upset at the pigtailed young man. "But..."<p>"Would you like some tea as you play shogi with uncle Saotome, father?" Kasumi politely changed the subject, uncomfortable in the extreme with the place where the line of questioning was going. She was almost certain Soun and Genma would try to press the engagement between the families. I need to talk to Nabiki about this. On the other hand, she was feeling hopeful with Soun's repentant behavior. Maybe Nabiki could figure out a way to have Soun return to his old self, the man that died together with their mother.<p>Soun nodded his thanks to Kasumi and left the kitchen. While he didn't get the answers he wanted there was a lot to think about. Maybe a game of shogi would clear his mind enough to make the right choice.<p>-<p>Nabiki cursed under her breath, though in the outside she kept her face cool and expressionless, when she saw the shadow disappear around a corner. While she wasn't a martial artist like Akane she had extensive experience tailing people for her information gathering business. She knew how to recognize the signs of being followed.<p>While she didn't recognize the person she was certain of the fact that someone was following them to school. Whether it was Tofu, her father or Shampoo she didn't know. Doesn't really matter who it is. None of them should know where Ranma is staying. She thought with dismay as Akane started running, screaming about hating boys. And I really wanted to talk to him...<p>As Nabiki entered the school grounds, careful to stay out of the fight's way, Shampoo nodded to herself and walked back to the Tendo Dojo. Ryoga didn't make an appearance, but she could wait. Ay moment now her great- grandmother would arrive to make things right.<p>-<p>"Are you sure you want to go out dressed like that?" Aeris asked with a raised eyebrow.<p>Hinako, dressed in the white tank-top and black leather miniskirt, smiled at the younger girl. "It'll be a good way to get a discount. Besides, Ranma likes it."<p>"I bet he does." The girl mumbled under her breath after Hinako walked out of the room. Not only did her mother, in her forties, still dress like that. Now she had to see as another one started, and it was Zack's girlfriend to boot. Well, not really girlfriend I guess. But they are rather close.<p>They were going apartment-hunting to the Juuban district. While Aeris could take care of herself, something she'd proved in the past, neither of them wanted to risk being alone right now.<p>In the living room Ranma was staring at Hinako with a smile on his face. "Why dressed like that?"<p>The teacher twirled around for his benefit and winked. "You don't like it?" Truth be told she was enjoying the attention right now. She didn't really notice the looks others gave her when walking around in revealing clothes, but Ranma giving her an appraising stare was something Hinako definitely was beginning to treasure.<p>The pigtailed man chuckled. "Let's get going. We already wasted a good part of the morning."<p>"Aeris! We're leaving!" Hinako cried for the girl to hear.<p>"I'm coming. I'm coming." The girl's voice was heard and then she walked into the living room, dressed in her usual clothes. "Here I am trying to give you two lovebirds some time alone and you yell at me for it." Her voice was teasing while her amused eyes looked at the blush Hinako started to develop.<p>"Lovebirds?" Ranma blinked a couple of times.<p>"Never mind! Let's go." Hinako said hurriedly and took Ranma's arm to drag him out of the house.<p>Aeris rolled her eyes at the absurdity of it. Ranma was acting as if he didn't know what was happening, and he probably didn't, with Hinako blushing like a shy teenager. A woman with a body like that blushing like a schoolgirl. She giggled a little and rushed after the two of them.<p>-<p>It didn't take long for the trio to be roaming the streets of Juuban close to the school, maybe an hour or so. The trip had been spent mostly talking about what kind of house they should rent. Even if Aeris and Ranma told Hinako she should rent a house thinking only of herself the teacher shut down their protests effectively. "We don't know how long we'll have to stick together." She didn't mention the fact that she'd like to have Ranma around even if she didn't have to. After that argument was put on the table they talked about the kind of house they'd like.<p>Aeris didn't care about the inside of the house so long as she had where to sleep. What she would like to have, though, was some open space to practice her martial arts. If she returned to her parents and didn't keep up her training her mother would put her through worse than ever before.<p>Ranma added his two cents here, asking for a backyard that was secluded. Hinako understood perfectly his need for privacy from prying eyes. The show in the park had generated more than a few questions. They didn't need the Sailor Senshi adding to the fire by attacking Ranma when he felt the need to contact the life stream.<p>With that in mind Hinako was looking for a house with at least two rooms and a big backyard. She knew it would be expensive in Tokyo, but then again she could pay for it. As weird as it was her reassignment came with an increase in paycheck.<p>Right now the trio was looking at the third house of the day. It had a rather large backyard, yet the outside wall was low. Anyone from outside could see into the property with only standing on his or her tiptoes. "We'll have to keep looking." Hinako said with a relaxed smile. Walking around with Ranma and Aeris while hunting for a house was rather enjoyable. "You guys want to get something to eat before we continue?"<p>Ranma shrugged his shoulders, not feeling all that hungry, while Aeris grinned. Being a growing teenager, that also trained martial arts, food was very important to her. "Can we get some more of that chicken stuff? It tastes a lot better than chocobo."<p>Hinako laughed and nodded. She took Ranma's offered arm casually and they made their way to a small cafe. While Aeris ate a couple of chicken sandwiches both Hinako and Ranma had enough with a bowl of noodles and some tea.<p>Finished with her meal, but still wanting to rest her feet a little more, Hinako turned around to get a better look at the place they were at. It was actually interesting to find a place like this; it had a rather cozy feeling about it. The other patrons all had quiet conversations while the members of the staff worked with serene smiles on their faces. If she found an apartment close-by she'd be coming to this place a lot.<p>Ranma leaned back and started thinking about the woman from yesterday again. She didn't feel human. In fact she didn't feel like part of the life stream, meaning she's not from this planet. As if that wasn't weird enough, though the idea of aliens wasn't all that weird for Ranma, she was able to lift his sword effortlessly with one hand. Few were the ones that could even lift the thing, much less casually throw it at him. Aside from that what he found strange was the fact Kaze only seemed to appear to get him out of trouble. She didn't press him to get answers, something she could've done.<p>The pigtailed man was taken out of his thoughts when Hinako asked him a question. "How're you feeling?" The look of concern that she was giving him, together with Aeris', made him realize none of them had forgotten just how bad the last lapse was.<p>He shrugged indifferently. "I'm feeling as usual."<p>"The lapses are happening with less time in between them." Aeris said after swallowing the last bite of her sandwich.<p>Ranma nodded. "The process is nearing the final stages. It's natural that the lapses happen more and more for the last changes."<p>Five minutes later the three of them were walking outside, about to restart scouting the streets of Juuban close to the high school. None of them noticed the white-haired man standing in the shadows of an alley. Said man studied the trio carefully, taking notice of the equipment his prey and companions wore.<p>Just as they rounded a corner he turned on his heels and walked further into the shadows, unnoticed by all.<p>-<p>The old woman was hopping from rooftop to rooftop through Tokyo, balanced on a staff as she did so. The impossible feat went unnoticed by all, at the speeds she was going normal people would at most see a shadow flash by. She'd already located her great-granddaughter and the dojo she described in her letter, yet the old woman had other matters to attend to before getting her descendant out of the mess she got herself into. Or rather she had to correct a previous mess.<p>It wasn't difficult for someone with her experience and advanced chi senses to feel the young man's presence and follow it. In fact she'd have to be senile to miss it, since the boy projected an aura strong enough to dwarf anything she'd felt before. Even when he stayed in the village his aura wasn't even half as strong as it was now. And she was following the remains of his essence, left in the air hours ago... That could only mean the boy was stronger than any opponent the Amazons had heard of, Saffron and Herb not included.<p>Cologne, elder of the Amazons, stopped advancing and balanced herself on her staff. She was on top of a restaurant, where she could feel the trace a lot stronger and clearer. That could only mean he remained inside the building for a while before moving on, and even then he didn't move on a long time ago. I'm very close now. She thought and resumed hopping, intent on confronting the young man. There was simply no way she'd allow Shampoo to face against this boy again, and especially not now since he saw the purple-haired Amazon as a threat.<p>It took only five more minutes for Cologne to find her prey. It wasn't a difficult task, the boy stood out like a sore thumb. She was careful to hide her presence as she studied the young man, and two women with him, and noticed the changes from his time in the village. Gone was the faraway look in his eyes, replaced by a serious gaze that was unnerving coming from his blue-green eyes. His standing position had also changed, from barely standing to ready for battle. It was obvious for the old woman that the boy was almost expecting to be attacked, and by the slight bulge behind his left shoulder it seemed he carried a weapon. Most likely a sword for the shape of the bulge. The Amazon elder was more than glad to be her that dealt with this particular business. She didn't feel like burying another of her descendants prematurely. Cologne's senses were screaming danger at her by just looking at the young man.<p>-<p>"This one is perfect. It has all we're looking for." Hinako said with a smile and walked out. It seemed like going to that cafe had been a good idea. Not only did they get a chance to relax and eat something, but the next house they found fit their needs perfectly. It helped a lot that it was very close to both Furinkan High and the cafe they had a refreshment at.<p>Aeris was smiling as well. Over at last. While it was fun to hang out with Hinako and Ranma it would be better if they weren't looking for a house and were instead having fun.<p>Ranma didn't comment, instead he finished studying the house and saw it would be easy to defend should an attack occur. Only two doorways into it, with few windows and small ones at that. It also seemed sturdy enough to withstand some pretty hard blows.<p>The teacher wrote the phone number down and turned to her companions. "Where should we go now? We have the rest of the day free."<p>"Don't you want to see other houses?"<p>Hinako shook her head. "This one is the best we've come across so far, and it's close to the school."<p>Aeris and Ranma looked at each other before shrugging.<p>"Today's youth. Always taking decisions without consideration." A fourth voice was heard, female and somewhat raspy.<p>Before Hinako could blink both Ranma and Aeris were in ready positions, the girl assuming a low stance and the man reaching under his trench-coat but not quite taking out the sword. She followed their serious gazes and caught sight of a very old woman; she seemed as old as Happosai, balancing herself on a staff only a few feet away.<p>Cologne did her best to remain impassive. While the girl seemed like a competent martial artist she was no challenge at all for three thousand years of Amazon history. The slightly older woman was no threat at all, except for a rather strong aura being emitted by her, since she seemed to have no formal training in martial arts. But those two were not the ones to make the elder almost soil herself. When the pigtailed man turned at the ready, glaring at her with those blue-green orbs, Cologne's senses screamed danger at her so loud she had trouble keeping her balance. It was only because she was very experienced that she hid this reaction from the trio.<p>Instead of that the elder Amazon chuckled in fake mirth, a raspy sound coming out of her mouth, and continued with what she was saying. "You should probably wait a little more to pick a house, child. Such a decision shouldn't be taken lightly."<p>While Ranma and Aeris remained unmoving, closely studying all they could about the old woman, the teacher smiled. "We don't have much time to pick a house. If it fits our needs then I can pay for it."<p>Cologne didn't pursue the matter and turned her attention to Ranma. "Is there a problem, young man?"<p>"Who are you?" Ranma asked coldly. This woman had sneaked up on them and the pigtailed man had bad experiences with people that did that.<p>Cologne sobered instantly. "Perhaps we should talk in a more suitable place?"<p>-<p>"NO WAY!" Akane bellowed.<p>"Akane, please be reasonable." Soun pleaded, the glare he was receiving from his youngest daughter making him flinch.<p>The girl crossed her arms over her chest. "I said no. That perverted monster attacked Kasumi! He's lucky I haven't found him yet."<p>Soun sighed deeply. "Akane, your sister told us Genma's son didn't attack her. It was all a misunderstanding." The man was starting to get desperate. If he didn't convince Akane to allow Ranma back to the dojo the schools might never be joined. He knew perfectly well Akane wouldn't be the right choice, but Kasumi seemed to have feelings for the pigtailed man.<p>Akane shook her head vehemently. "I was there! I remember the expression on Kasumi's face!" She pointedly glared at Soun. "If you accept him in this house I'll leave."<p>Soun slumped against a wall in defeat and nodded weakly. Akane nodded and walked out of the dojo, an annoyed but somewhat satisfied expression on her face. She ignored Nabiki, who was leaning against the doorframe, on her way out. For a couple of days Nabiki had been giving her sister the cold shoulder. Two could play the same game.<p>Once Akane was gone Nabiki smirked without mirth. "Having trouble with the spoiled princess?" Oh yes, Nabiki was having a great time seeing her father suffer the consequences of his actions in spoiling the princess. She was still mighty upset over the confrontation they had and her anger would take a long time to cool down.<p>Soun flinched at the ice in Nabiki's voice and turned to her. "Daughter, regardless of what you think of me she's still your sister. And I'm still your father."<p>Nabiki shrugged and walked back into the house. She wanted to talk to Kasumi about what to do with their new houseguest. Aside from that Kasumi asked if they could talk in her room later in the day, she had to wonder what her older sister wanted.<p>The dismissal hurt Soun a lot more than the most insulting of words. He'd lost his daughter's respect with his actions, and few things could hurt more than that.<p>-<p>Aeris stared suspiciously at Cologne after the elder finished explaining who she was and why she was here. After their meeting outside the house they walked to a park Ranma noticed earlier in the day to talk.<p>Cologne explained how she was the great grandmother of the purple-haired Amazon that tried to attack Hinako. She was fast to add Shampoo was following their laws and not acting like she did out of enjoyment. The elder was very upset to learn of the injured ones in the mall, something that her great granddaughter omitted in her letter. More than likely because she didn't notice. Shampoo could be oblivious to things when focused on a task.<p>Ranma was no longer glaring at Cologne, though he was staring at her cautiously. The elder Amazon couldn't fault him for that.<p>Cologne also explained what really happened in China. A panda and a young man entered the village during the annual tournament of the tribe. While the fights took place the young man, namely Ranma, remained oblivious to everything around him. The panda, on the other hand, ate the first prize of the tournament.<p>This obviously didn't make the champion very happy. The panda, upon noticing the sword in Shampoo's hand, panicked and tried to run away. After a rather long chase they finally caught it. Ranma remained unresponsive as the guards kept him in custody.<p>Thankfully for Genma one of the elders of the village, Cologne, was aware of the springs of Jusenkyo and spoke to the guide while the tournament was taking place. She reverted Genma's curse before Shampoo got herself a panda rug.<p>Upon being confronted with what he had done Genma offered his worthless son in exchange for his own freedom. While Shampoo wanted to refuse the offer of a weak male that didn't seem to be alive except for the fact he was breathing Cologne took the man's offer immediately.<p>Cologne nodded at the memory. "Ranma was the best slave any Amazon could hope for. Strong as a dozen men, silent and obedient. He worked with us for two weeks before being taken away." The elder frowned. "The guards reported a big black and while blur before being knocked out."<p>Ranma nodded, repulsed by what he'd learned of his father. As if it wasn't bad enough the way he was treated back in Nerima...<p>"Anyway..." Cologne continued. "... After you disappeared Shampoo was given the task of finding you and bringing you back to the Amazon village. But not before I gave her a warning."<p>Hinako blinked. "A warning?"<p>The elder nodded. "That should Ranma here be back to his senses she was to contact me and do nothing." She sighed. "It obviously went over her head, thinking she could take care of things by herself. Youth these days..." She finished with a grumble.<p>Aeris continued to look at Cologne with distrust. "So now what?"<p>Cologne stared at Aeris passively. "Ranma is Amazon property according to our laws. The very fact that he was taken from the village by that panda weights heavily on Shampoo's honor." The elder was expecting the glares directed her way by Aeris and Hinako, though she was somewhat intrigued by the lack of response from the pigtailed man. Before any of the girls could say anything she continued. "I'm aware of how awkward his must be for you, child. I'm sure something can be done to satisfy all parties involved."<p>Ranma continued to stare at Cologne, a curious look on his face, without a word. It was almost as if the elder's words had no effect on him, but instead he was interested in something else.<p>Hinako didn't remain silent, though. While she was intrigued by this Amazon village in China and their laws there was no way in hell she was letting them take Ranma away like this. "What would you suggest, elder?"<p>Cologne didn't miss the possessive behavior Hinako was showing, neither the hostility, and frowned. "I would be more respectful to my elders if I were you, child."<p>The hidden threat did nothing to make the teacher back down, but unfortunately for Cologne it did make Ranma react. "Are you done?"<p>Ranma's cold tone of voice made Cologne realize Hinako's feelings for the pigtailed man, if the possessiveness was the result of her feelings and not of something else, were returned by the pigtailed man. Even if those feelings still weren't fully developed they were there, and the elder erred in her approach because of her pride. She let Hinako's impertinence get the better of her, and given the glare Ranma was giving her she quite possibly alienated the pigtailed man.<p>The approach she had planned included subtly giving Ranma the idea that while he was taken as a slave in the village it was actually to protect him from his worthless father, an honorable cause. It would've worked wonders too, since Ranma didn't seem to remember what really happened, but the roundabout approach wouldn't work now that Ranma was on-guard against her. A more direct approach was too dangerous to try. The elder cursed inwardly at the presence of the two girls, who ruined her plans. A man as strong as Ranma belonged in the Amazon village siring strong children and knowing his place.<p>"Let's go." Ranma said, offering his arm for Hinako to take. When Cologne didn't answer his question for a couple of seconds he decided to leave, thinking the argument was over. Hinako took the offered arm and walked away with him, but not without giving Cologne a last cautious look.<p>Aeris, on the other hand, glared at the elder for a moment before running after the couple.<p>Cologne remained silent, fuming at the way both her plans failed and she was treated. "This is not over." She promised before bounding away. The matter about Shampoo's husband required her attention.<p>END PART 9<p>Author's notes: This chapter is mostly setup for the future. Ranma, Hinako and Aeris will be moving to Juuban and Hinako will start teaching there. Cologne makes an appearance at last, and the first confrontation didn't go as planned.<p>In the next chapter Nabiki takes a drastic decision when she talks to Kasumi, Cologne meets with the Tendos and there's trouble at Juuban.
