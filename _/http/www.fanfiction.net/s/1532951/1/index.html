</div>Catty heritage<p>Author: Poly<p>Authors note:<br/>This is another crossover, at least there are elements used from another<br/>anime. I'm not saying which one. You can guess after reading this<br/>chapter.<p>Disclaimer:<br/>All hail to the mighty Rumiko Takahashi. I'm not worthy!<p>PART I<br/>Spirit<p>There are many things unknown about the neko-ken. It's origin was<br/>forgotten in the mists of time. What was left was a distorted martial arts<br/>technique that would drive the trainee insane. Still, people sought to<br/>conquer its power, which always resulted in disaster and, oftentimes,<br/>death. Ultimately, the technique was banded and people forgot about it.<br/>However, the lure of power still attracted the occasional martial artist in<br/>search of an unbeatable technique. One such martial artist was one<br/>Genma Saotome. His goal was to make his son, Ranma, the best martial<br/>artist of his generation and an example of a man amongst man.<p>Genma stumbled upon the technique quite by accident. He stole a training<br/>manual from a temple he and his son resided at while on their training<br/>journey. In many universes Genma tried to train Ranma in the neko-ken<br/>with disastrous results. In many Ranma had ailurophobia for life. In others<br/>he tried to master it. Sometimes he succeeded and sometimes he did not.<p>In this universe, however, something else happened. A change so small<br/>that one would not notice it until pointed out. When Genma collected the<br/>cats he needed for the training, he caught a cat that was slightly different<br/>from the others. This cat had unusual ancestors. Ancestors that went back<br/>to the time demons roamed the earth freely. It was there that the true<br/>neko-ken had its origin. The neko-ken training was man's poor attempt at<br/>mimicking the powers and fighting abilities of cat demons, a fighting style<br/>that was never meant to be used by humans.<p>The cat Genma had caught had a miner cat demon as an ancestor. Its<br/>blood was so diluted that one could not detect it without considerable<br/>effort on their part. Despite that, it could not deny its origin. When young<br/>Ranma was thrown into the pit of cats and suffered the clawing and biting<br/>of the horde of cats, something happened that was unexpected: Ranma<br/>received part of the true neko-ken. It was for this reason that the young<br/>boy did not turn into an unstoppable killing machine while having<br/>subconscious control. This alone allowed an old lady to calm Ranma down<br/>when the boy escaped from the pit in his feral state.<p>Genma, who was unaware of this, saw the training as a total failure. He<br/>berated the boy about his fear of cats, calling him weak and blaming him<br/>for wasting his time. Many years passed after these events and Ranma<br/>would have lived his life, unknowing of the spiritual gift if it wasn't for one<br/>of his father's other training ideas.<p>Jusenkyo.<p>At this ancient training ground everything would change. Who could have<br/>known how Jusenkyo would react to the true neko-ken?<p>* * *<p>Ranma stared in shock at the giant panda that had emerged from the<br/>pool. The words of the guide barely registered in his mind. His thoughts<br/>were still trying to wrap themselves around the concept that his pop had<br/>turned into an animal. He was utterly unprepared for the panda leaping<br/>for an attack. A solid kick connected with his chest, which set him flying<br/>backwards. His arms flailed about in panic, knowing he would hit a pool<br/>when he landed. Time seemed to slow down and his thoughts were almost<br/>clinical. He ideally wondered what he would turn into. Something human?<br/>Or perhaps an animal as well? A twinge of fear shot through his spine. He<br/>could turn into a c-c-ca, ca-ca... one of those things.<p>It still came as a shock when the cold water enveloped him. A tingle<br/>seemed to spread throughout his entire body. He could feel his body<br/>starting to morph. The relative calm that he had when flying through the<br/>air started to leave him. He was on the verge of a real panic attack when<br/>he felt a surge of power surround him. It was like a bright white light.<br/>Ranma marveled at the feeling that enveloped him before his world went<br/>white.<p>* * *<p>"What happened?" Genma asked the guide. What came out, though, was<br/>something in the line of "Growlf?" He tried to put his hand on his mouth in<br/>shock when he heard his voice, and panicked when he noticed the big<br/>furry paw.<p>The guide tried to calm him down. His broken Japanese was barely<br/>adequate for the job. "Mister customer need calm down. We wait for other<br/>mister customer, yes?"<p>"Growlf growlf?" Came Genma's reply. The guide seemed to understand<br/>the question despite the unintelligible sounds made from the panda.<p>"Mister customer fell into pool of drowned girl. Very tragic story of girl<br/>who drowned 1500 years ago. Mister customer takes long time to surface,<br/>though. Better get long stick and drag mister customer out before drown."<p>The guide ran off quickly to get the necessary equipment before there was<br/>a pool of drowned young martial artist.<p>* * *<p>Ranma floated in a bright white space. There was awareness, yet not like<br/>in the waking world. There seemed to be a battle waging nearby. Ranma<br/>could hear howls and hisses and the voice of a girl. Fear was flooding<br/>through his mind. In the past this fear would have driven him into the<br/>neko-ken, however, this escape was not available for him now.<p>The mind is a curious thing. Ranma's subconscious, having determined<br/>that the neko-ken was somehow not available, sought other ways to<br/>escape the poignant fear. It retreated into itself until it found the escape it<br/>needed: it found the playful child Ranma was before he was tainted by the<br/>neko-ken and his father's teachings. Ranma's mind retreated into this<br/>distant state of being. The mental battle seemed to calm down and both<br/>Jusenkyo and the neko-ken merged, changing Ranma forever.<p>* * *<p>The guide huffed and puffed as he returned to the pool young mister<br/>customer had fallen into, carrying a large wooden pole with a hook at the<br/>end. Before he could reach the pool, however, the water of the pool<br/>seemed to erupt. The guide stopped his progress quickly, not wanting to<br/>be splashed by the accursed water. The Panda nearby looked somewhat<br/>relieved that his son seemed to have survived and escaped the pool. What<br/>he saw emerge did not appease him, though. The shape that had emerged<br/>had landed in front of them on all fours and in a stance that Genma found<br/>somewhat familiar.<p>The guide was rather confused and cautious. Mister customer had been in<br/>the pool a long time, yes, but the pool had never produced a cursed<br/>customer like this before. Mister customer should have turned into a<br/>regular girl, but that was not what he was looking at. The person in front<br/>of him was a girl alright, and unarguably a very cute girl at that. Long<br/>Flaming red hair framed a heart-shaped face with two, large gray-blue<br/>eyes. Even though she wore a baggy gi you could see that she had a<br/>healthy figure and was quite developed. The two cat ears on top of her<br/>head were not normal, however. Neither was the tabby cat's tail swaying<br/>behind her. The guide could not understand how the pool could have<br/>caused that.<p>The thoughts that went through Genma's head were entirely different. At<br/>first he wanted to berate his son for turning into a weak girl, but then he<br/>noticed the extra appendences. The panda's eyes went wide. Now he<br/>knew why the stance looked so familiar: the neko-ken! The panda looked<br/>around frantically before deciding that the best thing for him to do was to<br/>hightail it out of there until his son calmed down. With amazing speed for<br/>such a large animal, he ran off and left a confused and disorientated<br/>Ranma behind. The panda never noticed the bandanna-wearing boy he<br/>knocked off a cliff in his mad run.<p>The Guide shrugged his shoulders. He would explain to young mister<br/>customer about the curse and let him explain it to the other mister<br/>customer, since it was not his job to run after them. He turned towards<br/>Ranma and waited until the girl had righted herself and faced him.<p>"Mister customer follow while I explain curse, yes?"<p>The redhead tilted her head to one side and then smiled brightly. "Ok."<br/>She said cheerfully.<p>The guide blinked a couple of times in surprise. Usually new customers<br/>weren't this cheerful or bubbly after receiving their curse. He dismissed it<br/>for now and began the walk towards his hut. Once he had explained how<br/>the curses worked he could lead the young mister customer to the<br/>Amazon village. Perhaps one of the elders knew what had happened. With<br/>that out of the way, he began to walk off while motioning for the redhead<br/>to follow. Ranma just picked up her nearby pack and followed the guide,<br/>all the while looking around her as if it were the first time.<p>* * *<p>Genma rummaged through his pack in search of something to eat. He was<br/>glad to be back in his human form. It was good fortune he stumbled upon<br/>that hot spring and fell in. If that hadn't have happened, he might have<br/>never known hot water reversed the curse.<p>He gathered what meager supplies he could dig up and started to eat a<br/>cold meal. He frowned. It might be in his best interest to look for a nearby<br/>village or something. Just to spend a couple of days recuperating, of<br/>course. He would look for his ungrateful son afterwards. Besides, it was<br/>good training for the boy to spend a couple of days in the wilderness.<br/>Satisfied with his reasoning he began eating again.<p>* * *<p>The guide dumped another kettle of hot water on the young mister<br/>customer. There was still no change. The guide just didn't understand it.<br/>There were no musk nearby when mister customer had fallen into the<br/>pool. That was the only way he could think of to get a curse to lock. Now<br/>he was certain about bringing the redhead to the Amazon elders. This was<br/>a curious case, indeed.<p>"I'm sorry, mister customer. Not know why curse not reverse. Perhaps<br/>Amazon elders can help. We will go to village tomorrow, yes?"<p>Ranma just nodded and yawned. She was getting tired and she didn't like<br/>getting wet, and was glad she wouldn't get those kettles of water dumped<br/>all over her again.<br/>She didn't really understand what the guide was talking about. She knew<br/>there was something different about her, but it didn't have her concerned.<br/>Why? She didn't know. It was just a feeling of duality: there was some<br/>part of her that was different. She shrugged it off. There were much more<br/>exciting things to do anyway, such as chasing after butterflies and playing<br/>amidst the trees. She was too sleepy for that now, though.<p>"I'm sleepy." She said tiredly. "Can we talk about this tomorrow?"<p>The guide just nodded and showed the girl a place she could sleep.<p>* * *<p>The next morning Ranma-chan was awakened by the early morning sun<br/>as it casted its rays through a small window of the hut. She yawned lazily<br/>and stretched. Her cat ears twitched as they took in the sounds of the<br/>early morning. With subtle grace, she stood up and went outside wearing<br/>nothing but a pair of boxers and a muscle shirt while soaking up the<br/>morning sun and noticing the morning dew glistening on the grass.<br/>Ranma-chan yawned again and looked around her curiously. Perhaps she<br/>could practice a kata or two? The guide wouldn't be awake to play with yet<br/>anyway. Walking a short distance to get some room, she started on her<br/>complicated dance. Movements flowed and intertwined with apparent<br/>grace. She engrossed herself into the motion with closed eyes and allowed<br/>her mind drift.<p>When she finally winded down and opened her eyes, the sun had climbed<br/>the sky and nearly an hour had passed. She was slightly sweaty from her<br/>workout as well. Looking for a place to freshen up, she walked towards a<br/>barrel of clean rain water that was placed to the side of the guides hut.<br/>Placing her hands on the side of the barrel, she bent forwards and stared<br/>into the motionless water. Her reflection stared back. She cocked her head<br/>sideways and took her first good look at herself after the incident<br/>yesterday. The strange feeling of duality surfaced once more. She had the<br/>feeling there was something different, but couldn't comprehend the<br/>significance of it.<p>Ranma-chan pulled down a lock of fiery red hair and looked at it intently<br/>and soon a memory was wrestling itself to the surface, a memory of red<br/>hair, only it darker than her own. There was a feeling of warmth and love<br/>accompanying it, so she struggled to remember more. There was a blurry<br/>image that emerged, that of a face not unlike her own. She tried to get a<br/>clearer picture and strained for several seconds towards that goal. All of a<br/>sudden it sprang into place and she whispered a single word.<p>"Mother."<p>There was a distant look in her eyes for several minutes. When she<br/>snapped out of it, she splashed herself with some of the rainwater in the<br/>barrel to freshen up. Afterwards, there was a new determination burning<br/>in her eyes. She had a mission now; one she intended to accomplish no<br/>matter what: finding her mother.<p>Finishing her morning wash, she entered the hut again. The guide was still<br/>snoring in a corner on a cot. After making her way to her pack, she<br/>searched for something to wear. The gi she was wearing yesterday had<br/>seen better days and was more brown than white from all the dirt, so she<br/>needed something clean to wear. Digging into her pack further, she finally<br/>pulled out a red Chinese shirt and black kung fu pants. She smiled,<br/>knowing that those would do nicely.<p>* * *<p>Genma grunted and hefted his pack on his shoulders. There should be a<br/>trail nearby, he thought. If he followed that it should lead him to more<br/>populated areas and, more importantly, a lot of food. The guide had<br/>mentioned a village less than a days travel from here, though he couldn't<br/>remember where. The guide had been babbling about Amazon's and<br/>female warriors or something like that. As if he cared. No women could be<br/>good at the art, let alone be a warrior. Shifting his pack in a more<br/>comfortable position, he began walking again. He had only walked a<br/>couple of meters when he was suddenly doused with a splash of cold<br/>water from one of the trees where rainwater had gathered.<p>Genma grumbled and adjusted the straps of his pack to suit his larger<br/>form.<p>* * *<p>END PART I<p>Additional authors note:<br/>I'm not sure when the next chapter will be finished. It depends on how<br/>much time I have. I want to finish 'Just A plan" first before I throw myself<br/>at this fic. (jap is nearing it's completion, so don't worry.) In the next<br/>chapter Ranma-chan will start her journey in search of her mother.
