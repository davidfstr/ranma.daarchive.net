</div><p><b>The Heart  Sutra</b></p><p>A Ranma 1/2  Fanfic</p><p>By Ashoka Roque</p><p>Disclaimer: These characters, with the exception of Ti Xiu, belong  to Rumiko Takahashi, not me. While I have put them in situations that diverge  somewhat from the original storyline, I have done so with intent to avoid  compromising the integrity of her work.   I make no profit from this story.   The character of Ti Xiu is my own creation</p><p>Warning: PG. Slightly harsh language</p><p><b>Chapter one: Introductions</b></p><p><i>"Kawaiiiiii!"</i></p><p>Tendo Akane stopped in her tracks, and turned around slowly.  Realizing that Kiko-chan was no longer  walking beside her, she began looking for the source of her friend's excitement.  She soon spotted her schoolmate in front of a nearby shop window, pointing  excitedly at the display within.  Akane  walked over behind her, got up on tiptoes and peered into the large glass  window.</p><p>"What's all the excitement about, Kiko-chan?"</p><p>"<i>Kawaii, kawaii!</i> Have you EVER seen anything so cute,  Akane-chan?"</p><p>The shelves of the store's display window were packed end-to-end  with dozens of little stuffed pigs.  Row  after row of them.  Looking at the small  black toys, Akane was slightly stunned.   These looked disturbingly familiar!</p><p>Turning to Kiko, Akane asked, "What exactly are...those,  Kiko-chan?"</p><p>Kiko looked at Akane as if she had just asked what planet they  were on. "Akane-chan, you don't mean to tell me you don't recognize  Piggachu?"</p><p>"Pigg..a..chu?" repeated Akane, wrapping her mouth  around the word unpleasantly. Before she could ask Kiko for any further  information, her excited friend had rushed into the store, which was  surprisingly crowded this early in the day.</p><p>Waiting outside, Akane listened to the chattering customers  queuing up to enter the shop, which was becoming more crowded by the  moment.  From what she overheard, it  seemed that Piggachu was the latest craze in TV Tokyo cartoon characters - apparently  from a show called "Pokeepals."</p><p>"Stupid anime merchandising..." muttered Akane under her  breath. Brandi Toy Company had become quite agressive in recent years when it  came to marketing anime-themed products. "Though I have to admit, they are  kinda cute."</p><p>After what seemed like way too long to Akane, Kiko emerged with  her new acquisition. Akane was surprised to see that in her excitement, Kiko  hadn't even allowed the clerk to wrap her purchase.</p><p>"Oh, Piggachu, Piggachu, I love you!  You can join Cattachu, Duckkachu, Squiddachu  and all your friends in my room tonight. I just gotta have 'em all!"</p><p>Akane winced.  Kiko looked  up from her new toy, "Oh Akane-chan, just hold him. Isn't he  adorable?"</p><p>"He looks an awful lot like my pet pig, P-chan," said  Akane, reluctantly taking the toy from her friend. "In fact, if you put a  bandana on his neck, they would be hard to tell apart."  Looking more closely at the toy, Akane  nodded.  It had the typical shoddy  workmanship of all mass-produced toys.   She gave it a not-so-gentle squeeze, just as an experiment.</p><p>"Kweee..."</p><p>Akane blanched, "You don't say - it makes a noise, too?"</p><p>Kiko reached back for her prize, "Oh, Akane-chan, you HAVE to  agree that he is sooo cute!"</p><p>"Yes..." agreed Akane, thinking to herself <i>I have a real  pet, and he is much nicer being 100-percent real piglet.</i></p><p>"Come on, Kiko-chan," said Akane, gently grabbing her  friend's arm, "We'll be late for school if we don't hurry."</p><p>As they rushed down the street, Akane could not shake the nagging  feeling that too many Piggachus were somehow not a good thing.</p><p>Hibiki Ryouga walked alone on the dusty road, under the cloudy  morning sky, not quite certain of where he was.</p><p>An all-too-familiar scene.</p><p>They called him "Lost Boy"...among other things.  And Ryouga knew how well the name fit.  He never hated himself more then when he was  thoroughly, utterly lost.  And he had  spent almost half of his life thoroughly and utterly lost.</p><p>His only real home was his backpack. <i>Like some demented  turtle...</i> thought Ryouga, bitterly.  It and his extremely heavy umbrella - deceptively appearing to be  fashioned from common bamboo - were his only worldly possessions.  What family he had was as perpetually lost  as he was; years might go by before he saw any of them. For so much of his life,  he had himself as his only companion - a companion he hated so much of the  time.</p><p>But it  looked like he might be gaining another companion, at least temporarily.  Ryouga was quickly catching up to an older  man in saffron-colored monk's robes, walking the same road just a dozen meters  ahead of him.  When he was almost close  enough to touch the monk, Ryouga coughed quietly to clear the dust from his  throat.</p><p>"Excuse  me, sensei.  Would you happen to know  the way to Nerima?"</p><p>Looking over  his shoulder at Ryouga, the monk answered with a gentle smile. "I happen  to be going that way myself." His Japanese was ever so slightly  accented.  "I am Ti Xiu, humble  adherent to the way of the Tatagatha Buddha."</p><p>Ryouga  blushed, realizing he had forgotten his manners after all those weeks alone on  the road. "Forgive my rudeness, sensei - I am Hibiki Ryouga. I would be  grateful if I could travel alongside you until we reach the city. How far is  it?"</p><p>Ti Xiu  looked carefully, consideringly, at Ryouga for a few moments. The youth  appeared to be around seventeen years old.   His somewhat long black hair was done up with a leopard-print bandana,  keeping it out of his large, liquid brown eyes. <i>Ah..</i> thought Ti, <i>it  is there for anyone to see, that it is, in this one...</i></p><p>"Hmmm...  yes, my child, I also think it best if you let me lead you. Nerima is but a few  kilometers away, over the hill just there."</p><p>Ryouga  gratefully fell into step just next to the monk, slightly bowing a 'thank-you'  to him.  As they walked side-by-side,  Ryouga took the opportunity to unobtrusively consider his new traveling  companion.  The man was small, the top  of his head only reaching to the mid-point of the boy's chest. Balding.  The Buddhist rosary around his neck had the  look of cherry wood, and his round glasses were wired in gold.  He seemed to give off a sensation of peace  and calm, the same way a boulder might radiate the day's saved heat on a summer  evening. Ryouga felt himself relaxing more than he had in quite some time.  Well, the fact that he knew where he was  going surely had something to do with that.</p><p>Lost in  thought, Ryouga failed to feel the first cold raindrops hit his shoulder. It  dawned on him a few moments later. <i>Oh, shit!</i> he thought, the calm  feeling quickly draining from his body, <i>I can't let myself get wet...</i></p><p>Almost  before he could even think of reaching for the umbrella on his backpack, he  felt the weight of it easing from his shoulders.  Looking up, he saw that it was already open, protecting him.  The motion had been so quick, so fluid that  it was almost imperceptible.  Ryouga's  feelings instantly flowed from panic, to relief, to puzzlement.</p><p>"A  thousand pardons, Hibiki-kun..." the old monk said, turning to Ryouga with  a small, apologetic smile, "But something gives me the feeling that you  would like to avoid getting wet. I myself, as a follower of the path, live with  the elements as they come. Sadly, this means I do not own an umbrella.  I hope you do not mind that I borrowed  yours?"</p><p>Ryouga was  speechless. There was no way that this old man could even lift his umbrella,  much less handle it so smoothly. It was almost hard to decide what was more  shocking - the old man's strength and skill, or the fact that he somehow seemed  to know about Ryouga's curse.</p><p>"Uhm...well...of  course, of course. Thank you, Ti-sensei."</p><p>"No  worries, Hibiki-kun.  We will be to  Nerima before you know it."</p><p>Ryouga's  only response - the only response possible - was to nod slowly and continue  walking down the road.  The old monk  walked alongside him, covering the boy with his own umbrella.</p><p>"Boy!"  Saotome Genma howled, as he lunged across the terra-cotta roof of the Tendo  family dojo, "You will learn to obey your father!"</p><p>"You  have to catch me first, old man," taunted Saotome Ranma, as he lightly  skipped across the peak of the roof, planted both feet, then leaped over to the  roof of the adjacent building.  Moving  eastward into the rising sun, he was momentarily lost to his father's sight.</p><p>As he  squinted into the sun, Genma felt a movement behind him.</p><p>"Oh-ho!  Think you can use the Anything-Goes-School Ultimate Double-Back technique on  me, do you?" said Genma, as he spun around, right hand barely missing its  grab for Ranma's leg.</p><p>The sparing  and the taunts went on for almost an hour, before a voice interrupted the  morning workout.</p><p>"Genma-san!  Ranma-kun! Get ready for breakfast!"</p><p>"Coming,  Kasumi!" both Saotomes chimed together, in chorus.</p><p>Soaking  together in the hot tub, after washing off the sweat and grime of the morning's  exercise, the elder Saotome lifted the moist cloth from the top of his head and  turned to his son.</p><p>"Ranma,  I am well known to all for my patience and compassion..."</p><p>Ranma looked  at his father suspiciously, out of the corner of his eyes.</p><p>"And I  know things have been difficult for you..."</p><p>"Um, Pop..."  began Ranma.</p><p>"SILENCE!"  shouted Genma, "I am giving you compassionate, understanding fatherly  counsel as recommended by TV Tokyo Sensei Oh Praw Wen Free, and I demand 100%  attention as I pour out my heart to you!"   Tears streamed freely down both sides of Genma's face.</p><p>Ranma's  mouth closed with an audible 'snap'.</p><p>"You  see, son," continued Genma, lifting his left hand to scratch the back of  his head, "Tendo-kun and I realize that your...condition...has made things  difficult for you and Akane-chan.  At  first, well, Tendo-kun was afraid that the whole thing was just too  hentai.  But being a modern father, I  persuaded him that it was best that we adapt to the situation, give you both  some time and see how the two of you worked things out between yourselves."</p><p>Ranma  starred at his father for a few moments of uncomfortable silence.</p><p>"Well,  anyway..." continued Genma, "Now that you and Akane-chan have settled  things between you, Tendo-kun and I agree that the wedding needs to happen  now."</p><p>"WHAT!"  yelled Ranma, standing up.  (Any view of  his private parts conveniently blocked by the bath bucket perched on the edge  of the tub.) "What have we worked out? She still hates boys, and I still  say she is the most un-cute girl I have ever seen!"</p><p>"Oh, I  know, I know," replied Genma, "But you see, she seems to have adapted  to your unmanly curse quite well."</p><p>"What  does that have to do with anything?"</p><p>"Well,  son, the remaining problems between the two of you are the same as between most  any couple. You don't like her, she doesn't like you - perfectly normal!"  Genma beamed at his son. "Sometimes you are male, sometimes you are female  - that's not normal. But if the two of you can deal with that, a little mutual  loathing is no excuse to delay your wedding any longer."</p><p>Ranma's face  grew red, and he clenched his teeth together. When he spoke, only his lips  moved - "Perhaps that type of marriage was fine for you and Mom - how  often have you actually seen her in the past seventeen years? But that is NOT  the type of marriage I will live with, no matter how much you or any of a  hundred fiancees may try to bully me."</p><p>"RANMA!"  yelled Genma, standing up in the tub.   (Any view of -his- private parts conveniently blocked by the rubber  ducky perched on the edge of the tub...thank goodness for small favors!)  "Duty to family comes first, before any  personal desires we might have.  And for  all that it matters, your family consists of ME at this moment. I will no  longer be disobeyed. You will be a man, and you will marry Tendo Akane - one  month from today!"</p><p>"You  will DIE first!" screamed Ranma.   Quickly wrapping a towel around his waist, he ran from the bathroom,  howling incoherently.</p><p><i>Hmm, I think  that went rather well! Good old Oh Praw... </i>Genma smiled, as he sank back down into the tub, replaced the  moist towel on his head, and began a well-deserved long soak.</p><p>Continued  in Chapter Two: Itadakimasu!</p><p>C&amp;C  welcome -</p>
