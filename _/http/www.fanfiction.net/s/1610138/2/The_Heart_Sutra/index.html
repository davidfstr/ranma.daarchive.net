</div><p><b>The Heart  Sutra</b></p><p>A Ranma 1/2  Fanfic</p><p>By Ashoka Roque</p><p>Disclaimer: These characters, with the exception of Ti Xiu, belong  to Rumiko Takahashi, not me. While I have put them in situations that diverge  somewhat from the original storyline, I have done so with intent to avoid  compromising the integrity of her work.   I make no profit from this story.   The character of Ti Xiu is my own creation</p><p>Warning: PG. Slightly harsh language</p><p><b>Chapter Two:  Itadakimasu!</b></p><p>Ranma  arrived at school only slightly late that morning.  At lunchtime, he ran into Akane and the middle Tendo daughter,  Nabiki.</p><p>"What's  up with the stuffed pigs?" asked Ranma. "It's like I'm drowning in a  sea of P-chans."</p><p>"It's  those stupid Piggachus," replied Akane.   "Almost all the girls have at least one, and even a few of the guys  are carrying them around."</p><p>"Hmm -  I bet this would really freak out Ryouga!"</p><p>"Ryouga-kun?"  said Akane, dully. "Why would he care?"</p><p>Nabiki's  face was glazed over in a look of lustful greed. "Brilliant..." she  whispered, admiringly, "Absolutely f'ing brilliant! They must be making a  fortune..."</p><p>Both Akane  and Ranma shook their heads, and looked away. It was obviously useless trying  to engage Nabiki in any type of rational conversation when she was in this  state.</p><p>"Well,  enjoy your last month of freedom..." said Ranma to Akane, as he started to  head towards the lunch counter line.</p><p>"And  just what is that supposed to mean?" snapped Akane.</p><p>"I  mean  - enjoy the last month before our  wedding.  Once we're married, you are  definitely starting the bridal training crash course. And I am sure it will be  taking up all of your free time. I may not want to be married, but I don't want  to get out of it by dying from your cooking."</p><p>"RANMA!"  screamed Akane, her head somehow appearing to grow until it was almost three  times the size of the rest of her body. "What have you done now, you total  baka!"</p><p>A single,  very large bead of sweat began to run down Ranma's face. "Didn't your  father tell you?"</p><p>"Don't  you 'your father' me! I know this your fault! Just get me married, stuck at  home, out of your way, and you will go wandering around, enjoying  yourself!" Akane was panting with anger.   "You will never get away with it!"</p><p>"As if  I would marry you under any circumstances, unless I was forced to!  Who wants to marry an un-cute, tomboy,  flat-chested, bulldyke..."</p><p><b><i>SLAP!</i></b></p><p>The sound  echoed down the halls of the school, out into the courtyard, and across the  previously peaceful fields of Nerima.</p><p>Ranma  arrived at the Tendo dojo just before dinnertime, a large red handprint still  clearly visible on the left side of his face.   The evening was to be a festive occasion. The proud fathers, wishing to  announce the upcoming marriage date, had invited Dr. Tofu, one of the town's  most respected citizens, to witness the happy event - and to provide any  medical attention that might be needed.   Room for two more guests was made at the Tendo family table when Dr.  Tofu arrived with a welcome Hibiki Ryouga and a foreign monk.</p><p>While the  eldest Tendo daughter was finishing meal preparations, Dr. Tofu introduced his  guest.</p><p>"Everyone,  this is Master Ti Xiu.  I studied with  him briefly many years ago. He will be staying at the clinic while he is in  town."</p><p>Introductions  were made all around.  Ranma noticed  that the man seemed to be so calm, so centered. And, over the course of the  evening, talk of the upcoming marriage seemed to be forgotten as an air of serenity  filled the atmosphere around the Tendo family dinner table.</p><p>Only two  minor incidents broke the feeling of calm companionship that night. Ranma  noticed the slightest shadow cross the monk's face when Haposai bounced by with  his most recent haul of ladies undergarments. And, of course, after Kasumi  entered with the evening meal, the suddenly-uncoordinated Dr. Tofu caused minor  destruction at almost every opportunity.    When he spilled a pitcher of icewater on Genma, promptly changing him  into a panda, Ti Xiu did not blink an eye.   It was only later, when Tofu almost scalded himself in a most  embarrassing place with very hot tea, that Ti Xiu broke the serene mood.</p><p>"Tofu-kun,  just ask the girl to go out with you. I'm sure she would."</p><p>Under more  usual circumstances, this comment might have resulted in an energetic response  from those around the table. But in the relaxed atmosphere of this particular  evening, the main reaction was amusement and curiosity.  Ranma and the others waited to see what  would happen next.</p><p>"I,  uh..." sputtered Dr. Tofu, "I just don't know what you mean,  Ti-sensei."</p><p>"A  thousand pardons to everyone for my horrible lack of manners," continued  Ti Xiu, "but compassion compels in certain circumstances. I am so used to  dealing with those under curses, I sometimes forget myself."</p><p>There was a  general murmur around the table. "Curses? Did he say curses?"</p><p>"I  suppose I should explain myself," continued Ti Xiu. "I am here in Nerima  because of the horrible concentration of cursed individuals and families in the  area.  Why, around this very table,  almost all of you are affected!"</p><p>Ranma griped  the edge of the table.  "Are you  talking about the Jushenko springs?"</p><p>"In a  way," said Ti Xiu, somewhat evasively, "But it goes beyond  that."</p><p>The monk  turned to Dr. Tofu. "Tofu-kun, my old student, the men in your family  suffer from a curse rendering you all incompetent boobs around women you  like.  No matter how competent you are  otherwise, you become a blithering idiot, until you actually express yourself  and allow your relationship to grow.   Your father was the same way."</p><p>Dr. Tofu  turned red.  His nose turned red, his  ears turned red - Ranma blinked - - were his glasses even turning red?</p><p>"Hibiki-kun,"  continued Ti Xiu, "My new friend. You at least have the advantage of  knowing your curse - that of absolutely no sense of direction."</p><p>Ryouga  tensed, then relaxed.  At least it  seemed as if the monk was not going to reveal the secret of P-Chan to  Akane.</p><p>"Tendo-san,  my dear host," Ti went on, "If you will forgive the unforgivable  rudeness of an old man, most of your family suffers from a curse that renders  them blind to certain obvious facts about themselves and those close to  them."</p><p>"I'll  say,"  said Ranma, stuffing a whole  raw squid into his mouth.</p><p>Later that  evening, Ranma and Ryouga were soaking in the tub. The serenity of the evening  had taken the edge off of their normally difficult relationship, and the two  had even shared a small joke. They were laughing together as Ti Xiu entered the  room to use the Tendo spa for his evening bathing, as Dr. Tofu's clinic could  not boast a nice warm hot-tub. As he cleaned the dirt of the road from his  body, both boys got out of the tub to towel off, allowing the older guest  respectful space for his soak.  Neither  of them could help noticing that the old monk was in very good shape - probably  even more so that either the elder Tendo or the elder Saotome, both of who were  many, many years younger.</p><p>As Ti Xiu  soaked in the tub, the boys sat down on the edge, towels wrapped around waists.</p><p>"Uh ...  Ti-sensei?" began Ranma, hesitantly.</p><p>"Yes,  son.." replied the monk.</p><p>"When  you mentioned curses, I was sure you were going to talk about the Jushenko  Springs. But you didn't."</p><p>"No,  that I did not," replied Ti Xiu, "For a very good reason."</p><p>Both boys  leaned in closer, over the tub. "Why not, Ti-sensei?" asked Ryouga.</p><p>"Because  those springs are not exactly cursed, you see."</p><p>"WHA?"  cried both boys, in chorus.</p><p>"Oh, I  know you both have been effected by them - - as well as half the folks in this  town, or so it seems. You must have chartered a summer tour to Jushenko,  neh?"  Ti smiled slightly at his  own joke.</p><p>"But,"  said Ranma, perplexed, "How can you say they aren't cursed. I fell into a  random spring, and now I turn into a girl when doused with cold water.  My dad fell into a random spring, and now he  turns into a panda."</p><p>"And I  turn into a pig as the result of being PUSHED into a random spring..."  concluded Ryouga, resulting in a glare from Ranma.</p><p>"My  sons..." said Ti, "What you say is true, from your limited point of  view. But nothing in life is random, and those springs are only cursed in that  they force all who fall into them to deal with the challenge of a transformation.  My monastery has dealt with those springs  for over 3,000 years of Chinese history.   Today, they are called the Cursed Springs. In times past, they were  known as the Blessed Springs."</p><p>Both boys  facefaulted. Ranma turned to Ryouga - "You gotta be kidding me!"</p><p>But Ryouga,  perhaps having developed a little more respect for the monk after the incident  on the road, recovered quickly from his shock. "Please, sensei, tell me  ... tell us, how could the springs be considered blessed?"</p><p>Ti Xiu  nodded approvingly. "Remember when I said that nothing in life is  random?  Those who fall into a spring  don't just fall into _any_ spring.  That  fall into the spring that changes them to the form best suited to them. The  form that can most rapidly help them develop their whole being."</p><p>Ryouga left  to make his bedroll in the dojo training room, apparently needing time to  digest what the strange monk had said.   But as Ranma was leaving, Ti Xiu asked him to stay for a moment longer.</p><p>"Ranma-kun,  I hear that congratulations are in order. Akane-chan will certainly make a most  lovely bride."</p><p>Ranma  paused. <i>Damn!</i>  The unusual,  relaxed feeling of the evening had made him totally forget his father's  ultimatum from earlier in the day.</p><p>"Um,  well, ah..." he sputtered, unable to come up with an appropriate response.</p><p>"Ranma-kun,  is everything going well between you and Akane-chan?"</p><p><i>Oh, what  does it matter?</i>  thought Ranma, <i>I need to talk with someone, and Ti-sensei is certainly the  most trust-inspiring person, even if I have just met him.</i>  Within a matter of minutes, Ranma had  related the whole story to the attentive monk, up to and including his father's  admonishments about duty and family that very morning.</p><p>"Ah,  so..." said Ti Xiu, as Ranma finished, "These things, ~on~, duty, and  ~giri~, family honor...so important in our lives.  But, my son, these things are not just meant to constrain us -  they are a way to free us as well. You father wants what he wants for a reason.  The Heart Sutra says we must look deeply to our loved ones, and their  suffering, to find a compassionate response."</p><p>Ranma  sighed, "I know why he wants what he wants.  Are you saying I should just go through with it?"</p><p>The monk  shook his head. "No, no, my son. But by looking deeply at the suffering of  those we love, we may find ways to give them what they need while being true to  ourselves. Would it be compassionate to Akane-chan to marry her against your  own feelings? Would it be compassionate to yourself?"</p><p>"Well,  no - of course not."</p><p>"I know  you are a boy with a good heart.  Train  it, as you do your body when you prepare for a fight."  The monk smiled broadly, "Think of it  as the 'Anything Goes Heart Technique' if you will. Now, you are sleepy, I can  see. You should be off to bed - young people need much more sleep that us  elders do."</p><p>Ranma  departed for his room. After a good long soak, Ti Xiu got out of the tub.</p><p><i>One last bit  of business before I return to Tofu's.</i></p><p>Ti Xiu  followed the sound of gentle humming to the Tendo living room. Though the hour  was late, a lone, demented figure was ironing several items of women's  undergarments, delicately handling each one like a treasure.</p><p>"Ah, my  precious..." hissed Haposai, as he folded a teal-colored thong.</p><p>"Still  at it, I see..." said Ti Xiu.</p><p>"You!"  shrieked Haposai, "I thought you had left for the evening."</p><p>"I knew  you were avoiding me. Your habits continue to bring pain and suffering to  others. While I am in Nerima, I think it would be best if you were elsewhere.

Somewhat shorter, Haposai looked up at Ti  Xiu.</p><p>"I am  older now, Haposai, and in some ways not as patient as I was in my youth. A  repetition of our last meeting would not please me."</p><p>Haposai  vanished.</p><p><b>Continues in  Chaspter Three: Confrontation</b></p><p>C&amp;C  appreciated -</p>
