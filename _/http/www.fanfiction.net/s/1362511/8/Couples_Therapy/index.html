</div>Couple's Therapy<p>Pointless tales of pairing off<p>Standard Issue Disclaimer:<p>Ranma 1/2 is not mine to do with as I please. It belongs to Rumiko Takahashi and some other people whose names I don't recall. Please don't sue me!<p>-<p>CASE 7: Soun Tendo and Nodoka Saotome, OR On Honor and Obligation<p>Part 2: She's not crazy, she's just a little old fashioned<p>As she approached the door to the Tendo household, Shampoo briefly wondered if she would get out alive.<p>Last night, in a supreme state of grief and anger, Akane had leveled the Cat Cafe, blaming Shampoo for the disappearance of Ranma. Likely this was the common opinion around the Tendo home, meaning that Shampoo was probably walking right in to hostile territory.<p>It couldn't be helped though. This was something she felt she had to do.<p>(Not that she knew why of course, she just knew she had to do it. It was probably some kind of closure thing.)<p>She knocked on the wood frame of the door, took one big step to the left to get out of the immediate line of fire, then she waited.<p>The door soon slid open and Shampoo was greeted by Nodoka, who, oddly enough, wore a curious white robe. Shampoo had the vague feeling that there was some kind of significance attached to this particular garment (and for that matter the tanto in Nodoka's hand), but she couldn't for the life of her remember what it was. Some Japanese thing.<p>"Nihao," she said.<p>"Hello Shampoo," Nodoka replied. "What brings you here so early in the morning?"<p>"Shampoo wondering how Akane is doing," Shampoo said.<p>"The poor dear is sleeping right now," Nodoka said. "I am afraid she is still trying to come to grips with everything." Nodoka's hand ever so slightly tightened its grip on the tanto, though her voice remained even tempered and polite. It was a classic sign that Nodoka was displeased. "I'm afraid she still blames you for this dreadful situation."<p>Shampoo felt a cold chill, and she almost instinctively took a step back. She'd faced down some of the finest martial artists in the world without flinching. How could this woman provoke such fear in her so easily with such a simple and nondescript move? "Shampoo have nothing to do with Ranma leaving," she said defensively.<p>"You have resorted to nefarious schemes on several occasions to attempt to win my son from Akane," Nodoka pointed out. "Correct?"<p>"Nefarious is exaggeration," Shampoo offered weakly.<p>"Let's see," Nodoka said. "As I understand it, you have used bribery, extortion, hypnotic mushrooms, love potions, red strings of fate, at least once you've taken advantage of his fear of cats, another time you attempted to get him to sign a marriage license while under the influence of some sort of magic bandage. Were you not also involved in destroying my house and in the unfortunate first wedding?"<p>That did little to alleviate Shampoo's fears. She'd sort of hoped that those little incidents had been forgotten by now. She hadn't expected the Saotome matriarch to keep a list.<p>"But Shampoo really have nothing to do with this," She protested. "Shampoo give up on Ranma. He love Akane. Shampoo can tell long time now that try win him is hopeless. Ranma too stupid to know what good for him."<p>Nodoka sighed a sigh of resignation. "That may be so, unfortunately this changes nothing."<p>"That no true," Shampoo said. "Shampoo come to say that I go looking for Ranma. You tell Akane that I go find Ranma and bring him back so she can hit him back in line, okay?"<p>"That is very sweet of you, Shampoo," Nodoka said. "But why would you do this?"<p>"Like Shampoo say, Ranma is too stupid to know what good for him," Shampoo said. "Shampoo want get on with life, but no right Ranma leaving like that. Akane and Ranma make agreement to get married, so Ranma have obligation to Akane. No can just run away. Akane beat Shampoo in winning Ranma, so Shampoo fix Akane's problem. Is only proper."<p>"I'm afraid you might not be able to fix this, Shampoo," Nodoka said. "Ranma seems to have stated his feelings in no uncertain terms."<p>Shampoo shook her head. "Shampoo know better. You tell Akane is okay? Shampoo no think seeing Akane right now good idea."<p>Nodoka nodded. "I will see the message is passed on."<p>"Okay," Shampoo said. She wondered if Akane would believe her or not. It didn't really matter, but she kind of hoped she would. "Bye bye." With that, she left.<p>As she walked back, she thought back to what she had told Nodoka. She couldn't help but wonder if her motives were really as pure as she had claimed. Sure, she told herself that she was doing this to put it all behind her and get on with her life, but could it really be true?<p>Could she really say that all the old feelings wouldn't come rushing back when she finally found Ranma? Could she really say she didn't want them back?<p>After all, if she really had well and truly moved on, why had she felt obligated to exact her own little bit of revenge on her great grandmother for causing this whole thing?<p>She couldn't help but chuckle a little at the thought. All it had taken was a simple message to the right person. In a few months' time Great Grandmother would learn beyond a shadow of a doubt what it was like to have HER world turned upside down for a change!<p>But that aside, what was she really trying to accomplish in searching for Ranma? Shampoo would never have a better chance than now to win Ranma for herself. Could she really deny that a part of her couldn't help but want that?<p>Aw, who cares about her inner doubts! We've got more important ground to cover.<p>*****<p>Such a sweet girl, Nodoka decided. So young, so idealistic, so full of confidence that everything would turn out all right.<p>Oh well.<p>She headed into the kitchen, where she knew Kasumi was making breakfast. "Kasumi dear," she said.<p>Kasumi turned to face Nodoka. There was about a half second's pause as she took in Nodoka's choice of attire. "Yes Aunt Saotome?" she asked, no visible sign that she registered the significance of the white robes and tanto. "Who was at the door? It wasn't perhaps Dr Tofu was it?"<p>Nodoka shook her head. "I'm afraid not. It was Shampoo. She asked me to tell Akane that she was going to find Ranma and bring him back. Could you deliver the message for me? I'm afraid I won't be able to."<p>Kasumi nodded cheerfully. "Certainly. Are you going on a journey?"<p>Nodoka thought for a moment. "Of sorts."<p>There was another half second pause before Kasumi spoke again. "It seems a poor time to take a journey, so close to the New Year and all," she said.<p>"Nevertheless..."<p>Another pause. "Also, everyone here would miss you greatly were you to leave us."<p>"This is a matter of family honor I'm afraid," Nodoka said. "This is a journey I must undertake."<p>A significantly longer period of silence followed.<p>"Very well, if this is your wish," Kasumi finally said, perhaps ever so slightly more solemn than usual. "Shall I fetch Mr. Saotome to attend you?"<p>"Yes, thank you Kasumi. I will be in the dojo." Nodoka bowed to the eldest Tendo daughter. Kasumi returned the bow, bowing perhaps just a fraction of an inch lower and holding it for a fraction of a second longer.<p>"Goodbye Kasumi," Nodoka said. "I wish you well on your current endeavor."<p>"It really is a shame that you have to leave," Kasumi said, "though I can understand why you feel it is necessary. May the Kami watch over you."<p>There was really nothing more to be said.<p>*****<p>"Mr. Saotome," Kasumi called as she stood outside the Saotome family's room.<p>Genma Saotome awoke from a semi-blissful slumber and tried to answer Kasumi.<p>Unfortunately his words came out in a series of growls. He'd forgotten he was a panda right now.<p>"Growwl growl," he complained. Too comfortable to want to get out of bed, he tossed a sign through the doorway, which read "What can I do for you Kasumi?"<p>"Mrs. Saotome needs your assistance in the dojo," Kasumi said cheerfully.<p>Grumbling to himself, Genma dragged himself to his feet and tromped his way out of the room. He stooped to pick up the sign, flipping it over and showing the new side to Kasumi.<p>"When's breakfast?" it read.<p>"It will be another hour or so," Kasumi replied.<p>Genma nodded and walked on. He decided not to change back right now, given that there was actually very little he could do in human form that he couldn't do as a panda.<p>He tromped his way through the house and into the dojo.<p>The sight he beheld there stopped him dead in his tracks.<p>Nodoka sat kneeling in a rather plain white robe before a tray with a small dish of sake and some writing supplies on it. A tanto also lay on the tray, ready to be used.<p>"There you are, dear," she said as she caught sight of her husband. "Would you be so kind as to serve as my second? The katana is right over there."<p>She picked up a brush and began serenely writing her death haiku as Genma began to panic.<p>He frantically held up a sign. "Don't you think this is a little extreme?" it read.<p>"Now now dear," Nodoka said. "Ranma's leaving was as much my failure as yours. Certainly I won't allow you to shoulder all the blame yourself." She thought for a moment. "Of course if I do this I won't be there to act as your second when you atone, will I?"<p>Now Genma REALLY began to panic.<p>"I suppose you will have to ask Mr. Tendo to serve as your second," Nodoka decided. "Yes, that should work nicely."<p>No, Genma decided, that would most certainly NOT work nicely.<p>His mind worked furiously, trying to find a way out of this mess. Suddenly it hit him. He held up another sign.<p>"Can we put this off until I change back?" it read. "Pandas can't hold katanas."<p>Nodoka nodded. "Very well, dear. I'll wait right here while you go fetch some hot water."<p>Genma nodded and tromped out of the dojo.<p>A few moments later Nodoka heard a rather dreadful racket coming from the house. Genma returned to the dojo soon after, still in panda form.<p>"Sorry, but the tub and the faucets in the bathroom are broken," his next sign read.<p>"What was that awful sound I heard?" Nodoka asked.<p>"Mice," Genma's answering sign read. "I suppose this means we will have to put this off for a while longer."<p>"Don't be silly dear," Nodoka said. "Just get some hot water from the kitchen."<p>Genma grumbled something unintelligible. Damn this woman's persistence! Once again he turned and plodded out of the dojo, snagging the katana on the way.<p>*****<p>Kasumi was hard at work on breakfast when Genma stomped into the room, the Saotome family katana clenched expertly in his forepaws.<p>With no preamble he began wailing on the kitchen with abandon, hacking up everything that might conceivably either contain or produce hot water.<p>In short order the kitchen was a rather thorough wreck.<p>"Oh dear," Kasumi said. "That was rather uncalled for Mr. Saotome."<p>Genma held up a sign in response.<p>"So sorry," it said. "Thought I saw a fly."<p>He then realized he carried a katana in his paw and sheepishly dropped it. He held up another sign.<p>"Pandas can't hold katanas."<p>Then he cheerfully skipped out.<p>Kasumi sighed. "I do wish they could learn to settle these little matters another way."<p>*****<p>"You're sure about this, Shampoo?" Cologne asked as Shampoo packed her bag. Shampoo had decided to waste no time, and started packing as soon as she returned to the hotel.<p>"Yes, Great Grandmother," Shampoo replied in her native tongue. "I'm going to find him and bring him back."<p>"What are you trying to prove?" Mousse demanded from a corner of the room, his tone wary.<p>Shampoo shook her head. "I'm not trying to prove anything, Mousse," she said. "This is something I have to do. Ranma has to answer for what he did to Akane."<p>"Liar," Mousse said coldly. Strangely enough, there was little of the air of confident smugness he had taken on of late. "You want to take him for yourself, plain and simple."<p>"You're wrong," Shampoo said softly.<p>"Do you honestly think this changes anything!" Mousse demanded.<p>"That's enough Mousse," Cologne said. "Leave us."<p>Anger flashed across Mousse's eyes (noticeable even through his thick glasses), but he said nothing as he walked out.<p>"You understand," Colonge said once the door closed, "that if you have truly given up on Ranma, you will have to undergo re-training. There will be a stigma of dishonor over this. One not easy to remove."<p>Shampoo nodded. It was the price of acknowledging defeat at the hands of an outsider. "I don't really have a choice, do I?"<p>"Actually, you do," Cologne said. "However that choice is entirely your own to make." She produced a small bag from somewhere. "Take these with you," she said as she tossed the bag to Shampoo.<p>"What are they?" Shampoo asked.<p>"They are a herbal remedy," Cologne replied. "You still haven't quite recovered from being virtually baked alive by Akane, and traveling long distances in that state isn't good. Take those pills once a day and they will help you recover."<p>Shampoo nodded her understanding and slipped the bag into her pack.<p>"It hurts," she said softly, unsure why she said it.<p>"The burns?" Cologne asked.<p>"No," Shampoo replied.<p>"Ah..." Colonge said, understanding. "First love's always the worst. I've been alive for three hundred years and have had fifty seven lovers, but the first one is the one that always sticks in my mind. Even now after so long, even though I know what kind of man he was, and is, I can't help but occasionally think back to what might have been..."<p>Shampoo realized who her great grandmother was talking about and couldn't help but burst out in laughter.<p>"I don't know if that was quite warranted," Cologne protested.<p>"I... I'm sorry Great Grandmother," Shampoo said, still trying to restrain her chuckles. Oh boy! What might have been? If she only knew...<p>"So how do you intend to find Ranma?" Cologne asked.<p>"I don't know," Shampoo replied. "I can't begin to guess where he might go." She smiled. "Of course, this isn't the first time I've had to track him down. I'll catch up to him eventually." She grabbed her pack and slung it over her shoulder. "I'd better get going."<p>Cologne nodded. "Good luck Shampoo," she said.<p>Shampoo offered a brisk salute, then turned and left.<p>"Enjoy your herbal remedies," Cologne said once she was sure Shampoo was well away. "I've prepared the way for you, now the decision really is yours to make."<p>*****<p>Night had fallen upon Nerima (as it did at least once a day).<p>Genma sighed a panda's sigh of relief as he settled in for the night, his wife very much alive and blissfully snoring next to him. He'd definitely dodged a bullet today.<p>If there was one thing that could be counted on in this world, it was that Nodoka Saotome, once she agreed to something, never went back on her word, no matter how mundane or ordinary the agreement. In this case it meant that she would not commit seppuku until Genma changed back into a man. Even if she suspected that Genma was very well versed with the katana no matter what form he was in, she would stand by her word.<p>Of course he couldn't stay a panda forever. Even given the damage he had already done, even though he had just set Happosai loose to lay waste to every bathhouse in the Tokyo area (which Happosai was happy to do. He was quite fond of Nodoka, and he got free underwear and peeps out of it), it was only a matter of time until some hot water from some source found its way into the Tendo home. No, he needed something more permanent.<p>He needed to convince Nodoka that she had to stay alive... But how?<p>The only things she cared about in this world were her son and honor. Genma admitted ruefully that he didn't even make the list anymore (once perhaps, but not now). Her son had left, abandoning his fiancee on the night before their wedding, and as a result Nodoka's honor now compelled her to take her own life to atone for his breach of honor.<p>Wait, her honor compels her...<p>Of course!<p>*****<p>Damn her! Damn that bitch to hell!<p>Mousse lay in bed staring at the ceiling. Damn Shampoo!<p>"She'll fail," he told himself. "She'll fail and then she'll come back and start using me again. Lying bitch, pretending like your nothing like me. Why don't you just die and leave me in peace?"<p>"Do you realize that I hate you?" he said to nobody. "I hate you so much I want to break your neck. How can you make me feel like this? You're such a fucking waste and I should break your neck."<p>He lay there in silence for a few moments. When he spoke again, his voice had lost all the vitriol it had once had. Mousse struggled to keep back the tears that threatened to overwhelm him.<p>"Damnit, why do I have to love you? I hate you, I hate you and I love you. Why can't you just leave me alone?"<p>"I'm going to kill you Shampoo," he said as he felt tears streaming down his cheek. "I can't go on like this anymore. I have to kill you, only then can I be free of you. I don't want to, I love you so much, but I have to."<p>"It's the only way."<p>*****<p>Early the next morning Genma was surprised to see Kasumi out in the garden burning trash. This wasn't her usual day for it.<p>"Why good morning Mr. Saotome," she said as she caught sight of him. Genma offered a proper good morning sign in return.<p>He noticed what Kasumi had in her hand just before she dropped it into the fire.<p>"Oh my," she said in exasperation that Genma thought might be just a little feigned, "that was the last box of matches."<p>The fire briefly flared up as the flames reached the matches in the box. Kasumi shrugged.<p>"Kasumi dear," another voice called in the distance.<p>"I suppose it can't be helped," Kasumi said as she grabbed the fire bucket.<p>"Kasumi," the other voice called insistently, much closer now.<p>Kasumi doused the fire. Only then did she turn to face the new arrival. "May I help you Mrs. Saotome?"<p>Nodoka stood there, looking a little defeated in her white robe. The kettle of water she held in one hand now pretty much useless.<p>"I was hoping to borrow your fire for a moment to heat this water," she said, holding up the kettle.<p>"Oh dear," Kasumi replied. "I'm sorry."<p>"It's no problem dear," Nodoka said. "I suppose I could just build my own fire. Where are the matches?"<p>Kasumi smiled cheerfully. "I'm afraid we're all out of matches," she said.<p>"I see," Nodoka said thoughtfully. "Very well, I suppose it can wait." She bowed to Kasumi (not really giving any attention to Genma) and walked away.<p>Genma breathed a sigh of relief.<p>"Thanks for the save," his sign to Kasumi read.<p>Kasumi smiled sunnily. "Mrs. Saotome is such a sweet woman," she said.<p>Soun entered the garden, his expression was less than cheerful when he spotted Genma.<p>"Saotome, what are you still doing here?" he demanded in a low, angry voice. "Why haven't you gone after that no-account son of yours? Akane is in absolute misery!"<p>Genma gave Soun his best solemn look and held up a sign. "How am I supposed to find him?"<p>Soun didn't have an answer for that. Ranma had vanished without a trace. Nobody had a clue how to begin to find him.<p>Soun sat down on the steps with a dejected sigh. "What are we going to do, Saotome?" he asked. "It's all fallen apart and there's nothing we can do about it."<p>"Give the boy some time," Genma's answering sign read. "Perhaps he'll come back to his senses and come back on his own."<p>"Do you really believe that, Saotome?" Soun asked.<p>Genma didn't answer.<p>"That's what I thought," Soun said.<p>Genma presented another sign to him.<p>"The honor of the anything goes school must be maintained, no matter what the cost," it read. "Dear friend, no matter what happens, I'm counting on you to take care of Nodoka and do what must be done for the good of the art."<p>Soun was stunned by Genma's statement. "What do you mean by this, Saotome?" he asked, desperately confused. "You can't mean to go through with seppuku, can you?"<p>Genma remained silent as he got up and walked away. He still had a lot of work left to do.<p>And very little time in which to do it.<p>*****<p>The mountain village Shampoo had arrived at seemed peaceful enough. Actually, the peaceful splendor of the place, promising quaint village comforts to weary travelers, seemed almost like a godsend right now.<p>Shampoo had been either on a train or on the road for nearly twenty four hours now, following what little bit of a trail Ranma had left, and she was in serious need of a rest. She was exhausted!<p>Ranma had proven substantially easier to track than she had first thought he would have been. Utilizing her bubbly amazon cuteness to full advantage, Shampoo had no trouble getting information from the ticket offices at the rail station. The clerk there had told her that a young man matching Ranma's description had boarded a train heading into the mountains two days ago.<p>After arriving at the end of the line, Shampoo had started walking into the mountains, picking up more leads with exceptional ease along the way. Locals had seen a redheaded girl heading towards this village a couple days back. One girl even recounted a fearful tale of witnessing a young man changing into said redhead during a sudden downpour.<p>No, this was definitely not like Ranma at all. The last time, when she had hunted him across China, Ranma and his father had done everything they could to keep themselves relatively hidden. Now it seemed like Ranma just didn't care about that. All he was doing was running. Shampoo doubted he even consciously knew where he was going.<p>Of course, this could make things more difficult in the long run. A person who has an idea where they're going is more likely to inadvertently leave clues as to their final destination. Those who are just wandering, on the other hand... Shampoo was already two days behind Ranma. If her luck didn't hold up, she could quickly find herself totally lost without a clue as to his location.<p>Oh well, she decided as she approached a local inn. She'll worry about that later, after a good night's sleep and...<p>She stopped dead in her tracks as she entered the inn. Across the room, someone else, looking perhaps half dead, looked at her with surprise and disgust in his eyes.<p>"Shampoo," he said quietly, coldly.<p>Shampoo recovered from her surprise quickly enough. Her heart pounded like a drum. It was too soon! She wasn't ready for this yet! She did her best to steady herself before speaking.<p>"Nihao Ranma."<p>*****<p>TO BE CONTINUED!<p>Author's notes:<p>You know, I was really hoping I would get around to killing off Genma and Mousse in this chapter. There are a lot of reasons why I didn't, of course, mostly because I had covered a lot of ground as it was. When I was thinking this particular story arc out, I clearly didn't realize how much I was trying to cover in one chapter. Oh well, it means yet another extra chapter for what was originally going to be a five couple, six chapter story :)<p>I have to say that this chapter was a real joy to write. I'm not sure why, but it just was. I got into a serious Zen thing between caffeine induced migraines, a monster cold, and nights of not sleeping properly. The ideas just sort of flowed like cherry cola.<p>(Yup, the above statement is definitely a sign that I've been doing this too much lately, or that it's really late and I should be asleep.)<p>Out of necessity I'll be putting working on this story aside for a while (don't expect any new updates for at least a month, maybe more). If you haven't noticed from my rather ludicrous ramblings up above, my brain feels a little fried right now for various reasons. I've also got some other stuff that I've been putting off for some time that I have got to take care of.<p>So of course I had to leave you guys with a cliffhanger. I hope you appreciate it :)
