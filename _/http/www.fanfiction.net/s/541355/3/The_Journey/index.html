</div>Ranma always felt better having Akane next to him in bed. And he always felt good when he woke up and saw her smiling face greet him each morning. It had been something he had become accustomed to over the last year. For Ranma Akane had become the life sized version of the soft cuddly teddy bear no child could sleep right without. Ranma would always pull Akane into his arms and hold her close to him each night. The feel of her hair rubbing against his chest and the soft sounds of her breathing would be enough to put Ranma to sleep every night.<p>Ranma had been sleeping soundly in what was now Akane's and his room when his danger sense kicked in. Bolting awake Ranma saw his father standing over his bed glaring down at him. Groggily Ranma returned the glare. Right now Genma Saotome wasn't Ranma and Akane's favorite person in the world. Grabbing Ranma by his tank top Genma tossed the half awake martial artist out the window where he ended up landing in the koi pond.<p>"What was that for you baka?" a now female Ranma yelled at her father.<p>"Don't want you getting soft now that we're back in Tokyo." Genma called out the open window.<p>Akane, who was still asleep, felt the absence of Ranma and heard the noise in their room and woke up to see Genma standing by the window. Angry that her father-in-law burst into their room without bothering to knock Akane began yelling at him.<p>"Don't you ever knock old man? Now get out of my room!" Akane yelled before she hurled her pillow right at Genma's head.<p>The pillow hit Genma's head hard enough to knock him out the window and to the pond below. Akane heard the loud splash and the yelling of her currently female husband come from the pond. Imagining what Ranma would do to his baka father Akane let out a giggle before getting out of bed.<p>Akane hadn't taken a good look at her room the night before and took the time to do so as she picked out her clothing for the day. Her room hadn't changed in ten years. The yellow duck made by her mom was still on the door and would have to be updated. Fortunately the walls were a light yellow color and had some simple shelves on one side full of stuffed toys. They were nice but needed to be thinned out and put in storage. On the side of the room across from the door next to the window was a small desk that would be handy for doing schoolwork. Akane had a feeling they would be attending school again. It was the bed that needed the most changing. For starters it was barely big enough for the both of them and the bed linens needed to go. A married couple couldn't really sleep on white bunnies and pink stars on a yellow background.<p>With a soft sigh and a shake of her head Akane headed off to furoba to wash up for the morning before dressing and seeing if Kasumi needed help. If there was one thing Akane was glad she learned from Ku Lon besides Mandarin Chinese and martial arts it was better cooking skills. Ku Lon was one of the best cooks in the entire village and Akane and Ranma benefited from that skill.<p>By the time Akane walked out of her bedroom in a pair of black pants and a simple light blue Chinese shirt with matching knotted buttons with her hair pulled out of her face Nabiki was wearily heading off to the furoba. The middle Tendo daughter still had on her pajamas that consisted of a light green long sleeved button shirt like top and a pair of matching pants. Over the pajamas she wore a light cotton robe that was left open and she had her house slippers on her feet. Nabiki's hair showed signs of a restless night being shaggy and out of place. All in all Nabiki was not used to being up this early.<p>"Morning Nabiki." Akane said in a cheerful voice with a smile on her face.<p>"It's too early still." Nabiki replied groggily, "How do you do it?"<p>"You get used to being up with the sun living with the Amazons real fast." Akane explained before heading down the stairs.<p>Walking into the kitchen Akane found Kasumi preparing breakfast for the family. The eldest Tendo daughter was wearing a simple yellow dress trimmed with a white collar. Over the dress was a white apron with a slight ruffle on the shoulder straps. Kasumi had a smile on her face as she chopped the vegetables that would go into the noodle dish she was making. Next to the stove was a pot of rice cooking in a plain rice cooker. With a smile Akane grabbed the two kettles and put them onto the stove.<p>"Good morning Akane." Kasumi said keeping the smile on her face, "Making tea?"<p>"No, just preparing some hot water for Ranma and that baka father of his." Akane replied.<p>"Oh that's nice." Kasumi commented not realizing what Akane had planned for Genma.<p>After getting the water started Akane went over to where her sister was chopping the vegetables and grabbed a knife and some uncut vegetables and started to help Kasumi prepare breakfast.<p>"Thank you Akane. I didn't know you could cook." Kasumi said.<p>"When you're around a baka like Genma Saotome you learn how to cook real fast." Akane replied as she began cutting the green onion.<p>********<p>Out in the yard Ranma and Genma were well into their morning spar. Ranma's smaller female frame allowed him more speed over Genma's heavy panda body. Genma could tell Ranma was a lot faster than before the incident in China. It was obvious to the Saotome patriarch that Ranma had spent time learning how to fight in his female form. In fact, he seemed very comfortable in his cursed form unlike Genma who still had yet to get used to the changes the cold water triggered.<p>"Ha! You're getting slow pop." Ranma taunted as he landed a kick to Genma's midsection.<p>"Growf." Genma snorted in irritation just before charging Ranma head on.<p>Ranma saw the fat heavy set panda heading straight for him and decided to end the match once and for all so he could clean up before breakfast. Rushing Genma head on Ranma powered up for the special technique he learned from Ku Lon. Ranma had wanted to use this technique on Genma ever since they left the Amazon village.<p>"Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken!" Ranma called out as his hands became blurs connecting with Genma's midsection and upper body.<p>Ranma continued the volley of fast punches as he pushed Genma further and further back towards the koi pond. And in a few short moments Genma Saotome once again found himself in the koi pond.<p>"I win pop." Ranma said triumphantly, "I'm going inside old man."<p>With that Ranma made his way into the house and then into the kitchen where he saw Akane and Kasumi making breakfast. Akane looked up from where she was slicing the shitakes for the miso and smiled at Ranma before walking over to the stove and pulling off one of the kettles. She then handed the kettle to Ranma and walked back over to the stove and turned up the flame on the other kettle. Ranma could tell Akane was still mad at his father for the incident in their room.<p>"Well I'm going to go get cleaned up before breakfast." Ranma said as he poured the hot water on his head returning him to normal.<p>"Knock before you go into the furoba Ranma. I saw Nabiki headed that way before I came down." Akane told him in hopes of avoiding the prior night's incident again.<p>A few moments later a wet furry Genma walked into the kitchen and glared at Akane. Kasumi tried not to breath in the smell of sweaty wet panda fur. Akane then walked over to the remaining kettle on the stove and took it over to Genma where she dumped it on his head.<p>"Grrrooooowwwwllll-yeeeeoooouuuch! That was too hot girl!" Genma yelled.<p>"Oops." Akane replied trying to look innocent.<p>********<p>Fifteen minutes later the residents of the Tendo Dojo were gathered around the dining table. The simple breakfast consisting of grilled fish, rice, miso soup, and pickles was doubled to accommodate the increased number of people in the house. Before they began the meal Kasumi brought out the tea and sat down in the position closest to the kitchen door. And with a hearty itadakimasu the meal was soon underway and so was the insanity.<p>Ranma and his father turned what was to be a quiet simple breakfast into a battle over who would get the most fish, pickles, and rice. With blurred hands Ranma would always be one step ahead of Genma grabbing the piece of food he wanted with a satisfied smirk. Akane did nothing to stop their behavior because in her mind Genma deserved everything coming to him.<p>"Akane as your father I've decided you're going to go to school." Soun announced out of the blue.<p>"Boy you're going with her." Genma added with a glare.<p>"School?" the pair said in disbelief.<p>"It's the same one I go to." Nabiki told them.<p>That was when Akane realized the blouse and blue jumper Nabiki was wearing was actually a school uniform. There was no way Akane was going to wear something like that.<p>"Might as well get an education boy we're going to be here for a while." Genma said as he plucked the last bit of fish off the tray.<p>********<p>The Journey<p>Episode Three: The Blue Thunder of Furinkan<p>********<p>When breakfast had ended Nabiki thanked her sister for the great meal and got up to grab her school bag before heading out the front door. And as she was about to leave Nabiki called out to Ranma and Akane to join her.<p>"Come on you two before you're late." Nabiki said.<p>Reluctantly Ranma and Akane followed Nabiki out the door and on their way to the local high school Furinkan High. And while Nabiki took the ground route Ranma and Akane walked along the top of a fence that ran along the side of the street.<p>"What's that for?" Nabiki asked her sister.<p>"Balance training." Akane replied.<p>"Okay whatever you say." Nabiki commented.<p>Nabiki then decided to lay out a few ground rules about life at Furinkan High. Mainly rules that pertained to her status at the school.<p>"Before we get to school there are a few things I need to tell you two." Nabiki said, "First off you may or may not hear things about betting and a few side businesses I run. That information stays on school property. Second, everything I do comes with a price. You want any of my time then you'll have to pay me money. It's as simple as that. Third, I have a name and a reputation at that school to protect. You will not say or do anything that will damage that reputation. Fourth, unless I come over to you first during lunch and before school you will not talk to me. And finally, what happens the moment I arrive at school must not be interfered with. I have my own way of handling the students at this school and you will not mess that up. Have I made myself clear?"<p>"Yes." Akane replied not believing her sister could be this way.<p>"You want to be left alone at school and for us to keep our mouths shut. Got it." Ranma added.<p>"Oh and Ranma I still haven't forgiven you for what happened last night pervert." Nabiki said.<p>It was at that point a big white blob came running up to the group and knocked both Ranma and Akane into the drainage gully on the other side of the fence. The pair of martial artists climbed out of the gully in their cursed forms.<p>"What was that for pop?" Ranma demanded to know.<p>"You should always be on your guard and you my boy have gotten soft." Genma said.<p>"You've completely stepped over your bounds old man!" Akane yelled as she knocked Genma into the drainage gully.<p>With a sigh Ranma grabbed Akane's hand and turned around to head back to the Tendo Dojo in order to get some hot water.<p>"Come on we need to get some hot water Akane." Ranma said.<p>"Hold it you two. You'll most definitely be late if you head back home. If you'll follow me I'll show you a place where you can get some warm water free of charge of course." Nabiki told them.<p>Nabiki led Ranma and Akane down a nearby street and stopped when they reached a small building. Nabiki motioned for the young couple to stay near the gate while she walked up to the house to get the water. And while Ranma and Akane watched Nabiki at the door to the building something snuck up on them. Ranma could feel a bony hand on his shoulder. Turning around he found himself face to face with a bona fide skeleton. Upon seeing the skeleton Ranma jumped.<p>"Sorry about that." A voice said.<p>Looking in the direction of the voice Ranma and Akane saw a man a few years older than Kasumi standing next to the skeleton. He was dressed in a black kimono and had dark brown eyes and black hair with small wire rimmed glasses. The gentleman had a smile on his face as he introduced himself.<p>"I'm Dr. Tofu Ono and this is Betty my skeleton." He said to the pair.<p>It was at that point Nabiki came over to the group and dumped two glasses of hot water over the heads of Ranma and Akane returning them to their normal forms.<p>"Thanks Nabiki." Akane said.<p>Dr. Tofu was amazed at what he had witnessed. He had read about Jusenkyo curses in one of his many medical books and had wanted to study the effects of such a curse on someone. And here right before him were two perfect specimens of Jusenkyo curses.<p>"Dr. Tofu I don't know if you remember my baby sister Akane. And this is the special guy in her life Ranma Saotome. They just returned from their training trip." Nabiki said introducing them.<p>"It's a pleasure to meet you Ranma and a real pleasure to see you again after all these years Akane. I've never seen anyone with a Jusenkyo curse before though I have read quite a bit about them." Tofu said to the young couple with a smile.<p>"It's nice to see you again too Tofu-sensei." Akane replied being polite.<p>"Come on you two before we're late to class." Nabiki said.<p>With that the trio headed off towards Furinkan High. The closer they got to the school the further apart from the young couple Nabiki became. As they got near the school Nabiki went from being a somewhat pleasant person to the Ice Queen of Furinkan. On school grounds Nabiki had a hard personality that commanded the respect of the other students.<p>"Remember you two rules three and five. You will not break them especially rule five." Nabiki reminded the young couple with a hard face.<p>With that Nabiki walked through the gates of Furinkan High. The moment Nabiki touched school grounds a group of boys announced her arrival.<p>"Nabiki Tendo is here." One student said.<p>"This should be good." Another student added.<p>"I wonder what she'll say to him this time." A third student said.<p>Nabiki cold as ice and never taking her eyes off the school building walked past the members of the Young Businessman's Club, the Furinkan Future Investors Club, and half the kendo team. By the time she was halfway to the building a perfect red rose landed at her feet announcing the arrival of Nabiki's adversary the captain of the kendo team.<p>"Nabiki Tendo don't think you can walk away from me." The young man in a dark kimono and matching hakama said.<p>"Listen Kuno I don't have time for this I'm running behind schedule." Nabiki replied with cold venom in her voice.<p>"I will have you Nabiki Tendo. You're business tactics and beautiful looks shall go well with my vast fortune and prestige. Say you'll be mine and you can have anything your heart desires." Kuno said.<p>"Not on your life will I ever be your girlfriend Kuno." Nabiki shot back.<p>With that Nabiki tried to walk away from the kendoist but failed miserably as Kuno grabbed her arm and pulled her closer to him so she was now looking him in the eyes.<p>"You and I have the most power in this school and if you say yes we could run this school." Kuno whispered in her ear, "Say no and I know of a few people who would love to hear about your extracurricular activities at this school."<p>Nabiki's front as the Ice Queen was in jeopardy of dropping due to fear, the fear that Kuno might go to the principal about Nabiki's little businesses. The only source of money the Tendo family had right now was in serious trouble of being taken away from her. Akane saw what was happening and turned to her husband with a desperate look on her face.<p>"Ranma we have to do something." Akane said, "I don't care about her stupid rules right now."<p>"That guy has gone too far. This is a matter of family honor." Ranma added.<p>Ranma was all too familiar with defending family honor. It was part of the reason he and Akane had gotten married when they did. If they hadn't his interference during an unwanted fight Akane had suddenly founded herself in would have resulted in severe punishment from the elders. In the Amazon society a male couldn't break up a challenge fight for honor unless he was married to one of the combatants. In their society family honor was very big deal. Challenge one person for honor and you challenge the entire family.<p>Moving together as one Ranma and Akane rushed the kendoist to only break their unison when they reached him. Ranma successfully freed Nabiki from his grip while Akane landed a blow to his head knocking him to the ground. Kuno looked up from his spot on the ground and saw what he thought was the most beautiful woman in the world and an unknown ruffian who had interrupted his private business.<p>"Such a vision of loveliness can only be within my company. You have defeated me in honorable combat and now I will allow you to go out with me." He said to Akane.<p>"Touch her and I swear you'll receive more than a blow to the head." Ranma hissed at him.<p>"Who are you to be so familiar with Nabiki Tendo and my beautiful vision of loveliness?" Kuno demanded to know.<p>"The name's…" Ranma tried to tell him.<p>"Ah but it is customary for one to give one's own name first. Then mine I shall give! I am the rising star of the high school kendo world Junior Group E Upperclassman Tatewaki Kuno. But you may call me the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High." Kuno declared.<p>"If that's the way you want it. I am Ranma Saotome the heir to the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts. And you Kuno are threatening the honor of the Tendo family." Ranma replied.<p>Kuno gave out a little snort before giving his response to Ranma's remark.<p>"Who are you to know anything about the Tendo family?" Kuno demanded to know.<p>"Nabiki Tendo is my family. Her sister Akane over there is my wife." Ranma told him, "I find out you've tried to go after either one of them and I'll have your perverted head."<p>With that Ranma gave Kuno a swift blow to the head knocking him down to the ground once again. The pigtailed martial artist then walked off to the school building with Akane and Nabiki.<p>"Let that be your first warning Kuno." Ranma yelled over his shoulder.<p>********<p>Everyone in Nabiki's class was talking about what happened between her and Kuno. All the girls wanted to know who the real cute guy was that punched out Kuno. The boys in the class thought the guy was crazy to go up against Kuno. And some of Nabiki's closest friends wanted to know where her little sister had been for the past ten years. The low murmurs in the classroom soon died down when Kuno walked into the classroom and stopped right in front of Nabiki. Everyone in the class turned their attention to the pair to see what would happen next.<p>"Nabiki Tendo I am giving up my claim on you. You are now a free woman." Kuno announced, "And now with that out of the way I wish to use your services. I wish to know everything this is to know about the fiery spirit that is you sister Akane. She is now the one worthy of my attention."<p>With that he placed five hundred yen on Nabiki's desk.<p>"Kuno you seem to forget she's married to Ranma. And even though she hasn't taken his name they have been married for over a year now. Although it was some village ceremony during their time in China so I don't know how legal it is yet." Nabiki replied.<p>Kuno hearing only what he wanted to hear believed Ranma and Akane were engaged in premarital relations and that Ranma was forcing her to commit those acts.<p>"I shall never let that fiend Saotome to take advantage of my fiery spirit.  I swear on this day that Akane Tendo will be mine." Kuno declared.<p>Nabiki gave Kuno a slight glare as he made his statement. I'd love to see you try, she thought.<p>********<p>Akane and Ranma stood before the class nervous at being in front of a new group of people. The teacher had wanted the pair to stand up before the class and introduce themselves to their new classmates. Ranma's mind was still focused on what Kuno had done before class. The pigtailed martial artist knew he was going to have to deal with the bokken wielding psychopath before things really got out of hand. Akane on the other hand just stood before the class with a forced smile on her face. She was quite worried about her sister and what Kuno had been doing to her.<p>"Class I'd like to introduce to you two new students to our classroom. This Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo. The pair has just returned from a trip to China. So let's give a big Nihao welcome to Ranma and Akane. Why don't you tell the class about yourselves." The teacher said.<p>Ranma decided to go first and wasn't really up to it.<p>"The name's Ranma Saotome heir to the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts. There's not much to say about me other than the fact that I study martial arts." Ranma said sounding a bit bored.<p>When Ranma had finished Akane let out a sigh and took her turn.<p>"My name is Akane Tendo and I too study martial arts. If you're wondering yes Nabiki Tendo is my sister. And that's pretty much it." Akane said with the same tone of voice as Ranma.<p>"Thank you Akane, Ranma. There are a couple of empty desks in the back of the room. You two can sit there." The teacher said.<p>With that the pair sat down in the seats the teacher had pointed out. It wasn't long afterward that the teacher addressed the pair once more.<p>"Now then you two I do realize it is your first day but that doesn't excuse you from being late to class which you were. So I want the two of you to stand out in the hall with the buckets." The teacher said.<p>"Yes sensei." They replied at the same time.<p>The pair got out of their desks and made their way into the hall to hold buckets. It wasn't the best thing the world but they would gladly accept the punishment because of the reason they were late to class. And with a sigh of boredom Ranma and Akane began their time out in the hall.<p>********<p>Things were going well in Nabiki's class. That is until Nabiki passed a note over to Kuno. Kuno opened the carefully folded note and read what it said. Your five hundred yen has entitled you to this piece of information.  Not only does Akane sleep with Ranma every night she also bathes with Ranma. Who knows what goes on in the furo when those two are there? You want more it'll cost you. Pleasure doing business with you Kuno-baby. Nabiki.<p>Kuno read the note over and over again several times his face getting redder and redder with anger each time he read it. Nabiki's little part about Ranma and Akane in the bath together combined with Kuno believing Ranma had befouled Akane's honor through premarital relations and an illegal marriage had him imagining Ranma forcing himself on Akane while they were in the furo with Akane begging for mercy. After reading the note for the seventh time Kuno couldn't take it any longer and shot out of his chair and yelled at the top of his lungs interrupting the teacher.<p>"I cannot idly stand by and let that letch Saotome ruin the good name of my fiery spirit Akane Tendo!" Kuno yelled out.<p>The teacher was so mad at what Kuno had done that he was literally boiling under the collar. As soon as Kuno finished yelling the teacher did some yelling of his own.<p>"Kuno out in the hall right now! And don't forget the buckets!" he yelled as he pointed to the classroom door.<p>With that the Blue Thunder marched out of the room picking up the two filled buckets along the way. And as he did so he mumbled things he'd like to do to one Ranma Saotome.<p>********<p>"You know we're going to have to talk to Nabiki about this Kuno character." Ranma said to Akane starting up a conversation.<p>"Yeah that guy is a major creep." Akane replied.<p>It was then that said major creep Kuno made himself known by yelling down the hallway as he came walking up to the pair.<p>"Oh look it's the creep now." Akane said dryly.<p>"Ranma Saotome I will not allow this to go on any further!" Kuno yelled at him.<p>"And what might that be?" Ranma asked Kuno with an angry glare.<p>"You're treatment of Akane Tendo you letch." Kuno shot back.<p>"I was under the impression that it was okay to do those things with my wife you perverted pig."<p>"You were sadly mistaken if you thought she was your wife."<p>"And I told you to keep away from her!"<p>"Listen Saotome I will expose you for the letch that you are and then Akane Tendo will be mine!"<p>Upon hearing Kuno spout adulterous talk Ranma dropped his buckets and whacked the kendoist upside the head.<p>"That's two!" Ranma yelled as he clenched his fists together.<p>"So it's a fight you want Saotome." Kuno shot back.<p>"You and me right now! Or are you chicken?" Ranma challenged as he climbed to the window.<p>"You're on Saotome." Kuno replied accepting the challenge following him to the window.<p>With that Ranma leapt out of the window forgetting that he was on the third floor of the school. A moment later Kuno followed Ranma out the window. It was at that point that Akane and a good portion of the classes on the third floor stuck their heads out the windows. Looking down they saw that Ranma and Kuno were going to fall into the school pool. Fortunately Ranma would fall in first but unfortunately the water from the pool would activate his curse. Although Ranma was used to the curse by now no one at school knew about it yet. He didn't want to have to face that possibility.<p>"Ranma the pool!" Akane yelled to get his attention and inform him of his destination.<p>"Oh no." Ranma groaned when he realized where he was going to end up and who would be joining him moments later.<p>Seconds later Ranma Saotome cut through the surface of the pool and changed into a girl for the second time that day. Ranma knew he had to get out of the pool as fast as he could before Kuno saw him. But it was too late for the martial artist when he felt Kuno's arms around his feminine waist.<p>********<p>I'm good and bad at the same time. Good because this is my third episode in three days and bad because I left you with a cliffhanger. A very big thank you goes out to everyone who reviewed the story especially Vixen. That was the first time a review actually made me laugh so much I cried. But Vixen's review had me thinking about how to handle the Kuno issue. As you can see I've made him a real jerk. Oh and I'll need your input on how I should handle the Ryouga situation. You know the initial curse.<p>Okay now about the way Kuno acted in this episode. With no Akane around Kuno had to put somebody up on that pedestal and that person just happened to be Nabiki. Now we know Nabiki has sort of an I think you're a pervert attitude towards Ranma but she can learn to live with him eventually. The rules Nabiki had set up stem from her problems with Kuno. As I said in the episode and we all know from countless other fan works, the manga, and the anime Nabiki's hush-hush business dealings at school along with her photography are the only moneymakers for the dojo. Kuno threatened to take away her source of income thus scaring the socks off her. Take into account the way Kuno did what he did and you can see why Ranma acted they way he did. Family honor is very important to Ranma. And he doesn't like to see it threatened the way Kuno did.<p>Now I bet you're all wondering if Kuno will be obsessed with his pigtailed girl? In one word yes. As Vixen put it Kuno ignores their love and any legal claim for his delusions. And yes Vixen they are husband and wife both in and out of cursed form. They sleep in the same bed together so they'd better be. Oh and I have a reason for Genma being a twit. He yanks them away from the Amazon village for a reason he's not willing to mention just about the time the Musk (the neighboring warrior tribe) are about to make good on their threats to the Amazons. And with Shampoo a mother of course Akane and Ranma are going to worry for the safety of their friend's child. Also with Akane not smacking Ranma every chance she gets she needs someone to hit on the head and Genma fits that void nicely. Hence the intentionally boiling kettles of water in the morning. Besides, in my opinion an Akane who can work her way around a kitchen and do martial arts is a deadly combination especially if she learned to cook from Cologne.<p>So what's going to happen next? Well Ranma and Kuno are in the middle of their fight. And it looks like Kuno is going to have another obsession when the female Ranma beats him. Like I said he has no legal rights to his delusions. Say hello to your pigtailed goddess Kuno. The weather forecast for the next episode is increasing clouds and a ninety percent chance of rain. It's challenges, love, money, and red heads galore in The Journey episode three: Kuno's Goddesses.
