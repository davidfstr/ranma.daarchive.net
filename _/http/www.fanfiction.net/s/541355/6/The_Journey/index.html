</div>The sun shone down on the ward known as Nerima making it the perfect day to forget about work around the house for one day and just be outside. It seemed as though everyone in Nerima was doing just that on the bright sunny Saturday. The streets of Nerima were filled with people going here and there out enjoying what the day had to offer. And among the many pedestrians on the streets of Nerima were two overly cute girls. One had long blue-black hair pulled into a ponytail with a bow and brown eyes dressed in a cute blue blouse and a short brown skirt with suspenders and brown loafers. The other was a red haired girl with a pigtail and blue eyes dressed in an olive green "Chairman Mao" suit complete with the hat that had the red star on the front. Both girls had innocent looks on their faces.<p>The two girls were currently standing in front of a small cart using what they referred to as the overly cute technique of getting more food for less. They had perfected the technique during a journey home from China and kept it secret from their traveling companion. And a day like this one simply begged for the girls to use the technique once more.<p>"You're such a pair of sweet little girls. Here have another bun for free." The vendor said as he handed them a bag filled to the brim with sticky buns.<p>"Thank you very much." The red head replied looking extra cute.<p>With that the girls took the bag of buns and walked down the street each eating one of the sticky treats with identical smiles on their faces.<p>"If there's one thing I like about this body Akane it's the free food we get." The red head commented to her companion with a mouth full of her bun.<p>"I'm just glad this old outfit still fits me Ranma. It makes me look at least two years younger than I really am." Akane replied.<p>Ranma had intentionally turned himself into a girl that day as a part of his training. Back in the Amazon village Ku Lon had told him that he would have to get used to fighting in his female form and would make him spend entire days working on his martial arts as a female. In fact, it was through the use of one of her shiatsu points that she was able to teach Ranma the chestnut fist. Ku Lon had made it so Ranma wouldn't be able to stand hot water and locked him in his female form. It was only when he had mastered the chestnut fist and had actually been able to grab chestnuts from an open fire that Ku Lon would give him the antidote to the cat fist pressure point. Ranma had spent a week as a woman and began to accept his situation.<p>The pair continued walking down the streets of Nerima giggling and laughing and acting totally cute and innocent. As they made their way towards the dojo they heard the sounds of someone fighting. And to Ranma's ears the fight sounded one sided something he couldn't stand.<p>When Ranma and Akane got to the vacant lot where the fight was taking place they saw several people covered in bandages surrounding a girl in a black and white school uniform with a gym bag in her hands. The bandaged individuals had clubs in their hands and were holding them like weapons. The girl only held a simple gymnast's ribbon in her hands.<p>"Forgive me if I've failed to convey my message." The girl said.<p>With that the girl pulled out her ribbon and began using it like a whip. In an elegant display of grace and beauty she deflected the clubs tossed at her and then turned her ribbon on the individuals that used them against her. Ranma couldn't stand to see someone beat up on injured individuals.<p>With a silent nod to Akane the pair of aquatransexual martial artists jumped off the fence they were perched on and confronted the girl. Akane dropped into a ready stance the moment she hit the ground while Ranma just waited for the girl to make her next move. Within mere moments of dipping into the fight the girl sent her ribbon flying towards the bandaged band once more. Ranma caught the ribbon with the reflexes of a cat much to the surprise of the girl.<p>"Don't ya think that's enough?" Ranma wanted to know.<p>"You've already won right?" Akane added.<p>The girl glared at Ranma quite angry he had interfered with her fight.<p>"You caught that ribbon as if it were nothing." She commented, "If you'll forgive me you two seem to be no ordinary girls."<p>"Yeah you could say that." Ranma replied.<p>With that the girl kicked up two of the fallen clubs and discarded her ribbon all in one move.<p>"Good because I don't treat girls with ordinary courtesy!" she said as she thrust the first of the two clubs at Ranma and threw the second one at Akane.<p>Ranma dodged the first club dropping to the ground while Akane caught the second one. Ranma then used a low sweeper knocking the girl off her feet. At the same time Akane tossed the club back at the girl. The girl then righted herself by going into a front walkover kicking the club out of the way just before landing on her feet. Ranma and Akane stood there with glares on their faces waiting for the next move. The girl then tossed a single black rose right into Ranma's waiting hands.<p>"Well you two are very good." The girl commented, "Remember I'm the Black Rose of St. Herbeke School for Girls. Kodachi the Black Rose. Don't you forget it."<p>With that Kodachi the Black Rose left the lot bounding over the fence.<p>********<p>The Journey<p>Episode Six: Attack of the Black Rose<p>********<p>Ranma and Akane turned to get a good look at the bandaged group all around them. With their faces completely covered and dressed in blue sweat suits it was hard to tell if they were male or female. But what was evident was the fact that they were currently on their knees crying their eyes out.<p>"How humiliating." One of them sobbed out.<p>Ranma turned to one of the group and bent down to talk to them.<p>"What's with all the crying? You're men." Ranma wondered.<p>It was then that the sobbing group removed the bandages and revealing a group of females.<p>"That's what you think! We're the Furinkan High Rhythmic Gymnastics team." One of the girls yelled at Ranma.<p>"Smooth move Ranma." Akane whispered to him.<p>Embarrassed at what he had said to the girls and not wanting to be recognized Ranma lowered his hat over his eyes. Oh great he thought, they're from my class.<p>"Why don't we go to my house and you can tell us what's going on." Akane offered.<p>********<p>Ranma, Akane, and the members of the gymnastics team sat around their room discussing what had happened to them. The girls looked broken and battered and were crying in heaving sobs. It was hard for both Ranma and Akane to watch them without getting overly emotional themselves. And when the girls realized Akane was Nabiki Tendo's younger sister they remembered she was a very good martial artist who would understand about defending one's honor.<p>"We've been humiliated Akane." The captain said with a sob.<p>"Every member of the team has been injured?" Akane wanted to know.<p>"We were ambushed!" another girl said.<p>"Now we'll have to withdraw from the match!" a third girl sobbed.<p>Akane thought about what the girls had said and the condition they were in.  She could tell they didn't want to have to forfeit the match and would do anything to make it. With a soft sigh Akane addressed the gymnasts.<p>"So you want me to fill in for you is that it?" Akane wanted to know.<p>"Please Akane there's nothing else we can do!" the captain sobbed.<p>"It's a matter of honor." The second girl added.<p>The mention of honor was the bait that had Akane hooked. She knew how it felt to have her honor threatened. The challenges the girl in the Amazon village had made threatened to take away her honor and have her kicked out of the only stable home she had in almost ten years.<p>"This next match is Rhythmic Gymnastic Wrestling!" the captain yelled through her tears.<p>"What in the world is that?" Ranma wanted to know.<p>The captain pulled out diagram of the sport they practiced and had a couple of her teammates hold it up for Ranma and Akane to see.<p>"This!" she said pointing to the diagram, "The schools' champions fight with the techniques of rhythmic gymnastics!"<p>"I'm still not sure I understand all this but I will avenge your honor!" Akane declared.<p>"Oh thank you Akane!" the girls all said as they gathered around her.<p>********<p>That night after dinner Akane and Ranma were in the dojo preparing Akane for the upcoming match against Kodachi. Akane had borrowed some equipment from the team and had everything she would need in the dojo. Laid out on the floor was a pair of clubs, a hoop, a ribbon, and a heavy rubber ball. Ranma sat on the floor inspecting the borrowed equipment wondering if Akane would be able to use all of it properly. Akane dressed in a light blue Chinese style leotard stretched out before she got down to work.<p>"You know I don't think you should have accepted so fast. At least not until you knew if you could use any of this stuff." Ranma commented.<p>"Ranma this is matter of honor school honor. These girls take their sport seriously according to what Nabiki said at the dinner table." Akane reminded him.<p>Akane was about to practice using the ribbon when the door to the dojo opened accompanied by a loud snort. Turning to the door Ranma and Akane saw the little black pig known as Ryouga walk into the dojo with a curious look in his face. Ranma got a dark look on his face and Akane just smiled.<p>"Well, just where have you been? She's been worried about you P-chan." Akane said as she gave Ryouga a little scratch under the chin.<p>"P-chan? She?" Ranma wondered.<p>"P-chan. P for pig and chan for little." Akane explained, "Between school, training, and you I really don't have time to take care of a pet. Besides I thought Kasumi could use some company during the day so I gave him to her. She came up with the name."<p>"Looks like you got the best of the situation Ryouga." Ranma whispered to the pig.<p>Akane picked up the clubs and began to twirl them around before tossing them in the air as she performed a flying kick high in the air. As Akane came down the clubs landed a good eight feet in front of her. Ranma sat there blinking a few times before making any comments.<p>"I don't think that was supposed to happen." Ranma said.<p>"Let's try the ribbon next." Akane replied picking up the ribbon.<p>Akane tried to twirl the ribbon but ended up getting it tangled around her neck.<p>"Now I know that's not supposed to happen." Ranma commented.<p>"Maybe I'm better at the hoop." Akane said.<p>With that Akane tossed the hoop into the air and caught it while she leapt into the air. Akane then brought the hoop down and brought it up her legs as she landed on the floor. Instead of going up her legs the hoop got caught between her legs and broke.<p>"I guess they don't make hoops like they used to." Ranma commented trying to make her feel better about what happened.<p>"It's no use I'll never get this right." Akane said frustrated.<p>"You'll get it sooner or later." Ranma reassured her.<p>Upon seeing Akane struggle with the rhythmic gymnastics equipment Ryouga decided he needed to do something to help her and ran to the house. The lost boy made his way to the furoba and dashed to the furo where Soun Tendo was taking a long soak. Ryouga jumped into the furo and emerged from the water naked as the day he was born. Soun just stared at the young man realizing what his daughter's new pet really was. This is getting too weird, he though as Ryouga left the furoba.<p>********<p>Akane sat on the floor of the dojo crying her eyes out in Ranma's arms. She had tried to use the gymnastics equipment properly but ended up getting tangled, breaking the hoop, and over tossing the clubs. Akane felt as though she were letting down not only the rhythmic gymnastics team but the entire school as well. Ranma tried everything he could to make her feel better.<p>"I'm a klutz and a failure Ranma." Akane sobbed.<p>"No you're not. You've just never done this before. I'd like to try and help you but I know just as much about this as you do. I'm sorry but I don't know what I can do." Ranma said.<p>Just then the young couple heard a voice in doorway to the dojo.<p>"I can help you Akane." Ryouga said.<p>"Ryouga." Akane replied with a few last tears in her eyes.<p>"Hey what happened to P-chan?" Ranma teased the lost boy.<p>Ryouga grabbed Ranma by the collar of his shirt and glared at him right in the eyes. Ryouga's cursed form may not have been considered Akane's pet but he didn't want any more people finding out about his curse. So far only Ranma, Genma, and Soun Tendo knew about Ryouga's curse. Ryouga had yet to learn about Akane's curse and when he did maybe he would tell her about his curse. Until then he would keep it a secret from as many people as possible.<p>"Who is P-chan?" Ryouga asked acting as though he had no clue.<p>"Yeah who IS P-chan?" Ranma repeated emphasizing the word is.<p>"Can you really help me Ryouga?" Akane wanted to know.<p>Ryouga looked over to Akane and gave her a small smile before picking up the ribbon.<p>"The ribbon." Ryouga said.<p>The lost boy began twirling the ribbon in perfect spirals connecting with various parts of Ranma's body. The pigtailed martial artist jumped back trying to avoid any more hits. Soon Ranma found himself up against the dojo wall.<p>"Wow Ryouga that was real good." Akane commented.<p>"Jeez did ya have be do rough!" Ranma complained.<p>Ryouga just stood there with a smirk on his face.<p>********<p>In the dark of night a cloaked figure made its way down the streets of Nerima. People stopped and stared ad the figure slinked towards its final destination. The figure was headed towards the Tendo Dojo. And when it arrived at its final destination the figure removed the cloak to reveal the lithe muscular figure of Kodachi the Black Rose of St. Herbeke.<p>Kodachi was dressed in an all black leotard with her trademark black rose in her mouth. In her hands Kodachi had a very large wooden mallet. The demented gymnast had a look of malice and determination on her face. Kodachi studied her final destination, the Tendo Dojo. So they've asked for help, she thought, the Furinkan High gymnasts are a bunch of bad losers.<p>"Akane Tendo Kodachi the Black Rose will cripple you." She declared.<p>********<p>Akane and Ryouga had been at it for hours practicing with each of the disciplines in rhythmic gymnastics. Ranma had watched as they worked with the various equipment making progress as they went. The aquatransexual martial artist was quite surprised at how good Ryouga was with rhythmic gymnastics. He was also proud of the progress Akane had made in one night.  She still had a long way to go before the match but she wasn't getting tangled or dropping everything in sight.<p>"That's enough training for today. You're handling the ribbon very well. I'm quite amazed at the quick progress you're making." Ryouga told her.<p>"You really think so?" Akane wanted to know.<p>"I have to agree with him Akane you really are getting better. You need a lot more work but you are getting better." Ranma said.<p>Akane gave Ryouga a smile before turning her attention to Ranma. The youngest member of the Tendo family smiled at her husband and gave him a kiss on the cheek before heading off to the house.<p>"Well, I'm going to use the furo. I'll see you in bed." Akane said as she left.<p>********<p>Akane sat in the furo with a sullen look on her face. While it was true that she was improving she felt as though she wouldn't be ready for the upcoming match against Kodachi. The match was a week away and Akane needed a lot of work. Ranma wasn't any better than she was and even though Ryouga had offered to help her she began to wonder if maybe it was a lost cause.<p>"Even if it is true it's only a week until the match. Maybe I shouldn't have agreed to help. But their honor is at stake and I can't let them down." Akane mused as she soaked in the warm water.<p>With a sigh Akane hugged her legs to her chest and tried to convince herself she was doing the right thing by helping the gymnastics team.<p>********<p>Ranma and Ryouga sat outside by the koi pond talking. Although Ranma didn't fully trust Ryouga he was grateful Ryouga had offered to help Akane get ready for the match. Ranma had seen the look on Akane's face when the girls on the team had mentioned their honor being at stake. The incident in Jokesuzoku had Akane vowing no one should have to go through what she did. The constant humiliation and ridicule were so bad Akane didn't want to face something like that ever again and Ranma vowed to make certain she would never have to.<p>"Look I appreciate what you're doing but that doesn't automatically make up for what you did at school. I'm still going to keep my eye on you." Ranma said.<p>"I'm doing this as a favor to Akane. I still say you made my life hell Ranma but she had nothing to do with it. Plus her sister has allowed me a place to stay and first cracks at any leftovers. Granted I have to be the little pig but for someone like Kasumi Tendo I don't mind." Ryouga replied.<p>"Hey I could care less what you do as long as you don't break their hearts." Ranma commented.<p>"You know I have to commend Akane for her dedication and willingness to defend the gymnastics team. Unlike some people I know who have no sense of honor whatsoever." Ryouga said.<p>Ranma didn't like it when someone made fun of honor. After seeing what Akane had gone through in China Ranma took honor seriously. He didn't want to see anyone to have to go through what he and Akane went through at Jusenkyo as a form of punishment. And when he tried to defend Akane his own honor was called into question by the Amazon tormenting her.<p>"Look pig boy don't you ever say I have no sense of what honor is. You have no idea what Akane and I went through in China. I would give my life defending her honor and my own if need be." Ranma said trying to keep his anger in check.<p>"Don't call me that Saotome!" Ryouga yelled.<p>With that Ryouga rushed Ranma hoping to land a blow or two to the aquatransexual martial artist. Soon the pair was locked in combat once again.<p>********<p>Akane, dressed in a t-shirt and blue pajama bottoms, trudged into her room sore and tired from her workout with Ryouga and flopped down on the bed. She knew by the time Ranma came up to bed she would be fast asleep. Rolling over on the bed Akane stared up at the ceiling and saw something or rather someone clinging to it. There above the bed with a large wooden mallet strapped to her back was Kodachi the Black Rose. Great I didn't need this right now, Akane thought.<p>Kodachi grabbed her mallet and dropped down from the ceiling ready to strike. Akane avoided being hit and performed a backward flip with a twist and landed in a ready position.<p>"You!" Akane cried out.<p>"It looks like we are going to be opponents next week. So let us both do our best and fight in fairness." Kodachi said as she tried to take a swing at Akane.<p>"You call this fighting in fairness!" Akane yelled while she got in a hit of her own.<p>Kodachi quickly recovered and held her mallet in both hands staring down Akane. The gymnast was ready to strike Akane at any moment.<p>"You've been ambushing the team and now you're trying to ambush me!" Akane yelled.<p>"Ambush, I simply believe in fighting in all fairness before the match." Kodachi replied.<p>"That's the most ridiculous and dishonorable thing I've ever heard." Akane commented.<p>With a loud cry Kodachi began swinging the mallet pushing Akane closer and closer towards the open window. Akane reached the window and found herself with nowhere to go except out. Kodachi saw she had Akane backed up against the wall and rushed Akane. With one final swing of the mallet Akane went sailing out the window towards the pond down below. Kodachi not about to let Akane get away jumped into the window and leapt to the ground below.<p>********<p>Ranma and Ryouga were still locked in combat when they heard the scream come from the window above them. Distracted by the noise Ryouga let his guard down long enough for Ranma to get in a blow that sent the lost boy flying towards the koi pond. Ryouga hit the water a full two seconds after another splash could be heard in the water. The first person to emerge from the water in the koi pond was a very angry and very male looking Akane. Two seconds later Ryouga's yellow shirt floated to the surface of the pond followed by a miffed looking P-chan.<p>The fall into the koi pond had ended one fight and was the beginning of a whole new set of problems for the cursed trio. When Akane saw Ryouga's clothes in the water and P-chan trying to retrieve them it didn't take long for her to put two and two together and realize P-chan was Ryouga. But that was the least of her problems when she heard Kodachi touch ground.<p>"You can't run from the Black Rose for very long Akane Tendo!" Kodachi yelled.<p>Ranma took one look in the direction of the yelling and saw Kodachi standing on one of the rocks that lined the koi pond. Grabbing at straws Ranma tried to remember just who she was. That's that Black Petunia or Violet or whatever her name is, Ranma mused silently. Watching the scene by the pond Ranma saw Akane climb out of the water and glare at Kodachi.<p>"Time to finish this!" Akane declared.<p>But before Akane could do anything Kodachi took one look at Ranma and Akane and fell madly in love with them.<p>"I am terribly sorry if I have done anything to harm you my Lord." Kodachi said as she pulled Akane out of the pond.<p>Kodachi wrapped her arms around Akane and tried seducing her. Akane desperately tried to back away but ended up almost backing into Ranma.<p>"Ranma do something." Akane pleaded over her shoulder.<p>Akane's plea would go unanswered for the moment she was shoulder to shoulder with him Kodachi latched onto Ranma as well.<p>"Lord Ranma what a manly name. Surely you and your companion would be gentle with me on this night." Kodachi said in a way that all but screamed sleep with me.<p>"Look lady you have everything wrong my companion and I are a pair of happily married guys. Besides Akane will kill me if I do anything with another woman." Ranma sputtered nervously.<p>Kodachi then got a look of mischief on her face as though Ranma had given her permission to do something underhanded.<p>"Then I will just have to remove Akane Tendo from the picture permanently and you and I can be together forever my lord." Kodachi declared, "Until then my lords."<p>With that the Black Rose of St. Herbeke bounded out of the garden and over the front wall. Ranma looked over at Akane and just shuttered at the thought of seeing her again.<p>When Kodachi was well out of sight Akane went over to Ryouga and picked him up by the bandana and looked him straight in his little pig eyes.<p>"I know it's you Ryouga. You ended up at Jusenkyo didn't you?" Akane wanted to know.<p>The P-chan version of the lost boy looked at Akane and gave her a small nod in affirmation letting her know she was right before cringing in fear.<p>"Look P-chan is Kasumi's and not mine and besides no one else knows about this so you have no reason to worry. Now get your little piggy behind into that house before Kasumi comes looking for you." Akane told the lost boy.<p>After Akane put Ryouga back down on the ground the lost boy headed into the house to find Kasumi. Ranma looked at Akane as though she were crazy for letting Ryouga back into the house.<p>"What'd ya go and do that for?" Ranma wanted to know.<p>"He helped me out. Besides Kasumi likes the little pig and she'd be devastated if anything happened to him." Akane explained.<p>********<p>The next morning Ranma and Akane made their way through the gates of Furinkan to the well wishes of a good portion of the student population. Word of Akane agreeing to help the rhythmic gymnastics team had spread through the student population like wildfire and soon everyone felt they had a chance against St. Herbeke in the upcoming match.<p>"Akane, I hear you'll be representing us in rhythmic gymnastics." One female student said, "Don't let us down."<p>"I'll try my hardest." Akane replied with a smile.<p>Akane was about to follow Ranma into the mail building when her danger sense began to go haywire. All of a sudden the schoolyard permeated with the sound of a battle cry.<p>"Akane Tendo prepare yourself!" the female voice cried out.<p>Looking up Akane saw Kodachi rushing towards her with a bamboo kendo sword firmly in her grip ready to strike. Akane stopped the sword mere inches from her face.<p>"You again! Ambushing me first thing in the morning!" Akane yelled at her.<p>"Ambushing? I was merely here to visit with Ranma." Kodachi told her.<p>Akane suddenly became very angry and frustrated with Kodachi.<p>"Well you can't have him!" Akane yelled as she tossed Kodachi halfway across the schoolyard.<p>Kodachi landed deftly on her feet not too far from the retreating form of Ranma. The Black Rose began to run after the pigtailed martial artist calling out to him.<p>"Lord Ranma wait!" Kodachi called out.<p>Ranma glanced over his shoulder and saw Kodachi running after him. To complicate matters worse Kuno was heading in his direction which also happened to be the direction where Akane was. In his hands was a large bouquet of long stem red roses. Oh great Kuno, Ranma silently moaned.<p>Kuno was off in his own little world thinking about Akane and her participation in the upcoming rhythmic gymnastics match. Akane I can see her clearly in all her gymnastic grace, he thought, these red roses shall speak my encouragement to her.<p>"Akane I love you!" Kuno declared loudly as he sliced the air with his boken.<p>Ranma happened to be in the way of the boken and jumped into the air to avoid the wooden sword. With the grace of a true martial artist Ranma landed on the sword while at the same time using his other foot to land a blow to Kuno's face.<p>"What do you think you're doing!" Ranma demanded.<p>"Ranma Saotome what do you have against me?" Kuno wanted to know.<p>"Wait just a…" Ranma said before being interrupted.<p>Ranma suddenly felt a pair of arms grasp his shoulders and the heavy weight of a head resting against his back.<p>"Oh Lord Ranma." Kodachi whispered suggestively.<p>Kuno looked over Ranma's shoulder and saw the girl who had latched herself to him. And after a few moments thought the kendoist spoke to Ranma once more.<p>"Yes!" he said letting Ranma go causing him to fall into Kodachi's arms.<p>"Yes what?" Ranma wanted to know.<p>"Yes you have my permission to go steady." Kuno told them.<p>Kodachi's face lit up like a Christmas tree and she held onto Ranma even tighter.<p>"I'm so happy." Kodachi said.<p>The aquatransexual martial artist tried to pull away from the gymnast complaining about what was happening. Kuno was out of his mind if he was giving other girls permission to make advances on a married man and he was even crazier if he thought Akane would fall for him.<p>"Wait a minute you can't tell me what to do!" Ranma yelled.<p>Overreacting to what Ranma had said Kodachi broke down in a waterfall of forced tears.<p>"So you hate me!" Kodachi yelled at Ranma.<p>"No it's just I um have a wife is all. Her really." Ranma said nervously as he showed Akane to the delusional gymnast.<p>"W-w-w-wife? You?" Kodachi asked nervously.<p>"More or less." Akane replied.<p>"So how interesting." Kodachi mused.<p>With that Kodachi whipped out her ribbon and began attacking Akane and Ranma. The pair of cursed martial artists leapt out of the way and waited for what would happen next.<p>"What do you say then shall we wager for Ranma in the upcoming match?" Kodachi asked Akane.<p>Akane couldn't believe what she was hearing Kodachi was delusional she might as well be related to Kuno. She acted just as bad as the kendoist.<p>"Are you crazy?" Akane demanded to know.<p>"I think it's a fine idea Akane." Kuno commented from behind her, "If you wish to leave Ranma all you need to do is lose."<p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha she needn't worry about that. She'll lose in any case." Kodachi told him.<p>With that Kodachi turned her attention to a very nervous Ranma.<p>"Ranma when this match is over you shall be mine." Kodachi declared.<p>It was at that point Kodachi took her leave of Furinkan High in a swirl of her ribbon and a shower of black rose petals.<p>"Farewell." She said as she left the schoolyard bounding over the fence.<p>Kuno watched as Kodachi left with a transfixed gaze on his face.<p>"Really that girl is a deviant but even so Saotome take care of my little sister." Kuno said to a very confused Ranma.<p>"Wait a second what did you just say?" Ranma wanted to know.<p>"I said take care of my little sister." Kuno repeated as he got inches from Ranma's head.<p>Kuno then got a distant look on his face as he thought about his younger sister.<p>"Even though I am her brother I have to admire her for being so wicked so nasty, so spiteful and so thoroughly twisted." Kuno commented.<p>Coming back to the here and now Kuno turned his attention to Akane and handed her the bouquet of long stem red roses he had brought with him.<p>"Please Akane try not to let her hurt you." Kuno said before leaving, "When Kodachi wants a man she'll stop at nothing to get what she wants. She may even try something evil in the match."<p>Ranma and Akane stood there watching Kuno leave absorbing the latest piece of information.<p>"Ku…Kuno's sister?" Ranma said nervously.<p>"Now that I think about it those two are exactly the same." Akane commented.<p>********<p>Another episode finished. Sorry this one took so long. As I write the last part of this episode I'm watching my sister's kids. Good thing I decided to bring along the good old laptop. Once again I must thank my loyal readers especially MwhaleK. It's great to know you enjoy reading this so much. I'd also like to thank my brain for coming up with good ideas. Even when I'm stumped with one project it's always working on something new.<p>So why did I end this episode the way I did? Well I wanted to give the actual match its own attention. It takes up so much space in the manga and would take a while to write anyway. As you can see Kodachi is the female version of Kuno. It only goes to show since she is his sister. And while bear brother Kuno is obsessing over Akane and his water born goddess Kodachi is obsessing over Ranma and the brown haired boy. And they will both hate Ranma and Akane's forms that are the same gender as they are. In other words Kodachi hates their female side and Kuno hates their male side.<p>Also many of you are wondering about Ryouga. One reader pointed out that Ranma's sense of honor wouldn't allow him to keep Ryouga's secret from Akane. So to rectify that I decided to have Akane give P-chan to Kasumi. That way Ryouga can try and get Ranma and still have someone dote over him.  Akane will be nice to him but that's only because he helped her out with the rhythmic gymnastics. I haven't decided if it will stay that way or not.<p>Now for a personal note. Two weeks and counting until the Olympics begin in Salt Lake City and before we can have the opening ceremonies we have to suffer through another boring Super Bowl. I myself can't wait for the opening ceremonies but I don't like the idea of NBC leaking out who will be at the opening ceremonies. It makes me wonder if the SLOC changed things a bit after September 11 took place. I just hope it doesn't ruin the true purpose of the opening ceremonies. There needs to be something American, something native, and something that represents the history of Utah and Salt Lake City. And now that I've said my piece we can move on.<p>So what's on tap for our favorite cursed martial artists? Akane will still try and protect the honor of the gymnastics team but something will prevent her from competing. So who's going to take her place did someone say Ranma? It's the match up you've all been waiting for Ranma Saotome vs. Kodachi Kuno. Stay tuned for The Journey episode seven: Ranma vs. the Black Rose.
