</div>Akane had watched as Ranma leapt out the window followed closely behind by Kuno. She realized that in his anger and hatred for the kendoist Ranma had forgotten their classroom was on the third floor of the building. Quickly looking out the window Akane saw that Ranma had a chance to make it out of this alive. Below the window in the schoolyard was the large school pool. Getting his attention Akane let Ranma know what was below him.<p>Akane knew her message had gotten through to Ranma when she saw him turn his body from a feet first position in to a perfect dive. Ranma's body had cut through the water with the precision of an experienced cliff diver. Moments later Ranma was followed by Kuno who had tucked his body into a perfect cannonball position causing a large splash when he broke the water's surface. After the splash had ended Akane looked down to the water below and couldn't see Ranma or Kuno. Akane feared what Kuno would do to him if he saw Ranma's cursed form.<p>Ranma, like Akane, wondered what Kuno would do if he caught sight of his cursed form when he first saw the pool. The pigtailed martial artist may have been comfortable with his curse but he wasn't ready for any more people to find out about it. The Amazons, their families, and Dr. Tofu knowing about it were more than enough for Ranma. He didn't want a pervert like Kuno knowing about it.<p>Ranma's fear that Kuno might find out about his curse hit him heard when he felt the kendoist wrap his arms around his feminine mid section. Running on pure instinct Ranma elbowed Kuno in the gut causing the kendoist to let go and double over in pain. Ranma then used the brief moment of freedom he had to get out of the pool. Breaking the surface of the water Ranma could hear the voices of the students watching from the windows above the pool.<p>"Is that Saotome?" one student wondered.<p>"His body shrunk." Another said.<p>"Must be him he and Kuno went into the pool and Kuno hasn't come up yet." A third one pointed out to the others.<p>Ranma got out of the pool and made his way over to a tree not too far away.  Climbing into the branches Ranma hoped Kuno would give up and return to the building. But that wasn't going to happen. Kuno climbed out of the pool and began searching the yard calling out for him.<p>"My water born goddess where have you gone?" Kuno wanted to know.<p>Okay this guy has completely insane, Ranma thought as he watched Kuno.<p>As Kuno continued to search the schoolyard for his water born goddess Ranma caught the sight of two familiar figures heading his way. The familiar forms of the Tendo sisters came running up to the tree. In one of Nabiki's hands Ranma saw a kettle as Akane led her to the tree with the other hand. It was obvious Nabiki didn't want to be there from the expression on her face.<p>"Nabiki he did stop Kuno from doing anything that could hurt you. You at least owe him this." He could hear Akane say to Nabiki.<p>"That pervert broke my rules Akane." He heard Nabiki reply.<p>Ranma continued to watch the Tendo sisters not paying attention to the kettle being thrown into the tree. The kettle hit Ranma on the head bringing him back to his senses. Ranma caught the kettle before it could spill a single drop of the hot water and lost his balance. Ranma began to topple out of the tree and stopped himself from falling out completely by grasping the branch with his legs ending up upside-down and face to face with Tatewaki Kuno.<p>"Ah my beautiful water born goddess. We finally meet face to face. I can see that your beauty equals that of my fiery spirit Akane Tendo." Kuno said, "I will allow you the honor of dating with me."<p>Disgusted by Kuno's actions Ranma swung the kettle in his hands and connected with Kuno's head knocking him to the ground once again.<p>"Sick pervert." Ranma commented.<p>Ranma looked down at the sprawled out form of the kendo team captain with a satisfied grin on his face. Score one for the women, Ranma thought triumphantly. But the brief moment of triumph was soon shot down as the clouds in the sky began to open up. The gentle rain was enough to activate Akane's curse. As the rain picked up pace Akane helped Ranma out of the tree while at the same time Kuno began to stir and wake up.<p>"Who are you to touch my water born goddess?" Kuno demanded when he saw the male Akane.<p>"That is for me to know and you to find out creep." Akane replied.<p>"Stand aside vile cur."<p>Kuno pushed Akane out of the way and walked over to Ranma standing inches from his face. The kendoist was so enamored by Ranma's ample feminine looks that he had to have her. Pulling out his wooden boken Kuno pointed the tip of the practice katana right at Ranma's chest.<p>"I challenge you to a dual and if you defeat me you will be given the honor of dating me." Kuno said going off into his own little dream world.<p>"You're on." Ranma replied wanting to silence the kendoist as he took a ready stance.<p>Kuno made the first move slashing at Ranma with his boken. Ranma evaded the attack by jumping high into the air. On the way down Ranma sent a swift kick to Kuno's head.<p>"Such grace and power, I must have her. But I also must have Akane Tendo as well. I will have them both." Kuno declared as he slowly toppled over to the ground.<p>As Kuno fell to the ground Ranma swiftly disarmed the kendoist.<p>"You think I'm good. Ranma Saotome is even better." Ranma shot back with a glare as he gave the boken a quick twirl.<p>With that Ranma tossed the boken onto the ground and turned to Akane and Nabiki.<p>"Come on you two let's go." Ranma said as he began walking towards the dojo.<p>"Fine by me." Akane replied as she joined him.<p>"Wait what about school?" Nabiki demanded to know.<p>"I will have you both my fiery spirit and water born goddess." Kuno said to Ranma and Akane's retreating forms.<p>********<p>The Journey<p>Episode Four: Kuno's Goddess<p>********<p>The next day before class as Nabiki was catching up on her reading Kuno came walking into the classroom and made his way over to the middle Tendo daughter. Kuno had seen Nabiki with both his fiery spirit and his water born goddess that he wondered how well she knew them. He needed a way to get a message to them. Kuno desperately needed to see them again.<p>"Nabiki Tendo, tell me you know my water born goddess." Kuno demanded to know.<p>"If you mean the girl with red hair and pigtail in the Chinese clothes then yes I know her." Nabiki replied not looking up from her magazine.<p>"And she is close to your sister the fiery spirit Akane Tendo?" Kuno wanted to know.<p>"Yeah you could say that." Nabiki said not really paying attention to him.<p>Upon hearing Nabiki say his fiery spirit and water born goddess were close and Nabiki knew how to contact them Kuno went over to his desk. With pen and paper he composed a note to them asking to see them one more time. Kuno had big plans for the next time he saw them. When he had finished composing the note Kuno carefully folded the note and then wrote who the note should be delivered to on the front. With that he then returned to Nabiki's desk.<p>"You will make certain they receive this Nabiki Tendo." Kuno said as he handed her the note.<p>"Five hundred yen delivery charge Kuno-baby." Nabiki replied without missing a beat or looking up from the magazine.<p>"Fine." Kuno hissed as he put five hundred yen on the desk.<p>This is too easy, Nabiki thought.<p>Later that day after school was over with and everyone had returned home to the dojo Nabiki found Ranma and Akane sitting on the back porch. The pair was attempting to do the homework they were assigned for the day with little success. Nabiki walked up to them and placed the note from Kuno under Ranma's nose getting his attention.<p>"What's this?" he asked as he took the note.<p>"I have no idea. All he told me was to deliver that to his water born goddess and his fiery spirit." Nabiki replied, "I don't think he believes you two are the same as your cursed sides."<p>Ranma opened the note and took a look at what it said.<p>"On Sunday in the tenth hour meet me in the second field of Furinkan High School." Ranma read.<p>"Sounds like a duel." Akane commented as she looked over Ranma's shoulder.<p>"Kuno just hates to loose." Nabiki told them.<p>********<p>Sunday rolled around and Ranma and Akane prepared for their duel with Kuno.  And at the appointed time they arrived at the second field at Furinkan. Both were dressed in their Chinese clothes. Akane had on a short yellow dress with white buttons and Ranma had on a matching blue outfit with short sleeves. They both had on a pair of bracers on their wrists and a hard look on their faces. After a few moments of waiting Kuno arrived unarmed.<p>"So you both came my fiery spirit and water born goddess!" Kuno said.<p>"You don't learn do you?" Akane asked with a chuckle.<p>"Well where's your sword?" Ranma wanted to know.<p>"I don't need it for what I'm about to do." Kuno replied very confident.<p>Ranma and Akane looked at Kuno as if he had gone off the deep end.<p>"Pretty confident are we?" Ranma asked the kendoist.<p>"Confident enough to give the two of you these!" Kuno announced as he tossed two bouquets of perfect red roses.<p>The pair of cursed martial artists caught the bouquets and stared at them wondering what was going on. They were brought out of their trance when they heard Kuno call over his shoulder as he left.<p>"I love you both." Kuno announced.<p>Ranma and Akane stood there not believing what was going on. Kuno was living in a demented dream world if he believed he could break up the happily married couple.<p>********<p>That night as Ranma lay in his bed holding Akane close to him he had a dream. It was a very strange dream caused by Kuno's confession of love for Ranma's female side. It started out innocently enough with Ranma soaking in a natural hot spring.<p>"Man this feels good." Ranma commented as he sunk lower into the water.<p>All of a sudden the water began to toss and churn as something slowly broke through the surface. In no time Ranma was face to face with a giant Kuno.<p>"Ranma." Kuno said in a detached voice.<p>"Kuno? What are you doing here?" Ranma wanted to know.<p>The oversized Kuno didn't seem to listen to Ranma as he kept on speaking.<p>"I love you Ranma." The kendoist declared.<p>"First off I'm married. And second I'll have you know I'm a b…" Ranma tried to argue.<p>Ranma stopped dead in his tracks when he felt the water temperature drop and the familiar tingle hit his body signaling his change.<p>"What in the world is going on here?" Ranma demanded to know.<p>"Ranma go out with me." Kuno demanded.<p>"Wait a minute you pervert I'm a married man. Well I'm not a man right now but I am married." Ranma tried to tell the oversized Kuno.<p>Kuno then went to reach into the water as Ranma tried to swim away. But it was no use for the forty-foot kendoist soon had the pigtailed martial artist in his grasp.<p>"Ranma I love you." Kuno declared once more.<p>It was at that point Ranma let out a scream and bolted straight up in the bed brining Akane with him. The sudden jerk woke up his wife who turned to him with a concerned look on her face.<p>"Ranma what's wrong?" Akane asked him still half asleep.<p>"It was only a dream. It was only a dream." Akane could hear Ranma tell himself over and over.<p>"A dream?" Akane wondered a bit more awake this time.<p>"More like a nightmare." Ranma replied sounding scared.<p>"Tell me about it." Akane said as she held Ranma close to her.<p>For the next ten minutes Ranma told Akane every bit of the dream he could remember. Akane listened intently giving him reassuring pats on the head to let him know everything would be all right. And when Ranma had finished recounting his dream Akane looked him in the eyes.<p>"That was some dream to make you scream like that. But that's all it was a dream. Now why don't we try and get back to sleep." Akane said lovingly.<p>********<p>School the next day had Ranma wanting to maim Kuno for trying to not only come on to him but Akane as well. If he was a pervert before then this put him in the category of adulterer. Ranma was determined to put an end to this once and for all before it got too far out of hand.<p>Walking onto the school grounds Ranma didn't even wait for Kuno to make his entrance to seek out the perverted kendoist.<p>"Kuno! Show yourself!" Ranma yelled at the top of his lungs.<p>The crowd that had gathered to see what Ranma and Kuno would do before school parted like the Red Sea in order to allow Kuno passage. The captain of the kendo team came walking up to Ranma with his sword at the ready.<p>"What is it lecherous Saotome?" Kuno demanded to know.<p>"You've gone too far Kuno. I heard what you did yesterday. You tried to seduce a married woman. You tried to seduce my wife Kuno! I thought you were a pervert before but this takes the cake." Ranma hissed at the kendoist.<p>"I will never recognize your marriage to Akane Tendo you letch!" Kuno shot back.<p>With that Kuno rushed Ranma with his boken firmly planted in his hands and tried to take a swing at the cursed martial artist. Ranma decided to end the match by jumping into the air and planting a well-placed foot to Kuno's head. The captain of the kendo team was soon kissing the ground.<p>"That's three Kuno." Ranma said as he headed for the school building with Akane in tow.<p>********<p>Kuno had once again sought out Nabiki Tendo before class began. This time Nabiki was drinking a carton of milk not really caring what went on around her. Kuno walked over to Nabiki's desk and dropped two little stuffed pandas with bows around their necks on her desk. Looking down at the pandas Nabiki wondered what it was all about.<p>"What's this?" she asked him curiously.<p>"A present." Kuno replied with his back turned on her.<p>"Not my style." Nabiki stated sounding disinterested.<p>"Did I say it was for you Nabiki Tendo." Kuno said as he turned to come face to face with her, "That is for my water born goddess and fiery spirit."<p>Nabiki tried hard not to laugh at the situation. Kuno was playing the part of the lovesick idiot perfectly. He would do anything if it dealt with his water born goddess or his fiery spirit. Whipping out a set of photographs Nabiki went in for the kill.<p>"Set of five for three thousand yen." Nabiki said as she laid them out like a deck of cards.<p>The pictures that lay before Kuno were candid photos of Ranma in his cursed form. One was taken while Kasumi was watering the flowers in the garden and she had accidentally squirted Ranma with the hose. Another was taken just after Ranma's father had thrown him into the koi pond and the pigtailed martial artist was taking off his wet shirt. The look on her own father's face in the background was the icing on the cake. Others were taken while Ranma was trying to keep cool.<p>"So beautiful." Kuno whispered hungrily.<p>"You know you really are something going after two married women at once." Nabiki commented as she watched Kuno drool over the photos.<p>"Akane is a goddess of fire and she is a goddess of water." Kuno continued.<p>"It's your funeral." Nabiki said whipping out five more photos.<p>Nabiki placed the photos on the table in the same fashion as the prior ones.<p>"Set of five for three thousand yen." Nabiki told him in her business like tone.<p>Kuno looked down at the photos and saw they were of Akane running through her katas. Each photo depicted the complicated katas of the anything goes style as though they were a beautiful dance.<p>"So beautiful yet so fierce." Kuno whispered in the same hungry tone.<p>After looking over all ten photos Kuno reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet taking out six thousand yen and placing it on the desk in front of Nabiki.<p>"Sold." He said as he slammed the money down.<p>"You really are something Kuno." Nabiki commented again as she counted the money.<p>********<p>Ranma and Akane spent their study period trying to do just that. The young couple was finding it hard to focus with the Kuno situation hanging over their heads. As they continued to stare down at their books the door to the classroom slid open and Nabiki poked her head into the room.<p>"Ranma!" Nabiki called out, "Kuno wants to see you."<p>Everyone turned their heads wondering what the Ice Queen wanted with the new guy.<p>"What does that creep want now?" Akane quietly wondered from her seat.<p>Ranma followed Nabiki out the classroom door and down the hall to the outside stairway. Opening the door Nabiki gestured for Ranma to wait on the landing for Kuno. Leaning back against the wall Ranma waited for Kuno to arrive when he saw two small black and white burs head his way. Catching the blurs Ranma looked down to see two identical stuffed pandas.<p>"Tell me why I must give those to you." Kuno demanded.<p>"Come again?" Ranma questioned him quite confused.<p>"Tell me why. Quoth Nabiki Tendo 'If you wish to give these pandas to my sister and your water born goddess then you must give them to Ranma Saotome.' How do you know my water born goddess?" Kuno demanded to know getting in Ranma's face.<p>Ranma backed off and took a deep breath before answering Kuno.<p>"Forget about them Kuno. I don't want you near my wife and if you think you'll see the red head again you're sorely mistaken. If I have my way you'll never see her again." Ranma said as he walked away from the stairway.<p>Ranma rounded the corner of the building not entirely paying attention to his surroundings and soon he found himself at the wrong place at the wrong time as a wall of water was dumped on his head. With a frustrated growl Ranma ducked behind a nearby bush. And from behind said bush he could hear Kuno yelling something.<p>"What do you mean never see her again!" Kuno demanded rather loudly.<p>"Show yourself Saotome!" Kuno yelled as he began slashing at nearby trees and bushes.<p>Ranma tried to make his escape and get some hot water but failed miserably.  As he tried to sneak out of the bush Ranma tripped and fell flat on his face right in front of Kuno.<p>"My water born goddess oh how I have missed y…" Kuno said when he saw Ranma.<p>"Back off pervert." Ranma replied as he gave Kuno a right to the face.<p>Kuno then grabbed Ranma in his arms and pulled him close to him.<p>"I shall never let you go." Kuno declared.<p>It was then while in Kuno's arms that Ranma got splashed with water again. Only this time the water was boiling hot.<p>"Yeeeooouuch!" Ranma cried out.<p>"Oh sorry Ranma I didn't realize it was too hot." Nabiki said trying to look innocent.<p>When the name Nabiki spoke sank in Kuno's face got a real funny look to it.<p>"Ranma?" Kuno said in disbelief.<p>"Okay honey time to let go!" Ranma replied as he planted a foot in Kuno's face.<p>With that Ranma turned and walked away from fight.<p>"Don't you get it now you pervert." Ranma said over his shoulder.<p>Whether it was because he had a dense head or because he was delusional Kuno just didn't get the connection between Ranma and his water born goddess.<p>"Stand fast Saotome!" Kuno ordered him.<p>Ranma tried to get away before Kuno noticed him. But that was to no avail.  Kuno noticed the pigtailed martial artist over near Nabiki.<p>"Where have you hidden my goddess! I shall not be fooled by you!" Kuno yelled at him.<p>"Listen… Kuno…" Ranma tried to explain.<p>"Hmm he just doesn't seem to get it unless someone spells it out for him." Nabiki mused.<p>With that Nabiki went over to Kuno and pulled him aside.<p>"Listen Kuno see that girl back there her body, her soul are all his. It's the same with Akane and the brown haired boy from the day you met her. You do know what I mean do you?" Nabiki explained.<p>All at once the words Nabiki had said to Kuno began to sink in. And when they hit his brain they were completely misinterpreted. Kuno erupted in a volcano of anger.<p>"Her soul and her body." Kuno repeated slowly.<p>Ever vigilant and ever delusional Kuno believed it was his right to save his goddess and Akane.<p>"You vile cur!" Kuno yelled as he tried to slash Ranma with his boken.<p>Once again Ranma leapt out of the way and landed in a nearby tree.<p>"You just don't get it do you pervert." Ranma commented.<p>"Silence you foul wretch!" Kuno yelled, "I can see it all now you and your vile partner taking advantage of Akane Tendo and the water born goddess. Enslaving them to do your bidding."<p>"Hey you have it all wrong you pervert!" Ranma yelled back.<p>"I, Tatewaki Kuno, shall free Akane Tendo and the water born goddess! I shall smite thee down with my mighty sword!" Kuno announced as he took more swings at Ranma.<p>It was at that point that Akane made her way to the area where Ranma and Kuno were going at it. Hiding behind one of the concrete fence posts Akane wondered what the argument was about this time.<p>"So then if you loose this fight you'll forget about them." Ranma said as he grabbed the boken.<p>Kuno was pushed back by Ranma spilling the photos he had purchased from Nabiki. Ranma landed on the ground and picked up the pictures looking at them. Right on top of the pile was the photo of a Ranma without his shirt on. Ranma then thumbed through all the photos and saw pictures of both him and Akane. Furious with Kuno Ranma wondered where he had gotten them.<p>"Where did you get these you pervert!" Ranma demanded, "Answer me!"<p>"You fiend! Even in the midst of battle you think lecherous thoughts." Kuno shot back, "You do not take me seriously!"<p>Kuno gave another strike with his boken forcing Ranma into a backwards summersault. Ranma rolled backwards and stopped right at her feet. Akane just looked down at her husband.<p>"What's going on here Ranma?" she wanted to know.<p>"Can't talk right now I have a pervert to stop." Ranma said just before he leapt back to his feet.<p>Ranma then leapt into the air performing a double flip landing at Kuno's feet. The kendoist decided to end their match.<p>"This ends now vile cur!" Kuno declared.<p>With that Kuno pulled back his sword and began to strike Ranma over and over again. The blade of the wooden sword moved so fast it could barely be seen. As Kuno continued his assault with the blade the concrete post began to crack and shattered into what seemed like a million tiny pieces. Nabiki and Akane were stunned by what they had seen.<p>"Whoa he did that with just the air pressure." Nabiki said quite amazed at what she saw.<p>"Out of the way Akane!" Ranma yelled over his shoulder when he saw she was vulnerable.<p>Akane saw Kuno going for another strike and warned Ranma.<p>"Ranma eyes front!" she yelled.<p>Ranma quickly turned his attention back to the fight at hand. Using the speed techniques he learned from Ku Lon Ranma's foot struck Kuno on the chest and head. When it was all over with Kuno fell to the ground with Ranma in a now torn shirt standing over him with a deadly glare on his face.<p>"How in the world did he do that?" Nabiki wanted to know quite shocked at what she saw.<p>"Each strike hit a vulnerable spot." Akane explained as she turned Kuno over.<p>Akane walked over to Ranma to see if he was okay and find out what the fight was all about.<p>"You okay Ranma?" Akane asked quite concerned.<p>"Yeah I'll live." Ranma replied with a small smile.<p>"What was that all about?" Akane wanted to know.<p>"Kuno was still living in his sick little dream world." Ranma explained as he pulled out the pictures from his pocket.<p>Akane saw Ranma looking at the pictures and wondered where he had gotten them.<p>"What are those Ranma?" Akane asked trying to look over his shoulder.<p>"Oh this? Just something the pervert had." Ranma told her.<p>Akane grabbed the photos from Ranma's hands and saw the one on top. It was a picture of her in the middle of one of her workouts at the dojo. All in all Akane saw five photos of her and five of Ranma.<p>"That creep deserves everything he got." Akane commented, "Wonder where he got these things in the first place?"<p>Upon hearing her sister's question Nabiki began to nervously back away from the area.<p>"Uh…I was uh…just making a little money." Nabiki said nervously.<p>"My own sister! How could you!" Akane yelled.<p>"Busted." Ranma commented.<p>********<p>And that as they say is that. Well another episode comes to a close. I'd like to thank everyone who has been reading and reviewing this story especially Mwhalek. I've got plenty of suggestions to use in upcoming episodes to consider from him. Who knew I'd get over twenty reviews in one weekend. I'd also like to thank the geniuses that run the Ranma ½ Perfect Edition again. Without those guys we wouldn't have such a great looking thorough site. It is the site I will be using for all my Ranma needs.<p>Kuno has now arrived on the scene in grand style. And if you thought he had mental problems before this time he's really messed up this time. As you can see Kuno doesn't believe Ranma and Akane's marriage is legal or even valid for that matter. Nabiki did warn him he was dealing with married women. Now Kuno thinks Akane's cursed form is enslaving Akane while just like in the canon world Ranma is enslaving his female side. That boy needs psychiatric treatment. He'll be a pain in their sides for some time to come. Oh and in case you're wondering I pulled the basic story line for this episode right from the manga and changed it to fit the story.<p>Now on a personal note I just received a picture via e-mail from my neighbor and aunt that my cousin who is my age sent to her from the war. His group has been doing night flying and one of his buddies shot a picture of him flying against the mountains just as the sun is breaking over their peaks. Two words came to mind when I saw the picture oh wow. But enough on that subject it is now twenty-five days and counting until one of my favorite things in the entire world begins the Olympics (yea). These games sort of remind me of the story line in Akira. You know first Olympics after an event that leaves a big hole in a major city. Eerily similar or just a coincidence you decide. Anyhoo, I hope we win a lot of medals because we need it right now. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if an Osmond (sp?) or two is used in the opening ceremonies along with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir seeing as how they are from Utah. I also wouldn't be surprised to see one NFL great Steve Young there too if he can make it seeing as how he is related to Brigham Young the founder of Salt Lake City.  But enough of that for now.<p>So what's up next and who's coming next? Say hello to Ryouga Hibiki. How did Ranma and Akane meet Ryouga and what happened to him in China? Also, why does he have a sudden craving for panda stakes? Find out the answers to these questions and see if Nabiki likes Ranma any better in The Journey episode five: The Hunter's Curse.
