</div>Akane was determined not to let Kodachi Kuno, the Black Rose of St. Herbeke and little sister to Tatewaki Kuno, win the upcoming rhythmic gymnastics match. Not only was she defending the honor of the Furinkan High Rhythmic Gymnastics team she was also defending the hand of her husband. Somehow Ranma became the prize in the upcoming match and Akane was determined not to let Kodachi have him. And so for the remainder of the week she practiced every chance she could get.<p>Akane was making real progress with her gymnastics and the night before the match she decided to have a final workout to prepare for her opponent. And with Ryouga not around Akane settled for the next best training partner she could find. Ranma soon found himself the target of many attacks in the dojo.<p>Ranma sat and watched as Akane worked with the clubs. Her form had improved and she was showing a vast improvement from the first time she had tried to use them. Akane began by performing a graceful maneuver before leaping into the air and swinging the clubs down right in front of Ranma who rolled out of the way to avoid being hit. Frustrated Akane glared at her husband before grabbing the ribbon and whipping it at him. Again Ranma avoided the attack and this time leapt out of the way.<p>"Hold still and let me practice on you Ranma." Akane said as she picked up the heavy ball.<p>Whacking the ball like a volleyball serve Akane once again tried hitting Ranma only to have the ball hit the ceiling and bounce to the floor below.<p>"I'm not about to lose to that Kodachi person." Akane told him.<p>"I know that." Ranma replied.<p>"But this happens to be martial rhythmic gymnastics so I need a partner to practice." She said, "And Ryouga hasn't been around for the last few days and I was counting on him too."<p>As if on cue Ryouga in her cute and cuddly pig form came trotting into the Dojo with a couple of boxes on her back. Akane noticed the lost boy and smiled at him.<p>"Speak of the devil we were just wondering about you." She said to him.<p>"I wonder where pig boy's been this time?" Ranma mused as he took the boxes off Ryouga's back, "Cinnamon crackers from Hiroshima and tea cakes from Kyoto. Where were you trying to go to this time P-chan? What a lousy sense of direction."<p>"He can't help it Ranma." Akane commented, "I'm assuming he wants to pay Kasumi a little visit before helping us out here which explains the pig form."<p>Akane set Ryouga down and let the lost boy head off to the house to see Kasumi for a while. The eldest Tendo daughter had gotten used to the idea of having him around the house during the day and was a bit depressed when he was nowhere to be found. Akane had assured her sister that her P-chan would return on her own to the house.<p>"Are we gonna practice or what?" Ranma wondered.<p>With that said Akane picked up a set of clubs and charged towards Ranma who now had a hoop in her hands. Ranma dodged the clubs moments before Akane grabbed the rope with her toes lifting it to her free hand. Akane then discarded the clubs and began to use the rope like a whip. Ranma held up the hoop in a defensive position in front of himself in order to be able to stop the rope and wrap it around the hoop. After performing one of the standard rhythmic gymnastics moves on the practice mat Akane leapt into the air and was about to use the rope to bind Ranma while landing in front of him. But she had miscalculated her landing and had failed to notice the ball on the floor. Akane landed on top of the ball, which rolled right out from under her the moment she touched it. The foot on the ball happened to be the same one she had twisted the day Ryouga first arrived at the dojo. Akane ended up flat on her face and her ankle was once again rendered useless.<p>********<p>Akane sat on her bed dressed in a t-shirt and a pair of Ranma's shorts that luckily had a drawstring on them looking down at her now wrapped left ankle and bandaged right knee. Kasumi was putting away the first aid kit while Ranma and Nabiki sat and waited for Kasumi to finish. This was on of the times Kasumi was glad she had borrowed the first aid books from Dr. Tofu.<p>"Who'd have thought my sister would have a klutz attack?" Nabiki said almost not believing the night's events had even taken place.<p>"Jeez Nabiki everyone is entitled to make a mistake every now and then." Ranma said defending her wife's skill in the arts.<p>Even though Ranma and Akane were pretty well even when it came to Anything Goes there were some areas where they were both lacking and others where one was better than the other. Rhythmic gymnastics happened to be one area they hadn't quite gotten the hang of on the road. And with Genma preaching her weapons are for weaklings theory everyday they rarely used them until they reached the Amazon village. It was there that they were thrown head first into the intense world of Amazon armed combat. And by the time they left the village a year and a half later they had both picked up a few new tricks and skills along with a better understanding of themselves and their curses.<p>"You know Akane with that ankle the way it is you have no choice but to withdraw from the match." Kasumi said out of concern not realizing the effect the comment would have.<p>"There is no way I'm going to give up. If I do that I would dishonor the team, the entire school, and myself." Akane argued as she sat on the side of the bed.<p>Ranma looked over at her wife and saw the look of determination on her face. He had seen that look several times before during their time in China. It was a look that told the world she wasn't a quitter and would keep going until she reached her goal. It was one of the things he loved about her Akane never gave up unless she had a valid reason.<p>"If anyone wants me I'll be in the dojo." Akane said just before she put her feet on the ground and went to stand up.<p>The moment her weight was on her twisted ankle Akane winced in pain and pointed to the crutches standing in the corner of the room. Ranma grabbed them and handed them to her wife just as the tears began to fall down her face. Ranma knew Akane was going to have to do the one thing she didn't like doing, give up.<p>"Everyone on the team is going to hate me." Akane said through her tears, "There's no way we can find someone who knows both rhythmic gymnastics and martial arts at this late hour."<p>With those words said the eyes of the room fell on a now nervous Ranma. Sure he had gotten used to being a girl sometimes and it added for interesting moments in the bed but Ranma just couldn't get used to wearing women's clothes no matter how hard Akane, Ku Lon, and Xian Pu had tried back in the village. With a nervous gulp Ranma tried to make a hasty retreat from her room only to be stopped by the strong grip of one Ryouga Hibiki.<p>"I'm not wearing tights. No way no how." Ranma protested just before Ryouga dumped the entire contents of a bucket of cold water on her head.<p>"If anyone needs us we'll be in the dojo. We have a long night ahead of us." Ryouga said as he dragged a very reluctant Ranma out of the room.<p>********<p>The Journey<br/>Episode Seven: Ranma Vs. The Black Rose<p>********<p>Ranma, now dressed in the red version of the leotard Akane wore, stood across from Ryouga holding a set of clubs and a red and white hoop. Ryouga was casually twirling a blue rope in her hands while Akane, now wearing a blue wind shirt over her t-shirt, sat in one corner watching the practice session. Ranma thought this session would be just like every other sparing match she had been in.<p>"Since the match is tomorrow the only way you're going to master the techniques is to experience them in a real battle. So that means I'm not going to be going easy on you Saotome. Are you ready?" Ryouga said.<p>"Ha! I was born ready." Ranma replied.<p>With that Ranma rushed Ryouga preparing to make the first move. Ryouga had stopped twirling the doubled over rope and took it between both hands.<p>"Attack from any direction you…" Ryouga said before being cut off by Ranma's foot to her face.<p>"That was easy." Ranma commented looking over at Akane.<p>With an angry growl Ryouga recovered quickly and used the rope to trip up Ranma sending him to the ground in a less than graceful manner.<p>"Use the tools you dolt!" Ryouga yelled at the sprawled out form of Ranma.<p>Ranma, like Ryouga, quickly recovered and took the ribbon in her hands. Looking at the red and white piece of satin the pigtailed martial artist gave a small sigh before making a comment on the situation.<p>"Well if I must then I guess I'll have to use this thing." Ranma commented to no one in particular.<p>Ranma picked up the clubs and looked Ryouga right in the eyes before giving him a curt nod to let the lost boy he was ready to go at it for real this time. The last time Ranma had forgotten she was to use the equipment as a part of her attacks. Ending up flat on her back quickly reminded her of that fact.<p>"Hokay. From the top. Here I come!" Ranma said just before he attacked Ryouga.<p>Akane watched as Ranma was able to keep Ryouga on her toes and actually connect a few hits to the lost boy. Ryouga then countered with the rope knocking the ribbon out of the way. Seeing an opening Ranma went into the maneuvers of a low sweeper and took the hoop on the floor between her toes to kick Ryouga out of the way. Ryouga jumped back and grabbed a nearby club and went to swing it at Ranma's head. Ranma blocked the club with her own clubs before knocking Ryouga's club out of her hands. The two martial artists gave up on using the clubs any further and picked up the ribbons. The two rivals began whipping out silent insults at each other with a clever turn of the wrist spelling out words with the ribbons. Ranma had called Ryouga a worm and in return Ryouga called Ranma a dog. All in all Akane was pretty impressed with the level of skill her husband was showing.<p>"Wow Ranma you're pretty good." Akane commented.<p>"Hey I didn't spend all week watching you practice for noth…." Ranma replied just before he was hit in the face by an incoming ball.<p>"You don't even need to practice." Akane said.<p>"Yes I do." Ranma told her as she rubbed her very sore nose.<p>Ranma then prepared for another attack while twirling her ribbon in a small spiral pattern.<p>"Why don't you head off to bed." Ranma said to Akane.<p>"I couldn't." Akane replied.<p>"Afraid I'll get hurt?" she asked her.<p>"No, that's not it." She said.<p>"Don't worry Akane I'll make certain Ranma learns everything he needs to know for tomorrows match." Ryouga told her.<p>"Alright, if you say so." Akane said before grabbing her crutches and heading off to bed.<p>Dressed in her usual bedtime attire Akane climbed under the covers thinking about the skill Ranma had displayed earlier. She had always known Ranma could pick up a new skill quickly while it took her a bit of time. But it still took her by surprise when she actually saw it happen each time. If he fights this well tomorrow he's bound to win the match, Akane thought before sleep overtook her.<p>********<p>When Akane awoke the next morning the first thing she noticed was the empty spot next to her in the bed. It became immediately obvious to her that Ranma had never come to bed the night before. He'll never win if he's a walking zombie, Akane thought as she put on her robe. Hobbling out to the dojo on her crutches Akane wanted to confirm her suspicions before having breakfast. Opening the door to the dojo Akane saw Ranma and Ryouga still going at it. Ranma was currently beating on Ryouga with her hoop. The two rivals looked very tired and disheveled. Ranma had cuts in her leotard and her hair was all mussed up. Ryouga was the living embodiment of being dead tired with bags under her eyes and messy hair. The dojo looked no better with ceiling tiles close to falling to the floor, holes all over the place, and several clubs imbedded in the walls.<p>"Take that and that and that and that! Had enough yet!" Akane heard Ranma yell at Ryouga.<p>"Never! Never! Never!" Ryouga yelled back.<p>"Don't tell me you've been at it all night?" Akane wanted to know.<p>"Huh? Wha'? Morning awready?" Ranma asked with a foggy brain from lack of sleep.<p>"Are you going to be okay for the match today?" Akane wondered.<p>"No problem. No broplem. Pro noblem. Plo robnem. Blo noprem." Ranma replied very tired.<p>At breakfast that morning Ranma was so tired he couldn't think straight and began mistaking things for food. Picking up a towel Ranma began eating it thinking it was one of the fish cakes Kasumi had prepared for breakfast that morning.<p>"Kasumi this fish cake is tough." Ranma said half out of it.<p>"Oh my. Ranma that's a towel." Kasumi told her.<p>Akane hung her head low and slapped her forehead with her had as she shook her head. We are so doomed, she thought; if I haven't lost my honor yet I'll loose it today.<p>********<p>Two Saturdays out of every month students in Japan were required to attend a half-day of classes and this particular Saturday happened to be one of them. It was also the day the match between Akane and Kodachi was scheduled to take place. And as Akane led a still half asleep Ranma through the halls of St. Heberke School for Girls an announcement was made over the loud speakers.<p>"Today at one o'clock in gymnasium two there will be a martial rhythmic gymnastics match. This match is the scheduled match between Furinkan High and our own team from St. Heberke." The female voice announced over the speakers.<p>Akane and Ranma made their way towards the gymnasium set up for the match. Ranma had a hand on Akane's shoulder so he wouldn't fall over from being overly tired. The pair of females had spotted Kodachi still in her school uniform standing in the hall and went over to inform her of the change in competitors from Furinkan.<p>"A substitute?" Kodachi questioned them after hearing Akane wasn't going to participate.<p>"Well as you can plainly see I messed up my ankle so there's no way I can compete. This girl will be taking my place." Akane explained.<p>Kodachi took a good look at the girl next to Akane and noticed she looked quite out of it and had bags under her eyes. But what surprised her the most was the fact that she recognized her from a week before the match. This was the same girl who had stood up to her along with Akane.<p>"So we meet again pig tailed girl." Kodachi commented.<p>With that Kodachi stretched out her hand to show there were no hard feelings between them in an effort to shake hands with Ranma.<p>"May the best girl win." Kodachi said.<p>Ranma, still quite out of it, didn't quite register what Kodachi wanted to do fast enough to respond right away. The momentary break in the action was all Akane needed to expose what Kodachi was about to attempt. Turning over Kodachi's hand Akane revealed three tacks between her fingers.<p>"How did these get there?" Kodachi said trying to look innocent.<p>With that a frustrated Akane led Ranma to the locker room set up for the Furinkan team.<p>********<p>"You can't let your guard down for a single second Ranma." Akane said, discussing strategy, as Ranma prepared for the match.<p>Akane pulled a few things out of the gym bag she had brought with them that she would need during the match and looked the room over. On one of the tables sat a fish tank and what appeared to be a bouquet of flowers. Going over to the table Akane looked at the flowers. The card attached to them said they were from the Black Rose and wished her competitor good luck.<p>"Hmm, black roses." Akane said as she removed one from the bouquet.<p>Akane stuck the rose into the water and was surprised to see the fish float to the top. After a careful examination Akane could still see the gills moving on the fish and concluded they were asleep.<p>"Sleeping potion." Akane said.<p>Ranma came over and looked at the sleeping fish.<p>"Wow Kuno was right about her." Ranma commented.<p>********<p>Said kendoist was seated amongst the throngs of people that had come to the large gym to witness the match between the Black Rose and the Furinkan champion. All along the upper balconies were banners and signs touting the praises of Kodachi Kuno. No one had any idea who she would be competing against just that she was to compete that day. Usually most teams gave up before the match even began.<p>Kuno hadn't come to the match to cheer on her sister or to make wagers on who would win like Nabiki he came to make certain Akane Tendo would come out of the match unharmed. Nabiki had noticed Kuno at the match while taking bets and figured he was there to support her sister. She didn't realize he wanted to make certain her sister's foul deeds didn't cause any permanent damage to her competition he just didn't realize her competition would now be her Water Born Goddess.<p>"Well, well elder brother." Kuno heard from behind him.<p>Turning in the direction of the voice the kendoist saw her sister in her usual competition leotard and robe. Looking closer at Kodachi it looked as though she were hiding something under her robe.<p>"Greetings younger sister." Kuno said as though they barely saw one another.<p>The girls sitting near Kuno took note of the fact that he was Kodachi's brother while the guys from Furinkan just shrugged it off.<p>"Kodachi's brother is here." One girl said.<p>"He's so fine." Another commented.<p>"Did you hear that she's Kuno's sister." One boy said.<p>"Ignorance is bliss." The other boy added.<p>It was at this point that a young woman, dressed like American boxing announcer Michael Boufer, took her place in the center of the ring with microphone in hand. Raising her free hand to the referee got things under way.<p>"And now the champions of the schools!" she said.<p>With that Kodachi climbed into the ring while Ranma and Akane took their places.<p>"In this corner the pride of St. Heberke School for Girls. The captain of the Rhythmic Gymnastics team the Black Rose Kodachiiiii Kuuuuno!" the young woman announced.<p>The crowd went wild when they heard Kodachi's name. Most of the audience gathered for the match attended the home school and wanted Kodachi to win. After a few moments the announcer continued her job.<p>"And in this corner her opponent the champion of Furinkan High…" She began before realizing she didn't know the challenger's name, "Hey what's you name?"<p>Ranma looked over at the announcer realizing they had been expecting Akane up until last night. With a sigh she gave the ref her name.<p>"Ranma Saotome." She said thinking nothing of it.<p>"Ranma do you think you should be using you real name?" Akane wanted to know.<p>"Don't worry Akane." Ranma replied.<p>The announcer then picked up right where she had left off.<p>"The champion of Furinkan High Raaaaaanma Saotomeeeee!" she said.<p>The whole crowd was abuzz when they heard Ranma's name. The Furinkan contingent couldn't believe there was another Ranma out there. While at the same time Kuno was overjoyed to know that he finally had learned the name of her Water Born Goddess.<p>"Did you hear that her name is Ranma Saotome." One student said.<p>"That girl's name is Ranma Saotome." The Kunos said at the same time.<p>"How strange that the same name given to a girl would sound so vile." Kodachi then said.<p>"I must never forget her name." Kuno added as he wrote it down on the screen of his PDA.<p>"You know it has happened before two strangers with the same first and last name." A student commented to the first one.<p>"Yeah but she sort of looks like Saotome except for the red hair." The first one replied.<p>"Well strangers can look alike." The second student added.<p>"See." Ranma said to a very shocked Akane.<p>"Champions to the center." The referee said.<p>The two competitors then came to the center of the ring in order to receive their instructions.<p>"Today martial arts rhythmic gymnastics. The rules the match ends when one girl is knocked out or falls out of the ring. Barehanded hits to your opponent are not allowed. Shake hands please." The referee instructed them.<br/>Ranma held out her hand to shake Kodachi's but before she could she caught her off guard.<p>"Hey what's that?" she said using the oldest trick in the book.<p>"Huh?" Ranma wondered as she looked in the direction her finger indicated.<p>Kodachi took advantage of her distraction and clamped something to Ranma's wrist. The pig tailed martial artist felt the extra weight and looked down to see a certain black pig attacked to the end of the chain. Raising the chain to eye level Ranma glared at the pig.<p>"What are you doing here Ryouga?" Ranma wanted to know.<p>"Let's get ready to rumbleeeeee!" the referee said starting the match.<p>"Keep your cool Ryouga or I'll be forced to beat your brains out." Ranma said to the lost boy just before the match got underway.<p>Ranma then turned to face her opponent.<p>"I don't like beating up on people so I'll knock you out of the ring before you get hurt." She said.<p>"How sweet of you to show your concern." Kodachi said with a small sneer.<p>The play-by-play commentator from St. Heberke began calling the match between Ranma and Kodachi Kuno the Black Rose.<p>********<p>This is it folks the match between the Black Rose and the champion of the Furinkan High team. And it looks as though Kodachi will be making the first move. Just what we've come to expect from the flower of martial rhythmic gymnastics, she handles the rope as if it were a rod. Wait a minute! It is a rod! A rod disguised as a rope! Kodachi connects with a blow to Saotome's head.<p>"That's against the rules ref!" Akane complained.<p>"As long as it's not a bare handed blow it's valid." The ref told her.<p>Kodachi switches from using the rope to her clubs and lunges towards Ranma Saotome with her club. But Ranma is able to dodge the blow to the head with incredible speed. It looks as though something has come out of the club. It appears to be retractable spikes!<p>"Ref that club has spikes!" Akane complained.<p>"I don't see any spikes." The ref said mere moments after Kodachi retracted them.<p>"A club with retractable spikes. What magnificent cowardice if I may say so about my own sister." Kuno commented from the stands.<p>"I do all of this so I may date my Lord Ranma." Kodachi said in the ring.<p>"I tell you I'm married!" Ranma yelled as she leapt into the air using Ryouga as a part of her attack.<p>An ingenious pig attack from Saotome! Is a pig a valid weapon?<p>"Use of pig valid." The head judge said.<p>It appears as if the challenger Saotome is saying something to Kodachi. And whatever Saotome said has Kodachi angry. Kodachi thrusts her club at Saotome once again who uses the chain holding the pig to her wrist to block the attack.<p>"Hoop." Kodachi called to her second.<p>"Hoop coming up." The second replied before tossing the black and white hoop into the ring.<p>Kodachi has called for her hoop. And in a great display of grace and agility Kodachi has tossed her hoop at Saotome using nothing but her wrist. Saotome dodges the hoop but the corner post of ring suffers great damage as it is cut down to size by the razor sharp hoop.<p>"A razor blade." Akane commented.<p>Now it looks as though Kodachi is going to use her ribbon to attack Saotome. But wait the Black Rose has used her ribbon to grab her hoop and pull it back into the ring and use it against Saotome. Ranma dodges the hoop in an amazing display of flexibility through the use of a back bend. Ranma knocks away the hoop by using the chain as a jump rope and lands on the ropes of the ring!<p>"Ow! Ryouga you idiot! If you want to make it out of here alive then you'll cooperate." Ranma yelled after Ryouga had bitten her.<p>It seems as though that pig is not very happy to be used as a weapon in this match and takes it out in Saotome. Taking advantage of Saotome's lapse in concentration champion Kodachi Kuno uses her ribbon once again to attack her opponent. In a great display of dexterity Saotome leaps out of the way of the ribbon and lands once again on the ropes.<p>"Akane, the ribbon!" Ranma yelled to Akane.<p>Calling out to her second for a ribbon challenger Saotome prepares for champion Kuno's next attack. With a serious expression on her face Kodachi whips her ribbon out of the ring to grab something. Yes Kodachi Kuno has snagged her own brother with her ribbon! What an exciting match!<p>"Hey ref that can't be right!" Akane yelled.<p>"Use of brother legal." The ref announced.<p>With the call saying that popular kendoist Tatewaki Kuno can be used in the match challenger Saotome looks around for something to use to counter the attack. Whipping her ribbon out of the ring challenger Saotome grabs the official bell and whips it into the face of champion Kuno's brother. That looks painful but let me assure you ladies that Tatewaki Kuno will be just fine. With the champion's brother safely back amongst the spectators the two combatants continue at it once more.<p>"You shall never win and Lord Ranma will be mine you vile creature!" Kodachi yelled at Ranma.<p>"Can't you get it through your thick skull that Ranma is a married man!" Ranma yelled back.<p>Champion Kuno lashes out at the challenger Saotome with one of her clubs. In another amazing feat of dexterity Saotome leaps out of the way of the club. Using her ribbon the challenger grabs the announcer's table and uses it to deflect the attacks of the Champion. But what's this there's a panda in the arena with a steaming kettle of hot water. The panda tosses the kettle into the ring hitting the challenger and the pig attached to her. If Saotome falls out of the ring then Kodachi Kuno will win the match. Saotome's second runs to the fire hose and turns on the water spraying both the challenger and what now appears to be a naked man. And what's this it looks as though challenger Saotome is actually swimming up the water spray back into the ring. Saotome once again gives the crowd an incredible display of martial arts prowess.<p>Back in the ring once more challenger Saotome rushes towards Champion Kuno with her own clubs brandished. Saotome has the champion pushed back towards the ropes. Jumping onto the ropes Champion Kuno tries to avoid the attacks of the challenger. Champion Kuno lets her hoop fly towards the challenger and raising the chain on her wrist Saotome not only deflects the attack but frees herself from being chained to the pig. But it seems as though the challenger is not going to give up and has the Champion teetering close to the edge. Can Champion Kuno avoid falling out of the ring ending the match? Jumping high into the air both contestants try to knock the other one out of the ring. It looks as though challenger Saotome has come closest to accomplishing this feat. But wait it's not over yet. Champion Kuno lets out a whistle and somehow the ring has moved allowing her to land safely on the canvas.<p>"She's cheating! There's no way that ring could have moved on its own." Akane complained.<p>Once again the challenger and the Champion go at it again. Both gymnasts leap high into the air and once again the challenger has put the Champion into a bind with the use of her hoop. And once again the Champion whistles and the ring moves magically under her. How she's able to do this no one knows.<p>"The next time she does this I'm going to put an end to it." Ranma said to Akane.<p>"You better use the clubs again." Akane replied.<p>With clubs in hand Saotome tries her attack one more time. For the third time the two contestants leap high into the air. And for the third time Champion Kuno is in a spot of trouble. With a whistle she calls for the ring to come to her aid once more. But before the Champion can land back into the ring the challenger comes down upon the mat with a force so great it literally rips the canvas into shreds. And using great dexterity both the challenger and the Champion land on the corner posts of the ring. With the canvas gone it appears the secret of the moving ring has been revealed to be the rest of the St. Heberke's Rhythmic Gymnastics squad. The match now comes down to this whoever falls off the posts first will lose. Can Champion Kuno keep her balance?<p>"Ribbon!" Kodachi called out to her second.<p>With ribbon in hand Champion Kuno whips it at the challenger who avoids being hit by every single strike. One must wonder where the challenger learned such great balance. The challenger uses her clubs to strike at Kuno by whipping them like throwing daggers at her. Champion Kuno avoids the attack and gets her hoop from her second. With hoop in hand Champion Kuno flings it towards the challenger. The hoop cuts through the post but the challenger leaps out of the way and lands on the now broken post displaying that incredible balance.<p>"I've only got one more shot at this Akane." Ranma said, "Give me the ball."<p>"I hope this works." Akane replied as she tossed the ball to Ranma.<p>It looks like the challenger is trying a new strategy. She now has the weighted ball. Tossing it high into the air the challenger spikes it like a volleyball sending it straight at the Champion. Champion Kuno leaps high into the air and deflects the ball sending back at the challenger. But wait what's this in another display of martial arts skill Saotome has leapt high into the air and using a roundhouse kick sent the ball back at Champion Kuno before landing back on her pole. Kuno doesn't seem to be able to stop the attack and is hit square in the chest by the ball. Trying to keep her balance on the pole Champion Kuno teeters on one foot on the edge close to falling off. Kuno desperately tries to regain her balance but fails falling off the pole.<p>"Kodachi Kuno has fallen out of the ring ending the match." The ref announced, "The winner from Furinkan High School, Ranma Saotome."<p>For the first time in her illustrious career Champion Kuno has lost her match.<p>********<p>Kodachi stood up and went over to where Ranma and Akane were currently celebrating the win with a big hug. They knew they couldn't kiss in public as girls but they could at least hug. Girls were known to hug in public to celebrate a joyous occasion and decided to celebrate more intimately later that night. Standing in front of the couple Kodachi extended her hand in order to shake Ranma's. And after a quick check to see that Kodachi didn't have anything hidden in it Ranma took it into her own.<p>"Congratulations on your win." Kodachi said, "As per the agreement Ranma is yours and I will no longer pursue him. But today I make a vow! Know this all who bare witness that I, Kodachi Kuno the Black Rose of St. Heberke's, will find a way to legally make Ranma Saotome my husband without using any of my usual tactics!"<p>Ranma looked at Kodachi as though she were crazy, which she just might have been. After agreeing to not go after Ranma as a part of the conditions of the bet she made with Akane Kodachi announced she would still go after Ranma. With a nervous swallow Ranma backed away from Kodachi and then turned to look at Kuno sitting in the stands with a smile on his face. Ranma wasn't certain how she was going to deal with both of the Kuno siblings now.<p>********<p>Dinner that night at the Tendo-ke was a joyous occasion. What would normally be a simple meal shared between the Tendos and Saotomes had turned into a victory celebration. Kasumi had decided, after hearing the good news, to create a special dessert in honor of Ranma's victory over Kodachi. As the Tendo sisters sat and ate their meal with the occasional smile to one another and the fathers drank a bottle of sake from Soun's small collection Ranma sat there and ate in silence. The aquatransexual martial artist thought back to the time he and Akane had spent with the Amazons in China and the situation that gave them a whole different perspective on honor. Once again Ranma had to step in to defend Akane's honor.<p>Hopefully that ugly situation is finally behind us, Ranma thought as he ate his udon noodles.<p>********<p>You wanted it and you got it. I resurrected The Journey. This episode goes out to my fellow creators of original Ranmaverse characters from the Rumic World board Dinozore, DragonOmega, Hasseman, and just because he knows what he likes Tofu San (AKA Spare). I'd also like to thank all the other nutty and wonderful people on the Rumic World Board who encourage me to continue to do the things I love to do.<p>As you can see there's something in Ranma's and Akane's past that makes them take the concept of honor very seriously. What it is has only been hinted at up until now. And fairly soon we will be diving into that past and the incident that turned them into husband and wife. But you're wondering how will she introduce that situation to us and when will she do it? The answer is simple, take a look at the next paragraph to find out.<p>So what's up next? The Tendo-ke is about to get a visitor. It's a visitor of the Chinese kind. In fact, it's two visitors. Mousse, that legally blind Chinese warrior, is going to come to the Tendo-ke touting his collection of hidden weapons, a swan shaped training potty, and a baby named Rin or Rinse if you please. Find out why Mousse is at the Tendo-ke playing Mr. Mom and just what happened to Ranma and Akane in Joketsuzoku in episode eight: Mousse's Visit: For Love and Honor.
