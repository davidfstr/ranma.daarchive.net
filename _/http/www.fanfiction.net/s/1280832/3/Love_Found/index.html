Their creators and the companies they work for and with own the characters and all that pertains to them. (I.E. Rumiko Takahashi, Viz, Shougakukan) This is just fans of the show expressing their love for it for fun, no profit is involved or expected thank you.<p>Revised on Apr. 6, 2004. Updated the grammar and spelling, plus made some fixes on dialogue and text.)<p>***********************<p>Chapter Three<p>Eavesdropping<p>Or<p>Answers And Misunderstandings<p>***************************<p>What Ranma and Kyoko said,<p>***************************<p>The two former fiancées became very self-conscious and the silence stretched on between them even after they sat down at the low table in Kyoko's room with their tea. That is until Ranma broke the eerie silence when he asked in a small voice when 'Ukyo' dyed her hair?<p>With a self-conscious pat of her hair she responded by saying that she actually just stopped dying it, that this was her natural color.<p>In a nervous voice Ranma replied that he never knew this, after this scintillating conversation the silence strengthened again until Kyoko finally exclaimed.<p>"OH, Your all wet" as she just noticed Ranma's dripping hair and clothing.<p>"It's all right" Ranma responded.<p>"No you'll catch your death," she said as she walked back over with a towel she had retrieved from the linen closet. Kyoko began to dry Ranma's hair for him much to his obvious embarrassment.<p>This continued on until slowly her hands began to stop. Then in a confused fashion she asked him while feeling his cool and damp hair, "Ranma?"<p>"Yes?"<p>"Your hair is wet."<p>"Yeeesss?" he replied not understanding the point.<p>"And the water is still cool from the rain?" the manager inquired.<p>"Yes?" Ranma confirmed.<p>"Uhm? How?" she asked confused.<p>"Oooh the curse," Ranma said with a sly grin.<p>"Yes the curse" Kyoko huffed.<p>"Easy, easy" Ranma tried to calm her down while he made soothing gesture. "How about, you have a seat and I'll explain how I got cured."<p>Obviously uneasy but still excited Kyoko sat down.<p>***********************<p>What the Maison crew heard,<p>***********************<p>Outside the door of the manager's room,<p>"What did they say?" Godai asked in a worried hiss.<p>"SHHH!" Shun shushed the younger man.<p>"Hey watch those hands buster!" Akemi warned as she felt a roaming hand.<p>"A . . . Ak . . . emi? When did you get down here?" Godai asked nervously, given that it was his hand that accidentally rested on her, ~cough, cough~ Posterior<p>"Wouldn't you like to know ya pervert!" Akemi glared back at him.<p>"Hey quiet down I can't hear them, what did they just say?" Ichinose exclaimed as she pressed her ear closer to the door.<p>"I believe I heard the manager say something about dying, and a curse? Very interesting, don't you think so Mrs. Ichinose." Yotsuya intoned with his usual sardonic wit.<p>"What could it mean?" The coach asked with a worried frown.<p>"It means my dear coach, that the scoundrel is plying the manager with some tale of his having an illness to get sympathy." Mr. Yotsuya replied in a grave manner.<p>"You think?" Godai asked starting to get freaked out.<p>"SSHH! I can't hear." Ichinose hissed as she leaned on the door.<p>***********************<p>What Ranma and Kyoko said,<p>***********************<p>"So Are you going to tell me or not?" Kyoko asked with a raised eyebrow.<p>"Alright, Here goes." After he took a deep breath Ranma began his tale of the last few years. He told her of how things had changed between him and Akane and he eventually told him of how she wanted a divorce. He told her of how he had wandered around lost with no real goal in mind. Till he eventually had ended up in a church where he made a friend who had helped him out. Ranma continued his tale, he told of how he moved into a motorcycle repair shop with another new friend, learning a bunch of different things. Till one day Ranma made a decision, he repented of his sins and asked Jesus into his life as his personal lord and savior.<p>"I went a week before I noticed that I hadn't changed, in fact I didn't even realize it at the time but it had been a week since I had last been splashed accidentally."<p>"This is to much, what had happened?" Kyoko asked enthralled.<p>"Well I eventually put it together that when I became a Christian, I asked God into my heart and something as pitiful as Jusenkyo had no hope of ever overpowering God."<p>"That's it?"<p>"Yeah that's why I'm cured and happier than I ever have been before. It took me a while to get it; you see when I found out the truth. I mean that there is one God in heaven and that he loves me, LOVES ME, enough to send his only son to die for the bad things I've done. Not just me though you, Akane even Pop and Happosai.<p>"I've never really thought much of religion," Kyoko said after a while.<p>"Hey you know I never did," Ranma said with a laugh. "But that all changed, I never knew I could feel this way. I'm so happy and at peace now, I have a relationship with God almighty, he loves me and cares about me and everything I am. Not only that but he wants the same for you U- Chan."<p>"This is a lot to take in Ranma. I, I"<p>"I know, U-Chan, I'm here if you want to talk about this later okay?"<p>"Yeah thanks Ran-Chan"<p>***********************<p>What the Maison crew heard,<p>***********************<p>"I still can't hear a thing." Godai muttered.<p>"I heard him mention 'motorcycles'." Shun said, sounding confused.<p>"He also said something about 'Loves Me', and 'relationships?'" Ichinose said confused.<p>"What can it all mean though?" Godai in a desperate whisper.<p>"Nothing good for the manager I imagine." Yotsuya said as he tried to stir up trouble.<p>***********************<p>What Ranma and Kyoko said,<p>***********************<p>After a period of silence during which Kyoko refilled their tea, She began to tell of what happened after she had left Nerima.<p>"I moved to a new area with my parents, yeah we reunited after I left." She said cutting off his questioning gaze.<p>"Then, well because of how things ended up between us and to satisfy honor.  We had to give up, not only our art but, . . ."<p>"What is it U-Chan?"<p>She swallowed hard as tears threatened in her eyes, "that's just it Ranma we had to change our names too, my mother's family took us onto their registry and my dad got a job as an salary man. He . . ." Kyoko's further comments were unintelligible as she broke down with sob.<p>Ranma rushed to her and held her in a tender embrace as she cried on his shoulder. After a minute she descended into a quiet series of hiccups till she blushed and sat back and she pulled away from him.<p>She looked down with an embarrassed face she tried to think of something to say but her thoughts were derailed when Ranma shocked her by saying.<p>"It's my fault."<p>"NO," she exclaimed as she held him by the shoulders "it isn't your fault."<p>"Yes it is, because of my selfishness your family lost everything."<p>"No Ran-Chan, I'm not saying that it didn't hurt, but before I blamed you for so long when it wasn't your fault that I was determined not to do that again. There was plenty of blame to go around, but it just wasn't meant to be."<p>Ranma looked into her eyes and saw her sincerity he smiled at her. "If you forgive me U-Ch . . . hey you said you changed your name?"<p>"Uhm, yeah?"<p>"Well what's your name now?"<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed and she stood up and with a smile she bowed to Ranma "Kyoko Otonashi pleased to meet you."<p>Ranma smiled back and bowed as well "Nice to meet you Kyoko, I'm Ranma Saotome."<p>After a good laugh at this series of antics Kyoko warned Ranma, "By the way, just in case if my father comes by you might want to make your self scarce."<p>Ranma nodded at that before he smiled at his friend that he hadn't seen in far too long.<p>***********************<p>What the Maison crew heard,<p>***********************<p>"I wish they would speak up." Coach Mitaka muttered.<p>"No kidding" Akemi frowned as she tried to hear more juicy gossip.<p>"Should we go in I think I hear her crying?" Godai exclaimed, as he began to grow frightened.<p>"Yes if he is hurting Ms. Otonashi we have to do something "the Coach, exclaimed in self-righteous fury.<p>"He she just said 'NO' you don't think he, . . ." Mrs. Ichinose asked in mock horror as she watched the kid and the coach grow more and more desperate.<p>"We have to help her," Godai exclaimed in desperation.<p>"No wait, is she laughing? Most intriguing these goings on." Mr. Yotsuya muttered as he tried to draw things out.<p>"Hey did anyone else hear him mention something about changing his name?" Akemi muttered still a little drunk even after she freshened up.<p>"SSSHH! They'll hear." Coach Mitaka whispered as the others began to get to loud.<p>***********************<p>What Ranma and Kyoko said,<p>***********************<p>The duo sat back down and smiled at each other. "You know it's nice to have a friend that I can talk to about these things, no one else here knows about this stuff," Kyoko said.<p>"Yeah, I think I understand perfectly," he smiled.<p>"So after I started third year at my new school I tried to fit in more I changed my image. I even joined the tennis club of all things," she said with a smile. "I wore the regular girls uniform like a good little girl, I even made some new friends."<p>"That's nice Kyoko" Ranma smiled as he tried out her new name.<p>"Yeah I had fun, got my mind off most of the problems in my life and even had some fun. Then one day we had a substitute teacher his name was Souichiro Otonashi.<p>"Wait a minute," Ranma said as he thought hard over that name before it hit him. "YOU MARRIED YOUR TEACHER!" Ranma exclaimed in shock.<p>"Um yeah but not right away it was after I graduated that we got married. And Souichiro was a perfect gentleman," Kyoko replied in indignation.<p>"I'm sorry it just kind of shocked me," Ranma said, even though he was still shocked by this turn of events, "I'm sure he was very nice."<p>"Yes he was, and the year we shared together was the best of my life" Kyoko said wistfully.<p>"Oh geeze," Ranma said giving her another hug, "I'm so sorry, I should have been there for you."<p>"No" Kyoko said as she looked into his eyes, "its okay."<p>"I'm sorry that happened to you. But at least you had a chance to have happy times with him . . . Not like me and Akane."<p>"Ran-Chan."<p>"No it's okay I'm sorry, I am over it but sometimes, you know?"<p>"Yeah I know," she said in sympathy.<p>***********************<p>What the Maison crew heard,<p>***********************<p>'YOU MARRIED YOUR TEACHER!' they heard yelled from inside.<p>"My guess is that yon Manager has informed Mr. Saotome of her husband's pre- marital status," Mr. Yotsuya whispered in his usual conniving tone.<p>"Gee ya think" Mrs. Ichinose muttered.<p>Then with a crash the group of eavesdroppers fell to the floor inside of the manager's room when she quickly opened the door.<p>Kyoko looked down on them while she tapped her toe and muttered, "And just what do you think you're doing!" Before she screamed out, "WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT EVESDROPPING!"<p>Godai and the coach jumped up and got in her face "Manager, are you all right?" "Mrs. Otonashi just how do you know this, man anyway?" her two suitors exclaimed in unison.<p>Ranma smirked and walked up to Kyoko where he put his hand on her shoulder in a very familiar way. "Oh I've known the manager here for a very long time."<p>"In fact" he paused "me and Kyo-Chan here we, well how to say this? I believe the term fiancée was used on several occasions."<p>"FIANCEE?"<p>"WHAT?"<p>"Oh my this is an interesting development."<p>"Ah crap not another one after the manager, she don't leave any of the good ones for us other girls."<p>Just guess who said these statements.<p>To Be Continued:<p>Endnotes:<p>Just to let you all know, yes I did not include how he got the cure in love lost. But come on I need some things for this fic, okay. As for unusual use of Kyoko / U-Chan's name in the first two chapters. When Ranma is thinking and speaking he uses U-Chan, everyone else uses Kyoko. Also give me your votes as to who should end up with whom? I have several ideas about how this could go but I really appreciate input. And more than once a detailed review has led to changes in a story of mine. I only wish I could write more, faster, for you guys. Also reviews can inspire me to write one story over another. One other thing I know that Maison Ikkoku is not in Tokyo in the cannon but in this AU it is.<p>Well what did you think? Please review.<p>New Endnotes:<p>Well that finishes the revision of the old chapters now to see if I can get a new one out soon. Thanks for everything guys I hope that you all like the changes I made in these chapters. Thanks for everything, Later.<p>Signed: Verse12
