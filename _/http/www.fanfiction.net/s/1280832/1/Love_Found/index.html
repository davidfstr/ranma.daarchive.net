</div>************************<p>Love Found?<p>By Verse12<p>************************<p>Disclaimer: I do not own these characters nor do I claim too, this is a simple fan based homage. Their creators and the companies they work for and with own the characters and all that pertains to them. (I.E. Rumiko Takahashi, Viz, Shougakukan) This is just fans of the show expressing their love for it for fun, no profit is involved or expected thank you.<p>Author's notes: Here we go the sequel to Love Lost, you will need to read the prequel fic Love Lost for this to make much sense, okay, thanks.<p>(Revised on Apr. 4, 2004. Updated the grammar and spelling, plus made some fixes on dialogue and text.)<p>***********************<p>Chapter One<p>Old Friend<p>***********************<p>Ranma ran through the rain he smiled as his feet pounded on the pavement and through the puddles that splashed around him. "I LOVE THE RAIN," he shouted out in glee into the night.<p>"WELL GOOD FOR YOU, I GOTTA GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING!" screamed a voice from a house he passed.<p>"SORRY" Ranma yelled back contritely, before his smile broke out again.<p>Ranma smiled as he ran on thinking how happy he was to finally be on track.  'I wasted so much time today when I got lost,' he snorted 'now I think I understand a little how Ryoga feels.'<p>He mumbled to himself, "But it should be just around the corner, can't believe it's almost 7:30 at night. I hope the manager is there; she wasn't when I called earlier. And I want to ask that Yotsuya guy about those bad directions he gave me."<p>He broke into a faster pace as he saw a building matching the description of Ikkoku-kan that he got when he had stopped for directions. Its fairly rundown appearance stood out starkly in the lamplight. He dashed down the road along a head high wall and came to a break in said wall that lead to a concrete pathway that was cut in a triangular pattern. He stopped his dash and looked up at the building it was a two story wooden structure with a large clock in the center of the roof built sometime before World War II. An awning covered the double doors that marked the entrance; bright light flooded out from opaque windows that were set in the doors.<p>"Well the grounds look taken care of, but the wood in the building looks old and patched, anyway its in my price range so lets check it out," he muttered.<p>Ranma walked toward the front entrance whistling to himself. When suddenly, "BARK, BARK" sounded from Ranma's left. He jumped into the air screaming "AARRRGGGHHH."<p>Ranma landed in a defensive crouch and looked around wildly before his eyes settled on a large and ugly white dog chained to a doghouse by the front door. "Man how did I miss you big fella?" Ranma questioned.<p>He walked over to the barking dog and held out his hand palm up "see big guy, I don't mean any harm I'm just looking for a room okay?" The big dog sniffed his hand then licked it before he jumped up onto Ranma's shoulders and licked his face. "Whoa, ha ha, stop it, big fella," Ranma said with a laugh as his face was licked all over.<p>The pig-tailed man stood up and smiled down at the dog "well I want to get out of this drizzle okay, not that I haven't spent more time than I care too think about out in the rain, see you later pooch." He walked up under the awning that covered the front door and shook off the rain.<p>He smiled too himself and knocked on the door and waited and waited and waited, but no answer. He tried the door and found it open he opened it a bit and peeked inside.<p>"Hello, Hello? Anyone here?" He heard voices laughing and joking from inside, Ranma stepped into the foyer. The wooden floors shone with polish, and a telephone stood to the left along with another hall that led away from it. Room number one stood across from the front door and what looks like the WC was on the opposite side of the foyer from phone. The sounds were coming from a staircase to the side of the WC; another hall ran down beside the staircase.<p>"HELLO" Ranma hollered out, trying to get someone's attention.<p>"Ah a guest this fair evening to whom do I have the pleasure of greeting this fine evening kind sir?" Asks a man in his mid to late thirties in a black suit and tie, the faint hint of alcohol lingered on his breath and a slight stager was evident in his walk as he came down the stairs.<p>Before Ranma could respond a female voice slurred from behind the man "soo wass sis gahin on." A red headed woman wearing a very sheer negligee peaked around from behind the man "Whoa, major beefcake" she said wide-eyed catching sight of Ranma. Ranma himself blushed and turned his gaze from the couple.<p>He stammered uncomfortably saying "I'm sorry I . . .the, I mean, that is to say, I called earlier about a room I'm sorry the door was open I'll just leave now bye." With this Ranma turned around to leave when the woman lunged forward and grabbed his arm, "no, no hansom you stay right hear we wer aven a parte so com on up ear with us an ave a liddle drinky poo okay."<p>It had been a long time since he had had to deal with an over amours female. Ranma was momentarily stunned into speechlessness as the woman began to drag him to the stairs so quickly he is barely able to get his shoes off. "Now wait a minute here I really don't drink and a . . . a party? I don't think that this is a good idea I had better leave."<p>"Now, now my boy don't be like that," the man said and grabbed Ranma's other arm and pulled him to the stairs. "It's just to be sociable, just a little gathering between us in this, our humble domicile, by the way I am mister Yotsuya."<p>"An I'm Akem . . ." hiccup "skuz me I'm Akemi Roppongi pleze to meet you hansom," says the woman as she cuddled up to Ranma. "An wash yur name?" she asked.<p>As they began to drag him up stairs Ranma stammered out his name in reply, now Ranma could have broken away but he was a little put off by the two. Plus he was trying to behave with better manners so in the end he let them drag him up the stairs. His first sight of second floor was of a long hallway that ran along the front of the building with a large sink in the middle underneath the window.<p>To the right several apartment doors lined the wall each with an opaque window set into it and a painted number on the glass. As the duo drug Ranma up to an open door where the laughing and carrying on was going on Yotsuya laughingly told Ranma that the manager was currently out but that they were expecting her back shortly.<p>"I'm sorry but I really should go." Ranma said as they neared the door he stopped making the other two jerk to a halt.<p>"No, no my good man you can get to know your new neighbors, so what do you do anyway, Hum?" asks Yotsuya.<p>"Well I am a martial artist but I plan on going to university soon, I was looking for a cheap place to live while I look for a job.<p>"Oh a martial artis," Akemi said gushingly as she rubbed up against Ranma, "an goin to college." Very uncomfortable Ranma blushed "I really wish you wouldn't do that ma'am."<p>Before Akemi could respond a short, overweight, middle-aged woman leaned out the door of room five, "hey you guys what's taken so long are we have'n a party or what, WHOA and who's this, you're a good looking one" exclaimed the woman.<p>"Mrs. Ichinose, this is our new neighbor one Ranma Saotome, Ranma this is Mrs. Ichinosei she and her family live in room number one downstairs."<p>"Um . . . pleased to meet you," Ranma stammered out.<p>"You too, well come on in and join the party," she stated before she turned around and reentered the room.<p>In an almost bewildered state Ranma let himself be dragged into a room. The small one room apartment had a closet to one side and a small kitchenette by the door; a younger man sat at a desk his back to the door. "WOULD YOU GUYS PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE, I HAVE TO STUDY FOR AN EXAM TOMMOROW!" he yelled out.<p>"Now, now young Godai is that anyway to speak when we have guest, in fact he is to be our new neighbor," Yotsuya said.<p>"Yah Godai don be so rude," Akemi, slurred, who finally let go of Ranma as she wandered over to a mug of beer.<p>"Now wait a second, I haven't said yes to anything yet, in fact the more I see of this place the more I don't think it is the right place for me," Ranma stated emphatically.<p>"Oh and what's wrong with this place hum?" Mrs. Ichinose asked as she walked up to Ranma belligerently. "You to good for a place like this is it?"<p>"No that's not that it all," Ranma stammered out kind of embarrassed at his own outburst. "I just need a more stable environment to study and . . ."<p>"You and me both" the twenty something young man at the desk muttered, effectively cutting off whatever Ranma was going to say next.<p>"Anyway all my reasons are my own, I didn't mean any offense. I think I will be going now, I am sorry to have disturbed you I'll see my self-out, thank you," With this Ranma bowed and left the room.<p>"Aw honey don go," Akemi said and staggered over to the door following after Ranma. Yotsuya and eventually the others followed her as well. "Yes Ranma my dear boy stay, the manager should be home any minute and she was rather excited by the chance of renting out one of the other rooms."<p>"No that's okay I'll just be going," Ranma said and walked down the stairs.  He strode over to the foyer and sat down to put on his shoes. After he did that he stood up and smiled as he turned to face the gathered group behind him "well it's been nice."<p>With that he grasped the handle of the door and began to open it when he heard some voices on the other side, in the background he heard Yotsuya mention something about the manager being back from her date with "The Coach?" But Ranma's confusion isn't over this it's over the voice of the woman; it sounded very familiar to him.<p>When he felt a tug on the door from the other side he let go, only to gasp in shock at the sight before him. For there before him stood none other than his old childhood friend.<p>*********************<p>The gathered residents of Maison Ikkoku plus Coach Mitaka (who was hiding on the far side of the patio as far away from the dog Souichiro as possible.) react in different ways to the utterances issued by the new guy and Manager Otanashi, for what they said in shocked tones and gazes to each other was.<p>"Ran-Chan"<p>"U-Chan"<p>To be continued:<p>*********************<p>End notes: well let me know what you think please. Oh and for those of you who do not know what a WC is, it stands for water closet, a toilet. Any way please Review thank you.<p>New end notes: I was going to work on the next chapter but it had been so long I went back to reread the old chapters and I couldn't get through them. So I decided to do a little revision on these old chapters before going onto the next new chapter.<p>Signed: Verse12
