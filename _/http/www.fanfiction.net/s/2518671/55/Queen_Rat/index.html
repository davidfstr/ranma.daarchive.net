</div><p>Chapter 6</p><p>''s Girl'</p><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight, I'm your host, Satchi Kato." The pretty reporter said to the camera. An image of a woman in black and wearing a veil appeared behind her. "We have an update for all you Kodachi Kuno fans." She said. The images behind her showed the veiled woman on the street, attending a show. Always in the company of her constant companion Noriko Mata. "In recent weeks, Ms. Kuno has been seen more and more frequently in public, though she continues to maintain a low profile."</p><p>The Reporter turned to another camera. "Tonight's topic, Kodachi Kuno, is her mourning finally over?" She asked. "When we come back."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Kodachi paced back and forth nervously. Noriko watched her friend and companion with some amusement. "Relax Dachi." Noriko said. She looked at her watch. "The competition doesn't start for another, hmm, fifteen minutes."</p><p>"I know. I know." Kodachi said. "I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm never nervous before a competition."</p><p>"Well that's probably because you're usually the one competing." Noriko said. "Not waiting for your protege to perform." She walked over and put her hand on Kodachi's shoulder comfortingly. "She'll do fine." The door to the locker room opened. "Heads up, here she comes." Out of the locker room skipped Kiko Kobiashi. The seven year old was wearing black tights with a red rose applique along the front. "The Red Rose." Noriko announced in amusement.</p><p>"Auntie Dachi." Kiko said excitedly. "You came." She jumped into Kodachi's arms. "Mommy wasn't sure you'd make it."</p><p>"And miss your first competition? Never." Kodachi replied fiercely. "Now go stretch." Kodachi ordered.</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Kiko replied. Kodachi put Kiko down and walked over to the bleachers. Koko Kobiashi was sitting on one of the lower seats. She was biting her fingernails nervously. "Ms. Kuno." Koko jumped up and bowed. "Thank you so much for coming." Kodachi waved her back to her seat and sat down next to her. Noriko sat on Kodachi's other side.</p><p>"Did you really think I'd miss her first tournament?" Kodachi shook her head. Kodachi sighed nostalgically. "I remember my first tournament." She said. Kodachi leaned over. "I did terribly.' She confided. Kodachi clapped her hands. "Oh, it's starting." She said excitedly.</p><p>The first event was the balance beam and Kiko was the fourth competitor. Kodachi looked over to Kiko. The little girl was stretching in the corner but Kodachi could see her watching each girl closely as they did their routines. To Kodachi's satisfaction the little girl continued her stretches and even did some breathing exercises to calm herself. Finally it was Kiko's turn.</p><p>Kiko looked over to her mother and Kodachi. The two women smiled encouragingly. Kiko's face firmed in determination. 'For mommy and Auntie Dachi.' She told herself. Kiko approached the balance beam. She took a deep breath before she hopped up on the bar. Kiko steadied herself before she began her routine. It was a simple routine as would be expected for her age, but Kiko demonstrated a maturity that spoke of hours of practice under a knowledgeable coach. Both Koko and Kodachi were sitting on the edge of their seats and barely breathed. They held their breath as Kiko completed the last compulsory move before Kiko got ready for her dismount.</p><p>"Come on, baby." Kodachi murmurred. "Just like you practiced." Kiko flipped off the bar and landed on her feet. Her arms shot into the air just as she was taught. Kodachi jumped to her feet almost the moment Kiko's feet hit the ground. "Yes!" Exclaimed Kodachi. Her applause was joined by the audience.</p><p>Kiko bowed to the judges, the audience and then turned to where Koko and Kodachi were standing and bowed to them as well. A huge and proud smile was on the little girl's face. There were matching smiles on both Koko and Kodachi's face. Kiko walked over to the bench with the rest of the young competitors and waited for her next event. Kiko would glance over to her mother and Kodachi from time to time but for the most part watched the other competitors.</p><p>After the balance beam, Kiko competed on the unevern parrallel bars and finally the floor exercise. To Kodachi's critical eye, the little girl was too nervous to relax between events and by the time she did the floor exercise, Kiko was obviously getting tired. Kiko bobbled a back flip and stepped out on her landing but she completed the routine. Still, Kiko did well enough to finish third overall.</p><p>It was a very subdued Kiko that approached her mother and Kodachi after she changed. She walked over to Kodachi with her eyes downcast. "I'm so sorry, Auntie Dachi." Kiko said sadly.</p><p>"Sorry?" Kodachi asked in surprise. "Whatever for?" She said. "You did wonderfully for your first competition."</p><p>"But I didn't win." Kiko exclaimed and tears began to run down her face.</p><p>Kodachi immediately knelt down and gathered the little girl in her arms. "You have nothing to apologize for, baby. Nothing." Kodachi said comfortingly.</p><p>"But, I wanted to win." Kiko sobbed. "I-I wanted you to be proud of me."</p><p>"Oh, baby. I was never so proud of anyone in my entire life." Kodachi said fiercely. "I could never be prouder than I am right now. Never." She stood with Kiko in her arms. "oomph, you're getting to heavy for me to pick up." Kodachi mock complained. "Now, no more apologies." She said. "We are going out and celebrating." She put Kiko down on her feet and took the little girl's hand.</p><p>After a short trip in the limousine the three women and one little girl were enjoying a treat in a local ice cream parlor. The child's natural resiliance came to the fore and Kiko smiled more naturally. Kodachi reached into her purse and took out two wrapped packages. "I was going to wait for your birthday." Kodachi said. "But since you did so well." She placed one of the packages in front of Kiko. The other she placed in front of Koko. "And I do hope you'll forgive me for not giving you this sooner." She said.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno?" Koko looked at the wrapped package and slowly opened it. Inside was a velvet box. Koko opened the box to reveal a gold spider pendant with ruby eyes. "Oh, Ms. Kuno, I don't deserve this." She protested. "This is for your special girls." Her hand went to her scarred cheek. "I don't..." Koko broke off. "Not since..."</p><p>"If you don't then no one does." Noriko commented. "You've been a tremendous help at the club." Noriko smiled. "And no one does hair and makeup like you do." Noriko said. "There are many ways of being one of Ms. Kuno's special girls."</p><p>"Indeed." Kodachi agreed.</p><p>There was the sound of tearing paper as Kiko attacked her gift. "Oh mommy, mommy, look." She held up a pendant. "I got one too."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema's eyes opened. Three weeks had passed since Ranma had rescued her and she had recovered from her ordeal. Pema looked around. Something had woken her. She strained her ears and heard the sound of moans. Pema slipped quietly out of the, to her, too comfortable bed and padded to the door of the bedroom. She placed her ear against the door. Pema slowly opened the door. The moans were a little louder and seemed to be coming from the gods' bedroom. Pema tiptoed to the closed door and eased it open. She stuck her head inside. Pema's eyes widened. "No!" She yelled. "Ranma not for you. Ranma for Akane and Ukyo."</p><p>Pema launched herself at the two men who were, from Pema's point of view, violating the red haired goddess that was Ranma's other form. She attempted to pull one of the men, a monster of a man with black hair, off of Ranma. "Ranma not for you." Pema repeated over and over as she beat on the man's back with her fists. The other man, brown haired and slim, started laughing. "No laugh." She spat angrily. "No laugh."</p><p>"Pema, stop." Laughed the black haired man. "It's me, Akane." He said in Cantonese. The man pointed to the laughing brown haired man. "That's Ukyo."</p><p>Pema stopped hitting the black haired man. She looked at the redhead. Ranma nodded. Pema jumped away and prostrated herself on the ground. "Forgive Pema." She said in a trembling voice. "Forgive Pema." She closed her eyes, expecting the worst.</p><p>"Ranma for Akane and Ukyo, huh Sugar?" The voice of one of the men. Pema trembled even more when she found that she recognized the voice as being Ukyo's. Pema moaned in fear. Pema heard the two men sigh. "just as it was getting good too.' Muttered the other man in a deep baritone. "Well, at least we know she doesn't want Ranma for herself." The man said.</p><p>Pema looked up with an incredulous look on her face. "Want Ranma?" Pema looked down hurriedly. "Ranma god." Pema said to the ground. "Only Akane and Ukyo worthy."</p><p>"You know, that's the most words out of her at one time." Ranma commented in her contralto voice. "Pema right." Ranma said in Cantonese. "Only Akane and Ukyo worthy." Ranma said. "And Pema, good friend."</p><p>"Ranma not angry?" Pema looked up.</p><p>"Ranma not angry." Ranma said. "Now go back to bed." Ranma said gently.</p><p>Pema nodded and walked out of the room. Ranma, Akane and Ukyo looked at each other and began to giggle. "Okay, where were we?" Akane asked. "Before Pema decided to protect your honor, that is."</p><p>The next morning Pema woke early and began to make breakfast. "Oh please don't send me away." She repeated to herself over and over. She looked up in fright as the door opened and Akane, back in female form, staggered into the kitchen. "Please tell me you made tea." Akane half groaned.</p><p>Pema hurried over with a tea pot. "Pema make tea." She poured a trembling cup and placed it in front of Akane. Akane lifted the cup and inhaled the aroma before taking a sip. "Ahh." Akane said in appreciation. She looked at Pema over the rim of the cup. "Don't worry, we're not mad." Akane smiled. "Do you really think Ranma could be..." Akane paused in mid sentence. "Oh." Akane shook her head. "Not Ranma." She said.</p><p>Pema looked thoughtful for a moment then she nodded. "Ranma powerful god."</p><p>"Not a god, Pema." Akane said. "God killer." Pema's eyes widened. Akane nodded. "Ever hear of Saffron?" Pema shook her head. "Some thought he was a god. For good reason."</p><p>"Ranma kill?" Pema asked in shock.</p><p>"Ranma kill." Akane nodded. "To save me."</p><p>"Ahh." Breathed Pema. "Ranma love you lots." She looked at the door. "Ranma save Ukyo too?"</p><p>Akane chuckled. "No." She said. "Ukyo save us." The door opened and Ranma and Ukyo stumbled into the kitchen. Pema put cups of tea in front of both of them. Akane waited until both Ranma and Ukyo had a couple sips. "I was thinking we'd let Pema stay." Akane said. She looked at Ukyo. "We may not be the best role models but I think it's safer here than with Daddy."</p><p>"Pops?" Ranma said sourly.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane agreed. "Besides, I think we know we can trust her."</p><p>"I got no problem with it." Ranma said. Ukyo nodded in agreement. "Pema?" Ranma got the Tibetan girl's attention. "Last night. It what we do." He said in Cantonese. "Understand?"</p><p>Pema nodded rapidly. "Pema understand. No worry." She promised. Pema waved a hand. "Pema clean, make food." She said eagerly. "Pema clean good. Cook good." Pema almost danced in place.</p><p>"Pema go school. Learn Japanese." Ranma said firmly. Pema nodded eagerly. "Good." Ranma looked at Akane and Ukyo for a moment. He returned his attention to Pema. "Pema meet someone, answer all questions. Tell truth." He said.</p><p>"Pema tell truth." Pema replied wide eyed.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight. I'm your host, Saatchi Kato." The pretty reported smiled as an image appeared on the screen behind here. "Nabiki Tendo, rich, intelligent, beautiful and engaged to the most eligible bachelor in all Japan, Tatewaki Kuno." There was a momentary look of jealousy on the reporters face.</p><p>The reporter swiveled her chair to face another camera. Images appeared behind her as she spoke. "Born the middle daughter to a poor but proud martial artist, she lost her mother when she was eight, Nabiki Tendo defied the odds to become one of the most powerful women, one of the most powerful people, in all of Japan. What drives her? What is the secret of her success? Are the rumors about her true?" The reporters voice hushed slightly. "Tonight's topic; Nabiki Tendo, the Ice Queen." She said. "But first, these messages."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"So." Nabiki said. "This is Pema."</p><p>"This is Pema." Ranma said somberly. "Pema. This Ice Queen." He said. "She leader."</p><p>"Oh this take too long." Ting Li said. She started rattling in a dialect. Pema replied quickly. Ting Li pointed to different people, starting with Nabiki and spoke. Pema's eyes widened and she looked at Nabiki with an expression that combined shock and fear. Ting Li pointed to the rest of the people in the room. Ryoga. Konatsu, Kimi Ota, Kodachi Kuno, Noriko Mata, Tatewaki Kuno and finally a gruff and craggy man. "Chikato Noriudo." Ting Li introduced the man. She said something else and Pema suddenly ducked behind Ranma.</p><p>"What did you tell her?" Ranma said in concern.</p><p>"That he cop." Ting Li replied. Ting Li rattled off some more of Pema's dialect. Pema peeked out from behind Ranma. "I just tell her, Chikato not arrest. Not deport."</p><p>Chikato Noriudo looked at Pema for a moment then nodded. "Tell her I promise." He told Ting Li. Chikato leaned back in his chair. "I will not have slave runners in Japan." The police captain rumbled menacingly. "Lord Kuno have you found the pirate's base?" He asked.</p><p>"Aye." Tatewaki rumbled. "They have ten attack craft."</p><p>"Ten?" Chikato exclaimed. "That's a fucking navy."</p><p>"Aye." Tatewaki agreed moodily. "Too many for my people to attack all at once." He smiled grimly. "I think we needs emulate the pirates somewhat."</p><p>"Do what you have to, Lord Kuno." Chikato said. "I'll cover for you." He and Tatewaki exchanged respectful nods. Chikato looked at Nabiki. "But I want the pirate leader alive." He said.</p><p>"Lover will do his best." Nabiki promised. Nabiki reached out a hand and Kimi placed a folder into it. "Ting Li tell Pema I want her to look at these pictures. I want to know if she recognizes any of them and from where." She placed the folder on the desk opened it and turned it around and pushed it in front of Pema while Ting Li spoke.</p><p>Pema nodded and started looking through the pictures. Nabiki could see the young girl concentrating on each picture. She hissed at one picture and tapped it. "Know him." She said in accented Japanese. "Take me from village."</p><p>"Dou Gan Shou." Nabiki replied in icy tones. She waved a finger. "Tell her to keep looking."</p><p>Pema resumed looking through the pictures, finally she shook her head as she reached the last one. "Not know." She said. She placed her hands over her eyes. "Not see." She looked up as TIng Li spoke. She nodded and replied.</p><p>"Blind folded." Ting Li explained. Pema added something. "She hear voice. Man, speak Japanese." Pema shuddered and kept talking. "She say she never forget voice." Ting Li translated. "Ugly voice."</p><p>"Ugly?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>Pema nodded. "Say lot bad word." She said through Ting Li. Pema looked down in embarrassment. "Sound like bad word." She corrected herself. "Feel hand." She placed a hand on her breast. "Here." Her hand made a vague motion downward. "There." She said in shame filled tones. "Feel like, like..." She looked at Ting Li and said something.</p><p>"Slimy." Ting Li interpreted.</p><p>"Wasuhara." Nabiki growled.</p><p>"All we have is one little girl's say so." Kimi cautioned. "Not that I don't believe her, but it's not enough."</p><p>"Agreed." Nabki said reluctantly. "Kyoshi will need convincing evidence to turn on Tokio." She looked at Ranma. "Did you go back to the warehouse?" She asked.</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Empty." He replied. "They even vacuumed."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "No one said Wasuhara was stupid." She said coldly. "Keep looking." She said. Nabiki looked at Kodachi. "Have your girls heard anything?"</p><p>Kodachi shook her head. "Not at the moment." Kodachi tapped her lips with a manicured finger. "If there is anything to be learned, Ami will learn it." She said. "But I will alert her to our suspicions." She paused as Noriko leaned over and whispered something into Kodachi's ear. "Really?" Noriko smiled and nodded. Kodachi turned to Nabiki. "It seems one of Tokio's men is a regular at the club." She shrugged. "Whether as spy or something else, he represents an opportunity."</p><p>"Good." Nabiki said in satisfaction. "I think that's all we can do now." She said. Nabiki looked at Pema. "Thank you." She said to the young girl. Pema bobbed her head nervously. Nabiki looked at Akane. "I'll arrange for an allowance for her." She said. "If anyone asks, she's an exchange student from Tibet."</p><p>"That'll work." Akane said. "Mostly true too."</p><p>End Chapter 6</p><p>End Part 1</p><p>Author's Notes: Well, part one is done. Part two will begin in a week or two. I'm still putting the finishing touches on part three. I've been reading the reviews and, as usual, my readers have provided not only excellent critiques but even more interesting and excellent suggestions.</p><p>I have to make a comment that has nothing to do with Queen Rat. It's about the Olympics. . Both the opening and closing ceremonies, in my opinion, set the bar so high that I almost pity the UK. That is going to be one tough act to follow.</p>
