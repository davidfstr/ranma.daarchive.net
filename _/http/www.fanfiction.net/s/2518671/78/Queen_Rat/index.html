</div><p>Chapter 4</p><p>'Bargains'</p><p>Lady Nabiki Kuno sat at her antique desk and studied some notes. Since their marriage, Nabiki and Tatewaki, along with Kimi Ota, had taken up residence in the mansion. Though they maintained a separate wing from Kodachi and Noriko. The mansion was large enough, and so well equipped, that they could go days without running into each other. In the past two years, Nabiki had consolidated her grip on Nerima and had great influence in the surrounding four wards of Suganama, Nakano, Itabashi, and Toshima. Her influence in the next closest wards of Shinjiku and Kita was not as strong but strong enough to be left alone by all but the largest Yakusa families. So far, those families had found it both expedient as well as cautious to not interfere and had left her alone.'Of course having the muscle to back it up doesn't hurt.' Nabiki mused.</p><p>What Nabiki had done with some official complicity though not official sanction was to turn the black market, at least in her areas of control, into a gray market. As long as Nabiki kept the peace and generated income that the government could tax without disrupting the legitimate economy, they left her alone. For the last two years, Nabiki had done just that. Through a complex chain of both dummy and legitimate companies, Nabiki funneled contraband into her territory and out through legitimate businesses. Businesses that she had financed either directly or indirectly. Businesses that hired people. People that paid taxes. As her wealth and power grew she converted more and more of her holdings into mostly legitimate ones. The operative word being 'mostly'. But, again, as long as Nabiki kept to her part of the bargain, the government left her alone.</p><p>Lying on her stomach on a settee nearby, Lady Kimi of the Kuno looked down at her laptap on a stand next to the settee and idly clicked a key every so often. As she studied her screen an instant message chat request box appeared on the corner. 'Cook.' She thought on recognizing the screen name. She reluctantly pressed the chat accept key. "?" She typed.</p><p>"You must speak to her." Cook wrote back. "It's been two years."</p><p>"I can't." Kimi typed back. She looked over to Nabiki. The dark haried women with the helmet cut hair style was engrossed in her notes. She looked back at the keyboard.</p><p>"You must." Cook had typed back. "We beg you."</p><p>Kimi sighed and broke the connection. "Lover boy will be back in a couple days." Kimi said conversationally.</p><p>Nabiki put down her pen and leaned back in her chair. A wry smile appeared on her face. "I was trying very hard not to think about that." She crossed her arms across her chest. "What's up?" She asked.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Kimi replied.</p><p>"Don't give me that." Nabiki returned. "I know you too well, Kimi Kuno." She said. "You have something on your mind."</p><p>Kimi sighed. "Not my mind." She disagreed. "Other peoples' minds." Kimi sat up."I need a drink." She said. "Join me?" She asked.</p><p>"Will I need one?" Nabiki asked sourly. Kimi nodded. "A short one."</p><p>Kimi walked over to the bar and quickly made a couple drinks. Bourbon on ice. Nabiki's favorite drink. She walked over to Nabiki and handed her the drink, then rested her hip on the desk. "I've been putting offf talking about this for a while." She said. "There's a downside to..." She waved an all encompassing hand. "All this." Kimi took a good swallow of her drink and stirred the ice with her finger.</p><p>"A downside?" Prompted Nabiki when Kimi's silence continued. She sipped her drink.</p><p>"For the past few weeks..." Kimi took another swallow of her drink. "For the past few weeks I've been...approached." She rolled her eyes. "Ambushed more like." She said in exasperation. "I can't walk down a hallway without one of the Kuno stopping me." Kimi drained her drink and walked back to the bar. "All this comes at a price, Nabs." She said as she made another drink. "And they want you to start paying them back."</p><p>"Paying who back." Nabiki asked. "The Kuno?" She hazarded. "I don't under..." Nabiki trailed off. "No." She said. "Oh no." She said angrily. "I am not a brood mare."</p><p>"I hate to tell you this, Nabs old girl." Kimi replied. "But yes you are." Kimi swallowed another hefty slug of her drink. "So am I."</p><p>Nabiki looked at Kimi in surprise. "Excuse me?" She asked.</p><p>"I'm the official concubine, Nabs." Kimi replied. "Right?"</p><p>"That's a sham and you know it." Nabiki replied.</p><p>"Is it?' Kimi interrupted with a sour laugh. "If it is, someone forgot to tell the Kuno." She shook her head. "You're expected to produce an heir, Nabs." She said. "And I'm expected to produce...a backup." She said. "That's what he said anyway."</p><p>Nabiki prided herself on her ability to maintain her composure under the most extreme pressures and, for a moment, she succeeded. But only for a moment. "He?" She asked. "Oh...crap." She sputtered. "It's Cook isn't it?' She growled. "Who the hell does he think he is?' She stood up. "I am going to give that...that overfed...over...grrrr."</p><p>"Nabs, stop." Kimi said in annoyance. Kimi looked at her drink. "He's...he's right." She looked at Nabiki. "He's right and you know it." She said. "It's your fault you know." She said with a touch of humor in her voice. "You were the one who wanted to marry Tatewaki." She said. "You're the one who wanted to be Lady Kuno." She looked down at her glass. "And don't pretend you didn't expect this." Kimi said. "You've used tradition and custom often enough to get your way." She said. "And to manipulate others."</p><p>Nabiki looked at Kimi and then sat down somewhat heavily in her chair. "Damn." She said in a near whisper. "I hate it when you're right." She grumped.</p><p>"You just hate being out-manuevered." Kimi disagreed. She nodded. "Me too." She said. "I really don't see a way out of this Nabs." She said moodily. "We're going to have to give them what they want."</p><p>"We?" Nabiki asked in surprise. "Don't you mean me?' She said.</p><p>Kimi gave Nabiki a helpless smile. "Hey, you don't expect me to let you suffer alone, do you?" She said. "I have a great idea." She said brightly. She raised the bottle of bourbon. "Let's get really drunk."</p><p>Nabiki snorted. "That's what I like about you Kimi." Nabiki said. "You always have such good ideas." She extended her glass. "I'll have a double."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Genji Morimoto sat in an easy chair in front of a fire. He was wearing a heavy brocaded robe and smoking a cigar. A snifter of brandy held in his other hand. Though in his fifties he had the drive and ambition of a man half his age. He was fit though slightly heavyset. He looked like what he was, a successful and influential businessman who was no stranger to the...rougher side of business. Now even more so since he joined forces with the Ice Queen.</p><p>Genji inherited a business that was no stranger to smuggling. There were many times in his rise to the top that he made some good and quick money moving questionable merchandise. To be fair and to his credit, he never transported drugs, or women, but there were times he didn't ask a lot of questions. And there were times where only his wits and his fists were all that stood between Genji and, in at least one time in his life, death. Genji looked at the end of his cigar and smiled in satisfaction. "Kinnikun gets some damn good cigars." He said. Genji looked up as the door to his study opened and a tall, shapely and extremely attractive woman stepped into the room.</p><p>"We're home." She said. She walked over to Genji and sat in his lap. She took the cigar from Genji and took a puff. Then she licked the end of the cigar and put it in Genji's mouth.</p><p>Genji laughed around the cigar. "Welcome home, my pretty Makoto." He placed the cigar in an ashtray and his now free hand started stroking the tall brunettes shapely stockinged legs. "Did you and Yuki have fun shopping?" He asked.</p><p>Makoto giggled and nodded. "Wait until you see what I got for me and Yuki to wear to the party." She said in teasing tones. Makoto took the brandy snifter from Genji and took a sip. She licked her full lips. "Yum."</p><p>Genji smiled and ran his hand under Makotoa tight skirt and caressed her tight rear. "Yum." He said. Makoto giggled and rolled slightly to give Genji better access. Which Genji took advantage of. "I hope you didn't spend all my money." Genji said in false dire tones.</p><p>"But Genji, what's the good of having money if you can't spend it?" Makoto replied in reasonable tones. She spread her legs to allow Genji to caress the insides of her thighs. "Aren't I worth it?" She said in a pout.</p><p>Genji chuckled as he caressed Makoto. "That you are, my pretty Makoto, that you are." He said fondly. "You're worth every penny you spend and more." Makoto smiled happily and lay against Genji's chest as Genji continued his caresses. "I don't see Yuki." He said. "Was she bad?" He asked with a smile.</p><p>"Oh very bad, Genji." Makoto giggled. "I had to tie her to the bed again."</p><p>It was a game the three of them played frequently. Yuki would do something 'bad' and Makoto would then demand that Genji 'punish' Yuki. Bad had a very flexible meaning to Makoto. Yuki could be bad for any number of offenses, such as smiling at someone on the street or wearing the wrong underwear. Makoto enjoyed dominating Yuki and Yuki, for her part, found that she enjoyed being dominated. She'd sometimes even go out of her way to do something 'bad'. And if 'bad' had a very flexible meaning so too did 'punish'.</p><p>Neither Makoto or Genji would do anything that would cause the Kuno retainer any pain, but that didn't stop them from putting Yuki into uncomfortable or embarrassing situtations. It was the price Yuki gladly paid for having sex with both Makoto and Genji. Especially Makoto and Genji. It wasn't that Genji was a superb lover, he was, or that he was well endowed, he was no Ranma but then again, who was, it was more that Genji, aided and abetted by Makoto, was extraordinarily creative when it came to sex and Makoto was happily willing to act out any of Genji's more creative suggestions.</p><p>"Oh, then I suppose I should go and punish her." Genji said amiably. Makoto clapped her hands gleefully. "That's what I love about you, Makoto." Genji said. "You always try to keep me happy."</p><p>"That's because I love you, Genji." Makoto said. She hopped off Genji's lap. "Now,let's go punish Yuki." She said in anticipation. She looped her arm through Genji's and they exited Genji's study. "And then we can all go out for dinner."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A limosine carrying Tatewaki, Lord Kuno, drove up the long curving driveway that fronted the Kuno mansion. He was returning after a long absence having spent the last two months with Captain Osigi hunting for pirates. While it was true that many pirates were smugglers and Tatewaki himself protected the contraband shipments of Kinnikun Honda, Tatewaki did not consider them the same thing. Kinnikun Honda for all his being Yakusa was, in Tatewaki's opinion, a gentlemen. More so when Oyabun Honda had taken Kodachi's severing of their relationship with good grace.</p><p>Tatewaki exited the limosine. It seemed that nearly every retainer he had was lined up in front of the mansion and up the stairs to the mansions entrance. In the past, Tatewaki, would demand such a display of fealty regardless of the length of his absence or its' reason. Being the loyal retainers that they were, they did as requested but there was always something lacking and perfunctary in their attitude. Oh they would be polite and respectful but there was...' There was no heart.' Tatewaki thought. Standing at the foot of the stairs was, in Tatewaki's opinion, the heart that was missing, "My Lady." Tatewaki greeted his wife Nabiki, the Lady Kuno.</p><p>Nabiki bowed. "My Lord." She said in reply. Nabiki stepped closer and was immediately wrapped in Tatewaki's arms for a kiss in greeting. An audible sigh wafted from the lines of attending retainers. "It's good to have you home. You were gone too long." Nabiki said in a voice thick with emotion when the kiss finally ended. "Will you not greet your Lady Kimi?" She asked indicating the blond woman standing just off to the side. "She too has greatly missed her lord and protector." Nabiki said in a formal voice pitched to carry.</p><p>Tatewaki raised an eyebrow but knowing Nabiki did little without great thought approached Kimi and gave her, while not as demonstrative as the kiss he gave Nabiki, a kiss that was more affectionate then due a mere friend. Again another whispering sigh wafted from the retainers. To Tatewaki's ears the sigh seemed surprisingly approving.</p><p>Tatewaki turned and raised his hand. Nabiki placed her hand on top of Tatewaki's and the two ascended the stairs to the mansion. Kimi walked along on Tatewaki's left but did not attempt to touch him. 'Methinks there is much afoot that I have missed out on.' Tatewaki mused. As they ascended the long stairway to the entrance of the Kuno mansion, the Kuno retainers bowed and fell in behind them as they passed. That was not unusual and Tatewaki barely took notice.</p><p>"Did you have a successful hunt, My Lord?" Nabiki asked in conversational tones that was nonetheless heard by the quietly following retainers.</p><p>"Passable, My Ladies." Tatewaki replied including Kimi in his reply."Barely passable." He added. "We may have to either broaden our patrols or move to an entirely new area all together." Tatewaki laughed. "Our good Captain is quite diligent in carrying out his duties." He said. "I fear he's chased them all away." He said mournfully.</p><p>Nabiki laughed. Her laughter was echoed by Kimi of course but there was an approving susseration from the following retainers. "I believe the Kuno are pleased by your news, My Lord." She said. "We should let our Captain do what he deems best." Nabiki said. "I assume he wishes to move his fleet?"</p><p>"Yes, My Lady." Tatewaki replied. He was pleased by the murmur of approval and respect that came from Nabiki's words. "He has not made a suggestion as to where but I believe he is considering Hokkaido."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "He'd be a fool not too and our Captain is anything but a fool." she replied. "He's there often enough as it is." She pointed out. "Now enough of our good Captain. Cook has been working overtime in the kitchen and dinner promises to rival one of Kasumi's greater efforts."</p><p>"That's no lie." Kimi added with a rueful chuckle. "There goes my diet." She bemoaned as she patted her trim mid section. "Good thing Nabs makes me do those katas every day."</p><p>"One thing My Lord, your sister has informed me that while she would love to join us she has some unexpected guests." Nabiki said. "It seems that your Sister's Koko has a boyfriend."</p><p>"Indeed?" Tatewaki replied in interested tones. "And what does Miss Kiko think of all of this?" He asked. There was a muted chuckle from the following retainers. They reached a set of doors and two retainers ran ahead to open them for Tatewaki and his party.</p><p>"I hear she approves." Nabiki replied. "Of the idea anyway." She added. "This is the first time they've met."</p><p>"Indeed?" Tatewaki replied. "I must meet this man as well." Tatewaki said decisively. He half turned. "Please extend an invititation to my Sister and her guests." He said to a retainer standing just behind him.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hiroichii Kiyuo was, in his own words, not much to look at. He was slightly below average height, slim to the point of being skinny and it made his head seem too large. The dinners that Koko had cooked forshadowed an ending to that state. He had a bald spot that he had unsuccessfully tried to comb over. That was until Koko put a stop to it. Most people thought he was entirely too self-critical. He'd never be called handsome but most women thought he was cute in his own way but he was painfully uncomfortable around women. His inexperience with women was something Koko found a little frustrating but what he lacked in skill and endurance he made up for in enthusiasm. Kiko suppressed a giggle at the thought.</p><p>On the plus side he was intelligent, gentle and kind. He was also already deeply in love with Koko. Something Koko found she was unaccustomed to and overwhelmed by at times.</p><p>Koko and Hiro sat side by side on a couch as they both nervously watched the person pacing back and forth in front of them. The person finally stopped in front of Hiro and leaned closer. "Well, you're cute enough I guess." Kiko said doubtfully.</p><p>"Kiko." Koko admonished. "Be good."</p><p>"I doubt she was ever...good." Kodachi said from where she was leaning against a wall.</p><p>"Auntie." Complained Kiko. She twisted her mouth. "Okay, I guess I deserved that." She said in admission. She looked at her mother. "Do you really like him, Mom?"</p><p>"I really like him, honey." Koko affirmed.</p><p>"Well okay then." Kiko said. She leaned closer to Hiro until their noses almost touched. "But you better be nice to my Mom."</p><p>"I don't dare be anything but nice." Hiro chuckled self-consciously. "I'm...I think Koko, I mean your mother, is stronger than me."</p><p>Kiko giggled. "Probably." She agreed. Kiko leaned back. "So what do I call you?" She asked. "Uncle Hiro? Mr. Kiyuo?" She asked. "I'm not calling you Dad." She said. "Not unless you marry Mom." Kiko giggled at the hopeful look on Hiro's face. "I think I'll call you Uncle Hiro." She said. "And you may call me Kiko."</p><p>"I'd like that, Kiko." Hiro said in relief.</p><p>Kodachi smiled proudly at Kiko. 'She sounded just like a Kuno.' She thought. Kodachi turned her head as Noriko escorted one of the many Kuno retainers into the room. She raised an eyebrow upon recognizing the man as one of her brother's personal retainers.</p><p>"Excuse me for intruding, My lady." The retianer said. "But Lord Kuno wondered if you and your guests would care to join him and his Ladies for dinner?" The retainer smiled. "Lord Kuno was most interested in meeting the man who's captured Koko's heart." The retainer made a slight head movement toward Kiko. "You can understand his interest."</p><p>"My brother is too kind." Kodachi replied. "I had not wanted to impose." She said. "Excuse me for a moment." Kodachi turned. "It appears my brother has invited us to dinner." She announced though she looked directly at Koko and Hiro. "What should I tell him?"</p><p>"Dinner?" Squeaked Hiro. "With Lord Kuno?" He swallowed nervously. "I-I'm not dressed properly." He said in some alarm.</p><p>Kodachi smiled. "Easily remedied." She said. "Koko, I believe there may be something suitable for Mr. Kiyuo to wear, oh, in the red suite." She smiled at the look of excitement on Koko's face. "You might avail yourself of something more...fashionable as well." She waved Koko away. Kodachi covered her mouth to hide the smile that appeared as Koko all but dragged Hiro away. Kodachi turned to the retainer. "Please inform my brother that my guests and I are honored by his invitation and that we we be there once we are suitably attired." Kodachi smiled. "I suspect my brother is somewhat impatient to spend some time with his Ladies."</p><p>The retainer smiled briefly. He bowed slightly. "If I may venture a...request, My Lady?"</p><p>Kodachi sighed. "I know what you wish," She said. "And I share that wish." Kodachi smiled sadly. "For many reasons." She nodded. "She will do what is required." She said. "After all, she is a Tendo."</p><p>"And Lady Kimi?" The retainer asked pointedly.</p><p>Kodachi looked down, though not as far down as she used to, Kodachi suddenly realized, to the listening Kiko. For a moment Kodachi was going to dismiss her but she hesitated. 'No.' She thought in decision. 'She's needs to start learnng about such things.' Kodachi turned back to the retainer. "While the word of an Ota has not been tested, I feel I will not be disappointed when it is." Kodachi looked back to Kiko. "The Kuno think far into the future." She said."But for there to be a future, there must be an heir." She explained. "They wish me to speak to Lady Nabiki about having...a child."</p><p>Kiko nodded in understanding. "But what does that have to do with, Auntie Kimi?" Began Kiko. She stopped. 'They've been speaking formally.' She thought. She bowed briefly to the retainer. "Pardon me, I meant no disrespect." She said. "I should have said Lady Kimi."</p><p>The retainer smiled approvingly. "Apology gladly accepted, My Lady." He said. "If Lady Kimi had a child and the...paternity was sufficiently verified...that child would have some...standing among the Kuno."</p><p>Kiko looked at Kodachi. Kodachi nodded in confirmation. A knowingly amused smile appeared on Kiko's face. She nodded. "I think that's...sweet." She said.</p><p>Kodachi laughed in delight. "Spoken like a true Kuno." She said in approving tones.</p><p>"Most like a Kuno." Agreed the retainer. He bowed. "If you'll excuse me, My Ladies." He said. Kodachi nodded and the retainer walked quickly out of the room.</p><p>"We should get ready as well." Kodachi said. "Oh Kiko, I bought you a new outfit." She said with a smile. "Something Madame Demille suggested." She said. "I do hope you like it."</p><p>"I'm sure it's beautiful, Auntie Dachi." Kiko said swallowing her disappointment. 'I love you Auntie.." She thought. 'But sometimes." With a quick bow she exited the room and hurried down the hallway to her own room. Kiko spent so much time at the mansion that she found herself thinking of her room here in the mansion her reall bedroom and the one in the apartment with her mom, well that was her real bedroom too but she really didn't live there. "Please. please, please no bows." She muttered as she opened the door to her bedroom. She walked in and looked at her bed. In the center of her bed were a number of boxes and packages. She sighed and walked over.</p><p>Kiko picked up the first box. "Well no matter what it looks like it must have been expensive." She said quietly as she recognized the store name on the box. She slowly opened it. When she removed the covering paper she gasped. It was a skirt, a simple black skirt, but the kind of skirt a teenager, with refined taste that is, might wear. Kiko slowly lifted the skirt out of the box and looked at it for a long moment, then she spun around to face the full length mirror near the bed and held the skirt against herself. A look of glee appeared on Kiko's face. "Thank you, Madame Demille." She said fervently. Moments later Kiko was tearing open the rest of the packages. Shoes, stockings, blouses, belts and even a clutch purse were revealed. Kiko stepped back from the bed and just stared.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The door opened to the smaller dining room and the already seated guests looked up. Koko was about to scold her daughter for keeping everyone waiting but the words caught in her throat as Kiko entered. The young girl was wearing a simple white blouse and a black skirt. A wide black belt encircled her waist. She was wearing thigh high stockings and a black ribbon was tied high on her head. She had taken the time to brush out her hair and it was obvious she was wearing makeup and it was also obvious that she had been paying attention whenever she had watched her mother applying makeup to herself and others. Kiko wore her spider pendant and she had found a bracelet that went well with both the outfit and the pendant.</p><p>Kiko bowed. "Please forgive me for keeping everyone waiting." She said in quiet tones. "It was unforgivably rude of me."</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno chuckled quietly. "I don't think my sister could have timed that better." He said giving Kodachi an amused glance. He sister didn't notice as her eyes were fixed on Kiko. "An entrance worthy of a Kuno." He said. Tatewaki bowed to Kiko. He waved a hand to the table. "Please." He said. "Join us."</p><p>"Thank you, Lord Kuno." Kiko said formally. She walked over to her chair and one of the retainers pulled it away and seated Kiko. "Thank you." She said to the retainer. Kiko turned to her Mother. "I am sorry I was late, Mother." Kiko said.</p><p>Koko's mouth worked for a moment. "Who? What?" She finally choked out. Koko swallowed. "When did you grow up?" She asked in almost sad tones. Koko reached out a hand and touched her daughter's hair. "Look Ms. Kuno." She said. "Our baby's growing up."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Pema and Kagomi looked around the third floor suite excitedly. "Look Pema, it's even got it's own home theater." Kagomi ran to a door and slid it open. "Eee." She squealed. "Dresses." She reached in. "Oh, this would look good on me." She stated in anticipatory tones.</p><p>"If you need something altered, either Suki or Koko will be able to take care of it." Noriko Mata informed the two teens.</p><p>Kagomi and Pema clasped hands and jumped around the room and squealed in glee. Pema released Kagomi's hands, turned and ran over to the tall powerfully built man leaning against the wall. "Oh Ranma, it so nice."</p><p>"Nothing but the best for my baby." Ranma cupped the Tibetan girl's chin with a powerful hand. "Are you sure you want to do this?" He asked with a touch of concern in his voice. "It's not too late to back out."</p><p>Pema stood on her tip toes and kissed Ranma on the cheek. "Pema know." She said. "Pema have four wonderful year with Ranma but it time Pema start living own life." She looked down for a moment. "Pema just hope there be always room in Ranma heart for Pema."</p><p>"Always, Punkin." Ranma replied. He wrapped Pema in his arms and rested his chin on the top of her head. "And it's not like you're leaving forever. We expect you home on Monday" He said. "Both of you." Ranma said looking at Kagomi. "Now remember, you don't have to do anything you don't want to." He said firmly. "Or be with anyone you don't want to be with." Ranma felt Pema nod against his chest. "And if anyone bothers you." Ranma stopped when Pema started giggling. "Too much?' He asked.</p><p>Pema leaned back and looked up at Ranma. She shook her head. "Not too much." She said with a smile. "I laugh because Ranma sound jealous." She teased.</p><p>"Well, maybe a little." Ranma admitted.</p><p>"Good." Pema said happily. She pushed Ranma. "Now go." She ordered. "Kagomi and Pema need get ready."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Two middle aged women approached the entrance to the inner club with nervous looks on their faces. They were not unattractive though a little matronly in appearance. Both were the wives of very successful business men who were first cousins. As such they had seen each other often from the first days of their respective marraiges to the present day and had become good friends. Normally a place such as "Ky's Cafe" would not have been somewhere they would have even considered frequenting but their sons were in their twenties and hadn't found the right girls. A mutual friend had suggested speaking to the legendary Miss Nodoka, Japan's most famous Geisha.</p><p>The meeting with Miss Nodoka had been surprisingly pleasant and she had contacted them several days later with what she said was 'good news' and had invited them to visit the club prior to the opening. Their sons had also received invitations but Miss Nodoka had requested that they arrive separately from their sons to discuss certain matters. The two women approached the massive bouncer sitting on a stool in front of the door to the inner club. "G-good Afternoon." One of the woman stammered.</p><p>"Ah, Mrs. Tamasayo and Mrs. Yamada." Abe said respectfully. "Miss Nodoka told me to expect you." He turned to press a button next to the door. "Miss Nodoka should be with you in a minute." He said. "If you'd like to wait at the..." Abe hesitated. "No, I don't suppose you would." He smiled reassuringly. "It will be only a minute." He said.</p><p>Almost a minute to the second the door to the inner club opened and Nodoka stood framed in the doorway. "Chisako." Nodoka exclaimed in greeting. "Nagisa." Nodoka stepped back and waved the two women into the club. Once they entered the club Nodoka linked her arms through theirs and led them deeper into the club and toward her private booth. "I'm so glad you were able to get here before the official opening." She said regally. "We have much to talk about."</p><p>"Is there a problem?" Chisako Tamasayo asked in concern.</p><p>"Not a problem, exactly." Nodoka said soothingly. "It's just that there is so much interest in the Crown Jewels that I'm going to need your help."</p><p>"Crown Jewels?' Nagisa Yamada asked.</p><p>"Jewel and Gem." Nodoka explained. "Surely I...oh I suppose I didn't." Nodoka said contritely. "The two girls that I spoke of are usually referred together as either the Crown Jewels or Daddy's Girls." She ushered the two women into her private booth. "Personally I prefer the Crown Jewels." She waited until the two women were settled before seating herself. "Actually Jewel and Gem are not their names." She said. "But we use those names in order to prevent unwanted...attention." She said conspiratorally. "You may have heard of them by their real names...Pema Tenzin and Kagomi Akahito?"</p><p>"Them?" Gasped Nagisa Yamada. She swallowed audibly. "Bu-but they're..."</p><p>"Two of the most eligible single women in Japan?" Purred Nodoka. "You did say you wanted women of refinement and standing for your sons." Nodoka sighed. "But herein lies the problem." She said. "as I said, there is so much interest that...well frankly the competition is going to be rather...intense, shall we say?"</p><p>Nagisa and Chisako looked at each other and then looked at Nodoka. "Wha...what can we do?" The two women gave Nodoka almost identical pleading looks. "Please Miss Nodoka, if...if our boys...oh gods, could you imagine if our boys...Oh gods, Lord and Lady Kuno would be, be..."</p><p>"Virtually your in-laws, yes." Nodoka said with a smile. "At least through Lady Kuno's sister, Akane Tendo anyway." She looked at the table and traced a random pattern with her finger. "In fact there are a number of people, associates of the Kunos, who will wish to..interview your sons to see if they're suitable." She looked up and at the now breathless women. "That is the purpose behind the bids, after all." She said reasonably. "To ensure that the...parties involved are serious."</p><p>The two women started fanning themselves frantically. "We'll do anything." They said in near unison. "We-we'll iincrease the bids." Chisako said in desperation.</p><p>"The bids were quite sufficient, Chisako." Nodoka said reassuringly. "But with all the interest..." She shrugged. "If you could see your way clear to...oh how do I put this..?" She said. "The girls are both orphans, as you know..." She said in apparent non-sequitor.</p><p>"Oh, how terrible." Nagisa said. "I didn't know." She declared. "The poor things."</p><p>"Poor things." Echoed Chisako. She pulled a handkerchief out of her purse and dabbed her eyes. "I didn't know." She said. "No parents?"</p><p>"No parents." Confirmed Nodoka. "But that's wasn't..." She stopped. "They've depended on each other for years and, I feel, they will need to be together for awhile longer." She said. "So, while I'd be very happy if they chose your sons." She said. "I don't think they are ready for anything... permanant." She said. "Not right now, anyway." She said. "But that also means that they always do things together." She said. "I know that might pose a difficulty, always double dating...your boys..."</p><p>"But, but...that's no problem at all." Chisako gushed. "Our boys are just the same." She said. "Oh don't you see, Miss Nodoka, that just means that our boys should be with the Crown Jewels." She said firmly. "They must be together." She declared. She turned to Nagisa, the other woman nodded firmly. Chisako returned her attention to Nodoka. "I know you said the bids were sufficient but..oh dear, it's the boys that are bidding." She said in concern. "Nevermind, you have our word that whatever our boys bid, we will more than match." She declared. Nagisa nodded firmly in agreement.</p><p>"Speaking of your boys." Nodoka said apparently ignoring Chisako's declaration. "Much as your sons must love you, I am afraid that your presence might inhibit them and we do want your boys to make the best impression." She pointed out.</p><p>"Oh but I so want to meet them." Nagisa said plaintively.</p><p>"Well if your not adverse to a little innocent...fun." Nodoka said teasingly. "I do have a suggestion."</p><p>End Chapter 4</p><p>Author's Notes: Not a lot to say. Hope everyone is enjoying QR Book 8</p>
