</div><p>Queen Rat</p><p>Book 6</p><p>'The Rats come out at night'</p><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight." The pretty reporter said to the camera. "I'm your host, Satchi Kato." She swivled the chair to face another camera. Pixiled images of girls pole dancing on dingy stages sequenced behind her. "Strip clubs." She said. "What is the attraction? Why do men, and a growing number of women, frequent these sleazy dens of cheap thrills and illicit sex?" She turned to another camera. "Tonight we wil talk to several eminent psychologists and get their insight." She smiled. "When we come back."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>'A visit to the Kabuki'</p><p>Kasumi held tightly to Ono's arm as they entered the Kabuki Club. Even dressed modestly, Kasumi's grace and beauty was evident. Ono was still the same, lanky, slightly befuddled man, dressed in a loose fitting suit that somehow conveyed his calling as Nerima's leading healer. "Honestly Ono." Kasumi said in annoyance. "How many times do I have to tell him I'm not entering the contest?" She looked up when Dr. Ono didn't answer."Ono, are you listening to me?"</p><p>"Oh, what?" Tofu Ono blinked and pushed his glasses back. "Sorry sweetheart." Ono said contritely. "I was, nevermind." He said hurriedly. "What did you say?" He said intently.</p><p>"Ono." Kasumi said reprovingly.</p><p>"Sorry sweetheart." Ono repeated.</p><p>"Honestly, I don't understand why my sister insists we come here." Kasumi complained. "I think she enjoys embarrassing me." She and Ono found a table off to one side of the stage. Kasumi looked around and immediately moved her chair closer to Ono's. "Ono, everyone is staring at me." She whispered nervously.</p><p>Ono put his arm around Kasumi and pulled her closer. "Don't worry sweetheart." He said reassuringly. "No one will bother you, they know better."</p><p>"Maybe." Kasumi said doubtfully. "But why do they stare so?" She asked. "I mean, here especially." She frowned when Ono coughed. "Ono?"</p><p>"Nothing sweetheart." Ono said hurriedly. He waved for a waitress. "Why don''t we have a drink." He said. A waitress in a very short skirt, tight blouse and high heels came to the table.</p><p>"Hot tea." Kasumi said firmly. "For both of us." She told the waitress.</p><p>For some reason the waitess giggled. "Coming right up honey." The waitress replied. She gave Kasumi a speculative look. "You know you look a bit like Aoi."</p><p>"My sister." Kasumi replied in slightly stiff tones.</p><p>"Really?" The waitress said excitedly. "Wow." She exclaimed. "I can't wait to see you dance." She said. The waitress hurried away.</p><p>"I'm not dancing." Kasumi called after the retreating back of the waitress. "Honestly." She complained. Spot lights lit the stage. It was an unusually large stage with room for four maybe five strippers at one time, though it was unoccupied at the moment. Kasumi looked around and noticed how the patrons of the club began to turn their attention more and more toward the empty stage. The tea arrived just as a fanfare, a jazzy saxophone solo, rumbled from the sound system.</p><p>Through the curtain walked a tall thin man in a white suit. He carried a microphone in one hand. "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen." He said. "And welcome to the Kabuki." He looked around the crowd and focused on Kasumi. A huge smile appeared on his face. "You're back." He said in pleased surprise. He sighed. "Still not gonna dance?" There were groans from the crowd at Kasumi's exasperated shout of 'No'. "Can't blame a guy for asking." He said. "Oh well, it isn't amature night anyway." He conceded. The MC gave Kasumi one last look before returning his attention to the rest of the audience. "You know, I've been working at the Kabuki for a couple years now and I've seen many a beautiful woman grace our stage." He said. "And I've loved watching them all." There were hoots of agreement from the audience. "Most of the time I didn't care if they could dance or not." He raised a finger as a chant of U.S.A. began. "I'd say I still don't care but then I'd be lying." The chant of U.S.A. got louder. "Here they are, the hottest girls on the strip, the baddest of the bad girls, the girls who put the tease back in strip tease, Kabuki's own; The one, well the three, the only" He waved a hand. "U.S.A." The crowd joined the MC in a shout.</p><p>The curtain opened. At first nothing happened then a blue haired girl, in blue halter top and matching tight blue shorts, entered backwards from the curtain. A leash was held in one hand and she was pulling on it. "Come on Sugoi." She ordered as she pulled on the leash. Aoi turned to the audience. "Sugoi was being a bad girl." She said conspiratorally. "And she needs to be punished." She turned back to the curtain. "You're just making it worse for yourself, Sugoi." She said to the closed curtain. Aoi pulled on the leash again and a silver haired woman in silver white crawled out on to the stage. Close behind a buxom redhead in a skimpy red outfit and carrying an oversized and padded paddle followed. The crowd howled in laughter.</p><p>"Ono." Whispered Kasumi. "Ranma isn't going to spank Ukyo with that, is he?"</p><p>"It's just play acting." Ono whispered back. "I think." He muttered.</p><p>On the stage, Akane as Aoi, held the leash and Ukyo now stood next to her. "Say it." Akane ordered.</p><p>"Do I gotta, Aoi?" Ukyo as Sugoi complained. "Ow." Ukyo jumped as the paddle, swung by Usagi/Ranma, connected with her ass. "I was just asking." Sugoi complained.</p><p>"Say it." Aoi repeated.</p><p>"I'm a bad girl and I should be punished." Sugoi intoned in a grumpy tone. "Ow." She exclaimed as the paddle landed again. "Hey, I said I was a bad girl."</p><p>"Oh, sorry Sugoi." Usagi said impishly. "I forgot."</p><p>"Sure you did." Sugoi replied. "Aoi, Usagi is being mean to me again."</p><p>"Oh she is, is she?" Aoi said direly. The music starting thumping loudly as Aoi and Sugoi spun around and grabbed Usagi. What ensued was a combination of erotic dance routine, cat fight and three stooges comedy bit, that eventually left the three girls, mostly, naked and the audience howling in both laughter and longing.</p><p>The reason for the overly large stage became apparent as the three girls swung from pole to pole, sometimes in apparent defiance of gravity. Low, medium and high denomination yen seemed to fly on stage as the antics sometimes had the girls sitting in a very lucky patron's lap, sometimes on a table, though usually the performance remained on the stage. Bits of clothing were found here and there draped on someone's head. Less chance then it seemed as the current possessors were the biggest tippers and the bits of clothing could be redeemed later for a favor or two. One widely beaming young man had three pieces of clothing. One from each girl.</p><p>Eventually the three nearly naked girls ended up dancing on top of a table. One particular table. Kasumi and Ono stared up at the three nearly naked girls. Kasumi's tea cup frozen halfway to her lips.</p><p>Kasumi felt her face turning redder and redder as her sister, Ranma and Ukyo, danced, wiggled and giggled on the table. Ranma especially seemed to concentrate on Kasumi. Suddenly Ranma seemed to stumble and the forgotten cup of tea in her hand spilled just as Ranma landed in her lap. Suddenly Ranma began to grow and change and there was an audible twang. Kasumi felt more than saw something fly passed her face.</p><p>"Oops." Ranma said in his male voice.</p><p>Kasumi looked at, the now male, Ranma sitting in her lap. Kasumi chewed her lip. She couldn't help it and Kasumi looked down. "Like what you see?" Ranma said in a sultry voice as Akane and Ukyo giggled. Kasumi quickly looked back up.</p><p>Ranma jumped to his feet. To Kasumi's amazement there was a burst of applause from the audience as Ranma grabbed Akane and held her in front while Ukyo jumped on his back. "Nice hat." Ranma said and raced back to the stage. Without letting go the girls grabbed the remaining bills off the stage as Ranma ducked through the curtain to wild applause. Kasumi slowly reached up and gingerly felt on top of her head. Her hand encountered something satiny and she lifted the material off her head and looked at it. Usagi's tiny red bikini bottom dangled from her hand. "Oh my."</p><p>"I'll give you a thousand yen for that." A man's voice said. Kasumi turned as a middle aged man approached. "Five thousand yen." Another man said.</p><p>"I-I'm sure Ra-ra-Usagi wants it back." Kasumi swallowed dryly.</p><p>"She does." Chorused a group of voices hungrily. Several of the hungry voices were female.</p><p>"N-no I think I'll return it myself."She said to groans. Kasumi straightened in her seat. "Ono, if you'll excuse me, I think I will find my sister." She said. "Ono?" She turned her head to see Dr. Tofu staring straight ahead, his glasses completely fogged up. "Ono." Kasumi said reprovingly. There was a crack as Kasumi's hand connected with Ono's cheek. "Ono!"</p><p>"Oh, what?" Dr. Tofu blinked, took off his glasses and cleaned them. He put them back on. "Sorry sweetheart, what did you say?"</p><p>"I'm going to find my sister." Kasumi said stiffly. "You behave yourself."</p><p>"Yes sweetheart." Ono said immediately.</p><p>Kasumi stood and made her way to the back of the club. She was stopped at the entrance to the backstage by a bouncer. "Only dancers..." Began the bouncer. He took one look at Kasumi and stopped. "Dressing room is on the left." He opened the door. Kasumi walked through the door and started looking for Akane. "Okay Akane, I know you're around here." Kasumi called loudly. A door opened.</p><p>"Hey big sister." Akane said cheerfully. She waved Kasumi into a separate room. "Come on in." She said. Kasumi gave Akane a sharp look then entered.</p><p>"Hey Kasumi." Ranma, back in female form, called. "Enjoy the show?" She asked impishly. She looked at the bikini bottom dangling from Kasumi's hand. "Oh, there it is."</p><p>"That was very naughty of you Ranma." Kasumi began. She stopped when Ranma, Akane and Ukyo broke up into giggles. Kasumi's mouth worked for a second then she joined in the giggling. "It wasn't an accident was it?" Kasumi finally asked. Ranma shook her head. "I didn't think so." She looked at Akane. "You really need to get better control over your boyfriend, sister." She handed Ranma the bikini bottom. "Did you know someone offered me five thousand yen for it?"</p><p>"That's all?" Ranma complained. "It's worth at least four times that." Ranma grinned. "You know you can redeem it for a lap dance, don't you?" She said.</p><p>"So that's why..." Kasumi looked at Ranma. "They saw you change." She said. Ranma nodded. "And they still want a, a...what you said."</p><p>"Lap dance." Ranma said. "Yep."</p><p>"This wasn't the first time." Akane giggled. "And around here, ordering hot tea usually means you're interested in the male Ranma."</p><p>"Oh, so that's why there are so many women in the audience." Kasumi said in realization.</p><p>"Oh them too, sugar." Ukyo said. "But you'd be surprised how many men order hot tea."</p><p>"Hey, if they tip good enough." Ranma said with a grin.</p><p>"Slut." Akane and Ukyo chorused. "You have no idea, big sister." Akane mock complained. "At least it's only lap dances." She grabbed Ranma's ponytail and pulled the redhead's head back. "Isn't that right?" She growled.</p><p>"Hey why would I need to cheat when my Tomboy gives me what I need?" Ranma protested cheerfully.</p><p>"Good answer." Akane leaned down and kissed Ranma hungrily. "And if you're a good girl, I may, just may, use a certain packet." Akane said when she broke the kiss.</p><p>"How about me?" Ukyo asked. "I've been good." She said.</p><p>"You've been bad and you know it." Akane replied. "Which is another reason to use the packet." Akane grinned as Ukyo rubbed her butt. Akane turned her attention to Kasumi. "So sis, how's it going with you?"</p><p>"Good." Kasumi giggled. "I really should be very, very angry with the three of you but considering how distracted Ono was, I suspect I won't be getting a lot of sleep tonight." She said.</p><p>"Anytime sis." Akane replied cheerfully. "Anytime."</p><p>Kasumi sat down on a chair and slapped her thighs with her hand. "Daddy says hello and wants to know when the three of you are coming for dinner." Kasumi began.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"This is Satchi Kato and welcome to Japan Tonight." The pretty reporter said. "Our top story, the Fallen Angels have struck again." A grainy picture showing a group of women in black cat suits appeared on the screen. The quality of the picture made recognizing features impossible. "For the third time in as many weeks, the mysterious group were instrumental in foiling an attempted rape." The picture on the screen was replaced by that of a young woman. "The victim, twenty year old Cho Umeki, credits the timely arrival of the 'angels' for her rescue."</p><p>The reporter turned to another camera. "In related news, the Terrible Three were spotted bouncing along the rooftops of Itabashi." A video showed three people, two women and one man, making seemingly impossible leaps between buildings. "And no, that isn't trick photography." The reporter voice-overed the video. "Later in our show, we will be interviewing several prominent martial artists to discuss and possibly explain exactly how they are doing it." The reported smiled. "But first, these messages."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Dressed in her usual black dress and veil Kodachi Kuno walked into the private suite used only by the girls. Kodachi had it built as part of the recent expansion of 'Ky's Cafe'. It was still the same scaled down version of Ric's Cafe American from Casablanca but, now, not as scaled down as before. Kodachi had bought the building the club resided in from the proceeds of the, now mostly legitimate, club, and her share from some of the Ice Queen's ventures. She had no need for the money and she poured everything she earned into the club. The second floor still contained the private rooms where the girls entertained their guests, though greatly updated and improved. On the third floor were more private rooms. These rooms, suites rather, were for those guests who, for one reason or another, desired to maintain another residence other than their official one. Official being even more appropriate in one or two cases. Kodachi charged heavily for both the privacy and service these suites  third floor was also the 'girls' domain. They had their own suite. Only Kodachi's girls were permitted here. This was their home away from home their inner sanctum. It was also their private training area. Kodachi looked in approval as each of the girls was engaged in some form of exercise or other training.</p><p>Makota, for instance, was tossing knives at a target. It turned out Makoto had a knack for hitting what she threw something at. Knives, darts, rocks, if she could hold it in her hand, she could generally throw it where she wanted. Not shuriken though, Kodachi didn't want Makoto to damage her hands, the knives were bad enough, but the risk was more acceptable.</p><p>Yuki and Noriko were sparring with each other, Noriko, being the closest in skill to Yuki, was a frequent sparring partner. Ami, Aoi and Fumie were going through a stretching routine together while Miki and Rei had their heads down looking through what appeared to be an instruction manual.</p><p>Kodachi clapped her hands together. "Good afternoon, ladies." Kodachi smiled behind her veil as the girls quickly assembled around Kodachi. "Good afternoon, Ms. Kuno." The girls, including Yuki, chorused in reply. "Noriko." Kodachi said. "Have you completed your reports for our meeting this afternoon?"</p><p>"Yes, Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied confidently. Noriko's hand went to caress a pendant that hung around her neck. It was an unusual pendant. A delicate gold spider with ruby eyes clutching a black pearl with it's legs.</p><p>"Excellent." Kodachi said in satisfaction. "Miki?"</p><p>"We have enough supplies for the weekend, Ms. Kuno." Miki replied. "But I've taken the liberty in contacting our suppliers. Just in case." Around Miki's neck was another gold spider pendant. Miki had recently been promoted to manager as Noriko's duties as Kodachi's aide left her little time to spare for the club.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "Fumie, I'll be expecting you to assist Koko and Auntie Nodoka tonight." She said. "Noriko has pointed out that you have been of great assistance to Miki in running the club. She has suggested that we make you assistant manager." Kodachi smiled behind her veil at the exclamations of approval from the other girls. "I am inclined to agree."</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." Fumie said gratefully. "I will do my best." She too had a similar pendant. In fact all the girls, all of Ms. Kuno's special girls, had the spider pendant.</p><p>"I have no doubt about that." Kodachi said. "Yuki, you will accompany myself and Noriko to the meeting. Wear something appropriate." Yuki nodded. "As for the rest of you, I expect it to be a busy evening, so rest up." She tapped her chin. "Oh, Makoto, are any of your gentlemen expected this evening?"</p><p>Makoto pouted. "No, darn it." She grumped. "I think Tenchi and Kojiro are out of town." She looked down.</p><p>"Problems?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"I think they may be thinking of," Makoto paused for a second. "Moving on."</p><p>"And Genji?" Kodachi asked in concern.</p><p>Makoto smiled. "Oh he's not going anywhere." She said firmly. Makoto made a face. "He's stuck in a meeting." She said. "He never eats properly when he has those meetings." She said in complaint. "He gets such terrible indigestion."</p><p>"Well I'm sure you'll take good care of him if he does." Kodachi gave the younger woman a fond and approving look. Makoto straightened at the praise. "But that does present a problem." Kodachi said. "Or maybe an opportunity." Kodachi raised her veil. "Would you have any objections to taking on a new client?"</p><p>Makoto shook her head. "Of course not Ms. Kuno." She said. "Did you have someone in mind?" Her hand went to her pendant.</p><p>Kodachi shook her head. "No." She replied. "I just wanted to know."</p><p>Author's Notes: Hi everyone, QR Bk 6 is nearly completed and I couldn't see any reason not to start posting. I hope you like it. BTW - the scene in the Kabuki was suggested by longtime reader and reviewer, Wharpt. I hope he, and the rest of you, likes what I did with it.</p>
