</div><p>Chapter 4</p><p>'A visit from Gosunkugi'</p><p>"Welcome to Japan Tonight." The pretty reporter smiled into the camera. "I'm your host, Saatchi Kato." She turned to another camera and an image of three people, a man and two women, appeared on the screen behind her. "The Terrible Three." The reporter said in identification. Another picture appeared behind the reporter. This time three women. Two of the three women were in both pictures. The third was a short buxom girl with flame red hair."And the Terrible Three?" The reporter said in inquiry. "It appears the long standing feud between Ranma Saotome and Ranko Tendo continues. The reporter looked into the camera;. "Unless you believe the incredible explanation that they are actually the same person."</p><p>Two pictures appeared side by side. The dark haired Ranma and the flame haired Ranko. The image enlarged until only their blue eyes were visible. "Tonight's topic. Ranma and Ranko, one and the same? You decide." She said. "Right after these messages."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Yuki walked into the girl's private suite at the club. It was empty except for Miki. "Hey Miki." Yuki said. "Where is everyone?"</p><p>Miki grinned. "You mean, where is Makoto?" She said teasingly. She laughed as Yuki blushed. "Your girlfriend will be here soon." She informed the Kuno retainer. She waved an admonishing finger playfully. "Should we put your name out for bids now?" She asked. "I know a couple high rollers who would be very, very interested."</p><p>"Miki!" Yuki retorted in embarrassment. "It was, I was, I mean Ms Kuno needed," She threw her hands up in surrender. "Oh I give up." She said sourly. "I should know better than to expect anyone to keep a secret around here." She sighed. "What did Makoto tell you?"</p><p>"Only that you're now, as Makoto put it, her bestest girlfriend and that Genji was very, very pleased." Miki replied. "I just put it together." Miki guided Yuki over to a small table and had her sit down. Miki poured Yuki a cup of tea. "Okay, give." She said. "What's Genji's secret?" She asked.</p><p>Yuki blushed redly. "Makoto didn't tell you?" She asked. Miki shook her head. "Then I won't either." Yuki declared. 'Bestest girlfriend.' Yuki thought. The thought made her blush even redder though it made her happy. "If Makoto wants you to know, then she'll tell you herself."</p><p>"Aw come on Yuki." Miki pleaded. "We're all dying to know."</p><p>"Uh Uh." Yuki declared. Yuki heard the door to the suite open. To her pleasure it was Makoto. Before she could say anything Makoto was already halfway across the room with her arms wide and a big grin on her face. Yuki stood and found herself being hugged by the tall girl. "Hey Mako-mmph." Yuki's greeting was interrupted by a kiss that Yuki found herself eagerly returning.</p><p>"The back bedroom is free." Miki teased.</p><p>"Maybe later." Makoto said cheerfully. She fished into her purse. "Genji got you this." She said. "I hope you like it." She pulled out a small, wrapped package. "I helped pick it out." She held out out the package with both hands. "Open it. Open it." She urged.</p><p>Yuki opened the package and gasped. It was an elegant, gold and diamond evening watch. "Oh Makoto, I can't accept this."</p><p>"Don't you like it?" Makoto asked in concern.</p><p>"Of course I like it. It's beautiful." Yuki replied. "But it's way too expensive."</p><p>"That's the whole point." Makoto said. "It's supposed to be expensive."</p><p>"But." Yuki began.</p><p>"And Genji would be very hurt if you didn't wear it." Makoto said.</p><p>"But." Yuki tried again.</p><p>"Especially this weekend." Makoto said.</p><p>"But.." Yuki stopped. "This weekend?"</p><p>"Mmhmm." Makoto nodded. "You're spending it with Genji and me. Genji insisted." She giggled. "Well after a little prompting from me."</p><p>"The weekend?" Yuki licked her lips."But Makoto, he's your boyfriend."</p><p>"Client." Miki murmured. She was surprised when both Makoto and Yuki turned to her and shook their heads in near unison. "Not client?"</p><p>"It's boyfriend, Miki." Yuki said firmly. "Especially now that Makoto only sees Genji." Makoto nodded cheerfully in agreement. "Genji really does care about Makoto." Makoto nodded even faster. "Hel-Heck, I'm surprised they're not engaged."</p><p>"You're joking?" Miki said. Yuki shook her head. "I mean, we all know Genji likes Makoto but...you don't really think he'd...you do, you really do." Miki exclaimed. She looked at Makoto. "But he knows that you're a..." Miki stopped. "Oh my."</p><p>Yuki nodded. "Oh my." She agreed. "That's why I'm hesitating." Yuki continued. "I don't want to ruin it for Makoto." She turned to Makoto. "I mean it was fun and Genji is really..." She broke off.</p><p>"Really what?" Miki pounced. "Really a good lover, really hung, really what? Come on guys." She pleaded.</p><p>"Don't worry Yuki." Makoto ignored Miki. "You wont ruin it." She grinned. "Might even get him to propose sooner." She said. "So, it's settled. You're spending the weekend with us." She said firmly. "Be sure to wear the watch."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Yuki looked at the door in front of her. She had seen that door a thousand times or more. She had been in the room beyond hundreds of times, yet she hesitated before knocking. "Do I really want to do this?" She asked herself in a whisper. The answering pang of desire shocked her. Yuki's hand went to the spider pendant around her neck. She raised her other hand and knocked. "It's Yuki, My Lady." Yuki announced herself. She heard Kodachi's voice inviting her in. Yuki opened the door to Kodachi's office and walked in. She bowed hurriedly to Kodachi and Noriko. "Excuse the interruption, My Lady, but..."</p><p>Kodachi leaned back in her chair. "Is there a problem, Yuki?"</p><p>Yuki's hands twisted together in front of her nervously. "I-I" Began Yuki. She stopped and looked down. "Genji is taking Makoto away this weekend and, and they..." She stopped again. "Genji invited me to go with them." She said in a near whisper.</p><p>Kodachi raised an eyebrow. "Genji invited you?" She asked. Yuki nodded. "Well, I'm sure I can call Mr. Morimoto and explain that he's made a mistake." Kodachi began.</p><p>"Oh My Lady." Yuki interrupted. "That's not the problem."</p><p>"It isn't?" Kodachi asked in surprise. Yuki shook her head. "You want to go." Kodachi said in sudden understanding. Yuki blushed and nodded. "I see." Kodachi tapped her lower lip with a manicured finger. "And what does Makoto think?"</p><p>Yuki blushed even redder. "It was her idea." Yuki said quietly.</p><p>"Really?" Noriko asked. Yuki nodded. "That's wonderful."</p><p>Yuki looked up in surprise. "It is?"</p><p>Noriko nodded. "Well besides the fact that it sounds like you're going to have a fun weekend, Mr. Morimoto is very important to the Ice Queen," She nodded her head to Kodachi. "And to Ms. Kuno." She looked at Kodachi. "We did sort of give the impression that it was..."</p><p>"A privilege?" Suggested Kodachi. "No." She corrected her self. "Expected." Kodachi nodded. "So we did." She gave Yuki a nod. "Enjoy your weekend, Yuki." She said. "And thank you."</p><p>"My Lady." Yuki bowed and retreated from the library.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma looked up at a knock on the door. "Yeah?" He said. There was no answer. Ranma got up and walked to the door and opened it. He frowned, no one was there. Ranma looked around then looked down. There was a large envelope lying on the ground. He stooped and picked it up. "Hmm, no address." He said. Ranma opened the envelope. Ranma smiled. He walked back into the apartment. "Hey guys." Ranma called. "Gos left us something." Akane and Ukyo hurried into the main room.</p><p>"Man I hope it's a Ryoga-Konatsu vid." Akane laughed nastily. "I want to know if Ryoga spits or swallows."</p><p>Ukyo joined Akane in giggling. "I just want to see him do it." Ukyo said. "Popcorn?"</p><p>"Popcorn." Ranma and Akane chorused. Ranma walked over to the entertainment system. It was a very large and expensive looking system. The large screen television dominated the wall. Ranma inserted the disc into the player, picked up the remote and walked over to the couch. He sat down and raised his arm. Akane jumped on the couch and snuggled next to Ranma. He lowered his arm and placed it around Akane.</p><p>"Ummmm." Purred Akane. She rested her head against Ranma's chest. Akane sighed happily as Ranma started to stroke her hair. Akane wiggled closer to Ranma. Ranma continued to stroke Akane's hair as they waited for Ukyo to return.</p><p>"You guys look comfortable." Ukyo's voice came from the door to the kitchen.</p><p>"I am." Akane said cheerfully. "Now bring that popcorn over here, we have a video to watch."</p><p>"Did you know you're bossy?" Ukyo said with a chuckle. She walked over and sat on Ranma's other side.</p><p>"Guilty as charged." Akane said. She elbowed Ranma. "what are you waiting for? Start the movie." She said.</p><p>"See, bossy." Ukyo chuckled. She sat down on Ranma's free side and leaned against him. "You heard the lady, start the movie." Ukyo said. She placed the bowl of popcorn on Ranma's lap and grabbed a handful.</p><p>Ranma chuckled and started the video. A dimly lit room came on screen. "Looks like a hotel room." Ranma said after a moment. "Looks expensive." In the video a door opened and three people entered the room. The occupants on the couch all leaned forward. Akane made a slight sound of disappointment.</p><p>"Well it's not Ryoga or Konatsu." Akane said. "I don't recognize," Akane broke off. "Hey, she's Geisha." She said. "Looks expensive too." The other people on the screen, both young men, started caressing and kissing the Geisha. "Show time." Akane said in anticipation. She grabbed some popcorn.</p><p>"How old do you think she is?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Late thirties, early forties. She's in good shape though." Ranma replied. He chuckled. "Hey maybe they're the pros."</p><p>"Ya'think?" Akane asked curiously. She grabbed another handful of popcorn. "Good popcorn, Uk-chan." Akane said. "Man, I hope my tits look that good when I'm her age." Akane commented enviously. "They're as good as Ranma's."</p><p>"No kidding, sugar." Ukyo agreed. 'She looks kind of familiar.' She thought to herself. "Whoa, the old girl's got some skills." Ukyo exclaimed suddenly. "Damn Ran-chan she's as greedy as you." She snickered. "Last time I saw someone handle two cocks like that was the last time Akane and I used the packets."</p><p>"She's coordinated. I'll give her that." Ranma agreed. He grabbed a handful of popcorn. He looked down when he felt someone 's hand slipping into his pants. "Uh-oh, someone forgot to say may I." He sang.</p><p>"Uk-chan." Akane scolded. "You know you're supposed to ask." She waved a finger teasingly. "You're going to have to be punished, you know that?"</p><p>"Whoops." Ukyo pulled her hand out.</p><p>"Hey, who told you to stop?" Ranma complained. Ukyo giggled and put her hand back inside Ranma's loose pants and resumed her caresses. "Man look at the old girl go." He said. "Maybe they're all pros." Ranma handed the bowl of popcorn to Akane. "Better hold this before Uk-chan spills it." Ranma said. Akane snorted, grabbed the bowl and put in on the floor before resuming her position against Ranma's side. "Still she does look familiar." He said. "Come to think of it, the two guys look kind of familiar too." Ranma shifted on the couch. "Oh that feels nice." Ranma murmurred as Ukyo continued stroking him. Suddenly Ranma rocked forward. "Oh crap."</p><p>"Hey." Ukyo complained.</p><p>"Stop looking at them." Ranma exclaimed in agitation. "Stop looking at them."</p><p>"What's the matter with you?" Akane asked in annoyance. "Since when are you a prude?"</p><p>"Can't you see? It's Mom. It's Mom." Ranma covered his eyes with his hands. "Yuck, ack, bleh."</p><p>"What?" Exclaimed Akane and Ukyo. Akane peered at the screen. "You know, now that I..." She elbowed Ranma who was still making noises of disgust. "Stop it Ranma." She said. Akane whistled. "Well now we know where Ranma gets it from." Akane said. She grabbed the remote and turned off the player. "Will you stop it, Ranma."</p><p>"I'm going to have nightmares for weeks." Ranma complained. "I'll kill her." Ranma said. "No, I'll kill Gos." Ranma started pacing. "No first I'll kill Gos, then I'll kill Mom." He said. "What's gotten into her?" Ranma spun around and waved a finger at Akane and Ukyo. "And no jokes."</p><p>"Damn, and I had a couple ready to go." Ukyo complained.</p><p>"So did Ranma's mom." Akane cracked. "Oh grow up Ranma." Akane said when Ranma began to sputter. "Ukyo and I will go see your Mom." She said. "You look for Gos."</p><p>"But..." Ranma began.</p><p>"Gos." Ordered Akane. "Now find him." She pointed at the door. "And bring him back here." She said. "In one piece."</p><p>"Well mostly one piece." Ukyo added. She waved her hands. "Go on, he can't be too far away." Ukyo and Akane waited until Ranma finally left before they looked at each other. "Blackmail or warning?" Ukyo said to Akane.</p><p>"Warning." Akane replied. "Gos' would know better than to try blackmail." She turned her head. "Isn't that right...Gos?" She looked into a corner of the room. "No sense pretending, I can see you." She raised an eyebrow. "Don't believe me?" She walked over to a corner and raised a fist. Before she could swing, Gos appeared, or rather he was suddenly noticeable. What before could have been, and was, mistaken for a pile of discarded clothes on a chair was now the pale and skeletal form of Hikaru Gosunkugi. He held a video camera in one hand.</p><p>"Eep." Squeaked Ukyo.</p><p>"Interesting." Gos said in his cadaverous voice. "How is it Ranma didn't see me?"</p><p>"He wasn't looking for you." Akane said. "I, on the other hand, remembered how much of a voyeur you are." She put her hands on her hips. "Not to mention he's too pissed to pay attention." She said. "That won't last." Akane warned.</p><p>"Came in with the mail didn't you?" Ukyo said. Her lips twisted. "Enjoy the show?"</p><p>"Disappointed." Gosunkugi intoned. "It ended much too soon." What might have been a smile flitted across his cadaverous features. "I was hoping to see what...punishment you were going to receive."</p><p>"I bet you were." Akane smiled wryly. "What do you want, Gos?"</p><p>Gosumkugi seemed to become more difficult to see and both Akane and Ukyo had to remind themselves forcibly that the man was there. "Consider this." Gosunkugi's voice seemed to become fainter. "A favor." Despite their best efforts, Gosunkugi now no longer appeared to be in the room. Akane blinked and then, with a sigh, opened the front door of the apartment and counted to ten then closed the door. She walked back into the room. Ukyo opened her mouth but Akane raised a finger to silence her. Akane spun in a slow circle, then blew out a breath. "He's gone."</p><p>"You sure?" Ukyo said unconvinced. "He vanished in front of us."</p><p>"Yeah, but It was a struggle." Akane pointed out. "He can't maintain it for that long." She spun around again slowly. She nodded. "Yeah, he's gone."</p><p>Ukyo rolled her eyes. "Whatever." She shook her head. "We better go see Mrs. Saotome." She said. "And let her know she was being indiscrete." She said. "Last thing I want is for Pops to find out." She smiled at Akane's snort of agreed exasperation. Ukyo walked back to the couch and sat down. She picked up the remote. "After we see the rest of this."</p><p>Akane giggled and hopped on to the couch. "Oh yeah." She said. She leaned down and picked up the bowl of popcorn. "Roll it." She ordered. The video began and Ukyo advanced it past the beginning. "Right there." Akane said. Ukyo tossed the remote to the side of the couch. "Whoa, so that's where he gets it." Akane said after watching for awhile. Ukyo laughed in agreement.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Akane. Ukyo." Nodoka said in greeting when she opened the door. "What a wonderful surprise." She waved the two women into her home. "Come in. Come in. I'll make some tea." Nodoka had the girls sit down and bustled into the kitchen. She came out minutes later carrying a tea service. "I bought one of those electric tea makers." Nodoka said. "I don't know how I ever did without it."</p><p>"Is Pops around?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"No Genma is at work." Nodoka said. "Did you want to talk to him?" She asked.</p><p>Ukyo shook her head. "No, just wanted to make sure we were alone." Ukyo sipped her tea. She examined Nodoka. Always elegant, Nodoka Saotome was dressed in her usual floral Kimono. "Were you going out?" She asked. She pointed with her chin at the Kimono.</p><p>Nodoka laughed. "Just to the club." Nodoka said. "I fear that if I didn't wear one, no one would recognize me."</p><p>"Oh, I'm sure at least two people would recognize you without it." Akane said. She sipped her tea and looked at the suddenly flustered Nodoka. "From what we saw, they could recognize you in the dark."</p><p>"What?" Nodoka licked suddenly dry lips. "What are you talking about?" Nodoka tried, and failed, to sound genuinely confused.</p><p>"Your boys." Ukyo replied. "Jiro and Daisuke. That is their names isn't it? You repeated it often enough." Ukyo shook her head. "Honestly Auntie."</p><p>Nodoka's hand went to her mouth. "How?" She gasped.</p><p>"Gos." Akane replied. "The same person who took those pictures of Nabiki." Akane sighed heavily. "Ranma knows." She announced slowly.</p><p>Nodoka wrung her hands in agitation. "Oh dear." Nodoka said worriedly. "I hope Ranma doesn't do anything rash." She said. "My boys can be very protective." Nodoka sighed. "Especially where I'm concerned."</p><p>Akane tilted her head and gave Nodoka a penetrating look. "Martial artists?" She asked finally.</p><p>"Of course." Nodoka twisted her hands together. "Oh they're not in Ranma's league but they're not helpless." She said. "And there are two of them." Nodoka fished in her pocket and pulled out her cell phone. She punched in a number. "It's me." She said. A regretful smile came to her face. "Not tonight, I'm afraid." She said. "My son knows." Nodoka chewed her lower lip. "That would be best." She said. "I'll call you." Nodoka disconnected. "Satisfied?" She asked sourly. "That is what you wanted, wasn't it?"</p><p>"Well until Ranma calms down." Akane nodded. "Don't look at me to judge you, Auntie." She said.</p><p>"Either of us." Ukyo added.</p><p>"Thank you for that." Nodoka replied. She sighed. "You probably think I'm a silly old woman but..."</p><p>"Like we said." Akane interrupted. "We, especially me, have no right to judge you." Akane smiled slightly. "And they certainly seemed to appreciate you."</p><p>"Not like a certain bald-headed fat man we can name." Ukyo said. "Just do us a favor and try to be a little more...discrete." She said. "Ranma'll calm down, eventually, and as mad as he is right now he certainly won't tell Pops."</p><p>"Oh like Genma has a reason to say anything." Nodoka snorted. "He's been through half the girls in the club." Her expression turned sour. "As if I didn't know." She said. "The old reprobate." She shivered slightly. "Pervert is more appropriate. Do you know which girl he sees the most?" Akane and Ukyo shook their heads. "Suki Uma." Nodoka said. "The redhead." Nodoka said. "He even has her put her hair in a pigtail."</p><p>"Ewww." Chorused Akane and Ukyo.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma prowled the rooftops of Itabashi. "Where is that creep?" He growled to himself. His anger at his mother had passed some time before. Oh, he was still upset but now more at Gos for invading his mother's privacy than for what his mother was doing. Running along the rooftops cooled his anger and allowed him to think more rationally. Ranma stopped at a rooftop and looked around. "I'm never going to find him." He muttered. Ranma stared out over the skyline. "I need to work off some steam." He grumbled. "Where's Pig-boy when I need him?"</p><p>Ranma resumed running along the rooftops, changing direction every so often just to keep from getting bored. His travels finally took him to an area of abandoned warehouses. Or they should have been. Ranma's eyes narrowed as he noticed several trucks parked around one supposedly abandoned building. "Don't tell me the Old Ghoul is back." He said to himself. Sinking into the Umisenken, Ranma snuck into the dimly lit warehouse and started looking around. 'Nope, not the Chinese.' Ranma decided. 'But too organized to be a new group.'</p><p>Ranma prowled around looking for some clue as to the identity of this group. It was obvious that this was an illegal operation, the fact that it was happening in an abandoned warehouse was a giveaway. 'Hmm, this is pretty close to Wasahara's territory.' Ranma realized. 'I'm surprised he hasn't noticed.' Unseen, Ranma wandered through the warehouse and started examining some of the contraband that was being stored there. Most of it was pretty innocuous; low-end luxury goods, liquor, etc., and Ranma was about to go when he heard the muffled sound of someone sobbing. Curious, Ranma made his way silently toward the sound. It was coming from a closed door. Ranma tried the door. 'Locked.' Ranma was about to snap the lock when he heard the sound of footsteps approaching. Even in the Umisenken there was still a chance of being discovered, especially if someone turned on the lights. Ranma faded into a corner and waited.</p><p>Two burly thugs approached the door. Ranma didn't recognize either one of them but that didn't really mean anything. Both of the thugs were, in Ranma's opinion, nothing more than muscle. Smart enough to follow directions as long as they were spelled out. 'With lots of repetition.' Ranma thought derisively. The two thugs opened the door to the room and entered. Ranma snuck in behind them and jumped to the ceiling. Ranma looked down and barely suppressed an angry growl erupting from his throat. Chained to a bed was a young woman, girl actually. 'I doubt she's even fifteen.' He thought angrily. 'Oh fuck it.' Ranma dropped down and knocked the two men out before they even knew he was there.</p><p>The girl's mouth opened to scream and Ranma clamped a hand over her mouth to silence her.</p><p>"No time." Ranma said shortly. He reached over and snapped the chains with negligent ease then picked up the girl in his arms. "Now quiet, until I get you out of here." Ranma said. "Hang on." With the girl in his arms, Ranma charged out of the room and across the warehouse. He jumped to the window he used to come into the warehouse. Ranma bounded out of the open yard and onto the roof of a nearby building. With the girl in his arms he jumped along the rooftops and toward home. The girl shrieked and buried her head against his chest.</p><p>Ranma looked down at the girl in his arms. "You okay?" He asked as the bounded along. The girl lifted her head and gabbled in a language unknown to Ranma, Ranma landed on a rooftop and stopped. He put the girl on her feet. "What's your name?" Ranma asked slowly. The girl again gabbled a response. 'Sounds sorta Chinese.' Ranma thought to himself. He asked again in Chinese. He patted himself on the chest. "My name, Ranma." He said in Mandarin, then Cantonese.</p><p>The girl brightened. "Pema." The girl replied. "Me Pema Tenzin."</p><p>"Tenzin?" Ranma's eyes widened. "That's a Tibetan name."</p><p>"Tibet, yes." Pema said.</p><p>Ranma raised a hand then pulled out his cell phone and punched in a number. "Tomboy?" Ranma said. "Where are you?" He gave Pema a reassuring smile. "Meet me at the apartment." Ranma said. "I think we have a problem." Ranma walked over to the girl. He held his arms out. "Pema?" The girl hesitantly approached. Ranma picked her up gently and soon they were again bounding across the rooftops. Pema buried her head against Ranma's chest and Ranma could feel her shake in his arms.</p><p>It didn't take Ranma that long to make it back to the apartment. Ranma again placed the girl, Pema, on her feet and waved her into the apartment. "Hungry?" He asked in Cantonese. He rubbed his belly. A rumbling from the girl's stomach answered the question. Ranma led the girl into the ktichen and had her sit down. There was already rice in the cooker and Ranma scooped out a large bowl. Pema grabbed the bowl and started shoveling the rice into her mouth with her hand. Ranma refilled the bowl two more times before the girl slowed down. Pema was finishing her third bowl when Ranma heard the front door of the apartment open. "In here." Ranma called.</p><p>The ktichen door opened and Akane and Ukyo walked in. Pema jumped up and tried to hide behind Ranma. "It's okay, Pema." Ranma said soothingly. "Guys, this is Pema." Ranma quickly filled Akane and Ukyo on what he'd discovered. Akane growled angrily when Ranma came to the part about Pema being chained.</p><p>"I hope you tore the place apart." Akane said. "Why not?" She snapped when Ranma shook his head.</p><p>"I had to get Pema somewhere safe first." Ranma replied easily.</p><p>"Sorry." Akane said contritely. Akane was about to say something more when Pema started moaning as if in pain. "Hey what's wrong with her?" Akane gave the young girl a closer look. "Hey, she's starting to sweat." Akane observed. Suddenly Akane grabbed the girl's arm and examined it cliosely. "Oh crap." She said. "Ranma, get some blankets. Now." She said. Ranma hurried off.</p><p>"What's going on, sugar?" Ukyo said in concern.</p><p>"Withdrawals." Akane growled.</p><p>"She's an addict?" Ukyo said in disbelief.</p><p>"I doubt it's by choice, Uk-chan." Akane patted Pema reassuringly. "It's okay." She said. "It's okay." Akane pointed at the girls arm. "Judging by the number of tracks, they've haven't been giving her the junk all that long." She said. "Long enough though." Ranma came in with the blankets and they wrapped them around Pema. "It's okay, baby." Akane said soothingly. "You'll be fine." She looked at Ukyo. "Call Ono."</p><p>"On it sugar." Ukyo already had her cellphone in her hand. She quickly relayed the information. "Ono'll be here in a half hour." Ukyo reported.</p><p>"Good." Akane picked up Pema, blankets and all, and carried her to the bathroom. "She's probably gonna start puking soon." Akane said grimly.</p><p>"Ranma." Wailed Pema. Her arm reached out imploringly to Ranma, a look of near terror on her face.</p><p>Ranma hurried over and took the young girl's hand. "It's okay, Pema." Ranma said gently. "Akane will take good care of you." With Ranma still holding Pema's hand, Akane carried the young girl into the bathroom. Ukyo followed a couple minutes later with a bowl containing a towel. Just in time as Pema started to retch violently. Akane, Ranma and Ukyo did their best to comfort the young girl while they waited for Ono. When Ono, along with Kasumi, finally arrived, Pema was shivering and moaning.</p><p>"Doc." Ranma said in relief. "Gods I'm glad you're here."</p><p>Doctor Ono hurried to the girl's side. He began pressing pressure points on the girl's shoulders and neck. "I can't do much here." Ono muttered as he worked. "She really should be in a hospital." He said. "Who is she?"</p><p>"Her name is Pema, She's from Tibet." Ranma said. "And I found her chained in a warehouse."</p><p>"That's horrible." Kasumi exclaimed quietly.</p><p>"It's worse." Ranma said. "The Tomboy thinks she was given drugs against her will."</p><p>"Akane is probably correct." Ono said grimly. "I'd say for at least a week." Ono patted the now much calmer Pema on the shoulder reassuringly. "You'll be fine." Ono said. Pema gabbled something in her language. Ono said something similar in response. The girl started gabbling even faster, Ono raised his hands and said a few more words. The girl looked disappointed but a little more hopeful. She said something. Ono nodded. "Yes, we'll get you home."</p><p>"Of course we will." Kasumi said firmly.</p><p>"I wanna know how she got here in the first place." Ranma said angrily. "And who brought her here."</p><p>"I'm pretty sure Nabiki will want to know the same thing." Kasumi didn't even try to hide her anger. "And if she doesn't I'll make certain she changes her mind." Kasumi said in very Nodoka-like tones.</p><p>"You're not alone." Akane said. "Don't worry Sis, we'll take care of it."</p><p>"Good." Kasumi said.</p><p>End Chapter 4</p><p>Author's Notes: Say hello to Pema.</p>
