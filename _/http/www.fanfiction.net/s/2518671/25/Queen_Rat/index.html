</div><p>Chapter 7</p><p>'Intermission'</p><p>Ukyo came running backstage. "Guys you wont believe who I saw out there." She giggled. "Ryoga." She said without waiting.</p><p>"Ryoga?" Exclaimed Akane in disbelief. She snorted. "He probably just got lost and ended up in here."</p><p>"I dunno sugar he headed straight to the bar." Ukyo looked at a snickering Ranma. Ukyo rolled her eyes. "You're gonna be a total slut tonight aren't you?" She said in amused resignation. Ranma nodded cheerfully. "Poor Ryoga." Ukyo said in mournful tones. "What has the Lost Boy been doing, you think?"</p><p>"Ryoga?" Akane answered in derisive tones. "Akari says he still will get lost for weeks, sometimes months, at a time. Good thing the girl has the farm." She looked at Ranma "You gonna fuck him?" She asked seriously.</p><p>"Fuck him over is more like it." Ranma said happily. She rubbed her hands together. "Pig boy still owes me." She looked at Akane. "Why? You wanna?"</p><p>"You have got to be joking." Akane replied coldly. "How bout you Ukyo?" Ukyo shook her head quickly. "So we're agreed then?" Akane said. Ranma and Ukyo nodded. "Oh good." She said cheerfully. "Ryoga eats it big time."</p><p>"This is gonna be fun." Ranma adjusted the strap of her red halter top. "What's the crowd like Uk-chan?"</p><p>Ukyo smiled as she adjusted her silver wig. "Packed sugar, packed." Ukyo looked at herself in the mirror. She was dressed in her trademark silver-white outfit. The faint chant of 'U.S.A' came to her ears. She could see Akane and Ranma in the mirror. Akane, in her Aoi personna, wore her trademark blue outfit with her long blue wig. Next to her and stretching was Ranma, as Usagi, in her red. The chant of 'U.S.A.' started getting louder. "Uh Oh the natives sound restless."</p><p>"Better throw them some red meat then." Ranma wiggled her ass. Then slapped it. "There." She said. "Now it's red." She jumped when Akane slapped her other ass cheek. "Hey."</p><p>"Well now they're both red." Akane grinned. She adjusted her wig again. "Okay girls, rent is due, let's shake our money-makers." She opened the dressing room door and walked out. Ukyo and Ranma following. Their dressing room was off from the main dressing room where the rest of the acts changed. No one disputed the three's right to their own dressing room. They knew who the draw was. More importantly they knew who the three were. Truth be told the rest of the strippers considered it an honor. Akane waved as they were greeted by the dancers.</p><p>"Break a leg guys." One of the dancers yelled in the time honored tradition of performers everywhere.</p><p>"Nah, I think we'll just bruise it a bit." Ranma called back. Ukyo and Akane snorted in amusement. "Thanks guys." Ranma waved as they left the dressing room.</p><p>The M.C. walked out from the sidelines. "Ladies, yes there are a few here, and gentlemen, and we'll find out if there are any of those here very soon. So far what I've seen isn't promising." He grinned at the chuckles. "You know, I must have the best job on the planet." He continued. "Every night surrounded by beautiful,"</p><p>"And naked." Shouted a voice from the packed group.</p><p>"And naked, well mostly." Amended the M.C. "Yes, I have the best job on the planet, and sometimes, amazingly, it gets even better." The M.C. nodded. "Now you're saying to yourself, but Tatsuo, how can it be even better? You're surrounded by beautiful and mostly naked women every night, how could it possibly be better?" The M.C. paused for a moment. "Because sometimes we find out there really is a Kami-Sama." His voice changed to a reverent hush. "One alone is almost too much for any mere mortal to handle. But three?" He waved a hand and the lights dropped. The sultry tones of a saxophone filled the room and the curtain opened. "We are not responsible for any deaths due to over excitement. Ladies and Gentlemen, Usagi, Sugoi and Aoi, U.S.A." As he called out the stage name the crowd picked it up so by the time the 'A' was sounded the crowd all but screamed it out.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo undulated toward the front of the stage. The music started slowly and the three dancers danced accordingly. Mostly they played the audience. Greeting regulars and paying particular attention to generous regulars. Money flew on to the stage prompting the beginning of a slow striptease. The more they took off, the more the customers would give them and the more the customers gave them the more, and sooner, the clothes came off. Still the Kabuki did not allow total nudity but only by, sometimes literally, the thinnest of margins.</p><p>Ranma spotted Ryoga near one end of the bar. From the rapt expression on his face Ranma deduced that a) Ryoga was enjoying himself and b) he didn't recognize them. 'Probably just looking at our tits.' She thought in amusement. 'Oh and c,' She added to herself. 'Tits don't make him spring a leak anymore.' By this time, Ranma, Akane and Ukyo were down to bras and g-strings and the bras were about to go. 'We'll see about that.'</p><p>The crowd seemed to hush and collectively hold their breath when Ranma reached behind her and unclasped her bra, her hands caught the front of the bra before it could fall. Ranma smiled seductively then she dropped the bra. The incipient cheer turned into a groan of disappointment when Ranma's hands blurred and covered her breasts. She strolled over toward where Ryoga was staring fixedly at the stage. Ranma felt more then saw Ukyo and Akane walk up and join her in her stroll toward the staring Ryoga. Like Ranma, Ukyo and Akane had their hands covering their breasts.</p><p>"He really doesn't recognize us." Akane muttered.</p><p>"Good." Ranma replied. The three stopped just in front of Ryoga. As one they leaned forward until their breasts were inches from Ryoga's face. Ryoga's eyes widened and he began to breathe audibly. The three dropped their hands simultaneously. Ryoga seemed to freeze and dropped backwards in a silent crash.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo high-fived each other.</p><p>Ryoga awoke disoriented which was not an unusual state of affairs for him. Finding three attractive women looking down coldly at him was also not unusual. It used to happen often when he was a teenager. Though not recently. Recently it would usually be just one face; Akari. The look of disapproval was familiar as, now that Ryoga was actually looking at the faces of the women, the faces themselves. Ryoga swallowed nervously. "Oh shit." He croaked. "Hey Ranma." He looked at the other two faces. "Akane. Ukyo." He said slowly. "Fancy meeting you here."</p><p>"Save it Ryoga." Akane said coldly. She took a breath and let it out slowly. She walked over and squatted down under she was eye level with Ryoga. "The only reason we haven't beaten you to a pulp yet is because we can't decide on who takes the first shot." She cracked her knuckles. "Any suggestions?"</p><p>Ryoga swallowed again. "What are you mad at me for?" He asked plaintively. Ryoga glared at Ranma.</p><p>"Do I have to have a reason?" Akane replied in the same cold tone. "And stop glaring at Ranma." She reached down and pulled Ryoga to his feet.</p><p>Ukyo chuckled. "Who'd have imagined Ryoga Hibiki walking into a strip club?" She said. "And not by accident."</p><p>"Who'd have imagined Ukyo Kuonji working in one?" Ryoga shot back. "Now Ranma I could see but you and Akane." He looked at Ranma. "It's your fault I just know it."</p><p>"What was that?" Ranma said dangerously.</p><p>"Actually it's my fault." Akane said seriously. "Just like a lot of the shit we went through was my fault. I was a spoiled little brat and everyone knows it." Akane smiled slightly. "And that is the real reason you still have all your teeth." She walked over to a small refrigerator. "Drink?"</p><p>"Anything but cold water." Ryoga sat up and looked around. He spotted the silver-white and blue wigs sitting on their stands on the dresser. "Gotta admit you guys were hot." He turned his head. "Even you Ranma." He accepted a beer from Akane.</p><p>"Even?" Sputtered Ranma. "Even?" She stood up and advanced on Ryoga. "I'm hot period." She said angrily.</p><p>"You're a guy." Ryoga shot back. "I know that and you know that."</p><p>"Not right now I'm not." Ranma snapped. "Admit it, you were turned on."</p><p>"Oh just fuck him already." Akane grumbled.</p><p>"I am not going to fuck him." Ryoga and Ranma chorused while pointing angrily at each other. "He's just afraid I'll turn back into a guy in the middle of it." Ranma continued.</p><p>"You would too." Ryoga growled. "Find another butt hole to play with, mine's off limits."</p><p>"And that's why I won't fuck him." Ranma said to Akane and Ukyo in disgust.</p><p>Ukyo looked at Akane. Akane was looking back shamefacedly and yet triumphantly at the same time. She was pretty sure her face was a mirror of Akane's. Ukyo looked at at Ranma. She nodded. "Okay Ryoga can stay in the guest room for a while." She looked at Ryoga. "If you want company find your own."</p><p>Ryoga spread his hands in both defeat and acceptance. The expression on his face showed more than a faint touch of disappointment. "I think I can manage. Thanks for the offer of a place to stay but I can manage that as well." He said. "Anyone besides me hungry?" He asked. "My treat."</p><p>"Ryoga Hibiki has money?" Ukyo said in disbelief. "What you do, rob a bank?"</p><p>Ryoga grinned. "Better." He replied. He flexed his arms to the side. "You wouldn't believe how much money you can make street fighting." Ryoga puffed out his chest. "I'm the best."</p><p>Ranma snorted. "Yeah right." She said dismissively. "You ever fight Hikaru Nakamura?"</p><p>Ryoga's eyes narrowed. "Not yet." He replied. "You?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Yeah." Her lips curled briefly into a small smile before her face returned to it's serious demeanor. "I took him but he's not someone to take lightly."</p><p>Ryoga grinned. "If you took him then he's lunch." He tilted his head. "What's he got?"</p><p>"Chestnut fist, some decent chi attacks, can't take a punch though." Ranma shrugged. "Yeah, you probably could take him but he's been training with the Old Ghoul for at least a year, maybe two."</p><p>"I'll keep it in mind." Ryoga stretched. "Dinner?"</p><p>"Let's go." Ranma said. She reached out her hands to Akane and Ukyo. She looked at Ryoga. "Like Ukyo told ya, find your own."</p><p>Akane raised an eyebrow. 'Jealous? Ranma?' She looked over the redhead's head at Ukyo. By the smug look on her face she picked up on the tone as well. Ukyo felt Akane's eyes and turned. She shrugged. "Still in the running." She mouthed.</p><p>"At least for now." Akane mouthed back but she couldn't help cuddling closer to Ranma. "Hey Ranma." She said. "How about going guy?"</p><p>"Please Ranma." Ukyo begged in support of the idea. "Akane and I are in the mood for some man meat tonight."</p><p>Ranma rubbed her chin. "Hmm let me see, sounds like I'm gonna be working hard tonight." He said musingly.</p><p>"You'll get a Blue and White special." Cooed Akane. She grinned as Ukyo reflexively rubbed her ass. "Please."</p><p>Ranma laughed. "You talked me into it." She said. "Be right back." Ranma hurried to a closet and grabbed a set of clothes, a splash of hot water and Ranma was shrugging on a white mesh shirt. "Thought I'd go as Big Daddy." Ranma grinned.</p><p>"Wait a minute." Akane said cheerfully. She walked over to the closet disrobing as she walked Ukyo followed suit and two nearly naked girls in high heels were rummaging through the closet.</p><p>"Better have another beer, Pig Boy." Ranma said calmly. "This'll take awhile." He looked at Ryoga. "You might wanna change your shirt or something." He nodded at the closet where Akane and Ukyo were holding clothes against their bodies.</p><p>"Where's my pack?" Ryoga asked. Ranma nodded toward a corner. "Just picked up some laundry." He explained as he pulled out a wrapped package. He unwrapped the package and pulled out a clean shirt.</p><p>"Still going for the tiger stripe look, I see." Commented Ranma.</p><p>"Hey it works for me." Ryoga quickly pulled on the clean shirt. He noticed Ranma looking. "Dream on Ranma." He sneered. "Always knew you were a faggot."</p><p>"Occassionally." Ranma replied. "And if you're not careful this 'faggot' will kick your butt." A wry grin came to Ranma's face. "Wanna spar tomorrow?"</p><p>"Sure." Ryoga grinned.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Slow down Ryoga." Ranma admonished. "That steak isn't going anywhere but your stomach." Ryoga ate like a machine. He'd slice off a large chunk of the Kobe beef, stuff it into his mouth and chew. 'Exactly twenty times.' Ranma thought in disbelief. He'd counted.<p>"You never know." Ryoga replied after swallowing. He cut off another large chunk of meat. "In my experience it's better to eat as much as you can, when you can. Sometimes meals can be few and far between."</p><p>"Not lately." Ranma replied pointing at Ryoga's gut. "Slow down dude. People are staring."</p><p>"Gods Ranma." Ryoga complained. "You sound like Akari." He waved a meat laden pair of chop sticks. "Speaking of which; you haven't told her you found me have you?" Ryoga sighed when Ranma, Akane and Ukyo shook their heads. "Well don't." He said. "Don't get me wrong, I really like Akari but I ain't ready to settle down."</p><p>"Don't look at us to judge you." Ukyo said matter-of-factly. "We knew that the moment you walked into the club."</p><p>Ryoga nodded. "Cool." He said easily. He stuffed another piece of Kobe beef into his mouth and chewed. Twenty times.</p><p>"So besides street fighting; what else you been doing?" Asked Ranma.</p><p>"This and that." Ryoga replied. "Load and unload cargo ships, trucks, whatever, some of the better clubs hire me for security, that kind of thing." He looked at Ranma, then his gaze went to Akane, his gaze lingered and he smiled to himself. "You've grown." He said in admiration. Then he turned to Ukyo. "Why the hell did you ever want to hide those?" He said in an almost angry tone. He shook his head. "What a waste."</p><p>"Told ya." Ranma said to Ukyo.</p><p>"I'm going to have to agree with Ryoga." Akane replied. She shot Ryoga a sharp glare. "Hey Ranma, you mind if I warm Ryoga up for you tomorrow?" She smiled coldly at the powerful martial artist.</p><p>Ryoga pulled back slightly and changed his focus. "You're bigger then you used to be, all of you." He said after a moment of assessment.</p><p>"Naturally muscular, remember?" Akane said without taking her eyes off of Ryoga.</p><p>"Boob job?" Ryoga asked curiously.</p><p>"They're mine Ryoga." Akane replied in annoyance.</p><p>"Thank Gigi for that one, sugar." Ukyo said. Ranma nodded in agreement. "I don't know if we should introduce you to Gigi." Ukyo continued. "She's a bit older than you."</p><p>"Hey older women are nice, their bodies may be sagging a little but man do they know what to do with them." Ryoga said in obvious admiration. Suddenly Ryoga grinned and pulled out his wallet. He extracted a card and handed it to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma looked at the card. "What's a M.I.L.F.?" He asked. Ranma looked at the card again. He laughed. "Hey girls." Ranma said after a moment. "Ryoga is doing porn."</p><p>"Reality Videos." Corrected Ryoga. He grinned. "I only did it a couple times." He shook his head. "You would not believe how hard it really is. We'd cruise around for hours before we'd find someone." He said. "But they'd treat you pretty good. Put me up in some nice places, fed me, got me laid and paid me to do it."</p><p>"Whore." Akane said triumphantly. "You're a whore."</p><p>"I am not a whore." Ryoga shot back angrily.</p><p>"You're a whore Pig Boy." Ranma said agreeing with Akane. Ukyo nodded as well. "You got paid for it, you're a whore." Ranma shrugged. "So're we." Ranma continued. "So is everyone else who has to work for a living."</p><p>"Tell it sister." Akane and Ukyo chorused quietly apparently ignoring Ranma's current form.</p><p>Ranma grinned and raised his arm into the air. Akane and Ukyo raised theirs along side his for a moment. Ranma put his arm down. "Ah you do what ya gotta do, we ain't judging." Ranma continued. "But we're definitely not introducing you to Gigi."</p><p>Ryoga sat back and patted his stomach in contentment. "Man that was good." He waved over the hovering waiter. "Another beer and bring the check." He told the waiter. The man nodded and hurried away. Ryoga looked at his watch. "Three A.M. " He announced. "You guys wanna head home or what?"</p><p>"Yeah!" Akane and Ukyo chorused.</p><p>The check arrived and Ryoga paid, with a credit card Ranma noted, and they left the restaurant. As they exited the restaurant Akane and Ukyo each captured one of Ranma's arms and laid their heads on Ranma's broad shoulders. "Let's walk for a bit." Ranma suggested. He grinned. "Maybe we'll run into a bad guy." Akane and Ukyo laughed, though Akane's laugh seemed more predatory than Ukyo's.</p><p>Ryoga trailed the trio. His memory kept on replaying the scene in the club. He always thought Akane was attractive and he admitted a bit of an attraction to Ukyo but until he saw them dance it was attraction, now it was more lustful. 'He's got both, I'm sure one or the other may be interested.' He told himself. 'Even Ranma can't keep two women satisfied. Not for long anyway.' As if reading his mind Akane turned her head and looked coldly at Ryoga. 'Maybe not.' He amended to himself. "Hey guys, I think I'll head off. Night." Ryoga leaped onto the nearest roof and raced away.</p><p>Ranma watched him race off. "Hey I forgot to give you our address." He shouted after the retreating figure. "Darn."</p><p>"Don't worry Ranma, he'll be around." Akane said. "Besides he left his pack."</p><p>"I guess you're right." Ranma replied looking off into the night sky. Then he smiled and pulled Akane and Ukyo closer. "Now didn't someone promise me a Blue and White special?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane woke and reluctantly left the very warm and comfortable bed to go to the bathroom. She glanced at the clock and grimaced. 'Seven thirty. Bleh." When she returned from the bathroom she paused to look at the spread futons. Ranma and Ukyo were still sleeping but they had one leg intertwined. Akane lay down next to Ranma. Ranma shifted slightly and his arm reached behind and pulled Akane closer. "Greedy." She whispered cheerfully. "And jealous." Akane snuggled up closer to Ranma. "I love you Ranma." Akane whispered. "I'll always love you." Akane closed her eyes and fell asleep.<p>Ukyo smiled behind closed eyes. 'I know you do sugar.' She thought. She suppressed a snort. 'Yeah he's greedy, but so are you.' Ukyo smiled when she felt Akane's arm reach around Ranma and rest on her shoulder. 'And he wasn't the only one who was jealous, now was he?' With a smile on her face Ukyo fell back asleep.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane was sitting cross-legged on the roof of the apartment building under the watchful eyes of Ranma and Ukyo. Ranma leaned forward and watched intently. "She's so close.' He whispered to Ukyo. "Can't you feel it?"<p>Ukyo swallowed and nodded. "This is the coldest her chi has been yet." Ukyo turned her attention back to the dark haired girl. "And the longest she's maintained it."</p><p>"Yeah." Ranma whispered back with admiration evident in his voice. "Come on Tomboy." He urged quietly. "You can do it."</p><p>Akane felt herself going deeper into the Soul of Ice. Deeper than she had ever gone before. The world, her thoughts, took on a clarity she had never experienced, ever. She opened her eyes and looked at Ranma and Ukyo sitting together. A wisp of jealousy seemed to try to gain attention. Akane just shrugged it off. 'Stupid to be jealous.' She thought with a touch of, not amusement exactly. 'He's still here.' A sharp pang of sadness, quickly suppressed, came over Akane. 'For now.'</p><p>"Concentrate Tomboy." Ranma scolded lightly. "You're almost there."</p><p>Akane concentrated and tried to suppress her negative emotions even more. Tried to find a balance. There was a moment of resistence then a cold yet comforting calmness settled over her. She heard yet didn't acknowledge Ranma's sudden intake of breath. Her mind seemed to turn crystalline and her thoughts raced without the hindrance of emotions. "So peaceful." She murmured. She looked at Ranma.. "This is so strange." She looked at her hands as if she'd never seen them before. "I feel...empty." She looked back at Ranma. "No hate. No anger. No jealousy. All gone." Her voice became a near whisper.</p><p>"No love. No desire." Ranma replied. "I know."</p><p>"I could stay like this forever." Akane said. A note of pleading entered her voice. "I can't, can I?"</p><p>"No Tomboy." Ranma replied. "Time to come back."</p><p>Akane nodded and released control of her chi. Emotions came flooding back into her awareness. Akane's eye's snapped wide open. A strangled sob erupted from her throat. Akane's mouth opened in a scream. She immediately found herself in Ranma's embrace. "I got ya Tomboy." She heard Ranma murmur.</p><p>"Is that normal?" Ukyo asked in horror. Ranma shook his head. "What happened?"</p><p>Ranma stroked Akane's hair until she stopped trembling. "Sorry Tomboy." He said contritely. "I never expected that to happen." Akane nodded against his chest. "It didn't happen to me like that." He looked over to Ukyo. "I just got kinda sick." He said. Ranma looked down. "Sorry Tomboy." Ranma stood and scooped Akane into his arms. "Let's go home." Ranma said quietly. "Coming Uk-chan?"</p><p>Ukyo nodded at Akane. "Maybe later." She began only to be interrupted by Akane.</p><p>"Don't go Ukyo. Please." Akane begged from the cradle of Ranma's arms. "I. I. Please." She said almost incoherently. "Just come back with us, okay?"</p><p>"Sure sugar." Ukyo replied with concern in her voice. 'I hope we're not going to have to keep a round the clock watch on her.' With Akane in his arms Ranma bounded toward their apartment. Ukyo paced Ranma and kept a worried eye on Akane. They quickly reached the apartment and Ranma, with Akane still in his arms, walked over to the couch and sat down and placed Akane in his lap. Ukyo sat down next to them. When Akane reached out her hand Ukyo took it and squeezed in comfortingly.</p><p>"I'm okay now." Akane said though she made no move from Ranma's lap. "Thanks for coming back." She said. "Gods that was horrible." Akane repressed a shudder.</p><p>"What happened sugar?" Ukyo moved closer to Akane and put a hand on her shoulder. "You almost looked like you were in pain."</p><p>"No almost about it, Uk-chan." Akane replied shakily. A sad laugh escaped from her mouth and she pressed herself closer to Ranma. "I didn't realize how sad and angry I really was until just now." She looked up. "Ranma?"</p><p>"Yeah Tomboy?" Ranma replied quietly.</p><p>"Why do you put up with me?" Akane asked in a serious tone. "I'm mean, spiteful, get angry for no reason. I'm no prize." She finished sadly.</p><p>"You're too hard on yourself." Ukyo said. "I would never call you spiteful."</p><p>Akane barked a short laugh. "Thanks Uk-chan." She snuggled against Ranma. "It's scarey to find out just how much you hate yourself." Akane blew out a breath. "Is that what you meant when you said you didn't want to come back?"</p><p>"I never screamed." Ranma maintained his tight hold on Akane. Despite Akane's apparent recovery he could feel the slight tremble that shook her body. "But yeah." Ranma grimaced. "When you're in it, like you said, you're empty. Your mind, I don't know, it gets faster. It's a rush, ain't it Tomboy." Akane nodded against Ranma's chest. "Now that you know how to do it, it'll be easier the next time."</p><p>Akane nodded again though reluctantly. "Maybe getting there will be easier but coming back," Akane shuddered. "At least for me." She leaned her head against Ranma's chest. "Why do you put up with me?" She asked again. "Either of you."</p><p>"Hey hey." Ukyo scolded. "Who else can I trust to watch my back?" She said. "Besides, you're a lot of fun to be around." She smiled. "When you're not so moody, that is." She said in a slightly scolding tone. "Now why don't the two of you go cuddle while I make something to eat." Ukyo watched Ranma stand up with Akane in his arms and they disappeared into the larger bedroom. Then she walked into the kitchen and looked in the refrigerator. "Tempura." She decided. "Akane's favorite." While she bustled around the kitchen she hummed to herself.</p><p>Akane passively let Ranma remove her clothes, he removed his own and then he lay down next to Akane and pulled the bed's blanket over the two of them. Akane rolled against Ranma and sighed when Ranma wrapped her in his arms. "Would you mind really just cuddling, Ranma?" Akane asked in a small voice.</p><p>"Sure Tomboy, whatever you want." Ranma said in a comforting tone. "You know that, don't you?" Ranma felt Akane nod against his chest. "Good."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki sat at her desk her hand unconsciouslly drummed a pen against the desktop. Kimi looked up from the computer. "What's up Nabs?" Kimi asked. "You've got that look on your face again."<p>"I think I've made a mistake." Nabiki said after a moment. "Or rather I think I was being too cautious." Nabiki stood up and walked to the edge of the desk closest to Kimi and sat down. "Narumi and Wassamura may have accepted me as Oyabun but it's still conditional."</p><p>"Wassamura more than Narumi." Kimi said in correction. "But," Kimi stopped and waved her hand at Nabiki. "What do you have in mind?"</p><p>"Originally we planned to wait until Hikaru made the first move, while we consolidated our control. " Nabiki rubbed the bridge of her nose. 'But Ting Li's presence is an opportunity to cripple Hikaru's organization maybe permenantly."</p><p>Kimi nodded in agreement. "Taking away his Chinese connection would hurt him. That's been his source of drugs and guns, after all."</p><p>"Exactly." Nabiki's expression became predatory "If we're sucessful we'll have them begging to join us." Nabiki rubbed her hands together. "And the first thing we have to do is introduce Ting Li to Ranma."</p><p>"And then?" Kimi chewed on the end of her pencil for a moment. "A first strike?" She smiled at Nabiki's nod. Her smile and Nabiki's became predatory. "Good." Kimi's smile dimmed. "You know lover boy is going to want to go in with them."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. A helpless smile came to her face. "I wouldn't want him any other way Kimi."</p><p>"He takes that Samurai stuff seriously doesn't he?" Kimi looked at Nabiki. "You too." Kimi leaned back in her chair. "You know it's funny." She said musingly.</p><p>"What is?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"I think I'm beginning to take it seriously too." Kimi's smile matched Nabiki's. "I wouldn't want either of you any other way."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Ting Li huh?" Ranma appraised the orange haired woman in front of him. They were standing in the Tendo dojo, where Ting Li had been staying since she got into Japan. Nabiki felt this was the best place. Ranma had agreed. It was nearly two weeks before Ranma, Akane and Ukyo could get to Nerima. It had taken a day before they had a chance to really talk to Ting Li.<p>"Yes Honored One." Ting Li said in a strong voice.</p><p>"I hear you were this year's village champion." Ranma said.</p><p>"Yes Honored One." Ting Li said.</p><p>"Interesting." Ranma said musingly. He rubbed his chin. 'Strong, bet she's fast.' He grinned as a thought came to him. "Hey Tomboy." Ranma said. "Front and center."</p><p>Akane backflipped over to Ranma. A couple weeks of being coddled by Ranma and Ukyo had erased the tension from the black haired girl's face. "You called?"</p><p>"Yeah, I want you and Ting Li to spar." Ranma replied. "Start off slow, okay Tomboy?"</p><p>"You got it Ranma." Akane said cheerfully. Akane tightened the sash of her favorite yellow gi and walked to the center of the dojo. She waved Ting Li over with one hand. "Come on girl, show me what ya got."</p><p>"But," Ting Li began. Then she took a closer look at Akane. 'Damn she looks strong.' She said in a quick assessment. 'And if she's been trained by Ranma.' A momentary pang of doubt came over the Amazon. Ting Li bowed to Ranma then walked to stand in front of Akane. The two women bowed to each other respectfully.</p><p>"Begin." Barked Ranma.</p><p>Akane flowed toward Ting Li and launched her attack. Ting Li blocked and countered. It didn't take long before Akane was able to take advantage of her greater strength. A straight right hand send Ting Li reeling backwards. Akane could see the orange haired girl's eyes widen in suppressed shock. Ting Li growled and attacked.</p><p>This time Akane retreated though she was able to successfully, though not easily, deflect Ting Li's blows.</p><p>"The girl's not bad." Ukyo commented from the sidelines. "I think she figured you out Akane." She called teasingly.</p><p>"As if." Snorted Akane. 'She's good.' She admitted to herself. 'But so am I.' Akane captured Ting Li's arm between her hands and converted it into an arm drag. Akane pivoted on her toes and tossed Ting Li into the air. Ting Li back-flipped easily and landed on her feet. Her arms up in guard position. Akane raised her hands palm out. "Nice." She said in admiration.</p><p>Ting Li tilted her head in a short bow. "Thank you." She replied easily. "You faster then you look." She added a moment later.</p><p>"You're a lot stronger then you look." Akane pursed her lips. "Can you work in a team though?" She asked. "Hey Ranma, how about you and Ting Li against me and Uk-chan?"</p><p>"I willing." Ting Li said quickly. 'Aiyah a chance to fight alongside Ranma.' She gave Ranma a hopeful look.</p><p>"Me too Ran-chan." She walked over to Akane. "Feeling good today, I see." She leaned over and the two women met in a kiss. "Let's show'em what we can do, okay sugar?" Ukyo said when the kiss broke.</p><p>"You got it sugar." Akane replied with a grin. She turned to a drop-mouthed Ting Li and a slightly concerned looking Ranma. "Well, we sparring or not?"</p><p>"This is gonna hurt." Ranma muttered. He grinned. "Let's do it."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ting Li staggered into the large bathing area. Her shaky legs seemed barely able to support her. "Aiyah." She moaned. "I thought training at home hard." She made her way to a stool against one wall and sat down heavily. "Everything hurts." She complained to no one. A chatter of voices made her turn tiredly on the stool. Three people limped, dragged and cheerfully groaned their way into the bathing area. Ting Li's eyes widened in shock when Ranma walked in naked with his towel around his neck.<p>"Hey Ting Li." Ranma said immediately upon seeing Ting Li. "Great match."</p><p>"Eep." Squeaked Ting Li. She covered her eyes.</p><p>"Eep?" Ranma said in surprise. He looked down. "Oops." He shrugged. "Oh well, I'll be a girl in a moment anyway." And saying that, Ranma walked over to a tap and splashed himself with cold water. "Better?" She asked.</p><p>Ting Li nodded slowly. "Y-yes. Better." She stammered.</p><p>"Wipe the drool off your face sugar." Ukyo said to Ting Li. She sat down. "You did pretty good fighting against us." She said conversationally. "Didn't think you'd last that long."</p><p>"Me neither." Ranma said sitting on Ting Li's other side Akane sat next to Ranma. Ranma soaped up a sponge. "Turn around Tomboy, I'll wash your back."</p><p>"You wash mine Ting Li." Ukyo ordered. "House rules."</p><p>Ting Li grinned slightly. "We have same rule at home." She said. She soaped up a sponge. "You honor me greatly today." She started to wash Ukyo's back. "But not understand why you win. Ranma better fighter."</p><p>"Akane and I are used to working together." Ukyo replied. "A little lower please." She ordered. "Ahh, right there."</p><p>"Hedonist." Akane laughed. "Fighting as a team is different. In some ways easier, but mostly it's different." Akane sighed happily when Ranma kissed her on the back of the neck. "Later." She scolded cheerfully. "We have company."</p><p>"Darn." Ranma mocked grumped. Ranma leaned forward. "I'm not gonna get a lot of sleep tonight am I?" She whispered into Akane's ear.</p><p>"Nope." Akane giggled. "But I'll let you decide what you want to be." She whispered back.</p><p>"Oh good." Ranma replied.</p><p>Ukyo snickered at the whispering voices. "Why you laugh?" Ting Li asked.</p><p>"Ranma lost." Ukyo said cheerfully. "Akane is just claiming her prize." She smiled. "Turn around I'll do your back."</p><p>"Prize?" Ting Li was looked at the giggling Ranma and Akane. "Oh." She said after a moment. "You claim prize too?" She asked over her shoulder.</p><p>"Don't worry, Ranma got you covered." Ukyo said cheerfully. "Besides you didn't know that rule."</p><p>"Oh." Ting Li repeated. "Lucky." She complained in an envious tone. She smiled at Ukyo's giggle. "He your man too?" She looked back at Ranma and Akane. "Woman." She amended. Ukyo nodded cheerfully. "Lucky." She said again. "Any way I get in line?" She asked impishly. Her smile dropped as Ukyo stiffened. "Hey, just kidding."</p><p>"Look do me ," She stopped. Ukyo looked at Ting Li. "We don't own him." She forced herself to say. "Just do us the favor of not hiding it okay?" She looked over Ting Li's shoulder to the obliviously affectionately acting Ranma and Akane. "You ask." She said seriously. "You don't just show up in his bed. You ask or he asks and then you tell us." She raised a hand. "House rules."</p><p>Ting Li looked at Ukyo for a long moment then turned her head to look at Ranma and Akane she turned back to Ukyo. "She kill me." She said after a moment.</p><p>"She'll hurt you first if you sneak behind her back." Ukyo replied. Ukyo shook her head. "Think of it as a good reason to think really, really hard about whether it's worth it." Ukyo stood. "Hey guys, stop fooling around, I want a good soak before dinner."</p><p>Ting Li watched enviously as Akane and Ukyo cuddled against the now male Ranma. Her mind went over what Ukyo told her. She gave Ranma an appraising look. 'I'm not sure what to make of what Ukyo said.' She thought. "She was saying it was okay and not okay at the same time.' She looked at Akane and then Ukyo. 'They're not fighting for his attention.' She realized. 'But they're both giving him lots of attention. Does he pick one at a time or both?' The fact that they let her bathe with them was surprising. She moved slightly see if she could get Ranma's attention. He looked up and smiled at her. Ting Li smiled back tentatively.</p><p>"You about ready to get out?" He asked with a smile. "I'll get out first if you're bashful." He added cheerfully.</p><p>"You just want to flash her." Akane said. She rolled her eyes. "You'll have to forgive the jerk but he's a total slut." She said. "And he'll never pass an opportunity to prove it." She looked at Ranma. "Oh go ahead, she's earned a peek." Ranma stood.</p><p>"Aiyah." Ting Li said in awe when Ranma's full assets came into view. She splashed herself with water and blinked. "It real." She breathed. She looked at Akane and Ukyo. The looks on their faces was self-satisfied and hungry. 'I hope we become really, really good friends.' Ting Li thought. Akane turned her head and gave Ting Li an appraising look of her own. 'Oh gods, I know that look.' Ting Li gave Akane a friendly smile.</p><p>Akane grinned wryly. "Okay Ranma, enough showing off. Get out of here. We'll meet you at the dinner table."</p><p>"Later Ting Li." Ranma slung his towel over his shoulder and walked, though walked was not the appropriate description. Ranma seemed to almost ooze out of the room.</p><p>"Where he learn walk like that?" Ting Li breathed when Ranma left the room. She, Akane and Ukyo left the furo and began to dry off.</p><p>"Gigi taught him the basics." Ukyo replied. "He's had a lot of practice since then."</p><p>"Think she teach me?" Ting Li looked at the door. "Lucky." She said. She looked at Akane and Ukyo. "I hope, really hope, we be friends." Ting Li said aloud what she had been thinking..</p><p>"Why? So you could fuck him?" Akane asked in cool tones.</p><p>"Yes and no." Ting Li said honestly. "So you not kill me if he ask."</p><p>Akane snorted. "Well I have to give you points for honesty." She said grudgingly. "If he asks what will you do?"</p><p>Ting Li met Akane's gaze unflinchingly. "You really think I say no?"</p><p>Akane sighed. "No." She grumbled. "Will you ask?" She asked a long moment later.</p><p>Ting Li shook her head. "He yours. That easy to see. Why you share, I not know." She wrapped a towel around her head. "Not know if I could do same." She nodded her head at Ukyo. "But now see why we lose. You trust each other, lots."</p><p>Akane and Ukyo looked at each other for a moment. They shared a brief smile. Akane turned back to Ting Li. "Yeah, we do." Akane said. "Now." She tilted her head questioningly. "Interesting that you think that was our advantage."</p><p>"It very great advantage." Ting Li said firmly. 'I think I like these women. Smart, talented and practical.' She thought. "You never worry about what behind you. Cause that where she is " She said pointing her chin at Ukyo. "Among Joketsuzoku there legend of Spirit Sisters. Aiyah, they great warriors. Fought many battles win every battle except one."</p><p>"What happened in the battle they lost?" Akane asked though her tone said she knew the answer.</p><p>Ting Li nodded. "They die." Ting Li replied simply. "Same time from same blow. There only chance for one to escape and live and neither took it." She inclined her head in a short bow. "I think you just like them."</p><p>"Did they have a man too?" Ukyo asked in a quiet voice. Ting Li nodded. "What happened to him?"</p><p>"First he destroy entire village of people who kill them then he go live in monastery for rest of life." Ting Li smiled. "He love them very much."</p><p>"Think the jerk would go live in a monastery?" Akane asked Ukyo. Ukyo nodded. "Yeah, I think so too." Akane said. She looked at Ting Li. "You know how to dance?" She asked.</p><p>"Dance?" Ting Li. "What you mean?" Akane and Ukyo's faces broke into slow smiles.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ting Li watched in open jawed wonder as Akane performed a slow strip tease in front of the afternoon crowd at the Kabuki. "By all the ancestors." Ting Li said in hushed tones.<p>"Good isn't she?" Ukyo said. "That's right baby." Ukyo called to Akane. "Show'em how it's done."</p><p>Akane grinned and shimmied her hips at Ukyo. She smiled broadly at the sparse crowd. "How you doing boys?" She said in her baby Aoi voice. "You happy to see Aoi?" She strolled panther like down the stage toward one open mouthed patron at the end. "Hey baby." She looked down at the seated patron. "Didn't I see you last Friday?" The man swallowed and nodded. He fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a stack of low and middle denomination notes. "Came prepared huh?" The man nodded again. "Then baby this is your lucky day.'</p><p>Ukyo leaned over to Ting Li. "She'll have that stack and whatever is in his wallet before she's through." She informed the orange haired amazon. She nodded toward where Akane had apparently enveloped the man's head between her  giggled.</p><p>"She not doing what I think she doing?" Ting Li whispered</p><p>"Unless his tongue is really, really long " Ukyo repllied. "He's only getting a really, really good view. Akane can crack walnuts between her thighs."</p><p>"And this how you make money for Ranma?" Ting Li asked.</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "For Ranma?" She said. "Oh honey you totally have the wrong idea. Ranma dances too." She perked up as Akane spun away from a dazed, smiling and somewhat poorer man at the end of the bar. Akane walked back to where Ukyo and Ting Li were sitting at the other end of the bar.</p><p>"So what do you think?" Akane stared down at Ting Li. "Think you can do this?"</p><p>"Me?" Squeaked Ting Li. "You want me do that?"</p><p>"You think we're going to let you within ten feet of Ranma if you don't?" Ukyo said.</p><p>End Chapter 7</p><p>Author's Notes: Just setting things up for later.</p>
