</div><p>Chapter 9</p><p>'You must remember this'</p><p>Nodoka bustled around Kodachi as the young woman got ready for her date with Ky Young Ji. Kodachi was reluctant to involve the older woman considering how she had her dress the first time. To her surprise, this time Nodoka insisted Kodachi where a short black dress with a red leather waist length jacket. "Not that I'm complaining Auntie." Began Kodachi.</p><p>"Good." Interrupted Nodoka. "Don't." She ordered. "It is my understanding that you will be accompanying Mr. Young Ji to one of his private clubs." Kodachi nodded. "You must make the right impression." She said firmly. "Nabiki has told me some of what you may expect, I suspect she has only told me part of it. Regardless, there will be other women there."</p><p>'Other women.' Kodachi thought in a combination of amusement and nervousness. 'Prostitutes, she means.' Kodachi licked dry lips. "Yes Auntie."</p><p>"You must remind these women of two things." Nodoka said firmly. "One that your young man is taken."</p><p>Kodachi smiled slightly. "Yes Auntie." She replied. "And the second thing?"</p><p>"That you will not look kindly on any woman who doesn't accept the truth of the first thing." Nodoka said. "And you will not look kindly, do you understand?" She shook a finger. "You will make that very clear." She said sternly. "At the same time, you will also make it clear that you support Nabiki's ideals. Even if you don't."</p><p>Kodachi looked down. "I know why Nabiki is doing that." Kodachi said quietly. "I-I saw what," She swallowed. "I saw her face Auntie." Kodachi looked up. "I may not like what they do, but no one deserves to be treated like that."</p><p>"Good." Nodoka declared in satisfaction. "You're beginning to understand."</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Kodachi said quietly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi looked at the building in front of her. It was a nondescript building, no more than three stories in height, located on the edge of a commercial district. The kind of place that normally would have housed a mix of business and apartments. In fact the first floor was a business, a bar to be exact. She firmed her grip on Ky's arm as he led her into the building.<p>Inside was indeed a bar. It was small and dark but lively in the forced desperate way of bars in marginal areas. At the bar sat a number of men drinking or talking to one of several women that were there. The women's eyes all turned toward Kodachi as she entered. To Kodachi's surprise the looks were, while not friendly, were the looks that one professional might give another. 'They think I'm one of them.' She thought in embarrassment. 'Well, aren't you?' Kodachi answered herself. Kodachi put a friendly smile on her face while maintaining a possessive grip on Ky's arm.</p><p>Ky ignored the patrons of the bar and led Kodachi to a door near the back, next to which sat a large, burly man in a suit. Kodachi realized the man had already recognized Ky and was already beginning to stand. "Mr. Young Ji." Rumbled the burly man.</p><p>"Abe." Ky replied in greeting. "This is Ms. Kuno, she always has access to the back."</p><p>Abe raised an eyebrow but didn't argue. Working for the Korean had been good for Abe, and never as good as it had been recently. If the boss wanted his bitch full access, Abe shrugged and opened the door. "Nice meeting you Ms. Kuno." Abe rumbled.</p><p>"Abe." Kodachi said politely. She let Ky lead her into the back room. Kodachi's eyes widened. The outer bar may have been ordinary, but the back room was not. To Kodachi it was like entering a new world. "Very impressive Ky." She whispered. "I see you liked Casablanca."</p><p>"My favorite movie." Ky admitted.</p><p>"It's amazing how you were able to get the feel in such a limited space." Kodachi said in a more conversational tone. There were a half a dozen linen covered tables on one side, a bar in the center rear and, what Kodachi assumed, was gambling. Kodachi shrugged internally. 'I don't see why I should be surprised.' Kodachi thought. 'Nabiki would not have a problem with gambling.' She looked at the gambling tables. 'Come to think of it, neither do I." Kodachi smiled. "That looks like fun." She suppressed a laugh. "Ooh roulette." She looked at Ky. "May I?"</p><p>Ky grinned. "Go ahead." He said. He waved a tall thin man over. "Lew." He said. "This is Ms. Kodachi Kuno. Give her a credit line of what?' He looked at Kodachi. "Five hundred thousand yen?"</p><p>"I can afford more than that, Ky." Kodachi said impatiently. "A million yen will be fine." She added. She looked at Ky's face. "Please?" She begged cutely.</p><p>Ky laughed. "A million yen." He agreed. "Ms. Kuno wants to play Roulette." He told the thin man. Ky led Kodachi to the Roulette table as the thin pit boss called another subordinate over. By the time Ky and Kodachi reached the Roulette wheel a stack of chips was waiting for them. Ky looked at Kodachi. "Let me guess; you learned to play in France."</p><p>"The Riviera to be exact." Kodachi replied. She placed some chips on a black square. "Seventeen black." She said. "My lucky number." Kodachi made a few more bets. All black, Ky noted.</p><p>"Drink?" Ky asked. "Your Brother gave me a case of the '92." He said appreciatively.</p><p>"Indeed?" Kodachi replied. "I assume then that this is your," She looked around for a second. "Office?" She guessed. She saw another door near the bar. "Or rather, this is the waiting room." She amended. "And the '92 will be adequate."</p><p>"Waiting room." Laughed Ky."I never thought of it that way before." He called another person, a woman over. Ky whispered something in the woman's ear. Her eyebrows shot up and she gave Kodachi a sharp glance. She walked away, though she gave Kodachi several backward glances as she left. When she returned she carried a wine bucket in one hand and a folding table in the other. A pair of glasses dangled from her fingers. She quickly set up the bottle.</p><p>"Would you like anything else?" She asked. She shot another questioning glance at Kodachi. Kodachi shook her head and the woman again walked away.</p><p>Kodachi raised an eyebrow. 'Whatever is the matter?' She thought. Kodachi turned back to the roulette table. An hour later Kodachi and Ky were still at the table. Kodachi was down, juar a little, but she didn't care. She was having fun. "oh ho ho ho." She laughed quietly. A man walked over and whispered in Ky's ear.</p><p>"I have to talk to some people." Ky said.</p><p>"Do you want me to go with you?" Kodachi asked. 'Remember what Auntie said, be helpful but don't push.' She told herself. To her gratification the expression that appeared on Ky's face was of serious consideration. To her disappointment he shook his head.</p><p>"Not this time." Ky said. "Just because I have to work doesn't mean you do." He smiled. "I won't be long." He said and walked away.</p><p>Kodachi looked after Ky for a moment and then returned to the Roulette table. "Seventeen Black." She announced. She played for a short time before she noticed the waitress from before sidle close to her. Kodachi waited until the woman was standing next to her before she looked up. "Hello." Kodachi said. "Did you wish to speak to me?"</p><p>A slightly twisted smile came to the woman's face. "She did say you spoke funny." The woman said. "But that you were an alright broad."</p><p>"Who said that?" Kodachi asked strangly pleased.</p><p>"Koko." The woman replied. "Koko Kobiashi."</p><p>"Koko?" Kodachi smiled in delight. "You know Koko?" Kodachi stuck her hand out. "My name is Kodachi." She said.</p><p>The woman looked at Kodachi's hand in surprise and took in cautiously, though the handshake that followed was firm. "Noriko." The woman replied in a more confident tone. "Yeah, Koko and I go way back." Her expression became sad. "I told her Toshio was no good." Noriko blew out a breath. "That was really nice; what you did."</p><p>"Toshio was trying to hurt her." Kodachi replied. "We couldn't leave that unanswered."</p><p>"I wasn't talking about that, though that was good too." Noriko replied. "No, it was that whole thing with the makeup." She explained. "She still talks about it."</p><p>"Does she?" Kodachi said in surprise. Kodachi sighed. "I wish I could have done more." She said regretfully.</p><p>Noriko gave Kodachi a strange look. "What you did, I didn't think was possible." She said firmly. "She goes out." She said in satisfaction. Noriko smiled. "I hear she even has a job lined up."</p><p>"That's wonderful." Kodachi said happily. "Oh I'm so glad." Kodachi gathered up her chips. "Please see to these." She said to the pit boss. "How about we sit down for a moment."</p><p>Noriko shook her head. "Look, I just really wanted to thank you, for Koko." She said. "I'm still on duty."</p><p>"Please." Begged Kodachi. "I know no one here."</p><p>"Well, how about we go to the bar?' Noriko said. "We can talk between me serving drinks. Maybe introduce you to some of the girls." She leaned over. "They're dying to talk to you, you know."</p><p>"They are?" Kodachi asked. Noriko nodded. "Oh dear." Kodachi said quietly. "I'd love to meet them." She added hurriedly.</p><p>"Really?" Noriko said in surprise. "Well if you're serious, come on."</p><p>Kodachi followed after Noriko to the bar. There Kodachi was introduced to the bartender, who went by the name of Mak, and several of the women that were sitting idly at the bar. "Here she is." Noriko announced to the women. "The woman Koko told us about." Kodachi immediately found herself the center of attention.</p><p>Kodachi didn't know what to expect. 'They're so...normal.' She thought in amazement. One of the woman was a round and bouncy, another serious, all of them attractive, but what surprised her was they were all different. 'I guess I was looking for a 'type'.' Kodachi thought.</p><p>As expected they asked her about Ky. Her response of taking it slow elicited chuckles from all the women. "Well he must think you're something special." One woman observed.</p><p>"Why do you say that?" Kodachi asked in a tone that was both pleased and surprised.</p><p>"He hasn't been seeing any of us." The woman replied. "He used to, you know." The woman's tone was slightly challenging.</p><p>"No." Kodachi replied slowly. "I didn't." Kodachi thought about it for a minute. "Well," She said finally. "I can't fault Ky for his taste." She admitted. She smiled at the chuckles that her comment evoked. The atmosphere seemed to ease somehow, as if Kodachi had passed some unspoken test. Kodachi smiled slightly. "Do you like working for Ky?" She asked.</p><p>"Put it this way," The round and bouncy girl said. "Even before the Ice Queen laid down the law, working in this club was as good as it gets." The was a murmur of agreement from the other women. "Ky has always been pretty much alright."</p><p>Ky Young Ji walked back to the Roulette table. He frowned when Kodachi wasn't there. He looked at the croupier. The man pointed to the bar and went back to the game. Ky looked at the bar. He spotted Kodachi talking to some of the working girls and walked over. As he approached Kodachi spotted him. To Ky's dismay she said something to the other women and they all broke into laughter. To his pleasure though, Kodachi stood as he neared at raised her face for a kiss which Ky happily obliged. "having fun?" He asked.</p><p>Kodachi smiled. "Oh yes." Kodachi took Ky's arm possessively. "I even learned a thing or two." She laughed quietly. Kodachi turned to the women and waved a cheerful goodbye. "They like you." She said as they walked away. "I never thought that would be an important consideration before." She smiled at Ky. "Did your meeting go well?"</p><p>Ky waggled a hand. "Mostly." He replied. "Nothing I couldn't handle." He said in confident tones. Ky looked at Kodachi. "So, what do you think?"</p><p>Kodachi didn't answer for a minute. "I think," She said finally. "My Brother was right, I know nothing." She looked around. "It's not what I expected." She laughed. "You don't want to know what I expected." Kodachi looked at Ky with a wry smile. "Let it suffice that I have been wrong in many of my assumptions."</p><p>"If you say so." Ky replied with a short laugh.</p><p>"Do you have anymore business to attend to tonight?' Kodachi asked quietly. Ky thought about it for a moment then shook his head. "Oh good, in that case how about showing me your apartment?" Kodachi said quietly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane looked up from the cradle of Ranma's arms at the sound of a light snore. She smiled at Ukyo who was sleeping cradled in the crook of Ranma's other arm. Akane reached over and brushed Ukyo's hair lightly. Ukyo stirred slightly and made herself more comfortable. The snoring stopped.<p>"She's cute when she snores." Ranma said quietly.</p><p>"She's cute all the time." Akane replied in the same quiet tone. "You were jealous." Akane said in quiet accusation.</p><p>"Yeah, well." Ranma began.</p><p>"It's okay." Akane interrupted. "So was I." Akane looked at the sleeping Ukyo. "Good thing she's sleeping. " Akane said with a quiet laugh. "She's got a big enough ego as it is." Akane smiled. "You're quite something, Ukyo Kuonji." She whispered. "Sleep tight baby."</p><p>The next morning the three found themselves bouncing across the rooftops in an intricate game of follow the leader with Ranma, in male form, leading. Ranma turned and thumbed his nose at the trailing women. "Nyahhh." He teased. "Can't catch me."</p><p>"Just you wait Saotome." Akane threatened with a laugh in her voice. "Come on Uk-chan, it's wabbit season." Akane picked up her pace and Ukyo fell in easily behind her. 'Always covering my back.' Akane thought. 'Spirit Sisters. I like that.' They slowly closed the gap to the fleeing Ranma.</p><p>Ranma turned his head and turned it forward quickly. 'Man they're really cruising.' He thought in admiration. He wasn't about to let on but he was running almost at his maximum and Akane and Ukyo were catching up. Even better they showed no sign of slowing. Ranma concentrated on keeping just ahead of the two women.</p><p>Ukyo concentrated on keeping pace with Akane. 'This is the life.' She thought happily. 'Running across the rooftops with my two favorite people.' Ukyo couldn't help feeling pride in hers and her partners prowess. 'We're mean. We're lean. We're one hell of a fighting machine.' Though she didn't know it, and it probably wouldn't surprise her if she did, similar thoughts ran through the minds of both Ranma and Akane.</p><p>Ranma threw his head back and laughed in the sheer enjoyment of being alive. His laughter was picked up by Akane and Ukyo. Ranma slowed his pace slightly and let Akane and Ukyo catch up. They seemed to know he had eased off and they contented themselves running along either side of him. Ranma grinned suddenly and pointed. "water tower." He shouted. They veered slightly and headed for the water tower.</p><p>Minutes later the three sat on the edge of the water tower with their legs dangling over the side. "This is the life, huh guys?" Ranma said. He turned at Ukyo's laugh. "Uk-chan?"</p><p>"I was just thinking the same thing just a little while ago." Ukyo replied with a grin. "And I wouldn't trade us for anything." She said. "And not just because the sex is so good." Her grin widened at Ranma and Akane's laugh. She butted Ranma playfully with her shoulder. "Even if you are a slut." She added.</p><p>"A guy does one little lap-dance and he's branded for life." Ranma mock complained. He grinned at the amused snorts coming from Akane and Ukyo. "Okay, so it was several lap dances."</p><p>"There wasn't a empty seat in the house." Akane rolled her eyes. "Or a dry pair of pants." She giggled. "Honestly Ranma, how many lap dances did you do that day? Ten, fifteen?"</p><p>"Seventeen." Ukyo said. "I counted."</p><p>"Okay, okay." Ranma threw his hands up in defeat. "So I'm a slut. What can I say?" He said. "I was still coming to terms with, well being me."</p><p>"We know baby." Akane said warmly. "So were we." She looked across Ranma to where Ukyo was nodding in agreement. "At least it was only lap dances, it could have been worse."</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Thought about it." He admitted. He grinned. "Stopped thinking about it when you got the instant spring water." He shook his head. "Or rather I think about it but only with you guys."</p><p>"Ooh that was smooth." Akane purred. "Good boy."</p><p>"Do I get a prize?" Ranma asked in innocent tones.</p><p>"You are such a slut." Akane and Ukyo chorused. Akane and Ukyo exchanged looks. "I think that can be arranged." Akane said. Akane made to stand when she was suddenly knocked down by Ranma. There was a sound like an angry hornet and a ping as something hit the water tower.</p><p>"Gun." Shouted Ranma. Ignoring his own safety Ranma grabbed Akane and Ukyo and shielding them with his own body hustled them to the side of the water tower. There were several spangs as more bullets hit the top of the tower. With the two women in his arms Ranma rolled off the top of the tower and hung from the edge by his feet. "You guys alright?" He asked in concern.</p><p>"I'm fine." Said Ukyo.</p><p>"Me too." Akane untangled herself from Ranma and grabbed the edge of the tower with one hand. Ukyo did the same. "How about you?" Akane started checking Ranma for injuries with her free hand. Akane breathed a sigh of relief when she couldn't find anything wrong. "Did you see where the shots came from?"</p><p>"Yeah, that tall building." Ranma replied. "If I hadn't seen the light reflect off of it." Ranma blew out a breath. "We were lucky."</p><p>"I'll argue about whether you're lucky or just damn good later." Akane replied. "What do we do now?"</p><p>"Find the shooter?" Ranma suggested. "meanwhile let's get the fuck out of here." Ranma started climbing down the side of the tower head first. Akane and Ukyo followed. They reached the underside of the tower where they were protected by the support beams. The three used the shadows underneath the tower to go as deep into the Umisenken as the shadows allowed. "Whoever it was, was waiting for us." Ranma said seriously.</p><p>"Or looking for us." Ukyo said musingly.</p><p>"Same thing, isn't it?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Not exactly." Ukyo looked out from the shelter of the support beams. "I don't see anyone." She reported. "No, what I mean is; what if we were the victims of opportunity." She waved a hand. "This isn't our normal route. In fact this is the first time we've been on this tower."</p><p>"Good point." Ranma rubbed his chin. "Bounty hunters?"</p><p>"Sounds possible." Akane agreed. "You thinking of someone in particular?"</p><p>"Haven't heard from Jerkamura." Ranma shrugged. Nabiki had told them of Hitoshi's return to the area. "His style." An eager expression appeared on Ranma's face. "Man I hope it's him." He said almost hungrily.</p><p>"He's not going to come back unless he thinks he can beat you." Akane said with a touch of heat in her voice. "You did think of that, didn't you?"</p><p>"Sure." Ranma replied cockily. "So what? He either can beat me or he can't. I'm not gonna worry about it." He jabbed his thumb into his chest. "It's not like I've been slacking off, ya know. Not with you two to keep me on my toes."</p><p>Akane and Ukyo open and closed their mouths with audible clicks. They looked at each other then back at Ranma. They looked at each other again. "Why do we keep thinking he's dumb?"</p><p>"He works at it." Ukyo replied. "Thank you Ran-chan." She said. "So, now what?"</p><p>"We call Nabs, tell her we got shot at and have her start looking." Akane said firmly. "Meantime we start our own search." She scratched the tip of her nose as she thought. "Better warn Konatsu and Ting Li as well."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Sasuke!" Bellowed Tatewaki.<p>The diminutive Ninja dropped from the ceiling. "You called Master?" He said from a kneeling position.</p><p>"How goes the search for Nakamura?" Tatewaki growled. He started pacing. "That foul villian has crossed the line. Assassins. And not honorable assassins but cowards who hide behind a gun. Guns!" Tatewaki strode over to one corner of his office where his sword stood on a polished stand. He grabbed his sword and unsheathed it. "Find him Sasuke." Tatewaki said in a low voice. "Ranma is not his only target."</p><p>"I know that Master." Sasuke snapped. The unexpected behavior caused Tatewaki to turn around in surprise. "Sorry Master, I haven't slept." Sasuke said contritely.</p><p>"No the apology is mine to give." Tatewaki replied. Tatewaki sheathed his sword. "I worry old friend." Tatewaki said. "I worry for My Ladies." Tatewaki took a deep breath. "Get some rest Sasuke." He ordered. "But before you do, send my Sister to see me."</p><p>"At once Master." Sasuke vanished.</p><p>Tatewaki walked over to the bar and made himself a drink. "This must be dealt with." He muttered to himself. He was freshening his drink when the door to his office opened. Tatewaki looked up to see Kodachi enter. "Sister." He said in sober greeting.</p><p>"Brother." Kodachi returned. "I hope this is important, preparations for your engagement ball are reaching a critical stage."</p><p>Despite his concerns Tatewaki smiled. "Nothing you cannot handle." He said offhandedly. "I trust you are not too busy to ignore this latest threat."</p><p>"Your Ladies briefed me." Kodachi admitted. 'Gods I must remember to stop underestimating Kimi. The detail.' She thought in awed remembrance. "I have enlisted Ting Li and Konatsu 's aide." She ,barely, suppressed a snort of amusement. "Ryoga may even be available."</p><p>"Excellent." Tatewaki said in pleased tones. "I knew I could count on you."</p><p>Kodachi looked down suddenly. "D-do you truly know that Brother?" She asked nervously.</p><p>Tatewaki walked over to Kodachi and, to the gymnast's surprise, hugged her. Kodachi stiffened in shock then relaxed into a long missed embrace. "Aye Sister." Tatewaki rumbled. "What you did was wrong." He said firmly. "But you are redeeming yourself." He said warmly. "In everyone's eyes."</p><p>"Thank you Brother." Kodachi wiped at her eyes for a second. "You are all too forgiving." She stepped away. "If you'll excuse me." She said. "I really do have things to do."</p><p>"So busy." Tatewaki said in amused approval. "I fear Ky is feeling slighted by now." He laughed at Kodachi's blush.</p><p>"Brother." Kodachi said in a scolding tone. She turned and almost ran out of Tatewaki's office. She did pick the pace into almost a jog as she traveled down the long corridor. She turned a corner and opened the nearest door and walked in. Konatsu looked up from a bridal magazine waved a welcome and went back to the magazine. Around the room, a dining room that had been converted into a command center for the upcoming ball, among other things. Kodachi walked over to her desk and sat down and started sorting through the stack of messages that had accumulated while she was away. Phones rang and were answered by a number of women Kodachi had hired for that purpose.</p><p>Konatsu looked up as he heard Kodachi groan. "Problem girlfriend?" Konatsu asked. "Or rather, another problem?"</p><p>Kodachi sat back and rubbed her temples. "A minor one but annoying nonetheless." Kodachi replied with a sigh. She picked up a telephone and punched in a number. "Hello?" She said when the phone was answered. "Akane? It's Kodachi, I have to talk to you about Ranma's sex, please don't hang up." She said in a rush. "Thank you." She said after a long pause. "What I meant, is Ranma coming to the engagement ball as a man or a woman?" She asked. "What do you mean you don't know?" Kodachi nearly threw the phone across the room but restrained herself. "Your Sister's engagement party is going to be the event of the season." She said. "I don't care if it's three months away." The room quieted as Kodachi shouted into the phone. "Do you realize how little time three months is? The least you could do is not make it more difficult. Now. What is Ranma coming as?" Kodachi rolled her eyes. "Fine. By the end of the week. Thank you." She gritted out. Kodachi hung up the phone. She looked up at the sound of someone clapping their hands together.</p><p>"Beautiful." Konatsu cheered. "Poetry even." Konatsu walked over to Kodachi's desk. "You do bitch so well." He said enviously."If they stall send Auntie after them." Konatsu said. "In fact just tell Auntie they're stalling now."</p><p>Kodachi raised an eyebrow. "And you say I do bitch so well." Kodachi said archly. A smile came to her face. "Oh ho ho ho, why Konatsu what a wonderful idea." She laughed. "I'll call her now."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Not that I'm complaining." Nodoka said as Konatsu bounced from rooftop to rooftop with Nodoka safely held in his arms. "But I could have taken the bus."<p>"This is faster Auntie." Konatsu said cheerfully. 'Besides the sooner I get Auntie there the sooner the fireworks will start.' Konatsu hid a gleeful smile. 'Oh this is going to be fun.'</p><p>Nodoka looked around as they bounded across the rooftops. While not her favorite mode of transport, Nodoka was getting used to it. She had to admit it was faster. A trip that might have taken an hour by bus was accomplished in less than half the time. Nodoka did admit to preferring having Ranma carry her but that was to be expected. Because she was looking she was the first to see a figure approaching. "Isn't that Ryoga." Nodoka pointed.</p><p>Konatsu looked. An almost evil smile came to his face. "Why so it is?" Konatsu replied. "Hang on Auntie." Konatsu landed on the next roof and used his chi to disperse the extra energy and inertia generated by roof hopping making his landing soft and gentle. "I think he wants to talk to me."</p><p>"My he doesn't look happy." Nodoka commented as Ryog approached. She turned. "Konatsu." She said in a scolding tone. "Have you been teasing Ryoga?" She asked impatiently. "You know how sensitive he is."</p><p>"Well maybe a little Auntie." Konatsu admitted sheepishly. He looked at the disapproving look on Nodoka's face. "I'll be good." He promised contritely.</p><p>Ryoga landed on the roof. "Konatsu!" He yelled angrily. "Get your sorry bu...oh hello Mrs. Saotome."</p><p>"Ryoga." Nodoka said in greeting. "Can you and Konatsu please put off playing right now. I need to see my son immediately." She said sternly. "You better be prepared to explain if you can't." She added. "I really am in a hurry." She crossed her arms. Her fingers began to drum against her upper arm as Ryoga hesitated in answering. "I thought so." She said. "Now I want you two to each say you're sorry." She rasied a hand. "I don't care what it was; it's obviously not serious." Her hand snapped up again when Ryoga began to protest. "The only words I'm interested in hearing from you is; I'm sorry."</p><p>"Sorry? Me?" Complained Ryoga. "Konatsu is the one who should apologize."</p><p>"I'm willing to kiss and make up." Konatsu said in hurt tones. "But Ryoga is being mean."</p><p>"Konatsu." Growled Ryoga. "If Mrs. Saotome weren't here." He said threateningly.</p><p>"Well I am here." Nodoka said tartly. "And if you aren't going to apologize then we must be going." She walked over to Konatsu. "We're late." She waited until Konatsu picked her up. "Now if you'll excuse us."</p><p>"Bye Ryoga." Konatsu said sweetly. "Call me." He mouthed. With a giggle, Konatsu leaped into the air.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma opened the front door of the apartment. "Mom!" He exclaimed in a happy tone. "This is a surprise. Come on in." Ranma took in the expression on his mother's face. "Uh oh, what did I do wrong now?"<p>"You could stop fooling around and let Kodachi know what you plan on being at the engagement party." Nodoka said as she entered the apartment. "And don't roll your eyes at me. This is serious."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah." Ranma replied. He led his mother into the apartment where Akane and Ukyo were sitting on the couch. They immediately jumped up to greet Nodoka. "Mom wants to know what I'm gonna be." Ranma said.</p><p>"Auntie I think you are underestimating the problem." Akane said dryly.</p><p>"I better make some tea." Ukyo said. "This is going to take awhile." Ukyo walked into the kitchen followed by Konatsu. "So how's it going sugar?" Ukyo asked as she bustled around making tea and something to eat. By long habit, Konatsu joined her as they cooked.</p><p>"You don't know how much I miss this Miss Ukyo." Konatsu said cheerfully. "Auntie is great and all that but it isn't the same." Konatsu started assembling the tray. "Other than that, things are going fine." Konatsu giggled. "Really fine."</p><p>"You didn't really fuck Ryoga." Ukyo asked. "Did you?"</p><p>Konatsu buffed his long fingernails on his chest. "Did you doubt?" An evil grin came ot Konatsu's face. "Of course Ting Li's distracting him did help."</p><p>Ukyo giggled. "I always thought you were a 'bottom'."</p><p>Konatsu giggled. "Well I am, but I have been known to make exceptions." Konatsu said. "Besides, Ting Li said it made Ryoga wiggle more." He and Ukyo shared another giggle. Konatsu finished arranging the food on the tray. "I'll take this." He said and picked up the tray. Ukyo followed with the tea service. They walked back into the main room. "Tea's up." Konatsu said.</p><p>"Oh good." Akane said. "I was running out of small talk." Akane accepted a cup of tea. 'Gods am I glad Auntie is such a stickler for protocol.' She thought.</p><p>Nodoka blew on her tea to cool it while she waited for everyone to be served. "Okay stop stalling how will you be attending?" She said finally.</p><p>"I ain't stalling Mom." Ranma complained. "It's not as easy a decision as you think."</p><p>"Why not?' Nodoka asked impatiently. "What is the difficulty?" She frowned at the chorus of amused chuckles coming from Ranma, Akane and Ukyo. "Okay, what am I missing?"</p><p>"Take a look at Ranma for a moment Auntie. What do you see?" Akane asked.</p><p>Nodoka looked at Ranma, she frowned. "My son." She said firmly. "Though I wish he didn't wear so much makeup when he's a boy." Nodoka's voice trailed off. "You're complexion is different as a girl." She said. "Are you going to tell me the real problem is makeup?" She asked in exasperation. "You are, aren't you?"</p><p>"I like looking right." Ranma said defensively. "I know, I just know, I'm gonna get splashed with water." he said. "My makeup is gonna run and I'm gonna look stupid." Ranma pulled at his pigtail. "I really hate looking stupid."</p><p>"You hate not looking hot." Akane corrected. "And I know exactly how that feels." Akane put her hand companionably on Ranma's shoulder. "I still think we should all go as girls."</p><p>"Yeah." Agreed Ukyo. "Though I still don't know if we should go as U.S.A."</p><p>"Good thinking girlfriend." Konatsu said. "It's Nabiki and Kimi that are supposed to be the center of attention." Konatsu smiled slightly. "I'm going to have to side with Ranma on this one Auntie." He said. "If he were a girl, you wouldn't think twice about it."</p><p>Nodoka sighed. "I suppose you're right." She admitted. She looked at Ranma. "I would really like it if you went as a man Ranma." She raised a hand. "As a compromise, why don't you bring a change of clothing, for later."</p><p>"what do you think guys?" Ranma asked Akane and Ukyo. They nodded. "Okay Mom, you got a deal, Guy first, girl later."</p><p>End Chapter 9</p><p>Author's Notes: Ah, here we go. I promised it was going to heat up.
