</div><p>Chapter 8</p><p>"No good deed goes unpunished'</p><p>Kodachi knocked on the door of Tatewaki's suite, a muffled voice told her to come in. Kodachi entered the suite. Kodachi saw the door to the balcony was open and she could see three figures seated at a table on the balcony. She walked over.</p><p>"Ah sister." Tatewaki said in greeting. "Please join us."</p><p>Kodachi sat at the remaining seat. "Thank you Brother." She said as she sat. "Good morning Lady Tendo, Lady Ota."</p><p>"Tea?" Asked Nabiki. When Kodachi made to reach for the tea service, Nabiki stopped her. "Please, let me." She poured tea for Kodachi. "I thought you did an excellent job on the announcement." Nabiki said conversationally.</p><p>"Thank you Lady Tendo." Kodachi replied quietly. She sipped her tea.</p><p>Nabiki turned to Tatewaki. "Why don't you run along baby." She told the kendoist. "Kimi and I want to have a little talk with Kodachi." She smiled. "Wedding plans and the like."</p><p>Tatewaki rose quickly to his feet. "Ah. Mayhaps this would be a good time to work on that new kata." He said. "Ladies, if you'll excuse me." He bowed and walked quickly out of the room.</p><p>"The boy learns quickly." Kimi said cheerfully. She turned her gaze to Kodachi. The look in the blond's eyes was not friendly but neither was it hostile. Kodachi felt she was being measured. She saw that Nabiki was giving her a similar assessing look. "The announcement was good." Kimi said in admission. "And you know what happens to people who do a good job."</p><p>"They get a tougher job." Nabiki supplied. "There is a ball coming up. I want you to coordinate it."</p><p>Kodachi put down the tea cup before she spilled its contents. "You want me to do it?" She asked in surprise. "Oh ho ho ho. That will be so much fun." Kodachi blanched. "Excuse me, I forgot myself," She stopped when Kimi placed a hand on her arm.</p><p>"I think we can forgive you." Kimi said. "This one time." She smiled as she said it.</p><p>"Do you really want me to make the arrangements?" Kodachi asked in suppressed excitement. Nabiki nodded. "Thank you." Kodachi said feelingly. "Oh there is so much to do." She made to stand but was stopped by Kimi. "Lady Ota?"</p><p>"There's plenty of time." Kimi said. "Besides we want to talk to you about a few things."</p><p>"Ky Young Ji, for one." Nabiki said in an even tone.</p><p>"Ky?" Kodachi asked. "What about Ky?" She put her hand over her mouth. "Oh no, oh please don't tell me to stop seeing him." She said in despair. "I thought, I thought. Please."</p><p>"Told you." Kimi said to Nabiki. "Relax Kodachi, Nabs wouldn't do that." Kimi leaned back and crossed her legs. "Have you slept with him yet?"</p><p>"Lady Ota!" Kodachi exclaimed angrily. She glared at Kimi, then Kodachi dropped her eyes. "No." She said regretfully.</p><p>"Why not?" Nabiki asked. "You've never been shy before."</p><p>"It's not me, it's Ky." Kodachi replied. "He so painfully polite, I think he's afraid of offending me." Kodachi sighed. "The first man to treat me properly and he's, he's."</p><p>"A thug?" Kimi asked.</p><p>"He is not a thug." Kodachi  dropped her head. "He's not a thug." She repeated quietly.</p><p>"Did Ky tell you what required an apology?" Nabiki asked apparently ignoring the exchange.</p><p>Kodachi shook her head. "He said he failed but he hasn't told me how." Kodachi looked at Nabiki. "I think he meant he failed," Kodachi paused. "You."</p><p>Nabiki extracted a card from her bra. "I want you to go here." She said. "I want you to understand exactly how Ky failed me." Nabiki sat back and tapped her lip. "I agree he is not a thug. Whether he can become what I hope he will become may rest with you."</p><p>Kodachi picked up her teacup and sipped. "With me?" She asked.</p><p>"Go to that address, this afternoon." Nabiki ordered.</p><p>"Yes Lady Tendo." Kodachi replied. "May I bring someone with me?"</p><p>"Konatsu?" Asked Nabiki. Kodachi nodded. "That might be a good idea." Nabiki conceded. "Go ahead."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Is this the right place?" Kodachi asked Konatsu. She looked around. This was certainly the poorest neighborhood Kodachi had even been in. She didn't even know such places existed. She knew there was poverty but it was an academic knowledge. It wasn't dirty even the poorest of Japanese were neat, but it was neglected badly. And the number of people living in the area staggered Kodachi. "How can people live like this?" She whispered.<p>"Sometimes they have no choice girlfriend." Koatsu said grimly. "I should know."</p><p>"Aiyah, I not think even China have so much poor." Ting Li added. To Kodachi's surprise when she had visited Konatsu she found Ting Li already there. When Kodachi explained what she had to do Ting Li insisted that she come. "I want see." She had said. Though what she wanted to see she wouldn't explain.</p><p>The trio approached the apartment building that matched the address. There once was a system that allowed a visitor to ring a particular apartment. What was left was barely more than a space that once housed the electronics. The door to the building after a minor bit of resistence swung open. The building was a discordant medly of smells, music and screaming children.</p><p>"What is that smell?" Kodachi said in disgust.</p><p>"Urine." Konatsu replied. "Someone has used the hallway as a toilet." Konatsu looked around as he stepped carefully down the hall. "Often."</p><p>"Why doesn't the landlord do something?' Kodachi asked, shocked.</p><p>"Why should he?' Konatsu replied. "These people are trash. The lowest of the low. They should be happy they have a roof over their heads." The way Konatsu said it, it sounded like he was repeating something he had heard. His next words confirmed it. "At least that's what I hear on the radio."</p><p>Kodachi walked down the hallway in thought. 'My brother was right, I know nothing.' She thought sadly. She looked at the doors passing by. She stopped. "This is where I'm supposed to be." She told her companions. Kodachi knocked. The door was opened by a little girl of four or five. 'Hello." Kodachi said in soothing tones. "Is there a Koko Kobiashi here?"</p><p>The little girl looked at Kodachi for a moment. "Mommy!" The little girl yelled. "Someone at the door."</p><p>A woman ran out from the back of the apartment. "Kiko!" Scolded the woman. "What did I say about yelling?" She bowed to Kodachi and the guests. "Please excuse my daughter."</p><p>"It's alright." Kodachi said. "Little girls can be," Kodachi trailed off. The woman once was pretty but a long scar that stretched from her upper lip to just below her eye marred her features. Kodachi blanched when the woman made to cover the scar forcing Kodachi to realize she was staring. "Please excuse me." Kodachi bowed. "I am being rude."</p><p>The woman waved off the apology. "It's okay, I'm getting used to it." She said. She smiled slightly. "Sometimes I even forget." She looked at Kodachi curiously. "Can I help you?"</p><p>"Are you?" Kodachi licked dry lips. "Are you Koko Kobiashi?" She bowed again when the woman nodded warily. "Forgive me for intruding but I was told to come see you."</p><p>Koko's eyes narrowed in surprise. "Told?" she asked. "By who?" She looked at Kodachi and then Ting Li and Konatsu. "Are you from Social Services?"</p><p>Kodachi noticed how the woman stepped protectively in front of the little girl as she asked the question. Kodachi shook her head. "No. No." She said reassuringly. "Forgive me, I don't even know why the Lady Tendo sent me to see you." She looked at the woman's face. She swallowed nervously. "Or maybe I do."</p><p>"Lady Tendo?" Asked Koko. "I don't know a, oh," She said in sudden understanding. "The Ice Queen." She sighed in relief when Kodachi nodded. She stepped aside. "Please come in."</p><p>"Thank you." Kodachi said. She entered the apartment and removed her shoes. There wasn't, she noticed, a spare pair of house slippers. She hesitated then walked into the apartment in her stocking feet followed by Konatsu and Ting Li. Kodachi looked around. While the outside of the apartment was virtually a disaster, inside the apartment it was neat and clean. the furnishings though inexpensive were well cared for and, Kodachi noted, someone had taken the time to arrange the meager furnishings in a harmonious manner.</p><p>Koko waved Kodachi, Ting Li and Konatsu to a old but well cared for couch. "Please sit." she said. "I'll make some tea."</p><p>"Let me girlfriend." Konatsu jumped up. Before Koko could protest, Konatsu was in the kitchen.</p><p>Koko shrugged. "I hope the Ice Queen didn't send you with more money." Koko said after a moment. "She's been too generous as it is." Koko looked at her daughter. "Kiko why don't you go to your room. Mommy wants to talk." The little girl nodded and hurried away.</p><p>"No. No money." Kodachi replied. "I think, forgive me, but I think the Lady," Kodachi paused. "I think the Ice Queen wanted me to see your face." She swallowed. "It's very recent." She said. "Though whoever treated you was very skilled."</p><p>Koko nodded. "The Ice Queen's personal physician." She smiled. "Gods was he handsome." Her smile widened and Kodachi could see how the scar distorted the smile. "I'm not sure but I think the doctor's girlfriend is related to the Ice Queen. They were so alike."</p><p>"I see." Kodachi looked up as the door to the kitchen opened and Konatsu came out with a tea service. When Konatsu placed the tea service on the small table, Kodachi took over pouring tea. The tea was of an inferior quality, as was everything in the apartment, but Kodachi sipped the tea as if it were the finest grown. "Forgive me again." Kodachi said. "But please can you tell me what happened?" She waved a hand at the woman's face.</p><p>Koko's pallor paled and then ,to Kodachi's surprise, became one of satisfaction. "Toshio didn't believe the Ice Queen." She shrugged. "To be honest, neither did I, but she meant it." She said fiercely. "She meant it."</p><p>"Toshio man who cut face." Ting Li said in explanation.</p><p>"You know Toshio ?" Koko asked in surprise. "Were you one of his girls?"</p><p>Ting Li snorted. "He try make me so, he learn better." Ting Li growled. "If I want pimp I find someone better than him."</p><p>"Pimp." Gasped Kodachi. She looked at Koko. She bowed. "Forgive me." She said. "I have much to learn." Kodachi looked down. "Please excuse me if I offend but the Ice Queen sent me here to learn of Ky Young Ji's crime and instead I am learning of; forgive me, what was his name?"</p><p>"Toshio Wasuhara." Supplied Ting Li. "But Toshio is why Ky Young Ji apologize. Toshio was pimp for Ky Young Ji."</p><p>Kodachi nodded as if something had been confirmed. "I see."</p><p>"I hope this Ky Young Ji paid." Snarled Koko. She pointed to her face. "Toshio did this; if he worked for Ky Young Ji then he's responsible too."</p><p>Kodachi chewed her lip. "He knows that." She said quietly. "The Ice Queen held him personally responsible." She looked at Koko with a fierce expression. "He paid Mrs. Kobiashi, he paid."</p><p>"Good." Koko said in satisfaction. "Whoever took over is a hell of a lot better. At least that's what the other girls say."</p><p>A brief smile appeared on Kodachi's face. "No one took his place. The Ice Queen forgave him. She even seems pleased with him."</p><p>"Really?" Koko chuckled. "Whatever the Ice Queen did to him must have been pure evil." She said with positive glee.</p><p>"It was Mrs. Kobiashi." Kodachi replied. "She gave him a second chance."</p><p>Koko snorted. "About time there was a strong woman willing to fight for us." She said in approval. "You're not a working girl are you?"</p><p>A brief smile again appeared on Kodachi's lips. "Not a professional, no." She replied.</p><p>"But she be real, real popular if she were." Ting Li said innocently.</p><p>"You are so bad girlfriend." Konatsu laughed. "Though you're probably right." Even Kodachi joined in on the laughter that followed. "If you don't mind me asking," He looked around. "Where's the girl's father?"</p><p>"Who knows and who cares?" Koko replied. "Bum ran out and left me with a two year old girl and a lot of bills." She waved a hand. "Took me a couple years but I was just about to move out before," Her hand went to her face. "Before this."</p><p>"Doctor Ono did an excellent job." Kodachi said in approval. "The scarring could have been much, much worse." She tapped her lower lip. "I can't do anything about the mouth but," She trailed off. Kodachi pulled out a cell phone and pressed a couple of buttons. "Sasuke. I need my cosmetics kit." She hung up.</p><p>"I've tried makeup." Koko said when she recovered from her surprise. She stopped at Kodachi's raised hand.</p><p>"I'm sure you have." Kodachi said. "Please let me try." She urged. "At the very worst, you can try some very, very expensive makeup."</p><p>"Sounds like fun to me." Konatsu said. "I could do with a makeover." She looked at Koko. "What do you say?"</p><p>"Oh, you don't know the last time I just hung out with my girlfriends." Koko said. "I'll make a deal, you do my face and I'll do your hair." She preened. "I'll have you know my old customers, before, well they used to think I was pretty good."</p><p>"Oh you do hair?" Kodachi said. "Well I expect to see my," She smiled. "Beau, I believe you could call him." She looked down for a moment. "Well I expect to see him this evening." She looked at Koko again. "Deal." To Kodachi's surprise Koko hugged her.</p><p>"Thank you." Koko said in a voice heavy with emotion. She hugged Konatsu and Ting Li. "I really, really needed some company." There was a knock on the door. "My today is a day for company."</p><p>Kodachi rose. "Let me." She said. "It's probably Sasuke." Kodachi strode to the door and opened it. She frowned when instead of her brother's ninja there were three very burly and dangerous looking men at the door. Before she could say anything the three men barreled into the room. Kodachi was pushed roughly against the wall.</p><p>"Shut up bitch. We're not here for you." One man growled. He made to slap Kodachi and, to his surprise, his blow was blocked. "That was a mistake." He snarled. "Now I'm gonna have to hurt you." Sounds of battle came from the main room. He fist pulled back.</p><p>Kodachi rolled her eyes and kicked the thug in the groin. He fell to the floor groaning. "Alright." Kodachi snapped. "Who are you working for?" The main continued to groan. "Oh I didn't hit you that hard." She said in annoyance. "Oh well." Kodachi reached down and grabbed the man by the collar and started to drag him into the apartment. She kicked the door closed with her foot. She tossed the man she was dragging on to the mound of the other two thugs bodies. Konatsu was busy comforting Koko while Ting Li stood guard over the men. "Oh dear, was Koko hurt?"</p><p>"Just frightened." Konatsu replied. She looked at Koko. "I know you're frightened girl, but this is very important. Do you know any of these men?"</p><p>Koko peered nervously at the men from the shelter of Konatsu's shoulder. She shook her head. "I'm not sure." She said finally. "No wait." She pointed. "I think I saw him with Toshio once."</p><p>"Someone not learn lesson." Ting Li sang softly. "Hey Konatsu, what you doing this evening?" Konatsu laughed. Before she could say anything there was another knock at the door.</p><p>"That had better be Sasuke." Kodachi said warningly. She strode to the door again. She pulled the door open. The diminuative ninja stood at the door.</p><p>"I have your cosmetics case, Mistress." Sasuke said proudly. "What?" He said in surprise as he was pulled into the apartment.</p><p>Kodachi pointed at the pile of men on the floor. "Remove those." She ordered.</p><p>"At once mistress." Sasuke eyed the men then shrugged and somehow managed to get all three hoisted on his back. "I will advise my lord Tatewaki."</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "Do that." She pulled out her cell phone and punched another number. "Hello Ky?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ky Young Ji parked his sportscar in front of the apartment building. As he exited the car he saw Kodachi running toward him. To his surprise she jumped into his arms. "Kodachi? What?"<p>"Oh just kiss me." Kodachi said huskily. Her mouth reached hungrily for his as their lips met. The kiss was long and when it finally ended Kodachi rested her head on Ky's shoulder. She smiled when Ky kissed the top of her head. Kodachi looked up. "We must talk." Kodachi said seriously. She took Ky's arm and led him toward the apartment building.</p><p>"What are you doing here?' Ky said as he looked around.</p><p>"Do you know who Koko Kobiashi is?" Kodachi asked quietly.</p><p>Ky blanched. "How do you know that name?' He asked. "The Ice Queen." He answered his own question.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "Did you know she lives here?"</p><p>"I've never been here." Ky replied. "I never met the woman."</p><p>Kodachi stopped and looked at Ky Young Ji in surprise. "You never met her?" She reached for Ky's left hand. "You did this for someone you never even met?"</p><p>"For a principle." Ky corrected. "principles are important." He scratched at his head. "The Ice Queen was right about that."</p><p>"I see." Kodachi resumed the walk to the apartment. "There is a viper in your midst Ky." Kodachi said coldly. "You will remove it."</p><p>Ky blinked at the sudden change in Kodachi's demeanor. "Excuse me?"</p><p>"Toshio Wasuhara just tried to have Koko killed." Kodachi said angrily. "I will not stand for that."</p><p>"What do you want me to do?" Ky asked quietly. 'Gods she magnificient when she's like this.' He thought.</p><p>"Whatever is necessary." Kodachi replied. "Lady Tendo cannot object to what is necessary." Kodachi said quickly. "Nor will I." She added softly. She turned to Ky. "If we were not there she'd be dead right now." Kodachi said. "She has a little girl Ky. I shudder to think what her fate might have been."</p><p>Kodachi led Ky into the apartment building. Ky was surprised to see Ting Li and Konatsu. He didn't know them, though he knew of them. The first thing Ky did was walk over to Koko and bow. "Good afternoon Mrs. Kobiashi." Ky said formally. "Please accept my apologies for all that you have suffered. It will be dealt with."</p><p>"Who are you?" Koko asked curiously.</p><p>"Always introduce yourself first." Kodachi said with a touch of exasperation. "At least he tries." She added as an aside to Koko. "Koko this is Ky Young Ji, trusted associate to the Ice Queen."</p><p>"He's the boyfriend." Konatsu said in an aside.</p><p>"Really?" She asked Konatsu. "I see." She looked at Ky Young Ji for a moment then looked at Kodachi. "I see." She said again. "What are you going to do?" She asked Ky.</p><p>"Whatever is necessary." Ky replied. "I," He looked at Kodachi. A smile came to his lips. "My Lady demands it."</p><p>"Ky." Kodachi protested in a flustered voice. "You can't, I haven't, I mean." She swallowed. "We'll talk later." She  wrapped herself in her remaining composure like a cloak "In the meantime, I promised Koko a makeover."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ky Young Ji walked to the door of the Kuno Library and knocked before entering. He saw that Nabiki was sitting at her desk reading a report, Kimi was sitting next to her and explaining some point. To his surprise Tatewaki was not present. He walked to the desk and bowed respectfully. "You wanted to see me Ice Queen?"<p>Nabiki looked up. "Exactly what did you think you were doing?" She asked in her iciest tones. "I did not order any operation." She picked up a piece of paper. "According to this, you led a half dozen of your men along with Konatsu, Ting Li and," She shook her head. "Kodachi Kuno against a group associated with Toshio Wasuhara." She leaned back. "Care to explain."</p><p>"Toshio sent some of his," A slight sneer came to Ky's face. "Associates against Koko Kobiashi in retribution. I thought it best to answer the insult to you immediately."</p><p>"Insult to me?" Nabiki asked. "Or to Kodachi?"</p><p>"Kodachi was angry not insulted." Ky Young Ji replied calmly. He was about to say something more when the door to the library slammed open. Kodachi came in striding with anger written all over her face.</p><p>"I cannot believe you would take Ky to task for doing what you've claimed is your goal." She said as she advanced. "He deserves nothing less than your praise."</p><p>"You forget yourself." Nabiki said icily.</p><p>"No I remember myself." Kodachi shot back. "take whatever anger you wish out on me, I deserve it, but do not dare to punish someone whose sole crime was to uphold the principles you claim to follow." She growled. "Or if you cannot then whatever punishment you give to Ky must go to me as well."</p><p>"Sister." Tatewaki said from behind. "Be careful what you ask for." He said seriously. "You may get it." Tatewaki paused in the doorway.</p><p>"So be it." Kodachi said without taking her eyes off of Nabiki. "I will stand with him on this."</p><p>Nabiki leaned back in her chair. "Well, well. Who would have thought it?" She said in wry amusement. She looked at Kimi. "It seems I am being hoisted on my own petard." She said to the other woman. "If I punish them I send exactly the wrong signal." Nabiki chuckled. "And I can't have that, can I?"</p><p>"Nope." Kimi agreed with her own knowing smile. She looked at Kodachi and Ky. "who would have thought it?" She said musingly. "Next time get permission first." She said a moment later with a touch of heat in her voice.</p><p>Ky and Kodachi looked at each other. Kodachi gave Ky a slight nod. Ky Young Ji turned to Nabiki and Kimi. "For that, we apologize." He said. "It will not happen again."</p><p>"See that it doesn't." Nabiki replied. She waved a hand. "You can leave now."</p><p>Ky Young Ji and Kodachi bowed almost in unison to Nabiki and Kimi. Then they turned on their heels and strode out of the Library. As they passed Tatewaki, Tatewaki gave both of them a short bow. Tatewaki watched as they walked away then walked over to Nabiki and Kimi. He rested a hip on the desk. "It seems you were right." He said softly. "About both of them." Tatewaki looked at the closed library door. "Bravo Sister, bravo."</p><p>"I'm still pissed at her." Nabiki grumbled.</p><p>"As you should be My lady." Tatewaki replied. "But gods she makes me proud to be a Kuno."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The bell over the door to Noguchi Hata's corner convenience store rang. He looked up and got slowly to his feet. He was an old man and had run this store for most of his adult life. Old he may have been but not so old that the sight of three very pretty and very familar faces didn't bring a slightly hungry look to his face. "Ah if I were only forty years younger." He said in a slight moan. "Good evening girls."<p>"Hey Mr. Hata." The smallest and in Noguchi's opinion the prettiest of the three said.</p><p>"Hey Usagi." Noguchi said. He leaned forward and to his pleasure was kissed, on the cheek maybe, but kissed anyway by the little redhead. "Let me guess, you ran out of ice cream."</p><p>"Got it in one, Mr. Hata." The tallest of the three said. "We thought we'd pick up a few things while we were here." She looked around. "Everything okay?" She asked. The bell over the door rang and a man walked in. She smiled as the man obviously pretended to shop.</p><p>"Everything's been fine Sugoi." Old man Hata said. His smile widened as another customer entered the store. 'Never fails.' He thought cheerfully. "Hi Jiro." He said to one of the customers. In minutes the store was pleasantly busy. The third member of the trio, the blue haired Aoi, perched herself on the counter and flirted with the customers. 'If this keeps up I'll make as much today as I do in a week.' He thought happily. He looked to the window of his store. A number of men had their faces pressed to it. In the corner was taped very carefully a flier to the Kabuki club.</p><p>Aoi hopped off the counter as Usagi and Sugoi approached. "Can you put this one our tab?" Aoi said in her baby voice. "You're so sweet." Aoi said when old man Hata nodded. She crooked her finger and the old man leaned forward. Aoi, then Usagi and finally Sugoi all kissed the old man. The three walked out of the store waving to all their admirers as they left.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo walked down the street. Much to Akane's outward annoyance and inward admiration, Ranma juggled the groceries with a casual skill she knew she'd never acquire. Akane smiled slightly. 'I think I actually feel good today.' She marveled inwardly. She gave a momentary glance heavenward. 'Thanks.' She thought.</p><p>It didn't take all that long, Hata's store wasn't really far from their apartment, before they were putting away their groceries. They had just finished when Ting Li walked in. Ting Li walked into the kitchen and sat down at the kitchen table. "I moving out." She announced. She raised a hand. "You guys fun but you make too much noise." She grinned at the chuckle that erupted. "I move in with Konatsu."</p><p>"Actually that wouldn't be a bad idea." Akane said. "And not because we want to get rid of you." Akane smiled. "You can keep an eye on things in Nerima for us."</p><p>"Keep an eye on my Mom while you're at it." Ranma added.</p><p>"You no worry Ranma." Ting Li said seriously. "I watch." She looked at Ukyo. "Sorry see me go?"</p><p>"A little." Ukyo admitted. "Okay a lot." She spread her hands helplessly. "Visit, okay? Often."</p><p>"I will." Ting Li promised. She quickly found herself in a group hug. "Thank you." She said feelingly. "For everything."</p><p>"You gonna work in Uk-chan's with Konatsu?" Ranma asked a little later. The four of them were sitting down to dinner. Ukyo had made several of Ting Li's favorite dishes as a going away present.</p><p>Ting Li shook her head. "Oh no." She replied with a laugh. "I find club in Nerima." She declared. "Money too-too good as dancer."</p><p>"That's true." Ukyo conceded.</p><p>"Tell us what club you're working at. We'll come for a visit." Akane said. "Actually tell Nabs too." She amended. "She's going to count on you to make sure the girls are treated right."</p><p>Ting Li nodded. "I do that." She said.</p><p>"That doesn't mean you take on someone without backup." Ranma said seriously. "If some asshole needs talking to you take Konatsu, at least, with you." He scratched the back of his head. "Also train with Pops and old man Tendo." He said. "They may be old but that got some good moves and a lot of experience."</p><p>Ting Li nodded again. "I do that." She repeated.</p><p>"And stop fucking Ryoga." Akane said.</p><p>"I do tha, hey!" Ting Li blushed. Then she grinned. "You going tell Konatsu same thing?"</p><p>"He didn't." Ranma said in disbelief.</p><p>"Bweee." Ting Li said in imitation.</p><p>Akane's chair fell over and she landed on her back on the floor. She rolled around the floor in uncontrolled laughter. "Oh gods." She gasped as she pulled herself to her knees. She wrapped her arms around her waist. "Oh gods." She gasped again. "That, oh, that." Akane took a breath. "Bwee?" She said questioningly.</p><p>"No more like," Ting Li took a breath. "BWeeeEEEeeEEEEE." She broke up in laughter. Akane fell back to the floor doubled up in her own laughter.</p><p>"And where were you at the time?' Ranma asked in innocent tones when the laughter quieted down.</p><p>Ting Li wiggled in her seat. "Where you think?" She asked with a satisfied grin. "Made Ryoga wiggle real good." She leaned forward. "I think he like it." She said conspiritoraly. "Course." She said confidently. "He not get me if he not take Konatsu in bargain."</p><p>"Oh I am so going to rub it in his face." Ukyo said in cold glee. "Arrogant, macho, chauvinistic Pig." She growled. "Bastard actually turned me down." She said angrily. "Said I wasn't feminine enough." She looked down. "Actually he said I looked too much like a guy."</p><p>"When did you proposition Ryoga?" Ranma asked in a strange tone. It took Ukyo and Akane to recognize it. Ranma was jealous. Angry jealous.</p><p>"When you picked Akane. I was trying to give you up, remember?" Ukyo said. "It was stupid, I know, but who else would it have been?"</p><p>"She's got a point Ranma." Akane said easily. "Get over it." She looked at Ukyo. "So that's why you're so pissed at Ryoga." She shrugged. "Still interested in him?"</p><p>"Not anymore." Ukyo said feelingly. She looked at Ting Li. "You can have him."</p><p>Ting Li smiled. "Thank you, I will." She chirped.</p><p>"Still gonna pound him when I see him again." Muttered Ranma crossly. "No one insults Uk-chan like that."</p><p>"You got that right." Akane smiled. "I'll help."</p><p>"Good." Ranma replied.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Well hello Gos." Nabiki said in slightly sarcastic tones. "Good of you to," Nabiki paused for a second then smiled. "Show yourself." Nabiki leaned back in her chair and reached out her hand. Kimi placed a folder in Nabiki's outstretched hand. Nabiki leaned forward and placed the folder in front of Hikaru Gosenkugi.<p>Hikaru Gosunkugi , Gos to those who knew him, hadn't changed since high school. Or rather he had become more Gos. If anything his pallor was even paler. His cheeks and eyes more cadaverous. He seemed more dead than alive. Until you looked into his eyes. The fire of the zealot burned there. Though it was not a god or gods that Gos owed his allegience, it was what was in the folder. Pictures. Information. Gos had learned that people would pay him to learn things or, just as often, not letting other's know what he learned.</p><p>"I thought it safe enough." Gos said in surprisingly deep and cadaverous tones.</p><p>Nabiki waited. She smiled slightly when Gos remained silent. "You do very good work." She said. "I like the way you," She smiled. "Capture the participants in such candid poses. Almost as if you weren't there."She tilted her head. "So what is it; magic, some version of the umisenken, a psychic power?"</p><p>An almost smile appeared on Gos face. "I seem to be," Gos paused. "Easy to ignore." He said in tones that seemed to evoke the grave.</p><p>"Yes." Nabiki said quietly. "That does seem to be the case."</p><p>"I seem to have to keep telling myself you're in the room with us." Kimi said in suspicious tones. "You're so damn quiet." She added. "You don't fidget. You do nothing to draw attention to yourself."</p><p>Though it was hard to tell, Gos smile got wider. "You'd be surprised." He said gravely.</p><p>Nabiki stared down her nose at Gos. "Maybe not." Nabiki replied. 'I think whatever he is doing is enough like the Umisenken that Ranma should be able to figure out how to find him.' She kept her face impassive as she thought. 'He knows I won't kill him. Damn it.' Nabiki thought in annoyance. 'He might have been wandering around here for days, even weeks.' Nabiki leaned forward. "What do you want Gos?" She asked. "No check that." She said suddenly. "What do you have to sell?"</p><p>This time it was obvious that Gos' was smiling. "Many things." He said. It seemed to Nabiki that Gos became somehow more solid. "For example." He reached slowly into his suit jacket pocket. Like Gosunkugi, the jacket was nondescript and easily forgettable. "An old friend of yours is back in town." He placed a picture in front of Nabiki. "This one is for free."</p><p>Nabiki looked down at the picture. Her sudden inward breath was a hiss. "Hikaru." She said in anger and a touch of fear. "How old is this picture?" She asked without looking up.</p><p>"Thursday." Gos replied in hollow tones. It was Saturday.</p><p>"Thank you." Nabiki gave Gos a short bow of her head."I am having an engagement party." Nabiki said casually.</p><p>"I know." Gos replied. He seemed to get less easy to see. Or rather it was getting harder to, as Kimi put it, remember he was there. "I would be honored to do the official portraits."</p><p>Nabiki forced herself to remember that Gos was sitting in front of her. "Excellent." She rose. "I will escort you out." She said firmly. "It's the least I can do." She looked at Gos. 'He's definitely not a Chi adept.' She thought. 'Or not the kind I've seen.' She amended to herself. She shook her head. When she stopped she realized Gos was gone. "Damn." She exclaimed angrily. "He's probably standing right next to me." She muttered. With a sigh Nabiki walked to the door of the office, opened the door and stood back, she seemed to count to ten and then closed the door.</p><p>"Think he's gone?" Kimi asked. She looked around nervously.</p><p>"I think so." Nabiki replied. "I hope so." She pinched the bridge of her nose. "Great, just great." She said in exasperation. "Another loose cannon." She griped. "And Hikaru is back in town." She picked up the picture on the desk. "He's alone in the picture." She said. "But he has connections, he won't be alone for long."</p><p>"He's taking a gamble coming here." Kimi said thoughtfully. "And I don't like the timing."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Yeah." She said in firm agreement. she grimaced suddenly. "You don't think he's be stupid enough to try attacking us at the ball, do you?"</p><p>"Definitely dramatic enough for Hikaru." Kimi shrugged. "We know he's here, we can prepare." She said. "He is not going to mess things up." She said in no nonsence tones. "I think we should actively look for him." Kimi said.</p><p>"I think you're right." Nabiki agreed. "As you wish, My Lady Kimi." She bowed her head</p><p>"Why thank you," Kimi returned the bow. "My Lady Nabiki." She smiled slightly. "You know, I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this."</p><p>"You were born with it Baby." Nabiki smiled. "I knew it the day we met."</p><p>End Chapter 8</p><p>Author's Notes: Well things are starting to heat up, lots of surprises coming up. Oh by the way, the Ting Li/Konatsu team up is based on an actual couple I knew. He was gay, she was straight and very attractive. They used to play a sort of sexual 'bait and switch' game. As far as I know, no one ever complained.</p>
