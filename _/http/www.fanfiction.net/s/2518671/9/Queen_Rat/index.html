</div><p>Chapter 9</p><p>'Recovery'</p><p>Ukyo opened her eyes to see Ranma looking down at her. Ukyo tried to talk but only a croak came out of her dry throat. Ranma placed a straw against Ukyo's lips. The chef drank thirstily.</p><p>"You're going to be okay Uk-chan." Ranma said in a broken voice. "Doc Tofu said so." Ranma took Ukyo's hand. "Will you please stop scaring me like that."</p><p>"I'll try." Ukyo rasped out. She looked around groggily. "Where?"</p><p>"You're in the prison infirmary." Ranma replied. "The doc took the bullet out. You're going to be okay." Ukyo nodded. "Get some rest Uk-chan." Ranma said. "I'll be back later." Ukyo nodded again. Ranma walked out of the infirmary. A number of prison guards immediately surrounded her. One approached with a set of manacles.</p><p>"That will not be necessary." Warden Kenichi ordered. "Just take her back to her cell." The warden turned to the stocky woman standing next to her. "See that she gets there without theatrics, Yasuhara."</p><p>"Yes sir." Sargent Yasuhara replied. "Come along Ranko." She leaned closer as they walked. "Don't worry, your Father and Mr. Tendo will watch over her." Ranma nodded but didn't say anything..</p><p>They reached Ranma's cell. Ranma turned to Yasuhara. The older woman flinched upon seeing the redhead's expression. "They hurt my friend." Ranma said in a voice pitched for Yasuhara's ears alone. "No one hurts my friends." She walked into her cell.</p><p>Akane was sitting on the bunk. She looked up when Ranma walked in. "How is she?" Akane asked in concern.</p><p>"She'll live." Ranma rasped. "Our Dads are with her." She sat down on the bunk. "Someone is going to pay for this." She looked at Akane. "You with me?"</p><p>"Do you have to ask?" Akane replied fiercely. "It's personal now." Ranma nodded. "Rest now Ranma." Akane said. "You've been up all night." She pushed Ranma down on to the bunk. "Rest." Ranma nodded and curled up in the bunk. "I'm going to talk to Nabiki."</p><p>Akane stood and walked to the cell door and opened it. The two guards standing there immediately raised their batons. "Don't even think it." Akane growled. "I'm going to see my sister." She pushed passed the two guards and went to the next cell and opened it. Nabiki and Kimi looked up from the lower bunk. They were wrapped in each others arms and naked.</p><p>"You ever hear of knocking?" Nabiki grumped.</p><p>"Put some clothes on, we need to talk." Akane snapped. "You can fool around later." She sat in one of the chairs. Akane waited impatiently as her sister and Kimi got dressed. "Hurry up."</p><p>"Okay. Okay." Kimi and Nabiki shot back. Finally they dressed. Nabiki sat in the other chair while Kimi stood just behind Nabiki. "I've seen that look." Nabiki said. She looked up at Kimi. "Kimi if you stay here right now, you're going to cross a line."</p><p>"It's already been crossed Nabs." Kimi said calmly.</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "How's Ukyo?" She asked.</p><p>"Ranma says she'll live." Akane replied. "Daddy and Mr. Saotome are with her. As guards."</p><p>Nabiki nodded again. "Where's Ranma?" She asked.</p><p>"Resting." Akane returned shortly. "Right now he's on a very short fuse. I'll try to keep him calm if I can, in the meantime."</p><p>"In the meantime we need to find him the right target. Right?" Nabiki asked. Akane nodded. "Everyone we know who was involved has been put in custody."</p><p>"Here?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Here." Nabiki crossed her legs. "They're in the hole. The warden is keeping their arrest quiet."</p><p>"They say anything yet?" Akane cracked her knuckles when Nabiki shook her head.</p><p>"Kimi, have I ever told you how persuasive my baby sister can be?" Nabiki smiled coldly. "I'll see if the warden will let you and Ranma talk to them." Akane's smile matched Nabiki's. "Just don't kill them." Nabiki added.</p><p>"I don't plan to." Akane replied. "But I can't speak for Ranma." Akane expression was cloudy. "I haven't seen him this angry since China."</p><p>"Do your best." Nabiki leaned back in her chair. "How are you holding up?"</p><p>"I'll live." Akane stood. "I better get back to Ranma." She walked to the door. When she got there she paused and looked back at Nabiki and Kimi. "Find something and soon Sis. Ranma won't stay patient for long. Neither will I." She opened the door and walked out.</p><p>Kimi watched Akane leave. "Anyone ever tell you your sister can be very scary?" Kimi shook her head. "All you Tendos are scarey."</p><p>"Even me?" Nabiki asked in amusement.</p><p>"Nabs, you're the scariest one of the bunch." Kimi replied. She wrapped her arms around Nabiki's shoulders. "Good thing I like tough women."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Warden Kenichi walked into his office to find it already occupied. Two men he recognized as Soun Tendo and Genma Saotome were sitting in a corner playing Shogi. Even as he watched he could see the two were both cheating outrageously. Sitting at his desk, knitting, was a very attractive young woman. 'Oh yes the elder sister Kasumi.' Sitting in a chair next to the desk, reading a book, was a very attractive older woman that he recognized as Nodoka Saotome. "Excuse me but why are you people still here and why are you in my office?' He asked in a tight voice. "I thought you left?"<p>"We did." Said Nodoka Saotome. "We came back." She put a book mark in the book to hold her place and put the book on the desk. "Don't blame your guards, Genma and Soun can be very persuasive when they want to be."</p><p>Soun looked up from the game board. "Why thank you Nodoka." Genma grunted. Soun looked back down at the board. "Hmm. It appears I've lost. Another game?" Genma started to reset the game pieces.</p><p>"I don't think you people understand what's going on here." The warden said in a tightly controlled voice. "This is not a hotel. This is a prison." He said. "There are some very dangerous people in here."</p><p>"Oh my." Said Kasumi without looking up from her knitting. "How exciting." Kasumi finished a row. She looked at the warden. "Don't worry Ranma and Akane will protect you."</p><p>The warden stopped short of pulling out his hair. "It's not me I'm worried about." He began.</p><p>"You're not married are you? I can always tell." Nodoka interrupted. "I have a couple friends who would find you very interesting. I'll introduce you if you'd like."</p><p>"Mrs. Saotome." Began the warden.</p><p>"Please. You must call me Nodoka." Nodoka replied. She walked to a sideboard. "Tea?"</p><p>"What is wrong with you people?' The warden exploded. "This. Is. A. Prison."</p><p>"And a very nice one." Replied Nodoka. She carried a tea cup over to the warden. "You must be so proud." She guided the warden over to a small sofa. "Now please sit." Warden Kenichi opened his mouth to protest. Thought better of it and sat. "Wonderful." Said Nodoka.</p><p>The door to the warden's office opened and Sargent Yasuhara walked in. "I have the reports you," Yasuhara's voice trailed off. "How did you get back in here?"</p><p>"Kiki!" Chorused Soun and Genma. The two men stood up and greeted the startled Sargent warmly. "We didn't get a chance to talk before. Ranma tells me you're doing very well." Added Soun.</p><p>"Who's Ranma?" Asked the warden in a faint voice.</p><p>"Ranma Saotome. My son." Nodoka answered. "But you probably know him better as Ranko Tendo."</p><p>"Him? Ranko?" The warden sipped his tea nervously. "Your. Son." The warden took another sip of his tea. "You mean it's true?" He said in a stunned voice. "I thought my friend was joking."</p><p>The door to the warden's office opened again and two burly female guards walked in carrying some rolled up futons. "Oh excellent." Said Nodoka. "Just put them over there." She pointed to a corner.</p><p>"What is going on?" The warden's voice cracked.</p><p>"Soun and Genma will be staying here until it's safe to move Ukyo" She smiled warmly at the warden. "Don't worry, you'll barely know they're here."</p><p>The door to the warden's office opened yet again. This time Dr. Tofu walked in. "Hello everyone." He said. "I just checked on Ukyo. She's doing very well. Three, four days at the most and we can move her."</p><p>"Wonderful news." Enthused Nodoka. "See warden, they'll be gone before you know it."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The 'hole' was in the lowest part of the prison, actually in the sub-basement. The 'hole' was a series of small cells. Each cell measured two meters by two meters and consisted of nothing more than a futon and a toilet. One prisoner per cell. Except for two meals a day, each prisoner was totally isolated. Mariko Tanaka had been in the hole for two days now and it was starting to get to her. The door to her cell suddenly opened.<p>"Hey it's about time." She snarled. Mariko Tanaka jumped to her feet. "I want to speak to my lawyer."</p><p>"Did you hear something Ranma?' A short, but extremely powerfully built brunette asked the other woman who came into the cell with her, a petite redhead.</p><p>"Hearing ghosts, Akane?" The redhead replied. She looked directly at Mariko. "You know this cell is empty."</p><p>Akane gave Mariko a cold look. "You're right. This cell is empty."</p><p>"Hey, what's the big, oof." Mariko's protest was cut off when Akane slammed her fist into her stomach.</p><p>Akane picked Mariko off the floor. "As far as anyone knows, no one is in this cell." Akane said conversationally. "You could disappear and no one would ever know." Akane slammed her fist into Mariko's stomach a second time. Akane picked Mariko off the floor again. "That was just to show you we're serious." Akane threw Mariko onto the futon. "Of course, if we start hearing what we want to hear, maybe, just maybe, you'll live to complain about it."</p><p>Mariko wrapped her arms around her stomach. "You. You can't scare me." She gasped.</p><p>"Can't scare you huh?" Akane smiled coldly. "I want you to look at my friend over there." Akane jerked a thumb toward Ranma. "Show her, Ranma." Ranma turned and punched at the cell door. When she pulled her hand away, Mariko could see a fist sized dent in the heavy steel. "The only thing keeping her from ripping your arms off and beating you to death with them," Akane's smile was glacial. "Is me."</p><p>"Maybe you should leave Akane." Ranma said.</p><p>"Maybe I should." Akane started walking toward the cell door.</p><p>"You can't do this." Screamed Mariko. "I have friends, important friends."</p><p>"Five minutes Ranma?" Asked Akane. She started to slide the door open. "I'll get a mop."</p><p>"Better make it ten." Ranma replied. "I want to take my time." The look she gave Mariko was one of...anticipation. The room began to get cold. A faint coating of frost started to form on everything in the room. Mariko heard the pipes begin to groan and her teeth began to chatter uncontrollably. She looked at the redhead and her breath caught in her throat. Ranma's body was glowing a menacing blue. "I'll talk. I'll talk." Mariko screamed in fear. "Just keep her away from me."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The next morning Kasumi walked into the prison infirmary. "Hello Ukyo." She said pleasantly. She pulled up a chair and sat down next to the chef. "How are you feeling today?"<p>"Like I was run over by a herd of elephants." Ukyo replied. She smiled slightly. "Which is an improvement over yesterday." Ukyo picked up a water bottle and drank from the straw to relieve her dry throat. Ukyo struggled to get into a seated position. Kasumi immediately stood and helped her. She even fluffed Ukyo's pillow. "Thanks." Ukyo leaned tiredly against the pillow. "Not that I'm complaining, but what are you still doing here?"</p><p>"Ono and I decided to stay here until it's safe to move you. Actually you could leave now, but we'd rather let you heal a little more first." She looked fondly at Ukyo. "Then we'll take you to my house. You'll stay in Akane's room until you're fully recovered." Kasumi raised a hand. "That is not open for argument. You'll be safer there."</p><p>"Good point." Ukyo admitted.</p><p>"In the meantime, Nodoka is taking care of Uk-chan's." She shook her head. "Good thing too, Konatsu was giving away free okonomiyaki."</p><p>"Again?" Ukyo rolled her eyes. "Tell Nodoka to keep a tight grip on him." She said. "And tell her thank you." Ukyo flinched slightly from the pain in her shoulder. "Damn that hurts."</p><p>"Well considering the alternative," Kasumi shook her head. "Let's not talk about that now."</p><p>Ukyo looked at the eldest Tendo girl. "You were right you know." She smiled at Kasumi's puzzled look. "About Ranma." She clarified. "Akane will be good to her. Maybe even better than me." Ukyo's mouth twisted slightly. "I would have tried though."</p><p>"I know Ukyo." Kasumi patted the younger woman's hand. "But let's not talk about that now, either. Right now, I want you to concentrate on getting better." The door to the infirmary opened and Ranma walked in. Several nervous looking guards could be seen just outside the door. Soun and Genma could be seen standing between them and the door with their backs to the room.</p><p>"Ran-chan!" Ukyo called happily.</p><p>Kasumi stood. "Well I'll leave the two of you alone." She said. Kasumi walked over to Ranma. "Don't let her exert herself too much." She told the redhead quietly. "She's still very weak."</p><p>"Don't worry Kasumi. I wont." Ranma assured her. Kasumi smiled and walked out of the infirmary. Ranma walked over to the bed and sat in the chair Kasumi had just vacated.</p><p>"Hey don't I get a kiss?" Ukyo mock complained.</p><p>"Kasumi said not to tire ya out." Ranma smiled briefly. The smile grew when Ukyo pouted. "Okay, maybe just a little kiss." She leaned over and kissed Ukyo lightly but feelingly on the lips. Ranma sat back and took Ukyo's hand. "Akane says she'll be by later. If you want."</p><p>"Tell Akane I'd be happy to see her." Ukyo replied. "You look tired."</p><p>"That's my line." Ranma smiled. "I can tell ya gonna be up and around in no time."</p><p>"You know it." Ukyo replied in a tired but cocky voice. "I hate being stuck in this bed."</p><p>"It's only for a few more days Uk-chan." Ranma pulled at her pigtail. "Kasumi told me you're gonna stay at the house. I think that's a good idea."</p><p>"Promise me something Ran-chan." Ukyo said suddenly.</p><p>"Sure Uk-chan." Ranma replied. "What?"</p><p>"Don't kill anyone." Ukyo expression became serious. "Not for me. I don't want that on my conscience." Ukyo's grim expression vanished as quickly as it appeared. "That doesn't mean I don't want you to kick the living shit out of them."</p><p>"They hurt you Uk-chan." Ranma said grimly. "I'll never forgive them for that." Ranma took a deep breath. "I'll try." She said finally. "But only cause you asked."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hello Ukyo."<p>"Akane."</p><p>The two women stared at each other. It was Akane who dropped her eyes first. "I'm really trying." She said. "With Ranma, I mean."</p><p>"I know Akane." Ukyo smiled and patted the bed. Akane walked over and sat gingerly next to the chef. Ukyo took in the expression on Akane's face. "Want to talk about it?"</p><p>"No." Akane admitted sadly. "But I think I have to." Akane sighed. "You, more than anyone, have the right to know." She said.</p><p>"Sounds serious." Ukyo said in an even tone. "How rough were you?"</p><p>Akane looked up startled. "You know?" She quickly looked back down. "Too rough." She said. "Way too rough." She looked at Ukyo. "How did you know? Did Ranma tell you?"</p><p>Ukyo shook her head. "I didn't know until just now." Ukyo gave a short laugh. "You've always been easy to read." Ukyo said. "Relax sugar. If Ranma's still talking to you, it means he's forgiven you."</p><p>"Maybe." Akane said in reluctant tones. "But will you forgive me?"</p><p>"Hey I'm the one who was responsible." Ukyo replied sharply. "I should be asking you to forgive me." Ukyo shifted uncomfortably in the bed. Then took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "Hand me that water bottle will you?" She asked. "Then tell me what happened."</p><p>Akane grabbed the bottle and handed it to Ukyo. She waited until Ukyo had her fill. "I lost my temper Ukyo." Akane sighed moodily. "I know why you did it Ukyo. And, and I can't say you were wrong. Ranma would have," Akane broke off. "We haven't tried it since." She said. "Between what happened with you and, well I'm not sure Ranma really trusts me." Akane gave a melancholy sigh. "I'm not sure I trust me."</p><p>"Oh hon." Ukyo said contritely. "I'm sorry. That wasn't what I was trying to do."</p><p>"I know." Akane interrupted. "Look just get better, okay? Wh-what happened," Akane licked her dry lips. "What happened to you is more important right now."</p><p>Ukyo shrugged in reluctant agreement.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hey Uk-chan." Ranma greeted the chef. "You're looking a lot better." Ranma walked over to the bed, leaned over and gave Ukyo a kiss. "Doc says you can go home tomorrow." Ranma sniffed. "You need a bath."<p>"Tell me about it." Ukyo complained. "I itch."</p><p>"Well, um, I could give you a sponge bath, if you want." Ranma blushed.</p><p>"Not that I'd say no, Ran-chan." Ukyo said with a big smile. "But what would Akane think?"</p><p>"Akane and I have come to an understanding." Ranma said. "About you."</p><p>Ukyo raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "You're my friend, my best friend Uk-chan." Ranma said. "Akane has accepted that."</p><p>"You guys still getting married?" Ukyo asked in concern. "Look Ranma, I don't want to come between the two of you." Ukyo said worriedly. "That wasn't what I was trying to do." Ukyo paused. 'I've been saying that a lot, haven't I?' She thought.</p><p>"I know and you won't." Ranma said firmly. "And, yeah, we still are. But not for some time yet. She and I still have some things to work out. Until then," Ranma shrugged. He smiled. "You want that sponge bath?"</p><p>"Sure Ran-chan." Ukyo smiled back. "I'd like that a lot."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki and Kimi sat in warden Kenichi's office. Warden Kenichi sat behind his desk. The warden had his office back now that Ukyo was gone. Nabiki was going through a binder. Kimi sat next to her holding a pad and pen, taking notes.<p>"The rot is deeper than we first thought." Nabiki said. She tapped the binder. "According to Tanaka, there is at least one person on the prison board involved. She didn't know who, but I think she's probably right." Nabiki leaned back. "Consider the following: there is evidence of personnel records being tampered with, evidence of questionable personnel assignments and, most importantly, the drugs themselves."</p><p>"I agree." Kenichi growled. "Who? We need to find out who."</p><p>"I'm working on it warden." Nabiki replied impatiently. "If I wasn't stuck in here I could do it a lot faster."</p><p>The warden gave Nabiki a level stare. "No doubt." He said. The warden picked up a pen and rolled it between his fingers. "Tell me." He said. "If it were possible to not be 'stuck' in here, how would you go about it?"</p><p>"Is that a hypothetical question or do you have something in mind?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"I have a friend in the Tokyo Police Department. Lt. Chikato Noriudo.." The warden said seemingly to ignore Nabiki's question. "He runs the narcotics division." The warden continued to roll the pen between his fingers. "I've already forwarded your findings to him. It appears it matches his own investigations." The warden gave Nabiki a penetrating look. "Why are you helping us?" He asked suddenly.</p><p>Nabiki opened her mouth and then closed it. "You know, I never really thought about it." She admitted. "When Yasuhara first asked, no that's not it either." Nabiki fell into a ruminative silence.</p><p>"The Tendos have an overdeveloped sense of duty." Kimi said into the silence. "Well you do Nabs." She said to Nabiki. "All of you; you, Akane, Ranko, heck even Ukyo, can't seem to let certain things slide without getting involved."</p><p>"I'm no saint, Kimi." Nabiki said in disagreement.</p><p>"No you're not." Kimi agreed. "But you could have just shut down operations. Yasuhara knew that. She knew you would be unable not to do something." Kimi grinned. "Face it Nabs, you're an incorrigible do-gooder." Kimi's grin got wider. "In your own crooked way, of course."</p><p>"Jerk." Muttered Nabiki. From her tone it was obvious her heart wasn't in it.</p><p>"And why are you helping us, Ms Ota?" The warden asked.</p><p>"Me?" Kimi laughed. "Easy. Cause Nabs is."</p><p>"Lt. Noriudo will be here tomorrow to interview you." The warden said. He pressed a button under his desk. The door opened and two guards walked in. "Take these prisoners back to their cell." He said.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Lt. Chikato Noriudo was a stocky man in his fifties. He had steel gray hair that covered his head except for a small bald spot at the crown of his head. He had one of those faces that could be best, and generously, described as 'lived in'. "So this is the infamous Tendo Gang." He remarked. Sitting opposite him was Nabiki, Kimi, Ranma and Akane. He shook his head. "What was the judge thinking by sentencing any of you to prison?"<p>"We broke the law." Nabiki replied. "Well we did."</p><p>"Itsuro, do you have any idea what these people are?' Lt. Noriudo asked.</p><p>"I'm beginning to." The warden replied. "But why don't you tell me."</p><p>"Well let's start with Nabiki Tendo." The lieutenant stood in front of Nabiki. "Hustler, bookie, and, if she wasn't in here, would probably own a quarter of Nerima by now. She also, somehow, paid for several notable civic improvements to downtown Nerima. My grand-daughter plays in that park every weekend." He said to Nabiki. The lieutenant shook his head and took a step. "Ranko Tendo," He snorted. "How's it going Ranma?"</p><p>"Pretty good lieutenant." The red head replied. "I see you remember me."</p><p>"How could I forget?" He replied. "Extraordinary martial artist. In the two years he, sorry she, has been in Nerima, she and her friends kept the crime rate in Nerima down to next to nothing." Another step. " Akane Tendo, Another extraordinary martial artist, Ranma's major partner and one of the friends who was responsible for the lowered crime rate." He chuckled. "How are you doing with your temper these days?"</p><p>"I'm still working on it lieutenant." Akane replied sourly.</p><p>"All that's missing is Ukyo Kuonji, Ryoga Hibiki, Mousse and Shampoo." The lieutenant said. "How is Ukyo by the way?" He said and he let some concern show on his face. "I was sorry to hear she was hurt."</p><p>"She's getting better. Thanks for asking." Ranma replied. "Mousse and Shampoo are back in China and who the hell knows where Ryoga is."</p><p>Lt. Noriudo looked at Kimi. "You I don't know." He said.</p><p>"Kimi Ota." Nabiki replied firmly. She jabbed a thumb at her chest. "My new partner."</p><p>The lieutenant raised an eyebrow. "You must be very good." He remarked. "I never heard Nabiki refer to anybody as her partner before." The lieutenant turned to the warden. "What you have here Itsuro is a group of extremely talented loose cannons that we've tried to get into harness for two years now."</p><p>"Loose cannons." The warden snorted. "Vigilantes you mean."</p><p>"Technically." The lieutenant replied. "But they've been so useful in the past we tended to overlook that aspect of it." The lieutenant turned back to the group of prisoners. "How would all of you like a pardon?" He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out an envelope. "Here's the deal. You go undercover, under my direction, and help me catch the bastards."</p><p>"What if we don't capture them?" Nabiki asked cautiously. 'Hell, this is too good a deal to pass up.'</p><p>"I thought you guys liked a challenge?" The lieutenant replied with a grin. "Deal?"</p><p>"Your call Nabs but if it means I get a shot at the bastard who's responsible for Uk-chan gettin hurt, I wanna do it." Ranma said. Akane and Kimi nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Kimi too?" Asked Nabiki. The lieutenant nodded. "In that case, deal."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hey Sarge." Ranma said in greeting. "Sorry to see us go?" She and Akane were in their cell waiting for their final processing. Ranma thought the plan that the lieutenant had put forward was a bit dramatic but she wasn't going to complain. 'Besides I get out of here.' She thought.<p>"I've got mixed feelings." Sargent Yasuhara said. "You people don't belong here in the first place. " She gave Ranma and Akane a lopsided smile. "On the other hand, I'll miss our lessons." She gave Ranma a respectful bow. "I learned a lot in a short time, sensei."</p><p>"Just keep practicing like I showed ya." Ranma replied. "And don't forget to stretch."</p><p>"I will sensei." Yasuhara replied. "I hope I see you both again." She grinned. "Not here though."</p><p>"We'll work on it." Akane replied. "Oh before I forget." She reached into her tunic top. "Your last cut." She handed the Sargent an envelope. "Oh and Ranma has something for you as well."</p><p>Ranma grinned. "Remember how you asked how I could hide these?" Ranma cupped her breasts. Ranma walked over to the sink and turned on the hot water tap. The water wouldn't really get too hot, but it was hot enough. "Here's how." Ranma pulled off her top and splashed herself with hot water. Ranma immediately changed back to his male form.</p><p>Yasuhara sat down on the empty bunk with a thump. Her mouth moved but no sound came out. Ranma grinned and turned on the cold water. "They're expecting a girl to leave and I don't want to disappoint them." He splashed herself one more time and returned to her shorter buxom female form. Ranma put her tunic top back on. Ranma picked up her small amount of belongings. "See ya around Sargent."</p><p>End Chapter 9</p>
