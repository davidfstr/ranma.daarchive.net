</div><p>Chapter 10</p><p>'Black Widow'</p><p>"When I get my hands on Konatsu." Ryoga pounded a ham-like fist into his equally ham-like palm. "Bam." Ryoga bounced along the rooftops of Nerima searching the skyline for his quarry. 'I know he comes along here.' It had taken a little more than a day to get back to Nerima a feat Ryoga was too angry to be surprised over. He felt his cellphone vibrate and he landed on the next rooftop to answer it. "Yeah." He growled into the phone. "Konatsu." He snarled. "What do you want?" Ryoga looked around. "A residential district." He said into the phone. "No. No water tower." He looked at the phone for a second. "Shit yeah, I want to see you. I want to beat the crap out of you." Ryoga hung up. He folded his massive arms and waited. Fifteen minutes later Konatsu landed softly on the rooftop.</p><p>"Ryoga." Konatsu said in cheerful greeting. "Miss me?" He asked cutely. Konatsu grinned as Ryoga charged him. "Ooh, I like it when you're rough." He ducked the overhand blow and leaped over the follow up kick.</p><p>"I'm gonna pound you into the ground faggot." Ryoga grunted in exertion. "Stop jumping around, ya little monkey." He yelled in frustration. "Yahh." He screamed a second later when Konatsu suddenly seemed to crawl all over Ryoga. Ryoga brushed the Kunoichi away and wiped at his face. "stop that." He growled.</p><p>"Don't be like that." Konatsu purred. "I just want to," Konatsu paused. "Kiss and make up." He finished. Konatsu placed his arms behind his back and batted his eyes at Ryoga. "Come on admit it, you liked it."</p><p>"Did not." Ryoga shot back. "It hurt."</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry." Konatsu said contritely. "I thought those moans meant you liked it." Konatsu walked up and stood in front of the fuming Ryoga. "Next time tell me if I hurt you."</p><p>"There isn't going to be a next time." Konatsu confused Ryoga. He looked like a pretty girl but Ryoga knew he was a guy. 'This is worse than Ranma.' Ryoga thought. 'At least Ranma really becomes a girl.' Ryoga held his hands up in guard. 'And he fights just like him too.'</p><p>"No?" Konatsu said in sad dissappointment. "You sure?" He asked. Ryoga nodded firmly. 'Oh there is definitely going to be a next time.' He vowed internally. 'And I'm horny now.' Konatsu put a pout on his face. "Oh all right." He said aloud. "Can we still be friends?" He asked. Ryoga looked unconvinced but he nodded. Konatsu threw his arms around Ryoga's neck. "Oh thank you Ryoga." Konatsu pressed against Ryoga. He hid a smile as he felt Ryoga's body respond. 'Gotcha.' He thought. Konatsu stepped away. "Tell you what, why don't I make you dinner to make it up to you?" He said. "I was taught by Ukyo and Nodoka." He said enticingly. Ryoga's stomach growled.</p><p>"Well okay." Ryoga said. "But no funny business."</p><p>"Of course not Ryoga." Konatsu said cutely. He took Ryoga's arm. "Come on. We're not too far from the apartment." He said. "Ting Li will be there." Konatsu added.</p><p>"Yeah?" Ryoga said in a more cheerful voice. "Okay lead the way Konatsu." They leaped across the rooftops. It didn't take more than fifteen minutes or so before Konatsu was opening the door of the apartment. "I'm home." He called. "And we have company." There was no reply. "She must have gone out for something." Konatsu said to Ryoga. "Make yourself at home." Konatsu walked over to a counter. "Drink?"</p><p>"You got any scotch?" Ryoga asked. Konatsu picked up a bottle and examined it. Konatsu nodded. "Gimme a shot." Ryoga said.</p><p>"One scotch coming up." Konatsu said. He made Ryoga's drink and then one for himself. He carried the drinks over to the couch. "Move over." Konatsu said as he handed Ryoga his drink. He sat down next to Ryoga. "This is so much better than fighting, don't you think?" Konatsu leaned back bonelessly against the arm of the couch.</p><p>Ryoga blinked. 'It's a guy. It's a guy. It's a guy.' He thought over and over. "Yeah. I guess." He said. He took a large swallow of his drink. He sighed as the alcohol burned down his throat. His second swallow finished the drink. Before he could say anything Konatsu had jumped up and returned with the bottle. Ryoga raised the glass and Konatsu refilled it. "Thanks."</p><p>"Anytime." Konatsu said in a husky voice. He sat back on the couch but this time leaned closer to Ryoga. "You don't know how glad I am we've made up." Konatsu said in a quiet voice forcing Ryoga to lean closer to hear. "It isn't good for friends to fight." Konatsu looked up into Ryoga's eyes. "We are friends, aren't we?"</p><p>'It's a guy.' Ryoga thought weakly. "Yeah, right, friends." He stammered. He nearly dropped his drink when Konatsu threw himself into Ryoga's arms. After a moments shock Ryoga tried to pull the Kunoichi off of him."Hey."</p><p>"Sorry. Sorry." Konatsu said quickly. "I was so happy to know we were friends I forgot myself." Though he removed his arms from around Ryoga's neck he remained leaning against the burly martial artist. Konatsu sighed when Ryoga clumsily patted him on the shoulder. Konatsu experimentally put a hand on Ryoga's thigh. When he didn't flinch Konatsu left it there. "Forgive me?" He asked cutely.</p><p>"Yeah, sure." Ryoga said nervously. "Not a problem." He downed the drink. Konatsu quickly refilled it without moving from his position against Ryoga.</p><p>"Oh I'm so glad." Konatsu said quietly. he let the hand softly stroke Ryoga's thigh. Konatsu smiled as Ryoga made no objection. "You're such a good friend." He felt Ryoga shift slightly. "It there something wrong?" He asked.</p><p>"No. No." Ryoga replied quickly. "I just need to," Ryoga broke off. "Nothing." He finished weakly.</p><p>Konatsu looked down at Ryoga's crotch and smiled knowingly. "Why Ryoga, it looks like you have a little problem." Konatsu leaned closer to Ryoga's crotch. "Too bad you don't think of little me that way or I'd take care of that problem for you." Konatsu sighed dramatically. "Though I do remember you telling me you liked it."</p><p>Ryoga seemed to be caught in an internal battle. Konatsu had reminded Ryoga of the last time he had a 'little problem'. At the time he with so desperate for release he hadn't cared Konatsu was male. It helped then, a lot, that Konatsu looked like an extremely attractive young woman. Now it was making it difficult for Ryoga to resist the advances of what all his senses kept insisting really was an attractive young woman. It didn't help that Konatsu was really good at applying that particular cure.</p><p>Konatsu smiled triumphantly when a moan forced its way through Ryoga's lips. "You look so uncomfortable." Konatsu purred. He started unbuttoning an unresisting Ryoga's trousers. "And I would hate for you to be uncomfortable." Suddenly Konatsu stood up. "Oh I forgot, you don't want me." Konatsu said sadly.</p><p>"Hey!" Ryoga exclaimed in a voice filled with frustration.</p><p>"Yes Ryoga?" Konatsu asked sweetly.</p><p>Ryoga licked his dry lips. "No ones gonna know right?"</p><p>Konatsu smiled and knelt between Ryoga's legs. "Don't worry sugar, this will be our little secret."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma landed on the rooftop. "Hey Ryoga." He called. "What's up?" Ryoga had called earlier and had asked to meet Ranma alone here. "Your sounded funny on the phone." He said with a touch of concern. He examined Ryoga. The burly martial artist seemed sunken somehow. "Man you're not about to pull a shi shi hodokan are you?"<p>Ryoga seemed to shake himself. "It shows huh?" Ryoga blew out a breath. "How do you do it?" He asked. Ryoga waved an encompasing hand. "Being you."</p><p>"Same way anyone else does." Ranma replied with a touch of sarcasm in his voice. "One day at a time." Ranma tilted his head slightly. "That's not what you meant huh?" Ranma shook his head in amusement. "No one is forcing you to fuck Konatsu you know." He raised a hand. "Save it." He told a flustered Ryoga. "I know you are so just accept it." He said firmly. He laughed. "Big bad Ryoga is worried if he's gay." He said.</p><p>"I'm not gay." Ryoga shot back angrily. "I'm not sucking his cock or anything like that. It's not like he looks like a guy anyway." Ryoga added.</p><p>"He's still a guy." Ranma said cheerfully. "Technically that makes you gay." Ranma raised his hands defensively. "Whoa big guy take it easy." He said as Ryoga began to advance angrily. "I said technically." Ranma explained. "It's not like you're gonna start hangin out at gay bars is it?" Ryoga shook his head rapidly in denial. "Although if you do I know a couple you might like."</p><p>"Ranma." Growled Ryoga.</p><p>"Just kidding." Ranma smirked. "You know for such a hotshot martial artist you really are a wuss." Ranma commented. "Why do you care what people think?" He asked.</p><p>"Hey I got a rep to maintain." Ryoga said defensively. "What if it gets out?"</p><p>"So stop seeing Konatsu and Ting Li." He smiled at Ryoga's look of surprise. "She used to live with us remember? Did ya think she wasn't gonna tell us?" Ranma shrugged. "Ting Li's been giving us a," Ranma grinned. 'Blow by blow account of what's been going on." Ranma gave Ryoga a mock salute. "She sounded very satisfied."</p><p>"She did? I mean, well of course." Ryoga replied.</p><p>"Konatsu told us the same thing." Ranma grinned at Ryoga's sputter. "Oh come on, there's hardly a guy who wouldn't envy you right now. Even, maybe especially, the one's that know what Konatsu is." Ranma walked to the edge of the roof and looked out over the bustle of the street below. "Look at them Ryoga." Ranma said. "Everyday they go work in some office or some shop. Their biggest decision is what kind of car to buy or what to have for dinner." He looked at Ryoga. "Sound exciting?"</p><p>"Not really." Ryoga looked almost disgusted. He looked down at the people below. "Fucking zombies."</p><p>Ranma spread his hands. "More like they're afraid Ryoga." Ranma said. "They want to be safe. They want to be accepted and they're afraid if they do anything. " Ranma wiggled two fingers of each hand. "Different, their safe lives will be in danger. If there is crime they'll stay indoors. Trouble overseas? They'll stay at home. Where it's safe." Ranma gave Ryoga a look that contained a lot more respect in it than Ryoga ever saw from Ranma. "Once thing about you Pig Boy, you may be a jerk and a pain in the ass, but no one would ever call you a coward." Ranma said firmly. "Look it comes down to a choice; you either stop seeing the two of them or you don't." Ranma said firmly. "If you don't then you know both Ting Li and Konatsu, especially Konatsu, are going to be very 'in your face' about it."</p><p>"Yeah." Ryoga said moodily. 'That's the problem." He mumbled.</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes. "Look I'll give ya one more thing to think about." Ranma said. "Or rather, let me ask a question." Ryoga gave an irritated wave for Ranma to continue. "Do ya think you can trust them in a fight?" He asked. "Or to put it another way; do ya think Konatsu is gonna watch your back or your ass in a fight?" Ranma stretched. "Well, gotta go. See ya around Pig Boy." Ranma leaped off the roof.</p><p>Ryoga watched as Ranma faded into the distance then he walked to the edge of the building and watched the people below. He stood there for a long time lost in thought.</p><p>"There you are." Came a voice behind him. "We've been looking all over town for you."</p><p>"Hey  Li." Ryoga said without turning around. "You guys were looking for me huh?" Ryoga stared moodily at the street below. "Why?" He asked.</p><p>"What you mean; why?" Ting Li said. "You partner yes?" She walked over to Ryoga and stood on the edge. "What you looking at?" She asked.</p><p>"Them." He pointed. "Never really looked at them before."</p><p>"Someones being moody." Konatsu said. He smiled up at Ryoga. "I know what will make you feel better." He said teasingly.</p><p>"Not now Konatsu." Ryoga said  opened his mouth then closed it. Ryoga gave Konatsu a grateful look. "Thanks." He grunted. Ryoga returned his gaze to the people below. "I didn't mean why were you looking for me." He rumbled. "I meant, why me?"</p><p>"Oh let's see." Konatsu raised a delicate hand. "You're sexy. You're good in bed." He ticked the items off with his other hand. Then Konatsu closed his hand. "But those wouldn't mean a damn thing if you weren't who you are."</p><p>"Easy get man." Ting Li added. "Or woman." She looked unflinchingly into Ryoga's eyes. "That not why we want you."</p><p>"It helps." Konatsu interjected playfully</p><p>"Oh yes." Ting Li said nonchalantly. "But that not real reason. Real reason is you tough. You strong and oh so good fighter. Perfect for us."</p><p>"Perfect?" Ryoga replied both surprised and flattered..</p><p>"Perfect." Ting Li said firmly. "I promise Ranma I watch Nerima." She said. "I need best team possible to keep promise." She made a circular motion with a hand to include the three of them. "This best team, keep Nerima safe."</p><p>"You mean this is all just to get me on your team?" Ryoga asked. "Couldn't we be a team without it?"</p><p>Ting Li giggled. "Sure. We warriors. We fight." She pointed to the people walking below. "Keep them safe. That what we do." She butted Ryoga with her shoulder. "Not mean we not have fun at same time."</p><p>"Fun, yeah, with you." Ryoga grumbled. "That I understand. But why Konatsu?"</p><p>"Cause he got hots for you just like me." Ting Li said cheerfully. "I not mind, it make Konatsu happy. It good when partner happy."</p><p>"Come on baby." Konatsu said. "Admit it, you think I'm hot." He preened. "Well I am hot. In fact I'm so hot even the straightest guy in Nerima, meaning you, wants me." He wiggled. "Damn good for my ego." He said smugly.</p><p>Despite his moodiness Ryoga had to smile. "Like you need your ego boosted." Ryoga said in mild sarcasm. "The straightest guy in Nerima huh?"</p><p>"As straight as they get." Konatsu confirmed. He leaned against Ryoga and placed a hand over the burly martial artist's mouth. "Trust me, I would know." He said easily. "Now stop worrying about it." He said firmly. "And start enjoying it." He looped an arm through Ryoga's. Ting Li did the same with Ryoga's other arm. "Let's go home." Konatsu said. "Okay?"</p><p>Ryoga blew out a breath. "Okay Konatsu."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Good afternoon Abe." Kodachi said as she approached the door to Ky's private club.<p>"Ms. Kuno." Abe replied. He opened the door for Kodachi.</p><p>Kodachi entered Ky's private club. A slight smile appeared on her face as she was greeted by a number of the women working there. She returned the greetings politely but did not pause as she made a beeline for Ky's office. Kodachi fought down a sense of guilt as she realized just how long it had been since she last saw Ky. 'I must make it up to him.' She told herself. 'But it has been busy.' She reminded herself. She knocked on the door. She heard Ky's voice telling her to come in. She opened the door.</p><p>Ky looked up a hungry smile appeared on his face as he saw Kodachi. "Kodachi." He said in pleased greeting. His pleasure increased when Kodachi walked over and demanded and received a kiss. "Gods I missed you." Ky said after the kiss.</p><p>"Did you miss me enough to take a break and have lunch with me?" Kodachi asked teasingly. "Or do I have to drag you out of here?"</p><p>Ky Young Ji smiled. "I'd be a fool to take such a threat lightly." He replied. "And that would not be good for my reputation."</p><p>"Indeed it wouldn't." Kodachi laughed. "Shall we go?"</p><p>Ky offered his arm to Kodachi and the two walked out of Ky's office. "Where did you want to go for lunch?" Ky asked as they exited the building.</p><p>"There is this quaint little noodle shop that I've heard some good things about." Kodachi replied. "It's close by." She said. "Close enough to walk." She leaned closer to Ky. "And it is such a beautiful day."</p><p>"Then we will walk." Ky replied. "My Lady."</p><p>Kodachi blushed. "Ky." She scolded. "You're being presumptuous." She complained though it was obvious her heart was not in it. Kodachi gave Ky a sidelong glance. 'He means it.' She thought in happy wonder. Kodachi pulled heself closer to Ky. "But I think I can forgive you, this time." She smiled at Ky and was about to say something when Ky suddenly sagged and fell to the ground.</p><p>"Ky?" Kodachi knelt down. "Ky?' She repeated. Then Kodachi noticed the blood pooling on the ground. "Ky!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki rushed into the hospital. "Where is she?' He growled in anxious frustration. "Where is my sister?" Tatewaki barked at the admitting nurse. "Where is Kodachi Kuno?"<p>The nurse looked at the admission records. "I'm sorry sir, there was no one by that name admitted." She said.</p><p>"Do you have a record of a Ky Young Ji being admitted?" Kimi asked as she and Nabiki finally caught up with Tatewaki.</p><p>The nurse looked at her records. "I'm sorry." She said quietly. "The doctor did the best he could." She added. "Were you family?"</p><p>Kimi blanched. "N-no not family." She replied. "Business," Kimi broke off. "Friends." She amended. "The young woman that was with him." Kimi asked.</p><p>"Third floor." The nurse replied. "I'm really sorry about your friend." She said to the retreating backs of Kimi, Nabiki and Tatewaki.</p><p>Tatewaki walked so quickly that both Kimi and Nabiki were forced to trot to keep up. He didn't bother with the elevator and instead found the nearest stairwell and raced up them taking the steps two and three at a time. Nabiki and Kimi were left behind. By the time they made it to the third floor they found Tatewaki comforting a sobbing Kodachi.</p><p>"He's dead. He's dead." Kodachi sobbed over and over into Tatewaki's shoulder. "Ky." She wailed in abject misery. Tatewaki said nothing but continued to hold Kodachi in his arms.</p><p>Nabiki pulled out her cell phone. "Tokio? Tendo here." She barked. "Ky is dead." She explained. "I want to know who and I want to know now." She snapped the phone closed. Nabiki walked over to the nurse's station. "I want to speak to the doctor who treated Mr. Young Ji." She said in a voice that seemed to threaten dire punishment if she was not obeyed. The nurse swallowed.</p><p>"Dr. Hagakura." She said. "He's not," She licked suddenly dry lips. "I'll call him."</p><p>"Do that." Nabiki ordered. "Kimi." She called. "See if you can get Tatewaki and Kodachi back to the mansion, then stay with Kodachi."</p><p>Kimi nodded. "I already called Auntie." Kimi said in a no-nonsense voice. "She'll meet us at the mansion." She looked at Nabiki. "Where are you going to be?"</p><p>"I'm going to talk to the doctor then meet with Tokio and Kyoshi." Nabiki replied. "We're going to have to answer this and answer it hard." She grimaced. "And we're going to have to find a successor to Ky."</p><p>"That's not going to be easy." Kimi pinched the bridge of her nose. "Damn." She cursed. She looked over to where Tatewaki was still comforting Kodachi. "poor thing." She said softly. Kimi walked over to Tatewaki. "Let's get her home." She said to the kendoist. Tatewaki nodded and lifted Kodachi into his arms.</p><p>"Ky." Kodachi wailed again as Tatewaki carried her away.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki sat stiffly in her chair as the murmur of conversation ebbed and flowed around her. Suddenly she slammed her hand on the table. "Enough." She snapped. "Tokio have your people found anything?"<p>The Yakusa lord grimaced angrily. "Not a fucking thing." He replied angrily. "Nothing on the street. Nothing from our other contacts. If it was one of our rivals they're keeping a tight lip."</p><p>"A new family?" Hazarded Kyoshi. "Someone trying to make a name by taking out one of the Ice Queen's main people."</p><p>"Has anyone taken a shot at you recently?" Tokio asked. Kyoshi shook his head. "Same here. Nothing." He looked at Nabiki. "No, the target was Ky and Ky only." Tokio's eyes widened. "Noichi." He said suddenly. "I'd bet anything, it was Noichi."</p><p>Nabiki leaned back in her chair and thought hard. "I agree he's involved but there was the attack on Ranma's group." She said. "The personal nature of the attacks point to grudges against me." Nabiki's expression turned cold. "Nakamura." She said in her iciest tones.</p><p>"I can assemble a team in twenty-four hours." Tokio said in cold anticipation. "I'll bring you their heads on a platter."</p><p>The smile that appeared on Nabiki's face had nothing of amusement in it. "Thank you, but I think I will handle this one personally." Nabiki leaned forward. "Until this is settled I suggest you keep your territories nice and quiet." Her icy gaze swept the few others present Nabiki trusted enough not to cause her trouble. "All of you." Nabiki waited until there were nods of agreement and acceptance from everyone. "In the meantime, I will administer Ky's territory until I can find a suitable replacement." She raised an eyebrow in challenge.</p><p>A junior member seemed to about to protest when both Tokio and Kyoshi glared at him. The man subsided. Kyoshi turned to Nabiki. "Of course Ice Queen, it is your right." He said in very firm tones. It was obvious he wasn't speaking to Nabiki but to the junior members. "No one disputes that."</p><p>"Thank you." Nabiki replied.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka knocked softly on the door to Kodachi' suite. There was no answer. Nodoka knocked again and then opened the door. Nodoka entered into a darkened room. Nodoka could just make out a shape on the bed. She padded over. Kodachi was lying on the asleep on the bed, still dressed in the same clothes she had been wearing when Ky had been shot. From the stains on Kodachi's pillow it was obvious the young woman had cried herself to sleep.<p>Nodoka sighed and removed some of the sleeping girl's clothes and was just about to cover her with the blanket when Kodachi opened her eyes.</p><p>"He's dead Auntie." Kodachi said in a near monotone. "I hoped it was a bad dream but it isn't, is it?"</p><p>"No dear." Nodoka replied gently.</p><p>Kodachi sat up slowly. "I keep thinking it's somehow my fault he's dead." Kodachi said in a quiet voice. "That it was really me that was the target and Ky," Kodachi swallowed in a painfully dry throat. "Ky just got in the way."</p><p>Nodoka sighed. "That's unlikely dear." She said.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "I know." She said. She looked at Nodoka forlornly. "Yet somehow I wish it were so." Kodachi looked down. "He was a good man Auntie." She said. "A good man."</p><p>"Did you love him?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>Kodachi shook her head sadly. "I liked him." She corrected. "I think I even admired him." Tears again came to Kodachi's eyes. "I wanted to take it slow. I wanted to get to know him. To see if I could learn to love him." She said her voice got raspier. "Now I'll never know, I'll never know."</p><p>"Oh my poor dear." Nodoka said sadly. She took the younger women in her arms and stroked her hair. "My poor, poor dear."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The day Ky Young Ji was buried was appropriately overcast. The caravan of black limosines had slowly wended their way toward the cemetary. Their police escorts waited patiently at the entrance. The ceremony had been suitably somber. All that remained was a silent ring of observers that surrounded a lone figure.<p>Kodachi Kuno knelt in front of the shrine to Ky Young Ji. She lit incense and said a prayer. From her gloves to the veil covering her face she wore black. Kodachi said another prayer.</p><p>Nabiki too wore black. A business suit. Ky may have been dead and Nabiki would have loved to be able to show her sorrow but she had an image she had to maintain. And business, like life, went on. She took the opportunity of the funeral to exchange a few quiet words with her senior lieutenants and a few less quiet ones with one Police lieutenant. The fact that Chikato even showed was an unexpected surprise.</p><p>"I am not going to have a gang war in Tokyo." He said brusquely. "If anything starts, the first person I'm going to arrest, is you." Chikato growled.</p><p>"It's already started Lieutenant." Nabiki replied coldly. "If I don't make a stand now it all falls apart." She said. "Arresting me now won't stop anything. If anything it will make it worse." Nabiki looked at Ky's shrine. "Arrest me afterwards." Nabiki strode away and didn't look back.</p><p>End Chapter 10</p><p>Author's Notes: I said this was going to be darker than my usual fare.</p><p>One reviewer asked if I was making Ryoga bi or gay. Nah. Or as Ranma put it; technically he's gay, but here is the question: If you don't know or can't tell if the other person is of the same sex as you, are you gay?</p><p>In the Manga, just as no one could tell Ukyo was female until her breasts were exposed, no one can tell that Konatsu is male, until his lack of breasts was exposed.</p>
