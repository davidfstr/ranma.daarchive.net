</div><p>Chapter 6</p><p>'Punishment to fit the crime'</p><p>The paparazzi perked up as another limo approached. The driver opened the door and a slightly stocky though fit man in his fifties stepped out. More than one photographer smiled in anticipation. They immediately recognized the man as Genji Morimoto though less for the fact that he was a very successful businessman and more for the women who usually accompanied him.</p><p>Genji reached a hand in and the first thing the photographers saw were a pair of very long and very shapely legs. Cameras flashed and the photographers started shouting a single name. "Makoto. Makoto." They shouted. Makoto smiled but turned back to the car. The photographers could see that Makoto had the end of a leash in her hand. The cameras flashed as she tugged on the leash. Out of the car came a woman. She was dressed in a black leather outfit that fitted her from neck to ankles and to wrists like a second skin. White furry gloves and boots covered her hands and feet. Her face had been expertly made up to resemble a cat's. A pair of white cat ears peaked out of her hair and around her neck was the other end of the leash.</p><p>Makoto took Genji's arm and the two of them strolled into the club. Yuki in her cat outfit padded along behind.</p><p>Cameras flashed. "Gods, I love the rich and famous." One photographer said gleefully. Unseen a figure in dark colors slipped next to the side of the building. The figure seemed to wait for another flashing of cameras and then began to effortlessly climb up the side of the building.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Chouji Tamasayo and Naoki Yamada were deep in conversation. As the evening had worn on and Gem and Jewel had not made their reappearance they were beginning to have second thoughts. "I don't know how you talked me into this, Naoki." Grumbled Chouji Tamasayo.</p><p>"Hey, don't blame me." Replied. Naoki Yamada. "It's our Moms who insisted we do this." He said grumpily. "And the more I think about it, the worse the idea gets." He shook his head. "Sure Gem and Jewel are hot..." He sighed. "At least in the pictures we saw."</p><p>"You think they were 'shopped?" Chouji asked. Naoki hestitated for a second then somewhat reluctantly shook his head. "I didn't think so either." Chouji said. "Hey cheer up." Chouji said suddenly. "Look on the bright side, if they don't pick us that means we can see Miki again."</p><p>"That's true." Agreed smiled. He looked up as the light from the outer club was blocked off. Two young women were standing at the end of booth. Naoki sat up. "Whoa." He breathed.</p><p>"Is that any way to say hello?" An exotic looking girl with high cheekbones asked in a throaty purr.</p><p>Chouji and Naoki hastily climbed to their feet and bowed deeply. "Good evening." They chorused.</p><p>"That better." the exotic girl said. "May we join you?"</p><p>"Please." Gasped Chouji. To the young men's surprise the two young women came into the booth and squeezed passed them to sit together. Chouji and Naoki looked at each other and then sat flanking them. Chouji sat next to Pema and Naoki sat next to Kagomi. "I'm Chouji." Chouji said in introduction.</p><p>"Naoki." Naoki quickly added.</p><p>"I Jewel." Pema said looking first at Chouji then Naoki. She pointed to Kagomi. "That Gem."</p><p>"B-but we know..." Began Chouji.</p><p>"Jewel and Gem." Pema said firmly.</p><p>"Sure, Jewel and Gem." Naoki said quickly. "Whatever you want."</p><p>"Keep thinking like that and everything will be fine." Kagomi said with a smile.</p><p>Naoki chuckled in response. "Speaking of which, do you want something to drink?"</p><p>Kagomi turned to Pema. "Hey, he learns quick." She said. "If we say yes, what will you order?" She asked Naoki.</p><p>"Champagne?" Guessed Naoki.</p><p>"Good boy." Purred Kagomi. She reached over and pressed a button set into the side of the table. Within moments a hostess, it was Ami, appeared at the table. "Hi Ami." Kagomi greeted the blond. "Champagne, they're buying."</p><p>"Of course they are." Ami replied. "Hi boys." She said warmly. "Nice to see you again."</p><p>"Um, hi Ami." Chouji replied uncomfortably. "Nice...nice seeing you again too." He said. "You're. um, you're looking good."</p><p>"Why thank you, Chouji." Ami replied with a smile. "I'll be right back with the champagne." She promised and walked away.</p><p>Chouji leaned back against the seat. "You, um, know Ami?" He asked Pema.</p><p>"We know all girls here." Pema replied. "They our friends." She tapped Chouji on the nose. "We know all about Ami and Miki." She said cheerfully.</p><p>"You do?" Chouji replied nervously.</p><p>"Like Jewel said, they're our friends." Kagomi said.</p><p>"You, um, don't mind?" Naoki asked.</p><p>"We no mind." Pema replied with a smile. "Because it happen before." She said. "Now no more Miki or Ami." Pema said firmly. "Now only Gem and Jewel, yes?"</p><p>"Yes." Chorused Naoki and Chouji quickly. They looked at each other. "Does that mean...um...?"</p><p>"Hey, you're cute when you blush." Kagomi said cheerfully. "We haven't decided yet." The sounds of swing music came from RJ's piano."Can you boys dance?" Kagomi asked suddenly.</p><p>"Some." Naoki replied.</p><p>"Good." Kagomi said. "I want to dance."</p><p>Naoki and Kagomi went to the dance floor and began dancing to the music. Moments later they were joined by Pema and Chouji. When the song ended the two girls giggled and switched partners for the next dance. They switched back and forth several times before they returned, laughing, to the booth. The champagne had been delivered and Chouji poured glasses for the four of them. Chouji raised his glass. "A toast." He said. "To new friends."</p><p>"To new friends." Chorused Naoki, Pema and Kagomi. The four touched glasses and downed their champagne.</p><p>Pema and Kagomi looked at each other. Pema raised an eyebrow and Kagomi nodded eagerly. Pema grinned. "I think it time you meet Ranma." Pema said. 'Then, if Ranma say it okay, you meet Lord and Lady Kuno and Lady Kimi." Pema stood and took Chouji's hand. Kagomi did the same with Naoki. Pema and Kagomi led Chouji and Naoki across the club and to one of the private booths. With the privacy curtain open Chouji and Naoki could see that the booth was occupied by three people.</p><p>"Damn." Naoki murmured. "That's the Terrible Three." He said in awed realization.</p><p>"Of course." Pema replied. "Who you think I mean when I say Ranma?" She said. "We Daddy's Girls."</p><p>"I knew who you meant." Naoki said. "But...I guess I didn't know, know." He looked at Pema."And you guys live with them?" He asked. Pema nodded cheerfully. Naoki exchanged looks with Chouji and the two young men bowed very deeply when they reached the table.</p><p>Pema nodded in approval. "Ranma." Pema said. "This Chouji Tamasayo and Naoki Yamada." She said in introduction. "They want be our boyfriends." Chouji and Naoki bowed again.</p><p>Ranma stood up and walked out of the booth and started circling the two young men. Chouji and Naoki stood nervously stiff as Ranma continued his circle. Suddenly the two young men jumped. "Hey." Squeaked Chouji and Naoki. "Nice asses." Ranma said.</p><p>Pema and Kagomi giggled. Pema walked over to Ranma and shook her finger at him. "You no touch without ask first." She scolded playfully. Ranma grinned. "So, it okay?" Pema asked a moment later.</p><p>"It's okay, Punkin." Ranma replied. "They seem nice enough." He said. Ranma turned to the two young men. "Okay, you can date Jewel and Gem ." He said. "Just remember that they're..." Ranma pointed to himself. "My girls." He said firmly. "Understand?"</p><p>"Yes sir." Naoki said quickly. Chouji nodded rapidly.</p><p>"Good." Ranma grunted. "Why don't you..." Ranma looked up. "Hmm, maybe not." He said. Ranma nodded with his head. Pema and Kagomi turned. A buxom Chinese woman with long purple hair and wearing a high slit purple and red Changsom was approaching the table.</p><p>"What she doing here?' Pema hissed in annoyance.</p><p>"Be good, punkin." Ranma said. "I invited her." Akane and Ukyo stood and exited the booth and took up position on either side of Ranma. "Hello Shampoo." Ranma said in greeting. "So you decided to come after all."</p><p>"Is that promise?" Shampoo asked with a wide smile. "Hello Ranma." She said in a husky voice. She nodded to Akane and Ukyo. "Akane. Ukyo." She said in cooler greeting. "And little Mountain Girl and her fuck slut here too." She laughed. Pema snarled in response.</p><p>Akane gave Pema and Kagomi a quelling glance. "I said you could come here if you weren't going to be a bitch, Shampoo." Akane said coldly.</p><p>"Why's it suddenly getting cold in here?" Chouji whispered to Naoki. He blew out a breath and watched it steam.</p><p>"Hard to break old habit." Shampoo replied with a slight smile on her face.</p><p>"Well break it fast." Snapped Akane. "Or I'll make you beg Jewel for Ranma's cock." Akane laughed. "And you know what she's going to say."</p><p>"No one take joke no more." Shampoo complained. She sighed. "Oh okay." She gave Pema a curt bow. "I apologize for calling your...friend, fuck slut." She said.</p><p>Pema ignored Shampoo. "Why she here, Ranma?" Pema asked plaintively.</p><p>"To keep the peace, punkin." Ranma replied. "Sometimes even I have to do things I don't want to." He said. "Now don't pout." He said. Ranma leaned forward and started whispering in Pema's ear. At first Pema's face reflected anger then it slowly changed, first to annoyance and then Pema turned her head and gave Shampoo an amused look. Pema turned back to Ranma and nodded. "That's my girl." Ranma said in approval. "Now, why don't you take your new boyfriends to meet Nabs and Tatewaki?"</p><p>"Okay, Ranma." Pema replied. She gave Shampoo that same amused look. "Too bad I not be home to see." She said.</p><p>"Too bad." Agreed Shampoo. "Maybe you learn something."</p><p>"Pema not one who going learn something." Pema sneered. She waved her fingers at Shampoo. She turned to Kagomi. "We go see Lord Kuno now." She said firmly. She gave Shampoo one last amused smile and then took Chouji's hand and led him away. Kagomi grabbed Naoki's hand and dragged him after Pema and Chouji.</p><p>"What are they going to do to her?' Kagomi asked in anticipation.</p><p>Pema giggled. "Remember when Ukyo got jealous of Gem and Jewel?" Pema replied. "Remember what Ranma NOT do for whole week?"</p><p>Kagomi giggled. "I can't believe how much she likes...ohh." Kagomi said in sudden realization. "Who?" She asked in anticipation. "Oh please tell me it's going to be Akane."</p><p>"Akane and Ukyo." Pema replied in satisfied tones. She and Kagomi giggled.</p><p>"We're missing something." Chouji said to Naoki."At least it's warmer here." He said. "We must have been standing under the AC or something."</p><p>"What do you think that was all about?" Naoki asked. "Who was that...?"</p><p>"You don't want to know." Kagomi said with a tight smile."We forgot to ask." She continued. "Either one of you know how to fight?"</p><p>Chouji and Naoki looked at each other for a second. They grinned at each other. They returned their attention to Kagomi. "We wouldn't want to brag..." He began.</p><p>"Good." Kagomi said seriously. "Don't." She cautioned.</p><p>"It not good idea get in between, when gods fight." Pema warned.</p><p>"Gods?" Chouji asked.</p><p>Pema nodded firmly. So did Kagomi. "You be around Ranma, . you see." Pema said.</p><p>"Trust us, boys." Kagomi said. A secretive smile appeared on her face. "It's futile to argue against someone who is telling the truth." She said. "What Jewel means is that anyone who goes against Ranma, is either an idiot or someone who can kill you in a heartbeat."</p><p>Chouji looked at Naoki again. "They're not kidding, are they?" Chouji asked. Naoki shook his head slowly. They shrugged. "Okay." Chouji said simply. "Yeah, we can fight."</p><p>"Good." Kagomi smiled.</p><p>"I ask Ranma give you lessons." Pema said in decision.</p><p>They continued through the club. Chouji and Naoki kept looking at each other with similar looks of confusion on their faces. Similar thoughts went through their heads. The evening was not going at all as they expected. Not the evening, not the girls, not...anything. Oh Gem and Jewel were as attractive as hell and the two young men looked forward to the implied promise being fulfilled. But the...encounter earlier with the Terrible Three and the purple haired Chinese girl would not leave their thoughts.</p><p>They approached a large table in a corner of the club. The table was situated in such a way that it commanded an enviable view of the stage and the gaming two young men's expressions became serious as they stopped in front of the table. Chouji and Naoki recognized most of the people at the table. Lord Kuno's face had graced many a magazine cover, recently and most usually with the two women who flanked him. Nabiki, Lady Kuno, The Ice Queen was a frequent subject of magazine and newspaper articles. Not always in a positive light. The blond sitting on the other side of Tatewaki Kuno was mentioned less frequently but still often enough for the two young mens fathers had cautioned their sons to be very polite to the Lady Kimi.</p><p>It was both the young mens fathers unanimous opinion that The Ice Queen and her Handmaiden were two of the hardest working and successful business people they had ever met. They also both agreed that having them as enemies would not be...healthy. Both their fathers had sat them down the previous evening and...explained that if they did happen to meet the Ice Queen, or any known associates of the Ice Queen, that they had better be extremely polite.</p><p>"Good evening, ladies, gentlemen." Tatewaki said in greeting.</p><p>"Good evening Lord Kuno." Pema and Kagomi replied. "May we present, Chouji Tamasayo and Naoki Yamada." Pema said formally. Chouji Tamasaoyo and Naoki Yamada bowed deeply.</p><p>"A pleasure." Tatewaki replied. "May I present , my wife, the Lady Kuno and her sister by adoption the Lady Kimi." The two young men bowed just as deeply. "My sister, Kodachi Kuno." Tatewaki continued. "And her companion, Noriko Mata." Chouji and Naoki bowed again. "My Sister's ward, Kiko and Kiko's mother, Koko."</p><p>"Don't forget, Uncle Hiro." Kiko piped up.</p><p>"I'd be terribly remiss if I did." Tatewaki replied. "And Koko's...suitor...Hiroichi Kiyuo." He said. "Please, sit." Tatewaki said politely but in tones that made it an order. Chouji and Naoki pulled out chairs for Pema and Kagomi, seated them, before taking their own seats on either side of them. Chouji and Naoki put attentive and polite expressions on their faces.</p><p>"Well you seem presentable enough." Tatewaki said. He looked at Pema and Kagomi. "I assume they've met Ranma." He said. Pema nodded. Tatewaki nodded in return. "Since you're here I must also assume he's approved." Tatewaki rumbled in slightly disapproving tones.</p><p>"Yes, Lord Kuno." Pema agreed. "Only one person need approve now."</p><p>"I assume you mean my Lady." Tatewaki replied.</p><p>Pema giggled. "Oh no, Lord Kuno." Pema replied. "Lady Kuno already approve." She said. "No, must get approval from most important person here." She said. "Right Gem?"</p><p>"Oh, definitely, Jewel." Agreed Kagomi with a smile. She and Pema looked at Kiko. "So?" She asked. "What do you think?"</p><p>Even Tatewaki smiled at Kagomi's words. "I needs admit, she has the right of it." He said in an aside to Nabiki. "At least for now."</p><p>Kiko got up from her seat and bowed to her mother before walking around the table. Not that her mother noticed, she and Hiro were still too engrossed in each other to pay much attention to what was going on around them, much to Kiko's delighted approval. 'I wonder if he'll move into our apartment or we'll move into his.' She thought. Kiko walked around the table to take a closer look at Chouji and Naoki.</p><p>Chouji and Naoki found the scrutiny from the young girl somewhat intimidating. In fact it seemed that both 'Gem' and 'Jewel' also appeared slightly uneasy. Finally the young girl folded her arms across her chest. "I guess they're okay." She said. "They don't talk much, though."</p><p>"That could be counted in their favor, Kiko." Kodachi said in amusement.</p><p>Kiko was about to giggle in response when something caught her attention. "Auntie, look out." She said suddenly. Kiko leaped across the table and tackled her Aunt just as something slammed into the table and shattered it.</p><p>Tatewaki shot to his feet and pushed both Nabiki and Kimi behind him. A sword appeared in his hand as if by magic. Twin ringing sounds were heard as Pema and Kagomi unfolded metal fans and took guard positions next to each other. Koko dove on top of Hiro. Chouji and Naoki remained seated too stunned to move for several long seconds before they finally got to their feet and faced the threat.</p><p>The first thing anyone saw was a pink haired woman in a dark colored Chinese pant suit and holding a mace in one hand. The woman would have normally been considered beautiful but the look of pure hate on her face twisted her face into something horrific and bringing into highlight three faint lines running across one cheek. She advanced toward where Kodachi lay under the protective form of Kiko.</p><p>Kodachi pushed Kiko off of her and bounced to her feet. "I don't know who you are." She began.</p><p>"Don't know?" Screamed the pink haired girl. "Don't know?" She screamed again in outrage. The sound of someone running toward her caused the woman to spin around with her mace raised. Approaching her was the purple haired form of Shampoo. "I won't go back." She screamed more in fear than rage, her anger at Kodachi completely forgotten. "I won't." Her voice took on a sobbing note.</p><p>"Is that anyway for Joketsuzoku to act, Hika?" Shampoo said in disgust.</p><p>"Hikaru." Screamed the woman. "Not Hika, Hikaru."</p><p>"Hikaru?" Chorused Nabiki and Kimi. The two women took a closer look at the pink haired woman. "Oh hell, Nabs." Kimi said in recognition. "It really is Hikaru."</p><p>"I sorry for Hika's behavior." Shampoo said to Kodachi. "She run away from village." She said in explanation. "No worry, we take her back."</p><p>"No." Shouted Hikaru Nakamura in terror. She started spinning the mace in a protective pattern. "Keep her away." She screamed hysterically. "Stay away." She shouted at Shampoo.</p><p>"Stop." A commanding voice pierced the air. Nodoka strode toward the table. "What is the meaning of this?" She demanded. "Our clients are in an uproar." Nodoka gave the pink haired woman an appraising glance. "If you're looking for the father of your child, there are better ways than destroying furniture." She said. "Kodachi." Nodoka said sharply. "Is she one of the girls from one of your other clubs?" She asked.</p><p>"She's no girl, mom." Ranma said as he walked up behind Nodoka. "That's Hikaru Nakamura." He said. "I told you about..." Ranma trailed off. "Child?" He asked.</p><p>"She obviously pregnant, my son." Nodoka said. "And just as obviously, frightened out of her mind." Nodoka walked over calmly, ignoring the mace. She put her arm around the pink haired woman's shoulders. "Come along dear." Nodoka said firmly. "A nice cup of tea would do you good."</p><p>To everyone's surprise Hikaru dropped the mace and clutched Nodoka. "Don't let her take me back." She pleaded.</p><p>"Shh." Nodoka said gently. "No one will take you anywhere you don't want to go." She said. "Ranma will see to that." She said to the sobbing Hikaru. "Come along dear." She repeated. Hikaru meekly allowed herself to be led away.</p><p>Ranma blew out a breath and turned to Shampoo. "Locked, huh?" Shampoo nodded. "Hmm." Ranma said. "And the father is...?"</p><p>"That not important." Shampoo said quickly.</p><p>"Meaning that you're the father." Nabiki said coldly. "Why didn't you just kill him?" She asked. Nabiki waved a hand. "Never mind, I think I know why." She said in realization.</p><p>"That was Hikaru?" Kodachi said in surprise. "So that's what Cologne meant." She raised a hand and a good number of women hurried over to Kodachi. Several were wearing black catsuits and wearing bird masks. One bird masked woman was leading a woman on a leash who's face was made up to look like a cat. "Tsumi, Tobi." Kodachi said to the bird and cat pair. "Guard Auntie and our guest." She nodded toward where Nodoka was leading a still sobbing Hikaru. The two women nodded and hurried after Nodoka and Hikaru. "The rest of you, stand down and calm the patrons." The women, both masked and not, nodded and hurried away.</p><p>Kodachi turned to Shampoo. "Is Lady Kuno correct?" Kodachi asked in tones of restrained anger. "Are you the father?" She asked. Shampoo hesitated before nodding reluctantly. "Much as I despised Hikaru and everything he represented, I cannot and will not tolerate rape." She said. "Even for someone who so richly deserved to suffer."</p><p>"Why you care? He kill..." Began Shampoo.</p><p>"Do not defile his name by speaking it." Kodachi said in cold fury. "He was your creature." She pointed out angrily. "He would not have been the monster he was without your help." Kodachi took a deep breath. "Leave." She said. "I will discuss...Hika's fate with your grandmother... tomorrow."</p><p>"Come on, Shampoo." Akane said in surprisingly cheerful tones. "You can stay with us tonight." She smiled and put her arm around Shampoo's waist. "We're going to have so much fun." She promised in a purr. "Maybe even as much fun as Hika had."</p><p>Pema and Kagomi watched as Akane led Shampoo away with Ranma and Ukyo trailing. They turned to each other and gave each other identical coldly satisfied smiles. "Purple haired bitch not going be able to sit for week." Pema said.</p><p>"Couldn't happen to a nicer girl." Kagomi agreed. "Maybe she wont be able to speak for a week as well." She said. Pema snorted in amusement.</p><p>"What just happened?" Chouji Tamasayo asked in plaintive tones. "Who was that?"</p><p>"And why was everyone calling her, 'he'?" Naoki added.</p><p>"And why did it get so cold in here?" Chouji complained.</p><p>"Told you." Pema said. "It not good to get between, when gods fight." She said. "But you do okay." Pema added with a touch of approval. "Not get scared." Pema turned to Tatewaki, Nabiki and Kimi. "If you excuse, we want talk to boyfriends."</p><p>"We'll expect you and your boyfriends and their parents for dinner next week." Nabiki said in Ice Queen tones. She nodded to Pema and Kagomi.</p><p>Pema took Naoki's hand and Kagomi took Chouji's. They walked away from the table. "Where're we going?" Naoki asked Pema.</p><p>Pema smiled. "You do good so we give you little reward." She said. Pema and Kagomi led the two young men to a door and opened it. It revealed itself as an elevator and the two couples got in. Pema pressed a button and the elevator smoothly began to ascend with a faint hum. It was a short trip to the third floor but long enough for Chouji and Naoki to give each other a look. They shrugged at each other.</p><p>When the door opened it revealed a subduedly lighted room, with rich red textured wallpaper and chocolate brown leather couches and chairs. Before Chouji and Naoki could make any comments they were led to a side door. Pema took a card from her clutch purse and slid it through the lock. The door opened with a click.</p><p>Pema pushed the door open and the four entered the small suite. "Hey not bad." Said Chouji in appreciation. He turned his head and spotted the bar. "I could use a drink." He said. Chouji turned to Kagomi. "You mind...?" He asked.</p><p>"What are you having?" Kagomi asked.</p><p>"Scotch, if you have it." Chouji replied.</p><p>"A small one for me with plenty of ice." Kagomi said. "Jewel?" She said to Pema. Pema nodded. "Make it two." She said.</p><p>"Two with lots of ice, got it." Chouji went to the bar. "Naoki?" He asked. His cousin nodded. Chouji quickly made the drinks and gave Pema and Kagomi theirs. Naoki wandered over to the bar and took his own. He and Chouji took a healthy swallow before turning their attention back to Pema and Kagomi.</p><p>The two girls were perched on the arms of a small couch. Pema nodded her head toward the couch.</p><p>Chouji looked at Naoki. "Gem or Jewel?"He asked.</p><p>"Does it matter?" Naoki replied. He walked over to the couch and sat down closest to Kagomi. Chouji sat down on the side next to Pema. The two men took another healthy swallow of their drinks.</p><p>"Don't get drunk on us." Kagomi warned. Pema made a noise of agreement.</p><p>"What was that?" Naoki asked. "I thought I was in the middle of a war zone."</p><p>"You were." Kagomi replied. "That...girl...isn't...well she is but she used to be a guy." She explained. "Long story and you won't believe us until you find out for yourself." She took a sip of her drink.</p><p>"Jewel think that sound like fun." Pena said. Kagomi grinned. "Hika used...to be Hikaru." She said. "Very bad man." She frowned. "Tried kill me once."</p><p>"What?" Exclaimed both Chouji and Naoki.</p><p>Pema nodded. "Hurt Gem very bad." She gave Kagomi a look that expressed her horror at the memory. Pema's expression calmed. "But then Ranma fix, not see Hikaru for years." She smiled wryly. "Now that Jewel see again, Jewel almost feel sorry." She said. "Almost."</p><p>"And the purple haired woman?" Asked Chouji. "One of, um, Hikaru's..." He waved a hand. "Women?" Pema and Kagomi laughed. "That was funny?" Chouji asked in surprise.</p><p>"Very funny." Pema replied. She reached with a hand and started plaing with Chouji's hair. "Enough talk about other women." She said firmly. "If you want talk about women, you talk about us."</p><p>"That's assuming you still want to be our boyfriends." Kagomi said. She started copying Pema's actions with Naoki.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi sat at her private booth as Abe and several other of her male employees cleared away the remains of the table that Hikaru had shattered. Sitting next to her was Kiko. Every so often she'd look at Kiko. 'Her first thought was to protect me.' She thought over and over. "Baby?' She said eventually.</p><p>"Yes, Auntie Dachi?" Replied Kiko. Kiko tilted her head. "Are you all right, Auntie Dachi?" She asked.</p><p>"I'm fine, sweetheart." Kodachi replied. "I was...I was just wondering, now that your mother has a boyfriend..." She hesitated. "Well...now that she has a boyfriend, I was wondering...your Mother's apartment isn't that big and I'm sure they'd like some privacy..."</p><p>Kiko giggled. "I know my Mom would." She said. "I don't think Uncle Hiro cares as long as he's with Mom."</p><p>Kodachi smiled. "Probably not." She agreed. "Well, I was thinking, and if your mother agrees, I was thinking that maybe you could...permanently move into the mansion?"</p><p>"Oh, like I'm going to say no." Kiko said with another giggle. "I don't think Mom will mind." Kiko said. "Or notice." She grinned. "At least for a while." She nodded toward a separate table where Kiko's mother and Hiro were sitting together. "She really likes him, Auntie Dachi." Kiko said in satisfaction. She turned her attention back to Kodachi. "You know what I want, Auntie Dachi?"</p><p>"What, sweetheart?' Kodachi replied.</p><p>"A baby brother or sister." Kiko said. Kiko looked down at the table. "I don't think Uncle Hiro will run out on her."</p><p>"No, I don't think he would." Kodachi agreed. She sighed. "I need to speak to...her." She said. "Would you care to come with me?" She asked. "I think I'd feel better if you were there."</p><p>Kiko put a serious look on her face as she nodded. "I think I'd feel better if I were there too." She said. Kiko stood and waited for Kodachi to stand. When Kodachi got to her feet, Kiko took hold of one of Kodachi's hands. They started walking toward Kodachi's private office. "You know what else I would like, Auntie Dachi?" Kiko said.</p><p>"What's that sweetheart?' Kodachi asked.</p><p>"I know you'll probably think it's silly but, well, if I live at the mansion..." Kiko looked up, though not as far as she used to, at Kodachi. "Do you think...oh, it's silly..."</p><p>"No matter how silly, I promise not to laugh." Kodachi said with a smile.</p><p>Kiko looked down. "Do you think, at least sometimes, I could call you...Mother?" Kiko asked hesitantly. She looked up as she heard a sob. "Auntie?" She said in concern. "Oh, I'm sorry Auntie I didn't mean to..." She stopped as Kodachi hugged her. "Auntie?"</p><p>"I would very much like for you to call me Mother." Kodachi said tearfully. "At least when your real mother isn't around."</p><p>Kiko hugged Kodachi back. "Mom says sometimes she's not even sure who my real mother is." Kiko said. "Mom says I act more like you than her." She said. Kiko stepped back. "Tell you what, I'll call mom, Mom and you...Mother." She said. "Okay, Mother?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Lemon: yes there is one.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi opened the door to her office and she and Kiko walked in. The office was dimly lit with only a single light illuminating the room. The light came from a baby spotlight that shone on a small table that held a single rose in a vase. It took a moment to find Nodoka and the pink haired Hikaru. They were sitting on a small couch off to one side. Well, Nodoka was sitting on the couch, Hikaru was lying on her side and curled into a tight ball. Standing off to one side were the masked forms of Makoto and Yuki. They nodded to Kodachi and Kiko. Kodachi noted, with approval, that despite the leash around Yuki's neck, the Kuno bodyguard was on high alert and that Makoto had her knives at hand.</p><p>Not that it appeared that either Yuki's skills or Makoto's knives were necessary. Faint sobs came from the curled up figure on the couch. Nodoka was rubbing the pink haired woman's back. "I can't believe I'm going to say this." Muttered Kodachi. "How is she?" She said in a louder voice.</p><p>"I suppose as well as can be expected." Nodoka replied in quiet tones. "My son said he went through something similar the first time he was stuck." Nodoka sighed. "There, there," She said soothingly. "It was a terribly cruel thing they did to you." Nodoka said.</p><p>"What's wrong with being a girl?" Kiko asked in affronted tones.</p><p>"Nothing, sweetheart." Kodachi replied. "If you're born a girl." She said. "But for someone like Hikaru, it's very cruel."</p><p>Hikaru rolled over on the couch. "I-I apo-apo-apologize, f-f-for earlier...I-I.." She stopped as she began sobbing again.</p><p>Kodachi walked over to the table under the spotlight and looked at the card that was under the glass. "You killed the only man I truly loved." Kodachi said in controlled tones. Kodachi felt Kiko take her hand. She looked at Kiko and smiled gratefully. "You don't know how many times I sat where you sit now and wept." She said looking down at the card. "Or how many times I wished I had killed you then and there."</p><p>"Yo-yo-you d-d-don't know h-how m-many t-t-times I wished y-you h-h-had." Hikaru replied brokenly. "Instead of..." She broke into another fit of sobbing.</p><p>"So, you blamed me." Kodachi said quietly.</p><p>"Yes." HIkaru whispered.</p><p>Kodachi turned around. "Is Shampoo the father?" She asked.</p><p>Hikaru nodded. "Only...only...only m-m-man I could not d-d-d-defeat." Stammered Hikaru. Hikaru buried her face in her hands. "I-I b-b-begged b-b-but sh-she ...I b-begged...I begged." Hikaru began to sob louder. "Look what she did to me." She suddenly screamed. She put her hands over her slightly rounded belly. "Look what she did to me." Her voice rose in hysteria. She buried her face against Nodoka's shoulder and sobbed loudly.</p><p>The door to the office opened and Noriko walked in quietly. "Is everything all right, Ms. Kuno?" She asked.</p><p>Kodachi sighed. "I don't think things have been 'all right' for some time now, Noriko." She replied. Kodachi looked at the sobbing Hikaru. "Is the Ice Queen still here?"</p><p>"Yes, Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied. "That's why I'm here." She explained. "She asked me to convey two things; one that Shampoo is necessary to her plans." Noriko grinned. "And two, that it doesn't mean you can't whip her ass." She said. "Sorry Auntie." She said to Nodoka. "She did say that you may wish to wait on the second though, as Akane has her own plans for Shampoo's ass." She smiled. "Sorry Auntie." Noriko nodded toward HIkaru. "What are you going to do with her?"</p><p>HIkaru lifted pink haired her head. "Don't send me back, please." She said in frightened tones. "Please."</p><p>"How far along are you?" Kodachi asked instead.</p><p>"I-I don't know." Hikaru replied in tones of misery. "Three, four...I don't know." She exclaimed. "All I k-know is that I'm..I'm...I'm...No." She wailed in anguish. "I can't be...I can't...No." She howled again. "Th-there's th-this thing." She shouted in a voice that rose in panic. "Growing...in me."</p><p>"It's called a baby, dear." Nodoka admonished. "Not a thing."</p><p>"No." Hikaru said in pained denial. "I can't..."</p><p>"Yes." Kodachi said. "A life for a life, Hikaru." She said. Kodachi pointed at Hikaru's stomach. "A baby," She said. "For Ky." She stared hard at Hikaru. "And for my protection." She said sternly. "Decide."</p><p>Hikaru's already defeated and beaten expression crumbled even further. She hung her pink haired head. "I'm so scared." She whimpered.</p><p>"Decide, Hikaru." Kodachi repeated. The former hit man's houlders slumped even further. Finally the pink haired woman nodded. "Noriko, have Abe get Hikaru to a safe house." She ordered. "And see if Ono can see her tonight."</p><p>"Yes, Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Shampoo entered Ranma's apartment. The ride to the apartment wasn't that long but Shampoo was beginning to tire of the looks she was receiving from Akane and Ukyo. Truth be told she was also a little nervous. Akane had defeated her in their last meeting and Shampoo had no reason to believe she'd be any more successful next time. "Nice apartment." Shampoo began.</p><p>"Yes it is." Akane interrupted. "Don't get used to it." She said. "Who wants a drink?" She asked.</p><p>"Make me a double, Tomboy." Ranma said as he sat down on the leather couch. "I'm gonna need it."</p><p>"Having second thoughts about giving the Bimbo a baby, Ran-chan?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Having second thoughts about sticking my dick in her pus...cunt." Ranma replied. "Who knows what I might catch."</p><p>"Why you be so mean, Ranma?" Pouted Shampoo. "Shampoo no have dirty shimaymay." She said in hurt tones. "Shampoo not street whore."</p><p>"It isn't the cocks that have been in your cunt that worries me, Shampoo." Ranma said. "I just wouldn't put it past you or the old ghoul stuffing it with drugs."</p><p>"He's got a point, sugar." Ukyo said. She took a drink from Akane. Akane walked over and gave Ranma his drink then walked back to the bar to fix her own drink.</p><p>"Shampoo no do that." Shampoo protested."Shampoo no need do that." She added forcibly.</p><p>Ranma sighed. "Yeah, probably not." He said reluctantly. "You really the father?" He asked. Shampoo looked down. She nodded. "Thought you didn't like being a guy." Ranma commented.</p><p>"Don't." Shampoo replied. "Can Shampoo have drink?" She asked Akane. "Please?' She added quickly. "Something strong."</p><p>Akane gave Shampoo a look before she nodded. "Ice?" She asked. Shampoo shook her head. Akane nodded again and poured something into a glass. She brought the drink to Shampoo. Shampoo took the glass a downed the contents and handed the glass back to Akane. Akane walked back to the bar and poured a second shot into the glass and gave it back to Shampoo.</p><p>Shampoo took the drink. "No matter how rough Ranma be." She snorted. "Or Akane." She gave Akane a wry look. "Still be better than Hikaru." She said. "I like rough...most times." She admitted. "Just not all time." Shampoo looked down at the glass. "Don't expect Shampoo feel sorry for Hikaru." She downed the drink. "Now what?"</p><p>"The first thing you're going to do is get down on your knees and beg Ranma for forgiveness for all the shit you put him through." Akane said coldly. "And if, and only if, he decides to forgive you, then that fat ass of yours is going to get reamed." Akane walked over to Shampoo and stared into her eyes. "And then, maybe, Ranma will give you the baby you want." She said. "The baby you need."</p><p>"Shampoo ass not fat." Grumped Shampoo. "Shampoo have nice ass."</p><p>"That's one of the things we're going to find out, Sugar." Ukyo said in anticipatory tones.</p><p>"You too, Spatula Girl?" Shampoo asked with a touch of surprise in her voice.</p><p>"You really think I'm going to pass up on this kind of opportunity?" Ukyo asked with a laugh. "I may not turn guy as often as the Tomboy does, but I have my moments." She said. "Maybe if you beg nicely enough, the Tomboy will let me go first."</p><p>"That's supposed to be reward?" Shampoo said sourly.</p><p>"I'm smaller than the Tomboy." Ukyo replied with a wide grin.</p><p>"Oh, that make it so, so better." Shampoo replied in disgust. "Why we need do this?"</p><p>"Because you were one hell of a pain in the ass, Shampoo." Akane replied with an evil smile. "Thought we'd return the favor."</p><p>"You've lost, Shampoo." Ranma said with a cold smile. "That's why you're here." He said. "I know you and I know the old ghoul." He said. "Beg, Shampoo and the war is over." He leaned back against the couch. "You get a baby, so you don't go home in disgrace, Cologne gets a piece of Nabiki's pie and we all live happily ever after." He smiled as Akane and Ukyo both snorted in amusement.</p><p>Shampoo sighed. "Why we always think Ranma dumb." She asked no one in particular.</p><p>"He works at it." Akane replied. "Get on your knees, Shampoo." She ordered.</p><p>Shampoo sighed and slowly sank to her knees. "Shampoo tired of war. Tired of being Ranma enemy." She said quietly. She bent forward until her head touched the ground. "Please forgive Shampoo." She said.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Lemon: Yes there is a second one</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Cologne raised her wrinkled head as the door to their apartment opened. It was a good sized and well appointed apartment, two floors above the club that fronted as hers and Shampoo's base of operations. "Ah, Shampoo, you've returned." She said. Cologne frowned as the disheveled form of her apprentice staggered into the main room. "What happened to you?" She asked in more annoyance than concern. "I trust whoever did this to you has been eliminated."</p><p>"Great grandmother." Shampoo replied in sour tones. She rubbed her rear for a moment. "Great grandmother, Shaampoo never think she say this, but...shut up." She staggered across the maiin room and over to a bar. Shampoo poured herself a drink.</p><p>"Shampoo." Cologne said in shocked tones.</p><p>"I need bath." Shampoo decided. Shampoo turned and looked at the old woman. "Ranma will give Shampoo the child Shampoo need." She snorted. "Maybe already pregnant."</p><p>"Excellent." Cologne replied. "That still does not excluse your disrespectful behavior."</p><p>"No?" Shampoo replied. "That only because you not know what it like." Shampoo snorted in self disgust. Then she gave Cologne a defiant look. "And because I no longer belong to you."</p><p>"Shampoo?" The old woman said in surprise. "What are you saying?"</p><p>"Shampoo saying what Shampoo mean." The purple haired Shampoo replied. "Shampoo no longer your whore."</p><p>"Whore?" Cologne narrowed her eyes at Shampoo.</p><p>"Whore." Shampoo affirmed. "Akane Tendo riught, Shampoo whore." She said. Shampoo waved an encompassing hand. "This...this all come from Shampoo lying on back and spreading legs." She said. "Shampoo good whore." She looked at her drink, raised the glass to her lips and downed the contents. She looked down at her empty glass. "Now that Shampoo know, Shampoo decide she no longer want be Great Grandmother's whore." She said. "If Shampoo must be whore she want be Ranma's whore." Shampoo put the glass down and walked to the hallway that led to her room and the bath. "Oh, Shampoo almost forget." She said. "Rib...Black Widow have Hika."</p><p>"What?" Exclaimed Cologne. "We must..."</p><p>"Hika lost to us." Shampoo interrupted. "Child...maybe not." She said. "Now, Shampoo have nice hot bath and get sleep." She said. "Good night, great grandmother." Shampoo left the room without a backward glance.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki Kuno walked into his study. He was wearing a formal kimono in the Kuno colors as was the headband he wrore around his walked over to a large and ornately carved cabinet. From the outside, with it's small shelves containing incense burners that Tateaki carefully lit, it resembled a family shrine. There were even cushions placed in front of the cabinet. Tatewaki opened the two large front doors of the cabinet to reveal a large screen. Tatewaki picked up a small black box that was in front of the screen and walked to the cushions. Tatewaki knelt down on the middle cushion.</p><p>The door to his study and Nabiki and Kimi walked into the study. Like Tatewaki they wore formal Kimono. Nabiki and Kimi took their places on the cushions next to Tatewaki.</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno pressed a button on the box then placed it carefully to one side. The screen lit up to reveal an regal though somewhat mild looking man in his mid sixties. Tatewaki, Nabiki and Kimi bowed their heads.</p><p>"Good evening, My Lord Kuno." The man said. "Lady Kuno, Lady Kimi."</p><p>"Good evening, Tenshi." Tatewaki replied in formal tones. Nabiki and Kimi responded in quiet voices.</p><p>"The Empress sends her fond regards." The man said. A slightly disapproving look appeared on his face. "She also said to remind Lady Kuno that two years is long enough."</p><p>"Please thank her highness for her concern and please let her know that it will not be a matter of concern much longer." Nabiki replied.</p><p>"The Empress will be pleased to hear that." The man said. "I'm sure Lord Kuno is just as pleased." He said. "A very interesting report appeared on my desk this morning." The Emperor said in pleasant tones. "It appears that there has been a decided decrease in pirate activity." He said. "Your Captain is most effective."</p><p>"He will be pleased to hear you approve, Your Highness." Tatewaki said.</p><p>"And you, Lady Kuno." The Emperor continued. "Appear most effective in your tasks as well." The Emperor smiled somewhat wistfully. "Would that I could publically acknowledge what you have done and continue to do."</p><p>"I thank His Majesty for such consideration." Nabiki replied. "But that would be...unwise." She said. "As His Majesty well knows."</p><p>The Emperor sighed. "I do indeed." He said."You're a very brave woman, Lady Kuno."</p><p>"She is a Tendo, Tenshi." Tatewaki Kuno rumbled proudly. "Being brave is what a Tendo is." He said. "As I have learned."</p><p>"My Lord gives me too much credit." Nabiki replied in here best Ice Queen tones.</p><p>The Emperor laughed. "Fascinating."</p><p>End Chapter 6</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Epilogue</p><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight." The pretty brunette and bespectacled reporter said. "I'm your host, Mitsui Oh." She said. "This is my last night hosting Japan Tonight, Saatchi Kato returns tomorrow." The reporter swivled her chair to face another camera. "It's been a very exciting month for me.' She said. "And it's an experience I'll never forget." She smiled. "For the past month I've been reporting on the antics and glamour of the mysterious Sumire, so it's only fitting that my final guests tonight are Sumire and Michiko Osakawa." She stood. "Ladies and gentlemen it is my honor to introduce; Michiko Osakawa and Sumire." She turned and applauded along with the audience. From the wings came two women, the fit and trim Michiko Osakawa and the violet garbed and masked Sumire.</p><p>Mitsui Oh walked over to the center stage where a conversation nook had been set up and bowed as the two women approached. "Ms. Osakawa, Sumire." She said in greeting.</p><p>"Call me, Mitch." Michiko Osakawa replied. "All my friends do."</p><p>"An honor...Mitch." Mitsui Oh replied. "Please, be seated." The two women sat. "I was very surprised when you called requesting to be on my final show."</p><p>"Final, for now." Sumire replied. "I'm sure this wont be the last time you host Japan Tonight." She said with a smile. "Mitch and I both enjoyed your shows."</p><p>"Thank you." Mitsui Oh replied. She laughed. "Maybe you could put in a good word with Ms. Kato."</p><p>Sumire and Michiko looked at each other and grinned. "Oh, I think we can do that." Sumire replied. "Personally I think you're wasted just reporting the weather." She said. "Don't you think so, Mitch?"</p><p>"Oh, definitely." Michiko Osakawa replied.</p><p>'From your mouth to Saatchi's ear.' Mitsui Oh thought. She gave Sumire an envious look. 'Look at her; dress, hair, nails...all perfect.' She leaned forward slightly as something came to her attention. "That's a beautiful necklace." Mitsui Oh said to Sumire. "And so unusual."</p><p>"Thank you." Agreed Sumire. She took a hold of the spider shaped pendant for a second before releasing it. "It's one of my greatest possessions."</p><p>The reporter nodded in understanding agreement. "As I was saying, I was very surprised when you contacted the producer asking to be on my...tonights's show." Mitsui Oh continued.</p><p>"Oh that's because Sumire is...taking a short break." Sumire replied with a smile. She turned to the murmuring audience. "Oh not forever." She said directly to the audience. "I enjoy being Sumire too much to give her up." She said chidingly. "But even ladies of mystery have to pay the bills." She sighed. "Tomorrow, I must return to my...other life." She said sadly. "And I just wanted to come by and say thank you."</p><p>"Speaking of your...other life." Mitsui Oh said. "There has been so much speculation..." She said leadingly. "Some believe you're hiding a tragic past."</p><p>"Tragic?" Replied Sumire. "I suppose, in a way." She straightened in her chair aand placed her clasped hands across her knees. "But it was a tragedy of my own making." She said.</p><p>Mitsui blinked.'That sounded like an intro...no...' She thought. She blinked again as Sumire turned in her seat to directly speak into the camera. "Oh my." She breathed.</p><p>Sumire looked into the camera. "For the passed month you have seen and heard about Sumire." She said in professional speaking tones. "The tabloids and television have been filled with speculation." She continued. "The big question of course is; who is she?" She said. "And what secrets lie behind the mask?" She gave a professional smile. "Tonight, we will find out."</p><p>"Sa..." Began Mitsui Oh.</p><p>"Ah, ah, ah." Sumire replied. "You can't just blurt it out." She chided. She returned her attention to the camera. "As I was saying, tonight we will find out." She smiled. "Let's start with the secrets, shall we?" She said. "And to help us, we've invited the two people who know Sumire best." She tapped herself on the chest and then reclasped her hands. "Me, of course." She said with a quiet laugh. "And the one person who would know Sumire almost as well as Sumire is her friend and..."</p><p>"I think companion will do." Michiko Osakawa said with a broad smile. "Damn, you're good at this."</p><p>"Why thank you Mitch." Sumire smiled. "Her friend and companion, Michiko Osakawa." Her smile widened. "When we come back."</p><p>"And off." Shouted the director. "Oh hell."</p><p>"The phones are ringing off the hook." Someone shouted from a doorway. "Hell, we're getting calls from Brazil for crissake."</p><p>"Saatchi?" Exclaimed Mitsui Oh. "is that really you?"</p><p>"Hello, Mitsui." Saatchi Kato replied. It was a subtle difference between Sumire and Saatchi Kato. A slight shift in tone and cadence. To Saatchi Kato it felt odd to be Saatchi and not Sumire. 'Like putting on a mask.' She thought. She smiled and became Sumire again. "I hope you aren't too disappointed in me." She said with a touch of amusement in her voice.</p><p>"Disappointed?" Exclaimed Mitsui Oh. "Surprised, yes." She said. "Shocked, definitely." She shook her head. "And envious as all hell." She admitted. "Disapponted...that word didn't even come to mind." She leaned forward. "This is a heck of a gamble you're taking, you know that?"</p><p>"Ten Seconds, Ms. Kato." A stage hand called. "Sorry, eight seconds, Ms. Oh."</p><p>Sumire laughed. "I'm not the only one gambling." She replied. "I just gave you the story of the year." She waved a hand to the camera. "See what you can do with it."</p><p>Mitsui Oh blinked then turned to face the camera just as the director finished his count down. "And, we're back." She took a deep breath. "For those just joining us we have Sumire and Michiko Osakawa as our guests and Sumire was just about to reveal her identity." Mitsui paused. "And before we continue, our guest really is Sumire as the presence of Michiko Osakawa attests." Mitsui swiveled her chair. "But for the record, Mitch, is this really Sumire?"</p><p>"She's Sumire all right." Michiko replied.</p><p>"I had no doubt but there might have been skeptics in our audience." Mitsui said. "Sumire, when I asked if the rumors of a tragic past were true, you claimed it was a tragedy of your own making,." She said. "Yet I think it would be difficult for anyone to believe that of someone who, in your other persona, is one of the most successful and recognizable people on television."</p><p>"Excellent question, Mitsui." Saatchi/Sumire replied. "Oh it's true I am successful and, in my own small way, famous." She admitted. "But it wasn't until I became Sumire that I realized the price of my success." She said. "Success is an empty victory when you have no one to share it with, Mitsui."</p><p>Mitsui raised an eyebrow. "Are you saying you became Sumire to find...companionship?"</p><p>Sumire laughed. "Oh my, no." She said. "I became Sumire to find a story." She turned her head and looked at Michiko Osakawa.."What I found instead was...Mitch." She smiled at Michiko and then turned her attention back to Mitsui. "And I found...me." She said in more serious tones. "A month ago, I made a...let's call it a deal, with Kodachi Kuno." She said. "I wanted to get behind the scenes of Tokyo's most exclusive and most enigmatic club." She rolled her eyes. "You would not believe some of the rumors I had heard about Ky's Cafe American and Ms. Kuno herself." She said. "And being, I thought, a good reporter, I wanted to find out for myself."</p><p>"Well there are a lot of rumors." Mitsui Oh pointed out. "Some even claim that the club is nothing more than a, a brothel." Sumire and Michiko started laughing. "That was funny?"</p><p>"Funnier than you can imagine." Sumire replied. Michiko contnued to giggle. "Mitch can you imagine Ms. Kuno as a ..as a...?"</p><p>"A Madam?" Michiko replied in between giggles. "I am so going to tease Dachi the next time I see her." She promised. Michiko wiped at her eyes. "Is that what people really think?" She asked Mitsui Oh.</p><p>"There has been...talk." Mitsui Oh replied. "Makoto for example." She said. "There are those who claim she is nothing more than a high priced escort."</p><p>"And is now married to Genji Morimoto." Sumire/Saatchi replied. "I think Genji would be very upset to hear that his wife is being slandered in such a fashion." She turned to Michiko. "Don't you think so, Mitch?"</p><p>"I'd be more worried that Makoto would take offense." Michiko replied. "You know how protective she is of Genji."</p><p>"Good point." Sumire/Saatchi replied. She rubbed the pendant around her neck for a second. "But those were the very rumors that caused me to make the deal with Ms. Kuno." Sumire said. "I should have realized immediately that the rumors were false once Ms. Kuno accepted my proposal."</p><p>"I see." Mitsui Oh replied. "What about the supposed connection with the Yakusa?" She asked. "And the belief by many that the Ice Queen herself has a stake in Ky's Cafe."</p><p>"Oh, Lady Kuno definitely has a financial interest in Ky's Cafe." Sumire/Saatchi replied. "But to insinuate that Lady Kuno, and by extension, Lord Kuno are involved in criminal activities." She shook her head. "While it's true that Lady Kuno has been in prison and, according to Lady Kuno, rightfully so, it's a crime she has paid for." She shook her head again. "So many people are jealous of her success." She said sadly. "It's a terribly misguided jealousy considering that Lady Kuno has been spearheading an economic redevelopment project, a legitimate redevelopment project, that has already been successful in reducing unemployment in some of the more benighted areas of Tokyo." Sumire/Saatchi put a disapproving look on her face. "It's time for such attacks on Lady Kuno to stop." She said firmly. "Did you know that the Tax Authority audits all of Lady Kuno's financial records quarterly?" She pointed out. "Audits that she passes each and every time."</p><p>"I didn't know that." Admitted Mitsui Oh. "But if that's true..." Mitsui Oh nodded in understanding. "I can see why you believe the attacks on Lady Kuno are motivated by jealousy." Mitsui glanced up at a clock on the wall. "We're almost out of time." She said. "One last question or rather...a request." She said. "May we see the lady behind the mask?"</p><p>Saatchi/Sumire took a breath. "Do you know I'm actually nervous about removing my mask?' She said almost to herself. "Mitch, would you mind?"</p><p>Michiko stood and stood behind Sumire/Saatchi. "I'll remove the mask, but I'll expect you to be wearing it tonight at the theatre." She said teasingly. Michiko squeezed Saatchi/Sumire's shoulder for a second before undoing the ties that held her current mask in place.</p><p>Saatchi/Sumire raised her hands to her face and slowly removed the mask. A faint gasp was heard from the small studio audience. Saatchi turned to the camera. "This is Saatchi Kato, for now, saying...good night."</p><p>"And off." Called the director.</p><p>End Book 8</p><p>Author's Notes: I think I've said this before but I'm always sad when I finish and post the final chapter of any of my stories.
