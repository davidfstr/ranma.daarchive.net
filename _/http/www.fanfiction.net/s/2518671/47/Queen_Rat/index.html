</div><p>Book 5</p><p>Fallen Angels</p><p>'Makoto '</p><p>Nodoka sat drinking tea. For once in her own kitchen. It was early afternoon and having slept late and still not needing to be at the Club for another couple of hours, Nodoka enjoyed this moment of relaxation. Uk-chan's was being run by the son and daughter of a friend of hers. They needed the income and Nodoka was more than happy to have someone else run it. She didn't even consider having Konatsu run the restaurant. Or Ting Li. The brother and sister gave Nodoka forty percent of the profits. She had asked Ukyo's permission first of course. Ukyo not only approved she insisted Nodoka keep the profits. Nodoka did but she had started a savings account for Ukyo with most of it. It was already a sizable amount. 'She'll never want, no matter what happens.' Nodoka thought in satisfaction.</p><p>Genma was at work. To both of their surprise, Genma enjoyed construction work. Not that he didn't sometimes need a little prodding to actually do work, but once he got started he pulled more than his weight.</p><p>Nodoka sighed. "He'll probably show up again tonight." She said to herself. She sighed again. "And they'll probably show up as well." Nodoka blushed and fanned herself. "Nodoka Saotome you should be ashamed of yourself." She said in scolding tones that couldn't hide the laughter underneath. She fanned herself again. A small smile appeared on her face.</p><p>The sudden sound of her doorbell abruptly shattered her reverie and Nodoka started. She looked at the wall clock. "Odd, I'm not expecting anyone." She shrugged and wrapped her robe around her; she'd dress later, and went to answer the door. "Yes?" She said through the door.</p><p>"Mrs. Saotome?" Came a woman's voice. "I'm so sorry to disturb you unannounced." The woman's voice continued. "Can I speak to you?"</p><p>Nodoka raised an eyebrow and opened the door. A women in her late thirties or early fourties stood at the door way. Standing next to her was a very tall, athletic looking, young woman in her early twenties at the most. Nodoka frowned at the heavy makeup the girl was wearing. "Why do you wish to speak to me, Mrs,?"</p><p>"Hiramatsu, Noemi Hiramatsu." The woman said in hurried introduction. "This is my ungrateful daughter Makoto." She said. "Bow." Noemi hissed out of the side of her mouth. "For once try not to be rude."</p><p>"Mother." Makoto said in embarrassed annoyance. She gave Nodoka a barely civil bow.</p><p>Nodoka examined the women more closely. The older woman's face reflected a life of struggle and want. Though with a dignity that came with meeting those struggles. And even prospering to a small extent. The younger woman's face reflected barely concealed boredom. Nodoka shrugged mentally. "Please come in." She said. "I'll make some tea."</p><p>"Oh please don't go to any trouble." Noemi Hiramatsu said hurriedly.</p><p>"Oh no trouble." Nodoka said calmly. She led the two women into the kitchen. "Please sit." Nodoka made some tea and served her two visitors. "So, what can I do for you Mrs Hiramatsu?"</p><p>"Not me, my daughter." Noemi Hramatsu replied. "She's such a disappointment."</p><p>"I'm sitting right here mother." Makoto said in annoyance. "Mother is just mad that I didn't go to college."</p><p>"You passed the exams." Noemi replied heatedly. "Your father and I would have found the money."</p><p>"And then what?" Makoto shot back. "I become an office lady while I look for a husband?" Makoto snorted. "No thank you."</p><p>"You don't want to get married?" Nodoka asked curiously.</p><p>"No she'd rather spend all her time going to parties and doing who knows what with who knows who." She turned in her chair. "You never tell me where you are , you come home at all hours of the night. I'm sick of it, do you hear, sick of it."</p><p>"I'm a grown woman mother." Makoto snapped. "Honestly you treat me like I was twelve."</p><p>"Ahem." Nodoka cleared her throat.</p><p>Noemi Hiramatsu flushed. "My apologies."</p><p>Nodoka waved a hand in dismissal and turned her attention to  younger woman was pretty, but, in Nodoka's opinion garishly made up. Despite the girl's mother's complaint Nodoka thought the girl was trying too hard to appear wild. 'And failing.' She thought. "I don't think that shade of eyeshadow suits you." Nodoka said. "And sit up straight." She snapped. Makoto responded to Nodoka command almost without thinking. "better." Nodoka continued her visual examination. "I don't know." She murmured dubiously. "It would take a lot of work."</p><p>"Mrs. Saotome?" Noemi Hiramatsu asked.</p><p>"Oh I don't know." Nodoka repeated. "Fumie did say they needed another waitress at the club."</p><p>"Club?" Noemi Hiramatsu and her daughter chorused. Though in completely different tones. Makoto sounding much more interested.</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "A friend of my son's owns it." She explained. "She may be willing to give your daughter a position. Maybe." She added in emphasis. She looked at Makoto critically. "But not as you are right now."</p><p>"What's wrong with the way I look?" Complained Makoto.</p><p>"You look like a slut." Her mother shot back.</p><p>"Crude." Nodoka said. "But somewhat accurate." She looked at Noemi. "If you wouldn't mind leaving your daughter here, we will see if she will do tonight."</p><p>"Tonight?" Chorused Makoto and her mother. "But, but." Noemi protested. "I was hoping," The woman trailed off at the stern look from Nodoka. "Yes of course." She said in quieter tones. "I apologize Mrs Saotome." The woman said contritely. She turned to her daughter. "Don't you dare embarrass us." She hissed. She stood.</p><p>Nodoka stood as well. "Let me escort you to the door." Nodoka said. She looked at Makoto. "You stay where you are." She ordered.</p><p>Makoto swallowed. She had never met any woman as forceful as this and she found herself almost instinctively obeying. She nodded nervously. She watched Nodoka escort her mother out of the kitchen. She heard Nodoka say something unintelligable to her mother then the sound of the door opening and then after a long pause closing. Makoto fidgited nervously in her chair. "Damn that woman is scary." She said under her breath.</p><p>Nodoka walked back into the kitchen and walked to the counter. She turned around and crossed her arms. "Stand up." She ordered. "I said, stand up." She repeated forcefully when the young woman failed to respond. Makoto jumped to her feet as if stung. "Better." She said. "Understand this, I will not stand for any slovenly behavior from you." She raised an imperious finger. "You do not speak until I have finished." She ordered.</p><p>Makoto opened her mouth to retort hotly and stopped with her mouth open. She had heard the term stone faced but now she understood what it really meant. This woman meant business. Makoto slowly closed her mouth and nodded.</p><p>Nodoka gave the younger woman a faintly approving smile before returning to it's previous unyielding expression. She pointed toward the kitchen door. "Walk." She ordered. "The first thing we are doing is have you wash off that horrible makeup." She said. "Fortunately for you Koko will be here in an hour and she'll do your face properly." Makoto walked as indicated. "In there." Nodoka ordered.</p><p>Makoto walked into a mid sized bathroom. She looked questioningly at Nodoka. Nodoka waved a hand. "Soap and water will do." Nodoka said. "And you can use the towel behind you." She watched critically as Makoto began washing the makeup off her face. "That should be enough." Nodoka said.</p><p>Malota dried her face on the towel. "Now what?" She asked in annoyance.</p><p>"Now?" Nodoka replied. "Now we will talk." She walked from the bathroom. After a moment Mokota followed. Nodoka walked back to the kitchen. She pointed to the seats. "Sit." Nodoka waited until Makoto sat before she took her own seat. She gave the young girl a critical look. "Well you're pretty enough without makeup." She said. "And it appears you can hold your tongue if you want." Nodoka leaned back. "Let's assume you're a normal young woman of?" She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Nineteen." Makoto replied.</p><p>"Nineteen." Nodoka said musingly. "I was married at Nineteen." She leaned forward. "I had a son by twenty." She shrugged. "I love my son but sometimes I wish I had waited."</p><p>"For a minute there I thought you were going to tell me i should get married, just like my mother." Makoto said in some relief.</p><p>"I am not your mother." Nodoka replied tartly. "If you were a more traditional girl I might but I see that you are not." Nodoka leaned back again and crossed her arms. "Okay we've established that you are nineteen. Since you passed the college entrance exams I must also accept that you are intelligent." She said. "Why didn't you want to go to college?"</p><p>Makoto shrugged. "What for?" She replied sourly. "Sure I passed the exams but just barely." She admitted. "I think I was more lucky than smart." Makoto sighed. "High school was hard enough." She said almost angrily. "I don't want to go to college and I certainly don't want to get married." She snapped.</p><p>"What do you want?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"I want to live a little. Have some fun before I have to settle down." She rolled her eyes. "And I don't want to settle down right now." Makoto leaned her elbows on the table and rested her head in her cupped hands. She sighed.</p><p>Nodoka smiled indulgently. "Indeed." She said. "As I was saying you're obviously a normal, intelligent, reasonably attractive young woman of nineteen." Nodoka said. "And you're unemployed and living at home?" Nodoka inquired.</p><p>Makoto nodded. "Yeah." She said sourly. "That's about it."</p><p>"I want you to think of tonight as an entrance exam." Nodoka said suddenly. "If at the end of tonight I am satisfied with your performance I will recommend you to Kodachi."</p><p>"Kodachi?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"Kodachi Kuno." Nodoka replied. "Some call her The Black Widow." She smiled at Makoto's suddenly widened eyes. "Ah, I see you've heard of her."</p><p>"Oh gods yes." Makoto gasped. "Everyone is talking about her. How she lost the love of her life to an assassin's bullet and then tracked the killer down herself." She sighed. "It's so romantic."</p><p>"Quite." Nodoka said dryly. "Now, let's see if I have something suitable for you to wear tonight." She stood a crooked a finger. "Come with me." She led Makoto into the back of the house. "When my son had to go away I had some of his things brought here." Nodoka explained.</p><p>"Your son?" Makoto said slowly.</p><p>Nodoka opened a closet door. "My son." She affirmed. "He's somewhat larger than you in the chest department but I think we'll be able to put together something acceptable." She reached into the closet. "Now this skirt would look good on you."</p><p>"Your son wears dresses?" Makoto took the skirt. Then what Nodoka had said registered. "Your son has breasts?"</p><p>"Only when he's a girl." Nodoka replied. "Now this blouse is very nice and I think it should fit." She said. "Now what size shoes do you wear?"</p><p>"Five?" Squeaked Makoto.</p><p>"Ah you're in luck." She knelt down and took out a pair of pumps. "These should fit and they'll match the skirt." She handed the shoes to Makoto. "Well what are you waiting for? Get dressed." Ordered Nodoka. "Koko will be here soon and we need to be ready."</p><p>Makoto nodded dumbly and removed her street clothes and started putting on the skirt. "Mrs. Saotome?" She said in a voice that cracked nervously. "About your son." She began.</p><p>"He's taken." Nodoka said sharply. "Don't even think of coming between him and Akane Tendo or Ukyo Kuonji."</p><p>"Akane Tendo and Ukyo who?" Makoto moved slightly away from Nodoka. "And he has tits?"</p><p>"I so detest that word." Nodoka said. "It makes them sound like a breakfast food." She smiled at Makoto's giggle. "Ukyo Kuonji. My son has two fiances, three if you count Shampoo, which I certainly don't. He favors Akane Tendo but his life right now precludes a traditional family."</p><p>Makoto shook her head as she tried to wrap her mind around what the older woman was telling her. 'Her son has two fiancées. Okay.' She drawled in thought. 'And he has tits.' She made a smacking sound with her lips. "Okay. Sure." She said aloud. "No problem he's taken." Makoto shook her head again. "And he has ti, boobies?"</p><p>"Only when he's a girl." Nodoka repeated. "Which is more often than I like but both Akane and Ukyo assure me that my son is more than manly enough." She giggled. "Apparently almost more than they can handle sometimes." She smiled proudly. "Anyway, you're going to have to take my word for it but he becomes a she." Nodoka walked over to the vanity and picked up a silver framed picture. "Here. This is my son. Ranma."</p><p>Makoto took the frame and looked at the picture. Actually it was two pictures. One a tall, muscular dark haired handsome man in his early twenties and the other a short, buxom redhaired woman of about the same age who was, in Makoto's opinion, drop dead gorgeous. "Well he's pretty hot I admit but who's the girl? Is that Akane or Ukyo?"</p><p>"No they're both Ranma." Nodoka replied. "And no I haven't missed any of my medications." Nodoka said in dry amusement. "He'll prove it to you if you meet him but for now take my word for it." Nodoka walked back to the vanity and picked up another framed picture. "This is Akane and Ukyo."</p><p>The picture showed two extremely atractive women hugging each other but facing the camera. Their cheeks touching and making a kissing expression with their mouths. "Akane is the one with the short black hair." Nodoka looked at the picture with a fond expression and put it back on the vanity along with the picture of Ranma. She turned to look at Makoto. "Well you look presentable enough." She said. There was the sound of a doorbell. "That must be Koko." Nodoka stood. "Now you wait here." Nodoka hurried off.</p><p>Makoto waited nervously for Mrs Saotome's return. "What have I got myself into?" She said to the empty room. "Crazy or not, if I can get a job working in a club." She snorted. "And maybe even meet the Black Widow." She said in near awe. "Wow." Makoto sat up straighter when she heard the sound of footsteps and low conversation approaching.</p><p>The woman that entered the room with Nodoka was probably at most in her early thirties. Pretty in a more mature way, though her features were marred by a slight distortion to the end of her mouth. Makoto looked at the woman's face more closely and thought she detected the faint outline of a scar along the woman's cheek. Makoto stood and bowed politely.</p><p>"Apparently she learns quickly as well." Nodoka murmurred. "Makoto this is Mrs. Koko Kobiashi."</p><p>"Call me Koko." The woman grinned. "So you're the new recruit." She said appraisingly. Koko tilted her head and pursed her lips. "I think you have an autumn complexion." She said. "Sit." Makoto sat.</p><p>Koko placed a small case , about the size of a lunch box, on the vanity and opened it. The insides telescoped out to display a good number of compartments, Koko select a jar and opened it. She also removed a large brush from the case. Koko walked over to Makoto and stated applying a foundation. "Nodoka tells me you're a young woman looking for a little excitement in her life?' She asked conversationally. Makoto nodded. "gotta boyfriend?"</p><p>"Not really." Makoto replied. "Not too many guys like tall girls." She said sourly.</p><p>She leaned back and examined Makoto critically. "I think we'll use some red in your eyeshadow." She said mostly to herself. "But you're okay with sex?" Koko asked almost in passing.</p><p>"I guess." Makoto replied. "Not that I've done it a lot, but yeah."</p><p>"Interesting." Murmurred Koko.</p><p>"Do you think her hair needs to be done?" Nodoka asked. She finished changing into a red toned floral evening kimono.</p><p>"Hey you look good." Makoto exclaimed. She felt great. For the first time in her life Makoto felt like she was being treated as an adult. And the transformation she saw reflected in the mirror made her look more adult than she ever had hoped or expected. 'Hell, I look hot.' She thought in glee.</p><p>"So do you." Nodoka replied. "Koko?"</p><p>"I don't have time to do it justice tonight." Koko said regretfully. "You have excellent hair but it really needs a style more than a trim." She shook her head.</p><p>"A French braid perhaps." Nodoka suggested. "Something simple."</p><p>"Hmmm." Murmurred Koko. "I can see why you suggested that." She nodded. "I guess that will work." Koko spun Makoto's chair around and quickly fashioned a braid and tied it off with a red ribon that she wove into the braid itself. "Nodoka also told me you're living at home." She said. "That must suck."</p><p>"Koko." Nodoka said reprovingly. "Language."</p><p>Koko grinned. "Sorry Auntie." She said. "I mean that must be uncomfortable." Her grin widened at the murmur of "better" that came from Nodoka. "Why haven't you moved out?"</p><p>"Got no job so I got no money." Makoto replied sourly. "I really need this job, Mrs. Saotome." She said to Nodoka. "I'll do just about anything to have my own life." She waved to her reflection in the mirror and then the clothes on her body. "I want to look like that all the time." She said. "I want to wear nice clothes." She exclaimed. "I don't care what I gotta do to get this job, Mrs. Saotome, but I promise you'll never regret it."</p><p>"We'll start you as a waitress tonight." Nodoka promised in return. "But so far I find your enthusiasm most commendable."</p><p>"We better get a move on." Said Koko. "Miki called and said she already had to reserve a dozen tables for the first show."</p><p>"Oh dear, and it is only Thursday." She said in realization. "Not as busy as the weekend but well no matter, Fumie will have to train you." Nodoka smiled smugly. "That'll keep both of you out of mischief."</p><p>"Look who's talking." Koko said knowingly. Koko gave Nodoka's outfit a critical look. "You know one day I should just do you up as a Geisha."</p><p>Nodoka blushed. "Now that you mention it." She said slowly.</p><p>"Tomorrow." Koko said. "You'll make a Friday night debut." Koko finished repacking her makeup. "Everyone ready?" She said. Nodoka grabbed a purse and nodded. To Makoto's surprise, Nodoka handed her a small purse as well.</p><p>"I noticed you didn't have one. All young ladies should carry a purse." Nodoka said amiably. "Shall we go?"</p><p>Makoto followed the two women to the door. To Makoto's amazement a limo was parked out front and waiting. She almost jumped into the car. "This is living." She said happily. "Who do I have to fuck to get this?"</p><p>"Language Makoto." Nodoka said sharply. "If you wish to be one of Kodachi's Girls you must keep a civil tongue in your head." She wagged a scolding finger. "Nor will you use such language in my presence ever again."</p><p>Makoto ducked her head. "Sorry Mrs. Saotome."</p><p>"Apology accepted." Nodoka said in satisfied tones. "However, to answer your question, that's up to you." Makoto turned in surprise and Nodoka captured her with a gaze. "Do you want to travel like this?" She asked. Makoto nodded. "However we are getting ahead of ourselves. Tonight we will see if you will be asked to return tomorrow night."</p><p>"What will I do?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"Tonight?" Koko answered instead. "Serve drinks mostly."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Serving drinks was exactly what Makoto ended up doing for most of the evening." She had met some of the staff. Too many names for Makoto to remember so she concentrated on those she had the most contact with. That being Mrs. Saotome, Koko and the waitress Fumie. Fumie, it seemed, knew everyone. Including most of the customers. "How do you do it?" Makoto asked during a short break. "Remember all those names, I mean."<p>"I dunno, practice I guess." Fumie replied. "Don't worry about it."</p><p>"I am worried." Makoto hissed back nervously. "I need this job." She said. "Look I live at home and it's killing me and my mom." Makoto looked at her shoes. "I have to get out of there."</p><p>"Girl, I hear ya." Fumie replied. "Moving out was the best move I made." She said. "My mom and I even get along now." She patted Makoto on the arm. "Look as far as I'm concerned you got the job."</p><p>"Thanks Fumie." Makoto said feelingly. "I just hope Mrs Saotome thinks so too." She shivered. "Man that woman is scary."</p><p>"Auntie?" Laughed Fumie. "Scary?" She shook her head. "As long as you don't curse or act like a slut in front of her you're fine." She snorted at the look on Makoto's face. "Which one did you do?" She asked.</p><p>"Both." Admitted Makoto.</p><p>"Ooh girl, she's gonna make you suffer." Fumie giggled. "Maybe I should keep my distance."</p><p>"Don't you dare." Makoto said in panic.</p><p>"Don't worry I wont." Fumie replied laughing. She looked up as she heard the door open. "Heads up." She told Makoto. "Speaking of Auntie."</p><p>"Ah Makoto, I'm glad I found you." Nodoka said as she approached. "I need you to deliver a bottle of Sake to the second floor." Nodoka shot a look at Fumie. Fumie just looked innocently at the ceiling. "Go to the kitchen and get the bottle." Nodoka ordered. "And see if they need anything else." She clapped her hands. "What are you waiting for?" She said. "Go." Makoto rushed away. She looked at Fumie. "Well?"</p><p>"Nasty trick Auntie. You have a gift." Fumie said approvingly. "I don't think she's really figured it out yet."</p><p>"Then it's time she did." Nodoka replied sternly. She gave Fumie a nod. "And thank you for the compliment."</p><p>"You're welcome Auntie." Fumie replied. "And to answer your question, I like her."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Makoto carried the tray and the bottle of hot sake in it's carrier to the designated room. She reached the door and knocked. A female voice responded from the room. "I have the Sake you ordered." She said through the closed door. "Come in." Responded the woman's voice. Makoto opened the door and carried the tray and sake into the room. "Where should." Makoto stopped. The woman on the bed was naked. So was the man lying next to her. Makoto swallowed nervously. "Where should I put this/" She squeaked out.</p><p>"Bring it over here." The woman said. "Where's the receipt?" She asked.</p><p>"Receipt?" Makoto said dumbly. "Oh yeah, that's right." Makoto fumbled in her apron. "Here it is." The woman on the bed nodded to the man. Makoto's eye's widened in understanding and she handed the receipt to the man to sign. "I think you keep the yellow copy." She looked at the woman again who nodded. The man signed the receipt and took the yellow copy and handed it back to Makoto. She licked dry lips. "Anything else?" She said with forced calm.</p><p>"Anything else baby?" The woman asked the man. He shook his head. The woman waved a hand at Makoto in dismissal.</p><p>Makoto backed out of the room slowly and then closed the door behind her. She leaned against the door and blew out a breath. "I didn't know they could be so big." She said in disbelief. After regaining her breath, she went back downstairs to the kitchen and handed over the receipt. "Have you seen Mrs. Saotome?" She asked in a tight voice. She was directed to the main office.</p><p>Makoto hurried to the office and knocked. "Mrs. Saotome?" She heard the older woman's voice. Makoto opened the door. "May I speak with you?"</p><p>Nodoka was sitting at Kodachi's desk. She held a cup of tea in one hand and was leaning comfortably against the back of the chair."Is something the matter Makoto?"</p><p>Makoto walked until she stood in front of the desk. Her hands were clasping each other and twisting nervously."Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know." Babbled Makoto. "Do you know what goes on, on the second floor?"</p><p>"I'm well aware of what goes on everywhere in this club." Nodoka replied with steel iin her voice. "Will it be a problem for you?" She asked with emphasis. Nodoka leaned back when Makoto shook her head. "But there is a problem." Nodoka questioned.</p><p>"Am I supposed to do, do that?" Stammered Makoto.</p><p>"Supposed to?" Nodoka asked. "No." She said firmly. "No one is forced to do anything." She said. "If that is your only concern, don't worry you won't be asked to entertain."</p><p>"Entertain?" Makoto echoed. "Is that what you call fu," Makoka broke off at the warning look in Nodoka's face. "Having sex?" She asked Nodoka. "Oh never mind, entertaining it is."</p><p>Nodoka let an approving smile come to her lips. "And it is entertaining." Nodoka added. "In both senses of the word." Nodoka leaned back. "Ms Kuno, and that's what you will call her if she decides to keep you on, Ms. Kuno will not have it any other way."</p><p>"But it would be better for me if I did?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"Financially, yes." Admitted Nodoka. "And that doesn't include other fringe benefits." Nodoka smiled wryly. "The limo for one. Any girl who goes on an outcall is driven to and from the client." Nodoka informed her. "A minor point I admit but some of the girls appreciate it."</p><p>"I didn't mean that." Makoto replied. "Doesn't my job depend on it?" She asked.</p><p>"Oh heavens no." Nodoka smiled reassuringly. "We truly do need a waitress." She said emphatically. "However only the working girls are eligible for a certain set of perks and, I'm afraid, Ms. Kuno is unyielding about it."</p><p>"Like the limo." Makoto said slowly.</p><p>"That's one, yes." Nodoka replied. "You will find that Kodachi is generous in terms of salary. Even as only a waitress you should still be able to afford to share an apartment with someone." Nodoka added. "Though most of the working girls do that anyway." Nodoka tapped her lower lip with a manicured finger. "I understand one of the girls, Miki, is looking for a roommate." There was a knock on the door. "Enter." She called. The door opened and Ami walked in. "Yes Ami?"</p><p>"A line of credit for you to approve, Auntie." The blond said. She walked over with a bound folder. "Mr Ichi, Auntie." She said and placed the folder in front of Nodoka. "He wants a half million yen line." She said. "We ran a credit check." She informed Nodoka. "He's good for it."</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka picked up a pen. "Oh Ami, have you met Makoto?"</p><p>"Hey." Ami chirped. "You're the new girl."</p><p>"We haven't quite decided." Nodoka informed Ami. "I fear Makoto has some reservations." She handed the folder back to Ami. "Give Mr. Ichi a drink on the house." She said.</p><p>"Of course Auntie." Ami replied. She looked at Makoto. "Reservations?" She said to Makoto.</p><p>Makoto shrugged. "Do you," She shot a quick glance at Nodoka. "Do you entertain here?"</p><p>"Oh heck yeah." Ami said cheerfully. "I got a string of five regulars already." She leaned closer to Makoto. "What's the matter don't you like sex?"</p><p>"Actually Makoto is applying for a waitress position." Nodoka said. "She wouldn't be required to entertain."</p><p>"No?" Ami said in some disbelief. "Too bad, I think you'd be very popular." She said. "Oh well, we do need another waitress." She bowed to Nodoka. "I better get Mr Ichi his money." She said. "Nice meeting you Makoto."</p><p>"Nice meeting you. Ami." Makoto replied hesitantly. Makoto watched the young woman walk out of the office. Makoto slowly turned her head back to Nodoka. "She's nice."</p><p>"Oh Ami is a very sweet girl." Nodoka said in approval. "But I must warn you she is a terrible gossip."</p><p>Makoto looked back at the door. "Five regulars?" She said almost under her breath.</p><p>"What I believe you refer to as a 'booty call.' " Nodoka explained. "With the added inducement of being paid." Nodoka smiled slightly. "Most of the girls have at least a couple regulars."</p><p>"Mrs. Saotome?"</p><p>"Yes dear?" Nodoka replied.</p><p>"Do you think I'd be popular?" Makoto blushed slightly.</p><p>"I think you'd be very popular." Nodoka replied. "But we're getting ahead of ourselves." She said. "The position being offered is waitress. Whether you have the qualities necessary to be one of Kodachi's girls is something Kodachi will have to decide." She raised a finger. "Is that understood?"</p><p>Makoto nodded. "Yes Mrs Saotome." Makoto stood. "I guess I'd better get back to work." She said. "Thank you for talking to me Mrs Saotome."</p><p>"My pleasure Makoto." Nodoka said approvingly. "Oh and Makoto." She waited until the girl looked up. "You may call me Auntie."</p><p>Makoto smiled. "Thank you Auntie."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The dressing room was packed with girls changing out of clothes, changing into street clothes or waiting for a turn at the showers. Makoto had already showered and was just finished getting dressed. She started slightly as a couple girls pointedly sat down next to her. One was Ami. The other, Makoto blushed redly, the other was the girl from the upstairs room. "Hi." She squeaked.<p>"Hey." The girl replied. "We haven't been introduced. "I'm Aoi." She said. She waved a hand at Ami. "You've already met my cousin." She said. "How was your first night?"</p><p>"Different." Makoto admitted.</p><p>"Sorry about before." Aoi said contritely. 'Toshiro is a bit of an exhibitionist." She explained. "Dangling the lure as he keeps saying." She giggled.</p><p>Makoto joined Aoi in giggling. "Lure hell." She replied. "It was the whole damn rod." She exclaimed. Makoto let out a relieved sigh. "I'm glad it was his idea and not yours." She said thankfully. "Though come to think on it." Makoto stopped suddenly and looked at the door. "Auntie." She said. "Ooh. She got me good."</p><p>"Probably testing you." Ami opined. "And since you're calling her Auntie I guess that means you passed." Ami smiled. "Welcome aboard." Ami stood. "Hey everyone, Makoto is staying." There was a sudden rush and Makoto found herself the center of attention. "Stand up Makoto." Mokoto stood nervously. "Say something." Ami urged.</p><p>"Hi?" Makoto hazarded. There was an acknowledging and friendly chuckle. "I hope we'll all be friends."</p><p>The door to the dressing room opened and Nodoka walked in. Nodoka nodded in satisfaction where the girls were clustered around Makoto. "I see you've all already met our newest girl." She smiled. "Excellent." She looked around. "Ah Miki." She said to a slim brunette, "are you still looking for a roommate?"</p><p>Miki nodded. "Yes Auntie." She looked at Makoto. "You?" Makoto nodded. "Sure why not?" Miki said agreeably. "The rooms are kinda small but the view is great."</p><p>"Do I have to share a room?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"No." Miki replied.</p><p>"I'll take it." Makoto replied to some understanding laughter. Suddenly Makoto frowned. "Wait a minute." She said. "I just started this job, I don't have any money yet."</p><p>"I think Ms Kuno will approve an advance against your salary." Nodoka said calmly. "In fact, I'm sure of it."</p><p>"But Auntie." Makoto protested. "I just started." She explained. "And Ms Kuno hasn't even met me." She stopped when Miki tapped her arm. Makoto looked at Miki inquiringly.</p><p>"Don't worry about it." Miki said. "If Auntie likes you then Ms Kuno will like you." She explained. "Besides, we really do need more girls here." She looped her arm through Makoto's. "Hey I have a great idea." She exclaimed. "Move in tonight."</p><p>"Tonight?" Squeaked Makoto. "I can't. All I have to wear is what I have on." She said. "And besides my Mom is expecting me to come home." She looked at her watch. "Oh shit."</p><p>"Language Makoto." Nodoka scolded. "while I understand the sentiment, such language is not tolerated while you are here."</p><p>"Sorry Auntie." Makoto said contritely.</p><p>"You're forgiven." Nodoka said. "As for your mother, I've already explained to her that you would most likely stay somewhere else tonight." She said calmly. "As for clothing. Miki?"</p><p>"I have a few things that'll fit you." Miki said to Makota. "Anything else you can get later."</p><p>"Take her shopping tomorrow." Nodoka said to Miki. "Within reason Miki." She said with a slight sigh. "No more than one hundred thousand yen."</p><p>"A hundred thousand yen?" Makoto exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>"Not enough?" Nodoka asked cooly.</p><p>"Are you kidding?" Makoto said. "I don't think I've spent that much in my life, total." Makoto licked dry lips and bowed deeply. "Auntie, thank you." She gushed.</p><p>Nodoka nodded regally. "Now hurry and get ready, all of you." She clapped her hands briskly. "The limos are leaving in ten minutes." With that Nodoka sailed out of the room.</p><p>"Limos?" Makoto asked Miki.</p><p>"Shuttle service." Miki grinned. "For those who don't have their own transportation." Her grin dimpled. "Lucky for you, I have my own car." She shouldered a bag. "You got everything?" She asked impishly.</p><p>"Funny." Makoto said dryly. "Yeah, let's go." She turned to Aoi and Ami. "Later guys and thanks." She waved to the rest of the girls and followed Miki out of the club. The walk to the car was nonexistant as it was parked just behind the club. Makota whistled in appreciation when she saw the car. "Nice." She declared. The car was red, fast looking and new. "Very nice."</p><p>"Thanks." Miki pressed a button on her keychain to unlock the door. "Get in."</p><p>Makoto almost jumped into the car. She looked around then inhaled. "Gods they're right, new cars do smell different." She leaned back in the seat and wiggled. "This is living." She said as the car drove away. She looked out the window as Miki drove the car expertly through the narrow streets. "I've never lived on my own before." Makoto said quietly.</p><p>Miki gave Makoto a quick glance. "Don't worry kid." She said reassuringly. "Auntie wouldn't have asked me to take you in if she didn't think you were okay." Miki said. "She likes you, you know."</p><p>Makoto nodded. "I don't know why though." She said. "She just met me today." She blew out a breath. "I can't believe I woke up this morning thinking today was going to be just another dull, boring day." She heard Miki chuckle. "Miki?"</p><p>"Hmm?" Miki responded as they drove along.</p><p>"What's it like?" She asked in a quiet voice.</p><p>"What's what like?" Miki asked.</p><p>"Being, being." Makoto stammered. "Doing what you do?"</p><p>"What? Being a whore?" Miki asked easily. She drove the car around a corner and into a parking lot. "We're here." She parked the car and she and Makoto exited. "As far as jobs go," Miki said answering Makoto's question. "Being a whore isn't too bad." She led Makoto into a mid sized apartment building. They entered the elevator. "The money's good. The people are pretty nice and I get all the cock I can eat." Makoto joined Miki in giggling. "Why? You interested?"</p><p>"I don't know." Admitted Makoto. "I mean, I really haven't had a lot of experience, I don't know." The elevator door opened and Makoto followed Miki down the hallway. "I mean it's not something your guidance counselor would recommend as a career."</p><p>Miki laughed. "Solve a lot of problems if they did." Miki said in amusement. They reached a door and Miki took out a key and opened the door. They entered. Miki turned on the lights.</p><p>"Wow!" Makoto exclaimed. "This place is bigger than my folks apartment." She said in awe. "Wow." She exclaimed again.</p><p>Miki grinned and walked over to the coffee table and opened what looked like a humidor. She pulled out something and held it up. "You smoke?" She asked. Makoto looked at the joint Miki held and nodded. "Cool." Miki lit the joint and took a deep toke then passed it to Makoto.</p><p>Makoto took a toke and held it before letting the smoke escape from her nose. "Ooh nice." She passed the joint back to Miki.</p><p>"Here let me show you your room." She said and led Makoto to a door. Miki opened the door and waved Makoto in. "Like I said, the room is kind of small." She said in apology.</p><p>"Small?" Makoto said in disbelief. "I share a room this size with my sister." Makoto walked into the room and after a moment spotted the rolled up futon against the wall. "This is perfect." She said happily. "Thanks Miki." Miki grinned and passed the joint back to Makoto.</p><p>"No problem kid." Miki replied. "Let me show you the rest of the apartment. "That'll take all of five minutes." Miki and Makoto left the bedroom. "Here's the bathroom." She said. "Kitchen over there and my room is here." She said. She opened the door. Makoto followed Miki into the bedroom. It was larger than Makoto's but seemed smaller because of the amount of stuff Miki had. Pictures filled the walls and books filled two shelves and it appeared that every flat surface was occupied by stuffed animals. Instead of a futon, Miki had a queen size bed that dominated the room. Miki sat on the bed. "That thing still lit?" She patted the bed next to her.</p><p>Makoto sat and handed the joint back to Miki. Makoto looked around the room. "It feels homey." She said at last. "And not at all what I expected." She said. "I mean, it's so normal." She blushed. "You're all so normal."</p><p>Miki laughed. "I wouldn't go that far." She said with a smile. "It's funny, Auntie said pretty much the same thing when she first met us." She said. "She's an amazing woman Auntie." Miki said in admiration. "She really doesn't like what we do, you know." She stated. "But she, well Auntie cares about us." Miki looked at the stub of the joint in her hand. "You want any more?" She asked.</p><p>"I'm good." Makoto replied.</p><p>Miki nodded and stubbed out the roach. "You sleepy yet?" Miki asked.</p><p>"I think I'm still too wired to sleep yet." Makoto replied. "So much has happened today." She sighed. "Auntie says I don't have to, you know."</p><p>Miki shrugged. "You don't." She said. "Look Makoto, none of us have to entertain." She stopped as Makoto snorted. "What?"</p><p>"You say it too." Makoto said. She wiggled two fingers on each hand. "Entertain."</p><p>Miki grinned wryly. "Well fucking is such a coarse word." She said in a very Nodoka like tone. "And it really doesn't do what we do justice." Miki pursed her lips and shrugged. "Ms Kuno is the same way." She waved a hand. "It's kind of funny." Miki said. "We're whores but the two of them expect us to act, not like ladies exactly, the closest description I could give you is Geisha."</p><p>"Geisha?" Makoto said in disbelief.</p><p>"Geisha." Affirmed Miki. "Only updated a bit." She smiled wryly. "If you decide you want to," She grinned. "Entertain, then it's only fair to warn you of some perks that come with the job."</p><p>"Warn me?" Makoto asked.</p><p>Miki nodded. "Koko will do your hair and your makeup." She stated. "Good isn't she?" Makoto nodded. "Well besides Koko, there is Madam Demille, Ms. Kuno's deportment teacher. You'll see her if Ms Kuno is dissatisfied with your behavior and trust me you'll see her. You'll hate it at first." Miki raised a hand and started ticking off items. "Plus Ms. Kuno insists we work out at least twice a week. The only exceptions are the dancers." She said. "Like me."</p><p>"You were so great." Makoto gushed. "I'd never have the nerve to do that."</p><p>"Thanks but if you want to see great, you'll go see    U.S.A. at the Kabuki." Miki replied modestly. "Noriko was pretty damn good too." Miki said proudly. "That's Ms. Mata to you. Understand?" Makoto nodded. "Look if we're gonna talk, let's at least get comfortable." She pointed to a dresser. "Top drawer." She directed. "Toss me whatever's on top."</p><p>Makoto walked over to the dresser and opened it. She chuckled. "Flannel." She looked around the stuff animal filled room. "Figures." She pulled out a pair and tossed it to Miki and took out a second pair for herself. Suddenly Makoto yawned. "Whoa." She said. "I guess I'm getting sleepy."</p><p>Miki patted the bed. "The bed's big." She said. "And I'm getting sleepy too." She quickly stripped down and put on the pajamas. "Good thing we showered before we left."</p><p>"Yeah." Makoto got into her own pajamas and jumped on the bed. She yawned again.</p><p>"Get in." Miki directed. She shifted over in the bed. Makoto got in. "You don't seem to concerned about sleeping in the same bed with another woman." Miki commented.</p><p>"Slept with my sister all the time." Makoto said sleepily. "Kinda used to it."</p><p>"Yeah, me too." Miki replied. "Why don't we go to sleep? We can talk more tomorrow."</p><p>Makota yawned. "Good idea."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Mokoto woke to an empty bed and the smell of coffee. "Wha?" She mumbled sleepily. She sat up in the bed and looked around. "Oh yeah."Makoto threw back the covers and scrambled out of bed. Yawning she walked out of the bedroom and followed her nose to the kitchen. Miki looked up from a newspaper.</p><p>"Morning sleepy head." Miki said. "Coffees on the counter and there's some rice in the cooker."</p><p>Makoto nodded sleepily and walked to the counter. A cup of coffee and a bowl of rice and Makoto felt herself coming more awake. "What time is it?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"Just before noon." Miki said. "We got a lot to do today." She iinformed the younger woman. "Clothes shopping for you and we need some groceries."</p><p>Makoto nodded. "I should call my mom and let her know I'm okay." She said. Makoto spotted a phone on the wall. "You mind?" She said waving to the phone.</p><p>Miki waved a hand. "Go ahead."</p><p>Makoto with coffee cup in hand went over to the phone. "Hello, Ryoko? What are you doing home? Oh. Okay, is mom around?" Makoto cupped the mouthpiece with her hand. "That girl gets the worst periods." She uncovered the mouthpiece. "Mom?" She pulled the phone away from her ear. "Calm down mom." Makoto said into the phone. "I thought Aun, Mrs. Saotome spoke to you." Makoto rolled her eyes. "Then what are you yelling about? I'm fine. I'm fine. I stayed with one of my, um, coworkers. Her name is Miki and she's really nice." Makoto nodded. "Mom, mom listen." Makoto said. "It isn't official yet, but I think I got the job." Makoto chewed her lower lip. "Well Ms. Kuno has the final decision and she's out of town." She said. "I'm working tonight." Makoto took a breath. "Mom, I'm moving out."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Makoto and Miki walked into the club. "Oh crap my second day and I'm already late." Grumbled Makoto. She was carrying a shopping bag in one hand.</p><p>"Don't worry about it." Miki said easily. "If you have to you can blame it on me." She nodded with her head. "Here comes Auntie now."</p><p>"Oh crap. Oh crap. Oh crap." Makoto mumbled under her breath.</p><p>"Good afternoon Ladies." Nodoka said as she approached.</p><p>"Good afternoon Auntie." Chorused Miki and Makoto. "I'm so sorry I'm late." Continued Makoto. "But." She stopped at Nodoka's raised hand.</p><p>"No need. No need." Nodoka said. "I anticipated you being delayed." She said. "I did tell you to go shopping." She looked at Miki. "You did get receipts?" She asked. Nodoka gave Makoto's current outfit, jeans and a blue midriff baring top a critical look. "That color suits you." She said. "But I don't think it's appropriate for tonight." She looked at the bag Makoto carried and raised an eyebrow. "Well let's see what else you bought." She waved a hand. "Come with me."</p><p>To Makoto's surprise she led them to Kodachi's office. She opened the door and waved them in. Waiting in a chair and sipping tea was Koko. Koko greeted the women cheerfully. Koko stood and walked over to Makoto. "Good." She said after a moment. "You only put on foundation."</p><p>"Miki said I should." Makoto replied. "I." She was stopped by Nodoka.</p><p>"Miki was correct." Nodoka said. "Thank you Miki." She exchanged a glance with Miki, the other woman nodded slightly. "Now let's see what you will wear tonight." She said. She picked up the shopping bag. "No you sit down Makoto and let Koko do your face." She started looking through the shopping bag. "I presume you tried on everything." She asked.</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Makoto replied. "Miki made sure." Koko started applying her skills to Makoto's face which served to silence her.</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka started removing articles of clothing. "Now this is a darling blouse." She carried it over to Makoto. "This particular shade of blue suits you."</p><p>"There's a matching skirt Auntie." Miki pointed out. She walked over to Makoto and watched critically as the makeup was applied. "She has good cheekbones doesn't she?"</p><p>Koko nodded. "Very good." She said as she continued applying makeup. "There." She said in satisfaction. She held up a mirror. "Here, tell me what you think."</p><p>Makoto looked into the small mirror. The woman who stared back was her yet not. The face that stared back was older, more sophisticated, sexier. "Ohh my." She breathed. "Thank you Koko." She said feelingly.</p><p>"Yes indeed." Nodoka agreed. She clapped her hands together sharply. "Now come over here and get dressed." She ordered.</p><p>Makoto jumped to her feet. "Yes Auntie." She said. Makoto looked around for a moment then shrugged and started removing the clothes she was wearing until she was down to her underwear.</p><p>"Stop." Nodoka ordered. She shook her head. "Next time please make sure the bra and panties match." She said. "Just because no one can see does not mean you don't coordinate." She said. "Details dear, details."</p><p>Makoto nodded. "Yes Auntie." She put on the blouse and skirt. She saw that Nodoka had also selected her shoes from the two pairs she brought. The heels Miki insisted she buy. Makoto licked her lips. "Don't you think I'm tall enough as it is Auntie?" She said hesitantly.</p><p>"Nonsense dear." Nodoka said firmly. "You have beautiful long legs, you must show them off." She tapped her lips with a finger. "Don't you think so Miki?"</p><p>"Definitely Auntie." Miki agreed cheerfully. "That's why I picked that skirt." She nodded. "You're looking hot Makoto."</p><p>"Do you really think so Miki?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"You're going to have men lining up just to talk to you." Predicted Miki. She looked at her watch. "Uh oh, I'd better get changed." She said. "If you'll excuse me Auntie, Koko?"</p><p>"Run along dear." Nodoka replied. "There are a few things I need to discuss with Makoto before she starts work."</p><p>"Later kid." Miki said to Makoto. With a wave she walked out of the office.</p><p>Nodoka looked at Makoto critically."Stand up." She ordered. Makoto quickly go to her feet. "Now walk." Makoto gave Nodoka a questioning look. "I want to see the effect." Makoto shrugged and walked slowly toward the door. "Now back." Ordered Nodoka. Makoto walked back toward Nodoka. "Excellent." Nodoka said. "You have a natural grace."</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Makoto replied.</p><p>"You're welcome dear." Nodoka said. "Now let me see you smile." She nodded when Makoto smiled. "Not too broadly dear. Try to project a sense of inner amusement." She nodded again. "Much better." Nodoko walked around Makoto. "Now remember, you are here to serve drinks. That's all."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Makoto replied.</p><p>Nodoka did not miss the slight note of disappointment in the younger woman's voice."That does not mean you ignore our clients." Nodoka continued. "Smile, listen and laugh." She said. "Above all, smile." Nodoka walked over and started fussing with Makoto's hair. "Smiles bring tips."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Makoto replied. "Auntie?"</p><p>"Yes dear?" Nodoka straightened Makoto's collar.</p><p>"What if?" Makoto licked her lips. "What if a, a someone asks me to, um entertain?"</p><p>"If by chance that were to occur you will see me or Koko immediately." Nodoka replied. "We will explain the situation to them." She smiled. "Any other questions?"</p><p>"No auntie." Makoto replied.</p><p>"Good." Nodoka made a last infinitesmal adjustment to Makoto's blouse. "Now remember smile." She said. "Run along dear." With a quick bow Makoto walked quickly out of the office.</p><p>"What do you want to bet she's propositioned within an hour?" Koko asked when the door closed.</p><p>"As Nabiki might say, that would be a foolish bet. No doubt there will be many offers." Nodoka replied. "But I believe we should wait."</p><p>"What for?" Koko asked. "The highest bidder?"</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "Actually yes." She replied. "She needs to know her worth." Nodoka smiled. "Now I believe it's my turn for you to work you magic on." Nodoka said. She walked to a closet and pulled out a suit bag. "What do you think?" Nadoka unzipped the bag to reveal an pale green kimono with light pink and gold accents. "Do you think my boys will like it?"</p><p>Koko snorted in amusement. "Your boys." Koko grinned. "Oh they'll like it alright, but they'll like you better out of it." Her giggle was joined by Nodoka's. "Now sit down."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Makoto hurried to the bar with her latest order. "A large bottle of sake and two  Kirin's Sami." She placed her tray on the bar and sat on a vacant stool. "Man it's busy." She said to the bartender.</p><p>"That's why we needed another waitress." The bartender replied as he placed two large bottles of beer and removed the sake from a microwave under the counter. "How you holding up?"</p><p>"I'm doing okay." Makoto replied with satisfaction evident in her voice. She picked up the tray and balanced it on her shoulder. "See you in a bit." Makoto walked back with her order. Makoto was very pleased with herself. Not only was she keeping up but she was getting some sizable tips. Especially when she smiled. Nor was Makoto unaware of the speculative and interested looks on the faces of many of the men in the club. She placed the drinks on the table and smiled.</p><p>"You're new here, aren't you?" One of the men at the table said.</p><p>"Yes sir." Makoto smiled. "Just started yesterday."</p><p>"See I told you she was new." The man said to another. He leaned back in his chair. "What's your name?"</p><p>"Makoto sir." Makoto replied still smiling.</p><p>"Makoto." The man said almost to himself. "Pretty name for a pretty girl."</p><p>"Thank you sir." Makoro flushed at the compliment. "Did you want anything else sir?" She asked.</p><p>The man nodded. "Yeah, how about going upstairs with me?" He gave Makoto a hungry look.</p><p>Makoto flushed even redder. "I'-I'm sorry sir but I'm just a waitress." She cursed herself for stammering. "But if you're looking for company I'm sure one of the other girls," She stopped when the man shook his head. "Sir?"</p><p>"Don't be like that." The man said almost petulantly. "I know all you girls work here."</p><p>"Really sir, I'm not allowed." Protested Makoto.</p><p>"Is there a problem?" A voice said from behind Makoto.</p><p>Makoto turned. "Oh Koko." Makoto said with a touch of relief. "No, no problem." She said hurriedly. "I was just explaining to this gentlemen that I'm only a waitress and, and." She stopped at Koko's raised hand. "Koko?"</p><p>"It's allright Makoto." Koko said reassuringly. "Why don't you run along?" She said. "No wait." Koko said suddenly. "Why don't you go see Auntie?" The way she said it could only be interpreted as an order. "It's okay, really." She waved her hands. "Go." Makoto nodded and hurried away.</p><p>Koko waited until Makoto was out of sight before she turned her attention back to the man. "Hey Hirohito."</p><p>"How are you Koko?" The man, Hirohito replied.</p><p>"Good." She said."Real good." She smiled. "You have excellent taste, as always." She nodded toward where Makoto had gone.</p><p>"What's the deal Koko?" Hirohito asked curiously. "All the girls work."</p><p>"Well not all but most." Admitted Koko slowly. "And possibly Makoto will as well." She smiled. "She may have to be convinced though."</p><p>Hirohito nodded in understanding. "Virgin?" He asked.</p><p>"Unfortunately, no." Koko replied reluctantly. "But as best as we can tell she's only had a single lover." She informed Hirohito. "And apparently not that often."</p><p>"Really?" Hirohito said in very interested tones. "And she'll be charging how much?" He asked questioningly. Koko just smiled wider and didn't answer. "I see." He licked his lips. "I'm interested." He said.</p><p>"Excellent." Koko replied. "Please see Mrs. Saotome or myself before you leave."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Makoto approached the office door hesitantly. She knocked quickly. "It's Makoto, Auntie." Makoto said through the door. "Koko said I should see you." She heard Nodoka tell her to come in through the door. Makoto opened the door and entered. "I hope you're not mad at," Makoto stopped. "Auntie!" Exclaimed Makoto. "You, you look womderful." She gushed.<p>Nodoka sat in a chair positioned, thronelike, in front of the desk. She was wearing the elegant kimono she had brought, unlike the kimomo she had worn before this kimono was long enough to almost form a train, the sleeves too were long and billowy. The collar wide and it exposed and framed Nodoka's neck and shoulders. Her hair had been elaborately braided and piled high on her head with tasseled hair pins holding her locks in place. It was her face that took Makoto's breath away. Nodoka's face seemed to have been cast from porcelin and her lips colored to form a small bow.</p><p>"Thank you Makoto." Nodoka said regally. "Pllease tell me what happened."</p><p>Makoto looked at her shoes. "I was serving a table and, and this man." Began Makoto.</p><p>"Client Makoto," Corrected Nodoka. "Everyone who comes here is a client."</p><p>"Client." Makoto nodded. "Well this client, he," Makoto flushed. "He wanted me to go upstairs with him Auntie. I tried explaining that I wasn't allowed to do that, that I was only a waitress, but I don't think he believed me. " She said nervously. "Then Koko showed up." She  looked up hesitantly. "I tried to explain Auntie, really I did."</p><p>"It's alright Makoto." Nodoka replied soothingly. "You did nothing wrong." She pointed to a chair near her. "Sit." Makoto sat. "Did he offer any money?" Nodoka asked. Makoto shook her head. "That's good." Nodoka tilted her head. The tassels swaying with the movement of her head. "If, and it still is if, if it is decided that you will entertain, then we can discuss what your services will command, but we get ahead of ourselves once again." Nodoka said with a slight sigh. Then Nodoka smiled. "Do you really think I look alright?" She asked.</p><p>Makoto nodded rapidly. "You look like a princess out of a fairy tale." Makoto gushed.</p><p>Nodoka kept her face calm in order to preserve the makeup. "Thank you Makoto." Nodoka looked up at a knock. "Please see who that is Makoto."</p><p>Makoto stood. "Yes Auntie." Makoto went to the door and opened it. Two men barely older than her were standing at the door. "Yes?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"Is Miss Nodoka here?" One of the men asked anxiously. "She wasn't in her booth."</p><p>"Is that you Jiro?" Nodoka asked from inside the room.</p><p>"Yes Miss Nodoka." Jiro said in relief. "And Daisuke is here with me."</p><p>"Please admit them Makoto dear." Nodoka ordered almost imperiously.</p><p>Makoto stepped aside and waved the two young men in. To Makoto's surprise, and hidden annoyance, they barely glanced at her as they hurried into the office. The two young men stopped suddenly as they saw Nodoka. "Miss Nodoka." The two young men breathed in unison.</p><p>Nodoka rose gracefully to her feet and walked over to the two stunned men. "Now that you're here, you can escort me to my table." She looped her arms through theirs. "Makoto." Nodoka said. "Please have some Sake brought to the table."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Makoto bowed and walked out of the office.</p><p>Nodoka's passage through the club was marked by the sounds of exclamation and surprise from the clientelle. Makoto hurried to the bar and ordered sake. "Hurry up." Makoto said urgently. "It's for Auntie."</p><p>"Relax Makoto." The bartender said. "By the time Mrs. Saotome gets to her table the Sake will be ready."</p><p>Makoto turned as Fumie ran up to the bar. "Did you see her?" Fumie asked excitedly. "I mean I've heard her threaten to do it before but I never expected." She sighed. "She looks so beautiful."</p><p>Makoto nodded. "I don't think I could pull it off." Makoto said enviously. "Hey Fumie, you know everyone." She asked hesitantly. "There two guys with Auntie?"</p><p>"Ah you mean Jiro and Daisuke." Fumie giggled. "Cute aren't they?" She waved a scolding finger teasingly at Makoto. "Hands off, those are Auntie's boys." She giggled again. "Or should I say boy toys."</p><p>"Auntie?" Makoto said in disbelief. "You're kidding."</p><p>"Nope." Fumie looked into the club and saw Nodoka reach the private booth. "Better get the Sake over there."</p><p>Makoto nodded and picked up the tray with the warmed Sake and hurried over to the private booth. "Your Sake Auntie." Makoto said.</p><p>"Thank you Makoto." Nodoka replied regally. "Please close the curtain before you leave."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Makoto placed the sake on the table and then fumbled with the curtain for a moment before it dropped into place. The curtain hadn't even dropped before she noticed one of the two men begin kissing Nodoka's bare shoulders. She returned to the bar. Fumie was still there.</p><p>"Auntie is all settled?" Fumie asked. Makoto nodded. "You closed the curtain?" Makoto nodded again. "Good." Fumie said. "Now listen, if a fat, baldheaded guy comes into the club looking for Auntie you tell him she's busy and can't be disturbed." Fumie said seriously. "Is that understood." Makoto nodded again. "Then you tell me or Koko right away so we can arrange," Fumie grinned. "A distraction."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The nights seemed to rush by and, despite the change in her sleeping habits, Makoto was beginning to adjust to her new routine. Every night she'd work until closing, go home with Miki and sleep late. Sometimes she and Miki would just laze around until they had to work, other times they'd go shopping or go to a local gym to work out.</p><p>It was the following Tuesday night and Makoto and Miki entered the club. The club always efficiently busy seemed to have an added busyness to it. As she entered she saw Auntie Nodoka hurrying over. "Oh Makoto, Miki I'm glad you're here." Nodoka said. "Kodachi and Noriko have returned and Kodachi is anxious to meet you."</p><p>"Kodachi?" Makoto asked. "The Black Widow?"</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "Indeed." She said. "Now come along both of you." She turned and walked back to the office. After a moment of hesitation Makoto and Miki followed.</p><p>"Relax Makoto." Miki said reassuringly. "I'm sure everything will be fine."</p><p>They reached the office and Nodoka waved them in and followed them into the office. Nodoka closed the door behind them. "Well here she is." Nodoka announced. "Makoto may I introduce Kodachi Kuno and Noriko Mata."</p><p>Mokota stood very still as the two woman at the desk turned their attention toward her. The Black Widow was dressed all in black and wore a veil. The slender brunette next to her gave Makoto a penetrating look. The brunette walked over.</p><p>"So you're Makoto." Noriko said pleasantly. "I don't think Nodoka's description did you justice." She said. "You're very pretty."</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Mata." Makoto said nervously.</p><p>"Have you enjoyed working here?" Noriko asked.</p><p>"Yes Ms. Mata." Makoto replied. "Everyone has been very kind."</p><p>"I have explained the arrangement to Kodachi and Noriko." Nodoka said. "And they feel inclined to make your position permanent."</p><p>"Oh thank you." Makoto said in relief.</p><p>"There is just one concern." Nodoka continued.</p><p>"Let me." Kodachi interrupted. "And before you say anything, everyone has been very happy you're here." Kodachi watched as Makoto blew out a relieved sigh. Kodachi smiled behind her veil. "However I have heard that you've been," Kodachi paused for a moment as she select a word. "Approached." She said finally. "It's going to happen again, will that be a problem?"</p><p>"Oh no Ms Kuno." Makoto said fervently.</p><p>"We wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable." Kodachi added.</p><p>"No. No. It's fine Ms. Kuno." Makoto assured Kodachi. "It, it didn't make me uncomfortable, not really."</p><p>"Not really?" Questioned Noriko. "You were either uncomfortable or not."</p><p>"I wasn't." Makoto said quickly. "I was, I was." Suddenly Makoto blushed redly. "I think I liked the attention." She said quietly. "I thought guys didn't like tall girls." Makoto said almost to herself. If anything Makoto blushed deeper. "They follow me with their eyes."</p><p>"Turns you on, doesn't it?" Noriko asked. Makoto nodded. "Okay girl, we're at the moment of truth." Noriko said. "Do you think you can do what Miki does?" She asked. "And what nearly every other girl in this place does." She pointed out.</p><p>Makoto looked at her shoes. The high heels Miki insisted she buy. She looked at Miki. "Miki?"</p><p>"It's up to you kid." Miki said. "Just so you know, no one will think less of you if you don't." She said. "We all like you kid."</p><p>"Yeah?" Mokoto asked. Miki nodded. "I'm not very experienced." Admitted Makoto.</p><p>"Tell us something we don't know." Miki said in amusement. "That will come," She grinned. "With experience." She waved a dismissive hand. "No one expects you to perform like a porn star, you know." She said. "Heck half the guys that come in here are just happy there is a girl who's willing to talk to them."</p><p>Mokoto looked down at her shoes again. She was silent for a long time then she nodded hesitantly. "I-I," She stopped and licked her dry lips. "Yes." She whispered. She looked up at Kodachi. "Yes." She said in a louder voice. To her surprise Kodachi lifted her veil and returned Makoto's gaze.</p><p>"Noriko." Kodachi said without taking her eyes off of Makoto. "Make an appointment for Makoto with Dr. Ono." She said.</p><p>Noriki pulled out her notebook and made a couple of notes. "Of course Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Auntie has brought to my attention that several of our clients have expressed great interest in you Makoto." Kodachi informed the young woman.</p><p>"Really?" Makoto said in surprise.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "Several have gone so far as to place a sizable deposit with us in the hopes you'd consider him." She said. "We've narrowed down the list to three potential clients." Kodachi continued. "You may choose one of them or reject them all if you wish."</p><p>"I can?" Makoto said in disbelief.</p><p>Kodachi nodded firmly. "You can." Kodachi said. "You will always have that choice." Kodachi lowered her veil. "All three will be here tonight." She said. "They will have a red rose on their table. If any are acceptable, you will take the rose."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Makoto made her rounds in a state of heightened awareness. Every noise, every smell seemed magnified. 'Calm down.' She told herself. So far she hadn't seen anyone with a rose on their table. She saw three men sit down at a table and she hurried over. "Good evening gentlemen." Makoto said pleasantly and smiled. The three men smiled back. "What can I get for you?" She asked. She gave the table a quick glance. No roses.<p>"Bring us a big bottle of Kirin." One of the men said.</p><p>Makoto nodded and hurried back to the bar and placed her order. To her delight Miki was sitting at the bar. "Hey Miki."</p><p>"Hey kid." Miki replied. "Your secret admirers show up yet?"</p><p>"No." Makoto said in a combination of relief and annoyance.</p><p>"Nervous?" Miki asked.</p><p>"Scared." Makoto admitted. "What if I do something wrong?"</p><p>"Trust me, you'll be fine." She nodded toward the bottle on the tray. "Better get that to the table before it gets warm;"</p><p>Makoto nodded. "Yeah." She picked up her tray and carried the bottle and three glasses back to the table. "Your beer gentlemen." Makoto's voice trailed off. Each of the men had a long stemmed rose in front of them. Makoto swayed on her feet for a moment and would have dropped the tray if one of the men hadn't caught it. Makoto shook herself and placed her tray on the table. "S-sorry." Makoto murmurred.</p><p>"Why don't you sit down?" One of the men said. He indicated the lone empty chair at the table. Makoto sat stunned. "Let me introduce myself. I'm Tenchi Koizumi." He said in a thick baritone. He was a thickset man in his late thirties of average height but seemed to radiate authority and strength.</p><p>"Kojiro Matsuro." The second man introduced himself. He was tall, slim with deepset eyes in a narrow face. He seemed to be the youngest of the three and the best looking.</p><p>"Genji Morimoto." The third man said. He was the oldest of the three, a dignified looking man in his late forties. "And you're Makoto." He smiled. "It appears we are the finalists." He said in amusement to the other two men. He turned back to Makoto."So pretty Makoto, how do I get you to choose me?"</p><p>Makoto looked at the three men. Each was attractive to Makoto in different ways but attractive nonetheless. 'They want me to choose.' She thought in amazement. Makoto looked at the three roses. She looked at Genji. "Do you really think I'm pretty?" She asked. Genji raised an eyebrow and nodded. "W-why don't you each tell me a little about yourselves?" She said hesitantly. "Maybe then I could choose." Remembering Nodoka's admonition Makoto placed a smile on her lips.</p><p>"An excellent idea." Kojiro rumbled. "But talking is such thirsty work." He chuckled.</p><p>Makoto flushed. "Oh where are my manners?" She said. She picked up the bottle and then placed the three glasses in front of her and poured drinks for the three men. "You'll have to forgive me, I'm new at this." She flushed when the three men chuckled.</p><p>"It's alright pretty lady." Kojiro said. "That's part of your charm." He waved his hands at Tenchi and Genji. "If that wasn't true we wouldn't be here." His face screwed up. "No, we'd be here but we wouldn't be here." He said. "Did that make sense?" Makoto giggled. Kojiro smiled triumphantly.</p><p>Makoto found herself chatting comfortably with the three men. Kojiro was funny. Tenchi radiated an awesome self confidence. And Genji was erudite and sophisticated. And each was becoming more attractive to Makoto by the minute. "Oh I thought talking would help but now it's even more difficult to choose." Makoto said at one point. "I would feel terrible hurting any of you." For some reason that seemed to encite the three men to further competition.</p><p>Makoto looked up as three people approached the table. She paled and jumped to her feet. "Ms. Kuno." She bowed quickly.</p><p>"Please return to your seat Makoto." Kodachi said calmly. She waited until Makoto had returned to her seat. "Gentlemen." Kodachi greeted the three men who had also stood and bowed politely to Kodachi and then bowed again to the two women who were with her. Noriko Mata and Nodoka Saotome. "I just came by to say hello." She raised a hand and a waitress ran over with a bucket and a stand. The waitress, Makoto was relieved to see it was Fumie, quickly placed the bucket on the stand. "My Brother suddenly came across an interesting item recently and I thought I'd share it with you." She waved to the bucket. "Compliments of the house."</p><p>Nodoka walked over to Makoto and started stroking the woman's hair. "I see you haven't chosen yet." She said to Makoto.</p><p>"It's so difficult Auntie." Makoto replied. "They're all so nice." She turned in her seat. "Which one would you choose Auntie? For me I mean." Makoto suddenly became aware of the silence that fell at Makoto's words.</p><p>"Well if it were me," Nodoka blushed suddenly. "No I don't think that would work." Nodoka sighed. "I'm sorry my dear but you'll just have to choose on your own."</p><p>"But I like all of them Auntie." Makoto said. She turned back to face Tenshi, Kojiro and Genji. "Really I do." She said. "I just know that my first time will be wonderful no matter who I pick." She said into the silence that again descended.</p><p>"I will double my offer." Genji said quietly.</p><p>"Now gentlemen we already agreed." Began Kodachi.</p><p>"Triple." Kojiro said cutting Kodachi off. "And she goes with me for the weekend."</p><p>"Now gentlemen, we never said," Kodachi tried again.</p><p>"Triple my offer," Genji said. "For the weekend of course." He looked at Makoto. "Tell me pretty Makoto have you ever been to Sapporo?" He said. "I know a very quaint, very private inn just outside the city."</p><p>"If it's the one I'm thinking of." Noriko said, shaking her head in amazement. "I'd count it in his favor." She said to Makoto.</p><p>"Really?" Makoto asked. Noriko nodded.</p><p>"We could be there in less than three hours." Genji said enticingly.</p><p>"Oh that sounds wonderful." Makoto said with a sigh. "But Genji I wasn't expecting to go out of town." She leaned closer her hand touched the stem of his rose. "And what if you were disappointed in me?"</p><p>"I doubt that would be possible." Genji said. He seemed to hold his breath as Makoto's fingers closed around the stem. "After." He breathed. "I'll take you to Sapporo after. I'll buy you a whole new wardrobe."</p><p>Makoto picked up the rose to the accompaniment of groans from Tenchi and Kojiro. Genji rose from his seat and extended his hand to Makoto. When she took it he lifted her to her feet. Makoto suppressed a giggle when she realized that she was nearly a head taller than Genji. Genji for his part seemed to regard her height as something to be admired. Suddenly Makoto ran over to Nodoka and hugged the older woman. "Auntie?"</p><p>"You will be fine dear." Nodoka said gently. "Just be yourself." She hugged Makoto. "And personally I think you made an excellent choice." She said quietly. "Enjoy your weekend my dear."</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Makoto replied. "For everything." She hugged Nodoka again and walked back over to Genji. She bowed to the men at the table and then to Kodachi. Kodachi returned the bow. "Okay I'm ready." She said to Genji.</p><p>Kodachi watched Makoto and Genji walked off toward the stairway to the second floor. "The room is ready?" She asked quietly.</p><p>"Yes Ms Kuno."Noriko confirmed.</p><p>"Excellent." Kodachi turned to the two remaining men at the table who were also following the progress of Makoto and Genji to the stairs. "I'm sorry gentlemen but it appears Mokota has chosen." Kodachi informed the men. "I will of course return your deposits."</p><p>"Don't bother." Tenchi replied. "With your permission I would like to take Makoto away next weekend."</p><p>"Well of course that's up to Makoto but I believe she would be amenable to such an arrangement." She turned to the last member. "And you?"</p><p>Kojiro waved a hand in a shrug. "On one condition, no one else."</p><p>Kodacahi raised an eyebrow behind her veil. "I think that can be arranged as well." Kodachi agreed."Now please," She waved a hand toward the wine bucket. "Please enjoy." She smiled. "A poor consolation I admit but at the moment the best I can do."</p><p>"Well if Ami is free." Tenchi said inquiringly.</p><p>Kodachi smiled. "She will be." She promised. She looked at the other man. He nodded. "Wonderful." Kodachi said.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Makoto led Genji to the second floor in silence. Her heart beat so loudly she was amazed that Genji hadn't commented on it. Upon reaching the second floor she saw Miki waiting for them. Miki smiled but didn't say anything. She just waved a hand and led Makoto and Genji to a room. Miki opened the door and waved them in. Makoto breathed in a gasp. The room was dimly lit but light enough to see that there were what appeared to be rose petals on the bed.<p>"Now, if you need anything." Miki said to Makoto. "Here is the call button." She indicated a box on a low table next to the rose petaled bed. Miki turned and gave Makoto a reassuring smile. She turned to Genji. "Ms. Kuno has informed me that you may have the room as long as you'd like."</p><p>"Tell her thank you for me." Genji replied. "Now if you'll excuse us."</p><p>"Of course sir." Miki bowed to Genji and gave Makoto another reassuring smile. She backed out of the room and closed the door behind her.</p><p>Makoto turned to Genji. Genji was loosening his tie. "Let me." Makoto said hesitantly. She walked over to Genji and helped him remove his jacket and tie. She looked at the bed and swallowed nervously. Instead Makoto led Genji to a large, overstuffed chair and had the older man sat down. To Genji's surprise Makoto curled up on his lap. "I really hope you won't be disappointed with me." Makoto said quietly. "I'm really not that experienced."</p><p>"I won't be." Genji assured her. He started stroking Makoto's hair.</p><p>"You're going to have to teach me, you know." Makoto said with a shaky laugh.</p><p>"I know." Genji replied.</p><p>Makoto looked into Genji's eyes. "Then teach me Genji." Makoto said fervently. "Teach me how to make love to you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Miki looked up when she heard someone inserting a key into the lock and open the door. She put down the magazine she was reading and stood. Makoto opened the door and walked in. She was dragging a new suitcase behind her. "Welcome home Makoto." Miki said in greeting. "How was your weekend?"<p>"Good." Makoto replied in a quiet voice. "Genji was very sweet." She indicated the suitcase. "And very generous." Makoto sighed.</p><p>"You okay kid?" Miki asked in concern.</p><p>Makoto shrugged. "Yeah, I think so." She replied. "Miki?"</p><p>"Yeah kid?" Miki replied.</p><p>"When did you know I was going to, to." Makoto broke off and looked down.</p><p>"Entertain?" Miki asked. Makoto nodded. "Honestly? I think I knew the first day you walked in." She replied. Miki walked over to Makoto. She lifted Makoto's chin with her hand. "I really knew when you came home with me that same night." She said. "You reminded me of me." She continued. "I was the same way, hungry for excitement, for adventure, for fun and scared out of my mind." Miki put an arm around Makoto's waist and led her into the apartment. "Let me make you some tea."</p><p>"Miki?" Makoto said.</p><p>"Yeah kid?"</p><p>"I'm a whore." Makoto declared quietly.</p><p>"No Makoto." Miki replied to Makoto's surprise. "You're better than a whore." She stated. "You're one of Ms. Kuno's girls."</p><p>Author's Notes: A little something suggested by my readers.</p>
