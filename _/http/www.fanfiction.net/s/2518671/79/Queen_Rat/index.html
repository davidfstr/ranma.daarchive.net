</div><p>Chapter 5</p><p>'Party Girls'</p><p>Evening fell on Tokyo and with the closing of the day the omnipresent neon started flickering into life signaling the start of another weekend. Neon signs appeared over all the major and minor night spots of Tokyo. All but the most exclusive, that is. Exclusivity meant not having to advertise their presence and no club was more exclusive and thus more subdued at night than the nightsport known simply as 'The Club' or to those with longer memories, 'Ky's Cafe American'. Oh there were lights, spot lights cleaved the sky and the entrance of the club was well lit but no name glowed in neon above the entrance. If you had to ask, you probably didin't belong.</p><p>The ever present paparazzi were on high alert. Years of following the rich, famous and powerful had honed their senses to a fine edge and one and all agreed, something was...up. Limousines pulled up to the curb, one after another, to disgorge their storied passengers. Cameras flashed and the photographers shoved and jostled each other for the best pictures possible. One limo's passenger door opened and a familiar trio emerged. The massive frame and trademark kilt of legendary street fighter and MMA champion Ryoga Hibiki was unmistakable and the orange hair of one of the women on his arm alerted everyone to the presence of supermodel Ting Li. The other...woman...was not a woman but Japan's most famous and notorious transvestite, Konatsu Kanzen. The three posed for the cameras before entering the club.</p><p>Limo after limo pulled up and each set of passengers prompted greater and greater frenzied flashes. One paparazi, a veteran of many years, shook his head. "All that's missing are the Kunos." Another limo pulled up, disgorging a group of six. "Oops, spoke too soon." He said excitedly.</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno exited the limo and reached in a hand to escort first an attractive and regal looking woman with her hair in a helmet cut. She wore a black gown with white and silver embroidery that brought to mind a hard frozen landscape. He then escorted an attractive blond also wearing a black and silver gown though the silver-white pattern was more reminiscent of a field of snow. Again Tatewaki reached his hand in and escorted out a young girl of twelve or so. The young girl wore a tartan skirt and pink blouse under a tartan patterned coat.</p><p>"Well, well, Kiko Kuno." The paparazzi said as he raised his camera. "This will look great in the teen section." He said as he began snapping pictures.</p><p>Another pair exited the limo. The paparazi all seemed to scratch their heads in unison. The woman was known, she was after all Kiko Kuno's biological mother but the man was a complete unknown. They took pictures anyway.</p><p>Hiro leaned over to Koko. "Is it always like this?" He asked self-consciously. "What am I supposed to do?" He asked.</p><p>"Smile and pose." Koko said cheerfully. She put her hand on Hiro's shoulder and smiled at a camera. "Like this." She squeezed Hiro's shoulder. "Smile." She said. Hiro smiled. Koko kissed Hiro on the cheek as the cameras flashed.</p><p>"I can understand them taking pictures of you, you're beautiful." Hiro protested. "But..." He was interrupted by a quick kiss from Koko. The cameras flashed.</p><p>"That was pretty smooth, Uncle Hiro." Kiko giggled. "Better get used to it.." Kiko said. "You're dating one of Ms. Kuno's girls." She pointed out.</p><p>"Speaking of which." Koko said. "We'd better go in,." She said somewhat reluctantly. "I do have some work to do."</p><p>"Wait a moment." Kiko said. She took her mother's hand and then one of Hiro's. "Smile." She said. The cameras flashed. Kiko dropped the hands she was holding and walked over to one of the paparzzi. "Could you please send a copy of a picture of the three of us to the Kuno Mansion?" She asked politely.</p><p>The photographer smiled. "Sure, Miss Kuno." He said. "You mind telling me who he is?" He nodded toward Hiro.</p><p>Kiko smiled widely. "Hiroichi Kiyuo" She replied. "And there's a good chance he's going to be my step-father." she said. "So spell it right."</p><p>Even before Koko took a single step into the inner club, Nodoka was rushing over to her. "Oh Koko, thank heavens you're here." She said. "I know I promised you'd only have to do Pema and Kagomi if necessary but something's come up." She linked her arm through Koko's. "I promise I'll have her back in no time, Mr. Kiyuo." She said to Hiro. Nodoka led Koko away leaving Hiro standing motionless in their wake.</p><p>Hiro felt a hand slip into his. He looked over to see Kiko smiling at him. "Don't worry, Uncle Hiro, she'll be back." She giggled. "Tell you what, you can be my date until Mom comes back."</p><p>Hiro smiled widely in response. "I think I'd like that, Kiko." He extended his arm. "Shall we?"</p><p>Kiko grinned and took Hiro's arm. "Let's." She replied.</p><p>Koko was looking behind her helplessly as Nodoka led her away. She smiled when she saw Kiko take hold of Hiro's arm. "Thank you, Baby." She said under her breath. She turned to Nodoka. "So, what's the emergency?"</p><p>"Oh, no emergency." Nodoka said with a laugh. "Just a bit of fun." She said. They reached the door to the elevator. They opened the door and entered the elevator. "I did as much as I could, but I need you to finish it properly."</p><p>"Auntie." Koko said in amused reproving tones. "What have you done now?"</p><p>"Chisako Tamasayo and Nagisa Yamada." Nodoka said in explanation. The elevator stopped on the second floor and Nodoka led Koko to Ms. Kuno's Girls suite. "Originally I was going to have them wear masks but..." She opened the door and walked in. "Sorry to have kept you waiting ladies, but..ladies may I present both mine and Ms. Kuno's personal cosmetician, Koko." She said dramatically. "I begged her to attend to your faces personally and she has, graciously, agreed."</p><p>Koko repressed a giggle at both the expressions on the two womens faces and the fact that they two matrons were in their underwear but with the first layer of makeup already on their faces. Two elegant Kimono were hanging on individual stands next to the the chairs of each of the women. Koko spread her hands apart gracefully. "Ladies, a pleasure to meet you." She said. "Shall we begin?" She smiled as Chisako and Nagisa squealed excitedly.</p><p>"I'll check on our Crown Jewels." Nodoka said. "Ladies, I leave you in Koko's more than capable hands." Chisako and Nagisa squealed in response.</p><p>Nodoka left the suite and took the elevator to the third floor. She entered one suite to be met with music playing on the sound system and the sight of Kagomi and Pema in the middle of the main room standing side by side and dancing in place in time to the music. Nodoka just watched them for a moment. 'They are genuinely happy.' She thought in mild surprise. She let them dance some more before she cleared her throat. "Ladies." She said when she got their attention.</p><p>"Auntie." Chorused Pema and Kagomi. They struck poses. "How do we look?" Kagomi asked.</p><p>Nodoka this time gave the two young women a more critical examination. Both were wearing short mid-thigh iridescent dresses that showed plenty of shapely arms and legs and enough bosom to be interesting but not sluttish. As Nodoka expected when it came to these two young women, Pema was wearing a dress in shades of green and Kagomi was wearing a dress in shades of peach and orange. Usually the girls would wear something that had shades that reflected the other girl's colors but, at first, Nodoka could not spot it, when she did, she smiled. Pema was wearing a jewel between her eyebrows as she normally did, as did Kagomi, usually it was in their signature color but this time they had reversed it. "Straighten your stockings, the both of you." She tapped her lower lip with a manicured finger. "I see Genvieve's touch." She said in appreciation. "Sexy yet sophisticated."</p><p>"Thank you, Auntie." Chorused Pema and Kagomi.</p><p>"Koko has arrived but has a small project to attend to." Nodoka said in explanation. "I don't think she will be too long." Nodoka smiled.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki, Lord Kuno, surveyed the club from the comfort of one of the private booths scattered around the club. He had already been recognized and greeted by several of his more important, and legitimate, associates. Based on even the short conversations he had had, it was apparent that their being here was not unusual. If anything, it was Tatewaki's presence, along with Nabiki and Kimi, that elicited the greater surprise.</p><p>What was not a surprise, at least to Tatewaki, was that the club boasted an impressive wine list and the items on the extensive menu was most promising. "My gods." He said in shocked amusement. "My Sister must have raided the wine celler."</p><p>"No doubt." Nabiki said in her own amused tones. Nabiki looked around and even before she could raise a hand, one of the hostesses, a redhead, hurried over..</p><p>"How may I help you, Lady Kuno?' The woman asked.</p><p>"I was just wondering if Ms. Kuno had arrived yet." Nabiki replied.</p><p>The redhead laughed quietly. "Sometimes it's more of a question if she's gone home." She said. "If it wasn't for Noriko and..." She nodded toward Kiko. "Miss Kiko, I think she's sleep here if she could."</p><p>"Auntie works too hard, sometimes." Kiko piped up. "Hi Suki."</p><p>"Hi honey." Suki replied. "Got a new boyfriend, I see." Nodding toward Hiroichi Kiyuo.</p><p>Kiko giggled. "Just keeping him warm for Mom.' She replied. "Suki, this is Hiroichi Kiyuo." She said. "I call him Uncle Hiro." She said. "He's really nice."</p><p>"So I've heard." Suki said. "A pleasure to meet you Mr. Kiyuo." She turned back to Nabiki. "I believe Ms. Kuno is occupied at the moment, should I let her know you wished to see her?" Suki asked in tones that seemed slightly challenging.</p><p>Nabiki smiled her best Ice Queen smile and shook her head. "Not if it means interrupting her." She said. "But hopefully she will find time for her..." Nabiki paused. "Her other family." She finished.</p><p>"I'm sure she will, Lady Kuno." Suki replied confidently. "If you will excuse me?" She bowed and walked away.</p><p>"You know if you could bottle whatever Kodachi uses to inspire such loyalty, you'd rule the world." Kimi commented in amused tones. "You may scare people into following you, Nabs, but you'll never get them to love you...not like that."</p><p>"I have you two, don't I?" Nabiki said archly. "Who else do I need?"</p><p>Tatewaki smiled fondly. "My Lady does us great honor." Tatewaki replied. "I have need for nought else in this life..yet." Tatewaki paused. "I am hesitant to..." Tatewaki stopped as Nabiki placed a gentle hand over his mouth.</p><p>Nabiki leaned closer and removed her hand. "Yes, my love." She said. "You..." She smiled. "And the Kuno, will have their heir." Her smile became slightly evil. "If it takes both myself and Lady Kimi to do it."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka Saotome, in full Geisha attire and makeup, walked regally into the main club. Right on her heels were two women. They too were dressed as Geisha. If it wasn't for the makeup it would have been obvious they were blushing redly. As it was they giggled and tittered almost uncontrollably as they followed Nodoka through the club.</p><p>"Oh I feel so..naughty." One of the trailing Geisha giggled to the other.</p><p>"I know." The other agreed with a responding giggle. "Gods, I feel twenty again."</p><p>Nodoka smiled in amusement at the chatter from the two women. Chisako Tamasayo and Nagisa Yamada had jumped at the chance to play Geisha as Nodoka was sure they would. 'Inside every proper woman, is an improper woman trying to get out.' She thought. She led them to her private booth where two young men were already seated. "Good evening boys." She greeted the two young men who stood as they approached. "Ladies, these are my two boys, Jiro and Daisuke." She said in introduction. "Boys, this is Ume and Sakura, please keep them company until I return." she said. "Treat them as you would treat me."</p><p>Daisuke and Jiro smiled widely. "Of course, Miss Nodoka." Jiro replied for the two of them. Nodoka gave the two men a wink and then walked away. The two young men waved the two middle aged women into the booth. Once the women were seated Jiro and Daisuke sat down as well, flanking the two women, much to the two women's excited embarrassment. They sat so close that the two women could feel the heat coming off Jiro and Daisuke's bodies. The two women pulled out fans and started fanning themselves.</p><p>"Miss Nodoka called you her boys." Chisako ventured. "Are you related?" She asked nervously.</p><p>Jiro and Daisuke laughed. "No." Daisuke replied. "We're her...companions." He explained.</p><p>"Companions?" Echoed Nagisa questioningly. "Oh, you mean like you accompany her when she goes shopping?"</p><p>"That too." Daisuke replied with a smile. "But usually we just help her...relax." Daisuke shook his head. "It's amazing how tense she gets." He grinned. "Sometimes Jiro and I have to spend...hours on her."</p><p>"Hours?" Squeaked Chisako.</p><p>"Both of you?" Nagaisa asked in a tiny voice. When Jiro and Daisuke nodded the two women fanned themselves even harder.</p><p>"You know, you two seem a little tense yourselves." Jiro commented.</p><p>"We're fine." Chorused Chisako and Nagia in unison. They fanned themselves faster.</p><p>"Are you sure?" Jiro asked. "Miss Nodoka did say to treat you the way we'd treat her." He said in a warm voice. "She'd be very disappointed with us if we didn't." He smiled. "I know, how about a nice shoulder massage." He reached around Chisako's shoulders and started rubbing gently. "Tsk." He said. "I was right, tense."</p><p>"This is terribly improper." Began Nagisa when Daisuke started rubbing her shoulders as well. She closed her eyes. "But, gods, that feels good."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka walked around the room greeting guests. Her first stop was a booth that contained her son, Ranma, and Akane and Ukyo. "Ranma, my son." She said in greeting.</p><p>"Hey Mom." Ranma said in greeting. "Man the place is packed." He said after giving his mother a hug.</p><p>"Well, of course." Nodoka said in satisfaction. "Our clients have been looking forward to this day for years." She said. "There are going to be a number of very...disappointed men tonight." She said in resigned tones. "It's a good thing I was able to borrow a number of... young ladies from some of the other clubs." She said. "Just to soothe those disappointements away." She gave Ranma a quick kiss. "Now I really must go." She said."There's still so much to do." She explained.</p><p>"I still get final say." Ranma said seriously.</p><p>"Of course you do, my son." Nodoka said. "But I truly believe you will find Chouji and Naoki more than satisfactory."</p><p>"Those the twins?" Akane asked.</p><p>Nodoka shook her head. "After some consideration I felt the twins would not do." She said. "No, I was referring to Chouji Tamasayo and Naoki Yamada." Nodoka explained. "The...curious cousins." She said. "I am quite sure that Jewel and Gem will be pleased as well." She said. "Now, I really do have to go." Nodoka gave Ranma another quick kiss on the cheek and sailed off.</p><p>Nodoka's next stop was another private booth. In the booth were two young men, both in their early twenties. Nodoka hid a smile. 'Very satisfactory, indeed.' She thought. Both men were tall, athletic and masculinely handsome. "Mr. Tamasayo. Mr. Yamada." Nodoka greeted the two young men. "I'm so happy you are here."</p><p>"Miss Nodoka." Chorused the two young men in respectful greeting.</p><p>"Oh, please, don't get up." Nodoka said as the two men began to rise. Nodoka sat down."I can't tell you how pleased I am that you've decided participate in our little...tradition." She smiled. "I think you'll find that it was a wise decision." She gave the two young men a critical look. The two were wearing very similar apparel. Tan slacks, a dark sports jacket over a blue shirt. The top two buttons of their shirts were unbuttoned. The two men were clean shaven and it was apparent that they had both had recent haircuts. Nodoka glanced down at the young men's hands. Clean and manicured. She nodded. "You'll do." She said. "Now remember, all the bids mean, at the moment, is that you wish to meet them."</p><p>"Meet them?" Chouji Tamasayo asked.</p><p>"Meet them." Nodoka replied. "I'm sure I know what you've heard but that is not the whole truth." She said. "No, young man, that is not the whole truth indeed." She nodded. "Oh you may have had some...contact with some of the other girls but all that meant was that they liked you." She said. "You should feel complimented." Nodoka leaned forward and steepled her fingers in front of her. "What you paid for...was a date." She said. "What you do on your date is no one's business." She said. "It certainly isn't mine." Nodoka leaned back against the chair. "Now, as to the girls tonight." She said.</p><p>"Jewel and Gem." Naoki said. He and Chouji looked at each other for a second. They turned to Nodoko. Naoki waved his hands vaguely. "Who..?"</p><p>Nodoka laughed. "That's up to you." She said. "What Jewel and Gem want...and deserve...are two gentlemen who will treat them well, and by that I mean, you are expected to take them places where they will be seen; dancing, movies, theatre, oh especially the theatre." She said. "You've read the papers, you've seen their names, you know who they are." She pointed out. The two men nodded. "And aren't they worth it?" She asked. "If you do that and pay the fee of course, then gentlemen, I promise you, you will be the envy of Japan."</p><p>The two young men looked at each other for a moment. "That sounds great and everything but, what makes you think they'll choose us?" Chouji asked.</p><p>Nodoka smiled. "You both went to Tokyo University, both graduated near the top of your class, so both of your parents' were more than happy to give you a greater share of responsibility in running the family businesses. Your futures are bright." She said. "And both Miki and Ami," She smiled a little wider as the two men flushed slightly. "Were as impressed with your personalities...as they were with your pillow skills." She leaned forward again. "For you see, gentlemen, as much as Gem and Jewel deserve recognition for who they are, we believe that you..." She said in emphasis. "Deserve recognition for who you are and will be." She nodded. "Lord and Lady Kuno are here tonight." She said. "And they are most interested in meeting whomever they pick." She leaned back again. "As I said gentlemen, what you heard was not the whole truth, not the whole truth at all."</p><p>"The bids?" Naoki asked.</p><p>"They are sufficient." Nodoka replied. "Though giving your companions an allowance is encouraged." Nodoka said. "About half the bid per week is the norm." She said. "But remember one thing gentlemen, whether anything comes from tonight's meeting is totally up to the girls." She said. "So I would recommend being as charming as possible." She smiled and stood. "I must go, it was a pleasure speaking to two such fine young men."</p><p>Naoki and Chouji stood and bowed. Nodoka smiled and turned and walked away. Naoki and Chouji sat and looked at each other again. "Did that sound the way I thought that sounded?"</p><p>"Which part?" Asked Naoki. "The unspoken promise that we're going to sleep with the two hottest girls in Japan or the unspoken threat that we'd better treat them good, um, or else?" He said. "The fucking Ice Queen for pity's sake."</p><p>"Yeah, that's what I got too." Chouji replied. "Damn weird way to get a girlfriend." Chouji mused.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka walked back through the club and toward her private booth. The privacy curtain had been drawn and Nodoka hid a smile. "That's my boys." She said quietly. "Hello." She said in a louder voice. "I'm back." Nodoka quickly opened the privacy curtain, walked through and closed it behind her. "Do forgive me, ladies." She said. Chisato and Nagisa quickly sat up from where they were...resting against the broad chests of Daisuke and Jiro. From the disheveled nature of the fronts of the two women's kimonos, it was apparent that the two women had been almost completely seduced. Just as Nodoka had instructed her boys to do.</p><p>"Oh, Miss Nodoka, we, I, I mean." Begain Nagisa.</p><p>"There is no need to explain, Ume." Nodoka said. "I assume my boys have been satisfactory company while I was gone."</p><p>"Oh, oh yes, satisfactory." Chisako replied quickly. "Most...most satisfactory." She straightened the front of her kimono. "Very...friendly."</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka said easily Nodoka gave Daisuke and Jiro a slight nod of of her head.</p><p>"If you two lovely ladies will excuse us?" Daisuke said. He and Jiro smiled warmly at Chisako and Nagisa. "We have to attend to a few things."</p><p>"P-please hurry back." Chisako said quickly. "I mean..." She blushed.</p><p>"You'll hardly know we were gone." Promised Jiro. They stood and eased past the two women. They both kissed Nodoka on the cheek before walking two women gave Nodoka very jealous looks.</p><p>"So manly." Chisako said in dreamy tones.</p><p>"So...bold." Nagisa added with a sigh.</p><p>Nodoka feigned a sigh. "You know, I must thank you." She said to the two women. "It's so rare they get to meet sophisticated women such as yourselves." She sighed again. "Sometimes I fear they'll get bored just being with me." She said woefully. Nodoka smiled. "Though I'm quite sure they'll be extra attentive later." She laughed gently. "If only because they'll be thinking of you."</p><p>Chisako and Nagisa giggled. "I truly doubt that'." Nagisa replied. She sighed. "But it would be nice to believe they would think of us." She sighed again. "For a moment I felt, well not like a teenager, but, well you know." She shook her head. "It's so unfair." She pouted. "Men can always find some young thing but..." She said in tones that dripped experience. She looked off toward where Daisuke and Jiro had walked off. "It's so unfair."</p><p>Nodoka hid another smile. "Life can be unfair sometimes." She agreed. "But sometimes the scales do balance." She said. "My boys appreciate the charms of a, shall we say, mature woman." She raised a hand and giggled behind the hand. "Some of the girls here do sometimes get a little...jealous because of that."</p><p>"Gods, I'd love someone to be jealous of me." Griped Nagisa. "If only for a moment." She again looked off to where Daisuke and Jiro had gone. "If only..." She sighed.</p><p>Nodoka nodded slightly. "There is always...possibilities." Nodoka said idly. "And opportunities." She said. "For those willing to be...daring."</p><p>"Daring?" Nagisa asked.</p><p>"Daring." Confirmed Nodoka."Suppose...now I'm just speaking hypothetically, you understand." Nodoka continued. "But suppose if one were daring one might, what was that you said?" Nodoka said. "Oh yes, if one were daring one might inspire a little...jealousy." She said. "If only for a moment?" She leaned forward. "Now suppose that were possible." She smiled. "If there's one thing I've learned being Miss Nodoka, is that there are endless possibilities."</p><p>"Is it possible to get..." Nagisa blushed as she nodded toward where Daisuke and Jiro had gone. "Something like that?"</p><p>"Nagisa!" Scolded Chisako. "I can't believe you said that." She said coldly. "Thinking it, is one thing, saying it is another." She held an affronted pose for a few moments then collapsed into giggles. "Did I just say that?" She shook her head and sighed. "You are one lucky woman, Miss Nodoka." She said. "I love my Husband but..." She shook her head again. She looked down at the table. "Is it?" She asked in a tiny voice.</p><p>"As I said, my friends, and you are my friends, there are endless possibilities." Nodoka replied. "And since you are my friends, I will confide in you a litle secret." She beckoned with her hands and Chisako and Nagisa leaned forward. "My boys are obviously taken with you." Nodoka said in confiding tones. Nodoka smiled as the two womens' mouths dropped open. "Well, as much as I enjoy having others be jealous of me, I find that I myself am not a jealous woman." She said. "If my boys wish to spend a little time with some of my friends, well as I said, I myself am not a jealous woman."</p><p>"But...I...we really couldn't." Chisako began.</p><p>"Of course I am still speaking hypothetically." Interrupted Nodoka. She reached into the bodice of her kimono and extracted a card. "My boys are very discreet." She handed the card to Chisako. "Now, I really must leave again." She smiled. "So much left to do." Nodoka stood. "ladies." She said. Nodoka left the booth and closed the privacy curtain behind her. She didn't have to walk too far to find Daisuke and Jiro. "Boys." She said in greeting. "Remember, they still need to meet Gem and Jewel but afterwards..." She said. "The Ice Queen considers an alliance with their Husbands... beneficial."</p><p>Jiro and Daisuke nodded in understanding. "Don't worry, Miss Nodoka." Jiro said. "We know what to do."</p><p>Nodoka chuckled. "Of that I am fully aware." She said. "I hope you don't think too badly of me, but we do need..."</p><p>"Jiro and I know what's needed...and why." Daisuke said. "You know we will do anything for you."</p><p>"Such good boys." Nodoka said. "Still, I hope I can make it up to you."</p><p>Daiksuke and Jiro chuckled. "You always do, Miss Nodoka." Daisuke replied. "Will you watch the video?" He asked.</p><p>"Only if you promise to make it...interesting." Nodoka replied with a smile. "Now, go." She said. "There are two women waiting, impatiently no doubt, for your return." Nodoka smiled at the retreating backs of Jiro and Daisuke. "Such good boys." She repeated. Nodoka sighed and started walking through the club, She had not gotten far when Suki ran up.</p><p>"Goof evening, Auntie." Suki said in greeting. "I know you're busy." She said apologetically. "But...he's here."</p><p>"He didn't call did he?" Nodoka said in exasperation. "Honestly, Genma gets worse each day." She shook her head. "Are you expecting any of your other gentlemen?"</p><p>"Mr. Nagoya, Auntie." Suki replied.</p><p>"Hmm." Nodoka mused. "Mr. Nagoya, Mr. Nagoya...oh yes, I remember." She said. "The school girl fetish."</p><p>"Yes, Auntie." Suki replied with a smile. "I thought I could have the new girl, Misumi, take Mr. Nagoya tonight." She said. "But, I thought I should clear it with you first."</p><p>Nodoka tapped her lips with a finger. "Have you discussed this with Misumi?" She asked.</p><p>"I asked if she would be willing, but that's all." Suki replied.</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "Make sure you write up a voucher for the difference both for Mr. Nagoya and for what Genma should be paying you ." Nodoka said. "I will approve it." She said. "I'm continually impressed with you, Suki." Nodoka said. "especially with your willingness to deal with that husband of mine."</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Suki replied in grateful tones. Her hand went and caressed the spider pendant around her neck.</p><p>"No, thank you." Nodoka replied. "For...many things." She said. "Now, I really must go."</p><p>"Of course, Auntie." Suki said.</p><p>Nodoka continued her walk through the club finally reaching a large private table. "Good evening." She said. "Lord and Lady Kuno." She said "It's so good to see you and, of course, Lady Kimi." She bowed. "Good evening, Koko. Hiro." She greeted the new couple. "Kiko." She frowned. "I expected Kodachi to be with you."</p><p>Kiko rolled her eyes. "You know how busy Auntie gets." She said.</p><p>"Yes, I do." Agreed Nodoka. "But she's neglecting her guests. Kiko be a dear and see if you can get your Aunt to join us."</p><p>"Okay..." She grinned. "Miss Nodoka."</p><p>"Don't be impertinent, young lady." Nodoka replied with a twinkle in her eye. "Now scat." With a giggle Kiko skipped away. "They grow so fast." She sighed. Nodoka sat down. Nodoka eyed the glasses of water in front of Nabiki and Kimi. "Not drinking, I see." She said.</p><p>"We're taking a break, Auntie." Kimi replied easily. "Nice crowd." She said.</p><p>"Well of course, the two most eligible women in Japan are having their official debut." Nodoka replied. "So to speak." She said. "The bidding is sure to be ferocious." She said with a touch of amusement. Nodoka smiled. "I've already advised the winners that you will wish to speak to them."</p><p>"Auntie, Auntie, Auntie." Kimi said in mock horror. "Are you saying the contest is...rigged." She laughed. "So, it will be Tomosayo and Yamada then?"</p><p>"Well the final say remains in the hands of Gem and Jewel but I believe they can be easily swayed to, at the very least, consider the two young men." Nodoka replied. "It really shouldn't be all that difficult, the young men are handsome and wealthy, after all." She smiled in satisfaction.</p><p>"Excellent." Nabiki said.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sumire sat at her vanity applying her violet makeup. At her elbow and draped over a form was the mask she was going to wear tonight. Another of Koko's creations. If was violet, of course, and was designed to look vaguely like a gladatorial helmet; two wide holes for her eyes and reinforced strip that would cover her nose. Two flaps hung down from the sides to cover her ears and long enough to reach past her shoulders. The back of the mask was short to allow her hair to flow freely. As Sumire reached for the mask her eyes went to a small calendar that was affixed to the corner of the mirror. Every day she would cross off a day on the calendar. Her eyes widened when she realized that, as of the coming Monday, her agreement with Kodachi Kuno would end and so would her time as Sumire.</p><p>"No." Sumire whispered in shock.</p><p>How long Sumire stared at the calendar she didn't know and she only realized she was staring at the calendar when a knock on the dressing room door snapped her out of it. "Y-yes?"</p><p>"Sumire, honey?" Michiko Osakawa's voice came through the closed door. "Are you okay?"</p><p>"I-I'm..." Sumire began. Suddenly she began to sob uncontrollably. "I-I can't." She sobbed. "I-I can't."</p><p>"Sumire?" Michiko's concern filled voice came through the closed door. "What's wrong?" There was no answer. "Honey?" Michiko said. "You're scaring me baby." Michiko said after again not hearing a response. "Baby?" Michiko said. "If you don't answer me, I'm coming in." Michiko counted to ten and when the door didn't open she opened it herself and walked in. She found Sumire at her vanity with her head buried in her arms. The faint sound of sobbing came to her ears. Michiko walked over to Sumire and knelt down next to her. "Baby?"</p><p>"T-two more days." Sumire said in a pain filled muffled voice. "T-two more days b-before you h-hate me."</p><p>"Oh Baby." Michiko replied soothingly. "You know I'll never hate you." She said. "I love you."</p><p>"Y-y-you love Sumire." Sumire replied. She began to sob louder.</p><p>"But Baby." Michiko placed an arm across Sumire's shoulders. "You are Sumire." She said. "No matter who you are, you'll always be Sumire."</p><p>"I-I'm s-s-so scared, Mitch." Sumire replied without lifting her head from her arms. "T-this passed month." She sniffed. "I've never...never been s-so happy. I-I never f-felt..." Suddenly Sumire raised her head and buried her face against Michiko's shoulder. "I can't..can't l-lose you, I-Id rather...rather ...d-d-die."</p><p>"Shh. Shh." Michiko said gently. "What's all this talk of dying?' She said. "You won't lose me." She said. Sumire lifted her head to reveal her tear streaked and unmasked face. Michiko's mouth opened in a wide O of surprise. "You know, Dachi is going to very mad at you for revealing yourself before the contract is up." Michiko said finally. She smiled."Your makeup is terribly smeared."</p><p>"Y-you don't hate me?" Sumire replied. "Now that you know?"</p><p>"Well, I guess I should be a little bit angry." Michiko grabbed a tissue from the vanity and started drying Sumire's eyes. She shook her head in amusement. "Who would have thought that cable's coldest bitch had a heart."</p><p>"I am cold." Sumire declared sadly. "A cold fish, that's what everyone calls me."</p><p>"That's because they don't know you, like I do." Michiko replied. She chuckled. "You know, your reputation as a bitch is going to be totally ruined, Ms. Kato."</p><p>"Sumire." Sumire pleaded. "Please Mitch, Sumire."</p><p>"Always, Baby." Michiko replied. "I told you; no matter who you really are, you're always Sumire to me." She said. Sumire hugged her hard. "My poor baby." Michiko said in soothing tones. "Now, why don't I let you put your face back together..." She began.</p><p>"Don't leave me." Sumire said almost frantically.</p><p>Michiko leaned forward and kissed Sumire on the lips. "I'm not going anywhere." She said.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The elevator opened and two women walked out. An attractive and fit woman in her early forties and a younger women dressed all in violet. The women in violet held the older woman's hand tightly and walked very close as if afraid the older woman would disappear. To those who knew Sumire, and that included all the women who worked at the club, the woman in violet seemed a nervous shadow of her usual self. So much so that several of them stopped what they were doing and began to follow the couple.</p><p>"Sumire looks scared out of her mind." Miki said to Fumie in concern. "Do you think they had a fight?" She said. "Oh hell, they're heading straight for Ms. Kuno's office." She grabbed Fumie's hand. "Come on." She said. The two women followed Michiko and Sumire all the way to Kodachi Kuno's off. They approached just as Sumire knocked hesitantly on the door.</p><p>"It's Sumire, Ms. Kuno." Sumire announced herself in a hesitant voice. "I need to speak to you." She said through the door. The door opened and Noriko Mata stood in the doorway. "Excuse me, Ms. Mata, but I...I need to speak to Ms. Kuno."</p><p>Noriko looked at Sumire then looked at Michiko. Michiko was looking at Sumire with an expression of deep concern. "We were just about to leave." Noriko said. "But..." She stepped back and waved the two women into the office. Miki and Fumie walked in with them. Miki shut the door behind them.</p><p>Kodachi was sitting behind her desk and Kiko was sitting on the edge of the desk, both were looking at Sumire. Still holding Michiko's hand, Sumire approached "Excuse me, Ms. Kuno, I apologize for disturbing you." She said looking down. "I just came to say...goodbye." She said.</p><p>"Goodbye?" Kodachi said in surprise. "Are you leaving?"</p><p>Without looking up, Sumire nodded. "Yes, Ms. Kuno." She said.</p><p>"Dare I ask, why?" Kodachi replied.</p><p>"I-I've broken my promise." Sumire's shoulders' shook in despair. "I-I...oh, Ms. Kuno, it's over." She sobbed. "It's all over." She said in a rush. "Tonight...tonight I realized...and then Mitch...and I couldn't stand it anymore, Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Sumire, slow down." Kodachi said in alarm. "You're not making any sense." She looked at the older woman. "Mitch, whatever is the matter with Sumire?"</p><p>"She knows." Wailed Sumire. "I was so afraid...so afraid...she knows Ms. Kuno." She stopped. "But...but I'm glad Mitch knows, I couldn't pretend anymore, Ms. Kuno, I couldn't...I just couldn't." Sumire took a breath. She swallowed and visibly got control of herself. "So, you see, Ms Kuno." She said. "I broke my promise." Sumire swallowed again. "I will...will..."</p><p>"And when did this revelation occur?" Kodachi interrupted.</p><p>"About five minutes ago." Michiko Osakawa said. "It's okay, baby." She said to Sumire. "You can stay with me tonight."</p><p>"Five minutes ago." Mused Kodachi. Kodachi leaned back in her chair. "Noriko." She said. "How many days has...Sumire been here?" She asked.</p><p>"Counting tonight?" Noriko replied. She tilted her head. "Why, I believe that makes exactly twenty eight days."</p><p>"Does it?" Kodachi said in amused surprise. Kodachi sat up. "I will expect you to finish out the evening, Sumire." Kodachi said in no nonsense tones. "I am very disappionted, Sumire, very disappointed." Kodachi raised a hand as Kiko was about to speak. Kodachi gave the young girl a wink. "I was hoping that you'd at least be willing to continue your employment on a...part time capacity."</p><p>"Part time?" Sumire said in surprise.</p><p>"Four weeks, Sumire." Kodachi said. "Your contract was for four weeks." She sighed. "If we did something that would make you want to leave, I apologize." Kodachi said contritely. "I did think you were a wonderful addition to our...family." She sighed again and pulled open a drawer in her desk. "I had already had your...graduation present...made." She reached into the drawer and pulled out a small wrapped package.</p><p>"But... but..." Stammered Sumire.</p><p>"Not even two days a week?" Kodachi asked in sad tones. She extended the package. "Two days a week?" She teased. "I thought for sure you'd tell her the first week." She said.</p><p>"I think Suki won the pool." Miki said in a loud aside. "She had eighteen days."</p><p>Sumire hesitantly took the package. "I would like that very much, Ms. Kuno."</p><p>Kodachi smiled and nodded. "Mitch I do hope you'll continue your...patronage of our little establishment." She said. "Unfortunately my contract with Sumire ends tonight so you'll have to make your own arrangements directly with Sumire. We will however have to charge you our standard fee if you have need of a room...for the evening."</p><p>Michiko Osakawa chuckled. "You are an evil woman, Dachi." She placed an arm around Sumire's waist. "I expect Sumire to have her suite for the rest of the weekend." She said to Kodachi. Kodachi smiled and nodded. "Excellent." Michiko turned to Sumire. "See Baby, I told you everything would be fine." She said. Michiko gave Kodachi a negligent wave and led Sumire out of the office.</p><p>"Well, I'm glad that's sorted out." Kodachi said once the door closed. She stood. "Now I think we should...join the party."</p><p>Kiko hopped off the desk and took Kodachi's hand. "Good." She said. "I'm sure everyone is wondering where we are." She giggled. "Except maybe Mom." She said. Kodachi joined Kiko in laughing. "Oh I can't wait to see Pema and Kagomi." She said excitedly. "And I can't wait to meet their new boyfriends," She said. "I know they're going to be cute." She said confidently. "Auntie Dachi?"</p><p>"Yes, Baby?" Kodachi replied.</p><p>"When I'm eighteen, can I work in the club too?" Kiko asked. The women in the room all seemed to hold their respective breaths.</p><p>Kodachi choked off the immediately denial. 'You knew she was going to ask one day.' She thought. 'She sees the fun, the excitement. She sees the clothes and hears the laughter.' Kodachi sighed. 'It's your own fault.' Scolded herself silently. "Ask again when you're eighteen, okay Baby?" The rest of the women in room all breathed out in relief.</p><p>Kiko smiled. "Okay Auntie." Kiko replied.</p><p>Miki looked at her watch. "We better get going." She said. "Or there'll be a riot."</p><p>Nodoka looked up as three women, well two women and a young girl, approached the table. "There you are." Nodoka said in mild annoyance.</p><p>"Sorry, Auntie." Kodachi replied. "Several last minute...details to attend to." She said. "Good evening, brother." She greeted Tatewaki. "Lady Kuno, Lady Kimi." She said in greeting. The two women nodded their heads in reply. "Thank you so much for attending."</p><p>"Wouldn't miss it for the world." Kimi Ota replied. "Good thing you showed up." She said. "Auntie was running out of small talk and..." She waved a hand toward Koko and Hiro who were looking into each other's eyes and were seemingly oblivious to anything around them. "As you can see, Koko and her boyfriend have been, shall we say, less then communicative."</p><p>Kodachi hid a smile behind her hand. "So I see." She said. Kodachi looked at Kiko. "Should we...disturb them?" She asked.</p><p>Kiko shook her head firmly. "No way." She declared.</p><p>"I agree." Kodachi replied. "Well Auntie, as they say, it's show time."</p><p>"Wonderful." Nodoka said pleasantly. She stood up from the table and bowed to everyone. "If you will excuse me?' She said. She waited untill Tatewaki nodded before turning away and made her stately way to the stage and the clubs sound system. Nodoka glanced at the stage and saw Aoi waiting at a curtain. Nodoka nodded. Aoi grinned and went behind the curtain.</p><p>Nodoka walked over to the stage and picked up a microphone. "Good evening." Her unamplified voice was barely heard over the murmur of the crowd. "Oh bother." She checked the console, sighed and pressed a button. She raised the microphone again. "Good evening." This time her amplified voice cut through the chatter. Slowly the room quieted.</p><p>Nodoka waited until she was sure she had the crowds full attention. "Good evening." She said again. "My friends." She turned to the black man at the piano. She nodded. Ron Jackon turned and began to play. "You must remember this." She sang. "A kiss is but a kiss." The crowd picked up the song until it seemed the entire audience joined in on the refrain. "As time goes by." Nodoka stopped singing and blew a kiss to the audience. "My friends, tonight is a special night. A night many of you have waited impatiently for." She said. "Some of you may even have been here when they first appeared." She smiled as several restrained but carrying calls of agreement came in response. "My friends, may I present; Daddy's Girls, the Crown Jewels of Ky's Cafe, our own Jewel and Gem."</p><p>Unlike the stately, almost ritualized manner that occurred when Sumire was presented, Pema and Kagomi bounced out from behind the curtain and started waving to the crowd. Seemingly as one, the entire audience shot to their feet and applauded the two girls. Pema and Kagomi smiled widely. The piano started playing a spritely swing number from the era and Pema and Kagomi started dancing to the music. The two teen girls waved to different people, blowing the occasional kiss to someone. They strutted back and forth like models on a catwalk. Cries of 'Gem' and 'Jewel' filled the air as patrons tried to get the two girls attention. Pema and Kagomi smiled wider. Pema whispered in Kagomi's ear suddenly. Kagomi giggled and nodded.</p><p>Pema walked over to the edge of the stage and beckoned to Nodoka. Nodoka walked over. Nodoka smiled at something Pema said and handed her the microphone. Pema took the microphone and walked back over to Kagomi. "Hi everyone." Pema and Kagomi chorused cheerfully. "Jewel and Gem just want to say." Pema said. "That we oh, so happy, we here." She said. "We hope to make...that right Gem...to make?" Pema asked. Kagomi nodded. "We hope to make many new friends."</p><p>"And maybe a couple good friends." Kagomi added.</p><p>"Oh yes...good friends." Pema said with a smile. "Maybe."</p><p>Ranma leaned back in his booth and started chuckling. "That's my girl." He said in cheeful but quiet tones. "Sell it."</p><p>"It's already sold, remember?" Akane pointed out.</p><p>"For now." Ranma replied. "Tomasayo and Yamada are going to have to work real hard to keep them."</p><p>"Those boys don't have enough money to keep them for long." Ukyo added.</p><p>"Wasn't talking about the boys." Ranma replied. "I have no doubt that Nabs has already spoken to the boys' fathers." He said. "And...have you noticed that the privacy curtain is around Mom's booth but Mom is at the stage?" He said. "Yet Mom's boys aren't with her."</p><p>"And the two new Geisha are nowhere to be seen." Ukyo said musingly. "You know they didn't really act like Geisha." She said. "They acted more like...like..."</p><p>"Two rich ,proper and extremely bored, housewives." Akane suggested. She giggled. "She wouldn't..." Began Akane. "Yes she would." Akane corrected herself. "I wonder if there will be a video." She looked around. "I don't see Gos."</p><p>"They'll be a video." Ukyo said assuredly. "Insurance."</p><p>"Ewww." Ranma said in disgust. Akane and Ukyo laughed.</p><p>Pema and Kagomi returned the microphone to Nodoka and with a last wave left the two girls strutted off the stage and back through the curtain. The crowd erupted into applause. Pema and Kagomi stuck their heads out, waved one more time and then ducked back through the curtain. Waitresses and hostesses began circulating through the crowd while Nodoka walked back to her curtained booth.</p><p>"Ladies?" Nodoka said annoncing her presence. Nodoka heard a frantic rustling from behind the curtain. She counted to ten before parting the curtain and entering the dim alcove. The two women where straightening their kimonos as Nodoka entered. "Have my boys been good company?" She asked as she entered. Chisako and Nagisa nodded quickly. "Excellent." Nodoka rubbed her hands together. "Are you still interested in meeting Gem and Jewel?" She asked.</p><p>"Well." Nagisa said breathlessly. "Maybe...maybe another time." She panted. "I feel...I feel a little faint."</p><p>"Oh that's terrible." Nodoka replied. "That will not do." She said. "Boys." Nodoka said. "Why don't you take our guests to the second floor?" She suggested. "I think a short rest will do you both good." She said. "No, what you both need is a massage." She corrected decisively. "My boys have such excellent hands." She nodded to Daisuke and Jiro. "As I know so well." She said. "Why they'll have you...purring like kittens in no time." She smiled. "Nothing is too good for my good friends." Nodoka said earnestly. "I'd be terribly hurt if you didn't."</p><p>"Well...if you're sure it isn't an inconvenience." Nagisa said in longing tones.</p><p>"Not at all." Nodoka said. "I insist." Moments later Nodoka was alone in her booth. She raised her hand to her mouth as she giggled. "What good boys." She said. Nodoka opened the curtain before sitting down. She sniffed. Nodoka took a small bottle from her bodice and sprayed the air. "That's better." She said a moment later. She beckoned with a hand and Fumie ran over.</p><p>"It's a madhouse out there, Auntie." Fumie said with laughter in her voice. "Everyone's bidding." She said. "Even clients wth dates." She said. "And the dates are putting them up to it." She shook her head. "We're running out of envelopes."</p><p>Nodoka chuckled. "Excellent." She said. "Have Miki bring the girls over in about...oh...ten minutes." Nodoka took an envelope from her bodice and placed it on the table. She then extended her hand and Fumie gave her an additional stack of envelopes. "We must make this look...proper." She said.</p><p>"Of course, Auntie." Fumie said in agreement. "Do you really think you can get them to pick Tomosayo and Yamada?" She asked.</p><p>"Oh, I think so." Nodoka replied. "Make it fifteen minutes, Fumie."</p><p>"Yes, Auntie." Fumire replied. She walked away.</p><p>Nodoka sorted through the envelopes that Fumie had brought along with a number more that Suki and Aoi brought over soon after. By the time Fumie returned with Miki, Pema and Kagomi, she had three piles in front of her. Nodoka looked up as an excited Pema and Kagomi slid in next to her. "The curtain Miki." Nodoka said. Miki closed the curtain and then sat next to Fumie. "Well ladies." Nodoka said in pleased tones. "Your debut has met with...understandable enthusiasm."</p><p>Pema and Kagomi looked at each other and smiled. They both looked at Nodoka. "So, bids good?" Pema chirped.</p><p>Nodoka gave Pema a slightly annoyed look that was quickly replaced with one of understanding and respect. "The bids were, for the most part...appropriate to the circumstances." Nodoka replied.</p><p>"That either means they were what Auntie thought they'd be or...more." MIki commented. "Come on Auntie, don't leave us in suspense." She said. "I have money riding on this."</p><p>"Yes." replied Nodoka with a smile. "I know." She said. "Oh very well." She said. Nodoka waved to the stacks. Each stack held three or four envelopes." Nodoka tapped one stack. "These were the highest bids." Nodoka said. "In fact so high that Fumie made sure they were checked and verified before accepting them." She nodded to the pretty brunette. "Each of the men represented by these envelopes are beyond rich. You will want for nothing."</p><p>"What's the catch?" Kagomi asked. "Gramps always said when something sounded too good to be true, it usually had a catch."</p><p>"Your grandfather is most perceptive and you honor him by remembering his words." Nodoka said in approval. "The catch, Gem..." Nodoka replied. "Is that the youngest of these men is in his sixties." Both teenaged girls grimaced. Nodoka tapped the second stack. "Now these bids were significantly smaller but, in my opinion, still very generous."</p><p>"Generous?" Miki said. "Whoa." She said. "Auntie doesn't use that word often."</p><p>"Two of the men are married." Nodoka continued. "And the third is a woman in her fifties."</p><p>"She pretty?" Pema asked with a touch of interest.</p><p>"Handsome rather than pretty." Nodoka replied. "All three would treat one of you well."</p><p>"One of us?" Kagomi said musingly. "That's sort of not what we were looking for." She said. "I think Jewel and me, well, you know."</p><p>Nodoka smiled. "Which brings me to the last bids." She said. "Individually they are...adequate." She said. "But there are two bids in each envelope."</p><p>Kagomi and Pema leaned back and smiled. "Now it sound interesting." Pema said. "Any Gem and Jewel age?"</p><p>"Actually all of the young men are in their early twenties." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Very interesting." Kagomi said. "Go on."</p><p>"The two young men in each envelope are either cousins or brothers." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Brothers?" Kagomi asked. "Twins?" She asked. Nodoka nodded. "That could be fun." She said to Pema.</p><p>"Maybe...for little while." Pema replied doubtfully. "What about other two?" She asked.</p><p>"First and second cousins respectively." Nodoka continued. "Early twenties, tall, handsome, they aren't rich themselves but their parents are." She said. "All college educated." She informed the two teens. "Very much alike." She said. "As were their bids."</p><p>"I guess we could flip a coin." Kagomi said. "Handsome, huh?"</p><p>"Very." Replied Nodoka. "just ask the girls." She nodded toward Fumie and Miki. "It's En'ichi and Kenichi Sagahara and Chouji Tamasayo and Naoki Yamada." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Cute." Chorused Miki and Fumie.</p><p>"En'ichi is a little shy though." Miki continued."Other than that..." Miki shrugged. "Well there is one...difference." Miki added after a moments thought. "I did go on a date with two of them." She said.</p><p>"Miki, I don't think that's something the girls are interested in hearing." Nodoka said sharply while inwardly praising the woman. 'I am so glad I spoke to Miki first.' She thought.</p><p>"Yes we are." Kagomi disagreed. "DId you say you dated both or went on a date with both of them?"</p><p>"The second." Miki replied. She grinned. "It was fun."</p><p>Pema and Kagomi looked at each other. They turned back to Miki. "They no mind..." Pema asked. "Being together?"</p><p>"I think they prefer it." Miki replied.</p><p>Pema and Kagomi looked at each other again and smiled. They turned to Nodoka. "Which one their envelope?" Asked Pema. Nodoka shuffled through the envelopes and then handed one to Pema. Pema took it and opened it. There were two cards. Kagomi leaned her head next to Pema's and the two girls looked at the card. They raised their eyebrows simultaneously. "I think we want meet Chouji Tamasayo and Naoki Yamada." Pema said. Kagomi nodded in agreement.</p><p>End Chapter 5</p><p>Author's Notes: Glad everyone's enjoying the latest QR story but more importantly, I'm very happy everyone liked Mirror Mirror. Later all.</p>
