</div><p>Chapter 8</p><p>'Repercussions'</p><p>The next morning a very subdued Ranma and Akane followed Nabiki and Kimi into the cafeteria. Nabiki kept looking back worriedly. 'I think I better have talk with Akane.' She turned to Kimi. "Hey Kimi would you mind going to see Koemi after breakfast?" She said. "Tell her we got her shipment." Nabiki noticed that both Akane and Ranma flinched at her words. "Take Ranko with you. Just in case."</p><p>Kimi had also noticed the forlorn expressions on Ranma and Akane's faces. She nodded. "Sure Nabs." Kimi watched as the two younger women picked at their meal. 'Something happened.' She thought. 'And I think I know what.'. Kimi hurried through her breakfast. "Come on Ranko." She said. Without a word Ranma got up and followed Kimi.</p><p>Nabiki looked at Akane. "Come with me Sis." She said. "I think we need to talk."</p><p>Akane nodded without looking up. In a short time they were in Nabiki's cell. Nabiki in her chair and Akane on the lower bunk. "Okay sis." Nabiki said in a firm voice. "Spill it."</p><p>Akane remained silent for a long time. Then, "I screwed up Nabiki." She whispered. "I think I really screwed it up big time."</p><p>"What happened?" Nabiki moved to the bunk and put an arm around her younger sister. "Talk to me sis."</p><p>Akane shook her head. "It's too awful." Akane began. "He's going to leave me, I just know it." She wailed. Nabiki said nothing, she just waited. "Last night." Akane looked at her hands. "Last night, we went to see Ukyo." Akane began to shake. "It's all her fault." She growled angrily. "If she hadn't, if Ranma, oh gods, I raped him Nabiki. I raped Ranma." She screamed in panic. Akane buried her face in her hands.</p><p>"Bullshit." Snapped Nabiki. "You could rape Ranma about as much as I could." She said. "Talk to me." She ordered.</p><p>Tears came to Akane's eyes. "Ukyo kept pushing and pushing, telling me I had to treat Ranma right, that I had to treat him like a girl. And Ranma, Ranma. And then I.. Oh sis it's too horrible." Akane slammed the cot with her fist making it creak. "It wasn't supposed to be like that, it wasn't supposed to be like that." She looked at Nabiki with tear filled eyes. "What am I going to do? What am I going to do?" Hysteria filled Akane's voice.</p><p>"The first thing you're going to do is get a hold of yourself." Nabiki snapped. "And the second thing you're going to do is apologize to Ranma." Nabiki sighed. "Look so you were a little rough. Okay a lot rough." She amended at Akane's glare. "He'll get over it." She raised a finger. "If you make amends right away."</p><p>"How?" Akane cried. "He won't even look at me." Akane punched the bunk again. "I really messed it up this time."</p><p>"Stop that." Nabiki pinched the bridge of her nose. 'I'm going to have to have a little talk with Ukyo.' She decided. "Now here is what you are going to do."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma and Kimi slowly walked back to their cells. Kimi paused as Ranma hesitated at her cell door. "Now remember what I told you." Kimi said. "Be strong." Ranma nodded and slid the cell door open.<p>"I'm back." She said glumly. A whimper made her look up.</p><p>Akane was kneeling in the middle of the cell. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." She said in a broken voice. "I got mad at Ukyo and took it out on you." Akane bowed repeatedly as she spoke. "Please don't hate me." Akane wiped her eyes. "I couldn't stand it if you hated me." She bowed again. "I'm sorry." She looked up at Ranma with an anguished look. "Yell at me. Hit me if you want. Just don't hate me."</p><p>"Akane."</p><p>"Tell me what I have to do to make it up to you." Akane cried. "Anything, I'll do anything." She shuffled over to Ranma on her knees and wrapped her arms around the redhead's legs. "Anything, just don't hate me." She said. "I'll." She swallowed. "I'll stay here the next time you see Ukyo."</p><p>"I don't know if I want to see Ukyo right now." Ranma grumbled.</p><p>"Yes you do." Akane said miserably. "Because she was right. Because she wouldn't have, wouldn't have." Akane broke off. "Ranma!" She wailed.</p><p>"I wanted you to stop." Ranma said in a cold voice. "And you wouldn't"</p><p>"I know." Whispered Akane. "I hurt you. I know I hurt you." Akane held tightly to Ranma's legs. "It wasn't supposed to be like that. I let my jealousy get the better of me." She hung her head. "I have no excuse." She amended.</p><p>"Damn right." Ranma snapped. "You gonna listen next time when I tell you to stop?"</p><p>"Next time?" Akane gasped in sudden hope. "Oh Ranma." Akane looked up from the floor. "You don't hate me?"</p><p>"I'm kinda mad at you right now." Ranma replied.</p><p>Akane nodded. "That's okay." She whimpered. "You have every right to be." She let go of Ranma's legs and stood up. Akane hesitantly took Ranma's hand. To her relief she didn't pull away. "Look I got you some ice cream." She babbled. "And I traded some chocolate for a manga I know you like." She pulled Ranma to the table and made the redhead sit down. Akane stood behind Ranma and started rubbing her shoulders. "Is there anything else I can get for you? Or do for you?"</p><p>"Akane?"</p><p>"Yes Ranma."</p><p>"Shut up."</p><p>"Yes Ranma." Akane smiled slightly and continued to massage Ranma's shoulders. 'He doesn't hate me. He doesn't hate me.' Rang in her head. Akane stopped massaging Ranma's shoulders, ran to her bunk and then ran back. She slowly undid Ranma's braid and then began brushing Ranma's shiny red hair.</p><p>"It still hurts a little." Ranma said quietly a little while later. "Next time can we take it a little slower?"</p><p>"Oh Ranma." Akane sobbed in relief. "We'll do it any way you want. I'll do whatever you want."</p><p>"Yeah?" Ranma's voice seemed warmer. "So if I told you to stand on you hands in the corner?" Akane ran to the corner and stood on her hands. Ranma laughed. "I could get used to this." She said. "Come over here Tomboy." Akane got to her feet and hurried over to Ranma.</p><p>"Yes Ranma?"</p><p>"I need a cuddle." Ranma said with a slight smile.</p><p>Akane scooped Ranma up in her arms eagerly. Ranma put her hand on Akane's chest. "Just a cuddle." She said. "I don't think I'm ready for anything else, okay?"</p><p>Akane swallowed the lump that suddenly formed in her throat. "Whatever you want Ranma." Akane carried Ranma over to the bunk and gently placed Ranma on the lower bunk and slowly climbed in after her. Akane wrapped Ranma in her arms. "I'm so sorry Ranma." She said. "Does it really still hurt?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Yeah."</p><p>Akane stared at the back of Ranma's head consumed with self hatred. 'I don't know why you're even speaking to me.' Akane thought morbidly. 'I wouldn't if it had been me.' Akane's eye's burned with unshed tears as if even her body was punishing her. 'Damn you Ukyo. Why did you have to push?' Akane thought in anger. The anger changed it's target. 'Damn you Akane Tendo, why can't you ever learn to control your stupid temper?'. The tears finally began to flow. 'Damn you Akane Tendo. Damn you.'</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Are they always like that?" Kimi asked Nabiki.<p>"What? Violent and selfish?" Nabiki nodded. "Yep." Nabiki looked at Kimi in consideration. "I'm going to tell you something." Nabiki said. "It's going to sound impossible but it isn't."</p><p>"I'm listening." Kimi replied. She folded her arms across her chest and waited.</p><p>"Contrary to all appearances, Ranko is a boy." Nabiki said. She raised her hand to stop Kimi from protesting. "A little over two years ago, Ranko," Nabiki paused. "Actually his name is really Ranma. Anyway a little over two years ago, Ranma and his idiot father were traveling in China. There they came across this ancient training ground called Jusenkyo. In Jusenkyo are all these pools of water. If you fall into a pool, you take on the form of whatever drowned in it last. Ranma landed in a spring where a young girl drowned."</p><p>"Do you really expect me to believe this?" Kimi replied.</p><p>"Want me to prove it?" Nabiki replied calmly.</p><p>"Well, yeah." Kimi shook her head. "Come on Nabs. Magic water?"</p><p>"Magic water." Nabiki rubbed the bridge of her nose. "Cold water, she's a girl. Hot water, a boy." Nabiki shrugged. "To make matters worse, my idiot father and his idiot father made an agreement that Ranma would marry one of us Tendo girls." Suddenly Nabiki laughed. "Damn if I had known how much fun a girl could be I wouldn't have palmed him off on Akane."</p><p>"So Akane was always a lesbian." Kimi surmised.</p><p>Nabiki held out a hand and waggled it. "I always thought so but she, well let's just say that Akane didn't take it too well."</p><p>"Ah." Kimi unfolded her arms. "That explains a lot." She leaned forward. "She really turns into a boy?"</p><p>"Other way around. He turns into a girl." Nabiki corrected. "And that's the point. Ranma was raised to be as macho as possible."</p><p>"I'm starting to get the picture." Kimi shook her head. "I still want proof. But if what you're telling me is true, turning into a girl would have been the absolute worst thing that could have happened to him."</p><p>"No kidding." Nabiki smirked. "They almost destroyed the house before they finally admitted they cared about each other. And it took coming here before they'd learned to deal with the sex part. Hell they're still learning to deal with the sex part."</p><p>"Your sister's an idiot." Kimi said. "They're both idiots."</p><p>"No kidding." Nabiki replied. "Guess what, It gets worse."</p><p>"Somehow I had a feeling you'd say that." Kimi rolled her eyes. "Let me guess, this Ukyo character Ranko, Ranma told me about." Kimi's brow furrowed. "Is Ukyo a boy or a girl? Ranko really didn't say."</p><p>"Girl. Sorta." Nabiki sighed. "From age six, Ukyo was raised as a boy. But not before she was also engaged to Ranma." Nabiki's eyes widened slightly in amusement. "She dresses like a boy more often than not. And she's really good at it."</p><p>"Let me see if I got this straight." Kimi raised her hand. She tapped a finger. "Ranko was a macho jerk who now turns into a girl." She tapped another finger. "He is engaged to your sister, a repressed lesbian." She tapped another finger. "And is also engaged to another girl, Ukyo, who is probably also a lesbian or at least gender confused."</p><p>"Add to the mix a girl named Shampoo who is a member of a tribe of Amazons." Nabiki replied. "Not a lesbian, but even more macho than Ranma."She nodded. "But yeah, that's about the size of it."</p><p>"That's too stupid not to be true." Kimi shook her head. "About this Ukyo broad." Kimi said. "From what I got out of Ranma, she, he still has feelings for her." Kimi leaned back. "So what are you going to do about her?"</p><p>"Ukyo?" Nabiki asked. Kimi nodded. "Give her a piece of my mind next time I see her. Other than that, I have no idea." Nabiki gave Kimi a wry smile. "On the other hand, if it wasn't for Ukyo, my sister and Ranma would still be dancing around some things."</p><p>"Do you think Ukyo planned this?" Kimi asked seriously. "Do you think she purposely goaded Akane into it?"</p><p>Nabiki opened her mouth and then closed it with a click. "You know, with Ukyo that's a distinct possibility." Nabiki said. "Damn, Akane did say she was pushing. She didn't say how but I think I can make a couple good guesses."</p><p>"Your sister can't back down from a dare can she?" Kimi frowned slightly. "I still don't understand something. You told me Ranko is better than Akane, so how was she able to, to." Kimi refused to say the word.</p><p>"Rape her?" Supplied Nabiki. "I don't know. It shouldn't have been possible." She sighed. "Best guess is that deep down Ranma wanted this." She shook her head. "No. Not what happened." She shook her head again. "They've always had an almost abusive relationship." Nabiki snorted quietly. "Not almost. It was abusive. Unfortunately it was in both directions." Kimi shuddered slightly. "Ranma really was no better than my sister in some things."</p><p>Nabiki looked at the walls of the cell. "I think we better suspend operations for a while." She said finally. "Until this blows over."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The days that followed were torture for Akane. Nabiki and Kimi refused to talk to her for anything other than the minimum necessary. Sometimes Kimi would take Ranma off for a while to talk to her. Ranma never discussed what they talked about. Worse were the looks that Akane received from many of the other inmates. Apparently what had happened had become the topic of discussion throughout the prison. To her shame some of the looks were of approval and even respect.<p>'How can they respect someone like me?' She asked herself over and over. Akane shuddered. Akane would spend most of her time in the weight room. Placing heavier and heavier plates on the machines and work herself until her muscles shrieked. Then she'd run until she was exhausted. Akane would barely pick at her meals and when she showered she'd just let cold water run over her until her teeth chattered.</p><p>The only bright side was that Ranma still talked to her and even was willing to cuddle at night. Akane was too afraid to attempt anything else and Ranma didn't offer. Every night she'd gingerly wrap Ranma in her arms and wait for the redhead to fall asleep. Then she'd cry herself to sleep. 'I can't stand this anymore.' Akane thought morbidly one night as she waited for sleep to overtake her. "You'll be better off without me." Akane whispered to Ranma's sleeping form. 'It won't be difficult to steal a knife.' She told herself as she fell asleep. 'Tomorrow then.' She kissed Ranma on the back of the head. "Good bye Ranma." She whispered.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ukyo cleaned the grill at the all night restaurant. Jimmu was more than happy to get a break, especially during the graveyard shift. Ukyo brushed back a lock of her hair and sighed. "Well he hasn't come by in a week now, so I guess Akane finally did what she had to." She said to the grill. She wiped at her eyes. "I guess deep down I hoped she wouldn't." The bell over the door tinkled and Ukyo turned around. Three very tough looking men in dark suits entered. Ukyo narrowed her eyes. "Have a seat gentlemen." Ukyo said in a pleasant voice.<p>"We won't be staying long." One man said. He grinned nastily and reached into the front of his suit. Ukyo caught a flash of metal. Without thinking she vaulted over the counter, pulled her battle spatula from it's place on her back and charged.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma woke to someone pounding on the cell door. "Huh?" She mumbled. Ranma extricated herself from Akane's sleepy embrace and walked to the door. "Yeah?"<p>"Ranma, let me in." Came Ukyo's pain filled voice.</p><p>Ranma's eyes snapped open. "Ukyo? What are you doing here?" She slid the door open wide and Ukyo fell into the cell. "Ukyo!"</p><p>"Ranma?" Akane called from the bunk. "What?" She saw the form of Ukyo sprawled on the floor. "Ukyo?"</p><p>Ranma knelt down and turned the chef over. A large splash of wetness covered her right side. In the darkness it was black but the smell of blood came to Ranma's nose. "Akane, light!" She snapped. A glow sprung up in the room. "Oh shit." Ranma exclaimed in horror and anger. "She's hurt."</p><p>"You should see the other guys." Ukyo's weak voice returned. "It's not," Ukyo shuddered. "It hurts Ran-chan."</p><p>"Lie still, Uk-chan." Ranma said in a comforting tone. She ripped the front of Ukyo's clothing open. "Oh shit." She repeated. Blood was trickling from an obvious bullet wound in her shoulder. Ranma grabbed the bed sheet and ripped it into strips and quickly fashioned a pad that she bound to Ukyo's shoulder. "Who did this?" Ranma growled. "Never mind, let's get you to the infirmary." Ranma picked Ukyo up.</p><p>"How are we going to explain how she got here?" Akane asked. She flinched at Ranma's look. "Right. Who gives a crap." She said. "Let's go." Akane led the way letting the light coming from her hands guide them through the darkness. They hadn't gone too far when there was the sound of running booted feet.</p><p>"Halt." A guard ordered. She held a shock baton in one hand. "Don't take a step further."</p><p>"Screw you." Ranma growled and kept walking. "I gotta get Ukyo to the infirmary." She glared at the guard. "Be a good girl and get out of my way. Now!"</p><p>The guard swung the shock stick at Ranma. Still holding Ukyo, Ranma's bare foot shot up and connected with it. There was a flash and the guard found herself flung to the ground by the blast. Ranma kept walking. Akane glared at the remaining guard. "Don't even think it." She ordered. "Now we are heading to the infirmary, come along but don't get in the way."</p><p>"Who are you to order me around like that?" The guard snapped back.</p><p>Akane grinned nastily and raised her hands. The guard hadn't noticed the glow coming from Akane but now she did as the glow got brighter. What appeared to be fire surrounded Akane's hands. "Got any more stupid questions?' Akane growled. Akane turned and hurried after Ranma.</p><p>The guard reached to her belt. "We got three prisoners out of their cells." She said hurriedly. "We need backup." Suddenly the air was split by the sound of alarms. The guard sighed in relief and chased after Akane.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"In the news today, there is an apparent hostage situation at the Tokyo Women's Correctional Facility." Began the newscaster.<p>"That's where my babies are." Soun said in shock. Soun's shock deepened when pictures of Ranma and Akane were flashed on the screen. "What?" He stood. "Kasumi." He yelled.</p><p>Kasumi came running into the main room. "Father?" She looked at where Soun was pointing. "Oh my."</p><p>"Call Ono." Soun ordered. "He has a car."</p><p>"Yes Father." Kasumi raced over to the phone and dialed. "Ono." She said. "Get over here right now. Bring the car." She hung up and dialed again. "Auntie." She said when the telephone was answered. "Something's happening at the prison. Ono is coming with the car." She nodded. "Yes, that makes sense, we'll pick you up." She hung up.</p><p>"Details are sketchy but the prison authorities report that Ranko Tendo and Akane Tendo, two members of the so called Tendo Gang have taken control of the prison infirmary. Along with the prison medic, a second, unknown person, is being held hostage in the infirmary." The newscaster reported. "We now go live to the prison." The newscaster's face was replaced by a pan of the prison.</p><p>"We have an update to the hostage situation." Came the voice of a reporter. "The second hostage has been identified as one Ukyo Kuonji a popular chef from the Nerima district." A blurry picture of Ukyo at her most masculine appeared on the screen.</p><p>"Ukyo?" Kasumi gasped. "What is she doing there?"</p><p>The scene changed again. This time a reporter was holding a microphone in front of a very thin, older man. The words 'Warden Itsuro Kenichi' flashed under the screen. "Warden Kenichi. What's going on? How did Mr. Kuonji get in the prison? How did he get shot? Was he shot by a member of the Tendo Gang?"</p><p>The warden shook his head. "I can't comment at this time." He said. "Except to say we are in negotiations to resolve this issue." The warden stalked off. He was followed by a very powerfully built woman in her thirties.</p><p>"Yasuhara." Exclaimed Soun.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Okay Tendo." Growled Warden Kenichi. "Start talking."<p>Nabiki crossed her arms and legs. "What do you think?' Nabiki snapped. "We got them pissed." She was sitting in the warden's office. "Obviously they decided to take out Ukyo first." She looked at Yasuhara. "Did you have the police check out the ramen shop?</p><p>The warden growled. "I'm asking the questions here." He began only to be stopped by Sargent Yasuhara.</p><p>"They found three men unconscious in the shop." The Sargent said. "They had guns." She looked at the warden. "Nabiki Tendo is one of our inside contacts." Yasuhara explained. "It's been the Tendo Gang that's been intercepting the drugs."</p><p>"You didn't tell him?" Nabiki asked in surprise.</p><p>"I asked not to be." The warden admitted. The sour expression on his face increased.</p><p>"The rot is that deep?" Nabiki asked curiously. "Yes, it must be." She answered herself. Nabiki uncrossed her arms and legs and leaned forward. "We've been working with the Sargent to crack a drug smuggling ring that was using the prison as a distribution point. Our plan was to get the smugglers angry enough to take direct action."</p><p>"Apparently it worked." The warden said dryly. "So they attacked Mr. Kuonji, that I can understand."</p><p>"Miss Kuonji." Corrected Nabiki.</p><p>The warden looked down at his desk. He picked up a photo. "This is a woman?"</p><p>"Good isn't she?" Nabiki replied.</p><p>The warden mumbled something under his breath. "Okay Miss Kuonji. That doesn't explain how SHE got here in the first place."</p><p>"Ever been to Nerima?" Asked Nabiki.</p><p>The warden's eye's opened wide. "That insane asylum?" He asked. The warden pinched his nose. "NWC?" He asked weakly.</p><p>"Founding member." Nabiki replied. "She may not be as good as Ranko but she's still damn good. I figure the pain and fear made her head to where she would feel safe. Here. To Ranko." She raised an eyebrow. "I'm surprised you've heard of them."</p><p>"I have a friend in the department." The warden replied. "I visited a few times. One time there was this thirty foot tall winged cow that was tearing up the city. The NWC took it down."</p><p>"Taro." Supplied Nabiki. "And he's a Minotaur not a cow." She looked at the warden. "My turn. How's Ukyo?"</p><p>"Not good, I'm afraid. The medic did the best she could but she's not a doctor." The warden replied. "The bullet needs to be removed. If we don't get her to a hospital soon." The warden didn't finish his statement. He didn't need to.</p><p>"So why haven't you?" Asked Nabiki in anger.</p><p>"Because your idiot sister and idiot cousin won't let anyone near her." Yasuhara replied. "They said they couldn't trust anyone from the prison." Suddenly there was a noise from the corridor outside the warden's door. The door smashed open.</p><p>Nabiki spun in her chair. "Daddy!" She exclaimed.</p><p>"I'm here baby." Soun cried. He rushed to Nabiki. Right behind him were Nodoka, Genma, Kasumi and Dr. Tofu. He wrapped Nabiki in his arms. Soun glared at Yasuhara. "How could you let this happen to my babies?"</p><p>"Me?" Yasuhara protested.</p><p>"Daddy." Nabiki said from the shelter of Soun's arms. "Ukyo is hurt. Badly."</p><p>Kasumi turned to Dr. Tofu. "You heard my sister." Kasumi said fiercely. "Go." Ono raced away.</p><p>"Go with him Daddy." Nabiki said. "Someone may try to hurt Akane and Ranma."</p><p>Soun released Nabiki. He stood quickly. "No one hurts my baby." For a moment Soun's head sprouted horns and a forked tongue lashed angrily from his mouth, then it returned to normal. "Let's go Genma." Soun charged out of the office. Genma right on his heels.</p><p>The warden wiped his face. "What was that?" He asked in a stunned voice.</p><p>"Daddy being pissed." Nabiki replied calmly. "You don't want to get Daddy pissed."</p><p>"Hang on Ukyo." Akane urged in a worried voice. "Just hang on." She looked at Ranma. She swallowed. "She's not responding to my voice anymore Ranma."</p><p>The medic took Ukyo's wrist in her hands. "Pulse is very weak." She pronounced. "You have to let us get her to the hospital. The bullet has to come out." She said to Ranma. "I can't do any more than I have."</p><p>Ranma pounded the door to the infirmary. "So someone can kill her out there?" She rasped angrily. "No. If Ukyo is going to die, it'll be surrounded by friends."</p><p>"She doesn't have to die." The medic said urgently. "Once she's in the ambulance we can stabilize her."</p><p>"You don't get it, do you?" Growled Ranma. "I can't trust any of you. I barely trust you."</p><p>"Ranma!" Came a voice through the door. "Open up."</p><p>"That's Daddy." Akane exclaimed excitedly. She walked to the door and raised her hands. A bright red glow formed around her hands. "Open the door Ranma."</p><p>Ranma nearly ripped the door off its' hinges opening the door. Soun, Genma and Ono nearly fell in. Ranma slammed the door behind them.</p><p>Ono rushed over to the unconscious chef. "Crap." He exclaimed. He placed the bag he was carrying on a chair next to the bed and opened it. Ono pulled out a syringe and a small bottle. He quickly injected the contents into Ukyo's arm. "I need four liters of plasma. Stat." The medic hurried away and quickly returned with an IV stand and four plastic bags. "Let me see them." Ono demanded. Dr. Tofu carefully checked the plasma bags and the IV needle. He nodded. "Hook her up."</p><p>"She's gonna be alright isn't she doc?" Ranma asked nervously.</p><p>"I hope so Ranma." Ono replied. "Now stay out of my way and let me do what I have to."</p><p>End Chapter 8</p><p>Author's Notes: Thank you for all the reviews and emails. I appreciate all the kind words, helpful criticisms and, yes, even the flames. I hope everyone sticks around for the rest of the story.</p><p>I don't want to get up on the soapbox in regards to Chapter 7. Anyone who is undecided over whether rape is a bad thing or not is not someone I wish to associate with. It's a bad thing. The question is; is it redeemable? You tell me.</p>
