</div><p>Part 2</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>'Water Rats'</p><p>"Good evening and welcome to Tokyo Tonight, I'm your host, Satchi Kato." The pretty reporter turned in her chair to face another camera. "Some people are born wealthy, some beautiful, some are talented in the arts or skilled at sports. Few are all." A picture appeared behind the reporter. "Lord Tatewaki Kuno." She said in introduction. "Heir to the Kuno fortune. Skilled martial artist, hollywood looks and a speaking style more suited to the theatre." The image changed as she spoke, showing Tatewaki in a business suit, swordsman's Hakuta and at a beach in swim trunks. The last picture was Tatewaki on his yacht. She turned in her chair. "Our topic tonight; Tatewaki Kuno, An in depth look at the life of the super wealthy. " She announced. "When we come back."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Captain." The watch officer saluted. "Our outriders report a ship closing in on our location."</p><p>"One ship?" Captain Osigi raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Yessir." The watch officer reported.</p><p>Captain Osigi smiled in anticipation. "Excellent." He said.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Private yacht, Captain." The pirate reported.</p><p>"Any other ships?" The pirate captain asked.</p><p>"Nothing on visual. Nothing on radar." The pirate replied with an anticipatory smile. "Go?" He asked.</p><p>The pirate captain nodded. "Go." He grinned evilly. .</p><p>"Aye Aye." Replied the pirate.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"The ship just picked up speed." Captain Osigi's tactical officer reported. "You called it Captain." The tactical officer said respectfully.</p><p>"Old habits die hard Ensign." The captain replied. Captain Osigi pressed a button on the arm of his command chair. "Lord Kuno, it begins."</p><p>"Acknowledged." Tatewaki's voice came from a speaker. "We'll be ready."</p><p>"I have no cause to doubt that, Lord Kuno." Captain Osigi replied. "Good hunting, My Lord."</p><p>"And you as well, Captain." Tatewaki's voice replied. "Tatewaki. Out."</p><p>Captain Osigi rubbed his mustache in anticipation. "Good hunting, indeed." He murmured. He pressed another button. "All hands, this is the Captain." He said. "Our guests are arriving." He said. "Let's give them a warm Kuno welcome, shall we?" He said. "Good hunting, all." Captain Osigi disconnected. "Ensign tell me when we're in range."</p><p>"Yes sir." The Ensign looked at his monitor intently. "On my mark." He said a minute later. "Mark."</p><p>"Acquisition." Sang out the weapons officer moments later.</p><p>"Helm, prepare to bring us around." Captain Osigi barked. "Weapons." His voice seemed to hum in anticipation. "Fire." His command was punctuated immediately by twin explosions as the yachts cannon fired. He pumped his fist as flames flared from the approaching ship. "Helm." The yacht seemed to almost stand on end as it executed a tight turn and began racing away.</p><p>The stricken pirate ship swerved and slowed as the helmsman fought to recover. Crewman ran around, those that could, putting out fires and removing debris. Other crewmen were manning cannon and automatic weaponry and fired uselessly after the fleeing ship.</p><p>The pirate captain marched along the deck barking orders. "Why isn't the fire put out yet?" He screamed. He climbed down a ladder into the hold of the ship. "How long before the engines are running again?"</p><p>"She's flooded, Captain." A voice yelled back grumpily. "Ten minutes."</p><p>"Captain." An voice shouted into the engine room. "We got visitors." Suddenly the sound of gunfire came to the pirate's ears and he raced out of the engine room. The pirate captain looked on in disbelief as his ship was attacked by men on jet skis.</p><p>Tatewaki and his men had been dropped off hours earlier from the yacht. The yacht had been converted to carry and drop off half a dozen modified jet skis and their two man crews. One man piloted the fast little craft and one to fire the assault weapon mounted on the rear. Like Indians surrounding a wagon train from an old western, or charioteers from the Roman colliseum, the jet skis circled the pirate vessel and fired continuously. The jet ski's had been painted a mottled green and blue and the ninja all wore uniforms designed to blend into the sea. Only after Captain Osigi had the pirates attention in front did they power up and chase from behind.</p><p>"I really wish you'd sit down, Master." Sasuke grumped as he piloted the agile little craft. "Your Ladies would never forgive me if you were hurt." Tatewaki laughed. Sasuke guided the jet ski toward the ship, zig-zagging as he went to evade returning gunfire from the ship. Once they reached the ship, an eager Tatewaki and somewhat less eager Sasuke leaped onto the deck of the pirate ship.</p><p>Once there, the swordsman and his ninja tore through the disorganized pirates with near impunity. Tatewaki moved so quickly that he seemed to be in several places at once. A pirate, who was one moment aiming his rifle at the back of Tatewaki's head, found the swordsman behind him. With unfortunate, at least from the pirate's point of view, results.</p><p>Tatewaki's sword flashed and left behind a trail of devastation. Most of the time Tatewaki's sword ripped through weapons, most of the time. Tatewaki had seen too much over the past two years to even consider mercy. Ting Li was only the first woman or girl they found on a pirate ship. Not the last. Drugs they had also found in plenty. Bought with the lives of their victims. The rest of Tatewaki's ninja's climbed on deck and swiftly disarmed the remaining pirates. The last to be captured was the pirate captain.</p><p>"Search the ship." Tatewaki ordered. He strode over to the pirate captain. "This is your lucky day, Captain." Tatewaki said coldly.</p><p>"Lucky?" The pirate captain snarled.</p><p>"Yes, lucky." Tatewaki replied. "None of my men were hurt. So it appears you will live." Tatewaki's sword was suddenly pressed against the pirates throat. "Don't make me regret my generosity."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Heaven's Scimitar has been sunk, Captain." Reported the tall man in angry tones. Known as One Eyed Wong for the patch he wore, he was Dou Gan Shou's second in command. "Who?" He demanded. "Who did this?"</p><p>"She did." Dou Gan Shou replied. "The Ice Queen. It must be." The burly and scarred pirate captain said positively.</p><p>One Eyed Wong looked at his Captain. "I don't understand your obsession with her. She's just a woman." He said in derision. "The way you talk, you'd think she was the queen of hell itself.</p><p>"Don't underestimate her." Snapped Dou Gan Shou."You weren't there." He said. "If I hadn't run across that fishing boat, I'd be dead right now." The Captain looked down at a map table. "Put out the word." He growled. "No ship is to attempt to take a ship alone. No matter how tempting." He said. "In fact, I want the remaining ships to be grouped into threes." He looked at his second. "You, me and Nguyen will make up one group." He continued. "Pick two men to command the remaining groups."</p><p>"All because of a woman and her rich boyfriend?" One Eyed Wong asked incredulously. "The men will think you're weak."</p><p>"Let them." Dou Gan Shou replied hotly. "In the meantime, has the girl been located?"</p><p>"Not yet." One Eyed Wong replied. "I don't know what the big deal is, she's just a girl." He said. "Millions more like her."</p><p>"Because I said so." Dou Gan Shou half shouted. "Besides I don't like the timing." The pirate took a breath. "First the girl goes missing and now the Ice Queen is taking an interest." The pirate captain smiled grimly. "And if the Ice Queen is taking an interest, we'll need a bargaining chip." He said. "Find her."</p><p>One Eyed Wong nodded his head and strode out of the Captain's cabin. 'Lost his nerve.' He decided as he walked. 'But it won't hurt to get the girl back.' One Eyed Wong returned to his own ship and gave some orders.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight, I'm your host, Satchi Kato." The reporter turned to face another camera. An image of three people, two women and one man, appeared behind her. "Since moving to Itabashi more than two years ago, the Terrible Three have become a familiar and welcome sight to the residents of this important community." She said. "According to police reports, Itabashi has become virtually crime free."</p><p>The reporter turned to another camera. "However, the Terrible Three have been notably absent over the past few weeks. Where are they? Are they in hiding? And why?" The reporter looked sombre. "Tonights Topic: Is a crime wave in Itabashi's future?" She asked. "But first, these messages."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema hummed happily to herself as she entered the kitchen. Another month had passed and she had become more comfortable living with the gods. As had become her habit the first thing she did was light some incense at a small Buddhist altar she had erected in one corner of the kitchen. After saying a quick prayer of thanks, she began making breakfast. 'Gods will be up soon.' She thought. Though Ranma, Akane and Ukyo had all, at one time or another, insisted they weren't gods, Pema persisted in believing they were. Especially Ranma.</p><p>The next thing Pema made was tea, before she began making breakfast in earnest. 'Hmm, must tell gods we need to go to market." She said to herself. She was just finishing preparing breakfast when Akane, as usual, stumbled into the kitchen first. Pema hurried over and guided Akane to the table and handed her a cup of tea before preparing a plate for the black haired goddess. She then placed mugs of tea on the table for Ranma and Ukyo just as they entered the kitchen. After seeing everyone fed, Pema made a plate for herself and sat down at the table. It still made her nervous having breakfast with the gods but they insisted.</p><p>"Good breakfast Pema." Akane said. She patted her flat stomach contentedly. The enthusiastic agreement from both Ukyo, especially Ukyo, and Ranma made Pema blush. Breakfast over and the table cleared everyone, though they needed to coax Pema, moved to the living room. "So what do we have planned for today?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I don't know about you guys," Ranma said. "But I feel like going for a run." He looked at Pema. "We go out, you stay, okay?"</p><p>Pema nodded. "Pema stay." She said. "Pema do clothes." Pema said. "Oh, we no have food." Pema said contritely. "Pema not make," She paused. "What word?" Pema seemed to mumble to herself. "D-dinner?" She said unsurely.</p><p>"Dinner." Agreed Ukyo. "Don't worry sugar, we'll bring back groceries." She walked over to Pema and handed her a cellphone. "Do you remember what we showed you?" She asked. Pema nodded. "Good." Ukyo said. She wagged a finger. "Now, don't work too hard." She admonished. "Get some sun, watch a movie, okay?" She waited until Pema nodded. "Good." She tousled the girl's hair.</p><p>Pema started sorting the dirty laundry while Ranma, Akane and Ukyo changed. 'Such tiny clothes.' Pema thought in amusement. The greatest thing in the apartment, as far as Pema was concerned, was the washer and dryer The first batch of clothing was in the washer when Ranma, Akane and Ukyo came out of the bedroom. Pema looked at the three in admiration. Dressed in loose black pants and black t-shirts that highlighted their sculpted physiques', Pema could even see a faint aura surrounding their bodies, they looked like the gods Pema thought they were. Pema followed the three to the roof. They waved goodbye to Pema and then with a mighty bound started bouncing along the rooftops. Pema waited until they were nearly out of sight before returning to the apartment.</p><p>Pema did the laundry, cleaned the kitchen, vacuumed and even dusted but there really wasn't a lot to do and she was quickly done. She passed a difficult but rewarding hour working on her Japanese language lessons before taking a break. 'Maybe movie.' She told herself. The second greatest thing, as far as Pema was concerned, was the entertainment center. She looked through the movie collection. Pema stopped at one that had the names of the gods written on it. With some anticipation she placed the DVD in the player and started the movie. Five minutes later she was staring open mouthed at the screen. "I don't think I should be watching this." Pema said to herself but she couldn't stop watching for several minutes more. Pema shook her head in disbelief. "Now I know they gods, mortals can't do that." She said. "Or that." She said a moment later. "And I don't think a mortal man is supposed to be that big." She giggled. "So vain."</p><p>With a final giggle, Pema turned off the video. Shaking her head in amusement she made her way to the roof of the apartment building. The residents of the apartment building had originally divided up sections of the rooftop for their personal use, though with the arrival of Ranma, Akane and Ukyo and the assorted people that would stop by, the building residents had become cautious about using the roof. There were a number of people sunning themselves but when they saw Pema sit in the section reserved for the Terrible Three, they began packing up. Pema didn't mind, she was still uncomfortable around most Japanese and privacy was a commodity she relished. She sat down in one of the three lounge chairs that were there, leaned back and closed her eyes.</p><p>Pema's eyes opened with a snap. "Oh no, I fell asleep." She said to herself. She looked at the sky and breathed a sigh of relief when she realized she had dozed for maybe an hour. She looked around the now empty rooftop. Pema stretched with a contented smile. Pema's eyes widened slightly. 'I don't remember the last time I was this happy.' She thought in wonder. Pema hurried downstairs and back into the apartment. She walked into the kitchen , lit some incense and placed it in the altar. She put her hands together. "Thank you." She said.</p><p>It was just approaching sunset when Ranma swung into the apartment from the outside window. "We're home." He called. Akane then Ukyo swung in behind him. Ukyo and Akane both carried bags of groceries. Pema came running out of the kitchen. She clapped her hands joyfully.</p><p>"Oh you back." Pema said happily. She hurried over and made to take the groceries. "Please, I take."</p><p>"It's okay, sugar." Ukyo laughed. She made her way into the kitchen and put the groceries on the counter. Akane put her bag on the counter as well. Ranma started putting away the groceries.</p><p>"I got some sea bass." Ukyo said to Pema. "That okay?" To Ukyo's surprise Pema hugged her. "Hey, it's just sea bass." Laughed Ukyo.</p><p>"Never have." Pema looked down in embarrassment.</p><p>"Really?" Ukyo said. "Well time to change that." Ukyo returned the hug. "Now be a good girl and set the table." Pema nodded and almost skipped away. "Nice to see the kid smile." Ukyo said.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema woke up early as was usual. She quickly, though sleepily, performed her morning ablutions before heading toward the kitchen. As she approached she heard the sound of music coming quietly from the kitchen. Pema frowned. She slowly opened the kitchen door and peeked inside. To her initial horror, Ranma, Akane and Ukyo were already in the kitchen. 'Oh no.' Pema thought in dismay. Her dismay quickly changed to disbelief and then an awe that bordered on jealousy as she watched the three 'gods' dancing around the room while making breakfast. Dancing being as good a description as Pema could make.</p><p>Pema watched as the three strode, slid, shimmied and spun in time to the music. Ukyo mostly stayed at the stove and Akane, mostly, stayed near the table, while Ranma moved from one girl to the other. Every so often Akane or Ukyo would join Ranma in doing a number of dance steps before returning to whatever chore they were doing. The three staying in constant motion. Pema pushed the door open further. Ranma was the first to notice her.</p><p>"Good Morning, Pema." Ranma half sang. "Breakfast will be done in a moment."</p><p>"But, but, that Pema job." Pema protested.</p><p>"Not today." Ukyo said cheerfully. "Today, you sit."</p><p>"Nah." Ranma replied. He performed an intricate dance step that brought him to the kitchen door. "Today, Pema dances." He said with a grin. Before Pema could react, Ranma took Pema's hand and spun her in a circle.</p><p>"But, but, but." Pema began only to find herself being spun around by Akane and then Ukyo. All the while breakfast continued to be made. To Pema's disbelief food, plates and utensils flew through the air. And still Pema found herself being made, not unpleasantly, to dance. Pema couldn't help it and she began to giggle.</p><p>"There we go." Akane crowed. "I knew there was a giggle in there somewhere." She smiled approvingly at Pema. "Now, you sit." She said. "Breakfast is served."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"You want me do what?" Pema  had been living with Ranma, Akane and Ukyo for nearly three months now. Pema's language skills had grown quickly and, while not fluent, could understand most of what was said and speak Japanese well enough to allow her to interact with others.</p><p>They still couldn't really explain why they wanted her there instead of a facility designed for such situations but they were determined not only to care for the teenage Tibetan girl but to introduce her, though under strict conditions, to Japanese society, starting with some of their closer associates. Dressed in a typical Japanese schoolgirl outfit, Pema looked like an equally typical teenager. She was still too thin but no longer painfully so and her return to health brought out her natural beauty. Her black hair hung in a silken wave that was tied with a bow. The way Akane used to wear it many years before.</p><p>"Babysit." Akane replied. "Well sorta." Akane smiled. "Look, there's this little girl, Kiko, she's seven." Akane said. Pema nodded. "She's staying at the mansion for a couple days as a reward." Akane said. Pema nodded again. "Her mother and Ms. Kuno are both very busy and would like someone to watch her when they're not there, understand?" Akane asked. Pema nodded hesitantly. "Don't worry." Akane said. "I'm sure you can handle a seven year old for a couple days."</p><p>Pema nodded. "I not fail you." She promised.</p><p>Ukyo stuck her head into Pema's room. "I got Kodachi on the phone." Ukyo held up a cell phone. "What do I tell her?"</p><p>"That Pema babysit." Pema said proudly.</p><p>End Chapter 1</p><p>Author's Notes: I'm ba-ack...Sorry for the delay.
