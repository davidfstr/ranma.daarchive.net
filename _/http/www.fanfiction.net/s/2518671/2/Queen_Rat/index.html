</div><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>'<b>Old and New friends'</b></p><p><b>The following morning, Ranma, Akane and Nabiki went to the showers to bathe. Ranma nervously eyed the shower heads and tried to hide behind Akane. They made their way to the far end of the bathing area. Akane waved Ranma away as she turned on the shower. She stood under it and adjusted the faucets. "I think this will be okay." She said finally. Ranma walked over and stuck her hand under the running water. It was warm but not warm enough to trigger the transformation. She nodded and let the water sluice over her. Akane and Nabiki each took the shower to either side of Ranma.</b></p><p>"<b>Remember," Akane hissed in a whisper to Ranma. "No ogling."</b></p><p>"<b>I'm not ogling." Ranma whispered back. "I'm just looking around."</b></p><p>"<b>Well you can ogle me, if you want." Nabiki said. "What do you think Ranma?" She turned to face Ranma and stood with her hands on her hips. Who's better built; me or Akane?"</b></p><p>"<b>Nabiki!" Akane squeaked. "Next time you're showering next to me."</b></p><p>"<b>Well since I'm not," Nabiki turned her back on Ranma. "Do my back."</b></p><p>"<b>Do it and you die, Ranma." Akane snarled. She joined Ranma. She shivered under the much cooler water. 'Note to self, start showering in cooler water, we may need to change showers or shower together.' Akane picked up a sponge and soaped it. "Ranma will do my back and I'll do hers. I'll do your back." She pressed the soapy sponge against Nabiki's back with just a little more force than necessary. </b></p><p><b>Nabiki staggered slightly. "Okay. Okay. I was joking."</b></p><p>"<b>Sure you were." Akane replied. She soaped Nabiki's back thoroughly. Akane smiled as Ranma started washing her back. A few seconds later Ranma leaned forward.</b></p><p>"<b>Akane," She whispered nervously. "People are staring at us."</b></p><p><b>Akane glanced up. She shot a glare at several of the more obvious oglers. They quickly looked away. "Okay now they're not." </b></p><p><b>Ranma chuckled. "Thanks Tomboy."</b></p><p><b>After finishing their morning shower, the three women got dressed and headed to the prison cafeteria. It was about what they expected. The food was limited in variety but basically nutritious. They joined the line and eventually got a table. They sat as far away from the other prisoners as possible. Mostly for privacy.</b></p><p><b>Nabiki leaned forward. "Hey Ranma." She said quietly. "Were you serious about going into town for stuff?"</b></p><p><b>Ranma shrugged. "I've gotten out of worse."</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah, but not quietly." Akane elbowed Ranma in the ribs. "What are you thinking sis?"</b></p><p>"<b>I'm thinking that someone who is known to be able to get things is going to have an advantage." Nabiki smiled shark-like. "We may even be able to make a small profit."</b></p><p>"<b>Told ya." Ranma said to Akane. "Let's take a walk around after we eat." She said. "Let's see what this place has to offer."</b></p><p><b>Ranma and Akane walked through the prison. It was a typical modern prison. A series of levels that rose eight stories. The lowest level contained a cafeteria, a gym, library and even an area containing a large television. A door at one end led toward the guard area. The levels above contained individual cells, arranged in a circular manner overlooking a central space. The highest levels contained cells holding the more violent prisoners. The Tokyo Women's Correctional Facility may have been a medium security prison but it did have need to separate some of the prisoners from the general populace. Ranma looked up. A slow smile came to her face.</b></p><p><b>Akane followed Ranma's gaze. "You're kidding, right?"</b></p><p><b>Ranma chuckled. "Let's keep looking around." </b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ukyo Kuonji carefully cleaned the grill in Uk-chans; One of the many daily chores necessary for the care and upkeep of a busy restaurant. "Busy." Mused Ukyo. "Busy is good. I don't have to think when I'm busy." Ukyo put down the scraper she was using and sighed. "I miss him." She said. "Heck, I even miss Akane."</b><p><b>The bell over the front door of the restaurant tinkled and Ukyo looked up. "Kasumi?" She said questioningly as she recognized the oldest of the three Tendo sisters.</b></p><p>"<b>Hello Ukyo." Kasumi said pleasantly. </b></p><p>"<b>Not that I'm not happy to see you sugar." Ukyo said. "But why are you here?" Ukyo's faced paled. "He's alright, isn't he?"</b></p><p>"<b>Ranma is fine." The older girl assured Ukyo. "Nodoka and I were planning on going to see the three of them this weekend and we wondered if you'd like to go with us."</b></p><p>"<b>I'd love to." Ukyo replied sadly. "But Ranma made it clear he wants nothing to do with me."</b></p><p><b>Kasumi placed her hands on her hips. "Now you know that's not true." Kasumi said firmly. "You're Ranma's oldest friend. He'd be thrilled to see you." Kasumi walked over to the counter and sat down. "I understand your feelings." Kasumi said gently. "But you must let it go. Ranma has chosen and you must respect his choice."</b></p><p>"<b>How can I?" Ukyo's voice choked slightly. "I love him."</b></p><p>"<b>I know that Ukyo." Kasumi reached across the counter and squeezed Ukyo's hand. "We all know that." Kasumi released Ukyo's hand. "But Ranma loves my sister, even you must realize that by now."</b></p><p><b>Ukyo swallowed. "I would have been good to him." She said in a hoarse voice. </b></p><p>"<b>No one disagrees Ukyo." Kasumi smiled sympathetically. "But would you have been good to her?" </b></p><p>"<b>Her?"</b></p><p><b>Kasumi just smiled. "Come with us Ukyo." </b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki's privacy ended the following afternoon. She was idly leafing through a magazine she had been given when the sound of footsteps made her look up. One of the guards was escorting another prisoner. "Heads up Tendo." The guard said. "Your roomy has arrived." She waved the newcomer into the cell. "In you go."</b><p><b>The new prisoner was, in Nabiki's opinion, in her mid-twenties, tall and very attractive or would have been except for her extremely short hair and the hard look on the woman's face. Nabiki sat back and waited to see which way the woman would jump. Nabiki made a bet with herself.</b></p><p>"<b>Out of my bunk sweetmeat." The young woman growled. </b></p><p>'<b>Bingo.' Thought Nabiki. "If I were you," Nabiki said coldly. "I'd be very, very quiet. I had a bad week."</b></p><p><b>The woman snorted. "Tough." The woman replied. "Let's get one thing straight." She said. "I'm in charge here." She walked over and made to poke Nabiki in the chest to emphasize her point. The next thing the woman knew she was staring up at the ceiling.</b></p><p>"<b>Let's try that again." Nabiki said in the same cold tones. "I've had a very, very bad week." Nabiki's smile was icy cold. "If I were you I'd take the top bunk."</b></p><p><b>The woman looked into Nabiki's eyes. She swallowed. "Yeah, bad week. Top bunk. Sure, no problem." She babbled. When Nabiki stepped away the young woman scrambled to her feet and retreated to the cell door. Nabiki sat down on the bottom bunk and resumed reading her magazine. After a minute she looked up. The young woman was still standing by the cell door.</b></p><p><b>Nabiki smiled to herself and looked down at the magazine. "You learn fast." She commented without looking up. "I like that." She turned a page in the magazine. "What's your name?"</b></p><p>"<b>Ota." The woman replied with a trace of quaver in her voice. "Kimi Ota."</b></p><p>"<b>Well Kimi Ota." Nabiki replied. "My name is Nabiki Tendo." The sounds of running feet made Nabiki look up and Kimi jump into the cell. Ranma and Akane burst in. Ranma gave Kimi a cold look as she entered.</b></p><p>"<b>We heard your roommate arrived." Ranma said.</b></p><p>"<b>Everything's fine Ranko." Nabiki replied calmly. "Kimi Ota, this is my cousin Ranko Tendo and my sister Akane Tendo." She said. "We were just getting acquainted, right Kimi?"</b></p><p>"<b>Uh, yeah right Nabiki." Kimi replied. "Getting acquainted."</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kimi Ota lay in the top bunk. Lights out had occurred over an hour ago but she was unable to sleep. She kept replaying the events earlier in the day. 'I never saw anyone move that fast.' She thought. She rolled over. "Tendo." She called quietly. "You awake?"</b><p>"<b>What do you want Ota?" Nabiki replied in the darkness.</b></p><p>"<b>Look about before, it was nothing personal." Kimi began. "It was just," Kimi paused. "You gotta understand, in here you have to be strong."</b></p><p>"<b>Been here before, have you?" Nabiki's voice came in the darkness.</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah." Kimi replied. "You?"</b></p><p>"<b>First time." </b></p><p><b>Kimi could hear the amusement in Nabiki's voice. "Really?" Kimi said. "After what you did before, what was that anyway?"</b></p><p>"<b>Family martial art." Nabiki said. "Compared to my sister and Ranko, I'm an amateur." </b></p><p>"<b>You're kidding?" Kimi rolled on to her back. "Whoa." Kimi shivered. "For a moment there I thought you were about to tear me a new asshole."</b></p><p>"<b>For a moment I was going to do just that." Nabiki replied. "Sorry."</b></p><p>"<b>Sorry?" Kimi said in amazement. "Girl, you're never sorry for being strong. In here you're either strong or someone's bitch."</b></p><p>"<b>Don't worry Kimi." Nabiki chuckled. "I don't swing that way."</b></p><p>"<b>No?" Kimi replied. "I said that the first time too."</b></p><p>"<b>Get some sleep Kimi." Nabiki said after a long pause. "We'll talk more in the morning."</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Four very attractive young women entered the dining hall. Nabiki was in the lead, Kimi Ota a step behind. Ranma and Akane walked together talking. After a couple days of 'rooming' with Nabiki, Kimi found she actually liked Nabiki. She quickly realized that there was a first class brain hiding behind the woman's good looks and aristocratic manner. 'I think I may have lucked out.' Kimi thought to herself.</b><p><b>Kimi looked around and then suddenly stiffened. "Nabiki." She whispered urgently. "Trouble."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki picked up a tray and some utensils. "What kind of trouble?" Nabiki asked calmly.</b></p><p>"<b>Bull dyke trouble." Kimi replied. She indicated the location with a small shake of her head. </b></p><p><b>Nabiki casually glanced in the indicated direction. So too did Ranma and Akane. Approaching them were three large tough looking women. The one in the lead reminded Ranma a bit of the Amazon that Shampoo had fought in China when they first met. 'Cept she doesn't look as smart.' Ranma smiled to herself.</b></p><p>"<b>Let me handle them." Akane almost begged. "I need something to hit."</b></p><p>"<b>Heh." Ranma chuckled. "Be my guest." She said and gave a half bow.</b></p><p>"<b>No." Nabiki said suddenly. "They're mine." Kimi nodded to herself as if it were obvious to her that Nabiki could and would handle it.</b></p><p>"<b>You?" Chorused Ranma and Akane. "No offense sis." Akane continued. "But you haven't really trained in years."</b></p><p>"<b>None taken." Nabiki replied. "But if a Tendo can't handle those three, she doesn't deserve to be in the family." Nabiki smiled slightly. "Besides I want to keep you and Ranko in reserve in case a real problem comes up." Nabiki's expression changed. "Please sis, this is something I have to do."</b></p><p><b>Akane looked into Nabiki's eyes. "Okay sis." Akane said finally. "But if she hurts you, I'll make sure she'll wish she was never born."</b></p><p>"<b>I wouldn't expect less." Nabiki said. She handed Kimi her tray and then turned to face the approaching women.</b></p><p>"<b>Well lookee here." Said the central woman, obviously the leader. "New meat."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki rolled her eyes. "Why does everyone use the word 'meat' when they first meet me?" She complained. "Why not 'flower' or 'jewel'? Heck I'd even settle for sugar." She looked at the woman in front of her. "Now you on the other hand have at least a passing resemblance to a cow." The three women behind her suppressed a snort.</b></p><p>"<b>What did you say?" Growled the woman angrily.</b></p><p>"<b>Moo." Replied Nabiki. She never took her eyes off the woman. When the first punch was launched she was ready and blocked it easily. She stepped forward and kicked the big woman in the gut. The woman bent over in pain and Nabiki, using the woman's shoulders as a platform for her hands, jumped and kicked out to the sides catching the woman's two cronies in the faces. She dropped to the ground and raised her knee sharply then stepped back. The three women crashed to the ground in unison.</b></p><p>"<b>Not bad Nabs." Ranma said in approval.</b></p><p>"<b>Well she is a Tendo." Akane said. She grinned at her sister proudly. "Way to go sis."</b></p><p>"<b>Hey Nabiki." Called Kimi. She held up two trays. "I got you something to eat." She said. "I didn't know what you liked, so I got you an assortment." She looked at the three women on the ground. "Satoh is going to be mad when she wakes up." Kimi said. She smiled a little viciously. "Good." She handed the tray to Nabiki.</b></p><p>"<b>Thanks Kimi." Nabiki looked at the contents of the tray. "This all they had?"</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah, sorry Nabiki." Replied Kimi.</b></p><p>"<b>Not complaining just commenting." Nabiki led the way to a table and sat down just as a group of prison guards reached the unconscious women. One guard turned to stare at Nabiki. Nabiki returned the look coolly. The guard approached.</b></p><p>"<b>Now that she had coming." The guard said. "I hope this isn't going to be a habit Tendo." </b></p><p>"<b>I won't be the one starting anything." Nabiki replied easily. "But I'm nobody's punching bag."</b></p><p>"<b>If you do, you'll spend ten days in the hole. Consider this a warning." The guard looked back at the three women now being helped to their feet. She turned back to Nabiki. "You're Soun Tendo's daughter, aren't you?"</b></p><p>"<b>You know my father?" Nabiki raised an eyebrow.</b></p><p><b>The guard nodded. "Yeah, Soun used to teach basic martial arts skills to corrections officers. I was one of his students. Too bad he stopped teaching."</b></p><p>"<b>Well Daddy had some problems to work out." Nabiki replied. "But he still managed to teach me a little."</b></p><p><b>The guard gave Nabiki a hard stare. "What rank are you?" She asked finally.</b></p><p><b>Nabiki shrugged. "I never really tested for rank." Nabiki replied. "But it is hard to not pick up something if you're, well, Soun Tendo's daughter." She pointed to Akane. "This is my baby sister Akane, and that's Ranko my cousin." Ranma and Akane nodded politely. "Don't worry, I won't cause any trouble."</b></p><p><b>The guard smiled. "See that you don't." She looked at Kimi Ota. "I see you found someone to watch your back this time Ota." The guard turned back to Nabiki. "Soun always told me I was one of his better students. It's hard to find decent competition."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki kicked Ranma's leg under the table. "Well, I don't know if I'd be decent competition but I wouldn't mind sparring a little."</b></p><p><b>The guard's smile widened. "I thought you might. My name is Yasuhara, Sargent Yasuhara." She turned away. "See you around Tendo." She called over her shoulder.</b></p><p>"<b>Would you mind telling me why you had to do the fighting?" Akane asked.</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah and why did you kick me?" Ranma grumped. "The tomboy and I coulda used the workout too ya know."</b></p><p>"<b>I told you. I want to keep you in reserve." Nabiki replied. "I want them paying attention to me, not you." She smiled. "The trick now is to make sure they don't pay too much attention." Nabiki's smile turned into a shark-like grin. "Besides it doesn't hurt to have a tough guy reputation in here. Right Kimi?"</b></p><p><b>Kimi smiled at Nabiki. "Right." She said. "Chief." She added a moment later.</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>What did Yasuhara mean, when she said you found someone to watch your back this time, Kimi?" Nabiki asked. It was early evening and she and Kimi were in their cell. </b><p><b>Kimi grimaced. "Remember I told you about being strong or being someone's bitch?" Kimi's hand clenched into a fist. "You don't know how happy I was to see Satoh eat the floor like that." She looked up. "I owe you one."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki waved a hand in dismissal. "Forget it." Nabiki tapped her chin with her finger. "I'm bored." She said finally. "What is there to do around here?"</b></p><p>"<b>Do you play Shogi?" Asked Kimi.</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kigomi Satoh was not happy. 'Damn that Tendo bitch.' She thought to herself. She looked around at the private cell she currently occupied. The Hole. Satoh punched the cot. "One lucky shot and my reputation is ruined." She growled. "Who'd of thought that skinny bitch knew how to fight?" She punched the cot again.</b><p><b>Satoh stood up and started pacing the length of the short cell. "Ten days bitch." She snarled to the empty cell. "Ten days and then your ass is mine."</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The next morning, after breakfast, Nabiki and Kimi were in their cell. Akane and Ranma were walking around, though Nabiki knew that both of them were not far away. 'Not until they're sure Kimi is safe.' Nabiki thought. Nabiki had already formed a partial opinion. She wasn't 'safe' but she also wasn't a danger, whether she could be counted upon to remain that way was still open. 'Okay, what do I know about her?' Nabiki thought to herself. 'She's smart.' She looked up from the table where she and Kimi were playing a game of Shogi. 'Too smart in some things.' She sat back. "You win." Nabiki shook her head. "That's one each."</b><p><b>Kimi grinned. "Thanks Nabiki." She looked at the board. "I can't tell you the last time I had to work that hard to win." She looked at Nabiki and raised an eyebrow. "Again?"</b></p><p><b>Nabiki waved a hand. "Maybe later." She started putting the board away. 'Smart. I like smart.' Nabiki held up one of the pieces and looked at it. "Tell me Kimi." Nabiki said. "What do people want around here?" She asked. "Other than not being here of course."</b></p><p><b>Kimi gave a bark of laughter. "Of course." She rubbed her cheek thoughtfully. "Do you mean things?" Nabiki nodded. "Well, basically everything they can't get." Kimi shrugged. "This place has a small commissary but the selection is pretty limited." She replied. "Why?"</b></p><p><b>Nabiki ignored the question. "What kind of things especially?" Nabiki persisted. </b></p><p><b>Kimi raised an eyebrow at Nabiki's evasion. 'She thinks she can get things in here.' She thought in suppressed excitement. She looked around furtively then leaned closer. "Look if its drugs you're talking about," She began only to be cut off by Nabiki.</b></p><p>"<b>No drugs." Nabiki said sharply. "No drugs, no cigarettes, no booze." To Nabiki's surprise the look on Kimi's face was more relieved than anything.</b></p><p>"<b>You mean that?" Kimi asked. Nabiki nodded. "Good, cause there's enough drugs here already. There's always plenty of drugs." The last said with some anger. "What people really want in here is," Kimi scratched her scalp. "Luxuries." She said finally. "You know, chocolates, perfume, shampoo, that kind of thing." She said. "Good soap." She added feelingly. "The stuff here is no better than detergent." </b></p><p>"<b>Makes sense." Nabiki agreed. 'She's going to be my roommate for at least the next eighteen months.' Nabiki finished putting away the shogi set. 'Practical.' She added to her mental checklist. 'But can I trust her?'</b></p><p><b>Kimi's excitement grew. She always prided herself on being able to read people. She liked what she read in the brunette's face. 'I think she really can do it.' Kimi realized. "I want in." Kimi said suddenly. </b></p><p>"<b>In?" Nabiki inquired coyly. 'Quick on the uptake. I'm beginning to like this woman.'</b></p><p>"<b>In." Repeated Kimi. Kimi spread her hands to the sides as she spoke. "You're going to need me to keep my mouth shut at the very least." She said firmly. "I'm very good at keeping my mouth shut."</b></p><p>"<b>Are you now?" Nabiki smiled slightly.</b></p><p><b>Kimi nodded firmly. "Look Chief." Kimi said. "We're going to be stuck together in this little room for a long time. Any scam you plan on trying is going to go a hell of a lot easier if I'm working with you and not against you." She spread her hand apart again. "Look, you don't know me, I'm the outsider, I accept that." Kimi shrugged slightly. "But I smell opportunity."</b></p><p>"<b>A girl after my own heart." Nabiki said in approval. "How does ten percent of the profit sound?"</b></p><p><b>Kimi smiled. "Sounds okay, but twenty-five percent sounds a lot better." She replied. "Though twenty-five percent of nothing is still nothing."</b></p><p>"<b>Oh I think I can do better than that." Nabiki replied airily. 'Didn't take the first offer.' Nabiki suppressed a pleased smile. 'And came back with a reasonable counter.'</b></p><p>"<b>Can you now?" Kimi smirked slightly. 'Didn't blink on my counter offer.' She thought to herself. 'Probably what she was willing to offer anyway.' Kimi found she was enjoying herself immensely. </b></p><p><b>Nabiki nodded. Nabiki tapped her lower lip with a finger. 'She's right I have to trust her or forget about the whole idea.' She nodded again as she came to a decision. "Remember I told you that compared to my sister, I'm an amateur?" Kimi nodded. "Well I exaggerated. Compared to my sister I'm a rank beginner and Ranko is even better than my sister." She smiled proudly. "If they wanted to they could walk out of here and no one would be able to stop them." Nabiki grinned. "Or even know they left."</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah?" Kimi said dubiously. "So why haven't they?"</b></p><p>"<b>Honor." Nabiki replied. "They live and breathe by it. They were sentenced to eighteen months so they'll serve eighteen months." Nabiki winked at Kimi. "But that doesn't mean the two of them wouldn't decide to take a short vacation from here every so often."</b></p><p>"<b>You're serious." Kimi said in awe. She leaned closer to Nabiki. "Look we can get jobs here. The state pays us a small salary based on the hours we work and the jobs we do. If the four of us pool our money together we should have some startup capital in no time." She stopped as Nabiki's grin threatened to split her head in half. "What?"</b></p><p>"<b>You know Kimi, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." Nabiki replied.</b></p><p><b>End Chapter 2</b></p><p><b>Authors Notes; Well the reaction to Queen Rat was more positive than I expected. Thanks for all the reviews. I was happy to see the names of some old friends among the reviewers. Anyway, a little confession. The idea of Queen Rat, or at least the idea of Nabiki being in prison, came from reading the work of Zombie Boy. He mentioned, almost in passing, in one story (forgive me for not remembering the name) that Nabiki spent time in prison. He, however, did not do anything with the idea. I thought the idea was great and so, Queen Rat was born.</b></p><p><b>I have no clue as to how long Queen Rat will run. I never do when I start these things. Chapters will be released when ready and not under any set schedule. But I will do my best to not let too much time pass between chapters. As usual, expect the unexpected. And, above all, enjoy the ride.</b></p>
