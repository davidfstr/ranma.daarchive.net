</div><p>Chapter 8</p><p>'Wo Ah Ni'</p><p>Hikaru looked at the three figures sprawled bonelessly on the stage. "That was easy." He commented in contempt. The three figures suddenly sat up. "What the,?"</p><p>"Hi." Ukyo chirped.</p><p>"Impossible." Hikaru gasped in disbelief. "I hit you with three blasts. Three. You should be dead."</p><p>"If you had actually hit us you'd probably be right." Ranma said in a near monotone. Ranma raised his hands and then suddenly thrust them at Hikaru. Another soundless whump filled the bar and Hikaru went flying backwards. Ranma turned his head. "Hello Shampoo."</p><p>"Hello Airen." Shampoo replied calmly. She looked at Akane and Ukyo. "We fight?"</p><p>"If you want." Akane said in a voice as cold as Ranma's. "Personally I'd rather you just leave Japan."</p><p>"Can't." Shampoo replied. "Not unless great-grandmother say." She bowed slightly to Akane. "Another time?" She said and then seemed to vanish.</p><p>Hikaru shook his head and slowly stood up. He saw Ranma approaching. "You're all alone Hikaru baby." The half naked redhead said. "Shampoo is gone."</p><p>"So what?" Growled Hikaru. "I don't need the bitch to beat you."</p><p>"No?" Ranma purred. "Maybe not." She conceded. "But against the three of us?" Ranma waved a manicured hand.</p><p>'The faggot's right.' Hikaru thought. Hikaru stomped the floor causing an explosion that shook the entire club. Any patron who had regained their feet found themselves back on the floor again. Ranma, Akane and Ukyo staggered but remained standing. When the shaking stopped Hikaru was gone.</p><p>"After him." Shouted Ranma. Three half-naked women raced out of the club.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"This is Sumi Chiba reporting from Sapporo." The pretty reporter said in barely suppressed excitement. "Earlier this afternoon the police were called to the Susukino to investigate an explosion in a local club. When they arrived they found this." Her image was replaced by an recorded image of the front of the Gold Club. The picture showed the frosted front windows shattered and the door lying half off it's hinges. The picture was replaced by an image inside the club. Tables overturned and the mirror behind the bar shattered. The image returned to the reporter. "Amazingly no one was hurt. Soon after, reports came in of explosions in Odori Park." The reporter pressed her hand against her ear. "We have a report from our eye in the sky." She said. "Gojiro Takahashi reports." The image shifted to a still of a reporter while the sound of helicopter rotors filled the air.<p>"Thank you Sumi." Came the voice of the reporter almost yelling over the rotors. "The scene below is almost too fantastic to be believed." He said excitedly. The still picture was replaced with a live shot from the air of Odori Park. Grainy overhead images of three half naked women could be seen chasing a man through the manicured park. The three women were throwing what appeared to be balls of energy at the fleeing man. Even as the image rolled the fleeing man stopped turned and launched his own barrage of balls of energy. The watchers could see the energy balls impact an invisible shield that surrounded the women. "Wow." Came the Gojiro Takahashi's voice. "Did you see that?"</p><p>"We saw it Gojiro." Sumi Chiba's voice replied.</p><p>The fleeing figure jumped into the lower branches of a tree, a height that must have been at least ten feet. A moment later the figure was seen jumping from the top of the tree to the next tree. It seemed the man barely grazed the topmost branches before leaping onward. The three women stopped and then they too leaped into the trees. The chase continued along the tree tops, sometimes reversing direction, sometimes the combatants jumped and spun over each other's heads while all the time they threw balls of chi or exchanged quick blows. The helicopter camera image swung dizzily as the pilot struggled to keep up.</p><p>Other helicopters flew over the park, the Sapporo police department had arrived on the scene. These helicopters sported powerful spot lights that lit up the park below. Even though the pilots of these helicopters were veterans of many an aerial chase they also struggled to keep up with the figures below.</p><p>The reporter's helicopter cameras picked up the arrival of the helicopters and the police cars that were converging on the park. Members of the Sapporo police department could be seen running into the park. A radio warning forced them to give up their chase and the video of the battle below was suddenly cut off and replaced with Sumi Chiba's opened mouth expression. It took repeated prompting over her ear piece before she straightened and faced the camera. "It appears," She paused and swallowed. "Thank you Gojiro Takahashi for that incredible footage."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>'Heheheheheh." Chortled Ranma in a strange voice. "It's wabbit season."<p>"Duck season." Akane chirped back.</p><p>"Wabbit season." Ranma returned. She, Akane and Ukyo all launched bolts of energy toward the fleeing Nakamura. One ball of chi exploded close to Hikaru and knocked him out of the tree he was in. "Good shot Uk-chan." Ukyo pumped her fist into the air.</p><p>"Uh oh." Akane said. "The Police have arrived." She pointed. "And Hikaru is still moving." Akane said grimly. "We have to stop him now before someone gets hurt." Akane leaped to the ground and resumed the chase.</p><p>"The only one that's gonna get hurt is Hikaru." Ranma said to Ukyo. Ukyo nodded. The two leaped to the ground and followed Akane. A thunderbolt split the night sky illuminating the park in an actinic blue light.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru bounded along the tree lined park. 'Shit.' He thought. 'I can take the faggot but not with his two dykes backing him up.' For the first time Hikaru regretted Shampoo's absence. 'Stupid bitch.' He grumbled. Hikaru dodged behind a statue to catch his breath. Hikaru heard a sizzling sound and then a nearly simultaneous blast of lightning and thunder. 'Close.' He thought.<p>Hikaru pulled more air into his lungs and gathered his chi and felt his strength return. "Yeah." He stretched his arms and bent his back. "Yeah." He said again as he straightened. Hikaru dropped his arms and curled his fists and a light blue glow appeared around his fists. Suddenly Hikaru leaped into the air. He spun in mid air and unleashed a powerful barrage of chi at the approaching three figures forcing them to dodge wildly.</p><p>Another thunderbolt split the sky.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"This is Sumi Chiba reporting on the amazing happenings in Odori Park tonight." The pretty reporter said into the camera. "For those who've tuned in late; after responding to reports of an explosion in the Susukino, the Police then found themselves in the middle of a fairytale battle in Odori Park." Grainy overhead images appeared in split screen with the reporter. The images showed four figures engaged in a titanic battle. Balls of energy could be seen shooting from the hands of all the participants and the park ground itself seemed to have been torn apart as if by an earthquake. The screen went white and the sound of thunder was heard through the recording. "It was at this moment that the Police and our own sky reporter were forced to return to their hangers." The screen returned to a full image of the reporter. "According to our meteorologist Ayako Oh, this storm was unexpected."<p>The image changed to another pretty young woman with glasses. "That's right Sumi." The meteorologist said. A weather map appeared behind her. "This is the doppler image just before the first reports came in." She waved her hands. "As you can see from the image the evening was calm." The image changed showing, in green, a small swirling mass just over Chiba park. "This was an hour later." The image changed again. This time the green swirling image was larger, almost obscuring the park. "And this is now." The meteorologist looked at the monitor. "That's ridiculous." She said almost to herself. She shook herself. "I mean, it's very unusual." She said quickly.</p><p>The image returned to Sumi Chiba. "Ayako will continue to monitor this unusual weather pattern. Just as we will continue to report on the battle in the park." She said. "But first, a word from our sponsor."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Knock it off you guys." Ukyo screamed over the thunder. "I'm not dressed for rain." She complained. "Like they care." Ukyo grumbled to herself.<p>Ranma and Akane dropped out of the Soul of Ice. If Akane experienced any psychic pain it wasn't noticeable. 'I'm where I belong.' Akane thought. 'And I'm doing what I should be doing.' She turned her head from side to side to look at Ranma then Ukyo. "And with the people I should be doing it with." She said aloud. "Sorry Uk-chan." She yelled over a roll of thunder.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>They finally cornered Hikaru at the base of a rain slicked statue. Ranma strolled closer. "You don't learn Hikaru." Ranma said. "I'm the best."<p>"Best?" Sneered Hikaru. "Three of you and I still held you off." Hikaru's chest heaved as he gulped air into his oxygen depleted lungs. The rain slicked his hair to his scalp.</p><p>"That's why I'm the best baby." Ranma purred. "Because I'm not stupid." She said easily. "Where's Shampoo Hikaru?"</p><p>"Who cares?" Hikaru snapped back</p><p>"See, there's your problem right there." Ranma replied. "If she were my partner, I'd care." Ranma tossed her head. "Like I said stupid." She came even closer. Ranma laughed. "Enjoying the view Hikaru baby?"</p><p>"Fuck you." The gangster spat.</p><p>"I told you before; you're not my type." Ranma sneered in return. "Now here is how it's gonna go down." Ranma became serious. "You let yourself get arrested. When you escape later, you will leave Japan." She said. "Or it ends here and now." Ranma raised her arms. Akane and Ukyo shifted their stances to match Ranma's.</p><p>"Bring it on bitch." Hikaru let his chi build. "I'll take option b." He raised his arms and his chi built even stronger.</p><p>Suddenly something dropped from the top of the statue and landed behind Hikaru. A hazy blur surrounded Hikaru that moved too quickly to be identified. Just as suddenly the blur stopped and Shampoo was standing behind Hikaru. The gangster swayed for a moment then collapsed to the ground. Shampoo dropped the bottle in her hand. The sound of it's shattering was loud in the sudden silence. Shampoo looked down at the motionless Hikaru Nakamura. She spit on his unconscious body. "When he wake he not remember last two years. He be weaker." She said without looking up.</p><p>"Why?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"You know I there, yes?" Shampoo asked instead. Ranma nodded. "I heard what you say." She said. "You speak to me." Ranma nodded again. "That why."</p><p>Shampoo walked over to Ranma and put her arms around the redhead's neck. She looked down at Ranma and there appeared to be a struggle going on just below the surface. Finally Shampoo sighed. "Wo Ah Ni, Airen." Shampoo said softly. She leaned down and kissed Ranma on the lips. It was a quick kiss.</p><p>Shampoo dropped her arms and walked over to Akane and Ukyo. "You only keeping his bed warm until he come to senses, you know that." She said.</p><p>"Sure Shampoo." Akane replied. "What are your plans?"</p><p>"Thought maybe stay in Hokkaido, Hokodate maybe." Shampoo replied. "Great grandmother be angry but she not hurt me."</p><p>"Got money?" Ukyo asked. "What am I saying?" Ukyo snorted. "You wouldn't be you if you hadn't stashed something away by now."</p><p>"Still not know what Airen see in either one of you." Shampoo said. "But at least you smart." She smiled. "I be okay."</p><p>"Don't be afraid to contact Nabiki if you need something." Akane said. She shrugged at Shampoo's look. "Trust me, she has a soft spot for you." She said. "Just don't call us." Shampoo smiled and seemed to vanish into the darkness. "Come on guys." Akane said. "Let's get out of here before we have to do some explaining."</p><p>"How come she wasn't a cat?" Ukyo asked as they raced away.</p><p>"Waterproof soap probably." Ranma replied. "Or something the old ghoul cooked up." She said. "Who knows?"</p><p>"Who cares?" Akane added.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hey Mr Chiba." Ranma said as she, Akane and Ukyo returned to the club. "Sorry about your club." She said contritely. She handed the stunned club manager a card. "When you figure out how much it'll cost to fix everything, call this number." She said. "The Ice Queen will reimburse you."<p>"Just don't pad the total too much." Akane added. "She will check." She said emphatically. "Come on guys, let's get our stuff and go." The three disappeared into the dressing room. When they emerged, Genji Chiba blinked. Instead of three women it was now two women and one man.</p><p>"Wh-who are you?" He asked. "And where's Usagi?"</p><p>"Right here Mr. Chiba." Ranma pointed a thumb at his chest. Genji Chiba blinked again. "Come on girls, let's get the rest of our stuff from the hotel." He said. "We can catch a midnight train north."</p><p>"North Ranma?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Well yeah." Ranma replied. "I did promise you girls a couple days at a spa."</p><p>Akane grinned. "Just like old times, huh Uk-chan?" She said as she looped an arm through Ranma's.</p><p>Ukyo took Ranma's other arm. "Just like old times." She agreed with a matching grin.</p><p>"W-wait." Gengi Chiba said, almost shouting. "You're really Usagi?" He asked. He licked his lips when Ranma nodded. "You're Ranma Saotome, aren't you?" Ranma grinned widely and nodded. "Heard about you." He said. "I was wondering," He said hesitantly.</p><p>"Why Mr. Chiba." Ranma laughed. "Are you making a pass at me?" He looked at Akane and Ukyo. "You mind?" He asked.</p><p>"You are such a slut Ranma." Akane giggled. "Oh go ahead." She and Ukyo released Ranma's arms. Ranma strolled over to Gengi with a strippers strut. As he neared Gengi could see that while Ranma was male he was wearing eyeshadow and mascara.</p><p>"I'm afraid you're going to have to settle for a kiss, Gengi." Ranma said with a sultry smile. "Pucker up."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Captain Osigi opened the door of the main cabin. The room was lit only by a single dim light. "Milord?" The captain looked around. He spotted Tatewaki sitting cross-legged on the floor. His sword lay on the floor next to 's eyes were closed and his breathing was deep and even. "Milord."<p>Tatewaki opened his eyes slowly. "You found them." Tatewaki stated in a rumble.</p><p>"Yes Milord." Captain Osigi reported. "Six ships. Two cargo and four fighters." The captain said. "They're anchored in a nearby natural harbor."</p><p>"What time is it?" He asked.</p><p>"Just before noon Milord." The captain replied.</p><p>Tatewaki picked up his sword and stood. "Then it's time." He said. "Give the word." He ordered.</p><p>"At once Milord." Captain Osigi said with barely concealed anticipation. He saluted Tatewaki, turned smartly on his heels and strode away.</p><p>Tatewaki turned to look out the window of the cabin. "I hope you are safe sister." Tatewaki said quietly. "I fear I may be busy for a time." Tatewaki felt the yacht's engines throttle up through the soles of his feet. Tatewaki smiled.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The morning found Kodachi, Noriko and a smug looking Kinnikun Honda enjoying a late breakfast. The suite had a secluded breakfast nook and they were taking full advantage of it. Yuki watched attentively from her station near the door. She watched as Kodachi laughed and flirted with the Yakusa lord. 'Noriko was right.' She thought in half grudging admission. Yuki walked over with a tea pot and poured more tea for Kodachi and Kinnikun and then hurried back to get coffee for Noriko.<p>The door behind Yuki opened and Yoshi walked in carrying several newspapers. He had a bemused expression on his face. "The papers My Lady." Yoshi announced. "I think you might find the headlines of interest." He added.</p><p>Kodachi raised an eyebrow. "Noriko please see what Yoshi is talking about."</p><p>"Of course Ms Kuno." Noriko replied. She held out her hand and Yoshi handed her one of the newspapers. Noriko unfolded it. A moment later she began to chuckle. "Well, well, well." She said. "It appears that the Terrible Three were busy last night."</p><p>"Terrible three?" Inquired Kinnikun.</p><p>"Three of the Ice Queen's most effective enforcers." Noriko explained. "Nakamura was captured last night." She said to Kodachi.</p><p>"That is good news." Kodachi said in satisfaction. Suddenly Kodachi frowned and she turned to Kinnikun. "Oh dear, I guess there goes the reason for an alliance." She said regretfully.</p><p>"On the contrary, my dear Kodachi." Kinnikun replied. "If anything the very effectiveness of the Ice Queen's people just make an alliance that much more important."</p><p>"Well the Terrible Three are effective." Kodachi agreed.</p><p>"I wasn't speaking of the Terrible Three." Kinnikun smiled. "Not completely." He said. "No I was referring to the two lovely women who so kindly invited me spend some time with them." He bowed slightly from his seat. "Last night was an evening I'll long remember."</p><p>"It was an evening I'll long remember as well Kinnikun." Kodachi replied huskily. "You will visit us when you come to Tokyo?" Kodachi added in warm tones.</p><p>"I will be counting the days." Kinnikun avowed. "I hope you'll allow me to see you off."</p><p>"Well our flight isn't for another three hours." Kodachi replied.</p><p>Noriko turned in her seat and made a shooing motion with her hands at Yuki and Yoshi. The two retainers nodded, bowed and left. She stood and walked over to Kinnikun and pulled him to his feet. "We've got a couple hours to kill before we need to leave." She purred. "Why don't we see if we can have a morning we will remember for a long time as well."</p><p>"Noriko." Kodachi scolded in amusement. "She is incorrigable." She said to Kinnikun. She stood and took Kinnikun's arm. "But I must admit she does have some good ideas." Noriko took his free arm. "It's one of the things I like about her."</p><p>"Indeed." Kinnikun replied in tones of amusement. He looked at Noriko fondly. "Good ideas. The hallmark of a good lieutenant."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Dong Chi Ming, the Captain of the pirate fleet lowered his binoculars. "It looks like a private yacht." He said to the man standing next to him on the bridge. He raised his binoculars again. He snorted. "Yeah, bunch of rich shits." He laughed. "Brought their women along I see." He said. "Nice tits on them." He lowered the binoculars again. "Let's see if we can take them alive." He turned to the man next to him. "Give the order Fai Low."<p>Tatewaki walked into the bridge. "Is everything in readiness, Captain?" Tatewaki rumbled.</p><p>"Yes Milord." Captain Osigi reported crisply. He smiled coldly. "And it appears they've taken the bait."</p><p>Tatewaki's smile matched his Captain's. "Excellent." Tatewaki replied. "Well don't let me keep you from your fun."</p><p>Captain Osigi's smile was now so wide it seemed impossible that it could widen anymore with hurting him. "Thank you Milord."</p><p>Tatewaki waved a hand and left the cabin. As he strode along the decks he saw the two women who volunteered to act as bait putting sunscreen on their bare breasts. On the deck next to them was their clothes and their weapons.</p><p>Tatewaki continued along the swaying deck until he reached the stern of the boat. Waiting patiently was a familiar figure. "Ah Sasuki my old friend." Greeted Tatewaki. "How are you this fine morning?"</p><p>"Well Master." The diminutive ninja replied. Sasuki glanced at the inflatable rubber craft on the deck next to him. "Master?" He said hesitantly. "Are you sure this is wise?"</p><p>"Wise?" Tatewaki rumbled in reply. "Probably not." He admitted. "But somehow appropriate." He too looked at the small rubber boat. It had a powerful looking outboard motor and cables ran from the small boat to a winch. Tatewaki walked over to the winch and soon the craft was rising off the deck. Between the efforts of Tatewaki and Sasuki they soon had the craft lowered to the water. Sasuki jumped over the rail and landed lightly in the boat. Tatewaki waited until his servant had the motor lowered into the water before he swung down one of the cables and into the boat as well. Tatewaki unhooked the cables as Sasuki started the engine.</p><p>"Ready master." Sasuki announced.</p><p>Tatewaki drew his katana and held it over his head. "In that case, once more into the breach."</p><p>"Banzai." Shouted Sasuki and aimed the small craft toward the approaching pirate craft.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Dong Chi Ming looked on in disbelief as a motorized rubber dinghy raced toward him. A madman with a sword stood in the front of the small craft. "What the hell?"<p>"Captain." One of the pirates ran up. "More ships are coming into the harbor." The pirate pointed. Three more yachts had entered the mouth of the harbor and were racing toward them.</p><p>"Fuck." Dong Chi Ming exclaimed angrily. "What are those idiots playing at?" He growled. "Well if they want to play." He smiled nastily. "Give the order; fire at will." He said. "I want those ships burning."</p><p>"Yes Captain." The pirate ran off.</p><p>"And someone shoot that madman in the rubber boat." He yelled after the crewman. An explosion shattered the air and a geyser of water erupted just off the bow. The captain spun around. From where he stood he could see a flurry of activity coming from the first yacht. "Cannon?" He stared for a moment. "It's a trap." He yelled.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki smiled grimly as Sasuki wove the small craft in a zig zag pattern toward the pirate ship. He saw a pirate raise a weapon, there was the sound of automatic fire. Tatewaki's sword wove a pattern in front of him forming a shield against the bullets.<p>The rubber craft reached the side of the ship and Tatewaki leaped into the air and on to the deck of the pirate craft. Sasuki was a step behind.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Captain Osigi had a smile on his face as he led his flotilla into battle against the pirates. His crew efficiently manned their posts. He calmly shouted orders which were obeyed with the speed and control that came after hours upon hours of practice.<p>Tatewaki had spent a lot of money refitting the captured yachts. Cannon rose smoothly out of their hidden housings and he barely suppressed a laugh as one of the cannon was operated by the two topless women. ""Give them hell girls." He shouted from his bridge. "Gods but this is the life." He said cheefully.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki looked up from her desk as the door opened. Into her office strode Kodachi and just behind her Noriko Mata. The two women walked to the desk and bowed. Nabiki sat back in her chair and examined Kodachi closely. The gymnast was wearing her veil and dressed in black but there was something different about Kodachi. "Welcome back." Nabiki said pleasantly.<p>"Thank you Lady Kuno." Kodachi said in reply.</p><p>Nabiki waved to the seats in front of the desk and the two women sat. "I see congratulations are in order." Nabiki said once the two women were seated. "Well done Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Thank you Lady Kuno." Kodachi repeated. "Though I feel Noriko deserves much of the credit."</p><p>"Does she?" Nabiki gave Kodachi's companion an approving look. Before she could say anything more the door opened again and Kimi walked in. "Kimi?"</p><p>"I just heard from Tatewaki." Kimi smiled broadly.</p><p>"Good news?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Excellent news." Kimi replied. "Hey Kodachi, good to see you." Kimi said in greeting. "You too Noriko."</p><p>"It's good to see you as well Lady Ota." Kodachi replied. Noriko nodded in agreement. "My brother is well?"</p><p>"Well he certainly sounded cheerful." Kimi said with a smile. "He's on his way home." She reported. "Lover boy said to put some champagne on ice." She told Nabiki. Nabiki sat back and blew out a relieved breath. "Worried baby?"</p><p>"A little." Admitted Nabiki. "You know Tatewaki is too brave for his own good."</p><p>"Well he is a Kuno." Kodachi said with a touch of pride in her voice. "We may have our faults, but the Kuno have always been brave."</p><p>"Very brave." Nabiki gave Kodachi an approving look. "Present company included." Nabiki leaned forward. "Oyabun Honda called to congratulate me on having such competant people representing me." She said. Nabiki looked at Noriko. "He included you in his praise."</p><p>Noriko smiled in satisfaction. "That was very sweet of Kinnikun." She said in a tone that matched her expression. "Wasn't it Ms Kuno?"</p><p>Kodachi raised her veil. She was smiling. "Indeed Noriko." She replied "Very sweet." She said. "Maybe you should call him later to thank him personally?"</p><p>"I'll make a note of it Ms Kuno." Noriko replied. "Maybe a conference call?" She suggested. "Maybe we could reminice."</p><p>"Ooh," Kodachi giggled. "Good idea."</p><p>Nabiki and Kimi exchanged raised eyebrowed looks with each other. "The Black Rose is back." Nabiki said so only Kimi could hear. "Be afraid." She said. "Be very afraid."</p><p>Kimi laughed.</p><p>End Book 4</p><p>Author's Notes: Another book done. Don't despair, there is another, shortish piece, on the way. I call it Fallen Angels and it is in response to some requests and I hope you enjoy it. You'll have to wait though, I'm going on vacation, to Hawaii this time, and wont be back for a couple weeks. Later.</p>
