</div><p>Chapter 13</p><p>'Equilibrium'</p><p>Akane and Ukyo eyed each other warily across the kitchen table. Ukyo had been sleeping. Ranma had insisted, in the same bed as Akane and Ranma for over a week now. That was the trouble, they were only sleeping. Ranma would cuddle, even be a little playful with the two of them but that's all she'd do. Or he would do. Ranma even slept the previous evening in his male form. The first few nights had been almost fun but it was starting to become frustrating.</p><p>"Okay." Akane exploded suddenly. "Ask already." She said in complete irritation. "Just ask, so we can get back on with our lives."</p><p>"Oh no Akane." Ukyo shot back in the same irritated tone. "You say it's okay first. All you have to do is say no and you've met Ranma's condition. You want life to get back to normal here you sleep in my room tonight."</p><p>"Leave my room?" Akane said in astonishment. "Never."</p><p>"Then be prepared to spend the next several months being frustrated as hell." Ukyo replied. "Besides, your bed is bigger."</p><p>Akane spluttered in shock. "I can't believe you can be so selfish."</p><p>The door to the apartment opened. Ranma, in male form, was dressed in a pair of black sweats and a hooded sweatshirt. "Hi girls. I'm back." Ranma said cheerfully.</p><p>"Hi Ranma." Akane and Ukyo chorused brightly. "We'll take this up later." Akane hissed out of the side of her mouth. Ukyo nodded and smiled widely for Ranma. Akane did the same.</p><p>"Did you have a nice run?" Akane chirped.</p><p>"Yeah." Ranma stretched. "Man I'm glad we don't have to work every night." He smiled contentedly. "You know, if I knew I could make so much money just taking my clothes off, I would have done it sooner."</p><p>"You know Ranma, I don't think you'll ever develop any feminine modesty." Akane said in slightly sarcastic tones.</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow. "And I suppose I can get feminine lessons from an uncute Tomboy." He said with a small smile.</p><p>"Jerk." Akane said. A smile grew on her face. "Well you could always ask Big Daddy over there." She jerked a thumb at Ukyo. Akane smiled wider as Ukyo sputtered in indignation.</p><p>Ukyo threw her hands up. "Okay, you win." She said in an exasperation. "I do not want a repeat of our first two years together" She looked at Akane. "I'm asking. Just don't make me say it."</p><p>Akane hesitated. 'Ukyo's right, I could just say no.' She looked at Ranma. 'This is a test,' She realized. 'And both solutions can be wrong. No matter what I choose our lives together change.' She looked at Ukyo. 'If I say no, will I be able to trust Ukyo when I really need her.' She looked down. "If I say yes. She said she'd step aside, but, Oh gods this is impossible. Yes or No Akane? Yes or No?' She looked up. Akane moistened her lips nervously. "I'll sleep in the other bedroom tonight."</p><p>"Why you gonna sleep in the other bedroom Tomboy?" Ranma as in a cool voice. It didn't take a genius to figure out what Akane and Ukyo were talking about. It was basically all they'd talked about for several days.</p><p>"You know, " Akane stammered. "So you and Ukyo, you know, can have, um, you know, sex. She asked. I said yes." She said the last defiantly. "Just like you wanted."</p><p>"I understood that, I'm just wondering why you think you're gonna sleep in the other room." Ranma replied with an almost evil smile on his face. "You gotta cover my back ya know."</p><p>Akane sputtered. "You. You want me to watch?" Akane said in horror. "Please just hit me and get it over with. Being hit will be easier than that."</p><p>"That's exactly why I want you there. I trusted you Tomboy." Ranma's blue eyes seemed to glint. Like the sun hitting ice. "I need to know you'll always cover my back. I need to know Ukyo will cover my back. I told you Akane, I'm giving you a chance. This is it. You have to decide if it's worth it." He looked at Ukyo. "You don't seem surprised."</p><p>"I never even considered it until you said it Ran-chan." Ukyo shook her head. "Why did we ever think Ranma was dumb?" Ukyo laughed shakily. "Gods Ran-chan, Akane's right. Getting hit would be easier." She nodded slowly. "Was Nabiki involved somehow?"</p><p>"Actually Kimi." Ranma replied easily. Akane and Ukyo shivered in unison. "And I want to remind everyone that we're the muscle in this outfit. It's Nabs and Kimi that are doing the investigative work. All we gotta do is go where she points us." He said. "We could do that just as well in prison."</p><p>"You'd do that wouldn't you?" It was more of a statement from Akane. "Well at least I'd have you all to myself." Akane sighed. "I only have to watch?" She asked.</p><p>"That's all." Ranma replied. "Cover my back and make sure she's treating me right."</p><p>"And who's to make sure you treat me right Ran-chan?" Ukyo slitted her eyes. "Akane?" She rolled her eyes. "Remind me to do something really nasty to Kimi when this is over." She said to Akane.</p><p>"Don't worry." Akane replied. "I will."</p><p>"Good then tonight I get to sleep with Ukyo." Ranma smiled. "Won't that be nice?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ukyo and Akane eyed each other warily across the bedroom. "This was not my idea." Ukyo grumbled.<p>"Oh like I'm jumping for joy." Akane snarled. "So help me, I have half a mind to do it to her again."</p><p>"I'll hold her down this time sugar." Ukyo growled back. "I don't want you watching me."</p><p>"Shut up Ukyo, I have half a mind to do the same thing to you." Akane snapped back. She snorted. "Nothing in the rules saying I can't."</p><p>"Talking trash again Akane?" Ukyo hissed. The door to the bedroom opened and Ranma walked in.</p><p>"Hi Ran-chan." Ukyo cheerfully. Akane mumbled something under her breath. "Whoa." Ranma, in girl form, was wearing something that was small, black and leather. Her breasts were barely contained by the tiny leather bra. In her hands was a small box. "I didn't know you liked to dress up Ran-chan." She swallowed. "Like that."</p><p>"Me neither." Akane said in a quiet voice.</p><p>Ranma walked over to Ukyo and gave her the box. "I want you to use this." She said with a glance over to Akane.</p><p>Ukyo looked in the box. She nodded as if something was just confirmed. "We're going to see if I can do better. Isn't that right?" She looked at Ranma. "I didn't realize," She said almost to herself. "I'm very sorry Ran-chan. I didn't realize." She looked at Akane. "Thank you for saying yes Akane, but I think I'll go to my room now." Ukyo started to back rapidly out of the room.</p><p>"Oh no you don't Ukyo, I will not let you out-noble me." Akane said. "You put that damn thing on and do what you're supposed to do or so help me."</p><p>"Ranma's mad at me Akane, he's punishing me along with you. I just didn't realize how mad until now." Ukyo gave a quick nervous glance toward Ranma. "I'm really, really sorry Ranma." Ranma nodded in acceptance but otherwise did nothing else.</p><p>"And you say I'm slow?" Akane shot back reclaiming Ukyo's attention. "I figured it out days ago." She said. "So what? It doesn't change a damn thing. You're now in exactly the same position I was earlier. Yes or No Ukyo. Yes or No?" She walked over to Ukyo and jabbed her in the chest. "Now you have to wonder where your relationship is going. Now you have to trust me just like I have to trust you." Akane looked at Ranma. "Now you have to decide if it's worth it."</p><p>Ranma lay down in the bed and crossed her arms over her head. "Let me know what you decide." She said cheerfully. One hand floated from over her head to between her legs. A finger tapped slowly against her leather covered sex.</p><p>"Give me that thing." Ukyo growled.</p><p>"For gods' sake Ukyo, slow down." Akane said sharply as Ukyo quickly removed her clothes then strapped on the dildo. "Can't you see? She's goading you. My temper got me into trouble, remember?" Akane took a deep breath. "Do it right Ukyo. I can't believe I'm saying this. But if you're going to do it, do it right." Akane turned to Ranma. "You're enjoying this, aren't you?" She accused.</p><p>"Yep." Ranma said languidly. "Take your time." Ranma undid the clasp that held her panties in place and slipped it off. "I'll keep myself busy."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Lemon scene #1 deleted. Yes folks there is another one coming.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane and Ukyo eyed each other warily across the main living area. Ukyo broke first. "I can't stand it anymore." She said in exasperation. "It's my fault, okay, I'm sorry."<p>Akane nodded grumpily. "Okay apology accepted." She said. "I'm sorry too."</p><p>"So what are we going to do?" Ukyo asked plaintively. "We either have to figure out how to get along or I'm going to have to agree with Ranma. You two go back to prison and I go back to Uk-chan's."</p><p>"Yuck." Akane said in disgust. "Tell me something Ukyo." Akane said after a pause. "Would you take him still after everything that's happened?"</p><p>"Gods there must be something wrong with me." Ukyo replied. "But yeah I would."</p><p>"Same here." Akane replied. "I'm not happy having to share the jerk. Especially not with you."</p><p>"It's no walk in the park for me either, sugar." Ukyo replied. "What are we going to do?" Ukyo grumbled. "Alternate days?"</p><p>"Somehow I don't think Ranma will agree to that." Akane said glumly. Ukyo nodded wryly in agreement. "It's either become celibate or, " Akane gagged slightly. "Forget that idea." She shook a finger at Ukyo. "Just don't touch me okay?"</p><p>"Me?" Ukyo gasped. "What about you?"</p><p>"Me?" Akane shot back in outrage. "At least I act like a girl most of the time."</p><p>"Yeah, well I notice how you look at my crotch when I play Big Daddy." Ukyo snarled. "Even when you know it's just padding." She stood up. "Wait a minute. I'll be right back." Ukyo ran out of the main room. She returned a few minutes later in her Big Daddy outfit. She had even put on a little makeup to simulate a five o'clock shadow. She walked into the room and posed in front of Akane. "See what I mean. You're already looking." She said in accusation.</p><p>"Well with you shoving it in my face, how could I not?" Akane snapped back. "And speaking of where someone keeps looking. I noticed how you'd stare at me when I danced."</p><p>"I'm supposed to." Ukyo retorted. "I'm supposed to be a guy."</p><p>"You're supposed to be my pimp." Akane replied. "You don't have to stare like you've never seen it before."</p><p>"Well, well." Ukyo sputtered. She stared at Akane. "Oh gods, we have to, we're going to, you and I, oh gods."</p><p>Akane opened her mouth to protest then shut it. "Yes." She said finally. "I think we are."</p><p>Ranma opened the door to the apartment. "I'm back." He called. Ranma shrugged his wide shoulders as no one answered. "They probably went out." He walked over to the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of cold water. "Bath." He decided. Drinking from the bottle he walked into the master bedroom. The bottle fell from his hands.</p><p>Ukyo looked up from between Akane's thighs. She was dressed, at least from the waist up, in her Big Daddy outfit. Her pants were down around her ankles. She had, Ranma also noticed, the dildo strapped between her legs. Ranma reached down and picked up the bottle. "My fiancé." He gasped. "And my best friend." Suddenly Ranma laughed. He walked over to a chair and sat down. "This I gotta see."</p><p>"Ran-chan." Gasped Ukyo. "I, we, didn't expect you back so soon." She made to get up.</p><p>"Oh don't let me stop you." Ranma replied in a cheerful tone. "I wondered how long it would take."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Lemon scene #2<hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Could you both please get off of me." Ukyo said breathlessly. She sighed in relief when Ranma and Akane rolled away. Ukyo rolled over. "Okay." She said. "It's official. We're a bunch of oversexed perverts."</p><p>Ranma and Akane laughed. "Yep." Ranma and Akane chorused. "Gods, I feel like this big weight I didn't know I was carrying was just taken away." Akane continued.</p><p>"Oh yeah." Purred Ukyo. "Okay I admit it, you both turn me on." Akane grunted in agreement. Ukyo looked at Akane. "Don't get a swelled head over it."</p><p>"Think you'll be able to watch each other's backs now?" Ranma asked in an amused tone.</p><p>"Her back, her ass, her legs." Ukyo replied with a giggle.</p><p>"Her mouth." Akane added. She jerked a thumb at Ranma. "His ass."</p><p>"Speaking of ass." Ukyo said. "That was mean, Ran-chan." She rubbed her butt. "I don't think I'll be able to sit for a week."</p><p>"Who you trying to kid Big Daddy?" Akane snickered. "I saw the look on your face. You were loving every minute of it." Akane snickered again. "You really can look like a guy Ukyo. If anyone was watching, other than me that is, they would have thought it was two men." Akane looked at Ranma. He was looking distinctly amused. "Took me long enough to figure it out." She shook a playful finger at Ranma. "I am not wearing a Big Daddy suit."</p><p>Ranma pouted. "I dress up for you." He replied. Ranma scratched the back of his head. "Now can we go stop with the bullshit and concentrate on getting the guys who shot Ukyo?" He asked with more than a touch of annoyance.</p><p>Akane shook her head. "You know just hitting us would have gotten our attention a lot sooner." She mock grumbled. "You'd think almost dying would have taught me something." She looked at Ukyo. "Sorry for being such a jerk."</p><p>"Me too sugar." Ukyo rolled over on her back. She rotated her shoulder a couple times. Ukyo grunted. "I don't hurt anymore."</p><p>"Time to start training again Uk-chan?" Ranma asked in a pleased tone.</p><p>"Oh yeah Ran-chan." Ukyo's face broke into a slow grin. "It's time."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki hung up the phone with a smile. "Hikaru, again?" Kimi asked. "Boy's got expensive tastes." She opened the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of water. "He's the bad guy, Nabs, remember?"<p>"Oh I remember." Nabiki replied. "In fact I'm counting on it." Her smile took on a hard edge. "He's our line into who we really want." Nabiki walked over to Kimi and grabbed the water bottle. She took a sip. "He wants both of us again." She smiled. "He's even sending a limo." She handed the water bottle back to Kimi.</p><p>"That's the third time in the last two weeks." Kimi smiled. "Boy has some serious money to spend."</p><p>"Damn straight." Nabiki replied. "We're not cheap." She handed the bottle back to Kimi. "Lover boy lives too large to be a low level operative. Judging by his muscles and his wallet, I'd say somewhere in the middle; too smart to be just muscle, too flashy to be at the top. High enough to know what we want to know."</p><p>Kimi nodded. "Sounds about right." She gave Nabiki a weighing glance. "I'm glad to see you still have your head screwed on tight."</p><p>"Worried baby?" Nabiki asked seriously. "You shouldn't be. I have you to keep me seeing what's what." Nabiki took the water bottle and sipped at it. "That's what a good partner is supposed to do." Nabiki took another sip and then handed the bottle back to Kimi. "Thanks for caring enough to worry."</p><p>Kimi nodded firmly. "So what does Hikaru want to do?" Kimi asked. "Besides the obvious."</p><p>Nabiki smiled. "We're going to the fights." Nabiki said happily. "A national Kempo tournament no less." Nabiki sighed nostalgically. "You should have seen Ranma fight" She told Kimi. "It was poetry." Nabiki's smile turned predatory. "He wants us to dress to be noticed."</p><p>Kimi tapped her lower lip. "Noticed huh?" A lazy smile came to her face. "I think we should dress to be remembered."</p><p>Nabiki grinned. "Have I told you I like the way you think?" Nabiki walked over to her desk and picked up her purse. "Let's go shopping."</p><p>The limo stopped in front of the arena. Nabiki stepped out. In her short black skirt, Nabiki's nylon covered legs seemed to go on forever. A hint of garter belt just peeked slightly from the hem of the dress. The matching black bustier only emphasized her narrow waist and high breasts. Kimi stepped out wearing a very short, white, frilly skirt and matching high cut camisole. They both wore their long blond wigs and their sunglasses. The two women strode confidently into the arena on high heels.</p><p>"Hikaru said to pick up the seat tickets at the ticket booth." Nabiki said. She looked around and found the window she was looking for. "Good evening." Nabiki said to the man in the ticket booth. "We're guests of Hikaru Nakamura." Nabiki smiled cooly. " Mari and Su."</p><p>The ticket seller looked at a list. His eyebrows rose. "Yes, I see your names are here." He passed two tickets to Nabiki. "An usher will take you to your seats."</p><p>Nabiki took the tickets. She looked at them and smiled happily. "Ooh, front row." They walked to the entrance and showed the tickets to an usher. He led them to the first row and then to a separate, roped off section that had small tables every two chairs for drinks. A metal bucket with a bottle was already placed on the table in front of their seats. "Lover boy is going all out tonight." Nabiki said in appreciation.</p><p>"Speaking of lover boy." Kimi replied. "Where is he?"</p><p>Nabiki looked at her watch and frowned. "He'd better hurry." She said. "The preliminaries will be starting soon." She looked around for a fight card. She waved the usher over and asked for a program. "Pour us a drink Kimi, while I look at this." Nabiki opened the program. Her finger ran quickly through the line up. Suddenly she hissed through her teeth. Nabiki turned and grabbed the glass of champagne that Kimi was about to sip from. Nabiki took a large swallow.</p><p>"What's the matter Nabs?" Kimi asked. Nabiki turned and tapped the section of the program. Kimi's eyes opened wide. "Hikaru?"</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Now this I have got to see." Nabiki sat back in her chair and sipped her champagne. Now that the shock of seeing Hikaru's name on the fight card had passed, she cooly began to assess the situation.</p><p>"You've got that smile Nabs." Kimi teased. "I don't think you can start a betting pool in here."</p><p>"Not without seeing Hikaru in action I can't." Agreed Nabiki. "But consider; Hikaru must be very confident in winning." She smiled. "Not if he expects to enjoy our company afterwards."</p><p>"Fixed? Or a mis-match?" Kimi asked "Lover boy has a big ego."</p><p>"Among other things." Nabiki agreed. "Mis-match then." Nabiki tapped her lower lip. "At least he thinks so."</p><p>The lights in the arena dimmed and a spot light lit the center of the ring. A man ducked under the ropes and walked to the center of the ring. A microphone lowered. "Ladies and Gentlemen." The announcer said. "Welcome to the eighteenth annual Japan Kempo Open. Tonight's card features the winners of all preliminary events in each weight class. Tonight will decide the overall winners."</p><p>Nabiki and Kimi listened with half an ear. Their attentions became focused as the first fighters entered the ring. Hikaru was in the red corner. He was dressed in an insignia-less black silk gi. Both hands and both feet were wrapped in tape. In the blue corner was an extremely powerfully built young man. He was more traditionally clothed in a white gi. He too had his hands and feet wrapped. The white gi'ed fighter bounced up and down on his toes.</p><p>Hikaru stood calmly in his corner. He turned to where Nabiki and Kimi were sitting. They waved at him. Hikaru grinned and gave them a wink.</p><p>"Come on lover." Kimi yelled. "Kick his ass." She turned to Nabiki. "Hey just getting into the spirit of the whole thing." She said in an aside.</p><p>Nabiki grinned. She turned to the ring. "Hey baby." She called. "Better make this fast or we may go home without you."</p><p>Hikaru laughed. "If it were anyone else I wouldn't take that threat seriously." Hikaru called back. "Don't worry baby, I'll make it quick." Nabiki raised her champagne glass in a salute. She and Kimi sat down.</p><p>The referee signaled the two fighters to the center of the ring. They bowed to each other, though Hikaru's bow bordered on being insultingly shallow. Hikaru and the other fighter got into their respective stances.</p><p>"Begin." Barked the referee.</p><p>Thirty seconds after the fight started, Nabiki found herself back on her feet screaming Hikaru on. The fighters seemed evenly matched but to Nabiki's practiced eye she could tell that Hikaru was holding back. Even so, the skill being displayed was amazing and got the house roaring. The round was nearly over when the white gi'd fighter got a spinning kick through Hikaru's guard, sending him to the ground. The point was awarded to the blue corner.</p><p>Hikaru picked himself up. His lips were curled into a snarl of anger. When the referee signaled for the next round to begin, Hikaru attacked. It wasn't a charge. It was an assault. Suddenly Hikaru's hands began to strike faster and faster. The white gi'd fighter found himself blocking ever more frantically. The blow that finally got through lifted the white gi'd fighter into the air and sent him sailing back to the edge of the ring. The man got to his knees and shook his head. Then he pounded his fists against the matt and got a little slowly to his feet.</p><p>Nabiki fought to keep the shock off her face. 'Shit. That was almost a 'Chestnut Fist'.' Nabiki took a sip from her glass. She took a closer look at Hikaru. After years of living in a dojo and two years of living with or meeting an extraordinary number of chi adepts, Nabiki was familiar with the signs.</p><p>The two fighters lined up again. Nabiki focused on Hikaru. Under the bright lights, she could just make out the slight roiling in the air that would surround someone as they gathered their chi. Nabiki swallowed.</p><p>'I have to let Ranma know.' She thought. Her estimate of Hikaru changed. 'Not a mid level drug dealer.' Nabiki suddenly realized as another thought came to her mind. She took another sip of her champagne to cover her expression. "No not a mid level drug dealer at all.'</p><p>The referee waved the fight on. Hikaru stepped forward so quickly he seemed to blur. The palm strike that took his opponent out was delivered so fast and Hikaru regained his stance so quickly that it almost seemed as if Hikaru hadn't even moved. The man in white fell to the ground. The entire auditorium hushed in astonishment before it erupted into deafening cheers. Hikaru raised his hands in aggressive triumph then ran to the edge of the ring.</p><p>"That fast enough for you baby?" He called to Nabiki.</p><p>Nabiki raised her glass to Hikaru. "Not bad lover." She called back. "Now you just remember to take your time later."</p><p>Hikaru grinned back behind his mouth protector. He pounded his chest with one fist then raised that fist into the air. The crowd screamed its approval.</p><p>"Can Ranko beat him?" Kimi asked quietly.</p><p>"Ranma can." Nabiki replied in a sure tone. "Akane or Ukyo? Maybe." Nabiki turned to Kimi. "Lover boy's talents extend beyond his wallet or the bedroom. Girlfriend, what you are looking at so hungrily, can best be described as Ranma; without the curse."</p><p>"That good?" Kimi's raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Oh it get's better." Nabiki replied. "I recognized the techniques." She nodded toward the ring. "Lover has a Joketsuzoku teacher." She smiled wryly at Kimi. "That's a Chinese Amazon." She said. "Remember the third fiancé I told you about? Shampoo could give Ranma a run for his money. Her teacher," Nabiki gave a low whistle. "Now that was one crafty old broad. I'll tell you about her later. Just put this in your head. Tough, well trained, secretive and deadly."</p><p>"Got it." Kimi replied. "Lover boy has one of these Joker-Said-So girls for a teacher. That shouldn't be possible, right?"</p><p>"That's what I like about you girlfriend." Nabiki said. "You're quick." Nabiki nodded. "Got it in one. " She smiled broadly. "Smile, don't look so serious." She said quietly. Kimi smiled brightly. "Joketsuzoku wouldn't train an outsider unless they wanted him for something. Now it could just be for him to get at least one of their warriors pregnant." Nabiki nodded. "That was basically what they wanted Ranma for."</p><p>"Poor stud." Kimi said sympathetically. "No wonder she's all fucked up."</p><p>"Yeah." Agreed Nabiki. "We'll talk more later." Nabiki waved. "Here comes lover boy."</p><p>Hikaru swept up to the seats. He was dressed in a light gray silk suit. "I see you ladies decided to stay." He said cockily.</p><p>Nabiki smiled broadly. She took Hikaru's arm. "Almost missed us lover. We were about to go anyway."</p><p>Kimi took Hikaru's other arm. "Are your fights always this fast?" Kimi asked."Why you hardly broke a sweat. It's not a workout if you don't. Sweat."</p><p>"Sweating will have to wait baby." Hikaru said. He sat down. Nabiki and Kimi sat on either side. Nabiki poured Hikaru a glass of champagne and handed it to him. Hikaru took it without comment. "I have some business to attend to first."</p><p>"Business?" Asked Nabiki. "Should we leave?' She asked brightly. "Or help?"</p><p>Hikaru smiled at Nabiki. "That's what I like about you Mari." He said. "You're quick." He grunted. "Help. Keep them smiling."</p><p>Kimi and Nabiki exchanged a look. Nabiki nodded almost imperceptibly. "It'll be extra." Kimi said. "Depending on how much smiling you want done."</p><p>"You just keep the old man entertained." Hikaru directed Kimi. "It's the son that I need to keep happy."</p><p>"I think we can handle that." Nabiki raised a hand to call over a waiter. "Sake or wine?" She asked Hikaru. "For the old man." She clarified.</p><p>"He's real traditional." Hikaru replied. Hikaru smiled in appreciation.</p><p>"Sake." Nabiki told the waiter. "And a large sushi platter. Heavy on the sea urchin roe." She looked at Hikaru. "Beer for the son?" Hikaru nodded. "Two bottles of Kirin and water for everyone."</p><p>"Here they come." Said Hikaru. He stood as two men approached. The 'old-man' was a chubby almost cherubic looking man in his late seventies. The son was a vigorous man in his fifties, though his heavily muscled frame had already started to turn to fat. He had a face that was puffy from too much drinking. Hikaru bowed to the old man. "Mr. Satoh." He said. "Thank you for coming." He looked at the other man. "Kenichi."</p><p>"Hikaru." The man replied. He looked around and spotted Kimi and Nabiki. "Who are they?' He grunted.</p><p>Nabiki slinked over to Kenichi. "We're whoever you want us to be." Nabiki said easily. She raised a hand to be taken.</p><p>Kenichi smiled in appreciation. He took Nabiki's hand in a too warm grip. "Hikaru has good taste." He said.</p><p>"Very expensive taste." Nabiki replied in a sultry voice. She noticed the waiter approaching. "Please sit. I'll pour you a drink."</p><p>"Hey cutie." Kimi said to the senior Satoh. She reached over and pinched the older man's cheek gently. She wrapped an arm around the older man and led him over to one of the chairs. 'Satoh!' She thought in disbelief. She let none of her anger show in her face. Nor none of her glee. She reached over and loosened the old man's tie. "An important man like you should learn to relax." She cooed. The old man smiled happily.</p><p>Nabiki watched as Kimi kept the old man occupied. She kept Kenichi plied with beer while he and Hikaru talked. 'Pretty smart.' She told herself. 'Using the sounds of the fight to cover their conversation.' It was too much for Nabiki to hope that they'd talk about what she wanted to hear and she wasn't disappointed. But what she did hear, even though couched in vague terms, was interesting in its' own right.</p><p>"Look Kenichi." Hikaru was saying. "I think I've proven my worth. All I'm asking for is to be able to do a little more." He smiled. "I'm not asking for a lot."</p><p>"It's not your ability that's the problem Hikaru." Kenichi replied sternly. "It's your age. In a couple years no one will question your right to advancement." Kenji grunted slightly. "But your point is valid. You've been very effective." He shook his head. "No, a promotion is out of the question at the moment." He raised his hand. "But I may have an offer you'll find interesting."</p><p>Hikaru raised his glass and Nabiki refilled it. "Go on." Hikaru leaned back.</p><p>"The Yamamoto's have been pushing into our Eastern territory. It's becoming a problem." Kenichi fixed Hikaru with an appraising stare. "Now if one of our people could turn that around." He smiled a crocodile smile. "Well I don't think age would be a consideration for that person."</p><p>"Would I have a free hand to," Hikaru grinned slightly. "Solve the problem?"</p><p>"Personally I don't care how it's solved." Kenichi replied coldly. "Just as long as it's permanent."</p><p>"Sounds like fun." Hikaru replied. He held his glass out again and Nabiki gracefully refilled it. Hikaru sipped. He nodded. "Deal." He said.</p><p>"Good." Kenichi replied. "I think that's enough business for today." He looked hungrily at Nabiki. "I have a room here." He said. He stood.</p><p>Nabiki arched an eyebrow. "You have expensive tastes." She said in a sultry tone. "But Hikaru did say he wanted you to be happy." She turned to Hikaru. "Isn't that so lover?"</p><p>"Smart girl." Hikaru said in approval. He looked at his watch. "Think you can bring her back in an hour Kenichi?" He said. "We have dinner reservations." Kenichi smiled and tilted his head in acquiescence.</p><p>Kimi watched Nabiki lead the younger Satoh away. 'Watch yourself girlfriend.' She turned back to the elder Satoh. "Ready for some more sushi, cutie?"</p><p>Nabiki amd Kenichi came back almost an hour later to the second. The old man appeared to be sleeping and Kimi was cuddled up next to Hikaru. Kenichi collected his father and the two gangsters walked away.</p><p>"He seemed happy." Hikaru said in an aside.</p><p>"That was what you wanted, I believe." Nabiki replied easily. Inside she was seething but she let none of it show on her face. 'There went any 'Pretty Woman' fantasy I might have had, Kimi was right to worry.' She told herself as she smiled pleasantly. 'You wanted a line in, well you got it.' Nabiki's drank some champagne. 'Satoh.' Nabiki's smile became one of anticipation.</p><p>Hikaru grunted agreement. "Let's blow this joint."</p><p>End Chapter 12</p><p>Author's notes: Two lemon scenes in one chapter? What was I thinking? The first one is actually the only necessary one, the second was mostly for fun. Mostly.</p><p>I received a number of emails, not complaining exactly, just wondering about the missing period of time between getting out of prison and Akane dancing. That story is in the works. It will be Book 2. I felt it deserved to be told as a separate story. Plus it has some spoiler information to Book 1. Anyway, I'm happy everyone seems to be enjoying Queen Rat.</p><p>Oh to the person who wondered if I was writing this from the 'inside'. No. I just have a decent imagination.</p>
