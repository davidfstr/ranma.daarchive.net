</div><p>Chapter 10</p><p>'Cold War'</p><p>The limo stopped at a corner in downtown Nerima and three girls, two teens and an adolescent, exited from the back. A tall, slim man in a severely cut suit exited from the front passenger seat. With the man walking several paces behind, the three girls walked down the busy streets and window shopped.</p><p>"I can't believe I'm saying this, but gods I'm glad to get away from the mansion." Kagomi said in relief. Since that first time she had babysat, Kagomi had been invited to the mansion nearly every weekend. The reason for Kagomi's statement was that as part of her staying at the mansion, along with Pema and Kiko, she was required to take deportment and etiquette lessons from the formidable Madame Demille. Not that any of the three actually disliked the deportment teacher, in fact they all liked her, but the lessons were something else.</p><p>"Me too." Chimed Kiko. "Boring."</p><p>"You two." Pema said in scolding tones. "You not know how good you have it." She reminded them. "Pema think lessons fun."</p><p>"You would." Kagomi rolled her eyes. "I agree with the shrimp; boring." She said. Kagomi stopped in front of a window. "Ooh, those are cute." She said. Pema and Kiko pressed their faces against the window.</p><p>For the next couple of hours the three girls enjoyed their free afternoon. All the while the slim man trailed unobtrusively behind. As had been remarked upon before, Yoshi may have considered what he was doing babysitting but he did not take his duties lightly. Especially now that Kiko was now, for all intents and purposes, the adopted daughter of Kodachi Kuno. In fact, Yoshi was part of a growing number of Kodachi's personal retainers who believed Kiko should be living full time at the mansion.</p><p>Yoshi frowned and touched his ear bud. "Bring the limo." He ordered. "They've been recognized."</p><p>Pema turned as a number of girls around her age came up to her. "You're Pema, aren't you?" One girl said. Kagomi giggled. "Sound familiar?" She said to Pema. Pema smiled in remembrance. She nodded. "Yes, I Pema." She said. The girl thrust out a book. "Can I have your autograph?" The girl exclaimed. "You want Pema autograph?" Pema asked in surprise. The girl nodded frantically.</p><p>"Face it Pema, you're famous." Kagomi said as Pema signed the book and another was thrust in her face. "You're the girl who lives with the Terrible Three, remember?" She said. "I'm surprised they're not asking for Kiko's autograph too."</p><p>"Omigod." One of the girls screamed. "It's Kiko Kuno." She said in sudden recognition. Kiko suddenly found herself on the receiving end of the autograph hunters.</p><p>"Me and my big mouth." Kagomi muttered. She looked up as Yoshi approached. "Time to go?" She guessed. Yoshi nodded. "Darn." She grumbled. Kagomi sighed. "Well, it was fun while it lasted." She said. "Come on guys." She said to Pema and Kiko. Kagomi took Pema and Kiko's hands and dragged them away from the autograph seekers. Only Yoshi's scowling presence kept the teenaged fans from following. Soon the three girls were back in the limo and driving away.</p><p>The limo was just approaching the gates of the Kuno mansion when another car rammed into its' side. A second car screeched around the corner, stopped, and disgorged a number of men in dark suits. These men had guns and the air was suddenly filled with the sound of gun fire and the smell of gun powder. Bullets panged harmlessly off the armored sides and bulletproof glass of the limo. Pema instinctively threw herself protectively over Kiko and pulled Kagomi down with her.</p><p>The driver of the limo gunned the engine and the limo shot away leaving the attackers far behind. The mansion gates swung open and the limo raced toward the mansion even as angry retainers could be seen pouring from the mansion itself. Pema kept her arms around both Kiko and Kagomi even as the car stopped. The rear door opened.</p><p>"Everyone okay?" Yoshi asked in concern.</p><p>"I'm okay." Kiko said from beneath Pema. "Pema?"</p><p>"I fine." Pema replied. "Kagomi?" There was silence. "Kagomi?" Pema repeated in concern. "Kagomi!"</p><p>"Let me see her." Yoshi ordered. The retainer quickly turned the Japanese girl over. His hand pressed against her neck, then he lifted a closed eyelid. "She's alive but unconscious." He said. He turned as several retainers approached the car. "Get a stretcher. The girl may have a concussion." He said warningly as hands reached for the teen. He put a comforting arm around Pema and led the Tibetan girl away from the car. Pema kept looking back.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Kodachi knocked softly on the door to the bedroom before opening the door and entering. Pema was sitting on the bed and didn't look up even when Kodachi sat down next to her. "I just spoke to the doctor." Kodachi said in gentle tones. "She's going to be fine." Pema nodded without looking up. Kodachi looked at the Tibetan girl. "It wasn't your fault." She said softly.</p><p>"But..." Began Pema.</p><p>"It wasn't your fault." Kodachi repeated firmly.</p><p>"Listen to Kodachi." A familiar voice said from the doorway. "She's telling the truth."</p><p>"Ranma!" Pema exclaimed tearfully. Pema leaped from the bed and threw herself into Ranma's strong arms. Pema started sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p>"Shh." Ranma said soothingly. "I'm here, baby." He said. Pema felt herself being wrapped in several additional pairs of arms. "We're all here." Ranma looked over Pema's head and at Kodachi. Kodachi nodded and left the bedroom. "It's okay, punkin." Ranma said softly. "You're safe."</p><p>Pema looked up at Ranma with tears running down her face. "Th-they hurt Kagomi." She said in a whimper. Pema freed a hand and wiped angrily at her eyes. "An-and Pema d-did nothing." She said in self reproach. "Pema j-just let th-them..."</p><p>"Now you stop that right now, Pema." Akane said sharply. "There was nothing you could have done." Akane said.</p><p>"That's our job." Ukyo added. "Don't worry baby." Ukyo said. "We'll find out who did this." She said. "And when we do..."</p><p>"You make them pay." Pema interrupted angrily. "You promise Pema. You make them pay."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema opened the door slowly. The room, one of many in the mansion, had been converted into an infirmary. Lying on the single bed in the room was Kagomi. "You awake?" Pema asked quietly.</p><p>"Hey Pema." Kagomi called in greeting. She smiled when Pema hurried over to the bed and started fluffing the pillows and straightening the blanket. "I'm okay, Pema, really." She said. "I just bumped my head." Kagomi patted the bed. "Now how about sitting down and telling me what's been going on." She said. "No one tells me anything." She complained.</p><p>"Kagomi sure she okay?" Pema asked in concern. "You asleep for two day." She said. "Pema so scared Kagomi never wake up."</p><p>"I'm fine, Pema." Kagomi said. "And bored." She complained. "I'm so bored I'd even be happy to see Madame Demille." She said with a smile.</p><p>"Now Pema really worried." Pema replied. The two teens looked at each other for a long moment then they simultaneously broke into giggles. "Oh Pema so happy Kagomi alright." She sat on the edge of the bed. "Kagomi grandpa call. Pema tell grandpa what happen. Ooh, grandpa use bad, bad word when Pema tell." Kagomi giggled along with Pema. "Ranma still not find bad mens who hurt Kagomi." Pema said. "But Ranma say he not stop looking." Pema said in satisfied tones. "Kagomi not worry, Ranma punish bad mens when Ranma find."</p><p>"Ranma doesn't have..." Began Kagomi.</p><p>"Ranma do, because Pema ask." Pema interrupted. "And Pema ask because no one hurt Pema bestest friend." She declared. "That promise." Pema lay down next to Kagomi. "Pema need Kagomi get better real quick." She said. "Pema miss cuddling with Kagomi." She said softly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"This is JNN." The middle aged reporter intoned. "Our top story; what can only be described as a 'Reign of Terror' has engulfed Japan's underworld." The reporter announced. "Pimps, dealers, small gangs and large, from Tokyo to Hokkaido, none seem immune." The reporter said. Images appeared on the screen behind him. Warehouses in flames, cars smashed, bars with their windows shattered and doors hanging off their hinges. Image after image. "So far there has been no loss of life and the injuries have been minimal but for how long?" The reporter asked. "Who's behind it? And why?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Nabiki Tendo composed her face into it's Ice Queen immobility. "Bring them in Kimi." She said in controlled and cold tones. Kimi nodded and walked to the office door. She opened it. "The Ice Queen will see you now." Kimi said in her own cold tones. A half dozen men strode angrily into the office. One even was bold enough to advance menacingly on Nabiki.</p><p>"I would suggest you stop." A calm, masculine voice said from the wet bar. There was the ringing sound of metal on metal as a sword appeared in the man's hand. Tatewaki Kuno strode from the bar and stood in front of the angry group of men with his sword held steady in his hands. "The next person to even take a single step forward will regret it." He said. "Only not for very long." His voice dripped menace.</p><p>"I thought we had an agreement." The apparent leader spat. "We leave you alone and you leave us alone." He said.</p><p>"Yes, we did." Nabiki replied. "And someone has broken it." Nabiki leaned back in her chair and gazed at the men calmly. These men were Yakusa lords in their own right. Though not associated with Nabiki's organization in any way. Nabiki had been careful not to encroach on their territories or activities. Nabiki's own territory and influence was great and continued to grow but there were limits. Nabiki was patient and she knew that, in time, she would be able to bring many of them over to her way of thinking but not now and not yet. "An associate of mine has been...insulted." She said. "Someone, possibly someone in this room, has broken the truce."</p><p>"Who?" Demanded the apparent leader.</p><p>"Unknown." Nabiki said simply. "And until I know who has perpetrated this insult..." Nabiki gave the barest of shrugs. "There is little I can do." She leaned forward and smiled coldly. "In fact, there is little I wish to do." She said.</p><p>"It'll mean war." The Yakusa threatened.</p><p>"If that's what you wish." Nabiki replied in icy tones. Nabiki smiled. It was a cold smile devoid of any humor. "Possibly you may even win." She said. "It's a faint possibility but a possibility none the less." Nabiki folded her hands on her desk and gazed calmly at the angry Yakusa lords. "Or...you can find out who started this and end it." She said. "Your choice."</p><p>The Yakusa lords looked at each other for a moment. There were several faint nods. The Yakusa lord who had been speaking turned back to Nabiki. "We need time." He said.</p><p>"You have a week." Nabiki said cooly.</p><p>"Impossible." The Yakusa lord exclaimed.</p><p>"A week." Repeated Nabiki. "And I want them alive."</p><p>"Alive?" Exclaimed the Yakusa lord.</p><p>"Alive." Repeated Nabiki in even colder tones. "I want to hear the confession from their lips myself." Nabiki explained. "Just to be sure."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo stood on the edge of the rooftop and stared out over the city scape. If one had looked they would have seen that the three had nearly the same expressions on their faces. It was a cold look, both figuratively and literally.</p><p>"Where to tonight?" Ukyo asked in a near monotone. After months and months of effort, Ukyo had finally been able to attain the more rarified characteristics of Ranma's modified Soul of Ice. Like Ranma and Akane before her, she found her that the Soul of Ice made her thoughts sharper, her reflexes faster and her emotions nearly non-existant. Unlike Akane, who still suffered some degree of pain upon exiting the Soul of Ice, Ukyo was able to make the transition smoothly and easily. On the other hand, Akane was still the only one of the three who could produce her own private cold front and cause a storm. Regardless it was very, very cold where the three of them stood.</p><p>"Docks?" Suggested Akane. "There's usually something happening there." She pointed out. Like Ukyo, her voice was a near monotone. Akane suddenly pointed. "Heads up." She said. "Company." A lone figure bounced along the rooftops and in their general direction. "Well, well." Akane said in recognition. "look who's back in town." The figure changed direction slightly and headed directly for them. A minute later the figure landed on the rooftop. The arrival was a woman with long purple hair that she wore in two long braids. She had vanbraces covering her arms and what looked like metal shoulder pads. She wore a purple midriff baring top. Two long panels of purple fabric covered her bikini covered bottom front and back. Purple furred boots covered her feet. "Hello Shampoo." Akane said cooly.</p><p>Shampoo ignored Akane and walked directly over to Ranma. "Hello Airen." Shampoo chirped.</p><p>"Shampoo." Ranma replied. "I thought you were staying in Sapporo." He said coldly.</p><p>"Was.." Shampoo replied. She rubbed her arms. "It like ice box. You mind we go someplace where it warm?" She grumped. "Shampoo have news." She said.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema eyed the purple haired newcomer with suspicion. "Pema not like way she look at Ranma." Pema whispered to Ukyo. "Pema not trust."</p><p>"Welcome to the club, sugar." Ukyo whispered back. "Her name is Shampoo and she's dangerous." She said. "Now be a good girl and go make tea." Pema nodded and walked into the kitchen.</p><p>"Shampoo see Airen have new girl." Shampoo said with a smirk. "What matter, pervert girl, Airen tired of you already?" She said with a purr.</p><p>"Can it Shampoo." Akane shot back. "You said you have news, so tell us already and go."</p><p>"Now, now is that any way for friends to behave?" Shampoo replied with a sly smile. "You make Shampoo think you not happy to see her."</p><p>"Since when are we friends?" Akane snapped.</p><p>"Quiet, all of you." Ranma snarled. "Why are you here, Shampoo?" He asked curtly. He raised a finger. "And if you call me 'Airen' again, you can just leave."</p><p>"Ranma no fun anymore." Shampoo mock grumped. She smiled as Pema came out of the kitchen carrying a tea service. Pema carried the service to the table, knelt down and poured tea. "Very nice." Shampoo said in approval. "See why you keep, she very pretty." She said. "Maybe you let Shampoo...borrow?" She giggled when Pema nearly jumped up and ran to hide behind Ranma.</p><p>"Hands off, Shampoo." Ranma growled. "I won't warn you a second time." Ranma reached behind him and took one of Pema's hands. "Don't worry, baby, you're safe." He said. "She's just trying to frighten you." He said. "Why don't you sit with the Tomboy?" He suggested. Pema nodded and went over to Akane who immediately pulled her into her lap. Ranma turned back to Shampoo. "Okay, what's the news?"</p><p>Shampoo gave Pema another amused look before answering. "Great grandmother back in Japan." Shampoo reported. "Back in Tokyo." She sipped her tea.</p><p>"Damn." Ranma exclaimed.</p><p>"You don't suppose she's behind...?" Ukyo trailed off. "No, that wouldn't make sense." She corrected herself. Ukyo shook her head. "Great, it's bad enough someone's trying to hurt Pema, now the ghoul is back. Great. Just great."</p><p>"Oh is someone trying to hurt your little...pet?" Shampoo said in silky tones.</p><p>"You're starting to piss me off, bitch." Akane snarled. She tightened her hold on Pema. "If I find out that you're behind it..."</p><p>Shampoo laughed. "Me?" She asked. "If I want dead, she be dead." Shampoo said in cheerful tones. "No worry, pervert girl, it not Shampoo." She sipped her tea. "Not great grandmother either." She added.</p><p>"I'm not so sure about that." Akane said. Akane looked coldly at Shampoo. "The people who attacked the car had guns. The last time there were guns, was when your boyfriend was supplying them." Akane grinned nastily. "Speaking of boyfriends, how is Hikaru?" She asked. "I bet he's real popular."</p><p>Shampoo made a throw away gesture. "Shampoo not really care." She said. "Hikaru fool, deserve what he get." She shrugged. "If it great grandmother, she not tell Shampoo."</p><p>"Would you tell us if she was?" Ranma asked. Shampoo shrugged again. "At least you're honest about it." Ranma said in grudging admission. Ranma rubbed his chin. "The Tomboy's right, the last time there were guns, there was the old ghoul and Jerkamura." He said. "Come to think of it, I'm surprised he's still in prison." He said musingly. "He should have escaped by now."</p><p>"Shampoo take away memories, remember?" Shampoo pointed out.</p><p>"It's not permanent and you know it." Akane replied heatedly. "As I should know."</p><p>"You think he got his memories back and is popping in and out of prison, like we did?" Ukyo asked. Ranma nodded. "Makes sense." Ukyo said in sour tones.</p><p>"Too much sense." Akane said. "Explains the guns and the attacks on baby." Akane squeezed Pema comfortingly. "Don't worry, baby, he'll have to go through us to get you." She said. "And no one gets through us." She declared. Akane's declaration was followed by noises of agreement from both Ranma and Ukyo.</p><p>"Shampoo may not like pervert girl, but Shampoo never thought you stupid." Shampoo said. She sipped her tea for a moment. Shampoo nodded. "Shampoo agree. It most likely Hikaru." She said. "And if true, HIkaru maybe not as big fool as Shampoo think." She said in grudging admission. She grinned. "Maybe Shampoo go visit Hikaru." She said. "Hikaru may not be Ranma, but he oh so close." Shampoo turned her head to look at Pema when the Tibetan girl snorted in derision. "I see your pet not think so."</p><p>"Pema not pet. Pema Ranma's woman." Pema replied hotly from the cradle of Akane's arms. "Pema not know this Hikaru but Pema know Ranma. Ranma best and always be best." She declared. "No one close."</p><p>Shampoo barked a laugh. "Ranma's woman, eh?" She gave Pema a cold look. "Then Shampoo tell little mountain girl truth. Ranma belong to only one woman and Shampoo that woman. You never be more than pet. Plaything."</p><p>Pema stared at Shampoo for a long moment. "Akane, what that bad word you use little while ago?" She asked without taking her eyes off of Shampoo.</p><p>"Bitch?" Akane asked in amusement.</p><p>"Yes, that word." Pema said. "Bitch."</p><p>Shampoo laughed coldly. "Little mountain girl better watch tongue." She warned. "Before Shampoo remove it." She snapped.</p><p>Akane gave Pema a peck on the cheek. "Don't worry, we won't let the purple haired bimbo hurt you." She cooed. "She's just mad that Ranma wants to sleep with you and not her." She told the Tibetan girl. Akane smiled nastily at the Amazon. "Isn't that right, Shampoo?"</p><p>"Stop it." Ranma ordered. "All of you." He pointed a finger at Shampoo. "Who I sleep with is my business, not yours. Got it?" Ranma growled. "Now the girls and I thank you for the information." He said. "And I'm sure the Ice Queen will want to show you her appreciation in a more...tangible manner."</p><p>Shampoo waved a dismissive hand. "Not care about Ice Queen." She said. "Care about Ranma." She looked at Pema. "Oh yes, little mountain girl, Shampoo do care about Ranma." She smiled. "Shampoo even agree with mountain girl, Ranma best, deserve best." Shampoo preened. "And Shampoo best there ever be."</p><p>"Best what?" Akane asked sweetly. "You're a whore just like the rest of us." Akane laughed. "And don't even try to deny it." She said. "I got the pictures to prove it." Akane gave Pema a squeeze. "Get up, baby." Akane said. Pema got off of Akane's lap and sat on floor. Akane stood and hip swayed over to Shampoo. "Now listen up, Shampoo." Akane said. "That 'Ranma is mine' bullshit may have meant something once, but not anymore." She said. "Can it." She said sharply when Shampoo tried to interrupt. "Ranma is his own man. As he said, who he sleeps with is his own business." She laughed again. "Hell, if you tried being nice instead of a bitch, Ranma might even give you a pity fuck." She said.</p><p>"She's gonna have to be pretty damn fucking nice for me to do that." Ranma muttered. He smiled when Pema giggled.</p><p>Akane snorted. "Stranger things have been known to happen, dummy." Akane said. "And if he does, guess what?" She said. "I won't complain." Akane snorted again. "Heck, maybe I'll even join in." She gave Shampoo a leer. "I bet you'd love that."</p><p>Shampoo sipped her tea. "So, pervert girl not even deny she pervert girl." Shampoo said in amusement. "About time." She put the tea cup down. "Shampoo accept."</p><p>"Excuse me." Ukyo said in surprise.</p><p>"Shampoo accept." Shampoo repeated. She gave Akane a wry smile. "It boring in Hokkaido." She said in mild complaint. "No one worth fighting." Her smile became slightly sour. "No one worth fucking, either."</p><p>"Well you ain't fucking Ran-chan." Ukyo returned in annoyed tones. Pema voiced her agreement.</p><p>Shampoo grinned. "Oh no?" She said in amusement. "All Shampoo have do is be nice." She said. "Shampoo can be very, very nice when she want be." She said in a purr. "You see." Shampoo stood. "Well Shampoo go now." She said.</p><p>"Call Nabs." Akane said. "Tell her you're back in town." Shampoo nodded. "And call Kodachi too." Akane added. "She could use someone with your abilities hanging around." Shampoo smiled and nodded."And leave Pema alone." Akane said firmly. Shampoo gave the Tibetan girl an amused look. Shampoo nodded.</p><p>"Thank you for tea." Shampoo said. She gave Pema another amused look and then...she was gone.</p><p>"You don't believe any of that bullshit, do you?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Which bullshit?" Akane replied. She rubbed the back of her neck. "I believe her about the old ghoul." She said. "I even believe her when she said she's bored." She chuckled coldly. "The rest, however, is pure unadulterated bullshit."</p><p>"Pema think bitch going cause trouble." Pema grumbled.</p><p>"Pema probably riight." Ukyo agreed. "I don't know about the rest of you, but I need a cuddle."</p><p>"I think Uk-chan's feeling a little blue, Tomboy." Ranma said.</p><p>"Are you feeling blue, Uk-chan?" Akane asked in concern.</p><p>Ukyo blew out a breath. "Not blue, really." Ukyo replied. "Just a little...inadequate." She said. "Everytime Shampoo..."</p><p>"Ah." Akane said knowingly. "You don't have the blues, you have the purples." Akane nodded. "Fortunately there is a cure for the purples."</p><p>Ukyo smiled lopsidedly. "Yeah?" She asked. "And what's the cure?"</p><p>"Yes, what cure?" Pema asked. "Because Pema think she have purples too."</p><p>Akane laughed. "Now we can't have our two favorite girls have the purples, now can we Ranma?" Akane said in a teasing tone.</p><p>"Nope." Agreed Ranma. "I dunno Tomboy, I don't think I can get both of em out of the purples all by myself, I think I'm gonna need help." He and Akane exchanged grins. "Tell you what, I'll start the...cure." He said. "Why you..."</p><p>"Change...into something more appropriate?" Akane said in an off hand manner.</p><p>"Exactly." Ranma agreed. Ranma walked over to Ukyo and put his arm around her waist. "Come here Pema." Ranma said. Pema hurried over and Ranma put his free arm around the Tibetan girl's waist. He started guiding them toward the bedroom, while Akane skipped off in the opposite direction. Ranma led Pema and Ukyo into the bedroom. With some purposefully unhelpful help, Ranma eventually succeeded in getting himself and the by now giggling Ukyo and Pema undressed.</p><p>Pema licked her lips. "Does Ranma want Pema to...?"</p><p>"Hold that thought, punkin." Ranma said. He walked to the door of the bedroom. He opened the door a crack. "Ready?" He asked quietly. If there was a response neither Ukyo nor Pema heard. Ranma opened the door wider. "Tah Dah!" Ranma sang. Into the room strode a tall and powerfully built man dressed in only a towel wrapped around his waist.</p><p>Pema stared wide-eyed at the man. Suddenly she broke into giggles. "Akane?" The now male Akane nodded and pulled the towel off. "Surprise." He said.</p><p>"I can feel the purples leaving already." Ukyo said with a chuckle. "Pema honey, I hope you're really, really hungry." She said in an aside to the Tibetan girl.</p><p>"Pema very hungry." Pema said huskily. She looked back and forth between the naked forms of Ranma and Akane. She licked her lips. "Pema very, very hungry."</p><p>The male Akane seemed to undulate toward Pema. He cupped Pema's chin and leaned closer. Akane kissed the Tibetan teen hungrily. Pema responded just as hungrily. Akane broke the kiss and scooped Pema up in his arms. Akane carried Pema to the bed. A surprised squeal let Pema know that Ranma had copied Akane's actions and was carrying Ukyo to the bed.</p><p>"Hey Baby." Akane said in his husky male voice. "You don't mind if we let Ranma take care of Uk-chan first, do you?"</p><p>"Oh no, Akane." Pema replied. "Uk-chan have bad case of purples." She said with a slight giggle. "Pema want to see if cure work." Pema rolled around with her back pressed against Akane's front. "Maybe Ranma need help." She chirped. Akane laughed. Pema wiggled against Akane. "Ooh, that must feel good." Pema said. "Pema never see Uk-chan smile so big." Akane laughed at Pema's words. Pema wiggled again. Pema giggled. "Akane?"</p><p>"Yeah, baby?" Akane husked in a deep baritone.</p><p>"Pema think Akane need womans." Pema said.</p><p>"Akane thinks Pema is right." Akane replied. "I wonder what I should do about that?" Pema turned in Akane's arms. "Oh I know." Akane said. Akane captured Pema's mouth with his own.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Lemon section removed email me, email not PM, if you want it.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema woke up several hours later in a tangle of arms and legs, her head was comfortably pillowed on Ranma's chest. She could feel a warm and obviously male body pressed against her back. 'If this Ranma, that must be Akane.' She thought. She opened her eyes to see Ukyo asleep and sharing Ranma's chest. "I'm Ranma's woman." She thought happily. Pema giggled quietly. "And Akane's." She thought. "just like Ukyo." Pema sighed happily and went back to sleep.</p><p>Author's Notes: Coming to the end of Book 7, couple more chapters. I'm also almost done with the wedding scene. More of a sidestory. Anyway, like I said, almost done.</p>
