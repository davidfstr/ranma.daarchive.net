</div><p>Queen Rat</p><p>Book 7</p><p>The Saatchi Kato Interviews</p><p>'Ice Queen'</p><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight, I'm your host, Saatchi Kato." The pretty reporter said. "We have a special, very special, show tonight." The reporter said in barely suppressed excitement. The reporter took a deep breath to calm herself. She composed her features and faced the camera. She opened her mouth, closed it, opened it again. "I'm going to be interviewing the Ice Queen." She suddenly squealed. "Nabiki Tendo has graciously offered Japan Tonight an exclusive interview." She was almost panting by the time she finished the sentence. She pulled herself together. "When we come back."</p><p>The reporter stood as the commercial began and walked over to a separate section of the studio. Two chairs, each with its' own end table, centered the stage. She sat down in one chair and clipped on her clipped on her microphone while an assistant adjusted her makeup. "Is she ready?" She hissed to her assistant. The woman nodded.</p><p>"Ten seconds." Called the program director. "And in five, four." His hand came up and showed three fingers, two fingers. He pointed to Saatchi Kato.</p><p>"Welcome back." The reporter said to the camera. "Beautiful, wealthy, intelligent." She enumerated. "These words, and more, have been used to describe my guest." The reporter began. "Yet much remains a mystery. We hope, tonight, to dispel some of the mystery that surrounds her." The reporter stood and waved a hand. "Nabiki Tendo, The Ice Queen." The small studio audience erupted in applause.</p><p>From the wing of the studio, Nabiki Tendo walked on stage. She wore an obviously custom made and just as obviously expensive black busines suit that enhanced rather than disguised her figure. Her hair was in its' familiar helmet cut. A gold and jade necklace adorned her neck. Nabiki walked over to the reporter who bowed deeply. Nabiki returned the bow and the two women sat. "Ms. Tendo, thank you so much for coming here tonight."</p><p>"Call me Nabiki." Nabiki replied. "It's my pleasure, I've long been a fan of your show."</p><p>"Thank you." The reporter paused. "Nabiki." She smiled. "You were born the second of three daughters, to a well respected martial artist." The reporter began. Nabiki nodded. "Your mother died when you were six, I believe."</p><p>"Seven." Nabiki corrected. "My baby sister, Akane, was six."</p><p>"Ah yes, please excuse me." The reporter said contritely. "That must have been difficult, growing up without a mother."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "I think Daddy and Akane suffered the most." Nabiki said. "But, yes, it was difficult." Nabiki reached over to the small table and picked up a glass and took a sip. "Sometimes very difficult, but we survived." Nabiki added. She placed the glass back on the table.</p><p>The reporter nodded sympathetically. "You attended Furinken High School. It was at Furinken that you picked up the nickname, the Ice Queen. Could you tell us how that came about"</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "It was an insult."</p><p>"An insult?" The reporter replied in disbelief.</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "I went on a date," Nabiki paused. "You know, I can't remember his name at the moment." Nabiki said musingly. "I suppose the date didn't go according to his plans," Nabiki shrugged. "Next thing I knew, everyone was calling me the Ice Queen." She smiled. "It could have been worse." Nabiki said. "Still, I didn't date much in High School." She said. "And the one boy I might have been interested in, was more interested in my little sister."</p><p>"Lord Kuno?" The reporter asked.</p><p>"He was Tatewaki Kuno, The Blue Thunder, then." Nabiki laughed. "I don't think he liked me much in those days." Nabiki said in a confiding tone. "To be honest, I wasn't trying to be very likeable." Nabiki leaned back in her seat. "I really didn't have time for a boyfriend."</p><p>"And why is that, Nabiki?" The reporter asked in a fascinated tone. 'Oh gods, please don't let me fuck this up.' She prayed inwardly. 'This is going to be the interview of my life.'</p><p>"Had to take care of my family, for one." Nabiki replied. "Daddy did his best but we had a lot of expenses." She snorted. "It got worse once the Saotomes arrived."</p><p>"Speaking of the Saotomes." The reporter almost licked her lips in anticipation. "Ranma Saotome, there are so many rumors about him." She said in an inquiring tone. "Rumors that include your," The reporter paused. "Cousin, Ranko Tendo."</p><p>Nabiki grinned. "Well, it's really Ranma's secret to tell." Nabiki said in a teasing tone. "You really should ask," Nabiki's grin widened. "Them, yourself."</p><p>"If only." The reporter replied. She sighed and shook herself. "But back to you; you were saying, it got worse when the Saotome's arrived."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Trouble magnets, the both of them." Nabiki smiled slightly. "Though it was entertaining." Her smiled widened. "And profitable, very profitable." She laughed. "And it only got more profitable once my baby sister got involved."</p><p>"Which, and I apologize in advance, brings up what must have been the low point in your life; prison." The reporter asked almost hesitantly. "You must have thought your life was over."</p><p>Nabiki's face seemed to still. "Don't think I didn't consider it." She said in even tones. "There was a moment..." Nabiki's face softened. "but then I met someone who made me realize that the only way to go on, was to go on."</p><p>"Kimi Ota." The reporter guessed. Nabiki nodded. "You met her in prison." The reporter offered.</p><p>"You might say, I met me in prison." Nabiki replied. "Or more accurately, I met what I might have been without all the advantages I had." Nabiki smiled wryly. "It wasn't until I met Kimi that I realized that I even had advantages." Nabiki's eyes unfocused slightly in remembrance. "She helped me through the worst times." Nabiki suddenly smiled. "And made the good times, better." Nabiki crossed her legs. "We make a pretty good team." She said firmly.</p><p>"Maybe next time you could bring Ms. Ota with you." The reporter said casually. "I'm sure our audience would love to get to know her better." She said. 'Please say yes." She thought fervently.</p><p>Nabiki gave a noncommittal nod. "I think they'd like what they found out." Nabiki replied.</p><p>'That wasn't a no.' The reporter thought cheerfully. "I'd love the opportunity." The reporter looked at her notes. "You were released early." The reporter noted. She gave Nabiki an inquiring look.</p><p>"Good behavior." Nabiki said with a smile.</p><p>The reporter gave Nabiki a slightly disbelieving look but let it pass. "After you got out, you and Ms. Ota formed a partnership." The reporter said. Nabiki nodded."Obviously a successful one." The reporter added. "The two of you bought into your first business less than three months later." She observed. "And your second two months after that." Nabiki nodded with a proud smile. "By the end of your first year together you were already what most people would consider rich." The reporter shook her head in admiration. "Have the two of you ever considered writing a book on investing?" She asked. "I'm sure it would be a best seller."</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "I doubt some of our methods would be practical for some." She said cryptically. "Maybe one day." Nabiki teased.</p><p>"Well, if and when you do, I hope you'll come back to discuss it." The reporter replied. "Oh, it looks like we need to take a break for our sponsors." The reporter swiveled in her seat and turned to the audience. "More with Nabiki Tendo, the Ice Queen, when we come back." She said.</p><p>"And off." Called the director.</p><p>Stage hands came out from the wings and refilled water glasses, fixed the make up of the reporter and Nabiki, and generally checked to ensure the continued smooth running of the show. Throughout the break Nabiki maintained a composure that the reporter could not help but envy. "Do you need anything?' The reporter asked solicitously. Nabiki smiled and shook her head.</p><p>"And in five, four, three." The director held up two fingers, one and then pointed to the reporter.</p><p>"And we're back with our fascinating interview with Nabiki Tendo, the Ice Queen." The reporter said to the camera. She swiveled her chair to face Nabiki. The reporter looked at her notes. "In less than two years, you and Ms. Ota, acquired a fortune that most people would need a life time to achieve." She said. "And, forgive me again, a fortune that some say was fueled by an association with..." The reporter hesitated.</p><p>"Criminals?" Suggested Nabiki. "Unfortunately that is somewhat true." Nabiki frowned slightly. "Kimi and I made a mistake, we needed cash to bankroll some of our ventures and we didn't look too closely at who wished to invest."</p><p>"Tokio Wasuhara." The reporter said.</p><p>Nabiki nodded in obvious reluctance."It wasn't until much later that Kimi discovered the truth. I didn't believe it at first, but her evidence was solid." Nabiki leaned forward. "You must understand, while we were released from prison, we were still on parole. Still are." Nabiki said seriously. "We could have been sent back if we did anything even remotely illegal." Nabiki smiled sourly. "I even have to have my books audited four times a year." Nabiki waved a hand. "As soon as Kimi reported her findings we immediately contacted our parole officer."</p><p>"That would be Captain Chikato Noriudo." The reporter said.</p><p>"Captain Noriudo. Probably the hardest nosed, straightest arrow in the Tokyo Police force." Agreed Nabiki. "He almost sent us back to prison right then and there." She smiled slightly. "Fortunately Kimi and I were able to convince him we'd be more useful where we were."</p><p>'This is news.' The reporter thought excitedly. "Are you saying you went, what's the term, undercover?" She asked.</p><p>Nabiki waggled her head non-committedly. "We convinced Captain Noriudo that we could gather enough evidence to put Oyabun Wasuhara away for a long time." She said. "And we did." Nabiki said proudly. "Unfortunately, Oyabun Wasuhara must have learned that the police were on his tail and fled the country." Nabiki raised a hand. "I hope you don't mind if we don't speak of him anymore." Nabiki said. "It's a sore subject."</p><p>"Of course, Ms. Tendo." The reporter replied.</p><p>"Nabiki." Nabiki corrected with a smile.</p><p>"Nabiki." The reporter smiled and looked at her notes. "Why don't we go back to Lord Kuno." The reporter suggested. "You reconnected after your parole." To the reporter's surprise Nabiki giggled. "Nabiki?"</p><p>Nabiki waved a hand. "Not important." She said. Nabiki sighed in remembrance. "If anyone had told me I would fall in love with, let alone marry, Tatewaki Kuno, I would have laughed in their face." Nabiki looked down for a moment. "When we were in High School, I thought he was a fool."</p><p>"I gather he changed." The reporter said dryly. To the reporter's surprise Nabiki shook her head. "I don't understand, if he was a fool, as you say..."</p><p>"He was never a fool." Nabiki interrupted. "Obsessed with my sister, yes, but a fool never." She said. "If anyone was a fool it was me."</p><p>"You really shouldn't listen to her." A familiar masculine voice said from the wings. "She tends to blame herself for the faults of others." A tall, athletic figure strode on the stage. The studio audience erupted again in applause and more than a few squeals from the mostly female audience.</p><p>"Lord Kuno." The reporter said in astonishment. She quickly stood and bowed. "I had no idea, we didn't..."</p><p>Tatewaki raised a hand. "Please, no apologies." He said. "If anyone should apologize, it is I." He looked at Nabiki. "My Lady." He said in greeting.</p><p>"My Lord." Nabiki responded. Nabiki stood and was immediately swept up into Tatewaki's arms and in defiance of custom was kissed passionately.</p><p>"Ooooh." Murmured the audience.</p><p>"Close up." Hissed Saatchi Kato. "If you want to keep working, get a damn close-up." It was an unnecessary threat as the camera operator knew a great shot when he saw one. The camera slowly zoomed in on the couple. Saatchi Kato forced herself to stay calm when what she actually wanted to do was squeal along with the audience, though for different reasons. 'On my show.' She thought triumphantly. 'Thank you whatever gods planned this.' She thought fervently. The reporter made a mental note to visit a local Buddhist temple. 'My gods, they're still kissing.' She thought in envious disbelief.</p><p>"Break it up, you two." Came a soprano voice from the wings. Kimi Ota, in a long blonde wig and a business suit similar to Nabiki's only in white, walked on to the set. She walked over to Saatchi Kato. "I knew this was a bad idea," She said in resignation. "You'd think they hadn't seen each other for a week, rather than just three hours ago."</p><p>"Ms. Ota." The reporter said in astonishment.</p><p>"Call me, Kimi." She said. "Hang on." She turned to the still kissing Nabiki and Tatewaki. "Earth to Nabs and Tate." She said in teasing tones. They ignored her. Kimi walked over to Tatewaki and Nabiki and whispered something. Whatever she said was effective as they broke their embrace. "Sorry My Lady Nabiki, My Lord Tatewaki but..." She said.</p><p>"No, you were correct, My Lady Kimi, we were being rude." Tatewaki said contritely. He bowed to the reporter. "Please forgive us."</p><p>"No need to apologize, Lord Kuno." The reporter replied. To her approval, set hands had already brought out two additional seats and her assistant held two lapel mikes in her hands. "Please. Sit." She said. 'Oh please, sit.' She thought. The reporter sighed in relief as Tatewaki and Kimi sat in the pro-offered seats. She saw the director frantically signalling. "Our interview will continue, when we come back." She said to the camera.</p><p>"And off." The director said.</p><p>The reporter quickly turned in her seat. "Lord Kuno, Ms. Ota, you don't know how thrilled I am." She gushed. The reporter quickly tamped down on her enthusiasm. "Especially you, Ms. Ota." The reporter said. "I've been hoping to meet you for what seems like forever." The stage hands finished affixing the mikes to Tatewaki and Kimi and glasses of water were placed on the tables. The reporter glanced at a clock. "We have thirty seconds; is there anything else you require?"</p><p>Tatewaki chuckled. "No, I think I have everything a man could ask for." He said looking first at Nabiki and then, to the reporters surprise , Kimi Ota.</p><p>"And in five, four..." The director signaled with his hand.</p><p>"We're back." The reporter said. "For those just joining us, we have two additional and unexpected guests." She said. "Tatewaki, Lord Kuno." The camera panned to Tatewaki. "And Lord and Lady Kuno's constant companion, and Lady Kuno's business partner; Ms. Kimi Ota." The camera panned to Kimi. The reporter turned in her seat. "Welcome." She said.</p><p>"Thank you." Tatewaki replied. "Much as I wish otherwise, I must correct you." Tatewaki said somberly. "My Lady Nabiki and I are not yet married." He said. "Thus she cannot rightly be called Lady Kuno." Regret was obvious in Tatewaki's voice.</p><p>"If you don't mind my asking; what's stopping you?" She asked. "Surely not reticence on Ms. Tendo's part." She looked at Nabiki. "Don't tell me you're having cold feet." She said in some disbelief.</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "Hardly." She said. "No, the problem is logistics." Nabiki reached over to take Tatewaki's hand. "The only person Tatewaki and I trust to plan the wedding is Tatewaki's sister, Kodachi." Nabiki said.</p><p>"Oh, of course. I should have realized." The reporter said contritely. "And it's only been recently that Ms. Kuno has come out of mourning."</p><p>Tatewaki nodded. "We nearly canceled the engagement ball due to the death of her own betrothed; Ky Young Ji."</p><p>"They were engaged?" The reporter asked in surprise. "There was no, no mention, no announcement." The reporter sat back. "Yet she continued with your engagement ball." She pointed out.</p><p>"She needed to keep busy." Kimi Ota explained. "For the most part, it worked." Kimi said in sad tones. "She still needs to stay busy, but..." Kimi shrugged slightly. "One thing you learn about the Kunos, they are an amazingly strong and resilient family with a sense of duty that's almost frightening. Kodachi is a true Kuno and it is my honor to know her."</p><p>"For someone who supposedly was feuding with Ms. Kuno that is a surprising statement." The reporter commented.</p><p>"It wasn't exactly a feud." Nabiki interrupted. "Kodachi, rightly, was concerned about her brother's association with both Kimi and myself." Nabiki said. "Kimi was an unknown and I had a reputation of being, well, financially opportunistic."</p><p>"Ms. Kuno thought you were marrying Lord Kuno for his money?" The reporter guessed. Nabiki nodded. "And Ms. Ota?"</p><p>"I have a bit of a past." Kimi admitted.</p><p>"And it is, 'a past'." Tatewaki rumbled. "My Sister has long since changed her opinion and she and Lady Kimi have even developed something of a friendship." He said. "A fact that fills me with both pride and satisfaction."</p><p>The reporter's eyes widened slightly. "I notice you call Ms. Ota, Lady Kimi." She said slowly.</p><p>"A fitting title." Tatewaki interrupted the reporter. "Other than My lady Nabiki, there are few I would consider as noble or as honorable as Lady Kimi."</p><p>"He's gotten pretty smooth, hasn't he, My Lady Nabiki?" Kimi said impishly.</p><p>"Indeed, My Lady Kimi." Nabiki said in obvious imitation of Tatewaki's tone and cadence. She turned to the reporter. "And, believe me, as far as Kimi and I are concerned, if you looked up the word noble in the dictionary, it should have a picture of Tatewaki next to it."</p><p>"I'd give that an 'amen'." Kimi agreed in a quiet voice.</p><p>"My Ladies." Tatewaki said reprovingly. "You embarrass me." He nodded toward Saatchi Kato. "And we are ignoring our host."</p><p>"Please don't apologize, Lord Kuno." The reporter said. "It's obvious the three of you are, um, very close." She said. "Speaking of which, I understand the three of you share a penthouse in Nerima; isn't that difficult?" She asked. "The lack of privacy alone..."</p><p>Kimi and Nabiki exchanged amused looks. "Not really." Kimi replied. "It's a large apartment." She said with a smile.</p><p>"But still." The reporter persisted.</p><p>"There was a time." Kimi interrupted. "When Nabs and I were living under a threat." She said. "We needed a protector. Tatewaki became that protector." The adoring look she gave Tatewaki was echoed by Nabiki. "We got used to his being there."</p><p>"Wow." The reporter said under her breath. She fanned herself with her notes for a second. Then stopped when she realized what she was doing. The reporter took a sip of water. 'If there aren't three people in his bed, there should be.' She thought. She put the glass down. 'Better change the subject Saatchi, if you want them to come back..' She told herself. "I see. Well when you put it like that..." She caught Nabiki's eye. Nabiki nodded in both amusement and approval. A motion out of the corner of her eye made the reporter turn. "Amazing, it appears we're almost out of time." She said. "I want to thank all of you for coming today. It was a priviledge to meet all of you."</p><p>"It was our pleasure." Nabiki replied for all of them.</p><p>"I'm sure I speak for my audience when I express the hope that we could do this again." The reporter said hopefully. "And I especially want to thank for giving us the opportunity to get to know her better. To command such, such respect from the likes of Lord Kuno and the Ice Queen, well it's obvious you're someone special." She bowed her head respectfully. "Thank you." The reporter turned to the camera. "Well that's it for Japan Tonight. I am your host Saatchi Kato. Good night."</p><p>"And off." The director called.</p><p>Author's Notes: Well here, as promised, is Book 7. I'm breaking my self imposed rule of never publishing until a story is really complete. In this case, I am mostly complete. There are some open issues to close and a sidestory or two to write, but it's mostly done. Thanks to Wharpt and Matty29 for doing a little bit of pre-reading.</p>
