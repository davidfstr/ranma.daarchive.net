</div><p>Chapter 6</p><p>"To be a Kuno'</p><p>"Good Afternoon, Ladies. Gentlemen. Thank you for coming." Nabiki greeted her guests. "Please be seated." She looked around the table. This was a meeting of her senior people. After Tokio Wasuhara had been removed, Nabiki had reshuffled and reshaped her organization. She had combined some of the territories of some of the smaller organizations and redivided some others. Former leaders were now lieutenants and, in a few cases, some were no longer associated with her. What remained was represented by the four leaders in front of her; Kyoshi Nerumi, Kodachi Kuno, Kinnikun Honda and, their newest member, Genji Morimoto.</p><p>Sitting in her usual spot to Nabiki's right was Kimi Ota. Kimi, like Nabiki, was dressed in a tailored black business suit. Out of what might have been a fit of impishness they both wore their long blond wigs. Or possibly it was due to Tatewaki Kuno's presence at the wet bar.</p><p>Sitting just behind Kodachi was, as usual, Noriko Mata. While Noriko could have sat at the table, as Kimi did, the former prostitute preferred to maintain the illusion of being Kodachi's aide. An illusion that only Kodachi and possibly Nabiki actually knew was an illusion. Noriko had, with Kodachi's encouragement and support been taking over more and more of the daily responsibilities inherent in being a Yakusa lord.</p><p>Representing themselves were Kinnikun Honda, Kyoshi Nerumi and Genji Morimoto. Genji's presence was due to his actions against Tokio Wasuhara. Surprisingly, or maybe not, Genji refused any territory, forgoing it in favor of a percentage and the opportunities represented in coordinating all the shipping activities of Nabiki Tendo's organization, legal and illegal. Tokio's territory had instead been divided equally between Kyoshi, Nabiki and Kodachi. Kinnikun Honda had no need or desire for more territory, though his influence in Hokkaido had grown by virtue of his association with Nabiki.</p><p>Sitting at the bar and chatting with each other and Tatewaki were Makoto ,Yuki, Miki and Ami. Makoto because she was with Genji, Yuki because she went wherever Kodachi went and Miki and Ami were there just in case Kyoshi needed a little soothing. Or a reward. Both had volunteered. The meeting place was in an office in a fashionable part of Nerima. It was, in fact, the main office of IQ Holdings, Nabiki's primary business front.</p><p>Makoto leaned over to Yuki. "Genji's taking me to an onsen this weekend." She said in low tones so as not to disturb to business dealings going on. "Wanna go?" Makoto smiled enticingly. "You know Ms. Kuno wont say no."</p><p>"Did you ask Genji first?" Yuki shot back quietly. "I don't want a repeat of last time." Makoto nodded cheerfully. "Really?" Makoto nodded. Yuki looked over to the conference table. Genji was waving a hand as he made a point. Judging by the looks on the other peoples faces, whatever he was saying was very well received. As if aware of the scrutiny, Genji turned his head and looked at Yuki. Genji tilted his head in inquiry. Yuki smiled and nodded. Genji smiled widely and returned his attention to the meeting. "I guess I'm going." Yuki said.</p><p>"Yes!" Makoto exclaimed quietly.</p><p>"What is his secret?" Miki asked in complaint. "Come on guys, have a heart." She said plaintively. "A hint, just a hint." She pouted when both Makoto and Yuki shook their heads. "I'm going to get it out of you, you know that." Miki said warningly. "Oops." She said. "Looks like Kyoshi needs something." She got off the stool, walked over to the Yakusa lord and knelt down. The Yakusa whispered something. Miki nodded then whispered something back. The Yakusa lord smiled. Miki straightened and walked back to the bar.</p><p>"Looks like we have a date this weekend." Miki said to Ami. Ami rubbed her hands together in glee. "You have to admit," Miki said. "Kyoshi is hot." Ami nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Not my type." Makoto replied . "Right Yuki?" Yuki blushed. Makoto leaned closer. "Genji had this really, really great idea." She told the Kuno retainer. "And if you're a good girl, we can try it this weekend." Yuki blushed even redder. Makoto giggled. "And if you're a bad girl, we can try it tonight." Yuki's blush bordered on incandescent.</p><p>Tatewaki chuckled in amusement as he listened to the byplay between the 'girls'. When he had learned of Yuki's involvement with Genji Morimoto he was, at first, concerned that Yuki was only 'entertaining' Mr. Morimoto out of loyalty to her lady. Over time he had come to realize that there was an actual affection between his retainer, Makoto and the trucking magnate. And, the more he learned about Genji Morimoto, the more he approved of the relationship. 'Especially after his actions with helping to remove Tokio Wasahara.' He thought.</p><p>Tatewaki approved of all of his sisters 'girls' but none more so than Noriko Mata. He gave the brunette a fond look. Noriko was busy taking notes and, occasionally, whispering some point or suggestion into Kodachi's ear. He nodded in satisfaction. 'My sister lives again.' He thought. He looked at Kinnikun Honda. 'And loves again.' Not that Tatewaki fully approved of Kinnikun Honda, not because of his profession, Tatewaki was too honest with himself to fail to realize the hypocrisy, but rather he felt that the Yakusa lord had not yet, in Tatewaki's eyes, proven himself worthy of being more than a temporary, though welcome, fancy of his sister's.</p><p>"Looks like the meeting is breaking up." Miki's voice broke into Tatewaki's reverie. Tatewaki looked at the meeting. The various members of Nabiki's alliance were pushing away from the table and getting to their feet. Tatewaki nodded and touched a button next to a grating on the bar. "Cook, the meeting has adjourned." Tatewaki said.</p><p>"Five minutes, My lord." Cook's voice replied from the speaker.</p><p>"Thank you." Tatewaki replied.</p><p>Five minutes to the second there was a knock on the conference room door. Ami went to open the door and Cook, along with several assistants, rolled several trolleys into the room. The assistants quickly placed a white linen table cloth over the conference table and set dinner plates and utensils. Kodachi immediately took charge in arranging the seating. Placing her brother at the 'head' of the table should have been a given but Kodachi was all too aware of preventing any imagined slight to Nabiki and she found herself momentarily frozen in indecision.</p><p>"Tatewaki, you shouldn't have." Kimi said. "Actually, you should have." Kimi quickly amended with a smile. "Nabs was planning on giving us sandwiches."</p><p>'Thank you, Kimi.' Kodachi thought. "How do you put up with her, Lady Kimi?" Kodachi said. "Well, brother, take the head of the table as you are supposed to." She said. "Mr. Nerumi, you have the right, Mr. Morimoto the left." Kodachi smiled. "And, of course, Oyabun Honda will sit here." Kodachi indicated the seat opposite Tatewaki. "Girls, please take your seats as well." Kodachi fought down a impish grin. "That includes you, Ice Queen."</p><p>Nabiki did grin. "Well, If I'm one of the girls, then I suppose we can dispense with some of this tiresome formality." She said. "Wouldn't you agree...Kodachi?"</p><p>"It can be tiresome, can't it...Nabiki." Kodachi replied. With a nod to Nabiki, Kodachi sat herself to Kinnikun's right, while Noriko took the left. Miki and Ami looked at each other. "Miki, you sit on Mr. Nerumi's right." Kodachi ordered quietly. Kodachi looked at the Yakusa lord. "Miki is, after all, my senior girl, after Noriko that is."</p><p>Kyoshi raised an eyebrow. "And here I thought you chose her for her beauty." The Yakusa lord said genially. Miki giggled.</p><p>"Well that, as well." Kodachi replied.</p><p>The Yakusa lord shook his head. "I don't know how you do it, Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Kodachi, please." Interrupted Kodachi."The Ice..Nabiki did request some informality."</p><p>The Yakusa lord inclined his head. "So she did." He replied. "As I was saying, I don't know how you do it." He turned to Kinnikun Honda. "Some of my associates have complained, out of jealousy I suspect, that all the beautiful women work for or want to work for Kodachi Kuno."</p><p>Kinnikun Honda chuckled. "I have heard the same from some of my own people." He said.</p><p>"I must agree." Genji Morimoto added. "Though, and I hope you'll forgive my obvious bias, none more beautiful than the woman whom I wish to marry."</p><p>Makoto dropped her fork. "Genji?" She stammered.</p><p>"I know this is sudden, my pretty Makoto, but I couldn't think of a better time to propose." Genji Morimoto said. "And in what better company?"</p><p>Makoto swallowed. "R-really?" Makoto's eyes began to tear. "Oh Genji, do you mean it?" Genji nodded. "Oh Genji." Makoto swallowed and nodded.</p><p>"This is wonderful." Kodachi said in very pleased tones. "I do hope you'll allow me to make the arrangements."</p><p>"I would be honored if you would." Genji Morimoto replied. "Though I do hope you'll honor a request that the wedding be held where I met this beautiful woman."</p><p>"And the girls as bridesmaids?" Makoto said hopefully. "Oh Genji." Makoto half sobbed when Genji nodded genially. "Excuse me," Makoto said. "I have to, have to..." Makoto stood. "Yuki, please?" Without waiting, Makoto nearly fled from the conference room. Yuki made a hurried bow and followed.</p><p>Yuki hurried to catch up with Makoto and followed her into the nearest bathroom. Makoto was standing in front of a mirror. "You okay?" Yuki asked. Makoto nodded. "Well, you got your wish." Yuki said cheerfully. "You're going to be Makoto Morimoto." She said. Makoto nodded. Yuki sighed. "Well there goes the weekend." She half grumbled.</p><p>Makoto looked at Yuki in the mirror. "Genji was planning to propose all along." Makoto turned. "Even before he asked me to go to the Onsen with him." She walked over to Yuki. "So don't even think about not coming with us." She raised a finger. "Didn't I say I thought you'd help get him to propose?"</p><p>"Well, yeah, but." Yuki began.</p><p>"You're coming with us and no arguments." Makoto said firmly. "Now, help me fix my makeup." She said. "And then tonight you and I are going to show Genji how much we love him." Makoto smiled. "You do love him, don't you?"</p><p>Yuki lowered her head. "Yeah." she said quietly.</p><p>"Then it's settled. You're going." Makoto said firmly. Makoto suddenly giggled. "Maybe I should ask Genji to take you on the honeymoon too." Makoto snickered. "Now stop blushing and help me fix my makeup."</p><p>"Yes Makoto." Yuki replied.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The diners looked up as the conference room door opened and Makoto and Yuki walked back in. They quietly reseated themselves. "Sorry we were so long, Genji." Makoto said meekly.</p><p>"It's alright, pretty Makoto." Genji replied. "As long as you're saying yes."</p><p>"Genji Morimoto." Makoto scolded. "I've wanted to marry you since nearly the day I met you." She said. "Of course I'm saying yes."</p><p>"Then let me be the first to offer my congratulations." Kodachi said. "I suppose this time you really will be leaving the club."</p><p>"If that's what Genji wants." Makoto replied quietly.</p><p>"What, and have you give up your friends?" Genji replied in gentle tones. "I nearly lost you once because of that." Genji pointed out. "No, you can continue working for as long as you wish." Genji said generously. "And I suppose I will have to put up with the occasional ladies night out." Genji sighed theatrically.</p><p>"See why I love him, Ms. Kuno?" Makoto said happily.</p><p>Kyoshi Nerumi leaned over to Miki. "What is his secret?" He whispered. "I mean, he's nearly three times her age and I don't think it's because of his money."</p><p>"Don't ask me." Miki whispered back. "We've been trying to get it out of them for years."</p><p>"Them?" Kyoshi asked in curiosity.</p><p>"Yuki." Miki replied.</p><p>The Yakusa lord turned his head to look at the Kuno retainer sitting on Genji's left. "You're kidding."</p><p>"Nope." Miki replied in slightly sour tones.</p><p>The Yakusa lord chuckled. "Good for him." He said amiably. "Speaking of two women..."</p><p>Miki chuckled. "Baby, Ami and I are used to working together." She said. "And Ms. Kuno did say she wanted you to be...happy."</p><p>"Excellent." The Yakusa lord said approvingly.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nine year old Kiko Kobiashi walked to the center of the gymnasium with a determined look on her face. "Number 27, Kiko Kobiashi." Came the announcers voice over the noise of the crowd. Kiko raised a hand and smiled. The music started and Kiko's face returned to its previous serious mein. She started her routine with a tumbling run that brought applause from the crowd.</p><p>"That's right baby." Kodachi, wearing a black dress with a half veil covering her eyes, said. "Show them who's boss." The crowd oohed as Kiko achieved an incredible height as she back flipped through the air. Kodachi pumped a fist when Kiko stuck the landing. "Yes." She exulted. "That's my girl." Kodachi looked around the crowded gymnasium. To her satisfaction and pride nearly the entire crowd was focused on Kiko. The only exceptions, apparently, were those judges watching other girls compete.</p><p>"I can't believe that's my daughter." Koko Kobiashi said in awe.</p><p>"Believe it, Koko." Noriko, sitting between Kodachi and Koko, said. "That girl trains like a Kuno."</p><p>"And I know what that means." Koko shook her head. "You know I should be jealous." She said. "I never could get her interested in anything and I had to fight to get her to do her chores." Koko smiled lopsidedly. "Now she's the one reminding me," She said in emphasis. "To do my chores." Koko laughed. She shook her head. "Jealous, nooo, I don't think so." She said. "Look at her." She said. "My daughter can fly."</p><p>Sitting next to Koko was a delighted Pema and a disbelieving and awestruck Kagomi Akahito. "She's amazing." Kagomi breathed.</p><p>"Go Kiko." Shouted Pema. Kagomi picked up the shout and the two teen aged girls got to their feet and cheered Kiko on.</p><p>Kagomi leaned closer to Pema. "Thanks for inviting me." She said.</p><p>Pema smiled. When Kodachi had called to ask if Pema could babysit Kiko and some of her school friends, Pema had asked if she could bring Kagomi. Actually she asked Ranma first. To her pleasure Ranma thought it was great that Pema had a friend her own age and agreed. After clearing it with Kodachi, Pema immediately called Kagomi . While Pema and Kagomi had spoken several times on the phone since their first meeting, this was the first time they had gotten together.</p><p>"Pema happy you say yes." Pema replied. "Pema know you need help grampa."</p><p>"Oh gramps can handle the store for a day or three without me." Kagomi replied. She giggled. "Though I was afraid he was going to have a heart attack when the limo came to pick me up." Pema joined Kagomi in giggling. Kagomi gave Pema a shy smile. "Thanks." She said.</p><p>"We friends, yes?" Pema replied. Kagomi nodded. "Good." Pema said firmly. "Pema going need help this weekend." She said in admission. "Kiko good girl, but there be ten more girls." Pema giggled. "Pema just hope we be friends after weekend over." She said to Kagomi .</p><p>Kagomi giggled in understanding. Kagomi licked her lips. "Are we really going to stay at the Kuno mansion, I mean for a whole weekend?" She asked. Pema nodded. "Wow." Kigomi exclaimed. "A whole weekend."</p><p>Pema nodded. "That one more reason why Pema happy Kagomi here." Pema said. "Pema not like being away from Ranma. Pema get lonely but Pema think Kagomi keep Pema from be too lonely."</p><p>Kagomi smiled and nodded. 'I'm sure Ranma is happy to get her out of the apartment.' She thought to herself. 'Just for the privacy.' Kagomi smiled again. "Anytime." She said.</p><p>Kiko attacked her routine like a lioness stalking and bringing down her prey and the crowd oohed and ahh-ed with each successfully executed routine. Kiko did not hear the crowd, didn't see the crowd as her entire focus was on her routine. Finally, with a backward pike flip that had Kiko spinning in midair like a propeller, she stuck her landing and threw her arms into the air.</p><p>The crowd got to its' collective feet and roared in approval. But Kiko turned to the only people whose approval mattered. Her mother and her Auntie Dachi were on their feet with the crowd and Kiko fancied she could hear their cheers above the crowds. Kiko grinned then turned to wave to the crowd. The applause redoubled. Kiko threw her head back and basked in the sound.</p><p>Kodachi looked at her protege with pride written large on her face. 'It's a heady feeling, isn't it, baby?' Kodachi thought. 'Enjoy the applause, you''ve earned it.' Kodachi turned to Noriko. "Noriko." She said.</p><p>"Yes, Ms. Kuno?" Noriko replied.</p><p>"Please inform Cook that Miss Kiko has brought great honor to the Kuno household." Kodachi said in approving tones. "Please use those exact words, if you would, Noriko."</p><p>"Of course, Ms. Kuno." Noriko pulled out her cell phone and punched in the number. "Cook, please." She said. "Cook, Ms. Kuno wishes to advise you that Miss Kiko has brought great honor to the Kuno household." She said. "Yes, those were Ms. Kuno's words." Noriko nodded. "Yes, I would agree." She said. Noriko smiled. "Thank you, Cook." Noriko disconnected. Noriko punched another number. "Yoshi?" She said. "Noriko." She said in identification. Noriko smiled. "You should be here." She said. "Hopefully Gos is here and getting it all recorded." She snorted. "Yeah, no kidding." She nodded again. "Is everything set?" She asked. "Excellent. See you in about..." Noriko looked at her watch. "An hour at most." She disconnected.</p><p>The tournament continued with Kiko wowing the crowds in every event she was in, which was nearly all of them. Even before the tournament ended it was obvious that the only way Kiko would not finish first overall would be a rule change to exclude her.</p><p>"I think she's even better than I was at the same age." Kodachi said proudly. "No I take that back, I know she's better." Kodachi looked up as two people, a man and a woman, approached. "Ah, I was wondering when you two would show up." She shook her head. "No." She said firmly.</p><p>"But Ms. Kuno, she could be an star." The man protested.</p><p>"What do you mean, could?" Kodachi said cooly. "She will be." She said firmly. "And I will thank the two of you not to interfere." Kodachi raised her veil and glared at the two until they lowered their eyes. "Now, if there is nothing else..." The two shook their heads. "I thought not." Kodachi said. "Good afternoon then." The two people looked at each other and sighed. They nodded and walked away.</p><p>"Who was that?" Koko asked Kodachi.</p><p>"Two people who have a greater opinion of themselves then they deserve." Kodachi replied. "As if Kiko needs their help to make the Olympics." She said dismissively.</p><p>"Olympics?" Squeaked Koko. "I mean, she's good, but..."</p><p>"She's better than good, Koko." Kodachi interrupted. "As I should know." Kodachi clenched her hand into a fist. "The world will know of Kiko Kun...," Kodachi broke off with a horrified expression on her face. "Forgive me, Koko, I forget myself, I meant Kiko Kobiashi." She said in a rush. "Forgive me, please."</p><p>Koko's hand went to her scarred cheek. "Kobiashi is my, may he rot in hell, husband's name." Koko said fiercely. "The only good thing he ever did was give me Kiko." Koko looked at Kodachi. "I was thinking of changing my name back to Nagano." She said. "Except my family wants nothing to do with me either."</p><p>"Their loss." Noriko said.</p><p>"Indeed." Kodachi agreed. "Still, she is your daughter, not mine." She said in plaintive tones.</p><p>Koko laughed. "Sometimes I'm not so sure of that." She said. "Sometimes she acts more like a Kuno and I mean that in the best way possible." Koko blushed. "So, if you, well, Kuno is a very honorable name."</p><p>Kodachi raised her veil again and looked at Koko. Her eyes were shining. "Thank you, Koko." She said quietly. "We'll speak more later." She said. "In the meantime, it is time for our champion to get her due."</p><p>"And in first place overall, Number 27, Kiko Kobiashi." The announcer intoned. Kiko strode to the center of the gymnasium where the judges waited. She stopped in front of the judges and bowed. The judges bowed back and then presented Kiko with her trophy. Kiko looked at the trophy for a moment then raised it over her head. The audience erupted into applause.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Three limos pulled up in front of the Kuno mansion. From one, Kodachi Kuno, Noriko Mata and Koko Kobiashi emerged, the second and third erupted in a mass of nearly a dozen squealing nine and ten year olds and two teenaged girls. Pema and Kagomi quickly got the girls in a semblance of order and herded them into the mansion. Kodachi, Noriko and Koko followed at a more sedate pace.</p><p>"Yuki picked a good time to go away." Noriko said cheerfully.</p><p>Kodachi snorted in amused agreement. "Indeed." She said. "I just hope our two babysitters are up to the task."</p><p>"Oh, I think they'll be just fine." Koko said. She pointed with her chin. "Did you see how quickly Pema and Kagomi took charge?" She barked a laugh. "It was like watching two sheep dogs."</p><p>Kodachi and Noriko joined Koko in laughing. Kodachi and Noriko linked arms. Kodachi offered her free arm to Koko. "Shall we?" She said.</p><p>Koko looked at the arm for a second then linked her arm through Kodachi's. "Let's." Koko replied. She threw back her head and laughed. The three women walked into the mansion. Koko raised an eyebrow. "Where are the kids?"</p><p>A slim man in his twenties walked in from a side door. He wore a tailored suit that seemed to evoke a uniform in its severe cut. "We told Pema which rooms to take them to." The man said in answer. "They'll be back down after they're settled in."</p><p>"Thank you, Yoshi." Kodachi replied.</p><p>"Cook said to tell you all will be in readiness." Yoshi said with a smile. "I hope you'll forgive me if I say that, on behalf of your personal retainers, we are most proud." He bowed to the three women. "Most proud indeed." He repeated on straightening.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Pema and Kagomi spent the better part of an hour getting the pack of nine and ten year olds to settle in and settle down. "Still happy you here?" Pema asked in amusement. She and Kagomi shared a giggle. "It going be happy weekend, Pema just know."</p><p>"No climbing the furniture." Kagomi shouted. "If we live through it." She said in an aside to Pema. "Put that down." She scolded another pre-teen. She turned to a giggling Pema. "A little help, please."</p><p>"But you doing so well." Pema giggled. Pema clapped her hands together. "Okay, everyones settle down." To Kagomi's astonishment and chagrin the preteens all quickly quieted. "That better." Pema said. "Now, Pema want everyones be good." Pema looked over the crowd of young girls. "Everyones unpack?" She asked. There were general nods. "Good." She said. "Kagomi and Pema need unpack. You be good until we come back, yes?"</p><p>"Yes, Pema." Chorused the preteens.</p><p>"How'd you do that?" Kagomi asked as they left the suite containing the girls and headed to their own bedroom down the hall.</p><p>Pema shrugged. "Pema not know, just do." She said. "Pema hope Mr. Yoshi put bags in room." She said as she pushed open the bedroom door. "Oh good." She said. She pointed at the two small suitcases on the floor. She looked around. "This nice." She said.</p><p>"Nice?" Kagomi exclaimed. "Gramps and I live in less space."</p><p>Pema nodded. "When Pema in Tibet, whole family live in one room this size." Pema pointed. "Stove there. Water barrel there." She said. Pema pointed to another spot. "family sleep there." Pema counted on her fingers. "That six people."</p><p>"Six?" Kagomi exclaimed. "Man, and I thought I had it bad."</p><p>Pema shook her head. "That not bad. Nice having family close." She disagreed. "What bad is not having food." Pema shrugged. "That why Poppa sell me." She said. "For food."</p><p>Kagomi swallowed a lump that appeared in her throat. "You really were sold?" She asked quietly. Pema nodded. Kagomi blew out a breath. "Whoa." She said. "I guess we should unpack." Kagomi said. Pema smiled and nodded. Neither girl had brought a lot and unpacking and putting their clothes away didn't take long. "We better get back to the kids." Kagomi said. Pema nodded and the two girls walked back to the suite holding all the pre-teens.</p><p>Pema knocked. "It us." She said and opened the door. The pre-teen girls were sitting around the main part of the suite drinking juice, chatting and giggling. Pema looked around. "Where Kiko?" She asked one of the young girls.</p><p>"Mr. Yoshi came for her a couple minutes ago." The girl replied. "She should be back soon."</p><p>Pema nodded. "Okay, we wait until Kiko come back."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Yoshi and Kiko stopped at a door. He looked down at the nine year old. "Only those who love My lady may enter."</p><p>"You mean Auntie Dachi?" Kiko asked. Yoshi nodded. Kiko looked at the door. "Uncle Yoshi?" She asked. Yoshi made an inquiring sound. "Why do you call her My Lady?"</p><p>"Because she is." Yoshi replied simply.</p><p>"Do you love her?" Kiko asked.</p><p>Yoshi smiled. "Yes I do." He said. "Don't you?" He asked. Kiko nodded. Yoshi pointed to the door. "Then open the door, Kiko, and go inside." He said.</p><p>"It's going to be dark in there, isn't it?" Kiko said in slightly sour tones.</p><p>Yoshi laughed. "Yes it wll." He said. "Afraid?"</p><p>Kiko looked down at her feet. She nodded. "A little."</p><p>"Good." Yoshi said. "Fear is not always a bad thing." He said in a slightly teasing voice. "But believe in your Auntie Dachi and, I promise you, all will be well."</p><p>Kiko looked at Yoshi for a long moment, then turned her attention to the door. Kiko's hand went up to clasp the spider pendant around her neck. She took a deep breath and opened the door. She walked in. The room was, as she had expected, dark. She slowly advanced forward then stopped suddenly as she was surrounded by a blue light. Kiko's hand tightened on the spider pendant.</p><p>"Kiko Kobiashi?" Came a deep voice.</p><p>"Yeah?" Kiko said nervously. "Oh stop scaring her." Came a familiar voice. "Mommy?" Into the blue light stepped Koko Kobiashi. "What are you doing here?" Kiko asked.</p><p>"The same thing you're doing here, baby." Koko replied. Koko knelt down. "Who's your favorite person in the whole world?" She asked.</p><p>"You are mommy." Kiko replied. She smiled when her mother hugged her.</p><p>"Other than me, I meant." Koko replied. "Think carefully."</p><p>"Oh that's easy, Auntie Dachi of course." Kiko replied. "Why?"</p><p>"Cause I think she's my favorite person in the whole world, too." Koko replied. "Other than you, of course." She said. "And because she's my second favorite person in the whole world, I wanted to give her a present. Something special."</p><p>Kiko nodded enthusiastically. "Auntie Dachi deserves something special. Because she's special." Kiko declared. "What did you get her, mommy?"</p><p>"Well it's funny." Koko Kobiashi said. "In order for me to give her the present, I have to take something away from you."</p><p>"From me?" Kiko said in surprise. Then her expression firmed. "Well if it's for Auntie Dachi." She said. "Whatever it is, she can have it." Kiko declared.</p><p>Koko stood and took Kiko's hand. "I am here because I love My Lady." Koko said to the darkness. "As does my daughter." She said. "We have little enough to give, and most of what we do have, comes from My Lady." Koko looked down at her daughter. "I have two things to offer. One is nothing, meaningless. The other beyond price."</p><p>"What is meaningless?" Asked the voice.</p><p>"My name. Kobiashi." Koko replied. "I give it up gladly, easily."</p><p>"What is beyond price?" Asked the voice.</p><p>"My daughter. Kiko." Koko replied.</p><p>"Mommy?" Kiko asked in an unsure voice. Koko squeezed her daughter's hand reassuringly.</p><p>"And what would you wish in return for such gifts?" The voice asked.</p><p>"For me, nothing." Koko replied. "For my daughter, a name she can carry with pride." Koko bowed deeply.</p><p>"So be it. Koko Kobiashi is no more." The voice said. "Kiko." The voice said sternly.</p><p>"Y-yes?" Kiko said in nervous confusion.</p><p>"You're mother has requested a name to be proud of." The voice said. "What say you?" The voice asked. "If you could pick a name, any name, what name would bring you the greatest pride?"</p><p>"That's easy." Kiko said. "Kuno." Kiko declared.</p><p>"So be it." The voice said again. "From this day forth, you shall be known as Kiko Kuno." The voice said. "Daughter of Koko of the Kuno." The lights slowly came on to reveal a stocky man sitting in a chair and a slender woman standing just behind him.</p><p>"Auntie!" Kiko said in surprise.</p><p>"Hi Baby." Kodachi said almost shyly. She knelt down and spread her arms. "Come here."</p><p>Kiko looked at her mother. Koko smiled and nodded. Kiko ran over to Kodachi. Kodachi wrapped Kiko in her arms. When Kodachi pressed her cheek against Kiko's, the little girl pulled back. "Auntie, you're crying."</p><p>"Happy tears, baby." Kodachi said reassuringly. "Happy tears."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The door to the suite opened and Kiko walked in. She smiled as all her friends shouted her name in greeting. Kiko went and sat down in the circle of girls. "You're awful quiet, Kiko." One of the girls said. "You okay?"</p><p>Kiko nodded. "Yeah." Kiko took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "Where's Pema and Kagomi?" She looked around. "Oh, there they are." She said when she saw Pema and Kagomi sitting together and talking.</p><p>"They're really nice." Another girl said. Kiko nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Are you sure you're okay?" The first girl asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Kiko smiled. "Just a little tired." She said in explanation. Kiko stretched her arms over her head. "I don't know about you guys but I'm hungry." She said. "Hey Big Sister, when do we eat?"</p><p>Pema smiled. "We just waiting for you get back." Pema stood and clapped her hands. "Everyones." She said. "We go downstair now." She said. "And no one run, yes?"</p><p>"Yes, Pema." Chorused the young girls. Pema and Kagomi quickly got the girls lined up. Pema pressed a button on a grating next to the door. "This Pema, we have lots hungry little girls." There was a chuckle from the grating. "Bring them down, Pema." A deep voice replied. "Thank you, Mr. Cook." Pema said. "Okay we go now." She said to the girls. "Remember no run." Pema opened the door and led the girls out of the room. Kagomi took up the rear.</p><p>'I don't know how she does it.' Kagomi thought in admiration. 'All she does is clap her hands and, poof.' Kagomi smiled. 'This is going to be a great weekend.' She thought gleefully.</p><p>The pre-teens and their two teenaged babysitters left the suite and down the stairs to the main part of the mansion. While Pema seemed to be able to keep them mostly under control. It was only 'mostly'. Even getting them to go downstairs in one group took all of Pema and Kagomi's skill and patience but in the end she got them lined up outside the dining room. The dining room doors opened.</p><p>"Oooh." Chorused the young girls. The dining room had been transformed and made young girl friendly. In other words it was pink. Pink bunting, pink banners. Apparently the only reason the table cloth was white was so the pink plates and utensils would stand out. In the center of the table was a huge pink and white cake. An even larger banner spanned an entire wall, it read 'Congratulations Kiko Kuno.' Kiko giggled and clapped her hands together in glee.</p><p>End Chapter 6</p><p>Author's Notes: Originally this was going to be broken into two or three chapters (there's still more to to happen) but because I've been late in releasing a chapter I thought I'd make amends by releasing it as one long chapter. Oh, and I apologize for the delay in getting any lemons requested. It's been very busy at work recently.</p>
