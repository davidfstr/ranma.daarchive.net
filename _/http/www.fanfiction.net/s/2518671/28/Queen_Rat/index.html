</div><p>Chapter 2</p><p>'Making the team'</p><p>Ting Li undressed, put on a nightgown and, with a sigh, got into bed. She had been living with Ranma and his women for several weeks. While there were two futons in the bedroom, neither Akane nor Ukyo had slept in it. 'They still don't trust me.' She thought moodily. She had gone on several patrols and assignments with them and, she admitted to herself, she had a long way to go before she could truly consider herself a member of the team. Still, she had hoped, that Akane, at least, would begin to accept her. Ting Li looked up as the door opened and Akane walked in. Ting Li began to get to her feet.</p><p>"Stay where you are Ting Li." Akane said cheerfully. "Ukyo needed some alone time with Ranma." She said in way of explanation. "Go to sleep."</p><p>"Not sleepy." Ting Li replied honestly. "Bored."</p><p>Akane chuckled. "Yeah, I bet."</p><p>"You mind we talk?" Ting Li asked. She moved her pillow and sat up in bed. She watched as Akane disrobed and pulled a pair of yellow pajamas from a dresser drawer. Akane put the pajamas on and got into the other futon.</p><p>"What do you want to talk about?' Akane asked.</p><p>"Anything." Ting Li said almost pleadingly. "I know almost nothing about you, about Ukyo, about Ranma. I know you not trust me but," Ting Li broke off. "Please, just talk to me."</p><p>Akane patted her pillow and arranged the quilt to her liking before she answered. "Trust is something you earn Ting Li." She said almost to herself. "Once lost, it's almost impossible to regain."</p><p>"You lose Ranma's trust?" Ting Li asked quietly. Akane nodded. "But you get it back." Ting Li pointed out. "Yes?"</p><p>"Mostly." Admitted Akane. "But," She sighed. "It's not what it was."</p><p>"But, but he love you." Ting Li said firmly. "Anyone with eyes see that." Ting Li leaned forward and wrapped her arms around her knees. "He always watch you, always stand close." She waved a hand. "Oh I think he love Ukyo but not same way."</p><p>Akane smiled briefly. "Maybe." She said. "But don't you dare tell Ukyo that." She said seriously. "I depend on that woman."</p><p>Ting Li nodded. "Spirit sisters." She said quietly. She looked at Akane. "Thank you." She said. "For trusting me, even this little bit."</p><p>"Good night Ting Li." Akane lay back against the futon.</p><p>"Good night Akane Tendo." Ting Li lay down and closed her eyes and was soon asleep.</p><p>The next morning found the four on the roof. "Okay." Ranma said. "I think we have a good idea of Ting Li's level of skill." He looked around. "The question is; how do we use it? Any ideas Tomboy?"</p><p>Akane pursed her lips in thought. "You're faster then you're strong." She said to Ting Li. "And I like what you did to the 'Splitting Cat Hair' technique." Akane continued her assessment. "I think," Akane paused. "I think we have to flank her Uk-chan." She said. "No." Akane corrected herself. She raised a finger. "Point." She raised her other hand and made a 'V' with two fingers. The single finger of her other hand moved through the two fingers. "Point. Center and Rear." She said. "When she's point or rear, Ukyo and I can fight normally."</p><p>Ranma rubbed his chin. "Not bad Tomboy." He said approvingly. "And in a real tough situation the three of you can make a strong defensive triangle." He nodded. "Or you might need to protect someone."</p><p>"That means Ting Li," Ukyo stopped. "Sorry sugar." She said to Ting Li. "That puts you at our back when Ranma leads the charge."</p><p>Ting Li found herself the focus of three pairs of eyes. She looked at Akane for a long moment. 'She's giving me a chance." She straightened and looked at Ukyo. "Then I best prove you can trust me." She said seriously. "I not want possible enemy at my back."</p><p>"How you going to do that sugar?" Ukyo asked calmly.</p><p>"You tell me." Ting Li said in the same tone. "You name test. Not care what it is. I either accept or not."</p><p>Ukyo held Ting Li's gaze for a long momen the she turned her head and looked at Akane. "Sugar?" She asked the dark haired girl. Akane waved a hand passing the decision back to Ukyo. Ukyo raised an eyebrow and then turned back to Ting Li. "You know you'll have to dance." She said.</p><p>Ting Li nodded. "Figure that." She smiled wryly. "Think you teach me how?" She asked. There were three quiet snorts of amusement at her words. "I dance, just not want look stupid." She added with a shy smile.</p><p>"Too easy Uk-chan." Akane commented. "The fact that she hasn't left showed that."</p><p>"She's got a point Uk-chan." Ranma said cheerfully. He looked at Ting Li appraisingly. "Nah." He said musingly. "You'd probably do that." He pulled his pigtail from behind his back and looked at the end. "You that sure about her Tomboy?" He asked quietly.</p><p>Akane exhaled a sigh. "Yeah." She admitted. "I think she's for real."</p><p>"I can't believe I'm the holdout." Ukyo muttered. "What did you guys do last night?' She put a teasing tone in her voice.</p><p>Akane shrugged slightly. "We talked." She said. "That's all." She looked up as Ranma stepped closer and Akane found herself in a hug. 'Mmm." She purred. "Not that I'm complaining." She began.</p><p>"Shut up Tomboy and just let me hug you." Ranma replied quietly. Akane nodded. Ranma tightened the hug. He looked at Ting Li over the top of Akane's head. "Okay Ting Li you've earned a place on the team but that's all you've earned." He said with a slight smile. "Understood?"</p><p>"Understood Ranma Saotome." Ting Li replied. "Trust something you earn." She said. She looked at Akane wrapped in Ranma's arms. Ting Li turned to Ukyo. "You think you start teach me dance now?" She made a quick move of her head to indicate Ranma and Akane.</p><p>Ukyo tilted her head to the side in almost a nod. "Sure sugar." She said. "Why don't you and I go back to the apartment." She turned and started walking away. Ting Li quickly came along side, the two women matched strides. "Why?" Ukyo asked when they reached the stairs down.</p><p>"Just being good partner." Ting Li replied. "She deserve time with her man, no?"</p><p>"You'll still fuck him if you have the opportunity though, won't you" Ukyo said conversationally.</p><p>"You do." Ting Li replied evenly. "He belong her, agreed?" She said firmly.</p><p>"Agreed." Ukyo replied quickly. The walked down the stairs. "I offered to leave, you know." Ukyo said quietly.</p><p>"Oh no." Ting Li said almost angrily. "It too late for that now." She declared. "You stay until she tell you leave." She stopped and looked at Ukyo. "Now you tell me why. What she do that you had to do this to get them together again?"</p><p>Ukyo looked down. She shook her head. "What good would telling you do?" She said quietly. "All you need to know is that it was my fault. Okay?"</p><p>"I already figure that." Ting Li replied. "It reason why you call Ranma slut? Yes?"</p><p>Ukyo blew out a breath. "No." Then she chuckled. "That came later." She gave Ting Li a penetrating look. "Not yet Ting Li. Maybe one day we'll tell you but not today."</p><p>"I hold you to that." Ting Li replied. "Now you teach me dance, yes?"</p><p>"Good evening ladies and gentlemen." The MC said from the center of the stage. "Yes, there are some ladies here." He smiled at the chuckles that came from the oft spoken phrase. "On the other hand I certainly wouldn't to make any bets on the number of gentlemen." The chuckles turned to actual laughs. 'Who'd of thought I'd actually need a real act to work in a strip joint.' Tatsuo loosened his collar. "Now as you know it's Thursday night and Thursday night is what?" He held the microphone out to the audience.</p><p>"Amateur night." A number of the regulars shouted back.</p><p>"That's right." Tatsuo smiled. "We've seen some beautiful women come and go and some of the best started right here. One of your favorite girls in fact, Sugoi, won an amateur competition." Tatsuo sighed. "And the rest, as they say, is history." He smiled. "If we're lucky, history will repeat itself." He waved a hand. "Let's not waste any more time wondering." He said. "Let's give a warm round of applause for our first contestant, Ai."</p><p>Ting Li paced nervously behind the curtain waiting for her turn. "Relax sugar." Ukyo said. "You'll be fine."</p><p>"Easy for you to say." Ting Li replied. "Where Ranma and Akane?" She asked. "I thought they be here."</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "They're here sugar." Ukyo's grin got wider. "They're here."</p><p>Ting Li narrowed her eyes at Ukyo but despite everything she could do Ukyo refused to give any more information. Finally it was Ting Li's turn. She placed a wide smile on her face.</p><p>Tatsuo walked out on stage applauding the previous dancer. "The competition just keeps getting tougher, doesn't it?" There were some shouts of agreement."And it's just about to move up a notch. All the way from China. Let's give a warm Kabuki theater welcome for;" He grinned. "Tingly."</p><p>The curtain opened and Ting Li back flipped on to her hands. Her legs spread wide into a split. She turned around on her hands then rolled forward and maintained the split. The applause her move evoked seemed to calm Ting Li and she continued through the set. 'I still not see,' Ting Li's thought broke off. 'There he is, but where Akane?' Ranma waved a bill at Ting Li and she strode over the way Ukyo taught her. Ting Li gyred downwards until she was squatting in front of Ranma.</p><p>Ranma waved the bill again and Ting Li leaned forward. Ranma deftly placed the bill between the Amazon's bra covered breasts. "Not bad." He mouthed. Ting Li stood spread legged in front of Ranma and reached behind her slowly and unsnapped her top. She grabbed the bra before it could fall and leaned over closer to Ranma and let the bra slide off her breasts. She smiled as Ranma's eyes widened in appreciation.</p><p>Ting Li smile became triumphant. She saw a tall, powerfully built man, sitting next to Ranma, wave a bill. Ranma waved her on. Ting Li spun away to stand in front of the man. She squatted down. Seeing the size of the bill in the man's hand she remembered Ukyo's instructions. "Guy waves a big bill, he's going to want a show. Give it to him." She had said. Ting Li supported herself on her hands and spread her legs in a split. She smiled at the man through the 'V' of her legs. She almost fell when she suddenly realized that the man was Akane. She forced the smile to remain on her face. Akane waved the bill. Suddenly Ting Li grinned. 'She want show, she get show.' Ting Li's legs suddenly shot forward and grabbed Akane's head between her thighs.</p><p>The crowd roared.</p><p>"Enjoy show?" Ting Li asked later in the dressing room. Ting Li had won as expected and the group was celebrating in the small dressing room in the back.</p><p>"Yep." Akane grinned. He waved a hand down his body. "And I'm in the right form to fully appreciate it."</p><p>"Oh who are you kidding sugar?" Ukyo said cheerfully. "Your form has nothing to do with it." She turned to Ting Li. "The girl switch hits every chance he gets." She confided to Ting Li eliciting a giggle from the orange haired girl. "Now get dressed." She ordered Ting Li. "We're going out to celebrate."</p><p>Ting Li walked along the neon lit streets of downtown Tokyo. Even at this late hour it was a bustle of activity. To her surprise the person on her arm was Ukyo. Walking just behind them holding hands were the male Ranma and male Akane. Ting Li leaned over to Ukyo. "Do they...?" She looked back at Ranma and Akane. "Like that?"</p><p>"Yeah." Ukyo whispered back. She rubbed her butt reflexively. "Not often but yeah." She smiled wryly. "Got to admit it's hot watching them."</p><p>"Aiyah." Ting Li looked back over her shoulder. She looked forward quickly. "They kissing." She hissed. "What if someone see?"</p><p>"Who'd be stupid enough to say something?" Ukyo said calmly.</p><p>Ting Li's mouth turned up on one side. "Good point." She said. "We make sure no one bother them yes?"</p><p>"Don't worry sugar where we're going," Ukyo grinned. "You'll see." Her eyebrows raised as Ting Li giggled. "What's so funny?"</p><p>"Just thinking this not what I expect." Ting Li confided. "In head I imagine something from stories. Training every day, meditation, living frugally." She giggled again. "Well we do but not way I imagine." Ukyo laughed. "Must admit it more fun this way." Ting Li concluded.</p><p>"That it is sugar." Ukyo said. She pointed. "Here we are." She pointed to a building just ahead.</p><p>"Black Orchid?" Ting Li looked at the building. "Aiyah there long line." She said. "We never get in."</p><p>"Want to bet?" Came Akane's baritone voice from behind. "Just watch." Akane led the way toward a velvet rope. Even before they made it to the door, the bouncer was unhooking the rope.</p><p>"Hey guys." The bouncer called as they approached. "Good to see you."</p><p>"Hey Mako." Ranma called. He high-fived the bouncer. "Same." He waved a hand. "That's Ting Li. She's joined the team."</p><p>"Yeah?" Mako replied. The bouncer was typical of his type. Big as a sumo wrestler there were few he feared. He gave Ting Li an appraising look. "Cool." He said finally. He stuck out a paw of a hand. "Any friend of Ranma's is a friend of mine." He said with a smile. "I'm Mako."</p><p>"Ting Li." Ting Li replied. She had made her own assessment She took the man's hand and shook it firmly. Ting Li waved good-bye as she followed Ranma, Akane and Ukyo into the club. Ting Li's eyes quickly adjusted to the dim interior. Even without the bouncer letting them in, it would have been quickly obvious that her companions were well known and popular. Ting Li found herself introduced to more people then she could ever be expected to remember and just smiled cheerfully.</p><p>"Let's find a table Tingly." Ranma grinned. "I want to dance."</p><p>Ting Li rolled her eyes. "You hit him for me." Ting Li asked Akane. "Yes?"</p><p>"I don't know." Akane said with a laugh. "It could be worse." Akane smiled. "He calls me Tomboy, you know."</p><p>"You are a Tomboy." Ranma replied.</p><p>Ting Li spread her hands in defeat. "You go dance." She said. "I find table."</p><p>"Nah." Ranma replied. "I'd rather not split up until we get to our table first." Ranma looked around. "There it is." He pointed.</p><p>"There people already there." Ting Li followed the group to a table near a corner. A couple sat there. As they approached she could see the young man's eyes widen. He turned to his date a very pretty young brunette. The young woman sprang to her feet.</p><p>"Ranma." The young woman greeted cheerfully and ran over.</p><p>"Hey Konatsu." Ukyo greeted the Kunoichi with a hug.</p><p>"Miss Ukyo." Konatsu greeted the chef warmly. Konatsu turned and eyed the tall man. His eyes widened. "Ooh someone is being bad tonight." Konatsu squealed. "Hey Akane."</p><p>"Hey Konatsu." Akane replied.</p><p>"Who's your date?" Asked Ranma.</p><p>Konatsu reached over and pulled his date to his feet. "This is Junro." He said. Konatsu looked doe eyed at the young man. "Isn't he cute?"</p><p>"H-hi." Junro said self-consciously. "You're them, the Terrible Three, aren't you?" He said. His voice seemed to vibrate with nerves.</p><p>"Oh don't worry Junro." Konatsu pulled the young man back to the table. "I'll protect you." He cooed. Konatsu noticed Ting Li. "Who's your friend?"</p><p>Ranma smacked his forehead. "Oh sorry, Konatsu this is Ting Li. Ting Li this is Konatsu."</p><p>The two martial artists sized each other up. Ting Li tilted her head in puzzlement. "You look like girl. You act like girl. Why I no think you girl?" She asked quietly.</p><p>"That's cause he's not." Ukyo said. "Just ask cutie over there." She nodded her chin at Junro. The young man blushed. Ukyo turned back to Ting Li. "Pretty good instincts. Most people are fooled."</p><p>"Was fooled." Ting Li replied. She shrugged. "Just feeling."</p><p>"Good instincts." Ukyo said again in approval..</p><p>"Hey guys, Ranma and I are going to dance." Akane said. He took Ranma's hand in his and half dragged Ranma on to the dance floor.</p><p>"So, what do you think?" Ukyo waved her hand to take in the club.</p><p>Ting Li looked around before answering. She observed Ranma and Akane slow dancing together in the middle of the dance floor. She noticed that they weren't the only same sex couples. She blinked as she suddenly realized how many of the people here were dressed as the opposite sex. The remaining dancers seemed a mix bag of more usually dressed people and one or two in some fantastic costume. She spotted one woman, she assumed it was a woman, dressed in what appeared to be tight, black leather. "Wonder where I get one of those." She murmured. Her eyes drifted to where cross-dressing Konatsu was cuddled up to her date. She leaned over to Ukyo. "He not doing what I think he doing?" She asked in a whisper.</p><p>Ukyo glanced over to Konatsu and Junro. Konatsu's hand was under the table and by the glazed look on Junro's face, she could guess what that hand was doing. "Yup." Ukyo replied. "You didn't answer the question."</p><p>"That because I not have answer." Ting Li replied. "It all so different then I imagine."</p><p>"So you said." Ukyo replied. "What was it; training, meditation and living frugally?"</p><p>Ting Li nodded. "And live in monastery." She waved her hand to indicate the club. "This no monastery." She pointed her chin at Konatsu. "And he no monk." She rubbed the back of her head. "It not supposed to be fun." She half grumped. She smiled at Ukyo's laugh.</p><p>"Ah but that's the genius of the Saotome method of training." Ukyo said wryly. "Everything is training to Ranma." She looked out to the dance floor. "Even dancing." Ukyo chewed the inside of her cheek in thought. "In many ways dancing is exactly like a martial art. You need strength and flexibility and both do forms." She indicated where Ranma and Akane were dancing to a hip-hop rhythm. Ranma and Akane's both leaned over and kicked out horizontal to the ground as their arms shot to the sides. They then pulled their legs back in and straightened up. The two men in perfect sync. "Back kick and double groin punch." She explained.</p><p>Ting Li turned back to the dance floor. Her eyes widened. "It kata." She breathed. "Oh that so, so clever."</p><p>"That's Ranma." Ukyo said proudly. "Okay enough talk." Ukyo said decisively. "Let's have some fun." She turned her head. "Watch the store Konatsu." She said. Ukyo took Ting Li's hand and pulled her on to the dance floor. "Don't worry sugar. Konatsu may be occupied but he isn't oblivious. Our stuff is safe." Ukyo guided them to Ranma and Akane. "Move over Akane I want a dance." She pulled Ting Li forward. "Here dance with the new girl."</p><p>Ting Li found herself in Akane's arms. "Um. Uh." Mumbled Ting Li. The next thing she knew she was being spun around like a top. In spite of her best efforts she began to giggle. 'I sound like a school girl.' She thought to herself. 'Oh what the hell, this is fun.' She grinned.</p><p>The evening went by in a rush to Ting Li. She danced with Akane, to her delight she danced with Ranma. She danced with Ukyo. To her surprise she even danced with Konatsu. It seemed, to Ting Li, that no time had passed from between the time they first entered the club and now, when they were walking down to darkened streets and toward home. Ting Li did a little turn step, almost a pirouette, as she walked.</p><p>"Someone's in a good mood." Akane observed.</p><p>"Why I not be in good mood." Ting Li replied cheerfully. "Today first time I feel like part of team." Impulsively she threw her arms around Akane's neck and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. "Thank you."</p><p>Akane shrugged. "We," He waved his hand to indicate Ranma and Ukyo. "We think you've earned it."</p><p>"Thank you." Ting Li said again. She surprised herself by linking her arms through Akane's. "You been too, too kind to me." Ting Li continued.</p><p>Akane looked down at Ting Li. "You certainly are different than Shampoo." He said thoughtfully. "She would have been scheming to break us up."</p><p>"Shampoo always impatient." Ting Li said dismissively. "Now that I know you, I think stupid better description. Better to be friend then rival." A pout came to Ting Li's face when their apartment came into view. "Wish night not end." She said wistfully. They walked up the three flights of stairs to their apartment. Ting Li sighed slightly. "I think I say goodnight now." She said. "Try not to make noise."</p><p>Ting Li went to the bathroom and gave herself a quick sponge bath. 'I'll take a real shower in the morning.' She promised herself. Walking back to the bedroom she passed Ranma and Akane. She smiled at the two men. 'Got to admit, Akane makes a good man.' She thought and made her way to the spare bedroom. To her disappointment it looked like she was sleeping alone again. 'Oh well, that would be too much to ask for.' She put on a night gown and was about to get into bed when the door opened.</p><p>"The guys and I talked." Ukyo said from the doorway. "We have one more test for you." She beckoned with her hand. "Come on."</p><p>Ting Li quickly threw on a robe and followed Ukyo out of the bedroom. To Ting Li's surprise Ukyo led her to the other bedroom. Ukyo pointed to an easy chair near the bed. "Sit." Ukyo commanded. Ting Li sat. "Now you sit there until we tell you to move." Ting Li nodded. Ukyo walked out of the bedroom. Ting Li looked around curiously. She found herself alone for a long time. Though impatient and a little apprehensive she stayed in the chair. 'Well it's comfortable at least.'</p><p>The door opened and the male Akane, in pajamas, walked in. Akane walked over to the chair and sat on one of the arms. "Got to admit you did pretty good tonight." Akane commented.</p><p>Ting Li ducked her head. "Thank you Akane." She said. Ting Li found herself becoming very aware of Akane's masculine scent. She swallowed. "Are you last test?' She asked nervously.</p><p>"Maybe." Akane smiled slightly. "You would, wouldn't you?" Akane chuckled. "Looks like Ranma was right." He shrugged. "Maybe." He repeated. "Do you think you can stay in that chair and watch?" He asked coolly.</p><p>"Watch?" Ting Li looked at Akane then at the bed. "You want me watch?" She took a breath. "Would you watch if Ranma ask?" She said in disbelief.</p><p>"I did." Akane replied.</p><p>"Aiyah." Ting Li gave a low whistle. "Ranma make you watch?" Akane nodded. Ting Li took another deep breath. "And yet you still here." She said quietly.</p><p>"I lost his trust." Akane said with a familiar twinge of self-hate. "That was the chance he offered." His face firmed. "And I took it."</p><p>Ting Li looked into Akane's face. "Then this punishment?" Ting Li asked quietly.</p><p>"In a way." Akane admitted. "You, me, Ukyo, we all keep treating Ranma as a thing. Yes he's beautiful, yes he's talented and , gods, he's a wonderful lover but, for the longest time, we treated him as a prize to be won." Akane looked toward the door of the bedroom. "He's a total slut and," Akane sighed. "We made him that way."</p><p>"Akane?" Ting Li looked down. "Why you man"</p><p>"Besides the obvious?" Akane asked. "How else can I learn to understand him?" She asked. Akane ran a hand through her hair. "They say couples start to look and act alike as they live together. I guess it's true." Akane smiled at Ting Li's chuckle. "And to be brutally honest I'm as big a slut as he is."</p><p>Ting Li licked her lips. "I no mind." She said huskily. "You very beautiful. You very talented." She licked her lips again. "And I bet you too, too wonderful lover." She said. "You think maybe sometime just you and me?" Her mouth broke into a wide smile. "I even no mind if they watch."</p><p>Akane laughed. "Well that was one of the options we talked about." Akane admitted. "Come in guys." He called to the door. The door opened and a grinning Ranma and Ukyo walked in.</p><p>"You guys still have your clothes on?" Ukyo said in disbelief. She grinned at Ting Li's blush. "Getting slow sugar."</p><p>"Ting Li thought it would be more fun if you two watched." Akane laughed in his baritone.</p><p>"Told ya." Ranma smirked. He laughed as he deflected Ukyo's elbow that was heading for his ribs. "You're just jealous." He told the chef. "Or is it greedy?" Ranma looked at Ting Li. "Don't mind Ukyo, she's just annoyed that she's going to have to share tonight."</p><p>"Well yeah." Ukyo mock grumped. "Who wouldn't? What girl wouldn't want to be the center of attention?"</p><p>"Busted." Akane said cheerfully. "Don't worry Uk-chan, I'm sure Ting Li will give you some attention. Won't you Ting Li?" Akane's tone made it not a question.</p><p>"Oh not worry Ukyo." Ting Li said hurriedly. "I never with girl before but you teach me yes?" A shy smile came to her face. "You very good teacher."</p><p>"Well in that case." Ukyo rolled her eyes then looked at Ting Li. "Good thing we don't have to work tomorrow."</p><p>"Today." Corrected Ranma.</p><p>"Smart ass." Grumbled Ukyo. "Like I was saying; good thing we don't have to work any time soon, because we're gonna need our rest." She looked at Ranma and Akane. She shook her finger at the two of them. "And I meant that as a promise from you two."</p><p>"Looks like we're being challenged Tomboy." Ranma said to Akane. The two currently men grinned at each other.</p><p>"So that mean I no have to watch?" Ting Li asked. She licked her lips in anticipation. "I mean it okay, I not want Ukyo mad at me."</p><p>"It'a okay sugar." Ukyo said. "I'm not mad." Ukyo grimaced. 'I think.' She thought to herself.</p><p>Ting Li dragged herself out of the tangle of arms and legs and staggered to the bedroom door. "Aiyah." She moaned. "They insatiable." She rubbed her butt. "I not be able to sit for week." She reached the bathroom and looked in the mirror. A slow smile came to her face. "Oh but it felt so, so good." She said quietly. "Shower. I need shower." Since she was already nude she just turned the water on, waited until the temperature reached a comfortable level and stepped in. "Ahh." She quickly soaped herself up and let the water sluice the suds off. She didn't hear the door to the bathroom open and someone enter until the shower door opened.</p><p>Akane entered the shower and immediately returned to her female form as the hot water hit her. "Insatiable huh?" Akane giggled. "We're just athletic."</p><p>"Is that what you call it?" Ting Li rolled her eyes. "Turn around, I wash your back."</p><p>"You don't have to ask me twice." Akane turned around and sighed happily when Ting Li started soaping her back. "Was it what you hoped for?"</p><p>Ting Li snorted. "You just looking for compliment." She said. "I hope you not like that all time." She said in mild complaint. "And Ranma, he like machine."</p><p>"Yeah." Akane sighed happily. "Believe it or not most of the time he's a lot more gentle."</p><p>"He showing off, yes?" Ting Li turned and let Akane wash her back. "You show off too."</p><p>"Yep." Akane and Ting Li shared a giggle. Akane opened the shower door and stepped out. She grabbed a towel and threw a second to Ting Li. She wrapped the towel around herself. "That was a present Ting Li."</p><p>Ting Li laughed. "Oh me know." She replied easily. "It very nice present." She walked over to Akane and looked into her eyes. "Maybe I earn present again one day," She leaned closer and gave Akane a peck on the lips. "But not very soon, yes?" She said. "It enough to know I welcome."</p><p>"Ukyo was a little worried, you know." Akane said quietly.</p><p>"She very good woman. I not try take her place." Ting Li finished drying herself and she and Akane walked out of the bathroom. Ting Li stopped in front of her bedroom door. "I think I get some sleep."</p><p>Akane smiled. "Sleep well Ting Li." Akane walked back into the other bedroom. "Okay you two, the shower is free." She said. "Ting Li went back to her room."</p><p>Ranma took Ukyo's hand and led her out of the bedroom. Akane sniffed the air. "Smells like a whore house in here." She grumbled. Akane opened a window to air the room and straightened the bed. By the time Ranma and Ukyo returned the room looked and smelled a lot better. Ukyo walked over to the futon and stared at it.</p><p>Akane looked at Ukyo. "You okay?"</p><p>"Was it that obvious?" Ukyo asked quietly.</p><p>"Even Ranma knew." Akane replied. She smiled at Ukyo's laugh. "That's better."</p><p>Ukyo found herself hugged by both Ranma and Akane. "You know no one can take your place Uk-chan." Akane said firmly. "She's cute but she's not you."</p><p>"What the Tomboy said." Ranma added. "Goes double for me."</p><p>When Ukyo woke the second time it was to the smell of something cooking. She gently untangled herself from the twin embraces of Ranma and Akane and made her way to the kitchen. Ting Li, with an apron over her pant suit, was busy making something. "Smells good." Ukyo said from the doorway.</p><p>"Good afternoon Ukyo." Ting Li said cheerfully. "You sit. I bring you tea." Ting Li pointed firmly at a chair. When Ukyo sat she brought a mug of tea over to the chef and returned to her cooking. "I hope you hungry." She said as she quickly stirred the food in the wok.</p><p>"Starving." Ukyo replied. She sipped her tea. Ukyo watched as Ting Li quickly, and to Ukyo's trained eyes, expertly stir fried a meal. "The guys are still asleep."</p><p>"Let sleep." Ting Li grabbed a plate and put some rice in the center and then scooped some of the stir fry over the rice. She placed the plate in front of Ukyo. "Eat." She ordered.</p><p>Ukyo chuckled. "Yes Mother." She picked up a pair of chopsticks and tasted the food. "Not bad." She said around a mouthful.</p><p>Ting Li smiled and made a plate for herself, then two more plates that she covered. She placed the two covered plates on the counter and carried her plate to the table. She sat down opposite Ukyo. "You know, you very good teacher." Ting Li said impishly. Her smile widened at Ukyo's bark of laughter. She leaned forward. "I not know how you do it." She said conspiratorilly.</p><p>"They are energetic aren't they?" Ukyo agreed.</p><p>Ting Li nodded rapidly. Her expression sobered. "I think maybe I not want do that again for long time." She said seriously. "And only if you say it okay."</p><p>"What if Ranma asks to sleep with you?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"I ask you first." Ting Li replied.</p><p>"What if it's Akane?" Ukyo asked with a wry smile.</p><p>"Then I defintely ask you first." Ting Li replied.</p><p>Ukyo's gave Ting Li a searching look. "And what if I ask?"</p><p>Ting Li smiled. "Ask and find out."</p><p>Akane and Ranma staggered into the kitchen to find Ukyo and Ting Li laughing. "What's so funny?" Akane asked. She and Ranma sat down and accepted a mug of tea. Ranma unconvered the plate in front of him and began eating.</p><p>"You two." Ukyo replied simply. "I was just telling Ting Li some of our adventures in high school." She looked at Ting Li. "Well now that they're awake, feel like going for a jog?"</p><p>"Sound good." TIng Li replied. "You two clean up." She ordered. 'We see you later." With a wave Ting Li and Ukyo left the kitchen.</p><p>Ranma and Akane looked at each other. "Gods I'm glad we don't have to do that again any time soon." Akane said feelingly. Ranma nodded emphatically in agreement. Akane smiled wryly. "If it were anyone else I don't think I'd believe them." Akane leaned over and gave Ranma a quick kiss. "I love you Ranma Saotome."</p><p>"I love you too Akane Tendo." Ranma replied.</p><p>"I don't know why." Akane replied honestly. "But I'm glad you do. Wanna go cuddle?"</p><p>Ranma looked into Akane's eyes. "Yeah, I do."</p><p>End Chapter 2</p><p>Author's Notes: Believe it or not, there is no lemon scene. It wasn't necessary and I never create a lemon unless it furthers the story in some way. Still it was fun to write.</p><p>Next up, we finally find out who was responsible for the pictures. Any guesses before I post?</p><p>Don't worry Howard Russel, the Terrible Three aren't getting tattoos, though I can't promise the same for two or three other characters.</p><p>Shout outs to: sergwish, dana-san, JohnnyG, gort420, dennisud, Jerry Unipeq, Wharpt (of course), Babs Yerunke, James Axelrad, Wonderbee31, Raver Styx and deitarion.</p>
