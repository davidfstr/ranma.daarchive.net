</div><p>Book 7 - Part 1</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Training Days</p><p>Pema walked along the street carrying a bag of groceries in her arms. At almost sixteen and after two years living with Ranma, Akane and Ukyo the young Tibetan girl was no longer painfully thin. Slim, yes, but it was a healthy slimness. One that spoke of good diet and regular exercise. Though still somewhat shy the young girl, now verging on womanhood , seemed to have a perpetual and contented smile on her pretty face. A smile that seemed to widen as her destination came into view. 'Home.' She thought happily. 'I'd better hurry.' She thought to herself. 'The gods will be home soon.' She giggled slightly. 'I can't believe Ranma ate a whole tub of ice cream by himself.'</p><p>Pema came to the intersection in front of the apartment and waited for the light to change. The light changed and Pema started across the street. She was half way across when a car barreled through the intersection and ran the light and headed right for Pema. Pema's mouth opened in fright and a scream barely had time to leave her throat when a triple blur landed in front of her. Pema felt herself scooped up in powerful arms and suddenly the street was far below her. The next thing Pema knew she was being placed on her feet on the roof.</p><p>"Are you alright, baby?" Akane's voice was full of concern. "Oof." Akane said as Pema hugged her hard.</p><p>"Pema okay, Tomboy?" Ranma's voice came from behind them. Ranma and Ukyo walked from the edge of the roof.</p><p>"She's fine." Akane hugged the Tibetan girl. "Just a little frightened." Akane said. "You get the driver?"</p><p>"No, damn it." Ukyo grumbled. "He just kept going."</p><p>Akane nodded and pushed Pema away to look at her. The young girl seemed on the verge of tears. "It's okay, baby, you're safe."</p><p>Pema nodded. "Pema sorry, Akane." Pema said in a tearful whisper.</p><p>"Sorry?" Akane said in surprise. "It wasn't your fault."</p><p>"But Pema doubted." Pema replied. "Pema should know you watch me." She said. "Please forgive." The tears began to fall.</p><p>"Oh baby, it's okay. Don't cry." Akane said in reassuring tones. Akane scooped the young girl up in her arms and carried her down the stairs and into the apartment. Ukyo picked up the discarded bag of groceries and followed. Ranma looked out over the street; a pensive look on his face. The pensive look changed to anger that he quickly suppressed.</p><p>"I'll get mad later." He told himself. With a last look at the streets below he turned and entered the apartment building.</p><p>When Ranma entered the apartment he found Ukyo in the kitchen. "Where's Pema and the Tomboy?" He asked.</p><p>"In Pema's bedroom." Ukyo replied. "Akane's going to stay with her for awhile." Ranma nodded and leaned against the kitchen counter. Ukyo gave Ranma an appraising glance. "You've got that 'someone is going to pay' look on your face." She commented.</p><p>"That's cause someone is." Ranma grumbled. "I don't think it was an accident." He said in cold tones, literally cold as the temperature in the kitchen dropped. "If we hadn't come back early..." Ranma began. He stopped. "She froze, Uk-chan."</p><p>"Speaking of freezing, you mind turning off the air conditioning?" Ukyo said. She waited until Ranma dropped out of the Soul of Ice. "Better." Ukyo said. She walked over to Ranma and placed an arm around his shoulders. "She's not a martial artist, Ran-chan." Ukyo reminded Ranma. "She's just a normal teen aged girl."</p><p>"Yeah, I know." Ranma replied. "She's never gonna be one either." He said more to himself than Ukyo. "But she can't keep relying on us to save her." Ranma shook his head. "No, she's got to be able to take care of herself. Even if it's only to run away." Ranma grabbed at his pigtail and looked at the ends. "If I'm right, they're going to try again."</p><p>"Even if they don't, it's a good idea." Ukyo said in agreement.</p><p>Akane helped the shaken Tibetan girl undress and get into a nightgown. Pema remained quiet throughout. It wasn't until Akane was placing the covers over her that Pema suddenly grasped Akane's hand. "Please Akane, stay with Pema."</p><p>Akane smiled slightly and nodded. "Sure Pema." She replied. "Let me just tell the guys, okay?" She said gently. Pema nodded and released Akane's hand. Akane paused at the door of the bedroom to look back at Pema. She smiled reassuringly and left the bedroom. Seeing no one in the main room, Akane headed into the kitchen. Ranma and Ukyo, sitting at the table and drinking tea, looked up as Akane entered.</p><p>"How is she, Tomboy?" Ranma said in concern.</p><p>"She's still a little shaken, but okay." Akane replied. There was a grim look on her face. "We can't be with her all the time." She said.</p><p>"Ran-chan was just saying the same thing." Ukyo commented. She sipped her tea. "She needs to be trained." Ukyo put the cup down. "But in what?" Ranma frowned and nodded.</p><p>"Well you two think about it." Akane replied. "I'm going to stay with Pema."</p><p>"You do that, Tomboy." Ranma said in approval. "She's staying with us tonight." He said firmly.</p><p>Ukyo made a noise of agreement. "I"ll make dinner anyway, maybe she'll be hungry later." She said.</p><p>"I'll try to convince her." Akane exchanged a smile with Ukyo. "Later guys." Ranma and Ukyo waved and Akane returned to the bedroom. "You still awake, baby?" Akane said quietly as she entered.</p><p>"Pema awake." Pema replied from the bed. "Not sleepy, just..." Pema shrugged.</p><p>"I know, baby." Akane said. She started removing her clothes. "Let me get out of these street clothes and then you and I will cuddle for awhile. Okay?" Akane said.</p><p>"That be very nice." Pema said. Akane quickly changed into a nightgown and got into the bed with Pema. Akane gathered the Tibetan girl into her arms. "It's okay baby." Akane said soothingly. "I got you." Pema nodded against Akane's chest. "Would you like to stay with us tonight?" Akane asked. Pema nodded again. Akane chuckled. "We should just move your stuff into our bedroom." Akane commented.</p><p>"Oh no, Akane." Pema protested. "Pema just be in way, Ranma need his womans and, and...," Pema looked up from the cradle of Akane's arms as Akane chuckled. "Akane?"</p><p>"Nothing, baby." Akane replied. "Well, there is that." Akane admitted. "But I'm sure we could work something out." Pema mumbled something. "What was that, baby?"</p><p>"Pema just say, Pema wish she were older." Pema said quietly. "Then maybe..." Pema broke off. "Akane?" Pema's voice trembled slightly. "Will it hurt?"</p><p>"Will what...oh." Akane stroked Pema's hair. "Don't be in such a hurry to grow up, baby." Akane said. "You have plenty of time."</p><p>"But Pema want grow up, want be woman." Pema said. "Want be Ranma woman." She whispered. "Like Akane." She said. "Like Ukyo."</p><p>"Been thinking about it a lot, haven't you?" Akane asked in quiet tones.</p><p>Pema nodded. "It what Pema here for, yes?" Pema said. "When Ranma rescue Pema, when you take Pema in, Pema knew then. Knew she belong Ranma. Pema know she not worthy." She said quietly. "Pema know she never be in Ranma heart, not like Akane, not like Ukyo. Pema only mortal. But maybe...maybe Pema give back little bit of what you give Pema."</p><p>"Oh Pema." Akane wiped at her eyes. "You give more than you know." she said. "You're still too young." Akane said a moment later. "I'm not promising anything but," Akane hugged Pema a little tighter. "Maybe."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma and Ukyo looked up as the door to the kitchen opened. Akane walked in. She had changed back into slacks and a blue blouse. "Hey Tomboy." Ranma said in greeting. "How's Pema?"</p><p>"She's fine, Ranma. She's taking a shower." Akane replied. "Mmm, that smells good." She said as the smells of Ukyo's cooking registered. "Sea Bass?" She asked. Ukyo nodded. "Pema's favorite."</p><p>"That's why I made it, sugar." Ukyo replied. "I figured it might make her feel better."</p><p>Akane walked over to Ukyo and kissed her on the cheek. "Thanks, Uk-chan." Akane said. "Hey Uk-chan, how old were you when you and Ranma did it that first time?"</p><p>Ukyo blinked in surprise, then blushed. "Sixteen years, two months and three days. On a Saturday night." She said. "But who's counting?" Ukyo quipped. "Why?" She shook her head. "Never mind, Pema?"</p><p>"Pema." Akane said.</p><p>"She's too young." Ranma said firmly.</p><p>"I know that, Ranma." Akane replied testily. "But.." Akane twiddled her fingers. "Maybe not too young to, um, play? Just a little?" She said in slightly embarrassed expression changed to something more knowing. "And don't tell me I'm the only one." She said in accusing yet playful tones. She gave a lopsided smile at the sheepish looks that appeared on Ranma and Ukyo's faces.</p><p>"Yeah, well..." Ranma began to protest and broke off. "Guilty."</p><p>"That makes three of us, sugar." Ukyo replied quietly. "What did you have in mind, sugar?" Ukyo asked in a louder voice. "Just out of curiosity."</p><p>"I don't know, but it has to be special." Akane replied earnestly. "It has to be something romantic."</p><p>"Candles, incense, that kind of thing?" Ranma asked. Akane nodded. Ranma smiled in approval. "Sounds nice." He said. "Just touching?" He asked.</p><p>Akane shrugged sheepishly. "Maybe a little bit more, but not a lot more." She amended firmly. "So, we're agreed?" Akane caught Ukyo's then Ranma's eyes. "We give Pema a night to remember." Ukyo and Ranma exchanged looks. They turned back to Akane and nodded.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Pema sat down at the dinner table. Still a little shaken by the events earlier she ate quietly despite the best efforts of Ranma, Akane and Ukyo. Still by the end of the dinner she was beginning to regain her smile. "That was very nice dinner, Ukyo." Pema said quietly. "Pema wish she cook like Ukyo."</p><p>"No one cooks like Uk-chan." Ranma said. "Right Tomboy?"</p><p>"Mhm." Akane said in agreement. She stood and started gathering dishes. "Why don't you and Pema go watch a movie or something?" Akane said. "Go on." Akane said. "Uk-chan and I got it."</p><p>Ranma grinned. "Let's go, Pema, before Akane changes her mind." His grin widened when Pema giggled. He took the Tibetan girl's hand and led her out of the kitchen. Ranma led Pema to the couch. "You decide, TV or movie." He told Pema.</p><p>"Pema not care." The Tibetan girl said. She leaned against Ranma. "What Ranma like, Pema like." She sighed happily when Ranma draped his arms across her shoulders. "Pema not care if we not watch anything, Pema just happy Ranma hold her."</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "You know, you sound more like the Tomboy and Uk-chan everyday." Ranma reached over with his other hand and lifted Pema's chin with a finger. "You're even as cute as them."</p><p>"Ranma teasing Pema." Pema complained. "Pema never be as pretty."</p><p>Ranma leaned over. "Take it from me, baby." Ranma said. "The only reason you're not beating the boys off with a stick right now is because they don't know where you live."</p><p>"Good." Pema replied. "Not want boys to know where Pema live." She declared. "Not want boys."</p><p>"Oh?" Ranma's voice was teasing. "Should I change into a girl?"</p><p>"Ranma!" Pema scolded. "You know that not what Pema mean." She stopped as Ranma started to chuckle. "Why you always tease Pema?" She said with a pout.</p><p>"It's a guy thing." Ranma replied. "I always tease the girls I like, just ask the Tomboy." He smiled. "And the more I like them, the more I tease them." He said. "And I tease you a lot." He chuckled as Pema thumped him in the chest with her tiny fist. "Yep, getting just like the Tomboy." He said. "Okay, okay I'll stop teasing you." He said. He pulled Pema closer. "Well if I can't tease you, I'll just have to do something else." To Pema's astonishment he leaned closer and kissed the young girl on the lips.</p><p>Pema pulled away and stared at Ranma. "Ra-Ranma?"</p><p>"Well that's the first time a girl did that." Ranma said in amusement. "Usually they like it when I kiss them."</p><p>"Is Ranma teasing Pema again?" Pema said in unsure tones. Ranma shook his head. "Ranma not teasing?" Ranma shook his head again. "Ranma really want kiss Pema?" Ranma nodded. "Pema not know how kiss." Pema said. "Ranma teach?" She asked hopefully. Ranma grinned and nodded. "Now?" Pema more demanded than asked.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Pucker up, baby." Ranma said. "Class is now in session." He put a hand behind Pema's head and pulled her face close to his. The kiss that followed surprised Pema in a gentleness that somehow conveyed a suppressed hunger. Pema shivered as Ranma's tongue caressed her lips and her own tongue met his almost instinctively. When Ranma broke the kiss, Pema's lips tried to follow.</p><p>"Ahh." Breathed Pema. "Again?" She whispered. The following kiss was still gentle though hungrier. Mostly on Pema's part. This time Pema broke the kiss and leaned her head against Ranma's chest. "I think Pema must be in heaven." Pema looked up. "Ranma?" She asked. "Does this mean Ranma make Pema his woman now?"</p><p>"Is that what you want, Pema?" Ranma asked. "You're still too young." Ranma said gently when Pema nodded. He raised an admonishing finger. "You're still too young." He repeated. A disappointed look appeared on Pema's face. Ranma smiled. "But the Tomboy thinks you're old enough to move the boundries a little." Ranma said. "A little." Ranma repeated. Pema squeaked in surprise when Ranma scooped her up in his arms. "I know you took a shower earlier." Ranma said. "But I didn't."</p><p>"Ranma?" Pema eyes widened.</p><p>"I need someone to wash my back." Ranma started walking toward the bathroom. "And you're elected."</p><p>"Really?" Pema's voice vibrated in excitement.</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "Really." Ranma carried Pema into the bathroom. The bathroom was large for an apartment it's size but Ranma thought it was worth the money. It had been custom designed to allow three people to share comfortably, four once Pema moved in. While Pema had slept with Ranma, Akane and Ukyo it had always been to cuddle and sleep. And never had Pema showered or bathed with Ranma when he was male.</p><p>Ranma slipped off his shirt and removed his cotton pants. He looked at Pema. "Are you planning to wash my back fully dressed?" He asked in amused tones. He walked over to Pema. "Here, let me help you." He started unbuttoning Pema's blouse. The young girl, almost woman, stared trustingly into Ranma's eyes and let him remove her blouse without resistance. It wasn't until she was stepping out of her skirt did she react. Pema blushed redly. "Do you want to stop?" Ranma asked gently.</p><p>Pema looked down and shook her head. "Pema..." Pema licked her lips then reached behind her and unhooked her bra. She lifted her head to look at Ranma. "Pema, not want to stop."</p><p>Ranma smiled approvingly. "Now remember, you're just washing my back." He reminded the Tibetan teen. He reached for his boxers to pull them down. "You can turn around if you want." Ranma said in light teasing tones. Pema shook her head so quickly she made herself dizzy. Ranma suppressed a laugh. He lowered his boxers. Pema's eyes widened in awe as Ranma's full assets came into view. Ranma turned and walked over to a stool that stood in the center of the shower. He sat. "Fill the bucket, Pema." Ranma said.</p><p>Pema shook herself and ran over to the stall and picked up a bucket. She hurried to a tap and turned the spigot. "Warm water." Ranma said. Pema nodded and adjusted the temperature. She filled the bucket with warm water and carried it to where Ranma was still seated. Pema placed the bucket next to Ranma. Ranma dipped a wash cloth in the water and started washing his arms. "My back, Pema." Ranma said in amused tones.</p><p>Pema stared at the broad expanse of Ranma's back before she dipped a sponge into the water. She squeezed some liquid bath soap onto the wet sponge and made a lather before applying the soapy sponge to Ranma's back. "A little lower." Ranma directed. "Ahh." He said when Pema washed the right spot. "Not bad, Pema." Ranma said after Pema had been washing his back for awhile. Pema rinsed the remaining suds off of Ranma's back. Pema stood and retrieved a towel and brought it over to Ranma. Ranma raised his arms. "Go ahead." Pema hesitated for a second then started drying Ranma off.</p><p>Pema used the towel to dry Ranma's back and arms. He turned and Pema dried Ranma's chest. Pema's movements slowed as she took her time. "Ranma so beautiful." Pema murmured Pema continued drying off Ranma. She knelt down and started to dry his legs. Pema swallowed nervously as she had her first close up view of Ranma's manhood. "Maybe you dry?" She said.</p><p>"No, go ahead." Ranma replied. "Gently." Pema nodded and began drying between Ranma's legs. Even thrugh the towel she could feel Ranma's shaft hardening slightly. "I think I'm dry enough." Ranma said eventually. "Stand up, Pema." Pema stood. Ranma took the damp towel from Pema's hands and hung it up. Then, with a fluid motion, scooped Pema into his arms. Without a word, Ranma carried Pema out of the bathroom and through the apartment. He stopped in front of the main bedroom door. "It's us." The door opened and Ranma carried Pema into the bedroom.</p><p>"Ahh." Pema breathed. The room was lit solely by dozens of candles. A delicate odor wafted through the air. Standing naked at the foot of the bed were Akane and Ukyo. Ranma carried Pema to the bed and placed her in the center of the bed. He got in the bed and gathered Pema in his arms. Akane and Ukyo followed, with Akane on Pema's other side and Ukyo behind Akane. Pema reached out and gently touched Akane's face. "Why you do this for Pema?" She said quietly.</p><p>"Because we love you, baby." Akane replied. She smiled. "There's just something about you."</p><p>"I think the Tomboy fell in love with you the day Ran-chan brought you home." Ukyo added. "I know I did."</p><p>"Truly, Ukyo?" Pema asked.</p><p>"Truly, sugar." Ukyo replied. "As the Tomboy said, there's something about you." She reached across Akane and stroked Pema's face. "Something that makes us want to make you happy." She smiled helplessly. "We like making you smile." Pema smiled. "Yeah, just like that." Ukyo said.</p><p>"Oh Pema not know how she could be happier." Pema gushed. She wiggled against Ranma. Pema giggled suddenly. "I think Ranma needs his womans again."</p><p>"Really?" Akane asked in a sly tone. "Hmm, we can't have that." She said. "Now can we Uk-chan?"</p><p>"Nope." Ukyo replied. "What do you think we should do, Pema?"</p><p>"What Pema think?" Pema's eyes widened. "Ranma say he not make me his woman tonight." Pema said slowly. "Ranma say Pema too young."</p><p>"You are." Akane said. She smiled at Pema to take the sting out of her words. "But." Akane paused. "Okay, here are the rules. Rule number one, you ask." She said seriously. "Rule number two, you don't hide what your're doing."</p><p>"Ask?" Hide?" Pema said. "Pema not understand."</p><p>"Akane asked permission for you to be here. Like this." Ranma said. "We all agreed."</p><p>"Only way it can work, sugar." Ukyo added. "Say, for example, I want to sleep just with Ranma." Ukyo said. "I ask both of them; I ask Ranma if he wants to sleep with me and I ask Akane if it's okay if she sleeps on the couch." Ukyo grinned when Akane snorted in amusement.</p><p>"So, if Pema want sleep with Ranma." Pema blushed. "Pema ask everyone?" Pema thought about it for a moment. She nodded. "Pema think it good rule."</p><p>"Now rule number three applies only to you." Akane again smiled as she said it. "You, baby, are still too young for real sex." She reached over and stroked Pema's face. "But we think you're old enough for some of the," Akane's smile widened. "The basics."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Lemon section</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema woke in the middle of the night. Her head pillowed on Ranma's chest, and the rest of her intertwined with the limbs of Akane and Ukyo. A faint blush came to her face as she remembered the events of earlier in the evening. To Pema, it was magical. She had been fondled, caressed and kissed by, not just Ranma, but Akane and Ukyo and she had kissed, caressed and fondled them in return. However, to Pema's disappointment, and some relief, that's as far as it went. Pema was still a virgin and it appeared she was going to remain one for some time to come. Regardless, Pema knew she belonged. She sighed happily closed her eyes and went back to sleep.</p><p>Author's Notes: Yeah there's a lemon and yeah it really bites when I excise it from the story. Especially when the lemon is nearly as long as the chapter. Not really necessary for the story really but I thought it was kind of sweet in it's own way.</p>
