</div><p>Chapter 11</p><p>"Getting girls off the street'</p><p>Kodachi was sitting at her desk in her office at the club. Noriko was standing just behind her as the two of them were going over the financial figures for the month. "It looks like we're going to need a couple more girls." Noriko pointed at a figure. "And not just here. All the clubs." She shook her head. "Especially the lower end clubs." She said. "I know you wanted to close them down, but that's where we're getting the bulk of our revenue."</p><p>Kodachi sighed and nodded. "I had hoped..."</p><p>"Not everyone can afford a Miki or a Rei, you know." Noriko pointed out. "Or even an Ami and you know how little she charges." She said. "At least in comparison to the rest of the girls."</p><p>"I know. I know." Kodachi replied. "But..."</p><p>"No buts, Dachi." Noriko replied. "We've got to cater to the working man too, you know." She shrugged. "There's more of them after all. And they need lovin' too." Noriko put a hand on Kodachi's shoulder. "Look Dachi, you're giving them a safe place, well a safer place, to work. " Noriko said. Kodachi nodded reluctantly. "And they know they have you and Nabs to complain to if things go wrong, right?" Kodachi nodded again. "So, okay, they don't get taken to Onsens or a fine restaurant, but they're making a living and more importantly living to enjoy it."</p><p>Kodachi sighed. "I suppose you're right." She admitted. "And we are getting girls off the street."</p><p>"Exactly." Noriko looked up at a knock on the door. "Yes?"</p><p>The door opened and Fumie stuck her head in. "A...visitor for Ms. Kuno." Fumie looked over her shoulder for a moment. "She said you know her. Chinese woman with purple hair."</p><p>Kodachi sat back in her chair. "Shampoo." She said in resigned tones.</p><p>"You mean that's really her name?" Fumie rolled her eyes. "Send her in?" She asked. Kodachi nodded. Fumie pulled her head out and then the door opened wider. "Ms. Kuno will see you now." She said. Fumie stepped away and Shampoo, dressed in a purple leather jacket and matching leather pants, entered the room.</p><p>"Ribbon girl." Shampoo chirped. "It be too long."</p><p>"Hello Shampoo." Kodachi replied. "And it's Kodachi." She indicated Noriko. "This is my aide and companion, Noriko Mata." She said in introduction. "Noriko, this is Shampoo, one of my more dangerous acquaintances." She looked at Shampoo. "Why are you here Shampoo?"</p><p>"Why everyone act like they not happy to see Shampoo?" Shampoo complained. "Shampoo not feel wanted." She grinned. "I here because Ranma say so. Shampoo staying in town. Need job." She said. "Ranma say you may have job."</p><p>There was another knock on the door. "Yes?" Noriko said.</p><p>The door opened and Fumie stuck her head back in. "Excuse me Ms. Mata, Ms. Kuno." She nodded toward Shampoo. "I'm getting inquiries."</p><p>"Indeed?" Kodachi said. "Any offers?"</p><p>Fumie walked into the office and placed two envelopes on Kodachi's desk. "Two, Ms. Kuno, both very high rollers." Fumie gave Shampoo a questioning look. "Is that your natural hair color?" She asked. Shampoo smiled and nodded. "Thanks, they asked." Fumie turned back to Kodachi. "What do I tell them?"</p><p>"Tell them...negotiations are underway." Kodachi replied. "Thank you, Fumie." Fumie nodded and exited the office. Kodachi looked at the envelopes for a moment then opened one. Kodachi's eyebrow raised. "Interesting." She opened the second envelope. "Most interesting." Kodachi looked up to see Shampoo smirking at her.</p><p>"They looking for dates?" Shampoo asked in amusement. Kodachi nodded. "How much they think Shampoo worth?" She asked. Kodachi pushed the envelopes across the desk. Shampoo sashayed over and picked up an envelope. She smiled. "Not bad. Not enough, but not bad." Shampoo sat down in a chair. "But that not kind job Shampoo looking for."</p><p>"I didn't think you were." Kodachi replied. "Still, these are two of my bigger clients. I'd hate to disappoint them." Kodachi smiled. "I have a club, another club, it needs a manager and some cleaning up." She explained. "It also is the center of some territory that could be profitable if it too were cleaned up." Kodachi leaned back in her chair. "I was thinking of putting one of my senior girls in charge but, to be honest, I really can't spare any of them."</p><p>Shampoo crossed her legs. "How big territory?" She asked in interested tones. "And what wrong with club?"</p><p>"Big enough." Noriko said crisply "It's a mixed use area; residential, small businesses, a good number of bars, couple night clubs." Noriko smiled. "Not including yours, of course."</p><p>"Of course." Shampoo agreed. "And my club?" She asked with a smile.</p><p>"The previous manager was associated with Tokio Wasuhara." Noriko replied. "You weren't here for that; let's just say the girls were working harder than they should have."</p><p>"How many girls, I have?" Shampoo asked.</p><p>Noriko opened a folder. "Five." She replied. "If you need more, you'll have to find them yourself." She held the folder out to Shampoo. "I think most of what you need to know will be found in here. Anything else, ask."</p><p>"One thing." Kodachi said. "Or rather several things but it's really one thing; The Ice Queen's rules are to be obeyed." She said. "No drugs, except Marijuana. No guns." She raised a hand as Shampoo made to object. "Nabiki is not foolish enough to leave your people helpless, but you personally do not need weapons, you are a weapon."</p><p>"Shampoo weapon?" Shampoo said innocently.</p><p>"Please do not treat me like a fool, Shampoo." Kodachi said tiredly. "Your bimbo act may fool some but not me, and certainly not Lady Kuno." She said. "The Ice Queen will not countenance any form of weapons trafficking other than traditional weapons. Swords, knives, fine, guns..." Kodachi snorted. "If anyone is foolish enough to break that rule, they will find the Ice Queen ...unforgiving." Kodachi said firmly. Shampoo looked sour but nodded. "And finally, the Pema rule."</p><p>"Ah, Ranma's little pet." Shampoo said in amusement. "What Pema rule?"</p><p>"Sex slavery and trafficking is more than forbidden, we are actively against it." Noriko said 'The Ice Queen will not have any more Pemas. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who breaks that rule will find the Ice Queen more than unforgiving. Assuming there's anything left of the rule breaker if Ranma gets to them first..." Noriko smiled coldly. "Or us, the Ice Queen will personally feed what's left of the rule breaker to the sharks."</p><p>"I thought it was 'swim with the fishies'." Shampoo said in amusement.</p><p>"The Ice Queen does not indulge in metaphor." Kodachi said in her own amused tones.</p><p>Shampoo raised an eyebrow. "Shampoo see." She said slowly. "Mercenary girl have grown." Shampoo shrugged. "Not problem. There plenty girls who be willing."</p><p>"True." Admitted Kodachi. "You will also ensure that your girls see a doctor regularly, keep them off hard drugs and, where appropriate, get them out of the business."</p><p>"Ribbon girl joke." Shampoo protested.</p><p>"No joke, Shampoo." Kodachi replied. "Ice Queen's rules." She said. "You either follow them or go back to Hokkaido."</p><p>Shampoo rolled her eyes. "Lots trouble over whores." She complained. "Oh well, at least it not be boring." Shampoo leaned forward and picked up the two discarded bid envelopes. "High rollers, yes?"</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "There are rooms on the second floor, if you need one." Kodachi raised her veil. "Very nice rooms, if I do say so myself." She said proudly. "The house gets ten thousand yen for use of the rooms."</p><p>"Must be very nice rooms." Shampoo said in amusement. "What, is toilet made of gold?"</p><p>"Gold plated." Noriko admitted. "But no one really looks close enough to tell the difference."</p><p>Shampoo laughed.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was raining as Kagomi ran from her grandfather's store to the open door of the waiting limo. A liveried retainer held an umbrella in front of the door to protect Kagomi as she got into the rear passenger compartment. "Hi Pema." She said. She and Pema exchanged a quick kiss. "Hey, shrimp." Kagomi said to Kiko.</p><p>"Hey Kagomi." Kiko replied. "missed you."</p><p>"Missed you too, shrimp." Kagomi said. It had been nearly a month since the car incident and the first time Kagomi was returning to the mansion. "Heck, I even miss Madame Demille."</p><p>"You're right Pema." Kiko said. "She hit her head harder than we thought." The three girls giggled. Kiko smirked. "We'll see how much you miss her by the end of the weekend." Kiko said. "Madame Demille told us to tell you that your vacation is over and it's time to get back to work."</p><p>"Madame Demille say no such thing." Pema said tartly. "She say, time for Kagomi stop being so lazy." She said with a smile.</p><p>"Hey, now you're both ganging up on me." Kagomi complained. She pouted for a moment then broke into giggles. "Damn, I really did miss you guys." Kagomi all but bounced in the car seat. "So, what's the plan for this weekend; other than Madame Demille, that is?"</p><p>"Oh we have big, big plans for weekend." Pema said. "Ms. Kuno say if Madame Demille happy with us, we all go to club."</p><p>"Club?" Kagomi said in excitement. "As in THE Club? Ms. Kuno's club?"</p><p>"That the one." Pema replied.</p><p>"Oh wow." Kagomi breathed. "Really?"</p><p>"Really." Pema replied. She wagged a finger at Kagomi. "But only if Madame Demille happy." She warned. "With all of us."</p><p>"Okay, okay." Kagomi said hurriedly. "I'll be good." She promised. "Heck, for a chance to go to the club, I'll be a living angel." Kagomi squealed in excitement. "The club." She said excitedly. "Do you think Raven will sing?" She asked. "Please tell me she's going to sing."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kagomi and Pema finished unpacking. They were in the same room they had before, the one Kagomi claimed was bigger than the apartment she shared with her grandfather. She may have exagerated but not by a lot. All the suites in the Kuno mansion were large and well appointed and this one was no exception. Once unpacked the two teenaged girls sat on Pema's bed. "Okay, give." Kagomi said. "You've been biting your lips ever since I got in the car." She said. "Something happened." Suddenly Kagomi's eyes widened. "You didn't." Pema nodded. "Really?" Pema nodded again. Kagomi licked her lips. "Did it...did it hurt?"</p><p>Pema shook her head and sighed happily. "Ranma and Akane were oh, so gentle." She said. "Ranma take time, so Pema get used to feeling." She giggled. "Pema don't think she ever get used to feeling. Pema feel so, so...full." She said.</p><p>Kagomi nodded. "I bet." She said in slightly jealous tones. Then Kagomi frowned as Pema's words sank in. "Wait a minute, Ranma AND Akane?" She asked.</p><p>Pema giggled. "Oh that right, Kagomi not know." Pema leaned closer to Kagomi. "Akane have magic potion, make Akane man." She said in a confiding whisper. She giggled quietly. "Big man." Pema said. "Ukyo say, good thing Pema there or Ukyo be only woman." She giggled. "Again."</p><p>Kagomi's mouth dropped open. "You mean, Akane...you and Akane...you and Ranma..." Kagomi stammered. "Really?"</p><p>"Really." Pema raised a finger. "Now, if Kagomi be good girl maybe, just maybe, Pema ask so Kagomi find out what it like." Pema placed an arm around Kagomi's shoulders. "Would Kagomi like that?" Pema asked in a teasing tone. Kagomi looked down and nodded. "Good." Said Pema. "Kagomi, Pema bestest friend and bestest friends share everything."</p><p>Kagomi looked up. "Yeah?" She asked. "Who says?"</p><p>"Akane says." Pema replied. "Akane, Ukyo and Ranma bestest friends. Share everything." She said. "Share home, share food." Pema giggled. "Share Pema." Pema said. "Pema think one day they share Kagomi too." Pema giggled again. "But only if Kagomi be good girl." She said.</p><p>"Yeah?" Kagomi said again. "And what do I have to do to be a..." Kagomi made air quotes with her fingers. "Good girl?"</p><p>Pema giggled. "Pema thought Kagomi never ask." She gently pulled Kagomi closer to her and it took little prompting before the two of them were locked into a hungry kiss. "Missed you." Pema whispered when they broke the kiss.</p><p>"Missed you too." Kagomi whispered back.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Well look who's here." Nabiki said in sour tones. "Hello Sis." She said in reluctant greeting. "Ukyo." She greeted the brown haired martial artist. "Where's Ranma?"</p><p>"On the roof." Akane replied. "Standing guard." She frowned. "Well, aren't you going to invite us in?"</p><p>Nabiki hesitated. "Standing guard?"</p><p>"Both your ex-boyfriend and the old ghoul may be back in town or at least getting active again." Akane replied. "In?" Akane asked pointedly. Nabiki nodded somewhat reluctantly. "What with you, sis?" Akane asked as they entered the penthouse.</p><p>"Pema." Nabiki replied. "Come on guys, she's fifteen for pity sakes." Nabiki said angrily.</p><p>"Sixteen next week." Akane replied. She leveled a finger at Nabiki. "I thought we settled this. I told you. Ranma told you." Akane walked into the main part of the penthouse and immediately went to the wet bar and started making drinks.</p><p>"I've told you." Ukyo chimed in. "And Pema's told you. She's happy. We're happy. No one's getting hurt. End of story." Ukyo said. "Just a short one, sugar." She said to Akane.</p><p>"Besides, you've got bigger things to worry about than who we're fucking." Akane said. "Ice, ice...oh here it is." She said. "Where's Kuno? Where's Kimi?"</p><p>"Lover is...oh crap." Nabiki rolled her eyes. "Is Ranma male or female?"</p><p>"Male." Akane grinned. "Relax." Akane said. "The worst that could happen is they both get a good workout." Akane's grin got wider. "Unless there's something about Kuno you haven't told us." Akane said in false sweetness.</p><p>"Anyone ever tell you, you can be a complete bitch?" Nabiki asked in conversational tones.</p><p>"Yeah, me." Ukyo said in cheerful tones. "She's had some good teachers." Ukyo gave Nabiki a smile that could only be described as icy. "Right?"</p><p>Nabiki chuckled. "Guilty as charged." Nabiki said. Nabiki's face became immobile. "Do you really think it's them?" She asked in her best Ice Queen tones. "I have a half dozen Yakusa lords claiming they don't know who it is."</p><p>"Maybe they don't." Ukyo said reasonably.</p><p>"Maybe." Nabiki replied. "Hang on." Nabiki walked over to a door, opened it and stuck her head in. "You awake?" She said. There was a barely audible response. Nabiki chuckled. "You may be tired, but lover is on the roof, working out." There was a sound almost like a shriek. "Not my fault." Nabiki said. "Now get up and come out here, we got problems." Nabiki closed the door. "Kimi'll be out in a minute or so." Nabiki smiled ruefully at the knowing chuckles coming from Akane and Ukyo. "I drink bourbon." Nabiki said to Akane. "Neat."</p><p>"Ooh, tough girl." Ukyo said in admiration.</p><p>Akane handed Nabiki her drink. "What did you expect; she's a Tendo." Akane said proudly. "What should I make for Kimi?"</p><p>"I'll share Nabs' drink." Kimi said from the doorway of the bedroom. She walked into the room wearing a pale yellow silk robe. It was obvious that was all she was wearing. Kimi walked barefoot over to a settee and lay down. Nabiki walked over and sat down next to Kimi. Nabiki handed the drink to Kimi. "What's the story?" Kimi said after she took a healthy sip.</p><p>"HIkaru and the old ghoul." Nabiki replied. "Maybe." She rubbed the bridge of her nose. "And this information came from where exactly?"</p><p>Akane and Ukyo exchanged looks. "Shampoo told us about Cologne, we figured out the rest." Akane replied. "She hasn't visited you yet?" Akane asked. Nabiki shook her head. "Well don't blame us, we told her to speak to you."</p><p>"Which is probably why she's delaying." Kimi said. "I suspect we'll hear from her in another day or two."</p><p>"I suspect we'll hear from her in about ten minutes." Nabiki predicted. "Mercenary girl." Chirped a familiar voice. "Or less." Nabiki turned and put a smile on her face. "Hello Shampoo."</p><p>"Shampoo not stay long." Shampoo said. "You know about Great Grandmother and second Airen?" She asked. Nabiki nodded. "Good." Shampoo looked at Akane. "Shampoo have what pervert girl drinking." She said snorted and started making a drink. "Shampoo decide follow Ranma suggestion and work for Ribbon Girl."</p><p>Akane walked over to Shampoo with her drink. It was her stripper walk. "I bet." Akane handed Shampoo her drink. "The two of you always did get along." Akane leaned her face close to Shampoo's. "What's your game, Shampoo?"</p><p>"Game?" Shampoo said in innocent tones. "Shampoo tell you truth, Shampoo bored." She said. "Shampoo never bored here."</p><p>"She's got a point." Nabiki said. "Kodachi gave you that club? She asked. Shampoo nodded. "She explain the rules?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Too much trouble for whores." Shampoo grumped. "No worry, Shampoo follow rules." She said in resigned tones. "What next? Day care?"</p><p>"Any girl who needs day care, you send to me." Nabiki said. "I'll find her something else to do."</p><p>"In the meantime, you get that territory cleaned up." Kimi chimed in. "Tokio was a pig in more ways than one." She said. "His clubs sold watered down booze. His girls were over worked. And he was charging too much in protection." She said briskly. "So you're going to have an uphill battle to get them to to trust you."</p><p>"Yeah. Yeah." Shampoo said dismissively. She downed her drink. "Mercenary girls not worry. Shampoo know what to do." Shampoo stood. "Shampoo go now." She said. "Much to do. Shampoo be in touch." Shampoo skipped to a window and jumped out.</p><p>"Would it be too much to hope she just killed herself?" Kimi grumbled. Kimi sighed. "Hikaru's back, huh?"</p><p>"Maybe." Ukyo replied. "Probably." She amended a moment later.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma evaded another sword thrust from Tatewaki. "Admit it." Ranma said. He backflipped over the next sword strike. "Even though you know me and the pig-tailed girl are one and the same, you're still turned on by her." Ranma ducked under the sweeping blade then captured the blade between his palms. "Come on, admit it. I turn ya on."</p><p>Tatewaki lashed out with a leg forcing Ranma to jump back. "She does." Tatewaki snapped. "You don't."</p><p>"Same difference." Ranma laughed. Ranma made kissing sounds at Tatewaki. "Come on, you know you want it."</p><p>"I always knew you were a pervert." Tatewaki raised his blade into an attack position. "And you've only become worse."</p><p>"Look who's talking." Ranma turned his back on Tatewaki and wiggled his rear. Ranma looked over his shoulder and grinned. "Come and get it." He sang. "No?" Ranma said. "Oh, I know what's wrong, you're a bottom." Ranma grinned. "I'll be gentle." Ranma's grin widened as Tatewaki's attacks started coming faster.</p><p>"Knave." Growled Tatewaki. "Poltroon."</p><p>"Hey no fair using words I don't know." Ranma complained.</p><p>"That would be most of them." Tatewaki shot back.</p><p>"Ooh, that was almost funny." Ranma replied. He flipped and spun to evade the sword strikes of the enraged swordsman. Ranma jumped into the air, landed on Tatewaki's shoulders and then jumped again. Ranma landed on his hands and started running on his hands across the roof top. Ranma passed Tatewaki's gym bag and grabbed a water bottle, flipped on to his feet and upended the bottle. Ranma blurred and shrank and where there once was a tall and powerfully built young man there was now a short, buxom redhead. "Hi honey." Ranma sang in her soprano. "I'm back."</p><p>Despite seeing the change and knowing Ranma was the redhead, Tatewaki hesitated long enough for Ranma to get past his defenses. The tall swordsman suddenly found the redhead pressed against him. "B-back foul fiend." Tatewaki jumped backwards when he felt the redhead's hand reaching between his legs. "Not funny." He growled.</p><p>"You see me laughing?" Ranma giggled. "Okay, that was a laugh." Ranma put a pout on her face. "You don't love me anymore." Ranma said sadly. "And after all we've meant to each other." Ranma strode, panther like, toward Tatewaki. "How about we kiss and make up?" Ranma puckered her backed away. His sword raised in guard before him. "No?" Ranma asked. Ranma raised her hands. "Okay, okay, I'll be good." Ranma grinned evilly. "Though I'm told I'm a lot more fun when I'm bad."</p><p>"Ranma." Growled Tatewaki.</p><p>"Oh chill, Tatewaki baby, I'm just kidding around, though if you..." Ranma broke off as Tatewaki began to growl. "Kidding, just kidding." She said. "Good workout, by the way." She said. "I'm glad to see you're still in shape." Ranma said in suddenly serious tones. "Nakamura is back."</p><p>"What?" Exclaimed Tatewaki angrily. "When? How?" He demanded. "I thought Shampoo took away his memories?"</p><p>"She did." Ranma replied. "He got them back." Ranma shrugged. "We think."</p><p>"You think?" Tatewaki's voice dripped sarcasm. "Disregarding the obvious fallacy in that statement, what do you mean, you think?"</p><p>"We haven't checked it out yet." Ranma said reasonably. "Actually, I was going to ask if you wanted to tag along." Ranma grinned at the questioning look in Tatewaki's face. "We think." Ranma said in emphasis. "That Hikaru is playing possum and pretending to be weakened but is actually sneaking out at night and rebuilding his organization." She reached behind and grabbed her pigtail. "Just like Akane and I did when we were in prison." Ranma shrugged. "He's more than good enough to do that."</p><p>"And if it is Nakamura?" Tatewaki snarled. "What then?"</p><p>"You tell me." Ranma said. "Someone has already taken two shots at Pema. I'm not planning on letting whoever it is take another."</p><p>Tatewaki was silent for a moment then with a graceful sheathing of his sword turned and strode toward the stairwell. "We must consult my Ladies." He said without turnng around.</p><p>Ranma grinned and followed. "Nab's is right. You are getting smarter." She said.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"And stand, two three. amd walk, two three." Madame Demille intoned. "Miss Akahito, what is so interesting on the floor?" She demanded.</p><p>"Nothing, Madame Demille." Kagomi replied in resigned tones.</p><p>"Exactly." Madame Demille said. "Head up, Miss Akahito, head up." She instructed. "And smile." Kagomi plastered a false smile on her face. "No. No. No." She complained. "Are you trying to be annoying., Miss Akahito?"</p><p>"No Madame Demille." Kagomi replied. "It's, It's...oh forget it." Kagomi suddenly sat down on the floor. "What's the use?" She said in self-loathing. "I'll never get it."</p><p>"You will stand up right now, Miss Akahito." Madame Demille said sharply. "A lady does not sit on the floor."</p><p>"A lady?" Kagomi gave a bitter laugh. "Who's supposed to believe I'm a lady?"</p><p>"You are." Madame Demille said firmly. Madame Demille walked over and knelt down next to Kagomi. "You, Miss Akahito, are a lady." The deportment teacher said in surprisingly gentle tones. "You only need to believe in yourself, Miss Akahito." She said. "Your friends do." The deportment teacher lifted Kagomi's chin with a finger. "And I do." She said. "Now, what did I say about ladies and floors?"</p><p>Kagomi gave the deportment teacher a wry smile. "That they, I mean we, do not sit on them." The deportment teacher nodded in approving agreement. Kagomi got to her feet. "Sorry, Madame Demille."</p><p>"You are quite forgiven, Miss Akahito." The deportment teacher replied. "Now let's try that from the beginning shall we?" She said. "Places everyone." She ordered. Kagomi, Pema and Kiko sat down at the dining room table. "Now remember, a lady..." Madame Demille looked at Kagomi. "Holds her head high at all times." She said. "She does not slouch." She gave Kiko a look. "Or fidget." She told the three girls. "Or look at the floor."</p><p>"Yes, Madame Demille." Chorused the three girls.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Four figures leaped over the wall that surrounded the correctional facility. They landed against the inside wall and, keeping to the shadows, made their way toward the main building. They halted at the base of the building and then, in seeming defiance of gravity, the four figures effortlessly scaled the sheer sides of the building. Once on the roof the four fanned out. They seemed to be searching for something.</p><p>"Here." One voice called quietly. The other three gathered around.</p><p>"Good work, Tomboy." Ranma said in a near whisper. "Remember, down the air vents, into the generator room and then up one level to solitary." He said. "And keep it quiet." Ranma said. "We get caught, we'll have a lot of 'splaining' to do." Ranma grinned. "Just like old times, hey guys?"</p><p>"Just like, Ran-chan." Ukyo said cheerfully. "Ready?"</p><p>"Ready." Akane and Ranma chorused. "Kuno?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Aye." Tatewaki Kuno said somberly. "Though I still don't understand why we are doing it this way." He grumbled. "We could have just gone through the regular channels, instead of sneaking in."</p><p>"A hunch." Ranma replied. "If I'm right, we would have learned nothing. If I'm wrong..." Ranma shrugged. "Okay, let's go."</p><p>Several minutes later the four were quietly creeping through the ventalation system of the high security prison. Unlike the one Ranma and Akane had been in, which despite the nature of some of the inmates, was a mid-level security prison, this one was designed to deal with the more violent and dangerous segment of the criminal population. And as violent as the general prison population was, there were those even too violent for them. This was where they were headed.</p><p>Like rats creeping through their burrows, the four continued silently through the metal shafts. They finally reached the generator room. "Now careful." Ranma cautioned. "There are cameras everywhere." He said to Tatewaki. "Do what we do, when we do it." Ranma opened the door to the corridor. The corridor was dimly lit but bright enough for Ranma to make out two cameras making a covering sweep of the corridor. Ranma counted under his breath then jumped to ceiling and crept upside down along the ceiling. Ranma reached the first camera and fiddled with the housing for a second before moving on to the second camera.</p><p>"The cameras are not moving." Tatewaki rumbled. "They're going to notice." He said.</p><p>"It's temporary." Akane replied. "Now shut up and follow." She said. Akane raced down the corridor hugging the left side. Ukyo followed. After a moment Tatewaki followed as well. Tatewaki stopped at the end of the corridor and looked back. True to Akane's words the cameras were starting to move again. "This way." Hissed Akane. Tatewaki shrugged and followed. Several corridors and a stairwell later the four found themselves standing in front of a steel door.</p><p>"Now what?" Tatewaki whispered. "The doors are locked."</p><p>"Watch." Akane replied. Akane placed her hands against the door. There was a bluish glow and then Tatewaki saw frost start to form on the door. Akane removed her hands and then hit the door with the flat of her hand. There was a click and the door popped open. Akane opened the door wider and the four entered the room. a form could be seen sleeping on a narrow cot along one wall of the narrow cell.</p><p>"Looks like you were wrong, Ran-chan." Ukyo whispered in disappointment. "He's here."</p><p>"Yeah?" Ranma strode over to the sleeping form and pulled it over. Ranma's hand slapped down on the figures mouth. "Shut up and you'll live to complain about it." Ranma hissed. "Wrong, huh?" He said. "Take a look."</p><p>Tatewaki leaned forward. "That's not Nakamura." He growled.</p><p>End Chapter 11</p>
