</div><p>Chapter 5</p><p>'It's one of them'</p><p>Nabiki leaned back in her chair. An iced drink pressed against her chin. Her eyes were closed. Except for the occasional sip of the drink she seemed carved from stone. Kimi was seated at a nearby desk working on her computer. "It's one of them." Nabiki said finally. She sat up. "Someone thinks I've gotten complacent."</p><p>"Or thinks they're too important to you for you to interfere." Kimi replied. "Or both." She added. "probably, both."</p><p>"Probably." Nabiki agreed with a nod. "The question is; who?" She pointed out. "Tokio, Nerumi, Oyabun Honda, heck it could even be Genji Morimoto." Nabiki hesitated. "Okay, not Genji Morimoto."</p><p>"Probably not Kinnikun Honda either." Kimi said. Then she grinned. "Or if it is, he'd better have his insurance all paid up." Nabiki snorted in agreement. "I'll check anyway." Kimi added.</p><p>"You do that." Nabiki said."In the meantime, what do we know about the girl?"</p><p>"Not a lot." Kimi replied. "There is a record for a Pema Tenzin that fits her description but it also says she's dead." Kimi said reading the screen. "Hmm, the date of death is less than a month ago." Kimi called up a browser window and ran a query. Then another and then another. She finally went to a site and read silently for awhile. "Yeah, I thought that's what I remembered." Kimi said sourly. "Some families will sell a girl into prostitution or slavery and then declare the girl dead." Kimi's voice vibrated with anger. "Just so the family won't be dishonored." Kimi spat the words. She took a deep breath to calm herself. "Met a couple girls from there." Kimi's voice became sad. "Addicts. Both of them."</p><p>Nabiki sat her chair up and stood. She walked over to Kimi and put her hands on the blonde woman's shoulders comfortingly. Then her grip tightened not painfully but firmly and with resolve. "Not on our watch, partner." Kimi turned her head to look up at Nabiki and Nabiki smiled down at Kimi. "Isn't that right, My Lady Kimi?"</p><p>"Absolutely, My Lady Nabiki." Kimi smiled. "Hey, I think I'm getting used to it." She said cheerfully.</p><p>"As you should, My Lady." Tatewaki's voice rumbled from the doorway. He was dressed in his usual swordsman's outfit. It fit him well. Tatewaki entered the office. His entrance the glide of the accomplished swordsman. "It suits you." Tatewaki walked to a bar and poured himself a glass of water. "I have news." He intoned. Tatewaki drank from his glass.</p><p>"The boy sure does have a flair for the dramatic." Kimi said to Nabiki. Nabiki snorted in agreement. "You found the buyer." Kimi guessed.</p><p>"Nay." Tatewaki admitted. "But I did find the transporter." Tatewaki said grimly. "Pirates." Tatewaki said. His mouth twitched slightly. "Captain Osigi has been hearing stories about one pirate captain in particular." Tatewaki said. "One story has it that he once tangled with the Ice Queen and survived." Tatewaki chuckled. "Apparently his reputation did not suffer from such an admission."</p><p>Nabiki's faced firmed into near immobility as she listened to Tatewaki. "Kimi." Nabiki said in icy tones. "Do you happen to remember the name of the captain of the first ship we captured?"</p><p>"To be honest, No." Kimi replied. "But I bet Ting Li does."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Dou Gan Shou." Ting Li said in angry tones. "I can't believe he live." Ting Li paced back and forth. Even angry her motions were fluid and controled. Her time in Japan and her growing wealth did little to change the orange haired Joketsuzoku warrior, other than to make her even more beautiful. She was in great demand as a model and her face and figure were becoming more and more well known throughout Japan. "That mistake I soon correct." She snarled. Ting Li stopped pacing and took a deep breath. "How girl?" She asked when she was under better control.</p><p>"Doc Ono says she'll be fine." Kimi replied. "Which is more than Dou Gan Shou will be able to say when we find him." She said in cold tones.</p><p>"And we will find him." Nabiki vowed. She looked around the apartment with approval. A large apartment by Japanese standards it was situated on the top floor of a ten story building in a very fashionable part of Nerima. "Where's Konatsu and Ryoga?" She asked.</p><p>Ting Li rolled her eyes. "Who knows?" She said. "Last I saw, Konatsu chasing Ryoga across rooftops." Ting Li rolled her eyes again. "They have another fight." She said in exasperation. "They both such children sometime."</p><p>"What is it this time?" Nabiki asked in amusement.</p><p>"Oh just usual silliness." Ting Li barked a laugh. "They kiss and make up soon." Her laughter was joined by those of Kimi and Nabiki. Ting Li sobered quickly. "No worry, we be ready."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Good."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight, I'm your host, Saatchi Kato." The reported looked down at some papers as a image appeared on the screen behind her. "Ryoga Hibiki." She said. "Powerful, handsome, popular with the ladies. Undefeated in every street fight and legitimate ring fight. A man's man." A picture of an orange haired and beautiful woman appeared on the screen. "He has been frequently seen with super model Ting Li." The picture was replaced with another of an equally beautiful woman. "And just a frequently with the notorious transvestite, Konatsu Kanzen." She said.</p><p>The reporter swiveled her chair toward another camera. "Rumors have circulated around the three of them for months." She said as an image of the three appeared behind them. "Tonight's topic: Who is Ryoga really seeing? We'll have some interviews with those who know him best." She smiled. "After we come back."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ryoga landed heavily on the next roof. The distance had been a little more than he was used to, plus he was getting tired. "Aw come on Natsu, give it a break." The burly martial artist yelled over his shoulder. Ryoga evaded another thrown pepper bomb. He sneezed as it exploded less than five meters away. "Achoo."</p><p>"Don't call me Natsu." Konatsu said angrily. "Only my friends call me that." The Kunoichi tossed another pepper bomb. "Right now you're not my friend." Though male, Konatsu had the appearance and mannerisms of a very pretty young woman. Trained as a female ninja by his parents and raised in a brothel by his step-mother, Konatsu was also one of the premier martial artists in Japan. "Why do you have to be so selfish?" Konatsu asked plaintively as he tossed a large number of Shurikens at the dodging Ryoga.</p><p>"Let's not start that again." Ryoga complained. Ryoga stopped in the middle of the rooftop and braced for Konatsu's next attack. 'He's gotta be outta weapons by now.' He thought. Despite his complaints, Ryoga was actually happy about fighting Konatsu. 'Good thing Natsu is as good a fighter as Ranma or I'd have no one to spar against.' He told himself. 'Gotta stay in shape.' Ryoga shifted his stance. "I'm not sucking your cock." He declared.</p><p>"Why not?" Konatsu took his own stance. "You fuck me." He pointed out angrily.</p><p>"Yeah but only from behind." Ryoga shot back. "That way I can pretend you're really a girl." Ryoga raised his hands. 'Here it comes.' He thought in anticipation.</p><p>"Grrr." Growled Konatsu and attacked in a blur of punches and kicks. Ryoga blocked rapidly and responded with his own counter attack. Forcing Konatsu to block and retreat. The battle between the two martial artists raged on and on and sweat began to pour down the faces of both of them. Fortunately for Konatsu his Kunoichi garb was designed to absorb the sweat and prevent if from getting into his eyes. Ryoga's bandana did the same until Konatsu ripped it off his head. Ryoga suddenly found himself blinking away the sweat to keep it from obscuring his vision. A sudden blow from Konatsu while Ryoga was distracted had the burly martial artist on his back on the roof. Konatsu leaped and landed astride Ryoga and pinned him to the roof. Konatsu looked down at Ryoga angrily then the expression on his pretty face fell. "Why do you have to be so mean?" He said sadly. "Don't I give you everything you want?"</p><p>"Aw c'mon, Natsu." Ryoga replied. "It's bad enough that I fuck you." He waved his hands in front of him as Konatsu raised a fist. "I gotta rep to maintain, you know." He said.</p><p>"Who's going to know?" Konatsu pointed out with a pout.</p><p>"In this town?" Ryoga said incredulously. "With Gos on the loose?" Ryoga gave Konatsu a dirty look. "How many people did you show the last vid to?" He asked sourly.</p><p>"I only showed them a little bit." Konatsu said innocently. "And only to my closest friends." Konatsu laid his head on Ryoga's chest. He smiled triumphantly when Ryoga put his arms around him. "Oh, okay, I suppose I'm not mad at you anymore." Konatsu said.</p><p>"Good." Ryoga grunted. "Cause I'm hungry and I'm horny." He declared. "Food first." He decided. Ryoga sat up and without letting go of Konatsu flowed to his feet. Ryoga put Konatsu on his feet. "Let's go home." He said.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma untangled himself from the twin embraces of Akane and Ukyo. Ranma threw on a robe and opened the door of the bedroom. He stopped. Sleeping in a ball at the door was Pema. The young Tibetan girl, they had learned she was fourteen, was curled up in a nest of blankets. Her eyes suddenly snapped open. Pema struggled to her knees and placed her head on the floor. "Pema?" Ranma knelt down and tapped the girl on her shoulder. He made a rising motion with his hands. The young girl rose to her feet but she kept her eyes on the floor.</p><p>Pema had been living with Ranma, Akane and Ukyo for a little over a week. Ranma insisted and Akane and Ukyo were vocal in support of the idea. The first couple days, Pema had done little more than, eat, sleep and, with help from one of the three, go to the bathroom. To their satisfaction Pema grew stronger each day. Still, there had been some bad nights and, again, one of the three would stay up with her. If you had asked any of them why they wanted to take care of the young girl instead of putting her in a hospital, none of the three really had a good answer. Honor, duty, responsibility all were given as reasons and, possibly, it was all of it. And possibly, probably, something else. Something more. All they really knew was that they felt protective about her.</p><p>The last two nights had been relatively calm. Pema slept both nights in some comfort and she no longer needed help getting around. "It was malnutrition more than the drugs that was hurting her." Was Ono's assessment. "And not just from her captivity." He had said. "Her family was living marginally at best for a long time."</p><p>Ranma examined the young girl standing trembling before him. She was still pale but her face was regaining some of it's color. He put a comforting hand on her shoulder and smiled reassuringly when she looked up. Ranma guided Pema to the kitchen. Pema's eyes lit up when she realized what the room was for. She looked at Ranma. "Might as well teach you how to make something to eat." Ranma said to Pema. He walked over to the rice cooker and waved Pema over. "Watch." He said. Ranma showed Pema how to plug in the cooker and how to make rice with it. Pema looked at the rice cooker with awe.</p><p>The rice going, Ranma then proceeded to make breakfast. He took out some vegatables. Pema pointed at the knife and then at herself. Pema mimed her chopping the vegetables. "You wanna help?" Ranma asked. He held out the knife. He put some vegetables in front of Pema.</p><p>When Akane and Ukyo staggered into the kitchen, they found Ranma sitting at the table sipping some tea and Pema assembling breakfast dishes. The young girl was singing quietly as they entered.</p><p>Pema looked up as Akane and Ukyo entered. She made to kneel down on the floor. "Pema." Ranma said sharply but softly. The young girl looked at Ranma. Ranma shook his head and mimed a bow. Pema nodded and bowed to Akane and Ukyo. Then the girl hurried over with plates and put them down. "She wanted to help." Ranma said as the girls sat down. "Don't worry, I didn't let her do anything hard." He nodded toward Pema who was back at the counter. "Tough kid." He said approvingly. "Pema." Ranma called. He pointed to the table. "Sit." Pema shook her head an almost frightened look appeared on her face.</p><p>Akane and Ukyo waved their hands as well. "Come on, sugar." Ukyo said. She smiled and nodded. "It's okay." Akane patted the seat. Pema hesitantly walked over. With a little more coaxing she sat down though she kept her head down as she ate. "Poor thing." Akane said in sympathy. "According to Ting Li." Akane said. "Even if we could get her home, it wouldn't do any good." She said. "As far as her family is concerned; she's dead."</p><p>"Yeah." Echoed Ukyo and Ranma sadly.</p><p>"So, what do we do?" Ranma asked. "She wouldn't last ten minutes on her own."</p><p>"She needs to be with someone who'll take care of her properly." Ukyo said. "I'd say us but," She waved a hand to emcompass the apartment. Pema looked up nervously and Ukyo made a reassuring motion. "I don't think we're the right role models."</p><p>"Uk-chan's got a point." Ranma conceded reluctantly. "But I don't want to, you know, just dump her off somewhere." He looked at Pema. The young Tibetan girl has finished her breakfast and was sitting quietly with her head down. Ranma's face firmed. "I just don't."</p><p>"We don't either." Akane said. She placed her hand over Ranma's. "Whatever you want, Ranma." She said. "Is what we want." Akane squeezed Ranma's hand. "Hey, what about Daddy?" She said. "Since Kasumi moved out, he's been rattling around in the big house all by himself."</p><p>"Except when Pops shows up." Ranma said sourly. He shrugged. "On the other hand your dad is a really nice guy." Ranma began to nod. "It might work." Ranma nodded again. "Let me think about it but it sounds like a plan."</p><p>"I think it will be good for both of them." Akane said. "Daddy needs to feel needed." Akane looked at Pema. The young Tibetan girl was still looking down. "Pema." Akane said in friendly tones. "Still hungry?" She asked in Cantonese. The young girl shook her head. Instead she stood up quickly and collected the dishes and brought them to the sink and started washing them.</p><p>"I think she's trying to be useful." Ukyo guessed. "Probably afraid we'll kick her out."</p><p>When Pema finished the dishes she stood in the middle of the kitchen with her head down. "Pema." Ukyo stood and took the young Tibetan girl by the arm. "Bath." She said. "Hey Akane, you think you got something she could wear? She's close to your size."</p><p>"Maybe some sweats." Akane replied. "She's awful thin." She waved her hand. "Get her washed up." She said. "Then I think we'll go shopping."</p><p>"Shopping?" Ranma perked up. "Hey great idea, I need a new outfit." Ranma watched as Ukyo took Pema out of the kitchen. "Poor thing." Ranma said.</p><p>"Yeah." Agreed Akane.</p><p>Akane was sorting through some old clothing when Ukyo and Pema, both wrapped in towels, walked into the bedroom. Ranma looked up. "My turn." He said. "I'll make it quick." He smiled at Pema as he walked out.</p><p>Between Ukyo and Akane they got Pema dressed and the two martial artists grimaced at the sight of Pema's naked body. They had given her a sponge bath while she was sick but seeing her all at once was a shock. 'You can see her hip bones." Ukyo said quietly. Ukyo handed Pema some underwear, panties and a t-shirt. "Here." Pema looked at the underwear, shrugged and put them on. It wasn't until Akane started bringing out blouses that a flicker of interest appeared on the Tibetan girl's face. When Akane pulled out a blouse of vibrant blue, Pema made a sound, almost a mewl, and her hands reached out before she dropped them at her sides.</p><p>"The blue one, huh?" Akane said. "Girl's got some taste." She said. Akane held out the blouse and nodded.</p><p>Pema almost grabbed the blouse. She looked at Akane who nodded again. Pema's face lit up with a shy smile as she took the blouse. She held the fabric against her cheek for a moment before she put it on. Akane found a pair of faded jeans that Pema was able to wear with a sash instead of a belt. Akane shook her head. "Maybe the sweats are better." She said doubtfully. Akane looked up at a knock at the bedroom door. "It's me." Came Ranma's voice. Akane noted how Pema looked eagerly toward the door. 'There goes the Saotome magic again.' Akane thought in amusement. "Come in Ranma." Akane called.</p><p>The door opened and Ranma with a towel wrapped around his waist walked in. He held a glass in one hand. Pema's eyes widened when she saw Ranma's half naked and muscular body. She quickly looked down, though Akane could see the young girl peeking. Akane suppressed a giggle. "Can't help showing off, can you Ranma?" Akane said. "Be careful Ranma, you may have another fiance to deal with."</p><p>"No thanks." Ranma replied with a exagerated shudder. "The one I got is more than enough." He said looking at Akane. "Besides, she's only a kid." Ranma beckoned to Pema. "Pema, don't be afraid." He said in Cantonese. "Watch." He raised the glass and poured it over his shoulders. Pema bit back a scream when Ranma changed in front of her. "It's okay, it's still me." Ranma said in her female voice.</p><p>"R-ranma?" Pema said nervously. "You girl?" She looked at Akane. "Ranma girl?"</p><p>Akane nodded. "Ranma girl. Ranma boy." She said in Cantonese. "Magic."</p><p>"Magic?" Pema asked. She walked over to Ranma and hesitantly reached out with a hand to touch Ranma. "Real." She decided. Pema looked closely at Ranma. "Same eyes." She said.</p><p>"Observant, isn't she?" Ukyo said to Akane. "Most people don't notice Ranma's eyes that quickly."</p><p>"Most people don't look at Ranma's face that quickly." Akane retorted. "In either form." She snorted in amusement. "Okay, my turn for the shower." Akane walked out of the bedroom. A smile appeared on her face. 'So, he thinks of me as his fiance.' Akane thought. 'Again.' Akane quickly showered, returned to the bedroom and dressed quickly. Ranma, Ukyo and Pema got to their feet as Akane entered the main room. "Ready guys?"</p><p>"Ready." Chorused Ranma and Ukyo. "Cab or rooftops?" Asked Ranma.</p><p>Akane laughed. "You just want to show off." She accused playfully. "Rooftops." She said. "Cabs are too slow." She and Ranma exchanged grins. "Let's go." Akane said.</p><p>"You got it, Tomboy." Ranma replied. Pema squeaked in surprise when Ranma scooped the Tibetan girl up in her arms. Ukyo got the door and Ranma carried a confused Pema out of the apartment and to the roof. "Relax." Ranma said in Cantonese to Pema. Pema shrieked when Ranma jumped off the roof and buried her face against Ranma's chest. Once she realized she wasn't going to die, Pema lifted her head and she pouted angrily at Ranma. Her anger quickly disappeared and was replaced with exhilaration as she began to enjoy the unusual mode of transportation. Despite herself a giggle of delight escaped from Pema's lips.</p><p>Pema looked around and her eyes widened when she realized that Akane was pacing her and Ranma easily. She looked for Ukyo and saw the brown haired woman sliding along a nearby telephone line on top of what looked like a giant spatula. Pema could hear the brown haired woman's squeals of delight as she rode the telephone lines. 'They're gods.' Pema thought in wonder.</p><p>"Having fun, Pema?" Ranma asked. Pema nodded rapidly. "Good." Ranma said in satisfaction.</p><p>Ukyo guided her spatula along the telephone line. At the next pole she flipped, kicked off the telephone pole and landed next to Akane. Ukyo quickly matched Akane's stride."Want me to move out?" She asked conversationally.</p><p>"You heard that, huh?" Akane asked. Ukyo nodded. "Nah." Akane replied. "Kind of got used to you being there." Akane turned her head and grinned. "Besides, Ranma isn't the only one who thinks you're fun in bed."</p><p>"Yeah?" Ukyo found she was blushing.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane said firmly. "When it's time, we'll all know."</p><p>"And it ain't time, huh?" Ukyo asked,</p><p>"Nope." Agreed Akane.</p><p>"Cool." Ukyo grinned.</p><p>From the cradle of Ranma's arms, Pema looked around with great interest as they bounced along the rooftops. She still wasn't sure what these gods intended with her but she had decided that she owed them her life so it was theirs to do as they wished anyway. What she was sure of was that they were going out of their way to make her comfortable and feel secure. It was a heady feeling being a favorite of a god and she was determined not to disappoint them. She leaned comfortably against Ranma's chest. Pema suppressed a giggle. ' They may be gods, but they're vain gods.' She thought. Pema shrieked again, but this time in delight, as Ranma performed a forward flip and somersaulted over and over into empty space. As Pema trustingly expected they landed softly on the street below. Ranma placed the young girl on her feet.</p><p>"We're here." Ranma said. She waved her hand. Pema turned to see a store front. Pema's mouth opened in awe. The store window was filled with mannequins wearing skirts and dresses and blouses. All manner of accessories were displayed. Handbags, shoes and things that Pema could not identify but she thought was just too cute for words. Taped discretely in the lower corner of the window was a flyer for the Kabuki .</p><p>"It heaven." Pema breathed.</p><p>"Yep." Ranma agreed. "Mama Takai's House of Fashion." Ranma grinned. "The best Itabashi has to offer." She took Pema's hand. Ranma looked over her shoulder to Akane and Ukyo. "Ready guys?"</p><p>"Ready." Akane and Ukyo chorused. Akane and Ukyo linked arms and followed Ranma and Pema into the store. No sooner did they enter then there was a shriek of joy. An ample middle aged woman rushed toward the front of the store. "Usagi." The woman exclaimed. "Aoi, Sugoi." The woman embraced Ranma, then Akane and Ukyo and gave and received kisses on the cheek. "How are my favorite girls?"</p><p>"Hi Mama." Ranma greeted the woman warmly. "Miss us?"</p><p>"Of course I did." Mana Takai replied. "It's been weeks." She took a step back. "And who are you?" She asked Pema.</p><p>"She doesn't speak Japanese, Mama. Not a lot anyway." Ranma explained. "Mostly some Cantonese." Ranma turned to Pema. "Pema this is Mama." She said in Cantonese. Pema bowed. "She needs something to wear."</p><p>"Indeed she does." Mama Takai said. "She's much too skinny." Mama said critically. She smiled at Pema reassuringly. "Come. Come." She waved her hand.</p><p>Ranma gave Pema a little push. "Go with Mama." She said.</p><p>With a backward look Pema followed Mama to a rack of clothes. Ranma watched her walk away with a pensive look on her face. "She can't be the only one." Ranma said. Her face seemed to lose all expression and the air took on a chill. "I want him." She said. "I want the buyer."</p><p>"We'll find him, Ranma." Akane said. "And when we do there wont be enough left of him to bury." She promised.</p><p>"Uk-chan?" Ranma asked quietly.</p><p>Ukyo rotated her shoulder. The one that had taken a bullet. "Just try keeping me away." She said. "Where you guys go, I go."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Good."</p><p>End Chapter 5</p>
