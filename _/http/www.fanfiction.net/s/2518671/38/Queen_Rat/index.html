</div><p>'Belle of the Ball'</p><p>Kodachi walked into the suite of giggling and hurrying women. She clapped her hands. "Girls. Girls." She said. The women immediately quieted down. "That's better." She said. "Now remember, you're here to serve drinks and make conversation. Nothing else." She smiled. "The word is discrete." There were some mumbles that sounded like 'Yes Ms. Kuno.'. Kodachi nodded. "But don't forget to give out business cards whenever possible." She added. The response was more enthusiastic.</p><p>The door to the suite opened and Nodoka and Koko Kobiashi walked in. It was obvious that Koko was nervous but the enthusiastic greetings from the other women put her quickly at ease. "Are you sure you want me to do their hair?" Koko asked Kodachi.</p><p>To Kodachi's ears the protest rang false. 'She would give her right arm to do this.' Kodachi thought in amusement. 'Not that I blame her, the publicity alone.' Kodachi smiled behind her veil. "Please Koko." Kodachi said. "There is no one else I would trust."</p><p>"Well, if you're sure." Koko replied. She took a deep breath and within minnutes was busy working on the first of the women.</p><p>Kodachi looked around in bittersweet satisfaction. 'You should be here Ky.' She thought. 'I think you'd appreciate it.' Kodachi gave one more look around before she walked out of the suite. 'Auntie can handle anything that may go wrong.' Kodachi walked down the hallway until she reached the suite occupied by her brother, Nabiki and Kimi. She knocked.</p><p>Kimi opened the door. She was dressed in a light robe. "Ms. Kuno." Kimi greeted the gymnast. The greeting, while not friendly, was courteous. Even respectful.</p><p>"Lady Ota." Kodachi replied. She essayed a slight smile then frowned when she realized her veil hid the smile. She raised her veil and tried again. "May I come in?" She asked. Kimi stepped back and waved Kodachi in. "Thank you." Kodachi said.</p><p>Kimi walked with Kodachi toward a conversation pit. "Please." Kimi said. Her hand indicated the couch and Kodachi sat. "Drink?"</p><p>"I'm dying for one." Admitted Kodachi. "But I'll have to decline. To much left to do."</p><p>A sad smile came to Kimi's face at Kodachi's words. "I bet." Kimi regarded the woman in front of her. 'I'd tell her to relax but I think that's the last thing she wants.' Kimi thought. "Speaking of which; how goes the battle?" She asked in a light tone.</p><p>Kodachi smiled slightly. "Battle indeed." She replied. "I think I will be able to keep the castle from being overrun but," Kodachi shrugged. "Just barely." Kodachi heaved a sigh. "I find it helps, being busy."</p><p>Kimi looked down for a moment. 'Damn but I really want to hate her but,' Kimi looked at the veiled woman. 'How can I?' Kimi nodded.</p><p>The door to the bedroom opened and Nabiki, also dressed in a robe, walked out. "Who was at the, oh." Nabiki gave Kodachi a short though respectful bow. "Ms. Kuno." Nabiki walked over to the couch and sat down next to Kodachi. She gave Kodachi a long look. Then she gave a short approving nod. "You'll do." She said firmly. Kodachi leaned back against the couch. "You're a surprising woman, Kodachi Kuno." Nabiki said. She raised her hand to accept a drink from Kimi. Kimi sat down next to Nabiki with her own drink.</p><p>"Surprising?" Kodachi asked. A slight smile came to her lips. "Is that a good or bad trait?"</p><p>"In this case, a good one." Nabiki said.</p><p>"Careful Ice Queen." Kodachi chided. "That almost sounded like a compliment." Kodachi sighed. "Thank you." She said quietly. "So are you." Nabiki raised her drink in salute. Kodachi waved an aimless hand. "It's hard enough," Kodachi looked down for a second then looked up. "Lady," Kodachi hesitated. "Lady Kuno."</p><p>"We're not married yet Ms. Kuno." Nabiki replied in a soft voice.</p><p>"You will be." Kodachi replied. "That is certain." Kodachi straightened slightly. "Lady Kuno you are."</p><p>"And Kimi?" Nabiki asked in the same soft voice.</p><p>Kodachi looked at Kimi. "I hope, one day, you will permit me to call you sister." Kodachi said earnestly. "I hope, even more, that you would one day do the same." Kodachi looked at her hands that were now clasped in her lap. "For Ky's sake if not my own." Kodachi looked up when she felt a hand on her shoulder. She looked up into Kimi's eyes.</p><p>"Not just for Ky's sake." Kimi said. "How about if we start over?" She put out her hand. "Hi I'm Kimi."</p><p>Kodachi looked at the hand and grasped it firmly. "Hi Kimi, I'm Kodachi." She said. "Want to be friends?"</p><p>"I'd like that Kodachi." Kimi said. "I think I'd like that, a lot."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Stupid shirt." Growled Ryoga as he failed once again to button the collar button of his frilled tuxedo shirt."Why do I have to wear this monkey suit anyway?" He grumbled.<p>"Oh stop complain." Ting Li said in an amused voice. "It look good on you." She said approvingly. "Show off ass."</p><p>"That's what I like about it." Konatsu said prettily.</p><p>Ryoga rolled his eyes. "You never stop do you Konatsu?" He asked in amusement.</p><p>"Nope." Konatsu chirped. "Besides you love the attention."</p><p>Ting Li nodded in cheerful agreement. "That true." She walked over to Ryoga. "Let me." She reached up and button the top button. "There. Now tie." She reached over to the dresser and picked up the tie. "There going be cameras." She said as she expertly tied the bowtie around Ryoga's neck. "So smile wide." She said sternly. "And no hitting."</p><p>"Why don't we just jump over the," Ryoga began.</p><p>"No!" Ting Li and Konatsu shouted in unison. "It's not everyday a girl gets this kind of attention." Konatsu explained in a loud voice. "Right." Ting Li shouted in agreement.</p><p>Ryoga clapped his hands over his ears. "Ow. Okay. Okay." He shouted back. "Jeez." He complained. "It was just a thought." He winced at the twin glares coming from Ting Li and Konatsu. Ryoga quickly put on his jacket. "Okay, let's go."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Why so pensive My Ladies?" Tatewaki asked. He had just returned to the suite.<p>"Your sister was just here." Nabiki said. "We made up."</p><p>"Aye?" Tatekwaki asked. "Methinks that would constitute good news."</p><p>Nabiki spread her hand in a shrug. "It does." Nabiki admitted. "I just wish it hadn't come at such a high price." Nabiki blew out a breath. "We feel so bad for her." Kimi nodded sadly in agreement.</p><p>Tatewaki nodded. "Aye." Tatewaki walked over to the wet bar and poured himself a drink. He took a generous swallow. Tatewaki swirled the ice in the glass for a second. "She is Kuno." He declared quietly. "She will go on." Tatewaki looked at the door of the suite. "Yet, I worry."</p><p>Nabiki rose from her seat and walked over to Tatewaki and wrapped her arms around him from behind. "I know baby. We worry too." She said. "But her family will be there for her. Always."</p><p>"Thank you My lady." Tatewaki said gravely.</p><p>Kimi looked at Tatewaki and Nabiki. 'Damn they're good together.' She thought in satisfaction. 'One day it'll just be the two of them.' She smiled fondly at Nabiki and Tatewaki. 'But not yet and not now.' Kimi stood. "I hate to break you two up but we need to get ready." She said in more cheerful tones. "Especially you lover. Go shave and take a quick shower." She ordered.</p><p>A smile came to Tatewaki's face. "Aye My Lady." Tatewaki said. "At once My Lady." Tatewaki started to back away from Kimi and toward the bedroom door. His smile broadened. "Want to wash my back?" He asked. He ducked a thrown pillow. "I guess not." He laughed. Tatewaki turned and walked into the bedroom.</p><p>"I think we're spoiling that man Nabs." Kimi mocked grumped. Kimi smiled in satisfaction when Nabiki laughed. 'Good, we were all too serious.' She thought. "Speaking of getting ready." Kimi continued. "We better start now if we want to be fashionably late." Kimi's smile became a grin as Nabiki laughed again.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"How's my makeup?' Ranma asked anxiously. He looked into the mirror of the small compact he carried.<p>Akane and Ukyo looked at each other and grinned. "You look fine." Akane said reassuringly. "That shade of eyeshadow is perfect."</p><p>"Yeah?" Ranma checked himself one more time in the mirror. "I hope so." Ranma sighed. "How long do you think I should remain a guy?" He asked. "Assuming I don't get splashed, that is."</p><p>"At least through dinner." Akane said firmly. "You promised."</p><p>"And no splashing yourself on purpose." Ukyo added. "oh stop pouting. It's not like you have to be a guy the entire evening."</p><p>"I know. I know." Ranma replied testily. "But it's such a cute dress." He smiled ruefully at Akane and Ukyo's giggles. "Well it is."</p><p>Akane walked over to Ranma and tapped him on the nose with her finger. "Yes it is and you're going to have plenty of attention when you wear it." She promised playfully. "But you still are going as a guy."</p><p>Ranma sighed again. "Yes Tomboy." He opened the compact again and examined his image critically. "It is a nice shade." Ranma closed the compact with a snap. "You guys almost ready to go?"</p><p>"Just about Ran-chan." Ukyo twirled around making the skirt of the dress flair out. She grinned at the wolf whistles that came from both Ranma and Akane. "You guys." She half protested.</p><p>"What do you expect Uk-chan?" Akane said with a slight leer. "You do have great legs."</p><p>"The best." Agreed Ranma cheerfully. His smile fell. "I just put my foot in my mouth, didn't I?"</p><p>"Only halfway." Akane giggled. "At least you realize when you do it now." Akane sighed happily. "Besides, I agree with you." She said. "You'd have to be blind not to." Akane leaned against Ranma. "Come here Uk-chan." She crooked a finger. Ukyo skipped over and was pulled into a three way hug. "You are one special lady, Ukyo Kuonji." Akane said. "I'm proud to be your friend."</p><p>"You're going to make my mascara run." Ukyo threatened with a smile. "Me too, Akane, me too." She thumped Ranma's flat stomach with the palm of her hand. "Better be nice to her Ran-chan or I'll take her away from you."</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Now that's a threat I can believe." He said.</p><p>"Good." Ukyo chuckled. She looked at Akane. "That goes for you too."</p><p>Akane laughed. "So what else is new?" She wiggled happily. "Don't ever change Uk-chan, okay?"</p><p>"You got is sugar." Ukyo stepped back. "Okay let's make this a party no one will ever forget."</p><p>"Right." Chorused Ranma and Akane.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"This is Sachi Kato reporting from the Kuno Mansion." The pretty young woman said into the camera. Her features were replaced by a slow pan of the brightly lit Kuno Mansion. Limosine after limosine were busy pulling up the long gravel path to the front of the mansion. A large bank of camera and recording equipment filled one section. A long red carpet led from the curb to and up the steps of the mansion. . The image returned to the newcaster and pulled back showing she was standing next to a velvet rope that seperated her from the red carpet. There seemed to be hundreds of people lined up alongside the velvet rope. "As you can see the Kuno's have allowed the public on the grounds to see who has been invited."<p>She turned as a limo pulled up. A Kuno retainer in feudal area costume opened the door. The first of three people stepped out. "Omigods." She squealed. "It's Konatsu Kanzen." She said excitedly. "Omigods." She squealed again as a slightly self conscious Ryoga Hibiki stepped out. He reached in and took the hand of the third person. "It looks like at least some of the rumors are true." She said. "Konatsu Kanzen, the infamous transvestite and toast of Tokyo society, has been rumored to be seen with Japan's premier street fighter, Ryoga Hibiki and it looks like it's true." She reported into the camera. "The presence of the mysterious Ting Li is an added bonus." She said. "Rumors are flying about the woman that half the clothing designers in Japan are trying to talk to." There was a closeup of the orange haired warrior as she posed for the cameras. "Let's see if we can get a comment."</p><p>The reporter turned and stretched out her microphone to Ting Li. "Ms. Ting Li, Sachi Kato, Japan Today." She said in introduction. "There are so many rumors about you. Is there anything you wish to tell your growing number of fans."</p><p>Ting Li giggled. She waved to the camera. "Hi." She said. "Ting Li love being in Japans, being in Tokyo. Everyone be ever so nice to me." She posed as a camera flashed. She looked at the newreporter. "What fans want know?" She asked.</p><p>"Anything." The reported all but yelled. "You've been seen in the company of some of the most well known, famous and," She nodded toward where Konatsu was talking to another reporter. "infamous people in Tokyo. You've been invited to the hottest event in Japan. Why? Who are you? What's your relationship with Ms. Kanzen and Mr. Hibiki."</p><p>Ting Li smiled coyly. "You ask them." She said. "Ting Li will say she proud to know Ice Queen and very happy she friends with Konatsu and Ryoga."</p><p>"Friends?" Pounced the reporter. "What kind of friends?"</p><p>Ting Li giggled. "Good friends." Then she waved a finger at the reporter. "And that all you need know."</p><p>The reported swallowed a question and asked another instead. "Well can you tell us why you haven't signed with any of the modeling agencies? You must know they're dying to talk to you."</p><p>"Ting Li not sure she want be model." Ting Li replied.</p><p>"Oh you have to girlfriend." Konatsu said as he walked over. He wore an evening dress that showed off a lot of leg and somehow a lot of clevage that he didn't have. "Hi." He said to the newscaster.</p><p>"Ms. Kanzen." Exclaimed the reporter.</p><p>"Call me Konatsu. I love your show by the way." He batted his eyes at the reporter then blew a kiss at the camera.</p><p>"Call me Sachi please." The reported gushed. "Thank you. Maybe we could get you, all of you, on the show one day." She asked hopefully.</p><p>"Oh I'd love to sugar." Konatsu purred. "Give me a call, we'll talk." Konatsu smiled. "Ah here comes Ryoga."</p><p>The reporter's eyes widened. "Mr. H-hibiki." She stammered as Ryoga's imposing bulk approached. "My gods." She breathed. "He's magnificient."</p><p>"Wipe your mouth girlfriend." Konatsu teased the reporter.</p><p>The reporter blushed. "Mr. Hibiki. Care to say something to the television audience?"</p><p>"No." Rumbled Ryoga.</p><p>"You'll have to excuse Ryoga." Konatsu said. "He's the strong silent type." Ting Li nodded cheerfully in agreement. "Between you and me." Konatsu said in a stage whisper. "It's not his brains we're interested in." Ting Li nodded even more vigorously.</p><p>"Konatsu. Ting Li." Rumbled Ryoga warningly. "You promised."</p><p>Konatsu laughed and took Ryoga's arm. Ting Li took the other. "Well we must go in. Bye." He sang.</p><p>The reporter blinked and the three walked off. She stared after them for a moment than turned to the camera. She swallowed then smiled at the camera. "Wow." She said. "The beautiful people are out tonight." There was a sudden cheer from some onlookers. The reporter turned. "Omigods." She squealed. "It's the Terrible Three."</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo walked along the red carpet. "Ya gotta hand it to your sister." Ranma remarked. "She doesn't do anything halfway." The three stopped as the paparrazzi started taking pictures and posed.</p><p>"Nope." Akane agreed cheerfully. The three walked maybe five feet before they stopped again for more pictures. She noticed a reporter waving frantically. "Hey I know her." She walked over. "Ms Kato, isn't it?" Akane said. "I love your show."</p><p>The reporter beamed happily. 'Two endorsements in one night.' She thought. Visions of salary renegotiations danced through her head. "Thank you Ms. Tendo." The reporter replied. She looked around. "Isn't your cousin attending?" She asked. "Her fans were looking forward to seeing her."</p><p>"Told ya." Ranma said sourly.</p><p>"Ranko had a prior committment and will be showing up later." Akane said. She elbowed Ranma in the ribs. "After dinner in fact." She told the reporter.</p><p>"Too late then." Muttered Ranma.</p><p>"I see Mr. Saotome shares her fan's disappointment." The reporter commented."That's surprising considering the rumored feud between you and Ranko Tendo." She pushed the microphone into Ranma's face. "Get a closeup." She hissed out of the side of her mouth.</p><p>"Feud?" Ranma asked in surprise. The camera had panned in on Ranma's face. His blue eyes, though open, seemed to convey a sense of icy calm.</p><p>"Well yes, except for one or two times, You and Ranko have never been seen together." The reporter may have been a entertainment reporter but she was still a reporter and her nose smelled news. "You have to admit a feud make's a lot more sense then the silly rumor the two of you are the same person."</p><p>"Don't you dare." Akane and Ukyo chorused in threatening tones. Akane turned to the reporter. "There is no feud between Ranma and Ranko; in fact they're very close."</p><p>"Duh." Ranma said.</p><p>"Oh?" The reporter pounced. "Ranma has added another to his harem?" She gave Ranma a smoldering look. "And you don't seem to mind." She said to Akane. "What is his secret?" She purred.</p><p>Akane and Ukyo traded looks. "What makes you think it's Ranma that Ranko is interested in?" Akane purred back. She gave the reporter her own lingering look. "You ain't too bad yourself." Akane said in approval.</p><p>The reporter backed up. "Well it was really nice talking to you." She said hurriedly. She turned to the camera. "Let's see who else has arrived." She chirped. The reporter blushed at the sound of Akane and Ukyo's laughter.</p><p>"That was mean, Tomboy." Ranma commented cheerfully.</p><p>"She had it coming." Akane replied. She looked at Ranma. "Maybe we should have gone as U.S.A." She said apologetically. "Sorry."</p><p>"Nah, it's okay." Ranma replied. Then he grinned evilly. "You both can make it up to me later."</p><p>akane and Ukyo giggled. "Deal." They chorused. They pulled themselves closer to Ranma. "Just like old times, right Uk-chan?." Akane said.</p><p>"Yeah." Sighed Ukyo. "Just like old times."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi stood at the top of the stairs and watched as the ballroom began to fill. Kodachi's elegant gown was tight, low cut and black a veil covered her face. She looked on in approval at the efficient bustle below. Her girls, as she thought of them, met guests at the entrance way and guided each guest to their table. Though she was pleased on how well the girls had adapted to this set of duties, Kodachi was not completely satisfied. 'I must see if my old deportment teacher is available.' She decided.'You chose them well Ky, but they do need a little more polish.' She thought.<p>"Excuse me Ms. Kuno." Came a voice. Kodachi turned. "Noriko." She said in greeting. "Is there a problem?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>Noriko was dressed in a shiny blue gown that accentuated her good looks well. Kodachi had personally selected each of the girls gowns and oversaw their makeup. She noted in approval that the hairstyle that Koko had given the young woman was both sophisticated and sexy.</p><p>"I'm not sure." Noriko replied. "It's Koko." The woman explained. "The babysitter called to say she couldn't stay the whole evening and," Noriko shrugged. "She needs to go home."</p><p>"Well of course she does." Kodachi replied. "Pity, I did want to introduce her to a few people." She waved a hand at Noriko's hair. "Especially since the results are so spectacular." Kodachi sighed slightly. "I'll have a car take her home."</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied. "She was a little worried about that."</p><p>"Well let me go say goodbye at least." Kodachi started walking with Noriko on her heels. They quickly reached the suite her girls had used. Kodachi opened the door. Koko was still packing up her supplies when the door opened. Koko looked up. Except for the slight distortion to her mouth the scar was barely visible. Courtesy of Kodachi's makeup. Still the makeup couldn't hide the look of disappointment on the woman's face.</p><p>"Sorry about this Ms. Kuno." Koko said apologetically. Koko sighed and picked up a garment bag. She looked at it. "It would have been nice." She said regretfully. She put the garment bag back down. "No matter. Kiko comes first." She smiled at Kodachi. "She's a good daughter, hardly any trouble, but there's no way I'm going to leave her alone."</p><p>"Of course not." Kodachi agreed. 'I wonder how many of the girls have children." Kodachi mused. 'I know Koko is not the only one.' Kodachi walked over to Koko and linked arms with the her. "I'll have a driver take you home." She told her as she escorted her out of the room. "Next time you'll bring Kiko with you." Kodachi stopped walking. "Oh I am a fool." She said suddenly. "Go home and get Kiko and bring her back here."</p><p>"Oh Ms. Kuno, I coudn't." Protested Koko.</p><p>"Of course you can." Kodachi replied seriously. "I insist." She raised her hand as Koko made to protest. "I should have insisted earlier." Kodachi said. "I wasn't thinking." She said. "Please forgive me."</p><p>"Fo-forgive you?" Koko gasped in disbelief. Koko looked at Noriko who's open mouthed expression matched her own. "Ms. Kuno." The sudden hug Koko gave Kodachi was heartfelt. "Don't worry, you'll never know Kiko was here." Koko half babbled. She continued to throw Kodachi half adoring looks as they continued walking.</p><p>They reached a room that turned out to be a common room for the extensive Kuno staaff. Kodachi handed Koko off to a driver and she and Noriko returned to the ballroom. "Well, I suppose I should start mingling." Kodachi said. She turned to Noriko. "Shall we?" She asked the other woman. Noriko nodded.</p><p>Noriko followed Kodachi into the growing crush of people. While Kodachi greeted guests, usually by name, Noriko kept an eye on the working girls. From time to time she'd excuse herself and talk to one of the women. "How's it going Miki?" She asked one girl.</p><p>Miki was a slim girl of average height. She was the newest girl in Ky's stable, having just joined his organization a week or two before Ky was murdered. Since then Noriko had a chance to get to know her and the two had started to form a friendship. "Pretty good." She grinned. "Except for the fact that I'm not getting laid." She shared a giggle with Noriko. "Considering the number of cards I've given out, that won't be a problem." Miki craned her head to look at Kodachi. "How's she doing?" She asked.</p><p>Noriko also sought Kodachi out in the crowd. "She's doing fine." She said. "Better than fine, in fact." She told Miki what had occurred with Koko earlier.</p><p>"You're kidding." Breathed Miki.</p><p>"She's something isn't she?" Noriko said in admiration. She noticed Kodachi started moving through the crowd. "Well I better go," She said. "Just in case she needs something."</p><p>"You do that sister." Miki replied. Miki watched as Noriko walked off. She went back to her station near a table. She smiled as a guest approached. "Can I help you sir?" She asked pleasantly.</p><p>The man smiled a little uncertainly. "Um, I was wondering." He began.</p><p>Miki's smile widened. 'Kinda cute and if he's a guest of Ms. Kuno bound to have money.' She decided. "Are you asking me out?" She purred. The man nodded. "Oh I'd love to," She said. "But not tonight." She said regretfully. She pulled a card from her purse. "Call me." She handed the card to the man.</p><p>The man took the card and looked at it. It was a simple white card with nothing more than Miki's name, a phone number and address and an embossed outline of a spider and a rose in the corner. He smiled and pocketed the card.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Quite a spread." Ranma patted his stomach in anticipation as they approached the buffet table. "I hope they made enough."<p>"Careful Ranma." Akane said. "That dress is awful tight. If you eat too much you'll never get it on." She picked up a small plate and assembled a small salad. She handed the plate to Ranma. "Here." Ranma looked at the plate. Then looked at Akane. Then he looked at the plate again.</p><p>"You're being mean Akane." Ukyo scolded. She placed a single lone shrimp on Ranma's plate. "There, isn't that better?"</p><p>"No." Ranma pouted.</p><p>"Cute dress remember?" Akane said. She assembled her own salad that barely contained more on it than Ranma's plate. Ukyo made her own selection and the three walked off looking for a place to sit. They found a small table and sat down.</p><p>Ranma looked moodily at the, to him, empty plate. He sighed and started eating slowly. To distract himself he started scanning the room with all his senses. After a minute Ranma frowned. Ranma leaned over. "Tomboy look at that corner and tell me what you see." He pointed with his chin. "Don't be obvious."</p><p>Akane raised an eyebrow and looked where Ranma indicated. She frowned and turned back to Ranma. "That's weird."</p><p>"What is sugar?" Ukyo made her own assessment of the corner and didn't see anything.</p><p>"I can't focus on it." Akane replied. Ranma nodded. "Someone's hiding but it doesn't feel like the Umisenken." she scratched the tip of her nose in thought. "Gos?" She guessed.</p><p>Ranma nodded again. "I think so." Ranma said.</p><p>Ukyo looked at the corner again. She strained her chi senses to the limit, then frowned. "I still don't sense anything." She said. Ukyo chewed on a manicured fingernail. She realized what she was doing and stopped. "How come you guys can feel him and I can't?" She complained.</p><p>Ranma pulled his pigtail from behind his back and looked at the end as he thought. "Maybe cause we know him better'n you." He said after a moments thought. "The tomboy and I had some very close contact to Gos in High school and you didn't." He nodded. "yeah, I bet that's it. The Tomboy was able to detect me when I first learned the Umisenken cause of that."</p><p>"Trust me Uk-chan." Akane added. "You're not missing anything." She said. "Still, I don't like it." Akane scratched her nose again. A chime sounded. "Well too late to do anything about it now." She said. "I think that's the dinner bell." Akane smiled at the hopefull look on Ranma's face. "Cute dress, remember?"</p><p>Ranma's smile dropped. "I am so taking a doggie bag." He threatened. Then he smiled. "Yeah, it is." He said. "Oh well, the things we women do to look good." He stood. "Come on girls, let's go in."</p><p>The ballroom had been temporarily transformed into the dining room, it being the only room large enough to hold the huge number of guests that had arrived. It was slated to be converted back into a ballroom immediately afterwards for the after party. As predicted, tickets, and in true Nabiki style, a number had been made available for purchase, were a sought after commodity. Nabiki had even sold tickets to the number of fans waiting outside on the Kuno grounds to be on the grounds. She also received a piece of the concessions that had sprung up. Including the short tour of the Kuno estate that was being offered.</p><p>Not since the Imperial wedding had so excitement erupted around an impending marraige. The main dais held Tatewaki flanked by Nabiki and Kimi. Kodachi was there as was the entire Tendo family, with the exception of Akane, and the Saotome family, with the exception of Ranma. Ranma, Akane and Ukyo, along with Ryoga, Ting Li and Konatsu occupied a table just opposite them, though separated by about ten feet. Ono was seated at the main table next to Kasumi. Kodachi put Soun and Ono next to Nabiki and Kimi respectively, Nodoka sat next to Soun, then Genma. Kodachi balanced the table and sat next to Kasumi. Though there was an empty place setting next to Kodachi.</p><p>'Ky would have been sitting here.' Kodachi thought. She looked out into the crowd of guests. The service she had hired efficiently served the meals, filled the glasses and removed the dirty dishes while her team of 'hostesses' circulated. She noted as Noriko circulated among the girls she kept making sure she would look back toward Kodachi. 'You picked excellently with her Ky.' Kodachi thought. 'I suppose you must have slept with her too.' Her thought was an amused chiding. 'Still I must forgive you I suppose, she is a gem.' She raised her hand and, as Kodachi expected, Noriko veered directly toward her.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno?" Noriko greeted Kodachi in a quiet though firm voice.</p><p>"Once the guests are served, you and the girls will take the last table." Kodachi said. "Oh and has Koko returned yet?"</p><p>Noriko suppressed a grin. "Just." She replied. "She's getting dressed now."</p><p>"And Kiko?" Kodachi asked in real interest. "I asked one of the female staff to look after her." Kodachi pulled out her cell phone and punched in a number. "Yuki the little girl is, oh excellent, thank you." Kodachi disconnected. "She's already there." She smiled. "And Koko is on her way. She'll sit with you."</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." Noriko said. "We'd like that." Noriko looked at into the crowd of diners for a moment then turned her attention back to Kodachi. "Is there anything else Ms. Kuno?" Kodachi shook her head. "In that case, if you'll excuse me." She bowed. Kodachi bowed her head in return and Noriko went back to circulating among the guests and the girls.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma stared at his plate morosely. 'Why did that dress have to be so cute.' He thought. "Maybe I'll just stay a guy all evening." He muttered.<p>Akane and Ukyo looked at each other across Ranma and grinned. "I wouldn't mind." Akane said cheerfully. "But that dress is awful cute."</p><p>"Yeah." Said Ranma. He picked up his chopsticks. "I am so getting a doggie bag."</p><p>"Gods Ranma." Ryoga complained. "It's bad enough you're wearing makeup. Now you sound like a girl even when you're a guy ." He swallowed a large mouthful of something. Ryoga didn't care what it was, it tasted good and there was plenty of it. "I can't believe you're worried about eating too much."</p><p>"I'm gonna have a hard enough time puttin it on as it is." Ranma smiled evilly. "I probably will have to forget about the underwear."</p><p>"Oh like you wear underwear." Akane snickered. "The only time Ranma puts them on is just so he can take them off." Ukyo giggled in agreement.</p><p>"How come you haven't worked as a male stripper?" Konatsu asked. "I know a couple clubs that hire them."</p><p>"Who said I haven't?" Ranma replied with a smile. "Still do once in a while." He gave Ryoga a sly smile. "You should try it Ryoga, the money's pretty good and you don't gotta worry about getting beat up."</p><p>"What too-too good idea." Ting Li chirped. "I think I like see that."</p><p>"Me too." Agreed Konatsu cheerfully.</p><p>"Uh-uh, no way." Ryoga said quickly. "Those guys are all fags anyway."</p><p>"Not all." Ranma corrected. "And I wouldn't talk if I were you." He looked at Konatsu. "Why do you put up with him?" He asked seriously. "He's such a jerk."</p><p>"Oh Ryoga has his good points." Konatsu grinned. "Well one good point." Konatsu giggled. "Sometimes I can't sit for days."</p><p>"T.M.I." Ranma, Akane and Ukyo chorused in complaint.</p><p>"Konatsu." Ryoga protested at the same time. Ryoga looked down at this plate. To his surprise there was a large envelope propped against his water glass. "Where'd that come from?" He picked up the envelope and opened it. "Pictures?" Ryoga looked at one photo and paled.</p><p>Ranma reached over and snatched the envelope and pictures from Ryoga's hand. He laughed. "Looks like Gos got you in his sights." Ranma passed a picture to Akane. "Ooh, look at this one." He passed another picture to Akane. Akane passed the first picture to Ukyo.</p><p>"Give that back." Ryoga said in panic. He reached for the envelope but was stopped by Ranma's outstretched arm.</p><p>"Chill Pig boy." Ranma grinned wryly. "Welcome to the club." He said. "You should see the ones he got of us."</p><p>"Actually I like the ones he did of us." Akane shivered. "I just can't believe he was able to get so close without us noticing." Akane looked around then smiled a chipmunk smile. "Not anymore though." She said. "Got him."</p><p>"I still can't sense him.' Grumbled Ukyo petulantly.</p><p>"What you talking bout Akane?" Ting Li demanded. "Who you talking bout?" She elbowed Ryoga. "Stop that. Ranma just playing."</p><p>"Hikaru Gosunkugi." Akane said seriously. "He's standing about twenty feet to your right. Next to the pillar." She said without looking. She waited until Ting Li gave a surreptitious glance. Ting Li shook her head. "Ranma thinks you need to have had real physical contact." Akane looked up suddenly. "Hmmm. So did Kuno." She stood. "I'll be right back." Akane walked toward the main dais.</p><p>"There really someone there?" Ting Li asked. Her eyes widened at Ukyo's nod. "That not good." She decided. Ukyo nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Hey Sis." Akane said in greeting. "I need to talk to Kuno for a second." She leaned across the table. "Gos is in the room Tatewaki." She explained. "See if you can find him." She placed a hand on his shoulder. "From here."</p><p>Tatewaki frowned. "He uses his chi?" Akane nodded. "But he's not an adept." Tatewaki glanced slowly around the room. He didn't see or sense anything. "Are you sure he has not moved?" Akane nodded. Tatewaki like all chi users could feel chi. 'Even Nabiki had enough ability to sense it's use by Nakamura.' Thinking of the Yakusa made Tatewaki angry but he suppressed his feelings for the time being. 'Gos first.' He told himself. 'Gos is not a physical adept and we've always assumed you had to be a martial artist.' he mused. 'But Gos dabbled in magic. What if?' Tatewaki rubbed his chin. 'Aye the Yogi's of India, they can control the power of what they call Chakras but what if we are all speaking of the same thing?' Tatewaki concentrated.</p><p>Kimi got up slowly and quietly and walked over to Nabiki and kneeled down next to her. "What?" She whispered.</p><p>Nabiki leaned over. "My sister is a genius." She whispered back. "Tatewaki should be able to sense Gos." She turned and looked at Tatewaki. "Come on baby." She urged quietly. "You can do it."</p><p>Tatewaki smiled slowly. "Aye I can." He agreed cheerfully. "And I have. Standing next to the pillar, is he not." He said. Akane nodded. "The question is, should I let him know or not?" He said quietly.</p><p>"Keep it to yourself for now." Akane urged. "We have a little payback to deliver." She said. "But not right now." She said. "I think the boy can be useful."</p><p>"That's my baby sister." Nabiki said in approval. "I agree." She leaned over and patted Tatewaki on the chest. "Good boy." She purred. She leaned closer and kissed Tatewaki. "More later baby." She said as she sat back. "Isn't that right My Lady Kimi?"</p><p>Kimi smiled. "Oh indeed." She said happily. "My Lady Nabiki."</p><p>"Oh Gods." Akane said in disgust. "And you say we're weird." She rolled her eyes. "Good job Kuno." She said and returned to her table. She sat down. "Kuno can sense him." Akane reported. "Well that proves whatever he's doing is chi related." Ranma, then Ukyo, nodded.</p><p>"And it also proves it isn't the Umisenken." Ranma added. "It's more like what Doc Ono does." Ranma nodded. "Yeah, that's it." Ranma pursed his lips in thought. "Look for a hole Uk-chan." He said. "A blind spot." Ukyo nodded. "Okay now that we can see him, what should we do to him?" He grimaced suddenly. "Yuck, think of something else Ranma." He muttered to himself. He sighed. "We'll talk about it later." He decided. "In the meantime." Ranma grinned. "I want to see the rest of the pictures."</p><p>Tatewaki stood as a trumpet blared and an expectant hush came over the room. "Good evening." Began Tatewaki. "On behalf of my ladies and myself thank you for coming." He smiled. "Contrary to popular belief I am a man of few words." There was a general chuckle. "Still I am reminded of a story."</p><p>Akane tuned Tatewaki out. She rested her elbows on the now cleared table and rested her chin on her hands. 'Nabs looks really happy.' She thought in satisfaction. 'So does Kimi.' She rolled her eyes. 'My Lady Kimi, My Lady Nabiki.' Akane shrugged. 'Well she is the Ice Queen after all.' Akane thought. She glanced over to Ranma and Ukyo. The two were giggling over something. 'My fiance and my best friend.' The thought made Akane giggle. 'That's what Ranma said when he caught the two of us.' Akane rolled her eyes at the memory.</p><p>"Whatcha thinking Tomboy?" Ranma asked quietly.</p><p>Akane blinked as her thoughts were interrupted. Then an evil smile appeared on her face. "I'm thinking it's time for you to put on that dress." Akane replied. "That's if you still plan on wearing it."</p><p>"I didn't starve myself all week for nothing." Ranma retorted. He looked at the main dais where Tatewaki was still speaking. 'Gives me a good excuse to miss this too."</p><p>"Yeah." Agreed Akane cheerfully. "I figured you'd like that." She said. Akane made a little motion and got Nabiki's attention. She mimed pouring something over Ranma's head. Nabiki hid a laugh behind one hand. She made a little waving motion with her other. "Grab Uk-chan and let's go." Akane stood and the three quietly left the ballroom. They walked up the stairs and to the suite that Tatewaki has assigned to them. No sooner had the door to the suite closed then Akane grabbed Ranma in a bear hug from behind.</p><p>"Tomboy?" Ranma said in a confused voice. His confusion cleared up when Akane's hand snaked down to his crotch. "Oh, somebody is horny." He realized.</p><p>"No duh." Akane said cheerfully. "Now get out of those clothes." She ordered. "You too Uk-chan."</p><p>"I love it when she's demanding." Ukyo giggled. She turned around. "Unzip me Ran-chan." Seconds later Ukyo carefully pulled her dress off leaving her standing in high heels, nylons and a garter belt.</p><p>"Bad girl." Akane said in cheerful tones. "You forgot your underwear again." She pulled off her dress as well. She looked down. "Well will you look at that I forgot my underwear too. Silly me." She walked over to the bed and lay down on her back with her knees bent. She looked at Ranma through her legs. "Now weren't you complaining you didn't get enough to eat?" She purred at Ranma.</p><p>"Come to think of it." Ukyo said huskily. "I'm kind of hungry too." Ukyo licked her lips. "A little tube steak would go good right about now."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma carefully poured cold water over himself making sure not to wet his hair. The change was immediate and the female Ranma looked at herself in the mirror. She quickly undid her pig tail and brushed it out before tying it back into the pony tail she affected as a  Ranma carefully touched up her makeup before walking back into the bedroom. "How do I look?" She asked Akane and Ukyo.<p>Akane tilted her head as she considered Ranma. Akane smiled. "Gorgeous, as usual." She admitted cheerfully. "Don't you think so Uk-chan?" Ukyo nodded. "But then again we are partial to naked redheads." Ukyo nodded again.</p><p>Ranma smiled widely. "Perverts." She teased.</p><p>"Oh yeah." Akane and Ukyo chorused. They looked at each other. "She is such a slut." Akane said. "But then again, so are we." Akane and Ukyo grinned at each other. "Three of a kind." Akane said. "The baddest girls in Japan." She giggled. "Even if one of us is a guy."</p><p>"You complaining?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"No!" Akane and Ukyo chorused.</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "Yep, perverts." Ranma opened her own garment bag. "Okay time to get dressed." She pulled out her dress. It was low cut both front and back and, as Ranma had mentioned, tight. "I think I'm gonna need a little help." She said. Ranma laughed along with Akane and Ukyo. Ranma was kidding, barely and it did require a little help from Akane and Ukyo but she finally got the dress on, her stockings straightened and her hair and makeup repaired. "Okay, now how do I look?"</p><p>"Wipe your mouth Akane." Ukyo said out of the side of her mouth. "You're drooling."</p><p>"Look who's talking." Akane shot back. "Oh this is going to be a fun evening." She shook a playful finger at Ranma. "Now remember no lap dances." She said a lightly scolding tone. Akane grinned at Ranma's pout. "And you would too."</p><p>"Well, maybe one." Ranma admitted. "I was sort of thinking," Ranma blushed. "Tatewaki?"</p><p>"Don't you dare." Akane said firmly. "Nabiki would kill you." Akane grinned. "But damn it would have been fun." She laughed. "Let's stick to our original plan." Akane stood. "Okay girls, time to make an entrance."</p><p>"Like we can anything else?" Ukyo said innocently.</p><p>"I gotta do something first." Ranma smiled widely.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The reporter, Sachi Kato, sipped a cup of tea. Her station had broadcast the guest arrivals avidly and Sachi had made several updates since. 'Even the weather is cooperating.' She thought. She looked at the blazing starlit sky. "Beautiful night, ain't it?" Said a voice. "I heard you were looking for me." Sachi turned around. A short buxom redhead wearing a dress, what there was of it, that seemed glued on. "Ms. Tendo."<p>"Ah call me Ranko." Ranma smiled cutely at the reporter. "Hey Akane was right, you are cute." Ranma strode closer and the reporter was put to mind some kind of hunting animal.</p><p>"Kobe roll the camera." Hissed the reporter to her cameraman. "Ranko this is a surprise." She turned to the camera. "I'm standing in front of the Kuno mansion with Ranko Tendo." The camera pulled back to bring the two women into the frame. Ranma waved to the camera. "I mean your," Sachi paused significantly. "Friends said you would arrive later."</p><p>"Had something to do first." Ranma chirped cheerfully. Ranma smiled as several camera's began to flash. Ranma waved to the photographers and then struck several sultry poses before returning her attention to the reporter. "I'm here now."</p><p>"Y-yes you are." Stammered the reporter. She shook herself and turned to the camera. "Ranko Tendo was one of the original members of the Nerima Wrecking Crew. Ms. Tendo, the Wrecking Crew is no more."</p><p>"Not exactly." Ranma interrupted. "We still get together but, well you know how it is." Ranma shrugged and the cameraman zoomed in. Ranma smiled prettily. "The girls and I still get together."</p><p>"And Ranma?" The reporter asked.</p><p>"Oh Ranma and I find it easier when we're not too close to each other." Ranma explained. "We're too alike." Ranma smiled. "We both like being in charge." Ranma's smile became hungry. "And we have the same tastes." Ranma stared into the reporters eyes and the woman suddenly realized that Ranko had piercing blue eyes just like Ranma.</p><p>"M-ms Tendo." Stammered the reporter. 'Those eyes.' She thought. 'So alike. It couldn't be, could it?' She swallowed nervously and stepped back. It seemed to the reporter that the little redhead was laughing at her.</p><p>Ranma did laugh. "Speaking of taste."</p><p>"There you are." Akane appeared seemingly from nowhere. Ukyo was right behind her. "Hello again." She said to the reporter. She and Ukyo flanked Ranko. "Bad girl." She said in her Aoi voice. "You know we don't like to be kept waiting."</p><p>"Get a group shot." Hissed the reporter. The camera image pulled back to show Ranko, Akane and Ukyo standing close together. They waved to the camera. Then in a hail of laughter the three women walked off and up the stairs of the mansion. The camera followed them the entire distance.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The three women walked slowly through the mansion and toward the ballroom. "Do you think Kuno has finished speechifying?" Ukyo asked with a smile. She looked at her wrist and at the diamond inlayed watch, a gift from a patron of the Kabuki, that she wore. "Forty minutes."<p>"If we're lucky he's just winding down." Akane said. "If we're really lucky."</p><p>They reached the door to the ballroom and opened it.</p><p>Tatewaki took a sip of water. Tatewaki had told the assembled guests how he and Nabiki had met in High School. "As I have come to often believe, I was truly a fool then. I sought the woman of my dreams and did not realize I had already found her." He turned and smiled at Nabiki. "In truth, I believe I was so intimidated by her intelligence that I did not see the warm and vibrant woman that she truly was." Tatewaki reached over and took Nabiki's hand. "It is with great pride and even greater humbleness to know she has consented to be my wife." He pulled Nabiki gracefully to her feet. "And the future Lady Kuno."</p><p>The audience erupted in applause as Tatewaki and Nabiki met in a passionate kiss. None cheered louder than Kimi Ota.</p><p>Nodoka looked at the cheering Kimi. 'What an amazing woman.' Nodoka thought to herself. 'Nabiki was most fortunate. Most fortunate indeed.' Nodoka turned her attention to Nabiki and Tatewaki. The kiss finally ended and the couple broke apart. Nabiki took Tatewaki's place at the podium though he stood proudly behind Nabiki. 'I see Tatewaki realizes his great fortune.'</p><p>Nabiki looked at Kimi. Nodoka noted the look Nabiki gave Kimi. 'And I see Nabiki also knows how fortunate she is as well.' Nodoka smiled in satisfaction.</p><p>Nabiki smiled at Kimi then turned her attention to the guests. Her face, normally composed, was a wreath of smiles. "Thank you." She said quietly. "Both for your support and your ability to sit through one of Tatewaki's speeches." The audience chuckled. "Though I must correct Tatewaki on one thing, he was never a fool. If anything, I was the fool for not seeing him as he truly was. A good and noble man and I will be proud to be his wife." Nabiki pursed her lips for a second. "A wise man once said that true friendship is the rarest of gifts and the greatest of wealth. If that is true, and I believe it is, then I am the wealthiest of women." She said. "The gods having seen fit to give me two true friends." Nabiki smiled ruefully. "The fact that they are such true friends is, I think, more a testament to them than to me." She looked at the crowd. "Now all of you know Tatewaki and yes he is a true friend but few know of my other true friend." Tatewaki placed a hand on Nabiki's shoulder. "Our true friend." She corrected herself. "When my life seemed to be over and my future seemed dim I found her in the most unlikely of places. If it wasn't for this woman among woman we would not be standing here today. I shudder to think of where my life might have gone if it wasn't for her."</p><p>Kimi started blushing redder and redder as Nabiki continued to heap praise on her. "Nabs." She finally protested.</p><p>Tatewaki leaned forward. "And she's modest too." He said with a smile.</p><p>"That too." Nabiki said in cheerful tones. "Okay, I'll stop." She said. "But it's all true. Some of you know her, most of you do not. That will soon change." She smiled an Ice Queen smile. "Business partner, confidante, but always and in all ways she has been my friend. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Kimi Ota. My sister.</p><p>Nabiki looked up as the ballroom door opened. Three women walked, no strode, no slinked into the room. A stripper's walk. It took a moment for Nabiki to realize she was looking at Akane, Ukyo and in the middle Ranma. The women moved as if they knew, not expected, knew they would be the center of attention.</p><p>The room quieted as more and more people took notice of the three women. The women made a slow undulating advance passing their table. Ting Li and Konatsu each elbowed Ryoga hard. There was a sound of palm meeting cheek that was loud in the quiet room. "They wouldn't." Nabiki said in fascinated horror.</p><p>"Oh my." Breathed Kimi.</p><p>"If they strip I'll kill them." Nabiki grumbled. "Maybe I'll just kill them just for the heck of it." She turned to look at Tatewaki. "Be good." She ordered.</p><p>The smile that Tatewaki gave Nabiki was strained. "I." He swallowed. "I am in control my lady." He said.</p><p>There was the sound of another slap from near the end of the table. "Ono." Came Kasumi's disapproving voice.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo stopped in front of the dais. The looks on their faces were both mischievious and triumphant. "Don't worry sis, we'll keep our clothes on." Akane said in a stage whisper. Akane's smile widened when she heard the beginnings of a chant of U.S.A. She turned. "Oh it seems we have some fans here tonight. Naughty boys." She said in her Aoi voice.</p><p>"I'm surprised they recognized us with our clothes on." Ranma giggled. She hopped on the dais in front of Tatewaki. "Hey stud." Ranma purred down at Tatewaki. "Think of this as an engagement present." She was quickly joined on the table by Akane and Ukyo.</p><p>For the next few minutes Tatewaki was serenaded by the three singing, in surprisingly good harmony, En Vogues 'Giving him something he can feel.' Their movements matching the song perfectly. And, as in the video, there were a lot of men crossing their legs in order to hide their growing discomfort. Of course none of the audience had exactly the same view that Tatewaki had and, Nabiki's glares notwithstanding, Tatewaki's eyes were constantly drawn to tantelizing glimpses of bare flesh. Especially when the three stood spread legged in front of Tatewaki.</p><p>When the song, and dance, ended. The three hopped gracefully off the table and wiggled back to their seats.</p><p>Tatewaki licked dry lips. "M-my Ladies?' Tatewaki half whimpered. "Do you think we could excuse ourselves for a short while?" He begged. "I fear I may embarrass myself." He looked down. "As it is." His voice trailed off.</p><p>Despite her annoyance at her sister, Nabiki had to smile. "I think that would be a good idea." She said. She looked at Kimi. "What do you say Kimi?" She asked quietly.</p><p>"I think Tatewaki is not the only one who needs some relief." Kimi said in a hushed voice. She fanned herself with a hand. "Whew." She blew out a breath. "That was something else." She said. "No wonder U.S.A. is so popular." She stood. "If you'll excuse us for a little while." She said to Nodoka. "We need to freshen up."</p><p>Nodoka forced herself not to smile knowingly, especially since Genma was also making similar demands for attention. "Of course Kimi dear." Her hand covered her mouth as she saw Kasumi and Ono hurry out of the ballroom. She stood. "Come along Genma, I think we should take the opportunity to freshen up as well." She linked arms with Genma. "If you'll excuse us."</p><p>Soon the table was emptied except for Soun sitting open mouthed at his place.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"That was a mean trick girls." Konatsu complained mildly. Ryoga had all but carried Ting Li out of the ballroom. Konatsu, for his own reasons, decided to stay behind. 'I think I'll give him a break.' He thought. 'For now.'<p>"Well it helped clear the ballroom so the dance floor could be cleared." Ukyo chuckled. They had moved to new table near the edge of the now cleared dance floor.</p><p>Konatsu looked at the three giggling girls across the table. "You realize you blew your cover." He added seriously.</p><p>Akane shrugged. "It wasn't much of a secret anymore." She said calmly. "Three hot dancers, who happen to also be martial artists. One of which is a hot little redhead." She elbowed Ranma affectionately. "Even when Ranma dressed like a boy all the time," She shrugged. "People were already putting it together."</p><p>"Speaking of which Ranma." Konatsu drawled. "Don't you think you're blowing your macho image wearing lipstick and eyeshadow when you're a man?"</p><p>Ranma smiled slyly. "I dunno, who's gonna tell me not to?" She said. "Besides I like lookin good." The redhead waved a hand as if tossing something away. "I really don't give a shit what people think, I like it."</p><p>"Not to mention the shade suits him so well." Akane chirped. She turned to Ranma. "Baby looked good." She said in her Aoi voice.</p><p>"You're the last person I'd expect to comment on someone's sexuality." Ukyo said with a slightly dangerous tone in her voice.</p><p>"I'm not disapproving." Konatsu replied easily. "I'm just curious." He leaned his chin on his elbow. "So Ranma, what are you?"</p><p>"A straight lesbian." Ranma replied. "Or maybe a gay heterosexual." Ranma laughed. "None of those labels mean anything to me Natsu." She grinned. "I'm a Ranma." She chirped. Akane and Ukyo giggled in agreement. "Why? You interested?"</p><p>"Well yeah." Konatsu drawled. "Duh."</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow and waved a hand down her body. "Could you give this body what it needs?" She asked. "Toys ain't the same." She said firmly.</p><p>"Now that could be a problem." Konatsu admitted.</p><p>"Not for the Tomboy." Ranma smiled as Akane put her arm around her waist. "Right baby?"</p><p>"You know it baby." Akane said in her Aoi voice. "Got to give baby what she needs." She cooed. Their lips met in a brief kiss.</p><p>"That's why they're a couple Konatsu." Ukyo said. "They give each other what they need."</p><p>"Couple?" Konatsu said in surprise. "I thought."</p><p>Ukyo shrugged. "They want me to stay, so I stay." Ukyo looked at the cuddling Ranma and Akane. "They're a couple Konatsu, I'm the third wheel. I've accepted that." She grinned wryly. "Right now I'm part of what they need." Ukyo fended off a tickling finger from Akane. "Stop that." Ukyo ordered.</p><p>"You're being too serious Uk-chan." Akane scolded.</p><p>"Sorry Tomboy." Ukyo said contritely. "Forgive me?"</p><p>"Of course I do." Akane replied. "But you're still getting punished later."</p><p>Ukyo grinned. "Oh good." She looked up. "Company." She pointed with her chin as what looked like a dozen woman approached somewhat hesitantly. One woman stepped forward. "Yes?" Inquired Ukyo.</p><p>"Excuse me for bothering you." She said. "I am Noriko Mata." She bowed briefly. Then waved her hand to encompass the women behind her. "We were wondering." She hesitated. "You're U.S.A. aren't you?"</p><p>"I'm Sugoi." Ukyo said. "At least on stage." Ukyo grinned. "What can I do for you Noriko?"</p><p>"Well first off." She thrust out a pad and pen. "Could I get your autograph?" She pleaded. "You guys dance great." Ukyo grinned and took the pad and pen.</p><p>Kodachi looked up at the burst of laughter. She looked toward the sound. "Now what in heaven's name?" Her eyes widened when she realized it was her 'girls.' Kodachi frowned and strode over. "Girls." Kodachi said sternly as she approached. "You know you're not supposed to annoy the guests. I'm surprised at all of you but especially you Noriko."</p><p>"Chill Kodachi." Ranma said with a chuckle. "We don't mind."</p><p>"That's not the point." Kodachi said. "This won't do."</p><p>"Sorry Ms. Kuno." Noriko said miserably.</p><p>"What were you thinking?" Kodachi said angrily.</p><p>"I was hoping to ask them to teach us to dance." Noriko said in a tiny voice. "I thought if we." She stopped and hung her head. "Sorry Ms. Kuno.</p><p>"Go on." Ordered Kodachi.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno?" Noriko asked in confusion.</p><p>"Finish the thought." Ordered Kodachi.</p><p>Noriko licked dry lips. "I thought we could do a caberet?" She asked more than said. "Maybe in period costume?"</p><p>'Oh my, how do I punish her for that?' Kodachi thought. She kept a stern expression on her face. "I see." Kodachi rubbed the tip of her nose in thought. "I don't know." She said slowly.</p><p>"Hey we'd be happy to help." Ranma said. "Wouldn't we guys?" Akane and Ukyo nodded cheerfully.</p><p>"That may be true but there is a principle to consider." Kodachi said. 'Oh. Ky what do I do? I must find a way for both of us to save face.' She thought frantically.</p><p>"Oh give her a break Kodachi." Ranma said. She tilted her head. "If ya gotta punish her make her be the first to learn." She turned to Noriko. "And you ain't getting off easy."</p><p>'Thank you Ranma.' Kodachi said silently. "You are too forgiving however if Noriko is willing to accept that task I guess I could see my way to," Kodachi raised her veil and caught Noriko's eyes. "Forgive her."</p><p>Noriko bowed low. "Ms. Kuno is generous. I accept."</p><p>Kodachi lowered her veil. "Excellent." She said. Kodachi looked at the clustered women. "Well? Why are you all standing around?" She waved her hands. "Go." There was a almost unified chorus of 'Ms. Kuno' and the women walked quickly away. Kodachi watched them walk off. She smiled when she saw all the other women cluster around Noriko. Kodachi turned. "Thank you Ranma." She said aloud. "You gave me a reason not to demote her. For that I am grateful."</p><p>"I kinda figured you were lookin for an out." Ranma replied. "Don't worry. She'll think she's punished." She and Kodachi exchanged knowing smiles. She waved a hand. "Sit for a moment." Ranma smiled. "It's what a proper hostess would do."</p><p>Kodachi smiled. "Indeed." She sat. "Hello Konatsu. "</p><p>"Hey girlfriend." Konatsu replied. "How are you holding up?" He asked in a concerned voice. "Haven't seen much of you recently."</p><p>"Sorry Konatsu." Kodachi leaned back in the chair and sighed. "I'm doing well." She said simply. Her hand went to where the bullet lay between her breasts. "Most of the time."</p><p>Ranma looked off the where Kodachi's girls were clustered. She nodded as she saw Noriko pointing and gesturing and the woman started moving into assigned areas. "hmm." Ranma murmurred. She turned back to Kodachi. "I was wondering when you were planning to teach them martial arts gymnastics." She said. 'She probably didn't even think of it.' Ranma fought down a smile. 'and it would keep her busy.' She looked at Kodachi. "The girls and I can't be everywhere y'know."</p><p>Kodachi raised a finger in protest and held it. Her mouth opened and closed a few times before she finally closed it and sat back. 'What do you think Ky?' She thought. "Not all of them could learn but one or two certainly.' Kodachi's finger rubbed her chin slowly. 'It is in keeping with what the Ice Queen had in mind.' Kodachi continued to think silently to herself.</p><p>Ranma looked at Kodachi. 'Good.' She thought. "Hey girls feel like dancing?" She said. "I think I see the band coming in." Ranma stood. "Let's see if we can make this party happen." She said expectantly.</p><p>"Oh Nabiki is so going to kill us." Akane said in unhappy tones. She grinned. "Let's do it." She stood. "In fact." She leaned forward. "Kodachi." She called to the silent woman. Kodachi looked up questioningly. "Noriko's lessons start tonight, okay?" A slight smile came to Kodachi's face and she nodded then she returned to her thoughts. "Keep an eye on her Konatsu." Akane made it an order. Konatsu waved a hand. "Let's go see what this band can do." She said and strode toward where the band was setting up. Ranma and Ukyo quickly matched her strides.</p><p>"U.S.A. or Terrible Three?" Ukyo asked. "Personally I feel kind of Sugoi tonight." She smiled as Akane and Ranma laughed. "Cool."</p><p>The three women's strides changed subtly as they approached the band. There seemed to be a rhythm to their walk as if they already heard the music. The band members had already noticed them and were standing up straighter. One, a tall shaggy haired youth, stepped forward. He smiled. His smile widened as the three women clustered around him. "Hi, I'm Hiro." He said.</p><p>"Hey Hiro." Ranma said in a sultry voice. "What are you going to play for us tonight?" She asked. "Please tell me it's jazz." She said cutely. "I love jazz."</p><p>"Me too." Chorused Akane and Ukyo. They giggled.</p><p>Hiro's smile widened. "Well it just so happens." He began before he was interrrupted by a triple squeal of happiness. "Dancers?" He said questioningly. They nodded. His head tilted. "Hey Ogaki." He called over his shoulder. "Remember that club we went to a couple weeks ago?"</p><p>"The one with the hot trio?" The other man replied. He looked over to where Hiro was standing. 'Jeezus." He exclaimed. "It's them." He hurried over. "You guys gonna dance?" He asked. They nodded. The man reached up and pinched his arm. "Yeah." He said. "I'm not dreaming." He nodded. "Hang on." He walked over to a stack of instruments and picked up a guitar and a little hand drum about ten inches across. There were cymbals along the perimeter of the drum. He walked over to Hiro and handed him the guitar. "How does Samba sound?" He started beating a simple rhythm on the drum. Hiro started playing a soft melody.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo smiled approvingly. "That sounds very nice." Ranma purred. "Good boys. Now you keep it mellow for now." She continued. "Sugoi will," Ranma looked over to where Ukyo was already dancing sensually to the beat. From the expressions on the band members faces, as they hurried to set up and join in, they appreciated Ukyo's efforts. "Never mind." Ranma took Akane's hand. "Come on Tomboy, let's get Noriko and hurry back." She spun Akane in a circle. "I feel like dancing."</p><p>Ranma pulled Akane along as they searched for Noriko. Akane smiled happily. 'We're us again.' She thought. Akane let Ranma pull her along. "There she is." Akane pointed. They quickly made their way to Noriko. "Hey Noriko." Akane called as they approached. "Your training starts now."</p><p>Noriko looked blank for a second then her expression changed to one of both worry and anticipation. "Of course." She said and followed Akane and Ranma back to where Ukyo, as Sugoi, was putting on an impromptu and, for her, sedate show. Akane placed Noriko next to her. "Now you follow what we do." She said. She started moving her feet. "One, two, three, one, two, three." She said. "That's the way." She said as Noriko started to follow. "And remember to smile."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi sat silently in thought. Ting Li and Ryoga rejoined the table and looked questioningly at the silent Kodachi. Konatsu shook his head and indicted they should leave her alone. Ting Li nodded. 'It's an interesting idea, isn't it Ky?' Kodachi thought. 'Oh I know you probably don't approve but you aren't here to protect them.' Kodachi's expression became sad and her hand went to the bullet that lay between her breasts. Kodachi sighed. 'I miss you.'<p>"Don't be sad." Came a childish voice at her elbow.</p><p>Kodachi started and looked around. There was a little girl of about five wearing Hello Kitty pajamas. "Kiko." Kodachi said in recognition. To her surprise the little girl climbed into Kodachi's lap. "You should be in bed." Kodachi said softly. "Still I don't suppose I can blame you." Kodachi looked down at the little girl. "Do I look sad?" She asked.</p><p>Kiko nodded. She twisted around to look at Kodachi. "Is that why you wear that?' She pointed at the veil. "So no one can see when you cry?"</p><p>Kodachi swallowed and nodded. Kiko looked at Kodachi for a moment then leaned against her. "When mommy was sad she let me sit on her lap. She said it made her not feel so sad anymore." She sat quietly on Kodachi's lap. Kodachi hesititated for a moment then wrapped her arms around the little girl. To Kodachi's surprise it did seem to make her feel better. The sound of running feet made Kodachi look up. As she expected it was Koko.</p><p>"Kiko." Koko exclaimed. She bowed frantically to Kodachi. "A thousand apologies Ms Kuno." The woman said quickly "I'll take her home right away."</p><p>Kodachi looked at the little girl. "You don't want to go home do you?" Kodachi asked the little girl. Kiko shook her head. A faint smile came to Kodachi. "Then you won't." She declared. "But you will go back to bed, won't you?" She squeezed the little girl. "Thank you." Kodachi said quietly. She handed Kiko off to her mother. "You'll join us for breakfast. Both of you." She said.</p><p>"Yes Ms. Kuno." Koko said nervously. Kiko waved goodnight to Kodachi as she was led away.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki and Kimi sat side by side in front of a large vanity mirror reapplying their makeup. Nabiki looked at Kimi in the mirror and the two women exchanged very satisfied smiles. "I really should kill the three of them but," Nabiki laughed. "Lover boy was certainly stimulated."<p>"That he was, and he wasn't the only one." Kimi dimpled a smile. "Now was he, My Lady Nabiki?" Kimi reached over and placed a hand on Nabiki's shoulder. "maybe we should learn to dance like that." She suggested. "What do you think?"</p><p>"I think I'll leave it to the professionals." Nabiki replied. "You know all I care about is results." She and Kimi laughed. Nabiki looked at Kimi. "Thanks Kimi." She said.</p><p>"for what Nabs?" Kimi gave Nabiki a curious look.</p><p>"for being here." Nabiki replied. "for being our friend." She said. "But mostly for being Kimi." Nabiki stood. "Ready to rejoin the party, My Lady Kimi?"</p><p>Kimi stood. "Of course, My Lady Nabiki." She replied. "let's grab Tatewaki and go."</p><p>"If he's still awake." Nabiki smiled at her reflection. Then her features composed themselves into their Ice Queen immobility.</p><p>"You know it's scarey how you can do that." Kimi commented. "When I try it just looks like I have gas." Kimi smiled triumphantly at the twitch of Nabiki's lips. "Gotcha."</p><p>Nabiki composed her features once again. "I've had years to perfect the Ice Queen." She hooked her arm through Kimi's and they walked back into the bedroom. Tatewaki was just finished buttoning his shirt, the tie hung loose around his neck. His silk jacket lay on the bed. He turned as they entered the room. Nabiki let go of Kimi's arm and walked over to Tatewaki. "Let me." She said. She reached for his tie. Their eyes met.</p><p>Kimi watched as Nabiki tied Tatewaki's bowtie. 'That's my girl.' She thought. 'The Ice Queen and the Blue Thunder." She rubbed her nose in unconscious imitation of Nabiki. 'And that makes me, what?' Kimi walked over and picked up Tatewaki's coat and helped him shrug it on. 'Lady in waiting? No. Handmaiden? Not likely.' Kimi waited until Nabiki claimed Tatewaki's arm before she took the other. Kimi looked across Tatewaki and caught Nabiki's eye. 'I'm sure someone will start calling me something.' The last thought made Kimi smile.</p><p>By the time they returned to the ballroom the party was in full swing. The band was playing something hot and smoky. A saxophone was wailing mournfully. The crowd around the band made it impossible to see anything but Tatewaki made a path. "If they're stripping, I'll kill them." Nabiki threatened. The crowd stopped at the edge of a large ring around the band.</p><p>The four women dancing weren't stripping. Though the moves were reminiscent. Two of the four women. Ranma and Ukyo were treating the audience to a duo dance routine while Akane seemed to be showing a fourth woman some steps.</p><p>"Remember to smile." Nabiki heard Akane say. "Smiles bring tips." She said. "Now do those steps again."</p><p>Nabiki looked around. She noticed Kodachi standing off to one side watching Noriko critically. A cluster of Kodachi's girls stood just behind her splitting their attention between Noriko and Kodachi. Several of the woman were imitating the steps Akane was showing Noriko. 'Interesting.' Nabiki smiled. "That looks like fun." She said. She turned as several people shoved their way to the front.</p><p>"Wait for me." Came Ting Li's excited voice. Soon the orange haired amazon was dancing along with Ranma and Ukyo. A moment later Konatsu joined the dancers.</p><p>"How do you think I know what clubs hire male dancers?" Konatsu wiggled sexily to the music. "It's just like doing martial arts."</p><p>"Ranma was right about that." Ukyo hiked up her skirt and gyrated down to her heels then wiggled ass first into a standing position to a chorus of appreciative whistles and cheers. "Damn we could have made a mint tonight."</p><p>"No kidding." Laughed Ranma. "Hey Ting Li where's Pig Boy?"</p><p>"Right here little girl." Ryoga stood at the edge of the circle. He reached in to his pocket and pulled out a large wad of low denomination yen. "Just in case you need some incentive."</p><p>And the band played hot and smoky long into the night.</p><p>Author's Notes: Thought I'd give you an early present for the Holidays.</p>
