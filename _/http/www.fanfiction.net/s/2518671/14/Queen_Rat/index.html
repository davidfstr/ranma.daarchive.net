</div><p><b>Chapter 14</b></p><p><b>'Undercover'</b></p><p><b>Ranma, in male form, watched from the rooftop of Nabiki's apartment building. He watched Nabiki and Kimi enter the limo. "Okay, let's go." He said as the car drove off. Ranma started running along the roof tops. Akane and Ukyo following closely behind. Ranma smiled in contentment. 'Just like old times.' He thought. The three of them were dressed in black to better blend into the evening sky. Even Ukyo's battle spatula was covered with a black cloth. They followed the car for nearly half an hour before it slowed and turned into the driveway of a large estate. The car stopped in front of a gate that slid open a few seconds later. The car continued up the driveway.</b></p><p><b>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo hopped over the wall surrounding the estate and followed; concealed by the gardens and trees. Suddenly Ranma raised a hand and all three stopped. "Cameras." Ranma pointed. He looked around. "That way." He said. The three raced off in the new direction. By a circuitous path, they finally reached the house. The mansion was built in a traditional Japanese feudal style. Heavy wooden beams and curved arches defined the building. Three stories in height and constructed with an eye toward defense and security. Still the three were easily able to climb the side of the building and enter through a third story window.</b></p><p><b>The door to the mansion opened as the limo drove up. Kenichi Satoh walked out and down the stairs. The driver opened the door to the limo just as Kenichi arrived. His smile of anticipation changed to one of appreciation as first Nabiki and then Kimi stepped out of the car. Both women were dressed in tight fitting yet elegant evening gowns. Nabiki wore her trademark black while Kimi was in a gown of a dark electric blue.</b></p><p>"<b>Kenichi." Purred Nabiki. She pirouetted slowly in place. "Do you approve?"</b></p><p><b>Kenichi gave Nabiki a somewhat possessive look. "Excellent." He replied. He offered his arms to Nabiki and Kimi. The two women linked their arms through his and he led them back into the house. "My guests are still arriving." Kenichi said as the entered a large room. "Mostly associates of my father's." He said somewhat apologetically. He turned to Kimi. "My father will be very happy to see you."</b></p><p><b>Kimi swallowed a grimace and smiled brightly. "Where is the old cutie?' She asked. "I must say hello." She looked around. "Oh there he is." She said.</b></p><p><b>Kenichi escorted Nabiki and Kimi over to where several old men were seated on chairs around a low table. "Father." Kenichi greeted the old man. He gave the remaining men respectful nods. "Look who has come to see you."</b></p><p>"<b>Su." The senior Satoh said happily. "Come here and give an old man a kiss."</b></p><p><b>Kimi unlinked her arm from Kenichi. "Cutie." She said in happy tones. She walked over and kissed the old man on the cheek. Then stood behind the old man and started to massage his shoulders through his expensive suit. "Are you working too hard again?" She said in a scolding tone.</b></p><p><b>The old man smiled happily. He reached up and patted one of Kimi's hands. "Now Su." He said in an attempted stern voice. "I must attend to business." He said. His expression turned smug at the looks of envy coming from his colleagues. "She worries so." He said.</b></p><p>"<b>Of course I do cutie." Kimi said. "You're a very important man. I'll just have to make sure you relax properly later." The old man settled back in his chair with a pleased expression.</b></p><p>"<b>We'll be back later." Kenichi said. "Come along Mari."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki and Kimi exchanged glances the Nabiki turned her attention on Kenichi. "Please, you must show me around this wonderful place." Nabiki smiled. "Before the rest of your guests arrive."</b></p><p><b>Kenichi's smile was almost a leer. "That's exactly what I had in mind." He escorted Nabiki away. </b></p><p><b>Kimi watched as Kenichi and Nabiki reached a set of stairs and ascended up it. She shrugged slightly. 'She's a big girl.' She thought mostly to reassure herself. 'Gods I hate it when we're separated.' She turned her attention to the old man. "Is your glass empty cutie?" She asked. "Let Su refill it for you."</b></p><p><b>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo sneaked through the house. They had reached the second floor without incident. The second floor corridor was brightly lit. "Damn no way around it." Ranma said quietly. He led them to the nearest door. Ranma placed his ear against the door then quickly opened it. The three hurried in. It was a bedroom. "We're gonna have to go around the outside." He walked toward a drapery curtained window in the back of the room. Ranma looked out of the window. He nodded and began to open the window. He froze as the door to the bedroom opened. Everyone held their breath and hid behind the drapes.</b></p><p><b>In the gloom of the unlit room. The three watched as two people entered the room. A stocky, almost fat, man and a slim young woman with long blond hair. The man sat on the edge of the bed while the woman, after a moment, kneeled between the man's legs. </b></p><p><b>Akane smiled in amusement as she realized what the blond was doing to the man. 'Blond?' She thought suddenly. She squinted at the figures in the darkened room. 'Oh shit, that's Nabiki.' Suddenly Akane started to glow in anger. The glow winked out when a hand clamped across her mouth. She looked up. Ranma looked down at her and shook his head firmly.</b></p><p><b>Akane swallowed her anger. After a long moment she nodded. Ranma removed his hand. Akane waited in fuming silence as she tried to ignore what was happening in the bedroom beyond. After what, to Akane, seemed like an eternity in hell she heard the door to the bedroom open. Ranma looked out and nodded.</b></p><p>"<b>They're gone." He said. He turned his attention to the window.</b></p><p>"<b>Your sister is either a very brave woman." Ukyo said quietly. "Or a very angry one."</b></p><p>"<b>Both, Uk-chan." Ranma said from the window. "Satoh, our Satoh from the prison, beat Kimi pretty badly. As angry as I am for what happened to you, I don't think I'd be brave enough to get my revenge that way."</b></p><p><b>Akane looked up, startled. She looked toward the now empty bed. 'Gods, I'm such an idiot.' She thought. "Come on guys." She said. "Let's do what we came here to do." Akane looked back at the bed. 'Watch yourself sis.' She turned away. </b></p><p><b>Ranma had the window opened. He climbed out and began creeping along the wall. His fingers and toes held him tightly to the side of the house. Akane and then Ukyo followed him as he climbed along the walls. </b></p><p><b>Kimi felt her smile beginning to fray as she kept on splitting her attention on the old man and the stair case. She had laughingly fended off all of the old men's attempts at either copping a feel or attempting to entice her away from the senior Satoh with promises of expensive gifts. Still it hadn't been all boring. Some of the things the old men had been saying had been very interesting indeed. Kimi had quickly realized that they had struck pay dirt. When she had been introduced the other old men she had recognized one name. That name being the same as one of the members of the prison board. The other names she didn't recognize but she filed them for later.</b></p><p><b>Even so it was with a suppressed sigh of relief when she saw Nabiki and Kenichi Satoh approaching. Nabiki grabbed a glass of champagne from a passing waiter and took a deep swallow. "Excuse me lover." She said to Kenichi. "But I must repair my face."</b></p><p><b>Kimi leaned closer to the old man. "I'll be right back cutie." She said. She pinched his cheek gently. "Don't go anywhere."</b></p><p><b>Kenichi waved Nabiki off genially. Father and son watched the two women walk away appreciatively. Nabiki and Kimi quickly found a bathroom. Nabiki checked the stalls then walked over to the faucet and turned the water on. She rinsed her mouth out several times before speaking. "Remind me to apologize to Ranma next time I see him." She said cryptically. She turned to Kimi. "At least he's quick."</b></p><p>"<b>Having second thoughts girlfriend?" Kimi asked in concern.</b></p><p>"<b>Never." Nabiki replied firmly. "They're going to pay." Nabiki and Kimi exchanged a look of determination. Suddenly Nabiki's face split into lopsided smile. "Want to trade?" Nabiki opened her purse and started reapplying her makeup.</b></p><p><b>Kimi laughed. "What a choice." Her expression fell. "I don't feel good about being separated from you." She said seriously.</b></p><p><b>Nabiki walked over and put her hand on Kimi's shoulder. "Just keep your eyes open and remember what I taught you." Over the passed several months since they left the prison, Nabiki had been teaching Kimi as much as she remembered of the Tendo style of martial arts. Nabiki found her body remembering while she trained with Kimi. "If anything happens you stay put and I'll come get you." She smiled reassuringly. "Besides we'll have some guardian angels to watch over us."</b></p><p><b>Ranma crept along the darkened and deserted corridor. He had left Akane and Ukyo to continue searching the rooms on the second floor while he searched the basement. The darkness allowed Ranma to use the umisenken. He'd tried to teach it to Akane and Ukyo but neither had been very successful so far. 'At least they get to practice tonight.' He thought as he crept along. </b></p><p><b>The basement, Ranma noted, had been divided into a number of rooms. All connected by the one corridor. Ranma cautiously opened the first door he found. He walked in to the darkened room. 'Well I guess even Yakuza go grocery shopping.' He thought. He gave the pantry a look around before backing out and closing the door behind him. He padded along the corridor. Opening door after door. His search didn't lead to anything of interest or at least not incriminating. "He must stash the stuff in a warehouse. " Ranma said to himself as he opened the next door. "Hmm. Now this looks interesting." </b></p><p><b>The room was an office. "All those rooms above and he has an office down here." Ranma mused. Ranma made a quick scan of the room before he entered. He couldn't see a camera but that didn't mean there wasn't one. Ranma pulled himself deeper into the umisenken and eased into the room. Ranma crept along the floor almost snakelike. If one had looked closely, you could see that he was being propelled by his rapidly flexing fingers and toes. His body held just above the wooden floor. 'And I thought Tea Ceremony Martial Arts was stupid.' Ranma slithered toward the desk. Oozing into the chair, Ranma began opening drawers. He smiled. </b></p><p><b>Akane and Ukyo climbed across the side of the house. Ukyo followed Akane. Mainly because even though Ukyo had been training, she was still not at full potential. Akane looked for the easiest path she could find. The fact that Ukyo could even follow was a testament to her level of recovery. Akane pulled herself on to a window ledge. Ukyo followed a moment later. Akane flipped her black glove down from the wrist. "9:00 p.m." she said quietly. "They're probably eating right now."</b></p><p>"<b>We'll steal some leftovers from the kitchen later." Ukyo replied. Ukyo looked through the window. She pulled one of her spatula shaped knives from her bandoleer and worked it against the lock. In moments she pushed the window open and the two women eased into the darkened room. "Another bedroom." She said. "Guest room." She amended. She looked at Akane. "You okay sugar?"</b></p><p><b>Akane nodded. "Yeah, just worried about Nabs." She amplified. "And Kimi." She added a moment later. "They're in pretty deep."</b></p><p><b>Ukyo nodded in agreement. "Well we'll just have to make sure nothing bad happens." She replied. "Once the guests leave this place will close down tight."</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah, but in the meantime, I have no way of checking on her, them." Akane said in a quiet growl. </b></p><p><b>Ukyo chewed on her lower lip for a moment. Then she nodded. "Let's go see if we can find a place to watch from." She walked back to the window. "We might as well check out the first floor anyway."</b></p><p>"<b>What are we waiting for?" Akane said. "Let's go."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki chatted amiably with the man seated on her left. On her right was Kenichi. He sat near, but not at the head of the table. That position was held by the senior Satoh. On the old man's right sat Kimi. An old woman sat on the old man's left. She had been introduced to Kimi as the old man's sister. Kenichi sat to the old woman's left. The table itself was large enough to accommodate the thirty or so guests comfortably. </b></p><p><b>Kimi turned to Kenichi. His wine glass was low so Nabiki refilled it for him. She looked up to see the old woman looking at her. Nabiki smiled pleasantly. The old woman gave Nabiki a bare nod in return. The woman leaned across the table. "I see you have manners at least." She said in grudging approval. </b></p><p>"<b>Now Auntie, leave my date alone." Kenichi said in an amused tone.</b></p><p>"<b>Date." The woman snorted quietly. "She's young enough to be your daughter. At least she's a cut above what you normally bring here." She looked at Nabiki again. "Those manners are too natural to be studied." She said. "Your family kept the old ways, didn't they?"</b></p><p><b>Nabiki inclined her head in agreement. "To a degree," She clarified. "In many ways my parents were very old fashioned."</b></p><p>"<b>Well at least they understood manners." The old woman sat back up. "So many young people today don't understand the importance of good manners." She said irritably. The woman leaned over again. "You can tell a lot about a person by their table manners. You, young lady, are a woman with a secret."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki placed a smile on her face. "Don't all women have secrets?' She asked with an amused tone.</b></p><p><b>The woman cackled in appreciation. "I like her Kenichi." She said. "You can bring her back."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki breathed an inward sigh of relief. 'Subtract fifty pounds and add forty years.' She thought. 'If she isn't Kigomi's grandmother,' Nabiki smiled at Kimi. Kimi nodded back. 'It's a good thing I checked with Noriudo before we came.' Kigomi Satoh was still safely in prison. 'No sudden dramatic entrance and discovery.' Nabiki sipped her wine. </b></p><p><b>Nabiki casually looked around, something had been nagging at her for a while. She raised her eyes toward the ceiling and almost choked on her wine. One of the thick wooden beams holding up the high angled ceiling had waved at her. Nabiki blinked and slowly made out a form resting on top of one thick wooden beam. 'Damn, I think that's Akane.' She let her eyes wander around the room. She couldn't find anyone else. 'Either they're better hidden or they're not here. Definitely close by though.' She looked back at the rafter but could no longer see Akane. 'Not bad sis.' Nabiki felt some of the concealed tension drain from her.</b></p><p><b>Ukyo lay on the angled eaves of the building. Just below her was the small vent opening that Akane had used to enter the dining hall. Ukyo suddenly whirled around. "Ran-chan." She whispered. "Don't sneak up on me like that."</b></p><p>"<b>Sorry Uk-chan." Ranma frowned. "Where's the Tomboy?"</b></p><p><b>Ukyo pointed down. "In the dining hall, watching Nabs and Kimi." She said. "Don't worry she's well hidden."</b></p><p><b>Ranma grunted in approval. He lay down next to Ukyo. "We'll wait here." He decided. "We'll find a place to sleep for the evening after everyone else goes to bed." He smiled. "Just like old times eh Uk-chan?"</b></p><p>"<b>Just like Ran-chan." Ukyo replied. "Find anything interesting?"</b></p><p><b>Ranma nodded. He pulled a pad from his pocket. "I copied a bunch of names and numbers from a phone book I found in an office in the basement. I'll give it to Nabs later." He turned his head. "How bout you guys?"</b></p><p><b>Ukyo shook her head in disgust. "Nothing." She said. "I don't think there are any drugs here."</b></p><p>"<b>Didn't think there would be Uk-chan." Ranma said quietly. "Probably in a warehouse somewhere. The trick is to find which one." he waved the pad. "Maybe the location is in here."</b></p><p><b>They waited for Akane for nearly two hours. She came scrambling over the side of the building. "Okay the party is over and people are getting ready to leave." She reported. "Lets go find a place to hole up for the night."</b></p><p>"<b>That room on the third floor didn't look like it's been occupied for some time." Ukyo suggested. "Should be safe." Ranma nodded in approval.</b></p><p><b>The three got to their feet and ascended the side of the building. They quickly reached the empty room on the third floor. The room was another guest room but, as Ukyo had observed, one that hadn't seen use in some time. Ukyo lay down on the bed. "Wake me in a couple hours." She said. She closed her eyes.</b></p><p>"<b>Why don't you rest as well Tomboy." Ranma suggested. </b></p><p><b>Akane looked at the bed. She nodded. "Okay, but just a couple hours. You need to sleep too."</b></p><p>"<b>Watching my back Tomboy?" Ranma asked.</b></p><p>"<b>Damn straight." Akane replied. She lay down on the bed next to Ukyo and closed her eyes. </b></p><p><b>When he was sure both Akane and Ukyo were asleep Ranma eased out of the room and faded into the darkness. He padded unseen around the big house. He stopped at one door when he heard faint groans coming from within. Ranma shivered. 'I don't know how you do it Nabs.' he thought in respect. 'I always wished you knew what you did to me felt like. Now that you do, I'm sorry I ever made that wish.' Ranma continued his travels through the mansion. </b></p><p><b>He returned to the room a couple hours later. He walked over to the bed and shook the two women awake. He handed the two sleepy eyed women a plate each. "Leftovers." He said. "Pretty good too."</b></p><p><b>Akane and Ukyo dug hungrily into the food. </b></p><p><b>Ranma stretched. "I'm gonna take a nap."</b></p><p>"<b>Go ahead Ranma." Akane said. "Ukyo and I will wake you in a couple hours." Akane watched and waited until Ranma was snoring quietly before turning to Ukyo. "How's the shoulder?" She asked quietly.</b></p><p><b>Ukyo nodded. "Fine." She replied in the same tone. "You okay?"</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah." Akane replied. "Just worried about Nabs." Akane sighed. "Thanks." She said. "For before."</b></p><p>"<b>Heck sugar." Ukyo replied. "If that was my sister in there, I'd want to be watching over her too." She looked at Akane in concern. "You want to talk about it?"</b></p><p>"<b>Not really." Akane replied. Akane looked toward the bed. "Do you think he's forgiven me?" She asked quietly.</b></p><p>"<b>Of course he has." Ukyo replied. "He's Ranma."</b></p><p><b>Akane nodded and continued looking at Ranma. She quickly wiped away a tear. "Yeah." She said without turning her head. "He's Ranma."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki got up from the bed and made her way to the bathroom. She grabbed a wash cloth and tried to wipe some of the sweat and other things off her body. She washed her face and then padded back to the bed. Kenichi was asleep and snoring loudly. 'Pig.' She thought in disgust. She got back under the covers and forced herself to cuddle close to Kenichi. 'I sure hope the guys found something to make this all worthwhile.' She thought as sleep overtook her.</b></p><p><b>End Chapter 14</b></p>
