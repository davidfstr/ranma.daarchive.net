</div><p><b>Chapter 3</b></p><p>'<b>Visiting Day'</b></p><p>"<b>Hello Doctor."</b></p><p>"<b>Mrs. Saotome." Exclaimed Ono Tofu. "This is an unexpected surprise." The doctor led the elder woman over to a chair opposite his desk. "Please sit down." Nodoka sat. "Now what seems to be the problem?"</b></p><p><b>Nodoka smiled. "Oh there's nothing wrong with me." She said. "I'm here for another reason altogether." She looked around. "You wouldn't happen to have any tea, would you?"</b></p><p>"<b>Oh where are my manners?" Dr. Tofu stood and hurried over to a low table. "It will just be a moment." On the table was a machine that he filled with water. "I love modern conveniences." He said. "Especially tea makers." Dr. Tofu pressed a button. "It makes surprisingly good tea." Several minutes later he carried over a carafe and two tea cups. He allowed Nodoka to pour the tea. </b></p><p><b>Nodoka took a sip. Her eyebrow rose. "I'm impressed."</b></p><p>"<b>You were saying." Dr. Tofu prompted. "The reason for your visit."</b></p><p>"<b>Ah yes." Nodoka took a sip of her tea. "Kasumi." She said suddenly.</b></p><p>"<b>K-k-kasumi." The doctor stammered. The doctor's glasses steamed up and a silly smile came to his face. Nodoka leaned across the table and slapped the doctor. "What happened?" Dr. Tofu asked in confusion. He pressed his hand against his cheek. "You slapped me."</b></p><p><b>Nodoka shook her head. "She told me but I didn't believe it." She murmured. "Honestly Doctor, a man of your age acting so foolish." Nodoka placed the tea cup on the desk. "I'm half tempted to tell her to look for someone else."</b></p><p>"<b>No please." Pleaded Dr. Tofu in an anguished voice. "Don't do that."</b></p><p><b>Nodoka picked up the cup. "Give me one good reason." She said cooly.</b></p><p>"<b>I. I love her." The doctor replied.</b></p><p>"<b>Well that's obvious." Nodoka rolled her eyes. "But unless you can learn to act normally around her," Nodoka didn't finish the threat. From the look on the Doctor's face she didn't need to.</b></p><p>"<b>I'm trying Nodoka." Dr. Tofu stammered. "But every time I see her or even hear her name." Dr. Tofu looked down at the desk. The very image of anguish and shame. "I've tried everything; meditation, hypnosis, even drugs. Nothing works."</b></p><p>"<b>Apparently a slap in the face works." Observed Nodoka. "You will come to dinner tomorrow night." She said firmly.</b></p><p>"<b>To-tomorrow?" Dr. Tofu asked in fright. "Ow." He exclaimed when Nodoka slapped him again.</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>I'm to do what?" Kasumi's normally calm voice broke in disbelief. "Auntie, I couldn't."</b><p>"<b>You will if you wish to get anywhere with your Doctor." Nodoka replied firmly. "It doesn't need to be a hard slap, just hard enough to get his attention."</b></p><p>"<b>I couldn't." kasumi protested. "I couldn't slap anyone."</b></p><p><b>Nodoka snorted. "You'll just have to get over that Kasumi dear." Suddenly Nodoka smiled. "I have an idea." She said. "You'll practice."</b></p><p>"<b>Practice?" Kasumi echoed nervously.</b></p><p>"<b>Genma." Called Nodoka. "Get over here."</b></p><p><b>Genma looked up from his game of Shogi. "Now?" He looked over to where Nodoka was standing. He took in the look on her face and slowly got to his feet. "Excuse me Soun." He said ."Coming No-chan." He sighed. He walked over to Nodoka. "Yes?"</b></p><p>"<b>Just stand there." Nodoka directed. She turned to Kasumi. "Now look, it's easy." She turned around and slapped Genma.</b></p><p>"<b>Ow." Genma complained. "What did you do that for?"</b></p><p>"<b>Never you mind." Nodoka replied tartly. "Now you do it, Kasumi dear."</b></p><p><b>Kasumi cringed slightly under Nodoka's glare. "Auntie?" She whispered. "Are you sure this is the right thing to do?" Nodoka folded her arms. Kasumi swallowed and walked over to Genma. Her hand trembled as she swung it softly against Genma's face.</b></p><p>"<b>That was pitiful." Nodoka said cooly. "Do it again but harder this time."</b></p><p>"<b>No-chan." Protested Genma.</b></p><p>"<b>Shut up Husband." Nodoka snapped. "Go ahead Kasumi."</b></p><p><b>Kasumi swung her arm and slapped Genma softly.</b></p><p>"<b>Again." Directed Nodoka. "This time think of all the food my ungrateful husband has eaten."</b></p><p><b>Kasumi swung hard enough to this time make a sound when her hand connected with Genma's face.</b></p><p>"<b>Again." Directed Nodoka. "The koi pond."</b></p><p><b>This time the sound of Kasumi's hand hitting Genma's face was sharper. </b></p><p>"<b>Again." Directed Nodoka. "The broken furo." Kasumi slapped. "The broken walls in the dojo." Kasumi slapped harder. "The times he got your father drunk." Kasumi slapped harder. "His treatment of Ranma." Kasumi slapped even harder. "All the money you've wasted on him." Suddenly it seemed if something broke in Kasumi and she started slapping Genma over and over. The sound of the slaps brought Soun into the room. </b></p><p>"<b>I think she's got it." He observed.</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Dr. Tofu nervously approached the Tendo front door. "Hello." He called. He entered and bent down to take off his shoes. When he stood, Kasumi was standing in front of him. Ono's glasses steamed up. "K-kasumi. Hee hee. Fancy meeting you here." Kasumi slapped him hard enough to knock the glasses off the doctor's face. "Kasumi?"</b><p>"<b>I've had enough of this foolishness." Kasumi said in a voice that sounded more like Nodoka's then the normally mild tone she usually affected. "Now you get in there and sit down."</b></p><p>"<b>Yes Kasumi." Dr. Tofu swallowed and walked into the main room. Seated at the table were Nodoka, Soun and Genma. Genma face, Ono noted, seemed extremely swollen and red. Ono sat down. </b></p><p>"<b>Hello Doctor." Greeted Nodoka. "Right on time." She said in approval.</b></p><p>"<b>Hello everyone. Thank you for inviting me to dinner." Dr. Tofu replied. "Mr Saotome." He said in concern. "What happened to your face?"</b></p><p>"<b>Training." Grumbled Genma. Kasumi walked out of the kitchen carrying a platter and Genma flinched. </b></p><p><b>Kasumi placed the platter on the table and then sat down next to the Doctor. The Doctor's glasses began to fog up again. Kasumi slapped him. "Behave yourself." Kasumi ordered.</b></p><p><b>Ono swallowed nervously. "Yes dear."</b></p><p><b>Nodoka smiled in approval.</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma sat down in the chair and looked nervously at the woman sitting in the chair opposite her. A thick plate of plastic separated the two. "Hi Mom."</b><p>"<b>You look thin." Nodoka said. "Aren't they feeding you enough?"</b></p><p><b>Ranma shrugged. "Yeah, but the food isn't all that good." Ranma smiled slightly. "I think I've been spoiled by you an Kasumi."</b></p><p><b>Nodoka smiled. "That's very kind of you my son."</b></p><p>"<b>Who's bein kind? You know you're a damn good cook." Ranma replied fiercely. She leaned forward. "They listen in on these conversations ya know."</b></p><p>"<b>How rude." Nodoka looked around then decided on glaring at the ceiling. She returned her gaze to Ranma. "So Daughter," Nodoka smiled slightly. "This is the last place I expected to find you. Though considering your Father's past I guess it was inevitable." She sighed. "No, that's not true. Your actions were very man," Nodoka broke off. "Honorable." She corrected.</b></p><p>"<b>Thanks Mom." Ranma peered behind Nodoka. "Speakin' of Pops." Ranma said. "Is he here?"</b></p><p><b>Nodoka snorted. "I felt, under the circumstances, that it would be best if your father not miss a day of work."</b></p><p>"<b>Work?" Ranma exclaimed in disbelief. "Pops is working?" An evil grin came to the red heads face. "As what, circus clown?"</b></p><p><b>Nodoka laughed. "That would be appropriate." She said. "No, your Father is working as a construction worker." The grin that appeared on Nodoka's face matched Ranma's. "The foreman is the husband of a friend of mine. I gave him permission to apply whatever incentives he thought necessary to get a full days work out of him." Ranma laughed. Nodoka watched as the lines of tension eased off of her, sometimes, daughter's face. "Now I only have short time to speak to you and I certainly don't want to waste it talking about your Father." Nodoka placed her hand against the transparent barrier. After a moment, Ranma placed her hand against the plastic as well. "I'm very proud of you." Nodoka said quietly. "It's good to know at least one Saotome knows the meaning of honor." She smiled at Ranma's expression. "Oh yes, I know exactly why you're doing this." She said. "I approve."</b></p><p><b>Ranma swallowed a lump that appeared in her throat. "Thanks Mom." Ranma stared into his mother's eyes and found only love. </b></p><p>"<b>Oh now some good news." Nodoka said. "Kasumi and Dr. Tofu are engaged." For some reason Nodoka giggled. "Kasumi didn't come today because she and Ono need some time together."</b></p><p>"<b>That's great." Ranma said cheerfully. "I never thought the two of them would ever get together."</b></p><p>"<b>Well." Nodoka said. "Kasumi finally took matters into her own hands." Nodoka giggled again. Then Nodoka's expression sobered. "Now before my time is up I want to tell you something." Nodoka blew out a breath. "Ukyo is here." Her hand rose to stop Ranma from speaking. "I still don't know what we can do to make up for your father's ill considered actions but I want you to be kind to her."</b></p><p>"<b>You know I will Mom." Ranma grimaced. "Sometimes I wish I were twins."</b></p><p>"<b>You do care for Ukyo, don't you?" Nodoka smiled at Ranma's nod. </b></p><p>"<b>Good." A guard approached. "It seems my time is nearly up." Nodoka stood. "Until next week."</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>Hi Akane." Ukyo said hesitantly.</b><p>"<b>Ukyo." Akane replied coolly. </b></p><p><b>The two young women stared at each other without speaking for a long time. Finally Ukyo dropped her eyes. "How is he?" She asked.</b></p><p>"<b>She, Ukyo, in here, it's she." Akane replied. "She's fine. She gets a little claustrophobic now and then but Ranko's doing fine." Akane stressed the 'Ranko'. Akane peered through the transparent barrier. "How are you doing?"</b></p><p>"<b>Well I'm not getting drunk every day anymore." Ukyo kept looking at her hands clasped on her lap.</b></p><p>"<b>That's good." Akane shook her head. "You had Ranm, Ranko worried." Akane frowned. "You had me worried as well." </b></p><p>"<b>Sorry Akane." Ukyo shrugged without looking up. "This is very difficult you know."</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah, I'm sure it is." Akane tapped the plastic causing Ukyo to look up. "I know you're going to talk to Ranma afterwards. I want you to do me a favor."</b></p><p>"<b>Favor?" Asked Ukyo. "What kind of favor?"</b></p><p>"<b>Nothing too hard." Akane replied. "Don't talk about me or the engagement. Okay?" Akane gave Ukyo a small smile. "Make her laugh if you can."</b></p><p><b>Ukyo returned Akane's smile. "I can do that." Ukyo gave a small almost sad laugh. "Can I flirt?"</b></p><p><b>Akane raised her hand and held her index finger and thumb about an inch apart. "About that much." She gave Ukyo a mock glare. "Just don't get carried away."</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>Ukyo!" Ranma cried. "Man it's good to see ya."</b><p>"<b>Hey Ran-chan." Ukyo replied. "Good to see you." Ukyo placed her elbows on the counter in front of her, then rested her chin on her clasped hands. "Cute outfit."</b></p><p><b>Ranma snorted. "Don't remind me." She tilted her head to one side. "You don't know how much I want a Ran-chan special right now."</b></p><p><b>Ukyo laughed. 'And here I thought I was supposed to cheer him up.' She thought to herself. Ukyo wiped her eyes. "Oh sugar, you don't know how much I would love to make one for you."</b></p><p><b>Ranma searched Ukyo's face. 'She looks tired.' Ranma decided. "You exercising?" Ranma asked in concern. "Getting enough sleep?"</b></p><p><b>Ukyo laughed ruefully. "Is it that obvious?" Ukyo rubbed the back of her head. "Exercising, yeah." She waggled her hands. "Sleeping, that's another story." Ukyo looked down slightly. "I get a little lonely. At night." Ukyo looked up. "Does Akane know about," She chewed her lower lip. "You know. Us?"</b></p><p>"<b>I think so." Ranma replied. "She never brought it up, so maybe not." Ranma smiled sheepishly. "Come to think of it, there was this time when she got really mad at me for no reason." Ranma pulled at her pigtail. "Maybe she had a reason after all."</b></p><p><b>Ukyo snorted. "That girl never really needed a reason to get mad at you." She shook her head. "That's not fair. She's really a good person." Ukyo leaned back. "God I wish I could hate her."</b></p><p>"<b>I'm kinda glad ya don't." Ranma replied seriously. "For a lot of reasons."</b></p><p>"<b>You were my first, you know." Ukyo said with a small smile. 'Only.' She added mentally.</b></p><p>"<b>So were you." Ranma replied with a similar smile. Ranma's smile fell slightly. "Sorry Uk-chan." She said. "I didn't mean to hurt you."</b></p><p>"<b>I know sugar." Ukyo replied. Ukyo gave a small laugh. "I can't believe we're having this conversation here.</b></p><p>"<b>Not like we had a chance before." Ranma smiled sheepishly. "To be honest I was afraid I'd chicken out."</b></p><p>"<b>Thought we'd just end up in bed again?" Ukyo asked. She batted her eyes at Ranma.</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah." Ranma replied. "I think that's exactly what I thought would happen."</b></p><p><b>Ukyo chuckled. "You're probably right." She shook her head. "Well that explains why you stayed away." Ukyo gave Ranma a sidelong look. "Still tempted?" She asked.</b></p><p>"<b>All the time Uk-chan." Ranma replied. "You're a hard woman to get over."</b></p><p><b>Ukyo snorted. "So're you." Ukyo smiled. To Ranma it was the most natural smile she's seen on the chef in a very long time. "For some reason I feel like I found my old friend again." She said. "It feels good."</b></p><p>"<b>It feels really good." Ranma replied.</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>Hello Daddy." Nabiki said quietly. </b><p><b>Soun Tendo looked at his middle daughter. To Nabiki's astonishment the Tendo patriarch bowed his head. "I'm sorry for failing you Daughter." Soun said. Tears leaked from his eyes as he sat back up. </b></p><p>"<b>I thought I was supposed to apologize to you." Nabiki said. "I'm the one in prison."</b></p><p>"<b>And I'm the one who forced you to break the law." The tears flowed from Soun's eyes. "I should be the one in prison, not the three of you." With obvious effort Soun got his emotions under control. He pounded his chest. "My fault." He cried. "Mine alone."</b></p><p>"<b>Daddy!" Nabiki cried. "You're embarrassing me." Nabiki rolled her eyes. Inside she was trying not to laugh. 'That's my Daddy.' She thought in amusement and, to her surprise, gratitude. She smiled as her father stopped crying as quickly as he had started. "That's better. Who's handling the bills?"</b></p><p>"<b>I've given the accounts to Kasumi as you instructed." Soun replied. "Don't worry Nabiki, the house is in good hands." He looked down at his own hands. "Any hands other than mine would be good hands." Soun sighed. "Kasumi wants me to start teaching again."</b></p><p>"<b>I think that would be a good idea." Nabiki replied. "Speaking of teaching, I met a former student of yours here. Does the name Yasuhara ring a bell?"</b></p><p>"<b>Yasuhara? Yasuhara." Soun rubbed his chin. Suddenly Soun raised a finger into the air. "Oh yes, Kiki Yasuhara."</b></p><p>"<b>Kiki?" Laughed Nabiki. "We talking about the same woman; built like a refrigerator, face like an old shoe?</b></p><p><b>Soun chuckled. "Sounds like Kiki." Soun pursed her lips. "Good student. Loves all forms of martial arts." Soun leaned forward. "She was one of my earlier students." Soun frowned slightly. "Right after Genma and I broke from the Old Master." Nabiki nodded then waved a hand encouragingly. "We weren't at our best then." Soun sighed. "My best came after I married your mother." Tears began to leak from Soun's eyes. "I miss her." Soun wiped his eyes. </b></p><p>"<b>I know Daddy." Nabiki replied in a soft voice. "I know."</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki walked over to the guard station. "Prisoner Nabiki Tendo to see Sargent Yasuhara." She announced.</b><p><b>The guard looked her over. "The Sarge said you'd be by." The guard said. "Funny you don't look like a hotshot martial artist." She said.</b></p><p>"<b>What makes you think I'm a martial artist?" Nabiki asked curiously. 'Let's see if I was right about this too.'</b></p><p>"<b>Because the Sarge said to give you a gi if you showed." The smile on the guards face was a combination of glee and pity. "Yasuhara makes it a point to interview," The way the guard said interview confirmed Nabiki's suspicions. "Anybody demonstrating an advanced level of skill."</b></p><p>'<b>Yep I was right.' She thought. 'Note to self, make sure neither Ranma nor Akane show off.' Nabiki fixed a smile on her face. "Well I really don't consider myself all that advanced, but I would mind testing myself against the Sargent."</b></p><p><b>The guard grinned. "That's exactly what Yasuhara had in mind."</b></p><p><b>Several minutes later Nabiki found herself dressed in an old gi and facing Sargent Yasuhara in a room obviously designed as a training hall. The Sargent grinned at Nabiki. "So Tendo, a little test of skill?" She started circling Nabiki. Nabiki kept her distance while she assessed the Sargent. </b></p><p>'<b>Strong.' Was her first assessment. 'Not as strong as Akane but I bet she's just as aggressive.' To test her theory she stopped circling and firmed her stance. Sargent Yasuhara charged. Nabiki swayed away from the fist and quickly raised a leg to block the followup kick. 'Yep.' She threw a quick jab. </b></p><p>"<b>Not bad Tendo." Yasuhara said dancing backwards. "I usually tag my opponents with that combo."</b></p><p>"<b>You should." Agreed Nabiki. "My dad likes it for the same reason." Nabiki threw a couple quick jabs and kicks to test Yasuhara's defense. 'I could take her.' Nabiki realized. 'Okay Nabs make this look good. Lose but make her work for it.'</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kimi Ota looked up from the magazine Nabiki had left on her bunk as Nabiki walked in. "How was your mat," Kimi broke off. "Oh shit." She exclaimed. She sprang off the top bunk and hurried over to Nabiki.</b><p>"<b>It looks worse than it is." Nabiki said but didn't refuse Kimi's assistance. Nabiki's lower lip was swollen and it looked like Nabiki was favoring one leg. "You should see Yasuhara." </b></p><p><b>Kimi pushed Nabiki on to her bunk and then raced over to the sink. She rinsed the rag there in cold water and wrung it out. "Put this over your lip." She commanded. Kimi rummaged under her pillow. "I knew I had some aspirin left." She said a moment later. She got a glass of water and handed it and a couple aspirin to Nabiki.</b></p><p>"<b>Thanks Kimi." Nabiki swallowed the pills gratefully.</b></p><p>"<b>Was it worth it?" Kimi asked curiously</b></p><p><b>Nabiki nodded. "Yeah, it was worth it." Nabiki grinned then flinched as pain shot through her swollen lip. "Yasuhara proved she is the tougher bitch." She said. "And I was properly convinced of it. Made her work for it though." She said proudly.</b></p><p>"<b>You threw the fight?" Kimi said in disbelief.</b></p><p><b>Nabiki nodded. "To be honest, I didn't have to fake it all that much. The woman is actually very good. Still, now she is convinced she can take me if I," Nabiki grinned. "Get out of line." Nabiki rubbed her leg. "Damn she kicks hard." Nabiki suddenly found herself pushed to the bunk.</b></p><p>"<b>Let me take a look at that." Kimi said. She started probing Nabiki's leg. "Nothing broken." She declared a moment later. "But you'd better take it easy for a couple days." She started gently massaging the bruised area. "Add massage oil to the list." She said after awhile.</b></p><p>"<b>Massage." Nabiki said longingly. "I would kill for a good massage."</b></p><p>"<b>Roll over." Kimi commanded. "I've had a little experience giving massages." She said. When Nabiki rolled over she started massaging Nabiki's neck and shoulders. In a minute Nabiki was purring.</b></p><p>"<b>A little experience, she said." Nabiki said. She groaned in pleasure as Kimi worked out a kink in her shoulder. </b></p><p>"<b>Well I used to work in a couple massage parlors in order to make some quick money." Kimi confessed. "Mostly rub and tug places."</b></p><p>"<b>Rub and tug?" Asked Nabiki.</b></p><p>"<b>Massage and a hand job." Kimi explained. "Don't anyone ever tell you different, you have to know what you're doing if you want repeat business."</b></p><p>"<b>You were a prostitute?" Nabiki said in shock.</b></p><p>"<b>Hey." Kimi said defensively. "The money's good." She said. "I'd get half the cost of the massage plus tips." Kimi chuckled. "Regulars always tip better than someone off the street." Kimi continued to work on Nabiki. "And I never put out unless I wanted to."</b></p><p>"<b>I didn't know you had a choice." Nabiki said in surprise.</b></p><p>"<b>That's the difference between working in a massage parlor and working in a brothel." Kimi replied. "The guys who'd come into a massage parlor actually wanted a massage. It's no big deal jerking a guy off. Heck it barely counts as sex." Nabiki joined Kimi in laughing.</b></p><p>"<b>Is that how you got in here?" Nabiki asked curiously.</b></p><p>"<b>Nah." Kimi replied. "Well not exactly. I had this customer that wanted more than I was willing to give. God he was a real pig. I didn't even want to work on him but no one else was available."</b></p><p>"<b>What happened?"</b></p><p>"<b>I may not be in your league." Kimi replied and Nabiki could hear the confidence in her voice. "But I can handle myself. Anyway he tried to force himself on me and I defended myself." Kimi chuckled. "I was a bit forceful."</b></p><p>"<b>Good for you." Nabiki said seriously.</b></p><p>"<b>Thanks." Kimi started working down Nabiki's spine. "Anyway it turned out he was related to some mucky muck and, well here I am."</b></p><p>'<b>Would you have changed what you did if you knew who he was?" Asked Nabiki.</b></p><p>"<b>Nope." Kimi replied.</b></p><p>"<b>Good." Nabiki arched her back slightly as Kimi started on her lower spine. "The money was that good?" Nabiki asked.</b></p><p>"<b>Good enough to pay for my apartment and my mom's." Kimi replied. "Plus I was able to put some money aside for a rainy day. Mostly long term bonds."</b></p><p>"<b>You don't get much of a return that way." Nabiki replied. "Oh yeah, right there." Nabiki pillowed her head on her arms. "You have to make your money work for you." Nabiki warmed up to her favorite topic; money. 'Hmm.' Nabiki thought. 'Long term bonds, means she has a good chunk of change.' Nabiki turned her head. "If I were you, I'd have my own business. Find out what people want and get it."</b></p><p>"<b>Well that is sort of what I was doing, wasn't it?" Kimi replied with a laugh. She started working her way back up Nabiki's spine. "But I guess that wasn't what you meant."</b></p><p>"<b>I don't know." Nabiki replied seriously. "I mean sex is a commodity. I just never really considered it before." Nabiki snorted. "I ran a numbers racket and point shaving scheme. Who am I to judge?"</b></p><p>"<b>Good money?" Kimi asked. </b></p><p>"<b>Oh yeah." Nabiki replied. "Kept the roof over our heads at any rate." Nabiki gave a small laugh. 'Damn, I really like this woman. We're so alike.'</b></p><p><b>Kimi smiled as she continued her massage. "I hope you don't take this the wrong way." Kimi said after awhile. "But I think you're very attractive."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki was silent for a long moment, then she sighed. "I was wondering when you'd say something like that." She said "I told you I don't swing that way."</b></p><p>"<b>Maybe I should stop then." Kimi said with a touch of disappointment in her voice.</b></p><p>"<b>Don't you dare." Nabiki commanded. </b></p><p><b>Kimi giggled at Nabiki's tone and continued massaging. Then her face turned serious. "You going to trust me after what I just said?" She asked.</b></p><p>"<b>Why shouldn't I?" Nabiki replied. "All you said was that you found me attractive. How could I object to that?"</b></p><p>"<b>You know what I meant." Kimi responded with a touch of annoyance in her voice.</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah, I did." Nabiki turned her head toward the wall. "They called me the Ice Queen in High School." She said softly. "I never, the boys wouldn't, I think I scared the boys off." She finished slightly incoherently.</b></p><p><b>Kimi's massage became softer, almost a caress. "Bummer." She said. "Well, what do you expect from boys?" She asked. "When what you needed was a man."</b></p><p>"<b>I think I scared them off too." Nabiki replied. </b></p><p>"<b>You are not going to lie there and tell me you're a virgin are you?" Kimi asked. Nabiki hesitated then nodded slightly. "Oh my." Kimi said. "So what did you do when you got horny?" Nabiki raised her hand and wiggled it. Kimi giggled. "Well that does work." Her hands started kneading the tops of Nabiki's buttocks. Nabiki wriggled. "Good spot, huh?" Kimi shifted downwards slightly. "Between you and me, it's better when someone else does it."</b></p><p>"<b>So I heard." Nabiki mumbled. 'I can't believe I'm doing this.' She thought to herself. Her legs spread slightly at the pressure of Kimi's hands. "I always thought I was straight." She muttered.</b></p><p>"<b>Straight, gay." Kimi replied. "They're just words. If it makes you feel any better, I still like men."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki turned her head. "Then why?"</b></p><p>"<b>You see any men here?" Kimi asked. "I'm going to be here for two years. That's a long time without a man."</b></p><p>"<b>I wouldn't know." Nabiki replied.</b></p><p><b>Kimi stopped massaging. "Roll over." She said. When Nabiki rolled over, Kimi lay down next to her. "I like you chief." Kimi said. "You're smart, attractive and tough." Her face was close to Nabiki's. "I like tough women." Her hand raised and stroked Nabiki's cheek. "I could be good to you, if you'll let me."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki swallowed nervously. She looked into Kimi's eyes. "I think I like tough women too." Nabiki said finally. "You're going to have to show me." She said a moment later. "I don't know what to do."</b></p><p>"<b>Don't worry chief; I think you're going to be a natural." Kimi said softly. She leaned closer and pressed her lips softly against Nabiki's. "Well?" She said when she broke the kiss.</b></p><p>"<b>Do that again." Nabiki said. "I need to check something."</b></p><p><b>Kimi grinned and pressed her lips against Nabiki's again. This time she let her tongue emerge from her mouth and press against Nabiki's lips. Nabiki opened her mouth slightly and sucked on Kimi's tongue. Nabiki felt her breath start coming faster. She broke the kiss and pulled away from Kimi.</b></p><p>"<b>Do you want to stop?" Kimi said trying to hide her disappointment. She smiled when Nabiki shook her head. "Then why'd you pull away?"</b></p><p>"<b>I didn't think I'd like it so much." Nabiki said. She stared at Kimi wide-eyed. "It scared me." She admitted reluctantly.</b></p><p>"<b>Wanna try again Chief?" She said with a giggle.</b></p><p>"<b>On two conditions." Nabiki replied in her best Ice Queen tones. "Let's take it a little slower." </b></p><p><b>Kimi nodded. "No problem, slow is better anyway." She replied. "What's the second condition?"</b></p><p>"<b>I like my friends to call me Nabs." Nabiki said with a blush.</b></p><p><b>Kimi smiled and cupped Nabiki's cheek in her hand. "I would very much like to call you Nabs."</b></p><p>"<b>Oh shut up and kiss me again." Nabiki said.</b></p><p><b>End Chapter 3</b></p><p><b>Authors Notes: I'll let this one stand on its own without comment.</b></p>
