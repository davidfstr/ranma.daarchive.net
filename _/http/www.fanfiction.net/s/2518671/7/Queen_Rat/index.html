</div><p>Author's notes: Well if the AN is at the top of the page it means 'read it'. Lime warning: Even edited this chapter contains some sexual content and coarse language. There is also a lemon version of this scene available. It is graphic and violent. What happens in the missing section is explained at the beginning of chapter 8. For some people I think it would be best to pass on requesting the uncut version. ANY requests for the lemon must be by email and affirm you are at least eighteen years of age. No exceptions.</p><p>I mean it.</p><p>Sarge</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>'Night moves'</p><p>Ukyo Kuonji entered the restaurant that had become her meeting place with Ranma and Akane. "Hey Jimmu." She called to the night chef. "How's it going?"</p><p>"Quiet." The night chef replied. "Your girl friends showing tonight?" He grinned. "You are one lucky guy. Two beautiful women. One day you're going to have to let me in on your secret." Jimmu leaned closer. "That brunette is hecka cute but the redhead." He held his hands cupped in front of his chest. "Oh man, I'd love to see those."</p><p>Ukyo snorted. "You and about half the population of Tokyo." Ukyo replied. She grinned. "The male half."</p><p>"I dunno Ukyo." Jimmu replied. "I think my sister wouldn't mind seeing'em either." He whistled. "They can't be real."</p><p>"Trust me Jimmu, they're real." Ukyo shook her head in amusement. "Hey you mind if I borrow your grill. I promised Ranko I'd make her an okonomiyaki."</p><p>"Go ahead." Jimmu replied.</p><p>The bell over the door tinkled. Ukyo turned around. "Hey guys." She called. She pointed to the counter. "Have a seat. Jimmu said I can use his grill. One Ran-chan special coming up."</p><p>"Awright." Ranma crowed. She quickly sat down. "Hey Jimmu." She greeted the chef. She cupped her chin with her hands. "It's so sweet of you to let Ukyo use the grill." She said in her cutest voice.</p><p>"For you gorgeous." Jimmu replied. "Anytime." He leaned on the counter close to Ranma. "How come you always wear sweats? A pretty girl like you should show off what she's got." Jimmu looked at Akane. "You too. I bet you're both knockouts when you're dressed up."</p><p>"Flattery will get you everywhere." Akane gave Jimmu her best smile. "Maybe one day, if you're very, very good, we'll dress up for you."</p><p>"Yeah, you should see Akane's legs." Ranma whistled. "I'd kill for legs like hers."</p><p>Akane flushed in pleasure at the praise. "Thank you Ranko," Akane caught Ukyo's eye. "It's all Ukyo's fault." Akane said with a grin. "He gets so jealous."</p><p>"If you were my girls, I'd never let you go out dressed like that." Jimmu turned to Ukyo. "Come on man, have a heart."</p><p>Ukyo slid an Okonomiyaki each in front of Ranma and Akane. "Stop flirting with Jimmu." Ukyo mock growled. "Eat your okonomiyaki."</p><p>"See I told you he gets jealous." Akane cracked.</p><p>"I can't believe you're making them wear sweats." Jimmu complained. "If I were you, ladies, I'd dump him."</p><p>"I dunno." Ranma said between mouthfuls. "Ukyo's got his good points."</p><p>"He must." Jimmu chuckled. "You are one lucky dude." Jimmu said again. The bell over the door tinkled again. Jimmu looked up. "Customers."</p><p>Ukyo looked at the two men who entered the restaurant. "Jimmu, if I were you, I'd go disappear for awhile." Ukyo looked at Ranma and Akane. "It's them." She said quietly. "The guys from Uk-chan's."</p><p>"What's going on?" Jimmu's voice was suddenly nervous.</p><p>"Trust me." Ukyo said. "You don't want to be here." Ukyo slid her giant spatula out of it's holder on her back.</p><p>Jimmu looked at the spatula then at Ukyo. "You're Yakusa aren't you."</p><p>Ukyo shook her head. "No. But they are." Ukyo pointed to the floor. "If you won't leave then stay down. You're a good guy and I don't want you to get hurt."</p><p>Jimmu nodded jerkily and then lay down on the floor behind the counter. He covered his head with his hands. Suddenly there was an eruption of sound. Gunshots. Screams, and the sound of flesh meeting flesh. Jimmu's curiosity got the better of him and he peeked over the counter. His eyes widened in disbelief as he watched the redhead charge right into the path of the gunmen. Somehow the bullets kept missing her. The redhead seemed to be in several places at once. The brunette started throwing what looked like fire from her hands and Ukyo was throwing little spatula shaped blades. Jimmu ducked back behind the counter. Then there was silence.</p><p>"You can come out now Jimmu." Ukyo called.</p><p>Jimmu got to his knees and peeked over the counter again. The two gunmen were pinned to the wall by a number of the spatula shaped blades that Ukyo had been throwing. The redhead was quickly going through each of the men's pockets. Ukyo and the brunette were standing off to one side talking quietly.</p><p>Ranma walked over to the counter holding the men's wallets. "I figured these guys would carry cash." Ranma said. "Here Jimmu." Ranma tossed a wad of bills on the counter. "This should pay for any damages."</p><p>Jimmu swallowed nervously. "What?" Jimmu swallowed again. "What was that?" He didn't pick up the money.</p><p>"Nothing much." Ranma replied easily. "Give Akane and me ten minutes before you call the cops. Okay?"</p><p>Jimmu nodded rapidly. "Sure. No problem." He stammered.</p><p>Ranma arched her back and stretched. "Now that was a decent workout." She said happily. "Just like old times, eh Uk-chan?"</p><p>Ukyo grinned. "Just like." She agreed. She turned to Akane and raised an eyebrow. "You mind?"</p><p>"Yeah I do." Akane grumped. "But go ahead."</p><p>Ukyo crooked a finger at Ranma. "C'mere Ran-chan." When Ranma walked over Ukyo swept the redhead into her arms and gave her a very passionate kiss.</p><p>Akane grumbled to herself as the kiss seemed to go on endlessly. "Okay that's enough." She said finally. "That's more than enough."</p><p>Ukyo released a dazed looking Ranma. "Just getting her warmed up for you sugar." Ukyo said easily. Ukyo spun Ranma around and swatted the redhead on the butt. "Go to momma Ran-chan." Ukyo said with a grin. "Same time next week?" She asked Akane.</p><p>"Yeah. Yeah." Akane replied testily. A crooked grin came to her face. "I don't think I'm going to get much sleep tonight." She half complained.</p><p>"Well if she's too much for you," Ukyo said suggestively. She ducked as Akane swung at her. Ukyo laughed. "Later guys." The bell over the door tinkled and they were gone. "Just like old times." Ukyo said happily.</p><p>The next morning a grumpy looking Ranma and an irritated looking Akane walked into Nabiki's cell. Ranma threw the two wallets she took off the Yakusa to Nabiki. "You might find these interestin'." Ranma told Nabiki. "We took'em off the two goons Ukyo told us about." Ranma rapidly filled Nabiki on the events of the previous evening.</p><p>"A break at last." Kimi breathed.</p><p>"Good job guys." Nabiki said in approval. "Speaking of Ukyo, I need her to get something for us."</p><p>"Sure." Akane replied. "We're not seeing her for another week though."</p><p>"That's okay." Nabiki smiled in a way that made Ranma nervous. "In the meantime, you have some deliveries to make tonight." She handed Ranma a list. Nabiki eyed Ranma curiously. "You don't look happy." She said. "What's the matter?" Ranma muttered something. "What? I didn't get that."</p><p>"Ranko started her period last night." Akane supplied. The irritated look on her face increased. "Stop making such a big deal about it."</p><p>"If you had periods like mine," Ranma shot back. "You wouldn't talk that way."</p><p>Nabiki choked back a laugh. 'Damn I keep forgetting how complete the change is.' She shook her head. Nabiki reached under her mattress and pulled out a bottle. "Here Ranko." She tossed the bottle to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma grabbed the bottle. "Oh good. I forgot we got these." Ranma opened the bottle and extracted two tablets and swallowed them dry. "Stupid periods."</p><p>"I feel for you girl." Kimi said sympathetically. "Mine are pretty rough too. At least the first two days anyway."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Same here."</p><p>"Maybe you should let Akane do the deliveries tonight." Nabiki said a moment later. "Or better yet put it off until tomorrow."</p><p>"Could I?" Ranma replied. "I mean the Tomboy could do it, no problem, but I always feel better being with her."</p><p>The irritated look faded from Akane's face. "Tell you what Ranma." Akane said. "I'll just do half the list tonight." Akane walked over and put her arm around Ranma's waist. "That way I'll only be gone for a short time."</p><p>"You be careful." Ranma gave Akane a faint smile. "I'll wait up for you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane ran along the railings in the darkened hallways of the prison. Ranma had looked at the angles of the cameras that monitored each floor and determined where there were blind spots. 'You know for someone who keeps saying he isn't so smart, he can be brilliant when he wants to be.' Akane thought to herself. Akane jumped and grabbed the edge of the walkway above her as she navigated through an area that was under direct view of the cameras. Akane stopped and let go with one hand. She reached into the bag slung on her hip and extracted a box. She nodded. Akane then flipped around and hung by her feet. 'Yep Cell 102.' She tossed the box through the narrow opening. 'Score.' Akane exulted and raised her arms over her head. 'Well that was the last one.' She said in satisfaction. 'Better head back before Ranma worries.'<p>In a feat of both strength and flexibility, Akane flipped again and grabbed the walkway with her hands. She was about to lever herself up when she heard approaching footsteps. 'Shit.' She thought. 'They never make rounds at this hour.' The thought made Akane narrow her eyes. Using her immense strength and the skills Ranma had drilled into her. Akane clung tightly to the ceiling to wait. She didn't wait long as two guards approached.</p><p>Akane didn't recognize either of the guards. 'I thought I knew every guard here.' Akane's eyes narrowed even further. 'This doesn't smell right.' Akane silently followed the guards hanging underneath the walkway. They traveled through the prison and upwards until they reached the sixth floor. The guards walked along until they came to a particular cell. As Akane watched the two guards opened the door.. The guards entered and the cell door closed behind them. Akane thought a moment then retraced her path back down to the second floor and her own cell. Akane knocked and the cell slid open and Akane squeezed inside.</p><p>"Where have you been?" Ranma demanded. "I was getting worried."</p><p>"Something came up." Akane replied. She quickly filled Ranma in on what she observed. "Ranma I didn't recognize either of them." She said at the end. "I'm not even sure they were really guards."</p><p>"Did you get a look inside the cell?" Ranma asked. Akane shook her head. "Why not?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Without you there, are you crazy?" Akane replied shortly. "You've yelled at me enough times for jumping in without looking first." Akane suddenly found herself on the receiving end of an Amazonian style glomp. "Can't breathe." She gasped. Ranma released her. Akane ducked her head. "So?" She said. "I did good?"</p><p>"You did real good Tomboy." Ranma replied. "Get some sleep."</p><p>"Can I get a cuddle?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Baby you can get as many cuddles as you want." Ranma grinned. "But you still need to get some sleep."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Cell 511?" Yasuhara asked with a touch of skepticism in her voice. "Are you sure you got the cell number right?"<p>"I got it right." Akane replied. "Why?"</p><p>"Because there isn't supposed to be anyone in cell 511, that's why." Yasuhara replied. The prison guard leaned against the cell door. Her head bowed in thought. After a minute she looked up. "No. You have to be mistaken."</p><p>"Not at all Yasuhara." Nabiki interjected. "Think about it, it's the last place you'd look." Nabiki nodded to herself. "Clever, clever, clever." She muttered. "Look we know at least one guard is involved, right?" Yasuhara nodded. "Who had monitor duty last night?"</p><p>"Last night?" Yasuhara rubbed her chin. "Kasamoto and," Yasuhara frowned. "Tanaka."</p><p>"Kimi?" Nabiki turned in her chair. "What do we know about them?"</p><p>Kimi leafed through a notebook she held in her lap. She grunted. "Not as much as we should Nabs." Kimi replied. "In fact they're two of the people we red flagged." Kimi looked at her notes. "Both were assigned here at about the same time. Both never worked in a corrections facility before and both have some very odd gaps in their work history."</p><p>Nabiki rubbed her hands together. "It's all starting to make sense." She said in satisfaction. "Not one, but four guards."</p><p>"At least four." Interjected Kimi.</p><p>"Agreed, at least four." Nabiki pulled at her earlobe as she thought. "Definitely at least four. I'd guess two teams. Each one taking turns. One team does monitor duty while the second team distributes the goods. Then they switch."</p><p>"You think they're living in Cell 511?' Yasuhara said in surprise. "Shit! That makes more sense then I like." Yasuhara growled. "They'd be virtually invisible."</p><p>"Exactly." Nabiki shook her head. "The team on guard duty goes out picks up the drugs and comes back in."</p><p>"No way." Yasuhara disagreed. "They're always screened before coming back on duty."</p><p>"Three teams?" Kimi said in surmise. "One team brings it in, the same team on monitor duty, a second team for distribution and the third team as gatekeepers."</p><p>"Bigger than that Kimi." Nabiki said in a voice of sudden understanding. "This facility becomes the central distribution hub for all of Japan. It's too elaborate for a petty operation."</p><p>"Ukyo was right." Akane said in an aside to Ranma. Ranma nodded. Akane turned to Nabiki.. "What's the plan?"</p><p>"Sarge?" Nabiki looked at Yasuhara. The prison guard just made a 'go on' motion with her hands. Nabiki nodded. "This is big." Nabiki tapped her chin with a finger. "Busting the jerks on the inside is not enough. We have to get the supplier."</p><p>"That's going to be a problem." Yasuhara protested. "Whoever it is, is not here. The shit heads in 511 are just low level. The big boys are on the outside."</p><p>"I know that Sarge." Nabiki replied with a touch of annoyance. "I'm trying to figure out how to get them here, or at least close by." Nabiki thought for a while. "If we break the ring inside, they'll probably just relocate to another facility."</p><p>"Probably." Kimi said. "But it sure should piss them off." Kimi rubbed the bridge of her nose in a way very reminiscent of Nabiki. "I wonder if it would piss them off enough?"</p><p>"Ooh." Nabiki breathed in appreciation. "I like the way you think." Nabiki laughed evilly. "I got it. Don't bust them. Just keep taking their supply."</p><p>"I kinda like it." Ranma said. "But only kinda." Ranma grabbed the end of her pigtail and looked at it. "They'll get pissed alright, but," Ranma broke off and looked at Akane. "We ain't enough."</p><p>"The NWC is broken up Ranko." Akane replied. "Mousse and Shampoo are back in China, who knows where Ryoga is, all that's left." Akane broke off. "Oh no. We are not involving Ukyo."</p><p>"She's already involved remember?" Ranma replied. "Those jerks got a good look at her. It's only a matter of time before their bosses know." Ranma spread her hands. "We gotta at least let her know what's gonna go down."</p><p>"Yeah. Yeah." Akane grumped. "How about Konatsu?" She shook her head. "Never mind. He's a total flake."</p><p>Ranma shrugged a shoulder in reluctant agreement. "Now I'm kinda worried about Uk-chan." Ranma said moodily. "I gotta call her, let her know." She looked at Yasuhara. "Let me borrow your cell phone." Yasuhara hesitated for a moment then tossed her cell phone to Ranma. "Thanks." Ranma dialed Ukyo's number. "Uk-chan?" She said when the phone answered. "Yeah, it's me. I'm using someone's cell so we won't be overheard." Ranma paused as Ukyo said something. "Smart girl. I knew you'd figure it out but I wanted to call to make sure." Ranma laughed. "Yeah, me too." Ranma expression sobered. "Watch your back Uk-chan. Don't take any chances okay?" Ranma nodded. "Yeah, we're still on." Ranma again smiled at something Ukyo said. "Yeah me too." Ranma's expression softened. "Later Uk-chan." Ranma hung up. "Okay she already figured it out." She tossed the phone back to Yasuhara.</p><p>"Good." Nabiki crossed her legs and then her arms. Her head bowed as she thought. "Okay." She said finally. "We have a plan. Let's see what happens."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hey Uk-chan." Ranma greeted the chef as she and Akane entered the all night ramen house.<p>"Hey sugar." Ukyo gave a low wolf whistle. "Nice outfits you guys."</p><p>"Now that's the way you two should dress." Jimmu called from the grill. Jimmu eyed the pair with appreciation. The redhead was wearing tight pants and a midriff baring t-shirt and Jimmu was sure she wasn't wearing a bra. The brunette was wearing a baggy sweatshirt but the 'daisy dukes' more than made up for it. "Damn you do have fine legs."</p><p>Akane smiled. "Why thank you Jimmu." Akane turned to Ukyo. "Kimi was able to get us these. Ukyo, she's nearly as scary as my sister."</p><p>Ukyo snorted. "That's saying something." Ukyo spread her arms. "Give Daddy a hug." She said. Akane and Ranma hurried over to Ukyo and let the chef wrap them both in her arms. Ukyo cupped Akane's butt for a second.</p><p>Hidden by Ukyo's arms Akane jabbed Ukyo in the ribs."Getting a little carried away huh Ukyo." Akane whispered.</p><p>"Got to keep up appearances." Ukyo replied in the same tone. "You know what Jimmu thinks."</p><p>"Damn you're one lucky dude." Jimmu said in a voice thick with envy.</p><p>"See?" Ukyo laughed. Ukyo released Akane but kept an arm around Ranma's waist. Ukyo looked at Ranma. "She treating you right?' She asked. Ranma nodded. Ukyo nodded back and walked Ranma over to the counter. Akane followed. The three sat down at the counter with Ranma between her and Ukyo. Jimmu walked over from the grill and leaned on the counter right opposite Ranma.</p><p>"I see ya got the place patched up." Ranma remarked. "Looks good." Ranma leaned closer to Jimmu. "My eyes are up here Jimmu." Ranma said as she pointed to her face. Ranma giggled.</p><p>"Sorry Ranko." Jimmu blushed.</p><p>"It's okay, Jimmu." Ranma replied with a smile. "I'm used to it."</p><p>"You mean you like it." Akane said. "Ranko is an incorrigible exhibitionist." Akane explained. "Sometimes we have to remind her to wear clothes."</p><p>Ranma stretched her arms over her head exposing part of her bare breasts. "Clothes are such a pain." She said in a sultry voice.</p><p>Jimmu grabbed his nose. "Excuse me." He raced away.</p><p>"That was mean Ran-chan." Ukyo said. "But effective." She looked to where Jimmu had run off to. "He wont be back for a few minutes." Ukyo turned back to Ranma and Akane. "It's been quiet for the last couple weeks. No suspicious characters. No nothing."</p><p>"Maybe they haven't figured out who you are yet." Akane suggested. She shrugged. "Maybe they're stupider than we thought."</p><p>"Maybe." Ukyo said in a dubious tone. "How's it going on your end?"</p><p>"We've taken the last two shipments." Ranma said cheerfully. "Drugs are getting pretty scarce right now." Ranma's grin got wider. "Considering the amount we took from them. Drugs are scarce all over Tokyo right now."</p><p>"Nabiki pegged it." Akane added. "They were using the prison to distribute drugs throughout Tokyo. She figures they'd bring it in to the prison and then ship it around inside prison vehicles. Dealing the drugs in the prison was probably just a sideline."</p><p>Ukyo nodded. "Makes sense." Ukyo's mouth twisted. "Which makes the silence so much more puzzling."</p><p>Ranko pulled at her pigtail. "Yeah, but don't drop your guard. Okay?"</p><p>"Don't worry, I won't." Ukyo replied seriously.</p><p>"I do worry Uk-chan." Ranma said. "The only backup you got is Konatsu. He's a damn good martial artist but, as Akane puts it, he's a total flake." Ranma looked at Akane. Akane grimaced but nodded. "I'd feel a lot better if you stayed close by for awhile." Ranma looked at the end of her pigtail. "I was wondering if you'd consider staying here for the next couple weeks."</p><p>"I got a business to run Ran-chan." Ukyo replied. "Not that it isn't tempting, but I got to pay the bills."</p><p>Akane pulled an envelope out of the confines of her baggy sweat shirt. "Will this cover the next two weeks?" She asked. "I'm not thrilled with having you this close, but I'm less thrilled about you being in danger." Akane smiled sourly at Ukyo's expression. "Yeah. Yeah. We're rivals and all that but you're still Ranma's friend. And mine."</p><p>"Thanks Akane." Ukyo looked at the contents of the envelope. "Business has been good, I see." She looked at the empty grill. "Maybe Jimmu will let me work a shift."</p><p>"That's the idea." Ranma said happily. "Hey did you get Nabiki's order?" Ranma looked at the suddenly blushing face of Ukyo. "What did I say?"</p><p>"It's in my room." Ukyo said in a whisper. She looked at Akane. "Was it your idea?"</p><p>"Was what my idea?' Akane's face showed her confusion. "Nabs didn't tell us what she wanted. She just gave me the list to give to you."</p><p>"You didn't look at the list?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Nabiki said not to." Akane replied. "Sometimes it's better to listen to her."</p><p>Ukyo stood. "Come with me." Ukyo led them out of the restaurant and into the motel proper. Ukyo's room was on the second floor of the two story structure. She opened the door and waved Ranma and Akane in.</p><p>"Man, I think our cell is bigger." Ranma said in disgust.</p><p>"Not quite." Akane looked around. "But close." The room was small. Barely large enough for the single bed and a dresser. An old beat up television sat on the dresser.</p><p>Ukyo walked to the dresser and opened a drawer. She pulled out a cardboard box about a foot square. Ukyo brought the box over to the bed. "This is so not the right place to show you." Ukyo said. She sighed. "But, oh hell." Ukyo opened the box.</p><p>Akane looked in the box. Her eyes widened. "Oh my." She gasped. "Are those what I think they are?"</p><p>"What's in the box? What's in the box?" Ranma asked in excitement. She pushed herself past Akane and looked. "Eep." She squeaked as her ears turned as red as her hair.</p><p>"You sure this wasn't your idea?" Ukyo asked Akane. Akane shook her head rapidly. "You have no idea what I went through getting them." Ukyo continued. "I was never so embarrassed in my life."</p><p>"Didn't stop you from getting them." Akane observed. She looked in the box again. "Oh my, that one looks just like Ranma's."</p><p>Ukyo snorted. "That's why I got it." She admitted with a blush. "Oops." Ukyo said once she realized what she had said. "I mean."</p><p>Akane waved her off. "It's okay Ukyo, I already know you slept with Ranma." Akane blew out a breath. "Dying has a way of putting things into perspective, you know what I mean?" Akane reached into the box and took out one of the items. "Damn it really does look just like Ranma's." She held the object in front of her.</p><p>"Me?" Ranma squeaked. "I'm not that big."</p><p>"Oh yes you are." Akane and Ukyo chorused. "Even got the color the same." Ukyo continued. Ukyo swallowed. "It comes with a harness." Ukyo giggled nervously. "You know, so you can wear it."</p><p>"Wear it?" Echoed Ranma. She licked her suddenly dry lips. "Why would you wear it?" Suddenly Ranma's eyes widened. "Oh." Ranma looked between Akane and Ukyo then back at the object Akane was holding. She moaned.</p><p>"You okay Ran-chan?" Ukyo asked in concern. Ukyo gave Ranma a penetrating look. "I thought this was what you wanted. I thought you wanted Akane to, oh lord how do I say this?" She shook her head to clear her thoughts. She looked at Akane. "Tell him Akane."</p><p>"Me?" Squeaked Akane. "I'm not using that." She declared hotly. "That thing."</p><p>"Oh yes you are." Ukyo snapped in a suddenly angry voice. "Either you do or I will."</p><p>"What?" Shrieked Akane. "Oh no Ukyo. You keep your hands off, she's mine."</p><p>"Only if you treat her right." Ukyo shot back. She held up the dildo. "This." She said. "This is treating her right." Ukyo glared at Akane. "You know it and I know it."</p><p>"Ranma wants no part of that." Akane growled.</p><p>"No?" Ukyo replied in a suddenly calm voice. "You think so?" She said. "Watch." She turned to the still stunned looking Ranma. "Open your mouth Ran-chan." She cooed. She held the dildo against Ranma's mouth. "Open your mouth." She repeated.</p><p>To Akane's astonishment Ranma opened her mouth. Ukyo placed the dildo in the redhead's mouth. "R-ranma?"</p><p>"Good girl." Ukyo said in approval. "You want this don't you?" Ukyo moved the dildo in and out of Ranma's mouth slowly. "You want to feel this inside you. Don't you?" Ukyo took the dildo out of Ranma's mouth and ran it slowly down Ranma's body. "Take a good look Akane." Ukyo said. "Ranma would let me use this on her right now, wouldn't you baby?" Ranma nodded slowly.</p><p>"Ranma we're leaving." Akane almost screamed. "Now." She walked over to Ranma and pulled the redhead to her feet. Jerking Ranma out of her daze. "I can't believe you Ukyo." She snarled.</p><p>"Believe it Sugar." Ukyo snarled right back. She waved a finger under Akane's nose. "I'll keep my distance only as long as you give her what she needs. You screw up all bets are off." She said. "Got it?"</p><p>"Stop it." Ranma cried suddenly. "Stop it, just stop it." Without saying a word Ranma ran out the door.</p><p>"You better go after her." Ukyo said calmly.</p><p>"This isn't over Ukyo." Akane snapped, she grabbed the fallen dildo, stuffed it in the box and raced after Ranma. Ukyo watched them go from the door of the motel room.</p><p>"Yes it is Akane." Ukyo said to the night. "You just don't know it yet."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma closed the door to the cell with a sigh. "I know you're really angry at me right now." She said to the door. "You have a right to be."<p>"Come here Ranma." Akane said from the bed. Ranma could hear the suppressed anger in Akane's voice.</p><p>Ranma turned and walked to the bunk, head down. "Akane I." Ranma stopped when Akane slapped her. "Akane?"</p><p>"Shut up Ranma." Akane snapped. Akane pushed the redhead to her knees. "You want to be a girl?" She growled. "Then you can be a girl."</p><p style="text-align:center;">Lemon Section removed.</p><p>Ranma waited for Akane to fall asleep and then shakily extricated herself from Akane's arms and climbed back into her own bunk. Ranma was a long time crying herself to sleep.</p><p>End Chapter 7</p><p>Authors Notes part 2: A special shout out to Wharpt for prereading this chapter.
