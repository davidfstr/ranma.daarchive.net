</div><p>Chapter 10</p><p>'Undercover Rats'</p><p>Ukyo Kuonji was watching television in the living room of the Tendo home. She eased her sore shoulder and picked up her drink. Suddenly the movie she was watching was interrupted. "Special Bulletin, there has been a major prisoner breakout at the Tokyo Woman's Correction Facility. If you see any of the following people; please report their whereabouts to the police immediately." Grainy pictures of Ranko, Akane, Nabiki and Kimi were flashed on the screen. Ukyo sprayed the television with water.</p><p>"What?" Ukyo gasped in disbelief. "That's ridiculous."</p><p>"Not so ridiculous Uk-chan." Came a familiar voice from behind her. Ukyo spun around. "Ranma!" She cried. Standing next to a grinning Ranma, were Akane, Nabiki and Kimi. "What? How?" She pointed to the screen. "Oh never mind." She ran over and grabbed Ranma in a one armed hug.</p><p>"How ya feeling Uk-chan?" Ranma asked solicitously. "How's the shoulder?"</p><p>"Shoulder? What shoulder?" Ukyo replied in glee. She released Ranma and stood back. "Hey Akane."</p><p>"Ukyo." Akane smiled. "Making yourself right at home I see." She turned to Ranma. "I'm taking a bath." She turned back to Ukyo. "Come with me." She said.</p><p>"Go ahead Uk-chan." Ranma said. "You two need to talk anyway." Ranma squeezed Ukyo's arm. "It'll be alright."</p><p>Ukyo gave Ranma a puzzled look then followed Akane to the furo. Once there the two women stripped down and soaped themselves up. Ukyo shoulder, Akane noticed, only had an adhesive bandage over the bullet wound. Ukyo removed the bandage exposing the healing and sutured injury. "I see you're healing pretty fast." Akane said.</p><p>Ukyo shrugged. "Not as fast as I'd like." She replied. "Not everyone's Ranma you know."</p><p>"No. I guess not." Akane rinsed the soap off of her and eased into the furo. She looked at Ukyo. "Get in." She said.</p><p>Ukyo eyed Akane suspiciously but got into the furo. "Okay Akane." She said finally. "What's going on?"</p><p>"Which?' Akane replied. "Why the pretend escape or why are you here with me?"</p><p>"Start with this first." Ukyo replied impatiently. "Look Akane. I already told Ranma I'm not planning on coming between the two of you. So if this is some kind of,"</p><p>Akane held up a hand. "Let me talk okay?" She said. "Ranma already told me what you guys talked about." Akane blew out a breath. "Ranma also told you that he and I still have some things to work out." Ukyo nodded slowly. "Okay, I want to make a deal with you."</p><p>"Deal?" Ukyo asked. "What kind of deal?"</p><p>"Maybe deal is not the right word." Akane leaned against the side of the furo and closed her eyes. "I'm back to square one with Ranma." Akane said sadly. "Oh he's forgiven me but some of the trust is gone. Any claim I may have had on him is gone as well. Ranma is free to," Akane swallowed. "Choose again." Akane sighed. "Just don't rub it in my face, okay?"</p><p>Ukyo cupped some of the water of the furo between her hands and brought it to her face. "Okay." She said finally. "On one condition." Akane looked over. "Ranma is not a prize to be fought over."</p><p>"That's what got us into trouble in the first place." Akane muttered.</p><p>"Exactly." Ukyo replied. "No fighting over him. Give him the space he needs. No pressuring him to marry you and above all, treat him right.. You do that and I'll step aside when the time comes."</p><p>"I may be the one to step aside." Akane said sadly.</p><p>"I doubt it Akane." Ukyo smiled slightly. "Besides, what's the rush? We're only eighteen Akane, we have plenty of time."</p><p>There was a knock on the bathroom door. "Hey guys, you gonna be in there all night? I'd like to take a bath too." Came Ranma's female voice. "I'd like to change back while I have the chance."</p><p>"Come on in Ranma." Akane called.</p><p>The door opened and Ranma walked in. Her eyebrow rose. "You're still in the furo?" She said. "I can come back."</p><p>"Oh just get in here Ranma." Akane said crossly. "Ow." She said when Ukyo elbowed her. "I mean, it's okay. It's not like we both haven't all seen everything before." Ranma nodded and went over to the bathing area. She quickly soaped and rinsed herself then eased into the hot water of the furo. He immediately changed back to his male form.</p><p>"Ahh." Ranma said. "It's good to be me again." He looked over at Ukyo. "Lemme see your shoulder." He said firmly. His fingers gently probed at the healing wound. "Nice." He commented at last. "The doc does good work." Ranma looked at Akane. "You guys all settled?"</p><p>Akane nodded. "Yes Ranma." She looked down slightly. "Ukyo and I have made our peace."</p><p>Ranma grunted. "Good." He said. "Did you tell Ukyo about the parole?"</p><p>"Not yet Ranma." Akane replied. "Do you want to tell her or should I?"</p><p>"Go ahead." Ranma said. "You're gonna love this Uk-chan." He took her hand under the water.</p><p>Akane eyed the closeness between Ranma and Ukyo and sighed sadly. "It seems our good deeds of the past have come back to haunt us." Akane began.</p><p>"Hold on a second Akane." Ranma said. "Come over here." Akane moved through the water until she was next to Ranma. Ranma put his arm around her shoulder. "Okay now go on."</p><p>Akane snuggled a little closer. A contented smile came to her face. "Anyway. Remember the deal we had with Sargent Yasuhara?" She said to Ukyo in a brighter tone of voice.</p><p>Ukyo nodded. "I should." She said wryly. Her hand went to her shoulder. "Our plan was working too. A little too well."</p><p>Akane nodded. "Yeah, well we don't plan on making the same mistake."</p><p>"Yeah, Uk-chan." Ranma said. "This time you're gonna be where I can keep an eye on ya." He looked down at Akane. "Go on."</p><p>"Well anyway." Akane said. "The lieutenant, and the Tokyo Police Department, thinks we can be of better use out of prison then in it. He's offered us the opportunity to earn a full pardon if we assist him, and the Tokyo Police department, in breaking the entire drug operation."</p><p>"The lieutenant wants the remaining members of the NWC to go undercover." Added Ranma. "That includes you."</p><p>"Undercover?" Asked Ukyo. "Exactly what does that mean?</p><p>"We're not sure." Akane admitted. "But Ranma wants, no," Akane broke off. "We need you Ukyo." Akane looked at Ranma. "Ranma is right about that, we need you as part of the team."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"So this is your room." Kimi looked around. 'You can tell a lot about a person by their room.' Kimi thought. There was a computer on a desk in one corner. A stack of business and economics books stacked neatly to one side. By the number of book marks stuck in the books, it was obvious the books were well used and often referenced. A chart was stuck to a bulletin board. Kimi walked over and looked at it. The chart was a financial projection. "You didn't really expect to be worth that much in five years, did you?"<p>Nabiki looked sour. "Not at the moment. I can't work openly, at least for the time being. But if I hadn't been caught, yeah I did." Nabiki sat down at her desk in a swivel chair. She crossed her legs. "I had it all planned out. I already owned several businesses." Nabiki laughed suddenly. "I have to show you something." She reached into a desk drawer and pulled out a photo album. "Take a look."</p><p>Kimi opened the album. "Whoa." She said. "Who's the stud?"</p><p>"That, Kimi, is Ranma." Nabiki looked at the picture and sighed. "You don't know how difficult it was to live under the same roof as him." Nabiki jerked her chin. "Turn the page."</p><p>Kimi turned the page. "Oh lord." She looked at Nabiki in disgust. "You gave THAT up?" She asked. "What were you thinking girl? I've seen a lot of cocks in my life, but," Kimi whistled. Suddenly Kimi stopped as she suddenly realized who she was looking at. "Wait a minute, you're telling me this is Ranko?"</p><p>"That's Ranko." Nabiki said. "He'll probably be himself at dinner." She smiled at Kimi's expression. "It's real baby. Ranko and Ranma are the same person. Turn the page." She said. "That was one of my biggest selling pictures. Especially in Korea."</p><p>The picture was of the female Ranma, topless and her bottom covered in a nearly transparent green pair of panties. Kimi looked at the picture. "I can see why." She looked at Nabiki. "She looks like she's enjoying posing."</p><p>"She was." Nabiki agreed. "It was always amazing how much Ranma enjoyed posing like that." Nabiki shrugged. "I still haven't figured if it was the curse or something else." Nabiki said. "No I take that back. When Ranma first arrived he was, well a he. But somewhere along the line he changed."</p><p>"Not so surprising." Kimi said. "Hell girl, I know guys. The more macho they acted the more likely they had a gay streak. I bet you anything there's a guy that Ranko would do in a hot minute. "</p><p>"Probably Ryoga." Nabiki said with a laugh. "There was this time where Akane said she found Ryoga and the female Ranma in a tent together. Ranma said it was because of a magic fishing rod, but it was right after that, that Ranma started changing." She leaned over and turned several pages in the album. "That's Ryoga."</p><p>"Very cute." Kimi said appreciatively. "Got a better shot of him?" Kimi waggled her eyebrows.</p><p>"Turn the page." Nabiki said.</p><p>"Ooh, very nice." Kimi purred. "Two studs." Kimi turned the page of the album. "Now that's fine." Nabiki leaned over.</p><p>"Tatewaki Kuno." Nabiki said. An evil grin came to her face. "Handsome, rich and dumb as a brick."</p><p>"The perfect man." Kimi laughed. She raised an eyebrow. "Three major hotties and you didn't try any of them? I thought you were smart." She teased.</p><p>"I like my lovers to have some brains." Nabiki replied. She gave Kimi a significant look. "But to tell the truth all three of them were obsessed with Akane." She said. "I used to sell pictures of both Ranko and Akane to Tatewaki." Nabiki took the album from Kimi. "Made a fair amount of money off of him." She put the album back in the drawer. "Now I have to find a new way of making money at least until we get our pardon."</p><p>"Noriudo said we're going to get living expenses as part of the deal." Kimi reminded Nabiki.</p><p>"I think Noriudo's idea of living expenses and mine are not the same." Nabiki gave Kimi a apologetic shrug. "I like nice things."</p><p>Kimi nodded. "Me too." She tapped her lower lip. "You could always do what I did." She said hesitantly. "The massages, I mean."</p><p>Nabiki pursed her lips. "I know nothing about giving a massage." Nabiki said. "Especially not the kind of massages you're talking about. But I guess I could learn." She smiled at Kimi's expression. "Well you did say the money was good." Nabiki sat up. "We'll talk more about that later. I want to change into something nice." She stood. "Come on Kimi. I think I have a few things that will fit you." Nabiki opened the closet.</p><p>"Damn." Kimi said in awe. "You do like nice things." Her hands wandered through the racks of clothes. She stopped at a blouse. "Oh this is nice." She held it up to her chest. "Can I?"</p><p>Nabiki walked over to Kimi. "It'll look good on you girlfriend.." She said. "What's mine is yours."</p><p>Kimi smiled. "We going to share everything?" She asked teasingly.</p><p>"Of course." Nabiki replied. "Besides don't we have a date to keep?" Nabiki turned and looked in the closet. "We need to go shopping." She said. She reached into her bra and pulled out an envelope. "I got the rest of our stash before we left." She said.</p><p>Kimi reached into her bra. "You forgot this one." She said. Kimi pulled out another envelope.</p><p>"Did I ever tell you how much I like smart women?" Nabiki said.</p><p>"No." Kimi smiled. "How much?"</p><p>Nabiki leaned into Kimi. "This much." She whispered and kissed Kimi. "We won't be having dinner for a couple of hours." Nabiki said huskily.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi opened the door to the Tendo home. "Ukyo. " She called. "I'm home." She walked into the main room. "Hey Sis." Came a voice. Kasumi turned around slowly. Her eyes widened. "Akane!" She exclaimed in shock. Kasumi ran over an swept Akane up in a hug. "What are you doing here? Someone might see you." She demanded. "Never mind. You're here, that's what's important."<p>"You heard the broadcast huh?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Of course." Kasumi replied. "It was obviously a phony. You'd never do something so dishonorable." Kasumi released Akane. "Is everyone else here?"</p><p>Akane nodded. "Ranma is in the dojo. Ukyo is taking a nap. Nabiki and Kimi." Akane grinned. "They'll be down eventually."</p><p>Kasumi frowned slightly. "This Kimi." She began. "I don't know,"</p><p>"She makes Nabiki happy Sis." Akane said firmly. "Leave it at that, okay?"</p><p>Kasumi nodded. She looked at Akane. "And you and Ranma?" Kasumi asked. "I got the feeling something is wrong." She looked at Akane expectantly. "Ukyo seemed concerned."</p><p>Akane looked down. "We're working some things out." Akane said. "I don't want to talk about it right now." Akane shrugged. "Ranma is still talking to me, so that's something."</p><p>"Was that possible?" Kasumi asked worriedly. "Oh Akane, what did you do?"</p><p>"I lost my temper." Akane admitted. "Can we not talk about it right now?"</p><p>Dinner that night was a joyous affair. Nodoka, once she got over the shock of seeing her son, spent most of the evening pressing as much food as she could on him. Soun and Genma seemed to consider the whole idea as nothing out of the ordinary. "Why do you think Genma and I are not in jail ourselves?" Soun explained. "We went through something similar. Didn't we Saotome?"</p><p>"Indeed Tendo." Genma grinned. "Before you were born boy. Remind me to tell you about it someday."</p><p>"What I don't understand." Ukyo said during dinner. "Is why you're here. You could be seen."</p><p>"That's what I said." Kasumi agreed.</p><p>"Well the lieutenant wasn't happy about it but we convinced him." Nabiki replied. "Besides there was no way we were going to do this and let you think we really broke jail." Nabiki frowned slightly. "But this may be the last time you see us for some time."</p><p>"Well we're gonna be here for awhile no matter what." Ranma said. "Ukyo still needs to finish healing and we ain't doin nothing without her." Ranma stretched. "Well I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm kinda tired." He stood. "Is the futon still in the guest room?"</p><p>Kasumi nodded. "Everything is the way you left it Ranma." She said. "I didn't have the heart to put anything away."</p><p>Kimi watched Ranma walk away. She leaned over to Nabiki. "You let that get away?" She whispered.</p><p>"You saw what Akane did in the weight room, right?" Nabiki whispered back. "Would you get between her and him?"</p><p>"Good point." Kimi replied. "On the other hand, if you had gotten him you wouldn't have given me the time of day."</p><p>Nabiki smiled. "Ranma's right, it's been a long day." She stood up. "Coming Kimi?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma was just about to get into bed when there was a knock on the guest room door. "Come on in." He called. The door slid open. Akane was standing there in her favorite yellow pajamas. "Hey Tomboy. What's up?"<p>Akane looked down. "Can I sleep here tonight?" She asked in a near whisper. "Please."</p><p>Ranma looked at Akane for a long moment. "Didn't you get enough of me when we were in prison?" Ranma asked. He was not smiling when he said it.</p><p>"Never Ranma." Akane replied in the same quiet voice. "I just, I want. Please Ranma. We don't have to do anything or, or we can do anything you want. Whatever you want."</p><p>Ranma got into the futon. He patted the mattress. "Come to bed Akane." Akane almost ran to the futon. She got in a rolled over so she was next to Ranma. "You tell Uk-chan you were coming here?" He asked.</p><p>Akane nodded. "Actually I asked her if it would be alright." She admitted in a quiet voice. "She said yes."</p><p>"Good." Ranma gathered Akane in his arms. "I really want the two of you to be friends."</p><p>Akane nodded against Ranma's chest. "I told you Ranma, whatever you want." She said. "I, I like Ukyo. I really do." Akane's finger made a random design on Ranma's chest. "If I tell you something, will you promise not to laugh."</p><p>"Depends on what it is." Ranma replied. "Best I can do Tomboy."</p><p>"Fair enough." Akane looked up at Ranma. "Except for a couple things that happened, I think my time with you in prison was among the best times in my life." Except for a slight quirk of his lips Ranma said nothing. "For a short time I really felt like I was your partner. I want that Ranma. I really want that."</p><p>"So do I Tomboy." Ranma replied. "I need to be able to trust you."</p><p>"I know Ranma." Akane replied. "I know I have to earn your trust again. But I will Ranma. I will. All I want is the chance." Akane swallowed. "Please Ranma."</p><p>Ranma placed a finger over Akane's lips. "I'm giving you the chance Tomboy." He said gently.</p><p>Akane smiled slightly. "Are you really tired?" She asked. "Or do you want to fool around?"</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "Boy or girl?" He asked.</p><p>"Whatever you want Ranma." Akane replied. "Whatever you want."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Lt. Noriudo did not show up until the following afternoon. He looked around at the assembled group of people in the living room. "I hope you all understand that everything I say must be kept in the strictest confidence."<p>"Of course Lieutenant." Nodoka said impatiently. "Our children's lives are at stake." Nodoka looked around the room, she gave Ukyo and then Kimi a nod. "All are children's lives."</p><p>"Did your Aunt just include me?" Kimi asked Nabiki. She and Nabiki were sitting on the couch close together.</p><p>"Yeah. She's something isn't she?" Nabiki replied. "Now pay attention."</p><p>"Good." The Lieutenant continued. "Dr. Tofu." The lieutenant turned to the doctor. "When will Ukyo be well enough to go into the field?"</p><p>Dr. Tofu grimaced. "If I had my way, she'd be spending the better part of a month recuperating." He said. "Ukyo may heal fast but not that fast."</p><p>"A month is fine." The lieutenant replied. "It's going to take at least that long to complete their training." He fixed the active members of the NWC with a stern look. "You are all going underground. You will be given new names. New identities. Plus some of you will get special training so you can blend in to your new environment."</p><p>"What kind of training?" Ukyo asked. She, Ranma and Akane were sitting on the floor next to each other. The lieutenant noticed that while Ranma kept his arm around Akane's shoulders, he was also holding Ukyo's hand.</p><p>"You are going to be split into two teams." The lieutenant replied. "Nabiki Tendo and Kimi Ota will be one team. The three of you the other." He looked at Nabiki. "Ms. Tendo you and Ms. Ota will be working directly with my department. The two of you will work semi-autonomously. Find out what you can, any way you can."</p><p>Nabiki and Kimi looked at each other and grinned. Nabiki looked at the lieutenant. "Do I have a budget?"</p><p>The lieutenant pulled an envelope out of his pocket and tossed it to Nabiki. "Try not to spend it all in one place." He said.</p><p>Nabiki opened the envelope. She smiled in satisfaction. "Oh this will be fine. Where do you want me to deposit the profits?"</p><p>"Any profits you make are yours." The lieutenant replied. "Normally we wouldn't do anything like this, but your reputation convinced my superiors it was an acceptable risk. Only I and my direct superior will know where you are and under what identities."</p><p>"And us?" Ranma asked. "You mentioned training."</p><p>Lt. Noriudo spread his hands slightly apart in indecision. "We have a couple idea. We're going to run some aptitude tests on the three of you to determine what would be best. Then we can decide."</p><p>End Chapter 10</p><p>Author's Notes: I love the new stats report that fanfiction now provides. It gives me a glimpse into who's reading this story. I used to rely on the reviews to see which chapter was the most popular.</p><p>I hope everyone is enjoying the ride so far. Any guesses, except from Wharpt, where the story is going to go now? Lot's of things to do; get the bad guys for one. Now if you were Nabiki and Kimi how would you go about it?</p>
