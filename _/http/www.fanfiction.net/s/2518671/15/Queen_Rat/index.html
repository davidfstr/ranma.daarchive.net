</div><p>Chapter 16</p><p>'Retribution'</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo woke just before dawn. "What time are they leaving?" Ranma asked Akane.</p><p>"Nabs said around two." Akane replied. She looked out of the window and at the grounds below. Akane shivered as her imagination gave her a vivid image of what her sister had been doing and probably would do again before she left.</p><p>"We'll stay until just after they leave." Ranma decided. "We can hang out here."</p><p>Ukyo walked over to Akane. "It's almost over." She said quietly. Akane nodded but continued looking out the window.</p><p>Kimi and Nabiki climbed into the back of the limo. Both Kenichi and the senior Satoh came to see them off. "Bye cutie." Kimi called. She tapped the necklace around her neck. "Thank you so much for the little gift. It was so thoughtful." The old man grinned happily.</p><p>"And thank you Kenichi." Nabiki purred. "You were very thoughtful as well." She patted her purse. "Feel free to call any time." Nabiki smiled. The smile lasted until the door closed and they began to drive off. Her smile changed to an expression of disgust. Nabiki felt Kimi wrap her arms around her. Nabiki leaned against Kimi. "Thanks." She said quietly.</p><p>Kimi kissed Nabiki on the top of the head. "Anytime." Kimi replied in the same quiet tones. "We'll talk when we get home."</p><p>Nabiki and Kimi entered their apartment. Nabiki kicked off her shoes. "I'm taking a shower." She said. She pulled off her blond wig and started removing clothing as she walked. "Keep the guys occupied until I get back." She said over her shoulder.</p><p>"Guys?" Asked Kimi. "What guys?"</p><p>"Us." Came a voice. Kimi turned to see the grinning faces of Ranma, Akane and Ukyo. Akane's grin quickly faded and she looked off toward the bathroom.</p><p>"She'll be fine Akane." Kimi assured her. "And if she's not, I'll be here."</p><p>Akane gave Kimi a searching look. Then she nodded. "How are you holding up?" She asked Kimi.</p><p>"I'm fine." Kimi replied easily. "Though I'll feel even better if you tell me you found something." She nodded her head toward the bathroom. "Make Nabs feel better too."</p><p>Ranma smiled and pulled out the pad he had written the names and numbers on. "Got this off a book in a private office. I think I recognized a couple names."</p><p>Kimi took the pad and started reading off the names. Her finger stopped at one number. "I recognize the exchange; this is in the warehouse district down by the docks." Kimi walked over to her computer and tapped in the number into a search program. "Let's see if this was one of our 'possibles'." She said. "Bingo." She said a few minutes later.</p><p>"Good news?" Nabiki's voice came from behind. She had come out of the bathroom covered in a fluffy robe and a towel was wrapped around her head. "Hey Akane."</p><p>Akane walked over to Nabiki and pulled her into a tight hug. "I just want you to know, you're the bravest person I know." Akane said feelingly. "I'm proud to be your sister."</p><p>"I'm not so brave sis." Nabiki began only to be interrupted by Akane.</p><p>"Yes you are." She said firmly. "I know I couldn't do what you did."</p><p>"We fight with the weapons we have Sis." Nabiki replied. "But thanks anyway." Nabiki blinked a tear away. "What have we got?" She asked Kimi gruffly.</p><p>Kimi smiled triumphantly. "A warehouse down at the docks." She replied. "And get this; the owner is one Saburo Watanabe."</p><p>"Watanabe." Breathed Nabiki. "From the prison board."</p><p>"One and the same, Nabs. And guess what? He was there last night." Kimi nodded decisively. "Connection two and three." She looked at Nabiki. "It was worth it girlfriend."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. She turned to Ranma. "Shut it down." She ordered. "I'll call Noriudo and let him know."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"A massive explosion of unknown origin damaged a warehouse down at the dockyards last night." The reporter said. The image cut away to show a warehouse with one side smashed open. "When the police and fire department arrived a large cache of drugs was discovered among the wreckage." The screen flashed back to a reporter holding a finger to his ear. "This just in." The man said excitedly into the microphone. "Police have detained the owner of the warehouse, Saburo Watanabe, for questioning."<p>Kenichi Satoh flicked the television off angrily. "Ruined." he growled. "Months of planning; ruined."</p><p>"I told you not to use Watanabe." The old woman in the room said waspishly. She pointed a finger at the screen. "That was no accident. Someone knew."</p><p>Kenichi opened his mouth to protest then closed it abruptly. He nodded. "You're right." He said grudgingly. "You're right." He said again. "I should have seen it. Thank you Auntie." Kenichi began to pace. "They must have made the connection at the prison." He looked at the old woman. "Kigomi?"</p><p>"My grand-daughter would not be so stupid." The old woman replied. "No the leak is not from her but I think I know who." She picked up the remote and pressed a few buttons. The television came on and showed a recording of the dinner party. The old woman pressed another button and the picture zoomed in on one woman. "Her."</p><p>"Mari?" Kenichi said in disbelief. "Ridiculous." He snorted.</p><p>"Not ridiculous." The old woman replied sharply. "That woman is involved. I know it." She gave her nephew a glare. "Don't look at me like that. Your Father knew enough to listen to me."</p><p>Kenichi shrugged and strode over to a small table that held a telephone. He picked it up and pressed a button. "Genjiru, I have a little job for you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Not that I'm not enjoying your company Sis." Nabiki said in mild complaint. "But when are the three of you planning on going home?"<p>"We've only been here a couple days." Akane protested. "Come on Nabs, I haven't seen you in months."</p><p>"Just teasing Akane." Nabiki said with a grin. "What say we go out dancing tonight?" She turned. "What do you think Kimi?"</p><p>"Dancing sounds good." Kimi agreed. "I think we earned a little reward." She turned to look at Ranma and Ukyo sitting on the sofa. "Which one of you is going to be the boy tonight?" She asked with a grin.</p><p>"Both." Akane said immediately. She looked at Ranma and Ukyo. "Please?" She begged in her Aoi voice.</p><p>Ukyo snorted. "I wondered why you packed my Big Daddy suit." She shook her head. "Sure why not?" She turned her head. "Wipe that drool off your face Ran-chan."</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. 'He really was almost drooling.' She realized. She snorted to herself. 'Whatever. As long as they're happy.'</p><p>"What are you wearing Ranma?" Kimi asked. Ranma grinned.</p><p>The doorman at The Spot, Tokyo's most exclusive night club, scanned the crowd of people wanting to get in. Most were going to be disappointed. 'Only the beautiful, the rich and the famous' was the motto of The Spot. He spotted five people getting out of a cab. 'One out of three.' He thought to himself. Three extremely attractive women, though the one with blue hair was a little too muscular for his taste, and two extremely handsome men approached. The women were dressed in mini-skirts that showed off a lot of leg and midriff baring tops. The two men walked over, one was dressed all in a white suit and carried a cane. His long hair hung loose across his shoulders. 'Pimp' was the doorman's instant assessment. The other man was wearing tight fitting leather pants and a mesh shirt that showed off his muscular physique. His hair was tied in a loose ponytail. 'Pimp's boyfriend.' He thought in amusement. The doorman waved the five forward. "Do you have a reservation?" The doorman asked. He held out his hand suggestively.</p><p>The pimp nodded and extended his hand. "The name is Ono." The pimp said with a grin. The doorman and the man in white exchanged a handshake. The doorman looked quickly at the bill in his hand. 'Two out of three.' He smiled broadly. "Ah, yes Ono, party of five." He unhooked the velvet rope. "Go right in."</p><p>"Thank you." The man in white said. And five more beautiful people entered The Spot.</p><p>Akane hooked an arm each through Ranma and Ukyo's arms as they searched for a table. They found one, eventually, tucked into the back corner of the bar against the balcony overlooking the dance floor. Nabiki flagged a waiter. "Chenin Blanc if you have it." She ordered. She raised an eyebrow to the people at the table. "For all of us." The waiter nodded and walked away.</p><p>"I wanna dance." Ranma said and stood. He took Akane's hand. "Coming Big Daddy?"</p><p>"Not yet." Kimi whispered to Nabiki.</p><p>Nabiki grinned as Ranma, Akane and Ukyo walked away. "You noticed huh?" She said to Kimi. "I'm a little surprised but not as much as I would have been a year ago."</p><p>"Takes all kinds girlfriend." Kimi replied. She looked down at the dance floor. The waiter approached with their drinks. Kimi paid. She sipped her wine as she watched the dancers gyrate on the floor below. She made out Ranma, Akane and Ukyo as they made their way on to the dance floor. Her eyes widened. "You know I don't think they know how hot they are together." She whispered as the three began to dance.</p><p>"They know girlfriend." Nabiki replied. "They know." She pointed with her chin. "Incorrigible exhibitionists all three of them." Nabiki grinned.</p><p>Akane smiled widely as Ranma and Ukyo sandwiched her between them. Ukyo in front and Ranma behind. Ranma had one arm around Akane's waist. The other arm on Ukyo's shoulder. Ukyo mirrored Ranma's pose. 'And I called Ranma shameless.' Akane thought cheerfully. Suddenly the music changed to a slower but sexually charged beat. "Hey Usagi." Akane shouted over the music. "They're playing your song."</p><p>Ranma grinned and spun away. One hand went behind his head while the other wrapped around his stomach. Ranma seemed to ooze to the floor landing on his knees. Ranma arched his head to the floor and then rolled over into a split all in time to the hard driving beat.</p><p>"Looks different when he does it as a boy." Akane shouted to Ukyo over the music. "Doesn't it?"</p><p>"Yeah," Agreed Ukyo. "Hotter."</p><p>A circle formed around Ranma as he gyrated to the rhythm. Screams of approval came from the women and many of the men in the crowd. Ranma spun like a top one second and then would ooze boneless to the ground another. His hips at times seemed to have a life of their own as they moved seemingly as a separate entity and Ranma's legs and torso were merely passengers.</p><p>"Go Ran-chan. Go Ran-chan, Go Ran-chan. Go Ran-chan." Akane and Ukyo chorused.</p><p>Nabiki and Kimi watched in fascinated appreciation from the balcony. Suddenly a movement out of the corner of her eye caught Nabiki's attention. She turned her head slightly and her eyes widened. Nabiki slowly reached into her purse and pulled out her compact. She opened the compact and tilted the mirror until she was able to get a light to shine in Ranma's eyes. He looked up and continued dancing. Nabiki jerked her head to the side. Ranma looked. He turned back to Nabiki and nodded.</p><p>Ranma danced over to Akane and Ukyo "Heads up guys." He pointed with his chin. Two heavily muscled men in suits were making their way toward Nabiki and Kimi. Nabiki whispered something to Kimi and the taller blond eased slowly to her feet. Ranma recognized the stance that Kimi moved slowly into. 'Good thinking Nabs.' He thought as he realized that Nabiki had given Kimi some training. "Now." He shouted. There were shrieks from the crowd as Ranma jumped to the balcony. Ukyo and Akane a beat behind. They all landed on the railing. There was a burst of applause from the crowd.</p><p>The two men reared back in surprise as three people suddenly appeared on the railing right next to them. They instinctively reached into their pockets. A tall man in leather pants jumped toward them and then was standing right in front of them. He was shaking his finger scoldingly.</p><p>"Now gentlemen." Ranma said in a menacing tone as he approached. "If I see even a glint of metal, I'll make you eat it." The men stopped in stunned disbelief then made a move. Ranma's hands flew out from his body and struck the two men. They fell to a heap on the ground.</p><p>"They're no fun." Ukyo complained. "They fell right over."</p><p>Akane nodded in agreement. Akane bent down and lifted the two men up and pushed them into a couple spare chairs. Akane sat on one man's lap while she started going through his pockets. She looked up to see Nabiki shaking her head. Akane grinned. "I picked up some bad habits, I guess." She returned to searching the man. "Knife." She tossed the item on the table. "Wallet." She opened it. She took out a wad of yen and placed it in her bra. "No money." She said. "Drivers license. Credit cards. Not bad Kuro." She turned to Ranma. "Kuro Masuyo." She said. "Says here he works for Osamu Industries."</p><p>"Another connection." Kimi said happily. "Osamu Industries owns a shipping firm." She looked at the other unconscious man. "How about him?"</p><p>"Juro Hotaka." Ukyo replied. "Also employed at Osamu Industries." She looked at Kimi. "You realize this means your cover is blown."</p><p>" Maybe." Nabiki sat down and crossed her arms and legs. Her head bent down in thought. "Probably." She said a minute later. "I think Kenichi sent them." She stood up. "We'll know when we get back to the apartment."</p><p>"What should we do with the wonder twins?" Asked Kimi.</p><p>Ranma grinned. "What we always do." Ranma turned to Akane. "You take Juro. I'll get Kuro." He grinned wider. "Hey that rhymes." Ranma and Akane hurriedly carried the two unconscious men out of the night club. Ukyo, Nabiki and Kimi followed them out. "Get a cab Nabs." Ranma called as he and Akane ran off carrying the two men.</p><p>Nabiki turned to see the doorman staring at her. "They had a little too much to drink." She said in explanation. Nabiki pulled out her cell phone and dialed a number. She spoke quickly and then hung up. "I called a cab. They'll be here in twenty minutes or so."</p><p>"Plenty of time." Ukyo said with a satisfied look on her face. "Not a bad evening, huh Nabs?"</p><p>"Just like old times Ukyo." Nabiki replied. She rolled her eyes. "How are you holding up Kimi?"</p><p>Kimi was looking toward where Ranma and Akane had run off. She turned to Ukyo. "They looked like they were having the time of their lives." She said. "You too." She looked at Nabiki. "Old times huh?"</p><p>Nabiki spread her hands helplessly. "What can I say?" Nabiki replied. "This kind of stuff used to happen a lot." Nabiki nodded toward where Ranma and Akane had run off to. "Ukyo and those two were usually in the middle of it."</p><p>"You too Nabs." Ukyo replied. "If I remember correctly." Ukyo turned to Kimi. "Sure you want to throw in your lot with the likes of us?" She asked Kimi. "We're a lot more trouble then we're worth."</p><p>Kimi laughed and walked over to Nabiki. She wrapped a companionable arm around Nabiki's shoulders. "I think I'll stick around for awhile." She said to Nabiki.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The cab pulled up in front of Nabiki's apartment. Five people got out of the cab. Nabiki leaned in the window and paid the driver. She started walking toward the apartment building.<p>"Better let me take point." Ranma said. He walked quickly away.</p><p>Kimi's mouth dropped open as Ranma seemed to vanish into the shadows. "Umisenken." Akane said quietly. "Tell you later." She waved Ukyo on and she and Ukyo ran ahead. Nabiki took Kimi's arm and they walked slowly toward the apartment.</p><p>"I thought you were joking." Kimi said in awe as they walked into the building. Since their apartment was on the second floor they walked up the stairs. Kimi stopped in shock as they came across an unconscious man on the landing of their floor.</p><p>"Ranma was here." Nabiki said calmly. "It should be safe to go to our apartment." Nabiki and Kimi exited from the stairwell and into their floor. They walked into their apartment to find another unconscious man being searched by Akane.</p><p>"One more in the bedroom." Akane said without looking up. "We'll get rid of them so you guys can get some sleep." Akane stood. "Hey Ranma you about finished?"</p><p>Ranma came out of the bedroom holding another unconscious man. "Yeah." He said. "Hi guys." He said cheerfully. "Just taking out the trash." He started out of the apartment. "Come on Tomboy, I think I saw a water tower a couple blocks from here."</p><p>"I'll stay here and watch for any stragglers." Ukyo said. "Hurry back, okay?" Ranma nodded and he and Akane ran out of the apartment each carrying an unconscious thug. Ukyo walked around the apartment and started straightening up. Surprisingly, for the NWC, there was little damage.</p><p>"I better call Noriudo and tell him the news." Nabiki said regretfully. "Well we had a good run and pretty much did what we were supposed to." She pulled her cell phone out of her purse. "Should I call for a pizza?" She asked. "After I call Noriudo, that is."</p><p>"Better get three." Ukyo replied with a grin. "Two for us." Ukyo's grin got wider. "Two and a half."</p><p>Nabiki grinned and lifted the cell phone to her ear. She froze. "H-hikaru." She stammered. Hikaru Nakamura was standing at the door.</p><p>Ukyo spun around. 'Shit! How did he get in without us noticing?' Ukyo eased into a ready stance. Ukyo thought back on what Nabiki had reported. 'Fight to delay.' She decided. "Mind introducing me to your friend, Mari." She said calmly.</p><p>"Who are you punk?" Hikaru snarled. He advanced toward Nabiki. "Don't even think it punk." Hikaru snarled. "You don't know who you're messing with."</p><p>"Neither do you." Ukyo replied coolly. She advanced to intercept Hikaru.</p><p>Nabiki walked quickly over to Kimi while Hikaru was distracted. "Kimi get ready to run out of here." She whispered. "Wait for the fight to start."</p><p>Kimi looked at Nabiki in disbelief. "Run?" She hissed back. "And leave Ukyo?"</p><p>"Listen to me." Nabiki said in an urgent whisper. "Ukyo can hold him off, at least for a short time. You run out and start screaming for Ranma. Got it?" Kimi swallowed and nodded. "Good." Nabiki turned. "Now lover don't be jealous." She said soothingly. "This is just a friend. Just like you."</p><p>"Save it Mari, or whatever your real name is, you and Su are coming with me." He strode over towards Nabiki. Hikaru found his path blocked by Ukyo's cane. "You're starting to bother me punk." He growled angrily.</p><p>"Good." Ukyo said. She gave Hikaru a feral smile. "My friends are going nowhere they don't want to go." She tapped Hikaru's chest a few times with the head of the cane. "Back up."</p><p>Hikaru snarled. His arm came at blinding speed and trapped the cane . His other hand came up and struck the cane with his palm. The cane snapped in half. With the same blinding speed his arm shot out toward Ukyo. His eyes widened when Ukyo was able to quickly fade away from the strike.</p><p>Ukyo narrowed her eyes and focused on Hikaru. "I liked that cane." She said in annoyance. She raised her hands into position. "Not bad speed." She said in a clinical tone. She stepped forward and threw a fast set of strikes with her hands. Hikaru was easily able to block them but Ukyo could tell that she had surprised him. "Good defense." She smiled. "I've seen better."</p><p>Nabiki pulled Kimi toward the door. She waited until Hikaru made his move before pushing Kimi out through the door. "Get Ranma." She hissed. Nabiki took a breath and turned to watch the fight.</p><p>Hikaru charged. His assault got Ukyo backing up. His snarl became deeper as Ukyo continued to evade his punches and kicks. Hikaru barely evaded a spinning back kick to his head and jumped backwards. He eyed Ukyo angrily. "I don't have time for this." He raised his arms.</p><p>Ukyo narrowed her eyes again. She too raised her arms. "Take your best shot." She said. The air seemed to boil around both Ukyo and Hikaru. Ukyo and Hikaru threw their arms toward each other at the same time. There was a soundless 'whump' throughout the room. Hikaru staggered slightly but Ukyo was tossed across the room. Ukyo landed in a dazed heap against the far wall. Hikaru breathed deeply through his nose and straightened. He spat at Ukyo. "Punk." Hikaru wiped a hand through his hair to straighten it. He turned. Nabiki was still in the room he observed. She had her hands raised defensively. "Don't make me laugh." He sneered derisively. "You saw what I did to your friend." He said coldly.</p><p>"I didn't." Said an angry voice. Hikaru turned. He rolled his eyes at the man in the leather pants and mesh shirt. He turned his back contemptuously and reached for Nabiki. "Let's go." His hand was intercepted.</p><p>"I think not." Ranma said. He smiled coldly at Hikaru. "I want you to show me what you did to my," Ranma thumbed his chest. "Friend." He looked past Hikaru. "How's Uk-chan?"</p><p>"She's just dazed Ranma." Akane said.</p><p>Hikaru's eyes widened. "What the..?" He pulled his hand out of Ranma's grasp and jumped backwards. He spared a quick glance toward the far wall. There was a muscular looking girl kneeling next to the pimp.</p><p>"Good." Ranma replied to Akane. He looked at Hikaru. "I'm going to give you the opportunity of a lifetime." He told Hikaru. "I'm gonna let you fight me." Ranma pointed upwards. "The roof is flat and pretty wide." Ranma smiled invitingly. "Show me what you did to Uk-chan." He almost purred. "In fact I want you to show me what you did to all my friends."</p><p>Hikaru snorted in amusement. "Faggot thinks he can fight huh?" He said. "Okay faggot you got a deal. You wanna get fucked? You're gonna get fucked."</p><p>"Ooh." Ranma laughed. "Nabs said you were good." There were a couple snorts of amusement from the watchers. Ranma waved toward the open door. "Shall we?" Ranma backed up toward the door. "I'll be waiting." He sang and ran out of the apartment. Hikaru raced after him.</p><p>"Help me up Akane." Ukyo gasped. "I have got to see this." Akane reached down and pulled Ukyo to her feet. She wrapped an arm around Ukyo's waist. "Let's go." Ukyo said in excitement. Almost carrying Ukyo, Akane raced after Ranma and Hikaru.</p><p>Nabiki ran out of the apartment building. "Kimi?" She called loudly. "Where are you?"</p><p>Kimi ran out from the shadows surrounding the building. "Nabs!" She cried in relief. She ran up to Nabiki and grabbed her wrist. "Come on, let's get out of here." She stopped in shock as Nabiki refused to budge.</p><p>"Uh Uh Kimi." Nabiki reversed the grip and took Kimi's wrist. "Ranma is going to fight." She said excitedly. "You can't miss this."</p><p>"But. But what if Hikaru wins?" Kimi said nervously as Nabiki pulled her along.</p><p>"Girlfriend." Nabiki replied as she started running back toward the apartment. "If Hikaru wins there isn't anywhere we could hide and be safe."</p><p>Hikaru reached the roof of the apartment building. He found Ranma leaning against a chimney less than twenty feet away. Hikaru removed his jacket and tossed it aside. "Come on faggot."</p><p>Ranma laughed. "What's your hurry stud?" Ranma said. "Don't you want to wait for the audience?" Ranma pointed to the stairs to the roof. "Ah here they come now." Akane and Ukyo came up the stairs and on to the roof. Akane half led half carried Ukyo over to the side. She helped Ukyo get seated then sat down next to her. "Let's wait for the rest." Ranma said.</p><p>"The rest?" Hikaru asked skeptically. "If Mari and Su are half as smart as I think they are, they're on their way to China right now."</p><p>"Not so lover." Nabiki said from the stairs. "You know we love to see you fight." She pulled a reluctant Kimi on to the roof. "The last one was so short. Right Kimi?"</p><p>"R-right Nabs." Kimi replied. She eyed Hikaru nervously.</p><p>"Sit next to me Kimi." Akane called. "Plenty of room." Nabiki pulled Kimi over to Akane. The two girls sat. "What are the odds, sis?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Five to two Hikaru lasts ten minutes." Nabiki replied. "And only cause you're my sister."</p><p>"That's a sucker bet sis." Akane replied with a grin. "Five minutes. Tops." She reached into her purse. "One thousand yen."</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "You're on." Nabiki looked over to the fighters. "You can fight Hikaru now Ranma."</p><p>"Ranma?" Hikaru narrowed his eyes as the name finally registered. "Ranma Saotome?"</p><p>"I see ya heard of me." Ranma curtsied. "The one and the same." Ranma wiped at his nose with his thumb. "Show me what ya got."</p><p>Hikaru leaped into the air toward Ranma. Ranma jumped up to meet him. The two fighters exchanged a rapid series of kicks in mid air then both landed lightly on the ground. Hikaru spun around and launched himself into the air once again. His eyes widened as Ranma came back to meet him. Another flurry of kicks ensued and again the two men landed lightly on the ground. Hikaru spun around and got into a defensive stance. Ranma was also in a defensive stance. Hikaru charged.</p><p>Ranma backed up and evaded Hikaru's charge. Backed up and evaded. Suddenly Hikaru stopped. "A spiral." He said suspiciously. "You're leading me into a spiral." He eyed Ranma again. "I don't know why, but it can't be good." he backed up.</p><p>Ranma's eyebrows rose. "Interesting." He murmured. He advanced toward Hikaru. "You may lose that bet Tomboy." He called over his shoulder. "Nabs says you're fast." Ranma said. "How fast?" He started throwing punches at Hikaru. Hikaru blocked. Ranma increased his speed forcing Hikaru to block more and more rapidly. Soon their hands and arms were just blurs. Finally a punch got though Hikaru's defenses and sent him skidding across the apartment roof.</p><p>"Fuck this." Hikaru snarled. He raised his hands in front of him toward the advancing Ranma. Hikaru gathered his chi, letting it build, letting if fill his entire body. Hikaru seemed to expand in size.</p><p>Ranma gathered his chi as he advanced. His body seemed to grow to match Hikaru's. To Akane and the others it seemed as two titans had come to earth to fight. The two giants threw their punches simultaneously. There was a bright flash of actinic light. The observers threw their arms up to cover their eyes. When they lowered their arms, one normal sized figure remained standing.</p><p>"Time." Called Ranma.</p><p>Nabiki clicked the stop watch she held in her hand. "Five minutes, seven seconds." She said. "Pay up Akane."</p><p>"Let me see that." Demanded Akane. She reached for the stop watch. "Damn."</p><p>"Nabs." Kimi whispered to Nabiki in a hushed voice.</p><p>"Yeah Kimi."</p><p>"I think I came." Kimi swallowed heavily. "Oh man."</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "Yeah Ranma has that effect on people." Nabiki took her cell phone out of her pocket. She dialed a number. "Dominos?" She said. "Yeah, four large octopus pizzas." Nabiki gave her address and closed the phone.</p><p>"Aren't you going to call Noriudo?" Kimi asked.</p><p>"Later." Nabiki replied. "How long is he going to be out?" She called to Ranma. Ranma knelt down. "Ten minutes at the most." He replied. Nabiki nodded. "There's a rope in our bedroom." Nabiki said.</p><p>"I'll get it." Said Kimi. She stood and ran for the stairs.</p><p>"I know I'm going to regret asking this." Ukyo said. "But why is there a rope in your bedroom?" She shook her head. "Never mind I can guess." She blew out a breath. "I want to know who taught Hikaru that." Kimi came running up the stairs with a rope. Ukyo watched as Ranma carefully tied the man up. "You were right he had Joketsuzoku training."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "He knows some techniques but he doesn't have'em all under control." Ranma smiled smugly. "I'm still the best." Ranma hoisted Hikaru on his shoulder and carried him down the stairs. The rest of the group followed. They entered the apartment. Ranma placed Hikaru against a wall. "Call the Lieutenant." He told Nabiki. "The sooner he's safely locked up the better."</p><p>"I don't like this." Ukyo started pacing. "Who would be training him and why?"</p><p>"My vote is the old ghoul." Said Nabiki. "I always felt they left too easily." She nodded toward the bound Hikaru. "Look at him." She said. "He's almost Ranma."</p><p>"Hey." Protested Ranma. Ranma looked down at the bound man. "But I know what you mean." He knelt down to look at Hikaru. "Except I don't think he traveled the same road I did." Ranma stood. "His Joketsuzoku training is pretty recent. Probably less than a year." He said. "It could be the old ghoul." Ranma suddenly looked at the door. "And if it is," He got into a defensive stance. Ukyo and Akane looked startled but did the same just as the door exploded inwards.</p><p>"Airen!"</p><p>"Shampoo." Chorused everyone in the room except Kimi.</p><p>Shampoo looked around and saw Hikaru tied up. "Airen." She shrieked. "What you do to Airen?"</p><p>"Airen?" Ranma gasped. "Hikaru?" He looked at Shampoo. "Hey wait a minute." He said. "If he's your Airen then why are you still calling me Airen?"</p><p>Shampoo scuffed the ground with her toe. "Well that great grandmother idea." Shampoo looked up with a big smile. "Shampoo like idea."</p><p>Ranma scanned the room quickly. "Come out old ghoul." He called. "I know you're there." Ranma focused on a spot near the door. "In fact." He raised a hand and aimed a palm toward the spot. A grinning Cologne appeared near the door.</p><p>"That's my son-in-law." Cologne said in approval. She tilted her head. "You seem different. Are you wearing makeup?" She shook her ancient head. "Oh never mind. We'll just take Hikaru and be on our way." She rolled her eyes when Akane and Ukyo went and stood in front of Hikaru. "Oh please children, haven't you learned?" She looked at Shampoo. "Shampoo get Hikaru."</p><p>Shampoo sped toward Hikaru only to find her ankle seized. Shampoo squeaked in surprise when Akane tossed her to the ground. Shampoo looked up to see Ukyo's spatula hovering over her head. "Great grandmother?" Shampoo said. "This not work." She spun suddenly and rolled away. Shampoo narrowed her eyes at Akane and Ukyo. "You work together now?" She asked. "No matter. Keep Airen for now. We get later."</p><p>"Just go." Growled Ranma. There was the sound of a police siren. Ranma turned his head and then quickly turned back. Shampoo and Cologne were gone. "Damn."</p><p>"That should be Noriudo." Nabiki said. "I called him while you were talking." She walked over to the door and shook her head. "This is coming out of my cleaning deposit." She said in disgust.</p><p>Lt. Noriudo came running toward them. "What happened?" He demanded.</p><p>"Come on in Lieutenant." Nabiki said. "I have something to tell you."</p><p>Lt. Noriudo walked into the apartment. He noticed the bound Hikaru. "That Hikaru?" He asked. He smiled nastily. "From the looks of him he tried to take on Ranma." He turned around. "Never a good idea. Right Ranma?" Lt. Noriudo's head snapped back. "Where'd they go?"</p><p>Nabiki leaned against the wall. "I don't know but I can guess." Nabiki smiled grimly.</p><p>"They're going after Satoh." Noriudo exclaimed in sudden understanding. "I have to stop them." He said. "If they kill him," Noriudo was interrupted by Nabiki.</p><p>"They won't." Nabiki said. "But I wouldn't care if they did." Nabiki's smile got very cold. "In fact, I wish I could join them. Just to make sure they're not too gentle." Nabiki walked over to the lieutenant. "Do me a favor Noriudo," Nabiki asked. "Give them a half hour." The smile she gave the lieutenant made him shiver. "In the meantime, why don't I show you what we discovered?"</p><p>Lt. Noriudo looked at the broken door for a second then back to Nabiki. "Half an hour." He said. "And if anyone dies, they go back to prison. You all go back to prison."</p><p>Kimi shrugged. "It'll be worth it." She walked from the kitchen. She opened the bottle of water she was carrying, took a swallow then handed it to Nabiki. "Somehow I don't think anyone will die tonight."</p><p>Lt. Noriudo looked back at the broken door again. He shook his head. "Show me what you got."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kenichi Satoh woke up with a snort. Something had awoken him. He reached under his pillow for his gun. His hands began to frantically search when he didn't find it. "Looking for this?" Came a voice. "Who are you?' Kenichi demanded. "How did you get in here?"<p>A figure stepped out of the shadows. He was a muscular young man with his hair in a ponytail. He held the gun. "You know these are illegal in Japan, don't you?" Ranma popped out the clip and tossed it away. "You were responsible for a friend of mine getting hurt." Ranma said menacingly. "Almost killed her." Ranma shook his head as a series of muffled explosions sounded through the mansion. The room shook. "I promised her I wouldn't kill you." Ranma growled. "You don't know how hard it is to keep that promise." An explosion shook the room again.</p><p>"What's happening?" Kenichi got out of the bed and strode angrily toward Ranma. When he got close enough he threw a punch. To Kenichi's surprise his fist was caught in mid air in a vise like grip. Kenichi screamed when Ranma squeezed. The sound of breaking bones seemed louder than the explosion that rocked the room again. Kenichi dropped to the floor in agony when Ranma let go. He cradled his broken hand in his lap.</p><p>Ranma paced around Kenichi. "Like I said, you don't know how hard it is to keep that promise." Ranma's fist lashed out and connected with Kenichi's shoulder. Kenichi screamed as the bones of his shoulder shattered. "Then you went and came after us." Ranma pulled his fist back.</p><p>"That's enough Ran-chan." Ukyo said from the door of the bedroom. "Akane's almost done and the police will be here any minute." Ukyo walked into the room and over to the moaning Kenichi. She grabbed him by the neck and hoisted him to his feet. "Walk." She pushed Kenichi out of the room.</p><p>Despite the pain Kenichi Satoh's eyes widened in disbelief. Half of the mansion was gone. All that remained was a large smoking pile of rubble. Water shot into the air where pipes had burst. His eyes widened further when he saw a woman with short black hair walk over to one of the remaining walls and slam her fist against the wall. There was another explosion and a large chunk of the wall shattered.</p><p>Ukyo hustled Kenichi out of the remains of the house and brought him to where a group of people, his Father and Aunt included, were huddled fearfully together. "This is a warning." Ukyo said. She threw Kenichi onto the ground. "You only get one." There was a giant creaking sound and then the rest of the mansion collapsed. "Next time we won't be so nice."</p><p>Akane came striding out of the rising dust. She noticed Kenichi lying in a pained ball with the other people. She nodded. "We can go now." She said.</p><p>End Chapter 15</p><p>Author's Notes: Hi everyone. Thanks for all the reviews and emails. QR - Book 1 (Just leaving it open, Book 2 does not exist yet) is almost done. An epilogue or two and a side story remain to be posted. The side story will be about the missing span of time between getting out of prison and the NWC going undercover. I put in a couple surprises. I hope you like it.</p><p>An apology to those who I've not yet responded to requests for chapters or in a couple cases the entire story. Unbelievably, I have even had several requests for the entire Couch Trips saga. That particular request may take some time. Anyway, I've been a little busy. Soon. I promise.</p>
