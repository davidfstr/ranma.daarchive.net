</div><p>Chapter 12</p><p>'Jail bait'</p><p>Nabiki Tendo sat at her desk in her office. An untouched drink sat at her elbow, as did an equally untouched lunch. While Nabiki never had or could learn The Soul of Ice, she didn't need it to get her mind racing. There were few who could match her when it came to her ability to concentrate on a problem. And right now Nabiki was concentrating furiously. "How long?" She said to herself.</p><p>"At least six months, probably more." Kimi said from a couch in a conversation pit.</p><p>"Huh?" Nabiki replied.</p><p>"You were thinking out loud again." Kimi said. "You said 'How long', I figured you meant how long has Hikaru been popping in and out of prison. The earliest attack on Pema was about that long ago." Kimi said. "Add a week or two to learn about Pema..." Kimi trailed off. "Why Pema?" She asked.</p><p>"To hurt Ranma." Nabiki replied. "Though I think it also means that Hikaru is not personally executing the attacks. She's be dead if he were." Nabiki pinched the bridge of her nose. "The real question is; is the old ghoul backing Hikaru again?"</p><p>Kimi got up from the couch and walked over to the desk. Kimi walked behind Nabiki and started massaging Nabiki's shoulders. "You're tense." Kimi said after a moment. "You haven't eaten and you're barely sleeping." Kimi leaned closer. "Now, I want you to do both." She ordered. "No buts, Nabs, you need a break and you know it." She said. "We're on alert, Sasuke is watching the penthouse, lover...no, forget that, you need sleep."</p><p>"Spoilsport." Nabiki grumbled. "Okay, okay, a nap, I'll take a nap."</p><p>"Good." Kimi replied firmly. "Well, go on."</p><p>"Yes, mother." Grumbled Nabiki. Nabiki got up and plodded toward the bedroom. She paused at the door. "Don't blame me if it all goes to hell while I'm napping." She said. Nabiki entered the bedroom and closed the door.</p><p>Kimi shook her head and cleaned up Nabiki's desk before sitting down at the desk herself and started reviewing Nabiki's notes. She got so engrossed in what she was reading she didn't hear Tatewaki enter the apartment until he was standing just in front of her. Kimi looked up. "Eep." She squeaked. "Lover!" She scolded. "At least make a little noise." She complained.</p><p>"My apologies, My Lady." Tatewaki replied. He looked around.</p><p>"She's taking a nap." Kimi supplied.</p><p>"Good." Tatewaki replied. "She works too hard." He said. "It is good she has you to watch over her." Tatewaki said approvingly. "Else I fear she'd work herself sick." He said. "Drink?"</p><p>"Short one, lover." Kimi replied. "I know what you mean, if I don't watch her..." Kimi sighed. "Why'd we have to fall in love with a workaholic?" She complained. Tatewaki snorted in amused agreement. She accepted the drink Tatewaki handed her. Kimi sat back in Nabiki's chair and took a sip. "I think we need to get her out of town." She said. "With no laptop." Kimi put her glass down. "In the meantime.." Kimi stood and walked out from behind the desk. "If I know Nabs, she's probably not really napping." She said. "So, let's see if the two of us can distract her enough to get her to really sleep."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Pema, Kagomi and Kiko sat nervously in salon chairs. The three girls were dressed only in terry cloth robes. That wasn't what was making them nervous. Part of what was making them nervous was that Madame Demille had been satisfied with their progress and tonight they were going to the club. Kagomi had almost fainted when she heard the news. The other part was the woman who had just arrived along with Kiko's mother Koko. The newcomer was a middle aged woman dressed in an elegant and expensive kimono in shades yellow and cream. "Oh noes." Pema whispered in nervous awe. "It Ranma mama." Pema scrambled out of the salon chair and bowed so deeply her chin threatened to hit her knees.</p><p>Nodoka walked over to the bowed over Pema. "Look at me, child." Nodoka said. Pema straightened slowly. Nodoka lifted Pema's chin with a finger. Nodoka smiled slightly. "Ranma has already spoken to me about you." She said. "I may not approve but Ranma has made clear his feelings in the matter. Akane and Ukyo were very vocal in their agreement." Nodoka took a breath. "You may call me Mother."</p><p>"Y-yes, M-m-mother. Thank you, Mother." Pema squeaked. Pema licked her lips and gestured toward Kagomi. "Mother, this Pema best friend Kagomi."</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "Ah yes, Ranma mentioned you as well." She said. "You may call me Auntie."</p><p>"Thank you...Auntie." Kagomi replied. 'Damn, this woman is scary.' She thought. Kagomi curtsied the way Madame Demille had shown her. "It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance." She said in as calm tones as she could muster. "Pema has often mentioned how she wished you'd visit more often."</p><p>Nodoka smiled in amusement and a touch of approval. "And Genevieve claimed you were the untrainable one." She murmured. "She is rarely so...spectacularly wrong." She said in a louder voice. Nodoka gave Kagomi an appraising look. "Though she was accurate when she said you were very attractive."</p><p>"Thank you, Auntie." Kagomi replied.</p><p>"Well sit down." Nodoka ordered. "Koko has work to do and not a lot of time." She said. The two girls returned to their seats. "What will you be wearing?" She asked the three girls.</p><p>"Kiko will be wearing blue." Koko said. "She spent the better part of a day trying on every item of clothes in her closet." Kiko continued. "I think you'll approve."</p><p>"I'm sure I will, Koko." Nodoka replied. "And the two of you?"</p><p>"Pema buyed..." Pema began.</p><p>"Bought." Corrected Kagomi. Nodoka raised an eyebrow and gave Kagomi an approving look.</p><p>"Bought." Pema repeated. "Pema bought new blouse for Pema and Kagomi." Pema turned to Kagomi. "Pema hope you like." Pema tried to sit up but Koko pushed her back down. "But..."</p><p>"Just tell us where it is." Koko said. Pema pointed to a corner. "Fine...now look up." Koko started applying make up to Pema's face.</p><p>Nodoka walked over to the corner and picked up a bag that was lying there. She opened it. Nodoka's eyebrow lifted in appreciation. "You picked these out, Pema?"</p><p>"Yes, Mrs...Mother." Pema replied. "Shh." Said Koko sharply. Pema nodded.</p><p>"Impressive." Nodoka murmurred. "The green one is yours, I assume." Nodoka said. "Just nod." Nokoka said. Pema nodded. "And peach would be Kagomi's color." Nodoka walked over to Kagomi and held the blouse next to the girl's face. "Yes, peach would go well with your complexion." Nodoka gave Pema an approving look. "You have an eye." She said to the Tibetan teen. Pema smiled. "Peach with a touch of green." Nodoka said musingly. "I see."</p><p>Koko worked on Pema's face for several long minutes. Koko stopped and stood back. "Well, what do you think?" Koko asked in smug pride.</p><p>Nodoka tilted her head. "Astonishing." She said.</p><p>"Oh. My. God." Breathed Kagomi. Kiko squealed at the same time.</p><p>"I wish I could take credit for it." Koko said.</p><p>"What? What?" Pema said in near panic. Koko spun the chair around so Pema could face the mirror behind her. "Ohhh." Pema breathed. "Is that Pema?" She asked. "Must be Pema." Pema declared. "Her mouth moving like Pema." Pema turned to Kagomi. "Do Pema really look like that?" She asked. Kagomi nodded mutely. Pema turned back to the mirror. "Ohhh."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The limo pulled up in front of 'Ky's Club'. A liveried retainer exited from the front passenger seat and opened the rear door. The first to exit was a little girl of nine or ten. She appeared somewhat self conscious in the blue dress she was wearing. Kiko nervously clutched the small purse she held in her hand. The next person to exit was her mother who took her hand. "Now remember Kiko, your Auntie is counting on you to act like a lady." Admonished Koko.</p><p>Kiko nodded glumly. "Yeah, I know." She grumbled.</p><p>Nodoka, in her usual elegant kimono, this one in shades of yellow and cream, exited the limo. Followed by Pema and Kagomi. The two teens wore similar outfits; a blouse, the ones Pema had purchased, a complimentary skirt that was hemmed slightly above the knees, thigh high stockings and pumps. Nodoka's grudging acceptance of Pema, became grudging and then not so grudging approval of the teen-aged girl. 'Simple yet sophisticated.' She thought. 'Not the whorish look most girls her age adopt.' Nodoka shook her head. 'Not to mention her extraordinary beauty.' Nodoka sighed.</p><p>"Excuse me...Mother." Pema asked hesitantly. "Is something wrong?"</p><p>"No dear." Nodoka replied. "I'm just adjusting to certain...realities." She smiled at the look of confusion on the Tibetan girl's face. "Never mind dear, it's unimportant." She indicated the entrance to the club. "Shall we?"</p><p>"Ohmigod. Ohmigod." Kagomi chattered nervously. "I just know I'm going to do something stupid, I just know it."</p><p>"Kagomi not worry." Pema said firmly. "Just remember what Madame Demille say, then you be fine."</p><p>"Astonishing." Nodoka said under her breath. "Listen to Pema." Nodoka found herself saying. Nodoka led the way into the club. While not dark, it took a moment or two for their eyes to adjust. Kagomi hissed when she saw the big man sitting near the back of the restaurant. "He's huge." She whispered to Pema. Kagomi blinked when she realized the huge man had a companion. A young woman with long black hair was sitting on the huge man's knee. "Omigod, that's Raven."</p><p>"Indeed." Nodoka replied. "Good evening Abe, Rei." Nodoka greeted the incongruous pair.</p><p>"Good evening Auntie." Chorused Abe and Rei.</p><p>Rei hopped off Abe's lap. "I'll talk to you later baby." Rei said to the huge man. "Hey Koko, Kiko." Rei greeted the stylist and her daughter. Rei took a look at the two teen girls. Rei blinked. Rei blinked again. "Whoa." She breathed. "Better keep a close watch on these two, Auntie." She said.</p><p>"I intend to." Nodoka replied.</p><p>"Open the door, baby." Rei said to Abe. "We have an entrance to make." Rei waited until Abe opened the door to the inner club then led the group inside. Compared to the comfortable muted lighting of the outer club, the inner club was ablaze with light and it took the arrivals a second or so before their eyes adjusted.</p><p>"It's...it's..." Kagomi stopped as she groped for a proper adjective. "Omigod." She squealed quietly.</p><p>"Breath, Kagomi, breath." Nodoka said in amused sympathy. "It is, isn't it?" She said impishly. Kagomi nodded and looked around wide eyed. Nodoka led them to her private table. "Sit, I'll go inform Kodachi you've arrived." Nodoka said. "Rei, if you would remain with them?" She asked. "I may be awhile."</p><p>"Of course Auntie." Rei replied.</p><p>Nodoka nodded and walked away leaving the three girls in the company of Rei. As far as Kagomi was concerned life couldn't have been better. She was in the club, with Pema and in the presence of Rei Ayami. Kagomi sighed. "Thanks Pema." She whispered.</p><p>Nodoka walked to Kodachi's office, knocked on the door and then let herself in. "Well they're here." Nodoka said after greeting Kodachi. "Rei's with them."</p><p>Kodachi chuckled in amusement. "You look like you've bitten into a lemon." She observed. "Was being nice to Pema that difficult?" She asked.</p><p>"Unfortunately, no." Nodoka said sourly. "She's everything Ranma and Akane said she was. Sweet, intelligent , and almost painfully attractive." Nodoka sighed. "Hating her would be like hating a puppy." She shook her head. "To make matters worse, she was obviously terrified of offending me in any way." Nodoka sighed again.</p><p>"Someone needs her boys." Noriko said in amusement from the couch. "Where are they, anyway?"</p><p>"They'll be here." Nodoka replied. "Later." She said grumpily.</p><p>There was a knock on the door. The door opened and Fumie stuck her head in. "Excuse me, Auntie, but we are getting inquiries." She said. "Lots of inquiries." She held up a fist full of envelopes. "You'd think they hadn't seen a pretty girl before." She complained. Fumie walked over and placed the envelopes on Kodachi's desk. "And they've been here what, ten minutes?" Fumie shook her head.</p><p>"Oh dear." Kodachi, Noriko and Nodoka chorused. "They're sixteen Fumie." Nodoka informed the waitress.</p><p>"Oh like any of them care." Fumie replied. "All that'll do is make them bid higher." She said. "Where did you find them?" She asked. "Especially the Chinese girl, she's gorgeous."</p><p>"You don't recognize her?" Kodachi replied. "That's Pema."</p><p>"You joke." Fumie said in disbelief. "The babysitter?" Fumie began to giggle. "Ohhh my." She grinned like a chipmunk. "Oh, tonight is going to be a lot of fun." She said. "Can we assume U.S.A. will be showing up?"</p><p>"It's a distinct possibility." Nodoka replied. "Let the girls know." She smiled. "In the meantime." She held her hand out. "The envelopes." She said. "Let's, at least, see what they think they're worth."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Pema and Kagomi sat in the private booth chatting with Rei and taking in the sights afforded by Ky's club. "It's as wonderful as I imagined." Kagomi gushed. "More." She added. Kagomi looked at Rei with awe written on her face. "I-I hope you're not upset having to babysit us."</p><p>"Upset?" Rei laughed. "A little jealous maybe, but not upset."</p><p>"Jealous?" Kagomi asked in confused tones. "Why would you be jealous?"</p><p>"You don't know, do you." Rei said in amusement. "Honey, every guy in this place has been staring at the two of you since you walked in." She said. "Isn't that right, Koko?" The older woman nodded cheerfully. "If you two were working here, you'd be very, very popular."</p><p>"Would I be popular, Mommy?" Kiko asked innocently.</p><p>Koko sighed. "Probably." She muttered under her breath. "The club is not for you." She told Kiko sternly. "Ms. Kuno has other things planned for you." She said. "Such as going to college."</p><p>"Blehh." Complained Kiko.</p><p>"No blehh." Scolded Pema. "Kiko not know how lucky she am."</p><p>"Is." Corrected Kagomi absently.</p><p>"Is." Pema said. "Pema not want hear blehh again."</p><p>"Yes, Pema." Kiko said contritely. "Sorry, Pema."</p><p>"That better." Pema said. "Still, club very nice." Pema continued. "Pema think of many worse places to work."</p><p>Koko and Rei exchanged looks. "Excuse us, but Kiko and I need to visit the ladies room." Koko said. "No arguments, young lady." She said as Kiko made to protest. "Rei, needs to talk to Pema and Kagomi." She eased out of the booth and, taking Kiko by the hand, walked away.</p><p>"Pema say something wrong?" Pema asked in concern.</p><p>"You know Pema, for all the things you've been through, you still can be awful innocent." Kagomi said with a touch of sarcasm in her voice. "I think Rei is supposed to tell us what the girls do here." She looked at the singer. "I saw several girls go with guys through that door." She pointed with her chin. "Am I getting warm, Rei?"</p><p>"Very warm." Rei replied. She looked at Pema. "This is a gentleman's club, Pema." Rei began.</p><p>"Pema not as innocent as Kagomi say." Pema interrupted. "Pema see same thing as Kagomi see." Pema said. "Pema know what girls do. It what Pema almost do. Yes?" Pema said. "Pema also see girls not drugged. Pema see girls smile with real smile." Pema shrugged. "Pema mean what Pema say, many, many worse places to work." Pema looked toward where Koko and Kiko has walked off to. "Ranma tell Pema about Koko. How Koko got scar."</p><p>"How did Koko get that scar?" Kagomi asked. Kagomi's eyes suddenly widened in understanding. "Koko used to work here?' She asked.</p><p>"No!" Rei shook her head sharply. "No, Koko worked the streets." Rei said. "Her pimp did that." Rei leaned forward. "If she had worked here, it would never have happened." Rei said firmly. "Our clients know better than to try to hurt one of us."</p><p>"Us?" Kagomi said. "You mean...you?"</p><p>Rei grinned and nodded. "Of course, if they want me, they're gonna pay and pay large." Rei chuckled. "And if you think I'm expensive, you should see what Makoto used to charge. Before Genji took her off the market that is." Rei pointed to a table where a middle aged man and two women sat. "See the tall one? That's Makoto."</p><p>Kagomi and Pema turned their heads. "My gods, she's beautiful." Kagomi said. "Almost as beautiful as Pema."</p><p>Pema giggled. "Kagomi getting very nice reward later." She said. "Kagomi right, Ma-ma..." Pema paused. "Makoto." Supplied Rei. Pema nodded. "Makoto very pretty." Pema smiled proudly. "But Ranma even prettier, Ranma get most money." She declared.</p><p>"No kidding." Rei agreed. "Every time Ranma comes in here..." Rei laughed. "I think the last offer was two million yen." Rei sat back and gave Pema a look. "You really aren't as innocent as you look."</p><p>"Busted." Kagomi said cheerfully."You mean, all the girls who work here..." Kagomi paused.</p><p>"We usually say entertain." Rei supplied. "Almost all." She said. "But yes." Pema and Kagomi exchanged looks before returning their attention to Rei. "Disappointed?" She asked.</p><p>Kagomi and Pema exchanged looks again. Kagomi shrugged. "Not really." Kagomi replied. "I mean, Ranma and the girls really are strippers." Kagomi pointed out with a slight blush. "And you really are a singer."</p><p>"Good one too." Rei said cheerfully.</p><p>Kagomi nodded in enthusiastic agreement. "I have all your songs you know." She gushed. "You really don't have to..."</p><p>"Entertain." Prompted Rei.</p><p>"Entertain." Kagomi shrugged slightly. "Yeah, you don't have to entertain." Kagomi pointed out. She stopped at the grin that appeared on Rei's face. "You like it don't you?" Rei nodded cheerfully. "Don't you want a boyfriend or something?" She asked plaintively.</p><p>"Got one. Good one too." Rei replied in satisfied tones. "You met him."</p><p>"The bouncer?" Kagomi exclaimed. Rei nodded. "He's huge." Kagomi said.</p><p>Rei shrugged. "I like big men." She said simply. "Besides, Botan treats me good, doesn't get jealous and is a pretty damn good lover."</p><p>"Botan?" Kagomi asked. "His name is Botan?" Kagomi giggled. "Sounds like a Sumo wrestler's name." She stopped giggling. "Come to think of it, he's big enough." She looked at Rei. "Oseki." The singer said cheerfully. "Whoa." Breathed Kagomi.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi looked up at the knock on the door. "Auntie?" Came a young voice. "Are you in there?" Kodachi all but ran to the door and opened it. "Kiko!" Kodachi exclaimed happily. "My, don't you look pretty."</p><p>"I think I look dumb." Kiko said moodily. "I wanted to wear my black dress but it was at the cleaners."</p><p>"Well I think you look very nice." Kodachi said firmly. "Where's your mother?" She asked.</p><p>"Mommy went back to Auntie Nodoka's table to keep Pema and Kagomi company." Kiko smiled. "Mommy said I should stay with you." Kiko walked into the office. "Hi Auntie Noriko."</p><p>"Hey kiddo." Noriko replied. "I think your mommy had a good idea." She said. "Why don't you keep Auntie Kodachi company while Auntie Nodoka and I go out into the club?" Noriko stood up. "Coming Nodoka?"</p><p>"Just a moment." Nodoka replied. She gathered up several envelopes and dumped the rest into a trash can. "Oh, don't look at me like that, I just thought the girls might find it...interesting." Nodoka said slightly self consciously. She followed Noriko to the door. She looked back at Kodachi and Kiko, smiled, and followed Noriko out of the office and into the club.</p><p>Noriko and Nodoka took their time returning to the private booth. Nodoka, especially, often stopped to greet a familiar face. At one table she stopped and waved one of the bid sheets. "Noburo." Kodachi greeted the man. He was middle aged, portly and slightly balding. He was also one of the richest men in Tokyo and not someone Kodachi would want to be...upset. She kissed the man on the cheeks and sat down. Noriko leaned a hip on the table.</p><p>"Good news? I hope." Noburo said in anticipation.</p><p>"Unfortunately, no." Nodoka said in tones of regret. "But only because they are not,as yet, accepting clients." Nodoka said. "Nor have they indicated that they'd wish me to act as...intermediary." She said. "So, as you can see, your offer, which I must say was most generous, is a bit premature."</p><p>"Oh." The man replied in disappointed tones. "You will inform me if and when they decide to accept clients." The man continued.</p><p>"Of course we will." Noriko replied. Noriko fished a card out of her pocket, looked at it, then handed it to Noburo. "Though if Chinese girls are what you're looking for..." Noriko grinned. "This week." Noburo laughed. "Why don't you visit this address?" Noriko said. "The new manager has an eye for Chinese girls." She said. "I don't think you'll be disappointed."</p><p>"In the meantime, I understand Suki is looking for a new client." Nodoka said. "And I do remember you expressing a fondness for redheads." Noboru laughed again. Then nodded. "Excellent." Nodoka said. She stood. "I will send her over right away." She bowed. "If you'll excuse us?" She asked. The man bowed in response.</p><p>Nodoka and Noriko continued toward the private booth, though they did stop Fumie and asked her to find Suki. Confident that all would be taken care of, Nodoka and Noriko finally returned to the private booth. Rei, Koko, Pema and Kagomi were sitting and chatting like old friends. Pema and Kagomi had wide smiles on their faces, though Pema's smile dropped as soon as she saw Nodoka. Pema almost jumped to her feet to bow.</p><p>"You don't need to bow every time you see me." Nodoka said with a touch of amusement in her voice. "Sit, sit." She said. Pema nervously returned to her seat. Nodoka and Noriko sat down at the table, with Nodoka sitting next to Pema. "I hope you ladies are enjoying yourselves."</p><p>"Oh yes, Mrs..." Kagomi began and then stopped at Nodoka's raised finger. "I mean, Auntie." She blushed at Nodoka's murmurred 'better'. "Everyone has been very friendly." She giggled. "It really isn't what I expected."</p><p>Nodoka smiled. "And you, Pema, are you enjoying yourself?"</p><p>"Oh, yes Mother." Pema said earnestly. "But, and I hope Mother no mind, but Ranma want me be called Jewel when I out." She bowed in her seat. "Please forgive me for not saying sooner."</p><p>"Jewel?" Nodoka murmured. "I can see why." She smiled. "Jewel it is." She declared. "Rei will make sure you are addressed properly."</p><p>"Hey." Complained Kagomi. "How come I don't have a 'going out' name?"</p><p>Pema giggled. "Not want give Kagomi name without talking to Kagomi first." She said. "But Pema, I mean Jewel think, if Jewel, Jewel, then Kagomi...Gem?" Pema raised her wrist to show her charm bracelet. "That why Jewel get charm."</p><p>"Jewel and Gem?" Rei said. "Wait until our clients hear that." She murmured. "The bids'll go through the roof."</p><p>"Bids?" Kagomi asked.</p><p>Nadoko placed several cards on the table. "This club is, shall we say, very upscale and very discreet." Nodoka said. "We cater to the wealthy, the influential and the powerful." She continued. "The girls who work here are as much companions as, um..." Nodoka paused. "Let us just say, bed partners." She said finally. Pema and Kagomi giggled. "As such, the girls are not paid for individual services, so much as the client pays a fee for...access to the girl." She said. "It's a somewhat exclusive arrangement."</p><p>"Really?" Kagomi said wide-eyed. "But I saw one girl go off with two different men."</p><p>"That would be Ami." Nodoka replied. "But I digress." She said. "If a client is interested in a particular girl he bids on their services. That's assuming she is willing to add another client, of course. The client then deposits the bid amount into a special account. The girl herself is paid by the club. No money changes hands." She smiled. "If a client wishes to tip a girl, that's his perogative, but it's not required." She said. "But as long as he continues to pay the..." Nodoka waved a hand in a way that conveyed some amusement. "The retainer fee, all the client need do is call to see if she's available."</p><p>"Are you saying someone has bid on P-Jewel and me?" Kagomi asked. In response Nodoka placed one of the bid slips she was carrying in front of Kagomi. Kagomi picked it up. Her mouth dropped open. "For me?" She choked out. "This can't be right."</p><p>"Not enough?" Rei asked with a smile. Kagomi passed the slip over to Rei. Rei looked at it. "Not bad." She said in appreciation. "About average." She said. "For one of our better girls." She grinned. "On the other hand...Jewel and Gem...sounds like a team." Pema and Kagomi exchanged blushing looks. Rei grinned. "Teams get paid more."</p><p>"A lot more." Koko added.</p><p>"Regardless, you are both too young for consideration." Nodoka said firmly. "We are skirting things just by allowing you in here in the first place." Nodoka said. "Still both Ms. Kuno." Nodoka looked at Pema apologetically. "And my son, feel it was time you were...introduced to. um, society."</p><p>Suddenly Rei's head snapped up and toward the door to the outer club. "Botan's arguing with someone." She said suddenly.</p><p>"I don't hear anything." Kagomi said in complaint.</p><p>"Rei has exceptional hearing." Nodoka commented. "Are they still arguing, Rei?"</p><p>"No, now they're fighting." Rei reached under the table and pressed a button and a series of lights along the wall began to blink. A thump as if something had banged into the door was heard. "You guys better get down." Rei said. "Anyone who can get by Botan is not someone to take lightly." She said in worried tones.</p><p>"Oh dear." Nodoka said. "I wish my boys were here." She said. "I'd even take Genma."</p><p>Pema and Kagomi looked at each other. Pema nodded and the two girls stood and walked to the head of the booth. There was a ringing sound and the two girls now each held an open fan. "You not worry, Mother." Pema said. "Gem and Jewel protect you."</p><p>"Maybe, but who's going to protect you?" Countered Nodoka. Nodoka reached under the booth and pulled out a long, wrapped object. She unwrapped it to reveal a samurai sword. "Rei. Stay behind us. " She said to the singer just as the door to the outer club exploded inwards and the burly bouncer pinwheeled helplessly into the club and crashed into a table. Screams and shouts began to rise from the guests to mix with the screams and shouts that already existed in the outer club.</p><p>A tall, powerfully built man strode arrogantly into the club. His entire posture radiated confidence that none could prevent him from taking what he wanted and dire warning to any who would try. His eyes scanned the club and stopped when he espied Pema and Kagomi. "Ah, there you are." He said in satisfaction. He strode toward Pema. "It'll be a shame to lose you, sweet cheeks, but Ranma needs to be taught a lesson."</p><p>"I would suggest you stop now." An angry female voice said. The man turned. A woman in a black catsuit and wearing a feathered mask resembling a golden eagle strode toward the man. A ribbon dangled from her hand.</p><p>"Who are you supposed to be?" The man said in contempt.</p><p>"Sometimes they call me Ina-washi." The masked woman replied in calm tones. "Hikaru Nakamura."</p><p>"Ina-washi?" The man asked. He laughed harshly. "You could call yourself Kami-sama for all the difference it'll make." He said dismissively. "You're still just a cunt." He smiled coldly, literally as the room temperature seemed to drop.</p><p>"Just?" The masked woman replied. "There is nothing 'just' about me." She smiled. "Isn't that right, Hayabusa?"</p><p>"That's what I've always said." Another woman said as she stepped out of a corner. She too was wearing a black catsuit and feathered mask.</p><p>The man seemed to smile contemptuously. It was hard to tell since there was almost no expression on his face, but the feeling was there. "So there are two of you."</p><p>"Three." Another masked catsuited woman said.</p><p>"Four." Said another. And then one catsuited woman after another started appearing from doors and corners and, in the case of two women, under a table. The two women from under the table leaned over to kiss the middle aged man seated at the table on the cheeks before turning toward the gangster. The man himself glared balefully at Hikaru.</p><p>"Hikaru, honey!" Exclaimed another voice. Into the room slinked three women. One buxom and redheaded and wearing red shorts and a red t-shirt, one slim and brunette wearing a silver-white version of the same outfit and the third muscular and with hair so black it had a blue sheen. She too wore a similar outfit only in blue. "See Tomboy, I told you he'd take the bait." The redhead said to the muscular girl.</p><p>"Ranma!" Growled Hikaru as his anger temporarily took him out of the soul of ice.</p><p>"You gotta work on your control." Chided Ranma. Ranma turned her head to look at Pema. "You okay, Punkin?" Pema smiled and nodded. "Now you stay with Mom." Ranma returned his attention to Hikaru Nakamura. "You really are an idiot, did you know that?" She said. "No backup, no reserves...no plan." She rolled her eyes. "Let me guess, you figured since the boss here is a woman..." Ranma rolled her eyes again. "You know, you're not really worth the effort." She looked at the masked woman who called herself Ina-washi. "Nice outfit." She said. "Mind telling me where you got it?"</p><p>"Later." The masked woman replied. "After we take out the trash." She said.</p><p>"Do you really believe a bunch of whores can beat me?" Hikaru spat. He took a breath and again a chill seemed to descend around him.</p><p>"What I believe is unimportant." The woman called Inu-Washi replied. "What I know is." She smiled behind the mask. "And what I know is that my girls are going to..." She turned her head. "Hayabusa, what was that phrase?"</p><p>"Hand him his head?" The other masked woman replied. "Kick his butt?"</p><p>"Kick his butt, kick his butt." Piped a childish voice from the ceiling. Hikaru looked up. There was another catsuited figure sitting in a chandelier. It was obviously a child even behind the yellow feathered mask. The incongruity immediately shocked Hikaru out of the Soul of Ice once again.</p><p>"Piyo-Piyo." Scolded Ina-washi. "I thought you were going to stay behind."</p><p>"Are you starting to get the picture, Hikaru?" Ranma said. She walked over to Hikaru, hips swaying. "You're a joke." She declared. "A nothing." Ranma sighed. "And I had such hopes." Ranma nonchelantly blocked a quick fist strike from the assassin. "Too slow." Ranma sneered. "See, that's what I mean, you're stupid." Ranma said. Before Hikaru could react, before he could even blink, Ranma slid an arm under Hikaru's armpit, twisted his hips and Hikaru found his arm behind his back and his face rubbing against the floor. Hikaru twisted his head and tried to break free but Ranma held him fast. "See? Stupid, even Pig Boy wouldn't have fallen for that." Ranma taunted.</p><p>"If you were smart, you would have done some recon first, seen how strong I had gotten, maybe even looked for someone to train ya." Ranma continued. Hikaru just glared at Ranma in response. "Oh, did you look?" Ranma laughed. "And you couldn't find the old ghoul." Ranma said knowingly. "That shoulda told ya something right off." Ranma released the hold and tossed Hikaru to the floor.</p><p>"The old bitch is probably still in China." Growled Hikaru. He raised a hand to wipe at his mouth. He looked at his hand to see blood. "What are you laughing at?" He snapped as Ranma, Akane and Ukyo broke into laughter.</p><p>"Shampoo showed up a couple weeks ago." Akane said from the side. "Which means, Cologne is around as well." Akane laughed. "I wouldn't be surprised if she's here." Akane looked around. "Well, Gos is here." She waved to an apparently vacant corner. "And, yep, there's Cologne." Akane pointed to another vacant spot. In response a figure appeared in the corner.</p><p>"Very good, Akane Tendo." Cologne pogoed toward the group on her staff. "My granddaughter was correct in her assessment. You've become much stronger." Cologne looked at Ranma. "What are your plans for Hikaru?"</p><p>"Why?" Ranma asked. "You want him?"</p><p>"Actually...yes." Cologne replied. "But, I believe it's neither yours nor my decision." Cologne looked at the leader of the masked women. "I believe the decision belongs to Ms. Kuno." She said. "He did kill Ky Young Ji, after all." Suddenly Cologne lashed out with her staff as Hikaru tried to move away. The assassin froze in place. "We are not through with you." She told the now paralyzed man. "As I was saying, the decision is yours, Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"What will you do with him?" The feather masked woman asked.</p><p>"With your permission he will have a long and useful life in the village." Cologne replied. "I give you my word he will never trouble you again."</p><p>The masked woman walked into the circle and bent down to look at the paralyzed Hikaru Nakamura. "When you killed...murdered...Ky...I wanted his killer dead and, failing that, for my own life to end." Kodachi reached up and slowly removed the bird mask. "For better or for worse, I have been denied both." She said. Suddenly Kodachi's gloved hand lashed out and along the side of the gunmen's face. A long jagged and bloody furrow appeared in her hand's wake. "That could have just as easily been your throat." She hissed. Kodachi straightened and turned her back on Hikaru. "Take...it away."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Botan Abe opened his eyes with a wince. "Why am I always ending up on the floor?" He grumbled. The big man slowly realized his head was pillowed on something soft. "Rei?" He asked.</p><p>"Who else would it be?" The singer replied. "Welcome back, baby." She said. "You missed all the fun."</p><p>Abe struggled to a sitting position. After his head stopped spinning he looked around. "What happened?" He asked. "Last thing I remember was fighting this guy..." Abe stopped suddenly and looked around again. Nothing appeared damaged. "No fight?" He asked in confusion.</p><p>"Well you fought him, baby." Rei replied. "But...turns out Ranma was setting a trap." She smiled. "I'll tell you about it later." Her smile became impish. "Unless you're not feeling well enough to take me home." She giggled when Abe almost jumped to his feet. "I guess you're not tired of me yet, huh?"</p><p>"The only reason I'd be tired of you is cause I'm dead." The big man replied. "I suppose I should say good-night to Ms. Kuno first." He said. With Rei holding possessively to his arm, Abe walked over to where Kodachi Kuno, still wearing her black catsuit, was talking to a number of people. "Ms. Kuno." He said.</p><p>"Abe." Kodachi said in concerned tones. "Should you be up?" She asked. "You received quite a blow from that, that creature."</p><p>"I'm fine, Ms. Kuno." Abe replied. "I'm sorry I failed you."</p><p>"Failed me?" Kodachi raised an eyebrow. "Botan Abe, if you hadn't delayed him as long as you had, we would have had real trouble." She said firmly. "To be honest, I'm impressed you held him off as long as you did." She said. "Whether you realize it or not, you held off someone nearly as powerful as Ranma." She made a dismissive gesture. "There is no need to apologize, and more than enough reason to praise you." She said. "Now, I want you to go home..." She looked at Rei. "And, Miss Ayami notwithstanding, get some rest."</p><p>"Yes, Ma'am." Abe replied. Abe turned and with Rei clinging to his arm left the club.</p><p>"He's hurt worse then he's letting on." Noriko said in an aside to Kodachi. "Normally Rei rides on his shoulder." She pointed out.</p><p>"Rei will watch him." Kodachi replied confidently. "Bit of an anti-climax, wouldn't you agree?" She commented. "Almost boring."</p><p>Noriko shook her head. "Boring is fine." She said firmly. "And the only climaxing I want is in bed." She said with feeling. "Anti or otherwise."</p><p>Kodachi chuckled. "Liar." She responded affectionately. "You love the excitement and you know it." She said. "Though I do agree with you about the climaxing." She sighed. "Too bad Kinnikun is out of town." She said. Kodachi made a face. "We really need someone closer to hand, so to speak."</p><p>Noriko nodded. "No kidding." She agreed. "Kinnikun is nice and all that, but too far away." She said. "It takes all the sponteneity out of it." She griped.</p><p>"Exactly." Agreed Kodachi. "Oh well, I suppose it'll just have to be you and I tonight." She said in mock disappointment.</p><p>"Oh good." Noriko replied. She linked her arm through Kodachi's. "Maybe we should put our names out for bids." Noriko said in thoughtful tones. "For just such an occasion. I bet the bids will be...spectacular." Kodachi chuckled in response. Kodachi paused and then nodded. "Oh good." Noriko said cheerfully.</p><p>The two women strolled arm in arm through the club. Most of the girls had changed out of their catsuits and back into their 'work' clothes. Fumie and Miki were at the concierge station. Makoto and Yuki were back at their table with Genji. While Ami and Aoi were sitting at the bar chatting with the other, regular girls. Kodachi and Noriko stopped at the bar. "Anyone who wants to go home, can." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Is the club closing?" One of the girls asked worriedly.</p><p>"Maybe for a day or two." Kodachi replied. "I wouldn't be too concerrned." She told the regular girls. "I know, why don't you all take a small vacation?" She said. "A couple days at an Onsen, perhaps?" She said. "The club will pay."</p><p>"Thank you, Ms. Kuno." Chorused the regular girls.</p><p>Finally, Noriko and Kodachi made it to the private booth, where Nodoka, Koko, Kiko, Ranma, Akane, Ukyo, Pema and Kagomi were sitting. They sat down at the table next to Akane, Ranma and Ukyo. "I'm surprised you haven't left already." Kodachi said to Akane.</p><p>"What, without saying goodnight to our hostess?" Akane said with a smile. "That would be rude."</p><p>Kodachi snorted. "Indeed." Kodachi looked around the table. Kodachi nodded toward Pema and Kagomi. The two teen girls were in animated conversation with Nodoka. "It seems Auntie approves of your two...proteges."</p><p>"I suppose it has something to do with how they stood up to defend her." Akane pointed out. "Remind us to thank your brother for their training." Akane said. Kodachi nodded proudly. "And thank you," Akane continued. "For everything you've done too."</p><p>"Thank you, Akane." Kodachi replied. She nodded agan toward Pema and Kagomi. "There was great interest among the clientelle." She said in leading tones.</p><p>"Up to them." Ranma replied. "When they're eighteen." She smiled. "Until then I see no harm with them paying a visit to your club; every so often." Ranma raised an inquiriing eyebrow. Kodachi smiled wryly. She nodded. " I assume they can continue their lessons?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Certainly." Kodachi replied. "It will only serve to raise their value." She said. "Not to mention that it will ensure Kiko continues with her lessons as well." She gave Ranma an inquiring look. "Forgive me if I express surprise about your attitude."</p><p>"I don't know why you're surprised." Akane answered. "We love Pema, but we don't own her." She said. Ranma and Ukyo nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Not to mention, my Mom will make sure she finds a good man." Ranma said. "Just like she did for Makoto." Ranma grinned. "Heck, if you let her, she'd probably find husbands for all your girls."</p><p>Kodachi and Noriko laughed. "No doubt." Kodachi said in agreement.</p><p>"Pema." Ranma called to get the Tibetan girl's attention. "The girl's and I are going home." Ranma raised a hand. "Why don't you and Kagomi finish up your weekend, okay?" She said. "We'll see you Monday." She continued when Pema, after a moments hesitation and a look toward Kagomi, nodded. "Excellent." Ranma stood. Akane and Ukyo joined him. "Mom, you still coming to dinner next week?" Nodoka nodded. "Okay, later everyone."</p><p>Pema watched Ranma, Akane and Ukyo leave the club. Pema smiled at how closely Ranma and Akane walked together. The dark haired Akane's arm around the redhead's waist. Her smile widened further when she saw that Ranma was holding Ukyo's hand. She nodded. 'Good. All is well with my gods.' She thought. Though she would have gladly gone with them if they had asked, she was just as happy to remain behind. Besides enjoying being at the club, there was Kagomi and Kiko to consider. Pema turned to another reason why she was happy to remain behind. "Mother coming to dinner?" Pema asked. "That wonderful." Pema added when Nodoka nodded. "Pema help Ukyo." Pema declared happily. "Not that Pema cook like Ukyo."</p><p>"No one does." Kagomi said in agreement.</p><p>"She does have a gift." Agreed Nodoka. "Still I'm surprised you didn't leave with them, Kagomi notwithstanding."</p><p>Pema smiled. "Gods need time together." She said simply. "There be plenty time for Pema." She said cheerfully.</p><p>"Still, I was given to believe that Ranma had chosen...you." Nodoka said in slightly flustered tones.</p><p>Pema nodded cheerfully. "Pema, Ranma's woman." She declared. "Ohh." She exclaimed in sudden understanding."Mother think Ranma make Pema number one girl?" She guessed. Nodoka nodded slowly. Pema shook her head. "Oh no, Mother, Pema never be first in Ranma heart." She declared. "That Akane place." She said. "Pema know. Ukyo know." She shook her head in emphasis. "Pema just happy Ranma think Pema good enough to be Ranma woman." She said. "That more than enough for Pema." She said. Pema looked at Nodoka speculatively. "Is that why Mother want Pema say; Mother?" She asked. Nodoka nodded. "Oh." Pema said in slightly disappointed tones. "Maybe Pema say Auntie, like other girls?"</p><p>Nodoka chewed her lip thoughtfully for a moment. Finally she shook her head. "No, I think Mother is appropriate." She said.</p><p>Pema smiled widely. "Thank you, Mother."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki stood at the bow of his yacht watching the horizon. He was dressed, as was his wont, in his swordsman's garb. Once an affectation, time and experience transformed the man to fit the clothing. His hands were clasped loosely behind his back. Tatewaki turned his head slowly at the sound of approaching steps. Tatewaki smiled and turned to face the two approaching women. "My Ladies." Tatewaki said in pleased greeting.</p><p>"My Lord." Nabiki and Kimi chorused. The two women were dressed in white cotton gowns that covered them from neck to the deck. The outfits seemed to cling to their bodies so closely that they appeared almost painted on. The two women flanked Tatewaki. A liveried retainer hurried over with a wine bucket, glasses and table. It seemed mere moments before they were holding glasses. The retainer bowed himself away.</p><p>Nabiki turned and gently leaned a hand on the railing. "I love watching the sunset from here." Nabiki said musingly. "it's so peaceful." She sighed. "Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?"</p><p>"Every day, My Lady." Tatewaki replied with a smile. "Whenever I am blessed with your presence, My Lady." He said. "Or the presence of My Lady Kimi."</p><p>"Ooh, smooth, lover." Kimi laughed quietly.</p><p>"Smooth, perhaps." Tatewaki replied. "But still the truth." He said. "Sometimes I feel as if this is but a dream. A beautiful dream but a dream nonetheless. And one I am doomed to awaken from." He shook his head. "forgive me, My Ladies, I wax meloncholy." He said contritely. "The night is too young and my ladies too beautiful for me to spoil with such gloomy words."</p><p>"Problems, lover?" Nabiki asked in concern.</p><p>Tatewaki smiled. "Problems, My Lady?" He asked. "Nay, rather struck humble by the sheer number of ways I've been blessed." He said. "Not a day goes by where I don't ask; what great deed did I do in some past life to deserve the life I have today?"</p><p>"You were probably a Kuno." Nabiki replied. "Isnt that right, My Lady Kimi?" Nabiki said with a fond smile.</p><p>"No doubt about it, My Lady Nabiki." Kimi replied in return.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>HIkaru Nakamura slowly returned to consciousness. He sat up and a wave of nausea rolled over him causing him to roll over and retch helplessly. Hikaru wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, took a deep breath and again tried to get to his feet. Hikaru staggered unsteadily. "What did that old bitch do to me?" He muttered. HIkaru paused at hearing his voice. "My voice!" He stammered. "Wh-what's wrong with my voice?" A horrible suspicion dawned on the former hitman and he gingerly started patting his body. "No." He whispered. "No!" He screamed as his hands located physical features he shouldn't have had. His hand descended to his crotch. "No!" He screamed again. "Not again." Hikaru started beating his fists against the walls of the small room he was in. "You bitch." He screamed. "Change me back." He demanded in near hysteria. "Change me back."</p><p>There was the sound of something sliding open and light came into the darkened room from a slit in the door. "Ah, great grand daughter, you are awake." Came Cologne's dry voice.</p><p>Hikaru threw herself at the door. "Don't call be great granddaughter, you bitch." She screamed at the opening. "When this shit wears off..." She threatened.</p><p>"Wears off, great grand daughter?" Cologne's ancient voice held amusement and a touch of impatience. "Why would I make you female just to have it wear off?" She said. "I promised Kodachi Kuno you'd have a long useful life in the village." Cologne said. "And what would be more useful than for you to have many, many children?" She said. Cologne cackled. "You're going to be a very popular girl in the village, Hikaru Nakamura, a very popular girl."</p><p>End Chapter 12</p><p>Author's Notes: Well this arc is done...Oh there is a sidestory, the wedding of Nabiki and Tatewaki but this story line is done. It's been fun everyone. Other news, the Couch Trip bug hit me. Got a story started. Don't know when it'll be done but...well stay tuned.</p><p>Henry</p>
