</div><p>Part 3</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>'The rot within'</p><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight." The pretty reporter said. "I'm your host Satchi Kato." She swivled her chair to face another camera. Images appeared on the screen behind her. Most were of hard faced men in business suits. "The Yakusa." The reporter said in identification. The image changed to an attractive young woman with dark hair styled in a helmet cut. "And the Ice Queen." The reported looked down at her notes for a second. "Ms. Tendo, the future Lady Kuno, has continued to deny any connection but rumors persist." She said. "Tonight's topic; Nabiki Tendo, Criminal Mastermind or the target of jealous slander." She said. "When we come back."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Nabiki and Kimi looked up as the door to their office opened seemingly on its' own, no one appeared to be there. Nabiki looked at the screen of her laptop. "Hello Gos." She said. "Did you get what I asked for?" An envelope appeared on the desk in front of Nabiki.</p><p>"The cameras see me?" Gos said in his sepulchral voice. "It shouldn't be possible."</p><p>"Infra red." Kimi said from her own laptop. She also did not look up. She snorted. "And even then we needed to find something really sensitive. You're barely above room temperature." She said in complaint.</p><p>Nabiki picked up the envelope. "It's not Pema, I hope."</p><p>"No." Gos replied in a faint voice. "Another girl." Gos intoned. "Younger." He said. "Less...developed."</p><p>"Sick bastard." Growled Kimi.</p><p>"I have been called similar names." Gos' voice contained a hint of amusement.</p><p>"You're just a voyeur, Gos." Kimi replied. "In my book that puts you in the 'mostly harmless' category." Kimi took a breath. "And you're sure it's Tokio?"</p><p>"Very sure." Gos' said in cold tones.</p><p>"Thank you Gos." Nabiki said. "Kimi will transfer your fee into your account tonight."</p><p>'Thank you." Gos replied. "InfraRed? Hmm, I must work on that." A moment later the door to Nabiki's office opened and closed. Nabiki kept her eyes on the monitor for several moments after. Finally Nabiki leaned back in her chair and looked at Kimi. "Well we learned two things today." She said.</p><p>"Tokio being a freak is one." Kimi replied. "What's the other?"</p><p>"That as long as we don't try looking at Gos we can remember he's here." Nabiki picked up the envelope and grimaced. "You realize I'm going to have to look at it anyway, don't you?" She said in tones of disgust. "Just to be sure."</p><p>"We'll look at it, together." Kimi said in emphasis. "And if it's as bad as I think it will be, then we'll get drunk."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Thank you for coming, Kyoshi." Nabiki said.</p><p>"You said it was important, Ice Queen." Kyoshi Nerumi replied. The Yakusa lord looked around. "I'm surprised Tokio isn't here already. He's usually the first to arrive." He accepted a glass of cognac from Kimi as he sat down in a comfortable chair.</p><p>"That's because he wasn't invited." Nabiki replied. She sat down opposite Kyoshi and sipped her own drink. "We have a problem, Kyoshi." Nabiki said in cool tones. "A problem that threatens our entire operation." She leaned forward. "A problem that even my," Nabiki paused. "Friends." She said after a moment. "In the police department will not be able to overlook." Nabiki leaned back and sipped her drink. "I've worked too hard building this organization to let some sick fool tear it apart." Somehow the very coldness of her delivery made the simple statement menacing.</p><p>Kyoshi gulped his drink down. In the two plus years he had been with Nabiki he has seen her in many moods. But this was a side of Nabiki he had never seen before. Kyoshi could feel the sweat start beading on his forehead. 'And I'm not the one she's mad at.' He thought in a concern that bordered on fear. "Wh-who?" Kyoshi stopped. "Tokio." He said suddenly. Nabiki nodded. "What did he do?" Kyoshi's voice was calm now that he understood the recipient of Nabiki's anger.</p><p>"What he did and what he continues to do." She raised her hand and Kimi slapped a folder into her palm. She handed the folder to Kyoshi. "It appears our Mr. Wasuhara has been less than forthcoming about some of his operations." Nabiki began as Kyoshi started flipping through the folder. "As you know I have no real objection to prostitution." She began. "Within certain boundaries." She said. "Tokio has exceeded those boundries." She nodded toward the folder. "What you're holding represents the combined efforts of Kimi and a number of other resources." She turned her head. "Kimi?"</p><p>"Over the past eight months, Tokio has smuggled, into Japan, at least a dozen teenaged girls from Tibet and China." Kimi snorted. "And when I say teenaged, I mean the oldest was fifteen." Her voice became a growl. "The girls are bought from very poor families," Kimi took a breath. "Drugged until they're docile. And put to work in brothels." Kimi jerked a chin at the folders. "Those are the ones I''ve located." She said. "They're spread around a half dozen brothels. Wasuhara's brothels."</p><p>"Tokio?" Kyoshi said in disbelief. "I know he's a pig but..." Kyoshi shook his head in denial. "Not even Tokio would stoop so low." He said. "You know the kind of women he likes."</p><p>"Apparently he's expanded his taste." Kimi replied.</p><p>"I can forgive a lot of things." Nabiki said in her coldest voice. "But not this."</p><p>"You're going to," Kyoshi stopped. "It'll mean a war." He predicted. "Tokio's organization is the largest single group in our association." Kyoshi stood and walked over to the bar and made himself another drink. "And he wont go down without a fight."</p><p>"No. He won't." Agreed Nabiki. She gazed at the Yakuza lord over the rim of her glass. "The question is; who will you back?" She raised a hand. "before you answer, understand one thing, whether you join me, join Tokio or sit it out altogether, this will not go unanswered." Nabiki sat up and leaned forward. "If Tokio, or anyone, thinks otherwise, they are gravely mistaken."</p><p>Kyoshi stared into the cold eyes of Nabiki Tendo. Like a card player looking for a 'tell' he tried to read the expressionless face in front of him. Kyoshi found he was the one to break the unspoken test of wills. Kyoshi Nerumi was, as had been remarked, a man who understood when and how to be violent. Part of his control came from others knowing that he would, and could, be violent. Looking at Nabiki he instinctively recognized and understood the same thing about her. Kyoshi sipped his drink. "You know the answer to that, Ice Queen." Kyoshi said firmly. " Or you wouldn't have invited me here tonight." He grimaced slightly. "Tokio probably already knows I'm here." He said.</p><p>"Oh we're sure of it." Kimi replied. "We made sure."</p><p>Kyoshi looked at Kimi in surprise. His surprise changed to understanding. "You want him worried."</p><p>"We want him scared." Nabiki replied. "We want him to make a mistake."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"You wanted to see me, My Lady." Yuki asked.</p><p>"Ah Yuki." Kodachi replied. "I understand you and Makoto will be seeing Mr. Morimoto this weekend."</p><p>"Yes, My Lady." Yuki replied with a slight blush.</p><p>"Will you be going out of town?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>Yuki shook her head. "No." She replied. "Genji, I mean, Mr. Morimoto, has several meetings he must attend in Tokyo." Yuki sighed. "That man works as hard as the Ice Queen." She grumbled. "And he gets such terrible indigestion afterwards." She looked up at Kodachi's laugh. "My Lady?"</p><p>"You sound just like Makoto." Kodachi said. "Don't tell me you're falling for Genji Morimoto as well." She raised an eyebrow at Yuki's deepening blush. "I see." Kodachi said in surprise. "I thought he was Makoto's man."</p><p>"Genji is a very nice man. You can't help liking him." Yuki said defensively. "And he's Makoto's." She said firmly. "I'm, I'm just, just helping things along." She stammered. She turned her head to look at the snickering Noriko. "Well I am."</p><p>"I apologize, Yuki." Noriko said soothingly. "Sometimes it's difficult for an old whore to keep her mind out of the gutter." She said.</p><p>"Noriko." Kodachi said reprovingly. "You're not that old." She said in deadpan tones. She smiled when Noriko barked a laugh. She returned her attention to Yuki. "Some day you're going to have to tell us his secret." She said in a coaxing tone. Yuki looked at the floor. "Nevermind, that wasn't why I called you here." She picked up an envelope off her desk. "Since Mr. Morimoto has seen fit to request your presence, what is this the third, fourth time?"</p><p>"Fourth, My Lady." Yuki replied.</p><p>"Fourth." Agreed Kodachi. "Since it appears that you will be entertaining Mr. Morimoto on a somewhat regular basis, Noriko and I feel you should be suitably recompensed for your efforts." She extended the envelope with both her hands. "Unfortunately we never did negotiate what your services would be worth but Noriko convinced me that, since you're as exclusive as Makoto, you should receive a similar amount."</p><p>"My Lady," Yuki stopped. "Ms. Mata flatters me, but there's only one Makoto." She said with a slight smile. "And it's unnecessary, my salary as a Kuno retainer."</p><p>"Doesn't cover this." Kodachi said firmly. She waggled the envelope. "We insist."</p><p>"Buy yourself something nice." Noriko urged.</p><p>Yuki hesitated for a long moment then, reluctantly, took the envelope. "Oh well, maybe I could put it in the bank of something." She said. "Thank you, My Lady."</p><p>Kodachi raised her veil. "Oh, that's another thing." She said. "I believe my girls call me; Ms. Kuno."</p><p>Yuki looked at Kodachi for a moment. Her hand went to the pendant around her neck. She straightened her already erect posture even more. "That's right, we do." She said. "Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Thank you, Yuki." Kodachi replied as she lowered her veil. "Enjoy your weekend."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Nodoka put down her book with a sigh as the limo came to a stop in front of the club. The door was opened by the driver. Nodoka nodded to him in thanks and walked toward the entrance of the club. As usual she was wearing a full kimono, this one was in somber shades of blue. The doorman bowed as Nodoka approached then opened the door and waved her in. The noise of the outer club was muted.</p><p>As the inner, more exclusive club had changed, so too had the outer club. Now more restaurant than bar it catered to those who desired an evening of elegance, style and more than a touch of mystery and danger. The food was superb, the service excellent but more people came because they knew who owned the club and the rumors surrounding her. Rumors that were enhanced by the looming presence of Abe at the entrance to the inner club. The private club was now even more private, even more exclusive. Everyone hoped for an invitation. An invitation that could be extended by Nodoka Saotome.</p><p>Nodoka's entrance into the outer club brought the background conversation to a virtual halt only to be replaced by a sudden buzz. As Nodoka walked toward the back of the restaurant more than one patron stood and bowed as she passed. Nodoka nodded regally to the various patrons and even stopped to chat with one couple at one table. By the expression on the young couple's faces, it appeared they had received such an invitation.</p><p>Nodoka finally reached the entrance to the inner club. "Good evening, Abe." Nodoka greeted the huge bouncer.</p><p>"Good evening, Auntie." Abe rumbled in greeting. The bouncer respectfully opened the door to the inner club and bowed Nodoka through. Nodoka was immediately met by a familiar young woman. "Good evening, Fumie." Nodoka said in greeting.</p><p>"Good evening, Auntie." Fumie replied. "It looks like it's going to be a quiet evening." She informed the older woman. She shook her head saidly. "They called again." She said in a quiet aside. "You're going to lose them if you don't see them soon." Fumie said in warning tones.</p><p>Nodoka sighed. "Maybe that would be for the best." She said. They reached Nodoka's private booth and Nodoka looked at it before she sat down. "Tea, Fumie." Nodoka sighed despondently. Fumie nodded and walked off. She relayed Nodoka's request to the bartender and went to see Miki.</p><p>"How's Auntie?" Miki asked.</p><p>"About as you'd expect." Fumie replied. "She's miserable." She said. "And she's not the only one." She looked back toward Nodoka's booth. "This has gone on long enough." She said suddenly. "If she won't call them, then I will."</p><p>"I'm surprised you've waited this long." Miki said in mild complaint. "It's been weeks." She said. "I'm surprised the boys haven't looked for someone else." Miki's voice held a questioning note. "They haven't, have they?" Her voice became worried.</p><p>"Believe it or not, no." Fumie replied with a touch of amusement. "Whatever she's got, they still want it." She said. "And it isn't the money." She raised her hand with just her thumb, index and middle fingers extended. "Three," She said. "Three women have already put in bids on the boys. Good bids. More than Auntie's paying. A lot more." She said. "They turned them down. They said they'd wait a little longer." Fumie pulled out her cell phone. She punched in a number. "She's here." She said without preamble. "We'll take care of everything, cousin, you just get down here and talk to Auntie." She hung up the phone. 'Who's in the suite?" She asked Miki.</p><p>"Aoi, I think." Miki replied. She tapped her lower lip in unconscious imitation of Kodachi as she checked an appointment book. "Oh good, Suki's not booked. I'll put her on retainer for tonight." She said decisively. "Just in case." She and Fumie exchanged knowing smiles. "The rest is up to the boys."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Nodoka sipped her tea and listened as Rei sang to the evening crowd. Since it was a weeknight, the crowd was smaller and Rei took the opportunity to work on some new songs. Mostly, it seemed to Nodoka, unrequited love songs. Nodoka sighed. She placed the tea down and leaned back against the seat. She sighed again and closed her eyes as Rei started singing yet another torch song. "it's for the best." She told herself softly. Her resolve didn't prevent a tear of regret to fall from one eye. "Silly old woman." She scolded herself. Nodoka's eyes opened with a start when she felt something touch her cheek. She found herself looking into a pair of very familiar eyes. "Jiro?" She gasped. Just behind him she saw another familiar face. "D-Daisuke?"</p><p>"Miss Nodoka." Daisuke and Jiro chorused quietly. Jiro gently wiped the tear from Nodoka's eye. "You shouldn't be crying." Jiro said in concern. "You're supposed to smile."</p><p>"You shouldn't be here." Nodoka choked out. Jiro's familiar touch on her face was destroying all her resolve. "You shouldn't, " she protested. "We can't." she said when Daisuke sat down on her other side. "Someone could..." Her protest was weak even to her own ears.</p><p>"Oh there you are." Came Fumie's voice.</p><p>Nodoka sighed in relief. "Oh Fumie. Thank the gods you're here." She said. "We, we..."</p><p>"You can't stay here." Fumie said. She waved her hands. "Come on, come on."</p><p>"What?" Nodoka said in confusion. She found herself being guided out of the booth and quickly found her arms looped through the arms of her two young men. "What?"</p><p>"Come on." Fumie said impatiently. She strode away and Nodoka found herself compelled to follow as Jiro and Daisuke almost carried her along as they walked after Fumie. They came to a door. She pressed a button and the door slid open. Nodoka found herself in an elevator and wedged tightly between Jiro and Daisuke. Closer than the smallness of the elevator accounted for.</p><p>"Where?" Nodoka asked in confusion. The nearness of her two former lovers, the feel of their bodies against hers, was causing rushes of emotional memory to cascade over Nodoka. Nodoka mewled in a mix of despair and delight as the two young men wrapped their arms around her. The car stopped and Nodoka was escorted out of the elevator and down a hallway. They stopped at a door and Fumie opened it with a key. She pushed the door open and waved the three in. "This way." Said Fumie. She led them to a back room. Fumie opened the door and waved the three into the room. Fumie grinned. "Later." She said and closed the door.</p><p>Nodoka looked at the closed door in shock and barely felt the two young men begin to undress her. It wasn't until Nodoka's Kimono fell to the floor that Nodoka realized what was going on. "We musn't.." Began Nodoka only to have her protests smothered when Jiro captured Nodoka's mouth with his own. Nodoka moaned.</p><p>She barely felt Daisuke remove the rest of her clothing but became all too aware when Daisuke pressed his body against hers and she realized he was naked. Daisuke's hands captured her breasts as, this time, Jiro pulled away. Nodoka lost herself in the rush of illicit pleasure as Daisuke kissed the back of her neck hungrily.</p><p>Nodoka felt a pair of warm hands spread her thighs and her back arched in ecstasy . "Ooh Jiro." Purred Nodoka. "That's my good boy." Her hand pressed against the back of Jiro's head. Her other hand reached behind her and searched for and quickly found what she sought. "My good, good boys."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Fumie sashayed out of the elevator with a smug look on her face and a rhythm in her walk. She saw Ami approaching. The blonde raised a hand and she and Fumie slapped palms as they met. "Auntie's settled in."</p><p>"Good." Ami replied. She looked around. "I saw Jokoto last night." She said conversationally.</p><p>"Oh?" Fumie asked. Jokoto was one of Tokio Wasuhara's men who frequented the club. In fact he was the only one of Tokio's men who frequented the club. "And how is Joe?" She asked. "He seemed a little down the last time I saw him."</p><p>"Pissed, actually." Ami replied. "He told me Tokio has been a real prick lately." She reported. She leaned closer. "Something big is going down and soon." She said in quiet tones.</p><p>"Oh good." Fumie replied in satisfaction. "I'll make sure Ms. Kuno knows."</p><p>End Chapter 1</p><p>Author's Notes: Basically a message to Amwood Co... I spent a long time trying to decide if was going to reply to your review or not. Dude, I love ya man, you've been a constant and friendly reviewer for a long time but...you really have got to keep up. The evolution of the eye, while complex, is not 'irreducibly complex'. It was an interesting and thought provoking puzzle and it provoked a lot of discussion and debate in the scientific community but in the end a plausible model of eye evolution was proposed. It is currently undergoing review. Which leads to a couple points. Just because someone finds a potential 'hole' in a theory that does not mean that a) the whole theory is incorrect and b) it does not make the competing theory, in this case Creationism, correct. It just means there is something the current theory cannot explain. For example, Newtonian physics is perfectly valid, up until a certain point. Einsteinian Physics is even better, up until a certain point, at which point quantum physics takes over. But the point is, all three Theories, and they are all theories, are still valid within the bounds of what it can be used for. The second point is that Science is a self correcting and constantly expanding discipline. But the basic doctrine applies which basically states; Nature has rules. These rules can be discerned and explained without requiring divine or magical intervention.</p><p>Creationism has its' own flaws, the primary one being that there's no evidence. No fingerprint, marker or signiture. And until Creationists, especially those at ICR, decide to actually research, publish and submit for peer review any of their theories, they will continue to be considered nothing more than con men. Harsh but true.</p><p>Now I'm not saying you're doing this but one of the main issues most 'evolutionists' have with Creationists is the characterization of 'evolutionists' as atheists or that Evolution itself is a religion. Contradictory positions that are often held at the same time. You must understand that it is very difficult to discuss a subject with someone who considers disagreement as a one way ticket to hell. I've communicated with many an evolutionist and I have found that, to the contrary, many were people of deep faith.</p><p>Another issue is the use of mischaracterization of Evolution itself as an argument. For example; conflating Cosmology with Evolution or Abiogenesis with Evolution or, as is most usual, conflating all three. Evolution is what happens to Life once life starts. Period. And don't get me started on Nebraska Man, Lady Hope, or the Paluxy River tracks. All hoaxes.</p><p>But the biggest issue science, not evolution science, has with Creationism is that it is an attack on rationalism and the scientific method. Why study anything if the answer is always going to be; God did it or Magic? God may have done it but he used the physical laws he/she/them/it set in place.</p><p>Peace</p>
