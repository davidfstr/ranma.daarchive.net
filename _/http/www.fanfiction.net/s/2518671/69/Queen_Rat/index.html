</div><p>Chapter 8</p><p>'Basics'</p><p>The weekend flew by for Kagomi. In the mornings and for most of the day, she and Pema watched over Kiko and her young friends. Most of the time they did little more than sit in the same room as the young girls and talk to each other. Other times, such as when a meal was served or at the pool, Kagomi and Pema had to chase and herd one wayward girl after another back to the group. Kagomi was under the constant worry that something priceless would be damaged or destroyed. Each evening she breathed a sigh of relief that no disaster had occurred. At night, and after Pema called Ranma, she and Pema would talk. Mostly about Ranma.</p><p>Kagomi would listen in fascination as Pema would describe some event or some aspect of her life with Ranma and , as Pema put it, his 'womans'. "You know, the more you talk about it, the more it sounds like Ranma is building a harem." Kagomi commented. "I mean, first Akane, then Ukyo and now you." She shook her head. "Don't any of you get jealous?"</p><p>Pema shook her head and giggled. "Well Ukyo say Akane used to gets very, very jealous." Pema admitted. "But Ukyo say that before Akane know in heart that Ranma love her best." Pema giggled again and leaned closer to Kagomi. "Ukyo also say, Ranma too much man for one woman, too much even for goddess like Akane." She said. "Need other womans so Akane not get worn out." She confided. "And it true." Pema said with a firm nod. "Pema know, Pema see." She gave Kagomi a wide eyed look. "Ranma big, big man."</p><p>Kagomi licked her lips. "Um, how big?" Kagomi's mouth dropped open when Pema spread her hands apart. "Oh come on, he can't be that big." Kagomi complained.</p><p>Pema looked at her hands. "Oh you right." She said. Pema spread her hands further apart. "That closer." Pema giggled.</p><p>"You're kidding." Kagomi said. Pema shook her head. "You're not kidding." Kagomi said. Pema nodded. "Whoa." Kagomi breathed. Kagomi looked down at her crotch. "It'd never fit." She muttered.</p><p>Pema giggled. "That what Pema say." She said.</p><p>"And...?" Kagomi prompted.</p><p>A slightly annoyed expression appeared on Pema's face. "Pema still not know." She said. "Ranma still think Pema too young." Pema's expression became happy again. "But Akane say Pema be old enough soon." She said proudly. "Even if hurt, Pema do best to make Ranma happy."</p><p>"Still sounds like a harem." Kagomi muttered. "I mean, what would you do if Ranma decided he wanted a fourth or fifth woman? Then what?"</p><p>"If that what Ranma want." Pema said seriously. "But it not up to Pema, Akane one who decide." She looked at Kagomi with a sly expression. "Why you ask? You want be Ranma woman?" She asked. She giggled when Kagomi blushed. "Pema not mind, Pema think Kagomi cute." She said. "Maybe Pema ask Akane, yes?"</p><p>"Yes, I mean no." Kagomi said hurriedly. She pouted when Pema's giggles redoubled. "Okay, okay, I think he's hot."</p><p>"Everyone think Ranma hot." Pema agreed cheerfully. "That because Ranma...hot." Pema smiled. "But..." Pema paused. "You think girl Ranma hot?" She asked.</p><p>"Well she's cute." Kagomi said slowly. She looked at Pema. "Oh, yeah, you said..." She broke off as Pema nodded. "Really?"</p><p>"Really." Pema said in confirmation.</p><p>"Whoa." Kagomi breathed again. "I don't know...I mean doing something you don't really like..." She trailed off as Pema started laughing. "You like it?"</p><p>"Pema like very much." Pema said. "Just like boy Ranma best." Pema giggled. "All Ranma womans like boy Ranma best." She explained cheerfully. "But being Ranma woman mean making Ranma happy when boy, when girl." Pema grinned. "Pema like very much making Ranma happy." Pema sighed. "Pema wish Ranma here now."</p><p>"Well we'll be going home tomorrow." Kagomi said, "Kind of sad the weekend's over." She grumped. Kagomi looked at Pema. "It's been fun." She said. "Thanks." Kagomi looked up as someone knocked on the door. Kagomi got up and opened the door. She stepped back. "Lady Kuno." She said and bowed. Pema scrambled to her feet and bowed along with Kagomi.</p><p>"May I come in?" Kodachi asked. Kodachi was dressed in her usual black, though this time it was black slacks and matching jacket. A half veil covered her eyes.</p><p>"Of course Lady Kuno." Kagomi replied.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno." Corrected Kodachi with a smile. "Lady Kuno would be Nabiki Tendo once she marries my brother." She said with a smile. "Which brings me to part of what I wanted to speak to the two of you about." She said. Kodachi walked over to one of the beds and sat down. Pema and Kagomi looked at each other than sat on the other bed. "First, I want to say I've been very impressed with the two of you."</p><p>"Thank you, Ms. Kuno." The two teenaged girls chorused in response.</p><p>Kodachi smiled. "No, thank you." She replied. "Kiko by herself is a handful, Kiko and her ten friends..." Kodachi laughed. "Honestly I don't know how you did it."</p><p>"Pema really deserves the credit." Kagomi said. "She's, well, they listen to her."</p><p>"So I noticed." Kodachi replied. "But don't dismiss your own contributions, Miss Akahito." Kodachi said. "You both deserve the credit." She reached into her jacket. "Speaking of which, I would like to give the two of you a small token of my appreciation." She removed two packages from her pocket and handed them to Pema and Kagomi. "Why don't you open them later." She suggested. "As I said, I was very impressed with the two of you and wondered if you'd both consider reprising your roles at my Brother's wedding?"</p><p>Kagomi nearly dropped the package she was holding. "Wedding?" She squeaked. She swallowed audibly. "You, you want me, I mean me and Pema...?" Kagomi looked down at her feet. "I can't." She said in a near whisper. "I-I have, I'm not..." Kagommi ground to a halt. "I'd just embarrass you."</p><p>Kodachi looked at the teen for a moment. Then her eyes widened in understanding. "I have no intention of being embarrassed or embarrassing you." Kodachi replied gently. "As a member of the wedding party, your dress would, of course, be provided."</p><p>Kagomi looked up at Kodachi. Her eyes shone. "Oh Ms. Kuno." She exclaimed. "Do you really mean that?"</p><p>"Well of course I do." Kodachi smiled. "I assume from your response that you are willing to attend?" She asked. Kagomi nodded almost frantically. "Excellent." Kodachi slapped her thighs and stood. "Noriko will be in touch." Kodachi smiled. "Good night, ladies."</p><p>Kagomi waited until Kodachi exited the bedroom and the door had closed before she screamed. "Omigod, I'm going to the wedding." She shrieked. "Omigod, omigod, omigod." Kagomi started panting in excitement. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly to calm herself. "Calm down, Kagomi." She scolded herself. "Omigod, omigod, omigod." She chattered again.</p><p>Pema giggled as Kagomi paced across the room. "Kagomi best sit down before she make hole in floor." Pema laughed. She sat back down on her futon. "Kagomi come here." She patted her futon. "We cuddle little bit before sleep."</p><p>"Sleep?" Kagomi exclaimed. "How do you expect me to sleep?" She asked. "I was just invited to the biggest event...omigod, omigod, omigod." Kagomi said.</p><p>Pema patted her futon again. "Kagomi come here." Pema repeated. "We cuddle, then sleep." She said firmly. "Kagomi not want big circles under eyes, yes?"</p><p>Kagomi walked over to Pema's futon and sat down. "I'm never going to get to sleep." She muttered. Kagomi remembered the the package in her hand. "Can I open this first?" She asked.</p><p>Pema looked at her own gift. She smiled. "We both open." She said. There was the sound of paper ripping. "It box." Pema said. Pema opened the velvet box. "Ooh, pretty."</p><p>"It's a charm bracelet." Kagomi said in excitement. "And look it even has charms already on it." She looked at the small charms dangling from the bracelet. "This must be Kiko." She decided upon looking at the charms. This charm was a female form. "And this..." She looked at one charm closely. "A spider?"</p><p>Pema nodded. "That mean you friend of Ms. Kuno." Pema said. "Remind Pema to ask Kiko to show you necklace." Pema said. Pema looked at the other charms. She nodded. "Little sword, little crown." Pema nodded again. "That Lord Kuno and Ice Queen." Pema closed the jewel box. "It very nice present."</p><p>"Nice?" Kagomi exclaimed. "It's better than nice, it's beautiful." Kagomi sighed. "Thanks Pema."</p><p>Pema tilted her head. "Why you thank Pema? Ms. Kuno give you present." She pointed out.</p><p>"I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you." Kagomi pointed out. She reluctantly closed the box and put it on the nightstand. "Thanks." She said again.</p><p>Pema patted the futon. "You want thank Pema, you come here, we cuddle." She said. "Okay?"</p><p>Kagomi smiled wryly. "Always trying to get me into your bed, aren't you?" She said in teasing tones.</p><p>"Of course." Pema replied. "Pema like Kagomi." Pema smiled at the other girl. "Now get in bed." She said with a touch of impatience in her voice. "We may not cuddle again for long time." She said.</p><p>Kagomi raised a finger. "Good point." She said. "Move over." Kagomi got into the bed with Pema. The Tibetan girl immediately leaned her head on Kagomi's shoulder. Pema threw an arm across Kagomi. "You know, I think I'm going to miss cuddling with you." Kagomi said a minute later. She snickered. "Even if you do molest me in your sleep." She turned her head to look at Pema. The Tibetan girl was looking back at her. "You did last night, you know." Kagomi said.</p><p>"Who Pema call you this time?" Pema asked with a smile. "Pema think.. Akane?"</p><p>Kagomi shook her head. "No." She replied. Kagomi licked her lips. "You said..." Kagaomi paused. "Kagomi." She said in a near whisper.</p><p>"Oh." Pema breathed. "Pema hope Kagomi not mad."</p><p>Kagomi shook her head. "No, not mad." She said. "Confused." She admitted. "Do you, I mean..." Kagomi blushed. "I don't know what I mean." Kagomi said. "Do you think of me...?" Kagomi blushed redder. "Do you, I mean, were you...oh heck...maybe I should shut up." She mumbled.</p><p>Pema giggled. "Kagomi so cute when she blush." She said. Pema placed a finger against Kagomi's lips. "Pema like Kagomi very much." Pema said. "And Pema know Kagomi like Pema very much too." The Tibetan girl said quietly.</p><p>"Yeah? How do you know that?" Kagomi asked.</p><p>"Pema know because Kagomi still want cuddle with Pema." Pema replied with a smile. "Even when Kagomi know Pema, what that word Kagomi use?"</p><p>"Molest?" Kagomi supplied.</p><p>Pema giggled. "Yes, even though Kagomi complain Pema molest Kagomi in sleep, Kagomi still want cuddle." Pema giggled again. "At least Pema said right name this time." Pema wiggled closer to Kagomi and her hand stroked Kagomi's cheek. "Pema think Kagomi think of Pema the way Pema think of Kagomi, yes?"</p><p>"I don't know." Kagomi whispered. "I thought I liked guys." She half complained. "But, when you...touch me." Kagomi sighed. "I don't know."</p><p>"Pema like guys." Pema replied. "Pema like Ranma, remember?" Pema's hand moved down and cupped Kagomi's breast. She could feel Kagomi shiver against her. "Kagomi can tell Pema stop." Pema gently squeezed Kagomi's breast. She smiled. "Kagomi not saying stop." She sang knowingly.</p><p>Kagomi blew out a breath. "No, I'm not." She admitted.</p><p>"Feel nice?" Pema asked. Kagomi nodded. Pema giggled. "You want Pema show Kagomi...basics?"</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Noriko Mata was sprawled out on a settee in one of the many small offices in the Kuno mansion. She idly tapped some notes on her laptap. She looked up a sound. She turned her head to look at Kodachi Kuno who was writing some notes on some obscure botanical project she was currently working on. The sound came from Kodachi. The woman was humming to herself. Noriko smiled at the sound. 'Someone's feeling good.' Noriko thought in satisfaction. Noriko nodded to herself and returned to her notes.</p><p>Noriko continued working for another ten or fifteen minutes before her concentration was again interrupted this time by a knock on the door. "Yes?" She called.</p><p>"It's Yoshi, Ms. Mata." Yoshi announced himself through the door. "Miss Ami and Miss Miki have returned.'</p><p>Noriko suppressed a giggle. 'Miss Ami and Miss Miki.' She thought. 'Only a Kuno would ever announce any of the girls like that.' She looked over to Kodachi. Kodachi was sitting back in her chair with an interested look on her face. "Send them in, Yoshi." Noriko called. The door opened and Yoshi ushered the two women into the room. "Thank you, Yoshi." Noriko said. Yoshi nodded and exited, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Noriko closed her laptop and sat up. "Ladies." Noriko greeted the two women. "Drink?"</p><p>"I'll make them." Miki said. "You're always too heavy on the vermouth." Miki said as she walked over to a small bar. "Your usuals?"</p><p>"I'm good." Kodachi said. "You're back sooner than we expected." Kodachi said. "Nothing wrong, I trust."</p><p>"Nah." Ami replied. "Kyoshi had some work to attend to." She said. "Don't worry, he was suitably rewarded for his recent efforts." Ami said in Nodoka like tones. She giggled. "Boy couldn't stop talking about being given two of Kodachi's top girls as a reward." Ami sat down in a chair opposite Kodachi. She accepted a drink from Miki and took a sip before she said anything. "He's loyal." She said finally.</p><p>"Kyoshi realizes who's buttering his bread and he's fine with it." Miki added.</p><p>"More than fine." Ami said. "The man is bright enough to have figured out most of Ice Queen's plans." Ami smiled wryly. "Well as much as anyone could figure out any of her plans."</p><p>"Lady Kuno is never to be underestimated." Kodachi agreed. "Or the Lady Kimi." Kodachi looked down for a moment. "As I should know." Kodachi leaned back in her chair. "What does he know?" Kodachi asked. "Or thinks he knows"</p><p>"He's already figured out that the Ice Queen has converted the majority of her holdings into a single, legal entity. Though he believes it's only a cover." Ami reported. "He's realized that most of the prostitution, the street walking kind, is being confined to smaller and smaller areas. In response he's converted most of his prostitution activity to emulate what you, Ms. Kuno, have implemented." She smiled almost proudly. "There are several new gentlemens clubs in his territory."</p><p>"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery," Kodachi murmurred. "And in this case, a welcome imitation." She said. "Go on."</p><p>"Kyoshi has pretty much figured out, though he hasn't figured out how, that the Ice Queen is somehow laundering everything Oyabun Honda is bringing into Tokyo. He suspects Genji Morimoto is somehow involved but considers Genji a harmless dupe." Ami said crisply. She looked at Kodachi with a curious expression. "Is he?"</p><p>Kodachi smiled. "It's a mistake to consider any of Lady Kuno's inner circle as harmless. Including Genji." She said in response. "what else?"</p><p>"That's about it, other than the fact that Kyoshi wants to know if we're available next weekend." Ami grinned a chipmunk grin. "Are we?"</p><p>"Tell him, maybe." Kodachi replied in amusement. "You were a reward, after all." She shook her head. "How do you do it, Ami?"</p><p>"It's a joy to behold, Ms. Kuno." Miki piped up. "Ami had him eating out of her hand."</p><p>"Sounds kinky," Noriko said with a laugh. "Good work ladies." She said.</p><p>"Agreed." Kodachi said. "Good work."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The limo stopped in front of an apartment building in a fashionable part of Itabashi. A liveried retainer stepped out of the passenger side of the front and opened the rear passenger door. "You're home, Miss Tenzin."</p><p>Pema stepped out of the limo, followed by Kagomi. "You wait little while?" She asked the retainer. "Pema want Kagomi say hello." She nodded toward the apartment building.</p><p>The retainer smiled. "We'll stay as long as you want." He said. The retainer looked right and left and then leaned toward Pema. "Do you think you could...?' He pulled a book out of his pocket. "I'd really like U.S.A.'s autograph." He said.</p><p>Pema giggled. "Pema think she can do that." She took the book from the retainer and grabbed her suitcase. "Let's go, Kagomi." Pema hurried toward the front door with Kagomi in tow. A quick trip up the elevator and Pema was opening the door to the apartment. "Pema home." She called.</p><p>Ranma hurried out of the kitchen. Kagomi suppressed a giggle to see the tall and muscular Ranma Saotome wearing a frilly apron. "Pema." Ranma grabbed Pema in a bear hug and swung her, giggling, around. Pema's giggles changed to happy sighs when Ranma kissed her warmly. "welcome home, baby." Ranma said quietly. "We missed you."</p><p>"Pema miss everyones too." Pema replied. She looked up at Ranma. "Where Akane, where Ukyo?" She asked.</p><p>"Went to get a few things." Ranma replied. "They'll be back soon."</p><p>Pema rested her head against Ranma's broad chest for a moment then pushed away. She took Ranma's hand and led him to the door, where Kagomi was standing open mouthed. "Ranma remember Kagomi?"</p><p>"Sure I do." Ranma replied. "Hey." He said in greeting. He grinned as the teenaged girl blushed. "Come on in." He said.</p><p>"I-I don't want to, to impose." Kagomi began.</p><p>Pema made as tsking sound. "Kagomi not impose, Kagomi, Pema friend." She said. Pema looked up at Ranma. "Kagomi big, big help to Pema." She informed the martial artist. Pema looked down at her feet. "Pema miss Ranma but Kagomi keep Pema from beings too lonely."</p><p>"We're home." Came Akane's voice. She swung in through the window carrying a bag. Ukyo, carrying another bag, swung in right after. "Pema!" Akane exclaimed. Her exclamation was echoed by Ukyo. For the second and then third time, Pema found herself being swung around the room. Both Akane and Ukyo kissed the Tibetan girl soundly.</p><p>Ranma laughed. He looked down at Kagomi. "You in a hurry?" He asked.</p><p>Kagomi licked her lips. "Well the limo..." Began Kagomi.</p><p>"That can wait." Interrupted Ranma. "Call your grandfather." Ranma ordered. "And tell him you'll be late." Ranma said. "You're having dinner with us."</p><p>"But.." Kagomi began.</p><p>"But, what?" Ranma asked. "You in that much of a hurry to get away from Pema?" He asked lightly. Ranma's smile widened at Kagomi's blush. "Thought not." He said. "Call your grandfather." Ranma returned his attention to Pema. "Pema." He called. "Kagomi's staying for dinner." He smiled when Pema clapped her hands together happily.</p><p>Pema reached into her pocket. "Pema almost forgot." She handed the book to Ranma. "Man in limo want USA au-automo-auto, Kagomi what word?"</p><p>"Autograph, Pema." Kagomi replied.</p><p>"Yes, that." Pema said.</p><p>"Sure punkin." Ranma replied. He took the book. "Guy, huh?" He asked Pema. Pema nodded. Ranma scribbled something in the book then handed it to Akane. Akane read what Ranma wrote, giggled and then signed it herself. She handed the book to Ukyo. Ukyo signed it and gave it back to Ranma. "Be right back." Ranma said. Ranma dove headfirst out of the window.</p><p>"Eep." Kagomi squeaked. "He..he just..."</p><p>"It alright, Kagomi." Pema said reassuringly. "Ranma fine." Pema walked over and wrapped an arm around Kagomi's waist. "Pema so glad Kagomi not go home yet."</p><p>Ukyo looked at Akane. "Looks like baby has a friend." She commented quietly. "A good friend."</p><p>"Ya'think?" Akane asked. Ukyo nodded. Akane tapped a manicured finger against her lips. She shrugged. "We'll deal." She said. Ukyo pursed her lips, then nodded in agreement.</p><p>Ranma returned a few minutes later. He had Kagomi's suitcase in his hand. "I told the driver to head home." He said. "Old man Akahito doesn't live that far away." He looked around. "Where's Pema and Kagomi?" He asked.</p><p>"In Pema's room." Akane said. "Um, Ranma, Uk-chan thinks..." Akane and Ukyo exchanged looks. "We think Pema and Kagomi." Akane began.</p><p>"It's okay, Tomboy, I kind of figured that." Ranma smiled. "I think Pema was about to tell me, when you guys showed." He shrugged. "You guys okay with it?"</p><p>"I guess." Ukyo replied. She barked a laugh. "I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I think I was getting jealous."</p><p>"Again?" Akane rolled her eyes. "I'm supposed to be the unreasoning, jealous one." Akane said. She poked Ukyo in the chest. "You're supposed to be the warm, accepting one, remember?" Akane smiled at Ukyo. "So Pema has a girl friend, she needs someone her age around." Akane pointed out. "Right?" Ukyo nodded. "Good." Akane said. "Now, how about you get in the kitchen and rattle some pots and pans?" Akane said. Ukyo laughed. "I'll set the table." Akane said. "And Ranma will go check on the girls." She turned to Ranma and waved a finger. "Just check on them, don't try seducing Kagomi." She said in a teasing voice. "not without us, anyway."</p><p>"Spoilsport." Ranma replied. He laughed. "Okay Tomboy." He said. "Call us when dinner's ready." Ranma walked to Pema's bedroom door and knocked. "It's me." He said. The door opened quickly. "Can I come in?" He asked.</p><p>"Ranma know he not need ask." Pema replied. She took Ranma's hand and led him into the bedroom. Kagomi was sitting on the bed with a guilty look on her face. Pema had Ranma sit on the bed then sat down so she and Kagomi flanked him. She leaned against Ranma and sighed happily when Ranma put an arm around her. Ranma snuck a quick glance at Kagomi and suppressed a chuckle at the look of jealousy that appeared on the teen's face.</p><p>"Did you call your grandfather?" Ranma asked Kagomi. Kagomi nodded. "And?"</p><p>"Gramps said it was okay." Kagomi said quietly.</p><p>"Great." Ranma replied. "Looks like we're gonna start seein' a lot of you, Kagomi." Ranma said casually. "I suppose you'll be sleeping over every so often too."</p><p>"Oh, can Kagomi really sleep over, Ranma?" Pema asked excitedly.</p><p>"If you want, baby." Ranma replied. "You know we want you to be happy."</p><p>'Pema very happy." Pema declared. "Ranma?"</p><p>"Yeah, baby?" Ranma replied in gentle tones.</p><p>"Pema need tell Ranma something." She said quietly. "Pema really, really like Kagomi." She began. "And Kagomi really, really like Pema." She said.</p><p>Ranma looked at Kagomi. The teen was blushing redly. Ranma put his free arm around Kagomi's shoulders. Kagomi looked at Ranma in surprise. "Go on." Ranma said.</p><p>Pema looked at Kagomi. She smiled happily when she saw Ranma put his arm around the other teen. "Kagomi and Pema..." Pema paused. "Kagomi and Pema cuddle and..."</p><p>"Pema!" Kagomi exclaimed. "You're not going to tell him that?"</p><p>"Pema must, Kagomi." Pema replied.</p><p>"But Pema..." Kagomi wailed.</p><p>"But Kagomi..." Pema responded.</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "Now, now girls, let's not fight." Ranma squeezed both girls. "Pema is just doing what she's supposed to, Kagomi." Ranma said. "But you're embarrassing Kagomi, Pema." Ranma scolded. "Now, the girls and I think it's fine that you have a girlfiriend, Pema, but you have to be a little more discreet until Kagomi gets used to how things work around here."</p><p>Pema looked down. "Pema sorry Ranma." Pema said. "Pema sorry Kagomi." Pema's voice was contrite.</p><p>"It's okay, baby." Ranma replied. "Right Kagomi?" Ranma squeezed the girl's shoulder.</p><p>"But Mr. Saotome." Kagomi began.</p><p>"Ranma." Ranma corrected. He grinned. "Or Usagi, or Ranko, depending." Ranma gave Kagomi an amused look. "Though, I'd prefer you call me Usagi when your grandfrather is around. I don't want to confuse the old man too much."</p><p>Kagomi couldn't help but giggle. "You guys are so weird." She said."Is Pema going to tell you everything we do?" She asked plaintively.</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Just enough so we know no one is getting hurt." Ranma said. "Look Kagomi, Pema, well our relationship with Pema is complicated, you understand?" He said. "But we really care about her and want her to be happy."</p><p>"Do you love her?" Kagomi asked.</p><p>Ranma nodded slowly. "Yeah, we do." Ranma said simply. "So, we cool?" Ranma squeezed the two girls.</p><p>Kagomi nodded."Yeah, we're cool." She replied. Without her quite realizing it, Kagomi found her head against Ranma's broad chest. She sighed contentedly. Her sighs were echoed by Pema. It didn't enter Kagomi's mind to question being held by Ranma. She was enjoying the sensation too much to really care. 'I feel so safe.' She thought. 'Just like Pema said.' Kagomi closed her eyes.</p><p>"Dinner." Came Akane's voice through the door.</p><p>Kagomi opened her eyes with a start and, realizing what she was doing, pulled away from Ranma. "Excuse me." She said hurriedly.</p><p>"Aww." Complained Ranma. "I kinda liked it." He flashed Kagomi a warm smile. "Come on guys." Ranma said. "Let's see what Uk-chan's got for us tonight." He said.</p><p>"Wait you taste Ukyo food." Pema agreed enthusiastically. "Kagomi never want eat anywhere else." Pema grabbed Kagomi's hand and nearly dragged the girl out of the bedroom. Ranma followed at a slower pace.</p><p>By the time Ranma made it to the dining area, Kagomi and Pema were already sitting at the table and chatting was opening a bottle of unfiltered sake and Ukyo was placing the last platter on the table. "Smells good, Uk-chan." Ranma said appreciatively. Ranma sat down and was immediately joined by Akane and Ukyo. "Sake, Kagomi?" Ranma asked. The teen nodded and Ranma poured a glass.</p><p>"That's a lot of Sake." Kagomi commented. "Aren't you supposed to put it in little cups or something?" She took an experimental sip. "Hey. It's cold." She exclaimed. Kagomi took another sip. "Good though."</p><p>Ranma smiiled in response. Soon the group were busy eating. Pema began recounting the events of the weekend. "...and then Kagomi and I spent rest of evening getting little girls down from chandelier." Pema giggled. Her giggle was joined by Kagomi's.</p><p>"You should have seen Kiko." Kagomi said. "She shimmied up the chain like, like I don't know, like a monkey or something." She said. "I thought sure Ms. Kuno was going to yell at Kiko but then..."</p><p>"Ms. Kuno climb up chain after her." Pema interrupted. "And then two of them stick tongues at us." Pema and Kagomi giggled. Pema sighed. "It very happy time." She said.</p><p>"Sounds it." Ukyo commented. "So, Kodachi has adopted Kiko." She said in approving tones. "Good for her." She said. "Good for both of them." She added. "More sake?" She asked the teens. "Pema?" Pema nodded. "Kagomi?"</p><p>Kagomi nodded. "Everything tastes so good." She said. "Better than I expected." Kagomi giggled. "I mean, when I first saw you guys, I thought, I mean, you guys dress like, like, I don't know..."</p><p>"Strippers?" Akane guessed in amusement. "That's cause we are."</p><p>"Huh?" Kagomi said in confusion. "I thought that was an act...you know, like secret identities or something." She said. "You mean, you really...really?"</p><p>Ukyo and Akane laughed. "Really." Akane said. ""Damn good ones, if we say so ourselves."</p><p>"The best." Ukyo added. "Especially Ran-chan." Suddenly Ukyo laughed. "Hey Ran-chan, how about giving the girls a demonstration?"</p><p>"Well..." Ranma hesitated.</p><p>"Oh please, Ranma." Pema begged. "Pema never see." She turned to Kagomi. "Ranma tell me all about, but Pema too young to go to Kabuki." Pema said with a pout. "Please Ranma." She begged again.</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "Oh, all right." He said. Ranma tapped his lips with his fingers. "Hmm. Steak or sushi?"</p><p>"Steak." Akane and Ukyo chorused.</p><p>"Steak or sushi?" Kagomo asked Pema.</p><p>"Boy or girl." Pema replied. "Boy, steak. Girl, sushi." Pema giggled. "Pema think she want see boy Ranma dance." She said. "What Kagomi think?"</p><p>Kagomi looked at Ranma's powerful physique. She licked her lips. "Steak?" She squeaked.</p><p>"You heard the girls, Ranma." Akane said gleefully. "Ladies night." She announced. "Uk-chan, you grab the Sake." Akane led the giggling teens into the living room. "Sit." She told the teens. The two girls sat and were immediately flanked by Ukyo and Akane. Akane sat next to Kagomi and Ukyo, much to Ukyo's delight, sat next to Pema.</p><p>Ranma, in the meantime, had disappeared into the bedroom. He returned several minutes later dressed in swordsman's outfit. Though it was doubtful that any swordsman, Tatewaki Kuno included, would have worn one that was covered in red sequins. Ranma grabbed a remote and pressed a button. Music began to play, a slow, sensual rhythm. Ranma turned his back on the fiour women and started moving his hips in time to the music.</p><p>Even covered by the fabric of the costume, Ranma's movements captured the eyes of the women, Kagomi and Pema especially. As it was a strip tease, Kagomi and Pema squealed excitedly every time some part of Ranma's costume hit the floor. They sighed when Ranma's shirt came off, revealing his broad, muscular chest. And Kagomi's gulp was audible over the music when Ranma removed the loose pants, revealing his briefs covered bottom. Kagomi's mouth dropped open when Ranma turned around.</p><p>"Careful Kagomi." Akane whispered into the teen's ear. "Ranma considers an open mouth an invitation." She giggled when Kagomi's mouth closed with a click. "Spoilsport." Akane said.</p><p>"Akane." Complained Kagomi with a blush. Kagomi took a large swallow of her Sake. A moment later her mouth dropped open again. "Oh, gods, he's gorgeous." She said in awe. Her eye's widened as Ranma turned around to face away from Kagomi and slowly removed his briefs. "Turn aournd." She found herself whispering, almost praying. "Please turn...oh my gods." Her mouth dropped open again. Ranma wasn't naked, his sex was covered by a tassled and sequined, fabric sheath. "Tell me there's a sock in there." She squeaked.</p><p>"Oh no, Kagomi, that all Ranma." Pema said proudly. She clapped her hands together happily. "More." She demanded. "Akane, what they say at club?"</p><p>"Take it off?" Akane asked in amusement.</p><p>"Yes, that." Pema agreed. "Take it off." Pema said in excitement. "Show Kagomi. Show Kagomi." She turned to the other teen. "Kagomi want see, yes?" She demanded more than asked. "Say yes, Kagomi, say yes." Pema pleaded.</p><p>"You mean, he'll really...I'll see...really?" Kagomi asked. She looked at Akane. The older woman nodded. "Yes?" She said while looking at Akane.</p><p>"Good girl." Said Akane in approval. Akane reached out with a hand and turned Kagomi's head to face Ranma. "And since you're such a good girl, Ranma will let you do the honors." As Akane spoke Ranma walked over to stand just in front of the teen. "Go ahead." Akane urged.</p><p>Almost mesmerized Kagomi slowly reached up to take a hold of the sides of Ranma's g-string. With a deep breath Kagomi pulled the fabric down. "Oh. My. Gods." Kagomi breathed in awe.</p><p>"I love it when they say that." Ranma commented. He grinned at the twin chorus of 'slut', from Akane and Ukyo. "You bet." He agreed. "Ah, ah." He said in caution as Kagomi's hand reached for him. "No touching without permission." He chastised in an amused voice.</p><p>Pema looked over her shoulder at Ukyo. "Can Kagomi ask?" She asked Ukyo. Ukyo nodded. Pema smiled happily. "Oh thank you." She turned back to Kagomi. "Kagomi." Pema said excitedly. "Say what Pema say." Pema said. Kagomi nodded without taking her eyes off of Ranma's sex. "Kagomi say; Ranma."</p><p>"Ranma." Breathed Kagomi.</p><p>"Can I." Prompted Pema.</p><p>"Can I." Kagomi swallowed.</p><p>"Suck." Pema said.</p><p>"Suck." Kagomi said</p><p>"Your cock." Pema urged. "Say it Kagomi."</p><p>Kagomi swallowed again and then looked up at Ranma. "Can I suck your cock?" She whimpered to a chorus of 'good girl' from Akane and Ukyo. "Please." She begged.</p><p>"Pema too, Ranma." Pema said. "Pema show Kagomi how Ranma like."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma, in female form, dropped down in front of a storefront with Kagomi in her arms. The lights were off but Kagomi walked over to a door just next to the store's main door and unlocked it. She opened it and she and Ranma walked in. "Gramps, I'm home." She called.</p><p>"Kagomi." The old man's waspy voice came from another room. "Do you have any idea..." The old man began when he came into the main room. "Oh." The old man stopped when he saw Ranma, in female form and in full Usagi mode. Which meant she was wearing very short red shorts and a tube top that barely contained her large breasts.</p><p>"Hi, Mr. Akahito." Ranma said in her sexiest contralto. "I'm so sorry I brought Kagomi home so late." She shimmied over to the old man. "It's all my fault." She said in apology. "I hope you will forgive me."</p><p>"S-sure, Usagi." The old man said.</p><p>"Oh, Kagomi said you would understand." Ranma/Usagi exclaimed. She pulled the old man into an embrace and between her breasts. "You're so sweet." She cooed then placed a kiss on top of the old man's head. She gently pushed the old man away from her breasts. "You're going to be seeing a lot of us, sweetie." Ranma cooed. "Because Big Daddy has taken a personal interest in Kagomi." Ranma said with a smile. "Understand?" The old man nodded rapidly. "Good." Said Ranma. Ranma turned back to Kagomi. "See you next Friday, Kagomi." With a wave, Ranma walked out of the small apartment and took to the rooftops.</p><p>Kagomi sighed. "I'm going to bed." She announced. 'Alone.' She thought regretfully. "Oh, I almost forgot." She opened her suitcase and removed a large envelope. "A present from the girls." She held out the envelope. Kagomi suppressed a laugh when her grandfather reached eagerly for it. "Night gramps."</p><p>Old man Akahito opened the envelope and, with trembling hands, took out the first of the photos. It was a full frontal nude of Usagi. The old man licked his lips in anticipation and headed to his own room.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Pema knocked on the bedroom door. "It Pema." She heard Akane's voice telling her to come in. Pema opened the door. Akane and Ukyo were sitting up on the bed. Pema walked to the foot of the bed. "Pema want thank Akane and Ukyo." She said. "Pema love Ranma, love Akane, love Ukyo but..." Pema hesitated.</p><p>"It's alright sugar, we understand." Ukyo said. She patted the bed invitingly. Pema almost jumped on to the bed. "We should have realized you needed a girlfriend." She said. "Relax sugar, we like her."</p><p>"Duh." Added Akane with a smile. "Of course we are a teensy bit mad at you for not asking first."</p><p>"Sorry Akane." Pema said contritely.</p><p>"It's okay, baby." Akane replied. "We can see why you like her." She said. "Not to mention she's a lot of fun." She tapped Pema on the nose with a finger. "Though she's not as...talented as you." She smiled when Pema giggled. "She's really going to have to practice more." Akane said. Pema giggled again. "You got Ukyo all jealous, you know." Akane commented.</p><p>"Oh noes." Pema exclaimed. She turned to Ukyo. "Please Ukyo, no be jealous." She begged. "Pema never want Ukyo, never want anyone, be unhappy." Pema threw herself into Ukyo's arms. "Ukyo tell Pema what she need do." Pema begged urgently. "Pema do anything Ukyo want."</p><p>"Now that's an offer I'd be crazy to refuse." Ukyo said. "And I ain't crazy." Ukyo kissed Pema on the nose. "Relax sugar, I'm not jealous." She said. "Not any more." Ukyo smiled. "But if you really want to make it up to me..." Ukyo laughed as Pema started nodding vigorously. "You mean you're not all tired out from before?" She asked teasingly. Pema shook her head. "Well, in that case..."</p><p>Ranma entered the apartment from the window as usual. The redhead went to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and found Akane sitting there. "Hey Tomboy." Ranma greeted the dark haired girl. "I thought you'd be asleep by now."</p><p>Akane giggled. "I should be, but Pema is busy apologizing to Ukyo." Ranma joined Akane in laughing. "Looks like we're exiled to the couch tonight." Akane added.</p><p>"Really?" Ranma said in interested tones. "Be right back." Ranma left the kitchen and returned several minutes later in male form. "Figured since it's just the two of us..." Ranma grinned. "Unless you want me to change back."</p><p>"Don't you dare." Akane mock growled. "I am not in the mood for toys." She said. "I want the real thing and , baby, there ain't no substitute for what you got." Akane strode over to Ranma. "Now are you gonna give me what I need or am I gonna have to take it?"</p><p>Ranma grabbed Akane and pulled her into his arms. "You know I love it when you talk tough, Tomboy." Ranma said huskily. "Pema and Uk-chan are fun but you're still my number one girl."</p><p>"Good." Akane replied. "Now stop talking and start fucking."</p><p>End Chapter 9</p><p>End Part 1</p><p>Author's Notes: As I said in my last AN, Ranma really is a pimp. Oh he may not have Akane or Ukyo turning tricks but there is only a fine line separating what they do with true prostitution. A lap dance is sex even when at least one of the participants is still fully dressed. So Ranma, along with Akane and Ukyo, are 'sex workers' and sex workers usually have pimps. As I illustrated in a previous chapter, Ranma calls himself 'Big Daddy' at least when the phone rings. Ranma also, as mentioned in an earlier chapter, strips in male form as well so nothing in this chapter should be that surprising. Pimps are always on the look out for new 'talent'.</p>
