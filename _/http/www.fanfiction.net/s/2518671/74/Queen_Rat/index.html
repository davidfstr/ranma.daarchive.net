</div><p>Wedding Belles</p><p>Kodachi was at her desk going through a few last minute details for the wedding when there was a knock on her office door. "Yes?" The door opened and Noriko walked in. "Oh Noriko."</p><p>"Sorry to interrupt, Ms. Kuno." Kodachi's aide and friend said. "But you have a guest." She said with a wide smile. Noriko stepped aside and a very familiar looking woman walked in.</p><p>"Konatsu!" Kodachi exclaimed in delight. "Where have you been?" She demanded. "I haven't seen you for..." Kodachi stopped and looked at the Kunoichi in surprise. The transvestite martial artist seemed the same but something was different. It took a moment before Kodachi realized what had changed. "Konatsu, you didn't..." She said in amazement.</p><p>"Do you like them?" Konatsu asked coyly. The transvestite turned in profile. For the first time in as long as Kodachi had known the transvestite, Konatsu's profile contained something it had not had before. Breasts. "Ryoga paid for them." Konatsu raised hands to the breasts she now apparenty had. "Of course, now I have to find a new place to hide the pepper bombs, but it's worth it." The transvestite smiled widely. "Now give me a kiss hello." Konatsu said. She and Kodachi embraced and exchanged kisses on the cheek.</p><p>Konatsu held Kodachi at arms length and looked at the woman closely. Finally Konatsu nodded in some satisfaction. "You're looking better." Konatsu released Kodachi, walked over to a couch and sprawled seemingly bonelessly on it. She raised a hand as Noriko walked over with a glass. Konatsu smiffed the glass. "Armagnac. You remembered." The transvestite said in appreciation. "Thanks, Noriko." Konatsu took a sip.</p><p>"You should know better than to expect Noriko to forget someone's favorite drink." Kodachi said in slightly reproving tones. "Move your feet." She demanded of the transvestite. Konatsu complied and Kodachi sat down. "Besides the breasts, how are you?" She asked. "It's been months." She said in slightly hurt tones.</p><p>"Sorry girlfriend." Konatsu said in contrite tones. "I got kind of sidetracked." He said. "Well, first I had to find a doctor willing to do the operation." He said. "You really should check out Brazil." The transvestite said. "I met some...girls there ... that made me look like I wasn't even trying." Konatsu shook his head. "I had to keep Ryoga on a very short leash."</p><p>"Sounds kinky." Noriko supplied.</p><p>"Noriko, hush." Kodachi said. "That's not what Konatsu meant." Kodachi paused. "I think." Kodachi laughed. "We are talking about Ryoga Hibiki, after all." She waved a hand. "Go on, you found a doctor..."</p><p>Konatsu took a sip of his drink. "I found a doctor." Konatsu raised a finger. "No. I found an artist." He said. "There's hardly a scar." He said cheerfully. "Well anyway, I found a doctor to do the operation, then there was a couple weeks to recover." Konatsu pouted. "You don't know how horny I was." he said. "Or how horny Ryoga was." He said. "Which is why it took so long to get back here." Konatsu smiled demurely. "Once the swelling went down." Konatsu chuckled. "The swelling went up."</p><p>"Konatsu." Scolded Kodachi. "You're incorrigible." She said. "I take it Ryoga was pleased with the results?"</p><p>"That's putting it mildly." Konatsu replied. "I didn't realize what a breast fixation the boy had." He rolled his eyes. "Not that I'm complaining you understand."</p><p>"And that other little issue that Ryoga has?" Kodachi asked. In response Konatsu's smile widened. "I see." She sighed. "Noriko please make a check out to Akane for two hundred thousand yen." She turned back to Konatsu. "I assume you have proof." She asked. Konatsu nodded cheerfully.</p><p>Noriko laughed. "That reminds me, we really should have a couple...boys...at the club."</p><p>"Really?" Purred Konatsu. "My, my girlfriend. Your clientelle certainly is...expanding." He said. "I may know of one or two who you might find acceptable." Konatsu tapped a manicured finger against lipsticked lips. "Maybe I should visit the club more often." He said. "Speaking of which, I need a loan."</p><p>"A loan?" Kodachi asked in surprise.</p><p>Konatsu nodded. "I want to buy the Orchid." He announced. "Or rather, buy into the Orchid." Konatsu clarified. "One of the original partners is getting out of the business and I thought..."</p><p>"I'll want to see the books." Kodachi said firmly. "I assume you'll be the manager?" Kodachi asked. Konatsu nodded. "Set up a meeting."</p><p>"Of course, Dachi." Konatsu sat up. "Well, I know you're busy with the wedding next week and all."</p><p>"You will be there, won't you?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"You just try keeping me away." Konatsu promised.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Good afternoon and welcome to an extended and very special Japan Tonight." The pretty reporter said into the camera. "I'm your host, Saatchi Kato." The reporter was wearing an elegant, formal gown in black and silver. Her hair had been expertly and stylishly done. A silver pendant hung around her neck. The camera panned back to show the reporter sitting on a high stool in the middle of what appeared to be an open sided held the microphone in one hand. The reporter smiled widely. "Well it's the day." She said simply as if everyone knew what day she was talking about. "But the big question is; will mother nature cooperate." She said. "For a weather update we go to our meterologist, Mitsui Oh. Mitsui?"</p><p>The image changed to show a pretty, though serious looking brunette with glasses, standing in front of a large video screen. The meteorologist had a smile on her face. "Thank you, Saatchi." The meteorologist replied. "Well it looks like even Mother Nature does what the Ice Queen wants." She said. A satellite image appeared on the screen behind her. "As you can see, clear skies." She said. "And with highs expected to reach the mid-seventies; I can't imagine a more perfect day for an outdoor wedding." The meteorologist said. "Back to you Saatchi." She said.</p><p>"Thanks Mitsui." The reporter said. "Well you heard her, a perfect day for the wedding of the year, probably the century " She said. "More, when we come back.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"You wanted to see me, Ms. Kuno?" Yuki, Kodachi's personal retainer, asked. Yuki was dressed in an irridescent and form fitting gold toned gown.</p><p>"Ah Yuki." Kodachi replied. Kodachi was wearing an elegent gown in black, a half veil covered her eyes. Kodachi gave her retainer's outfit a critical look. Finally she nodded. "Excellent choice of gown, Yuki." She said. "Don't you think so, Noriko?"</p><p>"You're looking hot, Yuki." Noriko agreed.</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." The retainer replied in pleased tones. "Thank you. Ms. Mata."</p><p>"Anyway, that wasn't why I called you here." Kodachi replied. "I understand that the Morimoto's have arrived..." Kodachi suppressed a smile as the retainer suddenly looked at the door of the library. "And I wondered if you would greet them for me." She said. "They've been given the red suite again." Kodachi did smile at the sudden and rapid nodding of Yuki's head. "Excellent." She replied. "Oh and Yuki."</p><p>"Yes, Ms. Kuno?" Yuki replied.</p><p>"The wedding is in two hours, try not to muss your gown." Kodachi said impishly. "You may go." Kodachi barked a laugh as her retainer all but ran out of the library. "One day we are going to get the secret out of them." Kodachi said musingly.</p><p>"One day." Agreed Noriko. "In the meantime, you are scheduled to be interviewed..." She looked at her watch. "In about fifteen minutes."</p><p>"Oh bother." Kodachi complained. "I have so much left to do."</p><p>"Relax, Dachi." Noriko said soothingly. "Everything's under control." She said. "Besides, we need the media, meaning Ms. Kato, to stay friendly." Noriko walked over and placed a hand on Kodachi's shoulder. "Now, be a good girl, and do your interview." Noriko ordered.</p><p>"Yes, Noriko." Grumped Kodachi. "I wish Kinnikun could have attended." She complained.</p><p>Noriko snorted. "That makes two of us." She said. "However, a little birdie told me that there have been some very, very interesting bids recently." Noriko linked her arm through Kodachi's and walked her to the door of the library and out into the hall. "And, according to the same little birdie, those bids are coming from some, shall we say, talented individuals."</p><p>"The little birdie wouldn't happen to be Karasu, would it?" Kodachi asked in amusement.</p><p>"Why yes, yes it is." Noriko replied. "And if anyone would know, she would."</p><p>"True." Admitted Kodachi. The two woman walked along the hallway and toward the stairwell. Kodachi stopped at the top of the stairs. "How talented?" She asked.</p><p>Noriko unlinked her arm from Kodachi and held her hands apart. "About that talented." Noriko replied. "And, again according to Karasu, they know how to use them."</p><p>"Indeed." Kodachi said. They started walking down the stairs. "Not that I'm agreeing to anything, you understand." Kodachi began. "But, um, exactly how interesting were the bids?" Kodachi asked. Noriko leaned over and whispered into Kodachi's ear. Kodachi's eyebrow rose. "Really?" She asked. Noriko nodded. "Interesting."</p><p>"that's what I said." Noriko replied.</p><p>"So you did." Kodachi said. "So you did."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Good afternoon and welcome back to our extended version of Japan Tonight." The pretty reporter said into the camera. "I'm your host, Saatchi Kato." She smiled. "Well our last guest was certainly blunt." She said. "But what else could you expect from Japan's hardest nosed police officer?" She said. "Despite some of his criticisms it's obvious there is a great deal of respect, maybe even affection, between Captain Noriudo and the Ice Queen." She touched her ear for a second. "I've just learned that Kodachi Kuno has arrived." She stood. "Ladies and gentlemen, Kodachi Kuno."</p><p>Kodachi entered from stage left and walked over to the reporter. The reporter's bow was deep and respectful. "Ms. Kuno. A pleasure." The reporter said.</p><p>Kodachi waved a finger. "Now is that any way for friends to greet each other, Saatchi?" She admonished in a teasing tone. "I distinctly requested you call me Kodachi."</p><p>The reporter flushed. "I didn't want to presume... Kodachi." The reporter replied. 'Friends?' She thought in pleasure. She waved to a chair. "Please sit." She said. "So, the big day is finally here." She said once Kodachi was seated.</p><p>"It's about time." Kodachi said with a quiet laugh. "The Kuno family has been without a Lady Kuno for far too long." She said. "I'm just gratified my brother found someone of the caliber of Nabiki Tendo." She said. "I had despaired of my brother finding anyone suitable." She leaned forward. "He was a terrible playboy, you know."</p><p>The reporter smiled and nodded in agreement. "He did cut a swath through most of the eligible young women, didn't he?" She said. "I hope you'll forgive me, but I've been puzzled by something." The reporter said. Kodachi waved a hand to continue. "For nearly three years we've been referring to your brother as Lord Kuno, but...isn't your father...he still lives doesn't he?"</p><p>Kodachi snorted. "Oh indeed. Father is alive and well but...for reasons I can't get into at the moment, he decided to abdicate his position in favor of Tatewaki." Kodachi leaned forward again. "Father spends most of his time in Hawaii these days anyway." She sighed. "In fact, he won't be attending the wedding." She informed the reporter. 'Thank heavens for that.' Kodachi thought. "Father has sent his regrets and he will be sorely missed." She added.</p><p>"I see." The reporter replied.</p><p>"However, the Tendo and Saotome families attendance will more than make up for his absence." Kodachi continued. "Especially Soun Tendo." Kodachi smiled slightly. "He is a most forgiving and gracious man and it will be an honor to be related to him, even if only by marriage."</p><p>"And speaking of marriage, there's been such secrecy." She said. "For example, we don't even know if the wedding is going to be a traditional or western ceremony." she raised an inquiring eyebrow.</p><p>"Oh ho ho ho." Laughed Kodachi. "And here I thought you were a reporter." She said teasingly. "Forgive me, that was unkind." She said in immediate said. "I must admit, there is something to be said for the pomp and grandeur of a western sytle wedding." Kodachi said. "However, both the Tendo and Kuno familes are devoutly Buddhist and very traditional." She explained. "And as such, the ceremony itself will be conducted by a Shinto priest and Lady Kuno will wear an Uchikake while my brother will, of course, wear a formal Kuno kimono."</p><p>"Of course." The reporter replied. "Well I know you are very busy and need to get back." She said. "And I want to thank you again for taking time out of what must be an incredibly hectic schedule but...one last question?" She asked. Kodachi nodded. "Kimi Ota." The reporter said.</p><p>"Lady Kimi." Corrected Kodachi. "As you recall, Nabiki Tendo, the soon to be Lady Kuno, has adopted Lady Kimi as her sister, and I suppose I'm not giving too much away, Lady Kimi will be Lady Kuno's heir." Kodachi shrugged. "Oh I suppose calling her Lady Kimi is somewhat inaccurate, but there is a great deal of affection between my brother , Nabiki Tendo and Lady Ota. To be honest, I find it very easy to call her Lady Kimi." Kodachi averred. "It's been a privilege and an honor to know her and, a personal pleasure,to consider her a friend."</p><p>"I see." The reporter said again. "Well thank you again, Kodachi." The reporter said. "I hope we can speak again," The reporter smiled. "Once things quiet down." The reporter turned to the camera. "More of the wedding, when we come back."</p><p>"And off." Called the director.</p><p>"Before you go, Kodachi." The reporter said. "And completely off the record." She promised. Kodachi raised an eyebrow and nodded. The reporter leaned forward. "Don't you worry that people may find out that Lady Kimi shares your brother's bed?" She asked in a near whisper.</p><p>Kodachi raised an imperious eyebrow. "I hope this isn't some tiresome attempt at blackmail, Ms. Kato." Kodachi said in warning tones.</p><p>The reporter blanched. "Forgive me, Ms. Kuno, that was not my intention." The reporter said hurriedly. "Please believe me when I tell you that such stories won't be coming from me." She explained. "I-I was just expressing concern." She continued. "The Ice Queen has done so much good it would be a shame..." She broke off. "Please forgive me."</p><p>Kodachi gave the reporter a penetrating stare. "I think I believe you." She said finally. "Saatchi." Kodachi smiled slightly as the reporter gave a sigh of relief. "I trust we'll be able to count on you ensuring that such rumors are considered just that, rumors."</p><p>"You have my word, Ms. Kuno." The reporter promised in earnest tones.</p><p>"Kodachi." Corrected Kodachi. Kodachi tapped her lips with a finger. "Are you still interested in doing a story on the club?" She asked in apparent non-sequitor. The reporter nodded. "Excellent, Noriko will be in touch."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Five people, five very attractive people, walked into the Kuno mansion. Ranma, with Akane and Ukyo on his arms, and walking slightly ahead of them, the teens Pema and Kagomi. Ranma was wearing a expensive looking steel gray silk suit. He seemed the embodiament of the masculine ideal except for the fact that he was wearing reddish eyeshadow, matching lipstick and his too perfect complexion indicated that more than his eyes and lips benefited from makeup. Akane and Ukyo, both wore very low cut, and hip slitted dresses. Akane's gown was an electric blue while Ukyo, in deference to the wedding, forgoed her usual silver-white and instead wore a gown of cream yellow. The teens, wore matching and brightly colored, Yukata Kimono in green and peach.</p><p>"Omigod, omigod." Chattered Kagomi. "I can't believe I'm here." She exclaimed.</p><p>"Relax, Kagomi." Akane said. "It's just a wedding."</p><p>"Just a wedding?" Kagomi exclaimed in disbelief. "That's easy for you to say; you're, you're Akane Tendo. Founding member of the NWC, one of the Terrible three, not to mention one of the hottest strippers in Japan and drop dead gorgeous." She said.</p><p>"That she is." Ukyo agreed. Ranma nodded firmly in agreement.</p><p>"Sister of bride, former love interest of the groom. These are the people you grew up with." Kagomi pointed out. "I'm just some shop girl who got lucky."</p><p>"Maybe so, sugar." Ukyo said cheerfully. "But do you really think you'd be here if we all didn't think there was something special about you?"</p><p>"Well." Kagomi said in hesitant tones.</p><p>"No." Ukyo said firmly. "Oh you got your foot in the door when you became Pema's girlfriend. But you've earned your place." She pointed out. "Right, Pema?"</p><p>"That right." Pema said. "You listen to Ukyo. She tell truth." She said. "Pema knew, when Pema met Kagomi, that Kagomi special." She declared. Pema grinned. "And not just because Kagomi lots fun, right Ranma?"</p><p>"That's right, punkin." Ranma replied. "Relax, Kagomi, you belong." Ranma grinned. "Though you do need to practice your...oral technique a little more."</p><p>"Ranma." Kagomi exclaimed in embarrassment.</p><p>"Don't listen to him, Kagomi." Akane elbowed Ranma in the ribs. "He's just saying that because he wants you to do it again."</p><p>"Now?" Kagomi and Pema chorused hopefully.</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "Maybe after the wedding." He said. "Speaking of which, don't you two girls have some baby sitting to do?"</p><p>"Oh noes." Exclaimed Pema. "We need go." Pema grabbed Kagomi's arm. "We see you later at wedding." Pema said. She and Kagomi hurried away.</p><p>Pema and Kagomi almost ran through the hallways of the Kuno mansion until they reached a door. Pema knocked and opened the door. Their ears were immediately assaulted by the squeals and giggles of nearly a dozen nine and ten year old girls in various states of dress. These girls were the friends and team-mates of one little girl who seemed to be their leader. Kiko. The girls turned toward the door as it opened. "Pema." The girls shouted in gleeful unison. "Kagomi." Immediately the two teens were surrounded by the adolescents.</p><p>"Hello everyones." Pema said in happy greeting. Pema clapped her hands together. "Everyones settle down." Pema said firmly. It took a little while and a few repetitions but finally the young girls quieted. "That better." Pema said in approval. "Now is everyones dressed and ready for wedding?" Pema asked. She looked around and shook her head. "It no look like everyones is ready." She said.</p><p>"That's putting it mildly." Kagomi added in an aside. She sighed. "Half of you aren't even washed." She said. "I dunno Pema, maybe we should tell Ms. Kuno to forget about using the girls in the wedding ceremony."</p><p>"No, Please." The little girls all begged. "We'll be good." They promised.</p><p>"Well, maybe it be okay." Pema raised a finger. "If everyones get washed and dressed right away." Seconds later there was a sudden flurry of little girls racing to the bathroom to wash and dress. Pema and Kagomi followed the girls around and assisted them in getting ready.</p><p>Kagomi braided ribbons into one little girl's hair. She hummed happily as she worked. 'Damn.' She thought. 'One minute I'm just plain Kagomi Akahito, shopgirl." She snuck a look over to where Pema was getting shoes on another little girl. 'And the next...' Kagomi blushed. 'Omigod, I can't believe I did that.'</p><p>"Is something wrong, Kagomi?" The little girl asked. "You're face is getting awful red."</p><p>"Nothing. It's nothing." Kagomi said hurriedly. She put a smile on her face. "Let's see how you look." Kagomi gave the girl a critical look then rocked her head in grudging approval. "I think you'll do." She said.</p><p>"You don't think it makes me look like a baby, do you?" She asked in doubtful tones. "I'm ten, you know." She said in confiding tones. "Almost a teenager." She said. "So I shouldn't look like a baby." She leaned forward. "Do you think I could wear..." She swallowed. "You know...makeup?"</p><p>"Makeup?" Squealed a dozen girls in unison. "If Michiko gets to wear makeup, I should wear makeup." One girl said loudly. "I'm older." It took a moment before Pema and Kagomi recognized the voice as belonging to Kiko.</p><p>"Well I don't know..." Began Kagomi.</p><p>"Please!" Squealed a dozen girls including Kiko.</p><p>"What do you think, Pema?" Kagomi asked.</p><p>Pema tapped her lower lip with a finger then walked over to the door and pressed a button. "Hello, Mr. Cook?"</p><p>"Hello, Pema." The man's voice replied from the speaker. "Can I help you?"</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Cook." Pema replied. "Pema looking for Kiko momma, you know where?"</p><p>"Is there a problem with Kiko?" The cooked asked in a voice full of concern.</p><p>"No problem, Mr. Cook." Pema replied in reassuring tones. "Just need ask Koko question."</p><p>There was a click from the speaker."Hello Pema." Koko's voice came from the speaker. "What's the question?"</p><p>"Little girls no think they little girls no more." Pema said. "Little girls think they young ladies." there was a shout of agreement from behind Pema.</p><p>"Young ladies, eh?" Koko's voice was amused. "And what do the young ladies want?"</p><p>"Makeup!" Shouted the young girls at the speaker. "I'll bring my makeup case." Koko replied with a chuckle. "Ten minutes."</p><p>"Thank you, Koko." Pema replied. Pema turned back to the group of pre-teens. "Okay, problem solved." Pema raised a finger. "But there be no pushing." Pema said. "Kiko."</p><p>"Yes, Pema?" Kiko replied.</p><p>"You help make sure no pushing, yes?" Pema asked. Kiko nodded firmly. "Good." Pema said in approval.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Good afternoon and welcome back to Japan Tonight." The pretty reporter almost gushed into the camera. "Well with the wedding only hours away, we thought we'd show you where the wedding will take place." The camera shifted to show an outdoor scene. The rolling and extensive back lawn of the Kuno estate had been decorated for the wedding. White folding chairs had been set out. From the number of chairs set out, it was obvious that there would be hundreds of guests. The chairs had been set up in two sections with a wide aisle separating the two sections. At one end was a wide flower bedecked arch that stood on a low platform. The camera showed two priest already kneeling on the platform and chanting. The television audience could see the smoke coming from two censors stationed on either side of the arch.</p><p>"Rumors abound as to the guest list. Members of the Diet, business leaders and several top entertainers and Idols are expected to show." The reporter said. "Why there is even a rumor that the Emperor and Empress themselves may attend." She shook her head. "While unlikely, it's an indication of the interest and importance of the event that fuel such speculation." The reporter said. "regardless, the guest list has been a closely guarded secret." The reporter smiled. "I suppose we'll just have to find out...together." She said. "I don't know about you, but I can't wait." She all but squealed.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A helicopter touched down in a somewhat secluded section of the rolling Kuno grounds. A double row of Kuno retainers lined the path from the landing platform to the mansion itself. Standing at the head of the ranks of retainers stood six people in three rows. The first row was comprised of Tatewaki Kuno and Nabiki Tendo, the second Kimi Ota and Sasuke, the third Kodachi Kuno and Noriko Mata It was hard to determine which of the six was the most nervous. Even the Ice Queen's legendary icy demeanor seemed inadequate for the situation.</p><p>"I can't believe they accepted." Kimi whispered nervously to Nabiki.</p><p>"I know." Nabiki whispered back.</p><p>Two obviously military men exited from the helicopter first and then several additional military people followed and lined up to form two rows, matching the Kuno retainers. For several minutes nothing else happened and then a middle aged couple exited from the helicopter. Immediately the double row of Kuno retainers dropped to one knee. Tatewaki, Nabiki, Kimi, Sasuke, Kodachi and Noriko didn't kneel but did bow nearly in half.</p><p>Tatewaki waved a hand and the kneeling retainers stood. "Kuno." He exclaimed. "The Emperor."</p><p>"Banzai." Shouted the retainers. "Banzai." The retainers immediately returned to their kneeling positions.</p><p>"Lord Kuno." The Emperor said in greeting.</p><p>Tatewaki bowed his head. "Tenshi." He replied in respectful greeting. "You honor me."</p><p>The Emperor of Japan smiled. "My wife, the Empress Michiko." He said in introduction.</p><p>"Your majesty." Tatewaki replied. "A great honor." He said. The empress nodded. "May I introduce my intended, Nabiki Tendo. Lady Kuno." Tatewaki said.</p><p>"Lady Kuno." The emperor said in greeting. He smiled. "I've been hearing such interesting things about you."</p><p>Nabiki struggled to remain impassive. "Your Majesty." Nabiki replied. "I hope what you've heard wasn't too disturbing."</p><p>The emperor laughed. "Disturbing? No." He replied. "Fascinating. Yes." The Emperor gave Nabiki an approving look. "I hope you continue to...fascinate."</p><p>"I will do my best, your highness." Nabiki replied in her best Ice Queen voice.</p><p>"Fascinating." Murmured the Emperor.</p><p>"My Lady's companion, Kimi Ota." Tatewaki continued indicating Kimi Ota. "Lady Kuno and I call her Lady Kimi."</p><p>"Than we shall as well." The Emperor replied. He turned his head. "A pleasure, Lady Kimi."</p><p>"Your majesty." Squeaked Kimi Ota. The Emperor nodded his head.</p><p>"My Sister. Kodachi Kuno." Tatewaki continued. Kodachi bowed again. "Her aide and companion, Noriko Mata." Noriko copied Kodachi's bow. "And finally, my personal retainer and best man for the wedding, Sasuke of the Kuno." Sasuke immediately dropped to one knee.</p><p>"Unusual to have a retainer as a best man." Murmured the Empress.</p><p>"Sasuke has been more than a retainer, your highness, he has been a most loyal companion and, to my good fortune, a good and true friend." Tatewaki replied. "He has been at my side through strife and battle, so it is fitting that he stand at my side on this happiest of occasions." Tatewaki said solemnly.</p><p>"Of course." The Empress said in agreement. "You are a most fortunate man, Lord Kuno."</p><p>"More fortunate than I deserve, your highness." Tatewaki replied.</p><p>The Emperor of Japan smiled knowingly, "Perhaps, Lord Kuno." The Emperor agreed. "Yet, as devout Buddhists, we should realize that fortune often comes at a price." He said. "Something I think I'd know a little bit about."</p><p>"Aye." Agreed Tatewaki. "A great fortune may exact a great price." He said. "Yet if so, then it is a price I gladly would pay."</p><p>"A most fortunate man." The Empress repeated. "Japan is served well." She declared. The Emperor nodded in agreement.</p><p>"If you'll follow me, your majesties." Tatewaki said. "My Ladies and I will escort you to your suite."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Welcome back to our special and extended version of Japan Tonight." The pretty reporter said the camera. "I'm your host, Saatchi Kato." The image switched to show the grounds where the wedding was to be held. "With the wedding scheduled to begin in less than an hour, the guests are already starting to take their seats." The reporter's voice said in narration. The camera focused in on people being ushered to their seats by a seemingly endless supply of Kuno retainers both male and female. The camera focused on several important looking men in tuxedos. "As expected, there are members of the Diet." The camera panned to a cluster of heavy set men in dark business suits. "Industrial leaders." The camera panned again to follow a very attractive woman as she followed an usher. "And movies stars." Once more the camera panned, this time to where the wedding was to take place and focused on where a standing partition had been erected off to one side of the wedding platform. "And exactly who is expected to be sitting behind that screen has been the source of incredible speculation."</p><p>The camera returned to the reporter. "Well, I have just received word that the Emperor and Empress are indeed attending." The reporter exclaimed in excitement. "And while I honestly doubt that I'll be able to interview the Emperor, just the very fact that he and the Empress are here, should do much to dispell some of the horrible rumors that have surrounded the Ice Queen."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi switched off the television. "Excellent Saatchi." Kodachi murmured. She turned. "Well ladies, unless there is an earthquake, it appears the wedding will go on." She said to the cluster of women that surrounded her. Kodachi's mouth twisted slightly. "I see Yuki has not yet returned." She said to a general giggling from the women. "We'll give her ten more minutes." She said. "Before we send someone to get her."</p><p>"Better have Koko standing by to repair her makeup and hair." Noriko said knowingly.</p><p>"Let's just hope that's all that needs to be repaired." Kodachi replied in amusement. Kodachi nodded and went to a wall panel. She pressed a button. "Cook have you seen Koko?"</p><p>"She's in the girls' suite." The cooks baritone replied. "Wait a moment."</p><p>There was a click. "I'm here, My lady." Koko's voice came from the grill. The squeals of young girls voices could be heard. "Just putting the finishing touches on our flower girls." She said. "Is there a problem?"</p><p>"Yuki still has not returned from the Morimoto's suite." Kodachi began. She stopped at the sound of laughter that came from the speaker. "I'll be there in five minutes, My lady." Koko promised. "Thank you, Koko." Kodachi replied. There was a sound of the door opening and a breathless Yuki walked into the room. "Ah, she's here." She said.</p><p>"Sorry I'm late, ." Yuki apologized. "I lost track of the time." Yuki blushed redly at the laughter that came from the surrounding girls. "Well, I did." She said plaintively.</p><p>"I suppose we can forgive you." Kodachi said. "After all , it must have been at least a week since you've last seen them." Kodachi walked over to the retainer and put her hand on Yuki's shoulder. "As long as your happy, Yuki." Kodachi said gently. "that's all that matters."</p><p>Yuki looked down for a moment. "I'm happy, Ms. Kuno." She replied quietly.</p><p>"Good." Kodachi replied. Kodachi clapped her hands together. "Okay ladies." She said. "We have less than an hour to go." She said. "With the arrival of the Emperor and Empress." Kodachi paused as her 'girls' squealed excitedly. "As I was saying, with the arrival of the Emperor and Empress, it will be part of your responsibilities to ensure that no one, and I mean no one, approaches their majesties without first clearing it with me. Is that understood?"</p><p>"Yes, Ms. Kuno." Chorused the girls.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Running a television show requires more than a cameraman and a reporter and though the audience didn't see them, there were nearly a dozen people running the entire show. Besides Saatchi and the cameraman, there was the director. A grip handled the lights and other equipment. And there was a bank of young men and women sitting at a number of computer terminals. As different people were identified their names would appear under them on the screen for the viewers at home. Courtesy of the young men and women sitting at the terminals.</p><p>Saatchi watched her own monitor and nodded in approval as the names appeared. At times she make a comment or two. One young couple was focused on. "As if anyone needs to be told who that is." The reporter said in slightly jealous tones. "She's obviously a Tendo. Kasumi Tendo. The eldest Tendo sister and some say, with a lot of justification, the prettiest of the Tendo girls." She said. The camera seemed to reluctantly pan away from Kasumi and focus on the man next to her. "And this lucky, and handsome, man is her fiance, Dr. Tofu Ono." She said. "Nerima's most prominent physician."</p><p>The camera panned away and focused on another. An actor. Panned away again. A Councilor. The camera panned again. "Konatsu Kanzen." The reporter said in barely suppressed excitement. "Oh my." She whispered. "I promise you, I will be interviewing her." She said. "If not today then soon." She said. The camera panned to the side. "Ryoga Hibiki." She said in awestruck tones. "Hard to believe he defended his title just last night." She said. "He doesn't even have a scratch on him." The camera panned again. "And wherever you find Konatsu and Ryoga, you find supermodel, Ting Li." The camera focused on the orange haired and exotic looking woman at Ryoga's side.</p><p>Again the camera panned away and resumed picking out the different dignitarys in attendance. There was a small cluster of tough looking men, surrounded by an impressive display of very attractive women. The camera moved on quickly.</p><p>With a sound somewhere between a dulcimer and a harp the almost etheral music of the koto filled the afternoon air. The guests kept their conversations low but as there were hundreds of guests the murmur added a subtle counterpoint to the traditional music. Sitting in a large tent along with her cameramen, the reporter, Saatchi Kato began a quiet almost hushed narrative of the events.</p><p>"With the playing of the Koto, it appears the wedding is about to begin." Saatchi Kato said quietly. Saatchi motioned one cameraman to focus at the rear section of the assemblage. The television audience had the image of the reporter replaced with what the camera was seeing. A group of girls, no more than ten or eleven in age had begun to line up. Each adolescent girl was wearing a blue and white skirt and blouse combination and each carried a large basket. The adolescent girls began to walk slowly down the wide aisle between the two sections of seats. "I see Ms. Kuno decided to keep a few surprises intact." The reporter said in amusement. "Flower girls." Standing at the rear of the adolescent girls were two attractive teenaged girls in matching peach and green Kimono.</p><p>The camera followed the adolescent girls as the walked slowly toward the raised dais scattering white rose petals as the went. The camera focused on one girl walking in front of the rest. "Ms. Kuno's adopted daughter, Kiko Kuno." The reporter said quietly. "According to my sources, a formidable gymnast who , at ten, is already being scouted as a potential olympian." She said. "Considering her adopted Aunt was almost an olympian in her own right, this is not surprising."</p><p>Following the adolescents, almost herding them, were the two attractive teenaged girls. "Pema Tenzin and Kagomi Akahito." The reporter said in quiet introduction. "For those who've been living under a rock, Pema Tenzin was the young girl who had been rescued from slavers several years ago and is currently living with the Terrible Three." She said. "Kagomi Akahito is reportedly Pema's closest friend.' She said. "I remember when I first met Pema Tenzin, she was a skinny and frightened little girl." The camera focused on Pema. "Living with the Terrible Three obviously agrees with her." She said. "She's become a beauty."</p><p>"As for Ms. Akahito." The reporter continued. "Other than her being Pema's closest friend, I have little to add." The reporter said. "But you have to admit she's nearly as attractive as Ms. Tenzin." The reporters voice was filled with amusement. "I suspect we're going to be seeing and hearing a lot about these two in the coming years."</p><p>The camera continued to follow the flower girls and their teenaged guardians as they completed their trip down the center aisle and, with some obvious urging from the teen girls, into a fidgeting line near the altar. The camera caught Pema and Kagomi waving to someone in the audience and another camera focused on several people waving back. "Speaking of the Terrible Three." The reporter said as the camera panned in on the three people waving back. The reporter sighed. "Have you ever seen such beautiful people?" She asked in almost plaintive tones.</p><p>The camera returned its attention to the rear of the assembly where a distinguished looking and mustachioed man in formal kimono stood. "Soun Tendo." The reporter said in a hush. "Father of the bride." Dignified in his black and gray kimono, Soun slowly walked down the aisle,the camera followed his perambulation. When Soun reached the raised dais where the priests waited, he bowed to the priests and stepped to the side.</p><p>The camera again shifted back to the rear of the congregation. Two men stood there. One was tall, dark haired and handsome. His face had graced numerous magazine covers and appeared many times in evening newscasts. Usually in the company of a young starlet or society girl. For many years since graduating high school and through his years in college speculation had been rife over who, if anyone, he would marry. Today, the speculation ended. Tatewaki Kuno, Lord Kuno, was getting married.</p><p>Standing next to Tatewaki was a short and snaggle toothed man who looked extremely uncomfortable in his formal kimono. The camera caught Tatewaki placing a hand on the shoulder of the shorter man. "According to information released by Kodachi Kuno, the man standing with Lord Kuno is Sasuke, one of Lord Kuno's chief retainers and, and Ms. Kuno would like this empasized, probably one of Lord Kuno's oldest and dearest friends." She said. "And isn't that who should be standing with him?" She asked rhetorically.</p><p>There was a sudden increase in the background murmur. Tatewaki and Sasuke turned.. The camera caught the approaching procession. At first, all that could be seen was a large red umbrella. The camera zoomed in. "Oh. My. God." The reporter said in awe. The reason for the reporter's exclamation became apparent. A traditional Japanese wedding kimono, the Uchikake, is white and this one was no exception. From head to toe, Nabiki was in white. It was a blinding white, the white of freshly fallen snow, the white of the Ice Queen. Even her makeup seemed designed to enhance and reflect the whiteness of her kimono. Nabiki looked almost etheral. "You just know that kimono is going to end up in a museum somewhere." The reporter said. "We will try to get a closeup of the material to see what pattern has been woven into it." The reporter promised her audience.</p><p>The camera panned a close up on Tatewaki's face. There was a chuckle. "I believe Lord Kuno approves." Came the reporters quiet voice. "What do the American's say?" The reporter continued. "Oh yes, he looks 'blown away'." She said.</p><p>As was traditional for the Uchikake, the kimono was so long that if not held up, would have prevented Nabiki from walking. That function fell to a woman in a magnificient red and gold kimono. Kimi Ota. Where Nabiki's makeup was pale, Kimi's was a firey match to her kimono.</p><p>Walking just behind Nabiki and Kimi and wearing a Tomesode kimono was Nodoka. The top half of her kimono was black as was traditional while the overlaying skirt was in hues of peach and green, and in fact very similar in design to the Kimono worn by Pema and Kagomi. "Nodoka Saotome." The reporter said as the name appeared below Nodoka on the screen. The mother of Ranma Saotome and surrogate mother for the Tendo girls." Saatchi said. "Gods, I hope I look half that good when I'm her age." Following Nodoka and wearing matching Furisode kimono in shades of peach, pink and white were Kodachi and Noriko.</p><p>Nabiki, with Kimi's help, walked to stand at Tatewaki's and Nabiki looked into each other's eyes for a long moment before Nabiki dropped her eyes demurely. They turned toward the dais at the end of the aisle .Two women in black and red kimono walked to stand in front of the wedding party. The wedding party bowed to the two women and then the two women began to walk down the aisle. The wedding party slowly followed. The camera followed the party and the reporter remained silent letting the imagery speak for itself. The wedding party reached the dais. The two women in black and red, the Miko, bowed to the priests before ascending to the dais.</p><p>Tatewaki took a deep breath then he too bowed to the priests. His actions were copied by Sasuke and the two men ascended on to the dais. Then Nabiki bowed and, with a lot of help from Kimi, climbed the steps to stand on the dais. Nodoka went to stand next to Soun.</p><p>Once they had assembled on the dais, Tatewaki and Nabiki turned to the partitioned section and bowed. Kimi and Sasuki also bowed, though a half second after Tatewaki and Nabiki. After a few seconds Nabiki and Tatewaki turned back to the priests. "For those who have not figured it out, the Emperor and Empress are behind the partition." The reporter said in a hush. Saatchi Kato licked her lips in anticipation. 'I am so going to renegoitiate my contract.' She thought cheerfully.'Again.' She licked her lips again, this time to moisten them. 'I know I said this before, but only a fool can continue to believe the outrageous rumors that have swirled around Lady Kuno. I mean, the Emperor for the gods sakes." She said. "Oh, the Mikos are pouring the sake." She said excitedly..</p><p>One Miko picked up a bowl of sake and offered it to bowed and took the bowl. He turned the bowl in a half circle and took three quick sips of the sake, emptying the bowl. He bowed again and held out the bowl. The bowl was taken by the Miko and refilled. This time the bowl was offered to Nabiki who repeated Tatewaki's manner of drinking the sake. "How graceful." The reporter said in a near sigh. "But what else would you expect from the Ice Queen?"</p><p>Perhaps it was the presence of the Emperor and Empress, perhaps it was sense of history being made but even the priests appeared caught up in the moment. Their voices soared as they chanted their blessing over the couple. The Shimi wands were waved, prayers were chanted and the Koto continued to play in the background. The wedding seemed to go on and on yet no one, not the participants, not the assembled guests and certainly not Tatewaki or Nabiki seemed to care. A slow pan of the audience showed a singularly rapt look of attention on all their faces. Yet, even the most prolonged and dramatic of ceremonies has an end and this one was no exception. With a final chant, a final chord of the Koto and a final set of bows the wedding ended.</p><p>Tatewaki extended his hand to Nabiki. Nabiki placed her hand on top of Tatewaki's and, again with a lot of help from Kimi, they descended from the Dais. There was a sudden susseration from the congregation. It started near the back of the large gathering. The camera panned over to one side of the grounds just as an open white carraige, drawn by two white horses, rounded from behind a small copse of trees. The carriage stopped in front of Nabiki, Tatewaki and Kimi. Tatewaki helped Nabiki into the carriage. For a moment Kimi seemed about to turn away when the camera captured Tatewaki extending his hand to Kimi. Kimi again hesitated and this time the camera caught Nabiki lean toward Kimi from inside the carriage. Whatever she said made Kimi laugh. She took Tatewaki's hand and he guided her on to the carriage where she sat in the seat opposite Nabiki. Tatewaki waited until both Nabiki and Kimi were settled and then, with a bow to Sasuke, he leapt into the carriage and sat down next to Nabiki. With a crack of the whip the driver drove the carraige away.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I am so glad that's over." Nabiki said in relief. She, Kimi and Nodoka had returned to the suite Nabiki has used earlier in getting prepared. "Now someone help me out of this thing."</p><p>"Not just yet, Nabiki dear." Nodoka cautioned. "There is still the official wedding pictures." She smiled at Nabiki's groan. "Don't worry, we'll make it as quick and painless as possible." She promiised. "Now, we have just enough time to repair your makeup." She said cheerfully. "Yours too, Kimi." Nodoka smiled. "Excuse me, Lady Kimi."</p><p>"Auntie." Kimi mock protested. "Not you too?"</p><p>"Well if the Emperor is calling you Lady Kimi, who am I to argue?" Nodoka said.</p><p>"Who indeed?" Nabiki said in agreement. Nabiki sighed. "Pictures, huh?"</p><p>"Pictures." Nodoka agreed.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was a strange tableau. Standing in the middle of a large group of people were Tatewaki, Nabiki on his right, and Kimi, standing on Tatewaki's left. Standing to the right of Nabiki were the Emperor and Empress. Standing to the left, next to Kimi were Nodoka and Soun. The rest of the group was a wide assortment of the denizens of Nerima. Ranma, Akane and Ukyo were there, of course. As was Kodachi, Noriko and Kodachi's special girls. Including Kiko, who was surrounded by her own retinue of ten year old girls.</p><p>Ryoga was there with Konatsu and Ting Li each possesively holding on to one of Ryoga's massive arms. Soun and Gema had somehow found a Shogi board and were playing in a corner., Kasumi and Ono were in deep conversation with Nodoka, two young men who stood behind Nodoka smiled politely but saying little. A purple haired chinese woman leaned against a wall and watched the whole group.</p><p>That wasn't what was strange. What was strange was that every so often a group of people would move off to a separate section and stand as if posing and there would be a flash as from a camera. What was stranger was that everyone seemed to think there was nothing strange at all. Except for two people.</p><p>"Excuse me, Lord Kuno." The Emperor said in slghtly confused tones.</p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty?" Tatewaki replied. "Smile everyone." Tatewaki said. They smiled and there was a flash. "You were saying, your Majesty?"</p><p>"Where is the photographer?" The Emperor asked.</p><p>"Ah." Tatewaki replied. He pointed. "There, your majesty." There was nothing where Tatewaki was pointing. "Show yourself, sorceror." Tatewaki demanded. "Your Emperor commands."</p><p>"Lord Kuno?" The Emperor began. Then he stopped as a figure appeared less than twenty feet away. The figure was a man, possibly in his late twenties, Or eighties. Or dead. It was hard to tell. The man seemed more ghost than living man with his pale white skin, and lank black hair. "Gods." The emperor exclaimed. The Empress gasped after in counterpoint.</p><p>"Hikaru Gosunkugi, your majesty." Tatewaki said in introduction. The corpselike man bowed. "Fear not, he's harmless."</p><p>"Mostly harmless." Nabiki corrected.</p><p>"Mostly harmless." Tatewaki said in agreement. "And very useful." Tatewaki turned to the Emperor. "And loyal, your majesty." He said. "As are we all."</p><p>"So I've been advised." The Emperor replied. He looked at Gosunkugi intently for a moment and then turned to look at Nabiki. "You have interesting associates, Ice Queen." He said. "We'd like to meet some of them." The Emperor smiled.</p><p>"Starting with Ranma Saotome."The empress said in anticipatory tones. "Is it true he changes into a woman?"</p><p>"Yes, you majesty." Nabiki replied.</p><p>"Fascinating." Said the Emperor.</p><p>End Wedding Belles</p><p>Author's Notes: I've been sitting on this side story for some time. In fact I had forgot about it until I started working on another Queen Rat episode. So rather than wait until I complete QR Book 8, I thought I'd release it now. Enjoy.</p>
