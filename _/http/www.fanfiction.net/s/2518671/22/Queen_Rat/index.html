</div><p>Chapter 4</p><p>'Ice Queen'</p><p>Kyoshi Narumi entered the restaurant, His eyes, and the eyes of his two bodyguards, quickly assessed the situation. An attractive young brunette, wearing a floral kimono, approached. She bowed.</p><p>"Good evening Mr. Narumi." She said. "If you will follow me. Your guards can wait at the bar."</p><p>Something about the young woman caused Kyoshi to pause. "Go to the bar boys." He said finally. The two guards looked at each other for a moment then with a short bow walked away. Kyoshi waved a hand. "After you." He said.</p><p>"Of course Mr. Narumi." The young woman said. She turned and led the Yakusa gang leader into the back of the restaurant. There was a large round table around which a number of people were already sitting. An attractive blond stood.</p><p>"Mr. Narumi." Nabiki Tendo said in apparent pleasure. "You've come." She turned to the young woman. "Konatsu please get Mr. Narumi a drink. Scotch neat isn't it Mr. Narumi?"</p><p>Kyoshi smiled in grudging admiration. "Yes it is." He bowed. "I assume you must be the Ice Queen."</p><p>"I've been called that. Let me introduce you to the rest of my guests. I believe you know some of them." Nabiki waved a hand. "Tokio Wasamara; Kuro Asura, Ken Amato, Ky Young Ji," Each of the men nodded respectfully to Kyoshi as their name was spoken.</p><p>"I know all of them." Corrected Kyoshi. He bowed respectfully. "Colleagues in fact." Kyoshi sat down at the last vacant seat. "However, I don't know your," He looked at the two people, a man and a woman, who flanked Nabiki. "Partners?" He hazarded. He grunted a thank you as Konatsu returned with a drink. He sipped and then sat back waiting.</p><p>"Partners will do." Nabiki replied. She waved a hand to her right. "This is Su, my right hand." She said "The gentleman to my left is Tatewaki Kuno." She smiled at the sounds of recognition coming from the assembled gang leaders. "I, as you guessed, have been called the Ice Queen. That name will do or you can call me." She smiled sharklike. "Oyabun."</p><p>"Oyabun?" One of the assembled gangsters said in disbelief. "You? A woman?</p><p>"Shut up Wasamara." Kyoshi said sharply. "I want to hear the lady out."</p><p>"But a woman." Tokio Wasamara said angrily.</p><p>"Stop acting like an idiot, Wasamara." Kyoshi said sharply. He looked at Nabiki. "I've been hearing about the Ice Queen for a year now. I like what I hear." He said. "And what I like most is that you got someone who can stop Nakamura."</p><p>"You're well informed Mr. Narumi." Nabiki said approvingly.</p><p>"Kyoshi please." Kyoshi replied. "I try to be." He said. "It helps." He looked around the table. "Quite a group you've assembled." He smiled. "Mari."</p><p>"Very good Kyoshi." Nabiki purred. "Go on. I'm interested in your thoughts."</p><p>"I'm thinking that in a year you have successfully carved out your own not inconsiderable territory. More importantly, you've held it. I also noticed that none of the people here represent territory that has been affected." Kyoshi nodded. "You've selected people who have no reason to resent you." He rubbed his lower lip with his thumb and forefinger. "You also selected a group of people whose territories, though close to each other, don't overlap. So we have no reason to resent each other."</p><p>"You also represent five of the largest territories closest to my own and you have no love for Hikaru Nakamura." Nabiki noticed that several of the other gangsters were sitting up and paying attention. Tokio Wasamara still looked a little hostile. 'I can win him over.' Nabiki thought to herself. 'All I need is the right carrot.' She smiled. "Now, normally I don't think you'd have paid attention to me and my little operation until I started to," Nabiki rubbed the tip of her nose. "Expand." She said finally.</p><p>Kyoshi snorted in appreciation. "You're playing a dangerous game Mari." He said after a moment. "What are you proposing?"</p><p>"Gentlemen." Nabiki said seriously. "We all have a problem. The same problem. Hikaru Nakamura. He's making a move to take over all the Yakusa families in and around Tokyo. He thinks there isn't anyone with balls enough to resist him." She smiled at the angry murmur her words brought. "Now, I can just deal with him with my own, not inconsiderable resources, after I let him wear himself out against all of you first, of course."</p><p>"He's already taken over the Satoh Family." Tokio retorted. "Even the five of us together wouldn't be enough."</p><p>"Not without some help, no." Agreed Nabiki. "My group can swing the balance. She looked at Tokio Wasamura. "Would you consider a sixth of the Satoh territory an acceptable inducement Tokio?"</p><p>Kyoshi started to chuckle in appreciation. "Got you there Tokio. You're territory would double wouldn't it?" He said. "An interesting proposal. Join with the Ice Queen and possibly increase our territory or reject her proposal and watch our territory be swallowed up, one by one, by Nakamura . Is that what you're proposing Mari?" He asked.</p><p>Nabiki nodded sharply. "Hikaru doesn't like competition." She said. "He won't be satisfied with just taking over your territories." Her shark-like smile returned. "I have no such concerns."</p><p>"What's the price?" Asked Tokio Wasamura. "There's always a price."</p><p>'Gotcha.' Nabiki thought triumphantly though she let none of her glee show on her face. "We return to the old ways." She said. "Smuggling, protection, loans. Fine." She said firmly. "We stop the drugs and the weapons." She said. "And we stop them hard."</p><p>"What about gambling? What about prostitution?" Demanded Tokio.</p><p>"Not an issue with one exception." Nabiki said. "Your girls are under my protection. I have no problem with prostitution but I have a problem with them being mistreated."</p><p>Tokio Wasamura rubbed his chin. 'The bitch is smart, I'll give her that.' He thought. Tokio shrugged. "Sure, you wanna play big sister to the whores, go ahead. What else?"</p><p>"Nerima is mine." Nabiki said coldly. "All of it." She placed a hand on Tatewaki's shoulder. "And it's not negotiable." That caused a stirring among the assembled gang leaders.</p><p>"You're asking a lot, we all have a piece of Nerima." Kyoshi remarked.</p><p>"It's ours." Tatewaki rumbled. "It's a small price to pay for what you will receive in return."</p><p>"I was wonderin when you'd talk." Tokio said in amusement. "It's your hometown." He smiled his own shark smile. "Kyoshi isn't the only one who gets information."</p><p>"No one said you were stupid, Tokio." Nabiki said coolly. "The question is; how smart are you?"</p><p>"Smart enough not to jump in without looking." Tokio replied. He looked at Tatewaki. "What do you get out of this, rich boy?"</p><p>"Richer." Tatewaki replied.</p><p>Tokio laughed. "Now that's an answer I can believe." He jerked his head at Nabiki. "Think she can deliver?"</p><p>Tatewaki smiled coldly. "Oh of that I have no doubt. As long as you do your part." Tatewaki ran his gaze around the table. "I am a Kuno. A Kuno does not give his fealty lightly. There is one more thing we know about the five of you; you too long for the old ways. You too want to return to the days when you were considered patriots, when you had respect." He reached out and grasped the air. "It is within your grasp, If you but take it."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru Nakamura slammed the telephone down. "Who's Tatewaki Kuno?" Hikaru asked.<p>"A rich fool." Cologne replied. "With a small talent with a sword." She puffed her pipe. "Why?"</p><p>"That's who she's fucking." Hikaru replied angrily. "That's why."</p><p>"Calm yourself son-in-law." Cologne replied soothingly. 'We have other things to concern ourselves with." She tapped her chin with the stem of the pipe as she considered her words. "Why have you not completed your takeover?" She said. 'This one has no self control.' She thought in resignation. 'We may need to eliminate him once the takeover is completed.' She looked at Hikaru. "Well?"</p><p>"Ah, you know how some of the families are." Hikaru grumbled. "They gotta make a show over considering all the options." His grumble became a growl. "Apparently there has been an offer to form an alliance of several other families."</p><p>"This is not good news, son-in-law." Cologne said sharply. "What do you know about this alliance?"</p><p>"Nothing as yet." Hikaru replied. "I wouldn't even have known about it if I hadn't decided to check with my informant inside Ky Young Ji's organization. He told me Ky was considering another offer. My informant told me that he believes Tokio Wasamura and Kyoshi Narumi are considering the same offer."</p><p>"Unfortunate." Cologne puffed her pipe.</p><p>"More unfortunate than you realize." Hikaru replied angrily. "Wasamura and Narumi control some real territory. And they're both smart. Too smart. I would have had to replace them anyway."</p><p>"Perhaps they've realized that possibility as well and decided to join together against you." Cologne tapped her chin with the stem of the pipe again. "I think it would be best if we don't allow this to develop any further." She said. "An example must be made and it must be very public."</p><p>Hikaru nodded in agreement. "I agree and I think the target should be Narumi. He falls the rest will fold." He smiled. "It's Thursday. Narumi always eats at the same restaurant every Thursday."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki Kuno ducked his head into the restaurant and looked around before fully entering. Entering right behind him were Nabiki and Kimi. Tatewaki held his arm out. "Wait a moment." He said firmly. His eyes finished scanning the empty restaurant. Finally he nodded in satisfaction. "It's safe."<p>"Taking the knight in shining armor a bit far, don't you think lover?" Kimi asked cheerfully.</p><p>"Better to overdo then to fail my charge my lady." A smiling Tatewaki replied.</p><p>"Oh let him have his fun Kimi." Nabiki said. She leaned against Tatewaki and looked up at the tall swordsman. "I think it's sweet." She patted Tatewaki on his broad chest. "Good boy." Nabiki turned as a familiar figure approached.</p><p>"Mari." Kyoshi Narumi said in greeting.</p><p>"Kyoshi." Nabiki said in pleased tones. "I was very happy to get your invitation." She walked over and linked her arm through his. "I didn't expect you to make a decision so quickly though."</p><p>Kyoshi smiled down at Nabiki. He then nodded to Kimi and then Tatewaki. "It was an easy decision." Kyoshi said. He led his guests to a table at the back of the empty restaurant. A waiter appeared and placed a large saki bottle and several cups on the table. Kyoshi waved his guests to their seats and poured saki into one cup. He looked at Nabiki then raised the cup and took a long sip.</p><p>Nabiki nodded in appreciation at the gesture. She picked up the bottle and poured saki into her own cup, raised it and took a sip. "Trust is a rare commodity Kyoshi." She said. She placed the cup back on the table. "But a necessary one if we are to be successful."</p><p>"I agree." Kyoshi replied somberly. "But as important as trust may be, I believe vision is more important." Kyoshi turned his attention to Tatewaki. "You were right rich boy." He said. "I do want a return to the days you described."</p><p>"You had that look." Tatewaki replied. "I recognized it at once. It was the same look that I see every time I shave." Tatewaki bowed his head slightly. "It is a difficult path is it not?"</p><p>Kyoshi sat back in his chair. "You know, for a rich boy, you're pretty smart." He said musingly. He gave Tatewaki a returning nod. "Difficult but better." He leaned forward again. "I'm in." He announced. He looked at Nabiki. "Oyabun." He bowed his head again.</p><p>"I prefer Ice Queen." Nabiki said with a sharp smile. "But that gesture, like the first, was appreciated." Nabiki leaned back and crossed her legs. "I'm sure you've heard of the Terrible Three by now?" Nabiki smiled at Kyoshi's nod. "They work for me."</p><p>"They're the ones that stopped Hikaru and broke Satoh?" His question was hopeful. He smiled at Nabiki's nod. "I have five men I want them to train." Kyoshi said immediately. "Non-negotiable."</p><p>Nabiki's smile widened. She leaned over. "Pay up." She said to Kimi. She leaned back. "I anticipated your request; send your men to the Tendo Dojo in Nerima. They will be trained there."</p><p>"Excellent." Kyoshi's eye's suddenly narrowed at the sound of the door to the restaurant opening. "Excuse me while I tell whoever that is that the place is closed."</p><p>Tatewaki stood. "Remain here." He ordered everyone around the table. Without waiting for an answer, Tatewaki leaped over the table. A sword appeared in his hand. He assumed a guard position. "Down." He growled.</p><p>Nabiki grabbed a stunned Kimi and threw her under the table and followed. Nabiki covered Kimi's body with her own and peered out through the legs of the table. "Just stay down Kimi." Nabiki hissed quietly. She pulled out her cell phone and quickly punched in a number. "Come on. Come on." She growled.</p><p>Hikaru strode into the back of the restaurant. He laughed when he saw Tatewaki. "A sword?" He asked. "So rich boy thinks he's a swordsman." Hikaru placed the palms of his hands together then pulled them apart slowly. A ball of bright red chi formed between his palms. "But can a sword stop this?" He flung his hands toward Tatewaki sending the ball of energy streaking straight for the swordsman.</p><p>"Oh crap." Squealed Kimi.</p><p>Tatewaki swung his sword in a shining arc and intercepted the ball of energy, instead of the energy destroying the sword or the sword destroying the ball of chi, the sword instead seemed to absorb the energy. Tatewaki swung the sword again sending the ball of chi back toward Hikaru. Hikaru threw his arms protectively in front of him. The energy splashed harmlessly off a chi shield around him. Hikaru lowered his arms. Tatewaki was standing in front of him, his sword in a guard position.</p><p>"In answer to your question." Tatewaki said with a grim smile. "Yes."</p><p>Another figure walked into the room. "Hello stick boy." The lavender haired Amazon said cheerfully. "I not expect to see you here."</p><p>"Shampoo." Tatewaki said gravely. "Why am I not surprised?"</p><p>Nabiki stood up from under the table. "I'd leave if I were you. " Nabiki held up her cell phone. "Ranma is on his way."</p><p>"Mari." Hikaru said in anger.</p><p>Shampoo laughed. "Hello mercenary girl." Shampoo smiled cruelly. "Always knew you whore at heart." She turned to Hikaru. "We need go. Great grandmother need to know who true enemy is."</p><p>"Not until I finish what I came here to do." He smiled coldly. "And teach this bitch who's in charge."</p><p>"We go." Shampoo disagreed forcefully. "You not ready to face Ranma." She said. Shampoo grabbed Hikaru by his arm. He shrugged her off. "You not be bigger idiot than have to." She said. She grabbed Hikaru's arm again.</p><p>"Don't tell me what to do bitch." Hikaru snarled. His hand lashed out and slapped Shampoo across the face. "No woman tells me what to do." He turned back to Tatewaki and Nabiki. "You're dead." He growled. "You're all dead and that includes Ranma." He made to move toward Tatewaki when Shampoo's Bonbori slammed Hikaru on the side of his head. She grabbed him and slung Hikaru over her shoulder.</p><p>"We be back." She said cheerfully. Shampoo turned and raced out of the restaurant.</p><p>Tatewaki did not relax his guard until Ranma, with Akane and Ukyo trailing, raced into the restaurant. "Where is he?" Ranma growled.</p><p>"They just left Saotome." Nabiki replied. "Shampoo was with him." She nodded toward Tatewaki. "Kuno baby was able to hold Hikaru off." Nabiki smiled proudly at Tatewaki.</p><p>"Foul mouthed cretin." Grumbled Tatewaki. "But very powerful." He smiled slightly. "Reminded me a little of you."</p><p>"Oh ha ha. It is to laugh." Ranma replied sourly. He turned to see an open mouthed Kyoshi staring at all of them. "What's with you?"</p><p>"What the fuck was that?" Kyoshi nearly screamed. "Nakumura threw a ball of energy and the rich boy here acted like it was an everyday occurrence. Then this purple haired slut pops Hikaru on the side of the head and runs out carrying him like he weighed nothing."</p><p>"What you saw was another reason why joining with me is the right thing to do." Nabiki replied coolly. "Tatewaki is one of the few who could stand up to Hikaru and survive." She waved a hand at Ranma, Akane and Ukyo. "Meet three of the others who could say the same." Her smile became her usual shark-like one. "And they all listen to me." She turned from Kyoshi. "The old ghoul now knows about me which means she knows about the three of you." Nabiki paused then looked under the table. "You can come out now." Kimi stood. "You okay baby?" Nabiki asked Kimi.</p><p>"A little shaky but yeah." Kimi replied. "Sorry Nabs." Kimi said. "I panicked."</p><p>"With good reason." Akane said calmly. She gave Tatewaki an appraising look. "Okay, I'll cut you some slack." She informed the Kendoist. "You just better be good to my sister." She smiled wryly. "And Kimi."</p><p>"I will endevour to do my best." Tatewaki assured her.</p><p>"Nabs? Kimi?" Kyoshi questioned. "Nabs. Nabiki." His eyes widened as pieces of a puzzle clicked together. "No wonder you wanted Nerima." He said in understanding. "Nabiki Tendo." He snorted in amusement. He looked at Ranma standing with Akane and Ukyo on either side. "That would make you the Nerima Wrecking Crew."</p><p>"Not anymore." Ranma replied. "The Wrecking Crew is gone." He said. "Especially if Shampoo is on the other side."</p><p>"We're called the Terrible Three these days." Akane added with a slight smile. "I know, it sounds kind of dumb but there you go."</p><p>"I don't know Sis." Nabiki said cheerfully. "It suits you guys so well." She laughed when Akane stuck her tongue out at her. She turned back to Kyoshi. "I knew you'd figure it out eventually. You just did it earlier than I anticipated." She shook her head. "Who I am doesn't matter except where it counts." She waved an encompassing hand. "I have brains, money and muscle." She said. "And I have some damn good connections."</p><p>"Yeah and the girls and I hear some interestin stuff too." Ranma added. He grinned. "It's amazing what guys will say in front of a stripper." Ukyo chuckled as Akane just nodded knowingly. "Guy looks at a girl's tits and he forgets we have ears."</p><p>Kyoshi looked at Ranma askance. "Whatever." He returned his attention to Nabiki. He looked her in the eyes. Nabiki returned his stare steadily. Kyoshi grunted then bowed respectfully. "Ice Queen it is." He said as he straightened. "Now what?"</p><p>"Now?" Nabiki replied. "Now we start turning the heat up."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru Nakamura woke with a pounding headache. For a moment he was disoriented then his memory resurfaced. "Bitch." He shouted angrily. "I'll kill her."<p>"Ah son-in-law you're awake." Cologne hopped into the room on her staff.</p><p>"Where is that bitch of a grand daughter of yours?" Hikaru snarled. "Stupid bitch interfered in my fight."</p><p>"And probably saved your life by doing so." Cologne said mildly. "Or at the very least prevented you from being seriously injured." She hopped over to a chair and sat down. "You're too arrogant." She scolded. "You're talented Hikaru but your arrogance will be your undoing."</p><p>"Spare me the lecture." Hikaru growled. "Ow." He complained when Cologne hit him over the head with her staff. "That does it." Hikaru jumped out of the bed and launched a punch directly to Cologne's face. "Wha?" He exclaimed in disbelief when she stopped his punch with her index finger.</p><p>"Sit down and shut up." Cologne barked. "I allowed that attempt just to demonstrate how little you truly know." She pulled out her pipe. "As I said, you're talented but too arrogant." She filled her pipe. "Even Ranma was never that arrogant."</p><p>"I'm better than Ranma." Hikaru growled. "You even said so."</p><p>"I said you could be better that Ranma." Cologne replied waspishly. "Right now he still could take you and not breath hard." She puffed her pipe alight. "Even Tatewaki Kuno could hold you off." She blew a smoke ring. "I suspect Akane Tendo could do you serious harm." She turned at an amused snort from behind her. "You find that funny Shampoo?"</p><p>"Kitchen destroyer not beat Airen." Shampoo said in disdain. "She too weak."</p><p>"Once I would have agreed with you Granddaughter." Cologne replied. "But I have been hearing things. She's not the school girl you knew. And remember, she's been trained by Ranma."</p><p>"I no forget." Shampoo replied seriously. "But you train me." She looked at Hikaru. "If Great grandmother say you no ready, you no ready." She smiled at Hikaru's glare. "You still mad?" She asked. "We make up yes?"</p><p>"Fuck you bitch." Snarled Hikaru. "Ow." He rubbed his head. "Will you stop doing that you old ghoul?" He complained.</p><p>"Stop being an idiot." Cologne growled. "The woman you know as Mari is actually Nabiki Tendo."</p><p>"So?" Hikaru said disinterestedly. "I already knew that."</p><p>"So, it changes everything." Cologne narrowed her eyes in concentration. "Nabiki Tendo, Tatewaki Kuno and Ranma Saotome and his women; that's a formidable combination. Shampoo have you seen anything of Konatsu Kanzen or Ryu Kumon?"</p><p>"Konatsu protecting Ranma Mother." Shampoo reported crisply. "No one see Ryu Kumon in months."</p><p>"Hibiki?" Cologne asked.</p><p>"Last seen on pig farm." Shampoo replied. " Hibiki may not like Ranma but he no fight against him."</p><p>"Unfortunate." Cologne said musingly. "More unfortunate is that news of your failure will soon reach other ears."</p><p>"I didn't fail." Hikaru growled. "The bitch cold cocked me when I wasn't looking."</p><p>"Then we'll need to work on that blind spot." She stood up from the chair. "I must think on this." She said as she walked to the door. "We will speak in the morning." She walked away puffing her pipe and mumbling to herself.</p><p>Hikaru looked at Shampoo. "What are you still doing here bitch?" He snarled.</p><p>"Oh is Airen still mad?" She cooed. "That so, so silly." Shampoo undulated toward the gangster. "Why we not make up?" She reached Hikaru and leaned over and kissed him hungrily.</p><p>"Ow." Hikaru's hand flew to his mouth where Shampoo had just bit him hard. "Bitch." He backhanded Shampoo. Shampoo smiled and launched herself at Hikaru. She landed on top of him on the bed; her hands frantically started tearing at Hikaru's shirt. She ripped his shirt open and clawed at his bared chest with her hard nailed fingers. Red furrows appeared on Hikaru's skin.</p><p>Cologne looked up at the noises coming from Hikaru's room and cackled evilly. "Good girl." She said aloud. "Grab the balls and the man will follow." She cackled again.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Migami Moromoto looked up from her magazine as the door to her candy store opened. She frowned in both annoyance and fear as she saw who had entered. She went over to her cash register and opened it. Migami counted out twenty-five thousand yen and handed it to the smaller of the two men as they approached. Smaller was a relative term as the man was close to six feet and weighed a muscular one hundred ninety pounds. The man took the money and counted it. He shook his head. "You're short sweet cheeks."<p>"What do you mean short?" Demanded Megumi. "It's what we agreed to."</p><p>"We're changing the agreement." The man replied coldly. "Fifty thousand." He held out his hand. "Now." The door to her store opened and an attractive, though diminutive, redheaded woman in, at most, her early twenties, dressed in black shorts and red t-shirt, walked in. She walked over to the counter. "Beat it girlie." The man said coldly.</p><p>"Hi." The young woman said cheerfully. "You can leave now." She said to the man. "This is no longer your territory."</p><p>The man reared back in astonishment. Then his eyes narrowed angrily. "Who are you to tell me this isn't my territory."</p><p>The redhead jabbed herself in the chest with her thumb. "Me." She chirped. "We're taking over."</p><p>"Look I don't know what kind of game you think you're playing." The man said in almost reasonable tones. "But you better run along before you get hurt."</p><p>The redhead placed her hands behind her back and smiled cutely up at the man. She widened her eyes. "Really?" She breathed in wonder. "Ooh I'm so scared." She giggled. "Maybe I should call for help." She waved and the door opened two more women entered, a short haired, attractive though muscular woman in a long blue wig, wearing shorts and a t-shirt and a taller, slim, beauty wearing a silver-blond wig also in shorts and a t-shirt. "Aoi. Sugoi, this man says he'll hurt me if I don't leave." The redhead said petulantly.</p><p>"Didn't you tell him this was no longer his territory?" The blue wigged girl scolded.</p><p>The redhead nodded vigorously. "I did. I did." She said in protest. She pointed to the shorter of the two men. "Just ask him."</p><p>"Well?" The blue haired girl demanded. "If Usagi told you to leave, why are you still here?"</p><p>"Now wait a minute." Said the, up till now silent, second man. "Something's not right here." He said in the voice of a man not used to thinking. "You're supposed to be afraid of us."</p><p>"We are?" Chorused the three girls. The three girls looked at each other and giggled. The redhead placed a finger over her lips thoughtfully. "No." She said. "I don't think so." The redhead's voice was suddenly predatory. "I don't think so at all." As one the three women spun around, their legs kicked high. Akane and Ukyo's legs took out the taller of the two. Ranma took out the other one. The two men crashed to the floor.</p><p>Akane leaned down and extracted the wallets from the two men. She smiled gleefully. "Musta been collection day." She said cheerfully. "Oh and look a little black book." She put the money she found in her bra and rifled through the book. She nodded. "Yep." Akane looked up at the stunned Migami Morimoto. "What were you paying them?" She asked.</p><p>"Th-they just raised it to fifty thousand yen." The woman stammered. "Every two weeks."</p><p>"You're in luck." Akane said. "We're having a new customer special. Fifteen thousand." She extracted a card from her shorts. "Every two weeks. Anyone bothers you, you call this number."</p><p>"Fifteen thousand?" Migami said in disbelief. "Why should?" She looked at the two unconscious men on the floor. "Deal." She said hurriedly.</p><p>"Good." Akane replied.</p><p>"Give her ten thousand back, Aoi." Ranma called as she lifted one of the thugs. "I saw her give that one twenty five thousand."</p><p>"Okay Usagi." Akane replied. She grinned at the stunned shopwoman. "By the way, I'm Aoi, that's Usagi." She pointed to a cheerfully waving Ukyo. "That's Sugoi." She pulled out a circular from her back pocket. "Think you can post this in the window?" She said. "We usually work Friday and Saturday nights." Akane waved. "Later."</p><p>"S-sure." Migami said. She looked at the circular. "The Kabuki?" She looked at the three women as they carried the thugs out of the door. "Bye." She called. Migami opened a drawer under the register and pulled out some transparent tape. She walked over to her window and carefully taped the flier to the window in a prominent corner.</p><p>Migami walked back behind the counter. She began to giggle. Then to laugh.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Lieutenant Chikato Noriudo leaned back in his chair. He chuckled as he scanned the latest arrest report. "Public nudity." He shook his head. "Again." He said.<p>"Yeah." Said one of the police man at a nearby desk. "It's a regular epidemic." He chuckled. "Twelve in the last month." He said. "Funny how they all end up on top of a water tower." He smiled in satisfaction. "Amazing how they all turned out to be known Yakusa thugs too."</p><p>"Isn't it though?" Noriudo replied. 'Nabiki is really starting to put the screws to Nakamura.' Chikato thought in satisfaction. "Maybe it's some sort of hazing for new members." Chikato said in a musing voice. "What do our perps say?"</p><p>Noriudo's fellow officer laughed. "Not a lot." He said. "If I didn't know better, I'd say they were embarrassed."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was a Friday night and the Kabuki was packed. The strip club had always been popular but never as popular as it had become recently. Most of the girls had done their sets and were mingling with the customers, getting the regulars to buy them drinks and, in a few cases, negotiating some additional services. The new management turned a blind eye to these exercises in free enterprise as long as customers were given what they negotiated. About the only change the new management had instituted that caused some dissent was the firm 'no drugs' policy. Those dancers who were most affected no longer worked at the club. Three women and a man entered the club and sat down at 'their' table.<p>Tatewaki Kuno smiled in appreciation as a server came over with a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket. The champagne was from Tatewaki's private stock and only served to Tatewaki and whoever was with him. Nabiki and Kimi were, of course, his usual companions. Today a third woman joined the group.</p><p>"Gods this brings me back." Gigi said cheerfully. "I started in a club just like this one." She laughed. "That was more years ago than I care to remember." She laughed again. "Never thought I'd own a club. Part own." She amended.</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "Same here." She replied. "Got to admit though, it's very profitable." The music suddenly changed to the driving beat of Will Smith's 'Getting Jiggy With it.' All around Nabiki the regulars started up a chant. "U.S.A., U.S.A." A spotlight illuminated the large stage. "U.S.A., U.S.A." The M.C. walked on to the stage.</p><p>"Good evening everyone." The M.C. said. He smiled at the packed house. "It's Friday night and from what I hear most of you know what that means." The chant of U.S.A. got louder. The M.C.'s smile became a leer. "Yep, you know." He said. "Well in that case, let's not waste anymore time. You know'em. You love'em. Here they are, Usagi, Sugoi and Aoi. U.S.A." The M.C. hurried off the stage.</p><p>The curtain opened. Ranma, Ukyo and Akane skipped out on to the stage to the accompaniment of applause. Ranma wore a red halter top with matching red shorts, Ukyo in silver-white and Akane in her trademark blue.</p><p>Gigi watched in critical appreciation as the three girls performed together. "Ooh nice." Gigi said as the girls danced. "I showed'em that move." She said in pleased recognition. She chuckled. "With the way the boys are rushing the stage I'm surprised a fight hasn't broken out." Gigi watched the show, nodding every so often. "I see why they're so popular." She said after a moment.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo danced together. Sometimes close, very close. Sometimes apart yet somehow they always seemed to be touching each other. At times their touches were gentle and caressing and at times, Gigi's eyes widened as Akane and Ukyo kneeled in front of Ranma, Ranma's hands grabbed both girls by the hair. Ranma seemed to enjoy dominating the two girls but not as much as Akane and Ukyo both seemed to enjoy being dominated by the petite redhead. The crowd seemed to enjoy the stage play as well. "Anyone have any change?" She asked. "I think the girls deserve a tip."</p><p>"Here." Tatewaki said. "Give them this." Tatewaki handed Gigi a large wad of bills. He wiped his forehead. "They've earned it." Tatewaki smiled when Kimi laid a hand on his knee. "Fear not my lady." Tatewaki said. "Though lovely, you are lovelier still."</p><p>"He's getting real smooth, isn't he Nabs?" Kimi laughed. "You're such a liar." She leaned closer to Tatewaki. "Keep saying things like that baby. Okay?"</p><p>Tatewaki looked down at Kimi.. He looked over to Nabiki and raised an eyebrow at her. Nabiki nodded firmly at Kimi. "Fortunately, my lady, that is an easy promise to keep." He smiled at Kimi's happy sigh. "I would go further as to suggest that the clientele of this establishment would readily agree."</p><p>Nabiki giggled. "Yep, very smooth." Nabiki agreed. Seeing Hikaru again had affected Kimi badly and Nabiki was damned if she would let that pass unanswered. Kimi had become nervous and tense and started having trouble sleeping. Nabiki only found out about it when she left the bedroom she was sharing with Tatewaki and found Kimi sitting in a chair wrapped in a blanket. She dragged the protesting Kimi into the bedroom and watched her until she fell asleep. It took some coaxing but eventually Nabiki learned that Kimi was having Satoh flashbacks brought on by the combination of Hikaru's return and the growing closeness between Nabiki and Tatewaki. Nabiki made sure to include Kimi more often with her and Tatewaki.</p><p>She even convinced Tatewaki to sleep just with Kimi for a couple nights. Tatewaki told her, the next day, how Kimi had cried and clung to him. 'You'll pay for that Hikaru.' She had told herself. She turned back to watch the performers. 'Damn my sister is hot.' She thought with a touch of jealousy. She idly scanned the patrons surrounding the stage. She shook her head in amazement as she saw men, and a couple women, she noted, virtually crawling over each other to get closer to the stage. "Gigi is right; how a fight doesn't break out, I'll never know." She muttered.</p><p>Gigi came back from the stage. "It's worse than a mosh pit over there." She said in cheerful complaint. She looked back at the stage where Ranma, Akane and Ukyo had gotten down to just their tiny, money stuffed, g-strings and high heels. The stage was littered with bills and more money was being waved. "For all that, they must be the most polite group of voyeurs I've ever seen." At that moment one patron, obviously drunk and overly excited by the dancing, jumped up on the stage and tried to grab Ukyo. The reason for the crowd's politeness was revealed as Ranma grabbed the drunk and tossed him back into the crowd. Despite the density of the crowd, somehow the drunken man landed on the floor without hitting anyone.</p><p>Finally, and to the accompaniment of a loud groan of disappointment from the crowd, the set ended and the three girls collected the last of their tips and left the stage. It was nearly a half hour later before Nabiki saw her sister and Ranma and Ukyo making their way toward the table.</p><p>"Gigi!" Ranma, Akane and Ukyo chorused in pleased tones as they approached. Akane picked the older woman up and spun her around. "Hey teach." Akane chirped. "Finally came to see your students perform, I see."</p><p>"You guys were great." Gigi said enthusiastically. "And you Ukyo." She shook her head. "Why you like dressing like a guy when you have a body like yours." She giggled. "Has Big Daddy broken any more hearts?" She asked teasingly. She giggled at Ukyo's blush. "Damn it's good to see you three again."</p><p>"Same here Gigi." Ranma replied cheerfully. "So, are you guys slumming or did you need to talk to us about something?"</p><p>"Just wanted to talk about a few things." Nabiki replied. "Kyoshi and Tokio have both accepted me as Oyabun, the others are still thinking about it but it's more for show than any real decision. They know their only chance to survive is to join with us. Especially now that Kyoshi and Tokio are on board." Nabiki smiled shark-like. "The reports I've been getting indicate Hikaru's about ready to explode. Between your efforts and ours," She waved an inclusive hand at Kimi and Tatewaki. "It's only a matter of time before he tries something."</p><p>Akane looked worriedly at Gigi. "Are you sure it's a good idea to be seen with us?" She asked.</p><p>Gigi smiled. "Don't worry about me; between my boyfriend and Chikato I think I'll be fine."</p><p>"Even so," Akane grumbled. "You call us immediately if anyone bothers you, okay?"</p><p>Gigi fished out her cell phone and held it up. "Got you on speed dial." She said seriously. "Momma didn't raise no fool. Don't worry kiddo, I got my eyes open."</p><p>Though she didn't look convinced Akane nodded in acceptance. She turned her attention back to her sister. "What do you think Hikaru will do next?" She asked.</p><p>Nabiki shrugged. "I'm more concerned about what the Old Ghoul will do than Hikaru." She said seriously. She rubbed the bridge of her nose. "Kyoshi's men are already training with Daddy and until Kasumi gets married she's living at home. She's safe." She smiled at Akane and Ranma's approving nods. "Even when she goes shopping, someone is with her."</p><p>"And we're staying with Tatewaki, twenty-four seven." Kimi added.</p><p>"I had the door and windows reinforced." Tatewaki said seriously. "Plus Sasuke is never far away." He raised a hand. "And no we haven't found Gos."</p><p>Ranma grimaced. "Well at least we haven't seen anymore pictures." She muttered. "You know what bothers me about the whole thing?" Ranma asked. "If it was blackmail then where is the demand for money?" Ranma ran her hand through her unbound red hair. "Maybe it wasn't blackmail at all." She said musingly. "Gos, if it is Gos, really doesn't need money." She sighed. "Never mind, we'll learn what it's all about once Gos is found." She looked at Nabiki. "And it's kinda secondary compared to Hikaru."</p><p>"I agree Saotome." Nabiki said. "In the meantime, keep pressing him. Don't give him any room to breath or think."
