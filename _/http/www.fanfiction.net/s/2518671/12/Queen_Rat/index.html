</div><p>Chapter 12</p><p>'Working Girls'</p><p>Nabiki was sitting in the small room of their apartment that they had set up as an office She was looking at a report she had gotten from the Tokyo Police department. She tapped the pencil she was holding against her lip. "Hey Kimi." Nabiki called. "It seems the drug supply has started up again."</p><p>"Figures." Kimi replied. She looked up from her computer screen. "It was only a matter of time before they figured out another way to distribute it." She turned in her chair. "Is there a focal point?"</p><p>Nabiki shrugged. "Not really, but it has to be coming in through the ports." Nabiki's expression turned sour. "The more I keep looking, the bigger it seems to be." Nabiki stood and started pacing. "We shut down the prison connection, though we still don't know which member of the prison board was involved. Yet the distribution has restarted." Nabiki kept pacing. "Kimi run the names through the computer. Is there anyone on the prison board who has a connection to either the shipping lines or the truckers?"</p><p>"I'm on it Nabs." Kimi turned back to the computer and started tapping some commands. "It's going to take a little time." She said when she was done. "I'm running a cross check against several databases." Kimi stretched her arms over her head. "What say we go out?" Kimi grinned. "We still have a date to keep."</p><p>Nabiki's grin matched Kimi's. "Let me finish with our personal business first." She said.</p><p>Since she and Kimi had set up shop nearly two months ago, Nabiki had started looking for business opportunities. The grub stake she had received from Noriudo allowed her to start, or restart, her investments. So far the return was minimal, by Nabiki's standards . Unfortunately Nabiki was constrained by two factors. One was to keep a low profile and the other was looking for investments that could serve to further her investigations. 'I wonder how Akane would react if she knew I was part owner of the Kabuki Room?' She thought. 'At least that way I have an excuse to visit.' Not that either Nabiki or Kimi had visited yet, but they now had a legitimate reason to do so.</p><p>"How are we doing?' Kimi asked in interest.</p><p>"Not too bad." Nabiki replied. "The video game arcade is doing the best." She gave Kimi an approving nod. "Good call on your part." Nabiki said. "So far no one seems to have decided that teenagers make good drug customers."</p><p>"Matter of time Nabs." Kimi replied confidently. "Let's do a run by there before we head out for the evening."</p><p>"Hey Kenji. I need some tokens." The teenaged boy said to the young man behind the counter.</p><p>Kenji took the bill the teenager gave him and returned a handful of game tokens. 'Running low on tokens.' Kenji noticed. 'Better collect some from the machines.' Kenji had been working at 'Happi's' for a couple months now. An easy job. All he had to do was sell tokens, mop the floors and bathroom and wait for the boss to come in every couple of hours to take the money to the bank. Recently the arcade had changed it's name and added a couple new and very popular games. New vending machines lined one wall. Even the sound system had been improved. Supposedly the boss had taken on a silent partner. Kenji never met him but business had increased since then.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hey kid. Give me some change." Kenji looked up. 'Whoa.' Kenji thought in awe. 'There is a kami-sama.' Standing before him were two beautiful women. They both had long blond hair, were tall and slim and had great bodies, in Kenji's opinion. One was taller than the other but the two women wore similar looking outfits, form fitting black slacks and a shiny blouse. Even their sunglasses were similar. They looked like they were dressed for an evening out. The shorter of the two handed a bill. "Two bottles of water and the change in tokens." She amplified.<p>"Right away." Kenji grabbed two bottles of water from the cooler behind him and walked over to the cash register. He handed the first blond the water bottles and the tokens. "You guys college students?' Kenji asked conversationally.</p><p>"Taking a break." The young woman replied. She gave Kenji a smile. Suddenly Kenji felt like he had been weighed and measured down to the change in his pocket. "What's the favorite game here?" She asked.</p><p>"Well everyone likes the new game." Kenji replied. "A fight game. Pretty good graphics, though some of the special abilities seem a little weird." He added. "I mean, what good is being able to change into a duck?" He said scornfully. "Though being able to pull an almost infinite amount of weapons from his robes is pretty cool."</p><p>The first blond's grin widened. "Sounds like fun." She said. "What's it called?"</p><p>"Wrecking Crew." Kenji replied. "It's in the back." The two women walked off. Kenji spent a few enjoyable moments watching them walk away.</p><p>"Business looks good Kimi." Nabiki said as they walked to the back of the arcade. Kimi nodded. The arcade was pleasantly busy as far as she was concerned. 'This'll be a good opportunity to see how badly Noburu is shorting us.' She thought. They reached the back of the store. Nabiki grinned widely. There was a group of people clustered around one machine. "I have got to play that." Nabiki said in an anticipatory tone. "I think I'd pick the Chinese amazon warrior. She looks tough."</p><p>One of the observers turned to Nabiki. "Good choice." The teenaged girl said. "She's killer with those melon-headed maces. Good strength, great agility, lots of special moves." The girl laughed. "Even the boys choose her character." She nodded toward the machine. "If you're going to play, you'd better put your token on the machine."</p><p>Nabiki looked at the machine and noticed a row of tokens lined up along a slight lip on the top of the machine. Nabiki nodded, walked over and placed two tokens in the row. She walked back to stand next to Kimi and watch the action. Nabiki and Kimi kept looking between the game and the rest of the arcade. Nabiki leaned over to Kimi. "Remind me to speak to Noboru tomorrow."</p><p>Kimi nodded. "Yeah, I think we need to look a little more closely at the books." She replied. "Got to admit, I don't think he's shorting us by more than ten, fifteen percent."</p><p>"Bet you I can get a twenty percent increase in our cut out of him." Nabiki said challengingly.</p><p>Kimi looked around the arcade before answering. "What odds?" She asked.</p><p>"Five to three." Nabiki immediately. "And only because it's you."</p><p>Kimi nodded. "Twenty five thousand yen says you can't do it." Kimi said. "One week."</p><p>"A week huh?" Nabiki tapped her lower lip. "One week." Nabiki said musingly. "Deal." She said finally. "Minimum of twenty percent increase in a week." Nabiki rubbed her hands together cheerfully. "I love a challenge."</p><p>'Bet she get's twenty-five percent.' Kimi told herself. 'It'll be worth a hell of a lot more than twenty five thousand yen.' Kimi smiled in anticipation. She looked around the arcade. Suddenly her eyes narrowed. One of the patrons of the arcade caught her eye. She watched him for a couple minutes. Kimi turned to Nabiki. "Guy in the expensive blue jacket, white shirt and black slacks." she said quietly.</p><p>Nabiki casually turned and looked. She quickly located the young man. She gave him a quick and appraising glance then turned back to Kimi. "I think a mouse is sniffing at our cheese." She said in satisfaction. "We'll look at the replay later." She said. "One thing about Noboru, he has a good security system." Nabiki smiled. "Ah." She rubbed her hands together again. "My turn."</p><p>Kenji looked up from the counter. The noise level from the back of the arcade suddenly increased. A teenage girl came running over to him. "Hey Kenji you gotta see this. There's this blond babe at Wrecking Crew. She's been on for an hour and has beaten everybody."</p><p>"An hour?" Kenji said. "That must be close to, what, eight straight games." Kenji ran over. "Oh shit," He said happily. "Someone is going for the record." Kenji got to the gamers just in time to see two gorgeous blonds high-fiving each other. A low groan came from the surrounding observers as that was followed up by the two blonds first hugging and then kissing each other with obvious enjoyment. Kenji was among the groaners. "Figures.' He thought mournfully. 'Why are the hottest chicks always lesbians?'</p><p>"I think it's my turn." Said a voice. Nabiki turned around. Her grin got a little wider. 'Well he may be a mouse sniffing at some cheese, but he's a damn good looking mouse.' Nabiki's smile became predatory. Nabiki waved the man over. "Bring it on." She said languidly.</p><p>"I'm Hikaru." The man said. Nabiki figured he was in his late twenties, with a face that started with a strong, yet somewhat narrow jaw and rose to a wide, intelligent forehead. His hair was obviously styled but Nabiki thought it looked good on  eyes, Nabiki noticed were slightly inset, giving him a introspective and brooding look. From the way his jacket hung Nabiki added muscular to her assessment.</p><p>"I'm Mari." Nabiki replied. She jerked a thumb at Kimi. "That's Su. We came together."</p><p>Kimi grinned. "Yeah, that's one way of putting it." She looked at Nabiki. "Last game Mari." She said. "I'm getting hungry." She looked at Hikaru as she said it.</p><p>Nabiki turned to Hikaru." Yeah, me too." She smiled. "You know a good place to eat around here?" She asked.</p><p>Hikaru smiled into Nabiki's eyes. "My favorite place is only a couple blocks from here." He said. "I would consider it a great honor if you'd allow me to take you both to dinner afterwards." He leaned a little closer. "I hope you like French."</p><p>Nabiki's smile widened. "My favorite." She said in a slightly husky voice. One eyebrow rose delicately. "You wouldn't be speaking of 'La Monde' would you? I believe it's only a block or two away. I've never been there, but I've heard wonderful things."</p><p>"Ah a fellow connoisseur." Hikaru replied. "Excellent." He put his token in the game slot. "Winner chooses the wine?"</p><p>"I have expensive tastes." Nabiki purred.</p><p>"So do I." Hikaru replied easily.</p><p>"In that case." Nabiki said and her expression became suddenly focused. "Let's play."</p><p>Kenji watched as the blond again picked the Amazon woman character, while the man she was playing picked a character with black hair and a pony tail. His expression changed to awe as the blond and the man played NWC the way it should be played. In Kenji's opinion anyway.</p><p>Nabiki won the first round but it wasn't as easy as it had been before. The second match was closer, unfortunately it was in Hikaru's favor. The third tie-breaker had been in swing for nearly five minutes now and it was threatening to go on for ten more. Kimi was going to shout herself hoarse rooting for Nabiki "That's right baby." Kimi said. "You got him now. Yeah! Good one."</p><p>Hikaru grunted in sympathy with the game character. He played valiantly for a minute longer but eventually Nabiki was victorious. Hikaru stood away from the machine with an amused smile. "Well I guess you pick the wine." He said. He offered his arm to Nabiki. "Let's go."</p><p>"Sounds like a plan." Kimi said. She took Hikaru's other arm. The three exited the game arcade. Kenji watched then leave. He shook his head sadly. "Some guys have all the luck."</p><p>Hikaru led Nabiki and Kimi to his car. A red, expensive looking sports car, a convertible. Kimi got into the back seat and stretched out as much as she could. She quickly made herself comfortable. Nabiki got into the passenger side. She pulled out a head scarf and quickly wrapped it around her hair. Nabiki waved her hand imperiously. Hikaru started the engine and drove them away. The didn't have to drive far, La Monde was literally no more than two blocks away. "We could have walked." Kimi said.</p><p>"Yeah, but you girls did say you were getting hungry. I can't have that." Hikaru pulled in front of the restaurant. A man came over as they exited the car. Hikaru tossed the keys to young man. "Put this somewhere where it wont get scratched." Hikaru said. He took a bill from his jacket and held it two fingered toward the valet. Hikaru put his hand on the valet's shoulder. "See this?" He showed the valet the bill. "It comes back the way you took it, I'll give you another." He shoved the bill into the valet's vest pocket.</p><p>"Don't worry sir." The valet said happily. He gave Hikaru a receipt. "Man I would love to own one of these. I'll take good care of it." The valet jumped into the front seat and drove off down the street.</p><p>Hikaru led them into the restaurant. Hikaru walked over the Maitre'd There was a brief whispered conversation and then a handshake. Nabiki noticed the Maitre'd didn't smile so much as he looked both smug and impressed. He bowed and waved them in.</p><p>Once seated, Hikaru picked up the wine list and handed it to Nabiki. "You did win the match." Hikaru said.</p><p>"I told you I have expensive tastes." Nabiki said in challenge. "Besides we haven't decided what we are eating." Nabiki gave Hikaru a smoldering glance. "For dinner."</p><p>"Order whatever you want." Hikaru said in an off hand manner.</p><p>"Lobster." Kimi said firmly. "I'll let the chef decide how to prepare it."</p><p>"I like how you think." Nabiki told Kimi. "I'll have the same." She looked at the wine list. "Something dry, not too sweet and properly chilled." She turned to Hikaru. "In my experience it is best to listen to the waiters suggestions before deciding."</p><p>Hikaru tilted his head in agreement. "Well I guess it will be lobster tonight." He casually called a waiter over. Hikaru quickly gave their dinner orders. Nabiki spent a few minutes in conversation with the waiter before deciding on the wine. "So far your tastes have matched with mine." Hikaru said cooly.</p><p>"You have very expensive tastes." Nabiki said in approval."I like that in a man." She said. Nabiki nodded toward Kimi. "We're worth it."</p><p>"I expect so." Hikaru replied in a pleased tone. The dinner arrived cutting off, at least temporarily, the conversation.</p><p>Hikaru, Nabiki found, was intelligent, well read and appallingly confident. 'Like Ranma at his cockiest.' Nabiki thought in comparison. Nabiki smiled in anticipation.</p><p>After dinner Hikaru drove Nabiki and Kimi back to their apartment. He found a spot close and opened the door to let Nabkii and Kimi out. Nabiki looked at Hikaru. "Dinner was very nice." She said cooly. "But we didn't have dessert."</p><p>Kenji smiled. "They didn't have what I wanted on the menu." His grin turned lazy. "Are you going to invite me in?" He asked.</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "You have very expensive taste." She said. She took Hikaru's arm and started walking toward the apartment.</p><p>Kimi took Hikaru's other arm. "We're a matched set lover." She said with a broad smile. "Think you can handle it?"</p><p>Hikaru laughed. "Damn but I like you two." He said. "The question should be; can you handle me?"</p><p>Nabiki smiled. "Ah a challenge." She said regally. "I do so love a challenge." They reached the apartment building. There was a set of outside stairs that led directly to each of the four floors and the roof of the apartment building. Kimi and Nabiki lived on the second floor.</p><p>Nabiki unlocked the front door of the apartment. "Make yourself at home." She said to Hikaru. "Drink?" She walked over to the refrigerator and opened it.</p><p>"Got any beer?" Hikaru asked. Nabiki walked over to him and handed Hikaru a bottle. "I hope this is appropriate for someone with such expensive tastes."</p><p>Hikaru looked at the bottle. He nodded. "This will do." He took a slug of beer and looked around. "A bit smaller than I expected from you." He commented.</p><p>"It serves our purposes." Nabiki replied easily. "I like to spend my money on more important things." She smiled in a slightly predatory manner. "Speaking of money. You're very good looking, lover, but we have bills to pay."</p><p>Hikaru laughed. "You don't bullshit do you Mari?" He took his wallet from his back pocket and then pulled out a small wad of bills. He tossed several large denomination bills on the coffee table. "Will this do?" Nabiki looked at the bills on the table but made no move to take them. Hikaru laughed again and tossed a couple more bills on the table.</p><p>Nabiki smiled. "Come with me lover." Nabiki said in a warm voice. "And get ready for a night you'll never forget."</p><p>Hikaru smiled and stood and let Nabiki lead him into the bedroom. Kimi strolled by the coffee table and raised an eyebrow at the bills laying there. She followed Nabiki and Hikaru into the bedroom. Nabiki was slowly unbuttoning Hikaru's shirt. 'Nice muscles.' She thought as Hikaru's chest was exposed. She noticed Hikaru was still holding his beer. She walked over and took the beer. "I'll get you another one later lover." Kimi said. She placed the beer on a table and walked back of to where Hikaru was just finished removing Nabiki's top. She kneeled down in front of Hikaru. "Now let's see if you live up to your reputation". She undid Hikaru's belt and unzipped his pants. She pulled his pants down taking the underwear with it.</p><p>Nabiki looked down. "Oh very nice lover." She said in pleased tones. "Let's get comfortable lover." She said. "Something tells me we're going to be at this for a long time."</p><p>End Chapter 12</p>
