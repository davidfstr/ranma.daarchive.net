</div>Queen Rat<p>Book 4</p><p>Behind the Veil</p><p>Kodachi walked into the club she mentally thought of as 'Ky's Cafe American' but everyone else just called it The Club. It was early afternoon and while there were a number of patrons either at the gaming tables or the bar, it was relatively empty. Not until later in the evening would the club really fill up. On a small stage near the bar a number of women were going through a dance routine.</p><p>While the club did provide women for those patrons that desired it, the club did not have strippers. 'I'll leave that for the Kabuki.' Kodachi thought. What the club did provide was entertainment of a different sort. "Erotic but tasteful." was Kodachi's maxim. Kodachi paused by the stage to observe. When the girls finished their rehearsal Kodachi applauded quietly.</p><p>"Excellent girls." Kodachi said in approval. "I believe our customers will be pleased." There was a happy chorus of 'thank you Ms. Kuno' from the women. She looked at the pretty brunette in the center. "Noriko, please see me after you change."</p><p>"Of course Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied. She turned to the rest of the dancers. "Everyone take a break." She ordered. "And remember, no private clients until after the second show." Noriko clapped her hands briskly in unconscious imitation of Kodachi. "Now go." She said.</p><p>Noriko turned and walked quickly toward the small dressing room. 'I'll shower afterwards.' She told herself. 'It won't do to keep Ms. Kuno waiting.' She thought. Instead she wiped herself down with a damp cloth before putting on a plain skirt and blouse. In a very short time she was knocking on the office door. "It's Noriko." She announced then opened the door. "You wanted to see me Ms. Kuno?"</p><p>Kodachi leaned back in her chair and pointed to a chair on the other side of the desk. "Please sit Noriko." Kodachi waited until Noriko sat. "You've done well with the dancers." Kodachi began. "And I don't think the club would run as well without you."</p><p>"Ms. Kuno is too kind." Noriko replied quietly though it was difficult. She wanted to sing at receiving the praise but, 'It wouldn't do'. Ms. Kuno prized a controlled and quiet demeanor and Noriko did not want to disappoint. 'Not again.' She thought. Noriko gave Kodachi an alert look.</p><p>"No doubt." Kodachi said dryly. "But such competence should be rewarded." Kodachi raised her veil and looked into Noriko's eyes. "I wonder, how would you feel about taking over the management of the entire club?"</p><p>"Ms. Kuno." Gasped Noriko. She fought to control her expression. "I mean, I mean." Noriko gave in to her excitement. "Oh thank you Ms. Kuno." She exclaimed.</p><p>"Of course that would mean you would no longer be required to do any private entertaining." Kodachi added. "I think you should remove yourself from rotation." Kodachi had instituted a rotating schedule for the working girls where no girl worked more than any three days in succession. "But that would leave a gap."</p><p>Noriko frowned slightly in disappointment. "But Ms. Kuno, I, I have regulars and well," She sighed. "I can't believe I'm saying this." She said under her breath. "Can I at least keep my regulars?" She asked.</p><p>Kodachi laughed in real amusement. "I'm not that much of an ogre." Kodachi protested.</p><p>"Ogre?" Noriko said in sudden anger. "Who dared call you an ogre?" She said.</p><p>"Gently Noriko." Kodachi said soothingly. "No one called me an ogre." She shook her head. "What I meant to say was that of course you can keep your regulars, but you would no longer be on call."</p><p>Noriko sat back and took a deep breath. "Sorry Ms. Kuno." She said. "Thank you. I won't disappoint you." She promised.</p><p>"I doubt you are capable of disappointing anyone." Kodachi replied. "Now about the gap?"</p><p>"Well to be honest Ms. Kuno, we should have at least two extra girls." Noriko said in business like tones. "Business has increased in the past couple months and I suspect it will increase even further once we start the caberet." Noriko tapped her lower lip in thought. "We can't have just any girl here." Noriko said. "We do have standards to maintain." She said firmly.</p><p>"Of course." Kodachi agreed. "Well give it some thought and get back to me." Kodachi lowered her veil.</p><p>Noriko immediately stood. "Yes Ms. Kuno." Noriko bowed. "If you will excuse me Ms Kuno." Noriko turned and walked out of the office and then made her way to the girls ' dressing room. She was immediately approached by one of the women.</p><p>"Well, what did Ms. Kuno want?" Miki asked. "As if we didn't know." Miki grinned. "Ms. Kuno made you manager didn't she?" She laughed at the surprised expression on Noriko's face. "It's about time. You've been doing the job for months now."</p><p>Noriko found herself surrounded by the rest of the girls as they congratulated her. "Thanks guys." She said. "The only problem," She said after everyone had settled down. "Is now I need to find some new girls."</p><p>"My cousin Ami just moved into town." One woman said. Her name was Aoi, tall, slim with long blond hair she was an extremely popular girl. "I think she might give it a try." Aoi added. "I think."</p><p>Noriko raised an eyebrow. "You think?" She asked slowly. "Is the girl a pro or not?"</p><p>"Not." Aoi admitted. "But," She spread her hands. "The worst that could happen is she says no."</p><p>"Okay, if she's interested bring her in." Noriko said. "I'll talk to her." Noriko looked around. "Anyone else?" The girls thought then one by one shook their heads. Noriko blew out a breath of frustration. "I knew it wasn't going to be that easy."</p><p>"I never thought I'd work in a place where I had to worry about too much work." One of the other girls said. Noriko laughed along with the rest of the girls. Noriko stood. "Okay girls." She said. "Show time is in two hours."</p><p>"Two hours?" Aoi chirped playfully. "That's barely enough time to get ready." Laughing Noriko went to take her too long deferred shower.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"So this is Kodachi's place." Akane said. She looked around. "Not bad. Not bad at all." Akane was dressed in her Aoi persona. Blue nail polish, blue eye shadow, a blue dress, what there was of it, and her blue wig completed the look. She had one arm looped through the powerful and definitely male arm of Ranma Saotome. Ranma wore a light gray silk suit over a tieless black shirt. His free arm was across the shoulders of Ukyo as Sugoi and in a silver white dress that was as revealing as Akane's. Akane turned as a woman approached. "Hey Noriko." She said in greeting.<p>"Akane." She greeted the woman happily. She and Akane exchanged kisses on the cheek. "Ukyo. Ranma." Noriko kissed Ukyo's cheek. However Ranma grabbed her and kissed her full on the lips. "Yummm." Noriko said when Ranma released her.</p><p>"Slut." Akane and Ukyo chorused. Akane grinned. "We told Ranma to give you a good luck kiss from all of us."</p><p>"He delivered." Noriko said breathlessly. "Gods I'm glad you're here." Noriko said after she regained her composure.</p><p>"Opening night jitters?" Ukyo asked. She dimpled a smile. "Just remember, no matter what happens,"</p><p>"Smile." Akane and Ranma chorused.</p><p>"And why do we smile?" Ukyo's voice took on a chant like cadence.</p><p>"Smiles bring tips." Akane, Ranma and, giggling, Noriko joined in. Noriko sighed. "Thanks guys."</p><p>"Is Kodachi around?" Ranma asked. "The girls and I want to say hello."</p><p>"Ms. Kuno would be insulted if you didn't." Noriko said. "Come with me, I'll announce you."</p><p>"Anounce us." Akane said in an aside to Ranma. "I like that." They followed Noriko to at the very back of the club. She knocked then opened the door.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno. You have visitors." Noriko said.</p><p>Kodachi looked up from something she was reading. She smiled behind her veil. "Ranma." She said in pleased greeting. "Akane. Ukyo." She stood and came out from behind her desk. They greeted each other with kisses on the cheek and a brief hug. She waved to a conversation nook along one side of the office. "Sit." She said. "Drinks?" Her guests nodded. "Noriko."</p><p>"Of course Ms. Kuno." Noriko said. "Your usuals or would you like some of the '98?"</p><p>"Usual." Ranma said.</p><p>"98." Both Akane and Ukyo requested. Noriko nodded and went to the bar. She returned quickly holding a drink laden tray. She served Kodachi first before serving the rest of the guests. "If you'll excuse me, I have to get ready."</p><p>"Of course Noriko." Kodachi replied. "I believe the expression is 'break a leg?" After similar comments from Akane, Ranma and Ukyo, Noriko left. Kodachi watched her go. "I don't believe this club would run half as well without her." Kodachi commented.</p><p>"The girl works hard." Agreed Ranma. "So do you." Ranma reached into his jacket pocket. "A token of appreciation from the Ice Queen." Ranma placed a fat envelope on the coffee table. "She knows you don't need it but asks that you find some use for it."</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "I'm sure I can find something appropriate." She sipped her wine. "I'll thank her the next time I see her." Kodachi placed the glass on the table. "I still have some things to do." She said. "May I suggest trying the tables, would a one million yen line be sufficient?"</p><p>"More than enough." Ranma stood. "Come on girls." Akane and Ukyo stood and flanked Ranma. "Later Kodachi." With a polite bow they walked out of Kodachi's office and carried their drinks into the the main part of the club. They wandered over to the gaming tables. "Pai Gow or Blackjack?" He asked Akane.</p><p>"Blackjack." Akane said decisively. "I feel lucky." Laughing Ranma and Ukyo followed Akane to a table. "Gimme some chips." She told the dealer. Wordlessly the dealer passed over a large number of chips.</p><p>"Don't get carried away Tomboy." Ranma chided cheerfully. "I don't wanna miss the show." He turned to Ukyo. "We're gonna have to pull her away, ain't we?" Ukyo nodded. "Thought so." Ranma smiled. "Just as long as she's havin fun."</p><p>Ukyo looked at Ranma and smiled in agreement. She looked at Akane. 'Keep smiling baby. Maybe you'll fool yourself.' Ukyo thought.</p><p>Ukyo knew, despite outward evidence to the contrary, Akane still was hurting inside. Twice since they had defeated Hikaru the second time, Akane had tried going into the Soul of Ice and twice when she exited the psychic pain was still almost too much for the dark haired girl to bear. Ukyo grimaced. 'At least she can get into the Soul of Ice.' She thought in mild annoyance. Ukyo was close but even using the packets of magic water and becoming male didn't seem to allow her to find the 'balance' that both Akane and Ranma spoke about. Ukyo put a smile on her face. 'Worry about it later Ukyo old girl, tonight I want to party.' Ukyo laughed.</p><p>"Uk-chan?" Ranma asked curiously.</p><p>"Just getting in the mood Ran-chan." Ukyo chirped."Just getting in the mood."</p><p>"Blackjack." Squealed Akane excitedly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki opened the front door of the apartment. Since the engagement party, she, Kimi and Tatewaki had moved back into their penthouse apartment. Much as she enjoyed being waited on hand and foot by the Kuno staff, Nabiki did prize her privacy. The security system in this building helped ensure that privacy. She already knew who was at the door. "Chikato." Nabiki said in pleased tones. She took his arm and led him into the apartment. "Congratulations on your promotion; Captain." Nabiki escorted the policeman to a comfortable chair. "Please sit."<p>"Thank you Lady Kuno." Chikato replied.</p><p>"Now Chikato, you know you, of all people, can call me Nabiki." Nabiki chided.</p><p>"Hey Chikato." Kimi called from the wet bar. "Beer?"</p><p>"Please." Chikato Noriudo was, if anything, craggier than ever. His face as leathery as an old pair of boots. His close cropped hair a steel gray. "Where's Lord Kuno?" He asked.</p><p>"On the roof. Training." Nabiki replied."He'll be down when he finishes." She sat on the couch opposite the police captain.</p><p>"You don't interrupt a martial artist of Tatewaki's level." Kimi added seriously. "You have no idea how much that boy trains." She handed a bottle to Chikato and handed Nabiki a bottle of water. Kimi sat down next to Nabiki and curled her legs under her. "It's good to see you Chikato. Let me add my congratulations as well."</p><p>"Thank you Kimi." The captain took a healthy slug of his beer. His mouth curled into an unaccustomed and satisfied smile.</p><p>"Pray don't get up. You look much too comfortable." Tatewaki strode into the room in his swordsman's clothing, a towel was slung across his shoulders. His hair was wet and plastered against his skull. "Forgive my appearance but I know your time is valuable." He walked over to the bar and grabbed a bottle of water and walked over to the couch and sat between Kimi and Nabiki. "Congratulations on your promotion. Captain Noriudo."</p><p>"Thank you Lord Kuno." The new captain replied. The two men bowed respectfully to each other from their seated positions. "It's good to see you Tatewaki." Chikato said as he sat back up.</p><p>"You too Chikato." Tatewaki replied. "We don't see enough of you."</p><p>Chikato shrugged. "You know how it is, it isn't a good idea for me to be seen in the company of the Ice Queen too frequently." He gave Nabiki an apologetic look. "Sorry, but that's the truth."</p><p>"Don't apologize Chikato." Nabiki said easily. "We do understand." She rose. "Excuse me for a second." Nabiki walked over to a shelf and picked up a box about the size and shape of a shoe box though made of rich woods and inlaid with ivory. "I almost forgot to give you your promotion present." She placed the box in front of Chikato. "A small token of our appreciation."</p><p>Chikato opened the box and looked inside. There was a small jade figurine nestled on a bed of silk. 'Too large for such a small item. Even one this expensive..' Chikato reached in and lifted the edge of the silk to see the edge of a brick of large denomination yen. "I could arrest you for attempting to bribe a police officer." He said conversationally.</p><p>"What bribe Captain?" Nabiki said easily. "If it makes you feel better give it to the policemen's orphans fund or something equally useful." Nabiki sipped her drink. "My operations would not, could not, run as well without your influence. I've grown wealthy because of you Chikato. Equal risks deserve equal rewards, don't you think?" She nodded at the box. "That is just a token of what is due you." Nabiki leaned forward. "You don't have to take it but it will always be there."</p><p>"My accountants have already been instructed to provide you with an annuity if you do not accept what is yours." Tatewaki rumbled pleasantly. "One way or another our debt to you will be paid." Tatewaki sipped from his water bottle. "Sometimes it is best to give in to the inevitable." Tatewaki smiled slightly and leaned forward. "You're an honest man Captain but more importantly you're a patriot." He said seriously though with the same slight smile on his face. " Japan needs men like you, men willing to do what is necessary for the good of our country. As you have done with us." He nodded toward the box. "Unfortunately your good deeds will, hopefully and necessarily, remain unsung but we," His hand waved to include Nabiki and Kimi, "could never in good conscience let it remain unrewarded." Nabiki and Kimi nodded somberly.</p><p>Chikato was silent throughout Tatewaki's speech. Finally he nodded though reluctantly. "I have to admit I could use the money." He said.</p><p>"Excellent." Nabiki smiled. "Let's not speak of it anymore." She looked at the bottle in the Captain's hand. "That looks empty. Can I get you another?"</p><p>"One more and then I must go." Chikato replied. He placed the box carefully on his lap.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The hot sound of the Pussycat Dolls singing 'Doncha' thumped out of the speakers as the dancers gyrated in time to the music. Noriko danced out in front.<p>Ranma with Akane and Ukyo sitting on either side, sat at a table near the edge of the small stage. Sitting next to them and watching the stage show was a familiar and attractive woman in her mid forties. Gigi had, to everyone's delight, accepted an invitation to see the show. Sitting next to her was her oft mentioned but rarely seen boyfriend. Kojiro was a saturnine looking man in his late forties. He wore a silver gray silk suit that hung softly on his muscular frame and looked every inch the archetypal 'Big Daddy'.</p><p>Akane elbowed Ranma. "Stop staring at Kojiro." She hissed. "He's taken."</p><p>Ranma turned his head and smiled at Akane. "So'm I." He gave Akane a look that made her flush in anticipatory pleasure. "But you got to admit he's hot." Akane nodded quickly. Ranma grinned. He nodded toward the stage. "They're doin pretty good." He said in a more conversational tone.</p><p>"You guys did more than pretty good with the choreogaphy." Gigi said approvingly. "Dirty enough to be erotic but nothing you wouldn't see in a legitimate club."</p><p>"Akane deserves most of the credit for the choreography." Ukyo gave Akane an admiring look. "She does our choreography too."</p><p>"Well I had a good teacher." Akane said in slightly embarrassed tones. "I only know what you taught me Gigi."</p><p>Gigi smiled and leaned over. "Don't sell yourself short kiddo, you done good." Akane ducked her head in pleased embarassment.</p><p>Ranma sat back and his shoulders were immediately claimed by Akane and Ukyo. "Just like old times, hey guys?"</p><p>"Yeah." Akane said happily. Ukyo just snuggled closer to Ranma. Akane looked at Ranma. 'So'm I, he said. He was looking at me when he said it too.' Akane thought. She sighed and snuggled up closer to Ranma.</p><p>Kojiro leaned closer to Gigi. "He really is Ranko?" He looked over his shoulder at Ranma and the two girls. Kojiro had met Ranko, once, during training. He had also met Ranma, once, during training. Despite Gigi's assurances Kojiro was not convinced. He turned again at Ranma's snicker.</p><p>"I can always tell when someone is talking about me." Ranma lifted just his hands from the shoulders of Akane and Ukyo in a shrug. For the first time Kojiro noticed that Ranma's fingernails were manicured and polished a bright red. "If you think it's weird try being me." Ranma's right hand made a throw away motion. "I'll show ya another time but it's true."</p><p>"Oh yeah." Akane and Ukyo chorused. They even sighed happily in unison.</p><p>Kojiro snorted in amusement. "No need to ask what your secret is." He commented. "Do you realize how much you could make as an escort?"</p><p>"Oh, I'd say, what was the last offer I got?" Ranma mused. "Five hundred thousand yen for one evening, both forms." Ranma smirked. "I don't mind doin a lap dance or two, but I make enough doing what I'm doing." He chuckled. "Not to mention the Tomboy and Uk-chan would get pissed."</p><p>Ukyo and Akane raised their heads off Ranma's shoulders, looked at each other and blinked. "Thank you Ranma." Akane said. "But we know you'd have a good reason, I don't think we'd be mad." She and Ukyo lay their heads back on Ranma's shoulders. "Whatever you want, remember?"</p><p>"Damn it just gets harder and harder to get a rise out of either of you." Ranma said approvingly. "Good." Akane and Ukyo smiled contentedly. Ranma turned his attention back to Kojiro. "Like I said; I make enough."</p><p>Kojiro chuckled and would have continued the conversation but was hushed by Gigi. "You boys can talk later." She said scoldingly. "I want to watch the show."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi watched the performance from her private booth. 'I think they're doing very well Ky.' Kodachi thought to herself. 'Noriko certainly has thrown herself into dancing.' She smiled. 'Along with the rest of her duties.' Her thoughts went back to the engagement party. 'I wonder if Ranma was serious or just trying to distract me.' Kodachi watched a little longer. 'Well her balance is good. She needs to stretch more though.' Kodachi critiqued Noriko's movements. 'Forgive me Ky, but I think I'm going to try.' Her hand went to the bullet that hung between her breasts.<p>Kodachi applauded along with the rest of the clientelle. She smiled as she observed a renewed surge of men heading toward the upstairs rooms with one, or more, of her girls. 'Excellent.' She thought. 'Noriko was right Ky.' She thought a moment later. 'We're going to need more girls. I can't have them dance and entertain gentlemen, not for long anyway.' Kodachi sighed.</p><p>"Is everything all right Ms. Kuno?" Came a voice. Kodachi turned. "Oh Miki." Kodachi made a dismissive gesture with her hand. "Just the normal worries." She said. Kodachi nodded toward where another girl was leading a man toward the private rooms. "I don't think we've ever been this busy." Miki nodded in cheerful agreement. "Do you like working here Miki?" Kodachi asked. Miki's nod became more vigorous. "Excellent."</p><p>Kodachi stood. "Well I must get back to work." She said. "Please ask Noriko to see me after her second set." She told Miki. Kodachi walked to the office door and went inside.</p><p>Miki watched as Kodachi entered her office. "Of course Ms. Kuno." She murmured. Miki saw a man at the end of the bar. "I think someone is looking for company." She walked over. "Hi, I'm Miki." She said cheerfully. "Hey you're cute."</p><p>Kodachi went to her desk and busied herself reading reports. Appearances to the contrary, this club was not all or even the most profitable of Ky's holdings. Nor was it the only place where there was prostitution or gambling. First under Ky's leadership and now Kodachi's, the Yakusa presence in her territory had returned to it's more traditional mode of operations. Gambling, prostitution, smuggling were still practiced but with a renewed crackdown on drugs and guns.</p><p>There was grumbling by some of the rank and file at first but then along with increased profits a suddenly acquired respect from the public swayed them. In a short time Kodachi's hold on Ky's operations was solidified. 'With the actions of Ranma and Ting Li's teams violent crime and robbery are down but there is still much to do.' She thought. 'Another team would help tremendously.' Kodachi continued working and didn't stop until a knock on her office door made her look up. "Come in." She said. The door opened and Noriko entered.</p><p>"You wanted to see me ." Asked Noriko.</p><p>"Please have a seat Noriko." Kodachi waved to the chair in front of the desk. She sat back. "I was impressed by the performance." Kodachi said when Noriko had seated herself.</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied with a touch of relief in her voice.</p><p>"Still, I feel dancing may not be the best use of your talents." Kodachi continued. "I was wondering if you'd be willing to undertake a more difficult challenge."</p><p>"Challenge Ms. Kuno?" Noriko said cautiously.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "I want you to come to the mansion tomorrow night and be prepared to stay the weekend." Kodachi said. "We will discuss this new challenge then." Kodachi leaned forward. "And determine if you are capable of meeting it." She said.</p><p>"I will do my best Ms. Kuno." Noriko said seriously.</p><p>Kodachi raised her veil. To Noriko's surprise Kodachi was smiling slightly. "I expect nothing less from you Noriko." Kodachi lowered her veil.</p><p>Noriko stood. "Thank you Ms. Kuno." She said. "If you will excuse me." She bowed and walked out of the office. Noriko looked around and then headed toward the bar. "Miki it looks like your understudy days are over. Starting tomorrow you will dancing in the cabaret."</p><p>Miki's eyes widened. "Dancing? Me?" She looked at Noriko in concern. "Ms. Kuno wasn't displeased was she?" She relaxed when Noriko shook her head. "Then why?"</p><p>"Ms. Kuno has something she wants me to do." Noriko explained. "Something difficult." She said. "The good news is that I'm spending the weekend at the Kuno mansion." Noriko frowned slightly. "The bad news is that I'm going to have to cancel a couple dates." She chuckled sourly. "If this keeps up I'm going to become celibate."</p><p>"Why don't you just tell Ms. Kuno you can't make it this weekend?" Miki asked. She rolled her eyes at the expression on Noriko's face. "Forget I said anything." She pursed her lips. "Want me to take over your appointments for this weekend?"</p><p>Noriko sighed. "No, thanks, but no." Noriko said. "They're both pretty easy going so I can just reschedule." She frowned. "It's just that I was looking forward to getting laid." She complained. "Don't laugh." She said at Miki's giggle. "It's been over a week."</p><p>Miki sobered instantly. "That's not good." She looked at Noriko curiously. "So what does Ms. Kuno have planned for you this weekend?" Suddenly Miki giggled.</p><p>"What?" Said Noriko.</p><p>"You know, if Ms Kuno was a guy I might be a tiny bit suspicious." Miki giggled again.</p><p>"Miki." Noriko said in an amused though admonishing tone. "This is Ms. Kuno we're talking about." She waved a hand in surrender. "I wish she would find somebody though." Noriko sighed. "But who could replace Ky for her?"</p><p>"Yeah." Agreed Miki. "Well call me when you get back." She said. "Okay?"</p><p>"Okay." Noriko promised. With a wave she went into the back to shower and change. Truth be told it had been a long day and she was tired. Unfortunately her expected departure was delayed when Aoi walked in with a young woman. "Let me guess, this is your cousin." Noriko appraised the young woman.</p><p>Aoi nodded. "I called her and she came over." She explained. "Noriko let me introduce my cousin, Ami."</p><p>Ami bowed respectfully. She was pretty, with a heart shaped face, dark hair, slim hipped and small breasted. Her short skirt showed a lot of shapely legs. The door to the dressing room opened and Kodachi walked in. "Oh Noriko, I'm glad you're still here. I forgot to tell you to bring clothing suitable for heavy exercise." She noticed the newcomer. "Who is this?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Ms Kuno this is my cousin Ami." Aoi said in a hurried introduction. "Bow." She hissed out of the side of her mouth. "Deeply." She added in the same hiss. "This club belongs to Ms. Kuno." She told her cousin.</p><p>Ami bowed deeply. "An honor, Aoi talks about you all the time." Ami said in a pleasant soprano.</p><p>"Indeed." Kodachi replied. She smiled slightly behind the veil. Kodachi walked slowly over to Ami then started to walk slowly around the young woman. "Age?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Nineteen." Ami replied.</p><p>"Nineteen Ms. Kuno." Aoi hissed. "Please excuse her," Began Aoi but a wave of Kodachi's hand made her stop.</p><p>"It is not required." Kodachi said calmly.</p><p>Ami bowed hurriedly. "I apologize Ms. Kuno." Ami said quickly. "Aoi is right I was being disrespectful."</p><p>"I'm beginning to like this girl." Noriko murmured.</p><p>Kodachi nodded slightly. "Experience?" She continued to circle Ami. The girl seemed calm despite the circumstance.</p><p>"Experience?" Ami replied. "Ms. Kuno?" She added quickly.</p><p>"You do know what is expected don't you?" Kodachi asked seriously. "This is a gentlemen's club." She explained. "I cater to their need," Kodachi smiled behind her veil. "To play." She added.</p><p>Ami smiled slightly. "And I'm a toy?" She asked impishly. "I kind of figured that Ms Kuno." Ami said easily. "It's not like I don't know how Aoi makes a living." She shrugged. "This has got to be better than working in an office." She said. "Ms. Kuno." She shook her head. "I'm not a virgin if that's what you're asking. I like sex; would be nice to get paid too."</p><p>"That's not all one of Ms Kuno's girls do around here." Noriko said seriously. "We don't hustle." She said. "We entertain."</p><p>"Entertain?" Ami said questioningly.</p><p>"Cuz, a guy'll give you a tip just for being nice to him." Aoi said with a smile. "Do not underestimate the power of the GFE."</p><p>"GFE?" Ami asked.</p><p>"The Girl Friend Experience. GFE." Aoi explained. "Isn't that right Ms. Kuno?"</p><p>Kodachi smiled again behind her veil. She nodded. "It is indeed Aoi." Kodachi continued her circle. "Most of the men who may avail themselves of your services are not so much seeking sex as they are companionship, it is up to you to provide that companionship. As Aoi has mentioned, successfully providing even a light GFE will translate to tips."</p><p>Kodachi stopped in front of Ami. "We offer our clientelle a wide range of experiences but I do not countenance hard drugs. For either my clientelle or my girls. Is that understood?" Kodachi continued her circle. "I don't mind you smoking Marijuana but only after hours not while on duty. And never before work."</p><p>Ami nodded again. "Yes Ms Kuno." She replied. "If you don't mind my saying Ms Kuno I'm surprised you said that."</p><p>"Considering how harmless it is in comparison to what is allowed, it would be hypocritical of me to abide by that law when I break so many others." Kodachi said cooly. "I've done my own small research on the subject." Kodachi, an accomplished botanist, said modestly. "If you're so inclined ask our physician." Ami nodded.</p><p>"There are some very important people who come here, if they demand something you are unable or unwilling to provide, see Noriko or myself immediately. Is that understood?" Ami nodded once again. "If you work here, you will see the physician at least once a month or immediately if you're even slightly suspicious something might be amiss. Is that understood?"</p><p>Ami nodded. "Yes Ms Kuno."</p><p>"I'll arrange an appointment with Dr. Ono." Noriko said. "That's our physician." She pulled out an appointment book and quickly made an entry.</p><p>Kodachi nodded approvingly. "The house gets five thousand yen for each hour of private entertaining ." Kodachi continued. "Is that understood?"</p><p>Ami frowned. "Five thousand yen, Ms. Kuno?" She asked. "That seems a lot."</p><p>"If you aren't getting twenty-five thousand yen or better for an hour of your time, then something is wrong." Noriko said. "Anyone offering less should be directed to," Noriko paused. "Somewhere else." She said. "I will provide you with a list of lesser locations."</p><p>"What if a client wants company overnight or for dinner or something?" Ami asked. "Is that allowed?"</p><p>"Allowed and even encouraged. The house will get fifteen thousand yen on all such appointments, especially if it results in you missing an evening's work." Kodachi tilted her head. "You're pretty enough, and with Aoi's recommendation I am inclined to give you a try." She turned to the other woman. "Aoi, please show your cousin around."</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." Aoi and Ami chorused. With a bow they walked away though they started giggling before they went even ten steps.</p><p>"Well that's one." Noriko observed. "We still need at least one more." She looked at Kodachi. "Heavy exercise?" She asked.</p><p>Kodachi lifted her veil. "If you had the opportunity what would you have done to Toshio Wasamura?" She asked.</p><p>"Ripped his balls off and fed them to him." Noriko said angrily. She flushed. "Excuse my language Ms. Kuno." She said apologetically. Kodachi smiled grimly and waved off the apology. "It wasn't right." Noriko said firmly.</p><p>Kodachi lowered her veil. "I agree." Kodachi said. "I will see you this weekend."</p><p>End Chapter 1</p><p>Author's notes: Miss me?</p>
