</div><p>Queen Rat Book 2</p><p>'Power Play'</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>'Rumors'</p><p>Akane looked up at the sound of the doorbell. 'Who could that be this early?' She thought. She stood. "I got it." She called to Ranma's closed door. She snorted. 'Like they're even awake.' She walked quickly to the door. "Who is it?' She asked.</p><p>"Akane?" Came a familiar voice. Akane's eyes widened and she pulled open the door.</p><p>"Kasumi?" She said in surprise. "What are you doing here?" She asked. "Is everything all right at home?"</p><p>"We're fine." Kasumi replied. She gave Akane a searching look. "It's," Kasumi took a deep breath. "Have you heard from Nabiki?"</p><p>Akane led Kasumi over to the small couch. "Sit." She said. She walked into the kitchen and poured a cup of tea for Kasumi and placed it on the coffee table in front of her sister. "Nabs?" Akane shrugged. "I spoke to her on the phone last week. Why?"</p><p>"There's this horrible rumor going around." Kasumi said. Kasumi's tone may have been mild but Akane could hear the anger in it. "They said. They say. Oh, I can't even bring myself to repeat it."</p><p>"Slow down Sis." Akane said soothingly. "What have you heard?"</p><p>Kasumi took a sip of her tea. "Why would anyone make up such horrible stories about Nabiki?" Kasumi complained. "I know she did a lot of not so nice things to get money but I," She broke off. "If anyone would know you would." She said.</p><p>"You're not making sense Sis." Akane said firmly. 'What are people saying?"</p><p>"Nabiki and men." Kasumi whispered. "For money." Kasumi looked up sharply when Akane didn't say anything. "No." She gasped. "It can't be."</p><p>Akane raised her hand soothingly. "It's an exaggeration." Akane said quickly. "Nabiki was only pretending. You know, as part of her cover." Akane patted Kasumi's hand. "You know Nabiki would never do anything like that. Not really."</p><p>"Why don't I feel reassured?" Kasumi asked. "What does 'not really' mean?"</p><p>"It means 'not really'." Akane replied firmly. "Listen to me Sis. Next time you hear that rumor you tell that person that they have no idea what they are talking about." Akane was about to say something more when the door to Ranma's room opened and a yawning Ukyo walked out. Ukyo's eyes widened when she saw Kasumi. She turned.</p><p>"Hey Ran-chan get out of bed." Ukyo called back into the bedroom. "You won't believe who's here." Ukyo turned and waved to Kasumi. "I'll be right back. I got to wash up." Ukyo hurried to the other bedroom. She emerged a minute later wrapped in a towel.</p><p>"Kasumi!" Ranma rushed over to Kasumi and picked her up. "Damn it's good to see ya." He swung Kasumi around a couple times before depositing her gently back in her chair. "Let me wash up." He raced back to his room and then to the bathroom.</p><p>"But. But.," Kasumi stammered. "Ukyo is in there." She looked at Akane. "Did Ukyo just walk out of Ranma's room?" She squeaked. "Please just tell me she was in there to wake him up." Her eyes widened in shock when Akane shook her head. "Akane!" She exclaimed. "I think I'm worrying about the wrong sister." She muttered under her breath.</p><p>"Long story sis." Akane said sourly. "The short explanation is; I screwed up." Akane sighed. "It's not so bad. Ukyo doesn't take advantage of it too much and I'm still in Ranma's life."</p><p>"You mean you're sharing him?" Kasumi said in disbelief. "With Ukyo? Here?" She put her hands on her hips. "You don't have to put up with that." She said. "I don't care what you did; you don't deserve being humiliated like that."</p><p>"Want to bet?" Akane said quietly. "Ranma," Akane sighed. "Ranma is nicer than either Ukyo or I deserve." She raised her hand. "Let it go Sis. Please."</p><p>"How can you expect me to let it go?" Kasumi asked. "I think I deserve an explanation."</p><p>Akane nodded. "Later. Okay?" Akane stood and walked into the small kitchen. She emerged a little later carrying two more mugs. She placed them on the table just as Ukyo and Ranma emerged from the bathroom. Ukyo grabbed her mug and walked into the smaller bedroom. Ranma wrapped in a towel walked over to Akane, kissed her on the cheek, grabbed his mug and walked into his bedroom. Ranma and Ukyo emerged, dressed, from their respective bedrooms a minute later.</p><p>Ranma walked over to the table and sat down next to Akane. Ukyo leaned against the wall close by. Ukyo, Kasumi observed, was dressed more or less in the androgynous manner she had come to expect from the chef. Ranma was in male form and dressed in a comfortable looking pair of slacks and pullover. After a moment Kasumi realized that both Ukyo and Ranma had dressed in colors that matched what Akane was wearing. To Kasumi it was less the cutsyness of some couples as it was more like members of the same school wearing their team's colors. Or a gang.</p><p>"Someone's been spreading rumors about Nabiki." Akane said after everyone was settled. "That's why Kasumi's here." Akane explained. "I told her it was crap."</p><p>"Akane. Language." Exclaimed a scandalized Kasumi.</p><p>"Oh grow up Sis." Akane said in annoyance. "I've heard a lot worse." She shook her head. "Sorry, I'm kind of irritable in the morning." Akane smiled slightly when Ranma put his arm around her shoulders. Akane leaned against him.</p><p>"But why would someone make up such a story?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Because it would be easily believed, for one." Ukyo commented. Ukyo took a sip from her mug. "The question is; is this a personal attack or related to the Satoh job?" She shrugged. "We'll let Nabiki know regardless." She looked at Kasumi. "How come you didn't go directly to Nabiki?"</p><p>Kasumi sighed. "I don't know. Maybe I was afraid it was true." She looked at Ukyo. "As you said; it would easily be believed."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki opened the door to her apartment. "Tatewaki." Nabiki said in a pleased tone. "I was so happy to hear from you." She said. "Come on in."<p>Tatewaki Kuno entered the apartment. "Thank you." He said. "Though unfortunately I am not here on pleasure." Tatewaki sighed. "We must talk." He said. "Nabiki Tendo."</p><p>Nabiki's head jerked back in astonishment a denial came to her lips. The look on Tatewaki's face stopped her. She sighed. "Why'd you have to spoil it?" She grumbled.</p><p>"If it were up to me, I would have happily kept on pretending." Tatewaki replied. "Before I say more, let me just say; thank you." His lips curled into a smile before returning to a more somber expression. "You and Su have been more than kind to me."</p><p>"Kimi." Nabiki said. "Her name is Kimi."</p><p>"Kimi then." Tatewaki agreed. "You both have been more than kind and as I said I would have been happy to keep pretending."</p><p>"Why? So you could laugh at the Ice Queen?" Nabiki said angrily.</p><p>"No. No." Protested Tatewaki. "Because you didn't laugh at me." Tatewaki spread his hands helplessly. "It's what most did. I was the class clown, was I not? No. Not to laugh. More like to cry since I expect you will no longer wish to see me. Still, out of gratitude I must tell you news that I fear you will find distressing." Nabiki looked at Tatewaki in astonishment.</p><p>"Hi Tatewaki." Kimi said as she came out of the bedroom. She stopped and looked at the expressions on Nabiki and Tatewaki's faces. "Who died?" She asked.</p><p>"Us apparently." Nabiki grumbled. "It seems our disguises were not as good as I thought." She jerked her chin at the couch. "Well sit down and tell us this news."</p><p>'There have," Tatewaki licked dry lips. "Foul and slanderous rumors have come to my ears about you." Tatewaki sighed. "They are calling you a prostitute." He looked at Nabiki. "I fear the stories have reached your father."</p><p>Nabiki paled. "Oh no." She moaned.</p><p>"I tried to quash the lies but none would listen to me." Tatewaki said sadly.</p><p>"Well they're not exactly lies Tatewaki." Kimi said in a resigned tone. "You've given us money." She reminded him.</p><p>"That was a game." Tatewaki declared. "A game we all willingly played." Tatewaki stood and started pacing. "Alright so it wasn't a game." He amended. "But it isn't the sordid piece they make it out to be." He stopped in front of Nabiki. "I apologize for being the bearer of such tidings but I thought it best you heard it from," Tatewaki paused. "Someone who cared." He said quietly. "I should go now. I've caused you enough distress." Tatewaki started toward the door.</p><p>"You sit down right now Tatewaki Kuno." Nabiki ordered. Kuno sat like he was folded. "That's better." She marched over and stood in front of Tatewaki. "You care huh?" Tatewaki nodded. "Since when?"</p><p>"Oh give him a break Nabs." Kimi scolded. "He could have just stopped seeing us. He didn't have to come here and tell us in person." She sat down next to Tatewaki. "Thank you for that."</p><p>Nabiki blew out a breath and sat down on Tatewaki's other side. "Sorry." She said. "I guess I'm not used to thinking of you as," Nabiki smiled helplessly. "A friend."</p><p>"Oh bullshit Nabiki." Kimi said. "You're just not used to admitting you like him." She turned to Tatewaki. "You knew the first night, didn't you?"</p><p>After a moments hesitation Tatewaki nodded. "Aye, though not until we returned here." Tatewaki, to Nabiki's amazement, blushed. "I confess I was not looking at your face that closely." Tatewaki ducked his head. "Only later, when you fell asleep, did I truly look at you. You are built much like your sister." Tatewaki sighed. "I would have happily gone on pretending, for your sake if not for mine." He looked at Nabiki. "I know not why you pretended but I knew it was pretense."</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "Oh? And how did you know that?"</p><p>"I think it was the 'Oh Tatewaki that feels so good' that gave it away." Cracked Kimi. "That and the moaning." Kimi grinned. "You're a good actress Nabs, but not that good." She turned to Tatewaki. "She couldn't wipe that smile off her face for days."</p><p>"Kimi!" Nabiki shrieked in outrage.</p><p>"Am I lying?" Kimi grinned. "Well am I?"</p><p>Nabiki glared at Kimi for a moment then finally lowered her eyes. She shook her head. "No."</p><p>"I may be a fool but I think I can recognize real passion when I experience it." Tatewaki said. The look he gave Nabiki was laced with more than a touch of confusion.</p><p>"You're no fool Tatewaki." Nabiki said. "I'm beginning to wonder if you ever were." She waved a negating hand. "Never mind." Nabiki took a breath. "Okay here's what happened; you heard about my arrest I assume." Tatewaki nodded. "We were given a deal to get a pardon. I can't tell you what but," She waved a hand at Kimi. "Kimi and I used being escorts as our cover."</p><p>"Now that I can believe." Tatewaki said after a moment. "And me?"</p><p>Nabiki's mouth twisted wryly. "You were a test run." Nabiki glared at Kimi's snort of laughter. "Okay. Okay. It was an accident." Nabiki sighed. "The first time anyway." Nabiki shook her head. "Daddy is going to go ballistic." Nabiki unconsciously leaned against Tatewaki when he put his arm around his shoulders comfortingly.</p><p>"I wish there was something I could do to help." Tatewaki said quietly.</p><p>Kimi smiled. "You're doing it, Tatewaki." She said quietly. "Don't worry Nabs." Kimi said in a stronger voice. "I think the three of us can figure out something."</p><p>"The three of us?" Tatewaki asked in surprise.</p><p>"Well of course, the three of us." Kimi replied. "You're Nabs' boyfriend aren't you?" She smiled. "Come to think of it, being Nabs' boyfriend would put a lot of rumors to bed wouldn't it?"</p><p>"B-boyfriend?" Stammered Tatewaki. "Not that I would find such a role onerous, but who would believe Nabiki Tendo would lower herself to consort with a fool no matter how wealthy?"</p><p>"Stop it." Nabiki said sharply. "You're not a fool. Obsessive, yes. Clueless, often, but you are not a fool."</p><p>"Thank you." Tatewaki replied. "I think."</p><p>"Then it's settled." Kimi said. "Tatewaki is now officially your boyfriend."</p><p>"Our boyfriend." Corrected Nabiki. Nabiki reached around Tatewaki and took Kimi's hand. "I still need my girlfriend." She looked at Tatewaki. "You don't mind, do you?"</p><p>Tatewaki laughed. "As you said; I am not a fool."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki picked up the phone. "Hello?" She said. "Oh hi sis. What's up?" Nabiki rolled her eyes. "You're a little late Akane." She said. "I already heard. From a friend." Nabiki nodded at something Akane said. "Sure, we can meet you there." Nabiki laughed. "Does Kasumi know?" Nabiki laughed again. "Do me a favor, don't tell her."<hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Are you sure this is the right place Ono?" Kasumi asked. She eyed the building nervously. "This can't be right."<p>Dr. Tofu looked at the piece of paper in his hand. "This is the address Akane gave you." He said after a moment. "Wait here." He walked over to the front of the building where a burly man in a suit stood. "Excuse me." He said to the man. "Do you have anyone named Aoi or Usagi working here?"</p><p>The man laughed. "Oh yeah." He said in a tone of admiration. "They're our two top dancers." Ono waved over Kasumi. The bouncer raised an eyebrow at Kasumi. "The cover is two thousand yen for you; your girlfriend gets in free." The man leaned closer to Ono. "There's an amateur competition later. See if you can talk her into it." He gave Kasumi an appreciative look. "The prize is twenty thousand yen, from what I can see, she's a lock."</p><p>Ono took Kasumi's hand. "Thanks." Ono said in doubtful tones. "I think." He led Kasumi into the dimness of the Kabuki Theater.</p><p>"Ono?" Kasumi said as they entered the club. "What is this place?" She looked around, suddenly she gripped Ono's hand hard. "Oh gods Ono, that woman is almost naked." She squeaked. "Kasumi. Doc." Called a familiar voice. Kasumi turned to see a young man in a white suite approach. "Excuse me." Kasumi said nervously. "Do we know," Kasumi stopped. "Ukyo?"</p><p>Ukyo grinned. "Come on I have a table reserved for you." Ukyo walked next to Kasumi as she led them into the dim recesses of the club. "Here we go." Ukyo pulled out a chair for Kasumi. "Sit." She said cheerfully.</p><p>A man walked over to the table. "New girl Big Daddy?" The man said looking at Kasumi. He shook his head in admiration. "Where do you find them?"</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "They find me." She replied. "Sorry Hiro but she's not working."</p><p>"Darn." Hiro replied. He looked at Kasumi again. "You gonna dance later?" He asked.</p><p>"Dance?" Squeaked Kasumi. "N-no. I don't think so."</p><p>"Pity." The man replied. "You'd probably win." The man shook his head and walked away.</p><p>Ukyo snorted and sat down. Ukyo looked at Kasumi and grinned. "Hiro is right. You would win." Ukyo chuckled. "Relax Kasumi, no one will bother you here." Ukyo smile became slightly cold. "And if they do, you have enough protectors to keep you safe."</p><p>Ono moved his chair closer to Kasumi. "Don't worry sweetheart. I'm here."</p><p>"Where exactly is here?" Kasumi asked. "What is this place?" She looked at the stage where the dancer was down to a g-string. "Ono." She hissed. "That man just put money in that girl's," Kasumi broke off. "Oh my." Kasumi fanned herself.</p><p>Ukyo stood. "I have to check on the guys." She said. "I'd keep an eye on the Doc if I were you, Kasumi. Some of the girls here are a little aggressive." With a grin Ukyo walked away.</p><p>Kasumi and Ono looked at each other. "Ono?"</p><p>Ono Tofu studiously avoided looking at the stage. "She was just joking." He said nervously. "Hey guys." Came a voice. "Did we miss anything?" Three people approached the table.</p><p>"Nabiki." Kasumi greeted her younger sister with concern in her voice. "Have you heard?"</p><p>Nabiki raised a hand. "I heard." She replied. She pulled the person next to her closer. "My friend." Nabiki said with emphasis. "Warned me."</p><p>"Tatewaki." Kasumi said in disbelief. "Friend?"</p><p>"Yeah, I know. Hard to believe huh?" Nabiki said easily. "But it's true." Nabiki, Tatewaki and Kimi sat down at the table.</p><p>"None were more surprised than I." Tatewaki said with a touch of embarrassment. "Yet it is so."</p><p>"Not me." Kimi said with a sly grin. "How you doing Kasumi?"</p><p>"I am well Kimi." Kasumi looked down. "I believe I owe you an apology." She said. "When I heard the rumor I, I blamed you."</p><p>"Can't blame you for that." Kimi replied. "But I think you should have had more faith in your sister."</p><p>Kasumi nodded. "You're right." Kasumi smiled. "You don't know how relieved I am to be wrong about someone."</p><p>"You weren't exactly wrong, sis." Nabiki said seriously. "And the rumor isn't exactly false."</p><p>Tatewaki leaned toward Kasumi. "Do not listen to her." He said. "Your sister is honor incarnate."</p><p>"Thus speaks a man in love." Snorted Kimi. She grinned when both Nabiki and Tatewaki blushed. Her grin faded and her expression became pensive. "Nabs did what she had to do. She was very brave."</p><p>"You were there too Kimi." Nabiki reached over and took Kimi's hand. "If I was brave, then so were you." The two women gazed at each other. It was the kind of look two soldiers, sisters in arms, would give each other. A look that held a shared experience that only they could understand. Nabiki released Kimi's hand and turned back to Kasumi.</p><p>Kasumi watched the interplay between Kimi and Nabiki. 'They have the same look Akane and Ranma had when they came back from Jusendo.' She thought. "Maybe you both could come over tomorrow night for dinner." Kasumi said. "Father will be happy to see you."</p><p>Nabiki seemed to sag slightly. "You don't know how much I'd love to do just that." She said. "Do you mind if Tatewaki comes too?"</p><p>"Of course." Kasumi said warmly. "We'll ask Akane, Ranma and Ukyo to come and we'll have a party." Kasumi looked around. "Speaking of which; where are they?"</p><p>The girl on stage finished her set and ran off. A man in a white suit came on stage holding a microphone. "Is that Ukyo?" Kasumi whispered.</p><p>"Good evening everyone." Ukyo began. "Is everyone having a good time?" There were scattered affirmatives from the audience. "Good. Good." Ukyo said. "Now I know everyone is waiting for Usagi to come out but we have a special treat. Usagi has told me that she and Aoi have worked on a new routine." Ukyo leaned forward conspiratorially. "That's right; your two favorite girls are coming out...together." There were hoots and cheers from the crowd. "Ladies and Gentlemen." Ukyo chuckled. "Yes there are a few ladies here." She said to the crowd. Ukyo waved her hand. "Usagi and Aoi." Instead of leaving the stage, Ukyo walked over to the curtain and pulled it open. Akane and Ranma in matching green sequined bikinis stood together, one arm raised and the other wrapped around each other's waists. They ran out to the center of the stage. The music began. It was a slow and sensual beat. Totally unlike the more usual hard driving beat that usually played.</p><p>Ranma and Akane spun away from each other and stopped facing each other at each end of the stage. The stage had two poles and Akane and Ranma jumped on to the poles. They inverted their bodies and then slid slowly down in complete unison. Ukyo then walked to the center of the stage and Akane and Ranma started crawling, catlike toward her.</p><p>Kasumi started fanning herself. "Oh my."</p><p>Ranma and Akane reached Ukyo at the same time and then seemed to wind their way up Ukyo's legs. Their heads leaned against Ukyo's hips. Their hands slid up Ukyo's thighs. Ukyo reached down and intercepted the hands. She pulled Akane and Ranma to their feet. They leaned against Ukyo for a second, then spun toward each other. Akane and Ranma embraced. It was obvious the embrace was more than just part of the routine. They separated again.</p><p>Kasumi fanned herself harder. "Oh dear." She squeaked. Her other hand clutched Ono's hand.</p><p>Nabiki leaned toward Tatewaki. "Should I wear my red wig tonight lover?" She asked. "I'll wear the black one." Kimi whispered from Tatewaki's other side. Tatewaki nodded without taking his eyes off of the antics of Ranma and Akane.</p><p>Akane and Ranma were each dancing sensuously against a pole as Ukyo left the stage. Ukyo made her way from backstage to the table near the back of the club. She sat down. "That was fun." She said. She looked around the table. Her eyes widened when she saw Tatewaki.</p><p>"Why are those men waving money?" Kasumi asked without taking her eyes off the dancing duo. "Eep." She squeaked when Akane squatted in front of one patron. Kasumi clutched Ono's hand tighter. She turned. "Ono? Is my baby sister doing what I think she's doing?" She asked. "Ono?" She asked again when he didn't answer. Kasumi looked at Ono's face. His glasses were beginning to steam up. Kasumi slapped him. "Ono!" She exclaimed angrily. "Stop looking at my sister's breasts." She said. "If you want to look at breasts, look at mine." Kasumi's hand flew to her mouth when she realized what she said.</p><p>Ono turned his head. "I'd love to." He said with a gleam in his eye. "Tonight?" He asked. Kasumi nodded her head rapidly. Ono pulled his chair closer to Kasumi and wrapped her in his arms. "Let's watch the rest of the show."</p><p>Akane and Ranma finished their set and, after collecting any stray bills on the stage, ran off. "Man, I knew doing a duet would pay off." Ranma chortled as she quickly counted the bills in her hand.</p><p>Akane nodded cheerfully. 'Not to mention I get to be with you.' She thought happily. 'Yeah, that was good thinking Ranma." She said. "Come on, let's change. I can't wait to see Kasumi." Ranma nodded and followed her into the dressing room. They changed into their street clothes and walked into the main part of the club.</p><p>Kasumi looked up when Ranma and Akane approached. She gave Akane a tremulous smile. "Tha-that was very nice." She said.</p><p>Akane grinned. "Thanks sis." She gave Kasumi a warm hug. "Hey Nabs. Hey Kimi. Omigod is that Tatewaki?" Akane ducked behind Ranma. "Eep."</p><p>"A little late to be bashful Sis." Nabiki said cheerfully. She turned to Tatewaki. "And if you make a scene you're going home alone. Got it?" Tatewaki wiped his brow and nodded. "Good." Nabiki said firmly. She turned back to Akane who was still peeking from behind Ranma. Ranma herself was in a defensive stance. "Don't worry guys, he's under control."</p><p>"Hell with that." Complained Ranma. "What's he doing here?" Ranma glared at Tatewaki.</p><p>"He's with us." Kimi said with a sly smile. She put a hand on Tatewaki's shoulder. "Aren't you baby?"</p><p>Tatewaki took a deep breath. "Indeed." He said. He turned to Akane and Ranma. "I hope this does not disappoint you my former loves but, as you can see, I have moved on."</p><p>Akane, Ranma and Ukyo shared a look of disbelief. "Ohhkayy." Akane drawled. She looked at Nabiki and raised an eyebrow. Nabiki shrugged helplessly then leaned against Tatewaki. Akane sat down gingerly. "He knows huh?"</p><p>"Tatewaki is the one who told me." Nabiki said. "The big idiot wanted to make sure we heard it from," Nabiki looked up at Tatewaki. "A friend."</p><p>Ranma shook her head. "Takes all kinds." She whispered to Ukyo. Ranma leaned against the table. "Any idea who's messing with you?" She asked Nabiki.</p><p>"The list is endless right now." Nabiki replied sourly. "Though I'm not certain the target is me." Nabiki rubbed her chin. "It could be Daddy." She shook her head. "Though why anyone would want to hurt daddy is beyond me." She shook her head again. "Regardless, the result would be a wedge between me and Daddy." She nodded at Tatewaki. "That's where Tatewaki comes in." To everyone's, except Kimi, amazement Nabiki blushed.</p><p>"I will be asking Mr. Tendo's permission to court Nabiki." Tatewaki looked at Nabiki.</p><p>"You're getting married?" Akane almost screamed. "To Kuno?" Akane buried her face in her hands. "Great. Just great." She moaned.</p><p>"We're not getting married Sis." Nabiki said in annoyance. "Tatewaki is my boyfriend." She replied hotly. "Just my boyfriend."</p><p>"Now." Ranma grumbled. "Just you wait." She shook a finger at Nabiki. "You're gonna end up liking him, I know it." She buried her face in her hands like Akane. "She's gonna marry Kuno." Ranma and Akane moaned in unison through their fingers.</p><p>"Oh this is wonderful." Kasumi chirped. "Daddy will be so happy." She nodded. "And put the lie to those horrid rumors." Kasumi dusted her hands in satisfaction. "I must call Auntie." She looked at Nabiki. "Tatewaki will ask Father for permission first then we'll celebrate your engagement."</p><p>"He's just asking permission to date me, Kasumi. Not marry me." Nabiki rolled her eyes. "I want a boyfriend not a fiancé. Okay?"</p><p>"Same thing." Akane grumbled. "Welcome to the family Tatewaki." Akane said in a depressed monotone. "I hope you and Nabiki are very happy."</p><p>"Thank you Akane Tendo." Tatewaki replied. "I shall endeavor to do my best."</p><p>"And his best ain't too shabby." Kimi cracked. "Tatewaki has some unexpected talents." She nudged Tatewaki with an elbow. "Don't you baby?"</p><p>"I really, really don't want to know." Akane said glumly. She sighed. "Tatewaki and Nabiki," She raised an eyebrow at Kimi. "And Kimi?" Kimi nodded. "Wonderful." Akane grumbled.</p><p>"I wouldn't talk if I were you sis." Nabiki shot back.</p><p>Kasumi giggled. "I forgot how much fun it was to have my sisters around." She leaned against Ono with a sigh.</p><p>Ukyo looked at her watch. "Excuse me." She said standing. "I have something to do." She looked at Ranma and Akane with an odd little smile and then walked away.</p><p>"What was that about?" Ranma asked Akane. Akane shrugged. "Ukyo's been acting mysterious all week." Ranma explained. "She picked a bad time to leave too." She said. "The amateur contest is about to start." Ranma's eyes widened. "You don't suppose..."</p><p>"She wouldn't." Akane replied. "Would she?"</p><p>"I dunno." Ranma looked at the stage. "I mean, I know she's always been jealous of your looks and it's always bothered her that she's so often mistaken for a boy, but..." Ranma trailed off as the announcer walked out on stage.</p><p>"Good evening." He began. "It's Thursday night and as all of you know, Thursday night is amateur night." There were whistles and hoots from the crowd. The announcer seemed to look directly toward Kasumi. "There is still time to enter. First prize is twenty thousand yen." He said in an encouraging tone. "The rules are simple. Each contestant will perform a five minute set to music of their choice. After the final contestant finishes her performance all the contestants will come out on stage and you will choose the winner by applause." The announcer smiled. "The winner will also have the opportunity to become a regular performer here at the Kabuki Club." Again the announcer seemed to look directly at Kasumi. "Okay guys you have five more minutes to convince your girlfriend to take it off."</p><p>"Ono?" Kasumi asked. "Why does that man keep looking at me?"</p><p>"Well um, you see." Ono stammered.</p><p>"Put it this way sis." Akane said with a grin. "You'd win. Even without dancing." Akane smiled at Kasumi's blush. "Right Doc?"</p><p>Akane turned her chair around so she could see the stage better. The first two dancers came and went. In Akane's opinion they were okay but nothing special. The third dancer walked on stage. Akane sat up straighter. "Oh gods, that's Ukyo." She whispered.</p><p>Ukyo was standing in the middle of the stage waiting for the music to start. She was wearing, Akane noted, a short white skirt and blouse that seemed a cross between her Big Daddy outfit and a high school girl's outfit. "Damn she has great legs." Akane muttered.</p><p>"Just noticed?" Ranma said with a chuckle. The music started and conversation ceased. "Ohh my." Ranma breathed. "I am so glad I'm a girl right now." Ranma grinned at the sound of a slap from behind her. "You're gonna have to forgive the Doc." Ranma said quietly without taking her eyes off the stage. "Ohh, that was a nice move." She murmured.</p><p>"No kidding." Akane whispered back. "Why the hell are we whispering?" Akane stood and whistled in appreciation. "You go girl." She yelled. "Shake that thing." Akane's cries of appreciation were picked up by the rest of the observers. Akane ran to the stage and threw several hundred yen notes on the stage.</p><p>Ukyo grinned when she saw Akane and danced over to her. Ukyo squatted down in front of Akane. "Surprise." She said cheerfully.</p><p>"You're doing great Ukyo." Akane said with a grin.</p><p>Ranma ran up to the stage, next to Akane and waved some more notes. "Alright Uk-chan." She exclaimed gleefully. 'We gotta get her a stage name.' Ranma thought. Ranma turned to the crowd. "What are you waiting for?" She demanded. "Show some appreciation." There were grins from the observers and Ukyo soon found dozens of men waving bills. "Go to work Uk-chan." Ranma said with a grin.</p><p>"What say we shit can the Big Daddy routine and let Ukyo join us as a dancer?" Ranma asked Akane. "Even if she doesn't win tonight,"</p><p>"She will." Akane responded. "I have no problem with it." Akane realized to her surprise she meant it. "Another income would be nice." Akane snorted. "I think this is Ukyo telling us she wants to make her own money again." She said.</p><p>Ranma nodded. "You're probably right." She replied. Ranma looked at Akane. "Thanks Tomboy."</p><p>"For what?" Akane replied. "Ukyo is not going anywhere anytime soon." Akane smiled wryly. "Neither am I." Akane turned back to the stage as Ukyo finished her set and ran backstage. Akane and Ranma applauded loudly. "That's my girl." Akane shouted to Ukyo's retreating back. Ukyo looked over her shoulder, grinned, and disappeared back stage. Akane grabbed Ranma's hand. "Come on." She said and pulled Ranma after her.</p><p>Ranma and Akane went backstage and into the dressing room. Ukyo was sitting at a vanity. A stack of money was on the vanity in front of her. She looked up as Ranma and Akane walked over.</p><p>"So?" Ukyo said shyly.</p><p>"You did great Ukyo." Akane said cheerfully. She giggled. "I think both Doctor Tofu and Tatewaki are not going to get a lot of sleep tonight." She giggled again. "Especially Dr. Tofu."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "You were hot Uk-chan." She pulled at her pigtail. "Gonna miss Big Daddy a little, I think."</p><p>"Don't worry Ranma." Akane said quietly. "I'm sure Ukyo will dress up for you once in a while." She and Ukyo exchanged a look. Akane shook a finger. "If you ask nicely, that is." Akane smiled at Ranma's mock pout. She turned back to Ukyo. "How come you didn't tell us?" She asked.</p><p>Ukyo shrugged. "I guess I wasn't sure how you'd react." She replied. "I've been playing guys for so long."</p><p>"Told ya she could do it." Ranma said in an aside to Akane. "Didn't I?" She held out her hand. "Pay up."</p><p>Ukyo's eyes widened. "Ran-chan?" She squeaked.</p><p>Akane blushed. "Part of how Ranma got me to dance in the first place." She admitted grudgingly. "He said if I didn't, you would." She gave Ranma a sidelong glance. "Seems he was right." She reached into her pocket. She pulled out a bill. "Knew I had one." She handed the yen note to Ranma.</p><p>Ranma took the note cheerfully. "Hell with the Big Daddy routine Uk-chan. We are going to be the biggest draw this shit hole ever saw." She said. "Right?"</p><p>"Right!" Chorused Akane and Ukyo.</p><p>A woman stuck her head into the dressing room. "They're going to pick the winner." She said. Ukyo stood and, along with several other women, started to file out. Ranma and Akane followed. They went to stand near the stage as the contestants came out.</p><p>Ukyo won.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki was silent in taxi on the ride back to Nabiki and Kimi's apartment. "What's the matter Tatewaki?" Nabiki asked.<p>Takewaki took a breath. "I fear I am not as over your sister and the pigtailed girl as I had thought." He admitted. "It was," Tatewaki paused. "Difficult to remain seated." He looked down at his clasped hands. "Forgive me for mine weakness."</p><p>"You'd have to be dead not to react." Nabiki drawled. "And you are certainly not dead." Her hand slid along Tatewaki's thigh. "Ooh. Not dead at all." She looked at Tatewaki. "We'll be home soon." She purred. "Then let's see if Kimi and I can," Nabiki paused.</p><p>"Distract you." Kimi finished. Nabiki looked over at Kimi. The two women nodded at each other.</p><p>Tatewaki's face reflected his confusion. "You are not upset that I still lust after others?"</p><p>Nabiki snorted in amusement. "That's how we started in the first place remember, a fantasy. " She reached up and tapped Tatewaki on the forehead. "Fantasize all you want, Tatewaki. I don't mind."</p><p>"Just don't call out the wrong name at the wrong time." Kimi added with a chuckle. "And make sure you bring it home to us."</p><p>The cab pulled up to the apartment. Kimi, Tatewaki and Nabiki got out. Tatewaki leaned over to pay the fare. "Hey mac." The driver said in envious tones. "Mind telling me your secret?"</p><p>Tatewaki smiled briefly. "Methinks being a fool helps." Tatewaki replied.</p><p>End Chapter 1</p><p>Author's notes: I bet you thought I'd never post a new chapter.</p>
