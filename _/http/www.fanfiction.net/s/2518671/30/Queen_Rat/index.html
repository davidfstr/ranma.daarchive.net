</div><p>Chapter 4</p><p>'Poor little rich girl'</p><p>Kodachi was working on a complex routine in her private gymnasium in the lower part of the Kuno mansion. 'A week.' She thought grumpily. 'They've been here a week." What bothered Kodachi the most was that Nabiki and Kimi, but especially Kimi, went out of their way to be affectionate to her brother in her presence. What bothered Kodachi almost as much was that despite the circumstances of their birth the two women had manners that Kodachi wished more of her peers had. Kodachi stopped her routine.</p><p>"Why can't they have the decency to act like whores." Kodachi grumbled. She looked up when the door to her private gym opened. Her eyes widened and her jaw dropped. "Ranma darling." She cooed. "And you've brought Ryoga." She said. "How nice."</p><p>"Aw Ryoga was just saying how much he missed his friends from the old days." Ranma replied. He put a smirk on his face. "Especially you."</p><p>"Indeed?" Kodachi gave Ryoga a barely acknowledging nod.</p><p>"Well I've always been a sucker for a pretty face." Ryoga said easily. "Got to admit there were few, if any, women as pretty as you. Or as talented."</p><p>Despite herself Kodachi found herself flattered. "You are too kind." She simpered.</p><p>"Just telling the truth." Ryoga replied. He sighed. "I used to go to all your competitions you know." He sighed again. "Poetry, pure poetry." He rubbed the back of his head. "There was this one competition, you were going against that girl from Osaka." He shook his head. "That move you did with the ribbon."</p><p>"You were there?" Kodachi asked in surprise. "I was lucky." She said modestly.</p><p>"You outclassed her from the get go." Ryoga said in disagreement. "Anyone who knows anything about Martial Arts Gymnastics knew that." Soon the two of them were deep in discussion over the finer points of Kodachi's chosen art. So engrossed were they that they did not see Ranma quietly leave the room. Of course his going into the Umisenken might have had something to do with it.</p><p>Ranma quickly made his way toward the third floor of the Kuno mansion. He walked to the end of the hall and knocked. The door opened. Ranma entered the darkened room. "How's it going?" He asked Akane as he sat down.</p><p>Akane handed Ranma a bowl of popcorn. "They're still talking." Akane said. "You don't really think he can do it do you?"</p><p>"Not really." Ranma shrugged. "Ryoga seemed pretty confident though."</p><p>"Ten thousand yen he does it." Nabiki said from her seat in front. She turned around to look at Ranma. "Even odds."</p><p>"You're on." Ranma replied.</p><p>"I confess the whole idea makes me uncomfortable." Tatewaki said glumly. "She deserves this but," Tatewaki sighed. "She is my sister."</p><p>"Don't worry baby." Kimi said soothingly. "We won't make you watch." She placed her hand loosely over Tatewaki's eyes. "Unless you want to."</p><p>"Oh crap." Ukyo exclaimed. "They're kissing." All heads snapped toward the wide screen television. "Pass the popcorn." Ukyo said without taking her eyes off the screen.</p><p>Akane giggled. "I think you're going to lose the bet Ranma." She said. "He's got his hand on her tits." She reached across Ranma and grabbed a handful of popcorn. "Hey turn up the sound." She said. "I bet she's a screamer."</p><p>"Oh Ryoga." Kodachi said in falsely scandalized tones. "You're so...assertive." Despite her words she made no move to evade Ryoga's advances. She sighed.</p><p>Ryoga leaned closer. "I can't help it." He asked in a husky voice. "You're so beautiful." He breathed in her ear. "You deserve to be worshipped." Ryoga said. 'Gods that's a corny line.' He thought. 'Bet it works.' Ryoga kneeled down in front of Kodachi and reached for her foot. "Let me worship you." He slowly removed Kodachi'slipper and kissed her foot.</p><p>"Gods that was a corny line." Ukyo snorted. "But it looks like it's working."</p><p>"Well he's got her slippers off." Ranma said conversationally. "Well what do you know, Kodachi likes 'shrimping'."</p><p>"So do you Ranma." Akane grabbed another handful of popcorn. "Now shut up the two of you I want to hear this." She said. "Whoa." She said a moment later. "Look at that."</p><p>"Shhh." Chorused Ranma, Ukyo, Nabiki, Kimi and, louder than the rest, Tatewaki.</p><p>"Oh Ryoga." Kodachi's breathless voice came over the sound system. Ryoga stood up in front of Kodachi. He dropped his trousers. The observers could see her eye's widen. "Oh Ryoga." She exclaimed.</p><p>"Turn around." Chorused the observers. "Isn't there another camera?" The scene changed. "Whoa." Came a chorus of exclamations.</p><p>"Heh." Said Ranma. "I'm still the best." He reached over and grabbed some more popcorn.</p><p>"Ooh." Akane breathed. She elbowed Ranma. "You've never done that to me." She complained.</p><p>"I didn't know you could do that." Ranma said in awe. He leaned over to Akane. "Later." He said quietly. Ranma grabbed another handful of popcorn. "Whoa."</p><p>"Girl's got some skills." Konatsu said in grudging admiration. "She's not gagging." He said. "I would."</p><p>"Yeah, probably the only way to shut her up though." Akane commented. "Her tits aint bad." She continued</p><p>"There goes the rest of the leotard." Ukyo cheered."Her ass is kind of skinny though." She said in her own assessment. "Any more popcorn?" She asked.</p><p>"There's more popcorn on the sideboard." Nabiki said cheerfully. She turned her head. "By the way lover, you are not getting any sleep tonight." She purred. "Right Kimi?" Kimi giggled in agreement.</p><p>Akane looked across Ranma to Ukyo. They rolled their eyes in unison. "yuck." Akane mouthed. Ukyo giggled stood and went to get some more popcorn.</p><p>"Should be me in there." Grumbled Ting Li. "Not skinny bitch." Her comments were greeted with laughter. "And I make sure he do that to me." She added firmly. Ting Li looked at the television sourly. "And that."</p><p>"I knew it; a landing strip." Akane observed. "Man he's going after that pussy like it was puppy chow."</p><p>"Pig chow, you mean." Ranma corrected. Akane snorted.</p><p>"Yep, she's a screamer." Nabiki commented as Kodachi's yells echoed from the speakers. "By the way Ranma you owe me ten thousand yen."</p><p>"Worth it." Ranma replied cheerfully. "Man look at her ass move." He exclaimed. "Ride'em cowgirl."</p><p>Kodachi's keening scream echoed through the sound system. The observers could see a faint sheen of sweat covering her body. Akane leaned against Ranma. "You're not getting any sleep tonight either." She whispered. "Ukyo stop that." She said a moment later.</p><p>"Meanie." Ukyo mock grumped. She removed her hand from Ranma's lap.</p><p>"Not fair." Grumped Ting Li.</p><p>"If you ask nicely, maybe Kodachi will let you join them." Ukyo said "You know, now that I think of it, that would have been even better."</p><p>"Do you think they'd let me join in too?" Konatsu asked hopefully.</p><p>"With Ryoga?" Ranma replied. "Not a chance."</p><p>"Bet I could." Konatsu said confidently. "Bet I could make him squeal like a pig." Konatu grinned. "And he has such a pretty mouth." Ranma laughed.</p><p>"Oh, oh Pig Boy looks like he's about to blow." Akane sat up. "On her face Ryoga, on her face." She shouted to the television screen. "Yes." She hissed. Her arm pumped the air in triumph.</p><p>"I did not realize mine sister was so," Tatewaki paused as he searched for a word. "Wanton." He said finally. He patted his forehead with a handkerchief. "I think that should be sufficient." He stood awkwardly. Nabiki and Kimi stood quickly. He turned to the rest of the observers. "If you'll excuse us." He said. "I'm sure you can find your own way out."</p><p>The rest of the group rose. "Night Kuno." Ranma said. "Remember Nabs, Konatsu gets a copy." He grinned. "Make one for us as well okay?"</p><p>"Of course Ranma." Nabiki smiled evilly. "Everyone knows a fairy godmother is supposed to grant three wishes."</p><p>Akane snorted. "Much as I love you Sis, I don't see you as a fairy godmother."</p><p>"I wasn't talking about me." Nabiki replied. With a grin she took Tatewaki's arm and left the room.</p><p>"If she didn't mean herself, who did she mean?" Akane asked. Akane looked at the television where the images of Ryoga and Kodachi were entangled in each other's arms. Suddenly she chuckled. "Oh." She said with a grin that matched Nabiki's at it's most evil. "Ooh, now what should we wish for?" She linked her arms through the arms of Ranma and Ukyo. "I don't know about you two but I'm horny as hell." She said. "And I want to sleep in the middle." She looked over her shoulder at Konatsu and Ting Li. "See you later guys."</p><p>Ting Li watched the three leave. "I need a man." She grumbled.</p><p>"Me too." Konatsu said. He turned to Ting Li. "I know a couple places we can check out." He said. "Some swing both ways."</p><p>Ting Li smiled wryly. "What we waiting for? Let's go."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi woke the following morning. She rolled over to find the bed empty. Frowning she sat up. Ryoga was sitting at the foot of the bed pulling on his boots. "Ryoga?" She said. "I hope you weren't planning to leave without saying goodbye." Her voice took on a dangerous tone.<p>Ryoga turned around. "Morning." He said cheerfully. He stood. "Actually I was." He said. He raised his hand. "I'm not really good at morning talk and, besides I'm pretty sure I'd say something stupid and ruin the whole thing." He walked over to the side of the bed and looked down at Kodachi. "Last night was too nice to ruin." He said. 'besides I better get out of here before they spring their surprise.' He thought.</p><p>"Will, will I see you again?" Kodachi asked hesitantly. 'What a sweet thing to say.' She thought.</p><p>"Who knows." Ryoga shrugged. He reached into his wallet and pulled out a card. "Here, call me sometime." He gave the card to Kodachi. He leaned down. "You are one hot woman Kodachi Kuno." He said quietly. He straightened up and before Kodachi could blink he was gone.</p><p>Kodachi stretched, then chuckled. "The boy is smarter than he looks." She said to the empty room. "Here I was worried about how to get rid of him." She threw back the covers and made her way to the bathing area. She indulged herself in a long soak in the furo before returning to her room, dressing and making her way down to the dining room. Last night put her in too much of a good mood that not even the presence of 'those' women could dampen her spirits.</p><p>"Good morning, everyone." Kodachi said cheerfully. She looked at the wall clock. "My we all overslept this morning." She commented. She lifted the metal lid that covered her breakfast plate. Her started in surprise to find an envelope, the kind usually used for pictures, sitting in the middle of the plate. "What's this?" She asked.</p><p>"A present." Kimi said with a slight smile.</p><p>"A present?' Kodachi looked at Kimi curiously. "What do you mean?"</p><p>"Open it.." Nabiki said in a tone that was more command than request. "Then I'm going to explain a few things to you."</p><p>Kodachi bristled at Nabiki's tone but swallowed a retort. The look in the other woman's eyes was cold and dangerous. She looked at the envelope and a gasp escaped from her. "No." She said in horror. "You didn't." With shaking fingers she tilted the envelope toward the table. A small stack of pictures and a computer disk tumbled out. Kodachi picked up one of the prints and looked at it. The picture showed an expecially pornographic image of her and Ryoga. "No." She gasped again.</p><p>"I'm a fair person." Nabiki said in icy tones. "I don't believe in punishing anyone more than necessary." Nabiki's tone seemed to get even colder. "I don't care what you think about me but you embarrassed and hurt my Father."</p><p>"You do the same to my family." Kodachi spat back angrily. "Kuno's do not associate with prostitutes and," She pointed an angry finger at Nabiki. "Yakusa." She hissed. She turned her gaze toward Tatewaki. "You shame us Brother." She said. "A true Kuno would die rather than associate with such."</p><p>"Be silent!" Roared Tatewaki. "Do not speak to me of what a true Kuno would do." He half stood and leaned across the table toward Kodachi. "Do not speak to me of shame." Kimi put a hand on Tatewaki and he subsided. Slightly. "Our father is a madman. Silence." He snapped as Kodachi made to speak. "And we were well on our way to our own madness." He shook his head. "Parasites. That was what a true Kuno has been. Parasites."</p><p>"You weren't that bad Baby." Nabiki said softly.</p><p>"Thank you My Lady." Tatewaki replied.</p><p>"Lady? Her?" Kodachi said in disbelief.</p><p>"Aye Lady." Tatewaki replied firmly. "If only you had half the nobility either of My Ladies have." He said wistfully.</p><p>"Ladies?" Kodachi's voice rose in a near shriek. "Tendo I could almost understand but:" She shot a meaningful glare at Kimi.</p><p>"You can say it Kodachi." Kimi said evenly. "Prostitute, whore, slut." She smiled wryly. "It's the truth." Her eyes moistened when both Tatewaki and Nabiki made their disapproval known. "It's what I've been." She amended.</p><p>Tatekwai put his arm around Kimi's shoulders. "You did what you had to do My Lady." Tatewaki replied. "There is no shame in that." He turned to Kodachi. "You, who have done nothing to put food on your table, have never known want or privation, and have had any need or desire granted instantly, would dare cast judgement?" Tatewaki said angrily. "You know nothing!"</p><p>"A Kuno is above such things." Kodachi said haughtily. Kodachi seemed to freeze and her face turned pale. She looked down at the pictures in her hand.</p><p>"Aye Sister." Tatewaki said with satisfaction in his voice. "The truth of what a Kuno is rests in your hands."</p><p>Kodachi buried her face in her hands. "How could you do this to your own sister?" She said brokenly. "I was protecting the family name."</p><p>"Kodachi." Nabiki's voice was a whip. Like a puppet on a string Kodachi's head shot up. "Did you think I would do less?" To Kodachi's surprise Nabiki bowed low.</p><p>"Why? Why do you bow?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Because I honor why you did it." Nabiki said sitting up. "I would have done the same." Her eyes narrowed. "And I have." Nabiki pointed toward the pictures and disk with her chin. "Those are yours to do with as you wish." She said. "There are two other copies."</p><p>Kodachi grabbed the pictures and the disk as if afraid Nabiki would change her mind. "T-two other copies?" She asked in a whisper.</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "If you wish them returned then you will do exactly as you are told." Nabiki informed the gymnast. "Any attempt to retrieve them, other than by performing the tasks assigned to you, will result in," Nabiki smiled. "unfortunate consequences." She impaled Kodachi with her eyes. "Do we understand each other?" Kodachi nodded mutely. "Good." Nabiki leaned forward. "The second copy is held by Konatsu Kanzen."</p><p>"And the third?" Kodachi asked</p><p>"Konatsu will tell you." Nabiki said. "If you complete the task he assigns you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The bell over the door of Uk-chan's rang. Konatsu ran over to the door. "Welcome to Uk-chan's." The transvestite martial artist said in a pleasant voice. A slow smile appeared on his pretty face. "Well, well Kodachi Kuno. What a pleasant surprise."<p>Kodachi gave Konatsu a sour look. "Let's not pretend." She said impatiently. "Tell me what it is you want."</p><p>Konatsu waved a finger. "Now. Now." Konatsu admonished. "First you must say hello to Auntie Nodoka." He linked his arm through Kodachi's. "Come along." Konatsu led the reluctant Kodachi toward the grill. "Auntie." Konatsu called. "Look who's come to visit."</p><p>Nodoka looked up from the grill. "Why if it isn't Kodachi Kuno." She said in recognition. "It's been too long." She pointed to a vacant seat in front of the grill. "Please sit." She said. "What brings you to Uk-chan's?" She asked.</p><p>"Kodachi and I are going out dancing tonight." Konatsu said.</p><p>"She is?" Nodoka said in surprise.</p><p>"I am?" Kodachi said at the same time.</p><p>"Oh yes." Konatsu said cheerfully. "Isn't that right Kodachi?"</p><p>"Yes?" Kodachi replied. "I mean, yes."</p><p>"Oh how nice." Nodoka said warmly. "Let me guess, you want the rest of the day off so you can get ready." Nodoka rolled her eyes. "Young girls never change." She waved her hands. "Shoo." She said.</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Konatsu pulled Kodachi to her feet. Kodachi was amazed by the strength she felt in the transvestites arm. "Let's go Kodachi. We have just enough time to get a manicure and a facial before we go out." Before Kodachi could blink she was walking down the street.</p><p>"She does know you are a man." Kodachi asked after they had walked awhile.</p><p>Konatsu giggled. "Oh yes, but Auntie likes to pretend otherwise." Konatsu smiled prettily. "And I like to pretend she's really my Aunt." She looked at Kodachi's face. "Oh don't look so glum." She scolded. "We'll have a wonderful time."</p><p>Kodachi eyed the transvestite dubiously. "If this is supposed to be revenge it doesn't appear to be very effective." Kodachi said slowly. She grimaced at Konatsu's laugh. "It is revenge isn't it?"</p><p>"I suppose." Konatsu replied. "Oh here we are." They stopped in front of a beauty salon. "They do the most wonderful facials here." Konatsu stated.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "I know." She replied. "I come here myself." They entered the salon. As she expected she was greeted warmly by the vairous members of the establishment. What she didn't expect was that Konatsu received as warm a greeting. A woman came rushing over. "Hello Miko."</p><p>"Kodachi, my dear." Miko, the owner of the salon said in greeting. She and Kodachi exchanged kisses on the cheek. Her eyes widened at seeing Konatsu. "Natsu." She squealed. "I didn't know you were friends with Kodachi Kuno."</p><p>"Well not friends, exactly." Konatsu said cheerfully. "We were introduced by a mutual friend. Kodachi expressed interest in going to the Black Orchid and I promised to take her." The silence that greeted Konatsu's announcement seemed to envelope the entire salon. Then the whispering began. Kodachi blushed.</p><p>Miko gave Kodachi an appraising look. "Kodachi Kuno going to the Black Orchid?" She shook her head. "And here I thought you were hopelessly hetero." The look she gave Kodachi was frank and hungry. Kodachi blushed even redder.</p><p>"Hetero yes." Konatsu agreed. "we're just not sure about the hopelessly part." He smiled at Miko's laughter.</p><p>"Well come along." Miko crooked a finger. "I will handle the facials personally." She looked at Kodachi. "Your usual French manicure Kodachi dear?" she asked. "Or will you be dressing a little more, oh, butch tonight?"</p><p>Kodachi looked helplessly at Konatsu. "Am I?" She asked in a near whisper.</p><p>"Oh no Miko." Konatsu said. "Could you see Kodachi dressed as a man, and pulling it off? No. That would be silly." Konatsu sat down in a salon chair and waved the relieved Kodachi into the one next to him. "Just make us look," Konatsu leaned back in the chair. "Beautiful."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The limo pulled up in front of the Black Orchid. A man jumped out of the drivers seat and opened the passenger door. Two people stepped out of the rear. The first was Kodachi Kuno. She was dressed in a short red skirt and matching red blouse. Following her out of the limo came Konatsu. The ninja wore a similar outfit though in a peach color that matched her complexion. The moment the two had exited the limo the night was lit with camera flashes. To Kodachi's dismay one of the papparazzi ran over, his camera flashing wildly. "What are they doing here?" Kodachi complained.<p>"I guess someone might have tipped them off." Konatsu said airily.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno. Ms Kuno." The photographer said excitedly. "Please can I get the two of you to stand together. Wow, Kodachi Kuno and Konatsu Kanzen together, if this doesn't get me a raise nothing will." He burbled.</p><p>"Well I," Began Kodachi. She was interrupted when Konatsu linked arms with Kodachi.</p><p>"Oh please Kodachi." Konatsu said prettily. "Let the man take his picture." He leaned closer. "Or you don't get your pictures." Kodachi smiled widely. "Now was that so hard?" Konatsu asked in a whisper.</p><p>"You have no idea." Kodachi said through her smile. "I'm going to hear about this for months."</p><p>"That was the idea." Konatsu replied. He turned to the photographer. "That's enough," He said. "For now,' With a wave Konatsu led Kodachi toward the entrance. "Hi Mako." He greeted the bouncer. "I'm sure you know my companion."</p><p>"Konatsu." The big, burly bouncer said in cheeful greeting. The look he gave Kodachi was puzzled. "This is the last place I'd expect to see you Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Don't worry Mako." Konatsu replied. "I'll vouch for her."</p><p>Kodachi looked at Konatsu in shock. 'Vouch for me?' She thought in disbelief. Before she could say anything Mako lifted the velvet rope and let them into the club. "Vouch for me?" Kodachi finally managed to get out.</p><p>"Mako just wants to make sure you're not going to cause any trouble." Konatsu said reassuringly. "The Black Orchid is a place where people," Konatsu waved a hand. "My kind of people come to have a good time. Mako hates it when there's trouble." Konatsu turned to Kodachi. "You're not going to make any trouble are you?" Kodachi shook her head. "See. Then there is nothing to worry about." Konatsu led Kodachi through the dimly lit recesses of the club and to a table. A card with the word 'Reserved' sat in the middle of the table. "Here we are." Konatsu announced.</p><p>"You reserved a table?" Kodachi asked. "You really didn't need to go to such trouble." Kodachi looked around. The table was near the dance floor but its position seemed designed to afford some level of privacy. "I must admit I appreciate it. Thank you."</p><p>"Careful Kodachi, someone might think there's a human being under that cold exterior." Konatsu said with a touch of laughter in his voice. "Actually this is our regular table."</p><p>"I am not cold." Kodachi complained. "Am I?" Then Konatsu's comment registered. "Regular table?"</p><p>Konatsu nodded. "This table is reserved for the Terrible Three and their friends." He replied. "Everyone else is by invitation only." Konatsu sat up. "Looks like we were expected." Konatsu pointed to where a waitress was hurrying over with a wine bucket.</p><p>She, at least Kodachi thought it was a woman, quickly set up the bucket, bowed to Kodachi and Konatsu and hurried away. Kodachi noticed a card next to the wine bucket and picked it up. It was addressed to her. She opened it. 'I understand the wine here is terrible. Drink this instead.' It was signed by her brother. "Tatewaki comes here?" She said in disbelief.</p><p>"I doubt it." Konatsu replied. He looked at the card. "And the wine here isn't really that bad." Konatsu laughed. "Well pour me a glass. I've always wanted to know what truly good wine is supposed to taste like."</p><p>Kodachi looked at the bottle and her eyebrows rose. "Well you're about to find out." She said in approval. "This is from our private stock." Despite the situation Kodachi found she was both pleased and flattered by her brother's concern. She poured the wine into the glasses and handed one to Konatsu. "Savor it." She told the transvestite ninja. "Don't gulp."</p><p>Konatsu smiled and then took an experimental sip. "Oh that is good." Kodachi nodded in agreement.</p><p>Two glasses later Kodachi found herself relaxing. No one was bothering her with unwanted attention and no one was taking her picture. She looked around curiously. One couple caught her eye. "Are those two men?" She asked in a whisper. Konatsu looked to where Kodachi indicated. He nodded. "And no one says anything?" Kodachi asked in surprise.</p><p>"Here?" Konatsu laughed. "They wouldn't dare and they shouldn't care." Konatsu leaned forward. "And neither should you." He said firmly.</p><p>Kodachi's mouth moved for a second as if to protest then she stopped. "You are right." She said finally. "I have no right to speak."</p><p>"By all the Kami in heaven, the girl is human after all." Konatsu grinned impishly. "You keep this up and I may end up liking you." He said. "Now how about we dance a little?"</p><p>"You and I?" Kodachi asked. She blanched at Konatsu's nod. "I-I thought I wasn't your," She hesitated. "Type." She finished.</p><p>"You're not." Konatsu agreed cheerfully. "Didn't you ever go dancing with your girlfriends?" To Konatsu's surprise Kodachi shook her head. "You're kidding?" Kodachi shook her head again. Konatsu stood. "Come on girlfriend. Let's dance."</p><p>To Kodachi's surprise she had a wonderful time though it wasn't until they were in limo and going home that Kodachi realized how good a time she had. She looked at Konatsu who was looking out the window. "K-Konatsu." Kodachi said hesitantly. "I hope it wasn't too dull being stuck with me this evening."</p><p>Konatsu turned his head and looked at Kodachi in surprise. "Dull?" He asked. "What makes you think it was dull?" Konatsu straightened her skirt. "I had a great time." He said. "Though I did have to forego a few things." He laughed at Kodachi's expression. "Oh don't worry, there's always another time."</p><p>Despite herself Kodachi giggled. "A few things." She said in amusement. "I can't believe how many men," She looked at Konatsu. "They were men weren't they?" Konatsu grinned and nodded. "I can't believe how many men wanted to dance with you."</p><p>"Look who's talking." Konatsu replied easily. "You were developing quite a fan club of your own."</p><p>Kodachi giggled. "I was, wasn't I?" She preened slightly. She leaned closer to Konatsu. "It was not what I expected." She said. "I don't mean the club, I mean, oh I don't know what I mean." She threw her hands up. "If it had been me I would have been scheming to hurt you." She admitted.</p><p>"You did." Konatsu replied quietly.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "Yes I did, didn't I? I hope you'll forgive me one day." She said. "You know what's funny?" She said a moment later. "If you had tried to hurt me the way I hurt you I could have just brushed it off." She snorted. "I was prepared to be hated. I could handle being hated." She looked at Konatsu. "You're a cruel man Konatsu Kanzen." She said</p><p>"Cruel?" Konatsu asked in surprise.</p><p>Kodachi nodded sadly. "So smug was I in my supposed superiority that I treated you horribly and thought I was correct in my actions. Oh yes, I am so superior." She said in self disgust. "My Brother was right. I know nothing."</p><p>Konatsu gave Kodachi a searching look then pulled a manila that he had concealed somewhere on his body. "Here." He said. "You've earned this."</p><p>Kodachi looked at the envelope for a long moment but made no move to take it. "Do me a favor Konatsu." She said finally. "Hold on to it." She smiled faintly. "I'd just destroy it."</p><p>Konatsu's eyes widened in surprise. "I'll hold on to it, for now." He said after a moment. He pursed his lips. "Do you want to know who holds the third copy?"</p><p>Kodachi's mouth twisted sourly. "It's Akane, isn't it?" Kodachi sighed when Konatsu nodded. "I think I dread her more than either you or Nabiki."</p><p>"I'll go with you if you'd like." Konatsu offered.</p><p>Kodachi shook her head. "No." She said. "Thank you but no. As it is said; I made my bed and I must lie in it."</p><p>End Chapter 4</p><p>Authors Notes: Kind of a Lime-ish chapter, but fun.
