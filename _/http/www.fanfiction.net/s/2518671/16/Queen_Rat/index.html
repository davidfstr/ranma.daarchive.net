</div><p>Epilogue</p><p>'To forgive'</p><p>Akane sat on the edge of the roof of Nabiki's apartment building and stared at the evening sky. She felt more than heard someone approach. "Hey Ranma." She said without turning around. Ranma sat down on the ledge next to Akane. "Well we got them."</p><p>"Yeah." Ranma responded. "I thought it was nice of Noriudo to let it go." He said. "I thought for sure he'd send us back to prison." He elbowed Akane gently. "Maybe we coulda gotten our old cell back."</p><p>Akane shuddered slightly. "Please Ranma, don't joke about that, okay?"</p><p>Ranma looked over at Akane. "Are you still planning to kill yourself?" He asked quietly.</p><p>Akane turned her head away. "How long have you known?" She asked tiredly.</p><p>"Since almost the beginning. You were too," Ranma smiled. "Accommodating. My Tomboy,"</p><p>"Please don't call me that Ranma." Akane pleaded. "I don't deserve to be called that."</p><p>"My Tomboy would have tried launching me into orbit." Ranma continued. "I watched you fight your temper no matter how much I humiliated you." He snorted. "Yeah Tomboy, everything I did, I did because I was angry with you. I wanted to hurt you the way you hurt me. I wanted to hurt Ukyo as well. The two of you treated me like a thing. A possession. Your 'get out of gay free' card." Ranma paused for a second. "It hurt Tomboy." Ranma put his hand on Akane's shoulder. "Don't." He said firmly.</p><p>Akane shrugged Ranma's hand away and stood. She turned away from Ranma, wrapped her arms around herself and looked down at her feet. "I raped you Ranma." Akane said in a choked voice. "Nothing I could do could ever make up for that. No humiliation would have been enough." She swallowed. "I wanted to wait until we finished this."</p><p>Ranma spun Akane to face him. "Tomboy; listen to me." Ranma said firmly. "I won't permit it. If I have to tie you up and make you spend the rest of your life in a straight jacket I will." Ranma placed a hand over Akane's mouth. "Shut up." He said. "I'm not joking Tomboy."</p><p>Akane pulled Ranma's hand away. "Please Ranma." Sobbed Akane. "I can't live with this."</p><p>"No." Ranma replied.</p><p>"How can I make you understand?" Screamed Akane. "I raped you." She shouted hysterically. "If you had done it to me, you'd be dead. Dead." She began to beat Ranma on the chest with her fists. "And what do you do?" She whimpered. "You forgive me." Akane sank to her knees in front of Ranma. "How can you forgive me?" She sobbed brokenly.</p><p>Ranma knelt down to face Akane. "I almost didn't." Ranma lifted Akane's chin with one finger. "I almost didn't forgive Ukyo either." Ranma smiled sourly. "You may have been the one who did it,"</p><p>"But I was the one that lit the fuse." Ukyo walked out of the shadows and sank to the rooftop next to Akane. "Finally figured out the Umisenken." She said apologetically. "I was practicing on Akane when you came out. I heard most of it." Ukyo wiped at her eyes. "Shit; if I hadn't gotten shot I think the three of us would be dead by now." Ukyo shook her head sadly. "I am one class 'A' jerk." Ukyo blew out a breath. "Akane honey, if you were planning what I think you were planning; don't. Or be prepared to have me follow you." Ukyo leaned toward Akane. "And I would too." She said in a dead serious voice. "I will not allow you to out noble me."</p><p>"But Ukyo."</p><p>"No 'buts' Akane. If you're guilty then so am I." Ukyo cut her off. She jabbed herself in the chest. "I was the one who pushed you." She said angrily. "Me." She looked at Ranma. Ranma nodded in both agreement and approval. Ukyo turned back to Akane. "Now you get up from this roof and keep fighting me for Ranma or so help me." The side of Ukyo's mouth twisted up in a wry grin. "Someone's gotta make sure I'm treating him right."</p><p>"Yeah?" Akane shot back. "And who's gonna make sure I'm treating Ranma right? You?"</p><p>Ukyo grinned. "Sure. Why not?"</p><p>Akane snorted. "Jerk," She muttered. Akane wiped her face then took a deep breath, held it for a second, and then let it out slowly. She stood up. Ranma and Ukyo followed. They watched her carefully. Suddenly Akane hiccoughed a laugh. "I just realized something." She said shakily. "We still have the old ghoul and Shampoo to deal with." She looked at Ranma and Ukyo sheepishly. "Tell you what. I'll ask again after we take care of them."</p><p>Ranma smiled and put an arm around Akane's waist. "Okay Tomboy." Ranma then put his other arm around Ukyo's waist. "Just like old times huh?" Ranma said as he led the two girls to the stairs.</p><p>"Just like Ran-chan." Ukyo agreed.</p><p>Akane nodded. "Yeah." She sighed in contentment. "Just like old times."</p><p>Author's note; I should have posted this as part of Chapter 15. I don't know why I didn't. Sooo, rather than post such a short chapter alone. I give you a second chapter. A side story.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>'Laissez Bon Temp Rollez'<p>A Queen Rat side story (sorta)</p><p>Akane and Ukyo opened the front door of the apartment they shared with Ranma. "We're home." They called. Ranma came out of the small kitchen. He was wearing pajama bottoms and a long robe. "Hey Ranma." Akane called cheerfully.</p><p>"Hey Tomboy." Ranma replied. "Hey Uk-chan." He smiled slightly. "How was work?"</p><p>"Not bad." Ukyo replied. Ukyo reached into the shoulder pocket of her Big Daddy suit and pulled out her wallet. "They were really throwing the money around tonight. Too bad you weren't there." She pulled out a wad of cash and handed it to Ranma.</p><p>"Hey I needed a night off." Ranma replied. He counted the money. Ranma's eyebrow rose. "Damn, they were throwing it around." Ranma walked over to a bookcase and opened the lid of a jar there. He pulled out a large roll of bills from the jar and added the new bills and returned the now larger roll of bills to the jar and covered it. "Better get to the bank soon." He said.</p><p>"I'm taking a shower." Akane announced. She marched off to the bed room. She emerged a minute later wrapped in a towel and went into the small shower that was just next to the bedroom.</p><p>"Don't use up all the hot water." Ukyo called after her. She turned back to Ranma. "So what did you do on your night off?" She asked. "Let me guess. You slept, ate, worked out, ate again and slept some more." She said teasingly.</p><p>"I think I ate three times." Ranma replied. "Nah, I took a walk."</p><p>"A walk?" Ukyo asked. "Where'd you go?"</p><p>"Nowhere really. Just around." Ranma replied. "It's kind of funny but I don't remember the last time I just walked." He smiled at Ukyo. "Wanna sleep in my room tonight?" He asked.</p><p>Ukyo grinned. "I'd love to." She replied. "Let me check with Akane." Ukyo ran off to the bedroom for a moment then emerged wrapped in a towel and headed for the bathroom. She knocked. "It's me." Ukyo walked in. "Man save me some hot water." She said as she waved the steam away from her face. "Hey Akane, Ranma asked if I wanted to sleep in his room tonight. Is that okay?"</p><p>The water turned off. The shower door slid open and Akane's arm reached out and snagged the towel and disappeared back into the shower. A moment later a towel wrapped Akane opened the shower door. "Tonight huh?" She said. "I don't know." She trailed off.</p><p>"It's been over a week Akane." Ukyo said in annoyance. "Come on."</p><p>Akane snorted. "Oh like I could really say no. Yeah go ahead." She said in irritation. "I wish he'd take away that stupid rule."</p><p>"I don't know sugar." Ukyo replied. Akane looked over at Ukyo in surprise. "Oh I don't really like asking."</p><p>"Neither do I." Akane replied.</p><p>"Yeah, but this way, I don't know how to explain it sugar, but this way seems more honest." Ukyo walked over to the shower and turned it back on. "It sucks. It hurts sometimes. Yet, somehow it just seems to be the right thing to do." Ukyo removed the towel and hung it up. "It's either this or giving up Ranma."</p><p>"One of us is going to have to give him up eventually Ukyo." Akane replied. "Heck, we both may have to give him up."</p><p>"I know that Akane." Ukyo stepped into the shower. "When the time comes." She agreed. "The time hasn't come yet." She looked at Akane. "Has it?"</p><p>Akane gave her head a little shake. "No." She admitted. "It hasn't." Akane sighed. "Try not to make too much noise."</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "Depends on where Ranma aims tonight." She closed the shower door.</p><p>Akane snorted and walked out of the shower. Ranma was sitting on the couch watching television. "Hey Ranma." She called. When Ranma turned his head toward her Akane unwrapped the towel and flashed him. She grinned when Ranma gave a low whistle of approval. "Try not to think about this when you're with Ukyo tonight." She said.</p><p>"That's mean Tomboy." Ranma replied with a grin.</p><p>Akane wrapped the towel around herself again. "Good." She said. She walked over to Ranma and kissed him on the cheek. She shrieked when Ranma pulled her on to his lap. "Hey I thought you were gonna sleep with Ukyo tonight?"</p><p>"I am." Ranma replied. Ranma pressed his lips against Akane's. Akane's lips parted and let Ranma's tongue explore her lips, her teeth and her tongue. His hand gently caressed her breast through the towel, Ranma broke the kiss. "Try not thinking about me tonight." Ranma whispered against her mouth.</p><p>"Meanie." Akane replied. Akane hopped off Ranma's lap and walked away. She turned as she reached her bedroom door, stuck out her tongue at him and walked into the room. Ranma could hear her laugh as the door closed.</p><p>Ranma stood up and stretched, then walked into his bedroom. He took off the robe and got into bed. Ranma lay back crossed his arms behind his head and pillowed his head on his arms and waited. The door opened and Ukyo walked in. She was wearing a pair of light blue silk pajamas. "Hey I remember those." Ranma said after a moment. "Our first time, right?"</p><p>Ukyo smiled happily. "You remembered." She said in a pleased tone of voice. She walked over to the bed and got in under the covers with Ranma. "Yeah." She said. "Umm." Ranma wrapped an arm around her and pulled her close. "I could stay like this for hours."</p><p>"If that's what you want." Ranma replied.</p><p>Ukyo chuckled. "You would too. Maybe another time." She smiled against Ranma's chest. "I remember that night." She said. "You and Akane had a fight." She turned her head until she was looking up at Ranma. "And you came to me."</p><p>"Who else would I have gone to Uk-chan?" Ranma replied.</p><p>Ukyo smiled up at Ranma. "Yeah, but that was the first time you had asked to stay the night. In my bed." Ukyo sighed happily. "Gods I'm so glad I said yes." She laughed. "Neither one of us had any idea of what we were supposed to do." Ranma chuckled in nostalgic agreement. "I never laughed so hard in my life." Ukyo continued.</p><p>"You stopped laughing once I finally figured out what to do." Ranma said in reminder. Ranma sighed. "But you never stopped smiling."</p><p>Ukyo cuddled closer to Ranma. "That was a good time."</p><p>Akane sat cross-legged on her futon. Her hands rested on her knees. Her eyes were closed and her breaths were deep and even. Her meditation was interrupted by the sound of laughter coming from Ranma's room. Akane sighed and resumed her breathing exercises. "This is not going to be easy." She muttered to herself as another burst of laughter interrupted her concentration. She got to her feet and threw on a robe and put on her slippers. A minute later Akane stood on the roof of the apartment building. She looked up at the night sky. "I guess I could have moved back home." Akane said to the night sky. "I guess I could give Ranma up. It's not like either one of us really has a chance any more." Akane sighed. "So why don't I?"</p><p>Akane moved to the center of the roof and started going through a form. 'This was the first kata Ranma showed me.' Akane thought as she went through the postures. 'That was a good time.' Akane flowed from one posture to another with effortless grace. 'Then I had to lose my stupid temper.' Akane stopped and hung her head. "Stupid Akane. Can't you ever learn to control your temper?" She whispered to the rooftop. Akane looked up suddenly. "I gotta run."</p><p>Akane kicked off her slippers and her robe and raced to the edge of the roof and launched herself into space. She tucked into a ball and then unwound herself just as her feet touched the roof of the apartment building next to theirs. She bounced into the air. Akane bounced from rooftop to rooftop. She back flipped across roofs. She cart-wheeled across roofs. Akane ran across the rooftops.</p><p>After awhile Akane began to smile. "Just like old times." The Nerima Wrecking Crew had become a common sight in the Nerima night. They; Akane, Ranma, Ukyo always ran together. Sometimes Mousse and Shampoo would join them. Not often, Akane didn't trust Shampoo out of her sight. Especially since Shampoo would never pass up the opportunity to eliminate one fiancé one way or another. Akane found herself teaming up with Ukyo more often than not, since there were a lot of lines Ukyo would not cross, in defense against Shampoo. 'At least I knew she wouldn't try killing me when my back was turned.'</p><p>Sometimes Ryoga would join them. If the idiot didn't get lost in the first ten minutes he usually was good for the rest of the evening. Akane admitted a bit of interest in Ryoga but as long as Ranma was around Ryoga barely appeared on her mental map. She knew he had a crush on her, but Akane had tried not to encourage him. Besides, there was something about Ryoga that bothered her. Maybe it was a look that sometimes appeared in his eyes when he looked at her. Like he had a secret, that he knew something. About her. Akane wasn't sure what it was but it bothered her.</p><p>Akane knew that Tatewaki and Kodachi were also considered members of the Wrecking Crew. In a way they were. They caused enough damage to qualify. The only times they ever ran with them was when one or the other was in trouble.</p><p>Sometimes a wannabe martial artist would join them. Some were actually pretty good. Sometimes they'd come by the dojo when they were living there and ask to train with Ranma. Some Ranma even invited back.</p><p>But, in the end, it was Ranma and Akane, leaving the dojo around midnight. They'd head for Uk-chan's and see if Ukyo was up for a run or not. Most of the time she said yes. 'But sometimes it was just you and me Ranma.' Akane stopped on the next rooftop. Her shoulders heaved from both sorrow and a lack of oxygen. "And here I am running alone. Way to go Akane." She scolded herself. She looked around. "I need something to hit." She decided. Akane looked over the side of the building. She snorted. "Now if a girl in her pajamas can't get attention here," She said. Akane started climbing down the side of the building. She quickly jumped from window ledge to window ledge until she reached the ground. Akane started walking in the general direction back toward the apartment.</p><p>Akane walked along for nearly ten minutes before she was accosted. Two men walked out from the shadows as she passed an alley way. An arm sneaked around her throat. Akane felt the edge of a knife pressed against her throat. As the two men pulled Akane into the alleyway the darkness hid her smile.</p><p>Akane was pushed against the side of the alleyway and she felt the man's hand start pulling her pajamas down. His hot breath stank of alcohol and cigarettes. Akane waited until she felt the man's sex press against her before she acted. First there was a flare of light from Akane's hands. The sudden brightness stunned the two men momentarily. Akane hand came up and grabbed the hand with the knife. The man screamed from both the pain from Akane's grip and the sudden burst of heat that came from Akane's hands.</p><p>Akane pulled her pajama bottoms up. "This is not your lucky night." Akane said in an almost cheerful tone. "I need to work off some steam and you boys are elected to help me do that." Akane rushed forward and grabbed the two men and tossed them deeper into the alley. "I've been having a shitty year. My fiance is fucking my girlfriend." Akane said as she stalked toward the men. She picked one up by the front of his shirt and lifted him into the air. "He makes me watch sometimes." She said. Akane tossed the man against the wall and turned to the other attacker. "Guess how that makes me feel?"</p><p>Akane flowed toward the man. She breezed through his attempted block and slapped the man. "He makes her ask me if it's alright if she fucks him." She slapped the man again and again. Not hard slaps, but even light slaps done at Chestnut Fist speed can hurt. "And she fucking asks. She fucking asks."</p><p>"Please lady stop." Gasped the man. Akane tossed the man to the ground. "Wimp." She said. She looked over to the first man. He had just pulled himself to his feet and looked like he was about to charge her. "Ooh." Breathed Akane. "Someone thinks he's a real man."</p><p>"Shut up bitch." The man snarled. He rushed Akane with his arms stretched out to the side. He closed his arms on nothing. The man spun around. Akane was standing behind him. Akane turned and pulled down her pajama bottoms for a second.</p><p>"Take a look at what you'll never be man enough to have, little man." She pulled the pajamas back up. Akane laughed. "Never be woman enough either for that matter." Akane waved her hands at the man. "Go home little man before you get hurt."</p><p>"Shut up bitch." Repeated the man angrily. "No one talks to me like that."</p><p>"No?" Akane arched an eyebrow. "Maybe it's time one did." She marched over to the man. He threw a punch but Akane just blocked it with a flick of her hand. She backhanded the man across the face. "You're not a man." She said in disgust. "A real man doesn't lurk in the night and pull helpless girls into a dark alley." Akane picked the thug up and slapped him repeatedly. The she shoved the man against the wall. She spun the man around to face the wall and pulled down his trousers. "How does it feel?" She snarled. Akane shoved the man's body hard against the wall. "I could shove my fist up your ass right now and there'd be nothing you could do about it." She felt the man strain against the wall but Akane held him fast to the wall. "The only thing stopping me is you'd probably enjoy it." She leaned her body against the man. "How does it feel?" She whispered into the man's ear. "To be helpless." Akane pressed the man's face into the wall until he screamed in pain.</p><p>A flashing red light illuminated the alley. Two policemen ran into the alley to find two unconscious men on the ground. One had his pants around his ankles. The shone their flashlights into the alley but they couldn't find anyone else around.</p><p>Akane ran along the rooftops and back toward the apartment. She entered in through the living room window. She was walking quietly toward her bedroom when Ranma's bedroom door opened.</p><p>"Oh good, you're home." Said Ukyo. "Where're your slippers?"</p><p>Akane looked down at her bare and dirty feet. "I guess I forgot them on the roof." Akane replied sheepishly.</p><p>"Well wash your feet and come to bed." Ukyo said. She pointed into Ranma's room with her thumb. "Ranma was worried about you."</p><p>"Besides the feet I'm kind of sweaty right now." Akane said.</p><p>"So are we." Ukyo replied with a slight smile. "Come on, we're both too tired to do anything else. Besides, if you don't come in here, I know Ranma is going to go to your futon later, so let's just eliminate the bullshit. Wash your feet and come to bed. Okay?"</p><p>"Okay Ukyo." Akane replied in resignation. She walked into the bathroom and washed her feet and wiped off some of the sweat. She sighed then walked into Ranma's room.</p><p>"Hey Tomboy." Ranma called. He lifted the covers of his futon. "Get in." Akane smiled slightly and got into the bed with Ranma and Ukyo though she turned away from them. Ranma turned and put an arm around Akane. "How was your run?" He asked</p><p>"Boring." Akane said. "The jerks in this town are pathetic." She heard both Ranma and Ukyo chuckle.</p><p>"Tell you what." Ranma said. "We'll spar an extra half hour tomorrow."</p><p>"I'd like that Ranma." Akane replied. Akane chewed her lip. "Sorry for not watching your back but," Akane sighed. "I really couldn't stay here." She heard a murmur of understanding from both Ranma and Ukyo. "How long would have waited before you came looking for me?" She asked.</p><p>"Another hour or so." Ukyo replied. "Next time take your cell phone." Ukyo yawned.</p><p>Akane snorted. "Yes Mother." Akane turned in the circle of Ranma's arms. She looked into Ranma's face. Concern was there, even affection and he was sleepy. Akane smiled slightly. "Nite Ranma." She said. "Nite Ukyo."</p><p>"Nite sugar." Ukyo replied. She cuddled up against Ranma's back. "Nite Ran-chan."</p><p>"Nite Uk-chan. Nite Tomboy." Ranma replied. He pulled Akane closer and closed his eyes.</p><p>Akane watched Ranma's face as he fell asleep. 'He still worries about me.' She realized. "I may have to give you up one day." She whispered. "But not right now." Akane closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p><p>The next morning after a morning spar, followed by a leisurely breakfast, the three were sitting in the main living area of the apartment. Ranma walked over to a shelf and picked up the cookie jar. He carried it over to the table and emptied the contents on to the table. Ranma pushed the money toward Ukyo. "How are we doing?" He asked.</p><p>Ukyo reached into the cookie jar and pulled out a bank statement. Ukyo quickly counted the money jotted a few numbers down on the statement and made a few calculations. "Not bad." She said finally. "Even without the money Noriudo was giving us, we can stay here as long as we like."</p><p>"Why are we still here?" Akane asked. "We got the pardon. We got revenge for both Ukyo and Kimi. Why are we still here?"</p><p>"You wanna go home Tomboy?" Ranma asked in surprise.</p><p>"Yes!" Akane exclaimed. Then her shoulders slumped. "No. I can't go home anymore."</p><p>"Why not hon?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Because it's all changed. I've changed." Akane sighed moodily. "I'm not the same person anymore. I've done things I never thought I was capable of." Akane sighed again. "I don't think I like me very much right now." She turned away slightly from Ranma and Ukyo. "Don't worry I'm not planning on doing anything."</p><p>"That's good." Ranma said seriously.</p><p>A brief smile came to Akane's face. It faded quickly. "Home is," Akane waved her hands helplessly. "Home is being Daddy's little girl. Home is Kasumi making dinner. Home is Nabiki making deals." Akane slumped. "Home is Ranma and Akane." Akane stood and walked to face the one large window in the apartment. "Would you move back home, Ranma?" She asked wistfully.</p><p>"Not right now Tomboy." Ranma replied. "I like having my own place, my own things." He smiled. "My own money."</p><p>Akane nodded without turning her head. "How about you Ukyo?' Akane asked. "You still have Uk-chan's." She said. "You already had your own place, your own things, and your own money. Why are you still here?"</p><p>"You know why Akane." Ukyo replied. "Ranma." Ukyo sighed. "And if you want to really know the truth, a little bit because of you too." Akane turned around. "I worry about you hon." Ukyo said. "Well I do."</p><p>"Thanks Ukyo." Akane said seriously. Akane turned back to the window. "Can we go for a run tonight?' She asked quietly. "The three of us."</p><p>"Still need something to hit huh Tomboy?" Asked Ranma. Ranma stood up and walked to stand behind Akane. He put his arms around her. Akane stiffened slightly for a moment then relaxed against Ranma. "Sure. Whatever you want." Ranma said.</p><p>"That's my line." Akane smiled slightly.</p><p>Ukyo stood. "Tell you what." She said. "I'll take the money to the bank. Maybe do a little grocery shopping." She looked at her watch. "That should take a couple hours."</p><p>"Take your phone." Akane said. "Shampoo and the old ghoul are still out there."</p><p>"Yes Mother." Ukyo replied. "See you guys later." Ukyo picked up her spatula and slung it across her back. She walked out of the apartment.</p><p>Akane waited for the sound of the lock before turning in Ranma's arms. She laid her head against this chest and listened to the slow steady thump of his heart. "Sorry for being so moody." She said after a long moment. "It's just,"</p><p>"I know Tomboy." Ranma replied. "Tonight we'll go out for a run. If we're lucky we'll run into some jerks for you to hit." He rested his chin lightly on top of Akane's head. "Whaddaya wanna do until Uk-chan gets home?" He smiled. "We could just cuddle."</p><p>"Cuddling is the last thing on my mind right now." Akane said almost angrily. "I-I don't deserve you being so nice." Akane's hand came up and made a fist. She beat it against Ranma's chest. Once. She laid her fist against Ranma's chest, right next to her face. "I don't want you to be so nice." Her fist tightened. "Be rough Ranma." She begged. "Show me what it felt like. Please Ranma."</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "You know even I wouldn't say something that stupid." Ranma shook his head again. "However," Akane shrieked in surprise when Ranma scooped her in his arms. She shrieked again when Ranma tossed her into the air. Akane's reflexes made her try to control her short flight but before she could right herself she felt herself being grabbed. The next thing Akane knew she was face down and sprawled across Ranma's lap. Akane tried to get up but found herself being prevented by Ranma. Akane began to struggle. She yelped in surprise when she felt the palm of Ranma's hand slap her butt.</p><p>"Ow. Hey! That hurts. Ow." Akane exclaimed angrily. "What? Ow." She yelled again. "Ranma what are you doing? Ow."</p><p>"Giving you the spanking you deserve." Ranma said cheerfully,.</p><p>"Spanking? Ow." Akane exclaimed. "Stop. Ow." Akane began to struggle harder. "Ow. Stop it Ranma. Ow." Akane struggled harder. "Jerk. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow."</p><p>"What was that last one?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Jerk." Akane replied angrily. "Ow." She turned her head to look at Ranma over her shoulder. "Jerk. Jerk. Jerk. Jerk. Jerk." She said in a rapid staccato. "What are you laughing at?"</p><p>"Welcome back Tomboy." Ranma laughed. Ranma caressed Akane's ass cheek gently. "You were right." He said in mock surprise. "Hitting you does get your attention quicker."</p><p>Akane snorted. "Told ya." She glared at Ranma. "Jerk. Ow." Akane jumped as Ranma spanked her again. "Okay. Okay. You got my attention." She rubbed her butt. "I'm going to have a bruise."</p><p>"Blame Big Daddy." Ranma chuckled. "It'll be good for his rep." Ranma turned Akane around so she was now sitting on Ranma's lap. "Feeling better?" He asked. He smiled when Akane nodded. "Well now I know how to get you out of your bad moods." Akane thumped his chest with her fist. Ranma laughed. "That's my Tomboy."</p><p>"I still don't like sharing you with Ukyo." Akane grumped. Ranma stood up taking Akane with him. He walked over to the door to his bedroom and kicked it open. Ranma placed Akane on the bed and lay down next to her. Akane rolled over to look at Ranma. "You know it would serve you right if we both stopped sleeping with you." She started to remove her clothes.</p><p>Ranma smiled as he helped Akane remove her blouse. "So why don't ya?' Ranma asked. He removed his pants. Leaving him only in his boxers. He unhooked Akane's bra. She tossed it to the side. The two of them lay down on the bed. Ranma traced the curve of Akane's jaw with a finger. "I'm not promising either of you anything. You know." His hand started to caress Akane's body.</p><p>"At least you're honest about it." Akane muttered. "I know Ranma." Akane replied in a stronger voice. "I belong here Ranma. With you." She smiled slightly. "Gods help me, even with Ukyo." Akane closed her eyes and focused on the feel of Ranma's hand. A contented smile came to her face. "Ranma?"</p><p>"Yeah Tomboy?"</p><p>"Why are we still talking?" She asked. Akane opened her eyes and looked at Ranma longingly.</p><p>"Beats the hell outta me Tomboy." Ranma laughed.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kimi watched Nabiki with concern. Ever since they broke the drug smuggling ring Nabiki had thrown herself into money making schemes. She was doing very well but she was moody and irritable. 'Hit you harder than you want to admit, didn't it girlfriend?' Kimi thought. 'It's one thing to pretend to be a whore; it's another to actually be one.' Right now Nabiki was sitting at her computer working on something. Her blond wig was sitting on its head shaped stand next to the computer, exposing her close cut black hair.<p>Nabiki didn't look up from the computer as Kimi stood and walked into the bedroom. She didn't look up when Kimi returned a few minutes later. Kimi picked up a magazine and began reading. She had nearly finished reading it when the doorbell rang. Nabiki looked up in annoyance. "Who the hell could that be?" She grumbled.</p><p>"You answer it." Kimi said. "I'm busy." She pointedly looked at her magazine.</p><p>Nabiki rolled her eyes. She turned off her computer and stood.</p><p>"Wig." Kimi said without looking up.</p><p>Nabiki grabbed the wig and placed it on her head just as the doorbell rang again. "Coming." She yelled. She walked over to the door as she adjusted the wig. Nabiki sighed and opened the door a crack. "Yes?" She said irritably.</p><p>"Pardon." Came a masculine voice. "I was asked to come here." The voice said. "Mayhaps I misunderstood."</p><p>"Tatewaki?" Nabiki exclaimed in surprise. She opened the door wider. "Asked?" She turned into the room. "Su?"</p><p>Kimi looked up from her magazine. "Well invite him in." She instructed. She stood. "You'll have to forgive Mari." Kimi said as she walked over to the door. "She's been moody lately." She explained as she elbowed the stunned looking Nabiki out of the way. "I thought she'd like seeing a friendly face." She smiled. "Me too for that matter."</p><p>Tatewaki entered the apartment. "I needs admit your call came as a surprise." He said as he walked in. "A pleasant one, but a surprise nonetheless." He sat down on the couch and was immediately flanked by Kimi and Nabiki. He looked at Nabiki. "Moody?" He inquired.</p><p>Nabiki shrugged. "It's been a bad past few weeks." She admitted. 'Gods I missed him.' Nabiki blinked internally. 'Damn I really did miss him.'</p><p>"Indeed." Tatewaki looked at Kimi. "And you felt I could do something about it?" He asked Kimi. She nodded. "I'm flattered." Tatewaki said truthfully.</p><p>'You should be.' Kimi thought. She smiled. "You're just what the doctor ordered Tatewaki."</p><p>"Indeed?" Tatewaki leaned back against the couch and raised his arms. Both Nabiki and Kimi cuddled close. "Well I shall endeavor to do my best." He said with a smile. "I'm actually very glad you called, I have a new fantasy."</p><p>"Oh?" Nabiki leaned away from Tatewaki. "And what would this new fantasy be?"</p><p>"There are these two women I met." Tatewaki said with a touch of embarrassment. "By all outward measures they," Tatewaki ducked his head slightly. "Are inappropriate. At least for me." Tatewaki laughed quietly. "Yet I find that when they call I rush over." He pulled the two women closer. "In my life I never met two women quite like them. They are women among women."</p><p>"And what are the names of these two paragons?" Kimi asked with a grin.</p><p>Tatewaki sighed. "They tell me their names are Mari and Su." He replied.</p><p>"Good answer." Nabiki laughed. "You know that girl in high school that thought you were a fool?" Nabiki said with a wry smile. "As far as I'm concerned; she was the fool." She leaned against Tatewaki with a sigh.</p><p>"Nay." Tatewaki replied seriously. "She was right." Tatewaki looked down at Nabiki. "She was always right." Tatewaki chuckled. "You remind me much of her except you are kind."</p><p>"Anyone ever tell you, you talk too much." Nabiki said huskily. "Now shut up and kiss me." Nabiki demanded.</p><p>Tatewaki woke in the middle of the night and extricated himself from the twin embrace of the two women. He went to the bathroom and when he returned he carefully got back into the bed to avoid waking the two women. The two women shifted in their sleep until they were both wrapped around Tatewaki. Tatewaki looked at the women he knew as Mari. "I know not why you pretend to be someone and something you are not Nabiki Tendo but I shall not embarrass you by revealing I know." He said quietly. "And I will always be grateful." Tatewaki fell asleep.</p><p>Author's Notes: Dedicated to the victims of Katrina.</p>
