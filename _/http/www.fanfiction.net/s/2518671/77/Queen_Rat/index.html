</div><p>Chapter 3</p><p>'Party Girls'</p><p>The party the next day was like all parties Kiko had at the mansion. A pack of giggling girls descended on the mansion and by early afternoon the party was in full swing. Since it was early April, it still was too cold for swimming but warm enough that most of the teen and pre-teen girls were in shorts. It was apparent, to Pema and Kagomi, that Kiko wasn't the only girl who no longer considered themselves 'babies' and those girls who's breasts were budding wore, much to Kiko's chagrin and envy, blouses that did much to draw attention to their newfound shape.</p><p>"Good thing there no boys here." Pema said to Kagomi with a giggle.</p><p>"Good thing." Agreed Kagomi. "There are way too many places for someone to hide in the mansion." She shuddered. "And some of Kiko's friends look like they can't wait to go hide with the first cute boy that says hello." She smiled wryly. "Hell, I couldn't wait when I was around Kiko's age." Pema looked up as one of Kiko's friends walked over. "Hello, Mitsuki."</p><p>"Hi Pema, Hi Kagomi." Mitsuki replied. As Kiko had intimated, Mitsuki was already developing a bust and was one of the girls flaunting the fact. Like most of the girls she was wearing shorts and a blouse that was unbuttoned enough to slightly reveal the edge of the blue bra she was wearing. She sat down next to Pema and leaned back on her hands. Mitsuki didn't say anything at first but it was apparent to Pema and Kagomi that the young girl was working up the nerve to say something. Pema and Kagomi each raised an eyebrow and looked at each other but said nothing. "Ca-can I ask you guys a...a question?" She asked finally.</p><p>"Of course you can, Mitsuki." Kagomi replied.</p><p>"Well..you see...there's this...friend of mine." Mitsuki began hesitantly. "An-and she's got this older brother." Mitsuki blushed. "An-and anyway I, I mean my friend, walked into his room and he was with his...girlfriend, I guess, and they were..." She broke off. "Touching." She whispered.</p><p>"Nothing wrong with touching." Kagomi said with a smile.</p><p>"Bu-but she was touching his...his..." She pointed downward. "And it was..." She broke of with a blush. She looked down. "It made me feel...funny and I sort of...watched for awhile." She said. Then my brother, I mean my friend's brother yelled at me to leave."</p><p>"That's good." Muttered Kagomi. "It's okay. Mitsuki, really."</p><p>"Listen to Kagomi." Pema said in support.</p><p>"Is that what boys and girls do?" Mitsuki asked in tone that combined plaintiveness and eagerness."</p><p>"Well, if they like each other, yeah." Kagomi said.</p><p>"But only if you say it okay." Pema said firmly. "You must give...Kagomi, what word?"</p><p>"Permission?" Supplied Kagomi.</p><p>"Permission, yes." Pema said. "One day you find boy." She said with a gentle smile. "And boy, cute." She said cheerfully. Mitsuki giggled. "Boy so cute you want touch all over." Pema said. Mitsuki blushed. "And he want touch you." She added. "And if you say it okay." Mitsuki blushed even redder. "It okay." She said. "But touch only." She said firmly. "Okay?"</p><p>"Okay, Pema." Mitsuke replied. "Thanks." She smiled at Pema and Kagomi, stood and went back to the party.</p><p>"How much you want to bet we're going to get a lot of questions like that pretty soon?" Kagomi asked.</p><p>"Pema not want bet, she lose all money." Pema replied with a giggle. She sighed. "All this talk of touch...make me think of Ranma." She gave Kagomi a look. "It good thing Kagomi here."</p><p>"Uh oh." Kagomi replied in pretend alarm. "I'm in trouble now." She grinned. "Good thing." She and Pema giggled. Pema saw movement out of the corner of her eye and turned. "Oh, Ms. Kuno and Ms. Mata come." The two older women walked into the center of the party and was immediately greeted by Kiko. Pema and Kagomi stood and walked over.</p><p>Kodachi, with Kiko hanging on to her arm, and Noriko were standing in a loose cluster of young of the many Kuno retainers hurried over in case Kodachi needed something. "Good afternoon, ladies." Kodachi said in greeting. Noriko smiled a hello.</p><p>"Good Afternoon, Ms. Kuno. Ms. Mata." Pema and Kagomi replied in greeting.</p><p>"Noriko and I cannot stay too long." Kodachi said mostly to Kiko. "But something's come up." "Nothing serious, in fact quite the opposite." Kodachi smiled. "But it seems your mother has an...admirer at the club." She said with a bemused laugh. "And..." She began.</p><p>Kiko pumped a fist. "Yes." She said in excited approval. She looked at Kodachi. "Is he cute?" She asked. "Hey, is it the same man that mom dated last time?" She asked. "It's him, isn't it?" She said excitedly. "Is he nice?" She asked. "Please tell me he's nice." She begged.</p><p>"Slow down, sweetheart." Kodachi said with a laugh. "It's the girls' unanimous opinion that he's very cute." She said. "And yes, it's the same man."</p><p>"Yes." Kiko said happily.</p><p>"And yes, he seems very nice." Kodachi said. Kiko squealed happily. "Your mother wasn't sure how you'd take it." She said in amusement.</p><p>"Are you kidding?" Kiko exclaimed. "Mom deserves someone." She said firmly. "Someone nice, someone who can make her smile. He made her smile." She said in approval. "Is she with him now?" She asked. "I could call her and..."</p><p>"I don't think you should call your mom just yet, kiddo." Noriko said hiding a smile. "Give her, oh, a couple hours."</p><p>Kiko squealed in glee. "Really?" She asked.</p><p>"Really." Noriko replied. Kiko squealed again.</p><p>"Anyway..." Kodachi said in amused tones. "Your mother wondered if you wouldn't mind staying another night or two."</p><p>"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes." Kiko said in staccato approval.</p><p>"Of course that will depend on whether Pema and Kagomi can stay those extra days as well." Kodachi said in caution.</p><p>Kiko spun around. "Please Pema." Kiko begged. "Just a couple extra days?" She said. "For mom?"</p><p>Pema and Kagomi giggled. "Oh, I think it be okay." Pema said. "I call Ranma."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Good evening." The pretty bespectacled brunette said into the camera. "And welcome to Japan Tonight." She said. "I"m your host, Mitsui Oh, Saatchi Kato is on vacation for the rest of the month. She turned to another camera. "Hope you're having a good time Saatchi." She said. A picture appeared on the screen behind the reporter. "Well it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone but we now know that the mysterious Sumire is the latest of the equally mysterious Miss Nodoka's discoveries." A picture of Nodoka Satome with her face half concealed by a fan in the full geisha dress and makeup of a very senior Geisha appeared in the center of the screen for several seconds before the a second image this one of an extraordinarily beautiful woman shared the screen. "First there was Makoto." Another image flashed large on the screen of a woman in an irridescent gown and madeup to look almost birdlike with feathers woven into and strreaming down her ankle length black hair. "Then Raven." The images rearranged themselves on the screen with the image of Nodoka was above the images of Makoto and Rei. Another picture flashed, this one was a woman in violet. "And now Sumire." The reporter smiled. "Miss Nodoka was kind enough to sit with me for an interview earlier today." The reporter's smile was triumphant. "Exclusively on Japan Tonight." Her smile became more professional. "When we come back."</p><p>The director indicated it was clear and the reporter leaned back in her chair and blew out a breath. Her assistant ran over. "Problem, Ms. Oh?" The assistant asked. The reporter shook her head. "No, no problem." She said. "It's just that I'm beginning to realize how tough a job this really is." She laughed ruefully. "Saatchi made it look so easy."</p><p>"You're not doing too bad yourself, Ms. Oh." Her assistant said. "According to the latest numbers you're holding the audience." She said. "Well most of it." She added after a moment. "On the other hand, there's been a definite spike in your fan mail."</p><p>The reporter perked up. "Really?" She asked. The assistant nodded. "Anything good?' The reporter asked.</p><p>"Oh the usual marriage proposals." The assistant said with a laugh. "But the majority are guesses as to the identify of Sumire." She laughed again. "It's amazing how many people think it's Saatchi." The assistant snorted. "Yeah, right." She said in dismissal. "Saatchi? Come on. That cold fish?" She and the reporter laughed.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The next morning Pema and Kagomi joined Kiko for breakfast. They were halfway through breakfast when Kodachi and Noriko joined them. Kodachi waved for the three to remain seated when they made to stand. "Good morning, ladies." Kodachi said in slightly tired tones. She sat down and accepted a cup of tea from one of her retainers.</p><p>"Good morning." The three girls chorused in reply. Kiko looked at Kodachi with concern. "You look tired, Auntie."</p><p>"A long night, sweetheart." Kodachi replied. "It was unusually busy at the club."</p><p>"That's putting it mildly." Noriko said wryly. "Sumire is turning out to be one of the biggest draws the club has seen since Makoto." She sipped her coffee. "Ah." She breathed in appreciation.</p><p>"And Mitch positively enjoys watching Sumire flirt with the other guests." Kodachi added with a laugh.</p><p>"Enjoys it?" Noriko snorted in amusement. "She encourages it." She said. "Just so she can walk over and...interrupt." Noriko rolled her eyes. "I think people are starting to come to the club just so they can see the antics those two get up to."</p><p>"Is Sumire really that beautiful?" Kiko asked in breathless awe.</p><p>"It's not just that she's beautiful, though she is, Kiddo." Noriko replied. "But it's more...it's the whole Sumire persona." She reached over and tousled Kiko's hair. "Which your mother did a heck of a lot to help create." She smiled.</p><p>"Koko did an excellent job with her." Kodachi agreed. She looked at Kiko. "You should be proud of your mother."</p><p>"Oh, I am, Auntie." Kiko said seriously. "I've always been proud of Mom." She declared. "Even when..." Kiko looked down for a second. Kiko put a smile on her face and looked up. "I spoke to Mom last night." She said. "She was worried that she was ignoring me." She rolled her eyes. "Honestly Auntie, if there is one thing Mom doesn't do, is ignore me." She said..</p><p>"Of course not sweetheart." Kodachi agreed. "She's a good mother."</p><p>"The best." Agreed Kiko. She looked at her watch. "Oh poo." She stood. "Sorry Auntie, but I have to leave now if I don't want to be late to my lessons with Madame Demille." She gave Kodachi a quick hug and a kiss before hurrying away.</p><p>Kodachi watched Kiko leave with a bemused look on her face. "That's the first time I ever heard her worry about missing a class with Genvieve before." She laughed quietly. "Why when I was her age..." Kodachi paused. "When I was her age I was already a bitch."</p><p>"Someone needs to go back to bed and get a few more hours of sleep." Noriko said decisively. "No arguments, Dachi." She said sternly though fondly. "You're always cranky when you don't get enough sleep." She stood and pulled Kodachi to her feet. "Now be a good girl and go back to bed." She ordered. "I promise to wake you if something really important comes up." Noriko swatted Kodachi on her butt. "Go."</p><p>"Oh, I suppose it couldn't hurt." Kodachi admitted. She leaned over and kissed Noriko on the cheek then wandered away.</p><p>Noriko watched Kodachi walk away with a fond smile then turned to Pema and Kagomi, "Actually, I wanted her out of the way while I talked to you." She said to the teen girls. "Now that your both over eighteen it's time to start thinking about your future." She said. "You can't stay with Ranma forever, you know that, don't you?" Noriko sipped her coffee.</p><p>Pema and Kagomi exchanged a look. They turned back to Noriko. "Pema know." Pema said as Kagomi put a hand on her shoulder. "But Pema's life belong to Ranma." She said. "Pema only leave if Ranma say so."</p><p>"And you, Kagomi?" Noriko asked. She looked at the Japanese teen over the rim of her cup. "When do you leave?"</p><p>"When Pema goes." Kagomi replied firmly. "Why are you asking?"</p><p>"How would you girls like a job?" Noriko replied instead.</p><p>"Pema and Kagomi have job." Pema replied. "We Daddy's Girls." She said. "It our job...to visit those under Ranma protection." She said. "Let Ranma know who need help."</p><p>"And pick up their...insurance premiums." Kagomi added. She giggled. "Or deliver a picture or two." Kagomi giggled again and Pema joined her. "Not that it takes a lot of time each day." She tilted her head and looked at Noriko. "The Club?" She asked. Her smile widened when Noriko nodded. Kagomi turned to Pema. "Please?" She begged. "Just one night a week." She said. "Please?" She begged again.</p><p>Pema giggled and tapped Kagomi on the nose. "I ask Ranma." She promised. "Maybe two nights."</p><p>"Yes." Exclaimed Kagomi. Kagomi raised her hands in the air and started dancing in her seat. "Party time." She sang. "It's Party Time." She looked at Noriko. "When do we start?" She asked eagerly.</p><p>Noriko chuckled. "And here I thought I was going to have to try and convince you." She said.</p><p>"I not know why you think that, Ms. Mata." Pema replied. "We be at Club many, many times." She said. "We like Club."</p><p>"You just like it when men drool when they see you." Kagomi scolded with a giggle.</p><p>"When they see us." Pema corrected. Pema giggled. "I think we have good, good time."</p><p>"Oh yeah." Agreed Kagomi. "Look out world, here comes Jewel and Gem." Kagomi started dancing in her seat again and this time Pema joined her. "Party time. Party time." They sang. "Oh, we have to go shopping." Kagomi said suddenly. "We need new outfits."</p><p>"Ms. Kuno will give each of you one hundred thousand yen for new outfits." Noriko said with a laugh.</p><p>"Yes." Kagomi and Pema squealed.</p><p>"Koko will do your hair and make-up." Noriko said.</p><p>"Yes." Kagomi and Pema squealed again. "Oh we have to have a party." Kagomi said excitedly. She turned to Noriko. "Can we do that, Ms. Mata?" She asked. "Please."</p><p>"A party?" Noriko asked in surprise. Pema and Kagomi nodded eagerly. "You do know what goes on in the club, don't you?"</p><p>Pema and Kagomi giggled. "Oh yes, Ms. Mata." Pema replied. "We very much know." She shook her head. "We not do...that." She said. "Not without Ranma permission." She added. "But if Ranma say it okay..." She nodded. "But we be very, very...Kagomi, what word?"</p><p>"Picky?" Kagomi replied. "Hell yeah, we're gonna be very picky."</p><p>"A party, huh?" Noriko said. Pema and Kagomi nodded again. "Sure why not?" She said. Pema and Kagomi squealed.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kiko opened the door to the salon that Madame Demille conducted her lessons in deportment and etiquette. "Good morning, Madame Demille." Kiko said and bowed.</p><p>"Good morning, Miss Kiko." Madame Demille replied. "On time for once."</p><p>"Yes, Madam Demille." Kiko replied. "I...I apologize for my past tardiness, I hope to do better."</p><p>Madame Demille raised an eyebrow. "I see." She said. "Hope? Not a promise?" She asked.</p><p>Kiko shrugged in embarrassment. "I've not been very good at keeping my promises to you before." She replied. "Much as I intend to be better..." She shrugged again. "I thought it best not to make promises."</p><p>Madame Demille gave Kiko a rare smile of approval. "A well bred lady should always be sparing with promises." She said. "Sometimes the only thing a lady has, is her word." She said firmly. "Your word must have worth."</p><p>"Yes, Madame Demille." Kiko agreed.</p><p>Madame Demille gave Kiko a thoughtful look. The young girl was wearing what she normally would for her lessons with her. A short dress, black buckled shoes, white stockings. "Walk for me." She said suddenly. Without a word, Kiko started walking back and forth under Madame Demille's watchful eye. She nodded as if something became apparent to her. "Now, sit." Madame Demille pointed to a chair. "You're not comfortable." She declared.</p><p>Kiko grimaced. "No Madame Demille." She admitted. Kiko took a breath. "Can...can I speak to you about something?"</p><p>"Does it have to do with why you are not comfortable?" The deportment teacher asked. Kiko nodded. Madame Demille sat down in the chair next to Kiko's. Genvieve Demille had a very good idea what Kiko wanted to talk to her about. 'After all, what young lady wishes to be considered a child?' She thought. "I think we should have tea." She said. "Don't you?"</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hayato Fujitaro was a salaryman. Moderately successful, he was the manager of Paying and Receiving for a mid-sized retail bank in Toshima Ward. Married twenty years to the girl he met in college, two kids, girls aged twelve and ten. Every day he took the train from Bunkyo Ward to his job and was at his desk by eight thirty every morning. Every evening he'd accompany his boss and a dozen coworkers to one of a number of bars, restaurants or night clubs. He'd usually get home no later than eleven for a quick bath and an even quicker good night to his daughters but he'd usually make up for it as much as he could on weekends. It was a comfortable though boring rut.</p><p>Hayato looked at the clock and shut down his computer just as his boss got up from his desk and started walking down the row of desks populated by his subordinates. His coworkers got up from their desks and fell in behind. He stood to greet his boss with a short bow. "Mr. Tomohara." He said in greeting and took his place in the following group. Due to his position he moved close enough in case Mr. Tomohara wanted to speak to him. After picking up the last of the staff they took an elevator to the garage where a company shuttle bus waited. His company took care of their staff and made sure everyone got to and from wherever they went.</p><p>Now, most senior managers had a favorite, for lack of a better word, hangout and Mr. Tomohara was no different but he did occasionally like to try out a new place someone might have recommended. "Have you heard of the Purple Cat Lounge, Hayato?" Mr. Tomohara asked without turning his head.</p><p>"No, Mr. Tomohara." Hayato answered truthfully.</p><p>"Nobutetsu mentioned it in passing and I thought we'd give it a try." Mr. Tomohara replied. "Nobutetsu said the beer was good and the kitchen made excellent Ramen."</p><p>Hayato nodded slightly. He liked ramen. "Sounds nice, Mr. Tomohara."</p><p>Mr. Tomohara reached into his jacket and extracted a card. Without turning he passed it behind him and Hayato took the card. When they reached the van Hayato spoke briefly to the driver before entering the van himself and seating himself in the row just behind his boss. The van drove off.</p><p>While the bank was in Toshima ward the club was in the Kita Ward. Not a particularly long trip and Hayato was privately pleased that he wouldn't be too far from home when the evening ended. Some other evening jaunts went as far as Edogawa ward and Hayato never fully enjoyed them since he'd get home much later than normal when they did.</p><p>When the van pulled up to the club Hayato exited the van first and went to the door of the club. There was the expected burly bouncer though this one was, to Hayato's surprise, both female and, even more surprising, Chinese. Hayato fought down a surge of annoyance. 'Great, she probably can't speak proper Japanese.' He thought. "Good evening." He said aloud. "I with Mr. Tomohara, he have reservation. Understand?"</p><p>The woman snorted. "I understand perfectly well." She said in fluent Japanese. She picked up a clipboard that hung from the side of her stool. "Tomohara, Tomoha...ah, here it is." She said. "The reservation was for fifteen people." She said. "Is that correct?"</p><p>"Fourteen." Hayato corrected.</p><p>The woman made a note on her clipboard then counted the number of people that exited the van. She made another note on her clipboard. "You're a little early, but I believe your table is ready." She said directly to Mr. Tomohara. She opened the door and ushered the party into the club where they were met by a pretty waitress. Japanese, Hayato noted with some relief. The waitress led them to a large table near a corner.</p><p>"Beer?" The waitress asked. "We have Sapporo, Kirin, Heinikin and Fosters." All thirteen subordinates turned to Mr. Tomohara. "Sapporo." Grunted Mr. Tomohara. The waitress nodded and walked away. Mr. Tomohara picked up a menu sitting on the table in front of him and scanned the items. The rest of the party waited a moment before picking up their own menus. As Mr. Tomohara had indicated the majority of the dishes were ramen but there were a few others.</p><p>Hayato looked around the restaurant/night club. It seemed pretty typical to Hayato though he did raise an impressed eyebrow at the size of the sound system at the small stage. The decor was tasteful and the lighting muted but not dim. There was a definite Chinese overtone to the decor but, in Hayato's opinion, tailored to a Japanese sense of harmony. As he looked around he noticed there were a number of attractive women sitting at the bar. Most were Japanese, The one non-Japanese was a Chinese woman in her mid twenties with long purple hair who sprawled more than sat on a settee near the bar. And, while the Japanese women all wore tasteful evening dress or business attire, the lone Chinese woman wore a purple and red Chang Som whose tight bodice seemed hopelessly inadequate to hold the woman's large breasts. The high side slits made Hayato wonder if she were wearing underwear.</p><p>The Chiinese woman held a long thin pipe in one hand that she would take the occasional and langorous puff. As if she were aware of Hayato's scrutiny she slowly turned her head and looked directly at Hayato. She gave him a long and appraising look before turning her head away though not before her expression became one of amused dismissal. For some reason Hayato found himself more relieved then insulted.</p><p>The waitress returned interrupting Hayato's thoughts and forcing him to return his attention to the table and, of course, Mr. Tomohara. She placed several large bottles of Sapporo beer on the table and then went around the table taking dinner orders. Hayato ordered a seafood ramen that sounded interesting.</p><p>The evening went pretty much as Hayato expected. Mr. Tomohara drank just enough to become convivial, several of his coworkers got up and sang karaoke. Badly. And Hayato allowed himself to become nicely but not overly inebriated.</p><p>It was a little after ten and Hayato and his coworkers were beginning to wind down when the door to the club opened and three people walked man was tall and powerfully built and dressed all in white. White suit, white shoes and white fedora. A long queue hung down the middle of his broad back. He was flanked by two women. One dressed in a formfitting and low cut blue dress that showed off broad muscled shoulders and even more cleavage. The blue seemed to be reflected off her shiny short black hair. The other woman had long brown hair and wore a red slit dress that showed off shapely legs and while her gown was not low cut it did emphasize her firm breasts. It was not Hayato's imagination that the entire club immediately quieted. All eyes followed the progress of the trio.</p><p>The Chinese woman looked up and a wide and happy smile appeared on her face. She ran over with the obvious intent on hugging the man when the two women stepped in front. of him and while they were smiling there was something cold in their smiles. The Chinese woman gave the two other women an annoyed look but stopped. They started talking and Hayato, along with nearly everyone else in the club, strained their ears to listen in. While muted some of the conversation drifted across the club. Not a lot but enough to rivet the attention of the diners and partiers.</p><p>"Now is that any way for friends to greet each other?" The Chinese woman said with a pout in her voice. "You think, after all this time, you get over that little...misunderstanding." She said. The two women snorted in response but the atmosphere seemed to lighten. "I been good, yes?"</p><p>"You're still a conniving bitch, Shampoo." The woman in blue replied.</p><p>"Take one to know one." Shampoo replied. "Hello Akane." She said in pleasant tones. "Ukyo." She greeted the other exchanged looks with Akane and Ukyo and the two woman reluctantly stepped back. "Ranma." Purred Shampoo. "You finally come see Shampoo."</p><p>Ranma shrugged a shoulder. "This is not purely a social call." He said. "You're still a fucking bitch, Shampoo." Ranma said in even tones. "But you're an honorable bitch, in your own twisted way."</p><p>"Sweet talker." Shampoo replied cutely. "We fuck now?"</p><p>Akane snorted. "Talk about a one track mind." She said. "We're not kids anymore, Shampoo." Akane smiled coldly. "So, if Ranma decides to give you what you want, all it means is that Ranma is giving you the baby you want. Nothing more."</p><p>Shampoo twisted her mouth wryly. "Is not that Ranma decision?" She asked.</p><p>"That is my decision, Shampoo." Ranma said firmly. "Take it or leave it."</p><p>"Oh, I take." Shampoo replied. She smiled sexily. "I no worry, once Ranma have Shampoo, Ranma not want anyone else." She said. "Shampoo make Ranma forget all about Akane and Ukyo."</p><p>"Hah." Ukyo laughed disparagingly. She leaned her face close to Shampoo's. "Let's get one thing straight, sugar." She said. "You don't make Ranma do anything." Her smile became almost cruel and she reached with her hand to cup Shampoo's chin. Her thumb caressed Shampoo's lower lip. "We're going to have such fun breaking you, sugar." She said softly. Ukyo snatched her hand back when Shampoo tried biting her thumb. "No biting, Miss Kitty." She scolded with a laugh.</p><p>"Well maybe a little biting." Akane replied.</p><p>"Enough." Ranma said sharply. "Nab's wants to expand our presence in Kita." He said. "Two of the local families have already agreed to follow the Ice Queen." He looked at Shampoo with some doubt. "Nabs seems to think you should be in charge." Shampoo nodded as if she expected Ranma's announcement. Ranma tilted his head. "There's also going to be a party at Kodachi's club this weekend." He said. "For Pema."</p><p>"Oh, how is little mountain girl?" Shampoo purred. "She still share your bed?"</p><p>"Not that it's any of your business but yes, she does." Ranma replied. "Now if you promise to be nice..."</p><p>"I'll settle for not bitchy." Akane muttered.</p><p>"Not worry, Ranma." Shampoo replied obviously ignoring Akane. "Shampoo no have interest in little mountain girl." She said. "I leave alone for two year, yes?" She added. "Surprised you keep for self so long." She said. "Such waste." She said. "So much money lost."</p><p>Ranma ignored Shampoo's comment. "Like I said, if you promise to be nice, you can come to the party." Ranma looked at Akane and Ukyo. "Let's go guys." He said.</p><p>"Why you rush off, Ranma?" Shampoo pouted. "I not see for months and you already leave?" She shook her head. "I have too, too private room upstairs." She said coaxingly. "Why you not let Shampoo show you?"</p><p>"Beg for it Shampoo." Akane said with a sneer. "I want to hear you beg for it." She pointed down. "Get on your knees and beg for his cock."</p><p>"It usually men who beg me." Shampoo shot back. "I no need beg man."</p><p>"That's where you're wrong sugar." Ukyo replied. "No askee, no dickee." She turned to Ranma. "Isn't that right, Ran-chan?" She said. She leaned against Ranma. "Want me to suck your cock, Ran-chan?" She pitched her voice so Shampoo would hear. "Please, Ran-chan." She begged cutely.</p><p>"I dunno, Uk-chan." Ranma replied. "Should I let Uk-chan suck my cock, Tomboy?"</p><p>"Only if I get to watch." Akane replied in hungry tones. Ranma chuckled and Ukyo looked at Shampoo and deliberately licked her lips. Akane also looked at Shampoo. "Oh yeah, I forgot." Akane said. "You've got to beg me for it too."</p><p>"You want watch too?" Shampoo asked in amusement.</p><p>Akane nodded in anticipation. "You don't know how long I've wanted to see you one your knees in front of Ranma." She said. "Beg for it." She commanded. "I just might say yes."</p><p>Shampoo laughed. "Maybe next time." She said. She gave Akane an grudgingly respectful look. "Who know." She smiled at Akane. "I might...beg, one day." She looked at Ranma. "Does Shampoo at least get good night kiss?" She asked.</p><p>"No free samples, Shampoo." Ranma replied. Ranma gave Shampoo an approving nod. "But keep up the good work and maybe..." Suddenly Ranma smiled and he looked behind Shampoo. "Hello, old ghoul." Ranma laughed and turned. Akane and Ukyo each took an arm and they made their way out of the club. The door closed behind them. Slowly the background noise in the club returned to it's previous levels and some brave soul took to the karaoke.</p><p>Hayato breathed out a breath he hadn't known he was holding. "I think I could use another beer." He muttered.</p><p>"Good thinking, Hayato." Mr. Tomohara said. He mopped his forehead. "One more beer and then I think we should all go home."</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Tomohara." Chorused his employees.</p><p>Cologne hopped out of a corner on her staff. "He's stronger then ever." She rasped. "They all are." She said. "He's agreed to give you a child." She said. "Beg if you must, but you will have Ranma's child."</p><p>"Want Ranma too." Shampoo said with a pout.</p><p>"Take what's given, child." Cologne replied. "You have six months." She said.</p><p>Shampoo frowned slightly and looked down. "Yes, Great Grandmother." She said in resignation.</p><p>"Oh cheer up, child." Cologne with a cackle in her voice. "I'm sure there are worse fates then pillowing Ranma." She said. "Even if it's only for six months."</p><p>Shampoo smiled. "True." She agreed. Her smile dropped. "She still not found?"</p><p>Cologne shook her head. "No." She admitted. "But it's just a matter of time before she shows up here." She said. "After all, where else could she go?"</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo entered the limo that was waiting for them. Akane and Ukyo curled up comfortably against Ranma "Where to guys?" Ranma asked once they were settled . "It's still early."</p><p>"I feel like celebrating." Akane said. "The bitch was mine." She said in a satisfied snarl. Akane barked a laugh. "I liked that line, Uk-chan." She said. "We're going to have so much fun breaking you." She said in a fair imitation of Ukyo's voice. She extended an arm across Ranma and bumped fists with Ukyo. Akane sat up. "I know." She said. "Let's go to the club." She said. "Let's see what Kodachi has in mind for..." She grinned. "Daddy's Girls."</p><p>"Hey, good idea, Tomboy." Ranma said in agreement. He leaned forward and pressed a button next to a grill in the side of the limo. "Ky's Club, please." He said. Ranma leaned back against the back seat of the limo and Akane and Ukyo both resumed their curled up positions next to Ranma. "I think you scared her, guys." Ranma said after they had drove along for awhile.</p><p>Akane snorted. "I know I scared her." She said emphatically. Akane looked up at Ranma and found him looking down at her. "Cologne's back." She elbowed Ranma when an anticipatory smile appeared on his face. "Hey dummy, you know it's going to be tough, whatever it is."</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Yeah." He said. "Aint it great?" He said enthusiastically. Ranma shrugged his powerful shoulders. "Whatever it is, we either deal with it or we don't." He said. "Might as well have some fun along the way."</p><p>"Ooh, now he's a philosopher." Ukyo snuggled against Ranma's side.</p><p>"And it was getting boring." Ranma added.</p><p>"Now, that's the Ranma I know." Akane said contentedly. She changed her position against Ranma's side so that she was able to look out the window. One arm was raised so that the back of her hand was against Ranma's chest. Ranma's hand rested comfortably on her stomach. 'We're not kids anymore.' She thought replaying her conversation with Shampoo in her head. 'No we're not.' She watched the buildings go by through the window. "It's funny." She said aloud. "When I'd daydream about the future..." She chuckled slightly. "It certainly wasn't this one." She said. Akane felt Ranma's hand squeeze comfortingly against her stomach. "What's funny is that I think if any of those day dreams had come true..." She chuckled again. "I think I'd be bored out of my mind."</p><p>Ukyo nodded against Ranma's shoulder. "Ting Li said something similar once." She said. "She said she expected to be training every day and living like a monk, or something like that." She said. "I kind of expected to have at least a couple kids right now."</p><p>"Yeah, me too." Akane said in quiet agreement.</p><p>"Don't laugh, but so did I." Ranma said. "I fell asleep on the couch the other day and had this weird dream." Ranma said. "You, me and Uk-chan were...married, I guess." He said. "And we had a bunch of kids together."</p><p>"Boys or girls?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Both." Ranma replied. "They all had my curse." Ranma laughed. "And I even had a kid of my own." He said. "Courtesy of the Tomboy."</p><p>"Figures." Ukyo said in amused tones. Ukyo turned slightly and placed a hand on Ranma's shoulder. "So, even in your dreams the three of us are together." She said musingly.</p><p>"Even in my dreams, Uk-chan." Ranma agreed.</p><p>"I guess that means I should stick around a little longer, huh?" Ukyo said.</p><p>"You hear me or Ranma telling you to leave, Uk-chan?" Akane said.</p><p>"Just checking." Ukyo replied. "Do you really plan on giving the Joketsuzoku the baby they want?" She asked a few moments later.</p><p>"Yeah." Ranma said reluctantly."At least I know they'll take care of the kid." He said.</p><p>"Do I get one too?" Ukyo asked. She laughed. "All this talk about children." She sighed. "So, do I?"</p><p>"Believe me, Uk-chan." Akane said. "I'd much rather Ranma gave you a baby that Shampoo." She said. "And if you want a baby and Ranma agrees..." She smiled. "All you have to do is ask."</p><p>"I'll hold you guys to that." Ukyo said teasingly.</p><p>The limo finally pulled up in front of the club. The driver, an employee of the Ice Queen's, opened the passenger side door. Limo's were not an unusual occurrance at Ky's club and neither were beautiful people. The ever present papperazi boredly raised their cameras. The driver walked over to the passenger door and opened it. A pair of shapely legs extended from the car as flashes from the cameras lit up the night. The flashes became a constant strobe once the blue gowned woman's identify became known. When Ranma and then Ukyo exited the limo, it spawned a frenzy usually associated with the sharp toothed denizens of the world's oceans. Several of the papparazi pulled out cellphones and started shouting.</p><p>"They're here." One papparazi shouted. "What do you mean, who am I talking about?" The man shouted. "Them." He said. "The Terrible Three." He said. "Yes." The man put down the phone and raised his camera to take several more pictures of the posing trio.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo walked into the the outer club where their presence caused nearly as big a stir as outside. Even before they reached the door to the inner club, Abe had climbed to his feet and was bowing respectfully. The big man found himself on the receiving end of a triple hug and kiss.</p><p>"I really wish you'd do that when you're a girl, Ranma." Abe complained good naturedly. "I got a rep to maintain, you know." He said. Ranma laughed. After a moment so did Abe. "Good to see you guys." He said as he opened the door to the inner club. "You really should visit more often."</p><p>"We get here when we can, Abe." Akane said. She patted the big man on the cheek. "When we can." She repeated.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo entered the club. Before they even took a dozen steps a woman in a expensive and heavily embroidered kimono in red, peach and white and made up in the stylized makeup of a very senior Geisha hurried over. "Ranma." Nodoka exclaimed happily.</p><p>Wiith a laugh Ranma swept his mother up in a hug and swung her around. Nodoka giggled like a schoolgirl. Ranma placed his mother back on her feet. "Hey Mom." He said. "Have I told you, you look great?" He said. His smile became slightly sour when two young men walked over and took obviously protective positions behind Nodoka. "Jiro, Daisuke." Ranma said in greeting. "Still here, huh?"</p><p>Nodoka swatted Ranma with her fan. "Be nice to my boys, Ranma." Nodoka scolded. "They're good boys." She said.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, I know." Ranma replied. He gave the two young men a apologetic bow. "My apologies."</p><p>"Gratefully accepted, Mr. Saotome." Daisuke replied. The two young men bowed respectfully in return.</p><p>"That's better." Nodoka said cheerfully. She turned to Akane and Ukyo. "Well?" She said imperiously. Akane and Ukyo laughed and gave Nodoka a kiss on the cheek and a brief hug. Nodoka gave the two young women a penetrating look before breaking out into a wide smile. "Obviously my son is treating you two well." She said in approval. She linked her arms through Akane and Ukyo's arms and led them through the club. "I've already had a number of very promising inquiries over Pema and Kagomi." She said as they walked.</p><p>"I thought you didn't take bids until the..unveiling." Ukyo asked in surprise.</p><p>"Oh, my dear, when it comes to my girls, very little is left to chance." Nodoka said firmly. "Fumie does a very good job of vetting our clients." She said. "For example, when we introduced Sumire there were three bids from women." Nodoka smiled. "Women hardly ever bid on a girl." Nodoka continued.</p><p>"You told them to bid?'" Ukyo guessed.</p><p>"I suggested they might find Sumire...sympathetic." Nodoka replied. "I think any one of them would have been acceptable to Sumire but I do confess to some satisfaction that she chose Mitch." She squeezed Akane and Ukyo's arms. "I do hope you'll be able to stay long enough to say hello."</p><p>Akane and Ukyo turned their heads and looked at Ranma. "Ranma?" Akane asked.</p><p>"I want to meet them too." Ranma said with a smile. "Besides, the food here is pretty good."</p><p>"Oh, wonderful." Gushed Nodoka. They reached Nodoka's private booth and sat down. Nodoka took the seat next to Ranma much to the amused annoyance of Akane, Ukyo, Daisuke and Jiro. "Now, let me take a good look at you." Nodoka said. Her smile twisted slightly. "I was going to say, I wish you wouldn't use so much makeup." Nodoka began. "Except that it looks good on you."</p><p>"Thanks Mom." Ranma replied.</p><p>"Now, as I was saying." Nodoka continued. "We've already had a number of inquiries regarding Jewel and Gem." She said. "In fact, I was looking over several of the more serious ones just before you arrived." She indicated a small pile of folders. "Most of them..." Nodoka shook her head. "But..." She indicated several folders that were in a separate pile. "Take this one for example." She opened the folder. "The Sagahara twins." She turned the folder so Ranma, Akane and Ukyo could see the contents. "Wealthy...old money...well educated and...unfortunately... extraordinarily close in a way that twins sometimes are."</p><p>"I have a pair of cousins like that." Ukyo said idly.</p><p>Nodoka opened another folder. "Now these two young men are not twins though they are cousins." Nodoka said. "Their parents are...concerned."</p><p>"Meaning they're gay." Akane guessed. She shook her head. "Cross them off the list." She said firmly. "Pema and Kagomi need real relationships, not pretense."</p><p>Nodoka nodded and moved the folder into the larger pile. She took the remaining two folders. "And finally...these two." She said. "Also cousins." She laughed. "And definitely not gay...exactly."</p><p>"What does...not gay...exactly, mean?" Ranma asked in amused tones.</p><p>"Well..." Nodoka paused. "They've been with both Aoi and Miki and they...tend, yes tend to, um, share." She explained. "Aoi feels that they're, shall we say, curious." She said. "On the other hand, both Aoi and Miki report that their pillow skills are more than adequate and very enthusiastic." She tapped the two folders. "I also spoke to their mothers." She said with a smile. "They seemed quite excited by the prospect."</p><p>"No doubt." Drawled Akane. "Ranma has the final say, of course, but the twins and those two are probably the best choices."</p><p>"Ranma?" Nodoka asked. Ranma nodded. "Excellent." Nodoka exclaimed. "Now it's just a matter of making sure the bids are...appropriate." Nodoka raised a hand and within moments Fumie was approaching the table. The pretty blond exchanged greetings with Ranma, Akane and Ukyo before giving Nodoka an expectant look. Nodoka handed Fumie the three folders. "Fumie be a dear and make the necessary arrangements." She said. "Oh and have the kitchen make us something to eat." Fumie nodded.</p><p>"One thing, Fumie." Ranma said suddenly. "I want you to make it clear to these young men who the girls are and who I am." He said. "If they hurt my girls..." He said threateningly.</p><p>"Don't worry, Ranma." Fumie said reassuringly. "Auntie wouldn't choose anyone like that but...I can't see the harm of...reminding them." She said. "How's that?" She asked. Ranma nodded. Fumie looked at the folders, smiled and walked away.</p><p>End Chapter 3</p><p>Author's Note: And the beat goes on.</p>
