</div><p>Chapter 8</p><p>'Confrontation'</p><p>Nodoka opened the door of the Tendo residence. "Nabiki. Kimi." She said with relief in her voice. "Come in." The two women entered and Nodoka closed and locked the door behind her. "Everyone's here." She said as she escorted the women into the house. "Your father and Genma are on the roof keeping guard."</p><p>"And who's watching them to make sure they stay awake?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Konatsu." Nodoka replied with a slight smile.</p><p>"Good." Nabiki replied . She and Kimi entered the main room. Ono and Kasumi were sitting at the large low table. "Hey sis." Nabiki called. "Doc." Kimi echoed Nabiki's greetings.</p><p>Kasumi jumped up, hurried over and embraced Nabiki and then Kimi. "I was just about to send Ono to get you." Kasumi scolded mildly.</p><p>"Sorry Kasumi." Nabiki sat down at the table. It being a cool night a blanket was draped over the table. She eased her legs under the blanket. "Gods I forgot how good that feels." She said as her legs were warmed by the heater under the table. "This used to be my favorite spot." She told Kimi who had sat down next to her. "I used to do my homework here on cold days." She sighed nostalgically.</p><p>Kimi smiled in appreciation and accepted a cup of tea from Kasumi. "Must have been nice." She agreed. She looked at her watch. "Any moment now."</p><p>Nabiki nodded and pulled out her cell phone. She punched in a number. "Chikato?" She said when the telephone was answered. "Tendo here. There's going to be some noise down at the warehouse district." She smiled cooly into the mouthpiece. "Give them at least a half-hour after the first reports, okay?" Nabiki nodded and hung up.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"You know the plan." Ranma said quietly. "Tatewaki." He nodded at the tall swordsman. "Your team takes out the rank and file." He said. "Try to get as many as you can before the alarm gets raised." Ranma added. "And remember, they have guns."<p>"Noted." Tatewaki replied shortly.</p><p>He looked at the orange haired woman standing off to one side. "Ting Li." He said. "Are you sure Cologne will stand down once you give her the council's summons?"</p><p>"She either stop or she become outlaw." Ting Li replied firmly. "Honored Elder Cologne not refuse Council summons."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "You stay behind the Tomboy and Uk-chan." He ordered. "Their job is to get you to Cologne." He said. "I'll take care of Hikaru and Shampoo." He looked around. "Well, what are you all standing around for? Let's go."</p><p>Tatewaki hurried back to his team of Ninja retainers. He drew his sword. "Destiny awaits." He said. "They say Destiny is a woman and it is never good to keep a woman waiting. I speak from experience." There were chuckles from the assembled dark clad Ninja. "Follow me." Tatewaki leaped into the darkness and toward the warehouse. His Ninja followed silently. They seemed to melt into the darkness around the warehouse.</p><p>Ranma turned to Akane, Ukyo and Ting Li. "Let's go." He said. He sprinted off, followed by the three young women, into the evening darkness.</p><p>Hikaru looked up at the sound of alarms. "What?" Hikaru snarled. The door to his office opened suddenly and one of the Chinese mercenaries he had working for him hurried in. "This better be good." Hikaru growled.</p><p>"Someone has broken into the warehouse Oyabun." The man replied. "They've already succeeded in breaching our first line of defense."</p><p>"Crap." Hikaru jumped out of his seat and raced out of his third floor office. As he ran toward the stairs Shampoo intercepted him. "Out of my way bitch." He growled. "We got problems."</p><p>"Me know Airen." Shampoo replied cooly. "Great grandmother say it Ranma and his allies." She said as the two hurried toward the stairs.</p><p>"Ranma huh?" A cold and anticipatory smile came to the Yakusa lord's face. "I've been dying for a chance to get back at that faggot."</p><p>"Dying is what you do if you not pay attention." Shampoo shot back.</p><p>Hikaru snorted in derision. "Yeah right." He said. "If anyone is going to die it's pretty boy." Hikaru stopped. "But I'm not going to take any chances." Hikaru took a breath, held it, then released it slowly. As the breath left his lungs Hikaru's features smoothed. "Let's go." He said in a near monotone.</p><p>'Aiyah.' Shampoo thought in surprise. 'He's done it and he didn't need to accept his female side.' She felt her confidence rise. 'We have a chance.' Shampoo smiled. "Tell you what, you take Ranma, I take kitchen destroyer."</p><p>"What about that other one? What was her name? Oh yes, Ukyo." Hikaru asked in the same near monotone.</p><p>Shampoo made a noise that was halfway between a snort and a chuckle. "She nothing. You fight her, you know." Hikaru nodded absently. "But it good idea I take care of her first." Shampoo nodded to herself as the raced down the stairs. The sounds of battle reached their ears and they followed the noise to a scene of total mayhem. A dozen dark clad fighters were facing off against Hikaru's Chinese mercenaries. Leading them was Tatewaki. "Where Ranma?" Shampoo asked herself. She looked around. The Chinese mercenaries though they outnumbered Tatewaki's Ninja were being pushed back relentlessly.</p><p>Hikaru charged into the fray and the surprised Ninja began to fall back. Tatewaki spun around when he espied Hikaru he smiled. "Ho varlet." He called almost cheerfully. "Shall we take up were we left off?" He charged.</p><p>Hikaru smiled slightly as he retreated. Tatewaki chased after Hikaru not realizing their path was beginning to form an inward spiral.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma looked up sharply as they raced toward the warehouse. "Crap." He exclaimed.<p>"Ran-chan?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"Don't you feel it Ukyo?" Akane interrupted. "Someone is putting out a lot of cold chi." She looked at Ranma. "Hikaru?" She said.</p><p>"Has to be." Ranma agreed. "Shampoo's not that powerful. Or she wasn't last time we saw her." He picked up the pace. "And someone is putting out a lot of hot battle chi and it's probably Tatewaki." Ranma's face smoothed out. 'If we don't get there it'll be one hell of a Hiryo Shoten Ha." His voice too reflected a lack of emotion.</p><p>Akane looked at Ranma. 'He's out of it.' She realized.</p><p>"Tomboy find Cologne. I'm going to help Tatewaki." Ranma ordered in the same near monotone. Without waiting for a response Ranma raced away.</p><p>"You heard the man." Akane said a moment later. "Ting Li stay between us. If I know Cologne she probably already knows you're here and why. She may have to accept the summons when you give it to her but that doesn't mean she has to make it easy to get to her."</p><p>Ting Li nodded. "That true." She admitted. "Surprised you know that." She added.</p><p>"We've been dealing with the Old Ghoul for awhile sugar." Ukyo said.</p><p>Ranma entered the warehouse. He quickly located Tatewaki and Hikaru.. 'Lot's of cold chi coming from Hikaru.' He realized. 'And the spiral is almost complete.' Ranma put on a burst of speed. "Kuno." He yelled. "Stop." To Ranma's surprise and relief the Kendoist stopped. Tatewaki and Hikaru both turned to meet Ranma. "He's mine." He informed Tatewaki.</p><p>"Nay." Tatewaki replied firmly. "He has given insult to my loves." He said. "For that he is mine."</p><p>'Loves?' Thought Ranma. 'Interesting.' He waved a hand. "Sorry Kuno but he hurt Ukyo, I think that trumps an insult." Ranma turned his head. "Where do you think you're going Nakamura?" He smiled. It was more reflex than actual amusement. "Give us a minute and we'll figure out who goes first." Ranma's smile widened slightly as he felt Hikaru's chi change slightly. 'Just get him angry.'</p><p>"Ukyo can defend herself." Countered Tatewaki. "Nabiki and Kimi are helpless by comparison. His threat to kill them has credence."</p><p>"Excuse me." Hikaru said impatiently.</p><p>"Shut up." Chorused Ranma and Tatewaki. "Well I have to give you that." Ranma continued. He felt Hikaru's control falter. "Okay." Ranma said. "He's all yours." He waved a hand. "You don't mind if I watch do you?"</p><p>"Not at all." Tatewaki replied. "Maybe you'll learn something."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane and Ukyo flanked Ting Li as they raced into the warehouse. From what Akane could see Tatewaki's Ninja were holding their own against the Chinese. Ranma was, Akane frowned, 'Why is Ranma just standing there?' She shook her head. 'Nevermind.' She looked behind her. "Everyone's occupied, let's go find Cologne." She ran deeper into the warehouse.<p>Ranma turned his head and watched them go. 'Go get'em Tomboy. uk-chan's got your back.' He thought and turned back to watch the fight between Hikaru and Tatewaki.</p><p>The trios progress was barely impeded by the occasional mercenary attack. "Here comes another one." Akane warned.</p><p>"I got him." Ukyo started twirling her battle spatula until it was a shimmering shield in front of her. She ran directly toward the newest attacker. The spinning spatula deflected the hail of bullets that met her charge. Ukyo smiled from behind the shield of her spatula. 'Damn I'm good.'</p><p>"Stop showing off, Ukyo." Akane called impatiently. "We got a summons to deliver."</p><p>"Go on ahead sugar." Ukyo called back. "I'll catch up."</p><p>"I'll wait." Akane stopped running. "I'm going nowhere without my backup. Now stop fooling around and finish him off."</p><p>"Okay. Okay. Sheesh what a nag. " Ukyo complained with a smile on her face. Ukyo leaped into the air to the mercenary's surprise. She landed behind the man, spun around and lashed out with one leg. The blow connected and the man went, literally, flying. Ukyo gave Akane a short bow. "Satisfied?"</p><p>"Yeah, now get back here." Akane snapped. When Ukyo trotted over Akane pulled her into a brief hug.</p><p>"Miss me?" Ukyo teased.</p><p>Akane grinned. "Yeah, yeah. Now let's go." She and Ukyo flanked Ting Li and the three women continued their search through the warehouse. "Now if I were the old ghoul where would I be?"</p><p>"A cave?" Ting Li hazarded. "Some place easy to defend." She added.</p><p>Akane looked at Ukyo. "Basement?"</p><p>"Basement." Ukyo agreed. She pointed . "That door looks promising." So saying, Ukyo took the lead and made for the door, though she waited until Akane had position next to the door before she opened it. Ukyo ducked through, looked around, then waved Akane and Ting Li through. The door led to stairs to a lower level. "Bingo." She ran down the stairs with Akane and Ting Li on her heels. They quickly reached the lower floor.</p><p>The stairs opened into a well furnished reception area with couches, chairs and tables making a number of conversation areas. Someone was seated on the couch facing them. The figure rose. "Which one want be first?"</p><p>"Hello Shampoo." Akane said in an almost pleasant tone. "Looking as slutty as ever, I see." She smiled. "And I don't mean the clothes. You might want to tone down the eye shadow, you look like a cheap hooker."</p><p>"You would know." Shampoo purred back.</p><p>"You gonna stop us?" Akane asked. She nodded toward the nervous looking Ting Li. "Cologne has a letter from home."</p><p>"You must stand aside." Ting Li said firmly. "The Council commands."</p><p>"The Council is not here." Shampoo said back calmly. She eased into an offensive stance. "You want see Great Grandmother? You go passed me." Shampoo took a breath and let it out slowly. She let all her emotions; her anger, her, and she had to admit it to herself, jealousy She let the cool calm of the Soul of Ice take over.</p><p>Akane narrowed her eyes. "Damn she's starting to put out cold chi.' It put Akane at an immediate disadvantage. Shampoo could control the fight and make Akane chase her and that was something Akane had to be wary of. Akane knew the only way to take the advantage away was to reduce the amount of hot chi she was putting out. Akane hesitated as she realized what that meant. 'Don't be a wuss.' She chastised herself. "I always knew you were a cold bitch." Akane said finally. "Now I have proof." She exhaled audibly in the quiet room. Her face smoothed out. "Let's dance."</p><p>Shampoo fought to keep her surprise from breaking her control of the Soul of Ice. She exhaled and regained control. Shampoo nodded toward Akane and then attacked.</p><p>Ukyo and Ting Li watched in awe from the sidelines. Akane and Shampoo were fighting faster than she'd seen anyone other than Ranma fight before. Each punch, Each kick, each block executed with such precision as to make it seem choreographed. Both combatants had matching serene smiles on their faces as they fought. The same smile Ranma wore when he fought.</p><p>"What technique that?" Ting Li breathed in awe.</p><p>"Soul of Ice." Ukyo retorted without taking her eyes off the fight. "Or at least it used to be. " Ukyo added after a moment.</p><p>"I see Soul of Ice before." Ting Li said. "But it not look like that." Ting Li was afraid to blink as Akane and Shampoo exchanged a rapid set of kicks. The sound as the two women's legs met was a gunshot sharp stacatto.</p><p>Ukyo nodded. "Ranma figured out a way of making it more powerful." She explained. "It seems the old ghoul figured it out too." Ukyo watched Akane closely. 'I hope it's easier for her to return this time but if not Ranma and I will be there.' She thought.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru easily fended off the swordsman's attack. He tried to bring his mind to that calm state but he could see Ranma circling just out of the corner of his eyes. 'Bastard is trying to keep me off balance.' Hikaru knew but knowing did not help as much as it might have. He ducked a sword blow and kicked.<p>"Pay attention knave." Tatewaki sounded amused. "I am your opponent not Ranma." He spared the sex changing martial artist a glance. "Is that not right?'</p><p>"Of course Kuno." Ranma said easily.</p><p>"Fuck the both of you." Snarled Hikaru.</p><p>"Sorry, you're not my type." Ranma smiled. "How about you Tatewaki?"</p><p>"Surely you jest." Tatewaki deflected Hikaru's next punch with the flat of his blade. "You may have such leanings but I don't."</p><p>"I dunno Tatewaki." Ranma replied. "Watch the right." He said when Hikaru swung at Tatewaki. "You can't deny having the hots for the pigtailed girl and you knew she was me."</p><p>"Eventually." Tatewaki ducked the next couple of blows from Hikaru. "That was wrong of you not to tell me. Besides at least I am attracted to the female you." Tatewaki surged forward and forced Hikaru to retreat. "Ho varlet." Tatewaki called to the frustrated Yakusa. "Where is this vaunted skill you so boasted of?"</p><p>"Fuck you Tatewaki." Hikaru snapped back. "You know Saotome can step in any time." He glared at Ranma. Hikaru took a breath and firmed his stance.</p><p>"Yes," Tatewaki replied. "But he won't." The edges of Tatewaki's mouth turned up slightly. "Boor though Ranma may be, he still retains some honor."</p><p>"Thanks Kuno." Ranma said wryly. He waved a hand. "Go ahead Hikaru, I won't interfere." He smiled. "I'll fight you after you beat Kuno. If you beat him."</p><p>"Fuck you, Saotome." Hikaru growled. 'Shit!' He thought to himself. 'I got to get out of here.' Hikaru stamped the floor. "Bakusai Tenkatsu." The floor erupted under the feet of Ranma and Tatewaki. When they regained their balance Hikaru Nakamura was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"Coward." Tatewaki sneered.</p><p>"Not really Kuno." Ranma said seriously. "This is not his only bolt hole." He said. "He's stopped for now." Ranma looked pensive. "I didn't know he knew that." He said musingly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane and Shampoo were both now putting out enough cold chi to cause frost to start forming on every exposed surface. Ukyo rubbed her arms. "Damn." She exclaimed to the accompaniment of a plume of vapor. Ukyo looked around. The battle between Akane and Shampoo left the reception area looking like a tornado had blown through it. Couches and chairs were, those that remained intact, upended. Broken glass was everywhere and still the two women battled. Despite the cold and worry, Ukyo couldn't help but feel proud of Akane. "That's my girl." She called. "Show the bitch who's boss."<p>Akane, though deep in the Soul of Ice, couldn't help but revel in her ability. With the distractions of her negative emotions gone, Akane was totally concentrated on the fight. 'No wonder Ranma smiles during a fight.' She thought to herself. Akane looked at Shampoo. 'Got to get under her skin.' Akane told herself. 'Now what would Ranma do?' Suddenly Akane's smile widened. She ducked a punch, evaded a kick and reached out and squeezed one of Shampoo's breasts. "Ooh nice tits." Akane said with a smile.</p><p>"Always knew you were pervert." Shampoo shot back.</p><p>Akane's smile widened even more. "Yep." She said cheerfully. "That's why Ranma sleeps in my bed and not yours."</p><p>"If Ranma sleep in my bed he not need two women." Shampoo snapped back stung.</p><p>"Hey Uk-chan is a lot of fun in bed." Akane replied. "Besides Ranma can satisfy two women." She said in satisfied tones. "He's a lot of man, you know." She said. "Oh that's right, you don't know." Akane suppressed a smile at the slight frown that appeared on Shampoo's face. "I wonder why that is?" She said in a musing tone. "Maybe you're just not Ranma's type." Akane started circling Shampoo. "Now me, I like big tits on a girl." She sighed dramatically. "Ranma loves when I play with her tits. Isn't that right Uk-chan?" She called.</p><p>"That's right sugar." Ukyo called back. "Especially when you're a boy." Ukyo smiled. 'That's the way sugar, get her mad. Let's see if I can help.' She thought. "Maybe Ranma heard Shampoo doesn't like oral."</p><p>"Is that it Shampoo? A little short on the tongue?" Akane asked. "Ranma really likes it when I go down on him." She grinned. "Or her." Akane smacked her lips. "You should see how he squirms." She forced a laugh. "Does Hikaru squirm? No? You must be doing something wrong."</p><p>Shampoo felt her control falter. 'No!' She told herself. 'I will not let her get to me.'</p><p>"Tell you what Shampoo." Akane continued circling the Amazon. "If you win I'll do to you what I do to Ranma." Her circle turned into a spiral. "If you want, I'll even turn into a boy for you."</p><p>"Oh you know a girl knows what a girl wants." Ukyo called cheerfully. 'Good girl.' She thought. "You really should try girls Shampoo, I'll bet you'd like it." She grinned. "Akane is really good at it."</p><p>"Why thank you Uk-chan." Akane gave Shampoo a knowing look. "You know, Hikaru was putting out some cold chi before. Maybe Shampoo is not as straight as we thought. Maybe she tried a little sushi and found she liked it."</p><p>"I. Not. Like. Girls." Growled Shampoo as the last vestiges of her control left her.</p><p>"Too bad." Akane purred. She smiled. "Hiryo Shoten Ha!" Her arm came out spinning and suddenly a small tornado erupted in the reception room. Shampoo wailed in despair as the winds pulled her into the funnel. Akane stepped back and watched in something like satisfaction as her long-time rival was tossed like a rag doll across the room. Shampoo hit the far wall and fell to the floor unconscious. With the absence of Shampoo's hot chi the small tornado quickly dissipated.</p><p>Ukyo hurried over to Akane. "Nice one sugar." She said. She wrapped an arm around Akane's waist. "Not even Ranma could do better." She felt Akane shudder and she tightened her hold on the dark haired girl. "I got you sugar." She said soothingly as Akane wailed like a lost soul as her more negative emotions returned. "I got you."</p><p>Akane nodded. She licked dry lips. "I'm okay." She said. "It wasn't so bad this time." Ukyo could feel another shudder wrack Akane's body giving the lie to her words. She took a breath and let it out slowly. Finally she nodded. "I'm okay." She repeated. She gave Ukyo a weak grin. "Just don't let go, okay?"</p><p>"Never sugar." Ukyo said seriously.</p><p>Ting Li ran over. "That, that was incredible. I never see technique done like that." She gave Akane a deep bow of respect, then looked at the unconscious Shampoo. "Amazing." She murmured. "We go find Elder Cologne now, yes?"</p><p>"No need." Colognes ancient and dry voice filled the room. She approached the trio her hands clapping together slowly. "Very well done." She said to Akane. "I had despaired of you ever learning enough control to master it." She looked at Ting Li. "Hello child."</p><p>Ting Li bowed. "Elder." She said respectfully. She reached into her tunic and extracted an intricately folded document. She extended it two handed to Cologne. "The Council wishes your presence."</p><p>Cologne sighed and took the summons. "I see." She said regretfully. Then she shrugged. "Well it was a good try." She said. "I suspect the Council will disband my operation." She looked at Akane. "You've won." She informed Akane. "This time."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma wandered through the warehouse. 'Tatewaki did pretty good.' He admitted to himself grudgingly. He idly looked in the occasional crate and climbed along some of the high storage areas Most of the crates contained nothing more sinister than canned goods but a few. Ranma smiled in satisfaction. 'At least those drugs won't get on the street.' He wasn't too pleased about Cologne and Shampoo just walking away but, Ranma shrugged, there was always another time. 'At least Nakamura won't be causing any more trouble for awhile.'<p>Ranma came to a door. "Hmm wonder what's behind this one?" He opened the door. A cadaverous looking man was hunched over a table. Ranma shook his head. "Hello Gos."</p><p>Hikaru Gosenkugi looked up. "Hello Ranma." Gos said a voice that matched his appearance. "And good-bye." To Ranma's surprise Gosenkugi vanished right before his eyes. "We'll meet again." There was a hollow laugh and then some paper appeared in the air.</p><p>"Umisenken?" Ranma said in disbelief. "Great, just great." Ranma looked around and spotted the paper that had dropped from the air. Ranma bent over and picked up one of them. It was a photograph. Ranma looked at it. "Not a bad shot of Akane." Ranma smiled. "Maybe I'll get it framed."</p><p>Captain Osigi hurried over to Tatewaki Kuno. "Milord, the Police will be here soon." The Captain looked around in satisfaction. "We must go."</p><p>"Our casualities?" Tatewaki stood with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>"Attended to milord." Captain Osigi said reassuringly. "We must go now." He repeated forcefully.</p><p>Tatewaki sighed and nodded. "I suppose we are done here." Tatewaki turned and strode out of the warehouse. Tatewaki observed the activity that bustled around him. His Ninja, for the first time Tatewaki actually considered then 'his' Ninja, had completed securing those Chinese mercenaries that had not escaped into the night. A dark colored car waited. Tatewaki entered the back of the vehicle. He rolled down the window. "I think it would be best if you escorted Cologne and Shampoo back to China."</p><p>"It will be done Milord." Captain Osigi replied. "Please convey my best wishes to the Ladies Tendo and Ota."</p><p>Tatewaki smiled slightly. "That is the first time you referred to her as the Lady Ota." Tatewaki said to the Captain."Thank you Captain." The window rose and the car drove away.</p><p>Captain Osigi watched the car drive off. "You are very welcome Milord." He said to the retreating car.</p><p>Tatewaki's driver took Tatewaki to the Tendo home. The car stopped in front of the gate of the Tendo compound and Tatewaki exited he car. He walked through the gate and into the compound proper. The front door of the house opened and Kimi ran out, Nabiki followed at a more sedate pace then gave up all pretence and joined Kimi in running to Tatewaki. They both embraced him. "My Ladies." Tatewaki said in satisfaction. "We are victorious."</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Akane sat on the roof of the apartment building and stared into the clear night sky. Ranma and Ukyo flanked her silently. They had found her sitting up here a short time after they returned home. They waited in companionable silence ever since. "Now what?" She said finally. "Cologne is gone, Hikaru defanged; and yet nothing's changed." She leaned back, supporting herself with her arms. "Nothing."</p><p>"Oh I don't know Tomboy." Ranma wrapped an arm around Akane's waist. "You beat Shampoo, that's something." He squeezed her waist. "You did real good Tomboy."</p><p>"Ranma's right sugar." Ukyo butted Akane with her shoulder playfully. "You should be proud of yourself."</p><p>Akane smiled briefly. "Yeah, I should but,"</p><p>"No buts sugar." Ukyo interrupted. "And if you can't be proud of what you did then I'll be proud for you." She smiled. "Damn sugar, I'm damn near to bursting that's how proud I am." She slapped a hand over Akane's mouth to prevent a protest. "It's time to forgive yourself, sugar." She nodded at Ranma. "We have." Her smile faded slightly. "Maybe it's time for me to leave."</p><p>Akane pushed Ukyo's hand away. "No." She said quickly. "Not yet, please Ukyo, not yet." She pleaded. "I-I'm not, I can't." She turned around. "Please Ranma, tell her to stay."</p><p>Ranma was silent for a moment then looked across Akane to Ukyo. "Be a shame to break up the act." He said with a slight smile.</p><p>"There is that." Ukyo agreed slowly.</p><p>"That's right." Akane said eagerly. "You don't really want to go back to being a cook." Akane added. "You'd be bored out of your mind in a week and you know it." She grabbed Ukyo's hand. "Come on Uk-chan." She said in her best Aoi baby voice. "We'll give you a Red and Blue special." She cooed while looking pleadingly at Ukyo.</p><p>"Guy version." Ukyo shot back.</p><p>"Deal." Akane said in relief. "Thanks Ukyo."</p><p>"I can't believe you'd give up having Ranma to yourself." She looked passed Akane. "Wipe that smug look off your face Ran-chan." She said. "I'm only staying because Akane asked so nicely."</p><p>"I know Uk-chan." A smiling Ranma agreed. "Thanks."</p><p>Ukyo stood. "Who's hungry?"</p><p>"Me!" Chorused Ranma and Akane.</p><p>"You guys are so weird." Ukyo chuckled. "Thank all the gods in heaven for that."</p><p>"Amen." Chorused Ranma and Akane. "Amen."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I'm not here." Lieutenant Noriudo said as Nabiki opened the door. He walked into the apartment. "Where's Tatewaki and Kimi?"<p>"Out on the balcony." Nabiki replied. "I'll get them." Nabiki walked slowly away. She returned with Tatewaki and Kimi a little while later.</p><p>"Hey Chikato." Kimi called cheerfully. "Why the long face? The Chinese are gone and we got Hikaru on the run what more do you want? You should be celebrating."</p><p>"Yeah." The policeman agreed. "But now it's going to be boring around here." He grumbled. He joined the laughter that erupted around him. "Upstairs is pleased." He sat down and accepted a drink from Nabiki. "Sure why not?" He said. "I've earned it."</p><p>"That you have Chikato." Nabiki agreed. "Don't worry about getting bored Chikato, something will turn up." She smiled. "It always does."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Oh stop pouting." Snapped Cologne. "It's unbecoming a warrior of your stature." Despite the swaying of the captured pirate ship, Cologne was able to hop on her staff over to Shampoo. "There is no shame in losing to Akane Tendo."<p>"No shame?" Shampoo growled in angry disbelief.</p><p>"No shame." Cologne said firmly. "And it will state so in my report to the Council." Cologne balanced easily on her staff. "You constantly underestimate her Grand daughter. If you had taken the time to study your opponent properly you would have realized her potential." Still balancing on her staff Cologne pulled out her pipe and puffed it alight. "It's obvious Ranma has finally realized the girl's potential."</p><p>"Still shouldn't have lost to her." Shampoo grumped.</p><p>"Patience, you will have a chance at her again." Cologne counseled confidently.</p><p>"You know the Council is going to demand we disband our operations." Shampoo pointed out. She shot a glance toward the command deck of the ship where she could see an orange haired figure watching her. "Bitch." She snarled. "Ow." She complained a moment later when Cologne hit her on top of her head with her cane.</p><p>"Stop it." Cologne snapped. She turned her gaze toward the command deck. "The young woman deserves your respect." Cologne puffed on her pipe for a moment. A slow smile came to her face. "And she may be useful." Cologne puffed on her pipe again. "Let me handle the Council, you just worry about your training."</p><p>Ting Li watched moodily from the deck. She found she already missed Japan. 'Be honest Ting Li, you miss them.' She thought to herself. 'Aiyah, now those are warriors.' Lost in thought she didn't hear her name called until it was repeated. "Oh so sorry Captain, I daydreaming." She said to the older man standing next to her.</p><p>"It's alright." Captain Osigi said calmly. "We'll go ashore after dark and try to avoid any Chinese patrol ships." He informed the orange haired Joketsuzoku. "After that it's your problem."</p><p>"I understand." Ting Li replied. "Um Captain?" Ting Li said hesitantly. "Do you think you maybe stay close by for two day?" She asked. "Just outside China waters." She suggested. "Wait for radio message."</p><p>Captain Osigi raised an eyebrow. "We are not running a taxi service Ting Li." He said stiffly.</p><p>"Please Captain." Ting Li begged. "Just need day to get Cologne to Joketsuzoku agent." She looked at Captain Osigi. "I offer my service as vassal to Ice Queen, want make good on vow."</p><p>Captain Osigi gave Ting Li a hard stare. He tried to suppress a smile of grudging approval when the young woman returned his stare unflinchingly. Then he nodded once. "Two days." He said.</p><p>"Thank you Captain." Ting Li replied gratefully.</p><p>End Book 2</p><p>Author's Notes: Oh no, I'm not done. Book 3 is in the works. Gotta explain Gos and Ting Li comes back to Japan. Thanks for the reviews and encouragement. Later.</p>
