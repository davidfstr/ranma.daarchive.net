</div><p>Chapter 11</p><p>'Ice Queen and Black Widow'</p><p>The setting sun highlighted three figures as they bounced across the rooftops. Ranma, in male form, and Akane and Ukyo raced to the rendevouz point. The three were dressed in outfits of mottled dark grays, greens and browns. Ukyo, as usual, wore her spatula strapped to her back and a number of pouches were securely fastened to ber belt. Akane wore braces on her forearms and lower legs, a sword was strapped to her back. Only Ranma disdained a weapon though he did wear thick, flat bracelets on his wrists. All wore grim looks on their faces.</p><p>The raced silently across the rooftops.</p><p>Three other figures came into view and both groups swerved to meet each other. They landed on a roof. Ranma couldn't stop a slight smile come to his face. "Nice outfit Pig boy." Ranma commented.</p><p>"Give it a rest little girl." Ryoga shot back. "I think I look good." Ryoga was dressed in dark leather. A leather skirt revealed broad leather strips binding his lower legs. Ryoga may have been wearing a skirt but there was nothing feminine about it.</p><p>"You look like the centerfold for a leather and bondage mag." Akane said with a slight sneer. She looked at Ting Li. "This is your team huh?" She said to Ting Li. "I don't think much of your taste in men but I won't deny his skills." Akane continued. "I suppose Ryoga takes point." She said in a more serious tone.</p><p>"Of course Akane." Konatsu replied. "He is the strongest one here." Konatsu smiled proudly at Ryoga. "On either team."</p><p>"We'll see." Ranma replied. 'Good, they're thinking like a team. Even Ryoga.' He thought. "After we take care of business." He said aloud. "Except this isn't business, this is personal." Ranma would have said more except a soft thump made him turn around.</p><p>Kodachi stood on the edge of the roof winding up her ribbon. Kodachi wore black. A black leotard with a black rose applique. Black gloves and high black boots. Whether there was an expression on her face was not known as a black veil covered it. She walked over to Ranma. "Mine." She said in a whispering hiss. "Revenge is mine."</p><p>Ranma looked into where he thought Kodachi's eyes were for a long moment. Finally he nodded. "You'll run with us." He decided. Kodachi nodded and stood silently off to one side.</p><p>"She's really taking it hard." Ukyo whispered to Akane. Akane nodded. "I think we should keep an eye on her. Just in case." Ukyo added. Akane nodded again. "We better talk to her." Ukyo and Akane walked over to Kodachi.</p><p>Kodachi raised her veil as they approached. Kodachi's eyes seemed to burn into Akane and Ukyo's eyes. "What if it were Ranma?" Kodachi asked before they said anything. Her voice was the same whispering hiss.</p><p>Akane recognized the voice, it was how her voice sounded after she thought she lost Ranma. It was the voice of someone who had cried herself hoarse night after night. "There wouldn't be enough left to bury." Akane replied. "And we wouldn't care if we died to do it." Akane blew out a breath. "Okay Kodachi, we'll help you get close." She said. Kodachi nodded gratefully and lowered her veil.</p><p>"Okay everyone listen up." Ranma said in a bark. "Me and Ryoga are gonna punch a hole in their defenses, the rest of you follow right behind." He looked at Kodachi for a moment then returned his attention to the rest of the group. "Tatewalki and his Ninja will attack from a second position at the same time." Ranma looked at Kodachi again. "The Tomboy, Uk-chan and Kodachi will look for Nakamura."</p><p>The remaining fighters looked at each other before slowly nodding. Ting Li leaned over to Konatsu and whispered something. The transvestite nodded glumly. At Ranma's signal all the fighters leaped into the night sky. Their destination was a small business district. Noichi had his main headquarters there.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki and Kimi sat in the front seat of a red convertable that was parked in an alley. One of Tatewaki's. Tatewaki, himself, was with his Ninjas. Nabiki turned to Kimi. "Last chance to change your mind." Nabiki said quietly. Kimi was pale and nervous looking but she shook her head.<p>"I have to do this Nabs." Kimi said. "Just stay close, okay?"</p><p>"Like a shadow Baby." Nabiki replied. She reached into her blouse and pulled out a necklace. On the end of it dangled a bullet. It was slightly flattened but only slightly. The bullet had been removed from Ky's body. Nabiki looked at the bullet and her face firmed. She tucked it back into her blouse.</p><p>"I thought you were going to give that to Kodachi." Kimi said quietly.</p><p>A brief smile flitted across Nabiki's face before she rearranged her features into their Ice Queen immobility. "I will." She said. "After." Nabiki returned her attention to the building across the street.</p><p>Tatewaki and his team of Ninja landed on the roof. His men quickly fanned out. Tatewaki pulled out his cell phone and punched in a number. "Captain Osigi we are in position." Tatewaki disconnected. "Sasuke." Tatewaki turned and the diminutive appeared before him. "You're with me." Tatewaki drew his sword. He waved the sword over his head and a burst of chi erupted loudly into the air.</p><p>"That's the signal." Ranma hissed. "Come on Pig Boy." He said. "Let's make some noise." Ranma raced off with Ryoga on his heels. They quickly reached the building and raced down the alleyway next to it. They stopped and Ryoga walked over to the wall of the building. He slammed a hamlike fist against the wall. The explosion that followed blasted a hole large enough for both Ranma and Ryoga to walk throught. "Loud enough for you?" Ryoga shouted.</p><p>"What?" Ranma wiggled a finger in his ear. "Ah, better." He said. "Let's go." He raced through the hole in the building with Ryoga on his heels once again.</p><p>Ting Li and Konatsu approached the front door of the building. Konatsu reached into the front of his Ninja garb and pulled out a round object. He threw the ball at the door where it exploded. When the smoke cleared, it revealed the door half hanging off its hinges. Ting Li and Konatsu raced into the building.</p><p>"Our turn." Akane yelled excitedly. "Come on girls, let's go to work." Akane raced across the street and into the building. Kodachi, then Ukyo followed. Ukyo purposely kept behind Kodachi just in case.</p><p>Kodachi followed Akane. To the gymnasts surprise, Akane ignored the door and barreled directly toward the building's brick wall. Kodachi's eyes widened in surprise then in vengeful glee as the dark haired girl blasted right through the brick wall. "Yes." She hissed. "Destroy everything, leave nothing standing." She followed Akane. 'I will avenge your death or die trying.' She thought.</p><p>A tall man appeared at the top of the stairs. Kodachi watched as the man negligently backhanded one of Tatewaki's ninjas. Right behind the man a number of men appeared. They had automatic rifles and they started firing indiscriminately into the crowd below, injuring attackers and defenders alike. "Is that him?" Kodachi said in her hissing voice. She pointed.</p><p>Akane nodded. "We have to take out the gunmen." She shouted in the din. "Uk-chan." She yelled. "Do your stuff." Akane grabbed Kodachi. "Wait until there are distracted." She shouted. "Then it's your turn."</p><p>Kodachi shot a quick glance toward Akane so surprised was she by her former rival's words. Kodachi nodded sharply and Akane let her go. She followed Akane as Ukyo unleashed a barrage of explosive baking powder at the gunmen. While the gunmen were distracted Akane and Kodachi raced toward the stairs.</p><p>Kodachi pulled out her ribbon and snapped it out to grab on to a convenient beam and she vaulted herself into the air and toward the coughing and confused gunmen. Her feet slammed solidly into the bellys of two of the gunmen before she swung back and away. The tall man turned and ran leaving the gunmen to their own devices. Kodachi persued Hikaru as he raced up the stairs. Finally their race took them to the roof.</p><p>Hikaru turned. A look of contempt appeared on his face when he saw the slender form of Kodachi Kuno stalking him angrily. "Who are you?" He sneered. "I thought it was that Akane bitch."</p><p>"Forget Akane Tendo." Hissed Kodachi. "It's me you needs concern yourself with."</p><p>"Needs concern myself with?" Hikaru mimiced mockingly. "Oh you're the stupid rich bitch that Korean shit was fucking." He said in recognition. "Let me guess, you're here to get your revenge." He laughed. "That's rich, the bitch thinks he really loved her." He waved a dismissive hand. "If you weren't rich, you'd be turning tricks for him by now."</p><p>Kodachi said nothing, whatever effect Hikaru's words may have had on her were hidden behind Kodachi's veil. She started twirling her ribbon. The ribbon snapped out suddenly.</p><p>Hikaru reared back in surprise at a sudden stinging sensation. He wiped his hand down his right cheek and looked at it. Blood. He looked up just as the ribbon slashed again. This time he dodged the ribbon. Kodachi's ribbon slashed like a bullwhip. "Enough." Hikaru snapped after he was struck a number of times. He grabbed the ribbon the next time she used it and pulled.</p><p>Kodachi was pulled into the air. If the move was an attempt to surprise her it failed as she spun gracefully through the air. She let go of the ribbon and pulled out, from concealment, two Indian Clubs. So instead of a helpless tumbling girl, Hikaru found himself facing a demoness flying directly toward him with clubs swinging. He flipped away. Kodachi flipped and landed on her feet with her clubs at the ready.</p><p>Hikaru eyes narrowed. 'Skilled.' He thought. He took several deep breaths until he felt a cold calm descend over him. Hitoshi felt his mind take on the crystal efficiency of the Soul of Ice. He charged.</p><p>Hikaru didn't take more than a couple steps before he felt something entangle his feet and he fell to the ground. Hitoshi quickly rolled over and looked at his feet. What appeared to be a sticky rope was wrapped around his ankels. He reached down and grabbed the rope. Under the effects of the cold being generated by the soul of ice the rope became brittle and broke. Hikaru jumped to his feet.</p><p>"Well that didn't work that well." Ukyo said as she stepped out of the shadows.</p><p>"He's mine." Hissed Kodachi.</p><p>"No argument." Akane said as she too appeared out of the shadows. "We're just evening the odds a little." Akane smiled coldly at Hitoshi. "Hello Hikaru ." She said in her baby Aoi voice. "Miss us?"</p><p>"Well, well, Fag Boy's dykes." Hikaru said in a slight sneer. He charged Akane.</p><p>Akane waited until Hikaru was almost on top of her before she reacted. Her fists shot out at Chestnut speed and slammed with the force of twin jackhammers. Hikaru reeled back in pain and surprise. "We made a mistake last time." Akane said coldly. To Hikaru 's further surprise the dark haired girl started putting out cold chi. She advanced on Hikaru . "We're going to correct the mistake."</p><p>Hikaru retreated cautiously. He could sense the other two women taking up position. His mind analyzed the situation coldly and efficiently. 'Ky's bitch is the weak link.' He decided. He spun around and charged Kodachi only to have a faceful of powder thrown into his face by Ukyo. Hikaru struggled to remain in the soul of ice as the powder made his eyes water.</p><p>Kodachi took the opportunity to slam her Indian clubs repeatedly against Hikaru's arms and shoulders. She bounced away as Hikaru tried to grab her. As Hikaru turned he felt the impact of Ukyo's battle spatula. He turned to face the new threat and barely evaded another sudden attack from Kodachi. Hikaru started to spin and leap to evade the triple attack from Kodachi, Akane and Ukyo. Another powerful blow from Ukyo's spatula sent Hikaru to the ground.</p><p>"My this seems familiar." Came a voice. Nabiki strode on to the roof. "You always were predictable Hikaru ." Nabiki said to the fallen Yakusa. "Isn't that true Kimi?"</p><p>"Yeah." Kimi replied as she came on to the roof. "Though I never thought he was stupid until now."</p><p>"Mari. Su." Hikaru growled. He jumped to his feet.</p><p>"Nabiki and Kimi." Corrected Nabiki. "Noichi is neutralized and your men are disarmed. Give up now Hikaru and live." Nabiki said icily.</p><p>"An empty threat." Hikaru scoffed. "You're no killer."</p><p>Nabiki held her hand out to Kimi. Kimi looked at the hand then reached into her waistband and pulled out a pistol. It was the same one she had been given when the pirates had attacked the yacht. She placed the pistol in Nabiki's open palm. Nabiki aimed the pistol at Hikaru . "Are you sure?" Nabiki asked coldly. The pistol held rock steady in her hands.</p><p>"No." Howled Kodachi. "I will not be denied my revenge." She pulled another ribbon from it's concealment on her body and snapped it toward Hitoshi. The ribbon wrapped itself tightly around Hikaru's neck and Kodachi pulled. Hikaru was dragged into the air and flung over the side of the building. Kodachi braced herself as Hikaru's body weight pulled her toward the edge.</p><p>Akane and Ukyo ran over to the side of the building and looked down. Hikaru was struggling against the ribbon wrapped around his neck. They watched as Hikaru's struggles began to weaken before they started to haul the Yakusa martial artist back to the roof.</p><p>"Why do you save him?' Rasped Kodachi angrily.</p><p>"Because they don't want you to go to prison for murder." Nabiki answered for Akane and Ukyo. "Neither do I." She walked over to Kodachi and reached into her blouse. She pulled out the necklace with the bullet hanging from the end. She walked over to Kodachi and placed the necklace around Kodachi's neck. "So you'll never forget." She said to Kodachi.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"We interrupt our broadcast for an important announcement. Police, responding to a disturbance, discovered a number of men who had been injured in what appeared to be a gun battle." The announcer looked at her notes. "Also found were a large cache of weapons, drugs and currency." The announcer pressed a hand to her ear. "This just in; among the people captured was the escaped criminal Hikaru Nakamura."<p>Nabiki snapped off the television. "That should keep Chikato happy." Nabiki said in satisfaction. She turned to see Kimi looking at her speculatively. She held Kimi's eyes for a long moment. Then Nabiki looked down. "I don't know." She said quietly.</p><p>"Neither did I." Kimi said. She walked over to Nabiki. "It scared me for a moment." Kimi leaned her forehead against Nabiki's. "Let's hope we never have to find out, okay Nabs?"</p><p>"Amen Baby." Nabiki replied.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hello Abe." Kodachi said as she approached the door.<p>The burly Abe scrambled to his feet. "Ms. Kuno." He gave the veiled woman a respectful bow. "Please." He hurriedly opened the door. "I hope you'll accept my condolences." Abe said as Kodachi walked through the door. Kodachi stopped and nodded then she proceeded into the club.</p><p>She walked slowly through the club. 'It really does look like a miniature 'Ricks Cafe'.' She thought to herself. A sad smile came to her face. She looked up as a woman hurried over. "Noriko." Kodachi said in recognition.</p><p>Noriko threw herself into Kodachi's arms. "Oh Ms. Kuno." The woman half sobbed. "I'm so sorry."</p><p>Kodachi returned the hug and then gently pushed Noriko away. "Thank you." Kodachi wiped at her eyes from behind her veil. Her hand pressed against her chest where the bullet rested. "I don't know why I came here." Kodachi said quietly. "Somehow it seemed important I did." She looked around. "How is everyone?"</p><p>Noriko smiled briefly. "Better Ms. Kuno." She said. "Would you mind saying hello to the girls?" Noriko asked. "It would really help morale."</p><p>"I think it would help mine as well.' Kodachi said quietly. She nodded and followed Noriko to the bar. Kodachi suddenly found herself mobbed by the women. Each one seemed to offer what comfort she could and, to Kodachi's confusion, they seemed to get some comfort from her.</p><p>Kodachi sat at the bar and sipped a drink. She watched as the women went back to work serving drinks and negotiating other services. She assumed that was the reason every so often a one of the women would go off with a customer toward a stairway. Kodachi's eyes kept being drawn to another door however. Kodachi waved over Noriko. "Who has the key?" She pointed. "To there."</p><p>Noriko shrugged. "It's in the safe." She jerked a thumb behiind the bar. "The Ice Queen put it there." Noriko looked pensive. "She said, to give the key to," She looked down for a second. "Ky's replacement."</p><p>Again Kodachi's hand went to her chest. The macabre trophy seemed comforting somehow. "Replacement." Kodachi said in a low voice.</p><p>Noriko rolled her eyes upward. "Gods I hope it's someone half as good as Ky."</p><p>"Amen sister." One of the working girls who had returned from her rounds and had heard part of the conversation. "We're going to have to hope the Ice Queen can find someone decent." She shivered. "I worked at this one club, I mean you're going to fuck the boss, but this guy was a real freak. I got out of there as quickly as I could."</p><p>"At least you could get out." Another woman said. "Not like some of the Chinese girls."</p><p>"I don't understand." Kodachi said. 'I hope I don't.' She thought.</p><p>Noriko frowned. "Some of the girls." Began Noriko. "You have to understand some of these girls come from really poor families. Their families get a lot of money. Most of the girls have no idea what they're expected to do."</p><p>"They get some of the girls hooked on heroin." Another woman added. "The reluctant ones anyway."</p><p>"None of Ky's girls." Kodachi asked in a horrified tone. "No, of course not. Not Ky." Kodachi answered herself.</p><p>The women around her nodded. "Not Ky." Noriko said in agreement. She sighed. "I wish the ice Queen would decide soon." She leaned over. "Much as I admire the Ice Queen, having her come here to check on things is a little." Noriko paused. "She's scary."</p><p>Kodachi smiled from behind her veil. "She can be." Kodachi agreed. "So Nabiki comes here herself." Kodachi said musingly. To her own surprise the first emotion that came to Kodachi was anger. 'How dare she, this is ' She thought. "This is," She echoed aloud. Kodachi swallowed.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno?"</p><p>"A thought." Kodachi said. "A silly thought." Kodachi's voice faded. "Is it?" She said to herself. Kodachi looked around again. "Ricks Cafe." She said aloud. "He'll change it." She said in horror. "Ky will," Kodachi's hand clenched. "No." She said firmly. "It must remain." Kodachi stood. "It must." She said. Kodachi strode to the door.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno?" Noriko called. "Where are you going?"</p><p>Kodachi stopped and turned slowly. She raised her veil and caught Noriko's eyes with her own. "Is there any of the 92 left?" She asked. Noriko nodded slowly. "Put a bottle on ice." She said. "For when I return." She lowered the veil. Kodachi turned and walked out of the club.</p><p>Noriko stared after Kodachi. She seemed rooted to the spot. One of the working girls got concerned and walked over. "Noriko?" Asked the woman. "You okay?"</p><p>Noriko turned. A huge smile blossomed on her face. "Yeah." She said. "I think you can say that." She looked around. "Oh crap." She exclaimed. "This place is a mess." She grabbed the woman. "Get one of the cleaning people on the floor pronto" She ordered. "Get someone to check, no I'll do that." She babbled.</p><p>"Noriko whatever is the matter?" The woman asked.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno wants the 92." Noriko said ignoring the woman. "And for pity sake, freshen your makeup." She said. "You know how Ms. Kuno is about appearances."</p><p>The other woman pulled a compact out of her purse hurriedly. She looked in the mirror and began correcting a minor flaw. She snapped the compact shut. "Now you got me doing it." She complained. "What's going on?"</p><p>"Ms. Kuno is going to talk to the Ice Queen." Noriko said excitedly. "Don't you see? The reason the Ice Queen hasn't given the territory away is because she was waiting for Ms. Kuno." Noriko smiled. "She wont have to wait much longer." She waved her hands. "Hurry up."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi strode down the hallway of the Kuno mansion and stopped in front of a door. The door led to a room that Nabiki had converted to a conference room for when she wished to meet with her partners. Kodachi looked at the door and her hand went to the bullet that lay against her breast. She took a breath and then opened the door.<p>Nabiki looked up as the door opened. She sat back as she saw Kodachi and looked speculatively at the the veiled woman. The men at the table stood and bowed respectfully to Kodachi. It was apparent that there was more than just the deference that a woman might expect. They had heard about the action against Noichi and Nakamura and who was involved and how.</p><p>Kyoshi looked at Kodachi then at Nabiki. 'An Ice Queen and a Black Widow.' He thought in both amusement and, if he admitted it, trepidation. He leaned over to Tokio. "I think I'm going to win my bet." He said in a very low voice. A resigned look appeared on Tokio's face.</p><p>"Is there a problem Ms. Kuno?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>Kodachi hesitated then noticed an empty seat. Ky's seat. With a deep breath Kodachi walked over and pulled the seat out. Kodachi raised her veil, locked eyes with Nabiki and then sat. She didn't fail to notice the slight upward twitch of Nabiki's mouth. "I'm sorry I'm late Ice Queen." Kodachi said in an even tone. "I lost track of time reviewing my," Kodachi emphasized the word. "territory."</p><p>Again there was a slight twitch to Nabiki's mouth. "Indeed." She said. "Don't let it happen again."</p><p>End Book 3</p><p>Author's Notes: I dunno, I get the feeling you guys didn't like the last chapter.</p><p>I don't know if there will be a book 4 though I am working on a side story for the Engagement Ball. Work is keeping me busy so don't expect it right away. Thanks Ellen, I fixed the error.</p>
