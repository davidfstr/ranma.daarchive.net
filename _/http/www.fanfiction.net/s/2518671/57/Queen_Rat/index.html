</div><p>Chapter 2</p><p>'Adventures in Babysitting'</p><p>A man walked passed the gate to the Kuno mansion. He stopped and lit a cigarette, ignoring the glares of some passerbys, and looked through the gate. Every so often he'd remove a notepad from his jacket , check his watch, and make an entry. He was about to toss away his cigarette when he heard the sound of an approaching car. The man stepped back and allowed the limo to pass. In the back of the limo was a young girl with her face pressed against the passenger window. A look of awe was on the girl's face. The young girl waved to the man as the car passed and the man waved back slowly. The gate opened and the limo drove up the paved driveway to the front steps of the mansion. The gate closed.</p><p>The man watched the girl get out of the car and start up the stairs before turning and walking away. He lit another cigaretted before removing his cell phone. He punched in a number. "It's Shigata, I gotta talk to the boss." The man said. "Boss..." The man stopped. "Yeah, yeah I know that boss. Boss, this is important." He said. "I found her." He said in triumph. "I found the girl."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema carried her small overnight bag up the stairs that led to the front door. As she approached the door opened and a girl of about six or seven stepped out. The girl was dressed in jeans and a pink t shirt. "You must be Pema." The girl said, Pema nodded. "I'm Kiko." The girl introduced herself. She looked at Pema curiously. "Are you really from Tibet?" Kiko asked. Pema nodded again. "Wow." She waved a hand. "Come on in." She said. Kiko started walking and Pema followed.</p><p>"House so big." Pema looked around in awe. "Like temple."</p><p>Kiko nodded cheerfully. "It's great for playing hide and seek." Kiko gushed. "Do you like playing hide and seek?"</p><p>"Pema never play." Pema admitted.</p><p>"Really?" Kiko said in surprise. "Wow."</p><p>"Maybe you teach Pema?" Pema asked the little girl. Kiko nodded. "Oh good." Pema clapped her hands together happily. Kiko giggled. Kiko led Pema along the hallways then stopped at a door. "This is our room." Kiko said. She opened the door.</p><p>"Ohhh." Breathed Pema. "It beautiful." The room was, as were all Kuno bedrooms, large and this one was no exception. Yet the feel of the room was delicate. The furniture were of bamboo and the walls were painted in pastel shades of pink and yellow. One wall was covered with framed photos. Pema walked over and looked at the photos. Most were of a black haired young woman in leotards. The pictures spanned what seemed to be a dozen years.</p><p>"That's Auntie Dachi. This used to be her room." Kiko said. "Isn't she beautiful?"</p><p>Pema nodded. "Hey that you." Pema pointed to a picture showing Kiko in her leotards. Kiko nodded. Kiko's hand went to the pendant around her neck. Pema noticed the movement. "Oh, that pretty."</p><p>Kiko looked down at her pendant. "It's special." She said. "Auntie Dachi gave it to me." Kiko looked up at Pema. "Only Auntie's best girls get one." She said with a proud smile. "She gave mommy one too." Kiko took Pema's hand and led her over to a nightstand next to the bed. On the nightstand was a picture. "This's mommy." The picture showed a woman in her mid to late twenties. She might have been pretty once, even beautiful, but a faint scar along one side of her face and a twisted up lip marred her features. Still Pema was able to see where Kiko got much of her looks. Kiko ran a gentle finger over the picture. Pema could see the little girl's expression start to fall and she walked over and put a comforting arm around the little girl. "Mommy used to be so beautiful, then the bad man hurt her." Kiko said in a trembling voice. "Pema?" She said. "You ever get so sad you thought you'd never be happy again?"</p><p>Pema nodded. "Yes, Pema once sad like that." She said quietly. Pema sighed then abruptly stood. "It too pretty day to be sad." She declared. "We play hide game, yes?"</p><p>Kiko giggled. "Yes."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Kodachi looked up from her desk at the sound of giggling that seemed to echo down the halls of the Kuno mansion. "Now what?" She asked.</p><p>"Sounds like fun, whatever it is." Noriko replied from her laptop.</p><p>"No doubt." Agreed Kodachi. "I have to admit, Akane had an excellent idea." She said. "But it is terribly distracting."</p><p>"Meaning you wish you were out there playing with them?" Noriko asked impishly. She laughed at Kodachi's reluctant nod. "Me too, girl, me too." Noriko stood and walked to the door. Noriko opened the door and stuck her head out. She suppressed a giggle as she watched Kiko and Pema play what appeared to be an elaborate game of tag. "Pema. Kiko." Noriko called. The two girls hurried over. "I hate being the ogre, but you need to tone it down a bit."</p><p>Pema paled. "Sorry Lady Mata." Pema said contritely.</p><p>"It's okay Pema and it's Noriko." Noriko cut the Tibetan girl off. "Or Ms. Mata if you must." She leaned closer. "If Ms. Kuno wasn't so busy she'd probably be joining you." She said in a stage whisper. "To be honest, so would I." She admitted. "Kiko, why don't you and Pema find Yoshi and have him take you out for ice cream?"</p><p>"Ice cream?" Kiko said excitedly. She took Pema's hand. "Come on Pema."</p><p>Noriko watched Pema and Kiko race, giggling, down the hall. With a a fond smile and a sigh, Noriko returned to the office. "Well now we'll get a few hours peace." She said. "That is unless you want to go get ice cream with them." She said coaxingly.</p><p>"Gods, I'd love to." Kodachi replied. She sighed and waved her hand at her paper cluttered desk. "Maybe after we finish this." Kodachi chuckled sourly. "Who'd have thought being a Yakuza lord would entail paper work?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Kiko held on to Pema's hand as they walked along the streets. Each of the girls had an ice cream cone in their free hand. Pema especially was enjoying the, to her, unusual treat. Trailing behind them was a tall slim man with sharp eyes. Yoshi may have considered what he was doing as babysitting but he was too much a loyal Kuno retainer to either resent it or take it lightly, especially when it came to Kiko. Like Noriko before her, Kiko's ability to comfort and cheer Kodachi was something the retainers all cherished. It didn't hurt that Kiko was as devoted to Kodachi as any Kuno retainer and the little girl had quickly become a favorite among the retainers. Pema, on the other hand, was an unknown though being vouched for by Ranma was in her favor.</p><p>Thoughts of Noriko gave Yoshi some pause. He had long ago come to terms with Noriko's relationship with his 'Lady' and was especially gratified to see Kodachi smile and laugh more frequently and more naturally since Noriko had arrived. If anything the only thing that Yoshi resented, if that was even the right term, was that Noriko was no longer available to him. 'Oh well.' Thought Yoshi. 'It was fun while it lasted.' His eyes continually swept his surroundings and even deep in thought he kept his attention focused on what was around him.</p><p>Ninjas, like bodyguards, are trained to recognize when things are wrong or out of kilter. Assassins and, unfortunately, other ninja are trained to blend into the crowd, to not be noticed, until too late. Resulting in an almost Darwinian dance between the bodyguard and the assassin. Yoshi was well trained as both. His eyes narrowed as something caught his attention, something out of place. Yoshi quickly scanned the crowd and detected three men closing in on him and the girls. A further look around and Yoshi saw another two men coming from another direction.</p><p>Yoshi frowned; not because five people were too much for him, they were, though Yoshi was confident her could get the girls to safety, but because it appeared to Yoshi that the two approaching teams were unaware of each other. Yoshi moved a little faster to close the distance between himself and the girls while interposing himself between them and the approaching men. "Kiko. Pema." Yoshi said loudly. "It's time to go." He said.</p><p>"Aw do we gotta, Uncle Yoshi?" Kiko whined.</p><p>"We gotta." Yoshi replied. "Now take Pema's hand while I call for the car." Yoshi pulled out his cell phone. He looked around. "Why don't we wait in here?" He pointed to a tea shop. Yoshi guided the two girls into the tea shop and got them seated before he made his call. "This's Yoshi." He said. "I need a car pronto." He smiled. "yes, exactly. Five of them." He looked at his watch. "Ten minutes? Yeah, that should be fine." Yoshi disconnected and put the phone away. Yoshi sat down opposite the two girls and facing the entrance. 'I can waste ten minutes easy.' He thought. Yoshi ordered tea for the girls. From his position he noted when the men entered. 'I was right.' He thought. 'Two separate groups.' As the men came in at different times.</p><p>One group of three men took a table across the room while the second group, of two, went to the counter. Yoshi snorted. 'Definitely two separate groups.'</p><p>"Uncle Yoshi." Kiko said. "I gotta go."</p><p>"I take her, Mr. Yoshi." Pema volunteered quickly.</p><p>'Perfect.' Thought Yoshi. "Wait a minute." Yoshi said. He waved a waitress over. "Could you take these two young ladies to the rest room?" Yoshi reached into his wallet and pulled out a bill. "For your trouble." He said.</p><p>"Oh no trouble." The waitress said though she took the bill. "Come along girls." Pema and Kiko went off with the waitress while Yoshi remained behind. Each of the groups tracked the girls' progress with their eyes. 'They haven't had a lot of training.' Yoshi realized. 'They're just muscle.' He looked at his watch and smiled in satisfaction.</p><p>When he saw the girls returning, Yoshi walked over and intercepted them halfway. The two groups of thugs had also risen. Yoshi hid a smirk when the two groups of men nearly collided with each other in their haste. The five men stopped and glared at each other. Yoshi leaned over. "Now listen you two, it's going to get very noisy in here soon but I don't want you to be afraid."</p><p>"What's happen, Mr. Yoshi?" Pema asked quietly. "Bad mens?"</p><p>"Bad mens." Agreed Yoshi. He looked up briefly when the door to the tea house opened and two men walked in. Yoshi smiled slightly. "Now remember, don't be afraid." He said reassuringly. Pema wrapped her arms around Kiko and nodded wide-eyed. Yoshi nodded back in approval.</p><p>Yoshi made eye-contact with the two newcomers. They nodded in return. The two men conversed briefly then one reached into his jacket. "Pema. get ready." Yoshi whispered. Pema knelt down and Kiko climbed on the girl's back . The newcomer tossed something. It rolled between the legs of the five, now arguing, men. There was a flash, followed by the sound of firecrackers. "Run Pema." Yoshi shouted. He pushed Pema toward the door. Pema started running while Yoshi ran protectively between the disorganized and coughing thugs and Pema. The other two men joined them and added their protection.</p><p>Yoshi, Pema and Kiko hurried outside and into a waiting limo. As soon as the doors closed the car shot away in a squeal of tires. Yoshi whipped out his cellphone again. "Get me Cook." He said. "It's important." Yoshi looked at Pema and Kiko. The young teenage girl had a comforting arm around the seven year old. Yoshi gave Pema another approving look. "Cook, it's Yoshi." He said. "There was an incident." He said. "No one was hurt." He added quickly. "Please inform our lady."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Both groups were after Pema." Yoshi reported in definite tones.</p><p>"And you're sure it was two groups?" Kodachi asked in tones of repressed anger. They were in one of the smaller parlors. The girls, Pema and Kiko, were in the gymnasium under Yuki's watchful eye.</p><p>Yoshi shrugged uncertainly. "They didn't know the other group was going to be there, that's certain." Yoshi turned a hand over weighingly. "But they did recognize that they were there for the same thing." Yoshi thought for a moment. "And the way they were arguing, I think they knew of each other."</p><p>"Probably would have taken Kiko anyway." Noriko muttered. "As a bonus." She went over to a bar to make herself a drink. "Anyone else?" She asked.</p><p>"Nothing for me, Ms. Mata." Yoshi declined respectfully.</p><p>"Whatever you're having, Noriko." Kodachi said. She leaned back in her chair and tapped her lower lip musingly. "Two groups." She said thoughtfully. "Pema's original captors and," She paused. "The buyer?" She hazarded. "Is there anything else you can tell us?" She asked.</p><p>"Other than the fact that one of the men in the two man group was Chinese, not a lot." Yoshi replied. "Hmm, now that I think on it..."</p><p>Noriko chuckled. "Yeah, you're a Kuno all right." She sobered quickly. "Hmm, is right." She tilted her head. "Dou Gan Shou?" She suggested. "Only Chinese we know that would be interested in Pema." She said. "Maybe he was trying to get his merchandise back."</p><p>"Ms. Mata makes a good point." Yoshi agreed. "And one that supports your conjecture, My Lady." He rubbed his chin in thought. "I think we should explore that lead and see where it takes us." He bowed slightly. "If you will excuse me, My Ladies?" Kodachi nodded and Yoshi left the room.</p><p>Kodachi turned to Noriko and was about to say something but stopped at the look on Noriko's face. "Is there something wrong?" She asked in concern.</p><p>"He said, 'My ladies'." Noriko half stammered. "I mean, I can understand calling Nabiki or Kimi, My Lady, but...me?" She asked plaintively."Aw, come on." She complained. "I'm just, just...well, you know." Noriko shook her head. "Besides, I'm not a Kuno."</p><p>"Of course you are, Noriko." Kodachi smiled and walked over to Noriko. "You became a Kuno the moment you swore oath to me." Kodachi cupped Noriko's chin with her hand. "Did you think I did not know?" She asked seriously. "Oh they tried to keep it secret, they're just not as good at keeping a secret as you are." Kodachi smiled into Noriko's eyes. "Only those who love my lady may enter." Kodachi shook her head. "Cook always did have a flair for the melodramatic."</p><p>"You know." Noriko said in shock.</p><p>"I just said that." Kodachi said in amusement. "What difference does it make?" She asked. "You've been a good friend Noriko. A true friend. That's what matters." She waved a dismissive hand. "The ceremony, was just that, a ceremony."</p><p>"Scared the shit out of me." Noriko complained.</p><p>"As it was intended to." Kodachi dropped her hand to Noriko's shoulder. "They weren't sure of you, not as I was, and they needed some reassurance." Kodachi squeezed Noriko's shoulder. "As did I."</p><p>"All I did was get you laid, you know." Noriko said ruefully.</p><p>"Oh ho ho ho." Kodachi laughed gaily. "True." She said. "But that wasn't all you did and you know that too." Kodachi said pointedly. "Yoshi is just acknowledging a fact." She said. "If I am a Yakusa lord, what does that make you?" She said almost playfully. "No, Yoshi is right, if something happened to me, you would be expected to take over." She said. "You are my second in command after all."</p><p>"Your brother." Noriko began.</p><p>Kodachi interrupted. "My Brother cannot be associated with this part of our endeavors." She said. "And Nabiki would want at least some semblance of seperation between her," Kodachi spread her hands in a shrug. "territory and mine." Kodachi shook her head. "No, it will have to be you." Kodachi's smile became a little sad. "Besides who else would keep Ky's memory alive?" She asked. "Except someone who loved him as well?"</p><p>Noriko looked into Kodachi's eyes and she knew that her own eyes mirrored the expression on Kodachi's face. Noriko nodded slowly. "Who else?" She said quietly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema watched in fascination as seven year old Kiko seemed to dance along the balance beam. She clapped her hands in applause when Kiko executed a backflip off the end of the beam and landed solidly on her feet. "Oh, that so wonderful." Pema said excitedly. "I never see," Pema made a waving motion with her hand as she searched for a word. "Wood dancing." She said finally.</p><p>Kiko giggled. "Wood dancing." She said."That's funny." Kiko grabbed a water bottle and sat down next to Pema. "Wait till you see Auntie Dachi." Kiko said. "She's the best." She declared.</p><p>"You love you Auntie very, very much." Pema said in approving tones. She nodded toward the balance beam. "Train hard to show love, yes?"</p><p>Kiko nodded vigorously. "Yeah." Kiko replied. Kiko's hand went to her spider pendant. "Remember when I asked if you were ever so sad you thought you'd never be happy again?" Kiko asked. "Me and mommy were sad like that, then Auntie came." Kiko looked at the door. "She made Mommy smile and made the bad men go away." Kiko said. "Wouldn't you love someone like that?"</p><p>Pema nodded. "Pema do." She replied. Pema leaned closer to Kiko. "Pema dead once." She said in a near whisper. "In Hell." Pema shook her head sadly. "Pema not know what Pema do wrong to be in Hell, maybe Pema very, very bad in last life. but Pema in Hell."</p><p>Kiko stared wide-eyed as Pema spoke. She swallowed in a suddenly dry mouth. "Really?" Kiko breathed.</p><p>Pema nodded. "Really."</p><p>"Was it hot?" Kiko asked fearfully.</p><p>"Very hot." Pema replied. "And dark, just like stories." Pema shivered. "Sometimes Pema hear screams of others." Pema shivered again. "Sometimes it Pema that scream." Kiko leaned against Pema and Pema put her arm around the little girl. "Pema pray and pray." Pema said. "And one day, prayer answered." Pema looked down at Kiko. "The god Ranma take pity on Pema and take Pema from Hell."</p><p>Kiko looked up. "Uncle Ranma?" Kiko asked in awe. Pema nodded. "Wow." Breathed Kiko. "What happened?" Whispered Kiko.</p><p>"The god Ranma appear from nowhere." Pema continued not knowing why she unburdened herself to a seven year old, but in the short time Pema had known Kiko, she and the seven year old had already formed a bond. "Oh Pema not believe eyes. One second demons try hurt Pema again, next second, they at god Ranma's feet. God Ranma break Pema's chains and then, and then..." Pema's expression became almost ecstatic. "Then we fly."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Pema pressed her face against the passenger window of the limosine as it approached an apartment building. "Home." She said softly. The limo stopped. She could see Yoshi, sitting in the front passenger seat, open his door and step out. Before he could open the rear door, Pema saw three forms appear, seemingly from nowhere. Her face lit up and she hurriedly pushed the door open. Next thing Pema knew she was in the triple embrace of the 'gods'.</p><p>"Pema." Ranma whispered in pleased greeting. His greeting and tone echoed by Akane and Ukyo. Ranma pushed Pema slightly away and looked at her. "Are you alright?" He asked in concern.</p><p>Pema nodded. "I fine, Ranma." She declared. "Mr. Yoshi keep bad mens away."</p><p>Ranma looked over Pema's head to Yoshi. He inclined his head respectfully. "We're grateful." Ranma said seriously.</p><p>"It was an honor." Yoshi replied. He smiled slightly. "My Lady wishes me to convey her hopes that you will not let this minor incident prevent Pema from babysitting Kiko in the future." Yoshi said. "May I add my own hopes in that regard as well." He looked at Pema fondly. "She was very brave." He said. "My Lady also wishes me to ask that you hold off on any deserved retaliation."</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow. "Wait?" He asked. "How long?"</p><p>"Not long." Yoshi replied. "Two weeks at most." He said. "She understands your anger and she shares it but," Yoshi paused. "There are some things that needs be considered."</p><p>"Two weeks?" Akane asked in a grumble.</p><p>"Two weeks." Yoshi replied firmly. "At most." He repeated.</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Two weeks. No more." He agreed. Ranma gave Yoshi a short bow. "Thank you again for bringing Pema home." He scooped Pema up in his arms. "Two weeks." He repeated and leaped into the air. Akane and Ukyo waved and followed.</p><p>Yoshi watched the them reach the roof before stepping back into the limo. It drove away.</p><p>Ranma, with Pema in his arms, landed softly on the roof. Akane and Ukyo joined them a second later. He placed Pema on her feet but kept an arm across her shoulders. They were immediately flanked by Akane and Ukyo. Without saying anything they went back into the apartment.</p><p>Pema gasped when the door of the apartment opened. She could see a large banner across one wall that said, 'Welcome home, Pema.' Pema clapped her hands together gleefully. "Oh it so wonderful." She impulsively hugged first Ranma, then Akane and finally Ukyo. "It good be home." She declared.</p><p>End Chapter 8</p><p>End Part 2</p><p>Author's Notes: Part 3 is still being worked on...I'm almost finished. Thanks for all the great reviews, after all this time and you guys are still reading and reviewing. I'd think you'd have gotten sick of me by now...just kidding. I was on a message board last week, one of those Evolution v Creationism boards, and having an exchange with another poster. We were discussing Intelligent Design. For those who may not know what it is, it's creationism in pseudo-science clothing. The postulate is that life is too complex to have been created by accident and there must be a Designer. Maybe...but the, at least to me, fun corollary to ID is that the 'Designer' can be anything from a diety to the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Which led me to paraphrase Clark's Law, (any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic), to ''Any sufficiently advanced or powerful intelligence is indistinguishable from a god'.</p><p>So you have to forgive Pema for thinking Ranma is a god.</p>
