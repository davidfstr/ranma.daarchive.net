</div><p>Book 3</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>'Here we go again'</p><p>Ranma got up and opened the apartment door in answer to the bell. A wide smile came to his face. "Ting Li." Ranma exclaimed. "You're back. Come on in." He waved a hand into the apartment.</p><p>Ting Li peered around Ranma. "Is Akane or Ukyo here?" She asked in a curiously nervous voice.</p><p>"They went for a jog." Ranma informed the orange haired woman. He frowned. "Problem?"</p><p>"You mind I wait out here until they return?" Ting Li said in a voice that seemed to grow in nervousness.</p><p>Ranma tilted his head. Then he chuckled. "Yeah, well the Tomboy can get pretty physical when's she's mad but she's getting a whole lot better." He informed Ting Li.</p><p>Ting Li smiled briefly. "Not really want to take chance." She replied. "I wait out here okay?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "Sure." He said dryly. "Tell you what, hang on for a moment." Ranma ran back into the apartment. He emerged several minutes later carrying a couple pillows in one hand and a tray holding a teapot and two cups in the other. "Might as well be comfortable." He said. "Kinda silly but," Ranma shrugged and sat on a pillow. He placed the tray on the floor next to him. The apartment was one of a small number and the door opened to the outside a small landing fronted the door.</p><p>"Thank you Ranma." Ting Li replied. She took the cup and sipped the hot liquid gratefully. Ting Li looked at Ranma over the brim of the cup.</p><p>"Like what you see?" Ranma asked in a casual voice.</p><p>"Eep." Squeaked Ting Li and looked down hurriedly. She looked up in annoyance when she heard Ranma snicker. "You got big head, you know that?" She snapped.</p><p>"That's not all that's big about him." Came Akane's voice.</p><p>Ting Li looked up. She jumped to her feet. She bowed quickly. "Akane Tendo I apologize for not call first just got in town." She said hurriedly.</p><p>"She wouldn't come into the apartment." Ranma rolled his eyes. "What is it with you women?" He grumped.</p><p>"Don't mind the jerk." Akane said. She turned as Ukyo came up the stairs. "Hey Uk-chan look who came to visit."</p><p>"What a surprise." Ukyo said calmly. "Why is everyone out in the hall?"</p><p>"Ting Li was afraid to be in the apartment alone with me." Ranma grumped. "What have you been telling her?"</p><p>"The truth." Ukyo replied. "Well, let's not stand out here." She looked at Ting Li. "You're welcome in our home." She told Ting Li. Akane nodded.</p><p>Ting Li sighed in relief. "Thank you." She said. Ting Li sidled passed Ranma and entered the apartment.</p><p>Akane looked at Ukyo. "She's scared spitless." She said in an aside. "Smart girl." Akane followed Ting Li into the apartment. "Well sit down." She ordered Ting Li. She pointed to a chair opposite a couch. "Right there." Ting Li sat on the edge of the chair. "Drink?"</p><p>"Please!" Ting Li fervently.</p><p>Akane grinned. "How about the rest of you guys?"</p><p>"The usual for me sugar." Ukyo sat down on the couch. Ranma sat down next to her. A slightly annoyed look on his face. "Same here." Said Ranma. "It's not like I was gonna jump her as soon as she walked in y'know." He said grumpily. He accepted the drink Akane handed him.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah." Akane smirked. She gave Ukyo and Ting Li their drinks then sat down on Ranma's other side. "You're such a slut." She turned to Ting Li. "You didn't even go home did you?" She made a face when Ting Li shook her head. "Handed them off to someone?"</p><p>Ting Li nodded. "Yes Akane Tendo." Ting Li replied. "It what I supposed to do anyway." She shrugged. "Not under orders to return." She took a large sip of her drink. "I know Council," She said after letting the strong liquor go down. "They want presence in Japan. If they want me return," She smiled slightly. "They send someone."</p><p>Ukyo snorted. "Ambitious little minx." She murmured in wry appreciation.</p><p>Ting Li looked down at her drink. "Tell Ice Queen same thing, you ask, she tell you."</p><p>Akane elbowed Ranma who was still muttering under his breath. "Shut up Ranma." She said cheerfully. "Don't mind him." She told Ting Li. "And what better place to stay then with the people who defeated Cologne." Akane stated. Ting Li nodded. "Not to mention you have access to what Cologne wanted in the first place," She elbowed Ranma again.</p><p>"This true Akane Tendo." Ting Li replied. "But I not Shampoo, I not have claim."</p><p>"Akane'll do." Akane replied. "You know the deal." Akane said seriously. "You do what we do, you eat what we eat and you work where we work."</p><p>"And you don't argue." Ukyo added. "Not until we know you."</p><p>"You gotta earn your way in." Ranma added. "What?" He asked at the look of surprise from Ting Li. "You're cute Ting Li and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't attracted but that ain't enough." He pointed to Akane and Ukyo. "You see these two?" He asked. "I'd trust them with my life." He said. "I have to considering the crazies I attract." He pointed a finger at Ting Li. "If the only reason you're here is to get laid, go home. I'm not interested."</p><p>"What makes you think I here for you?" Ting Li shot back.</p><p>"Wouldn't make a difference." Akane replied. "Ranma, me, Ukyo it doesn't make any difference at all." She said. "What Ranma said goes for all of us."</p><p>"It comes to the same thing anyway sugar." Ukyo said with a chuckle.</p><p>Nabiki looked up at the sound of the apartment's doorbell. "Kimi!." Nabiki called. "Get that will you, I'm busy."</p><p>"Sure baby." Kimi stood up from the couch and walked to the door and opened it. "Yes?" She said. "Can I help, oh gods what happened to you?" Kimi opened the door wider. Standing at the door was a woman who might have been attractive at one point if it wasn't for the thick bandage that covered half of her face..</p><p>"Is the Ice Queen here?" The woman said in a hesitant voice. "I-I heard, I heard." The woman started to cry.</p><p>Kimi took the woman by the arm and escorted her into the apartment. "Nabs get over here." Kimi said urgently.</p><p>Nabiki turned off her computer with a sigh. "I just wish I could get five minutes of uninterrupted time." She grumbled. "Yeah, what is." Nabiki stopped as she saw the woman. "Oh crap." Her anger faded and then quickly reappeared. "Who did this?" She demanded.</p><p>"I'd say her pimp." Kimi said in barely control anger. She looked at the woman. "Am I right?" The woman nodded hesitantly. Kimi guided the woman to a couch and had her sit down.</p><p>"I'm, I'm sorry for disturbing you." The woman have sobbed. "But I didn't know where else to go." She said. "I wasn't cheating him, I wasn't." She said.</p><p>"Even if you were, he had no call to do that to you." Kimi said firmly. With gentle fingers Kimi peeled back the bandage to look at the wound. "Bottle." She decided. The woman's nod confirmed her guess. "Bastard."</p><p>"What am I going to do?" The woman said in a tear stained voice. "No one's going to want me now."</p><p>"Worry about that later, honey." Kimi said soothingly. "First thing you're going to do is have a doctor look at it."</p><p>"I can't afford," The woman began only to be stopped by Nabiki.</p><p>"Don't worry about that either." Nabiki said firmly. "What's your name?"</p><p>"Koko." The woman replied.</p><p>"And his name, Koko?"</p><p>"Toshio Wasahara." Koko replied. "He works for Ky Young Ji."</p><p>"Worked for Ky Young Ji." Nabiki corrected. "That's assuming you're asking me to step in." Nabiki looked at Kimi. "Put her in the guest room Kimi, I have a few phone calls to make."</p><p>"Come along honey." Kimi said gently. "You can stay here for now."</p><p>"I couldn't." Koko began only to be stopped by Kimi.</p><p>"You can, you will and you won't argue." Kimi said firmly. She took Koko by the arm and led her to the back of the apartment. "Make your calls Nabs." Kimi said. "I'll stay with Koko for awhile."</p><p>Nabiki nodded distractedly as she pulled out her cell phone. "Doc?" She said when the phone was answered. "Oh hi sis, look I need Tofu to look at someone." She said brusquely. "Here in my apartment." She nodded. "Thanks sis, love you." Nabiki disconnected and dialed another number.</p><p>Akane nearly slammed the telephone down. She took some calming breaths before she spoke. "We got a job to do." She said coldly. "And I am not in the mood to be reasonable." She looked at where Ukyo was sitting on the couch. "A certain pimp, named Toshio Wasuhara just got me pissed."</p><p>"What did he do sugar?" Ukyo stood and walked over to a closet and pulled out her spatula and slung it across her back.</p><p>"Cut up the face of a hooker." Akane replied. "Where's Ranma and Ting Li?" Ukyo pointed upward. "Okay, let's get them and go." Akane stormed out of the apartment without checking if Ukyo was following. She didn't need to as Ukyo was right on her heels. Akane strode up the stairs angrily until she reached the roof. "Ranma!" She yelled.. "Get your butt over here.'</p><p>Ranma bounced over with an annoyed look on his face. "We were just sparring." He protested. "Keep working on that kata, Ting Li." He called over his shoulder."</p><p>"I'm not mad at you Ranma." Akane said "One of Ky Young Ji's pimps cut up a hooker."</p><p>Ranma's eyes narrowed. He spun around. "Ting Li forget what I just said, get over here." Ranma waited until the Joketsuzoku warrior reached them. "We got a job to do." Ranma told the warrior. "You're coming with us."</p><p>"Of course Ranma." Ting Li replied. "What job?"</p><p>"Showing everyone that the Ice Queen makes good on her promises." Akane replied. "Nabiki put every sex worker, regardless of whose territory, under her protection; stripper, hooker or masseuse, it doesn't matter, anyone messes with them they mess with us."</p><p>"This is something we all agree on." Ukyo added. "We've been working in that world too long to think it's all fun and games. The girls get hurt and no one cares. Some even think the girl deserves it just because of what she does. Most cops certainly think so."</p><p>"Not Chikato." Ranma said in defense of the Police Lieutenant.</p><p>"No, not Chikato but he's more the exception, isn't he?" Ukyo came back. "Anyway, they continue to get hurt."</p><p>"And that's gonna change." Ranma said. "How do you wanna play this Tomboy?" He grabbed his pigtail and looked at it. "I don't think leaving him naked on a water tower is gonna cut it."</p><p>"Break leg?" Suggested Ting Li. "Up to me I break both arms and both legs." Ting Li noticed the other three were staring at her. She flushed. "Sorry talk out of turn."</p><p>Ukyo snorted in amusement. "Yeah you did, luckily for you I like the idea." She grinned nastily at Ting Li. "But you're still getting punished." Ukyo started to snicker. "Nothing brings a pimp running faster than finding a new girl working in his territory. A new girl without a pimp."</p><p>Akane and Ranma laughed. "Better make her a popular new girl." Akane said. She gave Ting Li a look that made the Amazon shiver. "We'll need a couple of cars."</p><p>"And I know exactly what outfit she'll wear." Ranma said with his own wicked smile.</p><p>Ting Li shivered as a sudden breeze whipped around the corner she was standing on. Ting Li wobbled slightly on her high heels as she walked from one end of the block to the other. Her short orange skirt and midriff baring orange blouse offered no protection from the wind. 'I can't believe I'm doing this.' Ting Li thought in a combination of annoyance and embarrassment. Much to her relief so far no one had approached her. Unfortunately, for Ting Li, it seemed that was about the change as a car slowed as it neared. The window rolled down. Ting Li took a breath. 'Okay here goes nothing.' She walked over to the car. Her eyes widened when she realized it was Ranma behind the wheel.</p><p>"Lean closer." Ranma hissed. Ting Li placed her hands on the top of the car and leaned her head toward the window. "Nice pose." Ranma said in approval. "Good you didn't get flustered. Right now we're pretending to be negotiating."</p><p>Ting Li smiled wryly and nodded. "So you looking for date?" She smiled at Ranma's laugh. Her smile turned wry. "What would happen if you real customer?" Ting Li asked.</p><p>Ranma laughed again. "Get in the car." He said. "We've agreed on a price." Ranma leaned over and unlocked the passenger side door and Ting Li got in the car. Ranma drove off slowly. "What would have happened would have depended on how important you thought maintaining your cover was." Ranma offered as he drove.</p><p>"You not kidding are you?" Ting Li asked quietly. She took a breath. "No, I suppose you not." She said a moment later when Ranma didn't answer. "Where we going?"</p><p>"Just some place to hang for a reasonable amount of time." Ranma turned a corner into a poorly lit side street. He parked the car in a space that was partially shielded from view. "This looks like a good spot." He reached behind the front seat and pulled out a thermos. "Here, Uk-chan made you some soup."</p><p>"I thank her when see her." Ting Li said fervently and poured herself some of the hot soup. "Ahh, that taste good." She took another sip.</p><p>Ranma reached into his pocket and pulled out an envelope. He reached into the envelope and pulled out some currency of mixed denominations. "Put this in your purse." Ranma instructed. "If Toshio shows it wouldn't look right if you didn't have any money on you." Ranma grinned. "This way you'll look like you've had a busy night." Ranma looked at his watch. "Another ten minutes then I'll drive ya back."</p><p>"Why we do it this way?" Ting Li finished the soup Ukyo had made and closed the thermos. "I sure we could find where he live."</p><p>"Oh sure." Ranma replied. "But this way is more fun." Ranma started up the car and drove Ting Li back to where he had picked her up and let her out. Ranma drove around the corner, down several blocks and then parked the car. He then took to the roofs and raced back to where Akane and Ukyo were waiting.</p><p>"How's she doing?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Scared out of her mind and determined not to show it." Ranma replied. "She's got some guts that girl." He nodded toward the street. "Anything?"</p><p>"Quiet Ran-chan." Ukyo reported. "Wait a minute, I spoke too soon." She pointed. A late model sports car cruised slowly down the street.</p><p>Ting Li looked up as the sports car pulled up next to her. 'I don't know if I can do this.' She thought. 'No I must. I must prove myself to them.' Ting Li put a smile on her face and sauntered, in what she hoped was a sexy manner, toward the car. Her smile faded when a tall and powerfully built man stepped out of the car. He walked over to Ting Li and grabbed Ting Li's purse. "Hey." Ting Li protested. "Give that back."</p><p>"Shut up bitch. You work my streets you work for me." He quickly rifled through Ting Li's purse and extracted a wad of bills. He put the money in his jacket pocket and tossed the now empty purse back to Ting Li. "Now get back to work."</p><p>"Give that back." Snapped Ting Li angrily. "That mine." Toshio moved faster than Ting Li expected and the back handed slap sent her to the ground. Ting Li wiped her mouth. "Ice Queen hear about this." Ting Li said threateningly.</p><p>Toshio laughed. "What's that cunt going to do about it?" Toshio sneered. His sneer became a snarl. "Seems to me, someone needs to know who's in charge." He strode over to Ting Li and snapped a kick. Ting Li blocked the kick with her leg and sprung to her feet. It quickly became apparent that Toshio was a veteran of street brawls and Ting Li's kicks seemed to have only limited effect.</p><p>The orange haired amazon jumped away and paused to assess the situation. 'If I can't beat this idiot I should return to China.' She thought. "I said, give that back." Growled Ting Li. Ting Li seemed to blur as she charged the pimp.</p><p>"Not exactly splitting cat hair but similar." Ranma commented from the shadows. He waved a hand. "Shall we?"</p><p>"Well we should at least make sure she doesn't get hurt." Akane grumped.</p><p>"Jealous?" Ranma asked curiously.</p><p>"Yes." Akane admitted in a reluctant hiss.</p><p>"Don't be." Ranma said. "She's cute but I still don't know if she'll watch my back. No matter what." He smiled warmly at Akane and then shifted his gaze to Ukyo. "Not like you two." He turned and strode out of the shadows; Akane and Ukyo on his heels.</p><p>Ukyo looked at Akane. 'She's getting moody again.' Ukyo decided. She smiled. 'Poor Toshio.' She thought cheerfully. 'Just what Akane needs right now.'</p><p>"Is this man bothering you sister?" Ranma lisped. He seemed to ooze toward Toshio. Ranko's stage strut performed by Ranma's male body could be disconcerting even if you knew Ranma's dual nature. Toshio stepped backwards. "Oh don't run away baby. The party hasn't even started."</p><p>"Yeah." Akane's voice came from behind and Toshio spun around. "Not all the guests are here."</p><p>"Sorry." Ukyo said from the side. "Traffic, you know?" With Ting Li opposite her Toshio was now boxed in. "Did I miss anything?"</p><p>"Who are you jokers?" Toshio snarled. He made to reach for his jacket.</p><p>"I wouldn't if I were you?" Ranma waved an admonishing finger. "Now you know the rules, treat the girls nice and the Ice Queen won't interfere." He stopped just out of arms distance from Toshio. "You broke the rules Toshio." Ranma shrugged. "Now if you had just roughed her up, I might have let you off with a warning." Ranma seemed to blur and Toshio felt pain blossom along his arm. "That would have been the warning." He shook his head. "But then you had to go cut that girls face."</p><p>"Girl like that lives on her looks." Akane stepped forward and her leg lashed out. Toshio fell to the ground. "Do you have any idea how much I hate creeps like you?" She hissed. With a visible effort Akane got herself under control. "Shut up." She growled at the screaming pimp. "You may not believe it but this is your lucky day."</p><p>"Lucky?" Toshio gasped in disbelief.</p><p>"Yeah lucky." Akane replied. "You're probably gonna live." She squatted down and reached into Toshio's jacket pockets. She extracted his wallet and took out all the money and placed it in her bra. "However, I'd look for a new line of work if I were you." Akane grabbed the pimp by the collar of his jacket and lifted him into the air. She turned and tossed Toshio and he landed, hard, against his sports car.</p><p>"Hey save some for me and Tingly." Ukyo called. "You know how carried away you can get."</p><p>"Ice Queen I protest." Ky Young Ji said angrily. "I thought you had no problem with prostitution."</p><p>"If you remember." Nabiki said coldly. "I said I had no problem with it as long as the girls weren't being abused." Nabiki leaned back in her chair and reached out a hand. Kimi slapped a folder into Nabiki's hand. Nabiki placed the folder on the table in front of her and opened it. "Forty seven stitches, Ky."</p><p>"The bitch was holding out." Ky Young Ji shot back. As his name implied he was Korean. Despite his birth he had carved out a successful and substantial territory.</p><p>Nabiki slammed her hand down on the table. "Then you should have spoken to me first." Nabiki snarled. "And cutting her face means she is producing nothing. Nothing." She said in emphasis. "My doctor tells me she's going to have a scar. That means she's never going to make any money for you or anyone ever again."</p><p>"Yeah?" Ky snarled back. "And Toshio is going to be laid up for months."</p><p>"Tough." Nabiki replied contemptuously. "None of this would have been necessary if you kept a tighter rein on Toshio. On all your people." She stared at Ky Young Ji coldly. "Did you think it was just talk? I meant it then and I mean it now, the girls are under my protection." Nabiki closed the folder with a snap. "Just be glad I'm not asking you to apologize, personally."</p><p>"You wouldn't." The Korean gangster said in disbelief. He pulled back when a knife suddenly was thrown on the table.</p><p>"Don't tempt your fate." The until now silent Tatewaki rumbled. "I saw the woman's face. Be glad the Ice Queen is so forgiving. I would not be as kind." Tatewaki nodded toward the knife on the table. "Nor would I accept just a finger as an apology."</p><p>"You're crazy, all of you." Ky Young Ji said in a shaken voice. "No one does that anymore." He turned in his seat to face two other silent people. Tokio Wasamura and Kyoshi Nerumi sat silently. Tokio looked at the dagger and picked it up.</p><p>"Maybe that was a mistake." Tokio said musingly. He looked at Nabiki for a long moment before placing the knife carefully in front of Ky Young Ji. "All I know is a happy whore is a productive whore. I have a lot of upset girls on my hands." The smile he gave Ky Young Ji was not friendly. "But I'll have to disagree with the rich boy, a finger would be enough."</p><p>"Would you do it?" Ky Young Ji shot back.</p><p>"I don't plan on screwing up." Tokio replied coolly. "But if I did," Tokio picked up the knife again. "I think I would." He turned the knife in his hand. "If only because I don't think of myself as," He smiled and gave Nabiki a slight bob of his head. "A thug."</p><p>Nabiki nodded in acknowledgment. To Nabiki's surprise Tokio was indeed not a thug. Oh he was crude and violent but he appeared to have his own code of honor and stuck to it. Ky Young Ji on the other hand. Nabiki suppressed a sigh. "Perhaps it would be best we sever our association."</p><p>Ky Young Ji blanched. "Over a whore?" He said in disbelief.</p><p>"Over a principle." Corrected Nabiki. "And over my word."</p><p>Ky Young Ji looked around and found, not sympathy, but expectant curiosity. He swallowed nervously. 'Shit.' He thought in anger and fear. 'I wouldn't last a week.' He knew that even with Nakamura gone his territory was at risk. There were other families. There were gangs trying to become families. Once it became known her was no longer allied with two of the most powerful. 'Three.' Ky Young Ji corrected himself. 'She'd let me go. I could walk out of here and no one would stop me, but I'd still be dead.' Ky Young Ji looked around the table. Of all the words that were spoken Tokio Wassamura's stung the most. 'A thug, they think I'm nothing more than a thug.'</p><p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out a handkerchief to wipe off the sweat. There was a susseration of indrawn breath. Ky Young Ji looked at the handkerchief. A cold sweat broke out on the Korean's forehead. He looked at Nabiki. The woman's face was totally devoid of expression. She looked the living embodiment of her name. Ky Young Ji looked at the handkerchief again. It was white.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw the knife and another handkerchief being placed on the table in front of him. Ky Young Ji stared at the knife for a long moment. "I am not a thug." He said quietly.</p><p>Ky Young Ji unfolded his handkerchief then knotted two corners around the little finger of his left hand using his teeth to pull it as tight as possible. The tip of his finger turned white. Ky Young Ji placed his hand on the table and picked up the knife. To both his pride and astonishment his hand was steady. He placed the edge of the knife against the joint of the little finger. He looked up and caught Nabiki's eyes. "Please accept my apology, Ice Queen." The knife moved.</p><p>Nabiki held Ky Young Ji's eyes. To her grudging admiration the man's eyes barely flickered, though his face did turn white. She kept her eyes locked on Ky Young Ji's as the gangster, the Yakusa, wrapped his maimed finger with the handkerchief. The, now bloody, second handkerchief held the severed end of his finger. Tatewaki walked over and folded the severed joint in the rest of the handkerchief and, with a bow to Ky Young Ji, took the folded handkerchief and placed it in front of Nabiki.</p><p>"Apology accepted." Nabiki said cooly. "We will speak no more of this." She said to the assembled crime leaders. "Someone get Ky a drink."</p>
