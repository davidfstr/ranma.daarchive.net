</div><p>Chapter 4</p><p>'Number one girl'</p><p>Hikaru Nakamura was doing hand-stand pushups in the corner of his cell. The correctional facility he was in consisted of small cells, barely large enough for the single occupant. Hikaru had been in this cell since he was rearrested. Hikaru dropped lightly to his feet and began a series of stretching exercises.</p><p>His exercises completed Hikaru dropped to the floor and assumed a cross-legged full lotus position. His hands rested lightly on his knees. A few deep breaths and the room suddenly developed a sheen of condensation as the temperature dropped. Hikaru breath formed long slow plumes of vapor in the cool air as he entered the Soul of Ice. His thoughts stilled and his mind became clear and Hikaru extended his senses. Something had caught his attention earlier in the day and now was as good a time to analyze it. 'I was being watched.' He decided. A wry smile came to his lips. 'Ah, of course.' Hikaru stilled his mind. And waited.</p><p>It was just after two in the morning when the door to his cell opened. "I see you've been practicing." Said a raspy voice approvingly. "Ready to leave son-in-law?"</p><p>Hikaru opened his eyes. "Hello Honored Elder Cologne." Hikaru got to his feet. "I'm ready."</p><p>Cologne looked at the Yakusa lord. Hikaru waited patiently. She nodded. "Yes, I think you just might be." She said. "Come along." She hopped out on her staff. The hallways seemed unnaturally quiet yet the staff made no sound as the traversed the hall. They came upon the body of a guard. "The drug used will erase all memory of this evening. No one will know of your escape until they check your cell. We will be well gone by then."</p><p>"Cameras." Hikaru pointed out.</p><p>"Taken care off." Cologne replied. "They will show nothing unusual." Cologne glanced over to Hikaru. "You could have left at any time." She commented in an off-hand tone.</p><p>"True." Agreed Hikaru. "But I decided to see if you still had some use for me."</p><p>Cologne cackled. "Indeed I do, son-in-law. Indeed I do." They came to the main junction of the prison. More guards lay unconscious.</p><p>Shampoo stood waiting. Her arms were crossed and her face registered impatience. "There you are." She said. "We go." She turned on her heel and marched out. Hikaru and Cologne followed.</p><p>"She doesn't seem happy to see me." Hikaru commented.</p><p>"She has other things on her mind." Cologne answered. "Do not concern yourself over it." She said. "You have your own concerns."</p><p>Hikaru nodded. "Yes I do." He looked at Cologne. "Does this mean the Council is backing you again?"</p><p>"Not exactly." Cologne answered easily. "Rather it's a matter of them not interfering." She shrugged. "Ting Li has not been unsuccessful and the money she sends home is considerable." She said. "And having the ear of the Ice Queen is important in its' own right."</p><p>"Then we must convince them that having my ear is just as important." Hikaru replied gravely.</p><p>"Truly you have grown son-in-law." Cologne said. "That's exactly what we must do." They exited the prison and into a waiting car. Shampoo was already inside. Hikaru sat down next to Shampoo while Cologne took the facing seat. As soon as Cologne was settled Shampoo rapped on the window that divided the back half of the limo from the driver. The car drove off.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"It's been a month." Nabiki said irritably. "A month since Hikaru escaped." She said. "Again." She looked around the table at the assembled Yakusa lords. She noted similar looks of irritation on the faces of some of her allies. "Kyoshi, Tokio. Anything?"<p>"No Ice Queen." Kyoshi Narumi replied. "I've had my people looking everywhere without success."</p><p>"If he's anywhere near Tokyo we should have found him by now." Tokio added.</p><p>"Then perhaps he is not in Tokyo." Kodachi said from behind her veil. "It would be too difficult, let alone too dangerous, for him to attempt to set up any operation where we can find it." Kodachi leaned back in her chair. "Ting Li has said it's quiet in all the Chinese communities." She said almost to herself.</p><p>Nabiki looked at Kodachi sharply. "There's no evidence Cologne was involved." Nabiki also leaned back, "Yet," She said musingly.</p><p>TokioWasuhara gave the two women a reluctant look of admiration. 'If they were men they'd rule Japan.' He thought. It was a well worn thought. Tokio was a tough, vulgar, almost brutish man and normally would not take instructions from any woman but he wasn't stupid and he recognized genius when he saw it. He leaned forward. "Then I suggest we assume she is involved." He said gruffly. "Better safe than sorry."</p><p>Nabiki leaned forward. "I agree Tokio." She gave the Yakusa lord a brief nod that conveyed respect. She rubbed her nose. "If the old ghoul is involved she's going to have weapons." She grumbled. "Lover?"</p><p>"I'll have Captain Osigi increase patrols." Tatewaki rumbled. He gave a small smile. "He's been itching for some action." He said. "And to play with his new toy." His smile became wider. "That last pirate he captured had, in the Captain's words, a sweet little ship." He shook his head. "And now even more heavily armed than the yacht."</p><p>"We'll need it." Nabiki said firmly. "Okay I think we know what we need to do." She said. "Is there anything else that needs to be discuss? No?" She rose and the assembled Yakusa lords rose in response. "In that case gentlemen, ladies, we are ajourned." She looked at Kodachi. "Thank you again for the use of your club, Ms. Kuno."</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "I was honored you accepted." She looked at the Yakusa lords. "Please feel free to avail yourselves of anything the club has to offer." Kodachi pressed a button on the wall. The door opened almost immediately and Noriko stuck her head in.</p><p>"Is your meeting over Ms. Kuno?" Noriko asked. Kodachi nodded. "I have a section reserved for the gentlemen." She waved her hand to indicate the door. The Yakusa lords filed out. Noriko paused at the door. "I have three of the girls already at the table." She announced to Kodachi. "I will join them and make sure everything goes smoothly." She said. "And make sure the gentlemen are happy." She smiled at Kodachi then left.</p><p>"Of course you will." Kodachi said to the closed door.</p><p>Kimi, who had been sitting quietly next to Nabiki taking notes looked up and frowned slightly. She leaned over to Nabiki. "I think I detected a little note of jealousy there." She whispered. "I don't think Kodachi likes the idea of Noriko entertaining."</p><p>Nabiki looked at the veiled woman. "Maybe." Nabiki replied in the same tone. "But they're not lovers." She looked at Tatewaki. "Lover, would you mind making sure the boys don't get out of hand?"</p><p>Tatewaki grunted. "That probably is a good idea." He rumbled. He leaned closer to Nabiki. "Tell me about it later." He said quietly. "I do worry about her." Nabiki nodded and Tatewaki left.</p><p>Nabiki waited until the door closed before standing and walking over to Kodachi. "I don't know about you but I could use a drink." Nabiki said. "Is there any of the '98 left?"</p><p>Kodachi seemed to shake herself. "Where are my manners?" She said in dismay. "I'll have Noriko." Kodachi stopped. "Oh dear. I forgot." Kodachi looked at the closed door then walked over to a bar set up in the corner of the room. Kodachi ducked behind the bar and stood a moment later holding a bottle. "I think there's a bottle opener somewhere."</p><p>"Let me." Kimi said easily. "Why don't you sit?" Kimi took the bottle from Kodachi. "Sit." Kimi repeated. Kimi waited until Kodachi joined Nabiki before she started rattling the drawers looking for a cork screw. "Ah found it." She announced. Within moments she had served Nabiki and Kodachi before filling her own glass and sat down next to Nabiki. "So, want to talk about it?"</p><p>"I-I don't know what," Kodachi broke off. She looked at Kimi. "Do you miss it?" She asked instead. She waved a hand. "The business." She said in explanation.</p><p>"You mean turning tricks?" Kimi said easily. "Not really." She said. "But that's only because I have everything I need." She gave Nabiki a quick but fond look. "To be honest, if it wasn't for Nabs, I'd still be hooking and not thinking twice about it." Kimi sipped her wine then leaned forward and place the glass on a table. "Do you mind listening to a little piece of advice?" Kodachi hesitated then waved Kimi on. "Jealousy will kill you in the long run."</p><p>"Jealous?" Kodachi said in disbelief. "I am not jealous." Kodachi paused. "I don't think of her that way." She said almost angrily.</p><p>"That's what it looks like to me." She waved a dismissive hand. "I'm not talking about sex." She said. "You're as straight as they come Kodachi." She said firmly. "But it's obvious it bothers you."</p><p>Kodachi looked down. "I-I." Kodachi swallowed. "Yes." She whispered. "She's better than that."</p><p>"Better than what?" Kimi persisted. "Being a whore?" She shook her head. "It's what she is and what she does." Kimi said. "But there's one thing you're not seeing." She waited until Kodachi looked up. "She's doing it for you."</p><p>"Me?" Kodachi said in disbelief.</p><p>"You." Kimi asserted.</p><p>"You should be happy Kodachi." Nabiki said with a smile. She placed a hand on Kimi's shoulder.</p><p>"Happy?"</p><p>"Very happy." Nabiki insisted. "You've got yourself a Kimi." She and Kimi exchanged looks. Nabiki looked back at Kodachi. "Like Kimi said, we're not talking about sex, though it's part of it. We are talking about having a partner."</p><p>"Someone to watch your back." Kimi added.</p><p>"And someone to be your friend." Nabiki finished. She smiled. "If I didn't already have Kimi, I'd be jealous."</p><p>"A friend." Kodachi said wistfully. Her hand touched the bullet under her dress. 'Are they right Ky?' She thought. 'Am I being jealous?' Kodachi closed her eyes for a minute. When she opened them, she stood. "Please feel free to enjoy the hospitality of the club." She said to Nabiki and Kimi. "There is something I must attend to." She turned and walked out of the office.</p><p>Kimi and Nabiki watched her go. Nabiki turned to Kimi. "She's going to keep Noriko at the table." Nabiki predicted. "That's for certain."</p><p>"Yep." Kimi agreed. She looked at Nabiki. "Jealous huh?"</p><p>"I said if I didn't already have you." Nabiki smiled regally. "But since I do, I have no need to be jealous."</p><p>"Prove it." Kiki said in her own imperious tones. She squealed when Nabiki pulled her close very quickly and then purred when Nabiki captured her mouth with hers. Kimi melted against Nabiki. "Okay." She said in a happy sigh. "I'm convinced."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi walked briskly across the club and to the table occupied by the Yakusa lords. To her relief, Noriko was still at the table. Actually all the girls were but Kodachi only was concerned about Noriko. Noriko, Kodachi observed, was being monopolized by her brother. Kodachi frowned as she approached. "Brother." She said.<p>"Ah Sister." Tatewaki grumbled cheerfully. "We were just speaking of you and here you are." Tatewaki stood. "I need to check on something. Would you mind holding my place until I return?" Without waiting for an answer Tatewaki strode away. Kodachi rolled her eyes behind her veil than sat in the vacated seat. "I hope my brother wasn't pestering you." She said to Noriko.</p><p>"Oh not at all Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied. "Did you need something?"</p><p>"No." Kodachi replied. "I just came out to see how," Kodachi paused. "Things were going." She leaned closer to Noriko. "I hope you don't mind, but I'd prefer if you didn't," Kodachi paused again. "Entertain." She said finally. "I really can't spare you."</p><p>Noriko leaned closer. "Are you sure?" She asked. "I mean the girls aren't going to complain, these boys tip heavily and all that, but," She stopped when Kodachi put a hand on her elbow. "Ms. Kuno?"</p><p>"Please Noriko." Kodachi said. "Not tonight. Not with them." She gave the assembled Yakusa lords a quick glance. The gangsters seemed in good spirits and were not paying any attention. "Especially not with them." She looked back at Noriko. "Please." She repeated.</p><p>Noriko looked at the veiled woman for a long moment, then she raised a hand. One of the free girls hurried over. "Yes Ms. Mata?" Her eyes widened when she saw Kodachi. "Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Please join the other girls Ami." Noriko said. "Ms. Kuno has decided to join us and I feel I should be the one to attend to her needs."</p><p>"Of course Ms. Mata." Ami dimpled a smile. "No explanation required." She looked at Noriko and giggled. Then walked over and sat down next to one of the gangster lords.</p><p>Noriko rolled her eyes and then returned her attention to Kodachi. "She's worked out well." She said to Kodachi. "But she is a horrible gossip." She informed Kodachi.</p><p>"Gossip?" Kodachi blushed behind her veil. "She thinks, that is, oh dear." Kodachi stopped. "I guess that's what it looked like." She looked at the expression of Noriko's face. "You thought it too." She said. "Noriko." Kodachi scolded. "And you would, wouldn't you?"</p><p>"Well of course." Noriko replied with a touch of exasperation in her voice. "That's what I do." She said. Noriko looked down the table as the girls made sure the gangsters' needs were met. Several seats had just become vacant as some of the needs were being met in more private settings. "We need more girls." Noriko mumbled. She turned back to Kodachi. "I hope I didn't offend you Ms Kuno but, well, I really wouldn't mind." She said. 'In a heartbeat.' She thought.</p><p>Kodachi licked her dry lips. "N-no, not at all." She replied. "Just surprised." She shook her head. "And maybe a little flattered." She admitted. Kodachi shook her head again. "But no." She smiled slightly behind her veil. "But I would like you to come to the mansion this weekend." She said. "Maybe we could just talk." Kodachi hesitated. "Like friends."</p><p>Noriko tilted her head and looked at Kodachi for a long time. "What time would you like me to show up?" She said finally.</p><p>Kodachi raised her veil. "I'll send a car." She said.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru Nakamura deftly evaded Xian Pu's attack with an almost distracted air. It wasn't that he wasn't paying attention but rather he was so deep into the Soul of Ice he was able to divide his attention without losing his awareness of where Xian Pu was and what she was doing.<p>For her part, Xian Pu, was totally concentrated on Hikaru. Despite her best efforts Xian Pu had never been able to really master the cold center of the Soul Of Ice. Oh she could enter the Soul of Ice and generate cold chi but not for long and not to the extent Hikaru had achieved. Instead she concentrated on her other attacks. Suddenly Xian Pu seemed to split into two and attacked Hikaru from two sides.</p><p>Cologne cackled softly to herself as she watched her two pupils spar against each other. 'Excellent. Excellent.' She thought in self satisfaction. 'Now if only I can get them to fight together as well as they fight against each other.' She smiled to herself. 'But that will come in time.' Cologne turned from the match and pogoed on her staff to an old battered desk. On it was a map of Hokkaido. 'Ripe for the picking.' She thought in satisfaction. 'Let Nabiki have Tokyo.' She thought. "For now." She said aloud. "In the meantime." She turned. "Enough training you two." She said loudly. The sparring match stopped as if a plug had been pulled. "Hikaru, tomorrow you will meet with the leader of a local gang."</p><p>"I've read his file." Hikaru said dismissively. "A thug." He walked over to a bench and picked up a bottle of water.</p><p>"Indeed." Cologne agreed. "See that this is your last meeting with him."</p><p>Hikaru nodded impassively. "I had the same thought." He did not smile.</p><p>"What I do?" Xian Pu asked impatiently.</p><p>"I have to admit, Nabiki Tendo has the right of it." Cologne said. She pogoed over to Xian Pu. "You will be responsible for all prostitution and you will emulate the Ice Queen in her approach."</p><p>"What if they no want join?" Xian Pu asked.</p><p>"Oh one or two random attacks should suffice to demonstrate the importance of having your protection." Cologne cackled. "Especially when you will then demonstrate you're effectiveness in delivering the culprit." She cackled again. "What's left of him."</p><p>"With the additional benefit of giving the pimps the same incentive to work for me." Hikaru added. "The whores can sell the drugs along with the pussy." Hikaru smiled. "Let the Ice Queen have Tokyo, for now, in six months we will own Sapporo." He promised.</p><p>"Excellent Son-in-Law." Cologne cackled approvingly. "And you are correct, we will let Nabiki Tendo have Tokyo. For now."</p><p>Shampoo kept her face as emotionless as she could. It wasn't that she disagreed with Cologne or, for that matter, Hikaru. The world ran on money. Money bought food, shelter and protection. Protection in China was expensive. In a world of sheep the Amazon's were wolves. The predator does not consider the wellbeing of the prey. If the Japanese were willing to kill themselves with drugs and guns, that was their business. It just meant more money for home. No, that wasn't why Shampoo hid her emotions. 'Don't know why we need Hikaru.' She thought in disgust. 'We can do better without him.'</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It was early Friday afternoon. The limosine drove up the long driveway to the Kuno mansion. Noriko found herself almost pressing her face against the window. As the car pulled up to the long entry stairway Noriko spotted two figures waiting at the top. Even before the car had stopped the two figures had already reached the bottom. Noriko waited impatiently for the driver to open the door. She composed her features as she stepped out. 'This is going to be an interesting weekend.' She thought.<p>"Noriko." Kodachi said and embraced the other woman. "Thank you for coming.'</p><p>"It's my pleasure, Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied.</p><p>"Please call me Kodachi." Kodachi almost begged. "Friends call each other by name."</p><p>"K-kodachi." Noriko said hesitantly. She put a smile on her face. "So, what are we going to do this weekend?" She asked brightly. "Kodachi?"</p><p>"Anything you want." Kodachi promised.</p><p>Noriko turned to the other person. "Hey Yoshi." She greeted he Kuno retainer. "Good to see you."</p><p>"Good to see you too Ms. Mata." Yoshi replied. "Let me get your bags." Yoshi smiled as Kodachi looped her arm through Noriko's and led the woman up the stairs. 'I haven't seen My Lady this happy in months.' Yoshi mused as he followed. 'This should be a very interesting weekend."</p><p>"Anything I want?" Noriko questioned as they walked up the stairs. "That could be expensive." She half threatened.</p><p>Kodachi laughed. "Oh good." She said cheerfully.</p><p>Kodachi and Noriko walked along the, to Noriko now familiar, corridors of the Kuno mansion. They stopped in front of an equally familiar door. "I've begun to think of this as your room.' Kodachi said as she opened the door. She and Noriko entered the room followed by Yoshi.</p><p>"Have you M," Noriko stopped. "Have you Kodachi?" Kodachi nodded behind her veil. 'You know I think I know the first thing I want to do." Noriko said. She stood in front of Kodachi and raised her hands.</p><p>"Noriko, what?" Kodachi said as Noriko hands touched the top of her head. "My veil." She gasped. She made to stop Noriko.</p><p>"You don't need this with me Kodachi." Noriko said softly. She removed the veil. "You can be the Black Widow for them but not for me, okay?" She looked into Kodachi's eyes. After a long hesitation Kodachi nodded. Noriko tossed the veil on the bed. "You know what the second thing I want do is?" She pulled Kodachi over to the bed and made her sit down she sat down next to Kodachi. "Let's talk." She smiled.</p><p>Kodachi slowly returned the smile. "That sounds like fun." She said. "What do you want to talk about?" She looked up at the sound of someone clearing their throat. Yoshi stood at the door. "Yes?"</p><p>"Would you and Ms. Mata like some refreshments?" He asked politely. He caught Noriko's eye and gave her a wink. "Popcorn? If I remember correctly the few times you had friends over you insisted on popcorn."</p><p>"And champagne." Noriko said. "Popcorn and champagne." She said. "I've always wanted to eat popcorn with champagne."</p><p>"What other way is there?" Kodachi said archly. "Oh ho ho ho." She laughed quietly behind her hand. "I think this is going to be a fun weekend."</p><p>Yoshi bowed and walked out. 'Yes this is going to be a very interesting weekend.' He thought to himself. 'My Lady laughed.' A thoughtful look came to his face. 'I must inform Cook.' He made his way to the kitchen. "Yuki, Miss Kuno wants popcorn and champagne. She's with Miss Mata." He informed a woman. The woman nodded. Yoshi made his way to the back of the kitchen. Cook's domain.</p><p>Cook, his name as well as his profession, was a burly man in his mid fifties with his round face and ruddy complexion it was difficult to think of him as anything but a cook. That would be a mistake. Cook like all Kuno family retainers was a Ninja and in this case a senior Ninja. He looked up at Yoshi's approach. "Yes?"</p><p>"Miss Kuno laughed." Yoshi said."Really laughed."</p><p>"Did she?" Cook replied. He rubbed his chin. "Interesting."</p><p>"I thought so Cook." Yoshi replied. "They're having popcorn and champagne in the Blue suite." He continued. "She's good for her."</p><p>"So you keep telling me." Cook replied. "Are you sure you're not letting your own feelings toward Miss Mata get in the way?" He shook his head. "You're asking a lot."</p><p>"I know Cook but Miss Kuno let Miss Mata remove her veil." He nodded at the look on Cook's face. "Exactly."</p><p>"I'll make the arrangements." Cook replied.</p><p>"Thank you Cook." Yoshi replied.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Noriko giggled at a comment from Kodachi. The two women sat cross-legged on the bed eating popcorn and drinking, as Noriko always wanted, champagne. 'I've never seen Ms Kuno so alive.' She thought to herself. 'No wonder Ky fell in love with her.' She giggled again. "Did you really tie Ranma up with your ribbon?" She asked in amusement.<p>Kodachi nodded cheerfully. She leaned closer. "I even think he liked it." She said conspiratorally.</p><p>Noriko giggled. "Probably." She said. "I've had a couple clients like that."</p><p>Kodachi found her expression falling at the reminder of Noriko's original profession. 'I think I really am jealous Ky.' Kodachi thought. "Would you stop?" Kodachi asked. "Entertaining I mean."</p><p>"Well I pretty much have." Noriko replied easily. "Between running the club and the training I've been doing." She shrugged. "I'm lucky if I get laid once a month." Suddenly Noriko blushed. "Please excuse me." She said hurriedly.</p><p>Kodachi waved a hand. "It's not as if I haven't heard the girls say worse." She said. "Please don't apologize." Kodachi sighed. "At least you have someone."</p><p>"For now." Noriko grumped. "I think I'm going to lose one of them." She complained. "And he was a lot of fun too." Noriko looked curiously at Kodachi. "Why do you ask?"</p><p>Kodachi waved her hands helplessly. "I don't know." She began. She stopped. "No, that's not true." She looked at Noriko. "It bothers me." She said flatly. "You could do so much, be whatever you wanted." She said in a rush. "I, I." Kodachi broke off as a panicked look appeared on her face.</p><p>Noriko pulled Kodachi into an embrace. Kodachi resisted for a moment then. as if some door Kodachi had kept shut was allowed to open, she started to sob. "It's okay Kodachi." Noriko said soothingly. "I'll be whatever you want me to be." She said softly. "I'll do whatever you want me to do." Noriko stroked Kodachi's hair. "Ky would understand."</p><p>"I miss him so." Kodachi said brokenly into Noriko's shoulder. "He was a good man. A good man."</p><p>"Yes." Noriko replied. "But only after he met you." She said. "Oh Ky wasn't a bad man, but after he met you, that's when he became a really good man." Noriko fished a tissue from a pocket and wiped Kodachi's eyes. "That's why I follow you." She declared. "That's why we all follow you." She pushed Kodachi away so she could look into her eyes. "We were common whores until you showed up." Noriko smiled into Kodachi's eyes. "We're still whores but not common ones."</p><p>"You're not a whore." Kodachi said firmly, almost angrily.</p><p>"Yes I am Kodachi." Noriko disagreed. "I'm a whore, I'm a good whore." She said.</p><p>"But," Began Kodachi but she was stopped when Noriko put her hand over Kodachi's mouth.</p><p>"I'm a whore, Kodachi." Noriko said softly. "But I'm not just any whore. I'm Ms Kuno's number one girl." She said proudly. Noriko smiled broadly. "And that's as good as it gets."</p><p>"My number one girl?" Kodachi said in surprise. She wiped the remaining tears from her eyes with the back of her hand. "And you're happy with that?"</p><p>"More than you can imagine." Noriko said. "As good as Ky was he'd never have made me manager of the club." She said. "The best I could have hoped for was what I was or being" She shrugged. "His number one girl." She chuckled. "And you already were that."</p><p>Despite herself Kodachi giggled. "It has a different meaning when you say it." Kodachi wiped her eyes again.</p><p>Noriko giggled in response. "Well we did wonder." She admitted. "That was before we got to know you." She continued. "It didn't take us long to realize you were different. Ky became nicer to us because of you. I'm not saying he was bad to us." She added hurriedly. "It's just that we weren't individuals. Not really." She said. "Just someone to fuck and look good on his arm." She shrugged. "He was pretty generous though." A look of sadness came to her face. "Then Koko happened." She looked at Kodachi and the look was one of pure wonder. "You," She pointed a finger. "He did it for you."</p><p>"He did it for the Ice Queen." Kodachi said in disagreement.</p><p>Noriko shook her head. "No." She said firmly. "He did it for you." Noriko took Kodachi's hand between both of hers. "He did it for you Kodachi. He wanted you to be proud of him. He wanted to be worthy of you."</p><p>"I wanted to be worthy of him." Kodachi said in a near  time when the tears returned to Kodachi's eyes, tears from Noriko's joined them. The two woman leaned closer until their foreheads touched. They stayed like that for a long time before they separated. "We must look a sight." Kodachi coughed a laugh. "I haven't had a good cry in ages."</p><p>"Me neither." Noriko admitted. "Feel better?" She asked.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "Yes." She said. "Thank you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Cook put down the headphones he was holding to his ear. "Remarkable." He said quietly. He pulled out his cell phone and punched a number. "Lord Kuno?" He said. "It's Cook." He smiled. "She's well Lord Kuno, I'll be sure to let her know you asked of her." He nodded. "Yes My Lord, Ms. Mata is here." He said. "My Lord, about Ms Mata." Cook chewed his lip for a moment. "We think she will do." He nodded. "Tonight."<p>End Chapter 4</p><p>Author's notes: You know what I like best about my readers? They have such good ideas and I shamelessly admit stealing the best of them.</p>
