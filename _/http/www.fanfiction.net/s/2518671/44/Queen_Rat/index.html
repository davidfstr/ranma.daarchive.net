</div><p>Chapter 6</p><p>'Action at last'</p><p>Kodachi walked into Noriko's suite. "It's almost time." She said. "Yoshi will have the car waiting for us."</p><p>Noriko nodded. "I hate Mondays." She muttered. She examined Kodachi closely. Kodachi was wearing her usual elegantly tailored black. "You look good." Noriko decided. "But something is missing."</p><p>"Missing?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>Noriko nodded. She walked over to a table picked up something and returned to Kodachi. She raised her hands and, to Kodachi's astonishment, placed the veil she had removed her first day back on Kodachi's head. "Everyone will be expecting the Black Widow. We shouldn't disappoint them."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi entered the club with Noriko a step behind. As they walked toward the office they were greeted with polite bows from guests and employees alike. Kodachi entered her office and Noriko went to her station. Several people immediately ran up to Noriko. "Tea for Ms Kuno." She told one. "She has a busy schedule so make sure there is always fresh tea." The woman nodded and ran off. "Check the wine cellar." She told another. "There is going to be a bachelor party tonight." The woman nodded and ran off. Noriko looked up into the grinning face of Miki.<p>"So?" Miki asked. "How was the weekend?"</p><p>Noriko fought down her own grin and only let a calm smile appear on her face. "It was a very good weekend." Noriko said. "And that's all you're going to hear from me." She looked toward Kodachi's office. "It wouldn't do."</p><p>"Girl." Miki said with a sympathetic smile. "You got it bad." Miki leaned forward. "Good for you." She said. "And good for Ms Kuno." She placed a hand on Noriko's shoulder. "You take care of her, okay?"</p><p>"I will Miki." Noriko replied. "Thanks."</p><p>"No problem girlfriend." She said. "I'm jealous as hell you understand but you're the right girl for her." She squeezed Noriko's shoulder. "And I think I speak for everyone on that." She removed her hand. "Oh by the way, there are two girls who are here looking for work." She nodded toward a table near the back. "They came down from Sapporo."</p><p>"Sapporo?" Noriko asked. "They came down together?"</p><p>Miko shook her head. "That's the weird thing, they're both from Sapporo but they came down separately."</p><p>Noriko shrugged. "Weird." She agreed. "Well let me talk to them." She walked toward the table. Miki having nothing to do decided to tag along. "What are their names?" Noriko asked.</p><p>"Suki Uma and Amiko Nimura." Miki replied. "Suki is the redhead and Amiko is the blond." Miki elaborated.</p><p>Noriko nodded. They reached the table. "Miss Uma? Miss Nimura?" The two women nodded. Suki Uma was tall, willowy and her redhair reached almost to her knees. 'A definite plus.' Noriko thought critically. Amiko Nimura was short, round, almost plump, but carried herself well. Both were very attractive in their own ways. "I'm Noriko Mata, I'm the manager of this club." The two women got to their feet and bowed. Noriko waved them back down and joined them at the table. "Well you're both pretty enough." She commented.</p><p>"Thank you Miss Mata." Suki said.</p><p>"Ms Mata." Miki corrected idly. "Well, I have to get ready." She looked at Noriko. "Call me later, okay?" Noriko nodded and Miki walked off.</p><p>Noriko returned her attention to the two women. "So what brings the two of you down from Hokkaido?"</p><p>"I don't know about Amiko." Suki said. "But," She hesitated. "About a month ago I started hearing rumors about some new outfit moving in on the old families. Next thing I know my pimp was telling me I had to start selling drugs to my customers." She shook her head. "Uh uh. No way."</p><p>"You too? Me too." Amiko said in surprise. "Look I'm a whore not a dealer." Amiko continued. "I don't mind someone smoking a blunt now and then, but we're talking about hard stuff. Crack, meth, heroin." Suki started nodding as Amiko spoke. "Then this Chinese broad came around and started telling us that if we knew what was good for us we'd cut her in on a piece of the action. In exchange for," Amiko wiggled two fingers of each hand. "protection."</p><p>"Same here." Suki said in her own surprise. "That's exactly what happened to me too."</p><p>Noriko's eyes widened in shock. She stood. "Come with me please." She waited for the two women to stand then turned and headed directly to Kodachi's office. She knocked and stuck her head in. "Sorry to disturb you Ms Kuno, but I think you need to hear this." She entered the office and waved the two women in. "This is Suki and Amiko, they came looking for work." She turned to the two women. "This is Ms Kuno, please tell her what you just told me."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hokkaido." Nabiki mused. She walked to a wall that contained a map of Japan. "Good choice." She said in reluctant admiration. "He could hide a small fleet in any number of secluded harbors and hide an army in Daisetsu-zan National Park. Not to mention a ton of tourists for the sex and drugs trade." She walked back to her desk, "By the time the authorities take any legal action he'd be impossible to dislodge."<p>Kyoshi Nerumi, the senior member of Nabiki Tendo's organization nodded in agreement. "And until we know the extent of his resources." He broke off. "Hell he's probably already absorbed who knows how many of the small gangs that were there to begin with." He shook his head angrily. "And he won't stop with Hokkaido." He predicted.</p><p>"No." Agreed Kimi. "No he won't." She made some notations on her laptop. "I say we send someone to scope it out."</p><p>"I agree." Nabiki said. "Ladies? Gentlemen?" She asked. This time the 'Ladies' included Noriko Mata. Nabiki watched as Noriko whispered something in Kodachi's ear then returned to her own laptop.</p><p>Kodachi tapped her chin in thought."The obvious choice is Ranma's team." Kodachi said finally. "But I believe one of us should go as well." She smiled. "As ambassador, if you will."</p><p>"Two of us." Tokio Wasuhara said suddenly. "And I want to be one of them."</p><p>"While I agree with Ms Kuno's suggestion, I must remind you that it will be dangerous." Nabiki pointed out. "Once they know you've arrived Hikaru will come after whoever it is."</p><p>"So?" Tokio replied with a swagger in his voice. "My people are pretty good. They should be; they've been training with your father." She gave Kodachi a look that was a combination of admiration and leer. "And unless I miss my guess, the Black Widow was planning on going herself."</p><p>"Sister?" Tatewaki said in shock.</p><p>"Who else could go Brother?" Kodachi said reasonably.</p><p>"I forbid it." Tatewaki exclaimed loudly. He stopped when Nabiki placed a hand on Tatewaki's shoulder.</p><p>"You'll have to let her go lover." Nabiki said quietly yet firmly. She caught Tatewaki's eyes with her own and even he had to defer to the Ice Queen. "She's the best choice."</p><p>"I could go." Tatewaki declared.</p><p>"You are going Lover." Nabiki said in sad tones. "I need you and Captain Osigi to look for his fleet."</p><p>"There is that." Tatewaki said grudgingly. "And to assist or retrieve anyone in trouble." He nodded. The he looked directly at Noriko. "You don't leave her side." He ordered. "And you will take Yoshi and Yuki with you." He said to Kodachi.</p><p>"I hadn't planned." She stopped at a touch from Noriko. She turned and looked at the woman who helped fill the void in her soul. "Are you sure?" She asked quietly. Noriko nodded though it was obvious the girl had gone pale.</p><p>"T3 is our strongest team." Kyoshi pointed out. "We'll be vulnerable."</p><p>Nabiki smiled slightly. "But they're not our only team." She said. "We still have some significant muscle at our disposal. And it has been quiet recently." She looked at Tokio. "Tokio do you have someone you trust to run things in your absence?" She asked. "Or do you want one of us to do it?" She nodded her chin at Kyoshi. "If it were me, I'd have Kyoshi watch out for your interests."</p><p>"Why thank you Ice Queen." Kyoshi replied in pleased tones. "I am humbled by your trust."</p><p>Tokio laughed. "Sure, why not? Kyoshi you want the job? You can have the job." He turned to Nabiki. "I know a couple people there. Stand up guys. I'll talk to them first." Tokio sat back. 'I could end up owning a big piece of Hokkaido out of this.' Tokio smiled in anticipation.</p><p>Kodachi looked through her veil at Tokio. 'He's a pig but he's a smart pig.' Kodachi thought. 'I expect he's going to try carving a piece of Sapporo for himself.' She shrugged mentally. 'Let him, it's a small price to pay.' She leaned back slightly. "Noriko?" she said quietly.</p><p>"Yes Ms Kuno?" She replied in the same tone.</p><p>"Have Yoshi keep an eye on Tokio." She whispered. "I want to know who he sees and where he goes."</p><p>"Yes Ms Kuno." Noriko replied. She shot a glance at the Yakusa lord. 'Don't even think of touching her you pig.' She thought. 'I saw the way you looked at her. She is not for someone like you.' She returned her attention to her laptop and made a few notes.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Action at last." Chortled Ranma. He rubbed his hands together in anticipation. "It's been boring recently." He said. "I like Itabashi but there's no one here to give me a challenge." He grinned at Akane and Ukyo. "Besides you guys that is."<p>"Of course." Akane said in agreement. She cracked her knuckles. "I expect Shampoo is there as well." She said. "Probably added a trick or two since we last tangled." She admitted. "But so have I." She declared.</p><p>"Don't get over confident sugar." Ukyo said warningly. "Don't play with her, take her down and take her down fast."</p><p>"Worried Uk-chan?" Akane grinned. "Come on; what's the worst that could happen?"</p><p>"You could be dead." Ukyo replied seriously..</p><p>Akane mimed a yawn. "Been there. Done that." Akane said. "Trust me Uk-chan it's overrated." Akane walked over to Ukyo and placed a hand on her shoulder. "Don't worry Uk-chan, I'll take her seriously." She grinned. "But you gotta admit it has been boring."</p><p>Ukyo snorted. "You have a point." She said. "Okay, I'll lighten up." She promised. "So how do you want to handle this?"</p><p>"I've always wanted to go to Sapporo. Especially the Susukino." Ranma declared. "Night clubs out the wazoo." He said. "I think it's time for U.S.A. to take the show on the road.."</p><p>"Alright." Akane cheered. She waved a finger at Ranma. "But we are going to hit at least one hot spring." She demanded. "And my family will kill me if I don't bring back some chocolate."</p><p>Ranma raised his hands in surrender. "No argument from me Tomboy." He said cheerfully. "Why go to Sapporo if we don't?" Ranma chuckled. "Don't worry Tomboy we'll hit a spa or two."</p><p>"Good." Akane said firmly. She rubbed her chin. "Nakamura probably knows we're U.S.A." Akane said almost to herself. She grinned. "Yeah, there's no way he'll ignore us." She nodded. "All we have to do is dance and wait for him." She nodded again. "It works."</p><p>"Not to mention we'll make a few yen while we're at it." Ranma said with his own grin. "I figure we hit the main strip clubs in the Susukino. Make some connections. You know the usual." He looked at the nodding Akane and Ukyo. "Let's find out how much he's accomplished so far."</p><p>"If the old ghoul's involved, he'll have a good chunk by now." Akane muttered. She looked up as the doorbell rang. "That must be Chikato." She said. Akane strode to the front door and opened it. "Hey Captain." Akane greeted the heavyset Captain Noriudo. "Come on in." She waved the policeman into the apartment.</p><p>"Hey Akane. Guys." Chikato greeted the martial artists.</p><p>"Beer?" Ranma asked. Chikato nodded. Ranma went over to a small refrigerator and opened it. A row of beer bottles lay on a shelf. He snorted. "Sapporo, heh. You guys gonna share as usual?" He asked. Akane and Ukyo made a sound of acknowledgement. Ranma pulled out several bottles. He tossed one to Akane, kicked the refrigerator door closed and twisted off the two remaining bottle caps with his fingers. He handed one bottle to the police captain. Ranma sat down on the couch next to Chikato. "So what can you tell us?"</p><p>Chikato took a slug of his beer before answering. "About what Nabs predicted. He's taken over enough gangs and their territories for the bigger families to begin to take notice." Chikato made a motion like he was toasting someone. "Nabiki just told me one of the Yakuza lords in Sapporo contacted her today." He said. "A social call he called it. From one Oyabun to another." Chikato leaned forward. "His name is Kinnikun Honda and he heads one of the older families in Sapporo. Very old school." He said. "He's agreed to meet with Kodachi and Tokio." Chikato grimaced. "Nabiki is going to end up running Sapporo isn't she?"</p><p>Akane snickered. "Probably." She said cheerfully. "Oh, don't worry so much; just be glad it's Nabs."</p><p>Chikato blew out a breath and nodded. "Trust me, I am." He said moodily. He chugged his beer before continuing. "I can't run interference for you or Nabiki in Sapporo." He said in the same moody tones. "Not directly anyway." He explained. "I have a couple of friends in the Sapporo department but the amount of information I can get from them is limited. Not without having to explain about you three." He shook a finger. "That means you're on your own."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Good evening and welcome to the Gold Club; Sapporo's premier club for adult entertainment." The MC said into the mike. "We have a special treat tonight." He said. "And judging by the size of the crowd tonight word has gotten out." A thumping beat came over the speakers. "Direct from Tokyo. Every man's wet dream. The Baddest Bad Girls in Japan. Usagi." Out through the curtain back flipped a red head in red halter and shorts. "Sugoi." A brown haired beauty in silver white bounced through the curtain. "And everybody's sweetheart, Aoi." An athletic girl in blue skipped to center stage.<p>"Hello boys." Akane said in her baby Aoi voice. "Are you ready to have some fun tonight?" There was a smattering of shouts of approval. Akane cupped an ear with one hand. "I can't hear you." She said. "Are you ready to have some fun tonight?" She asked again.</p><p>"Yes." Roared the crowd.</p><p>"That's better." Akane said. "I was starting to think you weren't happy to see me." She put a pout on her lips. Akane paced to the edge of the stage. "Hey stud." She called to one patron at the bar. "Are you happy to see little Aoi?" The man nodded rapidly.</p><p>Ranma and Ukyo walked up to stand on either side of Akane. "Hey he's cute." Ranma said.</p><p>"Hands off Usagi." Akane wagged a finger. "I saw him first."</p><p>"Awww." Ranma complained. She sighed. "Oh woe. It's Saturday night and I'm all alone." She said melodramatically. "Isn't there anyone who wants to take me home?" The shout that erupted from the crowd caused the windows to rattle.</p><p>"Hey leave one or two for me." Ukyo stepped up front.</p><p>"One or two?" Akane asked sweetly. "That's all? Since when?" She said to laughter.</p><p>"Well I heard Sapporo men are the best.' Ukyo raised her hands and pulled them apart. "And the biggest." She smiled at the howls of agreement from the crowd. 'We haven't even started stripping and we have them eating out of our hands.' She thought smugly. She, Ranma and Akane were now in position to start their routine. "Let's do it guys." Ukyo said.</p><p>Ranma stepped forward. "Usagi."</p><p>Ukyo raised her arms. "Sugoi."</p><p>Akane struck a cute pose with her finger on her chin. "Aoi."</p><p>"We're U.S.A." The three said in unison. For the next half hour the crowd at the Gold Club was given ample demonstration of why U.S.A. were the hottest strippers on the circuit. By the time they were down to their tiny bikini bottoms the stage was completely covered with bills of different denomination yen and the crowd was waving even more. In fact the crowd was so wild the manager started to worry that there was going to be a riot.</p><p>The manager of the club, Gengi Chiba, mopped his forehead. "My word." He said as the three strippers gathered all the money on the stage. "I think I'm going to need another bouncer." He said in awe. "I've never seen anything like that."</p><p>"No kidding." Said the bartender. He gave a low whistle. "You have got to get them to move here." He said seriously. "Look out there." He pointed with his chin. "I've never seen it this crowded." He started setting up glasses as a number of waitresses started rushing toward him. "Hell with the bouncer, get another bartender."</p><p>The waitresses came giggling to the bar. "Did you see that move?" One girl said the the other.</p><p>"Which one?" The other said. "The one where the three of them made the human pretzel?" She shook her head. "Or the one where the Usagi squrimed all over Aoi and Sugoi like a snake?"</p><p>"Yeah, that one. Hot." The waitress replied. "Better get another case of beer Beni." She said to the bartender. "Everyone, and I do mean everyone, is staying for the next set." She turned to the manager. "And you better get the girls out there pronto Gengi or they'll be a riot."</p><p>Gengi Chiba smiled. "Really?" He said. "I wonder if they'll consider extending their engagement?" He rubbed his hands together in avarice. "Maybe I can convince them to move here." His smile broadened as the subject of conversation exited from the dressing room. He applauded. "Girls, that was great." He enthused.</p><p>"Thank you Mr. Chiba." Ranma, Akane and Ukyo chorused cutely. They giggled. "Do you mind if we go and," Akane paused. "Greet our fans?"</p><p>The manager laughed. "You'd better or, as I've been told, there's gonna be a riot." He waved his hands. "Go." He watched the trio move into the main part of the club. A roar went up as they were noticed and the chant of U.S.A. arose.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo in matching tank tops and tight booty shorts in their trademark Red, Blue and Silver-white, strode through the mob of men like three hungry lionesses in the middle of a herd of antelope. Only instead of running away the men clustered closer. "You're gonna be a total slut aren't you Usagi?" Akane accused with a chuckle.</p><p>Ranma nodded her head rapidly. "Yep." She said cheerfully. "And I think I see my first victim." Ranma walked, no slinked, over to one man seated in a large cushioned chair. "Think you can handle it stud?" She asked.</p><p>"Two to one he doesn''t last thirty seconds." Ukyo whispered out of the side of her mouth as she watched Ranma straddle the man's lap.</p><p>"You're on." Akane replied cheerfully. Akane rolled her eyes as Ranma wiggled on the man's lap like the redhead was riding a bucking horse. "Twenty, twenty-one." Akane counted under her breath. At twenty-six the man eyes seemed to roll into the back of his head as he shuddered under the wiggling Ranma. "Damn, I thought he'd make it." Akane grinned. "My turn." She walked over to a man who just took a seat in a similar chair. The man held a wad of middle denomination yen. A minute later Akane was squirming her entire body against the patron. The wad of bills tucked securely in Akane's bra.</p><p>Ukyo laughed to herself as a third man waved a stack of bills at Ukyo. "My turn." She announced as she walked over to the man. 'Get ready for the ride of your life sugar."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Now remember Kiko." Kodachi said. "I expect you to work hard while Ms Mata and I are gone." She smiled at the grumpy look on the little girl's face. "Promise?" She asked.<p>"Yes Auntie." Kiko replied in resigned tones.</p><p>Kodachi reached into her bag and pulled out a cell phone. "Now this is for you." She handed the telephone to Kiko. "You can call me before you go to bed or if something important comes up." Kiko nodded. Kodachi turned to Koko. "The car will come every morning to pick Kiko up for class, and then take her to the Tendo's for training. I've left Mrs. Saotome in charge of the club in our absence but I'm relying on you to help her."</p><p>"Of course Ms Kuno." Koko replied. She smiled. "It will be nice to see the girls again."</p><p>"They'll be happy to see you too." Noriko said from doorway. "The car is waiting." She said to Kodachi.</p><p>"Thank you Noriko." Kodachi replied. She knelt down. "Now give your Auntie Kodachi a hug." Kodachi smiled when the little girl gave her a fierce hug. "Heavens. It's not like I'm not coming back." She said with a smile. She hugged the little girl back before she stood. "We can go now." Kodachi turned and walked over to Noriko. She gave Kiko one last glance before they walked away.</p><p>"You know what I'd do?" Noriko said in an aside. "I'd call her from the airport."</p><p>"I planned to." Kodachi replied with a quiet laugh. Kodachi reached over and squeezed Noriko's hand for a moment then let go.</p><p>They walked out of the mansion and down the steps. A car waited at the bottom. Standing almost at attention were Yuki and Yoshi. Yoshi was wearing black slacks and a black pullover.</p><p>Yuki was dressed in a light blue knee length skirt with matching blouse. This was the first time Noriko had seen the woman in anything other than a servant's uniform. Noriko was impressed. "You should dress like that more often." She said to the woman. "It suits you."</p><p>"Thank you Ms Mata." Yuki replied. She opened the rear door of the car. "Please." She waved Noriko and Kodachi into the car. With Yuki in the middle, she and Yoshi entered the front of the car. Yuki checked to make sure Kodachi and Noriko were settled before she told the driver to drive off.</p><p>It was a relatively short drive to the airport and the driver let them off at the terminal. Yoshi took charge of the bags while Yuki accompanied Kodachi and Noriko from a discrete distance behind. Yuki watched in pleased satisfaction as Kodachi made a call to her young ward. 'Between Noriko and Kiko, Miss Kuno is nearly her old self.' She thought to herself. 'Better than her old self.' She corrected herself.</p><p>Being Kodachi Kuno had its' privileges and the one Noriko was now appreciating was that Kodachi Kuno never stood in lines. They bypassed all the tiresome security checks and reservation confirmation and Noriko found herself, along with Kodachi and Yuki, in a private lounge. Noriko and Kodachi both accepted cocktails while Yuki refused the offer. Noriko observed the woman. 'Ninja.' She thought. One of the first things Noriko learned after she had moved into the mansion was that all Kuno retainers were trained in the martial arts. 'That includes me.' She realized in sudden surprise.</p><p>Yuki turned her head as if she realized she was being watched and looked directly at Noriko. Then she bobbed her head in a gesture that seemed to convey an understanding of a common cause but in a way that seemed to also say that she knew Noriko would do her best for that common cause. Noriko bobbed her head back and she turned her attention back to Kodachi.</p><p>Kodachi was sitting quietly on the couch with a pensive look on her face. "I wish I could have brought her." Kodachi said quietly.</p><p>"Too dangerous and you know it." Noriko said. She leaned over and put her arm across Kodachi's shoulders. "It's only three days. Four at most." Kodachi nodded. "But if I were you; I'd bring back plenty of chocolate." Noriko continued. Noriko smiled at Kodachi's snort of amusement. "That's better." She said in approval. "You were getting all moody again." She leaned closer. "What you need is a good massage." She whispered. "Complete with a happy ending."</p><p>"Imp." Kodachi giggled. She smiled at Noriko. "I'd like that." Kodachi leaned into Noriko and sighed happily when Noriko wrapped both her arms around her. Kodachi let Noriko hold her until Yoshi returned to announce that their flight was ready.</p><p>Noriko learned another thing about being Kodachi Kuno. "You own a jet?" She said in disbelief as they walked through the gangway.</p><p>"It's not a very big jet." Kodachi protested cheerfully. "And the Kunos own it, not I personally."</p><p>"You own a jet." Noriko grinned. "Kewl." She chirped.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka and Koko Kobiashi walked into the club. Nodoka wore her usual, though this time a not too formal, kimono, while Koko wore a light blue skirt and blouse combination. It was going to be a long evening and both women wanted to dress as comfortably as they could get away with. They were immediately approached by two familiar women. Koko was greeted enthusiatically first then they turned to Nodoka. "Good evening Mrs. Saotome." They chorused.<p>Nodoka smiled in greeting. "Miki. Aoi. It's so good to see you again." Nodoka said.</p><p>"It's good to see you too Mrs. Saotome." Aoi replied. She stopped at Nodoka's wagging finger. "Mrs. Saotome?"</p><p>"No. No. No." Nodoka said in disapproval. "I told you before; you must call me Auntie Nodoka." She said. "Mrs Saotome is way too formal." She smiled. "Now give Auntie Nodoka a hug." She said. Nodoka smiled widely as the two women embraced her simultaneously. "That's better." Nodoka linked her arm through the two women's arms. "I assume Noriko or Kodachi asked you to help us." She said. "And I for one am very pleased it's the two of you."</p><p>"Thank you Auntie. Noriko hoped you'd say that." Miki said. Aoi nodded in pleased agreement. "Sometimes you'll just need to sign off on credit lines or an invoice but mostly what Noriko did was made sure everything was running smoothly." Miki explained. "Abe will handle any drunks." She smiled wryly. "Abe is very good at it."</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka said in approval. "And once Genma comes off work he will sure to come here and help out." Nodoka rolled her eyes. "If only to get some free beer." She stopped suddenly. "And that's the only thing he gets, free or otherwise." She said firmly. "Is that understood?" She frowned. "I wouldn't put it past the old reprobate." She grumbled. "I swear the man must have been raised by wolves."</p><p>Miki and Aoi giggled. "I'll let the girls know." Miki promised.</p><p>"You do that dear." Nodoka replied. They stopped at a door. "Kodachi's office?" She eyed the door. She turned to Koko. "Let's get settled first then go walk around and say hello to everyone."</p><p>"Sounds good to me." Koko replied. She followied Nodoka into Kodachi's office. Curious, Koko looked around. Even with the light on, the room felt dark and sombre. The only bright spot was a single red rose in a vase on a small table. Koko walked over. At the base of the vase , under a pane of glass, was a card. Koko bent down. "It's a wedding invitation."</p><p>"I know." Nodoka said quietly. "I helped her write it." Nodoka placed her handbag on the desk. "Why don't we walk around."</p><p>Nodoka and Koko walked around the club. Those that knew Koko of course greeted her immediately. Nodoka knew most of the girls and was pleased by the enthusiastic greetings she did get. "Hello young woman." Nodoka greeted one of the waitresses. "I don't believe we were introduced but you seem familiar."</p><p>The waitress, a pretty brunette, smiled widely. "I should." She said. "I'm Fumie." She giggled. "Miss Nodoka."</p><p>Nodoka's eyes widened in remembrance."I suppose I have you to thank for my not making a complete fool of myself." Nodoka said.</p><p>Fumie giggled and shook her head. "Nope that was Ms Mata." She said. "Me I would have let you had some more fun."</p><p>"Oh they weren't serious." Nodoka said in dismissal. "It was just two young men being kind to an older woman."</p><p>"Oh I don't know about that." Fumie replied "Every time they come here they ask when 'Miss Nodoka' was coming back."</p><p>"Fumie!" Nodoka scolded. "Stop teasing." Then Nodoka's expression changed and she giggled. "You don't know how close I was to," She blushed. "Well it certainly was a memorable evening." Nodoka fanned herself. She and Fumie shared a giggle and Nodoka continued her walk around the club.</p><p>As Miki had promised the most frequent request was to approve a line of credit but mostly Nodoka's main job seemed to be more of den mother than manager. 'I know this can't be all Noriko does.'</p><p>Nodoka walked back to Noriko's station and sat down. Koko was off somewhere, catching up with a friend of two, Nodoka assumed. No sooner had she sat then a waitress brought over some tea. She looked around. Waitresses plied the tables. Croupiers ran the games. The bartender controlled the bar. And the working girls seemed to be in all three places. 'Four if you count the rooms upstairs.' Nodoka started to nod slowly. 'Everyone knows what they should be doing.' She realized. 'Well done Noriko, well done.'</p><p>The evening continued to pass uneventfully. Any 'business' that required Kodachi's attention was probably being handled by Kodachi while in Sapporo. Anything more immediate could, at worst, be given to Nabiki to deal with. 'No, I'm just the den mother.' Nodoka admitted to herself.</p><p>"Miss Nodoka!" Came a enthusiastic chorus from two tenor voices. Nodoka looked up. "Oh dear." She thought in a combination of dismay and, to her chagrin, anticipation. She put a smile on her face. "Hello boys."</p><p>"See I told you she'd be back." One young man said to the other. The other young man nodded. "We missed you Miss Nodoka." He said. He gave Nodoka a sad look. "Didn't you like us?"</p><p>"Well of course I liked you." Nodoka protested. "It's just that." Nodoka stopped. "Oh dear, this is embarrassing." She said. "Do you have a table?" She asked. 'Someplace far away.' She thought.</p><p>"We just got here." The first young man said.</p><p>"Let me see," Nodoka began. She stopped as Fumie hurried over. "Oh Fumie." Nodoka blushed. "Could you find a table for," She turned. "Oh dear, I don't know your names."</p><p>"I'm Jiro." The first young man said. "That's Daisuke." He said. "Will you be joining us Miss Nodoka?"</p><p>"Well I'm very busy." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Please." Chorused Jiro and Daisuke.</p><p>"Oh go ahead Miss Nodoka." Fumie said cheerfully. "It's a quiet night."</p><p>"But." Nodoka protested.</p><p>"Now you know the Black Widow would want you to have a little fun while you watch things for her." Fumie said.</p><p>"You know the Black Widow?" Daisuke breathed. "Wow."</p><p>"Miss Nodoka is the only person the Black Widow would trust to watch things in her absence." Fumie said in serious tones.</p><p>"But." Nodoka attempted to protest again.</p><p>"I'll have the Black Widow's private table prepared right away." Fumie smiled at Nodoka and raced away.</p><p>"But." Nodoka said to Fumie's retreating back. Swallowing, she turned back to the two young men. They were looking at her with expressions that bordered on hero worship. "She's just a friend of my son's." Nodoka said. "He's about your age." She smiled apologetically. 'There that should make them realize their mistake.' Nodoka thought in regretful relief. "I'm sure I could find someone more your age to keep you company."</p><p>The two men's faces fell. "I thought you said you liked us." Daisuke said mournfully.</p><p>"Well I do." Nodoka said in exasperation. "But I'm so much, I mean, I'm too, I mean, I'm sure I'm older than the girls you usually meet."</p><p>"They're so boring." Daisuke said in near contempt. "All they talk about is clothes or some singer or something."</p><p>"Boring." Jiro chimed in. "And none of them were as pretty as you."</p><p>Daisuke nodded in vigorous agreement. "Or as sophisticated." Daisuke added.</p><p>"Or as elegant." Jiro said. "Or as everything."</p><p>"Your table is ready Miss Nodoka." Fumie's voice broke in. "And I took the liberty of bringing a bottle of Sake from the Black Widow's private stock." She looked at the two men. "Nothing but the best for Miss Nodoka." The look she gave Jiro and Daisuke was measuring. "You just might do." They blushed in unison.</p><p>Nodoka looked at the two young men again. "You really would like me to join you?" She asked them. They nodded vigorously. "Well maybe I could take a little break."</p><p>Jiro and Daisuke looked at each other. "Yes!" They pumped their fists.</p><p>In minutes Nodoka found herself, along with her two admirers, at Kodachi's private table. It was situated in a small alcove near a wall, close to both her office and the stage. It's location and the depth of the alcove gave a measure of privacy to anyone at the table. What Nodoka had not anticipated was that instead of chairs a wide curved bench ran along the back of the table. "The Black Widow likes to watch the shows sometimes." Fumie said. "But she doesn't like to be disturbed."</p><p>"People could see her if they walked by." Daisuke pointed out. He and Jiro had seated themselves on either side of Nodoka. "It's not that private." He said in a slight tone of complaint.</p><p>"Well complete privacy is impossible in this part of the club. For that you'll have to go upstairs." Fumie admitted. She suppressed a grin as the two men looked at Nodoka hopefully. "However," She walked over to the arch of the alcove and undid a sash. A semi-transparent black curtain closed off the back half of the alcove with Fumie, now only a shadow, on the outside. "If you don't turn on the light over the table, no one can see in." Fumies voice came from the outside. She stuck her head through the curtain. "Now if you need anything. The call button is under the table." She pulled her head out and walked away, leaving the curtain in place.</p><p>Nodoka looked to her left and then to her right. She looked straight ahead. She looked down. Saw her sake cup. It was full. She picked it up and downed the hot sake in one gulp. She put the cup down on the table. Nodoka looked left. She looked right. Nodoka looked straight ahead and licked her lips. She felt two hands each take possesion of a knee. "Oh my."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Genma nodded at Abe as he approached. "Evening Abe." Genma greeted. "All quiet?"<p>"Evening Mr Saotome." Abe replied. "All quiet." He confirmed. He opened the door and let Genma in. As Genma passed, Abe pressed a button next to the door.</p><p>Genma entered the club and started to look for Nodoka. Before he took more than a step or two a waitress hurried over. "Mr. Saotome." She greeted cheerfully. "Your wife told us to look out for you."</p><p>"Speaking of my wife." Genma replied. "Where is she?"</p><p>"Oh she's around somewhere." The waitress said vaguely. "In the meantime, we have a table reserved for you near the dance floor." The waitress said quickly. "Why don't you have a beer while you wait for her?" She took Genma's arm and pulled him along. "Hi Genma." Several girls sang in greeting as Genma was led to his table. They waved their fingers and giggled cutely. "I can go find her for you." The waitress said as Genma sat. Two of the girls that greeted Genma walked toward the table.</p><p>"Oh don't bother her if you don't have to." Genma said hurriedly. "I'm sure she's busy."</p><p>The waitress turned her head and looked off to a corner before returning her attention to Genma. "Very busy, I think at this moment." She said. "Why she may be occupied for at least another hour or two." She added. "Let me get you that beer." Fumie and the two girls who approached the table winked at each other.</p><p>Fumie walked over to where Koko was now sitting at the Noriko's station. "Okay they're both occupied." Fumie reported.</p><p>"Good but remember only the beer is free." Koko giggled. "At least for Mr Saotome."</p><p>"Oh the girls know that but I think , no I know, one or two wouldn't care as long as Auntie is having a good time." Fumie replied. She looked toward Kodachi's private booth and covered her mouth as she giggled.</p><p>"Amazing coincidence that they showed tonight." Koko said in a slightly accusing tone.</p><p>"Yeah, isn't it?" Fumie said cheerfully. "Well I'd better go." She said and hurried away.</p><p>Nodoka didn't know if it was the sake or the attention of the two young men that was affecting her judgement. Both were intoxicating. "I need another drink." She declared. She giggled as the two young men both reached for the sake bottle simultaneously. Jiro reached the bottle first and refilled Nodoka's cup. Nodoka reached forward for the cup and squeaked in surprise as Daisuke took the opportunity to get his hand underneath Nodoka's kimono. Nodoka gasped as Daisuke's warm hand caressed Nodoka's bare thigh. Nodoka gasped again when Jiro also capitalized on Nodoka's distraction to start caressing her breasts through the material of the kimono. Nodoka turned her head toward Jiro to, weakly, protest when the young man captured her mouth with his own. A moan escaped from Nodoka's mouth.</p><p>Fumie listened to the faint moans coming from the curtained booth. A self-satisfied smile came to her lips. "Have fun Auntie." She said quietly. Fumie took it upon herself to make sure no one came too close to the booth while the other waitresses took up the slack. What was happening in the booth was, by now, common knowledge among the working girls. All of them, without exception, approved. 'Why should the guys have all the fun?' They all thought in one way or another. But most of all they liked Nodoka. 'Auntie' as she insisted they call her.</p><p>They even liked Genma. Not as much as 'Auntie' Nodoka but they thought he was alright for a man. No worse than most and surprisingly better than many. In their world he was just a regular guy. Besides Genma was, Fumie giggled at the sudden shrieks from the floor as a giant panda was suddenly rolling on his back under a dogpile of the working girls, cuddly.</p><p>Author's Notes: Thought I'd let the old girl have some fun.</p>
