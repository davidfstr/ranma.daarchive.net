</div><p>'Fallen Angels - First Blood'</p><p>The limo stopped in front of the Kuno mansion and the driver got out and opened the passenger door. A giggling group of women exited and clustered in a group as their luggage was removed from the trunk. There were six in all; Aoi and her cousin Ami, Miki, Makoto, Rei and Fumie. Makoto and Rei stopped giggling and stared open mouthed at the mansion. "Look at this place." Rei said in awe to Makoto. "It's huge."</p><p>"Wait till you see the inside." Miki said. She rubbed her hands together in anticipation. "I've been here exactly twice before." She grinned. "We are going to be so spoiled."</p><p>"Do you have any idea why Ms. Kuno invited us?" Makoto asked. "Not that I'm complaining you understand." She gazed at the mansion in awe. "It's just." She trailed off with a blush.</p><p>"Had to break a date with Genji?" Miki guessed. Makoto nodded. "I'm sure he'll understand."</p><p>"Oh he does." Makoto admitted. "When I told him Ms. Kuno invited me for the weekend he just told me to have fun." Makoto looked down at her shoes. "It's just that I was looking forward to seeing him." She said plaintively. The laughter that rose up around her was sympathetic.</p><p>'I just hope Genji is as attached to Makoto as Makoto is to him.' Miki thought. It was a thought that came more frequently to Miki as the weeks had progressed into months. The one thing she worried about was that one day Genji would get tired of Makoto, or more likely, find someone new. Makoto's two other regulars, while they hadn't dropped Makoto, had already had a different girl or two. 'On the other hand.' Miki mused. 'They all still prefer Makoto when they want to impress a client or when their egos needed stroking.' Miki suppressed a giggle. 'And, from what I hear, Makoto is certainly good at stroking.' She took Makoto's hand. "Don't worry kid, he'll be there next weekend." She said encouragingly. "Now, no more moping. Let's enjoy the weekend."</p><p>A number of liveried retainers hurried down the long front entrance stairway and started collecting the luggage. One woman remained behind. "Good afternoon ladies." She said. "My name is Yuki. Ms Mata asked me to look after you."</p><p>"So you're Yuki." Miki said. "Noriko speaks very highly of you." She said. "I'm Miki."</p><p>"Ah yes." Yuki said in recognition. "Ms. Mata has mentioned you as well." She bowed politely.</p><p>Miki smiled. "May I present Makoto, Rei, Fumie, Aoi and Ami." Miki introduced the rest of the 'girls'.</p><p>"A pleasure." Yuki replied. "If you will follow me." Yuki led the women into the mansion. "Ms. Kuno has given you two adjoining suites." Yuki said as the walked. "They share a common room." She stopped at a door and waved all six into the  suppressed a smile at the oohs and ahhs that came from the six women. "This is the common room." She said. Yuki walked over to a door and opened it. She indicated Makoto, Rei and Miki. "Ms. Mata thought you three would prefer taking this room." She walked over to a second door. "And you three would have this room." She said to Ami, Aoi and Fumie. "Dinner will be at eight." Yuki said. "If you need anything please don't hesitate to ask." She pointed to a plate on the wall. "Press the right hand button and ask for me."</p><p>"Thank you Yuki." Miki said. Her thanks were echoed by the rest of the girls. Yuki bowed herself out of the suite. Miki looked around. "Well everyone let's get settled and then meet back here." Miki went to the connecting door and opened it and she, Makoto and Rei went into their suite.</p><p>"This place is huge." Rei said in awe. "And beautiful." Makoto and Miki nodded in agreement. The room held three futons already laid out and their luggage was at the foot of each futon. "Hey what's this?" On each futon was a garment bag and two small boxes. Rei picked up the bag that she, because her luggage was at the foot of the futon it was on, assumed it was for her. Rei opened the bag and gasped. "It's a evening dress." She said. "It's beautiful."</p><p>"Hey I got one too." Makoto said. She opened a box. "And shoes."</p><p>"And a matching purse." Miki added. "And a note." She waved an envelope then opened it. "A small token of our appreciation." She read. "It's signed by Ms. Kuno and Noriko." She informed the other two women. She laughed happily. "Small token." She said in amusement. "Even with the money I'm making these days, I don't think I could afford this." Miki placed the garment bag carefully back on the futon. "Well I guess I know what we're wearing to dinner." Miki said.</p><p>After unpacking and examining the rest of the suite the three woman made their way back to the common room where they found Ami, Aoi and Fumie sitting around and talking excitedly. "Have some champagne." Ami said cheerfully as they entered. "It was here waiting for us."</p><p>"And it's pretty good too." Fumie added.</p><p>"Raven will be the judge of that." Miki laughed good naturedly. The rest of the girls giggled, including Rei. "Was there a gift waiting for you guys as well?" Miki asked. There were nods from the other women. "Oh good." She looked at her watch. "We've got a lot of time to kill before dinner, what should we do?"</p><p>"Look around the mansion?" Fumie suggested. "I wonder if they give tours." She mused. Any further suggestions were interrupted by a knocking on the common room door. The door opened and Kodachi and Noriko walked in. The six women scrambled to their feet.</p><p>"Good afternoon ladies." Kodachi said pleasantly.</p><p>"Good afternoon, Ms. Kuno." They chorused in return."Good Afternoon Ms. Mata."</p><p>"I hope everyone is settled in?" Kodachi asked. She smiled at the nods. "I want to thank you all for coming."</p><p>"Thank you for inviting us, Ms. Kuno." Miki replied for everyone. Miki chewed her lip. "Pardon me for asking Ms. Kuno, not that any of us are complaining, but," She waved a hand to indicate the room and by implication their very presence in the mansion.</p><p>"Because the six of you are, each in your own way, my best girls." Kodachi replied. "And Noriko and I wanted to show our appreciation." Kodachi smiled at the sudden exclamations of surprise and equally sudden looks of pride that appeared on the women's faces. Kodachi walked along the line of women like a general reviewing her troops. "Ami and Aoi here, for example, seem to have a knack for getting our clients to, shall we say, open up."</p><p>"Those stock tips you provided were very profitable." Noriko added. "The Ice Queen was very pleased." Ami and Aoi looked at each other and grinned.</p><p>"And you Fumie." Kodachi smiled. "Don't think I don't know about how well you've watched out for Auntie." Kodachi said knowingly. "Your devotion to her is most commendable."</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." Fumie said quietly.</p><p>Kodachi stopped in front of Makoto and Rei. "And I think everyone would agree that the two of you have made some wonderful contributions to our little family." Finally Kodachi came to Miki. "And you Miki, the girl all the other girls go to first with their problems." Kodachi placed a companionable hand on Miki's shoulder. "Everybody's big sister." Mki blushed at the murmurs of agreement from the other girls. "Thank you." Kodachi removed her hand. "Yes, you are my best girls." She declared.</p><p>The six women exchanged pleased and happy glances with each other, then nearly as one they bowed to Kodachi. The bow Kodachi returned was deeper and more respectful than they expected and left them slightly flustered. "Now." Said Kodachi briskly. "Is there anything you'd all like to do before dinner?" She asked.</p><p>Miki looked around to the faces of the other girls. 'Guess I'm the spokesgirl.' She thought. "Well if you wouldn't mind." Miki said hesitantly. "We'd really like to see more of the mansion."</p><p>"Oh ho ho." Laughed Kodachi. "Would you really?" She asked in true curiousity. "Then let's." She said at the nods. Kodachi stood. "Where would you like to start?" She asked.</p><p>"I think the gardens would be best." The uptill now silent yet smiling Noriko said. "You better introduce them to Midorigami before someone decides to take a dip." She rolled her eyes at the assembled women. "Don't worry he's harmless really."</p><p>"Who's harmless?" Asked Miki. "What's a Midorigami?" She swallowed nervously at the twin, evil grins that appeared on both Noriko and Kodachi's faces.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi watched in satisfaction as her 'girls' chattered and giggled happily during dinner. 'They work so hard, give so much.' She thought. 'And it takes so little to make them happy.' Kodachi mused sadly. 'A kind word, just a kind word, will make them smile.' She raised her wine glass to hide the expression on her face.<p>Noriko leaned over. "I keep remembering the looks on their faces when you introduced them to Midorigami." Noriko smiled at Kodachi's sudden giggle. 'Good.' She thought. 'You were looking sad again.' Noriko took a sip of her own wine. 'I think inviting the girls over was a good idea.' Noriko thought. 'For Kodachi and the girls.' Noriko put her glass down. "When was the last time we had a girls night out?" Noriko said in a louder voice. "I think we should be the one's who are entertained for once, don't you?"</p><p>"Tonight?" Kodachi asked in reply. Noriko nodded. Kodachi leaned forward and tapped a water glass with a fork. "Girls. Girls." Kodachi waited until she had the attention of all the women at the table. "Noriko has suggested a girls night out and," She stopped at the shrieks of glee from the assembled women. "I guess that means they like the idea." Kodachi said in amusement. She raised a hand and Yuki, who had been standing off to the side, hurried over. "Yuki we'll be needing the stretch limo."</p><p>"Yes My Lady." Yuki replied.</p><p>"And wear something slinky." Noriko added.</p><p>"Miss Mata?" Yuki asked in comfusion.</p><p>"You are going with us, aren't you?" Noriko replied. "For our protection."</p><p>"Well yes but," Began Yuki.</p><p>"Noriko is right." Kodachi said. "You'd stick out. You might as well wear a sign that says; I'm a bodyguard." She gave Yuki an evaluating glance. "Slinky, yes, and short."</p><p>Yuki licked her lips. "I don't really have anything like that."</p><p>"I brought a couple outfits." Ami piped up. "We're about the same size."</p><p>"Wonderful." Kodachi enthused. "That's settled." She said. "Now then, where should we go?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The limo pulled up in front of the brightly lit club. Eight women stepped out and into the night. A ninth woman stepped out of the passenger seat of the very long limo and joined them. The sign on the club identified it as being the 'Toyonese'. It was similar to any number of clubs in Nerima. The music played was loud, the dancefloor large and the drinks overpriced. And from the sound of laughter and howls of enjoyment that emanated from the club every time the door opened, popular and crowded.<p>With Kodachi and Noriko in the lead, the women headed toward the entrance. The doorman looked up and a quick smile came to his face. He had the door opened and waving the women in even before they reached him. "I guess we're in." Noriko said in an aside to Kodachi.</p><p>"Did you doubt?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"I'm still learning not to, wherever you're concerned." Noriko replied easily. Noriko had been watching Kodachi most of the evening and was satisfied with what she saw. "Does your influence extend to getting us a table?" She asked impishly.</p><p>Kodachi grinned. "Let's find out, shall we?" Fifteen minutes later nine women found themselves seated at a large table off to the side with drinks in hand and chattering and laughing happily. Well except for Yuki who had a bottle of water and watched everyone in the crowd suspiciously. "Try to relax." Kodachi told Yuki. "Or if you can't relax, at least try to smile."</p><p>Yuki flushed. "Yes My Lady." Yuki tugged at the hem of her dress in an attempt to get it to cover more of her legs than it did. Ami's dress fit her, barely, and Yuki found herself dividing her time between watching the crowd and trying to keep from falling out of the dress.</p><p>Kodachi rolled her eyes. "Noriko remind me to send her on a vacation." She said in a half whisper to Noriko.</p><p>"Of course Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied. She took a smal notebook out of her equally small purse and made a notation. She returned the notebook to the purse. "Well I don't know about you." Noriko said. "But I want to dance." Noriko stood and pulled Kodachi to her feet. "Come on." Kodachi laughed happily and followed Noriko to the dance floor. Yuki followed reluctantly.</p><p>Makoto and Rei sat next to each other at the table and looked around, people watching. Though as far as they were conncerned the people they most wanted to watch was Kodachi and Noriko. "According to Miki, Ms. Kuno and Ms. Mata are lovers." Makoto said in a conspiratoral whisper.</p><p>"Really?" Rei said in fascination. She frowned. "But what about that man we see them with sometimes. What was his name, Kinnikun something." Rei pointed out. "They seemed pretty, close."</p><p>"Honda, Kinnikun Honda." Makoto nodded. "Well Miki says they're lovers also." She said. "All three of them." She laughed quietly. "Miki says a lot of men like having two women." Makoto looked thoughtful for a moment. "I wonder if Genji would like that." She said musingly.</p><p>Rei laughed. "You don't go five minutes without mentioning Genji." She teased. "He must be one hell of a lover." Rei giggled at the blush that appeared on Makoto's face.</p><p>Makoto nodded. "Yeah." She sighed. "Not that Tenchi and Kojro aren't great too but," Makoto sighed again. "Genji is special."</p><p>"He must be." Rei admitted enviously. Not that she was disappointed with her own selections. She allowed herself, as Nodoka put it, to be escorted by two of the acceptable clients.</p><p>So far she had attended a number of small functions in their company. Nodoka had insisted on an itinerary from the two men she had selected. One was to a night club where her date was meeting some important people in his industry. Nodoka had recommended that Rei take the opportunity to perform if it was at all possible. Rei hid a grin as she remembered the extra and generous tip she had received after an impromptu set. Her date informed her, much later, that the other businessmen attending were suitably impressed. With him because of her.</p><p>Auntie was just as suitably pleased with with the man's glowing compliments, though it was a little embarrassing. Nodoka's inquiry over Rei's 'pillow' conversations, as she put it, was as detailed as it was done gentily, using an impressive array of euphamisms from the older woman. To Rei's relief, her dates never expressed any complaints.</p><p>Rei was beginning to get a vague idea of what Auntie and Ms. Kuno were trying to accomplish. 'Just because I'm a whore, doesn't mean I have to be cheap.' She thought in approval. Her income from tips from her singing alone was enough to keep her from ever being desperate and, as she suspected was intended, able to be choosy. 'I think Miki is right.' She thought. 'We're Geisha.'</p><p>Fumie sat at the table with a wide and uncontrollable grin on her face. 'Her best girls', she called us.' She thought in manic glee. 'I'm one of Ms. Kuno's best girls.' Suddenly Fumie jumped up and ran on to the dance floor and toward where Kodachi and Noriko were dancing energetically. Fumie stopped and looked at Kodachi and Noriko hopefully. She giggled in delight when Noriko waved her over. Fumie started dancing and it was obvious she was dancing for Kodachi. A moment later Ami and Aoi hurried over and the dancers formed a small circle.</p><p>Miki looked up and grinned. She looked over to Rei and Makoto. "Hey you two." She nodded toward the dance floor. "Let's joiu the party." Soon there was a circle of eight women dancing together. Or rather there were eight women dancing but seven of the women took turns dancing for and with the eighth.</p><p>There was a ninth woman. Yuki stood off to one side, uncomfortable in her borrowed dress but even more uncomfortable in her feeling of isolation. Though she tried not to admit it even to herself, Yuki felt an unaccustomed jealousy. 'Why should I feel jealous?' She demanded of herself. 'I am a Kuno retainer. My father and mother were Kuno retainers. My grandparents.' She thought. 'And what are they? Whores.' She thought in contempt. Her contempt faded and was replaced by that faint jealousy. 'We couldn't make her happy after Ky.' She looked at Noriko. 'But she could.' She looked at the rest of the women. 'Her best girls, she called them.' Yuki's feeling of jealousy grew stronger.</p><p>"Hey what you doing standing there?" Miki walked over and grabbed Yuki's hand. "Come on Yuki, dance with us." She said.</p><p>"But." Protested Yuki. 'I'm on duty."</p><p>"Well be on duty and dance." Miki said firmly. "It's time for Ms. Kuno's girls' to party."</p><p>"I'm not one," Began Yuki.</p><p>"The hell you're not." Miki interrupted. Miki giggled. "The only difference between you and us, is that at least we get to lie down once in a while." She smiled at the reluctant giggle that came from Yuki. Miki took Yuki by the arm and led her to the circle of dancers. "Now dance."</p><p>"All right Yuki." Ami called. "It's about time you joined us." Her cries of greeting were taken up by the rest of the girls.</p><p>Yuki looked around the circle of faces and finally fastened her gaze on Kodachi. 'My Lady looks so happy.' She thought in wonder. Yuki looked at the faces of the women around the circle. She noticed that most of the time they looked at Kodachi. After a moment Yuki recognized the look. She saw it on Cook's face when he recounted some great deed Lord Kuno had done. Pride, that's what is was. Pride in his Lord. 'Of their Lady.' She thought in understanding. Yuki looked at Kodachi and she wouldn't have been surprised that the same look came to her face as well.</p><p>Yuki began to dance. Hesitantly at first, copying the moves of the women around her. Then, as the evening progressed, more comfortably. An unaccustomed smile of pure joy appeared on Yuki's face.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nine women laughed themselves out of the club and into the late evening air. "Where shall we go next?" Kodachi sang in a slightly tipsy voice. Kodachi spun around. "It's a beautiful evening."<p>Noriko leaned over to Yuki. "Call the driver and tell him to follow us." She said. "Discretely." She added. "I think Ms. Kuno is going to want to walk for awhile." Yuki nodded and pulled out her cell phone.. Noriko walked over to Kodachi and linked an arm through Kodachi's. Without consciously saying anything the nine women started walking down the street. The limo traveled slowly behind eventually holding about a block away as the walk progressed.</p><p>Each of the women responded to the evening in their own way but they all shared a number of things in common. First off they all let Kodachi lead. Even Noriko who, by virtue of place, could have guided their peramulation, let Kodachi set the pace and directions. Then there was the frequent exchange of looks that the following seven women gave each other. Yuki recognized the looks. "Team mates.' She thought. 'friends.' She amended her thought.</p><p>The evening had provided Yuki the opportunity to question a number of assumption she had. Over time she'd come to know, like and even respect Noriko. But Yuki barely knew the other women. The tall and elegant Makoto, much to Yuki's surprise, turned out to be shy and a little insecure about her looks. The long haired Rei had a voice that, even when she was speaking, had a musical quality to it. Fumie, Ami and Aoi were beginning to be the Three Muskateers in Yuki's thoughts and then there was Miki. She turned her head and looked at the attractive woman strolling down the street next to her. ''I see why My Lady called her everybody's big sister.' She thought. You just couldn't help liking Miki.</p><p>'I always wanted a night out with the girls." Yuki thought in bemusement. 'I just thought it would be with a different set of girls.' Yuki suppressed a snort. 'Oh who are you kidding Yuki? You never had any girlfriends. Period.' Yuki walked along and examined her feelings. 'Oh hell Yuki, admit it, you like all of them.' Yuki found herself relaxing. Yuki's feeling of relaxation ended when her trained senses detected something. She stopped walking.</p><p>"Hey Yuki signal when you stop suddenly." Rei complained. "I almost walked into you." She stopped at Yuki's suddenly raised hand. "What?"</p><p>"Shh." Yuki growled. "I thought I heard something."</p><p>Kodachi, hearing Yuki's hush, stopped and turned. Her eye's narrowed and her head turned side to side.</p><p>"What's going on?' Makoto whispered to Rei. Rei shrugged and opened her ears to the night. Her eyes widened. "Someone's screaming." She said. She pointed. "That way." She started running in the direction she pointed. The other women raced after. They reached a dark and deserted decaying tenement and now all the women could hear the screams.</p><p>Kodachi put on a sudden burst of speed and raced ahead. Noriko and Yuki struggled to catch up but the slim gymnast widened her lead. Yuki and Noriko exchanged looks and followed with grim looks on their faces. The remaining six women formed a dense following pack.</p><p>The scene that greeted Kodachi's eyes when she reached the source of the screams was one from her nightmares. A girl, naked and bleeding, was being repeatedly raped by one man while two other cruelly laughing men held her down. One of the men holding the girl down looked up at Kodachi's approach. With an anticipatory grin the man jumped to his feet and raced toward Kodachi. Before he could reach the temporarily stunned gymnast a twin blur raced around Kodachi and barreled into the man. Yuki kicked the man hard in the groin and sent him groaning to the ground. Noriko followed it up with an even harder kick.</p><p>"You. You animals." Shrieked Kodachi in outrage. She approached in a tumbling run that seemed to mesmerize one of the men, the other too busy thrusting into his victim didn't even look up. He only became aware of Kodachi when she kicked him in the head.</p><p>Miki, Makoto, Rei, Ami, Aoi and Fumiko reached the battle scene. Their mouths opened in awe as they watched Kodachi turn from rich socialite to avenging fury. Miki noticed the girl and raced over. "Oh shit." She exclaimed. She gathered the crying and shivering girl in her arms. "It's okay kid, it's over. It's over." She looked over her shoulder. "Someone call an ambulance." She shouted. With a curse Ami pulled out her cell phone.</p><p>The three rapists lost interest in their victim and became interested in escape. One pulled a large knife, almost a small sword in size, out of a holder on his hip. He slashed at the air to force Kodachi away. Kodachi did move away but only to look for an opening. "Animal." She spat again. The man waved the knife. He stopped waving the sword when he was hit by something and made an exclamation of pain and surprise.</p><p>Makoto stooped down and picked up a second rock and flung it hard at the man with the knife. He flung up a hand to protect himself. Then a second missle hit him in the side. Then a third from another direction as Rei joined in. He turned to run but found himself confronting a slim brunette holding a trash can lid. With an angry growl he swung the large knife. The sound of metal meeting metal was loud in the quiet evening as Noriko used the trashcan lid to deflect the knife. Noriko lashed out with her leg, forcing the man to retreat. The man turned and Kodachi was glaring angrily at him. He turned again to find Yuki advancing on him.</p><p>The circle of women closed in on the three men. Kodachi strode out from the pack and toward them. A sudden kick of her leg and the man with the knife found his hand empty. Kodachi raised her hand and the knife fell into her hand as if it were guided. She looked at the blade for a second before she tossed it contemptuously away. As if it was a signal the other women rushed the men. Yuki and Noriko may have been the most trained but the rest of Kodachi's girls were just as angry.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno." Miki's voice from behind caused Kodachi to turn around. The limo was rushing toward them. It stopped in a squeal of brakes and the driver raced out. He stopped as he saw what was happening to the three men. "Take the girl to the hospital." Kodachi ordered. "We'll meet you someplace else." She said. "Miki go with her."</p><p>"Yes Ms. Kuno." The driver helped Miki get the girl into the limo and Kodachi watched the car drive off. She didn't turn around until the car lights vanished in the distance. "That's enough girls." Kodachi snapped. "We musn't be here when the police arrive." She looked at the three weakly groaning men on the ground. "Consider yourselves fortunate." She said to the men in icy tones. "The ambulance may arrive in time to save your miserable lives." She looked around and then turned. Without a word she ran off into the darkness . Kodachi's girls followed.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hotaru Masaki woke up disoriented. She groaned as her body became aware of the aches and pains that sleep had suppressed. "Where am I?" She croaked through a dry throat. Hotaru opened her eyes and looked muzzily around. "Hospital?" She sighed. The door to her room opened and a tall, handsome man with spectacles walked in.<p>"Ah you're awake." The man said. "How are you feeling Ms. Masaki?" He asked as he began taking her vitals. Hotaru flinched at his touch. The man nodded as if her reaction was expected. He raised his hands and stood back from the bed and then walked to the door. "Kasumi could you come in here?"</p><p>An extremely attractive woman walked in. "Ono?" She said. Dr. Ono pointed to the bed and Kasumi walked quickly over. The woman seemed so maternal and so loving that Hotaru found herself relaxing. Hotaru tensed again as Dr. Ono walked back over to the bed. Kasumi eyes widened in understanding. "It's okay, he won't hurt you." Kasumi said gently. "No one is going to hurt you." Kasumi took Hotaru's hand and felt for a pulse. "Pulse is 75, Ono." Kasumi wrapped a sphigmometer around the woman's upper arm and efficiently took the woman's blood pressure. "Normal." She reported.</p><p>"Check for concussion. Ono directed. "And internal bleeding."</p><p>Kasumi nodded. "Now don't you worry." Kasumi said to the young woman as she continued to examine Hotaru and reporting her findings to Ono. Finally Kasumi replaced the blanket over the woman. "There all done." She said.</p><p>Hotaru reached out and grasped Kasumi's hand almost desperately. "Please don't go." She begged.</p><p>Kasumi sat on the edge of the bed. "Shh. It's aright." Kasumi said. "Would you like to talk?" She asked. The woman nodded. "Why don't you finish your rounds Ono." Kasumi said without taking her eyes off of the young woman. Dr. Ono nodded and walked out of the hospital room.</p><p>Hotaru again felt herself relax a bit. "Thank you." She said. "It's just." She broke off and began to cry."They wouldn't, I begged them, they wouldn't, they wouldn't." She sobbed brokenly. "I'm a good girl, a good girl." She half moaned. "It hurt and they laughed. They laughed."</p><p>"Don't worry they're not laughing now." Kasumi said with a gentle tone that didn't hide her anger. "The girls made sure of that." Her voice took on a tone of satisfaction.</p><p>"The girls?" Hotaru asked. "You mean it wasn't a dream?" She said. "They were real?"</p><p>"Oh very real." Kasumi replied.</p><p>"I thought they were angels." Hotaru said quietly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi sat moodily in a chair in the library. An untouched cup of tea at her elbow. She frowned as the library door opened. "I thought I said I didn't want to be disturbed." She said angrily.<p>"Auntie Dachi?" Said a childish voice.</p><p>"Kiko?" Kodachi looked up. "What are you doing here?" She extended her arms. "Come here baby." Kiko ran over and soon was sitting in Kodachi's lap.</p><p>"Auntie Noriko called and said you were sad. So I came over." Kiko said. "Why are you sad Auntie Dachi?" She asked in childish concern. "Did someone hurt you?" She said with a touch of anger in her voice.</p><p>"No, I wasn't hurt." Kodachi hugged the little girl. "But someone was and, and." Kodachi sighed. "Oh gods I'm glad you're here." She hugged the child again.</p><p>Noriko closed the door to the library. "Thank you for bringing her Koko." She said. Koko nodded. The two women started walking through the mansion and stopped at a door. Noriko knocked and opened the door. Seven women were sitting around a coffee table.</p><p>Yuki looked up. "How is My Lady?" She asked.</p><p>"Better. She's with Kiko." Noriko replied. She smiled reassuringly. "She'll be fine by this afternoon. She's more upset over the girl than anything else." She looked at the assembled women. "Well, I don't know about the rest of you but it's too pretty out to stay indoors." Noriko continued. "Why don't we all have lunch by the pool?" She said. "And then get some sun."</p><p>"I'm in." Rei said quickly. She looked at her gold complexioned arms. "I'm turning into a ghost." Rei pouted at the laughter that arose. "Well I am." She protested.</p><p>Noriko stood. "Excellent." She said in unconscious imitation of Kodachi. "I'll talk to Cook and meet you at the pool."</p><p>"I'll go with you." Yuki jumped up.</p><p>"You gonna hang out with us by the pool?" Miki asked. "If anyone deserves it, you do."</p><p>"Of course she will." Noriko said firmly. "Isn't that right Yuki?"</p><p>Yuki hesitated. "I really shouldn't." She began. "Well maybe for a little while." She said changing her mind. She smiled shyly at the happy exclamations that rose from the women. Yuki waved to the women and followed Noriko out of the suite. Yuki was silent for a while. "Makoto surprised me." She said finally. "They all surprised me." She admitted. "But Makoto more than any of them."</p><p>"Kept her head." Agreed Noriko. "And Rei," She shook her head. "She's better than radar." She said. "But Miki is the one that I admired the most." She declared. "went right to the girl." Noriko and Yuki exchanged looks. "You thinking what I'm thinking?"</p><p>"If you're thinking that there's going to be some more people training regularly." Yuki replied. "Then yes."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi, in a tiny black bikini, and Kiko in a black bikini more appropriate for a child, strolled toward the pool. The little girl obviously trying to imitate Kodachi's swaying gait. Kodachi leaned down. "Why don't you go to your Mommy, baby." She said. "I'm sure she misses you."<p>Kiko looked at Kodachi. "Okay but you call me if you feel sad." She scolded in imitation of her mother.</p><p>Kodachi knelt down and hugged the little girl. "I will Kiko." She said. "Thank you." Kodachi stood and gave Kiko a little push. Kiko giggled and raced off to find her mother. Kodachi watched her run off. Not for the first time did she regret what might have been. She turned as Noriko walked over.</p><p>"Still upset?" Noriko asked. She handed Kodachi a cocktail glass.</p><p>Kodachi llooked at the glass then took it. "A little." Kodachi admitted. She took a sip of the drink then sighed. "But then I'd have to be upset with myself, wouldn't I?" She said.</p><p>Noriko shrugged. "Maybe, maybe not." She said. "You would have been a bit more artistic I believe."</p><p>Kodachi snorted. "Definitely." She looked down at her drink. "Thank you for Kiko." She said "Thank you for worrying,"</p><p>"That's what friends are for." Noriko chewed her lip for a second. "I called Lady Kuno." She reported. "She said not to worry. She'd take care of it." She smiled lopsidedly. "Then she asked to be warned the next time the Fallen Angels decide to have another girls night out."</p><p>"Fallen Angels?" Kodachi asked in sour tones. "Oh just wonderful." Then she threw her hands skyward in resignation. "Well I've heard worse names." She said. "I know, I just know I'm going to be hearing that name from now on." Kodachi looped her arm through Noriko's. "Do you think the girls would be willing to, as Nabiki put it, have another girls night out?"</p><p>"Try and stop them." Noriko said. They reached the pool's bar. Miki was behind the bar mixing drinks. Makoto in a bikini covered by a short, gauzy robe and her head covered by a wide straw hat was seated at the bar sipping a drink. Makoto looked up at Kodachi's approach.</p><p>"Good afternoon Ms. Kuno." Makoto called in greeting. "I'm happy to see that you're feeling better."</p><p>"Thank you Makoto." Kodachi replied.</p><p>"Good afternoon Ms. Kuno." Miki said. "Can I freshen your drink?"</p><p>"I'm alright for now but thank you Miki." Kodachi replied.</p><p>Fumie, Ami and Aoi hurried over from the poolside. "Good afternoon Ms. Kuno." They chorused.</p><p>"Good afternoon ladies." Kodachi replied. A wet sound made Kodachi turn. Rei and Yuki still dripping water from the pool approached quickly.</p><p>"Good afternoon Ms. Kuno." Rei said musically.</p><p>"Good afternoon My Lady." Yuki said with a hurried and deep bow.</p><p>"Good afternoon." Kodachi rolled her eyes. "You could have dried off first." Kodachi put her hands on her hips and survey the assembled women. "I am not going to have a repeat of last night." She said sternly. "The very idea." She exclaimed. "Rei what were you thinking; running ahead like that?" She fixed the singer with a steely eye. "Next time you just point."</p><p>Rei fought down a smile. "Yes Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"And you Makoto." Kodachi continued. "Rocks?" She shook her head. "You could have cut yourself and ruined your hands. We will find something more appropriate."</p><p>Makoto didn't even attempt to hide her grin. "Yes Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"And the huffing and puffing I heard from some of you." Kodachi said in annoyance. "It's my fault. I have been too lax in letting you control your own training. " She said. "That stops. From now on all of you, without exception, will be training under proper supervision." She wagged a finger. "Is that understood?"</p><p>"Yes Ms. Kuno." Chorused the women. Including, to Kodachi's hidden amusement, Yuki. 'So.' Kodachi thought. 'She now identifies herself with them.' Kodachi ran her eyes over the assembled women. "Noriko please make the arrangements."</p><p>"Of course Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied with a small smile.</p><p>End Fallen Angels - First blood</p><p>Author's Notes: Well this is the end of this piece. It was more of a side story that got out of hand then anything else. Still it finally introduced the Fallen Angels, my homage to Sailor Moon. Queen Rat is going on hiatus for a short time while I, drum roll please, work on Book 10 of Couch Trips.</p><p>Later all.</p>
