</div><p>Chapter 2</p><p>'Mom had a date'</p><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight." The pretty, bespectacled brunette said into the camera. "I'm your host Mitsui Oh, Saatchi Kato is on vacation." The reporter turned in her chair. "Well tongues were wagging in elite society this week as the normally reclusive Michiko Osakawa, heir to the the Osakawa fortune, reappeared on the social scene after a long absence."</p><p>The reporter turned to face another camera. "And what a splash she made." She said as a picture appeared on the screen behind her. The picture showed a trim and fit Michiko Osakawa in a well tailored and revealing evening gown and in the company of a woman wearing an even more revealing iridescent violet gown though the woman incongruously wore a head covering reminiscent of the head coverings worn in the more repressive Muslim countries. "Ms. Osakawa and the mystery woman in violet have been seen for the past week all over Tokyo." She said as the image of the woman in violet expanded to show only her violet made up eyes. "So far all we know is that she answers to the name Sumire but those that have had the good fortune to speak to her have all come away impressed, even awed, over the depth of knowledge the woman has displayed in an extraordinarily wide variety of subjects."</p><p>The reporter turned to face another camera. "Who is she?" She asked rhetorically. "Where does she come from?" She said. "We'll be interviewing several people who've had the opportunity to speak to the mysterious Sumire." She said. "When we come back."</p><p>"And off." The director called.</p><p>Mitsui Oh leaned back in her chair and sighed happily. "And here I thought I was going to have trouble finding interesting cover stories with Saatchi gone." She said to no one in particular. Her cosmetician hurried over and made some adjustments to the reporter's makeup. "Not everyone has access to the Ice Queen or the Terrible Three or even Kodachi Kuno like Saatchi had." The reporter said. The cosmetician nodded as she worked. "Thank you, Sumire." She said earnestly. She waved her hands. "Okay, enough." She said. "We're about to start." The cosmetician made a last adjustment and walked away just as the director started his countdown. Three fingers, Two, then one.</p><p>"And we're back." Mitsui Oh said into the camera. "Our first guest is Lady Rei Aoki, the matriarch of the Aoki clan and one of Tokyo's wealthiest women. A great socialite and philanthropist as well as an accomplished historical author, Lady Rei was gracious enough to come on the show and discuss her first impressions of the mysterious Sumire." The reporter stood. "Lady Rei." She said. She applauded along with the audience as a woman in an expensive kimono walked on stage. The woman was in her late middle age who was gracefully entering her senior years. She seemed to almost sail over to the reporter. Mitsio Oh bowed. "Lady Rei, a great honor." She waved to one of the two chairs in the interview area. Mitsui waited for the older woman to sit before taking her own seat.</p><p>"Lady Rei, thank you for coming on the show.' The reporter began.</p><p>"Thank you for having me." The woman replied. "Especially to talk about Lady Sumire."</p><p>"Lady Sumire?" The reporter asked in surprised and curious tones. "Have you learned something?" She asked in suppressed excitement.</p><p>The woman laughed self consciously. "Oh my no." She replied. "But..." The woman smiled helplessly. "The woman is so incredibly charming and astonishingly well informed." She said in admiration. "Why, she seemed to know more about me than I knew myself." She added. "And, oh my, incredibly well read as well." She shrugged delicately. "We just started calling her that out of respect." The older woman leaned forward though obviously delighted by the attention she put a serious expression on her face. "But whoever she is, her life must have been...tragic."</p><p>"Tragic?" Asked the reporter. 'Oh this is wonderful.' She thought. "Why do you say that?" She asked.</p><p>"Her reticence to speak about her own past, spoke volumes in itself." The woman replied. "Even the most innocent question seemed to bring the poor thing almost to tears.' She said. "No wonder Mitch took her under her wing." She said.</p><p>"Mitch?" Asked the reporter.</p><p>"Michiko Osakawa, dear." The woman said in slightly disappointed tones. "All her friends call her Mitch."</p><p>"Unfortunately, I've never met the woman." The reporter replied self consciously. 'Oops.' She thought. "Let alone being her friend." She said. 'Note to self, better background research.' She thought.</p><p>The older woman's expression thawed. "Unfortunate is correct, Ms. Oh." She replied. "Mitch was always taking up one hopeless cause after another. Always putting her all into it." She said. "But so terribly, terribly shy around people." She added.</p><p>Mitsui Oh made a signal with her hand and the picture of Michiko Osakawa and Sumire appeared on the screen behind her. The reporter looked at the picture. "She doesn't look very shy here." She commented.</p><p>"Isn't it wonderful?" The older woman gushed. "She's like a catapiller that has finally become a butterfly." She said. "I'm sure Sumire had something to do with that." Suddenly the woman blushed but said nothing.</p><p>"So what else can you tell us about Sumire?" The reporter asked."She's obviously Japanese."</p><p>The older woman laughed. "Obviously." She said. "Unfortunately that seems to be about the only thing anyone can agree on." She said. "Why Kodachi Kuno even had the effrontery to suggest that Sumire was just a common girl playing dress up." She laughed again. "Common girl, indeed." She snorted. "No, she's definitely from a family of some note, only a certain class of people have that level of articulation, that certain type of poise...the bearing." She laughed again. "No, whoever Sumire is, she's certainly no Cinderella."</p><p>"So, Lady Sumire may not be so...far off." MItsui Oh suggested.</p><p>The older woman gave Mitsui Oh an approving nod. "No, not so far off, at all."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A limo pulled up the long driveway to the Kuno mansion. Even before it came to a stop, the front door of the mansion opened and a young girl of twelve ran out and down the steps. "Pema." She called happily. "Kagomi."</p><p>The door of the limo opened and two very attractive teen aged girls stepped out. "Kiko." Chorused Pena and Kagomi as the three girls hugged each other happily. Despite the age differences between the older girls and Kiko, the three were fast friends and frequent companions. Not that Kiko didn't have friends her own age, she did, lots of them as the frequent parties at the mansion testified. But there was a special bond between the three girls.</p><p>"Oh, I'm so glad you're here." Kiko said breathlessly. She linked her arms through Pema and Kagomi's and the three skipped up the stairway to the house. "Now I know we'll have a good time." She declared.</p><p>"We always have good time, yes." Agreed Pema. "Where friends?" She asked when they entered the mansion.</p><p>"They're coming tomorrow." Kiko said. "And Mom and Auntie Dachi are working late tonight."</p><p>Pema and Kagomi looked at each other. "Slumber party." They said together. Kiko squealed happily in agreement.</p><p>Minutes later found the three girls in the bedroom, suite actually, that Kagomi and Pema usually stayed in when they visited the mansion. As was also usual, Kagomi and Pema sat on one of the beds while Kiko sat on the floor and Pema was already brushing Kiko's hair. "So, tell me all new." Pema said. "You got boyfriend yet?" She asked with a giggle.</p><p>Kiko giggled in response. "No." She replied. "No boyfriend, but I think Mak Inada likes me." She said conspiratorially. "He's fourteen, you know." She said.</p><p>"What is it about older men?" Kogomi said in arch tones. She, Pema and Kiko giggled. "Better watch yourself. Shrimp." Kagomi said knowingly. "He might try to kiss you."</p><p>Kiko squealed in embarrassment. "Kagomi." She said in complaint. She looked down and chewed her lip. "Not that he notices me when Mitsuki is around." She grumped. "Ever since she started..." Kiko put her hands in front of her chest. "Growing, all the boys...honestly, is that all boys think about?" She complained.</p><p>Pema and Kagomi giggled."Pretty much, shrimp." Kagomi said. "Don't worry, Shrimp, if you're anything like your mother, the boys will soon forget about Mitsuki." She declared.</p><p>"Oh that reminds me." Kiko said excitedly. "Mom had a date." She said with obvious approval. "It must have been a good date." Kiko said. "Cause Mom was smiling for days."</p><p>"That wonderful." Pema said, "Your Momma very nice woman, she should have good man." Pema declared. "She should be happy."</p><p>"Can't argue with that." Kagomi added. "Popcorn." She said suddenly. "We need Popcorn." Kagomi got up from the bed and padded over to a metal grill set into the wall. She pressed a button. "Hello Mr. Cook." She sang into the grill.</p><p>"Good afternoon, Miss Kagomi." Cook's deep voice rumbled from the speaker. "Let me guess, popcorn?" His laughter rang loud from the grill. "Give me fifteen minutes."</p><p>Fifteen minutes almost to the second, there was a knock on the suite door and one of the many Kuno retainers wheeled in a trolly. She rolled the trolly to the center of the room and uncovered the lidded items, revealing not only popcorn but drinks and some additional dainties. With a bow and a smile for Kiko the woman left.</p><p>Kagomi grabbed the popcorn and the three girls sat on the floor in a circle and chatted away. For Kiko, Pema and Kagomi were the older sisters she never had and found she desperately wanted. For Pema and Kagomi, Kiko was a favorite little sister. Pema especially found Kiko a unexpected comfort and substitute for her own missed sisters. And, for Kagomi, an only child and an orphan, Pema and Kiko represented the family she had lost. Not that they didn't tease each other, they did, frequently, but that just added to their shared feelings of family.</p><p>The three girls chatted for hours before Pema looked at her watch. "Oh, must call Ranma." She said. "Must say good night."</p><p>"You guys are so lucky." Kiko said enviously. "Living with Ranma and Akane and Ukyo."</p><p>"Look who's talking, shrimp." Kagomi shot back as Pema called home. "You're at the mansion more than your own home." She said. "Not to mention you get to...dress up." she grinned. "Speaking of which, how are the girls?" She asked. Kagomi turned to Pema. "Don't hang up, I want to say good night too." She turned her attention back to Kiko. "Has Piyo Piyo made another appearance?"</p><p>"Kagomi." Kiko said in complaint. "You know I hate being called Piyo Piyo." She said. "That's a baby name."</p><p>"Well I don't think there's a Shrimp bird, so I think you're stuck with Piyo Piyo for awhile." Kagomi teased. "But, you know , I kind of agree with you. You're getting too old to be called Piyo Piyo." Kagomi said. "I know, Why don't we pick you a new name?" She suggested. Kagomi turned to Pema again. "Give me that." She said and reached over and took the cellphone from Pema. "Hi." She said. "Hey Akane." She said. "Where's Ranma and Ukyo?" She giggled at something Akane said. "Again?" Kagomi giggled again. "Tell you what, when Pema and I come home..." She stopped and started giggling uncontrollably. "You're so bad." She said. "Love you." She said. "Give a...kiss to Ranma and Ukyo for me." She grinned. "Night Akane."</p><p>"Night Akane." Called Kiko.</p><p>"Here's Pema again." She said and handed the phone back to Pema. Kagomi waited until Pema finished her good nights. "Kiko needs a new name." Kagomi said.</p><p>"New name?" Pema asked in confusion.</p><p>"Her angel name, she's too old to be called Piyo Piyo." Kagomi explained.</p><p>"Ohhh." Pema breathed. She looked at Kiko. The young girl was definitely beginning to take on a more feminine shape. Pema also knew that Kiko considered her inclusion as one of the Fallen Angels as one of the most important things in her life. "Kagomi right, Kiko no longer little chick."</p><p>"I knew you guys would see that." Kiko saiid gratefully. "Not like Mom and Auntie Dachi." She grumped. "They still think I'm a baby."</p><p>"You know that not true." Pema scolded gently. "They know you not baby, just not know, know."</p><p>"Huh?" Kiko said in confusion.</p><p>"They see you as baby because they see you with heart." Pema explained. "In you Momma's heart, in your Aunties heart you always be little Kiko." Pema smiled. "Heart always last to know."</p><p>"So, what do I do?" Kiko asked plaintively.</p><p>"I think first thing you do is talk to Madam Demille." Pema said.</p><p>"Madam Demille?" Kiko exclaimed in disbelief. "You're kidding."</p><p>Pema shook her head. "Pema no kid." Pema replied. "If you show Madam Demille you not little girl, Madam Demille tell Momma and Auntie." She pointed out. "If Pema or Kagomi say..." Pema shook her head. "They not listen same way they listen to Madam Demille."</p><p>"Perma's got a point, Shrimp." Kagomi said. "Madam Demille may be tough, but she's fair." She said. "And she does listen." She said. "All you have to do, is talk to her." Kagomi tousled Kiko's hair. "But be yourself." She cautioned. "Show Madam Demille the real Kiko is growing up."</p><p>"Listen to Kagomi." Pema said firmly. "Now, I think that enough talk about growing up." She declared. "Now we talk about party." She grinned. "And...boys." She said. "So...is Mak cute?"</p><p>Kiko giggled. She nodded. "Uh huh."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sumire wandered through the club greeting different patrons as she passed. She was, of course dressed in violet and wore one of Koko's latest creations, a head covering that covered her hair, and her nose but exposed her violet made up eyes and violet tinged lips and gave Sumire a vaguely serpentine appearance. The violet dress was one of Sumire's favorite as it was the first one she had worn. Long in the back and very short in the front it exposed her legs. The low cut bodice exposed plenty of shoulder and breast. Her skin had been lightly dusted with a violet tinged powder. She was truly the embodiement of Sumire.</p><p>Being a hostess at Ky's Cafe was not what Sumire had imagined. She was expected to ensure that the patrons were,in a phrase, having a good time. Sometimes all that meant was making sure a patron had fresh water or a glass of wine, other times she'd sit and talk to them. But above all it meant being...Sumire.</p><p>Saatchi was amazed at herself for how quickly she became Sumire. How easy it was to...be Sumie. It was as if a heretofore unsuspected personality had always lurked just below the surface waiting for the right circumstances to come out. Sometimes she felt that she really was Sumire and that Saatchi Kato was the pretend personality.</p><p>Sumire smiled at a pair of men sitting at a table and walked over. One of the men was good looking in a greasy sort of way with slicked down hair and a thin mustache and shiny dark gray suit, the other was, in Sumire's opinion, cute though in desperate need of a better haircut. 'Why do men comb over their bald spots?' She thought While his clothing was appropriate it was obviously something bought off the rack. "Good evening, gentlemen." She said in warm greeting.</p><p>"Good evening." The greasy looking man replied while slowly letting his eyes roam over her body. The other man gave a preoccupied greeting while craning his neck obviously scanning the small afternoon crowd.</p><p>"Is your friend looking for someone?" Sumire asked ignoring the first man's ogling. 'Creep.' She thought.</p><p>The first man rolled his eyes. "Oh Hiro's hoping to see this woman he met last week." He said. He turned to the second man. "Honestly, Hiro, I don't know what you saw in her." He said. "She's not even pretty." He declared. "Pretty damn ugly if you ask me."</p><p>"She's not ugly." The second man said firmly. "She's...she's..." He looked down. "She was nice to me."</p><p>"Aw man, you could do so much better." The first man said. "There are dozens of girls here." He pointed out. "Pretty girls, not one's with scars on their faces." He shuddered. "I don't even know why they keep her here." He said in disgust. "I'm sure she scares the customers."</p><p>"Scar?" Sumire asked. "You wouldn't happen to be speaking of Koko would you?"</p><p>"Do you know her?" The second man asked eagerly. "She was here last week." He said. "We...we...she said she had a good time." He looked down and shook his head. "She was probably bored out of her mind." He said woefully. "I'm not...not really good with women."</p><p>The first man rolled his eyes. "Hiro, Hiro, Hiro, what am I going to do with you?" He said. "There are plenty of girls here who'd be just as nice as that freak was." He said.</p><p>"She isn't a freak, Kyoshi." Hiro replied vehemently. "She was smart and warm and...and...I...I liked her."</p><p>Sumire rose. "Excuse me gentlemen." She said with a warm smile for Hiro and a cursory nod to Kyoshi. "I need to check on something. I'll be back in a moment." She walked away scanning the crowd. She smiled and changed direction. "Hey Fumie."</p><p>"Hey Sumire." Fumie replied. "What's up?"</p><p>"You know that guy Koko was talking about?" Sumire asked. "The sweet one?"</p><p>"Yeah?" Fumie asked. "What about him?"</p><p>"Well he's at table twenty three and looking for Koko." Sumire replied. "Not my type, but I can see why Koko's attracted to him."</p><p>"Cute, huh?" Fumie asked with a grin.</p><p>Sumire nodded. "Cute in a puppy dog kind of way." She explained. "And already in love with Koko."</p><p>"Oh, really?" Fumie replied as she searched through the pocket of the small apron all the hostesses wore. "Ah, knew I had one." She pulled out a very familiar envelope. "What makes you think he's in love with her."</p><p>"Because the guys he's with, a real creep by the way, was bad mouthing Koko and Hiro, that's his name, looked like he was just about to slug him." She said. "Was real loud defending her." Sumire looked at the envelope. "You wouldn't."</p><p>"Sure I would." Fumie said cheerfully.</p><p>"He didn't look rich, Fumie." Sumire cautioned. "I think his buddy is though."</p><p>Fumie smiled amd nodded. "Kinda figured that." She said. She tapped the envelope. "And it's not that I don't trust your instincts, Sumire, but we can't have Koko having her heart broken, now can we?" She leaned closer. "Now, you keep the creep distracted while I talk to, what was his name again?"</p><p>"Hiro." Replied Sumier. "And how distracted?"</p><p>"Just distracted enough to not pay attention to me and Hiro." She grinned evilly. "And leave the rest to me."</p><p>The two women walked back toward the table with the two men. Hiro looked up in anticipation when Sumire returned but his face fell when he realized the woman with her was not Koko. Sumire sat near the first man while Fumie sat next to Hiro. It was easy to distract the first man since he basically never took his eyes off of Sumire's breasts. A few judicious wiggles and some deep breaths were all that it took. He even tipped her.</p><p>Fumie sat down next to Hiro. "So." She began. "You're interested in Koko?" She asked. Hiro nodded eagerly. Fumie shook her head. "I don't know." She said slowly. "Koko is one of Ms. Kunio's top girls and very special."</p><p>Hiro nodded rapidly in agreement. "She is." He sighed. "She's the warmest, sweetest..." He broke off. "Aw, who am I kidding?" He grumped. "Why would she be interested in a nobody like me?"</p><p>"Well, that's what we're trying to find out." Fumie smiled warmly. She placed the envelope in front of Hiro. "Why don't you give her a reason to be interested?" She said. Fumie handed Hiro a pen. "Start writing." She ordered.</p><p>Hiro looked at the pen and the envelope. "I thought these were for...you know." He said slowly. "I can't afford a..."</p><p>"Companion?" Suggested Fumie. "That is what you are looking for, isn't it?" She said. "It's not always about money, honey." She said. "Tell her how you feel."</p><p>Hiro took the pen and with a deep breath slowly began to write.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Koko was sitting in Kodachi's office going over the schedules. Besides her duties as makeup artist and hair stylist Koko also made sure that there were no conflicts in scheduling for the girls and that they were not overworked and took days off and saw the doctor regularly. It wasn't a difficult task but it was time consuming. Koko liked it as it gave her some privacy during the evening. 'Besides, I don't have to be reminded of what I'm missing.' She thought moodily. She sighed and returned to the computer. There was a knock on the door. "Come in." She called.</p><p>The door opened and Fumie walked in. "Hey Koko." Fumie greeted the older woman. "Got a little problem." She said. "Seems a client has bid on someone who isn't on the roster." She waved the envelope. "I thought it was a pretty generous offer and I thought you might...talk to her."</p><p>"That's not standard policy, Fumie." Koko said in slightly annoyed tones. "We're not..." She sighed. "Oh, I suppose it won't hurt to talk to her." She reached out her hand. "Who's the...lucky girl?"</p><p>Fumie grinned and handed Koko the envelope. "You." She said.</p><p>"M-m-me?" Squeaked Koko. She took the envelope like she was handling a snake. "Wh-wh-who?"</p><p>"Just look at it, honey." Fumie replied.</p><p>Koko gingerly opened the envelope and extracted the paper inside. She began to read. In moments her hand went to her mouth. As she read her hand went to her breast, just over her heart and her eyes began to tear up. When she finished reading she put the paper down and stared at it for a long time. "I-is he still here?" She asked in a faint voice.</p><p>"I put him in booth ten." Fumie replied. "So..." Fumie stopped and grinned as Koko raced out of the office.</p><p>Koko ran out of the office and through the main part of the the club. She slowed as she approached one particular booth. It seemed that someone, probably Fumie, had closed the privacy curtain and Koko hesitated. 'Okay Koko, it's just a man. You've had plenty of men.' She told herself. 'Sure you had a good time but...' She swallowed nervously and wiped clammy hands on her dress. Koko stared at the privacy curtain for what seemed like an eternity before she finally parted it. "Hiro?" She said softly.</p><p>Hiro stood quickly. "Koko." He breathed.</p><p>Koko shivered at the look in Hiro's eyes and for the first time in a very, very long time Koko felt the thrill of being desired and she felt her body respond in kind. Her breath seemed to catch in her throat. She swallowed a few times. "May I sit down?" She asked in a slight quavering voice.</p><p>"P-please." Hiro almost gasped. "You..I...you..." To his relief, Koko sat. He sat back down. "I don't know how to begin." He said finally. "I couldn't stop thinking about you and I had to beg Kyoshi to bring me here, even though I can't stand him, and...gods I wanted to see you again. To hold you again." He said in a rush. "And when the, um, hostess said I should...oh gods, you probably think I'm..." He stopped when Koko put a hand over his mouth.</p><p>"I think you're very sweet and very nice." Koko said. "And I had a wonderful time last week too." She sighed. "And I so want to you to hold me right now." She wiped at her eyes.</p><p>"Gods, you don't know how much I want to hold you." Hiro replied emphatically.</p><p>Koko giggled sadly. "Hiro." She said in a quiet voice. "I-I have to tell you something." She said. "Something important." She looked down at the table. "About me."</p><p>"You don't have to..." Began Hiro.</p><p>"Yes, I do." Koko replied quickly. "The girls here, the hostesses, they're...they're more than just hostesses." She said looking at the table. "Some provide...extra services."</p><p>"That's what Kyoshi said but..." Hiro said.</p><p>"Hiro." Koko put her hand along her scarred cheek. "If it wasn't for this...if it wasn't for this...I probably would be one of those girls because I was one of those girls." Her voice was almost a whisper when she finished.</p><p>Hiro was silent for a long time. "I-I was never good with women." Hiro said and he too looked at the table. "I didn't have a single date through High School and you could probably count on one hand the number of dates I've had since." he said in embarrassed tones. "I'm not much to look at, and can't tell a joke or make small talk, and...I took ballroom dance classes just so I could touch a woman." He said in self disgust. "I only came here last week because Kyoshi was paying." He looked up. "And then I met you." He said in tones of wonder. "And suddenly I found myself with a woman who seemed to actually like me and there I was telling jokes and laughing and dancing and...and it felt like it was the most natural thing in the world." He smiled helplessly. "For the first time in my life I really felt like a man." He said. "I don't care what you were, I don't care what you did, all I care about is that I want to be with you and make you laugh and dance with you...and...and love you, if you'll let me." Hiro stopped and looked back down at the table. It was quiet in the booth for a long time.</p><p>"Hiro." Koko whispered.</p><p>"Yes, Koko." HIro whispered back.</p><p>"This is where you're supposed to kiss me." Koko whispered.</p><p>"Is it?' Hiro replied in a hopeful voice.</p><p>"Yeah." Koko replied in breathless anticipation.</p><p>"Oh." Hiro leaned toward Koko. She met him more than halfway and the kiss that followed made Hiro's ears ring.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sumire continued to talk to Kyoshi. 'I bet he doesn't even realize Hiro's gone.' She thought in dismissal. 'Now to get out of here myself." She thought. "There you are." Came a stern voice. Sumire turned. Standing behind her was Michiko Osakawa with her legs spread and her arms on her hips. "Mitch?"</p><p>"Don't Mitch me." Michiko said in disapproval. "I turn my back for one second and what do I find?" She pointed a finger. "You." She moved the finger. "With...that?" Michiko gave Kyoshi a disapproving look. "It's one thing to cheat on me." She declared. "But with...that?"</p><p>Sumire stood. "I'm not cheating on you, Mitch." She replied in indignation. "And if I was, It certainly wouldn't be with..." She pointed at Kyoshi. "Him."</p><p>"Hey." Protested Kyoshi.</p><p>"You were shaking your tits at him." Michiko accused.</p><p>"That's my job., Mitch." Sumire said in protest. "I'm supposed to shake my tits."</p><p>"Even to...that?" Mitchiko replied. She winked at Sumire.</p><p>Sumire fought down a grin. Instead she looked down and sighed heavily. "Even...that." She said woefully.</p><p>Michiko wrapped her arms around Sumire. "Oh, you poor baby." Michiko said loudly. "How you must suffer."</p><p>"It's terrible, Mitch." Sumire sobbed and cuddled closer to Michiko. "Just terrible." Michiko started stroking her hair. Sumire wrapped her arms around Michiko's waist. "Forgive me?" She asked.</p><p>"I'm the one who should be begging your forgiveness, baby." Michiko replied. "It's just that I get so jealous."</p><p>"You have no reason to be jealous, baby." Sumire replied. Stepped back but kept her arm around Michiko's waist. Michiko put her arm around Sumire's waist. "If I wanted you to be jealous, I'd pick someone more believable."</p><p>"Hey." Kyoshi's voice came after them as they continued walking away.</p><p>Sumire walked over to another table where a couple were sitting. Both man and woman were in their thirties and attractive. "Now he's more believable." Sumire said. The man smiled. Sumire pointed at the woman. "And she's..." Sumire paused. She leaned over to the woman. "What are you doing later, honey?" She asked. The woman blushed.</p><p>"Sumire." Scolded Michiko. "That was flirting." She accused. "That was most definitely flirting." Michiko pulled Sumire away.</p><p>"Just a little bit." Admitted Sumire. She turned around. "Bye honey." She said.</p><p>End Chapter 2</p>
