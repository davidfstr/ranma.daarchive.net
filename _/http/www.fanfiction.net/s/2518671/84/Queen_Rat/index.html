</div><p>Chapter 4</p><p>'Forgiveness'</p><p>Two limousines pulled into the long winding driveway of the Kuno mansion. In the first limosine sat Cologne, Elder and matriarch of the Joketsuzoku and the two remaining Joketsuzoku women whose loyalty she commanded. Apparently the only reason these two had not been relieved of their duties was out of some remaining feelings Shampoo retained for the old woman. Shampoo had explained that she didn't want Cologne to feel totally isolated or unprotected. "Impudent child." Muttered Cologne.</p><p>"Elder?" One of the two remaining Joketsuzoku asked.</p><p>"Nothing, nothing." Cologne replied peevishly. She looked out of the tinted the windows of the limo. "How goes the search for Hika?" She asked quietly.</p><p>"Slowly, Elder." The other warrior replied. "To be frank, Elder, the two of us are ...insufficient to conduct a proper search." She said. "All whomever is hiding her needs do is move her once or twice a month and unless we were very lucky we'd never find her."</p><p>"Hiding her?" Cologne asked.</p><p>"Of that we are certain, Elder." The woman replied. "But that's all we are certain of."</p><p>"Have you tried contacting Gosunkugi?" Cologne asked. "He is quite talented at finding people."</p><p>"The Ice Queen's Ghost?" The first warrior asked in horror. "Your pardon elder but that does not seem...wise."</p><p>"Bah, are you warriors or frightened children?" Cologne asked. "Despite his appearance, he's a living man." She shook her head in annoyance. "Never mind, we can discuss this later." She said. "We are here."</p><p>The two limos slowed to a stop in front of the wide staircase. Cologne and her two aides exited from the first, while Shampoo, Miki, Makoto and Yuki exited from the second. A moment later, Genji Morimoto exited from the front passenger seat.</p><p>Yuki immediately turned her attention to Cologne and her aides. While Yuki wore her collar there was no leash attached. Yuki walked to stand on one side of Shampoo while Makoto stood on Shampoo's other side. And just as Yuki did not wear her leash, Makoto already had on her special gloves. With Miki leading the way, Shampoo and her two flanking Angels. Genji Morimoto brought up the rear thereby completely surrounding Shampoo.</p><p>Cologne shook her head in annoyance and started her own ascent up the stairs. Considering the gravity of the situation, Cologne decided to forgo her normal pogoing mode of transportation and opted for a more stately though less effective walk up the long stairway. Before either group reached the top of the stairs, the door to the mansion opened and Nabiki, Lady Kuno, The Ice Queen appeared alone in the opened doorway. True to her nickname the expression on her face was cold and distant.</p><p>As Shampoo's group, being in the lead, approached Miki, Makoto and Yuki moved aside to allow Shampoo to greet Nabiki. Shampoo stopped at the top landing and bowed nearly in half. Nabiki returned the bow with an infinitesimal nod of her head. Cologne reached the landing and gave Nabiki a short nod. Again Nabiki replied with a barely noticeable nod of her own. Without a word, she stepped back from the door to permit her visitors to enter.</p><p>Cologne entered first. "A waste of time if you ask me." She grumbled as she strode through the wide doorway.</p><p>"I didn't." Nabiki replied in her coldest Ice Queen voice. "And it is my time to waste or not." She said in cold reminder.</p><p>"Thank your seeing us, Ice Queen." Shampoo said as she entered.</p><p>"I should not have had to." Nabiki replied in the same cold voice.</p><p>Shampoo paled slightly. "I apologize for causing trouble." She said. "But it unavoidable."</p><p>"We shall see." Nabiki replied. She waved a hand. "My office." Without waiting to see if anyone would follow, Nabiki started walking slowly into the recesses of the Kuno mansion. She walked to a hallway that led to her office. Nabiki hid any expression from her face. It was a task that was more difficult than usual, Shampoo's unexpected deference and her obvious lack of confidence was puzzling. 'Ah.' Nabiki thought in sudden realization. 'Hika.' She nodded mentally. 'Interesting. she thinks her position is weak because of Hika.' She thought.</p><p>Nabiki stopped at a door flanked by two retainers. She nodded and one of the retainers opened the door. Nabiki entered. Again she did not look back to see if she was followed. Nabiki walked to her desk and sat down behind it. Only then did she apparently look up to see if anyone was there. Nabiki hid another smile. Cologne had already climbed into one of the two chairs in front of the desk while Shampoo continued standing. Both Cologne's and Shampoo's entourages had entered and had taken positions along the back of the office. The two Kuno retainers seemed a little confused over who they should be guarding so settled on taking up positions on either side of Nabiki. "Sit." Nabiki said shortly to Shampoo.</p><p>The office suddenly became even more crowded when Tatewaki Kuno, Kimi Ota, Kodachi Kuno, Kiko Kuno and Noriko Mata arrived. It became more crowded still when another Kuno retainer arrived. He was pushing a large cart upon which were a number of covered trays and chafing dishes. He was a fat, bald headed man who wore a short gray brimless cooks cap, "Too many people in here." The man said. A second retainer, a woman wearing a long skirt and long sleeved blouse and with her hair covered by a scarf began removing trays and placing them along a side table.</p><p>"Cook." Nabiki said in exasperated tones.</p><p>"Who knows what germs they might have." Cook continued.</p><p>"Cook." Nabiki rubbed her nose with her fingers. "I'm sure they're all healthy as oxen." She said.</p><p>"I made you and Lady Kimi a salad of fresh citrus fruits and crisp greens." The cook continued. "Dr. Ono has permitted one Mimosa." He said.</p><p>"Cook...a Mimosa?" Nabiki smiled slightly.</p><p>"After you finish your salad." Cook female retainer placed a small plate in front of Nabiki and brought a second one to Kimi. She soon returned with a two glasses, one of water and one of the promised Mimosa. Nabiki picked up the mimosa and took a sip. She nodded. It was weak but she tasted the champagne.</p><p>"I hope there's enough for Shampoo." Nabiki said.</p><p>"I couldn't..." Began Shampoo.</p><p>"I insist." Nabiki said firmly.</p><p>"Enough." Cologne barked. "We have important things to discuss." She growled.</p><p>"Not on an empty stomach." Cook said.</p><p>"I quite agree,: Kodachi announced. She accepted a plate from the female retainer with a smile. "Thank you." She said. The retainer nodded and brought a plate over to Kiko. "Oh this salad is divine, Cook." Kodachi exclaimed.</p><p>"Thank you, My Lady." Cook replied.</p><p>A very confused Shampoo picked at her salad. She nodded in appreciation. The salad was indeed good. "I think this be very popular at club." Shampoo said to Cook. "Unusual dressing."</p><p>"I'd be more than glad to give you the recipe, Ms. Shampoo." Cook replied. "Well, I must get back to the kitchen." He looked at the female retainer. "You will remain and see to Lady Kuno's guests." He said. The woman nodded and retreated to where the food was laid out. Cook bowed to the people in the room and left.</p><p>"What's it like working for Ms. Shampoo?" Kiko asked Miki.</p><p>"Yes, Miki." Kodachi added. "Do tell us."</p><p>"Better than we had anticipated, Ms. Kuno." Miki said crisply. She pulled out a computer notebook and quickly found a file. "Ms. Shampoo has done an excellent job of eliminating some of the more serious problems created by Tokio Wasuhara though there is still much work to do." She reported. "Especially in in the North East section of Kita."</p><p>"There still bad feelings there." Shampoo admitted. "Tokio cause much anger."</p><p>"No doubt." Kodachi agreed. "Pray continue, Miki."</p><p>"To be honest, working for Shampoo herself is...she's not living up to her reputation." Mike said with a smile. "Or rather, she's a lot less of a bitch than I expected."</p><p>"Oh thank you so much." Shampoo said sourly.</p><p>Miki smiled. "Her girls like her." Miki continued. "So do her men." She said. "Though there is some grumbling."</p><p>"They're just not used to having a woman in charge." Genji Morimoto supplied. "I've spoken to some of them." He said. "They didn't like Tokio much but..." He shrugged. "It might help if she had a couple high placed men as lieutenants." He said in suggestion.</p><p>"Probably." Nabiki said in agreement. "So basically what you're saying is that Shampoo is meeting expectations."</p><p>"I would say so, Lady Kuno." Miki replied. "Exceeding some." She added with a smile.</p><p>Nabiki nodded. She looked toward the side board and caught the attention of the retainer. Nabiki pointed to her plate. The woman quickly made up a new plate of salad, carried it over to Nabiki and retrieved the used plate. The woman then retreated once again to her station. Nabiki took a bite of her salad. "I've spoken to Kyoshi Nerumi." She said. "His assessment matches Miki's." She said. "I really don't see the problem." She said. "Shampoo is doing what is expected so I have no reason to replace her."</p><p>"The problem." Rasped Cologne. "Is that she refuses to acknowledge my command." She said. "Kita is..."</p><p>"Kita mine." Shampoo interrupted. "I do work. It mine."</p><p>"I've had quite enough of your impertinence, Shampoo." Cologne said threateningly. She stopped as Nabiki slammed her desk with the flat of her hand.</p><p>"You forget where you are, Cologne." Nabiki said coldly. "More importantly, you forget who I am."</p><p>"How dare you speak to me like that." Cologne spat. "I could..."</p><p>"I'd be very careful with your next words, Cologne." Nabiki interrupted. "This is not China and you are not in charge." She said icily. "Now, I suggest we all refrain from making...statements we might regret." Nabiki took a sip of water. The Kuno retainer hurried over with a carafe and filled it. Nabiki gave the retainer a smile.</p><p>"I...apologize." Cologne rasped reluctantly.</p><p>Nabiki leaned back in her chair. "We'll say no more about it." She placed a hand over her stomach. Her other hand picked up the glass containing the half finished Mimosa. "As I was saying, I don't really see the problem." She said. Nabiki took a sip of the drink. "Between Shampoo and Ting Li, the Joketsuzokuzu are in possession of more assets and more influence then ever before." She gave Cologne a cold smile. "What do you really want, Cologne?"</p><p>Cologne was silent and the people in the room could feel the palpable rage that radiated off of the old woman. "What I want." She hissed. "Is my legacy."</p><p>"By that I assume you mean,,,the child." Nabiki replied. "HIka's child."</p><p>"Of course I mean the child." Cologne snapped impatiently. Behind Cologne, Kiko had walked over to the female retainer and took her hand and gave the retainer a reassuring pat on the hand. Makoto and Yuki also seemed to drift over to the side table and idly scanned the table as if deciding if they wanted something additional to eat. In doing so they, apparently accidentally, blocked Cologne's two aides view of the Kuno retainer. "I've spent the better part of a century on this and I will not be denied."</p><p>"Indulge me, Cologne." Nabiki said. "What exactly is your legacy?" She asked. Cologne seemed about to reply but then with a visible effort remained silent. Nabiki smiled. "Won't answer?" She asked in amused tones. "Then how about if I answer for you?" She said. "Let's start with you, Cologne, Honored Elder and Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku." She said. "You are, what, over one hundred years of age yet are quite..." Nabki chuckled. "Robust."</p><p>Cologne narrowed her eyes at Nabiki but remained silent.</p><p>"Joketsuzoku live long time." Shampoo offered.</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "That's putting it mildly, Shampoo." Nabiki replied. "Life expectancy for a Joketsuzoku is, as best as we can determine, about one hundred ten years." Nabiki leaned back in her chair. "And you, Cologne, are nearing the end of that number of years." Nabiki picked up her drink glass and grimaced when she realized it was empty. She sighed and picked up her water glass and took a sip. "We all know that the Joketsuzoku have been running a breeding program for centuries but knowing is not always the same as understanding."</p><p>"I Joketsuzoku and I no understand." Shampoo put in.</p><p>"That's because only Elders know the true story." Nabiki replied. "If and when you became an Elder you would have learned exactly what the goal of the Joketsuzoku really is." Nabiki turned her attention back to Cologne. The old woman was visibly trembling. "Honestly Cologne, wasn't Saffron a big enough warning?"</p><p>"Saffron is why we were doing it." Snapped Cologne.</p><p>Nabiki rubbed the bridge of her nose. "Obviously." She replied. "I've always wondered, was Saffron a natural mutation or an...experiment gone wrong?" She smiled coldly. "Never mind, it isn't really important." She said in dismissal. "Regardless, the Joketsuzoku have spent centuries trying to breed the ultimate warrior." She said. "A female warrior."</p><p>"Why female?" Kodachi asked in fascinated tones. Then she barked a laugh. "Oh of course, Saffron's genes are too good to waste." Kodachi raised an eyebrow. "So Hika is supposed to be the...mother of a god?"</p><p>"More like grandmother or possibly great grandmother." Nabiki replied. "That was your intent, wasn't it Cologne?" She asked. "Especially after Ranma, defeated Saffron."</p><p>"Saffron still lives." Rasped Cologne.</p><p>"Yes, but Ranma did stop him, at least temporarily." Nabiki replied. "And when you thought Ranma, and his genes, were lost to you, you searched for...another Ranma." She said. "And found...Hikaru."</p><p>"He was close, so close." Cologne mumbled.</p><p>"And since Shampoo is as close to the perfect Joketsuzoku as possible..." Kodachi said musingly. She gave Shampoo a look that was both amused and sympathetic.</p><p>"The child will be...exceptional." Cologne exclaimed. "A dozen generations skipped." She said. "Hundreds of years saved." Cologne got to her feet. "We must have the child." She said in desperation. "We must."</p><p>"And Hika?" Nabiki asked. "What of her?"</p><p>"Yes, Cologne." Kodachi added. "What of Hika?" She got up and walked over to the old woman. "Did you plan on using her as a brood mare or were you just going to...put her out of her misery once the child was born?"</p><p>"Oh I suspect they would have kept Hika alive for a little while, at least." Nabiki sad in the iciest of Ice Queen tones. "The child might be a boy." She pointed out. "And even if the child was female...there'd be no guarantee she'd make it to puberty." She continued. "There would need to be... spares."</p><p>"That's horrid." Kiko exclaimed. "Mother, you can't allow..."</p><p>"Hush, Kiko." Kodachi said. "Hika will be fine." She turned her attention back to Cologne. "So, does Lady Kuno have the right of it?" She asked. "I don't know which I find more distasteful." She continued without waiting for an answer. "Your plans for Hika or your plans for Hika's child."</p><p>"Don't forget Shampoo's child." Nabiki put in. "Or any other children Ranma may father." Nabiki extended a hand and Kimi placed a folder in that hand. Nabiki opened the folder, closed it and then extended it to Cologne. "This is a copy of a letter Ranma gave me." She smiled wryly. "You may find it...interesting."</p><p>Cologne took the folder cautiously. She opened it slowly. She started to read the letter. "Impossible, a forgery." She exclaimed after reading no more than a sentence.</p><p>"I assure you, it is quite genuine." Nabiki replied.</p><p>"It can't be." Cologne protested. "I never wrote this." She said. Despite her protestation she continued to read the letter. "I never wrote this." She mumbled over and over. Cologne seemed to visibly shrink as she continued to read. Finally she closed the folder. To everyone's surprise the old woman was crying. "I must...think on this." She muttered. Without a word she turned and, leaning heavily on her staff, walked slowly out of the room.</p><p>The moment Cologne left the room, there were three soft thumps as Ranma, Akane and Ukyo dropped from the ceiling. "I knew that letter would get her." Ranma said. He looked at the surprised looks on the faces of everyone except Nabiki. "What?" He asked. "Did you think I was going to let you guys try dealing with Cologne on your own?"</p><p>"I would have protected My Ladies." Tatewaki rumbled disapprovingly.</p><p>"Cologne wasn't after Nabs or Kimi, Tatewaki.:" Ranma replied. "She was after Hika." Ranma turned to the retainer. "How come she didn't notice you?"</p><p>"I-I-I" The retainer clenched a fist. "I haven't for-forgotten everything she t-taught me." Hika declared.</p><p>"Hika." Gasped Shampoo. "You here all along?" She gave the pink haired former hit man a searching look. "You look better."</p><p>"D-don't talk to me." Hika said angrily.</p><p>"Now, Hika." Kodachi said. "Remember what Dr. Ono said about your blood pressure." She said. Kodachi turned back to Shampoo. "You will keep Hika's location a secret." She said in dire tones.</p><p>"Don't worry." Ranma replied. "She will." Shampoo nodded rapidly. "And Shampoo's right, you do look better." Ranma grinned. "I think motherhood agrees with you."</p><p>Hika looked down at her feet. "I-I think so t-too." She said.</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Never thought I'd say this but I think I envy you."</p><p>"What in letter, Ranma?" Shampoo asked. "I never see Great Grandmother cry before."</p><p>"You'll have to ask her." Ranma replied. "So, Nabs, what ward were you planning to give Hika?" He smiled. "Be a bit of a waste to not use her skills."</p><p>"Minato." Nabiki replied.</p><p>"M-minato?" Hika gasped in surprise.</p><p>"That's assuming you're interested." Nabiki replied. "Ranma is right, it would be a waste." Nabiki smiled. "Now I think we've all had enough excitement for today." She declared. "Why don't we all retire to our rooms." She said.</p><p>Shampoo rose. "I suppose I should go." She said quietly.</p><p>"I said all." Nabiki said sternly. "That included you." She said. "We still have some things to discuss." She stood. "But that can wait until tomorrow." She said.</p><p>"Miki, you have your usual room." Kodachi said. "Genji, the red suite of course." She smiled as Makoto clapped excitedly. "And Shampoo, I've given you a room in the green suite." The smile on Kodachi's face could only be described as mischievous. "I hope you don't mind sharing the common room with Ranma and his women." She said. "Dinner tonight will be semi-formal." Kodachi stood. "Kiko, Noriko, Hika, if you will." She said. She walked out of the room followed by Kiko, Noriko and Hika.</p><p>"I surprised I invited." Shampoo murmured.</p><p>"I'm not." Akane said. "Not after the glowing review Miki gave you." She said. "I'm surprised that you were being nice to Hika."</p><p>An embarrassed look appeared ion Shampoo's face. "To be honest, I surprised too." She said. "But when Shampoo see Hika..." She looked down. "You ever wish you able start over, not make same stupid mistakes?"</p><p>"All the time Shampoo." Akane replied earnestly.</p><p>Hika followed Kodachi out of the office. It had taken all her courage to walk into the office earlier, even with all the assurances she had received from Kodachi and Nabiki. Seeing Cologne had almost make her lose control of her ki but she fought down the panic and maintained control, allowing her to disguise her ki and her identity. A long absent glow of accomplishment suffused her and the balm of success eased some of the pain in her fractured psyche.</p><p>Kiko, walking next to Kodachi, looked back at the trailing pink haired woman. "Mother." Kiko said leaning close to Kodachi to speak. "I think there's something wrong with Hika." She whispered. "She has the oddest expression on her face." She continued.</p><p>Kodachi looked behind her. "Scamp." She said to Kiko. "It is good to see her smile." She agreed. "You did very well, Hika." Kodachi said in a louder voice. "Lady Kuno was impressed."</p><p>"Na-nabiki always had a wi-wicked sense of humor." Hika replied.</p><p>"Hey, that's pretty good, Hika." Kiko said. "You barely stammered."</p><p>Hika took a moment before she answered. "Thank you, Kiko." She said deliberately.</p><p>"Very good." Kiko said in approval. "Now, head up." She said in obvious imitation of Madam Demille. Hika smiled and lifted her head. "Remember, you're a lady now." Kiko continued.</p><p>"Yes, Kiko." Hika replied.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo escorted Shampoo to the Green Suite. The door led to a common room. It was a large and well appointed room. There were two leather couches and two leather chairs making a conversation nook. The leather covering the couches and chairs was a deep, rich green as were the porcelain urns flanking a fireplace. Even the walls had been painted a deep green. A wet bar with a green marble top stood in the corner.</p><p>There were two doors on either side of the common room. Ukyo walked over to one and opened it. "Dibs." She called to chuckles from Akane and Ranma. Akane and Ranma had taken over one of the couches and Akane was comfortably cuddled up against Ranma. Shampoo's expression became both sour and wistful when Ukyo sat down and cuddled up against Ranma's free side. "No have to rub it in." She muttered.</p><p>"Yes we do." Ukyo said cheerfully. She pointed to the facing couch. "Oh sit down and try to look on the bright side." She said. "You got nearly everything you wanted."</p><p>Shampoo sprawled more than sat on the couch. She placed one hand over her belly. "Yeah, yeah." She replied. Shampoo was silent for a long moment. "Whatever in letter, it no stop Great Grandmother long." She said quietly.</p><p>"Maybe not, but it should make her think." Akane replied. "And no we're not going to tell you what was in the letter." She added with a smile. "Except to say it was...a love letter."</p><p>"Love letter?" Shampoo asked in surprised. "I no think Great Grandmother ever love anybody." She said in slightly dismissive tones. Shampoo sighed. "No think my people really know what love is." She said sourly. "We say 'Wo Ah Ni' but..." Shampoo shrugged. "Just words."</p><p>"Well maybe you can do better with Xing Xing." Akane replied.</p><p>Shampoo looked up in surprise. "Xing Xing?" She asked. "How you know that name?" Shampoo gave Akane a puzzled look. "Shampoo only start thinking of baby names." She shook her head. "Thought Xing Xing be good name but..." Shampoo shook her head again. "Somehow name not seem right."</p><p>"Probably not." Agreed Akane.</p><p>Once more silence filled the room. "Hika look almost...happy." Shampoo rubbed her belly again. She sighed. "Stupid to care." She muttered.</p><p>"Is he going to change back?" Ranma asked in curiosity. "Speaking of which, you don't change into a ...you know, any more."</p><p>Shampoo smiled slightly. "That something Shampoo discover on own." She said proudly. "Found right way to use water from magic spring." She said. "I show Ranma if he want."</p><p>"I'll pass." Ranma replied.</p><p>Shampoo nodded in understanding. "Shampoo not know about Hika, not know how Great grandmother lock Hika as woman." She said. "Maybe after baby born." She shrugged. "Maybe." Shampoo rubbed her belly again. "I wish I could have drink." She muttered. "But if Great grandmother use water from spring..."</p><p>"She could change back a couple months after giving birth." Ukyo finished. "Not that I think Hika's likely to care by then." She said. "There doesn't seem to be a lot of Hikaru left." Shampoo nodded almost sadly in response. "Why don't you just go and..." Ukyo said hesitantly.</p><p>"Apologize?" Shampoo replied grumpily. "Oh like she believe." She said. "Or even talk to me." Shampoo sighed. "If Shampoo were Hika, Shampoo not want talk to me." She said. "Shampoo woman, supposed know better." She grumped. "But what Shampoo do? Shampoo act like stupid man." She sighed again. "Compared to Shampoo, Akane almost gentle." She shook her head in disgust. "No, not almost." She corrected herself. "Akane gentle."</p><p>"Gentle, huh?" Akane said in amusement. "You really do like it rough."</p><p>"What Shampoo mean," Shampoo said in annoyance. "Is that Akane not hit, not force." She looked down. "If man do to Shampoo what Shampoo do to Hika, man be dead now."</p><p>"Now that sounds familiar." Akane said quietly. "If you're looking for forgiveness Shampoo, you're talking to the wrong girl."</p><p>Shampoo sighed. "Shampoo know."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Yuki stood in the middle of the room with a nervous look on her face. "Do I look okay, Makoto?" She asked. Yuki was wearing a black dress that was hemmed an inch or so above her knees. She wore black heels and around her neck was a string of pearls. On her wrist was delicate wrist watch of gold and diamonds. One of the first gifts she received from Genji.</p><p>Makoto, also wearing a black dress, though her's was even shorter to show off her long shapely legs, circled Yuki as she critically examined the Kuno retainer. The relationship between Makoto and Yuki was complex. While neither Makoto nor Genji would ever even dream of being cruel to Yuki, they did expect a certain deference from Yuki. As mentioned before, there were times Yuki would go out of her way to be 'punished', just as Makoto would be very flexible as to what constituted an infraction, but this wasn't one of them. Tonight, Yuki did not want Makoto, and by extension Genji Morimoto, to have cause to be critical.</p><p>Finally Makoto nodded. "You'll do." She said to Yuki's relief. "Just remember that you're 'off the leash' only because we're having dinner with Lord and Lady Kuno." She said. "But I'll expect you to show the proper deference to Genji."</p><p>"Yes, Makoto." Yuki replied earnestly.</p><p>"I'll also expect you to keep an eye on Shampoo." Makoto continued.</p><p>"I will, Makoto." Yuki promised.</p><p>"Good." Makoto replied. Makoto sighed.</p><p>"Something wrong, Makoto?" Yuki asked in concern.</p><p>Makoto shook her head. "Not wrong." She said. "It's just that, oh, it's just...Lady Kuno and Lady Kimi and Shampoo and, and even Hika are, are..."</p><p>"Are what?" Genji's voice asked from behind. Makoto and Yuki turned to see Genji enter the bedroom. He wore a dark suit with matching vest, a tie dangled from his hand.</p><p>Makoto blushed. "Oh, Genji." Makoto looked down. "They're all...pregnant." She said quietly. "And, and..."</p><p>"Ah." Genji said in understanding. "Do you want a child?" He asked gently.</p><p>Makoto nodded without raising her head. "Your child, Genji." She admitted in the same quiet tones. "If...do...do you...I mean.." She waved a hand. "You need an heir, Genji." She said. "And I...I want...oh Genji, I can't believe I'm saying this but I want a baby."</p><p>Genji smiled. "That's another reason why I love you, Makoto." He said calmly. "And why I know you married me because you love me." He said. "If you had married me for my money you would have either become pregnant without discussing it with me first..."</p><p>"I'd never do that, Genji." Makoto protested.</p><p>"I know." Genji replied. "As I was saying, if you had married me for my money you would have just gotten pregnant or would have divorced me by now and tried to get as much out of me as possible." He said. "But you, my pretty Makoto, are truly concerned about what I want." He chuckled. "A baby, huh?" He asked. Makoto nodded eagerly. Genji chuckled again. "Never thought I'd be a father at my age." Makoto shrieked in glee and threw herself into Genji's arms.</p><p>Yuki smiled widely as she watched Makoto and Genji embrace. 'And I'll make sure nothing ever happens to the child.' She promised silently. 'My lady Makoto.'</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>HIka looked up at a knock on her suite door. "Yes?" She said.</p><p>"It's Kodachi." Kodachi announced through the door. "May I come in?"</p><p>Hika quickly walked over and opened the door to her suite. "Ms. Kuno." She said. Hika bowed.</p><p>"Goodness." Kodachi protested. "You don't need to bow every time you see me." She said.</p><p>HIka looked down. "Y-yes, I do." She said.</p><p>Kodachi looked at the bowed head of the former hit man. "We can discuss that later." She said. "Let me look at you." She said. Kodachi examined the pink haired woman. Hika was wearing a conservative gray dress that reached to her ankles. Hika's pink hair was pulled back from her face and tied into a pony tail. "Hmm."</p><p>"D-do I lo-lo-look..." Hika clenched her fist. "Do I look okay?" She asked.</p><p>"You look fine." Kodachi replied reassuringly. "Though you really should wear makeup."</p><p>"Ma-ma-ma-makeup?" Stammered Hika.</p><p>Kodachi smiled slightly. "Makeup." She declared. "A lady wears makeup." She said. "Too bad Koko is not here, she has a gift." She said. "So, I suppose I'll have to do it for you." She said. Kodachi waved a hand. "Come along, Hika." Kodachi walked out of the suite. A moment later, Hika followed.</p><p>They walked to the second floor where Kodachi had her own quarters. As they approached Kiko stuck her head out of Kodachi's suite. "Oh there you are Mother." Kiko said. "Hi Hika." She tilted her head. "Mother, why does Hika look frightened?" She asked.</p><p>"I have no idea." Kodachi said innocently.</p><p>"Ma-ma-ma-makeup." Hika stammered.</p><p>Kiko giggled. "Makeover time." She said gleefully.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma examined his reflection in the compact's mirror. His was wearing eyeshadow in shades of red and brown and his complexion had a smoothness and eveness that came with expertly applied makeup. Even his lips bore the unmistakeable though subtle indications of lipstick. "You look fine, Ranma." Akane said in amused tones.</p><p>Ranma snapped the compact closed. "Yeah." He replied smugly. "I do." He shifted his broad shoulders to settle the jacket of his dark gray silk suit.</p><p>Akane laughed. She was wearing an electric blue sleeveless and high hemmed dress she had found in the suite's voluminous and well stocked closet. Ukyo came out of the bedroom wearing a sliver and red cocktail dress. She was putting on a pair of earings as she walked out. Akane whistled in appreciation. "Damn you have fine legs." Akane exclaimed.</p><p>"I've always liked them." Agreed Ranma.</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "You guys." She said in cheerful protest."Looking good, Ran-chan." She said. "And speaking of legs, Akane honey." She continued. "If any pair of legs deserve a 'Damn', yours do."</p><p>"Why thank you, Uk-chan." Akane replied. "I feel good tonight." She walked over and linked an arm through Ranma's. "Uh, uh, Uk-chan." Akane said when Ukyo went to take Ranma's other arm. "Over here." She said waving her free arm. She linked her free arm through Ukyo's. "That's more like it."</p><p>Ukyo and Ranma laughed. "Well I guess we know what the Tomboy wants tonight." Ranma said to Ukyo.</p><p>"And that's different from every other night, how exactly?" Ukyo replied.</p><p>"Greedy, that's what she is." Ranma returned. "Just plain greedy."</p><p>"Oh look who's talking." Akane shot back. "Complaining?"</p><p>"Hell no." Ranma exclaimed. "I may be dumb but I aint stupid." He grinned as Akane giggled. "Just like old times, huh guys?"</p><p>"Just like, Ran-chan." Ukyo said. "Come on, we'd better head down to dinner before the Tomboy convinces us to skip dinner and just spend the rest of the night in bed."</p><p>"Since when did you need convincing, Uk-chan?" Akane said teasingly. "I feel good." She repeated. "Hell, I feel so good I don't even mind having Shampoo around." She said.</p><p>"You think it's real?" Ukyo asked as they headed toward the door to the common room. "Shampoo I mean."</p><p>"Nabs thinks so." Akane replied.</p><p>"So does Mom." Ranma added. "By the way Tomboy, Mom is a little annoyed that her first grandchild is not coming from you." He said. "I told her we've been a little busy."</p><p>Akane blushed. "Uk-chan and I will go see your Mom next week." She promised. "To discuss... things."</p><p>They walked into the common room to find Shampoo, dressed in a cocktail dress, similar to Ukyo's, in shades of blue and white.. Shampoo was pacing back and forth across the room when they walked in but stopped when the door opened.</p><p>Akane raised an eyebrow at Shampoo's dress. "Blue and white." She said musingly. "I think that's her way of declaring her...allegience." Akane said to Ukyo. "Sort of like when we all wear red and black." Akane shrugged. "Come here, Shampoo." She called. Shampoo looked over in surprise and walked over. Akane didn't say anything more, she just stared coldly at Shampoo. Finally Shampoo sighed and sank to her knees. Akane nodded. "That's right." She said. "Now get up." She ordered. Shampoo rose to her feet. "Ranma?" Akane said.</p><p>"Your call, Tomboy." Ranma said.</p><p>Akane nodded. "Ranma gave me a chance when I fucked up." Akane said to Shampoo. "And I fucked up a hell of a lot worse than you." she saidd. "To quote Pema, you're a bitch and a whore but..." Akane blew out a breath. "You're Ranma's woman." She said. "Now stop moping."</p><p>A lopsided smile appeared on Shampoo's face. "Thank you, Akane." She said. "Do I...?"</p><p>"You know the deal." Interrupted Akane. "You ask me, you ask Uk-chan and then you ask Ranma." She said. "Just be glad I'm in a good mood." Akane smiled slightly. "Or I'd be making you ask Pema."</p><p>"You really are in good mood." Shampoo said in more normal tones.</p><p>Akane laughed. "Well, I suppose we should go down to dinner." Akane said finally. "You lead the way, Shampoo."</p><p>Shampoo looked over at Ranma's unoccupied arm. She looked at Akane. "It okay?' She nodded toward Ranma's arm.</p><p>Akane smiled slightly. "I'm okay with it." she said. "Uk-chan?"</p><p>"I'm okay with you holding his arm, but that's all I'm okay with." Ukyo replied. "Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma held out his free arm. "Like Uk-chan said, I'm okay with the arm." He said as Shampoo eagerly took his arm. "But you ain't sleeping with us tonight." He said. "Let's go guys."</p><p>When they arrived at the dining room they found that they were the first to arrive. The Kuno retainers flanking the dining room entry way opened the doors and bowed the four into the room. Another retainer walked over with a tray filled with appetizers. Shampoo maintained her hold on Ranma's arm, a contented smile on her face.</p><p>Next to arrive were Genji Morimoto, Makoto and Yuki. Though Yuki was not wearing her leash she stood in her usual place just behind Makoto. Miki arrived a minute later and, after greeting Ranma and the women with him she went over to talk to the Morimotos and Yuki.</p><p>Tatewaki, Nabiki and Kimi came next. Tatewaki wore a dark gray suit very similar to Ranma's while Nabiki and Kimi wore matching black and white cocktail dresses. Tateewaki accepted a glass of wine from one of his retainers, while Nabiki and Kimi were somewhat pointedly given glasses of fruit juice.</p><p>Tatewaki looked around. "My sister and her guest have not yet shown?" He asked. Tatewaki signaled to one of his retainers. "My Sister?" He asked.</p><p>"On her way, My Lord." The retainer replied. "I understand there was a last minute...detail to take care of." The door to the dining area began to open. "I believe that's your Sister now."</p><p>The door opened slowly and at first no one entered. Then Kiko Kuno stepped into the room. She was wearing a black cocktail dress and she wore her hair in a ponytail. "Migods, she looks just like Kodachi at the same age." Tatewaki said in shock.</p><p>"My Lord, My Ladies. Honored guests." Kiko said formally. "Please excuse our tardiness." She continued. "We do hope you'll agree that the reason was justifiable." Kiko smiled and then bowed. "My Lord, My Ladies, Honored guests, I give you..." She stepped away from the entrance. "Kodachi Kuno and...Hika."</p><p>All eyes had been looking at Kiko now all eyes looked at the door expectantly. Kodachi, wearing a black cocktail dress very similar to Kiko's walked into the room with a pink haired woman holding tightly on to one hand. The pink haired Hika had somehow been convinced to change from the conservative gray dress she had worn earlier into a shorter, though still conservative, black dress that fell just below her knees. Her hair had been brushed until it fell in a shining pink waved that framed her face. It was her face that caused a sudden intake of breath from the observers.</p><p>Not only had Kodachi and Kiko been able to convince Hika to wear makeup the make up was both dramatic and sophisticated. Her eyes were shaded in pinks and light browns, her lips a pale but glossy pink. Even her fingernails were painted a matching pink. Hika hesitantly walked into the room.</p><p>"Oh my." Breathed a voice breaking the silence. "Hika...Hika look beautiful." Shampoo blushed when she realized it was she that had spoken aloud.</p><p>Akane and Ukyo looked at each other then started clapping. Their claps were taken up by the rest of the guests.</p><p>Hika seemed to shrink for a moment. "Head up." Kodachi said. "A lady makes an entrance whenever she can." Hika swallowed and slowly raised her head. "Better." Kodachi said. "Accept their applause as your due." She said. "Now Ladies come along and let's greet my Brother and his Ladies." Kodach and Kiko each took one of Hika's hands and led Hika over to Tatewaki, Nabiki and Kimi. "Brother, Lady Kuno, Lady Kimi." She said.</p><p>"You never cease to amaze, Sister." Tatewaki said in admiration.</p><p>"Thank you, Brother." Kodachi replied. "Though you give me credit for what rightfully belongs to Hika." She turned her head slightly. "Hika."</p><p>Hika licked dry lips. "Go-good evening Lord Kuno. Lady Kuno. Lady Kimi." The pink haired woman said. "Th-thank you f-f-for inviting me." She bowed. Her bow was returned by Tatewaki, Nabiki and Kimi.</p><p>Kodachi led Hika to where Genji Morimoto, Makoto, Yuki and Miki were standing and watching the proceedings with open astonishment. Hika bowed. "Mr. and Mrs. Morimoto. Yuki, Miki." Hika said. Genji and Makoto bowed in return. Yuki hesitated for a moment as did Miki, then they too bowed in response.</p><p>As they walked away, Miki leaned over to Makoto. "She's introducing Hika as if...oh my." She said in realization. Yuki and Makoto nodded slowly.</p><p>Kodachi then led Hika over to another group of four. Kodachi could feel Hika start to shake. "I-I do-don't know if...if...if..."</p><p>"You must and you will." Kodachi replied. "If it makes you feel any better, I suspect Shampoo is beginning to feel just as...overwhelmed." She said.</p><p>"I think she looks scared." Kiko added.</p><p>Shampoo was worried. It was beginning to become clear that one of the reasons she had been invited to dinner and to spend the evening was this very moment. Even holding on to Ranma's arm did not dispell Shampoo's sudden feeling of isolation. She turned to look at Ranma and found the pony tailed martial artist looking back at her with an amused look on his face. The look quickly shifted from amused to challenging as he quietly unlinked his arm from hers. Her gaze shifted to Kodachi's and she saw the same challenging look in the gymnast's face. Shampoo decided not to look at Nabiki or Kimi.</p><p>Kodachi, Hika and Kiko stopped in front of Ranma. "Good evening." Hika said slowly. She bowed</p><p>Ranma bowed in return. "Good evening, Hika." Ranma said. "You're looking...good." He said in appreciation. "Though I would have gone for a bolder color around the eyes." He said. "Ow." He said when Akane elbowed him.</p><p>"Don't listen to the jerk," Akane said. "He's just jealous." She said. "Good evening, Hika."</p><p>"Good evening, Akane." Hika replied. She bowed. "Good evening, Ukyo." She said. Ukyo bowed.</p><p>Shampoo now really felt isolated as she could almost feel all eyes on her. She looked at Hika. The pink haired former hit man was visibly trembling. Shampoo chewed her lip for a second then sank to her knees. 'Once more on your knees, Shampoo.' She thought in resigned dismay. Shampoo bowed her head.</p><p>Shampoo sensed someone kneeling down in front of her and she raised her eyes to see Hika looking at her. Shampoo and Hika looked into each other's eyes for a long time. "Di-did you hate m-me that much?" Hika asked.</p><p>Shampoo lowered her eyes. "Remember Hokkaido?" She asked. "When Shampoo betray you?" Hika nodded slowly. "Do you know why?" Shampoo asked.</p><p>Hika shook her head just as slowly. "I still do-don't remember every...everything." She replied.</p><p>"Shampoo remember." Shampoo continued. "Ranma call you stupid, call Hikaru stupid." She said in correction. "Because Hikaru not know, not care where Shampoo was." She said quietly. "Hikaru say he not need partner, not need anyone." Shampoo raised her eyes. "Hikaru treat Shampoo like whore." She said. "Shampo now know she is whore but then she not know." She said. "It hurt." She said. "Maybe it Shampoo fault." She admitted. "Shampoo treat Hikaru bad, Shampoo know that now but Hikaru treat Shampoo bad too."</p><p>Hika listened silently as Shampoo explained. Finally Hika nodded. "Yes." She said. "I remember." She said.</p><p>"Shampoo want hurt Hikaru way Hikaru hurt Shampoo." Shampoo continued. "And when Great Grandmother order Shampoo to...give Hika child, Shampoo remember how bad Hikaru treat Shampoo and Shampoo..." Shampoo sighed unhappily. "Shampoo do." Shampoo placed her hands on the ground in front of her and bent over until her forehead touched the ground. "If Hika want Shampoo life." She said to the ground. "Then life belong to Hika," She said. "Shampoo only ask that child Shampoo carry be born first."</p><p>"Child?" Hika's voice trembled in shock. "Whose?"</p><p>"Mine." Ranma answered. "So I would really appreciate it if you'd spare Shampoo's life." Ranma said seriously. "If only for the child's sake." Ranma nodded toward where Shampoo was still bent over. "Shampoo may be a homicidal bitch but she's...my homicidal bitch." Ranma chuckled. "I take that back, she's the Tomboy's bitch."</p><p>"Damn straight." Akane agreed. "Isn't that right, Shampoo?" Akane purred.</p><p>"Yes, Akane." Shampoo said to the floor.</p><p>"We're getting off the subject." Kodachi said impatiently. "And I'll thank you to watch your tongue while Kiko is present." She said scoldiingly. "Whatever Hikaru did has nothing to do with Hika." Kodachi declared. "And no I am not forgetting who and what Hika was." She explained. "But whether your great grandmother intended it and whether or not Shampoo's ... actions is the cause, the woman you see in front of you is not Hikaru." She said. "Not anymore." Kodachi walked over to where Hika was kneeling in front of the prostrate Shampoo. "Get up Shampoo." She ordered. Kodachi waited until Shampoo rose back to her knees.</p><p>Kodachi raised her hand to her neck where a thin gold chain hung. She pulled the necklace from between her breasts to reveal a misshapen bullet. Kodachi looked at the bullet. "What has been done cannot be undone." She said softly. "But, hard as it may seem sometimes, we can go on." She retunred the bullet to its place between her breasts. Kodachi took a breath. "Hika, I know this will be difficult but, for Ky's sake, you must try to forgive Shampoo." She said. "As, I hope, you will one day forgive me."</p><p>The look of shock on Hika's face was reflected in nearly all the faces of all the onlookers of this little drama. The sole exceptions being Nabiki and Kimi. Hika scrambled to her feet. "Forgive?" She gasped. "What is there to forgive?" She demanded. HIka's stammer vanished in her shock. "I killed Ky." She said. "I would have killed you and anyone else in my way if you hadn't stopped me." She almost shouted. "What did you, what could you have done, that would require my forgiveness?" She asked in disbelief. "What?"</p><p>Kodachi smiled sadly. "The child Hika." She said. "You could have so easily had an abortion." She pointed out. "A child created by rape?" She said. "Even the hardest of hearts would not, could not, object." She said. "And I..."</p><p>"No." Hika shouted. She crossed her hands over her belly protectively. "It's mine." She exclaimed. "My child, mine." She said angrily.</p><p>"A child I forced you to accept." Kodachi reminded the pink haired woman. "As the price of my protection." She said. "No woman should be forced to do that."</p><p>"Shampoo not blame Hika if she decide not have child." Shampoo said quietly.</p><p>Hika made as if to protest then she stopped. Finally she shook her head. "Kasumi said I needed to find a way to re-re-redemption." She siad quietly. "Ma-maybe a re-real woman." Hika squeezed her fist. "Maybe a real woman." She repeated. "would have that choice." HIka looked at Kodachi and a sad smile came to her face. "What has been done cannot be undone." She said repeating Kodachi's words. She placed her hands over her slightly rounded belly. "But, maybe, with this child, I can go on." Kodachi smiled and nodded.</p><p>Shampoo rose to her feet and looked at Hika. For the first time in a long time the pink haired former hit man was able to meet Shampoo's eyes. Shampoo bowed. "Please forgive Shampoo." She said quietly. "Forgive Shampoo so she may go on too."</p><p>Hika looked at Shampoo for a long moment. "For Ky's sake." She said with a look toward Kodachi. She took a breath. "And maybe, for my own." HIka looked back at Shampoo. She nodded.</p><p>Shampoo bowed. "Thank you, Hika." She said.</p><p>"I will hold both of you to your words." Nabiki said into the silence that followed. "Now I think we had best go in to dinner." She said. "You know how Cook gets when dinner is...needlessly...delayed."</p><p>End Chapter 4</p><p>Author's Notes; Happy Holidays everyone. May the coming year bring you peace and prosperity.</p><p>Sarge climbs back on his long neglected soapbox.</p><p>Being a frequent commenter on a number of blog and news sites I have come to despair over the loss of civility in civil discourse. The Right calls the Left names and the Left calls the Right names. Now if it was just name calling it would be, barely, forgivable. But with the lack of civility as come a disregard for truth and facts. Heck, it seems that reality has become a casualty as well. It is not civil to call someone a LIEberal. It is not civil to call someone a Repukelican or Dumbocrat. It is not civil. It is not right and it should not be acceptable or accepted. So my New Year's resolution will be to be as civil as possible, to refrain from name calling, to cleave to the truth and to call out those who twist the truth or downright lie for political or social gain.</p><p>Won't you join me?</p>
