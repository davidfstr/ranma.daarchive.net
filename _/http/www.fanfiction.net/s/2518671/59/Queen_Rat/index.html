</div><p>Chapter 2</p><p>'Shadow War'</p><p>A thunderstorm broke just as Ranma, in female form, Akane and Ukyo were settling in for the evening when there was a hesitant knock on their bedroom door. "Yes?" Said Akane.</p><p>"It Pema." The door opened slightly and Pema stuck her head in. "I hope I not disturb." She said hesitantly. "But..."</p><p>"What's the matter, Pema?" Ranma asked. The door opened wider and Ranma could see Pema was clutching her blanket. "Can't sleep?" Pema shook her head. "I'm not surprised." Ranma patted the bed. "Come here."</p><p>"No, it okay, I sleep on floor." Pema protested.</p><p>"Uh, uh, Sugar." Ukyo disagreed. She scooted over to leave a space between her and Ranma. "Plenty of room." She pronounced. Ukyo patted the vacant spot. "Come on, it's okay."</p><p>Pema hesitantly approached the bed. "I not..." She began.</p><p>"We know, sugar." Ukyo said soothingly. "It's okay." She repeated. Ukyo got out of the bed and escorted Pema to it. "I hate being alone when it's thundering." She got the young girl into the bed and got in after. Pema found herself wedged, not uncomfortably, between Ukyo and Ranma. Akane reached across Ranma's body to pat Pema on the shoulder.</p><p>"I know I do." Akane said easily.</p><p>"Me too." Ranma said in agreement. "I used to get horrible nightmares when I slept alone."</p><p>"You were sleeping with Pops." Ukyo pointed out.</p><p>"Like I said, when I slept alone." Ranma grimaced. "Pops really wasn't any good with the comforting thing."</p><p>"Who...Pops?" Pema asked sleepily. The combination of the warmth of the bodies, the softness of the bed and the comforting presence of her 'gods', especially Ranma, made Pema relax. Pema knew down to her bones that she was safe.</p><p>"My dad." Ranma replied. "If you're really, really lucky you won't get to meet him for a long time."</p><p>Pema laughed sleepily. She yawned. "Excuse Pema." She mumbled. Her eyes closed slowly and in what seemed mere moments Pema was asleep.</p><p>Ranma leaned over and kissed Pema on the forehead. "Sleep well, little sister." Ranma said softly. "Thanks, guys." Ranma said quietly.</p><p>"For what?" Akane asked in the same quiet tones. "My sisters and I used to sleep together whenever there was a thunderstorm." She smiled and reached over to sweep a wayward lock of hair off of Pema's face. "Kind of nice having a baby sister."</p><p>"Yeah." Ukyo agreed. Ukyo leaned over. "Sleep well, little sister." She whispered.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Rei pushed open the door that led to the outer club. As she expected the imposing bulk of Botan Abe was waiting for her. "Hey Baby. Wanna date?" Rei greeted the bouncer. She giggled as Abe blushed. "Is that a yes?' She asked.</p><p>"Do-don't you have a date tonight?" Abe asked.</p><p>"He canceled." Rei said cheerfully. "Of course if you don't want..." Rei began.</p><p>"No!" Abe exclaimed. "I mean..." He stopped as Rei began to giggle. "I'll get the car." He said. "Better grab an umbrella, it's raining."</p><p>There was a muted crash of thunder as if to punctuate Abe's announcement. Rei clapped her hands over her ears. "Ow." Complained Rei. "That's loud." She waved a hand. "Get the car baby." She said. "I'll wait here." She said. Abe turned away. "Oh and baby." Rei said. Abe turned back. "Hurry." Rei ordered. Abe moved surprisingly fast for a man of his bulk. Rei watched him go with a fond smile on her face.</p><p>Abe reached the door leading out of the club and opened it. Abe stepped through. There was a sound like fire crackers and Abe staggered back into the club. One of Abe's hands went to his stomach while the other slammed the door closed. "Rei." Abe said in pain filled voice. He waved a hand toward the door to the inner club. "Get the girls. We got trouble." Abe hissed in pain.</p><p>"Abe, what?" Began Rei. The door shuddered as something impacted against it from outside. Rei pulled opened the door to the inner club. "Abe's hurt." Rei yelled.</p><p>Fumie and Miki looked up from their station at Rei's shout. "You go check. I'll call the girls." Miki ordered. She reached under the station and pulled out a baseball bat and a case. "Take these."</p><p>Fumie grabbed the bat and case and raced toward the outer club. She ran into the outer club to see Abe sitting against the door and Rei kneeling next to him. She was trying to look under Abe's big paw like hand.</p><p>"Let me see it." Rei ordered.</p><p>"I got the kit." Fumie placed the case next to Rei. "What we got?" She asked.</p><p>"Let me see it." Rei ordered again. "Someone shot Abe." She said. "Look, how am I supposed to do anything if you keep your hand in the way?" She said to Abe. Rei reached into the case and pulled out a roll of gauze. "Sounded like the door took a few hits as well."</p><p>"But Rei." Protested Abe.</p><p>"Stop being a baby." Rei said. "I gotta stop the bleeding." She said. "Call the doc." She said the Fumie. "Oh stop it." She said to Abe.</p><p>"But it hurts." Complained Abe. He lifted his hand. Rei quickly placed the gauze over it. Abe lowered his hand to hold it in place. He blew out a breath. "I'll live."</p><p>"Of course you will baby." Rei said proudly. "It's going to take more than one little bullet to stop my Honey Bear." She leaned against Abe comfortingly.</p><p>"Doc'll be here in ten minutes." Fumie reported. Fumi raised the cellphone again. "It's Fumie, Ms. Kuno."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Yuki lifted her head sleepily from the surprisingly comfortable chest of Genji Morimoto. She looked around to see what woke her. Her sleepy senses finally recognized her cell phone buzzing quietly on the nightstand. "Hello?" She said muzzily. Suddenly Yuki sat upright and the covers dropped away to reveal her naked chest. "say that again." Yuki's mouth dropped open. "As soon as we can." She replied to an unheard question. She hung up. "Makoto." She said urgently. "Wake up." Yuki got out of the bed. "Wake up." She said in a louder tone.</p><p>"Huh, what?" Makoto mumbled. She opened her eyes to see Yuki rummaging through her suitcase. "Yuki, what's going on?"</p><p>"Someone shot Abe." Yuki replied shortly.</p><p>Makoto looked down at the now awake Genji Morimoto. "Sorry Genji baby, but..." She leaned down and kissed the older man hungrily. "That should keep you until we get back." She said in forced amusement. Her amusement quickly faded. "We have to go."</p><p>"The bouncer? The fat guy?" Genji demanded. He got out of the bed as well.</p><p>"The bouncer." Yuki replied. "He may be fat and he may be a guy but he's one of Ms. Kuno's people."</p><p>"Besides he's Rei's man." Makoto added as she shimmied her long body into a form fitting black cat suit. A cat suit that matched the one the Yuki already had on. The only color on the suits was the applique white angel wings on the back. Yuki was placing a feathered mask over her face,</p><p>Genji walked over to Makoto. He waved a hand to indicate the outfits Makoto and Yuki were now wearing. "Somehow I don't think those are party outfits." He said.</p><p>"Well you see Genji honey." Makoto began. Shei twiddled her fingers. "You know those stories in the tabloids," Makoto licked her lower lip. "You know the ones about the 'Fallen Angels'?" She squeaked. She reached into her bag and pulled out another mask.</p><p>"You?" Genji asked in disbelief.</p><p>Makoto nodded nervously. "Don't be mad, Genji." She pleaded.</p><p>Genji walked over to his desk and picked up the telephone. He looked at the clock on the desk before dialing. "Takashima? It's Morimoto. I don't care what time it is. We have a problem." He nodded. "Yeah, that kind of problem."</p><p>"Genji honey? What are you doing?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"Helping." He said. "Where are we going?" He asked Makoto.</p><p>"We?" Yuki asked in surprise.</p><p>"We." Genji said firmly. "Where?" He demanded.</p><p>"The club." Yuki replied in response to the sudden tone of authority. A tone that didn't allow refusal.</p><p>"Kuno's club." He said into the phone. "As soon as possible." He hung up the phone and immediately dialed another number. "Bring the roadster." He said shortly and disconnected. Genji walked over to his closet and began dressing.</p><p>"Genji?" Makoto and Yuki exchanged looks. Yuki gave a confused shrug. "Genji honey, what are you doing?" Makoto asked again.</p><p>"I told you, helping." Genji emerged from the walk-in closet dressed in black slacks and black shirt. "And if you think I'm going to have you run off, either of you, into who knows what, without me there. You have another think coming."</p><p>"But Genji." Makoto pleaded. "You could get hurt."</p><p>"So could you." Genji pointed out. "That's why I'm going." He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. "By the time we get to the club, there will be twenty of my boys waiting."</p><p>"What?" Squeaked Yuki. She grabbed the cellphone and quickly punched in a number. "Ms. Mata?" She said. "It's Yuki." She looked at Genji and shook her head. "Genji is sending reinforcements." She almost shouted. "Yes Genji. Twenty men." She looked at Genji. "They used to fighting?"</p><p>Genji snorted. "It's not fighting that they're not used to." He said as he grabbed a leather jacket and shrugged it on. "But they're also the best damn truckers on the planet." He said proudly.</p><p>"Sounds like they can fight." Yuki reported over the phone. She nodded. "I will." She said in response to an unheard comment. "I will." She said again. "Thank you, Ms. Mata." Yuki disconnected. "Ms. Kuno sends her thanks, Genji." She said. "She also wishes me to explain what you are getting into." She added. "You may wish to reconsider your offer of help."</p><p>"Doubtful." Genji replied.</p><p>"We believe Abe was shot by agents of Tokio Wasahara." Yuki began.</p><p>"I told you about him, Genji." Makoto sad helpfully. "He's the slimy one."</p><p>Genji nodded. "Go on." He said to Yuki.</p><p>Yuki nodded. "The Ice Queen strongly suspects Tokio Wasahara of human trafficking. Girls." Yuki's face showed her anger.</p><p>"How old?" Genji's voice became a quiet growl.</p><p>"The youngest we know of is thirteen." Yuki looked at Makoto. "We need to go."</p><p>"I'll drive." Genji said firmly. He walked out of the apartment. A penthouse. Genji Morimoto was wealthy. Mostly self made, he had inherited a trucking business that his father had created. Six Trucks. Thirty years later, Genji Morimoto had turned six trucks into an international transport company that besides trucks, had planes, ships, warehouses and a packing plant. Most of those thirty years had been spent as much behind a wheel as behind a desk. He had worked hard and dealt harder. Never married, never having time to get married, Makoto was his reward to himself.</p><p>"And you're the Ice Queen's response?" Genji shook his head as he walked. "No offense, ladies, but you don't seem much of a thr..." Genji stopped in mid word as a knives suddenly fanned from Makoto's gloved hands. Genji looked at the knives and then at Makoto. He chuckled. "So my sweet little Makoto isn't so sweet after all." He said.</p><p>Makoto looked down shamefacedly. The knives disappeared back into their hidden sheaths. "I didn't want to upset you." Makoto said in a tiny voice. "You know how delicate your stomach is."</p><p>Genji chuckled again. "Somehow I don't think I'm going to worry about heartburn." He shook his head. They entered an elevator. Genji pressed the button for the garage. "Didn't want to upset me, huh?" He asked. Makoto shook her head. "We're going to have a talk when we get back."</p><p>"Yes Genji." Makoto said meekly.</p><p>"And you." Genji said. "What's your story?"</p><p>"I was trained to be one of Ms. Kuno's bodyguards. I'm good at what I do." Yuki leaned against the side of the elevator. "You're taking this well." She commented. "You don't look concerned about going into a fight."</p><p>"Oh come on Yuki." Makoto said. "It's Genji. Genji isn't afraid of anything." She declared. "You should know that by now." She scolded Yuki. She turned to Genji. "She didn't mean it baby." She laid a hand on Genji's shoulder. "I'll make her apologize later, okay?" She looked at Yuki. "Bad girl." She looked back at Genji. "Wont that be fun?"</p><p>"Been talking to Akane again." Muttered Yuki.</p><p>Genji chuckled as the elevator stopped and opened. "Okay." He said. "If it makes you happy." He smiled. "You know I like to make you happy." Makoto squealed happily. They walked out of the elevator and into the garage. There was a sportscar waiting and already started up. A stocky man stood next to the car. "Hey Ito."</p><p>"Mr. Morimoto." Ito replied. "Are you going to a costume party?" He said.</p><p>"Something like that." Genji replied. "Get in." He said to Makoto and Yuki. He started the car and soon they were driving along the streets and toward the club. "Fallen Angels, huh?" Genji shook his head. "And you plan on taking on Tokio Wasahara, who, if Makoto is to be believed, is the head of the largest group that make up the Tendo Yakusa."</p><p>"Makoto!" Yuki exclaimed. "You told him that?"</p><p>"Well of course I did." Makoto replied. "I tell Genji everything." She blushed. "Well except for being one of the Angels." She leaned her head on Genji's shoulder as he drove the sports car. "It's not just us, Genji." Makoto said. "Remember that fight in Odori Park?" She asked. "Well that was the Terrible Three." She explained. "And you know that street fighter everyone is talking about?"</p><p>"The one with the tranny girlfriend?" Genji chuckled. "Or is that boyfriend?"</p><p>"His name's Ryoga. In Konatsu's case, girlfriend is probably more appropriate." Yuki added from the back seat. "He's also sleeping with Ting Li."</p><p>"The model? The boy gets around." Genji shook his head. "So?"</p><p>"Both Ting Li and Konatsu are also accomplished martial artists." Yuki said in a reporting tone. "Very accomplished." Yuki leaned forward and placed a hand on Genji's other shoulder. "They're really very, very good." She said. "The point is, don't underestimate the assets the Ice Queen has at her disposal."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma, still in female form, woke to the insistent sound of a telephone. She looked at the clock. It was after three in the morning. "I got it." She heard Akane grumble sleepily. Ranma felt the weight of someone cuddled against her breast. She looked down and suppressed a chuckle. Pema was sleeping peacefully against her with her thumb in her mouth. Ranma's amusement faded at Akane's muffled exclamation. "Tomboy?" She asked quietly so as not to wake Pema.</p><p>"It's started." Akane said. She walked around the bed. "Uk-chan, wake up." She said quietly.</p><p>"Huh? Wazzup?" Mumbled Ukyo.</p><p>"It's started." Akane repeated. "We have to go."</p><p>Ukyo blinked in puzzlement for a moment then her eyes widened and she got out of the bed. "I'll make some tea." She mumbled. Ukyo threw a robe on and headed out of the bedroom.</p><p>Ranma looked down at the sleeping Pema. "What do we do about Pema?" She asked.</p><p>Pema took that moment to waken. It took her a moment to remember where she was. Her eyes widened and she hurriedly pulled her thumb out of her mouth. "Excuse." She mumbled. She sat up and wiped the sleep from her eyes. Pema looked around to see Akane getting dressed. Pema looked at the clock then looked at Ranma. "Ranma?"</p><p>"Sorry to wake you, little sister." Ranma said. "But we have to go out." She reluctantly got out of the bed. "And we don't want to leave you alone."</p><p>Pema looked at Akane again. "Ahh, you go fight demons, yes?" Pema nodded and jumped out of bed. "Pema go with you." She shoved her feet into her slippers. "We have time for tea?" She asked.</p><p>"No, Pema, wait." Ranma shook her head and sighed. "Ukyo's already making tea, why don't you go help her." Ranma said. Pema nodded cheerfully and ran out. "You'd think she'd want to stay here, where it's safe." Ranma grumbled to Akane.</p><p>"She probably thinks being with you is the safest place to be." Akane replied. She walked over to Ranma and wrapped her arms around the redhead's waist. "You have to admit, she has good reason to think that." She nodded toward the bedroom door. "Uk-chan does too." She said. "Why else would she have crawled into the prison after she was shot?"</p><p>"But..." Began Ranma. Akane placed a hand over Ranma's mouth.</p><p>"I feel the same way." Akane said quietly. "Besides, isn't it likely that they know where she's been living by now?" Akane asked. "Just because Yoshi stopped them the first time, doesn't mean they've given up." Ranma nodded reluctantly. "At least this way, they'll have to go through us to get to her." Akane added. "Right?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Right." Ranma looked into Akane's brown eyes. "Thanks Tomboy." She said. Suddenly Ranma grinned. "So, steak or sushi?"</p><p>"Darn, you would ask the hard questions." Akane grinned back. "Tell you what, why don't we let Pema decide?" She said. "Two to one she picks the male Ranma."</p><p>"Sounds like a sucker bet." Ranma grumped. Then the redhead smiled. "Oh hell, either way, I win." She said. "You're on."</p><p>End Chapter 2</p>
