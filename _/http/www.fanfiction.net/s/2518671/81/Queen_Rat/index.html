</div><p>Queen Rat Book 9</p><p>Shifting Loyalties</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>'Queen's Gambit'</p><p>The Purple Cat Lounge was to outward appearances a restaurant. A very popular and successful one at that. It was but it was also the home and headquarters to one of the more powerful members of the Tendo Yakusa, Shampoo of the Joketsuzoku. In her mid twenties she was still the same Chinese beauty that had come to Nerima ten years earlier. Of course she was no longer in Nerima. That ward was, while not exactly forbidden to her, not a place she was welcome. Not without an invitation anyway. Instead she had been...given Kita ward, as her territory, by the Ice Queen, and Shampoo had subsequently opened the Purple Cat Lounge. Like Ky's Cafe, the Purple Cat Lounge was a combination restaurant/club. Though her gaming tables were on the second floor and her girls took their clients to rooms on the third floor. Shampoo's own quarters was the entire fourth floor. Shampoo's office was in the back of the club on the Second floor, though she spent a good part of her time in the club itself.</p><p>Shampoo would never admit it but she was both impressed with and terrified of the Ice Queen and her Cold Handmaiden, Kimi Ota. In five short years, Nabiki Tendo and Kimi Ota had, together, successfully carved out one of the largest Yakusa territories in Tokyo, if not all of Japan. An achievement that was made all the more impressive by virtue of also having thwarted Cologne's own attempts to do something similar through Hikaru Nakamura. Ranma and his allies may have been the muscle but Nabiki and Kimi were the brains.</p><p>It was Nabiki and Kimi's actions that finally forced Cologne to admit defeat and accept what the Ice Queen offered; a piece of Tokyo's black market, some local influence and a child for Shampoo by Ranma Saotome, in exchange for acknowledging Nabiki as Oyabun and adherence to all of Nabiki's rules.</p><p>While Cologne grudgingly accepted Nabiki as Oyabun, it was Shampoo who was required to follow the rules set down. And while Cologne continued to scheme, something had changed in Shampoo. She no longer wanted what Cologne wanted. Now she had her own goals.</p><p>Shampoo looked at the calendar again and nodded. "Three weeks." She said almost to herself. "I must tell Great grandmother." She said in reluctant decision. Shampoo looked at the calendar again. "But first, I tell...her."</p><p>Shampoo carefully and deliberately dressed herself in a conservative black business suit then walked downstairs of the building that housed the Purple Cat Lounge and into her office. Two Chinese women, Joketsuzoku, stood on either side of the office door. They nodded as Shampoo walked into her office. Shampoo sat down at her desk and, with a deep breath, picked up her telephone and dialed a number. She smiled sourly as the phone was answered. "Hello Mountain Girl." She said. "May I speak to Akane Tendo?"</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Shampoo stepped out of the rear of the limosine. "I do not know how long I will be." She said to the female driver. The driver, also Chinese, nodded. Shampoo looked at the building in front of her. She hid a meloncholy sigh and walked to the entrance. It wasn't an overly large building, only five stories, but it was well maintained and well appointed, and in the heart of a more upscale section of Itabashi. Shampoo had been to this apartment a number of times over the past three months. And despite why she had been to this apartment, she couldn't honestly call her visits pleasant. 'Akane Tendo was right.' She thought moodily though she kept a pleasant expression on her face. 'I am a whore.' Her expression changed slightly to one that reflected a touch of satisfaction. 'At least I'm Ranma's whore.' She pressed a call button. "Yes?" Said a familiar voice. "It Shampoo." Shampoo replied. The door buzzed and unlocked. Shampoo opened the door and walked through a small, though well decorated lounge, and to an elevator. Shampoo entered the elevator and took it to the top floor. 'Now comes the hard part.' She thought when the elevator came to a stop and the doors opened.</p><p>As she exited the elevator a door opened at the end of the hall and a familiar pair stood in the doorway with their arms crossed. This time Shampoo did not hide her sigh. She walked to the door and bowed nearly in half.</p><p>Pema Tenzin looked at the bowed form of Shampoo with great satisfaction. It was an unspoken condition imposed on Shampoo. One that Pema knew grated on the Joketsuzoku. Not that Pema was happy with Shampoo having 'access' to Ranma but Pema knew and accepted the reason behind it. Still having Shampoo virtually prostrating herself in front of her and Kagomi every time she visited was almost worth it. "Akane say you have news, Joketsuzoku."</p><p>"Yes, Mountain Girl." Shampoo replied still bowed over. "I carry Ranma's child."</p><p>"That's what we figured." The other woman, Kagomi Akahito commented."Well, I suppose you should come in and tell Ranma yourself."</p><p>Shampoo straightened and gave Kagomi a nod though she didn't speak directly to Kagomi. A second unspoken condition, Shampoo did not speak directly to Kagomi or use either Kagomi or Pema's names, though she took pains to be as polite as possible. Shampoo entered the apartment and followed Pema and Kagomi into the main room.</p><p>"Going to a funeral, Shampoo?" Akane asked. She and Ukyo were both pouring over a red bound book with great interest, but she had looked up when Shampoo entered. "Bit somber for you." She said indicating the black business outfit Shampoo was wearing.</p><p>Shampoo shrugged. "Maybe." She replied. "Maybe mine."</p><p>Akane raised an eyebrow and walked over to Shampoo. "Explain." She ordered. "If you're pregnant, then .."</p><p>"I pregnant." Shampoo interrupted. "That not what Shampoo mean." She said. "Shampoo need Ranma child to reclaim honor, yes." She said. "But Shampoo no longer want go home." She said. "Shampoo no expect Akane Tendo to like Shampoo..."</p><p>"Good, cause I don't." Akane said.</p><p>Shampoo nodded. "Akane Tendo have good reason." She admitted. "But, now that Shampoo have Ranma child, Shampoo free." She said. "So Shampoo say, she no longer want go home."</p><p>"What does Cologne say about that?" Ukyo asked in interested tones.</p><p>"Shampoo no yet tell Great Grandmother." Shampoo said. "Shampoo decide that frst night, she no longer Great Grandmother's whore."</p><p>"You still whore." Pema said from behind Shampoo.</p><p>"Yes, Mountain Girl, Shampoo whore." Shampoo admitted without turning around. "Just not Great Grandmother's whore."</p><p>"I doubt Cologne is going...Oh." Ukyo said in realization. "You're treading on dangerous ground, Shampoo." Ukyo warned. She stopped as Shampoo nodded. "What do you want, Shampoo?"</p><p>"Protection." Shampoo said bluntly. "Ice Queen say, all whores under her protection." She said "As Mountain Girl say, Shampoo whore." She said. "Ranma's whore." She smiled slightly.. "All Shampoo want is Ranma say it true." She looked around. "Where Ranma anyway?"</p><p>"Ranma's on the roof, training." Akane replied. "Pema, why don't you and Kagomi get Ranma." She said.</p><p>Ukyo stood. "I'll make tea." She declared. "I have a feeling, we're going to be here for awhile."</p><p>In moments the only people in the main room were Akane and Shampoo. "Okay Shampoo, what's really going on?" Akane asked. "And don't give me this protection shit." She said. "You don't need Ranma to get Nabiki's protection."</p><p>"No, Shampoo need Ranma to protect me from Great Grandmother." Shampoo replied. She sat down where Akane and Ukyo had been sitting and idly started leafing through the red bound book. "If Ranma claim Shampoo as...his, then Great Grandmother be less likely do something... drastic." Shampoo frowned at the book. "Where Ranma get this?" She asked suddenly. "This old knowledge."</p><p>"You're probably one of the few people who'd believe us if we told you." Ranma's sad as he came into the room with Pema and Kagomi. "Hello Shampoo." He said cooly.</p><p>Shampoo smiled briefly. "Ranma." She replied. "I have news, Ranma." She said. "I bear your child."</p><p>"She doesn't want to go home, Ranma." Akane cut in. "She's..." Akane paused. "What are you doing, Shampoo?"</p><p>Shampoo smiled. "Territory that Ice Queen give..." She tapped her chest. "She give me." She said. "I earn that territory." She said. "On my back, like good whore." She said fiercely. "It mine." She declared. "Not great grandmother's...mine."</p><p>"She's not going to like that." Ranma said in understanding.</p><p>"It mine, Ranma." Shampoo said in near pleading tones. "Shampoo follow Ice Queen rules, yes? Shampoo work hard." She pointed out. "Goods move, people work, girls happy." She said. "Much money made, yes?" She said. "It mine, Ranma."</p><p>"Ranma?" Pema said softly.</p><p>"Yeah, Punkin?" Ranma replied.</p><p>Instead of answering, Pema walked over to Shampoo. "You a bitch." She said. "And you whore." She continued. Pema nodded sharply. "I no like you." She said. "No think I ever like you." Shampoo smiled wryly and nodded in return. Pema smiled back. "But you Ranma's woman." She said. "Ranma always treat his womans right." She said. "Is that not right, Ranma?"</p><p>Ranma snorted. "Somehow I knew you were going to say that." He said in amusement. "Tomboy?"</p><p>Akane grinned. "Well, you do." She said in acknowledgment. Akane gave Shampoo a questioning look. "How hard do you think the Old Ghoul is going to...disagree?" She asked. "She's not going to risk the baby." She said.</p><p>"No." Agreed Shampoo. "But that don't mean she be nice."</p><p>"She's got a point, Ran-chan." Ukyo said as she walked into the room. She was holding a tray that Kagomi immediatly walked over and took. Kagomi carried the tray to the table, knelt down and poured tea. Ukyo nodded in approval. Kagomi made sure that everyone, starting with Ranma, was served tea.</p><p>"Yeah, I know." Ranma said. "I know Nabs will back you." Ranma said. "But she doesn't want a war." He shook his head. "Yet I don't see how we can avoid one."</p><p>"Probably not." Agreed Akane. She idly raised a hand and concentrated. Suddenly a flame ignited in the middle of her palm. Just as suddenly it was extinguished. Akane snorted in amusement. "On the other hand, it has been boring recently." She smiled coldly at Shampoo. "Fifteen percent."</p><p>"Shampoo thought Akane Tendo not like Shampoo." Shampoo said in amusement. "Fifteen percent very fair."</p><p>"I don't like you, Shampoo." Akane replied in agreement. "But since you've been playing by the rules, so will we." She said.</p><p>"Like you said, your girls are happy." Ukyo added. "That counts a lot in our book." She smiled slightly. "We don't like you, probably never will." She said. "And if we find out you're fucking with us..."She said in threatening tones.</p><p>"Shampoo understand." She said. She stood. "Shampoo think it good idea she leave now." She bowed nearly in half. "Oh, almost forgot." She said. "Hika." She raised a hand to forestall any comments. "Great grandmother still want child." She said. "It, what word, oh yes, leverage." She bowed again. "Shampoo thank you." She said.</p><p>"Walk her to the door, Punkin." Ranma said to Pema. Pema nodded and she and Kagomi escorted Shampoo to the door. Ranma waited until Pema and Kagomi returned. "Well?" He said.</p><p>"Almost forgot, my ass." Akane said. "That was the real reason she came here."</p><p>"She as much as told us that the Old Ghoul is going to try to find and...retrieve Hikaru." Ukyo said. "And just as much told us that as long as we have Hikaru...and the child, that she's going to be cautious."</p><p>"Tomboy?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Akane nodded. "Which means, I think, that once the child is born, Hikaru is toast." Her expression turned sour. "Which also means, Shampoo is under the same threat."</p><p>"Is that why bitch wear black?" Pema asked.</p><p>"If the Tomboy is right, which I think she is, then yes." Ranma replied. "The Joketsuzoku have been running a breeding program for a long time." He smiled sourly. "Now that I think of it, now that Shampoo is pregnant, I'm pretty much expendable as well."</p><p>"Once the baby is born." Ukyo agreed. "So the earliest Cologne would go after Hikaru is about five months from now, and Shampoo and Ran-chan, in about eight months or so." Ukyo blew out an annoyed breath. "Nabs is not going to like this." She predicted.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"They're right." Nabiki, Lady Kuno said. "I don't like it." She leaned back in her leather chair and closed her eyes. "Not that I'm surprised." She said without opening her eyes. "Shampoo has been doing most of the work for some time now."</p><p>"Maybe Nabs." Kimo Ota, the Lady Kimi, replied doubtfully. "But pimps don't like losing a good whore." She smiled slightly. "Goes double for Madams." She said. "What I don't understand, is why now?"</p><p>Nabiki leaned forward and opened her eyes. "There's a lot about the Joketsuzoku that's hard to understand." Nabiki replied. She leaned back in her chair again and folded her palms over her flat stomach. "And some that's pretty damn easy." She said in slightly sour tones. "Cologne's actions aren't all that different from a certain fat chef we know." She said. "My guess is that Shampoo just got tired of being a good little Joketsuzoku girl."</p><p>"Ranma's that good a lover?" Kimi asked in amused tones.</p><p>"More like my sister is that good a martial artist." Nabiki replied. "Joketsuzoku law requires that Shampoo kill Akane but..." Nabiki shrugged. "I think Shampoo is rethinking her strategy." She leaned back and closed her eyes again. "I think Shampoo is rethinking a whole lot of things." She smiled without opening her eyes. "She may be a homicidal bitch, but I think she's getting tired of being a lonely, homicidal bitch."</p><p>"And the potential threats against Hikaru, Shampoo and Ranma?" Kimi asked. She picked up a glass of water and took a sip.</p><p>"That's more difficult." Nabiki replied. "And pretty much depends on how successful Shampoo is in getting and keeping control of her territory." Nabiki pursed her lips thoughtfully. "If Shampoo does succeed then I think we can convince Cologne that it's in her best interests to...play nice."</p><p>"So, we let it play out for now?" Kimi suggested more than asked.</p><p>"We let it play out for now." Agreed Nabiki. Nabiki opened her eyes and sat up. "Well, I'm not going to get anymore work done today." She declared. "Feel like taking a walk?"</p><p>Kimi snorted in amusement. "You just want to show off."</p><p>"No, I want to be waited on hand and foot." Nabiki replied. "And to watch Cook run himself ragged."</p><p>Kimi laughed. "Now that sounds like fun." She agreed. Kimi stood, walked over to Nabiki and pulled her friend and partner to her feet. The two women strolled arm and arm out of Nabiki's private office. "Where to first?' She asked. The sound of hurrying feet made the two women turn. One of the Kuno family retainers was approaching quickly.</p><p>"My Ladies." The retainer said breathlessly. "Are you in need of something?"</p><p>"Just taking a walk." Nabiki said with a slight smile.</p><p>"Alone?" The retainer said in horror.</p><p>"I think we're quite safe in the mansion." Nabiki replied.</p><p>"Well yes, of course." Replied the retainer. "But..." The retainer stopped. "Please permit me to escort you."</p><p>"We're only going to the veranda." Nabiki said in amused tones. Her smile widened as the retainer lifted his wrist. The retainer like all Kuno retainers were 'wired' and could communicate with each other. The retainer spoke briefly. Nabiki and Kimi exchanged looks and resumed their stroll down the hallway.</p><p>"The weather is turning chilly, My Ladies." The retainer said as he followed. "I'll have someone bring you both a shawl."</p><p>"And some coffee." Kimi said.</p><p>"Sorry, My lady." The retainer said apologetically. "But Dr. Ono has prohibited that particular beverage." He said. "He has, however, approved green tea."</p><p>"It was worth a try." Kimi said in slightly sour tones. "Oh well, green tea it is."</p><p>"Yes, My Lady." The retainer said smoothly. "Cook wishes to know if you are hungry." He continued.</p><p>Nabiki and Kimi looked at each other with smiles. "You know, I've been having this terrible craving for a caviar and truffle omelet." She looked at the retainer. "That is on the approved foods list, I presume."</p><p>"Yes My Lady." The retainer replied.</p><p>"I think I'd like one as well." Kimi said cheerfully.</p><p>"Very good My Lady." He raised his wrist and murmured into it. "Your meal will be ready shortly." He smiled in relief as the two women continued walking. He later smiled in approval when two female Kuno retainers were waiting at the doors to the veranda with silk cloaks. Cloaks they helped Nabiki and Kimi put on. 'Two heirs.' He thought in satisfaction. 'Hopefully at least one will be male.'</p><p>In another part of the mansion, the training salon, Kodachi Kuno and her adopted daughter, Kiko Kuno were going through a rhythmic dance routine together. Though it was a dance routine that would never be performed for an audience. Not a willing one, anyway. Kodachi pulled out her ribbon and used it to snag a post that jutted out of the wall and high above the ground. With the ease of the acrobat that she was, she used the ribbon to launch herself high into the air. Kiko quickly followed. Back and forth they swung across the salon in an elaborate game af tag, Their laughter rang loud in the salon.</p><p>Noriko Mata, Kodachi Kuno's friend and companion, watched the antics of Kodachi and Kiko with a huge smile on her face. "Gods it's good to hear her laugh.' She thought in approval. "You were getting too serious again, Dachi." She said quietly.</p><p>Noriko continued through her own exercises. While she would never achieve the level of athleticism demonstrated by either Kodachi or her protege, Kiko, she was determined to push herself to her limits. An attitude that was matched by the other, though currently not present, members of Kodachi's inner circle. This was mostly due to the efforts of Noriko as she had decided that Kodachi and Kiko needed some 'Mother and Daughter' time. The rest of the Fallen Angels would be at the mansion over the weekend.</p><p>Noriko stopped as one of the Kuno retainers, one of Kodachi's personal retainers, approached. Noriko grabbed a towel and a bottle of water and intercepted the retainer. "Is there a problem?" Noriko asked while pointedly blocking the retainer from continuing.</p><p>The woman paused and bowed. "Forgive me, Ms. Mata." The retainer replied. "But...it's her." She said. "And..."</p><p>"Tell me what's going on." Noriko replied. "I'd prefer not to interrupt Ms. Kuno, if at all possible."</p><p>"Of course not, Ms. Mata." The retainer replied. "I meant no disrespect." She said. "She's...she tried again." She said. "Fortunately her room is monitored and we were able to prevent her from truly harmng herself."</p><p>Noriko nodded in understanding. "If you haven't already, call Dr. Ono." She replied briskly. "And then see if Auntie will speak to her."</p><p>"Dr. Ono is on his way." The retainer replied. "I hadn't wanted to presume about Mrs. Saotome." She said. "Which is why I came to see My Lady..."</p><p>"Ah, I understand." Noriko interrupted. "I will call Auntie."</p><p>"Thank you, Ms. Mata." The retainer said in some relief. She bowed and walked away. Noriko watched her go then retrieved her cell phone. "Auntie?" She said when the phone was answered. She looked over to where Kodachi and Kiko had taken their game to a pair of pommel horses. Noriko smiled. "They're playing, Auntie." She said. "Auntie, the reason I called." She said. "Yes, Auntie...it's Hikaru." She nodded as she listened. "Could you?" She asked in mild but somewhat plaintive tones."I'll have a...oh that's right, Abe will drive you."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Genma." Yelled Nodoka as she arranged a silk scarf over a simple and conservative but expensive two piece outfit in shades of red and maroon. She waited until Genma walked into her room. While still living together and married Genma maintained a separate bedroom in the home. It was not a hardship for either of them. "I need to go to the mansion." She said.</p><p>"It's that boy again." Genma said disapprovingly.</p><p>"That boy, as you call her." Nodoka said pointedly. "Is almost five months along." She said. "And none of your business." She said tartly. "What is your business, is Suki." She said. "Don't roll your eyes at me, Genma Saotome."</p><p>"I don't see the problem." Genma said petulantly. "The club pays her."</p><p>"That's the problem, Genma." Nodoka replied sharply. "The club is paying." She said. "Crack open that wallet of yours and buy her something, anything, I don't care what it is, but use your own money for once." She said sternly. "She's a nice girl and..." The doorbell to the house rang. "That will be Abe." She said. "Now I may have to spend the night there so don't wait up."</p><p>"Yes, Nodoka." Genma grumped in reply. "Don't know why I have to buy her anything." He muttered.</p><p>"I'll make it easy for you, Genma." Nodoka said in falsely sweet tones. "Either buy her something, something nice, or you will find her...unavailable?"</p><p>"Yes, Nodoka." Genma replied in resigned tones.</p><p>"Good." Nodoka replied. She walked to the door and opened it. As she expected, the massive form of Botan Abe was waiting. "Good afternoon, Abe." She said in greeting. The big man bowed respectfully and escorted Nodoka to the waiting limo. He opened the passenger door and made sure Nodoka was settled before he got into the drivers seat and drove away.</p><p>Botan Abe drove his passenger carefully through the crowded streets of Nerima. Occasionally glancing in the rearview mirror to check on his passenger as well as the traffic behind him. Abe smiled slightly. "Lonely, Miss Nodoka?" He asked. "I'm sure I could stop and..."</p><p>Nodoka laughed quietly. "Thank you, Abe." She replied. "But not right now." Nodoka looked out of the window of the limo. "Maybe afterwards."</p><p>"Of course, Miss Nodoka." Abe replied smoothly. Abe hesitated a moment. "I know you're busy, Miss Nodoka, but.." Abe hesitated. "It's about Rei."</p><p>Nodoka turned her head. "Oh dear, I do hope you and Rei are all right." She said in concern. "Rei hasn't indicated that anything was wrong."</p><p>"We're fine, Miss Nodoka." Abe replied quickly.</p><p>Nodoka suppressed a laugh as a bright red flush appeared on the back of the big man's neck. "But...?" She asked.</p><p>"Well, it's just..." The big man began, then trailed off. "It's just..." Abe began again and again he trailed off.</p><p>"Why, Abe." Nodoka said with a slight laugh in her voice. "Are you getting jealous?" She smiled as the flush down the big man's neck deepened. "Well, I suppose I can understand that." She said. "Rei is a very lovely girl." She continued. "And very popular." She said. "For those that can afford her."</p><p>"That's the problem, Miss Nodoka." Abe replied in muted pained tones. "I'm just a bouncer and..."</p><p>"Ah." Nodoka said. "And you feel you can't afford to, um, have an exclusive contract?" She said in slightly teasing tones. "Have you spoken to Rei?" She asked. The big man shook his head. "Would you like me to?" She asked. Abe's flushed deepened even further. He nodded hesitantly. "Then I will." Nodoka said. "Oh, and Abe, I thought by now you'd realize you were not 'just a bouncer'." She said in slightly scolding tones. "Do you really think Ms. Kuno would entrust the safety of even the least of her girls to just a bouncer?" She said. "My dear Abe, even an an Angel needs a Guardian."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The pink haired woman lay curled up in fetal position in the middle of a single bed. Though the bed would be normally found in a hospital, it was actually in a small suite on the top floor of the Kuno mansion. A suite that had been converted for use as a medical facility. Originally Kodachi had intended to place the woman in one of several safe houses she had established for those working girls that, for one reason or another, needed protection from their pimps and in some cases, their husbands. She had later decided to move Hikaru here after her first suicide attempt.</p><p>Hikaru Nakamura was, despite appearances, once a man. Barely more than a year previously he had been a Yakusa hitman and was poised to take control of one of the largest and most powerful Yakusa families in Japan. Intelligent, ruthless and trained by Cologne of the Joketsuzoku there were few that could match him in battle. Yet, in the end, he had been not only matched but defeated. As punishment he had been cursed and locked in female form, imprisoned and forcibly impregnated by his former lover, if such a word is appropriate, Shampoo of the Joketsuzoku.</p><p>She had eventually escaped and here ended up here living in the home of the woman whose fiance she had murdered. As a man, Hikaru Nakamura was never prone to introspection, doubt or fear. Now, as a women, she found herself wracked by the very emotions she once scorned. And, as her pregnancy progressed, those emotions buffeted her fragile psyche harder and more insistently. The bandages Dr. Ono was wrapping around her wrists were mute testimony to the depths of her despair.</p><p>"Well the damage wasn't all that severe." Dr. Ono said reassuringly. "Kodachi's people did a very good job." He said to the silent Hikaru. "You'll be fine in no time." In response Hikaru rolled over and turned her back on Dr. Ono. Dr. Ono sighed. "Kasumi...?"</p><p>"I'll stay with her until Auntie arrives." Kasumi said calmly. She sat down on the edge of the bed and started gently rubbing the pink haired woman's back. Tofu Ono watched for a moment before exiting the room. Kasumi continued rubbing Hikaru's back, Kasumi, being Kasumi, maintained her silence and just rubbed Hikaru's back comfortingly.</p><p>"H-how do you st-st-stand it?" Hikaru said finally in a teary voice. "Knowing..."</p><p>"I was born a woman." Kasumi said simply. "I can't imagine what it must be like for you." She said in quiet sympathy. "I know you're frightened, but you can't keep trying to hurt yourself."</p><p>Hikaru wiped at her face. "Ev-every day, " She sniffed. "Every day I feel a little more of...of...of myself slipping away." She said. "Every,...every day." She sniffed again.</p><p>"Shh..shh." Kasumi said soothingly. Kasumi looked up as the door to the bedroom opened and Nodoka looked in. "Ah, Auntie is here." Kasumi stood but kept her hand pressed comfortingly against the small of Hikaru's back. "I must go." She said in gentle tones. HIkaru nodded without looking up. Kasumi walked to the door. "Thank you for coming, Auntie." She said quietly. "She's..."</p><p>"Don't worry dear." Nodoka said in her own quiet tones. "I can handle it from here." She gave Kasumi a short bow before walking over to the bed and taking Kasumi's place as she also began to rub the pink haired woman's back.</p><p>"I wish I was d-d-dead." Sniffed Hikaru.</p><p>"That's a foolish wish." Nodoka said sternly. "Ranma would never say such a foolish thing."</p><p>HIkaru rolled over and glared angrily at Nodoka. "Then I wish I could change places with that fa...with Ranma." She corrected herself at a warning glare from Nodoka.</p><p>"I suspect my son would grant that wish if he could." Nodoka said in mild amusement. She sobered quickly. "And have you considered the possibility that, once the child is born, you will return to your male form?"</p><p>Hikaru curled into a ball, almost tucking her head between her knees. She nodded. "I-I thought about it but... but what if I d-d-don't?" She said in despair. "And what d-d-does it m-matter?" She moaned. "I won't be, won't be...m-m-me."</p><p>"I've never heard such foolishness." Nodoka scolded. "Won't be you, indeed." She said dismissively. "Who else would you be?" She asked. "Who else could you be?" She put a stern expression on her face. "You will be Hikaru Nakamura."</p><p>"Hika." Corrected Hikaru mournfully. "Don't you understand?" She moaned. "I'm..I'm be-becoming...becoming Hika." She raised her head from between her knees. "I-I-I can feel it." She hissed in a pained whisper.</p><p>End Chapter 1</p><p>Author's Note: It's the Holiday Season again. Thought I'd give you an early present.</p>
