</div><p>Chapter 4</p><p>'Cold War'</p><p>Bored, now that Doctor Ono had finally left with Abe and Kasumi, Kiko and Pema left the outer club and walked into the inner club. "This is where mommy works." Kiko told Pema. She pointed to a door. "And that's Auntie Dachi's office." She told the Tibetan teenager.</p><p>"You visit Auntie and Momma here?" Pema asked in surprise. Innocent Pema may have been about most things she realized that this was a some kind of club. The bar and gaming tables were obvious even to her.</p><p>Kiko nodded. "Well once." She amended. "And only cause Auntie Dachi was really, really sad." She clarified. "Hey, wanna see something?" Without waiting for an answer, Kiko grabbed Pema's hand and pulled her along. They went to a door near the back. Kiko pressed a button. There was a hum and then the door clicked and opened. Kiko and Pema entered the elevator and Kiko pressed another button. The elevator rose.</p><p>"Where we go?" Pema asked.</p><p>"A place only for Auntie's special girls." Kiko said. The elevator stopped and the door opened. Kiko led Pema to a door at the end of the hall. She opened the door and they stepped inside. "Tahdah." Kiko said cheerfully. "We can stay here until everyone comes back." She said. Kiko sighed. "I can't wait until I'm older." She said. "Then I can come here all the time." She tapped herself on the chest. "I'm gonna be Auntie's number one girl when I grow up." She declared.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma couldn't help but be proud of Akane. The black haired girl was methodically demolishing the house as efficiently as a team of demolition experts. Only faster. He nodded in satisfaction as Ukyo kept close to Akane, both to cover her back and, when necessary, lend a hand. 'Good ole Uk-chan.' Ranma thought. 'Best buddy the Tomboy and I could ever have.' Ranma made a mental note to be extra nice to Ukyo. 'She must know by now I've chosen Akane.' Ranma realized. 'And it looks like she doesn't mind.'</p><p>Knowing both Akane and Ukyo were okay, Ranma turned his attention to the rest of the conflict. Ranma looked around. "Hey Pig-Boy, feel like sparring after this is over?" He called. "You're barely working up a sweat."</p><p>"No kidding." Ryoga called back. "This guys are lame." He shook his head. "Not today, maybe next week." He said conversationally as he continued tossing Yakusa thugs around like rag dolls. "I promised Ting Li and Konatsu a small vacation." He said. "Okay?"</p><p>"Sure, no problem." Ranma replied. Ranma looked around. "Well this is boring." He said to himself. "Ryoga doesn't need help, Akane doesn't need help." He looked off to where Kodachi was capturing Yakusa thugs with her ribbon and tossing them into the air. "And Kodachi certainly doesn't need any help." He strolled over to where Genji Morimoto was standing, flanked between two catsuited women. "You know, we could have just left this to you and your boys." Ranma said without preamble. "And the Angels."</p><p>"Well, Ms. Kuno certainly." Genji replied.</p><p>"Inu-Washi, Genji." Makoto scolded mildly.</p><p>"Inu-washi." Genji agreed with a chuckle. A muffled saxophone riff suddenly sounded from the vicinity of Ranma's belt. Ranma reached down and pulled out a cell phone. "Yeah?" He said. "Okay thanks." He closed the phone. "Tomboy. Uk-chan. Front and center." He yelled. Ukyo looked up and tapped Akane on the shoulder. She had to do it twice to get the black haired girl to stop smashing walls. Ukyo pointed over to Ranma. Akane nodded and the two women hurried over.</p><p>"What's up?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Tokio knows." Ranma held up the cell phone. Akane and Ukyo nodded. "Time to go." Ranma turned to Genji Morimoto. "Tell the gang it was fun and all, but we had to go." He waved a hand and sprinted away. Akane and Ukyo quickly caught up. There was a thunderclap just as the moved out of sight.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Kiko led Pema around the apartment. "And this the kitchen." Kiko opened the door. "Wanna soda?" Pema nodded. They entered the kitchen and stopped. There was an older woman and two young men sitting at the table, sipping tea. Which would have been fine, except that the woman was wearing a nearly transparent robe and the two young men were, apparently, naked. Only the fact that they were sitting and the angle of the table prevented Pema and Kiko from seeing more than they should have.</p><p>Nodoka looked up. "Oh dear." She exclaimed quietly. "Girls, close your eyes." Nodoka ordered. The two girls quickly obeyed. "Boys, get dressed." She said in regretful tones. There was a sound of chairs being pushed back. "You can open your eyes now." Nodoka said a minute later. Pema and Kiko opened their eyes. Nodoka was looking at them with a slightly puzzled look. "What are the two of you doing here?" She asked. She glanced at a wall clock. "And so early." Nodoka tilted her head. "You must be Pema."</p><p>Pema nodded her head nervously. "Gods bring me here, so I safe. They go fight demons."</p><p>"Gods, demons?" Nodoka asked. She smiled. "You think my son is a god?"</p><p>Pema nodded. Then her eyes widened in shock as Nodoka's words sank in. "You Ranma, mama?" She squeaked. Nodoka nodded. "Please forgive." Pema said hurriedly. Pema started bowing over and over.</p><p>"Child, stop." Nodoka ordered."Now  do you mean, fight demons?" She demanded.</p><p>"Demons who hurt Pema." Pema began.</p><p>"Mommy said they're going to get the bad men that hurt Abe." Kiko said at the same time.</p><p>"Abe?" Nodoka said sharply. "Abe is hurt?" Kiko nodded. "Boys!" Nodoka yelled.</p><p>Less than a minute later the kitchen door opened and Jiro stuck his head in. "Yes, Miss Nodoka?" Jiro asked.</p><p>"Someone hurt Abe." Nodoka said. She looked at Kiko. "How?"</p><p>"Mommy said someone shot him, Auntie." Kiko replied.</p><p>Jiro nodded. "I'll tell Daisuke." He said. Jiro smiled reassuringly. He pulled his head out and closed the door.</p><p>Nodoka smiled slightly. "That's my boys." She murmured. She looked at Kiko and Pema. "Tea?"</p><p>"I make, Lady...No-Nodoka?" Pema stopped.</p><p>"Call me Auntie." Nodoka replied. "Everyone else does." She smiled. "Sit." She ordered the two girls. "I'll make the tea." She said. Nodoka raised an admonishing finger. "Sit." She said to Pema. The two girls sat down, though Pema was obviously nervous. Nodoka stood and walked to the counter. "so," Nodoka's tone was amused. "You think of my son as a god."</p><p>"He is a god." Pema declared in an indignant tone. "He strong as god, as beautiful as god, he...he fly." She declared. "Mortal man not do what Ranma do." She frowned as Nodoka chuckled. "Pema not care you no think he god, Pema know."</p><p>"I'm not laughing at you, dear." Nodoka said in reassurance. "It's a rare mother who doesn't think her child is special." She brought a tea service to the table and poured tea for the two young girls. "Though even I would draw the line at 'god'." She smiled. "He is strong, isn't he?" She said proudly.</p><p>Pema nodded firmly. "And beautiful." Pema sighed. "Too beautiful for Pema." She said quietly. "Only Akane and Ukyo beautiful enough." Pema sighed again. "Only Akane and Ukyo strong enough." Pema suddenly clapped her hands over Kiko's ears.</p><p>"Hey." Complained Kiko.</p><p>"He very, very big. Akane, Ukyo need be strong." Pema confided. Pema took her hands away from Kiko's ears. "You too young." She explained to Kiko.</p><p>"So are you." Nodoka observed though she was smiling very widely as she said it. "So, you're in love with my son, too." She said. Pema blushed. "I thought so." Nodoka commented.</p><p>"Ranma think of Pema as little sister." Pema said in regretful tones. "At least he let Pema stay. It enough for Pema."</p><p>"You're too young for him, dear." Nodoka said with a gentle smile. She refilled the two girl's cups. "Now, while we're waiting, why don't we play a game?" She said cheerfully.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Tokio Wasuhara listened griimly as his lieutenant gave his report. "Nothing?" He growled.</p><p>"Nothing, Boss." His Lieutenant replied nervously. "Just a pile of rubble. No booze, no drugs, no girls, nothing. Just a pile of rubble." The man wiped his forehead with his sleeve. "Boss," The man stopped and then pulled a folded piece of paper from his jacket pocket. "I found this on the gate. It's...it's addressed to you." He offered the paper to the Yakusa Lord. The man took a step back as soon as Tokio took it.</p><p>Tokio unfolded the paper and stared at it for a long time. "Did you read this?" Tokio asked in a dangerous tone.</p><p>The man jerked a nod. "Yeah Boss."</p><p>Tokio grunted and looked at the paper again. "It's from the Ice Queen." Tokio said in cold, angry tones.</p><p>"Yeah, Boss." The man agreed. The man licked his lips. "Boss, what does it mean; a finger isn't enough?"</p><p>"It means nothing." Tokio snorted. "Bitch thinks she can frighten, Tokio Wasuhara." He sneered. "With what; strippers and whores? Who does she think she's kidding? She was useful at the beginning by keeping the cops away but now..." Tokio's head snapped up at a knock on his office door. "Go see who that is." He ordered his lieutenant. The man hurried to obey glad to put some more distance between himself and his fuming boss. "Yeah?" He said to the closed door. He cocked his ear but heard nothing. The man reached his hand inside his jacket. Like most Yakusa, the lieutenant favored the knife. "Boss, get down." He said in a low voice. He opened the door. He immediately tried to slam it shut. He grunted in pain as the door exploded inward.</p><p>A middle aged man with a gray mustache and wearing a dark gi entered the room. Following him were two, also middle aged men, a craggy faced stocky man in an ill fitting suit and a Chinese officer. Unlike the gray mustached man or the Yakusa, they had guns. Following them were two attractive women with long blond hair. "Thank you, daddy." One of the blonds said to the mustachioed man. "Hello Tokio."</p><p>"Ice Queen." snarled Tokio Wasuhara. "How did you get passed my men?"</p><p>"Your men?" Nabiki Tendo purred. "Daddy can be so persuasive when he wants to be." Soun's head was suddenly replaced by a demon's head with horns and forked tongue. The head snaked toward Tokio on an impossibly long neck. The demon bared his teeth in Tokio's face before snapping back and vanishing, leaving the mustached man staring coldly at the Yakusa lord. "See what I mean." Nabiki said. She smiled at the mustached man. She turned her attention back to Tokio. "You broke the rules, Tokio, my rules." She said in her coldest tones.</p><p>"Fuck your rules." Tokio spat. "I don't take orders from a damn cunt."</p><p>"Your loss." The other blond said.</p><p>"Fuck you, bitch." Tokio snapped.</p><p>"Tokio Wasuhara?" The craggy faced man said in mild tones. "I'm Captain Chikato Noriudo of the Tokyo Police." He indicated the uniformed man next to him. "This is Captain Li Chiang Bo, my counterpart from China." The Chinese officer sketched a short bow with an amused expression on his face. "Captain Li and I shared a common trait, we're pragmatists."</p><p>"There will always be things people want that not allowed." The Chinese captain said in heavily accented Japanese. "Some things' women, liquor." The captain shrugged. "Maybe we don't look too closely."</p><p>"What we don't want is a reason to look too closely." Captain Noriudo's voice became a growl. "It upsets people." He pointed a finger. "You." He said. "You upset people."</p><p>"I told you at the beginning, Tokio." Nabiki said. "I'd make you rich, all you had to do was do what I told you to do." She said. "I thought I made it simple enough even for you." Nabiki's features froze into immobility. "The girls were bad enough, would have been enough." She said in the iciest of tones. "Drugs would have been enough, guns would have been enough." She said. "Enough." The last was a statement.</p><p>"You think you've beaten me?" Tokio said in a sneer. Tokio looked at the two police officers. "I sent a dozen of my best men over to the Kuno bitches club." He laughed. "By now they've got that little mountain girl, they don't hear from me soon, you'll never hear from her." His smiled was cold. "Again." Tokio straightened his jacket.</p><p>Nabiki shook her head. "An empty threat, Tokio." She said. "Did you actually think I'd leave the girl unwatched?" If Tokio's smile was cold, Nabiki's barely registered above absolute zero. "No Tokio, Pema is quite safe."</p><p>"If I go down, you all go down." Tokio threatened. "There's no way it won't come out in the trial."</p><p>"Trial, Tokio?" Nabiki asked. "What makes you think there will be a trial?" She waved a hand to indicate the two Police officers, one Chinese, one Japanese. "Did either one of these two gentlemen say anything about arresting you?" Her smile was as cold as her voice. "Good bye, Tokio." Nabiki turned to leave. She took about five steps before she stopped and turned. "Oh, I almost forgot." She said. "Kimi." Nabiki said and reached out a hand. Kimi slapped an envelope into Nabiki's palm. Nabiki walked over to the Chinese Captain. "I understand you usually send a bill for the bullet to the family of the deceased." Nabiki offered the envelope to the Chinese Captain. "I think his family has suffered enough shame."</p><p>Nabiki turned and walked out of the office. Kimi followed just behind. Soun took a last look at Tokio Wasuhara, shook his head and then followed his daughter out of the office.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Jiro and Daisuke walked quietly down the emergency stairwell toward the first floor. They reached the second landing when the lights in the stairwell went out. "Not bad." Said an ironic voice. "But you need to work on being a little quieter." The two young men, well trained martial artists, immediately went on guard. ""Relax." Said the voice quietly. "We're Kuno."</p><p>"We?" Jiro asked. "Kuno?"</p><p>"Shade your eyes." The voice ordered. The two men covered their eyes loosely. A greenish glow dimly illumninated the stairwell. By the green light Jiro and Daisuke realized they were surrounded by four men. Though one seemed more interested in the door then them. More importantly they recognized the man holding the light.</p><p>"Yoshi." Daisuke said in recognition, having seen the Kuno retainer at the club. He turned to Jiro. "We should have figured there'd be someone watching." Daisuke turned back to the retainer. "Miss Nodoka is our responsibility."</p><p>"And Kiko and Pema are ours." Yoshi replied.</p><p>"Yoshi." Hissed a voice. "They're here." The light was immediately doused.</p><p>"How many?" Yoshi asked.</p><p>There was a pause as the man peeked through the door. "Shit." The man exclaimed in a hushed voice. "It must be a dozen men."</p><p>Jiro and Daisuke exchanged looks. They nodded. "They'll have to go through us." Jiro said grimly. Yoshi gave them a short bow and turned to the other Ninja. "Kuno honor is at stake. They shall not pass." He said in quiet yet firm tones. The six men turned to the door as one. "With the elevator out they must come this way." Yoshi said quietly. They waited. Suddenly there were shouts then screams and then something thudded against the door forcing it open. The men tensed and prepared to defend but nothing happened. One of the Ninja leaned closer. "He ain't moving." The Ninja said. More screams came from the main club. And Yoshi, his Ninja and Jiro and Daisuke rushed out of the stairwell.</p><p>A large number of the biggest men short of Sumo Wrestlers, and not by much, were chasing after three bouncing women who seemed to be fighting the men. One women, a tiny and busty redhead, went out of her way to taunt the men as she'd dart in with a quick series of punches and kicks that seemed to have an affect way out of proportion to her diminutive form. Another women, this one with dark blue black hair, was picking up and tossing the oversized thugs toward the third woman, this one brown haired held with a bow, who would bat them out of the air with an over sized spatula.</p><p>"Whoa." Breathed Jiro and Daisuke in unison. Their breath steamed. "Damn, it's getting cold in here." Jiro said. As he looked a frost started forming on first the mirror behind the bar, then along the brass railings. The three women suddenly closed up into a triangle as if they were getting tired. Sensing an advantage Tokio Wasuhara's men regrouped and charged and the three women were buried under a pile of thugs. "We have to help them." Jiro shouted and charged. Daisuke was barely a step behind. Yoshi jerked his head and he and his Ninja followed.</p><p>Jiro and Daisuke reached the pile of shifting, straining bodies just as it exploded outward in a blast of cold air. "Brrr." Jiro and Daisuke chattered. Pops and cracking sounds filled the air as the mirror shattered and the various bottles of wines and other liquors exploded. Standing in the center of where the pile of bodies had been were the three women a blue nimbus of energy surrounded them. Each woman had the same serene smile on their faces. Jiro looked at Daisuke. "I guess they didn't need any help, after all." He said. Daisuke nodded slowly in shocked agreement but it didn't stop either of the two young men from making sure that the dazed thugs didn't get a chance to recover.</p><p>Even dazed the thugs, by virtue of their size and endurance still managed to put up a resistance and the fight continued. Jiro blocked a knife thrust from one thug as Daisuke slammed a fist into the same thug's gut. Yoshi and his team took care of another. One by one the thugs fell until with a double kick to the head by Jiro and Daisuke the last thug fell. For a long moment silence reigned as the victors looked around for another attacker not realizing they had already won. Then the sound of wild clapping broke the silence. As one all eyes turned to the source of the applause.</p><p>Standing in the doorway and clapping and cheering like sports fans were Nodoka, Pema and Kiko. "See I told you, they gods." Exclaimed Pema in tones of vindication.</p><p>First Ranma, then Ukyo seemed to shiver for a second and the air seemed to get a little warmer. There was still the cold chi coming off of Akane. Ranma frowned. "Tomboy?" She said in concerned tones.</p><p>Akane's expression barely changed. "It's going to hurt." Akane said.</p><p>Before Ranma or Ukyo could say anything Pema ran up. "Oh that so wonderful." She gushed. She stopped at the expressions on Ranma and Ukyo's face. "What wrong?" She asked in concern. She searched the three's faces. "Why Akane look so," She searched for a word. "So empty?" Her hand reached out. "Cold." Pema's hand went to her mouth. "Oh no." Pema turned to Ranma. "Please Ranma, no let Akane return to Heaven. It not time." She turned back to Akane. "No Akane, please no leave Pema."</p><p>Akane looked at Pema for a long moment. "You want me to stay?" Pema nodded rapidly. Akane blinked and shivered. She swallowed. "That wasn't so bad." She reached out and tousled Pema's hair. "I'm back." Pema threw her arms around Akane. "Hey, hey. It's alright." She said as Pema hugged her tightly. "I'm not going anywhere." Pema hugged Akane even tighter.</p><p>Ranma, satisfied that Akane was okay, turned his attention to his mother. He frowned as the two young men, Jiro and Daisuke, were being soundly kissed by Nodoka. "Let it go, Ran-chan." Ukyo said quietly. "They could have run but they didn't."</p><p>Ranma sighed. "Yeah." He looked around. "Yoshi." He called. "Everything under control?"</p><p>"Everything's fine." The Kuno retainer replied. He was holding Kiko's hand. "Ms. Kuno called. They're on their way back. You can take off if you want."</p><p>"That's probably a good idea." Ranma replied with a last look at his Mother. He turned and walked over to Akane and Pema. Ukyo just behind. "You guys wanna go home?"</p><p>"You want to go home, Pema?" Akane asked the Tibetan girl who still hadn't let go.</p><p>Pema looked up and nodded. "I go say goodbye to Kiko first." She said. Pema reluctantly let go of Akane and with a couple backwards glances, as if to reassure herself Akane was still there, went over to Kiko. Ranma and Ukyo stood next to Akane. "You okay, Tomboy?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Akane nodded. "I think so." She ran a hand through her short hair. "Hey Ranma, you mind if I carried Pema home?"</p><p>Ranma smiled. "Sure Tomboy." He replied. "I think she'd like that."</p><p>"I think I'd like that too." Akane replied. Akane smiled as Pema ran up. "Ready to go, Pema?" Pema nodded. Akane scooped Pema into her arms. "I thought I'd give Ranma a break." Akane said to the surprised Pema as they walked out of the club. "I hope that's okay?"</p><p>Pema looked at Akane for a second then wiggled to make herself more comfortable. "That very fine, Akane." Pema said happily. Minutes later they were bouncing along the rooftops and toward home.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The door to the apartment opened and Ranma, Ukyo and Akane, still carrying Pema, entered the apartment. For some reason Akane seemed reluctant to put Pema down and Pema seemed just as reluctant to be put down. Finally Akane just sat down on the couch with Pema on her lap. "And here I thought I was going to worry about YOU and Pema." Ukyo said to Ranma in a quiet aside. "I'll make tea." Ukyo announced in a louder voice.</p><p>"Need help, Uk-chan?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Nah." Ukyo replied. "Why don't you go sit with Akane and Pema?" Ukyo walked into the kitchen while Ranma walked over to Akane and Pema. "I'm sorry I frightened you, Pema." Ranma heard Akane say as he sat down.</p><p>"She really didn't mean it, Pema." Ranma added. "Sometimes it's hard for the Tomboy to come back."</p><p>Pema nodded in understanding. "Heaven must be wonderful." She said. "I know Pema be selfish but..." Pema searched for words. "Pema happy you stay."</p><p>"So am I." Ranma said in agreement. "Looks like you're stuck here, Tomboy." Ranma said cheerfully. Ranma placed an arm around Akane's shoulders.</p><p>"Yeah, I guess so." Akane mock grumped. "I thought you were in love with Ranma?" Akane said to Pema.</p><p>Pema paled for a second. "Am." She admitted quietly. "But Pema love all of you." She amended in a louder voice. "Pema should know better than keep secrets from gods." She said mostly to herself. "Please forgive."</p><p>"Nothing to forgive, baby." Akane replied. She looked up as Ukyo came out of the kitchen.</p><p>"Tea's up.'" Ukyo announced. "I made us a snack." She placed a tray with several mugs of tea and a plate of cookies on the small table in front of the couch and then sat down on Ranma's other side. "Though I'm not sure Akane should get a cookie. Not with that grumpy look on her face."</p><p>"More for me then." Ranma said cheerfully. She reached for a cookie and had her hand slapped by Pema. "Hey." Ranma complained. Then she grinned widely. "Okay Pema, I'll be good." She leaned over to Pema. "Whenever she gets too grumpy, Uk-chan and I usually tickle her." Ranma confided.</p><p>"Back of her knees is a good place." Ukyo said. She sipped her tea. Pema giggled. "Okay, maybe one cookie." Ukyo said. "If we get a smile."</p><p>Akane rolled her eyes. "Threats, nothing but threats." She said. Akane smiled.</p><p>"Ahh." Pema said in awe. "Now that how a god supposed to smile."</p><p>"Gotta agree with Pema on that." Ranma said.</p><p>Ukyo put down her cup. "Who's up for a nice cuddle?"</p><p>"Me." Ranma and Akane chorused.</p><p>"How about you, Pema?" Ukyo asked. Pema nodded rapidly. "Oh good. Well since you brought Akane back, you get to decide."</p><p>"Decide?" Asked Pema.</p><p>"Um hmm." Ukyo grinned. "So which Ranma do you want to cuddle with, Boy or Girl?"</p><p>Pema blushed. "Well if it okay with Akane." Pema said hesitantly. "Boy?"</p><p>"Steak." Chorused Ukyo and Akane. Akane swatted Ranma on the back of the head. "Go change." She ordered. "And wear your red pajamas." She said. "No boxers when Pema's with us." Akane waited until Ranma was out of the room. "Ground rules time." She said to Pema. "Right now, you are way too young." She said. "Cuddling is okay, looking is okay." Akane said seriously. "Touching, especially when Ranma is a guy, you ask me or Ukyo, anything beyond that is out. Understand?"</p><p>"Yes, Akane." Pema said meekly.</p><p>"Good." Akane replied. She stood taking Pema with her. "Now, let's see if one of my nightgowns will fit you." Akane placed Pema on her feet. "Hmm, if I'm blue and Uk-chan's silver." Akane mused. "Green?" She asked. "Or yellow?"</p><p>"What do you think, Pema?" Ukyo asked as they walked toward the bedroom. "Personally, I think you'd look good in green."</p><p>"If you think so, Ukyo, then I think so." Pema chirped happily. Pema reached up and pinched the inside of her arm. "No. Not dreaming." She said. Pema blushed when Akane and Ukyo laughed. They entered the bedroom. "Where Ranma?" Pema asked.</p><p>"Waiting for you to change." Akane replied. "Now, we said green, right?"</p><p>Pema sat on the edge of the bed as Akane brushed her hair. "Now remember, no touching without permission." Akane said in a firm yet gentle voice. "And that includes me and Uk-chan." Akane said in an amused tone.</p><p>"Yes, Akane." Pema replied quietly. There was a knock on the door and Pema looked up eagerly.</p><p>"Hey guys, can I come in now?" Ranma's plaintive voice came through the door.</p><p>"Should we let him in, Pema?" Akane asked. Pema nodded so fast her teeth chattered. "Come in Ranma." The door opened and Ranma, in red silk pajamas, walked into the bedroom. Pema immediately looked down. Ranma walked over to the bed and stood in front of Pema. His hand cupped her chin and raised her head until she was looking into his eyes.</p><p>"You don't look down for anyone." Ranma said gently. "Especially not me." He said. "Did you explain the rules, Tomboy?" Ranma asked without breaking eye contact with Pema. Akane made a noise signifying an affirmative. "Good." Ranma said. "Now, we're just going to cuddle. Understand?"</p><p>Pema nodded. "Yes, Ranma."</p><p>"Okay then." Ranma said. "Where's she sleeping, Tomboy?"</p><p>"Between you and me." Akane replied. "Uk-chan gets to decide who's back she cuddles up against." She said. "As if I didn't know." Ukyo stuck her tongue out at Akane. "If Pema wasn't here I'd make you use that tongue."</p><p>Pema suddenly looked stricken. "Oh no, I causing problem."</p><p>"Relax, sugar." Ukyo said gently. "We got plenty of opportunity to fool around. The Tomboy can go a night or two without it."</p><p>"Yeah, but not more than two nights." Ranma added. "Then she gets cranky."</p><p>"Don't listen to them, Pema." Akane said in testy tones. "Sometimes I can go three, even four nights." Akane smiled when Pema giggled. "That's better." She said. Akane looked at Ranma. "Well get in, we promised Pema a cuddle." Ranma grinned and got into the bed. Ukyo immediately jumped in a cuddled up to Ranma's back. "Go ahead, Pema." Pema got into the bed and was wrapped in Ranma's arms. Akane got in and Pema found herself in a two way hug. A moment later Ukyo reached around Ranma and placed a hand on Pema's shoulder.</p><p>"Oh, this must be what Heaven like." Pema said in near ecstacy. "Pema never knew she could be so, so happy." She cried. "Ow." She said suddenly. "Ranma pinch me, Akane." Pema pouted.</p><p>"That was just to show you, you weren't dreaming." Ranma said cheerfully. "Ow." He said suddenly. "Akane, Uk-chan pinched me."</p><p>"Don't even think it." Akane said warningly to no one in particular. "They can be such children, sometimes." Akane said.</p><p>Pema giggled and wiggled against Ranma to make herself more  her head pillowed on Ranma's arm and wrapped in Akane's arms, Pema didn't think it was possible she could ever be happier. She closed her eyes, only to open them again a minute later. "Akane?" Pema whispered.</p><p>"Yeah, Pema." Akane replied.</p><p>"Pema think, maybe, Pema should not sleep here." Pema said in slightly nervous tones. "Pema think, maybe, Ranma need his womans."</p><p>"You getting a hard on dummy?" Akane said crossly.</p><p>"Oh like I can control it, Tomboy." Ranma replied. "Sorry Pema." He said. "I can switch with Ukyo if it bothers you."</p><p>"No, no, it not bother Pema." Pema said quickly. "Pema just," She stopped. "Pema not want Ranma not be happy." Pema moistened her lips. "Pema think Ranma be very uncomfortable."</p><p>"I can always turn girl, you know." Ranma said.</p><p>"No!" Pema said quickly. "I mean..." She stopped as Akane and Ukyo started giggling. "You're making fun of Pema."</p><p>"Well, maybe a little." Akane said teasingly. She tapped Pema on the nose. "But's that's only cause we really, really like you." She said. "If we didn't, you wouldn't be here." Akane smiled at Pema. "Relax Pema, nothing is going to happen." Akane suppressed a laugh as both relief and disappointment warred on the young Tibetan girl's face. She leaned forward. "You're very cute, you know." She said quietly. Pema blushed.</p><p>"I really don't mind being a girl, if you're uncomfortable, Pema." Ranma said with quiet humor. "Though the guys say I cuddle better as a guy."</p><p>"Much better." Ukyo added. "And Ran-chan is really cuddly as a girl but sometimes I like being held." She said. "Don't you?"</p><p>Pema nodded. "Pema like being held very much." She sighed when Ranma tightened his hold on her. "Ranma cuddle very nice." She giggled quietly. "Still think Ranma be very uncomfortable."</p><p>"He'll live." Akane said. Pema giggled again. "You're not here for that. You're way too young." Akane continued. "You're here because we really, really like you."</p><p>Pema sighed happily. "That very nice, Akane." Pema replied. She closed her eyes and let herself revel in Ranma's embrace and the feeling of belonging. "Akane?" She said after a minute or so.''</p><p>"Yes, Pema?" Akane replied.</p><p>"When Pema no too young?" Pema asked without opening her eyes.</p><p>"Soon, Pema, soon." Akane replied gently.</p><p>Pema smiled. "Thank you, Akane." She wiggled herself closer to Ranma. "Ukyo rifght. Ranma cuddle better as boy."</p><p>End Chapter 4</p><p>End Book 6</p><p>Author's Notes: Another Book done. I'm always sad when I post the last chapter of any book. Still it isn't really over.
