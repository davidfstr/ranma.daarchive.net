</div><p>Chapter 7</p><p>'Kinnikun'</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno took his small flotilla across the narrow straight between the Japanese main island and Hokkaido. He stood on the bow of his yacht and watch the coast line approach. Tatewaki heard footsteps behind him. "Captain." Tatewaki said without turning around.</p><p>"Milord." Captain Osigi said. He stood next to Tatewaki and stared out over the water. "Your sister has safely arrived in Hokkaido."</p><p>"Thank you Captain." Tatewaki said solemnly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A long, black limosine was waiting as Kodachi exited the airport. Yoshi placed the bags in the trunk and then sat with the driver while Yuki sat in the back with Kodachi and Noriko. Instead of driving toward the center of the city as Noriko expected the limo took them away from the city. "Where are we going?" Noriko asked.<p>"Oh a charming little inn I discovered the last time I was here." Kodachi said offhandedly. "It doesn't have the convenience of being close to the city but we do have the limo." Kodachi smiled slightly. "I also felt it prudent to have some measure of distance between ourselves and Tokio." She turned to look at Noriko. "I hope you don't mind."</p><p>"Mind?" Noriko shook her head. "Uh uh. The man's a sleezeball and you know it." Noriko waved a hand in dismissal. "Just because he''s smart doesn't mean he's not slimy." She snorted. "As if you'd be interested in the likes of him." She sneered. "Not even for half a million yen." She said seriously. "You'd never be that desperate." She looked closely at Kodachi. "He made a pass at you." She said suddenly. "Didn't he?" Her voice became a growl. "Why that slimy, how dare he."</p><p>"It wasn't exactly a pass. But his intentions were obvious." Kodachi laughed. "He is slimy isn't he?" She said in agreement. "Not even half a million yen?" She asked teasingly.</p><p>"Not even a million yen." Noriko said firmly.</p><p>"Goodness." Kodachi said in amusement. "My price just keeps going up and up." She said. "At this rate no one will ever be able to afford me." Noriko joined in when Kodachi laughed. Kodachi sobered. "What do the girls do when faced with a similar situation?" She asked.</p><p>Noriko shrugged. "Close our eyes and think about the money." Noriko admitted. She shook a finger at Kodachi. "But that's us, not you." She said.</p><p>"I suppose." Kodachi admitted reluctantly. "Still it does worry me." She said. "I want the girls to be, I don't know, happy I guess."</p><p>Noriko smiled. "We are Kodachi." She said. "Mainly because we know that's what you want." She put an arm around Kodachi's shoulders. "Now, no more talking about Tokio, at least not anymore than we have to." She amended. "Does this place have a hot spring?" She asked.</p><p>"Why it just so happens it does." Kodachi replied.</p><p>"Oh good." Noriko replied.</p><p>Yuki listened silently to the back and forth conversation between Kodachi and Noriko. It didn't bother her that she wasn't included in that conversation. In fact she was grateful. It allowed her to pay attention to her surroundings. Whether in household uniform or a dress she was first and foremost a Kuno retainer. Like all Kuno retainers she was well trained in the martial arts. She may not be in the same league as Sasuki. 'That bandy legged little troll may be funny looking.' She had often thought. 'But he's a talented little troll.' She didn't even consider herself in the same league as her Mistress. A fact that filled her with both annoyance and pride. With the pride being the most dominant. No she may not have been in the same league but she was well trained and ready and eager to prove herself.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The next afternoon Nodoka walked into the club a little hesitantly. 'Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.' She thought in dismay. 'Nodoka Saotome what came over you?' She blushed as memory came unbidden. Her blush deepened as the waitress Fumie ran up to greet her.<p>"Good afternoon Auntie." Fumie greeted the older woman. She saw the expression on Nodoka's face. "Auntie? Is something the matter?"</p><p>"Is something the matter?" Nodoka echoed in disbelief. "I made a complete fool of myself and you ask if something is the matter?" She said angrily.</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Fumie asked in confusion.</p><p>"You know what I'm talking about." Nodoka snapped. "Those two young men. You all must have laughed yourselves silly."</p><p>"Laugh?" Fumie's confusion deepened. "Why would we laugh?" She asked. "Didn't you enjoy yourself." Her expression became apologetic. "If those two boys did anything to displease you," She began. "Oh Auntie, I'm sorry but I thought they would make you happy."</p><p>Nodoka's anger ebbed and was replaced by confusion. "You weren't trying, I mean it wasn't a joke?"</p><p>"Joke?" Fumie replied. "Of course not Auntie. Why would we do that?" Fumie exclaimed. "You're our Auntie Nodoka. We, all of us, wanted you to have a good time." She said. "Well if those two weren't any good, I'm sure there are plenty of young men who would be honored to try to make you happy."</p><p>"No. No, they were," Nodoka blushed redly. "They were fine." She finished weakly. "It's just that, oh I think I'm making an even bigger fool of myself." She said. Nodoka wrung her hands. "It's just so embarrassing."</p><p>"Why?" Fumie asked in puzzlement. "Miki isn't embarrassed. Aoi isn't embarrassed. None of the girls are embarrassed by what they do." She shrugged. "It's what they do." She said. "Besides, I thought they were pretty cute." She elbowed Nodoka gently. "You thought they were pretty cute, didn't you?"</p><p>"Well yes." Admitted Nodoka. "But, but I'm a married woman." She said. "It's just not done."</p><p>"Why not? Half the men that come here are married." Fumie pointed out. "And I think I remember you complaining about a lack of attention." Fumie smiled. "Relax Auntie, no one thinks less of you." She stated. "Though if you keep giving it away for free." She giggled at the expression on Nodoka's face. "Now that was a joke." Fumie said. She leaned closer. "However don't be surprised if there is a line of young men hoping to get as lucky." She said conspiratorally.</p><p>"Fumie." Nodoka scolded as she blushed.</p><p>"Don't say I didn't warn you." Fumie said. "Oh by they way, there was a delivery for you. I put it in Ms Kuno's office."</p><p>"Delivery?" Nodoka asked as they started walking. "What was delivered?" Nodoka turned her head when Fumie didn't answer. "Fumie?"</p><p>"I think you should see for yourself." Fumie said in an obviously teasing tone. They reached Kodachi's office and Fumie stepped aside. "After you." She chirped.</p><p>Nodoka looked at Fumie suspiciously then at the door. With a sigh Nodoka opened the door and stepped into the office. Nodoka stopped and her hand shot to her mouth. "Oh my." She breathed. On the desk, in fact covering the desk, was an elegant and obviously expensive floral display. Nodoka walked slowly to the desk. "It's beautiful." She breathed.</p><p>"There's a card." Fumie said innocently.</p><p>"Card?" Nodoka looked at the flowers on the desk. She quickly found the card tucked among the flowers. She reached for the card hesitantly. Nodoka picked up the card and opened it. Only her eyes moved as she silently read the card. She noticed that there were two signatures on the bottom. Nodoka put the card back in it's envelope and tucked it in her kimono. "Well it seems that some young men have manners." She said.</p><p>"Nice card huh?" Fumie smiled.</p><p>"It was very sweet." Nodoka straightened her kimono and patted at her hair. She turned around. "I suppose I should go out and see if I'm needed to sign anything." She said  said. They walked out into the club. "Oh and Fumie?"</p><p>"Yes Auntie?" Fumie replied.</p><p>"Have my private table made ready at, oh about 8:30." Nodoka said. Nodoka blushed redly as Fumie broke up laughing.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Ms Kuno." Kinnikun Honda greeted the veiled woman with pleasure evident in his voice and his face. He was a tall powerfully buiilt man in his mid forties with slicked back black hair. "I have heard so many good things about you."<p>"Thank you Mr Honda. As I you." Kodachi replied. "May I introduce my aide and companion, Noriko Mata."</p><p>"Ms Mata." Kinnikun Honda ran his eyes over Noriko. "A pleasure." Noriko nodded her head in greeting. "You don't know how happy I am that you're here." He leaned forward. "You're rescuing me from an evening of interminable boredom." He said conspiratorally. He offered his arms to Kodachi and Noriko and to his pleasure they looped their arms through them. "My colleagures are, much as I respect them, not known for their conversational skills." He smiled at the suppressed giggle that came from both Noriko and Kodachi.</p><p>"Has Tokio Wasahara arrived?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Unfortunately yes." Kinnikun replied. "What does the Ice Queen see in him?" He asked curiously. "The man is vulgar beyond belief."</p><p>"Vulgar yes." Kodachi replied seriously. "But don't let yourself be distracted by his vulgarity, he is also very intelligent and very ruthless."</p><p>"I will take your recommendation under consideration." Kinnikun replied gravely. He led them to a conversation nook that was occupied by a number of older men, several quite elderly. "Well here she is." Kinnikun said. "The Black Widow." He said in introducing Kodachi. "And her trusted companion, Noriko Mata."</p><p>"You make us sound like a comic book crime fighting duo." Noriko said in amusement. She smiled triumphantly as both Kodachi and Kinnikun laughed. She smiled at the assembled Yakusa lords. Several she recognized from Kimi's briefing before they left. Kinnikun introduced Kodachi and Noriko. Seated in one chair was Tokio Wasamura. He rasied a glass in greeting. Kodachi and Noriko gave Tokio a short, though respectful, bow in greeting.</p><p>"Please be seated." Kinnikun said. His hand waved toward a  made sure both Kodachi and Noriko were seated on a wide couch before he himself sat. "Thank you again for coming." Kinnikun took a comfortable chaiir closest to Kodachi. He raised a hand and a servant hurried over. "Something to drink?" He asked Kodachi and Noriko. "I understand you prefer French wine." He said. "That's one thing we have in common." He said to Kodachi. "I think you might enjoy this delightful Cabernet I have acquired."</p><p>Kodachi smiled behind her veil and nodded. "That sounds lovely." She said in gracious tones.</p><p>"And you Ms Mata?" Kinnikun asked.</p><p>"I'll have whatever Ms Kuno is having." Noriko said with a slight smile. 'Putting on the charm, isn't he?' She thought in mild amusement. 'Though I'm not sure which of us he is trying to impress.' Her smile widened slightly.</p><p>Kinnikun waved the servant away. He turned back to Kodachi. " It wont be but a moment." He said.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. The servant came back with a tray. He offered the tray first to Kodachi and then Noriko. Once everyone had their drinks the servant took up a station at the far end of the room. Close enough to respond to any requests and far enough away to allow the conversation to be private. Kodachi raised her glass. "To new friends." She toasted.</p><p>Kinnikun smiled widely. "Something truly to be hoped for." He replied. He raised his glass. "To new friends."</p><p>Tokio suppressed any show of amusement. 'Friends.' He glanced at Kinnikun. 'Friends is not what he has in mind.' His smile turned slightly sour. 'Too bad the only person the Black Widow is spreading her legs for is that little whore.' He smiled nastily. 'I wonder if she knows Ky used to fuck her?'</p><p>Noriko also watched the interplay between Kodachi and Kinnikun. She too realized that Kinnikun was strongly attracted to Kodachi. Kinnikun turned his head and smiled at Noriko. 'And me as well.' She smiled back at Kinnikun. 'Good looking, smart, dangerous.' She thought in admiration. She stole a quick glance at Kodachi. 'I wonder.' She thought musingly.</p><p>The meeting was, as Kodachi expected, more of a social gathering than anything. No negotiations of any sort would occur today. Today was devoted to getting to know each other. Kodachi had to admit that Tokio managed to keep his cruder comments to a minimum and it didn't take long for Kodachi to realize that an alliance was foremost on the senior Tendo Yakusa lord's mind. 'So he can control himself if he wishes.' She thought. 'At least when the stakes are high enough.' She amended mentally. As for Kinnikun Honda, Kodachi was impressed. 'The Ice Queen would do well to forge an alliance with this one.'</p><p>Kinnikun Honda smiled in satisfaction as the meeting began to wind down. He found he had to revise his estimate of his guests several times during the meeting. At first he considered Kodachi and Noriko nothing more than eye candy and assumed Tokio was the actual negotiator. Now he realized that the woman referred to as the Black Widow was the key player. Not that he dismissed Tokio, he realized that the man deserved his reputation and his position but Kodachi Kuno impressed him more than he let on. 'With a woman like that at my side I could own Hokkaido itself.' He thought. 'A pity she is still in mourning.' He smiled at Noriko. 'Aide.' He mused. 'According to Tokio she's nothing more than a whore.' He suppressed a snort. 'Somehow that doesn't feel right.'</p><p>Kinnikun Honda shrugged mentally. "Well this has been a very productive meeting." He said smoothly. "I must say the Ice Queen seems to surround herself with very capable people." Kinnikun said.</p><p>"The Ice Queen greatest skill has always been finding the right person for the job." Kodachi replied. "And she rarely lets her emotions get in the way."</p><p>"I gotta admit she's got the right of it." Tokio added. "Coldest bitch I've ever met."</p><p>"Indeed." Kinnikun said noncommitedly. 'She must be if she can stand you.' He thought in contempt. He gave Noriko a quick glance and caught the barely concealed look of similar contempt on the woman's face. "Yes, well being the head of an influential family is not something for weaklings." He said. "I too have been called cold."</p><p>"Surely not." Kodachi said surprising herself. She stood. "I must admit meeting you has been a greater pleasure than I expected but Noriko and I must be going."</p><p>Kinnikun hastily got to his feet. "Of course." He said amiably. "Please let me escort you two lovely ladies to the door." Kinnikun walked with Kodachi and Noriko to the door of his suite.</p><p>At the door Kodachi raised her hand, which Kinnikun immediately took in his hand. He bowed over Kodachi's hand and, to Kodachi's surprise, kissed the back of her hand. To her further surprise he repeated the gesture with Noriko. "I see you spent some time in France." She said in a slightly flustered tone. Kinnikun nodded. "Well again, it was a pleasure," She paused. "Kinnikun."</p><p>Kinnikun smiled agreeably. "For me as well Kodachi." He replied. He turned to Noriko. "A great pleasure, Noriko." He said.</p><p>"Bye Kinnikun." Noriko chirped. Noriko looked at Kodachi. 'Well, well what do you know.' Noriko looped her arm through Kodachi's and guided her out of the room and the building. Noriko waited until they were back in the limo before she said anything. "Now that." She declared. "Is a man."</p><p>Kodachi was jolted out of whatever reverie she was in. "Why would anyone think he was cold?" She said in a distracted tone.</p><p>"I thought he was pretty hot too." Noriko giggled.</p><p>"Noriko." Kodachi scolded. "That was not what I meant." She said. "Though I must admit he had a certain something."</p><p>"In other words you thought he was hot." Noriko replied.</p><p>"I did not." Kodachi replied haughtily.</p><p>"Sure." Noriko said knowingly. "Well if you don't want him, can I have him?" She half begged. "I bet he's hung too."</p><p>"Noriko." Kodachi said in scandalized tones. "You are incorrigible, did you know that?"</p><p>"If that means a man like that makes me horny, oh yeah." Noriko giggled. "Heck I'd do him for free."</p><p>Kodachi raised an eyebrow. "Truly?" Noriko nodded. "Do you really want to sleep with him?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Well I don't know how much sleep I'd get." Noriko said cheerfully. "You know, if it was any other Yakusa boss, he'd sort of expect a woman." She said thoughtfully. "It's kind of traditional." She explained.</p><p>"Well he did seem taken with you." Kodachi said reluctantly and, to her chagrin, with a touch of not quite jealousy, though it was part of it.</p><p>"Not as taken as he was with you." Noriko retorted. "Take it from a whore Kodachi, he was looking at you like a kid looks at an ice cream cone." She said. 'Not too thick Noriko, just get her thinking about it.' She thought to herself. "I think the only thing preventing him from propositioning you then and there was your veil." She giggled. "I bet he'd pay a half million yen."</p><p>Kodachi snorted. "I thought you raised my price to a million yen." She said archly.</p><p>"Stud discount." Noriko replied easily. "Everyone else pays the higher price." She smiled as Kodachi giggled.</p><p>"Imp." Kodachi laughed. "Do you really think he was attracted to me?' She asked in a wistful tone.</p><p>"Like iron filings to a magnet." Noriko said firmly. 'Hallelujah, she's thinking about it.' Noriko frowned. "If I know Tokio he's probably already has a girl on hand." She sighed dramatically. "Oh well, there goes that fantasy." Noriko suppressed a grin at the half growl that came from Kodachi. "Something the matter Kodachi?" She asked innocently.</p><p>"He probably did." Kodachi snapped. "That, that pig."</p><p>"Oh I don't know." Noriko replied. "Just being a good business man." She sighed again. "I just hope he picked a decent girl, a bad experience could ruin everything you've worked so hard for." She rolled her eyes. "Probably picked some second string girl." She grumbled. "Now a real Yakusa boss would offer his number one girl." She batted her eyes at Kodachi. "Hint, hint."</p><p>"You really are an imp." Kodachi laughed. "Tired of me already?" She asked in slightly sad tones.</p><p>"Of course not." Noriko said quickly. She leaned closer to Kodachi. "And when we get back to the inn I'll prove it to you." She whispered. Noriko smiled at Kodachi's blush and sat back. "But I was serious about what I said. I really, really hope Tokio picked a decent girl." She said. "Anything less might be considered an insult."</p><p>Kodachi found herself nodding. "You may have a point." Kodachi agreed reluctantly.</p><p>"You know I do." Noriko replied firmly. "I don't know what kind of girls Tokio likes but if they like him," She trailed off and shuddered. "Bleh."</p><p>Kodachi giggled. "I agree, bleh." She looked curiously at Noriko. "Did," She licked dry lips. "Did that happen with Ky?" She asked hesitantly. Noriko nodded. "Oh dear." Kodachi said. "I'm sorry."</p><p>"Why?" Noriko asked in surprise. "Who else could Ky trust to treat a potential ally right?" She preened slightly. "I am very good at what I do you know." She grinned. "And you do know." Noriko suddenly frowned. "The only thing I worry about is that if Kennikun is really insulted I might not be enough." Her mouth twisted slightly. "Maybe we should have one of the other girls, maybe Miki, come out here. Two girls usually is enough to smooth out any insult."</p><p>"I'm sure it wont come to that." Kodachi replied quickly. "We'll just have to trust Tokio to handle it properly." She leaned back against the car seat. "Oh bother." She complained. "Something else to worry about."</p><p>"Have you called Kiko?" Noriko said suddenly. "I mean since this morning?"</p><p>"You know i haven't." Kodachi smiled. "What a wonderful idea." She fished out her cell phone and punched in a number. "Hi Kiko." Kodachi said warmly.</p><p>Yuki had spent the entire ride sitting and listening. There were several times she wanted to shriek in outrage but had kept silent. 'What the hell is she up to?' She thought in concern. As if aware of her gaze Noriko turned to look at Yuki. Yuki let some of her anger show on her face. Noriko raised an eyebrow and leaned forward. "What?" Asked Noriko.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Yuki hissed quietly.</p><p>Noriko snorted. "What do you think?" She turned to look at Kodachi. "Good she's not paying attention." She turned back to Yuki. "Look this is not the time but you have to trust me." Noriko said soothingly. "Wait until we get back to the inn."</p><p>Yuki nodded reluctantly. She sat quietly, though impatiently, for the rest of the ride back. Finally they reached the inn.</p><p>"I'll meet you in the suite." Noriko said to Kodachi. "I have to check something." She waved Kodachi off and waited until Kodachi was out of sight.</p><p>"Okay she's gone." Yuki said. "What were you doing?" She said angrily. "It sounded like you were, were, I don't what you call it but I know you're trying to get her to sleep with that Yakusa."</p><p>"Well if I'm right, she won't sleep too much." Noriko said in amusement. "Of course that's what I'm doing." She asserted to Yuki's surprise. Noriko raised her hands. "Let me explain." She said quickly.</p><p>"You'd better." Yuki said direly.</p><p>"She needs a man and you know it." Noriko said firmly. "She's mourned long enough."</p><p>"But she has you." Yuki protested.</p><p>"Of course she has me." Noriko said in exasperation. "But that woman needs a man, and not just any man, a strong man, a smart man." She smiled. "She likes dangerous men." Noriko looked toward the suite. "She wasn't sure if she could be intimate with anyone ever again." She said without looking at Yuki. "That's where I came in." She turned back to Yuki. To Yuki's surprise the look on Noriko's face was one of sadness mingled with pride. "And she certainly isn't sure she could be with a man again." She continued. "Or love a man again." She shook her head.</p><p>"And now you think she is?" Yuki asked quietly.</p><p>"Maybe." Noriko smiled. "She may need a little help." Noriko giggled. "That's where I come in again." She put her hands on her hips. "I love the woman Yuki. Do you really think I'd hurt her?" She reached over and patted Yuki's hand. "Trust me." She said. "Now if you'll excuse me I must not keep My Lady waiting." With a wave she ran off.</p><p>"No. I suppose you mustn't." Yuki said in bemusement to Noriko's retreating back.</p><p>Noriko entered the  had was sitting in front of the vanity slowly brushing out her hair. There was a pensive look on her face. Noriko walked over and took the brush from Kodachi's unresisting hands and took over the brushing.</p><p>"He was very charming." Kodachi said in a faraway voice. "Wasn't he?" Noriko made a sound of agreement. She turned to look at Noriko. "We must have an alliance with him. We must." She said almost desperately.</p><p>"You'll get the alliance Kodachi." Noriko said soothingly.</p><p>"Not if Tokio insults him." Kodachi replied. Kodachi's face became suffused with rage. "If Tokio ruins this I'll kill him."</p><p>"Then don't let him ruin it." Noriko said firmly.</p><p>"How?" Kodachi asked plaintively.</p><p>"You know how." Noriko replied.</p><p>Kodachi stared at Noriko for a long moment. "I can't." She said in a hoarse whisper. "Ky." Kodachi broke off as tears began to run down her face.</p><p>Noriko took a tissue from the vanity and wiped Kodachi's face. "Ky would understand." She said gently. "Ky would do more than understand. He'd approve." Noriko said. She placed a finger on Kodachi's lips. "Wouldn't you do whatever was necessary to keep what belonged to Ky?" She asked. Noriko held Kodachi's eyes until Kodachi nodded. "You loved Ky." She said. "No one could ever doubt that but it's time for you to start living again." Noriko stood then knelt in front of Kodachi. "It's time baby. It's time."</p><p>"I'm afraid." Kodachi said in a pained  hand went to the bullet that hung between her breasts.</p><p>"I know Dachi." Noriko said soothingly. Noriko placed her hand over Kodachi's. "Ky would understand." Noriko repeated. "Don't worry I'll be there." She withdrew her hand and smiled hopefully at Kodachi. "Just in case you forgot what to do."</p><p>Despite her tears Kodachi laughed. "Imp." She said. "You just want him yourself." She accused. Kodachi wiped her eyes with the back of her hand.</p><p>Noriko smiled triumphantly. "Well yeah." Drawled Noriko. "Trust me, that man is going to be a first class stud." She avowed. "A whore is never wrong about such things."</p><p>Kodachi's hand went back to the bullet between her breasts. She closed her eyes. Images of her times with Ky seemed to flash before her minds' eye. For the first time in longer than she could remember the memories were no longer painful. 'We had some good times, didn't we Ky?' Kodachi took a deep breath and held it for a second then let it out slowly. "Then I must be a whore too." Kodachi said in almost normal tones. "Because I think you're right."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"They're here." Cologne rasped. She pogoed into Hikaru's office. There were two desks, Hikaru occupied the main one, Xian Pu had her own desk off to one side. Xian Pu looked up.<p>"Who here. Great Grandmother?" Xian Pu asked.</p><p>"I think she means Ranma." Hikaru replied impatiently. "In the Susukino most likely." He snorted. "Where else would a whore go?" He said derisively.</p><p>"Airen not whore Airen." Xian Pu said in protest.</p><p>"He takes her clothes off and does lap dances at the very least." Hikaru said dismissively. "He's a whore." He shrugged. "Probably a good one." He waved a hand. "Regardless, the faggot is challenging me." He looked at Cologne. "Don't you agree?"</p><p>Cologne nodded. "Obviously." She agreed. "What is your plan?" She asked.</p><p>"Nothing fancy." Hikaru said. "We'll find out where he is working and hit him in the middle of a set." He smiled. "I figure all the hot chi being given off will hide my own battle chi."</p><p>Xian Pu bent her head over her desk. 'Airen is not a whore.' She thought resentfully. 'And he definitely isn't a faggot.'</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi looked up at the knock on her suite door. The door opened and Yoshi stuck his head in. "Mr Honda is here to see you My Lady."<p>"Please show him in." Kodachi said. "Then make sure we are not disturbed."</p><p>"Of course My Lady." Yoshi replied. He stepped into the room with Kinnikun Honda on his heels. "Ms Kuno will see you now." He said formally to the Yakusa lord. With a final bow Yoshi left.</p><p>Kinnikun Honda smiled as both Kodachi and Noriko walked over to greet him. "Kodachi." He took Kodachi's extended hand in his and bowed over it before kissing the back of her hand. "Noriko." He repeated the gesture. "Thank you so much for inviting me over."</p><p>"It was our pleasure, Kinnikun." Kodachi replied. "Please sit." She said. "Drink?" She asked. "While we don't have anything as delightful as the Cabernet from the other night, we did find a lovely Australian wine I think you might like."</p><p>"Well if you like it, I'm sure it will be nectar." Kinnikun replied. It was obvious from his freshly shaven face and meticulously styled hair to the tailored suit he was wearing that Kinnikun Honda was trying to impress Kodachi just as much as Kodachi was trying to impress him. He sat at the chair indicated. Noriko walked over as soon as he had settled himself with a glass of the wine. Both Kodachi and Noriko seemed to wait anxiously as he tasted the wine.</p><p>Kinnikun swirled the wine in the glass and then stuck his nose close to the rim of the glass and sniffed. He nodded in appreciation. The amount he sipped was just enough to let the wine coat his palate. "Excellent." He said and took a second deeper sip. Kinnikun looked at Kodachi and Noriko over the rim of his glass. Kodachi wore her usual black but somehow, even with her veil, the look didn't have a somber quality. 'My gods she's magnificient.' He thought.</p><p>His gaze shifted to Noriko. As if in order to both contrast and yet reflect Kodachi's black, Noriko wore a green and pastel red dress of a similar cut. Both women were showing a greater amount of leg than at the meeting and the dress was cut to leave their shoulders bare. Kinnikun so lost himself in admiring the feminine view that he missed Kodachi's question. "Excuse me." He said in apology though without any embarrassment. "Forgive me." He said. "I missed what you said." He laughed quietly. "One would think a man of my age would be more immune to feminine beauty."</p><p>"You make yourself sound so old." Kodachi protested. She blushed slightly. "And I think Noriko and I would be somewhat insulted if you didn't notice us." Noriko nodded rapidly in agreement. "Especially after all the work we put into it." Kodachi continued with a shy smile. "And you're obviously in the prime of your life." Kodachi replied to her own near astonishment. 'My gods, I'm flirting with him.' She thought. "I had just wondered if there had been any decision made as yet."</p><p>Kinnikun smiled. "These things take time." He said reassuringly. "I was most impressed with how well you represented the Tendo Yakusa." His eyes narrowed and he frowned. "You seem unduly concerned."</p><p>Kodachi looked at Noriko for a moment then licked dry lips. She waved a hand at Noriko. "My companion brought to my attention a concern of her own nnd I feel I must agree." She began. "Oh dear, how do I ask this?" She hesitated. "If Tokio has done anything to offend you, please accept my apologies on the Ice Queen's behalf."</p><p>Kinnikun looked puzzled for a monent then his face cleared in understanding. "Ah, you refer to his 'gift'." Kinnikun spread his hands in a shrug. "I don't believe he meant it as an insult. She was actually quite attractive in an overblown way. I politely refused." He chuckled. "Please don't concern yourself over it." He looked at Noriko. "Looking out for your boss like a good lieutenant." He said approvingly. "Such loyalty is rare."</p><p>"Indeed." Kodachi concured."I've been thankful ever since I met her." She said. Kodachi leaned forward. "I am gratified you're being so understanding but," Kodachi hesitated.</p><p>"What Kodachi is trying to say is that the Ice Queen would be displeased if you suffered any insult, accidental or not." Noriko explained. "That's why she sent Kodachi." She said. "Tokio looks out for Tokio but Kodachi looks out for the Ice Queen."</p><p>"I see." Kinnikun said thoughtfully."And if I had been insulted?"</p><p>Noriko smiled sultrily. "I don't think anyone would describe me as overblown."</p><p>"Noriko." Kodachi said reprovingly. Then she looked down. "Her loyalty sometimes goes beyond what I would ask." She said quietly. "Of anyone other than myself. But she, like I, understands how important it is that we are successful." To Kinnikun's astonishment Kodachi removed her veil and placed it on the couch next to her.</p><p>"My gods you're even more beautiful than I had imagined." Kinnikun said in near awe. Kinnikun placed his wine glass on the table in fear of spilling it. He leaned forward and seemed to almost try to breath in Kodachi. "I was not insulted." He said almost regretfully. "Would you truly have offered youself if I had been?" He asked curiously.</p><p>"I don't know." Kodachi admitted. "Which is odd because until I met you I knew the answer would have been no." Noriko reached over and squeezed Kodachi's shoulder. "Thank you Noriko." Kodachi said quietly. She looked at Kinnikun. "Would I have been enough to satisfy an insult?"</p><p>"More than enough." Kinnikun said with a slight smile. "There will be an alliance Kodachi."</p><p>"Hmph." Noriko said in disgust. "Couldn't you have pretended to be even a little bit insulted?" She smiled as both Kinnikun and Kodachi laughed, even though she could hear the slight tone of strain in Kodchi's laugh. 'She still laughed.' She thought. "A girl has some pride you know." She shift away from Kodachi and patted the space she made. "Why don't you sit here?"</p><p>"She is an impudent imp." Kodachi said to Kinnikun as he sat between Kodachi and Noriko. "But it's one of the things I like about her." She leaned her arm on Kinnikun's shoulder and looked at him with lidded eyes. "I'm curious." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Curious?" Kinnikun asked as Noriko grabbed his other arm and put it around her shoulders. "I see what you mean about impudent." Kinnikun commented. He turned back to Kodachi. "Curious about what?"</p><p>"A man of your obvious refinement is a Yakuza Oyabun," Kodachi said in a questioning tone.</p><p>"I could say the same about you." Kinnikun replied. Noriko leaned over and started unbuttoning his shirt. "Is she always this forward?" He asked.</p><p>"I fear I've been depriving her of something that I cannot provide." Kodachi said in amusement. "Until now I hadn't realized how deprived she actually felt." She watched Noriko almost frantically unbuttoning Kinnikun's pants. "Do you want her to stop?"</p><p>"No." Kinnikun replied quickly.</p><p>"She actually begged me to let her, did you know that?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"No." Gasped Kinnikun as Noriko reached into his boxers. "I didn't."</p><p>"Hey I'm her number one girl." Noriko replied. "Ooh nice one lover." She purred. "I'm supposed to ask." She looked at Kodachi. "Am I doing this solo?" She asked.</p><p>"For the time being." Kodachi replied. "Don't let me stop you."</p><p>"Okay. I won't." Noriko replied. Noriko pulled Kinnikun's boxers to his ankles.</p><p>"You will tell me if she is doing anything you don't like?" Kodachi said. She leaned against Kinnikun. "And be sure to tell me if I do something you don't like as well." She purred and captaured his mouth with her own.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma sat on the floor doing stretches when the door opened and Akane and Ukyo walked into the dressing room. "Hey guys." Ranma greeted them cheerfully. "How's the crowd?"<p>"Standing room only." Ukyo reported with a slight frown.</p><p>"Wassup?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"I'm not sure." Ukyo said. "Felt something."</p><p>"Something?" Ranma asked curiously.</p><p>"I think I felt something too." Akane replied. "It felt sort of like you." She suddenly looked at Ukyo sharply. "Hikaru?"</p><p>"Maybe." Ukyo rubbed her chin. "Been over a week." She pointed out. "He must know we're here by now." She looked over to where Ranma was starting to rub her hands together in anticipation. "We don't know he's here for sure Ran-chan." Ukyo warned. Suddenly Ukyo smiled. "Oh who am I kidding?" She said. "He's here."</p><p>"Good." Ranma purred. "Boy just wont learn." Ranma shook her head. "Idiot."</p><p>"I think we've given him enough chances Ranma." Akane said coldly. The coldness filled the room.</p><p>"Hey knock it off Akane." Ukyo said in complaint. The room began to warm as Akane dropped out of the Soul of Ice. "Better." She turned to Ranma. "The Tomboy is right, we've given him enough chances." She said grimly. "We've given all of them enough chances." She looked at Akane and then Ranma. "They go down." She said.</p><p>"Hard." Agreed Ranma. "No more games. No more bullshit."</p><p>"Right." Akane and Ukyo chorused.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Good evening and welcome to the Gold Club." The MC said in oily tones. "The Susukino's top club for adult entertainment." He smiled at the large crowd of men, and a number of women. 'I don't think I've seen this many women here before. Not in the crowd anyway.' He thought. "Well we all know why you're here and who you want to see, so without further ado." He waved to the curtain behind him. "You love'em. You want'em." He said. "Usagi, Sugoi. Aoi." He announced. "U.S.A."<p>Ranma, Ukyo and Akane strode panther-like on to the stage. "Hello boys." Akane purred. "It's so nice to see so many of our fans tonight." She put her hands on her hips. "And it looks like we have some new fans. Hello ladies." She said. Akane crooked a finger and Ranma walked over to stand next to her. "Look Usagi." Akane pointed to a group of women sitting together at the edge of the stage.</p><p>"Ooh. A buffet." Ranma chirped to laughter from the crowd and hungry blushes from the group of women.</p><p>"Slut." Akane and Ukyo chorused. Ukyo leaned over. "Better be careful girls, Usagi doesn't take no for an answer."</p><p>"When was the last time you said no Sugoi?" Akane purred.</p><p>Ukyo tapped her lips with a manicured finger. "You know." She said musingly. "I can't remember." Akane and Ranma were now flanking Ukyo. "I'm such a bad girl." As if on cue, which it was, Donna Summer's, 'Bad Girls' started coming through the sound system.</p><p>Hikaru Nakamura and Xian Pu sat at a table near the back of the bar and watched the performace. "Look at him shake his ass." Hikaru commented. "What a faggot."</p><p>Xian Pu glared angrily at Hikaru but kept silent. She turned her attention back to the stage. 'Airen not faggot.' She thought. 'Hmmph.' She snorted. "Ranma only problem is he not find real woman." She said almost to herself. "Real woman, not those pervert girls." Though she wouldn't admit it even to herself Shampoo was secretly impressed with Akane and Ukyo's performance. 'Hmmph.' She thought. 'I can dance better than that.'</p><p>"Maybe I should fuck him first before I kill him." Hikaru mused. "Let him know what it's like with a real man." He said unconsciously echoing Xian Pu.</p><p>Xian Pu laughed coldly. "And you call Ranma faggot?" She sneered. "You know he man and you still want fuck him." She negligently blocked Hikaru's attempted backhand slap. "I almost hope Ranma kick you ass." She smiled snidely. "Again."</p><p>"Watch your mouth bitch." Growled Hikaru. Hikaru took a deep breath and let it out slowly. As he did so the temperature around him started to drop. "We cannot afford to bicker." He said in a near monotone. Hikaru looked at the stage where Ranma, Akane and Ukyo were down to just their tiny bikini bottoms. He stood. "It's time."</p><p>Xian Pu stood as well and the two of them started making their way slowly to the stage. Their progress was hindered by the fact that the closer to the stage they got the denser the crowd got. They were also hindered by the additional reluctance of many of the patrons to give up a prime location though this was mitigated by the discomfort they experienced by the extreme cold that emanated from Hikaru.</p><p>Hikaru let his chi build and, as he reached the foot of the stage, raised his arms in preparation of unleashing a blast of cold chi. He dropped his arms as Ranma, Akane and Ukyo suddenly went into a very fast choreography that made it nearly impossible for Hikaru to focus on any of them. When they slowed he again raised his arms when they suddenly went into a routine that had them rolling across the floor. Hikaru lowered his arms again. 'I can wait.' He thought. Hikaru continued to let his chi build.</p><p>Akane stopped moving and took a cute bent over pose and held it. Ranma backflipped until she was cuddled up to Akane's back and a moment later Ukyo was cuddled up against Ranma's back. Hikaru raised his arms and sent a blast of all the chi he had been building while he waited for the perfect moment. This was the perfect moment. The blast of chi hit the three on stage full on. There was a soundless whump throughout the club that knocked almost alll the patrons off their feet. There was the sound of shattering glass as the windows to the club blew outwards. Without even waiting to see what affect it had on the dancers, Hikaru threw a second and then a third powerful blast of chi. His energy spent, Hikaru dropped his hands and looked to see the results of his handiwork.</p><p>End chapter 7</p><p>Author's notes: Heheheh a cliff hanger. It's been a while since I did that. Thanks again for all the wonderful reviews. A note to Wharpt. Well sort of. Originally the two young men were Hiroshi and Daisuke I had to change it since those two young men would have been sure to know that Miss Nodoka was Ranma's mom and I don't think they'd be that brave.</p>
