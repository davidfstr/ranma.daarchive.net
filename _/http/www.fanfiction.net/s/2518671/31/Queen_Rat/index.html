</div><p>Chapter 5</p><p>'Back to square one'</p><p>Akane looked up when the doorbell to the Tendo home rang . "I got it." Akane stood and walked over to the front door and opened it to reveal a forelorn looking Kodachi Kuno. "Wait a moment." Akane said. She turned away leaving Kodachi standing there. Akane returned a couple minutes later with a manila envelope. "Here you go." She said handing the envelope to Kodachi. Akane started to close the door.</p><p>"Wait." Kodachi choked out. The door swung back open. "That's it?" Kodachi said in disbelief. "No revenge? No gloating? Just here you go and goodbye?"</p><p>"Revenge?" Purred Akane. "Gloating?" Akane smiled coldly. "That would require me caring and I don't."</p><p>"Who's at the door sugar?' Came Ukyo's voice. "Oh it's Kodachi." Ukyo tilted her head. "Didn't you give her the envelope." Akane nodded. "Then why are you still here?" Ukyo asked Kodachi.</p><p>Kodachi looked down. "I don't know." She whispered. "I hoped, I hoped." Kodachi sank to her knees in front of Akane. "Please." She said in the same whisper.</p><p>"Don't like it when you're on the receiving end, huh?" Akane asked. Kodachi shook her head without looking up. Akane sighed. "Oh get up." She said crossly. "And come in." Kodachi stood with a bowed head and shuffled into the house. "Sit." Akane ordered. Kodachi sat.</p><p>"What are we going to do with you Kodachi?" Akane asked. "You can't expect us to like you after everything that you've done?" Kodachi nodded sadly. Akane rolled her eyes. "what's to stop you from becoming a pain in the ass again?" Kodachi extended the envelope.</p><p>"Take it." She said hoarsely. "take it back."</p><p>"Oh no." Akane said. "You don't get off that easily. The first thing you're going to do is apologize to my father, personally. Is that understood?"</p><p>If it were possible, Kodachi's pale face got even paler. "Yes." She whispered.</p><p>"I'd say make her dance but she'd probably enjoy it." Ukyo grumbled. "Besides it would just stroke her ego."</p><p>"Why?" Akane asked. "Do you actually think she'd win on amatuer night?"</p><p>"Honestly? Yeah I do." Ukyo replied.</p><p>Kodachi looked up nervously. "Dance?" She licked her lips. "Like you do?" She shivered. "All those men, staring." She shivered again. "I-I don't know how you do it." She said. "I don't think I could be so brave." She looked down. "Do you really think I would win?"</p><p>"Told you." Ukyo smirked. She stood. "Who, besides me, wants a drink?"</p><p>"Make me whatever you're having." Akane said.</p><p>Ukyo nodded. "Kodachi?"</p><p>Kodachi looked up. "Please." She said fervently.</p><p>Ukyo snorted and went into the kitchen. She returned a few minutes later with three tumblers and a bowl of crackers. She placed a drink in Kodachi's hand and sat down next to Akane. "Did you tell her the rest?" She asked.</p><p>Akane shook her head. "Waited for you." She smirked at the sound of coughing that came from Kodachi. "Too strong?" She asked sweetly."It helps not to gulp."</p><p>"I'll remember for next time." Wheezed Kodachi.</p><p>"We have one more task for you." Akane said after she took a sip. "Good thing for you there is someone who I am even more pissed at than you." Akane took another sip. "And you're going to help me get a little revenge."</p><p>"What could have been worse than what I did?" Kodachi asked with a touch of her old arrogance. "I can't believe I just said that." She said when she realized that very thing. "Sorry."</p><p>Akane shook her head and rolled her eyes. "Konatsu was right, there really is a human being hiding under there." Akane took another sip. "If you think you were humiliated wait until I tell you what we're going to do to Ryoga."</p><p>"Ryoga?" Kodachi said in confusion. "I-I thought Ryoga."</p><p>"Ever hear of Jusenkyo?" Akane interrupted. A sour smile came to Akane's face when Kodachi shook her head. "Wait a minute." Akane walked over to the window. "Ranma." She shouted. "Get down here." A minute later Ranma, in male form, swung through the window.</p><p>"Is the rich bitch gone?" He asked as he entered. "Oh hello Kodachi." He looked at Akane. "I thought, oh never mind, what's up?"</p><p>"Just stand there Ranma." Akane said. "Tell me something Kodachi; who is the pigtailed girl?"</p><p>Kodachi's face turned sour. "Her?" Kodachi's voice dripped with scorn. "I know she dances with you and sometimes stays here but," She stopped at Akane's raised hand. "What?"</p><p>"I don't believe it." Ranma said in disgust.</p><p>"She really doesn't know." Ukyo said in amazed tones. "Oh this is going to be fun." She smiled. "Don't do anything until I get back." She ran off to the kitchen. There was silence and then the sound of poppiing.</p><p>"What is going on?" Kodachi half demanded half begged.</p><p>"Ukyo's making popcorn." Ranma said innocently.</p><p>"I don't mean that." Kodachi said in annoyance."I mean; what don't I know?"</p><p>"Let's wait for Ukyo." Akane gave Ranma a look. She rolled her eyes at Ranma's snicker. "You know Ranma; one day someone is not going to be taken in by your little 'dummy'' act."</p><p>"Hasn't happened yet." Ranma replied with a smirk. The door of the kitchen opened and Ukyo walked out holding a tray. On it was a large bowl of popcorn, a tea kettle and a bottle of water. "It's show time." Ranma turned to Kodachi. "Come here Kodachi." As Kodachi approached Ranma pulled off his shirt leaving him bare-chested in front of the gymnast.</p><p>"He is such a slut." Ukyo said in an aside to Akane. Akane nodded sourly.</p><p>"Put your hands on my chest." Ranma ordered Kodachi. He smiled down at Kodachi as she hesitantly complied. "Now keep them there." He said. "Uk-chan if you would do the honors." Ukyo walked over with the water bottle and poured the water over Ranma's head.</p><p>Kodachi watched Ranma shrink while the hard pectorals under her hands seemed to soften and grow. Next thing Kodachi knew her hands were holding the large breasts of a very familiar redhead. "Ranko." She said. Kodachi passed out from shock.</p><p>Kodachi opened her eyes. She was lying on a couch. "What a horrible dream." She said to herself. "Ranma turned into that hussy Ranko." Kodachi laughed in relief. "Hussy?" Came an annoyed voice. She sat up."Eep." She squeaked. Looking at her from the foot of the couch was Ukyo, Akane and, Kodachi swallowed nervously, Ranko. "It was real?" She whispered.</p><p>"It was real." Akane said. She sat on the arm of the couch. "That's what we meant about Jusenkyo. Ranma's been there and so has Ryoga."</p><p>"Ryoga turns into a girl?" Kodachi asked in disbelief.</p><p>"No." Akane replied. "A pig."</p><p>"A." Kodachi said slowly. "Pig." Akane, Ukyo and Ranma nodded. Kodachi stood up. "Where's your bathroom?" She asked in a faint voice. "I think I'm going to be sick." She ran off in the direction Ukyo pointed.</p><p>"I thought she took that rather well." Ranma said.</p><p>It was nearly fifteen minutes before Kodachi returned. She walked somewhat shakily to the couch. "I hope you don't mind but I used some of your mouthwash." She said as she sat down. "A pig." She muttered.</p><p>"He only turns into a pig." Ranma said in mild complaint. "He isn't really a pig."</p><p>"Just like you're not really a girl?" Akane asked sweetly.</p><p>"Ya think?" Ranma shrugged. "Well Pig Boy does make some interesting sounds when he's excited." He looked at Kodachi. "Sorry Kodachi." He said in true apology.</p><p>Kodachi waved her hand in dismissal. "I'm surprised you haven't made more jokes at my expense." She said. "But thank you." She looked at Akane. "Does he really act like a girl?"</p><p>"It's no act." Akanre replied with a wry grin.</p><p>"I see." Kodachi blew out a breath. "What did you have in mind?" She asked. "For your revenge, I mean."</p><p>"We thought we'd pull a little bait and switch." Akane replied with a cold smile. "You, well you and Ting Li," She waved a hand. "You'll meet Ting Li later, anyway you and Ting Li are going to set Ryoga up." Her smile widened. "And Konatsu will knock him down." Ranma and Ukyo snickered in unison.</p><p>"Does Konatsu know about this?" Kodachi asked. "I really wouldn't like," Kodachi stopped. "He was very kind to me." She finished.</p><p>"That's Konatsu." Ukyo said. "Don't worry sugar, Konatsu volunteered." She snickered. "Volunteered hah, it was his idea."</p><p>That night Kodachi found herself at dinner with the Tendo's. To her surprise there were several additional guests. Nabiki came with Tatewaki and Kimi. Kodachi had half expected them. Kasumi was there of course and where Kasumi was Dr. Tofu was sure to follow. Joining the dinner was Nodoka and Genma Saotome and, to her surprise and relief, Konatsu Kanzen. With Ranma, Akane and Ukyo already there the house was crowded. Soun was beside himself with joy that all his children were there. Kodachi almost bolted the house in panic had Konatsu not stopped her.</p><p>"You have to do this girlfriend." Konatsu said firmly.</p><p>"I can't." Kodachi said anxiously.</p><p>"You must." Konatsu replied. "Why do you think you got off so easily?" The transvestite ninja said seriously. "For your own sake as well as Mr. Tendo's you must." Konatsu led Kodachi back to the main room where everyone was just sitting down to eat. The smells emanating from the kitchen where Nodoka, Kasumi and Ukyo were all busy cooking had all the attendees, but one, waited impatiently. Konatsu gently pressed Kodachi down to sit.</p><p>"Ah Sister. I see you decided to join us." Tatewaki said. "Isn't it good of Mr. Tendo to invite us to dinner?" He turned to Soun. "I hope you don't mind but I took the liberty of bringing some of my families private vintage. Nabiki tells me you enjoy a good wine."</p><p>"That is so kind of you Son." Soun replied.</p><p>"Thank you sir." Tatewaki said. "I just hope the wine will be a suitable match for what, if my nose is not lying, is going to be a truly memorable dinner." He smiled. "It is humbling, is it not, to know that three of the finest chefs in Japan are working together in your kitchen?"</p><p>"That's no lie." Nabiki said cheerfully. She looked across Tatewaki to Kimi. "You ever watch Iron Chef?' She asked. Kimi nodded. "That's nothing compared to what's probably been happening in there for the last hour or so."</p><p>"Oh come on you two." Kimi said in amusement. "I'm sure they're good and all that but," At that moment the door to the kitchen opened and Kimi found her mouth suddenly watering from the aroma that erupted from the kitchen. "On second thought, maybe I spoke too soon." She said. "If the food tastes half as good as it smells." Kimi watched in awe as Ukyo, then Kasumi and finally Nodoka emerged from the kitchen each one carrying a tray.</p><p>The three cooks had obviously competed against each other in friendly rivalry as each dish not only smelled appetizing but had been carefully and artistically plated to maximize the visual impact of each dish. Even the nervous and morose Kodachi seemed to forget her worries as the dishes were placed on the large dining table.</p><p>The three cooks took their places at the table and looked at Soun expectantly. With an obvious effort, Soun took his eyes off the food and bowed to the table followed by the rest of the assembled diners. "Thank you for the food." Soun intoned sonorously and thankfully, then straightened. Soun chuckled. "Everything looks so good I almost hate to touch it." He said. "Don't you think so Genma?" Soun turned as there was no reply. "Genma?"</p><p>"I think Pops is too stunned to say anything." Ranma said in amusement.</p><p>"That's a first." Akane smirked. She raised a plate. "Well let's not let the food get cold." She said. "I want some of everything."</p><p>Kodachi was a veteran of many a feast prepared by some of the finest and most famous chefs in Japan and even she was overwhelmed by the calibre of culinary wizardry displayed. The meal was so elegantly prepared that it overcame her nervousness and she found herself reaching for seconds before she stopped herself. She did, however, gravitate toward the wines that Tatewaki had provided. 'Maybe if I get really, really drunk.' Kodachi thought moodily. She sighed. 'Coward.' She scolded herself.</p><p>Finally the interminable meal ended and the diners with sighs of repletion pushed their plates away. Kodachi stood. "Please let me clear the table." She said hurriedly. Before anyone could protest she started clumsily stacking dishes and bringing them to the kitchen. "You are only putting off the inevitable, Kodachi Kuno." She muttered as she washed the dishes. She stacked the last plate and sighed. With a sense of doom Kodachi exited the kitchen. She walked into the main part of the house and spotted Akane sitting talking quietly to Ukyo and Ranma. "Excuse me." She said to Akane. "Where may I find your father, there is something I must say to him." Kodachi spotted Soun on the porch playing Shogi with Genma. "Nevermind." She sighed. "I see him."</p><p>Kodachi walked toward the two men. To her chagrin Nodoka was also there sitting quietly next to Genma and drinking tea. To Kodachi the short walk seemed endless. As she approached Nodoka looked up. By the expression on the older woman's face, Kodachi surmised that Nodoka already knew. Swallowing a lump in her throat Kodachi knelt down. "Mr. Tendo?" Kodachi began. "There is something you must know." She bowed until her head touched the floor. "I-I have done an evil thing to you." Kodachi swallowed again.</p><p>"Evil?' Soun's voice was puzzled.</p><p>"Evil." Kodachi said faintly. "There is no other word that applies." She said. "Please let me say this, before I lose my nerve." She pleaded. "It was I who started the rumors against your daughter. I was I who sent you the pictures."</p><p>"You?" Soun's voice vibrated with anger. "Why? Why would you do such a thing?"</p><p>"She did it out of a misplaced sense of loyalty to me." Tatewaki's voice came from behind her. "I say this not as an exuse but as an explanation." Tatewaki bowed deeply. "As the current head of the Kuno family, I offer our sincerest apology."</p><p>"No brother, this crime, this sin, is my own." Kodachi said. "Please Mr. Tendo, do not blame the Kunos for my actions and especially do not blame my brother." Kodachi swallowed. "I believed, foolishly, that his association with your daughter was beneath him." Kodachi seemed to tremble. "As I believed his relationship with Kimi Ota was beneath him."</p><p>"His relationship with Kimi?" Soun asked in confusion.</p><p>"Later Soun." Nodoka interrupted. "And Konatsu, you hurt him as well." Nodoka said heatedly.</p><p>Kodachi nodded from her kneeling position. "To my shame, I did that with no regard to his feelings, just to sow confusion. I believed no one would care because of what he was."</p><p>"Konatsu is a lot of things." Ukyo's voice came from behind Kodachi. "But he is also our friend." There was a near growl to her voice. "We cared."</p><p>"It's okay Miss Ukyo." Konatsu said quickly. "Kodachi is my friend too."</p><p>"You're too forgiving Konatsu." Ukyo said.</p><p>"Yes he is." Agreed Kodachi. "To my everlasting shame, with one act of kindness, he showed me my true self." Kodachi's voice became quieter as she spoke. "I found I didn't like what I saw."</p><p>"Remind me to apologize to Konatsu for all the times I called him a flake." Ranma whispered to Akane. Akane nodded. "same here." She whispered back. "Daddy." Akane said in a louder voice. "We've already punished Kodachi for what she did to Nabiki, Kimi and Konatsu." She said. "But not for what she did to you."</p><p>Soun looked down at the still bowed Kodachi. "Look at me girl." He growled. Kodachi looked up and Soun could see the fear in her eyes. "You've caused us a lot of pain." Kodachi nodded mutely. "Nabiki." He said without taking his eyes off of Kodachi. "You brought her here knowing she was going to confess, didn't you?"</p><p>"Yes daddy and to accept her fate." Nabiki said firmly. "My only hope is that you spare the Kuno name," Nabiki smiled wryly. "It's going to be mine after all, you know."</p><p>"Nabiki!" Squealed Nodoka. "Do you mean?" Nodoka fanned herself. "Oh my." Despite her happiness Nodoka spared a quick glance toward Kimi. Nodoka relaxed, the smile on the taller blonds face said it all. "This is wonderful. We must celebrate." She said excitedly. "Kimi will you help me?"</p><p>"Of course Auntie." Kimi replied. She followed Nodoka into the kitchen. "Before you say anything Auntie." Kimi began. "I knew this was going to happen." She chuckled. "Overdue, if you ask me."</p><p>Nodoka bustled around the kitchen assembling something celebratory. "And you dear? What about you?" She asked quietly. "I know how close you and Tatewaki have become." She smiled. "My Lady Kimi, isn't that what he calls you?"</p><p>Kimi blushed. "Well, you know, Tatewaki is a romantic." Kimi shrugged. "Besides didn't the nobility used to have official concubines?"</p><p>"You would accept such a role?" Nodoka asked in a serious tone. "More importantly, will Nabiki offer that role?"</p><p>"If she'll take it." Nabiki's voice came from the doorway. Nabiki walked into the kitchen. "Will you stay with us," Nabiki smiled but there seemed to be a touch of pleading in the smile. "My Lady Kimi?"</p><p>"You know I can't say no to you," Kimi seemed to hesitate for a moment. "My Lady Nabiki."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi sat forlornly in a corner watching the happy bustle all around her. 'You are a fool, Kodachi Kuno.' She thought to herself. 'You could have been part of this.' So engrossed was she that she didn't notice that someone had sat down beside her.<p>"Hey girlfriend." Konatsu greeted the gymnast. "You going to stay in this corner forever?"</p><p>"Oh if only I could." Kodachi said sadly.</p><p>"Oh no, girlfriend." Konatsu said firmly. "You're going to get up and properly congratulate your brother and his intendeds."</p><p>"Intendeds?" Kodachi looked over his shoulder where both Nabiki and Kimi were possessively each holding on to one of Tatewaki's arms. "You don't mean?" Konatsu nodded cheerfully. "I see."</p><p>"Takes all kinds." Konatsu grinned. He stood and reached a manicured hand down. "Coming girlfriend?"</p><p>Kodachi took Konatsu's hand and let the feminine ninja pull her to her feet. With Konatsu's hand firmly on her elbow, Kodachi let herself be guided over to where Tatewaki was speaking with Nodoka. Kodachi approached with bowed head. "Brother?"</p><p>"Sister." Tatewaki replied gravely.</p><p>"I-I hope you will permit me to offer my congratulations." Kodachi said hesitantly. "The House of Kuno is graced," Kodachi swallowed. "By the presence of the Ladies Tendo and Ota." She bowed.</p><p>"Thank you Sister." Tatewaki said in almost warm tones. "You don't know how much your good wishes mean to me."</p><p>'No I don't.' Kodachi thought somberly. "I wondered, how do you wish this announced?" Kodachi chewed her lower lip nervously. "D-did you wish a formal announcement and attendant ball? It would be the proper thing to do."</p><p>"Ball?" Nabiki smiled. "A Ball. What a lovely idea. Auntie." Nabiki called to Nodoka. "Kodachi just proposed a Ball to announce the engagement. What do you think?"</p><p>"Well of course we going to have a Ball." Nodoka said impatiently. She looked at Kodachi. "So, you've decided. You and I will speak, later." She said firmly. Kodachi nodded rapidly. "Tatewaki Kuno is, was, the most eligible bachelor in Tokyo. You're engagement will be News."</p><p>"I thought of calling a couple of the better Society writers for a private announcement. That way we can maintain as much control over what gets reported as possible." Kodachi added. Nodoka nodded approvingly. "Forgive me, but what will be a, how do you?" Kodachi gestured helplessly at Kimi. "What do you want to say?"</p><p>"You will say that Tatewaki Kuno, blah, blah, blah announced his engagement to Nabiki Tendo, blah, blah, blah and that they wish to further announce that their longtime companion Kimi Ota is being adopted as Nabiki Kuno's Sister, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You fill in the blanks." Nabiki ordered, and it was an order, Kodachi realized.</p><p>"Yes Lady Tendo." Kodachi replied. "And for the official portrait?"</p><p>"Ah yes, the portrait." Nabiki smiled. "I assume you can get in touch with Gos." Nabiki's smile was cold. "Tell him," Nabiki paused. "Tell him the Ice Queen wishes his presence." She leaned forward. "Make sure he understand what that mean. Gos was always a bit of an idiot." Nabiki nodded. "That and making sure my Baby Sister takes Ryoga down a peg should keep you busy." Nabiki paused. "Oh and a small dinner for some business associates. You will make sure they're," Nabiki suddenly smiled evilly. "Happy."</p><p>End Chapter 5</p><p>Author's Notes; Well I received several emails telling me St Fan is updating again. I haven't sent anything to him yet it's been busy. On a sad note: A very popular and influential musician in the Bay Area Folkloric community died last week. His name was Carlos Acietuno and he was 46 years old. Among other things he was a master drummer, dancer and Mestre Capoeira. Anyone who has been to and seen San Francisco's Carnaval is sure to remember Fogo Na Roupa with its huge bateria and even larger dancers contingent.</p><p>Over the weekend several hundred of us got together and remembered Carlos in the only way possible. The drummers drummed and the dancers danced. We even took the music to the streets. A good send off i thought.</p>
