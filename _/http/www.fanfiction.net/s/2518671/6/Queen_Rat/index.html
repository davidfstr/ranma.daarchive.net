</div><p><b>Chapter 6</b></p><p>'<b>Visiting Day 2'</b></p><p><b>Kimi returned to her cell two days later. She was still sore but was mending quickly. Especially since Nabiki insisted on rubbing analgesic cream on her regularly, courtesy of a midnight run by Ranma and Akane, and feeding her meals that did not come from the prison kitchen. Again courtesy of several midnight runs. </b></p><p><b>Kimi was resting on the lower bunk. Nabiki sat on the floor next to her reading a magazine. Kimi's hand played with Nabiki's hair. "You know, if it wasn't for the fact we're in prison, I think I'd be very content to stay like this."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki snorted. "You just like being waited on hand and foot."</b></p><p>"<b>Well yeah." Kimi grinned. "Who wouldn't?" Kimi rolled over. "How come you're not in the hole?"</b></p><p>"<b>Yasuhara decided to overlook it." Nabiki replied. "For a price."</b></p><p><b>Kimi grimaced. "How much did she want?" Kimi asked.</b></p><p><b>Nabiki gave a lopsided smile. "Ten percent." She replied. "Plus we have to break a drug smuggling ring."</b></p><p><b>Kimi was quiet for awhile as she digested Nabiki's information. "You realize of course," She said a little later. "That it's one of the guards."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki frowned and nodded. "Yeah. I figured that had to be the case." She took Kimi's hand. "It could get rough." She said. "I think I could get you transferred to another cell."</b></p><p>"<b>Uh. Uh." Kimi replied firmly. "You need me." She said. "To watch your back."</b></p><p>"<b>It's not my back I'm worried about." Nabiki replied in a voice touched with concern. "Satoh proved that any friend of mine can and will be a target."</b></p><p>"<b>Then we'll just have to be more alert." Kimi replied. She pulled Nabiki's hand to her cheek. "I owe you, Nabs." She said seriously. "For a lot of things." She snorted. "I never had a really good friend before." She said. "I'd like to keep her around for a bit longer." Kimi lay back against the bed. "Wouldn't you do the same?" She yawned. "Sorry."</b></p><p><b>Nibiki smiled slightly. "Yeah," She replied. "Get some rest Kimi. You're going to need it once the shit hits the fan."</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>Prisoner Tendo Ranko, report to the visitors area. Prisoner Tendo Ranko, report to the visitors area." Blared over the prison public address system. Ranma's eye brows lifted in surprise. "Just me?" She said. "I wonder who it is." She turned her head. "Tomboy?"</b><p>"<b>Go ahead Ranko." Akane replied. "I think I can handle everything here." She and Ranma had been standing outside of Nabiki's cell while Nabiki and Kimi conducted various business transactions. They were there mostly to make sure there weren't too many people crowding Nabiki's cell. Though they occasionally had to break up a few incipient scuffles. The number of problems dropped quickly once it became clear that the 'Tendo Gang' as they were now being referred to, didn't take crap from anyone. Akane found she could get someone's attention by the simple expedient of lifting the person one handed and hold them dangling over the railing.</b></p><p>"<b>Thanks." Ranma raced off. Since their cells were on the second floor it didn't take Ranma long to get to the guard station leading to the visitors area. She quickly announced herself and was let into the visitation area. She looked at the person waiting for her. A big grin appeared on Ranma's face. "Ukyo!" She said happily. "I didn't expect you until next week."</b></p><p><b>Ukyo smiled back. "Complaining?" She said teasingly.</b></p><p>"<b>Never Uk-chan." Ranma replied. "You know I'm always happy to see ya." Ranma leaned closer to the transparent divider. "What's up?"</b></p><p><b>Ukyo matched Ranma's posture. "Ah, the grill needed some repair so I thought I'd come see you." Ukyo sighed. "They still won't let me send you an okonomiyaki." She snorted. "What are they expecting, a file under the toppings?"</b></p><p><b>Ranma laughed. "Probably." Ranma sighed happily. 'She's looking better.' Ranma tilted her head. "Anyway it's good to see ya."</b></p><p>"<b>Actually something came up that I wanted to talk to you about." Ukyo shrugged. "It may be nothing but I overheard a couple customers talking." Ukyo leaned forward. "They were talking about the prison." </b></p><p><b>Ranma raised an eyebrow then raised a hand to stop Ukyo. She looked around. "When are you planning to go back home?" She asked.</b></p><p>"<b>Tonight. Why?"</b></p><p>"<b>There's this motel a couple miles east of here, kinda cheap looking, but it's got this great all night ramen shop with a big red umbrella painted on the side." Ranma stood. "Thank for coming by Uk-chan." She smiled. "See ya later."</b></p><p><b>Ukyo grinned. "Later sugar."</b></p><p><b>Ranma made her way back to where her cell was. Akane was still leaning against one wall while Nabiki and Kimi conducted business in the cell. Akane looked up as Ranma approached. "It was Ukyo." Ranma said immediately. "Seems she heard something that we may find interesting." Ranma grinned. "Wanna go for a midnight run?"</b></p><p>"<b>To see Ukyo?" Akane asked. Ranma nodded. To Ranma's surprise Akane walked over and gave Ranma a kiss on the cheek. </b></p><p>"<b>What was that for?" Ranma asked. "Not that I'm complaining you understand."</b></p><p>"<b>You could have snuck out without telling me." Akane replied. She smiled wryly. "You've done it before."</b></p><p><b>Ranma opened her mouth to protest and closed it with a click. "Yeah, you're right." She shook her head. "I did." Ranma sighed. "Come with me Tomboy."</b></p><p>"<b>Don't trust yourself?" Ranma looked down and then shook her head slightly. Akane patted Ranma on the cheek. "We'll go see Ukyo."</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ukyo looked at the clock on the wall. '1 a.m.' She thought. Ukyo was dressed in her most masculine garb and looked more like a boy than usual. She shrugged and turned back to the chef. The chef and owner of the Ramen shop and Ukyo had spent the last hour talking shop. An all night restaurant wasn't all that rare. Especially in Tokyo. Ukyo and the chef had been comparing notes in regards to running a restaurant.</b><p><b>The bell over the door tinkled. Ukyo turned. She grinned when Ranma walked in. When Akane walked in behind the red head, Ukyo's grin dimmed for a second then turned wry. 'Well it was a nice fantasy.' She waved. "Hey guys." A minute later the three were seated at a corner table. The table had a curved bench along one side and the three squeezed in with Ranma in the middle.</b></p><p>"<b>Looking good Uk-chan." Ranma said. "Ow." She rubbed her side where Akane jabbed her with her elbow.</b></p><p>"<b>Wipe you mouth Ranma." Akane said. "You're drooling." She gave Ukyo a slight glare. "That's cheating Ukyo."Akane said in annoyance. "I thought we had an understanding." </b></p><p>"<b>Oh we do." Ukyo replied. She and Akane exchanged looks that threatened to escalate into outright glares.</b></p><p>"<b>Can we please get back to reason we came here." Pleaded Ranma.</b></p><p>"<b>You're right Ran-chan." Ukyo broke the staring match with Akane. Ukyo took a deep breath and calmed herself with some effort. "Now's not the time."</b></p><p>"<b>Ranma said you heard something we might find interesting." Akane said after she got herself under control. </b></p><p><b>Ukyo nodded. "A couple nights ago I had a couple customers. There was something about them so I kept a close watch." Ukyo began. "I had Konatsu keep them supplied with Sake." Ukyo grinned. "'Natsu made a ton in tips." She said. "Anyway Konatsu kept his ears open and he overheard them mention the prison." Ukyo's grin vanished. "They also mentioned drugs." Her eyebrows rose when both Akane and Ranma nodded. "You knew."</b></p><p>"<b>We heard something." Corrected Akane. "Someone's bringing drugs into the prison. We have to find out who." Akane said. "Anything else?"</b></p><p><b>Ukyo nodded. "Something big is happening soon." Ukyo sat back and crossed her arms. "Something bothers me about this." She said. "Bringing drugs into a prison seems, I don't know, kind of petty. The way these guys were talking." She shrugged. "It doesn't add up."</b></p><p>"<b>Too big?" Asked Akane. Ukyo nodded. "I'll let Nabiki know." Akane stood. "Come on Ranma. It's time to head back."</b></p><p><b>Ranma stood. "Thanks Uk-chan." She said. "You hear anything else, let us know."</b></p><p>"<b>You know I will sugar." Ukyo replied. She looked at Akane. "You make sure you treat Ranma right or you answer to me."</b></p><p>"<b>With you in the wings waiting for me to screw up?" Akane responded easily. "Of course I'll treat her right." The two women exchanged a look. Ukyo nodded. "Later Ukyo." Akane turned and she and Ranma walked out of the restaurant. </b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>I really hate it when the two of you fight over me." Grumped Ranma from the darkness of the cell. "I thought you guys had gotten over it."</b><p><b>Akane sighed. "We have Ranma." Akane replied from the bottom bunk. "That's what Ukyo meant; as long as I treat you right she'll accept," Akane paused. "Us." She said finally. There was another pause. "I am treating you right, aren't I?" Akane said in a small voice.</b></p><p><b>Ranma rolled over and peered downwards into the darkness. "Of course you are Tomboy." She replied. "You know that."</b></p><p>"<b>Sometimes I'm not so sure." Akane replied. "I saw the look on your face when you saw Ukyo."</b></p><p>"<b>Akane?"</b></p><p>"<b>She makes a very convincing boy doesn't she?" Akane said softly.</b></p><p>"<b>What's that got to do with anything?" Ranma's voice cracked in annoyance.</b></p><p>"<b>Don't pretend Ranma." Akane's voice remained soft. "That's why Ukyo dressed the way she did. She knows just like I know." There was a rustle as Akane shifted in the bunk. "In a way it was a challenge to me, she was letting me know she knows."</b></p><p>"<b>Know what?" Ranma asked nervously.</b></p><p>"<b>You're very different when you're a girl." Akane's voice was soft. "It took me a long time," Akane paused. "No, I think I knew from the beginning. I just didn't want to accept it." Akane sighed. "I love you Ranma. Boy or girl, I love you. I want you to know that."</b></p><p><b>Ranma rolled over on to her back. She didn't speak for so long Akane thought she might have fallen asleep. "I-I like girls."</b></p><p>"<b>I know you do Ranma." Akane replied in the same soft voice. "No one is saying you don't." Akane smiled in the darkness. "You're a very good lover you know." She said. "You know exactly what a girl likes." Akane paused. "You slept with Ukyo, didn't you?"</b></p><p>"<b>Akane!" Protested Ranma.</b></p><p>"<b>It's okay Ranma." Akane said quickly. "I'm not mad. Not really. I wasn't very good to you in the beginning. And Ukyo does love you." Akane pillowed her head on her arms. "She'd treat you right." Akane said. "She'd have no problem acting like a boy around you." Akane swallowed nervously. "She'd give you what you needed." Akane paused but Ranma remained silent. "I-I'll give you what you need too." She said finally.</b></p><p>"<b>What do you think I need?" Ranma husked. "A man?" The last said angrily.</b></p><p>'<b>Careful Akane.' She told herself. "No Ranma, I don't think that's what you need." Akane replied. "Not exactly. But you do need to be treated like a girl sometimes. I didn't realize that." Akane's voice dropped to almost a whisper. "I realize that now and, and I don't mind."</b></p><p>"<b>But do you like it?" Ranma's voice matched Akane's. "You called me pervert enough times."</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah, I did and I'm sorry." Akane replied. "And yes, I do like it. Heaven help me, but I like it a lot." Akane could hear Ranma roll over in the top bunk. "Boy or girl Ranma, boy or girl."</b></p><p><b>Ranma was silent for a time. "What's it like?" she asked finally.</b></p><p><b>Akane smiled in relief. "Really nice baby." Akane replied. "Did you like it when I used my fingers?" Akane's smile widened. 'My, my I think I HEARD Ranma blush.' She thought. "Well it's even better."</b></p><p>"<b>Yeah?"</b></p><p>"<b>You'll see." Akane replied. "Once I figure out how, that is." Akane was rewarded with hearing Ranma laugh. "I love you Ranma."</b></p><p>"<b>I love you too, Tomboy." Ranma said. "Can I get another good night kiss?"</b></p><p>"<b>Any time baby." Akane replied. She grinned. "My bunk or yours?"</b></p><b><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki and Kimi were in their cell working on their next 'shopping list' when there was a knock on the cell door. The door opened and Ranma stuck her head in. "Hey Nabs." Ranma said. "You have a visitor. Says she has something you may find interesting."</b><p>"<b>Who is it?" Nabiki asked.</b></p><p>"<b>She says her name is Koemi Asahi." Ranma replied.</b></p><p>"<b>Petty thief." Kimi said to Nabiki. "She's serving a two to five sentence." Kimi shrugged. "I haven't heard anything really bad about her."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki nodded. She turned to Ranma. "Okay let her in."</b></p><p><b>Ranma pulled her head from the doorway. The door opened wider and an older woman in her mid forties walked in. Nabiki noted how quietly the woman walked. Nabiki nodded to the bunk. "Have a seat Ms. Asahi." Once the woman sat Nabiki leaned over and picked up a box sitting on the floor next to her chair. "Chocolate?"</b></p><p><b>The older woman smiled. Her hand hovered over the box as she considered her selection. Finally she picked a candy and popped it into her mouth. A blissful smile came to her face. "Oh that's good." She said finally. </b></p><p>"<b>So Ms. Asahi." Nabiki said. "Ranko says you have something?"</b></p><p><b>The woman nodded. "I hear you're interested in the prison drug trade." She said. Koemi Asahi tilted her head. "Funny you don't look like a user." She observed.</b></p><p>"<b>I'm not." Nabiki replied. "And if that's what you're selling you can leave now."</b></p><p>"<b>No. No. No." The woman waved her hands in denial. "Just checking. Never touch the stuff myself." The woman leaned forward in the bunk. "Did you know that your friend Satoh was one of the main suppliers?"</b></p><p><b>Nabiki extended the box of chocolates. "No I didn't." Nabiki replied. "Go on."</b></p><p><b>The woman nodded again. "Well she was." She waved a hand. "You'd think it would take awhile before someone else took up the slack wouldn't you?"</b></p><p>"<b>Go on." Nabiki repeated.</b></p><p>"<b>Well apparently there is a new supplier." Koemi replied.</b></p><p>"<b>A name." Kimi said urgently. "Do you have a name?"</b></p><p>"<b>No name." Koemi replied. "But it appears that most of the activity is centered around the fourth floor." She grinned. "Cell 207 to be exact." Her grin got wider when Nabiki extended the chocolate box once again. "Thought you'd like that."</b></p><p><b>Nabiki and Kimi exchanged a look. Nabiki turned back to Koemi. "So Koemi." Nabiki said. "What can I do for you?"</b></p><p><b>Koemi rubbed the back of her head. A sheepish smile came to her face. "I was wondering." She said slowly. "Do you take special orders?"</b></p><p>"<b>No drugs, no booze, no cigarettes." Nabiki replied. She shrugged. "Other than that. It's a matter of time and money."</b></p><p><b>Ranma looked up from where she was leaning against the wall as a peal of laughter came from Nabiki's cell. A minute later the cell door opened and a smiling Koemi Asahi walked out. "Thanks again." She called into the cell and walked away. Ranma watched the older woman almost skip as she left. Ranma walked into the cell.</b></p><p>"<b>Good information?" She asked.</b></p><p>"<b>Possibly." Nabiki replied. "I want you and Akane to pay a visit to cell 207." Nabiki's smile was cold. "Drugs." She said.</b></p><p>"<b>Consider it handled." Ranma replied confidently. "We'll do it tonight." Ranma grinned. "The Tomboy needs to practice not being seen."</b></p><p>"<b>Good." Nabiki replied. "Have fun." She waved Ranma off. After Ranma left Nabiki turned to Kimi. "Now any ideas about how to fill our special order?"</b></p><p>"<b>Not yet." Kimi grinned. "You know, I'm surprised I didn't think of it earlier." She shook her head in amusement. "I have a feeling it's going to be a very popular item." She laughed. "Think I should get one for us?" Her laughter increased as Nabiki blushed. "Thought so."</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>There it is again." Omura all but shouted. She pointed to her monitor. "I think the damn prison is haunted." She scanned the bank of telltales arrayed before her. "All the cells are locked down." She said. "No wait." She pointed to a light that started to blink in red. "Cell 207." She said as she read the number. She picked up a nightstick and a flashlight. "Come on." She said to her partner.</b><p><b>The two female guards hurried to the doorway that led to the prison proper. "We're heading for the fourth floor." Omura informed the guard on duty. "My monitor says a cell just opened. We're going to take a look." She shrugged. "It may be nothing but the book says to look."</b></p><p><b>The other guard nodded. "Make sure you check in regular like." She admonished. "Don't be afraid to press the panic button."</b></p><p><b>Omura nodded. She and her partner hurried through the opened door to the prison. The two female guards walked quickly toward an elevator and let it take them to the fourth floor. Total quiet greeted them as they walked down the causeway. Suddenly they halted. The door to cell 207 was slightly ajar. "By the numbers partner." Omura hissed. The other guard nodded.</b></p><p><b>The two guards flattened against the wall and sidled over to the open door. Omura looked in. "Shit." She hissed. The cell looked like a cyclone had passed through it. The two occupants were lying on the floor. That was unusual enough. What was more unusual was the fact that the two women in the cell had also been tied up with their own bed sheets. A large bow sealed the sheets around each woman. Several plastic bags were placed on top of each woman. The bags had little bows attached to them.</b></p><p><b>Omura quickly walked over to one of the bound women and picked up a plastic bag and looked at it. "Oh my." She said in glee. She handed the bag to her partner. "If this isn't crack, I'll turn in my badge." The woman nearly dropped the bag when a peal of laughter echoed through the prison.</b></p><p>"<b>Did you hear that?" The guard asked nervously.</b></p><p><b>Omura grinned. "Nope." She replied. "And neither did you." Omura threw a salute into the darkness. "Have a good evening Casper." She said quietly.</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>You wanted to see me Warden?" Sargent Yasuhara said.</b><p><b>The warden smiled. At least that's what Yasuhara assumed that was the expression on the man's face. It was hard to tell. "Relax Yasuhara." He pointed to a chair. "Have a seat." The warden straightened some papers on his desk. "You heard about the bust last night I assume?" Yasuhara nodded. "Lab analysis confirms Omura's guess."</b></p><p>"<b>The question is; how did it get in here?" Yasuhara replied "It has to be an inside job."</b></p><p>"<b>I agree." The warden ran his hand over his thinning hair. "My problem is; who am I going to trust to break the ring?" The warden grimaced. "You don't have the cleanest record Yasuhara." The warden chuckled sourly. "And it's for that reason that I think I can trust you."</b></p><p>"<b>I think you can trust Omura as well." Yasuhara replied easily. "I can work with her."</b></p><p>"<b>I'm already ahead of you." The warden replied seriously. "She's being assigned to you." Yasuhara grunted in approval. "Have your inside sources given you any new information?"</b></p><p><b>Yasuhara raised a hand and waggled it. "Only that they think something big is about to come down. When, where and how." Yasuhara shrugged. She gave the warden an inquiring look. "You haven't asked who they are."</b></p><p>"<b>You noticed." The warden's expression became, if possible, even sourer. "I don't want to know." He said. "I didn't want you wondering if it's me." The warden picked up the papers on his desk and straightened them even further. "Dismissed."</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"<b>Do that last sequence again, Sarge." Ranma said. "It was sloppy." Ranma watched as Yasuhara went through one of the more complex Saotome/Tendo katas. 'She's not too bad.' Ranma conceded. 'But she needs to loosen up more.' Ranma turned. "Hey Tomboy."</b><p>"<b>Yes Ranko?" Akane trotted over where she was working with a Chinese style wooden practice dummy.</b></p><p>"<b>The Sarge is too stiff." Ranma said. "I want ya to limber her up."</b></p><p>"<b>Stiff?" Protested Yasuhara. "You've got to be joking."</b></p><p>"<b>Ranko's right." Akane said. "You don't stretch enough." Akane grinned evilly. "Don't worry, it won't hurt." Akane's grin got wider. "Much." Akane pointed to the floor. "Lie down." Yasuhara cautiously lowered herself to the floor. Akane took a hold of one of Yasuhara's legs and lifted it. Then she leaned against the guards leg and pressed it towards the woman's chest. She locked her hands around the woman's knee to keep it from bending.</b></p><p>"<b>Eeyah." Sargent Yasuhara bit back on the scream. 'What are you trying to do, rip me in half?" She gasped. </b></p><p>"<b>See? Ranko was right. You're too stiff." Akane commented as she continued to press against the Sargent's leg. She kept the pressure on for nearly a minute before she eased off. "Now the other leg."</b></p><p>"<b>You're gonna let Akane work on ya every day from now on." Ranma said easily. She grinned at Yasuhara's expression. "Having second thoughts?' She asked.</b></p><p><b>Yasuhara gritted her teeth. "No." She grunted.</b></p><p>"<b>No what?" Ranma asked in a suddenly cooler tone.</b></p><p>"<b>No sensei." Yasuhara replied.</b></p><p>"<b>That's better." Ranma replied seriously. "I don't just train anyone you know." The red head pulled at her pig tail. "You got some talent and Mr. Tendo gave ya the basics. But you're sloppy."</b></p><p>"<b>Ranko hates sloppy." Akane added. "Okay done. You can get up now."Akane stepped back and offered a hand to the Sargent. Yasuhara grabbed the hand and Akane pulled her easily to her feet. "I'd soak in a hot bath tonight." Akane said.</b></p><p><b>Yasuhara nodded. "I'm going to need it." She looked at Akane. "You two did good before but our deal was to find out the source."</b></p><p>"<b>We're working on it Sargent." Akane said easily. "Nabiki is looking at the personnel list you gave us. She's trying to cut it down."</b></p><p><b>Yasuhara nodded. "Good."</b></p><p>"<b>Oh I nearly forgot." Akane said. She reached into her prison uniform and extracted an envelope. "Your cut." She said as she handed the envelope to the Sargent. </b></p><p><b>Yasuhara took the envelope and opened it. Her eyes widened as she counted the bills. A grin appeared on her face. "Not bad." She said. "Not bad at all."</b></p><p><b>End Chapter 6</b></p>
