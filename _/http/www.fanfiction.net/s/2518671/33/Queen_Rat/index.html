</div><p>Chapter 7</p><p>'First date'</p><p>Kodachi stood at the entrance of the Kuno mansion as the car drove up. A late model black sportscar. Kodachi admitted a bit of anticipation. "Ky Young Ji." She said to herself. "And here to see me."</p><p>Ky Young Ji opened the car door. Tall, slim but atheletic, in his mid thirties he was at his peak. He smiled as he saw Kodachi standing at the top of the stairs. He walked quickly up the stairs. "Ms. Kuno you didn't need to meet me at the door." He said.</p><p>"Kodachi please Mr. Young Ji." Kodachi replied.</p><p>"Ky." Ky young Ji replied.</p><p>"Ky." Agreed Kodachi. "I was so surprised to hear you were here. You should have called, I might have been out."</p><p>"To be honest, I wasn't sure you'd accept my call." The Korean replied.</p><p>"Why would you think that?" Kodachi asked in surprise. "You are one of my brother's business associates. He would expect me to treat you courteously at the very least."</p><p>"Does being courteous extend to accompanying me to dinner?" Ky Young Ji asked slightly hesitantly. "I wanted to thank you for," He paused. "A lot of things."</p><p>Kodachi raised an eyebrow. "Are you asking me out for a date Ky?" Kodachi frowned suddenly. "I will have to ask my brother." She gave Ky an apologetic look. "My brother has had reason to impose that rule recently."</p><p>Ky Young Ji tried, and failed, to stifle a laugh. "You're grounded?"</p><p>Kodachi pursed her lips in annoyance. "I am not grounded." Kodachi replied. "It's just that my actions are somewhat curtailed at the moment." She crossed her arms as Ky began to laugh. "It's not funny."</p><p>"Yes it is." Ky Young Ji said. "The fearsome Kodachi Kuno, grounded." He smiled at Kodachi. "Come on admit it, it's funny."</p><p>"Oh, well a little." Kodachi said grudgingly. She tilted her head. "Fearsome?" Kodachi took Ky Young Ji's arm and led him into the house. "You think of me as fearsome?"</p><p>"Not me." Ky replied. "But some of the other family heads," he chuckled. "The way you stood up to Noichi caused a lot of comment. Personally, I thought you were magnificient."</p><p>"Truly?" Kodachi stopped when they reached the Library door. "Please wait in here while I speak to my brother." She looked into Ky Young Ji's eyes for a moment then turned and walked away.</p><p>Ky Young Ji watched her depart then walked into the Library. Despite his confident demeanor, Ky was nervous. He was, after all, asking the future sister-in-law of the Ice Queen out. The Ice Queen may value ability over origin but there was no reason to expect her liberal nature to extend so far. "You're just taking her to dinner to thank her." Ky reminded himself. He poured himself a drink from the bar and sat down in a comfortable chair to wait. "Besides she's way too young for you." He told himself firmly. Ky Young Ji turned as he heard the door to the Library open. He paled as he realized it was Tatewaki Kuno. He jumped to his feet. "My Lord Kuno." He said and ducked his head.</p><p>"Ky." Tatewaki said gravely. He waved his hand toward a conversation nook. "Please sit."</p><p>"Yes sir." Ky Young Ji said. 'Damn!' He growled internally. 'You probably are supposed to talk to the brother first.' Ky took his drink and made to sit on a seat off the one side.</p><p>"The couch." Tatewaki said firmly. "What are you drinking?" Tatewaki asked.</p><p>"Scotch." Ky replied. He sat at one end of the large couch. Tatewaki walked over and sat comfortably at the other. "Sir." Ky said hurriedly. "I meant no disrespect." He said. "I just wanted to thank her."</p><p>"Indeed." Tatewaki looked at his drink for a moment before raising it to his mouth for a healthy sip. "And where did you plan to take her?" He asked after he savored the hot sensation the liquor produced.</p><p>"I was going to leave that up to her." Ky replied. 'Okay he hasn't pulled his sword on you. Be honest and respectful.' He ordered himself firmly.</p><p>Tatewaki chuckled. "Never a good idea." He gave Ky an appraising stare. "She likes French." He said conversationally. "I will call the maitre de at La Monde. He will give you my regular table."</p><p>"Yes sir." Ky replied. "Thank you sir."</p><p>"Please stop calling me sir." Tatewaki smiled wryly. "Tatewaki will do." He said. "At least here." He clarified. "Mr. Kuno will be sufficient at other times."</p><p>Ky sat back against the couch a little more comfortably though he remained attentive. "Thank you," Ky replied. "Tatewaki." He smiled as Tatewaki saluted him with his glass. "When should I bring her home?" He asked after a long pause.</p><p>"Now here is where we may have a problem." Tatewaki looked at his glass. "Can you roof hop?"</p><p>Ky blinked. "Excuse me?"</p><p>"Roof hop." Tatewaki said seriously. "Run across the roofs of Nerima. Leap across the gaps between streets." He took another long sip from his drink. "My sister used to run with the Terrible Three. As did I." He looked at Ky. "Though usually for my own selfish reasons."</p><p>"You were N.W.C.?" Ky eyes widened at Tatewaki's nod. "Oh no." He said in sudden realization. "Your sister is the Black Rose." Ky took a healthy slug of his drink. "I didn't put it together until now."</p><p>"Indeed." Tatewaki nodded. "Now you know why I asked if you can roof hop." He looked at Ky. "Well? Can you?</p><p>Ky took a deep breath and then let it out slowly. "No." He admitted. "I know how to fight but I'm not at that level." Ky Young Ji grimaced. "I was hesitant on even taking her dancing." He said.</p><p>Tatewaki laughed. "Truly." He looked up as the Library door opened and Kodachi walked in. "Ah Sister." Tatewaki said. "We were just talking about you."</p><p>Kodachi paled. 'He wouldn't.' She thought worriedly. "And?"</p><p>"I will permit Ky to take you to dinner." Tatewaki replied seriously. "I hope you don't mind but I've had to insist that he take you to La Monde."</p><p>"Thank you Brother." Kodachi said in relief. Then she blushed on how it must have sounded. "I mean." Kodachi stopped and pulled her tattered dignity together. "I will expect you at eight." She told Ky imperiously. "If you'll excuse me. There are things I must do." Kodachi ran off.</p><p>Tatewaki chuckled. "She seemed pleased." He looked at Ky. "There will be observers." Tatewaki informed the other man. "My people."</p><p>"Your," Ky paused. "people." He said finally. 'The rumors are true.' He told himself.</p><p>"They are there for her protection." Tatewaki replied. "Not that she really needs it but," Tatewaki spread his hands in a shrug. "We have enemies."</p><p>Ky Young Ji shrugged. "That I understand." He said. He rose. "Thank you." He said. "I think I'd better go home and change." He looked at his watch. "Plenty of time."</p><p>Tatewaki stood as well. "I'll walk with you to the door." Tatewaki walked quietly besides the Korean. One of the servents opened the door as they approached. "You've impressed me and my Ladies." He told Ky Young Ji. "Else you would not get within ten feet of my sister."</p><p>"I understand that." Ky looked around. "Mr Kuno."</p><p>Tatewaki smiled. "Excellent." Tatewaki said. "Come a little early. Say seven-thirty." Tatewaki said. "You can pay your respects to my ladies."</p><p>"It would be my pleasure." Ky Young Ji bowed respectfully to Tatewaki and walked down the stairs to his car. Ky drove away.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Konatsu watched cheerfully as Nodoka bustled around Kodachi. The older woman seemed to alternate between berating Kodachi for her past actions on one hand while on the other hand she insisted on overseeing what Kodachi was going to wear in order, as she put it, 'make the right impression'. The double whammy of maternal attention overwhelmed the motherless Kodachi.<p>"Are you sure a Kimono is the right thing to wear?" Kodachi said plaintively.</p><p>"It's a beautiful Kimono." Nodoka said firmly. "The colors suit your complexion." Nodoka tightened the sash.</p><p>"Auntie has a point." Konatsu said from his perch on the end of the bed. "It does look good on you." He snickered. "Makes a pretty good chastity belt too."</p><p>"Konatsu." Nodoka said in disapproving tones. "You are being inpertinent." She said. "And way too perceptive." She murmured.</p><p>"Sorry Auntie." Konatsu adjusted his skirt. "I don't know girlfriend, he's cute and all that, but isn't he a little old for you?"</p><p>"Nonsense Konatsu." Nodoka demurred. "I think an older man is just what Kodachi needs." She said. She fixed Kodachi with a disapproving stare. "You need someone who wont put up with your foolish behavior."</p><p>"He's just taking me to dinner." Kodachi complained. "Not courting me."</p><p>"A proper young lady should consider all dates as courting." Nodoka countered. "Why else would you date him?" She said. "At least you are not denying your past behavior was foolish." She looked at Konatsu. "Unlike some young ladies I could mention."</p><p>"Auntie?" Kodachi said hesitantly, unsure if the older woman would take offense at the familiarity. "do you think he would be suitable?"</p><p>"Well I haven't met him but if your Brother is allowing this dinner he must be at least somewhat acceptable." Nodoka replied. "Why wouldn't you think he's suitable?"</p><p>"He's Korean, auntie." Kodachi tried not to flinch, knowing how traditional Nodoka was. She braced herself for, well she didn't know what, but she expected it to be loud.</p><p>Nodoka's mouth lifted on one corner. "Yes," She said calmly. "That would explain his name." Nodoka looked at Kodachi. "Interesting that you did not consider his," Nodoka paused as she searched for a word. "Profession, as the concern." Nodoka looked down. "I am not unaware of Nabiki's endeavors." She said in explanation. "Or the means she is using to achieve her ends." Nodoka smoothed down a stray bit of silk on Kodachi's kimono. "There you look lovely." She said absently. "Will his being Korean be a problem for you?"</p><p>"No Auntie." Kodachi said honestly. "It's just that, oh Auntie if this is a punishment, Ky doesn't deserve to be used to punish me." Kodachi rushed out. "He doesn't deserve to be humiliated like that."</p><p>Nodoka smiled slightly. "I see." She said quietly. "Then it will be up to you to make sure he isn't humiliated, now won't it?" Nodoka led Kodachi over to the vanity. "Angry though Nabiki is at you, she will restrain herself, for Tatewaki's sake." Nodoka picked up a large brush and made some corrections to Kodachi's makeup. "And for Tatewaki's sake she is willing to try, and I want to emphasize try, to get past this sordid little affair." Nodoka gazed critically at Kodachi. "Soun is still quite angry so do not expect to be invited to dinner any time soon."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Kodachi bowed her head. Inwardly Kodachi was relieved. Not only didn't Nodoka object to the honorific she was treating Kodachi with some measure of respect. "Auntie?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Thank you." Kodachi replied. "For everything."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>'You're a senior member of the Ice Queen's organization.' Ky Young Ji berated himself. 'Stop acting like a teenager on his first date.' As he had been ordered, and Ky Young Ji did consider it an order, he arrived at seven-thirty exactly. Ten minutes later he was sitting stiffly on a chair in the library.<p>"You look nervous Ky." Nabiki said.</p><p>"Honestly Ice Queen." Ky Young Ji replied. "I am."</p><p>"Good." Tatewaki said gravely. "I am gratified you realize the seriousness of the situation." Tatewaki walked over to a bar and made himself a drink. It was his second. "I hope I don't need to stress the fact she is my sister."</p><p>"No sir." Ky Young Ji replied. "I will be respectful."</p><p>"Don't be so respectful that Kodachi is bored." Kimi chirped. "Or upset." She smiled. "Relax Ky, if we didn't think you could behave like a gentleman you wouldn't be here."</p><p>"I understand that Lady Ota." Ky replied. "Except," He looked down at his drink. His first and he barely touched it. "I don't want to embarrass her." He chewed his lower lip. "I had planned just to take her to dinner. Some place I'd be comfortable. I should have realized it wouldn't be that easy." He gave Tatewaki a look. "And I seem to have walked into the middle of something."</p><p>"That you did Ky." Tatewaki replied gravely. "But it has been resolved to everyone's satisfaction. In a way, you're her reward for her better behavior." He frowned. "That didn't come out right."</p><p>"It's alright Mr. Kuno." Ky Young Ji replied. "I think I understand." He looked at his watch and grimaced.</p><p>"It's no use looking at your watch." Nabiki said dryly. "She'll be ready when Auntie Nodoka says she's ready and not a second sooner." She chuckled. "If I know auntie. She'll purposely make Kodachi wait until she is properly late."</p><p>Despite himself Ky chuckled. "I see." He raised his glass and took a long sip of the now watery drink. "She seemed curious about our operations." He said in a questioning tone.</p><p>"She would be." Tatewaki looked at Nabiki. She shrugged. Tatewaki looked at Kimi. She made a small wave of her hand as if to say; it's up to you. Tatewaki nodded. "Use your judgement. If you don't think it's something she should know, tell her to talk to us."</p><p>Ky nodded, pleased with the implied trust. He looked up as the door opened. He fought down a look of disappointment when it was the older woman, Nodoka Saotome. Ky really didn't understand the reason for the older woman's influence on the Ice Queen but didn't foolishly deny that it existed. He stood and bowed respectfully.</p><p>"Ah, Mr. Young Ji." Nodoka said as she approached. She stopped arms length from Ky and then slowly circled him. "You'll do." She said after her assessment. "I've done my best." She said with a sigh. "But sometimes I despair. I hope you won't be too disappointed." Nodoka walked to the door and opened it. "You can come in."</p><p>Kodachi entered and it seemed as if the past walked into the room. Kodachi would not have been out of place in the home of a nineteenth century feudal lord. The high necked formal kimono was a tasteful blend of rose and a light green. Kodachi walked in with her head slightly lowered. Ky Young Ji licked suddenly dry lips. "My gods." He whispered reverently. "Go-good evening Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Good evening Mr. Young Ji." Kodachi replied quietly. She turned to her brother and bowed. She repeated her bow to Nabiki and Kimi. "Good evening." She kept her head lowered.</p><p>"Sister." Tatewaki's voice vibrated with approval.</p><p>"You outdid yourself Auntie." Kimi said.</p><p>"That's kind of you Kimi dear." Nodoka said. She looked at Kodachi with grudging approval. "I did what I could." She walked over to Kodachi. "Now thank Mr. Young Ji for his kindness."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Kodachi replied. She turned and bowed to Ky Young Ji again. "Thank you for inviting me to dinner, Ky." She said. "It was very kind of you."</p><p>"S-sure." Ky replied. 'Whoa.' He offered his arm. "Shall we go?" He smiled as Kodachi took his arm. With Kodachi on his arm. Ky turned to Tatewaki. "If you'll excuse us." Ky Young Ji escorted Kodachi out the door.</p><p>"You know I wouldn't mind going out in one of those one night." Kimi said musingly.</p><p>"The opera season starts next month." Tatewaki replied. "How about then?"</p><p>"Good idea." Nabiki decided cheerfully. "Maybe something in black."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Ranma! Get your faggot butt out here." Ryoga shouted angrily.<p>A window opened and Ranma stuck his head out. "Hey keep it down pig boy." Ranma shouted back. "Some people are trying to get some sleep."</p><p>"Don't call me Pig boy." Ryoga growled.</p><p>Akane's head appeared in the window. "Well look who's here." Akane snapped. "P-chan." Akane pulled her head inside and a few minutes later she and Ukyo appeared on the landing. "You have a lot of nerve coming here." Akane and Ukyo vaulted over the railing and landed softly on the street in front of Ryoga. Before Ryoga could say anything Akane's leg lashed out and kicked Ryoga's legs out from under him. Ukyo's spatula pressed against Ryoga's throat.</p><p>"Hey." Ryoga protested. "What did I do to you?"</p><p>"Like you don't know." Ukyo growled. "Go back to bed Ranma. We'll take it from here."</p><p>"Okay." Ranma said cheerfully. "Have fun." He pulled his head in.</p><p>"What going on?" Ting Li stuck her head out of a different window. "Oh it Ryoga." She said. She shook her head. "What a waste." She sighed and pulled her head back into the apartment. She stuck her head out a moment later. "Ukyo, you got earplugs?"</p><p>"In the medicine chest sugar." Ukyo replied. She glared down at Ryoga. "You are so dead, you know."</p><p>Ryoga batted the spatula out of his way with a negligent swat of his hand. He bounced to his feet. "Listen girly, I'm not in the mood to play." He snapped. "Ow." He said as Akane kicked him in the back. He spun around. "Ow." Ukyo's spatula connected against his head. Ryoga started blocking the attacks seriously. To his chagrin the two women were able to connect with blow after blow. Each woman would make a feint and as Ryoga would turn to block it, the other would connect. Worse when he'd ignore the feint, they'd turn it into an actual attack.</p><p>Though protected by his toughened skin and a veteran of hundreds of fights. The two women, though Akane especially, hit hard enough for the blows to start having a real effect. Sweat started to drip from Ryoga's face. "Come on guys." Ryoga pleaded. "Ease up." He ducked a swing of Ukyo's spatula. "It's me Ryoga." He jumped over a leg sweep from Akane. "Your buddy, remember?"</p><p>"You're a fucking freak." Akane spat. "P-chan."</p><p>"It's Ranma's fault." Ryoga protested.</p><p>"Sleeping in my bed as a pig is Ranma's fault?" Akane sneered. "What did he do, hold a gun to your head?" Akane rushed in and slammed her fists into Ryoga's stomach at chestnut fist speed and bounced back. "You blame Ranma for everything." She growled. "Well I'm sick of it, do you hear, sick of it." She reached out a hand. "Spatula." She ordered. Ukyo slapped her battle spatula into Akane's hand. Before Ryoga could react, Akane spun on her heels and slammed the flat of the spatula into Ryoga and sent him flying. She handed the spatula back to Ukyo. "Thanks."</p><p>"Any time sugar." Ukyo looked to where Ryoga landed heavily against the side of a building. "Well he'll be out for a couple hours." She decided. Ukyo turned back to Akane. "Feeling better?"</p><p>"Ask me in the morning." Akane grumped. "How about you?"</p><p>"I think you let him get off too easily." Ukyo put her arm around Akane's waist. "I don't know about you but I need a good cuddle." They walked back into the apartment.</p><p>A minute later a window in the apartment opened and Ting Li looked out. She grimaced. "Ow that got to hurt." She rolled her eyes and jumped out of the window and landed in the street in front of Ryoga. "Stupid, stupid man." She scolded the dazed Ryoga. She pulled out a cell phone and punched in a number. "Konatsu?" She said when the phone was answered. "Where you at?" She nodded. "Figures. Akane and Ukyo beat crap out of Ryoga and I not think it good idea I put him in apartment." She nodded. "I wait." She disconnected.</p><p>It was about fifteen minutes before Konatsu came bounding along the rooftops. He landed in front of Ting Li. Konatsu was dressed in a little black dress with matching pumps. "Oh poor baby." He cooed when he saw Ryoga. "Well we can't leave you here." He bent down and lifted Ryoga into a fireman's carry.</p><p>"Mind if I go with you?" Ting Li asked. "Might be good idea not to be around until Akane and Ukyo cool down."</p><p>"Sure honey." Konatsu replied.</p><p>Ryoga woke the next morning with a suppressed groan. To his surprise he realized he was sandwiched between two warm bodies and he was naked. 'Uh oh.' He thought. He opened one eye. 'Orange.' He thought in relief. 'Orange is good.' He began to caress Ting Li's body. "Morning Ting Li."</p><p>"Someone awake." Ting Li murmurred sleepily.</p><p>"About time." Came the voice of the person currently cuddled against Ryoga's back. A hand began to caress Ryoga's butt. "Morning stud."</p><p>"Konatsu?" Squeaked Ryoga. "Oh no, not again."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Lt. Chikato looked at the report on his desk and smiled in satisfaction. 'Violent crime down, drug use down.' An eyebrow rose. 'And it's spreading.' The lieutenant placed all the papers on his desk into a folder and stood. It was a short walk to one of the few true offices in the department. He knocked and then walked in. "Good Afternoon Captain."<p>"Chikato." Captain Hirohito Jen waved to a seat. The lieutenant sat. The Captain seemed to be of a type as Chikato. In his late fifties, barrel bodied and his hair cut so close to his scalp he might as well have been bald. He leaned back as Chikato placed the folder on the captain's desk. "I'm still not happy about this Chikato." He said seriously. "She's getting too big, too powerful.</p><p>"She's getting results." Chikato said calmly. "She's the real thing Hiro."</p><p>"She may be." Hirohito replied. "But the bigger her organization gets, the more attention she gets." He shook his head. "Tatewaki's sister was seen in the company of one of her men. The Korean." Hiro grimaced. "The girl was dressed in full, and I mean full, kimono. You know what that means as well as I do. Tatewaki is willing to, at the very least, give the impression that he is considering Ky Young Ji as a brother in law." He shook his head. "Then there was the wedding announcement. Sister!" He snorted. "Did you see how it was worded. "As Nabiki Kuno's sister. Not Nabiki Tendo's, Nabiki Kuno." He reached over to a drawer, opened it, pulled out a newspaper and tossed in on the desk. "This is the fifth time this month, Nabiki, or a close relative, good friend or even enemy, was mentioned in the paper." He shook his head. "And it's only the fourteenth."</p><p>"If you notice, the press is mostly favorable." Chikato replied. "Scandelized sometimes but mostly favorable."</p><p>"It's not the mostly favorable I worry about." Hiro replied. "She's pissing people off, Chikato, important people."</p><p>"What kind of people?" Chikato asked.</p><p>"People who should be thanking her because she's doing something but hate her because of what she represents herself to be." Hirohito said. He leaned his arms on the table. "People are starting to be able to walk the streets at night again and I've had people come in here and demand I put the Ice Queen back in prison."</p><p>"For what?" Chikato replied. "Prostitution? In case you haven't noticed Nabiki has no pimps working for her."</p><p>"Oh come on." Hirohito said in disbelief. "There are girls everywhere."</p><p>"Yes but they all are run by other families for which, I understand, she gets a franchise fee. And I need to correct you, they aren't everywhere, the areas the girls work from has actually decreased." Chikato ran his hand through his thinning hair. "I've had her books audited three times." He nodded at the surprised look on the Captain's face. "Part of the deal." He explained. "She passed all three times."</p><p>"Clean?"</p><p>"Clean." Chikato looked smug. "I even told the accountant she was dirty. I even told him how she was dirty. He came back two days later and yelled at me for insulting the Ice Queen."</p><p>"How?" The Captain swallowed. "That's impossible."</p><p>"That's what I thought." Chikato laughed. "Don't ask me how she does it but she's doing it. She's even paying taxes for the gods sakes."</p><p>"But we know she's dirty." Captain Jen argued. "We made her."</p><p>"Not really." Chikato replied. "She did it her way almost from the beginning." He shrugged. "For that matter they all did but Nabiki is in charge. Like I was saying; what can I arrest her for? There is no way to trace the prostitution to her. The only drugs within Nerima or any territory associated with her, is a small amount of weed and even there she'd stop that too but she really doesn't think it's worth it. All her businesses are legitimate."</p><p>"She's got a protection racket." The Captain said triumpantly.</p><p>"Nope, that's the Terrible Three and their friends." Chikato barked a short laugh. "And, to be honest, if we tried arresting them I think we'd have a riot on our hands. The shopkeepers love them. The don't charge much and," He laughed again. "They're good for business." He said. "A visit from even one of them is guarenteed to boost sales."</p><p>"Gambling." Declared the Captain. "You can't tell me she isn't running a gambling operation."</p><p>"Similar to the prostitution." Chikato replied. "She doesn't run the gambling halls she just leases the space and gets a cut of the take. It's also quite likely, though unprovable, that some of the businesses that are running the games are actually owned by Nabiki." He chuckled. "At least she insists that the games are clean."</p><p>"Smuggling?" The Captain asked in resigned tones.</p><p>"Probably but I haven't been able to find any evidence of it." Chikato spread his hands in a shrug. "As for your concerned citizens, I'll let Nabs know." His eye fell on the newspaper. "You know, I wouldn't be surprised if she's actually orchestrating the press coverage." He snorted. "Come to think of it I'm sure of it."</p><p>End Chapter 7</p><p>Author's notes: Having fun?</p>
