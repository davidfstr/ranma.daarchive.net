</div><p>Chapter 3</p><p>'Birds of a Feather'</p><p>Genji stopped the sports car in front of the Club. As he promised there was a group of men hanging outside the building. One of the men walked over. "Hey boss, what's the...oh hell," He exclaimed suddenly as the two women in the car got out. "Those are, they're, she's, oh shit." The man suddenly crossed his hands over his crotch. "Angels."</p><p>"Relax handsome." The smaller of the two masked women said. "Mr. Morimoto vouched for you." She smiled. "For tonight, anyway." She walked over to the man and placed a finger on his chin. "Be good and you have nothing to worry about." She said.</p><p>"Be nice, Tsumi." The taller masked woman said.</p><p>"Yes Tobi." The one called Tsumi replied with a cool smile.</p><p>"Tsumi? Tobi?" Genji whispered to Makoto.</p><p>Makoto nodded. "I'll explain later." Genji gave Makoto a look then nodded. Makoto and Yuki walked to the door of the club and opened it. The men followed the two girls into the club. Once inside they found a number of girls all dressed in black cat suits and wearing feathered masks. There was a huge man lying on a table being checked by a man in his mid or late thirties who, based on his demeanor, was probably a Doctor. Assisting him was a beautiful young woman in her mid twenties.</p><p>As the men entered the 'Angels' looked up. Genji's men, normally loud and often crude, decided, to a man, to be on their best behavior. One of the Angels beckoned Genji over. Genji, with Makoto at his side, walked over. As he approached he suddenly snorted in amusement. "And what should I call you?" He asked quietly. "Other than Ms. Kuno, that is?"</p><p>"We call her Inu-Washi." Makoto answered helpfully.</p><p>"It's a bit schizophrenic, I admit." Kodachi added. "But as recent pictures on the television attest, necessary." She smiled behind her mask. "On the other hand, the masks do have an interesting side effect." She nodded toward the cluster of Genji's men. "As you can see." Another masked woman walked over. "Ah, Hayabusa, are we about ready?"</p><p>"Just waiting for the muscle to arrive." The woman replied. "Ting Li called and they're on their way."</p><p>"And Ranma and his women?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Any minute now." The woman replied. She smiled at Genji. "In case you haven't figured it out, I'm Noriko." Noriko looked up as the door to the club opened. "Oh yes, and I sent Yoshi to pick up Tsuru and Piyopiyo." She smiled at the squeal that erupted from the doorway.</p><p>Into the room came two figures in black catsuits and feathered masks. One was adult but the other was obviously a little girl. "You can't seriously be considering taking a child into a fight?" Genji said angrily.</p><p>"Of course not, Mr. Morimoto." Kodachi replied. "Kiko will stay behind with her babysitter." Kodachi knelt down as the miniature fallen angel ran over to Kodachi. "My aren't you the perfect little angel." Kodachi cooed in greeting. "Give your Auntie a hug." She released Kiko and shook a playful finger at the little girl. "Now, I want you to promise to be good and listen to your babysitter."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Kiko promised somewhat reluctantly. "I hope she's nice."</p><p>"Oh, I think you'll like her." Kodachi promised. "You seemed to get along well before." She looked up as the door to the club opened. "Ah, here she is now." Coming through the door were four people, three adults all dressed in black cotton pants and muscle-t's and a skinny teen aged girl in jeans. Though the rain had stopped earlier, the man wore a rain slicker.</p><p>Kiko turned to look. "Pema!" Kiko exclaimed in delight.</p><p>"Kiko, that you?" Pema replied in confusion. Pema looked around quickly and noted how there were other women dressed in similar costume. Saw the costumed women surrounding the little girl. "Ah." She said in understanding. Pema ran over to Kiko. "It is you." She said. Pema bowed quickly to the adults around her. Then took Kiko's hand. The teenager took the little girl off to one side.</p><p>Genji Morimoto watched the two children go off. He looked at Kodachi and raised an eyebrow. "And she is...?" He inquired. He stopped as the three other people walked over. "Let me guess, the Terrible Three?"</p><p>"In the flesh." Ranma replied. Now that he was closer, Genji noticed that Ranma was obviously wearing makeup; theatrically applied reddish eyeshadow and matching lipstick.</p><p>"Well not as much as usual." Akane said in an aside to Ukyo. Ukyo snorted in agreement.</p><p>Ranma suppress a grin with some difficulty. "Genji Morimoto?" Ranma asked. Genji nodded. "Those your boys?" Ranma asked. Genji nodded again. This time Ranma did grin. "I think I recognize one or two of them." He said. "You must pay well cause they tip pretty good." Ranma tapped his chest. "I'm Ranma." He pointed to the black haired and athletic looking girl. "That's the Tomboy."</p><p>"Akane." Akane clarified. Genji noticed that Akane was wearing similarly theatrically applied blue eyeshadow and the remaining woman wore silver eyeshadow.</p><p>"And that's Uk-chan." Ranma continued waving a hand toward the silver eye-shadowed woman.</p><p>"Ukyo." Akane clarified as well. "But once you get to know her." She elbowed Ukyo. "Uk-chan fits better."</p><p>"You got that right, Tomboy." Ranma agreed.</p><p>"You guys." Ukyo mock complained. She waved to Genji. "Hey."</p><p>"And the girl?" Genji asked.</p><p>"Pema." Ranma replied. "Part of the reason Abe was shot." Ranma looked over to where Pema and Kiko were sitting and giggling. "Tokio is trying to get his property back and sending a message." He looked around. "Where's Pig Boy?" Ranma asked. "Can't have a party without a pig."</p><p>"Maybe he stopped for something to eat." Akane cracked. "You know how that boy loves to stuff his face."</p><p>"I'm missing something." Genji said when the people around him broke into laughter.</p><p>"I'll tell you later, Genji." Makoto promised.</p><p>"I'm going to talk to my Sister." Akane said. "Get me when you guys decide what to do." She turned. "Coming, Uk-chan?"</p><p>"Right behind you, Tomboy," Ukyo replied. With Akane slightly in the lead they walked off toward Kasumi.</p><p>Ranma turned to Kodachi. "Speaking of which, what did you have in mind?" He jerked a thumb at the retreating Akane and Ukyo. "The guys and me don't care as long as we get to pound something." Ranma nodded toward where Pema and Kiko were sitting and playing a complicated hand clapping game. "We've been wanting to pound the bastards since I found Pema." He said. "And we gotta lot of pent up 'pissed-off' to work off."</p><p>"Crude, but essentially what I had in mind." Kodachi said grimly. "We are going to Tokio's main, shall we say, hideout." There was no humor in Kodachi's smile. "Once there we will see to it that it is no longer usable."</p><p>"Tokio gonna be there?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Unlikely." Kodachi replied. "And if he is, The Ice Queen has reserved the right to deal with him, herself." Kodachi raised a hand. "Do not doubt that I share your anger." She turned her head toward where Kiko and Pema were giggling over something. "She could have been hurt."</p><p>"Or worse." Added Noriko. "It's getting late." She said. "Dawn is in a couple hours."</p><p>"The Pig probably got lost on the way." Ranma said sourly. The door into the club opened just as he said it. Ranma laughed. "What'd he do; fall in a puddle?" He said to the newcomers. Apparently two pretty women and one angry looking pig.</p><p>One of the two women was dressed in traditional Joketsuzoku armor. Greaves and vanbraces, covered shins and forearms. A breastplate made of strips of metal, chainmail and laquered leather covered her upper body. Her orange hair held in place by a head piece that seemed more crown than helmet. The other woman wore the traditional garb favored by female ninja. In her arms was the pig. "I told him to wear a raincoat, but no, he has to be all macho." The kunoichi said sourly. The pig squealed. "Yeah, yeah, hot water." One of the catsuited girls came over with a tea pot. "Thanks girlfriend." The kunoichi said. Without fanfare she poured the hot water on the pig.</p><p>Genji's eyes widened in shock as the pig suddenly transformed into a powerfully built and naked young man. "Konatsu." The transformed pig complained to the kunoichi. "You could have found someplace private."</p><p>"What and have us miss the show?" The cat suited girl said. She whistled. "Not bad, Ryoga, not bad at all."</p><p>"You ain't seen nothing." The kunoichi said in smug tones. His hands spread apart. "You should see him when..."</p><p>"Konatsu!" Interrupted Ryoga angrily. "what did I tell you?" He asked. "And would you mind giving me my clothes." He complained.</p><p>"Oh you such baby." The orange haired warrior growled. She tossed Ryoga a bag. "Here."</p><p>Genji turned to Ranma. " Did he just..." He stopped. "He was a pig." He complained.</p><p>"Curse." Ranma replied with a chuckle. "Cold water pig, hot water man." He said. "Don't worry about it."</p><p>Ryoga, dressed in a leather skirt and a leather and metal chest protector that was similar to Ting Li's, wandered over to Ranma. Ting Li and Konatsu followed just behind. Ryoga crossed his massive arms across his equally massive chest. "Still wearing makeup, huh girly?"</p><p>"I wouldn't talk, Pig boy." Ranma replied. "Nice dress."</p><p>"Kilt." Growled Ryoga. "It's a kilt."</p><p>Genji turned to Makoto. "Old friends?" He asked in amused tones. Makoto nodded. Genji looked over at the assembled group. "So this is the Ice Queen's muscle." Genji Morimoto nearly rolled his eyes. "And you're going against Tokio Wasuhara?" Makoto nodded again. "They better be as good as you say they are." He said in doubtful tones.</p><p>"Don't worry, Mr. Morimoto." Kodachi said. "They are." Kodachi clapped her hands. "Girls." She called. Kodachi's girls hurriedly made a semi circle around Kodachi. "Girls, our target is less than twenty minutes frrom here." She said briskly. "Tsumi. You and Tobi will liase with Mr. Morimoto and his men." Makoto clapped her hands together gleefully. Yuki seemed less enthused but she understood she was being made responsible for Genji Morimoto's safety. "Misago, you and Zuku will coordinate getting any girls we may find out of there."</p><p>"Miki and Fumie." Whispered Makoto to Genji.</p><p>"The rest of you will be with me." Kodachi continued. "Ranma do you want to take point or..."</p><p>"Point." Ranma interrupted. "The Tomboy needs to work off even more steam than I do." He grinned at Ryoga. "Don't worry Pig-Boy, Akane'll leave you plenty to do." His grin got wider. "Maybe."</p><p>"What about Dou Gan Shou?" Ting Li demanded.</p><p>"I'm so glad you brought that up." Kodachi smiled.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The pirate craft rocked gently as the early morning tide came in. Anchored in a natural and secluded harbor the pirates barely maintained more than the minimum security and those that were on watch were more concerned with nursing a hangover then paying attention to any possible discovery. Dou Gan Shou had discovered this harbor many years before and he and his crew had good reason not to worry too much.</p><p>Had they been looking, they would have seen a dark object break the surface near one ship. Then another and another. The first of the objects extended a hand and revealed itself to be a swimmer. The swimmer climbed the side of the boat quickly and quietly until he reached the deck. He was quickly joined by a half dozen others.</p><p>"On your command, My Lord." One of the men said in quiet tones.</p><p>"Remember, we want the pirate leader alive." The man replied. He waved an arm. "Go." The men dispersed except for the leader and one other. A diminuative bandy legged dark clad figure. "Ready, old friend?" The man asked.</p><p>"Ready, Master." The little man replied with a sigh. "You will try to stay out of trouble, won't you master?"</p><p>"Trouble? Me?" The man replied with a chuckle. "You worry too much Sasuke." He rolled his eyes at the grumble that came from the retainer. "Oh, all right, Sasuke, I'll keep my head down." He promised.</p><p>"Thank you, Master." Sasuke replied. "I'm sure the Lady Tendo will thank you as well."</p><p>"Oh that reminds me." Tatewaki said. "I need a best man for the wedding." He said conversationally though quietly. "I have a few thoughts, but I'd appreciate hearing any suggestions you might have."</p><p>Sasuke and Tatewaki reached a door. Tatewaki pressed against the side as Sasuke picked the lock. Sasuke opened the door and darted inside. Tatewaki followed. The sole occupant of the cabin was asleep. Sasuke blew some powder into the man's face. The drug ensured that the man would not wake. Sasuke examined the man's face. "Not Dou Gan Shou." He declared. They slipped out of the cabin. "Best Man, Master?" Sasuke asked. "I wouldn't presume to suggest anyone master but I would think he would need to be of impeccable heritage."</p><p>"Agreed." Tatewaki rumbled. They reached another cabin door and again they slipped quietly inside. Again someone was asleep. Sasuke padded over and was about to blow the sleeping powder into the man's face and stopped. "Problem, Sasuke?" Tatewaki asked.</p><p>"I fear you will unable to keep your promise to Lady Tendo." Sasuke said quietly. Sasuke reached over and turned the man's head. "Dou Gan Shou, Master." Sasuke said. "And he appears...dead."</p><p>Tatewaki walked over to the body on the bed. He examined the body and then shook his head. "Disappointing." He murmured. "I had hoped to provide my Lady with a suitable wedding present." He shrugged. "Ah well, I suppose she will have to content herself with a diamond or some equally meaningless trinket." Tatewaki sighed. "I do hope she forgives me."</p><p>"I'm sure she will Master." Sasuke replied. "Maybe she will accept whomever killed Dou Gan Shou instead." Sasuke suggested. He looked at the dead pirate. "He must still be on this ship." Sasuke pointed out.</p><p>"Aye." Tatewaki agreed. He headed toward the door of the cabin. He could hear the ship begin to stir as the actions of his men began to be noticed. The two men exited the cabin and walked down the narrow corridor. "So, what other qualities should a best man have?" Tatewaki asked.</p><p>"I would hope he would be a friend, Master." Sasuke said as he scanned the corridor. A cabin door burst open and a pirate careened out backwards. He was followed by one of Kuno's retainers. The retainer blew some powder into the pirates face who immediately collapsed. The retainer sketched a short bow to Tatewaki and then hurried off in search of another pirate.</p><p>"A friend." Tatewaki said musingly as if nothing had happened. "Aye, that would be something to hope for." He said. "A friend, with impeccable heritage, then?"</p><p>"Yes, Master." Sasuke agreed. Sasuke looked up as a monster of a man, with an eyepatch, suddenly appeared at the end of the corridor. The man carried a large knife, almost a sword, from the way he handled it, it was obvious he knew how to use it. "Master." Sasuke said in warning.</p><p>"I see him, my friend." Tatewaki rumbled. "Ho varlet." Tatewaki called. "Will you surrender?" The pirate narrowed his one eye angrily and charged. "I suppose that is a no." Tatewaki said in amusement. "Have at thee then, knave." Tatewaki cried and met the man's charge. The quiet of the ship ended as Tatewaki's blade met the pirates knife.</p><p>"He always has to play." Sasuke grumbled half-heartedly. In truth, Sasuke was proud of Tatewaki. Proud of his skill and even prouder of his actions. 'It's about time these pirates were dealt with.' He thought in satisfaction. Sasuke contented himself with guarding Tatewaki's back as Tatewaki fought the pirate. From Sasuke's point of view it was obvious that Tatewaki was playing with the pirate.</p><p>Sasuke turned as one of the retainers approached. The man was obviously going to intervene. Sasuke blocked the man's path. "This one belongs to the Master." Sasuke said quietly. "You wouldn't want to shame him by interfering, would you?" The man hesitated for a moment then shook his head. "Good." Sasuke said. "The ship?"</p><p>"Secure." The man reported. "All personnel have been dealt with."</p><p>"Excellent." Sasuke replied. "The Master will be pleased." Sasuke looked over to where Tatewaki was sparring, well Tatewaki was sparring, with the pirate. "Oh we found the Captain." Sasuke told the retainer. "Dead."</p><p>"Pity." The retainer replied. "Still, I believe Lord Kuno is fighting the second in command." He nodded toward the pirate. "That's One-Eyed Wong." The retainer and Sasuke exchanged grins.</p><p>"Master." Sasuke called. "It looks like you'll have a suitable present for Lady Tendo after all."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Dawn was just beginning to lighten the sky as a convoy of trucks and cars pulled up before the gate of a well protected enclave. The compound was, as Kodachi decribed it, Tokio Wasuhara's main 'hideout'. Genji Morimoto looked at the gate from the drivers seat of his sports car. "Now what?" He asked.</p><p>"Now we wait until the gate...um...opens." Makoto replied.</p><p>Genji raised an eyebrow but said nothing. He noticed when the black haired and athletic woman, known as Akane Tendo and the burly Ryoga Hibiki approached the game. They appeared to be shaking their fists at each other. Finally Ryoga waved a hand toward the gate. "What's she going to...oh crap." Genji exclaimed as the black haired girl ripped the gate right off and tossed it aside. "That's impossible."</p><p>"Not for her." Yuki commented. "I told you, don't underestimate the resources at the Ice Queen's command." She jerked her chin toward the gate. "Time to go in."</p><p>Makoto took Genji's arm. "Now you stay with Tobi and me." Makoto said. "Tobi." She nodded her head at Genji's other arm. "Honestly, you'd think she'd know by now." She said in complaint to Genji. "You're going to be even more important to the Ice Queen after tonight." She told the older man proudly. "She's finally seeing what I saw when I first met you."</p><p>Genji Morimoto smiled a pleased smile that quickly faded as the assault group advanced. Genji's eyes widened in shock as the leading martial artists; Ranma, Akane, Ukyo, Ryoga, Ting Li and Kontasu, started bounding ahead, taking incredible leaps that left Genji, his men and most of the Fallen Angels behind. Only one of the cat suited women kept up. "My gods, is that Ms. Kuno?"</p><p>"Inu-Washi, Genji." Makoto scolded playfully. "You have to call her Inu-washi." Makoto smiled innocently. "It's the rules." She nodded rapidly. "Mmhmm." She said in agreement. Suddenly Makoto pulled Genji to the side and stopped. "Watch out, Genji." She pointed to the ground in front of her. Stretching ahead and following the path of the martial artists were three lines of whitish footprints</p><p>Genji's eyes narrowed in confusion. "Is that ice?" He asked. He bent down and examined the ground. There was a rumble behind him. Genji looked up as his men and the rest of the Angels gathered around him.</p><p>"Did you see that, boss?" One of the men said excitedly. "Those guys can really move." He grinned. "I heard about it, but I never saw them in action before." He looked toward the house. "Hey boss, is it true what Karasu said?" He nodded toward one of the masked women. Now that Genji really looked he could see that the masks resembled the birds the girls were named after.</p><p>"Aoi." Makoto whispered in Genji's ear.</p><p>"What did, um, Karasu, tell you?" Genji asked.</p><p>"About the girls." The man asked. Genji nodded. The man looked toward the house. "How do you wanna play it boss?"</p><p>"Hard." Genji replied. He waved a hand. "Do what you have to."</p><p>"You got it boss." The man said. He started jogging toward the compound. The rest of Genji's truckers and the Angel's followed.</p><p>Genji stood. "Ice." He mused. He shrugged and started walking toward the main building. Now that they were in the compound he could see that there were several other buildings, though as he looked one of the buildings seemed to shiver and then collapse. "How are they doing that?" He asked.</p><p>"Chi." Yuki answered. "They're adepts." She smiled behind her mask. "As is Lord Kuno."</p><p>They reached the main building. Genji could see a large hole where, presumably, there once was a door. With Makoto still holding his arm, they entered the building. Genji's men were in the middle of a fierce fight against an equal number of thugs. It seemed to be an even match until the the street fighter, Ryoga Hibiki, waded into the midst of the fight. It seemed that the massive street fighter did little more than tap a combatant on the arm or leg or basically any body part to put the thug out of action.</p><p>"Chi?" Genji asked Yuki.</p><p>"Chi." Agreed Yuki. She took Genji's other arm. "From what I understand, he's being nice about it too." She pointed to where Konatsu Kanzen was dealing with another group. Well Genji assumed it was the Kunoichi, what he actually saw was a blur that at times solidified into the Kunoichi. "Konatsu is being nice too." She said. "Duck!" She exclaimed a moment later as a Yakusa thug sailed, screaming, over their heads. "Ting Li's playing nice too."</p><p>"Hate to see her mad." Genji commented. Genji shook his head. "It's like watching one of those silly animes." He said. "Doesn't look so silly in real life."</p><p>End Chapter 3</p><p>Author's Notes: Nothing really, except to say I picked Inu-Washi for Kodachi for two reasons, one it means "Golden Eagle" and two, it sounds similar to another Rumiko Takahashi character.</p>
