</div>Chapter 3<p>'Auntie's night out'</p><p>Noriko Mata walked into the club. The last couple of months had made their mark on the young woman.</p><p>The training was no longer confined to weekends, nor did it require the accompaniment of Kodachi though Noriko preferred it when Kodachi was there. Three, sometimes four, times a week for two or more hours, Noriko would be trained by either Mr. Tendo or Mr. Saotome. Noriko liked training with Mr. Saotome best because it meant that Nodoka Saotome, 'Auntie' as she insisted, would be present. Besides the club was closed during most of the day and even when open, the club ran smoothly and efficiently due to Noriko's leadership. Between the physical training and an income that no longer depended on turning tricks, though she did keep one or two of her regulars, Noriko had become even more confident and assured.</p><p>Noriko looked around at the pleasant bustle around her. The croupiers and dealers were at their tables, waitresses carried trays of drinks, and, Noriko smiled, couples were being escorted to tables near the stage. She caught the eye of one of the working girl's, a smile and a quickly flashed V, was all the answer Noriko needed. Noriko nodded in satisfaction. She proceeded to her desk. Her desk being more of a concierge station than an office.</p><p>Being manager of the club meant being responsible for the million and one things that kept the club running. No sooner had she sat down than one of her assistants ran up with a clip board full of things for Noriko to sign. Bills needed to be paid, food and drink ordered, inventory to be checked. Noriko had her assistants. By some unspoken agreement all the assistants were working girls. It had started when Kodachi had first given Noriko an opportunity and Noriko saw no reason to stop. 'Besides, I know them all.' Noriko had told herself. Noriko leaned her chair back during a lull. "I think it's time to take a walk around." She decided. Noriko stood and began circulating. 'Ms. Kuno has no appointments today.' She mused as she walked. 'I do hope she decides to stay home.' She pulled out her cell phone and punched a number. "Yoshi, is Ms. Kuno preparing to leave?" She nodded. "Good, why don't you convince her to stay home? I'll call if anything important comes up." She smiled into the phone. "Thanks Yoshi," Her smile became a grin. "We still on for this weekend?" She laughed and disconnected.</p><p>The evening continued to pass uneventfully. 'Still need another girl.' She thought as she watched the steady stream of couples toward the back rooms. Ami had worked out well and, in fact, was becoming pretty popular. The most popular girls however were the girls that danced in the cabaret. What they lost in frequency they were more than making up for the higher rates they found they could charge. Noriko suppressed a giggle at the memory of a small bidding war that had broken out over Miki one night. The only downside was now all the girls wanted to dance. 'Not that I blame them.' She admitted. Noriko also admitted that this was another reason to only have the girls as assistants, that way she could add to their income. 'And give them benefits.' She thought in satisfaction. 'Speaking of Miki.' Noriko thought as the mentioned woman hurried over.</p><p>"Girl, you are not going to believe who is here?" Miki giggled. She grabbed Noriko and turned her toward the door.</p><p>"Mrs. Saotome." Noriko said in surprise. "Quick, find an empty table."</p><p>"Already taken care of Boss." Miki grinned. "Come on." Miki pulled Noriko along though Noriko quickly matched her pace. The quickly approached the older woman. Nodoka was dressed in her trademark kimono. "Gods I hope I look that good when I'm her age." Miki said in a quiet aside.</p><p>"Me too." Agreed Noriko. "Auntie." Noriko said in greeting. "This is a surprise." She bowed in friendly fashion and then looped her arm through Nodoka's. "A pleasant one, but a surprise." She looked at Nodoka closely. "Oh dear, is something wrong?"</p><p>Nodoka sighed in exasperation. "Not wrong, just Genma." She said shortly. "I really needed to get out of the house."</p><p>"And you came here?" Noriko said in a mixture of surprise and pleasure. She escorted Nodoka to an empty table. Another girl hovered near the table. Noriko nodded at the table and she walked over and greeted Nodoka. "You remember Miki and Aoi don't you?"</p><p>"Of course." Nodoka said in pleased recognition. "How are you two?" She asked pleasantly. She smiled at the affirmative responses. Her smile widened when Miki, Aoi and Noriko all sat down. "Oh you are so kind to keep an old woman company."</p><p>"Stop fishing for compliments Auntie." Noriko said in laughter. "You're not old." She said. "And I'm sure you still turn heads."</p><p>"Obviously not Genma's." Nodoka grumbled. "Men." She said in exasperation. She smiled ruefully at the laughter that erupted around her. "Well you know what I mean."</p><p>"Yes we do Auntie." Noriko said cheerfully. She raised a hand and a waitress rushed over. "What you need Auntie is a drink." Noriko said decisively. "Sake?" She asked. "From Ms. Kuno's private stock." She sang enticingly.</p><p>"Well in that case." Nodoka said. The waitress raced away. She quickly returned with a large bottle of Sake, properly warmed Nodoka noted, and hovered nearby. The sake was as good as she expected and Nodoka let the hot wine relax her enough to start enjoying herself. This was the first time Nodoka had been to the club and she was terribly curious. "Is there going to be a Cabaret tonight?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"In about an hour Auntie." Noriko replied. She nodded at Miki. "In fact Miki needs to change soon."</p><p>"You're dancing Miki?" Nodoka asked. "That's wonderful. I can't wait to see it." Nodoka frowned slightly at the suddenly embarrassed look on Miki's face. "Did I say something wrong?"</p><p>"Oh no Auntie." Miki replied. "It's just that the show is a little," She paused. "Um, risque."</p><p>Nodoka laughed. "I'm not that old fashioned." She protested in amusement. "Akane did teach you, didn't she?" She said. "And I have seen U.S.A. dance." She fanned herself briefly. "Somehow I doubt what you are doing is quite the same."</p><p>Miki and Aoi laughed. "Aren't they great?" Miki gushed. "All the girls have been to the Kabuki to see them." She sighed. "Gods I wish I could move like that." Noriko and Aoi made noises of agreement. "Or look like that." Miki added. "Especially Ranko, gods that girl is built." She looked at Nodoka. "And I see where she got it."</p><p>Nodoka snorted quietly. "My son surpasses me in that department." She said ruefully. She smiled at the giggles from the surrounding girls. "Well he does."</p><p>"It's so strange to hear someone refer to Ranko as he." Aoi commented.</p><p>"Well he was born a boy." Nodoka said easily. She rolled her eyes. "Though sometimes he does seem to forget that." She said.</p><p>"Akane and Ukyo don't." Noriko said knowingly. "I have never seen two women who looked so damn satisfied with a man." She said. "Makes me jealous."</p><p>Nodoka smiled proudly. "Well he is a very manly young man." Nodoka sipped her sake. "And apparently a very womanly young woman as well." She laughed self consciously. "It takes a little getting used to." She said.</p><p>"I'm sure." Aoi said. "But I'd trade places with Akane or Ukyo in a hot minute."</p><p>"Amen sister." Miki and Noriko chorused. Miki stood. "I have to change. I hope you enjoy the show Mrs. Saotome."</p><p>"Oh I'm sure I will." Nodoka said in a reassuring tone. She smiled. "Break a leg, as my son says." She waved her hands. "Go on." Giggling Miki hurried off. Nodoka sipped some more sake. She looked around the club. "I assume the games are honest." She said in a slightly questioning voice.</p><p>"As if Ms. Kuno would have it any other way." Noriko said firmly. "Do you want to play? We could give you a line of credit if you want."</p><p>Nodoka laughed. "Thank you, but no dear." She said. "I fear I have no head for games." She lifted the sake bottle. "Oh dear, it's empty." Before Nodoka could say anymore the hovering waitress had retrieved the bottle and hurried away. "My the service here is excellent.."</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Noriko replied. She gave the waitress an approving nod when she returned with a fresh bottle of sake. "Please bring Mrs. Saotome something to eat." She instructed the waitress. "Something light." She turned to Nodoka. "Ms. Kuno found us an excellent chef." She explained. She giggled. "We're beginning to have people come just for the food." She said. "Makes a girl jealous."</p><p>Nodoka frowned. "Sometimes I think Genma stays with me for the same reason." She grumbled.</p><p>"Then he's an idiot." Noriko replied. A girl ran over and whispered something in Noriko's ear. "I'll be right there." She told the woman.</p><p>"Problem?" Nodoka asked in concern.</p><p>"Nothing I can't handle." Noriko replied confidently. "If you'll excuse me. I'll be back in a minute." With a polite nod to Nodoka Noriko walked away.</p><p>Nodoka followed her with her eyes as Noriko walked over to the bar and picked up a telephone. Nodoka shrugged and turned her attention back to the goings on in the club. Gambling didn't bother Nodoka and she approved of what Nabiki was trying to accomplish and more importantly of what her son had accomplished.</p><p>Nor was Nodoka immune to the increased respect she was getting. Many of the older women would come to Nodoka and, not exactly, ask for assistance. And Nodoka would have a word in Nabiki or Kodachi's ear. Homes had been saved, jobs were found, disputes settled. Prostitution still bothered Nodoka but she had come to know, like and even respect some of them. 'I hope Kodachi understands what a gem Noriko is.' She thought to herself.</p><p>Lost in thought Nodoka barely acknowledged when Aoi excused herself, and further failed to notice that she was suddenly joined by two men. Not until one of them spoke.</p><p>"May we buy you a drink?" A hesitant voice said at Nodoka's right.</p><p>Nodoko looked up and noticed the two men. Nodoka judged them both to be in their mid twenties at the most. Both were atheletic, something Nodoka appreciated. 'My how manly.' She thought. "May I help you?"</p><p>"I hope so." The second man said in a pleasant tenor. "My buddy and I noticed you and we, well er, we." To Nodoka's surprise the second young man started to blush. "Do you work here?" He half squeaked.</p><p>"Work here?" Nodoka's eyebrow arched high. 'They think, oh my.' Nodoka fought down a blush. "Aren't I a little old for you, young man?" To Nodoka's surprise both men shook their heads vigorously.</p><p>"You look great." Gushed one. The other nodded quickly. The both looked at Nodoka hungrily.</p><p>Nodoka covered her mouth as she giggled. 'I think I'm beginning to understand why some women become prostitutes. The attention is almost irrisistable.' She blushed. "Nodoka Saotome.' She scolded herself. 'Shame on you.' She looked at the two hopeful young men. "Why don't we start with a drink?" She suggested. She raised a hand and the waitress seemed to appear by magic. "Another bottle of Sake." She told the waitress.</p><p>"I'm paying," The first young man said.</p><p>The waitress leaned over. "Mrs Saotome they think you're working." She whispered urgently.</p><p>"I know." Nodoka whispered back. "Isn't it exciting?" She smiled brightly at the two young men. "A big bottle of Sake." She said in a louder voice.</p><p>The waitress smiled wryly. 'Wants to play does she?' She thought in amusement. "One large bottle of Sake coming up." The waitress smiled. "Miss Nodoka." She started giggling as she walked away. By the time she returned the two men had changed their seats so they were flanking Nodoka. She placed the bottle on the table and was paid. 'I'd better tell Ms Mata about this before it gets out of hand.' She thought. She fought down another bout of giggles as she noticed that the two men each had an arm under the table and the waitress was pretty sure she knew where their hands were. Still fighting her giggles she hurried back to where Noriko was.</p><p>Nodoka found herself fending off the questing hands of the two young men. Though truth be told she wasn't trying too hard. Nodoka giggled. She raised her empty sake glass and the two men almost fought to fill it for her. 'This is turning out to be a wonderful evening.' She thought.</p><p>Noriko looked up when the waitress came over. "Yes?"</p><p>"You're going to have to rescue Mrs Saotome." She looked back of her shoulder and giggled. "But maybe not yet."</p><p>Noriko stood and looked over at Mrs Saotome's table. "Tell me it's not what I think it is." She rolled her eyes. "Well I'd better break it up before it gets out of hand."</p><p>"Oh let the old girl have some fun." The waitress pleaded.</p><p>An evil smile came to Noriko's lips. "I have a better idea." She picked up her phone and dialed a number. "Hello Mr Saotome?" Noriko said. The waitress giggled. Noriko cupped the mouthpiece. "Go make sure Mrs Saotome doesn't leave the table with them." She ordered. "This is Noriko Mata. How are you?" She asked. "Your wife? Why yes, I have seen her, she's here." Noriko rolled her eyes. "I assumed you knew." She said. "Hello? Hello?" Noriko put down the phone and smiled.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Genma burst into the Club. "Where is she?" He roared. He scanned the club through slitted eyes. He quickly spotted Nodoka seated at a table. "Nodoka?" Anger suffused his face as he also realized she wasn't alone. He almost ran over to the table. "Nodoka." He growled.<p>Nodoka turned in her chair and peered tipsily at Genma. A big smile came to her face. "Hey Baldy." She sang.</p><p>"Nodoka." He said reprovingly. "You're drunk." He accused. Then his face fell as Nodoka's words penetrated. "Baldy?" He said in hurt tones.</p><p>"Oh don't be such a baby." Nodoka scolded. "You look good bald." She said. "And I have it on very good authority that bald men are the most virile." She frowned. "Though one wouldn't know that by your actions. Or inaction." She declared loudly. "You haven't touched me in months."</p><p>"Well you see Nodoka." Stammered Genma.</p><p>"No I don't see." Nodoka replied tartly. "I have needs too you know." She waved a hand to indicate the two, now nervous looking, young men flanking her. "And apparently if you don't find me attractive, there are plenty of men who do.' She cupped the chin of one of the young men. "Don't you young man?" Despite his nervousness the young man nodded. "See?" She said to Genma.</p><p>"Nodoka." Genma said reprovingly. "We're going home." He declared. "I really wouldn't try to interfere little boy." Genma said as one of the young men half rose in his seat. He picked Nodoka up and slung her over his shoulder. He marched out of the club.</p><p>"Bye." Sang Nodoka to the two young men. "I had a wonderful evening." She blew kisses at them.</p><p>The two young men waved forlornly to Nodoka's retreating figure.</p><p>End Chapter 3</p><p>Author's Notes: Just for fun.</p>
