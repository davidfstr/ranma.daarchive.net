</div><p>Chapter 5</p><p>'Vengeance'</p><p>Nabiki and Kimi walked into the television lounge. A small number of women were watching a local soap opera. 'Perfect.' Thought Nabiki. The two women sat down in a couple vacant chairs close to several other women, though Nabiki made sure it wasn't in direct sight of the surveillance camera. Nabiki made herself comfortable then reached into her smock and pulled out a small bottle. Nabiki opened the bottle and placed the open end against her wrist. Nabiki closed the bottle, replaced it in her smock and then rubbed her wrists together. Nabiki sniffed at her wrist and smiled. "What do you think Kimi?" She asked and extended her wrist to Kimi.</p><p>Kimi sniffed. She nodded. "Definitely your scent." Kimi said.</p><p>One of the women snapped her head around. "I smell perfume." She said in disbelief. She looked over to where Nabiki and Kimi were sitting. She sniffed again. A look on longing appeared on her face. "Where? How?" She whispered. She swallowed. "Never mind. Do you have any more?"</p><p>Nabiki locked her eyes on the woman. "Possibly." She said calmly. "For a price." Nabiki smiled her most shark-like smile. "Come to Cell 52 later and we can talk."</p><p>By the end of the day, Nabiki and Kimi had completed making the rounds of the prison. They never really said anything. They'd just oh so nonchalantly demonstrate one or more of their wares. That would usually be enough. Someone would talk to them.</p><p>As they approached their cell they could see a number of women already clustered around their cell door. Ranma and Akane were standing in front of the cell keeping order. Ranma spotted their approach first. Ranma nodded to Nabiki.</p><p>"Word gets around fast." Ranma said with a grin. "How do you want to handle it?"</p><p>"One at a time." Nabiki said easily. She and Kimi entered their cell. A moment later Ranma let the first of the women in. Nabiki pointed to the bunk. "Please have a seat." The woman nodded and sat down Nabiki gave the woman her best shark grin. "This is how it works." Nabiki said. "You tell me what you want, I'll tell you how much. You pay up front. Delivery will be later." Nabiki crossed her legs and folded her arms. "No booze, no drugs, no cigarettes, other than that." Nabiki said. "So what can I do for you?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>The woman licked her lips. "I heard," The woman began hesitantly. "Is it true you have," The woman broke off. She pulled at her hair. "My hair feels like straw." She said finally.</p><p>Kimi walked over to the woman and touched a lock of the woman's hair. "You poor thing." Kimi said in sympathy. "We must do something for her Chief."</p><p>"I'll pay anything." The woman said.</p><p>Nabiki nodded to Kimi. Kimi walked over to her bunk and rummaged under her mattress. She pulled out a trial size bottle and looked at it. She nodded. Kimi walked over and held the bottle in front of the woman. "Two thousand yen."</p><p>The woman's eyes widened. "That's my favorite brand." She said in wonder. She made to grab at the bottle but Kimi pulled it out of reach.</p><p>"This is just for display purposes." Kimi said. "As the Chief said. Delivery comes later."</p><p>The woman scrambled at her smock and extracted several bills. "Deal." She said. She handed the bank notes to Nabiki. "My names Aoi Kasamura. I'm in cell 122."</p><p>Nabiki nodded and wrote down the information in her note pad and then handed the woman a receipt. "You'll be hearing from us." Nabiki said. "Anything else?"</p><p>"No, this'll be fine for now." The woman rose. "Thank you. Chief."</p><p>Kimi escorted the woman to the cell door. "Next." She said.</p><p>Aoi Kasamura woke up the following morning. She rolled over in her bunk and opened her eyes. Her eyes widened in shock seeing a small bottle sitting on her pillow. She grabbed at it. "Oh my heavens." She gasped. Aoi clutched the bottle to her chest.</p><p>A week later Nabiki sat in her bunk counting the day's take. "Heh." She said in satisfaction. "We've already broke even." She stashed the money under her mattress. "I'll have Ranko hide this tonight."</p><p>"Good." Said Kimi. "We make a pretty good team, huh Nabs?"</p><p>"A very good team, Kimi." Nabiki agreed. "You made some excellent guesses about what to get." Nabiki patted her bunk. "How about we celebrate?"</p><p>Kimi laughed. "God you're insatiable."</p><p>"I am too satiable." Nabiki said primly. Then she grinned. "It's your fault you know."</p><p>"I've created a monster." Kimi sat down next to Nabiki. "What are you going to do when you get out of here and I'm stuck behind?" She teased.</p><p>"I don't know." Nabiki said seriously. "I really don't want to think about it."</p><p>"Hey. Hey." Kimi said soothingly. "Let's not worry about what might be. We have now. That's all that counts." She gave Nabiki a searching look. "What's wrong Nabs?"</p><p>"I don't know." Nabiki replied. "I guess I never expected to care for another woman." She admitted after awhile. "Let alone having a woman for a lover."</p><p>"Think I might have ruined you for men?" Asked Kimi. She smiled at Nabiki's blush. "Thought so." She took Nabiki's hand. "If you want to know the truth, I think you may be ruining me for men too." Then she smiled. "But Auntie Kimi has a solution for that."</p><p>Nabiki giggled. "And that is?"</p><p>"When I get out," She pointed to Nabiki and then herself. "You and I are going to get together and pick out the hottest guy we can find and give him a night he'll remember for the rest of his life." She grinned. "Deal?"</p><p>Nabiki grinned back. "Deal." She replied. "One guy?" She asked a moment later.</p><p>"Yup." Kimi giggled again. "Just in case you need a little something extra."</p><p>"Good thinking." Nabiki agreed. "Speaking of something extra." Nabiki took Kimi's hand and placed it on her breast.</p><p>"God, I created a monster." Kimi repeated. She giggled. "Damn I'm good."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Don't take this wrong Tomboy." Ranma said. "But I think prison life agrees with Nabiki."<p>Akane rolled her eyes. "You noticed, huh?" She and Ranma were working in the prison kitchen. For obvious reasons Ranma kept nervously looking toward the large stove where a pot of water was boiling. Akane kept a bottle of cold water at her side. Just in case. "My sister, the junior Yakusa." Akane cracked.</p><p>"I dunno Akane." Ranma replied. "At this rate she's gonna be a senior Yakusa." Ranma chuckled. "Damn I'm glad she's on our side."</p><p>"Well you did say making money was her art." Akane gave Ranma the last plate to dry. She and Ranma stacked up the dishes and carried them to a large cabinet. Ranma looked quickly around and, seeing that they were alone, started tossing the plates into the cabinet. They landed evenly stacked. "Show off." Akane said. Then she leaned over and gave Ranma a quick kiss. "Want to go for a walk tonight?" Akane whispered. "Just for fun."</p><p>"Oh like I'm gonna say no." Ranma replied.</p><p>"Oh good." Akane looked around. "I think we're done here." The two women walked to the guard station. "We've finished the dishes." Akane said. "All wash, dried and put away."</p><p>"That was fast." Said the guard. She reached down. There was a buzz and the door swung open. "See you tomorrow."</p><p>Akane and Ranma waved in acknowledgment and walked back into the main part of the prison. As they neared their cell Nabiki came running toward them. "Hey Nabs." Called Ranma. "What's up?"</p><p>"Have you seen Kimi?" Nabiki asked worriedly. "We were supposed to meet at the library but she never showed."</p><p>"Sorry we just got off work." Akane replied. "When was this supposed to happen?"</p><p>"About an hour ago." Nabiki replied. "Kimi is reliable. She's never late."</p><p>"I'm sure it's nothing." Akane replied. She took in the worried look on Nabiki's face. "Well it couldn't hurt to go look for her." The three women started walking through the prison. They inquired about Kimi's location from those acquaintances they ran into. The fifth person they met remembered seeing Kimi heading toward the showers.</p><p>"As good a place to look as any." Ranma said. The three women walked toward the showers. As they entered they noticed that the lights were out. Ranma and Akane immediately went into threat mode. "The lights are never out at this time." Ranma said ominously. Her head snapped around. "Did you hear something?"</p><p>Akane nodded. "Yeah, it sounded like," She broke off. "Let's go see."</p><p>Now that their eyes had started to adjust to the gloom, they could start making out details. Akane and Ranma both looked to where they had heard a sound. Lying on the floor against the far corner was a naked body.</p><p>"Kimi!" Screamed Nabiki. She raced ahead of Ranma and Akane. When Ranma and Akane reached her she was holding a beaten and battered Kimi Ota in her arms. "Kimi." Nabiki pushed the other woman's hair away from her face. She flinched when she saw how badly beaten her face was. "Kimi. Talk to me. Please talk to me."</p><p>"N-nabs?" Came Kimi's weak voice. "Yo-you're here?"</p><p>"Who did this Kimi?" Demanded Nabiki. She placed one arm under Kimi's legs and stood taking the taller women with her. "Was it Satoh?"</p><p>Kimi nodded slightly. "Y-yeah. Satoh."</p><p>Nabiki, holding Kimi in her arms, turned to Ranma and Akane. "Find her." She hissed. "Find Satoh. I'll get Kimi to the infirmary."</p><p>"Not a problem." Ranma said grimly. "You want we should teach her to mess with your friends?"</p><p>"No." Replied Nabiki. "You find her and bring her to the roof, then get me." Nabiki growled. "If anyone is doing any teaching around here, it's going to be me."</p><p>"Go with her Tomboy." Ranma said. "I'll find Satoh."</p><p>"Don't hurt her Ranma." Akane said. She smiled coldly. "That's Nabiki's job."</p><p>Ranma snorted and raced off.</p><p>"Come on Nabiki." Akane said. "Let's get your girlfriend to the infirmary."</p><p>Nabiki nodded and started walking. She refused any help from Akane in carrying Kimi. "Don't worry baby." She whispered to Kimi as they walked. "I'll make them pay." They quickly reached the infirmary. Akane just grabbed the nearest nurse and hustled her to where Nabiki still held Kimi.</p><p>"She was beaten." Akane explained. "We found her in the showers." She grabbed the nurse by the front of her uniform. "Now you will treat her and do it quickly. I'm in no mood to argue."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma walked quickly around the prison. She knew where Satoh normally hung out and it was just a short time before she found Satoh and her two cronies. The three women were in Satoh's cell. From the sound of laughter it appeared they were replaying their earlier actions. Ranma walked into the cell. "That was not a very nice thing to do." She said.<p>Satoh looked up in surprise. Then she grinned nastily. "I was planning of saving you for last." Satoh said. The big woman stood. "Like dessert."</p><p>"Sorry but I think your menu is about to change." Ranma smiled coldly.</p><p>"Hey who turned on the air conditioning?" One of the women said suddenly. "It's freezing in here."</p><p>"Fuck that." Satoh advanced on Ranma. "You have got to be the dumbest broad on the planet. You just saved me a lot of trouble and you don't have Nabiki to protect your ass."</p><p>Ranma snorted. "I'm gonna let the three of you in on a little secret." Ranma walked over to Satoh and, almost negligently, knocked the big woman to her knees. "Nabiki isn't protecting me." Ranma explained. "I'm protecting her." She raised a knee into Satoh's face. Then she quickly turned on the other two women. It was a matter of seconds for Ranma to render all three women unconscious.</p><p>Satoh slowly came to consciousness. Her first thought was that she was blind but then she realized that it was just night. Her second realization was that she was outside. Her third was that Nabiki Tendo was staring angrily down at her. Satoh tried to surge to her feet but found, to her horror, that her legs wouldn't obey her.</p><p>"You're lucky." Nabiki hissed. "I don't kill people."</p><p>"I do." Muttered Ranma.</p><p>Satoh turned pale at Ranma's words. She stared at the red head in horror. The words were delivered with such conviction that Satoh couldn't not believe it to be the truth.</p><p>"That's why I'm doing this." Nabiki said. "Like I said, I don't kill people. But I have absolutely no problem with making someone wish they were never born." She grabbed Satoh by her hair and pulled. This was when Satoh realized that she couldn't speak either. Nabiki dragged Satoh across the roof top and Satoh had another realization. She was naked. "You hurt my friend." Nabiki said in a voice as cold as death itself. Nabiki continued to drag Satoh along the concrete rooftop. Finally she dragged Satoh back to where Ranma and Akane stood. "You can leave if you want sis." Nabiki said. "This is going to get ugly."</p><p>Akane cracked her knuckles. "You mean uglier than she already is?" Akane's laugh was completely devoid of humor. "Uh Uh. Someone got my big sister upset. You know how we Tendo's stick together." She said. Akane reached down and pulled Satoh to her feet. "God you're ugly." Akane spun Satoh around so she was facing Nabiki. She pushed. Satoh stumbled forward. Right into Nabiki's fist. Satoh crashed to the ground.</p><p>Ranma picked up Satoh. "Gettin uglier by the second." She spun Satoh around and pushed her toward Nabiki. This time she met Nabiki's foot. Every time she hit the ground either Ranma or Akane would pick her up and push her toward Nabiki. Finally a battered and dazed Satoh found herself leaning against a concrete wall. Nabiki stood in front of her. "Any last words?" Nabiki asked. She started punching.</p><p>"Well it may not be the chestnut fist." Ranma said in clinical detachment. "But it gets the job done."</p><p>"Think we should stop her?" Asked Akane.</p><p>"Do you think I'd stop if that had been you?" Ranma shot back. "I may not be the smartest guy on the planet. But even I know that Nabiki cares for Kimi."</p><p>"Yeah." Agreed Akane.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Warden Itsuro Kenichi glared at Sargent Yasuhara. "Three fights." He growled. "Three fights in less than a month. Four people in the infirmary. Do you have any idea what kind of ass reaming I am going to get over this?" The warden was an older man in his early sixties. His hair, what was left of it, was gray, almost white. He was thin almost to the point of emaciation. The expression on his face put one to mind of someone sucking on a lemon. 'This was supposed to be an easy job.' He thought in annoyance. 'It's a freaking woman's prison.'<p>Kenichi had just been assigned as warden to the prison. A veteran of over twenty years in the Japanese penal system, Kenichi had considered this last assignment as sort of a reward. Almost a semi-retirement before he really did retire. He was just starting to know the people who worked for him and some of what he was learning he didn't like.</p><p>"I wouldn't call the first one a fight." Yasuhara protested mildly. "More like two people getting acquainted."</p><p>"Don't give me that Yasuhara." the warden shot back. "You put Satoh in the hole because of it."</p><p>"Well, she did start it." The Sargent replied. "Tendo was pretty restrained I thought."</p><p>"Speaking of Tendo." The warden brushed at his thinning hair. "Why isn't she in the hole over this?"</p><p>The Sargent shrugged. "There's no evidence she had anything to do with it." She replied. "And until Satoh wakes up and tells us who did it. It could have been anybody." Yasuhara shrugged again. "I'm still trying to figure out how Satoh ended up on the roof."</p><p>The warden blew out an annoyed breath. "And that's another thing." He growled. "What kind of panty-assed security do we have around here? I want to know how she got there. I want to know where the hole is and I want it filled." The warden took another breath to calm himself. "Now what do you know about the drug trade in here?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kimi Ota opened her eyes. She wished she hadn't. She moaned as the pain of her battered body reasserted herself. She felt someone place a cool towel over her forehead. "Nabs?"<p>"Who else?" Nabiki sat on the edge of the hospital bed. "Welcome back."</p><p>"How?" Kimi swallowed. "How long was I out?" She finished.</p><p>"Couple days." Nabiki replied. "I talked to the doctor." Nabiki smiled reassuringly. "You lost a tooth, but other than that, you're going to be fine." Nabiki leaned closer. "Don't worry about Satoh." She whispered. "She's been taken care of."</p><p>"You didn't?" Kimi asked worriedly.</p><p>"She'll live." Nabiki replied coldly. "Don't worry, I wasn't about to sink to her level." She stood. "Now you listen to the doctor and get well. We have a date to keep when we get out of here." She leaned over and kissed Kimi on the lips. "I'm looking forward to it."</p><p>"Insatiable." Cracked Kimi.</p><p>"You know it." Nabiki replied. "Now get some rest. I'll be back tomorrow."</p><p>Nabiki walked out of the infirmary and made her way back toward her cell. She noticed idly that she was given a lot more space as she moved through the prison population. A surprising number of inmates gave her, what could only be described as, grateful smiles. Even so, no one spoke to her. Instead of going to her cell she walked into the one occupied by Ranma and Akane.</p><p>"Hey sis." Called Akane. "How's Kimi?"</p><p>"She's fine." Nabiki replied. She sat down on the lower bunk next to Akane. "How long have you known?" She asked.</p><p>Akane snorted. "About you and Kimi?" Nabiki nodded. "About a week." Akane grinned. "In the future use two pillows."</p><p>"Yeah Nabs." Agreed Ranma. "You're loud."</p><p>Nabiki blushed. "You're not upset?" She asked Akane.</p><p>"Oh please." Akane replied tartly. "My fiancé turns into a girl. Something I'm just beginning to appreciate." Ranma blushed. "Why would I be upset?"</p><p>"Surprised maybe." Ranma added. "Should have figured that Ice Queen would be attracted to another Ice Queen. You two are awfully alike you know." Ranma shuddered theatrically. "Nerima is doomed."</p><p>"Shut up Ranma." Akane took her sister's hand. "If she makes you happy, that's all that matters."</p><p>Nabiki smiled. "Thanks sis." She looked at the cell door as it opened. "Company."</p><p>"I figured I find all three of you here." Said a voice from the cell door. Akane and Ranma looked up. Sargent Yasuhara stood framed in the doorway. She walked in. Instead of walking over to Nabiki she walked straight to Ranma. She looked at the redhead for a second then threw a sharp, hard punch at Ranma's head. Ranma's hand shot up and stopped the punch. The redhead barely moved from the impact. "Holding out on me huh?" Yasuhara scratched her head. "According to a buddy of mine in Nerima." She said. "You're Ranma Saotome."</p><p>"I-I don't know what you're talking about." Stammered Ranma. "I'm Ranko Tendo."</p><p>"Save it." Yasuhara said. "Don't worry I'm not planning on exposing your little secret." She snorted. "I don't think anyone would believe me." She gave Ranma an inquiring look. "Heck, I don't believe it. " She gave Ranma an almost leer. "I don't care why kind of clothes you wear, there ain't no way you can hide those. One day I'd like you to tell me how you convinced people you're a guy."</p><p>"What do you want Yasuhara?" Nabiki asked. 'Okay she thinks Ranma is a cross-dresser. She doesn't believe in the curse. Let's keep it that way.' Nabiki let no trace of her thoughts show on her face.</p><p>"I'd be polite if I were you." Yasuhara said. "Right now you're facing ten days in the hole for fighting."</p><p>"Yeah?" Nabiki said cooly. "It'll be worth it. No one messes with my friends." Nabiki crossed her arms. "Now since I'm currently not in the hole, I suspect you're here for something else." Nabiki tilted her head. "What do you want?"</p><p>Yasuhara raised a hand palm up. "I'm not greedy. Ten percent of what you're making." She grinned. "I figured you were the kind of girl who knows how to get things. Even here."</p><p>"We don't bring in drugs." Nabiki said coldly.</p><p>"Now did I say anything about drugs?" Yasuhara said easily. "Actually that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Like I told you, I was one of Soun Tendo's students. I know Soun, he was a lot of things, martial artist, teacher," Yasuhara grinned. "Petty thief. He had a buddy, Genma Saotome. Does the name sound familiar?"</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Nabiki exchanged glances. "Maybe." Said Ranma.</p><p>"Genma and Soun were students to the same guy." Yasuhara continued. "Hap,"</p><p>"Don't say it." Ranma and Akane shouted in unison. "Just call him the old pervert." Ranma added. "Okay so maybe we know their teacher." Ranma said. "What's your point?</p><p>"The point is I know them, and even though Soun and Genma were both petty thieves, they had this thing about honor. A kind of a bent honor but they lived by it." Yasuhara leaned back against the cell door. "I've seen the two of them drop their loot in order to save someone's life." Yasuhara chuckled. "Of course they'd sometimes rob the person they just saved." Yasuhara's face turned serious. "But they never intentionally harmed anyone." She said. "And there's one more thing. They saved my life."</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Nabiki shared another long look. "What's the deal, Yasuhara?" Asked Nabiki. 'I can live with ten percent.' Nabiki thought. 'Now let's see what else she wants.'</p><p>"There's someone bringing drugs into the prison. I want it stopped. If I find out who is bringing in the drugs it'll do wonders for my career, I'll even put in a good word about you with the warden. Consider it repaying my debt to your Father. Cause if you don't, I can always break a petty smuggling ring." She looked at Ranma. "Are you really as good as they say you are?"</p><p>"Better." Ranma said in her cockiest voice.</p><p>"You have three months." Yasuhara stood. "Deal?"</p><p>"I don't think we have much of a choice." Nabiki replied. "Deal."</p><p>Yasuhara nodded. "Good." She turned to Ranma. "I'll expect to see you in the dojo tomorrow morning."</p><p>"I'll be there." Ranma shot back. "I hope your insurance is all paid up."</p><p>Yasuhara grinned and walked out of the cell.</p><p>"Well what do you know?" Nabiki said a moment later. "An honest, dishonest prison guard."</p><p>"Do you think we can trust her?" Asked Akane worriedly.</p><p>"No further than I can throw her." Nabiki replied. "But I think she hates drugs as much as we do." Nabiki nodded in decision. "We play along." She said. "For now." Nabiki checked to make sure no one was listening. "Obviously Yasuhara was told about your curse but is too," Nabiki grinned. "Rational to believe it. Keep it that way."</p><p>Akane and Ranma looked at each other, nodded and turned to Nabiki. "Sounds good." Said Ranma.</p><p>"In the meantime." Nabiki continued. A slow grin came to her face. "We have a smuggling ring to break." She said. "Not ours, of course."</p><p>"Of course." Chorused Ranma and Akane. "What about the Yasuhara's challenge?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Nabiki thought about it for a moment. "I don't suppose I can make you consider letting the Sargent win, can I?" She sighed as Ranma shook her head. "Well if you won't lose then how about not hurting her?" Suddenly Nabiki grinned. "On second thought, why don't you scare the shit out of her?"</p><p>Ranma grinned. "I can do that."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Prisoners Tendo Ranko and Tendo Akane to see Sergeant Yasuhara." Ranma announced to the guards the next day.<p>The guard looked at the diminutive form of Ranma in disbelief. "You?" She shook her head. She looked at a list. "Well your name is on here." She admitted. She looked at Akane. "Your's isn't." She said pointedly.</p><p>"I'm just here to help Ranko get back to her cell if she needs it." Akane said easily. "I could wait out here if you want."</p><p>The guard picked up a telephone and dialed a number. "Sargent?" The guard said. "I have two people here for one of your private interviews." The guard listened. "Yeah her and the baby sister." The guard listened and then laughed at something the sargent said. "Probably. Okay Sarge, I'll send'em in." The guard hung up the phone and turned to Ranma and Akane. "Okay. Sarge says he thinks he can trust Tendo's daughter." There was a buzz and a door opened. "Go on in."</p><p>Ranma and Akane both smiled at the guard, then each other. The two girls went through the door. Sargent Yasuhara stood at the far end of the dojo in a gi. In each of her hands, the stocky prison guard held a three foot wooden rod.</p><p>"Hi Sarge." Called Ranma cheerfully. "Studied Escrima, huh?" She pressed a finger against her chin. "I don't think you have to worry about l'il ol'me." She said in her cutest voice.</p><p>Sargent Yasuhara raised an eyebrow. "Where'd you learn the bimbo act?"</p><p>"A purple haired acquaintance of ours." Akane replied for Ranma. "Stop it Ranko." She scolded. "I doubt it will work as well on Sargent Yasuhara."</p><p>"Ya never know." Ranma replied. "Relax Sarge." Ranma said. "We're gonna spar." She nodded toward Akane. "Your choice for first; me or the Tomboy?"</p><p>"Which one would you recommend?" Sargent Yasuhara asked. 'Confident little shit, isn't she?" She thought to herself. 'Well I handled the older sister pretty easily. How much better could either of them be? They're only eighteen.' Yasuhara's contact in Nerima had given Yasuhara a pretty sketchy report but had pointed out some of the more interesting characteristics of Ranko Tendo AKA Ranma Saotome. Yasuhara ignored the more fantastic aspects of the reports and chalked them up to typical Ninja tricks; smoke bombs, hidden wires. She'd seen it before. 'An eighteen year old Ninjitsu is still only eighteen years old.'</p><p>"Oh I think the Tomboy could use the workout more'n me." Ranma replied. "But you did challenge me first." Ranma grinned and turned to Akane. "Sorry Tomboy. You'll have to wait for another time."</p><p>"Darn." Akane turned to Sargent Yasuhara. "I'll act as Referee, if you'd like." She told the Sargent with a grin.</p><p>"Not this time." Yasuhara jerked her head to the corner. "There's your gi."</p><p>Ranma ran over to the corner. A old grayish gi lay folded neatly in the corner. She quickly put it on. She turned around and started walking. Actually she waddled. "Hey Tomboy." She called. "Who do I remind you of?"</p><p>Akane grinned. "Well if the look were a little less intelligent, I'd say your father."</p><p>Yasuhara cleared her throat. She nodded toward the center of the dojo. "If you're done fooling around."</p><p>Ranma walked to the center of the dojo and got into an open stance. "Whenever your ready." Ranma wiped at her nose with her thumb. "Show me what ya got."</p><p>Sargent Yasuhara raised one stick and held it in front of her the other raised over her head. Yasuhara quickly closed the distance to the redhead and start spinning the escrima sticks, her wrists swinging the sticks in tight deadly arcs with practiced ease. Suddenly she struck with the stick in her right hand. It was a perfect attack and the stick sped unerringly toward Ranma's head.</p><p>The redhead seemed to blur and the stick sped through empty air. Yasuhara found herself off balance in surprise. There was a slight tap on the back of Yasuhara's head. She turned around. Ranma stood there with her tongue sticking out.</p><p>"Missed me." Taunted Ranma.</p><p>Yasuhara's eyes narrowed in anger. The sticks flashed and spun as Yasuhara chased Ranma around the dojo. Ranma backflipped, cartwheeled and bounced around the dojo, easily dodging all of the Sargent's blows. Ranma's laughter rang through the dojo. "Stand still and fight me, you little monkey." Growled Yasuhara.</p><p>Ranma stopped and faced Yasuhara. "Okay." Ranma charged.</p><p>Yasuhara swung both sticks at Ranma. The redheads hands flashed. There was a clatter against the far wall. Yasuhara looked at the escrima sticks. They had been split in half. The break was clean and even and looked as if it had been cut with a knife. Ranma stood a few feet away with her hands behind her back. "Oh." Ranma said in her cutest voice. "Did I bweak your wittle sticks?"</p><p>Yasuhara threw the sticks away. A grin came to the older woman's face. It wasn't a pleasant grin. "Been a long time since I had to work this hard." She growled. "I could take Soun, no reason why I can't take you."</p><p>"I could take Daddy." Akane said from the sidelines. "Even before Ranm, Ranko started training me." Akane smiled coldly. "If you ask nice, maybe Ranko could train you." Akane stood and walked over to stand between the two combatants. "You're not even in my league." Akane said confidently.</p><p>"I'm the best Soun ever trained." Yasuhara spat, stung by Akane's words..</p><p>"Really?" Akane raised her hands. "Can you do this?" Akane's hands started to glow redly and Yasuhara could feel the heat coming off them. "I'm sure you've heard of chi."</p><p>"A trick." Yasuhara sneered. "No one can really control their chi like that."</p><p>Akane extended one glowing hand. "A trick huh?" She said. "Take my hand if you think it's just a trick."</p><p>Yasuhara extended her hand. Then pulled it back suddenly. "Shit." She exclaimed. "That's hot."</p><p>"Exactly." Akane said. "Notice my hands aren't burning. Notice I don't feel the heat. Face it Sargent, it's no trick."</p><p>"Ah that's nothin." Ranma walked over to the wall and turned off one of the overhead lights. The room was dim but not dark. Yasuhara frowned as Ranma walked back to stand about ten feet from the Sargent. She pulled her arms into her body and her face seemed to become vacant. "Now you see me," Ranma's voice seemed to fade. Then to the Sargent's astonishment, Ranma faded as well. Ranma's face stayed visible longer than the rest of her body. "Now you don't." Ranma vanished.</p><p>"What?" Yasuhara raced over to where Ranma had been standing. The diminutive redhead was gone! "Oh shit." She looked around wildly. "Where'd she go?" She demanded of Akane.</p><p>Akane grinned. "Neat," Akane's grin widened. "Trick. Huh, Sargent?" Akane pointed to a corner. "There she is."</p><p>Yasuhara spun around. No one was there. "Very funny." She said.</p><p>"Keep looking." Akane said almost commanded. Yasuhara's eyes widened as a form seemed to coalesce out of the shadows. Ranma stepped out of the corner of the room. "Ranko is the premier living chi adept on the planet." Akane said proudly.</p><p>"Hey Herb is pretty good." Ranma replied modestly.</p><p>"Herb?" Asked the Sargent in an almost numb voice. She licked her lips. "Who's Herb?"</p><p>"Never mind." Akane said quickly. "You're not in our league Sargent." Akane repeated. "Now we could go on pretending but that wouldn't be fair. To you."</p><p>"The offer still stands." Ranma said. "I can train you." She shrugged. "Whether you can match what even the Tomboy can do is another story." Ranma smiled. "To be honest, I'd rather train ya than fight ya."</p><p>Yasuhara swallowed. 'They're like something out of a bad kung fu movie.' She thought in disbelief. "Do you think I could learn that?" She asked a moment later.</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Ya never know." She replied. "Either way, you'll be better than ya are now."</p><p>End Chapter 5</p><p>Authors Notes: Thanks again for all the reviews. I think this chapter answers a few criticisms made by some reviewers. Title notwithstanding, this story could not just be about Nabiki running a scam in the prison. I hope you liked this one.</p>
