</div><p>Chapter 3</p><p>'Weekend at Kuno's'</p><p>"Good evening and welcome to Japan Tonight, I'm your host, Saatchi Kato." The reporter had a sad expression on her face. "Kodachi Kuno. The Black Widow." She said as an image appeared on the screen behind her. Kodachi Kuno in black and wearing a veil. "It's been over a year and still she mourns." She said. "Who hasn't heard the story by now? Can even the most cynical deny that this was a once in a lifetime love?" The reporter sighed. "Except for the occassional public viewing and always with her companion, Noriko Mata," The image changed to one of Noriko. "Kodachi Kuno, once Japan's greatest socialite has become a virtual recluse." The reporter smiled slightly. "Much to the dismay of much of Japan's high society." She said. "Tonights' Topic: Kodachi Kuno and Ky Young Ji. The greatest love story ever told?" She said. "Right after these messages."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Friday afternoon came and Kodachi and Noriko were again at the club going through some ledgers when Kodachi's private phone rang. Noriko picked up the phone. "Hello?" Noriko said. Her eyes widened. "Kinnikun?" She exclaimed.</p><p>"Give me that." Kodachi demanded. She almost grabbed for the phone. "Kinnikun?" She said into the phone. "This is a surprise." She listened. "You're what?" Kodachi grabbed a pen and a pad. "Eight fifteen." Kodachi cupped the mouthpiece. "Kinnikun is coming into town tonight." She said excitedly.</p><p>"Yes!" Exclained Noriko. "How long is he staying?"</p><p>"I hope you can stay more than a night." Kodachi said into the phone. "You can?" She said. "Wonderful." She smiled. "I'll have a car waiting for you." She said. "We can't wait to see you." She said. Kodachi disconnected. She looked at her watch. "Oh gods, we have less than two hours to get ready."</p><p>"We?" Noriko said in amusement. "You sure you don't want him all to yourself this weekend?" She asked. "Not that I don't want to see him too but..."</p><p>"Nonsense Noriko." Kodachi replied firmly. "Kinnikun distinctly said he was looking forward to seeing both of us." She said. "And both of us is who he will see." Kodachi walked over to the couch and sprawled into it. "Besides, it's safer this way." She said softly.</p><p>"Falling for him, huh?" Noriko asked. "You don't have to answer, it's obvious." Noriko sat on the arm of the couch closest to Kodachi's head. Noriko reached down with a hand and started to stroke Kodachi's head. "It's okay honey." Noriko said. "I understand." She said gently. "There's no rush." Noriko smiled. "Except for getting ready for Kinnikun." She stood. "Come on, baby, times a wasting."</p><p>Kodachi laughed and got to her feet. "Have I ever told you, you're an impertinent imp?" Kodachi walked over to the desk and picked up her veil. She looked at it for a long moment, then, with a sigh, put it on. "I still miss him." She said quietly.</p><p>Noriko walked up behind Kodachi and put her hands on Kodachi's shoulders. "I know, Dachi." Noriko said. "I do too."</p><p>Kodachi reached up with a hand and took one of Noriko's hands. They didn't say anything, something they both appreciated. Unspoken was an understanding of a shared loss. Kodachi had long ago realized she had replaced Noriko as Ky's 'Number one girl'. Noriko had as much admitted it a number of times. Noriko had long ago realized that she had lost out to the right girl. In a strange way it helped; both of them.</p><p>Kodachi dropped Noriko's hand and the two women straightened. "Goodness, we're going to have to hurry." Kodachi said briskly. She smiled behind her veil. "We wouldn't want to keep Kinnikun waiting."</p><p>"Translation, you're horny and you're planning to jump his bones in the limo." Noriko cracked.</p><p>"That's what I said." Kodachi agreed. She laughed.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Yuki walked quickly to the library. She knocked. "It's Yuki, My Lady." Yuki opened the door and entered. "You wanted to see me, ?" Yuki asked. "Good afternoon, Ms. Mata. Mr. Honda." Noriko and Kinnikun nodded in greeting then went back to talking quietly to each other.</p><p>"Yes Yuki." Kodachi said. "Makoto's Genji Morimoto will be having dinner with us tonight."</p><p>"Yes, My Lady." Yuki agreed.</p><p>"And my Brother and his two ladies as well." Continued Kodachi.</p><p>"Yes, My Lady." Yuki agreed again.</p><p>"Well, with the unexpected visit from , I decided a more formal dinner than I had originally planned was appropriate." Kodachi said. Kodachi waved a hand in a sort of shrug. "But now we have a problem." Kodachi said with a slight frown. "The table is too uneven for a formal dinner, I was thinking of asking Miki but she has a slight cold."</p><p>"I'd be honored to volunteer, My Lady." Yuki interrupted.</p><p>"I didn't want to impose." Kodachi said apologetically. "But..."</p><p>"Oh it's quite all right, My Lady." Yuki said. Her hand went to her pendant. "I know how important it is to get Mr. Morimoto's assistance." She said.</p><p>"Thank you, Yuki." Kodachi nodded her head.</p><p>"You're most welcome, My Lady." Yuki replied. "If you'll excuse me, I need to find something appropriate to wear." With a short, though respectful bow, Yuki left the library.</p><p>Kodachi walked back to the couch. "Now." She asked as she sat down. "Where were we?"</p><p>"You were about to suggest doing something terribly naughty." Noriko said.</p><p>"Oh yes, that's right." Kodachi agreed.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The limousine pulled up in front of the Kuno mansion. The driver got out and opened the passenger door. A distinguished and fit looking middle-aged man got out then reached a hand in. The second passenger's long legs swung out and still holding the man's hand stood. "That was terribly naughty of you Genji." Makoto said as they ascended the stairs to the mansion entrance. "I'm sure I look a mess."</p><p>"I don't think that is possible, Makoto." Genji Morimoto replied cheerfully. Fit, lean and tanned, Genji Morimoto looked years younger than the fifty he actually carried.</p><p>"Flatterer." Makoto giggled. "And a terrible liar." She leaned over and kissed the top of Genji's head. "Don't stop." She said quietly. Genji chuckled. "I'm so excited, Genji." Makoto bubbled. "Imagine the Ice Queen wants to talk to my Genji." She said proudly. "I just know the two of you will hit it off."</p><p>The door to the Kuno mansion opened as they reached the top landing and Kodachi Kuno stood in the doorway. As usual she was dressed in black and a short veil covered the top half of her face. "Mr. Morimoto." Kodachi greeted the older man. "It is so good of you to come." She waved the couple into the mansion. "I know you've had a long drive, so why don't the two of you go to your suite?" She said. Kodachi looked at Makoto. "I'm sure you'll both wish to freshen up before dinner." She said with an amused smile. "It's the Red Suite, Makoto." She told Makoto. "I'll have Yuki get you when it's time for dinner."</p><p>"Thank you, Ms. Kuno." Genji Morimoto said politely. "Until later." Makoto reclaimed Genji's arm and they walked off toward the long stairway to the second floor.</p><p>Makoto led Genji down a long hallway and stopped at a door. "Here we are." Makoto said. She opened the door and the couple walked in. Genji Morimoto was wealthy. He had to be in order to afford someone like Makoto. An astute business man and investor he had a fortune that few could rival. He was used to being surrounded by the rare and valuable. The beautiful. He had thought envy was something for others. "My gods." Genji said in awe.</p><p>The Red Suite was so named for the dark, rich reddish hue of the wood paneled walls and floors. The hand-woven rugs were predominantly red as well. Artwork and other art objects continued the reddish theme. Genji walked over to one object in particular. A red lacquered suit of armor. "It's real." He said after a long moments scrutiny. "And it's had some use." He said. Genji looked around. "Ms. Kuno honors me greatly."</p><p>"You deserve it Genji." Makoto said firmly. "You're a very important man." She said. "And Ms. Kuno knows it."</p><p>"Now Makoto, I'm just a businessman." Genji said modestly though pleased with Makoto for saying it. "I'm nobody special."</p><p>"Tell that to someone who doesn't know you." Makoto replied with a laugh. "Just a businessman." She rolled her eyes. "That's like saying Ranma Saotome is just a martial artist." She reached over and loosened Genji tie. "Now, enough talking, we have just enough time for you to take a nap before dinner." She waved her hands. "Go on." Genji laughed and headed for the bedroom. "And remove your jacket first." Makoto called after him. "That man." She complained fondly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Yuki knocked on the door of the Red Suite. The door opened and Makoto stood framed in the doorway. "Hey Makoto." Yuki called in greeting. The two women gave each other a quick embrace and a kiss on the cheek. "You have fifteen minutes."</p><p>Makoto nodded and waved Yuki into the suite. "Fifteen minutes, Genji." Makoto called. She turned back to Yuki. "Nice outfit." Makoto said in appreciation. She waved her hand to indicate the gold and black evening dress Yuki was wearing. "Hot date?" She asked teasingly.</p><p>Yuki blushed slightly. "Well, sort off." Yuki replied. "Oyabun Honda came into town yesterday and, well with Lord Kuno, the Ice Queen and Kimi Ota, Ms. Kuno decided Mr. Morimoto might feel uncomfortable so..."</p><p>"You?" Makoto interrupted in amazement. "She picked you to be Genji's date?"</p><p>"Well, I kind of volunteered." Yuki admitted. "I hope you don't mind..."</p><p>"Mind?" Makoto laughed. "Of course I don't mind." She said. "You're perfect."</p><p>"Who's perfect?" Genji asked from the doorway of the bedroom. He was now dressed in a tuxedo though his tie was undone. Makoto walked over and started doing Genji's tie.</p><p>"Yuki." Makoto explained. She tossed her head toward the female retainer. "It seems that one of the Ice Queen's business partners is visiting." She leaned forward. "Kinnikun Honda, I told you about him." Genji nodded. "Well Ms. Kuno didn't want you to feel out of place so she got you a second dinner date." She patted down Genji's tie. "There, you look very handsome." She turned to Yuki. "Doesn't he Yuki?"</p><p>"Very handsome." Agreed Yuki.</p><p>"Good." Makoto looped her arm through Genji's. They exited the suite. "You take his other arm, Yuki." Makoto said firmly. "Yuki is one of my best friends among the girls, Genji." She said. "And I know I can trust her." They walked down the hallway and to the stairs. "Besides, Yuki is cute." She said. "You do think she's cute, don't you?"</p><p>"Very." Genji said in amused tones. "As long as you're happy about it." He added. "You know I like to make you happy."</p><p>Makoto sighed happily. "See why I love him?" She said to Yuki. "He says things like that all the time."</p><p>Yuki nodded. 'okay, so he's good looking, smart, wealthy and a sweet-talker.' Yuki thought to herself. 'That would be more than enough, so why do I think there's more to it than that?' Yuki shrugged internally. 'Oh well, I'll get it out of her eventually.' Yuki led Genji and Makoto to the first floor. "We'll be dining in the small dining room." Yuki said conversationally. She led them to a set of doors and opened it. It led not into a dining room but something like a small library. A bar stood off in one corner and there were a number of people sitting in a conversation nook or standing just next to it.</p><p>"Mr. Morimoto." Kodachi approached quickly. "It's so good of you to come." She said.</p><p>"Thank you for inviting me." Genji replied. "Makoto speaks fondly of the times she's been priviledged to stay here." He said. "I begin to understand." He tilted his head. "The armor?" He inquired with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>"My great, great grandfather first wore it." Kodachi replied proudly. Kodachi smiled. "But here I am monopolizing your time when I should be introducing you to my other guests." Kodachi waved a hand and led Genji and Makoto over to conversation nook. "Everyone, our final guests have arrived." Kodachi waved a hand toward a tall, powerfully built man with shaggy black hair. "Genji Morimoto, my Brother, Tatewaki Kuno."</p><p>"Lord Kuno." Genji bowed politely. "This is an honor, a great honor."</p><p>"Mine as well." Tatewaki rumbled. "May I introduce my Ladies?" He said. "My betrothed, the Lady Nabiki Tendo." He smiled. "Some know her as the Ice Queen." He said.</p><p>"I prefer Nabiki." Nabiki interrupted. She extended a hand. "My friends call me Nabs."</p><p>"I hope one day to be so fortunate." Genji replied taking the hand and shaking it. "I must admit I'd been hoping to meet you one day."</p><p>"And here you are." Nabiki replied. She waved a hand to the attractive blond standing next to her. "Have you met my companion, Kimi Ota?"</p><p>"No," Replied Genji. "But I've been hearing her name." He said. "Usually in conjunction with your name." He bowed to Kimi. "An honor." Kimi returned the bow.</p><p>Kodachi waved her hand again. "And I know you remember Noriko Mata."</p><p>"Ms. Mata. A pleasure to see you again." Genji replied. Noriko bowed politely.</p><p>"And our other guest." Kodachi indicated the remaining guest. He was a thick set and distinguished looking man at most ten years Genji's junior. The man rose. "Mr. Kinnikun Honda."</p><p>Genji raised an eyebrow. "Mr. Kinnikun Honda?" Genji replied. "Shouldn't that be, Oyabun Kinnikun Honda, from Hokkaido?" Kinnikun nodded slowly. A hush seemed to descend on the room. Genji's mouth worked for a second then he looked at Makoto. He smiled at Makoto before returning his attention to Kinnikun. Genji smiled a smile that was reminiscent of one often seen on Nabiki Tendo's face. "I have a feeling this will be a most profitable evening." He said. Genji bowed. "A pleasure, Oyabun Honda."</p><p>"The pleasure is mine." Kinnikun Honda replied. He chuckled. "Morimoto Transport." He said musingly. "Perfect."</p><p>"Now, now, no business before dinner." Kodachi admonished. "And that includes you Lady Tendo." Nabiki laughed in response.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Dinner was, in Genji's opinion, magnificient. "Your chef is a wizard." Genji declared at the end of the meal. "An absolute wizard." There were exclamations of agreement and Cook, much to the burly chef's embarrassment, was brought out and applauded by the guests. After dinner the guests moved back to the small library where they had gathered before dinner. Genji found himself seated in a very comfortable chair.</p><p>"Cigar?" Nabiki asked. She extended a box.</p><p>"Oh please, Genji." Makoto said. "Let me." She looked at the cigars in the box and selected one. Makoto rolled the cigar with her fingers, next to her ear. She nodded. There was a small device in the box, something like a nail clipper, that Makoto removed and expertly clipped off one end. Makoto puffed the cigar alight before offering it to Genji. "Genji taught me that." Makoto confided to Yuki. "Genji teaches me everything."</p><p>"Excellent cigar." Genji said after a moment. He chuckled. "One of yours, Oyabun Honda?" The Yakuza lord nodded. Genji smiled. "So," He said. "What's in it for me?"</p><p>"Ten percent of the profits." Nabiki said briskly. "Provided you can deliver."</p><p>"Oh I can deliver." Genji promised. "But not at ten percent." He puffed the cigar. "Thirty-five percent." Genji smiled shark-like.</p><p>"You'd ruin me." Nabiki replied. Her smile matched Genji's. "I might be willing to go to twelve percent." She said doubtfully.</p><p>"Thirty-Two." Genji shot back. "Moving this will be difficult and dangerous."</p><p>"Fifteen." Nabiki's smile widened. "And I doubt it will be all that difficult." She said. "I'm sure you're no stranger to difficult."</p><p>"But still dangerous." Genji puffed the cigar. "Shall we stop dancing, Ice Queen?" He said. "Twenty-five?"</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Twenty-five will be acceptable." She inclined her head toward Genji. "I foresee a long and profitable relationship, Mr. Morimoto."</p><p>"And I have something to, as they say, sweeten the deal." Kodachi added. "It appears that Makoto's other clients have seen fit to move on." Kodachi said. "Normally I would be looking for a replacement or two but I think, in this case, it won't be necessary." She smiled as Makoto clapped her hands gleefully. "I see Makoto is agreeable." Kodachi sighed. "We'll miss her at the club, but I hope you'll see fit to allow her to visit now and then."</p><p>Makoto stopped clapping and a stricken look appeared on her face. "Miss me? Visit?" She said in shock. "But. But." Suddenly Makoto stood. "No!" She shouted. "I never said," Makoto broke off. "Ms. Kuno how could you?" Makoto exclaimed tearfully. Her hand went to the pendant around her neck. She pulled it off and threw it to the floor. "No." She said again and ran out of the room.</p><p>"My Lady." Yuki said in reproving anger and raced after Makoto.</p><p>Stunned by the suddeness, Kodachi did not react at once, when she did her gaze fell on the fallen pendant. Kodachi stooped and picked it up. "I-I." stammered Kodachi. Then without a word she ran out of the room. Kodachi hurried toward the Red suite in hopes that was Makoto's destination. She stopped at the door then hesitantly knocked. "Makoto?" Kodachi siald. "Makoto are you in there?" She said. Kodachi pressed her ear against the door. "Yuki? Yuki if you're in there, please, please open the door." Kodachi stepped back. Her hands twisted nervously together. Kodachi felt something in her hands and looked down. The pendant. The door slowly opened.</p><p>"My Lady." Yuki said in sombre greeting.</p><p>"Please let me in, Yuki." Kodachi said pleadingly. "I must speak to her." Yuki stepped back slowly. "Thank you." Kodachi said gratefully. She walked through the suite and into the bedroom.</p><p>Makoto looked up from the bed. "You didn't ask." Makoto said angrily. "You treated me like a whore."</p><p>"Yes." Kodachi said in a whisper. "Forgive me." Kodachi pleaded.</p><p>"I thought I was part of something, something good. Something important." Makoto shook her head. "It was a lie."</p><p>Kodachi hung her head. "Yes." She whispered again. Kodachi raised her head and lifted her veil. "Forgive me, Makoto." She extended both hands with the pendant nestled between them. "Please Makoto, take this back." She begged. "Take this back and make it not a lie."</p><p>Makoto made no move to reclaim the pendant. "I like working at the club." Makoto said. "That's where my friends are." She said. "Would you want to give up your friends, your family?"</p><p>Kodachi shook her head. "No." She whispered. "I'll take back the offer, I'll do anything, just..." Kodachi broke off. "I'm so sorry, Makoto."</p><p>"Did you know the other girls, the regular girls, all think being one of Ms. Kuno's girls, is something special?" Makoto said. She reached out a hand and took the pendant. "I was so proud when you gave me this." She looked at the pendant. "I want to be proud of it again." Makoto said. "But how can I?"</p><p>"Would you pledge your honor, My Lady?" Yuki asked. "As Lady to vassal?" Yuki said. "For isn't that what they are? What they should be?" Kodachi's eyes widened, then she nodded in agreement. Yuki looked at Makoto. "The Kuno are many things, but they've always understand their responsibilities to their vassals." Yuki took the pendant from Makoto and offered it to Kodachi. "Isn't that true, My lady?"</p><p>Kodachi took the pendant. She held it out. "Redeem my honor, Makoto." She said. "Make us both proud again." Makoto bowed her head and Kodachi placed the pendant around Makoto's neck. The two women bowed to each other. "Thank you, Makoto." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Am I supposed to call you My Lady, now?" Makoto said with small smile.</p><p>"I suppose." Kodachi replied. "But somehow it doesn't seem, oh I don't know, appropriate." Kodachi shook her head. "No, I think I prefer, Ms. Kuno."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The guests looked up as the door to the small library opened. Makoto entered first, followed by Yuki then Kodachi. Kodachi walked over and stood in front of Genji Morimoto. Kodachi bowed. "Please forgive me, Mr. Morimoto." She said. "I must take back my offer of before, it was not mine to give."</p><p>"I love you, Genji, really I do." Makoto said. "Please don't make me give up the club."</p><p>Genji looked at Kodachi. "Even if our entire deal hinges on it?" He asked quietly. Kodachi nodded firmly. "I see." Genji inclined his head in respect. He looked at Makoto. "So, pretty Makoto, it seems you'll continue to work at the club." He said. "Though I would have liked the exclusiveness." He said to Kodachi.</p><p>"That is not mine to offer as well." Kodachi said. "That too belongs to Makoto."</p><p>"I'll be faithful, Genji." Makoto said eagerly. "I promise."</p><p>Genji looked at Nabiki. "Twenty-five percent, was it?"</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "It was."</p><p>Genji nodded in return. "Excellent." He said. Genji stood. "I will be in touch, Ice Queen." He bowed. "If you'll excuse us?" Makoto linked her arm through Genji's. "I think we'll turn in." He bowed. "Until tomorrow."</p><p>Yuki held the door open for Genji and Makoto. She yelped in surprise when Makoto grabbed her hand and pulled her along. "Hey." She exclaimed.</p><p>Makoto giggled. "The evening isn't over." She said. "You should at least walk us to our room." She said. "Isn't that right, Genji?" Genji raised an eyebrow then nodded. "See?" She said to Yuki. "Now you take Genji's other arm." She ordered. Yuki hesitantly took Genji's arm and they continued walking along the corridor. "Did I tell you Yuki is one of my best friends?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"You mentioned it." Genji replied genially.</p><p>"I didn't realize how good a friend until tonight." Makoto continued. They reached the Red Suite and Makoto opened the door. "Does anyone besides me want a drink?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"A short one, Makoto." Genji said. He sat down on the couch in the main part of the suite.</p><p>"I should go." Yuki began.</p><p>"Come on, just a little drink." Makoto pleaded. "Genji doesn't mind." She said. "Do you baby?" She cooed to Genji. Genji chuckled and shook his head. "See?" Makoto went over to the bar. "Now if I remember correctly, you like cognac." She looked at Yuki standing at the door. "Come on Yuki, stay awhile."</p><p>"But don't you two want to be alone?" Yuki asked.</p><p>"Now is that any way for one of Ms. Kuno's girls to act?" Makoto walked over with a glass and handed it to Yuki. "You're supposed to stay until the client tells you to go." Makoto raised her own glass. "And Genji hasn't told you to go yet."</p><p>Yuki blushed. "I'm sure Mr. Morimoto..." Yuki began.</p><p>"Genji." Makoto said firmly.</p><p>"I'm sure Mr. Mor-Genji wasn't expecting, I mean, you don't think, do you?" She looked at Genji. "Did you?" Genji shook his head. "See?" Yuki pointed out.</p><p>"Of course, now that I think of it, I can see Makoto's point." Genji loosened his tie and leaned back against the couch. "Stand next to each other." Genji said. Makoto drained her glass and stood next to Yuki. Genji chuckled. "She barely comes to your shoulder, Makoto."</p><p>"Yeah, but she's awful cute." Makoto replied. "Besides, I like her, Genji."</p><p>"So you keep telling me." Genji sipped his drink. "I have to admit, she is cute. Not what I'm normally attracted to, but cute nonetheless."</p><p>"Excuse me, but are you guys talking about what I think you're talking about?" Yuki asked in a squeak.</p><p>Makoto nodded. "Um hmm." She said cheerfully. "I promised Genji a second girl but I never found anyone I thought I could trust around Genji." Makoto said. "Besides, don't you want to know Genji's secret?" She asked teasingly.</p><p>"Yes, but." Yuki began but was stopped when Makoto kissed her full on the mouth. "Makoto?" Yuki exclaimed when Makoto broke the kiss. "Genji..." She began again when Makoto kissed her again. "Whoa." Breathed Yuki. She reached up and grabbed Makoto by the back of the head and pulled her down and kissed her.</p><p>"Whoa." Makoto said when Yuki released her. She turned her head and looked at Genji. "See, I told you she'd be perfect." She told the older man.</p><p>"So you did." Genji stood. "Bedroom. Now." He ordered.</p><p>"Yes, Genji." Makoto and Yuki chorused.</p><p>End Chapter 3</p><p>Author's Notes: Thought I'd give you this one a little early. Sorry, no lemon.</p>
