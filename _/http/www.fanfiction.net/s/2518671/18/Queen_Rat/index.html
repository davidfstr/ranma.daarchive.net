</div><p>Chapter 18</p><p>'Training Days part 2'</p><p>Hello Ms. Kuonji." Said Lt. Noriudo. "How are you feeling?" He asked in a gruff voice.</p><p>"Better Lieutenant." Ukyo replied. "I was beginning to think you forgot about me." Ukyo smiled as Kasumi brought over a tray. On the tray were three glasses of lemonade. Kasumi gave one to the lieutenant and place a second on a table next to Ukyo. Kasumi took the third and sat down on a chair next to the couch Ukyo was resting on. She stretched her arm. Ukyo suppressed a slight wince. She rested her arm on her lap. Ukyo took the lemonade with her other hand. "There're some bad guys to catch."</p><p>"Just wanted you to recover some." He looked at Ukyo with concern. "According to Dr. Tofu you've healed enough to join your two friends."</p><p>"Alright!" Ukyo chortled. "I can't wait to see them." Ukyo sighed. "It wouldn't have hurt to let them call me once in a while." She grumbled. "Your reports don't tell me much, you know."</p><p>"I agree." Added Kasumi. "We all understand why you can't tell us where they are but you certainly can tell us more than just 'they're fine'." Kasumi complained. "We worry."</p><p>'No kidding.' Ukyo thought to herself. 'The two of them started getting awful quiet just before they left.' Ukyo sipped her lemonade moodily. "So." She said. "When do I leave?"</p><p>"Tomorrow morning." The lieutenant replied. "Pack one suitcase." The lieutenant smiled wryly. "Just don't forget your spatula."</p><p>"As if." Ukyo snorted. "Why not right now?' She asked a moment later. "I can pack a suitcase in no time."</p><p>"Now Ukyo." Kasumi admonished. "You must allow us to give you a proper good-bye." Kasumi rose. "Thank you Lieutenant." She said graciously. "You're welcome to join us."</p><p>Lt. Noriudo rose. "Thank you but I'll pass." He said. "Eight a.m." He told Ukyo. Kasumi escorted the lieutenant to the door. When she returned she found Ukyo stretching her arm and shoulder.</p><p>"Are you sure you're ready?" Kasumi asked in concern. "A bullet wound is not something that heals overnight."</p><p>"Ready enough." Ukyo said firmly. "Heck even if I wasn't I'm not about to put off seeing those two any more than I have to." Ukyo smiled guiltily. "I'm worried about them." She said quietly.</p><p>"I know Ukyo." Kasumi sat down next to Ukyo. "We all are." Kasumi smiled at Ukyo. "Ranma and Akane are lucky to have a friend like you."</p><p>Ukyo took a swallow of her lemonade. The glass covered her expression. 'With friends like me,' Ukyo thought. She put the glass down and smiled back at Kasumi. "Yeah, well you know how it is."</p><p>"Yes I do." Kasumi said softly. She stood up. "Now what would you like for your farewell dinner?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The unmarked van pulled up in front of a nondescript apartment building. Lt. Noriudo stepped out of the passenger side and then opened the sliding van door. Ukyo stepped out blinking in the midmorning sun. She looked at the building. "This is where we're staying?" She asked. She reached into the van and pulled out her suitcase and battle spatula. She slung the spatula across her back.<p>"Only for the next week or so." Lt. Noriudo replied. "Ranma and Akane are still training and you haven't even started." He said. "You'll be spending the next few days developing your cover identity." He started walking toward the building.</p><p>"Which will be?" Ukyo prompted as she followed.</p><p>"Obviously we want to take advantage of your skill in impersonating a man." The lieutenant replied. "But it has to be one that allows you to be in constant association with Ranma and Akane while they are in their covers."</p><p>Ukyo rolled her eyes. 'It's like pulling teeth.' She thought in annoyance. "And their cover identities are?" She asked impatiently.</p><p>Lt. Noriudo grinned. "Why don't I let them tell you themselves." He said with a chuckle. He opened the door to the apartment building. "Second floor." He said. He and Ukyo ascended the stairway. They stopped at a door. "This is your apartment. Ranma and Akane are next door." He handed Ukyo a key. "Put your gear away." He said.</p><p>Ukyo unlocked the door and placed her suitcase just inside the door. "Uk-chan!" Yelled a voice. Ranma ran out of his apartment and swept Ukyo into a hug. "Damn it's good to see you." He said.</p><p>Ukyo let herself enjoy the sensation of being wrapped in Ranma's arms before answering. "Same here sugar." Ukyo said. "Where's Akane?" She asked a moment later.</p><p>"Right here Ukyo." Akane said from the doorway of her apartment. "Come on in." She said. "I have some tea made." Akane turned and disappeared into the apartment.</p><p>Ranma slung an arm around Ukyo's shoulders and led her to the apartment. "We can take it from here lieutenant." Ranma said over his shoulder. "We gotta a lot of catching up to do."</p><p>"Ukyo starts her training tomorrow." Noriudo said to their retreating backs. "The van will be here bright and early." He chuckled as Ranma waved an acknowledging hand without looking back. "Well the team is complete." He said as he walked away. A satisfied smile came to his face. "Good."</p><p>Ranma led Ukyo into the apartment. He kept his arm around her shoulders as they sat on the couch. Akane came out of the kitchen a minute later with several mugs. Ukyo picked up a mug and sipped. She looked at Akane over the rim of the mug. 'She seems a bit subdued but okay.' She realized. "So," Ukyo said. "How's it been going?"</p><p>Akane looked at Ranma before answering. "Okay." She said finally. "The training takes up a lot of our time." Akane seemed to flush slightly. She gave Ukyo a lopsided smile. "You'll see tomorrow."</p><p>"Yeah Uk-chan." Ranma added. "And just wait until you see the disguise we came up for you."</p><p>"Sounds mysterious." Ukyo said with a smile. "How about giving me a hint."</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Nah. That would spoil the surprise." Ranma looked at Ukyo. "Well we're together again." He said in pleased tones. He squeezed Ukyo's shoulders tightly. He released her quickly when Ukyo made a pained sound. "Your shoulder still bothering you?" He asked in concern.</p><p>Ukyo shrugged one shouldered. "Yeah, it's taking a little longer to heal than I expected." She smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry Ran-chan, I'm fine." She said. "Besides, your family is great and all that Akane, but I'm really glad to be out of there." Ukyo snapped her fingers. "Oh that reminds me. I have a ton of letters for the two of you." She made to get up but Ranma held her down.</p><p>"Later." He told her. "Come here Tomboy." Ranma said and waved his free arm. Akane walked over and sat down next to Ranma. He put his arm around her shoulders. "Now this is the way it should be." He said contentedly. "The three of us, together again."</p><p>Ukyo looked across Ranma to Akane. 'She isn't getting mad.' She observed. Ukyo shrugged internally. 'Well I'm not going to complain if she won't.' Ukyo sighed happily.</p><p>Akane looked across Ranma to Ukyo then at Ranma. 'They both look so damn happy.' She thought. Akane sighed moodily. "Yeah." Akane said. "The three of us, together again. Just like old times."</p><p>The next morning the van came to pick the three of them up and take them to their training. "What kind of training have you guys been doing?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"You'll see when we get there, Uk-chan." Ranma replied with a laugh. "Personally I can't wait to see how you look in disguise." She grinned. "It was my idea." She added a moment later. "Ow." Ranma rubbed her side where Akane elbowed her.</p><p>"Pervert." Grumbled Akane.</p><p>Ranma laughed again. "Yep." She replied. "And you wouldn't want me any other way." She said. "Right?"</p><p>"Right." Akane said in resignation. "Much as I hate to admit it Ranma's idea made a lot of sense Ukyo." She smirked at Ukyo. "Besides it suits you."</p><p>The van pulled up in front of the converted warehouse. As had become her habit, Gigi was waiting at the front door. She gave Ranma and Akane a smile and peered curiously at Ukyo. "So is this the mysterious Ukyo?" She asked.</p><p>"Mysterious?" Ukyo echoed. "Ran-chan what have you been saying about me?"</p><p>Ranma raised her hands defensively. "Hey Noriudo said not to say anything." She replied. "Gigi this is Ukyo." Ranma said in formal introduction. "Ukyo. Gigi." The two women nodded to each other.</p><p>Gigi gave Ukyo an appraising look. "Well you are a little bit masculine looking but," She smiled. "I think I expected someone a bit more," Gigi paused for a moment. "Butch." She said finally. "In a dress you'd make a pretty attractive woman."</p><p>"Yeah but in pants she's a great looking guy." Ranma replied. "It's one of the things I liked best about her." She gave Ukyo a big smile.</p><p>For some reason the smile bothered Ukyo a little. Not that what Ranma said was untrue. Ukyo had long known Ranma liked when she dressed like a man. It was part of the reason she did so more often than not. Ukyo shrugged. 'It's nothing.' She thought. Ukyo smiled in slight embarrassment. "I do like to dress up a little more feminine once in a while."</p><p>"When was the last time that happened?" Akane said in an aside to Ukyo. "Got to admit no one pulls off being a guy quite like Ukyo." She said to Gigi. "You would not believe how many girls' hearts she broke when they found out the truth." Akane grinned at Ukyo's sputter of outrage.</p><p>Gigi laughed. "You two start your warmup." She said to Ranma and Akane. "Come with me Ukyo." She told the chef. Gigi led Ukyo to another part of the converted warehouse. Like the dance studio it was defined by a free standing wall. Ukyo was able to hear the music from where she was. This room had a large vanity against one wall. A large mirror spanned the width of the vanity. A string of lights framed the mirror. Against the adjacent wall were men's suits. Almost a dozen. "We made these for you."</p><p>Ukyo walked over to the suits. Her hand passed over the rack and then stopped. She took out the suit. It was white. White silk pants. White silk jacket. "All that's missing is white shoes and a cane." Ukyo said. "Where did you get these suits? Pimps-R-Us?"</p><p>Gigi laughed. "Actually, my boyfriend's closet." Gigi walked over to Ukyo and took the white suit from her. "Well I copied the design from his clothes. I made a few changes." She held the suit against Ukyo. Gigi nodded. "Take off your clothes." She told Ukyo.</p><p>"Excuse me?" Ukyo's eyebrows rose in surprise.</p><p>"I need you to try on the disguise." Gigi replied. "So I can see what adjustments I have to make." She reached into a box. "Put these on first." She tossed an item to Ukyo.</p><p>Ukyo grabbed it in midair. "Boxers?" She asked. Ukyo looked at the pair of boxers and blushed. Someone had sewn in some padding in the front. 'I'm going to look like I have a perpetual hard on.' She thought to herself. Her lips twisted slightly as she took off her clothes.</p><p>"You bind your breasts?" Gigi asked. "I just thought you were flat-chested." Gigi shrugged. "Well that solves one problem at least." She looked at Ukyo. "Well put them on." She ordered.</p><p>Ukyo put on the padded boxers. She looked down. "Oh lord." She quickly put on the white pants. Then a padded undershirt that Gigi gave her. Then a white shirt, socks, shoes and finally the jacket.</p><p>"Damn you make a great looking guy." Gigi said. "Just a little makeup to square your jaw and you're done."</p><p>Ukyo nodded. "That's usually all I needed." She said in agreement. She gave Gigi a wry smile. "Sometimes not even that." Ukyo removed the bow from her hair and brushed out her hair until it fell across her shoulders. She walked over to the vanity and quickly applied some makeup. Ukyo looked in the mirror. She laughed. "One pimp coming up." She said.</p><p>"That's the idea." Gigi agreed. She grinned. "I think you mentioned a cane?" She walked over to the clothes rack. "Here." She said and tossed her a white, silver headed cane. "A bit over the top but in your case it works." She said.</p><p>Ukyo grabbed the cane and stood. She spun the cane in her hands a few times. "Well it's not my spatula but it'll do." She looked at Gigi. "Okay this is fun and all but why?"</p><p>"Come with me." Gigi said. She walked out of the dressing room. Ukyo followed. Gigi led Ukyo back to the dance studio.</p><p>"Hey guys." Ukyo called as they reentered the dance studio. "How do I, oh gods Ran-chan what the hell are you doing?" Ukyo hadn't really noticed the pole on the stage when she first walked in to the studio. Now she did since Ranma was dancing on the stage and was holding on to the pole. Assuming what Ranma was doing was indeed dancing. Ukyo felt her face flush, not in embarrassment but desire. Ranma was dancing sensually around the pole and for some reason was naked from the waist up. Not that what remained of her clothes covered all that much. Akane sat near the stage watching intently. Ukyo could see that Akane was not wearing a lot more than Ranma.</p><p>Ranma stopped dancing. "Hey Uk-chan." Ranma called. "Wow, you look great." Ranma looked at Akane. "What do you think Tomboy?"</p><p>Akane walked over to Ukyo then walked slowly around her. Finally she nodded. "Got to admit you make a great looking guy." She said grudgingly.</p><p>"What's going on?" Ukyo demanded. "Why are the two of you dressed like that?" She looked at Ranma. "Why aren't you dressed period?" She amended. "Gods Ran-chan it looked like you were doing a strip tease."</p><p>"That's because she was." Akane said with a slightly sour grin. "It wouldn't be so bad if she wasn't better at it than me." Akane shrugged. "This is our cover." She explained.</p><p>"And you went along with it?" Ukyo said in disbelief. "You?"</p><p>"Yeah, me." Akane replied. She looked at Ranma. "It's what Ranma wanted." Akane gave Ukyo a sheepish grin. "Actually it isn't so bad once you get used to it."</p><p>"Yeah, wait until you see the Tomboy dance." Ranma added. She fanned herself. "Hot." Akane blushed.</p><p>"Okay let me get this straight." She said. "The two of you are going to be strippers." She said with a touch of disbelief. "What does that make me? Your pimp?" Ukyo looked at Ranma's smiling face. "Oh gods that's exactly what I'm supposed to be." She said in sudden realization. "Ran-chan!"</p><p>"You gotta admit no one will ever figure it out." Ranma replied. "It's perfect." Ranma grinned. "We even got stage names." She jabbed her bare chest with a thumb. "I'm Usagi." Ranma pointed to Akane. "Akane is Aoi."</p><p>"And me?" Ukyo asked in a resigned tone of voice. "Have you picked out a name for me?" Ukyo turned to look in the mirror. "I look like I should be called 'Big Daddy' or something."</p><p>"Perfect." Ranma said with a laugh.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kimi looked up from her magazine as Nabiki let out a sigh of frustration. "What's the matter Nabs?" She asked.<p>"It's not going to work." Nabiki grumbled.</p><p>"What's not going to work?" Kimi asked.</p><p>"Noriudo's plan." Nabiki replied sourly. "I take that back, it'll work but it will take too long." Nabiki leaned back in her chair and pinched the bridge of her nose. "Sure we could develop a network of informers and the like," Nabiki shrugged. "Its part of how I did things in High School, but it's so damn slow."</p><p>Kimi walked over to Nabiki and stood behind her and started to massage her shoulders. "Damn you're tense." She commented. "You know you can't think clearly when you're this tense." She leaned forward. "You want Auntie Kimi to help you relax." She purred into Nabiki's ear. Suddenly she chuckled. "Actually I have a better idea."</p><p>Nabiki turned in her chair. "Something better?" She raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"We still haven't gone on our date." Kimi replied with a grin. "What you need Nabs old girl is to get laid." Her grin widened as Nabiki started to turn pink. "Nothing like it to relax the body."</p><p>"Says you." Nabiki replied. "And how, she asked, am I supposed to do that?" She looked at Kimi. "I can't just walk up to a guy and ask him."</p><p>"Why not?" Kimi replied with a grin. "Nabs, I'm a woman and I wouldn't say no to you." Kimi laughed at Nabiki's blush. "Girlfriend, getting laid is going to be the least of your worries; you can afford to be choosy." Kimi pulled Nabiki out of her chair. "We are going out tonight." She said decisively. "And find our 'date'."</p><p>"Choosy huh?' Nabiki said . "I like the sound of that." She smiled. "I like the way you think girlfriend."</p><p>"Thought you might." Kimi replied. She gave Nabiki a little push. "Get your purse, we need to go shopping."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki and Kimi walked through the Tokyo Mall. They wore sunglasses and a wide brimmed hat to cover their faces. "I don't mind the sunglasses," Muttered Nabiki. "But the hat," She rolled her eyes. "That's it." Nabiki said. "The hat's got to go."<p>"Nabs?" Kimi said in confusion.</p><p>"I hate this hat." Nabiki said. "I hate hats period." Nabiki walked over to a mall directory and started reading. Her finger suddenly jabbed out. "There." She said. She took Kimi's hand. "Let's go." Nabiki marched off with Kimi in tow.</p><p>"Where are we going Nabs?" Kimi said. She matched her stride to Nabiki's but continued to hold hands.</p><p>"It's a surprise." Nabiki grinned. They walked along for a while. Try as she might Kimi couldn't get anything out of Nabiki. Suddenly Nabiki stopped. "Here we are."</p><p>Kimi looked at the store. She shook her head. "I might have known." She said in admiration. "I wonder if I'd look good as a redhead." She said teasingly.</p><p>Nabiki flushed slightly. Then smiled evilly. "Let's find out." They entered the store. A young woman in her mid twenties approached them.</p><p>"Welcome to Nana's Natural Hair Wigs." She said with a bow. "How may I help you?"</p><p>Nabiki took off her hat. "What would you suggest?" She asked the saleswoman. "I want to look...different."</p><p>The young woman looked at Nabiki for a moment. "Blond." The woman said decisively. "And long, with bangs." She nodded. She raised a finger. "Let me show you." She said. "You'll be surprised by how much it will change your appearance." She walked quickly away.</p><p>Nabiki smiled. "That's the idea." She said quietly. She turned to Kimi. "What do you think?"</p><p>"I want to see the effect before I say anything." Kimi replied. "But," She nodded. "I like it." She tilted her head. "A good wig isn't going to be cheap." She said. "Can we afford it?"</p><p>Nabiki shrugged. "We'll be eating ramen for a week, but yeah." Nabiki looked up as the saleswoman reappeared. She was carrying a box.</p><p>"Now this," The saleswoman said. "Is the 'Starlet'." She opened the box and reached in. It seemed like she was pulling the wig out forever, the wig was so long. She held the wig in one hand. She reached into her pocket with her other hand and pulled out a packet. She handed the packet to Nabiki. "Put this on."</p><p>Nabiki took the packet and nodded. She opened the package and put on the contents. A hair net. "Make sure it's tight." The saleswoman said to Nabiki. Nabiki nodded. She turned. "How's this?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>The saleswoman looked at Nabiki. "It'll do for now but if you really want the effect to be more natural, you'll cut your hair shorter." She nodded to Kimi. "Like your friend there."</p><p>Nabiki looked at Kimi. Since prison, Kimi had let her hair grow but not too much. The hair being kept to no more than an inch or so. She pursed her lips. "You have any wigs that look like my hair now?" She asked. The woman nodded. Nabiki nodded back. "Let's see how I look as a blond." She said. The saleswoman helped Nabiki put on the wig. Nabiki kept her back to a mirror. When the woman indicated her, grudging, satisfaction, Nabiki closed her eyes and turned around. Nabiki opened her eyes. "Oh. My." Her hand reached up and brushed at her newly acquired bangs.</p><p>"Not bad Nabs." Kimi said after a moment. "I barely recognize you."</p><p>"Good." Nabiki said in satisfaction. "How much for two?" She asked the saleswoman. "The other for my friend here."</p><p>"You're in luck." The woman replied. "Normally this model goes for twenty thousand yen but I can give you two for thirty-five."</p><p>Nabiki grinned.</p><p>An hour later two blonds walked out of the wig store. "I can't believe you got them to throw in the fourth one for free." Kimi said in admiration. "You know girlfriend, hooking up with you has turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me."</p><p>"Same here Kimi." Nabiki replied seriously. Then she smiled. "Now. What should we get for our date tonight?"</p><p>Kimi grinned.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Daisuke watched the cab roll up in front of the club. He and his buddy Hiroshi had gotten jobs as doormen/security at the club. Hiroshi was leaning against the side of the building. "Hey Hiroshi." He hissed. "Take a look at what just got out of the cab."<p>"Whoa." He whistled in admiration. "Now that's something you don't see every day." Daisuke said.</p><p>"Two." Replied Hiroshi in agreement. "Count them, two hotties." He smiled brightly as the two blonds approached. "Come right in ladies." He said. "ID first." He shrugged. "Rules you know."</p><p>"No problem." The shorter of the two blonds replied. She opened the small clutch purse she carried and pulled out a card. "I'm Mari." She said in honeyed tones.</p><p>The second, taller blond showed Hiroshi her card. "I'm Su." She said. She leaned close to Hiroshi. "What's the cover baby?"</p><p>"A smile would be nice." Hiroshi said in hopeful tones.</p><p>"I think I can do better than that." 'Su' replied. She leaned even closer and pressed her chest against Hiroshi. "Pucker up handsome." She said.</p><p>"You heard my friend." 'Mari' said huskily to Daisuke.</p><p>'I've died and gone to heaven.' Hiroshi and Daisuke both thought as the blonds kissed both of them. "C-can I get your phone number?' Hitoshi stammered.</p><p>"I don't think you can afford us handsome." 'Su' replied. She patted Hiroshi on the cheek and she and 'Mari' entered the club. "Table or Bar?" Kimi said musingly. "Bar." She said decisively. "We're being available." She turned to Nabiki. "Let's go."</p><p>Kimi and Nabiki headed for the bar. The bar was busy but not crowded even at ten in the evening and they were able to get, if not seats, some room at the bar. A few minutes later Nabiki and Kimi had drinks in hand and were examining the crowd. "Not much to pick from." Nabiki muttered to Kimi after a few minutes of looking around.</p><p>"We only just got here." Kimi replied in amusement. "Let's give it an hour before we head to some place else." She elbowed Nabiki in the side. "Anxious to lose your virginity girlfriend?" She asked teasingly. "What's left of it anyway?"</p><p>"Toys don't count." Nabiki shot back. "Isn't that what you keep telling me?" Nabiki sighed. "This is so weird." She said. "I always thought it would be with someone I cared for, at least." She waved her hands in the air. "I never thought I'd be in a bar trolling for men."</p><p>"Well it could be worse." Kimi said mildly. "You have a choice at least." Kimi sighed.</p><p>"Bad memory girlfriend?' Nabiki asked in concern.</p><p>"Old news." Kimi waved a dismissive hand. She smiled at Nabiki. "But I'm getting some really good new memories to replace it." Kimi placed a hand on Nabiki's shoulder. "Some really good new memories."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Me too girlfriend, me too." Nabiki stepped a little closer to Kimi so that their shoulders almost touched. "Speaking of new memories." Nabiki whispered. "Where is Mr. Right when you need him?"</p><p>"Don't you mean, Mr. Right-now?" Kimi laughed. "Let's make sure he's worth it. He's going to get for free what a lot of guys would be willing to pay big bucks for."</p><p>"How big?" Asked Nabiki. "Don't look at me like that." She said. "I'm serious." Nabiki started tapping her finger against her lower lip. "Hmm."</p><p>Kimi looked around. Kimi smiled as she realized that she and Nabiki were becoming the center of several male's attentions. "Things are looking up."</p><p>Nabiki smiled at the men surrounding them. One stepped forward and asked Nabiki to dance. Nabiki tilted her head appraisingly then linked her arm with the man. A second man asked Kimi to dance.</p><p>Nabiki and Kimi were relaxing at the bar again after having danced several times. The surrounding admirers had thinned slightly. None of the men that were there really interested either one of the two women but they were having a good time. Suddenly Nabiki stood a little straighter. "Hello."</p><p>Kimi looked toward where Nabiki was staring. "What do you see?" She asked with a touch of excitement.</p><p>'Bachelor number 3." Nabiki replied with an anticipatory smile. "Well. Well. Tatewaki Kuno." She turned to Kimi. "What did you call him? Oh yeah, the perfect man."</p><p>Kimi's finally spotted Tatewaki. "I thought you said you didn't like him." She said in an aside.</p><p>"Don't." Nabiki replied. "Doesn't mean I don't think he's good looking." Her smile widened when she noticed Tatewaki veer in their direction. "I want to get laid, not fall in love." She said with a laugh. "Kuno will be good for a couple drinks at least."</p><p>"Careful Mari." Kimi said practicing the use of their cover names. "He could recognize you."</p><p>"I doubt he'll look up as far as our faces Su." Nabiki laughed. "I think tight black jeans and a black tube top will be distracting enough." Kimi snorted in amused agreement. "And if he does, now is the time to find out." Nabiki smiled. "Here he comes."</p><p>"Excuse me ladies." Tatewaki Kuno said in a curiously unsure voice. He leaned closer. "May I buy one of you a drink?"</p><p>"You can buy both of us drinks handsome." Kimi said. There was a sudden glint in her eye. 'Oh my, he's even better looking in real life.' She leaned closer to Tatewaki. "I'm Su. That's Mari." She said. "And you are?"</p><p>"Tat," Began Kuno then he broke off. "I mean, Ranma. Ranma Saotome." He looked over in concern as Nabiki started coughing. "Are you alright?"</p><p>Nabiki gasped and waved a hand in front of her mouth. "Drink went down wrong." She gasped. 'Now why in hell isn't he using his real name?' Nabiki thought. Nabiki swallowed to clear her throat. "Ranma?" She said in a more controlled voice. "What an interesting name." Nabiki leaned a little closer to Tatewaki. "So unusual." She gave Kuno a predatory smile. "And are you a 'wild horse'?"</p><p>Kuno flushed slightly. "Tis just a name." He replied nervously. Then Kuno's innate confidence reasserted itself. "Mayhaps you'd wish to find out for yourself?"</p><p>'Kuno? Flirting? Now, this is interesting.' Nabiki gave Tatewaki an appraising look. "Well you're good looking at least." She said. "I don't know." She said musingly. Nabiki turned to Kimi and winked. "I would hate to be..." Nabiki paused. "Disappointed."</p><p>Kimi widened her eyes slightly in surprise. She raised an eyebrow in inquiry. 'Lead on girl friend.' She thought. "Mari has certain," Kimi smiled at Kuno. "Minimum requirements." She nodded toward some of the men nearby who were giving Tatewaki dagger looks. "They think they qualify. How about you?"</p><p>Tatewaki snorted in amusement. "There are none who match my inestimable self." He said arrogantly.</p><p>"Confident aren't you handsome?" Kimi said. "I like that in a man." She linked her arm through one of Tatewaki's arms. Nabiki claimed the other. "Which of us do you think is prettier?" Kimi asked in a husky voice. 'Mister this is your lucky night.' She thought. 'Just don't say anything too stupid.'</p><p>"You both are fair and lovely." Tatewaki replied. "And I find I would be loath to choose one and crush the hopes of the other." Tatewaki smiled apologetically. "I believe I know how Paris felt." He sighed.</p><p>'Now that's an opening if I ever heard one.' Nabiki thought in amusement. "A golden apple wouldn't do us much good." Nabiki replied. "A goddess may enjoy such a trophy but a working girl needs something more," Nabiki looked down slightly. "Substantial."</p><p>Tatewaki raised an eyebrow. "You are familiar with the classics?" He asked in surprise.</p><p>Nabiki smiled. "Of course. Especially Shakespear." She replied. "I always thought the Merchant of Venice to be among his greatest works."</p><p>Tatewaki snorted. "That's who you remind me of." Tatewaki said suddenly. "She would have agreed with your choice."</p><p>"She?" Kimi asked. "Old girlfriend?" She smiled teasingly at Nabiki.</p><p>"Alas no." Tatewaki replied.</p><p>Nabiki's eyes widened in surprise. 'Alas'?' She thought.</p><p>Tatewaki looked embarrassed. "I fear she thought me somewhat of a fool." Tatewaki shrugged. "And I needs admit she was right." Tatewaki shook himself as if casting off a memory. "But what is past is past." He declared. He leaned toward Nabiki slightly. "You call yourself a working girl. I gather you mean something other than being an office lady."</p><p>"Something other." Agreed Nabiki. 'Gods I think I'm about to be propositioned.' She thought. 'By Kuno. Oh this is too good an opportunity to pass up.'</p><p>"And that something would be?" Kuno licked dry lips.</p><p>"I supply a service." Nabiki replied easily. "But unlike some others, I am very choosy about who I am willing to spend time with." She smiled. "And unlike some others, I don't work alone." She nodded her head at Kimi. "Su and I work together." She said. 'Now if 'Mr. Undecided' doesn't find that irresistible.' Nabiki suppressed a snort. She looked at Kimi. Kimi nodded slightly.</p><p>"Indeed?" Kuno looked a little nervous. "Forgive me if I offend, but I am new to this." Tatewaki blushed.</p><p>"Relax Handsome." Kimi said soothingly. "The only way you can offend us is by being cheap." She leaned against Tatewaki. "You don't look like the cheap kind." Her hand stopped Tatewaki from reaching for his wallet. "Not here handsome." She said. "Why don't you call us a cab and we can go somewhere more conducive to business."</p><p>Tatewaki pulled out a cell phone and quickly dialed a number. "Our conveyance should be here shortly." Tatewaki said. Several minutes later the three of them were in a cab. Nabiki gave her address and they settled back.</p><p>"It's a short ride." Nabiki said. She placed a finger on Tatewaki's lips. "We can discuss the details when we get there." Nabiki sat back. 'Well what do you know? I'm about to lose my virginity to Kuno of all people.' Nabiki shivered in anticipation. 'And for money.' Nabiki smiled enticingly at Tatewaki. 'Little does little Tatewaki realize I would do it with him for free but there is no way I'm going to pass up making a little money.' Nabiki leaned her head on Tatewaki's shoulder. 'I think the idea of doing it for money is turning me on.'</p><p>The cab stopped in front of Nabiki and Kimi's apartment. "Come on in Lover." Nabiki said. "Make yourself at home." She and Kimi led Tatewaki into the apartment. "Drink?" Nabiki asked Tatewaki.</p><p>Kuno licked his lips nervously. "No thank you." He replied. He looked around. "Your place is not what I expected." He said. "It seems so," He waved his hands slightly. "Ordinary."</p><p>"What did you expect?" Kimi asked. "Whips and chains hanging on the wall?" She sat down next to Tatewaki. "Now." She said. "What can we do for you?" She smiled as Tatewaki started to stammer. "Relax lover." She tilted her head. "You're acting like this is your first time."</p><p>"No!" Tatewaki exclaimed. "I've done it before, it's just." Tatewaki sighed. "You probably will think this strange but when I saw the two of you." Tatewaki flushed. "There were these two girls in high school."</p><p>"Two women is a very common fantasy." Nabiki said soothingly. "Something we specialize in." Nabiki leaned a little closer. "What were their names?"</p><p>Kuno sighed again. "One was named Akane. Hair as black as a raven's wing." Tatewaki said sheepishly. "The other," Kuno shrugged. "I just called her the pig tailed girl. She had red hair like the setting sun." Kuno laughed slightly. "It's not that the two of you look anything like either of them but,"</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow at the last comment. 'Can't go by Tatewaki, he's clueless.' She reminded herself. 'Still it's good to know the wig works.' She smiled. "Wait here lover." She said to Tatewaki. "Su will keep you occupied until I return." Nabiki stood and swayed toward the bedroom. When she returned she found Kimi had gotten Tatewaki out of most of his clothes and was giving him a massage on the couch. "Couldn't wait for me, huh?" Nabiki said in amusement. "Well? How do I look?"</p><p>Tatewaki turned his head. "Pig tailed girl." He gasped. Nabiki had donned the red wig she had purchased and had managed to braid it into a short pig tail. She had removed her street clothes and had replaced them with something resembling harem pants and a thin robe. It was obvious Nabiki wore nothing underneath. "Oh my love you have come to me." Kuno crooned excitedly.</p><p>"Well I guess that makes me Akane." Kimi cracked. "Come with us Ranma." Kimi said.</p><p>"Tatewaki." Kuno said suddenly. "Call me Tatewaki."</p><p>"Money first." Nabiki said. "And don't be cheap." She admonished. "Tatewaki."</p><p>"Yes. Yes. Of course." Tatewaki said hurriedly. He reached for his pants and pulled out his wallet. "What?" Tatewaki swallowed nervously. "What would be appropriate?"</p><p>"What's your fantasy worth to you stud?" Kimi asked. "I'll give you a hint, our rent is due."</p><p>"Fantasy." Murmured Tatewaki. "Oh if you were only them." He opened his wallet and pulled out a large wad of bills. "If only." He said quietly. He placed the bills on the table.</p><p>"We'll be whoever you want us to be." Nabiki said in a curiously gentle voice. "Come along Tatewaki. Your loves await you." She extended a hand and Tatewaki took it. Nabiki pulled Tatewaki to his feet. She took Tatewaki's hand and led him into the bedroom.</p><p>Kimi followed slowly behind. 'Don't like him my ass.' Kimi thought in amusement. 'I think Tatewaki is not the only person living out their fantasy tonight.' Kimi smiled. 'I think I'm happy for both of them.' Kimi's smile changed to an almost evil grin. 'Ooh this is going to be a fun evening.' Kimi walked into the bedroom. Nabiki and Tatewaki were already entwined in each other's arms.</p><p>Kimi walked over to the dresser. The box with the wigs was sitting open on top of the dresser. She reached into the box and pulled out the brunette wig and put it on. Kimi removed her clothes and walked over to the bed. "Oh Tatewaki." She lilted.</p><p>Kuno looked up from the bed. "Akane." He breathed. Kimi got into the bed on Tatewaki's other side.</p><p>"That's right Tatewaki." Nabiki said. "Akane and the pig tailed girl are here. Just as you always wanted." She said. "Just as we always wanted."</p><p>The following afternoon a smiling Nabiki was sitting at her desk. Try as she might she couldn't keep her face from breaking into a satisfied grin every few minutes. 'Who'd have thought Kuno was such a good lover?' She thought. "Gods I think I'm horny again." She said aloud.</p><p>Kimi laughed. "He was good wasn't he?" She walked over to Nabiki. "And very generous as well." She pulled out a wad of bills from her pocket. "Thanks to Tatewaki we don't have to worry about eating Ramen." She handed the money to Nabiki. "All we need is one or two customers like Tatewaki and we'll never have to worry about money." Kimi said with a laugh.</p><p>"That's it!" Exclaimed Nabiki. "I figured out how to speed up our investigations." Nabiki stood and started pacing. "Escorts; from now on we are high priced escorts." Nabiki nodded to herself. "Anyone who could afford us is either rich like Kuno..."</p><p>"Or drug dealers." Kimi finished. "That may be true girlfriend, but either way escorts are going to have sex with their clients. Are you sure you want to do that? Can you do that?"</p><p>Nabiki grimaced. "I don't know." She admitted. "But if it means we find out who's supplying the drugs," Nabiki shrugged. "I think it's worth a try."</p><p>Kimi gave Nabiki a searching look. "Okay girlfriend." She said finally. "I'll follow your lead. Just don't be afraid to back out if it gets too hot, okay?" Nabiki nodded. "Good." Kimi continued. "In the meantime, I think I found the perfect investment."</p><p>Nabiki sat up straighter. "Oh?"</p><p>Kimi nodded. "Noburo's Pachinko Parlor." She tossed a binder to Nabiki. "He's looking for a partner."</p><p>Nabiki quickly scanned through the documents. A slow smile came to her face. "Looks good." She said. "Looks real good."</p><p>End Training Days</p><p>The circle is complete.</p><p>Author's Notes: I'm working on Book 2 of Queen Rat. It's still in progress so don't expect a release any time soon. But...it's coming along.</p>
