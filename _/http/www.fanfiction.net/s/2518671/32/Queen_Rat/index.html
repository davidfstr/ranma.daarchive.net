</div><p>Chapter 6</p><p>'Business partners'</p><p>Kodachi bowed carefully as each one of Nabiki's 'business associates' were ushered into the library of the Kuno mansion. By the way Nabiki greeted three of them, Tokio Wasamura, Kyoshi Narumi and Ky Young Ji, it was obvious these were the more important attendees. The others seemed almost surprised to have been invited. "What is your wish Lady Tendo?" Kodachi asked as the last guest had been brought in.</p><p>"Please remain Kodachi." Nabiki said "See to everyone's needs."</p><p>"Yes Lady Tendo." Kodachi replied. She walked over to Kyoshi Narumi first though she did glance at Nabiki as she did so. Nabiki nodded in approval. Kodachi had been briefed on each man's preferences and, like the trained hostess she was, efficiently made sure each man was properly supplied. Kyoshi Narumi was, to Kodachi's surprise, more refined than expected, unfortunately Tokio Wasamura was less so. Still it was apparent the presence of her brother effectively deterred anything more than some unwelcome looks from the man. The person that surprised her the most was the Korean. He seemed to go out of his way to be painfully polite and for some reason kept his left hand hidden.</p><p>Kodachi's eyebrow lifted as she listened to the conversation. 'If business meetings ran half as efficiently this country would be wealthy beyond our wildest dreams.' She thought in amazement. While both her Brother and Kimi contributed to the conversation, it was obvious that Nabiki Tendo ran the show.</p><p>"Ky." Nabiki almost barked. "What is the status of the drug trafficking operations in your district?"</p><p>'Drugs.' Kodachi thought in horror. Her horror changed to shock and amazement when the Korean made his report.</p><p>"I've been able to locate and," Ky Young Ji glanced at Kodachi for a moment and then seemed to choose his words. "close two Meth labs. If any remains in my area it's not being produced locally."</p><p>"Excellent Ky." Nabiki said in approval. She glanced at Kyoshi and Tokio. The two men nodded. "I'm impressed by how well you've turned your territory around."</p><p>"Thank you Ice Queen." Ky Young Ji murmured quietly.</p><p>"In fact, I'm so impressed I was wondering if you think you could handle some additional territory?" Nabiki smiled regally. "Good performance should be rewarded appropriately." She said. Her gaze swept the table and lingered on those Kodachi had pegged as the lesser members. "Remember that."</p><p>"You, you are eliminating drugs in your territory?" Kodachi gasped in disbelief. suddenly she paled. "Forgive me Lady Tendo, I spoke out of turn." She bowed her head nervously.</p><p>"Yes you did." Nabiki said coldly. "But I will let it go. This one time." She kept her eyes on Kodachi. "I will not allow drugs or guns into any area I control." her gaze again swept the table. "Anyone who cannot follow this rule." She shrugged. "Will be dealt with appropriately."</p><p>Kodachi noticed one of the member, Kentaro Noichi , if Kodachi remembered correctly, squirming slightly. 'One to watch. She's stopping drugs.' Kodachi looked at her brother. 'By the gods, they're actually trying to do something.' She caught her brother's eye and nodded slightly toward Kentaro.</p><p>Tatewaki kept his face impassive. "I think this is an appropriate time to call a small break." He said calmly.</p><p>"And a perfect time to go powder my nose." Kimi said with a touch of relief in her voice.</p><p>"Would you mind if I accompanied you Lady Kimi?" Kodachi asked 'My brother's timing is as excellent as ever, I just hope Kimi will listen to me.'</p><p>"We might as well all go." Nabiki rose. "Gentlemen, if you will excuse us?" She looked at Kodachi. "Ladies, shall we go?" Without a backward glance Nabiki walked out of the room, Kodachi hurried to catch up. Kimi strolled after.</p><p>"Lady Tendo." Kodachi said as soon as they exited the room. She stopped at Nabiki's raised hand. Nabiki kept on walking and Kodachi followed on her heels. Kimi caught up with Kodachi.</p><p>"Wait." Kimi said quietly. Kodachi looked at Kimi in surprise. They continued walking. Kodachi kept throwing glances at Kimi. Nabiki led them into the large and well appointed bathroom. Kimi sat down on a small lounge chair in front of a vanity while Nabiki leaned against the wall. "Okay Kodachi." Kimi said. "What did you see?" She rolled her eyes impatiently at Kodachi's hesitation. "Tatewaki called the break so we could talk, now talk."</p><p>"Forgive me, I think being wrong about you is a habit I need to break." Kodachi licked her lips to moisten them. "I think Mr Noichi will be trouble." She said hesitantly.</p><p>Nabiki folded her arms across her chest and lowered her head and thought. "I agree." She said after a minute's pause. "How much trouble is the question."</p><p>"He didn't like your announcement." Kodachi replied. "Lady Tendo, I," Kodachi hesitated. "I may have a problem with your announcement as well."</p><p>"Explain." Nabiki ordered.</p><p>"I am an herbalist, Lady Tendo." She stopped at Nabiki's raised hand.</p><p>"It's Nabiki." Nabiki said firmly. "In here you can call me Nabiki." She shrugged delicately. "I had forgotten." She turned to Kimi. "Kodachi is being a bit modest. She's an accomplished botanist and chemist. She's produced some interesting substances in the past. Sleeping gas, for one."</p><p>"I also produce some rare narcotics." Kodachi admitted. "Some of the source material," Kodachi looked down. "Opium for example." Silence greeted Kodachi's announcement. "But I do get it legally." Kodachi blurted. "I have a government research grant." She said hurriedly. "I have all the proper credentials."</p><p>Kimi whistled. "Now that I think of it, your file said you have a degree in both subjects." She gave Nabiki a sheepish grin. "I let my dislike of Kodachi get in the way."</p><p>"So did I." Nabiki replied. "I want you to take a close look at the woman you so easily dismissed Kodachi. What she and I earned together, we did as partners. If she had been born a Tendo, you might be calling her the Ice Queen instead of me." She leaned forward. "If she had been born a Kuno, she would own Japan by now." She smiled at Kimi. "Even starting out with all her disadvantages, she was doing very well indeed."</p><p>"The girl does love to exagerate." Kimi grinned. "I'd tell her to stop but I kind of like it." Kimi rubbed the bridge of her nose in unconscious imitation of Nabiki. "I don't see a problem really. She's legit and so are we, mostly." Kimi pursed her lips. "I'll call Chikato anyway." She looked at Kodachi. "You might as well know, Chikato is Chikato Noriudo, Lieutenant Chikato Noriudo. He's a cop."</p><p>"Then you're not really Yakusa." Kodachi said in relief.</p><p>"What gave you that idea?" Nabiki said with a touch of ice in her voice. "Why we do what we do doesn't change what we are." She waved a negating hand. "No matter, back to Noichi." She gave Kodachi a tiny nod. "I'll make sure someone keeps an eye on him." Nabiki pushed off from the wall. "Well since we're here. If you'll excuse me."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi walked back to the library with Nabiki and Kimi her head bowed in thought. She stopped at the door and let Nabiki and Kimi enter first and followed. Kodachi took up her place near the bar. She watched as Nabiki and Kimi walk over to stand next to Tatewaki. Nabiki leaned closer and whispered something in Tatewaki's ear. A slight smile came to the kendoist's face.<p>"Excuse me Ms Kuno." A man's voice interrupted Kodachi's thoughts. She turned. "Oh Mr. Ky Young Ji, can I help you?"</p><p>"Yeah, you have any aspirin?" Ky Young Ji replied.</p><p>Kodachi noticed that the Korean was rubbing his left hand. Now that it was exposed she could see that a bandage covered the little finger. Her eyes widened in sudden understanding. "I don't think an aspirin would be sufficient." She said quietly. "Please wait one moment." Kodachi walked over to Kimi and whispered something. Kimi glanced over to Ky and nodded. Kodachi walked back over to the Korean. "If you will come with me." Kodachi said. She took Ky Young Ji's arm and led him to the door. There was a snicker from one of the gang leaders and she heard someone make what was obviously an obscene comment. Kodachi paled.</p><p>"Ignore Noichi." Ky Young Ji said. "He's an idiot."</p><p>"He's more than that. He's dangerous." Kodachi half snarled. "Forgive me. I speak out of turn." She added hurriedly.</p><p>"Maybe, but I happen to agree with you." Ky Young Ji said seriously. He rubbed his hand again. "damn that hurts."</p><p>"Why?" Kodachi asked quietly. "I know why it hurts, why did you do it?"</p><p>Ky Young Ji looked at Kodachi. "I," Ky Young Ji paused. "I failed." He said after a moment. "The Ice Queen was kind enough to accept my apology."</p><p>"She seemed quite impressed with you." Kodachi countered. "Her reward was unnecessarily public."</p><p>Ky Young Ji smiled self-consciously. "Considering where I started from it really wasn't difficult to improve."</p><p>"I think you're being too hard on yourself." Kodachi led the gangster into a small room. It was obvious the room belonged to someone with a great interest in natural science. Reference books, illustrations and a white board covered in chemical formula reinforced the impression. "Please sit." Kodachi indicated a chair. Kodachi walked over to a cabinet and opened some drawers. She returned with a tray that contained a number of items. "Let me see your hand."</p><p>"Are you a doctor?" Ky Young Ji extended his hand.</p><p>"An herbalist, actually." Kodachi replied. She quickly cut off the bandage. "But my research has forced me to learn at least some rudiments of practical medicine." Kodachi tsked. "Whoever did the sutures should have his license revoked." She muttered. "Nothing I can do about that." Kodachi picked up a bottle and sprayed the wound.</p><p>"Hey, it stopped hurting." Ky Young Ji exclaimed in relief.</p><p>"It's only temporary." Kodachi said. "It will wear off in a couple days. Hopefully by then you will have healed enough that an aspirin will be sufficient." Kodachi rebandaged the wound.</p><p>"Thank you." Ky Young Ji said gratefully.</p><p>"May I ask you another question?" Kodachi asked hesitantly. Ky Young Ji nodded. "Oh, how do I ask this? The drug labs." Kodachi trailed off. "Was, was anyone hurt?"</p><p>"The Ice Queen frowns on unnecessary violence." Ky Young Ji replied gravely. "There was nothing unnecessary." The Korean spread his hands in apology. "Those two labs were well guarded and well defended." Ky Young Ji looked at his bandaged hand. "Until I met the Ice Queen, I would have probably been running those labs. Money, that's what I wanted and the power it brings. I"m Korean Miss Kuno. I've been reminded of that as far back as I remember. I never belonged." He smled slightly. "None of the old families would have had a Korean as a member."</p><p>Kodachi stood. "We should go back." She said quietly. Ky Young Ji nodded and stood as well. To Ky Young Ji's surprise Kodachi linked her arm through  walked quietly back to the library. Kodachi stopped and turned to the Korean. "Thank you for being so honest with me." Kodachi said in sincere tones. Kodachi released Ky Young Ji's arm and opened the door. She recaptured his arm as they entered. Kodachi escorted Ky Young Ji back to the table.</p><p>"Thank you again." Ky Young Ji. He looked at Tatewaki. "Your sister is most capable." He said carefully, fully aware of his words. "And most gracious." He told the kendoist.</p><p>"My sister has many good qualities but I find those two especially gratifying to hear about." Tatewaki replied. He gave Kodachi a nod. "Please sit."</p><p>"Awful long time to get a bandaid." Came a nasal voice from near the end of the table. He looked at Kodachi. "But I can see why." He turned back to Ky Young Ji and his face was suffused with anger. "Keep your hands off her Korean."</p><p>"How dare you." Snarled Kodachi.</p><p>"Sister." Tatewaki said warningly.</p><p>"No. Let her speak." Nabiki interrupted. "You find Noichi's comment offensive Ms. Kuno?" She asked Kodachi.</p><p>"I do." Kodachi advanced on Noichi. "No one speaks for Kodachi Kuno, especially not some bigoted slime like you." She drew herself up. "Who do you think you are little man? Who do you think you are speaking to?" She intercepted the attempted slap from the gangster with a negligent swipe. "You even dare attempt to lay hands upon me." She hissed. She turned away and strode to stand in front of Nabiki. "Lady Tendo, I can and will countenance much but I will not be silent. Not for this, this garbage." She pointed to Noichi. "I demand an apology for both myself and Ky Young Ji."</p><p>"That's not necessary." Began Ky Young Ji.</p><p>"I think it is." Nabiki said quietly. "By insulting you Ky, Noichi has insulted me." She looked at Kentaro Noichi coldly. "Apologize." She said in her iciest tones.</p><p>"Or what?" Kentaro Noichi sneered. "Who do you think you're fooling? No drugs. No guns. Acting like you're something special. You're crooks, Just like me."</p><p>"No not like you." Ky Young Ji said in tones that nearly matched Nabiki's. He placed his bandaged hand on the table. "We. Are. Not. Thugs." He snapped out. The other gang leaders found their eyes irrisistably drawn to Ky's damaged hand. Then just as irrisistably their heads turned toward Nabiki.</p><p>"Big deal." Noichi said derisively. "So you cut your finger. Am I supposed to be impressed?"</p><p>"If you're not, then you're a fool." Tokio Wasuhara said quietly. "There is no room for fools here."</p><p>Kodachi's eyes widened at Tokio's words. 'He may be crude but he is no fool.' She thought. She looked at Nabiki. A small smile was playing on the Ice Queen's face. 'No, she wouldn't associate with a fool, would she.' She realized.</p><p>"I am waiting for that apology." Nabiki said calmly.</p><p>"You can wait forever." Noichi replied with a derisive laugh.</p><p>"I see." Nabiki turned to Tatewaki and made a small gesture. He nodded.</p><p>"Sasuke." Tatewaki barked. The diminutive Ninja appeared from seemingly nowhere. "Please escort Mr. Noichi to his car." He said. "I fear it was a mistake inviting him here tonight."</p><p>"At once Master." Sasuke replied. Before Noichi could blink he was whisked out of the Library. They could hear his angry shouts fade away.</p><p>"Is there anyone else who should not be here as well?" Nabiki said coldly. "I will not have my choice of associates questioned. Especially not one who's truly earned his place here." She looked at the Korean and noticed that his bandaged hand remained visible. She gave him an approving nod. Nabiki turned to Kodachi. "For future reference you do not demand anything." She said coolly."You request."</p><p>"Yes Lady Tendo." Kodachi said.</p><p>Nabiki smiled and the smile was almost warm. "However I've always had a soft spot for strong women." She said. "So I will let it go. This one time."</p><p>"Thank you Lady Tendo." Kodachi replied.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"I not know why I have to work with skinny bitch." Ting Li grumped.<p>"Because we said so." Akane said firmly. "And because you have the hots for Ryoga." She said. "I don't want that to get in the way."</p><p>Ting Li hung her head. "You right." She sighed. "Sorry."</p><p>"That's better." Akane nodded approvingly. "But you're still working with Kodachi."</p><p>"Yes Akane." Ting Li sighed again. There were two soft thumps. Ting Li turned around to find Kodachi and Konatsu. Kodachi was winding up what looked like a long ribbon. Ting Li appraised the gymnast. 'She may be a skinny bitch.' Ting Li thought to herself. 'But she moves like a warrior.'</p><p>Kodachi used the time spent winding up her ribbon to appraise the orange haired warrior. 'What is it with Amazons and their hair?' She thought. 'At least she's not as overendowed as Shampoo." She walked over and then bowed first to Akane, then Ting Li. "Good afternoon." She said to Ting Li. "I'm Kodachi Kuno."</p><p>Ting Li shook her clasped hands at Kodachi in Chinese fashion. "Ting Li." She said in self introduction. "Heya Konatsu." Konatsu was wearing an outfit that was very similar to Kodachi's.</p><p>"Hey Ting Li." Konatsu replied. He turned to Kodachi. "She's really nice Kodachi, so stop giving her dagger looks." Konatsu turned to Ting Li. "That goes for you too." The transvestite scolded. "I want you two to be friends."</p><p>The two women looked at each other. Ting Li blinked first. "I sorry, I let feelings get in way."</p><p>"Feelings?" Kodachi asked curiously. Kodachi's eyes widened. "You like that, that pig?"</p><p>"You seem to like until you learn secret." Ting Li shot back. "Oh Ryoga." Mimicked Ting Li. "You so big."</p><p>"You, you saw the video?" Kodachi asked hesitantly."Is there anyone in Nerima who hasn't seen the video?" She complained to Akane.</p><p>"Ting Li's just mad that she's probably never going to have him." Akane supplied. "She was griping the entire time." Akane elbowed Ting Li. "She kept on making a list of all the things Ryoga did to you that she wanted to try."</p><p>"You do know he turns into a pig." Kodachi asked.</p><p>"Oh yes." The Amazon replied. "Not interested in pig Ryoga, but man Ryoga." Ting Li sighed. "You not know how much I envy."</p><p>"Me too." Konatsu said cheerfully. "You are soooo lucky."</p><p>Kodachi's expression froze for a moment. Her glance flitted between Ting Li and Konatsu. Kodachi trembled. "Oh ho ho ho ho." She burst out laughing. It took a while but Kodachi finally stopped laughing. "Oh I needed that." She gasped.</p><p>"That's better." Konatsu said. "Now here's what we're going to do." Konatsu grinned. "We're going to go looking for Ryoga. You and Ting Li take him back to the mansion." He shrugged. "The hardest part will be me switching places with Kodachi."</p><p>Kodachi reached into the front of her leotard and pulled out a tube of lipstick. "Not if we use this." She said. "It combines a mild hallucinagen with a powerful aphrodesiac." Kodachi smiled nastily. "Once it takes effect, all you'll have to do is tell him you're me. You could tell him you're a goat for all that it would matter." She took out a small pill case. "Take this first. It will protect you from the effects for the next twenty four hours."</p><p>Konatsu swallowed a pill. "It's really that strong?" Konatsu asked as he applied the lipstick. He handed the tube to Ting Li.</p><p>"Put it this way Konatsu." Kodachi said. "Until it wears off, Ryoga will be willing to have sex with just about anyone or anything available."</p><p>"Really?" Cooed Konatsu. "How," He grinned. "Nice."</p><p>"Are there any side effects?' Akane asked. "I'm pissed at him, not homicidal."</p><p>"He'll have a really bad hangover the next morning but that's about it." Kodachi assured Akane. "Well there is one other side effect. The aphrodisiac will induce a state of priapism while raising his stimulation threshold making it difficult for him to achieve orgasm. If he doesn't ejaculate he will also have the worst case of sexual frustration ever. Blue balls I think they call it. Magnified by, oh say, a factor of ten." Kodachi smiled at Akane's snicker."I take it you approve."</p><p>"Oh yeah." Akane said gleefully. "That will do very nicely." Akane pulled out a cellphone and punched in a number. "It's me. Operation Pig Roast is a go." Akane giggled. "Tell Ukyo to make some extra popcorn." She waved the back of her hand at Kodachi, Konatsu and Ting Li. "Shoo. Go find the pig."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ryoga bounced cheerfully across the rooftops of Nerima enjoying the darkening sky. 'Man life is good. Money in bank, food in my belly and all the pussy I can eat.' Ryoga threw his head back and laughed joyfully. "I love being me." He screamed to the sky. Ryoga laughed as he bounced across the rooftops of Nerima. Enjoying the darkening sky.<p>As he ran he looked around so it was with some anticipation when he spied an orange-haired girl running several rooftops away. Her back was to him and apparently she hadn't seen him. "Speaking of pussy. I wonder if she's a natural orange? Let's see if I can find out." Ryoga changed direction to intercept Ting Li. He took his time but eventually their paths crossed, almost collided on a rooftop.</p><p>"Aiyah." Ting Li jumped sideways in surprise. She backflipped to the end of the roof and turned around. The expression on her face shifted rapidly from surprise, to recognition, to, Ryoga smiled, welcoming, before settling on slightly annoyed. "It Ryoga yes?" She said. "Why you not watch where you going?"</p><p>Ryoga grin got wider. "I was."</p><p>"Oh?" Ting Li's eyebrow rose in ironic inquiry.</p><p>"Good to see you Ting Li." Ryoga said. "I was just thinking about you."</p><p>"Sure you were." TIng Li said in slight sarcasm.</p><p>"Honest." Replied Ryoga. "I was thinking 'I wonder where Ting Li would like to go for dinner?'" He said. "Especially when I'm buying."</p><p>Ting Li walked over to Ryoga. She put her arms around his neck. "I know perfect place." She leaned into Ryoga and pressed her lips against his. The kiss seemed to fire Ryoga's blood. "Tell you what you buy dinner. I get dessert." Ting Li kissed Ryoga again.</p><p>"Oh ho ho ho." Came a voice. Kodachi swung on to the rooftop. "Ryoga my love, there you are." She skipped cheerfully over to Ryoga. "What's this? Another woman?" Kodachi knuckled her eye. "My love I am crushed." She straightened. "I will give you until the count of three to come over here and give me a kiss." She smiled. "One."</p><p>Ryoga seemed to get slightly dizzy. He had an overwhelming urge to run over and kiss Kodachi. At the same time he had just as overwhelming urge to rip Ting Li's clothes off and take her right there. "Two." Came Kodachi's voice. Ryoga turned and started to walk toward Kodachi. He took Ting Li with him, holding her easily in one arm. His lips puckered involuntarily as Kodachi leaned over and kissed him. Ryoga's dizzyness increased slightly. It felt almost like he had had a couple shots of  better. He wrapped his free arm around Kodachi's waist and lifted her off the ground. He held the two women easily.</p><p>"Take us to my place." Kodachi whispered into Ryoga's ears. "And there you will experience delights few men dare dream."</p><p>"Hold on." Ryoga said cheerfully. His smile widened as Kodachi and Ting Li pressed themselves against him. He leaped across the rooftops. His urgency to get the girls somewhere soon matched the urgency that was building in his loins. The urgency increased even further as each of the women started kissing him. The dizzyness didn't so much increase as Ryoga felt as if his thoughts were being wrapped in cotten. Ryoga reached the Kuno mansion in record time and without getting lost. Still carrying the two girls he ran up the stairs to the mansion, through the front door and was racing up the stairs. The door to Kodachi's bedroom had barely closed before Ryoga was trying to simultaneously remove Kodachi's, Ting Li's and his own clothes.</p><p>Ryoga found himself lying naked and face up on Kodachi's large bed. "Gottagottagotta." Muttered Ryoga over and over. The smells, scent and touches of the two women overwhelmed him. So entranced was Ryoga that he was barely aware that there now seemed to be only one pair of hands caressing him and one mouth kissing him. Yet no matter the touch, whether hand or mouth, he could not find release. Ryoga howled in frustration.</p><p>Ryoga grabbed the woman and rolled on top of  some reason the woman twisted so her back was to Ryoga. Ryoga pressed between the woman's thighs searching urgently for an entrance. "Where is it?' He slurred drunkenly. "I know there's a pussy around here somewhere." He said. "Butt feels nice." He squeezed the woman's ass. Then slapped it.</p><p>"Ooh Ryoga." Murmured the woman beneath him. "How did you know I like that?"</p><p>Ryoga blinked muzzily. "You sound different Kodachi."</p><p>"I thought we were just going to play with him and then tie him up." Ting Li whispered to Kodachi. They were sitting wide eyed at the foot of the bed watching Ryoga and Konatsu.</p><p>"Me too." Kodachi whispered back. Then she giggled. "But I have to admit feeling a bit of satisfaction in getting a little revenge this way."</p><p>"Think how Akane feel." Ting Li whispered back. "Remember no clouds and rain." She said suddenly.</p><p>"Don't worry even without the drug Ryoga takes his time. He could go through the three of us, twice, before he'd orgasm." She rolled her eyes. "Not that I plan on repeating my last experience. Once was enough thank you."</p><p>"How I feel about Ranma." Ting Li replied with a slight shiver.</p><p>"You had Ranma?" Kodachi asked in disbelief. "Where was Akane at the time?" Kodachi's eyes widened at Ting Li's grin. "You didn't?" She laughed. "Akane?"</p><p>"Collect whole set, had Ukyo too." Ting Li chuckled. "Once definitely enough." She looked at the two figures on the bed. "Oh he going to be so-so mad in morning." Her mouth twisted. "I going be only one not get Ryoga."</p><p>"You got Ranma, Akane AND Ukyo." Kodachi said reasonably. "I think that makes us even." She turned toward the bed again. "Konatsu, that's enough. It's only supposed to look like you're having sex." She pulled out a perfume bottle from her nightstand and sprayed the contents in Ryoga's face. Ryoga's eyes rolled up and he fell off Konatsu.</p><p>"Meanie." Konatsu grumped. "It was just getting good."</p><p>"No doubt." Kodachi said dryly. She looked at the ceiling. "I hope you are satisfied Akane."</p><p>There was a pause, then a click. "I'm satisfied." Came Akane's voice from a small speaker.</p><p>"Come along you two." Kodachi said. "We'll sleep in the guest suite tonight." She looked at the sighing Konatsu. "And Akane calls Ranma a slut." There was a click. "He is a slut." Came Akane's voice. "Good night guys and thank you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ryoga woke up with a blinding headache and a pain in his groin that, now that he was awake, made his eyes water. He groaned. "What hit me?" Ryoga staggered to his feet and looked around. He thought he recognized the room as belonging to Kodachi. He shook his head to clear it. Ryoga looked down. He screamed.<p>Kodachi looked up. "Ah Ryoga is awake."</p><p>"He doesn't sound happy." Akane said. "Good." She poured herself some tea. "More tea Kodachi?" Kodachi murmured a 'no thank you'. "Ranma? Uk-chan? Ting Li?" Ranma held out his cup. "You know Kodachi, the offer still stands, you can have the disk back."</p><p>Kodachi sipped her tea. "Thank you, but no. It gives me an incentive to behave." Kodachi smiled slightly. "I'm sure there will be times when it will be needed." Her smile widened as another howl echoed through the mansion. "Ah, I believe he's found out about the heightened sensitivity."</p><p>Ting Li whistled low. "Aiyah." She breathed. "Kodachi show me lab." She bowed her head respectfully to the gymnast. "I train with alchemist in village. She kill for lab like yours." Ting Li placed her hands together in front of her. "Please, show me how make potions." She begged. "Just one potion. Please."</p><p>"Well I don't know." Kodachi said slowly.</p><p>"Aw, show the girl something." Ranma said. "Be a sport."</p><p>Kodachi shook her head. "I must be crazy." She held up a hand. "Hold the comments." She said. "Sure, why not?" She smiled when Ting Li clapped her hands together in glee. She looked up at another howl. "Not that one though."</p><p>"Meanie.' Ting Li giggled. "By the way, where Konatsu?"</p><p>Ryoga whimpered. The headache was subsiding but the pain but the swelling in his groin, if anything, had gotten worse. Ryoga looked up miserably when the door to the bedroom opened. "What did you do to me Kodachi?" Ryoga grumbled. He stopped when he realized the person standing in the doorway was not Kodachi. "Konatsu?" He hurriedly covered his groin with his hands and just as quickly pulled his hands away from the stab of pain his action caused.</p><p>"Oh, you poor thing." Konatsu cooed. He closed the door behind him. "You look so unhappy." Konatsu smiled. "Fortunately there is a cure."</p><p>"Yeah?" Ryoga looked up. "What? Give it to me." He demanded.</p><p>"Oh I plan to." Purred Konatsu. "Now you just sit there and let little Konatsu make you feel better." He knelt between Ryoga's legs.</p><p>"What?" Ryoga said nervously. 'Wait a minute. I don't, wait, stop. Oh gods that feels good."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane, Ranma and Ukyo sat in their darkened living room watching the television monitor. "Pass the popcorn." Akane said. "I'm glad we kept the camera running." She said. "Make him squeal like a pig Konatsu." She yelled at the screen. Akane laughed nastily. "Oh I can't wait to tell Ryoga that that wasn't part of the cure."<p>"Tomboy?"</p><p>"Yeah Ranma?"</p><p>"Got any of those packets left?"</p><p>"Oh I think there are a few left."</p><p>"Oh good." Ranma and Ukyo chorused.</p><p>End Chapter Six</p><p>Author's Notes: Sorry about the delays for any lemon requests. I'll get to them, I promise, it's just been busy.</p>
