</div><p>Chapter 6</p><p>'Busman's Holiday'</p><p>"You okay Kimi?" Nabiki asked in concern. "You've been jumpy recently."</p><p>Kimi blew out a breath. She was sitting on the edge of her bed. Nabiki sat on the floor next to her. "I have, haven't I?" She said in reluctant admission. "I'm sorry Nabs. I didn't mean to let you down."</p><p>"Let me down?" Nabiki said in disbelief. "How have you let me down?"</p><p>"I'm trying to be strong." Kimi said sadly. "But sometimes I just want to curl up in a ball and cry."</p><p>Nabiki scrambled to her feet and gathered Kimi in her arms. "Oh baby, why didn't you tell me?" She said. "I thought we told each other everything." She stroked Kimi's hair. "Tell you what. Why don't we take a short vacation?" She grinned. "Tatewaki has a yacht." She said enticingly. "You, me, Tatewaki and a very discrete crew." She whispered into Kimi's ear. "Doesn't that sound nice?"</p><p>"Yeah, it does." Kimi leaned against Nabiki. "How do you do it Nabs? How do you stay so controlled all the time? Even when we were in prison, you somehow took control of the situation."</p><p>Nabiki smiled briefly. "To tell you the truth, getting control is the easy part. It's losing it that scares me." She shrugged. "I think it's because I'm the middle child or something." She smiled when Kimi laughed. 'Good.' She thought. "Kasumi does nice. Akane does violence and I, I do deals."</p><p>Kimi sketched a short bow. "That you do, Oyabun." Kimi smiled more naturally. "Thanks baby, I needed that."</p><p>"Anytime." Nabiki replied. "And I'm serious about the vacation."</p><p>"I'd love a vacation." Kimi said longingly. She leaned her head on Nabiki's shoulder."But what about Hikaru?" Kimi asked.</p><p>"We've stopped Hikaru from swallowing the other families but he is still holding on to what he has." Nabiki replied. "But I hear he's not having an easy time with it." She smiled toothily. "And not only because of the Terrible Three." Nabiki nudged Kimi with her shoulder. "We've earned a break I think." Nabiki leaned her head closer to Kimi's. "I know what will make you feel better." She said throatily. With a slight push Nabiki had Kimi lying on the bed. Nabiki started to run her hand along Kimi's side. "I think I've been neglecting my girlfriend." Nabiki declared.</p><p>"Oh shut up and kiss me already." Kimi replied.</p><p>Nabiki laughed softly and quickly complied. With practiced ease, they slowly and sensuously removed each other's clothing. They wrapped their arms around each other. Love making between Kimi and Nabiki was slow. Even after more than a year together they continued to explore each other's bodies with wonder and desire. "It's just so good with you." Nabiki whispered at one point. Then she chuckled. "Remind me to apologize to Ranma when I next see him." She said. "Now," She purred. "Where was I?"</p><p>"Starting north and moving south rapidly." Kimi replied huskily. "Come on baby, stop teasing me."</p><p>"But it's so much fun." Nabiki  chuckled. "Has it been that long?"</p><p>"Yes." Kimi exclaimed.</p><p>Afterwards they lay in each other's arms. Kimi propped herself on one elbow and looked down at Nabiki. "How'd I get so lucky?" She said quietly.</p><p>"Funny, I was thinking exactly the same thing." Nabiki replied. She laughed. "I still remember the first time we met." Nabiki sighed in happy nostalgia. "You charging in all loud and brassy."</p><p>"I was scared spitless." Kimi lay back down and let herself be wrapped in Nabiki's arms. "My first time was pretty bad." Kimi cuddled closer. "Thanks Nabs." She said quietly. "For Satoh."</p><p>"Anytime baby." Nabiki replied sleepily. "No one hurts my best friend and gets away with it." They fell asleep in each other's arms.</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno inserted the key in the lock of the apartment and opened it. "I'm home." He called self-consciously. 'Home.' He thought in wonder. 'This is my home.' He walked into the apartment. It was quiet. Frowning Tatewaki went back to the door and opened it. "Sasuke." He called.</p><p>The diminutive and homely Ninja appeared from seemingly nowhere. "Yes Master?"</p><p>"All is quiet?" Tatewaki asked sharply. He relaxed when Sasuke nodded confidently. "And the search for Gos?"</p><p>"Still not found." Sasuky reported. "Master, I must assume he is either hidden or dead."</p><p>"Hidden?" Mused Tatewaki. "Not hiding?"</p><p>"Hidden Master." Sasuku replied firmly. "Whether voluntarily or not is open."</p><p>Tatewaki nodded in appreciation. "I take your meaning." Tatewaki rubbed his upper lip. "And the Amazons?"</p><p>"Quiet Master." Sasuke rubbed his projecting upper tooth absently. "Master, not to complain but how long will we be here?"</p><p>"As long as necessary." Tatewaki replied. He looked at his Ninja fondly. "It has been a difficult time for you hasn't it?" Tatewaki placed his hand on Sasuke's shoulder. "Go home, my friend. I can handle it from here. I don't think anything is going to happen any time soon."</p><p>Sasuke nodded reluctantly. "True master." Sasuke looked passed Tatewaki. "She does well." He said in grudging admiration.</p><p>"That she does, my friend, that she does." Tatewaki waved a hand. "Go. Do not return until I summon you." Sasuke nodded and vanished. Tatewaki walked back into the apartment. He closed and locked the door before removing his shoes. He walked to a wet bar and made himself a drink. The apartment was too quiet he decided. He picked up a remote and pressed a couple buttons and soft, almost meditative, music filled the silence. "Better." He walked over to his bedroom door and opened it. Tatewaki smiled ruefully. "I should have known." He said quietly as he beheld the two women on the rumpled bed. Tatewaki walked over to a recliner and sat down. He sipped his drink. "Sleep well My Ladies." He said quietly. "Your knight shall watch over you." Tatewaki sipped his drink. 'Only Nabiki Tendo would know the true path to my heart.' He mused silently. 'Finding a lover is easy. Finding a purpose.' Tatewaki silently toasted the sleeping women.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki slowly opened her eyes. "Wake up sleepyhead." She said quietly. She shook Kimi slightly. Kimi opened her eyes.<p>"Wha?" Said Kimi. She smiled sheepishly. "We fell asleep, didn't we?" Kimi unwound herself from Nabiki, sat up and stretched. She stopped in mid stretch and grinned. "Hello lover." She said to the seated Tatewaki.</p><p>Nabiki rolled over. "Baby." She said in pleasure. "Enjoying the view?" She arched her back slightly. "Why are you sitting way over there?" She patted the bed.</p><p>Tatewaki chuckled. "I didn't want to wake you." Tatewaki rose and sat on the edge of the bed. "You both looked," He smiled. "Angelic." Nabiki and Kimi laughed. Tatewaki's smile became slightly wider. "Aye, angelic doth suit you both." His smiled widened even more. "At least when you're asleep." He said slyly.</p><p>"You'll pay for that baby." Nabiki promised. She smiled shark-like. "With interest." She wrapped her arms around Tatewaki. "And I know just how you can pay us back." Nabiki nibbled on Tatewaki's ear lobe for a second. "I promised Kimi we'd take the yacht out."</p><p>"Did you now?" Tatewaki asked in an amused tone. "Well we wouldn't want you to break a promise."</p><p>"He gets smoother by the day, doesn't he Kimi?" Nabiki kissed Tatewaki on the cheek. "Good boy."</p><p>"Yeah he does." Kimi said cheerfully. "Thanks Tatewaki."</p><p>"You have but to ask My Lady." Tatewaki replied warmly. "And your every desire shall be granted." Tatewaki sketched a short bow. "I owe you both more than I can ever repay." He said seriously.</p><p>"The boy does have a way with words." Kim said in admiration. "You know Tatewaki, when you say it, I can almost believe I am a lady." Kimi sighed slightly. 'Gods, I think I'm falling in love with him.' She thought in dismay. She looked at Nabiki. 'But then again, I'm in love with you too girl.' Kimi shrugged internally. 'You know this ride is going to end one day,' She told herself. 'Might as well enjoy it while it lasts.' Kimi leaned against the pillow. "Why are you still dressed?" She asked warmly.</p><p>"See I told you she was smart." Nabiki said with a smile.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru Nakamura wiped the sweat from her face. She had been female for a week now. When she demanded she be returned to her male form, Cologne has bluntly said no. "You're too angry." Cologne had said. "Until you learn to control your anger you will never learn the 'Soul of Ice'." Hikaru still hadn't figured out how the Old Ghoul had locked her in female form and it worried her.<p>"Angry?" Hikaru had retorted. "Of course I'm angry; your great-granddaughter won't leave me alone." After a week, it was less that Hikaru was starting to enjoy Shampoo's masculine attention, (she wasn't but to Hikaru's dismay her body did,) and more that Shampoo seemed to go out of her (and his) way to get under Hikaru's skin.</p><p>"That is what she's supposed to do." Cologne replied coolly. "When you are able to control your emotions even when being," Cologne cackled. "Distracted." She said. "Only then will you be able to control the 'Soul of Ice."</p><p>"But why do I have to be a, a god-damned woman." Hikaru had almost shouted. "It can't be necessary."</p><p>"Normally, no." Cologne admitted. "But in your case, as it was for Ranma, once you learn it, you will be even more powerful than you could imagine." She had hopped over to Hikaru. "I taught Ranma the technique as a way for him to combat Happosai. To use Happi's battle chi against him. Ranma took it a step further. Several steps further. I searched the records and none have used the technique in the manner Ranma does. He is capable of generating a field of intense cold. I have seen him freeze water in seconds. More importantly, he never gets flustered. No matter how dire the fight, he continues to think, to analyze. It is my belief that the curse has something to do with it."</p><p>Slightly mollified, Hikaru returned to her training. It had taken a week but the metal bonds she wore now rarely contracted from the heat of her battle chi. Unfortunately Shampoo was still able to get to him.</p><p>"Hey Airen." Shampoo called. "We go out tonight, yes?" She snickered. "I have too-too pretty outfit for you to wear."</p><p>"I'm not wearing anything, arghh." Screamed Hikaru as the memory metal suddenly contracted.</p><p>"Enough for today." Cologne snapped in disgust. "Take a bath." She directed Hikaru. "We'll try again tomorrow." She muttered imprecations under her breath as she hopped away on her staff.</p><p>"Stop laughing bitch." Hikaru snarled in frustration. "And get me out of this thing."</p><p>"I no know Airen." Shampoo snickered. "You look good tied up." She walked over to the struggling Hikaru and pressed the release catch on the small of her back. The harness fell off with a metallic clatter. "Now you take bath like great-grandmother say." She lifted the transformed Hikaru to her feet. Shampoo easily dodged Hikaru's kick. "Much better Airen." She laughed. "But still not good enough." Shampoo grabbed Hikaru's extended leg and flipped the pink haired girl on her back.</p><p>Hikaru backflipped to her feet. 'She's trying to bait me again.' She thought. Hikaru took a breath and let it out slowly. "Not this time." She said coldly. Hikaru felt a cold calm fall over her. She took another slow breath.</p><p>"Wait till you see dress." Shampoo said cheerfully. "Every girl need little black dress."</p><p>"Yes." Hikaru said in a near monotone. "Black dress."</p><p>Shampoo narrowed her eyes and looked at Hikaru closely. Suddenly she turned and ran to the doorway. "Great grandmother, come quick." Shampoo ran back to Hikaru. Her eyes quickly took in Hikaru's stance. 'By the Ancestors, can it be?' She thought in suppressed excitement. 'Only one way to be sure.' Shampoo attacked.</p><p>It seemed to Hikaru that the cold entered into her very brain but instead of slowing her down she seemed to speed up instead. Hikaru felt more than saw Shampoo's attack. Her leg lifted to block the kick while she returned a punch to Shampoo's head.</p><p>"Shampoo what?" Cologne said testily as she returned to the training room. She rubbed her arms. "Cold." She grumbled. Cologne again looked sharply at Hikaru. "Coming from son-in-law?' She stopped and her eyes narrowed. 'Cold chi.' She realized. 'The boy's done it.' She watched the battle between Hikaru and Shampoo. "Good. Good." She murmured "Indeed. Now how long can she continue it?" She caught Shampoo's eyes and made a gesture.</p><p>Shampoo nodded. Suddenly there were two Shampoos, each seeming to move independantly and attacking Hikaru from all sides. Hikaru spun and dodged, becoming a blur. "I no think you wear bra with dress." Shampoo taunted. "I like watching breasts bounce." The double Shampoo's changed their attack. Instead of kicks and punches, Shampoo started tickling and pinching, especially the breasts she claimed she was so fond of.</p><p>Hikaru tried to ignore the feelings those touches engendered and for a short time succeeded. But the nature of Shampoo's attack was too much. The cold that enveloped Hikaru faltered then died.</p><p>"Enough." Cologne snapped. "I take it back son-in-law, you may be just who we were seeking after all." She smiled coldly. "You have learned the technique but you still need control." The old woman shook her head. "A few touches here and there and you lost control." She raised her hand. "Again, do you think Ranma will refrain from such tactics? More importantly, do you think such tactics would work on him?"</p><p>Hikaru took a deep breath. Though still somewhat overcome by what she had just accomplished she, for once, listened to the old woman's words. She let the breath out. "No." She replied slowly. "They wouldn't. He uses sex as a weapon."</p><p>"Finally." Cologne cackled. "You've figured it out. A potent weapon, is it not?" She nodded in approval. "I had despaired of you learning any wisdom; I am gratified to be proven wrong." She waved a dismissive hand. "However, you still need a bath." She hopped away on her staff.</p><p>Shampoo took Hikaru's arm and led her away to the bathing area. Hikaru let herself be led without resisting, so engrossed was she on what had happened. 'The clarity.' She mused in awe. 'No wonder Ranma is so confident.' She barely acknowledged Shampoo pouring the cold water over her and didn't react when Shampoo started to soap up her back. It wasn't until Shampoo's touches became more intimate that Hikaru finally reacted. "You don't stop, do you?" Hikaru said in even tones. "I'm too tired."</p><p>"Since when that make difference?" Shampoo asked coldly. "It never stop you."</p><p>"Well I want you to stop, okay?" Hikaru growled. "I'm tired and I'm definitely not in the mood." Hikaru pushed Shampoo's hands off of her. "You may like it but I don't." She jabbed herself in the chest with a thumb. "I'm a guy."</p><p>"You no look like guy." Shampoo said in a teasing yet cold tone. "You look like pink haired slut."</p><p>Hikaru took a deep breath and tried to recapture that cold clarity she had experienced earlier but she was already too angry and too frightened. "Well I'm telling you," She emphasized. "I'm a guy."</p><p>Shampoo laughed. "You sound just like Ranma." She said. "Now look at him." Shampoo grinned in recollection. She had finally tracked down her quarry. Shampoo, in cat form, had watched the entire evening. Shampoo then followed the trio home. 'Aiyah,' She thought in jealousy and admiration. From her perch on the window, she watched, to her astonishment, Akane transform into a man. What she saw, "He not care what he is."</p><p>"You still call him 'he' I noticed." Hikaru said in an attempt to distract Shampoo.</p><p>"That only cause that what he was," She explained. "Then. Not now." She gave Hikaru a glare. "Great-grandmother right, Ranma so powerful because he both." Shampoo's voice became a growl. "You think I not try learn 'soul of ice'?" She demanded. "I learn." She snapped. "But I still not able do, what Ranma do. Secret." She jabbed Hikaru sharply in the stomach. Hikaru barely finched. "Secret is Ranma balance yin and yang. Male and Female essence in perfect harmony." She jabbed Hikaru again. Then she raised her hand. "Take it." She demanded. A faint glow formed around Shampoo's hand. "Take my hand."</p><p>Hikaru looked at Shampoo's hand in surprise. She slowly reached for the hand. When she had nearly touched the hand Hikaru stopped. "Shit." She exclaimed. "That's cold." She looked at Shampoo sharply. "How long?" She asked.</p><p>"Not long." Shampoo gave Hikaru an almost leer. "Just after." The glow faded. "This new. Not hold long." She leaned closer to Hikaru. Hikaru didn't pull away. "You think I like being man? You think I like you be woman?" She breathed. "No. I all woman. Like feel man inside me. First time, did it because I want you know what it feel like with you."</p><p>"I'm not that rough." Hikaru returned in surprise.</p><p>"You can be." Shampoo shrugged. "It good thing I like rough." Shampoo was almost nose to nose with Hikaru. "But that not point. Point is being man different, must think different. Just like being woman you need think different." She shrugged again. "Maybe it easier for woman to be man."</p><p>"Probably." Hikaru grunted. "It's just feels wrong."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hey sugar." Ukyo said from the door way of the bedroom she shared with Akane. "Why the long face?"<p>Akane blinked. "Oh hey Ukyo." Akane shook herself. "Daydreaming." She smiled. "Actually I'm in a pretty good mood."</p><p>"Yeah?" Ukyo tilted her head and gave Akane an appraising glance. "You don't look it." Her eyes narrowed slightly. "Want to talk about it?" She sat down and leaned against the headboard.</p><p>Akane's mouth turned up briefly. "You'll laugh." She said.</p><p>Ukyo smiled. "Try me."</p><p>"I was thinking about my life." She played with the hem of her sweatshirt. "I started listing all the things that were wrong with it." She said. "You know; being a stripper, running a protection racket, Ranma and you, those things." Akane leaned back against the bed. "The funny thing is, try as I might, I couldn't really get angry." She looked at Ukyo. "The protection racket isn't really a racket, is it?" Ukyo made a sound of agreement. "Ranma is still in my life." Then Akane laughed. "And I'm a damn good stripper."</p><p>"You mean you finally realized how hot you really are." Ukyo supplied. "How about me, sugar?" She asked.</p><p>"To be honest," Akane grinned. "Sugar." She said. "There's no one I'd rather have watching my back."</p><p>"Same here sugar." Ukyo said. "We make a damn good team."</p><p>"I'd say get a room." Came a voice from the bedroom door. A grinning Ranma was leaning against the doorway. "But you already have one." He walked into the room and sat between Ukyo and Akane. "Quite a love fest you two."</p><p>"You're asking for it Saotome." Akane growled cheerfully.</p><p>"Ooh, big talk Tomboy." Ranma chuckled. "What ya gonna do about it?"</p><p>Akane edged closer and laid her head on Ranma's shoulder. "Whatever you want Ranma." Akane said easily. "Funny thing, it's usually what I want too."</p><p>"Same here." Ukyo sat down on Ranma's other side and laid her head on his shoulder. "Want to stay in our room tonight?</p><p>Ranma chuckled and put his arms around the two girls and pulled them closer. "I'd love to." He said.</p><p>"Still think you should just move into our bedroom." Muttered Akane.</p><p>"I dunno Tomboy." Ranma said. "Sometimes I like my privacy."</p><p>"You just like it when we ask." Akane shot back. Akane looked down. "Please Ranma." She said. "It's always lonely when you're not there."</p><p>"At least give it try, sugar." Ukyo said from Ranma's other side. "A month. Just for a month."</p><p>"I dunno." Ranma said again. "What if I just want to sleep with just one of you?"</p><p>"Then the one left out sleeps in your old room." Akane said. "Hell Ranma, if you want I'll sleep in your room tonight and you can sleep with Ukyo."</p><p>"Uh uh sugar." Ukyo shot back. She jabbed herself in the chest. "I'll sleep in the other room."</p><p>"Hey. Hey." Laughed Ranma. "I thought you both wanted me tonight?"</p><p>"We do." Chorused Akane and Ukyo. "But we want you all the time." Akane finished. She blushed slightly. "Ah hell Ranma, whatever you want, all we want is to be your partners, your lovers," She smiled briefly,"your friends." She looked at Ukyo for a moment. Ukyo nodded firmly. "Whatever you want, as long as we're with you."</p><p>"What she said, sugar." Ukyo added. "We're better together."</p><p>Ranma looked thoughtful. "I dunno." He raised a hand. "I'm not saying no, it's just." Ranma smiled slightly. "It's been workin so well, I'm just kinda afraid of ruining it."</p><p>Akane and Ukyo exchanged looks. "Oh geez Ranma, unless you're seeing someone we don't know about, it won't change a thing." Akane said in exasperation. Akane took a breath then let it out slowly. "Even if you are, it doesn't change a thing." She said finally.</p><p>"It doesn't?" Ranma asked in surprise.</p><p>Akane shook her head. "That's what started this whole mess." She said with a twinge of self hate in her voice. "You're here, Ukyo and I both know you could leave; will leave probably, one day." Akane rolled her tight shoulders. "If," Akane licked dry lips, "when you do, we, we want to always be friends."</p><p>"You know you're getting really good at self-control." Observed Ranma.</p><p>Akane blinked at the change of topic. "Thank you Ranma." Akane replied slowly.</p><p>"In fact, you're getting so good; I think you should try to do the Soul of Ice." Ranma continued. He grinned at the gulp coming from Akane.</p><p>"R-really?" Akane stammered. "I don't," Akane stopped. "If you're willing to teach me, I'll try."</p><p>"Oh I've been teaching you for awhile." Ranma replied coolly. "Maybe not the same way the old ghoul taught me but I've been teaching you." He said. "What I said is that I want you to try to do it."</p><p>"Teaching Ran-chan?" Ukyo said in confusion. "The soul of ice requires a person to be," Ukyo swallowed, "humiliated." She whispered in horrified realization. "Shit." She exclaimed.</p><p>"You are a total bastard, you know that Saotome?" Akane added. "Are you trying to tell us that all this," Akane waved her hand, "was just to teach us the Soul of Ice?"</p><p>"Well not at the beginning but it was too good an opportunity to pass up." Ranma smiled slightly. Ranma grabbed his pigtail and looked at the end. "Still want me to move into the bedroom?" Ranma asked in innocent tones.</p><p>Akane gave Ranma a sour look then nodded. "You're still a bastard but yeah."</p><p>"Well if you both weren't so hard headed." Ranma replied cheerfully. "Especially you Tomboy, damn I never thought you'd learn to control your temper." He shook his head. "You don't know how many times I was tempted to just give up."</p><p>"Sorry Ranma." Akane said contritely. "Thank you for not giving up on me."</p><p>"Me too Ran-chan." Ukyo sat up. "So what do we do?"</p><p>"That's my girls." Ranma said in approval. "The thing is, the Soul of Ice is really similar to the Umisenken or the Moko Takabishi or even, maybe especially, the shi shi hokodan, the difference is how the Chi is controlled." Ranma reached behind him and grabbed his pigtail. "All require that you feel the Chi. You already know how to do that. Think about how your chi feels when you use it to power a jump. It feels hot, doesn't it?" Akane and Ukyo nodded vigorously. "The calmer and cooler you are, the cooler your Chi."</p><p>"That's it?" Akane said in disbelief.</p><p>"Well, not quite." Ranma replied. "There's one more thing, and this one is hard to explain, but you have to,' Ranma looked at the end of his pigtail. "Yuck, split ends." He grumbled. "You have to balance it."</p><p>"Balance it?" Ukyo looked across Ranma to Akane. "You have any idea what he means sugar?"</p><p>Akane frowned. "Maybe." She said after a moment's thought. "There's a slight difference in my Chi when I'm a boy," She turned her head to look at Ranma. "Is that what I'm supposed to balance Ranma?"</p><p>"Very good Tomboy." Ranma replied. "I wasn't sure you noticed."</p><p>"I didn't." Grumped Ukyo.</p><p>"I don't think you change often enough." Ranma guessed. "You know how much the Tomboy likes to switch hit."</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "Got you there sugar." Ukyo snickered. Then she frowned. "Wait a minute." She said. "Does that mean I can't learn the Soul of Ice?"</p><p>"Nope. You should be able to master the Hiryo Shoten Ha, but," Ranma lifted his arms and leaned forward. "Well, look." He raised his hands and concentrated. It seemed to Ukyo that Ranma's voice took on a monotone and his face became devoid of all expression except for a serene smile that appeared on his lips. Ukyo felt a wave of cold emanate from Ranma's hands. Ranma blinked and the cold vanished. "That's what I'm talking about." He said. "The Hiryo Shoten Ha just requires that your Chi is cooler than your opponents this,' He nodded at his hands, "this is something else." He gave Akane a nod. "The Tomboy put her finger on it." He smiled. "If I didn't notice the difference I'd never have figured it out."</p><p>Ukyo laughed again. "I can't wait until the training starts."</p><p>"That's the attitude, Uk-chan." Ranma agreed easily. "One more thing." Ranma said. "There's something you should know. When you do it right, you don't always wanna come back." He sighed. "Your mind becomes so clear. No emotions. No distractions." His mouth turned up on one side. "No desires." He said almost regretfully.</p><p>"Wow." Akane whispered respectfully.</p><p>"It's a cold place." Ranma continued. "But restful, you know what I mean?"</p><p>"Not right now Ran-chan." Ukyo said seriously yet with a touch of humor. "Though I think Akane is going to find out pretty soon."</p><p>"Oh I hope so." Akane said feelingly. Akane launched herself to her feet. "Come on Ranma. Let me try."</p><p>"That was the general idea." Ranma replied. He leaned back against the bed. "Okay Tomboy, listen carefully." Ranma narrowed his eyes as he gazed at Akane. "Your Chi responds to emotion right?" After a moment Akane nodded. Ranma smiled. "Even the Umisenken uses emotion in a way; you suppress your physical presence, now you need to suppress your emotional presence." He grinned. "Ya gotta chill, Tomboy."</p><p>"Easy for you to say." Akane muttered. Akane took a breath and held if for a second before letting it out slowly. 'Shut up.' She told her inner voice. 'I gotta concentrate.' Akane let herself relax. 'Chi and emotions.' She thought. She pulled her chi in to herself like she did for the Umisenken but this time tried to tie her emotions to it. She felt a cool calm descend over her thoughts. Ranma's half heard murmurs of 'Good. Good.', encouraged her to continue. The calm continued to descend and then seemed to hit a point where it could go no further. Akane knew it wasn't far enough and struggled to break through. Akane felt anger and frustration begin to build and her attempts to control her chi ended with an almost audible snap. "Can't." She gasped.</p><p>"You were almost there Tomboy." Ranma said encouragingly.</p><p>"That was weird sugar." Ukyo rubbed her upper lip. "I could feel your chi changing, getting cooler."</p><p>"You gonna try Uk-chan?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Not right now Ran-chan." Ukyo replied seriously. "I want to see what Akane does first." Ukyo said from behind her hand. "I've a feeling the Tomboy is going to need to have someone watch her back."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Oh, I don't think you'll hurt yourself Tomboy but Uk-chan can watch you just in case you get lost." Ranma chewed the inside of his cheek as he thought. "Hard to explain but, like I said, sometimes it's hard to come back."</p><p>"You said you don't want to." Ukyo corrected.</p><p>"Yeah, well when you get there you'll understand." Ranma grinned. "In the meantime, how bout helping me move in?" Ranma laughed when Akane and Ukyo seemed to vanish. "Damn." He said as he followed. "After all the crap I keep putting them through," He shook his head. "Maybe I'll be nicer to'em for a while." Ranma thought about it. "Nah." He decided. "I don't want them to get soft."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"You seem pensive son-in-law." Rasped Cologne. She walked over to Hikaru. "Don't tell me you miss being female."<p>Hikaru rolled his eyes. "Not likely." Hikaru looked out the window of the warehouse office. "I'm too emotional." He said. "Too angry."</p><p>'Excellent.' The old woman thought. 'He begins to think.' She offered the young man a rare smile of approval. "That was one of the reasons I showed you how to master the Soul of Ice." She admitted to Hikaru's surprise. "You have great potential. I know of one other with similar potential and the same level of anger." She smiled coldly. "I think, with time, I could have brought her under my control." She said. 'Or killed her.' She thought. "Akane Tendo."</p><p>A retort died on Hikaru's lips. "I'm surprised." He said instead. "I agree she is skilled but," Hikaru trailed off. "I may not like you old ghoul, but I'm listening."</p><p>Cologne smiled a toothless smile. "Liking me is not required. Listening is." She cackled. "You are correct, you are too angry. Oh in the past your anger was necessary but no longer." She said. "And if you are to progress further you must learn control."</p><p>"I'm listening." Hikaru said evenly.</p><p>"Yes you are." She replied. "Finally." She pointed at Hikaru with the head of her staff. 'Have you been successful in repeating your performance since you returned to your male form?"</p><p>"You know I haven't old ghoul." Hikaru took a breath. "What am I doing wrong?"</p><p>"That's the wrong question, son-in-law." Cologne rasped. "The question is; what did you do right before."</p><p>"I was a girl before." Snarled Hikaru.</p><p>"Obviously." Cologne said dryly. "What else?"</p><p>"I was fending off Shampoo, for another." Hikaru said in grumpy tones. The memory of the passed week still ate at him. 'I trying to stay a guy inside and the dumb bitch decides,' Hikaru's thought broke off. "Tell me something old ghoul; how much of Shampoo's actions were because she wanted to and how much because you wanted her to?"</p><p>Cologne cackled in delight. "Follow that thought, son-in-law." She said. "Yes, I encouraged her to be, shall we say, aggressive."</p><p>"Shampoo said she thinks it's easier for a girl to be a guy." He said musingly. "Oh crap." He said suddenly. He turned to the cackling Cologne. "There's got to be another way." He almost shouted. "I can't do it."</p><p>"Ranma could." Cologne said seriously. "I suspect the others will soon follow." She said. 'Not if what Shampoo reported is true and I have no reason to doubt her.' She thought anxiously. 'Three will be too many if Hikaru cannot master this.' Cologne pulled out her pipe and filled it. She took her time and watched Hikaru out of the corner of her eyes. 'He does not fidget.' She observed. "You are so close Hikaru." She said after she blew out a white cloud of smoke. "In truth I don't know if the secret is because Ranma has embraced his girl side but I do know your chi must be balanced. If there is another way, you must discover it quickly."</p><p>Hikaru gave Cologne a preoccupied bow and walked off. Cologne watched him walk off. "Find it soon son-in-law." She said quietly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kimi lay on a deck chair enjoying the sun. The yacht was a marvel; fully fifty feet in length, it was designed expressly for the comfort of its passengers. The small crew, were courteous, efficient and, above all, discrete. Kimi put some more lotion over her bare breasts.<p>"Mind if we join you?"</p><p>Kimi looked up. "Hey Nabs. Hey lover." She made to get up. "Let me move over so the two of you can be together."</p><p>"Don't bother Kimi." Nabs lay down in the lounge chair on Kimi's right. Tatewaki took the other on Kimi's left. Tatewaki raised a hand and a, hitherto unnoticed servant, hurried over with a frosted metal wine bucket. A bottle was stuck inside. The servant set the bucket on a folding tray next to Tatewaki and proceeded to open the bottle. He poured some of the crisp white wine into a glass and offered it to Tatewaki. After a lengthy consideration Tatewaki nodded and the servant poured wine for Nabiki and Kimi.</p><p>"Oh yum." Kimi said after a sip.</p><p>"Enjoying yourself baby?" Nabiki asked Kimi.</p><p>Kimi grinned widely. "Oh yeah." She said cheerfully. "Wherever did you find that masseuse?" She asked Tatewaki. "She's amazing." She lifted the glass in a toast. "She had me purring like a kitten."</p><p>Tatewaki chuckled. "A good masseuse, like a good chef, is worth their weight in gold." He said with a touch of smugness. "Are they not?"</p><p>"Good thing we're lovers, lover." Nabiki said cheerfully. "Or I'd try to steal her from you."</p><p>"You could try." Tatewaki said confidently. "I believe she is suitably remunerated and, more importantly, very appreciated." Tatewaki smiled across Kimi at Nabiki. "Still it is possible she is overdue for a raise."</p><p>"That's cheating lover." Nabiki mock grumped. She lay back in the lounge and took a sip of her wine. Her gaze traversed the blue water. The coastline was a blue line in the distance. 'It's so peaceful.' She thought. 'Just what Kimi needed.' She glanced over to the woman who had become so much a part of her life in such a short time. Kimi was chatting amiably with Tatewaki. She silently raised her glass in a toast. 'To you Kimi Ota. My best friend.' Nabiki sipped her wine and sat back. Again her eyes scanned the blue horizon. Her eyes suddenly narrowed. "What's that?" She asked. Nabiki pointed.</p><p>Tatewaki followed Nabiki's pointing finger. "Another boat perhaps?" He said uncertainly. Tatewaki raised a hand and the same servant appeared seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p>"I love the way they do that." Kimi whispered to Nabiki. Kimi watched the servant, a young man, quickly lift his head and look toward the ocean. Kimi could see the man's eyes narrow. Then the man darted away. "What?"</p><p>"Probably nothing." Tatewaki said calmly. "Still it might be best if the two of you went below." Tatewaki stood and another servant appeared holding Tatewaki's sword. "Lock the door behind you."</p><p>Nabiki looked at Kimi. The woman she considered her best friend looked suddenly pale and afraid. Nabiki could see Kimi struggled to maintain her composure. She caught Nabiki's look. "Nabs?" She said in a near whisper.</p><p>"Forget that Tatewaki." She looked around spotted one of the crewmembers. The man looked serious but not afraid. She waved him over. "You." She said. "Stay with us." She ordered. "And have someone get us a weapon."</p><p>The crewman looked at Tatewaki first then opened his jacket and pulled out a gun. "Can you use one of these?" He asked. To his surprise Kimi was the one who reached for the weapon. "I can." She declared. Kimi waited until the crewman handed the weapon before she started checking it's actions. Kimi nodded. "This'll be fine." She said. Kimi smiled faintly. "I'm okay now." She said to Nabiki. "Just stay close, okay?"</p><p>"Like siamese twins baby." Nabiki assured Kimi. She looked at Tatewaki. "We'll be fine. Go kick butt." Nabiki watched as Kimi placed the gun in her waistband. While Nabiki was determined to prevent guns from coming into Japan, or at least her part of it, she wasn't foolish enough to dismiss the importance of having weaponry of her own.</p><p>Tatewaki smiled and essayed a short bow to the two women. "Never fear my ladies none shall get near thee whilst I live."</p><p>"Try to do that too, okay lover?" Kimi said. "Try real hard."</p><p>Tatewaki smiled and bowed again. Then he turned and walked away. Tatewaki waved over a senior member of the crew. "What saith thou?" He asked.</p><p>"Pirates." The man, a lieutenant, said gravely. "They can outrun us milord."</p><p>"Weapons?" Tatewaki asked.</p><p>"One cannon and two mounted guns." The man replied. "We can out fight them." The man replied. A slightly anticipatory smile appeared on his lips. "The Captain is awaiting your orders."</p><p>"We found a rats nest Lieutenant." Tatewaki replied cooly. "Have I ever told you how much I hate rats?." He nodded toward the approaching ship. "They'll probably fire a warning shot first. Or two." He smiled. "Yes definitely two."</p><p>"Yes sir." The lietenant replied. "I'll inform the Captain." The man hurried away. Tatewaki folded his hands behind his back and watched the approaching ship. There was a flash. A moment later the boom of the cannon was heard. A geyser of water arose a hundred yards to Tatewaki's right. Tatewaki felt his ship accelerate under his feet. The approaching pirate ship still closed the gap between ships. There was another flash. The boom of the cannon was not that far behind. The geyser of water was much closer. Tatewaki felt the engines slow.</p><p>Tatewaki looked around. Nabiki and Kimi were nowhere to be seen. Tatewaki nodded and continued his visual scan. His eyes picked up two of his men as they moved into position. He turned his head to watch the pirate ship approach. Tatewaki fought to keep a sneer from his face. 'Sloppy.' He thought in assessment. The sneer finally forced itself on to Tatewaki's face as a half dozen unshaven men clambered on board. One, a monster of a man and obviously the leader, approached Tatewaki.</p><p>"Good thing you stopped." The man growled menacingly. "The next one was going through your hull." He looked around. "Nice ship." He said in approval. "I think I'll keep it."</p><p>"It's not for sale." Tatewaki replied coldly.</p><p>"Who said anything about buying it?" The man laughed cruelly. "I said, I think I'll keep it."</p><p>"That is not possible." Tatewaki said calmly.</p><p>"I wasn't giving you a choice." The man's face reflected his puzzlement then anger at Tatewaki's manner. "Listen shithead,' Began the man, 'Oh fuck it." He finished and swung the butt of his rifle at Tatewaki's stomach. His intention to disable the annoying little shit in front of him didn't come off as expected as the butt of the rifle was deflected with a negligent swipe of Tatewaki's hand. The pirate was an old hand of rough and tumble fighting though and without blinking the rifle changed direction and aimed for Tatewaki's head. To the pirate's surprise the followup blow also missed.</p><p>There was a ringing sound as Tatewaki drew his sword. The pirate took one look at the sword and took a step back and raised the rifle. He pulled the trigger and fired. Tatewaki's sword blurred and there was a sudden flash of light. The pirate stepped back again. "I couldn't have missed at this range." He pulled the trigger again and again the sword flashed. Tatewaki stood untouched .</p><p>With a snarl of anger the pirate flipped a switch on the rifle. "Let's see how you handle," He began, "What?" He finished when Tatewaki flashed forward and slashed with his sword. The pirate instinctively raised the rifle protectively. There was the faintest of pressure and the pirate's rifle was sliced neatly in two. Tatewaki stepped forward his sword suddenly under the pirate's chin. "Don't bother calling for your men." Tatewaki said quietly. "All's well Captain?" He called without taking his eyes off the pirate leader.</p><p>"All's well milord." Came the voice of the ship's Captain.</p><p>The pirate leader spun around. All his men were disarmed and being restrained. He spun around again to face Tatewaki. He looked in the swordsman's eyes and swallowed nervously. The look in Tatewaki's eyes was cold and unforgiving.</p><p>"Captain." Called Tatewaki without taking his eyes off of the pirate leader. "Search the ship." He nodded his head toward the pirate's vessel. "And take this away."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki stood on the bridge of his yacht. Nabiki and Kimi both now dressed, sat in chairs against a small table. They had decided to move to this spot while Tatewaki's men searched the ship. The Captain strode on to the deck.<p>He was an older man his short cropped hair was mostly gray as was the neat mustache on his upper lip. Captain Osigi was too young to have served in the Japanese Imperial Navy of World war II but you could easily have imagined him having done so. A twenty year veteran of the small navy allowed by treaty he was immediately hired by the Kuno's upon retirement. He had been with the Kuno clan ever since. It was an easy job, or had been until recently. Captain Osigi approved of the change. He approved even more of the change in the young Kuno. 'By all the Kamis, he's grown some balls.' He thought as he walked in. 'His father certainly wouldn't have done the same.' He walked over to Tatewaki and gave the young man a respectful bow. "We've completed our preliminary search of the vessel, milord." There was a note of anger in Captain Osigi's voice. "We found," Captain Osigi hesitated and looked toward Nabiki and Kimi. "Two women milord." Captain said. "I had them brought to the infirmary."</p><p>Kimi stood. "I'll take a look." She said to Nabiki.</p><p>"Would you?" The Captain said gratefully. "I must warn you one is in pretty bad shape."</p><p>"I'm on it." Kimi ran out of the bridge. She ran toward the infirmary as fast as she was able to. "Women!" Growled Kimi angrily. She had a good idea what the Captain meant by 'bad shape'. "Someone is swimming home." She promised herself. She reached the infirmary slightly breathless but charged in. "Where are they?" She snapped to the nearest orderly. The orderly reflexively pointed. Kimi nodded and walked through a curtain. Two women were lying on side-by-side examining tables in the well equipped infirmary. The ship's doctor was examining one. The bruises were visible even from where Kimi stood. "How is she?" Kimi demanded.</p><p>"She'll live." The Doctor replied abstractedly as he continued his ministrations. He snapped something to an orderly who hurried over with a tray.</p><p>"Who you?" Demanded a voice. "This you ship?" Kimi turned. She looked at the other woman. Except for a slight bruise under one eye she seemed barely touched. "I'm Kimi." Kimi replied. "Who are you?"</p><p>"Ting Li." The woman replied. She was obviously Chinese though she seemed mixed with something else. She never had heard of a Chinese, or anyone else for that matter, with bright orange hair. Something about the name nagged at Kimi. "Joksetsuzoku?" She hazarded.</p><p>Ting Li nodded firmly. "Where my weapons?" She demanded. "I have filthy pig to skin." She growled. "Would have done with teeth if they not gang up on me."</p><p>Despite the situation Kimi snorted in amusement. "Point him out sister." She declared. "One question." She said a moment later.</p><p>Ting Li looked at Kimi curiously. "Question?"</p><p>"Yeah, you want the knife sharpened first?" Kimi replied. "Personally I'd use a dull one."</p><p>Ting Li laughed. "Maybe use spoon." She said. "What name again?"</p><p>Kimi jabbed herself in the chest with a thumb. "Kimi. Kimi Ota." She replied. "And if they did what I'm pretty sure they did to your friend," Kimi raised her short jacket. The gun the Lieutenant had given her was still there.</p><p>Ting Li nodded at the Doctor and the orderly, both men. "I know men, they protect each other, they try stop you."</p><p>The doctor turned in his seat. "I will do what our Lord decides to do." He said somberly. "I doubt he will raise a finger to save any of those vermin." He tapped his chest with the palm of his hand. "I for one will not speak in their defense." He turned his chair and returned to his treatment of the injured woman.</p><p>"Who this Lord?" Demanded Ting Li. "Tell him I want see him."</p><p>"Don't worry, you'll see him." Kimi promised. She tapped the doctor on the shoulder. "You finished with Ting Li?' She asked. "I want Nabs to hear this." The Doctor waved Kimi off irritably and told her to take the Amazon. Kimi walked to the ship intercom. "Nabs? You there?"</p><p>"How are they Kimi?" Came Nabiki's voice.</p><p>"The Doctor is working on one of them. The other," Kimi looked at Ting Li. "Nabs. The other is Joketsuzoku."</p><p>"I'll be right down." Nabiki replied.</p><p>"Bring a change of clothes. She's about your size." Kimi replied. "I figured you'd prefer wearing something other than that." She indicated the medical gown the Amazon was wearing.</p><p>"Is Nabs, Lord, healer talk about?" Ting Li asked. She tilted her head questioningly.'She know Joketsuzoku.' She thought. 'She and this Nabs consider it important.'</p><p>"No." Kimi laughed. "That's Tatewaki Kuno." Kimi waved her hand to indicate the ship. "This is his." She waved her hands. "Look, let's get you out of here first and then we'll talk. Okay?" Kimi sat down on the edge of the bed. "You're probably hungry."</p><p>"Could eat." Ting Li admitted. 'So trusting.' She thought in mild derision. 'Joketsuzoku not be so sloppy.' Ting Li leaned against the headboard. 'I could leave at any time.' She realized. 'She knows Joketsuzoku.' She thought to herself again. 'Maybe she knows where Honored Elder Cologne is hiding."</p><p>Kimi called over the orderly. "Have dinner sent to our suite." She told the orderly. "Tell the chef to make something hearty." The orderly nodded and ran off.</p><p>Ting Li raised an eyebrow. 'She may not look powerful but they listen to her.' She looked at Kimi. 'And I don't think it has to do with that gun.' She narrowed her eyes. 'Interesting.' She looked up as someone walked through the curtain. The woman was about her height but seemed to radiate authority. She glanced over to the Doctor who looked up and gave the newcomer a respectful nod. The woman walked over to the bed and handed Ting Li a bag.</p><p>"Hi I'm Nabiki." Nabiki said.</p><p>"Ting Li." Ting Li replied. "You leader here?"</p><p>"In some things, yes." Nabiki replied. She grinned. "The important things."</p><p>Ting Li looked in the bag. "Robe?" She said in confusion.</p><p>"Well I didn't expect you to change in here." Nabiki replied. "Come on, you'll change in our suite, have something to eat and," Nabiki smiled, "talk." She stood away from the bed. "Whenever you're ready." Ting Li quickly put on the robe. Nabiki waved a hand. "After you."</p><p>Ting Li smiled slightly and walked out of the infirmary, she was quickly flanked by Nabiki and Kimi. They were, Ting Li noticed in approval, trailed by two very competent looking men. "Guards?" She asked.</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Bodyguards." She amplified. "There are those who'd prefer I'd," Nabiki smiled coldly. 'Disappear." She led Ting Li to the stateroom she shared with Kimi and Tatewaki. Kimi opened the door and led them inside. A table had been set. Kimi walked over and grabbed a bottle of water and opened it. She took a swallow then handed the bottle to Nabiki. Nabiki took the bottle and then nodded at the table. "If you want we'll eat first."</p><p>Ting Li snorted and walked over to the table and starting assembling a meal. "I pretty certain you not try poison me." She looked at the meal. "Could still drug but think not."</p><p>Nabiki accepted a salad Kimi had made for her and sat down on a chair. Kimi sat on the arm of the chair and snagged bits of the salad."Is that how they caught you in the first place?" Kimi asked.</p><p>Ting Li grimaced. "No." She admitted reluctantly. "Was stupid, got trapped in alley." She made a stabbing motion with her chopsticks. "Got one good though." She said with a faint smile.</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "Good for you." She said in approval. "Don't worry about your friend, the Doctor is pretty good."</p><p>"Not friend. Not know her." Ting Li replied. "She already there." A angry grimace appeared on her face. "Not right what they do to her." She declared. "I know Japans. They let them go."</p><p>"That's assuming the Japanese authorities even find out about them." Nabiki replied coldly. "Let me properly introduce myself."</p><p>"Let me do it Nabs. You know what a kick I get out of it." Kimi said eagerly. "Ting Li may I introduce you to Nabiki Tendo, Oyabun of the Tendo Yakusa but you can call her 'The Ice Queen'."</p><p>"Oyabun?" Ting Li asked. She rubbed her chin. "That like Tong leader, yes?" She smiled at Nabiki's nod. "Impressed, Not think Japans woman able do that." Ting Li cupped a fist in a palm and shook it at Nabiki while she bowed. "I Ting Li of the Joketsuzoku." She said proudly. "This year Village Champion."</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow.'Ranma told me about that.' She thought to herself. She smiled. "So, you're Joketsuzoku." She said. "Not too many leave the village." She said musingly.</p><p>Ting Li nodded. "On mission to bring home missing Joketsuzoku. They ordered home not obey."</p><p>Nabiki's eyebrows rose even higher. "You're here to take them home. Whether they wan't to go or not?" She stated questioningly. When Ting Li nodded. Nabiki smiled shark-like. "Their names wouldn't happen to be Cologne and Shampoo would it?"</p><p>"You know them." Ting Li accused. "Tell me where, now." She demanded.</p><p>Nabiki raised her hands placatingly. "Easier said than done lady." Nabiki said seriously. "They've acquired an army to protect them." She raised a finger. "They've also been importing drugs and weapons into Japan."</p><p>Ting Li shrugged. "Not care about that."</p><p>"Well I do." Snapped Nabiki. "And I'm going to stop them."</p><p>Ting Li and Nabiki stared into each other's eyes in a silent battle of wills. It was Ting Li who blinked first. "Okay so you stop them." Muttered Ting Li. "Not really care what happen to Japans, must bring them home."</p><p>"I'd like to see that happen as well." Nabiki replied evenly. She looked at the Joketsuzoku warrior in front of her. 'Smart. Tough and she's not bullshitting.' She turned her head. "Kimi?"</p><p>"She could have escaped at least three times since I've been with her." Kimi replied. She flashed Ting Li a knowing grin. "Probably thought I was stupid sitting so close, didn't you?"</p><p>"I doubt you would have gotten five feet." Nabiki added. She grinned at the drop mouthed expression on the Amazon's face. "Everyone and I mean everyone on this ship is a trained martial artist."</p><p>"Well I'm still really a beginner." Kimi admitted. "But the Doctor is, what, second Dan I think, in Shodokan." She looked at Ting Li. "If you had hurt me, maybe less than five feet." She added cooly.</p><p>"Much less." Agreed Nabiki. "I want to be very clear, Ting Li." She gave the Amazon a cold look. "Right now you have some sympathy capital; spend it wisely."</p><p>Ting Li stared into Nabiki's eyes. To her surprise she found that she was the one to break the stare down once again. She gave a short bow. "I had pouch with important papers; if you find; it explain."</p><p>"Your orders?" Kimi asked. Ting Li nodded somberly. "Why don't you tell us what your orders were." She suggested.</p><p>Ting Li looked down and realized she was still in a robe. "You say you have something I wear?" She asked. "Promise I tell all."</p><p>Kimi stood. She beckoned Ting Li with a finger. "Come along." She said. Without waiting to see if Ting Li followed, Kimi walked into the bedroom.</p><p>Ting Li looked at Nabiki. "She too trusting." She said to Nabiki.</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "Sometimes." She agreed. "But she's a real fighter in her own way." Nabiki nodded her head. "I'll keep it in mind."</p><p>Ting Li nodded back and walked away and entered the bedroom. Kimi was at a small wardrobe and leafing through some clothing. As Ting Li approached she could see the clothing was for two different women. There was another wardrobe next to it. 'Clothes for her and the Ice Queen, good name, felt like I was talking to The Grand Matriarch, who has the other wardrobe?' She wondered.</p><p>"The other one has Tatewaki's clothes." Kimi commented. "I saw you looking at it." She said.</p><p>"You concubine?" Ting Li said in disbelief."Not think Ice Queen weak like that."</p><p>Kimi laughed. "Not exactly girlfriend." She replied. "And weak is a word that is never associated with Nabs." She added sternly. "She's not sharing me with Tatewaki, We share her. Get it?" Kimi tossed a blouse and slacks to Ting Li. "These should fit." Kimi closed the wardrobe and sat on the bed. Kimi looked at the elegantly made up bed. "Sometimes it's Tatewaki who sleeps alone." She gave Ting Li a cold look. "A piece of advice, Nabs is the toughest woman you, or anyone, will ever meet. Remember that."</p><p>Ting Li bowed in apology. "I sorry." She said contritely. She looked at Kimi. "She really Tong Leader?"</p><p>"Oh yeah." Kimi said in emphasis. "So far two families have pledged themselves to her." She waved her hand. "three, if you count Tatewaki."</p><p>Ting Li finished buttoning her blouse. She walked over to a mirror. "Not bad." She said admiring her reflection. "She have good taste." Ting Li turned around. "I hear Cologne and her disciples run biggest Tong in Tokyo."</p><p>"For now." Kimi said seriously. She stood. "Well you're dressed and you haven't tried anything." Kimi said matter-of-factly. "And so far you've been pretty open." She nodded toward the door. "And if you're telling the truth about your mission, then I think we can do business."</p><p>"Business?" Ting Li asked.</p><p>Kimi nodded. "If you're telling the truth then you're going to need help. We can provide the help. Convince us."</p><p>A slow smile appeared on Ting Li's face then she bowed. "I sorry again." She said as she arose. "For thinking you just pretty face." Kimi's face dimpled in a grin. Ting Li shook her head and bowed again. 'Aiyah, if Ice Queen is what her,' she looked at Kimi, 'Lieutenant says; then I'd better start talking fast.' She thought. 'Especially if the reports we have are true.' She looked at Kimi. "Find pouch." She said. "It tell you everything."</p><p>"Oh we're looking." Kimi said easily. "That's not what I meant. I meant; convince us to support you. Ting Li."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The pirate leader was awakened in his cell by a bucket of cold water. Before he could react he was grabbed and dragged to his feet. A gag was shoved into his mouth and tied behind his head. The pirate's arms were bound tightly behind him. He was roughly shoved out of the cell and prodded up the stairs. The pirate blinked in the bright afternoon sunshine. A prod from the point of a sword got him moving again. The rest of his men were already there and kneeling on the deck. Like him they were bound. The pirate was dragged forward and forced to kneel. Directly in front of him was a woman seated under an umbrella. She wore a black changsom Large sunglasses shaded her eyes. Standing just to her right was the tall swordsman. To her left a tall blonde in a dress that echoed Nabiki's.<p>"This is the last one My Lord." Said the crewman. This was his first cruise. He expected a spoiled rich boy. He got a warrior instead. Crewman Ito stood just a bit straighter. A bit prouder.</p><p>Tatewaki nodded gravely and turned his back on the captive pirate. "We are ready to proceed." Tatewaki rumbled. "At your command."</p><p>Nabiki stared at the kneeling men. Nabiki forced her face to remain expressionless. She had read the reports Tatewaki's men had made. Drugs, weapons, those were expected. The Doctor's report on the still nameless young woman was a litany of horror. She had been raped repeatedly, that Nabiki had expected but she had been beaten also repeatedly. The young woman's jaw was broken in two places and that was the least of her injuries. Nabiki had called for a helicopter and had the young woman flown to the mainland. Nabiki had walked alongside as the pale woman was carried to the helicopter. Nabiki didn't think she'd ever forget the woman's face. Nabiki nodded to Tatewaki.</p><p>Tatewaki turned to face the pirates. "You style yourselves pirates." Tatewaki said without preamble. "So be it. A pirate deserves a pirate's death." Tatewaki nodded toward Crewman Ito. The young man walked over to the side of the yacht and removed a section. "However the Ice Queen has decided to give all of you a chance, a slim chance, for survival." Crewman Ito walked over to one of the bound pirates and dragged him to the opening. He cut the pirates bonds and pushed him overboard. Tatewaki dragged the pirate captain to his feet and pulled off his gag. "You have a complaint?" He asked dangerously.</p><p>"It's nearly ten kilometers to the nearest shore." Screamed the pirate captain. "We'll never make it." Splashes punctuated the pirate's scream.</p><p>Nabiki leaned forward. "I calculate a nearly even chance one of you will make it." She said coldly. "If it happens that it is you that survives I suggest I never hear of it." Nabiki leaned back in her chair. "Good bye Captain."</p><p>Tatewaki dragged the pirate to the opening and held the blade of his sword against the pirates neck as his bonds were cut. Tatewaki kicked the man into the sea.</p><p>As the pirate surfaced sputtering he noticed a orange haired figure waving to him from the deck.</p><p>"Hey captain." Chirped Ting Li. "I have present for you." She threw something with unerring accuracy. The object hit him in the face. The water balloon burst and covered the pirate's head with a sticky substance. The pirate's eyes widened in terror as he recognized the taste and smell of blood. He started swimming madly away.</p><p>Nabiki kept her face expressionless as she walked to her cabin. Tatewaki and Kimi trailed protectively behind her. As she walked each crewman she passed bowed deeply in respect. Nabiki reached the cabin, opened the door and walked in, Kimi and Tatewaki followed. The moment the door shut a low moan erupted from Nabiki's throat and she raced away. Retching sounds came from the small bathroom.</p><p>"Stay with her Kimi. I need to speak to the Captain." Tatewaki walked out of the stateroom and flagged a passing crewman. "Guard this door and let none but I enter." He ordered the crewman. The crewman bowed and took up a position in front of the door. Tatewaki strode away. Though he did not hurry he quickly reached the bridge.</p><p>"Milord." Captain Osigi said in greeting.</p><p>"Captain." Tatewaki walked to stand next to the Captain.</p><p>"How is the Lady Tendo?" The Captain asked in concern. "She tried not to show it but," The captain broke off. "Forgive me, I exceed my position."</p><p>Tatewaki waved off the Captain's apology. "Not at all." Tatewaki replied. "I am gratified you are concerned." Tatewaki looked out of the window and watched the sea for a moment. "It costs her." He said quietly. The two men watched the swelling sea. "The men?" Tatewaki asked after a long pause. "What is their mood?</p><p>Captain Osigi smiled slightly. "Good Milord." He replied.</p><p>"Indeed?" Tatewaki said. "Even after what just occurred?"</p><p>"Yes Milord." The Captain said firmly. "If I may speak frankly?" Tatewaki nodded the Captain to continue. "The men, and that includes myself, don't know where this is going but they, and that definitely includes myself, want to be a part of it." He looked out the window of the bridge toward where the pirate's vessel was plowing through the sea alongside the yacht. The yacht's lieutenant piloting the second ship. "Having an anonymous and armed vessel could be useful." He said in a thoughtful tone.</p><p>"Aye." Tatewaki rumbled. "The thought had crossed my mind but I dared not suggest it." He looked at the Captain. "Not until I was sure of your loyalties." Tatewaki nodded respectfully. "We crossed a line Captain and there is no turning back."</p><p>"No." Agreed the Captain. "There isn't." Captain Osigi smiled in anticipation.</p><p>"If what we do is discovered we may be branded criminals." Tatewaki said seriously. "Or worse."</p><p>"That is understood Milord." The Captain said calmly. "There is a saying I learned in school, I don't remember who said it, but it went something like; 'For evil to win only requires that good men do nothing'. I am tired of doing nothing Milord."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kimi tapped on the bathroom door. "Nabs?" Kimi called softly. "Can I come in?" Kimi took the choked grunt that came from the bathroom as a yes and opened the door. Nabiki was standing over the sink and washing her face. Kimi could see Nabiki's eyes were red but that the younger woman seemed to be in control of herself.<p>Nabiki looked at her reflection in the mirror. "Did I do the right thing?" She asked her reflection. She turned to look dismally at Kimi. "I. I."</p><p>Kimi rushed over and wrapped Nabiki in her arms. "Yes you did." She said firmly. "Ting Li was right and you know it. They'd never have paid for what they did to that girl." She said. "Not enough." Kimi growled fiercely. "Wasn't that why you asked to have all the prostitutes under your protection? Because you know, like I know, that no one cares what happens to them." Kimi took a breath to calm herself. "You know they were going to kill her eventually. You know she wasn't the first one either. You know that." Kimi's arms tightened around Nabiki. "You care."</p><p>"I did it for street cred." Nabiki mumbled. "That's all."</p><p>Kimi snorted. "Tell that to someone who didn't listen to you throw up for the past twenty minutes." Kimi rested her cheek on Nabiki's head. "Let them think that." She declared quietly. "I'll always know the truth." She said. "Tatewaki will always know." Kimi felt Nabiki's body straighten and she let go of her. Nabiki sat up.</p><p>"I need to wash my face again." Nabiki said in a slightly hoarse tone.</p><p>"What you need." Kimi said firmly. "Is a hot bath and a nap." She folded her arms across her chest. "And I'm not taking 'no' for an answer." Kimi stood and pulled Nabiki to her feet. "You can be the Ice Queen for everyone else; but you're always going to be Nabs to me. Okay baby?"</p><p>Nabiki looked into Kimi's eyes for a moment then she nodded. "Okay baby."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ting Li approached the door to the main cabin. The yacht was anchored just off a beach in a secluded bay. The pirate's vessel was to be hidden here until further arrangements could be made. This beach was less than a mile from a main road and a car had been sent for to transport all the non-crew members back home. The car was not due to arrive for another hour or so and Ting Li felt this was her best opportunity to get into the Ice Queen's good graces. 'That was a decision worthy of an Amazon Council.' She thought in true admiration. 'Aiyah with a woman like that on my side,' Ting Li let the thought go unfinished as she reached the door and the crewman guarding it. "Ting Li requests permission to speak to the Most Honorable Ice Queen." She said with a short bow.<p>"Sorry ma'am but I'm under orders not to let anyone see the Lady Tendo." The crewman replied.</p><p>"Then please let me speak to her aide Kimi Ota." Ting Li countered quickly, already expecting this. "Surely she can decide."</p><p>The crewman thought about it for a moment then turned and pressed a button on an intercom. "Sorry to disturb you Ms. Ota." He said recognizing the answering voice. "But Ting Li would like to speak to the Lady Tendo. She requested that you decide."</p><p>The door to the cabin opened and Kimi walked out. "Ready to make your pitch?" Kimi asked cooly.</p><p>Ting Li let a grudging smile come to her lips. "Yes Kimi Ota." Ting Li replied seriously. "I hope convince Ice Queen to support me as you suggested." She said in a carefully rehearsed speech. She looked Kimi in the eyes. "I just hope she think I and task are worthy."</p><p>Kimi gave Ting Li an evaluating glance then nodded. "Wait here. I'll talk to Nabiki." Kimi reentered the cabin and closed the door. The door opened a minute later and Kimi waved in the orange haired Amazon. "You have ten minutes." Kimi informed Ting Li. "Make them count."</p><p>"I want thank you." Ting Li said seriously. "You willing give me chance."</p><p>"Let's just say I like tough women." Kimi replied in answer. She turned as Nabiki, wrapped in a fluffy white robe came out of the adjoining bedroom. "You're looking better." Kimi said to Nabiki. "Drink?"</p><p>"Small one." Nabiki replied. "Good afternoon Ting Li."</p><p>"Good Afternoon Honorable Ice Queen." Ting Li replied slowly, carefully enunciating each word. "I want to thank you for granting me this audience."</p><p>Nabiki nodded slightly. She reached out her hand as Kimi walked over with her drink. Nabiki took the glass and sipped. "You say you're here to bring back Cologne and Shampoo." Nabiki stated. Ting Li nodded in confirmation. "As much as I'd like that to happen, I'd also like to know it was permanent."</p><p>"That may be difficult Honored Ice Queen." Ting Li replied honestly. "Cologne is very powerful, great influence. Still, she must accept summons if I present it to her."</p><p>"Or kill you and claim she never received it." Kimi added from her seat. "You did think of that, didn't you?"</p><p>Ting Li shook her head. "She amazon, she never do that."</p><p>"She probably won't Kimi." Nabiki said seriously. "So Cologne will probably, at the very least, accept the summons, then what?" Nabiki took another sip of her drink. "I doubt she's in the mood to leave right now."</p><p>"Council consider that." Ting Li informed Nabiki, earning her a nod of approval from the Ice Queen. "If Cologne and Shampoo not want return home I do best to convince them." She smiled slightly as she fisted one hand and rubbed the knuckles with the other. "Shampoo pretty good. I pretty good too." She bowed to Nabiki. "Council worried want hear report directly from Cologne's mouth. May want stop. But Council also think presence in Japans good thing too." She shrugged apologetically. "Would you not think same?"</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "I would." She agreed. "I can understand your need and I sympathize but Cologne must stop backing Hikaru Nakamura." Nabiki looked down at her drink. "That's my price for helping you."</p><p>Ting Li almost rocked back on her heels by Nabiki's unexpected statement. Both for the price and the offer to help. Ting Li licked her lips. "Having ties to Japanese Tong very useful." She said slowly. 'Gods I hope she'll accept an alliance.' She thought excitedly as she fought to keep her expression under control.</p><p>Nabiki looked up. "No drugs. No guns. The rest is negotiable. Take it or leave it." Nabiki said brusquely. "And I decide what's negotiable."</p><p>"Council make final decision." Ting Li said seriously. "And drugs most profitable." She said to test Nabiki's resolve.</p><p>"No drugs. Period." Nabiki said coldly. "Don't confuse me with Nakamura." Nabiki continued. "Money is only part of my interest. A big part, I admit, but there are some things that are unacceptable. At least for Japan."</p><p>"For Japan not for you?" Ting Li asked. The look on the Ice Queen's face showed that what was unacceptable for Japan was just as unacceptable to her. "I see." Ting Li spread her hands helplessly. "I not in position to speak for council." She raised a hand. "But I can speak for Ting Li." She said earnestly. "It would be honor if you accept me as ally. No, not ally, vassal." Ting Li knelt down on one knee. "I owe you my life, for that alone, I would pledge me to you but then I see you leader." Ting Li waved a hand to encompass the ship and beyond. "Think maybe hard fight coming up." Ting Li cracked her knuckles. "Think maybe you may allow me fight with you. Think maybe even if lose this right side be on."</p><p>"I don't plan on losing." Nabiki said firmly. She looked at Ting Li in a way that made the orange haired Amazon feel like she had been weighed and measured down to the contents of her pockets. "You'll be fighting against your own." She told Ting Li.</p><p>"As will you." Countered Ting Li.</p><p>Nabiki smiled slightly. "Touche." She said. "Cologne is a Council Elder and Shampoo is a Joketsuzoku warrior."</p><p>"True but if you win Council be happy Joketsuzoku Warrior there too." Ting Li pointed out. "Besides I always want to try Shampoo; in friendly fight." She smiled. "Problem with friendly fight, you not know who really best."</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "You sound like Ranma." She downed the remains of her drink.</p><p>"Ten minutes." Said Kimi. She smiled at Ting Li. "I think you made them count."</p><p>"Excuse me Ice Queen." Ting Li said in sudden hesitation. "Ranma?" She said in a slightly choked voice. "That not Ranma Saotome, no?</p><p>"The one and the same." Nabiki replied. "Why? Problem?"</p><p>Ting Li waved her hands frantically. "No. No. No problem." She swallowed. "Saw him once." Ting Li seemed to vibrate slightly. "I very much like see again."</p><p>Kimi laughed. "Someone's got the hots for Ranma."</p><p>Ting Li waved her hands some more. "No. No. No." She said hurriedly. "That not it." She sighed. "Want test myself against him. He best I ever see."</p><p>"That can be arranged." Nabiki said with a wry smile. She nodded firmly. "Okay Ting Li I'm going to give you a chance."</p><p>Ting Li bowed. "Thank you Honored Ice Queen." She said sincerely.</p><p>End Chapter 6</p><p>Author's Notes: You know I have to laugh. There have been a number of reviewers who've expressed concern over the level of sexual content in Queen Rat. While it is true that there is a goodly amount of sex involved in QR, there is also a significant level of violence and no one seems to complain about that. So typically American. Sex bad, violence good. Or at least acceptable.</p><p>A couple points. First off this is Ranma. It was originally created as a SEX comedy. Secondly, the rating is T. While I will not post explicitly sexual chapters I think I'm keeping it within the bounds of what is acceptable for teenagers.</p><p>Sarge climbs up on his soapbox. Damn but I haven't ranted in awhile.</p><p>How in hell did our society get so skewed out of balance that violence or nearly any sort is allowed, even encouraged for teen and pre-teen viewers? Yet, even a hint of cleavage elicits howls of protest from the so-called moral right. Since when did sex between consenting adults become a greater evil then war? Last I heard no one ever consented to be the victim of 'collateral damage' in any armed conflict. This is not to say that sometimes war isn't justified but for pity sake, war is supposed to be the last resort.</p><p>I know I am preaching to the choir but I'm going to say this once and only once. If you think that sex, any sex, between consenting adults is a greater sin than violence, hatred and war, then as far as I'm concerned you are insane.</p><p>Just had to get that off my chest.</p><p>Sarge</p>
