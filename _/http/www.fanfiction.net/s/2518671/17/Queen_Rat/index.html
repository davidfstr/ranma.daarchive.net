</div><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Training Days</p><p>This takes place between getting out of prison and Akane and Ranma working as strippers.</p><p>A Queen Rat side story - Part 1</p><p>"Okay what have we got?' Asked Lt. Chikato Noriudo. He looked at the three other people at the table. He pointed to one.</p><p>"They're all very strong, athletic and highly skilled." The man replied. "Ms. Tendo is highly intelligent and has some notable acting ability." The man looked at a folder. "Mr. Saotome is also, despite his lazy speech, very intelligent. It's his ability to shift sex that presents some interesting opportunities."</p><p>"Tell me something I don't know." The lieutenant replied. He pointed to the lone woman in the group. "Doctor? Their psych profile."</p><p>The woman pursed her lips. "Mr. Saotome's sex changing is problematic." She said. She looked at the first man. "He exhibits some aspects of multiple personality disorder." She explained. "There are noticeable differences in his pysch evaluations between his male and female versions. He's also probably a latent homosexual or at least bisexual. Considering his curse, I'd be more surprised if he wasn't." She shrugged. "Then again so is Ms. Tendo." She pulled at her earlobe. "Probably why they are a couple." The woman looked at her folder. "They both have a highly structured, though somewhat flexible, ethical code." She pursed her lips again. "They both are highly extroverted, though Ms. Tendo is exhibiting some symptoms of depression." She looked at Noriudo. "The girl is angry both at herself and the world around her."</p><p>Lt. Noriudo nodded. "It's been that way for a long time. Go on."</p><p>"The Kuonji girl is virtually a cross between the two of them." The woman continued. "Just as intelligent and nearly as skilled as the other two, more skilled in some things, plus she's gender confused and an accomplished transvestite. Her psych profile is remarkably similar to both Mr. Saotome and Ms. Tendo."</p><p>"Suggestions." Lt. Noriudo demanded.</p><p>"We can't place them in a normal working environment." She said decisively. "We can't put them where they're most suited, that being as martial arts or athletic instructors, but an office is out of the question."</p><p>"Besides," Interrupted the third person. A thin, intense looking man. "The idea is to place them where they have freedom to be at work or not, allows them to use their skills in an unremarkable manner and, most importantly, someplace where they have some contact with the element they need to associate with." He leaned back in his chair. "Add to that the need for them and Ms. Kuonji to be together at all times." He tented his fingers in front of him. "I agree with Dr. Takahashi, an office is out of the question."</p><p>"A restaurant?" Dr. Takahashi suggested. "They all have experience." Then she shook her head. "No. That would increase their chances of being recognized."</p><p>"I agree." The thin, intense man replied. He opened his folder and extracted a picture. He tossed it on the table. "This is what I think they should be doing."</p><p>Lt. Noriudo picked up the picture. It was a cheesecake photo of both Akane and Ranma. One of the ones Nabiki used to sell at sporting events. "Explain." Ordered the lieutenant.</p><p>The man smiled.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"You want us to do what?" Akane almost screamed. "What kinds of perverts are running the Police department?"<p>"I dunno Tomboy." Ranma said with a sly grin. "It's got potential."</p><p>Akane looked at Ranma in disbelief. "You're not serious?" She squeaked.</p><p>"Sure; think about it Tomboy." Ranma replied. "We get to make our own hours. The money ain't bad and you gotta admit, no one would expect to find either one of us in one of those places."</p><p>"He wants us to become strippers, Ranma." Akane exclaimed angrily. "You know, as in taking our clothes off for money."</p><p>"Sounds like fun." Ranma grinned.</p><p>"Ranma." Akane growled.</p><p>"You're just chicken." Ranma interrupted.</p><p>"What?" Akane's eye's widened in shock. "Take that back."</p><p>"Bwarrrk." Ranma placed his hands in his armpits and waggled his arms. "Bwarrk." He repeated. Ranma laughed. "Maybe you're right; you'd have to learn to dance too." He shook his head. "What was I thinking, the Tomboy is too clumsy to dance, let alone be sexy."</p><p>"I can too dance." Akane retorted hotly. "And I can too be sexy."</p><p>"Not like me." Ranma shot back with an almost evil grin. "Maybe we should wait for Ukyo to get better. I bet she would do it." Ranma's grin got wider.</p><p>"Actually we were planning on Ms. Kuonji pretending to be a man." Lt. Noriudo interjected. "She's very good at it."</p><p>"Hey Uk-chan is cute." Ranma smiled. "No matter how she dresses. She could pull it off." Ranma jerked a thumb at Akane. "The Tomboy can play a guy pretty good." He turned to Akane. "Right Romeo?"</p><p>"Oooh." Growled Akane. She took a breath. 'I will not let him pick a fight with me. I will not let him pick a fight with me.' She repeated in her head. 'He's challenging me to do this.' She realized. 'I can't believe he'd want to humiliate me like that.' Suddenly Akane's breath caught in her throat. 'Yes I can.' Akane sighed. "Is this what you want to do Ranma?" She asked.</p><p>Ranma tilted his head. He gave Akane an appraising look. "Yeah." He said finally. "Let's give it a shot."</p><p>Akane nodded. "Whatever you want Ranma." She said quietly. She looked at Noriudo. "Okay Lieutenant, we'll try your idea."</p><p>Lt. Noriudo slapped his hands on his thighs. "Excellent." He said in satisfaction. "Your training starts tomorrow.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Where are we going?" Ranma asked from the back of the van. She was in female form and wearing a green leotard and a pair of shorts. She was wearing sneakers. Akane sat next to her wearing a similar outfit.<p>"Dance class." Lt. Noriudo replied. "The teacher's name is Gigi." He smiled. "Just Gigi." Lt. Noriudo scratched the side of his face. "She'll work with both of you to develop a routine."</p><p>The van pulled up to the side of a small building. It was a two story building sandwiched between two warehouses. It was recessed from the street by a paved yard. A chain link fence with a gate fronted the building. Lt. Noriudo got out of the van and hurried Ranma and Akane over to the gate. There was a number pad. Noriudo punched in a number and the gate opened automatically. The entered the small compound and walked quickly to the door of the building. A woman stood in the open doorway.</p><p>She was an attractive woman in her mid forties. She was of mid height, slim and athletic. She also was wearing a leotard plus she had wool leggings that were pushed down to her calves. She had a broad smile on her face as they approached. Ranma and Akane both instantly liked her. "Hi Gigi." Noriudo called.</p><p>"Hey Chikato." Gigi replied. "So these are my two new students." She stepped back and waved everyone in. "Well come in."</p><p>"I'll be going." Said Lt. Chikato. "Someone will be by around one with lunch and I'll pick you up and take you back to the safe house at four."</p><p>Akane and Ranma looked around curiously. The building was obviously a converted warehouse. Steel beams and vents stretched above them. The interior walls, where there were walls, were freestanding and rose only two thirds of the way to the ceiling above. Giving the space an open and somewhat unfinished look. "It's like walking through a maze." Akane whispered to Ranma. Gigi led them to a large space marked off by one such freestanding wall. A large mirror filled one wall.</p><p>"This is the dance studio." Gigi supplied. The far end of the space had a raised stage about twelve feet wide and six feet deep. A steel pole stood at the very center of the stage. She pointed to the center of the studio. "Stand there." Gigi walked around Ranma and Akane. She stopped in front of them. Gigi looked at Akane. "You're a bit muscular." She said critically. "But a lot of men like athletic women." She tapped her upper lip. "We'll need to find a way to soften your look a little." She looked at Ranma. "Are those real?" She asked.</p><p>Ranma snorted. "Oh yeah." She said. "Wanna see for yourself?" She asked.</p><p>Gigi nodded. "Actually yes." She replied. "But right now I'll take your word for it." Gigi paced back and forth between Ranma and Akane. "I want to see how flexible you both are." Gigi arched backwards until her hands touched the floor. "Can you do this?" She asked. Gigi pulled herself into a hand stand, held it, and then brought her feet to the floor. She eyes widened when both Ranma and Akane were repeating her entire sequence, over and over, in place. "Stop." She commanded. "Do this." Gigi lifted one leg and then slowly extended it upwards. She pulled her leg toward her until her knee touched her head. She lowered her leg.</p><p>Akane looked at Ranma. She shrugged. Akane repeated Gigi's move easily. Akane smiled smugly at Ranma's gulp. "Like that?" She asked Gigi.</p><p>"Do it again." Commanded Gigi. "Only do it slower." Akane nodded and repeated the leg lift. "Better." She looked at Ranma. "Now you." Gigi said. Ranma repeated the move slowly. "Okay you're flexible but can you dance?"</p><p>"What do you mean?" Ranma asked. Akane nodded.</p><p>"Dance." Gigi waved her hands. "Haven't you guys gone to a night club?" She rolled her eyes when both Ranma and Akane shook their heads. "Hold on." Gigi walked over to a table. She rifled through a number of CDs selected one and placed it into the player. A slow sensual samba beat filled the room. "Girl from Ipanema." Gigi said. "My favorite song." She walked back to Ranma and Akane. "Look in the mirror." She commanded. "Let's warm up." Gigi started moving to the beat. Her hips rocked to the right, then to the left, then back again. "Do what I do." She commanded. "To the beat. Right and left, right and left."</p><p>Akane looked over to Ranma. She was busy rocking her hips back and forth. 'Okay if Ranma can do this I can do this.' She thought. She moved her hips. 'Hey this is easy.'</p><p>Two hours later Akane was drenched in sweat. "The woman is a monster." Akane panted to Ranma. "Even your workouts aren't this bad." The music playing in the background was now more driving. Gigi could be seen near the mirror looking almost fresh by comparison. There was a huge grin on the woman's face.</p><p>Ranma had her hands on her knees. She nodded. "Yeah, great isn't it?" Ranma took a swig of water from a bottle and handed the bottle to Akane. "You're doin pretty good." She said.</p><p>"Thanks Ranma." Akane smiled slightly. "So are you." Ranma smiled back. "You really want to do this Ranma?" She asked. Ranma nodded. Akane nodded back. "Okay Ranma. Whatever you want." She said. She stood. "I'm going to practice that last set of moves." She walked to the center of the room.</p><p>Ranma watched her go. "Whatever I want." She said quietly. "Let's see if you really mean it."</p><p>Practice was interrupted by lunch as promised and, as promised, Lt. Noriudo returned at four to take them to the safe house. The safe house was a small apartment Ranma and Akane had been given a couple days before. It had two bedrooms; one slightly larger than the other, a small kitchen/dining area, a living room and a single bathroom and separate shower. When Ukyo arrived they'd move into a larger apartment. Right now Ranma slept in the larger of the two rooms. Akane in the other.</p><p>Much as Akane wished to sleep in the same room, the same bed, as Ranma, she couldn't. Ranma had gotten a little distant from her ever since they moved out of the Tendo house and had made it clear he wanted his own room. Ranma was civil, even friendly but seemed unwilling to initiate any intimacy. 'Not that I blame him.' Akane thought to herself. She looked at the blank walls of the bedroom. "How can I make it up to you?' She said quietly. "Why am I even trying?" She said sadly. There was a knock on her bedroom door. "Yes?" She asked.</p><p>"Can I come in?" Came Ranma's voice.</p><p>Akane tried to keep the eagerness from her voice. "Sure Ranma, come on in." Ranma, in male form, opened the door. "Hey." She said when Ranma walked in dressed only in his boxers. "Do you need something?' She asked.</p><p>"I think I pulled a muscle or something." Ranma began when Akane rushed over and pulled him gently to the bed.</p><p>"Lie down." She said. "I'll massage it." Ranma lay down on his stomach. "Where does it hurt?" Akane asked. Ranma pointed to his lower back. Akane placed her hand gently over where Ranma pointed. She probed gently. "Here?" She asked. "Lower." Ranma said into the mattress. Akane shifted her hands down. "Right there." Said Ranma. Akane nodded and began to gently massage the area. Her hands began to take on a gentle glow. "Tell me if it gets too warm." Akane said as she massaged the area.</p><p>"Feels good." Ranma crossed his arms and rested his head on them. "You worked real hard today." He said after a moment.</p><p>"Thank you Ranma." Akane replied quietly as she massaged.</p><p>"You really gonna do it?" Ranma asked. "The stripping, I mean."</p><p>"If that's what you want Ranma." Akane said in the same tone.</p><p>"It's what I want Tomboy." Ranma replied. "My back feels better now." Ranma said. "You can stop." Akane pulled her hands away and Ranma stood up. "Thanks Tomboy." He said. "I'll see ya in the morning." He started walking to the bedroom door.</p><p>"Ranma wait." Akane cried. "Please." She added quickly.</p><p>Ranma turned around. "Tomboy?"</p><p>"W-wouldn't you l-like to stay here tonight?' Akane stammered.</p><p>"Not tonight Tomboy." Ranma replied coolly.</p><p>Akane looked down and nodded. "O-okay Ranma." She said sadly. She didn't look up until the door closed. Akane threw herself to the futon. The self hate that she had carefully bottled up came to the fore. "Stupid, stupid Akane." She whispered into her pillow. "The best thing that ever happened to you and you ruin it. Stupid, stupid, stupid." She sobbed. Akane rolled over and pressed the pillow against her face. "Ranma." She wailed into the pillow.</p><p>Ranma lay down in the large bed in his room. His ears picked up the faint sounds of Akane's sobs. "It hurts doesn't it Tomboy?' He said aloud. "Did you think I'd just forgive you?" Ranma rolled over and pillowed his head on one arm. "And Ukyo." He rolled over on to his back. "She knows Akane can't control her temper." Ranma rolled over again. The faint sounds of Akane's sobs again came to his ears. "Oh who am I kidding?' He grumbled. Ranma got up and walked out of the bedroom and over to Akane's room. He opened the door.</p><p>Akane looked up with a tear streaked face as the door opened. "Ranma?" Ranma didn't say anything; he just walked over to the futon and lifted Akane into his arms. Again without saying a word he carried her back to the larger bedroom and laid her gently on the bed.</p><p>"Get some sleep." Ranma said gruffly as he got into the bed. "We have a busy day tomorrow." He rolled over and turned his back on Akane.</p><p>Akane looked at Ranma's back. She wiped her face "Yes Ranma." She said miserably. Her arm reached out to Ranma and stopped. 'No.' She told herself. 'I can't. Not now.' Akane closed her eyes and spent the night in a fitful sleep.</p><p>The next week was pretty much the same. Akane and Ranma would wake up, eat and wait for the van to take them to their dance classes. During class Ranma was alive, funny and out going. Things were different in the apartment. Every evening Ranma would barely speak to Akane. Though he did let her sleep in the same bed. Every night Akane would wait for Ranma to fall asleep before she cried herself to her own restless sleep.</p><p>The following weekend was a day off for the two of them. Ranma had gone out for an early morning jog, leaving Akane to her own devices. Akane was in the kitchen making herself a cup of tea when her eyes fell on the knife rack. She reached over and pulled out a slim sharp knife that she used to bone chicken. Actually Ranma used it to bone chicken; her efforts were a lot less effective. Akane lifted the boning knife and held it in front of her face and looked at it for a long time. The sound of footsteps approaching the kitchen door made her hurriedly replace the knife. Akane took a deep breath and turned around. "Hi Ranma." She said cheerfully as the door opened. "How was your run?"</p><p>"Pretty good Tomboy, it was kinda peaceful; you know?" Ranma replied. "Maybe you could come next time." He walked into the kitchen and sat down.</p><p>Akane's mouth worked soundlessly for a moment. "I-I'd like that Ranma." Akane replied. Akane sat down at the table. She sipped her tea. Akane grimaced at the tea being cold. "W-would you like some tea Ranma?" Ranma nodded. Akane got up and picked up Ranma's mug from the dish rack and carried it over to the stove. Akane poured out her cold tea and filled both mugs with hot tea. Akane brought the tea back to the table. When she put Ranma's mug down on the table a little tea sloshed over the side.</p><p>"You okay Tomboy?' Ranma asked.</p><p>Akane sat down and stared at her tea cup. "Just surprised, that's all." She looked up. "We haven't run together in awhile." She looked down again. "I'd like that."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Okay tomorrow then." Ranma stretched. "Right now, I need a shower." Ranma finished his tea and stood. He stretched. "A whole day off." He said happily. "What do ya wanna do today?"</p><p>Akane swallowed. "Whatever you want Ranma." Akane replied.</p><p>"Yeah?" Ranma looked at Akane. "How bout we stay in and watch television."</p><p>Akane smiled briefly. "Sounds like fun." She said sincerely.</p><p>"Think you can make some popcorn without burning the place down, Tomboy?' Ranma asked.</p><p>Akane's smile widened slightly. "Just take your shower." She growled. Ranma walked off laughing. Akane watched him go. 'He was being nice.' She realized. Akane stood up, collected the cups and brought them to the sink. She was about to rinse the cups when she realized Ranma was in the shower. "Don't ruin it Akane." She told herself sternly. She left them in the sink and walked over to a cabinet and pulled out a popcorn maker. She looked at the popcorn maker. "It's just a popcorn machine, Akane." She looked at it some more.</p><p>Akane left the kitchen and walked over to the bathroom door. She heard the water going. Akane knocked anyway. "Ranma?" She called. She heard a muffled response and opened the door. Ranma was in the shower. She could just see his blurry outline through the rippled glass door. "Ranma." She called again.</p><p>"What is it Tomboy?" Ranma said over the sound of the water. He slid the glass door open and stuck his head out. "Problem?"</p><p>Akane looked down. "About the popcorn." She began. "Could you make it?" She said in a little voice.</p><p>Ranma rolled his eyes. "Figures." He growled. "Well if you're not gonna make the popcorn you think you can wash my back?"</p><p>Akane looked up. "Really?" She squeaked. "S-sure." Akane looked around. "Be right back." Akane raced to her bedroom, removed her clothes, threw a robe over herself and walked quickly back into the bathroom. The glass door was closed but she could still make out Ranma's form. Swallowing nervously, Akane removed her robe and walked to the shower. "I'm coming in." She called. Akane opened the door. 'Gods, he's gorgeous.' She said to herself. She got into the shower behind Ranma. Akane reached passed Ranma and grabbed a wash cloth. She soaped it up and started washing Ranma's back. Admiring the dense musculature as she did so. 'He's being nice.' She thought again. On impulse Akane wrapped her arms around Ranma's waist and pressed against his back.</p><p>Ranma turned off the water. "Akane?" He said quietly.</p><p>"Yes Ranma?" Akane replied without letting go.</p><p>"I'm not promising you anything." He said in the same quiet voice. "But I don't want to fight anymore."</p><p>"I know Ranma." Akane briefly tightened her embrace. "I don't want to fight anymore either."</p><p>Ranma turned in Akane's arms and wrapped his own arms around her. "Ukyo's going to be living here soon. I don't want you to fight with her either."</p><p>Akane nodded against Ranma's chest. "I won't Ranma."</p><p>Ranma looked down. "I'm gonna hold ya to that." He rumbled. Ranma rested his chin lightly on top of Akane's head. They stood like that in the small shower for a long time. Finally Ranma sighed and released his embrace. "Let's dry off and watch some TV." He said in almost regretful tones.</p><p>They left the shower and returned to their respective bedrooms. Akane hummed to herself as she looked through her clothes to decide on what to wear. The bedroom door opened and Ranma walked in. He was wearing a pair of loose draw-string pants and a light robe. "I started the popcorn." He said. He looked at Akane. "Just put on a t-shirt of something." He said. "We're not going out."</p><p>'Oh gods.' Akane thought to herself. 'The last time he looked at me like that we,' Akane nodded rapidly. "Sure. T-shirt. Great idea." She reached into a drawer and pulled out a oversized t-shirt without looking at it. She pulled it on hurriedly. "Ready." She said brightly.</p><p>Ranma turned and left the bedroom, Akane followed quickly. The popcorn was done and they soon found themselves on the couch. Akane leaned against Ranma as they ate the popcorn while Ranma flipped through the channels. "Movie. Movie. Game show. Ah sumo wrestling." Ranma tossed the remote to the side. He raised his arm and wrapped it around Akane's shoulders. She sighed in contentment.</p><p>Akane watched Ranma's profile as he watched the matches. 'He's being nice.' She thought again. "Ranma?" She said quietly.</p><p>"Hmm?" Ranma replied without taking his eyes off the TV.</p><p>"Never mind." Akane replied. Akane reached out and traced the muscles of Ranma's chest where it was exposed by his open robe. 'I don't deserve you Ranma.' She thought to herself. Akane leaned her head against Ranma's chest. 'Ukyo would be better than me. Anybody would be better than me.' Akane sighed when she felt Ranma's hand stroking her short hair. 'But until then,' Akane closed her eyes when Ranma started to play with her earlobe. 'Gods I want him so bad.' She turned her head and kissed his chest. Her hand began to move toward Ranma's crotch when her hand was intercepted.</p><p>"Ask Tomboy." Ranma said quietly.</p><p>"Ranma?" Akane asked in a confused tone.</p><p>"Ask." He repeated. "Ya gotta ask."</p><p>"D-don't you want t-to?" Akane stammered. "I-I thought."</p><p>"I want to Tomboy." Ranma replied. "It's just," Ranma shrugged slightly. "You didn't ask." Ranma paused for a moment. "That night." Ranma leaned his head back against the couch. "I dunno." He breathed out. "I woulda done it Tomboy. I wanted to." Ranma said. "But ya didn't ask."</p><p>'No. I didn't' Akane thought. 'All I had to do,' Akane placed her hand on Ranma's chest. "Ranma?" She said quietly. "C-can I touch you?" She swallowed. "Can I touch you here?" She pressed her hands against his chest.</p><p>Ranma's mouth curved up in a half smile. "You touched before I said yes." Ranma replied. "Try again."</p><p>A smile grew slightly on Akane's face. "Oops." She said in a baby girl voice. "Can I touch your chest?' Akane giggled. "Please?"</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Yes you can." He replied cheerfully. Ranma closed his eyes as Akane gently rubbed his chest. "That's nice." He purred.</p><p>"Ranma?" Akane said in the same baby girl voice. "Can I touch," Akane drew out the word playfully. "Your stomach?' She said. Ranma told her to go ahead. Akane pressed her lips against Ranma's flat, muscular stomach.</p><p>"Hey that's not touching that's kissing." Ranma mock complained.</p><p>"Is too." Akane replied in the baby voice. "Oh all right. Can I kiss your stomach?"</p><p>"Go ahead." Ranma chuckled. He closed his eyes again. "Ranma?" He heard Akane say after a little while. "Hmm?" He mumbled.</p><p>"Ranma?" Akane repeated again. She licked her lips nervously. "I want, can I?" Akane swallowed. "I want to make you feel good."</p><p>"Say it Tomboy." Ranma said. "You know what I wanna hear."</p><p>'He's going to make me ask. He knows how much I like to do it. I never had to ask before. Gods he used to beg me to do it. And I know it's the one damn thing I do better than Ukyo ever could.' Akane hung her head. 'It's so embarrassing.' She told herself. 'Yeah, but you deserve it. Don't you?' Another voice in her head replied.</p><p>Lemon section. Email if you want it.</p><p>Akane woke from the short doze she had fallen into after they had finished making love. 'And it was making love.' Akane thought happily. Ranma's arm was wrapped around her waist. Akane gently lifted Ranma's arm and got quietly out of the bed. She padded to the bathroom and then into the kitchen to get a glass of water. Her eyes fell on the knife rack on the counter. She walked over and took out the boning knife. "You'll have to wait." She said to the knife. "I have some things to do first." She put the knife back in the rack and walked back into Ranma's bedroom.</p><p>Authors's Notes: Sorry for the delay in releasing this chapter of Queen Rat but I've been busy with Couch Trips. I also want to apologize if I haven't sent everyone any requested unabridged chapters. I get kind of distracted when I am working on a story so sometimes I forget. Regardless, if I forgot please send me an email. Oh, if you are requesting unabridged chapters for both Couch Trips and Queen Rat please give each request in a separate email.</p>
