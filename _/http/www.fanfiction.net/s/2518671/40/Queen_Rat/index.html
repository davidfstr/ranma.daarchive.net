</div><p>Chapter 2</p><p>'New Challenges'</p><p>Noriko Mata stared at the long stairway to the front door of the Kuno mansion. This wasn't the first time she had been there but this was the first time she was unsure of why she was there, Noriko started walking up the stairs carrying a small valise. 'Am I a guest or an employee?' She thought. 'And what's this task Ms. Kuno wants me to take?' It didn't occur to Noriko that she could have asked earlier or even refused but this was 'Ms Kuno' and one didn't ask. 'What is it about her?' She thought.</p><p>The door to the mansion opened and a liveried retainer raced out. "A million apologies." The man said. "I was unavoidably detained." He explained. "Please let me take your valise." He reached over and took the suitcase from Noriko. "A minor emergency." The man continued. "Unfortunately no one else was available."</p><p>Noriko started when he noticed that the man's uniform was torn. She licked her lips. "Is that blood?" She said in a weak voice. She pointed.</p><p>The man looked down. He grimaced. "That's going to come out of my salary." He grumbled. He sighed in discontent. "It's not even my blood." He complained. The man led her into the house. "Miss Kuno is delayed."</p><p>"Ms. Kuno." Noriko corrected irritably.</p><p>"Of couse." Agreed the man. "As I was saying My Lady is detained. She was in the middle of an experiement." He smiled. "My Lady does not like to leave things in the middle."</p><p>"No she does not." Noriko agreed firmly. "Noriko Mata." She bowed.</p><p>"Yoshi." The man introduced himself. "of the Kuno." He smiled proudly. "I am a Kuno family retainer Miss Mata, for all intents and purposes I am a Kuno." He continued walking and Noriko followed. "My Lady has given you the blue suite." Yoshi stopped at a door. "This is the Blue suite." He said and opened the door.</p><p>Noriko stopped open mouthed at the door ways. "My gods." She exclaimed. "It's as big as my whole apartment." She breathed. She looked around. "Where's the bed?"</p><p>Yoshi grinned. "This is just the sitting room." He explained. He walked to the far end of the room. Noriko hurried after. Yoshi pulled aside a curtain revealing another door. He opened it. "This," He said. "Is the bedroom."</p><p>"Oh. My. Gods." Noriko entered into room even larger than the outer one. Even the massive king sized heavy oak four poster bed against the wall seemed curiously shrunken. Noriko walked into the center of the room and stretched her arms out to her sides as far as they could go and spun in a slow circle. "I'm in heaven." She said giddily.</p><p>"I doubt that rather highly Miss Mata." Yoshi said in amusement. He looked at the valise in his hand and put it on the bed. "I don't suppose you have an evening gown in there?" He asked.</p><p>Noriko waved her hand down her chest indicating the gray and black business suit. It was stylish and cut to accentuate her narrow waist and long legs. "What's wrong with it?" She complained when Yoshi shook his head.</p><p>"Nothing but it won't do for dinner." He walked over to a closet and opened it. "Perhaps you can find something in your size in here." He waved a hand.</p><p>"Are you sure I'm not in heaven?" Noriko said in a hush as she entered the closet. "I sleep in something this size."</p><p>"Quite sure Miss Mata." Yoshi said. "I'll leave you to get settled. My Lady will see you at dinner." With that he exited the room.</p><p>"I don't care what he says." Noriko said to herself. "This is heaven." She ran her hand caressingly down a long line of gowns. Her hand stopped at a neon blue dress. "Please let this fit." She said quietly. She lifted the gown off the rack and held it against her body. "Thank you." She whispered. She carried the gown out of the closet and laid it carefully on the bed. She looked around and spied another door. "I wonder where that leads." She said to herself. She walked over and opened the door. "Bathroom." She squeaked. She walked into the largest bathroom she had ever seen. The tub was filled and the steam rising from the water attested to it being heated and ready. "The rich really are different." She murmured. "But, oh to be rich even for a day." She started to disrobe. "I am going to make the most of this."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Noriko was finishing getting dressed for dinner when there was a knock on the door. "Coming." She said and hurried to open it. "Ms. Kuno." She bowed hurriedly and waved for Kodachi to enter.<p>"Noriko." Kodachi said in greeting. Kodachi was wearing a black evening dress, with matching shoes and, of course, her veil. "Forgive me for not greeting you earlier."</p><p>"No apologies necessary, Ms. Kuno." Noriko replied. "Yoshi mentioned you were in the middle of an experiment."</p><p>"Still I do apologize." Kodachi gave Noriko a critical look. "That dress suits you." She commented. "An excellent selection."</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." Noriko said. "I'm gratified you approve." She looked at the veiled woman. "Pardon my bluntness Ms. Kuno but," Noriko trailed off as she tried to ask the question.</p><p>"I suspect you wish to know what this special assignment is, we'll speak later." She stated. "Are you ready to go down to dinner?" Kodachi asked. Noriko nodded. "Excellent." Kodachi linked her arm through Noriko's. "I must tell you I was very impressed with how well you learned that dance routine. You showed an athleticism I didn't expect."</p><p>Noriko smiled slightly. "I was a bit of a tomboy growing up." She admitted. "I always did like sports."</p><p>"Any martial arts?" Kodachi asked.</p><p>"No, not really." Noriko replied. "Though I did study Kendo for a semester in High School."</p><p>Kodachi raised an eyebrow behind her veil. "Did you." She said thoughtfully. They stopped at a door. "Ah here we are, we'll talk more after dinner." The door opened. "I think you know most of my other guests." Standing around talking were Genma, Nodoka, Soun, and much to Noriko's surprise and pleasure, Koko and her daughter Kiko. The little girl turned.</p><p>"Auntie Dachi." Kiko exclaimed happily and ran over. Kodachi scooped the little girl up into her arms. "Missed you."</p><p>"Missed you too Kiko." Kodachi hugged the little girl and put her down. Taking Kiko's hand she led the girl and Noriko over to Koko. "Koko." She and Kodachi exchanged quick hugs. "Thank you so much for coming tonight."</p><p>Koko laughed. "Oh and disappoint Kiko? I don't think so." She said. "Hey Noriko." They exchanged hugs. "Nice dress."</p><p>"Indeed." Agreed Kodachi. "I believe the last person to wear it was," Kodachi tapped her lower lip with her index finger. "Oh I can't remember her name, some European countess or something."</p><p>"Countess of not, I can't believe she left it behind." Noriko ran her hands down the side of the gown. "I wouldn't."</p><p>"Oh she didn't leave it, not exactly." Kodachi replied. "It's my dress, or rather I had it made." Kodachi explained. "She just wore it."</p><p>Noriko and Koko exchanged a look. "A countess huh?" Noriko asked.</p><p>"A countess." Confirmed Kodachi. "Shall we go in to dinner?"</p><p>Noriko found herself sitting next to Nodoka Saotome. The older woman was impeccably dressed in an elegant kimono. Thinking back on it, it seemed to Noriko that more often than not the woman wore a kimono. 'You'd think such an old fashioned woman would object to what goes on at the club.' She thought. However once seated Nodoka had immediately started inquiring on the club, the clientelle and even the health of the girls.</p><p>"Dr. Ono gives the girls a physical once a month." Noriko had replied in response to the last question. "Everyone is fine." She gave an approving nod. "Probably better than they've ever been in their lives."</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka replied. "And you, Noriko, how are you?"</p><p>Noriko smiled. "I think I'm better than I've ever been as well." She replied. She leaned over. "I hope you don't mind me saying so." She began. "But, well I'm surprised you're so supportive."</p><p>"Ah." Nodoka looked embarrassed for a moment. "That was before I knew," She gave Koko a quick glance. "Before I knew a lot of things." Nodoko sighed. "My son has forced me to open my eyes to the world and see what is, is not what I wish things to be. Meeting Kodachi's girls, and you, has furthered my education." She glanced over to where Koko was talking to Soun. "I did not know such cruelty existed." She turned back to Noriko. Nodoka's smile was strained. "I think, no I know, I would have been happier to continue being ignorant." She said. "I don't think I could do what you do." She laughed self-consciously. "Not that I think anyone would be interested in an old woman like me."</p><p>"Oh I don't know Mrs. Saotome." Noriko said in wry tones. "I think you'd do pretty good."</p><p>Nodoka's eyebrow rose. Then to Noriko's astonishment, the older woman blushed. Nodoka shook herself. "No matter." She said brusquely. "The point is that now that I know and there is no going back to the bliss of ignorance." Nodoka looked again at Koko. "I know some who think someone like Koko deserved what she got."</p><p>Noriko nodded in agreement. "Yeah, I've heard some people say things like that." She said flatly.</p><p>"Well I don't." Nodoka said firmly. "I may not approve of, of what you do, but you're people." She looked at Koko again. "Nice people."</p><p>"We're just people, Mrs. Saotome, but thank you." Noriko leaned over to Nodoka. "Do you have any idea what Ms. Kuno has in mind?" She asked quietly. "She never said anything. Just come for the weekend and be prepared for heavy exercise."</p><p>"Yet you came anyway." Nodoka pointed out.</p><p>"Well it's Ms. Kuno." Noriko said as if that explained everything.</p><p>Possibly it did because Nodoka smiled approvingly. "I see, well I don't want to ruin Kodachi's fun." She hid her mouth with her hand as she giggled. "But, at least she did say heavy exercise." She nodded toward Genma and Soun. "I wondered why she invited them." She said. "Now I know."</p><p>"Well Mr. Saotome is your husband." Noriko said in mild confusion. "And Mr. Tendo is," Noriko paled. "Oh no." She swallowed nervously. "I am not a martial artist." She said.</p><p>"You're not?" Nodoka said in surprise. "But Kodachi is." Nodoka said half to herself. Nodoka pursed her lips. "Ah, I think I see." She gave Noriko a look of respect. "Apparently Kodachi trusts you." She said. "Interesting."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi smiled behind her veil at the childish chatter that came from Kiko. She leaned over. "Hold the fork like this." Kodachi instructed. She helped the little girl adjust her hand. "Perfect." She said. Kodachi straightened then leaned over to Koko. "You don't know how envious I am of you." She told the other woman.<p>"Envious?" Koko said in surprise. "Of me?"</p><p>Kodachi nodded toward Kiko. "Envious." She said. Kodachi sighed. "Thank you again for bringing her."</p><p>Koko bit back the trite phrase that came to her lips. 'Telling Ms. Kuno she'll have her own one day.' She broke off her thought. Koko looked at the veiled woman and her hand went to her scarred cheek. "Thank you for inviting her." Koko replied hesitantly. "Though I do worry she takes too much of your time."</p><p>"Nonsense." Kodachi replied. "If anything I worry I don't give her enough of my time." She looked fondly, and a touch longingly, at the little girl. 'We might have had a little girl Ky.' She thought in regret. 'One just like Kiko.' Kodachi hand reached under her veil to wipe at her eyes. 'Oh Ky, I miss you.' Kodachi felt a touch on her arm and looked down. Kiko was looking at her in childish concern. "Thank you Kiko." Kodachi said in quiet tones. "I'm alright now." She turned back to Koko. "Envious." She repeated.</p><p>Koko smiled in sympathy. "Well if you're sure you don't mind, I guess Kiko can come here more often." She looked at her daughter. "If she does her homework and her chores."</p><p>"Mommy!" Kiko said in childish outrage.</p><p>"Your mother is right." Kodachi said sternly. "And I expect you to do your best." She said. "And your mother will keep me informed." She raised a finger. "Just as I will inform your mother if you misbehave here." Kodachi looked at Koko and the two women exchanged firm nods.</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Kiko grumbled. Then she smiled brightly. "I got an A on my last test." She said proudly."It was math."</p><p>Kodachi tapped Kiko lightly on the nose. "That's my girl." She said in approval.</p><p>I</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>t was morning and Noriko walked into the Kuno training salon with trepidation. She was, as Kodachi had strongly suggested, dressed for a heavy workout. Fortunately Noriko had always been fit and her recent dance rehearsals had toned her body further. Shorts and matching midriff baring top were combined with leggings she had pushed down to her ankles. Early as it was she found Mr. Tendo and Mr. Saotome already there and already engaged in a fierce match. Nodoka Saotome was there as well, kneeling at the edge of the mat and watching the match intently. Noriko walked over and knelt down next to Nodoka. "Good morning." She said quietly.<p>"Good morning." Nodoka replied. She smiled in greeting at Noriko and the two women exchanged polite bows. Nodoka gestured to the match. "They'll be done soon." She informed the younger woman. Nodoka stood. "In the meantime why don't we start stretching."</p><p>Noriko stood. "We?" She asked as the two women walked over to section of the salon. Before Nodoka could answer the door to the salon opened again and Kodachi entered with Koko and Kiko.</p><p>"Oh excellent." Kodachi said as she swept into the salon. "Everyone is here." She stopped in front of Nodoka and Noriko. "Good morning Auntie. Good morning Noriko." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Good morning." Chorused Nodoka and Noriko. "Your timing is excellent Kodachi." Nodoka continued. "We were just about to start our stretches." She informed the Kuno daughter. "Shall we?" They moved to the center of the room and, with to Noriko's surprise, Nodoka leading.</p><p>'Well she is from a martial arts family.' Noriko realized. The stretching period was slow at first, giving everyone time to warm up early morning muscles. Stretching was followed by simple and easy aerobic exercise. The exercise started easy but quickly became more and more intense and Noriko started sweating heavily. She looked at Kodachi who seemed as fresh as if they hadn't exercised at all. Noriko set her jaw and continued grimly.</p><p>The aerobics finally ended and there was a short break as everyone took the opportunity to grab some water and wipe themselves down. The little girl, Kiko, sat between her mother and Kodachi a big happy smile on her face. Once the break ended, Noriko found herself walking shakily back and forth on a balance beam. Noriko grit her teeth and continued without complaint.</p><p>The morning exercises gave way to martial arts training with Mr. Saotome and Mr. Tendo taking over, at least for Noriko and Koko. Kodachi took Kiko over to a separate section and started teaching the little girl some of the basics of gymnastics. Nodoka pled fatigue, something Noriko wished she could do, and sat off to one side to rest.</p><p>Despite the intensity of the workout, Noriko found herself starting to enjoy the training. Looking over to Koko, Noriko could see a similar look of both determination and enjoyment on the other woman's face. During a break the two woman sat side by side. Koko had obviously worn makeup even to the workout but sweat had washed it off leaving the pale, angry scar on her face visible.</p><p>"Gods." Breathed Koko. "I don't think I've exercised this hard since high school." She looked at where her daughter was training with Kodachi. "Huh." She laughed. "At least I'm not going to worry about getting her to sleep tonight." She said.</p><p>"Me neither." Admitted Noriko with her own laugh. "We're going to pay for this in the morning." She looked at Kiko. "Ms. Kuno seems very attached to Kiko." She said in comment.</p><p>Koko nodded. "Yeah." She took a sip of water and watched as Kiko stood on her hands under the watchful guidance of Kodachi. "Don't you dare tell Ms. Kuno but, well I was worried about that." She admitted. "Still am, a little, but." She broke off.</p><p>"She's Ms. Kuno." Noriko said firmly. "She would never do anything wrong."</p><p>Koko laughed. "Oh I know that." She said. "What I meant was I was getting a little jealous." She nodded toward Kodachi and her daughter. "I'm not used to sharing her attention."</p><p>"Ah." Noriko said in understanding. Noriko and Koko watched the interplay for a while before Noriko turned back to Koko. "So?" She asked. "Do you know what this is about?" She waved a hand to encompass everything and everyone. "Ms. Kuno didn't tell me anything."</p><p>"Does it matter?" Koko replied calmly. "I don't know about you but I owe Ms. Kuno." She laughed a little self consciously. Then her hand went to the scar on her cheek. "I owe her my life." She said quietly. "Corny I know, but it's true." She smiled as Kiko came skipping over. "Having fun baby?" She asked the little girl.</p><p>Kiko nodded enthusiastically. "Did you see me standing on my hands?" She asked in a childish babble. "I never stood on my hands before." She said. "Auntie Kodachi said she'd teach me everything she knows." She said. "Please mommy. Please."</p><p>"Well if your Auntie Kodachi isn't too busy." Began Koko.</p><p>"Yayyy." Cheered Kiko. She hugged her mother tightly. "Thank you mommy."</p><p>Kodachi walked up. "remember our deal Kiko." Kodachi said. "You do your chores, study hard." Kodachi looked over the little girl's head at Koko."and listen to your mother."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Promised Kiko.</p><p>"Good." Kodachi said in approval. "Now go over and talk to Auntie Nodoka." She ordered. "I need to speak to your mother and Noriko." She waved her hands. "Shoo." Giggling Kiko ran over to Nodoka. Kodachi watched her run, sighed then turned back to Koko and Noriko. "Thank you again for bringing her." She told Koko. Kodachi sat down on the floor next to Noriko and Koko. "I must say, I'm pleasantly surprised how well the two of you kept up." She looked at Noriko. "especially you Noriko."</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." Noriko said.</p><p>"Unfortunately, neither of you will never be true martial artists." Kodachi said critically. "But I didn't expect that to be the case in any event." She continued. "But it doesn't hurt to be in shape." She shook her head. "No, you'll never be true martial artists." She smiled. "But then again a pimp won't expect a whore to fight back ever. True?"</p><p>"Not if she wants to keep her teeth." Noriko replied. She looked at Koko. "Or her looks." Her eyes widened. "You want to do what the Terrible Three are doing, don't you?" She said in realization. "But Ms. Kuno, everyone knows I work for you."</p><p>"That's where Koko comes in." Kodachi said. "Hair and makeup can change a woman's looks, can they not?" She explained. "And we may need a driver."</p><p>Noriko nodded slowly. "That explains Koko." She said. "And me?"</p><p>"Bait." Kodachi said flatly. "But not yet, not until you can defend yourself."</p><p>Noriko chewed on her lip, then she stood. "Then I'd better start learning how." She said. She bowed to Kodachi. "If you'll excuse me." She said. "Oh and Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Yes Noriko?"</p><p>"thank you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Hey Ran-chan, have you seen the Tomboy?" Ukyo asked.<p>Ranma looked up from watching the television. "Not recently." He replied. He screwed his face up in thought. "I think she said something about needing some fresh air." He shrugged. "Try the roof."</p><p>Ukyo nodded and went outside and up to the roof. "Nope not here." She said. Then she frowned. "Why's it so cold?" She said to herself. The sun was out and it was, everywhere else, a warm spring day. Ukyo concentrated. 'Soul of Ice?' She thought to herself. 'Without someone to watch her?' Ukyo's frown deepened. 'And why is she hiding?' Ukyo scanned the roof with her chi sense. "There you are." She said finally. She walked over to where she sensed Akane hiding in the Umisenken. "No sense hiding sugar, I can sense you."</p><p>"I wasn't hiding." Akane's voice said from seemingly nowhere.</p><p>Ukyo's frown became worried. Akane's voice seemed even more monotone and emotionless than was usual from the Soul of Ice. "Show yourself sugar." The air seemed to blur and ripple in front of Ukyo, when it stopped Akane was revealed standing in front of her though facing away. "You know you're not supposed to go into the Soul of Ice without a spotter." Ukyo scolded.</p><p>"I'm fine." Akane's said distantly.</p><p>"Okay, you're fine." Ukyo said in concern. "Now come out of it."</p><p>"No." Akane replied.</p><p>"No?" Ukyo walked around Akane so she could see her face. "What do you mean no?"</p><p>"I'm fine." Akane repeated in the same distant voice. "It's peaceful."</p><p>"I know sugar but you have to come out of it." Ukyo said gently. Ukyo grabbed Akane's shoulders to shake her and immediately pulled her hands away. "Damn you're freezing." She looked at Akane. "Please sugar, come out of it."</p><p>Akane seemed to hesitate then shook her head. "No." She repeated.</p><p>"Ranma!" Ukyo shouted over her shoulder. She turned back to Akane. "Come on sugar, you're scaring me." She said. Akane said nothing. "At least tell me why." Ukyo persisted. "And something other than 'it's peaceful'." She added. "Please Akane, talk to me."</p><p>"what's going on Uk, oh crap." Ranma raced over and before either Akane or Ukyo could react, punched the dark haired girl in the jaw and knocked her unconscious. Ranma caught Akane before she fell. "Stupid, stupid Tomboy." Ranma said in quiet tones. He carried her gently into the apartment. "She's gonna hate me when she wakes up."</p><p>"I hope so Ran-chan." Ukyo said seriously. "Better than her acting like a robot." She explained. "I thought she was getting better." Ukyo followed Ranma into the bedroom and watched as Ranma carefully put Akane in the bed and pulled the covers over the dark haired girl.</p><p>"She is." Ranma said. He smoothed the cover over Akane. "My poor Tomboy."</p><p>"I wonder what triggered this?" Ukyo sat down on the bed next to Akane. "She's got to know by now that you love her." She looked at Ranma. "You do love her don't you?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Yeah." He said. "Maybe I don't tell her that enough." He sat down on the other side of the bed. Akane made a noise and Ranma put a smile on his face. "Hey Tomboy."</p><p>"Wha-what happened?" Akane said groggily. Her hand went to her jaw. "Ow. That hurts."</p><p>"You're going to have a nice bruise too." Ukyo said. "Welcome back." Ukyo said. "You got stuck in the Soul of Ice."</p><p>Akane rubbed her jaw and nodded. She turned her head and looked at Ranma. "Couldn't you think of a better way to pull me out of it?" She asked grumpily. She ran her tongue over her back teeth. "I think you loosened a tooth."</p><p>"Better your tooth then half the city block." Ranma replied. A sudden clap of thunder punctuated Ranma's words. "With all the cold chi you were putting out I'm surprised it took so long for the storm to hit."</p><p>"I made it rain?" Akane asked in disbelief.</p><p>"No." Ranma replied. There was another thunderbolt. "You made it storm."</p><p>"You're joking?" She looked at Ukyo. "Tell me he's joking."</p><p>"Beats me sugar." Ukyo replied. "You joking?" She asked Ranma.</p><p>"Nope." Ranma replied. "Congratulations Tomboy." Ranma said. "You don't need to use battle chi to create a storm." Ranma explained. "Just a warm day." Ranma grinned. "Even I can't do that." He said. "Yet."</p><p>"Are you crazy Ran-chan?" Ukyo complained. "She was stuck in the Soul of Ice." She looked at Akane. "You didn't want to come back sugar." She said worriedly. "You said you were happy."</p><p>"I am Uk-chan." Akane replied. "Mostly." She admitted. "It's hard to explain." Akane rubbed her jaw. There was another clap of thunder. Akane looked out the window. Rain started spattering the glass. "I did that?" A slight smile came to her lips. "Cool."</p><p>"You're both crazy, you know that?" Ukyo said testily. "You scared the shit out of me Akane."</p><p>"Sorry Uk-chan." Akane took Ukyo's hand in a gentle grip. "Really, I'm sorry. I didn't know that was going to happen." Akane smiled. "But you should know by now that the two of us really are crazy."</p><p>Ukyo snorted. "No kidding. Two of a kind, the both of you."</p><p>"Yep." Ranma and Akane chorused. The three broke up into laughter. Akane sat up in the bed and rubbed her jaw again. "Well I'm definitely not working tonight." She shrugged. "A night off sounds nice."</p><p>"Yeah and with the storm you called up, not too many people will be out tonight anyway." Ranma said. "Movie night." He stated. "Anyone feel like watching the new Ryoga and Konatsu tape?"</p><p>"I'll make the popcorn." Ukyo said. She jumped up and ran out of the room.</p><p>Akane put the tip of her index finger between her lips. "What should I do?" Akane asked in her Aoi voice.</p><p>"Just lie there and be cute." Ranma replied. "Okay Baby?"</p><p>"Okay Baby." Akane replied in her Aoi voice. Akane watched Ranma leave and stretched. "Ow." She said. "Jerk," She grinned when she said it. Akane got up and got out of her clothes and into an oversized t-shirt. "We're not going out tonight." She said to herself. Akane jumped back into the bed. "a night home with my two favorite people; sounds like heaven to me." She said. "What more can I ask for?"</p><p>She listened to the rain patter on the window and lost herself in the sound. 'I did that.' She thought in amazement. The smell of popcorn made her look up. Ukyo walked in holding a big bowl of popcorn. Ukyo had also changed into an oversized t-shirt. Akane smiled reassuringly at the anxious look on Ukyo's face. "It's okay, Uk-chan." Akane said "I really am sorry for scaring you." Akane patted the bed. "Now come over here with that popcorn."</p><p>Ukyo's smile was one of relief. She walked over to the bed, handed the bowl of popcorn to Akane, and sat down next to her. The door to the bedroom opened. "Hey save some popcorn for me.." Ranma said. He held up a small case. "Found it." He said. Ranma had changed as well and was wearing pajama bottoms. He inserted the disc into the player, grabbed the remote, and jumped into the bed. "Comfortable Tomboy?"</p><p>"A cuddle would be nice." Akane said. She nearly purred when Ranma wrapped her in his arms. "That meant you too Uk-chan." Akane said after awhile. Ukyo cuddled up against Akane's back. "I really, really am sorry for scaring both of you." Akane said quietly. "But I really, really am happy." Akane smiled as the hugs tightened. "I wouldn't trade us for the world and I mean that."</p><p>"So why didn't you want to come back?" Ranma asked. He looked at Akane's face. The dark haired girl had her eyes closed but she seemed at peace.</p><p>"Just being chicken I guess." Akane replied. She opened her eyes. "Even that deep in the Soul of Ice, the memory of what it's like coming out of it held me back. " She shrugged inside the encircling arms. "For what it's worth, Uk-chan nearly had me out of it even before you slugged me." She rolled slightly dislodging the bowl of popcorn.</p><p>Ukyo grabbed the popcorn bowl before it spilled. "Hey let's not waste that."</p><p>Akane laughed happily. "Good point." She said. "Let me up guys." Akane sat up and grabbed a handful of popcorn. "Now let's watch that movie." Ranma laughed and pressed a couple of buttons on the remote. The video began to play. Akane sat back and chewed on some popcorn. She shook her head. "He is such a jerk."</p><p>"Worse than me?" Ranma asked with a grin. He grabbed some popcorn.</p><p>"It's close but yeah." Akane grinned back.</p><p>"Whoa." Said Ranma as Akane's smile became blinding. "I remember that smile." He said. "Welcome back Tomboy." Ranma said. He put his arm around Akane. "I missed you."</p><p>"I missed me too." Akane replied with a laugh.</p><p>"You guys want to be alone?" Ukyo asked from her side of the bed. "I can sleep in the spare bedroom."</p><p>"Hell no." Akane giggled. "You're not going anywhere Uk-chan, if you hadn't noticed, Ranma is being very guy tonight." She elbowed a smiling Ranma. Akane rubbed her jaw. "And since my mouth is currently out of commission," She grinned at Ukyo's bark of laughter. "Exactly."</p><p>"Besides it's a rainy night." Ranma added. "Why be alone if you don't have to be?"</p><p>"Okay, okay, I give up." Ukyo said laughing. "Just so you admit I did offer."</p><p>"You offered Uk-chan." Ranma said. "But you haven't heard either one of us saying we wanted to change anything." He looked over as Akane shook her head. "And you haven't found anyone else." He pointed out.</p><p>"Not looking." Admitted Ukyo. "Don't feel like looking."</p><p>"Then until you do, your place is here." Akane said. "Now, shut up and let's watch the movie." Akane pulled Ukyo closer to her and leaned against Ranma. They watched the movie. "He is such a jerk." Akane repeated after awhile.</p><p>End Chapter 2</p><p>Author's Notes: Wow what a welcome back. Too many people posted reviews for me to list them all. Though apparently I'm going to need something to remove all the glue from my shoes. Heh.</p><p>Couple things - Yeah there is a lemon. Not necessary for the plot or anything though it does give a little bit of insight into the characters. BTW Howard, you completely defined the difference between porn and erotica. Email requests only. There was a question about a blog or website. Just so happens I'm on MySpace.</p><p>Oh and Wharpt - Put the crystal ball down and back away.</p>
