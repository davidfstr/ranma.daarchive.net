</div><p>Chapter 5</p><p>'The importance of being Ranma'</p><p>Hikaru blocked Shampoo's punch and returned with his own punch. The two were battling at such intense speed that their arms and legs were nothing but blurs. Hikaru may have considered women in general to be the weaker sex but he was not stupid enough to take Shampoo lightly. Even so, his attitude did affect his judgment to a degree and that weakness was exploited by Shampoo to land some painful blows. "Ow." Hikaru rubbed his head where Cologne hit him with her staff. "Stop that you old ghoul."</p><p>"Pay attention." Snapped Cologne. "Stop thinking like a man and start thinking like a warrior." She said. "Shampoo is still able to distract you with a bit of skin. Ranma will spot that weakness and exploit it."</p><p>"A bit of skin." Hikaru snorted. "She keeps flashing her tits and ass at me." He complained. "Ow! Will you stop that you old ghoul."</p><p>"Do you think Ranma will do any less?" Cologne snapped back in reply. "It's one of his favorite tricks." She said. "He used it to help him defeat Herb. He will use anything, do anything to win."</p><p>"So will I." Hikaru said confidently.</p><p>"So you say." Cologne sneered. "But I have my doubts." She hopped over to a low chest set against one side of the dojo. She opened it and rummaged around for a moment. "Ah here it is." She turned and tossed a packet to Hikaru. He caught it.</p><p>"What is it?" He asked. He examined the packet. "My Chinese isn't that good. 'Girl Water'? He hazarded.</p><p>"Those powders are made from the cursed springs of Jusenkyo." Cologne intoned. "Each spring has its' own curse." She nodded toward the packet. "Mix that with cold water then bathe in the water for several minutes." She directed. "See if you can spend a day or two in Ranma's shoes."</p><p>Shampoo clapped her hands together in glee. "Shampoo wonder when Great grandmama do this." She said. "You hurry Hikaru. Shampoo want see what Hikaru look like as girl."</p><p>"Now wait a minute." Hikaru backed away. "I'm not turning into no bitch."</p><p>"What's the matter son-in-law? Afraid?" Cologne chuckled nastily. "It's only for a couple days." She hopped over on her staff. "You must get over your foolish weakness and this will help." She said coldly. "Consider this a test to see if we will continue to support you."</p><p>Hikaru looked at Cologne in disbelief. "Don't give me that crap." He said arrogantly. "Who else is there?"</p><p>"The Joketsuzoku are an ancient people." Cologne replied. "We've learned patience. If this is not the time to put our plan into action then it is not the time. We can wait." Cologne cackled. "And there is always Ranma."</p><p>"You listen to great grandmother." Shampoo added. "You very strong, very powerful." She said. Shampoo preened slightly. "That why you Airen. Shampoo deserve best, strongest man." She shook a finger at Hikaru. "Right now, Ranma still best."</p><p>"Bullshit." Snapped Hikaru.</p><p>"Not bullshit." Shampoo shot back. "Ranma have no weakness. Not in fight. Once fight start Ranma only think about fight. Think about winning." She said. "Nothing distract him. He master 'Soul of Ice'."</p><p>"Soul of Ice?" Hikaru asked in sudden interest. "What's that?"</p><p>"A technique you are not ready for." Cologne said dismissively. "If, and only if mind you, if you are able to overcome your slavery to your gonads then maybe you will be ready to learn the technique." She nodded toward the packet. "That will be a first step."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru stared at the fizzing water suspiciously and with some trepidation. He had to admit he learned more in the year he spent with the old biddy then he had under some of the best teachers in Japan. He was faster, stronger, more powerful then ever. Some of the things she had taught him were straight out of folklore. There was one thing he'd never admit, not aloud. He was afraid of her. 'I'd kill her if I thought I could get away with it.' He told himself not for the first time.<p>"Hurry and get in water Airen." Shampoo said impatiently. "Want see what you look like as girl." She smiled seductively. "Who know, maybe you be cute."</p><p>"I don't want to be a girl." Hikaru grumbled. "And especially not a cute one." He looked at the water. "Explain to me why I'm supposed to do this again."</p><p>"Because Great grandmother say so." Shampoo replied immediately. "Get in water. Get in water." Shampoo said excitedly.</p><p>Hikaru stared at the water for a minute more than slowly lowered his body into the cold water. He felt his body suddenly seem to twist nauseatingly though painlessly. The nausea increased and Hikaru thrashed in the water. "Gotta get out." He gasped. Hikaru's voice seemed to rise in octave even as he spoke. With a last effort Hikaru got out of the tub and collapsed gasping on the floor. The nausea quickly passed and Hikaru sat up or tried to. Hikaru's center of gravity and his balance was off. Hikaru looked down, his mouth worked soundlessly for a moment, then...she screamed.</p><p>Cologne hopped into the bathroom on her staff. "Stop screaming son-in-law." Scolded Cologne. "I told you what was going to happen."</p><p>"I'm a slit. I'm a goddamned slit." Hikaru moaned. She rocked back and forth as she moaned. Then Hikaru jumped to her feet and charged Cologne. "You bitch. You goddamned bitch." She shouted in hysteria.</p><p>"Enough son-in-law." Snapped Cologne. "The effect is only temporary." She said. "And necessary." She waited until Hikaru was close enough and then tossed her into the air. "Shampoo calm your Airen and then get her dressed." She ordered. "When she's properly under control bring her to me."</p><p>Hikaru swallowed. "Okay Hikaru you can handle this." She muttered to himself. When Shampoo took her arm she allowed hersellf to be led on wobbly legs. She looked at Shampoo, the lavendar haired amazon was grinning at her. "What are you looking at?" She snapped.</p><p>"You make cute girl." Shampoo giggled. "Like hair. Pink my favorite color."</p><p>"I was hoping that was just my eyes playing tricks on me." Hikaru complained. She was getting used to her body now. As they walked Hikaru held out her hand and flexed it. "You're enjoying this aren't you?" She asked dangerously. Her hand lashed out and backhanded Shampoo. "Well don't." She growled.</p><p>Shampoo's eyes narrowed in amusement. "That pitiful." She sneered. "This how woman hit." Her own backhand blow knocked Hikaru backwards.</p><p>"I'm gonna kill you bitch." Hikaru snarled. She launched an attack but was unable to even connect. "What? What's wrong with me?" She gasped.</p><p>"You shorter for one thing." Shampoo grabbed Hikaru and put the, now, girl in a hammerlock. "Arms shorter. Legs shorter. You not know how to use new body." Shampoo smiled nastily. 'Maybe I ask great grandmother for powder for spring of drowned young man.' Shampoo thought. 'On second thought, not ask. She might say no.'</p><p>"Don't think I'm gonna forget this bitch." Hikaru growled in suppressed fear. "This stuff is gonna wear off in a couple days and then we'll see who is laughing then."</p><p>Shampoo laughed. "Many thing happen in two day." She replied. She continued to push Hikaru along the corridor of their lair. They reached a room and Shampoo shoved Hikaru into the room. "Great grandmother want you dressed." She nodded toward the bed. "Put on clothes."</p><p>Hikaru looked at the clothes on the bed in disbelief. "You have got to be kidding."</p><p>"No kid." Shampoo chirped. "You learn Amazon secrets, you dress like Amazon"</p><p>"Fuck that." Hikaru snarled.</p><p>Cologne looked up from her scroll at the sound of approaching footsteps. She suppressed an evil cackle. Shampoo was dragging a resisting Hikaru. Shampoo turned and slapped Hikaru hard adding another bruise to the already bruised face of the angry hitman. "Good." She said. "Now that you're properly dressed, we can begin the training."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane looked around her before she ducked into a storefront. She breathed out a sigh of relief and leaned against the door. Akane pushed off the door and walked over to the counter. "Hey Mitsi." She greeted the shopkeeper. "My package show up?"<p>Mitsi smiled shyly at Akane. "It's here Aoi." She said. She reached under the counter and pulled out a small package and put it on the counter. "Twenty thousand yen." She said.</p><p>Akane nodded and reached into her bra. She counted out a sum and handed it to Mitsi. "And a little extra for your help." Akane said quietly. She looked around. "No problems?"</p><p>"No Aoi." Mitsi replied with some relief in her voice. "I-I want to thank you for, what you did." She said quietly. "Daddy's feeling better now that I can afford his medicine."</p><p>Akane blushed from the praise. "Hey you're paying for protection aren't you?" She said trying to sound hard. "I was just doing my job."</p><p>Mitsi smiled. "Sure." She said quietly. "Well I just want you to know I appreciate it." She walked out from behind the counter and over to a freezer. "I don't know if you like ice cream but,"</p><p>"Ice Cream?" Interrupted Akane. "Please tell me you have fudge ripple."</p><p>Mitsi giggled. "It just so happens I do." She opened the refrigerator and pulled out a gallon tub. "Here please as a gift from me and my father."</p><p>"Thanks."Akane said in gratitude. "Wait till Usagi sees this." She said cheerfully. She took the tub of Ice cream. "Well gotta go." She waved goodbye and ran out the door. Akane quickly leaped to the rooftops and raced across the skyline and toward home. Though excited she did not ignore her surroundings. She quickly made it to the apartment. "I'm home." She sang.</p><p>Ukyo walked out of the bedroom she shared with Akane. "Hey sugar. Good timing, Ran-chan isn't home yet." She looked at what Akane was carrying. "Tell me that's fudge ripple." She sighed happily at Akane's nod. "What's in the package?" She asked a moment later. "Don't tell me..." She said after a moment. Her eyes widened at Akane's nod. "You're kidding."</p><p>Akane followed Ukyo into the kitchen. "No." She put the package on the counter and checked the wrappings carefully. She smiled at something. "Good it wasn't tampered with." She said. She unwrapped the package to reveal a small box. She opened it. There were two dozen packets inside. She lifted one out and examined it. She nodded.</p><p>"Wow." Ukyo said. She took the packet from Akane. "So are you going to change before he gets home?"</p><p>Akane shook her head. "This time I'm going to ask him if he wants to do this." Akane said firmly. "I may be slow but I learn." She smiled as Ukyo hugged her. "Thanks Uk-chan." She looked at the packet. "Do you think he'll say no?"</p><p>"No." Ukyo replied easily. "Not if you ask nicely." She chuckled. "Having ice cream ready will help." She shared a giggle with Akane. "The real question will be if he'll want both of us to do it or one at a time." She and Akane giggled again. "The real, real question will be which sex he'll be at the time."</p><p>"Yeah." Akane said cheerfully. She ran over to a kitchen alter and lit some incense. She bowed her head. "Please don't let me screw this up." She prayed. Akane went over to the kitchen counter and leaned against it. "Don't you let me screw this up either." She said to Ukyo.</p><p>"I got your back sugar." Ukyo replied. She gave Akane a look. "Come to think of it, I kind of hope Ranma just wants you to turn guy." She said. "I've always fantasized about two guys."</p><p>"Why Ukyo Kuonji, I would never have guessed." Akane replied. "Me too." Akane stretched her arms to the side. "I feel good." She said. She turned at a sound. "Oh crap, Ranma's home."</p><p>"Breath sugar." Ukyo said with a chuckle. "Let's see what kind of mood he's in first." She waved Akane out of the kitchen. She followed chuckling.</p><p>The door opened and Ranma trotted into the apartment. "I'm home." He sang cheerfully. He smiled as Akane and Ukyo hurried over. "Hey girls." He greeted. His smile widened as both Akane and Ukyo embraced him. "Hey someone's in a good mood." He decided.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane agreed. "You." Akane smiled. "Good run?"</p><p>Ranma nodded. "Yeah. I even got a little workout in." He said cheerfully. "Someone tried to rob a tea shop. Didn't break a sweat but he was a pretty sneaky customer."</p><p>Akane and Ukyo laughed. "I'll bet." Ukyo said. "You hungry?"</p><p>"Nah." Ranma replied. "I had something on the way home."</p><p>"Not even for ice cream?" Akane said teasingly. "Fudge ripple."</p><p>Ranma perked up. "Fudge ripple, why didn't you say so?" He wiggled slightly. "I love fudge ripple."</p><p>"We know." Akane chuckled. "Wait here, I'll get you some." Akane stood and walked into the kitchen. She quickly filled three bowls with ice cream and brought them out to find Ranma and Ukyo in a tight embrace. "Hey hey." Akane scolded. "You can fool around after. I have ice cream." She sat down on Ranma's other side. She handed a bowl to Ranma and Ukyo. "Here eat your ice cream."</p><p>"Spoilsport." Ukyo muttered cheerfully. She gave Akane a wink. "You can make it up to me later." She said darkly.</p><p>"Oh?" Akane replied. "Wanna sleep in my room tonight?"</p><p>Ranma scratched his head. "Um, doesn't Uk-chan usually sleep in your room?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"She meant her bed Ran-chan." Ukyo said dryly. She looked at Akane inquiringly. "I don't know sugar, as fun as you can be, I think Ran-chan was about to ask me." She tilted her head. "And I'm in the mood for something you can't provide. Toys aren't quite the same sugar."</p><p>"Well I have to give you that." Akane replied. "However, I seem to have come across something that might wipe that smug look off of Ranma's face." She extracted a packet from her pocket. She wiggled the packet. "I got a package from China." She sang invitingly.</p><p>Ukyo suppress a grin. 'Good catch sugar.' Ukyo thought. "Oh?" She asked archly. "Do tell."</p><p>"Hey!" Ranma exclaimed. "I recognize that." He grabbed the packet from Akane. "Akane!" He said in indignation. "I can't believe you got this and didn't tell me."</p><p>"I didn't think you'd be interested." Akane purred.</p><p>"Not interested?" Ranma said in disbelief. 'Of course I'm interested. I mean." Ranma stopped. "Thanks Tomboy." He said after a long pause.</p><p>"You're welcome jerk." Akane replied impishly. "Now for the sixty four thousand dollar question; if I turn guy what are you going to be."</p><p>"Both. Duh." Ranma replied. "Sheesh, I thought we were passed that." He said in a mildly waspish tone. "The real question is what am I going to be first?"</p><p>"Good point." Ukyo said. "From a purely selfish point of view I vote for you two being guys. You don't know how long I've fantasized about two guys." Ukyo primly wiped the edge of her mouth with a napkin.</p><p>"You're just lazy." Akane retorted. "You'll just lie there and let us do all the work." Akane said accusingly.</p><p>"Sure I will." Ukyo drawled. "Knowing you two, and I do know you two, I'm going to have to work twice as hard."</p><p>"Keep talking like that and you'll be the one using the water." Akane shot back.</p><p>"Now there's an idea." Ranma said cheerfully. "And I get to be the only one who can change back."</p><p>"Well I don't know." Akane said reluctantly.</p><p>"Aw come on Tomboy." Ranma said pleadingly. "I got a lot of years of pent up curiosity to work off."</p><p>"You are such a slut Ran-chan." Ukyo mock complained. "A greedy slut."</p><p>"Yeah I know." Ranma replied cheerfully. "Please."</p><p>"Girl first." Ukyo demanded. "Deal?"</p><p>"Deal." Ranma shot back immediately. He jumped up. "I'm taking a quick shower. " He hurried off.</p><p>Akane and Ukyo looked at each other and giggled. "Well that was easy." Akane commented. Akane licked her lips. "I thought he'd put up a bigger fight."</p><p>"I don't know why you'd think that, sugar." Ukyo looked toward the bathroom door. "We've been telling him that toys aren't the same for some time now."</p><p>"Yeah, I know." Akane sighed. "It's just it was bad enough being jealous of every girl he looks at, now I'm I'm going to be jealous of every guy he looks at too." She shot a sour glare at a giggling Ukyo. "Sure, make fun of my pain." She grumbled. Akane sighed. "At least he said please." She mused. "It's been a long time since he did that." She looked at Ukyo. "Speaking of which; please let me be first. Okay Ukyo?"</p><p>"Sloppy seconds again." Grumped Ukyo. "Tell you what, you get her pussy first." She jabbed her chest with her thumb. "I get his butt first."</p><p>Akane extended her hand. "Deal." She and Ukyo shook on it. The door to the bathroom opened and Ranma raced out, in female form, with a towel around her waist. "Wear something nice." Akane called after her retreating back. "Come on Ukyo, let's go change."</p><p>"Right behind you sugar." Ukyo replied. She reached over and grabbed Akane's ass. "Oh yeah. This is going to be fun."</p><p>Akane snorted. "And I call Ranma a pervert." The two women went into the bathroom. One of the features of their apartment that they liked was that the bathroom was on the large size and two could use it comfortably at the same time. They quickly stripped down. Ukyo turned the shower on while Akane filled two bathing buckets with cold water and added a packet of the magic powders to each. Akane then joined Ukyo in the shower. They bathed quickly. Akane turned the shower off and exited the shower. She walked over and picked up one of the buckets. "Here Ukyo, you can go first."</p><p>Ukyo took the bucket and looked at it. Finally with a deep breath she poured the contents over her head. She staggered slightly as the change occurred. "Whoa" She said almost breathlessly. "That felt strange." He looked down. "Oh my."</p><p>"Well let me see." Akane said in suppressed excitement. She whistled when Ukyo exited the shower. "Big Daddy lives." She said gleefully. "My turn." Akane exchanged places with Ukyo and it was her turn to pour the magic waters over herself. Like Ukyo the change caused Akane to almost lose her balance. She panted from the shock then he left the shower. "How do I look?" Akane rumbled in a baritone.</p><p>"Like a heavier version of your dad." Ukyo decided. He had wrapped a towel around his waist and tossed a second to Akane. "Well dry off already." She said. "If I know Ranma, she'll have started without us."</p><p>Akane giggled in a baritone. "Yeah." Akane looked down. "Damn, guys really can't control it can they?" He smiled in anticipation. "Oh this is going to be fun."</p><p>"Just remember to take it slowly." Ukyo said more to herself than Akane. "I want Ran-chan smiling in the morning." She walked around. "Damn, I'm still wobbly."</p><p>"We just got to make it to the bedroom." Akane said with a laugh. "After that we can relax."</p><p>"With Ran-chan?" Ukyo snorted. "The greedy slut is going to wear both of us out and you know it."</p><p>"Yeah." Akane said in happy anticipation. "Stop playing with yourself." Akane said a moment later. "Save it for Ranma." He grinned. "Well save most of it for Ranma." Akane took a deep breath and let it out. "Ready?"</p><p>"Ready sugar." Ukyo replied. The two now men exited the bathroom and walked to the larger of the two bedrooms. It wasn't as easy a task as they had expected. Everything was off. Things were either to close or too far away. "How does he do it?" Ukyo asked quietly. "I keep feeling like I'm about to fall forward all the time."</p><p>Akane stopped at the door of the bedroom. He knocked on the door a little louder than he had anticipated. "Oops." Akane opened the door. The bedroom was dimly, but adequately, lit. The low lighting gave the room a warm and comfortingly close feeling. Ranma was sitting at the vanity brushing out her air. She turned in her seat. She was naked. "Hey boys." Ranma said throatily. "New in town?"</p><p>"Why yes." Akane replied with a slight smile. "Yes we are."</p><p>Ranma rose languidly from the chair and walked toward the two new men like a stalking cat. She stopped in front of Akane and Ukyo. "Hi." She said in the same husky tone. "I'm the welcoming committee."</p><p>Ukyo rubbed his chin. "Isn't a committee usually more than one person?" His eyes narrowed in appreciation as they ranged over Ranma's naked body. Even though she'd seen Ranma naked and female hundreds of times for some reason it seemed different.</p><p>Ranma grinned. "Don't worry sugar, I qualify." She said in a purr. "You boys looking for a date tonight?"</p><p>Akane turned to Ukyo. "What do you think chum?" He asked. "Do you think she'll do?"</p><p>"I can do a lot of things." Ranma turned slowly around. "And I got a lot to do it with." She continued when she again faced them. "Wouldn't you agree? She smiled at the twin gulps coming from Akane and Ukyo. She reached out and grabbed the towels that surrounded the men's waists. "Plus I'm having a two for one special."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Yes there is a lemon scene. Email to get it.<hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru Nakamura dragged himself from his training. It was bad enough that was now a girl and wearing a dress. "What was I thinking?" She grumped to herself. As bad as being a girl and wearing a dress was, the training Cologne had put her through was even worse. The damned harness she wore contributed to most of the bruises. Every time she got angry the harness would contract violently and the old ghoul seemed to delight in tormenting her.<p>Hikaru would have hit something but she was too tired. Still she was beginning to get some control. 'That's something.' She thought. If the old biddy was telling the truth, the power she'd possess would be incredible. 'I just wish I knew why I had to be a girl for this. From what I experienced today it wasn't necessary.' Hikaru staggered slightly from exhaustion. She barely had time to eat and wash and it was a relief to finally get some sleep. She tiredly pushed open the door to her room, entered and slowly undressed. She was so tired she didn't bother putting on her pajamas and just collapsed, naked, on the bed.</p><p>Hikaru had just started to nod off when the door to the bedroom opened. "Whoever that is, it can wait until morning." Hikaru snapped tiredly.</p><p>"Oh no." A deep masculine voice answered. "This perfect time." A tall and muscular and very naked Amazon walked into the room. Tired as Hikaru was, something about the man was familiar. The man walked over to the bed. "I see you ready for me." The man said with a leer.</p><p>"Who are you and what do you want?" Hikaru said with a touch of fear.</p><p>"What? You no recognize me." The warrior said in amusement as he climbed into the bed. Hikaru tried to scramble away but was immediately pinned beneath the muscular warrior's body. "Hello Airen."</p><p>"Shampoo." Gasped Hikaru. Hikaru felt something pressing against her nether regions. "What do you think, no stop. No. Shampoo. No. No."</p><p>"What you say first time we do this?" The male Shampoo said. "Oh yes, shut up and spread bitch." He said. "So now you turn to shut up and spread bitch." Shampoo smiled cruelly. "Oh that feel nice." Shampoo said. "See why you like it."</p><p>"I'll kill you." Screamed Hikaru. "Get off of me. I'll kill you. I'll kill you." Hikaru struggled desperately but was unable to dislodge Shampoo . To Hikaru's anger and shame tears began to flow from her eyes. "I'll kill you." She whimpered.</p><p>"Oh no Airen." Shampoo said with an evil laugh. "You no kill me, soon you beg me for this. You see."</p><p>"No." Screamed Hikaru.</p><p>Cologne looked up from the potion she was working on. She cackled. "I knew Shampoo wouldn't be able to resist." She said to herself. "I think we'll keep Hikaru female for a week. That should be long enough." Cologne cackled again and returned to her potion.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo raced across the rooftops in the early morning sun. Ranma, in male form, led the run. It used to be easy to outrace Akane and Ukyo, but recently his two lovers had seemed to develop additional speed. Not that Ranma was complaining, with the way things were working out, any improvement in their skills was something to be encouraged. Ranma looked over his shoulder and stuck his tongue out at the trailing women.<p>"That a challenge Saotome?" Akane called.</p><p>"You bet." Ranma shouted back. "Catch me if you can." Ranma sped up. To his pride and pleasure both Akane and Ukyo kept up. Akane even managed to close the gap a little. 'Whoa, the Tomboy is really cruising.' He picked up the pace even more. A serious look appeared on Akane's face and she managed to close the distance even more. With a final burst of speed and energy Akane caught up with Ranma and wrapped her arms around his waist.</p><p>"Got ya." Crowed Akane. She planted her feet and the two of them stopped so suddenly that Ukyo continued passed them for nearly a hundred meters before she stopped and turned around. When she got there Akane had Ranma bent backwards and was kissing him hungrily.</p><p>"Well I guess I know what Akane wants for a prize." Cracked Ukyo. "Sloppy seconds again." She grumped playfully. She walked to edge the roof and looked around. 'Been quiet.' She mused. 'I don't like it.' She turned around. "Okay you two, break it up."</p><p>"Aww." Protested Akane and Ranma in unison. "Spoilsport." Akane added.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, I know." Ukyo said easily. "I'm hungry." She said. "And there is nothing to eat up here." She rolled her eyes at Akane's giggle. "No food that is." She amended. "Now let's go home."</p><p>The three resumed their race across the rooftops only this time toward their apartment. It was only a matter of minutes before they were jogging into the apartment. Ranma claimed the bathroom and Akane followed Ukyo into the kitchen. To Ukyo's surprise Akane hugged her from behind. Ukyo turned in Akane's arms. "You're in a good mood, sugar."</p><p>"After last night, why wouldn't I be?" Akane leaned forward and captured Ukyo's mouth with her own. The kiss that followed was as hungry as the one she gave Ranma earlier. Ukyo returned the kiss without any hesitation. Akane broke the kiss and sighed. "I was thinking of using the packet again, "Akane twiddled her fingers. "And I was wondering if you wouldn't mind being the girl tonight."</p><p>Ukyo tilted her head. "Let me get this straight, you want to be a guy again?" She said. She smiled at Akane's nod. "That I can understand but you want both of us even though you probably could have Ranma all to yourself tonight, is that it?" Akane nodded again. "And what were you planning on asking Ranma to be?"</p><p>"A guy." Akane replied. "Aw hell Ukyo, you've been so nice to me, I was hoping to do something nice in return."</p><p>"Ask Ranma first." Ukyo said. Then she grinned. "And then when he says okay, tell him he's sleeping in our room tonight."</p><p>"Awright." Akane pumped her arms triumphantly. "You're the best Uk-chan."</p><p>"Don't you forget that, sugar." Ukyo replied. "Now get out while I make breakfast."</p><p>"Yes ma'am. Right away ma'am." Akane giggled and hurried out of the room. She went to the bathroom and knocked. "It's me." She called through the door. Akane opened the door. "Hey save some hot water for us." She complained cheerfully.</p><p>Ranma opened the shower door. "Well if we showered together we wouldn't worry about running out of hot water." He replied.</p><p>Akane hurriedly stripped off her clothes. "You don't have to ask me twice." She said and got into the shower with Ranma. She wrapped her arms around Ranma from behind. "This is nice." She murmured into Ranma's back. "I could stay like this for hours."</p><p>"We'd turn into prunes, if we did." Ranma cracked. "But I know what you mean." Ranma turned in Akane's embrace. "I was wonderin'" Ranma began hesitantly.</p><p>Akane looked up. "Why Ranma you're blushing." She giggled. "Liked last night huh?" She teased. "Uk-chan and I liked it too." Akane licked her lips. "Wanna do it again?"</p><p>"And you call me a pervert." Ranma smiled down at Akane. "Yeah, I do."</p><p>"Oh good." Akane laughed. "Though I was wondering if you'd mind if Ukyo stayed a girl this time. She's been so nice to me, I thought, well it is her fantasy." Akane sighed when Ranma hugged her tightly. "I guess that means yes." She smiled when Ranma turned off the shower and reached out and snagged the towel and started drying Akane off. "I love you Ranma." Akane whispered.</p><p>"I love you too Tomboy." Ranma replied gently. He was about to say more when Akane placed her hand over his mouth.</p><p>"No promises, remember?" Akane said quietly. "I love you. You love me." She smiled. "That's good enough for me."</p><p>"And Ukyo?" Asked Ranma.</p><p>"Ukyo?" Akane started drying Ranma off. "Next to you she's my best friend." There was a knock on the door. "Come on in Uk-chan." She said. The door opened. "You know you're timing is perfect."</p><p>"Helps to be listening at the door." Ukyo admitted. She walked over and kissed Akane on the cheek. "You're my second best friend too, sugar." She looked at Ranma. "Well?"</p><p>Akane elbowed Ranma in the ribs. "Tell her you love her dummy." She hissed.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Yes Tomboy." He replied. "I love you Uk-chan."</p><p>"Love you too Ran-chan." Ukyo tapped her foot. "Now the two of you get out of here so I can take a quick shower."</p><p>"Ranma is sleeping in our room tonight." Akane said as she wrapped a towel around herself. "You get to be the girl."</p><p>"You know you've been sleeping there so much recently you might as well move in." Ukyo grumped slightly. She started removing her clothes. "You don't have to straighten up after."</p><p>"Yeah." Agreed Akane. She finished drying off. "Come on Ranma. Let's let Uk-chan take her shower."</p><p>"Don't let her near the stove Ran-chan." Ukyo closed the shower door. Ukyo heard the bathroom door open and close. "He didn't say no like he usually does." She mused. Ukyo grinned. "Kewl."</p><p>End Chapter 5</p><p>Author's Notes: Couldn't resist.</p>
