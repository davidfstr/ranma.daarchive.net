</div><p>Chapter 5</p><p>'Be her friend'</p><p>Noriko was just putting on her nightgown when there was a knock on the door. She grabbed a matching robe and threw it on and walked to the door. "Who is it?" She asked.</p><p>"It's Yoshi." Came a familiar voice.</p><p>A grin came to Noriko''s face. She opened the door and posed against the doorway. "Yoshi." She said in pleased greeting. Then she pouted. "I'd invite you in but I'm expecting Ms. Kuno."</p><p>"Dressed like that?" Yoshi asled dubiously.</p><p>"What did you expect? Flannel pajamas?" Noriko laughed. "Oh don't look at me like that." She said as a frown formed on his face. "This is how I normally dress for bed."</p><p>"My apologies." Yoshi said seriously. "Actually I think My lady will approve."</p><p>"My Lady." Noriko echoed. "You mean it when you say it." She sighed. "I envy you that." Noriko said wistfully. She became aware of the strange look she was getting from Yoshi. "What?"</p><p>"Come with me Ms Mata." Yoshi said in suddenly formal tones. "There are some people who wish to speak to you." He turned and started walking.</p><p>"People?" Noriko asked. "What people?" Yoshi continued walking. Noriko chased after him. "What people Yoshi?" She demanded.</p><p>"You'll see when we get there." Yoshi promised.</p><p>Noriko stopped. "I'm not going any further until you tell me what's going on?" Noriko demanded.</p><p>Yoshi continued walking. "If you truly love My Lady you will follow."</p><p>"Love?" Demanded Noriko. She hurried after Yoshi. "Who said anything about love?" Unthinkingly she followed Yoshi along the long corridor. "I didn't say I loved her."</p><p>Yoshi paused at a door. "If that is true then return to your room and enjoy the rest of your weekend." He said in formal tones. "Only those who love My Lady may enter."</p><p>"Only those who,?" Noriko looked at the door. "Do you love her?" She asked as she stared at the door.</p><p>"Of course." Yoshi replied. "She is My Lady."</p><p>Noriko licked suddenly dry lips. "My Lady." She echoed. Noriko slid open the door. Hesitantly she walked into the darkened room. The room became even darker as the door closed behind her. She stepped forward then stopped as a pale blue light appeared around her. Forming a dim circle of light in the darkness.</p><p>"Noriko Mata." A gravelly voice echoed in the darkened room.</p><p>"Wh-who's there?" She said in a voice hoarse with nervousness.</p><p>"Noriko Mata." The voice repeated.</p><p>"Yes, yes I'm Noriko Mata." Noriko snapped.</p><p>"Why are you here?" Intoned the voice.</p><p>"Why?" Noriko voice became angry. "Why?" She repeated. "I was told I was supposed to come here if I loved Kodachi Kuno."</p><p>"Who?" There was a dangerous tone to the voice.</p><p>"Ko." Noriko stopped. "Oh gods." She whispered as realization came to her. She licked her lips again. "I was told I was supposed to come here if I loved My Lady." She choked out.</p><p>"And do you?" The voice was approving now.</p><p>"Yes." Whispered Noriko.</p><p>"Would you fight for her?" Asked the voice.</p><p>"Yes." Noriko replied. "At her side. That's why I train. So I can." She said defiantly.</p><p>"Would you die for her?" The voice asked. "Do not answer lightly."</p><p>Noriko was silent for a long moment. "I don't know." Noriko whispered finally. "I'm afraid to die." Noriko trembled in fear. Unsure of what was happening.</p><p>"As are we all." The voice said soothingly. "Would you die for her?" The voice repeated. Noriko was silent. "Would you die for her?" The voice demanded.</p><p>"I don't know." Shouted Noriko. "And even if I said yes, why should you believe me?" Noriko half sobbed half screamed. "I'm just a whore. I have no honor. I'm a whore." She screamed. "Gods you don't know how much I wish I could just say yes. You don't know how much I want to say yes." Noriko sank to the floor. "I have no honor." She sobbed.</p><p>"No honor?" The voice asked in an amused tone. "If you had no honor you would have said yes thoughtlessly, easily." The voice said. "And you would have been given the chance to prove it." The voice said the last coldly. There was the sound of metal hitting the floor and a blade landed in front of Noriko. "That's what you would have been given if you had said yes." The voice chuckled. "Instead you did your best to convince me that you wouldn't, couldn't say yes. No honor indeed."</p><p>Noriko looked at the blade. "That's not honor, that's cowardice." She protested.</p><p>"Honor I say." The voice was gentle now. "Noriko Mata."</p><p>Noriko looked toward the voice. "Yes?" Her voice trembled.</p><p>"Your Lady will be expecting you in your suite." The voice said. "It would be good if you were there." Noriko got to her feet. "I understand Your Lady has asked that you refer to her as Kodachi. Do so." The voice continued. "Though she really likes being called Dachi." There was a pause. "Remember; be her friend. She needs a friend."</p><p>Trembling Noriko backed away until she hit the door. She turned and scrambled at the door handle until the door opened. Yoshi was waiting. Without even acknowledging his existance, Noriko ran down the hall and back to her room. She was stopped by powerful arms before she opened the suite door. Noriko was spun around and found herself facing Yoshi. "Let me go." Noriko demanded in fright</p><p>"Not until you hear what I have to say." Yoshi replied calmly. "I think you don't fully understand the honor given you." He said. "You are the first outsider accepted as a retainer in over fifty years. Think on that." He released her. To Noriko's surprise he bowed deeply. "Welcome Sister." He said. "Welcome Noriko of the Kuno."</p><p>Noriko hesitantly returned the bow, turned and entered the suite. Shakily she went to the bathing area to wash her face and then returned to her vanity to repair her makeup. She was just finishing when there was a knock on the door. "That must be her." Noriko said. A smile lit her face as she raced to answer the door. 'Remember call her Kodachi.' She told herself. 'I don't think they want her to know.' She guessed. She opened the door. Kodachi stood there in night clothes that were very similar to Noriko's. "Kodachi." She said. "Come on in."</p><p>Kodachi held up a number of DVD cases. "I wasn't sure what you liked to watch." She explained. "So I brought some of my favorites." She said. "I hope you like them." Standing behind Kodachi was a woman with a serving cart. "I think I had enough popcorn for today." Kodachi said with a giggle. "But," She stopped. "Is something wrong Noriko?" She asked in concern. "You seem flushed." Kodachi placed the movie cases on the serving cart.</p><p>"No. No, I'm fine." Noriko said hurriedly. She forced a laugh. "I think you're right about too much popcorn." She said in explanation. She looked at the serving cart. "Please tell me there is more champagne though."</p><p>Kodachi laughed. "Of course." She swept into the room, followed by the woman with the cart. As the woman passed her she gave Noriko a bow and a wink. "if you need anything, ask for Yuki." The woman said quietly as she passed. "Sister."</p><p>"Th-thank you." Noriko replied. The woman nodded and pushed the cart into the room. "Will there be anything else, My Lady." Yuki asked politely. At Kodachi's no, Yuki walked out leaving the cart behind. "Alone at last." Noriko said with a shaky laugh.</p><p>Kodachi joined her in laughing. "Indeed." She said in agreement. "Not that one is truly alone here." She said grumpily. She waved a hand toward the ceiling. "I think you should be aware that every room in the mansion can be monitored." She said. "I asked them not to pry but one never knows."</p><p>"You mean someone is always listening?" Noriko said in horror.</p><p>"Or watching." Kodachi sighed. "It's for my own protection." She said. 'And once to teach me a lesson.' She thought in rememberance.</p><p>"That may be true but," Noriko shook herself. "Nevermind, if you can stand it, I can stand it." She declared. She stared at the ceiling. "Yuck."</p><p>"I agree Yuck." Kodachi shrugged. "The price of being wealthy." She said. "Or rather, the price for being a Kuno." She walked over to the rolling bar and poured two glasses of champagne. "I feel like getting drunk tonight."</p><p>"Good idea." Noriko took the drink. "I knew there was a reason you were the boss." She raised the glass to Kodachi. "To friends." She said in toast.</p><p>"To friends." Kodachi replied. They both took a large swallow. Kodachi refilled their glasses. "Movie?"</p><p>"What'cha got?" Noriko walked over to the cart and started looking at the titles. "Hey, what's this one?" She held up a unmarked case. She opened it. "Nothing written on it."</p><p>"Odd." Kodachi looked at the case. "I don't remember putting that there." She took the case from Noriko. "I think my Brother wants to tell me something." She said musingly.</p><p>"What's your Brother have to do with that?" She asked. "You probably picked it up by accident."</p><p>"In this household? Oh ho ho ho." Kodachi laughed, though truth be told the laugh was a quiet shadow of its' former manifestation. "You have much to learn about the Kuno." She declared. "There are few accidents here." She handed the case to Noriko. "Go ahead , play it."</p><p>"It's probably pictures from your last birthday." Noriko said. She walked over to a cabinet and opened it to reveal the wide screen tv and an audio sound system few could imagine. When Noriko discovered it the first time she had just sat and stared at it in awe for nearly an hour before she even turned it on. Now familiarity took away the awe but none of the pleasure. She inserted the disk into the player and turned on the tv.</p><p>Noriko walked to where Kodachi had already seated herself on a love seat. Noriko raised the remote and pressed the play button. After a moment the image of Tatewaki Kuno came on the screen. "Good evening sister." Tatewaki's image said. "And good evening to you as well Ms Mata."</p><p>"What the?" Noriko began only to be stopped by a touch on the arm by Kodachi. Noriko nodded and sat back.</p><p>"...My Ladies Nabiki and Kimi send their fond regards as well." Tatewaki continued. "Forgive the theatrics Sister but I didn't want to interrupt your," He smiled. "Sleep over." A satisfied look appeared on his face. "I just want you to know that it does my heart good to see you smile again."</p><p>"Thank you Brother." Kodachi whispered. Noriko moved closer and put a comforting arm around her shoulder. Kodachi leaned against Noriko.</p><p>"I have made it clear that you and Ms Mata are not to be discomfited in any manner." He said. "I want you both to enjoy this weekend." Tatewaki sighed. "You may drive any of the cars you wish." He said. "Do try not to dent the Maserati." His voice was filled with resignation.</p><p>Kodachi giggled. "I'll tell you later." She promised in a whisper.</p><p>"Again enjoy your weekend Sister." Tatewaki seemed to look directly at Noriko. "And you too Ms. Mata. Consider the Kuno mansion your home." The image froze.</p><p>"That must be it." Kodachi said quietly.</p><p>"Yeah." Noriko pressed a button and the image vanished from the large screen. She leaned back against the sofa. Her arm still around Kodachi's shoulders. "Whoa." She said in awe. "He looked like he was looking straight at me." Noriko suddenly realized where her arm was and pulled it away. "Sorry." She said in embarrassment.</p><p>"Why?" Kodachi asked. "It felt nice."</p><p>"Yeah, but it could lead someplace maybe we shouldn't go." Noriko said in regretful tones. Suddenly she laughed. "Listen to me; if you were Ky we'd already be in bed." Noriko clapped a hand over her mouth. "Oh Ms. Kuno. I didn't mean." She made to pull away but Kodachi stopped her.</p><p>"It's okay Noriko, I already figured that out." She laughed. "You even told me once; you told me all the girls sleep with the boss." She nudged Noriko. "And it's still Kodachi." She giggled. "In a way I have to thank you and the girls. Ky was an excellent lover."</p><p>Noriko laughed. "Yeah. Though I think you give us too much credit." She said. Norko turned to look at Kodachi more fully. "It's not that I don't want to Kodachi." She said seriously. "The gods know I think about it more than I should."</p><p>"Do you?" Interrupted Kodachi.</p><p>Noriko nodded. "Yeah." She said. "You're so beautiful, so graceful. A girl would have to be made out of stone not to want you." Noriko sighed. "I'm afraid."</p><p>"Afraid?" Kodacih asked in confusion. "I thought you've been with a woman before."</p><p>"I have." Noriko replied with a touch of annoyance. "That's not what I'm afraid of, I'm afraid if we become lovers it will affect how we work together."</p><p>"There is that." Kodachi agreed. "You think I'm beautiful?"</p><p>"You'd have to be blind not to." Returned Noriko. "If you were one of the girls you'd have men lining up." Noriko snorted in amusement. "Did you know that every time you'd come out of your office someone would ask me, not you mind, ask me what you charged. I think they were too afraid to ask you directly."</p><p>"How could they tell?" Kodachi asked. She snuggled closer to Noriko. "I wear a veil."</p><p>"Kodachi Kuno." Noriko retorted. "You could wear a burlap sack and men would still fall over themselves for the opportunity." She placed her arm back around Kodachi's shoulders. "Hell Kodachi half the girls would too." She said. "What am I saying? There isn't a single girl who doesn't wish she were me right now. And we haven't done anything yet." She grumped. Kodachi giggled.</p><p>"I have a question." Kodachi said. "How much did you tell them I charged?"</p><p>"I told them if they had to ask, they couldn't afford you." Noriko replied. "They usually nodded and walked away."</p><p>Kodach started laughing deeply. "Oh ho ho ho. You told them that?" Kodachi doubled over with laughter. "Nod and walk away." She gasped. "Oh ho ho ho." She rolled off the sofa and started rolling on the floor.</p><p>Noriko smiled in pleasure as Kodachi laughed. 'If anyone deserves to be happy, you do.' Noriko thought. 'My Lady.' Noriko waited until Kodachi wound down to catch her breath before reaching out with her hand. Kodachi took it and Noriko pulled Kodachi back on the sofa. "Weren't we planning on getting drunk tonight?" Noriko asked slyly.</p><p>"So we were." Kodachi nodded. She made to stand but was stopped by Noriko.</p><p>"Let me." Noriko said. She jumped up and quickly filled two glasses and returned to the sofa with the bottle. "Here you go." She raised the glass. "Well we already toasted to friendship." She said. "What should we drink to this time?" She asked. "I know." She raised her glass. "To Ky Young Ji." She said formally. "The only man worthy of Kodachi Kuno."</p><p>Kodachi wiped at her eyes. "Thank you Noriko." She raised her glass. "To Ky." She said quietly. She and Noriko downed their champagne. Kodachi held out her glass and Noriko refilled both their glasses. "My turn." She said. "To Ky's Cafe. Where we met." She raised her glass.</p><p>"I'll definitly drink to that." Noriko declared. They downed their drinks. "We better slow down." Noriko said as she placed her glass on an end table. "I want to get drunk, not sick."</p><p>"That's one of the things I like about you Noriko." Kodachi said. "You think ahead." She placed her glass on the end table next to her. Suddenly she frowned. "No one ever made an offer?" She asked with a touch of annoyance. "Not even a bad offer?"</p><p>"Well one gentlemen offered one hundred thousand yen." She admitted. "I laughed."</p><p>"You have got to tell me." Kodachi leaned forward. "What do you think I would be worth?" She giggled at Noriko's expression. "Please?" She begged cutely.</p><p>"For a night or an hour?" Noriko asked. "Though if I were you, I'd never consent to only an hour." She said. "It would be a weekend or nothing." She said firmly. "Being an escort, that's where the real money is."</p><p>"Indeed?" Kodachi sat back and tapped her chin musingly. "Do you think we should move in that direction?" She asked seriously.</p><p>"I would." Noriko said firmly. "As much as we can anyway." She added. "We're definitely going to need more girls."</p><p>"I will speak to the Ice Queen." Kodachi said seriously. "She may have some ideas." She looked at Noriko. "You still haven't answered the question. Assuming a gentleman was willing to spend a weekend with me, what wouldn't you laugh at?"</p><p>Noriko shrugged. "Five hundred thousand yen?"</p><p>Kodachi sat back and looked at the ceiling. "Five hundred thousand yen." She said slowly as if tasting the sound. She nodded. "Yes, that seems to be an adequate amount." She and Noriko shared a giggle. Kodachi sighed happily.</p><p>"I think it's time for another drink." Noriko declared. She picked up the bottle.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Cook put down the headphones and flicked several switches on the console in front of him. "Remarkable." He said to himself. He turned in his chair. "About your orders Lord Kuno."<p>"No video, no sound recordings." Tatewaki replied firmly. "Let what happens, happen. There will be no interference."</p><p>"Yes My Lord." Cook said. He turned to the console and flicked several more switches. "Done My Lord." He turned. "If I may venture an opinion My Lord?" Tatewaki waved him on. "Ms Mata is a young woman who I believe was born to serve."</p><p>Tatewaki nodded. "So My Lady Kimi has already surmised."</p><p>Cook smiled. "Now there is a woman who was born to lead." He said in admiration. "A fitting consort to a Kuno."</p><p>Tatewaki smiled proudly. "She is indeed." Tatewaki said. "And a fitting companion to my Lady Nabiki."</p><p>"My Lord is most fortunate." Cook said seriously. "Though we do have one concern." He said. "My Lord needs an heir."</p><p>"In due time Cook." Tatewaki promised. "In due time." He clapped Cook on the shoulder. "Fear not, there will be an heir." He said heartily. "Now I must return to My Ladies." He smiled, turned and walked out of the small room.</p><p>Cook turned in his seat and flicked several switched. The monitors returned to life and Cook watched Tatewaki walk through the corridor and out of the mansion. Cook waited until Tatewaki's car pulled away before shutting down the monitors again. He stood and walked out of the room and locked it behind him.</p><p>Cook walked back to the kitchen, turning off lights as he went. As expected Yoshi and Yuki were waiting. "There will be no observation." He announced. He smiled at the looks of relief on the two's faces. "However, I think it would be prudent if the two of you would attend to their needs for the weekend."</p><p>"It would be an honor Cook." Yoshi replied. Yuki murmurred a firm agreement.</p><p>"Excellent." Cook replied.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Whoo." Kodachi said. She raised her hand to her head. "I think I'm getting tipsy."<p>"Well you did say you wanted to get drunk." Noriko took the glass from Kodachi's hand and placed it on the table next to her. "If you were a man, I'd be giving you a massage right now."</p><p>"Oh a massage sounds nice." Kodachi said. "But we don't have a massage table."</p><p>Noriko smiled. "No, but we have a very big bed and I brought some really nice massage oil." She said. Noriko extended a hand and when Kodachi took it she pulled Kodachi to her feet. "Come along Kodachi. It's time to go to bed."</p><p>"Oh I was wondering when this would happen." Kodachi weaved slightly as Noriko led her to the bed. "I think I need one more teensy drink." She said.</p><p>"I think you had enough." Noriko giggled.</p><p>"Please." Kodachi begged.</p><p>"Lie down first." Noriko said gently. "Get comfortable." Noriko went back to the sofa and picked up Kodachi's glass. 'Maybe half a glass.' She thought. She smiled to herself. 'I'm Kodachi Kuno's number one girl.' She looked over her shoulder. Kodachi had removed her nightgown and lay face down in just panties. Noriko licked her lips in anticipation. 'I will be your friend My Lady, the Gods know you need one.' She thought as she walked back to the bed. "Here." She said. Kodachi rose up on her elbow and accepted the drink. Kodachi downed the drink and handed the glass back to Noriko. Noriko placed the glass on a convenient table and started to remove her nightgown. 'And I will be your lover. For as long as you want me.' Noriko picked up the bottle of massage oil she had placed on the side of the bed.</p><p>Noriko straddled Kodachi and sat lightly on the small of her back. "I'll have you know my former regulars always enjoyed my massages." She pour a little oil on the palm of one hand and then rubbed her palms together.</p><p>"Did they?" Kodachi murmurred. Kodachi had had massages many times before. And some of the masseusses were world famous. She had been prepared for a sensual but amature performance. Kodachi was totally unprepared for her reaction to Noriko's first touch and she knew instinctively that it was a lover's touch. It seemed to Kodachi that Noriko was memorizing her body through her hands. "Oh." Kodachi sighed. "Former regulars?" She asked quietly when she regained her composure.</p><p>Noriko leaned forward until her mouth was next to Kodachi's ear and breathed hotly. Noriko smiled as she felt Kodachi squirm under her. "Well I am your number one girl aren't I?" She asked. Kodachi nodded. "That means I don't sleep with anyone you don't want me to."</p><p>Kodachi raised up. "Does that include Yoshi?" She asked seriously. "I'm sorry Noriko but." Kodachi felt herself pushed back down.</p><p>"That includes Yoshi." Noriko said as she continued her massage. "Did you watch?" Noriko asked. Kodachi nodded. "Why?" Noriko slid down and started massaging the small of Kodachi's back.</p><p>"I don't know." Kodachi whispered. "I erased the recording." She said in the same quiet voice. Kodachi licked her lips. "I, I don't." Kodachi stopped. "Did he make you happy?"</p><p>"Yoshi is a lot of fun." Noriko said. "And not a bad lover." She slid down lower. "Why are you still wearing these?" Noriko complained. She grasped the edges of Kodachi's panties and pulled them slowly off. "Much better."</p><p>"For you or for me?" Kodachi asked with a hint of humor in her voice.</p><p>"The answer to that question is 'yes'." Noriko giggled. "If you want me to stop seeing Yoshi, I'll stop seeing Yoshi." Noriko continued. "It's that simple." Noriko got off Kodachi's legs. "Roll over." She said. Noriko watched Kodachi roll over in hungry anticipation. "Gods you're beautiful." Noriko breathed.</p><p>Noriko lay down next to Kodachi and started tracing the outline of Kodachi's breasts with a finger. Her finger brushed against the bullet that hung between Kodachi's breasts. Noriko cupped the bullet in her hand and looked at it. 'You were standing right next to him.' She thought. Noriko placed the bullet reverently between Kodachi's breasts. She looked at Kodachi. "You're so beautiful." Noriko whispered again.</p><p>"So are you." Kodachi whispered back breathlessly. "I-I don't know what to do." She said hesitantly.</p><p>"I do." Noriko replied quietly. "Let me show you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi opened her eyes slowly. 'This is not my room.' She thought muzzily. She became aware of an arm around her waist and a warm body pressed against her side. "Who?"<p>"Morning." Noriko's whispered sleepily.</p><p>"Oh Noriko." Kodachi relaxed or tried to. "Oh my head." She moaned.</p><p>Noriko giggled. "I told you not to have that last glass." She sat up. "Whoa." She blinked. "Maybe I shouldn't have had that last glass either." She smiled at Kodachi's giggle. Noriko stretched. "Bathroom." She decided.</p><p>"You had to say that, I was trying to ignore it." Kodachi sat up. "Oh well." She threw off the bed clothes and grabbed her robe. Noriko was barely a beat behind her. The two woman performed their morning ablutions. "What would you like for breakfast?" Kodachi asked a little later as Noriko washed her back.</p><p>"Something expensive." Noriko said. She rinsed Kodachi's back. "And a pot of coffee."</p><p>"How can you drink that stuff?" Kodachi asked. "Turn around. I'll wash your back."</p><p>"An acquired taste girlfriend." Noriko replied. "Oh that feels good. I don't remember the last time anyone washed my back." She giggled. "You're going to spoil me Kodachi Kuno."</p><p>"Oh good." Kodachi giggled. "Then we'll both be spoiled." She said. "Though I am a teensy bit mad at you." Kodachi continued. "Taking advantage of me like that." She wrapped her arms around Noriko from behind. "And there I was all drunk and helpless and unable to fend you off."</p><p>"Uh huh." Noriko snickered. "Drunk maybe, helpless never." She said. "And if I remember correctly I wasn't the one who kept yelling don't stop, don't stop." She and Kodachi shared another giggle. "Was it what you expected?" Noriko asked.</p><p>"I don't know what I expected." Kodachi laid her cheek against Noriko's back. "But it was all I hoped for." She stayed like that for a long moment . "Now." Kodachi said briskly, she stood. "Let's see about that expensive breakfast." She said.</p><p>With Noriko following quickly the two walked naked back into Noriko's bedroom. Kodachi went to plate attached to the wall. "You press this button." Kodachi pressed a button. "Breakfast for two in Miss Mata's suite." She said. "Miss Mata has requested something expensive."</p><p>"Of course Miss Kuno." A voice came from the plate.</p><p>"And a pot of coffee." Noriko said loudly.</p><p>"French or Italian Roast?" Came the voice. "We have some very fine Sumatran as well."</p><p>"Is Sumatran expensive?" Noriko asked Kodachi. Kodachi nodded. "Oh the Sumatran then, of course." Noriko giggled.</p><p>"Of course." Kodachi echoed. "And a change of clothes for myself. Miss Mata and I are going shopping." She grinned. "We'll be taking the Maseratii."</p><p>"It's already in the driveway Miss Kuno." Replied the voice. "Give us a half hour."</p><p>"Excellent." Kodachi walked back to Noriko. "So what should we do for a half hour?" She asked.</p><p>Noriko put her arm around Kodachi's waist and led her back to the bed. "Oh I can think of a thing or two." Noriko said. She pushed Kodachi on to the bed. Noriko lay down next to Kodachi. "You can't claim being drunk this time you know." She said as she began to kiss Kodachi's shoulder. Kodachi nodded. "Good." Noriko purred.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi parked the Maserati and she and Noriko exited. Noriko looped her arm through Kodachi's. "So where would you like to go next?" Kodachi asked. So far Kodachi had bought Noriko a completely new outfit, including shoes and matching jewelry.<p>"We could go back to the mansion and fool around some more." Noriko said cheerfully.</p><p>"Noriko." Kodachi said in scandalized tones. She giggled. "Later." She promised. There was a beeping from her purse. "Oh bother." She fished her cell phone from her purse. "Kodachi Kuno." She said shortly into the mouthpiece. "Koko?" She said in surprise. "Whatever is the matter? Kiko? What's wrong with Kiko?" She demanded. "What do you mean she was in a fight in school?"</p><p>"Back to the car." Noriko turned Kodachi around and they headed toward the Maserati. "Give me the keys." She ordered. "I'll drive." Kodachi handed the keys to Noriko and got in the passenger side. They drove off. "Tell Koko we're on the way." Noriko expertly drove the sports car through the narrow streets.</p><p>"I can't believe Kiko was in a fight." Kodachi said in disbelief and anger. "What has come over her?"</p><p>"We'll find out when we get there." Noriko said soothingly. "I can't believe she was in a fight either." Noriko drove while Kodachi fretted. Finally they arrived at the school Kiko attended. No sooner had Noriko had parked the car then Kodachi was out and running toward the entrance. Noriko caught up with her just as she reached the Principal's office. Koko jumped up as Kodachi entered.</p><p>"Ms Kuno." Koko said in relief. "Thank you for coming."</p><p>"Koko." Kodachi said. "What in the name of all the gods is going on?"</p><p>"I don't know." Koko said worriedly. "They wanted you here before they said anything."</p><p>"Me?" Kodachi said in surprise. She turned as the door to the Principal's office opened and the Principal opened it. She was a short, stocky woman with steel gray hair tied into a tight bun. "Mrs Kobiashi? Ms Kuno?" The principal asked. "I am Principal Akahito." She introduced herself. "Please come in." The Principal noticed Noriko as she followed Kodachi. "And you are?"</p><p>"This is Noriko Mata." Kodachi said. "My aide and companion." She looked at the Principal. "She goes wherever I go."</p><p>The Principal nodded. "Irregular but under the circumstances I think," She waved her hand. "Come along." She turned and opened the door. Kodachi, Koko and Noriko entered the office. Kiko, in her school uniform, sat in a chair. Her entire body radiated defiance. She looked up as the door opened.</p><p>"Mommy!" Kiko jumped out of her chair and over to her mother. Koko gathered Kiko up in her arms. "They were saying bad things about you and Auntie Dachi mommy." Babbled the little girl.</p><p>"What is she talking about?" Kodachi asked the principal.</p><p>"Apparently some of Kiko's schoolmates made some unkind comments about you and Mrs Kobiashi and Miss Kobiashi decided to let her fists do the talking." She looked at Kodachi. "Someone has been teaching her martial arts." She accused. Kodachi smiled slightly. "I am not going to have the same nonsense here as there was at Saint Hebereke and Furinken. Oh yes, I know all about your antics." The Principal said sternly. "If she can't learn to keep her temper then we will have no recourse but to expel her."</p><p>"Expel her then." Kodachi snapped. "If you can't teach your students to keep a civil tongue in their mouths then maybe Kiko doesn't belong here."</p><p>"You tell'er Auntie Dachi." Kiko cheered. "They called mommy ugly."</p><p>"Did they?" Kodachi said dangerously.</p><p>Kiko nodded with rightous affront. "And they said all Kunos were crazy." Kiko balled her tiny fists. "No one talks like that about my Mommy and my auntie."</p><p>"I've heard enough." Kodachi growled. "Noriko. Please make arrangements to provide a private tutor for Kiko."</p><p>"Of course Ms Kuno." Noriko found herself falling comfortably back into her normal role as Kodachi's aide. 'So much for worrying if being lovers will affect how we work together.' Noriko thought in satisfaction. Noriko pulled out her cell phone and punched in a number. "Yoshi?" She said. "Where are you?" Her eyebrows raised. "What are you doing there?" She asked. "Never mind, Mrs Kobiashi and Kiko need a ride home." She stopped at a touch on her arm. She looked into Kodachi's eyes. "My mistake." She said. "Mrs. Kobiashi and Kiko will be joining us for dinner." She said while looking into Kodachi's eyes. "And they will be staying overnight."</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "Thank you." She turned to the Principal. "Is there anything else you wish to discuss? No?" She turned her back on the Principal. "Come along ladies." With Kodachi in the lead the three woman and one little girl strode out of the Principal's office and out of the school. As they exited the school grounds a car pulled up. The door opened and Yuki stepped out.</p><p>"Yoshi and I will bring Mrs Kobiashi and Miss Kiko to the mansion." Yuki said.</p><p>"Tell cook Kiko's to have Ice Cream." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Of course My Lady." Yuki closed the door and reentered the car. The car drove away.</p><p>Kodachi sighed. "Well I'm afraid we are going to have to cut our shopping trip short." Kodachi said apologetically. "I hope you aren't too upset."</p><p>"Upset? I would have been upset if you ignored Kiko." Noriko said firmly. "That little girl needed her Auntie Dachi." Noriko leaned forward and gave Kodachi a quick kiss on the cheek. "I'm proud of you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi and Noriko parked the Maserati. With Kodachi in the lead the two women hurried into the mansion. Yoshi was waiting for them at the door. "Miss Kiko is in the kitchen having ice cream and we've put Mrs. Kobiashi into a suite in the east wing."<p>"Excellent." Kodachi said. "Noriko would you please see that Koko is properly settled?"</p><p>"Of course Ms Kuno." Noriko said. She smiled to herself as Kodachi hurried toward the kitchen. "We wont be seeing either one of them until dinner." She murmured.</p><p>"Probably not." Agreed Yoshi. "Do you mind?"</p><p>"Of course not." Noriko said. "That little girl needs her Auntie Dachi and Ms Kuno needs to be Auntie Dachi." She said firmly. "Now how about taking me to Koko?" She said.</p><p>Yoshi started walking and Noriko matched his pace. "I was surprised you called her Ms Kuno." Yoshi commented. "I thought you were to call her Kodachi."</p><p>"She was being Ms Kuno." Noriko said matter of factly. "I'll call her Kodachi when she's being Kodachi." She looked at Yoshi. "Why? Do you think I'm wrong?"</p><p>"No." Admitted Yoshi. "I think you handled that perfectly." He smiled at Noriko. "Well done Ms Mata."</p><p>"Thank you Yoshi." Noriko said honestly. "Could you ask Yuki to bring some tea? I have a feeling Koko is half out of her mind right now."</p><p>"Already on the way." Yoshi replied. He stopped at a door. "We put them in here." He said. "We thought it best they be put far enough away to ensure some modicum of privacy for you and Miss Kuno."</p><p>Noriko looked curiously at Yoshi. "You know." She said finally.</p><p>"We know Ms Mata." Yoshi replied. "You make her happy. We can forgive most anything because of that." He bowed. "I'll leave Mrs Kobiashi in your capable hands." Yoshi bowed again and left.</p><p>Noriko looked at Yoshi's retreating back then turned back to the door. She knocked. The door opened and Koko stood in the doorway. "Noriko." Koko said in relief. "Please, please come in."</p><p>Noriko entered the suite. "Not bad." She said as she took in the suite.</p><p>"It's too much." Koko said nervously. "Oh Noriko how am I supposed to pay for a tutor?"</p><p>"You don't." Noriko replied. "Ms Kuno will do that." She raised a hand. "Let her do this Koko." She said firmly. "For Kiko"</p><p>"But." Koko protested. "A tutor is expensive."</p><p>"Koko Kobiashi." Noriko scolded in an amused tone. "Do you really think money is important to Ms Kuno?" She asked. "No, What is important to Ms Kuno is Kiko." She pointed a finger at her chest. "And what is important to me is that Ms Kuno is happy. Kiko makes her happy." She looked at the door for a moment then turned back to Koko. "Let her do this Koko." She repeated.</p><p>There was a knock on the door. "That must be Yuki." Noriko said. She went to the door and opened it. It was Yuki. "Ah our tea." She said. "Thank you Yuki."</p><p>"My pleasure Ms Mata." Yuki pushed the cart into the room.</p><p>Noriko looked at the cart. "No extra video this time?" She asked.</p><p>"Not this time Ms Mata." Yuki dimpled a smile. "Miss Kuno asked me to tell you that dinner will be informal." She said. "Miss Kiko asked for hamburgers and french fries."</p><p>"Oh please don't go to any trouble." Koko began.</p><p>"Oh no trouble Mrs Kobiashi." Yuki replied. "Ms Kuno thought it was a wonderful idea." She bowed. "Dinner will be at seven." She said. "If you'll excuse me." Yuki left.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi shook an admonishing finger at the six year old Kiko. "You caused your mother a lot of trouble, you know."<p>"But they said bad things about her Auntie." Protested Kiko.</p><p>"I know." Kodachi replied. "And that is the only reason you are not being punished." Kodachi shook her head. "You must learn to control your temper." She leaned forward. "And there are other ways of defending your families honor. Better ways." She said conspiratorally.</p><p>"Like what Auntie?" Kiko asked in fascination.</p><p>"Well." Kodachi drawled. "There was the time I put itching powder in a rival's gym shorts." She giggled. "She ended pulling them off in the middle of class." Kiko giggled in delight. "Oh there are so many ways." Kodachi said. "While I do admit a good punch in the nose has it's charms a young lady must never stoop to mere violence."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Kiko said. "Auntie?"</p><p>"Yes Kiko?"</p><p>"You're not wearing your veil." Kiko stated. "Does that mean you don't cry anymore?" She asked.</p><p>"Not as much, no." Kodachi replied quietly.</p><p>"Good." Kiko replied in satisfaction. "You're too nice to be sad."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Noriko looked up at a knock on her suite door. "It's open." She called. To her pleasure Kodachi walked in.<p>"Noriko I was wondering," Kodachi trailed off. "You're packing." She said in a quiet voice.</p><p>Noriko sighed. "Yeah, the weekend went so fast." She said in slightly sad tones. "Too fast." She looked up at a slight whimper coming from Kodachi. "Kodachi?"</p><p>"I thought you liked it here?" Kodachi said in a small voice.</p><p>"Of course I like it here." Noriko said.</p><p>"Then why are you packing?" Kodachi asked. "Wouldn't you rather stay here?"</p><p>"You want me to move in?" Noriko asked in disbelief. Kodachi nodded. "Not that I'd say no; but are you sure?" Kodachi nodded again. Noriko looked around the room. "Will you be staying here as well?"</p><p>"I think that would be too great an imposition on you." Kodachi said. "You may wish," Kodachi chewed her lip. "Other company."</p><p>Noriko chuckled. "You mean men." She said. Kodachi nodded. "I told you, I won't sleep with anyone you don't want me to." She said. Noriko walked over to Kodachi and looked into her eyes. "I meant it then and I mean it now. I'm here for you. Not Yoshi, not even me. You." She smiled. "That's what being number one girl means."</p><p>"Do you mean if I told you to sleep with, oh Tokio Wasuhara, for example?" Kodachi ventured slowly. Noriko nodded. "Even him?" Kodachi asked in disbelief. Noriko continued to nod. "Why?"</p><p>Noriko shook her head and put her arms around Kodachi's waist. "You mean you haven't figured it out yet?" Noriko asked. "Because I love you Kodachi." She said quietly. "Not the way Ky loved you but in my own way. A whore's way." She placed a hand over Kodachi's mouth to stop the expected protest. "You own me Kodachi Kuno. Body and soul. What you want me to do, I'll do and I'll do it happily, gladly." She said. "For you."</p><p>End Chapter 5</p><p>Author's Notes: Actually nothing to say.
