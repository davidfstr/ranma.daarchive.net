</div><p>Chapter 3</p><p>'An invitation'</p><p>Kyoshi Narumi walked down the darkened streets of the part of Tokyo he claimed as his own. At thirty his intelligence and willingness to resort to, what he called, limited violence made him a powerful figure among the Yakusa. Or did until Hikaru Nakamura started interfering. "Damn Nakamura." He growled under his breath.</p><p>"Don't like Nakamura huh?" Came a masculine voice. Narumi spun around. No one was there. Narumi reached slowly into his coat. His hand closed on the comforting presence of a large knife. "Who's there?" He hissed. "Someone who dislikes Nakamura even more than you." The voice answered. To Kyoshi's astonishment a powerfully built young man seemed to materialize in front of him. The man raised his hands to show they were empty.</p><p>"What do you want?' Asked Kyoshi.</p><p>The man reached slowly into his shirt pocket and extracted an envelope. "I have an invitation for you." The man said.</p><p>"From who?" Kyoshi asked suspiciously. He looked at the invitation but didn't take it.</p><p>"From someone who hates Nakamura even more than you do." The man reached behind him and grabbed a long pigtail. "From the only person who has a chance of challenging him."</p><p>"Challenge him?" Kyoshi said in disbelief. "Are you crazy?"</p><p>The man raised a hand. Actinic energy danced across his finger tips. "No." The man said simply. He clenched his hand and the glow intensified. "And neither is she."</p><p>"She?" The man's eyes widened. He grabbed the invitation. "If it's who I think it is, I'm in." He said. "Cold hearted bitch, right?"</p><p>The man smiled. "We call her the Ice Queen." The glow disappeared from his hand. "The time and place is on the invitation. You can bring two body guards." He leaped into the air and vanished into the shadows.</p><p>Kyoshi looked at the invitation. He brought it to his nose. There was a faint scent of perfume. "Ice Queen." He chuckled. "So we finally get to meet."</p><p>Ranma returned to the roof where Akane and Ukyo waited. They looked down as Kyoshi Narumi walked quickly away. "He was the last one."</p><p>"What if one of them goes to Nakamura?" Akane asked worriedly. "I know Nabiki thinks she's picked all the ones most likely to resist Nakamura, but what if she's wrong?"</p><p>"That's where we come in sugar." Ukyo said grimly.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane stared into the night sky. "But there's still only three of us." She snorted. "And I'm not forgetting Kuno, I'm ignoring him." She shivered. "Maybe we can find Ryoga."</p><p>"I don't think that'd be a good idea sugar." Ukyo said slowly. She looked at Ranma she frowned when Ranma shook his head.</p><p>"I don't understand what you have against Ryoga." Akane replied. "I mean, you used to date him."</p><p>"It wasn't really dating." Ukyo corrected. "Nothing serious anyway, but, well no offense but Ryoga creeps me out sometimes."</p><p>Akane nodded. "Yeah, there's something about him, isn't there?" She shrugged. "Okay, no Ryoga."</p><p>Ukyo nodded. "How about Ryu? Or Konatsu?" She raised her hand. "Yeah, he's a flake but he's damn good."</p><p>"I always thought you and Konatsu would get together." Akane muttered. "You both are damn good cross-dressers."</p><p>"Yeah, maybe. I had the wrong equipment sugar." Ukyo laughed ironically. "Konatsu really did think he was a girl. Even after he learned the truth he still was attracted to men." She grinned wryly. "At least Ranma switch hits."</p><p>"Hey I've never done it with a guy." Ranma protested.</p><p>"Yeah but you would if you really wanted to." Akane said quietly. "Right Big Daddy?"</p><p>Ukyo chuckled. "She got you there Ran-chan." She said. "Right?"</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Probably. I just haven't wanted to." He said. "I do like to at least care about who I sleep with." Ranma said primly. "I may be a slut sometimes but I'm a picky slut."</p><p>Despite her moodiness Akane chuckled. She stood. "Let's go home."</p><p>They ran along the rooftops and quickly reached their apartment. They unlocked the door and deactivated the alarm system. "Who wants a drink?" Ranma said as he walked over to a cabinet.</p><p>"What are you having sugar?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"J&amp;B on the rocks." Ranma replied.</p><p>"Make me one." Ukyo replied. "Akane?"</p><p>"Just a short one." Akane replied. She sat down on the couch next to Ukyo and curled her legs up. She held her hand out as Ranma handed her a drink. Ranma gave Ukyo her drink and walked back to the bar and fixed himself his own drink. Ranma walked over and sat on the floor and leaned back against the couch. Ranma sighed.</p><p>"Tired Ran-chan?" Ukyo asked. She sipped her drink.</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "Nah. Just being a little, what's the word, you know thinking about the old days."</p><p>"Nostalgic." Akane replied. She stirred her drink with her finger. "Thinking about what?" She asked.</p><p>"Well, being too young to drink for one." He said wryly. He took a sip of his drink. "I dunno, it's not like life was easier when I first got here." He smiled at the snort of amusements that came from both Akane and Ukyo. "I dunno."</p><p>"I can't believe I was so stupid back then." Akane grumbled. "Stupid and angry at the world."</p><p>"You weren't the only one sugar." Ukyo replied. She grinned. "At least you're not so angry any more." Ukyo downed her drink. "Lighten up you two; what's done is done. We're still friends aren't we?" Ranma and Akane nodded. Though Akane's mouth twisted slightly. "In my book that puts us ahead of the rest."</p><p>"I see why you keep her around." Akane muttered to Ranma. Ranma chuckled. "That may be true Ukyo, but sometimes I wish I could go back and meet my younger self and beat some sense into her." Her hand reached over and started to play with Ranma's pigtail. She sighed. "That's always been my problem, hit first and ask questions later."</p><p>"I think someone needs a little extra attention." Ukyo cracked. "You wanna do the honors Ran-chan or should I?"</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "How about if I sleep in you guys' room tonight?" He winced when Akane hit him on the top of his head. "Your room is bigger, you know."</p><p>"What makes you so sure I want either of you?" Grumbled Akane. "I'm sure I could go out and find someone." She looked at Ukyo's knowing grin. "Oh who am I kidding?" She said in resignation. "I don't want anyone else."</p><p>"That's how we feel too sugar." Ukyo said firmly. Ranma nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Really?" Akane asked in a plaintive tone.</p><p>"Really Tomboy." Ranma replied. He stood up and stretched. He looked at Akane. "And that's one thing you can take as a given." He smiled at Akane. "Now who gets the shower first?"</p><p>Ranma woke early and untangled himself from the twin embraces of Akane and Ukyo. He eased himself out of the bed without waking the two girls and, after putting on a robe, pattered out to the kitchen. He quickly got the rice cooking and put water on for tea. Ranma bent over as he looked into the refrigerator. "Hmm." Ranma murmured. "We better go shopping soon. We're running out of just about everything." He took out some leftover mackerel and some pickled vegetables and brought them to the table. The rice had just finished cooking and the tea finished brewing when Akane and Ukyo staggered into the kitchen.</p><p>Akane sat down at the table. "Tea." She groaned. "Please tell me you made tea."</p><p>Ranma chuckled. "Here ya go Tomboy." He placed a mug in front of Akane. Then one in front of Ukyo. He waited until they both drank some tea before he placed a bowl of rice in front of them. "There's some mackerel left." He said.</p><p>"Thanks Ranma." Akane took a breath and released it slowly. "Thanks guys." She continued. "For last night. I think I needed it."</p><p>"Our pleasure sugar." Ukyo chuckled. "Literally." She took a sip of her tea. "Been awhile since the three of us slept together." She said thoughtfully. "Kind of missed it."</p><p>"And you guys call me a slut." Ranma said cheerfully.</p><p>"Well you are a slut Ranma." Akane said in a matching cheerful tone. "Good thing too." She joined in the general laughter. Akane stretched. "Damn I feel good this morning." She said. "What do we have planned for today?"</p><p>"Depends." Ranma replied. "Do we gotta work any more this week Uk-chan?"</p><p>Ukyo walked over to the cookie jar and reached in. She pulled out a bank book and a large wad of bills. "Not really." She said after a short calculation. "The bills are paid, we got money in the bank. To bad we have to deal with Hikaru or I'd say let's get out of town."</p><p>"Oh that would be so nice." Akane said wistfully. She shook herself. "Well if we can't get out of town why don't we do the next best thing? Who's up for a manicure and a facial? Maybe do a little shopping, while we're at it."</p><p>"Sounds good to me." Ranma replied. The phone rang. "I wonder who that is, this early?" He stood and walked over to the phone. "Hello?" Ranma smiled. "Hi Mom." He said. "Oh nothing much, the girls and I were thinking about going into town." Ranma listened then cupped his hand over the mouthpiece. "Mom wants to know if she and Konatsu can join us."</p><p>"Gonna cut down on a couple places I wanted to go check out but sure." Akane replied. "Ukyo?"</p><p>"Sure." Ukyo replied. "They going to come here or meet us?"</p><p>"Come here." Ranma replied. "Come on over Mom. We'll wait for you." He grinned. "Sure no problem. Love ya." He hung up. "Mom wanted to know if I'd mind being a girl." He told them.</p><p>"You're Mom still thinks you hate being a girl?" Ukyo asked. "After all this time?"</p><p>Ranma shook his head. "No. Mom knows I've gotten comfortable with my girl side. She just hasn't figured out that I really don't care which sex I am."</p><p>"Well I care." Akane mock grumped. "Toys are not as good as the real thing."</p><p>"I'll take your word for it." Ranma replied. "You guys clean up, okay?"</p><p>"Go ahead Ran-chan." Ukyo replied. "Just don't use up all the hot water</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>An attractive middle aged woman in traditional kimono and, what appeared to be, an attractive young woman wearing a blouse and skirt approached the apartment building. "Thank you for inviting me Madam Nodoka." Konatsu said happily. "It'll be good to see Miss Ukyo again."<p>"That was the general idea, Konatsu." Nodoka said calmly. She looked at Konatsu. The incident in the restaurant had taken a lot out of the Ninja. She suppressed a frown. 'A day with the girls is what he needs.' She thought. 'Maybe I'll ask Ranma to talk to him.' She smiled in anticipation as they approached the apartment door. She knocked. The door opened.</p><p>"Mom." Ranma exclaimed happily. Ranma, in female form, was wearing jeans and a tank top. "Hey Konatsu." She ushered her visitors into the apartment. Ukyo was sitting on the couch. She waved Konatsu over. "Akane'll be out in a minute. Have a seat." Ranma finished. "Let me get you some tea." Ranma ran off to the kitchen leaving her Mother to kneel down at the low table.</p><p>Konatsu sat on the couch next to Ukyo. Before the Ninja could say anything he was being hugged by Ukyo. "Hey sugar." Ukyo said happily. "You're looking good, as always."</p><p>"Thank you Miss Ukyo." Konatsu replied demurely. "Uk-chan's isn't the same without you."</p><p>"Konatsu has been a wonderful help at the restaurant." Nodoka informed Uk-chan. She gave Ukyo a questioning look. "Speaking of which, it was very good of you to let us use the restaurant but it is no longer necessary. Why haven't you reclaimed it?"</p><p>"Because of Ranma, Auntie." Ukyo said seriously. "It's my dowry." She raised her hand. "No I am not claiming anything. But neither can Akane."</p><p>"What happened," Nodoka swallowed. "She never said what happened. Was it that bad?" Her hand flew to her mouth at Ukyo's nod. "Oh." She gasped. "But, I don't understand. Why are either of you here then?"</p><p>"Penance." Ukyo replied. "Sort of. We both still love him and, well Ranma hasn't found anyone else." She said in sad tones. "Not yet anyway." Her smile matched her tone. "Maybe he never will but neither of us can ever claim him. But he hasn't asked us to leave either." She looked toward the kitchen. "Whatever he wants, as Akane says."</p><p>The door to the kitchen opened and Ranma walked out carrying a tea service. "Here we go." She said cheerfully. She brought the tray to the table and sat down next to her mother. She poured tea for her mother. Ranma looked around. "Where's the Tomboy?"</p><p>Ukyo stood. "I'll get her." She said. "Be right back." She walked to the door of the bedroom she shared with Akane. "Sugar?" She said as she opened the door. Akane was sitting on her futon cross-legged. Her hands in her lap. She was looking down. "You okay sugar?"</p><p>"What did you tell her?" Akane asked in a whisper.</p><p>"Just that it was bad." Ukyo replied. "And that neither of us has a claim on Ranma." She walked over to Akane. "You'll have to face her sugar." She knelt down. "Ranma won't let it get too hot. You know that."</p><p>Akane looked up. "I know." Akane said in a tight voice. "I almost wish he wouldn't." She stood. Ukyo followed. "Time to face the music." Akane said nervously. She walked slowly to the bedroom door. Akane hesitated for a moment then, with a deep breath, opened the door and walked into the main part of the apartment. Ukyo followed.</p><p>Akane walked over to the table. "Good morning A-auntie." Akane said to Nodoka hesitantly.</p><p>"Akane." Nodoka said in a stern voice. She eyed the young woman coldly for a moment. "You're not getting enough sleep." She said finally. She nodded at the spot next to Ranma. "Sit." She looked at Ukyo. "You too Ukyo." The two women sat. Nodoka sipped her tea as she regarded the two women for a moment. Then she turned to Ranma. "Thank you for waiting for us my son. I would like to discuss something before we go." She extracted the pictures of Konatsu and handed them to Ranma. "Someone is making trouble for Konatsu."</p><p>Ranma handed the pictures back. "Nabs called and told us." She replied. "She thinks its Gosunkugi. Sasuke has been looking for him. The fact that he can't be found sort of lends credence to Nabiki's hunch." She looked at Konatsu. "You okay?"</p><p>Konatsu nodded hesitantly. "Yes Miss Ranma." He sighed. "It's not the pictures that bothers me; it's, its." Konatsu stared at his clasped hands sitting on his lap. "He said some horrible things."</p><p>"He?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"They young man Konatsu went out on a date with." Nodoka supplied for the silent Konatsu. "A proper young lady never kisses on the first date." She scolded Konatsu. "If I had known, I would never have permitted you going on the date in the first place."</p><p>"Mom." Ranma exclaimed. "I can't believe you gave permission period." She shook her head. "You kissed him huh?" She said to Konatsu. "Is that all you did?"</p><p>"Ranma." Nodoka said disapprovingly. "That was uncalled for."</p><p>Ranma ignored her mother. "Konatsu?" She asked in an inquiring tone. "Was that all you did?" Ranma's mouth lifted wryly when Konatsu shook his head. Ranma sighed. "Figured as much." She walked over and kneeled in front of Konatsu. "I'm not judging you for that." She informed the Kunoichi. "But you can't lie about what you are."</p><p>"But if he knew he wouldn't have, I wouldn't have," Konatsu began only to fall silent under Ranma's hard look. "It's not fair." He said petulantly.</p><p>"No it's not." Ranma agreed. "But that's the way it is. Look Konatsu, I don't blame ya for wantin to have some fun, go out, fall in love. Or lust, as the case maybe." Ranma chuckled slightly.</p><p>"Ranma." Nodoka said reprovingly.</p><p>"Look Mom." Ranma said. "Konatsu was raised as a girl, that was bad enough, but he was also raised in a brothel." She snorted. "The Red Hot Tea House." Ranma rolled her eyes. "I still get nightmares." She said under her breath. "How old were you when they first started training you Konatsu? And I'm not talking about being a Ninja."</p><p>"Thirteen." Konatsu admitted in a voice full of shame. "They made me practice on some of the customers."</p><p>"I had no idea." Nodoka said in horror. "What kind of monsters would do such a thing to a child?"</p><p>"The greedy, self serving kind." Ranma replied shortly. "The kind who think children are property." Ranma's chest started heaving in agitation. Akane put a hand on Ranma's shoulder and squeezed it comfortingly. "Thanks Tomboy." Ranma said quietly. "Sorry Mom, but this stuff always gets me angry."</p><p>Despite her own agitation, and some shame, from Ranma's words, Nodoka was astonished at how quickly Ranma calmed from Akane's simple touch. Nodoka quickly glanced at Ukyo. Ukyo was giving Akane an approving look. Nodoka swallowed to moisten her dry throat. "And rightly so." She managed to say.</p><p>"Thanks Mom." Ranma said. "The point is; Konatsu's self image is female but he is physically male. There's a term for guys who like guys Konatsu; gay." She said. "And being gay is not very well accepted. You're going to have to find people who will accept you."</p><p>Konatsu looked at Ranma helplessly. "Where am I going to find people who will accept me?" He asked plaintively.</p><p>"The Black Orchid." Akane said suddenly.</p><p>Ranma smacked her forehead. "Duh." She exclaimed in self disgust. "You got the address Tomboy?"</p><p>"What's the Black Orchid?" Asked Konatsu.</p><p>"It's a bar and nightclub." Ranma said with a grin. "You'll love it."</p><p>"Why don't we go tonight Ranma?" Akane asked. "We can bring Big Daddy out of the closet." She looked at Ukyo. "How about it Ukyo?" She grinned. "We could double date."</p><p>Ukyo chuckled. "Sure sugar." Ukyo replied. "So what do you say Konatsu; want to go out dancing?"</p><p>"I don't know Miss Ukyo." Konatsu replied. "What makes this place so special?"</p><p>"It's a transvestite bar Konatsu." Ukyo replied. "A gay, transvestite bar to be exact." She giggled. "You'll fit right in." Ukyo giggled at Konatsu's blush. "In fact, the only real problem you're going to have is deciding who you want to go out with." She tapped her lower lip thoughtfully. "Tell you what, after we get back from shopping, well take Auntie home and then you can come back here with us."</p><p>"Why can't I go?" Nodoka asked in annoyance. "I do have some responsibility toward Konatsu; maybe I didn't handle it well before, but I do have some responsibility."</p><p>Ranma was about to disagree when Ukyo leaned across Akane and tapped Ranma on the arm. "Uk-chan?"</p><p>"Let her come with us Ran-chan." Ukyo said with a grin. "I think Konatsu is going to need a chaperone for a little while anyway."</p><p>Ranma nodded. "You're probably right Uk-chan." She looked at her mother. "Okay Mom, you want to go, you can go." Ranma stood. "Now let's go shopping."</p><p>Shopping with the 'girls', as Nodoka came to think of it, was strange in it lack of strangeness. If one didn't know that two of them were actually men it would have been unremarkable in the extreme. There was a lot of giggling as they searched the racks for bargains. Nodoka especially enjoyed the impromptu fashion show that Ranma and Konatsu put on at one point. "My, that was fun." Nodoka commented. She and Ukyo were sitting on a couple chairs while Ranma, Konatsu and Akane were still looking through a couple sales racks.</p><p>"Ah, Ran-chan always was an exhibitionist." Ukyo said with a smile. She leaned over to Nodoka. "I was happy to see Akane smile a little for once." She confided in a whisper. "A real smile not that pasted on one she uses." She looked at Nodoka as if weighing the older woman. "We worry about her."</p><p>"So I see." Nodoka replied seriously. "Is that why the three of you are together? Because you worry about her?"</p><p>"In part." Ukyo admitted. She smiled sourly. "And in part the same old bullshit that the three of us have lived through since we met."</p><p>"Language Ukyo." Nodoka scolded.</p><p>Ukyo began to laugh. "Oh Auntie, Auntie, Auntie." Ukyo said between gasps. "With everything that goes on, you worry about language." Ukyo wiped her eyes.</p><p>Akane, Ranma and Konatsu wandered over. "What's so funny Uk-chan?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Your Mother, Ran-chan." Ukyo replied. She waved a hand. "Never mind." She said. "You find what you wanted?"</p><p>"Oh you know half the fun of shopping is trying on the clothes." Akane replied cheerfully. She held up a bag. "But I did find a few things."</p><p>"Anything I can borrow?" Ukyo asked impishly.</p><p>"I don't know why you bother to ask." Akane mock grumped. "You borrow them anyway."</p><p>"That's because everything of Ranma's is too small in the hips and too large in the chest." Ukyo replied. "You're closer to my size."</p><p>"I'll remind you that you said that." Akane giggled. She sighed happily. "I feel good today."</p><p>Ranma looked into Akane's eyes and smiled. "See? You don't need help to have fun." Ranma briefly hugged Akane. "I'm so proud of you Tomboy."</p><p>"What is Ranma talking about?" Nodoka whispered to Ukyo. "What kind of help?"</p><p>"I wish you hadn't heard that." Ukyo muttered. Ukyo closed her eyes as she thought back to that particularly bad point. It was a couple months after Ranma beat Hikaru. Ukyo had noticed it first. How Akane seemed more cheerful and energetic than usual. How she'd disappear into the bathroom frequently and come out sniffing and wiping her nose. When Ranma finally caught on, about a month later, he hit the roof, then proceeded to follow Akane around all the time and had her sleep in his room every night until he was convinced she had given up the habit. Which, Ukyo reminded herself, wasn't that long ago. "It's nothing Auntie." Ukyo said finally. She opened her eyes. "Old news and nothing you need to concern yourself over." She said. "Let it go Auntie." Ukyo said warningly. She looked over to where Akane was chatting cheerfully with Konatsu and Ranma. 'Another thing you have to account for Ukyo Kuonji.' She thought.</p><p>Ukyo stood. "Anybody, besides me, hungry?" She asked to no one in particular. "I'm in the mood for eel."</p><p>"Great thinking Uk-chan." Ranma patted her flat stomach. "Let's go."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The Kunoichi Konatsu Kanzen looked over his shoulder and at the mirror. "How do I look Miss Ukyo?" He asked.<p>Ukyo whistled in grudging admiration. Konatsu wore a short black dress and sheer nylons. "I think I'm jealous." Ukyo said. "Damn sugar, no one is going to believe you're a guy." She shook her head. "You have your ID?"</p><p>Konatsu picked up a matching small purse. "Right here Miss Ukyo." Konatsu said cheerfully. She looked at Ukyo bashfully. "Are we really going someplace that no one will mind I'm a boy?"</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "Trust me sugar, if someone asks you to dance it's because they know you are a guy. Or at least hoping." She stood up. Ukyo was wearing her favorite white Big Daddy suit. She twirled her cane. "Just like they know I'm a girl."</p><p>"They know?" Konatsu said in astonishment. "I mean, they really know?"</p><p>Ukyo grinned. "Don't let Ranma fool you, he knows damn well where the Black Orchid is and what it is. Honey, I like dressing like a guy." She said the last emphatically. "Ranma can dance with me in either form there and no one bats an eye." She barked a short laugh. "Except maybe in jealousy." Ukyo held out her arm. "Shall we go?"</p><p>Konatsu giggled and took Ukyo's arm. They walked into the main room. She suppressed a smile as she saw Nodoka. "You look very nice auntie." She said.</p><p>Nodoka was wearing a black evening gown more appropriate for a formal dinner but she looked so cute that no one had the heart to tell her. "Are you sure?" Nodoka said nervously. "I really didn't know what to wear."</p><p>"Auntie you look fine." Ukyo assured her.</p><p>"I've been telling her that since she got here." Akane said from Ranma's bedroom door. She was wearing a short frilly white skirt and a matching midriff baring white top. "Relax Auntie." She turned. Akane squealed. "Konatsu you look fantastic."</p><p>Ranma stuck his head out. He whistled in appreciation. "Not bad Konatsu."</p><p>"Hands off Saotome." Ukyo said with suppressed laughter. "He's my date."</p><p>"Only until we get in the club." Akane predicted. "Then all bets are off." She grabbed Ranma's arm. "We gonna have to watch you too?" She asked Ranma.</p><p>Ranma shrugged. "Maybe." He said cheerfully. He tilted his head at Akane. "Think I would?" He asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Akane grumbled. She took a breath. "Whatever you want Ranma." She said quietly. She sighed happily as Ranma wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>"Gotta admit the thought crossed my mind." Ranma admitted in a low voice.</p><p>Akane chuckled. "Pervert." She hugged Ranma. "Let's make Konatsu's coming out party a good one, okay?"</p><p>Ranma laughed then rested his chin on the top of Akane's head. "Okay Tomboy." He said. He held Akane for a long time before releasing her. "Let's go Tomboy." He said. "I got Mom."</p><p>"What do you mean got me?" Nodoka asked. She shrieked as Ranma scooped her up in his arms. "Ranma?" She squeaked. "What is the meaning of this?"</p><p>Ranma grinned. "How did you think we were going to get to the club?" he asked cheerfully. "Taxi's cost money." He carried his worried looking mother to the roof. "Ready?" He asked. Nodoka nodded slowly then shrieked again as Ranma leaped off the roof with her in his arms. Akane, Ukyo then Konatsu bounded after them. Ranma laughed as Nodoka buried her face in Ranma's chest as they bounced across the rooftops.</p><p>Nodoka finally lifted her head and looked around. She immediately buried her face again when she realized how high Ranma could jump even carrying her. She peeked out again. "Oh my."</p><p>"Having fun Mom?" Ranma said. His legs absorbed his landing and he immediately sent the force back down to launch himself back into the air.</p><p>"My, this is exciting." Nodoka said breathlessly. "Genma spoke often of roof hopping but he never described it like this."</p><p>"We do it a little different from Pops." Ranma said. "More like the way Happi does it or the old ghoul." He grinned. "Fasten your seatbelts we are coming in for a landing." The next bounce took Ranma to the edge of a building. He flipped off the ledge and somersaulted to the ground. There were three soft sounds as Akane, Ukyo and Konatsu landed. Akane immediately took out her compact and checked her makeup. She was quickly followed by Konatsu, Ukyo and after he placed Nodoka on her feet, Ranma. "Straighten your dress Mom." Ranma said.</p><p>Nodoka hastily straightened her dress. "Yes, I suppose I should check my makeup as well." She said after a moment. "How is my hair?"</p><p>"You look fine Mom." Ranma said easily. He took his mother's hand. "Now stick with us until we get a place to sit." With Ranma in the lead the group made their way to the door. Even though there was a line, Ranma's party was let in immediately. Nodoka heard whispers.</p><p>"Ranma?" Nodoka asked. "Who are the Terrible Three?"</p><p>Ranma rubbed the back of his head in embarrassment. "Um, that would be us." He waved a hand at Akane and Ukyo. "We're not exactly unknown you know."</p><p>"Oh my, my son is famous." Nodoka bubbled.</p><p>"More like infamous." Akane said cheerfully. "Or is it notorious?" Akane preened slightly. "No." She said decisively. "Respected."</p><p>"I'll go along with that one sugar." Ukyo said. She looked at Konatsu who was hanging on to her arm. "Now you just relax Konatsu and let Big Daddy show you off."</p><p>"Don't you mean around?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Nope." Ukyo replied cheerfully. "You guys find a table. Konatsu and I will get us something to drink." She looked at Nodoka. "I really wouldn't drink the sake here." She told the older woman. "But the wine isn't bad."</p><p>"Wine will be fine dear." Nodoka said in a slightly bemused voice.</p><p>"Come on mom." Ranma said. "I think I see a table." He led his mother to a table. They sat. Nodoka looked around curiously. "It's early mom." Ranma said. "The real show doesn't really get going for another hour or so."</p><p>"Show?" Nodoka asked. "You mean like a cabaret?" She clapped her hands gleefully. "I love stage shows."</p><p>Ranma grinned. "Keep that thought Mom." Ranma replied. Ranma looked up at a sudden burst of noise from the bar. "Hmm sounds like Konatsu has been noticed." He said to Akane.</p><p>"Sounds like." Akane agreed. "Ah here they come." She grinned as Ukyo and Konatsu approached. Trailing behind were a half dozen men. Well she thought they were men, it would be hard to be certain at the Black Orchid. Even before they reached the table, Konatsu was whisked off to the dance floor. "Well we won't be seeing him for awhile." Akane said in amusement.</p><p>"Don't worry sugar, Auntie and I will keep an eye on him." Ukyo said easily. She sat down and sipped her drink. She turned to Nodoka. "Having fun Auntie?"</p><p>"It's not what I expected." Nodoka said slowly. She leaned forward. "They do know Konatsu is a man, don't they?" She waved her hand to indicate the group of men waiting at the edge of the dance floor.</p><p>Ukyo grinned. "Yup." She said cheerfully. "Though Konatsu did have to show his ID." Ukyo looked toward the dance floor. "Though not all the men there are men." Ukyo grinned. "Some are better at it than I am."</p><p>Nodoka looked puzzled. "That doesn't make sense." She said. "Wouldn't they want to dance with a woman?"</p><p>"Ah." Ranma said in understanding. "You're making the wrong assumption. While the Black Orchid is a gay, transvestite club, not all transvestites are gay. In fact, most aren't."</p><p>"I'm not." Ukyo said. "Not really." She smiled. "Tsubasa isn't."</p><p>"True." Agreed Ranma. "But Konatsu certainly is." He grinned. "But for the most part while transvestites want to 'dress up' as men or women, their preferences remain the same." Ranma's grin got wider when an older man walked over to the table. "Regardless, Konatsu's preferences are pretty obvious."</p><p>"Excuse me." The man said. He was possibly in his fifties, fit and had dark hair that had grayed fully at the temples. He looked at Nodoka. "Would you care to dance?" He asked in a pleasant tenor.</p><p>"Well I don't know." Nodoka began.</p><p>"Oh go ahead Mom." Ranma said cheerfully. "Have fun." He looked at the older man. "He looks respectable."</p><p>"Well in that case." Nodoka said. "I'd love to." She got up and was escorted to the dance floor. Fortunately the music was currently more sedate.</p><p>"Think we should tell her?" Akane asked Ranma.</p><p>"Nah." Ranma replied. He chuckled. "Let's see if she figures it out on her own."</p><p>"That's mean Ran-chan." Ukyo said in laughing protest. She waved her hands at Ranma and Akane. "Why don't you two dance for a bit? I'll watch our stuff. Two dances then it's my turn."</p><p>"I'm not going to argue." Akane said. She grabbed Ranma's hand. "Come on Ranma." Akane dragged Ranma off to the dance floor. Akane sighed happily as she and Ranma slow danced together. 'Note to self; be really, really nice to Ukyo.'' Akane looked over to where Ukyo was sitting. Ukyo gave Akane a thumbs up. She smiled slightly and pressed herself even closer to Ranma. The two dances ended all too soon for Akane but she cheerfully handed Ranma off to Ukyo for the next two dances. Akane rested her chin on her hand and watched them dance. Nodoka sat down next to her fanning herself.</p><p>"My, that was exciting." Nodoka said breathlessly. "Fumie is an excellent dancer." She looked at Akane with a touch of annoyance. "You knew didn't you?" She rolled her eyes at Akane's cheerful nod. She followed Akane's gaze where Ranma and Ukyo were dancing together. "I know it's wrong of me but I'm still not comfortable seeing Ranma and Ukyo together like that."</p><p>"It's not that easy for me, but that wasn't what you meant, was it?" Akane sighed. "He's a good man Auntie, better than either Ukyo or I deserve." She sighed again. "It makes him happy Auntie, that's all that counts." She perked up as Ukyo and Ranma returned to the table. "My turn." She said.</p><p>"Hey I need a rest Tomboy." Ranma protested.</p><p>"I wasn't talking to you Ranma." Akane replied. "I meant Ukyo."</p><p>"Well in that case, be my guest." Ranma replied with a laugh. He watched Akane and Ukyo walk off to the dance floor.</p><p>"Ranma?" Nodoka said quietly. "I know this is none of my business, but how long are you planning to keep this charade up?"</p><p>"Which charade is that Mom?" Ranma asked in an even tone.</p><p>"Let them go Ranma." Nodoka pleaded. "It's killing both of them."</p><p>"Better than actually being dead Mom." Ranma replied in all seriousness. "And I'm not holding them; they stay because they want to."</p><p>"Then let them go for your sake." Nodoka replied forcefully. "If you're not going to choose either of them then," She stopped at Ranma's glare. "I just want you to be happy my son."</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath and held it for a moment then let it out slowly. "I know Mom." He replied. "Maybe one day we won't need each other anymore and move on." Ranma smiled slightly. "But not today."</p><p>Akane and Ukyo came running over. "Hey Ran-chan. Auntie. Have you seen Konatsu?" Ukyo asked. "He's not on the dance floor."</p><p>"I'll look around." Ranma stood and walked away.</p><p>Ukyo and Akane sat down. "How are you holding up Auntie?" Ukyo asked.</p><p>"I'm doing fine Ukyo." Nodoka said. She dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief. "You wanted Ranma to leave didn't you?"</p><p>"Well Konatsu is missing but it's not like he's helpless." Akane replied. "Yeah, we wanted him to leave." She stirred the watery remains of her drink with a finger. "You were getting him upset." She said. Akane smiled lopsidedly down at her drink. "It's not hard to figure out what you were talking about."</p><p>Ukyo rested her elbows on the table and her chin on her cupped palms. "Yeah, very few things get Ranma that upset. We're not going anywhere Auntie. Not right now. Right Akane?" Akane nodded.</p><p>"But he's unhappy." Nodoka protested. "Can't you see that?"</p><p>"Ranma's unhappy because we're not happy." Akane corrected the older woman. "And we're unhappy, because we made Ranma unhappy." Her smile twisted. "So we spend a lot of time trying to make each other happy." Akane uncrossed her legs and leaned closer to Nodoka. "Sometimes we even succeed."</p><p>Ranma approached dragging a protesting Konatsu behind him. "But Ranma." Whimpered Konatsu. "I was having fun." He kept looking longingly to the back of the bar.</p><p>"You were having half the regulars in the place." Ranma said mildly. He pushed Konatsu into a seat. "Bathroom." He informed Akane, Ukyo and his mother. "Like a little kid in a candy store." He raised his hands. "Hold the jokes." Akane and Ukyo giggled. "Honestly Konatsu and people call me a slut."</p><p>"Konatsu!" Nodoka said in disapproval. "If you were my daughter I'd ground you for a month." She gave Konatsu a glare. "And fix your makeup. Your lipstick is all smudged."</p><p>"I'd love to see you try grounding Konatsu." Ukyo rolled her eyes. "Only half the regulars?"</p><p>"There was a line. The bathroom isn't that big." Ranma replied. "As it was, I had trouble getting me in there and then getting the two of us out." He looked at Konatsu. "Stop sighing like that." He ordered.</p><p>"But they let me." Whimpered Konatsu. "They knew I'm a guy and they let me." Konatsu sighed. "There was this one guy." Konatsu spread his hands apart. "This big." He said in awe.</p><p>"Konatsu!" Exclaimed a scandalized Nodoka. "That's enough." She glared at the giggling Ranma, Akane and Ukyo. "This is not funny." She scolded. "And certainly not proper." She turned her attention back to Konatsu. "If you are going to look like a young lady then you need to learn how to act like a young lady."</p><p>"But Auntie." Wailed Konatsu.</p><p>"Enough." Nodoka said firmly. "We're going home."</p><p>"Want a ride home Mom?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Nodoka shuddered slightly. "No thank you." She said. "I think I'd prefer to take a taxi." She took Konatsu's hand. "Come along Konatsu." Nodoka sailed out of the restaurant towing a reluctant Kunoichi behind her.</p><p>"Bye everybody." Konatsu called from the door. "Thank you. I had a wonderful time." He waved as Nodoka pulled him out of the bar.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo stared at the door for a moment and then at each other. They broke up into helpless laughter. Ranma wiped his eyes. "Oh gods, that was fun." He stood. "We'd better go before everyone starts pestering us for his phone number."</p><p>"Ranma?" Akane asked.</p><p>"Yeah Tomboy?"</p><p>"You wanna sleep in our room tonight?" Akane gave Ranma a hungry look. "Please." She begged.</p><p>"Please." Chorused Ukyo.</p><p>Ranma laughed. "Yeah, like I'm gonna say no." Ranma walked over and placed an arm around the girls' waists. "You've been doing real good. Nice teamwork by the way, thanks for rescuing me from my mom."</p><p>"We'd be pretty bad teammates if we didn't." Akane said seriously. "Party time is gonna end soon."</p><p>"Glad you realize that." Ranma started walking toward the exit, taking the girls with him. He chuckled. "Konatsu is a trip."</p><p>"Trying to make up for lost time, I guess." Ukyo said knowingly. "I'll call Ono in the morning and have him talk to Konatsu about using condoms and stuff."</p><p>"Good thinking Uk-chan." Ranma replied. They exited the building. Ranma looked at the night sky. "I feel like walkin for a bit." He said after a moment.</p><p>"Whatever you want Ranma." Akane said. "But a walk sounds nice to me too."</p><p>"Same here." Ukyo said. She and Akane rested their heads on Ranma's shoulders."It's a beautiful night."</p><p>"Yeah." Agreed Akane.</p><p>End Chapter 3</p><p>Author's Notes; I'm surprised the gaff squad wasn't up in arms. The character's name is Hikaru Nakamura not Hitoshi.</p>
