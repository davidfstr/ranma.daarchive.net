</div><p>Chapter 2</p><p>'I want a real man'</p><p>"Welcome to Japan Tonight, I'm Satchi Kato." The pretty reporter smiled at the camera as a picture of a number of women in black catsuits was displayed in the screen behind her. The women's faces were all concealed, by what appeared to be feathered masks that gave each of the women a birdlike appearance. "The Fallen Angels strike again." She announced. "This picture was taken by a motorist with his cell phone." She said.</p><p>"A police report of the time and place shows that an alledged pimp was found trussed up with ropes and hanging under a water tower." The image changed to show a man dangling upside down while a firetruck was extending a ladder to reach him. "According to the police report, the man had been beaten badly and required hospitalization." Satchi Koto smiled coldly. "At about the same time and very close to where the alleged pimp was found an ambulance was called to pick up a thirty year old woman for a broken nose and jaw." The picture behind the reporter showed a woman with her face being patched up. It hurt to even look at her yet the woman was smiling victoriously. The image switched back to the reporter. "Tonights topic, The Fallen Angels, heros or vigilantes?" She said. "When we come back."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Next on the agenda." Kimi Ota said. "Our expansion into Hokkaido." She pushed her glasses back. "Mr. Wasuhara?"</p><p>Tokio Wasuhara leaned back in his chair. "Oyabun Honda has an excellent organization." The Yakuza lord began. "Maybe a little too excellent."</p><p>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "Explain." She demanded. "Are you having problems with Oyabun Honda?"</p><p>Tokio laughed. "You misunderstand, Ice Queen." He said. "They've been looking for an entryway to Tokyo for years," There was a box on the table in front of Tokio and he opened it. He extracted a cigar. He looked at Nabiki. "You mind?" He asked. Nabiki shook her head. Tokio nodded and lit the cigar. "Kinnikun has a packing crate full of these cigars. Just waiting for us to bring it into Tokyo." He puffed the cigar. "Not to mention; chocolates, liquors, and what have you."</p><p>"I don't see the problem." Kyoshi Nerumi commented.</p><p>"The problem, Kyoshi." Tokio said. "Is that Oyabun Honda has more contraband than anyone anticipated." He waved the cigar. "Our current distribution system is inadequate."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. 'I must remember to not underestimate Tokio.' She told herself. 'He may act like a pig, but there's a first class brain behind that coarse exterior.' Nabiki pursed her lips. "I agree." She said. "Suggestions?" Nabiki noticed Noriko whisper into Kodachi's ear and then point something out on her laptop. "Ms. Kuno?"</p><p>"Noriko may have found us a solution." Kodachi said slowly. "Nothing definite as yet, but it looks promising." She cut her eyes over to Tokio. From behind her veil she could see the Yakusa Lord's eyes narrow.</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Well let us know. In the meantime, anyone else?" There was a general murmur of negatives. "In that case, Kimi is there anything else?" Kimi shook her head. "Then, I declare this meeting adjourned." Nabiki rose. "Thank you gentlemen, ladies." She said. Right behind Nabiki, Tatewaki rose as well.</p><p>"Oh Brother." Kodachi called. "You do remember we are having dinner this weekend?" Kodachi said to Tatewaki. "Cook will be very put out if you cancel yet again."</p><p>Tatewaki chuckled. "We can't have that." He rumbled. "Don't worry Sister, we will be there."</p><p>Kodachi looked at Kimi. "I'm expecting you to make sure he keeps his word, Lady Ota." She said sternly.</p><p>Kimi laughed. "By which you mean, both of them. Don't worry, Kodachi, we'll be there." She said. She waved her hand in goodbye as she followed Nabiki and Tatewaki out the door.</p><p>Kodachi and Noriko walked silently out of the room, picking up Abe as they left. This was not the first time Kodachi used Abe as a bodyguard. Not that she needed it but there were appearances to maintain and the huge Abe was an intimidating presence . Abe followed Kodachi and Noriko into the garage and to their waiting limo. The limo driver, a Kuno retainer, came to attention as they approached. Abe opened the passenger door for Kodachi and Kimi and waited until they settled themselves before closing the door. Abe climbed into the front passenger seat. Abe turned to look into the back seat. "Home, Ms. Kuno?" He asked.</p><p>"Yes, Abe." Kodachi replied. "And thank you."</p><p>"No problem, Ms. Kuno." Abe rumbled. He turned back around and nodded to the driver. A smoked glass partition rose blocking off the front compartment's view.</p><p>Kodachi sighed and removed her veil. "Wasuhara grows bold." She said without preamble. "That was a deliberate attack on Nabiki." She said.</p><p>"Trying to make it seem as if Nabiki is slipping?" Noriko thought about it for a moment. "You may be right." She said. "On the other hand, he showed his own incompetance by not having a solution at the ready." Noriko pointed out.</p><p>"Indeed." Kodachi said with a grim smile. "But he doesn't need to be perfect, does he?" She said. "Nabiki may be successful but old habits die hard." Kodachi leaned back against the seat and closed her eyes. "Let's just hope we are successful in convincing him."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Makoto walked into the club dressed in an short evening dress in her favorite shade of blue. She waved hello to Abe at his station in front of the door to the club in the back. Abe smiled and opened the door for Makoto. "Good to see you, Makoto." Abe said in greeting.</p><p>"You too, Abe." Makoto replied. "Rei here yet?" She asked. To Makoto's surprise the big, burly bouncer seemed to blush.</p><p>Abe nodded. "Miss Ayami arrived about a half hour ago."</p><p>Makoto raised an eyebrow. 'Miss Ayami?' She thought. 'Interesting'. Makoto entered the club. It was early evening, not yet eight, but the club was already busy. She walked to the back of the club and got into a private elevator that took her to the third floor. She tossed her bag onto a couch and then walked back into the elevator to take her back to the main floor.</p><p>Makoto went to the changing room. By some unspoken agreement, all of Kodachi's special girls changed in the same room as the other working girls. In Makoto's case, changing consisted on putting on a small apron. She waved hello to the girls there and chatted with one or two before going out into the main part of the club.</p><p>Makoto was a very popular girl at Ky's Cafe. The fact that she was unavailable except to a very select few didn't stop many regulars from flirting with her. When she first started working at the club the occassional comment would make her blush. Now, more confident, she learned to give as good as she got. Sometimes she'd sit with one or two of the more important high rollers and talk. Somehow and without being raunchy or crude, as if Auntie would let her, Makoto could arouse any patron. Aoi would half joke that any time one of the regular working girls needed to make some money all they'd have to do was follow in Makoto's wake.</p><p>Tonight would probably be no different but first she had to say hello to Rei. The raven haired Rei was, as was usual for her, when she wasn't singing, sitting in at a small private booth near the back. Auntie's booth. Rei usually sat there when, as now, Auntie Nodoka was not in the club. Again this was a special priviledge of Kodachi's girl's but Rei was the only one who sat there regularly. Rei was sipping from a tea cup with a slightly pensive look on her face.</p><p>"Hey girlfriend." Makoto called as she approached. "Scoot over." She eased into the booth next to Rei. "How's it going?"</p><p>Rei waggled a hand. "So, So." She replied. "I can't believe I'm going to say this but; I'm bored." Rei sipped her tea. "Not bored with the club, bored with the men." She blew out a breath. "I want a real man." Rei looked momentarily toward the door to the outer club.</p><p>Makoto snorted. "So do something about it." She said firmly. "I mean, you have to know Abe likes you."</p><p>Rei spit out her tea. "Abe?" She coughed. "I didn't say it was Abe." She stammered to a halt. "What do you mean he likes me?"</p><p>Makoto slapped a disbelieving hand over her face. "You have got to be kidding." She said. "The man only half worships you."</p><p>"How can you say that?" Rei shot back. "He never talks to me. Did you know he's started calling me 'Miss Ayami'?" She said plaintively.</p><p>Makoto shook her head. "Man, and Miki says I'm slow." She said. "He's obviously afraid of being rejected by you."</p><p>"Why would he be afraid of being rejected by me?" Rei asked slowly. "I'm nice."</p><p>Makoto shook her head again. "Rei. Rei. Rei." She intoned sadly. "What will we do with you?" She said in passable imitation of Nodoka. "I hate to tell you this, but you're the only one who thinks he's cute." She shuddered slightly. "The man is huge."</p><p>"I like big men." Rei said defensively.</p><p>"I dare you." Makoto said suddenly. "I dare you to go out to Abe and talk to him."</p><p>"Talk to him?" Rei asked slowly.</p><p>"Yeah." Makoto said firmly. "Talk to him." Her hand reached out and tapped Rei's spider pendant. "Besides, the honor of Kodachi's girls is at stake."</p><p>Rei's hand closed around the pendant. Her face suddenly firmed. "You're right." She said decisively. "I'm one of Kodachi's Girls and we're not afraid of any man." She stood. Makoto made room for Rei to leave. "If I want to talk to Abe, I will talk to Abe."</p><p>"You got it girl." Makoto said in approval. "Now go get your man."</p><p>"Right." Rei exclaimed.</p><p>Makoto watched Rei march away. "Thank the gods." She said under her breath. She shook her head. "Abe." She said in amusement. "Who'd of thought it?" She rolled her eyes. "Well it takes all kinds."</p><p>Rei strode toward the door that led out of the club. She slowed as she reached the door. Her hand reached for the doorknob, Rei hesitated. Her other hand rubbed her pendant. Rei took a breath. "Here goes." She said under her breath. She opened the door.</p><p>Abe blinked as the door opened and Rei walked out. He scrambled to his feet and bowed. "Miss Ayami." He said respectfully. Abe straightened and shifted uneasily on his feet. "Is there something I can do for you, Miss Ayami."</p><p>"Rei." Rei said sharply. "My name is Rei, it's my name, use it." She said firmly.</p><p>Abe blanched. "I couldn't do that, Miss Ayami." He mumbled.</p><p>"Why the hell...heck not." Rei said. "Sorry Auntie." She muttered. She put her hands on her hip. "Don't you like me?" She raised a finger and shook it under Abe's nose. "What's wrong with me?" She demanded. "I know you've been with Aoi at least once and one or two of the other girls." She said. "What's wrong with me?" She repeated. "Abe," She stopped. "What is your name anyway?"</p><p>"Botan." Abe said meekly.</p><p>"Botan Abe ." She said sternly. "You are the most frustrating man I've ever met."</p><p>"Ah c'mon, Rei." Abe said. "Why'd I think as fine and as beautiful a woman like you would want to be with a big, stupid, fat man, like me?" He said plaintively. "Even if I could afford you?"</p><p>"Me." Rei said firmly. She pushed the big man back with her finger. Abe bounced back like he had been hit with a sledgehammer and fell onto his stool. To Abe's surprise, Rei immediately crawled into his lap. "I like big men and what I charge is my business. Okay?" She said. "And you're not stupid, Ms. Kuno doesn't keep stupid people around her." She poked the big man in the chest. "Got it?"</p><p>"Yes Rei." Abe said. He wrapped her in his arms.</p><p>Rei purred in contentment. "I just knew you'd know how to hug." Rei said happily. She pressed herself against Abe's bulk.</p><p>"You gotta date tonight?" Abe asked.</p><p>"Depends." Rei replied. "You asking for a date?"</p><p>"Yeah." Abe rumbled huskily.</p><p>"Then yes, I have a date tonight." She looked up at Abe. "I get off at two."</p><p>Abe looked down at the woman in his arms. "I know."</p><p>Kodachi , Noriko and a trailing Yuki entered the restaurant fronting Ky's club and headed toward the back. Kodachi and Noriko stopped suddenly. "Is that Rei?" Kodachi whispered to Noriko. Noriko nodded numbly. The two women stared at the scene in front of them. Rei Ayami the star attraction at Ky's Cafe in the embrace of Botan Abe, the bouncer. Kodachi raised a finger, lowered it, raised it again. Kodachi sighed. "Good evening , Ms. Ayami, Abe."</p><p>Abe's eyes widened in shock. "Ms. Kuno, I, we, I mean." He stopped when Rei elbowed him.</p><p>"Good evening Ms. Kuno." Rei said cheerfully.</p><p>"I hope you remember you have to perform in," Kodachi looked at her watch. "Exactly 45 minutes." She folded her arms across her chest. "And I don't want Abe not paying attention to his responsibilities."</p><p>"Don't worry, Ms. Kuno, he won't." Rei said for the two of them. She sighed. "I should get ready." She said. Rei climbed off Abe's lap. "Two a.m. sharp, remember?" Rei said to Abe, Abe nodded. "Good." She waited until Abe opened the door then followed Kodachi, Noriko and Yuki into the main club. Rei veered off to her dressing room while Kodachi, Noriko and Yuki made a beeline for the rear office.</p><p>"What do we have scheduled tonight?" Kodachi asked as they entered the office. Kodachi sat at her desk. She removed her veil and placed it carefully on the desk.</p><p>"The usual." Noriko flipped quickly through an appointment book. "A couple of the boys have a delivery to make but that's all." She tossed the book on the desk. "Makoto?"</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "Makoto." She said in agreement. "Yuki, could you please find Makoto and ask her to come see me?" Yuki nodded. "Oh and Yuki?" Kodachi said. "I must commend you on your choice of clothing." She said. "That golden orange is definitely your color."</p><p>"You're looking hot, Yuki." Noriko said in approval.</p><p>"Thank you My Lady. Ms Mata." Yuki blushed slightly. "Miki helped me pick it out." She admitted. She tugged at the hem of her high cut dress. "I still think it's too short." She grumped slightly. She bowed. "If you'll excuse me, My Lady."</p><p>Yuki turned and exited the office. Despite her earlier complaint, Yuki liked the attention she was getting. 'And why not?' She asked herself. 'I deserve it.' She then answered herself. Yuki found her time with the 'girls' had changed her. Always confident, her confidence had changed. Before she had been confident that she could take any man now she was confident she could have any man. Not that she had but that wasn't important. Yuki looked around and spotted Makoto at a table talking to some men. Yuki smiled ruefully. 'She makes it look so easy.' She thought in envy. 'And she doesn't even know she does it.' Rei walked over. "Sorry to interrupt gentlemen, but I'm going to have to take Makoto away." She smiled at the suppressed groans from the men.</p><p>"Oh poo." Makoto grumped with a smile. "Sorry boys." She stood. The men at the table hastily climbed to their feet and bowed. Makoto walked away. "What's up?" She asked Yuki.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno wants to see you." Yuki replied. She looked over to Makoto. "I don't know what it is but it has to do with your Genji." She said cheerfully. "Something good."</p><p>"Really?" Makoto squealed excitedly.</p><p>"What do you see in that man?" Yuki asked in curiosity. "I mean, he's not bad looking for a man his age but," Yuki stopped when Makoto started to giggle. She raised an eyebrow. "Come on girl, give?" Yuki begged. Makoto giggled and shook her head. "That good, huh?" Yuki asked. Makoto nodded. Yuki sighed. "I'm going to get it out of you one day, you know that?" She warned. Makoto smiled.</p><p>They reached the door to the office. Yuki knocked. "It's Yuki." She said through the door. "I have Makoto with me." She opened the door and Yuki waved Makoto in. Makoto nodded to Yuki and entered the office. Yuki followed behind and closed the door.</p><p>Kodachi and Noriko stood in greeting as Makoto entered. "Good evening, Makoto." Kodachi said. Noriko nodded hello. Kodachi waved Makoto to a couch. "Please sit." She said. Kodachi sat in a seat opposite. "Noriko, why don't you get Makoto some of the '02." She said. Kodachi waited until Makoto was served. "So tell me, Makoto, how are things going with Genji Morimoto?"</p><p>"Oh Genji is very happy." Makoto said. "He only wishes he could see me more often." Makoto sighed. "He really doesn't like sharing me, but he understands."</p><p>"You did say Tenchi and Kojiro were getting restless." Kodachi said musingly. Kodachi leaned forward. "My Brother and his Ladies are coming to the mansion this weekend." Kodachi said. "I was wondering if you and Mr. Morimoto would like to attend?"</p><p>"Really?" Makoto said excitedly.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "I want to be honest with you Makoto, your Genji could do the Ice Queen a great service and I'm counting on your help."</p><p>"You can count on me Ms. Kuno." Makoto promised. "Oh, oh, I have to call Genji." She exclaimed. Makoto looked at Kodachi who nodded. Makoto fished into her clutch purse and took out a cell phone. She quickly punched in a number. Makoto raised the phone to her ear. "Hello Genji baby?" Makoto smiled. "Yes, it's me." She said. "Baby, Ms. Kuno wants to know if you'd like to come to dinner at the mansion this weekend?"</p><p>"He can stay to entire weekend if he'd like." Kodachi added.</p><p>"Did you hear that baby?" Makoto asked. "Yes, a whole weekend together." She giggled. "I should never have told you that." She said teasingly. "Maybe if you're a good boy." Makoto giggled again.</p><p>"Tell him we'll send a car." Kodachi said in amusement. "Saturday afternoon."</p><p>End Chapter 2</p><p>Author's Notes: Shortish chapter but at least you're getting it fast. I'll probably release a chapter a week for awhile. By the way, Botan Abe, should by rights be shown as Abe Botan but I don't want to confuse the issue. Asians tend to put the family name first, given name last but like I said, I didn't want to confuse the issue.</p>
