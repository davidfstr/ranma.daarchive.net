</div><p>Begin chapter 3</p><p>'Prelude to revenge'</p><p>The limo drove up the long driveway of the Kuno mansion. A slim and dark haired beauty waited imperiously at the top of the stairs. She kept her face impassive but inside she was seething. 'Here.' Kodachi thought angrily. "He dares brings his women here. Thank heavens Father is abroad. The shame would kill him.' She watched as the limo stopped at the foot of the stairs. One of Tatewaki's personal retainers jumped out of the passenger side of the front and hurried to open the rear door. That received a grudgingly approving nod from Kodachi.</p><p>The first person to exit was a tall blond. Kodachi's agents had identified her as Kimi Ota. 'Whore.' Kodachi hid a sneer. 'He consorts with an actual whore." She watched Tatewaki exit the limo. Kodachi's expression became stony as the last person exited the limo. 'Nabiki Tendo.' Her agents had given her a short but accurate assessment of the middle Tendo girl. Of all the people she encountered while in High School Nabiki Tendo was the last person she ever expected her brother to associate with. Kimi Ota she could dismiss as a fling but Nabiki Tendo. 'Not the sister you originally intended but a Tendo nonetheless. Nabiki Tendo.' She suppress a growl. If her sources were correct, and she had no reason to doubt, the middle Tendo was now one of the most powerful women in Tokyo. That alone was enough to make Kodachi hate the woman, but what she was, was worse than who she was. 'I knew you were a without scruples but I never thought you'd sink so low. Yakusa.' A hiss escaped from between her lips.</p><p>Kodachi steeled herself to stand at the top of the stairs as the trio approached. Tatewaki had demanded, no commanded, her presence and Kodachi had no choice but the comply. Kodachi eyed her brother as he approached. 'I must admit he is dressing better.' She thought grudgingly. The charcoal-gray silk suit hung flatteringly on her brother's muscular frame. She waited until the three reached the landing before giving a short bow. "Brother." She said emotionlessly.</p><p>"Sister. Good of you to greet us." Tatewaki said in approval. "I believe you know, at least one, of my companions."</p><p>"Tendo." Kodachi gritted.</p><p>"Kuno." Nabiki replied easily. "May I introduce my friend and associate," She indicated Kimi. "Kimi Ota."</p><p>"Ota." Kodachi hissed.</p><p>Kimi raised an eyebrow. "Kuno." Kimi smiled back. "Tatewaki has told me so much about you." She cooed.</p><p>"You have the advantage of me." Kodachi replied. "Tatewaki has said so little of you." She looked haughtily down at Kimi. "One would almost think he's ashamed of his association with you."</p><p>"You mean you don't have a little file on her already Kodachi?" Nabiki asked in falsely pleasant tones. "Your people are slipping."</p><p>"My people are quite competent, thank you." Kodachi returned coldly. She gave Nabiki a knowing smile. "And quite thorough."</p><p>Nabiki's returning smile was as cold as her voice. "As are mine." Nabiki replied.</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Kodachi asked with narrowed eyes.</p><p>Nabiki's smile turned icy. "I wondered why there was no demand for money." Nabiki said. "I can understand me." Nabiki continued. "But why Konatsu?"</p><p>"I-I don't know what you are talking about." Kodachi replied. She drew herself up. "I suppose I can't forbid you to enter. Brother is head of the family while Father is out of town." Kodachi turned and walked back into the house.</p><p>Kimi leaned over to Nabiki. "It was her?" She said in disbelief.</p><p>"I wasn't sure until just now." Nabiki replied in a tight voice. She turned to Tatewaki who was staring after his sister in barely suppressed rage. "Leave her be Tatewaki."</p><p>"How can you expect me to just let that pass?" He growled.</p><p>"Because any revenge is mine to deliver." Nabiki replied in her own growl. "Konatsu, I think, was a diversion but she'll pay for that as well."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"So how did Gos learn the Umisenken?" Ukyo asked.<p>"It wasn't the Umisenken." Ranma replied moodily. "That's what I thought at first but," Ranma grabbed his pigtail and looked at the end. "Hell he's no Chi adept." He grumped. He leaned the kitchen chair back against the wall.</p><p>"What Umisenken?" Ting Li asked curiously from her perch on the kitchen counter. She kicked her legs idly.</p><p>"A technique my Pop developed. I'll show ya later." Ranma replied. "Done right you can become almost invisible; at least when there are shadows or it's dark out." He shook his head. "But ya gotta be a Chi adept." He complained.</p><p>"Maybe he had the ability all along Ranma." Akane said reasonably. "Or maybe Cologne taught him." She added a moment later. "That would explain why he was there."</p><p>"Or he was there because he already knew how." Ukyo countered. She waved a hand. "It doesn't matter how he learned it, or even what he learned, he can do it. That's what counts."</p><p>"Ukyo speak truth." Ting Li said firmly. "Now, what we do about it?" Ting Li leaned forward. "How we find him?"</p><p>Akane tapped her lower lip with her index finger. "He used to have a crush on me when we were in High school." Akane said musingly.</p><p>"What'cha thinking Tomboy?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"I'm thinking we're overdue for a visit home." Akane replied with a slight smile. "I wouldn't mind seeing Daddy and Kasumi." She said. "Maybe give Gos' mom a visit."</p><p>"I think just you and Ranma should go see Mrs. G." Ukyo said. "She really doesn't know me and Ting Li. She might not open up in front of strangers." Ukyo looked down. "Ting Li and I can go check up on Konatsu and Auntie. Maybe I'll take a turn at the grill. It's been awhile. Might need to pick it up again."</p><p>Akane looked pensively at Ukyo. "Sure Uk-chan." Akane looked at Ranma.</p><p>"Sounds like we have a plan." Ranma leaned his chair forward and stretched. "Well it's been a long day. I'm for bed." He stood. Akane stood as well. Ranma looked at Ukyo. "Coming Uk-chan?"</p><p>Ukyo shook her head. "I'm not really sleepy. Why don't the two of you go ahead? I'll bunk in with Ting Li tonight."</p><p>"You sure Uk-chan?" Akane asked. Ukyo nodded. Akane sighed and walked out of the kitchen. Ranma gave Ukyo a concerned look then followed.</p><p>Ting Li waited until she heard the door to the bedroom close before she hopped off the kitchen counter. "Why you not go with them?" She asked. "They want you be with them."</p><p>"I-I'm trying to wean myself off of them." Ukyo replied in a quiet voice.</p><p>Ting Li shook a finger at Ukyo. "Oh no. I tell you before. You not leave until she tell you go." She raised a hand. "No but." She pulled Ukyo to her feet spun her around and pushed her toward the bedroom door. "Now you go to them." She waved the backs of her hands at Ukyo. "Go."</p><p>Ukyo looked at the door for a long moment before she hesitantly knocked on the door. "It's me." She said quietly. "I-I think I'm sleepy after all." The door opened even before Ukyo finished speaking and she was pulled so quickly into the bedroom her feet almost left the ground.</p><p>Ting Li rolled her eyes and fought to keep from laughing. "So, so silly." She muttered cheerfully and went to make herself another cup of tea.</p><p>The bedroom door was barely closed before Ukyo found herself hugged between Akane and Ranma. Akane was in front of her and looked close to tears. "Why Ukyo?" Akane asked. "What did I do wrong?"</p><p>"Wrong?" ukyo said in disbelief. "You didn't do anything wrong. It's just. Aw come on Akane, I mean, it's you and Ranma, I'm just a third wheel."</p><p>"Come on yourself Uk-chan." Akane shot back almost angrily. "What do you think is going to happen? You think me and Ranma are going to get married and settle down with a bunch of kids?" She nodded toward Ranma. "Can you see the jerk as a Daddy?"</p><p>"Hey, I'd be a good dad." Ranma half protested. "Just like Pops."</p><p>Ukyo shivered. "I see your point." She said to Akane. "That's kind of a scary thought." She elbowed Ranma when he complained.</p><p>"And me." Akane continued. "Can you see me as a Mom?"</p><p>"Well not at the moment." Ukyo admitted slowly. "But that's now, what about later?"</p><p>"What about later?" Akane shot back. "Let later take care of later. Right now we're U.S.A., the hottest strippers in Tokyo." She gave Ukyo a grin that seemed more like one of Ranma's cockiest. "And we're the Terrible Three, the baddest girls on the block."</p><p>Ranma snickered.</p><p>"Do you really want to give all that up?' Akane ignored Ranma. She held Ukyo at arms length. "Because that's what you'll have to do. I can't worry that you'll resent me. Maybe hate me."</p><p>"Oh come on Akane." Ukyo protested. "You know I'd never hate you." She looked down. "You're the best friend I ever had." She smiled but didn't look up. "Well other than Ranma." Ukyo sighed. "You sure?" she asked plaintively.</p><p>"We're sure Uk-chan." Ranma replied. "Like the Tomboy said; Let later take care of later. We ain't ready to settle down." Ranma's smile dropped slightly. "And we still got work to do."</p><p>Ting Li turned the page of her magazine."Well she's still in there." She said to the empty room. "I wonder if the Spirt Sisters went through the same thing? I think I'll write home and ask." She turned the page. "Ooh that's pretty." She squealed at the picture. Ting Li leafed idly through the magazine. Her thoughts drifted back to the three people in the other room. "Still in there." She said approvingly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Ohh my." Kimi said in awe as she entered Tatewaki's bedroom. "It's as big as our old apartment." She breathed.<p>"Not quite girlfriend but close." Agreed Nabiki. She noted with approval that their suitcases had been brought into the suite. She walked over to one of the suitecases and opened it. "I feel like being slinky, how about you?"</p><p>Kimi laughed. "I like the way you think." She replied. "Let's rub the bitch's nose in it." She added cheerfully.</p><p>"That was the idea." Nabiki replied. "The Kuno's have always thought themselves so superior." She growled. "It's about time someone took them down a peg." She gave Kimi a wry smile. "Well not Tatewaki." She sighed. "And that's going to be a problem, whatever I do can't hurt Lover boy."</p><p>"So we target Kodachi." Kimi shrugged. "The only real difference between her and us is that no one took pictures of her."</p><p>Nabiki started to chuckle. "Have I ever told you how much I love smart women?" She said. "I wonder if I could get Ranma to seduce her?' She mused.</p><p>"I doubt it." Kimi replied seriously. "And that wouldn't be humiliating enough would it?"</p><p>"Good point." Nabiki conceded. "No, I want her to know what it felt like." Nabiki's voice turned into a growl. "I want her to suffer the way I suffered. I want the bitch to know you never cross the Ice Queen."</p><p>Tatewaki looked up as Nabiki and Kimi walked down the stairs. Despite having had the two women as lovers for some time now the sight of the two women set his heart racing in desire. Both women wore tight black gowns with necklines that plunged so low their navals were nearly visible. The gowns themselves fitted so tightly it seemed unlikely they wore any underwear whatsoever. The two women descended the stairs slowly.</p><p>Tatewaki licked dry lips when the two women finally achieved the landing. "My ladies." He said in a voice husky with emotion. "This home has never seen such beauty."</p><p>Nabiki ran her hand gently across Tatewaki's chin. "You approve." She purred. She smiled at Tatewaki's voiceless nod. "I wasn't sure how you wanted us to dress for dinner. I was afraid you'd make us go back and change." She pouted.</p><p>"I'd be a fool to do that." Tatewaki replied. He smiled. "Mayhaps I am no longer as much a fool as before." He said hopefully. Tatewaki tilted his head. "Now that I come to think of it, I think my sister will be livid." He offered his arm.</p><p>"Good." Nabiki replied. She took Tatewaki's arm. Kimi took possession of Tatewaki's other arm. "Is anyone joining us for dinner?" She asked as the approached the dining room. "Other than your sister, that is?"</p><p>"Unfortunately no." Tatewaki replied. He stopped at the closed door of the dining room. "I hope your revenge will be," Tatewaki paused. "Tasteful." He said finally.</p><p>"You're not going to try to talk me out of it?' Nabiki asked in surprise.</p><p>"Even if I wished to, I doubt I'd be successful." Tatewaki admitted.</p><p>"Don't worry Baby." Nabiki assured the tall kendoist. "Unlike your sister, I will spare the Kuno name."</p><p>Tatewaki bowed his head. "Thank you My lady." He said softly. "Now, shall we go in for dinner?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi seethed silently during dinner. It was bad enough being forced to attend dinner with those women but, Kodachi thought, couldn't they at least have the decency to not look like tramps. Though, if truth be told, Kodachi's thoughts contained more than a touch of jealousy. 'I must find who makes their clothes.' She told herself. To Kodachi's educated eyes the women's clothes were obviously custom made and fitted. 'what am I thinking?' She thought a moment later. 'Why would I wish to emulate those, those." Kodachi's thoughts broke off as she realized Tatewaki spoke to her. "I'm sorry Brother." She said. "What was that you said?"<p>"I had asked if there was something wrong with your dinner?" Tatewaki asked. "You've hardly touched your meal."</p><p>"Oh I'm not really that hungry." Kodachi looked down at her plate. "One must watch one's figure you know." She added. She pushed her plate away. "If you'll excuse me I think I'll retire early."</p><p>"Of course Sister." Tatewaki said genially. "We'll see you in the morning." Tatewaki inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. Whatever Nabiki had in mind did not come during dinner. 'Except possibly to demonstrate how little My Ladies think of her.' Tatewaki looked to his right and left. 'How so much more pleasant it is to have what is offered rather than try to take what is not.' He thought in satisfaction. 'I was indeed a fool.' Tatewaki looked after his departing sister. 'What will it take for you to grow up as I have?' He shook her head. "I think she did it to protect me." He said aloud.</p><p>"That's the only reason I'm not going to hurt her." Nabiki sipped her wine and place the glass on the table. "Much." She snorted. "In a way I owe her." Her face grew cold. "But she hurt Daddy." She said. "And Konatsu." She added after a long pause.</p><p>Tatewaki turned his head and looked at Kimi. "You will keep an eye on Nabiki won't you?" He asked the tall blond. "You know how she can get carried away."</p><p>"Don't worry baby, I think I have an idea what Nabs has in mind." She smiled. "It will be," She looked across Tatewaki to Nabiki. "Fitting." She said finally.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ryoga bounded across the roofs of Nerima. 'At least I'm back in Nerima.' He thought in satisfaction. It had taken a week but he had made it back. Getting lost didn't bother Ryoga as much as it used to. Living off the land was second nature but rarely necessary these days. There was always a town and where there was a town there was work. Whether pulling a plow, loading or unloading trucks or working as a bouncer in a bar there was work. If he was lucky there was street fight. Ryoga didn't remember the last time he lost.<p>Ryoga's stomach grumbled and he looked around for a place to eat. His face lit up when he spied a familiar restaurant. "Hey Uk-chan's" He exclaimed. "I could go for an Okonomiyaki." He dropped to the street in front of the restaurant and walked in. A young woman approached.</p><p>"Welcome to Uk-chan's." The woman began. She stopped. "Ryoga?"</p><p>Ryoga blinked. He smiled. "Hey Natsu." He said cheerfully."How you doing?" He stiffly accepted Konatsu's hug in greeting. "Dream on Natsu." He said in the same cheerful tones.</p><p>"Oh I do." Konatsu laughed. He linked his arm through the arm of the burly martial artist and led him toward the grill. "Auntie." The transvestite called. "Look who's here."</p><p>"Ryoga." Nodoka called in greeting. "It's been too long." She leaned across the grill and accepted a kiss on the cheek from Ryoga. "Ranma has been asking about you."</p><p>Ryoga swallowed a sarcastic retort. This was Ranma's mother after all. 'Probably looking for a date.' He thought. "Oh?" He said. "Did he say what for?"</p><p>"Not exactly." Nodoka replied. "But he did say you might find it fun." Nodoka smiled. "You can ask him yourself. He and the girls just got into town." She fished in to her pocket. "Wait." She said. She pulled out a cell phone and punched in a number. "Ranma?" She said when the phone was answered. "Guess who I ran into." She smiled. "He's standing right in front of me." She cupped her hand over the mouthpiece. "My he seems excited." She said to Ryoga. Nodoka nodded at something Ranma said. "Of course sweetheart." She said into the phone and hung up. "Sit." She told Ryoga. "Ranma will be here in a little while. In the meantime, I bet you're hungry."</p><p>By the time Ryoga was finishing his second Okonomiyaki the door opened and four people walked in. "Ryoga." Ranma called cheerfully.</p><p>"Hey Ranma, Akane, Ukyo." He noticed the fourth member of the group. "Who's your friend?"</p><p>"Ryoga this is Ting Li." Ranma said in introduction. "She's Joketsuzoku."</p><p>Ryoga appraised the woman in front of him. 'Hot.' Was his first assessment. He gave Ranma a slightly sour look. 'There's no way he can keep three of them satisfied.' He turned his attention back to Ting Li. 'I bet she'd love some attention.' He smiled. "I guess you're going to be around for a while then?" He asked.</p><p>Ting Li had made her own assessment and she liked what she saw. "Oh, I think I be around." She purred.</p><p>"That'll be more than we can say for Pig Boy, here." Ranma said. "You got a cell phone on ya?" He asked Ryoga. Ryoga nodded. "Good give me your number. We may have some work for you."</p><p>"For Nabs you mean." Ryoga replied. He handed Ranma a card. He gave Ting Li one as well. He nodded. "Sounds good."</p><p>"We got a job now if your interested." Ranma said as he pocketed the card. He looked around. "We'll talk later." He said. "I'm hungry."</p><p>"Hey Ran-chan." Ukyo called. "How about a Ran-chan special?"</p><p>"All right." Ranma said happily.</p><p>"Make me one Uk-chan." Akane said, "Please." She added in her Aoi baby voice.</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "Sure sugar." She grinned. "Two Ran-chan specials coming right up." She giggled as Ranma and Akane cheered loudly. "You guys." She said in pleased embarressment.</p><p>Ting Li sat down next to Ryoga. "Ranma say you pretty good." She smiled at Ryoga.</p><p>"I do alright." Ryoga replied. He smiled back.</p><p>"I thought the girl had taste." Akane whispered to Ranma. Ranma snorted and nodded. Akane turned and glared at Ryoga. "Don't tell him you told me." She said. "By the way, I'm still mad at you about that." She elbowed Ranma when he chuckled. Akane smiled sourly. It was soon after they first ran into Ryoga. The evening following Ting Li's debut in fact. Akane remembered that night. The three of them were sitting on the roof watching the sunset together. Ting Li was working that night.</p><p>"Oh don't worry Ranma." Akane remembered saying. "I'm sure we'll see Ryoga again." Ranma had been quiet and Akane assumed it was because Ryoga was back in their life. Akane was a bit apprehensive about it. Not that she thought Ranma was really attracted to Ryoga but there was something.</p><p>"It's not that Tomboy." Ranma had replied. "Well it is but not the way you think." Ranma grabbed the end of his pigtail and looked at it as he always did when he was thinking. "Look, I'm gonna tell ya something and your not gonna like it."</p><p>"Oh gods, you fucked him." Akane exclaimed. "That time in the tent." She looked at Ukyo. "Did I ever tell you I found them in a tent together?"</p><p>"No. No. No." Ranma waved his hands in denial. Then he chuckled. "Almost." He admitted. "But no." Ranma sighed. "It's something I've been keeping a secret since we first met."</p><p>"Secret?" Akane tilted her head and narrowed her eyes. "About Ryoga?" Ranma nodded. "It's why you call him Pig Boy isn't it?" Ranma nodded again. "Why are you telling me now?" She asked carefully.</p><p>"Cause I think you can handle it." Ranma replied honestly. "Probably coulda told ya long ago, probably shoulda, but until we saw Ryoga I didn't think about it."</p><p>"I'm going to be really, really pissed at you, aren't I?" Akane said.</p><p>"Pissed at me I can handle." Ranma smiled. "But you're gonna wanna kill Ryoga." Ranma looked down. "I would if it was me."</p><p>Akane swallowed a retort. 'He's worried about this.' She realized. 'Okay Akane time to show Ranma you can control your temper.' She chewed her lip. 'I hope.' Akane took a breath and let it out slowly. "Tell me." She said.</p><p>Ranma turned and looked into Akane's eyes. "You are really, really not gonna like this." He said. Ranma sighed. "He," Ranma swallowed in a suddenly dry throat. "He's been to Jusenkyo." He said quietly.</p><p>"Jusenkyo?" Akane said in surprise. "You mean, oh shit, oh shit. Pig Boy." Her voice shook in anger. "Pig Boy!"</p><p>"I'll kill him." Came a growl. It took Ranma a moment to realize it was Ukyo. "I knew there was something. I knew it." Ukyo snarled. "Why that low life, perverted creep."</p><p>"Stand in line." Akane snarled back. "PIG BOY." She slapped her own face in disgust. "Oh fucking hell." She snapped. "You've been telling me for years." She almost screamed. "Pig Boy!" Akane took a breath and held it fighting to get her anger under control. Akane looked passed Ranma to the seething Ukyo. 'Damn she's as mad as I am.' She thought. Akane took another breath and then another. Finally she seemed to relax. She looked at Ukyo. The woman who guarded her back was still growling. "Cool it Uk-chan." She grumbled.</p><p>"Cool it?" Ukyo said in disbelief. "That, that pervert was sleeping in your room. As a fucking pig." She said. "He was probably getting off on the whole thing."</p><p>"No doubt." Akane replied. "Now chill." She ordered. "I mean it Uk-chan."</p><p>Ukyo's mouth opened and closed a number of times. "You, you're not going to let him get away with it, are you?"</p><p>Akane snorted. "When pigs fly. And they're gonna." She replied. Akane took another deep breath and let it out slowly. "But I'm going to wait."</p><p>"Wow." Ranma said in amazement. "I thought for sure you'd be running across the rooftops looking for him." He said. "I was even more sure that I'd be in orbit right now."</p><p>"It was a close thing." Akane admitted. She took another calming breath. "Gods, I can't believe how stupid I am." Akane growled. "You've hinted enough times." She gave Ranma a sour look. "Let me guess, he made you promise not to tell me." She growled again when Ranma nodded. "Figures." She looked at Ukyo. "He's mine Uk-chan." She said. "Now stop growling and help me think of a way to get even."</p><p>"Are you sure you're alright Tomboy?" Ranma asked cautiously. "I mean, I deserve you being mad at me."</p><p>"Yeah you do." Akane replied. "And the only thing that's stopping me is what you said at the beginning." Akane smiled self-consciously. "You said you thought I could handle it and I don't want you to be wrong."</p><p>"Wow Tomboy." Ranma said in admiration. "I knew you were getting control of your temper but, wow."</p><p>Akane broke out of her reverie. "I can't believe Ukyo was madder than I was.' She looked at the Okonomiyaki chef. Ukyo was trying not to glare at Ryoga. Akane tapped the counter in front of her to get Ukyo's attention. "Cool it." She mouthed. Ukyo nodded reluctantly. "Well I'm stuffed." Akane patted her flat stomach.</p><p>"You should be, you ate three Ran-chan specials." Ukyo replied.</p><p>"I did?" Akane looked at her plate in surprise. "Well that explains it." She looked at Ranma. "I want to go see Daddy." Akane stood. "Ting Li." She said. "Keep a tight hold on Ryoga." She said. "We need to talk to him."</p><p>"Okay." Ting Li chirped cheerfully. She looped her arm through Ryoga's. "We ready."</p><p>"It was really great to see ya Mom." Ranma hugged his mother. "You gonna be at the Tendo's later?"</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "Right after your father gets off work." Nodoka smiled. "He'll probably complain when you see him but I think he actually enjoys working." Nodoka's smile became proud. "Why he even received a raise last week."</p><p>Ranma shook his head in disbelief. "Now I know the world is about to end." Ranma cracked. "Miracles are happening." Ranma gave his mother a kiss on the cheek and, with Akane and Ukyo flanking him, walked out of the restaurant. Ting Li and Ryoga followed behind.</p><p>"So what's this job you want done Ranma?" Ryoga called.</p><p>Ranma laughed.</p><p>End Chapter 3</p>
