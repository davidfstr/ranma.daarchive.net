</div><p>This story takes place two years after the wedding</p><p>Queen Rat Book 8</p><p>'Colors of the Night'</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>'Green, Peach and...Sumire'</p><p>Two extremely attractive young women walked down the street of a upscale section of Itabashi. One of the young women was Japanese whose classic good lucks were augmented by the expert application of makeup, well shaped eyebrows, perfectly manicured nails and a hair style that suggested both youth and sophistication. She wore an expensive and expertly tailored skirt and blouse covered by a short jacket all in shades of peach and green. The other girl was exotic even by Japanese standards. With her high cheekbones and shiny black hair she stood out even next to her attractive partner. Like the other young woman she wore a skirt and blouse also covered by a short jacket, the entire ensemble also in shades of peach and green but where the first girl wore clothes that were predominently peach, the second's clothing was predominently green. In the middle of each girl's forehead, just between their eyebrows, was affixed a small gem. The Japanese girl had a peach colored gem, while the exotic girl wore a green one.</p><p>For the last two years the two young women had been seen often in the neighborhood. If one had paid attention they would have noticed that the two women visited the same stores over and over but always in a different order and on different days. And though they usually left one or more of the stores with a package or some small item they never spent a lot of time in each of the stores. And sometimes they even left a package with the proprietor.</p><p>The bell rang over the door of one such shop as the two girls entered. It was your basic general store that sold candy, newspapers, cigars, wine and the like, though even a cursory glance would reveal that the store was somewhat sparsely stocked. The middle aged man behind the counter looked up. A broad smile came to his face. "Jewel. Gem." The man greeted the two women warmly. He pressed a key on his cash register and pulled out an envelope. "I expected you last week." He said as he offered the envelope to the exotic looking girl. "Nothing wrong, I hope."</p><p>"Nothing wrong, Mr. Kuragama." Pema replied. "Usagi just thought you might need little extra time." She said. She took the envelope. "She little worried about you, you know." Pema opened the envelope and quickly thumbed through the bills. She nodded.</p><p>"Please thank Usagi for her concern." The shopkeeper replied. He shrugged. "You know how it is with a new business." He said apologetically. "And Big Daddy has been very understanding." He sighed. "Maybe it was a mistake to open a store in this economy but I've..." He stopped. "I'm sure you don't want to hear about my problems."</p><p>"Oh no, Mr. Kuragama." Pema said. "How Big Daddy going help..."</p><p>"To help." Interrupted Kagomi. "You should say, 'to help'."</p><p>Pema smiled and nodded. "How Big Daddy going to help, if Big Daddy not know something wrong?" Pema said. Pema raised a finger and pulled out her cell phone. She quickly punched in a number. "Oh hi, Sugoi, it Jewel." She said warmly. "I at Mr. Kuragama store." She said in explanation. "Yes, he pay but business little slow." She nodded as she listened. "Oh, he will?' She said cheerfully. "That so wonderful." She exclaimed. "I tell Mr. Kuragama." She disconnected. "Good news, Mr. Kuragama." Pema said. "Big Daddy want talk to you." She looked at Kagomi. "That right, talk to you?" Kagomi nodded. Pema turned back to the shopkeeper. "Anyway, Big Daddy want talk to you, he have idea that you may like."</p><p>The shopkeeper paled. "I-I don't want Big Daddy to go to any trouble." He said hurriedly.</p><p>"It no trouble, Mr. Kuragama." Pema replied calmly. "It what you pay for." She said firmly. "Big Daddy only make money if you make money, so Big Daddy want you make, I mean, to make money."</p><p>The shopkeeper scratched his head. "I thought i was paying for..." He broke off. "Well I didn't think I was paying for that."</p><p>"You're confusing Big Daddy with...those other guys." Kagomi replied with a smile. Pema nodded vigorously in agreement. "Big Daddy..is well..." She shrugged helplessly. "Big Daddy is Big Daddy and there's no one else quite like him." She said. "Now, don't you worry, Big Daddy will think of something." The bell over the door rang and Kagomi turned to see who came in. She exchanged amused smiles with Pema as the customers were a group of teenaged boys around their age.</p><p>The group of teenaged boys walked around the store and pretended to shop. It was obvious they were pretending since they never took their eyes off of Pema and Kagomi. Pema and Kagomi giggled quietly and even Mr. Kuragama chuckled. One of the boys, bolder than the rest, walked over. "Hey." The boy said.</p><p>"Hello." Chorused Kagomi and Pema. The two girls looked at each other and giggled.</p><p>"Um, my buddes and I are, um, having, um a party and, and we were wondering..." The boy stammered out.</p><p>"Oh, you asking us to party?" Pema said cutely. The boy nodded. Pema tapped her lip with a perfectly manicured finger. "I not know, need to ask Big Daddy."</p><p>"B-b-big Daddy." The boy stammered, this time in fear. "Yo-you're a, a Daddy's Girl?" He squeaked. Pema and Kagomi nodded cheerfully. "Please...I-I meant no..no disrespect...I-I...oh crap."</p><p>Pema and Kagomi giggled. "Oh, you not worry." Pema said. "Jewel not tell Big Daddy." She raised a finger. "If you buy something from Mr. Kuragama, that is."</p><p>"I-i-is a soda okay?" The boy squeaked nervously.</p><p>"Soda fine." Pema said. "Big bottle." She called after the hurrying boy. A whispered conversation among the boys and lots of craning of necks and the pack of boys all bought sodas and quickly exited the store with a lot of backwards glances.</p><p>"You know, Pema." Kagomi whispered into Pema's ear. "If it wasn't for the fact that we get to sleep with Ranma on a regular basis I might get a bit upset."</p><p>"Oh?" Pema whispered back. "You really want little boy after being with Ranma?"</p><p>"It's not that." Kagomi shot back quickly. "It's just the scared looks they all get once they figure out who we are." Kagomi rolled her eyes. "Not that I blame them but...I kinda want a boyfriend that I don't have to share...with anyone but you that is." She and Pema broke into giggles. The bell over the door rang again and Kagomi and Pema turned.</p><p>Into the shop strode a tall, powerfully built young man in his mid to late twenties. He wore a white linen suit over a white shirt and white tie. He wore a white fedora but a long queue was visible hanging down his back. The man removed hiw sunglasses and smiled. With the sunglasses removed it was obvious the man was wearing eyeshadow and his eyebrows were too perfectly and femininely shaped to be the result of anything but frequent visits to a beauty parlor. Yet, there was nothing really effeminate about the man.</p><p>"Big Daddy." Chorused Pema and Kagomi happily. They both ran over to the man and turned their faces up for kisses that was quickly granted. The two girls leaned against Ranma and sighed when Ranma wrapped them in his powerful arms for a brief though heartfelt hug. Pema and Kagomi each took one of Ranma's hands and walked with him over to the awestruck shopkeeper.</p><p>"B-big Daddy." The shopkeeper bowed deeply. "You honor me but..." He began.</p><p>"Jewel said you needed help." Ranma interrupted. "And if Jewel wants me to help you, then I'm going to help you." Ranma looked around. "Usagi was right, you need more stock and more variety." Ranma said. "Probably could use another cooler." He said. "And some specialty items." Ranma said musingly.</p><p>The shopkeeper sighed. "Everything you say is true." He said. "But..." The shopkeeper shrugged moodily. "It takes money." He said. "I spent everything I had just to get this much." The man said. "And it's not that business is really all that bad, just..."</p><p>"Just not enough?" Ranma asked. The shopkeeper nodded. "Yeah." This time it was Ranma who shrugged. "Look Mr. Kuragama." Ranma said. "I'm a business man." He said. "You got a nice looking store in a decent location." He nodded toward the door. "Good foot traffic." He said. "You just gotta get them in here." He said. "And the best way to get them in here is to give them something, anything, that they could buy."</p><p>"Money, Big Daddy, it all takes money." The shopkeeper tilted his head. "Are you thinking about...investing?"</p><p>"Only if you want me to." Ranma replied. "You need, what? Two, three million yen?" He asked. The shopkeeper nodded slowly. "What's that worth to you?" Ranma asked. "Not to mention I know where I can get some first class merchandise at a decent..." Ranma smiled. "Very decent price." Ranma walked over to the shopkeeper and put his hand on the man's shoulder. "I take care of my own, Mr. Kuragama."</p><p>The shopkeeper looked into Ranma's eyes. He looked passed the makeup and the shaped eyebrows. The shopkeeper licked dry lips. "I...I..." He stopped. "That's about a third of what I already put into this business." The man almost desperately projected honesty to the tall man in front of him as he instinctively realized that this...person in front of him could mean the difference between just survival and success. Just as he instinctively trusted him. "maybe a little bit more." He added.</p><p>"Not enough to count." Ranma replied. He smiled. "Twenty-five percent, then?" He said it as a suggestion but the shopkeeper knew that the offer was generous almost beyond belief. The shopkeeper bowed deeply. "Excellent." Ranma said in response. "My lawyer will be here in the morning." He took a cell phone out of his coat pocket. "In the meantime..." He punched in a number. "Hi Makoto." He said when the call was answered. "Is Genji around?" Ranma chuckled. "Oh, I see." He said. "Well see if you can tear him away from Yuki for a second." Ranma laughed at something. "I didn't mean it literally." Ranma laughed again. "Genji!" Ranma sang into the phone. "I found you another outlet." He said into the phone. "He needs everything." Ranma said. "And another cooler." Ranma nodded. Ranma then gave the address to the store. "Thanks, Genji." He said. Ranma disconnected. "There will be a delivery tomorrow."</p><p>"Delivery?" The shopkeeper croaked out. He swallowed to moisten his throat. Everything was happening too fast and his head was spinning. "Delivery?" He asked again.</p><p>"Like I told Genji, you need everything." Ranma replied. He smiled. "Tomorrow...you'll have... everything."</p><p>The shopkeeper looked at Ranma in shock as full realization struck. HIs mouth worked soundlessly for a long moment. With an effort he closed his mouth. 'The rumors are true.' He thought almost gleefully. 'And if those rumors are true then, then maybe the others are true too.' The shopkeeper bowed again. "Thank you." He said over and over.</p><p>Pema looked at the bowing Mr. Kuragama then looked at Ranma. 'And so my god saves yet another.' She thought proudly. She leaned her head against Ranma's arm and sighed happily.</p><p>"We gotta go, Mr. Kuragama." Ranma said. "Now that we're partners, you'll be seeing a lot more of me."</p><p>"You'll always be welcome." The shopkeeper replied. He escorted Ranma and the two young girls to the door and watched as they entered a limo that was waiting for them. The shopkeeper watched the limo drive away before re-entering the store. The shopkeeper looked at the currently sparsely stocked shelves and imagined them full. A wry smile came to his face. "Decent price." He snorted. "No doubt." He rubbed his hands together in anticipation. "takes care of his own." He laughed. "If even half of what I've heard is true, I'm going to be rich."</p><p>Pema and Kagomi leaned against Ranma as the limo drove through the streets of Itabashi. The limo and driver actually belonged to the Ice Queen but Ranma used them whenever he was in his Big Daddy presona. As Nabiki put it, how were people supposed to believe Ranma was a successful and dangerous Yakusa enforcer if he walked everywhere he went. Not that Ranma really needed a lot of convincing, there were certain advantages to having a limo. One of which was that Pema, and by extension, Kagomi, liked being driven in one.</p><p>Ranma looked down at the young Tibetan girl. Gone was the emaciated and frightened girl that he had found chained in a warehouse. The young girl, no young woman, leaning against him was by every and any measure imaginable beautiful almost beyond belief. Yet, and almost despite her beauty, Pema remained unchanged in one important area. She was still the same unspoiled and loving girl that he had brought home. 'Everyone loves her.' Ranma thought. He snorted. 'Even Chikato.'</p><p>Pema looked up. "Ranma?"</p><p>"Just thinking about something, Punkin." Ranma replied. "I'm glad you called about Mr. Kuragama." He added. "He really was struggling."</p><p>"He very nice man." Pema replied.</p><p>"Kind of reminded me of gramps." Kagomi added. Referring to her grandfather.</p><p>"Speaking of your grandfather." Ranma said. "How's he enjoying his retirement."</p><p>Kagomi laughed. "He hates it." She said. "He says he's bored." She snapped her fingers. "Hey, I bet Gramps would love to help out Mr. Kuragama." She said.</p><p>"Not bad, Kagomi." Ranma said approvingly. "Give him a call later." He said. "Oh, that reminds me, Kodachi called." He said. "Kiko's having a party at the mansion this weekend and she wanted to know if the two of you would attend."</p><p>"Oh, like I'll say no to spending a weekend at the mansion." Kagomi replied. "Besides, we haven't seen the shrimp in almost a month."</p><p>Pema nodded in agreement. "You tell Ms. Kuno we very happy...to help." She said. "I miss Kiko." She added.</p><p>"Good." Ranma replied. "I'll let Kodachi know."</p><p>Kagomi leaned forward and caught Pema's eyes. She nodded toward Ranma with a pleading look. Pema hid a giggle. "Ranma?" Pema asked.</p><p>"Yeah, punkin?" Ranma replied.</p><p>"Since we not be home this weekend." Pema said. She took a breath. "Can we sleep with you tonight?"</p><p>"Please." Added Kagomi.</p><p>"Now, you girls know you gotta ask Akane and Ukyo first." Ranma chided. He curled his arms to bring the two girls closer to him. "And...when they say yes..." He smiled when Pema and Kagomi squealed happily. "Course you know the Tomboy is going to demand equal time." He said offhandedly.</p><p>Pema giggled. "Pema know." She said cheerfully. "You going watch like last time?" She asked in teasing tones. "Pema like when Ranma watch."</p><p>"Pervert." Kagomi called from the other side of Ranma.</p><p>"Oh look who talking." Pema shot back. The two young women leaned forward, looked at each other and giggled. The leaned back against Ranma and sighed. Pema closed her eyes and just enjoyed her proximity to Ranma. After four years with Ranma she still had trouble believing how her life had turned out. Four years ago she had been a frightened, lonely, drug addicted, though not by choice, little girl with no hope for any future. Now the future seemed endless. 'Mama would be so surprised that her little Pema walks with gods.' She thought. Thoughts of her mother brought the accompanying thoughts of the rest of her family. Even knowing that her parents had sold her did not diminish her feelings for them. She still missed them. Pema wiped her eyes.</p><p>"You okay, punkin?" Ranma asked in concern.</p><p>Pema opened her eyes. "I okay, Ranma." She said with a sad smile. "Just thinking of home." She said in explanation. She laughed a little sadly. "Sometimes I wish I see mama again." She said. "Let her know, her Pema okay." She shook her head. "But that not happen." She looked up at Ranma. "Do you think Mama be proud of her Pema?" She asked almost plaintively.</p><p>"I think your Mama would be very proud of her Pema." Ranma replied. "I know I am." He said. "Anyone who really knows you would be proud of you." He said. "Right, Kagomi?"</p><p>"Right." Kagomi said supportively. "And if your Mom is anything like you, I bet she misses you all the time." Kagomi declared.</p><p>"You really think so, Kagomi?" Pema asked. "Oh, I hope she not too sad." She said. "I no want Mama...to be sad."</p><p>Kagomi shook her head. "That's our Pema for you." She said to Ranma. "More love in her little finger than any ten people's whole bodies."</p><p>"I don't think anyone's gonna disagree with that." Ranma declared. "Oh, we're almost home." He said. "Better put a smile on your face, Pema." Ranma said warningly. "You know Uk-chan will blame me if you're sad." Ranma rubbed the back of his head as if rubbing a bump. "That spatula can hurt." He said plaintively. He smiled when Pema giggled. 'That's better." He said approvingly.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Good evenimg and welcome to Japan Tonight." The pretty reporter said into the camera. "I'm your host. Saatchi Kato." The reporter swiveled her chair to face another camera. "Before we get to today's stories, I have an announcement." She said. "This will be my last show for the next four weeks." She said. "Starting Monday, Japan Tonight will be hosted by our very own Mitsui Oh." The camera panned over to the pretty and bespectacled meterologist who bowed to the camera. The camera returned to the reporter. "I know Mitsui will do a fine job." The reporter turned to look off camera. "And I am coming back, Mitsui." She scolded teasingly.</p><p>The reporter shifted back to the main camera and looked at her notes. A montage of a pretty girl of about twelve appeared behind her. The pictures of the young girl were of her in various locations but the majority of the pictures were of the girl wearing leotards. One picture moved to center and enlarged. It was of the girl, again in leotards and holding a trophy over her head, a broad and radiant smile on her face. "Kiko Kuno." The reporter said in identification. "Not since another Kuno retired from gymnastics has any female athlete so captured the public's imagination." The picture on the screen was replaced by one of Kiko Kuno and an older woman wearing a half veil. "The adopted daughter of Kodachi Kuno continues her domination of female gymnastics." The reporter shook her head. "And no, despite the rumors to the contrary, Kiko Kuno is not Kodachi Kuno's illegitimate daughter."</p><p>The reporter swiveled to face another camera. "This reporter wants to go on record in not only denying these rumors but to say; shame, shame on those who persist in spreading such lies." She said sternly. "It's hurtful not only to the Black Widow but to Kiko Kuno herself." She said. "I know that the Black Widow has her detractors, misguided though they may be, but to attack someone, a child, who's only crime is to emulate a loved parent, adopted or otherwise..." She waved a finger at the camera. "Shame."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Saatchi Kato unhooked her lapel mike and stood as one of her assistants hurried over. "There's a limo here for you, Ms. Kato." The aide said breathlessly. "And wait until you see the driver." The aide gushed as she fanned herself with a hand. "Hot."</p><p>Saatchi Kato chuckled. "No doubt." She said dryly. "Now remember, I'm not going to have my cellphone with me." She said. "But I will check my email at least once a day." She said. "But other than that, I'm unavailable." She said. "No one, I repeat, no one is to know where I am going."</p><p>"I don't know where you're going." Complained the aide. 'What if there's an emergency?"</p><p>"Handle it." Saatchi replied. "Now I really must go." She said and strode off toward the wings of the studio. A tall, thin and saturnine looking man in chauffeur liveries was waiting for her. 'Hot is right.' Saatchi thought. The man bowed and then silently beckoned her to follow him. Saatchi followed the man out of the building and to a parked limo. 'Rented." Noted the reported. 'Ms. Kuno is really trying to keep this secret." The chauffeur opened the passenger door and waited for the reporter to enter before closing the door. He entered the drivers seat.</p><p>"No luggage, I see." The chauffeur commented.</p><p>"Ms. Kuno said I wouldn't need it." Saatchi replied a touch nervously.</p><p>"She was correct." The chauffeur replied. "All that you need will be provided." He said. "I am Yoshi." He said in introduction. "I hope you won't mind a personal comment." He said. He started the limo and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>"Personal comment?" Saatchi asked.</p><p>"Today's broadcast." Yoshi said in explanation. "I think I speak for all of Ms. Kuno's retainers when I say, we very much appreciated your defense of Miss Kiko." He said. "Miss Kiko may not be Ms. Kuno's daughter of her body but she is her daughter of her spirit and Ms Kuno is fiercely protective of Miss Kiko." He smiled into the mirror. "As are we all."</p><p>"I just thought it was wrong, that's all." Saatchi replied.</p><p>"It was wrong." Yoshi agreed. "We'll be changing cars at the next corner." He said abruptly. The car made the turn and then turned into an open garage door. "Please wait until the door closes before exiting." Yoshi instructed. Yoshi exited the car and then, when the garage door had closed, opened the passenger door.</p><p>The reporter stepped out of the lime and was waved toward a second limosine. Yoshi opened the door and waved the reporter in. As the reporter entered the limo she realized it was already occupied. The woman in the car was of apparent middle age but was dressed and made up in the style of a professional geisha.</p><p>"Good evening, Ms. Kato." The Geisha said. She patted the seat next to her. "Please sit." When the reporter sat down the Geisha tapped the window that separated the front of the car from the rear compartment with a fan. Moments later the limo started up and drove out a second garage door. "Wine?' The Geisha asked in regal tones. She smiled. "Or something stronger." She said impishly. "Forgive me, but you look like you could use something more...bracing."</p><p>"You got that right." The reporter replied. "I'm not used to all this...cloak and dagger." She smiled wryly. "But then again, I'm not used to riding in limos either." She said. "Scotch, if you have it." A moment later the reporter was leaning back against the seat cushion with a drink in hand. "You know, you look familiar." She said musingly. "Have we met?"</p><p>"Several times, dear." The Geisha replied. "Though I didn't have..." She waved a hand to indicate her face. "My business face on." The Geisha laughed at the expression on the reporter's face. "My son bet me that you'd never guess without a clue." She smiled. "That was your clue."</p><p>"Son?" The Reporter peered intently at the Geisha. Suddenly her eyes shot wide open. "Mrs. Saotome?" She squeaked. The Geisha nodded. "You...you..." She shook her head. "Damn, you look good."</p><p>"Thank you." Nodoka replied. "I do try."</p><p>"You succeed." The reporter replied. The reporter's mouth dropped open as a second realization hit her. "You're that Miss Nodoka?" She exclaimed. The reporter looked out through the tinted windows. "We-we're going to The Club?"</p><p>"Well you did say you wanted an exclusive behind the scenes." Nodoka said with a laugh. "And what better way than to...shall we say...live the life?"</p><p>"Are you...I mean...I'm not exactly unrecognizable." The reporter pointed out. 'Live the life?' She thought.</p><p>"Oh, don't worry, once Koko gets her hands on you, even your own mother wouldn't recognize you." Nodoka said confidently. "The woman is a wizard with hair and makeup." She waved her hand to her face. "She does my makeup." She pointed out.</p><p>"Koko?" The reporter echoed.</p><p>"Don't worry, you'll meet her." Nodoka promised. "Now, before we get there, there are a number of things we need to discuss." Nodoka said in business-like terms. "First, you will not be allowed to take pictures of the clientele or use their names in your...report." She admonished. "Our clientele do relish their...anonymity."</p><p>"I-I..." She sighed. "Okay."</p><p>"Good." Nodoka replied. "Second, you will live and work at the Club." She smiled. "Trust me, it will not be a hardship." She said. "Nor will you be allowed out of the club without a chaperon." The reporter nodded. "Third, it is not only Kodachi that is taking a great risk by allowing this, what you may learn could affect Nabiki as well." She tilted her head at the reporter. "Yet both of them seem to believe you will be...sympathetic."</p><p>"Nabiki?" The reporter questioned. "Nabiki?" She repeated. "You don't mean..." The reporter gulped her drink. "The Ice Queen?" She squeaked out. Nodoka nodded. "I-I...oh lord...really?" Nodoka nodded again. The reporter extended her glass. "Could I have another?" She asked plaintively.</p><p>"Having reservations, dear?" Nodoka asked. "We could just turn around and..."</p><p>"No!" Exclaimed the reporter. "Please, no." She said urgently. "I was just surprised." She explained. "I mean I know that Ms Kuno and the Ice Queen..." The reporter shut her mouth with a click. "I'm babbling, aren't I?" She said apologetically. "If they're so concerned, then why was the offer made?" She asked.</p><p>"It is a puzzle." Agreed Nodoka. "Yet, as I said, they believe you will be sympathetic." She said. "Finally, and this is my own condition, while you are at the club, you will do as you are told, with no questions." She said. "Nor will you interfere with any of the...services provided." Nodoka sighed. "Honestly, I just don't know what those two were thinking when they agreed to this."</p><p>The reporter looked at her drink. "In the last six years, the crime rate in and around Tokyo has decreased an average of five percent a year, every year." She said quietly. "In the past four years." She continued. "Unemployment in the Tokyo area, but mostly in Nerima and Itabashi, has decreased by nearly twelve percent." She took a large slug of her drink. "In that same period of time, Nabiki Tendo went from being a paroled criminal to one of the richest women in Japan." She pointed out. "And the current Lady Kuno."</p><p>"And you think, what?" Nodoka asked in amused tones. "That Nabiki had something to do with it?" She waved a dismissive hand.</p><p>The reporter looked hard at Nodoka. "I think, Lady Kuno, the Ice Queen, is the most powerful woman in Japan." She said in equally hard tones. "So, yes, I do think Nabiki had a lot to do with it." She placed the glass down in the cup holder on the arm rest. "Just as I think that she has the backing, or at least a hands off, from the authorities."</p><p>Nodoka leaned back against the seat back."Go on."</p><p>The reporter chuckled. "Not going to deny it are you?" She said. Nodoka just smiled. "And I think that Ms. Kuno is central to Lady Kuno's operations.." She said. "I want to know how she's doing it." She said. "Not for a story, not for ratings." The reporter explained. "I just want to know." She said. "I need to know."</p><p>"Need?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>The reporter nodded. "If I know how she's doing it, then I can...prepare for the inevitable rumors that will arise." The reporter picked up the glass and swirled the contents. She sipped some of the scotch flavored ice melt.</p><p>Nodoka nodded as if something had just become clear. "So, Nabiki was correct once again." She murmured. "You've been very honest with me, Ms. Kato, so I will be equally honest with you." She said. "The moment we reach the club, there is no turning back." She said. "This is not a game, Ms. Kato." She said. "If you are to become...a member of our organization there must be no doubts, no question of your loyalty."</p><p>"I'll do whatever is necessary, Mrs. Saotome." The reporter promised.</p><p>Nodoka smiled. "We'll see, Ms. Kato, oh indeed, we will see." She said. "And, from now on, you will address me as...Auntie."</p><p>The reporter blinked in surprise. "Auntie?" She asked. Nodoka nodded. The reporter hesitated for a moment then bowed her head. "Yes, Auntie."</p><p>Nodoka's smile widened. "Excellent." She looked up as the limo slowed. "Ah, we are almost at the club."</p><p>The limo turned into an alleyway that led to the rear of the club. A moment later the passenget door opened and the saturnine Yoshi reached a hand in to escort first Nodoka then the reporter from the rear of the limo. Yoshi led the way to a door and opened it for the two women. "I will leave you here." He said. He bowed to Nodoka. "As always, a pleasure seeing you Auntie." He bowed to the reporter. "Ma'am."</p><p>Nodoka and the reporter walked through the rear entrance and to a second door. Upon opening the door they found a pretty red head waiting for them. Around the red heads neck hung an unusual pendant, a gold spider with ruby eyes, clutching a black pearl. "Ah, Suki." Nodoka greeted the woman. "Is everything in readiness?"</p><p>"Everything is as you instructed, Auntie." Suki replied. Her hand reached to the pendant and caressed it momentarily. "We put her in the rear suite on the third floor." She looked at the reporter curiously but didn't say anything. She returned her attention to Nodoka. "Koko is on her way and will meet us at the suite."</p><p>"Excellent, Suki." Nodoka replied. She nodded toward the pendant around the red heads neck. "I think I speak for all the girls when I say, you've earned it."</p><p>Suki's eyes glistened slightly. "Thank you, Auntie." Suki bowed and waved the two women on. "I've taken the liberty of selecting some of your clothes." She said to the reporter. "If you need anything altered, please let me know."</p><p>"Suki has a talent for tailoring." Nodoka added.</p><p>"Miki and Fumie will come by later to do the orientation." Suki continued. "Makoto and Yuki will be in later, Aoi and Ami are already here and Rei will be entertaining the diners in the outer club." Suki reported. They came to a door. Suki opened the door revealing it to actually being the entrance to an elevator. Suki waited for the two women to enter before pressing a button. The elevator rose smoothly and silence descended as the elevator took them to the third floor. Finally the elevator stopped and Suki opened the door.</p><p>"Oh, my." Exclaimed the reporter as she exited the elevator and into a lounge. The room was dimly lit but bright enough to make out most of the details, such as the walls being covered in a red and textured wallpaper, the two comfortable couchs in a rich chocolate brown and the small but well stocked bar in the corner. The lounge was empty but soft, smoky jazz wafted in from hidden speakers. She also noticed that there were four doors spaced equidistant around the room.</p><p>"This room is shared by any of the other...guests...in their suites at the time." Nodoka informed the reporter. "Right now there is only one other guest though I doubt you will meet him." Nodoka said. "But if you do, he wishes to be addressed as Mr. Smith."</p><p>"You're kidding." The reporter said in a incredulous disbelief.</p><p>"It's a little joke of his." Nodoka replied. She waved at Suki to lead. The red head nodded and went to the door across from the elevator. "This will be your suite." Nodoka said as Suki opened the door. "I do hope you like it."</p><p>The reporter walked through the door and into a small vestibule that had a small bench and a closet. The space under the bench held a dozen pairs of plush looking house slippers. A new and still wrapped pair sat on top of the bench. The reporter chuckled and slipped off her shoes and into the new slippers. The action copied by Nodoka and Suki, with, she noted, specific slippers from under the bench.</p><p>With slippered feet she entered the large main room. Like the outer lounge there was a smokey and sensual feel to the room. Like the outer lounge, there was a wet bar in a corner. Near to the bar was a small, delicately carved, though obviously very functional desk and chair. A plush and dark green leather sofa and a chair bracketed a low, glass table was set up closer to the opposite room, giving the room the impression of actually being two separate rooms.</p><p>"And over here is the kitchenette." Suki said and walked over to set of doors. She slid those apart to reveal a small but functional kitchen. "The kitchen is usually restocked every Tuesday and Friday." Suki informed the reporter. "But you can always request something at any time or..." She walked to a grill set in the wall. "The kitchen is open until 4 a.m. every day."</p><p>Suki then walked over to another pair of doors and slid them apart to reveal a separate room. Suki went to one blank wall and pulled on a large metal handle set halfway up the wall. The wall tilted down to reveal a king size murphy bed. "Nice." The reporter breathed as Suki raised the bed to hide it away once again. The reporter looked around all the drawers and cabinets were built in so there was nothing for the bed to avoid but, the reporter noted, there were chairs and small tables stacked against the corners furthest from the bed. She also noticed, with some touch of avarice, that that same far wall held a built in large, flat screen television and what was obviously a computer keyboard. "Very nice." The reporter said. She noticed another door and walked over to it and opened the door. "Nice." She said again when the bathroom was revealed. "Gold?" She asked.</p><p>"Gold plated." Nodoka replied with a small smile.</p><p>The door to the suite opened and a woman in her mid thirties entered. "Sorry I'm late, Auntie." She said. "Hey Suki." She held a metal case in one hand.</p><p>"Hi Koko." Suki greeted the newcomer. "and you're not late."</p><p>"Koko this is our guest." Nodoka said. "Ah, I knew I forgot to mention something." She said. She turned to the reporter. "While you are here, you will be referred to as Sumire." She said. "Sumire." Nodoka continued. "This is Koko."</p><p>The newcomer walked over to the reporter. As she approached the reporter was able to discern a faint line running the length of her right cheek and a slight upward twisting of one lip. "Sumire, huh?" Koko said in amusement. "Well let me look at you." She reached out with a hand and grabbed a hold of the reporters chin and turned her face from side to side. "You look paler on television." She said. "And thinner."</p><p>"You recognize me." The reporter stated.</p><p>"Well, yeah." Koko replied. "Met you at the wedding, too." Koko pursed her lips. "I think we'll go with something bold around the eyes in order to distract from the rest of your face." She said in decision. "Your hair is too short to do anything with." She murmured.</p><p>"A wig perhaps." Nodoka suggested.</p><p>"I'd like to avoid using a wig unless I have to." Koko demurred. She pointed to a chair. "Sit." She ordered. "Sumire huh?" She repeated. "I think that's Auntie's way of suggesting a theme for you." She grinned. "Violet would look good on you." Koko tapped her lips with a finger. "Violet eyeshadow, Violet lipstick." Koko snapped her fingers. "And a domino." She said. "Suki, go down to the costume room, there's a..."</p><p>"I think I know where they are, Koko.": The redhead said helpfully. "I'll be back in no time." Suki hurried out of the suite.</p><p>"And while Suki gets the mask, I'll pick out your outfit for tonight's debut." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Tonight?" The reporter exclaimed. "But... but...it's...it's...late." She stopped as Koko shook her head. "Not late?"</p><p>"It's early, Sumire." Koko said. "The club isn't even half full."</p><p>Ky's club. Tokyo's most exclusive and enigmatic club. Though Kodachi had made many and substantial modifications over the passed four years it remained true to Ky's original vision. Any fan of Casablanca would immediately recognize the source of Ky Young Ji's inspiration. Large ceiling fans spun lazily from the ceiling and iron railings separated and defined individual sections. One side of the club was dominated by a stage and one of the most complete and expensive media systems available. One section contained a number of gaming tables, while another contained the long wooden bar. Here and there individual booths, some large enough to hold a dozen, others barely large enough for two. A very intimate two. A dance floor fronted the stage and was surrounded by it's own wrought iron railings. And, in keeping with the theme, a lone pianist, a black man in his later thirties or early forties, wearing a white shirt with thin green stripes with green garters on the sleeves, dark green pants and a matching dark green derby, tinkled lazily on the piano. Every so often one of the many waitresses and hostesses would go over to the pianist and request a song. The patrons who would request a song seemed swept up in the period atmosphere and the music requested was invariably from that same period</p><p>Ron Jackson, RJ to his friends, loved his job. Twenty years earlier, dissatisfied with both his life and the society in which he lived, he had emigrated to Japan. When he first arrived, with Japanese phrase book in hand, and little else, he had wandered into a local nightclub and, seeing that the club had a piano, had started playing. Ten minutes after he had started playing the manager of the club placed a large empty brandy snifter on the piano and then very ostentatiously, placed a large denomination yen note in the glass, patted Ron on the shoulder and walked away. He played in that club almost every night for the next five years before leaving for a better opportunity. The manager of the club had cried the night he left but threw Ron a large farewell party nonetheless. Sometimes Ron found he regretted having left but knew he couldn't return.</p><p>Ron Jackson changed jobs two more times before Kodachi Kuno walked into the club he had been playing at and, after listening to him the entire night, made him an offer just before she left. Ron had visited the club the next night. Ron took one look at the club, sat down at the piano and began to play. When Kodachi Kuno walked over to the piano and placed a large empty brandy snifter on the piano and then placed a large denomination yen note in the glass, Ron knew he was home.</p><p>"Hey RJ baby." Called one the hostesses, a pretty blond in her mid twenties. Around her neck she wore a pendant identical to the one worn by Suki.</p><p>"Hey, Ami." Ron Jackson replied. He smiled as the hostess sat on the wide piano bench next to him and leaned against him. 'Second best part of my job.' He thought in satisfaction. Ron began playing a love song for Ami. Softly singing along with the melody so only Ami could hear. Ron's baritone voice was suited for love songs and he used it to his full advantage. Ron knew exactly what happened in the club, and what the girls did, but as far as Ron was concerned that was just a perk of the job and would avail himself of a good number of the girls services whenever possible. Especially since a good number of the girls agreed with him and, to Ron's greater satisfaction, never charged him. Though he ended up, more often then not, with Ami.</p><p>Ami kissed Ron on the cheek when the song ended. "I'll see you on your break, RJ Baby." She said impishly. She smiled at the anticipatory look in the pianist's eyes. "Oh, nearly forgot, new girl is showing tonight." She said. "She's a 'special'."</p><p>"Another actress slumming?" Ron asked with a grin. "I mean, researching for a role." He added in amused tones.</p><p>"Close." Ami replied with a laugh. Ami stood. "See you on break, lover." She repeated and hip swayed away. Ami walked over to the concierge station where another pretty woman, this time a brunette, was manning a computer console. "Hey Miki."</p><p>"Hey, girl." Miki replied. She too wore a spider pendant. "Perfect timing, I need to go upstairs and check on our guest." She said in anticipation. "I can't wait to see what Koko's come up with this time." Miki walked away from the concierge station and Ami took her place. Ami watched Miki go before turning her attention to the console in front of her.</p><p>Miki walked to the back of the club where she was met by another young woman with light brown haird and a spider pendant around her neck. "Ready to bring out the new girl, Fumie?" She asked. The other woman nodded with a grin. "What do you think the bids'll be like?" The two women entered the elevator.</p><p>"Well, even without Koko's magic, she's attractive as hell." Fumie replied. "However, since no one's supposed to know who she is, I'd say somewhere in the three hundred thousand range." She said. "The real question is; will she accept a bid?" Fumie and Miki giggled.</p><p>"No one's turned down the opportuniity for...the experience...yet." Miki reminded Fumie. The two women giggled again. "But, in this case, we'll see." The elevator stopped and the two women exited. As before the outer lounge was empty and they headed directly to the door to the reporter's suite. They entered without knocking. They changed into slippers and entered the main part of the suite.</p><p>Koko looked up from where she was working on a woman who was sitting in a chair with her back to them. "Good timing, girls." She reached over to a small table and lifted up a violet piece of material that she then affixed to the woman's face and tied in the back. "Stand up, Sumire." Koko instructed. The woman in the chair stood and turned around.</p><p>Miki and Fumie stared at the woman before them. From head to toe she was dressed in violet. Violet dress, violet shoes, and the violet face mask. The eye holes in the mask were large and revealed the violet eye shadow and violet tinged eyelashes. The dress which was long in the back turned out to be short in front to reveal violet colored sheer stockings and the straps of a violet garter belt that held up the stockings. Her elaborately braided hair had been given violet highlights and her skin dusted with a faint violet powder. Fumie leaned over to Miki. "Five hundred thousand."</p><p>Nodoka stood from the couch she had been sitting in. "Well ladies, shall we introduce our latest...offering?"</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The elevator door opened and six women stepped out. One, the redhead, waved a goodbye and headed off in a separate direction. Of the remaining five, two women, one dressed as a Geisha and the other dressed in a expensive black and gold kimono but without the makeup of a Geisha flanked the other three women. Of the remaining three, the two women each took a hand of the woman in the center, a woman dressed in violet.</p><p>The five women walked from the elevator and toward the stage. Even before the five women reached the stage the general noise and rumble of conversation had quieted to a low anticipatory murmur. The two women holding the woman in violet's hands ascended the stage and walked to center stage while the two women in kimono walked over to Ron Jackson and his piano. At a nod from Nodoka, Ron started playing a familiar melody and several members of the audience could be seen mouthing the words to "As Time Goes By".</p><p>Nodoka picked up a microphone that was sitting on a small stand while Koko leaned against the piano. Nodoka waited until the song ended before raising the microphone. "Good evening." She said in an amplified voice. The audience could be heard to respond with 'Good evening, Miss Nodoka'. Nodoka smiled. "My friends, and you are my friends, My friends I give you..." She waved a languid hand toward the stage. "Sumire."</p><p>With the introduction the woman in violet, after a whispered instruction from Miki, curtsied to the audience. Miki and Ami led the woman in violet to each of the corners of the stage where after another whispered instruction the woman in violet curtsied again. By the time they reached the third designated spot, the woman in violet curtsied on her own.</p><p>"Ohmigod, I can't believe I'm doing this." The reporter whispered nervously.</p><p>"Doing what, Sumire?" Fumie replied. "All you're doing is being introduced as the latest hostess at Ky's club." She said in innocent tones. "All the new girls do this."</p><p>"You know what I mean." The reporter whispered back. "I feel like, like...they think I'm..."</p><p>"Shh." Hissed Miki. "You're not supposed to talk." She said stern yet amused tones. "Now smile." Miki put a wide smile on her face and she and Fumie led the reporter to another designated spot on the stage where the reporter once again curtsied. They returned to the center stage where the reporter curtsied once again. The audience erupted into applause.</p><p>From her vantage point at center stage, the reporter watched as the hostesses began circulating around the room to the separate tables. A unheard exchange would occur and more often than not they would leave an envelope with one or more people at the table. The reporter continued to stand there for another long minute before Miki and Fumie led her off the stage. The reporter found herself led from table to table, though never for more than a few moments before she'd be led to another table and other clients.</p><p>Finally she was led to a table set in a deep alcove that was already occupied by Nodoka and Koko. "Please sit, Sumire." Nodoka said. "Champagne?" She asked while offering a tall fluted glass. The reporter sat and gratefully accepted the drink. "Enjoying yourself?" Nodoka asked in arch tones.</p><p>The reporter took a log sip of her champagne before replying. "All the girls do that?"</p><p>"Well the tradition has evolved somewhat over time." Nodoka said. "But basically, yes."</p><p>The reporter took another long sip of the champagne. "It's a strange feeling." She said almost musingly.</p><p>"What is, dear?" Nodoka replied in knowing tones."The attention?" Nodoka continued. "I'm surprised, a famous personality such as yourself should be used to being...admired."</p><p>"Not like..." She nodded toward the other tables. "That." She said. "And don't give me that innocent act." The reporter said though in surprisingly affectionate tones. "Auntie." A slow smile came to the woman's face. "One man was practically drooling."</p><p>"Client, dear, we say client." Nodoka said in mildly reproving tones.</p><p>The reporter snorted quietly. "Of course you do." She said. Her smile became slightly wider. "I recognized one of the people I was introduced to." She said. "Though he wasn't using his real name." She said. The reporter laughed.</p><p>"Not all that unusual, dear." Nodoka replied. She looked up as another blond approached. "Ah, Aoi." She said. "Aoi this is Sumire."</p><p>Aoi smiled in greeting. "There was great interest in Sumire." Aoi said. She handed Nodoka a stack of envelopes. She looked at the reporter. "Especially among several women." She said.</p><p>"You're joking." The reporter exclaimed. She paused. "Several?" She asked.</p><p>Aoi grinned. "Three to be exact." She said.</p><p>"You're joking!' The reporter repeated.</p><p>"I think it's the mask." Koko said in cheerful tones.</p><p>"This is a test, isn't it?" The reporter asked suddenly.</p><p>"It's all a test, dear." Nodoka replied. "From the moment you got into the limo, it's been a test." She said. She picked up the envelopes. "This too is a test." She said. "Though a different kind of test." She said. "You may refuse these and still continue with...your research." She said. "Not all of Ms. Kuno's girls...entertain."</p><p>"Ms. Kuno's girls?" Echoed the reporter.</p><p>"The female inner circle." Explained Nodoka. "Those women who...share a common background." She said, "That is where you want to be, isn't it?" Her tone became challenging.</p><p>"Yes." The reporter replied. She nodded toward the envelopes. "And that's how I get in?" She asked.</p><p>Nodoka opened an envelope. "This is just one way in." She said. Nodoka extracted the folded paper inside the envelope and scrutinized it. She smiled and offered the piece of paper to the reporter. "Though a very...siignificant way in."</p><p>The reporter tentatively took the piece of paper. She didn't look at it at first. Instead she looked at the women in and around the table. They all seemed to be holding their breaths. 'Despite what she said, this is the real test.' She thought. She looked down at the paper. Her eyes reflected her confusion. On the paper was a name that she vaguely recalled from her introductions and a number. It took her a moment to realize that the number represented an amount. "This is...for what?" She asked slowly.</p><p>"For your...company." Nodoka replied. She opened another envelope and looked at the paper within. "Maybe this is a more...acceptable number." She said and passed the second bid over to the reporter.</p><p>"For...me?" The reporter took the second piece of paper and looked at it. Again it was just a name and a significantly larger number. The reporter picked up her forgotten glass of champagne and drained it.</p><p>"Now this one is a little bit less but very surprising." Nodoka said. She handed the reporter a third piece of paper just as another woman, this one wasn't wearing a spider pendant, dropped off a stack of envelopes wordlessly; though looking somewhat enviously at the women at the table. "In fact this is the first time this particular client has ever bid on anybody." She said. "She's very attractive but terribly shy."</p><p>"For...me?" Repeated the reporter. "She?"</p><p>"Its the mask." Repeated Koko.</p><p>"I...this is so fast." She gasped. "I just got here."</p><p>"Yes, dear." Nodoka replied. "But as I told you, once you reached the club there'd be no turning back." She said. "You said you needed to know." Nodoka said. "But we need to know too."</p><p>"You're not expecting me to...to...sleep with someone." The reporter sputtered.</p><p>"Do you sleep?" Fumie asked Miki.</p><p>"Only if it's for a weekend." Miki replied. "Oh wait, I think she was using a, you know, a metaphor."</p><p>"Ohhh." Fumie replied. Fumie gave the reporter a searching look. "Did you really think Ms. Kuno was going to give you full access without getting some...assurances?" She asked. "You're bluff's been called." She said in low tones. "Sumire would, at the very least, speak to one of her admirers." She said. "Saatchi Kato would not." She said. "But only Sumire will get...entry."</p><p>The reporter shook her head and then a determined expression appeared on her face. "Well, they say a good reporter lives her story." She said mostly to herself. The reporter leaned back against the soft leather seat. "Full access?" She asked. An answering smile appeared on Nodoka's face and she nodded. "Everything?" The reporter persisted. "Including things of an...angelic...nature."</p><p>Nodoka laughed. "If such an...item...exists then yes, you would."</p><p>The reporter held up one of the pieces of paper and looked at it. "What do I do?" She asked. "I mean, what's happens next?"</p><p>"Next?" Nodoka replied. "Assuming we're talking about a potential...client." She said. "Then the next step would be to meet them." Nodoka said. "No one would expect you to take on a client you didn't like." Nodoka smiled. "Would you like to meet one of your admirers?" She asked coyly. In answer, the reporter handed Nodoka the piece of paper she was holding. Nodoka looked at it and nodded. "Ah, as I suspected." Nodoka handed the piece of paper to Fumie. "Fumie, please inform this client that Sumire wishes to meet and move them some place private." She said.</p><p>Fumie looked at the paper, then looked at the reporter. She smiled and, to the reporters surprise, gave her a thumbs up. "Give me fifteen minutes, Auntie." She said with a departing giggle. Fumie sped away.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Fifteen minutes almost to the second, the reporter found herself standing in front of a black curtain. The curtain surrounded one of the many private alcoves dotted around the club. Saatchi Kato took a deep breath and...Sumire parted the curtain. The alcove inside was surprisingly well lit but not overly bright."Good evening." She said in a quiet voice. "You wanted to...meet me?"</p><p>The occupant looked up and a wide though shy smile appeared on her face. She was, as Nodoka had stated, a very attractive woman in her late thirties or early forties. Her clothes were well tailored and covered an obviously trim and toned body. Her hair was equally well maintained and attractively styled. "Sumire." She breathed. "You're even more attractive close up." She said. "Please." She said in anticipation. "Sit."</p><p>Sumire sat, though not too close but not so far as to seem afraid or repelled. "Thank you." She said in quiet tones. "Ms..." She began.</p><p>"Michiko, please." The woman almost begged to Sumire's surprise. "Or Mitch." She added quickly. "My friends call me, Mitch." The last said with a touch of pleading in her voice.</p><p>"I-I wouldn't want to presume a friendship on a first meeting." Sumire replied quietly. "Maybe..." Sumire swallowed in a dry throat. "Maybe Michiko...for now?" She said.</p><p>"Please, forgive me." The woman replied. "I'm...I' don't usually do this sort of thing but when I saw you." She stopped in embaressment. "I'm ruining this, aren't I?"</p><p>To her own surprise, Sumire giggled. "I think you're doing very well, considering." She replied. "I'm a little new at this too." She confided. She swallowed again. "Is there something to drink?" She asked.</p><p>There was a small box in the middle of the table. The woman pressed a button on the box. As if she were waiting, Funie stuck her head in. "Yes, Ms. Osakawa?" She asked. "Is everything all right?" She looked at Sumire on the last. Sumire nodded.</p><p>"Some...something to drink." Michiko Osakawa replied quickly. "Champagne or, oh they have this lovely white wine here." She said. "The '03 wasn't it, Fumie?" She asked.</p><p>"I think there might be a bottle of the '03 left." Fumie replied. "And something to eat?" She asked. "Something light?"</p><p>"Sumire?" Michiko Osakawa asked.</p><p>"I'll have whatever...Mitch is having." Sumire replied.</p><p>"Wonderful." Michiko Osakawa said. The woman wiped at her eyes when Fumie left. "You...you called me Mitch." She said breathlessly.</p><p>"I..I think I'm starting to like you." Sumire replied with a rueful smile.</p><p>"Truly, Sumire?" Michiko Osakawa said in hopeful tones. Sumire looked down and nodded. Michiko patted the bench seat next to her. "Please." She all but begged again. Michiko breathed a sigh of relief when Sumire slid closer, though not quiet as close as Michiko indicated. "Why...why don't you tell me a little about yourself." Michiko suggested.</p><p>"Not a lot to tell." Sumire temporized. "I'm just...what you see." Sumire placed a hand over one of Michiko's. "Please, Mitch, let's not talk about...who I was." She said. "Here, I am just Sumire."</p><p>"Oh, Sumire." Michiko said in near anguish. "I...I shouldn't have pried." She said. "Please, forgive me."</p><p>"There's nothing to forgive, Mitch." Sumire replied. She squeezed the hand she was holding. "My past would just...get in the way." She said truthfully. At that moment a noise outside the curtain announced Fumie's return. "Enter." Sumire called. 'Enter?' She thought. 'Where did that come from?'</p><p>Fumie entered the alcove. She smiled at the closeness between Sumire and Michiko Osakawa. She placed an ice filled wine bucket on a stand. Besides the ice, the bucket contained two bottles of wine. She also placed a small tray containing tidbits on the table. Finally she placed a small piece of paper in front of Michiko Osakawa. The woman looked at it. "Can I put something for Sumire..." Michiko began.</p><p>"The first gratuity line is for me, the second is for Sumire." Fumie informed the woman. "If Sumire accepts you as...a client...then a different arrangement will be made."</p><p>Michiko Osakawa looked at Sumire for a long moment then quickly wrote on the paper. She signed it and then offered it back to Fumie. Fumie looked at the paper and smiled. "If you wish to avail yourself of any additional...services...please let me know." Fumie leaned over to Sumire. "For what she just tipped you, you'd better at the very least kiss her good night." She whispered. Fumie bowed to the two women and left the alcove making sure the curtain was tightly closed.</p><p>Michiko Osakawa made to reach for the wine bucket. "No, please." Sumire said quickly. "Let me." She picked up two fluted glasses and placed them on the table. Then she picked up one of the wine bottles and tried to carefully pour the wine but her hands shook slightly and she spilled some of the wine on the table. "I-I'm more nervous then I thought." She said quietly. Sumire quickly sopped up the spilled wine with a napkin. "You're probably already disappointed in me."</p><p>"Never." Breathed Michiko. "You...you even spill wine gracefully." She picked up one of the glasses and took a deep swallow. "I-I think I'm more nervous than I thought too." She laughed self consciously. "I've had other lovers." She said almost to herself. "But...not like you."</p><p>"We're not lovers...yet." Sumire replied. She picked up her own glass and took as deep a swallow as Michiko's. "I've had other lovers too." She said. "Not many." She added hurriedly. "But...they were all men." She admitted. "But, for some reason, they never worked out." She took another though smaller drink from her glass. "I have a confession to make." She said. "Up until now, I never thought about taking a woman for a lover." She said. "I'm still not sure." Sumire gave Michiko a slightly confused smile. "Yet the moment I met you..." She shook her head. "I don't want to lead you on, Mitch." She said. "I like you, I really do, but..." She looked down.</p><p>"Are you attracted to me?" Michiko asked quietly.</p><p>"Yes, darn it." Grumbled Sumire. She looked up when Michiko put a hand on her shoulder and found herself looking into Michiko's eyes. "I haven't said yes." She said to the emotions she read in the other woman's eyes. She sighed. "I can't believe I'm saying this but I want to say yes." She admitted. "But...I can't."</p><p>"Why not?" Michiko asked in the same quiet tones.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi Kuno and Noriko Mata walked into Ky's club. As was usual Kodachi wore a black dress and a half veil covered her eyes. Noriko wore a well tailored dark blue business suit. The two women looked around with some satisfaction. "I wonder how our...latest acquisition is doing." Kodachi said to Noriko. "I hope she isn't hiding in her suite." Noriko laughed. The two women walked over to the large private booth that Kodachi would sit in when she wasn't in her office. They found Nodoka and Koko sitting at the booth. "Good evening, Auntie. Koko." Kodachi said in greeting.</p><p>"Kodachi dear." Nodoka replied. "We were just talking about you."</p><p>Kodachi and Noriko sat down. Kodachi looked around. "Where is our...guest."</p><p>Nodoka and Koko giggled. "Our Sumire is...entertaining a client." Nodoka said. "By the way, Noriko, you owe me ten thousand yen."</p><p>"You're joking." Noriko said in delight. "Who?" She asked.</p><p>"Michiko Osakawa." Nodoka replied.</p><p>"Mitch?" Kodachi exclaimed. "Shy, little Mitch?" She laughed when Nodoka nodded. "Oh ho ho ho." She laughed. "Oh, this is too good." She wiped her eyes. "Who would have thought it."</p><p>"I did." Nodoka pointed out.</p><p>"So you did." Kodachi laughed. "So you did." She wiped the laughter induced tears away from her eyes again. "Still, I didn't expect our guest to be so...bold."</p><p>Koko and Nodoka looked at each other. "Well, we might have had a little to do with that." Admitted Nodoka sheepishly. "We sort of...gave the impression that it was...um..."</p><p>"Necessary." Koko supplied.</p><p>"Ladies." Kodachi said in reproving tones that was immediately marred by a giggle. "Oh this is too perfect."</p><p>"Fumie said that you could have cut the sexual tension with a knife." Koko added. "And that Sumire was practically in Michiko's lap."</p><p>"We must say hello." Kodachi said decisively.</p><p>"Be nice, Dachi." Noriko scolded. "We may interrupt something."</p><p>"I am being nice." Kodachi replied in innocent tones. "We're members of the same social circle, did you know that?" She said. "She had this terrible crush on this ballerina." She shook her head. "Poor thing was shattered when the ballerina rejected her advances; said she was too old for her." She sighed. "We aren't close, but I do like her." Kodachi raised a hand. As she expected Fumie was soon approaching. "Fumie." She said. "How are they?"</p><p>"Honestly." Fumie complained with a laugh. "They should have been up in Sumire's suite by now." She rolled her eyes. "Slow, the both of them."</p><p>"Just shy." Kodachi said. "See if they'd be willing to have a visitor." She said. "And then we'll see if we can't encourage them to...take the next step." A disturbance from the back of the club distracted her. "Oh second thought, maybe not." Coming toward them were Michiiko Osakawa and an embarrassed looking Sumire. Michiko had a firm hold on one of Sumire's hands and was pulling her along. Kodachi raised an eyebrow. "Is there a problem, Mitch?" She asked when they reached the table.</p><p>"Don't Mitch me, Dachi." Michiko replied. "I demand you free this poor girl from whatever cruel hold you have on her." She waved a finger under Kodachi's nose. "I know you, Kodachi Kuno, you, you, you evil creature." She spat out. Michiko turned to a stricken looking Sumire. "Don't worry, dear heart, I'll free you from her clutches."</p><p>"Evil? Clutches?" Kodachi said in surprise. "Sumire, what have you been telling...?"</p><p>"Don't you dare try to blame poor Sumire.". Michiko spat. "She refused to say anything, but, but, I know you."</p><p>"Calm yourself, Mitch." Kodachi said soothingly. "No one has anyone in clutches, evil or otherwise."</p><p>"You must." Declared Michiko. "Why else would Sumire say she must see other, other...people."</p><p>"Please, Mitch." Kodachi said. "You're making a scene." Kodachi urged the angry woman to her private booth. "Please, sit, I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding." With some urging from Kodachi and a nervous looking Sumire they got Michiko Osakawa to sit. "Now, and please, without the hystrionics, what is this all about?"</p><p>"Don't pretend." Michiko said. She turned to Sumire. "You don't have to see anyone you don't want to." She said firmly. "I'll see to that." She turned back to Kodachi. "Well?"</p><p>Kodachi blinked. "Well...what?" Kodachi said in confusion. She blinked again. "Are you requesting an exclusive contract with Sumire?"</p><p>"Of course I am." She said. She turned back to Sumire. "Don't worry, sweetheart, I'll take care of this." She turned back to Kodachi. "I will not allow you to, to work this sweet woman like some, some common trollop." She wagged a finger in Kodachi's face. "No one, I repeat no one, touches Sumire that Sumire doesn't want touching her." She declared. "Do we understand each other?" Kodachi blinked and nodded slowly. "And, and no one touches Sumire that I don't approve of first, as well."</p><p>"Now wait..." Began Kodachi.</p><p>"It's money, isn't it?' Michiko sneered. "Someone bid more than me, didn't they?" She almost screamed. "Well, well I'll double, no I'll triple whatever they bid." The woman almost vibrated with anger. "I can afford it." She said. "You know that."</p><p>"That's not..." Kodachi stopped. "I suppose something could be arranged." She said reluctantly. "Sumire is...special."</p><p>"At least we agree on that." Michiko said slightly mollified.</p><p>"But..I was hoping to introduce her to others." Kodachi pointed out in reasonable tones.</p><p>"No!" Michiko snapped. "No one else." She turned back to Sumire. "Don't you worry, baby." She said. "You just have to be firm." She turned back to Kodachi. "Four times the top bid."</p><p>"Mitch, no." Sumire exclaimed. "That's too much." She said in shock. "I'm not..."</p><p>"Yes, you are." Michiko said firmly. "I've never met anyone as, as sweet, as, as intelligent, as, as warm, as you." She turned back to Kodachi. "And you, you harpy, would turn her into a common... I can't even bring myself to say it." She snarled.</p><p>"Mitch, please." Sumiko pleaded. "I'm nothing of the sort...if, if you knew, if you knew who and what I really am, you...you'd hate me." Sumire buried her face in her arms on the table. "I'm not, not worth..."</p><p>"Yes. You. Are." Michiko said firmly. She placed an arm across Sumire's shoulders. "Are you happy now?" She snarled at Kodachi. "Look what you've done." She said. "You made her cry." She turned back to Sumire. "There, there, baby." She said. "It's okay."</p><p>"It's not okay." Wailed Sumire. "I'm a fraud, a fake." She said. "You must, you must know who I am." She sobbed. "It's the only way." She said. "Th-the only way." Sumire took a breath. "M-my re-real name is...Saat..."</p><p>"Sumire...stop." Ordered Kodachi. "Unbelievable." She said. "What about our agreement?" She asked.</p><p>"I-I changed my mind." Sumire replied with a sniff. "I'm just going to end up hurting Mitch." She said. "I-I can't do that."</p><p>Kodachi threw up her hands. "I don't believe this." She said. "You've known Mitch, what, an hour?" She said. "And you're already willing to give up everything you've ever wanted... unbelievable." She said. "Why?"</p><p>"I-I thought it would b-be fun, a..a joke." She looked sadly at Michiko. "I-I thought y-you'd be the ty-typical d-dyke." She said."I-I wa...was going t-to...why'd you have to be so nice?" She wiped at her eyes, smearing her violet makeup. "S-see? I-I'm n-not a nice person." She wiped at her eyes, smearing her makeup even more. "I-I use p-people."</p><p>"Five times the top bid." Michiko said quietly.</p><p>"Mitch!" Sumire exclaimed in horror. "Weren't you listening?"</p><p>"I think she was listening very closely." Noriko said softly.</p><p>Kodachi looked up to see that the booth was surrounded by all her 'girls' and all of them had the same concerned look on their faces'. "Fumie, please escort Sumire to her suite." She said quietly. "Koko..."</p><p>"Of course, Ms. Kuno." Koko stood. "Don't worry honey." She said to Sumire as they led her away. "We're just going to fix your make up."</p><p>"B-but, Mitch." Sumire looked over her shoulder.</p><p>"Everything will be fine." Koko said. "You'll see."</p><p>Michiko Osakawa made to get up and follow but was restrained by Kodachi's hand on her shoulder. "Let them go." Kodachi said quietly. "We have some business to conduct." She said. "Three times the top bid, I believe it was."</p><p>"I said five." Michiko replied suspiciously.</p><p>"Did you?" Kodachi said airily. "I'm sure I heard three." She waved a dismissive hand. "I think three is more reasonable anyway." She said. "She will be expected to perform her other duties." Kodachi said. "She was hired to be a hostess, after all."</p><p>"Nothing else?" Demanded Michiko.</p><p>"Not without your permission." Kodachi replied. "That was one of your requirements, I believe." Kodachi shook her head in amusement. Kodachi's expression became serious. "But I have a requirement as well." She said. "You must not try to discover her identity." She said firmly. "This is not negotiable."</p><p>"What if she decides to tell me on her own?" Michiko asked.</p><p>"Put your fingers in your ears and go 'lalalala, I can't hear you'." Noriko said with a smile.</p><p>"But..." Michiko began.</p><p>"Four weeks." Kodachi said. "Her identity must remain a secret for four weeks." Kodachi said. "If, after four weeks, Sumire still wishes to reveal her identity..." Kodachi shrugged. "My contract with Sumire ends in four weeks." Kodachi sat back and smiled. "You can wait four weeks, can't you?"</p><p>"I.." Michiko stopped. "Four weeks?"</p><p>"Four weeks." Kodachi replied. "From today." Michiko hesitated for a second then nodded. "Excellent." She said. "Now, I'm going to assume that you'll wish to take Sumire to dinner or a show from time to time." Kodachi said. Michiko nodded firmly. "Excellent." Kodachi said. "I will expect you to advise us well before hand so we can arrange for someone to cover for her." She said. "I will also expect you to advise us if Sumire will be...late coming home for the evening and, for the time being, we do expect her to be home every evening." Kodachi looked up as Miki approached with a binder. "Thank you, Miki." She said as she took the binder. She placed in on the table and opened it. She looked at it for a moment then turned it around and placed it in front of Michiko. "It's a standard service agreement." She said. "Miki was kind enough to put in your retainer fee." she tapped a section of the document. "If you would initial?"</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sumire finished washing her face. "I look a sight." She said into the mirror. "what's come over me?"</p><p>"It's the mask." Koko said. She walked over to Sumire and took her face in her hands. "There is no way I'm going be able to fix this tonight." She bemoaned. "And that mask is...going to get in the way." She shook her head. "Take it from me, honey." Koko said. "Put a mask on someone and their true personality will come out."</p><p>"You've had experience with...masks?" Sumire asked.</p><p>"That sounded more like a Saatchi Kato question." Koko said in amusement. "Put your mask back on, Sumire." She said. "On second thought, wait." Koko reached into her bag and pulled put a translucent piece of cloth. It was violet in color. "Give me a minute." Koko began folding the cloth and pulled out a needle and thread and began to quickly sew.</p><p>"Now, you're going to see magic." Fumie said. "Well, it's too late for more than a quick bath." She said. "And you're not going downstairs any more tonight." She looked Koko. "Teddy?"</p><p>"Teddy." Agreed Koko. "And the robe." She giggled. "Give Mitch something to unwrap."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Michiko Osakawa, accompanied by Kodachi and Noriko, walked out on to the third floor of the club. Sitting in the lounge were Koko and Fumie. They nodded to the three women. Kodachi turned to Michiko. She held out her hand. "Now this is the key to the room." She handed Michiko a card. "It will register with our system every time you use it." She said. "And the account you've set up will be deducted the agreed upon amount.</p><p>"What if I leave and come back the same day?" She asked.</p><p>"That would still be considerd a single visit. If you came back within twenty-four hours it would still count as a single visit." Kodachi said in assurance. "Ninety percent of the fee gets placed in Sumire's account. Minus expenses." She said. "Sumire is charged a minimal fee for room and board but once that is satisfied for the month, the full ninety percent would go directly to her." She said in explanation. "The rest belongs to the house." She said. "Of course if you wish to give Sumire an.. .allowance, well that's between the two of you."</p><p>"The kitchen is open until 4 a.m. and reopens at seven." Noriko added. "The suite has a small kitchen that is restocked twice a week." She said. "If it needs to be restocked more often than that, Sumire will be charged for the additional items."</p><p>"If there is something specific that you wish." Kodachi said. "We'll do our best to accomodate you." She said. "Within reason." She smiled. "Oh, one more thing, if perchance you bring an additional...guest into the suite."</p><p>"Dachi." Michiko said reprovingly.</p><p>"Well you did say that no one could touch Sumire without your permission, so I assumed." Kodachi replied. "An extra guest would need to be cleared by us and your account would be charged the minimum retainer fee we discussed earlier."</p><p>"I didn't mean..." Michiko replied quickly. She stopped at Kodachi's quiet chuckle. "Okay, maybe I did but only...only if Sumire..." She blushed. "You really are an evil woman, Dachi." She said. "But then, I suppose, so am I."</p><p>"I do not judge, Mitch." Kodachi replied. "But, and for what it's worth, I hope you'll both be happy.:" She smiled at Michiko. "Now, I think I've kept you from Sumire long enough." She said. "Good night and...pleasant dreams." Kodachi nodded to Koko and Fumie and the two women stood and joined Kodachi and Noriko and reentered the elevator leaving Michiko Osakawa alone in the third floor lounge.</p><p>The door to the suite opposite the elevator opened and a woman stood framed in the dimly lit doorway. She was wearing a translucent violet robe over an opaque, bright violet teddy. Instead of the mask she wore earlier, she was wearing a head covering that reached to just below her nose and had a wide slit for her eyes. "I thought I heard..." The woman began."Mitch?" She said. "Mitch!" She exclaimed happily and ran over to the older woman. "Koko said you'd be here but, but..." She stopped. "Mitch." She whispered. Sumire silently took Michiko''s hand and led her into the suite and closed the door.</p><p>The four women in the elevator looked at each other for a long moment before all four broke out laughing. "Mitch." Chuckled Kodachi. "And Sumire." She shook her head. "Who would have thought it."</p><p>"Auntie did." Fumie pointed out. "She likes her you know." She said. "Heck, I like her."</p><p>"But can we trust her?" Kodachi said seriously. "Much as I hated to do it, I have the camera running." Kodachi said. "Just in case."</p><p>"Let's just hope that won't be necessary." Noriko said. The other three women nodded in agreement.</p><p>End Chapter 1</p><p>Author's Notes: It seemed you guys liked Wedding Belles. It was, however, a side story. This is the beginning of the real Book 8. A long chapter to get everyone up to speed with where we are and some hints as to where we are going. Enjoy the ride.</p>
