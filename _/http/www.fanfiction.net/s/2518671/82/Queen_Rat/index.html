</div><p>Chapter 2</p><p>'Girls of a feather'</p><p>"Good evening, and welcome to Japan Tonight." The pretty, bespectacled brunette said to the camera. "I'm your host, Mitsui Oh." She smiled. "Well news for all you Mitch and Sumire watchers out there." She said as an image appeared on the screen behind her. The image showed two women posing arm in arm on a red carpet. One woman was a trim and attractive woman in her early forties and was wearing a low cut and form fitting black gown, the other woman was younger and dressed in an equally low cut and form fitting gown, though her gown was violet and on her face was a violet colored domino mask. "Mitch Osakawa and Sumire attended last night's gala celebrating the start of Tokyo's opera season."</p><p>The reporter swiveled her chair to face another camera. "Some of you have asked why, since we all now know that Sumire is, in reality, Saatchi Kato, we continue to refer to Saatchi as Sumire and why she continues to wear her masks." The reporter smiled widely. "I think the better question is; why do we keep referring to Sumire as Saatchi Kato."</p><p>The reporter turned to another camera. "Regardless of how she is referred to, Sumire and MItch have been the stars of this year's social season and the must have couple for any A list event." She smiled again. "And speaking of power couples..." The image behind the reporter changed to show two couples. Two athletic and handsome young men in their twenties with two extremely attractive young women on their arms, one of the women had the high cheekbones and long black hair proclaiming her Tibetan heritage, the other was virtually the living epitomy of the Japanese feminine ideal. "Pema Tenzin and Kagomi Akahito have once again been seen in the company of Chouji Tamasayo and Naoki Yamada." The reporter chuckled. "Though exactly who is dating whom has been the subject of frequent speculation and debate." She said. "One thing is certain though, Chouji Tamasayo and Naoki Yamada are probably two of the three most envied men in all of Japan."</p><p>The image changed again to show a fit middle aged man with a tall and extraordinarily beautiful woman on one arm., while a second attractive woman stood next to the couple, a collar could be seen around the neck of the second woman with an attached leash that was held by the first woman. "The most envied man in Japan, of course, being Genji Morimoto who is married to the magnificent Makoto, the woman who has topped Japan's most beautiful list two years in succession." She said. "Mr and Mrs. Morimoto along with their frequent companion, known only as Yuki, were also in attendance at last nights gala."</p><p>The reporter swiveled her chair to face another camera once again. "More society news." She said with a smile. "When we come back."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The limo stopped in front of the Kuno mansion and a woman in violet and wearing a violet domino mask stepped out of the back. As she approached the stairs leading to the front entrance of the mansion, the door opened and a number of male retainers hurried down the stairs. As the two retainers retrieved the woman in violet's belongings the door opened again and two women stepped out. The woman in violet walked up the stairs and a wide smile appeared on her face. "Makoto. Yuki." She said in pleased greeting.</p><p>"Hey Sumire." The tall and elegant Makoto replied. "Say hello, Yuki." Makkoto ordered.</p><p>"Hi, Sumire." Yuki said obediently.</p><p>Sumire rolled her eyes. "You two." She said in amusement. "Don't you ever break character?"</p><p>"Look who's talking...Sumire." Makoto replied with a laugh. "How's Mitch?" She asked.</p><p>"Mitch is fine." Sumire replied. "A little put out that she won't see me this weekend, but she understands." She said. "How's Genji?" She asked.</p><p>Makoto grinned. "Probably the same as Mitch." She said cheerfully. "It's good for them." She said. "We can't allow them to take us for granted, now can we?" Sumire and Makoto laughed. Yuki looked down.</p><p>"You don't agree, Yuki?" Sumire asked in surprise.</p><p>Yuki looked at Makoto. Makoto nodded. "Oh, I agree." She said. "It's just that I'm not supposed to talk about Genji unless Makoto says it's okay." She said with a blush.</p><p>"What'll she do if you did?" Asked Sumire. "Spank you?"</p><p>"Oh much worse." Yuki replied.</p><p>"Worse?" Sumire asked.</p><p>Yuki nodded wide eyed. "Much worse." She said. "She won't spank me."</p><p>Sumire looked at Yuki for a long moment then broke into laughter. "Oh my." She said as she wiped at her eyes. "I have a feeling this is going to be a...memorable weekend."</p><p>"It always is." Makoto said. She looped her arm through Sumire's. Then tugged on the leash with her free hand. "Come along Yuki."</p><p>The three women walked into the mansion. "Ms. Kuno's girls, and that includes you Sumire, have a suite on the second floor." Makoto said. "I hope you don't mind sharing a room." She said. "As far as I know, Suki doesn't snore." She said loudly as they entered a room.</p><p>"I heard that and no I don't." The redheaded Suki said cheerfully. "Hey Sumire."</p><p>"Hey Suki." Sumire replied. "So, we're going to be roommates this weekend, huh?" Suki nodded. "Sounds good to me." Sumire said.</p><p>"Good." Makoto said. "Well Yuki and I will let the two of you get better aquainted." She said. "Dinner is at seven. Formal dress." Makoto turned to leave then stopped. "Oh almost forgot." She said turning around. She walked over to a desk against the wall. There was a box on the desk. "This is yours, Sumire." She said. "You are expected to wear it at dinner."</p><p>"What is it?" Sumire asked. She walked over to the desk and opened it. Inside was a feathered mask. She lifted it out of the box slowly. "Oh." Sumire breathed. "I never, I mean I had hoped, but..."</p><p>"Ms. Kuno will..." Makoto stopped. "Just wear it tonight." She said. Makoto tugged on the leash. "Come along, Yuki." Makoto waved a goodbye and left the room. Yuki trotted off eagerly after her.</p><p>Sumire shook her head. "Are they always like that?" She asked.</p><p>"Always." Suki replied with a smile. Her smile changed slightly to one that was colder. "Almost always." She corrected herself. "Sometimes Makoto lets Yuki off her leash." She said. "When she does..." Suki shook her head. "Try to stay out of the way."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sumire, wearing a violet gown and wearing her feathered mask, and Suki, wearing a green gown and wearing her own feathered mask stopped at the closed doors to the dining room. Two Kuno retainers stood on either side of the double doors. Almost as one the two women reached up and caressed the spider pendants around their necks. "The first time I came here, I was scared out of my mind." Suki confided in a whisper to Sumire.</p><p>"Oh good." Sumire replied. "I thought it was just me."</p><p>Suki laughed quietly and nodded to the two retainers. They gave the two women a short but respectful bow and the two retainers opened the double doors. A burst of chatter from the room stopped as the doors opened. Sumire took a breath and the two women walked through the doors. Around the table sat nearly a dozen women all in evening gowns and all wearing feathered masks. They all rose to their feet as Sumire and Suki entered. The room fell silent.</p><p>"Who approaches the Aerie?" The woman at the head of the table said in formal tones.</p><p>"It is Toki, Inu-washi." Suki replied in the same tones. "I return to the Aerie."</p><p>"Who approaches the Aerie?" The woman called Ina-Washi asked again.</p><p>"An Angel that has fallen." Suki replied.</p><p>"Has she a name?" Inu-washi asked.</p><p>"No Inu-Washi." Suki replied. "She has flown alone and had no need for a name."</p><p>"Then how shall the flock know her?" Inu-washi asked.</p><p>"She must be named." The women and, now that Sumire looked, one girl chorused.</p><p>"Indeed." Inu-Washi said. "An Angel must have a name." She said. Inu-Washi looked down for a moment. "I name you...Mozu." She said. "Welcome Mozu." She said. "I am Inu-washi."</p><p>"Welcome Mozu." Another woman said. "I am Hayabusa."</p><p>"Welcome Mozu." Another woman said. "I am Karasu."</p><p>"Welcome Mozu." Another woman said. "I am Hitaki."</p><p>"Welcome Mozu." Another woman said. "I am Ravenu."</p><p>"Welcome Mozu." Another woman said. "I am Tobi."</p><p>"Welcome Mozu." Another woman said. This one looked at Tobi first and waited for her to nod. "I am Tsumi."</p><p>"Welcome Mozu." Another woman said."I am Misago."</p><p>"Welcome Mozu." Another woman said. "I am Zuku."</p><p>"Welcome Mozu." The young girl said. "I am..." She paused for a moment.. "I am...Hime Taka." She said a little self-consciously.</p><p>"Welcome to the Aerie, Mozu." Inu-Washi said. She waved a hand to two vacant seats. "Please take your places."</p><p>Sumire and Suki walked to the table. Sumire looked at the table and noticed a place card in front of one setting with the name Mozu written in fine calligraphy. Sumire stood in front of the seat and waited.</p><p>Inu-washi, obviously Kodachi, raised a glass. "Angels; to...the Night."</p><p>"The night." The woman chorused and drank from their glasses. The women took their seats.</p><p>Sumire leaned over to Suki. "The night?" She asked.</p><p>"Well we are ladies of the evening." Suki replied with a wide smile.</p><p>"Ouch." Sumire replied with a laugh. She looked around the table. "Tobi is obviously Makoto and Tsumi is Yuki." Began Sumire. "And Hime Taka can only be Kiko." She said. "But...the masks are pretty good."</p><p>"They should be." Ina-Washi/Kodachi said. "They cost enough." She said. "Ladies." Kodachi raised her mask. Her action was copied by the rest of the women.</p><p>Hayabusa turned out to be Noriko as Sumire suspected. Karasu was Aoi, Hitaki was Ami, Ravenu was, unsurprisingly, Rei, Misago was Miki and Zuku was Fumi. Kiko was the last to remove her mask. "My mom couldn't make it." She said with a very satisfied smile and to accompanying chuckles from the rest of the women. "But when she's with us, she's Tsuro." She informed Sumire.</p><p>"I'll try to remember that." Sumire promised.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A knock on her office door made Shampoo look up from the reports she was reading. "Yes?" She called.</p><p>The door opened and a Chinese woman stuck her head in. "Excuse me for interrupting, Simo." The woman said. "But you have a visitor." She stepped aside and an orange haired Chinese woman entered. The woman was dressed in a simple blue skirt with a white blouse and a short blue jacket over the blouse. Despite the simplicity of her outfit the woman was extraordinarily beautiful.</p><p>Shampoo smiled slightly. "Hello Ting Li." She said in Cantonese.</p><p>"Shampoo." The orange haired Ting Li replied in the same language.</p><p>Shampoo waved a hand to indicate several chairs. "Please, sit." She said. "Would you like tea?"</p><p>Ting Li raised an eyebrow. "Tea would be...appreciated." She said.</p><p>"Cho Leong." Shampoo said to her Chinese aide. "Have tea brought here for our guest." Shampoo ordered. She stood and walked over to Ting Li and bowed. "I thank you for coming." She said. "The tea will be here shortly. Please sit."</p><p>Ting Li took one of the chairs, sat and crossed her legs. "I was...surprised to get your invitation." She said.</p><p>"I apologize for not having invited you before." Shampoo replied. "It was most gracious of you to overlook my former rudeness." She bowed again before she sat.</p><p>Ting Li's eyebrow raised even higher. "I see." She replied. "I'm sure your reasons, at the time, were compelling."</p><p>"Thank you for understanding." Shampoo replied. "As you said, at the time my reasons were compelling." She bowed her head slightly. "At the time." She looked up at a knock on the door. "Enter." She said. The door opened and the Chinese aide, Cho Leong, walked in with a tray holding an elegant, hand crafted and delicately glazed tea service. The Chinese woman placed the tea service on the table between Shampoo and Ting Li, bowed and exited. Shampoo picked up the tea service and poured a cup of tea which she then raised to her lips and sipped. She waited a moment before pouring tea into a second cup and extending the cup to Ting Li.</p><p>Ting Li nodded. "An unnecessary but appreciated gesture." She said. She picked up the tea cup and sipped it. "Excellent tea." She said.</p><p>Shampoo nodded. "It serves to remind me of home." She replied. "I am too rarely home and, it appears, I may not be able to visit for some time." She said. "It may be possible that I will not be welcome even if I do go home."</p><p>"I have not heard such in any of the letters I have received from the village." Ting Li said in mild tones. "Has something...changed?"</p><p>Shampoo nodded. "Many things have changed." She replied. "For one, I bear Ranma's child."</p><p>Ting Li sat up straighter. "Interesting." She said in calm tones that belied her excitement. "If that is so, then I would think you would be more than welcome at home."</p><p>"Normally that would be true but along with Ranma's child, I have also requested and received his promise of protection." Shampoo said. She sipped her tea. "He, and his women ..." She said deliberately. "Will support my request for control of Kita."</p><p>"His women...?" Ting Li asked in questioning tones. "By that I assume you mean you have revoked any claim you might have had on Ranma?" She said. Shampoo nodded. "Yet having his child would seem to support your claim." She pointed out.</p><p>Shampoo put down her tea cup. "Normally that would also be true but I have...my reasons." She leaned forward. "I will be honest with you, Ting Li." Shampoo said. "I believe I have been...mistaken in my support of Great grandmother."</p><p>Ting Li put down her tea cup slowly and carefully. "That is...surprising news." She said. "And dangerous." She said. "Welcome but dangerous." She said. "Before I make any commitment though I..."</p><p>"Akane Tendo opened my eyes to what I was." Shampoo interrupted. "What Great Grandmother had made me." Shampoo looked down. "What I let myself become." A sour expression appeared on her face. "The child Ranma gave me, he gave me...out of pity." She said. "The way he gave me the child, he gave me...out of contempt."</p><p>Ting Li gave Shampoo a surprisingly sympathetic smile. "I think I understand." She said. "I need to think about this for a while." She said. "But my inclination is to support you."</p><p>"Thank you." Shampoo replied quietly.</p><p>"Great Grandmother isn't going to like being...replaced." Ting Li said. "Where is she, anyway?"</p><p>"Back home." Shampoo replied. "But she is expected to return by the end of this month ." She said. "I must have control before she returns." She said. "Nearly half of the Joketsuzoku here will support me." She added.</p><p>"Nearly half?" Ting Li questioned. "The odds...' Ting Li paused."The odds are pretty good,actually." She said after a moments thought. "But you'll have to maintain control afterward." She said. "You're going to need people."</p><p>"I know." Shampoo replied. "And the only person who has the...kind of people I need is not one who is likely to do me any favors." She said. Shampoo smiled slightly. "More tea?" She asked.</p><p>Ting Li nodded. She waited until Shampoo refreshed her tea and took a sip as she went through all the permutations of Shampoo's statements. 'Who has...oh.' She thought in realization. "Does Great Grandmother still seek Hika?" She asked. Shampoo nodded in response. "I suspect the assistance you seek will be dependent on Hika's health and well being."</p><p>A sour look reappeared on Shampoo's face. "No doubt." She replied. "I've already informed Akane Tendo of Great Grandmother's intentions." She said. "It may not be enough but...Ranma has surprised Great Grandmother in the past."</p><p>Ting Li sipped her tea and looked over the rim at Shampoo. Her examination didn't go unnoticed but Shampoo made no comment. 'Truly things have changed.' She thought. "I still need to think about this but I do have a suggestion." She said. Shampoo looked up. "I know you don't do humble well, Shampoo, but in this case...make an effort."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Morning found Hikaru Nakamura lying in her bed and staring at the ceiling. She hadn't slept well nor had she slept well for a long time. Not since she had woken up in China and found she was now, and apparently permanently, female. Her mind wandered back, as if often did, to those first few months in the village.</p><p>It started the first week in the village. She had been woken up by the sound of her cell door opening. The next thing she knew a man was lying on top of her and pawing at her breasts while at the same time trying to remove the loose pants she wore. Even sleepy and disoriented, Hikaru was not helpless and she stopped the attempted rape by the simple expedient of breaking her attacker's arm. After the man was removed by a couple of armed guards, both women, she was allowed to bathe, dress, eat and generally was left to her own devices for the rest of the day.</p><p>The next morning she was again wakened by someone entering her cell and again a Joketsuzoku male attempted to rape her. And again she successfully fought her attacker off. Once again two armored guards came in and removed the man and she was left alone for the remainder of the day.</p><p>The morning attacks repeated nearly every day. The only times there were no attacks were during her periods. Hikaru shivered at the memory of the first time she had a period. Nothing terrified her more, not even the morning attacks, then having a period.</p><p>Over time, Hikaru became aware of a number of things about her attackers. The first and most obvious, other than they were men, was that they were drugged. Whatever drug was being used made the normally placid Joketsuzoku males highly aroused and extremely aggressive. The next thing she realized was that each succeeding attacker was more difficult to repel then the preceding ones. Still for weeks that turned into months, Hikaru successfully defended herself and maintained her fragile grip on her masculine identity.</p><p>Then one dark morning the door opened and Hikaru knew she was lost. A tall and powerfully built man with long dark blue hair walked in and grinned at her. "Good morning, Airen." The man had said. "I hear you be good girl, save yourself for me."</p><p>"Bitch." Whimpered Hikaru as she frantically shut down the memory of that day. Hikaru was less successful shutting off the memories of the days and weeks that followed. Every day Shampoo would come into her cell. At the beginning Hikaru fought her off as long as she could but no matter what she did the result was the same. The male Shampoo would take delight in inflicting as much humiliation as was possible and would violate and ejaculate into every orifice Hikaru possessed. By the end of two weeks a defeated and dispirited Hikaru no longer had the strength or will to resist. By the end of a little more than a month, when her period did not come, when the horrible realization of what had happened came instead, something snapped within Hikaru.</p><p>It took all her remaining strength and will power to finally escape the village that very night and make her slow and torturous return to Japan. Hikaru whimpered again at the memory. She had climbed down sheer cliff faces , crossed snake infested swamps and tiger roamed forests before finally coming upon civilization. For a short while she believed she was free and even tried to start a new life but in a matter of weeks she spotted a Joketsuzoku in the village she was in. She left that evening. The next weeks were devoted to getting back to Japan and vengeance on the woman who had given her to the Joketsuzoku, Kodachi Kuno.</p><p>But vengeance did not come as expected and now, here she was, living in Kodachi's home but not, as Hikaru knew, out of any concern for her but concern for the unborn child. This had not been her first attempt to kill herself since her return, nor the second, or even the third. Finally Kodachi brought her here and under the constant watch of the Kuno retainers.</p><p>The door to the room opened. HIkaru tiredly turned her head expecting the visitor to be one of the retainers whose purpose it was to check on her, make sure she ate, went to the bathroom or to give her a sponge bath, but this time her visitors were none of these. Two people had walked into the room. Kodachi Kuno and a young girl that Hikaru vaguely remembered from the club. Both women, young and old, wore similar outfits; black leotards, covered by black shorts and a t-shirt also black.</p><p>Kodachi and the young girl walked over to the bed. "Still feeling sorry for yourself, I see." Kodachi said in cold tones. HIkaru rolled over and turned her back to Kodachi in response. "Auntie says you wish you were dead." Kodachi continued. "No more than I, Hikaru, no more than I." She snarled. "And once the baby is born you can do what you want." She said. "In the meantime...get up." She snapped. Hikaru didn't move. "Get up, I said." She repeated. "Get up or so help me I will drag you out of that bed."</p><p>Hikaru rolled over. "Why?" She asked moodily.</p><p>"You need to exercise." Kodachi said sharply.</p><p>"She needs a bath more, Mother." The young girl said.</p><p>"She can bathe after she exercises, Kiko." Kodachi replied. "Now get up." She said to Hikaru. Hikaru sighed and sat up. With a little help from Kodachi and Kiko they got Hikaru to her feet and helped her dress in a pair of loose sweats and a sweatshirt. At a little over four months pregnant, Hikaru was not really showing and the privation and stress of her time in China and her subsequent return had burned off most of her fat reserves. Fortunately Hikaru had been an exceptionally fit individual to begin with and neither she nor the developing child were in any danger but Kodachi was not taking any chances.</p><p>Kodachi and Kiko escorted Hikaru to the private training salon where nearly a dozen women were working out. Most of them stopped what they were doing when the trio entered the salon and looked at the pink haired woman curiously.</p><p>"That's Hikaru?' Sumire whispered to Suki.</p><p>"Yeah." Suki replied. "Hard to believe she was once a man, isn't it?"</p><p>"That's putting it mildly." Sumire said. "And you say it was done by...magic?"</p><p>"That's what Ms. Kuno says and if Ms. Kuno says it was magic." Suki smiled slightly. "Then it's magic." She said. "Apparently you can even get these packets of powder that'll make you change sex for a few hours or so." She added.</p><p>"Hours?" Sumire replied. "Really?" Sumire blushed. "That...that would be...um.." She stopped as Suki started laughing.</p><p>"Who'd use the packet, you or Mitch?" Suki asked in teasing tones.</p><p>"Mitch." Sumire replied in a tiny voice.</p><p>Suki laughed again. "Missing the cock, huh?" Suki asked.</p><p>"Don't you dare tell Mitch." Sumire pleaded. "It's just that...sometimes"</p><p>"Relax, Sumire." Suki said. "Your secret is safe with me." She said in reassurance. "I don't know about the packets but I do know this little shop." She grinned. "It's amazing what they can do these days."</p><p>Kodachi and Kiko spent the rest of the morning getting Hikaru to go through a series of gentle exercises. Mostly stretches and light calisthenics. To Hikaru's surprise, once her muscles warmed up, she actually began to enjoy the exercise. And just as quickly as the feeling of enjoyment appeared it vanished like a soap bubble. Hikaru fell to her knees and began to sob uncontrollably.</p><p>In moments Hikaru was surrounded by nearly a dozen women. They didn't say anything but instead let Hikaru cry herself out while standing around her protectively. The same as they would do for any woman the Fallen Angels found in a similar situation. Eventually Hikaru's sobs faded to a faint hiccuping. Hikaru felt a hand on her shoulder and she looked up teary eyed to see Kodachi looking back at her. "Here." Kodachi said in brusque tones. She gave Hikaru an opened bottle of water. "Drink some water." She said. Hikaru took the water bottle and drank. She handed the water bottle back with a sniff. "I think you've had enough for today." Kodachi said in quiet, sympathetic voice. Hikaru nodded sadly and stood.</p><p>"S-sorry." Hikaru sniffed. "I..I...I don't..."</p><p>Kodachi gave Hikaru an almost resigned smile. "It's okay, you've been through a lot." She said gently. Kodachi sighed. "I think we've all had enough for today." She announced. "Why don't we all wash up and then we can have lunch on the patio." She said. "Come along...Hika." She turned. "Noriko, Kiko, if you would."</p><p>Kiko and Noriko looked at each other for a moment. Kiko shrugged and Noriko smiled wryly. They turned and followed Kodachi and the subdued Hikaru out of the salon. Kodachi led Hikaru to a bathing area, one of several that were connected to the salon. The rest of the women went to a second larger bath.</p><p>Sumire looked behind her to watch the three women walking away before she entered the larger bathing area. Actually Sumire had entered the locker room. Each locker had a name of one of the Fallen Angels. Sunire had been delighted to find one with Mozu already on it when she had come here earlier. She quickly stripped out of her exercise outfit and wrapped herself in a towel. She grabbed her bathing supplies and hurried into the bathing room proper.</p><p>Her entrance prompted a series of catcalls from several of the other women. Sumire blushed slightly but couldn't help grinning. The feeling of acceptance was almost overpowering. "Hey Sumire, over here." Suki called. "I saved you a spot." She said. "Hurry up and wash." Suki said when Sumire sat down. "I want to get in a good long soak before lunch."</p><p>Kodachi, trailed by Kiko and Noriko, led Hikaru into a smaller bathing area. The undressed the unresisting Hikaru. Kodachi found herself feeling unexpectedly sympathetic. Over the past several years she, in the company of the Fallen Angels, had visited many of the women they had rescued from rapes. Especially those women where the rescue had been...late. Kodachi had become quite familiar with the emotional aftemath of rape and Hikaru...Hika, Kodachi corrected herself mentally, exhibited all the signs and symptoms. 'There really isn't much of Hikaru left.' She realized.</p><p>Hikaru sat on a stool in front of a tab with her head bowed and made no attempt to wash herself. Nor did she even react when Kodachi poured a bucket of warm water over her back and started washing her back. She did look up when she felt someone take her arm and wash it as well. Hikaru wearily turned her head to see the young girl, Kiko, washing her arm. Kiko returned her gaze. The look in Kiko's eyes was one that reflected the conflicting emotions in the girl. Kiko silently washed Hikaru's arms all the time giving Hikaru the same look that combined rage and disgust, even fear, all overridden by a confused concern.</p><p>It was the concern that made Hikaru react. "I-I can wa-wash myself." Hikaru said and took the towel.</p><p>"Good." Kiko replied. "Cause I wasn't washing your butt."</p><p>A thin smile appeared on Hikaru's face as she completed her own washing. Even that smile vanished quickly as she rinsed herself off. "Dr. Ono advises a short soak only." Kodachi said as they entered the hot bath. "It will do you good."</p><p>Hikaru eased herself into the hot waters of the communal bath. Noriko and Kiko followed quickly after. The three women, and Hikaru included Kiko in her thoughts, stared at Hikaru. For the first time she was able to escape from her own woes enough to return their gazes and examine their faces. She could easily make out the hatred and the contempt. That was expected even welcome. But once again it was the look of concern that was also evident that tore at Hikaru's soul. "I-I can't...can't stand it." She screamed suddenly.</p><p>Hikaru clumsily but frantically scrambled out of the tub and without bothering to dry herself or even cover herself with a towel she started to run. There did not seem to be any conscious choice of a direction, she just ran. Despite now being female, despite being pregnant and despite all the hardships and privations she had experienced in her return to Japan, Hikaru was fast. So fast she began to blur. On and on Hikaru ran, first out of the salon then up the stairs to the main floor and finally out the main door and down the steps fronting the mansion and toward the far gate...and freedom.</p><p>"Got you." Exclaimed a masculine voice and Hikaru found her head long rush suddenly checked. She tried to struggle, to break free. Hikaru screamed as she bit and clawed at the person holding her. "Desist, madam." Tatewaki exclaimed. "Hold on to her, Brother." Kodachi's voice yelled. Tatewaki turned to see his sister, Noriko Mata and Kiko Kuno all naked and running toward him and what appeared to be a dozen naked or near naked women trailing behind but approaching at a dead run. "Hurry, Sister." Tatewaki yelled back. "Migods, she fights like a demon possessed."</p><p>"Almost, Brother." Kodachi said as she approached. She raised a hand and a fine spray shot from her hand and full into Hikaru's face. The former hit man collapsed. Tatewaki scooped her into his arms. Kodachi walked over and lifted one of Hikaru's eyelids, then checked her pulse. "Brother if you'd be so kind as to call Dr. Ono." She smiled slightly. "I seem to have forgotten my phone." She waved a hand to indicate her naked body. She turned as a number of female retainers ran up with robes. One of the retainers helped Kodachi put on a robe.</p><p>"It was near on like fighting Ranma in his female form." Tatewaki grumbled.</p><p>"No doubt, Brother." Kodachi replied. One of the retainers ran up with a gurney. "Take her to her room." She said. "Brother, Ono." She directed. "I think the excitement is over for the moment, Ladies." She said to her Fallen Angels. All now wearing robes. She looked at the women who followed her unquestioningly. She smiled in approval that the two newest members of the Angels, Suki and Sumire, had, like the rest of the Angels, had obviously not stopped to dress. "Shall we adjourn for lunch?"</p><p>Sumire followed the other Angels and Ms. Kuno back to the locker room. "I can't believe Rei heard Hikaru scream." She said in an aside to Suki. The two women were beginning to form a solid friendship. They both were the newest members of the Angels as well as roommates for the weekend.</p><p>"Better than radar." Suki agreed. "Well there goes my long soak." She grumbled in amused tones. "On the other hand, I'm kind of hungry."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru woke to see Kasumi Ono looking down at her. The woman's face had the same confused concern Hikaru had been seeing in the faces of most of the women that she had seen since she returned to Japan. HIkaru tried to roll over and away from the expression on Kasumi's face but was stopped by a gentle hand on her shoulder. "You really must stop trying to hurt yourself or run away." She said quietly. "If not for your sake then for the baby's."</p><p>"I-I don't want it." Hikaru replied in pained tones. "No-no one asked m-me," She whimpered. "No-no one asked me." She said." No one asked..." Hikaru's voice faded to an unintelligible mumble. "It's not..." Hikaru began and then stopped once more.</p><p>"Fair?" Kasumi asked. "No, I suppose not." She said. Kasumi placed her hands over her own swelling belly. "It's...difficult for me to imagine not wanting a child." She said quietly. "Ono and I have wanted one since the beginning." She said. "I guess that's the difference." Kasumi added thoughtfully. "We wanted to have a baby." She said. "You didn't have that choice."</p><p>"No." Moaned Hikaru in agreement.</p><p>"Ranma was raped once." Kasumi said quietly. After a moment Hikaru rolled over and looked at Kasumi. "By...my sister." She said with a touch of shame in her voice. "They both suffered."</p><p>"Shampoo doesn't su-su-suffer." Hikaru said in an angry whisper. "Bitch."</p><p>Kasumi put a pleasant smile on her face. "I have no doubt there are many who share your opinion of Shampoo." Kasumi said. "Myself...included." Kasumi smiled at Hikaru. "It took Akane a year to tell me." Kasumi went on. "She went through a period somewhat like your own." She said. "Ranma told me she even had the knife picked out."</p><p>"Why di-didn't she?" Hikaru croaked.</p><p>"Well other than because Ranma would have stopped her." Kasumi replied. "She found a way toward...redemption." She said. "She found a reason to live, despite her self hate." She said. "She found a purpose." Kasumi looked at Hikaru. "You were not...a nice man, Hikaru." She said. "Both Kodachi and my sister Nabiki." She nodded. "Yes, Nabiki is my sister." She said to the look of realization on Hikaru's face. "They have good reason to hate...Hikaru." She said. "Yet they both find themselves torn by their feelings...for Hika."</p><p>"Feelings?" Hikaru asked in a hoarse whisper. "They h-h-hate me." She declared.</p><p>"I told you, they hate Hikaru." Kasumi disagreed. "Hika.." Kasumi smiled. "Hika cofuses them." She said. "You are everything they have pledged themselves to fight against." Kasumi took a tissue from a dispenser next to the bed and started wiping Hikaru's tear streaked face. "Rape, sexual abuse, sexual slavery all wrapped in the body of the one person they have reason to despise more than anyone on the planet." Kasumi shrugged slightly. "Hika confuses them."</p><p>"Hika con-con-confuses me too." Hikaru replied.</p><p>Kasumi smiled gently. "No doubt." She agreed. "Now, I think it's much too nice a day for anyone to be cooped indoors." She said. "Don't you?"</p><p>"Outside?" Hikaru said in nervous tones. "I-I can't..."</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll stay with you." Kasumi reassured the pink haired woman. "Now, let's get you dressed."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sumire, in her persona as Saatchi Kato, had , by virtue of being the host of one of the top rated entertainment news shows on television, been to many an elegant dinner and met and mingled with the social elite. Yet she found herself comparing the so called elite to the women she was having lunch with and, frankly, found the elite lacking.</p><p>Suki leaned over. "You've got that look on your face." She said teasingly.</p><p>"What look?" Sumire asked.</p><p>"The 'why aren't they acting like whores' look." Suki said with a grin.</p><p>Sumire blushed. "Well, um..." Sumire sighed. "Busted." She admitted. "Sort of." She amended. "I've met a lot of the so called upper class and a lot of them are...um...how do I say this politely?"</p><p>"Crude?" Suggested Kodachi from the head of the table. "How about crass?" She smiled. "No, vulger."</p><p>"I meant no disrespect, Ms. Kuno." Sumire said hurriedly.</p><p>"None taken." Kodachi said. "I happen to agree with you." Her smile became sheepish. "I must admit I was very much the same." She smiled wryly at the exclamations of disagreement from the women at the table. "Well I was." She averred. "Then I had the great good fortune of meeting and getting to know all of you." She said in tones that included everyone at the table. "I forced myself to be better because I..." Kodachi blushed slightly. "Because I didn't want to disappoint any of you."</p><p>"And that, Ms. Kuno, is why we've worked so hard." Noriko replied with a fond smile at Kodachi. "Because we didn't want to disappoint...you." Noriko turned to Sumire and was about to say something then stopped. "Oh my." The women at the table all turned to see what Noriko was looking at. Coming toward them were Kasumi and a pink haired woman in a conservative gray skirt and white blouse. The pink haired woman looked at the ground as she walked.</p><p>"I do hope we are not intruding." Kasumi said pleasantly. "But I convinced Hika that a little sunshine would do her good." She turned to the pink haired woman. "Isn't that right, Hika?"</p><p>"Yes, Kasumi." Hikaru said quietly.</p><p>Kodachi looked at the pink haired former hit man. She raised a hand and a Kuno retainer hurried over. She looked back at HIkaru. "Hika and Kasumi will be joining us for lunch." She said. The retainer nodded and hurried away. He returned within a minute with two folding chairs and two additional retainers. One carried a covered tray. Minutes later Hikaru and Kasumi were sitting at the table between Kiko on one side and Yuki on the other. When Hikaru sat down, Makoto very deliberately unhooked the leash from around Yuki's neck.</p><p>"Why'd Makoto do that?" Sumire whispered to Suki.</p><p>"So Yuki won't have to ask permission to...intervene if necessary." Suki whispered back. "Not that she would anyway but..." Sumire could hear the determination in her voice. "It's also letting everyone else know she's on alert."</p><p>Sumire nodded in understanding and turned her attention to the pink haired Hikaru. 'Kasumi called her, 'Hika;.' She thought. "And so did Ms. Kuno." Sumire paused for a moment as she realized she even thought of Kodachi as Ms. Kuno. She shook off the thought. 'Ms. Kuno called her Hika too.' Sumire nodded to herself. "I'd try the salad if I were you, Hika." She said in a conversational voice. "It's perfect on a day like this."</p><p>"I must concur with Sumire's assessment." Kodachi replied. She gave Sumire an approving look and the rest of the women returned to their conversations. Not that they relaxed but they acted as if they did, following Kodachi's lead. Kodachi served Hikaru a portion and sat back. She watched as Hikaru slowly began to eat with her head down. "I'm so glad you decided to join us." She said. "Both of you."</p><p>Kasumi laughed quietly. "And miss having lunch with the girls?" She said. "I would never forgive myself." Kasumi looked at Hikaru. "How's the salad, Hika?" She asked.</p><p>"Good." Mumbled Hikaru. "Co-could.." Hikaru stopped and moistened her lips. "Could I have something to dr-dr-drink." She asked in a quiet voice.</p><p>"Of course you can..Hika." Kodachi said. "Kiko, would you..."</p><p>"Of course, Mother." Kiko replied. She poured Hika a glass of juice, "It's pomegranate." She informed the pink haired woman. "A little tart." She said. "But very refreshing."</p><p>"Thank you." Hikaru raised the glass with a trembling hand but was able to drink without spilling. "Good." Hikaru whispered. "Co-co-could I have some m-m-more?" She asked. Kiko refilled her glass.</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane Tendo stood on the edge of the roof of the apartment building she lived in along with Ranma and Ukyo. The setting sun outlined her bowed head form. She stood like that for a long time, long enough for the sun to completely drop below the horizon. Then she slowly raised her head. Akane looked out toward the purpling horizon. "Hello, Ranma." She said. Ranma, in male form, stepped out of the shadows near the elevator housing and walked to the edge of the building and stood next to Akane.</p><p>"You okay?" He asked quietly.</p><p>"No." Akane shook her head. "Not really." She said. "I've been thinking about...Hika." Akane looked down again. "Every time I think about...her...I'm reminded of..." Akane swallowed in a dry throat. "I keep seeing your face, the way you looked at me...after I...after I..." Akane's eyes began to tear. "Raped you." She said in a whisper. Akane turned toward Ranma as she felt his arms go around her. "I'm no better than Shampoo, am I?" She said into Ranma's broad chest.</p><p>Ranma was silent for a long moment. "There was a time, just after, that I wanted to hurt you like you hurt me." He looked down at Akane. "You wanna know what changed my mind?" He asked. Akane nodded against his chest. "Everything that happened since." He said simply. "If you were really like Shampoo, you wouldn't have cared, wouldn't have tried to make it up to me." He said. "If you were really like Shampoo, you wouldn't be here." Ranma smiled. "And there's another really big difference." He said. He reached down and raised Akane's chin with a gentle hand. "I. Love. You." He said deliberately."And you love me." He added.</p><p>"I know, but.." Began Akane.</p><p>"No buts, Tomboy." Ranma interrupted. "That's all that matters." He said. "Now. How about giving me that smile?"</p><p>Akane punched Ranma on the chest. "Jerk," She said. Akane looked up and a slow smile blossomed on her face. Her smile became a squeal as Ranma leaned down and kissed her passionately.</p><p>Ukyo looked down from her perch on top of the same elevator housing the Ranma had hid next to in the shadows. She smiled triumphantly as Ranma kissed Akane. She pumped her fist and then slowly and deliberately she turned around and scanned the surrounding, 'No one, I mean no one, better interrupt them tonight.' She thought.</p><p>Ukyo had already told Pema and Kagomi to stay off the roof and give Ranma and Akane some privacy. She hadn't needed to work hard to convince them. Pema and Kagomi agreed with Ukyo about Ranma. He belonged to Akane and Akane belonged to Ranma. Unbeknownst to Ranma and Akane; Ukyo, Pema and Kagomi agreed on one other thing, they themselves belonged to Ranma and Akane. 'I wonder if this is how my other self feels?' She thought. "Hey, Uk-chan." She heard Ranma call. "Are you gonna stand up there all night?" Ukyo turned. "Depends." She replied. "How long were you planning to stay on the roof?"</p><p>Ranma and Akane laughed. "Get down here, Uk-chan." Akane called. Ukyo jumped down and landed lightly in front of Ranma and Akane. "Still watching our backs, huh Uk-chan." She said in understanding.</p><p>"Well." Ukyo replied. "You know how it is."</p><p>"Yeah." replied Akane. "I do." She said. "You would have stayed up there all night, if you had to." Akane said in tones that conveyed fond amusement. "I bet the other Uk-chan would have done the same."</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "I was just thinking about her." She admitted.</p><p>"Well, nice as the night is, it's going to get colder soon." Akane replied. "So, if you want to watch our backs, why don't we do it somewhere more comfortable." She wrapped an arm around Ukyo's waist. "How does that sound?"</p><p>"I thought you guys might want some privacy." Ukyo replied in quiet protest.</p><p>"We know baby." Akane replied. She looked at Ranma for a moment then returned her attention to Ukyo. "Woulld you like to sleep with us tonight?" She asked. Ukyo looked down and nodded. "Good." Akane said. "Face it, Uk-chan." She said. "It's going to be the three of us for a long, long time." She said. "Because if we're anything like...them, we're going to grow old together." She said. "And you know something?" Akane said. "That sounds pretty good to me."</p><p>End Chapter 2</p><p>Author's Notes. Couple of things. First a special shout out to DnDGeekGirl. I have to admit getting a SQUEEE made my day. The rest of you guys, JamesAxelrod, Jerry Unipeg and, of course, Wharpt, and all the rest, thank you. By the way Wharpt, what did I tell you about using the crystal ball? Heh. For those who haven't read it, you're going to see a number of MirrorMirror references in this story, so maybe you should read it first. Any way. Enjoy the latest chapter.</p>
