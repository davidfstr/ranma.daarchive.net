</div><p>Chapter 2</p><p>'Rei'</p><p>"Makoto." Called a melodic voice.</p><p>Makoto turned. "Rei." She exclaimed. She rushed to embrace the other woman. Rei was obviously of an age as Makoto. Though unlike Makoto she was average height, with an almost golden complexion and had long, straight black hair that reached nearly to her knees. "You look great." Makoto exclaimed.</p><p>"So do you." Rei replied in envious tones. "Gods girl, what did you do, rob a bank?" She waved at the outfit that Makoto was wearing. "That's a Donna Karen suit, isn't it?"</p><p>Makoto nodded sheepishly. "It was a gift." Makoto replied. "A," Makoto hesitated. "A friend bought it for me." She explained.</p><p>"A friend bought it for you." Rei said in disbelieving tones. "Tell me another one."</p><p>"No really." Makoto protested. She threw her hands into the air. "It would take too long to explain." Makoto said.</p><p>"I'm in no hurry." Rei said. "Come on girl, I haven't seen you in almost a year." She said in annoyance. "I though we were friends."</p><p>"We were." Makoto replied quickly. "We are." She amended just as quickly. Makoto looked at her watch. "Well I don't have to be at work for a couple hours." She said.</p><p>"Work?" Rei asked curiously.</p><p>Makoto smiled slightly. "I'm a waitress in a private club." She explained. She raised a finger. "Wait a minute." Makoto pulled a cell phone out of her purse and punched in a number. "Hey Miki." She said. "Look I ran into an old friend." She started. Makoto snorted. "Not that kind of old friend." She said. "One of my girl friends from high school." Makoto looked at Rei. "Yeah, that's what I had in mind." Makoto nodded. "I'll call you later, thanks Miki." She disconnected.</p><p>"Miki?" Rei asked.</p><p>"My roommate." Makoto explained. "Maybe you'll meet her sometime." Makoto looped her arm through Rei's. "Come on, let's get a cup of coffee or something."</p><p>"Sounds good." Rei agreed.</p><p>A short walk found Makoto and Rei sitting at a table at a local tea house. Modern times being what they were, the shop also served coffee. Makoto rested her elbows on the table as she sipped her tea. "So, how are you doing?"</p><p>"Not as good as you obviously." Rei said enviously. "I'm doing alright I guess." Rei added with a shrug. "I work in an office." She grimaced. "Gods it's so boring."</p><p>"Boyfriend?" Makoto asked.</p><p>"I wish." Rei replied emphatically. "The only guys I meet are total dorks." She said dismissively. "How about you?"</p><p>"Oh you know." Makoto replied easily. "I'm playing the field." She smiled to herself. "I see a couple guys kind of regular but nothing serious."</p><p>"A couple guys?" Rei said enviously.</p><p>"Well three actually." Makoto coughed. "But enough about me." She said.</p><p>"Oh no. You don't get off that easily" Rei retorted. "I haven't seen you in a year."</p><p>"It hasn't been a year." Protested Makoto.</p><p>"Nearly." Rei shot back. "You've changed Makoto." Rei said. "For the better." Rei laughed. "Gods you were such a stick in high school." Rei waved a hand. "Now look at you." She shook her head. "Nice clothes. Fancy jewelry." Rei narrowed her eyes. "And you claim you're a waitress." She curled her lip. "Tell me another one."</p><p>"Really, I really am a waitress." Makoto protested. "It's just that Ms. Kuno pays very well."</p><p>"Kuno?" Shrieked Rei. "Kodachi Kuno?" Rei grabbed Makoto's hand. "Kodachi Kuno as in, her boyfriend was murdered and she tracked his killer down and beat him like a dog, Kodachi Kuno?"</p><p>Makoto nodded reluctantly then clapped her hands over her ears as Rei shrieked in envious disbelief. "Well I don't know if Ms. Kuno actually beat him like a dog." Admitted Makoto when Rei stopped shrieking to catch her breath. "But knowing Ms. Kuno, even as little as I do, I can believe it." Makoto nodded. "Yeah that Kodachi Kuno."</p><p>Rei tilted her head. "And she owns a club?" Makoto nodded. "I thought the Kuno's were independantly wealthy."</p><p>"They are." Makoto confirmed. She sighed. "It was her boyfriend's club." Makoto explained. "She, well, it's hard to explain."</p><p>"What's so hard to explain?" Rei said positively. "How else would she keep his memory alive?" She sighed. "It's so romantic."</p><p>Makoto nodded and gave her own sigh. "Yeah."</p><p>"They got any openings?" Rei asked. "Come on Makoto, it's obviously better than working in an office." She said. "Be a pal Makoto." She begged. "And put in a good word for me."</p><p>"I can't Rei." Makoto replied. "I mean I could but, oh fu, oh crap." Makoto shut her eyes. "Sorry Auntie." She whispered. Makoto opened her eyes. "I really don't think it's for you Rei."</p><p>"Why not?" Rei said with a touch of heat in her voice. Her eyes narrowed in anger. "You don't think I'm good enough, do you?" Rei jumped to her feet. "And I thought we were friends, I guess I was wrong." She grabbed her purse.</p><p>"Rei wait." Makoto said desperately. "Please don't go away mad." She begged. "Look sit down, please sit down." Makoto swallowed nervously. "Look what I'm going to tell you, you can't tell anyone. Promise?"</p><p>Rei felt her anger suddenly ebb and replaced by both curiousity and concern. "You're not in any trouble are you?" Rei sat down.</p><p>"No. No nothing like that." Makoto said. "Though I could be if you tell anyone. Okay?"</p><p>Rei held her hand up and palm out. "Swear." She leaned forward. "Okay spill it." She said conspiratorally.</p><p>"Well you see." Makoto blushed. "Look it's this really, really private club." Makoto said. "And well, like they have gambling."</p><p>"Gambling?" Shrieked Rei. She clasped a hand over her mouth. "Sorry." She whispered. "Gambling?" She asked quietly.</p><p>Makoto nodded. "And um other things too."</p><p>"Drugs?" Rei asked in horrified fascination.</p><p>Makoto expression became angry. "Never." She growled. "Not in one of Ms. Kuno's clubs."</p><p>"Okay. Okay." Rei waved her arms in surrender. "No drugs, so what are the 'um other things'?" She asked. "Drinking?" Makoto nodded. "That's not so bad."</p><p>Makoto chewed her lip. "Well, um, there's, there's." Makoto broke off.</p><p>"More 'um other things'?" Rei asked. "Well it's not gambling, you already said that, and it's not drinking and it's definitely not drugs, that doesn't leave much." Rei's eyes widened suddenly. "You don't mean?" She asked. Makoto nodded. "You?" Makoto nodded again. Rei sat back abruptly. "You." She stated. "The girl who didn't kiss a boy until she was seventeen, you?"</p><p>"I wasn't that bad." Protested Makoto.</p><p>"Tell that to someone who doesn't know you." Rei snorted. "I thought you'd never lose your virginity and now you are sitting there and trying to tell me that you, you." Rei stopped. "How many men," Rei licked her lips. "How many men have you, you know."</p><p>"Just the three." Makoto replied. "I'm only allowed the three." Makoto said with a touch of confusion in her voice. "I don't know why but Ms. Kuno insists." She smiled to herself. "Not that I'm complaining you understand."</p><p>"How?" Rei licked her lips again. "How much," Rei broke off. "They pay you?"</p><p>"Well not exactly." Makoto replied. "Ms. Kuno pays me very generously and I make a lot in tips." She explained. "My regulars give me some spending money too." She smiled. "Not that they ever let me spend my own money when I'm with them." She sighed. "Especially Genji." She said. "Don't tell anyone but he's my favorite." Makoto suddenly became aware that Rei was staring at her open mouthed. "What?"</p><p>Rei's mouth worked soundlessly for a moment. Rei swallowed. "You're not kidding, are you?" She whispered in awe. "You're really a, a, a."</p><p>Makoto leaned forward. "I think the word you're looking for; is whore." Makoto shrugged. "I guess."</p><p>"You guess?" Rei asked in fascination. "What's that mean?" She leaned forward. "You're fucking these guys aren't you?" Rei tilted her head at the wince that appeared on Makoto's face. "What?"</p><p>"Please, not that word, okay?" Makoto begged. "Anything but that word."</p><p>"Well what do you call it then?" Rei asked.</p><p>Makoto didn't say anything for a moment then she smiled. "Entertaining," She said. Makoto looked Rei in the eyes. "Now do you see why I can't recommend you for a job?"</p><p>Rei sat back in her chair and looked at Makoto. She took in the clothes, the jewelry. But mostly she took in Makoto. The gawky and shy girl she knew from high school was gone and replaced with the assured, and damn it, sexy, woman in front of her. Rei licked her lips. "Please." She begged.</p><p>"Rei!" Exclaimed Makoto.</p><p>"Come on Makoto." Rei pleaded. "Look at you then look at me." She said. "I want nice clothes too, you know." She grabbed Makoto's hand. "Please Makoto. Just an introduction."</p><p>Makoto sighed deeply. "Wait a minute." Makoto fished her cell phone out of her purse again and punched in a number. "Auntie?" She said when the call was answered. "It's Makoto." She said hesitantly. "Um Auntie I hope you wont be mad at me but I um ran into a friend and um well I told her," She broke off. "Sorry Auntie." She said. "She's a good friend from high school." She looked Rei. "Yeah, she's pretty." Makoto nodded. "Black hair." She said. "No really, black, the girls used to call her Raven."</p><p>"Makoto." Scolded Rei. "You don't have to tell her that."</p><p>"Yeah that was Rei." Makoto ignored Rei's outburst. She cupped the phone. "Auntie says you have a nice voice." Makoto put the phone back to her ear. "Well we could use another waitress." Makoto said. She looked at Rei again. "Well not with what she's wearing."</p><p>"What's wrong with what I'm wearing?" Demanded Rei.</p><p>Makoto cupped the phone again. "It won't do. Ms. Kuno has standards." She explained. she unconvered the phone again. "Sorry Auntie." She nodded again. "Yeah, I suppose." Makoto nodded again. "Thank you Auntie, love you." Makoto disconnected. She looked at Rei. "Okay you got your introduction. At least to Auntie."</p><p>"Great." Rei said happily. "Thanks Makoto." Rei sucked her lips in for a moment. "Um, who's Auntie?"</p><p>"Auntie is the woman you're going to have to impress." Makoto explained. "Hang on again." She punched another number into the phone. "Miki?" She said. "I have to go to the club early. I'm introducing Rei, that's my friend, to Auntie." She looked around. "I'm at the Red Umbrella Tea Shop on Blossom Street." She said. "You sure? Okay, we'll wait for you here." She said. "Thanks Miki." She disconnected again. "Well Miki will pick us up here." She waggled a finger at Rei. "Don't you dare embarrass me." She warned.</p><p>It was barely fifteen minutes later when Miki pulled up in her sportscar. She honked the horn and Makoto, followed by Rei, hurried out. Makoto got into the front seat and Rei got into the rear. "Nice car." Gushed Rei.</p><p>"Thanks." Miki replied. "So you're an old friend of Makoto's huh?" Miki glanced in the rear view mirror. "Well you're pretty enough."</p><p>"Thanks." Rei replied. "I hope you don't mind me asking but are you, I mean, do you, I mean at the club." She babbled. "Like Makoto?"</p><p>"Well no one is like Makoto." Miki said cheerfully. "And not as much as I used to." Miki replied. "I think I dance more than entertain." She laughed. "But yeah." Miki looked in the rearview mirror again. "You gotta boyfriend?"</p><p>"No." Grumped Rei. "Like I was telling Makoto, most of the guys I meet are lame."</p><p>"You said dorks." Makoto pointed out.</p><p>"That too." Agreed Rei.</p><p>"How about a girlfriend?" Miki asked. "And I don't mean like Makoto."</p><p>"If I don't meet a guy soon that may be a possibility." Rei said in tones of frustration. Her lips curled wryly when Miki laughed. "Go ahead laugh." She grumped. "It's brutal out there."</p><p>Miki laughed again. "I think I like her Makoto." Miki said.</p><p>The car pulled into the parking lot behind the club. Miki parked the car and the three women got out. "Now remember Rei." Makoto cautioned. "Auntie is very old fashioned. Don't curse or act rude."</p><p>"But be yourself." Miki added.</p><p>"And smile." Makoto said. They entered the club. "Hey Abe." Makoto greeted the burly bouncer.</p><p>"Hi Makoto." Abe rumbled in pleased greeting. "Hi Miki." He nodded at Rei. "Who's this?"</p><p>"Abe this is Rei." Makoto said in introduction. "She's an old friend of mine." She said. "Auntie is expecting her."</p><p>Abe gave Rei an evaluatiing look. "Not bad." He said finally. "Mrs. Saotome is in the office." He said to Makoto. Abe opened the door and waved them in. "Hope you get the job Rei."</p><p>"T-thanks." Rei stammered and hurried into the club after Makoto and Miki. "He's huge." She said to Makoto. "And kinda cute." She added a moment later.</p><p>"You thiink Abe is cute?" Miki shook her head. "Oh well, it takes all kinds." Miki led Makoto and Rei to the office and knocked on the door. Miki opened the door. "Good afternoon Auntie." She and Makoto chorused.</p><p>"Good afternoon." Nodoka replied from behind the  stood and walked over. "And this must be Rei." Nodoka wore her usual elegant kimono, this one in peach tones.</p><p>Rei nodded. "Yes Ma'am."</p><p>"My." Nodoka commented. "Your hair really is black." She said in appreciation. "And wonderfully long." She started circling Rei. "Stand up straighter." She commanded. "Better." She said when Rei complied. "How many lovers have you had?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Ma'am?" Rei asked in confusion.</p><p>"It was a simple question." Nodoka replied cooly. "How many lovers have you had?"</p><p>Rei counted under her breath. "Does one time count?' She asked after a moment. Nodoka nodded. Rei mumbled a little more. "Um, six?"</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "Well that's not too bad." She said calmly. "If you eliminated the one times, how many?"</p><p>"Two Ma'am." Rei replied quickly. 'Gods this woman is scary.' She thought.</p><p>"Any special talents?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Talents Ma'am?" Rei squinted her eyes in confusion.</p><p>"Don't squint." Nodoka scolded. "Talents." She continued. "Can you play an instrument, for example."</p><p>"No Ma'am." Rei replied.</p><p>"Rei's being modest Auntie." Makoto interjected. "Rei used to sing in the school choir." She said. "And if I remember correctly, didn't you sing in a band?"</p><p>"Wasn't much of a band." Muttered Rei. "Yeah, okay I can sing a little."</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "Interesting." She murmured. "And are you currently employed?"</p><p>"Yes Ma'am." Rei replied. "I'm an office lady." She said.</p><p>"Well if you're employed why would you consider working here?" Nodoka asked sharply. "An office is a perfect place to find a husband."</p><p>"Yuck." Rei said. "A boyfriend sure, but a husband?" She shook her head. "Uh uh, no way. Not yet." She gave Nodoka a pleading look. "Please ma'am." She waved toward Makoto. "Makoto was the plain one and look at her." She sighed enviously. "I would kill to look half as good."</p><p>"Rei." Protested Makoto. "I'm nothing special."</p><p>"I see we still have to work on your self esteem Makoto dear." Nodoka said gently. She returned her attention to Rei. "I assume today was a day off?" Rei nodded. "And how much notice will you have to give?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"A week, I think." Rei replied. "Does, does that mean you're willing to give me a chance?"</p><p>Nodoka sighed. "Yes, I suppose so." She said. "On one condition."</p><p>"Anything." Rei replied.</p><p>"Sing for us." Nodoka said.</p><p>"What? Here?" Rei said in disbelief.</p><p>"No not here." Nodoka walked to the door and opened it. "Follow me." Without looking to see if she was followed she walked out of the office. She pointed. "There."</p><p>Rei followed Nodoka's finger to the stage where a small number of women were practicing a dance routine. "You're kidding?" She said.</p><p>"No." Nodoka replied. "I am not." She said. "We have an excellent Karaoke system. I'm sure you can find something you know."</p><p>"But." Rei began. "I sang mostly American Jazz and Soul music." She explained. "So if you're expecting something traditional."</p><p>"Oh come on Rei." Makoto urged. "Show Auntie what you can do."</p><p>"But." Rei tried again.</p><p>"Please." Begged Makoto.</p><p>Rei blew out a breath. "Oh alright." She said reluctantly. She walked over to the Karaoke machine and started flipping through the song lists. Here eyebrows raised when she realized Nodoka was understating the system. 'Damn the song list is huge.' She thought. "Ah." She said aloud.</p><p>Nodoka walked over to the stage and clapped her hands briskly. "Girls." She said. "I hate to intrude on your rehearsal but we have someone who applying for a position and she claims to be a singer." She waved her hand to indicate Rei. "Are you ready?" She asked Rei.</p><p>Rei nodded and pressed a selection on the machine and then walked quickly to the center of the now vacated stage. A slow sultry beat began to play and Rei started to sway to the rhythm. With the first notes the club quieted down and Rei was singing 'Smooth Operator' by Sade. Her voice started off hesitantly but soon strengthened as she lost herself in the song. Rei finished to the sound of applause.</p><p>"More." Shouted some of the girls from the side of the stage.</p><p>"Well, I don't know." Rei began. She looked at Nodoka who nodded. "Well okay." A cheer went up as the girls and some early patrons seated themselves around the stage.</p><p>It was halfway through the impromptu concert that Kodachi and Noriko entered the club. Kodachi raised an eyebrow as she listened as the young woman on the stage sing song after song. "She's not bad." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Not bad." Snorted Noriko. "We're going to have people coming here just to hear her sing." Noriko asserted. "What do you want to bet there is going to be a bidding war over her too?"</p><p>Kodachi nodded with a pleased smile on her face. "Excellent." She said. Kodachi indicated the stage. "Shall we?" Noriko nodded. The two women walked over to the stage just as Rei finished another song. Kodachi and Noriko clapped their hands. "Excellent." Kodachi said. "Most excellent." She turned. "I see you found us another gem Auntie."</p><p>"Actually Makoto found her." Nodoka said. She waved Rei over. "Kodachi may I present Rei," Nodoka paused. "Oh dear."</p><p>"Rei Ayami." Rei said hurriedly. "An honor to meet you Ms. Kuno." She bowed.</p><p>"A pleasure." She indicated Noriko. "May I introduce my companion, Noriko Mata."</p><p>"Ms. Mata." Rei bowed again.</p><p>"It appears that Rei and Makoto were school mates." Nodoka supplied. She looked at Makoto. "It is fortunate that Miss Ayami is acceptable." She said to Makoto. "Else I would still be disappointed with you."</p><p>"Sorry Auntie." Makoto said contritely.</p><p>"You're forgiven but you must be more discrete in the future dear." Nodoka said imperiously.</p><p>"I'll try Auntie." Makoto promised.</p><p>"So Rei." Kodachi said. "Am I to assume you wish to join our little family?"</p><p>Rei nodded vigorously. "Yes Ms. Kuno." She said. "Very much so."</p><p>"Wonderful." Kodachi said.</p><p>"There is a minor problem." Nodoka interrupted. "Miss Ayami is already employed and it would be; you did say a week?"</p><p>"Yes Ma'am." Rei replied.</p><p>"Call me Auntie." Nodoka said offhandedly. "That is a pity." She said. "Though the fact that you wish to give notice does speak highly of you."</p><p>"Thank you Ma'am." Rei replied in pleased tones. "I mean Auntie." She said hurriedly at a warning look from Nodoka.</p><p>"Do you have a business card?" Noriko asked. Rei nodded. "Give it to me." Rei fished in her purse and pulled out a business card. She handed it to Noriko. Noriko looked at it and a slow smile came to her face. "I don't think it will be a problem." She said and showed the card to Kodachi.</p><p>Kodachi chuckled. "No I don't suppose it will be."</p><p>Noriko pulled her cell phone out of her purse and punched in a number. "Hello?" She said. "Oh Kimi, it's Noriko." She smiled. "Fine, fine." She said. Noriko looked at the business card as she spoke. "Kimi, could you do me a favor?" She asked. "We have a Miss Rei Ayami here and it appears she works for IQ Holdings." Noriko nodded. "Well she's applying for a position here at the club and we'd like her to start tonight."</p><p>"Tonight?" Squeaked Rei. "Sorry." She said hurriedly at the looks that were shot her way.</p><p>"Yes that was Miss Ayami." Noriko chuckled. "Actually as a singer." Noriko said into the phone. "Thanks Kimi." She said. "The three of you are still coming for dinner this weekend right?" She asked. "Good. Later Kimi." Noriko disconnected. "Okay problem solved." She said to Rei. "As of this moment, you are officially, though very temporarilly, unemployed."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Rei swallowed nervously from the sidelines watching the dancers on the stage. The last several hours had been a whirlwind of activity. Once her employment was finalized she was run through a gauntlet of preparations. A costume for her debut was found and fitted. It was black, tight fitting and low cut.<p>Then she was exposed to the wizardry of Koko Kobiashi her face was made up and her hair was put in two long ponytails on either side of her head giving the impression of wings. All the while Nodoka Saotome kept a running commentary of what was expected of her as one of Kodachi's girls. 'Not at all what I thought.' Rei thought.</p><p>"Remember Rei." Nodoka had said. "You do not accept any offers. If a gentlemen is interested, you are to direct him to either myself or Koko." She instructed. "You will leave all the negotiations to us." She said. "Nor will you entertain until after your second show. Is that understood."</p><p>"I think so Auntie." Rei had replied.</p><p>"Good." Nodoka had replied. "Don't look like that, we have only your best interests in mind."</p><p>Rei took a sip of water. She smiled as Makto ran up. "Ready Rei?" Makoto asked. "I just know you're going to be a hit."</p><p>"Yeah, if I don't throw up." Rei grumped. "I didn't expect to sing."</p><p>Makoto giggled. "What did you expect?" She asked. "Lounging around in a teddy all night?" Makoto shook her head though she continued to smile. "Maybe in some common brothel but not here." She said. "Here we entertain." She leaned forward. "The girls have a pool going."</p><p>"Pool?" Rei asked.</p><p>Makoto nodded. "To see how high the bidding will be for you."</p><p>"Bidding?" Squeaked Rei.</p><p>"Um hum." Makoto grinned. "I picked a hundred and fifty thousand yen." She said.</p><p>"A hundred and fifty thousand yen?" Rei's eyes widened.</p><p>"Oh not for an hour." Makoto added. "That's for a weekend." Makoto gave Rei a quick hug. "We're all pulling for you Rei." She said. "Now you go out there and show'em what you got."</p><p>"Rei." Came Nodoka's voice. Rei and Makoto turned around. "Good evening Auntie." Rei and Makoto chorused.</p><p>"Good evening ladies." Nodoka smiled as she approached. "My you look lovely Rei."</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Rei said.</p><p>"Nervous?" Nodoka asked. Rei nodded. "You'll be fine dear." Nodoka said. "Jusr remember to smile."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Rei put a smile on her face.</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka said in approval. "Just like that." The was the sound of applause and Nodoka looked at the stage. "Ah, the girls finished their first set." She turned back to Rei. "Now wait for your introduction."</p><p>To Rei's surprise Nodoka walked to the stage. "Good evening everyone." Nodoka said to the audience. "We have a special treat tonight. A new girl has joined us." She smiled at the sudden murmur from the crowd. "Now all our girls are special as you know and all have their talents." Nodoka continued. "Our new girl is no exception." She waved a hand and Rei walked hesitantly to the stage. "Now since this is her first night here she's a little nervous as you might expect. Ladies and gentlemen please give a warm welcome to the newest member of our little family. Raven." There was a smattering of polite applause.</p><p>"Raven?" Rei whispered out of the side of her mouth. "Oh I am so going to get Makoto back for that."</p><p>"I don't see why dear." Nodoka whispered back. "The name suits you." Nodoka gave Rei's shoulders a squeeze. "You'll be fine dear." Nodoka leaned a little closer. "Break a leg." She whispered. Nodoka released Raven and left the stage.</p><p>Rei swallowed nervously then raised the microphone to her mouth. "H-hi." She stammered. She looked around and noticed all the working girls were facing the stage. Makoto was at the foot of the stage and she flashed Rei a quick thumbs up. "Go Raven." Shouted Makoto. Her shout was taken up by the rest of the working girls. Rei giggled. "Oh what the heck." She said. "Hit it." Nodoka pressed a button on the Karaoke machine and the opening strains of 'As time goes by' flooded the room. Rei began to sing.</p><p>Kodachi reached under her veil and wiped away a sudden tear. Noriko leaned over and squeezed Kodachi's shoulder. "Fitting, don't you think Noriko?" Kodachi said huskily. Kodachi closed her eyes behind the veil and let the sadly sentimental song wash over her. Her hand went to the bullet between her breasts.</p><p>"Yeah." Noriko replied and wiped a lone tear that ran down her own face.</p><p>Kodachi opened her eyes. "She does have a lovely voice." She said after awhile. Kodachi applauded along with the rest of the audience as the song ended. "It appears our clients appreciated it as much as I." She said approvingly.</p><p>Rei sang five more songs to complete her set. Rei beamed as the applause washed over her. She bowed over and over before skipping off the stage and over to the waiting and smiling Nodoka and Makoto. "That was great." Makoto squealed. She jumped up and down excitedly. "I can't wait for the second set."</p><p>"I must agree." Nodoka nodded at Rei in approval. "Very pleasant dear." Nodoka looked up as Fumie hurried over. "Yes?"</p><p>"Ms. Kuno would like to see you and Rei at her booth." Fumie said. Fumie smiled at Rei. "I think Ms. Kuno was pleased."</p><p>"Of course she was pleased." Nodoka said. She took Rei's arm. "Come along dear." She said. "Oh Makoto."</p><p>"Yes Auntie?" Makoto replied.</p><p>"Please walk around and, discretely mind you, see what our clients thought." Nodoka directed. "You know what I'm looking for."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." With a short bow Makoto wandered off.</p><p>Nodoka led Rei toward Kodachi's private booth. Kodachi and Noriko looked up at their approach. Rei bowed nervously. Kodachi inclined her head regally. "Very well done Miss Ayami." Kodachi said approvingly.</p><p>"Thank you Ms. Kuno." Rei said in relief.</p><p>"Please join us." Kodachi indicated the padded bench. "Fumie, please get Ms. Ayami a glass." Fumie placed a glass quickly on the table. Kodachi smiled wryly behind her veil. To Rei's surprise Kodachi poured the wine herself. "A gift from a friend.." She said indicating the wine. "I think you'll enjoy it."</p><p>Rei smiled hesitantly and took a sip of the wine. Her eyes opened wide. "What is this?" She took another sip. "It's wonderful."</p><p>"A cabernet." Kodachi replied. "You mean you've never had wine before?"</p><p>"I've had wine but it never tasted like this." Rei took another sip. "I used to think I hated wine." Rei said. "This is good."</p><p>Kodachi smiled. "Indeed." Kodachi leaned over. "Your problem Miss Ayami is that you never had good wine before." She said in amusement. Kodachi leaned back in her seat. "Fortunately that is something that can be remedied." She tapped her lips with a manicured finger. "I was most pleased." Kodachi said. "But something was missing."</p><p>"Missing Ms. Kuno?" Rei asked in concern.</p><p>"Live music." Noriko said firmly.</p><p>"Of course." Kodachi agreed. "That's exactly what was missng."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Makoto walked around the club. Stopping at tables to chat with the clientelle. Most of the regulars knew of Makoto's lack of availability though that didn't stop some of them from making a request of two. Mokoto just smiled and turned the conversation back to Rei. A half hour or so later she walked over to Kodachi's private booth.<p>Nodoka looked up at Makoto's approach and raised an eyebrow. "Well?"</p><p>Makoto placed a number of envelopes in front of Nodoka. "Eight bids Auntie." She looked around . "Where's Rei?"</p><p>"She's in my office resting." Kodachi replied. "Eight bids and that's after one set." Kodachi said approvingly. "Excellent."</p><p>Nodoka picked up one of the envelopes and opened it. "Well let's see what our Miss Ayami is worth." Nodoka extracted a slip of paper and looked at it. "He has to be joking." She said. Nodoka opened a second envelope and then a third. "Ah now this is more like it." She placed that envelope off to a side. "Makoto dear."</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Makoto said eagerly.</p><p>"Do you know where the camera is?" Nodoka asked. She opened another envelope and looked at the bid. She placed it in one of the piles.</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Makota nodded.</p><p>"Please get it." Nodoka opened another envelope as Makoto ran off. By the time Nodoka had gone through all the envelopes Makoto had returned.</p><p>"I have the camera Auntie." Makoto said proudly.</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka handed Makoto three envelopes. "Please take pictures of the clients who made these bids and let them know they are being considered." She smiled indulgently at Makoto's happy giggle.</p><p>"And give them a drink on the house." Kodachi said.</p><p>"Of course Ms. Kuno. I'll be right back Auntie" Makoto smiled happily and ran off. 'Three acceptable bids.' Makoto throught. 'Oh Rei is going to be popular.' Makoto checked the markings on the envelopes that indicated the table it came from. She approached the first table. A man in his early middle age was sitting there nursing a drink. He looked up inquiringly as Makoto approached. 'Not bad looking.' Makoto judged. "Good evening sir." She greeted the man.</p><p>"Good evening." The man returned.</p><p>Makoto raised a hand and one of the waitresses ran up. "Ms. Kuno is buying this gentleman a drink." She said to the waitress. The waitress nodded and ran off. "The house would also like to inform you that your bid is being seriously considered." The man's face lit up with a smile. "You seem like a nice enough guy." Makoto commented.</p><p>"Thank you." He said.</p><p>Makoto nodded. "You're welcome." She raised the camera. "Smile." Makoto took the man's picture and ran off. She stopped at the remaining two tables where a similar conversation ensued. Makoto took each man's picture and hurried back to Kodachi's private table. "I got the pictures Auntie."</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka took the camera. "Rei's second set is soon. Why don't you check up on her?"</p><p>"Thanks Auntie." Makoto ran off to the office and knocked on the door. She opened the door and walked in. "Hey Rei." She greeted her friend. "How are you doing?"</p><p>"Nervous as hell." Rei admitted. She was sitting on a chair in a conversation nook. "It's all happened so fast."</p><p>"That's how it goes here." Makoto shrugged slightly. "At least that's how it happened for me too." She said. "One moment me and mom are fighting and the next moment," Makoto blushed. "The next moment I felt like the most desired woman on the planet."</p><p>Rei chewed her lips nervously. "Makoto?" She said in a tiny voice. "I don't know if I can go through with it."</p><p>Makoto walked over quickly and put a comforting arm across Rei's shoulders. "Then don't." Makoto said firmly. "Ms. Kuno will keep you around as a singer." She said. "You heard them, they loved you."</p><p>"She won't be upset?" Rei asked in surprise.</p><p>"Of couse not." Makoto blushed. "Though it really isn't that bad." Makoto said sheepishly. "Especially with Genji." Makoto sighed. "He treats me like a princess." She sighed again. "I was nervous too but, look it's really hard to explain but when I was in high school none of the guys would talk to me, let alone ask me out." She said in tones of an old hurt. "Too tall, remember?"</p><p>Rei nodded. "Yeah." She replied. "I remember."</p><p>"Not here." Makoto almost preened. "Here, I'm the most exclusive girl in Ms. Kuno's stable." She declared. "I don't know why Ms. Kuno doesn't want me to work like Fumie or Ami but I'm not complaining." She laughed. "And you know what's even funnier?"</p><p>"No what?" Rei asked.</p><p>"The more exclusive she makes me the more they want me." Makoto laughed. "Heck Rei, saying no will probably just make your fee that much higher."</p><p>Rei looked down. Her long hair hung down like a curtain. "Do you really think someone would pay one hundred fifty thousand yen?" She asked quietly. "For me?"</p><p>"Rei the people who come in here are either rich or powerful and usually both." She said. "They can afford that much easy."</p><p>Rei looked up through the curtain of her hair. "Yeah?</p><p>"Yeah." Affirmed Makoto. "According to Miki, before Ms. Kuno, this place wasn't that different then any gambling den. Mostly legit games, overpriced drinks and the girls hustling as best they could." Makoto looked at the ceiling. "Ms. Kuno changed all that." Makoto said. "It started with the dancers." She said. "With Noriko in fact but Miki said that the bidding started with her."</p><p>"They bid on Miki?" Rei asked.</p><p>Makoto nodded. "They still do." She said. "Miki says she makes more that way." She giggled. "Most of the dancers do the same." She shook her head at Rei. "Rei, I know Miki gets more than fifty thousand yen for an hour of her time and she's just in the chorus line." She giggled again. "Now Ami and Aoi on the other hand work at what they call a volume discount." Rei joined Makoto in giggling. "And Fumie only works when it's busy or when she needs some extra money." They stopped at a knock on the door. The door opened and Nodoka walked in. Makoto jumped to her feet. Rei followed a moment later.</p><p>"Ah ladies." Nodoka said cheerfully. "All rested Rei?" She asked.</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Rei replied.</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka said approvingly. "Now before you go out, Kodachi and I were wondering if you wouldn't be too hurt if we put off making a decision on your first date for a day or two?"</p><p>Rei's eyes widened. "You want me to wait?"</p><p>"If it isn't too inconvenient." Nodoka said innocently. "But we feel that we might have underestimated your appeal." She said. "For that we apologize." Nodoka smiled hopefully. "You do understand, don't you?"</p><p>"No. No. It's fine." Rei said quickly.</p><p>"Wonderful." Nodoka beamed. "Now let me look at you." Nodoka examined Rei's face and gown. "You look fine." Nodoka said after her inspection. "Though I think we'll ask Koko to give you a more exotic style next time." She said. "Oh and Makoto, would you mind taking Rei shopping tomorrow?"</p><p>"Shopping?" Rei's eyes widened.</p><p>"All right." Makoto cheered. "Oh. Oh. I've got to talk to Miki." Makoto was almost jumping up and down with excitement. "We'll go together. Miki knows all the best places to shop."</p><p>"Shopping?" Rei asked again.</p><p>"Well of course." Nodoka said. "You don't expect to wear the same thing every night?" She said. "Of course not." Nodoka declared. "We'll discuss this afterwards." Nodoka said firmly. "Right now, you have some songs to sing."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma, naked and in male form, stared pensively into his closet. "What to wear?" He said to himself. "What to wear?"<p>The door to the bedroom and Akane and Ukyo walked in. "Ranma. Ukyo and I were talking and," Akane stopped and put her hands on her hips. "Why aren't you dressed?" She said in annoyance."The limo will be here soon."</p><p>"I can't decide what to wear, Tomboy." Ranma complained. He pulled out a light gray suit. "The suit?" He said. Ranma reached back into the closet. "Or the black dress?"</p><p>Akane rolled her eyes. Then she giggled. "Only you would have such problems." She said. "Okay, we'll help you decide." She turned her head. "Ukyo. Steak or sushi?"</p><p>"Steak." Ukyo said promptly.</p><p>"Steak." Akane said casting her vote. "You're wearing the suit." Akane said firmly.</p><p>Ranma gave the black dress a last look before reluctantly putting it back in the closet."Oh well." He said. "I've been feeling kinda guyish anyway." He said. Ranma took the suit to the bed and returned to the vanity to put on his makeup before putting on the suit. He was just finishing buttoning his shirt when the doorbell rang.</p><p>"That's the limo." Akane said from the vanity. She made a last minute correction to her makeup before standing. Ukyo got off the bed where she had been lounging watching Ranma dress. The two women grabbed their purses. A few minutes later Ranma was in the back seat of the limo with Akane and Ukyo flanking him. "Sure nice of Kodachi to send the limo." Akane commented. She leaned comfortably against Ranma with her legs curled up under her.</p><p>"Yeah." Agreed Ukyo from her position on Ranma's left. "I could get used to it." The ride to Kodachi's club took nearly an hour. Ukyo leaned against Ranma as she watched the scenary go by. She could feel Ranma move a little to make Akane more comfortable. Any feeling of being left out was mitigated by feeling Akane's hand touch lightly on her shoulder.</p><p>"You know we could have roof hopped and been here in half the time." Ukyo commented as the car pulled into the parking lot.</p><p>"And chance getting my clothes dirty?" Ranma replied. "No way."</p><p>Ukyo laughed. "Yeah, what was I thinking?" She conceded. "Just that there used to be a time when you didn't care."</p><p>"Like hell he didn't." Akane disagreed. "Baby always cared about his looks." She said. "No matter what sex he was at the time." She looped her arm through Ranma's. Akane waited until Ukyo took his other arm. "Of course back then he didn't spend a hundred thousand yen on a suit." She smiled triumphantly at Ranma's bark of laughter. "Neither did I for that matter." Akane sighed happily. "Life is good." She said. "I got a good man and the best girl friend a girl could have." She looked across Ranma and caught Ukyo's eyes. "And I mean that."</p><p>Ukyo smiled. "I know you do sugar." She replied. "And I mean that too."</p><p>"Good." Akane said. She nodded. "Life is good." She repeated.</p><p>They entered the club greeting Abe as they did. "Everything calm tonight Abe?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Abe snorted. "It was until just now." He said in friendly complaint. "Try not to break too much okay?"</p><p>"Me?" Ranma laughed. "You wrong me, my friend." He placed his hands over his heart. "You hurt me right here." He said melodramatically. He grinned as Abe laughed. "We'll do our best Abe. Promise."</p><p>Abe laughed again then gave Ukyo and then Akane a measuring and appreciative look. "You guys gonna promise to be good too?' He asked.</p><p>"Nope." Ukyo replied. Akane nodded in agreement. "Oh don't worry Abe." She said. "At least we cause a lot less damage than Ran-chan." Ukyo pointed out.</p><p>Abe raised a hand with his thumb and forefinger held slightly apart. "About this much difference." He said knowingly. "I don't know Ranma." Abe said. "They look like trouble."</p><p>"Oh they are." Ranma said in cheerful agreement. "That's what I love about'em."</p><p>"Our reputation has preceded us." Akane sighed. She sauntered closer to Abe. "Why you being mean to us baby?" Akane said in her Aoi voice. "You not getting enough loving?"</p><p>Abe laughed. "Here?'" He said in disbelief. He opened the door. "Have fun guys." He smiled widely as Akane and Ukyo both gave him an affectionate kiss. "Don't even think it Ranma." Abe said as Ranma passed by.</p><p>Ranma laughed and followed Akane and Ukyo into the club. They were immediately met by a familiar face. "Hey Noriko." Ranma greeted the brunette. "Good to see ya." Ranma claimed a kiss from Noriko that left her breathless. He released her at the familiar chorus of 'slut' from Akane and Ukyo.</p><p>"Better not let Auntie hear you talk like that." Noriko said. She grinned as Akane and Ukyo both paled. A thoughtful expression appeared on Noriko's face. 'I hope Auntie decides to be 'good' tonight.' She thought in amused annoyance. 'I don't think they know about Auntie's 'boys'. Noriko quickly put a smile back on her face. "Ms. Kuno is expecting you." She said.</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo exchanged amused looks. "Ms. Kuno?" Akane looped her arm through Noriko's, "After all the two have been through together?" She asked innocently. "I would think you would at least be calling her Kodachi by now." She said. "Tell me, have you heard from Kinnikun lately?"</p><p>"Trying to embarrass a professional whore is useless, Akane." Noriko replied cooly. Then she smiled in resignation. "Actually I even call her Dachi every so often." She said. "When we're alone." She threw up a hand. "Or with Kinnikun." She smiled fondly. "Kinnikun flew in last weekend if you must know." She said. "It was a good weekend."</p><p>"I bet." Akane giggled. "Not bad for an old guy."</p><p>"I wont ask how or what you know." Noriko said. "And he's not old. He's mature." She looked over her shoulder at Ranma then turned her attention back to Akane. "Maybe you'll find out what I mean one day." Noriko said sweetly.</p><p>"Ouch." Ranma said in complaint. "You better quit while I'm ahead Tomboy." Ranma said with a smile. "So." He asked after a moment's thought. "Is it serious?"</p><p>Noriko shook her head. "No and it couldn't be." She said. "There's always going to be Ky." A bittersweet smile appeared on Noriko's face. "In a way, I'm glad." She said. "Kinnikun is a real man and Kodachi needs a man but," She waved a hand indicating the club. "There's always going to be Ky." She finished. Ranma nodded in understanding. His nods echoed by Akane and Ukyo.</p><p>They reached the door to Kodachi's office. Noriko knocked and opened the door. "You have visitors Ms. Kuno." she waved Ranma, Akane and Ukyo into the office then followed them in and closed the door.</p><p>Kodachi, with her veil lifted off her face, rose to greet her guests. "It's so good to see the three of you." Kodachi said after giving and receiving embraces and kisses from her guests. "I'm so glad you accepted my invitation."</p><p>"Hey and miss one of your discoveries?" Ukyo exclaimed. "Uh Uh." She said."Besides we like coming here." She said. "Especially when we're not in the mood for the Black Orchid." Ukyo accepted a drink from Noriko. "Thanks." She snorted. "And especially when Konatsu is mad at Ryoga." She exclaimed. "Like now."</p><p>"Trouble in paradise?" Kodachi purred in amusement.</p><p>"Ryoga's being selfish." Ranma stated firmly. "If I were Konatsu I'd kick the jerk out." Ranma said. "And he is a jerk." He said with conviction. Akane and Ukyo nodded knowingly in agreement. "Giving a little head isn't going to kill him you know."</p><p>"Is that what the problem is?' Kodachi asked archly. "How droll." She tapped her lips. "I wish Konatsu had told me, I could have done something before now." Kodachi's voice wound down as she spoke and ended in a whisper. Kodachi wiped at her eyes for a moment then lowered her veil. "Excuse me." she said quietly. Noriko hurried over and knelt down next to Kodachi and took her hand. Kodachi sighed then nodded. "Yes of course." She said in a quiet voice. "Well I can do something now." She added in a stronger voice.</p><p>"Count us in." Ranma said with an evil grin.</p><p>"Right!" Echoed Akane and Ukyo.</p><p>"Oh ho ho ho." Kodachi laughed. Though it was a slightly pained laugh it was still a laugh of true amusement. "You'd think he would have learned his lesson last time." She said.</p><p>"Some people need more than one hard lesson." Ranma said. "And Pigboy has a really thick head." Ranma downed the remains of his drink. "Well this girl talk is great and all that." Ranma said.</p><p>Noriko laughed. "Girl talk?"</p><p>"What?" Asked Ranma in deep yet feminine tones. "Don't I qualify?"</p><p>Noriko opened her mouth and closed it again. "That was so weird." She said. "You sounded just like Ranko for a second."</p><p>"What's weird about it?" Ranma replied in the same tones. "I am Ranko." He pointed out.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Fumie looked around the club to see if anyone needed anything. She noticed the three people standing at the Karaoke machine. From the gestures she guessed they were trying to select a song. "I better tell them no one's supposed to sing until after Rei's set." She said to herself. Her eyes widened when she realized who she was looking at. Fumie looked around and signaled frantically to another waitress. The woman ran over. "Ami." Fumie said. "That's U.S.A." She hissed.<p>"U.S.A?" Ami looked at the Karaoke. She immediately recognized, even without their trademark wigs, the two women flanking the tall muscular man. Ami had been to the Kabuki and had seen them perform , the man was unknown to her but she had heard the rumors. "That's her?" She asked. "I mean him, her, whatever. That's Usagi?"</p><p>Fumie who had met Ranma in both forms nodded. "That's her." She affirmed. "Come on." She grabbed Ami's hand and pulled her along as she hurried over to the trio. "Please, please, please tell us U.S.A. is going to perform." Fumie started pleading even before they reached the Karaoke machine.</p><p>"Well I'm not quite dressed for it." Ranma waved his hand down his body. "So to speak." Ranma chuckled. "And I didn't bring a change of clothes."</p><p>"Please." Chorused Fumie and Ami again."I'm sure we have something you could wear." Ami added.</p><p>"Tempting." Ranma admitted. He appeared to consider the idea then he shook his head. "Nah, like I told the girls, I'm feeling kinda guyish tonight." He said. "Still I hate disappointing my fans." He said musingly.</p><p>"Oh stop teasing them Ran-chan." Ukyo scolded cheerfully. She turned to Akane. "He is such an attention whore." She said.</p><p>"No kidding." Akane agreed. "He was just waiting to be asked." She said to Fumie and Ami. She smiled as the two girls laughed. "Well if you're sure it's all right." She said. "I guess we could do one or two songs." She added. "Just to warm the crowd up."</p><p>"Yes!" Shrieked Fumie and Ami. Fumie raised her hands. "Don't sing yet." She said excitedly. "Wait, I've got to tell Ms. Kuno." Fumie raced off. Ami watched Fumie run off then turned her attention to Ranma.</p><p>"I've seen that look before." Ranma said toAmi. "Yeah, it's true." He said. "But I ain't showing you tonight." Ranma smiled at Ami.</p><p>"I don't think she minds." Ukyo said in an amused aside to Akane. "Look on the bright side, at least he's not likely to do any lap dances tonight."</p><p>"I wouldn't bet on it." Akane shot back. Akane giggled. "If there's a switch hitter here tonight, baby will find him." She gave Ranma a fond look. "He may be a slut, but he's our slut."</p><p>Ukyo glanced over to Akane. 'Ours, huh?' She thought. 'She means it too.' Ukyo moved closer to Akane and put an arm around the dark haired girl's waist. 'I think I mean it too."' She smiled at Akane. "Yeah." She said aloud. "I hope you have one of those packets left." She whispered to Akane. "Just in case." She smiled as Akane laughed and then nodded. "Oh good." She looked up at the sound of someone approaching. "Here comes Fumie. Judging by the grin I guess we got the green light."</p><p>Fumie ran up. "Ms. Kuno said yes." She said excitedly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Rei sat nervously in her chair as Koko fussed over her makeup. Makoto sat on the vanity and watched the transformation to her friend in awe. "You look just like a song bird." Makoto said. Indeed Koko had used bolder colors on Rei and brushed on in a way to give the impression of feathers. Her long black hair cascaded wing like from either side of her head and Koko had added ribbons of diffferent bright colors. The colors Koko had picked were echoed by the irridescent colors of Rei's long and tight fitting dress.<p>"Indeed." Nodoka said from her seat in front of the vanity. She walked over and examined Rei's face critically. Finally she nodded. "Excellent Koko, you've outdone yourself."</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Koko smiled. Koko's smile fell at the sound of music that came through the closed door. As one the four women turned their heads toward the door. "I thought there wasn't supposed to be any Karaoke until after Rei sang." Koko said in annoyance.</p><p>"There wasn't." Nodoka frowned. She walked to the door and opened it. She poked her head out and looked toward the stage. After a moment Nodoka beckoned with her hand.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>An angry bluesy guitar riff filled the club and all eyes turned to the stage. Three people, a man and two women, were standing on the stage. The man in front of the microphone and the two women stood just behind. All three moved in time to the rhythm. The man grabbed the microphone in both hands. Ranma began to sing in an almost gutteral growl.<p style="text-align:center;">On the day I was born,</p><p style="text-align:center;">All the nurses gathered round</p><p style="text-align:center;">And gazed in wonder</p><p style="text-align:center;">At the joy they had found</p><p style="text-align:center;">Then the head nurse spoke up</p><p style="text-align:center;">And said; leave that one alone</p><p style="text-align:center;">She could tell at a glance</p><p style="text-align:center;">I was bad to the bone.</p><p>Ranma sang George Thorogood's 'Bad to the Bone' with a voice full of growling, swagger. Akane and Ukyo's dancing reflected the swagger. The expressions on their faces affirmed Ranma's right to swagger.</p><p style="text-align:center;">B-b-b-b-bad</p><p style="text-align:center;">B-b-b-b-bad</p><p>Ranma finished the second chorus then released the microphone and stepped back during the guitar solo and began to dance. His motions matched those of Akane and Ukyo.</p><p>The waitresses and working girls stopped in their tracks and stared hungrily at the tall man whose motions, while the same of the two women, were different, more masculine. Very masculine. And yet there was a quality to the man's movements that seemed to evoke the blatant sexuality of a stripper. Their eyes seemed inexorably drawn to the man's hips as they moved in a way that men's hips were never expected to move. The women slowly began to gravitate to the stage. When the man began to sing again there was a collective sigh .</p><p style="text-align:center;">B-b-b-b-bad</p><p style="text-align:center;">B-b-b-b-bad</p><p>Again the man stepped back from the microphone and joined the two women dancing. The working girls, veterans of many an encounter and who thought they had seen it all, found themselves squealing like teenagers.</p><p>Four women clustered in a doorway and watched the show. Rei had found herself moving to the beat and mouthing the words along with the man singing. "He's good." She said in admiration and her nervousness forgotten. "Do you know who he is?"</p><p>"That, Rei dear," Nodoka said proudly. "Is my son."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Rei basked in the applause that rose deafeningly as she finished her last song. Makoto ran up to the stage with a bouquet in her hand and gave it to Rei. "You were great." Makoto enthused.<p>"thanks Makoto." Rei replied giddily. She gave a final bow to the patrons then skipped off the stage. Rei felt glorious. Her set had gone well and the audience already warmed up, first by U.S.A. and then the dancers that followed, was wildly appreciative. Rei nearly ran back on stage to take another bow but was stopped as Nodoka approached clapping her hands.</p><p>"wonderful Rei dear." Nodoka said warmly.</p><p>"Thank you Auntie." Rei replied almost breathlessly.</p><p>Nodoka looped her arm through Rei's. "You are most welcome." She said fondly. "Now come along, Kodachi wishes to speak to you." Nodoka turned her head. "Oh Makoto dear, I'm glad I found you." She said. "It appears you have a visitor."</p><p>"Visitor?" Makoto asked. Her eyes widened. "Please tell me it's Genji." She said hopefully.</p><p>"Well it just so happens it is." Nodoka began. She chuckled as Makoto hurried away. "That girl." She said in amusement. Nodoka sighed. "I fear one day she's just going to run off with him."</p><p>Rei, who had seen pictures of Genji, looked over her shoulder curiously. "Do you really think so?' She asked. "I mean he's good looking and all that but isn't he a little old for her?"</p><p>"Nonsense." Nodoka said firmly. "Age is just a number." She said. "besides there are few men her age who could afford her."</p><p>Rei's expression sobered at the reminder of Mokoto's profession. 'And maybe mine as well.' She thought. "Auntie?"</p><p>"Yes dear?" Nodoka answered.</p><p>"H-has any decision been made? About me I mean." She asked hesitantly. "I don't want to appear ungrateful but," Rei took a breath. "Maybe not so old?"</p><p>Nodoka laughed. "Don't worry Rei dear, we've taken that into consideration." She patted Rei's hand. "And to answer your question, we have narrowed the choices down to a very select few." Nodoka stopped and turned to Rei. "But I want you to remember, you may refuse any or all of them if you wish."</p><p>"Won't Ms. Kuno be angry?" Rei asked. "I mean, she's spent so much on me already." She stopped as Nodoka raised her hand.</p><p>"No dear." Nodoka said. "Kodachi will never be angry at you." She said. "As for the money, pittance in comparison to what you've already given in return." Nodoka started walking again. "No put any such concerns out of your mind." Nodoka led Rei to Kodachi's booth. "Well here she is." She announced.</p><p>To Rei's surprise Kodachi stood and walked over to Rei and, to Rei's further surprise, embraced her warmly. Rei hesitantly returned the embrace. A minute later Rei found herself seated at the booth with a glass of cabernet in front of her. She took an appreciative sip."Ooh, I think this one is even better than the other one." She said.</p><p>Kodachi nodded. "I agree." She said. "You have a remarkably discriminating palate for someone who once believed she didn't like wine." Kodachi said in approval. Kodachi sat back. "now." She said. Kodachi handed Rei a stack of folders. "I want you to take these home and look through them."</p><p>Rei took the folders and opened one of them. Inside was a picture of a man, not bad looking in Rei's opinion, and what appeared to be a biography and, as Rei looked closer, a financial statement. Rei whistled in awe at the numbers listed. She looked at Kodachi. "What is this?" She asked in confusion.</p><p>"Your suitors." Kodachi replied simply. "If any are acceptable you will let me know." She said. "So we can arrange an introduction."</p><p>"Introduction?" Rei asked.</p><p>"Well yes." Kodachi replied emphatically. "You can only tell so much from a picture. I wouldn't want you to be with someone you didn't like."</p><p>Rei counted the folders. There were an even dozen. "Twelve men wanted me?" She asked in awe.</p><p>"Actually the number was closer to fifty." Kodachi replied ofhandedly. "These are just the ones we thought would be most suitable."</p><p>"Fifty?" Squeaked Rei. Rei looked at the folders again. "This is not what I expected." She said almost to herself. Rei laughed sheepishly. "Makoto was right, I was expecting to lounge around in a teddy." Rei looked at the folders again. She began to giggle. "This is better."</p><p>Author's Notes: Well I have a Usagi, an Ami, a Makoto and, now, a Rei. No this isn't going to be a Sailor Moon crossover but the names were chosen as both a homage and to evoke certain Sailor Moonish aspects.</p>
