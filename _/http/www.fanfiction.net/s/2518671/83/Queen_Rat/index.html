</div><p>Chapter 3</p><p>'Temporary Help'</p><p>Shampoo took a deep breath before exiting the limo. She looked at the club front in front of her. 'Humble, Shampoo, be humble.' She told herself. Since it was early evening the line outside the outer club was short, not that it mattered as the doorman waved her through immediately. Shampoo walked to the back of the outer club and to the massive bouncer sitting on a stool in front of a door. Shampoo may not have been a fan of Sumo but she recognized power and skill when she saw it. She gave the huge man a bow. "Shampoo to see Black Widow." She said carefully.</p><p>"You are expected, Ms. Shampoo." Botan Abe replied. He stood and held the door to the private club open and waved Shampoo through. Before she took more than a couple steps three women dressed as geisha approached.</p><p>"Ah, Shampoo." The middle Geisha said in greeting. She turned to the two trailing Geisha. "Ume, Sakura, please be dears and watch the club for me." She said. The two Geisha, middle aged women now that Shampoo was able to take a closer look, giggled. "Yes, Miss Nodoka." They chorused. The bowed to Shampoo and walked away with their heads together and continued giggling. Nodoka watched them go. "Don't let their...demeanor, fool you." Nodoka said. "Their husbands have become quite wealthy listening to their advice." She said in an aside. "Kodachi was... surprised to hear from you." She said. "I, on the other hand, welcome the opportunity to discuss a few matters."</p><p>"Hika." Shampoo said in understanding.</p><p>"Among other things, yes." Nodoka said. "Regardless of whatever...understanding you come to with Kodachi, you and I will have...words."</p><p>Shampoo looked at the Geisha in surprise. "Who you?" She demanded. Shampoo looked at the Geisha more closely. Her head jerked back ln recognition. "You Ranma mother." She exclaimed.</p><p>"Indeed." Nodoka replied. "And you're carrying my grandchild." Nodoka nodded. "Oh yes, dear." Nodoka said cooly. "I know everything." She smiled. Her smile resembled the serene smile that would appear on Ranma's face when he was deep into the Soul of Ice. "Including the price you paid for it." She said. "Akane was gleefully...descriptive." She said. "Was it worth it?" She asked.</p><p>Shampoo closed her eyes for a second and took a breath. She opened her eyes and let the breath out slowly. "I...I not sure yet." She replied.</p><p>"Good." Nodoka replied. "Ah, we're here." She escorted Shampoo to a door. Nodoka knocked. The door opened to reveal Noriko Mata. She was dressed in a well tailored, dark colored, business suit. She gave Shampoo a cold, appraising look before she stepped back and bowed Shampoo and Nodoka into the office.</p><p>Shampoo walked into the office to find Kodachi sitting at her desk. Though she was still called the Black Widow, in recent months she had begun to forgo wearing her half-veil. Not today. Today she wore the half-veil and was dressed completely in black. Sitting on the desk next to Kodachi was Kiko Kuno, Kodachi's adopted daughter. Shampoo find herself the object of interest of four unfriendly pairs of eyes. Shampoo bore the scrutiny for several long moments before she bowed in half. "Thank you for seeing me, Kodachi Kuno." She said.</p><p>"Shampoo." Kodachi replied. She leaned back in her chair and waited.</p><p>Shampoo nodded as if to herself. She took a breath. "It was Great Grandmother idea to smuggle guns, drugs and women into Japan." She said. "It Great Grandmother idea to use Hikaru." She licked her lips. "Shampoo not deny she thought it good idea." She said. "Shampoo not deny much blame belong her." Her announcement was greeted with silence. "It Shampoo plan, replace Great Grandmother." She said. "Undo what been done."</p><p>"And that concerns me...how?" Kodachi asked coldly.</p><p>Shampoo licked her again dry lips. "Shampoo have made agreement with Ranma." She said. "He promise help but Ranma help not enough." She said. "Shampoo need..." Shampoo waved a hand as she searched for the words. Finally she pointed to Noriko. "Shampoo need women like her." She said. "Smart women able do more than lie on back."</p><p>"Again, how does that concern me?" Kodachi asked again though her tones showed a touch of interest.</p><p>"All smartest women belong Kodachi Kuno." Shampoo replied. "Women you train, Shampoo want borrow until she find own." Shampoo looked down. "In exchange, Shampoo..." Shampoo sighed. "Shampoo agree to whatever Kodachi Kuno ask."</p><p>"No preconditions at all?" Kodachi asked in surprise. Shampoo shook her head in acceptance. "Interesting." Kodachi said quietly. "And Hika and the child?"</p><p>"Shampoo not care what happen to Hika." Shampoo replied honestly. "Child..." Shampoo paused. "Child innocent of what between me and Hika." She said. "But think it better if I no raise." She rubbed her stomach lightly with one hand. "Shampoo hope you understand."</p><p>"I do." Kodachi agreed. "And I agree but you will pay support...for both of them." She said in no nonsense tones. "Noriko..." She began.</p><p>"I will have a service contract drawn up immediately, Ms. Kuno." Noriko promised.</p><p>Shampoo gave Kodachi an envious look. "That what Shampoo mean." She said. "You no have to say anything, your women know what to do."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Cologne, Elder and Matriarch of the Joketsuzoku, one of the oldest and most powerful Joketzukoku of her's and any other generation,was not pleased. Her trip to the village had not turned out as she had expected. The Council of Elders expressed little interest in persuing a more aggressive strategy in Japan, claiming that the policies enforced by Nabiki Kuno, while it produced less income than Cologne's was more reliable and less...confrontational. "They've gotten soft." She muttered contemptuously under her breath. To add insult to injury, the voyage home had been uncomfortable and, now, no one was waiting to greet her.</p><p>This last indignity worried her. 'Where are they?" She said to herself. Cologne was about to call when a limousine turned the corner and approached. It stopped and two Chinese women stepped out. "It's about time." She snapped.</p><p>"We apologize for the delay, Elder." One of the women replied as the other woman began loading Cologne's luggage into the back of the limo. "An unfortunate mix up in the schedule." She said smoothly. "Shampoo was most upset."</p><p>Cologne grunted as she eased herself into the back seat of the limo. "Upset." She said peevishly. "I'll show her upset." She said. "This was a deliberate insult." She said. "It's time and passed time that I reminded her who is in charge." She said under her breath. "Hika's child?" She asked aloud.</p><p>"According to Dr. Ono, the child is developing normally." The first woman reported. "Dr. Ono thinks it's going to be a big baby."</p><p>Cologne nodded. "Good. Good." She replied. "And Hika herself?" She asked. "Has she been located?"</p><p>"Not, as yet, Elder." The Joketsuzoku replied. "Though the Black Widow assures us that Hika and the developing child are being well taken care of." She said. "She even sends medical reports." The warrior paused for a second. "The Ice Queen has...suggested that she will take any attempts to retrieve Hika before the child is born as..unacceptable."</p><p>"Unacceptable?" Sputtered Cologne. "Who does she think she is?" She growled. "Lax, that's the problem, I have become lax and everyone forgets their place, most especially my ungrateful great grand daughter." She muttered imprecations under her breath. "Ono." She said suddenly. "He obviously knows where Hika resides, all we need do is follow him." She said.</p><p>"We tried that, Elder." The first woman said. "If I may be so bold, Elder, but it's very possible you had your attention on the wrong martial artist." She said. "Dr, Ono..." She moistened her lips. "Dr. Ono is...not what he seems." She said. "He was able to successfully evade our three best trackers." She said. She smiled sourly. "They were...impressed."</p><p>"Bah, he's just a man." Cologne disagreed in contempt. "Talented but still a man." She said. "It's Ranma and Hika that we want." She said. "Their blood combined with Joketsuzoku blood, through Shampoo..." Her voice took on tones of anticipation. "Their children will be...exceptional."</p><p>Cologne spent the remainder of the trip to the Purple Cat Lounge in ruminitive silence. Her mood, already foul, dropped further as no one came out to greet her. "Insults upon insults." She grumbled. "Where is everyone?" She fumed. Even as she pogoed on her cane toward the entrance of the club, the door opened and Shampoo, flanked by two of her strongest aides, came out to greet her. "There you are." Cologne said peevishly. She nodded toward the two aides. "Expecting...difficulties?" She asked as they walked to Shampoo's office.</p><p>"A wise warrior plans for difficulties even on friendly ground." Shampoo replied in somber tones. "Wouldn't you agree, great grandmother?" She asked as they entered the office.</p><p>"When a warrior needs bodyguards on friendly ground, then the ground is no longer friendly." Cologne replied tartly. "I begin to tire of your attitude, Shampoo." She snapped. "You become more insubordinate by the day."</p><p>"Insubordinate, Great Grandmother?" Shampoo asked calmly. "Have I not done all that you've asked?" She said. "Do I not carry Ranma's child?" She smiled coldly. "Did I not give a child to Hika as you demanded?" She said. "So how am I insubordinate?"</p><p>"Do not play with me, Shampoo." Cologne snapped.</p><p>"Or what, great grandmother?" Shampoo replied. She nodded toward the two women that flanked her. "I'm in good hands."</p><p>Cologne snorted. "Do you truly think your bodyguards can stop me?" She asked in amusement.</p><p>"You misunderstand their purpose." Shampoo replied. She raised her chin and made a quick hand movement. Before Cologne could blink the two women had large knives in their hands. They gazed at Cologne with deadly calm. "Their purpose is not to stop you but to delay you." Shampoo said. "Just long enough to..." The door to the office opened and a pretty Japanese woman stuck her head into the room.</p><p>"Excuse me, Ms. Shampoo." The Japanese woman said. "But is all well?"</p><p>"Everything fine, Miki." Shampoo replied. "Oh, Miki, have you met Great Grandmother?"</p><p>"Not as yet, Ms. Shampoo." Miki replied. "A pleasure to meet you, Great grandmother." She said. "Ms. Kuno speaks of you...often." Miki gave the two bodyguards an inquiring look. "Ah, excuse me a moment." She closed the door. In less than a minute the door opened again. A tall and extremely attractive woman walked in, she held a leash in one hand, on the other end of the leash was a shorter though almost as attractive a woman. Miki also reentered the office. "If you need any assistance, Makoto and Yuki are quite capable." Miki said.</p><p>"Thank you, Miki." Shampoo replied.</p><p>"You're quite welcome, Ms. Shampoo." Miki replied. "Oh, by the way, Makoto and Yuki took care of that last remaining problem we discussed earlier."</p><p>"Genji helped too." Makoto piped up proudly.</p><p>"Shampoo, who are these people?" Cologne demanded angrily.</p><p>"Temporary help." Shampoo said in somewhat regretful tones. "The Black Widow loan her best until I find replacements." She said.</p><p>"Replacements?" Cologne asked slowly. "You didn't." She demanded as realization set in. "The Council will not stand..."</p><p>"Shampoo think Council no do anything." Shampoo interrupted. "If Council truly back Great grandmother then why they leave Ting Li alone?" She asked. "If Council truly back Great Grandmother then why you need go back so often?" She shook her head. "No, Council not do anything." She said.</p><p>"Insufferable." Exclaimed Cologne. "I've had just about enough..."</p><p>"And Shampoo have more than enough." Shampoo snapped. "Shampoo listen to Great Grandmother and for what?" She glared at the old woman. "To be Great Grandmoher whore?" She asked angrily. "That all you think Shampoo good for." She said. "You say bed Ranma, you say bed Hikaru." She said. "And Shampoo do." She raised her chin. "What else you call that?" Shampoo slowly sat upright. "Well Shampoo say just because she whore it not mean she stupid."</p><p>"Amen, Sister." Miki said under her breath. She looked at the tableau in front of her. Shampoo's two bodyguards were barely holding themselves back. A quick glance showed that Makoto had unhooked Yuki from the leash and Makoto herself had slipped on her gloves. One wrong move would result in an explosion. 'What would Noriko do?' She asked herself.</p><p>Kimi Ota's briefing made it clear how dangerous Cologne was but instead of being afraid, Miki was proud that Noriko selected her to lead the team and was determined not to fail her. "Excuse me, Ms. Shampoo.' Miki interjected. "Great Grandmother has had a long trip and I'm sure she's tired." She said calmly. "If she were rested she would, undoubtedly, realize that no...reorganization could occur without the Ice Queen's approval."</p><p>Shampoo sat back in her chair and a rueful smile appeared on her face. "Yes, of course." She said. "Shampoo should have said that first." She nodded.</p><p>"You've been very busy, Ms. Shampoo." Miki replied calmly. "If Great Grandmother wishes, I could arrange for a meeting with Lady Kuno." She suggested. "It may take a day or two but I'm certain she'd be willing to speak to you." She said. "In the meantime, may I suggest that any further discussion be deferred until Great Grandmother has had a chance to rest."</p><p>"At least some of your...temporary help have manners." Cologne mumbled peevishly and somewhat defeatedly. Being Joketsuzoku she could not help but be impressed with competent women and the women in the room, especially the Japanese ones, seemed extremely competent. "I think a nap would be...welcome." She said.</p><p>"Wonderful." Miki said cheerfully. She turned to Shampoo. "If you'll excuse me, Ms. Shampoo." She said. "I'll escort Great Grandmother to her room."</p><p>Shampoo nodded. "Thank you, Miki." She said. Shampoo watched as Miki escorted Cologne from her office. When the door closed she turned to Makoto and Yuki. "Great Grandmother could kill you easy."</p><p>Surprisingly Yuki smiled broadly. "Maybe, maybe not." She replied. "Ms. Kuno didn't pick us just for our looks, you know." She said. "Right, Makoto?"</p><p>Makoto smiled slightly and fanned her fingers. As if by magic a half dozen knives appeared in each hand. Even from where she sat, Shampoo could see that several of the knives appeared coated in some substance. "Poison?" Shampoo asked.</p><p>"Narcotic. One of Ms. Kuno's." Makoto replied. "Strong enough to stop an elephant." She flexed her hands and the knives vanished. "Well I think we've had enough excitement for today." She announced. Makoto turned to Yuki. "And someone is being just a little too smug." She announced. Makoto reattached the leash around Yuki's neck. "I think you need to be punished." She said. Yuki shivered in anticipation. "And since Genji is here." She smiled. "Come along, Yuki." Makoto tugged on the leash and Yuki trotted along eagerly behind Makoto as they left the office.</p><p>Shampoo shook her head as the two women left the office. She made a hand movement and her personal bodyguards relaxed as well. "Thank you." She said in Cantonese. "Please have Miki see me when she returns." She asked. She waited until her bodyguards left the room, then Shampoo leaned back in her chair. "I wonder if Ms. Kuno would be willing to part with those three?" She asked herself. Shampoo sighed. "Probably not." She answered herself. "I wouldn't."</p><p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru Nakamura sat in an overstuffed chair in the room she had been given. A week ago she had been moved out of the temporary infirmary and into this room. It was a small room on the top floor of the mansion. It gave her a sense of privacy that she craved. At nearly five months pregnant, Hikaru was just beginning to show a baby bump. She had nearly panicked when she discovered the bump but, to her dismay, her feeling of panic was overshadowed by an unexpected feeling of accomplishment. 'I really am becoming...Hika.' She thought moodily. There was a knock on her bedroom door. Hikaru glanced at the clock on an end table next to the bed. "I'm not expecting anyone." She said to herself. "Yes?" She said in a louder voice.</p><p>"It's Kiko, Hika." Kiko Kuno's voice came through the door. "I was...I was wondering if you'd like some company."</p><p>HIkaru looked at the door in surprise. "Company?" She said more to herself than to the door. "I...I...Yes, please come in." She forced out. The door opened and the young girl walked in. Right behind her was a Kuno retainer, a woman, carrying a tray.</p><p>"I thought you might like tea." Kiko said. She nodded to the retainer who placed the tea service on a small table then retreated to a position next to the door.</p><p>"That would...that would be nice." Hikaru replied. She looked at the retainer for a moment then nodded. "Does...does Ms. Kuno know you are h-h-here?" Hikaru grimaced as her stammer began to manifest itself as it did whenever she was stressed.</p><p>Kiko nodded. She smiled slightly. "We had a bit of an argument over it but..." She waved a negating hand. "It's not important." She pulled up a seat next to the table and poured tea for the two of them. "So...how are you?" She asked. Kiko placed the tea cup closer to Hikaru and waited for the changed hit man to take her cup before taking her own.</p><p>Hikaru hesitated before answering. "I'm...I'm not sure." She replied. Hikaru took a sip of her tea. "Yo-you'll probably th-think this is str-str-strange but..." Hikaru took another sip of her tea. "I'm b-beginning to for-for-forget." She put down her cup with a trembling hand and waved the same hand in a vague manner. "Be-being...being a-a-a man." For some reason Hikaru found it easier to talk to Kiko than...anyone else. "I-I-I feel like I'm dy-dy-dyiing."</p><p>Kiko nodded, not in comprehension, but in an odd form of sympathy. Many years before, one of her earliest visits iin fact, she had been wandering around the mansion. She had entered this very room and had found the woman she was to call Mother sobbing in a corner. Kiko glanced over to that corner. There was a stand there with a fresh bouquet of flowers. Kiko had crawled into Kodachi's lap and tried to give her as much comfort as she could. Kiko remembered how Kodachi had clutched at her and sobbed Ky's name over and over. Right now Kiko was fighting the very same urge to comfort this woman.</p><p>Kiko sighed. "Mother is Samurai." She said. "One of the things she loved about Ky , despite his birth, was that he had a code of honor." She smiled. "Of course a Samurai would have..." She gave Hikaru a sheepish shrug. 'Been a bit more permanent in their apology." She leaned forward. "She once told me that she thought the Yakusa had the more intelligent solution."</p><p>Hikaru smiled weakly. "I think I en-envy the Samurai." She said quietly. She looked down. "I-I tried again." She made a two handed motion to mime a knife through her belly. She swallowed in a suddenly dry voice. "I had..I had...I had..." She began to sob. With a visible effort Hikaru controlled her sobs. She took a breath. "I.." She paused and licked her lips. "I had the...knife." She said slowly. Hikaru touched her belly with one hand. "Here." She tapped her bellly. Hikaru licked her lips again. "And...and this t-time...I couldn't." Her voice dropped to a whisper. She raied a trembling hand as if it held the knife and looked at it. "Because I knew...I knew..." She repeated in hissing whisper. "There was something...someone," She tapped her belly again. "There." She last said in an almost inaudible breath.</p><p>HIkaru felt a hand on her shoulder and she slowly looked up to see Kiko looking back at her.</p><p>"You killed Ky Young Ji." She said in a voice that spoke of many conversations with her Auntie Nabiki. "I can't..." She waved her other hand. "No one can." She said. "Forgive that." She stared directly into Hikaru's eyes. Hikaru nodded slowly in defeated acceptance. "But..." Kiko put her arms around Hikaru's shoulders and hugged her. Hikaru's eyes filled with tears and she hugged Kiko back. Hikaru began to sob again.</p><p>Kiko held Hikaru and let the pink haired woman cry for many long minutes without saying anything. Eventually Hikaru cried herself out and fell into a sudden and deep sleep. The sleep of someone who had been denying themselves of true sleep for too long. Kiko pressed Hikaru back into the large chair. She was small enough that the chair made a fair sized bed. Kiko looked around. The up till now silent but watchful retainer hurried over with a blanket. Kiko smiled and covered Hikaru with the blanket.</p><p>Kiko looked at the sleeping Hikaru. 'Hika.' Kiko corrected herself mentally. She gave the sleeping former hitman a last look then turned and walked to the door. Kiko opened the door to find Kodachi Kuno standing just outside the door. "She's sleeping, Mother." Kiko said quietly. She took her adopted mother's hand and the two started walking slowly away. "I'm sorry about...earlier." Kiko said. "But..." Kiko shrugged. "I had to...talk to her."</p><p>"I know, sweetheart." Kodachi replied. She smiled a little wistfully at Kiko. "I think..." Kodachi looked down. "I think I was getting a little...jealous." She admitted.</p><p>"Mother." Kiko admonished playfully. She and Kodachi exchanged smiles. Kiko's smile fell. "She's so...broken." She looked back toward the room. "Much as I hate her, I can't help feeling sorry for her." She said.</p><p>Kodachi and Kiko walked along in silence until they reached the second floor of the mansion. They stopped in front of Kiko's room. Kiko looked at her watch. "Oh poo, I'd better hurry or I'll be late for deportment class." She said. Kiko leaned closer to Kodachi and kissed her adopted mother on the cheek. She and Kodachi looked at each other for a moment. Suddenly Kiko giggled. Kodachi raised an eyebrow in inquiry. "Do you think Madam Demille would be willing to take on a new student?" Kiko asked.</p><p>"A new...?" Kodachi stopped. "Oh ho ho ho." She laughed. "Kiko, that's so...evil." She said in approving appreciation. Kodachi nodded. "And surprisingly appropriate."</p><p>The next morning Hikaru was awakened by a knock on the door. The door opened and one of the retainers walked in pushing a breakfast cart. Right behind her was Kiko Kuno. "Good Morning, Hika." Kiko said cheerfully. "Rise and shine, you have a busy day ahead of you."</p><p>"Huh, what?" HIkaru said groggily. "Busy?" She mumbled.</p><p>"Very busy." Kiko agreed. "You'd better eat."</p><p>"B-busy?" Hikaru repeated.</p><p>"Eat first." Kiko ordered. "Then you are going to take a bath." She said. "And then...eat first." She said. Kiko pointed to the chair that the retainer had set next to the small table. "Eat."</p><p>Hikaru blinked in confusion then reluctantly rolled out of bed and sat down at the small table. The waiting retainer uncovered a tray and placed a bowl of rice porridge in front of the pink haired woman. The retainer then poured tea for Hikaru and Kiko. Hikaru looked at Kiko for a moment then slowly began to eat.</p><p>Kiko silently watched Hikaru eat. She had eaten earlier and just sipped tea as Hikaru, 'Hika' Kiko reminded herself, as Hikaru slowly ate. "Okay, now take a bath." Kiko said. "No arguments." She said brusquely.</p><p>"Yes, Kiko." Sighed Hikaru. Hikaru went to the small bathing area and quickly bathed, she returned quicker than Kiko had expected but she had already had the retainer lay out clothing for Hikaru to wear. Hikaru stared at the clothes on the bed. "That's...that's..."</p><p>"It's no different than what you wore to lunch the other day." Kiko said firmly. "Skirt, blouse, nothing unusual." She pointed out. "Now get dressed." She said. "Or do I have to call Kasumi?"</p><p>A faint smile appeared on Hikaru's face. "No, I...I j-j-just was su-su-surprised." Her hand clenched into a fist. "St-st-stupid st-st-st-stutter." She forced out. With a little help from Kiko and the silent retainer, Hikaru put on the conservative knee length gray skirt and white high necked and long sleeved blouse over the most conservative underwear the retainer was able to find. Hikaru looked in a mirror. "I l-l-look like a li-li-librarian." Hika said.</p><p>"You know that almost sounded like a joke." Kiko commented. "Okay now that you're dressed we can go." She looked at her watch. Kiko shook her head. "We're already late." She bemoaned. Kiko beckoned with one hand. "Well, come on." She said.</p><p>Hika followed Kiko down from the third floor to the first floor and to the small salon that had been set aside for Kiko's, and the occasional girl from Kodachi's club, deportment lessons. The steel gray haired woman looked up from her tea as Kiko and Hika entered the salon. "Please forgive me, Madam Demille." Kiko said. "It took longer to get Hika ready than I anticipated." She indicated Hika with a hand. "Madam Demille, may I introduce my Mother's guest, Hika." She said. "Hika, this is Madam Demille."</p><p>Madam Demille gave Kiko an approving nod. She looked at the pink haired woman. "So...you are Hika."</p><p>"Ye-ye-yes, Ma'am." Hika stammered out."Hi-hi-Hika." Hika slammed her fist into her side in frustration.</p><p>"That's a terrible stutter." Madam Demille said in concern. "Have you always stuttered?" She asked. Hika shook her head. "I see." Madam Demille looked at Hika curiously. "Walk for me." She ordered. She raised a hand. "Just walk." Hika nodded and silently walked back and forth. "My god." Exclaimed Madam Demille in horror. "You walk just like a man."</p><p>Madam Demille studied the pink haired woman as Hika walked back and forth. "You may sit." Hika sat and Madam Demille studied Hika. She shook her head. "Dreadful, simply dreadful." She exclaimed. "You even sit like a man." She said. "If you weren't obviously pregnant." Madam Demille's eyes narrowed as Hika flinched slightly. "Kiko, explain." She demanded.</p><p>"Hika is like Ranma Saotome, Madam Demille." Kiko replied. "Only she can't turn back."</p><p>"I see." Madam Demille said quietly in understanding. Hika nodded shakily. Madam Demille smiled. "Why don't we have tea?"</p><p>A half hour later Madam Demille had Hika comfortable enough that she began correcting her posture. "Head up , Hika." Madam Demille said. "A lady always keeps her head up."</p><p>"Why?" Hika said in a near whisper.</p><p>"So she can spit in the eye of whoever tries to bring her low." Madam Demille said firmly. "A Lady may break but she will not bend." Madam Demille said fiercely. "And a true Lady is very, very hard to break." Hika raised her head slowly. "Better." Madam Demille said in approval. "Be proud of who and what you are." She directed,</p><p>"I-I-I..." HIka clenched her fist in frustration as she began to stammer again.</p><p>"Take your time." Madam Demille said gently.</p><p>"I'm...tr-trying ..." HIka began. "It's h-hard being a.a.a wo-wo-woman."</p><p>"Tell me something I don't know, Hika." Madam Demille said in amusement. "Even for one born a woman." She said. "And harder still to be a lady." She said. "But if you're willing to try, I think you will do well." Madam Demille sat back in her chair. "Class is almost over." She said. "I do hope you will come back."</p><p>Hika was silent for a long moment. "I-I..." She took a breath. "I would l-like that."</p><p>"Excellent." Madam Demille said in approval. "Tomorrow then." She said. "Kiko, a moment if you please."</p><p>"Wait by the door, Hika." Kiko said. "When Madam Demille says a moment, she usually means it." She said. HIka nodded and walked out of the salon. Kiko turned. "Yes, Madam Demille?"</p><p>"She was raped, wasn't she?" Madam Demille said in tones of cold fury.</p><p>"Yes, Madam Demille." Kiko agreed.</p><p>"I do hope Kodachi has...dealt with the creature who did it." Madam Demille continued.</p><p>"That will be unlikely, Madam Demille." Kiko replied. "It's very complicated and..." Kiko paused. "It's complicated." She said. "Hika is...was Hikaru Nakamura...the man who killed Ky Young Ji." She said. "And the man who raped her, raped her in order to get her pregnant...is a woman."</p><p>Madam Demille bit back an oath. Her frequent visits and conversations with the many women she had trained had given Genvieve Demille a very complete understanding of everything that Kodachi Kuno and Nabiki, Thei Lady Kuno, were involved in. The name Hikaru Nakamura was not unknown to her. Many things were not unknown to her. She had even been to the club a number of times and had developed a friendship with the notorious Miss Nodoka. Much of what she had learned had been verified by the elegant Geisha.</p><p>Madam Demille took a breath and held it for a moment. "I see." She said finally. "Complicated..." She shook her head. "You have Kodachi's gift for understatement." She said. Madam Demille thought for a moment. "Well that's neither here nor there." She said finally. "I'll expect the two of you tomorrow." She said briskly.</p><p>"Of course, Madam Demille." Kiko replied. She gave the older woman a grateful smile. "And thank you." Kiko bowed, turned and walked away. She found Hika waiting for her on the other side of the door. "See?" She said. "I wasn't long at all." She looked at the pink haired woman. HIka was looking down. "I have lessons for the rest of the morning but..."</p><p>"Wou-would you mind if...stayed with you?" Hika asked. "I d-don't f-feel like..."</p><p>"It's going to be boring." Kiko promised with a smile. "Sure, come on."</p><p>Hika spent the rest of the morning with Kiko. As Kiko promised the rest of the morning was spent with her tutor. The class was held in a small library and while Kiko poured over her text books, Hika found a comfortable chair next to a handy bookshelf. She idly picked a book off the shelf and just as idly leafed through it. Every so often she would rub her gently swelling belly. It was a strangely domestic scene, strange in its's very normalcy.</p><p>Hika felt herself relax more than she had in over a year. Hika, as Hikaru, had always considered women nothing more than accessories. Their purpose was to look good and provide sex whenever he demanded it. Nothing more, nothing less. He had never cared about or even considered that women might have needs and desires that did not include him. "I never cared." Hika said quietly to herself.</p><p>That evening, Hika found herself invited to dinner. It was a relatively intimate dinner with Kodachi, Kiko, Kiko's Mother Koko and Koko's fiance, Hiro. It was the other three people in attendance that nearly caused Hika to bolt and run to her room as she found herself the subject of intense scrutiny from Tatewki, Lord Kuno, Nabiki, Lady Kuno and the Lady Kimi. It was not the baleful glare from Lord Kuno that unnerved Hika, it was the sadly amused looks she was receiving from Nabiki and Kimi.</p><p>Hika nervously approached the dinner table and took her place next to Kiko and opposite Tatewaki, Nabiki and Kimi. Hika was wearing the same conservative outfit she had worn all day. In an odd way, the very conservativeness of her outfit was soothing. HIka looked down at the table in an attempt to avoid acknowledging the stares she was receiving.</p><p>"Head up." Kiko hissed out of the side of her mouth. "You're supposed to at least act like a lady."</p><p>Startled, HIka raised her head and found herself looking into the eyes of Nabiki and Kimi. They had that same sadly amused look, yet Hika had the feeling that they were not laughing at her but rather that Hika was, or should be, in on a private joke.</p><p>"Stop glaring at Hika, lover." Kimi said to Tatewaki. "It's impolite."</p><p>"I must agree with Lady Kimi, Brother." Kodachi said. She turned to Hika. "Don't mind my brother, Hika." Kodachi said. "He has difficulty getting over even the least slight." She said. "Why it took him years to get over being defeated by..." Kodachi grinned evilly. "Ranko."</p><p>"Sister." Tatewaki said reprovingly.</p><p>"Ranko is very...sk-sk-skilled." Hika stammered queitly. "She d-d-defeated me." She said. "N-n-n-no." Hika squeezed a hand to make a fist. "No shame." She forced out.</p><p>"Listen to Hika, Brother." Kodachi said. She turned to Hika again. "I'm glad to see you're starting to get control of your stammer." She said.</p><p>"I cannot believe this." Tatewaki exclaimed. "Have all of you taken leave of your senses?'" He asked. He pointed to Hika. "You're all acting like she's some, some...that's Hikaru." He said angrily.</p><p>"Hikaru?" Kodachi replied calmly. "Hikaru is dead, Brother." She said in the same calm tone. "He died at the hands of the Joketsuzoku over a year ago." She turned to Hika. "Isn't that right, Hika?" She asked in a challenging tone.</p><p>Hika stared at Kodachi for a very long time before she finally nodded. "Yes." She said quietly. "Hi-Hikaru is dead." Hika was surprised at the sudden relief that came with her statement. She swallowed."Hikaru is dead." She repeated in a stronger voice.</p><p>Nabiki lifted her glass and took a sip of water. She stared at Hika over the rim of the glass. She put the glass down and nodded. "And who would know better than someone who...saw him die." She looked at Hika and nodded again. "Thank you for...bringing us the news." She said. "It lifts a great weight off my mind." She said. "Now, I think we will speak no more of...Hikaru."</p><p>"I agree." Kodachi said firmly. She turned to Hika. "Do try the smoked salmon, Hika." She said. "Not only does it taste wonderful but it's full of healthy omega three oils." She said. "Just what your body needs."</p><p>"Sister." Tatewaki having held silent too long nearly shouted. "I can't believe..." He began.</p><p>"Brother stop." Kodachi replied quickly. "It's over, Hikaru is dead." She put her hand on Hika's shoulder. "Hikaru's soul can burn in every hell possible for all eternity." She declared. "Hika's soul... is innocent of his crimes."</p><p>Tatewaki glared at the pink haired woman for some time but slowly his glare changed to a puzzled examination. Hika, with a little prodding from Kiko, had again raised her head though she didn't meet anyone's eyes with her own. What puzzled Tatewaki was that, though he knew Hika was Hikaru, his senses both his trained regular ones and his Ki sense were telling him that the person in front of him was not only really a woman but not Hikaru. He had met Hikaru Nakamura and had fought him. Tatewaki would have recognized Hikaru in the dark. His brow furrowed. 'This is not...him.' He thought. "So be it." He said quietly.</p><p>Hika's lips trembled slightly. Partially because of the reminder of her condition and partially the emotional aftermath of accepting Kodachi's ...offer. 'Hikaru is dead.' She thought. Hika looked at Kodachi. "Th-thank you." Hika paused. "Ms. Kuno." She said.</p><p>Only a slight widening of her eyes betrayed any surprise at Hika's words. "Not at all, Hika." Kodachi replied. "I would do the same thing." She said. "For any of my girls." She finished.</p><p>Nabiki and Kimi exchanged glances. Kimi nodded in response to an unasked question and sat back. Nabiki returned her attention to Hika for a moment then looked at Kodachi. "Speaking of your girls." Nabiki said. "Your Miki has conveyed a request from Cologne for a meeting." She nodded to Hika. "To discuss, Hika." She said. The pink haired woman flinched hard. "And Hika's child."</p><p>"Neither are negotiable." Kodachi replied sternly. "If Hika wishes to go with her..."</p><p>"No." Hika wailed in despair and horror.</p><p>"Then it's settled." Kodachi stated.</p><p>"I never said I was planning on negotiating at all." Nabiki said. She sipped water from her glass. Nabiki put the glass down. "We will discuss Hika and the child." She said. "She will ask for the one or the other, I will say no and then...we will see what happens."</p><p>"D-dangerous." Hika stammered. "C-c-cologne is v-very dangerous."</p><p>Nabiki smiled her best Ice Queen smile. "So am I, Hika." She replied in icy tones. "So am I."</p><p>End Chapter 3</p>
