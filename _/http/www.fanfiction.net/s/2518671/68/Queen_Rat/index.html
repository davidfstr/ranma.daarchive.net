</div><p>Chapter 7</p><p>'Learning the Basics'</p><p>Two very tired teen-aged girls dragged themselves into their suite and threw themselves on a couch. "Gods, I'm glad that's over." Kagomi moaned. She leaned over and started rubbing her foot. "I need a bath and then I'm going to sleep for the rest of the weekend."</p><p>Pema giggled. "They keep us very, very busy, yes." She agreed.</p><p>"Busy?" Kagomi snorted. "I feel like I ran a marathon." She giggled back. "I gotta admit, it's been a lot of fun." She said. "And it's only the first day."</p><p>Pema nodded. "Kagomi want bet they all have tummy ache tomorrow?" She and Kagomi laughed. "Pema not believe little girls eat so much." She looked at Kagomi. "Bath sound like best idea."She said. "Pema wash Kagomi back."</p><p>"I don't remember the last time someone washed my back." Kagomi jumped to her feet. "Let's go." They entered the bathing area. "Damn this place is huge." Kagomi said as she started removing her clothes. "I mean, look at the size of that tub." She shook her head. "I bet you could put six people in it."</p><p>Pema nodded. She pointed to a stool. "Kagomi sit. Pema wash Kagomi back. Kagomi wash Pema back and then we get in big, big tub."</p><p>"Sounds like a plan." Kagomi replied. She sat down. Pema knelt behind Kagomi and washed the girl's back. Kagomi returned the favor and it wasn't that much later that the two teen girls were sitting side by side in the oversized tub. "Ahh, that feels great." Kagomi said. Pema nodded in agreement. "Thanks again for inviting me, Pema."</p><p>Pema smiled. The two teen-aged girls soaked for a time in the tub and then, regretfully, left the tub, dried off and wrapped in towels returned to the bedroom. They quickly got into their night clothes. "You sure do where a lot of green." Kagomi commented seeing the nightgown Pema put on.</p><p>"That because Ranma like Pema wear green." Pema replied. "Oh, that remind Pema, must call Ranma, say goodnight." Pema walked over to a vanity and picked up her cellphone. She punched in a number. "Hi Ranma, it Pema." She said warmly when the phone was answered. Pema nodded. "Pema having good time." She said. "But Pema miss Ranma. Does Ranma miss Pema?" She asked. Pema sighed happily. "Pema so happy." She made a kissing sound into the phone. Pema giggled. "Now Ranma remember give goodnight kiss to Akane and Ukyo for Pema." Pema spoke for several minutes more before signing off with more kisses into the phone. Pema hung up and sighed.</p><p>"You know you sounded more like you were talking to your boyfriend then a guardian." Kagomi remarked with a giggle. "Except for the part about Akane and Ukyo." She said. "I don't think you tell a boyfriend to kiss other girls." Kagomi frowned. "Not that I'd know." She grumped. "That's the worst thing about living with gramps." She said. "No boys."</p><p>Pema made a dismissive sound. "Pema not care about boys." She said. "Pema have Ranma." She said. Pema pouted slightly. "Even if Ranma think Pema too young." Pema brightened. "Oh well, Akane say Pema not be too young forever."</p><p>Kagomi smiled sympathetically. "Sure Pema." She said. 'Man, she really has a crush on Ranma. They're probably just humoring her.' She thought. 'Not that I blame her.' She admitted to herself. "Those eyes." She said aloud. Kagomi blushed at Pema's giggle. "Did I say that out loud?"</p><p>Pema nodded cheerfully. "Pema agree. Ranma have beautiful eyes." Pema got into her futon and pulled the covers up to her waist. "All of Ranma beautiful." She said in a longing voice.</p><p>"Can't argue with that." Kagomi agreed. Kagomi nodded to herself. "Yeah, I guess compared to Ranma boys are, well, boys." Kagomi admitted.</p><p>"Little boys." Pema amplified in smug tones. "Not big man, like Ranma." Pema shook her head. "All this talk about Ranma make Pema miss Ranma more." She said moodily. "Wish Ranma here to cuddle Pema." She looked at Kagomi. "Ranma cuddle nice." Pema said.</p><p>"Cuddle?" Kigoma asked in surprise. "You mean, like in bed?" She asked slowly. Pema nodded. "I don't think you're supposed to cuddle with your guardian."</p><p>Pema laughed. "What better place to cuddle?" Pema asked. "And where Pema be safer than in Ranma arms?"</p><p>"And where's Akane and Ukyo when you and Ranma are...cuddling?" Kagomi asked in worried tones.</p><p>"Oh they there." Pema said reasonably. "Sometime Pema cuddle between Akane and Ranma. Sometime between Ranma and Ukyo." She sighed happily. "Pema feel so warm, so safe. Sometime Pema not want get out of bed."</p><p>Kagomi breathed a sigh of relief. 'For a minute...but if Akane and Ukyo are there, then they're just cuddling.' She thought. "Sounds like fun." Kagomi admitted. "I never cuddled with anyone." She said in regretful tones.</p><p>"No?" Pema said in surprise. She raised the edge of the blanket. "Kagomi can cuddle with Pema if Kagomi want." She said.</p><p>"Well..." Kagomi drawled in indecision.</p><p>"Please." Pema begged. "Maybe Pema not miss Ranma so much." She said. "Please."</p><p>Kagomi giggled. "Oh. Okay." She said. Kagomi scooted over to Pema's futon. "Um, which way?" She asked.</p><p>Pema giggled. "Get in." She directed. Kagomi got under the covers with Pema and lay on her back. Pema placed an arm over Kagomi. "Nice yes?"</p><p>"Well it's warm." Kagomi admitted. "Kind of close though."</p><p>Pema giggled again. "Kagomi really never cuddle." She said in amusement. "What you think cuddle mean?" Pema tightened her hold on Kagomi. "This cuddling." She said. "Sometimes I not know which arm belong Pema or belong Ranma or Akane or Ukyo." Pema giggled again.</p><p>"You do this every night?" Kagomi asked.</p><p>"Almost every night." Pema replied. She rested her head on Kagomi's shoulder. "Kagomi have nice shoulder." She lifted her head and kissed Kagomi on the cheek. "Thank you, Kagomi." Pema placed her head back on Kagomi's shoulder. "Night Kagomi."</p><p>"Night Pema." Kagomi replied.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>There was a knock on the door to the inner club. Only one person ever knocked and Botan Abe immediately got to his feet and opened the door. A woman, wearing the makeup and kimono of a professional Geisha, stood framed in the doorway. Standing just behind her were two young men in their twenties. Abe bowed deeply. "Good evening, Auntie." Abe rumbled.</p><p>"Good evening, Abe." Nodoka replied in a melodic voice. "Have you lost weight?" She asked.</p><p>"A little, Auntie." Abe replied. "Rei, well, you know how it is."</p><p>"Indeed I do." Nodoko replied with an approving smile. She nodded to the bouncer and made her way to the outer club. The club, usually quiet, even when busy, became even quieter as Nodoka made her entrance. Nodoka unfolded a fan and held it in front of her face as she walked slowly around the outer club. What had started as a caprice was now a tradition. Every night Nodoka, usually in full Geisha mode, would come out of the inner club and select a small number of hopefuls and allow them into the inner club. Being invited into the most exclusive club in Tokyo was a prize that more and more people, couples especially, hoped for.</p><p>Nodoka fluttered her fan as she walked slowly around the club. She always made a full circuit of the club before making her selections and the various patrons followed her path like a flower follows the sun. Nodoka stopped at a table. "My, what an attractive couple." She said to the young man and woman seated there. She sat down much to the nervous pleasure of the couple. "Newlyweds?" She asked.</p><p>"Y-yes M-miss Nodoka." The man stammered, using the agreed upon greeting. The young woman nodded wide-eyed.</p><p>"Wonderful." She said. "Would the two of you care to join me at my table?" Without waiting for an answer Nodoka returned to her feet. The young couple shot to their feet and followed Nodoka back to the inner club. The young man and woman looked around in awe.</p><p>"It's beautiful." the young woman said in a hushed voice. "Like something out of an old movie."</p><p>"I'll be sure to tell Kodachi you liked it." Nodoka said in regal tones. "So few seem to appreciate the effort she has made." They stopped at Nodoka's private table and Nodoka sat down. She was immediately flanked by the two young men. "Please sit." Nodoka said to the newlyweds. Once they had seated themselves, Nodoka raised a languid hand. A waitress hurried over. "Ah, Fumie." Nodoka greeted the waitress.</p><p>"Good evening, Auntie." Fumie replied. She looked at the newlyweds. "Hey, you guys are cute." She chirped. "The usual Auntie?" She asked Nodoka.</p><p>"If you would, Fumie." Nodoka replied. Fumie nodded and walked away.</p><p>"I feel like I'm in the presence of royalty." The young woman whispered nervously to her husband. The man nodded. "Th-thank you for inviting us, Miss Nodoka." The woman said.</p><p>"My pleasure." Nodoka replied. "Please, tell me about yourselves." She said. "Why don't you start with your names." Nodoka suggested.</p><p>"Isamu Cho, Miss Nodoka." The young man replied. "This is my wife, Kotone."</p><p>"Kotone, my that's a beautiful name." Nodoka said. "And you've been married, how long?"</p><p>"A week, Miss Nodoka." Kotone replied with a blush.</p><p>"A week?" Nodoka exclaimed in delight. "Newlyweds indeed." Nodoka laughed gently. Nodoka, being the superb hostess she was, quickly made the young couple comfortable. Fumie returned with a bottle of champagne and placed it in a ice bucket next to the couple. One of the young men flanking Nodoka, Jiro, stood and filled several fluted glasses. "A toast." Nodoka said. "To Isamu and Kotone Cho, may you have many happy years together." They drank.</p><p>A fanfare brought the couples attention to the stage. A young woman with extremely long black hair and wearing an iridescent green and blue, tight fitting and low-cut, gown, walked to center stage. A black man wearing dark green pants, a white shirt with vertical green stripes, green arm bands and a dark green fedora, walked to a piano. He sat and began playing a jazzy blues riff.</p><p>As Noriko had observed, Rei needed live music and a search was made to find just the right musician. While they hadn't specifically looked for a black man, the moment Ron Jackson, the pianist's name, walked into the club they knew they had found their 'Sam'.</p><p>Ron played and Rei sang and the couple felt as if they had been transported to some bygone era. "All that's missing, is a fat man in the corner." Kotone whispered with a quiet giggle. "Oops, spoke to soon." She said a moment later. "Look to your left." Isamu looked and there was indeed a fat man at a corner table. A pretty redhead sat next to him. "All he's missing is a fez."</p><p>"We have tried to get him to wear one." Nodoka said in amusement. She gave the redhead a sour look that she quickly hid.</p><p>Kotone sighed as Rei sang one love ballad after another. "She's wonderful." She said in awe. "Everything's wonderful." After Rei sang and the stage was cleared a half dozen women in tight shorts, blouses tied just under their breasts and their hair done in vintage 40's styles came onstage and performed a dance routine that was energetic, skilled and sexy enough to border on erotic.</p><p>Nodoka smiled indulgently as the young couple were swept up in the evening. Nodoka convinced the young woman to dance with both Jiro and Daisuke while she claimed a dance from Isamu. The evening ended with the young couple dancing slowly together as the piano player tinkled the ivories.</p><p>Nodoka lounged against the back of her booth. Jiro and Daisuke sat comfortably close by. Nodoka looked up as someone approached. She frowned. "Oh, Suki." She said cooly. Nodoka tilted her head. "Is something wrong?" The redhead looked down. She nodded almost imperceptibly. "What has Genma done now?" Nodoka asked in exasperation.</p><p>"Genma." Suki licked dry lips. "It's not Genma, Mrs. Saotome." She said in a sad voice. "I-I think..." Suddenly Suki sat down. "Wh-why am I the only girl who can't call you Auntie?" Suki sobbed.</p><p>"Boys, leave us." Nodoka ordered. "And close the curtain." She looked at Suki. "Come here, Suki." She patted the seat next to her. "Come here, child." Suki hesitantly moved to sit next to Nodoka as the black curtain closed to give them some privacy. "Talk to me." She ordered.</p><p>"I-I th-thought I was doing what you wanted." Suki said in a tearful rush. "I-I k-keep him busy, I-I even tie my hair in that stupid pigtail when we, when we...I'm trying, I'm really trying." She wailed. "Why?"</p><p>Nodoka sighed and touched a button under the table. A minute later Fumie stuck her head through the curtain. She frowned at seeing the crying redhead. "What's the matter with Suki?"</p><p>"In your opinion does Suki have what is necessary to continue working here?" Nodoka asked calmly.</p><p>"What's necessary?" Fumie parted the curtain and sat down next to Suki. "Of course she does." She said. "Of course you do, Suki. You're one of our best girls."</p><p>"Apparently not everyone agrees with you." Nodoka said in slightly sour tones. "One member of our family has not been giving Suki the respect she deserves." She sighed. "Unfortunately that person happens to be me." Nodoka shook her head. "I can understand if you wish to leave, Suki and if that is your decision I will of course give you a letter of recommendation, but..." Nodoka broke off.</p><p>"I don't want to leave, Mrs. Saotome." Suki said forcefully. "I just want, I just want." She broke off. "Please, Mrs. Saotome, tell me what I've done wrong."</p><p>"Nothing Suki, you did nothing wrong." Nodoka sighed. "If anyone deserves respect around here, you do." She snorted. "Especially putting up with Genma." Nodoka said tartly. She smiled slightly as Suki nodded. "No, the fault is mine." Nodoka said contritely. "I hope you'll find it in your heart to give me another chance." She said.</p><p>"Oh Mrs. Saotome." Suki began.</p><p>Nodoka raised a finger. "Auntie." She said. "If you would."</p><p>Suki smiled a tremulous smile. "Thank you, Auntie. That's all I ever wanted." She wiped her eyes. "I suppose I should go back to work." She said in a voice that shook slightly with emotion. "You know how Genma gets." Suki sniffed.</p><p>"I do indeed." Nodoka replied. "Fumie, please arrange for Suki to take a vacation. I think a week at an Onsen would do you good." She said to the redhead. "And , of course, a new wardrobe is a must." Nodoka smiled. "And when you come back, we'll see if we can, shall we say, find something less onerous for you to do."</p><p>Suki laughed shakily. "No, that's okay...Auntie." Suki said in almost a shy voice. "It's not that bad, and someone has to do it." Suki stood. "Thank you for listening, Auntie." She bowed to Nodoka and walked away.</p><p>Nodoka sighed. "Was I the only one who didn't know?" She asked quietly. "Don't answer that, I'm afraid the answer would be yes." Nodoka sighed again. "She's on permanent retainer, isn't she?"</p><p>"Yes Auntie." Fumie replied. "Your Husband isn't known for tipping." She added coolly. "What do you want to do?"</p><p>"Make it up to her somehow." Nodoka said firmly. "At the very least we can increase the retainer fee." She said.</p><p>"With an appropriate bonus?" Fumie suggested meaningfully.</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "I will leave the size of the bonus up to you." Nodoka said. "Thank you Fumie."</p><p>"You're welcome Auntie." Fumie stood. She smiled. "Shall I send the boys back in?" She asked. "You look like you could use a little comforting yourself."</p><p>"Yes please." Nodoka said. "And Fumie." Nodoka said. The waitress turned. "Thank you again."</p><p>"Any time, Auntie." Fumie replied with a smile. She walked out of the booth, almost immediately Jiro and Daisuke re-entered.</p><p>"Is everything alright, Miss Nodoka?" Jiro asked in concern.</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "Yes, thank you Jiro." She replied. "How are our newlyweds?" She asked.</p><p>Daisuke chuckled. "Oblivious." He replied. "Ron said he'll play as long as they're here."</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka stood. "I think I'll go to the suite." She said. "Will you join me?"</p><p>Jiro and Daisuke looked at each other. They smiled. "Of course, Miss Nodoka." They chorused.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The door to Captain Chikato's office opened and a tall, muscular man with long black hair tied into a pigtail walked in. He wore an expensive gray silk suit. "Hey Chikato." Ranma greeted the police officer.</p><p>"Ranma." Captain Chikato Noriudo replied in cool tones. "You're alone?" He said questioningly. "I said I wanted to see all of you." He pointed out. "You really need to keep this bar better stocked." A female voice said to his left. Chikato turned to see two women, one black haired and muscular and the other taller, slim and brown haired, busy at his wet bar. "I won't ask how you did that." The captain said evenly. He pointed to several chairs in front of him. "Sit."</p><p>"We're good." Akane said easily. "You got any ice?" She asked. "Ah, here it is." She said in discovery. "Your usual, Chikato?"</p><p>"I'm not in the mood for games." The captain said in annoyance. He looked at Ranma. "I should arrest the three of you right now." He said coldly.</p><p>"Arrest?" Ranma protested. "We didn't do nothin."</p><p>"Fucking a fifteen year old girl is considered rape." Chikato Noriudo replied angrily. "Even if she asks for it."</p><p>"Give us some credit, Chikato." Ranma snapped back. "We're not fucking her." He said. "And she's nearly sixteen."</p><p>"So, she sucks your cock instead?" Chikato growled back.</p><p>"You mind telling us how you know?" Ranma asked. "I know it wasn't Gos, we can tell when he's around." Ranma tilted his head and gave the Police Captain a glare. "You were guessing, you were fucking guessing, weren't you?"</p><p>"I'm a cop, remember?" Chikato growled. "You're acting like a fucking pimp, you know that?" Chikato snapped. "Next thing you'll be having her turning tricks." The captain turned at the twin barks of laughter from Akane and Ukyo. "What's funny?" He asked angrily.</p><p>"Acting like a pimp." Akane laughed. "Ranma is a pimp." Akane pointed out. "The only difference is that he turned out his girl side too." Akane said coldly. "Just as you wanted."</p><p>"Me?" Chikato's head snapped back in disbelief.</p><p>"You." Akane replied. "Who got us stripping in the first place, hmm?" Akane jerked her chin at Ukyo. "And wasn't that what you wanted Uk-chan to be; our pimp?"</p><p>"And me and the Tomboy as the ho's." Ranma added with a grin.</p><p>"It was a cover." Chikato replied in annoyed tones. "It wasn't supposed to be real."</p><p>"Oh, like stripping isn't real. Lap dances aren't real." Ukyo rolled her eyes. "What do you think happens when we go home?" She asked in a near growl. "You think we go home and take long showers to wipe off the stink?" She asked sarcastically.</p><p>Akane raised a hand dramatically to her forehead. "Oh woe is me, For I am a fallen woman." Akane said in a exagerated pained voice. She made a spitting gesture. "Get real." She snapped. "Face it, Chikato, we are what you wanted." She took a healthy swallow of her drink. "What you needed." She added. "You wanted us deep, we're deep."</p><p>"The only difference between what you wanted and what we're doing is that Ran-chan is playing Big Daddy, not me." Ukyo said. Ukyo chuckled. There was no humor in her chuckle."Good thing too, since I don't really have the equipment to pull it off." She said. "It works better this way." Ukyo shrugged. "As for Pema..."</p><p>"We're not hurting her." Ranma interrupted. "If anything she's better off than most." Ranma stood and leaned across the desk and brought his face close to the Police Captain. "Stay. Out. Of. Our. Business." He snarled.</p><p>Chikato to his credit didn't even blink and met Ranma's stare and returned his own glare. "Sit down." Chikato ordered in a quiet voice. Ranma held his glare for a moment and then sat back down. "I can't cover you if this comes out." Chikato said coldly. "You get caught, you go down."</p><p>"Fair enough." Akane said. She walked over to Chikato's desk and sat on the edge. "What did you really want to see us about?" She took a sip of her drink and looked at Chikato over the rim. "I know you Chikato, you don't threaten, you act. If you really thought Pema was in any danger you'd have already taken her away," Akane took another sip. "What's up?" She asked.</p><p>"You should have cleared it with me before you broke cover." Snapped the captain.</p><p>"Oh relax, Chikato." Ranma said. "Our cover, such as it is, still works." Ranma shook his head. "People only believe what they want to believe." He said. "And people don't want to believe in magic."</p><p>"Well the crowds at the Kabuki have gotten bigger." Ukyo admitted. "And more people are ordering hot tea." Ukyo waved a dismissive hand. "As Ran-chan says, it still works." Ukyo drained her glass. "Anything else?" She asked. "No?" Ukyo stood. Ranma and Akane stood as well. "Then we'll be off." She grinned. "Pema's coming home tomorrow and we got things to do."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Kagomi woke in the middle of the night. Something had disturbed her. Somehow, while they slept, Kagomi had ended up on her back and Pema lay nearly on top of her. Pema's hand was caressing one of Kagomi's breasts and Pema's leg was between both of Kagomi's. A quick look at Pema made Kagomi realize the Tibetan girl was fast asleep.</p><p>"Akane." Murmurred Pema sleepily as her hand continued to caress Kagomi's breast.</p><p>'Akane?' Kagomi thought in surprise. "Pema." Kagomi said softly. "Wake up." The Tibetan girl just snuggled closer. "Pema." Kagomi said in a louder voice.</p><p>"Hm?" Pema said muzzily. "What?" Pema slowly opened her eyes. "It morning?" She asked in faint tones.</p><p>"No, it's still night." Kagomi replied.</p><p>"Why you wake Pema?" Pema asked in a sleepy voice.</p><p>"Well, um, you see." Kagomi said hesitantly. "Your hand." She nodded with her chin. "It, um, it seems, um, you're touching, um."</p><p>"You wake Pema for that?" Pema said in sleepy complaint. "Pema go back to sleep." Within seconds Pema's breathing became more regular. Her hand seemed firmly attached to Kagomi's breast. "Ukyo." Pema murmured.</p><p>'Oh great, now what do I do?" Kagomi asked herself. She reached down and gently pulled Pema's hand off her breast. "Better." She muttered. Kagomi closed her eyes. She opened them a minute later when Pema's hand once again attached itself to her breast. "Akane." Murmured Pema. Kagomi rolled her eyes and removed Pema's hand and moved it to her waist. Pema wiggled for a second then settled down. Kagomi breathed a sigh of relief and closed her eyes.</p><p>Kagomi found it difficult to get back to sleep. While cuddling with Pema turned out to be more comforting than she had expected it also triggered feelings within Kagomi. 'Not to mention having someone play with my tits was nice.' She thought wryly. Pema squirmed against Kagomi and Pema's head moved to her breasts. 'If she starts, oh great..." Kagomi rolled her eyes. 'Her hand was bad enough, now...' Kagomi shivered when Pema's mouth captured a breast. "Eep." She squeaked aloud. "Pema." Kagomi said urgently. "Wake up."</p><p>"hnh." Pema mumbled. "Wha..Kagomi?" Pema said sleepily. "Why you wake Pema this time?" She complained.</p><p>"Cause you're molesting me in your sleep." Kagomi said in forced light tones. "You're worse than the last boy I went out with." She complained. Kagomi rolled her eyes. "At least he called my by the right name." She said. "You can't decide if I'm Akane or Ukyo." Kagomi said.</p><p>Pema giggled sleepily. "Sorry, Kagomi." Pema said. "I try remember to say Kagomi." Pema promised.</p><p>"That's not what I meant." Kagomi replied in sour tones. "And could you stop playing with my boobs when I'm yelling at you?" She added."I'm surprised Akane or Ukyo haven't complained."</p><p>Pema giggled again. "No, they no complain." Pema said. "Pema not know Pema do that." She explained. "Pema hope Kagomi not mad."</p><p>Kagomi blew out a breath. "No, I'm not mad." She said. "I'm worried, Pema."</p><p>"Worried?" Pema asked in puzzled tones. "Why you worried?"</p><p>"Oh come on Pema." Kagomi said shortly. "You told me you..." Kagomi made air quotes with her fingers. Not that Pema could see her hands from her position but Kagomi made them anyway. "Cuddle with Ranma." She pointed out. "Now you're grabbing my tits and calling out Akane and Ukyo's names." She blew out another breath. "Come on Pema, what's really going on?"</p><p>"Kagomi friend, yes?" Pema asked quietly. Kagomi nodded. "If Pema tell Kagomi something, she not tell, keep secret?" Kagomi nodded cautiously. Pema licked her lips. "Before Pema come Japan. Before Pema sold to bad mans. Pema live with family. Family always hungry." Pema lay back down and put her head on Kagomi's shoulder. "Mama say; family hungry, not enough to eat. Pema be good girl, do what she told." Pema sighed. "Mama say; Man come, Pema go with man. Do what man want. Not complain." Pema said. "And man come." Kagomi wrapped her arms around Pema. Pema smiled sadly. "Man ugly but Pema good girl, do what Mama say. Do what man say. But man not say anything." Pema closed her eyes from the pain of remembrance. "Man hurt Pema. Hit Pema. Give Pema bad medicine. Drugs, Ranma say." Pema shrugged. "Medicine make Pema feel good. Not care what happen to Pema." She said. "And man do things to Pema. Touch and..." Pema stopped. "And Pema knew, inside, this Pema fate." She took a deep shuddering breath. "Inside, Pema die."</p><p>"Oh Pema, I'm so sorry." Kagomi said in a shaky voice. "I didn't know."</p><p>"It alright, Kagomi." Pema replied quietly. "Then Ranma come." Pema's voice took on a hush. "Ranma take me to his home. He no need do that." Pema said in an almost questioning tone. "But he take Pema home. Pema meet Akane and Ukyo." Pema's voice took on happier notes. "Ranma say; this Pema, she live with us." Pema looked up at Kagomi. "And Akane and Ukyo say; Pema, this your home. We your family." She said. "And, inside, Pema begin live again."</p><p>"Whoa." Breathed Kagomi. "But..."</p><p>"No but, Kagomi." Pema interrupted softly. "Pema cook for Ranma. Clean for Ranma. Pema do anything for Ranma." Pema smiled slightly. "Pema expect Ranma make Pema his woman right away but Ranma wait. Ranma say; Pema too young." Pema shook her head. "For two year, Ranma not touch Pema. For two year, Ranma think of Pema as little sister." She said with a pout in her voice. "Ranma still think Pema too young but then Akane say; Pema want be Ranma woman. Pema should be Ranma woman. Pema learn how be Ranma woman."</p><p>"Akane?" Kagomi said in surprise.</p><p>"Akane." Pema confirmed. "Akane say; it time Pema learn basics." Pema giggled. "Basics lots fun."</p><p>"Basics?" Kagomi asked.</p><p>Pema nodded. "Akane teach Pema how to use hands, mouth to please Ranma." Though Kagomi could not see, Pema blushed. "Akane say; Pema good girl, make Ranma happy." Pema sighed happily. "Then Ukyo say; Ranma become girl, Pema must learn make girl Ranma happy." She said. "And Ukyo teach." Pema laughed quietly. "Pema not know which more fun." She said. "But if it make Ranma happy, Pema do." Pema said firmly. "Sometime it make Ranma happy when Pema make Akane, Ukyo happy." Pema smiled reassuringly at Kagomi. "Pema very, very happy to be Ranma woman. Pema want be Ranma woman. From day Ranma save Pema it all Pema ever want." Pema smiled softly. "Now Ranma say; Pema Ranma woman, and inside, Pema fly." Pema sighed happily. "Kagomi understand now?" She asked. "Kagomi see there no need to worry?"</p><p>Kagomi blew out a breath, then nodded slowly.</p><p>"Thank you, Kagomi." Pema said. "Now we try sleep again?" She asked in a drowsy voice.</p><p>"Are you kidding?" Kagomi replied. "After what you just told me?" She shook Pema slightly. "Come on, Pema, you gotta tell me everything." She demanded. "Please?" She begged.</p><p>Pema giggled. "In morning, Kagomi." Pema yawned. "Pema tell Kagomi in morning."</p><p>End Chapter 7</p><p>Author's Notes: What? Did you think I'd turn Pema into a sex toy without comment? Not gonna happen. The thing is, Ranma really is a pimp now. While I never wrote a chapter explicitly showing Ranma in pimp mode, he has become Big Daddy. Oh it's true neither Akane nor Ukyo are turning tricks but there is a fine line being walked. On the one hand, Ranma, Akane and Ukyo strip, do lap dances and generally do their whorish best to separate a man, and a few women, from their money.</p><p>I have a pretty broad definition of what constitutes a sex worker. Obviously I consider prostitutes sex workers, as well as strippers and I doubt anyone would disagree. I also include masseuses and massage therapists and, sometimes, I include manicurists, pedicurists and those women who do the bikini waxing. The point is, I could easily make a case that a sex worker is anyone who provides a service that results in some type of physical pleasure, some sensual experience.</p><p>Orgasm is optional.</p>
