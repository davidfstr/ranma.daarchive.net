</div><p>Chapter 2</p><p>"Facing the Music'</p><p>The doorbell to the Tendo home rang. Soun didn't hear it. Nodoka looked at Soun in concern as she walked over to the door. She opened it. Nodoka's face firmed. "You have a lot of explaining to do young lady." She said. "Your father is in a state."</p><p>"Nice to see you too Auntie." Nabiki replied coolly. "You remember Kimi?" She pulled the third person forward. "And Tatewaki."</p><p>"Good Morning Mrs. Saotome." Tatewaki said nervously. He extended a bouquet. "I had hopes you would be here." He said. "May we come in?"</p><p>Nodoka took the bouquet gingerly. "Gifts?" She said. "Why would you wish my presence?" She asked. She waved the trio into the vestibule.</p><p>Tatewaki took off his shoes and replaced them with slippers. "You are the closest Nabiki has to a mother." Tatewaki replied. "It would be fitting that your approval be sought as well."</p><p>"Approval?" Nodoka looked at the bouquet again. Her eyes widened. "Oh my." Nodoka sagged in relief. "Are you here to see Nabiki's father?" She asked hopefully. She smiled at Tatewaki's nod.</p><p>"Aye. If he would." Tatewaki replied. "There are some things I wish to discuss with him."</p><p>"Kimi and I are going to my room." Nabiki said. She looked at Tatewaki. "Just be direct." She instructed the Kendoist. "Daddy likes directness." Nabiki looked at Nodoka. "We'll come down when it's safe."</p><p>"Coward." Kimi said with a laugh.</p><p>Nabiki nodded rapidly. "When it comes to Daddy, oh yeah." She kissed Tatewaki on the cheek. "Be strong."</p><p>Nodoka's eyebrows rose. "I see." She murmured. "Come along Tatewaki." She told the young man. They walked into the main room. The Tendo patriarch sat on at the main table, he looked frail and drawn. A untouched cup of tea sat at his elbow. "Soun you have company." She said. "Soun." She said in a sharper voice when the older man didn't respond.</p><p>Soun looked up. "Oh." Soun said quietly.."Young man, forgive me I did not hear you come in." He waved to the low table. "Please sit."</p><p>"Thank you sir." Tatewaki replied. He sat.</p><p>"Why don't I make some fresh tea?" Nodoka suggested. "While the two of you get re-acquainted."</p><p>"Please don't go to any trouble." Tatewaki said.</p><p>"Oh no trouble." Nodoka replied cheerfully. She bustled off to the kitchen.</p><p>Soun and Tatewaki exchanged some small talk. "Sir." Tatewaki said deferentially after the niceties were observed. "I wish to speak to you about your Daughter." Tatewaki began.</p><p>"My Daughter?" Soun asked. "Akane?" He frowned when Tatewaki shook his head. "Kasumi?" Soun's expression became agitated. "I have no other daughter." He said firmly.</p><p>"Sir." Tatewaki said in repressed anger. "It is your daughter Nabiki that I speak of." He raised a hand. "I have heard the rumors. They are lies." He said firmly.</p><p>"Lies?" Soun said angrily. He pulled an envelope out of his gi and tossed in on the table. "Are these lies?"</p><p>Tatewaki opened the envelope. Inside were some pictures. Pictures of Nabiki naked and in bed with a man. Pictures of Nabiki and Kimi also naked. Some of the pictures were nearly pornographic in nature. Even though she and Kimi were wearing their wigs, if you knew Nabiki or Kimi you would be able to recognize them. "Not lies." Tatewaki admitted. "But not the truth either. Not the whole truth anyway." Tatewaki took the pictures and tore them in half. "And you do your daughter a disservice by not listening to what she has to say."</p><p>Nodoka chose that moment to return with a tea service. She noticed the torn pictures on the table. She set the tea service down, then picked up the pictures and put them in a pocket. "I will dispose of these." She said quietly. She gave Tatewaki a look of approval. Nodoka poured tea. "Why are you here young man?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"I wish permission to court Nabiki." Tatewaki replied. He swallowed nervously. "She has indicated she would be amenable but wishes her father's permission."</p><p>"You would ask even after seeing those, those," Soun's voice was raspy with unshed tears.</p><p>"I would." Tatewaki replied in a firmer voice. "Because I know Nabiki and there is much to the story you do not know." Tatewaki sighed. "It is not my place to defend her, not yet." He said. "But I would still ask even if I saw worse." He leaned forward. "And sir, if she were betrothed to me, wouldn't that do much to dispel further rumors?"</p><p>"Betrothed?" Soun and Nodoka gasped in unison.</p><p>"If she would have me." Tatewaki replied. "She has not said yes but she has deigned to give me a chance to prove myself." He bowed slightly. "Do you think a Kuno would wish to consort with a common whore?" He shook his head. "I know the story behind those images and I tell you all they do is make me respect her more."</p><p>"But, but to do," Soun tried and failed to keep the tears from flowing. "That. Surely there must have been a better way."</p><p>"Maybe there was." Tatewaki admitted. "There is still much I do not know but I know this; your daughter is honor incarnate. She is fearless as befits a daughter of the Tendo. I can only hope that I can earn favor in her eyes." He bowed again. "May I have your permission to try?"</p><p>Nodoka smiled slightly. "Well Soun?" She said. "It seems to me that young Tatewaki is sincere in his request." She gave Tatewaki another approving nod. "You're attention to the proper forms is most appreciated young man."</p><p>"Thank you madam." Tatewaki replied sincerely. He looked at the Tendo patriarch. "Sir, do I have your permission?"</p><p>"Yes. Oh yes." Soun said fervently.</p><p>"Wonderful." Enthused Nodoka. "We must celebrate." She stood. Nodoka walked away and climbed the stairs and walked to Nabiki's door. She knocked. "It's Auntie, may I come in?"</p><p>Nabiki opened the door . "Is it safe?" She asked.</p><p>"You're father has given permission." Nodoka confirmed. "Now why don't you go downstairs and greet your father properly." She looked at Kimi. "Please stay, I'd like to talk to you for a moment."</p><p>"Go ahead Nabs." Kimi said. "I think I know what Auntie wants to talk to me about." She punctuated her comment with a little push. "I'll be fine." She said. "Go." Kimi and Nodoka watched Nabiki hurry down the stairs. "I'm going to miss her." Kimi muttered.</p><p>"Oh?" Nodoka said. "Are you leaving?"</p><p>"Not yet." Kimi replied. "But I will have to eventually." She said. "She's going to marry Tatewaki sooner or later and, well I don't think it will be good for them to associate with someone like me."</p><p>Nodoka tilted her head and looked at Kimi intently. "You care that much?" She asked.</p><p>Kimi sighed. "Nabiki is the best friend I ever had." She said quietly. "I want her to be happy."</p><p>Nodoka looked at Kimi with respect. "Well if that's true any talk of you leaving is premature." She shrugged slightly. "Nabiki has had few friends. Some found her cold."</p><p>"Cold? Nabs?" Kimi laughed. "She's just picky."</p><p>"Indeed." Agreed Nodoka. "And she's always exhibited excellent instincts where people are concerned." She shook her head. "No. I want you to put the idea of leaving out of your mind right now." Nodoka said.</p><p>"Auntie you know I can't stay." Kimi said.</p><p>"I know nothing of the sort." Nodoka retorted. "Oh I may have thought so in the beginning but I was wrong." Nodoka grasped Kimi's chin with one strong hand. "You will not talk of leaving, not now." She said. "Is that understood?"</p><p>Kimi looked into Nodoka's eyes. She swallowed. "Yes Auntie." She said finally.</p><p>Nodoka released Kimi's chin. "Good." She said. "Now go downstairs and help Nabiki celebrate her betrothal." To Kimi's astonishment Nodoka hugged her then let her go. "Go." Nodoka ordered. Kimi wiped at her eyes for a second then hurried away. Nodoka followed at a slower pace. 'Maybe Genma and I should adopt her.' Nodoka thought to herself.</p><p>Nodoka returned downstairs to find Ranma, Akane and Ukyo had arrived. Ranma was in male form and dressed in black slacks and a red shirt that did nothing to hide his musculature, in fact the clothing seemed designed to enhance it. Akane wore a short skirt and red silk blouse that seemed to evoke a female version of what Ranma was wearing. Ukyo, to Nodoka's surprise, was wearing a similar outfit. The three sat at the table opposite Nabiki, Tatewaki and Kimi. "All that's missing is Kasumi, Ono and Genma." Nodoka commented cheerfully.</p><p>"Where is Pops anyway?" Asked Ranma.</p><p>"Working." Nodoka replied. "He will be here soon."</p><p>"Kasumi called." Nabiki added. "She and Ono will be here soon as well."</p><p>"Excellent." Nodoka said. "I need to check on something in the kitchen. Ranma, my son, will you join me?"</p><p>Ranma raised an eyebrow. "Sure Mom." He stood. He smiled down at Akane when she grasped his hand. He leaned down. "Tatewaki looks like he's under control." He said with a smirk.</p><p>"He'd better be." Grumbled Akane. When Ranma left with his mother Akane moved closer to Ukyo.</p><p>Ranma followed his mother into the kitchen. "What's up Mom?" He asked when the door to the kitchen closed. "I know you didn't ask me to come here to help make tea."</p><p>Nodoka extracted the torn photos from her dress and handed them to Ranma. "This." She said coldly. "Have you any idea how these pictures came to be?"</p><p>Ranma looked at the pictures. "It's not Nabiki's apartment, if that's what you're asking. Looks like a hotel room to me." He looked at his mother. "It isn't Kimi."</p><p>Nodoka nodded. "I've already decided she's innocent of any involvement." She said. "I will not have this, my son." She said angrily. "I will not have this family's name dragged through the mud. I will not have it."</p><p>"It'll be taken care of." Ranma promised grimly. "I think I know where to start looking."</p><p>"Good." Nodoka replied. "Now get out of here while I make something for us to eat."</p><p>"Sure mom." Ranma returned to the main room of the house. Ranma sat down between Akane and Ukyo. "We'll talk later." He said to their inquiring looks.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Three figures flitted across the rooftops. They had been patrolling for three nights. For the most part no one knew they were there. Those that did were beginning to dread the night. The three stopped on a rooftop. One looked down. "Oh look a criminal."<p>"How can you tell Ran-chan?" Ukyo asked cheerfully.</p><p>"I think it's the fact that he's trying to open that window with a crowbar." Akane opined.</p><p>"Well you know first appearances can be deceiving." Ukyo replied. She reached into a bag slung on her hip and pulled out something that looked like a thin braided rope. "Let's find out for sure." She spun the rope over her head a couple times and then tossed it at the figure below. The rope wrapped itself around the figure. Ukyo pulled and the man below was lifted screaming into the air. "Hello." Ukyo said.</p><p>"Let me down." Screamed the man.</p><p>"Okay." Ukyo released the rope and the man fell screaming toward the ground. The elastic noodles slowed his fall as he neared the ground and then the man rose yo-yo like back into the air.</p><p>"Next time I'll really let go." Ukyo growled.</p><p>"What do you want?" Gasped the frightened man.</p><p>"Someone is messing with a friend of mine." Ranma hissed angrily. "I want to know who."</p><p>"It's not me. It's not me." The man babbled. "I'm just a thief."</p><p>"Yeah, but even thieves hear things." Ranma replied. "For instance, who do you know who deals in blackmail?"</p><p>"Yakusa?" The man panted rapidly in fear.</p><p>"No duh." Akane rolled her eyes. "Drop'im, he knows nothing."</p><p>Ukyo grinned and made to release the rope. "Wait. Wait." Screamed the thief. "I heard something. There's a new group. At the docks. I heard, I heard they're making the old clans nervous." The man swallowed. "They say some old Chinese woman runs it."</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo exchanged looks. Ukyo pulled the man on to the roof. "Good boy." She patted him on the head. "If I were you, I'd find another line of work."</p><p>"Yeah, cause if we catch you again we won't be so nice." Akane added coldly.</p><p>To the man's surprise the three seemed to fade into the darkness. "Hey." He yelled. "You didn't untie me."</p><p>"The rope is edible." Came a laughing voice from the darkness. "I hope you're hungry."</p><p>Ranma, Akane and Ukyo raced along the rooftops. They quickly reached the docks and started looking around. "Oh crap." Ukyo exclaimed in a hiss. She pointed. "Double crap." She said a moment later. "They got guns."</p><p>"Looks like Chinese make to me." Ranma added. Akane nodded in agreement. "We saw a few while we were in China." Ranma explained. Akane nodded again. "Looks to me they're protecting that building." Ranma pointed. As he spoke a door opened and a figure was framed in the lit doorway. Ranma stared. "Let's go. I've seen enough for tonight." He ordered. The three raced away.</p><p>"That was Shampoo wasn't it?" Ukyo said. Ranma nodded.</p><p>Shampoo looked into the night but didn't see anything other than the guards. She walked back into the warehouse. "I see nothing great-grandmother. Are you sure you felt something?"</p><p>"I felt something." Cologne said firmly. She packed her pipe and puffed it alight. "Someone powerful."</p><p>"Ranma?" Shampoo asked.</p><p>"Maybe." Cologne replied. "Or Hibiki or Kanzen." She puffed on her pipe. "Or someone else." She looked at Shampoo. "Regardless, they are gone now." She pointed at Shampoo with the stem of her pipe. "Time to fetch Hikaru."</p><p>Shampoo grinned evilly. "Oh good." She said. "Bed too cold at night."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"We interrupt this broadcast for an important bulletin. There has been a breakout at the Tokyo Men's correctional facility. According to official reports, HikaruNakamura has escaped with the aid of person's unknown." A picture was flashed on the screen. "Also according to reports the people who freed Mr. Nakamura used explosives of some sort to enter and exit the building."<p>Nabiki flicked off the television impatiently. "Explosives. Hah." She snorted. "That was Shampoo's doing."</p><p>"Nabiki, the walls of the prison are over three feet thick." Kimi said in disbelief.</p><p>"So?" Nabiki replied. "I've seen her kick a hole through walls thicker than that." She looked at Kimi. "The only other person capable of doing that, other than the old ghoul, is Ryoga Hibiki and Hibiki wouldn't do that." She shook her head. "No, it was Shampoo." She picked up the telephone.</p><p>"Who are you calling?" Kimi asked.</p><p>"Ranma." Nabiki replied. "I want to make sure he knows." She gave Kimi a reassuring smile. "Then I'll ask Tatewaki to come over."</p><p>"Do me a favor." Kimi said. "Call Tatewaki first." She smiled nervously. "He's closer."</p><p>Nabiki nodded. "Good thinking." She replied. "Besides much as I love my sister, having the three of them underfoot can be a real drag." She dialed a number. "Hey Tatewaki." She said warmly. "Feel like coming over?" She smiled broadly. "Take your time, fifteen, twenty minutes will be fine." Nabiki laughed at something Tatewaki said. "See you soon baby." She purred into the telephone and hung up. Still chuckling Nabiki punched in another number. "Sis?" She said. "Oh Ukyo, did you hear?" A look of relief passed over Nabiki's face. "Good, thanks Ukyo. Give my love to my sister and Ranma." She hung up. Nabiki hesitated for a second then dialed another number.</p><p>"Who are you calling this time?' Kimi asked.</p><p>"Chikato." Nabiki replied tersely. "Lieutenant Noriudo please." Nabiki drummed her fingers on the table she was standing next to. "Lieutenant? Yeah we heard. You are? Oh good. Tatewaki is coming over. Yeah. Thanks Lieutenant." She hung up. "Chikato is assigning a squad car to watch the apartment." She informed Kimi. She walked over and sat down next to Kimi and waited.</p><p>It seemed like an eternity before the doorbell rang. Nabiki stood and walked over but stood slightly to the side. "Yes?"</p><p>"I seek a maiden fair." Came Tatewaki's voice.</p><p>Nabiki grinned in relief. She opened the door, pulled Tatewaki inside quickly and shut the door. "Right on time Tatewaki." Nabiki sighed when Tatewaki wrapped his arms around her. "Umm." She purred. She raised her face and was kissed soundly by Tatewaki.</p><p>Kimi watched indulgently as Nabiki and Tatewaki embraced. She didn't interfere for a long moment then stood. "Hey don't I get a hello kiss?" She puckered her lips.</p><p>Tatewaki looked at Nabiki. "Well, um."</p><p>"Oh kiss her already." Nabiki said cheerfully.</p><p>"It seems rather strange to kiss someone else in front of you." Tatewaki protested.</p><p>Nabiki rolled her eyes. "You've done more than that in front of me." Nabiki reminded the kendoist. "Now kiss her. If you're a good boy you'll get to do more again." She sighed. "Later." She said. Nabiki smiled as Tatewaki hesitantly kissed Kimi. The hesitation vanished quickly.</p><p>"Damn you're a good kisser." Kimi said huskily. She patted Tatewaki on the chest. "We have to talk." She said. Tatewaki found himself sitting on the couch between Nabiki and Kimi. "Hikaru broke out of prison." Kimi said.</p><p>"What?" Tatewaki exclaimed angrily. He jumped to his feet. "Get your things. You're moving, both of you, into the mansion."</p><p>"Much as we'd love to, I don't think that's a good idea." Nabiki said. "I doubt your father or your sister would approve."</p><p>Tatewaki opened his mouth to protest then closed it. He sighed. "Perhaps you're right. But I can't leave the two of you unprotected." He said.</p><p>"That is exactly why we called you." Nabiki pulled Tatewaki back down on the couch. She looked at Tatewaki. "Can you stay with us for a few days? At least until Hikaru is recaptured."</p><p>Tatewaki looked around the apartment. "I would be a fool to say no but," Tatewaki waved a hand to indicate the apartment. "Three here." He shook his head. "Would you consider getting a larger apartment?"</p><p>"This is as big an apartment as we can afford Tatewaki." Nabiki replied. She shrugged. "All our money is tied up in investments."</p><p>"Then what pays for this?" Tatewaki asked.</p><p>Kimi laughed. "Our investments." She waved her hands to indicate the apartment. "The mortgage, our food, our clothes." She grinned. "Heck we even have a medical plan."</p><p>"Give me another year and we can afford a larger apartment." Nabiki promised. "But not right now."</p><p>Tatewaki licked his lips before commenting. "I can understand if you won't tell me; but how much more do you need?"</p><p>Nabiki shrugged. "About twenty million yen." She said in a clinical tone. "That's just to be able to afford the larger place." She looked at Tatewaki. "Thinking of investing?" She asked playfully.</p><p>Tatewaki looked down at the floor. "If you wouldn't find that unacceptable." He said carefully. "If there is one thing I've learned about you Nabiki Tendo is that you earn your way." He continued to look down. "I have twenty million yen." He said quietly.</p><p>"Can you afford thirty five million?" Nabiki asked in a calculating tone. "That'll give you a one third share."</p><p>Tatewaki looked up in surprise. "You have acquired that much?" He asked in disbelief. He looked at the proud smiles on Nabiki and Kimi's face. "Remarkable." He scratched the side of his head. Tatewaki chuckled. "Aye, I can afford such an amount."</p><p>Nabiki looked at Kimi. "What do you think?"</p><p>Kimi rolled her eyes. "Oh like I'm going to turn it down." She said. "Besides that'll give us the cash to bankroll a couple deals we've had our eyes on." Kimi hugged herself. "Imagine owning my very own massage parlor."</p><p>"Excuse me." Tatewaki blinked. "When you said investments I assumed." He broke off as Nabiki and Kimi started laughing. "What?"</p><p>"We have that too Tatewaki." Nabiki said. "But we put our money to work." She shook her finger. "Let's make one thing clear, we make money." She put her hands on her hips. "Among other things, we own parts of a Pachinko parlor, a strip joint, two dry cleaners and a bar."</p><p>"We'll even loan money." Kimi added. "At a reasonable rate of course."</p><p>"Of course." Echoed Nabiki. "If it makes money, I'm all for it." She sighed at the look on Tatewaki's face. "This is what I am Tatewaki."</p><p>"Forgive me." Tatewaki said quickly. "It's just that," Tatewaki licked dry lips. "These are things I'd expect a Yakusa clan to be involved in."</p><p>Nabiki sighed again. "Not a good Japanese girl?" She looked at Tatewaki. "That's one thing I'm not Tatewaki." She raised her hand. "I'm not Tatewaki. I know that, Kimi knows that and, the gods help me if you want to be around me, you need to know that too."</p><p>Tatewaki was silent for a long moment. "Forgive me." He said again. "I offend when I only wished to praise." He looked at Nabiki and, to her surprise, took her hand. "There is much to admire about you Nabiki Tendo and I think nothing more so then your spirit." He looked into Nabiki's eyes. "You say you are not a good Japanese girl, so be it. But know this Nabiki Tendo, I would not wish you any other way."</p><p>"Same here." Kimi murmured quietly. "So, do we have a deal?" She said aloud.</p><p>"We have a deal." Tatewaki said. "Would you wish a contract or would a handshake do?"</p><p>"Oh I want a contract." Nabiki moved closer to Tatewaki. "And I'll want something more than a handshake." She smiled. "Just to close the deal."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka Saotome looked up from the grill as the bell over the door tinkled. "Konatsu." She called. "Customers." Konatsu hurried out from the back. The cross dressing martial artist went out to seat the customers. Nodoka hummed to herself as she worked the grill. Since Ukyo went to live with Ranma and Akane, Nodoka had taken over the restaurant. Every day she worked at the restaurant only deepened her respect for Ukyo Kuonji. It was hard work and it was remarkable that Ukyo had made the restaurant successful at such a young age.<p>"We really need to do something about her." Nodoka said to herself. She knew Konatsu was in love with Ukyo but it was an unrequited love. 'I'm not even sure Konatsu even knows how to function as a man.' She thought. She looked out to where Konatsu was flirting with the men at the table and shook her head.</p><p>Konatsu came back with the orders. Nodoka started cooking. The bell over the door tinkled again and Konatsu ran out. 'He may not know how to be a man but he is very good for business.' She thought. She knew there were many young men who came frequently hoping to talk to and possibly get a date with Konatsu. Several had. 'Oh to be a fly on the wall during one of those dates.' She thought in amusement. Konatsu came back with more orders. Soon Nodoka has no time to think and only time to cook. The morning passed in pleasant busyness.</p><p>The doorbell tinkled again. Konatsu ran out. Suddenly there was the sound of raised voices. Nodoka looked up from her grill. A young man was screaming at Konatsu. He was waving a couple pieces of paper that looked like photographs.</p><p>"You're a man." Screamed the customer. "A god damned faggot." The man threw the pictures in Konatsu's face. "I can't believe I kissed you." The man threw a punch at Konatsu which the martial artist evaded easily. The man continued to shout imprecations at Konatsu while trying to land a punch.</p><p>Nodoka hurried from behind the counter. "Young man." She said angrily. "There is no call for such behavior."</p><p>"No call?" The young man shot back. "No call? Do you know what you have working for you?"</p><p>"I know exactly what Konatsu is." Nodoka replied.</p><p>"And you allow this, this thing to work here where decent people eat?" He spit on the floor.</p><p>"Get out." Nodoka snarled. "Get out and never come back."</p><p>"Don't worry, I won't." The young man turned on his heel and stalked to the door. At the door he turned. "You haven't heard the last of this." He promised. The man walked out.</p><p>Nodoka turned to Konatsu. The cross dressing martial artist looked on the verge of tears. "Are you alright?" Nodoka asked in concern. Konatsu nodded jerkily. "Why don't you take a break?" Nodoka said gently. Konatsu nodded again and walked into the back. Nodoka looked around. Most the customers were busily eating their meals and didn't look up.</p><p>Nodoka noticed the pictures on the floor. She gathered them up and looked at them. They were of Konatsu naked from the waist up, making it obvious that the seemingly pretty young girl was actually a man. 'First Nabiki and now Konatsu.' She thought angrily. 'Someone is trying to cause trouble.' Nodoka put the pictures in the pocket of her apron and returned to the grill. Konatsu came from the back. He had washed his face but his face appeared puffy from tears.</p><p>"Madam Nodoka?" Konatsu said hesitantly. "I'm sorry."</p><p>"For what dear?" Nodoka replied "If anyone should apologize it would be that rude creature that just left." Nodoka walked over to Konatsu and embraced the young man. "It's alright." She said quietly.</p><p>Konatsu shook his head. "No it's not." He replied woefully. "Look at me. I'm, I'm." Konatsu broke off.</p><p>Nodoka led Konatsu over to the counter and made the young martial artist sit down. "My son told me a little about your upbringing." Nodoka fought back her anger. "It was a cruel thing they did to you." Nodoka looked at Konatsu who was looking at the ground. She reached over and gently raised the young man's face. "It's not your fault." Nodoka sighed. "You're so much like Ranma, did you know that?" She said. "Except I think my son has it easier than you."</p><p>"Ranma isn't confused." Konatsu said in disagreement. "Ranma doesn't worry about if he's a boy or a girl."</p><p>Nodoka sighed again. "Doesn't he?" Konatsu looked up in surprise. "He turns into a girl Konatsu." Nodoka continued. "I think confused is too pale a word to describe what he goes through." She said. "And yet he still has an easier time of it than you. If he has," Nodoka swallowed. "Urges, he can just become a girl." She said. "You, on the other hand, are physically, at least, a boy all the time."</p><p>"Does Ranma have urges?" Konatsu asked in a whisper.</p><p>Nodoka looked down. "If he does, he wouldn't tell me." She said sadly. "Yet I can't help but believe he struggles with himself on a regular basis." Nodoka looked at Konatsu. "And even if he does, he will always be my son."</p><p>"I wish my step-mother was like you." Konatsu said feelingly. "Then maybe I would be normal."</p><p>Nodoka laughed sadly. "Having Ranma for a son has forced me to change my idea of what is normal." She said. She leaned forward. "I wanted Ranma to be manly." She said. "Manly." Her snort was full of self derision. "Don't look to me as some ideal Konatsu." She said. "I wanted him to be manly when I should have wanted him to be happy."</p><p>Konatsu's mouth dropped open as Nodoka spoke. He swallowed several times. "Now I really wish you had been my stepmother." He said longingly. "I wish my stepmother loved me as much as you love your son."</p><p>Nodoka wiped her eyes. "Thank you Konatsu." She said.</p><p>Nabiki paced the living room of apartment. "First me, then Konatsu." She said angrily. "Me I can understand." She said. "But Konatsu?" She continued to pace. "It makes no sense."</p><p>"It only makes no sense if the pictures are related to Hitoshi." Kimi offered. "What if we are faced with some freak who just likes to take pictures."</p><p>Tatewaki and Nabiki exchanged a look. "Gosenkugi!" They chorused.</p><p>"Who or what is a Gosenkugi?" Kimi asked.</p><p>Nabiki walked over to a bookshelf and pulled out her photo album. She quickly rifled through it. She walked over to Kimi. "That is Gosenkugi."</p><p>"Eep." Squeaked Kimi. "What is it?" She asked. "Is it human?" She stared at the picture in horrified fascination. "He looks like some kind of nerd vampire."</p><p>"Don't let his looks fool you Kimi." Nabiki cautioned. "He's intelligent, resourceful and, possibly, insane."</p><p>"He's also somewhat wealthy." Kuno added. "Remember that power suit he bought?' He reminded Nabiki. "That wasn't a cheap toy."</p><p>"He used to have a crush on Akane." Nabiki said thoughtfully. "He'd take pictures of her."</p><p>"Aye." Kuno said. "To my shame I bought some of his," Tatewaki looked down shamefacedly. "He took pictures of her in the girls' locker room."</p><p>"Oh wonderful, a voyeur as well." Kimi shook her head. She looked at the picture again. "What's with the candles?"</p><p>"Gos considered himself a practitioner of the 'dark arts'." Nabiki said. "No one ever took it seriously."</p><p>"Except Gos." Tatewaki said moodily. "As Nabiki said, be not fooled by his appearance, he is a dangerous enemy in his own way." Tatewaki walked to the front door of the apartment and opened it. "Sasuke." He bellowed.</p><p>To Kimi's shock a diminutive and strange looking man seemed to appear from nothing. "Wha?"</p><p>"Sasuke." Nabiki whispered. "Tatewaki's family has Shinobi retainers." She looked at the little Ninja with suspicion. "Sasuke was, is, Tatewaki's personal Ninja."</p><p>"Master?" Sasuke bowed to Tatewaki. "How may I serve you?"</p><p>"Find Gosenkugi." Tatewaki directed. "Find him and report back to me." He said. "Now go."</p><p>"I go Master." Sasuke said in deferential tones. The little Ninja vanished.</p><p>"Nabs?" Kimi said out of the side of her mouth. "Tatewaki has a pet Ninja?"</p><p>"Yup." Nabiki replied cheerfully. "The Kuno's are an old, very old, family." She looked at Tatewaki. "One of the things I've always liked about the Kunos." She walked over to Tatewaki. "How long has Sasuke been there?" She asked.</p><p>"He is never more than a minute or two away." Tatewaki replied offhandedly. He turned his head to look at Nabiki. "Fear not, he is discrete."</p><p>"I wasn't complaining." Nabiki said calmly. "But he's not staying here."</p><p>Tatewaki snorted in amusement. "I wasn't suggesting it." He said. "Sasuke can fend for himself." He smiled slightly. "I expect he'll express some concern over me moving out of the mansion."</p><p>"He's going to have to rough it, huh?" Nabiki guessed. She smiled at Tatewaki's amused nod. "The life of a loyal retainer is fraught with hardship."</p><p>"Indeed." Tatewaki replied. "Be not concerned about Sasuke, he is amply rewarded for his loyalty. If he needs an apartment, it will be provided." Tatewaki looked around. "Speaking of apartments."</p><p>"Way ahead of you lover." Kimi said. She walked over to her desk and pulled out a folder. "I've already made some appointments."</p><p>"Excellent." Tatewaki said in approval. He reached for the folder and started looking through the listings. He nodded thoughtfully as he leafed through the papers. "I should not be surprised by your ability by now, yet I am." He looked at Kimi and smiled apologetically. "A character flaw of mine."</p><p>"You're getting better Kuno baby." Nabiki said in approval. "You're getting a lot better." She patted Tatewaki on his butt. "I don't know about the two of you but I'm getting hungry."</p><p>"Say no more." Tatewaki said. He pulled out his cell phone."French?" He asked Nabiki. "I know the matri'd at La Monde."</p><p>"You know that's where Hitoshi would take us." Chided Kimi.</p><p>"Yes." Tatewaki replied. "That's why I suggested it."</p><p>Nabiki opened her mouth in surprise. "I think we're rubbing off on you." She said in a low voice. "That's almost evil enough to be one of my ideas." Nabiki tilted her head. "Hitoshi will hear about it."</p><p>"Rubbing his nose in it, you mean." Kimi added. "I don't know lover, Hitoshi is dangerous."</p><p>"So am I." Tatewaki said coolly.</p><p>Nabiki's smile became shark-like. "And you know how much we like dangerous men." She rubbed her chin and her smile faded. "He's no slouch Tatewaki." She said in warning. "If you meet him, don't play with him."</p><p>"Play with him?" Kimi said in disbelief. "Nabs, Hitoshi can make himself appear fifty feet tall."</p><p>"That may be true." Tatewaki's smile turned cold and menacing. To Kimi's surprise a sword was suddenly in his hand. "But I know a few things myself."</p><p>"Where'd that come from?" Gasped Kimi.</p><p>"Just watch." Nabiki said back. "Show her baby." She said to Tatewaki. "But not here."</p><p>Tatewaki nodded. "The roof then." Kimi hurried over to the door and opened it. Tatewaki strode out of the apartment followed closely by Kimi and Nabiki. They ascended to the roof. Tatewaki looked around. Tatewaki started a swordsman's kata only one done at such an accelerated speed that Tatewaki left a trail of afterimages behind him as he moved. Nabiki and Kimi felt a strong wind tug at them and they had to brace themselves or risk being pulled into Tatewaki's wake. Then as quickly as he began he stopped. The afterimages seemed to snap into Tatewaki's still form though one seemed to wave at Kimi before vanishing.</p><p>"Nabs." Kimi whispered.</p><p>"Yeah Kimi."</p><p>"I'm getting that feeling again." Kimi swallowed. "Oh man, I'm going to have to change my panties."</p><p>Nabiki laughed. "I know what you mean girlfriend, I know what you mean." She turned. "Come here lover." She called to Tatewaki. He walked over. "Very nice baby." She said to Tatewaki. She jerked a thumb at Kimi. "I think Kimi is convinced." Kimi nodded rapidly. "Now about dinner." She said to Tatewaki. "I think La Monde would be...acceptable."</p><p>The limousine pulled up to the curb and the valet of La Monde hurried over to open the door. A long pair of shapely legs swung out. The body that followed was very familiar to the valet. "Miss Mari." The valet said in pleased surprise. "It's been too long."</p><p>"Hello Ken." Nabiki said in greeting.</p><p>The valet looked into the limo. A second shapely pair of legs came into view. He reached his hand in to escort the second familiar female from the limo. "Miss Suu."</p><p>"Ken." Kimi said in her pleasant alto. "Did you miss us?"</p><p>"La Monde hasn't been the same." Ken, the valet, admitted. He frowned slightly as a man exited the limo. His frown was not due to lack of recognition. The face was familiar. "Mr. Kuno." Ken said respectfully. "This is," Ken paused. "Unexpected."</p><p>"Good evening Ken." Tatewaki said in greeting. "Is something wrong?"</p><p>"No. No sir." Ken replied quickly. "It's just that," He leaned forward. "Sir those are Mr. Nakamura's women." He said in a low voice.</p><p>"Not any more." Tatewaki replied. "They've traded up." He walked over to stand between Nabiki and Kimi. The two women linked their arms through Tatewaki's. "Shall we go in ladies?"</p><p>Nabiki looked over her shoulder at Ken. "Later Ken." She said cheerfully.</p><p>The valet wiped his forehead nervously. Working at La Monde brought Ken into contact with the rich, the famous and the powerful. How they got that way was of no business to the staff at the restaurant. They were very discrete. But there were always rumors. In the case of Hitoshi Nakamura the rumors were substantiated by his arrest and subsequent escape. 'If Nakamura hears about this,' He thought nervously.</p><p>Ken hurried ahead of the trio and opened the door to the restaurant for them. They entered. A tall Caucasian walked over quickly. "Mr. Kuno. It's so good to see you again." The man said in impeccable if heavily French accented Japanese.</p><p>"Antoine." Tatewaki replied. "I believe you know my companions."</p><p>Both of the Frenchman's eyebrows rose. "Miss Mari. Miss Suu. It's been far too long." He said. "I always knew Mr. Kuno had excellent taste, I just didn't know it extended to the fair sex." Antoine bowed over both Nabiki and Kimi's hands. "Follow me. I have your table waiting." Antoine pulled out chairs for the women first and seated them before Tatewaki. "An apertif?" He asked.</p><p>"The usual Antoine." Nabiki said regally. Kimi nodded in agreement.</p><p>"And you sir?" Antoine asked in a tone that would have sounded ingratiating in another man. The Frenchman however had perfected his art and instead sounded truly interested. "The usual as well?" Tatewaki nodded. Antoine looked at Nabiki and Kimi. "May I suggest a dozen oysters as well?" He asked. "They are very fresh."</p><p>"So are you." Kimi said under her breath. She covered her mouth as she giggled. "Please Tatewaki, I so love oysters."</p><p>Tatewaki laughed. "Of course Suu." He looked at Antoine and nodded. The Frenchman hurried away. "This promises to be an interesting dinner." He said. "I've never seen Antoine so deferential."</p><p>"Yeah and Ken was practically having a heart attack." Nabiki said cheerfully. "How much do you want to bet Hitoshi hears about this within the hour?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Hikaru Nakamura slammed down the telephone. "Those fucking whores." He growled. "How dare they?"<p>"What matter Airen?" Shampoo looked up from a potion she was working on.</p><p>"Mari and Suu." He growled. "I mean Nabiki Tendo and Kimi Ota." His growl became a snarl. "How dare they fucking humiliate me like that? The two of them with another man at La Monde." He started pacing. "I'll kill them, I'll fucking kill them."</p><p>"Kill them later son-in-law." Rasped Cologne. "Right now we have work to do." She lit her pipe. "Besides, they're probably doing it on purpose." Cologne blew our some smoke. "It sounds very much like something Nabiki Tendo would think of." She pointed to a chair with the stem of her pipe. "Sit down." She barked. Hitoshi reluctantly sat down. "That's better. Not to worry son-in-law, you'll have your fun."</p><p>"I even help." Shampoo said cheerfully.</p><p>Cologne chuckled nastily. "Until then tell me how we are doing?"</p><p>Hitoshi sneered. "Saotome did me a favor with Satoh." He said. "With the old man and Kenichi out of the picture the rest of the clans are leaderless." He said. "I've already been approached by several clans." His smile was devoid of humor. "The rest will be too disorganized to resist me once I, we, make our move."</p><p>"Excellent." Cologne rubbed her hands together and cackled. "With the American's involved in that unfortunate adventure in the mid-east, Asia is now wide open." She cackled again. "Stupid Americans, there are more drugs flowing out of Afghanistan then ever before."</p><p>"And more into Japan and Korea." Hitoshi said coldly. "And as long as we keep our friends in Beijing happy."</p><p>"An important lesson Shampoo." Cologne said. "Whether they call themselves Communist or Democratic all governments have one thing in common. Those in power are so easily corrupted." She smiled coldly. "And they are weak and in this world the weak perish and only the strong survive."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Lt. Chikato Noriudo looked at the reports on his desk and frowned. "Something's going down." He said to himself moodily. "And I think Nakamura is in the middle of it."<p>Lt. Noriudo put on his coat and walked out of the police station. He got in his car and drove. His destination was, at most, fifteen minutes away but he backtracked often and took several unnecessary detours. Lt. Noriudo got out of the car and walked over to the apartment building. He nodded in appreciation. "Nice." He said. He walked into the building and into the elevator. A minute later he was knocking on the door. It opened. "Hey Kimi. "</p><p>"Hey Chikato." Kimi replied cheerfully. "Come on in." She stood aside and waved the lieutenant into the apartment. "Drink?" She asked as they entered.</p><p>"Can't." Chikato replied. "I'm on duty." He looked around. This was the first time he'd been to the new apartment. He nodded in appreciation. "Where's Nabs?"</p><p>"Taking a nap." Kimi replied.</p><p>"And Tatewaki?"</p><p>Kimi grinned. "Taking a nap too." She jerked her head toward one of the bedroom doors. "They were celebrating last night."</p><p>Lt. Noriudo raised an eyebrow. "Without you?" He asked in surprise. "I thought you and Nabs were, you know."</p><p>Kimi laughed. "We are, sorta." She said. "I love the girl Chikato but she needs a man in her life." She looked at the bedroom door. "Tatewaki is perfect for her." A soft smile came to her face. 'And I'll always be there for her if she needs me.' She thought. She walked over to the bedroom door and knocked. She opened the door. "Get up you two, Chikato is here." There was a murmured protest. "No arguments, he needs to talk to you." She closed the door. She walked back to Chikato. "Give'em a couple minutes." Kimi sat down.</p><p>It was closer to ten minutes before Nabiki and Tatewaki came out of the bedroom. "Sorry Chikato." She said as she tightened the sash of her silk robe. It was pretty obvious that was all she was wearing. Tatewaki wore a silk pajama bottom and a matching robe that he wore open, exposing his muscular chest. "I was wondering when you'd show up." Nabiki continued. She and Tatewaki sat on the couch together and next to Kimi.</p><p>"Someone's trying to take Satoh's place as head of the Yakusa clans." Lt. Noriudo said without preamble. "And by someone, I mean Nakamura." He grumbled.</p><p>"Hikaru always was ambitious." Nabiki agreed. "My sister called and reported that they've seen armed men in the warehouse district." She said. "The weapons were Chinese make."</p><p>"Crap." Chikato said angrily. "What else?"</p><p>"Nothing else at the moment." Nabiki replied. "The guys are going to look around some more and I'm keeping my ears open." She shrugged. "Not much else I can do."</p><p>"Too bad there isn't someone else to challenge Nakamura for control." Rumbled Tatewaki. "The Yakusa were relatively harmless before he showed." He looked up at Kimi's snort of amusement. "Did I say something amusing?"</p><p>"I just remembered something you said once. About how our investments were something you thought a Yakusa clan would be involved int." Kimi asked with a smile. She leaned over and placed a hand on Nabiki's shoulder. "I give you Nabiki Tendo, Oyabun."</p><p>Nabiki raised a finger in protest and held it. She put her finger down. Suddenly she started to chuckle. "Ooh, did I ever tell you how much I love smart women."</p><p>"Yeah, but you can tell me again." Kimi squeezed Nabiki's shoulder. "Later." She turned. "What do you think Chikato?" She said. "I don't think it'll take much convincing to get the Terrible Three to harass Nakamura physically, while Nabs hits them in the pocketbook." Kimi smiled coldly. "Once the other clans see that there is a challenge to Nakamura they'll sit back and wait."</p><p>"Excuse me." Tatewaki said in a confused tone. "Are you seriously suggesting Nabiki attempt to take over the Yakusa or at least prevent Nakamura becoming the head of the Yakusa? And is Nabiki considering it?" He looked at Nabiki in disbelief. "Do you seriously believe you can do this?"</p><p>"Why not?" Nabiki asked. She looked down and smiled modestly. "I've sort of been doing it all along." She nodded and then looked at Chikato. "It's a good plan Chikato." She said. "I have the connections. I have the muscle." She chuckled. "Do I ever have the muscle." She looked back at Tatewaki. "You in baby?" She asked in a purr. "Do you think the Kuno's would object to a little more money? A little more power?"</p><p>Tatewaki's eyes narrowed. "My father controls the majority of the Kuno fortune." He said. "I can only promise what is mine."</p><p>Nabiki smiled slightly. "And I can't promise I'll win baby." She said. "But I can promise you it won't be for lack of trying." She leaned toward Tatewaki. "And I can promise you the time of your life."</p><p>"It's gonna be a wild ride Lover. And we'd like you to be there with us. For us." Kimi said. She smiled. "We need a knight."</p><p>Tatewaki smiled. "Then your knight I shall be my ladies." He replied almost cheerfully. "Such opportunities are rare these days." He turned to Nabiki. "Then Lady Nabiki, let me pledge what is mine in this endeavor." His smile widened.</p><p>Nabiki leaned forward and placed her hand over Tatewaki's heart. She stared into his eyes. "This is what I want Tatewaki. Pledge me, you."</p><p>Tatewaki's smile faded and was replaced by one of some fierce unnamed emotion. "I am Samurai Nabiki Tendo." He said in a stern voice unlike anything anyone in the room had heard before. The voice of a man who spent his whole life seeking a purpose and, to his joy, found one. "Today I pledge myself to you as your Samurai. Your servant." His returning smile was somber. "And for that, I am grateful."</p><p>Nabiki turned to Chikato who had the look of a man fighting from looking astonished. And failing. "What's the matter Chikato?"</p><p>"Did I just witness a formal alliance between a Kuno and a Tendo?" He asked.</p><p>"That's what I heard." Nabiki leaned against Tatewaki and placed her hand on his thigh. "You realize I can't play nice." She said to Chikato.</p><p>"Just as long as you don't play any rougher than you have to." The lieutenant replied grimly. "I'm risking my career not arresting you right now."</p><p>"Don't worry about your career Lieutenant." Nabiki said seriously. "Losing your job is going to be the least of your worries in the near future. I'm going to have to let Hikaru know I'm here."</p><p>"I don't want to know." Chikato said moodily. "I wish this wasn't necessary but if Nakamura takes over," The lieutenant stood. "I'll expect weekly reports." He said.</p><p>End Chapter 2</p><p>Author's Notes: Fate is a strange thing. Here I am writing about Yakusa and the like and what happens? Last week I was getting a massage when several gunmen burst into the place and the next thing I know, I am tied up, on the floor and some shithead is threatening to shoot me. Obviously nothing came of it but it was unnerving. The funny thing was instead of being frightened I was angry!</p><p>They had tied us up, there were four of us, using plastic restraints, you know the one's the cops use these days. I snapped the restraints and freed everyone else. By that time the gunmen had left. But for the next three days my shoulder was wrenched and I still don't have all the feeling in my hands.</p><p>The police think I was a victim of some local Tong activity. Shee-it.</p><p>Sounds like an episode from CSI or something; doesn't it? Unfortunately it was real.</p>
