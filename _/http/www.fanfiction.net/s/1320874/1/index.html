</div>Shampoo Kills Girl-type Ranma<br/>By Ron Dow75<br/>"You're built like a stick! Your face makes me sick! Your<br/>thighs are too thick! You can't even kick! You're dumb as a<br/>brick! You act like a hick! Your hair's a cowlick! You itch<br/>like a tick!..."<p>The insults reverberated in Akane's mind, over and over<br/>again. Each time they carried the same emotional pain. Her<br/>brain's synapses discharged their electrical signals as if<br/>they were lightning bolts:<p>Zz-kzz! K-rrr! Kk-rrr! Kk-rrzzz!<p>"Oh, oh...ow-oh...oww, errr!..."<p>Finally, Akane at last knew WHO it was she found so<br/>offensive! She screamed, "Ranma, you jerk!" as she slapped<br/>him as hard as she could.<p>The blow was so hard the boy landed meters away...where he<br/>laid, groaning in pain.<p>Akane came to her sense, "Hhah! Oh!" Seeing what she'd<br/>done, she hurried over to him, "Ranma, are you all right?"<p>Akane's dad rushed over to his daughter, "Akane! It worked,<br/>you remembered Ranma!" And he stood on Ranma as he grabbed<br/>his beloved daughter by her shoulders, "Akane!"<p>Ranma yelled. Already in enough pain, he now had an adult<br/>man on his back.<p>Akane tried to come to terms with what had happened, "Dad,<br/>I..."<p>Her dad wept, "It's a miracle: A miracle of love!"<p>Ranma pleaded, "Get off me!" as he struggled to crawl out<br/>from the man who refused to think of anybody but his<br/>daughter at the moment. "G-uh! I, I can't breathe! You're<br/>crushing me to death! Urh!..."<p>Suddenly there was loud banging at the dojo wall in front<br/>of him.<p>A section of the wall was shattered to pieces. On the other<br/>side of the gaping hole was a girl without the pants, just<br/>a Chinese silk shirt that almost let you know if she was<br/>wearing panties or not. "Nihao!" she greeted them with a<br/>smile.<p>Akane said, "Shampoo!"<p>Shampoo asked cheerfully, "Is girl-type Ranma almost<br/>killed, now? Shampoo come to help!"<p>"C, c, could somebody help me...Please!"<p>The Amazon looked down and saw that under the kindling she<br/>was standing on was a body.<p>Shampoo leaped off to the side. Her hands over her mouth,<br/>she waited to see the condition of that body as it pulled<br/>itself out from under the kindling.<p>She recognized the body as being in good condition, "Wo<br/>airen!" she cried, kneeling down to be closer to him.<p>But before she could embrace him, Akane grabbed the<br/>Amazon's "husband" by his pigtail and yanked him away.<p>Angry, shampoo challenged, "What you doing?" Then she<br/>realized, "So that it. You remember Ranma again. You are<br/>stubborn girl."<p>Akane challenged back at her, "I wouldn't talk if I were<br/>you."<p>"Hmh! Too bad. If you don't remember, you don't have to<br/>die." And Shampoo immediately, quicker than any normal<br/>person could respond, attacked Akane with a deadly two<br/>finger spear hand.<p>Coming to the rescue, Ranma snatched Shampoo's fingers and<br/>held on. "Stop it Shampoo!"<p>Shampoo became instantly heated. Smiling, she caressed his<br/>cheek, "Wo airen!" It was not enough, she threw her around<br/>his shoulders.<p>Akane couldn't take any more the disgusting display,<br/>"Grr...Rarh! Stop DOING that!" she cried, smashing her<br/>elbow into and down on Ranma's face.<p>Ranma used his natural strength to resist Akane's effort to<br/>push him to the floor to raise his head enough to ask<br/>Shampoo, "J, just, don't, hurt Akane, OKAY?"<p>Shampoo was insulted, "Why not? Is obstacle. That is for<br/>killing."<p>Ranma yanked himself out from under Akane's power, "Hrrh!"<br/>He faced up to Shampoo. "I guess I have no choice. I'll<br/>have to tell the truth."<p>/<p>Ranma lead the two girls, two fathers and Ryoga to the<br/>Tendo garden. Picking up a pail, he stood beside the koi<br/>pond. He filled the pail.<p>Sitting on the porch, Akane said, "Ranma are you sure you<br/>want to do that now? She'll only go after you again, you<br/>know."<p>But Ranma gathered up his courage, "Okay, watch this,<br/>Shampoo." He upended the pail, letting the water fall over<br/>him.<p>Shampoo stared, confused. Her airen was gone. Standing<br/>where he should have been was, "Girl-type, Ranma."<p>Ranma-chan put her hands up near her neck, "Right. I've,<br/>tried to keep it a secret." She started unbuttoning her<br/>shirt, "But that boy-stuff is just a disguise. The truth<br/>is I've been a girl all along." And she showed the boobs<br/>that proved she WAS a fully developed girl.<p>(Ryoga sagged from the doorjamb he was leaning again.<p>(While Soun Tendo's long hair nearly stood on up.<br/>"Saotome! Is this true!"<p>(The panda he was trying to strangle held up a sign, [Oh,<br/>come on, now.])<p>Ranma-chan explained to Shampoo, "So you see, you and me,<br/>we could never, uh-" She realized nothing more could be<br/>said, "Uh, oh!"<p>Shampoo looked to be seething with rage. Suddenly, she<br/>attacked. Ranma-chan just barely dodged the blow from her<br/>lethal bonbori/shui. "I kill you!" She used her lethal<br/>bonbori to try to. "Kill!" Ranma retreated backwards.<br/>"Kill!" Shampoo advanced and almost got Girl-type Ranma.<br/>Kill!" Her swings and thrusts came faster, more furious,<br/>and ALL were aimed at the redhead's head; it took all of<br/>Ranma's speed and skill to keep her cute face from being<br/>bashed. All the while all Ranma could do was retreat.<p>Then Ranma tripped over a stone embedded in the lawn.<p>Shampoo raised her bonbori for the fatal blow, "I kill<br/>you!"<p>Ranma sat cowering, her hand up in front of her face,<br/>whimpering like a girl, expecting to die in the next<br/>moment.<p>That moment didn't come. The pigtailed girl looked up.<br/>"Hunh?"<p>Shampoo was weeping.<p>She lowered her eyes and head. The tears would not stop.<br/>She could not kill. "Bi lara" Defeated, she ran off,<br/>leaping over the wall and disappearing into the night.<p>Ranma rose and stared. She said sadly, "Shampoo."<p>/<p>Nabiki was reading from her Chinese phrase book to Ranma-<br/>chan and Akane, sitting at either side of her at the family<br/>table, "Hmm. Here it is. "Bi lara"; it means sayonara,<br/>farewell, we'll never meet again, that sort of thing."<p>Drinking a cup of tea, Akane asked, as if to encourage<br/>Ranma, "You're not going after her? I BET you could still<br/>catch her."<p>Ranma-chan sat slumped morosely away from the two, her<br/>elbow on the table, her head on her hand, "Lemme alone."<p>Akane taunted her, "She SURE was cute, Ranma! I bet you're<br/>sorry you turned her down!"<p>Ranma-chan responded. She put her fist down on the table,<br/>and turned to yell, "She was tryin' to kill me! I'm glad<br/>she's gone!"<p>Akane returned to her familiar frowning self, "Then why do<br/>you look like you're going to cry, hunh?"<p>(That was it for Nabiki. She saw where this was heading;<br/>she closed the book and left.)<p>Ranma-chan told her, "Akane, you're SO uncute!"<p>Akane told Ranma back, stamping a foot, "So I'm not cute:<br/>Big deal! You're cares if I'm built like a stick or my<br/>thighs are too thick, or I can't kick!"<p>That ticked Ranma off. Putting her hands behind her head,<br/>in a show of casualness that her face did NOT show, "If<br/>knew you were gonna be like this, I would've got your<br/>memory back!"<p>That got to her, for she turned away, "I wish you didn't! I<br/>wish I never knew you existed!"<p>Ranma-chan now COULD act casual; she had won, "Oh! Oh,<br/>yeah?"<p>"Yeah!" and slammed the tea dispenser smack across her<br/>face.<p>Even when Ranma won an argument. "Nnh! Nh! You're so<br/>uncute, ow-nh, nh!"<p>Akane left the room, terribly hurt but still unbowed.<p>/<p>Later that night, the Tendo's guestroom window slid open.<br/>And Shampoo ducked through into the darkened room. She was<br/>no longer without her pants. That girl was gone.<p>She saw the panda and the boy-type Ranma sleeping on their<br/>futons on the mat floor. She stepped casually down from the<br/>window box. Remembering last night, she knew she did not<br/>have to be too quiet. No, last night they had not been too<br/>quiet.<p>She stepped around the sleeping animal, and down looked at<br/>the one who was in guys' underwear. "You think Shampoo<br/>fool." She HAD slept with him, last night. And she had done<br/>MORE than just cuddle with the boy-type Ranma, despite his<br/>attempts to fend her off without waking the rest of the<br/>house. She had an Amazon shampoo that had made him more<br/>cooperative. But Amazon honor also required her to erase<br/>his memory of their prenuptial making out. "But SHAMPOO<br/>remember." She brought out her bottle of Shampoo Formula<br/>110 and the part of the process she had left out of the<br/>treatment she gave Akane, the conditioner.<p>She knelt down next to Ranma's black pigtailed head with<br/>the items. As she began she said, "Shampoo tell girl-type<br/>Ranma bi lara, boy-type Ranma. Shampoo mean it."<p>/<p>The not-quite-awake-yet Nabiki barely acknowledged that<br/>Akane had come into the family room, while her dad smiled<br/>cheerfully, "Good morning, Akane."<p>"Hrh! What's good about it." From garden outside her ears<br/>were greeted by the all too familiar morning sounds of<br/>Ranma and his father having a workout. Over the koi pond.<p>Splash! Gritting her teeth, Akane waited for it: The worse<br/>sound to start her day with.<p>The soprano cried, "You think that's funny!" There, that<br/>was it: The voice that gave her nightmares.<p>Genma Saotome laughed, "Ha, ha! Of course it's funny! After<br/>all, didn't you think it's funny the way you used a little<br/>water to get rid of Shampoo?"<p>After a brief pause, Ranma-chan grumbled, "You always use<br/>water to get rid of shampoo." She got out of the pond and<br/>headed for the house, "I don't like gettin' wet. I'm gonna<br/>breakfast."<p>Mr. Saotome beat his son the girl to the table.<p>Akane's dad said, "This is different, Saotome. You and not<br/>the panda is eating with us, today."<p>While the two men bantered, Ranma-chan plopped down near<br/>Akane. Akane forced herself not to react too much. She was<br/>still upset over Shampoo. A part of Ranma had actually<br/>seemed to want the Amazon to stay. The part that liked<br/>brazen bimbos, no doubt.<p>Ranma-chan was also frowning, looking down at her still<br/>moving chest. She was squirming and just looking<br/>uncomfortable, and she didn't look as if she had a good<br/>night's sleep.<p>Akane accused, "I see you MISS sleeping with a cute girl<br/>like Shampoo!"<p>Ranma-chan glared at her, then tried to look casual, "I<br/>miss having a CUTE girl around."<p>Nabiki said, "I'll pretend I didn't hear that."<p>Ranma-chan put her hands up behind her head, "Yes, it'd be<br/>nice if I had somebody cute I could look at in the<br/>morning." She frowned as she moved her shoulders, then<br/>jiggled her chest.<p>Akane saw it as the buxom redhead equating cuteness with<br/>bust size. "At least you don't HAVE to look at me for very<br/>long. I'm "built like a stick", remember?"<p>Ranma-chan laid a fist on the table while grasping one of<br/>her thighs, "Is that what this is about! You're jealous<br/>just 'cuz you don't have a big chest, too?" Like<br/>Shampoo's.<p>Akane nearly exploded at that insult, "I'm not JEALOUS of<br/>your-" She suddenly stopped herself. She had nearly done<br/>the unthinkable. She'd nearly crossed the line and said<br/>something about Ranma's femaleness. She didn't do things<br/>like that. That's why she'd sworn never to get too mad at<br/>Ranma when he was in this condition.<p>Leaning forward, Ranma-chan's fist hit the table, "I<br/>already told you: Shampoo ain't mine. Just 'cuz she DOES<br/>have a large-!" She'd swung her boobs around as she<br/>confronted Akane and knocked one of them against the bowl<br/>of hot, sweetened rice. "Oh, man!" she said, pulling it<br/>away.<p>Nabiki commented, "With all the talk about boobies, I<br/>thought you'd be paying more attention to what you were<br/>doing with yours."<p>Ranma-chan had straightened up, ignoring the stain and<br/>sensations, "Guys don't have boobs."<p>Ranma was serious. "Oh?" Nabiki got up on her knees and<br/>poiked a finger against one, right where a nipple was. Here<br/>was something to help wake herself up. "Guys don't. But<br/>what do you call this?"<p>Akane warned, "Nabiki..."<p>Kk-rrzz! went Ranma's brain cells as they misfired. Ranma-<br/>chan winced, but said, "That's my chest."<p>She poiked the other one. "Plural? Guys don't talk about<br/>"chests"."<p>Akane cried, "Nabiki!"<p>K-k-rr! But Ranma-chan insisted, "I don't know what you're<br/>talkin' about."<p>"Ranma DOESN'T know she has boobs." And to prove it, Nabiki<br/>squeezed one of the redhead's. Ranma-chan was obviously<br/>feeling a charge as her brain was filled with electricity<br/>that was going nowhere but a loop.<p>The two fathers were looking now. But their attention was<br/>on the unfocused expression on Ranma's face It was all too<br/>familiar. Soun Tendo said with alarm, "Ranma's memory has<br/>been stolen, just like my poor Akane's was yesterday!"<p>Ranma's father nodded, "Just the same."<p>Akane cried, "WHAT?" She immediately slapped Ranma hard,<br/>nearly knocking the redhead over.<p>Nabiki, however, was still holding onto a boob. Ranma<br/>snapped out of it to grab her wrist. The pigtailed girl<br/>pried her fingers away from her chest. "Do you mind? That<br/>hurts."<p>Taking her hand away, Nabiki asked, "WHY does it hurt? It<br/>couldn't hurt like that if you were a guy."<p>Ranma-chan was insulted, "I AM a guy: All, one-hundred<br/>percent, guy!"<p>Nabiki's father told her, "Nabiki! Don't torment the lad.<br/>The shiatsu treatment Shampoo gave Ranma makes him<br/>incapable to remembering he changes into a girl. As soon as<br/>he remembers, he forgets."<p>Leaning over the table by her elbows, Nabiki looked at him,<br/>"Oh? As I recall, Akane was similarly incapable of<br/>remembering Ranma. How did you get her to remember?"<p>Her father cried, "Of course! For Ranma to remember, he<br/>must be FORCED to confront that which he wishes he did not<br/>have to think about!"<p>Ranma's father stood up. "Snap out of it, boy-I mean,<br/>GIRL!" he ordered, lifting the small girl up by the Chinese<br/>shirt front-And ripping it open.<p>(Kasumi chose that moment to enter, "Oh, my!")<p>Zz-Kzz! K-rrr! "Now look what you done! This is my<br/>favorite shirt!" Ranma-chan yelled. It was the sleeveless<br/>red shirt that showed off Ranma's arm muscles. Kneeing the<br/>Old Man solidly in his solar plexus, she then kicked him<br/>away while making sure his hands had loosened their hold on<br/>her shirt. Her pop landed just short of the paper wall<br/>behind Mr. Tendo.<p>As she lit gracefully on her bare feet, Mr. Tendo cried,<br/>"Forgive me, Ranma..."<p>Akane cried, "DAD!"<p>Embarrassed, Soun Tendo stopped himself just as he was<br/>about to pull down the girl's pants.<p>He looked up to apologize. Still fuming, Ranma-chan rammed<br/>her elbow against the man's thick skull. As he went down,<br/>so did Ranma's pants and underpants.<p>(Kasumi cried, "Father!" running to him.)<p>Ranma hurried to hike up both pants. "What got into<br/>them! They can see girls are here!"<p>Nabiki told her, "Ranma, take a good look at that body.<br/>Can't you see ANYTHING different about it?"<p>Ranma-chan retied the sash that held her baggy pants up,<br/>"And what are you doin' takin' a good look at it? I STOPPED<br/>runnin' around in my underwear, so you can stop-"<p>Nabiki got up on one knee and pointed, "I dare you-I<br/>CHALLENGE you to grab hold of those puppies and tell me<br/>you're "one hundred percent guy"!"<p>Ranma-chan had backed away to let Kasumi reach her father.<br/>"That's sick! I ain't provin' I'm a guy by grabbin' your<br/>sister's chest!"<p>Even Nabiki nearly had to facefault at that.<p>Down on her knees, Kasumi turned red, "Oh, my!"<p>Nabiki yelled, "Not hers, YOURS!"<p>Ranma-chan yelled back, "How can I grab something I ain't<br/>got!" All the while the open shirt was letting her<br/>advertisements flash.<p>Nabiki sat back down, and, elbow on the table, held her jaw<br/>up by her hand. "This is getting too frustrating for me.<br/>I've done all I'm willing to do. Akane? Why don't you go<br/>over there and fondle Ranma's boobs, pinch her nipples, or<br/>something."<p>"ME! Why me?"<p>"You ARE the one engaged to them."<p>Tending her father, Kasumi asked, "Could you just do it<br/>some place more private, Akane?"<p>Akane screamed, "I'm not touching anything that SHOULDN'T<br/>be there in the first place!"<p>Her dad raised his head above the table, "Please, Akane! Do<br/>it for your father!"<p>Mr. Saotome had somehow gotten over to her other side, "Do<br/>it for Ranma! You fiancé!"<p>Akane stood up, "I'm going to school!" And as she stepped<br/>over Mr. Saotome, she said to the others, "Perhaps I'll be<br/>early for a change."<p>Ranma-chan called, "I'm gettin' out of this mad house,<br/>too!" And she would have leaped in front of Akane and<br/>joined her, if Mr. Tendo and her pop weren't back to trying<br/>to strip her.<p>"Oh, my!"<p>/<p>Akane put her hand on her stomach as it growled again. "Oh,<br/>great! I left without finishing my breakfast. Just what I<br/>need to feel even better."<p>"Akane! Akane wait up!" Ranma-chan called.<p>Now not just Akane's stomach growled. "Ranma! How could you<br/>leave the house without getting hot-Wha?" When she pivoted<br/>around to look at the redhead running the walls, she saw:<br/>"Ranma! What are you doing with your shirt like that!"<p>Ranma was running so fast, the sleeveless red shirt flagged<br/>out in back of her, leaving only her shoulders covered!<br/>"Pop and your father ruined it with their stupid<br/>roughhousing!" She then jumped down onto the street in<br/>front of her.<p>Akane stared in disbelief. Ranma's bare boobs jounced and<br/>wobbled, but not as much as they SHOULD have: They were<br/>ridiculously firm, standing high on the chest. But then,<br/>she REMINDED herself, Ranma wasn't a real-<p>Ranma-chan's pants fell down. The white sash had finally<br/>torn through with the last activity. In only her boxers,<br/>she frowned, "I guess my shirt wasn't the only thing that<br/>got ruined."<p>Akane pulled up Ranma's pants, "Haven't you ANY modesty!"<p>Ranma-chan took hold of the pants' top, "Okay! I learned I<br/>should be more careful when I'm in a house with girls, but,<br/>REALLY, what's the big deal? Boxers look like bathing<br/>trunks. Geez! On Japanese TV you see guys in loincloths for<br/>underwear."<p>Akane was shaken. There was not ONE thought about anything<br/>above the waist. Teetering back, she said, "You, you really<br/>DON'T know!"<p>"Know WHAT!" Ranma said with no little irritation.<p>Akane grabbed her hand, "Come on! We're going to see Dr.<br/>Tofu!"<p>/<p>Her other hand keeping Ranma-chan's shirt closed, Akane<br/>pulled Ranma past the scandalized old lady and her smiling<br/>(for a while, "Ow!") husband and into the office.<p>Akane remembered what had happened with the Doctor<br/>yesterday. She still had something of a problem<br/>UNDERSTANDING what exactly had happened. After all, to her<br/>a strange boy had abducted and taken her to HER doctor; and<br/>the one man she thought she could count on hadn't done a<br/>thing to help her! (Except to tear up an ancient book<br/>later, at her home.) He even took sides with the stranger!<br/>She now knew that stranger was Ranma, but she also had<br/>memories of when she didn't know that.<p>While they waited, Akane used the hot water dispenser Dr.<br/>Tofu had to make tea with to change Ranma back to his true<br/>body. Now it didn't matter if his chest was exposed.<br/>Well...it almost didn't matter to her.<p>Ranma asked, "Why'd you squirt water on me? That was HOT,<br/>you know, Akane!"<p>Akane frowned at the boy, "It COULD'VE been worse: Don't<br/>you remember all of the times you had hot and COLD water<br/>splashed on you! Don't you remember Jusenkyo?"<p>Ranma used a towel to dab his chest dry. The Tendos had<br/>something against male chests today. "Of course I remember<br/>Jusenkyo! How could I forget the place that turned Pop into<br/>a panda?"<p>"And what about you! What did YOU get changed into?"<p>Z-K-rr! Kk-rrr! Krr-Krrrzz!<p>Akane grabbed Ranma by the front of his shirt, "Answer<br/>me!"<p>Rather than have his brain fried, Ranma said, "If I got<br/>pushed into any of those accursed spring it'd be-The<br/>Spring of Drowned Young MAN!"<p>Akane shook Ranma violently, "No! That's why you want to<br/>RETURN to Jusenkyo!"<p>Ranma broke away, "Why would I WANT to return to that<br/>place! I'm not gonna take the risk again! Pop can go<br/>alone! But there are worse things than bein' a giant<br/>animal."<p>Akane stopped frowning. "You, you really don't like being a<br/>girl THAT much?"<p>"What a stupid question! I like bein' what I was BORN to<br/>be: A human guy!" he said, hitching up his pants higher.<p>Dr. Tofu entered, "Ah! Akane! And who is this stranger with<br/>you?"<p>Akane told him, "Dr. Tofu, I have my memory of Ranma back!<br/>It's RANMA'S memory that's the problem!"<p>The man in the black do-gi adjusted his glasses, noting<br/>Ranma's appearance. "Oh? Did he forget how to dress?"<p>Ranma told him, "The way I look is Pop's fault! He and Mr.<br/>Tendo attacked me!"<p>Dr. Tofu said, "So, THEY are the ones who have forgotten<br/>you, now."<p>Akane told him, "Ranma forgot he can become a girl!"<p>Ranma told him, "I DON'T become a girl! That's the<br/>stupidest thing ever! Do I LOOK like a girl!"<p>Dr. Tofu said, "I see what you mean, Akane. This IS<br/>serious. Not knowing when he is female puts Ranma at a<br/>severe disadvantage. Not only does it leave him vulnerable<br/>to all sorts of assaults, his lack of common female<br/>sensibilities will assault those who might otherwise be<br/>sympathetic to being on his side!"<p>Akane put her hand close to her mouth, "Oh, no! I hadn't<br/>thought of that!"<p>Ranma screamed, "I AIN'T a girl! Why has everybody saying<br/>I am!"<p>Dr. Tofu said, "You see? Ranma's weak point IS his blind<br/>spot."<p>Ranma backed away warily from him as he moved closer, "What<br/>are you doin!"<p>The doctor headed for one a cabinet, "I'm getting some<br/>safety pins. I COULD sew up your shirt, but that would make<br/>you late for school. You don't want to miss school. A<br/>doctor knows that a good education-"<p>Ranma backed towards the door, "You sure you're not gonna<br/>do anything funny? You ARE an acupuncturist. How do I know<br/>you're not gonna stick me with them. I know acupuncture's<br/>related to shiatsu. And those techniques can do all sorts<br/>of weird stuff..."<p>The safety pins in hand, Dr. Tofu said, "Ranma, you're<br/>becoming paranoid."<p>"Oh, like I ain't got a reason to? You all want me to think<br/>I'm a girl. -I'm a GUY!" and he fled.<p>Akane cried, "RANMA!"<p>Dr. Tofu went to her, "It's not his fault, Akane. The<br/>strain to deny the obvious has loosened his grip on<br/>reality. To mix a metaphor." He handed her the safety pins,<br/>"You're going to need these."<p>Worry on her face, she said, "Thank you, Dr. Tofu."<br/>Suddenly she became determined; she opened her schoolbag,<br/>"Safety pins might not be enough! I have to be prepared for<br/>any situation!"<p>/<p>Most Japanese used clothes poles, but Ranma found a<br/>backyard that had a clothesline. After Ranma snapped one<br/>off to use as a makeshift belt they probably WOULD change<br/>to clothes poles. Ranma really didn't like stealing. But he<br/>knew he couldn't go around holding up his pants all day. HE<br/>also picked up some of the clothespins.<p>But he decided keeping his shirt closed with clothespins<br/>looked just too stupid. Instead, he just tucked in his<br/>shirt in his pants and closed it up the best he could. He<br/>decided it wasn't too bad. After all he'd spent most of his<br/>life in a do-gi, not regular clothes, and those left most<br/>of his chest exposed.<p>Of course, it didn't meet the school dress code, but, then,<br/>any student not wearing the school uniform didn't meet the<br/>dress code.<p>"I've been wearin' Chinese clothes for nearly two months.<br/>So what's a little manly chest peekin' out? It can't be no<br/>big deal."<p>Kk-rr! Z-K-rrz!<p>/<p>Taking the wall and rooftop express, Ranma got to school<br/>ahead of Akane.<p>In fact, Akane was late, and had to spend homeroom time out<br/>in the hall holding a bucket full of water. That she was<br/>kept from Ranma by her nemesis, water, wasn't lost on her.<p>Inside, Ranma had to field questions from the class. Mostly<br/>the girls. "Yeah, something happened to my clothes...I<br/>don't have too many...I have to keep room for the other<br/>stuff in my traveling pack...In fact, when I can, I wear<br/>only my kempo-gi. That's what we use to practice martial<br/>arts in. It can take a beatin' better than regular<br/>clothes...No, I don't know off hand WHY I no longer wear<br/>it...Yeah, you're right. It shows my chest like this shirt<br/>does. And no buttons, too...Now that you mention it, it<br/>does feel more normal to me to wear an open shirt...<p>"-You want to see my butt?"<p>Hiroshi explained to him, "All the surveys say girls are<br/>more interested in a guy's butt than his chest or muscles."<p>Ranma looked around at the girls, "Then why are they<br/>looking at my chest and muscles?"<p>Daisuke frowned, "It's the law of supply and demand. You're<br/>the only one with a supply. There's no demand for the rest<br/>of us, because WE'RE not allowed to show off our bodies."<p>Ranma closed his shirt with a fist, "I guess you're right.<br/>I don't remember the girls payin' me this much attention<br/>before." The only ones that were attracted to him were all<br/>violent. Maybe it was true what they said, violence creates<br/>violence. Geez! What did that say about the children they'd<br/>create.<p>/<p>Akane was allowed back in class just as the first period<br/>was about to begin. The teacher told her, "Miss Tendo. Go<br/>to your seat and stay there. You can visit the other<br/>students BETWEEN periods."<p>Akane angrily sat down at her desk-seat. But she found it<br/>hard to concentrate on anything but Ranma. She kept<br/>glancing over her shoulder at him.<p>Z—K-rr! After giving up on trying to figure out WHY Akane<br/>would be constantly looking over at him (she normally did<br/>her best to AVOID looking at him), Ranma kept his eyes from<br/>looking her away.<p>He also had a hard time looking at the teacher. Or any<br/>school teacher. Ranma hated having to sit still. His whole<br/>life had been dedicated by his pop to be a man of action.<br/>The only teachers he could pay close attention to were<br/>martial arts sensei. Even his Old Man.<p>He had to have someplace to look at. He looked at the wall<br/>with the windows looking out to the hall in it. He wondered<br/>what had happened to the holes Shampoo had made in it,<br/>yesterday.<p>-A metal pail broke through one of those windows. It<br/>sailed over the heads of the other students. Ranma stood<br/>up, ready to protect others, his senses telling him that:<br/>"Hunh? There's just water in it."<p>Splash!<p>"Not again!" The redhead licked her lips. "I recognize this<br/>water. I've tasted it often enough. It's from the Tendo<br/>fish pond."<p>Akane was the first to recover from the class interruption,<br/>"Shampoo! It HAS to be her!" And she raced for the door.<p>The teacher cried, "Miss TENDO!"<p>Ranma-chan cried, "Akane! Give it up! There's no way a<br/>slowpoke like you can beat somebody like Shampoo!" Deja<br/>vu.<p>The teacher attention was drawn to the new girl, "Who are<br/>YOU, Miss? What are you doing in this class?"<p>/<p>Akane stopped on the other side of the door. The outside<br/>window across the hall from the inside window was broken as<br/>well. Shampoo was no where to be seen outside. Akane<br/>glowered, "Rrh! Why wouldn't Shampoo deliver her "message"<br/>personally? What is she WAITING for!"<p>Suddenly, Akane knew! She spun around in alarm, "Ranma!"<p>/<p>... "Then, what's your phone number?"/ "What's you blood<br/>type!"/ "Were you born in the year of the dog?"/ "What<br/>do you like better, candy or flowers?"/ "What size are<br/>those -Ow!"/ "Idiot! She doesn't seem to know, yet!"/<p>Hiroshi was the closest of the boys crowding around the<br/>girl with the open shirt, "Hello! My name is Hiroshi!"<p>Ranma-chan said, "I already know that, Hiroshi."<p>Daisuke pushed his best friend aside, "Do you know my name<br/>is Daisuke? My family's rich."<p>Ranma-chan said, "You're not rich, Daisuke."<p>With other guys pushing against him from behind, Daisuke<br/>practically pleaded, "You're not the kind that only dates<br/>rich or handsome guys, are you?"<p>Hiroshi, struggling to keep his place, too, announced,<br/>"Daisuke, don't push too hard: Can't you see she's paying<br/>US the most attention?"<p>Ranma-chan was confused, "This is one of you guys' stupid<br/>plans to get dates?" ...<p>... Sayuri and the girls who hadn't had time to get out of<br/>their seats had to push against the backs of the boys in<br/>front of them to keep from some room between them and<br/>themselves. While she was doing that, she thought out loud,<br/>"Rich...rich...There's something about somebody rich..."<p>... The boys who were trying to chat the redhead up where<br/>staring at her daring cleavage; while those that were<br/>silent were the one's ogling the most intently.<p>Ranma-chan was feeling hemmed in and trapped; but Ranma's<br/>her martial arts conditioning was not to do anything rash<br/>against ordinary people, "What's with you guys! You're<br/>actin' worse than the girls were!"<p>... /Are those real?"/ "Stupid, don't they LOOK real?"/<br/>"Do we dare find out?"/ "A little louder. Maybe your<br/>girlfriend DIDN'T hear."/ "Oh, man, oh, I can just see<br/>one of her nipples! Move, and I can see the other one!"/<br/>"Are they hard? Does she get off on being an<br/>exhibitionist?"/ "That's not how you tell. You tell by<br/>how flushed she's getting."/ "Well, she IS getting red."/<p>Meanwhile the teacher had given up calling for the students<br/>to sit down and come to order from the front of the room.<br/>He was now trying to wedge his way in among them to get the<br/>center of the disturbance, "Miss! Miss! I must ask you to<br/>LEAVE!"<p>... /Look at those stupid boys!"/ "Like moths to a<br/>flame."/ "I hope they get burned!"/ "They'd only come<br/>back to the hottie."/ "Talk about supply and demand.<br/>Supply some flesh, and they'll demand more."/ "I know *I*<br/>would never do anything so demeaning."/ "Oh, come now! I<br/>see the way you dress out of school!"/ "There's<br/>suggesting you would, and delivering!"/ ...<p>The teacher shoved, and two boys moved unexpectedly. The<br/>teacher's hand fell against something he hadn't intended to<br/>touch.<p>Having his chest pushed against accidentally would have<br/>meant little to the male Ranma, and sometimes even to the<br/>female Ranma. But when that chest got a reaction that was<br/>too un-guy-like to ignore but was conditioned to ignore...<p>K-rrrzf! Zz-Kzzf! Kzack! The red-haired size D suddenly got<br/>a blank stare.<p>"Look at her! What'd you do to her, Teacher!"/ "I, I<br/>touched her-Accidentally."/ "You mean, like, her,<br/>tits?"/ "I was trying to get through this crowd! Then<br/>my..."/ "Whoa! This is what happens when she gets<br/>touched?"/ "She doesn't fight you?"/ "She doesn't slap<br/>you?"/ "She doesn't even scream?"<p>Akane cried, "Well, I'M screaming! -And I'm fighting!"<br/>After shouting out Ranma's name, she had waited, afraid<br/>getting involved WOULD accidentally reveal the pigtailed<br/>girl's identity. But, now, she pulled, shoved, stepped on<br/>their insteps, and propelled a third of them, including the<br/>teacher, to the far sides of the room. She hadn't done<br/>anything like this since the Hentai Horde had stopped<br/>attacking her! Only her own martial arts conditioning kept<br/>her from really harming them.<p>The girls applauded, and cheered.<p>All but one, that is: Ranma had come out of it, "Akane!<br/>Why'd you do that for?" She made no effort to cover her<br/>completely exposed boy-magnets.<p>"She really IS a slut!" the girls said and the boys<br/>groaned.<p>Akane was momentarily frozen. This WAS her nightmare. Guilt<br/>by association. If they knew she was engaged to a, a...<p>-Engaged! There was a solution: Akane could tell everybody<br/>this girl was like Shampoo—And like Kodachi! Everybody KNEW<br/>how crazy those two 'fiancées' were! She could tell them<br/>the redhead was the craziest one yet! The pigtailed girl<br/>wanted to be "Mrs. Ranma Saotome" so badly she had started<br/>identifying herself WITH Ranma! Everybody heard how she<br/>used his name at the Martial Arts Rhythmic Gymnastics<br/>Tournament.<p>Akane only had one problem with that. She had mental<br/>barriers against even pretending Ranma was a girl.<p>Her shirttails out, now, and the shirt hanging completely<br/>open, Ranma-chan confronted her, "Akane! Look what your<br/>violent temper's done! You say you hate boys-But now<br/>they're sayin' you beat up guys because you won't admit you<br/>really WANT them!"<p>"WHAT! They're talking about you!"<p>"You're crazy! Everybody can see I ain't interested in<br/>guys!"<p>There was a collective gasp, followed by a number saying,<br/>"Oh, ho!"<p>Akane shook her head violently, and waved off the<br/>suggestion fiercely with her arms, whirling this way and<br/>that to tell them, "Oh-errrhh! No! It's not like that!<br/>It's not what you think! Honestly!"<p>Ranma-chan said in a loud voice that managed to raise about<br/>hers, "I don't know what beyond stupid battle scenario you<br/>and the others got cooked up, but nobody's gonna believe<br/>you, Akane! There's NO WAY I'm interested in guys! I'm<br/>hardly interested in a tomboy like you!"<p>"Aaa-EEEyaaarrh!" Akane raced for the exits.<p>/<p>Akane didn't stop until she was outside by the walk to the<br/>school's main entrance. She had to lean up against a tree<br/>while she got her breath back. After that, she did not know<br/>what she would do. Her life might as well be over.<p>There was the sound of metal hitting away at concrete. It<br/>was coming from behind the wall near the school gate. After<br/>about five solid wrecking ball strikes, the wall cracked<br/>and crumbled. The lavender haired Amazon and her bonbori<br/>were on the other side. She had on pants, this time, no<br/>longer in just the 'micro-dress' of just her silk shirt.<p>Akane glared with hatred at her, "Shampoo."<p>Shampoo stepped over the rubble towards her. She pointed<br/>towards her with one of her balls on a stick, "You<br/>surrender Ranma, now?"<p>"WHAT! You still want Ranma? After ruining his life!"<p>"Shampoo only ruin Ranma old life. Ranma have NEW life-<br/>with Shampoo!"<p>Akane stomped towards her, "What makes you think Ranma WILL<br/>come with you?"<p>Shampoo giggled, "Everybody act strange round Ranma.<br/>Shampoo only one treat Ranma like real man." And just<br/>thinking about treating Ranma like a real man made Shampoo<br/>flush, "Ai-Yahh!..."<p>Akane stopped just short of the weapon. "And I bet you'll<br/>make sure nobody WILL treat Ranma like a man!"<p>Shampoo smiled craftily, "Hm, mh! More boy-type Ranma is<br/>treated like girl-type, more Ranma wish kill girl-type<br/>dead. Only place where girl-type stay dead in Amazon<br/>village of Shampoo."<p>Akane challenged, "You think you've got it all figured<br/>out!"<p>Shampoo quirked a scornful smile, "What Akane do about it?<br/>Admit you pervert girl?"<p>"WHAT!"<p>Shampoo lifted her other bonbori, "Akane is still<br/>obstacle."<p>Ranma-chan snatched Akane around in her arm to the other<br/>side of cursed body while stopping the metal ball with the<br/>free hand. "Shampoo, I told you to leave Akane alone! No<br/>matter WHAT you do, I will not wish Akane killed forever!"<p>Her body hugged against Ranma's half-dressed body, Akane<br/>groaned, "Ranma thinks Shampoo meant ME when he heard her<br/>talking about the girl-type."<p>Shampoo asked, "Why girl-type Ranma not act in fear of<br/>Shampoo like always? –Hai, yah! Girl-type Ranma is only in<br/>Ranma mind! And Shampoo kill girl-type Ranma!"<p>Ranma-chan told her, "Akane AIN'T a girl-version of me! I<br/>told you to leave her alone! I can't fight a girl," and,<br/>with just her grip on the ball, he pulled the bonbori from<br/>Shampoo's hand, "but I can do other things." Saying that,<br/>Ranma-chan flung the weapon out of sight.<p>Shampoo didn't believe Ranma, "Ranma fight Shampoo in<br/>village and insult Shampoo. Ranma fight Shampoo in town and<br/>marry Shampoo."<p>Ranma-chan told her, "I didn't marry you! What happened at<br/>the Tendo's was an accident! And I fought you in a<br/>tournament: That ain't the same as fightin' a girl!"<p>Shampoo got a calculating smile, "If Ranma not fight<br/>Shampoo, how Ranma defeat Shampoo?"<p>The wind came out of Ranma-chan's sail. "Uh...how am I<br/>gonna defeat her?" She glanced around for an idea. She<br/>even looked at the girl in her arms.<p>Akane gazed up into Ranma's big, blue eyes. All she could<br/>think to say was a word of encouragement, "Ranma."<p>Ranma remembered the times they had together. Akane was an<br/>inspiration.<p>Ranma-chan returned her gaze at the Amazon. It was defiant.<br/>Ranma's confidence had come back, " "A girl's hair is her<br/>life"."<p>Shampoo's hand darted to her long, lush locks, "Ai! Shampoo<br/>hair!"<p>By her reaction, Ranma-chan knew she had found a weak<br/>point. Akane also once had long, lush locks. When Ranma and<br/>Ryoga had accidentally cut them off it had been one of the<br/>worst days of Akane's life. And Ranma's.<p>Ranma released Akane, and pushed her away from the<br/>immediate harm of the first actions and reactions. "Shampoo<br/>there ain't nothing in the Code against makin' a girl<br/>bald."<p>Shampoo cried, "Hai-Yai! Womens of Clan which lead Amazon<br/>MUST have long hair! Is like flag in battle."<p>Ranma-chan shed the loose shirt that would be getting in<br/>the way, and put herself into the defend-or-attack stance,<br/>"Your speed against my speed."<p>Shampoo held up her remaining bonbori and got into the<br/>stance; she, too, was defiant, "Shampoo ALWAYS shampoo!"<p>... By this time, students from Ranma's and other<br/>classrooms had seen what was happening and had finally made<br/>it out in front of the school and had begun to form a semi-<br/>circle of spectators: "She's topless!"/ "What are those<br/>girls going to do?"/ "Are all THREE of them going to<br/>become topless?"/ Is this going to be a catfight?"/<br/>"Topless?"/ "If it is, it's going to be a martial arts<br/>catfight."/ "All I know it sounds like there's going to<br/>be a lot of hair pulling."/ "Then MY money's on the one<br/>in the redhead! All she has to protect is that braid."/<p>Akane cried, "RANMA!" and tossed her things from her<br/>bookbag. Things she had gotten from Dr. Tofu.<p>Ranma caught the pair of scissors that were originally<br/>meant to cut the roll of bandage she also caught. Akane had<br/>intended to bind up Ranma's female breasts, scratching the<br/>male Ranma's chest if she had to.<p>Since Shampoo hadn't thrown away her weapon, it was okay<br/>for Ranma to have her own. Besides, the Code against guys<br/>not fighting girls gave Shampoo the advantage.<p>Shampoo lunged. Ranma stepped aside to let her pass,<br/>chopping the bonbori handle in half. Behind Shampoo, now,<br/>Ranma used the roll of bandage like a martial arts rhythmic<br/>gymnastics' ribbon, wrapping it around Shampoo's long,<br/>lavender hair. Ranma yanked, and the bandage snagged around<br/>the locks, pulling Shampoo off of her feet.<p>Ranma-chan stood over her, scissors ready, "Admit defeat,<br/>and I'll leave your hair alone!"<p>Shampoo wept, "Shampoo NO can admit defeat. Amazon woman<br/>must marry man which defeat Amazon woman. Amazon woman must<br/>kill woman which defeat Amazon woman...or die."<p>Ranma-chan growled in her throat. This would be a useless<br/>act. But what else could she do? Was it honor to not go<br/>through with the stake the battle had been fought on?<br/>Wouldn't it be like not meeting your commitment?<p>Akane spoke up, "Shampoo! You have killed Ranma the girl.<br/>And," glancing over at the girl exposing herself in public,<br/>tears catching in her throat, "and you defeated Ranma, the<br/>man. There is no reason to remain in Japan any longer. Go!<br/>Use this loophole in your stupid Amazon laws, and..." her<br/>voice became quiet, "just go."<p>Shampoo nodded, "Shampoo go." She had won. But she was not<br/>proud of how she had won. All that she had left to her was<br/>her honor.<p>/<p>By the time Shampoo had leaped and bound out of sight, the<br/>teachers had come out to gather their students back to<br/>classes. But they were still looking as Ranma-chan, wearing<br/>Hiroshi's oversized shirt, followed Akane out of the gate.<br/>The redhead asked, "Why do we have to leave early? It's<br/>gotta be still second period!"<p>Akane told her, "Yes, we have to leave. We've disrupted<br/>class time! Staying around, we'll just cause more<br/>disturbances."<p>Ranma-chan snorted, "Hmh! We've disrupted class before."<p>Akane reminded her, "Not that often. Your first day at<br/>school, when you and Kuno jumped into the pool, that<br/>happened basically during homeroom period. The others spent<br/>most of their first period taking a snap exam as punishment<br/>while we went home. Admittedly the day you attacked poor<br/>Ryoga, nobody returned to school. But, yesterday, when<br/>Shampoo broke into class, it was during lunch-and-"<p>Ranma-chan bowed her head, "Okay. I see the pattern."<p>Akane took Ranma's hand, no longer so concerned with what<br/>others may think. The ordeal had weakened her barriers,<br/>"Besides, there's something at home I want to show you."<p>Ranma-chan became a little suspicious. "What's there now<br/>that you couldn't show me before?"<p>Akane grinned wickedly as she squeezed the hand of Ranma's<br/>female half, "How much I really care about you. Just the<br/>same way you showed me that you cared yesterday when I lost<br/>my memory." If insults were what was needed, then there was<br/>one sure way to make Ranma know she was woman. Their whole<br/>relationship WAS marked insults, after all.<br/>The End
