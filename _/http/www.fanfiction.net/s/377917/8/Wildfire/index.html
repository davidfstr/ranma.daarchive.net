</div><p>[Ranma/O!MG + sm + tm</p><p>The thunder of hooves was a familiar sound to the chariot's driver. Two mighty stallions pulled the chariot across the heavens. It was his duty, and, although it was a never ending task, it was a responsibility that he bore with pride on any normal day. This day, his responsibilities had an addition that he welcomed with all his heart.</p><p>She had returned home.</p><p>He laughed aloud with joy as his chariot rumbled across the sky above her home. Looking over the side, he caught sight of her near the central pavilion. Her face was turned up as she followed his progress through the air. Her distinctive crimson hair caught the rays of the sun and seemed to dance with a flame all their own. He tore his gaze away from that welcome sight long enough to guide his team down to her.</p><p>In moments, the chariot was stopped not far from where she was standing. She walked toward him slowly as he jumped down from his chariot. Grinning widely, he moved up to her and enveloped her in an exuberant hug. "Ah, Kinhoshiko," he exclaimed happily as he spun her around, "it is so good to see you again!"</p><p>DISCLAIMER: I lay no claim to characters from Ranma 1/2, Tenchi, Sailor Moon, Ah! My Goddess!

It had taken her what seemed to be several months to rebuild the shrine, but the job was finally complete. Where once there was a delicate Grecian style structure of crystal and stone, now a wooden building with a distinct Japanese styling stood.</p><p>The sun dipped lower toward the cloud masked horizon. When it settled into the proper position, the warm golden rays shone full into the interior of the shrine. Each of the four walls was dominated by the wide sliding paper screens that allowed air and light to enter freely. The black marble gate stone, once elevated above the floor of the old structure, was now flush with the smooth wooden floor of the shrine. It was the center point of the building, occupying the place under the high peaked roof.</p><p>To the east and west of the shrine, the gurgling fountains and shallow pools remained. The constant sound of the flowing water formed a soothing counterpoint to the occasional rush of wind. The area south of the shrine had been extensively reworked. An ornate park of marble sculptures and tall, mazelike hedge rows had been relocated to another part of the isle. Now, a clearing of packed dirt was all that remained. This training area showed signs of constant and heavy use. North of the shrine, a small, well tended rock garden separated the shrine from another, smaller building of similar styling.</p><p>The redhead paused as a now familiar sensation gathered. She fought to control the wild and tenuous whip of energy that surged about her. However, as with all previous attempts, she found herself unable to retain a hold on it. With a brief vision of a mangled pot dancing in her eyes, her form twisted and melted. The change was not as drastic as it had been before, but there was still a still a small difference in the height of his two forms. The willowy curves of his feminine form melding into his wiry masculine frame.</p><p>He sighed as he knelt once more, faced the repositioned sun and settled down for a wait. The change no longer really bothered him. It was the fact that it remained out of his control, once again, that annoyed him immensely. In the month before Urd had brought him here, he had learned how to control his form with sufficient application of ki. Now, in attempting to control the change, he felt like he was fighting a natural part of himself. He'd had no control over the changes since his arrival.</p><p>He believed it wouldn't be very long before his invitation was answered. Although he had no certain way to determine exactly how long he had been here, he was certain it had to have been many months, or even a few years. Thankfully, his time here had not been boring. The very timelessness of the place made it impossible to be distracted by the passage of time. That wasn't the real reason, however, that he had not succumbed to terminal boredom. Were it not for his sensei and the skills and knowledge that they offered, then he may very well have gone crazy anyway. It was in just this sort of setting, when the old shrine still stood and and the sun was in that location, that he met his first sensei. Of course, he had been a girl at the time...</p><p>Haisano gazed upon the sun as it hung motionless above the cloud covered horizon. Urd had abandoned her here, with no obvious way off this strange island, what she guessed was several days prior. It was hard to determine the passage of days when the sun never moved. In that time she had discovered her ki was walled off or blocked somehow. She could sense it, but she couldn't manipulate it or use it to enhance herself in any way. It was worse than that moxibustiation weakness point Happosai had used upon her. At least with that, she could still use her ki for movement and speed. At odd times, she could feel her level of ki fluctuate. It almost felt like she was giving her ki to someone else.</p><p>After the first few hours, once she had been able to move again, Haisano wasted no time in searching for a way off this strange mountain top. This exploration revealed that she was not on a mountain, but on a strange little island floating over and among a seemingly endless sea of clouds. She decided to explore her prison, as she saw it, in more detail when it became apparent that Urd was not going to be returning any time soon.</p><p>Throughout her exploration, the sun had neither risen further into the sky, nor set. It remained stationary just above the horizon. It also seemed much smaller than it should be, although the warmth and remained the same. Since it didn't move, every part of the island received light from the star in different proportions. One side was always in direct sunlight. The other was always in the shadow of the island itself; a form of perpetual twilight. The plants on the direct side grew thick and tall, and were of a hearty tropical stock that could readily withstand the constant heat. Most of the island's streams wound their way amongst the roots of these trees before making the final plunge off the side. The middle sections of the island supported plants with more temperate requirements. The dark side was mostly covered in ferns and similar soft light plants.</p><p>Throughout her search, she had found a multitude of places where training could be performed. All across the flying island, there were clearings and glades, pools and waterfalls. In places, clearings were filled with an assortment of fixed obstacles, beams and poles for practice. In others, the growth of the flora created a natural arboreal gymnasium. Most appeared to be for weapons use, but, she was confident she could adapt to using them to keep up her unarmed skills, if she were to be stuck here for long.</p><p>Scattered across the island, she found several large trees that stood out from the rest. Each one stood in its own pond of water which had a series of stepping stones leading out across the pond to the base of the tree. Of greater note to her, in each great tree she could sense massive amounts of ki. They greatly resembled the sacred tree at the Masaki shrine, but were several times larger. At first, she kept well clear of them, but eventually her curiosity won out over caution. She approached one of those strange trees. As she stepped out upon the first stone, she had felt the ki surge within the plant. Streamers of light shot out from the leaves and bounced off the surrounding pond. The reflected streams of light formed a broad, multi-hued beam of energy that lanced up into the clear sky above. At the same time, her vision started to black out.</p><p>Uncertain as to the cause of this event, she retreated quickly and returned to the large atrium to think. So now, she found herself staring at the burning orb hanging motionless in the sky. She should have burned out her eyes by now, but the light didn't bother her at all. Even the brilliant spark moving away from the sun was easy to pick out against the overall glare of the sun.</p><p>Haisano blinked a few times and looked away for a moment and then looked back. The spark was still there, but now it was apparent to her that the spark was moving closer and growing larger. The glittering mote of light swelled as it drew closer. It wasn't long before she could make out a shape within the brilliance.</p><p>Moving toward her little floating prison was a chariot drawn by a pair of matched white stallions. Flames leapt from the hooves of the magnificent beasts as they galloped through the sky. The chariot trailed a stream of fire behind the two flashing wheels. Silver and gold inlays ran the length of the vehicle adding to the brilliance. In the chariot, with one hand firmly holding the reins, stood a man. He was the source of the brilliant light.</p><p>As the chariot thundered overhead, casting the warm radiance down upon the island, Haisano stood and stepped out from beneath the arches of the atrium. As she did so, she heard a delighted laugh from the man. Unlike the laughter she was accustomed to hearing, the man's voice was full of mirth and joy. She stepped around the atrium, expecting to see the glowing chariot receding into the distance. Instead, she saw that is was slowing, and circling back toward her prison.</p><p>Now that it was moving slower and descending to land, she was able to make out more details on the lone occupant. He was a caucasian man, appearing to be in his mid to late twenties. His full beard and thick head of wavy golden hair streamed out behind him along with a golden cloak. Armor of European design, fashioned from small overlapping scale-like golden plates covered his torso, but his arms and head were bare. A large sword, also of European design, was strapped across his back.</p><p>The man's eyes twinkled above a broad grin as he reigned in his steeds and stopped the chariot a few meters from where Haisano was standing. He hopped from the back of his hovering chariot, setting his golden scale armor to jingling. His fur lined boots thudded onto the packed dirt of the practice ground. Standing at least two meters tall, he towered over her.</p><p>Upon the man's face, Haisano could easily pick out markings similar to the ones she saw on Urd's face, and, more recently, upon her own. Centered on his forehead, was a star burst similar to her own. At the corner of his eyes, where she had a pair of curved marks resembling claws, he had a single long diamond shape. Even more startling were his eyes. His left eye was a bright blue, similar to her own. His right eye, however, was a rich emerald green. Haisano had never seen a person with eyes of different colors before then. She was distracted enough by this observation that she was totally unprepared for him to step up to her and envelop her with his arms.</p><p>"Ah, Kinhoshiko," he cried as he spun her about, "it is so good to see you again!" Haisano stiffened with outrage at the unexpected and unwelcome contact. "Let me have a look at you," he said as he set her upon her feet and stepped back. Before he had move more than a single step, her fist flew up and embedded itself in his face. Even with the difference in size, her blow knocked the blonde stranger back into the side of his chariot.</p><p>"Are ya' done squeezing me yet?" she snapped as she glared at the tall god and settled into a ready stance. "You try something like that again, you pervert, and I'll kick your but off this rock!" Haisano was prepared for almost any reaction. The usual response she got from all the perverts was a declaration of love, or lust. The next most common reaction was cries of vengeance or for some perceived slight. Failing that, her rivals would come up with some other form of response combining some aspect of the two. She didn't expect the stranger to burst into laughter.</p><p>She stood in her ready stance and stared at the stranger in stunned amazement. She had smacked him almost as hard as she usually hit Kuno, and he was laughing at her. Her face flushed darker as her anger grew. She reached for, and found, that deep well of power that she discovered access to during her battle with Saffron. Her ki was blocked off, but this was even easier to summon than before. Winds erupted about her as her aura flared into a flaming crimson pillar of power. "And just what do ya think is funny?" she snarled as he slowly stood once more.</p><p>Holding up his hands he gestured in a placating manner. "Peace, My Lady," he said. He wiped his eyes as he continued to chuckle, "Peace. I laugh not at you, but at myself. When I was told that you had returned once more to your home I could not wait to welcome you back. In my joy at seeing you here after such a long time I forgot myself and overstepped the bounds of courtesy."</p><p>"You're darned right you did!" she snapped, "Who do you think you are, waltzing up and grabbing me like that?" Her glare didn't diminish as she waited for him to explain himself.</p><p>The stranger's chuckles died away as his amused expression faded and a sense of sadness grew. "I see. You did loose much of thyself, Lady Kinhoshiko. I apologize for welcoming you back in that manner." The man spread his hands wide as he continued to speak. "I am known as Odur, God of the Sun, Category One, Class Two, Limited. I am husband to Freya, driver of the Chariot of the Sun, and heir to Odin and Lodur." He then bowed low to her in European fashion and intoned, "At your service, My Lady."</p><p>Haisano blinked and relaxed her stance a bit when he mentioned having a wife. The power she had gathered dissipated slowly as a smirk formed on her expressive face. "Odor?" she asked. "What kind of name is that?"</p><p>The god winced slightly and shook his head. "No, not odor," he corrected with a strained smile, "Odur. O - d - U - r."</p><p>Haisano shrugged and brushed aside the correction, "Whatever. That doesn't tell me why you grabbed me like that."</p><p>"As I said," Odur replied cheerfully, "I was so overjoyed to see you alive once more I forgot that you may not remember me. I was well known to you in one of your prior incarnations, Kinhoshiko."</p><p>"Prior what?" the red-head asked as she raised a hand to forestall any other comments.</p><p>"Incarnation. As in, reincarnation," he explained. "When you were Sol Haisano, Goddess of the Sun, you knew me very well." He paused then grinned, "I was like the son you never had."</p><p>Haisano felt her stomach lurch at his comment. She could almost feel the blood draining from her face. "W-what? What do you mean, son?" she demanded.</p><p>"Well, okay, not really a son," he admitted. "You were my mentor before I was given my first domain." Haisano sighed with relief as he continued. "Now, it seems that it is my turn to return the favor, after a fashion. I have been given the honor of reintroducing you to the rules and responsibilities associated with your newly recovered divinity."</p><p>The redhead stared at his smiling face for a moment, expecting him to continue. When he did not, she muttered, "What?"</p><p>"That means," he said, "I am your new sensei!"</p><p>"What?" she repeated. She waved her hand before he replied again and added, "I mean, what rules? What responsibilities? What are you talking about?"</p><p>"Ah, I understand," Odur said, nodding. He thought for a moment before he continued speaking. "Well, I ask you, is a martial artist free to do whatever she wants, to whomever she wants?"</p><p>Haisano snorted and, thinking of a certain old pervert and panda, said, "Depends on who ya ask."</p><p>"I am asking you," the god replied softly and without the smile of moments before.</p><p>"No. A true martial artist cannot be and is not free to do, as you say, whatever she wants to whomever she wants. That is completely opposite the code. A true martial artist should use the art to protect those who cannot protect themselves. The art should not be used to injure or kill unless to protect the life of another."</p><p>Odur nodded and, with his wide grin back in place, said, "Good enough. The rules for a deity are not very dissimilar."</p><p>"So," Haisano drew out the word as she peered cocked her head to the side and looked up at the tall god from under her brows. "You are saying being a god or a goddess like being a martial artist or something?"</p><p>Odur laughed again as he responded, "Yes, or something. As a martial artist, you believed that it was your duty to protect those who could not protect themselves. The martial code laid down some basic rules for you to follow and you undertook them as well as can be expected considering how your mortal life went."</p><p>"'As well as can be expected?'" Haisano repeated with an annoyed tone of voice.</p><p>"Well, yes," he said. "Consider who it was that raised you for most of your mortal life. It is amazing that your basic nature wasn't perverted into something that would have made you totally unfit to resume your role, Kinhoshiko. As it is, you have a great deal of information to relearn and forgotten skills to unlock. There has been some file degradation, but I am confident that, given time, we can repair that damage. However, with some key parts of yourself still missing, it will not be easy."</p><p>The redhead glanced down at herself then "Hold on there! What do you mean by that. What is missing?"</p><p>Odur leaned against the side of his chariot. His smile dimmed and he seemed to consider her question for a moment before responding. "I will answer that by asking you this question. Who are you?"</p><p>"My name?" she asked. When he shrugged, she said, "I'm Ra... I am Haisano."</p><p>"Ah," the god said as he smiled slightly at her, "you were going to say 'Ranma,' correct?"</p><p>In response, Haisano shook her head swiftly, "N-no. He is just a bad memory. I am no longer that person. I am Haisano, now."</p><p>"I see." he said with a sight frown. "In that case, tell me of your parents."</p><p>Haisano flinched and her face hardened. "Oh, right," she sneered, "them. They are just as dead to me as Ranma. I have no parents!"</p><p>"Interesting," he murmured. He looked at her for a moment then shook his head and said. "Kinhoshiko, you are wrong. It is Haisano who is but a memory. Ranma is very much alive. Haisano loved her parents and honored their memory. If you were truly Haisano, you would know that. You are Ranma."</p><p>"I," she began then bit her lip. After a moment, she continued, "I gave up that name. My family rejected me. They rejected what I had become. They wouldn't allow me to make my own decisions or give me any way to keep everyone's honor intact.</p><p>She shuddered as she wrapped her arms around herself. "Don't you understand? I sacrificed my own honor to remove myself from that family. When Ranma's mother rejected me as well, I decided to give up the name of Ranma, also. I have memories of Haisano. They aren't all good, but her life can't have been as bad as my... as Ranma's. Besides, she was the spirit of Jusenkyo, I gave myself to her willingly in order to defeat Saffron and rescue Akane. Why can I not use her name?"</p><p>The blonde god looked down at his feet in apparent thought for a moment following Haisano's response. After a moment, he glanced up at her without moving his head. "If you cannot accept your life as Ranma, how do you expect to accept the full memories of Sol Haisano's mortal life? She was the last daughter of the House of Sol in the Second Age of Man. Are you sure you can deal with the reasons why she was the last? She became the Goddess of the Sun and an active supporter of the Lunar Kingdom that united the Third Age. She fell along with the Kingdom she supported. Will you be able to accept why that happened?"</p><p>"I'm sure I can accept her life... my life," Haisano replied with confidence she did not feel.</p><p>Odur pushed away from his chariot and towered over the petite red-head and glared down at her. "Well then, 'Haisano,' perhaps you can tell me what your duties as a Category One, Class One, Unlimited deity are?"</p><p>She stared blankly at him for a moment. She started to speak a few times but nothing came forth.</p><p>"Where," he continued after a momentary pause, "does your power originate?"</p><p>Haisano remained silent.</p><p>"What are the rules for using that power?"</p><p>"I-I-I d-don't..." she stammered before he cut her off.</p><p>"Who are your friends? What allies can you call upon? Who are your rivals or even your enemies?"</p><p>"Enemies?"</p><p>Odur disregarded her question and continued his questions one after another. "What was the name of your father? Your mother? Her co-wife? How about your brother and sister?"</p><p>"I had a brother and sister?" Haisano asked softly.</p><p>"How and why did you become a goddess, Haisano? That much, at least, you should remember!" Odur fell silent, finally giving her a chance to respond.</p><p>For several minutes, they stood like that. He waited patiently as Haisano looked away and thought over his questions. Eventually, she looked up at him once more and slowly replied. "I... no. No, I do not remember. Are you happy now? I do not remember any of that."</p><p>"Good." Odur said with a smile.</p><p>"'Good!'" Haisano retorted. "Is that all you have to say? You rant at me like that and then all you have to say is 'Good?'"</p><p>Odur smirked. "Yes," he said with a sharp nod of his head.</p><p>Haisano flushed in anger and clenched her fists as she fought to contain her anger at the annoying god standing near her. After a moment, she composed herself and found her center once more. She looked back up at him when he continued speaking. "It is good that you see and admit your lack of knowledge. From that beginning, I can show you how to take the reins of your destiny in hand once more. You took the first step when you ended the engagements that Genma established for Ranma. However, in refusing to acknowledge your life as Ranma, you risk ignoring what that life has taught you. Do not cheapen the life you have had or the good you have done in spite of the hardships. By throwing away that life, you do far more harm to yourself than to those who you seek to punish by it.</p><p>"So, If I am not Haisano, then who am I?"</p><p>"Ahh, now that is the question, isn't it," he said with another broad smile. "You have had many names. You were known as Haisano, Fire Talent, of the House of Sol to the people of the Second Age and Sol Haisano, Goddess of the Sun to those of the Third Age of Man. That name was yours in another life and should you choose to use that name, then that is your choice. More recently, your reborn spirit was called Takashina, Honorable Virtue. To the ancestors of the Celts, you were Edana, the Fiery. In the Gaelic tongue, you have been called Ona, the Graceful One. To the people who later became the Nyuchezu, you were Serilda, the Warrior Maiden."</p><p>"However," he continued, "you are who you choose to be. In the end, what is in a name? Recently you have been Ranma the Wild Horse and unofficially, Ranko the Wild Child. Either would suit your current incarnation perfectly. As the goddess Haisano, one of your foci was honor. In this life, you have been following that focus as best you knew how. Considering that, either Ranma or Ranko Takashina would be an appropriate name. You are, above all else, the Kinhoshiko, the Golden Star. No matter what name you choose to go by, many will always refer to you as such, myself included."</p><p>"That doesn't really help, you know," Haisano complained. "You say all that as if I have had many lives. Why don't I remember them?"</p><p>"As I had said, you have lost much of yourself. None of your past lives since Sol Haisano's sacrifice ever survived to reach Jusenkyo and merge with the part of yourself trapped therein. Your enemies saw to that. Even so, there is much of your essence still tied up in the magic that was Jusendo. In time, you will eventually recover it all. When those who bore the curse of Jusenkyo died, the part of yourself that was tied to their life force was released to once again return to the springs. Now that you have merged with that part of yourself, those fragments will return to you. With them will come the accumulation of the experiences gained from their life."</p><p>Haisano became troubled over this revelation."Does that mean," she asked," that their souls will come to me instead of being reborn?"</p><p>"What?" Odur exclaimed, then shook his head. "No, no worries about that. The souls of those cursed by the power of Jusenkyo will go on to their final destination as decreed by their life. What you will recover is the bit of your own spirit that clings to them and powers their curse."</p><p>"Oh," Haisano sighed, "That's okay then."</p><p>Odur nodded, then continued his explanation. "Unfortunately, time is not something that is on your side. There are events occurring that you are not prepared to face as you are now. So, you may need to take a more direct hand in the recovery of your memories, your power, and your heritage. Should you turn your back upon your life as Ranma, then you will find recovering yourself that much harder to accomplish."</p><p>"If my spirit is stuck to people with the curse," the red-head said, "how am I supposed to get it back? I wont have to kill them, will I? If so, I ain't gonna do it!"</p><p>"No. That won't be necessary Kinhoshiko." Odur replied. "That, however, is a lesson for another day. Going back to the point I am trying to make, what you choose to be called is entirely up to you. What other people call you is entirely up to them. You cannot force someone to use one name over another when referring to you. So, why should others be able to force you to use a different name? Do not allow the actions or inactions of those who were your family and friends decide your name or your future. Once you are fully restored, the system will log your chosen name. Be certain that it is the one that most suits you.</p><p>You should not be asking me who you are. I should be the one asking you. So, Kinhoshiko, who are you?" As he spoke, Odur jumped back onto his chariot and gathered the reins. "I must return to my duties, or Freya will be crying an ocean of gold awaiting my return."</p><p>Before she could respond, Odur let out a yell as he snapped the reins, urging his stallions back to work. "I will return, Kinhoshiko," he called back to her. "Think on what I have said."</p><p>The young man smiled as he thought about that first meeting with Odur, his first sensei. At first, he had not thought over the issue of his name as the kami had suggested. Several visits passed before the subject came up again.</p><p>It was just after his first true encounter with the stored memories of his past life's memories. He had finally decided to investigate one of those great trees with the massive ki signature. This time, when the visions started, he did not pull back from them. He wanted to see what the tree had to show him.</p><p>He had watched, from Haisano's viewpoint, as the immense weapon of the destroyers killed her planet. He had felt her determination to save her people, even if she could not save her planet. He had felt her lifeforce being expended in powering an energy form she knew as The Wings to move her people from the doomed planet to somewhere else. He had felt the incredible surge in lifeforce as the trees added their own energy to hers and the power of the Wings multiplied by several factors, helping her to move far more people to safety than her own lifeforce would have allowed.</p><p>It would have been easy for her to save herself. It was not in her nature to save her own life when those of her people were endangered. She had not the time nor the energy to depart the planet in order to find a way to defeat the destroyers. Had she left, her people would have been destroyed. Instead, she saved her people.</p><p>The last of her people on the planet had been relocated. At last, she turned her attention to the battle raging above. One last heavy cruiser, the Phoenix, remained between her doomed planet and the weapon that would murder it. The battered ship had no chance of stopping the planet killer or the scores of enemy vessels escorting it. Yet the ship remained - the crew choosing to fight to the last. It was a valiant, futile gesture. Her people would need warriors willing to protect them at all cost. As the foe closed in, Haisano reached out with the power of the wings, embraced the Phoenix, and pushed the ship into hyperspace.</p><p>She could feel her sense of self fading fast even as the trees continued to pour their own life force through her. It was far too much for any human, even one descended of Jurian royalty, to channel. Even as she focused on the Phoenix and their destination, she could feel the darkness closing in. Her body stiffened as her arms stretched forth toward the sun's warm radiance. Her feet sank into the rich loam and her senses sight, sound and touch faded.</p><p>The weapon of the Destroyers struck.</p><p>An entire planet screamed from the death blow.</p><p>Haisano, overwhelmed by the sudden, searing rush of life energy, lost her grip on the Phoenix. The surge of energy cast the battered craft away through time and space.</p><p>The Destroyers closed in on the stricken planet. Like carrion hunters circling a dying beast, they gathered. Their purpose became clear to Haisano. The enemy sought to capture the life force released by the cataclysmic collision and the death of an entire planet.</p><p>It was not to be.</p><p>Still tied to the lifeforce of her home, Haisano became the recipient for all the energy the Destroyers sought to steal. Her mortal shell flared and burned as the titanic energies poured into and through her. Haisano, daughter of the House of Sol, ceased to exist. Even as she died, a new being was born.</p><p>Too much power. Too much life. The being that had been the last daughter of Sol screamed. For a brief moment in time, she was more brilliant than the star named after her family. In that brief moment, the Destroyers surged closer, seeking to capture this focused source of life energy.</p><p>Haisano gave them what they desired. However, she did not give it to them in the manner in which they desired. Instead of waves of unfocused energy, focused beams of destruction lanced forth. Whatever those beams touched, burned. In mere moments, more of the invaders were destroyed than in the months since Sol's main fleet was defeated near the eleventh planet.</p><p>Like a Phoenix. arising from its ashes, Haisano erupted from the surface of her dying home. Flames shrouded her as she danced among the burning ships of the Destroyers. In the blink of an eye, an eternity of destruction passed. The Destroyers were gone. Some fled. Most remained. Those that fought, died. Those that fled, escaped to tell the tale of the prey that became the hunter.</p><p>With the last of her foe fled or destroyed, the being known as Haisano returned to the tortured wreck of her home. The impact of the rogue moon tore a huge chunk of the planet's crust away. The sudden imbalance, combined with the planet's spin sealed its fate. It was slowly tearing itself apart. She could feel her strength waning as the stricken planet threw more of itself into space.</p><p>A sense of despair drew her attention away from Sol five. It was coming from further into the system. It was from the Sol three, the Juraiformed colony world where she had moved her people. With a thought, she jumped across the system.</p><p>She popped out of subspace and for a fleeting moment thought she had traveled in time instead of across the Sol system. She hovered in high orbit over the blue-green jewel of the life bearing planet. Hurtling down upon the refuge of her people was yet another moon turned into a weapon by the Destroyers.</p><p>She lashed out with all her strength. In seconds, the surface of the moon was rendered molten. Mighty engines, used by the Destroyers to nudge the moon from orbit and send it hurtling in -system, exploded violently. The explosion nudged the errant satellite moon of the eleventh planet slightly off course and her attack managed to slow it somewhat. It was not enough to prevent the moon from striking the planet, however.</p><p>Haisano placed herself between her people's new home and the hurtling weapon of the Destroyers and poured everything she had at the weapon. She hadn't the strength to destroy the moon, but perhaps she could adjust its path and slow it enough to spare her people.</p><p>Ever so slowly, the weapon slowed and turned. She could feel her home shuddering in its final death throes as she poured its life and thus her life into saving the fragile hope for the future on Sol three. The lifeforce she channeled weakened and faltered, but she did not. Even as the last of the energy from her dead planet passed to her, she held none of it back.</p><p>The river of force faded to a stream, then a mere whisper before fading altogether. Bereft of power, her own spark fading and her world dead, the being once known as Haisano could only hope that her efforts were not wasted.</p><p>He stood and looked out over the forest growing upon the chunk of land surrounding the shrine. Haisano's efforts had not been in vain. She gave her life twice to protect her people. First by moving them to Earth, sparing them the death of their home planet, and then by preventing the second weapon from destroying the Earth. It remained in orbit to this day as a remnant of a forgotten war. The sheer volume of life energy she threw at the moon must have saturated Earth's new satellite. Undoubtedly, this is why the Moon Kingdom that eventually expanded to colonize the entire Sol system used the moon as their capital. It was also likely the reason behind the attacks that resulted in the eventual fall of that Kingdom and the end to the Silver Millennium.</p><p>Before Haisano had faded completely, a presence had appeared next to her and offered her the chance to continue to watch over and protect her people or to pass on to the afterlife. Thus, Sol Haisano, Goddess of the Sun was born.</p><p>He shuddered as he though back on that terrible day. Would he have had the courage to make the sacrifices she did that day? She could have saved herself and her family and abandoned the planet to the Enemy. Had she done that, billions of people, men, women and children, would have died and the Destroyers would have been that much stronger and life as he had known it wouldn't have happened. The Earth would have been destroyed as well. For all intents and purposes, the Sol system would be devoid of habitable planets. Instead, She fought for her people even though she was hardly more than a child herself. She had lived the privileged life of a princess, and yet sacrificed it all for her people.</p><p>He lost his family and friends due to a conflict of honor. The were still alive. She lost friends, family and her planet to war. How could he justify claiming that he was Haisano? He could not. He would honor his predecessor and former incarnation, but, he was not and could not be her. Even if he recovered all of her power and memories, he was a different person.</p><p>In his time spent here, learning from Odur and Sif, he came to realize that fact. It would be better for him to honor her memories and uphold her ideals than to attempt to claim that he was Sol Haisano, First Class Goddess of the Sun, Honor and Battle. He could learn from her memories, however, just as he had his own to learn from. Perhaps, together, they could be greater than the sum of their parts. His name was Ranma.</p><p>Another gust of wind blew across the Isle causing the chimes in the trees to dance and sing in response. The aura of gathering power drew his attention to the gate. He turned to face it with a bit of surprise. Sif-sensei wasn't due back for more 'friendly sparring' until after Odur-sensei's next visit and he always rode in on his chariot. She was the only visitor he had received who used the gate and he really wasn't looking forward to repairing the shrine, again.</p><p>He walked slowly toward the shrine in order to meet his unexpected guest. The gate flared as a translucent sphere of energy snapped into place. The sphere faded to reveal a hovering goddess with long silvery-white tresses.</p><p>Urd had returned.</p><p>- end Wildfire Chapter 6 -</p><p>Notes</p><p>Edanna - Celtic 'Fiery'</p><p>Ona - Gaelic 'Graceful One'</p><p>Serilda - Germanic 'armed maiden of war'</p><p>Takashina - Japanese 'honorable virtue' (neutral/female)</p><p>Kinhoshiko - Japanese 'golden star' (gender neutral)</p><p>Haisano - Japanese 'fire talent'</p>
