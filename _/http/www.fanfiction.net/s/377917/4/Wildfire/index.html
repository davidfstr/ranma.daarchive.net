They are the property of their respective authors. Characters and situations from those series are used without their consent. This is a work of fanfiction for which I do not expect nor will accept compensation. This fiction is based upon Ranma 1/2, with strong influence from Ah! My Goddess and lesser cameos from the Sailors and possibly Tenchi. Ranma will not be a scout, related to a scout or have a prior engagement to a scout. Ranma will not be related to or engaged to Tenchi.</p><p>Champions of the 'true' fiancé probably won't like my portrayal of Akane or Shampoo. Ukyo gets off a little better, but she doesn't get lucky either. As it is a work of fanfiction, I am not trying to duplicate the canon Manga or Anime characters. Expect some (or a lot) of OOC.</p><p>- Wildfire Chapter 03 -</p><p>Ranma awoke with a start. She was lying under a tree in the park, not far from Furinken High. Clouds drifted overhead touched by the morning sun's brilliant rays. The sight calmed her, and seemed to give her a boost of energy. She had always enjoyed the mornings... Wait, that wasn't right. She usually slept in until the panda kicked her awake - him awake, or Akane dumped a bucket of water on him.</p><p>"Arrrgh!" Ranma exclaimed, as she rolled to her feet and looked about. Her pack was lying on the ground near her. Happosai was nowhere to be seen. "How did this get here? My pack should still be at the Tendo's." She put a hand to the back of her neck and scratched under her ponytail. "And where is the old freak? I owe him a pounding for fondling me like that," she grumbled. After looking around briefly, she shrugged. "Probably long gone by now."</p><p>How in the world had she wound up in the park? Oh. Just before she had totally lost her temper with the old freak, some strange girl appeared out of nowhere and introduced her hammer to Ranma's chin. Who was she, and - and why had she hammered her halfway across the district?</p><p>That girl had some serious strength to manage to knock her out for this long. Well, at least she had a restful night sleep. No nightmares... heck, no dreams at all as far as she could remember. Hmm, that was a definite plus. Perhaps she could persuade that crazy, hammer happy, non-fiancé girl to do it again. It had been months since she had as restful a night as that. Nah, she had just removed herself from one Hammer Air frequent flier plan, no sense in signing up for another.</p><p>Shrugging, Ranma lifted the pack to her back and started strolling out of the park, muttering. "Hmmm... what to do... what to do...? Who do I gotta see before I leave for good? Lessie. I told the Tendo's and the Amazons last night... Oh Man! Ucchan! I promised I would visit her." The redhead sprinted from the park and effortlessly took to the rooftops as she sped toward a certain okonomiyaki restaurant, never noticing the narrowed eyes that followed her path.</p><p>In the early dawn gloom within the dojo, a figure danced through a kata that emphasized strength and power over finesse and speed. The sound of snapping cloth accented the meaty smack of bare feet upon polished wood. After a time, the sweating figure completed its kata and slipped into a lotus position to meditate before continuing. A dark presence entered the trance like state with the figure.</p><p>"When will my vessel be ready, imotou-chan?"</p><p>"His despair and depression grow almost daily, oniisan. It can't be long now."</p><p>"I seem to remember hearing that before, imotou-chan."</p><p>"I... I was, overconfident, oniisan. I felt certain the death of his beloved would prepare him..."</p><p>"She lives still."</p><p>"I know. It is hard to believe, but true."</p><p>"You are attached to my vessel's chosen? I sense it imotou-chan. How could you let this happen?"</p><p>"And WHY shouldn't I, oniisan? She's perfect! She embraced my Fury as her own. With a bit more time and effort, she could become my first true disciple in millennia!"</p><p>"And what then of me, imotou-chan. Do you plan to leave me here to rot in this prison for yet another millennia?"</p><p>"... No ... Of course not, oniisan. But..."</p><p>"But, What?"</p><p>"The Norns are in the area again, oniisan. I have had to keep a low profile for the past month. It was only after I felt her fury peak again last night that I dared return."</p><p>"Bah! They are not warriors! Even YOU could defeat them!"</p><p>"Grrrr... and just WHAT is THAT supposed to mean, Zetsubo? Hmpf! For that remark, you can stay in there ANOTHER month for all I care!"</p><p>"Gekido! Wait just a seco..."</p><p>Standing, the figure stalked over to another part of the dojo and knelt before its target. Uttering the first sound of the morning, the figure shattered a stack of cinder blocks with a loud "Kyah!" as the crimson aura of rage flared and abruptly vanished.</p><p>The figure blinked and raised the dust covered hand to stare at it a moment before looking around in confusion.</p><p>Ukyo Kuonji sat morosely at the bar to her grill staring at the enameled top. "He promised. I believed him," she thought to herself, over and over. Nabiki had come around last night, just after she had closed, looking for Ranma. She had even told Ukyo some of what happened that evening after she left, without charging her. Ranma was gone. Some strange girl had appeared and hammered him and Happosai away from the Tendo compound.</p><p>Happosai had been found unconscious, battered and burned, in the practice field at Furinken High. He was recovering, albeit slowly, at the hospital. The staff had been warned of his... tastes. Of Ranma, the others had found no trace. There hadn't even been an impact crater. All his usual hangouts were searched without luck. Ucchan's had been the last, apparently at Kasumi's insistence.</p><p>"Ukyo-san?" Konatsu's voice broke into her reverie. She looked up at the effeminate kuonichi 'waitress'. "Have you been here all night?"</p><p>"He promised. I believed him," she said softly.</p><p>The cross-dresser glided over to the girl and helped her to her feet. "You need to get some rest, Ukyo-san. Ranma-sama has never failed to keep his word. He would not be likely to start now."</p><p>"I should have gone out after him. Once I heard... once... but he PROMISED ME!" she cried out and clung to her... friend. "...he promised." She sobbed into his shoulder as he swept her into his arms and awkwardly carried the exhausted girl upstairs and put her in bed.</p><p>She awoke hours later to the sounds of bustling activity below. The door chime rang, and a girl's cheerful voice called a greeting. Curious, she quickly freshened up and hurried downstairs. As she neared the dining room, she heard the girl again.</p><p>"No sir, I'm just filling in temporarily. Ukyo-san needed a break. She'll be down shortly." Was that Ranchan?</p><p>"Why, thank you sir! As I said, I am just filling in. The real worker of magic at this grill is Ukyo-san." The voice was right, but not the attitude. Ukyo reached the bottom of the stairs, and her jaw dropped. Standing behind her grill, wearing one of her aprons, cooking several okonomiyaki, stood Ranma in his cursed form.</p><p>As she watched, the boy turned girl skillfully flipped the grilled okonomiyaki onto the serving plates, her spatulas spinning and clicking with skill of an expert of the art of the hibachi grill. Konatsu breezed by and retrieved the prepared orders. She followed the kuonichi with her eyes, as he served several tables.</p><p>"Good afternoon, Ukyo-san!" the redhead's incredibly cheerful voice called to her. Her head snapped back toward the grill, eyes wide in shock, even if she managed to keep her mouth closed. "The lunch rush is almost over. Do you want to take over the grill?" When Ukyo numbly shook her head, the redhead continued, "OK then, have a seat, and I'll fix a 'Sunshine Special' for you."</p><p>"Right this way, Ukyo-san" Konatsu spoke from beside her. She jerked in surprise, startled by his sudden appearance. After seating her, Konatsu resumed his rounds. Within a few minutes, it became obvious that Ranma was doing a remarkable job keeping up with the lunch rush. All the time he had spent as a waitress at the Nekohaten had apparently paid off. He could read the short order tabs, and his speed training and raw martial arts talents helped with the preparations. Also, he must have actually been paying attention to her when she cooked for him. His skill at her art was apparent from the pleased reactions of the patrons.</p><p>Konatsu glided over to her table bearing a steaming plate and a tumbler of water. As he set it down, Konatsu said, "I hope you like spicy meals, Ukyo-san. She made one for me as well, and it is very good. You will need the water."</p><p>The okonomiyaki Ranma had prepared steamed in front of her. The delicious aroma made her mouth water. Arranged in a starburst pattern were assorted yellow and orange vegetables... most of them some form of pepper. As promised, it was good, almost as good as her own. It was well seasoned. Not quite as spicy as raw wasabi, but close.</p><p>"Not bad at all." She murmured between sips on her water. 'When has Ranma ever practiced my art?' she thought. 'Did he learn this just by watching me?'</p><p>Twenty minutes later, most of the lunch rush had departed, allowing Ukyo and Konatsu to clean up. With Ranma's help, the chore was completed in record time. This gave them all a chance to rest up before beginning preparations for dinner. Konatsu shooed the other two away, and made himself busy elsewhere, allowing them to talk.</p><p>"What happened last night, Ranma?" Ukyo began, "Nabiki stopped by, after I closed, looking for you. I - I wanted to go out and look too, but..." Her expression of worry was plain enough for Ranma to see.</p><p>"I don't remember what happened, exactly. That old pervert was groping me, then I remember hearing a strange voice shout something. I turn just in time to catch a hammer on the jaw. Then, I was waking up in the park this morning. I don't even remember having any dreams last night." She shook her head and grinned wryly as she continued, "The strange thing is, the blow wasn't that hard. It shouldn't have knocked me off my feet, much less across the district. Well, at least I got a restful sleep out of it."</p><p>"Nabiki said they searched all the parks, Ranma," Ukyo protested. "Why didn't they find you?"</p><p>"I don't know." Ranma shrugged, then gestured toward the floor. "First thing I did after I woke up was come here. I did promise you I would."</p><p>"I - I waited up all night for you, Ranma..."Ukyo said softly.</p><p>Ranma nodded slowly, "Konatsu told me that, or I would have awakened you. He had just put you to bed when I got here, however, so we agreed you needed the sleep more. Besides, I'm still here, aren't I?" she finished with another bright grin.</p><p>"You should have awakened me!" Ukyo pouted, her expression mixed with a bit of annoyance about having to wait to see her fia... her friend.</p><p>"No." Ranma replied firmly as she shook her head slowly. "You needed your rest. I am sorry you felt it necessary to stay up like that, but thank you all the same. It makes me feel better knowing that you still care for me." Her smile seemed to brighten the entire diner. "At least I know someone cares for me."</p><p>"Of course I care! You know how I feel about you!"</p><p>Konatsu padded over with a tea set. Tripping at the last minute, the contents of the tray landed in Ranma's lap. She let out a startled shriek and wound up dancing beside the table, her clothes steaming. "Ite! Hot! Hot!"</p><p>Ukyo and Konatsu stared at the redhead, both in shock, although for different reasons.</p><p>"Please forgive me, Saotome-san..."</p><p>"R-ranchan? You didn't change...?"</p><p>Ranma closed her eyes as a warm golden aura surrounded her. More steam billowed from her clothes, as the smell of damp cloth became even more apparent. A few seconds later, the steam and glow faded, and she opened her eyes, smiling. "Ahhh! Much better!"</p><p>"Ranchan...?" Ukyo stared at her in shock. She had seen strange marks appear on Ranma's face briefly before the aura and steam blocked them from view.</p><p>"I'm sorry Ucchan. This is a result of what happened last night. When Mister Saotome refused to release his son from the pledges made for him without his knowledge or approval, Ranma Saotome chose to lock away his male form."</p><p>"Why are you speaking of yourself like that, Ranma?"</p><p>The redhead smiled sadly. "I no longer am Ranma Saotome. Legally, I was removed from the Saotome register over a month ago. Today, it became official. Last night, Mister Saotome and Mister Tendo rejected my request that the engagement to any Tendo should be ended. So, by refusing to be the instrument by which the honor of the Tendo family is destroyed, I ceased being Ranma Saotome. Ranma, the Ranma you know, for all intents and purposes, died at Jusendo. He gave his life in exchange for that of the youngest Tendo. The person before you now is what remains."</p><p>"B-but... what about our engagement..." Ukyo whined softly.</p><p>Ranma sighed as she stared hard at Ukyo. Bowing deeply at the waist, she responded, "I am truly sorry Kuonji-san. I cannot honor any of the agreements made by Genma Saotome for his son. If I were to honor one agreement, I would also have to honor all the other agreements, including the one with the Tendo family." She maintained the bow as her hands clenched into fists.</p><p>"I, I'm sorry Ranma. Force of habit. Please, sit with me." Ukyo's expression as Ranma stood from her bow was pensive.</p><p>With apparent effort, the redhead relaxed and continued. "It was the only option I could see to ensure that no one's honor was insulted, Ukyo." Ranma returned to her seat opposite the chef. "By placing one person's or family's honor above another, that could only result in dishonor for all involved. The panda never bothered to worry about other people's honor. 'Anything Goes' so long as it kept him fed or out of immediate danger." She growled out.</p><p>"I have no respect for him. Any agreement he made lacked honor. It is small consolation, but my life has been ruined, much as your has, by Genma. Besides, I thought we had already agreed to be friends again... not fiancés. Has that changed?" she turned a sad face up to gaze calmly into Ukyo's eyes.</p><p>Ukyo couldn't bear the thought of thought of Ranma being sad. "No," she said after a moment. "Honestly, I will always prefer to have been your wife. But, I would rather be a friend than a stranger."</p><p>"Thank you, Ukyo - Ucchan." the redhead said, a bright smile once again in place. "That means more to me than anything else."</p><p>"What should we call you now?" Konatsu asked as he started gathering the scattered tea service.</p><p>Ranma blinked and looked at the kuonichi. "I - haven't given it much thought actually. I've been too busy with other things to even consider them. I guess I was hoping I would be able to put my name back on the Saotome clan register." She sighed and moved to help the kuonichi in the kitchen. "My mother... that is, Missus Saotome... may be willing to help. But I cannot count on it. I guess that I have no family now." She paused in thought for a moment, before brightening and saying, "If you like, you can call me Haisano."</p><p>"Fire Talent, eh? Does that have anything to do with your hair color?"</p><p>Ranma shugged without comment and returned the smile.</p><p>Ukyo remained silent for a moment, then quietly asked, "Would you consider joining the Kuonji family? We could be sisters."</p><p>The redhead looked at her friend for a moment. Emotions warred across her features, clearly visible to Ukyo. Joy, Anger, Happiness, and Sorrow fought briefly for dominance, only to be replaced by a calm expressionless mask. The lack of expression Ukyo immediately did not like.</p><p>"For now, I must decline you very generous offer," Ranma replied carefully. "Even if your father would agree... No. I'd best not impose." She held up a hand to forestall the protest Ukyo was about to voice. "That would be too much like agreeing to one of the Panda's agreements. The insult to the other families' honor would then have to be avenged. I am not prepared to bring that upon your family Ukyo-san. I am grateful for the offer, nonetheless." Ranma concluded with another of her bright smiles.</p><p>The two chatted for a few hours. Finally, Ranma stood. "Thanks Ucchan. Your friendship means a great deal to me." When Ukyo stood, she found herself enveloped in a hug from the smaller girl. She happily returned it until she felt Ranma pull away. "I'd better leave now. Word that I am here is bound to have gotten out by now. The last thing I want is to wreck your place, again, while defending myself. I will write when I can."</p><p>Ukyo fought back the tears that threatened to blur her vision as she watched her childhood friend and fiance... no. She watched her NEW friend gather her pack and leave. Only after the redhead was safely out the door and down the street, did Ukyo allow herself to cry.</p><p>Ranma walked briskly through Nerima, drawing startled stares from those who knew her, and lustful stares from those who did not. She decided to keep to the streets, so that word would spread that she was in fact leaving. Perhaps that would keep the lunatics and amazons away from Ucchan. She never had heard from Cologne whether she would accept the 'New Ranma' as a sister to Shampoo. Whoever that girl was with the hammer had made sure of that.</p><p>What is it with girls and blunt instruments anyway? Akane had her mallet and Ukyo, her bakers peel. Well, the spatulas could also be used as edged weapons, but she also used it as a giant paddle often enough. Shampoo loved her Bonbouri and Kodachi... Kodachi had her Rhythmic Gymnastics clubs, among other things.</p><p>Her mother... Nodoka Saotome that is... always carried a katana. But she was a woman, not a girl. Perhaps with maturity came the graduation from the blunt trauma weapons to something more elegant. No, wait... Cologne had that staff of hers. There went that theory. Also, Ryoga had his umbrella. Ranma snickered. If the theory had held true, that would mean Ryoga was really a little girl at heart, instead of a pig.</p><p>Still, it was possible that she would need to choose a weapon, especially if she was to lead a life as a girl for now. That thought was not very appealing though. She was skilled with most martial arts weapons, but choose not to rely upon one. Her fa... that is to say, Genma had drilled Ranma endlessly about how weapon users were weaker than 'pure' practitioners of the art. Ranma didn't believe a word of it, especially after her visit to the Mazaki shrine. Still, it was still going to take some time to work through that conditioning. After all, if she were to be the greatest martial artist of her generation, she would need to become the greatest in armed styles as well as unarmed. Limiting herself to purely unarmed styles was exactly that, a limitation. How can anyone be 'the best' with a limitation like that? Aside from that, since it is common knowledge that Ranma scorned weapons and weapons users, what better way to throw off any pursuit than by becoming a weapon user.</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted as she became aware of a familiar presence approaching. Looking about, she spotted a limousine drawing up along the edge of the crowded street. It stopped a short distance from her, allowing the passenger in the rear to get out. She sighed in frustration as she looked upon Tatewaki Kuno. She studied him carefully, as she continued along, her pace unchanged.</p><p>Instead of his usual hakima and bokken, he was attired in a western style sports jacket and slacks. Most unusual however were his actions. Instead of charging at her, yelling out his exuberant cries of affection, he merely stood in place, calmly awaiting her approach. No weapons were anywhere in sight.</p><p>This was an unexpected change from the young man. Ranma was tempted to turn and avoid the encounter entirely, but he was on the most convenient route to the transit rail station. He seemed more intent on speaking to her, than any of his usual activities. As she neared, she focused more of her attention on feeling out his mood. His ki was highly troubled, but not aggressive. He seemed, worried, although his expression remained difficult to see. He held his gaze low as he stared at the ground in before him. Her curiosity got the better of her. Besides, it was just as likely that she would finally get him to leave her alone.</p><p>He looked up at her as she neared to within a few meters. She was expecting a lecherous leer, or an arrogant sneer. Instead, as with the meeting last night, he appeared calm and sincere. "Ranma Saotome, I beg your indulgence and a favor. Would you be willing to hear me out?"</p><p>This stopped Ranma in her tracks as she looked up him. She cocked her head to the side as she studied the older young man. He certainly looked like Kuno. His voice sounded like Kuno. The words were not those of Tatewaki Kuno. Kuno never had asked for anything, nor had he ever called her by her former name when she was a girl.</p><p>Apparently taking her silence as assent, he continued. "Although I would prefer to discuss this in a more private locale, I can understand and accept why that may not be acceptable to you. If you are willing, I would ask that we take advantage of the privacy afforded by my vehicle. In return for the chance to speak to you, my driver will take you wherever you wish in Tokyo." He stopped speaking and looked at her hopefully.</p><p>She stared into his eyes thoughtfully for a moment without changing her expression. Finally, she spoke softly. "You would finally call me by that name only now that I may have to give it up." She watched as a brief flash of pain flickered across his features.</p><p>"I felt it counterproductive to call you by any other name I have used in the past. I do not wish to compound my errors. I would consider it a great honor to know how you wish to be addressed"</p><p>Ranma looked the young man over closely. His expression was hopeful, and his ki matched it. After a moment she responded, carefully, "For now, you may call me Haisano."</p><p>His eyes widened, as he became very excited. "Hai - Haisano-sama!" He bowed deeply to her. "I humbly ask you accept my apology. I deeply regret my actions of the past. Know that neither my sister nor myself will trouble you as we have in the past. Indeed, should you ever need our assistance, in any matter, we are yours to command."</p><p>Stunned, Ranma could only stare at the older Kuno as he very nearly prostrated himself at her feet. "That's... very, uhhh, nice, Kuno," she managed. "A-apology accepted."</p><p>Kuno straightened and smiled warmly at her. "Thank you, milady. You set my soul at ease."</p><p>A few hours later, a bemused Ranma sat in the back of Kuno's limousine. Where she had come up with the name Haisano, she wasn't sure. Wherever it came from, it felt right. Ukyo had apparently thought it a bit odd, but it certainly had excited Tatewaki Kuno for some reason. He seemed releaved to hear that name. Why or how it held any importance for the older teen, she did not yet know.</p><p>For the last few hours, they had ridden around the district as he babbled on about various things. She tuned him out for the most part. His comments about destiny and past lives grabbed her attention, however. She certainly hadn't expected a person like Kuno to believe in reincarnation, what with his constant proclamations of 'The Vengeance of Heaven.' Wouldn't that make him Christian? Oh, right. Christianity has one God. Tatewaki wasn't calling her an angel all the time, but a Goddess. How confusing.</p><p>She had been ready to discount what he was saying as the usual Kuno ravings and tune him out again, but when he started to describe a dream he had, she had listened closer. It was strange, but he had recounted the beginning of her recent nightmares almost verbatim, if from a different perspective. He went on about fighting side by side with the 'Fiery Goddess.' as she fought in the defense of his people at some sacred valley.</p><p>She snapped out of her daze when she realized someone was asking her a question. "Huh?"</p><p>"Where would you like to go, milady?" asked an older man, from the front of the car she found herself in. Her gaze snapped about, looking for Kuno, before she realized she was alone in the back of the vehicle.</p><p>"Oh." nodding once, she gave the address to the Saotome home.</p><p>"Thank you, milady. Please sit back and enjoy the ride." He maneuvered the large vehicle out into traffic. "There are refreshments available, please help yourself."</p><p>Tatewaki Kuno watched the black car pull away from the curb with a broad smile on his face, before turning and strolling up the street, a jaunty bounce to his steps.</p><p>Atop the building across the street, a short figure turned and vanished into the shadows.</p><p>Ranma thanked the driver as he held the door open for her. Hefting the pack that he had found far too heavy to budge, she walked up to the rebuilt Saotome residence. She stood nervously in the shadow of the entry gate for a few minutes. Something felt wrong here.</p><p>Glancing back, she saw the driver waiting patiently by the front of his vehicle. No, he wasn't the problem. After a moment, the feeling faded. Shrugging, she pulled on the bell, announcing her presence. The feeling was probably a result of her anxiety over meeting her mother. Would she accept the 'new Ranma,' or not?</p><p>Moments later, the door opened, revealing Nodoka Saotome, dressed in her usual kimono. The only difference was, she wasn't carrying the family blade. "Of course, baka," Ranma thought, "she's home, she doesn't need to carry it here."</p><p>"Yes? May I help..." Nodoka began, then shrieked "RANMA!" She grabbed her 'son' by the arm and said. "Come in, son! I've been so worried about you." As she pulled the young girl inside, she glanced around nervously, her eyes falling upon the limo and driver. A frown creased her face before she closed the door firmly. Turning, she looked over the red-head for a moment. Her expression changed minutely as her frown deepened and her eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>"Where have you BEEN? Do you know how we have worried for you?" she asked as she led Ranma deeper into the house, never once releasing her grasp on the cursed boy's arm. "I heard from Nabiki that another challenger attacked you last night."</p><p>"Well, I'm not sure where to start..." Ranma began before Nodoka interrupted her.</p><p>"Ah! Wait just a moment, Ranma, and I'll have some hot water ready for you." She released Ranma and hurried into the kitchen. The young martial artist followed slowly after setting her pack down. The nagging feeling that something was wrong would not go away.</p><p>Taking a small glass carafe over to her electric teapot, the kind that held a reserve of water heating at all times, she emptied the water into the top. Seconds later, the near boiling water poured into the waiting carafe below the empty filter basket. Ranma nodded appreciatively. One of those would have made life simpler at the Tendo home.</p><p>"Ummm, " Ranma began again, "I don't know how to say this, but I... that is, you see... " She sputtered and stumbled over the subject as Nodoka diluted the hot water, bringing the temperature down from scalding, to merely hot.</p><p>"Let's just put you back in your proper form, shall we?" Nodoka said cheerfully as she poured part of the water over the dithering redhead. "Now then, my son, where have... you... been...?" She trailed off, staring at the redhead. Her gaze switched back to the water. Steaming. Check. She poured more over the girl before her. Wet, steaming girl. "Wha - what has happened to you, Ranma? Why don't you change back?" She asked, a worried frown replacing the nervous smile she'd had moments before.</p><p>Ranma sighed as she used the technique she had developed to dry off as she had at Ucchan's. "I am sorry, Saotome-san. This happened last night." she said this without even a hint of regret in her voice. "Hot water will have no effect on me..." she silently added, 'unless I want it to, or a lot more than a single pot is used.'</p><p>"WHAAAT!" Nodoka shrieked at her. The pleasant woman vanished, like a dream. In her place stood a raging demon head that would make Suon a little envious. "How did this happen? How could you LET this happen?"</p><p>"Woah!" Ranma yelped, as she jumped back a few feet. "I hardly just LET this happen! In order to maintain the honor of several families, I believe I had no choice! Will you let me explain?" She stepped further back and to the side, moving nearer her pack, just in case. The 'out of place' feeling was getting stronger.</p><p>Chest heaving, Nodoka glanced at the shattered remains of the tea pot in her hands before turning her smoldering gaze back to the unwanted girl form in front of her. "Yes, 'SON,' I do believe you should explain this."</p><p>Ranma took a deep breath, then began. "Family honor is extremely important to you. Am I correct?"</p><p>"Of course it is! How does that explain..." she gestured sharply several times at Ranma's chest, "THIS?"</p><p>"Please, hear me out." At the woman's curt nod, Ranma continued, "Is the Saotome family honor more important than the Tendo family honor, or the Kuonji family honor, or that of any of the other families I am promised or have been sold to?"</p><p>"So, that's what this is about," Nodoka hissed. "You know that the other engagements are of no value! They have already been dealt with. As far as the Kuonji are concerned, that engagement had equal standing with the Tendo due to the dowry already claimed by Genma. However, her disgraceful actions at the wedding nullify that claim. Your only valid fiancé is Akane Tendo," she declared. "Now, WHY IS THIS PERMANENT?"</p><p>"Before the enforced wedding," Ranma continued, "you had left me the choice of marrying a violent maniac because of a drunken promise by your honor-less husband, or a girl I consider a friend, and nothing more. That was no choice."</p><p>"It was your DUTY to choose. When you failed to do so, it fell to ME to choose for you." Nodoka snapped.</p><p>"Y-YOU chose!" Ranma gasped, stunned. She hadn't known that her moth... that is, Nodoka had chosen to force the wedding. "Have you any idea what you have done?" Ranma asked in a small, sad voice.</p><p>"I have undertaken necessary steps to ensure the continuation of this family. Your indecision threatened that. Obviously, the choice had to be made for you since you refused to take that responsibility upon yourself."</p><p>"Yes," Ranma cried, "I refused! I refused to partake in soiling the honor of any family by forcing them to join with any family containing an honor-less thief like Genma Saotome. He has destroyed any honor the Saotome clan may have held many times over the past decade."</p><p>Nodoka's face turned ashen as she practically growled, "You will marry Akane. You no longer have a choice!" she stalked over to the racked honor blade, snatching it up off the supports and turned to face the redhead. "Too much depends on the joining of our clans for you to simply choose not to! I will NOT allow you to marry that, that, gaijin bimbo, or that low born cook's daughter!"</p><p>Ranma sighed as picked up her pack. "I will not marry any of the girls. I will deal with Xian Pu and the other Amazons. However, I will not, now or ever, marry anyone based on a promise by Genma Saotome. If I marry at all, it will be by MY choice. Furthermore, because all the promises Genma made were for his son to marry into the families, I removed Ranma from the family register, marking him deceased. Without the son on which all those engagements were based, Genma's honor-less promises cannot harm any more than the Saotome name. That name, he has already destroyed. Will you support my decision?" Ranma asked, her tone of voice pleading. "Will you allow me to be your daughter and help me restore the honor of the Saotome name?"</p><p>"NO!" Nodoka nearly shouted, "The future of the family demands you continue the Tendo-Saotome family legacy. You MUST marry Akane! If you do not, then you are no child of mine!"</p><p>"Why?" Ranma pressed, her voice quavering with barely suppressed anguish. "WHY must it be Akane? What is so important that you would force your own child into a loveless marriage? Why force the two of us to marry when we cannot even talk to each other anymore? Why not Kasumi, or even Nabiki? They are Tendo as well."</p><p>"It is not your place to question our reasons! Do you intend to prove yourself to be just like Genma?" the Saotome Matriarch sneered, "He never kept his word of honor. How are you any different if you run from this, and, and, hide as a girl?"</p><p>"I am nothing like Genma." Ranma snapped. She paused before continuing in a calmer voice, almost to herself. "It is amazing. You admit that Genma Saotome has no honor, yet you expect his worthless promises to be honored." Shaking her head, she looked into Nodoka's eyes and asked, "Are you trying to ensure a repeat of your marriage with Genma? Forcing Akane and I together would probably result in exactly that. At best, the relationship would be like yours, dysfunctional. At worst... "</p><p>"How dare you say that! You presume too much!" Nodoka hissed, the color that had drained from her face returned in a brilliant flush. "Get out! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! YOU are NOT welcome here until you return as my SON!"</p><p>Ranma sighed and nodded. "Saotome-san, you should know that I have already renounced the Saotome name. I had hoped you would see past this and allow me to be your daughter, even if I could no longer be your son." She stared hopefully into the older woman's eyes. After a short moment, the hope faded, and resignation replaced it. "Very well, as you wish. I am no longer your son, or even a man, Saotome-san. I renounced my male gender last night along with the Saotome name. Now I renounce any relation to you. Seek out Genma Saotome for an explanation as to why your son became your daughter, if you can find the coward. Look to your own actions here and now as to why she is now a stranger to you."</p><p>She moved for the door, passing the trembling crimson-faced woman.</p><p>Upon reaching the door, she turned and bowed toward Nodoka without looking at her. "Thank you for inviting me into your home, Saotome-san. I leave it as I entered it, alone. G-good-bye Nodoka Saotome." Stone faced, the young martial artist backed out of the Saotome residence.</p><p>The chauffeur patiently awaited his passenger by the limousine. He had not been dismissed as yet, so it was likely that the young lady would need his services again before this evening was through. Looking around the neighborhood, he noticed several people retreating from the streets, casting worried glances toward the home the young lady was visiting.</p><p>He hadn't been waiting even five minutes before the front door once again opened. His passenger strode quickly down the path and out the gate. She stopped just outside the gate, her gaze finally reaching him. Bowing, he asked, "Is there another destination to which I may drive you, Milady?"</p><p>"I - I thought you were only going to give me one ride," she said. Her emotionless voice matched her stony expression. The cheerful young lady that had entered this residence was gone. In her place, stood this somber teenager. The chauffeur wondered what could have happened to cause this reaction in such a short amount of time.</p><p>Opening the passenger door, he replied, "I am in your service for as long as you you desire it, Milady" Seeing her hesitation, he added, "Compliments of Milord Kuno."</p><p>"Well..." his charge began before turning her head to look back at the Saotome home. She frowned as her eyes narrowed. Before he could say anything further, she muttered softly, "Why do most of the women in my life all have to be so angry all the time?"</p><p>"Milady?" he asked, hoping to get the young woman to open up once more. 'What did that woman do to this child?' he asked in the privacy of his own thoughts.</p><p>She sighed. as she continued to stare at the house. He couldn't help but overhear as she began muttering to herself. "This part of my life is over. Time to move on. There is nothing remaining here for me... except Ucchan." she turned and stared at his limousine. "May as well take Tatewaki-kun up on his offer..."</p><p>She blinked a few times, and the stony expression changed into one of puzzlement as she continued to mutter, " Tatewaki-kun? What? Oh, to heck with it." Shaking her head, she looked up at him and smiled slightly. While it was not the brilliant, cheerful grin she had given him when they arrived here, it was a positive change.</p><p>"Thank you. I do have a few more places to visit today." She said accepting the offered ride.</p><p>The chauffeur slid in behind the wheel and moved the limousine into traffic. A few moments later, after she had settled, she gave him the next destination. After he acknowledged the order, he saw her turn her face to the window where the light caught on twin tracks glistening wetly on her face.</p><p>Shortly after the large black vehicle disappeared down the street, Nodoka Saotome exited her home carrying her familiar wrapped bundle. After looking around carefully, she frowned when failing to spot her 'son.'</p><p>Had anyone with the Sight been nearby, they would have clearly seen the dark crimson marks burning over her eyes like a second set of eyebrows. Those without the sight were easily able to spot the look of rage that washed over her face.</p><p>Turning, she hurried down the street toward the bus station. Catching up to her wayward offspring would be difficult, but not impossible.</p><p>Mercury looked up briefly as two of her teammates, Sailors Jupiter and Mars, landed near her.</p><p>"Well?" demanded Jupiter. "Where's the Youma?"</p><p>Mercury looked back at her computer before responding. "Whatever it was is no longer here."</p><p>"What?" Looking around, Jupiter planted her hands on her hips. "Aww, man," she whined. "I was so looking forward to a good fight."</p><p>Mars chose that time to speak up. "I - I don't think it was a Youma, Jupiter" She looked about with an uncharacteristic trepidation.</p><p>Mercury nodded. "I concur. Although there was a fair amount of Negaverse energy here, two other energy signatures are present. These other energy traces seem diametrically opposed and are canceling each other out as we speak. The darker one seems far stronger than any Youma."</p><p>The senshi of the Red Planet quietly added her own comment, "A Demon."</p><p>"A-a DEMON?" smirked Jupiter. "So, Mercury, what is the other energy source? A God?" her tone was somewhat sarcastic.</p><p>After a moment of searching the computer's database, Mercury looked back up at her teammate. "The data is inconclusive. The second signature was either not as strong as the first or was masking its power. As I was unable to detect it until we arrived, I presume the latter. Also, considering the lack of damage, I must conclude that whatever generated these energy signatures did not engage in direct conflict here."</p><p>A low chime rang from the little hand held computer, drawing Mercury's attention once more. Her eyebrows raised slightly at what her screen was showing her. "However, there is a correlation between these energy signatures and the signatures I detected in Nerima last month. The signatures are a 91.3 match."</p><p>"Hi, Guys!" A cheerful voice called out as another girl in a sailor fuku arrived.</p><p>Mars glared at the new arrival and growled out, "Bout time you showed up meatball head!"</p><p>"You are so mean!" Sailor Moon wailed. "I couldn't just leave in the middle of dinner! I got here as fast as I could."</p><p>"Hmpf! Whatever," the Senshi of Fire snorted. Returning her attention to Sailor Mercury, she asked. "There is a massive amount of ki in the area, it's very focused on the emotion of rage. Nobody could produce that much negative ki without being a Youma or worse. Is that one of these 'signatures' of yours?"</p><p>"It is certainly likely." Mercury replied after a moment. "I cannot verify which one, but if your feelings are correct, then it would be logical to assume that the stronger source was this 'negative ki' you mention."</p><p>Calming as quickly as she had burst into tears, Sailor Moon looked around and asked. "Where's Sailor Venus?"</p><p>Minako Aino, sometimes known as Sailor Venus, self proclaimed Senshi of Love, looked about her in confusion. She had been following this incredible hunk of a guy, trying to figure out a way to accidentally meet him on purpose.</p><p>Her communicator had beeped, distracting her for a moment. When she looked back up, he was gone. Desperate to get another look at him, she had searched for several more minutes before giving up once more. After giving up the search, she realized she had no idea of where she was.</p><p>Just as she had identified her surroundings, her communicator beeped again. Sighing, she lifted the little device. They would never believe her.</p><p>Sailor Moon was grinning from ear to ear as Minako's confused face appeared on the little screen of the communicator. "Your laaaate!" she sang before the other girl could respond.</p><p>Minako looked embarrassed as she replied. "You're not going to believe this, but... I saw this really cute guy." She started to get a dreamy look in her eyes, "He was such a porkchop!" she appeared to be about to say more before hearing the collective groan of the senshi interrupted her. "What?"</p><p>"D-don't you mean beefcake?" Jupiter asked.</p><p>"Well, I suppose you could say it that way, too," the blond said as she shook herself out of her daze. "But, that's not important," she frowned at the looks of shock from the other senshi. "What?"</p><p>"You, just said a cute guy wasn't important!" Jupiter cried.</p><p>"Yes, well, I was following him when you guys called the first time. You made me loose him," she accused, "after nearly an hour of following him!"</p><p>"So, where are you! We might have needed you here, you know." Mars demanded suddenly from over Moon's shoulder.</p><p>Minako blushed as she replied. "I... uhmmm... got lost. But, I finally figured out where I am when you called this time."</p><p>"So, where are you?" Mars asked.</p><p>Blushing even harder, Minako looked away from the communicator as she muttered something.</p><p>"Where?" Moon asked again, as she turned up the volume.</p><p>"Kyoto."</p><p>A moment of silence claimed the area before the shout of disbelief startled birds into the air, and rattled windows for blocks.</p>
